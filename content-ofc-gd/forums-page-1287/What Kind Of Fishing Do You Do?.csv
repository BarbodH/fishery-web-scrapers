22387,fish4me,2007-01-14 21:34:00,59,"I do 95% shore fishing, but love fishing from a boat.  I like BIG fish, carp, salmon, muskie, pike.  But really I fish for anything, love panfish also.  Most of the time I'm down in the lower niagara, TO islands, Rice lake, Lake St John,  Cooks Bay, all awesome fisheries!  Never fished the winter before, may try this year if possible (dam work!)"
22446,mikeh,2007-01-14 23:57:00,824,"75 % of the time I fish from a boat, targeting bass musky crappie 25 % shore fishing for carp,salmon,trout and  ice fishing for perch."

22560,kennyman,2007-01-15 04:20:00,737,"I guess I mostly fish from shore.......ponds,small lakes etc. I use my canoe for some small water as well. Rented a small tinny last year on Katchawanooka for a day,that was great! I'm hoping to get myself a 14 or 16 foot tiller this year and spend some more time in the Kawarthas. Life would be good. If not I guess I'll keep paddling. Actually either way I'll keep paddling. I love it..... but sometimes a tinny and a twenty's the way to go (especially for all day fishng on small lakes)."
22695,duber,2007-01-15 15:46:00,220,I'll fish for anything anytime anywere!
22739,wolfville,2007-01-15 17:26:00,396,"Carp 90% of the time, then bass, pickeral, pike, panfish the rest. The last carp caught lately was about a week ago, 11.5 lb."
22896,DarrenG,2007-01-16 01:21:00,2,"In spring, its Pike and Walleye.  Once the summer hits its 100% B-A-S-S.  In Fall (Starting in October) the target is usually Walleye and Musky and winter (when I can get out) its Lakers and Whities.  But nothing beats flippin' pads for 'ole bucket mouth in the summer."
23221,daisy_girl58,2007-01-17 00:31:00,116,"I like walleye and bass Husband likes a good fighting pike  Salmon was fun to catch this past year too.... But the most thrill I got was icefishing catching one after another....  Now if we could figure out how to get paid, let's say get paid 100,000 a year I would the most loyal worker everyday!  Lorissa"
21348,ccmtcanada,2007-01-11 14:59:00,7971,"Now that reports have slowed down, I thought I'd ask a question.  Do most members on this board concentrate on one type of fishing?  I personally am relegated to the shores of lakes...but have recently tried out trib fishing.  I love them both!"
21354,Rich,2007-01-11 15:10:00,3927,Anything and everything!

21410,SHAD,2007-01-11 17:23:00,134,"Looking back on the last two years, here's me schedule:  Spring = sliver kings and browns Summer = more kings, rainbows, the odd bass and eye trip Fall = even more kings, rainbows, browns, smallies, ski's and eye's Winter = rainbows and browns and lakers  No, the boat never get's put away"
21433,fishdawg,2007-01-11 18:48:00,912,"depending on the season, spot, & species targetted I do it all , some more then others become more of a troller though as of late"
21441,nautifish,2007-01-11 19:05:00,1416,I pretty much fish anything & everything.....Allthough we are all waiting for ice to come i also cannot wait for APRIL TO GET HERE getting up at 3.30am to go to a great perch spot to do some great very early morning perch fishing. Been doing that every yr for the last four yrs now. Roll on April.
21469,Greencoachdog,2007-01-11 20:13:00,8163,"For me, it's all about the boat! I can't see spending all that money buying it, and then just let it set there and not use it.  It's like Shad said... ""No, the boat never gets put away""."
21472,GbayGiant,2007-01-11 20:20:00,1780,It's all good.
21479,jordan,2007-01-11 20:31:00,136,I fish 4 rainbows mainly but if ican get out 4 other fish 2 i will maily rainbows though in small creeks as well as big rivers.   jordan
21483,xrap,2007-01-11 20:37:00,683,"All my fishig is done from shore. I like to fish for everything but my favourite is Pike, and this year i really got into trib fishing and i love it. Can't wait till spring"
21585,huntervasili,2007-01-12 00:59:00,1604,Love flyfishing in rivers/creeks but also enjoy the mobility of a boat and i will seldom refuse a chance to fish off shore either...
21587,fishindevil,2007-01-12 01:03:00,6254,"well cliff i prefer my boat of course,but given an oppourtunity i will fish anywhere and i do...but if i could only pick 1 it would be my LUND for sure"
21611,Bernie,2007-01-12 01:42:00,3190,"Love the blue water, sitting in the boat, maybe catching a few rays along with a few walleye."
21676,Pigeontroller,2007-01-12 04:18:00,2793,"I usually fish from my boat. Muskies mainly, Salmon/Trout, Bass. There's something nice about leaving the boat and gear behind and getting back to basics...As small stream and a rod."
21683,Cookslav,2007-01-12 04:41:00,1457,"Were ever the fish be....  9x outta 10 im on the rivers in my float boat, but I hit some small inland lakes as well in the float boat or canoe. But then again I hit the big water lakes a few times in a rental boat now and then...and of course fish the Shore for steelhead in the fall, and also spring sometimes.  No real favorite....I prefer the trips I catch fish"
21692,danbo,2007-01-12 07:13:00,2646,Any & all...luv flyfishing the most!!
21793,urbanangler1990,2007-01-12 20:03:00,933,"i mainly fish from shore for pike, bass, steel, and carp, been in a boat a few times and would love to but one for myself sooon lol..."
21794,dheitzner,2007-01-12 20:07:00,314,"my breakdown for a typical year: boat    60% trib     15% ice      25% although i really only fish from boat in the summer, fall/winter brings trib fishing and ice fishing (weather permiting of course).  i try to get the boat out as early as i can in the spring. regardless, i try to get out at least once a week(year round) to do some sort of fishing."
21938,Photoz,2007-01-13 11:46:00,792,"The first of the year I generally start off on the ice (but not THIS year, obviously) . . .      perch, lakers & whities, and crappie, if I can find the elusive wee boogers! Weather permitting I sometimes hit a few shore spots where rainbows hang out, then by April, ice is gone (hopefully) and again it's perch, crappies or rainbows. The Lake Simcoe sucker run is a lotta fun, I find the Beaverton area about the best spot to hang a chunk of worm under a slip float, light panfish gear, 3 or 4 pound test . . . .     a 3 to 5 pound sucker can put up a good scrap! In between I've sometimes tried washin' lures along the lakefront for pike . . .      got a quite a surprise last weekend when one hit hard enough on a red & white Daredevyl to almost take my rod. One jump, with a few violent headshakes, and thanks to me, some slack line and the spoon flew one way, and the pike, the other!! There goes my theory that pike are lethargic in cold water, THIS one sure wasn't, had to be 10+ pounds!! Then, by mid to late April . . . .      what I live for CARP!! Nothing like hearing your buzzer scream as 25 pounds of carp takes off like a freight train, almost smoking up your reel!! I fish them  . . . .     EVERYWHERE . . .    until the salmon start to come in if conditions are right, by early August, usually in the wee hours. Then, by October, back to rainbows, and perch, and the cycle starts again! Ain't life great??"
21968,Carp,2007-01-13 15:41:00,1488,"Salmon and trout on the great lakes are my favourite, but big water walleye  are a close second. I'll do some ice fishing for just about anything, but I'm usually  after lakers and whitefish.  I used to fish the rivers for trout when I was younger, but haven't been for quite some time.  I LOVE BEING IN THE BOAT ON BIG WATER BECAUSE IT USUALLY MEANS BIG FISH !!!"
22057,bdzyngel,2007-01-13 21:57:00,6,"In the summer I downrig at the cottage (Chrisitan Island - Georgian Bay) for steelhead, salmon and lake trout, and head up back home (White River) for two weeks every summer for pike, pickerel and specks...in the winter I fish simcoe for perch and whities and head back home for a week to hit the pike and splake...  This summer we had our best pickerel fishing in a long time on a lake back home - one after another until our limit for about two hours near sundown...  Although not really sportsmanlike (but nonetheless legal), we did some dipfishing for whitefish this fall near home - 65 over 4 nights.   Had my brother brine and smoke half of them - still a couple left in the freezer...  When you grow up in White River fishing, you can never shake the addiction...  BD"
22154,jjcanoe,2007-01-14 03:18:00,744,I love small stream trout fishing and do 75% of my fishing in rivers.  I do own a boat and have recently gotten into downrigging.  Love that too!  jjcanoe
22263,setomonkey,2007-01-14 16:34:00,872,"Done the shore and trib fishing thing but my favourite way to fish is from a boat.  I like moving around, trying different spots, finding offshore structure like weedbeds and humps, and if I have to, I'll troll some promising spots...  Mike"
