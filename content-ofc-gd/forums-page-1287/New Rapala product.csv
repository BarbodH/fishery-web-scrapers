23257,fishdawg,2007-01-17 02:18:00,912,seen a photo of a Rapala beer (bock style) a couple of years back in an In-Fisherman mag on the fish recipe page.
23280,snag,2007-01-17 03:28:00,1932,It's a human lure. Genius.
23286,danc,2007-01-17 03:43:00,4677,"I found this item on E Bay searching for Rapala stuff. It's tough to see in the photo, but this beer was made for an annual sales meeting in 2005. I used to collect beer cans as a hobby. In fact I have about 300 mostly full cans tucked away in the basement somewhere. It's common in the USA for beers to be made for a special event. I have several of them. Remember ""Billy Beer"", from Jimmy Carters brothers fame? I got one of them downstairs."
