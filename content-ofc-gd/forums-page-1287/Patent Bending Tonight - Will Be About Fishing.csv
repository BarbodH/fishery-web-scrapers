22824,Joey,2007-01-15 21:39:00,9122,"Just an FYI, I saw the commercial for a show called Patent Bending for tonight at 9:30 and it showed them trying to come up with new techniques to get your lure and line out as far as you can when fishing.  It looked interesting and I thought maybe some of you might want to watch it.  Its on the Discovery Channel at 9:30.  Joey"
22827,FinS,2007-01-15 21:44:00,463,ill be watching after guinea pig looks interesting

22858,wuchikubo,2007-01-15 23:11:00,1114,"I'll be at badminton tonight until 10pm, I hope someone can provide a summary."
22861,Clampet,2007-01-15 23:25:00,1947,"Patent Bending it is! Thanks for the tip, Joey. "

22877,urbanangler1990,2007-01-16 00:18:00,933,"sounds interesting, ill be tuned in."
22897,fishindevil,2007-01-16 01:25:00,6254,yes i have seen the show its a repeat and yes its very interesting  ..its worth watching cheers
22918,huntervasili,2007-01-16 02:29:00,1604,bringing this to the top cause its 9:30...
22925,ShaunB,2007-01-16 02:55:00,73,Yeah I just watched most of it.....  I don't know why someone wasted their money trying to patent that stuff.  When they went to the lake is it just me or did it totally look like Lake O?  I could have sworn it looked like Lake O in Mississauga.
22928,FishFinder,2007-01-16 03:00:00,481,kind of looked like port credit but lake O isnt salt water and that trout wasnt 4 lbs
22930,Joey,2007-01-16 03:06:00,9122,"   It was pretty neat.  But really, the only one that was the easiest, more affordable one was the gun.  The boat and helicopter probably cost a pretty penny, so I don't think it would be feasible (says the woman with at least $10,000 worth of fishing tackle   ).  Joey"
22934,Roy,2007-01-16 03:18:00,13728,"That was 30 minutes out of my already dwindling life expectancy. The only redeeming moment was when the chopper owner said: If the line gets tangled in the rear rotor, my chopper could get pulled into the lake."" To which Einstein smilingly replied: "" Right on!""."
22944,Fisherman,2007-01-16 03:47:00,7201,"That idea with the boat can be done, cheap 2 channel radio, might have to try that at Craigleith."
