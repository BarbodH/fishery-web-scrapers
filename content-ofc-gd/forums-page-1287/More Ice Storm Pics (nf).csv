A few weeks back Hydro came through our area and pruned back all the trees...very good timing! Anyway..we got power back so I don't have to use the laptop anymore. Here's a few pictures.. This is my backyard. I got a few hundred trees, so things may be messy! Here's a close up of one of my huge poplar trees. Glad they are very flexible! The neighbours maple trees are in some serious trouble I'm afraid. Yes the trees all had buds on them from the very mild winter. A few buds were actually starting to shed their shells.   We'll see what happens overnight. More snow is expected...if that happens we are totally screwed."

22943,Mike the Pike,2007-01-16 03:43:00,3421,Rick nice to hear the damage will be minimal.Today we got 18cm of snow in Montreal.Your pics remind of the ice storm here in 1998 .during the icestorm I had no power for 9 days luckily we have a wood stove so we just roughed it for 9 days.We actually boiled hot water to have a bath just like the old days.I had my in laws stay with us and another family it turned out to be one big party we were drinking and eating a great feast every night.We had alot of food that defrosted from our freezers so we just had a big feast and cooked it all on the woodstove.I had $7300.00 damage to my home my pool colapsed I lost all my eavesdrops and some heavy damage to my carport.  The best gift from all of this is I have an 8 year old son today from those 9 days.He is my fishing partner for years to come.  Thanks for the pics it brings back memories.  Mike
22956,bigfish1965,2007-01-16 05:08:00,3382,A big chunk of that maple tree in pic number 3 just came down..quite the noise it made too.
22958,Mike the Pike,2007-01-16 05:13:00,3421,Any damage Rick?I remember hearing many trees falling in 98.One tree falling that I will never forget .A huge branch fell on one of those old garden sheds you know the thin metal tinny ones.One huge branch and it was flattened the noise was deafeaning .Mike
22991,joefish,2007-01-16 13:30:00,165,"Hey Rick, see the Canpar truck in the third picture?  Thats Jason Young from your town.. Lives a few blocks away. Thats also who I work for, might show up at your door...."
23234,Nanook,2007-01-17 01:02:00,565,"We had some 80' Pine trees taken down last Nov.They were alongside the drive,and too  near the house. In Winter thay would get top heavy, and sway like crazy in a wind. Wifey got too squirly about them, so down they came.Three were hollow due to woodpeckers and sqirrels,so I guess they would come down soon anyway"
