23259,fishnpro,2007-01-17 02:27:00,93,Which side of the lake does your source check the ice because i dont think it is that thick by ceasarea.
23265,Sinker,2007-01-17 03:06:00,8692,"There was open water SW of Goreskis on Sunday.......I'm thinking your source is checking shore ice and that's about it. Guys were fishing thru the ice in a boat there on sunday......they had a puddle about 40yds round, around them......the ice was flexing that much!!  I'd say the weekend will be good to go......but for now, play it safe! Lots of springs in there, so ice thickness is different all over the place.....if you don't know the ice, be very careful and check as you go.  Sinker"
