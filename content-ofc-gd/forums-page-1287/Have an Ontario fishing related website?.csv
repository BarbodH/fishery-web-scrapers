It tracks sites and the hits they get and ranks websites accordingly. These are popular traffic generators and help bring people to your website. If your site is relevant to fishing in ONTARIO, feel free to sign up. The software will guide you through the process and give you the code to plug into your page. All applications need approval from us prior to being published (to stop spam bots). Sign up at http://www.ofncommunity.com/topsites/  Sites with refresh scripts or other methods of faking traffic will be deleted from the list."
