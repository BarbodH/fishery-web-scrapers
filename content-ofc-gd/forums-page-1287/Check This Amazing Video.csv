22906,nautifish,2007-01-16 01:56:00,1416,  The aliens built them clampet.........lol    The Mystery is not just about how they got there but also why are they there. There are different oppinions why . Its a beautiful place my 1st time there i was around 11 yrs old before they fenced it all off to the public. Sadley pollution is  now slowly distroying the stone.  I am not sure if anyone else here has been to stone henge  but there is most certainly an erie feeling when you walk around.  Its really hard to tell just how tall these stones are on pictures but trust me they are huge!!
