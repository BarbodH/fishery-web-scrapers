Also curious is there any form of auto pilot, that say, follows contours off your gps/finder... What about top of the line stuff.  Why is it not made yet..  Mabye I should pattent that.  The new lowrance 111 hooked to your kicker..."
23082,gforce,2007-01-16 19:00:00,63,how about a trolling motor that chases the biggest fish in the lake?
23083,bassjnkie,2007-01-16 19:02:00,1101, I was watching a walleye fishing program on WFN. The trolling motor was set up to stay in a certain depth. I think it was a motoguide. Is that what you are looking for?
23085,GbayGiant,2007-01-16 19:08:00,1780,Yes motorguide has that option.
23091,Terry,2007-01-16 19:29:00,14456,"yeah, last week someone asked the same question here ans I posted a link  to the motor that does it do a search and you will find it"
23123,irishfield,2007-01-16 21:00:00,26272,If you are talking full boat steering auto pilot....put the boat in gear and follow a course...yes it's out there...been out there for well over decade. Had a tool maker with a large sailboat that ran a race on Lake O that way. Once around the markers to plot the course and everyone below deck to drink...at least 'till they got disqualified.  There was a guy at Picton when we were all down there in November that had it on his Ranger. Plug in the way points on the screen of his Lowrance and that's where the boat takes him. Be great for solo fishing your favourite lake that's for sure. Think it's the only option I missed when ordering my new Lund.
