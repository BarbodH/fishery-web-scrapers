If anyone knows of a place I'd appriciate it 18 x 24 x 3 inches would be  ideal. The 3"" thick is the improtant part.  Thanks in advance  and this may be of interest to some      http://fishnflush.com/"

I've been there a couple of times for foam to build some Halloween costumes for the kids.  173 Bartley Drive North York, ON M4A 1E6  (416) 755-4288  Its located at Victoria Park and O'Connor in Toronto.  I think there is another shop my Dad also uses near Pickering if thatâ€™s better let me know and I can find out more about that one.  Pinch"

23222,Pinch,2007-01-17 00:35:00,231," Thats a shame.  I just went in and asked for what I needed and they gave it to me without any problems.  Unless they told you they wouldnt sell to you, I'd just go in and ask for it."
