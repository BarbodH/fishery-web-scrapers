22887,Terry,2007-01-16 00:39:00,14456,"for the most part I agree with Gerritt when I saw the photos, I quit reading the report...just because I thought it was silly....... when I saw lots of people replyng I too a second look Puckhead has some great points too, if you don't want people to see the background snap a picture of the fish on the ground or in the water  and if you are going to post something on a message  board you have to expect people to comment on what they read and see, both good and bad, if you don't want to see negative replies, then this is the wrong place to hang your hat, I like that people are honest here and say what they thing...the good the bad and the ugly"
22888,ChrisK,2007-01-16 00:50:00,2772,"I for one personally enjoy the photoshop backgrounds. It brings a new light to our board through personal expression...I don't think everyone willl jump on the band wagon and do the same and that is precisely makes us different from eachother...Personal expression, its OK to be different...... If FF wants to photoshop then he can do just that..If we don't like it than we can move to the next thread and read something else so lets stop beating this fellas posts into the ground everytime he posts a pic of himself with a fish...."
22878,Puckhead,2007-01-16 00:18:00,377,"I really don't see the point of posting yourself in the pics at all?? Might as well just snap a close up of the fish.  It makes little sense to me why anyone would go to the trouble of taking a portrait of themselfs if they are going to photoshop the whole thing?  And besides, your getting enough heat on the photoshopping bit anyway, don't bother with the effort if no one is going to appreciate it.  If you are protecting your spot(s), and not intending to make a ""look at me"" post, do what everyone else does - post a close up pic of the fish on the bank.  Less fuss and far less effort...  For examples, check out just about every CC report. CC guards his spots like a pro - without being obnoxious about it."
22880,Gerritt,2007-01-16 00:22:00,6129,"  You assume I am being negative.... quite the opposite... I am simply stating the pictures that are edited, in the manner in which it seems a SELECT few steelheaders have been posting are some what fake... and are seen by many as just that...  I am not trying to insult you in any way.. sorry if you think that... this is just simply not the case..  There are ALOT of people on this board that have been here for along time... and until this year it seems this didnt go on...  I have recieved a ton of pms regarding this thread... most 95% are in favour of what the other posters before Me posted in this thread...  I have also recieved two that were in your favour...so you do have supporters  again I am not against you nor am I against your reports... just the manner in which pictures are being posted not only by you.   Have a great night! this will be my last post on this subject.  Gerritt."
22883,Roy,2007-01-16 00:28:00,13728,"Well, I've had a close look at all four pictures and I'd say that that 3rd picture is definitely Photoshopped."
22884,irishfield,2007-01-16 00:32:00,26272,I think the pro/con of photoshopping a background should be taken to a seperate thread. Why beat this kids posts to death every time....
