22240,Bly,2007-01-14 15:24:00,1556,"Try this.....  Advanced Taxidermy  Hope this is the one you are looking for, they came highly recommended when I was asking around  blyght"
22241,motv8tr,2007-01-14 15:30:00,2587,"Is this the one???  JJ's Taxidermy - 905-846-0912 15 Penn Drive, Brampton, ON L7A 1N9  Maureen"
22244,HookNrelease,2007-01-14 15:36:00,85,"thanks Maureen, that was the one, $7.00 an inch for a replica. thanks again Ian"
22289,irishfield,2007-01-14 17:27:00,26272,If you kept it...why get a replica. Get the real thing...
22303,motv8tr,2007-01-14 18:23:00,2587,"No problem, just looked it up in the yellow pages at Canada411  Glad I could help Maureen"
22483,fishindevil,2007-01-15 01:00:00,6254,well you may pay more for advanced taxidermy  but go to their website and check their work out they have won just about every award there is...so its like the old saying... YOU ONLY GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR..... cheers
22553,Carp,2007-01-15 03:58:00,1488,  The real fish will leak natural oils eventually Wayne. I think the skin will also lose some of it's shine. Replicas last much longer for about the same cost.
22634,HookNrelease,2007-01-15 14:06:00,85,"Irish,  yes i kept the fish cause (one) it was weighed in for the derby 33lbs and (two) i didnt know what to do about a mount. The guy told me yesterday that a salmon skin mount will last approx 5 years  and then start to deteriorate, at what rate depends on the location its in, could last 20 years, a replica all he needs is the length and girth and will last a life time fo a $1.00 an inch more !!!! This fish was caught by my daughter so id like for her to have it a long time, as for advanced, yes they do have a nice website and you cant doubt there work, however, they will not give you a price or even a ball park till your there and then they set the hook,,,hahahahah,, JJ if im correct used to work at advanced and then started his own line so hopefully all should be ok, and he did come recomended by a few board members also. Will let you know how it turns out . Again thnx for the assistance guys Cheers ian"
22723,irishfield,2007-01-15 16:50:00,26272,"Guess it all depends how good the taxidermist is I guess and how patient he is waiting for it to dry out before painting. I had mine done by a young lad that was just starting out back in 1983 in Milton. For a $100, I think it was, he did my Chinook that I caught under the Bronte Creek Bridge in Oakville. Not the greatest job...but it looks exactly the same 23 years later (other than some broken fin tips)! "
22753,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-15 18:00:00,0,"It was me that posted JJ's number.  John does very good work, you'll be pleased.    I agree with you Wayne, the first fish I ever had mounted in 1983 has faded but she still looks good."
22760,Terry,2007-01-15 18:08:00,14456,"when I checked on pricing , a replica was twice the price of a skin mount.....ouch"
22780,HookNrelease,2007-01-15 19:19:00,85,"Irish, nice fish for sure Terry, JJ gave me a price of $7.00 an inch for a replica I personally thought that was a real good deal, give me a few weeks and ill post a pic of how it turns out cheers ian"
22783,Terry,2007-01-15 19:32:00,14456,yeah that does sound like a good deal
