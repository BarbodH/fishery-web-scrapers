22796,lew,2007-01-15 20:42:00,12767,"A tanker truck carrying liquid oxygen rolled over on HWY 400 around Steeles awhile ago and the hwy is closed completely in BOTH directions till at least after the rush hour.  Just a heads-up for any OFNers who plan on using  the road in the next few hours, specially those trying to get outta Toronto tonight..  Sorry to spoil your day folks"
22803,motv8tr,2007-01-15 20:52:00,2587,"Wow, I heard on the noon news that a truck had jack-knifed and had the 400 NB closed, wonder if it's the same one or a second bone head as they still had the SB open at that time.  I was surprised to hear it was closed both ways and can't believe it will take them that long to clear it.  Rush hour tonight is going to be a night mare...  Be carefull out there folks...  Maureen"
22805,lew,2007-01-15 20:57:00,12767,"Mo, the news said they closed both lanes because they need to bring in another truck to off load the oxygen and they want to keep the area clear incase anything happens during the transfer."
22807,irishfield,2007-01-15 20:59:00,26272,Glad I didn't head for the boat show today Lew....you had the right idea...stayin home!
22808,joonmoon,2007-01-15 21:01:00,528,Anyone got a light?
22810,dsn,2007-01-15 21:03:00,1018,Yeah I heard that too. Heres the pic.    I didn't know about this one though. Saw it on citynews webpage 
22813,T-Bone,2007-01-15 21:09:00,160,"Yeah...from what I see that thing is not going anywhere for awhile. This refreshes every 90-seconds...so those of you at work still can ""monitor"" the progress.    Whoops...forgot link.  http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/traveller...era/camhome.htm"
22821,Joey,2007-01-15 21:37:00,9122,"Wow, scary stuff.  Thanks Lew.  Joey"
22823,FinS,2007-01-15 21:38:00,463,i heard something about a big car pile up is this true
22852,TAH,2007-01-15 22:34:00,133,I just heard on the news that the 400 HWY wouldn't be opened until midnight or later. and the south bound lanes are also closed at HWY 7
22856,motv8tr,2007-01-15 22:56:00,2587,"Well clearly the noon news did not give all the info, all they said was a jackknife, nothing about a roll over....shouldn't be surprised I guess.  I feel for those trying to get in or out of the city tonight...hope my brother stayed home.  Maureen"
22939,bigbuck,2007-01-16 03:39:00,2449,"That baby would 'blow up real good' like my old friend John Candy would have said if someone lit a match. One of my colleagues lives in Barrie, I gave him a heads up call, I wonder how he made it home. (mind you, the guy knows every sideroad in Southern Ontario)"
22945,Joey,2007-01-16 03:50:00,9122,Looks like they're still working on it now.    Joey
