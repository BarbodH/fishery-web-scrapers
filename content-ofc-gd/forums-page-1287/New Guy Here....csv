22255,tjsa,2007-01-14 16:03:00,1578,"Welcome aboard Mark, glad you found us. Fishing is the main thing that brings everyone here, but this place is much more than that. It's called OFC, Ontario Fishing Net Community, and it is a community. If you have a problem with your furnace, shingles, brick, vehicle, computer, health, etc. etc.....post away. This place is not just a fishing message board, it is way, way, way,  more than that. The love of fishing is the thing that brings us here all together, but we will help you and anyone else who signs up as a member with almost anything that happens in your daily life.  And, we like pictures. So take lots of them, and post them."

22294,Markystang,2007-01-14 17:48:00,131,"Thanks all!! Alright, a bit about me...I'm 29, married, 2 kids and live in Waterloo. I've lived here most of my life. I've only been big into fishing for the past few years. I used to fish once in a while, but I enjoy it much more now. I mostly bass fish right now. I can always seem to find good bass fishing. I enjoy other species, and have been known to eat a fresh lake trout or two, but bassin' is my favourite.    btw, I've got a couple pics of a 4lb smallie I caught last summer, but I can't get them to post..."
