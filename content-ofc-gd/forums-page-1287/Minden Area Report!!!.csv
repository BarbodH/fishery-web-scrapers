22042,jeffw,2007-01-13 20:57:00,267,"I went out with troutologist today and fished a small lake off 35 north of minden. We found a average of 3' but some places had 2"" and some had 4"". After about 4 hours of fishing he caught a nice fat 16"" splake and I had 2 hits. All an all a good day and thanks again troutologist for the good day. Chhers Jeff"
22054,Smokey,2007-01-13 21:48:00,1278,Thanks for the report Jeff. I think the weather this week will sure up the ice a bit better and there will be more fishing to come.
22144,troutologist,2007-01-14 01:33:00,951,Ya it was a great day to be out for sure. Early wake up and met up with Jeff in Minden. I had to dig the gad out of the hole that splake took it so hard. There was a big difference in the ice from first thing this morning to the afternoon when the sun had hit it. The walk back to the road was fun. Thanks again Jeff for the great day on the slush.
22155,Carp,2007-01-14 03:33:00,1488,"In a few days, you won't have to worry much about ice thickness. Cold is on the way.  The fish co-operated and you made it back O.K. 2"" of ice and the sun beating down ? I like to see a few inches more than that before venturing out."
22269,fishboy,2007-01-14 16:43:00,550,nice work; the ice should be growing quite a bit this week given the forecast
22304,wuchikubo,2007-01-14 18:29:00,1114,"Thanks for the update Jeff, sorry, I couldn't make it up there today, I'll have to meet up with you in the near future.  HF"

I guess you could always cast! If you need more info at the end of the week let me know I drive around it everyday"
