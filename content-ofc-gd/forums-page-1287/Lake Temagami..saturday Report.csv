22696,drifter,2007-01-15 15:47:00,12,"Well three of us headed up north saturday @ 3 am. After hearing about the ice not safe on Nippising we decided to head further north.  Got a phone call from the wife around 5:30 to see if we were ok and ask if one of my friends ( newbie) had forgotten his snowpants LOL. We arrived at the end of the Lake Temagami access road at 7:30am. First light WOOHOO!!!  Unloaded our gear and we were off. Saw a snowmoblier coming off the ice as we were walking out. ( Good sign). We walked out for 5 minutes and drilled a hole. 5"" of ice. Tried here for a bit and didn't mark anything. We continued to move around and found 4-5"" in most areas and a few spots were soft. Aound 10 oclock I drilled a hole  and my Friend (newbie) was watching how the flasher worked as I was explaining to him how it worked I marked a fish and as I was working my spoon the fish continued to watch it until he decide to hit it. FISH ON!!!  As I battled him for a few minutes I pulled out a walleye!! Took a quick measurement and picture 23""  and chunky...in the slot size DOH!! back in she goes. Drop the spoon right back down and jig it for a couple minutes and mark a fish from the bottom and  it came right up a foot fast and furious. FISH ON. I hand over the rod to my friend and he battles it for a minute and FISH OFF!!! So we stayed here for a bit and after another hour my other friend gets one on he losses it at the hole. A nice 15-17"" walleye. We hit another dry spell for a bit and then my friend has one on. HE brings it up a nice 2-3 lb laker quick pic and back she goes. We continued to mark fish but that was it for us . There was another group of guys come out and we invited them over. They landed 2 small lakers too.  Well it was good to finally get out on the ice. Just what the doctor ordered. Sorry, I had a bunch of pictures but, as we were driving home I got tired and switched drivers and as I got out of the seat I think I dropped my camera. So if anyone finds a camera along Hwy 11 it may be mine. If anybody decides to go out make sure your careful. Let the drillin begin.  Thanks for reading."
22713,irishfield,2007-01-15 16:28:00,26272,Thanks for the report Drifter. Pretty good since that was open water not more than 4 days ago !! Good to see weather normality has finally returned in the north.  Did you have a good lock under the seat mounts for the camera?
22715,Smokey,2007-01-15 16:35:00,1278,"Great report, Thanks. Surprising there not much ice up there yet cause the nights have been a bit cool. Nice to hear you caught a few fish and had a good time."
22721,drifter,2007-01-15 16:44:00,12,Irisfield: Yeah I did have a good look under the seat mounts. Nada. I am cleaning out my gear later today. Hopefully it turns up. To tell you the honest truth I don't care about the camera I just want the pictures. Oh well At least I got the memories. They last a lifetime.!!! You are lucky Irishfield. That was our first time there. it is absolutely beatiful up there.  Smokey:  I'm surprised too. It was cold in the morning that day. I feel for my friend. It was -27 that morning. I gave him my over alls and that helped him. He was a trooper and didn't even complain all day. It was beatuiful all day once the sun came out.

22774,drifter,2007-01-15 18:50:00,12,"We have a bungalow booked for this weekend on Nippising. If its a no go, were going to rent a room somewhere up there and either fish nippising or temagami again. I can't wait!!! I will be going back up there when the season for lakers opens for sure!!"
22811,irishfield,2007-01-15 21:06:00,26272,"I'd imagine Temagami Shores has some rooms available, with the trails not open yet for sledders. Also Loon Lodge right where you were fishing.  Aaron....send me a PM. I'll be up there in March as well, with a gang...that doesn't sound good but heck these guys together will look like one!"
