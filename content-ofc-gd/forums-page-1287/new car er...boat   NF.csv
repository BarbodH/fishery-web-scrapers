23224,Garyv,2007-01-17 00:39:00,547,The vehicle is just a new Hi-Tech variation of the original Amphicar from the 60's  Check out the club site and view an original invoice.  Selling price in 1964 $2818.50 My wife's uncles neighbor in Lake Geneva Wisconsin had one and we used to go for rides in the lake on occasion.  Wasn't to fast but you sure got a lot of looks.  http://www.amphicar.com/
