22639,Eddyk,2007-01-15 14:13:00,195,I used to repair broken water mains for about 30 years and regardless of the weather we had to be out there. The phone would go off and you would get up in the middle of the night and never give it a second thought no matter what the weather was like outside. Who else ?
22643,Pigeontroller,2007-01-15 14:21:00,2793,"I do usually work outside all winter, but not when its like this! Handling glass gets abit dicey when its wet!"

22671,motv8tr,2007-01-15 15:15:00,2587,"I used to when I worked at Toronto hydro, but usually it had to be an emergency for us to go out in this.  Now I just drive in this mess, not as bad as being outside somedays, but then, I do have to go outside to get the customer...so I guess I kinda still work outside...  Maureen"

22726,irishfield,2007-01-15 16:58:00,26272,I guess I should get out there and at least shovel the path from the back door to the workshop.....to make it look like I did something out there today! LOL  Guess I may need to plow the laneway as well...dang...  No Eddy...never worked outside during the winter...unless I wanted to...

22902,OhioFisherman,2007-01-16 01:45:00,6623,"I started working on the truck docks in 73, a roof but no heat, kind of like a wind tunnel, whatever it was doing outside you got a piece of. 20 below? ya on the dock too! Driving a tractor trailer and trying to keep some kind of schedule was interesting too. Still better than being stuck inside behind a machine or desk not knowing what`s happening outside."
