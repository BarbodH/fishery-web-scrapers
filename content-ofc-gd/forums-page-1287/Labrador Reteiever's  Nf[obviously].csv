Any Lab. owners out there have good pics you would like to share? I need head shots,showing the eyes VERY clearly. Full frontal and side shots would be ideal. Its the eyes that are important. I'm trying to get a carving of a Lab. head done, and the eyes have got me beat. Any help would be greatly appreciated. You can send them by PM or e-mail or post them here of course"
