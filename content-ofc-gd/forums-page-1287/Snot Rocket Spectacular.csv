22376,Rich,2007-01-14 21:13:00,3927,Sleded and I took the day today to target pike. It was tough fishing but we managed 4 snot rockets for our efforts and missed 2 more. All of them were caught on a perch colored X Rap.. the key to making them hit was LONG pauses. 30 - 40 seconds before twitching the bait. It's Sleded's birthday tomorrow so he got a couple of real nice presents.        
22378,bassmaster4,2007-01-14 21:16:00,801,nice fish boys HAPPY BIRTHDAY SLEDED
22381,mason05,2007-01-14 21:18:00,258,"Nice job guys!  The perch xrap has also been doing well for me when targeting pike.  The same technique you mentioned worked well in the frigid water.  Long pause, super slow retreive.  I lost two yesterday and one today.  This weather could spell the end of soft water pike until spring though.  I checked out your episodes of Action Angling yesterday and I must say you have quite the show there.  I'm not sure how far you are looking to persue it but I've got a buddy that can produce, film and edit who might be interested in taking it to the next step.  Corn Nug"
