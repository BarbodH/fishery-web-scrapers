22831,nautifish,2007-01-15 21:51:00,1416,Those are beautiful shots guy's. We had a hydro pole down here in dover this afternoon that actually caused a fire. Was talking to one of the fire officers said that there is so much going on right now as in accident and  poles and trees coming down they cannot keep up.  I guess apparentley we are in for some high winds tonight and snow which i did not know. But i was told it is going to get worse before it gets better so stay safe out there everyone.  My back deck i swear must have an inch thick of ice on it right now you could put skates on and skate on it...lol    Sorry about the sideways picture....lol
