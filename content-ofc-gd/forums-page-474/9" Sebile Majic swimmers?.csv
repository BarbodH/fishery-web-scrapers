634817,hirk,2011-10-27 16:51:00,571,Anyone tried these for Musky/Pike? Just wondering if they work and hold up ok or do they get destroyed?
634822,Roy,2011-10-27 17:16:00,13728,I have not used them but they must be good. Maina uses them and he never cheaps out on baits. I think he's sponsored by Sebile but I'll trust his word anytime.
634826,manitoubass2,2011-10-27 17:33:00,11391,"I've never used them, but I'm sure they'll work, just like everything else we toss in the water  Give em a try and report back (hopefully with a pic of a trophy musky!)"
635140,singingdog,2011-10-28 10:03:00,1047,I know a couple of hard-core pike guys that use them with good luck. I hope they work for the big-toothy critters. They certainly don't get good reviews as a bass lure.
