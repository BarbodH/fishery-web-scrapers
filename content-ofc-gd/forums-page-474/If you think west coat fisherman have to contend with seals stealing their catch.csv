635045,captpierre,2011-10-28 00:51:00,2521,Incredible! If you think about it.  We're all lazy.  Even the bears.  Why work for your dinner.
635046,vance,2011-10-28 00:53:00,719,SO whats the limit on polar bears
635047,tjsa,2011-10-28 00:57:00,1578,"OK, the site I got it off of, one guy fishes the west coast and says it is not a polar bear, but a Stellar Sea Lion. Could be. Who knows.  http://www.at-you.net/archives/polar-bear-steals-fish/"
635048,BillM,2011-10-28 00:57:00,17367,That looks like a leopard seal to me..  Definitely not a polar bear.  No claws are visible and it takes off with a big swoosh at the end.  Definitely a seal of some kind.
