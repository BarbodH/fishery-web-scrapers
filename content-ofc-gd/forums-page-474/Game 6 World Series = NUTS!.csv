635113,tb4me,2011-10-28 04:40:00,3295,I dont watch Baseball but when my sister sent me a text message to put it on I had to see what the hub bub is all about...Glad I did..These fans are getting every cent out the money spent tonight....Oh St Louis just won it as I type!!...Wow
635114,Hooked,2011-10-28 04:45:00,891, Yes....it was a crazy game and I am sad now.  Lots of epic moments in that game!  Amazing..wow!
635115,kickingfrog,2011-10-28 04:47:00,8333,NUTS!
635117,backbay,2011-10-28 04:50:00,773,"Best and worst game ever, all rolled into one!"
635118,Hooked,2011-10-28 05:00:00,891," So true....it was frustrating to me, that game should of been finished by Texas.  It drives me crazy when pitchers who throw hard don't go to their sliders more often....but Andrus should of went to second to get that out!  Oh well, bring on game 7!"
635423,kickingfrog,2011-10-28 23:32:00,8333,Hope not but... Game 7 is likely going to be a dud.
635424,misfish,2011-10-28 23:43:00,29133," Rob,I sure hope my batteries hold up. It,s the MLB,THE CFL (Boatmen and the Pegs),Colts vs battalions on local 10.Channel surfing is happening here.  Oh to stay with the post,,,,,,,,,  Rangers take it."
635529,Billy Bob,2011-10-29 13:41:00,5865,I will predict the Cardinals win game 7 by the score of 6-2.....
635555,uglyfish,2011-10-29 14:53:00,981,"Was a great game and a great series! Being a braves fan, kinda sours me to see st. Louis win, my dad and brother are cards fans. But I do like the cards, living in hamilton, way back we used to have the cards AAA minor league team here, so I have a soft spot for the club."
635561,misfish,2011-10-29 15:46:00,29133,  Great game til the end.
