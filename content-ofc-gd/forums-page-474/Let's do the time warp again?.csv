635178,Roy,2011-10-28 13:01:00,13728,"Time warp? You want time warp? I lived in a house in the mid 60's for about a year ...95 Chester Avenue in Toronto. The rent was $125. a month. I could have bought it for $12,000.00 Well, this morning early I was surfing and checked out where I've lived in the past....not many places. The place looks decent enough on Google maps. Well the house about 4 doors away is presently for sale for a million dollars! DANG!"
