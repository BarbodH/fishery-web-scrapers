635103,mk2vr6,2011-10-28 03:31:00,14," haha, no, a different ny trib... out that way.  i did stop at burt to watch that show too.  not sure where to head this weekend!  might stick local...  you headed anywhere?"
635227,BillM,2011-10-28 15:35:00,17367,"Nah, moving my sister this weekend from London to Barrie.  I might get out in the new boat on Sunday with the oldman however, we'll see."
635230,Harrison,2011-10-28 15:50:00,2202,I wouldn;t bother this weekend either eh Bill.  Here is the forecast. 
635231,BillM,2011-10-28 15:52:00,17367,LOL!!!   I don't mind low and gin clear
635550,Guest chase4chrome,2011-10-29 14:47:00,0,"Sounds like you guys frequent the NY tribs as I do--have been holding off until now. Let me know whether there are any trips pending--wouldn't mind sharing some water. BTW some nice water was to be had on Bronte with steelhead beginning to move in ( yesterday's results, see below). All the best gents."
632977,JTorra,2011-10-21 20:51:00,50,Thanks Bill..I will be sure to stay home and not even think about being on a river....  You sure are 'tooned in to what is going on.
632990,Bill Shearer,2011-10-21 21:34:00,456,"Anybody who is a real serious steelheader, will know that the options are slim this weekend! However they will also know that the possibilities open up with The weather of November. The clouts that haunt the salmon runs are long gone, and the real serious guys will be there."
632998,BillM,2011-10-21 21:45:00,17367," If there was a month to book off work, November would be it!"
633015,kingofthesteelhead,2011-10-21 22:57:00,140,"You lads aren't very optimistic are you! Dropped my wife off at work and a local trib runs close to there,well yesterday it was fairly high and dirty,but today it was cleared up and very fishable.By tomorrow it will be too clear except in the lower area down by the lake.Don't feel like fighting crowds anyway,so I will just go slay some jumbo perch!"
633030,solopaddler,2011-10-21 23:40:00,8605,"Had a fantastic day today, crushed 'em.  The weekend will be even better."
633034,Twocoda,2011-10-21 23:50:00,4130, beercans?
633036,denisk,2011-10-21 23:52:00,163,"I started at 18 erie and drove to the PA line and it was all MUD yesterday, spoke with guys who drove from Cleveland and it was the same story thru Ohio and PA.   Gas is 1.34 a gallon on the rez so it wasn't a total loss   I did manage to find some clear puddle water but the bite was slow  "
633043,solopaddler,2011-10-22 00:23:00,8605, We did the same run last Sunday with pretty much the same results.  Fished north today and my 5 year old boy caught his first steelhead. Banner day all around.
633052,DRIFTER_016,2011-10-22 00:40:00,10439,  Where's the video Mike.
633502,Paulus,2011-10-24 00:46:00,522," Sweet! Congratulations to Solopaddler mini-me  Here's what the conditions of the weekend yielded for me, despite getting cheated (defective alarm clock) out of my favourite fishing spot...    Bill, you trickster! The water was just fine .  p.-"
633516,BillM,2011-10-24 01:28:00,17367,My plan only partially worked!  Muahahahha..  
633642,johnnyb,2011-10-24 13:49:00,3413,LOLOLOL  Nice work Dr. Evil
633695,Paulus,2011-10-24 15:43:00,522, I will call him .... Mini Me ....  p.-
633696,blaque,2011-10-24 15:44:00,2419,"lol, this thread is too funny.  Fyi, i found perfect water friday.......and not so perfect (but surely fishable) water sunday.  I did better in Fridays water"
633717,DRIFTER_016,2011-10-24 16:57:00,10439,  Hey Paul Sorry about your rod. A little duct tape and buffing compound should have it looking like new.
633733,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-10-24 17:39:00,0,no 2 river is the same and at least one of them will always be fishable.
633739,Paulus,2011-10-24 18:08:00,522,  wha???  ...
633822,mk2vr6,2011-10-24 22:55:00,14,"some lake o tribs in ny were deece sunday, minus all the salmon yahoos at the dams... what a show."
633832,misfish,2011-10-24 23:32:00,29133, I gots to buy me a ticket one day to see this.  Bill thats a sweet fish bud.   Just trying to figure out where ya found that clear water? LMAO
633839,Roy,2011-10-24 23:45:00,13728,It's obviously photoshopped. There's no centerpin.
633864,BillM,2011-10-25 00:32:00,17367,"  Dude, you went to Burt?  LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I gotta bring a video camera down there.  You get any roe wagons?"
633870,solopaddler,2011-10-25 00:45:00,8605,  I did.
633874,DRIFTER_016,2011-10-25 00:53:00,10439, Me too.
635007,SirCranksalot,2011-10-27 23:16:00,3291,"I'm wondering if it's the high water (the volume) that kills the fishing, or is it the clarity or lack thereof i.e the turbidity?"
635064,BillM,2011-10-28 01:41:00,17367," Clarity, or lack thereof."
632516,BillM,2011-10-19 23:49:00,17367, Let's hope she's hot!
632517,cuzza,2011-10-19 23:53:00,467," Cheers - gonna head somewhere closer to home and see how it looks first thing. Even if it's blown, it beats going to work!  Apologies to all the OFC steelheaders for jinxing the weather"
632518,MJL,2011-10-19 23:54:00,2427," No Roy...Cliff will be there for 2 reasons  A. When I fish with him and a hungry black bear comes, Cliff will be the one that gets eaten because he runs slower  B. If we get to the river and the conditions are bad, we’ll have to appease the river gods by offering Cliff as a temporary sacrifice...Duct taping him to a tree for the weekend should work.  I know Cliff is a team player and there’s no one more honorable than him to accept both roles"
632520,GBW,2011-10-19 23:58:00,8460,BAAAHAHAHAHA
632529,Roy,2011-10-20 00:26:00,13728," Mike if you promise to make good on both A and B, I'll overnight you a bottle of BBQ sauce (topical and non-allergenic) and a case of duct tape."
632536,ccmtcanada,2011-10-20 00:54:00,7971,Mike...it's a long walk back buddy!!!  And Roy...what did I ever do to you?? LOL.  And I'm leaving the camera at home...one of you three can figure out who is doing the report!
632606,solopaddler,2011-10-20 13:30:00,8605,"Billy, what is this? You know damn well the fishing will be great this weekend LOL!"
632609,craigdritchie,2011-10-20 13:39:00,1586,It just depends how far you want to drive. Conditions were great in Vancouver when I was there earlier this week.
632614,Headhunter,2011-10-20 13:55:00,5703,Bah ha ha ha... Cliff is leaving the camera at home... bah ha ha ha ... That's the funniest thing I have read here in a while! HH
632679,misfish,2011-10-20 19:42:00,29133, 
632680,Musky or Specks,2011-10-20 19:48:00,2710,All this rain could really turn the shore at Leith on.
632706,lew,2011-10-20 21:04:00,12766,"A few of us are heading down to LSC early tomorrow morning for 3 days of musky fishing and the reports say the rivers & lake are totally blown, but I sure wouldn't let poor conditions keep me away.  And it's absolutely guaranteed that nooooobody will catch a fish from their living room couch this weekend"
632712,misfish,2011-10-20 21:28:00,29133,  They are calling for a nice day Saturday Lew. Maybe sunday will be worth a walk.  Have a great weekend. Be safe all.
632723,kemper,2011-10-20 21:57:00,2232,.
632750,GbayGiant,2011-10-20 23:52:00,1780,Not sure about the rest of you guys but the Notty will be prime this weekend.   I am going with a friend of mine who said the fishing has been awesome. Enjoy your time on the couch!
632752,asdve23rveavwa,2011-10-21 00:18:00,2690,"Yeah, was hoping to get out for the first time this weeekend...no way that is happening now.  Back to basement reno land."
632753,RickOnt,2011-10-21 00:38:00,669,"Hey Lew  You gotta get your line ""wet""!!  Gettin Out There is the best!!  Rick"
632756,Twocoda,2011-10-21 00:48:00,4130,  Caught crabs on a couch once....and i wasnt even trying
632771,wallacio,2011-10-21 02:28:00,475," Yeah, the Notty fishes great when there's been 40+mm of rain and it's a metre higher...let us know how you make out."
632793,misfish,2011-10-21 09:46:00,29133,  Thanks for wasting my morning coffee.LMAO
632804,12footspringbok,2011-10-21 11:47:00,459,I could have swore naming specific tributaries was a no no on this forum. Guess that only applies if they flow into lake O....
632812,MJL,2011-10-21 12:32:00,2427, He was referring to the Nottinghamshire region in England where the River Trent flows  For carp & barbel...
632815,lookinforwalleye,2011-10-21 12:43:00,4399,  Yes we have to keep that secret locked up!!!
632816,Mike Pike,2011-10-21 12:45:00,1332,"Now that's good comedy, that there is!"
632891,OutdoorDan,2011-10-21 16:42:00,325,I live less than a 10 minute drive from the credit and it looked especially scary yesterday.  Makes we wish I had a kayak (and a helmet).
632280,BillM,2011-10-19 13:33:00,17367,Here's your forecast  
632309,steverowbotham,2011-10-19 14:06:00,1800,Haha nice.
632319,tipupesox,2011-10-19 14:27:00,167,Hoping that by Sunday some of the WNY tribs are decent enough to get out.
632324,blaque,2011-10-19 14:41:00,2419, Same here.......i took off friday to try and explore a litte. Still hoping i can find some water to fish.....but not overly optimistic
632328,tipupesox,2011-10-19 15:01:00,167," You may want to try one of the Lake O tribs, I don't they received as much rain as down south."
632357,BillM,2011-10-19 16:05:00,17367," I fished a WNY trib on Sunday, it's usually low, gin clear and a trickle.  It was blown out pretty badly."
632390,cuzza,2011-10-19 17:37:00,467,"Have a trip with a guide booked for tomorrow - at this rate, I'll be at work"
632398,BillM,2011-10-19 17:52:00,17367," You better call him today and reschedule.    I dunno what system you're going to be on, but anything around here is going to be doubtful..."
632400,Harrison,2011-10-19 17:56:00,2202," What area Cuzza?  There is always somewhere fishable around here if it is not ""tropical strom"" bad."
632401,blaque,2011-10-19 17:58:00,2419," Ya, im guessing it'll be the Oak if anything."
632402,blaque,2011-10-19 18:01:00,2419, I heard......you guys were the victims of an inaccurate weatherman lol
632403,BillM,2011-10-19 18:02:00,17367," It was shaping up to be a good day, thinking we'd wait it out a few hours until it cleared..  Then the heavens opened up and we were shot the middle finger  That's steelheading for you"
632407,blaque,2011-10-19 18:10:00,2419," lol, Mom Nature...........she can be nasty"
632428,misfish,2011-10-19 19:01:00,29133,"Bill, quack."
632439,cuzza,2011-10-19 19:37:00,467," Pretty much anywhere in SW Ontario, Saugeen was the original plan. 50mm could play havoc with that though - the guy knows his stuff so I'm hoping he'll reschedule us if it's not worth the drive"
632452,torco,2011-10-19 20:33:00,656,So I shouldn't feel bad about working all weekend
632457,esoxansteel,2011-10-19 20:57:00,1307, Fish the DON river its always like that so the fish are used to it?
632482,ccmtcanada,2011-10-19 22:26:00,7971,Bill's tactic here is to spread the word.....then head out to tribs void of other anglers!  Oops....was I not supposed to tell that to everyone Bill?
632499,BillM,2011-10-19 23:24:00,17367," Cliff!!!   Don't be surprised if you wake up tomorrow to four flat tires, lol!!!!  Seriously though, we gotta get out again man!"
632500,Twocoda,2011-10-19 23:24:00,4130,unless something miraculous happens ....forget about the Saugeen....Bill chocolate milk pic is clear compared to whats going on in there right now...save the gas...
632504,MJL,2011-10-19 23:31:00,2427, So I don't need to resort to 2lb Fluoro this weekend  Good thing I'll have basketball-sized roe bags and Cliff to carry them all
632510,Roy,2011-10-19 23:38:00,13728," And ChrisK to chuck'em, and ChrisG to tell ChrisK where to chuck'em....Mike, your job is to fight them into Cliff's waiting net...wait, timeout! We need a cameraman!"
632511,BillM,2011-10-19 23:39:00,17367,I've got the camera!!
632512,Twocoda,2011-10-19 23:43:00,4130,you can always head a wee bit further up the coast Mike...if the Geen doesnt clear up...the weather has been spaced perfectly apart to keep the river blown out ...when we need a fix we have been hitting the harbour and chucking hardware..
632515,GBW,2011-10-19 23:48:00,8460,I DON'T want to know who is the tri-pod!
