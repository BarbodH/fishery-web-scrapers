634648,John Bacon,2011-10-27 01:59:00,3277,"Will you be there during a weekday? If so, drop by the MNR office and get a stocking list. Splake are a put and take fishery; of the lake isn't stocked then it doesn't have splake."
634665,OutdoorDan,2011-10-27 02:47:00,325,If you look hard enough you can also fine the odd stocking lists online.
634676,zeeter,2011-10-27 03:40:00,92,Like stated earlier the stocking map from the MNR on Hwy. 28 will help you the most.
634690,singingdog,2011-10-27 09:42:00,1047,Here you go: http://www.ontariostewardship.org/councils/bancroft/files/Stocking_List_2007_2010_final.pdf  Good luck. This is a great time of year for splake.
634785,adempsey,2011-10-27 15:36:00,1498,I found this online tool to be helpful in locating all those stocked lakes in Google Maps using the Easting and Northing coordinates they provide.  Good luck!
635128,lakemaster,2011-10-28 08:22:00,36, ohh nice thanks for the help
635129,lakemaster,2011-10-28 08:23:00,36, thanks bro i wish i catch one
635130,lakemaster,2011-10-28 08:24:00,36,Just wondering what does people use to catch splake?? and do they go in the deep water or you can fish them in the shoreline thanks
635138,singingdog,2011-10-28 09:55:00,1047,"At these water temps, I would fish them like brookies: cast to shoreline cover that has easy access to deep water. Steep dropoffs with large rocks are another spot to check out. If you have a FFinder, look for anyplace that has a slight rise in temps. With the sun in the forecast, the sun will heat up areas with dark bottom, logs, shallow rocks. I rarely fish deep for them this time of year, but I also get skunked occasionally."
