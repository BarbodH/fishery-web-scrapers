635307,Wade,2011-10-28 17:54:00,9,I have a Minn Kota MK-1-DC Onboard DC Alternator Battery Charger. It has a purple ignition wire that has to be connected to the ignition circuit - for a Johnson 40 HP VJ40ELET. I don't run anything from the ignition switch other than the starter so there are no accessories I could connect the purple wire to.  I checked the motor control but have no idea where to connect - lots of wires and connections - not sure what to try.  Any ideas?  Thanks
