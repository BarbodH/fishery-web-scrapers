635029,scottyswing,2011-10-28 00:18:00,37," The Simpsons Called It: Three Eyed Fish Caught Outside a Nuclear Power Plant    Fishermen in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina caught a three-eyed wolf fish in a reservoir fed by a local nuclear power plant, which will surely hinder the plant's owner's attempt to run for local office.  The fishermen say their discovery, which actually bears no resemblance to Blinky the three-eyed fish from The Simpsons, has begun to worry local residents who live near the reactor. And instead of feasting on their catch, and presumably gaining superpowers from its probable high levels of radiation, the men have decided to let it be tested to see if the mutation was actually a result of it being exposed to the water from the nuclear plant. After that they plan to have it embalmed for posterity, or sell it to Fox as a promotional item for their long running, and eerily prophetic, animated series. "
635169,Rod Caster,2011-10-28 12:41:00,5784,that's like the two mouthed goldeye caught in Lake Athabasca. Maybe it's part of evolution? Three eyes are surely better than two.

635353,Miracon,2011-10-28 19:47:00,200,It's almost as ugly as a Coelacanth!  
635378,OutdoorDan,2011-10-28 21:07:00,325, What?  Also mutations are not necessarily a result of whatever is happening at the plant.  Some species of fish are more prone to being mutated than others -- for example I've seen all kinds of weird pike come out of clean environments.
