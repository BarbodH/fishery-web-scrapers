635086,danbouck,2011-10-28 02:29:00,4380,"Thanks guys!    It took about 15 minutes to draw and 30 minutes to cut. I never have cooked up the seeds, maybe I'll try it next year."
635089,Grimace,2011-10-28 02:39:00,2020,"I love the seeds.  Cooked tastes great, or eat them raw and they are very good for you."

635182,skeeter,2011-10-28 13:09:00,1907,"Cook the seeds!! Wash them off, then lay them out on a cookie sheet. Coat them with garlic salt, when they start to turn brown flip them over with a spatula coat again with garlic salt. When that side starts to turn brown, they are done. Let them cool off , then fill up large zip lock bags with them and courier them off to me!!"
635185,Roy,2011-10-28 13:15:00,13728,"That's a great job, Dan. Fishing related too!"

635341,misfish,2011-10-28 19:04:00,29133,Very nice art work there Dan.  As for the seeds. Roasted in the oven with roasted garlic and pepper spice. I do this with plain almonds aswell.
635346,manitoubass2,2011-10-28 19:19:00,11391,"My pumpkin this year was of the G. Loomis fish logo. Last weekend the kids and I had a blast carving pumkins! It was my first time in years, and I'm glad I joined in this year.  The kitchen was one heck of a mess though.  We put our seeds on a tray, coated with a little oil, seasoning salt, garlic salt, onion salt and a little pepper. Cooked on 350 for about 35 minutes, and turned at the half way point. Turned out darn tasty, but I barely got any because of the kids chowing them down!  The pumpkin was too small, so the pic sucks, lol  "
