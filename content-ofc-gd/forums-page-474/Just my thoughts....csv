634593,Handlebarz,2011-10-26 23:20:00,3790,I would think this place would fall like many other boards if it was changed I dont post on may other sites and have stopped looking at many of them due to to many sections. I liked some of the ice fishing sites but they have WAY to many sections I loose interest. My vote (even thought were not voting) is to leave it as it has always been

Like I said....simple  The format has worked since the boards inception...and IMO its as good as its always been.

634988,aplumma,2011-10-27 22:39:00,6896, Yes Paul we all have the same access to the controls and the ability to stop a situation if it pops up till we can discuss the actions. That discussion occurs in the secret room were we leave messages back and forth till we form a consensus. Their is a lot of discussions and planning done to keep this place going and the time spent here is donated to the community by all of the Mod's/admin..   Art

I have been around since year 2 or 3 and don't post as much as others but I am on here every day and read what I want and don't read what doesn't interest me. I also don't get involved with threads that are obviously destined for the pooper...Yes, I have opinions and thoughts on 'most everything but there are those among us that choose to get involved in a topic simply to stir things up and see what happens. Life is too short guys and gals, if you want to get involved in heated debates there are forums where all y'all would be right at home! Just sayin'......"
634389,wallyboss,2011-10-26 15:47:00,1095,It's not because Non-fishing posts would be in a different section that you won't have any bickering.

634429,adolson,2011-10-26 17:36:00,783," It is a little odd (to me) that there's a section just for photos, and a section just for computer help, but not a section just for fishing on a fishing forum. And why not just put the photos and computer help, etc, in with the rest?"
634434,smally21,2011-10-26 17:55:00,993,"i like kicking frogs analogy -for me a locked post is a safe post!  dan you are right guys dont need to get their shorts in a knot. (or ""I"" dont need to get my shorts in a knot). your posts are never offensive ( i may have stepped in for you once on another site..)  to me there is something very condescending about the introduction into a post, the suggestion ""give it up guys"" or ""just go fishing"" or ""here is winternet"". if it doesn't concern you, then why bud in. would you walk up to a bunch of guys sitting at the bar, stroll up to their table and tell them to knock it off? just because you are not interested - or more likely, its not about you? you might if they were childern, but we are not children."
634436,Miracon,2011-10-26 17:56:00,200,"Here's a newbie perspective on it. I am new to fishing (started at the end of this summer ) and to this forum. I originally came here looking for advice on where to go fishing and received more help then I could ever have imagined! And I posted my reports. But because of the people on here (and people are what make a forum!), I am hooked and love to spend a small part of my spare time reading through posts. A lot of what I read is to learn more about fishing so I am better prepared for the spring.  However, I also want to become a MEMBER here, not just a newbie looking for advice. And not just someone who posts when they only need help. Because I can't yet give advice on fishing (except maybe how NOT to catch anything! ), the only other way for people to get to know me is if there are other topics I may be able to participate in or even start.  I am an active member in 2 other forums for business purposes. In those forums you get eaten alive!! All posts have to be on topic but when you ask a question, it could be jumped all over and when you give advice, it can be jumped all over! I am certain a lot of fear stops people from posting altogether which is counter-productive to the forum's purpose.  It was with great pleasure I found OFC and everyone here and it's nice to have found an awesome combination of a great fishing resource and an exciting place to hang out. In the short time I have been here, I have laughed at posts, shed a tear at posts, and above all, learned more about fishing!  So a great job to the mods and members of OFC for making this place exactly what a forum should be!  Michelle"

634574,Dutch,2011-10-26 22:36:00,831,"I belong to a number of other boards, all of which have separate sections for differing topics.  There has always been resistance in this forum to having a separate area fr NF posts.  I don't know whether it is the nostalgia of days gone by when there was only one area to make posts or what.  But, the Board has grown, the members have changed.  Many of the long-long term members, going back to the 'old' board don't want to rock the boat and have separate forums for NF posts, to a large extent (IMO) due to respect for the Board creators.  The board was created this way for a reason, no one wants to rock the boat and offend the inventor.  One way to gauge opinion would be to start a poll with 2 choices - separate section or no separate section, simple.  If the Board owner(s) are interested or considering having a separate section a poll would be a great thing for them the start.  If not, life goes on and we can all skip whatever threads we want on our own."
634577,ChrisK,2011-10-26 22:47:00,2772,This is the way our board is and its not going to change....We like it this way
634579,scugpg,2011-10-26 22:48:00,1373, It would be interesting to see what the poll would say....let the community decide
634590,Big Cliff,2011-10-26 23:11:00,6899,"The topic of seperate sections has been debated so many times over the years on this board and it always comes back to the same thing. LEAVE IT AS IT IS because it works!  No other fishing board has shown the sustained growth that this board has. If I put a post up here saying ""I need help with""; plumbing, electrical, appliance repair, automotive repair, or almost any other topic you want to consider someone is going to get back to me usually within an hour or two with information and help that I need. Even if they don't have the answer to my question, they can very often offer sources where I can find the answer.  So if you want a fishing only section just go to a fishing only board or just skip the NF posts, it's as simple as that!"
634591,Moosebunk,2011-10-26 23:13:00,3970,"With a huge appetite for all things fishing that makes me a participant with a good number of boards, this wouldn't be OFC if it was the same as any other.  Always liked the single page format, and especially do now because of slower internet speed at home.  One page to load, and from there go to whatever topics interest you.  The Non-Fishing stuff.......................... I'll be honest, it's ""a little"" too much ""at times.""  I do understand there are many members that use this forum to stay in touch and discuss different things day-to-day as friends.  It is afterall, a community, and one with history.  There are many positive NF threads that could be considered necessary and great, but sometimes... these and negative NF topics really do overshadow the fact this is a ""fishing"" website first.  A ""fishing"" website with the largest amount of angler members and traffic for this region.  With that, I would think OFC would have the greatest amount of fishing content to discuss and also, report.  There are times when that doesn't seem to be the case, or, NF topics congest what many people come here seeking first, fishing.  Many of the negative NF topics depress the general mood of some members as well, making the place less palatable to others at times.  If more time was spent, creating, reading, contributing and responding to fishing related topics because NF topics were fewer and out of mind........... I dunno... I'd guess probably somedays, that would make the place happier overall.  Personally, I like the site and always have.  Most do!!!  Sometimes NF topics that didn't seemingly have any place being here to begin with, cause a stir.  Nothing is perfect, so if I had one wish for OFC, it would simply be for more fishing.... cause that's something we're all usually glad to read and discuss."
634272,lew,2011-10-26 10:30:00,12766,"When TJ started this board many years ago he decided not to have seperate pages for non-fishing topics. He liked the idea of having everything on one page.  I've been a member of this board going on 10 years now and in that time this website has had several facelifts and even 2 or 3 name changes but it usually got better and now we have something like 7500 members.  There's always been different folks over the years who have suggested that we have seperate pages for fishing & non-fishing but the powers that be have no intention of changing it.  A rule came into effect several years ago stating that we'll put NF in the title of any thread that isn't about fishing and that way, if your not interested in it, you'll be able to avoid it by not reading it.  Problem is though, people will still read the thread, then start complaining about it because it's not fishing related, even though the title probably indicated just that. Next thing you know, a couple more folks jump on the bandwagon and before you know it, the post has gone completely off topic, down the tube and locked up.  What's interesting to me may not be interesting to you and visa versa. If you don't find a thread interesting, why not just close the post and move onto something else, rather than ruining it for those that are taking part in the thread and enjoying it ??  I have absolutely ZERO interest in some of the stuff posted around here but when I see those subjects I just move onto something more to my liking.  Worst part is guys who post non-fishing things, then complain when somebody else does the exact same thing.  We currently have a music thread with around 1000 replies, there's always talk of hockey and car racing, how do I fix my fridge, my air conditioner is broke,  guys posting that they need a job, do you agree with seat belts, raising $$$ to help a member and just about every other topic you can think about.  Always lots of non-fishing stuff to read, or not read.  If you enjoy it, that's good, but if you don't enjoy the topic, why not just move on and not ruin it for those that DO enjoy it  But that's all just my opinion."
