634876,Beans,2011-10-27 19:27:00,3339,The dairy in town wouldn't sell me a big tub of ice cream this year so that I could give each of some mother's children a big scoop in their trick or treat bag...  Damn the luck...always someone to spoil our fun...
634880,ketchenany,2011-10-27 19:36:00,3229,"Beans put a note in the bag with the ""Dairy's"" name on it and why they let the kids down!  that should increase sales . . ."
634893,Big Cliff,2011-10-27 19:53:00,6899,"Oh come on Beans, the reason the dairy wouldn't sell you a big tub of icecream is because you tried to take back what you had left over. Besides, you scared the kids so bad last year there won't be any knocking at your door this year, I warned you last year to put on a mask or they wouldn't come back!"
634901,aplumma,2011-10-27 20:12:00,6896,I usually hand out fishing sinkers and dead batteries it's dark and they make a real satisfying thunk when you pop them into the bag.   Art

634975,OutdoorDan,2011-10-27 22:25:00,325," Well, in my trick or treating days I would have much rather got some fishing sinkers than the occasional pennies some old ladies would throw in..."

635153,mercman,2011-10-28 11:44:00,7054,  Art !!! Good one
635157,lew,2011-10-28 12:06:00,12766," That's the way I used to  get rid of all the pennies cluttering up the house every year. A bucket full is worth nothing and it's too much aggrevation to roll them for the few $$$$ you get back.  Dump a hand full in every bag, I got rid of the junk and the kids thought they hit the jackpot  Trouble is now though, there's no kids around here and the penny pails are starting to fill up again"
635163,Roy,2011-10-28 12:31:00,13728,And we can't even call them coppers anymore as they're 94% steel.
635188,ketchenany,2011-10-28 13:31:00,3229," NOW you tell me! I have more that 11,000 in a bucket! Used to have them in a bottlte until I picked it up and the bottom fell out!"
