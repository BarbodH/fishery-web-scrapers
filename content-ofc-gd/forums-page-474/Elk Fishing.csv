635196,bassmaster4,2011-10-28 13:57:00,801,wouldnt wanna get too close to those things look at the size of those antlers! in pic #2 is that guy all wrapped up in the elks antlers?
635201,Pikeslayer8,2011-10-28 14:15:00,336," The pics. were taken in Estes Park and yes his flyline was tangled up in his rack.  The elk there are almost domesticated, no fear of humans.   One of the pictures was on the frount page of the Denver Post.  The man is a pastor from Texas.  I just thought it was cool and the good people on OFC might enjoy something a little different."
