634756,bigbuck,2011-10-27 14:29:00,2449,"You go up to Northern Ontario and west of our province and you will find that most firearm owners DID NOT REGISTER all of their firearms. It was a huge boondoggle that cost us over $1billion, I believe the original number we were given was $11million. Just a bit of a difference. Like E-Health.  I'm no redneck but long guns here esp. in the north are very common and useful tools for feeding your family. Handguns are a different story, other than some .22s used for target shooting, most handguns out there are designed with one thing in mind, KILLING PEOPLE. Handguns are strictly controlled, there are quite a few hoops involved with getting an RPAL as there should be. The licensing system does what it is supposed to, have some control over who gets legal access to firearms and ammunition, though up north, they don't tend to ask for your PAL when you go to a nameless big box store to buy a brick of .22 for plinking.  Police like the control factor in knowing who exactly is a legal gun owner. I can understand to an extent that they love the registry esp. when serving a warrant or going into a domestic dispute. Unfortunately, Police abuse their powers when they get them, ie G20, what a friggin' mess. It is a slippery slope when giving police a lot of power, they get too much, you can end up with a Police State that is paranoid and everyone gets their papers checked multiple times per day. I have an aunt who lives in Russia (long story), she could not believe that when she was here that the police left you alone (in the mid '80s before the end of the Cold War). This is why we have a system that has a few checks and balances. The Long Gun registry was created as a knee jerk reaction to the killings in Montreal and other occurences elsewhere. It did absolutely nothing but trample on innocent people's civil rights. How many criminals out there did the right thing and went to register their illegally obtained weapons???? I'd love to see that number. We talk a lot here about the US and the amount of weaponry there is available down there, we have to realize that The Right To Bear Arms is yet another check and balance for the government. The USA was born out of revolution and it recognizes that the government could be overthrown at any time by the citizenry.  I can rant on for days on this issue, thankfully stick a fork in the registry, it is just about done."

634287,jedimaster,2011-10-26 12:23:00,3472,"Its amazing who is creeping out of the woodwork now. I have never known any police officer to be told to be more or less cautious based on a search of the registry. Also I though all related search information was to be destroyed? Seems like the windsor police will be saving it.  Windsor Police Services Chief Gary Smith said the registry assisted police officers, particularly when responding to domestic calls.  “I don’t want to overdramatize it, but it can save lives,” said Smith. ”Often we would search a registry before we dispatched an officer on a call and if you tell them there’s a firearm registered, they’re a little cautious, depending on the type of call. My detectives would use it quite often, anytime they applied for a search warrant or an arrest warrant.”  He laid the blame for the demise of the registry in part on law-enforcement officials. “There was a lot of misinformation out there,” said Smith. “We, as a police community, didn’t explain it to the public properly.”  Police forces will have to adapt to working without the registry, although they still have access to past records, said Smith.  “It’s one of those things,” he said. “We’re going to have to learn to adapt and live with the consequences of that.”"

634290,ricoboxing,2011-10-26 12:33:00,398,"So I guess when they get word that there are no registered firearms in the house, they don't have to be as cautious because it is well known that criminals and drug dealers all register their guns. They also store them legally too."
634293,fishindevil,2011-10-26 12:50:00,6254,ricoboxing you said it man !!! after all it was the hunters and thier guns that were killing all those innocent people not the drug dealers and criminals !!!! too funny
634297,Grimace,2011-10-26 13:02:00,2020, So they will prepare to use more force because somebody registered their guns legally under the old system?  They should wipe out the old records and treat every case on it's own merits.  Even if that takes *Gasp* some actual police work.

634449,LucG,2011-10-26 18:17:00,779," lol...Not only is it one less burden, but think about how much money it was burning. I read somewhere just a few days ago, (might have even been on here) that the gov't was spending 100x times more than what it said it was going to cost when it was first established."

634476,esoxansteel,2011-10-26 19:10:00,1307,"Re the Registry, police when responding to domestics, drug houses etc, should always assume their weapons involved, and should act accordingly, they shouldnt rely on the gun registry to make the call for them, criminals do NOT register their guns, and stolen guns which may have been registered soon have the serial numbers filed, what a waste of money,"
634490,jimmer,2011-10-26 19:35:00,2730,I am still waiting to hear of one scenario where the gun registry actually prevented a death. I would think that it would have been all over the media if there was one. Won't be sad to see it go. Don't give them any ideas West Arm Rider!

634548,blarg,2011-10-26 21:30:00,289,"Actually the new hits per day number is now 17,000, thats only a three fold increase in 5 years, accounting for about 1 in every 4 police officers checking on a registered gun owner everyday, when you consider the number of officers that arent actually investigating but pushing paper the number becaomes even more ridiculous.  Of course anyone with any sense and desire to educate themselves on the issue knows that the 17,000 number results from an interconnected system that checks all the police databases during say traffic stops etc.  Btw, do a little math, 365x17,000=6,205,000 hits a year, according to every report I have seen, about half, or 7 million firearms in this country have been registered, so on average there are enough hits on the registry to check on 89 percent of all registered firearms in this country each year and climbing, meanwhile legal long guns account for about 5 percent of homicides and registered long guns about 3 percent.  Police chiefs are politicians, believe what you wish but the numbers are pretty clear, they are lying to you, trying to use you, and some of you are letting them.  These are the same people who make an up organization that was against the charter of rights and who abused protestors during the g20, if they could get the right to enter your home without a warrant or wiretap you phone they would take that too, would you agree with them there as well?  The licensing system is all the information they need, it is pretty reasonable to assume that if you have a PAL you probably have a gun."

634652,jedimaster,2011-10-27 02:12:00,3472,17000 registry checks per day. I wonder how many traffic tickets are issued every day.
