635215,adolson,2011-10-28 14:56:00,783,Brooklin is pretty far away.. I can get to North Bay... and plan to!
634507,Remastered,2011-10-26 20:11:00,143,I've walked on 2 inches of river ice. So basically even if your highly overweight I'd say you could still fish on 4 inches no prob.
634511,NAW,2011-10-26 20:16:00,4022, I like ice fishing with guys like you.  Send em out first.  If he can make it must be ok for me!
634512,DRIFTER_016,2011-10-26 20:16:00,10439,I fish more in winter than summer. But that is due to our extended winter season here in the land North of 60*.
634513,adolson,2011-10-26 20:17:00,783," I need a sled too?! I'll never afford this!  (the fat part. lost over 30lbs so far this year.. not sure exactly how much because my scale just said ERR2 when I'd stand on it, so I really don't know where I started, just when my weight started showing back up on the screen.. lol.)"
634514,NAW,2011-10-26 20:17:00,4022, Or if you're me.  Pull start the sled..  Pull start the augar.  Twist the cap off the thermos..  Set to rods up real close so you don't have to run anywhere..
634517,NAW,2011-10-26 20:19:00,4022, That's what a floater suit is for
634520,misfish,2011-10-26 20:20:00,29133, Im not fishing with you Nick.
634525,NAW,2011-10-26 20:24:00,4022,   This is my float suite!  
634540,crappieperchhunter,2011-10-26 21:11:00,2582, I look forward to getting out with you this winter Brian. Perch or Whities/Lakers....doesn't matter to me.  We will just have to get it done this year.  BTW I don't think Apple makes the shuffle anymore. But the Nano's are awesome.plus they tell time and are able to get FM radio as well. I already asked Santa for one.
634547,misfish,2011-10-26 21:29:00,29133,"  Nick,what are you doing?  Photoshop man.   No worries,it will happen.  Do they still sell transistor radios?"
634549,NAW,2011-10-26 21:32:00,4022," Don't worry Brian.  My much heavier (at the time) fishing partner stood there first to make sure it was safe ice!  In all seriousness, I am actually very safe on the ice.."
634584,Jer,2011-10-26 23:04:00,1426,"Since they've opened up a year round pan-fish season in the Kawarthas, I've ice fished more than ever before. For years we would make one or two trips a year to Nipissing or Simcoe. The last two years I've fished more hardwater locally than the previous 15 years put together."
634602,Moosebunk,2011-10-26 23:33:00,3970,"If there were 6 months of ice to go along with 6 months of no ice... then I'd fish them about equal.  This years ice season will be less than usual, it's been planned that way for a couple of reasons."
634781,GBW,2011-10-27 15:24:00,8460,"Hey Dana, just keep this in mind...  "
634800,Roy,2011-10-27 16:08:00,13728," Remember, there's no such thing as ""safe ice"". Charts are just a guide under ideal conditions."
634803,motion,2011-10-27 16:14:00,403,Thats very true Roy. Pressure cracks and overall conditions can and do change quickly. Play safe out there guys!
634804,livinisfishin,2011-10-27 16:18:00,661, This right here is what its about for me...and of course catching the fish! I love it when you can't keep up between bites getting to the point where you are outta breath.
634837,Jds63,2011-10-27 18:05:00,1365," Dana, your'e hilarious, i like your writing style and sense of humour dude."
634924,adolson,2011-10-27 20:55:00,783,"The problem I see with measuring ice thickness is that if it's too thin, it's probably gonna be too late.  I will probably play it very safe and wait for the cars to get on the ice first, and then I'll go.   Haha, thanks. You might like"
634954,GBW,2011-10-27 21:49:00,8460,"Dana, when I go to my folks place on a lake I bring a fully charged cordless drill with me, a rather large bit and a tape measure.  make sure the tape can get in the hole to see how thick it is and just inch out bit by bit.  you will almost always hear the lake make sounds that might freak you out but most of the time it's the lake making more ice and air trying to get out."
634961,NAW,2011-10-27 22:01:00,4022,"My advice Dana.  Find a seasoned ice fishing vet, and go out with them for a season.  For the first year, I never went on the ice alone.  The guy that I fish with has been fishing Simcoe for almost 50 years.  I've learned so much about ice safety from fishing with him."
634981,misfish,2011-10-27 22:33:00,29133,"  Wheres Chevy when ya need him.  He can tell ya personally,that safe ice,is not always safe ice. Glad he,s around to tell us this. (wish I could find his post)  Same area two weeks later,there were people every where. Both Terry and I, seen a guy go in,even though he was following a walked path."
635027,adolson,2011-10-28 00:12:00,783,"Yeah, that's good advice, and considering I don't own anything, not an auger, not winter clothing, no float suit, no sled, not even a long drill bit (though I do own a bag of potatoes - Sinclair will have to give me more details on how to use these for safety purposes), I'll probably have no choice but to go with someone who has at least some of that stuff. I know a few people who have plans to take me out on the ice, and my cousin and best friend both have ice fished and are interested too. I'm not sure if I'll find an actual ice fishing pro around me, but I definitely don't plan to go alone yet."
635084,NAW,2011-10-28 02:27:00,4022,"If Blair hosts another Nippissing G2G this winter, you should go.  Good fun on the ice."
635104,GBW,2011-10-28 03:34:00,8460,"Dana (Dude) then feel free to HEAD SOUTH and PM me or Sinclair and either one of us can and or will take you out.  Hell, I'll even throw in a tarp to keep you warm and dry if you don't have anything.      That, and I have the rod's, reels, lures and stuff (hutt too) so you just need to show up! (if you can get here) to go fishing.  Heck, we may even trick young_one or others to come out fishing too, lol!"
634374,limeyangler,2011-10-26 15:05:00,5204, Very well put sir!  LOL..especially not missing peeing out of the boat!
634376,ccmtcanada,2011-10-26 15:08:00,7971,"I still haven't caught the ice fishing bug...as hard as I try to, I just can't.  I'd MUCH rather be standing in a river, the shore, or in a boat.  Maybe it's because I hate snow and cold??? LOL.  That said, ice fishing for me is more about being with friends and having a good time.  I'd fish solo on softwater, but never on the ice."
634384,NAW,2011-10-26 15:32:00,4022,"I only started ice fishing about 5 years ago.  Before that I never steped foot on the ice.  To tell you the truth, the worse the weather, the more I like it.  To me, there's nothing beter then sitting in -35Â°c in heavy winds and zero visiblity jigging a few km from shore for white fish.  It is nice to fish from a hut from time to time though"
634391,adolson,2011-10-26 16:12:00,783," I'd like to know that logic... ""Sit on ice and be bored"" = real fisherman?"
634395,mercman,2011-10-26 16:17:00,7054, Not all of us are ''built'' for Peeing off the boat. I prefer to use a recipeeint.
634396,Billy Bob,2011-10-26 16:25:00,5865,When I was younger I ice fished in the bare bone outdoors......but 30 years of working outside in subzero weather during all times of the day and night has weaned me off of ice fishing....not to say it wouldn't happen again but for now all my ice is in my rum&coke glass...
634398,Terry,2011-10-26 16:26:00,14456,"I enjoy ice fishing I never have to worry about it getting so hot I don't feel like sitting in a boat, which happens in the summer but OFC get so much wintetnet/ cabin fever Disney made a cartoon about it  <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvid25.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fc52%2FMrbeee1954%2FVideos%2Fofnfever.mp4"">"
634400,Rod Caster,2011-10-26 16:28:00,5784, Is it any worse than sitting on your concrete foam seat in your sportspal not catching brook trout? The day I get bored of any kind of fishing is the day I order a lobotomy haha.
634401,Harrison,2011-10-26 16:32:00,2202," Guys who have ice fished with me know I never bored, I just start making swiss cheese."
634411,manitoubass2,2011-10-26 16:56:00,11391,"I love both, and I probably ice fish as much as I hit the softwater in a boat or from shore. In the hardwater season, I really enjoy that feeling of being outdoors in the middle of nowhere. The scenery is a major plus for me. One thing I don't have in the winter though is patience, I'm apt to drill 20 holes an hour looking for that immediate bite, lol.  That being said, I had some close calls last year on the Rainy River that have me thinking about slowing down this winter, and only fishing smaller lakes."
634414,adolson,2011-10-26 16:59:00,783," Well, we can't all find old boat seats in the trash."
634415,craigdritchie,2011-10-26 16:59:00,1586,Ice fishing?  I'd rather have a barbed wire enema.
634424,hendrix,2011-10-26 17:28:00,61,"no boat so i can't wait for the ice. walk for 45 minutes in a field of snow, drill a hole in the floor and catch a fish"
634435,manitoubass2,2011-10-26 17:56:00,11391,"   I hand drill, so at least it keeps me warm, lol.  "
634445,Rod Caster,2011-10-26 18:12:00,5784," Hey, you don't find if you don't rummage. I just might use it on the ice as well."
634450,Jds63,2011-10-26 18:18:00,1365,ice fishing is an addiction .... an addiction I tell ya
634455,lew,2011-10-26 18:22:00,12766,"  Hey Phil, I remember one weekend you and me were up north and we were hoping the daytime temps would RISE to -30"
634462,misfish,2011-10-26 18:37:00,29133, I thought you didnt ice fish Lew.   Looking forward to this hard water season.
634473,adolson,2011-10-26 19:01:00,783,"I love how nobody voted in the poll that they only fish on ice. Might be a reason for that!  In all seriousness, I'm really looking forward to trying it out again. I wish I had a snowmobile though, so I could get to some lakes I want to try where there are likely no roads plowed (they don't maintain them in the summer, so I doubt winter will be any different). It'll be a long time before I can afford that, since I don't even own winter boots. I'm starting basically from scratch here. The only ice fishing gear I already own is hooks, and even those are probably a special summer-only kind.   I was thinking that exact thought. I really gotta get my hands on one or two of them. Guess I'll start with a trip to the dump."
634479,kickingfrog,2011-10-26 19:15:00,8333,"I ice fish because it is just about the only option for 3-4 months of the year where I live. I prefer soft water, not because of the warmer weather, but because casting for fish is my preferred way to spend my time between catching fish.  Part of winternet isn't the lack of fishing, but the lack of other activities/chores such as cutting the grass, washing the car etc."
634484,Familyfisherman,2011-10-26 19:26:00,188,"I do both.  Ice fishing I find is a great way to get people who don't fish out.  There's less to mess up   They use my stuff, I show them how...then they sit there and watch me catch fish...it's great!  Of course I have noticed most people only come with me once for some reason...dah well."
634498,crappieperchhunter,2011-10-26 19:57:00,2582,I love the ice   If it came down to only one type of fishing...I honestly think I would choose ice fishing. I am perfectly happy wandering out on my own for a day on the ice. I do not enjoy going out in my boat alone...much rather have company for that.  Bundled up in my Fish Trap...with my ipod shuffle playing some of my favourite tunes while I haul in fish. That's what I'm waiting for
634502,misfish,2011-10-26 20:04:00,29133,  I havent forgot I owe you Steve.  I got to get me one of them ipods.For those slow days.
634503,adolson,2011-10-26 20:05:00,783," Nah, not afraid - I welcome it. I tried it before and really didn't like it, but things are different now. Tastes change. I'm older, married, more mature, I like asparagus (still don't like brussels sprouts though), so maybe it'll be something I enjoy now. If it can help feed my fishing addiction through the miserable months, then I'm DTF (down to fish) in the winter.  Of course, being so fat I worry about the ice breaking, but I'm slowly working on that."
634504,misfish,2011-10-26 20:10:00,29133, Mush them in yer taters with katsup.Never know they were there.
634294,NAW,2011-10-26 12:52:00,4022,"Be easy on me.  This is my first Poll.  I'm sure it's been done before, just not that I can remember.  With all of the NF posts as of late, I thought a little fishing related poll might be refreshing to some.  The concept of ""Winternet"" has never really set in to my brain.  I'm one of those guys who likes the winter more then the summer.  I Ice fish every weekend, both Saturday, and Sunday if my wife allows it.  I fish much more during the hard water season then I do in the soft water.  And definitely spend less time in front of the computer.  I have always wondered what % of OFNers hit the ice during the hard water season?"
634300,johnnyb,2011-10-26 13:08:00,3413,"I try to fish as much as possible during the winter...realistically probably fish more during the summer just due to opportunity.  However if your poll had an option for fishing the same winter or summer, I'd choose that."
634303,Leecher,2011-10-26 13:12:00,7832,"Ice fishing is one of my favorite pass time that I enjoy during winter    Since up here, I can use 5 lines and also can access fishing grounds that are not accessible during softwater being shore bound.  Also no bugs    Like you, my weekends are reserved for that"
634304,GBW,2011-10-26 13:13:00,8460,I have to say it's equal for me.
634305,lew,2011-10-26 13:14:00,12766,"I have zero interest in ice fishing, never do it, and use the winter months for other things."
634307,Rizzo,2011-10-26 13:16:00,4754,"I get out more frequently in the winter, but for shorter periods of time. I don't fish Simcoe at all from boat, but its hard to turn down ice fishing 15 minutes from home! I'll take off on a Saturday morning, can fish for a few hours and still be home by noon to help the wife out. Hard to do the same when you're dragging a boat out to the Kawarthas and back"
634308,NAW,2011-10-26 13:16:00,4022, I didn't think of that.  Poll has been edited with that option added.
634309,mike rousseau,2011-10-26 13:17:00,4661,well fishing is like heroin for me....  so to go all winter without fishing would be pretty rough...  i wish i could fish open water year round... but i cant...  so i ice fish... and every year i think about selling all my ice gear...  kepp in mind the water i fish is the st.lawrence river... serious lack of safe ice on the river... serious lack of spots to fish....
634311,Twocoda,2011-10-26 13:20:00,4130,I fish all winter ....but its soft water...the trick is to find some open water..
634312,BillM,2011-10-26 13:22:00,17367,I fish both softwater and hardwater in the winter   Icefishing is a nice break from steelheading.
634314,strik,2011-10-26 13:28:00,175,i try to get out as much as i can.  I  have been looking at the ice gear  and started up the auger.  Just  need to decide what new rod to get this year.  Hopefully were on the ice by Dec 22  Take care  
634318,Spiel,2011-10-26 13:36:00,9065, I love ice fishing for steelies.
634324,adempsey,2011-10-26 13:52:00,1498,"I only ice fish more because I don't own a boat, it's cheaper and it's a lot easier to get out there and fish."

634338,limeyangler,2011-10-26 14:20:00,5204,Equal.  Love the boat...love the snowmachine.  Love the lakes i can get into in the winter that are not accessible by boat.   ICE WAS ON THE CREEK YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.........BRING IT ON....FAST PLEASE!
634341,Rod Caster,2011-10-26 14:23:00,5784,"I used to prefer ice fishing because it gave me more access to waters. Now that I have a proper canoe setup, I'm probably closer to 50/50. Ice fishing is so much easier imo, drive/walk out, drill holes, enjoy day! Can't wait a certain pair of new tipups to knock at my door!"
