After the base yellow I layered quail feathers  onto this one to give it the scaled effect. Came out amazing but definately too much work. Here's a few more shots of it.           This one was for another friend of mine down here. Its a  strait up popper. It was about 5-6 inches if l remember correctly. Weighed in at just over 2oz.        A closer look at the scale patern l did.       Did a bunch of these as well for friends. Hand-carved balsa wood with spinners for feet.            Got a bunch more done, just gotta find those ole pics... time to fire up the ole 'puter   FHR"

634848,Spiel,2011-10-27 18:35:00,9065, They are easy to tie Bill (perfection is not needed) and if I can help you get set up let me know.
634857,BillM,2011-10-27 18:48:00,17367,  Right on man!  Only thing I'm unsure about is the paint for the jighead itself (and maybe the small stick on eyes)  I've got most of the tying materials (Or can pickup whatever I need in the city)..  It's the paint that's got me confused.

Here's my first attempt at making my first wood reel seat for a float rod (I know it's not bait/lure making, but it is totally fishing related).

629145,Handlebarz,2011-10-09 15:51:00,3790,"I have always messed around with different lures for what ever I fished for flies for the trout, Harnesses for eyes, Poppers for bass, so when I got into musky fishing it was just a given that I would start at some point making something.  I first started with the store bought spinner bait heads I got them painted by Outlaw he also did the blades for me they were done with Bucktail here are a couple of them from the winter of 2005 into 2006.     I then thought I would makes some in lines from bucktail     well naturally any musky hunter needs some marabou and feathers so I did them for a bit      Well from there flashabou was the next step for me and it was the big craze in the musky world so I started with them and I can tell you it was not easy at first I would have much rather tied bucktail or marabou back then. here are some of my first flashabou tie jobs and ideas.  This one has a 6oz weight in front of the flashabou with two very heavy magnum Indiana blades but the weight was to heavy for these blades to pull it to my liking.   This was my second ever flashabou tied and fished it looked OK in the water but I need to improve a lot.   Not sure where in the learning curve this was but I was getting happier with them   The second ever copper walleye I made I was not cutting the flashabou to my lining yet but it worked out great   I still had some unpainted spinner bait heads left so I brought them to outlaw for a paint job and I added flashabou to them (I still have some left I will be adding flashabou to and selling  later)    I relay liked how this one turned out other then the blades they were done with powder paint by me and were not to my liking    I then had a idea of using my inline sinker mold to make my own style spinner baits (the first Egg Head) it worked out great but I knew it needed some tweaking and put it off until 2011   I had another version of the inline weights this was much better but I needed bigger blades   In 2009 I was very happy with the way my flashabou was so I started to concentrate on it and made a bunch of different sizes here are some of the first ones of the soon to be Handlebarz line  double 8's   first of the double 10's   I was still messing around with blades like this double 8 Indiana but it did not give me the flair that the baits needed    well here comes the 2010 musky season and I am getting bugged (in a good way) by a couple friends about me selling my lures to some stores I did not think it would go but I gave it a try in a couple with just the double 8's and sure enough they were selling I was so happy but the stores started to ask for double 10's I had only been making them for my self and a couple friends at that point but knew they were ready for the market so this year I released them here on OFC and was very excited with the response that everyone gave me they have been a great hit and been putting alot of musky in the boats for many musky hunters (I still need pictures from you guys who are using them) here are the finished double 8's and 10's  double 8 lemon lime   double 10 fire tiger with outlaw painted blades   Here is the end of my journey its the night before 2011 opener I have Ron (Djeep) stops over at 10pm to get some used lures I have for sale and notices my first home made spinner bait and asked if I was still making them ???? I get thinking about redoing them (I had been thinking of them for a few years) well I get to work again and am finnaly happy with the Egg Heads to start to sell them if it were not for Ron asking me I dont know If I would have gotten to them this year or not but thanks Ron     Thanks for this thread Roy I had wanted to post how my business has evolved but did not know how to start a thread about it. Thanks for all the support from the OFC family it has been alot of fun turning this hobby into what it is today."
629169,Roy,2011-10-09 16:58:00,13728,"Lew, good stuff. I was noticing...do you 'TEE' all of your forward trebles? Also, is that a Weagle I see there?  George, your Woodies need no introduction. They're well known, in fact just last week I was looking at them on Stacey's site. Very nice stuff.  Larry, I've seen your baits before somewhere but I can't for the life of me remember where. At that time I didn't know you made baits and was blown away when I saw them.  Mike, what can I say...very nice history and product progression. I have some of your baits but have yet to use them.(I haven't gotten out this season hardly at all.) I certainly will soon and report to you.    One of my sayings is, and it specifically applies to baits: ""You can never say a bait is bad until it has worked at least once."""

629185,lew,2011-10-09 17:45:00,12766," Not a Weagle Roy, but a Doc, one of Pete Mainas baits and an excellent topwater.  And yes, I do TEE all my center and front hooks. It saves alot of wear & tear on the lures but I find it also ups the hooking percentage.  On my triple hook twitch baits, like that Double ""D"", I remove the center hook entirely and up the front hook a couple sizes too. Gives the bait a better action and also improves the neutral buoyancy while still hooking very well.  I always enjoy tweaking baits to improve them."

The first time I saw some of yours I was speechless. I mean, the realism is out of this world. Even if you did post some of them before, I'm sure we all don't mind seeing them again and again. Great stuff!  Mike, no, I don't see a need for through-wire on those particular baits. If they were plastic, rubber or balsa then yes, they'd be through-wired. I'm even moving away from screw eyes. There's a better way."

Whether you make your own baits or not . Whether they be large or small, wood, plastic, poured baits,wire baits, terminal tackle...whatever. It's a decent pastime for those days when you can't get out for whatever reason. I've got some on the go right now. These are mainly large baits between 9"" and 14""...still have finishing touches, lips and hardware to do on these. They're all weighted and will run between 5' and 15'.

I went for some shore walleye fishing, and the river is just cluttered with fallen leaves/branches. So, after a few nice smallies, I decided to rig up something for the walleye that wouldn't have me pulling leaves off after every cast. Turns out, worked amazing, at least for today. Went 8/8 in a little over an hour on the walleye.  I'm sure it's nothing novel, but it is to me, check it out. This one is rigged with a Berkley bait. The one that landed all the walleye was rigged with a 4"" black shad berkley Gulp minnow.  Never got any snags, even fishing the rock side. No weeds nor leaves at all, I'm really liking this rig for the fall!  "

629078,Roy,2011-10-09 03:15:00,13728,"Thanks a lot guys. That's a good rig, Manitou. There's really no need to conform to what everyone else is using. Try different things and if it works for you, as Lew would say, it's just another tool in the toolbox. A lot of folks here make some really nice stuff."
629081,irishfield,2011-10-09 03:22:00,26272,Yah.. dat Roy guy makes some pretty neat wood baits.

629093,lew,2011-10-09 09:05:00,12766,"I don't build baits Roy, but I'll sometimes repaint them if I don't find the original colors working the way I want.  Here's a few I've repainted but there's nothing fancy, but then again, I've never found muskies to be too fussy when their hungry  You can also see the black spots on top of some of the baits   where I've removed the rattles and epoxyed over the holes.  BumbleBee Double ""D"" in the bottom pic turned out to be one of my best producers, so it's often worth re-doing  a bait if it's not working.      "
