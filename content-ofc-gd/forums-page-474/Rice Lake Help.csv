A friend of mine is renting a boat from Musky Bay Resort (its their 2nd time fishing, they just got into it this late into the season.)  I have my own boat, a 18 foot lund, is their a launch at that location and how much does it cost? Or am i better off launching elsewhere? I plan to meet up with my buddies though.  Any fishing tips on rice this late in the year. I usually fish pigeon lake so am not familiar with the lake at all. Been heading out for musky the past 2 weeks. Hit simcoe last week but got skunked on bass. Was thinking of Simcoe this week but with 20km winds i dont want to fish in 4 footers again. Im looking to catch whatever bites lol.  Thanks for the help, appreciate it!"

I don't know how much it costs to launch, but it's $20 a day for dock space - so that might include launch fees?  I don't own a boat but I rent boats from them quite often.  The owner is a nice guy and his prices for accommodations and boat rentals are very competitive."
