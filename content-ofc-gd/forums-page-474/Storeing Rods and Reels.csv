634884,Beans,2011-10-27 19:42:00,3339, Good tip Bruce...No wonder my 40 year old original Mitchell 300 reel sounded like a coffee grinder...Retired it to the Wall of Fame at my son's trailer at Rice Lake but someone scooped it...  I just did my carp baitrunners yesterday...still using a couple of ultralites...hoping to nail some crappie...dinky perch so far...  
634913,aplumma,2011-10-27 20:30:00,6896,Paul I have (2) 10 foot pieces of 1 1/2 pvc pipe hung from the garage ceiling and spaced them so the reel handle is on one and the other is 3 or 4 foot from that. It supports them horizontally without putting pressure on them in a negative way. I would not store rods so they have pressure on the tips like leaning against the wall. Truth be told I have not had any proof that is bad but I also don't want to test it on my rods. I am sure Spiel or some of the other rod builders will answer this pressing question.   Art
635354,mercman,2011-10-28 19:50:00,7054, Thanks Art ! Thats a dang good idea.I think i have some lengths of PVC left over from when i did the plumbing for my bathroom.Now i just hope the mice dont chew the cork off the handles
635398,GBW,2011-10-28 21:58:00,8460,"Come on Paul.  take 2x of wood, drill a few holes in them and mount them to the ceiling in the basement and hang the rods there and the reels on a bench if not still on the rod.  you will end up restringing most reels next year anyway as you will want to try something new I bet..."
635403,mercman,2011-10-28 22:18:00,7054,"  Yer probably right.I like the pvc tube idea though.I will take the reels off,cause i want to replace the Suffix 832 with PP, and the Nanofil with Siege Mono I wasnt impressed by either this season."
635413,lookinforwalleye,2011-10-28 22:50:00,4399,Never have released the drag on any of my reels in 35 years and never had a failure but hey what ever floats your boat!  And don`t store your batteries on the concrete!!!
635425,Roy,2011-10-28 23:47:00,13728, :D
634633,mercman,2011-10-27 01:37:00,7054,"Last year i had 1 combo each, for my wife and i. It made it easy to keep them inside, in a corner of my theater room.Well, this year is a different story.I now have 7 combos.I want to keep them in the rafters of my unheated workshop. Will the cold dry air have any ill effect on the reels,rods or line?  I have rod gloves on all of them, but nothing to protect the reels.  "
634636,DRIFTER_016,2011-10-27 01:44:00,10439,Just use the spare bedroom.        You can store your ice hut in the spare washroom.  
634638,Twocoda,2011-10-27 01:44:00,4130,never heard a reel complain about the cold before...they will be fine Paul  Dave carpet in the bathroom????  lol
634639,bigbuck,2011-10-27 01:45:00,2449,You will be fine. I would clean and lube the reels now so all they will need for next year is fresh line. Check the guides in your rods for chips and cracks replace as necessary.
634642,skeeter,2011-10-27 01:47:00,1907,"No it wont hurt them, as long as the rods are straight. You could buy a rod holder for the wall of your theater room, or one that spins around!"
634646,mercman,2011-10-27 01:55:00,7054," ya i could. My house was built in 1941, and only has a 6Ft ceiling in the basement, so i cant stand the rods up.Thank god i""m only 5'9 Hey Drifter......Carpet in the bathroom???  JK"
634661,uglyfish,2011-10-27 02:40:00,981,"Make sure u LOOSEN the drag on all the reels that u are storing!! That's the most important thing. If u keep the drags set tight u will/could compress the drag discs and they can warp and stick, essentially screwing up ur drag and costing u for replacement parts"
634663,lookinforwalleye,2011-10-27 02:42:00,4399, My wife freaks when I bring my stuff inside...Dave you must be single or have a really understanding wife.
634664,OutdoorDan,2011-10-27 02:45:00,325," Maybe that's what the sleeping bag in the ""spare"" room is for?"
634698,skeeter,2011-10-27 11:55:00,1907,"Uglyfish is correct on the drag. You do know that there are vertical,horizontal & over head rod racks?"
634711,Lunker777,2011-10-27 12:39:00,866, I wish I had a pick of my storage system ! My grandpa fashioned a rack out of some old pine we had.... mounted on the ceiling in my bed room....Go to bed looking at my rods and wake up looking at my rods. I was single at this point...... chicks dug it  haha
634713,BillM,2011-10-27 12:46:00,17367,"My dad made storage racks for all our rods/reels.  Unheated basement, never an issue."
634714,mercman,2011-10-27 12:48:00,7054,"  My Pomeranian is a chick magnet, I never looked at a fishing rod as one, but i can see how it could be"
634739,GBW,2011-10-27 13:46:00,8460,"Paul, I use this in my basement for now.    Rod holder  If you are decent at doing any wood work you can make one of these too. wood rod holder"
634740,GBW,2011-10-27 13:51:00,8460,Or you can review this old thread and get some ideas...  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=49953&st=0&p=539806&hl=rod%20holder&fromsearch=1entry539806
634763,mercman,2011-10-27 14:43:00,7054,"  i think i'm leaning more towards the ceiling mounted racks.i can find an out of the way place on the ceiling, where the reels wont be in the way."
634769,Roy,2011-10-27 15:02:00,13728, Take the reels off the rods.
634770,GBW,2011-10-27 15:02:00,8460,I was just going to say that...
634794,mercman,2011-10-27 15:53:00,7054,  What......and have to restring them all next year I think not
634798,motion,2011-10-27 16:02:00,403,You'll be fine Paul. Just make sure that you keep the rod socks on them for protection while handling them. The cold will do them no harm.
634812,jpfishing,2011-10-27 16:32:00,53,  No bad outcome storing my setup's as uglyfish said store them correctly and you'll be fine
634827,smally21,2011-10-27 17:33:00,993,"i used to take them all out of the boat im starting to just leave them in their rod tube 'beds' in the boat. haven't seen any negative effects, plus handling a dozen or so rods, taking them down to the storage room, jamming them in a locker, etc. is just another opportuity to damage them.  i dont think they are effected by cold, but storing them clean and oiled is a great tip.  nice call on the drag, i had not thought of that before. thanks."
634828,Miracon,2011-10-27 17:47:00,200,Thanks for this thread! We have our 2 new combos and the old one's we discovered at my mother-in-laws house that I would never have thought I needed to do anything with while resting in the garage through the winter! So I appreciate the info being provided here!
634871,Billy Bob,2011-10-27 19:16:00,5865,"I have stored all my rods in my unheated, unattached garage for the last 30 years without any issues. With my boat in the garage I can store all my fishing ""stuff"" in the garage rafters above....choosing whatever I need to use for that particular outing.  If there were issues with cold storage on our rods and reels we wouldn't be able to use them for ice fishing....  Bob"
634878,lew,2011-10-27 19:28:00,12766, I loosen  all my drags at the end of EVERY day's fishing. Not sure if that's really necessary or not but I've never had a problem with the drag on any reel.  Just be sure to tighten them again when you head out next time.
