634475,tb4me,2011-10-26 19:09:00,3295,Good Gawd....That was nasty.. I cant think for even a second that that kid survived that one...
634594,OutdoorDan,2011-10-26 23:22:00,325, A little faster and he might have cleared the bridge.
634599,NAW,2011-10-26 23:26:00,4022,"Ya, I saw that on a TV show.  Absolutely crazy. The car broke apart around him, and he kept going."
634678,smally21,2011-10-27 03:54:00,993,the reference to micheal knight is classic.
633809,tb4me,2011-10-24 22:10:00,3295,"Speed kills folks....just watch this crash test to see for yourself..Note thou this is very graphic no humans get hurt..It is a must see for anyone with a lead foot    <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/l4PjSVOnrVg"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
633813,Joey,2011-10-24 22:27:00,9122,"WOW, brutal.  That's sure something to think about!!!!"
633814,mercman,2011-10-24 22:30:00,7054,"they should show this over and over and over and over, to some of the total ijuts i see on the road every single day i drive. Problem is, some of them would think that this vid is COOL"
633817,irishfield,2011-10-24 22:37:00,26272,"COOOL !!  Oh.. and remember, if you are gonna head on someone be sure to accelerate so you become the cement wall !  ...and the error in the video. That is not the same as two vehicles doing 120mph hitting head on.. that simulates two vehicles doing 60 mph hitting head on."
633818,OutdoorDan,2011-10-24 22:41:00,325,Take wreckages like that and put them on a pedestal at every on-ramp onto the 401.  Safer driving ensues.
633820,Terry,2011-10-24 22:51:00,14456,like Irishfield said 60 mph head on crash
633821,irishfield,2011-10-24 22:54:00,26272,Though it does simulate pretty well one of my old teenhood friends hitting a bridge abutment @ somewhere beyond 150 MPH in his 'Cuda though.
633823,mercman,2011-10-24 22:56:00,7054, I shoulda known
633826,kickingfrog,2011-10-24 23:03:00,8333,"Not quite guys, second car's (in a head on 60mph x2 crash) ""crumble"" zone would negate some of the impact where as the wall had very little, if any."
633827,irishfield,2011-10-24 23:06:00,26272,Oh definitely Rob... just pointing out a narrative mistake in the video. Two vehicles at 120mph would make more mess !  My old (dead) buddy didn't move the bridge abutment either... but we did get to salvage his Dana 60 locker rear differential.
633828,Terry,2011-10-24 23:11:00,14456, not if the second vehicle was a mack truck and a full load of cement
633831,kickingfrog,2011-10-24 23:25:00,8333,"Still ""better"" then the wall. Didn't the mythbusters do something like this?"
633836,irishfield,2011-10-24 23:40:00,26272,PFF.. myth busters. They also claimed that you can't chain a police car to a light standard and pull it's rear axle out from under it. I personally know that one is obtainable when you pick on an LTD...
633841,misfish,2011-10-24 23:46:00,29133,"Ah, we own a Focus,that didnt help.But then again,it,s her car,so I drive it slower then my truck  .  Must remember not to show this to the mrs,s"
633848,Roy,2011-10-25 00:04:00,13728,Coulda been worse. He coulda had a McDonald's coffee on his lap.
633853,tb4me,2011-10-25 00:13:00,3295,lol
633877,Fisherman,2011-10-25 01:02:00,7201,"Speed doesn't kill, it's the incredibly fast stop that does all the damage."
633883,mercman,2011-10-25 01:23:00,7054,"Just so happens, Canada's Worst Driver starts tonite."
633886,Terry,2011-10-25 01:29:00,14456, really  where are you going   LOL
633887,HTHM,2011-10-25 01:31:00,4082,"Let me guess, they're all from Quebec???"
633888,dhickey,2011-10-25 01:33:00,1038,    What HT said.
633895,Roy,2011-10-25 01:47:00,13728," Actually it's 1 from BC, 3 from AB, 1 from SK, 1 from ON, 1 from QC and 1 from NS. But the 3 from AB probably come from QC."
633898,mercman,2011-10-25 01:52:00,7054, We only SEEM like bad drivers.We dont leave any witnesses though
633951,fishing n autograph,2011-10-25 11:34:00,2540,Or any friends to rat us out!
634238,BUSTER,2011-10-26 01:49:00,1336,REAL CRASH TEST
