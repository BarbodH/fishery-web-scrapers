635260,ah_long,2011-10-28 16:45:00,354,There's a scam on CL right now and it's using FishOn's pictures.. beware  http://toronto.en.craigslist.ca/tor/boa/2669969567.html  
635266,jimmer,2011-10-28 16:55:00,2730,"These kind of deals have been running for awhile, also on Kijiji. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Especially in Canada."
635268,OutdoorDan,2011-10-28 16:58:00,325,At least the price is a giveaway...  Was the picture originally posted on OFC?  It pisses me off that there are scumbags like this lurking here.
635269,Roy,2011-10-28 17:00:00,13728,"And that's one of the reasons we don't allow newly registered members to post to the classifieds....it's to protect the community. If you can find what you want here, it's much safer."
635299,manitoubass2,2011-10-28 17:45:00,11391,"I've read a few of these on this board now, and I am wondering what the scam is????  Ok, the price is obviously too good to be true, unless it's being sold by a women scorned or a crackhead selling possessions for the next fix, but...  If I was willing to purchase this boat, I would drive/fly to the said location to purchase the boat. Is the boat not actually for sale???  What is going on here?"
635305,manitoubass2,2011-10-28 17:53:00,11391,"  Ahhh, I see.     "
635309,manitoubass2,2011-10-28 17:55:00,11391," For sure.  Now, any ideas how I can get my money back???     "
635312,Krisco,2011-10-28 17:59:00,67,"The boat is no longer for sale as I purchased it earlier today. I was able to talk him down to $4485.00 so I think I got a good deal. As a matter of fact I just wired the money to his account in Russia, not sure why he wanted it sent there but none of business I suppose.  He told me I could pic the boat up tonight but not until after midnight as he needed to clean it up a bit 1st. He is working midnights so he will not be home but said not to worry and gave me his address with directions. The ownerships will be signed over and left in the glove box with a receipt.  Sounded like a hell of a nice guy to me."
635315,manitoubass2,2011-10-28 18:02:00,11391," So, the beer is on you tonight? I'll meet you there 12:30 sharp"
635327,BillM,2011-10-28 18:28:00,17367, LOL!!!!  Love it!!!!!
635347,jimmer,2011-10-28 19:21:00,2730,At least we're all learning something useful!
635395,GBW,2011-10-28 21:51:00,8460,says who?  my head hutrs now and I'm comfused...
635400,express168,2011-10-28 22:03:00,327,"There has been a 1969 Camaro metallic blue with white rally stripes and completly restored top to bottom on Kijijii for the last month or so for only $7,900. What a deal, at that price I can't belive it has been there for a month!"
635407,Krisco,2011-10-28 22:30:00,67, I purchased that Camaro over a week ago so I'm not sure why he hasn't taken the ad down. As a matter of fact I just had a new trailer hitch installed this afternoon so I can pick up my new boat with it later tonight
635411,lookinforwalleye,2011-10-28 22:37:00,4399,"It`s an old scam that is run on virtually every sales site, before I bought the Stratos half the ads I looked at were bogus and for the most part the sites could care less.  I had one   try to sell me a boat that was sold on E-bay the previous month,scammers everywhere. You know what they say if it sounds to good to be true........!"
