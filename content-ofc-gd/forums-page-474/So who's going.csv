However, I believe they are deep in talent.  Go Ralph Wilson, and leave the Bills behind....  Edited as per requested...."

635410,Billy Bob,2011-10-28 22:32:00,5865, Drag yourself out of your mama's basement...sell some extra weed and get us both tickets....
635418,GBW,2011-10-28 23:09:00,8460,If I could do that I would be on the water fishing rather than be at that game!
635420,mercman,2011-10-28 23:18:00,7054, Since when do you get money for weeds  Can i get a piece of the action?
635421,fisherman7,2011-10-28 23:23:00,325,I'm going with my Redskin Fan-Atical wife and Bill's nut brother-in-law. Wish me luck!
635422,kickingfrog,2011-10-28 23:24:00,8333,"Four of us drove to 3 hours to Orchard Park and then our wives went shopping and it still cost less then it would to go to a Bills game in T.O.  Problems with Bills in T.O.  1. Corporate bozos badly misjudged the price point  2. It may be a ""home"" game for the bills but it is more of a neutral site type feel i.e.. no atmosphere.  3. Tough to get regular Joes, and Jills (see what I did there?), in the mood with a lack of a true tailgate... no atmosphere again.  4. Up until this season the Bills have come in with no buzz"
635432,Billy Bob,2011-10-29 00:09:00,5865, That's because GBW has hoarded all the weed in his mama's basement....  (I couldn't resist)
635465,Woodsman,2011-10-29 01:49:00,1286,With the price of tickets forget it. Cheapest seat in the house in the nose bleed zone is over $60. Not that many at this price also. All others over $100 with the top seats at just over $285.
635487,Grimace,2011-10-29 04:31:00,2020, Square on the head.   More like a bowl game I suppose.
635545,GBW,2011-10-29 14:23:00,8460,good one BB!
635562,Pikeslayer8,2011-10-29 15:55:00,336,"Really funny thread Billy Bob.  The grammar police, Pin Ball, GBW hoarding weed, hilarious.  Me, I personally don't like to give my $ to feed the beast that is pro sports.  I will be watching, however. Go Bills, Go Vikings"
