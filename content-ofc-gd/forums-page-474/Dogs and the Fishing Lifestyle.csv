635480,Joey,2011-10-29 02:55:00,9122,"Well we want to thank you all for your advice, tips and pictures  We have decided we will get a dog and I'll be posting the new puppy pictures when I pick the new addition to our family up, hopefully this weekend  p.s.  Roy wants us to call it Dwarfy..   Your thoughts"
635483,Sinker,2011-10-29 03:10:00,8692,"I like molson, or gibson. My next dog will be one or the other.  S."
635490,Grimace,2011-10-29 04:42:00,2020,I did not read this whole thing but here is my dog that is no longer with us.   Zoey is dead now for about 6 months.  I love/loved that dog.       RIP Zoey.   Great dog!!!
635499,bigugli,2011-10-29 08:11:00,6138,"  Jacks are the perfect fishing buddy. Just the right size in a boat, and just as excited as yourself to hook and land a fish. "
635502,Handlebarz,2011-10-29 10:26:00,3790,Bruiser loves to get out fishing he just loves the boat he has not tried to jump out yet. he also knows when we are not catching fish as you can tell from these pics he will stand and watch the rods as if he is waiting for the clicker to go off. \      I think alot has to do with how you train your dog if you put in alot of time then there should not be a problem Bruiser knows what to do when your fighting a fish just tell him to go to the front of the boat and he will stay there until you have it in the bag.   As for hotels there are alot of them that allow it most charge $10-$15 more for them and usually have a size restrictions we would just make sure to enter through the back door and have him out of sight not easy to do with a 100lbs lab.
635014,Terry,2011-10-27 23:35:00,14456,a cat you can leave alone in the house for a weekend  a dog you must find a place to stick them if you can't take them with you....  a stuffed animal is very self reliant....they don't bark or piss on the rug and you can leave them at home..always...something to think about.. LOL

635038,msp,2011-10-28 00:36:00,1336,Just dont take them river fishing in the fall. They ALL love to roll in dead salmon. Its like perfume for them. It makes for a smelly ride home.
635059,Joey,2011-10-28 01:15:00,9122,"  OMG, that was classic Ron, thanks for the laugh.  I'll give ya a belly rub just for that"

635073,Ron,2011-10-28 02:13:00,1683,Ha ha ha  A dwarf dog sleeps all day long and wouldn't even notice you missing! LMAO!!!!
635079,Sinker,2011-10-28 02:23:00,8692,"If you take the dog with you everywhere you go, from the time you get it, it will adjust to your lifestyle, no problem.  When I got Wyatt from Harrison, he was NUTS in the boat, and would drive me crazy at times. The more I took him out, the better he got. Now he has his place, and is no trouble at all. I don't think Phil took him fishing at all LOL. I'm sure he was never in a boat before....if he was, it wasn't often enough!! He LOVES it now, and I take him everywhere!!  Dogs will take after thier owner. As long as you spend the time with them, they are happy to go anywhere with you.  S."

If my dog can't go...they can shove their cottage up their..  "
635092,NAW,2011-10-28 02:58:00,4022,"My dog loves to go fishing, and she loves being in the boat.  But I always make sure she's wearing a life vest.  A few years back on cooks bay, she jumped over board, and we ran her over.  Almost got dinged by the prop.  This was a few minutes before the big jump.   And this was a few minutes after..  Not a happy dog.  Coughed up water the rest of the trip.  We bought her a life vest later that week.   Dogs are great, but they're not for everyone.  It can be a bit of a pain when need to find a sitter for them.  But well worth of effort in my eyes."
635097,Joey,2011-10-28 03:14:00,9122,"Well these are a lot of great tips and advice.  Love the pictures too.  The dogs sure do seem to be lovin it   Well except for yours in the second pic NAW, glad he was okay!!    I have another question then, how do you handle it in the boat then when the weather is cold or hot?  Like what about BOQ fishing in November, ice fishing, or fishing in August when you're camping?"
635102,NAW,2011-10-28 03:24:00,4022," My dog doesn't like the cold, and I'm worried she would fall in a hole.  So I don't take her ice fishing.  As for the heat, there is a nice shady spot in the back of my boat that always stays cool.  I throw a towel in there, and she will lay in there for hours, or until I catch a fish."
635106,Jen,2011-10-28 03:40:00,833,"Size of a dog is really important, atleast it was to me Joey.  My kids bugged and bugged to get a dog, and when I finally gave in we decided on a beagle.  Lily is small enough to pick up and take anywhere, she hunts rabbits, rarely barks, although she does occationally howl when she is hunting or when she wants something.  When she was a pup I made sure she was crate trained.  Now she goes everywhere with me!  The crate goes in the back of the car, she hops in and off we go.  Since she is fairly small and the crate is light I carry her into the office and take her outside to play often. If she stays home I have a kennel outside with a dog house, however we don't often use it. She is never left at home in the house alone.  If you start when they are young and make them a part of everything you do dogs adapt to your lifestyle.  She has been such a wonderful addition to our family, and honestly I love having her with me all the time.        "
635107,Joey,2011-10-28 03:47:00,9122,"Good points Jen.  I am very lucky and live only 6 kms from work.  I come home for lunch every day so that is a plus, and my boss would have no problem with me taking the dog to work either.  We had another co-worker who brought his to work every day while he was a puppy.  Well you've all almost got me talked into it"
635131,Jewelbee,2011-10-28 08:34:00,422," If you start them early, dogs can adapt to anything! Gee, how bout dogs that ride on motorcycles, and service dogs that do it all. I think that a mid sized dog would make things easier, but that is a personal decision. So far in my experience, traveling with dogs, it's no problem. If possible ,just call ahead and most motels have rooms set aside for those traveling with their pets Think it over and best of luck! There is no love like that given by a dog BTW....I can't wait to see your baby pictures"

635141,bigugli,2011-10-28 10:12:00,6138,"I(n the hot summer, a dog will find a shady spot to hide. However, peanut does have a PFD and she would go for a swim during our outings. Small dogs may swim, but they can't stay afloat forever. In colder weather, peanut has a coat. We are going to take her for a few ice fishing trips this year."
635189,Jer,2011-10-28 13:38:00,1426,"My big old guy, Bear, used to love riding in the boat:     This was one of his last trips when he was 13:     I don't seem to have any pics of Moosy in the boat, but she loves it as well. Here is one out ice-fishing, give her a ball and she's entertained for hours:     What I found with my dogs and fishing, is that they were much better behaved in the boat when I was out alone with them. With a partner in the boat, they seemed much more impatient."
635199,fishnsled,2011-10-28 14:08:00,3520,"      Surprised I don't see a picture of your new pooch yet Joey. (Sorry Paul) If it wasn't for my work hours and commuting I'd have a dog. As for the the days on the water, a dog would be great company. (Joe and Cliff get on my nerves and they just never shut up.... ) Watch the hooks, a couple of trips to shore through out the day for a bathroom break I would guess (might make the Lake Ontario and Quinte trips shorter ), keep them comfortable, a friend for life, just like Joe and Cliff."
635210,Beans,2011-10-28 14:28:00,3339," Riley liked to come with me icefishing but was not too keen on going in the ""Tin of Beans""...didn't like the vibrations from the motor...    I would bring his ""blankie"" for him to curl up on in the box..."
635252,danbouck,2011-10-28 16:33:00,4380,"I have 2 large dogs and they can be quite a handful while camping or fishing with the kids. Back in the day before the kids they would have been no problem, but now we usually get a dog sitter for fishing trips or they stay at the cottage. I love my dogs regardless and would love to take them everywhere but it's not possible a lot these days. For week long vacations they always come though.  I don't see any problems with hotels or campsites.  I can see you guys being very happy with a new fishing partner.    "
635259,OutdoorDan,2011-10-28 16:44:00,325," How tolerant the dog will be to heat/cold really depends on the kind of dog you get.  Regardless, for ice fishing, one of these can go a long way:"

634870,Joey,2011-10-27 19:15:00,9122,"After losing our beloved cat of 18 years earlier this year, I have been seriously considering getting another family pet.  I have the resources and the love to give a pet, and am thinking maybe this time we should get a dog (I have owned dogs before).  I am questioning this decision due to our fishing lifestyle and wonder how many of you have dogs and if it affects your fishing lifestyle in a good or bad way?  Do you take your dog with you on every trip?  If you do, does he enjoy it, especially in the boat?  If not, what do you do with the dog when you go?  Do most hotels/motels allow a dog?  Do most campsites/cabins allow a dog?  Any of your experiences, good or bad, would be very helpful in my decision, so thanks in advance.  Joey"
634879,motion,2011-10-27 19:36:00,403,"Hey Joey. As you can tell by my avatar, I have a chocolate Lab named Toby. He's still a young dog (13 months old) and I take him everywhere with me. He's a great dog who loves to be out on the boat with us.  He gets a little fussy on the longer boat trips that I have learned to bring a few treats and toys to settle him down. He really enjoys trying to fight with the fish we land  He is really good company for me when I fish alone.  Most campsites that I have visited do allow pets (on leashes).  Hope that helps you in your decision.  Tony"
634886,LeXXington,2011-10-27 19:44:00,1928,"Hi Joey.  Best fishing partner I had was my dog.  Sorry to all that fish with me  She loved the boat, water and going out. When I was packing for trips she would sleep on my stuff to make sure I did not forget her.  She would sit at the back of the boat waiting for the salmon to make the reel scream.  then do the happy dance and lick the fish.  Lots of hotels now accept dog's unfortunately they make sure you pay extra for it.  Same for camp sites.  My dog was only out a few times this year before she passed away.. I miss her on the boat as the extra company is great.   "
634887,lew,2011-10-27 19:44:00,12766,"Marvin loves a boat ride Joey and would happily cruise around all day, but as soon as I start to speed up he gets nervous. I think it may be from the vibration of the faster speeds.  Also, everytime I make a cast he thinks I'm throwing a ball and tries to dive in the drink to retrieve it.  So yes, my dog enjoys fishing, but I can only go 1 MPH and I'm not allowed to cast.  Just something for you to think about  "
634888,Rich Clemens,2011-10-27 19:44:00,3131,"We have two dogs and typically they go with us on all our fishing trips  (except for our Lakair GTG).  They both also go with us out on the boat and behave very well.  We also bring along some snacks, but they want them the  minute we get them in the boat.  They're fine for hours.   Once in a while we'll pull up on shore to let them out to take are of business and run a round a bit - which they just love.    Our Airdale does not like the water and is not a swimmer, so she wears a life jacket - and does not mind it at all.   Of course, having pets does limit us on which camps we can go to - due to a ""No Pets"" policy.    Some camps do charge extra for pets as well."
634891,lew,2011-10-27 19:53:00,12766,"I don't think you and Paul leave baits laying around the boat Joey, but it's something you'll have to be thinking about all the time. I know guys who switch baits, throw them on the floor of the boat and the next thing you know, the poor pooch has one in his foot."
634895,Roy,2011-10-27 19:59:00,13728," How about a dwarf dog Joey? I'm good with everything on that list plus, I'm small, I don't take up too much room and I clean up my own messes."
634896,mercman,2011-10-27 20:02:00,7054,"Hi Joey  My Lab hates the boat, My Pom loves it. Most campsites have no problem with dogs, Hotels tend to be less tolerant.Then again, it depends what kind of dog.I even take my Pom shopping.My Lab would break everything in the store, and lick all the customers I am very lucky to have neighbors i can trust, so they take care of them for me when i go away for more that a day trip.  "
634906,Big Cliff,2011-10-27 20:17:00,6899,"Andy use to love to fish, and he was wonderful in the boat, well, he did get a little excited when you caught a fish and heaven help you if you threw it back, he actually dove in off the dock to try and retrieve a large carp one time because he thought it was getting away.  Only issue we ever had was my own fault, I left a tray of luers sitting on the casting deck (closed) someone hooked a fish, Andy got excited, stepped on the tray which promptly flipped up in the air and opened showering Andy with countless trebble hooks. Fortunatly he was trained to freeze on the spot when told. I gave him the command, he froze and while many of the luers landed on him and caught in his fur none of the hooks dug into him but it could have been a disaster.  Because Sue doesn't fish Andy never interfeared with my fishing, there was always one of us around to take care of him and if and when we did travel we always had someone that would come and stay at our house with him.  I think it is wonderful that you are thinking about getting a dog, I can't think of a more loving home for one but since both you and Paul like to fish together I do think it would make it more difficult for you. Good luck whatever your decision ends up being."
634907,Rich Clemens,2011-10-27 20:17:00,3131,"  Exactly, and an excellent point.  We make sure nothing with a hook is in a place the dogs can get to it - accidently or just by curiosity."
634908,aplumma,2011-10-27 20:19:00,6896,I would go to the local animal adoption and see if they have a dog that has outdoor life experience that is in the mid size range. I think a corgi would be a great dog for you and Paul. They are the right size and built for the outdoors and have a great personality for you and the people you visit.  Art
634911,capt bruce,2011-10-27 20:28:00,820,"ya but Roy dont think Joey would go for your licking your .... J I have two of the largest Bouviers you have ever seen Bov on a good days is 140 and Ollie is easy 160 , even on my boat (42 foot sport fish) they take up the whole back deck , tho they are old now (13 years) they love it in the boat, took them on many trips on the boat, to Jamaica , all the southern states , I have taken my boat to greenland with them , before I got sick every 2 or 3 years we went to spend the winter somewear in the boat . best fishing partners I ever had . Maybe expect for the time I pulled into Youngstown to gas up for the trip back to TO and as I was getting On plane I looked back and no dogs on the deck , as I said they are hard to miss ,Turned aroud and there they were setting on the end of the gas dock waiting for me to return . Dogs require lots of time , not like a cat you cant go away for the weekend and just leave them , but I have  snuck them up the back stairs in many a hotel/motel camping site etc. if I can hide two monsters one dog of normal size should not be too much trouble, like they say dogs are mans best friend .If you put in the time to train them never been a problem with me and fishing ."
634918,lew,2011-10-27 20:46:00,12766,Great story Capt Bruce and I can't believe all the places you've travelled on your boat.  Love the part about the dogs on the dock

And Roy, if you fetch Paul a beer, you're in  I've been looking at the French Bulldog, mostly for size and they seem non-hyper, and many other reasons, they just seem to be a good fit.  Still pondering here though, and I appreciate all the responses."
634929,ChrisK,2011-10-27 21:02:00,2772,"Joey, All depends what size dog you feel most comfortable with. They all adapt well to your activities especially when you get them as pups and take them wherever you go."

634940,crappieperchhunter,2011-10-27 21:24:00,2582,Funny how things work out. I always said the first thing I wanted to get when I retired was a fishing dog. We had 2 dogs and a cat when we got married but my daughters severe reactions to flea bites made us give up our furry friends. Fast forward and circumstances conspired to have us with 2 cats  instead. But I still wanted a dog as I always had one growing up. One cat is gone now but I have really grown to love the one we have. So much so that I'm starting to rethink getting a dog when I retire... they are just that much more work and an inconvenience when you wanna travel. I am told we will be doing MUCH travelling when we retire. Our lifestyle now is much more suited to having a nice friendly cat to come home too. I never ever thought I would be a cat person...but I guess it is true. Pearl...our kitty... has made me appreciate having a cat.  Just tossing in my 2 cents  Joey. I know whatever decision you make will be right for yourself and Paul.

Depending on what size and kind of dog you get they may be a huge time investment and demand you to be really active with them.  Also -- if you take your dog ice fishing with you and use tip-ups, please be careful to never leave a minnow out of the water with hook/line still attached.  I had a really scary experience with this a couple of years ago.  Since people are posting pics:   "
