635076,craigdritchie,2011-10-28 02:18:00,1586,Eat fish from Hamilton harbour?  I wouldn't even feed them to my cat.
635132,pikehunter,2011-10-28 08:35:00,1659,"Normally harbour fish are OK to eat, I have never though. The sign you have shown above was a warning during the algae bloom, it happens every year. The bloom however is long over and the person who is to take the signs down more than likely hasn't got around to it yet."

635338,scugpg,2011-10-28 18:58:00,1373,I've read conflicting info on this - the safe to eat articles I read stated to ensure you don't eat any organs (liver etc) that absorbs the majority of the bacteria from the algae and eat only the fillets.
635342,jimmer,2011-10-28 19:10:00,2730,I think they ate some of the fish! LOL
635343,northernpike56,2011-10-28 19:11:00,717,  I catch mutated fish every so often at la salle and cootes paradise.
