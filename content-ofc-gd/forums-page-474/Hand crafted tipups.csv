634855,Rod Caster,2011-10-27 18:46:00,5784,"After viewing Leechman's post in the thread ""bait making"", I immediately sent him a PM, praising him for the great looking tipups he builds himself and wondered if was interested in taking a small order, since these were exactly what I was looking for for this winter. He promptly accepted my request and began building me a pair of tipups!  I just arrived from a couple days out of town and instead of completing my paperwork, or stopping at the office, I drove staight to the post office, picked up the package, drove home, my truck is still unlocked I think and opened his deliberate and tape intensive ( ) wrapping. Found: two perfect tipups!  these things are even better in person. Very well crafted, they look durable (he's been doing it for 20years) and function perfectly. They have ball bearing (rattle) spools and adjustable sensitivity.    the million dollar signature.   I tied a snap swivel (cat bait) and yes, they work great!     FISH ON!   Thanks again Jacques... Jasmine likes them too! Now bring on some ice.  "

635096,Leecher,2011-10-28 03:05:00,7832,"Your welcome Chad    I'm glad you finally receive the package and liked them    Those two were a 14 hours + project and they simply are the best tipups you'll ever find anywhere on the planet    and not sold in any stores  One thing I notice in the pics is, you have the top up side down.... the reel must be facing down... this will prevent any snow from accumulating when there's a snow storm while out on the ice  Get the reels loaded with fishing line of your choice (I have mine loaded with 30Lbs Dacron... the black stuff) and then try the different adjustments... I have countersink the holes to make it easier to insert the nail and have a snug fit so not to loose them    The closest to the reel, the lighter and the farthest, the heavier depending on the species  of fish your are targetting  The rigs are simple and effective trust me... I've caught lots of fishes on them  Have fun with them and wish you a great hard water season!!! If you have any questions, send me a PM Tight lines Jacques"
635100,GBW,2011-10-28 03:21:00,8460,"Um, Jacques... The team 8 captain is still wondering where his 2 are...  They look great and I'm sure there will be many a fish caught on those, cheers!"
635109,adolson,2011-10-28 04:18:00,783,"Hey, those look pretty nice! I happen to know of a decent walleye lake about half-way between you and me. Now, I never tried it in the winter, and I'm not real sure how accessible it'll be with all the snow, but if you ever wanted to give it a shot, let me know..."
635112,Remastered,2011-10-28 04:35:00,143,Finally a decent tip-up! Do you make wind tip-ups?
635142,Sandbag,2011-10-28 10:42:00,533,Those tip-ups look awesome Jacques. Good luck with them this season Chad>  Now get that smoke alarm hung back on the wall.  Cheers  Craig
635159,LucG,2011-10-28 12:19:00,779,"Nice tipups for sure!  But since you forgot to include the OFC Sign in your pic, that cat wont qualifty for the OFC Tourny."
635168,Rod Caster,2011-10-28 12:38:00,5784," I should have known they were upside down. Thanks! I've loaded them both with 12lbs Trilene XL. No more braid for me this winter...too much of hassle trying let line down or bring it up in -30. Now I have my two jigging rods, two tipups and two tackle boxes ready for winter.   DANA:  Haha I think i know which lake you speak of... I am also interested in finding out if it produces in winter as well. Just made sure you seperate your bought filets from your caught ones.  CRAIG:  You know what? It's down for a fire alarm test.... I'm testing my GF to see how long she'll leave the fire alarm hanging like that before she A. asks me to do it B. does it herself. hahaha. I'm not the one who tried to cook pizza with the CARDBOARD still on.   LUC:  hahaha Someday I'll show you how I practice my Trophy Musky hold."
635246,Leecher,2011-10-28 16:27:00,7832,Thanks all for the compliments!!!    DOH... I'll get right on it mon Ca-pi-ten   No I don't Remastered
