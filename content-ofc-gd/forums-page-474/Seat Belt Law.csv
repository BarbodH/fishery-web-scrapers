634677,smally21,2011-10-27 03:43:00,993,"it was explained to me that the auto locking doors were provided to prevent intrusions into the vehicle, like a carjacking or something.  but the impediment to aiding or rescuing a trapped occupant is obvious, whether you are a bystander or first responder.  sinker are you sure you can't disconnect or 'deprogram'this - i could in some of my vehicles but not in others.  i find it oddly frustrating that some refer to the seatbelt as causing an injury,  but, was it not the accident that caused the injury?  the state of florida had an investigation into injuries caused by airbags - broken fingers, noses, abrasions to the face,etc. it was decided these injuries were better than having a steering column sticking out of your back. i tend to agree.  let me try to put it another way - if a motorcyclist crashed into a pole and died of head injuries, would we say he was killed by his helmet?"
634682,Billy Bob,2011-10-27 07:59:00,5865, Great observation....now think of this.....a small child must be strapped into a car seat and it seems every year said child is getting bigger/older before he's not required to do so....but that same child can jump on the back of a motorcycle and just hang on to the driver....  ...also in many states (not NYS) it's required to wear your seat belt but no helmet is required for the crotch rocket that just sped by you at twice the speed limit...
634683,Rizzo,2011-10-27 08:08:00,4754,"there's another good point - auto locking doors. What's more likely, that you will get car-jacked or get in an accident and possibly need help? What a dumb feature (if intrusion is the reason). If you live in Detroit, Washington or Miami - lock your doors. For the rest of us I'd prefer it stay unlocked in case I need help!"

634587,Handlebarz,2011-10-26 23:08:00,3790,Well before the count down hits 0 I must say I did not read all of this thread until I read Lews other one.  I must say first thanks to Lew for his other thread to direct me to Waynes post so I know who to thank for making seat belts.  As a truck driver I have always wanted to know who to thank for making them as they hold things in just right for truckers and I always wanted to thank the one who invented them but heck the guy who has been making them is close enough I love a tight seat belt in the summer  Thanks Wayne for the years ot tightness and if you know who invented them pass it along to him or her. ( I think it had to be a guy)  Oh yes I wear mine it costs to much to not wear it last time was 4 points I think and $200+ if I remember correctly been 10 years since then.
634603,mbac31,2011-10-26 23:36:00,904,"Seatbelts save lives no doubt. This one hits close to home all to well. 2 weeks ago on october 8th my 20 year old cousin was killed from one. They are not sure but she had the marks around her chest from wearing it but still was ejected from the car. 2 days before her birthday and 2 days before her boyfriend was going to ask for her hand.    In 1998 me and my wife made the front news page for our crash up in Uxbridge. Had to get a ride from a helicopter in that one. Thank god for seatbelts She was wearing one and it actually broke her pelvic bone from the impact. I hate to imagine what would of happened if she wasnt wearing one. That Video is true, the person not wearing one can cause more damage then the crash itself."

Both guys in the car were unconscious, and the car was on fire. I tried to get them out of the car, but the freakin doors were locked!!! i had to run back to my vehicle and get a hammer out of the trunk to break the window!! By the time I got back, the fire was almost to the cab of the car, and it was filling with smoke!!  Has any one else thought about this? Or is it just me?? I unlock mine as soon as I'm rolling.

If you look at the 6th or greater sigma that is where the anomalies are located, such as loss of life due to seatbelt use. So that indicates that a certain person is very special, he has observed anomalies as a greater portion of the population. I would agree with that analysis of these statistics, as the man in question has the respect of many people who know him. Not to mention he has raised one HECK of a tough daughter."

(and why I live less than one mile from their original Canadian belt facility) I've been in almost every seatbelt and airbag mfg facility in Canada, USA and Mexico to help engineer how they work and how to improve them.  Everyone here has been in a car with seat belt components that I've moulded over the last 26 years. From the belt tongue, with plastic moulded over the steel plate, to that stupid little button that keeps it from sliding down to the floor (24 million of those little buttons a year, in 61 different colours, in their hayday - now they're just sewing on a patch of belt)."

They both were wearing their seatbelts. Both came out with only minor scratches and bruises. I shuttered to think of what the results would have been if either one or both of them hadn't been wearing them. Seatbelts do save lives. Anyone not wearing them is a fool.

633993,lew,2011-10-25 13:38:00,12766,"I saw alot of nasty stuff over the years but one that always stuck with me was probably 40 years ago and involved a little Volkswagon Beetle and a big ole '67 Pontiac.  There were 3 ladies in the Bug with nobody  wearing a seat belt and the Pontiac crossed the road (Toronto street) and hit them head-on. The Pontiac probably weighed 3 times as much as the bug and when he hit them he just drove them straight back.  The lady in the back seat shot forward between the bucket seats and drove the 2 ladies in front under the dash board, including the driver who was bent around the steering column. The rear seat passenger continued flying thru the windshield, then landed on the roof of the Pontiac, then bounced off the roof and hit the road face first behind the car.  It took  a long time for us  to dismantle the Bug enough to get the women out and when we finally removed the driver her left foot remained in the car where it had been severed by the clutch pedal.  All 3 were alive when the ambulances took them away but were all terribly injured. We seldom followed up on things after the fact and I don't know if they survived or not.  I don't know what the outcome would have been had the ladies been wearing seatbelts, but I think it would have kept the lady in the back seat and she wouldn't have flown into the front and did so much damage to the others and herself.  This is just one story out of many but in my mind anyone who doesn't wear a belt is just plain foolish...but that's just my opinion."
634009,smally21,2011-10-25 14:35:00,993,and that is the message that first responders and law enforcement personnel should be sending.
634011,Harrison,2011-10-25 14:49:00,2202,"My Dad was a firefighter.  There were two things he was guaranteed to blow a gasket about, leaving something on the stairs and not wearing seat belts."
634023,cram,2011-10-25 15:31:00,1733,"To you firefighters and policemen.....seat belts aside, is side impact the biggest danger in accidents (where people are least protected and/or get hurt the most)?  Should i care more about side impact or roof/pillar strength when looking at a new car?"
634026,smally21,2011-10-25 15:40:00,993,"well, unless ya plan on being upside down.....  but serioiusly the front of your car is a 6foot crumple zone, the side is a 6 inch crumple zone. the common serioius injury in the side impact is the crushing of the pelvis and hips, but more importantly, the impact of the head striking the window or door pillars. side impact 'curtain' air bags can reduce or eliminate that injury.  side impact beams yada yada a big help but its hard to engineer something 6 inches thick to withstand that kind of collision. sounds kinda silly but this is the type of accident you most want to avoid...  rood pillar strength is vital to the rest of the car, cut the roof off a car you can practically fold it in half - but i think you are more likely to be in a broadside collision than end up upside down. rollovers dont really result in the serious injuries side impacts do...  my 2 cents ralph nader might disagree."
634027,fishing n autograph,2011-10-25 15:42:00,2540,"A motor vehicle collision has so many variables that it is hard to answer that question. Size, vehicle speed, road conditions, road design,, design of the car etc etc can affect it. I've seen a few mvcs where a driver survived because the point of impact was an inch to the right of the b pillar, had it been the other way he would have been dead.  You can't prevent collisions because 2 cars or more are involved. Your best bet would be to buy a car you feel comfortable driving and what you feel safe driving. Vehicles nowadays are safe as long as you operate it safe and according to road conditions.  Not sure if that answers any questions and im sure other members can add to the discussion."
634035,cram,2011-10-25 16:31:00,1733," Thanks.  You can get the new, tougher NHTSA safety/crash test results at safercar.gov....a lot of cars i had considered really safe (ie. subaru foresters) don't do that well in the side tests.  Surprising, actually."
634037,Roy,2011-10-25 16:45:00,13728,One of the easiest ways for auto manufacturers to reduce the need for side impact protection in cars is for them to eliminate the possibility of internet connection/reception for occupants of the front seats in cars while the engine is running. But that'll never fly.
634038,mercman,2011-10-25 16:49:00,7054,"Personally, i will take advantage of anything that has any possibility of saving my life when i am in a vehicule.Whether it be a seat belt in a car, or the tether and life jacket in my boat.Why would any sane person not want to do the same Argue any side you want, but seatbelts save more lives than they take.

634042,Terry,2011-10-25 16:53:00,14456,yeah Just for the record  I didn't say wearing seat belts is bad nor did I say people die because of wearing seat belts  what I really said was those type of movies are stupid and only convince the already converted and 6 year old kids..and they forget 2 weeks later
634044,mercman,2011-10-25 16:56:00,7054," Roy, Barb just bought a 2012 Jeep Compass Limited.she can not use the DVD function, or make changes to the onboard navigation without the car being in park. Also the blutooth phone will only work in voice command mode while the car is in gear, meaning it will not connect manually while the car is in gear. This is a great step in the right direction, but it is not standard in all cars, and it should be."

634054,mercman,2011-10-25 17:08:00,7054,"  Ya tell me about it. When we picked up the car, the Rep spent a half hour explaining how to program, the phone to accept voice commands, like Dial Home, etc.When the phone rings while driving, all you have to say is Connect. The GPS will work when you switch to NAV mode, but will only show you where you are. To program a route, you must pull over and put the car in park. Really great ideas."

634064,mercman,2011-10-25 17:27:00,7054," personally, merging and pulling over is safer.Signal lites and patience makes the manouver very safe. Normally a passenger in my car, would have no clue how to set the GPS in my car, and if iwas driving, it would be difficult for me not to be watching him carefully, to make sure he was doing it right But thats just me."
634070,adolson,2011-10-25 17:47:00,783,"I always wore my seatbelt, except once when I stopped at the post office on my way home. I didn't put my belt on for the 30-second trip from the post office to my driveway because well, it was 30 seconds and would almost take as long to buckle up. Lo and behold, a cop is waiting at the end of my street, 3 seconds from my driveway.  Now I wear my seatbelt even if I'm just moving my car to my lot across the road - they could be hiding in the bushes!"

634082,Miracon,2011-10-25 18:30:00,200,"When I was younger, I used to not bother to wear my seat belt. My argument always was that I didn't need one for my motorcycle nor on the bus. And then I totaled 2 bikes (the other guy was charged each time...had to mention!) and I learned what it was like to be ejected!  And to top it off, the first time I landed under a TTC bus just as it started to pull away (luckily the woman that got off the bus could scream really loud! Haha!) and the 2nd time I landed in oncoming traffic on Avenue Rd during rush hour. Another close call! Flying through the air and not knowing what the outcome of your landing is going to be is NOT fun! Especially when everything is in slow motion and you have time to think about it! Haha!  I always wear a seat belt now and make sure everyone else in the vehicle is buckled up also or the wheels don't move."

I watched it and it opened my eye's to what can really happen when 1 person in a car does not wear their seat belt. Before I watched this video my reaction to someone who wouldn't wear their seat belt was, ""well your over 16 so you will be paying the fine."" NOT any more. Wear it or get OUT! I showed this video to my kid's, in hopes that they would have the same reaction as I do now.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzvzqaicMz0&feature=related"

I say if someone else wants to go for the Darwin award, go for it..  just the same idea of using winter tires or not.. I actually think we should legislate winter tires before seat belts"
633921,OutdoorDan,2011-10-25 03:32:00,325,"ah_long,  Clearly the point here is that it's not just your own life you are endangering.

633928,woodenboater,2011-10-25 04:11:00,2277,"Thanks for posting this video skeeter !  Not sure if there's a video on Youtube but this pales compared to the ones you see in Australia re: drunk driving. Those are extremely graphic and extremely realistic and probably send a few people running to the washrooms to toss their cookies.  I used to be a 'will wear a seatbelt if I remember' kind of driver but now I'm like 99.9% of the population that buckles up instinctively and anyone who rides shotgun does the same or they get the Vinnimon treatment and rightly so.  I agree there could be less government involvement in many issues but on this one, not getting that feeling and don't understand the crowd that refuses to wear the belt."

The auto industry goes on and on about vehicle safety, but during a side impact there's nothing protecting you....that's what I would change, side airbags aren't an option in many vehicles"
633959,smally21,2011-10-25 12:12:00,993,"the difference between the injuries suffered by people not wearing seatbelts and those that do is huge. not to mention ive never seen someone ejected from a vehicle that was wearing a seatbelt. cars very rarely catch fire during accidents, unless on tv. you have to survive the accident first, then get out of the car - wether it is on fire or submerged...  i was at an accident a while ago with a kid who had supermanned from the back seat and was perfectly lodged up to his waist in the windshield with his hands by his sides  -  2 other passengers uninjured in the back seat...which one had a belt on?  if you want to get put back together by the shared healthcare system you have to play ball and wear your seatbelt. (kinda same issue as motorcycle helmet)  as for side impacts i know what your sayin' FFA but it keeps you in your seat - consider 2 people in the front seat getting broadsided - the impact caused few injuries but neither was wearing their seatbelts, they smacked their heads together like a couple of high speed lovebirds - perhaps seatblets may have restrained them...can't say really - and you can be ejected from side impacts  unrestrained occupants, pets, coke cans, etc become deadly when they are flyin around the car @ 120km/hr  to suggest seatblets dont work is kinda like saying 50 years of automotive safety engineering was all a scam and that ""I"" know better than the entire auto community..  take care wear your seatbelt!"
