633913,Aaron Shirley,2011-10-25 02:57:00,655,"Frank DiMarcantonio kicks my butt and puts on a show for me nailing smallies. I did catch fish too, but he was on fire. I'm not real strong on drop shotting technique, but I'm getting better now. You can watch our day in full 1080p HD on YouTube  Frank explains how to tie a drop shot rig in detail and shares his secrets too  Enjoy  Good fishing!  Aaron"
634008,Court R,2011-10-25 14:34:00,213,Very nice Aaron!
634198,Hooked,2011-10-26 00:19:00,891,"Some good tips by you and Frank.  I just started getting into drop shotting this year and I always use the stand-out drop shot hooks, now I know how to keep a regular hook perpendicular to the line. That tip by you with the weight was good too, think Frank lost 2 weights in the first 3 minutes of the ep. Thanks.  I remember when you and Barry did a show fishing for crappie in a little creek, thinking about doing another at that creek?  Anyways, good stuff."
634203,zeeter,2011-10-26 00:31:00,92,Great video.  I mostly fish Erie with tubes and haven't drop-shotted too much.  I think setting the hook the way Frank said will help a lot.
634211,Aaron Shirley,2011-10-26 00:47:00,655,"Thanks Court. Yeah, Frank took me to school that day! I went back recently with 6lb fluorocarbon spooled up and was lighter on my hookset. The end result, I lost very few fish   I will not use braid for drop shotting again, and I'll leave the Roland Martin hooksets for tubin' it   I have no plans for crappies in a small creek. I try to do something different all the time. I tried to do a panfish episode in the general area at a pond with a young guy this spring, but weather didn't cooperate. I plan to try again this coming spring."
634226,Dan668,2011-10-26 01:23:00,1120,"What kind of rods were you guys using? Im looking to buy a new one. It looks like they were pretty long, i want to upgrade from my 6'8.  The weight tip was great. I also used to use braid and found i lost more. I use 6lb fluoro too now, the line does twist more imo. I also forget half the time and do a huge hookset"
634380,Grimace,2011-10-26 15:12:00,2020,I am just starting to mess around with the drop shot.  I do not bass fish very often but I m trying to add it to my arsenal.   I was using braid with a leader and lost lots of fish as well.  Good tips thanks.
634392,Peps,2011-10-26 16:13:00,191,"VMC makes a hook for drop shotting,called the ""Spinshot"" it has an integrated swivel in the eye of the hook, hook spins freely 360 degrees and you never have to worry about line twist again!!!    Peps"

634481,Peps,2011-10-26 19:18:00,191,  your telling me!!! they won best for terminal tackle at icast this year with that simple design
634487,bucktail,2011-10-26 19:32:00,1857,That is a great idea!! Are they available yet?
634493,myot,2011-10-26 19:38:00,131,   Used those hooks over the Thanksgiving long weekend and they are by far the best dropshot hook I have fished they work unbelivealbly well and the hooks are razor sharp   Dan
634506,Peps,2011-10-26 20:10:00,191,  yes sir
634611,Aaron Shirley,2011-10-27 00:03:00,655,"Danbob, the drop shot rods we used were 6'9"" long medium light power with a fast action. That is the standard drop shot rod.  Those VMC hooks are sweet! I have to get some of those. What a simple design. Does anyone know if they come in black nickel?"
634645,Dan668,2011-10-27 01:55:00,1120,Thx aaron. Looked longer in the video lol. I like the look of these. I prefer gamakatsu hooks over vmc. I think these are coming out soon too.  http://texasfishingforum.com/forums/ubbthreads.php/topics/6378962/1
634685,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-10-27 08:46:00,1107,Hey Aaron I haven't watched the vid my laptops not liking the 1080P but when I dropshot I use a 7'MH fast action 20lb braid with a 10lb flouro leader and I don't pin them all but I don't miss a lot either and I set the hook like I'm flipping every time LOL in tourneys were smallies are boss we usually fish 1 with tubes and 1 dropshotting last year(2010) was tubes over drop shot and this year was dropshot taking more fish   I guess it's what ever your confident with and I'm not a fan of draggin tubes so I have got lots of confidence in my dropshot set up so it works good for me.
635080,David Chong,2011-10-28 02:24:00,836,"The Spin Shot Rig was actually developed by  Bernard Yong Set from Stringease. Stringease has the Zero Twist Shot drop shot hook which is exactly the same as the VMC version but also incorporates a #14 stainless steel crane swivel which is rated at 3o lbs. test. I've was in on the development of these 2 products and have been using the Zero Twist Shot all summer with great success! It takes the twist all out of your fluorocarbon! The VMC Spark Point is a black nickel hook which is super sharp & strong. Aaron, if we bump into each other on Erie I'll toss you a package! The Zero Twist Shot is readily available at most tackle stores in Ontario!"
635085,David Chong,2011-10-28 02:28:00,836,"Here is a picture of the Stringease Zero Twist Shot drop shot hook!They are available in sizes 8,6,4,2,1 & 1/0 They're going to be great for ice fishing as well! "
635402,Aaron Shirley,2011-10-28 22:12:00,655,"David, that is awesome! Well done. Funny, when I first saw the above image, I thought to myself, that looks like something that Bernard would come up with    That guy never stops thinking!  I'll be out on Erie a lot in November, maybe I'll see ya out there.  Good fishing!  Aaron"
635428,Live2fish85,2011-10-28 23:57:00,1633,Hey Aaron you cant get those hooks that David Chong showed from Fishing world I am not sure if Greg has them at Bill's Bait. They do work well on Erie though.
