331360,jediangler,2009-04-18 01:01:00,1923,That's a good looking dog you got there. I had mine out in the kayak today to see how she would be. She is almost 6 months and was a little nervous to start. After awhile she relaxed and enjoyed watching the ducks and turtles. 
331421,Angler16,2009-04-18 03:36:00,188,"Glad to hear it! The dog i got wont be here because hes not old enough yet.He has to get a vet check on the 31st of april then ill have him around may 10th! When i take the annual trip up to nipissing i would love nothing more for my dog to come out with us on the boat,but no dogs so we have to leave him with a friend who lives in washago by the black river i think."
