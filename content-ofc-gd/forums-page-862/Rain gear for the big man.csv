331931,keepinitreel,2009-04-19 16:58:00,15,Does anyone know of a place near hamilton that sells rain gear in large sizes 3xl 4xl? I have looked all over and cant find a thing that fits. thanks
331933,Canuck2fan,2009-04-19 17:13:00,1444,If you are looking for summer weight rain gear I would highly recommend getting Frog Toggs fisherman series. I needed a 3X so that I could also wear my fishing vest UNDER my rain gear (I used to hate having all the gear in the vest get wet) whenever it rained.  I ordered my set off ebay for under 30.00 Canadian total but that was back when the dollar was strong. I don't know where you can get them locally in 3X as bass pro only goes up to 2X on the website. Cabelas in the U.S. does sell them in 4X
331944,GBW,2009-04-19 17:54:00,8460,have you tried Home Depot?  I don't know how big they go but I got a decent set there.
331950,Fang,2009-04-19 18:08:00,1330,Marks work warehouse!!!  good selection of product in store. I see 3x and 4xl there often. Usually back in against the work clothes

332483,bigugli,2009-04-20 14:17:00,6138,There aren't too many places that carry 'bear' sized clothing. last time I went hunting for rain gear someone suggested I visit a tent maker
