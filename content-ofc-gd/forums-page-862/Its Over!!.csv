331455,SlowPoke,2009-04-18 11:07:00,2984,"TJ was very well behaved; I left a beer on the table when I went out for smoke and it was still there when I got back. OMG, he's finally drunk himself blind! Thanks for the beer Dave, thanks for the 1.8 tip JP but most of all thanks to Subway for keeping these guys off the streets for another night. -Brian"
331462,danbouck,2009-04-18 11:54:00,4380,"It was a great time! It was great sharing some stories with everyone and having a drink with Dave, JP and some OFNers. T.J. I had to share your poop story with my wife this morning, I am still laughing"
331471,kickingfrog,2009-04-18 13:29:00,8333,So how do we get Barrie on the map for next years tour?  How's that for subtlety?
331481,TJQ,2009-04-18 14:04:00,7806, I'm sure Subway will see the overwhelming success of these events and schedule more!!
331482,bigfish1965,2009-04-18 14:07:00,3382,"I hope so...I blew a rad hose about 1/4 of the way there..let my CAA expire, too. ARRGGHH!! Looks like I missed a damm good time..."
331484,kickingfrog,2009-04-18 14:17:00,8333,  Hopefully before they see the food bill.
331487,Spiel,2009-04-18 14:36:00,9065,Those that missed it missed plenty. Great show put on by great people and the chance to spend time chatting over a few cold ones with TJ and Monique as well has old and new friends from OFC and of course the hosts of the Facts of Fishing seminars and their generous friends at Subway was well the the price of admission....FREE  I know I'm glad I changed my mind and went!
331509,douG,2009-04-18 16:01:00,2693,"TJ is posting again while under the affluence, good times.  Kudos to Mercer, de Rose, and those fine fine Subway folks.  I'm sure a great time was had by all.  Time to take that show on the road, Tref."
331526,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-18 18:04:00,2050,"It was nice seeing you guys, even though I had to peace out early due to the fact that my wife was ""dielated"" (he hasn't been born yet) and the bay's callin' my name so I'm outta here! lol  Off to the lake until the wee-one decides he's ready to come on out and meet us.  Cheers, Ryan"
331571,JPD,2009-04-18 20:43:00,296,"It was great meeting you guys last night and thank you very much for coming out to support the event. Sorry we had to go but I was absolutely whooped by the the end of it and had to get up this morning to head out to Gagnon's for a seminar.  Rick, sorry to hear about your car trouble it would have been great to meet you and as for the rest of the bunch it was really nice to put some faces to the names, I enjoyed meeting you guys last night.  JP"
331575,Dave Mercer,2009-04-18 21:02:00,148,Thank You All!  It was a great tour and I was amazed by the crowds! Thank you all so much for coming out it was great to see you all! Yet again it just goes to show how awesome OFC'ers are!!!  Dave Mercer
331580,JohnF,2009-04-18 21:29:00,3494,"Sorry I couldn't make it as I'd told Ryan I would, but business stuff got in the way. Believe me, I'd much rather have been emptying beer bottles and scarfing back Subs with y'all than doin' what I wuz doin'. Mebbe next time. And Ryan, don't get too far out on the bay. Ya never know when nature will call and you'll have to make a kwik trip to the baby doc. All the best with that.  JF"
