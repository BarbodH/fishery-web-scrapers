331745,mikeh,2009-04-19 03:14:00,824,I just noticed Gagnon's in Oshawa is having a sale and saw some pretty good deals here's the link. gagnon's sale
331761,crappieperchhunter,2009-04-19 03:44:00,2582,"Used to really look forward to there spring sale. $1 to spool a reel...never missed it...dating back to when they where still located on Simcoe South. I don't really need anything but I used to go for that and then ""donate"" money for other stuff while I was there.  No more $1 a spool. So no more donations either. Too bad. I always liked getting a ""DEAL"" and ""Supporting"" them. Now I can just go somewhere else when it is convenient instead of waiting for an ""Event"".  Natalie are you listening?"
332495,fishermccann,2009-04-20 14:35:00,655,"I agree, the last few years  have been a pale imitation of earlier tent sales,."
332498,Stoty,2009-04-20 14:42:00,2910,"Darn, I wish I knew about this sale!! $8 off powerpro...man oh man!"
332503,crappieperchhunter,2009-04-20 14:55:00,2582,"Stoty not sure if it is just a local Cdn Tire or all of them, but I got powerpro at a Oshawa Cdn Tire..Taunton Rd.... for $10 off a spool last week. Might be worth looking into."
332506,Stoty,2009-04-20 14:59:00,2910,Oh really? I just checked on Cdn Tire's website and it doesnt have it listed as being on sale. DARN!!!
332517,tinbanger,2009-04-20 15:16:00,1028,  Don't worry they probably wouldn't have it in stock either! TB
332520,Stoty,2009-04-20 15:19:00,2910,"HAHAHAHA, dont even get me started!!!!"
332523,irishfield,2009-04-20 15:27:00,26272,I was gonna say.. I didn't think you shopped there anymore Jamie !!
332526,crappieperchhunter,2009-04-20 15:32:00,2582,Like I said didn't know if it was a advertised sale or not. I went in looking for grass seed and had to do the mandatory cruise through the fishing section while I was there. Quite often...in the Oshawa stores anyway... they have unadvertised stuff that they are practically giving away. Getting rid of old stock or discontinued stuff I guess. So I always browse around a bit while I am there.
