332125,Nemo,2009-04-20 00:04:00,727,Hmm bit early I'd say......
332158,Bernie,2009-04-20 00:31:00,3190,"Usually I get at least one fish shack floor or a top of a dock drift in to my place each season, never a whole one. It has supplied me with enough lumber for several projects over the years. Makes up for all the garbage and other crap that ignoramuses leave on the ice."

332576,Viscount,2009-04-20 17:40:00,52, I doubt we'd be that lucky. Should still report it though.
