We set up camp and about 5 mins i had my first hit!! reeled in a little bit and fish on! not a huge cat but ill take it! We were getting hits all night but they never took the bait just played with it. Then the brother in law shows up and i set him up and in about a hr he was fighting a big cat but lost it. The wind started to get cold and strong and i look over at the wifes rod and she gets a huge hit. she told me to grab the rod and i held on it for a while till one big pull almost pulled my rod out of my hand. I set the hook and the line started to scream i handed the rod over to the brother in law and boy he was having fun! Had a blast out there and cant wait to get some more! maybe one day rich will get off his ass and come out there with me!
