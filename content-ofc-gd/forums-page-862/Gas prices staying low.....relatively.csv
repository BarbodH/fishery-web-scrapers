332397,pigeonfisher,2009-04-20 11:19:00,696,Didn't you put your shovel away early?  hahahahah
332398,Billy Bob,2009-04-20 11:22:00,5865,Now you don't it. The jinx is on and prices will soon rise.......
332426,BillM,2009-04-20 12:47:00,17367," I just wish our prices matched the price of gas in the US.  I was down in Florida last week, $2.03 a gallon.  Even with the crappy exchange rate, we'd be better off buying it down there."
332428,CLofchik,2009-04-20 12:58:00,854,Don't forget the rise last year was entirely due to speculators playing with paper oil. As long as Wall Street stays pummeled they don't have the cash to play games.
332429,holdfast,2009-04-20 12:58:00,1813," We""ll see Lew come Victoria Day Weekend.  I know Historically the prices will rise like fire.  On the same note, our price is holding at 94.9.  Not bad at $50 a Barrel.  Also I'm beginning to think that  Dan McTeague is an oil Speculator ( Probably not, but the Gougers are using him to their advantage).  Just like Clockwork his last announcement shot prices up within hours after he stated the Suncor merge would drive them up."
