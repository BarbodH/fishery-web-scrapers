331949,Radnine,2009-04-19 18:08:00,1538,"Hi Dudes, I have a lawn mower and a weed whipper that are both victims of old gas. Does anyone know if there is a product that I can spray down the carb to de-gunkify it before putting in fresh gas? I am thinking back to the days when a can of ""ether"" would start anything and keep it going long enough to start sucking gas. Is there such a thing or am I looking at taking them to bits and cleaning? Thanks, Jim"

331974,BillM,2009-04-19 19:08:00,17367, You forgot to tell him about the massive amounts of smoke his lawnmower will be spewing with this stuff.   I wouldn't bother.  Carb cleaner works fine.  Or you can use the choke to keep things running until fresh gas gets in there.
331978,Fisherman,2009-04-19 19:23:00,7201,"The problem is he has old gas in the tank, hose and carb..inside the inner workings of the carb.  Shooting carb cleaner down the throat will clean just that, not where the jet, float/needle are located and all of the other tiny passages.  ""Degunkifying"" a carb requires removal, dissasembly, cleaning and assembly.  Then drain the tank and hose.  Probably wouldn't hurt to clean the tank too.  Didn't take the 5 minutes last fall..."
