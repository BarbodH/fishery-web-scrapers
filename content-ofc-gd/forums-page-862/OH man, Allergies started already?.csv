So I decided to stock up on catfish from the stores that farm them. I have seen the nastiness of some cats that swim in ponds and lakes I didn't think I would even try them.       My nose started running a few days ago non-stop.  So here they are enjoying my balcony and the fresh air. Waiting to suck up all my allergies.  Usually she makes two every other day but now I'm getting sick of it so once per week as needed. $1.39 LB for the small cats, that what these ones are. $1.99lb for the mediums.  dsn"
