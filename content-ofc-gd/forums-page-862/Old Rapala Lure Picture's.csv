331926,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-19 16:50:00,3761,"was at my grandparents house yesterday and in the basement I found a old Rapala lure, still in the box never used, instructions on how to use it also with the price tag with a ($1.85)  I thought it was pretty cool, and this bait looks very similar to the lures rapala makes today. Any clue on how old it might be?"
331927,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-19 16:53:00,0,no clue on the age but that's pretty neat.  i certainly hope it never hits the water.
331928,kickingfrog,2009-04-19 16:54:00,8333,"Very nice!  The original floater probably hasn't changed much, but the box might give a better indication of the era."
331934,kemper,2009-04-19 17:22:00,2232,Mike is it the 7G...Finland stamped on the belly?
331940,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-19 17:45:00,3761," Sorry i thought I had the 3rd picture up Kemper, it's the 9G with the Finland stamp on the bottom. Take a look."
331941,dave524,2009-04-19 17:47:00,4508,"Remember buying a Rapala in a box like that at Tower's in St Catharines, they were new in Canada and were getting rave reviews, I was in high school and $2 was a lot for a lure, would have been mid sixties."
332070,Squid,2009-04-19 22:04:00,1656,70's
332075,Fudd,2009-04-19 22:22:00,94,"I would think that floater is from mid 70's. To bad it is not blue, was my fav lure for a few decades."
332080,kemper,2009-04-19 22:34:00,2232,"  Thanks Mike, I have one from a similar year but it is the 7G. I was interested because I have never seen the box for one."
332090,dave524,2009-04-19 22:54:00,4508,"The original Rapala's came in gold or silver, blue came along later. Normark , Canada was founded in 1965 according to this.  http://books.google.ca/books?id=nimoGOo2GP...lt&resnum=1"
332096,Fudd,2009-04-19 23:05:00,94,"If my memory serves me correct(prolly not), the 60's rapala's were in a greenish box, and in the 70's they went to the baby blue. I maybe wrong though, that is many moon's ago."
332124,bucktail,2009-04-20 00:04:00,1857,"The mint condition box and packaging makes it a really nice find, keep it in good condition!!"
332212,BassAsin,2009-04-20 01:18:00,806,haha i've been tossin 40 year old fred arbogast and rapala lures for a few years now grandfather gave me an old tickle trunk full of them.
332364,profisher25,2009-04-20 04:11:00,185,"$ 1.85 .. yea its definitely old,  wow though, what a classic. My uncle has the same lure. Definitely an Original Floater. I wouldn't use it though, its too much of a classic to be used. Keep it a virgin Mike lol"
332372,MillerPhoto,2009-04-20 05:07:00,147,"Read through the instructions, sometimes there is a year in small print somewhere.. im guessin about 85-88 thou. ive seen similar before.."
332378,OhioFisherman,2009-04-20 05:59:00,6623,My guess is mid 60`s to early 70`s bought them often in the same style packaging.
332405,lew,2009-04-20 11:46:00,12766,"Fishing lures are meant to be used and your Grandfather somehow forgot to put this one to use, so now it's your turn to do what he didn't.  Tie it on your fish'n pole and and go catch a biggun with it & make your Granfather proud..  A good piece of fishing gear does nobody any good sitting on the mantle collecting dust."
332650,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-20 20:24:00,3761," I thought about using it but like i don't know...I never really owned anything old like this and well, i don't want to snag it...maybe i'll keep it in the tackle box for that perfect cast on the perfect lake one day."
