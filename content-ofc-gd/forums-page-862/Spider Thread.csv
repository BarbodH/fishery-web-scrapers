I am told by an inside source that this is basically the same as Power Pro except that it is softer and contains more fibres. The supplier is Red Wing Tackle and it is available in BPS as well as most other places where line can be had. Red Wing Tackle sells some good stuff so I am hoping that this is comparable. I will be giving it a try this year to compare, I hope it is as good or better. This is just a heads up to something new, I'm not plugging anyone. If the mods prefer to remove, that's ok.  Stan"
331999,River Rat,2009-04-19 20:25:00,161,"well, REDWING was the importer / distributor for POWERPRO until very recently  1 + 1 = 2  RR"
332008,fishinfool,2009-04-19 20:37:00,366, True and now they have decided to push their own line. Here is a link Re: the sale of Power Pro http://www.saltwatersportsman.com/article/...ro-fishing-line
332058,Mark Kulik,2009-04-19 21:45:00,348,SpiderThread will be my braid of choice this year-I tested it on catfish and it worked great -casts nice also!
332060,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-19 21:48:00,3761,"oops, thought you ment spider wire.  Sorry no input from me dude."
332261,eyefish,2009-04-20 02:04:00,135,Like mark said I've used it as well and didn't find any difference...The individual fibres of spider thread are in fact smaller in diamenter than power pro...so if my math is correct that would mean there would be more fibers in it than the same diameter of power pro....hence it would be stronger...no?
332341,Garnet,2009-04-20 03:20:00,2056,Spider Thread has no wax but is the same dia. so more spectra. This is why it lays on the spool much nicer and is way better for spool lock.  Lets not make this to technical spool lock is when the line wraps in the spool and you lose rod reel and musky bait.  Garnet

I've been trying to get the scoop, but I haven't gotten a chance too yet.    My good fishing buddy sells line for Barry and Paul and fishes a lot of tournaments with them. I'm hoping he will get me some of this stuff to try out. LOL"
