I stripped everything out of it as you can see from the before pictures.  Click on the pictures to see a larger picture.    So I added tackle storage (holds 18 stow away boxes), rod box (holds 12 rods), livewell (30x12x12 custom welded aluminum), casting deck and a 24V trolling motor.  Here are the after pictures    Was a great project, learned a lot!"

332087,tknohpy,2009-04-19 22:47:00,162,Thanks!  Yes it has a 500 GPH pump feeding the livewell
