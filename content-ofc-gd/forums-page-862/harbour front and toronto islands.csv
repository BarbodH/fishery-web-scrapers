331734,irishfield,2009-04-19 02:54:00,26272,You sure about that... since Toronto Harbour is only mentioned in the Zone 20 exemptions for using two lines??
331736,rbaquial,2009-04-19 02:58:00,968,"...I guess it depends on where your line is being thrown... if towards the actual LAKE of LAKE ONTARIO... then Z20... but if your on ""land"" but fishing a body of water connected to L. Ontario... then I think Z16? Now you have me double-thinking this...."
