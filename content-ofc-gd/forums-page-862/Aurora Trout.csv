I have heard from a friend of mine in Blindriver that the trout have once again been decimated. Now this guy has a major tendency to Bull a bit so. Can anyone confirm or have first hand knowledge of this?? What happened ??? i can not find anything on the net about this at all."
332273,kickingfrog,2009-04-20 02:15:00,8333,Outdoor Canada or Ontario out of doors just had an article about Aurora trout. Maybe check their sites.
332275,irishfield,2009-04-20 02:20:00,26272,Season actually (stayed) opened this year in Zone 11.. Liberty Lake North of Temagami this year... so there must be enough there for the pressure.  Had been closed in the years prior...
332277,Fudd,2009-04-20 02:22:00,94,  Was it no catch and release?August to Oct again? and thanks for the update Irish.
332282,irishfield,2009-04-20 02:26:00,26272,You must retain your Aurora... and then you're done for the day !
332296,Fudd,2009-04-20 02:37:00,94,"Thanks mate, so still no catch and release, thank gawd. The survival rate on them is about 25% with a release. You are a wealth of info thanks a heap."
332298,BassAsin,2009-04-20 02:43:00,806,beat me to it Wayne hahahha  it sure does suck when you see a 4 pounder comin at it and a 2 pounder flies in and smacks it!
332388,solopaddler,2009-04-20 10:39:00,8605,"If you're talking about the original Aurora lakes, Whitepine & Whirlygig I have no idea. Truly hope they havn't been acidified again... The MNR stocked lakes that are open to fishing on a rotational basis are all healthy.. Sadly there's never been any documented natural reproduction in any of those lakes (at least that's what I was told). Entirely put and take...  Perhaps if you've had a hand in the original lakes rehab the MNR would be willing to answer your questions about the lakes. That's where I'd go looking for answers."
332464,Viscount,2009-04-20 13:50:00,52,"The Aurora Trout lakes that open on a rotating basis were all closed for a couple seasons because of the Aurora's inclusion on the Environment Ministry's new ""Species at Risk"" campain. They sorted it out and the season has been re-opened on the put&take lakes for the last three years.  The lakes where they naturally reproduce (ie: whitepine, whiligig) were ""limed"" many years ago to neutralize the affects of acid rain and I read something somewhere that the pH is dropping again slowly and they may have to look into liming it again in the future.  As far as I know they haven't taken any action so far, so I wouldn't worry about it too much. By the sounds of it, they keep a close eye on them.  K"
332475,TJQ,2009-04-20 13:58:00,7806,"Funny thing is, I am having Justin Work on an extensive article on this subject!!"
332569,Viscount,2009-04-20 17:33:00,52," The intent for the 9 lakes they have was purely for fishery and tourism. Other than the two lakes mentioned, the others where they reproduce aren't public knowledge."
