331848,smokin joe,2009-04-19 13:45:00,226,  Terry do you put these on the body harness and let them retrieve the fish for you?  Looks like a golden retriever to me
331850,JohnF,2009-04-19 13:54:00,3494, I think Terry's bait looks a lot more appealing. The scowl on this one would scare off anything less than a big shark. Reminds me of the look on my wife's face when I pass gas in the family room.  JF
332151,Terry,2009-04-20 00:26:00,14456,that is one mean looking bait
332366,profisher25,2009-04-20 04:17:00,185,"I believe it is true, perhaps not so much for muskie fishing though. I have read articles of live dogs and cats being used (which I am STRONGLY AGAINST as well) as bait for shark fishing."
332367,profisher25,2009-04-20 04:20:00,185,"   I found that muskrat lure you mentioned about!  http://cgi.ebay.com/Weber-Papa-Muskrat-Mus...%3A1%7C294%3A50  I've heard of these lures, but i've never actually seen one.   I'm definitely going to have to get my hands on one of these lures. .. If not, ill just make one with my old rubber duckling... just add some spinner blades at the bottom, and I have a big treble hook that is currently not being used at the moment."
332368,xeon,2009-04-20 04:26:00,350, Your telling me you dont use dogs when shark fishing? Talk about an exciting bite! Best setup is to use a blue and gold board with a large dog. Heres some pictures from last season.  
331097,GBW,2009-04-17 04:14:00,8460,for sure!  when you twitch them the ears make a huge splash and gets the musky to go gunning for them.  but I still love my chipmunks whit those huge tails (let's you get a trailer hook in place).
331134,Marc Thorpe,2009-04-17 10:31:00,621,"  Terry,just a piece of advice on canine use,you will get more wiggle out of a Dodson! only thing is you have to use 3 trebles because of the profile of the bait You will see a definite increase in size of fish also"
331152,tonyb,2009-04-17 12:42:00,1637,Two words...Hammy Harness! 
331180,bigfish1965,2009-04-17 13:57:00,3382,can you get the hammy harness in flouro?
331213,muskymatt,2009-04-17 16:25:00,2608,  Yes cats do plow thru the water but if you use kittens and inject them with air like with worms they retreive better when casting them.
331222,kemper,2009-04-17 17:06:00,2232,TJ let us know when P3TA is in your yard...
331225,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-04-17 17:12:00,0,"Crackheads would work also, they do uncontrollable jerking on there own, so you wouldnt have to work them as hard, might be too much movement in cold water though"
331233,express168,2009-04-17 17:31:00,327, Now that is FUNNY!
331328,xeon,2009-04-17 23:29:00,350,"Last summer they were hitting on orange, and I did however go through a few litters of black ones on St.Clair... bad luck my ass.  I personally only use dipsy divers when Im trolling kittens. I just cant stand to see them struggle at the surface its inhumane. Only problem is you have to switch bait every few minutes.  But needless to say the girls at the local humane society love me because I adopt all the poor homeless kitties."
331351,JohnF,2009-04-18 00:29:00,3494," Well, what a relief to finally find someone here with the milk of human kindness in their hearts. These other hardhearted animals just drag the little furry critters along the surface, the poor hairy little guys gasping and fighting for a breath, no remorse, no compunctions at all. You are my kinda man .. keep the suffering out of sight.  JF"
331354,Terry,2009-04-18 00:43:00,14456,"well I get mine from the humane society's last minute club, the ones that if not adopted out by 9 they put down, so they give them to me just to save the cost of the needle to put them to sleep, it's a shame that they spade or neuter them first but hey, they were going to die anyway"
331355,xeon,2009-04-18 00:57:00,350,"Oh and I forgot to add:  DONT DUMP YOUR BAIT BUCKETS IN THE WATER!  It sickens me to see people just dump their bait at the waters edge, do the right thing. Throw your unused bait in the dumpster and help keep invasive species out of our waters!"
331356,JohnF,2009-04-18 00:58:00,3494, Don't the neutered ones kick as hard under water?   .... not that I blame them.....  JF
331365,xeon,2009-04-18 01:08:00,350, Absolutly not. The unnudered males that are in heat growl WAY more and I think the fish are attracted to that. Trick is though you have to show him a female right before you cast him out.
331374,JohnF,2009-04-18 01:41:00,3494," Contrary to what Dave Mercer says, that's why we buy big minnow buckets. You need some kitten hotties to turn on the bait.  JF"
331381,GBW,2009-04-18 01:52:00,8460,"Can't wait till next weekend, I know of a beaver dam right were all the trout are so I know what I'll be doing next weekend.  Playing with big beavers for big fish!"
331412,holdfast,2009-04-18 02:59:00,1813,"Its a fact.  Just dont tell my wife where her dog went.  Poor Red, still not found    "
331644,Dara,2009-04-18 23:55:00,3052," OK, now this I gotta try    Oh yeah...kinda like a worm harness...only different     So you can just pull in there with the boat behind you, Muskie rods poking up with biga$$ed trebles hanging off em and say...ya, gimme a dozen of the mixed colours, or, since its cloudy today ya think black may work better?"
331657,JohnF,2009-04-19 00:36:00,3494, So if ya decide to try the black ones ... remember not to let them cross yer path. That's worse than a banana in the boat.  JF
331725,xeon,2009-04-19 02:34:00,350, LOL a dozen! HAHAHA How many fish do you expect to catch with a dozen kittys? Try 2-3 hundred per trip then you might be out there for more than 5 minutes.  A dozen... HA.
331731,dave524,2009-04-19 02:49:00,4508,Going back 40 years they used to sell a plastic duckling lure with a couple of spinner blades for feet and some trebles on it. Believe there was also a muskrat looking lure as well.   Edit: found a pic of the duckling  http://cgi.ebay.com/CREE-DUK-VINTAGE-BROWN...%3A1%7C294%3A50
331735,holdfast,2009-04-19 02:55:00,1813," Yup, I might of seen the same thing.  A Rodent, with metal wings to make it Gurgle."
331819,bigugli,2009-04-19 12:36:00,6138,We had a swimming muskrat bait. Don't know if it ever caught anything more than my uncle at the store
331823,Terry,2009-04-19 12:46:00,14456,"here's the built in bait holder on my boat   I like big eyes on my baits, it seems to draw the bite to them         "
331841,Terry,2009-04-19 13:40:00,14456,"here is a good top water, works best with a fast retrieve     "
330922,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-16 21:48:00,3761,"I have heard of people using small rodents even small cats for musky fishing. Now this is that I have heard over the years, like people trolling a cat or a live mouse or something. So my question is, is there any truth to these tales that people and myself have heard about.  IMO if this tale was to be true i would 100% against it."
330928,Terry,2009-04-16 21:55:00,14456,"cats kind of plow through the water and drown quickly  rats are ok but mice are too small, they are ok for bass thrown over Lilly pads  I hear that muskrats are the best, but I have not been able to catch any to use them you must remember to use elastic bands to hold the hooks rather then hooking through the skin, they wiggle real well if skin hooked but die quickly or rip the skin and get away cats you can hook on their collar if they have one, make sure you have a trailer treble hook for short biters small dogs may be best of all, but it's too easy to get attached to them, long haired dogs work well Chihuahua are the perfect size and the constant barking/yapping some people believe draws the muskie in from great distances, I have not been lucky with them myself"
330932,purekgw,2009-04-16 22:03:00,585,LMAO is that where my cat went?
330933,irishfield,2009-04-16 22:08:00,26272,F-in-law has a shitzu (sp) with a nice flat face. Makes great splashes on the tug and jerk.. so far no luck with this top water though..
330934,Terry,2009-04-16 22:11:00,14456,"I haven't tried one of them yet but I can see how it would be a great top water bait, like a chugger or popper"
330936,e-z-out,2009-04-16 22:15:00,1052,LOL you 2 old men always trying new things
330938,Terry,2009-04-16 22:18:00,14456,"well as you know cats didn't work on the niagara last Dec, I still think the water was too cold for it, so it didn't swim, the 10mh current could have something to do with it too"
330939,bigugli,2009-04-16 22:22:00,6138,Boathouse mice were always great pike bait back in the day. One heck of a surface strike when you let them swim.
330944,Roy,2009-04-16 22:51:00,13728,This was the hot  bait on the Larry last year. 
330959,GBW,2009-04-16 23:36:00,8460,"chipmunks work wonders and we have a lot at our place, well...we did..."
330963,irishfield,2009-04-16 23:41:00,26272,Mike... none of this stuff will matter if you don't fix the boat... you did fix the boat right??
330981,BillM,2009-04-17 00:25:00,17367,"Red squirrels are great, but they are a bugger to put on the hook."
330985,camillj,2009-04-17 00:26:00,1988,one word ..... ducklings ....
330989,Terry,2009-04-17 00:32:00,14456,"the problem with ducklings is when wild ones are the perfect size, muskie aren't in season yet and when muskie season is open the ducklings are too big for the area that I fish and king cole duck farms and other duck farms want too much for them, but when you get them watching the strike is great, make sure you set the hook fast cause they eat them fast and the hooks go deep"
330996,Roy,2009-04-17 00:43:00,13728,I've also heard of a dude in Boucherville who uses live lobsters as muskie bait.
330999,BassAsin,2009-04-17 00:47:00,806,you just gotta get a buddy with a chicken farm Terry! i can get my hands on small chicks all season long!
331000,JohnF,2009-04-17 00:51:00,3494," I've heard that if you use pitbull puppies you don't even need a hook, let alone worry about the set. Just work the bait close to a musky and the bait does all the work after that. Good idea to have a stretcher handy to rescue the musky from the bait after you land 'em.  JF"
331009,Weeds,2009-04-17 00:59:00,782,Savages.
331010,JohnF,2009-04-17 01:00:00,3494, That would definitely not be politically correct.  JF
331011,BassAsin,2009-04-17 01:01:00,806,how so they are very effective methods on angling large musky?
331020,Terry,2009-04-17 01:10:00,14456,LOL
331025,Weeds,2009-04-17 01:15:00,782,"I'm laughing too, hadn't really meant to actually suggest savages but hey...you never know till you try it I guess."
331027,tinbanger,2009-04-17 01:18:00,1028,We do have an old book around somewhere that the author talks about using cigar butts and womens bra ( 1/2 of it ) for pike !  TB
331057,bassman,2009-04-17 02:26:00,384,"I always thought kitties and mice was an urban legend, but a buddy mine who's not an avid angler and more the tree hugger type, went up to the cottage a few years back and asked the local bait shop owner what kind of bait he should buy to catch musky....the owner took him and his buddies to the back room and presented them with a box of kittens. To make a long story short, I don't think this owner has ""bait"" in his back room anymore, and the kitties found a good home."
331064,cram,2009-04-17 02:32:00,1733,little bunny wabbits are the best.
