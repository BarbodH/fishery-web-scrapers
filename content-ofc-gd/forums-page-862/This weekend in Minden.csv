I offered to come up and do what I can to help with the clean-up effort.  I will definitely be bringing some trout gear for some lakers that should still be in shallow...but am wondering what bodies of water might be around, and accessible.  I will have a canoe available as well...if anyone can help out I'd sure be glad to return the favour when called upon"
