332316,bigfish1965,2009-04-20 03:03:00,3382,Was just watching the CNN..lots of tornado warnings your (red)neck of the woods. Head for the basement or maybe grab a parachute and go for a ride..
332325,kickingfrog,2009-04-20 03:09:00,8333,"My understanding was that there are not a lot of basements in the south. Insert easy trailer park joke here_________.  Seriously though, I don't think there are a lot of basements. Scary stuff. Hold on tight dawg."
332332,Mike the Pike,2009-04-20 03:11:00,3421, I wonder if he has the boat and all fishing gear stored in his tornado shelter
332334,Greencoachdog,2009-04-20 03:14:00,8163,"yeah, they've been going off all night!... I don't pay them much mind, I'd rather keep an eye to the southwest window!  The 3 legged Border Collie is asleep at my feet and will let me know when it's time to head down to the basement!"

332345,Greencoachdog,2009-04-20 03:25:00,8163,"  ... yeah, that's a pretty fancy one for around these parts!!!  I usually just enlarge an Armadillo burrow for my ""basement""... shelter AND vittles!!!"
332346,kickingfrog,2009-04-20 03:27:00,8333," Nothing wrong with using what you have on hand, and it's not like it was a short bus.  Although I wonder why they felt the need to cover/remove the word school, but not the word bus?"
332348,irishfield,2009-04-20 03:28:00,26272,It was their hunting vehicle before the engine blew!!!  Sleep well Glen...
332355,ohhenrygsr,2009-04-20 03:39:00,947,if you need i can take care of your boat for ya
332357,Greencoachdog,2009-04-20 03:44:00,8163, I dunno if you can afford it Henry... it costs 50 cents (American) just to look at a picture of it!!!
332358,kickingfrog,2009-04-20 03:46:00,8333, And runs on pure shine.
332361,Greencoachdog,2009-04-20 03:49:00,8163,   ... or Nitro-Methane!!!
