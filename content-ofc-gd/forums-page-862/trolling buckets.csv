332206,tomO,2009-04-20 01:14:00,363,I'm assuming 5 gallon buckets tied with heavy rope on the handles and 5 or 6 feet of rope in the water. This came up a while back but I never thought to ask bucket size.
332224,Mike the Pike,2009-04-20 01:33:00,3421,yes 5 gallon buckets will work but be sure to drill a couple of 2 inch diameter holes at the bottom of the bucket.  Had a friend do this and it worked like a charm.
332226,Fisherman,2009-04-20 01:33:00,7201,"Yup, 5 gallon pail, 550 cord tied directly through a couple holes in the upper ring around the bucket. Poke a few 1 inch holes in the bottom, makes them track straighter."
332227,irishfield,2009-04-20 01:35:00,26272,All I did for the BOQ was take two pool clorine(sp) buckets (about 3 gallons at most).. remove the handles and drill a larger hole where they attached. Take a 10' rope for each bucket.. put thru each hole from inside to out and tie a knot. Take the now doubled rope and knot a loop at the end of it. Drop that over your side bow cleats and drop the buckets out the side. Out of the way and they work great.

332343,Cudz,2009-04-20 03:22:00,2652,IKEA bags.  Similar material to expensive drift socks but only cost $2 each.  Get 2 or 3 of them
