331157,MSBruno,2009-04-17 12:58:00,369,I am Royal Vic for work every once in a while and I am wondering if I can wash some lures and catch a pike or two from shore.  Possible?  Any tips or tricks?  Spots?  Thanks in advance!
331162,e-z-out,2009-04-17 13:12:00,1052,Don't think you can i've fished that lake and you would have to get out on a boat if you plan on hooking into a pike.
331193,tinbanger,2009-04-17 15:00:00,1028,bit tough without a boat . limited shoreline /dock access and verrryyy weedy.  Fairly resonable boat rentals are readily available.  TB
331334,Rizzo,2009-04-17 23:51:00,4754,you can try simcoe from shore
331361,Governator,2009-04-18 01:02:00,879,"I'd say you definitely need to rent a boat, there isn't much public access to the lake (it is little...).  Renting a boat is very cheap though especially if you can do it during the week."
331367,misfish,2009-04-18 01:13:00,29133,"Ok heres my input.Not that my friends hear, dont know what thier talking about.  You can park(just like everyone else doz) at the bridge on the 400,west side. Walk the trail to the lake.If you have waders, I recommend them.The bottom is sandy and you can walk a fair bit out.To the north of there you will find some deeper water and weeds that can be fished with a silver minnow or spinner."
331438,Cudz,2009-04-18 05:03:00,2652,This is true but you don't get that much area to fish.  To truly get into the lake you need a boat.  If you like catching little snot rockets then Little lake is your spot. Wait until late June early July and catch some big bass.
331441,misfish,2009-04-18 05:15:00,29133,"I,ll bet, if you had a boat(which you do),and I fished that area, (From shore)I get more then you.?WANT TO BET???????25 YEARS TELLS ME YOU LOSE."
331442,Cudz,2009-04-18 05:17:00,2652,I wouldn't fish that area.  22 years tells me there are better spots.
331567,tinbanger,2009-04-18 20:34:00,1028,I'll hold the money  But chances are Misfish may not even remember the bet  TB
331921,MSBruno,2009-04-19 16:40:00,369," snot rockets?  what are these?  hammer handles or smaller bass?  also, can someone be more specific on the parking spot and the way to walk to the lake?  I have waders."
331923,MSBruno,2009-04-19 16:42:00,369,  what will get me bites off fishing from shore?
331924,MSBruno,2009-04-19 16:44:00,369,Im on google earth trying to figure out the parking spot and path.  Can someone please explain?
331947,misfish,2009-04-19 18:03:00,29133," Yep   Just before the 400/69 extention,theres a bridge.You can park off the hwy on the west side.Just follow the river til you hit the lake.   Oh theres lots there.  lol"
331963,fishboy,2009-04-19 18:37:00,550,"curious...if you have a boat, where can you launch and how much $?"
331969,pikeie,2009-04-19 18:47:00,380,theres a trailer park on the lake that has a boat launch. it pretty cheap i think $5??? this trailer park also rents the boats for the lake cant remember what its called though...
331971,misfish,2009-04-19 18:52:00,29133, Ceder park
331998,spinnerbaitking,2009-04-19 20:23:00,1622,"They also have pontoon boats for rent for the day, we fished it last year with our boat and talked to the owner about renting the pontoon boats for our 4-H fishing club, nice people, about 6 campers were there all friendly Richard  Cedar Park Camp Ground‎ - 10 Little Lake Drive, Barrie, ON L4M 7C1, Canada‎ - (705) 721-4691‎"
