332278,Garry2Rs,2009-04-20 02:22:00,1425,There is some Chinese counterfit Power Pro going around. The boxes aren't very good. Here's some info from Shimano

332306,mbac31,2009-04-20 02:55:00,904,"Lots of this stuff going around. Not just line, fake LC cranks, Megabass and a few Lowrance and I have seen3 clone reels(Higher End). They have been doing it for years."

332317,BillM,2009-04-20 03:03:00,17367,I think the only person that might get fooled by that is Ray Charles..
332319,bigfish1965,2009-04-20 03:05:00,3382,There was counterfeit stuff a few years ago and the boxes were almost perfectly identical. i think they added a hologram after that.
