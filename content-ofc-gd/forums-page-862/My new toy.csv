332473,jediangler,2009-04-20 13:56:00,1923,That was a great deal you got there. Does it convert for solo use as well?
332494,juan96,2009-04-20 14:33:00,23,Of cause it could be solo Kayak.  Front seat can be moved backward for solo Kayaking.

332545,jediangler,2009-04-20 16:03:00,1923,You should come see us at yakfisher.net. We have a member who has a Pam 130T that he has pimped out with everything you can imagine. He even has a battery powered bilge pump to get rid of water that gets in from rain or high waves. We also have a virtual derby contest with great prizes.
