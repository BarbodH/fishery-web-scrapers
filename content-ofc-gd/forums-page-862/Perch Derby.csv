One of the boats was taking on water and cap sized in the harbour.  The anglers livewell was taking on water from a plug in it that failed.  Fortunately everyone was okay, really cold but okay.  (pictures to come this week).  The winning perch was a hair under a pound.  A real nice fish Richard managed to land from shore.    In the child division D.J. caught a shore fished perch that landed him in first place.      Another highlight of the day was a rainbow a local Hamilton angler landed in the corner of the boat launch.  Beautiful looking fish.       Thanks Guys."
