331948,Calender Don,2009-04-19 18:08:00,39,"I'm looking for a fishing charter for walleye in lake Erie for sometime in June for about 10-12 guys from work. Can some point me in the right direction, I'm from Hamilton. Thanks"
332079,Fishmaster,2009-04-19 22:33:00,920,I sent you a Pm ...June Walleye fishing on Lake Erie is not the best ....
332082,JPD,2009-04-19 22:35:00,296,"You can also try J&P Charters, Paul Powis is an amazing guide. www.jpfish.com"
332083,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-19 22:37:00,270,10-12 guys on a boat Damn you'll need a houseboat!
332093,Handlebarz,2009-04-19 22:57:00,3790,I know there is a boat here on LSC that is called the FISH TANK I dont know how many it holds but I can tell you I could not count all the pairs we saw on her the one day it must have been the Hawaiin Tropic tour there were so many pairs on there I forgot I was fishing. I think they are only on LSC but you will have to find a party sized boat for that many good luck out there.
332098,Fudd,2009-04-19 23:09:00,94,The dude that used to run Harpoon charters is top notch and can accommodate 10 fisherman nps. He is based out of Erieau (Rondeau). http://www.harpooncharters.com/
332132,Fishmaster,2009-04-20 00:10:00,920,Booking 2 boats from 1 captain is a much more fun way to spend your day out fishing and landing a lot more fish   between 5 or 6 guys on each boat ...I've done a lot of Bachelor Parties 2 and up to 6 boats all fishing the same area on the Lake shooting the breeze back and forth on the VHF and even a mini tourney between the boats makes for a great day out fishing ...just my 2 cents
332141,nancur373,2009-04-20 00:18:00,1211,I'd have to agree with Fishmaster.
332237,taper,2009-04-20 01:42:00,611,I'm sorry guys but I have to disagree with a few of you. You can limit out on walleye on a regular basis in June. You just have to go to the West end. Any one here that has been to Colchester in May or June can tell you this. I have been on three charters out of Colchester over the years and always caught our limit. It was a ton of fun and with the right captain he will show you every thing you need to duplicate the success for your self. Send me a pm if interested and I can get you in contact with a great charter operator.
332242,danbouck,2009-04-20 01:45:00,4380, and an amazing teacher!
332276,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-20 02:21:00,270,ok so I agree fishmaster is your best bet he is a winner when it comes to finding the fish!
332297,Dave Mercer,2009-04-20 02:38:00,148,Contact Paul at www.jpfish.com he is the best! I shot a show with him 27 fish in 3 hours!
332299,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-20 02:44:00,270,   is this the real Dave Mercer?  ...you did a report on JP fish did yah! ooh this could be borderline spam but for sure I recommend fishmaster he is a legend @
332342,spinnerbaitking,2009-04-20 03:21:00,1622,"Hey Dave that was a great show lots of Trout And Walleye, double & triple headers Richard"
332611,uglyfish,2009-04-20 19:09:00,981,"i can tell u first hand that fishmaster will provide u with a great day on the water and put u on fish! multiple boats is not an issue, he can arrange that and make sure u have a great day on the water!"
