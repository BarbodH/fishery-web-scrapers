332701,eyeforelle,2009-04-20 21:38:00,38,"So is this salmonella outbreak air born or do you have to intake a contaminated piece of fruit of vegetable to get it? I had the flu back in march and I was out for a solid week and a half with chills, headache, throat infection, fever, ect. Is this the same one?"
331874,bigfish1965,2009-04-19 14:41:00,3382,"Having just got over whatever this virus is, I found on the Health Canada website that a massive Salmonella outbreak is threatening North America. There was a Norwalk or Rotavirus outbreak occuring at the same time, but those results are being checked to see if they were also salmonella. Not a real threat to adults, but can be deadly to infants and seniors. Wash your hands!! I've got about 5% of staff out with it now and several friends."
331875,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-19 14:46:00,0,yikes!  thanks for the heads up! if everybody is sick it just gives me an excuse to hide out on the rivers.
331881,dsn,2009-04-19 14:57:00,1018,It shall not come near thee
331919,aniceguy,2009-04-19 16:31:00,1094,thanks for the warning....too bad it wasnt last week as I am just getting over a 10 day flu...I have in 40 yrs never been this sick
332129,musky_man,2009-04-20 00:08:00,159,"Rick,  The Salmonella O/B is massive is the sense that it is widespread; if we are talking about the same thing, it looks like it might be due to some sort of contaminated melons or possibly other fruit.  You are right that the very young, old and immunocompromised can get very sick."
332133,ccmtcanada,2009-04-20 00:10:00,7971,"I read this earlier today and felt fine.  Went to see a movie with my daughter and my throat started hurting.  Now it's on fire, have a headache and some congestion...."
332140,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-20 00:16:00,2050,"Been dealing with it for close to 3 weeks here.  My 2 year old and preggo wife had it pretty bad and I somehow, so far managed to dodge it.  My wife even spent 2 days in the hospital because it got so bad.  She was vomiting uncontrollably as well."
332163,Radnine,2009-04-20 00:35:00,1538,Was it one of those Disney flicks? They do the same thing to me. Jim
332168,ccmtcanada,2009-04-20 00:38:00,7971, LOL....I was a Disney flick...took my 7 year old daughter to see Hannah Montana
332176,irishfield,2009-04-20 00:44:00,26272,Maybe it was the $30 stop at the snack bar!!!!  Thanks for the heads up Rick and the confirm Mark... wife and daughter are both pretty much immunsnafu'd !
332209,douG,2009-04-20 01:16:00,2693,Virus / Bacteria Disambiguation needed.  Stat.
332246,bigfish1965,2009-04-20 01:47:00,3382,Both are prevalent right now douG. There were 30 confirmed cases of the salmonella carrou bacteria in canada and untold numbers of Norwalk/Rotavirus cases. But the symptoms are the same...and 90% of people don't need medical intervention. The only fruit I ate last week was a pineapple/strawberry salad from the grocery store/ I have no idea what I had...more likely the virus over the bacteria. We have placed extra sanitizer stations at work because so much of our staff are coming down ill.
332292,Greencoachdog,2009-04-20 02:34:00,8163,"Makes me feel a little better aboot being an obsessive compulsive hand washer eh!!!  ... During flu and virus season, keeps hands away from eyes, nose, and mouth... unless they've just been washed!!!  ... carry a ""U-Fillem"" spray bottle of moonshine with you whereever you go!!!  ... what isn't used up from killing germs is absorbed thru the skin and is quite a pleasant buzz!!! (apply to hands instead of painted surfaces... and make sure you have a designated driver!!!)"
332314,bigfish1965,2009-04-20 03:00:00,3382,"I've had your moonshine, dawg...it will absoltuley kill and virus, bacteria or stomach lining in comes in contact with."
332392,Chris,2009-04-20 10:48:00,405,"My wife has got us all using those sanitizer soaps all the time for the last few years. She keeps a dispenser in the car and when we come out of a store we all get a dab to wash our hands. Cheap insurance, however we all ended up with a mild cold a few weeks ago. Cliff the cold started with a scratchy throat, but it only lasts a few days. The cough lasts about a week tho'. Other than that we haven't been sick in over three years. Washing your hands is your biggest defense...."
332396,solopaddler,2009-04-20 11:10:00,8605,"Both myself and my 5 year old daughter have been hugging the toilet since Friday night. My little one threw up 15 times between Fri evening and Sat morning... Not a fun weekend especially with my wife away visiting her sister.  I brought her to emerg Sat morning as she was pretty dehydrated.. Wasn't much they could do, however they did speculate that we were victems of this viral outbreak.  Thank God my 2 year old son is okay, don't think I could've handled that as well..  Seems to be better this morning thankfully."
332399,douG,2009-04-20 11:22:00,2693,"Hope the family unit is on the mend, Mike.  Another help is to take some probiotics - overwhelm the nasty bacteria with the good ones.  They come in capsules that you can get from the drugstore or health food store, and are the same stuffs that you find in some yogurt."
332478,huey graphite,2009-04-20 14:08:00,362,With all the Vitamin C I get from the lime in my mexican-style beer......my immune system should withstand any virus
332487,fishermccann,2009-04-20 14:21:00,655,I work in  a Toronto long term care facility and we are under lock down quarintine . Have been since Thursday.
332577,steverowbotham,2009-04-20 17:59:00,1800,"I am also feeling the effects.  severe congestion, massive headache, dry/sore throat. brutal"
332583,solopaddler,2009-04-20 18:15:00,8605, Sounds rough but more like flu not salmonella.
332587,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-04-20 18:22:00,1362,"I've had a severe sore throat for 5 days now..it's so sore to swallow that my ears hurt when I do. It seems to get better and then severe again..I haven't had any headaches, but I'm pretty conjested now and the colour of what's coming out of my nose is disgusting!!...  I thought that I may have picked something up on the plane last week during business travel.  Are these the symtoms???????....  Thanks Rick!!"
332625,irishfield,2009-04-20 19:25:00,26272,Crips Steve..... that's just lack of Scotch while you were away..
332635,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-04-20 19:49:00,1362,"  LOL Wayne...I started to think it had something to do with the Busch beers I was putting back at the hotel lobby bar last Tuesday...  I can't ever remember having a sore throat this bad that has lasted for so long....brutal....hmmmmm, Scotch you say?....what a GREAT idea!!  Thanks!"
332637,irishfield,2009-04-20 19:52:00,26272,Now that you've let it progress to this stage... I'd suggest Sambuca or Drambui would fix you up pdq !
