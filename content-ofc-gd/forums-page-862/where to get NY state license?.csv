331499,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-18 15:07:00,10439,No need to go anywhere if you have last years license just go online.  NY Licensing  Or just look for the nearest Walmart in NY.
331506,uglyfish,2009-04-18 15:24:00,981,"dont have a license from last year, first time ever gettin an amercan license. but thanks"
331507,charlied,2009-04-18 15:25:00,584,"if you can't do that then search walmart.com and under locate store, type in 14303 or 14305 zip codes and that will give you the closest walmart to the border."
331517,bassfighter,2009-04-18 17:34:00,366,Walmart at Porter Road across the border sells them.  One line takes at least 2-3 weeks for you to get them.  Even first time applicants
