Much to the chagrin of my fiancee i have some real neat old stuff I keep on display.  I have my great uncles creel basket, a 1960s reel, and an original mitchell 300.  Here's my ol' shakespeare!  Share some pics folks! "
331937,kemper,2009-04-19 17:39:00,2232,"Yep. I have lots of tackle from the early 1900s onward, including two old steel rods with wooden handles and two old johnson? reels that I found in my great grandmother's basement when she passed. She was 93, and the gear was her fathers, so needless to say its old stuff."
331945,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-19 17:57:00,0,i would love to see pics of some of that.
331946,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-19 18:00:00,3761,"Wow, old reel indeed. I also picked up some older rods by a name that i dont even know. (on the sticker it says the following: Compac-C.G.Emery International Limited. Markham Ont. L3H 1A9) these 2 red rods have old steel or aluminum guides, those red rods are 2 piece and look to be 5' 10"" in lenghy + i found two South Bend Icefishing rods...probably not going to use the rods or that lure i found but it's neat to own some older tackle. Great reel again tho, hopefully we can see some other old items in this thread."
331961,misfish,2009-04-19 18:30:00,29133,I have this reel.     You need to reverse it to open the bail.  
332157,shane,2009-04-20 00:31:00,652,I've got a dozen or so old rods and reels that I've picked up over the years.   This is the only one that has a box.    One of my favorites. The only ID is on the bottom. Just says LAWRENCE and Made in USA.

332507,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-20 15:01:00,0,that's very friggin' cool!
332524,bigugli,2009-04-20 15:27:00,6138,"I guess I took care of some of my stuff better than i thought, or, they were built a lot better then. I still have my very first glass rod and it is still in use.   In the display box I have my first reel, a 300A, a heddon spincast, and an old level wind     Behind the level wind is an old ""Red Eye""  (they still make em). There is also an old wooden plug or 2   My grandfather and uncle had matching Luxor reels from the 50's. My son now has one of them and both are still working"
332528,misfish,2009-04-20 15:34:00,29133,  I have that one aswell.Wish I had the box.
332556,GBW,2009-04-20 16:27:00,8460,I have this reel from my father.   
332564,Governator,2009-04-20 16:55:00,879,"I know nothing about antiques... but father in law picked up this at a yard sale and now it's in my garage (Sorry for crappy quality, used phone).  I couldn't tell ya anything about it, you guys would probably know more.      "
332574,Blake,2009-04-20 17:39:00,418,Great to see some old gear.
