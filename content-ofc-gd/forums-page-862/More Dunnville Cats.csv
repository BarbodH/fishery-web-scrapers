Managed 3 27 inchers a couple 24's and Jonny managed a nice 31 incher that registered right around 15 pounds.  Fishing cut bait in a deep hole halfway down to the lake. Circle hooks sure made me a beleiver, if you havnt tried them for baitfishing then get out and buy some. Only missed a couple fish because we were too anxious, everything else was in the corner of the mouth like advertised.             Unfortuntaly it seems I have to give my friends a lesson in my camera again as the pictures of me are blurrier then my right eye!"
331997,PERCHER,2009-04-19 20:23:00,787,Well you braved the wind and cooler temps and it paid off for you way to go.Next Saturday looks like it's going to be a good day to be on the Grand.Going to take the wife out  maybe we will see you out on the water . And Darren take good care of that eye.If you want that number send me a p.m.
332000,smokin joe,2009-04-19 20:26:00,226,Those are some pretty cats for sure Bucktail.  Never set the hook unless it's a sweepset otherwise you're in deep and fighting to get the hook out (if you're lucky) or miss it entirely   Still a nice job man
332003,Joeytier,2009-04-19 20:31:00,3990,way to go on the cats.  How long does the catfishing stay good in there?  I'd like to make it out there once more.
332010,smokin joe,2009-04-19 20:38:00,226,"Joeytier the Cats will be in there for a long time, but as the water warms the big ones tend to move deep till the cooler temps in the evening (hence the catfishing at night)  hope this helps"
332013,Joeytier,2009-04-19 20:43:00,3990,Thanks for the info.
