I will personally come up there and bash their nads in with a Wiffle Ball Bat, whilst they roll around in unmitigated agony on the permafrost type tundra!!!"
332324,Cudz,2009-04-20 03:09:00,2652,hmm that offer of a nad-bash is tempting.  If it is still available in the morning I might take you up on that.  I haven't been hit with a wiffle ball bat in that location for years.
