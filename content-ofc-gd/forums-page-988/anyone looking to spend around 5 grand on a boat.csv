233740,bow slayer,2008-07-28 18:50:00,1074,"There is a boat package for 8 grand on the classified board. 17ft Lowe with a 75 E-Tech.  I would really like to put that motor on my boat. Here is the deal If someone is willing to spend 5 grand I will put up the 3 grand . I then will swap you motors, you keep the boat and a 2001 40hp Evinrude 4-stroke. I get the 75 e-tech.  Or if someone wants to buy that boat for the price asked I will swap you motors plus 3000."
233781,fishinggeek,2008-07-28 20:31:00,325,"Interesting proposal, and I'm looking for a boat myself.  The Lowe Stinger, according to my Lowe catalogue, is 17.5 feet long, 85 inches wide, hull weight of 1110 pounds, with a max hp rating of 75.  Do you think the 40HP 4-stroke has enough power to make it plane with 2-4 adults in it?"
233804,Rizzo,2008-07-28 21:13:00,4754,"my guess would be 2 adults yes, 4 adults no...but that's just a guess"
233806,misfish,2008-07-28 21:16:00,29133," NO That boat is set just perfect, the way it is set up."
233815,canadianboy,2008-07-28 21:30:00,83,bowslayer you are a smart man you end up only really paying like say the 40hp is worth 2000 then 5000 for a 8000 dollar motor i think that the lowe stinger would plane with 4 light weight adults
234046,fishinggeek,2008-07-29 15:04:00,325, Thanks for the guess.  Sounds right to me.   Thanks.  I would've guessed the same thing.  I'm out for this deal.  Nothing more annoying than an under-powered boat with several adults and rough waters.
234057,mikeh,2008-07-29 15:54:00,824,"If you're interested in this boat I think it is a OFC member CRANKS BAIT that is trying to sell it, or he has a similar one for sale in the classifieds."
