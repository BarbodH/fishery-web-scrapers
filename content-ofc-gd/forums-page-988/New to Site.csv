233770,Almontefisher,2008-07-28 20:13:00,18,Just wanted to say hello and introduce myself...I am obviously new to the site but was told by a buddy that it is well done.  I will browse around a while before posting too much.  I am an avid fisherman who loves trout fishing but hates eating fish...I have a cottage up in the Ompah area and fish mainly around there.  I live in Carleton Place and fish the Mississippi Lkae and Miss river alot.  Have been fishing since I was 3 with a little stop during highschool cause my friends did not think fishing was the cool thing to do.  Anyway look forward to meeting some of you and sharing some reports if I catch any fish worth reporting.
