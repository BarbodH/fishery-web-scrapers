233315,keram,2008-07-27 14:55:00,585,I'm after walleye with this one  
233318,Greencoachdog,2008-07-27 15:01:00,8163, Have you informed the Walleye of this? Sometimes the targeted species don' know they're supposed to bite a certain lure and other species think it's perfectly ok to bite it... you ned to sit these fish down and have a talk with them!  That is a beautiful lure Keram!!!
