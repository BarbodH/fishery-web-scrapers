233348,aplumma,2008-07-27 17:45:00,6896, The main reason that you see allot of the big 3's as work trucks is they give big buy discounts for repeat/fleet vehicle purchases. It's also easier for the big companies that have in house repair service to stock the parts for the same brand of vehicles.  While I am sure that some of their commercials were trying to show their trucks with  commercial possibilities the market for work trucks was never the aim of Nissan or Toyota both of them are set up for aggressive driving and towing. If you look around you will also find some of the Datsun pickup trucks which is what they were badged as before they became Nissans almost 30 years ago.  I have no problems with buying products from the country you live in it makes sense when it is possible. I don't feel that buying from over seas is a bad thing either. If you had to chose from a bad local serviceman or a good one that was outside of your township which would you call? Do you only buy from the small shops even if the price or quality is less than the big store? I feel that weighing all of the factors is very important in making a decision when it is YOUR money you are spending when you want the most for your money. If I had a fleet of trucks it most likely would be Fords but since it is just my vehicle that I have to maintain I drive a Sprinter Van which is made by Mercedes while more expensive than the fords outright it has had a much lower cost per mile than any of the Big three I have owned in the past. Yes the sprinter is now a GM product but it has non of the technology associated with GM company.  Art

The reliability, was the problem.  A lot of different suspension stuff including the half-shafts were replaced twice during it's 320,000 reign.  It was like every month a 2-300 dollar bill was needed to keep the car repaired.  By the time, everything was fixed, the brakes were up for replacement, and so it would go, if you missed a month or two, you knew the next repair would be a doosy.  Another one required a new/re-built tranny after reaching the 18,000 kilometre mark. Luckily that was covered by the warrantee,.... but ya gotta ask yerself, .....""how can a car with less than 19k need a new transmission?"" Something wrong with that picture."

The wheel by my hands steer it.  I've been anal about  preventative maintenance with all my vehicles.  What this means to me is....regular oil changes, brake pads, muffler/pipes, spark plugs, wires, air filter, timing belt etc...  Here's my vehicle history.  1983 Mercury Lynx - Blown head gasket after 70,000 kms.  1985 Cavalier - rack and pinion steering replaced after 70,000 kms.  Transmission replaced at 110,000 kms.  Got rid of the thing when at 120,000 km the head gasket blew.  1990 Toyota Corolla - Just got rid of it last year.  It had almost 400,000 kms on it.  The only major things that I ever had done was a few starters, a water pump and a radiator.  Air conditioning failed after 12 years.  1998 Honda CRV - Water pump failed at 99,000kms.  Fixed under warranty no questions asked.  New Rad.  One Ball joint.  Oh yeah....air conditioning needed recharging after 7 years.  Still have the vehicle....it now has 280,000 kms on it and it still runs like new.  Before I started buying my own vehicles, my dad bought a second hand mid 70's Corolla for my mom to drive.  The thing had around 500,000 kms on it and the body rusted out....the engine was fine.  I know all makes/models will have lemons....including the imports.  Our Corolla was made in Ontario....no idea where my CRV was made.  I've always had luck with Toyota and Honda, so next vehicle will likely be the same."

233858,oncogene,2008-07-28 23:26:00,154,"My colleague in lab wanted to buy a used car few years ago and asked me to help test-drive one he interested in. I already advised him not to get a domestic USED car (i wont' even trust a domestic new, let alone used). The one I test-drove for him, the brake was so bad I had to floor it EVERYTIME in even normal braking situation. I told that to the dealer and what did he say? ""It's a used Ford (or Dodge), what do you expect""... and he sounded very serious.  Anyway my colleague ended up buying a different used domestic later. I think it was $8-9000. That junk died all the time, esp once winter came. He said he brought the car to shop for numerous times, spent a good $2-3000 and still couldnt' even figure out what's wrong. When winter came, during 1 snowstorm, his car died on highway in between towns. Luckily a lady pulled over and took him and his wife back to town. Few weeks later we got another snowstorm. He asked me if I could drive to the other town to pick up his wife with him. I was like ""your car still not working?"". His car was actually ""fixed"" and running (sorta). But he's AFRAID to drive that junk in a snowstorm. I OKed to drive him to get his wife in Gananoque back to Kingston, in my car obviously.  Soon later he traded in that junk for a previous-year model brand new Corolla. He was so happy, and most importantly he was RELIEVED!    My first car was a Toyota Rav4. At the time, Ford Escape was the competing vehicle in the same ""class"". I did quite abit of research be4 deciding on the Rav4. The differences in quality and ppl's expectation were definitely huge.  From the Rav4 forum, 1 major ""flaw"" of Rav4 was a NOISE from the dash area, in some of the Rav4.... which turned out to be the plastic battery cover rubbing on the windshield and could be easily fixed by a few inches of sticky foam tap. But some ppl were getting so angry about how the Toyota quality was bad (becoz of that 1 fixable NOISE problem) etc etc.  Then in the Ford Escape forum.... well, 1 guy (or lady) test-drove a Escape and the steering wheel broke (LOL). Then some guy posted about his brand new Escape engine DIED for no reason and asked if other ppl had similar problem. Sure enough a few ppl replied having the same issue (Ford, engines, dies? what a surprised!). But what's really funny? all those few ppl, despite having the dead engine on a brand new Escape, would go on and comment how they LOVED their Escape, etc, etc. They just talked about the mysterious engine dying problem as if it's nothing! like It's just part of  the fun and joy of buying a Ford?!?  Didn't take me long to exclude the Ford Escape from my list at the time thats' for sure."

233306,Canuck2fan,2008-07-27 14:05:00,1444," Well my old boss had a dodge caravan and he put 380K on it. In that time he begrudgingly replaced the ball joints once, the oil about 4 times. His major repair was the ecm when he decided to be chivalrous and jump start a very good looking woman's car that wouldn't start in our parking lot. Whether he didn't know or was busy looking at the eye candy he cross connected the cables and shorted out most of his electrics.... Other than that, the van just went and went. I must say all of the trim pieces in the interior fell off or broke but the van did delivery in town and out for about 11 years without ever letting him down.  One of my customers has two caravans. He said the one is getting ready to be put out to pasture since he has about 325K on it now. His wife demanded that the second last vehicle she got be something different than a Caravan. So he let her pick out a Montana. They had it for 4 months after they went to Florida in it she demanded they get rid of it. Too noisy, too uncomfortable it literally crippled her to sit in it or drive it for more than an hour at a time. (I found the same thing when I drove a friends home from lake Simcoe, worse seats I have ever sat in, in any vehicle.) Trading in that 4 month old Montana cost him about 7 grand but after a week in the new Caravan he wasn't even mad at his wife anymore over the money because it just fit them better. His son's wife has a caravan and she has about 280K on it and no major problems with that one either.  One thing with Caravan's is to religiously follow the maintainence reccommendations and use Chrysler fluid when you do, if you have a ""good"" one you should reasonably expect pretty much the same except for items that wear out after high mileage on any vehicle."

I have been buying Honda's since 1988 and have NEVER had a single major component go on one of them.

Well let me be the first to say... build a car/van/pickup that can stands up to the demands of 30-60 k a year and not need major ""warranty"" work within three years and i will give another new one a try again.  As for now,, i hedge my bets for my business needs and bought another USED Caravan from my mechanic that already has the tranny rebuilt and motor done.( it was his wifes vehicle since new amd they are friends of mine) I bought it used since the North American auto manufacturers are building throw away b\vehicles and expecting ""keeper"" clients.

232651,doubleheader,2008-07-25 12:22:00,497,"Okay, above, in the first reply to this post I said I'd never buy another Ford. I won't, but not because of quality, because of the way Ford tries to rip people off. Here's how I became a Honda owner.  Started off with an outboard I bought in 1997. Around 2001 the flywheel came apart, a couple years out of warranty. Honda covered the parts and labor 100%.  Around a year later the paint on the cowling started to peel. Honda covered it 100%.  My wife bought an Accord in 1998, put 100K miles on it and never bought anything but tires and brakes, not rotors, just brakes. I bought a Pilot in 2004, after 3 years with zero problems I decided I wanted to trade it for a Ridgeline. After Dealer incentives and rebates, Honda gave me $26,000 trade-in (paid 31K new) on the Pilot that had 47K miles. My wife now drives a Civic around 70 miles round- trip to work each day. She has 60K on the Civic, no issues, gets 38 mpg except in the winter.  Although current outboard is a Mercury Verado I even own a Honda mower.   Honda makes great products and stands behind them. They understand that it's far more easy to retain customers than find new ones. As a result they establish business policies that align with that objective."

232656,Billy Bob,2008-07-25 12:31:00,5865," WOW, for supposedly knowing so much about the Tundra you don't even have the engine correct. Toyota doesn't make a 5.9 L engine  Park your truck and let me back into the front fender with my rear bumper and lets see the same damage occur. ALL vehicles are made with thin sheet metal to hold down cost and weight.  I have a friend that will ONLY purchase American made articles if possible. He found in his trade magazine (he's a calibration technician) a article about the Toyota Tundra's commercials. The bottom line of the article was they checked up on the Tundra's commercials and they were indeed all true, no smoke and mirrors. I moved 4 cords of wood for him in the Tundra and after that he recommended the truck to his brother. However, his brother did not purchase one because as Pete says he is cheap and is still driving his clunker around with the fenders and bumpers just about dragging down the street.  (I will try to find the magazine in the future to post)  Bottom line for me is, I will NEVER purchase another Ford or GM truck. I can't give my opinion on Dodge trucks since I have never owned one. I did have several of their cars in the 70's and nothing but bad luck with them. Purchase whatever you like but I will no longer support Bankrupt Motors or the Ford Motor Co.  Bob"

Never said I was an expert just telling you our experiences with the two we had. I do believe I said I am glad you are having better luck with yours. The damage was from the Toyota's bumper because it folded too easy in my opinion and looking at it compared to other bumpers it looks pretty thin. Just an observation not cold hard facts. I will stand behind the towing comments I made earlier, I've towed with all four makes and out of the four I did not like the Toyota at all, just a seat of the pants thing, again no hard facts just a feeling. My 05 Chevy is a crappy tow vehicle compared to my 95 GMC but there is no comparison in the gas mileage. So I tow with the 05.

One repair guy and no worries.   I have been looking at the new fat body style,which looks so PHAT,but I got my sights on a boat."
232415,Rich,2008-07-24 22:04:00,3927,"My brother is a mechanic, and says the trucks coming in for the most major repairs last year were Chev Silverados, and anything Dodge. Dodge mostly transmission problems, GM.. just about everything. He said Ford's are actually pretty good trucks, for American made."
232438,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-24 22:35:00,0," Bet on what? Japanese customer service against Ford???  You have any problem a Japanese dealer will resolve it no questions asked. Not the case with American made. I know of so many people that got BRAND NEW lemons, and what did they do? Nothing. Either that or they charge you an arm and a leg to rectify it. And sometimes even then it doesn't solve the problem. And they will tell you, oh well that part was broken also."
232442,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-24 22:37:00,0,OOPs. Double post!
232450,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-24 22:45:00,0,I apologize to all the people that work at Ford and such! But they have to start getting their act together. They are falling behind in every way.....  The auto industry in North America was already headed downhill and the minivan saved them(at least for a little while). I think the F150's and the Mustangs saved Ford. But what now? Maybe the hydrogen car GM is working on will put them back on top.
232458,misfish,2008-07-24 22:50:00,29133,"NO, That  they do also rip you off. My sis outlaw had here Honda towed to a Honda delearship and they cut all her break lines do to ""THEY FELT""the car was not road worthy. Just so you know,she had everything replaced for FREE and a 1000 dollar gas card given to her,after a letter from her lawyer. What a dumb   move,wouldnt you say?"
232460,Rich,2008-07-24 22:53:00,3927,Yeah I'd say it all depends on the dealership. Doesn't matter what they deal they could be great or shady on their policies.
232461,Moosebunk,2008-07-24 22:54:00,3970,"I'll be looking to buy next spring and I've spent the morning today viewing both the Tundra and Tacoma.  We have a 99 Silverado Ext.Cab. that's been a fair truck for us.  When my wife bought it in 2000 it had 45,000km's on it and over the 8 years we've only put 50,0000kms on it.  Still under 100,000.  Major problems we've had were... the power windows.  There was a design flaw that year for the tracking of the trucks power windows.  A dealer pointed this out to us as he was gouging our wallets of about $900 to fix one window and semi-fix the other.  Of course, the semi-fix was a full fix a year later and we got dinged another $800.  Chev couldn't afford to recall all Silverado's even though one of their dealers was admitting they screwed up.  Many people likely didn't notice the problem as much as us, for again, the driver's side of our truck is in need of repair.  Reason being, it seems to be the rough roads; and one time definitely after the truck got off the train chain car, which worsen the problem.  Otherwise, our Silverado pretty much bi-annually needed ball joints replaced, I have done brakes once, shocks once, and all tires once.  There has been an ongoing tailgate problem as well but it's been MacGyver'd.  I like the looks of the new Silverado's but am not sure if they're the right choice, I understand they get pretty poor gas mileage comparitively......... (would like to know differences between them all)  Motor Trend 2008 truck of the year was the Tundra.  Any Tundra or Tacoma owners have any opinions on their trucks?"
232491,silvio,2008-07-24 23:39:00,433,What FORD stands for in Italian  -Fatto Oggi Rotto Domani  in English that means made today broken tomorrow
232499,FUSION,2008-07-24 23:47:00,81," Youtube is not my bible but I know the facts are hard to swallow. Just wondering if you did any real research about your Tundra before you bought it besides driveing it around the block? Were you aware of the documented camshaft problems, electircal failures, bed bounce problems, tailgate problems, exhaust rattle problems, seatbelt warning chim problems when you researched your truck? I know, I know... I know nothing about the tundra. Its only a year old, I should hope it hasen't been in the shop! I have driven the new Tundra about half a dozen times as I know people who own them. It rides like a suv because thats what it is. Ladered frame, not stamped ""only full size truck that uses it"" suv coiled suspension. The only difference between your truck and the Sequoia suv is the box on the back whick is going to end up cracking your back window under load because its ankered so well to your laddered minivan style frame. A truck that big and heavy sitting on a weak unboxed laddered frame with too soft suspension and weak leaf springs towing a heavy load on the hiway scares the hell out of me. Also wondering how you use your front tow hooks without ripping your bumper off??? As there mounted up and under the bumper of your truck. Yet another ""inclass first"" for toyota  . Hey, I will be the first to say the tundra has power under the hood which makes up alittle bit for its look and overpriced price tag but real truck buyers know its not put together solidly thats why its dead last in sales in the 1500 segment in north america. And as far as north american trucks not haveing it right... If we don't have it right were the hell does that leave you??? Maybe the next redesign Toyota will let the engineer stay for a few more weeks over here and  rent  him a real truck to drive so he can see what its all about. Again enjoy your truck just please becarefull if you try to sit or stand on your tailgate as I wouldn't want to see you hit the ground and hurt yourself when it gives way. Tailgate problems... More tundra problems"

I loved that Van till i was in a car accident a little over a month ago and the van was written off. It had 268,000 KM on her and still ran like a little beauty...I was gutted she was wrote off.  ...Done alot of travleing and towing with her and you would not beleive the crap i have moved with that van and she was allways good to me."
232237,lookinforwalleye,2008-07-24 16:26:00,4399,"Yes we all now the story domestics stink and Japanesse products are perfect, ask all the Toyota Yaris owners how they like their trannies or a buddy of mine who`s Honda Civic with less than 30k Km`s threw a piston through the block.  In my driveway you will see a Buick, a GMC, a Ford and a Dodge! Don`t get me wrong I love Toyota and Honda as they are VERY good customers of mine I just hate the constant bashing of the domestics."
232240,BillM,2008-07-24 16:32:00,17367,"Only trucks that have ever seen our driveway are GMC and Toyota.  No complaints on either of them (Except the mileage on the V6 Tacoma was horrible for the size of the truck.)  Currently the oldman has a '07 GMC 2500HD Duramax, absolutely loves it.  A '06 Jetta TDI also is stashed inside his garage..  Personally, I don't buy cars that aren't diesel   My '00 Jetta TDI has 475,000km's on it and there is no sign of it giving up anytime soon.  Only thing that isn't original engine wise is the starter.  Besides a few sets of brakes, some e-brake cables its all original.  Maintenance is the key to having your car/truck last a long time."
232243,Wild,2008-07-24 16:42:00,704,"Yes a reputable shop like MrT will do a fine job just make sure they give you the warranty you need. Just one thing, put a cooler on the trany and if you do tow with it get them to tighten up the shifts some to reduce heat and clutch wear, change the fluid on a regular basis because that's where every auto transmission will die from abuse. And use Royal Purple transmission oil if you can. Some Ford automatics do suck but it's also how you maintain them.  Oh FYI, I run a few Rangers mine is a old faithful 86;) not going to sell her anytime soon."
232246,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-24 16:51:00,0," I also cant understand why my Nissan Pathfider which is fairly small and has Japanese technology, burn so much gas!!! And I always keep it in overdrive. Out of overdrive it is worse! city or hiway!  I have no doubt, if they wanted to, the truck can be modified to burn way less gas. Probably take away from the power, (like the Toyota 4 runner) but it would be an all around better towing vehicle, unless you are pulling heavy loads."
