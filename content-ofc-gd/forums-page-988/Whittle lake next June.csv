I'll fill you in as much as I can about the lake when I return from holidays, if I forget pm me and i'll do so then. I have lots of pics and maps I can pass along to you as well. If you search Whittle Lake on the forum you'll find my latest report. You will have a great time up there and won't find a nicer camp anywhere for a fly-in.  Mike"
