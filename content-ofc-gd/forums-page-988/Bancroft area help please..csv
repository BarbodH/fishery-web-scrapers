I was wondering if anyone could PM me any possible shore spots that would be suitable for fishing with kids 4-9 yrs. We'll be looking for picnic spots as well. Don't need to know any honey holes just spots where there might be ample panfish to keep the kids occupied for a short time.  BTW if anyone is going and sees my van, can't really miss it as it's plastered with work logo and stuff, please say hi.  Thanks,  Stan"

I'm at the cottage about 1/2 hour away and hope I don't go to town.  The Gemboree is a great experience.  Did it when I was a kid.  The Dairy Queen there is a great spot.  Make sure you order a small, cause their servings are HUGE, or at least they used to be.  Are you taking a boat or just shore fishing?  If shore and might only be an hour or so, before the kids give up, I know there is a river that runs through town.  The north end has some parks with table and right next to the river if I recall properly.  Have a great weekend."

I'll be sure to give DQ a go so long as the lines aren't too nuts. We'll be packing some food to picnic on anyways.  Can I expect the usual sunfish and perch or rockbass there? (I'll be using artificial plastics, e.g. power maggots etc.)  Stan"

I've only ever driven past it.  There is a tackle shop on the right hand side as you head north out of town towards the park,  they would have some info as well.  As for line ups, they are going to be everywhere.  Wise idea on packing food, and drinks."
