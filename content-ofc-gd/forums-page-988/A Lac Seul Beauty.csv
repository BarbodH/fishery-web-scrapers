I've been fortunate to have fished Lac Seul before and it is a little piece of heaven. What lodge were you staying with? Look forward to your full report when you get the chance.  Cheers, 1leg"

233680,Headhunter,2008-07-28 15:01:00,5703,WTG Jim... very impressive! HH
233722,ehg,2008-07-28 17:49:00,2666,"Great fish! Read once that Lac Seul muskies have the highest rate of growth of anywhere due to shorter feeding seasons, and abundance of forage. What a great trip that must be. Thanks for post, ehg"
233759,splashhopper,2008-07-28 19:34:00,2931,HOLY CRAP! THat fish is almost as long as I am tall !  WTG
232990,mistyriver1,2008-07-26 04:47:00,600,"I'm on my way back from Sioux lookout but was dying to put at least this report up.  I've got some other pics to load and I'll do that when I get home.  This past Monday, I had the pleasure of accompanying the owner of the lodge I stayed at and one of the guides for some musky fishing on Lac Seul.  We headed out around 2:30.  We tried a few spots and then came to another.  I was throwing a topwater and saw this giant following it in.  I said ""I've got a follow"" and the guide said ""speed it up"".  I did and she followed it right to the boat.  As soon as I started my figure 8 ......BANG ...SHE NAILED IT.  My rod bent in half almost instantly and Greg (our guide) had the fish in the net.  I let out a huge YAAAAAA and I had my biggest fish of my life.  Here she is....52 inches and a 24 inch girth !!!!!!      Back you go Big Girl...thanks for one of the greatest moments of my fishing life.    We fished for a while after that and saw a total of 6 muskies that day.  I lost another one but I did take some comfort in that she wasn't as big as the girl I landed.  I went out with another guy from the lodge last night and we saw another 7 fish.  I can't describe how good the fishing is here.  I've certainly enjoyed my time here.  Jim"
232991,yo_guy,2008-07-26 04:51:00,111,WOW!!! that fish is a tank.... I've been wanting to go that lake for the muskies just haven't had the opportunity. So many places to fish and not enough time.
