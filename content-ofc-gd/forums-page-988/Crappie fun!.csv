Oh, the stringer was simply for the photo as he couldn't hang on to the ""big and wiggly fish"" by the lip. The fish was set free to live another day. Thought you guys would enjoy.    "
233321,jediangler,2008-07-27 15:04:00,1923,Nice fish and great pic. He certainly is the crappie hunter.
233327,Garry2Rs,2008-07-27 15:54:00,1425,"How deep were these Crappie? If they were suspended, over how much water, if not what cover were they around? I've never target them after the Spring, but wouldn't mind giving it a try with the neighbour's little girl... Thanks Garry2rs"
233331,Landlocked,2008-07-27 16:12:00,171,"Garry, These fish were around a ""beaver building"" as he calls it in about 6 ft of water.  We had the bait suspended about half way down and simply drifted along the shoreline.  The weather was pretty cool with showers on and off so it may have just been good timing for us.  I highly recommend the slip floats for young and old..they are a lot easier to cast and use than the traditional bobber."
