233555,bpsbassman,2008-07-28 02:52:00,941,Beautiful looking bass Evster.  What a great day!!
233563,urbanangler1990,2008-07-28 03:24:00,933," you guys were totally accurate about how windy it can get there, we inflated our boat, slowly rolled it down OTHER launch and hopped in. All was looking great, i start paddling from the back and im getting twisted and turned right around, i managed to rid myself of the shore by ten feet,"
233569,RobHall,2008-07-28 03:43:00,261," Nice buckets Evan...thanks for sharing.  One quick question....is this you in the following video?  http://www.wfn.tv/adopt/x6p2269g-1  It sure looks like you and your boat and your wife.  The above entry is the one i picked to win the boat this year in the WFN Adopt an Angler contest.  I've watched all the video entries and yours was the best so far.  Good Luck Evan!  Cheers,  FOTB "
233597,evster,2008-07-28 10:45:00,367," Haha!  Ya, thats me!  I was going to post a link but I wanted to wait until after the voting because I know lots of people here are voting for Joey, so keep voting for her guys!  That video was sure fun to make.  For the record, this aluminum is not technically my boat, it's my brother-in-laws and I borrow it (won't be able to borrow it forever).  Would love to have my own!  Thanks for the encouragement! Evan"

233089,evster,2008-07-26 15:40:00,367,"Yesterday afternoon my wife and I took the short drive up to Island Lake Conservation Area to give it a try.  I had fished there before and got a couple nice bass so I was looking forward to it.  Well we did WAY better.  They were biting on everything as well.  Spinnerbaits, jigs, soft plastics.  They were everywhere.  Overall we got 27 fish, 16 of which were decent bass.  We started the day off with a double header!  Our first time getting a double header so it was pretty exciting.    We caught lots of fish around this size:      At some point in the day we were talking about how it was cool we were able to get a double header when wham, fish on.  I yell for net and my wife yells, ""oh crap!  I got one on too!!!"".  So I had to scramble back to the back of the boat without falling in, net my fish, then net her fish.  Somehow I managed to do this without flipping the boat or falling in myself, and neither fish were lost.  But I noticed after the fact that somehow amongst the chaos I blew the button off my shorts...maybe I need to consider loosing a bit off the waste line.    My wife's fish was a really nice one.  I don't know what it is but she always gets bigger fish than me.  No matter where we go she does it.  Anyway, it was a great time, I love getting out fishing with her.  Even though she tends to show me up!"
233091,salmon,2008-07-26 15:52:00,334,"Wow, nice buckets Jose"
233100,bbog,2008-07-26 16:52:00,665,Nice looking fish - well done!  Oh and the best way to keep the wife interested is to continue to let her outfish you
233102,woodro,2008-07-26 17:01:00,168,nice job those fish are beauties. How'd they fight?
233106,salmon,2008-07-26 17:11:00,334,Figures the best day of the week (weather wise) and I end up at Canada's Wonderland. LOL Were they caught in certain areas? Looks like the western side of the lake?  Jose
233116,spinnerdoc,2008-07-26 17:54:00,556,"i was there last week and i did alright will post pics here when i het it developed.i got a disposable waterproof camera which was a great idea at the time.i was fishing in the rain,it was on and off but i was prepared with the raincoat and stuff.i caught about 1bucket and 7 pikes. not as well as you did but it was fun. and oh during those 6 hours i was scooping water of the boat, which i thought was hilarious. those are pretty nice fish you and your wife caught.congrats"
233120,JoshS,2008-07-26 17:59:00,729,nice fish!
233126,4thgen,2008-07-26 18:04:00,157,Nice fish! I noticed that their tails are all split pretty badly though -- maybe time to invest in one of those rubber nets or just lip them at the side of the boat.?
233131,nancur373,2008-07-26 18:15:00,1211,Did you take your own boat or rent one?
233136,Greencoachdog,2008-07-26 18:43:00,8163,"Great report and pics!!!  I notice your wife outfished you from the back of the boat, she'd really put a Whoopin' you if she ever fished from the front eh!!!"
233137,MrMike,2008-07-26 18:51:00,153,great report neat pics
233140,urbanangler1990,2008-07-26 18:54:00,933,"wow sweet bass, do u know if there is a boat rental there? or would it be okay if i used my little inflatable boat?"
233144,jediangler,2008-07-26 19:09:00,1923,"Well done. Lots of good bass in Orangeville, and no gas burners to stink the place up. Lots of rental options Urban, including kayaks, canoes, and tin boats with electric trolling motors. Your inflatable would be fine as long as it is not a really windy day."
233146,urbanangler1990,2008-07-26 19:17:00,933,"hey thanks jedi, may try it out tommorow"
233148,salmon,2008-07-26 19:25:00,334, Bring your own inflatable. But if you want to rent call ahead and reserve a boat for yourself. Weekends are pretty busy. Jose
233156,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-26 19:54:00,2585,great report!  cheers
233158,evster,2008-07-26 20:15:00,367,"Thanks guys!  It was a blast.  I'll try to answer some questions that haven't been answered yet.   Some of them fought like crazy and kept wanting to bury themselves in weeds or stumps.  Some not so good, they just sort of let me pull them to the boat.  The best fighter ended up having about 6 pounds of weeds on his snout...kind of disapointed when I got him in.   Yep, pretty much all on the western side.  Didn't have a need to go try out the other arm of the lake.   Looking forward to those pics!   I didn't notice that until you mentioned it.  And yes almost every fish we caught had then now when I look back at the pics.  I do have a rubber net, so I doubt I caused that.  It is a catch and release lake for bass, so maybe it is due to the fact each of these fish has probably been caught a bunch of times.  Or maybe its something else in their environment.   Took my own.  14 foot tinny with a bowmount  , its perfect for these conservation areas.   I don't even what to know what that would be like!!!  I love seeing her catching nice fish...just I want a big one every once in a while!"
233161,Leecher,2008-07-26 20:55:00,7832,Great job evster   those a some really nice lookin buckets  Thanks for sharing Leechman
233162,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-07-26 21:03:00,1362,Awesome report and pics....you're a lucky man to have a wife that likes to fish (and out fishes ya  ) ...
233169,yo_guy,2008-07-26 21:31:00,111,If anyone plans on going on an inflatable on that lake it can get very nasty with whitecaps so it's best to check the weatherman a head of time. It's beens years since I have went back great place for a family outting none the less.  As mentioned in the above weekends are really busy and crowded.
233224,Cudz,2008-07-27 01:23:00,2652,"Woe, nice fish.  It is great to see you don't have to spend $$$$ to catch big bass. Great report"
233303,Rich,2008-07-27 13:58:00,3927,"Nice largies, kudos to you and your wife..  But dude - where do I know you from?"
233307,spinnerdoc,2008-07-27 14:07:00,556,i have a rubber boat and i don't taky it there bec one the weather can be windy at times and it a hard paddle back to shore. kayak would be a better bet.
233309,mistyriver1,2008-07-27 14:22:00,600,"Great report, looks like a fun day.  Good to see the Bass coming back there."
233313,TJQ,2008-07-27 14:46:00,7806,"Nice fish, great report!"
