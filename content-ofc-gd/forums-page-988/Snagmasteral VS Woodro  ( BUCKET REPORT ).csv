232974,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-26 03:23:00,0," You know I always stock up!!  Sounds good. Try to call me a day before though. Because more than likely, if I have no one to fish with, I will head out by myself early morning, and chances are I wont be on Simcoe. Unless I know someone is coming up."
