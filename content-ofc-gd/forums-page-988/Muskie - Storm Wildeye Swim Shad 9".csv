Only problem is due to the hook positioning, its hard to hook. I've been meaning to add a treble hook to the bottom of the lure like some of the smaller swim baits they have. Does anyone have any good ways of rigging this up?"
233883,GbayGiant,2008-07-29 00:45:00,1780,"I assume this is a one top hook only bait, just use floro or wire and tie a stinger off the top hook and insert one treble into the bottom to hold it wherever you want."
233901,Sebastian,2008-07-29 01:43:00,208,Its a 2 top hook bait and Ya i ended up doing that. That was my most logical thinking but wanted to see if someone did anything creative. I tried cutting the lure open and running one from the wire inside but that didnt work out too well. Thanks for the help GbayGiant. Appreciate it.
