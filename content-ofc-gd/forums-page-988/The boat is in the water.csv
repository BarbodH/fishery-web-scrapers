I traded days off with a co-worker so having a rare Sunday off I was able to get back out to Big Cliffs early this morning (they were just getting up ) .  Got the boat hooked up and off to Beans I went.  Thanks to Degs great tutalage I was able to back the trailer in with no problems and  Beans and I took her for a short run, she runs great  Now since I won't be able to get out there for at least two weeks it's up to Beans to take her out   and get some good Kawartha slime into her  I'll be looking for those reports Beans  Maureen"

233686,Big Cliff,2008-07-28 16:00:00,6899,"Moe, as always it was a pleasure and I was glad that I could help out. BTW, thank you so very much for the box of doughnuts they were sure a big hit with everyone. Sorry I couldn't spend more time with you but with 35 people to feed brunch to I kind of had my day booked for me LOL.  Those darn kids made me drink about 4 or 5 beers (I lost track after about two) and kept me up until almost midnight, I must have looked a sorry sight (I know I felt kind of rough LOL). Anway, if it does give you any more trouble, let me know and just remember ""If you can't fix it with a hammer, you've got an electrical problem""!"

No carp at Buckhorn this morning...Back to the point tomorrow..."
