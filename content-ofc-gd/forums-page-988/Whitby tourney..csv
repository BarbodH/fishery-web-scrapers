Was a bit of tough decision whether to weigh it in the tourney as we both held derby tickets and can't be weighed for both but thought better about maybe watching it slip down the board. If it was 1 pound bigger it would of been even tougher decision.It was caught with a rac spoon 70ft over 140 ft in front of the Pickering nuke station. Fun day in the waves and the sun. Was nice to see the proceeds from his tourney benefiting the ringwood hatchery.
