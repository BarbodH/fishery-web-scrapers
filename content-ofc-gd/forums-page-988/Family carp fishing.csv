With not a lot of time, we decided to head over to Frenchman's bay for a couple of hours to wet a line.  I set up the kids with a float and worm.  One of them just got a Rocket Fishing Rod which is junk.  The line kept tangling inside the barrel and the float does not go much further than 15 feet.  So for anyone that is thinking of purchasing it, I would suggest going with a normal rod and reel push button combo.  We weren't having much luck with the worm so I decided to throw mine in with a few pieces of corn.  I just casted it and forgot about it.  Within 20 minutes, my reel is bouncing and screaming.  Good think I hooked the reel on the fence otherwise it was have been in the lake.  After a 5 minute battle this guy comes in.  We ended up going 2 for 3.  One was lost right at shore.  Nephew got too excited.  Thanks Bly for the help. "
