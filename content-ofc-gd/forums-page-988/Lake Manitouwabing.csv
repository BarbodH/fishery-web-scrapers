Has anyone fished it before?  Any comments / suggestions for the lake...anything, i mean anything will help.  Lures, good species to target, of course hot spots...yeah yeah...I know...  Any help would be appreciated.  I am only up for a couple days, if I can minimize the surveying time it would help."

I remember nights as a (younger) kid, landing 20 walleye and 50 bullhead.  A floating jighead and worm with splitshots about a foot from the bait. let it sit on bottom and wait with a tight line.  I remember it not taking long."

234042,BillM,2008-07-29 14:51:00,17367,There is a rock shoal in the main lake basin directly across from the private kids camp.  Should be the only white bleach bottle you see out there  Excellent place for pickerel.
