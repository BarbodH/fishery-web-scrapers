233543,Leecher,2008-07-28 02:33:00,7832,"Guys,  Got out late afternoon today for a few hours on the river to try our luck at the Rideau Falls.  Left home at around 5:00pm, got to the launch ramp ho maybe 20 minutes later and arrived at the Falls 5:45pm.  Took a pic of the Falls as the water from it was rushing out to the max    Didn't take long, Paul caught an SMB but did not have the chance to take a pic because he lost it right at the boat even before I could grab the net to help.  In the mean time we notice big dark clouds over on the other side and didn't look good    Then Paul hooks the biggest of the fish we caught and it's a drummer..... and a nice one....    Then it's my turn with a decent cat....    The rain started to come down and it looked as if it would past but decide to go back to the launch..... We started our way only to find in the distance, the storm was at full force, so we made a u-turn and seek cover under the bridge.  When the rain finally subsided, we went back to the falls and as soon as we dropped the anchor I caught a 12"" eye    We did manage to catch a few rock bass but all in all was a good time. All fish were released  Until next time! Leechman"
233552,Mike the Pike,2008-07-28 02:46:00,3421,Great mini report Jacques its always safer to head back in but I find too many of my trips this year ended early because of the darn thunderstorms  Are you fishing really close to Ottawa?  
233557,Leecher,2008-07-28 02:57:00,7832,"Thanks Mike,  We tried to go back but from the distance couldn't see anything, it was white so we did a u-turn and hide under the MacDonald Carter bridge and yes we do.  Jacques"

233593,Rich,2008-07-28 10:08:00,3927,"Nice pics and great report.  Out of curiosity, how big do the channel cats get there?  A river pushing that much water should be a big cat factory in the spring."
