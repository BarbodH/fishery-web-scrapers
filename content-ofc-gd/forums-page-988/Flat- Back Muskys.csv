The largest musky I have ever seen (landed by a friend in my boat) was completly flat on top from the head to the tail. I believe if we had flipped her over on the deck she wouldn't have rolled over. I have only seen it on fish we have caught on Georgian Bay and on those say longer than 45"". Has anyone else noticed this and anybody know if it may be specific to the area we fish or common on all large muskys?                                         ge"

233836,Doctrt,2008-07-28 22:35:00,141,"I have some idea of what you're talking about!! I've caught 2 with the shovel head and flat back.  No room to get any taller at a certain point, so they just get thicker."
234019,Rizzo,2008-07-29 13:26:00,4754,I've caught muskies so big and flat I use them as a level when hanging shelves
