224878,Uncle Buck,2008-07-08 14:57:00,1000,"Looking to get a custom cover made for the bbq...  don't need anything special, but it's just a huge bbq...  anyone know where i could get one done?  bbq size is 74""Lx27""Wx49""H  I'm thinking the cover to be 86""x40""x52"" just square, no tapers, curves etc  must be waterproof, uv resistant etc.. etc... blah blah blah... bbq is stainless and will be left outside year round  any help would be appreciated"
224884,JohnF,2008-07-08 15:08:00,3494, There used to be a guy in New hamburg (near K/W) who did custom sewing stuff like that reasonably. I'm not sure if he's still in business but I could check if you're interested.  JF
224888,Hooked,2008-07-08 15:16:00,891,"Hey Goran, I know there use to be a place on Vanismart, which runs parallel with Barton, by Strathearne...I'm sure he's still there.  My dad got his cover for his boat there, so I'm sure doing a bbq wouldn't be an issue.  Sorry, don't remember the name."

225384,Headhunter,2008-07-09 13:05:00,5703,"I'm pretty sure you can get an off the shelf cover for it, by checking out some of the boutique type BBQ shops. They may not be customized to your Q, but they will have sizes that will properly cover the Q. Look for shops in your area that carry Vermont Castings or Napoleon BBQ's and you should be able to find one. HH"
