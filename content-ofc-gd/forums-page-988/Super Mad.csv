233333,Mike01,2008-07-27 16:24:00,378,"Just thought I would vent my frustrations!!  Had a few free hours last week so I thought I would get out on Nipissing and do some fishing.  I was casting a small x-rap over some submerged rocks.  It was a spot I hadn't tried before but I've driven by it a hundred times.  No fish the first few minutes, then BANG.  My rod just about fell out of my hands.  The fish rocketed out of the water, then dove straight down.  At this point my knees are shaking and I am trying to grab the net, while still fighting the fish.  Anyways, the fish was right at the boat, I've got the net in the water....and the damn line breaks!!!!  I know, fish stories, fish stories.  My PB smallmouth is 6.6lbs, and this fish was very close to that size, man was I ticked."

233347,forrest,2008-07-27 17:42:00,1032,Whats the use in being mad?  Sounds like a bad knot or a ding in the line.  Stuff happens and will happen again.  Hope the poor fish was able to throw that rap.  Maybe you can hook it again.  forrest
233355,misfish,2008-07-27 17:59:00,29133,Been there and done that a few times. Big fish can do that to a man.or Women.LOL
233357,Clampet,2008-07-27 18:09:00,1947,"Well, I guess next time, you may handle things a bit different. What type and lb test, were you running?"
233363,ChrisK,2008-07-27 18:33:00,2772,"Sounds to me like someone got schooled No worries, he'll be there waiting for ya next time you get out on the water !!  Cheers !!!"
233416,bbog,2008-07-27 22:28:00,665,"Yeah, wife lost a PB bass a couple weeks ago and all she wants to do is get back to that same lake and find it again!  She's not mad - just wants to get a better look at it"
233432,danc,2008-07-27 23:15:00,4677,That wouldn't have happened if you didn't have that David Hasselhoff photo in your sig.
233447,MrMike,2008-07-27 23:38:00,153,Better luck next time
233456,blarg,2008-07-27 23:53:00,289,"so if i wanted to find your lost lure, where might one look.."
233485,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-28 00:52:00,2585,"i lost one 6+ on nipissing a few weeks ago.  i thought it was a sheephead but when it jumped it was a smallie, my heart skipped a few beats for sure.  good news is i know where it lives lol  cheers!"
233591,Rich,2008-07-28 10:07:00,3927,"Are you another one of those who was advocating 4lb line for bass?  Sorry to hear that man, but it happens to all of us at some point! It's times like those when you wish you never even saw the fish!"
233608,Victor,2008-07-28 11:17:00,1609,"i hear ya man. Something like that happened to me yesterday as well.  Since i have gotten the boat i haven't had much luck finding the bass, yesterday I've finally hooked into 2 good sized ones and they both got away. One was easily 3-4 lbs as I saw her jump then spit my spinnerbait. Man was I disappointed.  O well, we know where they live now."
