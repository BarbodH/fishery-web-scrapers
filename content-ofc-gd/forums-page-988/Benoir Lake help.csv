I only fish once a year when I go to the cottage with the family and if I catch anything at all they all go back.  It is my second year going to Benoir Lake and I had no luck last year.  I am not looking for secret spots or anything just a little advice so the kids can catch some fish we only get a week and maybe fish once a day tops. Would you recommend trolling and what types of bait, lures?  Any help at all would be appreciated.  I know their is Elephant and Baptiste Lake but I was just looking to stay on Benoir plus I only have a little 14'.  I have heard there is some good fishing on this lake.  Thank you in advance!"

Anyways, the shorelines around the trailer park used to cough up some good largies and smallies, as well as decent muskie.  One of our favourite spots was the area that connects Benoir and Elephant. It is a winding section of the river that is fringed by pads, cane and stumps. This entire area is productive early and late in the day. We would throw topwater frogs, as well as Spooks and Pop R's. Always some fish willing to play tug of war there.  Not too far of a drive with a 14-foot. That's all we ever fished out of.  Hope this helps a bit.  Justin"
