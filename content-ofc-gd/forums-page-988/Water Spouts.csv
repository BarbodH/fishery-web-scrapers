These are for the most part out on Erie looking west from Buffalo. One is from crystal beach. I know its a little work to view them but take a look thru the gallery if you fish Erie and youll be surprised  Skim thru gallery for Buffalo Area waterspouts"

232883,Garyv,2008-07-26 00:03:00,547,My daughter lives on Lake Huron about 600 feet from our house.  We are about 30 Km by water from Sarnia.  Tuesday evening she spotted them before and during a storm that went through.  I've been out on Huron when you can see them in the distance....scary stuff when your going full throttle away from one.

232907,Sandbag,2008-07-26 01:15:00,533,Some weird weather we have been having this year.  They had the snow plows out here Wednesday morning in Grimsby to clear the hail after a freak storm.  Dropped a couple of inches of hail in about 20 minutes on the north-west side of town.  been devastating for the tender fruit growers in the area.  Mother nature never ceases to amaze  Cheers  Craig
232948,Ramble,2008-07-26 02:29:00,713,"A fellow guide got his boat in one last year on teh K-Sawg. Just a little one, spun the boat a half turn, and ruffeled a few feathers. There was actually 3 ripping around right as a storm was bearing down on us. It was one of those things you'll never forget......likley due to the fear involved lolololol  They sure are cool tho.  -R-"
