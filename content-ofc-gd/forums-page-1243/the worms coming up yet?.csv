52033,foggy,2007-03-26 17:53:00,38,"hi there, i was wondering if the worms are coming up in the hamilton area? i hope they are, my dad and me are going fishing tomorrow and it pains me to pay for worms. at least i won't have to water the lawn."
52036,Gerritt,2007-03-26 18:08:00,6129,where abouts are you fishing?
52037,foggy,2007-03-26 18:13:00,38,"were heading out to the grand for some crappie. i'll pick some minnows up , but if its slow, my dad likes to throw in a worm for catfish or whatever else will take it. i'm not expecting much, it'll probably be like fishing in chocolate milk."
52040,Gerritt,2007-03-26 18:15:00,6129,after todays storm... I would say that is a safe bet.  good luck anyways and we like photos!  Gerritt.
52041,Sherriff,2007-03-26 18:15:00,252,I was out on Sunday (in Hamilton) cleaning up 1000's peices of dog crap from the winter.  Many had some nice crawlers under them.  I think I will wait a little longer before I start picking......  Sherriff
52066,misfish,2007-03-26 19:37:00,29133," Misfish spit out beer at that one.LOL   When I left for work this AM,there was that scent of worms in the air.Wont be long Im sure."
52128,JEREMY,2007-03-26 22:19:00,300,fishmaster has worms in dunville.
52151,FISHINGNUT,2007-03-27 00:04:00,253,I pass over the Grand evey day and its a wash out very high and muddy but thats not to say you cant still do some fishing.
52171,PERCHER,2007-03-27 01:24:00,787,The worms are out thick in Burlington tonight.Filled my worm box in no time.
52174,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-27 01:25:00,1351,"same here, i see tons on my lawn.. go out and get them!! i would grab some but i don't think i need them yet anyway... spare them for another time.."
52179,pikehunter,2007-03-27 01:33:00,1659, He should see a doctor about that.
52333,mdej,2007-03-27 17:01:00,98," If its muddy try a MEPP's #2 or similar inline spinner with some flash (silver, gold) tipped with the worm.  Crappie will take this as well.  Drifting a minnow in the muddy water does not attact the fish.  The spinner tipped with worm it cause the fish to come looking for it (Flash & vibration)  Good luck."
52366,foggy,2007-03-27 18:34:00,38," first of all i got plenty of worms last night   ,,,not a bite today though, there was maybe 1.5 inches visibility.  tried some lively minnows, didn't try a spinner tipped with worm like mdej suggested, i'll give that a shot next time. i thought the vibration from a minnow wiggglin in one spot would be my best bet,,,,no dice. didnt even get a catfish on worms,,oh well , it was still a beautiful day,,,thanks for the replies"
54011,fishboy,2007-04-01 16:40:00,550,  so did you lick those crawlers clean?
