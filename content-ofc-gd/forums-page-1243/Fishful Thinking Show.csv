53703,grt1,2007-03-31 15:31:00,638,"I saw the show this morning, as a kid in Brantford the only time we saw cats that big was when we went to the fishponds in Mount Pleasant. I only ever caught small 10-15 inch cats at the dam in Brantford. I always wanted to nail the ones like you caught on the show."

The show wet my appetite   for cats, even though the looks of them and the stinging fins scare the crap out of me   gonna have to get out there soon Steve."
