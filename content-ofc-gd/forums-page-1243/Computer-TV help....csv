53848,FishFinder,2007-04-01 01:38:00,481,"unless its an HDTV it would be pretty usless for using it as a computer screen as the font would be too blurry to read easily, it would only be good for watching videos through your computer."
53855,PatrickGG,2007-04-01 01:53:00,562,You need a video card with a t.v tuner they cost around 100 bucks or just look for a used one on e-bay you should catch a fairly decent one for 50 bucks. Looks something like this as you see on the top left there is a cable out thats where you run the cable from your t.v to the card. 
53876,Deano,2007-04-01 03:15:00,767,"Like Fishfinder said, if it ain't HDTV, it will be useless as a monitor unless your just watching video's or pics, you won't be able to read anything on it, well maybe you will but you'll have a headache in 5 minutes."
53913,pameladallaire,2007-04-01 11:59:00,470,Thanks guys! I guess I'll have an extra tv on hand.  Unless the bathroom needs a tv.  Pam
53929,Steelcat,2007-04-01 12:54:00,191,"Tube tv as a computer monitor is not recommended because you won't be able to see things posted in OFC clearly   And if your computer has a video out, then basically you'll need to buy another tv card for it."
53960,pameladallaire,2007-04-01 14:44:00,470,The box says it is 480i High Res. gaming tv.  Any good or not?  Pam
