I've heard of some anglers eating them, some make them into fertilizer, obviously some or many release the carp. What do you or would you do to your catch?  If you eat them, how do you prepare them? I recall carp used to be the most eaten fish (globally) until the tilapia was noticed and took that title.  I haven't targeted carp ever but have caught the odd one here and there. (Ah the memories, I still remember that 9.5 lb carp that was just under a 3rd of my weight when I caught it at 4 years old, was my biggest fish until I grew up and caught river salmon which still holds my biggest PB at 36.25 lbs).
