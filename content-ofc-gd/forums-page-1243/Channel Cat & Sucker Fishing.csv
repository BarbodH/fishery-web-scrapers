53249,Fishmaster,2007-03-29 21:47:00,920,If anybody is intrested in Catching Channel Cats or Suckers they are starting to hit hard in the Lower Grand River Dunnville ..get out and enjoy these Scrapy fish..
53257,Roy,2007-03-29 22:06:00,13728,Sounds good. Where can I buy bait?
53258,Daplumma,2007-03-29 22:14:00,1961,"At the grocery store for the channel cats.Just get yourself some chicken livers.Fish it 12"" off the bottom and just wait for dinner.At least that works here.Other good baits are cut bait,worms and shrimp.Good eatin! Joe"
53269,charlied,2007-03-29 23:25:00,584,I think there is a bait shop in Dunnville...might be called fishmaster bait and tackle....
53270,silveradosheriff,2007-03-29 23:28:00,1025,I heard it closed.
53278,ch312,2007-03-30 00:14:00,1590,im thinking since he owns a bait shop he might be the one person that hears the most reports on the lower grand? would you guys rather have him keep is mouth shut and not give reports so we dont have a clue how the bite is? give the guy a break  <_<
53280,ryanheritage,2007-03-30 00:17:00,180,"Hey would that mean they are running into most lake ontario tribs???? I would love to get some channel cats on the line... I live close to the rouge in scarb, duffins creek, and frenchmans bay....."
53281,Roy,2007-03-30 00:17:00,13728,That's fair but it still doesn't answer my question.
53300,Marko,2007-03-30 01:22:00,854,There is a good chance i am going to be there this weekend if it does not rain that much. It would be my first time fishing there so any pointers would be appriciated I`ve had luck catching big cats on chicken liver and shrimp in red river in winnipeg when i used to live there.
53303,Roy,2007-03-30 01:26:00,13728,"That might work out pretty well, Marko. Please post a report after your outing. (pics, we like pics.)"
53309,Fishmaster,2007-03-30 01:35:00,920,"Roy i do carry some good cat baits ...best rig for me is a 2/0 Mustad hook or a 4/0 circle hook  with a 2 oz slip sinker 18 "" to a 2 way swivle for a weight stoper with a big gob of Worms or Stink Bait ..sit back wait for the rod to load up fish on ..there is lots of good spots to fish for big cats on the Grand River and im allways open to helping out where to fish ..all ya have to do is PM me or stop in .."
