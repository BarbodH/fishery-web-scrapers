Don (iceguyd) McCaw certainly ranks as one of the more experienced hardwater anglers on Lake Simcoe, and I'm sure he will be instrumental in putting some fish onto the ice!  (I know I can use all the tips possible, since I failed to achieve my goal of catching a Whitefish through the ice this past hardwater season.   )  This Sunday is the last episode of the show for 2007, enjoy it while it lasts!  I think they keep the episodes available on-line still so if you can't tune in on Sunday on OLN @ 8:30 or 10:30am you can download the shows at your convenience.  Oops, here is the link for downloading the episodes - http://www.gettinghooked.net/Episodes.htm (That's me in Episode 12! lol)  Tony"
53402,Smokey,2007-03-30 14:15:00,1278,Should be a great show I saw some pics from the trip on Don's website and it looks like they had a great day on the hardwater.
53461,trapshooter,2007-03-30 17:12:00,1234,Should be another good one.  Don is an awesome guy too.
