53919,aniceguy,2007-04-01 12:22:00,1094,"I have a friend and wer were talking yesterday.  He has a boat that he bought 7 or so yrs ago, he registered the plates to the trailer but he never registered the boat or engine.   He does have the original bill of sale.  I always had the dealer do it so I have no clue on this.  Would someone point it in the right direction so I can help my friend out  thanks Louis"
53920,lookinforwalleye,2007-04-01 12:28:00,4399,"The boat has to be registered,I have been stopped on the water before and been asked to produce it.With my old boat i got it done in Brampton and if memory serves it was done at the Canada Customs office and there was no charge. You could face a fine if you can not produce it."
53932,Randy,2007-04-01 13:01:00,115,Pleasure boats needs to be registered if it is power by a motor 10HP or greater.  Check out this link Transport Canada and this link Pat's Boating for information.
53933,aniceguy,2007-04-01 13:06:00,1094,ok thanks does anyone know where the closest office is to Brampton
53943,grt1,2007-04-01 13:57:00,638,"I got a couple of 14 foot boats the previous owner was going to junk and repaired them. I registered them with Canada customs and about 2 years later I got a note from the Ontario government asking me if I paid the sales tax on them.  Tell your friend that he can expect something asking him the same question.  In my case I didn't have to pay sales tax since I got the previous owner to sign a letter stating that no money was exchanged for these boats. However, the province sales tax people kept hounding me for money and it took another 2 years of corresponding back and forth with copies of this letter included in each correspondance to convince the province that all was on the up and up."

Services Canada is in charge of vessel licencing now. You can no longer do it at Canada Customs/Border Services. http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...services+canada ............................ Was Canada Customs service for free..then I heard it was changing over so you could go to any Social Security/Services Canada or something like that...but note that Temagami Marine no longer goes to North Bay and do them...they fax them into  Services Canada Pleasure Craft Licence Ctr. Fredericton, NB E3B 5G4  Fax number 506-462-5322  required..

53990,JFR,2007-04-01 16:04:00,498,"The obvious question first, what horsepower is the engine?  If it is under 10hp, the boat does not require a registration.  If the boat engine is over 10 hp, then it should have been registered when purchased from the marina.  In any event, you will have to present the bill of sale, and quite likely an affidavit sign by a commissioner of oaths.  Present all the documents at your nearby Service Canada office, and they will process it for you.  The webpage for Service Canada, gives a list of all their offices.  John"
54008,POLLIWOGG,2007-04-01 16:38:00,835,"You want to license your boat not register it, the license gets you a set of #'s for the bow where registration gets you a name and can cost a few $K. I have a buddy who is registering his boat and it's turning into a nightmare.  There is a form for licensing a boat without the proper paper work, if someone needs it I can hunt it up or you can try www.boatingsafety.gc.ca"
54040,aniceguy,2007-04-01 19:03:00,1094,"thanks a ton for the great info quite the task for him as I read through it all.  Someone mentioned there is an office in Brampton, my buddy lives there and it would be easier for him to do it there  From what he said to me he has the bill of sale and the tranfer doc signed he just doesnt knwo who to call and where to go to get the hull transfered over and the boat numbers either changed or transfered over also"
54053,Cookslav,2007-04-01 19:20:00,1457,"I just checked out the Services Canada Site... They say regitering a pleasure craft under the Weight of 15 gross tons is optional. It does not say anything about H.P, length or anything?  http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/en/goc/ship...istration.shtml  You need to tranfer the Licence of the boat into your name, and of course Licnece the trailer, but the boat doe not need to be registered."
