54016,Daplumma,2007-04-01 16:49:00,1961,"As some of you remember today is Jimmy Maurice ""Rocket"" Richard the goats birthday.He is turning 10 today.He was born during a thunderstorm by c-section at the vets office while the power was out.I held the flashlight and cleaned him up.The vet sewed his mother up and she is still around today.His mother is named Lydia and his father was just called ""Stinky"".Stinky is long gone up the road for obvious reasons.Jimmy was first named after a good friend of mine who shares his birthday but it was soon obvious that this goat was much more than a ""Jimmy"".He was and is the fastest goat I have ever seen and he was soon known as ""Rocket"" after one of my boyhood heros.He is also called the Carpenter sometimes because he likes to beat his head on wood and sounds like someone hammering nails.He has no other redeeming qualities but I like him just the same.  Some of Rockets friends; notice the wood by the shed door is torn up.  Joe"
