53858,silveradosheriff,2007-04-01 02:08:00,1025,Heading down to sunny FLA next month and am looking to hook-up and do some bassin'. Any suggestions on guides would be appreciated.  Thanks!
53922,hawg_hauler,2007-04-01 12:31:00,69,"I heard Scott Martin (The Scott Martin Challenge) does guiding in that area and he is really reasonable. Looks like he might be a fun guy to fish with. Might be worth investigating, after all he is the son of legend Roland Martin."
53926,silveradosheriff,2007-04-01 12:43:00,1025,Interesting idea - looks like he is guiding out of Rolands marina on Lake 'O'.  I'm looking for something a bit closer to Orlando.
53944,hawkeye,2007-04-01 13:58:00,162,I can highly recommend John Swan a.k.a. Swanny http://www.swannysbassguides.com/index.htm  We went out last fall about 20 minutes from Orlando and had a blast.    
53954,silveradosheriff,2007-04-01 14:21:00,1025,Thanks - I'm checking it out!
