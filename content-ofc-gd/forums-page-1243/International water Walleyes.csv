Season is open all year long in these international waters.  Follow this link:  http://www.michigan-sportsman.com/photopos...big&cat=542  The Saint Clair river has been producing a good number of steel head, with walleyes just entering the river.  For any of you looking for the best walleye action come here and jig the rivers.  You will need 3/4 oz jigs and gulp minnows and stinger hooks.  A medium heavy rod with fireline spooled.  If you have a chance to fish here in spring dont pass it up!!!"
