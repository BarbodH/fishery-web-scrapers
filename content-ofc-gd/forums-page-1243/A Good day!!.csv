A Good buddy and i headed out on the bay for some last day lakers, We started at 8am and had 8 inched of solid hard ice, We managed to catch a bunch of little ones all fish were in the 9-14 inch range. It was good to see the the lake trout are rerpoducing, at times the fish finder was just full of them................sorry no pics......only a flask!!  By 3pm there was 3 inches of slush on the ice and 5 inches of hard clear ice, time to fly....tip the flask and say good bye for another year!!  All in all a good season...........A little short but, It beats staying home doing the dishes!  Let the summer begin"
