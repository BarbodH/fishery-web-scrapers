Hickory can be over powering and leave everything bitter.  You only need about 1 or 2 hours of light smoke. You then let the element do the rest of the drying."

53797,Gerritt,2007-03-31 22:36:00,6129,Thanks for everything guys! The Jerky turned out fantastic!!! I did some in the oven and some in the smoker minus the wood chips because I used liquid smoke... I have go to say this is some of the best Jerky I have tasted!!! (other then Joeys of course) and I did it all for under 40.00 for 6lbs of it (pre-cooked weight) I wound up with about 2.5lbs after drying..... when I think about it when I purchase it from Costco I pay 9.00 for about 8 ozs.. so I am well ahead and this stuff is WAY better as I know exactly what is in it!  thanks again guys for all your suggestions! it is appreciated   Have a great weekend!  Gerritt.
