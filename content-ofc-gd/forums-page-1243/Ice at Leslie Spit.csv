Anyways the main lagoon was still 3/4 covered in ice which dwindled the area i hoped to cover. Couple of decent follows but no fish in short time. Couple of pics of the ice for anyone thinking of going tommorrow.    cheers,  ehg"

Been fishing this area for past 15+ years and this was the most ice and latest i've seen here. Maybe 2 or 3 times i've seen some ice in last week of March.  This is a picture from about March 23 rd 2006 (last year) a guy Lucid from board and i caught a few. No ice even though a week earlier than now.    ehg"

The season is later now because of the change in weather patterns. I say close the season later. Or just don't close it at all. To all you nay sayers, just stay at home and watch fishin vids till you feel the time is conservationally correct to fish lake Ontario for pike. (if thats even a word ""conservationally"")."
