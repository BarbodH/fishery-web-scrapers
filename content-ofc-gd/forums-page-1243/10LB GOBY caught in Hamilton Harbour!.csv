53530,express168,2007-03-30 21:48:00,327,"This article and picture appeared in the Stoney Creek News today. It is a free local paper , I am not sure if it appeared in the Hamilton Spectator or not. Here are some exerts from the article in the Stoney Creek News.   "" Earlier this week I received a call from a local man, who had been fishing down at pier 4. I got a huge scoop you won't belive what I just hauled in."" said Kristopher Hadfield of Dundas.  "" It was a big fish , much bigger than I expected. "" "" I didn't know how big or small a Goby fish would grow so I called the Ministry of Natural Resources office in Peterborough. This is where I finally realized this was no ordinary catch."" ""Speaking to fisheries expert Marcel Jobard, I found Gobies typically grow up to 25cm(9.8in). When I told him I have a picture of a 10 pounder, he was shocked and somewhat skeptical."" "" I'll send you the photo, I said. Sure but I need to have someone come and confirm this catch, he replied. Maybe it's that polluted water down there in Hamilton."" ""I sent the photo and Mr. Jobard called back to confirm it did in fact appear to be a Goby."" ""In order to confirm Mr. Hadfield's catch, the ministry is sending a Conservation Officer to Hamilton on Sunday, April 1.""  I am sorry I don't have the picture but it is in the Stoney Creek news and o the Stoney Creek news website with the angler and it looks like a HUGE goby!  I am just too computer illiterate to know how to post a link. Watch out Lake Ontario! www.stoneycreeknews.com. it is on the opinions page."
53536,Steelcat,2007-03-30 22:09:00,191,10 lbs goby?! Did he mean total weight of gobies he caught that day?  10 lbs of one single fish = heavier than the heaviest fish I've ever caught in Canada LOL.
53538,irishfield,2007-03-30 22:13:00,26272,CO's coming on the first eh........
53540,express168,2007-03-30 22:18:00,327,"It is pretty sad that you have to arrange an appointment to get a CO in a city of 500,000 people. P.S if you are fishing in Hamilton on Sunday make sure you have a licence, I heard there might be a CO around."
53542,brifishrgy,2007-03-30 22:20:00,559,interesting  http://www.stoneycreeknews.com/scn/viewpoi...int_753878.html
53543,setomonkey,2007-03-30 22:22:00,872,"Hmmm, the 1st...  I wonder what the CO will be able to say about that monster goby...  Mike"

53552,Fishmaster,2007-03-30 22:45:00,920,Here ya go http://www.hamiltonmountainnews.com/hmn/vi...int_753541.html
53555,irishfield,2007-03-30 22:51:00,26272,"Betcha he caught it, like all of you, on a ""hook..line and sinker""....."
53557,Rob,2007-03-30 22:53:00,467,"Quote the last line of the article...  ""Talk about a fish tale"".  Rob C"
53560,DrPhil,2007-03-30 23:03:00,30,Do you have April Fool's jokes in Canada?  Hmmm the joke appears to be closer to 5 than 10 lbs though?
53567,Roy,2007-03-30 23:29:00,13728,Another good story for the unbelievably naive. ('Naive' is the polite word.)
53578,express168,2007-03-31 00:14:00,327,Somebody have some plyers to get the hook out of my mouth!
53587,JerseyDog,2007-03-31 00:42:00,190,To reply to DrPhil - yes we have April Fools in Canada - and you just witnessed a pretty good one.
53599,mepps,2007-03-31 01:47:00,1301,remember that time some one bit my finger off...
53617,Hooked,2007-03-31 02:50:00,891,"Had me going too!  Funny thing is, I believe I went to school with the guy who supposedly caught that fish."
53663,Bob,2007-03-31 12:55:00,370,Wouldn't it be more appropriate if it appeared in tomorrow's edition?  Our local paper runs the odd prank but only on the first.  Doesn't happen too often since our local paper is a weekly.
53731,Greencoachdog,2007-03-31 19:02:00,8163,That ain't nothin'... lookit this Stickleback Minnow I caught while fishin' my favorite lake!  
53736,easton13th,2007-03-31 19:11:00,371,Funny no matter how you look at it...
53737,express168,2007-03-31 19:12:00,327,I have cabin fever so bad that I would kill to catch a 10lb Goby right now!  Man did I get burned with that story. HA!
53999,fishboy,2007-04-01 16:26:00,550,"look before you leap...the question is, what is it?  I'm guessing a bowfin?"
