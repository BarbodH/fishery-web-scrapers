54042,danbo,2007-04-01 19:07:00,2646,I agree with you Paul!
54069,bbog,2007-04-01 19:48:00,665,After breaking a couple of cheaper rods I recently stepped out and bought an HMx. Hopeful that I'll get the sensitivity and not the breakage with this one. Worse thing that could happen is another trip to the local tackle shop - St.Croix next?
54076,urbanangler1990,2007-04-01 20:04:00,933,"thnx guys, i will keep this in mind"
54091,urbanangler1990,2007-04-01 20:18:00,933,"my second option were the clarus rods, what about these?"
54096,solopaddler,2007-04-01 20:24:00,8605,"I'm also a huge fan of St. Croix Avids and Premiers, fantastic rods. The only other rod I'd likely take a close look at if I were you is the Shimano Compre's. I've got a 6' Compre  rod that I use jigging for walleye and it's an amazing rod for the price."
54105,taper,2007-04-01 20:34:00,611,Don't know much about the Fenwick rods but I will second Doug's response. For a medium price range rod the Quantum's are great.
54170,trapshooter,2007-04-01 23:25:00,1234,"  Exactly.  You get what you pay for.  The TechnaAV blank is the top of the line fenwick and it's fantastic.  My 2 main jigging sticks are a Techna and a St. Croix Legend Elite (top of the line Croix) and I defenitely prefer the Techna.  It's stronger and just as sensitive.  Guys break just as many Croix's as Techna at the lodge.  We pound our equipment and as with anything, sometimes you break your gear.  That's where the warranty comes in and both Fenwick and St. Croix are great co's when it comes to backing their product.  I also agree w/ Weedman re 1pc rods being superior."
54182,Gerritt,2007-04-01 23:47:00,6129,Fenwick in my opinion Equals Capital J-unk!  avoid them if at all possible their rods are crap.. I know because I have gone through a few of them.  Gerritt.
54187,trapshooter,2007-04-01 23:51:00,1234,"  Ya, but how do you really feel about them??"
54192,GbayGiant,2007-04-01 23:58:00,1780," I have had no problems with the HMG or Techna AV's, but the Canadian series are crap. I even have a HMG/AV musky jerk bait rod that is the strongest rod I have it tosses mag bulldawgs and huge jerk baits no problems and has for the last 4 years and those are some heavy baits.  The AV's are amazing walleye rods, like others said the top of the line stuff is a whole new world compared to their lower end junk."
54207,muskieb,2007-04-02 00:11:00,58,"I have to agree on their upper end products.  I have an HMG TechnaAV medium/light action 4 piece that I wouldn't trade for anything.  Got this rod after I broke my previous HMG by wacking it off the gunnel of the boat on a hookset during a tournament, not sure any rod would have survived that slam.  Replaced it with a St.Croix Avid because the shop I was buying from did not have the fenwick in action I was looking for.  First time I took it out, fish hit and snap, must have been a dud.  That brought me to the 4 piece.  Amazing rod, unbelievably sensitive, and it has already been through some pretty rough days.  I have wondered a few times already why it didn't break after a few of the incidents it has been through.  Spend the money on a quality fenwick, and you will not be dissapointed."
54026,Weedman,2007-04-01 17:29:00,32,"Well, I think a couple posters here figured out the common denominator in this debate of quality with the Fenwick Rods going downhill after they moved production offshore.  Quality control just hasn't been one of the strengths since Fenwick stopped manufacturing the rods here in Canada and the US.  At the end of the day, you get what you pay for.  I just traded up from my Fenwick HMG's, which I had 4 of and really enjoyed using.  They are a very nice rod for 100 bucks a pop.  No issues whatsoever.  My suggestion is to get away from 2 piece unless it's necessary for car travel.  You just don't want a weak point in the middle of your rod if you can avoid it.  I switched to all one piece rods about 5 years ago and haven't looked back.  Haven't had a single break, or even crack in any of my rods since then.  Over the years, I've used Shimano Compres & Crucials, G.Loomis, HMGs and now St. Croix Premiers. I've been very happy with my Fenwick's over the past while but I do think some of the blanks are a little thinner than others to minimize weight.  I'm now moving up to St. Croix Avid's to match up with my Team Daiwa reels and can't wait to give them a go on the boat this spring.  They're so light but incredibly strong.  Soft water fishing is just around the corner, need another couple weeks of milder weather to get the spring panfishing going.  Tight lines, Paul"
