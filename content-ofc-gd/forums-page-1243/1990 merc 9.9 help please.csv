53865,duber,2007-04-01 02:23:00,220,I just bought a 1990 merc 9.9 with no manual.I have always had OMC motors and I need some help figuring this merc out  .The OMC motors have always had a lever to flip to raise and lower the motor up and down and this merc don't.It unlocks when it is put in gear so you can lift it up but I can't find a release to let it back down.If I reach around behind it I can flip the catch up and let it down but I'm thinking there should be a better way.  Thanks Wes

53945,JerseyDog,2007-04-01 14:00:00,190,"Yup - pull it all the way forward and lower it back down. You have two or three notches of trim which click in going back up.  got two of them, so a real intimate relationship with those motors."

54299,duber,2007-04-02 03:18:00,220,Duhh!  Yep that works guys.Same as my omc motors just without the lever.I was looking so hard for a lever I never thought to just lift it up farther and see what it did.  Thanks a bunch guys.
