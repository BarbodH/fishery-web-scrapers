52194,troutbum,2007-03-27 02:10:00,9,"Going to launch tomorrow afternoon, and ran out of time today to drive around and check...  What launches are open at this end of Lake O? Does anyone know about Bronte?  Hamilton Bayfront or Lasalle? Last time I was near the Harbour, bayfront launch was still frozen.  I'll drive to Port D if I have to, fishing is supposed to be better along the South shore, anyway -- but I was looking for a shorter trip trolling around the Petro Canada Pier in Burlington.  Thaks in advance for any info."
52197,express168,2007-03-27 02:19:00,327,"Bayfront I believe is still frozen, try the one near the lift bridge I believe the ice is out of there. Saw some boats being towed back up Centennial Parkway today so possibly Fifty point or they were coming back from Dalhousie. Hope that helps."
52225,Sherriff,2007-03-27 11:00:00,252,"Pier 4 is still frozen, or was two days ago.  May be open today.  50 Point is open  Port D is open and I think Bronte is but I am not 100% sure.  Fisherman's pier under the Skyways i not open.  Gates locked.  Sherriff"
52246,knotaclue,2007-03-27 12:22:00,136,"Lasalle is wide open,there were two boats out on friday, guys  where fishing from the pier last night, there are no docks in at the ramp so be carefull."
52251,Fang,2007-03-27 12:57:00,1330,Bronte is also open. No docks though as yet.  16 mile is also open but yacht club is storing boats out into the public parking lot so this launch will not be usable till they drop sailboats back in the water later in April.
52560,troutbum,2007-03-28 02:10:00,9,"Bronte launch was open.  They were working putting in the docks and the river was chocolate soup FULL of debris at the mouth -- but the lake was nice.  No fish, though."
52619,CLofchik,2007-03-28 07:59:00,854,"Little late, but:  Bayfront Park is still frozen:     The ice with the nice weather is mixing to create some funky fog all day:      LaSalle is open, though the docks aren't in:  "
54006,fishboy,2007-04-01 16:36:00,550,Bayfront Park was open yesterday; there was someone in a Lund putting about.
