53863,BFSC Kevin,2007-04-01 02:22:00,1351,"so while i was walking and i noticed that there was a little stream. so i headed down to take a closer look. and to my surprise, there were some fish! i believe it is the creek that runs into bluffs park in scarborough. but i was not 100% on what kind of fish it was, if it was a sucker or a trout. would i be allowed to fish for it next week when i pass by again? and bring my rod along with me...? normally i dont target those speicies.. so can anyone help me out?"
53939,Remo,2007-04-01 13:29:00,33,"I believe you are going to have to wait till the last Saturday in April to fish that creek. As always though its good to ask about the regs, but you should always verify them for yourself. If someone accidently points you in the wrong direction I dont think a C.O. will view that as a valid excuse. Hope that helps, here are the regs for that area: http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/pubs/fishing/...ap_A_fr2005.pdf"
53956,xrap,2007-04-01 14:26:00,683,Your allowed to fish for sucker all year. If it was a trout that's a diffrent story. Also check the regs to see it's not a sanctuary or if that part of the creek is closed this time of year.
54000,Victor,2007-04-01 16:27:00,1609,"i'm guessing that those are suckers ...  the time seems to be right ... with all the rain we're getting, next week looks promising"
