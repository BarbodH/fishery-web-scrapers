430077,Rizzo,2010-02-06 02:25:00,4754,"How do the Leafs manage to blow leads every game I watch? I watched the Vancouver game, and then tonight's game. They have made me physically ill with their late game collapses. Big rebounds by the goalie, ride Giguere the rest of the way so the pick isn't #1 over-all. Can't believ what I just witnessed."
430078,solopaddler,2010-02-06 02:26:00,8605,"That was brutal, gonna take me a while to cool down."
430080,irishfield,2010-02-06 02:29:00,26272,Same old.. same old.. it's back ! At least I watched it while I worked... and posted.. and.. I guess I didn't get much done..
430081,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-06 02:29:00,4399,LOL I take it the Leafs lost???
430082,uglyfish,2010-02-06 02:33:00,981,lol yup! had a 3-01 lead with 3 minutes left... lost 4-3!! cant really fault gustavsson for that. the defence kinda left him out to dry there.
430085,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-06 02:37:00,2690,The bleeding never stops...man that was painful!!!!!!!
430086,tb4me,2010-02-06 02:40:00,3295,"Im sorry guys but I blame Ron wilson for this one tonight. 2 Reasons 1. He should have started the goalie that dererved to start. (I honestly belive ""Giggy"" would have won that game) 2. He should have called a time out when all was tied up to make sure they made it to ""OT""  Just my 2 cents"
430087,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-06 02:42:00,4399,  I guess the parade is on hold again?? Sorry couldn`t resist.  Why didn`t the new savior start in net??
430089,muskymatt,2010-02-06 02:43:00,2608,bwahahahhahahaha.....that's freekin priceless  go sens go
430094,TerryC,2010-02-06 02:47:00,196,I actually threw up in my mouth a little watching that collapse....again!   Clarence
430095,solopaddler,2010-02-06 02:48:00,8605, I couldn't believe he didn't call a time out either.
430097,Radnine,2010-02-06 02:55:00,1538,"I just can't believe that with quality talent like Lee Stempniac and Ricard Wallin that they can't go all the way. Joe Bowen is doing his part by saying ""Holy Makinaw"" every time the leafs managed to touch the puck. We all watched the game tonight meaning the ratings are still good; Therefore, we are still a part of the problem. Jim"
430101,bigugli,2010-02-06 03:01:00,6138,I find it too painful to watch any more.    Bring on the Jrs. Far better performances than the Buds will put up.
430138,tb4me,2010-02-06 04:29:00,3295,"Sad news guys...  A car crash in Wayne County Indiana has claimed the lives of two people Friday afternoon, including 21-year-old Brendan Burke - the youngest son of Leafs General Manager Brian Burke.  Details here..sad day in leaf land folks..I feel his pain http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Toron...5/12765516.html"
430140,Paully,2010-02-06 04:42:00,712,  It does not matter what the score was.... My condolences go out to the Burke family.
430143,Toronto_Angler,2010-02-06 04:52:00,698,Not sure what everyone expected. The trades may work well down the road but the fact of the matter is they still traded away most of their socrers leaving their cupboard bare for the rest of the season.
430145,timmeh,2010-02-06 04:58:00,609," Most importantly, that's really terrible news, my condolences to the Burke family. I've never been a leaf fan but at least Burke is giving them a reason to be optimistic about the future.  But it's funny to hear leafs fans not wanting the ""monster"" in net now. At the start of the year you told anyone who would listen that he was the greatest thing since sliced bread. And now you don't want him to play??"
430149,MuskyBill,2010-02-06 05:42:00,311,"After the Monster got hit in the head is when Wilson should've called a time-out. Poor Gustavsson was probably seeing 3 pucks.  But, most importantly is Brian Burle's tragic loss of his son. My condolences...."
430169,eyefish,2010-02-06 13:04:00,135,"the reason they started the ""monster"" was because they play again tonight and they were planning on playing jiggy tonight...I don't disagree though that was absolutely horrible call a damn time out already!!!!"
430236,Rizzo,2010-02-06 16:33:00,4754,"wow tragic news about Brian's son. Puts into perspective how insignificant the leafs/sports really are when something like this happens. Very sad for Brian and his family, my condolences to them."
430388,F7Firecat,2010-02-07 00:39:00,347,I refuse to watch any Leaf games anymore. Nuthing but junk.  GO HABS GO
430437,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-07 02:55:00,4399,"Wow JS Jiggy back to back shutouts, is University avenue booked yet???"
430474,Paully,2010-02-07 05:10:00,712,5 -0 ....   :worthy:  Everyone else can just keep  :blahblah1:
430476,tb4me,2010-02-07 05:35:00,3295,Good game all around there..Nice job indeed! 3 games left till Olympic Break!!! Go Canada Go!!!!!!!!
