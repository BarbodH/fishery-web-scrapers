After thawing myself slightly, I set up the base camp and had my first line down the hole around 9am.  Fish were few and far between, but the fish that did pass through were absolutely suicidal.  In 3 hours, I only marked 12 fish, but landed 4 and lost 2.  All fish on the Impact Laker Taker  Moved just north of Fox Island and fished there from 12 - 2.  Lots of blank screen again, but the fish that moved through were all over the laker taker.  Landed 4 more, including 2 good fish in the 7-9 pound range.  Headed home at 2pm, have a shower to fix.  EW!  Interesting note:  Of the 8 fish I landed, 5 were natural fish.  Excellent to see!   Average size, landed 6 of these   Nice 7 or 8 pounder   Weapon of choice   Another"
