The temperature for the last week has been been stuck at a boring 70F. Tuesday it was sunny so we crossed the border at San Luis.   Yesterday , it was supposed to rain but all it did was get cloudy.   I guess the fish are starting the pre-spawn because we caught two small bass on a Lil' John crankbait.    Buck assisted on one...grin.   Today it was clear and sunny. We got back on the water for another 3 hours and Lil' John caught two more fish.  One was a 3.3 lb.   The other was small.   Still... I guess it's better than sitting on a block of ice...grin. See you in May. Garry2R's"

430483,Garry2Rs,2010-02-07 07:20:00,1425,"No sign of spawners in the shallows yet, but the 3.3 we caught had a very big belly. All winter we have caught what I assume are skinny males. This was the first obvious female and she was packed with eggs. Another couple of weeks should see some ""bed"" action. Glad you like to hear about the soft water fishing... X2 about the end of June. The season seems so short in Ontario... G2r's"
