429806,cheaptackle,2010-02-05 14:20:00,849,"Nah Roy, pretty sure he meant me and I think he is right (except it wasn't my FIRST post, ha ha!).  Haven't found anywhere specific for new introductions, did a search and checked the help section too, nothing.  So, without further hijacking this thread, do I just make a new thread in the general discussion?  Don't really wanna just make a post about me, not any kind of an AW at all!  Michael"
