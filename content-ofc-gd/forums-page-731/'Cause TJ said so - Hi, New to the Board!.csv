429814,cheaptackle,2010-02-05 14:37:00,849,"Ran into TJ on the ""new classifieds"" thread and am obediently following the Master's directive (thanks for the advice TJ!) Name's Michael, originally from the Big Smoke, now transplanted to Uptergrove just east of Orillia.  Spent most of my life growing up (?) fishing  on Dalrymple.  Done some ""time"" on the BOQ.  Now learning more about Cooch, Simcoe and the Bog.  Spent the last 2 years exploring just shorefishing softwater (by choice!) anywhere I can within a couple hours drive.  Getting into hardwater this season a bit more.  Operate  a small discount tackle outlet which just fascinates the hell out of me learning all about what's out there that can't be found in the big box stores.  While I try to use everything I can get my hands on for fishing, have to say my favorite is all different sizes of slip float & live minnows (right up to 14"" suckers) followed by walking sinkers with a floating jig head/live bait combo if the terrain permits.  I probably spend more time researching products to buy in & running the shop than I do actually fishing, hopefully that'll change soon! Met a ton of fellow anglers from the area in the shop, many I hope are also members here too! Enough of me already, I'm going back to the background where I've been for many years now learning from Y'all, although I'm sure I'll crop up from time to time now that I've taken the plunge!

430413,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-07 01:45:00,4399,Welcome to the board.  I have a trailer on Dalrymple so I will probably be driving through Uptergrove every weekend. Where is your store? I will be needing some local hot baits for Dalrymple.
