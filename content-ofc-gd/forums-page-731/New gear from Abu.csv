429370,backbay,2010-02-04 04:07:00,773,"I lifted this from another site. It's a spanky-looking 3.4 ounce medium-action rod from Abu, due for a Sept '10 release. The price is supposed to be in the $US100 range. 10 guides, 6'6""  not a lot of other info.  I think it took some guts to go with a the white finish, though  "
429376,BillM,2010-02-04 04:19:00,17367,"Ugh, first orange now white?  I hope this trend dies soon."

429394,EC1,2010-02-04 06:10:00,930,"I actually like the white alot! Except there doesn't happen to be a white reel in all of the USDM fishing scene! For a hundred bucks, that will be AWESOME!"
429409,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-04 12:51:00,3761,Also think they look great.
429413,Spiel,2010-02-04 13:06:00,9065," I'm with Bill on this one. To gawdy, to flashy, whatever, I prefer my fishing rods to be much more subtle."
429417,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-04 13:15:00,3761,   The white rod is going along with the same role as the Vendetta and Vengence rods from Abu. Their bold design's and colours are very nice IMO.    Young Guys looking for great looking rods.
429439,BillM,2010-02-04 14:37:00,17367,"Mike, does the rod colour help with the wimmens????"
429444,I'mHooked,2010-02-04 14:53:00,525,You'll see a few of these White rods at the Bassmaster Classic in a few weeks.    There will be a number of pros tossing with these rods from Boyd Duckett. http://duckettfishing.com/home.php  These are also micro guided. All guides same size at 4mm.

429486,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-04 17:56:00,0,"i'm sure it's nice but i could never fish with a candycane, a carrot, or any other avant-garde colour schemes..."
429561,fish-miester,2010-02-04 23:15:00,864,"im with mike.. I like the white.. and i have the carrot stix.. and well i like it to.. its all personal preference.. theres no right or wrong colour.. just like some rods have to much shine / flash .. maybe they scare away fish.. who knows.. but i like it.. and thats what it all comes down to .. is to catch the eye of the consumer.. and well thats exactly what there doin I would say .. there are already tons of ""plain"" rods (as some would say) out there.. so e21 steped up with green and orange .. as well as other companys.. now such as abu."
429750,trophyfish,2010-02-05 11:19:00,16,"Whats next polka dot design?  Well said, catch peaple not fish!"
