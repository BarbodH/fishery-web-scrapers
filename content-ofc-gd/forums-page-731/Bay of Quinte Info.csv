429566,Stoty,2010-02-04 23:31:00,2910,"Hey everyone,  I've noticed there's been a lot of questions about the Bay of Quinte recently. Just thought I'd share some info since I am on it all the time.  There is lots if safe ice out there, but also lots of unsafe areas too. Always spud on the way out to be sure.  I've heard of good fish being caught all over the place from Belleville to Deseronto.  We had another 20+ fish day with the fish ranging from 2-8lbs. We have had all our success fishing flats adjacent to deeper water. Were fishing the 24-28 ft range and getting ALL of our fish on Northland Macho Minnows and Buckshots tipped with live minnows.  If you can get your hands on any of those, grab them!! Every store I've been to (including Bass Pro) is completely sold out.  Overall the ice is pretty good, but always always be safe!"
