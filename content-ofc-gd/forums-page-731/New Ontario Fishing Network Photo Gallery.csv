To enter, all ya have to do is register at the site (to make thing easy use your same user id as here if you want), and at the end of March Ill pick 5 users at random and the winners will get an OFC Hat, T-shirt and any other swag I can dig up.  So drop by and register and upload a few photos!!  http://www.ontariofishing.ca/media  Thanks for everyone's help with beta testing as well...
