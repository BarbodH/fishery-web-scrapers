429476,JohnF,2010-02-04 16:39:00,3494,"Dunno if I've got this right cuz I've never initiated a poll before but here goes:  There's a thread on the go now about grip and cranking style that's getting lots of input. It would be interesting, for me at least, if we do a head count on methodology.  JF"
429480,Spiel,2010-02-04 17:13:00,9065,"What about the ""I can cast and retrieve efficiently with either hand"" option."
429481,vance,2010-02-04 17:22:00,719,I can cast farther with my right arm but I am more accurate with my left and I am always switch casting depending on where I am in the boat and who is around me.I haven't used a spinning rod near a much as a bait caster and one thing good about spinning reels is the ability to move the crank to either side so that switching hands is not an issue. By the way I am right handed.   vance
429487,dannyboy,2010-02-04 17:58:00,367,You should include whether the caster is left or right handed to avoid a skew in your data by us sinister folk.  Dan
429492,Raf,2010-02-04 18:06:00,3495,"i am lefthanded (writing, throwing, hockey etc) but I cast with my right and reel with left baitcast or spinning.  so am i the weird one? hahah  could not imagine casting with left hand.  not that there's anything wrong with it."
429493,LucG,2010-02-04 18:09:00,779,"Now we have two posts I'll have to follow...lol   jk  Great Poll, but yeah, it should identify lefty from righty."
429497,John,2010-02-04 18:17:00,2956,"Cast right, crank left....anything else seems, well, wrong."
429500,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-04 18:28:00,10439,Cast and Crank Left. Baseball was tough for me too as I caught and threw with my left as well.
429501,JohnF,2010-02-04 18:38:00,3494, I didn't figger handedness was relevant here given the variety of tsyles used by right handers alone.  JF
429502,Leecher,2010-02-04 18:53:00,7832,I cast left and reel right.... I don't own a baitcaster so this is for spinning outfit only.
429504,bigugli,2010-02-04 18:58:00,6138,Completely ambidextrous with the bait caster.
429505,JohnF,2010-02-04 18:58:00,3494, I just knew there'd be someone like you show up.  JF
429508,Leecher,2010-02-04 19:06:00,7832, Yes I'm weird John
429633,walleyejigger,2010-02-05 01:30:00,876,"i'm a lefty on all counts, but can manage righty if needed"
429638,Rizzo,2010-02-05 01:44:00,4754,"man what a bunch of suckers you are. I have someone cast for me, start the retrieve and then pass it off when a fish hits...the whole cast/retrieve is waaay to much work"
429674,splashhopper,2010-02-05 02:41:00,2931,"Damnnnn,.. John..... just when i almost lost my OBSESSION for soft water... u gotta bring up CASTING  I am trying to  "" be excited"" about catching panfish...   I am really trying.,.,.,, maybe when i catch something bigger under the ice... soon i hope... will i really get EXCITED .... in the mean time...i will keep on jiggin"

429683,kickingfrog,2010-02-05 02:55:00,8333,I bet the numbers would look a little different if it was Americans only answering this poll.
429761,JPD,2010-02-05 12:44:00,296,Same goes for me. I  can cast with either hand but always reel baitcasting with the right and spinning with the left.  Whenever I try to reel a baitcaster left handed I end up spinning the rod not the handle! Spinning reels are easier to reel with the opposite hand for some reason... don't ask me why... it just works out that way for me.
429770,Roy,2010-02-05 12:58:00,13728, Dyna balance.
429775,dave524,2010-02-05 13:04:00,4508," When spinning gear was fairly new to North America in the fifties and early sixties, it was not unusual to see people that had been brought up using bait casting gear and cranking with the right hand actually switch hands with spinning gear and with the spinning reel on top of the rod reeling backwards to retrieve. Same problem, different era"
429799,JohnF,2010-02-05 14:09:00,3494, That's as good an explanation for CRCR as I've seen yet.  And I notice the CRCL contingent is forging ahead again in the BC dept. Last night I thought the traditional CRCRers were overtaking us. Frankly I think the poll will favour the CRCR types if the numbers get high enuf. Apparently it's just us lefty crankers who are paying attention.  JF
429839,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-05 15:30:00,4399,  Glad to see you are one of the normai ones JP!!
429847,Rich Clemens,2010-02-05 15:58:00,3131,Hey .... We're Winning.    Cast Right / Crank Left.
429901,JohnF,2010-02-05 18:22:00,3494, That's very strange because usually the smarter people are in the minority.  JF
