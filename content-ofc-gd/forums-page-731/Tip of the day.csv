Instead, use a pocket knife and cut a small 'X' around 2""x2"" seal in the center of the to get your bait out of. If the vacuum seal is intact the container lids don't seem to leak.

430059,mbosh1980,2010-02-06 01:35:00,349,good tips!
430069,IndySKS,2010-02-06 02:02:00,134,Or just put them in a jar that don't leak............ small peanut butter jars work great.  I tried the tip about leaving the vacuum seal under the lid and just cutting a small hole in it but the tubs are such an awkward size for tackle bags it was just easier to put them in something else.
430151,SlowPoke,2010-02-06 06:10:00,2984,"I do that as well and it can cause more of a mess sometimes. If the tub get tilted or upside down, that juicy goodness doesn't always drain back into the tub and you wear it. I don't know why they didn't do a taller, skinnier tub that would fit in a cupholder. The bait floats, it's not like trying to get the last pickle out of the jar. Those new tubs that look like somebody stepped on; that's hardly an improvement."
430445,fish-miester,2010-02-07 03:14:00,864,i agree with all of thees.. I personally cut a small x in the top and then i put an elastic band around the bottom threads on the container.. i find it ups the seal even more
