I have a trip booked next july for some west coast deep sea fishin... I think we will be targeting tuna mostly, but the odd Marlin does get caught I guess !"

410849,Moosebunk,2009-12-11 03:47:00,3970,"  Ya see... char were my dream for as long as fishing has been more than just a hobby.  And yes... it's not just about the fish sometimes, but where you end up going to catch them.  It was by weird circumstances that I actually ended up on the Tree River as it was an Ungava trip that fell through.  And, having been there and caught those char... it's still mind-boggling to me how often I continue to dream and think about that paradise in the arctic, and its fish that are the greatest of their kind in the world and so unbelievably beautiful.  It's funny how as I was just driving home from work in the blowing snow tonight, I was reliving Bren's and my boat ride out to the Arctic Ocean where we gazed at a sun that just wouldn't quite set... And yesterday, our copy of Arctic Lure from Plummer's came in the mail and I was thinking about the fishing there, and how Bren and I were really blessed to catch what we did.  Man, it's totally perfect to have shared that trip with Bren as well... problem is, I mention fishing trip with her and back to Great Bear and the Tree is where she wants to go.  Over the years I've had some big hard-ons for purely amazing fish like sailfish, sturgeon, marlin and speckles, but none of these caught by me in any of those great experiences could ever surpass the char experience at the oasis in Coronation Gulf known as the Tree River.  I don't have a ""single"" new fish to dream about since those two nights on the edge of the universe at Tree.  If you have a dream fish... and you haven't caught it... get busy making it happen.  Cause experiences like that you can take to the grave and beyond."
410853,mistyriver1,2009-12-11 03:58:00,600," Ron. I'm about 40 minutes from the Fraser right now.  I'm out here on business, second time in the past three months.  I will get back here and it is on my ""to do"" list.  I'd have to add Tarpon as a ""wish list"" as well."

411006,ehg,2009-12-11 20:23:00,2666,Always thought that trolling the St. Lawrence for giant fall musky would be pretty good. Would have to be all expenses paid full week trip in a heated cabin type boat.
411022,Michael_Brown,2009-12-11 21:06:00,411,"Giant Halibut off the Queen Charlotte Islands BC. Just the thought of hooking something that is 200-400lbs and flat like a door gets me going. Interesting fish the way their eyes move as they grow. I have heard they have to shoot the big ones before thy can be boated. I actually met someone years ago who went to the Queen Charlotte's on vacation and never went home. They called their adult children to sell their home, bought a place and have lived there ever since. That has to be special. The scenery, ocean and giant fish.  Someday..."

410295,Fishnwire,2009-12-09 21:29:00,983,"Most of us have weighed in on the thread about one species for the rest of your life.  What about if you could go anywhere in the world and fish for any species that swims?  I guess we'll say fresh or salt.  I'm pretty sure I'd go way up the Amazon for giant peacock bass.  I hear they combine all the best fighting features of SMB and muskie.  Every time they are mentioned on TV or a magazine the word ""explosive"" is used to describe them.  They hammer top-waters and 20 pounders are a possibility.  There are outfitters that take you up river where you stay on houseboats at night and fish from smaller craft during the day.  That would be amazing.  What do you guys dream about?"
410298,trapshooter,2009-12-09 21:31:00,1234,"Call me crazy but I have little interest in traveling far and wide to fish for exotic species.  Having said that, a Frazer River sturgeon trip would be pretty cool.  I'm perfectly content to stay in my own 'backyard' and fish for muskies on Lac Seul   For a lot of ppl that's a dream trip... and I don't take that fact for granted.  I'm thankful every time I'm out there!!"
410304,Fishnwire,2009-12-09 21:39:00,983,"  What your saying is true.  Before I found my spot, I would have considered what is now a slightly above average day as my dream day...I'd never give that up for a single excursion anywhere.  I'm just saying if you were given a once in a lifetime chance to pursue anything anywhere..."
410311,Kinger,2009-12-09 21:53:00,351,"good thread.  I would choose the fabled Skeena River in B.C., thats about as far as my exotic fishing location dreams extend from home.      I would like to target Steelhead on ""shrimp n' eggs"" or wrapped kwikfish. Hopefully get into to something memorable  lol.  And I know that there will be salmon, big, fat, insane, sea-run salmon.

410328,trapshooter,2009-12-09 22:12:00,1234,"  I know what you mean.  I guess I should have said I'm not interested in exotic species like 'peacock bass' or 'tarpon' etc.  I'm more interested in what's available in Ontario and Canada.
