Barrie and Springwater Township firefighters were called around 6 p.m. to the lake near the city's northern boundary.  Both male occupants, who appeared to be in their late teens, were already out of the vehicle when firefighters arrived.  The Barrie fire department's rescue boat was pressed into action.  ""The two occupants couldn't get to shore,"" Springwater Township Fire Chief Tony Van Dam said, adding neither was taken to hospital.  They were treated at the scene by paramedics and released.  The car was partially submerged and has yet to be retrieved."
