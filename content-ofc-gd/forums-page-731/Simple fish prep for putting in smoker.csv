In a separate bowl add 3 cups of demmorara sugar(comes from bulk stores, combo of brown sugar and molasses) and mix in 1/2 cup non iodized pickling salt. You can use up to 3/4 if u want. Pour over top of fish and cover with Saran wrap. Do NOT put in fridge over night.  Leave on counter over night , or  somewhere else where your pet won't get a free snack. In the morning drain the liquid off  and fire into the smoker.  Salmon and lakers come out the best but the whitefish was not to bad either. Just pat dry with paper towl before going into smoker. No bother with air drying, pelicle etc."

430003,richyb,2010-02-05 23:33:00,774,roughly what temp for the smoker and how long of smoking time ?
430040,hendrix,2010-02-06 00:46:00,61,is this for hot or cold smoking?
430160,Big Cliff,2010-02-06 10:28:00,6899,About how many pounds of fish? Do you leave the skin on? I am anxious to try this but a bit more specific information would be helpful.
430176,mr blizzard,2010-02-06 13:30:00,1589,It works best for hot smoke. I can do about 3 pounds at a time on medium heat for between 4 to 5 hours. You could easily get away with adding 2 more pounds of fish and give it a little more time.
