429790,Headhunter,2010-02-05 13:51:00,5703,"Love The Who! Been a fan for many many years, unfortunately once Entwistle died, well, the band died for me as well! Sure, they have left a legacy of incredible ground breaking music, but they are only half of what they were and IMHO should call it quits! I hope they don't embarass themselves this weekend! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FanTQ72IqDY http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4BBQMjbX3c  HH"
429923,Jigger,2010-02-05 20:05:00,1237,"Should be called the WHOs missing tour...aaaaand Townsend should be in jail. But instead, put him on at halftime at the SuperBowl. I'll be choking myself out when they come on. Or leaving the room if I can instead. Like HH said, they should have called it quits after Entwistle left."
