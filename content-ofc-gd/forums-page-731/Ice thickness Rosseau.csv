Second to that I know a lot of good anglers in that area are members of the local bassmaster club. They ice fish in the winter and can be a excellent resource for local info.  http://www.muskokabassmasters.com/   One popular spot is in front of Windemere house. You could check there you should find people fishing if the ice is good.  If your not sure walk and check the ice thickness often. Be safe.   I hope this helps.
