429618,walleyejigger,2010-02-05 01:16:00,876,"that is the question, when ice fishing a jigging rap. or similar lure do you tip it with a minnow? whole or piece/head? onto the middle hook (treble)? i always tip spoons and such, but not sure about this one  bought one last year and never used it, found it in the bottom of my box figured i'll have to give it a try,  thx"
429624,BillM,2010-02-05 01:23:00,17367,What are you fishing for?  I tip them all the time when fishing for perch.
429629,walleyejigger,2010-02-05 01:25:00,876,"thiking of trying it for pickeral, maybe  lakers too"
429649,trapshooter,2010-02-05 02:04:00,1234,TIP IT!  This is probably the single best producer of walleye on my local lakes - the largest sized one.  Tip the centre treble with a minnow.
429661,bigugli,2010-02-05 02:21:00,6138,We tip the treble with a minnow head or a maggot.
429752,Woodsman,2010-02-05 11:42:00,1286,First time on Simcoe this year no tipping required. We had our limit of perch keepers in less than 2 hours. The second time out was another story. If they were not tipped with a half of a minnow forget catching at all. A whole day fishing produced about 15 keepers each. Let the fish tell you if tipping is required.
429777,Muskieman,2010-02-05 13:11:00,2472,Yep... tip the center treble with a small minnow or salmon egg... works great!! RFS 
429829,Lunker Larry,2010-02-05 15:02:00,122,Remember seeing an article once where they replaced the centre hook with a drop down line of about a foot or so tipped with a minnow . Professed to be a perch slayer.
429860,bare foot wader,2010-02-05 16:38:00,1354," this is deadly....works great for pretty much everything that swims....I also run droppers below my jigging spoons....as short as 4"" and up to 1'"
