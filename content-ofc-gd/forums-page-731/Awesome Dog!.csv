430171,fish_fishburn,2010-02-06 13:20:00,1311,I had an Alaskan Malamute some time ago and she loved to go fishing. She would hold the fish down and wouldn't let go till I got the hooks out. Man I miss that old girl.

430195,Spiel,2010-02-06 14:44:00,9065,"Labs are great dogs and hard to keep out of the water. I've always wanted one considering my affinity for being around the water, but when I had an opportunity to take a free pup that was destined for the shelter I decided to give her a home.  She's not fond of the water which may be a good thing as it was easy to train her to stay away from the creek banks (30' back and guards my gear) while I quietly probe the banks and pools for big resident browns.  BROOK....""stay!""  "
