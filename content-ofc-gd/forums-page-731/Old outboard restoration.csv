429667,vance,2010-02-05 02:36:00,719,"My dad had one of those Johnsons on the back of his Perterbourgh in the early fifties, it was the first time I remember going fishing  :D  :D  vance"
429670,GeorgeJ,2010-02-05 02:38:00,207,"What a great job Bernie! I think the outboards from the 40's, 50's and 60's are great and I love to see them especially out on the water. I have so far got a couple of early 50's Johnson's, a 5hp and a 10hp both running. The 10hp has a brass prop. I'm constantly watching them on ebay but shipping them to Canada is a expensive issue which makes it cheaper just to buy them near by. I found both the Johnson's listed on Kijiji."
429694,Bernie,2010-02-05 03:05:00,3190,"Thanks guys.  George My favorites were the late 50's. Top notch quality, beautiful colours and great running were what makes me love them. I have several more to choose from for another winters project but I am searching for a 1958 Johnson 18 HP right now. I'll see how well this 10 works for this summer in the meantime."
429702,Leecher,2010-02-05 03:14:00,7832,Awesome work Bernie It's looking real good Keep up the excellent work!!! Leechman
429709,GeorgeJ,2010-02-05 03:25:00,207,"Bernie from what I have read the early 50's were not as reliable as the later built ones of the 50's and they are every bit as nice to look at but they do seem to be a little harder to find. I put coils,points, wires etc and a water pump in the 10 hp and it seems to run ok in a barrel but have not tried it on a boat. I noticed the shift lever bracket is cracked but still works and where the motor pivots on the mount that it is sitting too low causing interference when turning, it's like a bushing or bearing is missing. Bernie do you know if there is a bushing between the transom mount and the motor housing?"
429713,fishnsled,2010-02-05 03:30:00,3520,"Bernie, that looks amazing!!!  Nice to see how the project is coming along.  Thanks for the update.  BTW - only 15 days!!!"
429722,Bernie,2010-02-05 04:00:00,3190,Thank you Jacques. I really enjoy your handy work as well.  George it's more likely an isolator mount causing your problem. They are rubber mounted and often on these oldies the rubber goes bad and they will drop down.  Thanks Will. Won't be long now. Looking forward to it !
429730,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-02-05 05:26:00,158,"Wow, looks better than new.  Those things look so sweet.  Throw back to yester year.  Very inspiring."
429731,backbay,2010-02-05 05:27:00,773,"Beautiful combo, Bernie, Good for you to help keep some vintage stuff around!"
429785,Headhunter,2010-02-05 13:39:00,5703,Lookin pretty sweet B! 13 more sleeps! HH
429825,Spiel,2010-02-05 14:55:00,9065,Remarkable.  You're doing some spectacular work there Bernie.
430091,Gerritt,2010-02-06 02:45:00,6129,How in the hell did I miss this post!?! Wow.. I had no idea B! Nice little winter project and will look sweet on that cedar's ass end!  13 more days... jesus... I soooooo need a day off! 13 days cannot come soon enough!  See you boys soon... perhaps time to discuss lunch/supper options?  G
430100,Greencoachdog,2010-02-06 02:59:00,8163,  Ok... this is making my sticker peck out!!!  Beautiful work Bern!!!  Please keep us updated!
409247,Bernie,2009-12-07 01:21:00,3190,"Some of you may have seen the post I made back in the summer of the cedar boat I am fixing up this winter. I mentioned at that time I was looking for the same year engine as the boat. There were a few old motors that have been collecting dust for as long as I can remember upstairs at the boat shop. Saturday afternoon I went and literally dusted them off and found this Johnson QD-10. Someone gave it an awful paint job at some point in time.   Before spending a lot of time restoring this one I decided to see if it would run first. Took the hood off and noticed that the coating on the ignition coils had somehow run off over the years and left goo all over it. There were no spark plugs in the cylinder head and that concerned me as it may have been full of bugs and dirt inside.   There was this much dust under the hood, you should have seen the outside.   I knew the first thing I needed was spark, so I started there. Now this little engine was made in Peterborough in 1949 so you can imagine there are not too many parts available for these. These are the old coils.  Improvising can be a necessity so that's what I did. The coils were bad, but I had heard that taking the coil off of a much newer model and combining it with the old coil metal laminate it could be made to work. It did   . Cleaned up the old breaker points, replaced a condenser and spark was fixed. Now the fuel system is a concern because carburator parts dry out and crack, and are often specialized pieces. I took the chance and did not disassemble it at this time. Cleaned out the old glass filter and blew out the fuel lines. Drained out the old gear lube (it was still clear) and refilled it. Well sometime this morning (lost track of time, was having fun   ) I dropped it into the test tank, hit the primer a few times and gave it a pull. One pull, awesome......  It didn't pump water too well but it did enough to run it for a while. Went looking in the parts room for a water pump and found one. It is the same as a mid 60's 10 HP. Put it in and it pumps well now. I decided to restore this one, it may take a while to make it look good again. Original paint colours and decals are available on a website I found. Peeled some paint off today, looks a little better now.  Next is to tear it apart and go over it more thorough, and repaint as i go."
409254,kickingfrog,2009-12-07 01:36:00,8333,Very nice Bernie! Keep us posted.
409295,Bernie,2009-12-07 03:36:00,3190,Thank you for the reply Kickingfrog. This is what they are supposed to look like when done. 
409300,Sinker,2009-12-07 03:58:00,8692,Nice job Bernie. That's going to be a great little rig!!  S.
409304,Leecher,2009-12-07 04:07:00,7832,Awesome Bernie Seems to be running OK from the video you showed..... shouldn't take you to long to restore it It'll make a nice addition to the cedar boat Keep us posted on the development. Leechman
409312,lew,2009-12-07 10:18:00,12766,Always nice to see those old motors restored to their former glory Bernie and it'd be great to see it again when your done.  Lotsa fond memories of the old Seahorses
409339,Fish4Eyes,2009-12-07 13:41:00,1022,"Good work  , nothing like bringing something back to life yourself. Be sure to post pics when your done painting."
409453,aplumma,2009-12-07 21:10:00,6896,Keep going Bernie it looks like a great winter project.   Art
409459,camillj,2009-12-07 21:34:00,1988,Great stuff ... I too love those sea horses ... Looks like you are already well on your way !
409469,Bernie,2009-12-07 22:37:00,3190,"Thanks guys. I would prefer a late 50's engine as they are probably some of the best little outboards ever made, but I am going to try to get this one tip-top."
409471,Roy,2009-12-07 22:52:00,13728,Beauty job Bernie. The only thing to make that motor look better would be for it to be sitting on a Giesler boat.
409481,Bernie,2009-12-07 23:13:00,3190,That is the plan Roy. I also am in the process of restoring a 16 ft cedar from around 1948- 1952. I had it in the water this past fall. It's in the shop drying out now. 
409532,SBCregal,2009-12-08 00:56:00,688,"i want to do something like that with my older (but not as old as that one) johnson that i have, its a 9.5hp from the mid 60s iirc  i just have no idea where to start looking for parts for it.  it runs, but it probably needs a water pump.  and the lower unit needs to be resealed...needs some paint too any idea where to find parts for something like that???"
409537,Sinker,2009-12-08 01:12:00,8692,"That boat is going to look beautiful with that engine on it when your done with it Bernie!!! You gotta get rid of the plastic seats though......all original, or nothing!!!  S."
409540,basskicker09,2009-12-08 01:19:00,144,very nice boat and motor there is an older man in the niagara area that fishes for cats in jordan harbour and he has a 1940's boat with matching motor they always look great to see when done right
409543,Bernie,2009-12-08 01:21:00,3190," Dunner, the most common parts for those engines are still available. Your  local marine supplier should be able to get you most of those parts. If you can't find them let me know, I can get them for you and we have several of those 9.5 in the derelict pile for parts.  Sinker, yes those seats will have to go. This project is being done in the memory of my Grandfather who was still around in 1949, he passed away in 1950. Never met him but the stories that I have been told I sure wish I had."
409692,Spiel,2009-12-08 13:17:00,9065,The boat and motor restoration are pretty slick and admirable projects Bernie. I've no doubt you'll ace them.
409698,bubbles,2009-12-08 13:33:00,591,"Impressive project, keep up the great work and keep us posted.  I love this stuff!"
409732,Headhunter,2009-12-08 14:44:00,5703,"Nice Bernie! That will be the envy of the bay when it's all done and lookin new! The only question is, will it reach Cormorant speed? LOL HH"
409811,Bernie,2009-12-08 17:41:00,3190,  I'm going to hide a nitrous-oxide kit under the seat for those acceleration runs.
409829,Headhunter,2009-12-08 18:37:00,5703,A 410 mounted on the bow might be an easier solution! LOL HH
409830,Headhunter,2009-12-08 18:39:00,5703,".... that or a ""beak"" seeking missle! HH"
409873,Bernie,2009-12-08 21:51:00,3190, Now you are raising the bar a notch Chris. I would be happy for you to come and try it out next summer.
410086,Spiel,2009-12-09 12:25:00,9065, Hey now we're talking. I'd like to make that happen too Bernie.
429647,Bernie,2010-02-05 02:02:00,3190,"Here is an update on the motor project.  Well after a couple of paint ripples and masking tape problems this week I finally started to put on a couple of decals. Few more parts and pieces to put on but it is nearing completion. Here's a look so far.       There is another outboard project going on in the shop. This one is being done by Jim, who is planning on taking this one to the Gravenhurst Antique Boat Show this summer. It's a 1958 7 1/2 Johnson. This one is going to be a beauty. I love those engines.  "
