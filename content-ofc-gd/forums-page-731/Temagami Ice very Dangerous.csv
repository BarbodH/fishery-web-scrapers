429634,Roy,2010-02-05 01:30:00,13728, A word of advice Terry. Pack a wrap around apron for the times you're  standing at the sink. A float suit would be better though....

420099,Jds63,2010-01-08 19:28:00,1365,"Anyone heading up to Temagami in the next few days ,  be aware of ice:  http://ottertooth.com/Temagami/News/10/sat10-03.htm"
420101,mbac31,2010-01-08 19:33:00,904,"I have ben up north a few times recently, and I  saw a few lakes with open water still and alot with sketchy ice. Thanks for the update."
420145,irishfield,2010-01-08 21:06:00,26272,"Sometimes I wonder what they're thinking.. Pigeau should have know better all considered and the fact that there was immense amounts of open water on the lake on Christmas Eve (and there still is). There are many that rip across on as little as an inch of ice to get to the mine landing early into freeze up. One hickup.. water in the fuel.. belt blowing.. getting to slow can = disaster. Even in the sheltered bay to my place I would have walked out to our camp at Christmas...and never considered a sled this year. Last year.. I drove the F150 to the dock, on the 22nd of December, as a comparison.  Good to hear the ice road is at least in to Bear... but anyone considering travelling it to go fishing.. don't get off of it into the snow... you won't find much ice there ! I bet they've been flooding the ice road to build the thickness up."
420449,johnnyb,2010-01-09 20:30:00,3413,"You think even walking off the road would be out of the question, Wayne?"
420508,irishfield,2010-01-10 00:31:00,26272,"Shouldn't be an issue John.. just don't drive off of it. If you want to fish our end of the lake... you can drive to my dock and park there and walk out from there. Doug has the road plowed to my dock and my ""parking lot""."
421028,irishfield,2010-01-11 04:19:00,26272,Still dangerous lads  
421036,bigfish1965,2010-01-11 04:57:00,3382,Wayne..you shouldn't be flying too much at that altitude...can't be good for the lungs
421039,irishfield,2010-01-11 04:59:00,26272,"I'll be doing it again Thursday Morning Rick... 30,000 feet.. south bound !"
421083,johnnyb,2010-01-11 15:26:00,3413," Good to know!! Thanks for that, Wayne"
422040,irishfield,2010-01-13 22:18:00,26272,Shots Ron Miller took yesterday.  Devils bay is still open    3 inches of fresh ice off Rabbit Nose Island finally    Mathias bringing up the Christmas sled..    
422073,jayess,2010-01-14 00:02:00,187,"Thanks for the pics, irishfield.  Those pictures remind me of a question I had in my mind. How do they hook up to lost vehicles/sleds?  Take for instance the guy whose truck went into Nipissing (i think that was the lake) at 29 ft depth. I'd imagine they'd need divers or underwater cameras or something to hook on to the truck effectively and avoiding as much more damage to the truck as possible.  Any ideas?"
422075,irishfield,2010-01-14 00:19:00,26272,Some lucky bugger goes swimming !
422309,Thrasher,2010-01-14 18:42:00,39,"The recovery took 10 days from begining to end on Nipissing. They had to flood the ice for a few days to thicken things up before they could do anything . Bartletts towing in N-bay does the extractions, they have pics on their website. They have/hire a diver to go down and hook the vehicle up. Roughly $25,000 for the extraction! play safe!! Thanks for the updates on Temagami, gonna be up there a few times once lakers open. Thrasher"
422317,jayess,2010-01-14 18:56:00,187, Very cool! A direct link to those interested in the process:  Bartlett's Towing Ice & Lake Recovery
429320,switchback,2010-02-04 02:57:00,10,Any new reports on the ice yet.  Heading up on opening weekend of trout.
429323,irishfield,2010-02-04 02:59:00,26272,"Thanks to snow and milder temps.. not a lot new, but I suspect the majority of the lake is safe for a sled. I wouldn't be driving anywhere off the beaten path in a vehicle. I have 14 "" at my dock, so we can drive out at least to my place. Will be all sledding from there.  Lake was a slushy mess last week.. anywhere off the beaten sled trail. Hopefully that has melted down and solidified before we all get up there.  ""Opening weekend"" You realize they open on a Monday correct?... the 15th...when we'll be drilling hole after hole after hole..."
429379,switchback,2010-02-04 04:28:00,10,Ya we are going up on saturday or sunday. We will be staying at Camp Advance.  Last year we drove the truck and trailer right there. But may not do that this year.  I have a dodge diesel and a big enclosed trailer.  Not sure if I would put that out on 14 inches of Ice just not worth it.  It kind of sucks that you can not fish trout till monday but you can do other fish till that time.  Sure is hard though when you get a nice trout and have to through it back
429385,irishfield,2010-02-04 04:45:00,26272,Whom is Camp Advanced on the lake??
429387,switchback,2010-02-04 04:54:00,10,I believe that the guys name is Lance White.  We stayed there last year for the first time and he was very nice and reasonable.  I just wanted to get a feel to see if the ice would be good enough to go out on with the truck and trailer.  Would not want to become a stat
429389,irishfield,2010-02-04 04:57:00,26272,"Supposed to be about -20 for the next 6 or 7 nights... so if the slush tightens up it may produce some ice. Call him before you go and I'm sure he'll give you the up to date. I do the same for my own place.. neighbour lives there full time.. and keeps my road plowed and parking area clean so the ice can build. If need be he floods the road to build thickness, but can't this winter as he busted his leg up in November...just before ice in."
429479,Terry,2010-02-04 17:08:00,14456,we'd better have good ice........ could be along week if not
429511,fishhunter,2010-02-04 19:20:00,604,ITS A LONG WEEK FOR YOU ANYWAYS FROM THE PAST TRIPS LOL
429527,Terry,2010-02-04 22:10:00,14456,"yeah that's what I mean. if we can't get to that speck lake, I should stay in the cottage and cook"
429528,Terry,2010-02-04 22:14:00,14456,so I am having trouble with this website
429529,Terry,2010-02-04 22:14:00,14456,lots of trouble
