429798,fish_fishburn,2010-02-05 14:08:00,1311,I need some help here. How come when I enter salmon jigs into the search engine I get everything from how you spent your christmas vacation to why I quit smoking. Who cares I want info on jigs. I know there is lots of people here who make jigs and I am looking to purchase some. I would rather buy jigs that are made by fisherman/woman that use them themselves because they use the proper components etc. I ordered some from B.C. and want to compare the difference. Thanks in advance.
