Started the day with Ben catch a 28-30"" Northern. Man, this guy makes this fish look huge lol    So After he caught that I moved out further and put my little fish finder down and was sitting at basically the same depth. Put down a fresh minnow and felt a huge *THUMP*...waited a second and layed the hook into the fish...Instantly felt alot of weight. Still not knowing why I fought this Pike for a solid 10minutes on 4lb Fluorocarbon and a #6 circle hook...no leader nothing. The sad thing is that I forgot to get a pic with the sign  Here is the result, beat my PB by 1""  31"" Northern Pike!   Another Picture   Woo Hoo...shortly after that my Tip-Up goes flying up into the air, ran over and set the hook on another solid pike. Don't worry Team 2 I got a pic of this 25"" Pike with the sign to get our points started!   Then it got really slow, Fish-Miester and Dave caught a handful of Perch until the evening and I landed 1 more pike...a tiny guy.  Pictures-   Dave's Perch   And the small Pike   Thought I would share my new little portable fishfinder I bought off of a member(Thanks man, it works great...still getting use to it though) Eagle Fish Easy 2   Well that's all for this evening, MTBF"
