I decided to take a mini road trip to check out some areas for up coming birthday annual weekend fish.  Came across a wood pile and thought this would make a cool shot for my album.    Anyone remember those what do you see cards? LOL  Cat face    Baby turtle    Larger turtle    Flower    Made a stop at Collingwood.    Use to perch fish here 30+ years ago when Betty and I were dating.    A couple more weeks, then we should be able to launch bud.          Went a little further up the road and well,it,s open,but very dirty. The live counter at the dam was not on,so no idea how many fish had made their way up the ladder.         Well lets hope things clear up and out in the next couple of weeks.        "

That was on the road trip menu last Wed.  Good news here on Erie, I can see a strip of open water about  a kilometer out. There is ice beyond it though. I'm almost to the point I can post a pic, finally figured out how to download from my PC to Photo Bucket with the help of a new laptop and M2B2. I'll get it eventually."
