908719,tomkat,2015-04-08 00:59:00,246,Does anyone use this battery charger to charge the deep cycle when the big motor is running? I have always charged my battery after fishing but thought this might be a nice way to extend battery life? I have 12 volt 55lb so I guess I just need 1 bank charger? The boat has 90 hp fourstroke and I was wondering if it would charge at trolling speed? Thanks in advance

Five minutes of charging on the way back to the dock after running your electric for a two hours isn't going to be worth the bother.  If you use your main motor more than your electric; then it may be of some use.
