908705,Gallie,2015-04-08 00:32:00,1215,"Thats a fairly in depth article, good read for anyone."
908717,MJL,2015-04-08 00:56:00,2427,"Great article. Over the past 5yrs, I've been trying to evolve my fishing and photography around conservation best practices (ie. keeping fish in the water as much as I can). I believe it gives you a more aesthetically pleasing picture and both you and the fish are happier in the end  Brookie by MJLeung, on Flickr  Reflection by MJLeung, on Flickr  Below the ice by MJLeung, on Flickr  Half & half bass by MJLeung, on Flickr  Gar by MJLeung, on Flickr  I don't take too many selfies...Sometimes you just gotta be your own cameraman Selfie brownie by MJLeung, on Flickr"

908793,dks,2015-04-08 12:43:00,36,"Great article, this should be a must read for all anglers! The best point in the article was using the analogy that leaving a fish out of the water is akin to holding one's breath after running a marathon. One big complaint I have is the way most (yes I said most) TV fishing hosts don't handle fish correctly. They leave the fish out of the water way too long while they are yakking at the camera. I always say to myself ""put the damn fish back in the water!"" That's my thoughts for now."
908798,FloatnFly,2015-04-08 13:06:00,1640,"personally i like to use a rubberized net to land fish, keep them in the water 100% of the time and still have a little control for the release"
908799,Gallie,2015-04-08 13:16:00,1215,Its the worst part about fishing shows. The constant mishandling of fish seen by millions every day who assume its ok to do because these dummys do it on tv. So much for leading by example

I watched a show by Italo one day, he was fishing at the time a fairly unknown creek around new castle, not the willy, but a smaller one, he caught a nice steelhead, netted it, and had sitting in the net on the rocks for 5 minutes while he talked about his gear, pathetic  heres the episode, keep in mind this is supposed to be a profressional....

908820,netminder,2015-04-08 15:07:00,514,"I can't stand Italo anyway. Seems very condescending. Always talking down to his wife and the guides. But I'm sure it's what Jesus would do...  Anyway, I didn't see what happened after he kept that fish on shore for 5 minutes, but he is one of the few TV hosts that actually keeps some of the fish he catches. Not sure if that's what he did here."
