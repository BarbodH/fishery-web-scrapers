There is 27"" of ice on the south arm of Opeongo as of a couple days ago and that is thicker then it was last year at this time . I actually called up there to confirm and yes the news came down this morning ! Things could change but it doesn't look good for an early May trip into Algonquin . Plan accordingly everyone ."

907683,misfish,2015-04-02 15:34:00,29133,2012 WOW
907684,muskymatt,2015-04-02 15:39:00,2608,"2012 WOW Yes, 2012 was the only year we've ever had bugs lol. Water was still 50 deg but that didn't stop us from going for a swim."
907685,misfish,2015-04-02 15:56:00,29133,That was the winter I fished the river all winter long. Wonder when I will be able to do that again.
907704,Craigson,2015-04-02 18:17:00,117,Last year they opened permits South of hwy 60 before other parts of the park. So there still might end up being options for the first week of May.
907764,Reel Man,2015-04-02 22:20:00,80,"Crap! There goes that plan. Now, what to do with the first week of May off....  Thanks for the update"

907853,solopaddler,2015-04-03 12:36:00,8605,Oh man we're booked for the 7th!!!  Did you book the lake I suggested?
907872,Pickeral eater,2015-04-03 14:27:00,155, We did so hoping things change over the next few weeks!!
907920,Musky or Specks,2015-04-03 17:35:00,2710,"My first long trip won't be till the 18th so I'm good that way. Now I'll have to keep an eye on ice cover and go up for day trips at Tim River,"
