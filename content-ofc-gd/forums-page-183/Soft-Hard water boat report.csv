I didn't have much hope of fish today but figure a few hours in the canoe would at least keep him occupied and give him a chance to wet a line. We went up Willow Creek to Little Lake. The main lake is still frozen but we did see the usual early spring activity: Geese, ducks, beavers and muskrats. No sign of any fish in the creek yet, but it was nice to be floating again.  Many of the geese preferred to be on the ice rather than in the water:     Thought I saw a member driving through Midhurst in a Rav4  just before 1pm on our way home."
