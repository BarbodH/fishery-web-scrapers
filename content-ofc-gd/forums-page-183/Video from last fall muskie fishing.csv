907705,mistaredone,2015-04-02 18:42:00,913,"My first attempt at shooting and editing a GoPro video.  Good times and calamity as always.  Before the internet rips me up, there is one muffled F bomb for those with sensitive ears and we are using a back up net, my Frabill got left behind  (we were really hung over lol)   Enjoy!  https://youtu.be/JpSkY2xmX1A  "
907706,Craigson,2015-04-02 18:48:00,117,"When i click the link it says ""video not available"""
907707,BillM,2015-04-02 18:50:00,17367,Works fine for me.
907709,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-02 18:55:00,8243,"That video is pretty good for a first time. That fish is a beauty. Now as far as the ooohing and ahhhing, you might want to rethink that, if I only heard the audio I might have thought it was an amateur porno or you caught your fingers in the car door. A bit disturbing, funny but disturbing. Isn't it illegal to anchor a boat to a channel marker or buoy?  Keep it up, you sound comfortable speaking in front of the camera, not everyone does as some sound like they are reading from a script, or there are many ahhhhhs and ummms in guys dialogue. you did great. More please."
907711,SuperDave,2015-04-02 19:02:00,204,My question is.... when did you find a nice day like that last November?????

As for talking, I wasnt looking to do a fishing show for educational purposes or selling product.  I just wanted to keep it light hearted and document a day on the water.  Thanks for the input though"
907718,AKRISONER,2015-04-02 19:39:00,5558,sounds like someone left the tab in their browser open with the porno playing
907720,mistaredone,2015-04-02 19:53:00,913,Really?  Or you guys breaking me for music selection?  It plays normal for me
907721,mistaredone,2015-04-02 20:04:00,913,LMAO!!  You had me going for a minuet!
907722,Handlebarz,2015-04-02 20:19:00,3790,I'm guessing in your settings when you uploaded it you did not set it for Mobil I will check it out later.
907746,mistaredone,2015-04-02 21:20:00,913,"Ok, I fixed the mobile viewing issue.  Thanks Mike!  I'm guessing in your settings when you uploaded it you did not set it for Mobil I will check it out later."
907751,LostAnotherOne,2015-04-02 21:46:00,956,After watching that you can only get better when filming your fishing expeditions.  Nice effort anyways.
907802,Smokercrafty,2015-04-03 01:15:00,227,"Video was good, tunes as well!  Thing that killed me, was the use of that net..... Ouch.....  Other than that, keep em comin!"
907807,Musky or Specks,2015-04-03 02:33:00,2710,Just a word from experience please get yourself some jaw spreaders. Your going to get chomped reaching with your hand like that
907814,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-03 03:38:00,8243,"If I open the link it goes to a different You Tube Musky video everytime, this last time it was Lake St. Clair. The first one I saw may have not even be yours. It did have a different name. It was pretty good too. I don't know what is going on. That fisherman definitely had his boat tied to a green marker buoy, 100% for sure."
907818,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-03 03:55:00,8243,Now I am getting the same LSC video with 2 Reggae songs overlapping. What's going on? It is supposed to be a Musky video and they are landing Pike?????
907829,lew,2015-04-03 09:16:00,12766,"Good video of a good trip, thanks for bringing us along."
907832,Moosebunk,2015-04-03 10:01:00,3970,"Dood!  That was alotta fun.  Really liked all the tunes, been years since hearing Brass Monkey and quite forgot how catchy that one is.  You guys head bobbing and such through it, sped up and all, I'll admit to grinning ear-to-ear.  Great first vid for sure.  Bring more..."
907854,bigbuck,2015-04-03 12:36:00,2449,Nice!! I did not get a chance to wash any musky lures last year. Hopefully this year is different.
907863,porkpie,2015-04-03 13:36:00,2521,Nice!  Love those St. Clair duck boats!
907879,Fisherpete,2015-04-03 14:45:00,1814,"Cool video, some funny momens for sure! Glad you got the camera back.  Constructive criticism - I take it the gentleman was not an expert at handling muskies - needs to be shown how to pick them up by the gill plate without having his thumb ON TOP of mouth - recipe for disaster!!! Fish would likely not have been dropped and pics could have been taken faster. And removing twin ten without pliers... yikes...! Brave!  Cheers Pete"
907946,Handlebarz,2015-04-03 19:31:00,3790,Great first video  Ho do you like that launch? Good thing you had helpers its not a friendly place to put a bigger boat in bit good for where you guys were. Love the early day swim lol my daughter did the same in the Thames for her iPhone she actually got it and it works only took her 10 seconds. Also love the sticker plug great shot.  Keep at it videos are very fun to check out but alot of hard work to make them.  Cheers mike
907948,misfish,2015-04-03 19:55:00,29133,Nice!  Love those St. Clair duck boats!  That was the first thing I thought. Nice blinds.  Enjoyed the clip.
