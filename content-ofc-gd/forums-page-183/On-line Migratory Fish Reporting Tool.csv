People are being asked to report sightings or catches of Rainbow Trout, Chinook and Coho Salmon, White Sucker and other species. Reports can be made directly from your smartphone. More information can be found here:  http://cloca.ca/volunteer/fotr_survey.php  The main rivers in CLOCA's jurisdiction are Lynde Creek, Oshawa Creek, Harmony/Farewell Creek and Bowmanville/Soper Creek. A map of all of the streams in CLOCA's jurisdiction can be found at http://cloca.ca/about/watersheds.php.  Jon"
