908867,misfish,2015-04-08 18:19:00,29133,This Im sure will get answered quick (I hope)  Where can I buy small diameter plastic tubing for slip floats?  Thanks.
908869,moxie,2015-04-08 18:29:00,1566,Any tackle store carries it B.
908871,misfish,2015-04-08 18:37:00,29133,The tubing is to put inside the float. Is that the one you are talking about ?  I want to make the floats.
908876,bare foot wader,2015-04-08 18:56:00,1354,"go to a fly shop with a good selection of tying supplies, and ask for intruder tubing...I have it in 6"" lengths, you can get different weights/stiffness of the tube  assuming panfish floats this time of year? if you're doing bigger slip floats, I'd imagine a hobby shop should have some longer lengths"
908884,misfish,2015-04-08 19:57:00,29133,Thanks  Been doing some searching and found some plastic tubing 1/8 od and 1/16 id.  Will be looking for this intruder you mentioned. Might be something I want for my river slip floats.
908886,bare foot wader,2015-04-08 20:07:00,1354,"look for the HMH stuff  http://www.deneki.com/2015/01/hmh-poly-tubes/  these guys have rigid tubing also  http://www.canadiantubeflies.com/flytying-plastic-tubes.html   are these balsa floats? I haven't made any in years, but had fun doing it, almost turned out too nice looking to use"
908890,misfish,2015-04-08 20:29:00,29133,"Thanks for the links sir.  This is the tubing I found.  White Delrin Â® Acetal Resin Tube, Tight-Tol. 1/8"" OD x 1/16"" ID  Yes Balsa and trying some other things. I just made a batch of floats for the river. They turned out pretty good for my firsts. The cost is pennies compared to buying packaged. Tired of watching good spent money, floating down the river after a break off.  I,ll post them later this week once the final seal coating is done.  Looking at the intruder tubing,I may have something  that will serve my purpose.  Thanks again"

908895,misfish,2015-04-08 20:54:00,29133,Thanks for the video. Food for thought.
908901,Garnet,2015-04-08 21:34:00,2056,I do slip floats with shrink tube. Get proper size and leave about 1/8 long on each end. Quick touch with lighter. Same with tungsten weights.
908903,Sinker,2015-04-08 21:34:00,8692,I use RC gasline from the hobby shop. Best stuff.
908904,davey buoy,2015-04-08 21:42:00,5505,I use RC gasline from the hobby shop. Best stuff. There's one beside Big Als in Barrie.All sizes.
908912,buckster,2015-04-08 22:32:00,530,Brian go check out ideal hobby in Barrie.    They carry this plastic tubing from a company called evergreen.  http://www.evergreenscalemodels.com/Shapes.htm#Round%20Tubing  If you change your mind and are looking to buy some great slip floats  have a look at Coolwatersfloats.ca
908915,misfish,2015-04-08 22:41:00,29133,"Awesome Buckster. Thanks.  I buy my balsa from them and never thought to ask about the tubing being as it,s a fishing thing.  Will stop by there tomorrow."
908918,Ralph Field,2015-04-08 23:08:00,1018,I use straight pen refills. Buy cheap stick pens and remove the ink.
