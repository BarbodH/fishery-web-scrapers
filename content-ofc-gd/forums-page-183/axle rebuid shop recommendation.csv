Good thing I do most work on my cars, so I plan to take out the axle and get it rebuilt if the price is right.  Are there any shops in the GTA that anyone has experience with.  I live in Mississauga /Oakville area so something in this area would be great but willing to go further if there is a good rebuilder.  Would hate to have a shoddy rebuild job done only to have to get it done again.  Thanks"
908921,SBCregal,2015-04-08 23:18:00,688,when I worked at a shop in Burlington we used a place called euro-drive.  they're on plains road just before maple avenue.  http://www.euro-drive.com
908925,huzzsaba,2015-04-08 23:51:00,884,awesome! Thanks.  That's exactly what I was looking for. $105 to rebuilt the axle sounds fair considering a new one costs $600!
