908765,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-08 04:13:00,8243,"Jigster, first welcome aboard. I hope you enjoy this site. If you haven't, I may have missed it, post an intro for everyone introducing yourself. That Smallie on the bottom right is a Pig of a fish. The others are nothing to laugh at either. I do know that there are zones in northern Ontario where Bass is open all year. Pretty well the rest of On. opening is the 3rd Saturday in June. You personally need to check the regs to be 100% certain. Don't take anyone's opinion about the regs. I got caught once for not looking myself. No fine but I don't want to be in that position again. We were fishing for Walleye below the Caledonia Dam in the Grand River the year they had it changed zones."
908857,Jigster,2015-04-08 17:20:00,33,"Old ironmaker, i go by the moniker jigster but at one time went by schnaggs and waaay way back when this board first started (canadave years) i went by the name jerkbait annihilator. Been part of the community since day one pretty much and its been amazing to see what its become. Im a multispecies fisherman but have recently become a fly fisherman and just cant get enough of the smallies.  Now, as for the regs, they're online here https://www.ontario.ca/document/2015-ontario-fishing-regulations-summary. Not sure what im missing but in zone 14 (which is what i believe moon river belongs to) or zone 15 (inland from moon river), the regs clearly state that bass open 4th sat in june. There also doesn't appear to be any exceptions to these regs. I'd love to be fishing the moon right now so please let me know if i'm misinformed!"

908911,Dave Bailey,2015-04-08 22:28:00,1641,"Here's the 2015 regulations. Mods, we really need to get this posted and pinned.  http://docs.ontario.ca/documents/3981-2015-english-fishing-regulations-summary.html#document/p1"
810183,Christopheraaron,2013-10-01 02:48:00,3525,"The original plan was to go out to the Tweed/Bancroft area for a few days with another member, but he got called into work last minute and had to cancel. The problem with that is that I hadn't booked anything, I was free to go wherever I wanted, so I started scouring maps (it's an addiction). Too much freedom can definitely be a bad thing, took me nearly 4 days (the last days we had leading up) to decide between Algonquin, Tweed, Kawarthas, Georgian bay, Erie, Huntsville, Simcoe, Trent, BOQ, Muskoka, you get the idea.  I finally decided on Massassauga, it had been on my to-do list for a couple years now and this would be the perfect time to at last try it. My dad's back wasn't in great shape at the time and neither was my arm so we decided to skip the canoe and go with a small boat rental. Because we had the boat we didn't hold back when packing, I think we brought 4 or 5 duffle bags, a cooler and a giant camera bag, as well as the usual sleeping bags, mats, fishing gear, and clothes.  Here's the view going out from the marina.   The run to our campsite.   Arrived at the site, set up the tent, gathered some wood and set off to finally fish some of this water!  The first small fish of the trip, on a 7"" senko.   We were on fish right away, but nothing of any real size with the biggest probably at a couple pounds. After a good couple hours I did finally land a fish on my skitter walk, which I had been getting a lot of hits on, just not hooking up, my guess is 16-17"".   My dad really out fished me the first night, but nothing very big was landed, despite having some giants on.  Camp sweet camp...  Getting the morning fire going to cook some eggs and bacon.   The next morning my dad got on the board quickly, with a fat little guy.  And then again.  Then it was my chance to show that I could still catch fish! With the biggest fish of the trip at a hair over 20"", a PB for me.   Got a bunch more smaller guys at that spot, even had a few chasing the ones I was reeling in!  A litttle shore lunch. With the camp site packed up we hit the water again, this time a little closer to the marina, and it payed off big time...  This fish could have been the big fish's twin, just a quarter inch shorter.  Then hit another at 19""  And one more little guy to cap off a great trip   A trip to remember for sure, we will definitely be back either early next year for pike or around this time for more smallies. If anyone is looking to rent a boat in the area we got ours from Moon Basin Marina, it's about a 15 minute run from Pete's place access point.  Thanks for reading! -Chris"

810220,Christopheraaron,2013-10-01 13:12:00,3525,"I forgot to mention, and my dad can back me up on this. Before each of the bigger fish I first ate a banana, then, rubbed the peel on the senko, and finally washed the banana in the water, within the next 3 casts I had a fish every time"

810739,Propwash,2013-10-03 15:46:00,19,"Love the Mass.  Nice camping, lots of good fishing water.  Got my pb muskie there. Good outfitters too - a couple on the South end on Arnold's Bay cheaper than the marina. I've had a harder time in the spring there than in summer/fall.  Good report. Thanks."

908762,Jigster,2015-04-08 03:59:00,33,The moon is an incredible mulispecies fishery. these pics were from near moon basin a few  years ago. Lots of scrappy catfish and i've seen some huge gar and esox there... Can you guys enlighten me I thought smallies were off limits till the end of june in both zones 14 and 15?
