907608,Moosebunk,2015-04-02 01:40:00,3970,Knew you'd like that Bravo picture Chris. Hahahaha!  Took a bunch of 'em and while doing so you totally crossed my mind when thinking... who might actually like these shots but me?  Bravo lover that you are!!!
907626,TDunn,2015-04-02 05:17:00,680,Well I think we need to chat on the phone again Drew..... I have a few questions for Ya about the trip.  love the videos and beauty fish!!  TDunn
907628,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-02 05:54:00,8243,"Bunk, you animal you. I read the thread when you first posted it and went right to the photos because I really like you photography skills. Well tonight I went back to the thread to copy the pics to my laptop and watched the videos and nearly fell out of this chair laughing. after the hook pops out you nonchalantly roll up your right sleeve a tad and proceed to stick your left arm into the water, then realizing you got your cuff wet roll up the left sleeve an  inch and proceed to stick your arm in up to the elbow. I howled.  Then I thought you were going for a swim to get that Laker, man oh man.  Of course great pics. I can't decide which one I want to paint with acrylics on canvass. If I have permission. I'm going to anyway. Thanks for the chuckle. Laughing is a great medicine.  edit: I have to ask where did you find the skeletons? How do you think they got so clean, Fox, Coyote, Bunk shore lunch?"
907649,Moosebunk,2015-04-02 13:34:00,3970,"Birds pluck 'em clean.  Ravens mostly.  Those things show up out of nowhere the second you flick a bread crumb 10 feet outside from the hut.  Heck, you can be out there between miles of any shoreline and I swear those black bird-ninjas are cloaked white watching from nearby.  Ling skeletons those are, for every 5 to 10 of those you find a laker.  Wear a watch on the right wrist.  Haven't replaced the lost water resistant cheapo I'd normally wear fishing. The one I was wearing ain't really meant for dunking in the drink. You caught some hesitation reaching for that laker.  Paint whichever photo you choose Sir.  That'd be great, all good by me.  Pamela Adelaire (Delaire)... wonder if she's still around here, and painting too?   Tyler... I might have told you before Christmas we'd talk in the New Year?  Time is flying.  Talk soon."
908477,S.M.05,2015-04-07 01:14:00,145,"I knew you were back and there would be a report kicking around somewhere.  Awesome slobby laker dude, I'm jealous! Tried grabbing that laker for you as it popped off at the hole, but my computer screen got in the way  will just have to follow you down next time."
907007,Moosebunk,2015-03-30 15:46:00,3970,"No TV fishing host material here, the fish are the stars of the show.        Bunk.    Some pics as well... "

907032,mattybculp,2015-03-30 17:24:00,388,"Just awesome man, I really enjoyed watching it. If someone's not hooked on hard water fishing, that video sure helps to start the addiction. Great job Bunk !"
907042,Moosebunk,2015-03-30 18:04:00,3970,Thanks guys.  
907060,Joeytier,2015-03-30 19:19:00,3990,Awesome.  Your renegade buddies are makin ya do all the heavy lifting with the little ol bravo?  That last one is an absolute leviathan.
907099,misfish,2015-03-30 21:08:00,29133,"I couldnt wait to watch the vids Drew. (to slow to load at work to watch)  After the first vid,I was going to ask you about the reel and your thoughts on it. Then you answered it in the second.  I really like that you didnt use any music this time for these two,although I do like the music ones .  How long of a leader are you using and what knot are you using?  Great vids.  Thanks."

907134,Moosebunk,2015-03-30 22:56:00,3970,Leaders Brian 6-12 feet of 10 to 15lb floro.  PP Mainline 15lb to bearing swivel.  Palomars.
907137,Moosebunk,2015-03-30 23:08:00,3970,"Awesome. Your renegade buddies are makin ya do all the heavy lifting with the little ol bravo? That last one is an absolute leviathan.  That little Bravo was made to do the heavy lifting, made to go where the Summits can't, and made to tow my arse and gear-train to all the good spots way out there in big fish land.  lol."

907194,misfish,2015-03-31 10:18:00,29133,"Thanks for taking the time for the review Drew.  If I find them on sale,I may grab one."
907207,RickOnt,2015-03-31 12:35:00,669,Great report and some fantastic pics.  Excellent and honest review of the reel  Thanks for taking the time Rick
907216,JoshS,2015-03-31 13:21:00,729,Sweet report. Look awesome up there.
907224,misfish,2015-03-31 13:45:00,29133,"You got me thinking about the swivel. Your reeling it up through the rod and on to the reel spool? You did say 10-12 ft leader. Or, have you got the swivel between  lure and main?"
907249,Moosebunk,2015-03-31 15:43:00,3970,"You got me thinking about the swivel. Your reeling it up through the rod and on to the reel spool? You did say 10-12 ft leader. Or, have you got the swivel between  lure and main?  Yep.  No probs at all reeling it thru with the Mitchell spinning reels (one of my Abu's too) or this new 13 Fishing jobby.  Shimano 500 reels... yes, a problem to even get barrel ant swivels thru.  Maybe not with their 1000 series though, haven't tried.  Just prefer tying lures direct to leader.  Big laker opps usually keep 3 rods rigged... the tube or bucktail rod, the jiggin' spoon rod, and lately messing with Rattlin' Rap type baits.  If wanting to go snap swivel, I don't. Will go smallest swivel I can get away with to a split ring attached to the lure.  Pimped out several lures Fergie style for this trip too using my own better, heavier and stronger parts for that.  Made for great rattle but the back hook spent too much time wrapping itself on line.  Anyhow.  Line twist of the leader would likely be reduced even more with that swivel right at the lure as opposed to up the line... but who knows?  That leader twist can be worked out enough thru the day though to keep trucking until replaced.  Both the 13 Fishing reel and the spinning reel (to a much lesser degree, but both reels were tested with same lures for approx same amount of time) caused twist from the rod tip down the line while jiggin' aggressively. Worst areas of twist in the line would occur at the footage up that line where I was most often jiggin'.  No swivel anywhere is going to help that really but, twist higher up the line does little to ward off big fish, it's only just a pain that sometimes the line twists enough on falling slack that it somehow grabs the rod tip.  That happens on a biting fish and you've got a catastrophe.  Anyways, all food for thought bud.  Dozens of ways to catch fish eh!?!"
907253,misfish,2015-03-31 15:53:00,29133,"Thanks Drew.  I get what your saying, I was just curious.  I,ll have to give that a try this open water season for them. I still use a short 42 inch rod when jigging them out on the toon. I have always had a short lead with a swivel, but now I,m going to try your way.    Thanks again.   Edit to add, Im sure one of those inlines like the Black betty, would be good, as there is no bail for the swivel to hook up on. I would try a float reel,but would hate to see it go down to the depths.LOL  Which reminds me, I need to get making some lanyards for this up coming season.."
907254,4x4bassin,2015-03-31 15:56:00,1025,Very nice Bunk
907280,fishnsled,2015-03-31 18:05:00,3520,Awesome fish Bunk and a great review on the reel.  Always appreciate an unbiased opinion.
907290,Sinker,2015-03-31 19:00:00,8692,"I tie my leaders on with uni-uni then add a small barrel swivel a couple feet from the lure. No line twist issues that way, and I dont like reeling a swivel thru my rod. If a big fish runs at the right time, that s1ivel coming back down the guides or off the reel can lead to a heartbreaker too.  Like you say Drew, a million ways to do it!  S."
907309,BillM,2015-03-31 20:18:00,17367,"I fish open water lakers the same way I do the ones through the ice..  18-24in leader and go to town.   Great job Drew, I've been talking to some friends up there, we might give it a go next winter (I'm flying, no way I'm driving, lol)"

Great job Drew, I've been talking to some friends up there, we might give it a go next winter (I'm flying, no way I'm driving, lol)   Only extended leaders there, like both of you, all other times just run 3 feet or so.  Thinking with up north, with four feet of ice, snow on top, plus rod length, and strong heavy fish so far averaging high teens, when that thing's head just turns up the hole the swivel might not yet even be on the reel. As well, before turning the fish at the bottom of hole it got into mind that having that thicker more abrasion resistant floro rubbing at that bottom hole ice edge would be better than the narrower braid.  Again, if the rod tip is inches above the water atop the hole and the laker is 2 or 3 feet from turning up at the bottom of the hole, there's still 6 to 7 feet of line off the rod.  My preference is not to have that thrashing fish doing donuts under the hole and rubbing braid on ice.  Good to have the swivel high too in this case, cause if line is cutting into hole ice and that swivel lodges in, it's as bad a karma as it getting hung up at the reel.  Loosen the drag could remedy some worry, but maximum pressure one can get away with, without ripping out hooks gets that fish home quicker.  Again, we all have our methods.  In this case too, it's rather experimental right now.. but working out OK.   Alone or with friends, I like that drive Bill."
