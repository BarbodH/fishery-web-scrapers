A thunderstorm and on shore wind last night, so when the sun came out this morning, tada, open water as far as the eye can see, magic.  I'm amazed how much is gone in 8 hours or so. It's soft water season all. Off to Lake Ontario Thursday, who rah. I will report back for my first day fishing. Gotta get some inches for our team.  Has body of water you fish broken up yet?  Team 5, we catch em but keep them all  alive.  Johnny D"
