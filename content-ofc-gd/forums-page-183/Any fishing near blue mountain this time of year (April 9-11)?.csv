I'm going to be going to blue mountain for a seminar this Thursday and Friday. I'm considering taking my fishing gear but am not sure what the conditions are there or if there will be any fishing opportunities from shore. Could someone please PM if you have any suggestions to try, if you'd like to post a reply, I'm good with that too, just don't post any specifics, thanks Stan"
