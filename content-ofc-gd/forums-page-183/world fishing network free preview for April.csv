908754,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-08 03:22:00,8243,"I agree Councillor. Fishing infomercials, the main reason I'm saving myself 2 bucks a month.  I have been flicking the channel on from time to time this week and I have confirmed the reason why I no longer have it. Wild Fish Wild Places is on right now. There has been exactly 5 minutes of fishing in the last 15 minutes. I'm sure the Chamber of Commerce for the destinations pays them for plugging their communities.  I did have some fun watching the Tarpon Tour thing the other day. It's demolition derby with $75000.00 boats in a small space.  Now the Wild fish guys are in a bar drinking Pecan Punch.......ah man o man."
908863,Consigliere,2015-04-08 18:06:00,121,Just as an fYI almost all of the Lidner material is available free on the roku. All their shows as well as species and technique DVDs. All free. The shows I think you can stream from their site but not the DVDs. The are still selling stuff but I find provide the most insight into when where and why questions. Plus they are former Spoonpluggers so they know what makes a fish tick.
908161,netminder,2015-04-05 03:54:00,514,Randomly clicked on it tonight when going through the guide and it actually came on! Did some googling and turns out it's actually on free preview for April in Canada. Just an FYI for anyone who doesn't have it in their cable package already.
908163,Smokercrafty,2015-04-05 04:12:00,227,Always wanted to check this out before buying......   Thanks for the heads up
908179,Gallie,2015-04-05 13:29:00,1215,"If you like bass fishing, bonefish fishing, and anything related to fly fishing then this is the station for you! I have had it for years and probably watch it once or twice a month max. Im kind of picky though so i imagine some people will like it just dont expect to like it all."
908184,Smokercrafty,2015-04-05 14:15:00,227,"I hear you there esox, I could care less for any saltwater or fly fishing, and if it's primarily that, then I wouldn't purchase. Although I can tell you this, I've recorded every series of freshwater episode so far!! Good for the PVR bank!"
908185,davey buoy,2015-04-05 14:18:00,5505,"For the most part I like it,early mornings,and nothing else on,usually pretty good overall.I'm sure you will find a few shows that will appeal to you!"
908298,BillM,2015-04-06 01:32:00,17367,Bell needs to offer WFN in HD.
908311,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-06 04:00:00,8243,"Most of the low production quality shows aren't filmed in HD anyway. Now I remember why I cancelled WFN. Thanks for reminding me. The only show I ever liked was Lunkerville. The host Mike Avilla is a everyday fishing guy like some of us. Mike doesn't wear a shirt with a bunch of sponsors logos on it, he isn't very good at fishing and admits it. He doesn't edit out his backlashes. He asks the experts the questions some may think are stupid and would never ask for fear they look stupid. And he doesn't sell anything on his show like Cooper Tires and Rappala everything.  I like Mike."
908317,Shloim,2015-04-06 11:10:00,515,"I have it and there are a few shows I PVR and watch so that I can fast forward through the commercials and adds. My favorite show is the fishing adventurer on cottage channel, second is lunkerville. For all the reasons iron maker said."
908320,Steve,2015-04-06 11:25:00,2075,lunkerville is a great show!
908322,BillM,2015-04-06 11:32:00,17367,Lunkerville is the only show I won't watch.  That guy is annoying.
908327,manitoubass2,2015-04-06 12:48:00,11391,"I enjoy lunkerville. Ill watch linders angling edge too. Do that still show that or the next bite?  Somebody needs to pick up thise young chaps with the youtube channel, the name escapes me but they are FUN to watch and I love their enthusiasm"

908465,Gallie,2015-04-07 00:48:00,1215,"This might be the worst fishing show ive ever seen. Shes cute, but the show is awful!"
908574,Beavertail,2015-04-07 16:26:00,331,I live in KW and have Bell Fibe TV. WFN is in HD.
908576,Beavertail,2015-04-07 16:29:00,331,"Yup, still have the Next Bite...one of the better shows IMO."
908582,BillM,2015-04-07 16:39:00,17367,I live in KW and have Bell Fibe TV. WFN is in HD.  I wonder why I can't get it in HD on BEV.
908586,manitoubass2,2015-04-07 16:52:00,11391,I cant het it in hd either.  I have shaw.  Its a bummer becaue its makes all the shows look like they are filmed in the early 90's ???
908590,Beavertail,2015-04-07 17:00:00,331,"I just recently upgraded to a newer, flat screen TV and HD receiver. I PVR the shows I like now and FF thought all the commercials...there's no going back now, I love it! One show that isn't on WFN anymore that I got a kick out of was 'Maximum Limit Fishing' The host was kinda crazy and his show was just a little different than all the rest, kind of refreshing. All the shows were filmed in the NWT."
908592,manitoubass2,2015-04-07 17:04:00,11391,Okay so anyone remember that youtube channel of those younger guys that catch wicked fish and have a blast doing it?  I need to rewatch their shows. They are awesome  Edit. Uncut angling. Watch their shows if you havent seen them
908595,Beavertail,2015-04-07 17:20:00,331,"I forgot about that show! That was a good one! Don't understand why they dropped it, yet they keep 'Pro Tarpon Tour'...what a rodeo!?! I can't turn quick enough when that crap is on."
908596,manitoubass2,2015-04-07 17:24:00,11391,Were they ever on WFN? Ive always just watched on youtube.  Those guys are awesome!
908599,Craigson,2015-04-07 17:29:00,117,Watched a couple shows last night. Wild Fish Wild Places could be amazing except they only show like 30seconds of footage from every place they go.(or atleast yesterdays episode did)
908601,Beavertail,2015-04-07 17:31:00,331,"Manitoubass, you got me thinking now. I have the ""Wild TV"" package on Bell. I thought it was on WFN but it could have been on the hunting channel...either way I don't see it on the air anymore, too bad."
908604,manitoubass2,2015-04-07 17:42:00,11391,I see.  Yep those guys deserve a show IMO.  Maybe they are just happy on youtube???  Nonetheless great show
908747,Consigliere,2015-04-08 03:00:00,121,Great channel if you like to watch commercials even when the commercials aren't on. Every host on there just hocks gear the whole time. So brutal. Everything decent is available online for free now anyways. Save your time and effort this channel is pretty much garbage.
