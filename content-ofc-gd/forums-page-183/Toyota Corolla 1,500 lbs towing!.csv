907810,netminder,2015-04-03 03:07:00,514,"my old chevy lumina was 1,500lbs. but was a V6.  what is the corolla? I'd guess the Corolla is an I4 under 2L. Never thought to check what my car's rating is, but I'd assume it's rated for at least that. Be carful though, it's tough on those little trannies"

907889,BillM,2015-04-03 15:10:00,17367,"Remember; the 1,500 pounds includes the people and gear in the car as well.  No it doesn't.   Towing weight capacities are stated based upon the assumption the vehicle is fully loaded (Gross vehicle weight, which includes passengers, fluids, etc).    Think about it for a second, no manufacturer is going to tell you that you can tow 1,500lbs then in small writing say that you need to do some roadside math to actually figure out what you're allowed to tow.  Imagine the lawsuits?   lol."

Imagine the lawsuits?   lol.  You are incorrect.  Here it is clearly spelled out on GMC's web site.  ""When you use the towing capacity chart, remember that the weights given are maximum values; you should never exceed them. For instance, the towing capacity of the GMC Sierra 1500 is 10,700 pounds. If the total passenger weight is 600 pounds and the load within the bed of the truck is an additional 500 pounds, then the maximum weight of the load on the trailer can never exceed 9,600 pounds, or you will be over the rated load limit.""  http://www.gmc.com/trailering-towing/towing-specs-to-determine-towing-capacity.html"
