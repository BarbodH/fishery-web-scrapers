If you go on line and call the Vaughn location they will tell you if in stock and the Canadian dollar price. Have dealt with them a lot and have always found them to be very helpfull."

Thanks starfield, I tried there originally and found the selection poor, but the store is amazing. I have found my rod through a friend on kijiji and managed to land an excellent rod for 225.00."

907083,DaveRoach,2015-03-30 20:27:00,202,"Does anyone know a reasonable dealer for St.Crox rods. Im looking for the 8-6 Heavy/fast Premier Musky Rod Model PM86HF. The only place I could find it ws at JB's but they wanted 270.00  Thanks, Dave"
907085,Fisherpete,2015-03-30 20:30:00,1814,SAIL carries St. Croix - not sure about that specific model of Premier though (which is an excellent choice by the way). Try and get them during their 15% off sales - which are often.  Pete
907086,DaveRoach,2015-03-30 20:34:00,202, I was there two weekends ago but they only had the Mojo's. But did score my reel at 15%.
907091,Pigeontroller,2015-03-30 20:54:00,2793,"Thats the poor CDN dollar for you...You could try Fishing World in Hamilton, I got a great deal on a LTM there last spring."
907106,bigugli,2015-03-30 21:24:00,6138,My son buys all his St Croix rods at Fishing World. They've always given a good price with good service.

907139,bigbuck,2015-03-30 23:13:00,2449,"Sail and JBs are your choices. All their stuff has gone through the roof with the drop in our dollar. Unfortunately, we will have to pay more to play this year."
907160,Fisherpete,2015-03-31 01:14:00,1814,Dave if you call fishing world and they have what you are looking for at the right price I can help you out - I'll be heading that way (Dunnville for cats) quite a few times in April and May. Just send me a pm and let me know.  Pete
907201,cram,2015-03-31 12:00:00,1733,"270 for a Premier.....yuck.It's funny how prices don't go down when our dollar goes up, but they sure do the opposite!"

907208,AKRISONER,2015-03-31 12:55:00,5558,"thank god i got mine this winter holy crap, i woulda never been able to afford mine now.  also...see oil prices if you wanna see a scam, oils at 40 something a barrel....when it was at 140...pretty sure gas prices are still over a buck?"
907211,JoshS,2015-03-31 13:07:00,729,If you do end up travelling a bit... Hamilton's not that far. Give bills bait and tackle a shout and they will order it for you. They have always had fair prices when I go there.
907214,KraTToR,2015-03-31 13:18:00,506,"Natural sports in Kitchener has a few Premier's at last years pricing.  I was also looking for a 8'6 heavy they did have a 8'6"" extra heavy for the low $200's.  They also have several 8'6 heavy moderate action crankbait/trolling rods in stock as well if memory serves me..  I deal with Nelson (owner).  Nice guy and fair."
907265,PUMP KNOWS,2015-03-31 16:19:00,937,I wanted to buy a Avid pier fishing rod at the sportsmens Show this year but they already had the prices raised
907269,Gerritt,2015-03-31 16:39:00,6129,As Canadians..... We honestly get screwed..... Gas over a dollar... Imported items through the roof......  All because of other countries.......   Gas should be in 70-80 cent range..... That will never happen..... Just wait till oil increases....   We will think 1.50 will seem like a deal... Remember I said this.... 1.50 a litre will seem like a bargain. We are in the process of being conditioned....  While being raped of OUR natural resources....  They belong to all of us. Not foreign conglomerates.  They know we are a bunch of wimps.  G
907272,mike rousseau,2015-03-31 16:59:00,4661,With the exchange rate that price is bang on....  Rollie and Helens in the states that rod would be $168 with exchange...
