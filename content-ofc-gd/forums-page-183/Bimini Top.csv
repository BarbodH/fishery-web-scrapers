908392,wkrp,2015-04-06 19:50:00,656,I am considering a bimini top for my boat. What are the pros and cons . Does it get in the way while fishing? Are they easy to remove and and install? Are they worth it to keep you out of the sun and rain or are they more of a pain ?

Are they worth it to keep you out of the sun and rain or are they more of a pain ?  I find them to be a huge pain. They do get in the way when I fish, but are nice if you want to stay shady and dry. How high is your top and how big is your boat? I took mine off my first boat after about 2 trips out, couldn't stand it."
908401,Terry,2015-04-06 20:34:00,14456,"if you cast  forget it, if you troll, make sure there is room at the back of the boat to set the hook and reel in without having to deal with the top on a real hot sunny day they are nice to help keep you on the lake"
908406,Paudash,2015-04-06 20:45:00,273,"Buy a really good hat and sun glasses instead.  Had one on my boat and used it once, a pain to set up and tangle every second cast"
908409,wkrp,2015-04-06 21:04:00,656,Maybe I will just buy a golf umbrella for those sunny days. I thought that they would be a pain.
908417,manjo39,2015-04-06 21:50:00,354,I only have mine on when I'm not fishing.
908421,leaf4,2015-04-06 22:07:00,2466,The girlfriends daf only uses it in wet weather and when we're fishing in October etc and have a little heater going to keep it bearable
