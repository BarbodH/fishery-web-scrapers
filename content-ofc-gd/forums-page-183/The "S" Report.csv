908036,NAW,2015-04-04 12:41:00,4022,"""S is for:  Simcoe Spring Sunshine Scenery Solitude Samantha and Steve (my fishing companions for the day) Soft Shorelines  But it also stands for:  SKUNK!!!  and  SOAKER!!!   The perch fishing has be tough this spring.  I've been out 3 or  times with limited success.  Yesterday, we went for one last kick at the can.  My girlfriend and my long time fishing partner.  Between the 3 of us, we only manager 1 perch.  Thats embarrassing to say the least.  But the scenery was worth sharing.  18"" of ice, but not another angler for as far as the eyes could see.  Unfortunately, we got distracted on our way back, and in 2' of water, my fishing partner and I both broke through.  It was quite the site...  My girlfriend looking back at these two hardened ice fisherman, standing up to our knees in water...  50' from shore.  I felt like such a rookie.  Ah, well, lesson learned!   Till next year!  Here's some shots of the day.               "

908040,crappieperchhunter,2015-04-04 13:23:00,2582,It was a beauty day to be out that's for sure. Love  the last ice days when you have a whole section of the lake to yourself. My buddy and I shared an area with 11 other people and none of our groups where within 2 football fields of each other.  Raglan golf course on the way home had all kinds of people teeing it up.  Unless something crazy happens this week I think we will get one more weekend on the ice where I was. Yesterday there was a huge Argo taking supplies out to an Island for some building project.  Between 23-29 cranks with the hand auger to get through and our shore access is still a 3 foot hard as a rock snow drift.

Its a unique time of year, and it doesn't last long.  Its nice to get out and snap a few pics.  nice to get one last kick at the can  we decided not to fish after stopping a 5 locations before finding a spot we could get on the lake  I walked out a ways and let the spud drop to the ice and it went right through, over a foot of ice but dropping the spud a foot above the ice and it did go though every time we figured we could get out to where we wanted to fish but the question was , could we safely make it back in.....we decided it was not worth the risk Play is safe Terry.  S is for Smart in that case...  Where I went through, there was 10"" of ""ice.""  Buy my boot cut through it like a cookie cutter.  It was an odd sensation.  Like stepping in to a bucket of small marbles..  Nice rod  50% off at cabalas last week.  I bought two..  Crazy soft tip.  I love it.  The blank is flattened on bottom.  It's a neat design.  Can't wait for fist ice crappies!! It was a beauty day to be out that's for sure. Love  the last ice days when you have a whole section of the lake to yourself.

It's time for me to shut it down, and start my spring cleaning!!"
