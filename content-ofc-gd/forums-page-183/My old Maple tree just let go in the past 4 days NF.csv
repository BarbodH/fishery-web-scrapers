907741,lakerguy,2015-04-02 21:08:00,224,X2 just give it a bath. I've never heard of maple sap being corrosive. We eat the stuff

907744,wkrp,2015-04-02 21:15:00,656,Try plain old butter.It does take pine sap off your hands.

907769,SmokestackLightnin,2015-04-02 22:44:00,390,If it's sap from a sugar maple then hot water will remove it.
907774,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-02 23:31:00,8243,"We have Maples here and the sap got on my wife's like new Altima. On just a few spot not everywhere like you describe Davey. WD 40 did the job, only do a small area at a time. It didn't harm the paint at all, great to get oil paint off of anything including hands.  I missed a few spots on the hood and it took the clear coat and paint off down to the aluminum, You need to get it off asap but I would call my insurance guy tomorrow and report it. If you do anything before calling them they may give you a hard time if it indeed needs to be cleaned professionally. They should have someone on call because not all accidents happen during business hours.  In fact I would call them right now. A call doesn't cost a penny, sort of, they already have your money."

Thanks JD,but I'm that guy who does not want to tell the insurance company unless I have to.Looks like a few good ideas here.I'll tinker tomorrow and see how that goes.If worse comes to worse,I will make that call. I have a feeling very warm water,and a little soap and I light scrubbing may do it. A mist of WD 40 may not hurt either?"

907781,Burtess,2015-04-02 23:48:00,901,"Never heard of or seen maple sap damage clearcoat or paint.  Pine or spruce, that is another matter.  Pine will pucker up the clearcoat after a few days (think turpentine) so you have to get that off pretty fast.  The best I have found to remove pine sap is Zippo or Ronson lighter fluid.  Will not hurt the clearcoat.  If it is only maple sap a nice hand wash should remove it.  Burt"
