The good thing was the weather and we didn't see a single ice fisher or snowmobile and it felt like we had the whole lake to ourselves.    We thought about hiking into Chris Lake but we fished a different spot I like late in the season.     I got the first one, then Chris caught the next 8, Hahaha. Funny how that works out sometimes. No size though.    After catching 8 in a row, I accidentally knocked Chris's rod and reel down the hole so he was done for the day. All fish released.  Awesome time of the year up there. A fun day.

908259,ckewley,2015-04-05 19:31:00,699,Awesome day.... I thought you said a fish took the rod!!!! Marked some big fish just couldn't get them to bite & walked away with a slight sun burn to boot. Gull Lake really is a amazing setting.
