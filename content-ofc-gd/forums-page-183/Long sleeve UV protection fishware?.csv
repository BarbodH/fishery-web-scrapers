908600,SirCranksalot,2015-04-07 17:30:00,3291,How much of this UPF clothing is hype? I have never gotten sunburned thru a normal shirt.
908605,DRIFTER_016,2015-04-07 17:42:00,10439,How much of this UPF clothing is hype? I have never gotten sunburned thru a normal shirt.  No but the specialty is much cooler than a regular shirt in the heat of the sun.
908607,BillM,2015-04-07 17:45:00,17367,How much of this UPF clothing is hype? I have never gotten sunburned thru a normal shirt.  A normal shirt in 90 degree weather really sucks though.
908633,FrankTheRabbit,2015-04-07 19:26:00,479,"Wouldn't NIke/Adidas/Reebok/etc long sleeve dry fit work as well? I've worn one of those in Bermuda during August on the water. Didn't get burnt, fabric was lightweight, breathable, despite it being black in colour. Some can be form fitting and others can be semi-form fitting. Lots of styles and colours to choose from.  I'm thinking those UPF ratings are marketing hype as well. Many of our favourite fishing caps don't have a UPF rating and they seem to be fine as well.  I was lucky to amass a few of those workout long sleeve dry fit tops during sales, without the need to pick up some $60 and up Columbia/Simms/etc.  Here's an interesting article:  http://www.boatingmag.com/gear/boatinglab-tests-upf-rated-clothing"
908650,aplumma,2015-04-07 20:41:00,6896,I do some canoeing in the summer sun and what I found works best is a white dress shirt 1 or 2 sizes too big from Goodwill or Sally  Ann. Not very fashionable but I don't GAS. I have been doing the same for years. You can either wash them or throw them away if they are to messed up. Most of the time they are a buck or two usually.  art
908663,SirCranksalot,2015-04-07 22:20:00,3291, A normal shirt in 90 degree weather really sucks though.  Agreed that CAN be the case. But with a white shirt to reflect a lot of the sun and a very loose fit so that it doesn't stick to my back it works quite well. I sometimes dip it in the water. The evaporation from a cotton shirt lasts for a while and has quite the cooling effect.
908698,Lape0019,2015-04-08 00:13:00,647,"Honestly, I think it is more designed to be breathable and moisture wicking more than anything. I am with you and beleive that a regular shirt has about the same amount of sun protection so that part is marketing. The fact is, the clothing is specifically designed for fishing . They probably figured if we would spend a fortune on gear, why not market some clothes for it?  I know I would prefer to wear a Comumbia UPF long sleeve than a cotton t shirt any day of the week.  And yes, I beleive the Nike/Adidas shirts would work just as well."
908706,musky_hunter,2015-04-08 00:33:00,328,"columbia pfg, UA, and simms long sleeve are great for fishing, the worst are tournament shirts..haha"
908708,MJL,2015-04-08 00:34:00,2427,"As it was described to me by a dermatologist at the hospital, any rating over UPF30 doesn't really add much to the overall protection from UV rays. Once you hit UPF30, you block approx 97% of UV rays. UPF 60 will not give twice the protection against UV rays unless you consider that it may provide additional longevity against water and sweat.  I read that darker coloured fabrics block UV rays better than lighter coloured ones. You'd feel the heat if you were wearing black though.  I'm a big fan of synthetic long sleeve shirts. I bought a number of Simms shirts on clearance and have a number of generic polyester and coolmax shirts. They keep me cool in the heat and I don't get sun burned...They also dry very fast when I'm wet wading.  I'm covered up well when the sun is beaming down. Hat, buff, polarized sun glasses, Simms guide shirt, Simms guide sun gloves, Simms lightweight zip-off pants, polypropylene socks, Columbia water shoes FTW!  "
908713,kickingfrog,2015-04-08 00:47:00,8333,Another consideration for not wearing dark colours is black flies and mosquitos.
908840,Smokercrafty,2015-04-08 16:18:00,227,"Love the thread! Definitely gonna get into some of this gear come summer. I usually head out with tons of sunscreen, and plenty more stocked in the boat, but wearing this stuff would surely cut down on my sunscreen stock!!!"
908358,Raycaster,2015-04-06 15:56:00,528,Every year I try to bundle up against the sun fishing and have started wearing long sleeve t-shirts and a rolled up towel around the neck.  I've seen video's of the cool young guys wearing complete camo setups which I assume offer great sun protection but damn I'd suffer huge abuse from relatives worse than a sunburn if I tried that!  Any suggestions for reasonable priced UV protection wear for fishing? There a few shirts at Sail that looked ok but again pretty much on the flashy side for this old fart. Don't need to look like I'm in the National BassMaster Tourney...  Thx ahead.   
908360,bare foot wader,2015-04-06 15:59:00,1354,"Columbia and simms make long sleeve shirts, neutral logos, no skulls or anything  I have a few, I like the Columbia stuff better, cheaper and nicer fit for me  these guys here:  http://www.columbia.com/mens-pfg-terminal-tackle-long-sleeve-tee-FM6094.html?dwvar_FM6094_variationColor=374#start=10"
908363,mistaredone,2015-04-06 16:17:00,913,Under Armor has a super light long sleeve with a hood in their fishing line that I'm probably going to pick up. A bit pricey like $60 or so I think. I saw it at BP

908368,kickingfrog,2015-04-06 16:43:00,8333,I like both but the columbia style shirts have the added benefit of being bug proof as long as the threads are tight enough.
908369,lew,2015-04-06 16:48:00,12766,"I also wear Columbia and their excellent for hot sunny days on the water, just be sure to get the ones that are vented in the back and arm pits as that lets air flow through and will help keep you cool.  I also wear a wide brimmed hat to keep the sun off my face and ears.  Mine are neutral colors and aren't the least bit flashy and look just like any other shirt."

908478,DRIFTER_016,2015-04-07 01:15:00,10439,I have a bunch of microfiber shirts I bought in Florida that are great for stopping the sun while keeping you cool. I even bought a few from Walmart under the Bimini Bay brand that were less than $15 a piece. Picked up a bunch of nice ones at the Tampa boat show last spring too.
908484,NANUK,2015-04-07 01:31:00,797,"Lot of choices in UV protection shirts & headwear, I use Simms, Eddie Bauer, Cabela's and Columbia brand full sleve tops and Buff headwear, they all do the job, Simms are my favourite."

908493,SuperDave,2015-04-07 01:53:00,204,"I wear Columbia fishing shirts available at Bass Pro. Also the Worldwide Sportsman brand. A wide brim hat is a must, and a buff for neck/face protection. Don't forget long pants, as we usually ignore the back of our legs and pay for it! SPF 30 minimum sunscreen and don't forget SPF lip balm. Nothing worse than a nasty sun blister on your kisser! Tons of different clothing out there prices are not cheap for this kind of stuff but it's well worth it. The sun is my enemy."
908519,wormdunker,2015-04-07 10:40:00,1711,"Lottsa great info here.  Thanx for sharing.  I've never really paid attention to the damage sun can do to your body, except wearing a wide brimmed hat & SPF 340 but, after reading all of your replies, it's definitely changing my way of thinking.  I have gift cards from BPS - guess I'll be using them on long sleeved shirts & a buff or 2 before hitting the open water."
908522,sauce,2015-04-07 11:30:00,219,I picked up an O'Neil brand uv protection hoody at sail last year. Not flashy at all and very comfortable.  the hood is quite roomy. When wearing a ball cap I can keep my entire face in the shade by pulling the hood down over the brim of my cap. even on the hottest days I stay cool.
908523,fishindevil,2015-04-07 11:42:00,6254,I got a few bass pro UV shirts and a few buffs and a shirt at sail both places were priced about the same and they work well !!! And on those super hot days where the sun is cooking you alive they are worth every penny for sure !!! Those shirts & buffs have let me spend more time in the sun than I normally would have that's for sure !!!
908525,reboot,2015-04-07 12:12:00,1,I know of a brand called Salt Armour that sells face covers as well as arm sleeves that are UV protective. Sell for about $20 each but there are always 50-80% sales going on... Got some about a month ago at 80% off!http://www.sateam.company/shop?category=Face%20Shields
908550,Fang,2015-04-07 13:28:00,1330,"I have a nice growing collection of light weight long sleeves. The last couple years I've been down in Florida for my son's baseball training and Walmart has a very nice $25 long sleeve in the fishing department that is UV 35 protection  There is a line of clothing called Salt Life that is sold through BEALLS Department stores. Lots of salt water images but they have some plain camo and color tops as well. This spring I picked up an Underarmor and 2 salt life long sleeves that you'll see in photos this year for sure.  BEALLS also has a line up called REEL LEGENDS and stuff is priced well. Easy enough to order as well, just like ordering from BPS online  here's one that's on sale right now at BEALLS  http://www.beallsflorida.com/online/reel-legends-mens-freeline-graphic-camo-t-shirt"

Absolutely lovd the stain resistant quality of my Colunbia Blood N Guts shirt  though. Small price to pay to avoid the undeniable damage the sun will do. Advantageous to wearing too much sunblock which will probably be found to pose its own risks"
908573,Lape0019,2015-04-07 16:24:00,647,I have a Columbia UPF long sleeve hoodie for the top and a pair of Under Armour guide wear pants. I will be trying out a Under armour Buff thing this year as well.  Glacier glove also makes a glove for summer UV protection. I know a few guys that wear them and they say they are comfy. I just have not gotten to that point yet.
