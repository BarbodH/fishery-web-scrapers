233024,dsn,2008-07-26 12:32:00,1018,     AS you can see there are some big fish in there !                         These shots turned out pretty good so I'll be adding them to my files.   DSN  Enjoy your day!! Cause it might rain the next.
233031,JohnF,2008-07-26 13:00:00,3494,So would a group of about 30 or 40 carp milling about on the surface in 4-5' of water be spawning. Please say no because when we were kids we thought that was very cool to wade in amongst them and let them splash and writhe all around our chests and chins. We'd ease up close to the school in a boat and then slip overboard and join the party. Kinda sours the memory if in fact we were wallowing in fishy fornication.  JF
233033,Rich,2008-07-26 13:05:00,3927,They're just spawning NOW? Where were these pics taken?
233038,MrMike,2008-07-26 13:31:00,153,neat
233060,Marko,2008-07-26 14:19:00,854,Those are pretty awesome shots!! They have been doing that for weeks in this lake where i chase them. Carp fishing has been really weird this summer.  John what are u doing swimming with carp lol
233070,Victor,2008-07-26 14:51:00,1609,Very neat shots dsn. I hope that they're done soon ... it's been a while already and I need a carp fix BAD.  JohnF    ... I didn't know you're into that stuff. LOL
233075,Leecher,2008-07-26 15:01:00,7832,"Good job dsn, the pics sure turned out great  Thanks for sharing Leechman"
233088,JohnF,2008-07-26 15:33:00,3494," I didn't either. I was about 12 or 13 at the time. It seemed like a fun thing. Who knew about the procreative process, and how messy it got. I'm thinking seriously about going for another shower right now.  We also used to catch little snakes and hide them under our shirts so the warmth would keep them calm. We needed them for snake bombs to get even with the boaters who messed with us. I suppose next someone's gonna tell me the little beggars were fornicating in my shirt.  JF"
233111,Photoz,2008-07-26 17:41:00,792,"Carp spawn when the water temps reach the high 60's. I've caught 'em, spilling roe all over the boardwalk at the ol' Lakeview plant in early August, about 5 years ago when we had another wet, cool summer! In the shallower lakes & tribs, the water will get up to temp as early as late May, but in Lake Ontario, only the small bays and creek & rivermouths will be much more that the mid-60's even at this late date."
233115,highdrifter,2008-07-26 17:52:00,2534,OMG.  Talk about carp boner land!!  This is supposed to be a family site!!  HAHAH HD
233153,JohnF,2008-07-26 19:50:00,3494, EEEWWW!!!! I thought those were little fins.  JF
233166,TJQ,2008-07-26 21:18:00,7806, hahahahahahahaaaaaaaa!!!
233202,Rich,2008-07-26 23:59:00,3927,"They start spawning my local Lake Erie tribs in late April/Early May most years, full fledged spawn by early June and I've never seen them still spawning past July. Just weird for me but I guess Lake O is a much cooler lake."
233203,Mike the Pike,2008-07-27 00:03:00,3421,Ah imagine all those fin fights for the female  Great shots man so when you ahavin little ones
