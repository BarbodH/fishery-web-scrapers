232931,e-z-out,2008-07-26 02:11:00,1052,Just wanted to know if anyone has ever used them? Do they really work and how easy are they to fish with? I've seen them on TV all the time just wanted some feed back from some of the OFC community.
232953,addict,2008-07-26 02:47:00,475,"used them a couple of times recived them as a gift,had good success twitching them through lillie pads.but im sure other soft swimbaits would work just as well only cheaper."
232961,Moosebunk,2008-07-26 03:06:00,3970,I bought some of these probably near 15 years ago.  I never caught a fish with 'em.  Handed one to a buddy one time and he caught one fish with it right away. lol.  They're still garbage.
232972,Tinman,2008-07-26 03:21:00,376,i saw them for sale at bass pro shop last weekend
233032,e-z-out,2008-07-26 13:04:00,1052,Thanks guys i guess i should try them out myself and see if they really do work. I guess i'll be hitting up BPS later today and give them a test. Thanks again for the info guys
233034,Terry,2008-07-26 13:08:00,14456,I would not waste my  money on them
233035,Rich,2008-07-26 13:16:00,3927,I'd buy them again because I miss that awesome video included with the fishing kit.. that was the best comedy I ever saw!
233043,MrMike,2008-07-26 13:37:00,153,yes there sure are some real dumb vidios out there
233048,wuchikubo,2008-07-26 13:43:00,1114,"I've had some follows with them but never any hits, I would suggest spraying or coating them with scent if you plan to use it, I think the plastic smells too artificial for the fish."
233283,bigcreekdad,2008-07-27 12:37:00,546,"Like a fool, I bought some a couple of years ago. Should have kown that anything ""The Babe"" was touting would have to be worthless. Now I use them, but only as a joke....I bring them along on our fly in trips for brookies and lakers. I don't use then, but just lay them out with our gear before we head out.....always gets a good laugh. I honestly can't believe BassPro is carrying them.  Now, I'm kinda sorry I told everyone here I actually bought, and tried,  them. Can I still use this board, or do I have to go on probation, or through a committee of some kind?"
233288,Rich,2008-07-27 13:00:00,3927,"Bigcreekday, I confess to the same thing. I actually caught some fish on them. Just as much as I would on a fluke, trick worm or senko though."
