232429,Pachone,2008-07-24 22:26:00,276,"Ok, so Im not the best at posting these reports, and im trying to do them more often... so heres a start...  here are some pictures of the fishing ive been doing lately:  WAY BACK in MAY, the last week of it to be specific... I camped out in Algonquin Park... Didnt catch any lakers (im a newb, but getting better) but i did catch this bad boy, weighing in at 5.5 lbs, 31 inches.   I know its a lil big to eat... but my 3 buddies were starving for some Pike and they decided to harvest it... its my PB pike though, and put up a killer fight.  NEXT.. Went out walking the good ol creeks in Coburg and caught a couple lil brookies, rainbows and atlantics... heres a tiny but spotty brookie :   NOW ON TO THE BASS!!!!!  K SO i caught this bad boy on opener... 4lb Largie, mustve still been prego or just filled up on bait cuz its belly was BIG... unfortunately, my better picture got deleted, but heres a cool looking one :               OH and yea.. it was caught from SHORE!   Now I just went up to BOBS LAKE (i think) in lower frontenac, and had a killer time pitching and flipping lillies and docks this weekend. First time experience with SENKOS (yum dingers) and I had a BLAST!!!   Some big Rock Bass too  Some good top water too!    MAN, im pretty new to becoming a serious addict to fishing... but the more i go, the more i learn, the more i LOVE IT.  Cant wait til i get out there again...  Pachone"
