232946,markacosta,2008-07-26 02:28:00,2,"We'll be fishing for smallmouth/largemouth bass, walleye and pike, mainly on the wide part of the Magnetawan. What is most plentiful? What would you suggest chasing? This will be a first time for us.  Thinking of fishing White's Lake and Trout lake, also. What do you know about them?"
