233352,TJQ,2008-07-27 17:55:00,7806,"I'm doing some videos for the guys at Hammerhead Lures.  I have a question.. If you could see the lures action online before you buy, would it help with your purchasing descision... or do you simply go by how things look in the store when trying new baits??  Would videos like this help you try something new??  <object width=""425"" height=""349""><param name=""movie"" value="""
233354,Guest lundboy,2008-07-27 17:59:00,0,It would help me make a decision to buy and try.  But I would be more convinced if it had a strike some where in the vid clip.
233356,Greencoachdog,2008-07-27 18:07:00,8163,"I agree, if a hugh Jass fish had come out of nowhere and eaten that lure... I'd be buying a dozen of them right now!!!"
233358,Clampet,2008-07-27 18:15:00,1947,"I say yes, it would help to see the lure in action. It would show the difference between similar lure type/cost, if any. From a mktg perspective, I would suggest showing the lures being nailed by (hopefully) large gamefish."
233360,ChrisK,2008-07-27 18:25:00,2772,"TJ, Agree with the boys above... Although its a cool thing to see the action of the bait and just that would probably sway me to purchase such a bait,it sure would convince me even more if a fish took the bait during the clip....  Cheers !!"
233361,TJQ,2008-07-27 18:28:00,7806,Thanks guys... I will definaltley have some fish hitting those lures!!
233365,forrest,2008-07-27 18:42:00,1032,"continuous stream of thought:  -Having a fish hit the lure will not make people say ""I am going to buy that lure for sure!"" it will just keep people from thinking ""this company can't get a fish to bite their lure if they tried!""  -What good is seeing a lure from the front, or even the side?  People see their lures mostly from the top so seeing that lure wiggle int he water does nothing for me. -Thousand of lures wiggle, whats great about this wiggle? -What speed is the lure going?  Walleye speed? Musky speed? slow retrieve speed?"
233368,Wild,2008-07-27 19:10:00,704,"Yes the visual appeal is great when accompanied buy quicker changes in scenery and speed, color vid would be the way to go of course. Either way the video is much more appealing than all pro fisherman endorsements slapped on anything that floats or sinks."
233372,Leecher,2008-07-27 19:29:00,7832,"Yes it would definitely make an impact on my decision.....Having said that....too bad you did not get a strike on this one cause the structure that the lure travelled in the vid, especially at the biggining,  sure was walley country out there.  Leechman"
233381,BFSC Kevin,2008-07-27 20:13:00,1351,"to avoid the problem of, ""oh your lure didn't get a strike!"".. you can just have it run in a tank/pool"
233385,MrMike,2008-07-27 20:24:00,153,"I think more lures get sold by word of mouth, than any video, I would much rather have a friend tell me they used it and had success than a video"
