232653,cranks bait,2008-07-25 12:26:00,721," My cranking battery is brand new (2 months) as I got it with my new motor.  It's down to a 9.9 volt reading on it, until I put the juice to the motor and then it goes up to 13.8.  As for the deep cycle I will be checking into the warrenty.  It's only 2 cells that are bubbling over.  I am using the same charger and charging the same way I always do."
232901,Thomas13,2008-07-26 01:05:00,6, A fully charged battery has a voltage of 12.65 and is 100% discharged at 11.89 so if your starting voltage before the juice is 9.9 you obviously have an issue. You usually see a voltage that low if the battery has been sitting a looong time without a charge. Try charging it with an external charger 5 amps for 20 hours and then retest the voltage.
232130,Thomas13,2008-07-24 11:53:00,6,"Hey everyone,  Here's some info on batteries to help you with your decisions.  Delco (Delphi) no longer makes batteries as Delphi was sold several years ago. Delco now uses several different manufactures including KSB (Korean Storage Battery) so it's not the same battery that you bought 10 years ago.  Walmart and Costco both sell JCI (Johnson Controls) batteries and a lot of their product is made in Mexico.  Iterstate also sells JCI.  Exide bought GNB several years ago so GNB marine batteries are no longer available.  Crown Battery is a small manufacture in Fremont and to my knowledge they don't make a full line of batteries to cover all applications, the last I heard they were bringing in batteries from Brazil.  For a cranking battery (starting application) you wouldn't need a gel unless you were concerned about leaking but there are better alternatives than gel batteries for those applications.  Battery group size is simply an easy way to identify a battery in terms of its physical size. ie. group 27 batteries are the same size regardless if they are a starting or deep cycle battery.  Dual purpose batteries would not be my choice for a deep cycle application;Sure they a less expensive but they also have less reserve capacity and tend to not last as long over their life time.  Hope this helps!"
232135,cranks bait,2008-07-24 12:02:00,721,"  Thank you for that info.  I was going to start another thread today about this.  I have my sump pump, lights, wells and fish finder on the cranking battery.  I notice that it is way down in it's capacity, even though my motor should be charging it.   I never run the finder and lights without the engine running because I do not want to drain the batery.  As for a deep cell battery, I have a Deka (I think that's what it is) with a 200 reserve.  I got it last spring.  Have noticed that it is not holding it's charge very well anymore.  I have added some distilled water and it seems to be better.  But now it bubbles over and makes odd noises."
232158,Seaweed,2008-07-24 13:06:00,135,I can't say enough good things about Deka deep cycle batteries.  Take that one you are having trouble with back and they will swap it for new.  Best battery bar none out there for life cycle.  I run a 24 volt system with a Motorguide 67 Brute with two Deka 31 batteries in my Nitro.  I take it to Nippissing every year.  It runs all week without charge.  Now I'm not tournament fishing by any means during that week but I was floored the first time I got the whole week out of the batteries.... I couldn't believe it but it happened and has year after year.  When I fish tournaments I charge every day but I bet I could get two days out of them easily.  Just my 2 cents worth.
232313,Thomas13,2008-07-24 19:21:00,6," What do you mean by ""it's way down in it's capacity""? There are several factors that impact a starting batteries performance including it's age and it's state of charge (voltage). If you are discharging your starting battery more tahn 10% on a regular basis your batteries life is going to be greatly shortened. If all the cells are bubbling it's a sign of possible overcharging. If only 1 cell is bubbling than the battery likely has a dead cell or is on it's way to developing a dead cell and should be covered under warranty. You may want to pick yourself up a hydrometer at Crappy Tire and measure the specific gravity of the electrolyte in each cell. If the variation between the highest and lowest cell reading is 50 gravity points or more you probably have a failing cell. (The battery should be at least 12.45 volts before testing with a hydrometer.) Hope that helps."
