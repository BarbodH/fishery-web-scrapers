233451,danc,2008-07-27 23:46:00,4677,This thread is getting out of hand. Speed kills. I know that for a fact. You wouldn't want to go through what I did because of speed racing. I apologize for making this a personal issue. This thread is now locked.
233434,blarg,2008-07-27 23:20:00,289,"There about a billion different ways that people get hurt, and another billion people doing other stupid things that might get other people hurt.  Is this illegal?, yes, is it dangerous? yes.  Is that any different from alot of other things, no.  Should you do this on  busy street? of course not.  But i'd bet more people are killed on the streets in ""accidents"" at the speed limit than the odd guy who puts the pedal down on a quiet highway once in a while.  If you really want safety id start with removing about half the liscensed drivers who would never speed first, because following the rules doesn't really mean that you actually know how to drive now does it.  It just makes you legally unsafe."

233441,fishing n autograph,2008-07-27 23:30:00,2540,wow.....where do you guys do this....i need some tickets lol......   Be careful......i've seen what 200kph looks like when it rear ends a car going 60......no cool
233231,MoriaRiverMan,2008-07-27 01:36:00,314,This is worse than a fish story topic........   1 out of 10 stories are true!  I drag raced for years and would love to see a everyday driver hold onto a car at some of the speeds being claimed !!!!!  Let alone if you check the motor trend top speeds for cars being posted!!!!!    there way under........hmmmm
233233,wallyboss,2008-07-27 01:53:00,1095,??? I buried a hook(Not a needle) in a fish's gullet and I kept it!!   1 over my limit  That was 15 years ago.  Is that more illegal than exceeding a speed limit??
233239,Cudz,2008-07-27 02:13:00,2652,"Now I am not saying he did or he didn't but you should never doubt.  I know a guy with a renegade that runs 12 seconds flat in a 1/4 mile and he does it on 33"" tires and a 4"" lift I believe (he used to run 12.7 on 37"").  My grand cherokee had a 5.9 with a bunch of engine work include complete ecu swap and I ran 100 shot of nitrous.  Nothing could touch that vehicle on the street in an 1/8 mile race.  My friends lightning that was putting down about 500hp at the wheel would only just beat me at the finish line in 1/4 mile.  I have learned not to doubt some times.  i know of another 5.9 grand cherokee taht runs 10.8 at 124 mph in the 1/4 mile.  Don't underestimate the jeep especially a 5.9.  They look like any other grand cherokee only they are special  I used to have a vid of the renegade but now only pics http://www.jeepfan.com/readersjeeps/fuzz401.php  This is like my 5.9 only it has a few more mods.    This guy now can run 10.8 now.   this is one of my fave vids    Don't doubt what people say.  Sometimes they tell the truth"
233241,MoriaRiverMan,2008-07-27 02:21:00,314,True.........but im guessing this claim is a stocker
