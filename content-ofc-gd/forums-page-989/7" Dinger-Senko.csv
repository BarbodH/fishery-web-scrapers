233384,MrMike,2008-07-27 20:22:00,153,You will get less bites but bigger average fish

233491,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-28 01:01:00,2585,i think any size fish will hit them but in most cases it will be bigger fish.  I use the smaller 4 or 5 inch and do very well with all sizes.  If i was hunting the biggest bass on the lake i would surely use them or bigger but that may mean only a few hits a day  cheers!
