231880,canadianboy,2008-07-23 23:21:00,83,im going to go get some gulp alive before the weekend you know the bucket for 20 bucks and was wondering what people thought were better. i know theres a post similar to this but know we can all vote vote and decide the real winner.  cheers
231885,Leecher,2008-07-23 23:33:00,7832,"I like the minnow because was successfull with them catching eyes.  The action is just the same as plastic twister tails.  If you read the other thread, there was a mention of the bucket leaking and also a link so you can send feedback on this product and yesterday, did that...... this was the response I got from them today:     If you buy one and it leaks, please send an email.  Leechman"
231888,canadianboy,2008-07-23 23:37:00,83,i definatly will shoot you an email because im for sure buying some before the weekend just not sure between leaches or minnows but becuase who caught eyes on the minnows(my fav. fish) i think im going to get those but i will wait and see a little bit longer for more feedback. hopefully the gulp will be a lot better quality then the bucket. how big were the eyes you were getting with the minnows.  thanks  canadianboy
231889,fishindevil,2008-07-23 23:38:00,6254,"Glad to hear they took care of you and that they are offering a replacement !! it shows at least they care about their customers...cheers to pure fishing !!!!  Oh and by the way,i prefer to fish for walleyes with the gulp 3""minnow but at certain times they will hit a gulp3""leech as well,so they both are great in my books and i use them quite frequently !!!!"
231896,Leecher,2008-07-23 23:53:00,7832," They were in the 18"" - 19"" range.....here is a pic that I posted not to long ago    OOOh!! I forgot to mention, who ever put that link in the other thread.... cant remember the name.....Thank you.  FD    Will certaintly give leeches a try.... just did not get the chance to use them.   Thanks a bunch Leechman"
231901,brickNblock,2008-07-23 23:58:00,598,WTG Leechman.... I have both the leeches and minnows and they both were leaking....made my boat smell like crap. That was exellent info to have bud and for that I thankyou.  As for the original post...... I think the entire THING was a scam....a sales/marketing scam to the extreme. My wife swears by them as her confidence bait so Im with it for the time being....BUT.. I'd never buy another bucket...Never. Leak or not......the real thing is the real deal and a darnsight more affordable.. Gulp makes some great products but I think you;'d be further ahead getting the regular gulp rather then the gulpAlive.....SAVE A FEW BUCKS AS WELL. ....if money isnt an issue ..try it out. I believe its a waste of money. My.......$0.02
231905,canadianboy,2008-07-24 00:05:00,83,thanks i got some normal gulp to so il compare and maybe write up a report with hopefully some pics of fish
232042,Angler16,2008-07-24 02:43:00,188,DO NOT BUY THE BUCKET BUY THE GULP PACK OF MINNOWS AND GULP PACK OF LEECHES LESS EXPENSIVE AND YOU GET A TASTE OF BOTH!good luck -Little Angler
232666,spooner_jr,2008-07-25 13:10:00,193,"I don't remove the entire safety seal under the lid.  I cut it around the inside of the pail and leave the strip on top of the pail to act as a gasket, haven't had any leaks so far."
232975,Cudz,2008-07-26 03:25:00,2652,Now that is a good call.  Having said that I only peel back the safety seal halfway and it is always still on and mine leaks.
233026,Garry2Rs,2008-07-26 12:42:00,1425,My pail doesn't leak...maybe my hands are stronger.
233027,cranks bait,2008-07-26 12:51:00,721,"I've never used the stuff, but my wife wants too.  She thinks it's ""cute"", and that's what catches fish.  As for the seal.  A buddy of mine has gone through several pails of the stuff already.  His tip is to not pulloff the seal, but cut a cross in the middle to be able to get at the stuff but not leak.  It was bouncing all over the boat on a trip, upside down and all, no leaks.  The only slime was from the pike!!!"
233050,MrMike,2008-07-26 13:45:00,153,both will catch alot of fish
233221,Cudz,2008-07-27 01:19:00,2652,LOL.  You must be single.

233366,bassmaster4,2008-07-27 18:57:00,801,i liek the leech better as i have caught more fish on the leech than the minnow but i find the minnows to be more durable than the leeches
