232765,Jen,2008-07-25 18:22:00,833,"It has been a while since I have done a post… However I have been doing a great deal of fishing. The month of July included a family fishing trip with my Sister and her family, a weekend away with our friends  on Lake Ontario, a trip to Cleveland to try for some American Walleye and perch on Lake Erie, as well as several trips out on Lake Erie off of Port Maitland in search of perch, bass and walleye. I have included some pictures. Trip on Lake Ontario With My Sister and her Family!      Weekend  at Port Weller with Brandon and Sarah      Weekend in Ohio on Erie off the shores of Cleveland One Small Perch, but we tried hard!    Lake Erie this past week     Walleye were being caught in 60-70 feet of water West of Port Maitland on Jets,  300 feet back running worm harnesses in chartrues, purple and black and willow leaf golds. The salmon were  caught on riggers in 200 feet of water  and on dipsy's 2 setting  125 back  with long leads.  Michigan Stingers, Moon Glows,  Flys and Flashers were what worked for us. On most days the weather was un co operative, starting out bright and sunny and turning into gusty winds or rain storms.  This month has been extreamly unpredictable  weather wise yet we managed to preserver and enjoy every moment. Thanks to Fishmaster, Steve C., Lynette, Ed, Logan, Jr, Sarah, Brandon and my mom for joining us on our many adventures… the month was amazing when it came to spending time with some really wonderful people . The great fishing was the added bonus… Cheers Jen"
