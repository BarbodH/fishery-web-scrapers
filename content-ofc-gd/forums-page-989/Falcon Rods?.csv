231775,ultraman18,2008-07-23 20:17:00,4,I live around the GTA and was wondering where I can go buy Falcon rods? More specifically the Falcon Cara T7 series casting rods. I was at Bass Pro today and was surprised they didn't have them.  Thanks.
231824,mbac31,2008-07-23 21:35:00,904,I'm not so sure they sell them here. I knoe fishing world sells some of their tackle storage stuff. I'm not to sure on the rods though. PM blake and he can tell you. I have bought mine from Cabelas and Takle warehouse. I have all their tackle storage products. They have an organizing system that is by far the best out there. The rods are very well made as well.
231951,BabyHerc,2008-07-24 01:19:00,285,I've checked every tackle shop within two hours of Toronto a couple of years ago for Falcon rods.  No one's got 'em.

232871,danbo,2008-07-25 23:16:00,2646,What do they do that Fenwick can't?
232879,mbac31,2008-07-25 23:50:00,904,Different Strokes for different folks I guess. Like me I have a ton of different Manufactuers and love to try them all. These rods are a little than the compareable Techna Av or Elite Tech. I have bought the Elite Tech and have sold them allready. Fenwick made a mistake in making them. Techna rods are much better. If you are lookin I have a brand new Techna Av casting 7'mhf for sale. Never used still has plastic wrap on it. I beleive I have 2 of them actually in my fishing room somewhere. PM me and I will give you a price.
232886,danbo,2008-07-26 00:08:00,2646,"Thanx bro, but I need a meatstick for chucking 1oz spinnerbaits."
232892,mbac31,2008-07-26 00:43:00,904,"It was meant for ultraman18. The rod is comparab le to what he wants. 1oz spinnerbaits. Try a G loomis or a Dobyns for your spinnerbaits. I have them that handle up to 8 oz for my swimbaits. Great rods. Try a Dobyns Champ Cast Rod 7'3"" Med Hvy XF 735C. The Fenwick rod I have , it covers up to 1 1/2 oz actually. The same tip action as a G loomis spinnerbait rod. I have both."

232896,mbac31,2008-07-26 00:54:00,904,"These guys are great. I buy from there all the time. Infact I just bought some of their Under Armour thats on sale. The rods however will cost you from there. They will only ship fed ex, charges by the time a rod gets to Canada are usually 60-70 bucks more. Buy from a site like BBC, Tackletour,  or here as you will pay actuall shipping with insurance no more that 25 bucks US tops."
232899,danbo,2008-07-26 01:02:00,2646,Thanx for the info!
233000,ultraman18,2008-07-26 07:38:00,4,"thanks for the tips i guess i'll wait a bit until the new falcons are out in the fall from what i read on the coverage at icast, they're doing away with the foregrip, and are made with an even lighter material just wanted to go try one out at a local store around toronto first and see. i might not like it, who knows  but i was looking for a beginner all purpose baitcasting rod the CC-5-166MH-T7 (all around rod) and the CC-5-167MH-T7 (weightless worm) to be exact  and as for fenwick, i've tried the ones that are comparable in price and they're a bit too heavy for my liking i'm a st croix guy and have a couple of the legend tournament spinning rods and i'm just trying to start out in baitcasting  thanks for the replies guys appreciate it"
