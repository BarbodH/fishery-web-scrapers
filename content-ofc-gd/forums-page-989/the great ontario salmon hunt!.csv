230800,MuddyWater,2008-07-21 20:46:00,218,i know its way to early but when the time comes could i enter some fish?
230802,misfish,2008-07-21 20:48:00,29133,Sorry miss read yer report. Sure you can.
230834,bucktail,2008-07-21 22:36:00,1857,"Yep.  Sometimes you can get fish as Early as August if you get a really hard westerly or North westerly blow.This pushes the warm water offshore and allows the colder deep water to upwell next to shore.  Kings and Browns will sometimes slide into the only available ""warmer"" water which will be the river mouth. They will be very light sensitize and move offshore as the sun rises.  Once lost 4 20 lb Kings on crankbaits in easly August off the Bronte pier many years ago.  You really dont stand much of a chance when theyu are chrome silver!!!!!  But sooooooo much fun!"

232729,sully,2008-07-25 16:53:00,40,Some guy caught the record brown throwing hardware from shore. out in oshawa or east somewhere.... he didn't have a ticket and would have won.... was a few years ago though!
232736,MuddyWater,2008-07-25 17:04:00,218,i catch lots of them off the peirs so i was just wondering thanks guys
