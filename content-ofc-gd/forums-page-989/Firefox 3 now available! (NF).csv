217600,JFR,2008-06-20 16:22:00,498,"Well, I downloaded and activated the new Firefox and I am very impressed.  I am currently subscribing to Rogers Ultralite internet service.  This FF makes the ultra lite seem very fast.  I'm going to stick with it, and start learning the add ons.  Thanks for sharing Rick  Just JOHN"
217609,ufish2,2008-06-20 17:29:00,15,"Hey everybody!!!  Thanks for the info on Firefox! I have a question for the experts here, I have Mozilla firefox at home and at work, does anyone know how i can transfer my bookmarks from my work computer to my home computer.  I love Firefox it works so well and is very stable.  Any help would be great"
217615,Guest lundboy,2008-06-20 17:55:00,0, This is for Firefox 3 now (Since I upgraded)  but it's similar in FF2 Goto Bookmarks->Organize Bookmarks -> Import and Backup -> Export  This will create an HTML file which you can then use the same process to IMPORT into the other Firefox browser.
218031,Canuck2fan,2008-06-22 16:30:00,1444,I installed it and just don't get the hype.... Same speed as my IE loading pages with about 5 different pages being times with no cache. Then it took me about a half hour of tweaking to find out that I just couldn't get it look the way I wanted it. I like having enlarged text so I don't have to go blind reading posts LOL. I eventually got the text the right size but by that time the width of window meant I had to scroll over all the time. The tab feature is good but I just tend to open 5 or 6 windows with IE and am used to that.  I think I will stay with IE 6.0 until I have to upgrade that then see what FF is like then.

232640,Tdel,2008-07-25 11:30:00,393,"Musky Mike, they were actually extensions that weren't compatible with Fire Fox 3.  Tiny Url Creator was one of them and Avg Security Toolbar/ Avg Search.  Clipmarks was another one that wasn't compatible. Right now the only one's that are still not compatible is Avg Security toolbar & Avg Search.  The others have been update since my last post on this subject.  I decided to stay with Fire Fox 3 and not go back to 2.  Wild, I like ADP too.  Tom"
216697,bigfish1965,2008-06-18 02:02:00,3382,I've downloaded the new Firefox 3..all I can say is wow..it is fast. I haven't' tweaked a damn thing yet either. So many new features...it's like porn for geeks. Not really.
216701,Rich,2008-06-18 02:09:00,3927,"Well, that is much faster. Thanks for the tip!"
216715,tibbs,2008-06-18 03:06:00,650,Wow!  It's even faster then before!  Thanks!
216724,DanTheMan,2008-06-18 03:18:00,257,Working great bud!!!  Thanks!!
216725,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-18 03:20:00,2585,wow it is fast
216732,tibbs,2008-06-18 03:29:00,650,Here's the link...  Firefox 3
216745,mikeymikey,2008-06-18 06:17:00,376,"yes it is somewhat faster and it is my favorite web browser.  but if you want faster browser,, you gotta use Opera."
216746,danbo,2008-06-18 07:56:00,2646,Thanx Rick
216767,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-18 12:28:00,3761,Thanks. Works good with my new laptop.
216783,setomonkey,2008-06-18 13:14:00,872,"Thanks for the tip, downloading it now...  Odd that I didn't get a notice about it in Firefox...  Mike"
216797,JohnF,2008-06-18 13:50:00,3494,"Wow! I hadn't bothered with it since I tried it on an old XP machine a few years back. This version makes Explorer look like the proverbial turtle. I've got it loaded now on my new Vista machine and I'm impressed, very impressed.  Thanks Rick  JF"
216841,bigfish1965,2008-06-18 16:01:00,3382,"You won't get a notice because it s a new version number, not an update."
216900,Zubris21,2008-06-18 18:01:00,563,Incredibly fast!  Thanks!
216977,JFR,2008-06-18 20:38:00,498,"Not being a computer geek  Can it be explained to me why this is better than the current IE that is on my machine?  If I install or download this new version, what will it do to my current applications etc.  Thanks  John"
216978,JohnF,2008-06-18 20:44:00,3494," I'm not a geek either but I can tell you that my machine now runs like it's got a rocket up it's butt (on the internet), at least compared to the way it ran outa the box on IE. I'm impressed, seriously. It doesn't change your other apps like IE. You can choose whether you want it to be the default browser. Try it. I'll bet you'll like it too. This machine is only a few months old with pretty good RAM etc and is running on Vista. I even screwed up and activated the Norton freeby that came with it and this browser doesn't seem to be slowed down by it. IE sure was boggy.  I've used Firefox before, several machines, but never experienced the results this one gives.  JF"
216988,taper,2008-06-18 21:33:00,611,"Just to add with Firefox you will have a lot less trouble with viruses etc. than you will with IE. Try Firefox and Thunderbird, both are from Mozilla. I switched on Ricks recommendation 3 or 4 years ago and could not imagine using IE any more."
216995,paul_614,2008-06-18 21:46:00,168,Will I lose my bookmarks like I have in the past with updates?
216996,JFR,2008-06-18 21:47:00,498,Thank you for the quick response.  I just downloaded the program. I'll see where it takes me.  Just JOHN
216997,JohnF,2008-06-18 21:53:00,3494, Nope. It asks if you wanna import 'em.  JF
217045,pigeonfisher,2008-06-19 00:52:00,696,"Isn't porn for geeks, porn?  If not, it must be rough being a geek!  hahahaha"
217108,ccmtcanada,2008-06-19 02:42:00,7971,Thanks Rick....have it running here at home....and it's FAST!!! WOOHOO!!!!
217119,muskymike,2008-06-19 03:08:00,772," Hey John, there are so many reasons why it is a lot better then IE. the Pop up blocker is much better, the anti phishing is more thorough, literally thousands of add-ons that let you customize the look and feel of it. Once Ver 3.0+ comes out you will see a lot more extensions come about. Tabbed browsing is a lot easier and more customizable, and it doesnt have the errors that IE does (it doenst crash consistently)  Try the add-on's go FireFox Add-ons  You will definitely like it, just give it a chance, you will not want to go back to IE once you start using it.  I hope this helps"
217182,Tdel,2008-06-19 13:17:00,393,Version 3 is nice and fast.  Only problem I have is that all but one of my add-on's are not compatible with version 3.0.  Don't know if I am going to keep 3 or go back to 2.  Tom
217183,muskymike,2008-06-19 13:21:00,772," Hey Tom, about 98% of Add-ons are compatible. You probably just need to go to the developers website.  What add on is it? I know this was the case for Minimize to tray."
217227,Canuck2fan,2008-06-19 15:15:00,1444,"Wow I am ever in the minority here. I tried all the FF's before and they all quite frankly weren't any good. Sure they had lots of bells and whistles but I like my IE 6.0 it is fast stable and I never have any hassles or viruses. The earlier FF's were slow and ungainly to me.... But then again I spent a lot of time setting IE up to do what I want and haven't made the mistake of going up to 7.0 with Xp because it is just a nightmare, because it was really designed to work with vista."
