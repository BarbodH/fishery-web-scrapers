I'm planning to take my son camping (on crown land not in a park) and bass fishing for a couple of days. My son stated that the lake can't have alot of boat traffic. I was thinking of the following lakes and I was wondering what lakes you would recommend: 1. Weslemkoon lake. 2. Deerock Lake 3. Skootamaatta   Thanks for your help  Popr"

Skoot....... good multi species lake....might be your best bet if one species is off.  Can I come!!  post a good report when you get back."
