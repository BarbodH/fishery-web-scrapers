232427,JohnF,2008-07-24 22:24:00,3494,"I'm off to visit relatives who've rented something in Collingwood next week. I'll have my gear with me, including waders, just in case anyone's looking for the company of a doddering old fool for a day or part day of fishing. I've got some tentative plans with one member here, but those may go up in smoke depending on a certain about to be born babe. Even if the baby decides to be considerate and wait a while, which will make the dear little thing totally different than my own kids, I'll still have some other time to play as long as it's close to Collingwood. I hear there's some river fishing just west of the town but don't have any details. As I've said often enuf here, I'm open to new experiences of the fishing kind.  My wife and our cousins are happy to lay beside the pool all day every day but I get restless. We do that pool thang for four weeks every winter in Mexico. They won't even miss me here at home in Ontario.  JF"
232437,misfish,2008-07-24 22:34:00,29133,"Why couldnt you be up there this weekend? Elvis is here,he LIVES in Collingwood didnt you know."
232465,JohnF,2008-07-24 23:02:00,3494, Ummm - that's why we waited till next week. Didn't wanna be tripping over Elvis clones all the time. I didn't particularly like Elvis when he was alive. I can sure do without him now.  JF
232479,misfish,2008-07-24 23:16:00,29133,"Here I thought you were a friend. I think he and Bruce Lee and Dale Earnhart SR, are hiding out to save the world. Enjoy yer stay no matter .

232488,Musky or Specks,2008-07-24 23:36:00,2710,John why not go do some flyfishing on the Upper Beaver around Feversham. Or the Rocky Saugeen around Traverston.
232490,JohnF,2008-07-24 23:39:00,3494, Are the access points easy to locate? I'm happy fishing alone too. I just talk to myself more.  JF
232492,ketchenany,2008-07-24 23:40:00,3229,Or hit the Bighead! is an amazing river

232545,Greencoachdog,2008-07-25 01:22:00,8163,"Fly fishing, Bighead, and Upper Beaver!!! sounds XXX"
232546,JohnF,2008-07-25 01:24:00,3494," Sounds like fun, huh?  JF"
232549,Greencoachdog,2008-07-25 01:28:00,8163, The most fun you can have without laffin'!!!
232550,JohnF,2008-07-25 01:29:00,3494, I sometimes giggle.  JF
232552,Greencoachdog,2008-07-25 01:34:00,8163,  It's just kinky when you use a feather John...         ... it's perverted when you use the whole chicken!
232555,Musky or Specks,2008-07-25 01:41:00,2710,Access is okay you can just park on the South side of the bridge at Feversham and walk down into the gorge on the upstream side of the bridge. On the Rocky go one bridge downstream of Traverston. And the downstream part of that stretch is not posted. There are no big fish to be had but they are very willing and forgiving of beginner flyfisherman such as yourself. I recommend yu bring a handful of elk hair caddis size 14 & 16
232561,JohnF,2008-07-25 01:54:00,3494," Thank you, Duly noted.  JF"

232609,Musky or Specks,2008-07-25 04:50:00,2710,"Umm Its July, fish dont start showing up till mid august at the earliest."
