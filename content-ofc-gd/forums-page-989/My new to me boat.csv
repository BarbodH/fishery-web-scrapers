232364,nancur373,2008-07-24 21:09:00,1211,I got the plate for the trailer. I need to go to Service Canada to get the license.
232403,bassmastermike,2008-07-24 21:51:00,295,I have a 70 HP that would fit nice on that !!
232418,nancur373,2008-07-24 22:06:00,1211,Bit too much
232633,modny,2008-07-25 11:05:00,502, obvy he was joking..  but i do have a 20 merc...
232661,nancur373,2008-07-25 12:57:00,1211,My 9.9 will do for now. I have to spend my spare money in the boat.
232667,Gerritt,2008-07-25 13:14:00,6129,"Congrats on the new boat! A bit of work and she will be a fine looking vessel for sure!  First thing I would inspect and take care of would be that transom it looks iffy looking @ the pictures... Any soft spots?.. replace the Ply with some strong marine grade. I have some 1"" stuff here that should do the trick for you, it is yours if you would like it.. it should be enough to do the job. I also have some left over aluminum.. not sure how many lengths of tube and angle I have left but they are yours for a case of beer  if you need any advice feel free to drop me a line.  G"
232670,The Urban Fisherman,2008-07-25 13:18:00,2050,"awesome dude!  Congrats on the boat.  If you've got time for the ""pimpin"" this year go for it, but if it were me I'd just get it sea-worthy and get some fishing in this season and save pimpin' it up for the off-season.  That's what I did with my little tooner and I ended up with a much better finished product.  Doing it in the winter allows you to take your time and do it right, exactly how you really want it.  In the summer you're to anxious to get out fishing on weekends so you might be tempted to rush things - cutting corners etc. etc.  either way - congrats, and good luck!  Cheers, UF"
232681,modny,2008-07-25 13:38:00,502,paint the boat gold and purple with leopard pring seats and call it PIMP FISHINg or PIMPIN AND FISHIN  and get spinner hubcaps for the trailer  haha
232730,Garyv,2008-07-25 16:55:00,547,It has the ability to catch as many fish as a ranger bass boat...only it will take longer to get where your going.  If your not tournament fishing who cares about time!
232842,addict,2008-07-25 21:24:00,475,a little time and work and that thing could be one sweet little fishin machine.
232845,JohnF,2008-07-25 21:40:00,3494, And you'll have a lot more money left at the end of the day.  JF
231850,nancur373,2008-07-23 22:30:00,1211,"Picked her up on Sunday. Had to drive a couple hours to Pigeon Lake to get her. She's old, rough, tired, but she floats. Just needs a little lovin.        "
231852,Terry,2008-07-23 22:36:00,14456,"beauty is in the eye  of the beholder...      and if it will server your needs, then she is beautiful    or put a bag over her face and go for it"
231857,bucktail,2008-07-23 22:39:00,1857,Good project.....In ten years you will be looking back on her amazed at how many fish came over the side!
231859,Roy,2008-07-23 22:41:00,13728,Good project boat for ya bud. Get her looking good and she'll serve you well. Have a great time!
231872,nancur373,2008-07-23 23:06:00,1211,She serves the purpose and budget for now.
231875,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-23 23:10:00,0,Congrats on the new boat.It looks shaky but it definitely has potential.
231878,modny,2008-07-23 23:14:00,502,"nice tinny,  i'd gut that whole thing and rebuild it. good base to work with"
231898,Smokey,2008-07-23 23:54:00,1278,"Good Luck with it, should be a beauty with a little bit of TLC."
231919,steve barrett,2008-07-24 00:29:00,142,
231938,pigeonfisher,2008-07-24 00:55:00,696,I know of a good 20hp Johnson that would tuck onto the back of that thing.  If ya need a motor shoot me an message thing.
231942,Tarzan's Jane,2008-07-24 00:58:00,1183,"Congrats....talk to Gerritt, he knows all about making her look purdy!"
231966,nancur373,2008-07-24 01:39:00,1211,"I measured her from stem to stern around the gunwhale and it measured 15' 4"""
231980,cpguy29,2008-07-24 01:58:00,148,She'll be good for exploring all those secluded back lakes. You towing it with the Honda?
231985,nancur373,2008-07-24 02:02:00,1211,No. The Santa Fe.
231987,boatman,2008-07-24 02:03:00,350,That's a quality boat under there. Very heavy and sturdy. Thornes are a nice vessel. Undo what the previous owner did and you will have a great utility to work with. What's the max hp rating?
231992,nancur373,2008-07-24 02:07:00,1211,No Idea
231998,Rich,2008-07-24 02:13:00,3927,Nice. You'll have to give us updates on the project as you go!
232008,boatman,2008-07-24 02:18:00,350," There should be a capacity plate somewhere near the stern. You are legally required to have one so you should get one. What hp was on it prior to your getting it? Obviously 10 hp or greater. I'd guess upto 25 hp. Do you have the license for it? Otherwise, you have to get that too. The cops have checked me twice in the last two years. You can find all the info you need about licensing at the Service Canada website."
232045,nancur373,2008-07-24 02:47:00,1211,Don't have the boaters card yet. But I'm running a 9.9 for now. It has a plywood transom and to tell you the truth I haven't lookd hard for the plate.
232048,e-z-out,2008-07-24 02:53:00,1052,Congrats CURT she looks good better then the boat we used last time i bet she wont get wet like the other time we went out lol
232056,nancur373,2008-07-24 03:02:00,1211,Thinking about taking her to Belwood for the maiden. Should be a little better. May even be able to stand up to pee this time...LOL
232057,e-z-out,2008-07-24 03:05:00,1052,  Damn that takes me back to that trip lol If i didn't hold onto that tree we so would have been in the lake lol. I need to pick my boat up from the cottage soon and take you out on it. So far my dad has put more hours on it then me.
232091,ehg,2008-07-24 05:29:00,2666,"That boat should be pretty good once cleaned up. It's a Thornes aluminum,  they are great for cutting through the water and waves for their size. Had a 1961 12ft. Thornes that lasted me 27 yrs. before it leaked too much.(same boat in pics by Cudz) If its a 15 fter you should be good for 25 hp for max. rating. Enjoy. ehg"
232100,Greencoachdog,2008-07-24 09:01:00,8163, I'd say that's a two bagger Terry... put one on your head in case hers falls off. She's definately seen better days and needs some work.
232122,Victor,2008-07-24 11:30:00,1609,"nice boat nancur373. I just bought my ""new to me"" boat 2 months ago so I TOTALLY know how you feel right now . IT""S JUST AMAZING. I bet you can't wait to take her out.  When I first started out looking for a boat, I didn't care how it will look, I just simply needed something that floats and functional so I can be out on the lake to fish. I've been following your threads when you bought the motor and then the boat, that's a great deal. Ya it can defintely be pimped up but it will still do the job.  now get out there and lets see a report! If you need any help with the boat/trailer registration & pleasure craft licensing, let me know, I just did all of that for my boat."
