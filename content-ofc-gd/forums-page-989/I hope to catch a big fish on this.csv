232741,keram,2008-07-25 17:31:00,585,"After playing little bit with my woodworking tools I've decided to make some ""new"" baits. Bathtub and swimming pool test were very satisfactory.. These just need final clear coat.  Few more in different stages of ""developement""     "
232745,Black_Blade,2008-07-25 17:42:00,258,Awesome looking lures!  Look forward to hearing how they work!
232754,Reef Runner,2008-07-25 18:04:00,980,Awsome handywork there Keram!  Hope they catch you a biggun
232758,Greencoachdog,2008-07-25 18:14:00,8163,Excellent work Keram!!!  The bottom 2 look like they could double as duck and goose calls too!  I'm positive you'll catch a nice fish on all of them!!!
232762,keram,2008-07-25 18:18:00,585,"  I'm not a hunter Glen, so I have no idea what you are talking about  . They are just oversized poppers."
232764,Greencoachdog,2008-07-25 18:21:00,8163, ... and darn good looking ones too!!!
232781,anders,2008-07-25 18:49:00,1168,Awsome looking lures.  Good job and good luck with them.  I have a feeling that they are going to be successful for you.
232786,blaque,2008-07-25 19:01:00,2419,"very neat, how do you get the scale pattern from the paint. Im thinking wrapping like egg sac netting around the body of the bait , spraying it lightly and removing the netting? Or window screen. Definitely interesting however you did it. The whole project, not just the paint schemes"
232796,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-25 19:11:00,3761,"Cool looking lures, best of luck."
232797,keram,2008-07-25 19:14:00,585,Any netting will do. The only thing you have to keep in mind is that the netting has to be tight to the body of the lure
232799,modny,2008-07-25 19:16:00,502,very nice  even the paint is nice  are u puttin skirts on the poppers?
232807,keram,2008-07-25 19:25:00,585,"Yes, I'm working on it.   No skirt - no popper"
232815,bpsbassman,2008-07-25 19:50:00,941,Awesome job. Good luck on the water.  Let us know how you make out.
