Beside the fact that he will spend most of the day on the road on his birthday I couldn't think of to many places I would want to head to on my birthday Not going to mentioned how old he is today   but I hope I get around like he does at that age. I guess if I keep hanging around him he'll get me on the path to healthy  Happy Birthday TG and hope you enjoy many more!  Cheers!
