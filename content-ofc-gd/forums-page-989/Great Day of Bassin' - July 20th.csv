230580,Rich,2008-07-21 14:13:00,3927,"Hit up a local lake yesterday to shoot some video and it turned out to be a great day of bassin'. No trophy fish but one just under 4, a couple 3's and several between 1 - 3 pounds. Only one real dink. Fish were mostly caught on senkos but as evening hit the buzzbait bite was hot. Only took a couple of still pics you'll have to wait for the video for the full experience! Oh yeah also hooked a beat up looking white sucker on a grub in the middle of nowhere.. lol!        "
230611,Leecher,2008-07-21 15:14:00,7832,Great job Rich.....Nice pair of buckets  Thanks for sharing Leechman
230614,The Urban Fisherman,2008-07-21 15:21:00,2050,"Nice haul Rich  Freakin' senko's...  I have a love hate relationship with them.  They work great but aren't exactly easy on the pocket book!  Can't wait to see the vid dude, UF"
230615,Reef Runner,2008-07-21 15:22:00,980,Some nice fish there Rich.  Thanks for posting
230616,Greencoachdog,2008-07-21 15:24:00,8163,"Nice report, pics and fish!!!  I like the Buglemouth Bass in the first pic!"
230624,limeyangler,2008-07-21 15:35:00,5204,Those are some nice bass Rich. Did that sucker put up much of a fight? I caught one by accident icefishing in March....it really went for it!!! Cant wait to see the video.   Thanks for posting.
230629,tbayboy,2008-07-21 15:54:00,1497,"Nice fish Rich, looking forward to the video."
230686,Rich,2008-07-21 17:48:00,3927," Ryan, I don't use the real senkos. I think I bought one pack once and found them to be garbage, they're destroyed after one fish and didn't work any better than my others. I use the BPS Stik-O's. Closest thing to a real senko and a lot easier on the bank account. Since I barely use them anyway one pack lasts me a season."
230693,The Urban Fisherman,2008-07-21 18:01:00,2050," sweet - I'll have to give them a try.  Senko's catch a wack of fish in DC cept lot's of dinks.... but hey...on a rough day, dinks are better than nothing.  Like I said, tried yum dinger's two weeks ago and didn't get bit once...."
230696,misfish,2008-07-21 18:05:00,29133,You be da bugle boy.LOL Nice buckets Rich. TFS
230705,Rich,2008-07-21 18:15:00,3927,Agreed on the Yum Dingers UF.. I never had much luck with them either. They sink too slowly IMO.
230706,bpsbassman,2008-07-21 18:15:00,941,Nice fish Rich.
230725,solopaddler,2008-07-21 18:53:00,8605,Nice buckets man! And I'm diggin' the new Amish look  .
