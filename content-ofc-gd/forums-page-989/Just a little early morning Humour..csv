Something he has been hinting for the last yr now.....lol...So a week ago sunday past had my boy's & some freinds over for a fire & barby at my place.   Sinns was playing his new guitar, on the back deck. He has been playing for over 30 yrs now and was in a band for 15 yrs back in the eighties and early nineties.  So i am hopeing he gets back into writeing and doing some recording again.  Anyway this time of year we have the birds outside, gotta love summer  & while Mr sinns was playing his new baby Our bare eyed cockatoo Rock decided he would join in with the party.  Here is the video.....  Nauti.  "
