232630,Roy,2008-07-25 10:51:00,13728,I hear ya Terry. For the last two weeks or so it's been slowing down for me between 5:30am and 6:10 or so. Haven't figured it out yet but we do have a lead. Something about marshmallows.....
232631,modny,2008-07-25 10:56:00,502,"Roy, you gotta switch back tosmall white marshmallows. give the small colored ones a break for awhile, they are getting tired. thats why its slowing down."
