232608,Jonaton,2008-07-25 04:35:00,72,Me and the family have rented a cottage for a week near Gooderham right on the Irondale river. I am not at all familiar with the area and was wondering if anyone could answer a question or two for me. Is it possible to get a boat through any of the river or would we be better off finding local lakes nearby to fish? What body of water does the river connect with? Also what species might I find on the river and perhas some of the nearby lakes?  Thanks in advance for any help at all Cheers Jonaton

You can travel down it with a canoe but I wouldn't advise using a boat as its very shallow in spots and full of timber. In gooderham there is Gooderham (pine) lake that has walleye bass and apparently the odd laker and just north of there is glamour lake which has lakers,bass and rainbows. If you have anymore questions feel free to ask. Cheers jeff"
