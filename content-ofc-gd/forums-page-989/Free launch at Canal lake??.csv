232302,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-24 18:54:00,0,"Well I have 6 days of fishin to do next week, and will get bored with just fishing Simcoe. I want to try other lakes. There is a small chance, since it is very close, I will try Canal lake. Is there a free launch?  I think there is LM bass, Smallies, Musky, Pike and Walleye. Also very weedy so am considering throwing around the jig and pig."
232321,danbo,2008-07-24 19:36:00,2646,"Further up the road to the causeway.,under the bridge on Mitchell Lake..then motor over thru the canal."
232324,Terry,2008-07-24 19:38:00,14456,I have  not been to it in a long time  but you go north on centennial  park road  to canal lake past centennial  park keep going past the causeway and just after it it should be on the right...hope it's still there
232328,danbo,2008-07-24 19:43:00,2646,That's true Terry but I hope he has a tilt-trailer..it's pretty shallow.
232358,keram,2008-07-24 20:58:00,585,"This is a launch I was useing for last three years, no problems. It is not free. There is ""courtesy box"" ( you will get a ticket for non payment ) for parking car & trailer - $ 6.00. As far as I know there is no ""free"" boat launch on this lake"
232368,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-24 21:20:00,0," That one I know. Thanks. Was looking for something on the left side of the lake. After the causeway on centennial park rd?? I guess this is on the north side of Canal lake? Thanks Terry, but how shallow are we talking?  Which one are you talking about Keram? The causeway one or the one on Mitchel?"
232382,keram,2008-07-24 21:33:00,585,"The causeway one. I always launch there ( it is practically in the middle of the lake.). Another bonus is that it is very close to   my my hot spots. Couple weeks ago I've seen 19' bass boat with 150 on the back launching without any problems BTW JB, I work on it."
232387,johnnyb,2008-07-24 21:37:00,3413,$6.00 = as good as free!
232389,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-24 21:37:00,0,Thanks. I know that pike are a plenty but how are the largies in that lake? Any big ones? And how about the pickerel? Are they rare or is there a good population?
232400,keram,2008-07-24 21:49:00,585,Search my reports JB. This is what you can expect
232416,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-24 22:05:00,0,Thanks. Haven't fished it for awhile. And only from shore. Last time I was there I nailed a 36 incher but really skinny. Around 6lbs.... Maybe I will give it a try....
232635,Zamboni,2008-07-25 11:12:00,235,"http://trailerboats.magnify.net/item/LK21L86830W7NNBL  Link is to a new launching technique, may help if that launch is shallow Johnny"
232662,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-25 13:00:00,0,lol. I just bring it in the water and lift the boat on a 45 and power it off the trailer.
232672,addy79,2008-07-25 13:19:00,573,"canal is a great lake...i like the other side opposite the boat launch.  lots of pike in there in the 24-30 inch range  largies get BIG in canal!! maybe cause they have sooo much cover, im not sure, but you can always pull out a bigun while working weedlines.  walleye, muskies and smallies  are far and few between but can be found.  search for deep water while your there...i think the average depth is about 8ft. so if you find anything 13' or more your golden!  good luck, report back  im sure Reffrunner will put his two cents in once he finishes mopping the floor and checks his OFC..."
232680,danbo,2008-07-25 13:37:00,2646,Night-time is the right time for 'eyes..
232684,Reef Runner,2008-07-25 13:47:00,980,"Lol.  Check my previous reports Johnny.  The launch past the causeway is $6.00 courtesy box, but shallow, as mentioned.   If you want to get to the West end of the lake, you'll have to travel South to the high bridge (""hole in the wall"").  I know the lake very, very well.   PM me if ya got questions.  Oh, Pike have been on this year, all in the 25'-35' range.  Largies are biting, all two pounders, but there are some serious hawgs in there.  Lots of weed growth, tough to fish sometimes.  You'll have luck with the jig-n-pig.  What days are you gonna be there?"
232687,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-25 13:58:00,0,Thanks a lot guys! I guess i will scratch Bass lake and try Canal lake. Hopefully I will have a decent report! Unfortunately it will be hard taking pictures fishing with myself!   But I will try my best!
232688,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-25 14:00:00,0, I'm gonna be there Saturday to Saturday.
