232913,Mark Mc,2008-07-26 01:26:00,8,"Hi, my name is mark and I am a fishoholic.  I'm 29 and have been fishing for about 24 years. There is nothing I love more than the peacefulness of standing in the Notty battling a big steelhead or drifting in the boat on Nippissing for tasty walleye. I've been fishing Nippissing for 24 years and drifting the Notty for 17 years. Come fall time I'm out on the river 2-3 days a week (which I wish could be 5-6 days).  Nice Nippissing walleye   My son with his first walleye   The making of a fishoholic, my son's first trout at the trout pond   And a beauty Notty chromer   If ya see me out there, come say hi."
