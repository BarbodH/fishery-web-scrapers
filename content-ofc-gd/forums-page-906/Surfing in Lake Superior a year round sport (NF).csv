298465,corvette1,2009-01-28 13:12:00,1765,just plain crazy
298473,tinbanger,2009-01-28 13:27:00,1028,And some people think Muskie guys are nuts !   TB
298476,Greencoachdog,2009-01-28 13:33:00,8163,That just doesn't look or sound like very much fun to me.
298478,lunkerbasshunter,2009-01-28 13:38:00,2585,looks like fun  cheers!
298482,bigugli,2009-01-28 13:49:00,6138,"I've talked to some parasurfers on Hamilton beach in December 2 years back.  These guys are willing to travel 2-300 miles overnight to catch that perfect combination of high winds and surf and they don't care how cold it gets.  ""It adds to the rush""."
298494,Leecher,2009-01-28 14:19:00,7832,Amazing what people do to get an adrenaline rush.... I'll stick to ice fishing
298500,Greencoachdog,2009-01-28 14:36:00,8163, Some folks think getting a high colonic (enema) is a rush too... I'll pass on tht one as well!    I'll stick to standing up too fast after a couple of drinks!
298509,Zubris21,2009-01-28 14:58:00,563,  I think this may be a product of their parents laying down too quickly after a couple drinks.
298540,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-28 16:00:00,10439, I agree!!!! For an adrenaline rush I'll stick to trying to hang on to my sled when I pin the throttle or having close encounters with 1000# Grizzlies!!!!!

298555,fishnsled,2009-01-28 16:55:00,3520,My girlfriends brother-in-law loves surfing.  When he moved back to Ontario he took up the sport on the Great Lakes and would surf in the winter as well.  Not a problem to deal with the cold these days since his move back to Australia.
298583,LeXXington,2009-01-28 18:02:00,1928,SHRINKAGE!
298653,Sinker,2009-01-28 21:55:00,8692,"Yep, crazy for sure.  I ran into these guys on Lake ontario last fall on a scouting trip looking for ducks and geese. It was blowing a gale, and FREEZING cold. I had a good long chat with them in the parking lot.......they really are nuts!!! LOL   In he goes.....Notice the ice on the pier.......this was early in the freeze up, so it was glare ice.......super slippery. When they walked out there with thier boards in the wind, they would just slide on the ice, and the wind would pull them off the pier into the water!!     I thought for sure this guy was going to get smashed into the breakwall!!    Waiting for the perfect breaker...BRRRRR    Heres a shot to show just how rough it was out there that day!!!!    Sinker"
