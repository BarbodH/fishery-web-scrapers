298595,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-28 18:41:00,1362,Went out around 4:00PM yesterday to enjoy the clear skies and not so windy afternoon..    Drilled a couple of holes and found the weedbed/shoal I normally like to work..    The eyes were hitting hard but that was it....if you weren't on the ball after the first tap they were gone  Went 3 for 7 and kept 2 for the fry pan...  I was cleaning the last eye and all of a sudden I got lucky and got some free minnows for the salt tub    What a difference in weather between yesterday and now!!!.....It's making me think twice about heading out soon  
298604,tinbanger,2009-01-28 19:10:00,1028,yesterday was the day . been snowing all day here .  hopefully tomorrow will be decent  cool pics by the way  TB
298607,Whitespinnerbait,2009-01-28 19:20:00,2038,"Don't worry about today Steve ,,Saturday is the Day ........Can you say Monster Whitie    P.S save some of those eyes for us The Amigo's"
298608,johnnyb,2009-01-28 19:29:00,3413,nice eye!  And nice free bait    Looks like it's hardly been used...real low mileage...
298615,Leecher,2009-01-28 19:55:00,7832,Great report and pics Steve  Them eyes are getting bigger as the season progress     Good job Did you get any saugers?  Thanks for sharing Jacques
298618,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-28 19:59:00,3761,"Nice report! I can't wait to have walleye again, it's been a few years since i last had some.  Thank's for sharing"
298684,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-28 22:57:00,1362,"Thanks guys...  Paul, I'm pumped for some Whitie action this Saturday  ......Weather forecast is looking good too!!!!...As far as leaving some Walleye for the amigos, there are LOTS left here in the river  ....we should start to see some of the bigger females move in to the area in the next little while  Jacques...I haven't caught any Saugers for the past 3 outings now...only Walleye."
298702,Leecher,2009-01-28 23:35:00,7832, I just bought some foxee's today on my way home and can't wait to put them to use I've also bought a spool of Power Pro Ice microfilament 15lbs and got it spooled on my reel.  That stuff is real strong line and is the diameter of 4lb.  It sure is going to be fun since the weather will be cooperating  only walleyes..... maybe it's a sign that the bigger eyes are moving in  Where are we meeting Saturday?? Jacques
298703,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-28 23:40:00,1362, Talk to Paul....
