Only managed a dozen perch over the course of the afternoon.  It was nice out. The sun was shining, the air was crisp and there was no wind. Only brought a handful of keepers home.   Fresh perch and a corn fritter.  YumYum!"

298507,Leecher,2009-01-28 14:49:00,7832,Good going Bruce That really looks good
298508,Zubris21,2009-01-28 14:52:00,563,  Edamame is excellent.   You can buy a box full of portioned sized packages at costco.   Just throw them in the microwave for 3 mins and all salt.  Not as good as in sushi bars but still pretty darn good for something thats frozen!
298616,solopaddler,2009-01-28 19:58:00,8605, Meat sweats HAHA!
