And in my old tackle box i found these worms, about a dozen of them. And this is a box i have not used for atleast 5 years so these baits are old. They look to be new and i have no clue what they are  Can anybody give me a guess as to what these soft plastic baits might be please. Also how would i use them this upcoming bass season?"
298613,Mr Twister,2009-01-28 19:52:00,71,Older style plastic worms which would work good texas rigged!
298614,johnnyb,2009-01-28 19:53:00,3413,"Look like a mister-twister phenom, except with a paddle tail.  Rig'em up a few different ways and see what happens...texas, wacky, go nuts!  We will know your report by the tagline ""Mystery Basement Worms = Lunker Bass"""
298626,Terry,2009-01-28 20:17:00,14456,paddle tail  good for dark/muddy water
298627,kemper,2009-01-28 20:28:00,2232,"Ive got a package of those somewhere...  I remember my dad hooking a musky one night up on buckhorn with one. Bass tackle, three bass fishermen, a 14 ft alum. boat, and approaching pitch black.  That was an adventure"
298643,jediangler,2009-01-28 21:26:00,1923,Looks like old Berkeley floating power finesse worm. Throw one in water and see if it floats. Great for Carolina rigging as you can control how far off bottom the worm will be. If it sinks...never mind   .
298655,steverowbotham,2009-01-28 21:59:00,1800,I use them a lot in cold water... late fall largemouth
298656,misfish,2009-01-28 22:03:00,29133, I know where theres some dirty water. Just got to wait for say 6 months.  Nice find.

298732,Abberz,2009-01-29 00:50:00,140,Look like Culprit Paddle Tails to me
298819,OhioFisherman,2009-01-29 02:53:00,6623,"Manns jelly worms? I think, haven`t seen them around for a while.  Think I am wrong on that, unless they changed the look?"
