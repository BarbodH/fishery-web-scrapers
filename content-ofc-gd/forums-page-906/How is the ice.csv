298105,bigbear1972,2009-01-27 14:19:00,1,I am planning a weekend fishing trip and would like to know how thick the ice is on Timmins area lakes. I am thinking of bringing the kids out to Nighthawk lake.

298867,irishfield,2009-01-29 04:59:00,26272,Temagami is 18 inches at my dock.. 14 inches on the main lake. Probably similar a few hours up the road. About a foot of snow on the ice and LOTS and LOTS of slush !
