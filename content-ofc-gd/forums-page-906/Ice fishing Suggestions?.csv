Not looking to spend a small fortune, and not interested in Lake Simcoe, or Nippissing.  Just looking for nice accommodations with decent fishing....she gets bored sitting in a hut all day with no fish biting......don't we all.  We both realized that we have the same 3 days off   and looking to spend some quiet time together. Thanks for any suggestions  Cheers Jason"

298254,davew3,2009-01-27 21:14:00,430,There is a place on Oak Lake just the other side of Peterborough you might like.  I forget the name.  Maybe someone else remembers. There are lots out there though. Good luck.
