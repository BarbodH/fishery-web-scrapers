Now 21 years old and driving i can recall biking to this lake some 10 or 12 miles back when i was 15. I have now fished it a good dozen times, spring summer, fall, winter,   and to no avail! had one get off 4 years ago and saw a couple down the hole through the ice 2 years ago but would not bite! None the less i figured a day of getting skunked would be better than sitting at home watchin the tube or sorting soft plastics for the spring.   we managed to hit the lake at about 11 bells and set our lines and set up the deer hunting blind. very windy and even on a small lake i would have never lasted without it!  so we were sitting in the blind jiggin away when i thought i heard a subtle ""ding ding""  i look out the window and sure enough a small tap on one of the switches, i ran out to the line and grabbed ahold, and had a very short game of tug of war and knew she was on so i set the hook and pulled her up finally the skunk is off!!!!!   so for the first time ever i have caught a rainbow trout, needless to say i had to cut her open and find out what they're eating in there and to my suprise it was'nt bugs flies or insect   it was full of SMALL 1/2"" to 1"" stickle back minnows probably about 15 of them. we manged to stay until 1630 and never got another bite. but none the less the company was good the grilled cheese were yummy and the DISSARONO was chilled!  a great day was had and another is in the works again before the end of the week! she was no monster at 1lb 1oz but at 14 3/4 inches she gets team 6 on the board!  stylin catch (rob) was not pretty stylin' today with the new hat too!   Matt!      "

298032,BassAsin,2009-01-27 04:40:00,806,"it feels great! she sure was a beauty coloured fish. and as for ""she"" i dont know no eggs or milt?  in it when i cleaned it up but the head feautures of a female!   and as for cracking the code, it may take a while but good to know what this fish was eating, it makes for a big big help!"
