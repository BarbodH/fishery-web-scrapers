297684,Kirk,2009-01-26 17:44:00,347,"If there's one thing I've learned from fishing boards is this:  1) either a negative review is posted by competitors and their on-line friends/family (common on-line behaviour) or its really true and, most importantly,  2) determining whether the review is true or false is not better than a coin toss  I pick services and products based on people I know and trust, face to face in the real world, not on-line shills or anti-shills."
297936,Rizzo,2009-01-27 01:19:00,4754,"So you wouldn't trust these reviews Kirk? I would say the evidence is overwhelming and I'm one of the biggest skeptics out there. One or two negatives, with differing opinions from those who have had a positive experience may lead to doubt, but I'm not seeing too many supporting this operation. I don't know any hut operators out there, nor do I have anything to gain by providing a review, but I do know what I was told by people who had the snowfari ""experience"" and it wasn't good."
297955,snag,2009-01-27 02:15:00,1932,I'm with Riz
298139,Kirk,2009-01-27 15:53:00,347,"Hi Riz: On other boards, Lake Simcoe outfitters would post 'negative' reports from people just taking time out of their busy day to help out others and 'warn' them...it was common for this to be their competition and their friends would post as well to make it sound like a crowd of people that were screwed over.  The flip side was 'positive reports', again from family and friends, again bearing no relation to the truth.  So, its not that I trust or don't trust a report, I just ignore them as the noise that comes with an ice fishing season that is very short and very competitive and some years does not happen at all due to a lack of ice which increases the pressure on everyone to make hay while the sun shines.  I have my short list of outfitters, friends that go on Simcoe (with their GPS markers for structure, hot spots etc) and the outfitters they trust, and most days nothing beats going out on your own.  I use outfitters only on really cold days which require a hut or shelter or if I am taking people icefshing for their first time."
298178,Jay T,2009-01-27 17:32:00,282," First off I am not an outfitter, just a regular joe that loves to hunt and fish.  Well you can ingnore all the posts and go give him YOUR business then. Like you said ""it is a very short season"" that is why I started the post so it would warn people that they are wasting thier hard earned money, like my whole group did.  Also, I mostly go out with my portable with buddy's or myself if it is close to home, this was a weekend trip away from home"
298181,Kirk,2009-01-27 17:49:00,347,"Sorry if you were offended.  I don't believe everything I read on the internet, and like I said in my first post, there are posts with truthful accurate content, there is just no way of proving it.  I guess 100% of all posts contain true information?"
298286,Lowe Rider,2009-01-27 22:42:00,79," Not all but you would like to think the person that went through the trouble to start the tread is telling the truth. To be honest I never thought of someone starting a thread to voice a problem would be doing it to submarine someones business. To me that's just low. I don't believe everything I read or watch either but I believe the original poster because it was very similar to our experience there. Good point though, made me think."
298289,Terry,2009-01-27 22:55:00,14456,"when people sign up to here just to post a great review or a real bad review, I take it with a grain of salt but with a good number of posts I tend to take them at their word and when  members with over 1000 post under their belt tell the same story, I take it as gospel  I read all post about good service and bad service I think I can tell the ones that are not real reviews"
298300,misfish,2009-01-27 23:44:00,29133,"I seen all the pages and thought why not have a look see.  I only gots one question????????????????  Why do ya all go so far, when ya gots Simcoe right here????????????????????? Perch lakers whities crappie walleye   One thing I forgot to say,the net is very powerful. It gets the WORD out there quick. Weather good or bad. Everyone has thier thoughts and opinions on someone or something.  Carry on."
298451,Disspatcher,2009-01-28 11:18:00,73,"I dont think any outfitters on Simcoe offer the big ice bungalows. Sounds like a big cash flow oppourtunity for someone!  Where's my hammer....  Few years back when ""the guys"" started to make the yearly trek to Nippising, Snowfari was the only game in town with 8 and then the huge 10 man huts. We booked with them 2 years in a row. Now it seems more outfitters are building them. cough..Grump & Grumpies..cough cough.. :"
298459,Big Cliff,2009-01-28 12:50:00,6899,"When I see good reports about outfitters or products from people I know and trust, I believe them. When I see bad reports about outfitters or products from people I know and trust, I believe them too. If I am unsure of the source of the information, I investigate and them make my own decision. In this case, I can assure you that if I was booking a trip up there for a weekend, I wouldn't be taking a chance on this outfitter. If after all of the reports on here you want to then by all means go for it and we'd love to see your report and pictures, simple as that!"
298606,Kirk,2009-01-28 19:19:00,347,"I wouldn't book with snowfari either...but for the same reason as I would not book with an operator that got a good review.  I have my own experiences and those of a few I ice fish with.  Going off internet postings is gambling.  I have more than a few files of people burned by 'reputable' (on the internet) movers, jewellers and other trades.  I have never built a thing in my life, but who wants to bet I could have a professional looking web site within 7 days, and could I get 1 or 10 or 20 people (friends and family) to post reviews here and there on the net?  throw in some bad reviews for local competitors and next thing you know I am bidding on completing your home reno and hoping its easy and the guys on duty at Home Depot will be able to talk me thru it as I do it the first time.  or maybe take a healthy initial deposit and not show up again (happened to a more than a few friends of mine)  As for 'submarining' competitors, it was a common occurence on another web site.  Internet bashing is on the tame side, arson and violent crimes are at the other extreme."
298617,workwear,2009-01-28 19:59:00,592,althought kirk you make a good point you do have to take into acc't where this info is coming from......  from your original post it seems to  me at least that you have said this whole  COMMUNITY   is wrong in thier opinions and are not valued to have some merit.....   i think this board is unique as to the many friends and relationships that are made on here.....   what you are reffering to is somewhere other than here where ppl dont really know each other....i for one have met some very great ppl here and consider them friends.....   look at how many ppl have comntributed to this thread....you think everyone could be wrong...  where there is smoke there is fire....
298620,Kirk,2009-01-28 20:04:00,347,"Fine Workwear, and everyone else, I was not intending to insult anyone, I will take my grain of salt and put it on my pizza.  "
298633,misfish,2009-01-28 20:46:00,29133, It has crossed my mind a couple of times.
298642,snoil,2009-01-28 21:23:00,139,Methinks what Kirk was saying was don't believe everything you read on the internet.Good advice.But i also think i would not book with this operator.Also good advice.Anyone one have any do's or don't on Simcoe? I've booked with Tim Hales based on what i've read here and also the area i would like to fish. All in all a good thread in these hard time$ our money need$ to be well $pent!
298651,fishermccann,2009-01-28 21:50:00,655,All info. is good... you just have to  weed out the crap
298679,Looner,2009-01-28 22:53:00,2,"Floyd Hales in Beaverton....Lake Simcoe ...has some 4 man ice bungalows ,new this year.I've never used them....yet.....but I've seen pictures on their website. $180.00 for a weekend.So you were right Diss it wont take long......."
298787,duber,2009-01-29 02:01:00,220,I only offer my experience and opinion.What you do with it is your choice.
297396,sirfish,2009-01-26 01:49:00,175,As usual the posse jumps on someone who does'nt echo your opinions. Maybe they did have a good time you don't know. Damn it it is a public board RESPECT thier opinions. You were'nt there !!!  Back to the topic at hand. I will agree that Snowfari is not a client pleasing operation. I have seen it in action while using another operator. Its almost as if someone set thier kid up with a lemonade stand and he don't care one iota if it goes piss warm. With the amount of people that book huts even if he sucks he will get the overflow. After last season they purchased Jim Bows huts from Astorville to add to thier arsenal but....and this is a big but..they didn't get the GPS co-ordinates that Jim used to put his huts out. He never stayed close to shore and his huts always produced. He even came and took us to day trips to shoals that were awesome. From the pics that I have seen this year all the huts are close in.....Duh.  I know that fishing has been rough with the lake still being stained and all but don't you think that they would explore new locations for thier huts.Nope. They will sit there all season.  Hopefully they will get a wake up call in the near future....but I doubt it.
297401,pidge,2009-01-26 01:52:00,438,"Hey guys I like to read alot of your posts, but rarely will post. After reading some senarioes about this safari place it just dose sound pretty bad. Anynoe looking to do a ice bungalow weekend otta give Mark and Shelly a call at Anglers Haven. I organized a weekend last year for 6 of us and everyone had one of the best times of there lives. Except for myself the rest havent been ice fishing before. They've got a fellow by the name of Skunk who was just a all around great guy to chew the fat with and he provided top notch service. Minnows, ran out-no problem, piss buckets full-no problem, genny out of gas-no problem (ran out of gas in the genny, he was out there in 5 minuts with a top up, thumbs up) The cabins were clean and very warm. I cant say enough nice things about these people who provided us with a great experience. So great we rebooked with them this year again. If anyone is trying to find an outfitter look no further, tightlines Greg."
295312,Jer,2009-01-21 13:31:00,1426,"To be fair, we had no issues with the quality of the bungalow. Biggest problem with the place is he just plunks his bungalows just offshore (sounds like the same spot every year, very handy for him I guess) and then expects you to drive yourself out on the lake to his ""adventure"" huts (they're an adventure alright) for any possibility of catching a fish. The water was 12 of mud where our bungalow was last year. He made no excuses about why the bungalows were where they were, that's just the way he did things. Hard to say he couldn't get his huts out due to ice conditions and then send you out on your own in your car. He offered no alternative if someone wasn't comfortable driving their vehicle on the ice, nor did he mention anything about offering no transportation when we booked.  It was about -20C when we were there and the one day we did follow him out to the ""adventure"" huts with my buddy begrudgingly behind the wheel of his minivan. These huts were tiny little 6' x 6' jobbys with no seats, awkward holes right in the corners crusted over with about 2"" of ice that Ron neglected to bust out or leave us with anything to do so, strict orders from Ron not spill any snow on the floor??, a propane burner that Ron neglected to light for us or ask if we might have a lighter or any matches (which we did but it was too cold to get it to burn). By the time we figgered all this out, Ron was gone, also neglecting to leave us any minnows. We didn't bother with the hut (I think it was colder inside than out) and went and jigged a few holes that some other guys were just leaving. We stuck it out for a couple hours, managed one slot size pickerel and headed back to the bungalow once our beer started freezing faster than we could drink it.  Great service Ron offers. (insert sarcasm)  Wouldn't be so bad if you knew what to expect heading up and have all the gear for your own adventure (sleds, augers, portables, etc) and just use the bungalow as a HQ (and pay accordingly). This isn't what we expected having been to a lot of different operators over the years."

295340,forrest,2009-01-21 14:30:00,1032," Why do something unproductive like that copy/paste? A link would suffice or maybe the google ranking is good enough.  Even better, an email to Jim78"
295342,coreyL,2009-01-21 14:35:00,15,did u guys catch anything
295348,fishinggeek,2009-01-21 14:45:00,325,Thanks for this thread.  Another establishment that doesn't cater to their customers it seems.  I'll scratch it off my list.
295056,Greencoachdog,2009-01-20 17:49:00,8163,"It really makes you wonder why though, with so many good outfitters on the lake... why would this guy do such a crappy job?  Or is he just too ignorant to realize he's hurting his business?"
295057,Disspatcher,2009-01-20 17:59:00,73,"He knows the business is hurting, just collects what he can now. He actually called me early December to see if our group was going up there this year??? The last time we were booked with him was 2 years ago! He is really trying to drum up business.  Give Carl a call at Grump & Grumpy's....dont waste you time or money."
295063,Jay T,2009-01-20 18:46:00,282,"WOW, didn't realize how many people he has done this too. He can only blame himself and his staff for what they have done.  Thanks for all the feed back"
295092,johnb,2009-01-20 21:22:00,15,I could'nt agree more with the negative comments. The only reason he has his operation there is acsess. At best that spot is only productive in the first week of the season and thats it. I have sent buisness his way in the past with nothing but negative feedback. Wont do it again. It does seem like his reputation is catching up with him and thats unfortunate. I hate to see anybody do poorly in the fishing buisness but he's doing it to himself. The good news is there is lots of other operators on the lake who appreicate the buisness and work hard to please their customers. John B
