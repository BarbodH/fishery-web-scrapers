297705,rob v,2009-01-26 18:52:00,535,I've used an electric knife cleaning larger fish (walleye etc) plenty of times and recently considered getting one of the electric filleting knives for all my fish cleaning - including pan fish etc.  I had my eye on the electric rapala - not the cordless model but the ac/dc model.  Anyone have any experience with this unit  good or bad ?  thx.
297711,Potsie225,2009-01-26 19:12:00,8,That was my Christmas present this year.  My daughter got mine from Cableas and it is the AC/DC unit.  I have yet to use it but saw one of my friends use it on a fishing trip and it worked great.  I have always used a electric knife for removing the skin.  Mine is the Rapala.  Doug

297775,PERCHER,2009-01-26 21:04:00,787,I also have the Storm model.I bought it from Wally Mart for 29.99.It works fantastic.Cleans every thing from Salmon to Perch.

297802,Scott S,2009-01-26 21:31:00,203,"I have the same one you are talking. I've had it for 4years and don't leave home without it. Once you get used to it, you can do everything with. I do mostly walleye and can clean them in half the time, compared to  using a regular knife. Well worth the money for my satisfaction. Scooter"
297845,Silo Buster,2009-01-26 23:00:00,81,My son got me one (rapala ac\dc) one for xmas last year and love it for walleye and lakers.I can cut thru a pike in a fraction of the time it used to take me with a regular knife.  Great for carving xmas turkey or chicken.    Once you get on to it you will love it.
297872,Bitsmith2k,2009-01-26 23:58:00,396, my wife picked it up for me for xmas last year.. i think she was a little upset that it was my favourite present.. lol..
297882,tdotfisherman,2009-01-27 00:05:00,317,I need to invest in one of those electric knives.. i'm tired of it taking 30 minutes to fully clean one Northern Pike..
297889,Mike the Pike,2009-01-27 00:09:00,3421,Oh ya get the Rapala one I love mine funs on ac dc and 12 volt. Problem with a regular knife is you are constantly sharpenning them not the case with the electric knives.  Does anyone know a good system for sharpenning regular knives that little thing from Rapala is no good?
298043,crappieperchhunter,2009-01-27 05:15:00,2582,"Got my electric Rapala knife from Santa for xmas 2007. I can not believe how good it is, once I got the hang of it. It works especially well for smaller perch which surprised the hell outta me, as I thought it would just butcher them up and leave alot of waste. I get no more waste then doing it with my regular rapala knife and it is faster. Although I am pretty quick at filleting so it really isn't alot faster....but it is a lot less mess.  If I have only a few fish to clean I just use my hand knife. But if I have a mess of crappies or perch the electric comes out."
298069,sonny,2009-01-27 12:13:00,511,It is definatly one of those new fishing items that has become a must have!
298206,bukee,2009-01-27 18:46:00,58,"Got the rapala last year and it's great on everything from perch to pike.  Get one, you'll love it."
298280,solopaddler,2009-01-27 22:26:00,8605,"For those that like the Rap knife I've donated one for the Fishing For Tyler prize table..  I'm definitely in the minority here, but there's no way, no how I can fillet faster with an electric compared to regular knife. To me they're a waste...  To me they're akin to the ""Knot Tyer"". They used to hawk this little brass knot tying tool at all the sports shows back in the day. Back then I used to work the shows myself and kidded Jim Westman (the guy at the knot tying booth) that his product was useless and that I could tie the knot faster with my hands. It bugged him so much he finally set up a demonstration in front of a large group of onlookers.  The tool would tie an ordinary clinch knot. I told him not only would I beat him but I'd tie an improved clinch. The stakes were high, a pitcher of beer in the exhibitors lounge  .  Needless to say I tied the improved clinch in 3.2 seconds and won the beer.  When I offered to give his potential customers knot tying lessons he wasn't too impressed.  Learn how to use a regular knife properly. (Just my opinion  )"
