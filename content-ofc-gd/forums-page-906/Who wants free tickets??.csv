297771,diggyj,2009-01-26 20:59:00,548,I'm definately going. If I am not fortunate enough to win tickets I will just use my discount coupons. I have seen them at Tightlines in Pickering and at Lucky Tackle in Scarborough if anyone is interested. I'm sure most of the bait and tackle stores have them.  Would be nice if they had a list of the exhibitors on that website!
