292766,anders,2009-01-15 20:40:00,1168,"I use em, and have no problem with them at all.  Strong and easy to grab your rod."
292770,LeXXington,2009-01-15 20:48:00,1928,"They are fine, just make sure that if you are trolling with strong line that you don't hit bottom.."
292794,denisk,2009-01-15 21:42:00,163,Also check out the RAM rod holders they seem to work good for me and are quite popular among walleye guys.
292797,taper,2009-01-15 21:51:00,611,Daniel I used the Scotty's all last year with no problems what so ever. I was told just make sure when you insert the rod holder into the base give it a smack straight down with your hand. My dealer said the most of the problems they see are due to the holder not being fully seated in the base and then turning.
292800,Fang,2009-01-15 21:57:00,1330,"I run 4 scottys on my boat. 2 rods for lead core and 2 rods with big dipseys. Never had a problem. Even swap out the rigger rods in the scottys when fighting a fish and have to clear lines  I always run a tether line though just in case. Take a 4ft peice of 1/4"" soft rope, not the yellow nylon stuff. Tie one end to your boat cleats and then tie on a carabeener (Climbing clip). I fasten the carabeener around the rod blank in front of the reel. It's quick and easy to pop off when fighting a fish and get's rid of the worry your probably having about loosing a rod.  Now if you go to a wire dispey rod I'd look at something a little more stronger."

292844,young_one,2009-01-15 23:00:00,620,"I use them no problem! I even have the small version model, the one at BPS."
292848,sonny,2009-01-15 23:23:00,511,"scotty's are whats on my boat too,,,use em for dipsy's all summer!"
293180,fishindevil,2009-01-16 16:24:00,6254,"All i use is the scotty powerlock rod holders for salmon & walleye fishing,i have 4of them mounted in my boat andf 2 of them have the 8 inch extensions on them to even hold my planner rods higher of the boat,they are great,they are virtually indestructable,and can be easily installed,and the have several different models too,try their website  www.scotty.com i use them for leadcore,wire dipseys,planner boards you name it,and if one ever does break they will send you another one...cheers"
293181,Headhunter,2009-01-16 16:27:00,5703,"Scottys are great, Cabela's brand are virtually the same and cheaper. HH"
293221,bassjnkie,2009-01-16 18:07:00,1101,"Thanks, I think I will stick with the Scotty's.  Thanks again."
293268,ecmilley,2009-01-16 20:09:00,2163,"the scottys are great as fishindevil mentioned we have been using them for years with no failures, I also use the saltys just because ther quick and easy to mount anywhere"
298159,blackdog_2,2009-01-27 16:29:00,2,"I plan on running a dipsy setup for lakers this year on my small cottage lake.  Being a newbie to dispy fishing, I have done a fair amount of research into rods/reels etc.  Also, I assume a dispy would put a lot of stress on the rod holder and it has been suggested that a strong rod holder and mount is a must.  Stuff like Berts, Traxstech etc.  Nice holder, but expensive.  I have several Scotty Power Lock's mounted on my boat already and I'm glad to hear you guys use them for dipsy's without any problems.  Anyhow, I sent an email off to Scotty's last week asking them if their Power Lock rod holders would be stong enough to troll a dispy diver/flasher/fly combo and here's the response I got.  Yes the Power Lock is strong enough but the action of the dipsy diver has a bad habbit of causing the post to ride up and sometimes out of the 241 base. We now offer a 241-Locking base that eliminates this problem.  Providing you replace the existing base with the 241-Locking base there will be no problems."
