Cook Bay, Lake Simcoe & Lake Couchiching are slowly becoming private lakes . . .    might as well be . . .    very little access ANYWHERE any more!"

(Harry's is at the corner of The Queensway and Riveredge Dr) You will come to a store on the corner of Bayview (on the right). Go right (West) on Bayview and it will curl around to the south and follow the lake shore. There are some parking spots along there, but not a whole lot. As Photoz said the By Law enforcement officer makes a killing, same on the Gilford side and all along the lake.  Good luck with the fishing"
