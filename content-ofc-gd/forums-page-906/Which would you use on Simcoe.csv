298393,Cudz,2009-01-28 03:30:00,2652,I have not been as successful as I would like to be this year on the hardwater on Simcoe. If you had a choice of lure to jig what would it be.  I am after lakers and whitefish in that order. Keep in mind that one hole will have a tip up with spreader using shiners.  In the second hole I will be jigging with:  a ) Williams half and half ice fishing lure  b ) white tube jig  c ) white tube jig tipped with shiner  d ) Bad Boyz jig tipped with microtube   I am leaning toward the williams but if there are any other suggestions please do not hesitate.
298396,Ramble,2009-01-28 03:38:00,713,Jump in the forum we were just talking about..... Bad Boyz jig tipped with microtube  -Dave
298400,Cudz,2009-01-28 03:42:00,2652,Where am I to find this?
298401,johnnyb,2009-01-28 03:47:00,3413,"Cudz -- so far this year I'm seeing the most success on spoons, then bad boyz.  I'm one for two, and it was a silver williams jigging spoon with a small patch of green prism tape.  But most of the success around me has been on spoons...with fish being about 3-4 feet off bottom.  WHen fish were right on bottom, I caught mine, and the guys doing well around me were using bad boyz."

298410,fishnpro,2009-01-28 04:06:00,93,You would be surprised at what 2 split shots and a hook can do out there
298414,richyb,2009-01-28 04:23:00,774,"Williams , I jig with 2 lines , one with a w60 ice jig 1/2 & 1/2 and the other a  w50 williams wobbler. I seem to get my share of fish."
298419,Cudz,2009-01-28 04:37:00,2652,You jig with 2 lines at once?  Am I reading that right? so are your hole like 4 ft apart?
298455,12footspringbok,2009-01-28 12:25:00,459,"Not that i've had alot of luck with lakers on simcoe, but my best luck has come on a blue/silver little cleo tipped with  a small minnow jigged right on bottom. After that i'd go with the williams."
298470,Gerritt,2009-01-28 13:19:00,6129,The Simcoe Bug....But shhhhhh.... I never told you that...  G
298761,rhare,2009-01-29 01:26:00,387,"save your money and leave the minnows  I would take a large 1/2 and 1/2 and and pack of white zoom tubes.  start with the spoon, work the bottom  do you have a finder?"
298771,richyb,2009-01-29 01:35:00,774,"  Yeah 2 lines at once.. Cut a hole right infront of me and then one about 4 feet to my left. I put a stick across the 2nd hole for the line to slide on, sit on my sled and jig away. The second line is more of a sideways jig that slides on the stick over the 2nd hole. If you dont put something over the hole for the line to slide on , the line will freeze into the ice. Sure is fun when a fish hits the 2nd line     YEHAWWWWWWWWW"
298776,Sinker,2009-01-29 01:41:00,8692,"  Its even more fun when you get one on each!! Sometimes not so much fun when you get one on either, and it wraps up in the other  Every fish I've caught from simcoe this season so far has been on the badboy tipped with a 2"" tube. I did, however, snag a laker,  right in the side,  with a williams  What a pain in the   getting that one up the hole to get my lure back!!  I'm a die hard williams fan though. I don't go icefishing anywhere without a rod rigged with a williams.  Sinker"
