BUT..............  i was wondering something.  we didnt get a single bite on the tip-ups.  how do you guys make out on the tip ups.  we rigged them with small dead minnows but didnt get any bumbs nimble...NOTHING!  i KNOW you guys have something up your sleeves!  all you simcoe fisherman must have some type of technique we could use here on the QC side!  any help would be much apreciated!  we are heading back next saturday. lets see if we locate them this time!  24/7
297895,Sinker,2009-01-27 00:21:00,8692,"Whities will usually pick up a bait off bottom. Set a minnow right on bottom, but have your tip up set so if a fish picks it up, it will lift up, instead of going down. I use a slip float myself. If a fish picks up my bait, the float will lay flat in the hole......if it takes it....It will sink.......most times though, it just twitches a little in the hole. If it moves at all......set the hook, you got one!!  Sinker"
297909,richyb,2009-01-27 00:40:00,774,On my tip ups I use the 3 way spreader to sit on bottom and then about 3 feet up i have a single hook. When the whitie bits on bottom the stick goes up and when they bite the top hook it goes down. I had a trout almost take my stick into the hole by nailing the top hook the other day.
298277,Fishing 24/7,2009-01-27 22:16:00,709,these techniques are hard to understand.............   you place yout tip up half way down?  when he picks up the bottom minnow the tip up goes up. and the top minnow it goes down.........  HMmmMmMmm.  anybody use fishfry for whitefish.?  maybe our minnows were two big?
298281,solopaddler,2009-01-27 22:30:00,8605, Pretty self explanatory and the way man has been fishing for whitefish since he started wrapping line around a wooden stick.
298288,wallacio,2009-01-27 22:54:00,475,"In short, the spreader should be on bottom and the line should not have any slack all the way up to your tip-up.   This means the tip up is balanced ie horizontal (though some like to set it pointing down slightly or up slightly).    When a Whitefish picks up the spreader from the bottom, the tip-up arm moves up.  Some like to add a third (or forth) single hook a short distance up from the spreader in order catch cruising Whities or Lakers.   If a fish strikes this hook, generally the tip-up arm will move down.  Sometimes live minnows (vs dead) will help to elicit a strike from more finicky fish but this isn't an option in Quebec.  Hope that helps."
298297,Beans,2009-01-27 23:27:00,3339,I've always used a two-way spreader with my tip-ups...I found the three-way was one too many hooks to get caught on the ice at the bottom of the hole when bringing up a fish...mostly used 2 to 2 1/2 inch emerald shiners either live or salted for whitefish...
298298,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-27 23:33:00,1362," Hey Kev....I will show you when we go up this Saturday  ....yes..I'm going to join the amigos...  ...I will bring my ""salties"""
298336,Fishing 24/7,2009-01-28 01:14:00,709,AWESOME NEWS STEVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   cant wait NOW!
298503,Mike Pike,2009-01-28 14:38:00,1332,"Personally, I've only used live minnows on a spreader set up.  Lively minnow, I think, enduce more strikes.  Plus, if you have your tip up set up reeeeal sensative, you can watch the minnow action transmitted on your tip up.  It starts to bounce around slightly, especially when whities come nosing around and making the minnows nervous."
