296984,Markystang,2009-01-25 06:22:00,131,Congrats man! ...and I know the feeling. I just bought a boat last month...lol!
297002,Big Cliff,2009-01-25 12:52:00,6899,"I am so sorry for your luck! Give me the address and I will make a special trip to get it and haul it away for you. Since you are a valued member of the OFC, I won't even charge you for doing it (please remember to leave the keys and registration where I can easily find them)  Seriously; Beautiful package, not quite my style but I sure wouldn't mind owning one!"
297080,David Chong,2009-01-25 16:59:00,836,"Congratulations!!!! The best bass boat & the best motor made. You'll love it!!!! Good luck this up-coming season! Cheers, Dave"
297110,Stoty,2009-01-25 18:18:00,2910,"Thanks Dave, I can't wait!"
297112,Cudz,2009-01-25 18:21:00,2652,you're biased. lol I would agree with the best bass boat made.  Yamaha I would say is the most reliable.
297467,nancur373,2009-01-26 03:39:00,1211,Sweet ride. What is a jack plate and what does it do?   Curt
297475,Stoty,2009-01-26 04:03:00,2910, A jack plate allows the prop to run in cleaner water as to accommodate a higher engine height which leads to faster top end speeds and shallow water running. Less of the lower unit is in the water resulting in reduced drag. The prop is further away from the transom to avoid the boats turbulence as it travels through the water.  Basically...makes you go smoother/faster.
297545,aniceguy,2009-01-26 13:29:00,1094,  lmao someone has been reading up on things
297713,Stoty,2009-01-26 19:13:00,2910,It's true! I've been doing my homework!
297758,ecmilley,2009-01-26 20:39:00,2163,welcome to the ranger club your gonna love it and with the 4-stroke decent mileage as well
297765,aniceguy,2009-01-26 20:54:00,1094,he will love the boat until his first clubbie and he sees a triton stream past him
297780,corvette1,2009-01-26 21:08:00,1765,awesome ride
297940,LeXXington,2009-01-27 01:26:00,1928,"Very nice boat, congrats.  With the thinkness of simcoe ice, it may be a while till you get to open her up"
297958,fishindevil,2009-01-27 02:22:00,6254,The new #1 girl in your life !!!!!  nice rig bud....cheers
298243,Stoty,2009-01-27 20:48:00,2910," Well...since ""Triton guys"" are far inferior with their fishing skills to ""Ranger guys"", we like giving you a head start!"
298245,aniceguy,2009-01-27 20:52:00,1094, now that waas a good one!!!!!
298246,Stoty,2009-01-27 20:56:00,2910,"Ha ha ha, I thought you would like that one!"
298247,aniceguy,2009-01-27 20:57:00,1094,ya made me chuckle. . . . . . . now wait till us triton guys start flippin a jig off the bow and you need to get away the weight of the hull makes it tough in cpomparision to a triton akin to a tank and a svelt swimmer
298261,Stoty,2009-01-27 21:33:00,2910,lol.  means it's durable!
298268,ecmilley,2009-01-27 21:56:00,2163,don't worry stoty had my ranger in 3-4 ft'rs the nitro and trition guys were hiding in the back bays
298315,Stoty,2009-01-28 00:28:00,2910,"Ha ha ha, nice."
298325,mbac31,2009-01-28 00:57:00,904,Hey Stoty. No need to wait that long. First warm day I'll take mine out with ya. Launch out of the bluffs. I run mine all winter still. Fishin near the mouth of Frenchmens bay is still good at times. Usually by the end of Feb or first week in March.  PS. What type of Jackplate are you gonna run. Depends on what you plan on doing or rigging that with. You dont gain alot of speed on most boats with a Jackplate. I have put several on boats of mine. I'm putting the new atlas on my boat this spring. Sure is nice in the shallows though.
298349,aniceguy,2009-01-28 01:53:00,1094,"lol see stoty how the ranger guys get when the sled gets talked about   ( INSERT DR EVILS LAUGH) Smallie is right maybe 3-5 miles but it will cost the JP and a new prop as your going to have to change that with the plate more then likely, seeing the boat and hearing the great report from your mechanic on it my opinion. . . . .  run it  . .  gun it and enjoy the boat while its not a toon its the next best thing"
298388,Stoty,2009-01-28 03:25:00,2910,"Ya, not gonna spend anymore on it right now, lol.  Smalliefisher, I will keep that in mind, once it warms up a bit! Thanks!"
296714,highdrifter,2009-01-24 19:05:00,2534,AWESOME.  Atta boy!  My rig is stashed out on the balcony right now..  good fishing mang  HD
296717,misfish,2009-01-24 19:15:00,29133,Thats one sweet clean ride there.  Enjoy.
296721,lew,2009-01-24 19:33:00,12767,That's a great looking boat and it's always nice to see man finally get something he's waited a long time for !!
296722,Mark Kulik,2009-01-24 19:39:00,348,Nice rig Stoty!-gonna be a long winter!
296732,danbouck,2009-01-24 20:10:00,4380,Very Nice!
296733,Stoty,2009-01-24 20:12:00,2910,Thanks everyone!  Yes...it's almost torture not being able to run that thing for another 3 mths or so!
296734,misfish,2009-01-24 20:14:00,29133,Is the launch at port credit open? Just teasing ya.But it maybe open??????????
296737,charlesn,2009-01-24 20:23:00,551,"Congrats, you will love it.  Only about 80 more sleeps and you should be able to at least sit in it without wearing a survival suit.  lol  They say the happiest two days of a boat owner are the day you pick it up and the day you sell it...  Expensive toy and no doubt a luxury item that many will never get to have.  Consider yourself blessed and enjoy that thing as much as possible.  Charles"
296740,aniceguy,2009-01-24 20:34:00,1094,lol PC will open in a few weeks . . .
296751,medmart,2009-01-24 21:01:00,587,Nice ride Stoty have fun when the soft water gets here
296755,lunkerbasshunter,2009-01-24 21:04:00,2585,what a beauty!!!!!  your going to have fun in the soft water for sure!  cheers!
296762,tinbanger,2009-01-24 21:14:00,1028,nice ride !!!!!  TB
296783,HTHM,2009-01-24 22:09:00,4082,Now I understand what all the fuss was about. That is a very nice hole in the water. I think Niagara is open water.......
296791,Dusky,2009-01-24 22:18:00,310,What a sleek ride!!! Congrates and enjoy!!
296802,Cudz,2009-01-24 22:45:00,2652,That is even nicer than I pictured in my head!!!!
296804,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-24 22:51:00,1362,Congrats....looks too good to be sittin' in a driveway
296822,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-24 23:36:00,3761,Nice boat man. WOW sure are lucky to own that beauty!
296841,Pigeontroller,2009-01-25 00:15:00,2793,"Very nice! I like the Yammy fourstroke! What size? I'm guessing thats a 150Hp...Lake Erie will be frozen soon, the Lower Niagara will be clear, lots of open water down there..."
296854,Radnine,2009-01-25 00:43:00,1538,Congrats Stoty! That boat is slicker than a Wiesel's privates. You have no idea how much better your summer just got. Jim
296892,JeffBornFishin,2009-01-25 02:11:00,260,"Congrats on the Ranger Stoty!  Looks in mint condition.  Ya better chain that beauty up before it ""walks away"" or is it in the garage?  Cheer up only a couple months to go!"
296920,Hooked,2009-01-25 03:13:00,891,"Man, that's a sweet ride!  And it looks like its in MINT shape.  The only draw back is bugs hitting your face at ridiculous speeds with that thing.  Congrats and enjoy."
296924,jwl,2009-01-25 03:21:00,1056,"nice going!, glad it all worked out for you, I bet you will be sitting on the edge of the couch for months now, or pacing around the house looking out the window to see the boat..maybe sitting in it on a nice day pretending you are booting down the lake making little motor rev noises with your mouth so the neighbours will be looking at you like"
296931,Stoty,2009-01-25 03:34:00,2910," HAHAH!   Well, I am sure they are already doing that after seeing me WASH it down this morning, just before taking the pictures!! So...I might as well just continue ""crazy"" things!"
296934,Stoty,2009-01-25 03:41:00,2910, It's a 115 4-stroke. Apparently it will hit about 47-50MPH (for now). That is..until I put a jack plate on it
296974,young_one,2009-01-25 05:49:00,620,"A very nice ride! I bet you can't wait until the bass season opens! Im jelouse, about the boat, more so that you can park it on your drive way. Where I live, the stupid zooning law perhibits me from doing that. I always thought a house with a boat on the driveway looks expensive and classy."
296621,Stoty,2009-01-24 15:51:00,2910,"Well, it finally happened!! Picked up my new rig yesterday with the help of Luis (""aniceguy"").  Here she is!  My Ranger  Special thanks again to Luis for sharing his expertise and time with me! Much appreciated!"
296623,canadian_copper,2009-01-24 15:53:00,925,beauty bro!!! and lou sure knows his stuff too!!!
296624,BUSTER,2009-01-24 15:54:00,1336,SHOTGUN!!!
296625,tibbs,2009-01-24 15:55:00,650,Beauty Boat man!  I bet you can't wait till soft water season!
296629,grt1,2009-01-24 15:58:00,638,"you are one lucky guy!!! That is the boat I would love to have, but my wife tells me that I will be wearing cement overshoes and divorced if Ievver brought one home. She HATES bass boats and I think a new boat with higher sides to keep her safe is cheaper than a divorce.  Congratulations on your ride, enjoy it and maybe think of us unfortunate souls once in a while."
296630,GBW,2009-01-24 15:59:00,8460,HAHAHAHA!  Nice ride for sure!
296631,kickingfrog,2009-01-24 15:59:00,8333,NICE!!!  How do you ice fish out of that???  Since I have a large posterior I will graciously volunteer to help keep a seat warm when you take it out.
296633,Stoty,2009-01-24 16:00:00,2910,"Hahah, thanks guys! It's been my lifelong dream to own a Ranger!  It's funny...a few weeks ago I wanted the ice to thicken so I can get out there....now I want it GONE!"

296687,Lowe Rider,2009-01-24 17:48:00,79,"Nice toy! Gotta be bitter sweet though, can't take it for a spin for a while that's gotta hurt. Maybe you can take it up to your favourite lake and have someone tow you around on the ice LOL."
296699,Zubris21,2009-01-24 18:27:00,563,Nice purchase!  should get lots of nice bass in that beauty!
