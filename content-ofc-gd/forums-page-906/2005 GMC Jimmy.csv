It is a little computer that is located on the passenger side just in front of the door and it engages the 4x4.  For me to order a new one from GM I am looking at $1000.  I am trying to locate a used one but with no luck as of yet.  Since mine is the last year they were in production it has to be certain part number.  That part # is 12577412.  I have tried all the wreckers in the niagara region, do you guys know of other wreckers I could try or maybe another solution.  Much appreciated,  Sunny"

298572,ecmilley,2009-01-28 17:40:00,2163,how do you know it's the transfer case control module? the most common issue is the front diff actuator goes bad and thats a $135 fix plus labour
298594,rowingsunny,2009-01-28 18:33:00,11,"I brought my truck into a mechanic and he diagnosed the problem for me.  They initially thought it was just a cable that initiates the front tires and it would have been a $100 repair but when he looked into it further he found out it was the transfer case module.  Which is apparently a common problem.  I just went onto ebay and was able to find brand new one from the states for $244.00 CDN, that is cheaper than what the wreckers were charging $250 CDN but they didn't have the correct product number.  So thank you very much marty5898 your suggestion helped a whole lot!!  Now I will have 4X4 once again!!  Cheers,  Sunny"
298596,ecmilley,2009-01-28 18:45:00,2163,well the encoer motors tccm and the actuator are all very common issues with these. i have a part#12577412 tccm in my tool box as a back up  if you would like to try it out before you commit 250 bones you just have to drive to scarborough to do so
298598,rowingsunny,2009-01-28 18:54:00,11,"Thanks you very much for the offer ecmilley, I have already commited my $250 and ordered the part.  But thanks for the offer once again.  If i run into anymore more problems I will defiantly have to pick your brain.  Cheers,  Sunny"
