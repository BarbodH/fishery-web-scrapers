298543,tbayboy,2009-01-28 16:12:00,1497,"Took a snow day and while I'm ""working from home"" I happened to put on WFN and Inside Sportfishing (a show I've never seen) just started playing this 1958 fishing doc by Ted Williams about his trip to peru for black marlin.  This is probably the coolest thing I've seen on WFN and I highly recommend looking up when it plays again (knowing WFN it'll be repeated about 100 times this week).  Very cool seeing the gigantic gear and all the details they're going into.  A cool look at fishing in the old days, gonna have to dig out my Hemmingway book collection after watching this I think.  Anyhow, just thought I'd post a little recommendation to you all, commercial is over so I'm back to watching, er work, I mean work yeah  quick edit #2: link to online version (puny video but if you dont get WFN...) FishBuzzTV Ted Williams.  You can order the full 54 minute DVD from there too"
