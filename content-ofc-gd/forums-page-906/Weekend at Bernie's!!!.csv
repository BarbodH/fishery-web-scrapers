297602,ehg,2009-01-26 14:49:00,2666,Another great photo/report! Amazing craftsmanship on those boats thanks for the glimpse.
297605,Headhunter,2009-01-26 14:53:00,5703,"Well, that makes me feel better Cliff! LOL Funny though, I did not see any lemons in any of the pics! HH"
297614,ccmtcanada,2009-01-26 15:03:00,7971," Lemons were consumed...dont worry about that!! LOL.  Hey, if we are both up there next year, we should jam...I'll bring a guitar and amp along...I think it would be a blast!"
297620,wallyboss,2009-01-26 15:12:00,1095,"great report,  Now I remember why I bought a FishTrap!!!  Beauty work on the boat Bernie."
297624,tbayboy,2009-01-26 15:22:00,1497,"It's not always about the fish and you guys showed it.  Sounds like a fun, if chilly, weekend. Thanks for the great report Cliff."

297840,Bernie,2009-01-26 22:57:00,3190,Aww we missed ya Joe. But I was really happy to hear Cliff was coming along! A jam session sounds like a great idea.  Don't know why Cliff didn't mention Gerritts fishing experience off the dock though. He was casting off the dock first thing Saturday morning but got his Jumla snagged in a tree. He quit trying after that. 
297856,Joey,2009-01-26 23:20:00,9122,"Hahahaha, wonder if we passed you on the highway.  We spent the weekend at Wayne & Leah's.  Report to follow, I'm too beat now.  Great report Cliff and I know the pain you were in due to the weather.  It was brutal, but we braved it too  Joey"

298084,Headhunter,2009-01-27 13:27:00,5703,"Glad you had a blast guys... Gerritt, the lemons are for their vitamin C properties only! A jam seesion would be great...hmm, maybe I need to go out and buy an acoustic bass for camp fire jams.... sure, give me an excuse to buy yet another guitar! LOL HH"
