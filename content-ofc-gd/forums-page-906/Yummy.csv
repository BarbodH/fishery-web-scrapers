297248,misfish,2009-01-25 23:15:00,29133,"Sorry ,this is one recipe I CANNOT endulge.But I will show ya 5 pics. I learned this from a great belated chef. This guy was amazing.  So you tell me????????????????? douG, dont you dare.  This ones easy,LOL          The finished product. You all have no idea how long I have waited to cook this for two.    This was a meal made in 30 minutes and full of carbs and very healthy for ya."
297270,douG,2009-01-25 23:40:00,2693,"Brian, lookin right some jaisus fine right dere.  Is your middle name Alfred?  I recommend some baby powder for your parts later, see if the Missus can help with the application.  You will have to be strong during this."
297276,misfish,2009-01-25 23:52:00,29133," I have tears.LOL  Baby powder?   douG, except for the pasta(Iwanted fresh but hey),everything else was done from scratch. Seasons and the right sauce makes the dif. You wont taste this kinda flavor at pizza hut or boston pizza.You know,them guys that say they have pasta dishes."
297284,bigugli,2009-01-26 00:11:00,6138,"Looks mighty fine.  Not bad at all.  I usually saute the shrimps in brandy and crushed garlic before adding the cream sauce, for a different flavour ."
297295,misfish,2009-01-26 00:17:00,29133," I used a white wine. Brandy for this is a bit pushy I think. I will try that tho. What brandy would you use?  Thanks Big  Since we had the broad rice noodles last night,I went with the thin ones tonight BTW."
297314,bigugli,2009-01-26 00:32:00,6138," Use a better , clean brandy.  Some have a wicked after taste.  LCBO small cask, St Remy, are a couple that are decent. You can also go with a VS cognac."
297640,douG,2009-01-26 15:46:00,2693,"I was wondering if your post dinner romance might need some first aid afterwards, like baby powder.  It  helps with the chapping."
