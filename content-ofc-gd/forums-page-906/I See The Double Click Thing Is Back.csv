296823,Stern Rules,2009-01-24 23:39:00,342,Does anyone else find this double click thing annoying?
296826,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-24 23:42:00,3761,I only seem to need to click the mouse once . Maybe it's a problem with your internet settings. My grandparents computer has this annoying double click thing going on but once I'm back home on my laptop I have no problems
296831,lew,2009-01-24 23:51:00,12767,"Seems to depend on what skin your using. I'm  still using the Christmas skin and one click is all I need, but a couple of the others require a double click."
296837,kemper,2009-01-25 00:09:00,2232,Im one click....so that means its probably your internet settings
296853,shane,2009-01-25 00:41:00,652,One-click for me too.  I just tried all the different skins too........all one click. I'm on Firefox if that makes a difference.
296855,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-25 00:47:00,1362,double clicks for me...I'll try Lew's suggestion and go back to the Christmas skin
296856,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-25 00:49:00,1362,Interesting....seems to work fine now on the OFC Xmas Skin selector....Thanks Lew!!
296882,FISHINGNUT,2009-01-25 01:46:00,253,double click here too
296883,paul_614,2009-01-25 01:47:00,168,"Internet explorer is like that at my work, mozzila at home is fine"
296900,forrest,2009-01-25 02:36:00,1032,On the regular interface here and Firefox.  One click is good.  Try Firefox if it works single click then check your IE settings.  Clear your cache too. If you still have to double click then check your windows mouse and desktop settings.  forrest PS...I don't have windows here so I can't narrow it down for you.
296922,Leecher,2009-01-25 03:19:00,7832,Download Firefox and install it on your computer.... you'll never get the double click again Leechman
296940,Cudz,2009-01-25 03:59:00,2652,I have that double click thing as well and I hate it. How do I get the Christmas skin back on?
296963,steelhead hunter,2009-01-25 05:16:00,152,ya I got the double click also
296994,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-25 12:14:00,1362," Cudz, scroll down to the bottom of this page and you'll see 2 tabs on the left....one that says ONFCxxxx and the other which says English...  Select the arrow beside ONFCxxxx and it will open up the Skin Selector for you to choose.."
298054,Stern Rules,2009-01-27 06:54:00,342,"I switched skins and it worked. Thanks. FYI, this is the only site I have problems with for double clicks."
298142,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-27 15:59:00,10439,The other skin that works without double clicking the quote feature doesn't work.
298144,JorgeCarlos,2009-01-27 16:06:00,109,Thanks guys now works great with  ONFCchristmas
298221,gdelongchamp,2009-01-27 19:29:00,199,Gee and I thought I was the only one having this double clicking thing. I will go through my settings and report back.
298397,Cudz,2009-01-28 03:38:00,2652,Thanks just did it.  Works well and I have a festive skin as well.  Like killing 2 birds with one click of the mouse.
298405,Zubris21,2009-01-28 03:55:00,563,I second whoever suggested switching to Mozilla Firefox!  I was hesitant at first but since I did I haven't regretted it at all!  Neither will you!
298422,douG,2009-01-28 05:00:00,2693,"I think double click is a function of the skin.  Roll down to the left, at the bottom, and choose anything other than CLUB.  This seems to work for me on generously proportioned or IE, no double click on the back button.  That is funny right there. I typed F_F, and got 'generously proportioned'.  Of course, I meant F_F = FireFox.  Not you, Fudgeon Pisher, you  generously proportioned."
298425,Cudz,2009-01-28 05:16:00,2652,that is funny.  double Fs are generously proportioned.   double Ds could even be considered the same.
