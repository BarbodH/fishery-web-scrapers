I live in the east end on the Danforth, and I've seen a few people say good things about Toronto Harbour - especially Ashbridge's bay and the Rouge river march.  I tried fishing Leslie Spit last summer and it was a disaster, Carp looking at me, taunting me, but not biting.  Really I'm interested in people's set ups, gear and which fish have proven lucky for shore fishing (and maybe a couple hits on where to go!).  I have a boat, at the cottage so I'm shore fishing in TO, but I have a car.  My real fishing stomping ground is the Saugeen river and a smattering of lakes on the Bruce Peninsula + Colpoy's Bay.  I usually resort to spinners, Rapala's and Jigs.  I'm dying to get out and get a couple more like this once the season starts:    Cheers, John"
298035,hammercarp,2009-01-27 04:50:00,964,What were you using for the carp?
298038,Johnc79,2009-01-27 05:06:00,2,"I didn't know what to expect when I got there so I didn't have any bread or corn.. I'm ashamed to admit, I tried to use a chunk from a scented YUM; I know not exactly ideal but I was improvising   I've never actually gone after carp before."
298097,The Urban Fisherman,2009-01-27 14:06:00,2050,"Welcome to the board dude...I love the ""eye"" hold on those walleye! lol I know they were for the table....I knew some ""old timers"" back in the day though that used to hold pike like that and actually release the odd one...  I lived in Port Credit for a while and usually just fished the west end of the GTA, but I made my way to Humber Bay Park a few times.  There you can find Pike and Bass when they're open, and plenty of carp.  When I was new to carp fishing I just used a smallish hook, something that would hold 8 or so kernals of corn, and weighted it with a few split shots.  Worked great for me.  The only thing I do different now, is I add a slip sinker, then tie on a swivel and some leader material to the hook.  Simple and effective.  I've tried dough, and boiling my own corn with different mixtures and all that stuff and nothing has ""out-fished"" a good old 79 cent can of sweet corn. (whole kernal)  Make sure to toss out a few hand fulls to keep the fish feeding until they find your hook.  Other than that, if you do some searching I know there's been some solid reports on GTA fishing.  Cheers, UF"
298109,highdrifter,2009-01-27 14:29:00,2534,"I can't help ya with coarse fishing...  but I know a thing or two about PIKE fishing!  There's good fishing here in the harbour, provided of course the conditions are just right.  If you're willing to move around and cover some water, a whole new world of fishing opportunities awaits..  Ya sound like a reasonable duude, and most of us here are pretty keen on showing consciensous folk some spots and techniques.  We've got a great group of OFNers that fish the water quite regularly, and we all like to mix it up a little.  Shoot me a PM if ya wanna link up.  cheers HD"
