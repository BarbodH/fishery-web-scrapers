298546,fishinfool,2009-01-28 16:24:00,366,Hi All.  I am looking for a reasonably priced and good taxidermist in the Ajax area. I used to go to a lady in Oshawa named Linda Moneray who did fantastic work but she is not taking on any more work as of Jan 1 due to arthritis that is bothering her. Any info would be appreciated.  Thanks Stan

298573,fishinfool,2009-01-28 17:42:00,366, Thanks John  Any idea how competitive their pricing is or is this the only place you have dealt with?  Stan
298577,FLEX ROD,2009-01-28 17:47:00,394,"Stan,  These guys are world famous, they have set the bar as far as I know, in comparing their price I do not know as I have not been in a position to even look at having anything done in years.  I have attached the link for them, give them a call and I am sure that they will be able to give you all the info you need.  FLEX - John  What are you looking at haveing done?  http://www.advancedtaxidermy.com/"

298622,Kirk,2009-01-28 20:09:00,347,"My dad and I have a pike, musky and pickerel from Advanced, all gorgeous.  If you visit theur website and check their refernces, you will see they are endorsed by OMNR, OFAH etc etc.  Never compared them on pricing with anyone but I'm guessing they are not the cheapest, but the quality there make price irrelevant."
298628,solopaddler,2009-01-28 20:30:00,8605,"Dave Doherty in Brampton, HIGHLY recommended. This is an older number not sure if it's still good: 905-455-8122"
