280654,okumasheffield,2008-12-17 03:03:00,318,Purchased this Simms L2 wader @ Basspro in the states last Feb  have been very happy with it until what I noticed today (see attached pictures)  have heard about great simms provides and wonder if both damages are covered by warranty or not  Thanks in advance
280660,solopaddler,2008-12-17 03:09:00,8605,"Call Simms and get a warranty claim started, then mail them the waders. They'll fix them for you."
280693,okumasheffield,2008-12-17 03:52:00,318,Does anyone know how long it usually takes?
280698,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-17 03:55:00,10439,Simms gives you one free repair. This looks like you have had sand in your boots. When you get your waders back make sure that your gravel guards are propery attached. And wash your boots and booties after use.
280701,highdrifter,2008-12-17 03:56:00,2534,"Yup, just give Simms a call.  They'll send ya a tracking voucher.  And if ya don't have gravel guards, get um!  HD"
280718,okumasheffield,2008-12-17 04:16:00,318,"L2 comes with built-in gravel guard which I have always put it over my wading shoes ...  I dont think any gravel guards can prevent sands from coming in .. too small, I think but still .. hard to believe neoprene gets damaged like that ... thought it was in-destrutable ..  how long does it usually take to turn it around? really dont want to waste time during the steelheading season ... damn"
280720,KelfuN,2008-12-17 04:18:00,246,i guess no fishing for you for 2-3 weeks
280728,highdrifter,2008-12-17 04:49:00,2534," Yup, same here.  Always seem to get a bit of sand no matter how tight I have em on.  That there's just some regular wear and tear from lotsa use.  Best would be to empty any gravel as soon as you feel it, especially if you plan on walking some distance.  I've made a conscious effort to do this since I got the new pair, as I've found that even a little gravel is rough on the neopreme, and it may not be just rocks that you find stuck on the inside of your boot.  Looks like you'll need a loaner while you send em in.  I figure about 3/4 weeks from send/receive.  Which is pretty good.  But then, there's always the good ol hefty bags!!  cheers HD"
280736,okumasheffield,2008-12-17 05:25:00,318,"Speaking of loaners, does Simms provide you loaners when the repair is in process?  If so, I will buy SIMMS forever!"
280742,kemper,2008-12-17 06:02:00,2232,"my waders got a hole...I used shoe goo and put em back together. No one will ever convince me to buy $600 waders, because they are just as easy to rub with sand/gravel or snag on a wire as the cheap ones.  good luck with them, I hope they get fixed up quick"
280749,solopaddler,2008-12-17 10:39:00,8605," Dude, except for the odd trip to the Niagara steelhead season is just about over LOL! Things usually start to pick up again mid to late Feb...  If you must punish yourself buy a pair of 80 dollar neoprenes from Cabelas for winter fishing and in the meantime send in your Simms."
281222,okumasheffield,2008-12-18 20:20:00,318,Just found out I had to pay for the shipping ... thought it would be on them ...
281374,irishfield,2008-12-19 02:03:00,26272," Never have I seen a warrantee that covered the shipping to ""them"".... no matter what it was."
281522,diggyj,2008-12-19 13:58:00,548,"You should try taking them back to Bass Pro first. I bought a pair in April this year and after using them at least a dozen times early in the season, I noticed them starting to leak after I had them on while Iclosed my cottage for the seasonin November. The exchanged them for me quite easily. Usually don't have any troble at Bass Pro when it comes to any issues."
281579,kentooley,2008-12-19 16:07:00,208,I wear neoprene socks over my breathables. No wear and tear on the wader sock.  Cheers
281639,jdmls,2008-12-19 17:46:00,575,"When you do get them fixed..Start wearing a pear of socks over the neoprene , then put your boots on...You will never have wear issues on the feet again"
281778,okumasheffield,2008-12-20 00:11:00,318,thinks for the tip to wear another layer of neorprene over my stocking foot  going to try it for sure
298255,okumasheffield,2009-01-27 21:15:00,318,"Just want to let you guys know how satisfied I am with SIMMS service.  Sent in my L2 wader for the damange mentioned above on Jan 5th and got it back today, Jan 27th!  On top of that, they actually called me when they received the wader and let me know when it will be shipped back  That is what I call 'warranty'!  SIMMS rocks!"
298415,kemper,2009-01-28 04:23:00,2232,They better rock for the outrageous price of their stuff...
298420,BillM,2009-01-28 04:47:00,17367, You just need to look for the deals.  I got a pair of Riverteks for $199 at BPS.
