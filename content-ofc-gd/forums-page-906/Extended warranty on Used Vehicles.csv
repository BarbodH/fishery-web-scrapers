298204,pikehunter,2009-01-27 18:41:00,1659,"I would say no to the offer. Remember that sales people are evaluated on the amount or quantity of service plans they sell as much as or even more than on how much they sell in dollar value of actual product, the high profits are in ESP's, not on product. Instead of purchasing the plan invest a few bucks in a trustworthy mechanic to go over it with a fine tooth comb.  I bought the van I'm driving after I leased it for 4 years. They tried to talk me into an ESP when I made the ""lease end"" purchase and I declined the offer to let them gouge me for an extra $1800.00 on a vehicle that I essentially already owned and at that time already driven out of the manufacturers warranty for about 2 years. The big pitch to try to convince me was that if the tranny goes it will cost you easily over 2 g's for a new one. I told him I'd been driving it for 4 years, I know what is wrong with it and what is OK  and to stick your extended service plan up our   I have not regretted it and that was over 7 years ago...and yep, I'm still driving that very same van which now has over 300,000km's on it. Come to think of it, maybe I will spend that 18 hundred bucks I saved on not buying an ESP on some paint and touch up the body work on it this spring! After all, it will have it's 12th birthday in June!  Knock on wood that is...."
298210,tinbanger,2009-01-27 19:06:00,1028, Don't tell me that . I was trying to convince myself how smart I was LOL.  At Least I didn't take the rustproofing  TB
298244,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-27 20:48:00,10439,  If you think that's bad you should see what it costs in the little isolated villages!!!! I couldn't afford to scratch my   there!!!  Grocery Day in the Bush
298251,fishinggeek,2009-01-27 21:10:00,325,"I say no, usually.  Remember an extended warranty where you pay for it is really just an insurance policy.  For the insurer to make money, the money you pay in premiums has to be grow to more than they pay in claims.  That means they charge you a price for this based on the likelihood you'll file a claim.  So if insurance is cheap, then what you're insuring for is either very unlikely, very cheap to fix/replace, or both.  And if insurance is expensive, then a claim is either very likely, very expensive to fix/replace, or both.  The real value of the policy is it reduces the risk of a rare event, which can be important for something you can't recover from.  You'll almost always be better off putting your money that you would have paid for the warranty into your own personal wealth, like paying down debt or an rrsp contribution, on average.  But if you're better than average, (say you never drive at night, in bad weather, drive defensively), then the value of your policy goes down.  If you're worse than average, then the policy's value goes up.  If it were me, I'd see if I could recover finally from it, and how I fare with respect to the likelihood of a claim.  So if I could recover financially from a claim, say I could easily afford a replacement used car if something were to happen, then I'd never buy the insurance as I'd do better on average by using it in other ways (pay down debt, invest).  If I couldn't recover from an event, then I'd see if I was more or less likely to experience a claim than the insurance company might guess (ie. they don't know if I drive defensively, don't drive in bad weather, whatever).  If I was much less likely to have a claim than the insurance company would guess, then perhaps I'd get the insurance.  If I was more likely to have a claim, then I'd never get the insurance.  This is nothing new, and something I learned in my days learning economics.  It has to do with the fact the company doesn't have perfect information about you, and if everyone played this game (called ""adverse selection""), then everyone's insurance would go up as a result because the insurance companies wouldn't be as profitable if everyone did the ""right"" thing and played the game of adverse selection.  Personally, I never buy insurance unless the law requires it (like car insurance) or it's for an event I couldn't recover from (like home insurance).  And since I'm not self-employed, where premiums are tax deductible, it makes insurance for guys earning wages and salaries relatively more expensive.  So personally, I'd never touch that extended warranty."
298264,holdfast,2009-01-27 21:45:00,1813,"Why dont you Google, anyways read this.  NAW  http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2008...r-warranty.html"
298285,fishnsled,2009-01-27 22:40:00,3520," Now you've jinxed me.       I always like the feedback you get here.    I do Google to get as much information as I can, but the info gained here can be as good if not better in some cases.    The reason for the post was more of what others do or have done when it comes to buying an extended warranty.  Personally I'm not a fan of them as it seems most here are not as well.  Great link, you can never go wrong in checking out what Consumer Reports has to say.  Thanks for the replies everyone."
298290,Grimace,2009-01-27 22:55:00,2020,"My buddy's sister makes 150 000 a year selling extended warranties at a Chrysler dealership.    It is a gold mine.    Where does the gold come from?   Our pockets.  Keep your coin.   The car will be fine.      Chances are that between the deductable and the premiums you would be better off without it.   Lets say a transmission goes.   1500 bucks.   If your deductable is 750 and they pay 750, your premiums have already covered that other 750."
298117,fishnsled,2009-01-27 15:03:00,3520,"Just thought I 'd see how the majority feels about this.  Personally I've only done it once and is was a waste of money, imo.   Had 3 trucks since and never would have used it then as well if I had bought it.  I figured I've saved over 2G's buy not making the purchase on those trucks.  However, they're not making them like they use to,  and wonder if is worth the money or not.   The warranties range in price from $1000 for the power train - $3200 for what is almost a bumper to bumper for a 80K / 4 year plan.  Thanks for your input."

298120,johnnyb,2009-01-27 15:08:00,3413,If it's a manufacturer's warranty (as opposed to 3rd party) then I say YAH
298122,diggyj,2009-01-27 15:10:00,548,"I say yes. Probably be this time that you don't get it, and something will go wrong."
298123,Zubris21,2009-01-27 15:13:00,563,I say no way!
298129,walleyejigger,2009-01-27 15:33:00,876,"  couldn't agree more, 3rd parties have too many hoops to go thru to be valid, when u need it they deny you coverage, read the fine print of everything that's expected of you,"

298141,Uncle Buck,2009-01-27 15:57:00,1000,"i'd say do it if it's a mfg's warranty... i'd go bumper to bumper...  in all honesty, it's pretty rare to blow a motor/tranny...  lots of little electronics and crap that can go wrong, and it sure adds up quickly...  like everything though, you take a chance... look at it as peace of mind..."
298147,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-27 16:09:00,10439,"I bought a used Honda Pilot from a dealer last spring and did purchase the extended warranty it was $1500 bumper to bumper for four more years. That works out to $375 per year, $31.25 per month or $1.03 per day!!!!!! Less than a cup of coffee. When you are buying a used car you really don't know how the last owner took care of it. A buck a day is pretty cheap insurance. I have a couple of minor issues that need to be taken care of 1/ faulty air bag sensor 2/ faulty srivers side window switch. The repairs for these two little items would likely be between $500 and $1000!!! If something more serious were to break like a transmission, transfercase or differential we're talking thousands. I have heard of people paying up to $5000 for a tranny!!!! If you are buying through a dealership I would buy the warranty through them."
298148,GBW,2009-01-27 16:18:00,8460,I did extend the warranty on my car (mfg warranty) as I do a lot of KM's a year.  I've had to use it too and I consider it now paid for.
298149,BillM,2009-01-27 16:19:00,17367,"As long as it's a manufacturer warranty, and not 3rd party then yes.  3rd party warranties are garbage.  $1000 for a window switch?  Are you driving a Maserati?"
298151,Kirk,2009-01-27 16:21:00,347,"scam, its basically an addon for salesmen, did you want fries with that?  neat (and expensive) way to find out how loopholes work, adding legal jargon to mechanical technojargon plus some ambiguous words = you pay, you lose.  try reading one...or have it explained to you by someone not getting commssion on it (ie someone outside the dealership) LOL"
298152,boatman,2009-01-27 16:21:00,350,"No. Huge waste of cash. Imagine how much warrantee work has to be done to recoup the money outlaid. You'd be better off putting that money in a savings account and using it in case of a problem or putting it toward your next vehicle. Of course, if you're buying a vehicle with 300,000 km on it then go ahead and buy it."
298156,GBW,2009-01-27 16:24:00,8460,How much is it to have new struts installed on a 2006 Impreza?  My warranty was less then a grand as I knew what the cost was and didn't pay near full price.
298164,uglyfish,2009-01-27 16:54:00,981,"it can really go either way, u could get a vehicle and have the warrenty and never use it, or u may need it if somethin big happens. and same goes for gettin a vehicle and not gettin the warrenty, u may never need it and think hey, i saved a ton by not gettin it, but think if somethin does go wrong, and u gotta shell out 3 or 4 grand in repairs, u'll be sayin damn, i should have got the warrenty. i personally am glad i got it, i bought a 2002 dodge dakota, and had some minor issues and a couple bigger problems that the warrenty saved my behind on. like when they had to rebuild the transmission!"
298165,Markystang,2009-01-27 17:06:00,131,They wouldn't be selling them if they weren't making money off them. Think about it....
298169,Bernie,2009-01-27 17:15:00,3190,It's like putting money in a slot machine. Most of the time you lose. Manufacturers warranty only if you decide it's necessary.
298179,shane,2009-01-27 17:33:00,652,"If I was buying a Dodge,  I would get it."
298183,wallyboss,2009-01-27 18:00:00,1095,"Bought a used 2002 Grand Am for my wife and she wanted the Warranty.  3rd party warranty.  Good thing I did, ended up with a cracked cylinder wall.  . All and all it cost the warranty company 3,500.00 to fix it.  3 weeks later my son wrote off the car. And all he had to pay me back was the deductible."
298184,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-27 18:00:00,10439, For the two problems. The sensor is about $100 +- plus labour and the switch is like $300 + plus labour. Sensor labour 1 hour and switch labour 1.5 hours. The local labour rate up here would blow your mind. At Canadian Tire the hourly rate is $120 with the dealers being a few $$$$ more!!!!! So that bill would work out to about $700 as I'm just guessing on the parts cost. I'm pretty sure it would be more.
298185,boatman,2009-01-27 18:02:00,350," No, I'd be saying ""I'll never buy a vehicle from this manufacturer again."""
298193,tinbanger,2009-01-27 18:16:00,1028,"My 2006 Odyesee had the extended warranty ($1150 for 4 years or 130,00km)  Rear seat cable ( allows seat to fold down) failed at 90,000km Power steering pump at 129,800km !  Glad I had the warranty.  No experience with 3 rd party would be sure to read all the fine print  TB"

298201,lunkerbasshunter,2009-01-27 18:33:00,2585,i drive about 60 000km a year so a warranty doesnt last me very long so i would say no.  But if your only doing like 15k a year then go for it. Just remember change your oil every 5000km or less.  Dont mess around.  Cars should last you 10 years if taken care of.  Of course there are always lemons out there but they are lemons from the begining.  The best used cars are off lease because in most cases they are treated well and just traded in cause the lease is up not because there are issues with them.  Cheers!
