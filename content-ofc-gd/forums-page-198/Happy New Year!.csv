889811,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-02 04:01:00,8243,"Happy New Year to you big guy from the both of us as well to all the good people here at OFC.  This past year has been challenging for many of us members here. We almost lost our sister and if there is such a thing as a miracle I was witness to one. She was given last rights in April and we just spoke with her today, she had just come back from a walk with the dogs at the cottage. I told her she owes me for a new black suit I never needed to use."
