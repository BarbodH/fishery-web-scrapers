890695,BillM,2015-01-06 18:22:00,17367,I think your buddy heard wrong.  Someone here would have been in the know for sure if anything like that was coming down the pipe.
890712,Fang,2015-01-06 19:41:00,1330,"The proposed 2014 law in Minnesota is in reference to another level of training/certification on the spread of Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS). Like getting your boating license, the DNR have proposed an on-line training course that is mandatory for all those boat, canoe, kayak and float plane owners. The course is aimed at increasing public awareness to prevent the spread of AIS's and of course it'll cost you money to complete. You get a sticker to put on your boat that says your trained not to spread invasive species.  I think what has caused such an uproar is that you need the certification even if you are just travelling through the state with your boat and not stopping. It got the attention of many DNR's and also the MNR up here in Canada  I could be wrong but when I was following this, I don't think it ever passed for the AIS training and decals. Instead Minnesota slapped an AIS user surcharge of $5.00 on all boat registrations. They're good for 3 years and then you have to pay again."
