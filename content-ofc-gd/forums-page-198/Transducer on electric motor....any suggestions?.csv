I would love to put a transducer on the bow mount electric (a Minn Kota Terova) and mount another finder at the front of the boat for when I'm fishing bass or wallies.  My question is, what would be the best fish finder and transducer to mount on the electric motor?  I'd like to have down imaging and side imaging but only want one transducer.  Don't so much care about a chart plotter feature.  Thanks"
