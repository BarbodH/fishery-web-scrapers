888942,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-28 03:11:00,956,Just purchased a new Lowrance Elite 4x Ice Machine and was wondering should I let the battery drain a few times before taking out for the first time.  I heard somewhere that when you purchase a lithium battery you should drain it and recharge it a few times before heading out.  Thanks
888944,DRIFTER_016,2014-12-28 03:17:00,10439,Nope. Charge it up and go.
888950,Garnet,2014-12-28 12:32:00,2056,You should discharge it to zero occasionally. Lithium will get a memory and charge a little less until it appears to be weak. Not usually a problem  with ice fishing batteries.
888958,Canuck2fan,2014-12-28 16:01:00,1444,"Interesting read here it dispels a lot of myths that are out there.  http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries   From the study  ""Similar to a mechanical device that wears out faster with heavy use, so also does the depth of discharge (DoD) determine the cycle count. The shorter the discharge (low DoD), the longer the battery will last. If at all possible, avoid full discharges and charge the battery more often between uses. Partial discharge on Li-ion is fine; there is no memory and the battery does not need periodic full discharge cycles to prolong life, other than to calibrate the fuel gauge on a smart battery once in a while.

Another myth about not placing batteries on concrete floor. Not true Originated from long  time ago when the outer cases were made out of natural rubber, Now battery covers are made of polypropylene or othe modern meterials, battery can be stored anywhere.  http://www.trojanbattery.com/tech-support/faq/#Myths"

889030,Garnet,2014-12-29 00:25:00,2056,I check with my electronics guy. And you are correct for commercial lithium batteries. For toy battery's his words memory occasional discharge works.
889333,35Wailin,2014-12-30 21:17:00,59,"Heat is the enemy of li-ion batteries.  Short charges are better than longer ones if the battery is significantly discharged.  Once it is charged, disconnect from charger as soon as practical.  Don't leave it on the charger for days or weeks.  You aren't doing the battery or your hydro bill any favours."
