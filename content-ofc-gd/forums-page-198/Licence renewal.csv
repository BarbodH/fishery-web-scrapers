889638,captpierre,2015-01-01 01:36:00,2521,Just noticed my Outdoor Card expired today.  Thought I was supposed to have received  a renewal letter.  Anybody else in same boat ?

So they do this to hope you don't remember to renew the card and hopefully get caught without a license. One fine at a time and we will have the money for the handy reminder letters again!  Sorry for being smart  This is nothing new captpierre, 1 full year and counting with no letters being sent out. Hard to find copies of the regulations too.  MTBF"
