We did on NYE and it was awesome until the way home (our own fault). After a few drinks, we clicked the wrong button and got a ""black car"". It was a nice ride but a $35 ride turned into and $80 ride in the fancier car...The original car was from UberX and was a spotless Volkswagen sedan. I feel sorry for the cab drivers,this service is just far too good. You can even track the car as it is enroute to you and read reviews on the driver etc..."
