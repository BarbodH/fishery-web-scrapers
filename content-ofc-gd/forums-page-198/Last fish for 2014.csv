Getting on was a bit scetchy. Lots of wet spots. 15 minutes from the lake,we got a dusting of snow. The pond got 6"".  Made our way out slowly with our pics at the ready,.chipping and walking and drilling holes. Got as far as we needed to be and set up camp. Further out,we could see lots of wet spots.  One fella walking out with just a bomber jacket and jeans, found out why we stopped where we did. He went through. He got out and made his way to shore. Why people still go out dressed like that is beyond me.  Got to try out my new Mr. Buddy heater. Why I had not bought one of these a long time ago is beyond me. Hub was banked, heater on low. tunes playing and I was sitting a pool. I love it. Well not the pool part as it gets slippery in there.LOL  Water was cloudy and fish were not that active. Managed a tiny perch and a snot rocket.        Last time I looked,that angler was in a hub,not sure what happen,,,,,,,,   He sure can move fast though for an old fella.    So thats the end of 2014 for me. 2015 is only hours away and the fun will keep on going.   HAPPY NEW YEARS TO ALL AND TO YOURS.  PLAY SAFE OUT THERE "
889520,Terry,2014-12-31 18:11:00,14456,it  was great to get out guys will never learn....safety first  I was going to move  and my pop up took off across the lake  I was lucky to catch it  damn I can run fast
889524,bare foot wader,2014-12-31 18:26:00,1354,"nice job there! ice looks under 6""? at least buddy didn't become a statistic, scary stuff  my last 2014 was also a snot rocket...and I also got lazy and didn't anchor, wind came out of nowhere but managed to grab on during ""lift off""  dropped/kicked my rod down the hole but recovered it pretty quickly in shallow water"
889529,Acountdeleted,2014-12-31 18:36:00,2562,Beauty pike there Brian. Great way to end 2014.
889539,Moosebunk,2014-12-31 19:03:00,3970,"Was fun watching your fishing exploits through 2014 Brian.  You got yourself out there a tonne and really mixed it up with your tribbin, icefishin', float tubin' and boatin'.  With the Lowrance and Buddy Heater we're one in the same now.  Best to ya in 2015 dood!"
889580,misfish,2014-12-31 21:08:00,29133,"Ice was 3.6""-4"" at best. We walk and know the lake, so we are pretty comfortable when we head out,also know our limits.   Drew,we will never be one of the same. Im too old to catch up to you.   All the best guys"
