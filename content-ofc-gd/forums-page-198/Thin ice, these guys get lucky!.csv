889746,Joey,2015-01-01 20:21:00,9122,"Wow, very lucky indeed!!!"
889748,fishindevil,2015-01-01 20:31:00,6254,Yes they made it to an island they were very lucky !!!  Like my post says from 2 days ago !!!  IF YOU DONT  KNOW DONT GO !!!  Glad they all made it out ok and were rescued .... I'm afraid there will be more incidents as this latest cold snap has given a false sense of security !!! It's supposed to get quite cold so it's helping a lot but still pretty dicey in lots of areas .... Be safe everyone.   Cheers & happy new year
