I got the chance to fish 2 days, back to back, in the same spots, first day, (Tuesday) got out with my day and 2nd time (Wednesday) with a few buds. First day we got our rainbow limits and 1 whitie (no fish finder) lost a few more though as well as a laker. The 2nd time, we each got our limits of bows and decided to go and try for whites, we knew it would be cold but we decided to bear through the snowstorm and set up the huts, in about an hour, everything was ready to go and we had around 2 hours to fish before it would be time to go. I instantly began to get some hits and soon enough the fish-finder was lit up with fish off bottom. Within a half hour, my first white was on the ice and 2nd rod was receiving hits. Shortly after I had my 2nd whitie on the ice and had a hit as soon as I dropped my bait down again but missed it. Everyone was getting hits but it was very hard to set the hook on them. One of the guys had a big whitie on and lost it right under the whole which was very disappointing but it is what it is. Shortly after, we began to set up and left for home. All in all a great 2 days on the water and hopefully i'll get out again one last time before next week! pics of the first day:[/url                                 and the 2nd day:[/url[/url"
