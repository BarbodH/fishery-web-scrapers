890049,adam lancia,2015-01-03 20:25:00,234,Thank you for the clarification Bill. Looks like my spring fishing is going to be for trout of some kind :-D
890051,Steve,2015-01-03 20:28:00,2075,"pike and walleye open in may (for most regions).  prior to that, (jan/feb/march/april) you'll be dealing with trout.  just be careful, trout season in MANY locations is not open until ""trout opener"".  read those regs."
