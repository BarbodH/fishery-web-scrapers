Very hard to walk in it, and it got warm and sticky very fast. IS THIS NORMAL for a nylon waders?  Never tried it on colder water temp on rivers yet. Nothing wrong with the waders, and in excellent and clean shape. No holes either.  "
890310,ccmtcanada,2015-01-05 00:21:00,7971,The weight of the water will compress the material against your body so that is normal.  Even moreso of a feeling standing in a river with a current.  Cool/cold water will alleviate that sweltering feeling for sure.  What you felt is completely normal.
