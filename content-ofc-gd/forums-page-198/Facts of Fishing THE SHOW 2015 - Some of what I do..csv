890700,bigbuck,2015-01-06 18:41:00,2449,Awesome video and great camera and editing work!!! Mercer is a great guy. I spent a good hour talking to him a couple years ago at the fishing show and he handed me a stack of subway cards for my girls who charmed his socks off. He is having fun living his dream. Good for you guys. You have a fan here!!
889850,The Urban Fisherman,2015-01-02 16:54:00,2050,"Hey Gang! Some of the newer folks around here may not know me as my life has changed quite a bit since I started with OFC.  Back before my oldest was born, nearly a decade ago, I was online constantly.  Since then a lot has changed, 3 kids, several moves and 2 houses later I find myself a little overwhelmed and unable to get on here as much as I'd like!  That said, I will always be thankful for the fishing advice, friends and in large part my current job that I acquired by meeting Dave through OFC.Every year I work with a solid group of guys, who together work hard to bring the best quality of production that we can to Facts of Fishing and I'd like to share a little teaser here if you haven't already seen it!  Season 8 starts airing this weekend on Sportsnet 360 Saturday and Sunday morning at 8:00 a.m. EST time!  Hope you like it and thanks for the ongoing support!!!  Cheers, Ryan   FACTS OF FISHING 2015 - COMING SOON! from Facts of Fishing on Vimeo. "

889883,misfish,2015-01-02 19:26:00,29133,"Ryan that was a sweet video. Last time I seen Dave, was up here for the kids fishing day. He let my little Lilly sit on the boat. He looked great.

Keep up the good work  We film 13 episodes per season so if you catch it every week that'll be a new episode every week for a little over 3 months.....which is typical of pretty well any show out there.  Maybe you have a fishing show watching addiction? )"

I run the ""A"" cam along with a handful of GoPro's on the the boat with Dave and I'm also the lead editor on the show.  That said, it's a huge group effort with ideas, the slow motion filming, aerials and support with editing as well."

I'll dream of catching  them you can dream about catching bass...deal?    I just find bass fishing shows about as exciting as watching paint dry or grass grow Ryan!!!
889953,MCTFisher9120,2015-01-03 01:58:00,3761,"Still haven't met ya in person Ryan but thanks for sharing that. You do a amazing job and I still remember the first time Facts Of Fishing THE SHOW hit the air. It was different than anything else, and look at the success now. You have brought cool camera work into the fishing show world.  Can't wait to see what's filmed next year!"
889996,grizzlybri,2015-01-03 14:20:00,565,"Great video, woke up to late to see the episode this morning, hopefully I'll catch it tomorrow. I'm one of Dave's/the show's twitter followers and always enjoy the tweets"
890003,manjo39,2015-01-03 15:08:00,354,"Hi Ryan,  a thought that dawned on my while watching last season, was that Facts of Fishing has the best cinematography of any fishing show.  Its not even close. Really evident in that clip.  Loved the back cast of the spinner bait right at the camera!  Is that what you do for the show?"
890061,msp,2015-01-03 21:18:00,1336,"Well done Ryan. You definitely have the passion for your fishing and family. Keep up the good work. One request though......... Can you please give my number to April Vokey, thanks I will be waiting by the phone"
890376,motv8tr,2015-01-05 12:10:00,2587,"Great clip Ryan, thanks for sharing it with us, but I didn't see one shot of Dave kissing the fish...  Maureen"
890384,asdve23rveavwa,2015-01-05 13:55:00,2690,Not bad
890385,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-05 14:01:00,8243,"Very nice stuff there. Dave Mercer sure has lost quite a bit of weight. I haven't seen one of his shows for years. Any credence to the rumor his sponsorship from Subway was in jeopardy because of his weight? Regardless he's as trim as a noodle rod now and good for him. Someone said "" Hey I hear Dave Mercer lost 100 pounds"" other guy replies "" Yea that's like throwing a deck chair off the Queen Mary to lighten the load "".  You have some great skills on that camera and a great eye. Keep up the good work."
890413,danbouck,2015-01-05 17:38:00,4380,Terrible video
