890185,SirCranksalot,2015-01-04 16:54:00,3291,I've seen snow and I've seen rain. I've seen sunny days I thought would never end..................
890195,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-04 17:34:00,10439,-36 windchill tonight. OW!!   Up here that is pretty much every day between December & March!!! Suck it up buttercup!!!!
890205,Joey,2015-01-04 18:31:00,9122,"Just walked the dog, what a sloppy mess. It's all melting though, which is a bad sign for the lakes and ice fishing"
890209,mike rousseau,2015-01-04 18:37:00,4661,Usually 1-2 days of warm weather are good for ice forming long term...  Melts the snow then gets cold and freezes any water on top of the ice...  Then with no snow ice can form faster cause there's no isulation now...  Only issue I've seen are some ice holes opening up from the runoff...
890211,Joey,2015-01-04 18:43:00,9122,Well I hope you're right.  I've ice fished Simcoe New Years day so this is a bad sign as far as I'm concerned.
890212,Beans,2015-01-04 18:57:00,3339,"Tomorrow's going to be a mess.. and trying to get to Toronto General Monday am doesn't look like to much fun!  Wayne...I hope you are claiming travel expenses on your income tax along with meal allowances, parking and accommodation...  I just finished doing mine for 2014... "
890214,OhioFisherman,2015-01-04 19:04:00,6623,"It's been raining here al day. I can't remember getting this much rain this time of year. It's 55F as I type which is extremely warm and the warmest it's been all day  This basically, it was in the 50's yesterday and pouring rain, it's 40 out now, and a high of 17 predicted for tomorrow."
890220,irishfield,2015-01-04 19:55:00,26272,"I can't claim it Norm.. but yes I do put it all on Jen's return. Should be a 9 meal allowance per day for the 3 of us.... not just hers, but it is what it is and we continue to move forward.. and go broke..  Now calling for 15 to 20 cm tonight and another 15 tomorrow. She might be cabbing it for pre-op and we'll have to catch up to her when we arrive.  I started plowing here at 11am.. just finished a few minutes ago to get rid of the wet mashed mess. Mid way through plowing it turned into a blizzard and dropped another 2"", but has stopped.. hopefully for at least the day. Son's problem after tomorrow... lol"
890064,misfish,2015-01-03 21:35:00,29133,"We have had snow now for the past 3 hours.The heavy stuff. Lots of water in it. Next comes the freezing rain then just rain. +8 for the high Sunday.    Whats happening where you are?  If this is what  this winter is going to be like,lust leave it at fall,and go to spring then summer mother nature.  "
890066,grizzlybri,2015-01-03 21:43:00,565,I'm in the Halton Hills and i was snowed for about 5 or 6 hours hear. It stopped about an hour ago. We are expecting similar weather overnight and into tomorrow
890068,ketchenany,2015-01-03 21:58:00,3229,"Snowed here in Woody, stopped now."
890069,lew,2015-01-03 22:11:00,12766,Been snowing here in the Kawarthas for a few hours but we've only got an inch or 2 then sposed to go above freezing tonight and turn to rain.  I have to leave here tomorrow morning at 8:30 to drive to Brampton so hopefully there's not too much of a mess.
890071,ccmtcanada,2015-01-03 22:15:00,7971,Down here in Whitby is changing over to rain now. Got maybe 3 cm of snow.  Will be gone tomorrow with temps rising to 11c and 15mm of rain!
890076,adempsey,2015-01-03 22:44:00,1498,"Raining most of the day here in London, ON.    Sleet in the morning/early afternoon and changed to rain.  A real mess outside.  I just ""shoveled"" [more like pushed the slush] my driveway though because I have no idea what to expect, and hate having that layer of ice below the snow when you shovel."
890080,Joeytier,2015-01-03 23:07:00,3990,"-8 and snow all day, staying that way all night and then -6 and more snow tomorrow!  Yeehaw"
890081,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-03 23:30:00,10439,-28 with -36 windchill here. We have plenty of ice and a good snow base for sledding.
890083,irishfield,2015-01-03 23:51:00,26272,Snow.. snow and more snow Brian. Plowed well over a foot yesterday afternoon... and we have about 7 inches of new stuff in the yard now that has dropped since noon. Waiting to see if we get any freezing rain as it's easier to leave the snow.. let it rain.. and then plow it. Tomorrow's going to be a mess.. and trying to get to Toronto General Monday am doesn't look like to much fun!
890084,bigugli,2015-01-03 23:53:00,6138,"Light snow in the morning. Freezing rain since 1pm.  This weather is just a little too reminiscent of the crap we used to see during a Nova Scotia winter. A good blow would give you 1-2' of snow from the north, then the wind would shift bringing warm air from the gulf current, and that brought freezing rain and rain, followed by another dip and more snow. Was normal to be stranded 2-3 days along the eastern shore. They lifted my uncle by chopper to get him out on the Bonnie the one time."
890085,Terry,2015-01-03 23:58:00,14456,freezing rain is here
890089,lew,2015-01-04 00:21:00,12766,They lifted my uncle by chopper to get him out on the Bonnie the one time.  I spent alot of time working alongside the Bonnie Bruce.  
890090,bigugli,2015-01-04 00:30:00,6138,"  That was an age ago now. I still remember when they beached my uncle. All his skills and qualifications were deemed worthless in the civilian world. Despite the fact that when the weather got really nasty, civil aviation would need his help to talk the planes in."
890093,lew,2015-01-04 00:56:00,12766,  civil aviation would need his help to talk the planes in.  Watching those Trackers take off & land on Bonnies flight deck was something I never tired of.  Very repetitious but the skill of those Air Wing pilots landing those planes on the small deck in rough seas was just unbelievable.
890096,bigugli,2015-01-04 01:05:00,6138,  And they used to have to do it blind at night and in heavy fog. There would be some nasty prangs on deck at times.
890098,Whopper,2015-01-04 01:07:00,2174,It's been raining here al day. I can't remember getting this much rain this time of year. It's 55F as I type which is extremely warm and the warmest it's been all day
890144,misfish,2015-01-04 10:02:00,29133,"Thats a great picture Lew.  Looks like were done here with the storm. Clean up has begun and the main road outside looks nice and clear. Guess I,ll go fishing for a bit. Maybe catch one or two, of those open season herring."
890145,lew,2015-01-04 10:35:00,12766,"Temps were sposed to rise to +5 here over night but it didn't happen & it's still  below freezing and now their saying it's only going to +1 later today. Still got freezing rain coming down and there's a 1/4"" of ice covering everything. Cold temps coming tonight and staying for awhile so I guess the ice coating will be here for awhile too.  I've got about 250 miles to drive today so I sure hope the salt trucks have been working on the roads."
890146,ketchenany,2015-01-04 11:03:00,3229,"Plus 1 here Lew, going up to 2 with rain, you should be fine coming out this way."
890147,lew,2015-01-04 11:26:00,12766,"Plus 1 here Lew, going up to 2 with rain, you should be fine coming out this way.  Thanks for the update bud, appreciate it.  99% of the time I don't worry about weather but long drives on icy roads can definitely be a nuisance."
890148,Rich Clemens,2015-01-04 12:07:00,3131,Little ice and freezing rain yesterday am - then switched to all rain.  More rain today then the temps start dropping.  Possibly below zero for us later in the week.    At least this rain ain't snow.
890149,manitoubass2,2015-01-04 12:13:00,11391,"finally got a good 10-12"" of the white stuff then boom, -45 hahaha. wth?  gonna be a b!(#$ to shovel today  very windy out too We even brought the huskies in last night"
890155,Joeytier,2015-01-04 14:11:00,3990,-36 windchill tonight.  OW!!
890157,Fisherman,2015-01-04 14:29:00,7201,Still raing/freezing rain here.
890177,irishfield,2015-01-04 16:00:00,26272,"Looks like the warmth off the lake saved us here. The freezing rain, on all radar I've watched, made it as close as the concession road just one over closer to town than us. Guess I'd better get out there and plow the potato snow!"
