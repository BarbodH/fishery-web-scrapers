889046,ccmtcanada,2014-12-29 01:40:00,7971,I got the Elite 7 HDI as well. (No x).  I can't wait to try it out!!
889068,moxie,2014-12-29 13:20:00,1566,I have fished from a boat that had one mounted on the bow. The DI feature adds more clarity in regards to the structure you are viewing. Enjoy.
889070,2 tone z71,2014-12-29 14:06:00,1311,Thanks Fellas ..I'm sending it back today ..I'm trading it for the 7 gold combo ..I want the Gps
889071,huddy,2014-12-29 14:31:00,16,I've had one for about a year and a half and it works really well !! I am setting mine up on snowmobile to use the navionics charts for ice fishing.
889130,porkpie,2014-12-29 17:56:00,2521,Good choice!
889165,ccmtcanada,2014-12-29 19:51:00,7971,I Have the gold combo.  With a screen that big gps is a must!  I'd do the same!
889498,janesy,2014-12-31 16:48:00,22,"I have the X model and I am thrilled with it. I do have a separate unit with GPS so it is not an issue for me.  HOWEVER...the Gold option is the way I would go if I did it again. Simply for the SD card slot. With the X model, you are not able to update anything. Basically what you buy now is what you have for ever. Had I known that, I'd have gotten a GPS model"
889552,2 tone z71,2014-12-31 19:36:00,1311,Yes at first I was pretty impressed by her choice ..but after a few days my needs kicked in ..and we sent it back for the gold combo ..it only makes sense
