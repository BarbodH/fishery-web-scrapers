886342,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-13 04:25:00,8243,I see Homeless Despot has heated outerwear now that runs on a Dewalt cordless battery. Do they have heated boots too?
889349,Freshtrax,2014-12-30 22:41:00,2215,Was trying to find some titans could not find a size 12 anywhere.   I ended up with a pair of  cofra thermics.  They are on sale at tsc right now for 119.  Marked down from 229.  I needed a new pair for my trip this weekend I will let ya know how I like them.
889350,misfish,2014-12-30 22:47:00,29133,Royal dist had them. Lots of them for $109.
889362,ecmilley,2014-12-31 00:32:00,2163,Picked up a pair of broadstones at can tire for $60 good to -59 just winter truck driving boots but they are ultralight and waterproof flexible to drive in Used them other weekend to march into a trout lake ice fishing feet stayed warm and dry has a liner like the omniheat stuff. Nice to find somethingn that works well without breaking the bank
889377,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-31 02:52:00,8243,"Some said earlier always buy boots one size larger, I could not agree more. Good blood circulation is very, very important. A trick a hogger ( train engineer) told me to never wear socks with ribs in them.  If you can see the ribs or anything that leaves an imprint on your legs or feet you will have cold feet. Turn the socks inside out and always have the smooth side against your skin.  Has worked well for me for many years. The built in steel toe and steel metatarsals we used to wear were not conducive to warm feet so every trick helped.  I think I have a line on Bunny Boots near Rochester, I hope."
889412,ckrb2007,2014-12-31 06:30:00,449,Another vote for the Baffins.
889481,Shloim,2014-12-31 16:10:00,515,"Theres a guy on the show"" mountain men"" that wears those white boots. So they must be solid boots. I have a pair of sorel skagway boots that I bought for work they are green patch but, they've been awesome and never let me down. They are even too warm for me many days...."
889904,Steve Piggott,2015-01-02 21:10:00,196,Baffins Made in Canada in Stoney Creek . Buy Canadian .Who else but a Canadian can make a warm boot.
886121,Freshtrax,2014-12-12 03:25:00,2215,Discuss.  Work gave me a 100. Dollar cap.  No need for steel toe.
886122,DRIFTER_016,2014-12-12 03:44:00,10439,If you can find them here the White Bunny Boots from Bata are the warmest boots I have ever worn. They are a little heavy but I don't think you'll find a warmer boot. These are the Arctic boots the US military use.      Keeps my tootsies toasty @ -30 while sitting in my hut ice fishing. I got mine for about $50 US while I was in the states. Lots to be found on Amazon.com and ebay though.
886132,Joeytier,2014-12-12 04:13:00,3990,Baffin -100's are far and away the warmest and 100% boot i've ever owned.  I can wall around in -35 and deep slush all day and still be bone dry and toasty warm!  Heavy as hell though!  I wouldnt go snowshoeing with them but great snowmobile boots
886133,adempsey,2014-12-12 04:14:00,1498,"I like my Baffin Titans a lot.   You can get them on sale for $100 I am sure.  I am really liking those White Bunny Boots though, very cool.    Might have to check those out myself!"
886134,DRIFTER_016,2014-12-12 04:20:00,10439,What's really nice about them is if they get wet inside you just wipe them out with a rag. There is no felt to get soaked or dry out between uses as it's sandwiched between the outer and inner layers of rubber. My buddy who came to visit from BC in 2010 wore his bare foot in -20 temps and was comfortable. I wear a poly liner and a wool sock and have been toasty at -45.
886135,irishfield,2014-12-12 04:21:00,26272,"Are yours the ""Mickey Mouse"" Dave... or the full -70 deals?"
886136,DRIFTER_016,2014-12-12 05:02:00,10439,"Are yours the ""Mickey Mouse"" Dave... or the full -70 deals?  I have both. The black ones are Mickeys and the white are the bunnys. Blacks are -20F and whites are the -70 boots."
886137,irishfield,2014-12-12 05:12:00,26272,Finding that they actually come in both colours as Mickey Mouse now.. and why I asked... so be careful shopping ebay based on $ value.
886147,trevy727,2014-12-12 11:50:00,351,Another vote for Baffin Titans here. Best boots I've ever owned for sledding or ice fishing. Wouldn't want to go for a long hike in them though.
886161,Sinker,2014-12-12 14:06:00,8692,"Yeah, hard to beat the titans in that price range. They are warm. Love mine.  S."
886162,jimmer,2014-12-12 14:09:00,2730,Baffin Titans all the way. Never get wet feet in them either.
886173,ch312,2014-12-12 14:43:00,1590,"Asking ""what are the best boots in the $100 range"" is as broad of a question as asking ""what lure works best in the $10 range"". There are far too many variables to consider.  Will you be doing a lot of walking or sitting in one place? Weight is a huge factor while walking so boots for this will be lighter and provide less insulation as you'll be moving more while boots designed for sitting in one spot tend to be heavier as the lower activity level requires greater insulation.  Will you be using them in just the snow or might you encounter mud as well? The rubber boot style are better for mud and water as they're easier to clean and will always be 100% waterproof where as the typical winter pack boot style is best suited for mainly snow use and can develop leaks at the seams over time.  Are you typically rough on your footwear or do you tend to take it easy? There are many different types of materials out there with some providing increased flexibility and lower durability while others are less flexible but will last forever.     Your boots are likely the most important part of the puzzle when staying warm AND comfortable. Do yourself a favor and buy quality boots that best suit your individual needs."
886198,myot,2014-12-12 17:42:00,131,Try Nats they are by far the lightest boot around. I use them for both hunting and icefishing and never have a problem with cold feet  Dan
886218,tender52,2014-12-12 19:29:00,270,Baffin's 100%
886238,misfish,2014-12-12 21:52:00,29133,Another vote for the Baffin Titians. This will be my forth season with them and there is no wear or cracking. Best winter boot I have owned. No worries of getting wet feet. I wear a pair of light wool socks and thats it. Dosent matter if Im out side fishing or in the hub.My feet are toasty warm.  One piece of advise. Dont wear them while driving to your fishing spot. Your feet will sweat.  I seen them at Cabelas for $109.
886241,Joeytier,2014-12-12 21:56:00,3990,"Yep, never wear your boots until you arrive at your destination!"
886246,chris.brock,2014-12-12 22:10:00,4053," My company has the same safety shoe program. If I go over $100, I can pay the difference. They only accept receipts from certain stores though.  I like my Baffin Titans. I have 3 pairs. My wife has a pair too"
886247,fishindevil,2014-12-12 22:26:00,6254,The Baffin boots are the best by far !!!! I have had a pair for years and they are toasty
886258,Weeds,2014-12-12 23:36:00,782,"I bought a pair of Baffin Titans after reading a similar thread to this last year. Mine leaked by the end of the first season. I was bummed, probably should've tried returning them.  Out of the box they were great though, very warm but also LARGE. Go a size bigger than you would normally wear."
886271,Freshtrax,2014-12-13 00:26:00,2215,Looks time the titans it is. Thanks guys your the best.   I'm replacing some 5 year old ckx tiaga ultralights.   They were awesome boots but wore out quickly for the price.
886272,muskymatt,2014-12-13 00:28:00,2608,Columbia Bugaboot Plus II Omni-Heat Winter Boot
886289,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-13 01:13:00,8243,"The Kamiks I just bought sure are toasty but those white Bata US military are the best I have ever borrowed when my feet nearly froze in my $150.00 Sorrels ice fishing.  Can't find them around Hamilton. Bata shoes had a Hamilton factory in the 80's I think, now I can't find any, any leads folks? I would love a pair."
886292,DRIFTER_016,2014-12-13 01:22:00,10439,Check with Amazon.com and US military surplus stores. Maybe you can get a set in Barfalo.
886326,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-13 03:39:00,8243,"Thanks, going down to western NY Sunday to see family, will check beforehand. Those are great boots, might have to buy more than a few pair, I know I can flog them here for sure."
886328,manitoubass2,2014-12-13 03:47:00,11391,"I wear my firefighting boots most the time lol  a pair of good socks and move around abit if needed  i carry those heater pack things in my lowrance case but I dont recall using them for my feet. they work well on my hands though:)  im pretty active on the ice though so I dont get cold often. I wear a monkey suit or my helly hanson gear and im usually in a sweatshirt right away, even in -30"
