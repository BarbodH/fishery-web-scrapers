889982,c10,2015-01-03 05:40:00,131,"Not sure what you mean since those 2 towns are about 2 hours away from each other, but NB has had good ice for almost 3 weeks on most lakes, just not much snow.  lol, I meant two separate trips, one to each one of my friends, that could have been specified more legibly, my bad!... It was a rather poorly worded sentence, but come-on I know they are not particularly close to each other lol I know N.B has safe ice now, but it was during the middle of the warm spell here in the south - I know hut operators are reporting 4""+ of ice on Nipissing, I suppose my worry came from whether that was going to stay that way or not"
