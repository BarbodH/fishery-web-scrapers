890128,reelinrolly,2015-01-04 03:17:00,281,"Just wondering how many guys out there are running with an Otter Monster box on their ATVS  I was wondering how you like them, and also wondering if they would fit a 2015 450 Can-Am.  Im looking at options, and just wanted to see if anyone on here has one.  Thanks"

Ended up buying an all checker plate aluminum box made for ATVs of all places, Home Depot. I found most of the other types were just too floppy or the wrong dimension for what I wanted.   http://www.homedepot.ca/product/32-inch-atv-storage-box-aluminum/997124  Sent you a PM too."
