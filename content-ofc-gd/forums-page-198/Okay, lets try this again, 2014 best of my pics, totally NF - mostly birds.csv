884946,Beavertail,2014-12-05 19:22:00,331,"Holy crap Joey, thanks. Those are great photos. That last one of the Coopers is amazing - love the red eyes and plumage on the adults...even has his under-tail coverts all fluffed up! He looks fired up, must have been the breeding season! Those pictures belong in a bird identification book, serious."

Those pictures belong in a bird identification book, serious.  Wow, thanks Beavertail, I do try my best to get good pics.  I'm a very patient person and also a seeker, so I try to go find them.   I think I've done not too bad in the last few years.  Those baby ones, with them learning to fly, I've got a ton of those, it was so cool to see.  The nest was so far up though, it was hard to get get pics of them, but I'd drive by every day and if there was a good wind, they'd try to fly, it was so neat to watch"

889515,Fisherpete,2014-12-31 17:49:00,1814,"Great pics Joey - really like the snowy Owl ones. Even for fishing pics, I find it hard to just bring out a point and shoot anymore - started using the wife's Nikon J1 this year (which is by no means in the same ballpark as any of your cameras, but...) and the pics are so much better."
889543,Moosebunk,2014-12-31 19:08:00,3970,I was away when you first posted this Joey.  Nice to take a look now.  Some absolute gems in that lot.  Enjoy snapping away in 2015.

The new digitals for much less surpass it's quality and capabilities for sure, amazing.  Great art Joey.  Wow, that's so cool!  $3,500, jeez, that was a bit of money back in 72' eh!  The canon lense I have now was $1,400, on sale.  I think it is normally $2,000 or more, so when the sale came, Paul said to go get it at Henry's and it was one of the best decisions we both made.   Being in the boat all the time I see alot of birds, but then my passion took me to other places, ponds around my area, parks etc. and I just go and look all the time.  I'll drive an hour and a half just to see if I can find a kestrel or a snowy owl.   So many places to find these beautiful birds/animals.  Have definitely enjoyed buying that lense and would recommend it to anyone interested in photography.  Thanks so much again everyone for the kind words"

884794,Joey,2014-12-04 23:44:00,9122,"Joey, YES you are. I haven't done any since my Pentax SLR went and film went out the door! I do have a camera collection and some of the old ones I got to work when film was available! My best is a 1904 bellows camera! I also have one made out of wood and it works too. But no film.  Gosh, made out of wood, that's cool, do you have a pic of it?"
884796,Joey,2014-12-04 23:51:00,9122,"Fantastic pics there Joey.  Is the last one a Snowy Owl?  Yes, it is a snowy owl.  Every time we went ice fishing on Simcoe, we drove up the 400 and I could see them at the Holland Marsh, but of course you can't stop on the highway with a truck and trailer, so I went back one Sunday on my own in my car and just travelled down each road of the marsh looking, then found one.  I even went back the next week and found another.  Here was the first one I found, but I didn't get him in flight.

884630,Beavertail,2014-12-04 00:06:00,331,Really cool pictures...I especially like the action shots of the Heron nailing the panfish and the Coyote pouncing on a rodent. You must spend quite a bit of time outdoors with your camera waiting for just the right moment to present itself.

Thank you, actually, if I'm not on vaca, I take the camera in the car with me and go to fields and marsh areas etc and stop on my way to and from work and just cruise slowly to see if I can find anything.  It actually takes alot of work to find good wildlife pics.  I don't just happen upon them, I scope out where they live, drive by every day and wait ""patiently"" for them to show up.    Appreciate all the responses though and hope I can take some more next year for you all to enjoy"

Always digital, any film?  Right now I have 3 cameras, but my fave is the Canon 60D with the 100-400mm zoom lense.  The T3i is okay, not as good as the 60D.   The other one is is just an old point and shoot.  If I wanted to get a new camera, it would be the Canon 7D.    But the lense is the mainframe, you need a zoom if you want good pics, so save your money and pay for the lense and get a T2i or T3i."
