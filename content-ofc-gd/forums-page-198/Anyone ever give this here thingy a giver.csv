889788,Moosebunk,2015-01-02 00:32:00,3970,"Arrived at Christmas.  Called the Teardrop made by 13 Fishing.  Upside-down baitcaster is what it is. GearR - 6.2:1, 8BB's.  Threw it on a M-H 36"" St.Croix and spooled it up with 100 yards of 15lb braid. It's small though, light, with line capacity for more.  With lure attached it'll balance perfect.  Thinking it'll be for big lakers, maybe big eyes or pike too.  Even if it's garbage it still looks purdy cool.  Anyone use it before and have an opinion?  "
889808,John Bacon,2015-01-02 03:36:00,3277,Interesting; I have never seen one.  But I do have a closed faced spinning reel that mounts under the rod.  I think that would be hard to thumb the spool on a cast; it should be okay for ice fishing though.
889810,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-02 03:48:00,8243,"Turn it over, it's left hand retrieve right side up. With the specs it should be a nice reel. Sure is nice looking."
889840,tender52,2015-01-02 15:55:00,270,Not like that. but I do have a OLD baitcaster on my jigging rod.
889846,Christopheraaron,2015-01-02 16:32:00,3525,"Turn it over, it's left hand retrieve right side up. With the specs it should be a nice reel. Sure is nice looking. Nope, these reels are actually meant to be put under the rod for some reason, kind of an odd design. Let us know how it goes Drew!"
889849,dave524,2015-01-02 16:50:00,4508,"Even though I wind baitcasters and other top mounted reels with my right , I wind anything that is slung under the rod with my left, I would  prefer the handle on the other side even though it is a baitcaster.  Another thing it would be hard to thumb the spool if you are lowering on freespool."
889851,davey buoy,2015-01-02 16:56:00,5505,Same as you Dave on the cranking on top or underneath.Looks like a two hander casting. Will be interesting to see how it performs. We'll be waiting for your report Drew!!!!!!  .
889870,bare foot wader,2015-01-02 18:07:00,1354,newer version of the black betty it looks like (which I like/don't like lol)...if it still free spools with a lightweight lure it would be a good reel  but for deep water lakers I'd still stick to my c3 on a baitcast ice rod  cool look design though
889887,Moosebunk,2015-01-02 19:55:00,3970,"This here quick video better explains it than I can...  Looking forward to giving it a whirl with the lakers or eyes, hopefully soon.    Will let ya's know what I think."
889888,misfish,2015-01-02 19:56:00,29133,"I like.  Look forward to your review on it Drew.  Then long stem does pose a concern though. Snapping/easy breaking, is my concern.  Dang,just as I post, you put the video up."
889889,BillM,2015-01-02 19:58:00,17367,"I'd probably use that in a heated hut, but I don't think it's going to be much fun out in the cold trying to get your lure down 100+ feet for lakers with frozen line"
889891,misfish,2015-01-02 20:05:00,29133,"Ok,I asked.  BTW Drew,can you find out where it was bought?"
889892,Moosebunk,2015-01-02 20:11:00,3970,Agree with that Bill as it would be the case with any baitcaster used outside below freezing...  Will see how it does outside though... Anytime fishing lakers there will always be at least two other sticks with spinning reels ready to go.  Brian... it seems pretty solid... and from the spool to the first guide is pretty well a perfect straight shot.  It's no bigger than a 750 series reel or so... but with nearly doubly the line capacity and a rather heavy drag if need be.  I can't wait to sink a big spoon into a heavy laker and test this things gears.  It was ordered right from 13 Fishing.  And no... I'm not Prostaff of them or anything.
889893,Terry,2015-01-02 20:19:00,14456,"yeah it would freeze up easy I saw them a while back but don't want a rightie but if they made it left hand , I would  buy one"
889895,Moosebunk,2015-01-02 20:23:00,3970,"yeah it would freeze up easy I saw them a while back but don't want a rightie but if they made it left hand , I would  buy one  They make 'em left and right Terry."
889896,aplumma,2015-01-02 20:26:00,6896,Looks like it is either a love it or hate it set up. It appears to be clunky from other reels you use but it also has a few desirable features as well. Once you use it I am sure you will decide on the first trip out.   Art
889897,misfish,2015-01-02 20:28:00,29133, They make 'em left and right Terry.  Ya in the vid I seen that. You have the right and the guy was showing the left.
889898,Terry,2015-01-02 20:32:00,14456, They make 'em left and right Terry. well dang the 2 online stores I looked at a few months ago only had right hand so I figured thats all there was will look again  thanks
889899,Moosebunk,2015-01-02 20:35:00,3970,"Looks like it is either a love it or hate it set up. It appears to be clunky from other reels you use but it also has a few desirable features as well. Once you use it I am sure you will decide on the first trip out.  Will pull no punches, use it in the hut mostly, and give it to ya straight by the end of the season.  Will tell ya though so far Art, it's not actually ""clunky"".. it sits nice in the palm for pencil grip and seems decently built."
889911,irishfield,2015-01-02 22:22:00,26272,Laker Jessy used a bait caster.. out in the cold.. -20C and put us ALL to shame one cold and nasty February day.. lol   
889946,Moosebunk,2015-01-03 01:36:00,3970,"As you know, they can work fine Wayne for sure  Piking, had one rod with a C3 on it in the past, even a Zebco spin reel, and they never had issues.  Wasn't jigging deep lakes tho."
889950,irishfield,2015-01-03 01:56:00,26272,"She was in the 140 foot hole, at the Brooms, in that spot..."
889956,Moosebunk,2015-01-03 02:00:00,3970,"On my spinning reels, there goes that 50 or so yards of braid when those 20lb'ers hit the lure from down there. lol."
