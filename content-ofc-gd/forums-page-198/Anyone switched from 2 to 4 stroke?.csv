889416,Mister G,2014-12-31 10:08:00,1429,Have to add that there's a healthy difference in price too.  I got a 40 Yamaha last fall for about $2K less than the Honda. And a E-Tec is at least another $1K LESS..........so more money to buy other toys for fishing.
889424,2 tone z71,2014-12-31 13:03:00,1311,I'd paddle my Yamaha before I bought another E Tec
889435,porkpie,2014-12-31 13:42:00,2521,"I don't own an Etec, and I don't know that I'd buy one, but I do fish out of a boat that wears an Etec and for an unbiased opinion, I believe it to be about as quiet as any 4 stroke. I also know it uses very little oil, and isn't too hard on fuel. Saying all that I'd still buy a 4 stroke for my next motor.  I'm not quite sure why your so angry about the whole Etec thing, I guess you had a bad experience?"
889450,Steve,2014-12-31 14:37:00,2075,"did you buy your ETEC after seeing their super quality late night infomercial?  I know that's the mark of quality.  A good late night infomercial.  Add a gimmick like a ""self winterizing"" feature that lemmings can flock to.  Add a few more guides that'll use anything that someone will give them a free hat to use.  And what do you got?  An ETEC!!!!  Are they a good motor? Certainly, especially after the FICHT disaster (I'm not sure what was worse, the FICHT disaster, or the disaster that is Tracker Boats).  I know I use the slap chop my wife bought on a daily basis. Just look at those nutz."
889453,2 tone z71,2014-12-31 14:49:00,1311,All the E tec is is a glorified Ficht..I bought a new in the box 115 in 08 biggest Pos ever..there's twin 200 ho on the one work boat..and a 150 on the other ..and a 250 on the bosses brothers boat ..on it's third power head ..so ya speak from a lil experience ..I had plugs go in less than 80 hrs ..then the engine would not shut off with key or tether..sensor went 18 miles off shore ...trim unit caught fire ..could go on....the local marina only sells evinrude and he's got 3 full time mechanics..and just what kind of two stroke SIPS oil uses no oil ..what do you figure provides lube..it's the lifeline of the engine ..says all the E tec power heads in cardboard boxes under benches.

889848,cram,2015-01-02 16:48:00,1733,"I researched this to death before getting mine (an etec 115).  My impression was that BRP had a big issue with the larger motors (150 and above) in their first few years.  They apparently rectified it on new releases.  I went with etec for a bunch of reasons, but one of them main ones was nearby access to a dealer.  If a Suzuki dealer was nearby I would have gone with that.  Same with Yamaha."

887343,porkpie,2014-12-17 18:28:00,2521,"I have a buddy with an Etec, they use hardly any oil.  That said, I bought my 2 stroke based around my duck hunting.  Most guys I've talked to with the 4 stroke version of my motor cannot maintain the same top speed with a heavy load in the boat.  Why I don't know! Next time I repower though, it will likely be 4 stroke!"

The 4 stroke is nice, but ya can't beat 2 stroke power......They both have their pros and cons.  That said, my next engine will be the 4 stroke.  I also duck hunt tons, and with a load aboard the boat, you can't beat the 2 strokes. The 4 strokes are dogs out of the hole. My boat with a 40 2 stroke will blow away my buds with a 40 4 stroke out of the hole, and on plane, by miles.

887371,Bernie,2014-12-17 21:04:00,3190,"Been running an early version 175HP E-tec called a Ficht since 2001. It's better on fuel than the 130 Honda it replaced by a substantial margin.Regular 2 strokes mix the oil and fuel and air in the engines crankcase. It gets there when a vacuum is created on the pistons upward movement through the carburetor. When the piston is moving downward it compresses the fuel/oil/air mix and pushes it up a chamber outside the cylinder wall that leads to a port on the cylinder where it then enters the combustion chamber above the piston. This action also pushes the spent/burned fuel and air out the exhaust port on the other side of the cylinder wall.  On a direct injected 2 stroke like the E-Tec, the fuel (gasoline) is injected directly into the cylinder above the piston using specially designed injectors. The air still enters the way it did before.This allows oil to be injected below the piston to lubricate the moving parts. Because the fuel isn't washing the oil out of the crankcase it stays in there for a long period. Only the air flow itself carries the oil along sparingly. (*NOTE* This is also why it's important to properly fog a 2 stroke rather than just shoot oil into the spark plug hole when going into storage.) Probably use around 8 to 10 liters of oil through each season. A four stroke I'd have to change the oil halfway through season.  I have found the engine to have been very good over the years. Never has failed to bring me back and has always started very well. It gets run close to everyday in open water season because I commuted to work each day.It's an early model so it is a noisy thing in comparison to today's engines. But I'd still consider getting another one to replace it when the time comes."

It is super quiet, very smooth and easy on gas.  I can get about 28 MPH by myself in smooth water .... about 22-24 with three guys and gear.  That is WOT.  I generally run around 15-18 mph which feels like a nice cruising speed.  My set up is from the mid to late 90s .... I'd imagine the newer fuel injected 4 strokes are even nicer.

I tallied it up and I figure I've saved over 1000$ in maintenance already. My first servicing on the etec only cost me $80.

The motor has been taken care of and it will troll all day long with no trouble. The problem is with the age of the motor. In the spring of 2013 the push button on the starter would not work and I tried everywhere to find a new one with no luck. Johnson does not have a replacement and it seems no one else does either. I am thinking that some other parts will not be available sooner than later. The other thing that always bothered me was that this motor does not have a charging system to refill the battries. It used to bother me that some times I had to charge the battries before I could take it out. The last trip there was not a good one that ended with someone hitting my truck in a parking lot and leaving. I was not a happy camper and I took it out on the boat. I brought it home and parked it, covered it, but did not change the oil in the lower end.  I am considering getting a 4 stroke Merc in the spring. Some one mentioned that the the 4 stroke is not as strong as a 2 stroke. What they said was it would take 50 hp 4 stroke to equal the 40 hp 2 stroke. My concern is not the speed but the how the boat will handle.  So has anyone switched a motor like that?

If it weren't for duck hunting season and having to haul hundreds of extra pounds in the boat , I would've gone with the 4 for sure.  If my boat was in excellent shape, and I had the cash then I would for sure upgrade from an 80's motor.  The reliability factor was the major reason I sold my old outboard and bought new.  I didn't want my 20 odd year old motor deciding to pack it in on me in cold November weather far from the launch.  It was still reliable, but you never know!

I didn't see any reduction in power, if anything (because of the power trim) I gained a couple mph top end. The hole shot was maybe a little less; because a 4 stroke cannot pick up its rpm as fast as a 2 stroke. The Honda used maybe a 3rd less fuel and no more head shaking, smoke belching 2 stroke noise. Not sure how true this is; but the salesman at Honda told me that the older motor's horsepower were rated at the crankshaft of the engine. New(er) motors the Horsepower is rated at the prop; after the hp loss of going through the gearing. So the engine hp might actually be something like 45?

Haven't sat beside a Yamy to compare but I'm sure they are quieter, I may even consider a Yamy as my next motor. You have to let a 4 stroke warm up a little longer than a 2, They are a little gutless on bottom end but make up in not having to buy oil for mix and to suffer the fumes. I'd jump up 10 HP on a 4 stroke if your running a 2 stroke. Just my opinion."

887296,John Bacon,2014-12-17 14:54:00,3277,"When I had my 16' starcraft it originally had a 40 Suzuki 2 stroke on it. The oil injection went south on it and I didn't want to have too start mixing gas, so I bought a new (2004) 40 Honda 4 stroke. I didn't see any reduction in power, if anything (because of the power trim) I gained a couple mph top end. The hole shot was maybe a little less; because a 4 stroke cannot pick up its rpm as fast as a 2 stroke. The Honda used maybe a 3rd less fuel and no more head shaking, smoke belching 2 stroke noise. Not sure how true this is; but the salesman at Honda told me that the older motor's horsepower were rated at the crankshaft of the engine. New(er) motors the Horsepower is rated at the prop; after the hp loss of going through the gearing. So the engine hp might actually be something like 45? After using the Honda there's no way I would go back to a 2 stroke. Sooner or later we'll likely follow California where 2 strokes are no longer sold new.  Dan.  Yes, that is true about the change from from crank shaft to prop shaft rating for horsepower.  I think that happened sometimes in the late eighties.  My brother had a 60hp 2 cylinder Johnson that he bought in the mid eighties.  His model became the 50hp after the switch; and the new prop rated 60hp was a 3 cylinder.  As far as banning 2 strokes.  I don't think that traditional two strokes are sold anymore.  Direct injection 2 strokes (E-Tec & Optimax) are still sold; but they are supposedly just as clean burning as four strokes."
887299,Mister G,2014-12-17 14:59:00,1429,I stand corrected.  Dan. I thought the same as you until I did the research.......hard to believe but true from all the reports.

887309,John,2014-12-17 15:28:00,2956,"I have a Evinrude E-TEC and it's a HUGE improvement over my older 2 stroke even though it's still  a 2 stroke engine.  The new E-TEC are beating out the 4 strokes in power, quietness, economy and MAINTENANCE.....and not to mention initial coast.  When I was going to up grade I thought I would only get a  new 4 stroke until I did the research. Saved over 1k and got a 5 year warranty plus no maintenance whatsoever for the first 3 years.  They are also the CLEANEST outboard engines in the industry. So much better for the environment.  VERY HAPPY I went E-TEC  Yep but you are still burning gallons of oil.....$$. Have you factored that into the equation?"
887310,bigbuck,2014-12-17 15:30:00,2449,"If you can find a deal on a used 4 stroke it could be worth your while, otherwise you could upgrade to a newer used boat with a 4 stroke hanging off the back. Repowering is expensive and you have to weigh it out as to whether it is worth it or not. As for parts, there are a couple of boneyards out there for boats. Might be worth checking out. There is one place in Honey Harbour, he has tons of bits and pieces. The name escapes me though."
887315,Fisherman,2014-12-17 15:47:00,7201,"Going with a 4 stroke is pretty much a no brainer, as for Etec, you see any other modes of transportation sporting 2 jokes.  Even a number of the modern snowmobiles are going that route."
887317,John Bacon,2014-12-17 15:49:00,3277, Yep but you are still burning gallons of oil.....$$. Have you factored that into the equation?  You still go through oil with a four stroke.  You are just changing it instead of burning it.  Most people change the oil at least once a year in a four stroke.  That could end up being just as expensive as two stroke oil if you have low mileage on your boat.
887323,Cosmos,2014-12-17 15:59:00,588, You still go through oil with a four stroke.  You are just changing it instead of burning it.

I used 2 l of amsoil since I got my motor. was fishing almost every weekend from May to October with 4 camping 4 days trips.
887325,Mister G,2014-12-17 16:05:00,1429," Yep but you are still burning gallons of oil.....$$. Have you factored that into the equation? Yes but less, much less then 1 gallon a year and it beats changing the oil. Not to mention brand new 4 strokers demand other maintenance on them from the dealer.  Also the OP was concerned about a good charging system if I remember correctly. Well the E-TEC has the best in the industry for keeping that  main batter charged. It boast 81 amps of total output / 25 amps Net Dedicated compared to only 17 amps from most 4 strokers."

I change mine twice a year and 5W30 Quackerstate is cheap, allot cheaper than good 2 stroke oil. Marina told me change the filter every secound change."
887334,DRIFTER_016,2014-12-17 17:06:00,10439,I went form a '91 Merc 90hp 2 stroke to a 2013 Merc 115hp 4 stroke in the spring of '13. The heavier 4 stroke on my boat required me relocating my TM batteries forward to help weight distribution but was not a big deal. I would do it again in a heartbeat the new 4 stroke is a beautiful engine. I upsized so I could make sure I had the same kind of performance as I had with the 2 stroke. It worked well and actually gets up on plane even faster than the old engine did. I thought that would be impossible as it got on plane in a boat length with the old motor. Now it's almost instant.  Your prop choice has more to do with hole shot and top end than the type of motor IMHO. I went to a Merc 4 blade aluminium prop and it really helped with my hole shot over a 3 blade aluminum. I didn't lose any top end by going to it either which is a bonus.  If I were you I would go with the 50hp if you are upgrading just to be safe.
