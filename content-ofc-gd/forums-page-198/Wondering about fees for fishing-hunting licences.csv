I tried to suggest that was for the plastic card but he thinks it's an extra charge that the store is pocketing. I didn't think places could charge a ""fee"" for licences. Anyway not a big deal, just wondering what the thoughts were.  And yes, I did also mention the new extra fee that was discussed here a month ago or so."
889576,davey buoy,2014-12-31 20:45:00,5505,"No extra fee here a week ago,$31.72 I believe just for a yearly renewal.Could of been a buck more."
889585,MCTFisher9120,2014-12-31 21:26:00,3761,"Yes guys there is now a $2.24 service fee that is added onto any license or card issued through those computes. The 1yr Sport is 29 something, + $2.25 now. If you needed a new card the ""Service Fee"" would be $4.48 added onto the total.  This is the new deal on licensing this year. 1year Small game went up a buck. Conservation 1yr is 16 something, the sport is 29 something now so it went up a dollar also.   MTBF"
889591,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-31 22:06:00,8243,"It stinks but I know there are good sport fishermen here that would pay $100.00  if need be.  From people I have spoken to in the US and Europe our 30 beans is cheap compared to some permits. I have never heard of a retailer charging their own service fee but can understand it.  For some the other 60 plus year olds here a question, or others that know, I'm 60 now and figure all I have to show is something with my birth date on it. I don't want to carry around my Passport, drivers licence or Birth Certificate because I know 100% I'll lose them. Will a coloured copy suffice?"
889595,kickingfrog,2014-12-31 22:12:00,8333,You've got 5 years to figure it out.
889598,gaspumper,2014-12-31 22:20:00,393,"Need to be 65 to not need a license, but in 2016 we have to buy a outdoor card and fishing license"
889602,kickingfrog,2014-12-31 22:30:00,8333,My own research tells me that the $6 was: $2 for card. $2 for fishing licence. $2 for hunting licence. Plus HST.  He still thinks that the store charged him $6 bucks for the privilege. Some people just won't listen.
889622,Bill Shearer,2014-12-31 23:40:00,456,"Presently I don't need a fishing license, cause I have attained the 'over 65' factor. But, I pay for licenses in a few states, and another province. Believe me what Ontario charges is more than fair. I only fished one day in Ontario, in 2014!"
889627,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-01 00:09:00,8243,"I was told 60 for no license. Oh well, maybe time to get a Disability Parking Permit. Only kidding, we must watch what we wish for mustn't we. I've had the application sitting in a drawer for 10 years because I can use the exercise. More than happy to pay just like everyone else."
