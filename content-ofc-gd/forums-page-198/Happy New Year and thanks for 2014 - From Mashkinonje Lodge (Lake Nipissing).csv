We had the privilege of meeting, catering and making friends with many of you this year and look forward to continuing this in 2015.  Our lodge sort of became an unofficial OFC headquarters this past year, and boy are we glad to have you, so thanks! We already can't wait to kick things off this spring, and are busy preparing and making upgrades that we know you'll all appreciate (cottage reno's, docks, boats, new store, etc, etc.). Many of you have already booked with us and we thankyou.  If you haven't been to Mashkinonje yet, we'd like to personally invite you join us for this upcoming year. Much Thanks, Regan"

889600,aplumma,2014-12-31 22:25:00,6896,A Happy New Year to you and Goldie and the family. My trip up North last year was a pleasure and my next on this July will be spent at your fine place as well. Both the accommodations and the friendship you all shared made the 13 hours of travel one way worth it.   Art and Joe

Great spending time with you guys last year and Diane and I are looking forward to being up there again in June. Thanks Lew, you're the godfather of Muskie fishing up here and I learned ALLOT from you during our time fishing together.  More importantly, I had loads of fun fishing with you and hanging out with you and Diane at the Lodge.  PS - I haven't forgotten about our expedition to the far west arm (Cross Lake).  We'll pack a lunch and make a day of it in June."

Art and Joe Thanks Art and Joe,  We drove 5 hours to visit family for christmas this year and nearly lost our hair, so can't even imagine how you make the 13 hour journey each year.  Glad we make it worth your while, and will continue to do so with some surprises in 2015."

Looking forward to it Regan, infact I've been thinking about it alot since John & I took a cruise up there for a look-see last summer and I think I may have found a couple good looking spots."

We are now just under 6 months away from another visit.    Sure hope they don't put us to work stacking wood again this year.  LOL.   All our best for 2015.
