890467,misfish,2015-01-05 22:26:00,29133,Tragic for sure and I feel for the family.  However given a choice I'd rather go out that way then hooked up to machines lying in a hospital bed waiting for them to pull the plug on me.  Not saying his choice was wise...just saying I'd rather spend my last day doing something I loved.  AMEN
890486,Big Cliff,2015-01-05 23:32:00,6899,"I drove by Scugog last week and there was plenty of ice (or at least it looked like it). However, there were several spots out in the middle of the lake where there was open water in patches.  One of the reasons Scucog is so dangerous is because of the springs in the lake, there can be 6"" of ice all over the area but suddenly there is a patch (could be 4' or 40') where there is only a 1/2"" of ice.  None of us go fishing thinking we will risk our lives but many of us do. I can't count the times I have seen guys fishing out here in a thunder storm, graphite rods, an aluminum boat, lightning..... fortunatly most of us get away with it! Saddly this fisherman didn't!"
890494,bigugli,2015-01-05 23:47:00,6138,"Every year, during early and late ice, we get the same result from a few fishermen or sledders.  Even if you do go out on early and late ice, there are a few safety measures we can all follow. Float suits, picks, spud, or staff."
890496,craigdritchie,2015-01-05 23:49:00,1586,"I feel badly for this guy's family ... really do .... but it was only a matter of time till a story like this appeared in the paper. It's cold today, but it was above freezing for most of last week and through most of the weekend. How thick did he really think the ice was?  I'm amazed that people will happily risk their life for a couple of perch and some weiner-sized walleyes. You know, fish you generally wouldn't even bother with in open water.  I guess I will just never get ice fishing."
890507,davey buoy,2015-01-06 00:06:00,5505,"Never understood the rush out,this Sat will be good for me,if I see tracks,and I will auger a few holes as well.As long as this deep freeze stays till the weekend as thought.Very sad for a older fellow as said,should of known better.Be safe everyone!!!!"
890511,FloatnFly,2015-01-06 00:11:00,1640,"wonder if the township will charge his family for the recovery.....   but seriously, way to early for scugog, it was open at christmas time, or barely skimmed over"
890516,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-06 00:39:00,8243,"Last month a fellow member posted some pics of him on ice with open water mere feet from him. I said I thought the edge of the ice looked like a few inches not 5 or whatever he said and he blasted me for what reason I do not know. I still think that anyone fishing on ice near open water is nuts. That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it. All waters are not the same. I know it can be touch and go on a river because of currents and here on Erie where water levels change I have bored a hole and found the water 4"" below the ice. That's not good either I think."
890520,chris.brock,2015-01-06 01:00:00,4053,"Erring on the side of caution is the best way to go, no doubt Ironmaker, the pictures look dicey but I think Selfmade was on slightly older ice adjacent to newer ice, not open water. I enjoy both your guys input here, JMHO  Sad story on Scugog, I don't like to hear stuff like that, hopefully we learn from it"
890314,ketchenany,2015-01-05 00:52:00,3229,"A 61-year-old man is dead after falling through the ice on Lake Scugog, near Port Perry.  Durham police say the man was returning from ice fishing when he fell through the ice.  A dive team was called to the scene to help pull the man from the water.  Police are reminding people to be aware of the changing weather conditions and that no ice is safe ice."

890320,grizzlybri,2015-01-05 01:08:00,565,Last week I was planing on going out on another lake today with Jeremy84 but we decided to call it off because of the weather. But more important to avoid the risk of the ice not being ready  I was out on Scugog once about 10 years ago and the only reason i felt safe enough to go out was because the hut were out on the ice
890323,ketchenany,2015-01-05 01:20:00,3229,"they are all the same. Thin ice is thin ice, in some places it MAY be safe. Please be careful out there. I did it for many years on Simcoe and  sometimes the attraction is overwhelming and we take risks."
890325,Acountdeleted,2015-01-05 01:23:00,2562,Man...... I feel bad but for a big body of water like that with rivers flowing into it I feel like it's waaaay too soon. Such a shame this had to happen.
890326,Sinker,2015-01-05 01:29:00,8692,Scugog takes a few lives every winter. Spud as you go....every step....or end up like this poor soul.  S.
890339,ecmilley,2015-01-05 02:05:00,2163,Use your spud going out and coming in
890342,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-05 02:18:00,4399,Or do the smart thing and stay off until the ice is ready....I will never understand ice fishermen and their need to get out in less than ideal and often quite dangerous conditions!!!

890421,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-05 18:15:00,8243,When we ice fished as often as possible we always had spikes in each pocket or fastened to a long piece of twine wrapped through to each arm of your coat. Like Moms puts on kids so they won't loose their mittens. A buddy went through in the spring on Quinte and he held onto the edge of the ice with a spike until he could be pulled out.
890426,Acountdeleted,2015-01-05 18:25:00,2562,"When I was in College we did a day of 'Ice safety' up around Gravenhurst. We had on dry suits and practiced getting out of the ice using picks, bars and nothing.  A few of us mentioned to our prof 'This is all well and good, but if we go in it's not going to be with a dry suit on' so after a bit of persuasion and complete supervision he agreed to let us jump in with just our clothes on and with zero assistance.  When it was my turn, as soon as I hit the water, I felt the energy drain from my entire body, like I had just finished a 2 hour workout at the gym. Even keeping my head afloat was difficult. I kept trying to kick and beach myself up on the ice but to no avail. Finally, I saw a chunk of ice that had frozen on top of the other ice at the edge of the hole we had made. I was able to grab it like a rock climbing grip, and roll myself onto the ice.  Needless to say, after seeing how tough saving yourself can be, I'll never go on the ice without a float coat."

890446,Sinker,2015-01-05 20:28:00,8692,"That section of lake is known to be a dangerous area too. The guy had a cottage on the lake, and fished a lot.  He knew better, took the chance for the first ice bite, and lost. I feel for his family. I bet they had no idea what he was doing.  S."
