889434,Garnet,2014-12-31 13:38:00,2056,I saved 5 guys on Deerrock Lake 35 years ago. Lot of beer bottles and liquor around and a 14ft boat.  Offered a ride to a fool that thought he could swim across Rice lake on the eastside of tracks. On my way back couple hrs later I got him off the center marker buoys.

889477,Shloim,2014-12-31 15:59:00,515,"This is an odd one. A couple of years ago while on lake Wilcox I found a whole bunch of Indian/ Hindu type plastic deities. They looked newer so my son and I fished them out and disposed of them. Im guessing they were part of some ritual. Ritual or not they were pollution in my books, and have no business in a lake! After that we started what would become a tradition for us and remove a piece of garbage every time we go out. Well almost every time....."
889499,KLINKER,2014-12-31 16:53:00,256,"I came across a deer a few miles out in LO. , I was going to call it in for boat traffic to be aware of it but figured some idiot would want to rescue it and it was better off on it's own.  A guy swimming across West Lake had a lot more faith in all the boats out there than I did so I escorted him across. He was some %$ off cause he went from showing off to looking like an idiot.  A half sunken tinner  in the middle of the night, glad to see it was wrapped in police tape.  BALLOONS  When I started fishing LO. I was always picking up balloons. I heard of a guy getting one in the outdrive and cost him the motor."
889516,Acountdeleted,2014-12-31 17:56:00,2562,We find tons of those in the streams and creeks around the GTA. I'm pretty sure you are correct. They are part of a ritual.

Ya know, I respect everyone  and as I said before, I'm the product of immigrant parents so, very tolerant to all people.

Thought nothing of it. further downstream started finding full beer cans of Coors light.4 in total I think. Made me wonder if a canoe had tipped but saw nothing else.

I've found many lures, but two years ago found a cool leather jacket and sunglasses that I'm sure weren't cheap.  Have you guys found anything cool while fishing?"

Lost mine about two weeks later. I think he's caught at least 15 musky on that thing and it's still his go to bait. Another friend snagged a dead guy on Pittock something I always dread finding.

We went on to our destination and went fishing, then reported it to the RCMP when we got back to town. The desk SGT started giving me grief for waiting so long to report it. I told him it was burnt and the fire was out. It wasn't going anywhere and wasn't a danger to the woods. I said there was no way I was giving up a day fishing to go back to town to report it. I also said with the attitude I was getting you can bet yer a$$ I won't bother to make a report if I come across another crime. He changed his tune after my tirade and all was good."

When the cops came they confirmed that it had, indeed, been used to comit a crime and then was dumped there.  Good thing it was jammed with sand when I was toying around with it."

889285,lew,2014-12-30 10:26:00,12766,Years ago my grandparents owned a water front home up in the n/w corner of Simcoe. I was fishing out in front of the house one day back in 1961 and found a wallet floating in the water and inside was $37 cash along with all the usual stuff. The owner lived in Toronto so I called him to tell him I'd found his wallet. He was obviously happy and asked if I could mail it back to him and for me to keep $7 for myself.  Doesn't sound like much now but 53 years ago $7 was a big wad of loot to a kid.  Like everyone else who spends time on the water I've found lots of other things floating around but that wallet is something I've always remembered.

889293,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2014-12-30 14:32:00,535,"Last May when the water was really cold and it was very windy I was fishing for pike and walleye when I saw a canoe in the middle of the lake, thought to myself I'd never be crazy enough to canoe in those waves when the water was this cold. I was driving past and noticed nobody was in it, figured it blew loose off somebody's dock. Went over to see and noticed rods, a cooler of beer and a radio still going inside, plus a life jacket, but nobody inside. Went looking in the direction it was blowing from and after a few minutes found a guy's face poking up out of the waves, boy was he happy to see me! He was so cold he could barely talk and I had to pretty much carry him back to his house where his wife promptly gave him crap. No life jacket, wearing jeans, boots and a sweater, he probably only had a few minutes left before he was going under for good. That was my best find. Didn't catch anything that day but I didn't mind, that was enough action for me.  I've also found rods, clothing, a boat ladder, lures, etc...while trolling for lakers."

889305,Acountdeleted,2014-12-30 17:57:00,2562,We fished a woman out of the inner harbour in Toronto in mid February. Thankfully she was still alive and she made it. She was just very cold.  She told us she was trying to swim to Rochester to see family.  We learned later from the police that she had escaped from her 'place of care' and that they were looking for her.

889320,lew,2014-12-30 18:54:00,12766,My brother used to be a volunteer fireman and they got called out one night when someone heard screaming coming from the ice on Scugog.  Ed & 3 others drove to the shore then carrying an extension ladder and any other gear they needed started walking across the thin ice towards the screams. The ice was cracking around them as they walked but they kept going until  they reached the spot where the guys went through. One man was already dead and the other not far from it but they got him out and into shore where an ambulance was waiting.  He was taken to hospital where luckily he survived.
889321,manitoubass2,2014-12-30 18:56:00,11391,"so alot of us have seen dead bodies or helped in a rescue.  thats disturbing  we rescued two people that anchored a bassboat in the rapids, gnarly experience how fast things happened.  second was a guy that swam the rapids. OPP and local anglers all helped in the search. my neighbor found him 4 days later and like many said, ill never forget it"
