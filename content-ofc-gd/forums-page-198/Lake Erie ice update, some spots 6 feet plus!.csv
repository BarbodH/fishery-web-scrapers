The 70KPH winds kicked up 5 foot breakers that are hammering the shoreline creating huge ice walls as I type this actually. So I really am not lying, the ice is 6 feet deep or more.  Long Point Bay will have a good covering if the wind and cold keeps up. As long as we don't see the 9C temps they are calling for Sunday here Fish Farmer will be a happy boy soon."
