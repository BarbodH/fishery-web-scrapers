890418,ckrb2007,2015-01-05 18:11:00,449,I ordered my new 3 yr Outdoors card/license online on Dec 23rd at 11pm and just received the card in the mail today. That's only 13 days total which includes 3 stat holidays and 4 weekend days. I'm impressed! I guess I won't need to cart around the piece of paper for months on end after all.  Colin

890422,Raf,2015-01-05 18:21:00,3495,"my card expired this year too.  i want to get a new 3 year card and a 3 year license.   in the old days, the card had a spot on the back where the license was imprinted (for lack of a better word). i want to avoid having multiple pieces of paper for each season, etc.   i want one plastic card with the 3 year license branded on it.  do i go through the website or go to a license issuer to do that."
890423,bigugli,2015-01-05 18:21:00,6138,The kids paid for theirs on the 20th.  Nada so far.

890427,Canuck2fan,2015-01-05 18:26:00,1444,What he said.... The website is the fastest and you do get the card with the 3yr license on it. And if you have printer you just print out the temp license and you can go fishing right away.
890429,Raf,2015-01-05 18:28:00,3495,Do you get a temp license for use until the real deal comes in?
890430,BillM,2015-01-05 18:29:00,17367,"Do you get a temp license for use until the real deal comes in?  Yup, you print it off via the site after you've ordered your card."
890431,Raf,2015-01-05 18:29:00,3495,Thank yous!
