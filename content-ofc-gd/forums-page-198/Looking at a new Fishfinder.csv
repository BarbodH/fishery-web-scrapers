889407,Paudash,2014-12-31 04:54:00,273,It looks like the new Humminbird Helix 5 has finally be released in Canada and for the price it looks awesome.  The only real down fall looks to be that it is not net-workable but for me that is not an issue. Anyone looked at these or know anything about them.  For under $600.00 fully loaded I just do not see anything close.

I don't know what the quality of SI will be like, but I know their down imaging is pretty good in the $5-600 range.  I've had a bird for 3 years now and have been pretty impressed.  Make sure you post something next year once you've has a chance to run it for a bit!"

I think the will be great budget friendly units.  So far there are 11 pages of comments but I think you may find a lot of the info you are looking for...   Not being able to link is important to some but not the people who are looking at spending this much money. I wouldn't mind buying 2 or 3 of them and I could care less if they linked up.  http://www.bbcboards.net/humminbird-sonar-gps/524029-new-humminbird-standalone-helix-5-units-announced.html

890375,jeffw,2015-01-05 10:14:00,267,Basspro and radioworld have them i'm going to pickup one this spring.
890440,Hooked,2015-01-05 19:38:00,891,Yeah I'm gonna pick one up as well this spring.  I checked them out and appears the best bang for the buck.
