890591,FloatnFly,2015-01-06 03:58:00,1640,"Thought we were in trouble in the 2nd, great game, should of been some more penalties in the 1st against Russia, but oh well.  Undefeated in the Olympics, undefeated in the Juniors, total domination!"
890598,Mr.Topwater!,2015-01-06 05:47:00,81,I think we took 4 straight penalties in the 2nd. The boys held on in a beauty game. Everything is now as it should be
890620,Fang,2015-01-06 13:33:00,1330,"I left to pick up my son from baseball training when it was 2-1 Canada. It's was only a 10 minute drive. get back and it was 5-4. What a drive. Had my 1972 Team Canada jersey on, waving my arms out the window when Canada scored. Had 4 or 5 cars honking their horns with me at a red light when Canada went up 5-1. It was a very different drive back home!!!!"
