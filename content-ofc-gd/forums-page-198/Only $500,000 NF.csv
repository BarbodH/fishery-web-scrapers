890156,206,2015-01-04 14:17:00,563,"for a Ford? No thanks lol, plus the size of that it isn't making it into many back lakes up here lol  looks nice tho"
890165,tender52,2015-01-04 15:01:00,270,Nope. Wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.

890197,mike rousseau,2015-01-04 17:48:00,4661,Or you get a used truck... Lift it... Big wheels... And used truck top camper...  And come in at 1/10-1/20 of the cost....  That price is rediculous... It doesn't make any sense...

I agree though, half mill is a bit much. They start down around 200 if I recall correctly. And they aren't factory Ford that's for sure. With all that said, I don't see much use for anything like that in the Canadian environment. Maybe for the guys in the southern states that off road in the desert for weeks on end. Who knows."
