The second last renewal was a wee bit stressful, though. I ordered it a week before my notice came in the mail, because someone mentioned on here mentioned you could. So I am waiting and waiting, it finally showed up on the 31st about an hour before I was leaving for a 3 day ice fishing trip.  Of course I hadn't bothered to print anything out from the website when I ordered it, because I had always gotten it before the 22nd in other years. Or course I never had a trip planned those times.  I did save the webpage though as a .jpg which I am sure wasn't going to be legal, so just happy I didn't have to use it. LOL"
