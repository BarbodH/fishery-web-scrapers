888680,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-26 16:34:00,956,"I know that I wish to catch a PB for every species every year, but that's just dreaming.  My goal for 2015 is to catch a walleye through the ice and to catch a pike in the grand river.  Maybe catching a carp that's bigger then my PB(33"").  Nailing a nice size catfish at Dunnville would be cool too, but this year I haven't had much luck.  What about you guys?"
888683,porkpie,2014-12-26 16:48:00,2521,To spend even more time with my kids in the boat!
888685,moxie,2014-12-26 17:11:00,1566,"Not really a goal but more of a wish. To win the lottery, flip ""work"" the proverbial bird and spend enough time on the water with my kids and friends so my wife is left with no other option but to find herself a boyfriend  .  I got the business end of the wishbone at dinner last night so lets see what happens."
888693,bigugli,2014-12-26 18:20:00,6138,"I have two very important goals. Every year, there is the goal to fish 10 new bodies of water. The better goal is to get out and go fishing with as many OFC members as I can this year."
