Watch for the city of boats and fish close to them, they will be over the schools of whitefish. You can also use live minnows on a spreader, but let it sit on bottom for a count of three to five, then lift gently, if you feel the fish, set the hook with a short set, not too hard as you will rip the hook out. Sometimes this works better than the spoons or jigs. Hope this helps. Keith"
