My son and I were all set up by 5:20am, my brother and dad were 15 yards away set up in there blind. It started to come light out and no birds were gobbling yet, so we gave a few soft calls and we hear them about 100yrds away. At 6:30 they decide to fly down out of their roost and come over to take a peak, I lured them in with my slate call the last 60yrds. They get to 20yrds and I put the call down get the gun and take aim, I shot first and dropped him then my dad shoots and drops his bird. By 7am it was all said and done, another successful turkey hunt for the family and our first double header. Most of the birds around by us were locked up with hens so we all decided to take what ever legal birds came with in our shooting range. 2 jakes is what we ended up getting, so meat for the freezer and no tag soup. Here is the pic of my son and I with the turkey. "
