338392,doubleheader,2009-05-05 14:27:00,497,"Hi Lew, just in case you aren't aware of this potential problem I thought I'd mention it here since you mentioned you plan to troll alot with your new 150 Yammie. Four strokes need to be broke in properly and then run hard when new to set the rings properly. I trolled alot with my Verado when it was new (after break-in) and I experienced the problem of ""making oil"". It's not uncommon. Check this out. It's an older thread but you'll get the idea. Just in case you weren't aware.  Beautiful rig- good luck  http://continuouswave.com/ubb/Forum4/HTML/001503.html  This is a better article that explains the whole deal. http://www.boats.com/news-reviews/article/...e-contamination"
338396,tjsa,2009-05-05 14:37:00,1578,"Nice looking boat there Lew, congratulations, one quick question:  Do you think it will be a bit easier, or a bit more challenging, to land Musky by yourself in the new boat?"
338424,fishnsled,2009-05-05 15:49:00,3520,Great looking ride Lew.  Now get out there and enjoy the season!

338526,lew,2009-05-05 20:47:00,12766," Thanks for that link doubleheader, it's some interesting stuff. I'm always extremely cautious whenever I'm breaking in a new motor of any kind and follow the instructions very carefully."
338626,Mike the Pike,2009-05-06 01:51:00,3421,Very nice Lew now you have to go easy the break in begins.  Mine Is pretty well broken in 7 more hours to go and I will change the oil.  So far so good I like my new Yamaha 60HP.  Mike
338714,capt_hooked,2009-05-06 13:46:00,212,Congratulations Lew!  Boy-oh-boy... that sure is a pretty stainless steel prop...!  Watch out.. the Lake Nipissing rocks are already eyeing that baby...!!!!!  the cap't

337946,Cast-Away,2009-05-04 12:56:00,790,It's a beautiful boat Lew! Make sure to put a cloth between the motor support and the motor itself. Those plastic caps will wear the paint off of the lower unit in no time. I noticed that after trailering the boat just two times.
337949,mattyk,2009-05-04 13:04:00,2110,great looking rig Lew!

337980,Marty,2009-05-04 14:21:00,873,Lokks great bud!   I have to figure out a way to get in that boat for a day.
337981,Zubris21,2009-05-04 14:22:00,563,"Looks great Lew!  I wonder, what is the total weight of that package vs. the tow capacity of your van?  Just trying to figure out what my outback might be able to tow."

338150,JeffBornFishin,2009-05-04 22:30:00,260,A sweet boat Lew  Love that stand up top too.  Enjoy
338156,Handlebarz,2009-05-04 22:46:00,3790,Well Lew I guess that tops my trolling rod and reel combo I bought the wife for our 5th or 6th a few years back and with buying our boat last year I dont know what to get the wife for our 10th of Friday.  Diane is one lucky girl for you to get rid of your old boat for her.  Congratz on the new ride Lew AKA Skeeter
337751,lew,2009-05-04 00:12:00,12766,"Nuthin worse than buying a new boat in February and not getting it till May, but the happy day finally arrived and I picked it up yesterday from Hastings Marine. They did an excellent job of rigging everything exactly the way I wanted it and the covers I ordered turned out fantastic.  I kept my Globalmap 7200 GPS and one color Lowrance sonar from my old boat for the consol, plus bought another identical sonar for the bow. There's also a factory installed flasher in the dash board but I doubt if I'll ever use it.  It was nice too cause the boat comes pre-rigged with a shoot thru hull transducer so I didn't have to worry about installing any skimmers on the back of the boat. Theres a couple temp sensors factory installed on the transom so that'll give me my temp readings  I also ordered the new 62"" Fortrex bowmount, a MinnKota onboard charger and went with a 13 3/4 X 19 Yamaha stainless prop.      This is the mooring / travel cover    And the full stand-up top      The Fortrex    And the SS    I'm really happy with the new ride and hopefully everything works out as well as I hope.  Diane and I are heading to the lake next Friday and we'll be gone till November so I'm gonna get lots of time to put it thru it's paces"
