337538,highdrifter,2009-05-03 12:34:00,2534,"That is a monster!!  I see 7.24 on that scale though..  May I be so bold as to ask why the photo opp of that speck was taken on shore and not on the boat?  Those colours would have been way more vivid, especially the blue halos..  Thing looks like it's been dispatched for a while.  That lake is a gem though..  I'm sure I don't need to remind you of your responsibilities when it comes to fishing a place like that.  cheers HD"
337554,Whitespinnerbait,2009-05-03 13:57:00,2038,"  Highdrift....  We went to shore because all hell had broken loose ,, The fish was bleeding like a stuck pig , both my thumbs were bleeding like hell ,, from my partners yelling grab it , grab it   :devil:   Next outing I would like Leechman to get a Beast like that...   I might have the fish mounted or lop it in the Garden for fertilizer....   :unsure:      :wacko:"
337561,Terry,2009-05-03 14:17:00,14456,man I would kill for a fish like that but no fish in Ontario would touch that first lure......LOL

337597,Cudz,2009-05-03 15:36:00,2652,I think highdrift wants you to keep the name and location of the lake to yourselves to avoid ruining what appears to be an awesome fishery.
337618,Zubris21,2009-05-03 17:43:00,563,"Fish of a life time!  great job!  keep those reports coming!  and if you get a mount done, let us see the results!"

339278,Whitespinnerbait,2009-05-08 10:40:00,2038,"  What I should have at home ,was the 250lb Moose we brought along with us.."

337403,Fishing 24/7,2009-05-03 00:30:00,709,MY OH MY.... Whitespinnerbait cuts the report WITHOUT the details..................  we get to the ''PLACE'' in question at very early .... what we dont know is that we need to tow my alum. boat.....  OK we were three guys... my alum..... is NOT light...  + elec motor + 80 lbs baterries... we had 2.........+ all the usual lugage..............  we get to the fist lake where RYAN got his 4.5.....its all fun in games... i get the first speck...  Whitespinnerbait pulls out a 20 $ MINI SPECK NET.....to net my fish... :?    VERY BAD idea....... my lure get hook into the net and the speck released itsself.... :x  twas a nice 2 lbs for sure.....  well lets call it a nice C & R !  get around the lake and i cast near a fallen birch tree..... i had my polarized glass'S X RAY VISION STYLE!  i see 2 speck fighting for my lure....... yet 0 bites... im like ok thats nice....  continue the first round then i get a big hit... well the speck SMASHED my lure i go to set the hook..... pulled the lure out of his mouth....  im like................ :roll:  2 -3 rounds around the lake and its seems like the prime was in the mornning..... we ''heard'' by locals that there was another lake over the mountains.....  OVER... the moutains........  we are like LETS DO IT BABY!!!!  pays of big time as we all know ba hooked into somehting he though didnt exist......  a................... true...............FREAK      funny thing is that befor hitting this fish he said....  ''quote''  this erea is the type of structure where a seriouse beast would swim around...... ''unquote''  not a minute later he hits the speck of his life....  well THE OLD MAN  deserve this fish ....  i hope that ill be able to work as hard and be as determined as his is at his age.......  congrats paul and i realy hope you decide to put that fish on the wall becasue that fish isnt only HUGE and AWESOME...  but hold a great fishermans story....  24/7      NOTE: couple more pictures of the day   other angle of ryans  fish    my quebec red! i like this picture cause of the COLORS!!!    greenish!  :  after getting the ''FREAK'' on shore for a foto session... the fish lost weight... its must have spit out at least 10- 12 minnows....    LIVE ones....  and last but not least... you cant argue against ''THE DIGITAL SCALE OF TRUTHFULLNESS''    7.24........................+ a dozen minnows.........7.4!
337404,jediangler,2009-05-03 00:30:00,1923,Nice fish gentlemen. Great nature shots as well. That big snapper looks ornery. Last couple look like splake to me too.
337405,Viscount,2009-05-03 00:31:00,52,What a Monster! Well Done!  Nice Squaretail for sure. Take tons of pictures so they get the colours right on the mount!  K
337407,silverstreak,2009-05-03 00:32:00,146,Nice fish and pic's. Well done.
337410,Fudd,2009-05-03 00:34:00,94, Fair enough.. i can't see any... splake can have slight blue rings but i don't see the tell tail halo effect on the last one. So bloody hard to tell them apart at the best of times... i am still droolin over the fish to pay much attention anyways.
337412,Viscount,2009-05-03 00:36:00,52,Easiest way to tell.....every splake I've seen no matter how many times it was back-crossed had a fork tail.  They all look the same on the BBQ.  I need a new keyboard...this one's soaked
337414,smokin joe,2009-05-03 00:38:00,226,Wow that is a beauty for sure  Congrats Whitespinnerbait
337418,Cudz,2009-05-03 00:44:00,2652,you must have spilled your drink on it or something like that..  If you maximize the pics the blue and red is really clear
