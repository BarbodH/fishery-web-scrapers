333610,ehg,2009-04-22 20:05:00,2666,"Wow! That is brutal Jamie. Tough enough catching a big musky in a kayak, then having it thrash while a musky size hook is embedded in your hand is insane."
333612,highdrifter,2009-04-22 20:05:00,2534,"Where the heck is his creel?!  Seems to me that if one should go after lunges with a yak, they outta be prepared...  That's just begging for a hurting..  LOL  cool vid though!  HD"
333617,glen,2009-04-22 20:13:00,2641,thats one way to land a fish.
333621,Ron,2009-04-22 20:18:00,1683,"That was awesome Jamie. Thanks for that.  Certainly goes to show just how fast it can happen, even to the best of well seasoned anglers! Hope there was no damage to you or your nerves. As for the muskie, cudos to you for being so concerned of the well being of her too.   As for using the boga grip to lift her outa the water, I'll let you away with it this time.   Cheers, Ron..."
333625,jediangler,2009-04-22 20:22:00,1923,"Ouch! Thanks Jamie, I've been waiting to see this footage since last year. Another good reason to use a lure with a single set of hooks on it when fishing for musky from a kayak. At least then you know where the hooks are, in the fish. I also believe if you hand landed it instead of trying to use the Boca grip thingy you could have avoided the carnage. But that would have made for a much less dramatic video   ."
333654,Guest gbfisher,2009-04-22 21:22:00,0,All part of the Game....  Nice one Jamie. It's always the wee one that get ya!....
333723,mistyriver1,2009-04-22 23:02:00,600,OOOOWWWW  !!!  Great video Jamie.
333730,douG,2009-04-22 23:11:00,2693,"Crazyhook, that was extreme.  Cool that you had the homies handy, solo would have been another story. It looks like you guys can handle your yaks to the inch, also cool."
333735,purekgw,2009-04-22 23:19:00,585,"very nice fish and vid, you can see that its about to thrash when it cocked its tail"
333746,Leecher,2009-04-22 23:39:00,7832,That had to hurt Cool video Thanks for sharing Leechman
333750,Crazyhook,2009-04-22 23:49:00,1154," Hey Ron I did not lift it straight up I supported the fishes belly... better then using my gaff   I have been fishing musky for a while and have landed many, no need for a what is healthy for the fish lesson"
333764,Rizzo,2009-04-23 00:46:00,4754,"ouch, I was cringing every time that fish thrashed."
333779,family guy,2009-04-23 01:03:00,22,"Not much gets to me, but I couldn't watch much more than the first few seconds.  Every anglers worst nightmare...  I think I'll sleep with the light on tonight!"
333929,fishingisliving,2009-04-23 13:50:00,170," They got the coolest footage with that one, I dont think they could of even paid you to get you to ""want"" to do that for the movie.  the little ones(this was a big little one   ) are the worse for unpredictability I find. but imagine that would of been a 54 incher ? in the cold fall... with frozen fingers while she thrashes around..  Good job Jamie!! You would not of had that problem with a gaff tho... ;-)"
339485,Crazyhook,2009-05-09 01:25:00,1154,"The boys are off filming part two of the DVD, they left this morning for Panama! hope they brought the hook cutters!"
