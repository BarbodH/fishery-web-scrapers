339044,FLEX ROD,2009-05-07 13:41:00,394,"Picked some up a couple of years ago from BPS I think, not bad a little stiff but if I remember correctly it was cheap or on sale so for the price it was okay.  FLEX"
339051,CLofchik,2009-05-07 14:25:00,854,"Picked some up at the BPS spring sale.  For $2/300yrd spool it was overpriced. Stiff, thick dia, memory up the wazoo.........long cast my ass, this line is only seeing clear water carp duty now.  After fishing with braid for years, trying mono again just annoyed me on every cast."
339064,bbog,2009-05-07 16:08:00,665,"I picked up a couple of 4lb and 6lb ""finese"" spools at BPS during the $1.99 sale for use on my light and ultra-light rods. Prior to use I did my usual break test and found that each spool was overrated. The 6lb is now remarked 4lb and will used on my ultra-light. The 4lb is now remarked 2lb and ""might"" see some duty on my ice fishing rods??  It was a cheap gamble so if it doesn't cost me any fish....."
