338644,rbaquial,2009-05-06 02:20:00,968,Wow.... And I thought when I went fishing in Cape Cod for BLUEFISH/STRIPED BASS... that THOSE were a fight!! Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaan!! The fish I caught look like BAIT compared to those GOLIATH GROUPERS!!            
339506,profisher25,2009-05-09 03:11:00,185,HOLY FISH STICKS!!!! THAT GROUPER IS HUGE!!!!!!!
339507,cram,2009-05-09 03:17:00,1733,the fish (and their future business) would be so much better off if he just cut the hooks....no need to drag it up on the boat.
