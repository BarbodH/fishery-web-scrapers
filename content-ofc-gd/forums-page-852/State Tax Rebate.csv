339227,Michael_Brown,2009-05-08 01:54:00,411,I have read most of the threads I could find about importing a boat from the US. What I didn't find was info concerning state tax. If I pay $1000. state tax on a purchase and then pay GST and PST. Can I apply to the state for a refund of the state tax. I shouldn't need to pay tax twice for one purchase.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks
