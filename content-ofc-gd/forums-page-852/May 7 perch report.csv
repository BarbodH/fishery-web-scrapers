I finally got to drop her in the water today.  Today was mostly just running the boat to test it out, although Kelli and I did get to fish for about an hour or so.  We brought our perch gear and put a hurtin on them, no giants, but a lot of fish in the 8-10 inch range and a few around 11-12.  We ended up with 50-60 fish between us and brought home 12 for a fry.  The beer batter is already mixed!!!  Location:  We fished Lake Simcoe today on the East side  Depth/Structure: For numbers of fish, we found them in scattered weeds in 8 feet of water, for bigger fish they were on a rock/sand transition in 10 feet.  Baits: All fish were dropshotting a 1.5 inch tube (peanut butter and jelly was the best colour)    "
