We spend our summer at our trailer on Sturgeon Lake and my 11 year old son would like to sign up for basketball or soccer somewhere. Does anybody know if there are house leagues in the Lindsay area or not too far of a drive away?  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Cheers,  Peter"

339570,irishfield,2009-05-09 13:29:00,26272,"He sold the salvage to someone else. I don't think he left tooooo much fixable though......  I launched another virgin amphib out of here last Sunday to St. Lazaire. I flew it over to Midland, and after a flight around the patch with Bruce Olsen, he took the airplane owner home in it.  Here's Reid's mess.... hate when I see my ""babies"" like this. "
339572,perodimi,2009-05-09 13:33:00,124,YUK!  I thought it was just a little fender bender but didn't realize he flipped her over. I heard he just got caught up in the mud or grass with minor damage.  Heartbreaking indeed after all that work!  Peter
339574,irishfield,2009-05-09 13:35:00,26272,Mud and Soya Beans !   .... and too short a runway.. or too hot a day... or well lets just call it like TC would.. Pilot Error.
