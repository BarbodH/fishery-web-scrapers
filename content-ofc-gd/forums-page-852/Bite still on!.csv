339458,wuchikubo,2009-05-08 23:19:00,1114," Are you suggesting spoiling fish on purpose?  There's nothing wrong with letting the fish back to fight another day, if it was badly injured that is another matter.  BTW Court R, that's a fine looking cat!!"
339461,brifishrgy,2009-05-08 23:24:00,559,  if you notice the weigh scale he prob brought it to Fishmasters for the tourney

339502,CLofchik,2009-05-09 02:35:00,854,"From a boat?  The shore bite at Fishmasters was nonexistent today, the whole area is full of carp and every other shore spot I've found is pretty soggy with the high water."
339504,mikeh,2009-05-09 02:52:00,824,I'd estimate 38' long weight was 24 lbs...how close is that COURT R
