338709,tonyb,2009-05-06 13:13:00,1637,"Here is a quick summary of this past weekend fishing  Friday was Catfishing as the winds were too high for a pre-fish for a fun tournament that was scheduled for Saturday.  Met up with fishdawg and steve-hamilton and I think each boat managed a new personal best catfish including mine...they grow big in the Grand!!  My new PB! 21.02lbs 34inx22in    fishdawg with one on   Saturday was a fun salmon tournament held in memory of Trevor Field (oldguy), Jello and Aaron Shirley joined me for the day and we had a great time, even managed to win some money to cover expenses and then some.  Total count was 10 for 14 biggest 19lbs  New electronics worked great!           Sunday I had my cousin who is new to salmon fishing out, as well as Uncle Buck.  Fishing was a bit slower and the fish we found on Saturday relocated but we picked away and ended up 4 for 7, biggest about 8-10lbs, by mid-day when we headed home.          See you on the water! Tony"
