338625,kickingfrog,2009-05-06 01:50:00,8333,A friend is thinking of bringing his 4 year old to a monster truck rally. Where do you get ear plugs and or muffs for small heads???
338629,irishfield,2009-05-06 01:53:00,26272,Use the foam ear plugs. CTC.. Princess.. any safety supply of course.
338631,kickingfrog,2009-05-06 01:57:00,8333,I was thinking of combining the in ear plugs with the over the ear muff ... if such a thing exists.
338632,Mike the Pike,2009-05-06 01:58:00,3421, Your best bet is the ear muffs .Go to a hardware store and by the muffs I found some for $4.99.  We have been to the Monster trucks several times the muffs are the most comfortable.  I tried ear plugs the first time the kiddies found them uncomfortable and they some time fell out.  Remember kids can get ear infections quite easily so muffs is the way to go.
338635,Greencoachdog,2009-05-06 02:01:00,8163,Isn't the noise part of the attraction???
338653,jediangler,2009-05-06 03:23:00,1923,"Mark's work warehouse has them, but I don't think they are made in kid sizes."
338654,wuchikubo,2009-05-06 03:32:00,1114,"foam plugs open or closed cell would be alright from CTC / HomeDepot / hardware store. Just remember that they are meant to be disposable (1-2 uses only). The have different sizes with the closed cell plugs.  those red or orange noise muffs would be helpful as long as they fit properly. they can be fit over the noise plugs as long as the plugs don't stick out too much and cause discomfort.  if the child has custom swim plugs, they will work too.

338864,danbouck,2009-05-06 22:39:00,4380,Have a couple princess auto pairs and my 3 year old wears them all the time.
338866,Mike the Pike,2009-05-06 22:40:00,3421, GCD  I have been many times it is extremely loud for a child.  BTW the adult muffs will fit most little kids They be too big for Roy though

339001,Radnine,2009-05-07 10:30:00,1538,If you use the ear-muf types the kids can still wear threir ear buds from their IPods - CRANKED! Jim
339056,wuchikubo,2009-05-07 15:12:00,1114,And remember that a kid's ear canal is smaller creating more resonance in the canal causing the sound to be louder than what we adults hear.  Make sure the protection is worn properly too!  I've seen a few too many 20's and 30's yr olds lately with music / noise induced loss.
339057,LeXXington,2009-05-07 15:20:00,1928,Go for the muff's. Easier to make sure the kiddes are useing them
