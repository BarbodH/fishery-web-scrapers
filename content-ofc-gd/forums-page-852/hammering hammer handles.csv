338926,l2p,2009-05-07 01:02:00,346,"After a long night of bar hopping i woke up this afternoon feeling worst than better, i ate a small breakfast(granola bar) and was out the door. with all the recent pike posts i figure i go down to the usual and see if i could get into some. ended the day going 7/8 all smallish fish lost the largest one(go figure) sucks pike fishing by yourself specially when you forgot your pliers  enjoi       beat up one(looks like the bully that had him could easily fit a chunk of this fish in his mouth)    bumped into my friend taylor later on, he ended up landing this one and then loosing the largest fish of the day.  the worst part is the fish took off with hook line sinker... rod reel.. turned to be the sad ending of a good days fishing"
338931,Mike the Pike,2009-05-07 01:11:00,3421,How did he lose the rod out of his hands  Thanks for the pics soem really nice shots.
338934,l2p,2009-05-07 01:23:00,346,"unfortunately as he went to gill the fish it turned around and decided to head home, by this point in time he had already set his rod down thinkin the fish was all tired out.   sure does suck!"
339048,alphaalpha,2009-05-07 14:06:00,475," ouch, that's a tough lesson to learn, keep that rod tucked in an armpit or something.  at least you guys got some fish though, thanks for the report!"
339073,tdotfisherman,2009-05-07 16:24:00,317,Nice pics.. you should always remember the pliers.. they are very useful.. along with jaw spreaders.. Looks like you really hit them good.. I was out fishing yesterday afternoon for Pike and I didn't see or catch any.. but on Monday they were on fire.. strange little buggers they are.. nice report!
339074,drwxr,2009-05-07 16:25:00,453,"nice pictures, it will only get better as the weather warms up. why didnt you try to throw some lures to get his rod???"
339093,Leecher,2009-05-07 17:41:00,7832,Great report and pics l2p  Looks like you had a good time and got into some nice gators Really sucks about the combo Thanks for sharing Leechman
339117,muskeybugged,2009-05-07 20:20:00,282,Those are some monster handles!
339118,l2p,2009-05-07 20:43:00,346,"""why didnt you try to throw some lures to get his rod???"" we did no lcuk, went back down today with my friend rob, slower for sure. they did alot more following rather than taking. rain musta shut em down, rob did manage to land his first and second pike tho! im sure his report will soon follow"
339184,MJL,2009-05-08 00:15:00,2427,"Great report and pics!  Pike fishing without pliers...That made me cringe...Sounds like a recipe for disaster.  Anyone who fishes pike with me knows I have a phobia when it comes to multiple treble hooks and toothy (and also very slimy) critters.  With that said, I wouldn't mind having a go at the big mamma that took a few chunks out of that little one"
