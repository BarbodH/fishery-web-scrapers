338928,Mike the Pike,2009-05-07 01:08:00,3421,I had one it was a 1980 7.5hp Honda the dealer said it was that year.  If you need a pic just holler.  MTP
338936,Fisherman,2009-05-07 01:23:00,7201,"The only thing I can relate is when I bought my 1984 7.5 Honda, it was still brand new in 1987, just old stock.  They make a series of motors to cover a few years and sold as the year they are bought. It was the one with the blue leg and yellow prop, excellent motor, had it for 9 years, never let us down."
338974,SlowPoke,2009-05-07 03:32:00,2984,"Try narrowing it down by the serial number. Certain parts are good for certain years, especially electronics. The part will sometimes have a range of serial numbers pertaining to certain years."
