A friend of mine told me about this one spot which holds fish, so I gave it a try...  I just love fishing alone along a 40-50 meter stretch with no one in sight. pairs of fish were swimming around deep pools and shallow runs, which was a good sign...  only fish for the morning..   and the release..   didn't stay for too long since the sun was beaming right through the water in full force, i know the bite would be even tougher.."
338773,Leecher,2009-05-06 17:48:00,7832,Good job KelfuN Got to love it when you can have a long stretch of river to yourself to fish in.  Beauty chrome and thanks for sharing Leechman
338790,okumasheffield,2009-05-06 18:19:00,318,Not sure if anyone notices that the reel pouch does not match with the reel ... wonder when Okuma makes custom real like yours?  He/she must be a very good close friend to share such a nice spot  Dont spoil it!
338796,bare foot wader,2009-05-06 18:40:00,1354,I noticed the reel pouch as well...I have the aventa....pretty confident that is not an okuma reel....buddy is prolly just using the pouch with his reel......  that reel looks like a kingpin maybe???....beautiful reel for sure....
338849,ccmtcanada,2009-05-06 21:52:00,7971,Nice fish!  Getting one fish is better than none for sure!
338963,Victor,2009-05-07 03:08:00,1609,"lol, the reel pouch is the first thing that i noticed as well. Stop using the okuma pouch to protect ur kingpin haha!! Us Okuma users certain don't like seeing that  nice fish bud!"
338990,KelfuN,2009-05-07 04:02:00,246,LOL yeah its a kingpin.. they dont have a pouch for it yet!! if they did I'd use it.
339183,MJL,2009-05-08 00:06:00,2427,"Great catch Kelfun.  Always nice getting a quiet stretch of river to yourself...When I'm alone, I always seem to find myself in a zen like state listening to nothing else but the birds, the river, and the wind while keeping a close eye on the float as I trot it down a current seam - That moment I find freedom"
