Got to the pool with 4 guys telling me no action since 9am, off to a bad start already?!  anyways.. 2nd drift on a roe bag and fish on! spunky little dropback    tied on a new roe bag, first drift....fish on!!    I only brought about 6 roe bags today since i was too lazy to tie more, so i just used the remaining from last time..and the water was too perfect to not use artificials.. bait of choice: white jig.   there she goes...    didn't get any hits on the white jig so i switched up to a purple bugger.. i had a few bumps but no takers, then all of a sudden the float shots down like a bullet...another spunky little guy     majority of the fish caught today were in the 2-3lb range..no monsters..but im sure they are starving and will hit anything thats going down the river."
