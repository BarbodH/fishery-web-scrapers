338978,Cudz,2009-05-07 03:44:00,2652,"I am trying to find out whether I can troll 2 rods per person in Georgian Bay, more specifically wasaga Beach.  Here is what I read in the MNR regs. An angler may use only one line, unless otherwise stated in the regulations. Two lines may be used when angling from a boat in parts of the Great Lakes (refer to the Exceptions to the Zone Regulations for the zone in which you are fishing).  I also read the Zone 14 rules and I didn't see any exception. Can I run two rods per person if I am trolling in Georgian Bay in front of the beach in Wasaga?"
338982,Raf,2009-05-07 03:50:00,3495,no.  1 rod/angler on gbay.
338986,Cudz,2009-05-07 03:54:00,2652,Thanks Raf.  I have never run two rods there or even on Lake Ontario when I used to fish it 20 years ago.  I don't think you were allowed 2 rods/person back in the day anyway.
