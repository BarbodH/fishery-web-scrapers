338489,Slayingm,2009-05-05 18:26:00,204,Myself and a couple of close fishing buddies took our annual spring Brook trout trip this past weekend somewhere  between Bancroft and Renfrew.  Although the weather was not the greatest we did OK and caught 25 Specs in 2 days of hard fishing.  Small worm tipped spinners in gold/black and orange did the trick.  All the fish were caught in 4 to 8ft of water off of shoreline cover and the hits were hard.  We enjoyed a awesome brookie dinner and each managed to bring a few home to enjoy with our families.  The trip was fun as we hauled bush buggies behind our ATV's and brought in a small boat and canoe along with a ton of gear.  The trip in was up and down through some rough terrain and creeks and was just over 20KM each way but part of the fun for sure.  Here is a pic of a few I got on Day 1 of the 2 day trip.    These fish absolutely beautiful and some were full of scuds (shrimp) or leeches.  Be safe out there and remember to bring the bug juice with you as they are out now!.... Greg.

It's a lot of fun catching them on spinners and man do they ever hit hard!!! We catch them on Mepps Black Furry #2 black & yellow up here but don't tip the treble with worm cause it's got feathers on it.  Great job you guys and thanks for sharing Leechman
