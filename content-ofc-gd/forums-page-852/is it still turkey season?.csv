338957,DRIFTER_016,2009-05-07 02:41:00,10439,What caliber Chevy is that? I had several close calls when I lived in Grand Valley. I did use a small caliber Chevy on a 12 point buck one October. Unfortunately I was under gunned and all I got for my troubles was a $7000 repair bill. The buck got away.
