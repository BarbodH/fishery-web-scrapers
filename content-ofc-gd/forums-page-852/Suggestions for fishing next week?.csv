We're not really picky about species, just want to make sure its in season and have a great time!  We're in the Ottawa area, willing to drive anywhere less than 2 hours and also need to rent a boat. We tried phoning a few lodges but nobody seems to be open yet. If it's a lodge we will stay overnight. Your suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"
