336175,skeeter,2009-04-29 01:50:00,1907,i have a suggestion: how about we do a roll call ? with names so we know how many are going and TRY to remember the names..  Dann & kelly
336182,Roy,2009-04-29 02:00:00,13728,Good idea!  I'll start then. Roy and Miss Kelly
336196,skeeter,2009-04-29 02:27:00,1907,lol--
336214,SBCregal,2009-04-29 03:23:00,688,"cant make it, have a cottage booked on Sturgeon lake for opener."
336265,Gerry,2009-04-29 11:14:00,257,I'm thinking of joining up with you fine folks but need to know what kind of ramp they have. Can I launch my rig there?
336267,lew,2009-04-29 11:26:00,12766,"Gerry, it's a low angle ramp with cement patio stones leading into the water, then it's a firm dirt bottom once you get in the water, but you shouldn't have any problems.  You might want to call Lakair early though.....like now..... and see if you can reserve a dock for your boat. If you read the start of this thread, you'll see where our mods have changed the normal date for this trip and now were gonna have to share the facilities with another large group of people, so docking space could be at a premium, if available at all.  Our normal weekend was wide open, but now that we'll be there with the other group, things could be VERY crowded, unfortunately."
336282,John,2009-04-29 12:06:00,2956,John & Barbara....we will be there
336283,irishfield,2009-04-29 12:10:00,26272, Gerry I have no issue with mine. Just be sure to stay straight in with the patio stones.. do not tuck beside the dock. That cost me a trailer light thanks to a rock in there.
336291,Rizzo,2009-04-29 12:44:00,4754,"I spoke to Kevin last week to confirm my attendance. I'll be coming up thursday a.m. and staying until I receive the ""crayola cup"" for pike mastery. I asked Kevin about dock space which likely will be tight. He figured they's likely yank some of their rentals out of the water to free up space as most of the people that week-end own boats."
336294,lew,2009-04-29 12:50:00,12766,"Being as this will also be a long weekend, it could  be a very tough drive with all the traffic for anybody trying to get up there on the Friday."
336311,Gerry,2009-04-29 14:11:00,257,"Thanks Wayne.  Lew, thanks for the info but I'll be staying at my brother's at West Arm or at the in-laws in Sturgeon Falls so I won't need a cottage. Of course, I might need a cab (or wheelbarrow) to get me back to my brother's place."
336384,LeXXington,2009-04-29 18:30:00,1928,"Me, Dad, Bro and the late Terry Hunt's Daughter will be there to defend our wining title    This year with a 40hp we might make more than 7 knots a hour.  let the darts practicing begin"
336393,Dara,2009-04-29 19:06:00,3052,Great...missing another one. I head to Newfoundland for a couple weeks then
336398,JohnF,2009-04-29 19:18:00,3494,"Unless my teaching assignment is cancelled I won't be attending. I'm in front of a class until 4, then packing up materials etc and will be an hour away from home.  Guess I'll have to make other plans to collect my jigs from Dawg.  Probably someone from close by will be attending (like Slowpoke). Mebbe I can twist his arm to play courier. He only lives an hour away and if I play it right I might even get out on his boat.  JF"
336399,misfish,2009-04-29 19:20:00,29133, Im sure yer head will hurt just the same.LOL
336408,doubleheader,2009-04-29 19:56:00,497,"Hi everyone, only 8 more weeks and if you would be so gracious as to allow Amy and me to be considered part of your gang we'll be there with bells on, well heck, we're gonna be there anyhow so you'll just have to deal with it. This weekend is the start of pickeral here in northwest PA, it surely isn't like being on the west arm but our local water will give me a temporary fix anyhow.  Really looking forward to meeting all of you and swapping a few stories.  They worked so well last year we're bringing our baby duckling musky harnesses again this year. I made some design changes to the harnesses so now you can even cast the little critters without beating them up too bad."
336410,JohnF,2009-04-29 20:03:00,3494, Isn't that why the little beggars have wings?  JF
336415,Dano,2009-04-29 20:23:00,719,Have a good time everyone...
336424,irishfield,2009-04-29 20:36:00,26272,Leah and I MIGHT be down for the Saturday tourney if there's a boat spot or two available. Unsure though... at the rate I'm going we may not even make the lake by then.
339045,gdelongchamp,2009-05-07 13:43:00,199,I will finally be able to attend an outing with all of you  and I look forward to it. I will look forward to sharing fishing knowledge with some of the best outdoorsmen/women in Ontario. I will be coming from Sudbury and have booked a tent site for Thursday to Monday of the weekend. My brother and my son will also attend.
339191,Rich Clemens,2009-05-08 00:50:00,3131,Will be great to see some more new faces.  Keeps on growing and growing each year.
339244,Nanook,2009-05-08 02:35:00,565," Missed last year, and wont make it this either, we will be half way to P.E.I. at that time  Have a great time everyone !!!!"
304819,Roy,2009-02-11 02:38:00,13728,"OK so this is the story. As quickly as I could after the 2008 G2G I got hold of the 2009 fishing regs and determined that the 27th of June would be the best date for the main weekend because bass opens that weekend. I know that a bunch of folks will be there the week before and certainly a few will be there the week after. Now it seems as though Kevin and Leslie might be booked up for that weekend because it's a long weekend. (July 1st, Canada day in the following Wednesday) So, the date will remain the 27th so book now folks. What Lakair can't handle, we can book at any of the surrounding lodges...lots of them.  Let me know what you're doing."
304823,irishfield,2009-02-11 02:42:00,26272,Bass? They taste just as good before or after opener!
304827,solopaddler,2009-02-11 02:46:00,8605," Yep, yep. The only seasons y'all need to worry about are salt and pepper!"
304831,Joey,2009-02-11 02:53:00,9122,"Okay, I just booked.  All set  Joey"
304842,Roy,2009-02-11 03:21:00,13728,"I think I'm booked too, I just talked to him."
304892,lew,2009-02-11 08:36:00,12766," Unfortunately Roy, if Lakair can't handle our group as always and we have to spread folks around the area to different lodges, it kinda defeats the purpose of the g2g  It's 3:35 AM right now, I wonder if Kevins awake yet so I can book my spot while there's still  a few available"
304943,ccmtcanada,2009-02-11 13:57:00,7971,Bly and I will be there...going to book soon!
304951,John,2009-02-11 14:10:00,2956,I tried to book on Monday and got an e-mail yesterday AM that they had booked me for Jun 18 - 22 even though I asked for Jun 25 - 29!!!!! Tried to get in touch since and haven't heard back. Will call them again today..  Seems as though Leslie wants us to change the weekend based on the tone of the e-mail I received!
304959,Greencoachdog,2009-02-11 14:26:00,8163,  that doesn't sound good.
304992,John,2009-02-11 14:55:00,2956,Just got off the phone with Kevin. Got a place booked from Jun 25-29. He says that Bass season opener is always the weekend after our traditional G2G. He has another large group that book every year for the opener. I think that if you plan on going book now or you may be disappointed.
305005,lew,2009-02-11 15:17:00,12766,"OK, I just got off the phone with Kevin a few minutes ago myself and he asked me to pass this information on to everyone that's coming to the g2g.  As mentioned by John, Kevin has a group of guys that come up every year for the bass opener, which is the weekend of the 27 & 28 this year and they've  already pre-booked their cabins for that weekend.  All Kevin has for the weekend of the 27 & 28 is a couple of the small 1 bedroom cabins and he says they'll probably get booked soon too, so if you want one of them, you better call him ASAP.  Most of the campsites are still available for the 27 & 28th though  The weekend of the 20 & 21st is pretty well wide open for cabins & campsites so far, which is the weekend we normally go up.  I just booked my regular campsite for the entire week from June 22nd --29th to be sure I get in a full week of musky fishing which opens on the 20th.  Only 4 more months to go and I'll be in my home away from home.  "
305010,BITEME,2009-02-11 15:33:00,1968,Okay me and pointed are booked into our favorite groundpounder spot  Hey BigBird im looking foward to getting you alone in the woods  But you can always sleep in the tent with me and pointed and be the meat for our bread
305012,doubleheader,2009-02-11 15:35:00,497,"Hi everyone Doubleheader here from Pennsylvania. I've never had the opportunity to meet you folks but as luck has it we are booked for 2 weeks at Lakair starting June 27th. This is our normal 2 week vacation at Lakair and I'll be there with my wife Amy and our good friends Gary and Ellen Hubbard. I hope to get the chance to meet you all and share a cocktail or two. Please forgive my ignorance, but as an annual get together of OFC friends, do you have a friendly tournament?  I have been on this board for a few years and always wished I could meet everyone, looks like this is my chance. we'll be in cottage #11- please fell welcome to stop in for a cold one."
305015,BITEME,2009-02-11 15:40:00,1968, Oh Boy!!!!
305027,Joey,2009-02-11 16:11:00,9122,"Hi Doubleheader, it will be nice to meet you.  Yes we have a tourney, it is on the Saturday and is a pike tournament.  The most inches wins the Crayola Crew Invitational Trophy     There are lots of prizes also.  We also all bring a pot luck item to go with the fish we fry after the tourney, salad or some other specialty we all make.  Hope this answers your question.  Look forward to seeing you there.  Joey"
305033,John,2009-02-11 16:27:00,2956, Look forward to meeting you double header. A few of us partake of some mild refreshments during the weekend.....   GCD is our resident cocktail expert. I'm certain that he has one or two new recipe's up his sleeve.
305037,doubleheader,2009-02-11 16:37:00,497,Thank you all very much. Now I'm really pumped for our trip.
305086,TJQ,2009-02-11 19:49:00,7806,Yup... what Joey said!!
305129,Rich Clemens,2009-02-11 22:35:00,3131,Well thanks a lot ole buddy.  Move it from the third week to the fourth eh.    I was already booked for the week-end of the 20th.  Time for a fast schedule check and a phone call.
305168,Rich Clemens,2009-02-12 00:10:00,3131,"  Ah ... more Pennsylvanians .... sweet.       The good ol'e boys south of the Mason-Dixon line better watch out.  I just got off the phone with Leslie and since we had booked early, we were able to move the dates and will be arriving on Wed. 24th and leaving the following Wednesday.  Cabin 11 eh ?    It's a loooong walk from our Cabin 5. but for a cold one, we'll make the sacrifice."
305226,Loonietoon,2009-02-12 01:37:00,1450,Just got of the phone with Kevin & I have my same spot beside Lew's   Arriving on Thursday 25th early

305382,fishnsled,2009-02-12 15:16:00,3520,"  I was sooooo looking forward to going this year as we had moved our flyin trip later.  It would now be the same new date as the Lakair G2G.  Oh well, one of these years.  Have a great time everyone."
