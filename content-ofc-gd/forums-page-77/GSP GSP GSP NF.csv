1017162,manitoubass2,2017-11-08 17:13:00,11391,Wittaker vrs gsp would be a re match ending with gsp retiring on back to back losses I'm  Would LOVE to see that fight happen though!
1017165,Bass Tard,2017-11-08 18:21:00,128,"I think he should go get his other belt from woodley, the ufc needs a story right now, people would eat it up."
1017166,msp,2017-11-08 18:35:00,1336,People tend to forget that Robert Whitaker lost to Wonderboy ( TKO round 1 ) as a welterweight. I know he has improved quite a bit since then. But GSP's game plans are always a huge factor. Im not sure if Whitaker would easily beat GSP Just my opinion. I would like to see GSP take the belt from McGregor ( if he is still the champ ) and then retire as the G.O.A .T. wouldn't that be great
1017167,manitoubass2,2017-11-08 18:53:00,11391,Yeah I'd love to see him take out McGregor and retire on top
1017168,BillM,2017-11-08 19:25:00,17367,"I don't want to see him lose, I'd rather see him retire, lol."
1017169,manitoubass2,2017-11-08 19:34:00,11391,Any of you guys catch that week in the life of GSP type show about 5 years ago?  Doods a world-class athlete that could probably succeed in almost any sport.  It's crazy how dedicated he is. Most pro athletes are of course but he takes it like 2 notches above everyone
1017170,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-08 20:04:00,8243,"GSP is an Alien. He should be past his prime. Father time waits for no man. That is why I personally think his win is so monumental. I really will be surprised if he agrees to a Whitager or McGregor fight. It is no coincidence he went up a weight class, his metabolism and drop in his Testosterone is a natural phenomenon men face as they approach their 40's. However being an Alien he doesn't age.  I have to go back outside and finish this winterizing the boat bee ess."
1017368,PUMP KNOWS,2017-11-10 21:35:00,937,Good thing the ref let the fight continue after those elbows.  I'm very happy how the fight turned out.
1016930,Terry,2017-11-05 13:59:00,14456,GSP GSP GSP  he's back
1016934,Whitespinnerbait,2017-11-05 14:45:00,2038,The Machine is back up and running !!!!
1016938,Acountdeleted,2017-11-05 15:00:00,2562,Put Bispieg to sleep. Love it. Never been a fan of 'the count'
1016939,manitoubass2,2017-11-05 15:20:00,11391,"After a 4 year hiatus, that was pretty impressive!"
1016942,LostAnotherOne,2017-11-05 15:51:00,956,Great card.  Three title changes last night.
1016944,Terry,2017-11-05 16:22:00,14456,I didnt watch it till this morning so I had to avoid all media for fear they would tell me the out come gsp look tired in the second round   the the cut looked bad  but he did his job and did it well
1016950,misfish,2017-11-05 17:24:00,29133,"Clearly he will need to work a lot harder carrying that that extra weight. He was gassing. IMO,  If he had not caught Biz with the hook, it might of been a different out come. Biz was a class act after the fight, but if he had of won, Im sure he would of been trashing GSP.  Not bad for his return. He needs to go back to his original weight class.  He sure looked big though. WOW."
1016993,206,2017-11-06 03:54:00,563,if it went another round i think the out come would have been very different
1016998,dave524,2017-11-06 11:04:00,4508,"Appearing originally right after a grouse hunting thread I thought GSP was the commonly used initials for the German Shorthair Pointer on hunting sites,"
1017004,AKRISONER,2017-11-06 13:36:00,5558,"man did he add that weight in muscle or what holy cow...his boxing looked crisp too thats what you get when you learn from the guy that taught the pac man.  Dominant wrestling as always. Hate on bisping all you want, the guy is trying to make a character so that he can make a living. if you remember him on the ultimate fighter hes actually a pretty funny down to earth guy. He just has to play the villian to get the ratings up. You cant expect GSP to come out and act mean etc, so bisping has to play the role of villian. Classic heel vs face match. BIsping is a tough dude to have withstood that knock down and barrage of elbows, holy crap. No tap either on the choke, gotta love it. Classic jui jitsui."
1017009,Whitespinnerbait,2017-11-06 14:29:00,2038,hard to tap out when your asleep !!
1017019,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-06 17:34:00,8243,"To make a comeback from that long off and go to 185 pounds is remarkable and unprecedented in any sport let alone MMA. He looked huge, most likely 195 by the time the fight started. It rivals Ali's comeback from his boxing suspension. Actually I think it may be bigger because Ali had to fight, he was broke, GSP didn't need to fight, he was bored. I think he may be Canada's greatest athlete of all time, including Gretzky.  Everyone fighting in MMA is one strike or hold from loosing or winning. I need to watch the replay I was told GSP wasn't dominant up to the point he chocked out Bisping. I like Bisping, I was surprised he was beaking off up to the fight but someone has to be the guy to stir the pot to sell more pay per view. Ali was the first to spout off at the mouth in Boxing, he learned that from seeing Gorgeous George promote wrestling when he was a kid according to his autobiography.  edit: Just watched the finish on mma-core.com. He won this fight with a sharp left hook, Bisping didn't know where he was after that, 8 sort strikes while on the ground and zero defense from Michael Bisping when GSP put the choke on him, Bisping was out of it when that hook caught him. And a class act post fight. There will be a rematch."
1017020,woodenboater,2017-11-06 17:40:00,2277,"I like Bisping, he's more likeable than so many other fighters out there. I think he'd fun to hang around away from the cage. Most impressed with Namajiunas' win over JJ. She has a great head on her shoulders and super humbler.  Now to see what St.- Pierre does in his next match. Imagine how crazy it would be if he beat Bobby Knuckles ??!!"
1017021,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-06 17:55:00,8243,"I agree wood, I have had nothing but respect for Bisping since he was on one of the first Ultimate Fighter series. A class act."
1017108,BillM,2017-11-07 15:12:00,17367,"I hope GSP doesn't fight Whittaker, he'd get absolutely destroyed.  I love the guy, but I hope he hangs them up for good soon."
1017121,msp,2017-11-07 20:27:00,1336,^^^^^^ That's what everyone said about Bisping You can never count GSP out. would love to see him fight McGregor and take his belt too
1017124,Terry,2017-11-07 20:57:00,14456,"i too would not count him out, he is a different fighter in every fight he trains to beat the person he is fighting so his fight style is different for every fight"
1017132,Acountdeleted,2017-11-07 23:23:00,2562,I'd be soooooo curious to see GSP vs mcgregor. Even if it was at a catch weight. That would be a huuuuuge fight.
1017147,AKRISONER,2017-11-08 13:28:00,5558,"You guys nailed it...his wrestling perhaps is unparalleled, and then he boxes with pacquio's coach...so how do you beat him?"
1017150,Acountdeleted,2017-11-08 14:14:00,2562,There was a time he was training to be on the Canadian Olympic wrestling team but it fell through. The level his wrestling is on is unreal. His boxing is good but there are better in his weight class.
1017153,manitoubass2,2017-11-08 14:57:00,11391,That would draw a huge crowd but I'd predict a boring fight unless gsp was stupid and stood face to face with him
1017154,Acountdeleted,2017-11-08 15:04:00,2562,"Conner's boxing is better. GSP's wrestling and ground is better. I think it would turn out well. Conner would try to strike from a distance, GSP would keep trying to close the gap to shoot in and take the fight to the ground."
1017155,manitoubass2,2017-11-08 15:33:00,11391,"Boxing won't save you from a world class wrestler.  Gsp would be smart I'd assume and take the fight to the ground asap and that would be it.  Gsp was even kinda stupid to stand in his last fight. Anyone with a punch then stands a chance.  The thing is wrestling is boring and these guys wanna entertain, and that's where alot of great fighters lose."
1017156,BillM,2017-11-08 15:57:00,17367,"^^^^^^ That's what everyone said about Bisping You can never count GSP out. would love to see him fight McGregor and take his belt too  GSP knew Bisping coming in, don't forget they trained together    Whittaker is on a whole different level."
1017160,LostAnotherOne,2017-11-08 16:47:00,956,True bill about Whittaker.  He beat juiced up Romero. GSP has a few options.  Hate to see him go up against McGregor.  If so then both belts will be tied up for a year lol.  Whittaker would be interested.  His cardio is better then gsp. George is pretty smart and probably knows if he goes up against Whittaker then he has to improve his cardio to win.  Other option is Woodley.  Hes got good punching power but George has fought those guys before.  So with everyone out there Whittaker would be the most interesting fight and it would elimate another interim belt.
