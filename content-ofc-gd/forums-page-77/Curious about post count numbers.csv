1017666,lew,2017-11-15 12:49:00,12766,"I've never put much importance in post count numbers but on the old board I think I was up around 11 or 12,000 but notice now it's around 9800 and am just curious if any other things will be changing, specially in our profiles."
1017674,irishfield,2017-11-15 15:08:00,26272,"Yah, I just looked and I've lost about 7500 over night. Last evening I was 25K and change. I remember on one board update WAY WAY back that Roy and crew manually added the count from the previous board. Wonder if the new software did an actual count without those old numbers added in."
1017676,fishindevil,2017-11-15 15:41:00,6254,yes I have lost 700 or so as well just happen to notice as you guys looked so did I    might take a bit for things to work the bugs out...
1017686,HTHM,2017-11-15 19:30:00,4082,"Well, I guess we wont be as long winded as we used to be. Posting to check my count to be honest...."
1017701,SirCranksalot,2017-11-15 21:19:00,3291,"Ha---had no idea of my post count before. I'm sure it was a lot less that you folks above. I guess I'll find out how many I have now. OK---2,474! Sounds good to me!  "
1017703,aplumma,2017-11-15 21:34:00,6896,The post count might be from the last update. We did have some corruption in the data base and they may have had to edit it back to a saved point that it was still good. With the number of members we have it is not possible to go thru and adjust them though.  Art
1017704,lew,2017-11-15 21:38:00,12766,"Thanks Art, not a problem at all, I was just curious and actually kinda wondering if I was doing something wrong on my end with the new set-up."
1017708,GBW,2017-11-15 22:52:00,8460,I have no clue what my post count is but I guess I'll see after I hit submit
1017709,Rich Clemens,2017-11-15 22:55:00,3131,Kinda cool looking ....... The new board
1017784,fish_fishburn,2017-11-16 23:21:00,1311,I just took a look and I am missing about 1000 and change?
1017805,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-17 03:35:00,8243,Do we get Air Miles for X number of posts?
1017858,SirCranksalot,2017-11-17 23:58:00,3291,"Yeah, 10,000 will get you Rapala lure!! "
1017859,misfish,2017-11-18 00:00:00,29133,LIKE i WAS TOLD MANY 100000 POSTS AGO.  They mean NADA  LOL
1017875,Mister G,2017-11-18 14:05:00,1429,I wish they would be eliminated. Seen way too often newbies being ignored because they are not super regular here notice by post low  counts. And some post the most ridiculous subjects to attract attention and drive up their numbers. Just saying.
1017877,ch312,2017-11-18 14:30:00,1590,"I second that Mister G. Some people seem obsessed over post counts on various forums and some even have this idea that a higher post count somehow makes them more important or that their opinion is the only one that matters. Then, as you mentioned, we have those who make senseless single word posts simply to drive up their post count. I like seeing when someone joined the forum, but post count is completely irrelevant. Personally, I couldn't tell you if my post count changed if my life depended on it.   "
1017880,SirCranksalot,2017-11-18 15:08:00,3291,Very well put...............for a relative newby!!
