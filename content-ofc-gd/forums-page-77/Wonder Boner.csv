1017856,Fisherman,2017-11-17 23:26:00,7201,"I remember that ad from a few years back, I don't think it ever really caught on.   Whether or not it would work on all fish from perch to salmon and maybe a musky or two would have to be seen."
1017857,SirCranksalot,2017-11-17 23:46:00,3291,"would work well on rotten fish, which was what the demo prob used"
