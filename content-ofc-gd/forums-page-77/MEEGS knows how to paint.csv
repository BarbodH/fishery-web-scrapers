I was so impressed with what he had done, I needed to share his work, and his NEW meegs for this year.  I did up 4 for now with buck tail. Goby and shinner. Will use them for lakers and white fish.   His new meegs, is very detailed and well, I cant wait to use them this winter.   This guy knows how. Great job James and thanks again buddy.  "
