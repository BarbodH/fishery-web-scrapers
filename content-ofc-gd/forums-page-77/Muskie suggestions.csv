1017492,BrentS89,2017-11-12 20:38:00,13,"Looking for suggestions. I have been given 3 places but haven't fished any of them. Leaving from Kitchener I have Lake St. Clair ( Belle RIver), Rideau River (Kars area) or Lake Stoco (Tweed). Any help or other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks, Brent"
1017496,Moosebunk,2017-11-12 21:04:00,3970,"Welcome aboard.  Three easier fisheries to fish with Clair the easiest, closest and best shot for a bigger fish. Just gotta watch the winds outta Belle."
1017499,JohnnyS,2017-11-12 21:33:00,13,Stoco Lake when you live near St. Clair?  I'm an hour from Stoco and would drive to St. Clair before I consider that lake.
1017501,bow slayer,2017-11-12 21:53:00,1074,"st.clair maybe the best fishery in ontario,walleye,musky,bass,pike and great perch and  pan fish.  musky ,hard to beat st.clair"
1017540,jimmer,2017-11-13 17:17:00,2730,There is also some ice on the kawartha lakes right now.  Might affect your launching.

1017576,JohnnyS,2017-11-14 01:08:00,13,There is also some ice on the kawartha lakes right now.  Might affect your launching. It didn't affect me today.  But the self launch of my boat certainly made it a wet start to the day.  Still didn't stop 20+ walleye from making it in the boat (and back in the water).
1017578,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-14 01:14:00,8243,Good you man. Do you wear a survival suit this time of year fishing solo?
1017579,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-14 01:25:00,8243,We are looking at possible places to relocate to this spring. Anywhere in Canada really. My wife told me about of a place called Wallaceburg. I asked where is it? She said a few miles from Lake St. Clair. I said OK lets move there I don't need to see the house.
1017580,JohnnyS,2017-11-14 01:31:00,13,"Yes - survival suit is a must.  Too bad my boots didn't float.  Only if someone was there to witness it and record it, this certainly would have been a youtube hit.  Normally I drive the boat off or push it off but the trailer dropped so fast, I hit the brakes and sprinted out with precision steps such that I was still knee deep running along the trailer frame to the bunks to catch the bow of the boat.  Even I was laughing as I was in the process of catching my boat......hard to stop a 19' boat when it wants to go the other direction."
1017590,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-14 04:06:00,8243,"I don't launch alone but I know a guy that does with his 18 foot Prince Craft, and he's 70 some odd years young. Plus only has use of 1 good arm after a not so accidental shotgun incident years ago. The word can't isn't in his vocabulary. He is one old tough son of a gun."
