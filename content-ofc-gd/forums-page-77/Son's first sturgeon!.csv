""Dad this walleye is reallllllly big"" lol  I knew right away it was a sturgeon.  Young one but what beauty fish! Love these dinosaurs!!!  He was so stoked he talked about it for weeks.  This is going up on the wall in the new house     "
1017737,AKRISONER,2017-11-16 17:27:00,5558,right on  how big doÂ they get on rainy?
1017738,leaf4,2017-11-16 18:12:00,2466,"It's amazing how seemingly easy those are to come by up where you are, most people in southern Ontario never get the chance.  Great looking fish!"
1017739,manitoubass2,2017-11-16 18:29:00,11391,"They get about 8-9 Feet long, 100-150 or so lbs.  Nothing like those Frasier river monsters lol  This was just a youngin. Those scales on the back are razor sharp around that age.  But Bray landed it and handles it awesome! Swam off to live another 150 years lol"

1017990,Moosebunk,2017-11-20 03:50:00,3970,Those scutes are razors... Teach 'em the safe ways. Leah loved her sturgeon fishing this fall too.
1018005,manitoubass2,2017-11-20 15:19:00,11391,"I bet! Sooooo fun! Yeah there really is only one safe way to handle them, especially the youngins. Hold by the tail, pop the hook out preferably with pliers, keep holding the tail, use other hand to support under the belly."
1018006,manitoubass2,2017-11-20 15:20:00,11391,"He was pretty nervous lol, but he did it perfectly!"
