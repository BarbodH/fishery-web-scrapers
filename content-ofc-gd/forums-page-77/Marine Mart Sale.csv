An unusual type of sale where you make an ""offer"" on any item in the store and they accept, reject or counter your offer until you come to an agreement.  Apparently they do this at their Montreal store.  Some items I bought:  -braided nylon 20' x 1/2"" rope $19 -deluxe bicycle-style boat seat $35 -black tank treatment $11  These are the prices I paid today.  WalleyeGuy  "
