1017651,BassMan11,2017-11-15 00:27:00,583,Resized to fit right from my phone.  Just for iPhone users using their phone photos. Take a picture or pictures you want to post and send them in an email to yourself. It will ask you if you want to resize the photos and hit the small option and hit send. Then open the email you sent to yourself and download them. The photos will now be the proper size for uploading. A little complicated but it seems to work well. Hope this helps. Cheers!
