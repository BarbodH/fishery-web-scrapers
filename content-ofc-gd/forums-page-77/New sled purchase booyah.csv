1016144,muskymatt,2017-10-23 15:41:00,2608,"My decision was made and purchase complete. Skidoo Expedition 900 ace le. I pick it up the second week of Dec. Now I need to look for a covered trailer. Pretty happy with my selection, it will be perfect for wifey and me to hit the trails and also fer me to tow my frabill huut out onto the ice. Cant wait for the first run. https://www.google.ca/search?q=ski+doo+2018++900+ace+expedition+le&rlz=1C1CHMO_en-GBCA566CA566&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjL4MzxiYfXAhVExoMKHTu5BOcQ_AUICigB&biw=1366&bih=662#imgrc=jw4eXXrEBi3suM:"

1016147,AKRISONER,2017-10-23 15:52:00,5558,"heard those sleds are fantastic.  Just praying that bombardier came through on it, ive got two ski poos myself had trouble with one and the other has been great.  Cant beat a 4 stroke sled though, should be a lot more reliable."

1016177,limeyangler,2017-10-24 01:02:00,5204,I have the same sled with the 1200 4TEC in it...... you are going to love it! These beasts go anywhere and the articulated rear suspension thing gets you unstuck real quick
1016180,muskymatt,2017-10-24 02:13:00,2608,Awesome feedback. Thanks
1016181,Joeytier,2017-10-24 02:23:00,3990,Nice sled.  Haven't heard a bad thing about the 900 ace yet.  Did you get the wide track version?
1016182,limeyangler,2017-10-24 02:33:00,5204,Awesome feedback. Thanks   Here's some footage of mine in action. GET READY FOR A FUN WINTER!

1016187,spooner_jr,2017-10-24 11:33:00,193,"I had a 2016, if you are going to use it for trail riding, I would have the dealer set the skis to the wider of the two options.  It was easy to tip it with the narrow stance and long track.  The 900 Ace is a great motor, really quiet."
1016188,FloatnFly,2017-10-24 12:02:00,1640,Now we need to ditch these 20 degree temps....
