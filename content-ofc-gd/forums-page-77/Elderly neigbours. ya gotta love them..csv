1017413,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-11 18:25:00,8243,"She is the sweetest lady one will ever meet. Soft spoken, would never say poo if she had a mouth full, I have never heard her speak ill about anyone. The summer after her husband passed I spent a week to rebuild her stairs going down to the beach after it got washed away over the winter and she made me a smoothie one day when it was 30C. A pal stopped by to ask me to go fishing with him the next AM, I said I was too busy working for a smoothie, he told me I was insane. He was right. She didn't ask I volunteered, just like everything else I did for her come to think of it. I dunno.  I must be an idiot. Maybe I do these kind things to make up for my not so kind youth. I was bullied until I was about 15 or 16. My father lied about my age and I went to work for a contractor in the steel mills the summer of grade 10 to grade 10, grew 6"" and gained a good 40 pounds of muscle. I made a list of all those guys that made my life not so nice, I didn't include the 3 girls I had to run away from school everyday or they would give it to me too. A week never went by when I didn't beat the crap out of someone that was on the ""list"" and some that most likely didn't have it coming that weren't on the list. We got into fights because we were bored. We would drive out of town knowing a bar room brawl was in the future because we would hit on the country boys dates. The bully became a bully really. So for the past 30 or so years that I wasn't the person I am now I ask that if and when I get a chance to stand before St. Peter I get to tell my side of the story. I ran into one of those girls that terrorized me 25 years latter at a restaurant. I said out loud to my now wife, ""That's Rosie Z. the girl that used to beat me up in grade 5."" Rosie said ""I thought that was you, you were so cute we had to get your attention somehow."" Try saying hi instead. We had a laugh over it.  I better write a letter to Dr. Phil. Sorry all, I think the anesthesia and pain meds they gave me yesterday is still working. Time for a nap."
1017551,AKRISONER,2017-11-13 18:15:00,5558,"haha what a great thread  I spent many a winter days shovelling my widow neighbors driveway. My dad still snowblows out her place to this day. She has always been more than thankful though, thats all you can ask for.  my buddy was driving home one day and saw an elderly man struggling to dig out of a big snow dump. he drove to his house grabbed a shovel and headed back...sure enough the next week in the paper there was an article because this man had reached out to the local paper to tell the story of a kind ""unknown friend"" that came to help him.  I honestly truly believe this...if you want a  good gauge on what kind of person you are...put a general call for ""help"" out to do something...the number of people that show up will tell you just what kind of person you are."

You have to crunch the numbers. $200.00 in Chinese food for lunch, plus the case or more of brew, just for lunch and that was in 86'. Make note, no booze for the crew until the move is over. More than a few of the boys had to spend the night and then we started all over the next morning. My former wife wasn't impressed to say the least. Good times you will never forget."

1017565,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-13 22:17:00,8243,Get each kid to pack and carry a box of their own stuff and I bet they have stuff. 3 trips is 33 boxes. Leave the fridge and stove to the oldest kids.

1017314,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-10 04:03:00,8243,"Vance mentioned in another thread that his neighbour checked to see if his snow blower was ready to go because he does her snow. She can't be too elderly because she was on her way to work. We have elderly neighbours, my wife is 55 or 57 can't remember and she is the youngest here by far. My sweet 86 year old next door neighbour is a nice old lady. 4 or 5 years ago she mentioned that the couple that waters her plants moved away and doesn't know what to do. Having empathy as my folks are still alive and someday I hope there will be a young 60 year old that doesn't require copious amounts of meds a day just to take the trash out once a week will be kind to me some day. Of course you know what stupid said. She takes me inside to show me her plants, I didn't realize her Sunroom has 40 plants in it alone, plus the terrarium and about 25 others throughout her home. Proceeds to tell me how much each plant is to have, 1/2 cup every other day for this whatever you call it, this one 2 cups thrice a week, if this leaf turns this colour cut the leaf back 1/2 inch from the darkest portion, on this plant cut it back to 1"" from the stalk, and, and, and, and. She says ""you aren't writing this down!"" Also I need you to drive me to the airport and pick me up at 2 AM because ticket was 20% less, pick up at 5AM on a freeking Sunday. Needless to say I watered each and everyone once a week to 10 days and soaked the Begeezus out of them. I went with procedure for 2 weeks at first. Only a few croaked. I drive her to the airport and pick her up, pay for parking and each and every year, one year she actually gave me a 10 buck gift card for Hortons that she got for Christmas but doesn't like Hortons and I probably could use it. No gift cards since but did let me know the next day which plants had to go to Intensive Care. My wife has told me for 4 years tell her no. I couldn't. When she told me she was flying out of Toronto not Hamilton because she got an even better price the sound I heard was the crack of the Camels back breaking. I made up 5 excuses why I quit. She grilled me on each and every lie. Then over the fence grilled my wife too when I wasn't around to catch me in a lie, er I mean a fib.  Today she asks me if I know anyone she can pay to water her plants and caught off guard I agree to drive her the 6 hour return to TO and back. I have a month to come up with 5 more lies to tell her I can't take her. For the frosting on the cake she told me today she bought her grand son a $110,000 air plane to start his business, I have seen her grand kid here twice in 21 years. No wonder the other plant watering neighbours moved, probably at a loss.  Any suggestions? Rant complete.  edit: Oops forgot, she also asks ""Do what you have to do to make sure my car is running when I get home.""  Rant over."
1017315,manitoubass2,2017-11-10 04:19:00,11391,Wanna come help with my garden? It's indoors and takes alot of electricity.  But in 8-12 weeks it's very fulfilling  Only 50 plants

I would be careful as to how many million people you tell you grow dope to on the Internet, not a smart move. 50 plants 1/2 pound yield per at around $1600.00 a pound wholesale, $40,000.00 sitting in your house with 10 kids living there, real smart of you, really smart move. Especially where you live. You told me they will kill you for a dozen oxyies. Real smart Rick."

Come raid me if ya dare  The drugs here are meth and oxies. Nobody cares about cannabis  You'd be amazed at the growing process OI. It's all rotation.  You can't just steal a plant and sell/smoke it. Takes 8-12 weeks(depending on strains) then wet trim or dry trim plus curing.  I only grow so much because I make rso oil. Takes about 2 ounces of flower to make a gram of rso."

1017350,fish_fishburn,2017-11-10 16:58:00,1311,No Mexican brick weed here Rick. But it is good locally grown outdoor weed. The price is low because there is so much available I guess.
1017351,manitoubass2,2017-11-10 16:59:00,11391,"Lol Terry. I've got similar stories when I worked maintenance in RRFN.  In winter I used a 1 tonne to plow all the roads, and building parking lots.  Well maintenance on the rez was pretty boring alot of days so I just started doing driveways to kill time. I mean why now, two swipes I'm done.  Turns out that was a horrible idea and everyone expected it asap every morning when it snowed  Man I'd get alot of flack if I was busy with other things  One lady came out as  I did half a swipe on her driveway. She cursed at me for being white and working on the rez. So I stopped, grabbed a shovel and threw it on her driveway, said here ya go, do it yourself.  Man I thought I was fired for sure.  Chief and council just laughed and I got a PO to run to tompkins and order 200 shovels.  When they arrived my job was to throw one on every driveway except for elders.  That was the end of me plowing driveways lol"

1017366,grimsbylander,2017-11-10 20:43:00,3016,"IO, I had the same kind of neighbour once! She was a retired stock broker and would ask for ANYTHING if it suited her. My wife and I drove her to her doctor's appointments, babysat and shampooed her dog, planted shrubs, geesh the list goes on and on. And all without as much as a nickel in return. She even bought the house next to her because ""she wanted to control who her neighbours would be"".The icing on the cake came when she emailed my wife explaining her nephew was going to private school, she was going to have a yard sale to raise money for him, and could we bring over stuff for her to sell??? We were a young family, two kids(under 6), one with cronic care needs and only one income. My wife blasted her back and told her she should be ashamed of herself, knowing all well our predicament and asking for goods as well as physical help. No response, no apology, no thank you for what you've done, zilch. The free ride was over I guess.  Tell her nicely to bugger off. People like her know that they're being rude, selfish and taking advantage of you but just don't care."

1017398,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-11 15:52:00,8243,"It is a true story, some artistic licence has been taken for entertainment purposes, like most stories. This isn't the first time I've been taken advantage of by the elderly or physically unable. It's my nature plus some paying it forward. My Father is the worse to take advantage of neighbours, the worse. All his life he knew each and every skill neighbours and co-workers had. He would ask the electrician across the street to do him a ""little"" favour and the next thing the poor guy knew he was fishing wire through a ceiling to hook up a ceiling fan. The plumber next door was asked to look at the drip in the shower and he's tearing the wall out to re plumb the tub and shower, and tiling it too. I always played stupid and the useless one and left all the repairs including putting a new roof including trusses on the garage to my not much younger brother. Now I guess I'm making up for my Father getting others to do for him because I didn't, maybe, I missed 7 years of Phycology school. When I bought my first home my father came over when I was doing the rec room. He wanted to know when the heck I learned all this? I always knew Dad, you just never bothered to ask me for help because you said I was too stupid to do anything beside play sports so I just played stupid.  As far as announcing to the world one grows dope at the same place you have your young family living all that I can say is ""Loose lips sink ships."" Balance deleted. You aren't a stupid man Rick, don't do stupid things no matter how many reasons you have in your head to justify them. An addict will steal anything they don't use to sell so they can feed their habit, weed included."

Once spring came he replanted them outside in his secret spot. LOL Once it got close to harvesting the plants, he began to brag to one to many people. The day came to harvest and all that were left were 1 inch tall stocks. LOL Like OI said loose lips. It was a shame thou, I had a chance to see his plants before they grew legs. About 4-5 feet tall and the darkest of green; all that was needed, was a little ripening on the stock and then curing, Someone got one hell of a crop. LOL  Dan."
