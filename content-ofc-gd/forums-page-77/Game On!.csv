1017305,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-10 02:54:00,8243,"A few new Hibiscus flowers bloomed today on the deck. Going to 0 tonight. People are freaking that their pipes are going to freeze,guys and gals are running around like chickens with their heads cut off because they haven't winterized their boats yet. A lady called the shop today in a panic because her husband told her to get someone to winterize the boat as he is away. Why it's up to her is for Dr. Phil. She said it's in the garage, I told her to close the garage door for the weekend. It's calling for +10C next week. You guys can keep your cold right where it is."
