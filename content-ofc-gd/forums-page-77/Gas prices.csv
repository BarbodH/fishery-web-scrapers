1017269,Jon,2017-11-09 18:15:00,209,Found this web-site that compares the price of gas and a barrel of oil.  http://www.TorontoGasPrices.com/retail_price_chart.aspx?city1=Toronto&city2=&city3=&crude=y&tme=1&units=ca  Jon
1017275,manitoubass2,2017-11-09 18:53:00,11391,"That's weird, perfectly legal to buy rez smokes here.  But for gas you need a gas card issued by the federal government to get the discount"
1017276,G.mech,2017-11-09 19:20:00,830,"That's weird, perfectly legal to buy rez smokes here.  But for gas you need a gas card issued by the federal government to get the discount  On Six Nations, you still need a gas card to get the full tax break but they also sell gas perfectly legally to 'non-natives' with only partial taxes.  I'm  not sure which one they're not charging now, there are so many to choose from but I think it's one of the federal taxes. The fuel isn't coloured and you save around 10-13 cents/litre typically.   The pumps even have different buttons for 'Native' & 'Non-Native' prices.  As far as the smokes go, you can buy them but technically you're not supposed to take them off the territory since the federal excise tax isn't paid.  The yellow band on the overwrap shows whether the tax is paid or not and if it's not there, they have been ticketing some people."
1017277,manitoubass2,2017-11-09 19:27:00,11391,Ah I see. Our smokes do have the tax paid.  As for gas it's no cheaper than anywhere else unless you have a gas card.  I'm paying $1.01 right now with the card
1017283,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-09 21:45:00,8243,"No Glen NO, you sound like the ""typical Canadian."" Oh well, can't do anything about it, they must have a good reason to do whatever they do. We Canucks could use a bit of American rebel in us. Canadian rebel is an oxymoron.  If I remember correctly wondered if fuel prices would get back to pre storm prices. It was $1.07 before the Hurricanes and now a buck 20 is good? I don't think so. We are the most gullible citizens in the free World which ain't so free.   Rick,me thinks if those smokes up there had taxes paid it would have a stamp on each pack and they would be the same price of off the Rez. They don't have excise tax stamps on them here. Your Rez cigarettes are made right here in Haldimand. The factory is cleaner than the local Hospital and is larger. It also employs many local folks, First Nations and those from other nations. The employee payroll is as diverse as the U.N."
1017290,manitoubass2,2017-11-09 22:37:00,11391,"They don't sell cigs anywhere off the rez.  And they have quotas. They can only sell so much per year. Try getting smokes in December, impossible unless you go to couch which has a way higher volume allowed for sale  Here in RRFN you better buy a carton because they might be sold out tomorrow"
1017300,gaspumper,2017-11-09 23:44:00,393,Gas on the rez here is $1.04.9 . In town its $1.24.6 today
1017306,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-10 03:03:00,8243,There isn't a corner store in northern On. that sells cigarettes? If they have a quota I can send a 53' tractor trailer full for you and you can make a quick million. No C.O.D.
1017309,manitoubass2,2017-11-10 03:18:00,11391,"Nope, they won't let you buy more than 2-3 cartons depending on who you are/if your in good.  The quota would be done in July if they allowed huge purchases here"

1013296,John Bacon,2017-09-13 00:36:00,3277,So now they say gas prices are dropping due to they are making WINTER gas. OK  Someone explain this to me.  Winter gas evaperates quicker than summer gas; so it works better in colder temperatures.  I am not sure if it is much cheaper to make though.

Our fuel prices stay pretty much the same for years with just the very odd change up and then back down. This happens at most once a year.

I have read in our weekly rag of a few people pulled over on Hwy. 6 for a traffic stop and Rez. smokes were in plain site. They were charged. I have never heard of charges for getting gas.

That would cause potential shortages here in the future. So BIG oil who loves and protects us Canadian consumers has RAISED prices immediately to protect us from that happening..... Gee thanks  We are so conditioned to believe stupidity with respect to gas, insurance, cell phone data and taxes, so the lies, fly and we in Canada buy all of them at inflated prices.  That no one in power dares to question..... Why, when as EVERYONE, who add and subtract has pointed out in this threat, that any price we see for GAS is far cheaper currently in the US of A, would a trucker come north pay more to sell it for less there, is believable. Makes the LIE they are using to PROFITEER on the storm all the crueler. Yet the oil execs will get away with it, and earn huge bonuses for doing it.

The car's got 5800K on it now with a life time avg 6.4L/100K so I'm lucky there and yeah it's gas and I use the turbo and run the AC."

1012726,pics,2017-09-05 01:52:00,1268,I took all my gas cans and filled them up at 99 cents a litre the day before it was supposed to be going up 5 cents because I knew that little increase was too good to be true. It's 30 cents higher and I still have 75 litres left. People complain about the price of gas but still go to Esso and pay 10 to 15 cents more than it costs at Costco or Pioneer. I save a couple of hundred dollars a year just planning my shopping and gas stops.. Better in my pocket than in the big oil companies ..
1012730,DRIFTER_016,2017-09-05 02:08:00,10439,​The gas price Olympics of Ontario I do not miss!!! Up here in de Nord they keep the prices stable for some reason. Current price is $1.139 which it's been for quite some time now. Had a 2 cent jump a few weeks ago for a couple of days for some reason but then went back to where it was.

1012743,Headhunter,2017-09-05 12:57:00,5703,I'm wondering how/if the renegotiation of NAFTA will affect future prices. Canada is bound by NAFTA to supply the US with crude at a price lower than world markets. I wonder how Uncle Donnie is going to react if the Canadian government has the testicles to re-jig that tid bit and use it as leverage with respect to things like softwood lumber and such. HH

Everyone will use supply and demand to explain costs, so the cost of electricity will go up even more when more electrical vehicles hit the road. We're like cattle being lead to slaughter."

1012526,JoePa,2017-09-01 19:59:00,179,Just for the record - it was Bill Clinton that signed the NAFTA - not Reagan - also be glad that you can get gas - there was a time in the 70s when you couldn't get gas at any price - I see people buying bottled water at a price higher than gas and just think how easy it is to bottle water than it is to make gas - when the price of gas is high don't ride around as much
1012530,John Bacon,2017-09-01 20:52:00,3277,#2 sir  It would be true if we didn't have HUGE surpluses of gas/oil worldwide  Once you work with the consultants you'll hear all about how OPEC operates.  It's called financial conditioning in the oil industry Are you talking about supluses of oil in the ground; crude in storage/transit; or refined gasoline?  Taking refineries in North America off-line most certainly will affect the supply of refined gasoline in North America.  It doesn't matter how much excess crude OPEC (who have nothing to do with this increase) have access to around the world; if you take North American refineries off-line then you will reduce the supply of refined gasoline in North America.
1012532,Old Ironmaker,2017-09-01 21:14:00,8243,Yes it was but it was Ronnie and his Irish buddy Brian that started the ball rolling 7 years earlier. 7 years to negotiate it and it's going to be renegotiate in a few months? Nope.

1012546,John Bacon,2017-09-01 23:37:00,3277,"Exactly jimmer,if anyone thinks electric vehicles will be less expensive to operate is woefully naïve.  Yeah, they are getting a free ride right now (subsidized purchase price and no gas taxes) and still cost more than a gas vehicle.  If electric vehicles become popular, the government will have to find an alternative source of revenue to replace the taxes that they currently collect from gasoline sales."
1012547,ketchenany,2017-09-02 00:13:00,3229,"JB you are correct. I'm now  in a ""study"" area where they will study electricity pricing! Drop it here and raise it there FREE thermastats, another ton of $$$$. So they said it will drop 25%, it hasn't yet. I wrote the Minister of energy, my MPP and Whiinie and by the time this study is finished we will probably be paying more I don't old them. NO answer as usual. SInce gas prices are going up why don't they reduce the taxes to help us out?"
1012549,GBW,2017-09-02 00:50:00,8460,Gas in Lindsay was between 116.9 to 126.9 and the radio says going to be around 133.9 in the morning. What a rip off!!

We have to ship our oil to the staes so they can refine it for us and charge whatever they want. Thank you Mssrs Mulroney and Reagan for NAFTA.

1012477,John Bacon,2017-09-01 04:01:00,3277,What is the price per barrel. Why is the price per litre so high?  A lot of oil comes from or is at least refined in Texas.  All of the flooding will reduce the supply.  Supply and demand.  A drop in supply or an increase in demand leads to higher prices.

1012500,Old Ironmaker,2017-09-01 14:32:00,8243,When gas prices go up gas prices go up. What I mean to say is that all those 18 wheelers chugging up and down our local 80K highway going to and coming from the Nanticoke refinery have increases to their costs to transport our Canadian refined fuel. The long arm of world oil prices has a domino effect. It's not fake or false news. I have to note most of the trucks carrying the juice are northern US state trucking companies.
