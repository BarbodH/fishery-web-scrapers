1017442,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-11 23:31:00,8243,"You are right G.Mech, again. I only use Shell Pro V in the boat now. Plus I add STP. (please don't use STP if you find an old can of it.) I wonder if they still flog it? It worked great in my 63' Pontiac Parisiene."
1017163,grimsbylander,2017-11-08 17:24:00,3016,"Agreed but how do you get the antifreeze throughout the livewell plumbing if you dont pump from the intake at the back?  My shutoff valves are between the pumps and the transom. On my boat, the outlets are slightly below the valves so they drain easily every time. When I add the antifreeze and circulate, I'm filling the pumps and the Flowrite valves and that's my only concern. Keep in mind, I have a bassboat so if the outlet is higher such as it may be on a deep-v, there may be water between the valves and the outlet to contend with."
1017237,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-09 04:37:00,8243,"I'm trying to understand how you would pump the anti freeze from the transom inlets up to the livewells?  I had a question today for the marine Guru's. Why not use windshield washer antifreeze? Good for -40C and on sale for 99 cents a jug? No one will be drinking from those water lines in the spring. If the temps get to -40 I am going to have some other serious problems like frozen water lines as the heat trace for this shack is good to -40 and that's it.  Side note: I couldn't finish winterizing today. All ready to fog and I open the new cans of Fogging spray and the push buttons are missing, on both!!!! None of the cans I have around here have a button that will fit. Quality control these days just suck. Now I have to check each and every spray can of whatever now to make sure it has a trigger button???? Looking at all the cans I have I did notice there are several different styles of buttons now."

Walleye fishing is just starting to heat up around my waters.. just like to winterize the plumbing with the cold weather coming up. CanTire had rv antifreeze on for 3 bucks a jug. Took me 5 mins to reflush the plumbing again tnight. -6 next 2 nights. I dont mind being too careful. Gives me a chance to crack a beer and pretend im working on the boat for an hour while the wife watches whatever it is she watches. As long and im not watching it...life is good!

1017245,Garnet,2017-11-09 11:08:00,2056,I don't remember did you put fuel stabilizer in. ! use sea foam because it has no shelf life. It's the 1 thing you don't want to if you get caught in a fast freeze so do it early and just top up if necessary.
1017247,captpierre,2017-11-09 13:13:00,2521,Funnel with some kind of short hose. Attach hose to livewell intake at back of boat. Remove screen first. May not be a tight fit. No big deal. Fill funnel and let boats livewell pump to pump it forward. Wait till pink liquid arrives in well. Make sure livewell valves are open (at top of livewell compartment to the side)
1017256,G.mech,2017-11-09 14:54:00,830,If you can get one of the throw-away flexible spouts they give you on the DEF fluid jugs they screw right on the 4L anti-freeze jugs and work great for this purpose.
1017280,b_cdot,2017-11-09 21:18:00,270,Good call! Added seafoam about 3 weeks ago. Its likely still in the system
1017310,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-10 03:21:00,8243,"Seafoam is not a fuel stabilizer to protect from Phase Separation within ethanol fuel, it is a fuel additive to help clean carbs and injectors, tune up in a bottle as it's often referred to. Many marine Guru's call it Snake oil. If you use a fuel like Shell Pro V no stabilizer is needed. My opinion and many others only. For the price of a bottle of 2+4 I add some anyway. I have only used Shell Pro V in all my boat engines and power tools since our good old friend Wormdunker told me to. The difference in price for Hi Test is about 10 to 15 bucks a tank for my 115, a no brainer if you think about it really. It's not like your putting 1200 to 1500 K's on the boat a month."

1017370,b_cdot,2017-11-10 22:01:00,270,I usually throw a can or two of seafoam in throughout the aeason. I use merc quikstor for winterizing atabilizer. I will use this when the boat goes to sleep for the winter. I have also been told by ppl it stabilizes but its not the beat choice. The side of the can says it stabilizes as well.
1017384,smitty55,2017-11-11 02:05:00,928,"I've been using Seafoam for many years now. My understanding is that it will stabilize fuel for two years, not that any fuel should be kept that long anyway. I put it in my premium small engine fuel as soon as I buy it. And yes it does prevent phase separation, they've always touted this feature from way back.  Cheers"
1017408,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-11 17:37:00,8243," Thanks Wayne, looks easy enough, now watch what happens when I do it.      Thank you both.   I stand corrected. I am just so biased from being on iboats.com where most all of the Guru's there call all this stuff Snake Oil. Snake Oil or not I'm using it, like I say it helps me sleep during those cold winters nights. Many times I have awoken in a cold sweat trying to remember if I did everything I was supposed to do winterizing the boat. I don't need to make a $7000.00 mistake and freeze up my outboard or leave water in the bilge and crack the hull or pop some rivets. After the 1st few times I did it myself I finally made a checklist and checked off everything I did, so in the middle of the night I check the check list if I remember where I put it.  I used to pay the ""guy"" to do the winterizing and it wasn't cheap. Once I watched a few You Tube videos and saw it done by Featherstone Ted I smacked my head against the boat because it really is simple. As long as I have my checklist when I do it. Besides doing the winterizing it's good to look around while the cowl is off for anything that looks amiss and remove the props grease and to check for line etc. I found 2 screws missing and 2 screws backed off on the carb cover the other day. I tightened them up and made a note to replace the missing screws, where they fell who knows. I stuck a wire magnet down where no small hand will even fit and found a screw but not that screw. I may not sleep until I find where it came from. Owning a boat is so rewarding."

1017414,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-11 18:39:00,8243,"It must be good stuff then Mr.G, but will it seal a leak in the hull?"
1017428,G.mech,2017-11-11 20:52:00,830,"How does ethanol free gas undergo 'phase separation' anyway?  Unless there is ethanol in the fuel, there are no phases to separate (at least according to the scientific community anyway).  The stabilizers may do more than just prevent phase separation but if you're running ethanol free gas the benefits may not be as much many folks believe (although better radio reception would be very nice at times...)"
1017434,Mister G,2017-11-11 22:19:00,1429,"It must be good stuff then Mr.G, but will it seal a leak in the hull? YES, but you have to heat the can up first in the microwave.....then just pour it in the bilge and let it do it's thing. Makes good toothpaste too . . . ."
1017045,b_cdot,2017-11-06 22:44:00,270,Hey guys. Cold weather on it way the next few nights. I want to flush some antifreeze through livewll tonight. Does anyone do this with their bilge? If so whats the easiest way to do it? I have a lund pro v and it takes a lot of water in the hull to kick on the bilge. I dont want to buy a bunch afreeze to fill up the bottom of the hull. Any ideas or do i even need to do it.
1017046,DRIFTER_016,2017-11-06 22:50:00,10439,Never done it. Never felt the need to. Just pull the plug so any water drains out.
1017047,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-06 23:00:00,8243,"Pull the plug and let her drain. Then I will run the bilge dry for a few minutes in case some water is still in the pump. Same for live wells. I leave the plug out during the winter, I have seen plenty of moisture build up over the winter. I wouldn't believe it until I saw it in the spring when I pulled the plug and I know that boat was put away dry as a bone. I tape a piece of screen over the drain to keep Meeses from invading.  Question, how do you get antifreeze into the livewell inlet? I pour some into the drains until they are full."
1017049,seanik,2017-11-06 23:23:00,38,"Hold the shopVac hose tight around the outlets and suck em dry, also works on marine air conditioners. This methods also can be used to suck the pink antifreeze through live well outlets, bilge pumps etc."
1017051,Rizzo,2017-11-06 23:43:00,4754,Never done that just pulled the plug
1017054,b_cdot,2017-11-07 00:25:00,270,Yup ive got it jacked and plug is out. Im just wondering if moisture build up in the pump itself can be damaged? Thanks for the input guys. Sounds like its pretty common that nothing is done. Im wanting to do some of my own winterizing this year to save some money. My boat mechanic never flushed the bilge out in the past but always did the livewells. The boat was bought used and not winterized correctly and one of my livewell connections cracked. Dealer said it was likely ice that caused the damage
1017056,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-07 00:32:00,8243,"I love that idea. Winterizing the boat tomorrow, I'm going to do that too, thanks. I have winterizing OCD. Dryer sheets, moth balls and Irish Spring soap in every nook and cranny. I know guys that pull it out of the water, pull the plug, tilt the outdrive or OB down to drain the water and that's it. No fogging, no gas treatment no nothing including leaving the battery in all winter. I'm on a meager budget plus I wouldn't sleep all winter.  The saddest day of the year for me without going to a funeral. It was too nice today to do it. Should have gone Smallmouth fishing here on Erie, water was like glass."
1017059,captpierre,2017-11-07 00:47:00,2521,Never did anything to my Lunds bilge  pump For live wells I unscrew the intake screen at the back and using a funnel with flexible corrugated tube attached to fill intake with RV antifreeze First close valve in rear well and opening front well valve. Pump until pink liquid comes into from well. Then close front and open back. Pump. Takes about 2 litres of antifreeze. Open all doors to ventilate. Unhook starter battery after charging fully. Deep cycles stay connected and get charged monthly for a few minutes. Then kiss her good night.
1017061,BillM,2017-11-07 01:00:00,17367,"Only thing I do is make sure the bilge is dry, same goes with the livewell.  Take all the plugs out and let it drain anything in there."
1017065,b_cdot,2017-11-07 01:44:00,270,"I just did the livewell flush and flushed the recirc. Cant believe i use to pay to have it done. I opened all valves and it pumped up to the front and back no problem. I only used about 2-3 litres. I also leave batteries in and plug in to charge once a month. I give them a good check (fluid levels, hygrometer and voltage) before i put it away. Not exactly putting it away yet just wanted to flush livewells with the upcoming temps"
1017067,b_cdot,2017-11-07 01:48:00,270,Anyone have proof that the dryer sheets work? Ive been told the same thing for years... it would be a good mythbusters episode

1017081,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-07 02:58:00,8243,I use the dryer sheets and Irish Spring soap to get all the fish smell out of the boat after slaying them all season! I don't know if it works all I know is I haven't had any meeses and the boat smells nice like a Spring Mornin'.

1017086,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-07 04:16:00,8243,"I can't see how any damage could be done to the pump running air through it, actually may help getting bilge scum out. That may be a good time to pour some bilge cleaner in it. Running it dry won't harm it either, not mine at least. I accidentally engaged the manual switch about 6 years ago and it ran until the battery died, that had to be a very long time and no damage to the pump."
1017093,Mister G,2017-11-07 12:00:00,1429,"I am always amused at this time of year with all these winterization procedures that people have. Hey if that's what gets you off go for it but 99% of these procedures are not necessary.  This is what has worked for me during the last 33 years of owning a boat with a bilge pump and livewells.  Crank the trailer all the way up so any water in the boat drains back towards the transom.  Turn on the bilge pump and livewell pump so if any water is present it pumps out. Leave boat like this for a few day and turn pumps on once more. If no water present you are done with winterizing your bilge and livewell pumps. If water is still present repeat this until now is pumped out.  Now this is the difficult part and you might want to pay someone to do this. Get some moth balls and put them in various locations within the boat and MOTOR. However, trying to catch moths and dissecting off their balls can be challenging."
1017094,wkrp,2017-11-07 14:08:00,656,I use an air compressor to blow out any residual water. 90 PSI works wonders
1017100,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-07 14:39:00,8243,"Moths do have rather large testicles for such a small insect. 1st laugh of the day Mr. G, thanks.  There will be as many different winterizing procedures as there are boats out there. I too paid to winterize the boat before I watched many videos on YouTube, even marine dealers procedures vary from one to another."
1017117,irishfield,2017-11-07 17:53:00,26272,"The only thing you have to remember is when one of those thru hull live well pumps, or power washer pump inlets breaks off inside the transom, your boat sinks as your bilge pump isn't going to keep up.  Temagami marine has about 200 boats with thru hull pumps stored there by my estimation, only 2 sunk last year on their first night tied to customers docks. Do you want to be in the 1%??  $3.00 worth of antifreeze and 20 minutes of your time. Just did mine this morning and then capped the intakes ready for Musky fishing.... if I can ever find the time to get out there.  Oh.. and b_cdot, if you hull is dry your bilge pump most likely is too as it will drain itself into the hull of the boat. It's as simple as blowing hard into the outlet on the side of the boat to make sure."

The whole process takes minutes and I never worry ""did I get all the water out?"". There's just too much in the way of batteries, wiring and onboard charging to have to find a cracked pipe or pump to not use antifreeze. Just my opinion though."
1017161,captpierre,2017-11-08 17:02:00,2521,Agreed but how do you get the antifreeze throughout the livewell plumbing if you dont pump from the intake at the back?
