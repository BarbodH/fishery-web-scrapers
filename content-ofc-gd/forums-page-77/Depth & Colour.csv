1017714,OhioFisherman,2017-11-16 01:51:00,6623,I wonder what color chrome or gold turns to?
1017720,SirCranksalot,2017-11-16 04:08:00,3291,Kinda weird how red changes to blue! 
1017721,John Bacon,2017-11-16 04:33:00,3277,"Blue is the colour that is visiable in the least amount of light; red requires the most amount of light.  I think pure red would fade to black.   But if there was some blue tint in the red, the blue would remain visiable after the red had faded to black."
1017773,grimsbylander,2017-11-16 22:19:00,3016,That was interesting to see...the chartreuse and pink kind of maintained they colour and the rest went neutral. Even stranger was the concrete blocks lined up in a row like a foundation at 97'!!
1017806,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-17 05:43:00,8243,"That's what we see, what does the fish see? A bait seller told me fish are colour blind. He sold minnows not much tackle. It was very interesting to see that the pink didn't change much. But what does it tell us other than pink didn't change much to the Human eye."
1017819,SirCranksalot,2017-11-17 13:28:00,3291,"Your understanding of light is better (or maybe just different?) from mine. I didn't think one took more energy than the other, just that it's at a different frequency than the other. I guess, as you say, there must be a blue tint in there as well. Interesting, but don't see how it matters much for fishing, given that we are guessing at what color the fish will respond to at a given time and location."
1017821,Terry,2017-11-17 13:45:00,14456,Fish do see colours differently then we do so what colours you see is different then fish but to me it is not the colour or how deep you can see the colour as much as how much the profile of the bait stands out within its environment regardless of colour that makes the difference to me
1017835,manitoubass2,2017-11-17 17:53:00,11391,I'd like to see this in stained water
1017872,Fish Farmer,2017-11-18 11:03:00,2234,"Was this test done in salt water? L. Ont & Erie water at 100' is dark down there. They say Silver is best down deep, not chrome."
