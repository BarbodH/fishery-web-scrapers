1017761,BlueEye,2017-11-16 20:49:00,338,Yeah these shadow effects need to be fixed.... i'll look into this guys.  Thanks. 
1017767,aplumma,2017-11-16 21:30:00,6896,At the base of this page you will see the word theme in the middle. You can click it and it will give you 2 choices for now. If the wood one is hard to read you can click default and it will go to a black and white theme. You can switch back easily.  Art
1017768,Dutch01,2017-11-16 21:39:00,1431,Thank you!
1017769,SirCranksalot,2017-11-16 21:44:00,3291,Thx---that works. I prefer the blue on white.   Ha---I just noticed that I am now back to being Knuguy!! I guess I'll wait for the dust to settle to changing back to SirCranksalot!
1017777,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-16 22:28:00,8243,AKRISONER suggested I go to the theme option at the bottom middle of this page and select default. I now have a white background with black font. I won't go blind after all from reading here.
1017788,ketchenany,2017-11-17 00:14:00,3229,BLURRY to you is caused by what I call a “drop shadow” not used when Type is in text. get rid of the drop shadow and problem is solved with the black type.
1017789,misfish,2017-11-17 00:16:00,29133,"3 hours later into the night, I got this. My page went, ding dong. LMAO"
1017791,spincast,2017-11-17 00:22:00,3279,missin the status updates
1017794,Raf,2017-11-17 00:47:00,3495,"mobile theme please. i used that one whether i was on my phone or on PC before.  the black and white (""default"") is ok but the woody one is too much"
1017795,manitoubass2,2017-11-17 01:07:00,11391,"Also, says I have notification/ messages but when I click on it nothing happens???"
1017799,npt1,2017-11-17 01:43:00,220,"wow.  I have been trying for 2 days to post here. The text is dark--wonderful. Background is  very very distracting, please get  rid of it.  why change anything???? IT WAS GREAT THE WAY IT WAS. WHITE BACKGROUND, ADJUSTABLE ON  ANY SCREEN. DARK TEXT , WHY NOT STAY WITH  TRYED AND TRUE. I TOTALLY DISLIKE THIS ENITIRE NEW SKIN."
1017801,BlueEye,2017-11-17 02:07:00,338,"Hi guys - Thanks for feedback.  Wood theme will take some time and work until work out some of the finer details. npt1 - I agree.  Unfortunately our hand was forced because of the old software we were running.   IPB would no longer offer support of any kind and the entire site was in jeopardy unless we upgraded.  This meant the next time you saw one of the database errors, could have been the last if we didn't take action.  I'm one who believes in the ""if it's not broke, don't fix it"" model but the alternative here was we could lose the entire site.  Our hand was forced. At the bottom of the site you can change themes to a more basic version easily.  I'll continue to work on the short comings of this theme - I'm personally not a big fan of the text-shadow here; looks blurry to me. Stay tuned and thanks again for the patience everyone - Chad"
1017809,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-17 10:21:00,8243,"It's all good to me now that I changed from the ""wood"" background to white. If I can do it anyone can. All we need now is a ""Like"" and ""Dislike"" feature and lets see how others really feel, anonymously of course. Is this the time to make another forum like ""Waterside Chat"".?All non fishing subjects."
1017605,woodenboater,2017-11-14 19:18:00,2277,So couldn't access the site earlier today and eventually got onto the site but had to log in again. Now the skin I'm seeing is light blue and lighter colours overall. is it me or is this the new look OFC? Don't see a pulldown for different skin options. the banner is still green and gold coloured like the old style.
1017607,misfish,2017-11-14 19:32:00,29133,"They are going to try, but from what I read, it may not happen. Ya Im not a big fan of this one. Hard to see. Keep up the good work Blue"
1017610,Terry,2017-11-14 19:48:00,14456,I’m sure it will get better
1017614,BlueEye,2017-11-14 20:18:00,338,"Hi guys - I talked with the IPB team earlier, it was an ugly upgrade from some really old and outdated software.  They had to do a lot of error fixing and such.  The upgrade was completed, so now it is just a matter of fine-tuning out some details.   Hopefully within the next week or two here of working on it we can get things back to feeling somewhat normal.  I guess it is better than database errors every day ;-) Thanks for the patience as we work through this - 	Chad"
1017619,Terry,2017-11-14 20:41:00,14456,"got on the home computer, i find it hard to read with this skin"
1017622,ckewley,2017-11-14 20:54:00,699,"The skin I have is wood background, brown dialog boxes (trees faded on the right side) with green trim, looks great actually!"
1017626,DRIFTER_016,2017-11-14 21:07:00,10439,Me too. 
1017627,misfish,2017-11-14 21:09:00,29133,"I think I have my old glasses here some where,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
1017629,misfish,2017-11-14 21:13:00,29133,Hows this  can you see it now
1017654,woodenboater,2017-11-15 01:20:00,2277,"and in case anyone else is wondering, I think centre justified is default text formatting for posts. you can change it to left justified by selecting the icon that looks like a small pile of books (three piles to choose from haha)  and fwiw, I prefer the light blue vs this green and brown skin  "
1017655,TJQ,2017-11-15 03:29:00,7806,"There will definitety be bugs to work out,"
1017657,bigugli,2017-11-15 03:37:00,6138, I like the new wood skin. Now if only I could find n easier way to participate in the discussion
1017665,DJGeneral,2017-11-15 12:41:00,163,i love the new skin its pretty cool 
1017671,AKRISONER,2017-11-15 13:58:00,5558,shes a little too dark for my liking...if we could lighten the tones its gonna look great. Also whats with the centered type?
1017673,BlueEye,2017-11-15 14:19:00,338,I agree AKRISONER - I will work on these finer details in the days/weeks to come here once I take care of the bigger issues.  Thanks for the feedback and patience.
1017678,woodenboater,2017-11-15 15:53:00,2277,see my previous post. there's an option on that bar with the posting options . look for the three 'stack of books' (best way to describe it) choose the left one for left justified which places text at left and staggered right.
1017683,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-15 18:55:00,8243,My eyes are sore from reading on this new skin after only a few minutes. I'm sure I'm not te ly one.  I do like the notification when someone quotes you or replies to a thread you started. But this bronze background with white font  has to go. Not as bad with this dark font on the background but not much better.
1017723,porkpie,2017-11-16 07:59:00,2521,If you can bring back the mobile option that would be great.
1017725,dave524,2017-11-16 11:36:00,4508,The wood panelling looked nice but I am finding the one with the blue header and dark blue print on the white background far less strain on my old eyes.
1017726,ketchenany,2017-11-16 11:45:00,3229,Being in the type business reading white type does Affect the eyes. Ok for a short read but a Bunk report would kill .  
1017734,BillM,2017-11-16 16:19:00,17367,"First thing I did was change the 'Wood' themed skin, lol.    Now on a simple white setup."
1017742,Dutch01,2017-11-16 18:58:00,1431,How? I can't find any skin options....
1017747,manitoubass2,2017-11-16 19:22:00,11391,"I think it looks great! But when you quote someone I find it hard to read, like the font is shadowed or something??? Also +1 for the trees??????"
1017749,BillM,2017-11-16 19:52:00,17367,"Dutch, it's at the bottom of any of the forum pages.  Right in the middle....  "
1017753,misfish,2017-11-16 20:35:00,29133,You mean BLURRY ?  YUP
