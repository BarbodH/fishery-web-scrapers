1017724,mattyk,2017-11-16 11:26:00,2110,Howdy All Its been a while since I’ve posted anything. I’m still fishing as much as I can with three kids but busy with life. This past spring I’ve got into fly fishing for trout and really enjoy it. The kids really enjoy trout fishing. The state does a really nice job stocking trout here in the creeks. My son won a trout derby in the spring and he was so happy and got s big trophy. We did our annual two week trip to Nippissing and the fishing was a little slower then last year but we still caught a lot. We did really well on top water lures. We did a trip to the ocean and caught some flounder which was fun. We also fish one of the big east coast rivers for Shad and that was a lot of fun. Caught some interesting fish. Including some big flathead catfish and Asian snakeheads that are invasive species here.                                             
1017727,bobowski,2017-11-16 11:57:00,360,Great report. Was that a snakehead in one of the pics? Are they considered invasive down there? What do you do when you catch one?
1017728,bobowski,2017-11-16 11:59:00,360,Oops just read the last sentence of your report. I guess that Snakehead didn't go back?
1017730,bigugli,2017-11-16 12:02:00,6138,Great to see your kids enjoying fishing time with Dad.
1017732,mattyk,2017-11-16 12:16:00,2110,Bobowski  we are required to keep and kill them. I called the fisheries biologist and she instructed me on what do with it. ( checked for eggs).

Talk about a mixed bag this year. Same goes with I presume is your daughter, she is using all her muscles to hold up some of those Smallies.
