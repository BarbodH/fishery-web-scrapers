Retiring at a very young age, but it,s for the best for him. Be nice to see him go out with a win today, but not sure it,s going to happen. My moneys on Truex JR. My new fav driver is Chase Elliot. Kids the future. Alot of empty seat still at all the events this year. Nascar needs to look at racing with what the driver wants to bring. No governing. Let the racers race. Ya, wishful thinking, but sure would be more exciting, and would probably fill the seats. Happy retirement Dale and enjoy your days in your tree house. https://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/treehouse-masters/videos/dale-earnhardt-jr-gives-pete-a-tour-of-his-treehouse Grats on the owner of the year and top 3 drivers."

1017975,G.mech,2017-11-19 23:44:00,830,Just leaving Homestead Miami speedway and it was a great race as were the xfinity and truck races Friday and Saturday. Grandstands were pretty well full today and the energy of the fans was amazing as the race wound down.
