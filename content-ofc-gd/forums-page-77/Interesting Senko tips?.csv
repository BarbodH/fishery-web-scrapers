1017217,Supernewf71,2017-11-09 01:14:00,22,i am an avid senko user. its my go to bait for almost anything.
1017220,OhioFisherman,2017-11-09 01:24:00,6623,Just thought there was some interesting ideas in that video that maybe people hadn't seen.
1017221,Supernewf71,2017-11-09 01:26:00,22,good video
1017228,OhioFisherman,2017-11-09 01:53:00,6623,"Those guys have a pretty interesting youtube channel, given their location it is geared towards the bass fisherman but methods and techniques cross over."
1017265,fishindevil,2017-11-09 16:51:00,6254,"great video for sure,and they explain things great.....good tips too.....thanks for sharing"
1017266,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-09 17:42:00,8243,"Believe it or not I have never thrown a Senko. I know guys swear by them and they work. My B-I-L that never fished until he retired uses them and he catches some nice fish for a novice, for anyone really. Now that I have seen how to properly use them a pac of Yamamoto Senko's will be in my Christmas stocking, I hope. What are some ""go to"" colours for Smallies and Walleye?  Thanks for the link my Buckeye friend."
1017272,OhioFisherman,2017-11-09 18:41:00,6623,"No experience to speak of with them myself Old, I was already sick when they came out, and using what I had itself was a problem."

Thanks for the link my Buckeye friend.   Make sure to get a pack of white. They work with everything.  For me, for smallies green has worked well and blue. I know some people swear by pink but I have never used them."

1017286,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-09 22:00:00,8243,Thanks guys. I asked the fishing question where multiple answers will be given.What colour is best?
1017288,manitoubass2,2017-11-09 22:10:00,11391,"Three colours I use, black, white and pumpkin seed"
1017352,gordy28,2017-11-10 16:59:00,638,"IMO senkos are one of those baits you can't have enough colours - more than any other bait I have noticed one guy catching, other guy fishing due to senko colour If I had to pick favorites: Baby bass (green and white) Ragin Cajun - green pumpkin with red flake Black and blue  - called june bug a lot Pink"
1017364,jimmer,2017-11-10 20:27:00,2730,"Orange Pumpkin all the way,  a discontinued color of Root Beer was also very good."
