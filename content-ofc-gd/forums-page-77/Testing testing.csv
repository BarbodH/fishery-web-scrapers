1017616,BlueEye,2017-11-14 20:22:00,338,Thanks for the patience guys - site seems to be running really slow right now.  I think what is happening is the backend software is still updating many things so it might take a day or two until the speed ramps up a bit.  Still seems to be working fine though so far....
