Beautiful country. 21 minutes is a tad too long but at least it's not a 21 minute infomercial like most shows are now, otherwise good stuff. Keep them coming. Welcome aboard by the way. How about an intro from you guys.  I hope that's ginger ale in that Ale can in the boat, wink, wink. Nice to see you don't need 100K in boat, brand logos and electronics to catch good fish. I love the micro rigger. Reminds me of 2 buddies that used to carry the 12 footer and stuff over and around Beaver dams in back country many pounds of muscles ago.  edit: you got me to watch the whole thing, refreshing. Good to see you got the camera man in for a bit."
