Just wondered where we might be best to consider launching and parking?  I understand the fishing is reasonable all over the area.  We were thinking of using large gliding baits/jerkbaits for pike, and jigs/swimbaits for walleye.  Glad for any input. Thanks."

Had decent luck with #12 Huskey Jerks, and big Panther Marten Spinners.  For pickerel, I usually stick to the Wauboushene Channel / Port Severn area trolling a slow death rig near bottom, or a worm harness.  Really Really slow.  I've never had any luck jigging walleyes in the Sound.  It's a very large area, with tons of water, and a ridiculous amount of rocks and shaols.  Have fun out there, and be careful.  The water level was down a bunch the last few times I was out.  If you havn't already, give John a call.  He knows every back bay in the sound."
