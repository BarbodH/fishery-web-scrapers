703404,davey buoy,2012-06-06 20:47:00,5505," I hear you,still like your idea."
703411,jedimaster,2012-06-06 21:00:00,3472,"They put a tonne of RnD and engineering to bring the spool weight down as low as possible on purpose. Why on earth would I added twice the weight of line when the water will never touch that line. I mean think about it.... 50 yards of power pro is 150 is 150 feet. When the last time you were vertical jigging in 150 fow for bass? or perhaps take a monster cast halfway the length of a football field? Not likely.  jmho. I usually put a 150 yard spool split with 2 reals, and have some left over put about 30 feet or so of mono on first with 8-10 pound. also that line you are slipping onto the next reel backwards has been sitting getting damp and drying over and over  must be  causing some level of weakness over an entire season or two. I would rather just get fresh line when its time to change. Why not just keep the other 75 yards on the box tucked away clean and safe at home."
703412,redpearl99,2012-06-06 21:02:00,259,"just got some new 20 PowerPro, it still comes with the strips of foam backing"
703415,davey buoy,2012-06-06 21:10:00,5505," I understand what your saying,but were splitting hairs about the line.If I can get a season or two on a' on sale' line I'm too happy.It doesn't really matter does it?Who cares?.Your point is well taken,""again""."
703522,Stoty,2012-06-07 11:11:00,2910,If you like mono backing = great If you prefer duck tape = great If you tie directly to spool = great  Whatever floats your boat!
703547,Jacob,2012-06-07 12:01:00,186,"  There we go, logic.  Pick whatever suits you, i prefer mono backing, allowing me to fill two reels with one spool.  I try to get two seasons out of one spool but sometimes i find it starts to fray and end up cutting 10-20ft off the line in the begining of the season.  Jacob"
703589,jedimaster,2012-06-07 14:44:00,3472,"Oh yah, I am not arguing, Everyone does what they do. I have some reals that have lots of line on for sure, some of them I have powerpro tied on direct, but typically I'll put mono backer on and do a uni to uni knot."
703152,RickOnt,2012-06-05 21:44:00,669,"Yes, No, Maybe?  Other than using less PP any benefit?  Thanks Rick"
703154,davey buoy,2012-06-05 21:50:00,5505,"No,it's a bait caster.Just some tape on the reel to hold the first half wrap .Giver:thumbsup_anim:"
703155,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-05 21:51:00,10439,"No, you can use 2 wraps of electrical tape to keep the braid from spinning on the spool.  Here's a great Video on braid setup. This is for a spinning reel but it is no different for a bait caster."
703158,woodenboater,2012-06-05 22:10:00,2277,Power Pro should have included a strip of foam backers to prevent slip while loading line. Or you could use  couple of wraps of mono as well as tape as suggested above.
703172,bdox,2012-06-05 22:47:00,329,"I'm not sure if PowerPro stills comes with the foam backing stickers, but I always used one and an arbor knot and never had a problem."
703174,woodenboater,2012-06-05 22:56:00,2277,A piece of cloth bandage would do as well.
703180,pike slayer,2012-06-05 23:31:00,1177,i just spool it up no issues.
703183,uglyfish,2012-06-05 23:34:00,981,"If the spool is drilled, or whiffled, just tie the line through one of the holes, and u won't have any problems with the line slipping on the spool.  Having said that, keeping good tension on the spool of line when u spool up with also prevent line from slipping. Most ppl that run into the problem of line slipping on the spool, are not spooling the reel properly."
703184,JamesG,2012-06-05 23:35:00,32,"I like to fill almost half the spool with mono then tie the braid on, that way i can spool 2 reels with one 150yard spool."
703185,davey buoy,2012-06-05 23:38:00,5505, Do they call that cheap or thrifty?:whistling:I buy it on sale and put the 150yards on each reel.Usually get about two seasons on each reel.Not bad.
703186,uglyfish,2012-06-05 23:41:00,981,"Another option, should u use all braid and no backing... U typically don't get down past half way on the spool, when its time to respool, u can just tie that line onto a different reel, and reel it on. Then the old line is backing, and u have new line to fish with, get the use outta the whole spool of line."
703189,backbay,2012-06-05 23:55:00,773,"I reversed a spool last year, like ugly said, simply by tying on to a new reel. it works great."
703190,RickOnt,2012-06-05 23:57:00,669,Spool is drilled.  Uglyfish  I like that idea!  Rick
703191,davey buoy,2012-06-06 00:02:00,5505, Me too!!!
703208,hooked!,2012-06-06 01:39:00,38,"I tried that on a curado and the edges of the drilled holes were so sharp it cut 10lb power pro.  At first I thought the line had a weak spot, but I tried it a second time with the same result.  I used a couple wraps of mono."
703229,uglyfish,2012-06-06 05:31:00,981," 10lb braid is way to light of line to be throwing on a baitcaster. Typically 20lb and up on baitcasters, but I generally don't go lighter then 30lb braid on a baitcaster."
703243,MCTFisher9120,2012-06-06 11:01:00,3761,"Tie your braid to some mono and take 5 or 6 handle turns onto your spool or use some duck tape and use straight braid. I have 15lb PP on one baitcaster, works real well...it's addicting light braids."
703250,Fish4Eyes,2012-06-06 11:46:00,1022,I would put on mono backing to use less of the power pro which is way more expensive. The first bit of line you spool on never really gets used anyways so it would be a waste of power pro.
703255,Joeytier,2012-06-06 11:56:00,3990,"How about smart?  With the price of braid, there's no point in filling the hole spool, especially when targetting fish where long runs are a non-issue.  I always fill the quarter of my spool with whatever 8-10 lb mono i have lying around."
703293,Pangle,2012-06-06 13:57:00,64," I do this as well.  I find 150 yds of PP does not fill the entire spool, therefore i use mono as backing.  Also, I have never had a fish (exception: salmon, trout) rip out 75 yrds of line.  When the braid becomes faded and frayed, I put it on another reel and use the other end........brand new line."
703372,davey buoy,2012-06-06 19:21:00,5505," I never even thought about changing the line. I buy a spool for $14 bucks and use it two seasons,what a steal.Now I can reverse the line back on another for another two years.Joeytier that's what I call thrifty!!!!!!!.Smart as well,thanks for the tips."
703373,davey buoy,2012-06-06 19:26:00,5505," My bait casters,I get to the point where I'm not sure it is going to fit but it just does.What reel do you have?.I have or using 30lb on all reels except the round bait caster that I put 50lb on."
703384,jedimaster,2012-06-06 19:52:00,3472,"I use mono backer, and since I fish for bass and have NEVER been spooled on bass, I only put enough line on so that the line sits just past level with the center of the reel line guide. This helps reduce friction when casting as well less line means less weight means a faster spool means longer casts."
703396,davey buoy,2012-06-06 20:14:00,5505," H!mmmmm,you haven't fished where I have. You never know what you might get.Like your idea."
703401,jedimaster,2012-06-06 20:44:00,3472,"I have caught some big fish while bass fishing, and with 30 pound braid and  and the drag power of most bait casters even a good size musky  will be able to be horsed in before it spools 75 yards."
