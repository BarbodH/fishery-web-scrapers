702515,mirogak,2012-06-03 23:30:00,387,"Time to give some attention to local lakes and Walleye fishing.  Got the boat out, cleaned it, put the water muffs on, made sure all pipes are connected, and gave it a start, it started but then some smoke started coming out.  Thinking I'll show it to my mechanic tomorrow but wondering if this is normal.  I did have it winterized last fall.  It has a 2-stroke 1986 70 HP Evinrude on it.  What do you think?   "
702517,davey buoy,2012-06-03 23:33:00,5505,"I wouldn't worry much,it's probably the fogging oil just burning off.Mine does that for a bit every year.Nice boat!!!"
702520,BillM,2012-06-03 23:40:00,17367,Fogging oil most likely burning off..
702521,Skipper D,2012-06-03 23:40:00,1970,"x 2 , let it run till it burns it all off , then it will be fine ."
702522,mirogak,2012-06-03 23:44:00,387,"Awesome, 3 similar answers... Fogging oil it is, i'll burn it off tomorrow.  Hopefully I'll have good weather this coming weekend. Miro"
702542,SlowPoke,2012-06-04 00:44:00,2984,Smoking is the least of your worries; where's your hull registration numbers?
702634,Billy Bob,2012-06-04 11:53:00,5865,On that VRO motor when the gas line is disconnected and the gas is run out of the carbs the computer senses that and starts to pump raw oil into the motor......so it could be that or fogging oil......both are normal.
702965,mirogak,2012-06-05 04:05:00,387, They are on the back of the boat
702977,krixxer,2012-06-05 10:41:00,274,"I started to run SeaFoam in my gas, since then my 88 50hp Evinrude always puffs some smoke on morninig startup. Smoke is just a way for the ol motors to say hello, I'm still alive."
702978,Roy,2012-06-05 10:51:00,13728," You must display the licence number on both sides of the bow, above the water line, in block characters that are at least 7.5 centimetres (3 inches) high and in a colour that contrasts with the colour of the bow. Displaying on the back of the boat is the same as not having them on there at all. I'd really like to see a pic of a registration number on the back of a boat. I've never seen that."
702980,Billy Bob,2012-06-05 10:52:00,5865, But Roy.......what if he only back trolls all the time........
702999,Fisherman,2012-06-05 11:45:00,7201, Stand by for your early morning smack with a 2 x 4.
703004,Billy Bob,2012-06-05 11:46:00,5865, You're too late......wifey did that already.....
703009,Fish4Eyes,2012-06-05 11:52:00,1022,"It sounds like fogging oil. Run it on the muffs for about 10minutes. If it continues to smoke I would say its more than fogging oil. My motor usually smokes for about 1-2 minutes after start up the first time in the season. It will smoke if your on the throttle, but should smoke very little, if at all on idle."
703010,Stoty,2012-06-05 11:53:00,2910,You should really tell your engine to quit... it's a nasty habit!
703217,mirogak,2012-06-06 03:12:00,387," Okay - now I remember this is the first boat I ever bought.  When I first got it, my younger brother wanted to remove all the stickers and put some new fancy colored ones.  He started peeling that serial number on the one side of the hull but that's when I pointed out to him that its probably not a good idea.  Long story short, I have the number on one side of the boat and not the other.  But there are some other numbers engraved in the back of the boat next to the transom.  Not sure what those are.  If I remember it, I will take some pics and post here.  Ciao Miro  PS: thx for the heads up ... you think I'll get a ticket for it if its missing on one side?"
703218,mirogak,2012-06-06 03:15:00,387," Yes, I ran it today for about 5 minutes and all the smoke disappeared.... thanks.  Was gonna take it out for a ride on Lake O but apparently I can't locate the plug that I took out.  So need to pay a vist to the mechanic nonetheless... bummer."
703223,mirogak,2012-06-06 03:30:00,387, I got curious ... here is that number     and that number in the back of the boat ... guess its not the hull registration number   
703224,BFSC Kevin,2012-06-06 03:46:00,1351,The numbers on the back is the HIN. Similar to a car and its VIN. The numbers on the side is the registration number. It should be on both sides of the boat
703647,jimmer,2012-06-07 18:18:00,2730,"Yes, you can get ticketed for that, but usually on larger/busier waterbodies is where you get hit."
703655,Pigeontroller,2012-06-07 18:50:00,2793,"Just like you need plates front and back on your car/truck, you need the reg numbers on both sides of the bow, easy fix...Get new stick-on numbers, put then on yourself."
703659,smally21,2012-06-07 19:00:00,993,"if i was to hazard a guess, these numbers that your brother were peeling off would still show the previous owners name if processed..  apologies if you have applied to place the numbers into your name already. just gettin' a feeling...."
703663,davey buoy,2012-06-07 19:18:00,5505,There you go!
