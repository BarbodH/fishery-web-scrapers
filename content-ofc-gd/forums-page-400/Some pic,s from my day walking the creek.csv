702460,misfish,2012-06-03 19:27:00,29133,"At the creek by 6am. Plan was to walk about 4 km down. Boy has the forest growth gotten big in a short time. It was a bit of a trek, I have to say. I managed two small smolts. One a brown,the other a rainbow. I didnt bother with pics of them.Thought I would share some of the spots I fished.   Missed a nice fish at this spot.    Got my first one here today.    Picked the brown out of here.    Nice spot that didnt hand over a fish.      This I thought was a nice pic.Spring feed feeder.    Lost 3 flies today.Darn those over hanging branches.   Still nice to be getting out      Time for a snack and rest.Yep,slice of cold pizza and a drink.    Thought a fishless post,was needed.LOL"
702462,BillM,2012-06-03 19:36:00,17367,Looks like some gorgeous water man!!  Go back in the evenings if you want topwater dry action.
702464,Spiel,2012-06-03 19:37:00,9065,That is some sweet looking water Brian.  While I grew up on fly fishing and love it some of those spots would be best attacked with a hair jig on a short spinning rod.  Thanks for the pictures.
702465,misfish,2012-06-03 19:42:00,29133," Thanks Bill.Im sure you know this water as well as I do,if not, better. The skitters were a be atcha.I can amagine what they would be like at the night bite.  Still worth a try though.Let me know if you can make it out one afternoon."
702467,misfish,2012-06-03 19:44:00,29133,"  I have some hair jigs Chris.I didnt use them.I thought maybe they were to big. Think I had them in my hand, more then three or four times."
702469,danc,2012-06-03 19:53:00,4677,Just a beautiful creek Brian. I'll bet that you really enjoyed the solitude out there today.   Here's a pic from my day for ya.  
702470,Joey,2012-06-03 19:54:00,9122,"Great pics B.  Those look like some sweet spots.  Da boyz only picked up a few dink perch so no whities once again, but at least they got out"
702472,misfish,2012-06-03 20:02:00,29133,"  It,s so peacefull Dan   Oh,this guy is closing in,,,,,,,,,,,     Not sure where that SMOKE guy is,,,,,,,,,,,"
702473,misfish,2012-06-03 20:07:00,29133, Thanks J.  They didnt have the mojo.
702474,BillM,2012-06-03 20:10:00,17367," Absolutely, let's wait for a sunny say..  We should definitely have some bugs hatching later in the afternoon if that's the case.  I'm pretty much free all this week (Coming up)"
702477,Terry,2012-06-03 20:17:00,14456,hey we had Mo and Jo just no fish in simcoe..LOL  looks like you are getting the hang of that fly fishing stuff
702478,Ralph Field,2012-06-03 20:23:00,1018,"Nice looking water, braving the skitters ypu deserved more. The walking doesn't look easy either."
702479,davey buoy,2012-06-03 20:25:00,5505,"Way to go Brian!!!,I just need to get to a park and practice. The water sure looks good!!"
702480,mercman,2012-06-03 20:31:00,7054,Great looking piece of nature Brian Relaxs me just looking at it
702483,lew,2012-06-03 20:34:00,12766,"A fun day with some great pictures Brian, thanks for that."
702488,Musky or Specks,2012-06-03 21:04:00,2710,You keep fishing water/cover like that your going to become a very technically sound caster in a short time. Or keep commercial tyers very busy
702494,Broker,2012-06-03 21:19:00,482,Those are some awesome shots
702510,mirogak,2012-06-03 22:54:00,387,"You're hooked on the fly, my friend.  Good for you.  Fly fishing is probably the only type of fishing where despite not having caught anything or having caught little ones, you can still come out satisfied from the trip.  Good point Brad made, your casting skills will only refine.  I was deterred by the heavy rainfall the past few days and didn't hit any streams this weekend.  i will catch up soon.  Miro"
702519,mbac31,2012-06-03 23:38:00,904,Youve come a long way Mr Brian. At least your not seein visions in roots anymore.
702528,MJL,2012-06-04 00:04:00,2427,Just incredible looking water Brian. Great pics  It's been a while since I last broke out the fly rod for trout...Hopefully next weekend the fish will be rising for me
702609,Cudz,2012-06-04 04:36:00,2652,"Looks nice. Looks familiar but I may be wrong.  If it is the same creek I am thinking (I used to fish it more as a kid), there are decent browns but man are they skiddish (sp?). You have got make 0 noise and cast from a distance."
702639,John,2012-06-04 12:05:00,2956," You guys are starting to make me feel nostalgic.......Used to fish dozens of spots like that in my teens with an UL 5' rod a 2 1/2"" fly reel loaded with 2# line and a size 16 eyeless hook and a tiny redworm."
703031,fish_finder,2012-06-05 13:12:00,370,"Lookin like some real nice water!  One thing I'd recommend.... If you plan on continuing with the bushwhacking, get yourself a thermacell and strap it to your belt or backpack.  You won't see any bugs for miles doing that"
703063,misfish,2012-06-05 15:24:00,29133, Thanks FF. I will be looking at them. Im sure the evening bite is worst the the morning.
