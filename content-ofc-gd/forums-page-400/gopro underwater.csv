702818,BillM,2012-06-04 19:51:00,17367,You can still get aftermarket lenses for them (They've been around for a while because of the underwater focusing issue with the previous model)
702819,Terry,2012-06-04 19:53:00,14456,"yeah I have one of the aftermarket ones..but it fogs up   <a href=""http://s27.photobucket.com/albums/c177/Mrtbeee/?action=view&current=DSCF4387.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c177/Mrtbeee/DSCF4387.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"

702826,bigreddog,2012-06-04 20:15:00,84,"Interesting that your Snake River housing fogs. I assume that it's inside the housing and not in the add-on lens assembly?  If that's the case, then maybe you should try stuffing a small bag of desiccant inside the housing along with the camera (although it's probably a very tight fit).  If it's happening in the lens assembly, then you should swap out the white desiccant balls for a fresh set, or at least dry out the ones you have. GoPro also has their own Anti-Fog Insert solution.  The new GoPro housing will probably have fogging issues as well. Best thing to do is to put the camera in the housing in a cool and dry environment."
702837,Terry,2012-06-04 21:03:00,14456,the Snake River lens has desiccant beads the problem lies with the 55mm lens.. the threads do let in a bit f water at times when over 60 ft of water and it's just enough to screw things up
702961,Stoty,2012-06-05 03:40:00,2910,Niiice! I've been debating getting one of those...might have to take the plunge!
