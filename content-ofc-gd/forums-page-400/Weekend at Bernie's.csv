703120,fishnsled,2012-06-05 19:43:00,3520,"  :rofl2:  HEY!!! I'm getting 40% of that app......OK 25%  Thanks Bernie - great time as always. Last weekend I had the photographer with me so there will be lots of pics without any fish from this past weekends adventure, anything that could go wrong likely like did as you know. Report to come via CCMT."
703146,Christopheraaron,2012-06-05 20:51:00,3525,Nice report! What was that first fish?
703147,Bitsmith2k,2012-06-05 21:05:00,396, it was a goat.. we cleaned it and used it's eyes to catch the other fish.. almost as good as musky eyes but not quite.. 
703280,Headhunter,2012-06-06 13:20:00,5703,"I believe that I am inline for a% of that app... heck, I'm the the Q/A UAT on that thing! Actually, filming the UAT might prove to be worth a chuckle! ""There's no business, like show business..."" Can't help but think of Ethel Merman when ever I see Will now! LMAO HH"
701407,fishnsled,2012-05-31 04:14:00,3520,"Our annual spring trip to Bernie's has come and gone once again. It was great to see everyone but too bad that a couple of the usual suspects couldn't make it, you were missed Cliff and Gerritt. Stepping up to fill the void this trip was Bitsmith2K. We arrived safe and sound but greeted with some crazy winds. After unpacking and catching up, we presented Bernie with his new Spiel creation, a custom walleye jigging rod that we all pitched in on. It was great to give a little something back to the man that has been such a great host over the years. Thanks again Bernie.   With Cliff (AKA - our photographer) missing, there were not too many shots taken over the weekend but I managed a couple for the report. Friday evening was a pretty good fish with a few walleyes brought back to join our steak dinner the following evening - no pictures so I guess they don't count. I can tell you that they were delicious!! Saturday I was better with the camera and grabbed a few more shots. Started out the day with Bernie's favourite species.   Followed by some of these pesky things. Those Sworming Hornet jigs work well Phil!!     What a monster!!     A bit of a slow bite in the morning but even slower in the afternoon.   After a nice steak and walleye dinner it was back on the water to see about getting a few more in the boat. A couple of eaters and some perch for both boats and ended with an awesome sunset.  Nice shirt Joe!    Brook joined them and was an extra set of eyes on the rod.           The next morning the weather cooperated and we gave it one last go. Mike and I had a great morning with a bit of everything coming in the boat. This walleye looking to be the very same fish I had caught the day before. Exact location, and the exact same markings, just wished I had a pic from the day before to confirm.   A couple of minutes later Mike hooks into what could have been causing the damage to my fish,   A few more walleye were caught along with some perch and one other surprise.       After a good morning fish it was time head back and start the dreaded packing for the trip home. Another awesome weekend in the books. Thanks again Bernie for putting up with us  's again. Fantastic time as always!"
701427,Terry,2012-05-31 09:39:00,14456,"as always it sounds like a great time at ""Weekend at Bernie's"" too bad a couple of the guys couldn't make it "
701429,kickingfrog,2012-05-31 09:55:00,8333,Classy move.

701479,Harrison,2012-05-31 12:59:00,2202," Awesome Will, getting some amazing feedback on the swormiong hornets!  Pike are destroying the 1/2 oz as well.  Love the shirt!"
701481,Headhunter,2012-05-31 13:11:00,5703,"Thanks for putting up the report Will... I'm surprised you can even see me with the way that shirt blends into the background! I never knew Bitsmith could smile! LMAO A good time was had, great to see Spiel again and as always, I'm humbled by Bernie's generosity. We had the camera in the boat, but lacked any inspriation to get it out and actually use it! I knew there was a reason why we brought CLiff along! HH"
701517,Spiel,2012-05-31 14:51:00,9065,"It was a great weekend (as always) and being there with y'all is just what I needed.  I had a good time, right? "

701536,fishnsled,2012-05-31 15:48:00,3520,"Thanks for the replies!   Classy move for a classy guy.   Me or the fish??   I've got some ideas for those baits this weekend, we'll chat when I see you tonight. We still need to plan for a crazy shirt fishing day with Joe too!    We all had a great time! lol!    Who are you again??      Or......Joe, if you take the 9 out of the run, you still have your 8 for the phase...."
701538,Spiel,2012-05-31 15:51:00,9065," Oh ya, that led to several minutes of uncontrollable laughing, ""DOH!""  ...."
701547,Headhunter,2012-05-31 16:17:00,5703,"it's a well known fact that I have significant trouble counting past ten, after 10:00pm... who brought that dirty rotten vodka anyway???? Sorry, I know a ""Jill Terapoopa"", not a CLiff! LMAO HH"
701588,ccmtcanada,2012-05-31 18:35:00,7971,Lol Joe!  You leave Jill out of this!!!

701719,Bernie,2012-06-01 00:26:00,3190,"Good job on the report Will.  You fellows are always welcome here. Thank you so much for your thoughtfulness. The Spiel fishing rod is a thing of beauty. Light, sensitive and  I think it will handle a big fish, if I ever get one....  We are going to have to get a simpler game to play after 10pm."
701744,Fish Farmer,2012-06-01 01:56:00,2234,Sounds like you guys had a great time. Chris told me about it. Nice picture shots. Chris offered me some protection on our annual trip next week    I'm going with 8 guys.
701839,Headhunter,2012-06-01 13:47:00,5703, Watch out for the spikey one! I don't know Bernie... either find a differnet game to play after ten or find some smarter friends! HH
701840,Spiel,2012-06-01 13:50:00,9065," I hear it's a good game if you play it fast, we'll never know!   "

Trying to figure out what the scarier sleeping situation is: Gerritt's demonic threats, or Will's humming show tunes in his sleep..    thanks god it wasnt the goose picture..   no need for simpler games Bernie, i'm building an app for this kind of thing.. i call it ""things to do when you're drunk"", and i thought of the idea all by myself with no outside help..   Will, I truely wish the best for you and Joe and I'm sorry we couldn't make things work out.. you'll always have a special place in my heart..  Mike"
