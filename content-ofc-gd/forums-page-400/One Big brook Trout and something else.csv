702512,mirogak,2012-06-03 23:16:00,387,How come the Brookie has such vibrant colors this time of the year?  Isn't that supposed to happen in the fall?  I am looking at the marked white lines around the reddish fins.
702513,BillM,2012-06-03 23:17:00,17367," They are always coloured up, even more in the fall."
702605,ehg,2012-06-04 03:39:00,2666,Have caught thousands of browns. They have red spots. http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v615/shiffy/?action=view&current=biggestbrown.jpg  Main difference is mouth size. Scroll down for differences. http://www.fishcreeksalmon.org/atlantic-salmon-id.htm
702607,BillM,2012-06-04 03:51:00,17367,I've caught a few Lake O browns which have zero red on them.
702662,johnnyb,2012-06-04 13:02:00,3413,Those are a pair of gorgeous fish!!!!  I'm amazed at how fast that brookie is growing....hope it got released close to the brown....in a few years maybe someone will pull a tiger out
702665,jigsnreels,2012-06-04 13:13:00,133,"Pretty decent throw-in.  :-)  Browns are still on my to-catch list, that one's a beauty..."
702726,troutologist,2012-06-04 15:25:00,951,Very nice catches. Another fella I know from T Bay caught a brown in the Nip this weekend as well.
702738,Steve,2012-06-04 15:56:00,2075,"anglers on OFC are similar to the MNR - wanting to believe everything is an atlantic.  I'm sure the bio will reply back to the OP, and will confirm."
702789,BillM,2012-06-04 17:34:00,17367,"If that's an Atlantic, it must have one hell of a vertical jump to make it in from the big lake."
702932,Dabluz,2012-06-05 02:12:00,701," I also say it's an Atlantic salmon.  Here where I live, we catch a lot of landlocked Atlantic salmon and they ressemble the one in the photo.....when caught in a river system.  Out on a large lake, they are silver coloured."
702952,BillM,2012-06-05 02:51:00,17367," If you knew where this fish was caught, there is absolutely no possible chance it made it up from Lake Superior.  Seeing that someone else caught a brown on that same river system in the same week, I think brown trout is the easy choice.  Will be interesting to see what with the MNR comes back with though after seeing the picture."
702098,Guidofisherman,2012-06-02 01:01:00,206,"Finally got my brook trout fix with this nice sized fish. Almost 24"" and 7 lbs. it was originally tagged in '08 at 16"". Sure grew some!    First time I ever caught one of these others however. Is it a brown? There are a few historical reports of browns in the Nipigon, but very, very rare.  "
702100,salmon,2012-06-02 01:14:00,334,Nice brookie and brownie
702101,misfish,2012-06-02 01:18:00,29133,"Lard tunderun,does are some nice fish."
702102,BillM,2012-06-02 01:19:00,17367,That is definitely a brown!!  I'm sure a huge surprise up there!
702104,hoby5,2012-06-02 01:26:00,42,thats a brute of a brookie and a nice brown as well ..not a bad surprise at all ;0
702117,dave524,2012-06-02 02:49:00,4508,"I'm on the fence, snout is a little pointy and the jaw appears to end at the eyeball rather than extending beyond it. Would it be too early for an Atlantic to enter a river up there? They are at the Soo, is it possible to travel to this location? The Brookie is awesome too"
702121,Christopheraaron,2012-06-02 03:11:00,3525,"Looks like a definite brown, however I agree the lip looks a little short."
702124,Musky or Specks,2012-06-02 03:43:00,2710,Brown probably dropped out of the Arrow and back up into the Nip. They do put a lot of Browns into the Arrow
702128,Dozer,2012-06-02 03:56:00,896,ITS A BRO-LANTIC!
702129,danc,2012-06-02 04:05:00,4677, Not a chance of that happening. I know where Al caught this fish and it's impossible for an Arrow Brown to get to where it was caught.
702131,Musky or Specks,2012-06-02 04:14:00,2710,Okay I just figured it was lower river. Must be either bucket brigade stocker or remnant from some forgotten population.
702158,MJIG,2012-06-02 12:23:00,227," In the last week or so, someone posted an MNR link to an atlas of self-sustaining Brown Trout populations in Ontario. The link was Self-sustaining Brown Trout Populations.  Nipigon is in that list."
702285,Joeytier,2012-06-02 23:27:00,3990,"Wow, that speck is a monster, and a beautiful brownie to boot."
702294,ehg,2012-06-02 23:45:00,2666,Thinking Atlantic as first instinct as well.  Nice big Brook Trout.
702295,danc,2012-06-02 23:51:00,4677,"First of all, awesome Brookie Al. As impressive as it is, I'm more intrigued by the Brown. I've been trout fishing in this area practically my entire life and I've never even seen, never mind caught, a Brown. There are a few historical mentions of Browns caught in the Nipigon system, including the lake, but how they got there I haven't a clue. A rare catch up here for sure. Congrats Al."
702298,ehg,2012-06-03 00:06:00,2666," Judging by large size of spotting,lack of red spots and jaw position and length. I feel safe to assume it's an Atlantic salmon."
702299,Joeytier,2012-06-03 00:09:00,3990,It's a brown.    I've also never caught a brown with red spots? [when not in spawning mode]
702306,danc,2012-06-03 00:51:00,4677,  It would be impossible for a Lake Superior fish to be where Al caught this fish.
702310,Guidofisherman,2012-06-03 01:17:00,206,"Thanks everyone for your comments. While the Brookie was a treat to catch, the brown was a real surprise. As Dan said, these fish are very rare up here, especially where I caught it. I have sent the photo off to the  Nipigon biologist. Hopefully he can shed some light on this rarity."
702330,Moosebunk,2012-06-03 02:33:00,3970,It's all just world-class awesome to me.  Great fishes Al!!!  You get my mojo rising for some speckled brook char.
702341,Carp,2012-06-03 03:01:00,1488,Sweet fish !!!  Congrats and thanks for sharing.
702348,spinnerbaitking,2012-06-03 03:36:00,1622,"Very nice indeed, Congrats on your catches, Brown has my vote Tight Lines SBK"
702421,Jacob,2012-06-03 15:40:00,186,"Wow, nice fish."
702427,Broker,2012-06-03 16:33:00,482,"I would say its a brown, and whatta beauty it is!!"
702431,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-06-03 16:45:00,310,Looks like a brownie to me.  That speck is a beauty!!!
