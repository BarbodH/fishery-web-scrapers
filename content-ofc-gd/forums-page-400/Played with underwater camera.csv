703697,mike rousseau,2012-06-07 20:24:00,4661,Went out for walleye yesterday...  And since I was flying solo I thought I would bring the underwater camera to play around a bit...  First spot I hit I got 5 walleye in 5 trolls then nothing... So I figured I should drop the camera to see if I could spot any...  As soon as the camera made it to the bottom... It was swarmed by smallmouth bass... The entire drift they were circling the camera and bumping it... It was pretty cool to see... I wasn't able to spot any walleye with it yesterday but lots of smallies and a few big suckers...  The camera was the cheapie from cabelas and the picture was pretty good... It was only $80 on sale...Only issue is the tv display is hard to see in the sunlight....    Finished the day with 11 walleye and 5-6 oos smallmouth boated and a handful of dropped fish...  And luckily the rain never got me...  All in all a great day on the water

703707,mike rousseau,2012-06-07 20:36:00,4661,Not sure if this unit can even record Paul... I know there is a Seperate piece for aqua view but I don't know if that'll work on my cabelas camera... Or if I even have the ports...

703787,mike rousseau,2012-06-08 01:09:00,4661,  Lmao  And it's not even one that's shaped like a fish...lol
