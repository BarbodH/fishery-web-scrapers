703269,Miracon,2012-06-06 12:34:00,200,"So glad to have a sec to pop in! Now I know what I'm getting Rob for Father's Day! But, no kids allowed!  Haha! This looks like a fantastic deal!  Steal the Deal "
703274,johnnyb,2012-06-06 13:01:00,3413,"Great idea, I would love to receive a day of fishing....only downside I see to this is that an hour will go by really fast  "
703275,Snidley,2012-06-06 13:02:00,620,Careful of the small print. That's a 1 hour outing. Depending on when and where that might easily end in a  $50 boat ride and no fish.
703277,jigsnreels,2012-06-06 13:04:00,133,That better be a really fast boat.
703288,Miracon,2012-06-06 13:38:00,200,"Haha! Thanks for the advice! I did see it was only 1 hour.  But as people with no means to get on the water, even an hour is worth it! And just like I know I'm going to win the lottery with every ticket I buy...I'm also going to catch a really big fish in that hour!!"
703291,BillM,2012-06-06 13:47:00,17367,"If that hour starts from the time you leave the dock, you'll be doing about 25mins of fishing...  GroupOn and the rest of those deal sites have gone downhill."
703294,asdve23rveavwa,2012-06-06 14:04:00,2690,"You'd be better off putting out a ""feeler"" on this board, offering to split gas/trip costs.  Like the others have stated, one hour is waaaaaaaaay too short."
703299,torco,2012-06-06 14:36:00,656,You would get better value booking a charter for half day with 4 friends. I realize this says 3 people for 1 hr and $49 bucks but I have to think you will be disappointed with only an hour on the water.
703322,SmokestackLightnin,2012-06-06 15:35:00,390, It says you can buy a max of 5. Why not purchase 4 and that 1 hour of fishing just turned into 4 hours of fishing.
703328,Miracon,2012-06-06 15:47:00,200,"Actually, you guys are right.  I wasn't thinking about it too well.  I just saw fishing in one of the Daily Deals and got excited!  There's a lot of opportunities, I'll keep my eyes open! Plus, we're thinking about looking into finding a used small alum boat, motor and trailer. So might not have to worry! Haha!  Thanks everyone for pointing out what should have been obvious! Haha!"
703357,Acountdeleted,2012-06-06 18:13:00,2562,"  I just bought a 12 foot fishing kayak from paddle shack and I have to say, I already think its a better investment then a 12 aluminum boat plus motor. I'm able to strap it to my car, carry it solo on my back, there is easily enough room to fit 2 more people, its stable enough to stand in, and it even fits my electric trolling motor.  I was all about doing the same as you, small aluminum, small motor and a trailer but after this purchase I think I'll be saving my pennies for something else. Check em out."
