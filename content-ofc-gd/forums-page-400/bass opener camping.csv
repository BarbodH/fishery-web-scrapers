702455,Jer,2012-06-03 18:27:00,1426,"I've been informed I have to vacate my house on the bass opener weekend (June 23) due to a ""girl's weekend"".  My buddy and I would like to camp somewhere for the weekend preferrably on a smaller lake somewhere in North Kawartha or Haliburton to keep it a reasonable drive from home (Bridgenorth area). We will be tenting it but would also need dockage and a launch for my 16' boat. Hydro & water on-site would be nice but not necessary. We camped once at Limerick Lake Lodge and they had a decent set-up but they have nothing available that weekend.  Most parks, it seems, are really geared to the seasonal trailer camper and not so much for the ""transient"" weekend camper anymore.  Anybody have any suggestions? PM is fine if you have a ""secret gem"" not to be advertised world-wide."
702459,Jer,2012-06-03 19:12:00,1426,"Maybe I posted in haste. Booked a spot, looking forward to fishing a different lake on opener for a change, though I have fished the lake once before in late summer."

702683,johnnyb,2012-06-04 13:44:00,3413,So...?  Where did you book?  
702808,Jer,2012-06-04 18:42:00,1426,Found a spot on Eels Lake north of Apsley.
702809,jigsnreels,2012-06-04 18:47:00,133, Ain't that a darned shame.
702810,crappieperchhunter,2012-06-04 18:51:00,2582,  I hope you had the good sense to negotiate something extra out of this. If not I think you should be turning in your man card
702864,Jer,2012-06-04 22:18:00,1426,  More chance of losing my man card if I stick around for the weekend...
702894,Acountdeleted,2012-06-04 23:56:00,2562,Its too late now but I would have said to go for Balsam provincal park. That way you can tell me how the camp sites are for when I go later this year.

The last 2 years it's been held here so both times I packed my  suitcase and spent the weekend in the local hotel & restaurants.  Expensive, but well worth every penny just for my own sanity"
