Ive never been in a boat with a top installed. Do they fold up or down to get out of the way? Ive tried looking up some but didnt find much for my model of boat. Ive seen on Lunds people install it onto the sport trak system. Only reason why i ask, is that i primarily cast and see it being a nuisance.  If i do decide to get a quote, anyone recommend a few places that do good work?  Thanks"
703362,Pikeslayer,2012-06-06 18:25:00,1443,I am still very happy with the work Greg did for me 2 years ago.  http://www.coversunl...d.ca/index.html  He's in Brampton  Slayer
703364,Rich Clemens,2012-06-06 18:34:00,3131,"We had one custom made for our boat.  It is four hand-screws to attach to the inside of the boat.  When not in use, we remove the 4 screws and it lays down along the back of the boat, right in front of the motor and is out of the way.   If we know we will not need it, we can just lift it out of the boat completely.    If it is up, it can be a pain casting from the back - and trolling.  (At least for the way ours is configured).  Good thing is, we really only use it on real hot days or when it's raining."

When down, don't even know it's there  Folds down and out of the way. Doesnt get in the way for trolling for me, and I used mine as a basis for a stand up - which is great in April weather or in the rain. Its definitely nice on those hot July afternoons to be able to sit in the shade and troll. Given what you have offered - I'd say go for it. My stand up was done by convertaboat out of the Tillsonburg area - very happy with the product and a very reasonable price. google will get you there  edited for spelling"
