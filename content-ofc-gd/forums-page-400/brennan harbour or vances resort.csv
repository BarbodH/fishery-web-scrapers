702841,Bob,2012-06-04 21:19:00,370,What do you wish to fish for? Do you want to fish the river or the big water? What size boat? Vance's is up the river a bit and gives qutck access to the river. Brennan Harbour is in a bay outside the river mouth off the Whalesback Channel and gives a little quicker access to the bigger water. I've never stayed at either but they both seem to be decent camps.
702849,tomO,2012-06-04 21:39:00,363,"I'll be fishing the river , I'm thinking there would be islands close to the shore on the big water and mouth of the river, but I'm not sure. thx"

703049,bassboy19,2012-06-05 14:12:00,15,can't say enough good things about blue heron resort...further up river but you can't beat the accommodations and hospitality. guide dennis will put you on the fish and the price is so reasonable you'd be stupid not to take him with you on the first day or so there.
703187,gordy28,2012-06-05 23:50:00,638,"Hey there We are booked to fish at Brennan Harbour on Sept 1 We researched both Vances and Brennan and chose Brennan; Read/received nothing but great feedback about the lodge, hosts and fishing Reasonable upgrades available for boats Was told that by September most fishing (walleye especially) is done in the Whalesback channel Few good threads on both here and there's some links to reviews etc on Brennans site (under check this) Anyway we are going American plan, boat upgrades (17 foot lund explorers w 40 or 50 4 stroke yammys) guide for a day for around $1000 a guy Cheers Gordy"
703212,tomO,2012-06-06 02:01:00,363,"Ok thx guys kinda looking for some thing later this year or next, never been up that way but looks interesting. I assume early spring and fall are the best times."
