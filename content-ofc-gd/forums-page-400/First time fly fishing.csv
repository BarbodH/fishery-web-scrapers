703197,Live2fish85,2012-06-06 00:31:00,1633,Well I got my first fly setup today. I have been thinking alot about it lately and decided to get a setup. Bills bait set me up great as they always do.  I have been tying flies lately which has made me want to fly fish. So I got home and watched some videos on youtube about casting and went at it. Took about an hour and I was casting pretty good I thought. Moved down to where some fish were. Tossed a few times and then a big largie hit. It was a shock as I couldnt even see it just felt it. Got it close to shore and he got off which was fine with me. moved away to another spot and got a rock bass.  Nothing great catching a rock bass but was a good feeling for my first time fly fishing.  Sorry as I didn't take a pic as it was a rock bass lol.  Thanks for reading.

Having a lot of fun with the mooneye on the Grand, although it was a tough one tonight. Let me know if you're interested in meeting up and trying your luck with a fellow floss tosser."
703225,Live2fish85,2012-06-06 03:47:00,1633,Yea. I can say I will like this fly fishing for good. Something about it really got to me lol.  I will be up north this weekend going for pike with it. I will also have the other gear just in case lol.
703236,spincast,2012-06-06 09:31:00,3279,very cool Chris - that's on my list for when the Monday to Friday grind no longer takes all my time.  Have fun pikin' this weekend - look forward to some snaps and a report.
703302,torco,2012-06-06 14:41:00,656,"Thats awesome, seems to be a lot of guys trying it out lately. A couple years ago I tried it and just loved it and pretty much thats most of the fishing I do now. Going to try and hook my brother inlaw this weekend, booked a learn to fly fish day with a local guide for his birthday, it will be mostly review for me but nothing wrong with that and hopefully he will catch the bug."
703320,Live2fish85,2012-06-06 15:30:00,1633,It truely is a wicked way to fish. I like tying the flies to lol. Landing them is even better on your own. Not that I have used another flies other then my own.  I was at it again at 6 am today and went 2-2.
703516,Djeep,2012-06-07 10:33:00,199,glad to hear you like it! I really enjoy it as well. I had a pike get airborne yesterday while charging after my fly. its pretty intense. cant wait to see some pike that you nail.
703633,Live2fish85,2012-06-07 17:04:00,1633,"Thanks Djeep. It is a blast, I can't wait for this weekend. Hope to get some nice pike on it.  Any advice on good flies for pike. I have tied a few but not sure what some good ones are."
703658,misfish,2012-06-07 18:59:00,29133,"I too,just got into it. I find it  relaxing,and fun."
703680,Live2fish85,2012-06-07 19:56:00,1633,It is relaxing. I was out yesterday at 5 am and no one was around. As for fun thats forsure.  I think I may have trouble wanting to fish with any other rod now lol.
703706,davey buoy,2012-06-07 20:34:00,5505, That's what I'm afraid of.
703764,spincast,2012-06-07 23:20:00,3279,  Ha! We can modify that opinion with a nice King 250 foot back on a beautiful on lake O I think.    It does look like a great way to unwind though
703767,Live2fish85,2012-06-07 23:28:00,1633, That is true. Who am I kidding to I will fish any way I can lol.  I can't wait to get some pike this weekend on the fly rod up north.
703798,The JAY,2012-06-08 01:51:00,239,"Nice! I'm a little envious...  I have to wait until Septembers trip to Lady Evelyn to try my fly rod for pike. (Only ever caught 2 around here, and they were on nightcrawlers)"
703803,Live2fish85,2012-06-08 02:29:00,1633,Theres lots of Pike in the hamilton area. Caught  6 in two days from shore.
703806,ecmilley,2012-06-08 02:49:00,2163,"that's awesome, you caught a fish and didn't catch the back of head an ear arm ect sounds like your an expert already. i have 2 fly set ups a 7wt and a 5wt that i havn't seen in 15 years and wish i could remember who borrowed them lol"
703807,The JAY,2012-06-08 02:50:00,239,I do all my fishing in the Grand lately... There was a lake around here somewhere......
703812,Live2fish85,2012-06-08 03:00:00,1633, Far from being a expert lol. When I was first learning to cast I was going back to far and not waiting for the line to straighten out.  An one time I hit.my ear then another off the back of my neck. After that I figured it out quickly what I was doing wrong lol.
