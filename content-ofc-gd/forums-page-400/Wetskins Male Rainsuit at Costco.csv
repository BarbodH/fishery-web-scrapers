703056,icefisherman,2012-06-05 15:04:00,952,"For the die-hard fishermen out there who are fishing not always in ideal weather conditions. Just bought a real nice Wetskins rainsuit from Costco yesterday. Originally priced at $69.99 it is not on clearance at $39.97. Waterproof and breathable fabric, several different colors and good size selection for the male sizes. It is two pieces suit with plenty of pockets and various adjustments. Comes with a detachable hood as well. Great quality and unconditional Costco warranty. Ideal for the outdoors, camping, hiking, fishing, boating, etc. The Costco code for those who want to check stock ahead of time is: 205 950 Here is a photo on the female suit (look is the same but codes are different).      When I checked yesterday there was plenty of stock in Mississauga South, Vaughan, Markham, Richmond Hill and Sudbury. The one I bought was black and love how it feels and looks.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
703057,d_paluch,2012-06-05 15:09:00,343,"Funny, I was out fishing yesterday and once on the water I realized I forgot my sweater at home. Then it started to rain and the wind picked up...not nice in shorts 'n t-shirt. Got me thinking I need to invest in a rain suit, this might be it!   Thanks for the post!"
703059,BillM,2012-06-05 15:12:00,17367,"Bought one last year, great rain suit for cheap!"
703088,mistaredone,2012-06-05 17:36:00,913,I Picked one up last season and they are great. The best suit for the price I found. $40 is a no brainer
703089,Fish4Eyes,2012-06-05 17:43:00,1022,I bought a Wetskins winter jacket that is 100% waterproof and later returned it because it didn't breath at all. I was sweating like crazy inside because of lack of ventilation.  Bill/mistaredone: does the rain suit breath or are you soaked in it?  icefisherman: is that the Burlington Costco?  If reviews are good I may even get one for the wife and then try to convince her that we are not crazy for fishing in the rain .
703090,Headhunter,2012-06-05 17:43:00,5703,"I bought one this spring from Costco... haven't actually been in the rain with it yet, but it seems like a good deal. HH"
703094,icefisherman,2012-06-05 17:53:00,952," I was at the Mississauga South Costco. It is the one on Dundas St West, just east of 403. It does say breathable but obviously I haven't tested that personally yet....  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
703097,Fish4Eyes,2012-06-05 17:58:00,1022," The winter jacket I had said that too. I have been eying this for a while but hesitant because of my experience with the winter jacket. Heck even the reg price $70 is good for a 2 piece rain suit, 40$ is just a bonus."
703098,Lip-ripper,2012-06-05 18:06:00,228,"I bought the same suit and have used it quite a bit. Much better than the cheapo traditional rainsuits, and yes it does breathe."
703108,fishindude,2012-06-05 18:57:00,220,"Thanks for the posting, I just picked one up from the Woodbridge Costco.  Selection was limited but I still managed to find my size (M)  Will report back with a review sometime this season"

703145,cityfisher,2012-06-05 20:38:00,959,good buy! i bought one years ago but i think i need a spare..  THANKS!
703149,Fang,2012-06-05 21:17:00,1330,When these first showed up at Costco a few years ago I bought one as a back up - same grey colour too! It's been through all the crap outside jobs and trips over the years and is still 100% waterproof. Fished a week in Manitoba a few years back and it rained every day. Not totally breathable but it's better than my Columbia which I get almost as wet inside as out when it rains.
703210,mistaredone,2012-06-06 01:53:00,913, My suit breaths fine.
703213,GBW,2012-06-06 03:04:00,8460,2x
703214,Mike the Pike,2012-06-06 03:05:00,3421,I paid that 10 years ago these rain suits are a great bang for the buck.  Good Quality at a great price.  MTP
