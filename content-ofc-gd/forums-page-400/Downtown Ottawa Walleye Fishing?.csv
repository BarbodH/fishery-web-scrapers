703124,rhymobot,2012-06-05 19:55:00,174,Hi.  Going to be downtown Ottawa near Frank Clair Stadium. But will probably only have like an hour to fish and it'll be in the evening or night. Any of you Ottawa folks can recommend somewhere real close to fish for walleye or pike if they're around?  Will have to be from shore and we'll have a car but don't wanna drive more than 10 minutes.  I see the river and canal on the map and even Dow's Lake.   Thanks for your help.
703137,Roy,2012-06-05 20:19:00,13728,Not more than a 10 minute drive eh?  Let me check the map here. What kind of a car have you got?
703141,rhymobot,2012-06-05 20:23:00,174,Haha. Compact rental car.

Dows lake mite get you some pike,perch and crappie, and then Billings Bridge is always good for pike and bass, and people have actually caught muskie from there. The bronson bridge will give you some walleye, probably nothing big though. If you had a boat, you could put it in at Shirleys Bay near Kanata on the ottawa river. Great walleye fishing out that way, or at least there used to be."

703257,jigsnreels,2012-06-06 12:01:00,133,"Billings Bridge is pretty good.  I used to live in Ottawa South and spent more than a few afternoons fishing there (instead of going to class, lol).  If you're driving you can leave your car at Billings Bridge Centre (the mall on the south side of the river, there's a Mickey D's there) and just follow the bike paths along the river, you'll find lots of good spots.  Just beware of the swans."
