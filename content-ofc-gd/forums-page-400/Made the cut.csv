703226,mike rousseau,2012-06-06 04:35:00,4661, Yup  500+ hours on probation...  Then another raise...  I don't plan on letting up anytime soon... This job is great... It's very physical so it's a good workout... I've lost like 30 pounds in 2 months...  And there's room to grow within this company... It's HUGE... So I have to keep going like I'm always on probation so I can try to move up the ladder... And get experience that can help me in the future if something should come up...
