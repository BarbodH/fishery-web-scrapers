701445,Billy Bob,2012-05-31 11:32:00,5865, No.....we actually farmed out the repair work once the vehicle was off warranty...they were all leased from our company owned leasing company....and to be honest our guys were hard on vehicles.....but we had MANY repairs that were just plain poor design fault.....door hinges were the worst I have ever seen....and tranny electronics where also a very poor design back then......modules and connections were a CONSTANT problem....brakes always sucked on GM...and they still do......don't know where they get the metal for those rotors but you can count on replacing them every 2-2.5 years.....so you might as well just do the pads while your add it....I could go on and on.....but like I said......some of our drivers were hard on them too.  Bob
701446,Stoty,2012-05-31 11:33:00,2910," Judging by all your posts, I guess I should have known that you seem to know it all.  I will enjoy my beautiful new truck! Thanks for the well wishes!  Enjoy your import!"
701448,Billy Bob,2012-05-31 11:34:00,5865," I don't own a import....but you may......many GM trucks come out of Mexico in part or whole.....my complete truck was built in Indiana, U.S.A."

701453,Fisherman,2012-05-31 11:50:00,7201,"Haha, just pulling  your leg.  I had 2 Chev trucks, never ever again,  I'd push a wheelbarrow before I'd by another GM product... of any description."
701454,jedimaster,2012-05-31 11:50:00,3472,"My tj transmision was built in china. There is no such thing as domestic or import when it comes to cars. Besides the last I checked there NO canadian car manufacturers. There are plants here but the money goes to all those fat cats in japan, korea or the states. Every car I have ever owned in my lifetime has been an import in my eyes. From plymouths, dodge, mitsubishi, chryco, gm, toyota, honda,.... Even a ford... They are all imports to me."
701456,Stoty,2012-05-31 11:54:00,2910," Not at all... no point in arguing which is better. I'd much rather drive a GM vehicle than a Toyota any day. To each their own, I guess."
703076,JoshS,2012-06-05 16:50:00,729,"How are TJ's for towing?  I went ahead and bought the car Friday. Got a good deal on it and needed a ride fast lol and everything looked good and checked out mechanically. Maybe I jumped the gun a little bc after researching the towing capacity, it states 2000lbs... It's the full size wranglers that I previously looked up, not the sport TJs.  I'm towing a 16ft aluminum with a 75hp two stroke. My boat weighs 730lb dry and motor 280lb. Should I be concerned? I towed a little this weekend and seems fine but want to be on the safe side."
703079,Billy Bob,2012-06-05 16:52:00,5865,Stop worrying and go fishing.....you're well under the limit....unless you're taking more then your limit of fish.....
703080,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-05 16:55:00,10439,It'll be fine.
703099,jedimaster,2012-06-05 18:07:00,3472,Yep you will be fine. The only thing you will want to pay attention to is the drop in your tongue.
703144,Billy Bob,2012-06-05 20:36:00,5865, Yep..........always hated that...... 
703194,Rich Nelson,2012-06-06 00:17:00,332,"   Ive got one too. Cheap, reliable, tons of power, and terrible on fuel...."
703200,Andy,2012-06-06 01:01:00,330," Good luck with the new ride. My son and I just bought a used one yesterday as well. Spent quite a bit of time looking around, saw some that had been beaten up pretty badly. Paid a little more than I wanted to, but engine and interior look mint. I would also be curious how it tows. My lad thinks he would like to tow a boat occasionally as well. Andy"
703215,JoshS,2012-06-06 03:05:00,729,"Thanks guys. It's been a dream of mine for a long time to have the boat+truck combo and freedom to fish whatever waters I choose. I got all excited about my new ride and just assumed it would handle towing, which it sounds like it does just fine. I'm just getting into the truck+boat game.. and MAN DOES IT FEEL GOOD! Got into some nice ski's this weekend bc of that truck! Looking forward to a lot of km's and a lot of fish this season.  Andy - enjoy the new ride as much as I will. It seems to tow ok, not a ton of power (i.e. I put it in 4th going up inclines on the highway) but seems to do the job just fine. Plus it's a fun little truck to drive! Your son will like it."
703220,Skipper D,2012-06-06 03:23:00,1970,Maybe i did'nt read enough but what did you buy Josh .....?????????
703332,JoshS,2012-06-06 15:59:00,729,I got the TJ Skip.. 2003 with 94000km on it.
700940,DanD,2012-05-29 19:41:00,2223, Well I have a French last name (that no one pronounces properly) and I've lived and worked as a mechanic in London for more years then I want to remember; but I never owned a tow truck or lived on or near Exeter road. So I ain’t your man; especially if he owes you money. LOL  Dan.
700945,Billy Bob,2012-05-29 19:50:00,5865, :rofl2:  I had Mopar products.......but that was before I had a job......
700950,big guy,2012-05-29 19:55:00,414," But the thread got off topic. He's not looking for a off road vehicle, he's looking for a tow vehicle, preferably an SUV, to drive around the city mostly and tow a 16 foot boat. A small 6 cyl. pickup, or mid-size SUV would be perfect for what he was describing."
700966,jedimaster,2012-05-29 20:34:00,3472,  Yah I guess if he is comfortable tucking his goods between his legs while he drives he can go buy a Rav4 or a Murano. lol  Be a man get a jeep.  
700987,Fishnwire,2012-05-29 21:22:00,983," You can tow just about whatever you want with a 4.0 litre Wrangler, it's the also the original SUV, and it's great in the city.  I've never spoken with anyone who has ever owned a CJ, YJ, TJ, or XJ that regrets it.  Nor do they regret the subsequent Wranglers they purchase."
701008,Skipper D,2012-05-29 22:30:00,1970,"Its go's the same for fishing as it cause's this in us men ,  testosterone ... i love threads , did i say that right ???????? o well you's know what i mean .. lol ."
701267,JoshS,2012-05-30 18:47:00,729,"Glad to see you guys are having a good time on this thread  Think this is the one: http://www.autotrader.ca/a/Jeep/Wrangler/ORILLIA/Ontario/19_5437645_/  What do you guys think?  I'm kind of sold on the Wranglers look and always wanted one. I've spent many hours online researching and going back and forth with sellers. Hopefully it checks out. Price seems right. Wish me luck.  Thanks again for the help, always can count on some good advice here..."
701268,Raf,2012-05-30 19:00:00,3495,give 'er.  the 4.0 I6 is bulletproof.  I had the same motor in my old XJ (regular Cherokee) the entire drivetrain ran till nearly 400ks before I sold it -- the body definately showed it's age.
701270,Fishnwire,2012-05-30 19:13:00,983,  The price is pretty good.
701278,jedimaster,2012-05-30 20:02:00,3472,"Price is pretty decent. Some spots to check...  RUST Follow the Roll cage down to the floor beside the drive and passenger seats there should be no rust Check the underside of the wheel wells the top flat piece Check the frame especially in the bends in the rear  Mechanics It shouldn't sway on the highway It shouldn't rebound like crazy going over bumps Check for any abuse on the skid plates If its a stick make sure it shifts smoothly  Ask when the fluids were last changed and with what types(differentials, Transaxle, oil etc...)"
701315,Billy Bob,2012-05-30 21:43:00,5865," So then......your comfortable with a vehicle someone beat the crap out of it, OFF ROAD......not for me.....THINK ABOUT THAT......"
701316,Pikeslayer,2012-05-30 21:54:00,1443,"If your buying from a private seller, YOU NEED TO READ THIS: http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/dandv/vehicle/used.shtml and insist the package is provided. Way too many 'curbsiders' out there. Even if it is from a dealer, I would want the same package.  That's my nickel,  Slayer"
701318,JoshS,2012-05-30 21:55:00,729," I'm not comfortable with anything.. I honestly have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to cars  Apparently it is the wifes car, body is in good shape, never been off roading etc. It has less than 100k on it in 9 years so not driven a lot. I'm going to get it checked out at a shop Friday and still shopping around... But comparable to what I've seen out there, this ones seems to be the best."
701319,JoshS,2012-05-30 21:58:00,729," Thanks Slayer, the seller is arranging for this. Good tip."
701323,Skipper D,2012-05-30 22:11:00,1970,"aW SOME jOSH , dose'nt appear to be off roaded , i'd try to pull the price down to and start a 5 and i think you'll meet in the middle  , hope you get it ."
701385,JoshS,2012-05-31 02:34:00,729," Thanks Skip, will do. I know you're up that way and collect those things so don't go buying it now!   Here's a good question: Do 8 foot musky rods fit in a TJ?"
701392,jedimaster,2012-05-31 03:02:00,3472,"I wood say no not straight, maybe on an angle. My 7 foot bass rods had to be put in on an angle.if you are going to compare a few sit in a liberty. Not as rugged as a wrangler but a much more comfortable vehicle to drive. A wrangler is cooler though."
701395,JoshS,2012-05-31 03:15:00,729,I put my rods on an angle going back from the front passenger side. The car I use now is a honda fit and I can get my rods in but barely. Hoping the Jeep has more room.
701397,Cudz,2012-05-31 03:29:00,2652,"I have owned a few Jeeps with the same 4.0 .  Engine is bulletproof but transfer case tends to be average.  TJs are fun.  Go for it if you have always wanted one. By the way, the 4 liter is an inline 6, not a V6"
701423,Skipper D,2012-05-31 07:49:00,1970,"  Its ok Josh ,its all yours for right now my friend , i am up to my neck in Jeeps at the moment .... lol . Do 8' musky rods fit in a TJ ? , just barley , but i did bring home some new 8' floresent light tubes in mine with the passenger seat folded down all the way forward with the back seat folded over but not fliped up against the back of front seats with the hard top on , probably much easyer to do with the soft top on tho . Keep in mine Josh if you can get this TJ before some one eles beats you to it  that you will have bought the ultimate in out door vehicles , you can do the roof rack thing for your rods or perhapes mount a couple rod holders on the back bumper and have them standing there just like we do with them in the back of our boats . This way guys we will know who it is that we are fallowing down the hi way lol ..... Happy Jeep'en & fish'en Josh  , hope it all can come together for you ."
701424,Stoty,2012-05-31 08:51:00,2910, Maybe you should call the Toyota plant and suggest they also put brakes (that work) in all their vehicles.....in case the gas pedal sticks!!!!!
701435,Billy Bob,2012-05-31 10:59:00,5865, So MISINFORMED aren't you.......that proved to be a hoax on all that Bull...to this day I didn't get the suggested Bull repair on my Tundra......  BTW the Tundra brakes are MUCH superior to any 1/2 ton Detroit built crappola.....the front brakes are HUGE and have FOUR pistons on the callipers not one like the cheapo you might be driving.....  Now back to our regular programming....LOL........
701438,Stoty,2012-05-31 11:07:00,2910,"Yes, you're right... my brand new 2012 Sierra Crew Cab is def a ""cheapo""."
701439,Billy Bob,2012-05-31 11:16:00,5865, NO....it wasn't cheap to purchase......and you will be paying dearly for it forever.......repairs up the wazoo.....what I meant is it's built CHEAPLY.....how do I know.......I had several....as a matter of fact I use to take care of a fleet of GM pickups when I worked on the RR......we ALWAYS had one in the shop for repairs.......  Good Luck with it....maybe you will get lucky.....
701441,Fisherman,2012-05-31 11:24:00,7201," Isn't that a union job?  So more than likely, one always had to be in the shop to keep the union mechanic guys ""busy""...."
700843,BillM,2012-05-29 16:06:00,17367," I guess that's why you've got an off kilter opinion on probably the most bulletproof engine/transmission ever offered.  Now, speaking of non domestic trucks, I'd love if Toyota offered the Tacoma with a diesel (Like they do pretty much everywhere else in the world)..  Diesel Hilux would be killer!"
700850,Skipper D,2012-05-29 16:12:00,1970,"  You will do well to get 380 km per tank in the city with the wrong size tires on the Wrangler , better if it still has the factory size tires that it came with . My old 89 black yj wrangler on the hi way with factory size tires took me from Barrie to Kingston and back for 60 bucks two years ago . What was the gas price then ?????"
700858,Skipper D,2012-05-29 16:21:00,1970,  My 2001 TJ right now with 31's and straight 6 with five speed is giving me 380 to 400 km's on the hi way .
700863,Skipper D,2012-05-29 16:32:00,1970,"Heres one more for thought , I have'nt driven the wifes 2006 Liberty much since i bought it for her last year but i think its the best on fuel out off all the jeeps we own , she's driving 25 ...28 km's a day to and from her work and dose it on 30 bucks a week . We only ever took it on a trip once and it did it from Barrie to London and back on a tank for i beleive 80 bucks , it has the v6 automatic ."
700872,Billy Bob,2012-05-29 16:50:00,5865," OUCH....is that what they are getting now a days for a truck.....that MUST be a LIMITED model......at least I would hope.....mine is a SR5 model and it ""listed"" at $31,800 back in June of '07....after factory rebates, dealer discount and the trading in of my 2002 Ford Escape I only had to pay them $18,000........not bad for a brand new truck that will last me for MANY more years to come....at least 20 years I am expecting.  BTW next week it will be 5 YEARS old and hasn't been back to the dealer yet.....I did put in brakes late last summer but that's it........MUCH  MUCH MUCH better then any Detroit truck I have ever owned......  And BillM....how's the price of diesel fuel doing....."
700877,BillM,2012-05-29 16:57:00,17367," Cheaper then gas up here, no complaints...  The 900ftlbs of torque is worth it"
700878,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-29 16:58:00,10439, OH Yeah??!!?? Well your Cummins and the Yota won't do nuttin' against this tow rig and it's Caterpillar 3116 diesel!!!  
700879,Billy Bob,2012-05-29 16:59:00,5865,It's on average $.50 per gallon more here in the states.....
700880,Billy Bob,2012-05-29 17:01:00,5865, But it's a GM....it will be in the shop more then  towing....
700881,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-29 17:01:00,10439, I think that Yellowknife is the only place in North America where diesel is cheaper than regular gas.   :dunno:
700882,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-29 17:02:00,10439, I didn't realize that GM made Cat engines...................
700883,BillM,2012-05-29 17:04:00,17367," Diesel has been cheaper here in Ontario then gas for quite some time...  I usually pay around $1.24 for diesel, on my trip last week diesel was anywhere from $1.24 - $1.30..  I saw gas close to $1.50."
700885,Fisherman,2012-05-29 17:08:00,7201,"Ya, just like everything else GM builds, you can see daylight between the top of the rear mudflaps and the wheel wells, really well executed."
700886,Raf,2012-05-29 17:08:00,3495,diesel looks to be about 5-6 cents cheaper / liter than regular 'round here.
700887,Billy Bob,2012-05-29 17:08:00,5865," Before the gas spike in 2008 Toyota was seriously considering building a 2500 serious diesel truck.....but after gas went well above $4 in '08 I believe Toyota has scrapped that idea completely....they even revamped their brand new billion dollar truck plant in San Antonio, TX where most of the Tundra's were built.......now all Tundra's to the best of my knowledge are coming out of Indiana.....the Texas plant is now building SUV's."
700889,Billy Bob,2012-05-29 17:11:00,5865,Lunch time over....back to work....grrrrrr....play nice boys....trucks are trucks.....
700891,Skipper D,2012-05-29 17:16:00,1970," You know they got their idea from me ....... lol , i built mine back in 1993 but this Top kick sure looks good , i all ways said ..... they are the real full size pickup .... lol , and Boys you wont beleive how many fish you can carry in one of thease ....."
700893,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-29 17:19:00,10439,One of these would probably make a decent tow vehicle too.  
700897,Fish4Eyes,2012-05-29 17:24:00,1022,"Diesel is 2cents more than gas in Hamilton, pretty consistently. 2cents a litres is not going to make or break somebody. To my knowledge and experiences diesel engines don't require cats to be replaced once the motor is not running right like a gas engine would. I've seen a bad running gas engine (one cylinder misfiring) blow out a brand new cat in 2 months of light driving.  My TDI jetta still has the original exhaust on it (after 351km)and has only required replacement of exhaust flanges and clips that hold it in place. Diesel pollutes less as well."

700689,Carp,2012-05-29 03:32:00,1488,"I had a 2007 Ford Escape 4x4, 6 cyl. for four years. (lease) Rated for 3500 lbs. towing capacity. It towed our 16 foot Legend with no problem. Even towed my 5 1/2 x 10 hd utility trailer with 8 x 8 heavy ice hut strapped to it. No issues.  Recently bought a 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4x4 with 3.0 litre, 6 cyl. Mercedes diesel engine. 7400 lbs. towing capacity. 2007 & 2008 are the only years they put this engine in the Grand Cherokees. Towed my friends' 16 ft. Sylvan with 60 hp Merc. a couple of weeks ago. Sometimes I forgot the boat was even back there. This vehicle is great, but unfortunately, the resale price on these trucks is very high.  2005 and 2006 the Jeep Liberty came with a 2.8 litre 4 cyl. diesel and are much more affordable. Might be something to consider."

Haven't done any research on the newer models, but I would expect that they are good too, given that it is a Toyota. Have herd of guys getting 600-700k out of them. Mine is at 315k and showing no signs of slowing down. For your budget, you can get into a 99-02. I find it very convenient that the back window on the hatch goes all the way down. Allows you to communicate with your partner at the launch easier and allows you to transport long materials if the need ever arose. Rated to tow 5000lbs as well. Best part of all I get about 13L/100km when towing approx 3000+ lbs up Hwy 69 which has alot of hills. It is also built on a truck frame."
700720,BillM,2012-05-29 12:00:00,17367, Contractors and the people that use their truck to make a living will disagree with you.  It doesn't get much more reliable then the 350/4L80E combo GMC has been stuffing in their trucks for the past 20 years.  BB that poor Toyota of your would puke it's guts out if it tried to tow what my oldmans Duramax does  :)
700723,DanD,2012-05-29 12:05:00,2223,"JoshS All the different vehicles suggested here will likely do the job you want it to do. Just do yourself a favor once you find something that interests you; go to an independent garage away from the seller and have the vehicle checked out. It doesn’t matter that the vehicle is safety checked and emission tested (if required in your area) neither one is a guarantee that the vehicle is in good condition. All a safety certificate means is that on the DAY of inspection the vehicle has met all MINIMUM safety requirements, set out by the MTO. Plus by having this inspection done before you sit and talk money; this garage may find you some bargaining power. Yes the brakes pass a safety inspection; but there’s only 4mm of friction material left. That means 2 or 3 months before a brake job. Same goes for other mechanical things away from the safety inspection. There could be oil leaks from one end to the other and unless they are “severe” oil leaks they pass safety inspection. It may cost you $75 or $100.00 for this check but money well worth spending. I actually do these checks for my regular customers free of charge. If they buy a decent vehicle I have a decent vehicle to work on and everyone is happy.  Dan."

700760,BillM,2012-05-29 13:22:00,17367,Let's hope Chucks doesn't have headgasket or frame rot issues!  LOL
700762,Skipper D,2012-05-29 13:25:00,1970,"I like to have a bit of fun some times but to be honest last year when i needed a new truck i did try out a new tundra , i liked the horse power it had but since i 've been towing since the mid seventy's and had many turcks i knew after trying the suspention in the tundra would never stand up for me , for light towing yes but not for heavy towing , to play a trick on the dealer at the time , when i brought the truck back from the test drive i said , i wanted one but i wanted it in a 2500 seires knowing full well they did'nt excist  , had they had of i would be driving one right now . The dealer did how ever ask me if i could wait for a few years as they were working on a 2500 series to come out with a Mitsubishe diesel in it , so in the mean time i've bought this ... truck number five of the same brand as my last four old one's gas jobs and this one a diesel ,  i still dont see the Tundra 2500 on the road yet . All i'd say is , buy some thing that trips your trigger and you'll be happy for a long time no matter what it is ."
700782,big guy,2012-05-29 14:04:00,414," Can you get one of those within his price range, $9,000?"
700792,BillM,2012-05-29 14:18:00,17367, A used previous gen Z71?  Shouldn't be too hard.
700800,jedimaster,2012-05-29 14:33:00,3472,"Chuck Norris drives a tundra because he can pull a boat with his teeth. If you are less of a man and need a vehicle to do it, get a jeep.      Enough said..."
700806,BillM,2012-05-29 14:40:00,17367,"Great photoshop, lol."
700813,big guy,2012-05-29 15:22:00,414, And right in to the shop after the first road trip
700815,JoshS,2012-05-29 15:28:00,729,"Really appreciate all the feedback, some great advice. Still looking hard....  Anyone know how the Wrangler is on fuel in the city?"
700827,Raf,2012-05-29 15:41:00,3495," If I were to guess, you are looking at 16-17 mpg (13-15 l / 100) in the city.  Any way you slice it, a vehicle in this category will not be great on gas, especially in the city and mileage will be fairly close across the different models."
700828,BillM,2012-05-29 15:43:00,17367," You obviously aren't a truck person are you, lol."
700837,big guy,2012-05-29 15:58:00,414," Yes, just not a domestic truck person"
700839,jedimaster,2012-05-29 16:02:00,3472,"A 4 cyl wrangler is not too bad on gas, I had one of those. I also used it to tow a 21 foot blazer bass boat with a 250merc on it. I would say that is NOT a recommended towing arrangement for a boat that size. However it pulled around my 16 foot lund without issue.  An SUV or a wrangler shouldn't be considered if gas is a concern. If you need to tow a decent sized boat your options are fairly limited. Towing, 4x4 and fuel mileage is not something that has been solved yet. a 6 cyl wrangler will get about 15-18mpg in the city if you drive it gingerly and use stock sized tires. I have never had a jeep with less than 31's."
700491,JoshS,2012-05-28 18:32:00,729,"I've been shopping for a tow vehicle that can tow my 16 footer aluminum. My budget is tight.. would like to keep it under 9k.  Tons of info online but wanted to ask here...  Can you guys offer some advice on some makes and models to look at and ones to stay away from? I know it more depends on the cars mechanics but some overall advice on the good/bad out there is what I'm looking for. Mostly looking into used SUV's over trucks b/c parking for me is always tight on my street. Also, I won't be doing a ton of towing, more city driving for work. Thanks a bunch."
700495,mike rousseau,2012-05-28 18:42:00,4661,What kind of 16 aluminium?  That could be a row boat style or a big heavy deep V...  For the most part you don't need a heck of a lot to tow a 16 footer of any kind...  Unless  You use a back country dirt launch... You launch in below 0 weather... Or you use a really steep launch...
700498,Roy,2012-05-28 18:47:00,13728,Get yourself a Jeep Wrangler Josh...4L 6CYL. you'll be fine.
700502,JoshS,2012-05-28 18:53:00,729," I'm rolling in a 16.1 deep V with a 75. Don't know the exact weight. I will be fishing until ice up in it. Would like something equipped for most conditions.  Roy - thanks for the tip. I've been looking closely at Jeeps, more so the Liberty and old Cherokee's (b/c of the price) but I've heard more bad than good on them which has kind of steered me away. I'll look at the Wranglers."
700508,uglyfish,2012-05-28 19:30:00,981,"Look for a jeep grand cherokee, I have one. Really nice vehicle. Tows well, roomy inside, can get a 4.0 V6 or the 4.7 V8. Ur better off getting the V8 as u'll get better gas milage out of it. Its a 4x4 so u won't have problems at any ramps.  U should be able to find one in the 2005 range with fairly low km's for under 9 k easy. Prolly even newer models for under 9k if u look around enough."
700514,BillM,2012-05-28 20:12:00,17367,Rav4 V6..
700545,jedimaster,2012-05-28 20:54:00,3472,"I like my liberty. Lots of grunt, haven't had any issues with it. Way more comfortable to drive on the highway than any wrangler I had, and better on gas than any of my cherokees.  How many seats do you need? And dito as above on the gravel and dirt ramps. 4x4 is a god send when pulling a boat out of the water on a rainy muddy ramp."
700556,bare foot wader,2012-05-28 21:21:00,1354,"I tow a 17' lund, 90 horse, with a 4.0L ranger...acceleration and braking are very minorly affected, never felt under powered, not winning any mountain races but climbs with no worries...great for rough ramps/beach launching, rough backroads, etc...i have a 2000 and 09, both 4L 4x, never had a major repair on either, just regular maintenance, easy to work on, beat the snot out of my first ranger and it sucked it all up....respectable mileage(not great, 18ish mpg)and easy with city driving and parking....should be able to find 05-07 for your price  cherokees are good vehicles to tow but hogs on the wallet otherwise, friend tows with a liberty and he echo's jedi's reply"
700559,Raf,2012-05-28 21:29:00,3495,"I also have a Grand Cherokee 4.7 v8 (2001). With your budget you could get much newer.  Very happy with it.  The poster above is right -- in the Grand Cherokee at least, mileage is better on the hwy (21-22 mpg) and/or towing with the v8 than the 6 cyl.  It is worse in the city that the 6.  Do your research.  I'd also look at the Ford Explorer.  More room inside than my Jeep."
700560,JoshS,2012-05-28 21:37:00,729,"Thanks for all the replies. So much out there... the guidance is helpful.  I'm looking for info on what brands offer the best value when buying used and can be said to be dependable more so than others. I've checked out a few pathfinders, 4 runnners, liberties, cherokees, a Suzuki, I've been told to stay away from explorers... lots of options out there! Need this truck to last me a few years of fishing until I can afford to upgrade.  I've heard so many mixed opinions on the liberty, heard it is known to be troublesome before '06? Also have been told rav4's are not ideal for towing because of the small frame they are built on.  I don't mind the rangers but a pickup would be tough to park every night for me on my street and would need 4 seats.  I would be towing in all conditions and definitely want 4x4 for sure."
700562,Twocoda,2012-05-28 21:48:00,4130,go diesel... maintenance is a bit more but in the long run...youll be happy....even with the sometimes higher fuel costs than gas
700565,Dan668,2012-05-28 21:59:00,1120,I tow with a ford exploder. No problems yet knock on wood. But from what I read I wouldn't recommend it lol. We tow also with a dodge ram hemi. Works great. A good choice would be a cherokee
700572,Pigeontroller,2012-05-28 22:17:00,2793,"I have a 2005 Nissan Xterra, 215,000 kms. Spent almost nothing on it, still drives like new...Tows my 16' Lund w/ 90 Fourstroke easily. I will be buying another one someday."
700582,Billy Bob,2012-05-28 22:33:00,5865,"Before my Toyota Tundra I towed this boat with a 2002 Ford Escape without any problems whatsoever......    The Ford Escape comes with over 200hp with plenty of torque.....and if you get one that has the tow package as mine did, it comes with a tranny cooler AND a engine oil cooler.....I also towed this trailer out west......through Ontario....including 17 states and over the continental divide twice (over 10,500 feet) while putting on 6,500 miles in 30 days....AGAIN without any problems whatsoever....  BTW this trailer weighed in at 3,000 lbs loaded....but it did have it's own electric brakes...."
700606,Skipper D,2012-05-28 23:37:00,1970,"Roy's right Josh , this is what i use to tow my 20' cuddy crusier 115 hp . You should be able to pickup a good one for what you want to spend ."
700607,jedimaster,2012-05-28 23:43:00,3472,"Put it this way, pretty much ANY V6 with real 4x4, not awd or locking 4wd, or anything like that will more than likely pull anything within reason that you would want in relation to the size of boat you are looking for. A true 4x4 will typically have big brakes and a strong frame without even having to wonder if its built on a car chasis or something like that. Now for the bad news, a vehicle with 4x4 will be bad on gas. Your gonna have to accept that. Many pickups get as good mileage as any SUV so you aren't gonna save much in gas by going SUV. As far as reliability goes, brand X or Model Y is as reliable as the people driving it, I now people with corollas that blew head gaskets at 100k, I had a corolla that rotted away with 700,000km's on it. Drive it like a used car (EG don't flog the hell out of it), fix what needs to be fixed and keep the fluids topped up and clean and more than likely ANY 4x4 vehicle will do you just fine. I have heard  of Xterra's have major issues with the superchargers, I have heard of Lib's having issues, Durango's, explorers, yota's honda's, fords etc.... 10k is a good chunk of change as far as a used SUV goes. my '05 liberty with 104,000 km's cost me 5000 dollars.  If I was going to rec a truck I would look at the .05 and up Dakota  short box quad cabs.  not too huge, looks current, and reasonably reliable enough."
700609,Skipper D,2012-05-28 23:45:00,1970,"P.S , they also double up as the boat on some days when you need to get back in there to find the good fishing holes .....lol , I have one for each special job i need then for and would never be with out my jeeps since buying my first one back in 2004 . The only time i find them hard on gas is when i use the four wheel drive other then that they are great , keep in mind that they do have a small fuel tank ."
700614,jedimaster,2012-05-28 23:49:00,3472,I pulled a number of TJ's out of the mud with this...   Mind you this was more fun to drive around in during the summer... 
700616,trevy727,2012-05-28 23:49:00,351,"I tow an 18' Lund with a 2 door 2004 GMC Jimmy. I bought it for $4400 and that included taxes, registration fees, certification and e test. It only had 130,000klms when I purchased. It's 4 wheel drive, got a short wheel base and a 4.3l v6 and it's rated to tow 5500lbs. I like it."
700620,Skipper D,2012-05-28 23:57:00,1970,  But jeep cherokee owners don't wave at one another on the road like the TJ guys do ........
700621,jedimaster,2012-05-28 23:58:00,3472,True but we do out of consideration wave at the TJ owners when they run out of fuel on the trails. lol
700622,Skipper D,2012-05-29 00:01:00,1970,"Trust us Josh , jeep guys are like blonds , we do have more fun when we're out , any ways i am getting off this thread before the jeep wars start .... lol"
700623,Skipper D,2012-05-29 00:03:00,1970,Happy -O llll O-'em Jedimaster ................
700625,jedimaster,2012-05-29 00:04:00,3472,"yah me too. Its really hard to drive something else once you get jeep in your blood. I have had 2 TJ's a cherokee and now the liberty. in between I had a silverado, Stealth and a corolla but I always end up in a jeep. If I had the money I would be in a 4 door Wrangler right now. I think that will be my next vehicle. I need 5 seats."
700638,big guy,2012-05-29 00:49:00,414,"If you can swing it, stay away from anything domestic, you will eventually pay more in the long run for repairs. Nissan Frontier is probably the best truck in the industry, no matter the size and Toyota make a fine vehicle as well, although generally more pricey.  I picked up a 2000 Nissan Xterra with low mileage for $4700 last year. The body is mint and it tows really well, just love it."
