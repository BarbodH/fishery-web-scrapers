703450,Pigeontroller,2012-06-06 23:18:00,2793,Sky looks ominous down here in Niagara...
703452,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-06 23:24:00,535,Had to leave the lake early due to lightning. Sucks that I've taken the week off work to fish and it looks like there's going to be 3 straight days of thunderstorms. Hopefully tomorrow it will hold off long enough for me to catch a musky.
703454,lew,2012-06-06 23:31:00,12766, Muskies become VERY active and aggressive just before the storm hits and it's one of the best times to fish for them.  Just depends how close you like to be to the lightning.
703455,Toad Hunter,2012-06-06 23:33:00,261,"lots of thunder and dark clouds with inevitable winds, and flash rain but seems to have blown over(ish) for now in Kitchener. - can anyone in the Haliburton and surrounding area keep me posted- I have a new (ish ) trailer up there and have yet to fill out the insurance papers"

703458,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-06 23:40:00,535," Yeah I was thinking about trying to wait out the storm on shore. Bad conditions today though before the lightning started: hot, sunny with no wind at all."
703471,Joey,2012-06-07 00:48:00,9122,"Was on the 10th floor of mom's condo for dinner tonight when this blew in.  Lots of lightening and thunder, and it poured huge drops when it got to us.     "
