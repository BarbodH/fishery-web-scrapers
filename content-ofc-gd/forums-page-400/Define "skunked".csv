702781,jimmer,2012-06-04 17:21:00,2730,That's what I thought until last Friday morning! And I wasn't skunked. What a crappy day!
702802,jbailey,2012-06-04 18:28:00,866,hmm skunked = bad beer when you get off the water haha
702852,Handlebarz,2012-06-04 21:46:00,3790, I resemble that theroy lol

702916,hoby5,2012-06-05 01:22:00,42,"imo no fish to the boat at all is ""skunked"""
702922,johnl,2012-06-05 01:33:00,197,skunked means you caught nothing at all or a goby or carp

703075,OhioFisherman,2012-06-05 16:36:00,6623,"Skunked, not catching the intended target fish for me. They never seemed to want to weigh in anything but bass at a bass tournament."

I was using corn on my hair rig and although it was not my targeted species I didn't considerate myself ""skunked""...  Tall tale ???...Ask Crappieperchhunter, he helped land it..."
703442,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-06 22:47:00,535,"Well I was skunked today for the first time since April, only saw 1 pike that nipped at my bucktail. I blame the lightning for shortening my day by 4-5 hours.  Monday I had my best pike day by far (in terms of numbers) catching 7 pike (had one on that was close to 40"" but shook the hooks when I turned to grab the net), about 8 more hits and 2 musky follows (mid 30's and 40""er)."

702586,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-04 02:39:00,535,"I've always kind of wondered, does anybody consider it being skunked if you're targetting 1 species, but catch another instead? Say you're fishing wlleye but catch bass, or musky but instead catch only pike, is that being ""skunked""?"
702588,206,2012-06-04 02:43:00,563,Skunked to myself is no fish at all....even if its not the targeted species it always feels good to get at least something in the boat besides weeds!
702589,Twocoda,2012-06-04 02:46:00,4130,Do you really have to catch fish of any species to be skunked? I get the same satisfaction out of any day fishing whether there is fish involved or not....so i guess i never get skunked

702591,BillM,2012-06-04 02:47:00,17367,Skunked = zero fish to the boat.
702592,Stoty,2012-06-04 02:49:00,2910,"IMO, being skunked is not landing your ""target"" species for the day. Mind you... your target species might change through the day, so maybe it's not landing a fish at all...  LOL..."
702593,mercman,2012-06-04 02:52:00,7054,"Where did the term even come from?  to me, even a dink perch removes the skunk"
702594,Twocoda,2012-06-04 02:57:00,4130, I think i would be more comfortable saying i got skunked as opposed to saying i got dinked...well i wouldnt talk about it anyways and go with the skunk if i had to choose

If you and a buddy are walleye fishing and you get 1 walleye and he gets 37 bass; 1 trophy muskie and a sunfish, he got skunked. 2.

702602,whiskywizard,2012-06-04 03:26:00,305,"To me, skunked means no fish in the boat.  If you're out for walleye and you boat an over-eager rock bass, you won't be eating fish tonight but you weren't skunked."

702654,johnnyb,2012-06-04 12:45:00,3413,"For me, skunked is no fish landed.  Having one on the line helps, but if it doesn't make it to the boat....still skunked"

702674,Harrison,2012-06-04 13:19:00,2202,"Skunked - focusing all your efforts using lures, techniques and fishing high percentage areas(structure) for one specefic species and coming up empty handed.  i.e if your in a bass tournament and catch lots of walleye but have no bass to weigh, your skunked.

702686,jedimaster,2012-06-04 13:49:00,3472,Skunked means... no fish in the boat... The following do NOT count as a fish unless you are actively targetting them.   
702699,ch312,2012-06-04 14:13:00,1590,"""skunked"" is a universal term for zero whether you're speaking of fishing, sports, board games, etc. therefore, any species of fish that you land breaks that skunk.  saying that an accidental bass doesn't count towards breaking that skunk is like saying a field goal doesn't break it, only a touchdown. a fish is a fish and any point is a point.  urban dictionary has a few definitions for ""skunked"", but they're not exactly kid friendly..."
702708,lew,2012-06-04 14:28:00,12766, We DID ??......  How big was my fish ??
702710,mercman,2012-06-04 14:38:00,7054,  TOO FUNNY.  We have to go for a rootbeer someday.
702746,NAW,2012-06-04 16:15:00,4022," Don't laugh.    I've done that many times on Simcoe.  Head out on the ice for Whitefish, but don't get any hits all morning.  Go set up on the perch and 1/2 limit out in an hour.  Head home a happy camper."
702775,mike rousseau,2012-06-04 17:15:00,4661, To me it's target species....  If I'm fishing walleye and catch 10 smallmouth and no walleye... In my eyes that's still a failure for the day... And I got skunked for the species I was targeting...  If your in a tournament for walleye... Catching pike...bass...musky... Doesn't mean anything at the weigh in...  But if your just out trying to catch whatever will hit you line... Who cares what's pulling on the other end...  And I have had days in my boat where we were targeting walleye and smallies helped make the day... Or an accidental musky...  If I'm fishing with my normal 2-3 people that are in my boat the most we curse non target fish... But if I have someone that's more new to fishing... The more fish of any species the better...  I wouldn't worry to much...  Just target a good time and you'll never get skunked...
