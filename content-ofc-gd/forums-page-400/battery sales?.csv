Also any good recommends on a brand. It is for starting  and running the fishfinder ,radio and lights. I have a seperate one for the bowmount. I have not heard of good things from the CT ones Natulius. AC Delco still make marine batteries,I bought one years ago from Cosco that lasted 8 years,but now it seems like they carry only Kirkland.thanks for any advice"
