702136,Stoty,2012-06-02 10:44:00,2910,"Just a heads up for anyone looking to get their hands on a GoPro Hero 2.... Sail in Oshawa got a shipment of 16 of them in. They're pretty hard to find, so I'd recommend grabbing one while you can."
702137,ecmilley,2012-06-02 10:47:00,2163,that's something that Royal Distributing usually carry's for the motocross/sled crowd what sail selling them for
702138,Stoty,2012-06-02 10:53:00,2910,"$349.99  They are AWESOME for making fishing videos! They are extremely versatile and can be used pretty much everywhere with all the different mounting options they have (head, helmet, handle bars, suction cups, poles, etc)"
702141,Roy,2012-06-02 11:01:00,13728,"Speaking of which, what are you guys using for editing software? I'm going to get another cam, they're too handy."
702144,Stoty,2012-06-02 11:04:00,2910,"Depending on the size of the project... I use Sony Vegas, Adobe Premier Pro or Windows Movie Maker."
702145,Terry,2012-06-02 11:10:00,14456,Sony Vegas and Premier Pro you don't need to convert them in Sony Vegas but I like Premier Pro better
702146,Roy,2012-06-02 11:10:00,13728,Windows Movie Maker sounds like it would be in my price range.  I certainly wouldn't need anything very elaborate.
702147,Handlebarz,2012-06-02 11:14:00,3790,I'm with you Roy I would love to get the one Brandon uses but when I priced it out my brain erased the name from my head.  I want to get the motorsport one that comes with handlebar mount but can only find it online.
702148,Roy,2012-06-02 11:22:00,13728,"Just get the standard package Mike. All of the accessories are available at a store near you or at least online. Go to Youtube and slap in ""GoPro mounts"" There's a 3 part video there explaining a few goodies."
702149,Stoty,2012-06-02 11:29:00,2910,Scotty makes a mount that would work on poles/handlebars that is around $10.
702151,Handlebarz,2012-06-02 11:39:00,3790,They have the mounts there it just ticks me that they can not order the package I want but do offer me the mounts there for around $20 each so I can buy the gipro they carry for the same price as Motorsport but then pay $40 on top for the correct mount then have two I don't need.
702152,Handlebarz,2012-06-02 11:40:00,3790,I guess I'm just pissy today with missing musky opener and not just to tge weather
702154,Stoty,2012-06-02 11:45:00,2910,You can always make your own mount for pretty cheap. They come with quite a few mounts that you can use to make your own. Like Roy said... tons of videos on YouTube.
702159,fishindevil,2012-06-02 12:27:00,6254,I got the hero2 for me sled last winter and got the motorsports one it comes with a suction cup too then I bought the bag of accessory mounts !!! It's great you can mount it anywhere I took some amazing sled videos as well I used the windows media player when I take the vids of the camera it works amazing and I'm gonna mount it on my boat ad got the mount to put it on my net or wherever I want !!! I also have the chest mount on a strap so it really can go everywhere !!!! And the suction cup mount will not come off I had it on my sled a few times in -20 and worked great !!! The bag of mounts I think was $29 and gives you even more options !!! Oh ya and get a spare battery too !!!!!!
702179,Stoty,2012-06-02 14:12:00,2910,"Ya, get a spare battery for sure! I'm hoping to convince the ""better half"" into getting another one, LOL  Edit - add - The next accessory I want to get is the LCD screen to review the videos, so you can save space by deleting the clips you dont want and knowing exactly which clip it is, so there is no accidental deletions! lol"
702182,Terry,2012-06-02 14:31:00,14456,I just got the lcd screen I was going to wait and just get the wifi but they keep changing the shipping date
702191,woodenboater,2012-06-02 15:19:00,2277,"That wifi unit sounds very sweet and will probably cost the same. The more I see videos here taken with the camera, the more I want to get one of these vs a waterproof p&s. How do the stills look from the Hero2 and are people happy with the different FOV (I presume it's a software crop) ?"
702195,Stoty,2012-06-02 15:30:00,2910,Stills are great from them too! I have absolutely no complaints at all.
702207,woodenboater,2012-06-02 16:09:00,2277,"Dammit Jamie, that's not what I want t hear  Will hafta see how much the wifi costs I guess"
702237,ohhenrygsr,2012-06-02 19:43:00,947,Just came back from Vegas about a week ago. The stores sell them for $299usd
702248,thatleetboy,2012-06-02 20:53:00,143,"FWIW, I just posted a GoPro Hero2 kit in the classifieds here, and apologize in advance if I am breaking a rule of some kind."
702273,aplumma,2012-06-02 22:26:00,6896,299.00 US for the go pro 2 the expected price of the wi fi pack is 99.00. Don't rush to be the first there is going to be some price gouging till the price settles down.   Art
702364,fishindevil,2012-06-03 08:45:00,6254,I got my hero2 at royal distributing in December for$299 reg price was $349 so it was a great deal and I went and bought all the accessories other than the LCD screen. And it's awesome in everyway I have about 100 snowmobile videos and it works great they also now have a model you can carry in a backpack if you go to their website it shows everything !!! And I had a Helmut mout on me all winter so my unit was in the snow all winter and it's 100 % waterproof !!! If you go to vectordevil on YouTube you can see some of my sled vid clips !!! It's unlimited what you can do with the gopro 2 and the hd is great but for sure get a second battery and the bag of extra mounts and you will be able to mount it everywhere !!!!
702976,Stoty,2012-06-05 10:17:00,2910,Wi-fi BacPac is here!  Check this out!
