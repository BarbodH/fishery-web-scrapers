Can't get over it...tried logging on and off many times...same problem persist?!? Any ideas? Is it my/my computer of the board is buggy today?  Thanks,  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

If that doesn't work, download Google Chrome, install it and you should be golden   No problems so far what so ever  Tjunkie"
703465,mercman,2012-06-07 00:04:00,7054,IE9 doesnt like a lot of websites firefox or chrome should fix the problem.

703477,icefisherman,2012-06-07 01:06:00,952," Thanks for posting as this now seems to be some bug with the site not with my browser.... Hope the mods see this and fix it  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
703479,mercman,2012-06-07 01:31:00,7054," Well then,  now that you mention it, i changed my computers at work yesterday, and i was having the same trouble. Thought it was an IE9 problem, as thats what came with the new windows 7. I installed firefox and the probelm went away. Coincidence"
703501,limeyangler,2012-06-07 03:28:00,5204,I had the same problem and switched from IE to Firefox...problem solved.

703539,aplumma,2012-06-07 11:48:00,6896,IE is not friendly with many sites. This site is best viewed with either Firefox or Chrome on PC's.  Art
703573,highdrifter,2012-06-07 13:48:00,2534, Same thing happens to me on my home pc.  No problems at the work pc though..   It's still a royal pain!!
703577,NAW,2012-06-07 14:05:00,4022,"Same thing happens to me.  I click the little down arrow, and it stays up for about 5 seconds, the vanishes.  Even if you can click the PM icon before the menu disapears, it only takes you to the profile page.  IE9.  Real pain in the  If someone sends me a PM, I read it, and reply.  Chrome is all I use at home, and have never had an issue."
703626,Roy,2012-06-07 16:56:00,13728,"It seems that it's an IE9 issue. For those of you still experiencing problems, do a Ctrl-F5 hard refresh and see if that helps. Jason at Invision Power Services may have solved our problem. He also says that IE9 was released after our board software.  Hope this helps."
703653,highdrifter,2012-06-07 18:48:00,2534, Hard Refresh...  Of course!!  Thanks pal!
703666,icefisherman,2012-06-07 19:26:00,952," Thanks Roy. Did just that...and it worked. I do have Firefox on my other PC but need to keep IE9 on this one, so your solution was welcome. Considering lots of people are using IE9 it's good there is a solution.   Cheers,  Ice Fisherman"
703719,NAW,2012-06-07 21:10:00,4022, Works great!  Thanks Roy
703736,Jer,2012-06-07 21:58:00,1426,"Thanks Roy, I've been having the problem for a while and now it works, as easy as that. Is this a permanent fix or will I have to ""hard refresh""    every once and awhile?"
703749,Roy,2012-06-07 22:20:00,13728," It's a permanent fix Jer. And, while I'd be happy to deserve credit for this fix, I've got to say that it's the fine folks at Invision Power Boards who jumped in to fix it. They've really got a solid group of problem solvers there.  Glad everything is back to normal."
