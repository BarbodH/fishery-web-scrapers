703042,LucG,2012-06-05 13:51:00,779,"Hey Guys, Just looking for a bit of advice in regards to setting a Minn Kota Fortrex & Lowrance HDS 5.  It seems as if it is not connected to the transducer, I am getting no depth or water temp readings, not even getting random numbers just dashes (---).  Under sonar settings, I found where you have to select the right transducer, but there is a very big list and I'm unsure which one corresponds with the built in transducer in the the Minn Kota Fortrex 101.  Any help is apreciated.  Thanks"
703045,scugpg,2012-06-05 14:01:00,1373,Generic 83/200 I think is what you want.
703051,LucG,2012-06-05 14:24:00,779,Thanks! I'll give that a try tonight!
703170,Garnet,2012-06-05 22:39:00,2056,Just put your hand on the transducer you will feel it ping.
703607,LucG,2012-06-07 16:22:00,779,"I tried both Generic 83/200 & Generic 50/200. Still no results. I also went through a few other, all the while keeping my hand on the transducer, but still no ping.  I guess my next step is to remove it from the dash and make sure all the connections are intact.  Any other suggestions if proper connection isnt the issue?  Thanks"
