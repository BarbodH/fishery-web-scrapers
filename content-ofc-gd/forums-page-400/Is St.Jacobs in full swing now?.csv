703083,Christopheraaron,2012-06-05 17:08:00,3525," x2 on that, you'll find out why when you get there!"
703084,misfish,2012-06-05 17:13:00,29133,"   Ah, thats not very helpful. Why dont I want to go on Friday? I dont want to waste my time and gas."
703087,Christopheraaron,2012-06-05 17:33:00,3525,"The market is the main reason to go there, it's open from really early in the morning to 3pm (on saturdays), all of the mennonites set up their stands, they sell everything from cheap toys to finely aged cheese, it's a lot of fun, also if you get tired of that elora is very nice, and you might find me fishing in the gorge."
703100,fishingwithbob,2012-06-05 18:16:00,123,  The St. Jacobs Farmers’ Market is open:  • Thursday and Saturday    7 am - 3:30 pm all year • Tuesdays                          8 am - 3 pm in the summer  From: http://www.stjacobs.com/farmers-market   
701999,misfish,2012-06-01 20:46:00,29133,"Awhile back ,I had asked about this little town. Really looking forward to spending a weekend there.Should we be heading there now,or wait a few weeks? Cant wait to go there.    Thanks  Sorry,forgot the NF."
702011,timmeh,2012-06-01 21:05:00,609,"The market and all the shops are up and running, as long as the weather cooperates any weekend would be fine."
702015,Christopheraaron,2012-06-01 21:15:00,3525,"My whole family pretty much lives there, there's always something to do, be sure to grab some of the cinnamon rolls from the market. Also, the conestogo has great pike fishing in some areas if you can sneak away."
702018,FrankTheRabbit,2012-06-01 21:18:00,479,"Thanks for the tip. Really enjoy going there. So many good produce, food, etc. Their spicy cheeses and salami are top notch. There's also a vendor who sells these really thick wool sweaters. It's the warmest sweater I've ever worn and a whole lot cheaper too.  I look forward to this summer's trek to St Jacobs."
702021,misfish,2012-06-01 21:32:00,29133, Is there mitts as well? Nothing finer then a good pair of thick wool mitts.
702022,Christopheraaron,2012-06-01 21:34:00,3525,"Be careful which one you go to though, it should be right beside a maple syrup vendor who has a map of the world plotting all of their customers."
702023,Toad Hunter,2012-06-01 21:34:00,261,"it's been in ""full swing"" for a while now, I'm pretty sure the indoor parts are year round but could be wrong. (not sure if all the produce is local yet or not due to grow seasons etc. but all still very good). The ol lady and I go all the time for steaks, summer sausage, and to look around but ALWAYS stop for apple fritters (worth the line for sure)  - Frank, is the Sweater vendor that u are talking about the one that sells the Alpaca wool sweaters ? I would have to agree with you if you are. Washed mine numerous times and still the softest thing I have felt - errr as far as clothing goes"
702028,Christopheraaron,2012-06-01 21:43:00,3525,Didn't apple fritters leave? Would love to grab some on my way up to elora on sunday.
702031,Toad Hunter,2012-06-01 21:50:00,261,"when did it leave ? I was there in April (maybe late march) and they were still there, gawd I sure hope not ) not sure why it would leave, had to be the best money maker in the whole lot ! lol - but I'm pretty sure you're out of luck Sunday anyways. (only open thurs and sats) if I remember correctly."
702036,FrankTheRabbit,2012-06-01 21:56:00,479,"Misfish->I don't recall seeing any wool gloves/mittens since I bought it a few years ago. He may have something what you're looking for, but even if he doesn't, I'm sure another vendor will have something.  Toad->Yup, that's the same fella! I love how well the sweater works as a mid-layer during the winter months. It took me a few years to pick out the pieces of straw still embedded in the wool.  The only thing that has worn out is the zipper, which a local seamstress should be able to help me patch up. When I was at SAIL over Xmas, they were selling the hoodie sweater for $149. I think I paid $79 a few years ago.  Mr. Alpaca sells those jackets that zip up to your side...I've always been curious with them and might pick one up on my next visit. Only wish they were a bit closer."

702051,misfish,2012-06-01 22:27:00,29133, Will I break a tooth G?
702052,Christopheraaron,2012-06-01 22:28:00,3525,"I thought they closed last year? Maybe it was just for the season, but I remembered getting them in the middle of winter as well."
702054,Gerritt,2012-06-01 22:34:00,6129,"  LOL hopefully not again! dont leave em in the fridge for 5 months to ""age"" them  G"

702854,misfish,2012-06-04 21:54:00,29133,"Is there a motel just out of town? Man, the local ones would bite my wallet. Cripes,I stayed at the falls cheaper then what they want there.Also need to be pet friendly."
702858,registerfly,2012-06-04 21:57:00,198,"Im heading up that way for Civic long weekend. Four families camping over at Elora so Saturday will hit up the market. Some fly and tubing on the Grand, can't wait."
702867,Christopheraaron,2012-06-04 22:23:00,3525,"The best western down the road from the market is nice, I stayed there, average price, not sure if Gizmo would be welcome, I'll check."
702868,Christopheraaron,2012-06-04 22:25:00,3525,"Never mind, no pets allowed, good luck!"
703062,misfish,2012-06-05 15:23:00,29133,"Well were going to go next friday in the morning.If need be,we,ll find somewhere to stay,but were thinking a day trip for now.   Thanks again for all your help."
