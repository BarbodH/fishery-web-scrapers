The cottage is located on Dark Lake (Wilberforce Area) and I'm told it stocked with lake trout and it is a DEEP lake, approx 100ft I have been to the cottage 2-3 times during the summer, I have fished Elephant lake and casted Dark Lake for some smallies, but I have NEVER targeted the lake trout in the lake and I think this year would be a great year to try it. I have done a little reading on deep water trout fishing with no down riggers. and I don't think its going to be that difficult.  2oz bottom bouncer with about 3-4 ft leader and a spoon coming off the back. Trolling speed  "" Fast enough to make the lure work, and no faster""  We are going the week of July 13th to the 20th..... I have read this isn't great Lake Trout season, would it be ok on a lake this deep ?  What color spoons and what size should I be picking up ? Is there any other pieces I should add to the presentation ? beads, blades, etc.  Any help would be great ! Thanks"

Sounds like you are on the ball...  Might wanna add a gang troll to your box, but that's totally up to you..   I'd stick to smaller NK spoons, husky jerks, J11's, etc..."
702678,Lunker777,2012-06-04 13:30:00,866," I read that summer trout fishing is fairly simple aswell.... they stack up in the cool water spots so they are more concentrated !! Whats a ""gang troll"" ???  Thanks for the reply"
702679,Sinker,2012-06-04 13:31:00,8692,"I've had a cottage there for over 20 yrs. Grace lake is better for trout in my experience. There are also many rainbow lakes in the area, that I find more productive, and amazing table fare!  I don't do a lot of trolling in the summer for lakers, but in the spring we do well on #9-11 Tail dancers. Even in the summer, the trout aren't all that deep. 30ft is usually a good starting point. Leadcore works well too.  The times I have tried them with the riggers, we got them on #60 sized williams wobblers in blue/silver, and gold/chartreuse, down 30 and 40ft.  Stick to the north end of GRace and you will pop a few trout. They are mostly right in the slot size, but still fun to catch. If you need any more specific info, pm me.  S."
702681,johnnyb,2012-06-04 13:38:00,3413,Don't overlook vertical jigging either...put the electronics on that new rig of yours to use
702682,Lunker777,2012-06-04 13:40:00,866, Thanks for the info... I will be sending you a pm !   Hahaha Im way ahead of you... Im so pumped to get to use the electronics this trip ! Should be fun !
702975,singingdog,2012-06-05 10:14:00,1047,"IMHO, trolling for lakers in the summer is an exercise in washing lures. IF you have a good idea where the fish are, then jigging is a much more efficient way to find fish. Even if you are going to boat around to find fish - presumably with electronics - then why putt along at trolling speed through all kinds of unproductive water? Jigging spoons, heavy tailspins, and heavy white tube jigs will all catch them once you find them."
