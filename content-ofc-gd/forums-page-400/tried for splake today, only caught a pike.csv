702558,adolson,2012-06-04 01:25:00,783,"I went fishing for splake this afternoon with no luck. I could see fish in shallow, but I wasn't sure what kind and they weren't eating my lures.. I did have a couple bites right after a heavy rain fall, but they're tricky.  I did a bunch of trolling and all I caught was this pike. It's not gigantic or anything compared to what some of you guys catch (34"") but it's the biggest one I've seen in person. My right arm is wet because I didn't take a net with me (just forgot it in the trunk, but it wouldn't have fit in my trout net anyhow). A nice cottager took the pic for me and we had a good chat for a while. I would have much rather caught a little 14"" splake, but at least I caught something.  I also caught some kind of Matrixx lure that someone lost, so double bonus.  "
702559,Nipfisher,2012-06-04 01:28:00,2449,Always nice to catch a PB pike. Good to get out fishing even when your skunked.
702561,Handlebarz,2012-06-04 01:34:00,3790,Nice going if your having trouble with the splake try using a crank bait deep running like a reef runner chrome/blue worked a lot for us when dad and I would fish them years ago
702563,spincast,2012-06-04 01:42:00,3279,"I dunno, 34 in pike sounds like fun to me. Nice gator."
702567,adolson,2012-06-04 01:49:00,783,"Thanks for the tip on splake tackle, Mike P. I only tried spoons and spinners today, but next time I'll try a crank.   Haha, well yeah, it was fun. It took off and peeled drag 4 or 5 times, dove straight under the Sportspal a couple times. There aren't many weeds in this lake so it didn't wrap around and just sit there like in many of the other pike lakes I've fished, so it put up a good fight. It was pretty exciting and fun, I just really wanted trout."
702573,Slop,2012-06-04 02:07:00,151, Nice Pike!
702579,Rod Caster,2012-06-04 02:34:00,5784,"Nice pike. I should have given you a Team 2 sign last time we met haha. Your not having much luck with the splake, are you?  I got into some good walleye tonight at the north bay waterfront."
702584,mercman,2012-06-04 02:36:00,7054,"Nice going Dana Dont feel bad, i went for Musky, and ended up with Walleye. 8lbs of walleye !!!!"
