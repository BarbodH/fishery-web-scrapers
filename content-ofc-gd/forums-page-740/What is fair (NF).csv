One good move if you're quick enough is to scrape your shoe down their shin----hurts like hell if you've ever done. Follow up with a toe stomp to finish it off.

But in the event this is not possible you are taught to disable your attacker by means of absolute.... In other words, If I have the chance to stop you from attacking me I will not push you away, or put you in a submittion hold and make you cry uncle. Instead I will break your collar bone, nose, reverse an elbow, finger, knee, foot...what ever you give me, I will break it, and do it as fast as I can.  The idea is to disable your attacker so the attack is done. With luck that can be accomplished quickly with one or two strikes. But in the event your attack is severe, your cornered, or the option to run is impeded by say multiple attackers....you better beleive your eyes, throat, and junk are in play.  Self defence is exsactly that...preservation of your own well being and or life. Once you have rendered your attacker as no longer a viable threat you've done what is with in your legal rights. If you cross the line after the individual(s) has been rendered harmless you now have legal issues. Its a fine line to walk but cooler heads will prevail most times."

One thing I would be leery about teaching kids is hitting someone in the throat. Yes, it will probably stop your attacker, but if you break the trachea, you better have a damn good reason for doing it. That is a last resort move if you feel your life may be taken. After that, anything pretty much goes. There is no such thing as a fair fight. If you look @ most self defense classes, they do not teach you how to fight, they teach you how to defend yourself, whether that's leaving the situation or stopping your attacker (verbally or physically). Each situation is different and to be able to tell the difference comes from experience or from training. Most of it comes from your own awareness of your surroundings. Know your surroundings & trust your instincts."
422565,SlowPoke,2010-01-15 12:52:00,2984,"Welcome to the board!   As far as fighting goes; my father trained self defense in the militia. He taught me some submission holds that later paid off working in bars but the most importent advice he offered was ""aim for the back of the head"". You don't have to be big or strong, wait for your opportunity and follow through. I've been on the receiving end of nard shots, eye-gouging and hair pulling; when you're in survival mode that is just antagonizing, not debilitating. I wouldn't go as far to say it's a sissy move but I would advise it. Conserve your energy and make your stike count."

422589,cram,2010-01-15 15:24:00,1733,"  If you want to risk killing someone or seriously injuring their brain, then yes -- aim for the back of the head where the brain stem is most exposed.    :blink:  Sounds to me like the OPs 16 yr old son is getting picked on by bullies.  Eye gouging, ball kicking, and hitting in the back of the head probably makes sense if he fears for his life.  If its just getting picked on by a bully at school, i'd say best to do is make fun of the bully (in a way that he's embarassed to pick on you) and/or just stand up for yourself.  Punch him in the nose.  Most bullies like to pick on people who won't push back.  Kicking people in the balls and gouging eyes is a one way trip to being made fun of even more."
421902,BITEME,2010-01-13 16:40:00,1968,"Good Morning Everyone  This is not fishing related but I’m defiantly fishing for some kind of input. The subject today is fighting. I’m not sure about the ladies but most of the guys must of had one or two. Anyway got into a conversation with number 3 about the subject of defending ones self against an attacker. Now I for one believe there is no need to pick a fight, but there are times when you need to defend yourself and as far as that goes my belief is you do what is necessary to keep from getting a beating with the amount of force you apply equal to the attack. So I said if all else fails you go for Throat Eyes or Nards to diffuse the situation booting someone in the head is not cool and beating someone unconscious is not necessary unless said individuals intent is to cause grievous harm. Whatever you do is to subdue the individual to give you ability to get away and never turn your back. Well I was informed that you could do none of these because you would lose face because it is for lack of better words SISSY. I’m told it is better to take the beating then to defend any way possible. What is wrong with this picture this type of situation is not a sanctioned event and pretty much rule less. Can I get some opinions on this am I completely wrong in my advice just throwing this out there?  Confused Peter"

421920,jayess,2010-01-13 17:13:00,187,"Also one for talking it out, but it's a very subjective thing. Some people seem to get more offended by words than violence, and I think news broadcasts today can attest to some of that especially when the ""R-word"" is involved. That seems out of context here though...  Fighting ""dirty"" doesn't always work. It's a romantic notion that someone will drop to the ground with a kick to the nards -- which undoubtedly is the case many times -- but I'd still be prepared for much more than a quick getaway. Given that the context seemed to warrant violence one at least on party, likelihood tells me you'll have a pissed off guy with sore nards after you.  Some classes in self defence training, formal or not, may be ideal for someone who is not comfortable with physical defence."
421921,Syn,2010-01-13 17:14:00,519,"""my belief is you do what is necessary to keep from getting a beating with the amount of force you apply equal to the attack.""  I think the above quote is wrong with respect to the law. If you believe that you or someone else are in imminent danger of great bodily harm or death then it is ok to use force exceeding what the person is dishing out as defense to immediately stop the action eg shooting someone with a knife or bat who is about to strike you. Of course you will have to explain your reasoning of your use of force model in court but I'd rather be alive and take a chance of going to jail than dead. Situational awareness is the best to use and sometimes running away does not help you if the person chasing you is faster and/or you are not a good runner.   Something interesting for security guards in Ontario: If you are being attacked by someone with a knife (and can't disengage safely) and are able to disarm the suspect you then can not (legally) pick up that knife to defend yourself because a knife is not a defensive weapon. Good thing is that some flashlights have slightly curved and sharpened fronts to defend yourself which is just as lethal as a knife. Courts can't say you can't use it because if they ask, you just say its a flashlight."
