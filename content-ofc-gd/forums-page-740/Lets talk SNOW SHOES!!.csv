421565,anders,2010-01-12 17:33:00,1168,I love the bindings on my alum shoes...that being said...is it possible to incorporate the new style binding with the cleats and such to the wooden style?  The cleats are a huge advantage in my books for what i like to do
421576,Sinker,2010-01-12 18:26:00,8692,"I like my wooden shoes. I just can't seem to find the right time to wear the aluminum ones..........unless its icy, but then I don't need shoes. I will sometimes wear a pair of those cheap, strap on cleats you get at CT, when I put on my wooden rackets. Its not the best rig, but it sure helps up and down the hills.  What kind of bindings are you guys using on your wooden shoes? I have a new set to put on mine......can't remember the name of them. I""ll post a pic once I""m home. The traditional leather ones are OK if your just going for a short hike, but if your going into speck country, I want something that's not going to break on me.  s."

My wife and I bought each other a pair of snowshoes from Costco this year because this is something I have been wanting to try for a couple of years now. they are ""Snow Mountain"" brand by Faber, which is a Canadian company from Quebec. They are made in Canada by a company with 135 years of experience!  The shoes seem to be decent enough quality for beginners and are warranted for 3 years.  They are aluminum frame with adjustable ratchet bindings. They have Crampons for traction and are rated for ""On Trail"" and also ""Off Trail"".  I had a chance to try mine out last week-end for a bit and it was a lot of fun. Although we have about a foot of snow on the ground, it is kind of crusty. We need some fresh powder to give them a true test.  Oh, and the best part..........they were $130.00 per pair. Not bad to try something out!  Just thought I would throw this out there for anyone interested. An interesting thread all the same!"
421708,archie_james_c,2010-01-13 00:48:00,618,Excellent posts guys! I just got back from Gamitagama. I'll reply to each of your replys tomorrow and post a report of Gamit

421727,Sinker,2010-01-13 01:36:00,8692,"We use the Faber's at work for the  kids to use. They don't get used on any hardcore trails or anything, but they hold up pretty well for what the kids put them thru. We haven't had any break yet, in 3 years, so we just ordered another 25 sets.  The bindings I put on my wooden shoes are also made by Faber. So far so good on them, but I've only used them a couple times so far.  S."
421808,singingdog,2010-01-13 11:33:00,1047,"I sell snowshoes, as well as use them almost every day. We carry Atlas, Tubbs, GV.  Deciding between the different companies is really about deciding which bindings you like better. I prefer the high-end Atlas bindings (11 or 12 series): they have great foot hold, don't break, and are super-easy to use. Some folks prefer the ratchet-style bindings that GV is using. I don't much like the ratchets, but that is purely a personal preference. We have some guys that beat the heck out of shoes (hydro workers, tree markers, trappers) and they all seem to prefer the GVs  Durability: I haven't noticed, over the past 10 years or so, one company being more or less durable. There is always the occasional glitch (bad run of ratchets or pop-rivets), but no ""trends"" that say to me that one company makes a more durable shoe than the other.  Warranty is as much about the shop as it is about the company. If the shop is willing to go to bat for you, then they will get them warrantied most of the time."
421892,archie_james_c,2010-01-13 16:13:00,618," I did as soon as they showed me that video   I understand the debate of wooden/float vs. aluminums, but as Dr. Sal said, skiing down 30 foot hills on wooden rigs isn't fun   That price on your website for shoes, is that with taxes and shipped?   This is a very good idea RattleTrap, while I don't have a Costo near me there are lots of stores that sell beginner brands, I'll have to take a close look at them.   This right here, is great. I love hearing from businesses that sell more than one brand...keeps the bias out of it"
422205,Dabluz,2010-01-14 06:28:00,701,"What are the best snowshoes for really deep soft snow.  I mean snow so soft that when you step off your snowmobile, you sink almost to your waist.  We get quite a bit of snow where I live but less than the regions closer to the St-Lawrence.  However, it never gets warm enough for the snow to get hard.  Without snowshoes, it's trundging along in snow up to your crotch all winter.  I've always liked my traditional snowshoes because the snow does not accumulate on them but the hole where the toe of the boot must pass through is too small.  I have to wear huge snowmobile size 12 boots to stay warm."

422232,singingdog,2010-01-14 13:01:00,1047," Although I really like the modern shoes, it is tough to beat traditional wood/rawhide shoes for those conditions. You need a lot of float for deep, fluffy snow. An aluminum decked shoe that is going to be big enough is also going to hold a lot of snow, which can really wear on your knees if you are going any distance. The boot-size thing is just a matter of the lacing design. You may find a local repair/snowshoe maker that can alter the lacing on a pair for you."
422336,Dabluz,2010-01-14 20:26:00,701,I've got a really old pair of snowshoes....they look hand made.  Very light and the webbing is close and fine....like the homemade ones that the natives make.  But....they are quite old and probably fragile.  They have a large hole for the toe of my huge snow boots.
422337,jayess,2010-01-14 20:33:00,187,"FYI: Snowshoes from Atlas and GV are on clearance at MEC (Mountain Equipment Co-op) right now. For the northerners or others unable to visit the store, they do ship and I believe if you spend over something like $150 the shipping is free."

422448,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-15 01:24:00,0,"those new msr's are worth looking at because you can buy spare binding components for in the field repairs.   given the amount of snowshoe binding failures i've seen in the past 4 or 5 years in the park, this is a really good concept."

421387,troutologist,2010-01-12 00:51:00,951,"For that rough hiking , breaking trail too the new ones have crampons, which make life so much easier that the older wood ones. Also there is very little pivot side-to-side for you foot, makes turning quickly and tight manuvering much easier in my opinion.  Im a big lad as well and have to problems with the new style."
421388,Dara,2010-01-12 00:53:00,3052,I have a pair of wooden ones...they were carried mostly for emergencies....I did use em a bit though.  My wife has a pair of GV's and loves them.

I also have a pair of old wood & leather ones, they're good too, especially in really deep powdery snow, but if you are going up any sort of incline, they're less than ideal, no traction.  I would say in the park, you would want snowshoes made for off trail use with built in crampons. GV makes good snowshoes, you'll be happy with them."

The ones I've been looking at the MSR Denali..  All the reviews look good except for the guys that use them for hardcore hiking, and they seem to wear out a little.  They have a modular attachment system to add floatation to the shoe..  I'm not sure about the warranty on them..  Anyone have any experience with these??"
421522,TJQ,2010-01-12 15:00:00,7806,"Its very dependent on your preferences, Monique and Avery love the GVs,aluminums, but Jaden and I prefer the wooden ones.  My main complaint with the aluminum ones is that snow builds up on them and increases the wieght, however bindings are much better. Also, personally I believe floatation is better with wodden ones.  If I was walking a long way in unpacked snow, i would be wearing wooden ones.    If I was gonna buy a pair of GVs aluminums, they would be the Wide Trails, a great pair of shoes with a lifetime warranty.  Aluminun ones arre also noisy as far as im concerned."
421538,Dara,2010-01-12 16:47:00,3052,Interesting...thankyou TJ.  I have wooden and am wondering if there is any boot attachment you can get to add on the toe for traction on hills
