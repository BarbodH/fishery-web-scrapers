Stanley Park = Paradise right there . took a pic of a tree growing over a tree Stump .        Day two ...  Drove up to Squamish to see the salmon run , hopped in a raft and slowly drifted Squamish River , missed it by a month or two...                 So if your wondering if theres salmon in the mountains of BC the answer is yes ..    Came across this table used for cleaning way back in the Days  1930 ish    Made of BC fir I guess..     A real Bald Eagle paradise along the river...                 2nd year Juvenile     Day three ...  Whistler Mountians       The rain started to fall and the wind picked up , heres a Blue Heron having a Bad Hair Day .      The next couple of days were back to R&R..."
