I'm pretty sure whoever was asking before has already made the trip but in case anyone is coming later let me know. I'll keep the info just in case. It's $375 for 4 hours (two people) or $475 for a full day. An extra fisherman is $50 but keep in mind there's only so much room on these 18' skiffs. There's no wading due to the muddy bottom in the area which is about 45 minutes north of Cancun.  JF"
