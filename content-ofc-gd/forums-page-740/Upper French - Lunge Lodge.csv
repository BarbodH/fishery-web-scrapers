My buddy and I are headed to the Upper French this spring (June) to fish for pike and muskie.  We're staying at Lunge Lodge this time.  We've been up nthere twice before, but this will be our first time at Lunge Lodge.  Has anyone ever stayed there?  We've had some great success in the past years in this area, but I'm always looking for more tips.  I'm interested to see if anyone else has fished this part of the river and is willing to share tips.  I don't proclaim to be an expert, but as I said, we've had our share of success catching big pike and muskie.  Look forward to hearing from you all.  -Gino"
