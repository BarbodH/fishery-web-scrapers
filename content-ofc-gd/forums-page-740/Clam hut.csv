422670,GBW,2010-01-15 19:20:00,8460,Hey all.  I was wondering if there is a way I can make my clam 2000 hut a little bit stronger in the wind department.  I ask as it's getting some wear marks and the wind is coming through (lightly) in spots.  Is there something I can use to coat it and not do more damage to either the inside or outside?  Thanks.  Geoff
