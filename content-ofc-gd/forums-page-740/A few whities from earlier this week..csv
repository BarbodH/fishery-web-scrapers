422391,BillM,2010-01-14 23:21:00,17367,"Dave and I hit the known spots for whities and made out pretty good.  First spot was a bit slow, but I nailed one right off the bat..  After the move it was on..   I can't count the number of fish we missed, but it was quite a few...      I landed a real nice 6-7lb'r but we had our limit so it was going to be released.  I tried to stick the head in the hole while Dave grabbed the camera, but she shot out of my hands!  Nice shoulders on her..."
422394,anders,2010-01-14 23:26:00,1168,Nice fish man!

422418,johnnyb,2010-01-15 00:27:00,3413,"Nicely done, guys!  I like the little red collar for the treble hook on the williams"
422420,FUSION,2010-01-15 00:31:00,81,Nice work boys! I am hitting the ice myself in the am.
422421,Kinger,2010-01-15 00:32:00,351,Nice fish.  My mouth is watering thinking about fresh whities in my cast iron.
422422,douG,2010-01-15 00:37:00,2693,"Good shootin', BillM.  If you want to chat about May, send me a pm."
422429,wallacio,2010-01-15 00:54:00,475, Good eye.   That is actually one of the small tags that come with Swedish Pimples which I put onto the split ring.   That smaller spoon in the 1/2 & 1/2 hammered finish is definitely my go-to lure for Simcoe.   Good luck tomorrow Andrew!
422431,Skud,2010-01-15 00:59:00,739,"Good work Gents. I may head out to that area on Sunday morning.  BTW, how deep were you fishing?"

422445,BillM,2010-01-15 01:21:00,17367,"  Andrew, where you think of hitting tomorrow?  I'll be out solo tomorrow am as well.   Drop me a PM or give me shout..  I think you have my phone #...   -Bill"
