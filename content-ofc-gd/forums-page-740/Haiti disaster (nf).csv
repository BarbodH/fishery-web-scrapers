My sympathy and condolences go out to all the survivors.   Granted it is not on the same scale nor do I know all the facts (little help here) but I find it rather odd that when a community here in Ontario is severely damaged by a tornado (Vaughn), they have to apply to our government for aid/assistance only to be turned down.  Any armchair polticians here care to shed a little light on the subject???"
