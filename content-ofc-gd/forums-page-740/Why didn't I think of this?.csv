Now, I'm not much of an ice fisherman, i'd rather troll in my boat but what the heck, you gotta feed your obsession sometime. Especially since my wife got me an ice fishing rod for christmas.  So I got all my chores done around the house and headed down to gather my new rod and tackle to give it a try. I was in town this morning and didn't get any minnows because, I HAD MINNOWS, those frozen shiners we can buy in the grocery store.  Who need to spend more when you already got .  I go to the freezer and yup, my minnows are all frozen, TOGETHER , in  a large clump, totally useless for today. So I went and tried my luck with GULP.  After an hour, i hadn't had a bite, I packed up and headed up to the house for a power nap.  So tomorrow, my minnows will be thawed and maybe, just maybe, I'll have a better time and get something to bite, the GULP sure didn't want to work today."
