422301,Spiel,2010-01-14 18:05:00,9065,LOL....I think the guy with the shovel gotsa schnoot full of woodka.
422313,Dozer,2010-01-14 18:54:00,896,There is something terribly wrong with this harvest... lol  Farm?
422315,Carp,2010-01-14 18:55:00,1488,"How can all those fish be coming out of that one shallow hole ? Even if they are guided in by the wooden posts, I can't understand how they all end up in that one spot in as great a number as we're seeing on the video. I guess these guys will have lots of time for the vodka next winter as there won't be any fish left to scoop out.  Yes, it could be some sort of fish farm to be producing that kind of harvest, but it's still hard to believe the number of fish. They're just piled on top of each other in that one spot. Seems like an endless supply of fish, but................."

422347,kickingfrog,2010-01-14 21:30:00,8333,Sustainable?
422354,purekgw,2010-01-14 21:41:00,585,now why cant they do that with asian carp
422355,Toronto_Angler,2010-01-14 21:46:00,698, Hopefully its just a fish farm as they said
422363,HTHM,2010-01-14 22:13:00,4082,When one looks at the fence that extends into the water I think it is a pretty good clue that it is a fish farm. I have seen similar setups by mussel farms in PEI.
422370,pike slayer,2010-01-14 22:28:00,1177,all i know is that you'll be a pro at cleaning fish by the time you get to the last one!

422499,Abberz,2010-01-15 03:31:00,140,Betcha they were pissed when they found out they were all pike and had a Y bone....couldn't imagine filleting that many pike.
422514,highdrifter,2010-01-15 04:42:00,2534,"Did I see some zander in there too??  Was thinking how it would just easier to do it in soft water, but then there'd be the issue of the fish spoiling..  Big honking pile of pike though.  HD"
422524,grt1,2010-01-15 06:23:00,638,"that just made me really sick to watch, with all the efforts we make for conservation of the species, I guess someone would say it's a cultural thing but unless they are feeding the entire population of their village, this is just disgusting."
422542,Paully,2010-01-15 11:06:00,712,  Im sure he's not just stuffing his fridge.
422560,Fish4Eyes,2010-01-15 12:38:00,1022,I stopped watching halfway.
422567,BITEME,2010-01-15 13:41:00,1968,I dont know what the big problam is have you ever seen a fleet of draggers in shore of the Coast of Nova Scotia rape and pilage the fishery thats what should be really getting your hair to stand up. Culling out a load of pike is okay and it does look to be a fish farm which the ocean is not  Just saying thats all Peter
422568,bigugli,2010-01-15 13:46:00,6138,European fish farming. Can hardly be called wasteful. People on this side of the world have obviously lost touch.  Better than a lot of N American netting operations where pike and other bycatch species lie in rotting piles on the shore. Saw enough of that up North.
422570,capt_hooked,2010-01-15 13:49:00,212,Just another typical day of fishing on Lake Nipissing..!  pass the fish crisp....!
