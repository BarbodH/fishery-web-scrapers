421492,Big Cliff,2010-01-12 10:08:00,6899,"I just had a look at the long range forecast for our area, temperatures way above normal for the next two weeks could make for some really dangerous conditions especially in areas where there is any current.  Long range forecast for Lindsay  Doesn't look like they are expecting much snow. Could make for some very comfortable fishing as long as the ice stays safe."
421495,Jer,2010-01-12 10:26:00,1426,"I wouldn't trust those ""14 day trend"" graphs very much. I check them regularly and it's surprising how the long range outlook can change drastically from day to day."
421496,lew,2010-01-12 10:31:00,12766,"Not being an ice fisherman Cliff, I'll take all the warm weather we can get  Actually, we've had a very tame winter down here in the Smoke so far this year with almost no snow, infact I've only shovelled maybe twice and both of those times was only an inch or 2 and even now there's only a couple inches on the ground.  I'm heading to Peterboro this morning to take care of some business then stopping into the local dealership to purchase a new snowblower & riding mower for my up-coming move north, but right now I'm thinking maybe I'll just order the mower and leave the blower till next year.........wishful thinking I spose"
421500,Jer,2010-01-12 11:18:00,1426,"I guess it would be asking too much for ice conditions around here to stay the same all winter. Right now, the ice is perfect for travel, 2 or 3 inches of snow. Easy walking, sledding, 4-wheeling and even driving where the ice is good and safe. I havent drilled a hole less than 12"" since opening day.  That guy who put his ATV through with his little kid under the Bridgenorth causeway must have been a complete moron. There is open water under the bridge all the time, only the sleds at speed ever attempt the crossing (and personally, I think they are a bit daft as well), but to attempt on a 4-wheeler (with your kid a board, no less) makes absolutely sense."
421535,chrispyke,2010-01-12 15:38:00,51,"You know what...I'm all ready a little concerned about the ice.  I was out on Sunday and noticed a couple of these hair line cracks showing up...that were not there the day before....and that is with the high temp of around -4.  My hut has lots of ice under it, much more than the 5"" close to shore....wouldn't want to punch my sled through the ice coming off the shore.  I think I'll be walking out a bit just to be safe.  BL"
421580,Sinker,2010-01-12 18:33:00,8692,"I don't trust TWN at all, when it comes to long range forcasts.  Try this one, they are usually pretty close, but their short term sucks.  http://www.accuweather.com/canada-forecast...;postalcode=K9V 1A3&metric=1&set=1  S."
421608,ciceri,2010-01-12 20:25:00,535,"They do that for the people that hate winter, they see that and get all excited, then boom, cold! Then it happens again, but boom, clipper drops a foot of snow."
421609,tributaryhunter,2010-01-12 20:25:00,108,"IF THOSE TEMPS HAPPEN I'LL BE BREAKING OUT THE FLOAT ROD AND HEADING TO THE GLEN, AND BY BY ICE GEAR"
421653,MCTFisher9120,2010-01-12 22:10:00,3761,Lets hope for the best and see how it plans out. Useually they are wrong about great summer weather in that long range. A few degrees above for a High temp might now be that bad if we stay below 0 and below -10 at night.  Wait and see I guess! 
421682,Beans,2010-01-12 23:10:00,3339,We had our Indian summer in November and it looks like our January thaw is on time...  A couple of years ago we had it in February and it made the Tyler Event iffy but we ended up in a deep freeze well before and the ice was good...
421826,Big Cliff,2010-01-13 12:27:00,6899,"That is a great link Sinker, thanks! Amazing how different the two of them are. Now, who do I believe?????"
421842,skeeter,2010-01-13 13:46:00,1907,big cliff i am always dead on for the weather i will tell you my secret: as for the 25th of january---- i will tell you on the 26th---LOL thats my secret way more accurate that way
421843,Beans,2010-01-13 13:49:00,3339,"Believe yourself Cliff...  If you look out the window and it is snowing...dig out the blower If it is raining...you might get wet...grab your brolly If the sun is shining and it is cold...wear a coat If the sun is shining and it is warm...ENJOY !!!  Now, how do I find out what the weather will be on the 6th February in London Ontario...  Son is getting married...didn't want his allergies to mess things up like in the summer time...  :whistling:"

421960,Cookslav,2010-01-13 18:20:00,1457,"Ah its not to bad?  Kitchener says no higher then 4 or 5 degrees for the 22nd and 23rd but overnight lows are well into the minus 4-5 range as well. As long as the lows stay in the negatives any damage done in the afternoon will quickly be refroze between 6pm and 6am The 22nd however shows a bit of rain in the forecast.... couple of days with +1 and +2 temps are no big deal, but with some rain and a couple of +5 days....it could get sketchy near shore.  I have my fingers crossed as I'm headed out on a trip that weekend..."
421971,ciceri,2010-01-13 18:39:00,535,"Long range already changed, nothing over 3*C for now."
422936,Cookslav,2010-01-16 11:40:00,1457,Wow....mother nature sure is moody http://www.theweathernetwork.com/fourteend...=qlink_lt_14day  Is Swear last night at midnight Thursday was a high of -2 and a low of -5 Now 6 hours later its gonna be 8 degrees with rain forecast.  That could be trouble with the last 5 days of already mild temps... Crossing my fingers but geeze talk about swinging the verdicts around LOL!
