422515,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-15 04:47:00,0,haven't fish in glynn but isnt it a laker lake?
422519,anders,2010-01-15 05:05:00,1168,"ive fished a number of times...gets hit pretty good in the winter, due to its closeness to the highway.  has specks and lakers in it, mostly lakers, but the numbers and sizes arent really there...you will get the odd decent sized fish, but with the pressure, its not that great.  I would rather hit Gammy before Treeby"

It's really nice, I've found the lake trout fishing pretty good although as already stated, close to the highway, but maybe that's what you are looking for."
