We went in the night before,  got up, had a nice breakfast and headed out to do some ice fishing. We went thru a narrows  a hundred yards from camp and literally right behind camp saw 2 black wolves had a Woodland Caribou down.    Here is a link to my blog with this story and a whole lot more   http://anglerskingdom.blogspot.com/  here is the link to this story  here is the link to Anglerskingdom.com   I don't have the video uploaded yet but check back I hope to soon. thanks kg"

422653,kgeary,2010-01-15 18:15:00,82,Thanks I think real nature is fascinating. Much of the pleasure I get from fishing is watching and learning what is occuring in nature that causes the fish to be doing whatever they may be doing. I call it Natures calendar and refer to it often. I'm teaching Hayden and Seanna all about it. It is a lifelong pursuit and what I feel the outdoors is all about. As they say it is the journey not to get too philisophical. BESIDES ITS JUST DARN NEAT
