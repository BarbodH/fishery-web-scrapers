422162,Leecher,2010-01-14 03:25:00,7832,"Since I could not access the site Sunday and Monday    decided to hit to work shop and create an oversize crank bait with rattles from the scrap pieces of pine I have....  Had to find 4 pieces of equal thickness for this project and it was a long process in the making  Once I found them, began putting it together...... here are the pieces that I worked with    Glued them together in pairs..... after carefully measuring and marking the outline proceeded on the band saw.... once that was done, drilled two holes on each halves for the rattles..... here's the result    Glued those two halves together and here's the result    Started molding the piece with the dremmel.... couple of pics....      Light sanding....    Now at this point the piece was not completely round so I had to improvise.... here's what I did      Some more sanding and was able to add the eyelets.... couple of pics.... result      Now I was able to proceed to the next step..... painting First coat of white    Then applied the color pattern    Finish product..... a few pics!!!      Along side the 3"" ones to give you perspective      Hope you enjoy!!! Leechman"

422312,Jet,2010-01-14 18:53:00,364,That would look great on the wall. Nice stuff Leechman. Do you have novelty hooks to add onto it?
422346,highdrifter,2010-01-14 21:19:00,2534,And all it took was some OFC downtime..  You're getting good at those bud!!  Did you tank test em??  HD
422373,Leecher,2010-01-14 22:31:00,7832," Thanks moparhawk!!!  I sure hope not..... ah well if it does,  will just have to make another   Thanks Jet!!!  It certainly would..... I ran out of hooks but will be adding #4 Excalibur treble on that baby   Thanks Fidel!!!  That's all it took    No tank test yet but come mid May and will be giving her a good workout..... unless there's someone that want to test it for me!!!"
422550,bushart,2010-01-15 12:06:00,2628,"Hey Leechman,  Only if you wish------If you have a bait that's ready for paint---drop one in the mail to me and I'll take a crack at painting one and I'll send it back to you.  A diving bait would give more detail than say a suick (usually mono color with spots)  Anyway it'll give me something different to do.  If interested pm me and I'll give you my postal address  Bushart"
422676,Leecher,2010-01-15 19:51:00,7832," Hey Bushart that's an offer I can't refuse     That's very generous of you  Which of the ones I made do you want to start with??  Crankbait 5"" or 3""  Spooks 3"", 4"" or 5""  just to name a few  Jacques"

422687,bushart,2010-01-15 20:23:00,2628,"Hi Jacques,  Fired you off a pm  Bushart"
422689,Leecher,2010-01-15 20:28:00,7832, Thanks phiphntek!!!  Yeah that looks close to that   Terry got your PM and sent you one.
