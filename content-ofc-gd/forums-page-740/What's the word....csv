I know there has been very little rain, but it has been above zero for three days now.  Who was out today?  What is the ice like today?  Any issues near shore?  Who's going out Saturday?"
422692,fishnsled,2010-01-15 20:45:00,3520,They were showing open water at the shoreline on the news last night.  I think it was Innisfil. I don't think I'd trust the main lake but Cooks and other first to freeze areas should be fine.
422695,Sinker,2010-01-15 20:48:00,8692,It will be fine. Below zero at night will freeze anything that thaws during the day. Just be careful coming off in the afternoon around shore. I'm sure some bozo will put a car or something thru the access this weekend.  S.

I'm sure they got all their 'spectacular"" footage at the very end of the day after everyone and their brother had run over the shore. I know personally, I'll be running my sled all over tomorrow. Both ATV's and sleds were running up and down IBP and BBP today. 6:30am tomorrow can't come fast enough!  Cheers, Colin"

422839,Sandbag,2010-01-16 02:59:00,533,"I fished Port Bolster today.  No issues with the ice.  Slight bit of slush on the top in the morning, but temp seemed to drop a bit during the day and it was crusting back up.  Solid 8"" everywhere we went today.  Cheers  Craig"
