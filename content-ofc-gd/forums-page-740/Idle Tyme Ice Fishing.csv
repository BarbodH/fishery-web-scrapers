421598,Fisherman,2010-01-12 19:43:00,7201,"Thanks for finding that Wayne..in addition don't forget extra paper towels and a couple of tea towels for drying your dishes/pots, one of the few things we were expected to bring.  They still have the nice wood burning stoves, we're going to bring a little extra dry hardwood, good for cooking up some lunch out in the hut.  Maybe a good lantern/flashlight for lighting up the hut in the early morning/late afternoon.  We're going next weekend, hopefully get a bunch of pics to post."

Heading up on Monday night for a few days and we choose to stay in one of their accommodation units then head out to the hut in the morning.  Fishing wasn't that good last year, but have done well the previous years.  Hope we have some good news for you when we get back."

422760,solopaddler,2010-01-16 00:03:00,8605,"Used to fish there all the time back when Ross owned it, always had a good time. Just had a quick peak at their website out of curiosity and there's a bunch of pic's of Ben Beattie in their ice fishing photo gallery from Jan/07. (Must still be good.  )"
422805,Woodsman,2010-01-16 01:24:00,1286,I also fished there with Ross(early to mid 80's). Good perch fishing in 35' each year. First year was a good deal. 2nd year he shafted us. We where charged the same rate as those in full cottages when we were put in the Doghouse(outhouse + no bedrooms). Ross & Betty shafted us on that trip & we never returned.  Rick
422811,buckster,2010-01-16 01:34:00,530,Fished it way back when ross was the owner also.    Fishing was great.  We targeted whities and did really well everytime.
