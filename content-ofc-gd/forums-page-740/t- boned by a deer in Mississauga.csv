422828,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-16 02:19:00,10439,"  They did when I smacked a 12 pointer near Luther Marsh. Deer did $7K worth of damage and was gone before I got stopped. After dealing with the cops I went looking with the dog, never did find him."
423028,Vtucciarone,2010-01-16 19:05:00,38,"I have seen deer on a few occasions in that area, mostly along the Etobicoke creek close to the golf course.My kids think it's kinda cool to see them so close to home."
