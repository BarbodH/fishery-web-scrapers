422372,icefisherman,2010-01-14 22:30:00,952,"OK,  One more days on Simcoe chasing the whities.... Started 7:30am....not the best bite out there but managed my limit by about 10:30am...same program/lure/depth. You know the story from my last few reports not to bother you with copy-cat reports Nice day with bunch of friends again....managed not to fall from the bucket this time ha ha ha. Everyone in the group got their limit though we had to move once. Anyhow....here is today's shot:    Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
422376,Leecher,2010-01-14 22:35:00,7832,You got to love it to limit out on whities in 3 hours Great job icefisherman and thanks for the report Leechman
422380,Roy,2010-01-14 22:45:00,13728,Congrats to you Emil! Fine looking fish for sure. I hear that Andy did well out there today too!
422381,bigugli,2010-01-14 22:46:00,6138,Nice looking whities.  You're making me drool.
422386,solopaddler,2010-01-14 23:01:00,8605,Wish I could have made it out with you. Must have been a comfortable day out there with the temps.
422390,BillM,2010-01-14 23:16:00,17367,Nice whities!!!
422396,anders,2010-01-14 23:29:00,1168,I really should make a trip down there one weekend for them  Nicely done
422505,Woodsman,2010-01-15 04:00:00,1286,Seems like you had quicker results than me. I managed to get my two off IBP. 1st at 11am & 2nd at 1pm. Bite was slow & soft where I was but started to pick up about 12:30 just before I limited out. Regular Williams & Rapala jigs only produced looks. For me a black & silver Meegs/BadBoyz tip with a minnow twitched on bottom was the ticket.  Rick
422533,Roninramirez,2010-01-15 09:31:00,19,I'm heading out to the 7th Line (Simcoe) on Saturday. I'll keep everyone posted on the conditions and if the fish are hitting  : )
