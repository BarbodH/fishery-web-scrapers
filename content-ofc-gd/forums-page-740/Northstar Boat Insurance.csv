I was wondering if anyone had any dealings with them? good or bad, I am currently with State Farm, and they are offering a pollciy with similar coverage for a couple hundred cheaper. They advertise as marine only and was hoping for some opinions, Thanks Moe"

Best bet is to just call them up and tell them exactly what you want, similar to your State Farm policy now and then compare. Make sure you ask questions if unsure and read the fine print on any brochure or policy....  Dirk."
308006,bigugli,2009-02-19 00:03:00,6138,They quoted me $100 more per annum than my State Farm policy  for near identical policies. Have to admit I've been well looked after by State Farm.
308009,danbouck,2009-02-19 00:19:00,4380,I've had insurance from them for over a year. Only thing I can tell you is that I never speak to them and they take $$$ from my account every month!
308076,moemoe,2009-02-19 02:22:00,352,"Thats the problem is that i too, feel well looked after with state farm, the problem is putting a  value on customer service and is it worth the extra doe....."

I said pardon? I guess that means the month or so I spent at the cottage in manitoulin last year, I wasn't covered, goes to show you REALLY have to read the fine print"
