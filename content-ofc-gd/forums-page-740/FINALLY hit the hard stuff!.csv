I was finally able to get out with Averie for our first Ice fishing session of 2010.  We decided to hit long point bay out of St. Williams, and my wife's cousin Darryl Propper taxied us out to the fishing grounds.  The guys at Grangers hooked us up with some primo minnow's and dropped us off amongst the city of ice huts.  Here's the details:  Ice: approx. 6 inches everywhere we drilled holes Depth: 5 Feet Water: Crystal Clear Temp: 33 Deg. Bait: Jigging Spoon tipped with a minnow & Micro Jigs Tipped with Minnow's and Gulp Fish fry  The jigging spoon would bring the perch in, and once they were under our hut they'd hit anything....very aggressive bite today...  I'll let the pix tell the story.  First off we forgot the most important piece of equipment - but Averie's Poppa was nice enough to deliver us our Ice Auger! LOL   Catching a ride out to the fishing grounds   The ride out   Setting up     Our Hut and Set up     Awaiting the bite...   And the fish     Here's a double header! lol one of many   A release shot   The kiss   Count 'em up - 5 fish all thinking about eating my bait - shot with the waterproof fuji   And our bounty for the day! lol 2 whole keepers, and one was a bullhead.   All in all we probably caught 50 to 60 fish or more, the average size was only 4 inches but the kid had a blast which is all that counts.  Good luck out there - and play safe.  Cheers, Ryan"

422857,Leecher,2010-01-16 03:23:00,7832,Great report and pics Ryan Looks like you kids had a blast out there!!! Averie's such a sweetheart    loved the pic of the kiss Thanks for sharing Jacques
422870,The Urban Fisherman,2010-01-16 03:46:00,2050," Hey Dano!  We were probably one of the closest huts to shore.  We stayed on the inside of the city of huts where the ice was still plenty safe.  A couple of Quads and a 1 hut went through way out towards the point.  There's been reports of 12 inches of ice, but Averie and I didn't find more then 6 inches if not less.  Lot's of fish, but all dinks!   Jacques!  We only fished ti'l just after lunch but had a blast for sure!  Thanks for the Gulp Fish Fry dude!  The perch ate them up, along with minnow heads and tails.  They weren't picky today, which kept me plenty busy.   I think I spent more time taking fish off Averies hook than fishing myself..."
422897,Leecher,2010-01-16 04:38:00,7832, Yeah tell me about it..... decided to leave my two jars at home cause I was using minnows today Wish I hadn't done that      would made a killing on them perch..... had a set line that got hit constantly throughout my stay.   Ah well kept me busy running for a while
422929,limeyangler,2010-01-16 11:12:00,5204,"I was wondering when Avery would finally drag you out.....lol  As per usual a priceless report. Wow...what an awesome fishing partner you got, i'll say it again....cant wait to get my boy out there.  Love the pics...the kiss is superb...but i must be getting old as it took me a while to actually see the perch in your waterproof piccy....lol...must replace the lens in my monacle.  Love your reports Ryan.....keep 'em coming.  Simon"
423038,The Urban Fisherman,2010-01-16 20:37:00,2050," Thanks Simon!  I've been telling her for weeks now that I'd take her out.  Before you know it you'll be icing eyes and gators with your boy!  When he's old enough to head out feel free to shoot me a PM and I'll try to give you some pointers on keeping the kids happy and loving the sport.  And no worries about not being able to spot the fish, I didn't have my camera on the right settings, but I didn't want to stick my arm back down the hole to try for a better picture! haha to cold for me.  Cheers, Ryan"
