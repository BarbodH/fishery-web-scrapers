I have developped a love for ice fishing lakers, i really look forward to ice season for this reason.  I invited a few friends for the trip and we got there around 7am.  We found 5-6 inches of black ice in most areas.  There was a TON of bait in the area, both herring and smelt and that made the vex difficult to use, but the fish were still around.  Between us we landed about 20 fish, mostly on a homemade jig I've been working on, but some on tubes and spoons.  Pretty slow overall, but some fish could be coaxed.  My buddy Mike landed a couple BEAUTIES!           "

422437,Skud,2010-01-15 01:10:00,739,The Lakers are really getting chunky with all the forage in Simcoe now. The one I kept yesterday was full of Emerald shiners. I thought it would be full of smelt.  Great job hammering them.
