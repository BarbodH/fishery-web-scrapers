This weeks episode was great since he challenged Dave Mercer and Dave kicked Scotts butt on Lake Erie and the Niagara River by over 4 lbs. Mind you conditions weren't the greatest. Way to go Dave.  I was wondering what people thought about having fishing tournaments where it is 1 on 1? Im sure lots of you watch poker and have seen some of the HEADS-UP Tournaments. Why not have fishing tournaments like that? Or do they allready? Iv√© never seen one run like that.  If you have a field of 100, seed everyone and have different brackets and just go one on one against another angler and have the winner advance to the next round. Do this until it is a HEADS-UP Challenge.  I knid of like the idea, that's why I love the Scott Martin Challenege so much.  Again, Congrats Dave Mercer......."
