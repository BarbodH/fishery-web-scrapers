286893,trophypikehunter,2009-01-02 12:03:00,89,"Went 2 for 3 on pike yesturday the first catch was on a tip-up baited with a 9 inch dead portuguese sardine, the second on a pink tube jig the third was also on a pink tube jig but lost him. The first pike almost spooled the hole tip-up the second one was caught in the hut, I felt a little nibble so I looked down the hole and there he was I watched him cruise around then he decided to take the jig as I'm watching so I let him then I set the hook that happened twice and I did see more under the hut wow I've never seen anything like it.. Heading back out today..."
