286218,diggyj,2008-12-31 18:58:00,548,"There is a Russian deli near Keele and Steeles called IDF, International Discount Foods. It is on steeles, 2777 Steeles West. They have some great pepperettes. They also have Turkey pepperettes if you need to watch your fat/calorie intake. A bit healthier. There prices are great to. Way cheaper for a big bag of theirs than a pack of Scneiders European Style pepperettes from the Superstore.  I stock up and freeze them. Taste great."
287035,huey graphite,2009-01-02 19:23:00,362,The best I have ever tried are made in Hamilton at Springer's Meats near Parkdale and Burlington street but can be purchased at the deli counter at Fortino's. Available in mild and hot. I prefer the hot but have to limit myself to no more than 2 in a day otherwise there is a price to be paid.
285200,HUKDONFAWNIX,2008-12-29 19:09:00,135,"Hi everyone,  I need some recommendations for a place that sells/makes pepperettes in the GTA (preferably Brampton/Mississauga area).  I have tried the ones that you can buy at Sobey's, Zehrs, Fortino's etc. and in my opinion they're no good and don't compare to the ones that I usually buy at the Sportsmen Show.  Unfortunately I can't remember any of the names of the businesses that are at the shows.  Does anyone know a shop I can buy some GOOD peperettes from?  I need to stock up for the ice fishing season.  Thanks in advance for your help."
285202,johnnyb,2008-12-29 19:18:00,3413,"KARPATY DELI.  It's a pretty popular polish deli that will give you a  good selection...they've expanded a lot recently, so they shouldn't be too hard to find in the phonebook.  Two locations I can think of are: Bovaird one block west of Hurontario, kitty-corner to Rona Hurontario just south of Dundas in the Price Chopper plaza.  There's also Starsky's at the corner of Winston Churchill and Dundas, in the Classic Bowl plaza....pretty much any european deli will give you lots of stuff to sample, till you find the one you like"
285210,fishing n autograph,2008-12-29 19:29:00,2540,The small deli counter in the Dixie outlet mall has great pepperettes...lots of selection.
285216,misfish,2008-12-29 19:36:00,29133,"Ok follow me here if ya can.LOL  You know where labarons is? Well if you do,then follow that road right past Labarons,dont stop at Labarons or you,ll have no cash for thier great peppertts and the rest of thier fine meats. It,s a hiden jewel.  Rabba,s use to be good too.  Boy if I go back to those foods,I,ll put 50 pounds on so fast.LOL  I do have to fight the urge off.  My fav from Brants was the polish sausage with cheese on a bun. DROOOOOLLLL"
285219,forrest,2008-12-29 19:44:00,1032,Try the original spicy smoke treat....summer sausage (wont fit in your pocket)...mennonites make good stuff.
285248,Big Cliff,2008-12-29 20:59:00,6899,"Well, if you intend to ""stock up"", Mennonites do make the best stuff. A trip up to Elmira or such would probably be worth while. I get all of mine made from venison, my cost including the pork is about $5.00 a lb but they are fantastic."
285255,misfish,2008-12-29 21:08:00,29133," Yeah,I was worried about them Cliff, with the power outage. Thought to offer to keep them here,but I couldnt promise they would still be here when the power came back on."
285267,Gerritt,2008-12-29 21:27:00,6129,"  Cliff is right about the mennonites making a good ""stick"".... however, that said... I do enjoy Schniders European Style as well..  Try the Mennonites though.... and dont forget an extra dry summer sausage!!!!  G"
285271,Big Cliff,2008-12-29 21:44:00,6899," Well, you'll just have to come for a visit I've got a package here with your name on it LOL!"
285274,Rich,2008-12-29 21:51:00,3927,I dunno about any homemade versions in your area but if you're stuck with the store bought stuff Pillers Hot is my favourite.
285288,Twocoda,2008-12-29 22:39:00,4130,IF you do plan on driving for quality....i agree the menonites are real good but the best i have ever eaten hail from Metzgers in Hensal....its a german recipe and have won awards for thier venison peps....ohh and the pepercorn summer sausage is to die for ......
285325,Leecher,2008-12-29 23:43:00,7832," Cliff,  I know what you mean.... got my deer burger meat done in pepperettes in one of the local butcher shop and man are they ever good.  Cost me $54.00 total.  Gave them 5lbs of deer meat and they added the same amount of porc meat.  Next year if I get another will definitely get pepperettes done with the deer burger meat."
285354,bigugli,2008-12-30 00:35:00,6138,"Some of the Germans used to go to the St. Lawrence farmers market on Saturdays.  Beyond that, nothing beats going to St Jacobs for dry hung summer sausage and peperettes."
285355,irishfield,2008-12-30 00:36:00,26272, You and me both Rich !  
285376,modny,2008-12-30 00:58:00,502,"pillers pepperonies are great  when we go up to mans club annual fishing /dude hangout (no homo) my buddy bring bagggs of pep sticks from somewhere. man they are great. like 30 at a time are stuck together, we just wear them around our necks for the consistant bite."
285389,misfish,2008-12-30 01:15:00,29133,"If you want quality,I mean real quality,head up here to Counrty meats. They are well known, and have the best beef bacon you will ever have.  Pepperettes,he has too. You did ask for the Toronto area first."
285401,bh87ss,2008-12-30 01:44:00,33,Check out Wally Parrs Sausage just south of Hamilton on Hwy # 6 just before you get into Caledonia. Makes the best pepps and has a lot of other stuff in the store. If anyone was ever in BPS he had Izumi sponser these last year and they sold them at the cash checK out.  I have also seen them throughout the GTA in variety stores.
285415,Mattones,2008-12-30 02:01:00,587,The MapleView mall is Burlington has a stand full of meat and loads of them of all kinds. They tend to show up around Christmas in the middle of the store. good price too.
285422,misfish,2008-12-30 02:06:00,29133,"Well, there ya go. Your question has been answered. Make yer pic.  Im hungry know,so Im off to have some crab dip."
285427,Leecher,2008-12-30 02:12:00,7832," Well, on that note, I think I'll have a deer pepperette or two"
285433,Mattones,2008-12-30 02:17:00,587,"Also if you have a Fortino's near you they sell JACK LINKS beef jerky, etc for 5 bucks! not 8 bucks like at BPS."
285567,Beans,2008-12-30 14:25:00,3339,"I am suprized Joey hasn't replied here extolling the virtues of the pepperettes up at Noelville...  If you ever make it to Lakair, give 'em a try !!!"
285669,bigugli,2008-12-30 17:57:00,6138," I forget the name of the place, either in Noelville or Monetville, but the pepperettes and the jerky are to die for. One of the Lions picks it up for our annual fishing trip."
285723,douG,2008-12-30 19:33:00,2693,"Cleo's Meats, Noelville, does some fine fine jerky."
285804,Greencoachdog,2008-12-30 23:00:00,8163,"Yeeah, those Noelville meat snacks are excellent!!!  There's another brand though, I don't know the name of them... but I've heard that when masticated properly, mixed with just the right amount of beer, and fermented in the stomach over night... make a helluva Walleye chum on the BOQ!!!  ... aint that right Slowpoke?!!!  ..."
