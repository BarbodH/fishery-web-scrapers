284157,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-26 23:54:00,3761,"I saw in the bass pro shops online flyer that there were rapala lures in the mercer magic color on sale. Does this color work , and also to those who went to the store, did you see any left..."
284244,lookinforwalleye,2008-12-27 03:28:00,4399,I caught my largest bass of the year on a Mercer`s magic.
284258,Skud,2008-12-27 04:02:00,739,I bought the DT10 and the Minnow Rap. I only have used the DT10 for a bit at Doe Lake in the summer and the Smallies really liked it.
284361,forrest,2008-12-27 16:41:00,1032,He has good colors on them.  The cool thing about those lures is that no one else can replicate them because of what makes them magic.  They have the good luck special magic Mercer spit locked inside each one of them.  forrest

285047,rbaquial,2008-12-29 10:05:00,968,"I've had a lot of success using colors similar to what ""Mercer's Magic"" has - Hence, I bought a few (4) of 'em for next season (Xraps and Xrap Shad) I hope next season I'll catch a nice Largie!"
285049,Guest skeeter99,2008-12-29 10:19:00,0,yeah it should work  it is basically the same colour as kevin vandam's sexy shad colour baits he released last year with a subtle difference

285276,Rich,2008-12-29 21:56:00,3927,They almost outfished my precious spinnerbaits one day on the bay. Almost.
286525,The Urban Fisherman,2009-01-01 10:55:00,2050," 2009 is the year I'll out-fish your precious spinnerbait! You just lucked onto that giant largemouth!  I've got a secret weapon this year...  Hey Mike - been busy buddy so I wasn't able to get back to you on this thread earlier....did you catch Dave's show this week?  It's a whole show dedicated to those baits!  Cheers, UF"

287071,diggyj,2009-01-02 21:40:00,548,"I was at Bass Pro this morning and the have lots left, unfortunately its only the MR-9(Minnow Rap) model. Everything else seems to be sold out. I have a DTF-7 and it works great for not only bass but also for perch. Dives up to 7 feet, so it works great in shallow water on Simcoe and Rice.  Yes they are still on sale, regular 7.79, now 5.94, something like that.  Here are some shots of small Simcoe perch from late in the season.  DIRK.......  "
287078,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-02 22:07:00,3761, Ya thats the only model i saw there to...o well im sure they will have more there soon.
287083,diggyj,2009-01-02 22:29:00,548,"There was a guy going up the aisle with the huge cart and was restocking the Rapalas so Im sure, they have more but just haven't got around to restocking.  PM Dave Mercer and tell him you are ticked that they are sold out. Maybe he'll send you one.  I would see if you can get a raincheck on the other ones while they are still on sale.  DIRK..."
