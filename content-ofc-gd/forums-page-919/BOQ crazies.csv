286662,JeffBornFishin,2009-01-01 19:31:00,260,Saw some portable ice huts on BOQ this am close to the bridge in Belleville and close to the open water.  Could not believe it  A tour over to Massasaugua point park and there were plenty of open spots there.  Must be a strong current going around that point.  Have not ice fished there since the 80's and was hoping to get there this winter some time.  Freeze up already
286737,fishindevil,2009-01-01 23:32:00,6254,"Thats crazy man !!! with all that rain they have all the dams on thew trent going wide open,and that will affect the bay of quinte big time !!! and yes massisauga point,has a very strong current going around it,so those guys fishing beside the open water,are just not being safe,and we just might be reading about them on the news !!!! most of the bay is still unsafe,thats what sam at carras in bellville was saying,lots of current everywhere except spots around big island...they said all around deseronto is all unsafe too,as well as long reach,so at least with all this recent cold it might make a few more spots at least safe to walk on !!! id rather be safe than stupid !!!! cheers"
286757,Hawg Hunter,2009-01-02 00:37:00,204,"yep your right bad spots all over the bay,the spot im fishing has 7"" of ice ill be putting huts out in the a.m i fish a non current area,most of the bay is not good at this point.  DON'T TAKE CHANCES THE EYES AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE   Hawg Hunter"
