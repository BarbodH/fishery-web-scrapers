286674,Cudz,2009-01-01 20:43:00,2652,I have been in Orlando enduring 80 degree temps for the past 10 days.  I will be driving home tomorrow and wondering if there is a chance that Simcoe is fishable? Cooks usually freezes sooner  so is that safe? Kempenfelt bay? When I ask about it being safe I mean 'take your kids on the ice safe' thanks
286675,Terry,2009-01-01 20:46:00,14456,"2 days ago a guy fell through 17ft of water out from hiway 89 must have been just north of 89, I was just south of 89 gilford road and  it wasn't too too bad  by now I would think checking as you walk the south part of cooks bay shouldn't be too bad but one must make up ones own mind as to what is safe"
286677,Cudz,2009-01-01 20:50:00,2652,Thanks that is not safe enough for me yet.

286806,Fang,2009-01-02 01:51:00,1330,"Was out off Gilford today drilled holes at 4 different locations. Started out due east of Kon Tikki and then headed north about 1/2 km. 1 spot was 4 inches of solid Black ice. Most we found was 8"" - 6"" of black and 2 inches of white"
