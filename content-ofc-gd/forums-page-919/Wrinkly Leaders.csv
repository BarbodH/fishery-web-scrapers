286686,MarcusDiGiovanni,2009-01-01 21:16:00,182,"Picked up some leaders at Bas Pro Shops   , Only because my mom didnt have time to drive me the extra distance to Wilsons, anyway the guy persuaded me to buy the White river leaders and tippet (store brand). I go to attach them to my line and there all wrikly, is this common, or should I get a diferent brand?, anyone know how to get em out?, I tried laying it our and putting books on em, tying it to a door and making it tight from my reel, nothings working and I need help!?"
286692,MarcusDiGiovanni,2009-01-01 21:45:00,182,nobody?
286695,irishfield,2009-01-01 21:51:00,26272,Once you start using them they will straighten out ! If you can't wait... clip them to a door top.. over top of a heating vent with a small weight on them.
286696,MarcusDiGiovanni,2009-01-01 21:52:00,182,Thank you
286700,danbo,2009-01-01 22:04:00,2646,Fold over a piece of leather & pinch the line. Then pull the leader slowly through to get the coils out.

286702,Dnthmn,2009-01-01 22:10:00,128,"Wrinkly as in it looks like a tight bend/fold was put into it when it was coiled?  If that's the case you're out of luck.  Head to Canadian Tire and pick up a few small spools of Stren Magnathin in 4# & 6#test diameters and use that for your leader for now. As long as your not tossing a big pike streamer or a #22 dry fly these will function just fine.  Also, let me know some more information so I can more easily point you in the correct direction. Info that will help me advise you is:  Length and weight of rod.  species of fish you will be targeting  Type and size of flies you plan on using, ie: #12 nymphs, or #18 dries etc."
286703,pirlo06,2009-01-01 22:11:00,17,"ive been fly fish'n my whole life and it takes a while to develope trust in a good leader, there is nothing worse than finally hooking that bow only to have your tippet snap, anyway there are only two brands that i fully trust and they are: frog hair(florocarb) and my favourite is 6lb. p-line(florocarb) these tippets wont let you down!!!"
286706,Spiel,2009-01-01 22:14:00,9065,"....My grandfather always swore by an old piece of bicycle inner tube (2"" square), just draw the leader through it gently, don't want to much friction which will create heat."
286708,danbo,2009-01-01 22:19:00,2646,OMG you guyz kill me..  http://flydepot.com/flyfishing/pn--cortlan...htener/pid--98/
286709,Dnthmn,2009-01-01 22:19:00,128, My turn to ask a question!!  Will this and the trick with the heating vent and the weight work if the tapered leader is kinked? or just coiled?  If they can be straightened after being kinked that would be a good bit of knowledge to have!!
286712,irishfield,2009-01-01 22:22:00,26272,I was suggesting it for coiled Dan... but I'd suspect some warm water would take a slight kink out as well !
286713,danbo,2009-01-01 22:23:00,2646,"No offense but i wouldn't chance heating it..all you need is a good steady pull at each end to stretch the line out. If it still has ""memory"" coils then use the leather or rubber tab..SLOWLY. Cheers,Dan'l"
286714,irishfield,2009-01-01 22:27:00,26272,"I don't take offence to anything around here Danbo....  Considering we're talking ""plastic"" here, not much you can hurt about it below 200*F... and that I have immense knowledge with, with over 23 years now owing a plastic injection moulding business."
286718,danbo,2009-01-01 22:37:00,2646,Dang!  I was a printer.. I really envy your Pilot license too! Happy New Year brother..
286722,Dnthmn,2009-01-01 22:41:00,128,"Thanks Guys,  I have a couple in my vest pocket that got badly kinked because I have yet to pick up a leader wallet (cooler got pushed up against the vest and the leaders were folded in half). Since I don't use them very often it hasn't been an issue for me but if I can save myself the money of buying some new ones for when I do want to toss out some dries that would be great.  I'll leave them stretched out for week or two and see what happens then try some heat. I was already figuring they were a lost cause anyway."
286738,MarcusDiGiovanni,2009-01-01 23:32:00,182,"It's all coiled, u know how its like in a circle when in the packet, well i take it out and its like a slinky, do u know what I mean, Ill get over to BPS when i have a chance and pick a leader straighner up, its only liek 7 bucks, but for now ill try these tricks"
286752,BillM,2009-01-02 00:19:00,17367,It's going to be coiled until you actually start casting with it.  Why worry about it now?  It's the dead of winter...
