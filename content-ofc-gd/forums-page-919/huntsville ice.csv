287077,johnnyb,2009-01-02 22:00:00,3413,Just spoke to my (cottage) neighbour who lives up there...most of the smaller lakes are good to go...but you're going to need an up to the minute report from someone who's seen it firsthand for the big ones. Try calling some of the local baitshops...they'll tell ya
