Had to sort through a lot of dinks though...was surprised to not see too many fish been caught by others and we must have passed by hundreds of fishermen...it was like mini-Toronto on the ice today. We were lucky as we had fish under our holes for most of the day.  Over 6""-7"" of ice where we were.  Time now to get ready for the big boys next weekend - lakers and whities. Hope we have enough ice in their grounds by next weekend.  One shot from today as it was nice day but very cold with the NW wind for most of the day.    Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
