286814,Fang,2009-01-02 02:17:00,1330,"Woke up a little later today than expected. Must have been the wine!!  Got to Hwy 400 bait store at 9:30am and picked up 2 scoops and off to Gilford to check what was going on first hand.  From the drive in off 89 you could see some portable huts way out. Good sign  Unloaded the sleigh and got the survival suit on and headed out. A decent spread of anglers out off Gilford, mainly due east and south of 89. Checked ice at 50 yards and found 8"" only 2"" of white. Walked out about 15 minutes to get closer to the pack and found 8"" again, mostly black ice. Was due east from Kon Tikki marina's big orange roof in about 14FOW (didn't hook up the flasher so just a guess) Picked up 2 9"" perch right away on gulp maggots on 2lb test and things got quite.  Moved about an hour later and saw more anglers spreading out to the north. Headed north another 15-20 minute walk to get closer to the second line and checked ice a few times. Good solid black ice all the way with a bit of white ice mixed in. Fished 2 more spots north of 89, last one was 4"" of black ice. Bite was very slow and 2lb rods with micro jigs minnows/maggots under a float got most attention  Headed back south for one last kick at the can and we found a bit of action. Brought home 12 9""ers and only had a few other dinks that got thrown back.  Lake was making ice good today, lots of groaning and cracking. One big crack shifted the lake quite a bit. When we got back to Gilford shore ice had folded over about a foot and there was some water.  Too lazy to upload the fish porn tonight but if temps hold there's some good ice there now. Lots of sleds running the shoreline and across the lake. Still some guys pushing it though out with argos and hauling big huts.  Had one guy drive right up between our holes on a quad pulling a hut and ask hows the fishing. Ice was cracking quite a bit as he drove in. I guess he got the hint when I walked away from him.  Portables and a few permanent huts out around the Lefroy and 3rd line but nothing out towards Roaches point.  Maybe back out on Sunday"

286817,Terry,2009-01-02 02:30:00,14456,good report but me need pictures I hope to get my skidoo out sunday
286835,Fang,2009-01-02 03:05:00,1330,"OK Terry  There was still some beer in the fridge. Here's a couple quick ones  My Frabill has been claimed by my son. Looks like I need to start shopping for another one   My new rod stands. Need some minor adjustments but worked out decent enough   After the knife comes out, a neat little bag of fillets in the fridge for tomorrow's dinner "
286845,Beats,2009-01-02 03:36:00,543,Great report.  Your rod holder design looks pretty cool.  I'm still waiting for more local ice before heading out for the first time this season.
286860,Skud,2009-01-02 04:52:00,739,I was out there today also from 11am untill 3pm.  The bite was very slow for us also. We moved locations about 8 times but could not find the Perch. Between two of us we only landed 8 fish with four being keepers.  Seen a few people getting into good numbers using minnows. There was about a dozen Quads burning around without incident so the weekend will be fine for machine travel. I will be out there again tomorrow around the same time.
286883,Terry,2009-01-02 10:25:00,14456,interesting looking rod stand
