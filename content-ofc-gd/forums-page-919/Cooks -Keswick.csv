287244,Headhunter,2009-01-03 14:34:00,5703,"Hit Cooks Bay yesterday, walking out from Keswick. Found 5 inches of good black ice and was jiggn to beat the band by 7:30am. Between my buddy and I we caught a total of around 200 Perch, mostly dinks and ended up taking home around 25. Most caught were in the 5-7 inch range, with a few genuine keeps. Buddy had the hot spot, 6 feet way from me, had non stop action in one hole for almost two hours. He'd drop the jiggin Rap to the bottom, turn over his bail and set the hook... they were all ready on the line. Hot bait was fire tiger Jiggin Rap with either a Power Maggot or a Luhr Jensen size 000 Jensenegg (plastic egg) on the bottom treble. Blue and silver Rap was also working well as well as a Swedish Pimple drop rig with a power maggot. It was a blast to get out on the ice again, but when everything slowed down, except the wind, at around noon, we hit the road. We could see guys fishing all over Cooks Bay, some as far up as Roches. Ice seems to be pretty good and still growing. Sorry, no pics, just thought I'd let everyone know about conditions. HH"
