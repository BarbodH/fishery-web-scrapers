Most places in the Niagara area have open water or very skinny ice. L. Gibson is now posted as a trespass zone for ice fishing. Rec canal is too skinny.  Shore ice on the Welland R. is still too iffy.  Finally found one old quarry pond with 3 1/2 to 5"" of black and white ice that has large schools of gills. Unfortunately the fish didn't seem to care too much for the Gulp maggots I was using. Got one OOS bass, and a few sunfish. the biggest being this fella.   Not much of a result for 3 hours, but it beats being cooped up inside. Besides it was a beautiful afternoon to get out."

Not bad for 3 hrs, i've done worse   I really hope you guys get some ice soon down there, the weather for you guys has been terrible from what i'm reading, hearing and watching on the news.   PS....Happy New Year!    Simon"
286950,Leecher,2009-01-02 15:38:00,7832,Great report and pics Bruce  You did a lot better then me..... could not get out yesterday.... had to visit my parents and in-laws.  Got back around 7:00pm  Good job and thanks for sharing Jacques
286951,Rich,2009-01-02 15:41:00,3927,"Man I'd be happy with that result. Been sitting on the same two schools of gills the last two days, plus a roaming pike and a school of jumbo perch.. NONE of which would touch any of my offerings. I don't know if I love the underwater camera so much anymore. It's great to see all the fish down there that won't bite. lol"

287068,tibbs,2009-01-02 21:34:00,650,Nice Job!  At least you got out and enjoyed the weather and caught something.
287129,rockfish,2009-01-03 01:01:00,91,"Think I know where u went Bruce, prob in the PC area.   Be careful out there if u are going by yourself and keep that compass and the ice spikes handy out on the bigger water.  "
