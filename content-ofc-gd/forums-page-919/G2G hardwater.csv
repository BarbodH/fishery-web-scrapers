286914,BUSTER,2009-01-02 14:14:00,1336,"we had some people interested in a get together on the ice. i was wondering if anyone was still willing to do this? we need to pick a lake?   BOQ,nipissing or other lake X? and a month? jan,feb,early march? then a date? 1st,2nd,3rd,4th weekend? we can do this without the help of any lodges,resturants,hut operators etc.... if we all pitch in with rides, cutting holes and maybe BBQ for food? Iam willing to travel up to 4hrs to any of these lakes and bring a crap load of gear to help out including porta-pottie for the weak!,BBQ for the hungry and a ski-doo for the lazy. and a couple heaters for the cold ones!  i could even get my hands on a party tent(not too huge but big enough).... ANYONE interested? as pointed out byBEANS OFC has fishing for tyler event on feb14th/2009 at innisfil beach lake simcoe so that lake and date are booked already for many members i hope!   1 members for nipissing(me) 2 members for BOQ"
286916,bigugli,2009-01-02 14:18:00,6138,"I'd be game for Simcoe, or even a lake in your backyard for that matter."
286922,Beans,2009-01-02 14:34:00,3339,We do have the OFC Fishing for Tyler event coming up on the 14 Feb 2009 at Innisfil Beach Park...  Motv8tr sure could use your help with that...
286924,BUSTER,2009-01-02 14:40:00,1336,"oh thats right its being pointed out last time,  with all due respect to the fishing for tyler event i'd like to try and do get together on a different lake and date then.  maybe we'll leave out simcoe and second wk of feb from the choices? no disrespect , iam sure some people are working very hard at making that event a success , this event could be a different choice to meet up for the members who are unable to attend fishing for tyler's event for some reason?...cheers"
286929,Handlebarz,2009-01-02 14:48:00,3790,The 14th of Feb is a hard sell to get away from here I would also be interested in a trip some where on another weekend. Brad if we ever get ice here we can get into some good eyes.
286931,Gerritt,2009-01-02 14:52:00,6129,I might be in depending on the weekend Brad. I gotta get the sled fixed before then.  G

286944,Stoty,2009-01-02 15:28:00,2910,Not to mention Valentine's day! That would be QUITE the doghouse to get out of.....if ya know what I mean.  I'd be interested in a Quinte G2G.
286967,e-z-out,2009-01-02 16:31:00,1052,I'd be interested in a Quinte G2G as well
287219,Handlebarz,2009-01-03 12:30:00,3790,BOQ Eh? That would be interesting a little far for one day but I might get away for a weekend heck that could just work out I would love to have some fun with them eyes up that way with the lack of eye fishing we have had here the last few years I would love to get into some nice big girls.
287221,BUSTER,2009-01-03 13:09:00,1336,"i plan on staying overnight, hopefully vehicle will be allowed onto the ice?"
