He's a great guy and is trying to do a lot for our sport. He hates snotty stuck up anglers who don't help people trying to become involved in the sport. We've been chatting online and talked about various subjects. He then tells me he started a fly fishing companyin 2001 , they have a line of about 8 rods I think and they look to be some quality rods. He also uns a guiding buisness in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Ninigret, Charlestown, and many other areas. Really what i'm trying to get at is if your ever looking for a guided trip look him up, and if your looking for new gear give Hush a try, I would have but I dont have a credit card and pay everthing in cash   . Hers a link to his website, its being revamped at the moment but it's still running, so sit tight till they add more features  . Check it out hes even got one spin casting rod.  website> http://www.hushfishing.com/index.htm  heres his youtube proflie> http://www.youtube.com/user/captfishshady  Prvidence Journal Interview> http://www.projo.com/sports/tommeade/sp_ou...Q1.35ef29e.html  Thanks for reading, Marcus"
