287327,Jeff_C,2009-01-03 19:04:00,50,"6 of us went out on foot yesterday morning in search of some eyes. Well, we found lots of them. Often we would be marking 3 at a time on the Vexilar. The bite was actually rather slow, but slowly we trickled away at them. One by one they came up and some of them actually came through the hole. A few others got free before making it through the whole, and of course the big ones got away...  Here is a short video of some clips from today. We had a lot of fun out there...  Enjoy!  Click Here to view the video.  We were out again today, and perhaps the next video you see will be better than this one.  Jeff"
