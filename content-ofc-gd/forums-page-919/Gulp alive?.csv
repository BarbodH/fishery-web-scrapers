My kids love them also. I would rip a small piece of the leech off for them to use with a hook and float rig, and they would catch over 20 fish on a single piece of this stuff. No more rebaiting messy worms for me. Bought the shiners also and the fall crappie went nuts on them. I am a believer. Have you seen the new gulp Alive products out there for this season. Nuclear something, they look like a craw that you would hook up to a flippin jig rig. They have changed the tub also. The Gulp people are definately expanding the product line for thee upcoming season."

To be fair I do not think I was fishing the leeches properly or in the areas they would be most effective.  I do think that live leeches would kick gulp leeches though because action on a live leeches is amazing.  Unfortunately the live leech would have every tiny fish that saw it tear it apart,  Gulp would survive the little fish onslaught and stay on the hook.  forrest"
