287002,richyb,2009-01-02 18:01:00,774,If he hit his head on the hole then you obviously seen the fish and know what type it was and how big he was ... so why are you asking us if you seen it ?  Big fish are fun on light rods
287006,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-02 18:06:00,3761,Man that sucks...We all have lost huge fish but to have the fight on camera   Better luck next time
287018,Fishing 24/7,2009-01-02 18:32:00,709,  sadly.... i didnt see him! i must have been    on the job!
287028,Rich,2009-01-02 19:05:00,3927,I second carp!
287030,ehg,2009-01-02 19:10:00,2666," I didn't see the jig hit you, your welcome for the responses"
287033,highdrifter,2009-01-02 19:22:00,2534,"This has got to be the longest runnning thread.. for a fish that god away!!  C'mon, give us a break already.  HD"
287318,profisher25,2009-01-03 18:27:00,185,"Aww man that sux... i don't think anyone would know what it was unless you pulled it out, what lake were you on??? it was most likely a pike or walleye though!"
286270,Fishing 24/7,2008-12-31 20:47:00,709,here is me beeing stupid and missing a BIG fish....  i didint see it and i forgot that i was fishing in 6 FOW!     with the head shakes im thinking a big pike BUT  theres big walleye and musky in there....  what do you guys think it was?
286273,highdrifter,2008-12-31 20:52:00,2534," Was that the Ottawa Riva??  I'm thinking prolly a northern.. or maby a politican turned into some x-files creature!!  Next time, get closer to the hole, point your rod tip down and let the fish run boy!"
286275,fishindevil,2008-12-31 20:54:00,6254,"Well based on the fact you were in a bay off the river,and you already caught one i would say a nice big P-I-K-E !!!!!  ...but you never know,could have been a legendary ottawa river CATFISH !!! too bad you lost hime,he was big for sure,youll get him next time....  ."
286277,Fishing 24/7,2008-12-31 20:57:00,709,BTW  i was jigging with a 1/4 once jig head  tiped with a white single talied mister twister . medium size..........
286281,Terry,2008-12-31 21:04:00,14456,was it caught last year
286284,Fishing 24/7,2008-12-31 21:07:00,709,  yes it was caught late winter last year !
286285,Twocoda,2008-12-31 21:07:00,4130,"thats why the sport isnt called "" catching"" better luck next time ...camera guy should have kept the camera on your face to see the expression when it went ""gone"""
286302,Leecher,2008-12-31 21:41:00,7832,"Good old Lac Leamy.... Kev, not being able to see you land it is pretty hard to tell but from the rod action, I'd say a big pike or musky for sure  Too bad the line snapped but like Highdrifter said, next time keep the rod tip down closer to the hole, that way you'll have a better chance of fighting it and may be land it"
286306,joco,2008-12-31 21:44:00,57,"IT WAS A PERCH.......big PERCH...   MUST HAVE BEEN A NICE PIKE OR MUSKY..I DONT THINK A WALLEYE.  BUT SHER WAS A NICE FISH.  like jaque said..next time keep the rod tip down closer to the hole, that way you'll have a better chance of fighting it and may be land it thumbsup_anim.gif ....  closer and try to keep the line in the middle off the hole.  joco"
286313,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-31 22:01:00,10439, I would say El Chupacabra by the looks of things.
286316,richyb,2008-12-31 22:08:00,774,GREAT WHITE !!!!!!!!      nah maybe not but i would bet money on a pike....  I have seen a 5 pounder pull that hard on light tackle
286323,forrest,2008-12-31 22:25:00,1032,I think it was a world record Sunfish....that record would have lasted a thousand years if you pulled it in!
286326,irishfield,2008-12-31 22:26:00,26272,Next time treat it like a Musky going under the boat.... rod tip IN the water..down the hole.
286328,glen,2008-12-31 22:31:00,2641,Maybe it was a carp.  The best fight i saw though the ice last year was a carp.
286515,Fishing 24/7,2009-01-01 06:48:00,709,  thats odd i didnt think carp were active during the winter!
286535,Rizzo,2009-01-01 13:23:00,4754,"head shakes like that I'd have to say musky. Like Wayne said, stick that rod as far down the hole as you can to keep the line off the ice. Makes for a far less interesting video but odds are you land a nice fish"
286545,Handlebarz,2009-01-01 14:14:00,3790,Well its been said here many time but i will say it again rod goes into the water if the fish is running like that you would be surprised at how sharp the ice is around a hole and will nick or cut the line in a hear beat that is why when we use tip ups we will hold the line over to the side away from the running fish.  Good luck this season maybe you can meet up wit hher again.
286570,Guest gbfisher,2009-01-01 15:34:00,0,"be the last time you fight a fish like that............  Next time,"
286647,Dano,2009-01-01 18:31:00,719,That's not a miss......lol
286716,ehg,2009-01-01 22:36:00,2666,I think you lost a pike or musky when it's teeth cut the line. Cool video anyways!
286731,irishfield,2009-01-01 23:05:00,26272,"  Yah.. at least Dano caught the ice after his ""miss"". lmao !"
286783,chickenhawk,2009-01-02 01:17:00,612,your all wrong.....it was a sea bass!
286794,Whitespinnerbait,2009-01-02 01:29:00,2038,"Well folks,,, I was the camerman I'm guessing  5lb Gator..   His mistake was trying to horse it in.."
286795,chickenhawk,2009-01-02 01:32:00,612,nope.....sea bass.....i'm stickin with it lol
286863,Fishing 24/7,2009-01-02 05:01:00,709,  befor saying i was ''horsing'' it in   try catching your first fish on a jigging rod.  only them i will listen to your advice.  thanx.  bye.    this was my first big fish. can you blame me ???  i was jigging in 6 FOW  no leader... the fish didnt cut the line  @ the end of the video you cant see the part where my jig hits me right in the face!  like you guys are saying i shoulda put my tip in the water when he was close.  the reason why i lost him he hit his head on the side of the hole!
