287369,Bernie,2009-01-03 21:05:00,3190,Been using 6lb test Fireline on Nipissing for many years now. The first few casts with fresh line it is a little stiff but once it breaks in I love it. Casts very good distance when fishing the reefs. If fishing around rough rocky bottom I cut off a couple feet every once in a while as it does tend to fray when rubbed. It's strong enough to straighten the hook on my jig if snagged. Also landed a large pike (figure somewhere around 20lbs) with no leader one day with it. Now if was fishing Quinte with the monster pickerel there it might be prudent to bump up the line strength a little.
287434,Markystang,2009-01-04 00:01:00,131,"The slip problem with braid is not when spooling it, but when fishing it. Because braid doesn't stretch, it can't ""bite"" into the spool and won't grip it. The whole mass of line will slip on the spool when trying to pull in a fish. I've seen it happen several times. The first time it happened to me, I thought my drag was giving me trouble. The solution? Either (1:) back it with a bit of mono, joined to the braid with a uni to uni or whatever, or (2:) apply a round of electrical or masking tape to the spool first so the braid has something to grip on. In my experience, either works. But I usually use the tape as it's much simpler than a knot for me."
287438,Greencoachdog,2009-01-04 00:09:00,8163, Read my post here!
287459,Markystang,2009-01-04 01:01:00,131,"I'm glad you've found something that works for works for you! Still, most braid manufacturers recommend tape or backing due to slippage, and my own experience confirms this. So I'm sticking with what works for me."
287471,Greencoachdog,2009-01-04 01:24:00,8163, I'm sorry to hear that.
287486,douG,2009-01-04 02:09:00,2693,"I don't see the downside to an inch of hockey tape, masking tape or duct tape.  I think we need more topics for debate if this one rises to the top."
287494,Greencoachdog,2009-01-04 02:23:00,8163, Yer right douG!  ... and I'm sooooo ashamed of myself.... I'll just go back to the shallow end of the pool now.....
287226,Greencoachdog,2009-01-03 13:39:00,8163, You may want to consider using the arbor knot to secure your line to your spool.  http://www.fintalk.com/fishing-knots/arbor-knot.html
287246,Radnine,2009-01-03 14:38:00,1538," Thanks for the info G, I only used the tape as I read (here somewhere) that Fireline slips on the spool, regardless of the knot used. At least that's what I thought was meant. Perhaps white hockey tape? The thought of going mono to the spool, then Fireline, then to a flouro leader sounds a bit like a boy scout's nightmare. Sometimes I long for the days when you just bought a spool of whatever was on sale and threw it on the reel and used it until it balled up so bad it was easier to start again than to untangle it. Too many choices makes my head hurt. Jim"
287251,Greencoachdog,2009-01-03 14:51:00,8163," I'd skip the tape altogether Jim, all lines will slip on the spool when you first begin to spool them up... but once you get a few good wraps on the spool, crank down the drag and pack it on there!!!"
287257,wallyboss,2009-01-03 15:09:00,1095,I didn't like the PowerPro at first until it got used a bit. Now that the color is gone it seems to cast further with less stiffness. Now I can't go without
287298,salmon,2009-01-03 17:31:00,334," Mine is totally opposite, all my power pro line frays. Every so often I have to trim 3-5 ft off the end.  Jose"
