286636,Handlebarz,2009-01-01 17:56:00,3790,"I went up to Angling Outfitters last week we get there I wanted to get a fish finder and maybe a GPS also well with good salesman ship I left with a new Lawerence 522c GPS combo now that I have it I need to make something to carry it for the winter I just got done messing around and have it all tucked away in a 16"" tool box it fits in just nice heck we had some leftover memory foam from our bed so I padded the box with it and hope it will also keep some of the cold off the battery.  My only problem is what to do with the transducer? I have a pic of what I want to do with it and that is mount it on the front of the box it will be just held on with wing nuts so I can take it off when moving or heading home then under the transducer I would place a ziploc freezer bag with antifreeze in it so that I dont have to place the transducer in the hole and I can also look at the bottom at new spots before I cut a hole.  Any thought on other ways to mount it better then this? thanks Mike        "
286645,BUSTER,2009-01-01 18:26:00,1336,nice mike!   i had put fish finder into a small-med sized cooler you know the ones that hold a 12 pk! it helped loads with keeping the battery from freexing.  if you need any help with it let me know ill scoot over and try it out with ya!
286649,Terry,2009-01-01 18:36:00,14456,"find that a big hunk of styrofoam  cut out works best it just sits in the water, once you get it so the transducer is strait ,  you will need to offset the transducer to get it to sit level but a little work it you will love it"
286652,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-01 18:43:00,10439,You can buy an Ice fishing transducer for that finder. Couple that with a Vexilar Foam Float and you're good to go.  Ice Ducer  Vexilar Float (1/2 way down page)
286653,drwxr,2009-01-01 18:47:00,453,"thats a cool idea with antifreeze, however cleaning the area of snow and making it level so your box sits properly wil take more time thatn to drill extra hole. besides you cant get good reading if the ice is not clear. sit down and  try to mcgiver something."
286659,irishfield,2009-01-01 19:03:00,26272,Mike.. if we wuz closer I'd just trade you the transducer I already have mounted to a square tube and it's cross pin... as I bought an ice transducer to use with mine.  I'll look for some pics or take some for you later today. Mine is a simple square alum tube with the trans riveted on and a piece of drill rod as a cross pin to hold it across the ice hole. Ron made his tubes a folding x to do the same thing.
286693,sonny,2009-01-01 21:45:00,511,"I'd definatly look into the ice transducer for that model,,,i'd also recommend the arm that vexilar has enabling you to position your transducer at an angle,,works great when fishing in a currant !"
286699,irishfield,2009-01-01 21:58:00,26272,"Here you go Mike. All I did was flatten the ""ears"" and turn the mount around... riveted to square tubing and drilled a hole in top for the cross pin."
286733,fishindevil,2009-01-01 23:11:00,6254,"Nice unit mike !!!..im sure you will figure it out,or wayne will give you a hand,dont worry you will have it all set for the rest of the winter in no time !!!! show us a few more pics when she is all finished ....cheers"
286855,Handlebarz,2009-01-02 04:32:00,3790,"thanks for the info guys Wayne I would take ya up on the offer well maybe you can just fly it down  I was thinking of the thread that Ron replied on where he had his set up but could not remember where I saw it? I like the idea and might just have to go with that one it would be easy to set up.  My daughter and I got out today for a bit I did not bring the finder but brought the Fish T.V. it was a blast to watch the perch and blue gill swimming around but no takers just one and a miss still a blast to watch them the water was very dirty with 1' being the best we could see good. the lights on the Camera are bright and make the jig almost glow down there and if it was 4-6"" away from the camera the flash was like having you spoon out in the bright sun light of summer."
287080,danbo,2009-01-02 22:19:00,2646,I found this at Ice Shanty site..a dollar store float!
