286445,Handlebarz,2009-01-01 03:56:00,3790,Good game that was a amazing game I think I will be watching it again it replays in HD at 11  or 12 I forget but it is worth the watch for sure not just because we won but it was a great game. Nothing beats watching the kids play they know what the game is all about.

286536,Rizzo,2009-01-01 13:26:00,4754,I didn't see the game (and I don't know the final score) but i heard at one point it was tied at fours. Kudos to the US for making a game of it.
286564,TerryC,2009-01-01 15:11:00,196,"A few years ago they said Pat Quinn couldn't motivate the young players on the Leafs, what a CROCK, he sure found a way to motivate the boys last night after a tough start. Kudos for hangin with Tokarski? after going down 3 zip. Great game.  GO CANADA GO.  Happy new year  Clarence"
286812,Stoty,2009-01-02 02:02:00,2910,Was there any doubt?!?!  We were just toying with them in the 1st period when they came out 3-0. hee hee hee.  I smell GOLD! (again)  That's what the Americans get for being cocky! Just like Don Cherry said today.....you DONT wake a sleeping dragon! Especially when they are wearing the Maple Leaf and carrying hockey sticks!
