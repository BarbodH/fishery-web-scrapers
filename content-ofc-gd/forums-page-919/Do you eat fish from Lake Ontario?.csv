286877,Bushrat24,2009-01-02 06:51:00,3,Just curious as to what you guys think about Lake Ontario and eating the fish in it?
286878,Dnthmn,2009-01-02 08:04:00,128,Not from lake Ontario simply because I don't get to fish there very often but I eat fish from Erie all the time.  here is a link that might interest you.  http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/envision/guide/index.htm  The PDF version of the guide for lake O is about halfway down the page.  Enjoy.
286881,xeon,2009-01-02 09:39:00,350,"Sure do. Ive eaten salmon, walleye, pike, perch, bass, whitefish all from Lake Ontario.  Just refer to the Guide to Eating Sportfish in Ontario. Also, keep in mind how close to Toronto you are, and use the guidelines for that if your close to it. And of course, dont eat too many giant fish from there, otherwise your going to have more mercury in you than a thermometer, more pesticide than an orchard, more PCBs..."
286888,Twocoda,2009-01-02 10:45:00,4130,i have eaten a 5 pound rainbow and 8 pound salmon from Lake Ontario.....but for the most part....its a lake you love to practice catch and release....( mostly cuz the fish can be huge and arent that tasty ) regardless of the lake they come from ...refer to the fish consumption guide..
