285571,silvio,2008-12-30 14:47:00,433,Be aware that the site is infected with some sort of virus or something. My anti virus keeps popping up saying it has block my computer from being attacked.  When I find a few minutes I will call John and find out whatâ€™s going on. Just a heads up so that no ones computers get attacked.
285577,kemper,2008-12-30 15:18:00,2232,Its about time something took that site down...   That could be a joke.... take it as you will
285580,kentooley,2008-12-30 15:26:00,208,Thax Sil  There has been a problem for some trying to register and logging in. I'm always logged in anyway and have every anti thing known to man. They are trying to figure it out . I have a buddy in BC that's a computer genius. Pm me here with details and I'll pass it on to him and see if he can help.
285583,silvio,2008-12-30 15:36:00,433,"No problem, my buddy tried to sign up and it didn't work for him aswell."
285584,forrest,2008-12-30 15:42:00,1032,"Thanks for the heads up!  They need to  do the responsible thing and replace it with a basic HTML page stating: ""site down for repairs"". It is irresponsible for them to leave it up in the state it is in.  forrest"
285947,BillM,2008-12-31 02:22:00,17367,I could login without to many issues about 3 weeks ago.  Now my account is inactive..  It needs some new forum software me thinks.
286078,Burtess,2008-12-31 13:35:00,901,I had no problems logging in or staying logged in but just realized last night thats where all the trojans were coming from that Symantec was blocking. Removed it from my list of home page sites... no more trojans....  Burt
286093,forrest,2008-12-31 14:11:00,1032,"I have been trying to register since b4 this thread.  Still can't.  Emailed the admin, no response.  Oh well.  forrest"
286711,silvio,2009-01-01 22:21:00,433,John has told me they are aware of the login in problem and are working on it.
286912,glockmeister,2009-01-02 14:08:00,30,"Have the administrators or symnatec fixed the problem with the trojans, etc?  Is the site safe to view?"
286918,Paulus,2009-01-02 14:29:00,522, I was on it earlier this morning and had no issues...  p.-
286952,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-02 15:43:00,10439,"  Paul, I was just there and it's still messed up."
286953,Gerritt,2009-01-02 15:44:00,6129,Perhaps you have all been banned for not editing the backgrounds of your pictures? LOL!
286982,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-02 17:31:00,10439," Backgrounds??? DOH, I thought they said Foregrounds!!!!  "
287091,glockmeister,2009-01-02 22:46:00,30,"So, after all the previous info, Are all the links on FF.NET safe to open, without fear of receiving a virus, trojan, etc? There doesn't appear to be any information on the the actual website regarding the previous problems."
287099,danbo,2009-01-02 23:16:00,2646,It works fine for me. Firefox + AVG..
287147,glockmeister,2009-01-03 02:05:00,30,"Well, I went through all the links on FF.NET and didn't have any problems with trojans,etc. Everything is back to ""normal."""
287170,aniceguy,2009-01-03 03:06:00,1094,I still get the malicious tool kit warning....so you have a patch or the variant bury's in your computer for a rainlyday
287185,forrest,2009-01-03 03:45:00,1032,"I have had Norton give false positives.  BUT  I have had Norton flag viruses that it could not name but detected.  Other AV found nothing.  Months later every AV was flagging the file. (sometimes Norton is behind other AVs)  My professional advice is stay clear of the site and ask the admin to make a statement on the issue. Something is triggering Norton and it should be identified specifically.  If the admin cannot state what is triggering Norton then the site should be considered hostile. Configuring NOrton to trust the site is not the solution.  Assume your PC is infected and don't bank on it until......  forrest  PS: what is Stoty saying?  He is a site builder, not that he should give free diagnostics and solve the ff.net issue for their admins."
