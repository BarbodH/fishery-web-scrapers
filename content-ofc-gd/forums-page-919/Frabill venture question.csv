286960,duckdog,2009-01-02 16:16:00,162,Anyone tow these with there snowmobile? as in made a tow bar or installed one? I am not interested in speed with it just loading my gear on it and going? Would it drag under the snow to much?
286964,Mike the Pike,2009-01-02 16:26:00,3421,I would not tow this from a snowmobile if you go too fast you will surely melt the plastic.  I have the same hut and I only tow it by hand.Buy a huge otter 2 ice fishing sled and throw it on top install the metal guides and you will have no issues.  I once towed a plastic ice fishing sled behind a pick up truck once and the friction melted the plastic full of holes but I managed to repair it with some silicone.  Mike
