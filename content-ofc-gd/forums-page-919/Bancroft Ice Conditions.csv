276707,Ramble,2008-12-07 17:09:00,713,As the title suggests im wondering about how the ice is doing up around Bancroft. ANy body hear or know anything?  -R-
276792,JeffBornFishin,2008-12-07 20:20:00,260,"As of last night Paudash was still almost wide open.  Can't speak for the smaller lakes, but with the recent warmer weather I would bet it is in the same shape.  Now if we get the low temps they are forecasting for tonight through tuesday it will help a lot.  Stay safe."
276830,John Bacon,2008-12-07 22:25:00,3277,I don't think there was any safe ice on Baptiste as of last week end.
276998,singingdog,2008-12-08 11:06:00,1047,"If Haliburton is any comparison, I wouldn't be venturing out soon. Larger lakes are still mostly open. Smaller lakes have been frozen for 2 weeks, but not very solid."
281928,Ramble,2008-12-20 07:48:00,713,I'm hearing a few whispers the ice might be good to go this week. Anyone have any updates to add?  Thanks  -Dave
283436,Ramble,2008-12-24 02:07:00,713,"I made it up North of madoc today. Didnt goas faras Bancroft. Small-Medium sized lake, 8.5 inches of ice. 3 inches off good black stuff 2 inches black/whiteice blend and 3 inches of white. 1 spot had about 1 inch of water half way though the ice. We didnt get more then 100 yards offshore. deepest spot was 25-30 feet.  -R-"

286435,Ramble,2009-01-01 03:27:00,713,"Oh i suppose i should mention I was talking to the lady at Hook Line and Sinker in Madoc when i got my minnows. Lots of folks heading to the small lakes around bancroft for splake, and Stoco for walleye. Not many people on Moira yet, but there is a few out their. More open water in the area where 62 crosses the lake then last week when i went by.  Be safe out their.  -R-"

I have been watching the views on the thread and people are reading so i figured i would keep posting what i have found lol.  All of the thicknesses are measured with a tape, they are not estimates.  Might be hitting BoQ tomorrow morning for some perch, we'll see.  Thanks for the post irish. A little company is always nice.  -Dave"

287279,jwl,2009-01-03 16:31:00,1056,"thanks for the update on that area Ramble On, the folks at that bait shop are pretty good people too, they generally will have minnows a good hunk of the winter, I am there a couple days a week in the summer  can't wait until I get the chance to head to my trailer for some winter fun"
