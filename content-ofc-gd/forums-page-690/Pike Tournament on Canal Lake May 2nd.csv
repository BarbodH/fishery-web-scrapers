460095,wil wegman,2010-04-26 22:13:00,17,"Just a reminder of the pike tournament on canal lake this coming Sunday May 2nd.   The Aurora Bassmasters are pleased to announce their inaugural Canal Lake early season pike tournament on Sunday May 2nd , 2010 out of Sunset Cove Marina near Bolsover Ontario. The attached entry form can be used by anglers to register for this unprecedented early season pike fishing competition.  “In January 2010 the Ministry of Natural Resources opened up Fisheries Management Zone 17 in the Kawartha Lakes for year-round pike fishing,” explained Herb Quan president of the Aurora Bassmasters. One of the prime reasons to allow for this increased fishing opportunity centred around the fact that northern pike are not native to the Kawartha Lakes and their presence is known to result in declines within the native muskie population. “Canal Lake was the first lake within the Kawartha chain to see northern pike and ever since their numbers have flourished there while muskie have plummeted. Anglers who participate in this early season pike tournament can expect some incredible action and a chance to fish competitively before the traditional pike opener in southern Ontario a week later on the 2nd Saturday in May”, concluded Quan.  The event will start at 7am and all waters from the host site of Sunset Cove Marina up through Canal Lake will be open for competitors. Entry fees are $110 – including a separate BIG FISH pot. 80% Paybacks to the anglers will apply. You can register and pay the morning of the event (beginning at 6am).  Although the Aurora Bassmasters are proud members of the Ontario BASS Federation Nation, this is an “Open Event” meaning entry is not limited just to those belonging to this grass roots organization.  The club will use proceeds to further their conservation initiatives which in 2010 will include: The award winning Lake Simcoe Bass Tagging Research Project, the Earth Week Roadside Clean-Up Day, the Keffers Shoreline Rehabilitation Project, the Pefferlaw and Beaver Rivers Fisheries Monitoring Project, The Fairy Lake Pike Transfer Project, and the Lake Simcoe Bass Nesting Enhancement Project.  “For the past several years, the Aurora Bassmasters have been proud to host Canada’s premier one day bass fishing tournament – the Bass Pro Shops Lake Simcoe Open at the end of October. With this new pike venture, we are starting off small just like we did with that bass tournament but hope that by offering one of the earliest tournaments of the season on a premier pike fishery like Canal Lake, that we can quickly grow this event”, concluded Dave Meadows the tournament director for the club.   -       30 - For more information please contact:  Dave Meadows  [email protected]  Or visit: www.aurorabass.com"
