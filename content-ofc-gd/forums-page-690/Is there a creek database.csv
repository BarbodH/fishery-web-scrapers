462293,Mykester,2010-05-03 02:11:00,241,There's a very small creek that I can't seem to find the name of. It even shows up on google maps so it's not like it's some random stream. DOes the MNR have a database of these tribs?

462441,fish_finder,2010-05-03 14:35:00,370,"you can find several ""atlas"" type documents on the mnr site.  They'll give you GPS co-ords and other info such as that.  Here's one, and there are many more.  I've found them useful personally.  MNR Brown Trout Atlas"
462500,Mykester,2010-05-03 16:38:00,241, I am a local...  Anyways thanks fish_finder. I did some more googling and I only found one site that mentions that creek and it was just some bike trail site.
