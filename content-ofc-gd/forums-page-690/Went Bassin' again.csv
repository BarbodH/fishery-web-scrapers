Went looking again, but knowing the bass were biting in the same lake only devoted 2 hrs to the (again unsuccessful) search.  We caught around ten each, best one at 18"" went to my buddy Al, but i got a nice 17"" one and a 29"" northern to get team 5 a few points...gawd  knows we need 'em with all the trout being entered recently.  Anyway....nothing complicated as bait, orange and chartruese thumper tail shads on a jig was all that was needed, find the shorelines where the White Pine is growing....usually where the rocky/boulders are...and voila...BASS!...great day out.   My buddy Al had not fished for bass in over 20yrs...he had a blast....now converted...lol...he's been to the tackle shop and is busy buying braid, mepps spinners and and beetlespins for our next bassin adventure tomorrow morning on a lake i've been saying i'd like to put the boat into every year but always dont....soooo...till tomorrow heres the vid and pics we managed to get before rain forced the camera back into shelter....lol.   ANOTHER FUN DAY!   <object width=""480"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""   A FEW PICCIES          "
