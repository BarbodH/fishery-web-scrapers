462183,spinnerbaitking,2010-05-02 23:24:00,1622,Had it out on Silver Lake today 36 mph so far what do you think Richard 
462185,danbouck,2010-05-02 23:25:00,4380,Looks good!
462187,misfish,2010-05-02 23:27:00,29133,Enjoy.  Nice clean looking ride.
462191,Terry,2010-05-02 23:33:00,14456,nice and DC....  I bet a 90hp would make that thing fly
462195,Twocoda,2010-05-02 23:35:00,4130,looks good ...36 miles on the speedo or on the gps??? where are ya going to mount the downriggers when ya get bored with the inland lakes?  i always wondered what was in silver lake was told it was really shallow
462197,TC1OZ,2010-05-02 23:37:00,987,"NICE DUDE!!! Looks new to me!  I just leak tested my banger, only one tiny leak to fix and she'll be out on the water  :D I'm going electric only hahaha."
462198,skeeter,2010-05-02 23:39:00,1907,i think you made a good choice with that SKEETER boat!
462228,danbouck,2010-05-03 00:24:00,4380, Until you find a motor like I did for $150
462233,spinnerbaitking,2010-05-03 00:42:00,1622,"Not with me in it I don't fly   36mph on the GPS, I think the cable on the downriggers would be to thick to cast especially with frogs & Silver Lake is over 70' deep Richard"
462234,Leecher,2010-05-03 00:44:00,7832,Looks in very good shape Congrats spinnerbaitking Leechman
462244,Curtis,2010-05-03 01:11:00,83,that boats a sweet ride! i would like to get my hands on one of her siblings
462263,Mike the Pike,2010-05-03 01:37:00,3421,Very nice ride looks very clean.
462266,skeeter,2010-05-03 01:43:00,1907,dont forget that you need your operators card for your banger as soon as you put the electric motor on it !!!!!!!!!!
462324,HTHM,2010-05-03 03:06:00,4082,"Sniff, it's not a Ranger. Nice ride, for a bug   , but a 90 'ill make her fly!"
462334,TC1OZ,2010-05-03 03:15:00,987, You got me.. if I can find anything that's 9.9 HP or less for $150 or less sure.  But I don't see it happening lol!  Maybe your supreme Kijiji skills can hook me up!
462356,fish_fishburn,2010-05-03 09:26:00,1311,"When my brother and I first started tourney fishing back in the early 90's he bought the same boat. It had a Johnson 100GT on it and it was quick. It was rated for a 90 but handled the 100 no problem, no chine walking what so ever. Think it did about 55mph. We had alot of fun in that boat. Skeeter make an awesome boat."
462373,solopaddler,2010-05-03 11:37:00,8605,"Nice boat, congrat's! You might be underpowered though. On the gps I do 32mph in my 16' Lund with 40hp tiller. (That's with a heavy load)"
462377,aniceguy,2010-05-03 12:02:00,1094,nice boat looks really clean!! enjoy
462379,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-03 12:05:00,3761,"Awesome boat man, your going to love it o so much!  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
462390,bassdreamer,2010-05-03 12:43:00,128,"Nice looking boat Spinnerbaitking,You can't go wrong with a Skeeter. I have a ss90 since 1997 with a 60 yammy on it !  Have fun !!!"
462396,danbouck,2010-05-03 12:49:00,4380, I keep an eye out. I got a 5.5
