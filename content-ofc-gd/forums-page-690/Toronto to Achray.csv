I have been looking to have everything prepared well before the trip which is why I am starting this now.  I read it will take about 6 hours from the GTA? Whats the best route to take? I figure a few of you have been up this way in the past and could help me out.  I found this on the internet. which sounds neat although they were going to Pembroke which is in the area somewhat it seems.

I find 41 to be the hwy that never ends for some reason. niether route is significantly faster than the other.  I live on the Achray rd and watch the masses move in every Fri afternoon then witness the mass exodus out on Sun afternoon......not that it is over run with people or anything, just a lot more traffic than we are used to in these parts!lol. Have a great trip. honk on your way by.  Cheers"
