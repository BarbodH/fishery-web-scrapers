462524,The Urban Fisherman,2010-05-03 17:25:00,2050,"I just thought I'd take 5 minutes during my lunch break and fire off some pictures of what I've been doing the past month, and why I haven't posted any fishing reports.  The boat hasn't even seen water yet this year, and it'll be a couple more weeks yet before that happens.  We decided to give our house a face lift this spring, by adding a front deck, a new door and we still have to re-surface the wood around the door and over the window's.  I've got ZERO formal training with woodworking or building, but grew up helping my old man with everything he did.  At the time I cursed him because I wanted to go hang out with my friends, but I've saved thousands of dollars in labor costs since we started renovating our house...so I have to say thanks to my old man for that!  I originally planned to build this deck during my holidays, but we were pounded with rain, hail and snow all week so it turned into an evening and weekend project.  I think it turned out pretty good for a Rookie, especially considering the fact that it's 57' wide by 8 feet deep.  Ground work   Frame Done   Started skirting - I had the boards pressed right up against one another and they shrunk and ended up with an 1/8th inch or more gap between each one   Railling Done     Front Steps done   Side Steps done       Whole deck   Now we just have to re-do around the front door and above the window's and my house facelift is done.. Next up, dry wall, mudding and painting.  It never ends.  If you're thinking about doing a deck, and are at least a little comfortable with basic woodworking tools, you can do this yourself and save a pile of money!  I think I deserve a few weekends on the water after this one!  Cheers, Ryan"

462550,solopaddler,2010-05-03 18:10:00,8605,You may be in the wrong line of work.  Looks great!
462567,Harrison,2010-05-03 18:51:00,2202,"Looks awesome bud, I learnt alot from my gramps.  Appears you moved the gas meter.  I have a landscaping biz on the side and sometimes the meters can be the biggest pain in the butt."
462580,Dondorfish,2010-05-03 19:32:00,1000,Looks great - I would just be worried about the frost heaving the deck blocks and taking your porch roof with it. I think I would have opted for sonotubes and cement - otherwise looks awsome!  Don
462581,aplumma,2010-05-03 19:33:00,6896,Nice job Ryan looks like a great job and I am sure it comes with lots of bonus fishing points for the summer.   Art
462594,shane,2010-05-03 20:09:00,652,"Looks good...but, before you start packing up your fishing gear, aren't you going to paint it?  That would make it look really good."
462658,Handlebarz,2010-05-03 22:54:00,3790,Great work Ryan it looks like a great place to sit and talk fishing
