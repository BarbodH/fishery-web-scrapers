461970,JohnF,2010-05-01 23:48:00,3494,OK. I'm gonna be teaching for two weeks in Stoney Creek soon. Any suggestions for the quickest route to Queenston just south of Green coming from Brantford direction at 7:30 - 8 a.m. I've got a hunch Queenston all the way down from Redhill ain't gonna be fast then.  Thanks JF

462106,JohnF,2010-05-02 17:32:00,3494, Someone else suggested taking King off the Redhill down to Green. Our classrooms are right at Green on Queenston.  JF
462108,HTHM,2010-05-02 17:34:00,4082,That'll work too
462358,Spiel,2010-05-03 09:29:00,9065,"  That'd likely be the best option.  403 to the Linc, then down the Redhill, exit east on King to Green.   "
462360,solopaddler,2010-05-03 09:33:00,8605," Yes absolutely, this is the best route. (The Linc/Redhill always move's well even at rush hour)"
