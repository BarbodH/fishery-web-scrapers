Any feed back on either boat would be excellent. Maybe someone one hear has one and is thinking of selling or downsizing,if so I am interested. thanks"
462398,Raf,2010-05-03 12:55:00,3495,"Lund & Crestliner -- two of the best names in boat manufacturers out there.  I doubt you'd go wrong with either.  I've been fishing off the back of an Explorer SS 1675 for the past 5 or 6 years.   Very wide, very stable & handles rough water great.  It has lots of storage space and ample room for 3 guys to fish out of easily."
462401,Skud,2010-05-03 13:16:00,739,I faced the same choice five years ago when I bought new. Both are great boats. I went with the Lund and never regretted it.

462469,Sandman,2010-05-03 15:15:00,8,"I have a fishawk 1700 side console with a 90 yammy (opted for yamaha over merc), no complaints. There both great boats."
462474,fish_fishburn,2010-05-03 15:28:00,1311,Both are great boats. Princecraft  I had issues with them on there hull warranty and promised I would give them free advertising forever.
462483,bucktail,2010-05-03 15:51:00,1857,"Tough choice, but one that you cant go wrong either way.. I have a 17 ft Lund and love it, tough as nails and a yammy on the back."
462492,cranks bait,2010-05-03 16:18:00,721,"I too went though this delema a few years ago.  Both are nice boats.  However I bought the Lund Explorer 1675 SS with a 75 E-tec on the back.  I found the lund to have more storage space and a bit more stable.  I have not thought ever that I made the wrong decision.  I use the boat for pleasure cruising, fishing and hunting.  I did upgrade to the double bunk galvinized trailer and the 24 volt 70 lbs trolling motor on the front."
462517,Spiel,2010-05-03 17:03:00,9065,"Can't comment on the Fishhawk but I do have a Lund 1700 explorer, 75 tiller, incredibly wide boat at 91.5""s"
462539,Gutpile,2010-05-03 17:55:00,27,I have a 2004 1750 fishhawk with a 90 2 stroke Merc and love it.  Nice wide beam and very stable.  It comes out of the hole and on plane very quickly.  It handles great.  Highly recommend.
462641,Radnine,2010-05-03 22:09:00,1538,"When you talk about boats like this you are essentially asking people which of their kids they prefer. I guess that there is a real difference here (as opposed to asking for a preference between Lund and Alumacraft) and that is riveted vs. welded. And that will be debated all day long. I own a 1600 Fishhawk and think the world of it. And when I was shopping, there were definite differences between the 16 foot Lund and the 16 foot Crestliner. You can PM me if you want to hear them, cause I am not interested in a pissing match. You can't go wrong with either and that is the truth. It just depends if you want to be a complete label....(slang word for a prostitute) or not. OOPS, I mean do you like riveted boats or welded boats. Good Luck!! Jim"
462692,beertech,2010-05-04 00:40:00,118,"You might want to look at the alumacraft aswell,  Very nice boats and you can;t put any motor you want on it.   A lund is a lund though quality boat. princraft I don;t know too much about so can;t comment"
462753,dakota,2010-05-04 02:46:00,7,I bought the lund 3 yrs ago and never regreted it  a very stable and solid boat. Rob
462765,mrpike,2010-05-04 03:35:00,151,I have a 17 ft lund  explorer side console with a 115 hp 4 stroke mercury. And I love it and it is the second lund boat that I have owned . AND it will be up for sale very soon do to poor health reasons.  END OF MAY is my guess. THE package was bought new in 2006
462769,fishnsled,2010-05-04 03:51:00,3520,"As others have said, both are a good boat.  I've got a Fishhawk 1750 and so far so good. (2002) The tinny I had before was riveted and I didn't want to have to deal with loose or missing rivets again, so I opted for a welded hull."
