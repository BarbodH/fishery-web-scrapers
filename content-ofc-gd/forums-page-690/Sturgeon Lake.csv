461126,skeeter,2010-04-29 03:17:00,1907,well now you guys have me pumped for the opener. thats the same weekend i open up the trailer on chemong. guess im going to have to throw the boat in and see them up close. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
462351,T Fisher,2010-05-03 05:38:00,139,bump.......... still not sure
460672,T Fisher,2010-04-28 01:42:00,139,"Can anyone tell me where the Ops/Fenolen town line is from the boat launch in Lindsay down river from the fast water. I've looked every where, asked the local bait shops, called the MNR and have 3 different locations. The locals say the old train tracks, one said anything north of the hydro line that sits 300 m north of the old tracks."
460753,Big Cliff,2010-04-28 09:38:00,6899, I had the same question a couple of years ago and finally went and got an old survey. It is the old train tracks!
460786,fish-miester,2010-04-28 13:04:00,864,I have been wondering the same thing ! i thought it was both the roads... but thats pretty hard to mark from the water
460790,GBW,2010-04-28 13:17:00,8460,"The MNR told me that ""The OPS/Fenelon boundary is in a line with Pickeral Point road, across the water to Ken Reid rd."".  Is that where that trackes are?"
460822,ecmilley,2010-04-28 14:34:00,2163,"i was told the same thing, pickeral point rd and ken reid rds are the boundry but it's enforced at the train track as a landmark that can be seen. to confusing at times i just fish from snug harbour and up"
460851,GBW,2010-04-28 16:09:00,8460,where is the damn dam anyway?
460855,fish-miester,2010-04-28 16:17:00,864, ha the Dam is right in lindsay.. right off kent and Lindsay street..
460860,GBW,2010-04-28 16:24:00,8460,"I see it now, thanks. I ask as I have never fished there as I'm sure there are many others here too that haven't."
460862,fish-miester,2010-04-28 16:29:00,864,well honestly I could probably throw a rock at it from where im sitting right this second.. and hit it.. I have only fished it a few times last fall right before walleye was done.. and well saw a few wallie's caught.. MTB and his friend caught a ling there.. other then that.. have heard good reviews.. which I am excited about walleye opener for..
460865,GBW,2010-04-28 16:46:00,8460,"Do it, throw a rock!  Ya might hit MTB, LOL!"
460867,fish-miester,2010-04-28 17:02:00,864,haha if I knew he was over there I'd try it.. but I know for a fact hes fishin in souther Durham region for Bows lol
460869,GBW,2010-04-28 17:10:00,8460,Then if I see him (as that's where I'll be soon) I'll toss him in the river for the crazy amount of fishing he does...
460870,fish-miester,2010-04-28 17:12:00,864,haha please take pictures!..
460873,MCTFisher9120,2010-04-28 17:18:00,3761," Yup your right, our buddy Steve managed a half dozen walleye at night in the 14-18"" range...Very cold crappy weather in the fall there but if you stick it out u will catch them..jig and minnow works well there.  As for the spring opening I'm not sure on what to use but I hear lot's, too many people fish it.  O well."
460875,fish-miester,2010-04-28 17:20:00,864,Mike.. arnt you supose to be playin in the creeks? jeeze..
460876,MCTFisher9120,2010-04-28 17:20:00,3761,Wait now you two...i had to read the other comments and there will be no throwing of me in the river or rocks at my hear haha. Alex buddy the Rainbows seemed to move down further last night...all that's up by me in the creek are suckers(caught 1 of them).  Right when I figure the fish out they dissapear...
460880,ciceri,2010-04-28 17:26:00,535,"Midnight of opener at the locks you hear, zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz splash as all the lines are casted and lures hit the water. Catch your limit easy."
460885,fish-miester,2010-04-28 17:37:00,864,Ciceri.. cya down there..
460891,slammer442,2010-04-28 18:02:00,5, at the dam in linsay
460892,slammer442,2010-04-28 18:03:00,5,
460901,jimmer,2010-04-28 18:31:00,2730,Remember Walleye open later at the dam in Lindsay. Not on May 8th like the lakes in the Kawarthas.
460906,ciceri,2010-04-28 18:57:00,535," Yeaup, they got the signs posted up on the rails."
460936,GBW,2010-04-28 20:53:00,8460,"No wonder I didn't find him, he was back home by 1:20... Just messing with ya Mike.  I wouldn't have pushed you in the river.  I may have however tried to trip you up a bit but never push..."
460938,GBW,2010-04-28 20:55:00,8460,May 14th if I read the regs right last time I looked...
461006,Big Cliff,2010-04-29 00:52:00,6899,"That is the way I read it, first Friday after the opening for zone 17."
