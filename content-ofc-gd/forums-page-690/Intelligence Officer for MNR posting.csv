462602,Michael_Brown,2010-05-03 20:44:00,411,http://www.gojobs.gov.on.ca/Preview.aspx?JobID=27358  The MNR has posted an Intelligence Investigations Officer opportunity for the Pembrooke area. I guess they are trying to find someone intelligent from Pembroke.  Sounds like an advanced CO position.  Good Luck to any that may be interested.
