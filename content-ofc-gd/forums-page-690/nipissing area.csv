462135,pikeguy,2010-05-02 20:02:00,195,So i was just wondering how many members are from around the nippising area???  As i have notice in the reply's that members are knowledgeable of the surrounding area..  Not just the main popular spots. But Laving and Verner. Can not remember who it was but the talked about Rice bay and Duck creek Arbour creek.   Just curious let me know  please

I have a trailer in Sturgeon Falls so I now fish the west end, and french river areas. Easy trips out to the Sturgeon river, Cache Bay,  Iron Island, Goose Islands, and Sandy Island.  I would like to do an area meet and greet some time. Would be nice to get a few local board members together."

462316,Nipfisher,2010-05-03 02:41:00,2449," Randy,  I'll be at Glenrock for 5 straight weeks from July 28-Sept 6th. Maybe by then we'll have enough water to have my boat in my slip. Any of thise weekends are good for me."
