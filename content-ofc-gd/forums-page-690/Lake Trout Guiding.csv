He want's to take myself and a friend of my choice out on Lake Ontario for a morning or afternoon of Guided Lake Trout fishing. Were not interested in keeping any fish, just want to hear of some good Guides that we can call up.  Share any personal experiences and let me know what prices are like for 3 people.  Thanks, hoping to hear some good feedback.  Thanks, Mike"
