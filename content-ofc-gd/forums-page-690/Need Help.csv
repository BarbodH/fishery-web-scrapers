I'm clearly terrible at it as I don't ever seem to catch anything.  Where should I go, and what should I use? I'm in deperate need of catching something. Any help on this matter would be greatly appreciated."
461876,bushart,2010-05-01 17:09:00,2628,Funny I used to say the exact same thing about women  Well you pose a rather broad question but here's something----Walk the local piers and your creeks and rivers right now while the steelhead are runnin----watch closely ask questions of those you meet---very few anglers I've met streamside are rude--most helpful
