A couple of small issues had to be dealt with from last year with it (carb and fuel tank venting) and now she runs awesome!! Too bad the weather wasn't cooperating but that's ok. This weekend, I'm going fishing!! For my evenings this week, I have to finish waxing the topside of the gelcoat and install the new stereo and I'll be good to go for the Kawartha's or GBay. Just a side note, if anyone is looking for a good used boat and wants to deal with someone who has no problem taking ownership of problems, Ben's Marine on Hwy 11 in Oro Medonte is the place to go. Ben is a good guy, and really wants to make sure you are happy. he has a really nice '03 Skeeter bass boat with a Yammie 225 that looks real sweet!! If I could only convince the wife..........."
