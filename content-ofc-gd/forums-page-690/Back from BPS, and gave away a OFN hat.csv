462057,Muskieman,2010-05-02 14:38:00,2472,"I left Sturgeon Falls @ 7:00 am Saturday morning with the family with a few stops an the way made our way to BPS arriving @ 10:15 am..we did good time.  I shopped 'til my heart was content all the while keeping my eyes peeled   for an OFNer... I spent 2.5 hours in there and didn't spot anyone nor was I approached by any.  Final bill of sale was 402.06$.  With my OFC hat in hand,I then made my way to Chuck-E-Cheese's for lunch and games with the kids.. We all had a great time.  We then jumped in the car to make our way up to the 400 Market  ( I missed the Essa Rd exit.. sorry BrianB)  After a pony ride for Megan at the 400 we made our way inside to buy some home decor stuff and junk.  After walking around in the market for a while .. we ended up sitting down for a break.  A booth caught my eye  .. It was a tackle shop.  I walked in and guess what was written on the wall???  here's a picture.   I really felt like I was being set up for something  As I turned around to look for a camera crew..a guy came up to me and said "" I read your post and figured you'd be rolling through at anytime so I just drew up this sign 10 minutes ago""  It was ""CHEAP TACKLE"" a board member here on OFC and owner of the tackle shop.  I then went back to the car to get the OFC hat and presented it to him.     WOW!!!  OFC IS EVERYWHERE!!!!  All in all we had a fantastic time yesterday and the next time I go down ..I'll bring another OFC hat along and see if I can actually meet a OFNer at BPS.  Randy "

462073,SlowPoke,2010-05-02 15:32:00,2984,Great story Randy! I remember the time I walked into the post office and saw my name on the wall... got the heck outta there!
462083,TC1OZ,2010-05-02 15:50:00,987,That's too funny! I was going to hit up the bass pro on my way up to my buddies cottage but unless the traffic is bad we'll be long gone before 9 AM.
462092,grt1,2010-05-02 16:28:00,638,"I was going past Bass Pro on Wednesday and wanted to stop but the limo service driver said he wouldn't but  he did say he would slow down so I could jump out on the 400.  Obviously he thought his passengers were more important than fishing, what a poor attitude."
462100,Syn,2010-05-02 17:13:00,519,haha I love these forum threads. It restores my faith in humanity. Thanks for the feel good story Randy.
462167,cheaptackle,2010-05-02 22:14:00,849,Randy it was a pleasure to meet & chat with you and your family.  Muchas Gracias for the hat - it's on display until I have a moment of weakness & start wearing it (don't wanna ruin the new hat look all at once!) Hope you can stop by again at the end of the month!  Michael

462414,bigbuck,2010-05-03 13:49:00,2449,"By the time we hit the road we were running late, I didn't pass BPS until 11:30 and I was supposed to be in Oro Medonte at 12:00 to pick up the boat."
462621,Muskieman,2010-05-03 21:15:00,2472,"Now maybe for the next time ... I can get T.J 's dad to give me another hat.  What do you guys think of a ""Meet Randy from Sturgeon @ BPS and learn how to swear in French and get a free OFC hat"" contest???  Randy "
