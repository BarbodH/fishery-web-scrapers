462286,Stern Rules,2010-05-03 02:05:00,342,I can't believe you actually saved them instead of putting them in the trash. Good to see someone's thinking of the environment. Kudos.

462328,TC1OZ,2010-05-03 03:10:00,987,Hazardous Waste Materials Day has it!  Check your local trash collection leaflet for the dates in your area. (2010 should of come to you recently)  I like to leave them around my house randomly so when I'm out of batteries and on the hunt... I at least entertain myself for a while.  *Yes I found one* *damn its dead* *puts back where he found*  
462342,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-05-03 03:31:00,1107, LMAO that's exactly what I used to do now I through them in the garage so I don't do that.
462355,fish_fishburn,2010-05-03 09:17:00,1311,I only use rechargeable now.
462406,Fish Farmer,2010-05-03 13:34:00,2234,"Through them in the garbage. Thats were they'll end up, in land fill. Market Place did a show, they tracked were old battery's went. Out the back door   and in the garbage dump."
462447,danbouck,2010-05-03 14:42:00,4380," About 30-50 cents a pound, I use a lot at work and usually get about $150/month from scrapping them."
462560,jimmer,2010-05-03 18:22:00,2730,I just dropped off at bunch at our local landfill.  They collect hazardous waste every Saturday morning.
462564,TC1OZ,2010-05-03 18:29:00,987," Whats $150 worth of batteries look like Dan... I'm now interested... What about like power supply batteries and things like that? or is this just AAA, AA batteries you are recycling...  Because I know I could collect tons... My work pays people to take them away lol."
462565,Roy,2010-05-03 18:34:00,13728," I'm guessing you'd need 4,000 AA batteries. Weigh a dozen batteries and take it from there."
462568,danbouck,2010-05-03 18:51:00,4380, 75 of these    Pay me to take them away
