461661,JohnF,2010-04-30 19:40:00,3494,I may never get to tournament fish but at least the name will be out there in my place.    Just in case you can't read it for the glare    I'm not sure it has much direct benefit for me (or the business) but I thought it might be kinda fun to at least get to ride along at the tourneys. Watch for me at the launches.  JF

461683,e-z-out,2010-04-30 20:37:00,1052,Good stuff John
461687,Roy,2010-04-30 20:46:00,13728,"Good on ya John. I'm glad you're Peak because ""Tungsten, discover the feel"" just sounds bad."
461690,JohnF,2010-04-30 21:00:00,3494," We thought of it as a company name but decided it was just too clumsy for the telephone receptionists. Peak has a nice easy cadence, doncha think?  JF"
461691,Roy,2010-04-30 21:05:00,13728,Oh hell yeah! It certainly piqued my interest!

462042,JohnF,2010-05-02 12:43:00,3494, Absolutely not! Just trying to get my schedule caught up. Hopefully it'll be soon because the end of the month is very busy and then I'm in Stoney Creek teaching for two weeks. I'll pm you.  JF

462410,Harrison,2010-05-03 13:40:00,2202,"Good for you John, it's an expensive game and any little support truly helps the team out!  And you would be suprised the ""exposure"" that decal will get you."
