462556,POLLIWOGG,2010-05-03 18:20:00,835,"I would make it legal to fish in Ontario, run the ministry on the money saved from no longer administering the fishing license, enforcing the fishing license and court cost of prosecuting the fishing license along with revenue from the provincial parks that now goes to general rev. or demand the ministry be financed from general rev. like it should be.  ""If its there for everyone's use it should be paid for by everyone""  If everything is to be paid for by user fees it creates the cost of administration. If we are going the route of user fees how about a golfers license, or a skiers license,  that would be a great cash grab and I'm sure we could think up a hundred more.  Why is it that everybody complains about the boaters card being a cash grab and the fishing license that is admittedly a cash grab, they want to increase it.  I just think it should be legal to fish."

These tags would have to be purchased in order to bring home gamefish(not panfish) species.All revenues back into enforcement. Declare the brook trout a threatened species and stop the destruction of southern ontarios coldwater resource by greedy developers who use the OMB to trod roughshod over efforts to stop them from doing just that."

I would hire a bunch of really smart people like biologists and wildlife enforcement specialists and then listen to their advice and let them do their job.  I would eliminate the non-resident conservation license and just have one non-resident license. All canadians would be considered resident.  I would increase stumpage and aggregate fees to an acceptable level for utilizing our resources.  I would focus on habitat restoration or creation to encourage natural reproduction of native species.  I would stop stocking the great lakes...unless the baitfish populations rebound. No sense stocking fish that have nothing to eat.  I would invest heavily in youth outdoor recruitment activities. If we don't get them hunting and fishing young then our numbers will continue to fall.  I would eliminate most of middle management and increase the field staff.  I would stop listening to the rumblings of small interest groups and make decisions based on the resource.  I would stop all use of consultants, they waste money to tell you what your staff already know.  I would ban the use of the words ""splake"" or ""F1 Backcross"" and only stock species able to reproduce if conditions allow.  I would introduce and enforce regulations concerning the fish and wildlife imports through the pet trade.  I would release several adult bull elk tags to a lottery system draw and use the funds to support the species program. You would have to hunt with a CO as your guide. The CO would be selected by a lottery draw as well. This should improve CO moral and ensure accurate animal selection.  I would eliminate the turkey hunting course for new hunters and combine it with the hunter education program.  I would sell tags for sturgeon fishing in areas where the population is sustainable. The funds raised would be returned to a restoration program.  I would bring back the spring bear hunt.  I would replace the deer and turkey tag system. If the population is to be reduced then allow two/three turkeys or deer per hunter for one fee. Instead of selling extra deer for $38.50.  I would replace computer answering services with real people.  Probably just as well I don't get placed in charge, people fear change.  These are just my opinions but I do think that they do a good job with what they have.  Funding cuts by every political party who has been in power makes it tough to operate effectively."

461798,timmeh,2010-05-01 03:25:00,609,"1. I would create more no kill zones, ie. single barbless hooks, no organic bait, all catch and release. Every major river would have a section designated as the Grand currently has. I would create small sections like this on the larger lakes as well. Prime spawning and juvenile grounds would be targeted for protection.  2. A major change to trout limits. Combined limit for all trout in southern ontario would be 3 instead of the current 5. And the individual limits for all trout would be reduced to 2. No one needs 5 brook trout out of fragile streams every weekend.  3. Make the conservation license a true conservation license. You have a harvest limit of 0 for all fish. If you'd like to harvest, buy a sportfishing licence.  4. Any persons who wish to keep fish regardless of age must have a sportfish licence. If you're under 18 and want to catch and release you may do so freely, however if you chose to harvest you buy the license. Reasoning for this is quite simple; i'm sick of watching families with 1 adult and 9 kids keeping 10 limits of fish with the 1 license they have between them. This is a problem at conservation areas in southern Ontario. If a child is keeping fish it's probably not his choice, his parents are likely telling him to, so they can foot the bill for his license."

462084,capt_hooked,2010-05-02 16:01:00,212,"Good post here...!  I agreed with Rick O. License fees should be the same for both resident and non-resident. We want to encourage Americans to come up here and spend their money in our Country. My experience is that most Americans appreciate our natural resources and are less likely to abuse these resources than some of our own residents.  The monies raised by fishing license sells were intended to be used for management on the fisheries. The fact is that these monies are being used for MNR employee salaries and retirement funds. We need to insure that fishing license money is dedicated to fishery management.  I would strongly encourage re-stocking programs.  I hope that there are some MNR area managers reading this post! It would do them good.  There are some great ideas here.  As for the spring bear hunt:  I take offence that we all agreed on this issue. I would question the validity of ""baiting"" bears as a true hunt! This is not hunting.  This is shooting a bear that is coming for his nightly dinner that has been set out for him for the last 2 weeks. The whole thing is orchestrated. And I am suspicious that most people's view in this subject is tainted by a fear of bears. (I know I will be in trouble for this one!)  Cormorants are ugly!   the cap't"

Pay the land claims for the First Nations and then level the playing field such that their is one law for everyone. Purchase the commercial netting licenses for all of Ontario once you've settled the Land Claims.  Restore the spring bear hunt (and I don't even bear hunt). I wasn't big on baiting bears either until I got educated on the subject. It helps the hunter determine the sex and the size of the bear.  I'd make Mike Brown the Minister!  oggie

What would I do if I was the Minister in charge of the MNR? Well, I would probably change the opening day of trout fishing to later in the year to allow the fish to do their thing without threat of being caught. I'd also increase, quite substancially the fines attributed to poaching. I can probably think of more, but I'll open it up to the forum and see what you good folks think. HH"

I would look at seasons as well, ensuring those fish that are spawning are protected ad allowed to do their thing.  I would ensure that all anglers need to have some basic understanding for fish ID, and understanding of our regulations BEFORE they are issued their license. That way locals and new comers to Canada cannot claim they did not understand, dont speak english etc... I think this will reduce poaching as they cannot claim ignorance as an excuse.  I would ensure polluters are dealt with swiftly and radically. Business would be held accountable for the damage they are doing to our lakes and rivers.
