462068,danbouck,2010-05-02 15:06:00,4380,"Thankyou, now I wonder if there is a cabin still available"
462069,skeeter,2010-05-02 15:08:00,1907,"cabin? only Roy stays in a cabin, real fishermen use tents."
462070,danbouck,2010-05-02 15:14:00,4380, I'm sick of tents

462154,Ron,2010-05-02 21:16:00,1683,"Oh man!!!  I'm gonna be stuck in Nipigon from the 17th to the 27th... Bummer......  I'd much sooner be up at Lakair with a bunch of hoolagins talking about how to PP people who fall asleep while in the middle of a conversation instead. Seriously though, if I had to choose, I would still take up Nipigon Brookies, Pike and Walleye. I'm even missing out on season opener of Muskie for this trip.  One of these years I'm gonna make it to another one of these G2 summits."
462367,fish_fishburn,2010-05-03 10:36:00,1311,I might try to make it since it is just a few hours away from me. Is tent camping allowed there?
462371,skeeter,2010-05-03 11:20:00,1907,"yes tenting is allowed. there are a lot of people that tent it from OFC, like me!"
462432,Rich Clemens,2010-05-03 14:19:00,3131,Patsy and I will be in cabin 5 - just out from the main lodge. Be sure to stop by sometime and say HI. We're arriving on Thursday the 17th - and staying the following week.
462442,danbouck,2010-05-03 14:37:00,4380,I'm booked in June 17th to the 20th  Edit: Cottage #7
