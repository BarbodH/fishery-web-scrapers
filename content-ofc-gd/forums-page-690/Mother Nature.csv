Figured it had something to do with the fact that it is my only day off during our spring busy season. Got the 14 fter last September...starting to think I should have been looking for an 18 fter."

462547,The JAY,2010-05-03 18:02:00,239,"Well, there's gotta be a starting point for twofootitis.... I've got no boat, and I'm pretty sure 2 feet wouldn't cut it.....   I think 12 is a good starting number, I'll go with that..."
