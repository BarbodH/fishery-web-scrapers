461715,landry,2010-04-30 23:03:00,1005,I have a 2007 trailer with stone chips galore and rust has started. It is not deep - just surface - so I was hoping I could sand/grind it off and prep it myself then have it sprayed by someone as a side job. i live in Cambridge. Anyone on this board do auto painting on the side or know anyone who does this. Need some connections and pricing. Thanks a ton. It is an ez loader for a 16' crestliner - not much to paint at all - a tiny fraction of a car job. Any advice too?????? Landry
461723,skeeter,2010-04-30 23:39:00,1907,tremclad spray paint. save your money for more fishing equipment  besides the trailer is under the boat most of the time and no one will see it.
461728,Muskieman,2010-05-01 00:09:00,2472,  Skeeter has hit the nail on the head!!!!  Get some sandpaper some primer and a roll of masking tape some paint to match and you're good to go.  RFS 
461742,archer379,2010-05-01 00:43:00,277,try looking on kijji i had to paint part of my truck and found a guy there who was cheap
461767,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-01 01:40:00,10439,"You wanna stop it from chipping as badly, after you prep and before painting coat the trailer frame with rubberized rocker guard (you can get it at CT). It adds a little elasticity under the paint and it helps to cut down on chipping. It is used to protect the rockers and lower doors on a lot of cars. And as a bigger bonus it's 50% off right now.  Rocker Guard"
461776,landry,2010-05-01 02:19:00,1005,i like the idea of adding a coating to prevent further chipping. Great idea:) Landry
461814,wormdunker,2010-05-01 10:12:00,1711,"I just finished sanding & painting my ATV trailer.  I used a spray can product called ""zero rust"" which is available at a body shop supplier.  The sales person told me it is a better product than Tremclad.  u might want to search this product.  1 issue is, it is not availble in gloss finish - only flat.  Good luck"
461869,irishfield,2010-05-01 16:23:00,26272,"Sell the trailer and order a galvanized one to replace it. Cost difference, of the purchase and sale, may cover a strip and paint..... and you'll never have to do it again !"
461878,Dave Bailey,2010-05-01 17:13:00,1641,"Take this for what it's worth because I don't own a boat, but I'm thinking that the best coating for a trailer might be the same stuff that is used as a spray-in bed liner for pick-up trucks. It's about as tough as you can get."
461899,blue pickeral,2010-05-01 19:03:00,267,"Larry's Economy Sandblasting - Magnetewan, ON - he's in the book. $350.00 for complete sand blast and 3 coats of Tremclad."
461995,danc,2010-05-02 01:35:00,4677, Yup Wayne. A galvanized trailer was top of my list before the boat itself.
461997,irishfield,2010-05-02 01:44:00,26272,Me tooo !
461998,Spiel,2010-05-02 01:45:00,9065,"  Ditto for me. The galv trailer was a no brainer, don't look so nice at first but it'll far outlast a painted one.  If you can afford to sell I'd say upgrade."
462026,HTHM,2010-05-02 03:49:00,4082,Get it powder coated!
462027,irishfield,2010-05-02 03:53:00,26272,You know anyone that can put an entire trailer through an oven Albert?
462039,HTHM,2010-05-02 12:20:00,4082,"There is a shop here in Hamilton that can do it. I don't remember the name, but I did get pricing. They are on Arvin ave."
462055,fish_fishburn,2010-05-02 14:19:00,1311,"I did my 5000lb trailer 4 years ago when I bought it. It was all rusty and looked awfull. I spent a couple evenings scraping loose scale off and a quick sand and wipe down with an old towel and I was ready tp paint.  I then bought a gallon of Tremclad paint, think it was about 40.00, and about 15,or 20 for a decent brush and gave it a coat making sure to get in all the cracks and crevices. The next day I gave it a finishing coat.  There is still no rust showing on that trailer, oh yeah I did it in recreational white (color).  I should of did the wheels too cause they look like crap now. The finished job looked okay, and I'm happy with it. I would not do my bassboat trailer that way, haha, but anything is better than rust haha cause Rust Never Sleeps, (love that song)."
