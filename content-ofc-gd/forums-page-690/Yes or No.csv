462269,Gerritt,2010-05-03 01:45:00,6129,"While I did not know it, it was funny though!  it is very simple to embed video here. when you are watching the Youtube clip under it you will see a little button called EMBED click it. You will see a box containing the code needed to embed a video here. copy the code. post it into your thread. Now be sure you are using the full thread editor, the little button below....  After that you will see a little button on the bottom left, with a + and ""click to configure post options"" click the +.  Beside post options you will see HTML Off by default. Change this to HTML ON - auto line break.  then finish you're post by clicking reply as normal. You have now embedded video into your post. Hope this helps! <br>   <object width=""480"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value="""
