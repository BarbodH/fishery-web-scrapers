462522,mattybculp,2010-05-03 17:21:00,388,hey guys with most seasons still not open for another week to a month. the bug has come early with this nice weather. has anyone seen the carp? lol. I usually fish on the otonabee or trent severn for em but with water levels and such just havent been spotting them. just wondering if anyone has seen them spawning yet. Thanks
