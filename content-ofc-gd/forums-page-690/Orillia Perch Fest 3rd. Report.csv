About every 20 caught 1 keeper. Sunday was better. We saw 1 tag Perch caught beside us by a little girl with her family. You could have heard the excitement across the lake. They pulled anchor and they were gone to the headquarters. Came back an hour latter and anchored. $500.00 tag we could hear the kids say. As of yesterday 15 tags caught. Here's a few pictures.
