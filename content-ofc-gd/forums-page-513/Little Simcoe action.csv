602849,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-15 00:42:00,4399,Finally managed to get out to Simcoe with my son last Saturday and man it was hot that combined with the bluebird skies and shadfly hatch I knew it was going to be a tough bite and it was we managed to land 5 fish for the day. It sure is frustrating watch countless 5 and 6 pound smallies follow your bait to the boat and flip ya the bird. Anyways it was fun being out on Lady Simcoe!

602879,irishfield,2011-07-15 01:11:00,26272,LOL Brian.. there's a 250 HP Triton on our lake with a FULL top that isn't much higher than the top of the Opti-max. I'll grab a picture (of the goofy looking) thing some day.
