I herd the guy who was killed was standing on shore, when a drunk boater ran ashore, and hit him?  Hey spinnerbaitking, this guy was from your home town... One of the McGlynn clan.."
602637,OutdoorDan,2011-07-14 15:47:00,325,"It's not very clear if he hit someone on shore or if the victims were in the boat?  Not surprising that alcohol was involved, especially at 3 in the morning."

Sounds callous, but alcohol was involved and therefore this was all about bad choices effecting others. Feel really bad for the victims..."

Word is at least one of them worked at a local marina.  Another accident that could have easily been avoided.    Ian"
