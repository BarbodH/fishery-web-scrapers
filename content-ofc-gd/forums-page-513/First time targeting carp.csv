601773,bobowski,2011-07-11 23:13:00,360,I had the day off today so I decided to head down to a local creek where I spotted a lot of Carp a few weeks back when I was looking for a spot to fish Bass. I have only caught one Carp in my life before today. I caught it by accident while targeting Pike on Georgian Bay using sucker minnows. To tell you the truth I have never been interested in going after Carp before. I thought that it would be slow and boring. After today I can tell you that is not the case at all. I picked up a can of corn and I was on my way. I started by chumming the water with a few fist full's of corn. The only rod that I have at my house right now is a light-medium action rod loaded with 6 pound line so I knew it was going to be interesting but figured that if my drag was set right I good get the fish in because of where I was fishing. There was no way the fish could go up or down the creek because of the shallow water on either sides of the big pool I was fishing. As soon as I cast out my corn covered hook I was getting lots of quick small bites but I was unable to set the hook so I switched up to a smaller hook. That seemed to be the answer. I hooked into my first fish and the fight was on. It wasn't huge but it put up a good fight pulling drag. When it came time to landing the fish I knew that it was going to be a problem. I didn't have a net and there was no good spot to pull him out. I got him to the bank and thought that he was done but a quick head shake snapped the light in an instant. Off he went. Oh well. I told myself that next time I would make sure the fish was absolutely out of energy when I attempt to land him. I continued to fish and hooked into another fish about 30 minutes later. This fish was bigger and I took my time and was eventually able to land it.  My first non accidental Carp!    As the afternoon went on I caught 3 more Carp. None of them had much size. This one is pretty much a replica of the other two.    I ended up having a great day and enjoyed catching a new species. I will definitely be doing it again. I would like to try using a hair rig.

602006,Beans,2011-07-12 15:32:00,3339,"Great report !!!...Congrats on catching your first carp on purpose...  A hair rig should up your hooking percentage...a straightened out jig makes a decent baiting needle...just make sure your bait (corn, boilie,) hangs just below your hook...too long a ""hair"" will make for missed fish..."
602204,bobowski,2011-07-13 03:50:00,360,Thanks for the advice. What's size hook should I be using?
602372,Victor,2011-07-13 21:00:00,1609,"Congrats on your first successful carp outing! It's always nice to see another angler converted! You always hear the stories how they're garbage fish and ""why would you want to catch those ugly things""."
602384,Beans,2011-07-13 21:29:00,3339, Right now I'm using the no. 4 wide gap carp hooks I received for free with my rod order from New World Carp last year...  I usually use a no. 6...some use even smaller...
602387,mike rousseau,2011-07-13 21:40:00,4661,  For fish that small... Size 8 or smaller... I would use a 10... It's not like they ate gunna straiten the hook...  This also makes your baited hook lighter and less suspicious for the carp
602509,Weeds,2011-07-14 09:46:00,782,Circle hooks work great too.
602517,bobowski,2011-07-14 10:59:00,360,"Once again, thanks a lot for your expert advice. I am planning to hopefully get out again in the next few days. I will let you know how I did."
