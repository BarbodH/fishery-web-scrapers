602499,ld17,2011-07-14 03:28:00,319,I know if you upload your pics to photobucket you can edit the pics there and it will give you the effects your looking for.

602514,umKthxbye,2011-07-14 10:48:00,247,I use iRetoutch. It's got the exact blur tool that you are looking for. Takes a little while to blur but it works good.
