602480,The Urban Fisherman,2011-07-14 02:44:00,2050,"I wanted to get the kids out one evening this week and finally managed to swing it tonight... We didn't get out of the driveway until 7... At which time most 2.5 to 4.5 year olds are probably getting into their P.J.'s.  lol I figure you can't trade in good memories with the kids just to make sure they stick to their bed time!  Anyways, we were out from 7:15 or so until about 9:15..... Just as the fish really started to eat Mommy called and gave us a hard time about getting home! lol. I'll let the pics tell the rest...  Before hitting the water we checked out the Area where we'll be hosting the Fish-a-Thon!       Then we hit the water and Averie got into the gills before I even got my rod rigged...     After some panfish action the kids decided they wanted to go for a quick dip...         After the swim it was time to get comfy and enjoy a snack and bedtime movie while dad caught a few fish        Like I said just started to get some bites as the moon came up over the horizon but it was time to call it a night      Goodnight!  Ryan, Averie and Luke"
602481,irishfield,2011-07-14 02:48:00,26272,AHHHH.. so you were pre-fishing!!! Where's the pen...
602485,ChrisK,2011-07-14 02:52:00,2772,Leave a couple in there for us to catch Ryan. Must be nice to be so close to a great spot like that.Looking forward to chucking a couple of baits around out there.
602486,mike rousseau,2011-07-14 02:52:00,4661,Portable DVD player... Good idea...
602557,The Urban Fisherman,2011-07-14 13:02:00,2050," haha Actually I'd like to see if I can put some patterns together to help out our Fish-A-Thoner's - I've always excluded myself from winning any of the prizes so pre-fishing is pretty pointless for me!  Just get the braggin' rights!   No worries Chris! Not last night anyways! haha The kids swam more than we fished.... ticket was a craw on a flippin jig off of trees last night though.... this morning it was topwater baits until I left shortly after 7 a.m.    It's actually my iPad which is an upgrade from the portable DVD player we used to use..... The DVD player was great to, but it's nice not having to worry about batteries or DVD's... I love it because once the kids are done fishing and swimming and such... I just pop on a movie and I get to actually fish for a while! lol"
