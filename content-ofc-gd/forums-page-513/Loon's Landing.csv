602560,johnnyb,2011-07-14 13:14:00,3413,"I've parked there to use it as a launch point for a canoe trip.  Nice people, relatively clean camp...pretty basic accomodations, but didn't look bad at all.  Easy access to some decent fishing....just look for rapids, weedbeds and islands...many of which you can find between Dry Pine Bay and the bottom of Five Mile Rapids"

603002,johnnyb,2011-07-15 12:45:00,3413,Then it should fit the bill nicely....not too far off the highway either.  Oh...I recall the launch ramp being kind of steep....but lots of great scenery and fishing.  Good luck...let us know how you do!
603004,cynmar,2011-07-15 12:51:00,169,"We stayed there once, not too bad , cabins clean however central showers which was a surprise for us . If I remember right, it is right across the river from Meshaw Falls cottages. If you go across the river you'll see the falls coming down. Most people go in close to the mouth of the creek because the falls gives quite an outflow. However, there is a weedline that stretches out into the river, I 'd say almost halfway across. I sat there around 8""00 pm one night and caught almost 10 pike and my personal best 42"" pike on an ultrlight rod with 15 lb. test line. What a battle. They were using leeches for the pickerel back then, this is over ten years ago.  bill"
