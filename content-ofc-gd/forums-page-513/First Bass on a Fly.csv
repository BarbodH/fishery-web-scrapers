602192,shadowfly,2011-07-13 03:11:00,84,"hey guys after 11 hours of work decided to hit some creeks i know of, thinking i had all my fishing gear in the car , i soon realized i had forgot my spinning Rod at home, all what i had with me was my 4wt fly rod and my fishing tackle.goingthrough the pack i found one of my fly boxes. tried few nymph patterns and nothing, put on a purple wooly bugger  and this little fellow hit it.My First bass on a fly very impressive fight for it's size , snapped a quick picture (sorry about the quality)and let him go , got into 2 more bass but lost them  had to call it the day. sure looking forward to tying some more flies and hitting the water again. Tight lines Shadowfly "
602193,GBW,2011-07-13 03:15:00,8460,"that is my goal this year or next, fly fishing for bass and walleye.  when I catch a walleye next time out I'm going to the fly gear (provided I'm in a boat)."
602194,BillM,2011-07-13 03:17:00,17367,Sweet!!!  Smallies on the fly would be a riot.
602198,fish_fishburn,2011-07-13 03:32:00,1311,Thats so cool.
602206,registerfly,2011-07-13 03:59:00,198,smallies on a fly are loads of fun. Got into a couple back on 24 long weekend up at Waterfalls Lodge.
602213,ChrisK,2011-07-13 10:25:00,2772,Nice fish. I bet he gave you a run for your money on the 4wt. I've been chasing smallies around with my fly rod now for a couple years.Its addictive to say the least. Just got to make the transition from my float rod now and I'll be a full time fly guy on the river.
602224,nuke,2011-07-13 11:57:00,60,Nice.  What size of leader did you have to go up to? 3X?  Very nice fish indeed. Mike
602322,johnnyb,2011-07-13 19:12:00,3413,Very nice....I fish river smallies with a 7-8 weight and even the little guys give a great account of themselves....would be a real battle on the 4w for sure!
