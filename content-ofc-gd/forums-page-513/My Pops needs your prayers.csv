602839,Joey,2011-07-15 00:16:00,9122,"Sorry to hear Nancy, my thoughts are with you.  My father had stage 4 lung cancer and it if helps at all, he looked like that at one point, but pulled out of it and lived another few years before he died of a heart attack (due to complications from the lung cancer).  Hopefully he will pull through this and can continue his treatment.  There is always hope!!"

602518,Tarzan's Jane,2011-07-14 10:59:00,1183,"Hi everyone,  I would like to hold my Pops up and into your thoughts.  He is so ill with stage 3 lung cancer.  He finished 33 radiation treatments the end of June.  Had two more chemotherapy sessions left this month but the doctor cancelled them.  I had taken two weeks off work to help with the driving to his radiation treatments, I thought it was working.  I went to  visit him last weekend and oh my God I can't get out of my mind what I saw on his back.  Brutal, just brutal.  He has a burn from the radiation the size of a dinner roll plate I'm guessing 8"" in diameter.  His skin is purple and red and peeling.  I don't want to think that he isn't going to make it - but I need to get ready.  I don't think he weighs 90 lbs....they are to start him on oxygen.  His eyes are different....it's like life is leaving him.  I was told last night that he will be going into care August 2, 2011.  I am hopeful that he will come back home.  He is only 68 years young.  Please say a prayer for Gary.  Thanks Nancy"

602565,irishfield,2011-07-14 13:28:00,26272,"A tough road for sure Nancy, known all to well to me. I hope your father has better success than mine did.  I've seen them stop chemo on a few patients here before the protocol was supposed to be done, in the last 8 months we've been at Sinai, and it was because their body couldn't handle it anymore. On 2 out of 3 of them the chemo had stopped any progression and or shrunk the tumors. I'm hoping your Pops is part of the same 66% !"
