Monday's video is inspired by limeyangler - as a result of watching his videos I can't get the phrase ""supper fish"" out of my head!

602954,Nipfisher,2011-07-15 03:52:00,2449,That's some good fishing. Nice video work as well.
602963,rufus,2011-07-15 04:05:00,267,Thanks guys! I am just getting the hang of the camera but for something that fits in the shirt pocket it seems to be pretty good.

603023,rufus,2011-07-15 14:00:00,267,Even my spinning reels have the handles on the right hand side. I am pretty much ambidextrous but I never could get comfortable reeling with my left hand. I started reeling with my right as a kid with my first reel - a Shakespeare baitcaster bought with money earned delivering newspapers!
