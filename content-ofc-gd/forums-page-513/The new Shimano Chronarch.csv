602306,kickingfrog,2011-07-13 18:41:00,8333,I know it was discussed before (the search seems to be in hiccup mode as well) but I don't remember if it was confirmed.  Dave posted this on fb today:    I like my shimanos but I never had a chroarch.
602315,EC1,2011-07-13 19:00:00,930,http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Shimano_Chronarch_50E_Series_Casting_Reels/descpage-SCH5E.html  Here's the details. I honestly don't know why they made it look almost exactly the same as the new Citica. Daiwa seems to be the buzz this ICast.
602356,PainInTheBass,2011-07-13 20:14:00,102,"If the talk on TackleTour is right, then the 'new' Citicas and Curados are now on the Caenan's frame, and the Chronarch is built ont he Curado 200e frame (and 50e).  All they have done is shuffle things around and rebadge, and call it a day."
602365,Dan668,2011-07-13 20:47:00,1120," Yup all rebadged, pretty disappointing ICAST for shimano IMO."
602375,danbouck,2011-07-13 21:07:00,4380,Can't expect them to re-engineer everything every year
602378,Dan668,2011-07-13 21:11:00,1120," Nope you cannot, but here they ruined the chronarch line as it is now the same as the Curado E series painted white. Pretty pointless move to me. They could of kept the reels the same and added new gear ratios or colours or anything really. Now they are lacking in the $200-300 spectrum of the market, and downgraded all their reels."
602407,fish_fishburn,2011-07-13 22:22:00,1311,"Thanks alot Kickingfrog, now I want one. It's been close to 10 yrs since I bought my Chronarch and it is sooooooooooo nice. Spooky nice."
602412,muskymike,2011-07-13 22:43:00,772,I have a Mg on one of my Avids and would only say good things. The reel was worth EVERY dollar.
602419,Dan668,2011-07-13 23:03:00,1120," I have a chronarch d, awesome reel. But what I'm trying to point out is this new chronarch is just a rebadged curado, nothing else. Its not a true chronarch. I was actually waiting for them to release it but when I found this out, ill pass. I have too many reels anyways so I guess this helps me out in a way"
602422,danbouck,2011-07-13 23:07:00,4380, or the chronarch is just in the old curado frame
602491,shadowfly,2011-07-14 02:59:00,84,im debating if i should keep this one or sell it now that chronarch line has gone down 
602493,BillM,2011-07-14 03:07:00,17367,White??  Ugly.
602494,Duckie,2011-07-14 03:07:00,305, nothing is more disappointing than the awful cheap EVA foam grips on the new Sustain.  its the same awful handle that most people hate with a passion on the stradic CI4s..  myself included. I will never buy a reel with that kind of handle. feels terrible.  and now they put it on a 250 dollar reel to save costs  
602496,kickingfrog,2011-07-14 03:17:00,8333,"I don't like the foam either. It may save them $, but I think they do it to save weight as well."
602497,Dan668,2011-07-14 03:20:00,1120," Keep it, a real chronarch! Not a fan of the grips on the reels also."
602503,ah_long,2011-07-14 03:47:00,354,"I was at cast today and the chronarch was dissapointing, but I guess the move was necessary for shimano to realign their product offerings  Those who bought the chronarch d and curado e got an amazing deal"
602507,highdrifter,2011-07-14 06:09:00,2534, Bill its what's on the inside that counts..
602589,F_ast,2011-07-14 14:07:00,154,Does Shimano still make the CORE?
602749,PainInTheBass,2011-07-14 20:23:00,102,"  I don't think that the Chronarch and Curado platforms shared internals.  As a result, I doubt that the new Chronarch is a Chronarch in Curado clothing.  On the upside, the new Chronarch is only $199 USD.  On the downside, you are paying an additional $20 USD for for a white painted Curado e, which were being blown out for in the low $100's recently."
602751,PainInTheBass,2011-07-14 20:24:00,102,  Yup.  The new Chronarc is a very good reel - about as good as the Curado e series.  It isn't the same Chronarch that everyone loves.
