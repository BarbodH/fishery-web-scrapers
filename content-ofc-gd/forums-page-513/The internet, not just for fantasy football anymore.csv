Been reading awesome stuff much fun and wisdom here  I live in Colorado(boo Co. walleye) and been coming up since I was 9.  We have been fishing in Wabakimi 40 years.

602576,adolson,2011-07-14 13:45:00,783,Welcome.  Maybe the internet should also be for fantasy fishing??
602609,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-14 14:45:00,336,"  Thanks Dana, My family does have a league called the WFL (Wabakimi Foolball League) and we use our fishing monikers.  Me, I'm the Pikeslayer.  My sons are Armada and Walligator.  As spread out as my family is the league is a fun way for us to communicate in a different way"
