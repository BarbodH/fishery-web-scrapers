Went home when the bugs got bad, but wasn't satisfied. I hadn't caught a fish in a while, and I needed to get one today. So, the wife went off to bed and I went off to fish at Sharp Lake at midnight. I did try Clear Lake first, but the only thing I ever caught there was smaller than the lure. Four casts into Sharp, I get one on the hook, reel it up almost to shore, and the damn thing gets off. I clearly need to sharpen or replace the hooks that came with this Hula-Popper, because I am trying to set that hook hard. It felt kinda small anyhow.  So, that one got away, and I cast in again, and I get another one on right away. That one I landed! It fought harder than the other one for sure.    He's not a monster, but he is my fifth bass this year (and ever), and my first landed fish at night, with a my new, yet trusty, Hula-Popper. That lure is worth every cent for me.  I've not really fished at night before, only once last week and only had one strike.  Anyhow, I'm not getting huge fish off the shore up here, but usually good eatin' sizes. Some day I hope to catch something wall-worthy, but I'm just happy to get anything, really. Time to go clean it."

603039,adolson,2011-07-15 14:27:00,783," Thanks.  The moon was nice. I want to go out tonight too, but the wife works late and she's got the car. And then she wants to watch videos when she gets home. :\ might be another 12am trip."
