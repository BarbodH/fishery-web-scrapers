Rigging can get downright sketchy.  see this; http://en.wikipedia....etch_(geography)  then look at this; http://www.sailflow....Forecast+Graphs  Easterlies have been blowing since early yesterday and forecast to continue through tomorrow pm. The wind speed can be misleading. It is the distance the waves travel (i.e. the full length/width of Lake Ontario from the east) that can result in rough seas. I'm not sure if Simcoe is succeptibe to fetch waves/winds??  Here's a link to a Grimsby (west end of LO) web cam; http://www.arservices.ca/webcam2.html Does anyone know of any others???  I'm not trying to scare/keep anyone off the water, but if you are travelling a good distance to get to the lake, or have a smaller boat, you may want to do a little homework before heading out.  Any lake condition updates from fellow members would be greatly appreciated over the weekend. I have guests scheduled for Sunday am and will be keeping an eye on Sailflow.  Be safe out there,  Slayer"

If you are planning on going out and coming from a distance, my guess is you might plan a more easterly launch point Oshawa/ Whitby if convenient, fishing may be better."
603166,Fang,2011-07-15 20:50:00,1330,The steelheader book mark the river flow web sites  Anyone fishing the great lakes like Erie and Ontario should add sailflow to their favorites. Never go out without checking it.
603188,dave524,2011-07-15 21:33:00,4508,"Here's one I came across very recently, interesting that it forecasts winds up to a week in advance, not going to vouch for it's accuracy, haven't really followed to verify if it is correct, but maybe worthwhile to keep on hand, you have to backtrack a bit to find your locale.  http://www.windfinder.com/forecast/grimsby"
603270,Musky or Specks,2011-07-16 02:17:00,2710,I'll laugh if its big waves my buddies racing the 300 this weekend he'll be chucking up his cookies the whole way.
