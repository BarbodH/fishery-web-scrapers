602535,Handlebarz,2011-07-14 12:14:00,3790,So the family and I went out to Saskatchewan two weeks ago for a trip we had a blast on the way out I was looking at different reels to but for musky fishing. We were going to hit Kenora and Figure 8 Baits for me to get my new reel but plans changed and we came back through the USA again. I stop off in Fargo ND at Gander Mountain so I can get my NEW Abu 7000 I take a look at it at the store and think everything is fine. Well last night we get home I take it out of the box put it on my new 9' rod and get ready to spool it with me 100 lbs PP and this is when I notice that the handle is BENT WTH. I was not happy and with looking at the box and the reel there is no way it happened during shipping I wonder if it was on the floor and got bent there or what either way I am pissed for one reason I bought a broken reel two I did not notice it at the store my bad.  I know Abu will be good for it or Gander will replace it but it just means I now have to head back states side to exchange it or I am hopping that Abu will jsut send a handle to my door.  I was sp pissed at 10 pm last night I decided to not go fishing today well this morning maybe later.  Sorry for the rant but thanks for listening and next time you buy a reel play with the drag and see if it will pass the reel handle if not then dont but it ask for another.

For mine, I set it on the work bench and lightly tapped it with a hammer until it was straight and never had another problem with it."

603051,mike rousseau,2011-07-15 15:00:00,4661, Try gander... I bought a flasher there and when I got home... No charger... So mad... Call them up and calmly explain what happened... They shipped me a new charger and $30 gift card as an apoligy... I was blown away with the customer service.... No questions asked!!!!
603133,Handlebarz,2011-07-15 19:49:00,3790,Dang Bill I need your $$$ At $150 its costly enough to expect to not have to do repairs before using it. I was looking at some other reels but I love the feel of my other 7000 BG so I had to take another to bad they dont make the same model.  Mike I was just going to take it in but maybe I will call them or send a email that sounds like a good idea.
603137,mike rousseau,2011-07-15 19:58:00,4661,Call... The guy actualy remembered helping me with my purchase
