603111,lunkerbasshunter,2011-07-15 18:25:00,2585,that is one heck of a walleye!  Big sheephead as well  Cheers!
603115,TDunn,2011-07-15 18:39:00,680," Nice eye!! Solid fish!   My buddy had Italo out on Lake George this past weekend. Although they caught walleye, they ended up keeping a sheepshead for dinner. Italo cut the meat into finger like strips and had the hotel cook the fish up for them.  My buddy said it was awesome and will be keeping another one in the future....  TDunn"
603208,splashhopper,2011-07-15 22:32:00,2931,sounds like a fun day
603209,Hooked,2011-07-15 22:34:00,891,"My dad, and others I've heard, keep sheepies for chowder.  Apparently they are perfect for it."
