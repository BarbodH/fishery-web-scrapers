602748,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-14 20:21:00,2690," LOL, something tells me Bill won't be running out to get any!! I'm going to use the new baitcast set up with it this weekend for a longer period of time...curious to see if I have the same problems.  I'm filled up with 30#, 832."
602767,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-14 20:57:00,4399,"I have not really had any issues with it other than dye/fading, no fraying,no breaking. I may pick up a couple more spools."
602794,richyb,2011-07-14 22:07:00,774,I got the 30lb and like it alot on my casting rod. Had a little bit of a green thumb at the end of the day but I had to wash the fish slime off anyways.
602926,bucktail,2011-07-15 02:25:00,1857,Great line but getting green hands does suck!!
602993,johnnyb,2011-07-15 12:25:00,3413,"I didn't notice the price of suffix...what's it on for?  $14 I'm guessing?  I DID pick up a 4-pack of 10' ratchet straps though...only $10, marked down from $33.   Perfect timing as mine are getting skeered.  I mean....frayed."
602997,Roy,2011-07-15 12:37:00,13728,I rarely buy a product fresh off the drawing board. I've found that the best measure (for me) of product quality is the length of time elapsed from product launch until it hits the bargain bins.
603032,FrankTheRabbit,2011-07-15 14:10:00,479,"They have a Rapala Xrap baitcast & rod combo for $60, normally $100. Anyone had much experience with that product line? I own the R-Type spinning reel and it's quite a smooth casting reel. The halo thing is definitely in effect."
