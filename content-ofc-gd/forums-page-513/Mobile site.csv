601866,mike rousseau,2011-07-12 01:47:00,4661,You mean the red and blue ones that have a white dot if there is a new post... Right?
601867,umKthxbye,2011-07-12 01:47:00,247,Why would one device all of a sudden not have them and another does? 
601873,Grimace,2011-07-12 01:52:00,2020,I don't have them either.  iPhone.

602252,mike rousseau,2011-07-13 14:55:00,4661,now with the new domaim there are no red and blue dots... but if there is an unread topic... its slightly shaded blue... the circles were a lot better...imo
602257,Grimace,2011-07-13 15:19:00,2020,I agree with Musky Mike.  Hopefully it is just an option they can turn on.
602273,umKthxbye,2011-07-13 17:19:00,247,Yeah I've noticed the hardly visible blue aswell. Hopefully we see the dots come back.
