602791,misfish,2011-07-14 21:52:00,29133,"Thanks all for your input here. Were going to pass on Santa.and take them straight up to pops and mudders and play kiddie games and swim in the pool, wet a line for some fishies with them. I hear theres a no fire ban in areas,hope not up there. I want to enjoy dogs and mellows on a stick over an open fire with them. It,s     tradition."
598977,misfish,2011-07-03 19:12:00,29133,"Here my problem with this. In two weeks were taking the grankids up to the cottage(well mudder and pops,it,s a cottage to us.LOL) and were going to stop into santas village. It,s going to cost just over 100 bucks to get in ++++. Thats unreal IMO. Whats so great about this place? Is santa going broke or something? Maybe he runs a gas sled now. Crazy entrance fee if you ask me.   For those that have been,please tell me my money wont be ill spent."
598985,Terry,2011-07-03 19:44:00,14456,welcome to the 21 first century  yeah that's a lot of money  but wait a few years and see how small your wallet gets when they want you to take them paintballing
598987,BillM,2011-07-03 19:49:00,17367,"Brian, here are some coupons to help you out.  http://www.attractionsontario.ca/index.cfm?DSP=Chapter&ID=11&ACT=Coupon-Info&Coupon_ID=53&Member_ID=1138"
598989,misfish,2011-07-03 20:07:00,29133,"Thanks Bill. Just printed it off.  Terry ,I hear ya. Looking forward to it though.Wonder if the young lad would like golf?  How much will a box of worms cost 10 years from now?"
598994,bushart,2011-07-03 20:19:00,2628,I heard santa been losin a bit at the casino lately so had to up the fees
598997,Terry,2011-07-03 20:35:00,14456,well you would be mean and charge a lot too      if you only came once a year    I'm just saying
598998,fishing n autograph,2011-07-03 20:37:00,2540,"Could be worse, I paid $300 for me, my wife and my 3 yo daughter at the time to get into disneyworld for one day"
599003,Harrison,2011-07-03 20:53:00,2202,I heard the reindeer unionized.
599006,misfish,2011-07-03 20:58:00,29133, Well a 30-06 should solve that problem
599011,Governator,2011-07-03 21:19:00,879,"We took my my son last summer, but he was only 1 at the time and I don't think we had to pay for his admission, just our own which seemed backwards.  It's definitely a good time for the younger kids (Like I'd say under 6) but if they're older they probably won't have as much fun.  I think Centreville offers a lot more bang for the same buck if you're in the Toronto area."
599012,vinnimon,2011-07-03 21:22:00,2593,"  Bring your boat B, and make a left at santas Village Then tell the gang your santa with a boat Worked for me 2 years back And they had a blast on the lake"
599016,mercman,2011-07-03 21:45:00,7054,I went and its great. I saw Santa and his wee liitle elves and Rudolph Dont know how much it cost though. Mom and Dad never discussed money matters in front of us kids  Just GO!! The kids will remember it for days. You will remember for years  Paul
599025,Rob,2011-07-03 22:48:00,467,Just to get you in the spirit Brian here ya go  Rob C

599031,Muskieman,2011-07-03 23:03:00,2472,if the kids are over 8 years old..not worth the 100.00$ take them to the Muskoka Wildlife centre instead......... just my opinion.   Randy 
599041,Terry,2011-07-03 23:23:00,14456, LOL
599057,Rizzo,2011-07-04 00:39:00,4754,"Funny you'd post this Brian, we were considering it recently. We had plans to bring our 4 boys there this summer rather than Centreville where we've gone in the past. When we saw the pricing we decided we'd do Centreville again! They have some good family deals so for us parking/ferry/ride passes were still cheaper than Santa's Village...but I will have a look at the coupons Bill posted and maybe reconsider"
599058,Rizzo,2011-07-04 00:45:00,4754,"...so just had a look at the coupon. Family of 4 you'll be just over $100 to get in. The cost of entertainment I guess. It could be worse though Brian, you could have 4 kids to pay for like I do! Looks like I'll be approx 150.00 even with the coupon"
599082,vance,2011-07-04 01:39:00,719,"I was there 27 years ago with the wife and kid and it nearly broke me then,just goes to show you things haven't changed.Forget the scenic pontoon boat cruise,it doesn't go anywhere.  vance"
599169,Familyfisherman,2011-07-04 10:00:00,188,"We've been 5 times.  It is a complete waste of money if the kids are older than 5 -- between 2-5 it's ok, but expensive.  The sports area has some go carts that are fun, but they cost even more money...I have 4 kids that are now 10, 8, 5 and 3, and we took our last trip there last year, just isn't worth it now that we have Wonderland passes."
599170,Roy,2011-07-04 10:04:00,13728,But does Santa really spend his summers there? Are they hiring elves or dwarves these days?
599175,bigugli,2011-07-04 10:28:00,6138,Santa's village is for the pretend Santa. Everyone knows his true summer home is in Rovaniemi on the Artic circle  Where else do you think he learnt to ride and tame reindeer?  Right Dr Sal?
599309,esoxansteel,2011-07-04 20:45:00,1307,  Look on the bright side sat least they did not want you to take them to a leafs game
599491,pikehunter,2011-07-05 08:30:00,1659,"Yep, lots of bucks to go somewhere you really don't want to go to in the first place...take them fishing instead, if they get bored toss them into the lake, if they can swim that is. Cannot get over the admission fees to any park these days. And then as an added slap in the puss most charge your car a fee to enter too! And your car never even asked to go in the first place!"
599527,bigbuck,2011-07-05 12:36:00,2449,"For younger kids,8 and under, it's a great spot. All the rides don't have a height restriction on them and the kids will have fun so in that sense, it is worth it."
