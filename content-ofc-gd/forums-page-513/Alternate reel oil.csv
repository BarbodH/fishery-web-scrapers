602643,Garry2Rs,2011-07-14 16:21:00,1425,I have been using Automatic Transmission fluid for a couple of years now. It's very light and seems to work okay. Best of all I always have it in the garage.

602647,Roy,2011-07-14 16:45:00,13728,"I agree with the sewing machine oil however, how much reel oil do you need that would make it that expensive? You're never supposed to put too much oil in a reel, ever. Or is it just for the convenience of sewing machine oil being more readily available?"
602649,mike rousseau,2011-07-14 16:50:00,4661,Convenience... I don't know anywhere to get reel oil in my city...  And I always seem to misplace those little oil sticks

602781,aplumma,2011-07-14 21:16:00,6896,When I was really going for distance surf casting we used lighter fluid but it was only good for a few hours but the casts you got would be fantastic. Now I use synthetic Transmission fluid or dot5 brake fluid both do not attract water but dot 3&4 are a no no they will cause damage and rust to occur.  Art
