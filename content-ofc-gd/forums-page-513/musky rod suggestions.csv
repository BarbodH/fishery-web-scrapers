601672,K_F,2011-07-11 20:39:00,107,"so in the bonehead move of the year (so far) i broke one of my musky rods on a snag (rope tied to cinder block). it started to move and i figured it was a piece of wood.  Brilliant i know, anyways i need to replace the rod,  im looking for the following criteria  -2 piece -troll or cast -not ridiciously expensive  i fish the kawarthas and ive got a abu c3 6501 to go on this rod.  the rod i broke was a rapala magnum i picked up for $60 and i really didnt have a problem with it.  im just looking  for some suggestions - 2pc seem to be not all that popular from what i have seen.  any help would be greatly appreciated  thanks  kf"

601689,Gregoire,2011-07-11 20:59:00,1397,I have a 2 piece rapala magnum rod that i no longer use. Messega me if you are interested in buying it. If you want to upgrade the compre is available in a 7ft 2 pc rod. I have one and I like it a lot.

601707,jay27fish,2011-07-11 21:19:00,37,i just got a bass pro rod its a 2pc musky series that comes with a counter wieght it was only 130 i also have a 2pc compre and a st croix legend series and they are all good but the bass pro give you best bang for your buck at a reasonable price
601710,lew,2011-07-11 21:21:00,12766," I'm agreeing with Bill, the Compre's are excellent rods !!"
601749,Nipfisher,2011-07-11 22:41:00,2449,I just picked up 2 Shimano TDR 9' trolling rods at Canadian Tire. They were $60 each. They are 2 piece medium action with a fast tip. They are not a true musky rod but more of a utility rod. I figure they will do me to start. I have them paired with a Penn 320 GTi and a Diawa Great Lakes reel. If you are only spending $60 on a rod you'll get what you pay for.
601793,peter23,2011-07-11 23:34:00,95,i would go with a shimano compre like stated above
602636,robp,2011-07-14 15:46:00,11,"Daiwa Heartland is a good inexpensive musky rod. LeBaron's sell the 2pc 6'6"" for $59.72"
602642,jedimaster,2011-07-14 16:14:00,3472,"I have a Heartland and a Shimano TC4 inshore Teramar and both are good rods, although the shimano is my fav of the two."
603006,F_ast,2011-07-15 12:57:00,154,"For the price, the Compre is a great rod.  I use Loomis and St.Croix rods now, but my old compres have held up to hundreds of fish.  Another great rod that is not very expensive (any more) are the Fenwick HMG AV rods.  Not sure if they are still being made, but they can be found as old inventory items.  I think when I first got one, the rods were between $160 and $200.  Think I saw a bunch at JBs fishing depot for like $80 in the fall."
603011,K_F,2011-07-15 13:20:00,107,Thanks for all the replies guys - i appreciate it
603029,goteeboy,2011-07-15 14:06:00,175,"Search ""tackle industries"" or ""reaction strike"" on ebay. I bought the one with a telescopic handle and I like it.  I bought from seller name: iamhoo"
