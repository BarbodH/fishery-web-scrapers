He wanted to use his retirement money wisely, so it would last, and decided to buy a home and a few acres in Portugal. The modest farmhouse had been vacant for 15yrs.; the owner and wife both had died, and there were no heirs.   The house was sold to pay taxes.  There had been several lookers, but there was a large barn that had steel doors, and they had been welded shut. Nobody wanted to go to the extra expense to see what was in the barn, and it wasn't complimentary to the property anyway......so, nobody made an offer on the place.   The NY guy bought it at just over half of the property's worth, moved in, and set about to tear in to the barn.......curiosity was killing him. So, he and his wife bought a generator, and a couple of grinders.......and cut thru the welds.   What was in the barn...............? Go to: www.intuh.net/barnfinds/afa70.htm Go to; www.intuh.net/barnfinds/afa70.htm   and start wishing it was you who had bought the place. Click on the index  Oh yeah Click on the index for some more tidbits on this article. Thanks Bly for pointing that out."
138763,lunkerbasshunter,2007-12-02 15:34:00,2585,wow that is incedible.  i would question why you wouldnt open the barn up though.  A barn that big made out of block is not a normal storage barn  Cheers!
138780,fatherof3,2007-12-02 16:11:00,1769,"that is crazy,quite the bonus to his purchase."

138818,Clampet,2007-12-02 18:21:00,1947,Never seen so many old classics!  Kinda reminds me a granny. Shame to have all that bird poop all over 'em though. Looks like 20 + years worth of dust has settled.
138837,fishindevil,2007-12-02 19:00:00,6254,"WOW...I wonder how many are worth big bucks,  there might even be a few ONE OF A KIND.  ...cars in there ,man what a find,thanks for sharing"
138854,pikehunter,2007-12-02 20:26:00,1659,"That is a treasure of a find.  The weird part of the whole story is that you would think that there would be some local yokels, oldtimers that would remember that the owner had all those cars and would have passed the word onto anyone that inquired about what was locked away in the barn."
138863,irishfield,2007-12-02 20:54:00,26272,Read Bly's link Harry...takes the Bull out of the email story.

139364,fishinfool,2007-12-04 12:13:00,366,  The biggest problem would be which car to start working on first and how do you get it out. LOL
