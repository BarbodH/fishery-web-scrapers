139033,ccmtcanada,2007-12-03 14:06:00,7971,Dont blame you for not going!!!  As for the minnows....fish crisp snack?
139034,BFSC Kevin,2007-12-03 14:13:00,1351,how about go during the middle of the week? looking pretty good
139036,Headhunter,2007-12-03 14:17:00,5703,"If properly dressed, it can actually be alot of fun out there and one thing's for sure, there wouldn't be alot of boats out there either! I'm heading down on Thursday, weather be damned! HH"
139038,Beans,2007-12-03 14:41:00,3339,Salt 'em...use for icefishing...the head or a bit of tail works well for crappie at Uncle Jack's Lake...  Who dat masked man in da middle...???  
139040,cranks bait,2007-12-03 14:44:00,721,"Yep it was cold, but still nice.  I went to go out yesterday in the St. Lawrence.  Made it a bit farther than you.  I actually got away from the dock, motor running, as I shovel snow off the boat.  Get out in the river, go to make a turn.  No turn.  Crap steering froze.  Luckily I wasn't very far from home.  Dropped a line anyways and used the bow troller to get back.  With what we had here, I can see how Picton would have been nasty.  It looked like a great day for fishing, but I guess the fish thought other wise.   Good call on only wasting minnows and nothing else.  How big is your freezer?  Could always keep them till you can walk on water."
139057,bucktail,2007-12-03 15:41:00,1857,Have a feeling most launches except for the ferry launch will be frozen for the year after this week. BE CAREFUL out there guys!!!!!
