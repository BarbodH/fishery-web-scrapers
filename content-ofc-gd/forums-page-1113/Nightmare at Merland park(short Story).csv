139548,davew3,2007-12-04 20:57:00,430,Your a good man for being able to laugh. It beats stressing yourself out. The fish gods owe you one. 
139567,superdad,2007-12-04 22:02:00,353,What happened to Global warming - OOP's missed 2007...................................  Looks like the fishing MIGHT be over - at least soft water fishing - don't dispare it's not the 15th of the month yet and the fishing gets better closer to Xmas.

139583,addict,2007-12-04 22:35:00,475,"typical fishing ""issues"" as me and bass kicker call em.on a trip to cochrane we lost a boat seat.got a flat tire on the car.bent the hell out of the camper tongue some 100k from town on a sunday evening it was practicaly dragging.drove back to town doing 30k.was lucky enough to find a machine shop were a guy reinforced and welded the tongue.when he welded the tongue it fried the wiring to rat poo.but at this point we ran it anyway.fixed the wiring a day or two later got chewed by skeeters.at the end of the trip coming home the trailer tongue broke in a new place bad this time sparking as we drove down the road.had to call basskickers ol man to come get us as we had to much gear for the car.he came in the middle of the night from courtice to martin river outside northbay he wasnt all that happy lol.we left the camper on the side of the highway for good.all in all it was an awsome trip with tons of scenery and amazing fishing.so good in fact we try to go every year last year was the best fishing and only minor ""issues""."
139501,Big Swede,2007-12-04 18:51:00,23,"WORST... FISHING TRIP... EVER  Let me put it to you this way Cookslav... if my fishing trips with you start to more often than not resemble this fiasco, I'm taking up golf. It would be a far less frustrating experience. Did I mention that I suck at golf? You know it.  Big thanks to the folks at Merland's for giving us another trip full of great hospitality. Loved the new Suzuki motor too! But I'm pretty sure I requested no wind or frigid temps. I'll have to check my confirmation letter just to be sure.  For those all of you headed up towards the BOQ in the next few days/weeks, the freeze is coming sooner than later from what we saw. The harbour was mostly covered up when we were leaving and a few still nights and frigid lows will lock down Picton Bay too.  As for helping out fellow anglers, cookslav and I were paying it forward when Pete Bowman and his Fishing Canada buddy saved our bacon last year when our rental called it a day as we were out at Thompson's. We'd be halfway across the Atlantic by now if they hadn't taken the time to help us out.  But that's how it works out there folks. We are all in it together and taking some time out from fishing could very well save someone's life. Besides, it's only a couple minutes but you are making a huge difference in how things could unfold out there. And it always comes around, for good or for bad, right?  Later OFC'ers! I'll be laying low, licking my wounds from a dismal 2007 campaign. But I'll be right back out there soon enough. And once my little Swede gets old enough, then you won't hear the end of my chatter!  Happy holidays everyone!"
