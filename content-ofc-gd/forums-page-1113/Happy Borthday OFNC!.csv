We've seen lots of changes, lots of surprises and lots of fun. November 15th of last year we flung open the doors and let in the first wave. Since then we've had .. 136,000 posts. 2,400 members 144,000,000 hits 9,800,000 page views 1,555,000 visitors (over 1,000,000 first time visitors) 3.6 Tb of bandwidth Our database has over 200Gb of information  Our sever up time is well over 99.999%, we've never been hacked and we've somehow not managed to go bankrupt.  But the most important thing of all... We managed to make new friends, help out people we've never met and create a unique and inviting culture for everyone to enjoy. When the original group of admins decided to do all this I think we couldn't have imagined it working out so well. Thanks to all of you guys. The number of hours we spend keeping things going is well worth it when we see allthe good it does for everyone and I am quite proud to be a member."
