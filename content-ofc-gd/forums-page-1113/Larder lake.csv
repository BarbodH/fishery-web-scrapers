139164,fishnsled,2007-12-03 20:02:00,3520,I wish I could help you out but it's been about 3 years since I was up there.  Some beautiful country up that way and some good fishing to be had on Larder Lake.  Have a safe trip.

139171,aniceguy,2007-12-03 20:41:00,1094,"solo paddler has a cottage on a lake not far from there, he might not be there but might have a clue.  Rouyn Noranda and Kirkland lake are pretty close to Larder Lake so if you were to check weather up in either it might give you a really good idea"
139271,FinS,2007-12-04 00:10:00,463,Naughty u better pack some woolies they are getting pounded hard by the snow maybe even bring a shovel just in case lol  temps are -15 -20 if u plan on doing any ice fishing scratch larder lake off your books it is considered a fish sanctuary until feb 14 2008 but then again i may be wrong talk to the folks at the larder lake gas station they might help u out for some good fishing in the area have fun and drive safe ps i will be going up there in 2 weeks cant wait i can already here the fish calling my name lol
