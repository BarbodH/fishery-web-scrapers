139354,medmart,2007-12-04 11:26:00,587,Good day every one this year i plan on doing some ice fishing from perch to eyes and mabye lakers what line do you recommend i should use there seems to be a lot out there and i don't have a clue  thanks  Rob
139371,Blake,2007-12-04 13:11:00,418,Personal preference would be Fireline Ice Line in 2-6lb and then also the Trilene Ice line for a mono in 3lb.
139375,wallyboss,2007-12-04 13:21:00,1095,"I tried P-Line Fluoroice 4lbs on the weekend ,  I didn't like it saturday as it kept coming off the spool but I wasn't in my trap. I tried it again yesterday in the Trap and it was pretty good."
139394,BFSC Kevin,2007-12-04 14:36:00,1351,"bps has the fireline ice on sale for $3 something, reg at 6 something. 50 yard spool."
139399,Raf,2007-12-04 14:49:00,3495,"dont get braid for ice fishn unless you are a hut dweller. the stuff absorbs water, freezes and makes a mess.  this is one application where i feel mono is still king."
139402,misfish,2007-12-04 15:12:00,29133,Guess ya didnt like my answer eh.LOL
139446,misfish,2007-12-04 16:42:00,29133,I like the Ande line in 8 pound.Inside or out of a hut.
139457,Sinker,2007-12-04 17:10:00,8692,"For most situations, I use 8lb mono as well. Walleye, whities, lakers.....all 8lb xt with a fluoro leader.  For panfish, I usually have 4lb P-line fluoro ice. Sometimes I run a 2lb leader off that if its needed.  I've tried the braid, and I find its a PITA. If does freeze on the spool, and if you want to get your line back down in a hurry......it really pisses you off after a while....lol. Good and sensitive, just frustrating for me.  Sinker"
139463,outdoorguy61,2007-12-04 17:17:00,220,"I began using Spiderwire Fusion two winters ago and really liked it on the Bay of Quinte. Better hooksets with no stretch for the depths and current, seemed to function well under cold conditions. Just another two cents.  outdoorguy61"
139473,fishersquige,2007-12-04 17:42:00,52,Fireline crystal boys and gals.  Crystal is super sensitive and yes I was skeptical at first thinking it would be like the other conventional braids but it does not absorb water.  Obviously all lines will freeze up in the cold but with crystal its minimal.
139601,addict,2007-12-04 23:01:00,475,8lb mono works well for my reels.not sure what its called but its like black rope i use this on the thermal tip up and attach 10lb floro lead to it.much easier to hand line than mono.
139671,medmart,2007-12-05 01:07:00,587,Thanks for the input guys much appreciated  thanks  rob
