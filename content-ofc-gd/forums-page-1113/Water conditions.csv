Its been almost two months sinse i've been out fishing, so i'm really looking forward to getting into some rainbows!!!  I've got my digital camera up and running, so hopefully i'll be able to catch some fish and make up a report.  Thanks.  Tight lines.  lovetofish"

138859,lovetofish,2007-12-02 20:41:00,500,"Thanks guys, made the trip dispite the bad weather/water conditions.  We fished through white outs and a brisk wind, but managed to land on male around six pounds.  The one bite i did have, quickly snapped my leader, must have had a knick in my line.  There was a total of nine fisherman within sight of us.  They managed to land a total of 9 or 10.  But as everyone was saying the water was like mud!!!   Thanks for the information.   lovetofish"
138993,blizzcat,2007-12-03 07:14:00,92,do you think the bad conditions will last through the weekend?!! I'm supposed to be on Steve's charter on saturday  I hope the water clears up.. but I guess a delay is better then not catching anything. *crosses fingers for the weather to get better*
138996,niagara jeep,2007-12-03 10:04:00,20,Just was outside and the wind is strong from the west at the moment.  Not sure what the rest of the week will bring .  If the winds die down just stick above the power plants for the clearer water....
