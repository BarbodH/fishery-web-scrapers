Anyways, I found this article that sheds light on polluted waters from the trash....  Cigarette Butts Found on Bottom in 100 Feet of Water!  This past summer, staff from the LSFAU  conducted a bottom trawling study.  As well as the usual fish staff encountered, they also hauled up a variety of garbage in various stages of decay.  One such item that seemed to remain in its original condition, even when buried in silt in over 100 feet of water, was cigarette butts. On the day when the author of this newsletter was out trawling he witnessed first hand how staff of the Fish Unit would pick on their one fellow staff member who smoked (and who did ""many moons ago"" throw his cigarette butts overboard).  Every time a butt was hauled from the depths, this poor guy would receive a tirade of abuse from his peers.  Although he will remain nameless for fear of further condemnation, he respectfully asks all his smoking brethren to refrain from disposing of their butts in the lakeâ€¦ he is simply tired of accepting the blame for every single cigarette butt at the bottom of Lake Simcoe!
