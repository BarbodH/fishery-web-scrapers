139523,joonmoon,2007-12-04 20:00:00,528,Him and the Gecko have a side deal goin on right now that involves shipments from South America. Once the mob finds out there will be a hit out on them both. Maybe a witness protection program is needed here. Pokey...? Last I heard he was down from Brokeback Mountain and in a rehab center along with Lindsay Lohan and Britney. Could he be reformed back to a heterosexual...? Wait and see.
139528,Hookset,2007-12-04 20:08:00,367,"I hope that little green glob of clay is gone for good.  He stole my - Super Slider Snow Skates - Popeil Pocket Fisherman - ""Bay City Rollers"" Album - Afro - Leather (fake) Platform Shoes with Side Zipper - Rubik's cube (with one matching side, was as far as I could get) - Furry Snow Boots.  If I see the Little *%#@ he's going in the microwave.    Hookset."

139572,snag,2007-12-04 22:14:00,1932,"I guess my ""gumby on the beach"" pics were a little racey and got deleted.  Take it from me though,  He's doin' alright!"
139578,danc,2007-12-04 22:26:00,4677," And just what is wrong with the Bay City Rollers??? LOL I actually saw them in an outdoor concert last August. But they weren't the reason that I went. The concert also included Orleans, Tommy Tutone and Edgar Winter. I really wanted to see Mr. Winter. But I must admit that the BC Rollers were entertaining.  "
139629,Hookset,2007-12-04 23:36:00,367,  That picture is just too damn funny. The guitarist in red has gotta be wearing a rug on his head. It just doesn't look right. He shoulda just sucked it up like their mad dog drummer did.   Hookset.
