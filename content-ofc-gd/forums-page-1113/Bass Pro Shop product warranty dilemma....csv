139002,kentooley,2007-12-03 11:50:00,208,"I once broke a berkley cherrywood series rod bought from walmart....no receipt, no proper id....was told by the cashier there was nothing they could do....I asked for the manager and raised a stink and walked out with a new rod.  Chris"
139054,Blake,2007-12-03 15:07:00,418,There is a way they should be able to track in the purchases file in their CPU.  These records are not deleted and it will take them alot of time to find but they should be able to find it if you give an approxiamate time of purchase.
139084,misfish,2007-12-03 16:48:00,29133,"Take it to Walmart.they exchange anything,  Me thinks you are SOL aswell. Sorry."
139092,charlesn,2007-12-03 17:13:00,551,Is it a lifetime warranty or is it time-limited?  I think you may be screwed if it is time-limited.  Maybe contact Browning direct and see what their warranty procedures are.  Charles
139173,urbanangler1990,2007-12-03 20:41:00,933,thnx guys for ur input  BTW what is a SOL?  i feel offended

139189,douG,2007-12-03 21:00:00,2693,"There was no intent to offend UrbanAngler, but I think your chances of success are slim to none, but it really all boils down to the amount of time you wish to spend on this."
139190,misfish,2007-12-03 21:03:00,29133," Thanks buddy. No offending was meant,more like I couldnt type the right words."
139191,irishfield,2007-12-03 21:11:00,26272,"  Guess he didn't grow up in the ""era"" of asking your dad what the chances of getting the keys to the car were.... and his only comment was SOL son .. SOL."

139197,urbanangler1990,2007-12-03 21:27:00,933,"got it thnx ontariocarper    irishfeild, nah i didnt grow up in the era where dads beat their kids and punishment, im taking off my belt now haha"
139201,irishfield,2007-12-03 21:53:00,26272, We didn't need to be beat...we just needed the knowledge that the principal had the school board issued leather strap (or his private Beaver Tail) in his desk drawer and that our parents would do one better when we got home. That was enough to keep us in line and we all turned out fine. Unfortunately the countries gone to hell since...  Good luck getting a new browning !
139203,misfish,2007-12-03 21:56:00,29133," Maybe that explains todays ignorant young,ns. Not all but,it was a good thing. Made me think twice,well maybe three times.Slow learner.   Beat is so harsh a word."
139259,lew,2007-12-03 23:46:00,12767," Norman Ingram Public School....... Don Mills........ 1954   3 whacks on each hand.....And  DID IT EVER HURT, jeeeeeez, I can still feel it   And the worst part was..... I was innocent........honest"
139264,irishfield,2007-12-03 23:57:00,26272,Sure ya was Lew...sure ya wuz ! Just like I didn't throw them snowballs at the grade 3 windows back in the day.
139289,Rustic-Fisher,2007-12-04 01:25:00,826,"Take it Back!!! You have a one year warrenty. I would not worry too much about the bill.  cheers Rustic-Fisher, And I work at BPS in the fishing."
139300,Burtess,2007-12-04 02:43:00,901," I agree.... I had the BPS breathable waders for about 13months and they wore out in the inseam area.  I took them in, no bill, and explained to them that I had bought them about (or slightly less) than a year before and they replaced them no problem.  Even got a bill with the replaced pair lol....  Burt"
139455,Canuck2fan,2007-12-04 16:56:00,1444," Exactly the Principal didn't scare me with the strap but knowing that I would get it worse at home sure kept me from tempting fate too much LOL. As my dad used to say, whatever that guy does to you it won't be nothing compared to what will happen to you here.... it was one heck a good bluff because it worked."
139611,addict,2007-12-04 23:13:00,475,take it to wal-mart they have the best return policy hands down.im all for wal-mart even if its american owned i hate ctc and am very reluctant to give them cash unless i have to they treat u like a criminal and will even give u a hard time with a reciept.bought an auger from can tire the blde came off the second time i used it less than a week old with reciept wouldnt even give me cap screws so i could fix it myself.bought a shimano convergence from ctc broke the tip and return it at wal-mart no reciept no questions asked on straight exchange
139623,urbanangler1990,2007-12-04 23:28:00,933,"hmm this walmart idea is intresting, but what if no WM or CTC carry, or carried a 10 6 browing? do u think theyll still take it?"
139635,steverowbotham,2007-12-04 23:51:00,1800,Browning is a BPS brand. WalMart and CTC wont carry it
139644,kentooley,2007-12-05 00:09:00,208,"The reason I brought Wal-Mart up was because once I asked for the manager I got results plus, the fact they are such a large organization didn't hurt either.  BPS is no small outfit and I think you'll get looked after.  Chris"
