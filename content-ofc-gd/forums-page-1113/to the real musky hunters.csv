139270,Grandman,2007-12-04 00:07:00,31,"the issue with the obrien fish was the scale it was weighed on.  I can't remember exact details but I'll give a shot (maybe TITAN can fill in the blanks) The scale that was used had a valid Canadian inspection sticker, but the IFGA requires yearly (?) inspections of scales (in the states??) The fish was weighed 65 # even.  65 POUNDS EVEN.  The IFGA tested the scale at 65 pounds and found it to be within 2 ounces of true weight.  Therefore the fish weighed between 64 pounds 15 ounces and 65 pounds 1 ounce.  BETWEEN 64 POUNDS-15 OUNCES AND 65 POUNDS-1 OUNCE.   Wow, what an uproar."
139293,Handlebarz,2007-12-04 01:43:00,3790,WOW and the season is not over yet
139294,Gerritt,2007-12-04 01:50:00,6129,  because of the reference our eyes see... the person in pic #1 is alot larger the the person in pic #2...  our brains are wired to perceive things in this manner (based upon available reference info..in this case this size difference of the angler..)  G
139298,titan,2007-12-04 02:27:00,6,"Grandman,  In addition to rumours surrounding the handling of the fish, there was an issue with the annual certification of the scale to CSA standards that was identified and reconciled. Regardless of what issues were associated with the catch, it is recognized as the Canadian record muskie.  Is the O'Brien fish bigger than the Cal Johnson fish? Is it bigger than the Louie the ""Lumberjack"" Spray fish? Should all the records be set aside in order to have the Williamson fish take its rightful place as the true record? You be the judge... that's the beauty of Winternet!!  Tight lines, y'all... TITAN (Mike Dalakis)"

However, Mr. O'Brien, Mr. Williamson nor any of the others post here to  admit to nor refute anything that is said. So, without any ""proof"" one way or the other, I think that the whole excercise is redundant. All this is is conjecture. Let's please take a break from this and get our facts straight before condeming a fisherman for having caught a very large fish that most of us would kill to have caught. I'll lock this now and if any of the mods think I'm out of line, unlock it......no hard feelings at all."
138944,titan,2007-12-03 01:16:00,6,"Everyone is entitled to an opinion... all we can go on is the accounts of witnesses, some of which are friends of mine, the weighing of the fish in the presence of the CO for the area, the certification of the scale and the fact that a noted muskie fishing historian verified the measurements and the weight. The fish is recognized as the Canadian record and may one day soon be recognized by other organizations if the application is ever processed by O'brien. I guess only time will tell.  Many of the pictures dont really do the fish justice. The image I think is most telling is the shot of O'Brien holding the fish across his body on the dock - not the close up but the one taken from a distance. As Shawn Mahar tells the story, as they pulled into the dock that day, the fish in O'Briens arms looked like something out of a cartoon!!  The other thing to consider is body / muscle and tissue mass and body mass including stomach contents. It has been reported that the O'Brien fish had something like 12 pounds of bullheads in its belly when it was caught. If you do the math, a 50 pound class fish very quickly becomes a 60 pound class fish when combining the two values.  Larry Ramsell has updated his Compendium and it is now availalbe. Several new additions have been included... including some significant not well known Canadian fish.  Tight lines, y'all... TITAN"
138980,titan,2007-12-03 04:42:00,6,Thought I would add these pics of the Williamson fish for comparison. Both fish are 60 pound class fish... and there are several similarities in terms of size and proportions. Food for thought....

138395,Marc Thorpe,2007-12-01 00:32:00,621,"Hi Grandman,I see I upset ya #1 pic is right at the dock #2#3 is after the clean up cause it did not look that way in the bottom of the boat Internal slippage that bad? One thing you might consider,Obrien is 68 inches, tall the muskie is 58 inches hanging,I suspect there's more than 10 in difference judging by the pic But I guess we will see down the road Witnesses? They all had witnesses,most will be diss-credited even with witnesses A great big fish is an enormous fish to most that never seen one and even those who think they know great big fish   (there really are not that many of em that can tell a great big fish ,Thats the one thing I can personaly tell ya) To me they all look the same Lets see Williamson 55x 31 = 61 ponds Obrien 56 x28 = 65 pounds ? (It was 58 in length hanging with the thoat slit) ???????  I have very good reason to question that fish,56x 28 laying and 58 x 28 hanging (with the head slit as it was slit in the boat),the belly change It was weighed a couple weeks later at 56 pounds,I am suspicious of a fish losing 9 pounds after a a couple of weeks.I have a couple die and a year later they weigh within 2-3 pounds of death some 12 months ago,frozen is frozen.They might loose a couple pounds within the first 24 but I suspect weight loss diminish to nile You realize Mammoths have been conserved in ICE for millions of years without change unless decomposition had commenced before thorough freezing   the fish GB is holding was 55 pounds  Would be nice,if you posted your name,I like being called names makes me happy and smile BTW thats the nicest thing anyone said to me all day,you made my day (I p...e you off) what a great day  Just as an info,Fish dont dry out they de-hydrate then decompose unless frozen. When they die,within 2 to 6 hours rigamortous may set in depending on the surrounding air temps,it may be longer in colder temps ,dehydration may cease if frozen  What do I know Right"

And last but not least, there are companies that will make a replica free of charge which, in my world at least, amounts to ALOT of money for a fish that size.  So would I be able to quit my day job? Probably not, unless the catching of said wr Musky coincided with a big lottery win. But would catching the wr Musky put money in your pocket? Yes.  And no way would I let BPS put a fish like that in its tank. I've seen the Musky in there. They won't get the wr Smallie after I get that one, either"
137544,Greencoachdog,2007-11-27 23:20:00,8163," What's up with that?    In order for any fish to be an IGFA record nowadays, it must be killed, gutted, and the stomach contents examined... to make sure it didn't die from lead poisoning.  I personally would only kill a fish I was going to eat or was required to kill by law. It would be far more fun to photo and measure it, then let the masses wonder if you let a record swim away alive.  I may even talk a little trash about it in certain circles!"

I guess my point is,65 pounds may not be the # to shoot for,maybe 62 pounds will do it Either way,the world record harvest is a personal decision,wheter released or not,it will certainly fuel the message boards (hahahahahahaha) Till then ,I""ll leave the chasing 60 pounders for others"

With the right lens and the right positioning an image can be ""distorted"". Just take a look at the one guys fingers in the horizontal musky shot.

137146,Squid,2007-11-26 17:41:00,1656,That is a tough question to answer. I guess it depends on the size of the fish and age. If it is a 65 inch fish and 70 lbs    then I would probably keep it so that everyone can see the size of the fish close up not just in a photograph.

I've always said I'd take a picture and release it. Even with my shiney new Sport licence this year... I think I'd still take that tact. Can't see killing her...for the Bull that goes along with it.

In Texas, they (BPS) pay something to $1000/mth for a live teenage bass specimen at the Bass Pro Shops in Grapevine.  At least that's what I heard.  It would be neat regardless to have your fish on display for people to hold in awe...  A carp you could probably put in a garbage bag with some wet sponges and it would survive the drive.  lol  Those are some tough critters.  A musky would be a lot harder to keep alive.  A bass would be relatively easy to keep alive I think, so it would be the most realistic.  I'd do the same with a 4 lb perch, sunnie or rockie too.  Charles"
