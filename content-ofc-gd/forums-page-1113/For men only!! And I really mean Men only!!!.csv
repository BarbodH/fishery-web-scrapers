Edge Designs is an all-women run company that designs interior office   space. They had a recent opportunity to do an office project in NYC,   and the client allowed the women of this company a free hand in all   design aspects. The client was a company also run by all women execs....   The result?........well.......We all know that men never talk .....   never look at each other....and never laugh much in the restroom.   The men's room is a serious and quiet place.   BUT now...with the addition of one mural on the wall...... well, let's   just say the men's restroom is a place of laughter and smiles...and   men totally unable to pee.                      "
139158,dsn,2007-12-03 19:53:00,1018,"Update:  This isn't from Edge Designs in NYC but, This photograph depicts a men's restroom at a Sofitel (a chain of 5-star hotels) in Queenstown, New Zealand, which has attracted a fair bit of interest and commotion: Five star hotels are normally famous for their opulence and their design but the new $45 million Sofitel in Queenstown is gaining notoriety for its little boys room.  It has brought the hotel a couple of complaints from church goers and a couple of hundred people wanting to take a look.  It's the most popular room in the five star hotel.  Hotel manager Mark Wilkinson says the toilets were just a way of putting a little levity into the posh hotel.  ""Certainly it wasn't our intention to offend anyone,"" he says. A news report on the Sofitel's unusual restroom decor can be viewed here."

139162,tapout,2007-12-03 19:57:00,166,"lol dsn  It is funny but not near as uncomfortable as the mens washroom in a popular nightclub in SYdney Australia, where instead of murals and urinals it was basically a ""trough"" you tickled in with a full mirror from wall to wall and ceiling to floor.  I opted for the stall and toilet.  LOL."
139174,SlowPoke,2007-12-03 20:41:00,2984,Those of us that do wash our hands after a good pee know what a sink is. Those that don't could probably still benefit from washing thier hands in the urinal! -Brian
139178,JohnF,2007-12-03 20:45:00,3494, But those just look too nice to pee in. They look more like something you might find in a milking parlour or a brewery.  JF
