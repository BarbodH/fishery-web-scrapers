138568,jeffw,2007-12-01 19:59:00,267,I'm heading out tommorrow if anyone is interested?? I posted on the hookups board but I don't think that anyone goes there anymore. Cheers Jeff
138572,Clampet,2007-12-01 20:13:00,1947,"   And, the North end of Nipissing is froze also, I heard. The Cache Bay is froze."
138577,irishfield,2007-12-01 20:36:00,26272,I can apparently get to my island on Temagami....if I strap long boards to my feet !  Year round neighbour is getting to his by sliding a canoe beside him for safety.
138586,Clampet,2007-12-01 21:08:00,1947,What a life!
138588,irishfield,2007-12-01 21:17:00,26272,"I couldn't handle the pre safe ice and post safe ice periods Paul, it would drive me nuts. This guy using the canoe for safety lives there all year long. As matter of fact..the guy I bought off lived there with his wife and small kid year round for about 4 years."
138619,ravinerat,2007-12-01 23:11:00,64,"The ""little"" Lakes in the Barrie area are freezing over as well as some of the creeks. This was today. 4"" of blue ice. Don't know what further out brough. I was only 20 ' from shore checking. I hear Couch has turned.  RR  "
138647,Seaweed,2007-12-02 00:51:00,135,Read a couple of reports of three inches of good ice around Petrie Island a nice ice fishing spot up east of Ottawa on the river.  Some guys were even out fishing on it.... I think I will give it another week or so before I venture out.
138655,Carp,2007-12-02 01:33:00,1488,"I love ice fishing just as much as anybody, but walking on 3 inches isn't my thing. What happens when 3 inches turns into 2 inches or thinner as you're walking ??? I'll wait for 6 inches + before venturing out anywhere. If I drown, my wife will kill me !!!  Don't be in a hurry. Be sure. Be safe. Be alive for the next report."
138672,fishindevil,2007-12-02 02:11:00,6254,"I heard that they are ice-fishing in some of the open all year lakes in the haliburton area for splake and rainbows,one report said that there was 4-5 inches of hard blue ice, !!!!   so it wont be long now till they will be snowmobiling on it....as long as we dont get a week long warm spell the ice should be there to stay now,till spring....its been about 9 years since all the lakes froze this early they say !!!!...so the ice fishermen are just loving this weather big time....cheers"
138694,Bernie,2007-12-02 04:10:00,3190,I drilled a test hole in Nipissing today...took a video. Check it out.   
138707,daisy_girl58,2007-12-02 06:16:00,116,Well Gentlemen  We drove by Cooks Bay this Saturday afternoon and it was frozen quite aways out......So why don't we have a guessing contest for each area???? My Hubby and I will say DECEMBER 21st! Ice huts will be out! Woohoo!! I am excited!  Lorissa    ting! getting ice fishing gear ready!
138710,Terry,2007-12-02 11:29:00,14456,I could not believe how much ice was on simcoe out from beaverton...lots if the wind stays down it will be making lots of ice
138738,lunkerbasshunter,2007-12-02 13:50:00,2585,in southern ontario rain is on the way and warmer temps.  That ice will be gone for sure.  CHeers!

138742,Muskieman,2007-12-02 14:10:00,2472,  Not a chance that I'll be goin' out today... can barely see across the street... Blizzard conditions.. Bummer..
138758,Rich,2007-12-02 15:07:00,3927,"They say it's going to be the coldest winter in a decade. Be patient, the ice will stick around this time."
139281,tapout,2007-12-04 00:55:00,166,I was wondering if anyone has checked the ice thickness in south bay of nipissing? I know I can't go until the new year.  Just curious thats all.
139284,Bernie,2007-12-04 01:06:00,3190,  Haven't as of yet. It was looking real good until last night/today. A foot of snow on top of a couple inches of ice isn't real good for ice making. A blanket of snow insulates and brings up the damn slush. I was hoping to get out there next weekend for some R&R at the cottage. Don't think it will happen for at least 3 weeks now.
139320,daisy_girl58,2007-12-04 04:15:00,116,My husband went to the canal in Keswick today and told me it looks about 2 inches thick but then went to end of glenwood and maybe 1 1/2 inches thick.....
139328,nautifish,2007-12-04 05:04:00,1416, I heard 15 yrs but i guess 10 is close enough....lol
136504,jeffw,2007-11-24 02:05:00,267,Time to start the ice watch thread. I will be out checking to see where there is ice tommorrow and will report back. Drove by the canals in the wick and there iced over already but doesn't look like more than a skim. Cheers jeff
136511,brifishrgy,2007-11-24 02:22:00,559,goin to be a while yet for ice .. got a trip to Quinte in a few weeks so lets wait till the new year before we start talkin ice checks
136520,FinS,2007-11-24 02:49:00,463,its too early to be reporting ice reports check back with us in 2-3 weeks
136550,Sinker,2007-11-24 03:57:00,8692,"Too early? I think I'll be drilling next weekend in the haliburton area with no problems. Check the long range forcast!!  Heres what the kawartha's look like this morning!     Wont' be long now!! As long as it stays below zero at night, we'll be drilling in no time!!  Sinker"
136553,irishfield,2007-11-24 04:05:00,26272,6 degrees Sunday.. 8 on Monday.
136565,ilario11,2007-11-24 04:34:00,41,"I agree - toooooo early. UNLESS you're talking small back lakes for splake and such.. up in the Haliburtons, Algonquin region I've heard the small lakes are already ice-covered... But most of us don't fish those waters! Simcoe's 2 months off! If it stays cold!!!  Anyhow, It's -20C in Bancroft as I write this...That's cold enough to form a good coat by morning, even on a fair sized lake  I'd like to get my boat out one more time too, so I'm hoping for a warm up myself"
136603,Iamcanadian,2007-11-24 11:44:00,14,"Head Lake in Haliburton is frozen over, will be checking smaller back lakes over the weekend"

136641,jeffw,2007-11-24 15:13:00,267,I'm hopin to hit the back lakes for splake next weekend. A buddy of checked one of the lakes I fish this morning and said there is just over a inch of ice. Cheers Jeff
136668,Bernie,2007-11-24 17:25:00,3190,South Bay of Nipissing is frozen over. If the long range holds true or close to it ice should be thick enough to get out to my cottage on a sled by Dec 8th.
136677,ilario11,2007-11-24 17:57:00,41,"  check again...latest forcast has changed...cold temps for long range...  i think those who are eagerly awaiting the ice season may get their wish  there's 3"" of ice on many algoiquin lakes according to my sources... -22 last night up there... ice might be here to stay!  hey, it's almost dec"
136708,irishfield,2007-11-24 20:29:00,26272,Ummm sorry...it's changed to + 5C for Sunday 6C for Monday and RAIN! 3 Tuesday 4 Thursday and RAIN.

136738,lunkerbasshunter,2007-11-24 21:53:00,2585,Im up in north bay some small back lakes are frozen over but unstable.  THere is about 10cm of snow from last night and another 10 coming.  But rain and warmer temps will melt all the snow and ice in the next couple days.  I think you are looking at late dec before you get any real safe ice.  Hopefully it will be sooner then last year though.  I talked to a guy in the south bay of nip who didnt get his huts out until feb last year.  Be safe on the ice if you do try to go out this early.  Cheers!
136851,Sinker,2007-11-25 04:33:00,8692,"  Not sure where your getting this weather??  With the exception of monday, I get below zero temps all next week when I check TWN. 6 degrees with rain in the day, then -5 over night will only make more ice.......it freezes much faster than it thaws!!  Looks like prime ice making weather to me......for the Haliburtons at least.  Sinker"
137240,jeffw,2007-11-27 00:17:00,267,Just looked at haliburtons forecast and it looks like I might be able to get onto some of the smaller splake lakes next sunday. Take a look at the forecast.Haliburtons forecast Cheers Jeff

138518,jeffw,2007-12-01 15:24:00,267,Last night sturgeon lake was wide open and this morning theres ice covering most of the lake. By the way at 10:30 am its -14. Cheers Jeff
138520,Sinker,2007-12-01 15:41:00,8692,"  No kidding.  I went by the launch at pleasant point yesterday evening to see if it was still open. It was. headed up there this morning with the boat in tow to try and get one more duck hunt in, and it was a no go. The ice has built up a lot over night, and that's with a stiff wind blowing. Amazing how fast it happens when conditions are right!!  I'm getting the gear out today, and going for a road trip in the morning. MMMMM.......splake  Sinker"
