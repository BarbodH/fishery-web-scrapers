The first, an Ontario surgeon says, ""I like to see accountants on my Operating table, because when you open them up, everything inside is Numbered.""  The second, a Quebec surgeon  responds, ""Yeah, but you should try electricians! Everything  inside them is color coded.""  The third a B.C. surgeon  says, ""No, I really think librarians are the best; everything  inside them is in alphabetical order.""  The fourth, an   Alberta surgeon chimes in: ""You know, I like auto mechanics...those guys always understand when you have a few parts left over.  But the fifth, a Newfoundland surgeon shut them all up when he observed:” You’re all wrong. Politicians are the easiest to operate on. There's no guts, no heart, no balls, no brains and no spine, and the head and the ass are interchangeable   What you guys think?  lol  Tony"
