138969,ExtremeArmyTeam,2007-12-03 03:00:00,18,"Hey Brian:  The weekend before Mark and I went and you pulled in you should have jumped in the boat! I know you had stuff to do but boy what a day with Team X-member Mark Kulik.  28 fish and only 3 fish were under the 4lbs weight. We were long linning the Carolina Rig with the Slammer man they were on fire. Even when the bite seemed to slow down we would move and they would start to slam the slammer.We had a great day on the water, ti was cold but from talking to Mark and Karl they had a cold one the other day!  To bad the season had to end but what a way to finish off the season. Carolina rigs are a great tool to use!!!  Going to the Extreme Only on Extreme Angler TV  Spike"
138979,David Chong,2007-12-03 04:36:00,836,"Mark, It wasn't cold at all, oh sorry that was afterwards at that waterfront restaurant! Some warm grub sure takes that chill off!  At least you got some nice pictures!  It would appear as though we'll be ice-fishing in no time. Cheers, Dave (Another crazy one who was out there, we only caught 6 fish) Here's Alvin holding one of them! "
139000,andrey7474,2007-12-03 11:37:00,47,hi guys  what's slammer?  thanks
139003,mart,2007-12-03 11:58:00,93,Brian that's a chilly report. So do you have your order in for a new boat now???? Would of liked to have been there but the boats was tucked away for the winter. What was the big fish for the event?
139066,misfish,2007-12-03 16:18:00,29133," You just had to rub that one in eh Spike. When I got home and told the wife about the invite I declined,she says to me,WHY DIDNT YOU GO. 25+ years and I still cant figure her out.LOL  Marcel no boat order here. I can always go down to Marks and hook up to his while he,s at work.LOL J/K Mark.  Slammers are the baits that Mark makes. Stike Zone. PM him.He,ll be more them happy to share."
139091,Mark Kulik,2007-12-03 17:12:00,348,"What restaurant Dave? oh yeah now I remember! LOL, that was a fun but cold day, I guess we'll have to wait fir the ice now-just not the same though! Next season Brian, I have to get you and Patrick G out!, so many fish so little time! at these crazy temps should'nt be long before we have ice.  Mark"
138285,misfish,2007-11-30 19:39:00,29133,"Curl up by the fire with me as I thaw out my toes and fingers.Boy was it a cold one.Well it really wasnt that cold,it was the ride with the legend. I accepted an offer to fish today as it was the last day for Simcoe Smallie fishing.I will be the first toadmit,bass fishing in the warmer months is sooooooooooo,much nicer.LOL  Anyhoo,I arrive on time,but my partner for the day was not. I thinking ,oh no,snowed in as he was coming down from the north.I go ramp to ramp just to make sure I didnt miss him or get our info crossed. Im just about to head back to work when I see him coming around the corner.Yes,the legend has arrived.  Get to the ramp and I was kinda in awe. Man what a thrill this is going to be. I get out of the truck, walk over and shake my partners hand,with a greeting that was even a surprise to him. We acually knew each other from way back.I use to build homes for this guy. With all the hows things and nice to see you again,it was time to lget on the water with the legend on the cold Simcoe waters.  Along with us was a few other well known anglers like David Chong,Mark Kulick,Ward Edmonds to name a few.There were a couple of fish caught during the morning,but it was really slow.We mangaed no fish for our efforts,not even a perch.Drop shotting Strike zone baits and yum tubes didnt seem to be the trick today. Ohwell,I got to ride with a friend and a Legend.70 mph in -7 temps,thats what I call EXTREAM FISHING.  Here is the legend,what a ride.          My partner,Fred Patterson.LOL    Extream weather coming in.    Extream Team mobile      A short vid as my hand froze in just a few sec.  http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v731/mis...ishing07018.flv  This boat is fast folks.Hole shot was unbelievable.Up and down gone 70 mph in no time. I have a bit of frost bite on the face to prove it.  Thanks for the ride Fred."
138292,fishnsled,2007-11-30 19:58:00,3520,Beats being at work......I think.  lol!  Now what would the wind chill be at those temps and speed you were traveling at?  Here's a tip for the next time your in those cold conditions ripping up the lake......snowmobile helmet.    Thanks for the report!
138293,misfish,2007-11-30 20:00:00,29133,"Felt like - 40,and what fun would it be to have a helmet."
138296,Terry,2007-11-30 20:06:00,14456,very cool oh I mean cold going that fast this time of year I am sure you had a great time out with them
138297,medmart,2007-11-30 20:08:00,587,that looks like fun to bad you guys didn't hook in to any fish  rob
138298,fishnsled,2007-11-30 20:11:00,3520," It would be no fun at all!    lol!  A buddy of mine has been telling me to use the helmet in those conditions for years.  After bringing them along and leaving them in the storage compartment a few times, I decided to just leave them at home."
138302,Guest gbfisher,2007-11-30 20:22:00,0,Looks like a lot of fun and all but..  ..wheres da pics of dem green carps?  
138303,Tarzan's Jane,2007-11-30 20:24:00,1183,I guess you have to be addicted to fishing to go cruising at that speed in those temps....extreme for sure.
138305,misfish,2007-11-30 20:27:00,29133," Andy buddy,they are still out there,if you hurry,you still a few hours to get one."
138306,misfish,2007-11-30 20:30:00,29133," It wasnt so much the addiction,but the chance to fish from this boat and see what it was like.It got an A+.  Ok,it had something to do with the addiction."
138315,Guest gbfisher,2007-11-30 20:43:00,0, I guess I could go Pike and Perch  fishing and get one.............  
138327,OhioFisherman,2007-11-30 22:02:00,6623,"LOL Brian, 70MPH? not exactly a good day for it! I bet boat traffic was down!"
138329,tbayboy,2007-11-30 22:04:00,1497,My ears are getting frostbite just thinking about.  Sweet ride though.
138338,ravinerat,2007-11-30 22:26:00,64,Cool one Misfish. Ok now lets bring on the hard water.  RR
138353,Mark Kulik,2007-11-30 22:55:00,348,"Hey Brian , saw you guy's rippin around out there, made me cold just looking at it!, my Tr. hits 70mph, but no way I'm doing it now! too cold !-you guys were moving like your hair was on fire!, Bob Devine from Extreme Angler , drove up from Wndsor to join me for 1 last kick at the frozen can, we boated 8 good smallies, and lost at least that many, Wed. was much colder and we boated 30, drop-shot doesn't work as well when the temps drop , the smallies are belly""s to the bottom , all our fish came on the Carolina rig with, Slammers, I'll post a season recap, a bit later-time to thaw!"
138357,TJQ,2007-11-30 22:59:00,7806,"Brian... we need to get you some help... can anyone say ""intervention""??"
138363,misfish,2007-11-30 23:05:00,29133,"There is no help Boss,Im gone past gone as they say. Mark I was drag,n the tube and marking,but oh well,atleast I got out there.A first for me going this late. Look forward to your post."
138364,Mark Kulik,2007-11-30 23:05:00,348,"I' would offer help TJ. but I was out there too, 3rd time this week!, I would only make him worse!"
138367,Mark Kulik,2007-11-30 23:07:00,348,"I'll get into it a bit more in the post Brian, but the key was SLOW!, I mean stupid slow!, hard to do in 30-40 K winds, they were biting really light , if they felt you , they dropit."
