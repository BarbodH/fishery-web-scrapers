139214,lunkerbasshunter,2007-12-03 22:23:00,2585,those are some great fish!
139490,ccmtcanada,2007-12-04 18:31:00,7971," Hmmm....still not sold on ice fishing, but I may have to take it up b/c I'm sure I'll go stir crazy waiting until spring."
139544,lovetofish,2007-12-04 20:40:00,500,Wow! those are some nice eyes you got there.... any one of them a trophy in my books!
139600,walleyejigger,2007-12-04 23:00:00,876,"very nice, something to be proud of"
139604,addict,2007-12-04 23:04:00,475,those are some brutes nice work.
139740,kennyman,2007-12-05 04:13:00,737,WOW!! Awesome fish. I wish my wife wanted to go fishing all the time .................... or not LOL  .
139811,Mike the Pike,2007-12-05 13:43:00,3421,Good for you guys on your season.Lets just say after the BOQ Cliff and Carole you inspired me to do some shore fishing here in Montreal and also try for some nice eyes.Problem was it got cold to quick and all my spots were iced up.  Thanks for sharing the pics.
138898,ccmtcanada,2007-12-02 23:25:00,7971,"We were hoping that the weather would cooperate and that we could get out another time or two since our part one report...hoping for some more success, but the weather really has NOT cooperated this year.  The cold temps, the water conditions/clarity/level, and the wind all combined to make our prime shore spots unfishable.  We do have a system...depending on those factors as to what shore spot we pick, but it seemed that they all just sucked...LOL.  The storm we just got walloped with seals the deal....unless we get a large turnaround in weather, it's now to the tribs in search of Steelhead.  (assuming they are not frozen!!!)  Here's a picture summary of our other catches for this fall.....  First off...an accidental pike, caught by me.  Ended up being my PB pike...measuring in at 36.5"" and weighing one ounce shy of 11 pounds.    My 31"" long, 17"" girth and 10lb 14oz fishy.   Bly's 30 inch, 11lb 9 ouncer   My PB in length...and it's my final entry for the OFC Tourney is this 33.5"", 12lb 6 ouncer.   Bly was fishing alone one night at a new spot and surprise surprise she caught a nice one!  Measured in at 31 inches and weighed 12.5 pounds.  No pic unfortunately...as I had the camera at home...LOL.  My heaviest of the year came in at 12lbs 12 ounces, and measured 33 inches.   And in true Bly fashion, she once again gets the biggest fish of the year....this nice one measured in at 32.5 inches and weighed 12 pounds 14 ounces....beat me by 2 lousy ounces....LOL.   So...all in all, we had a pretty good year fishing for these guys from shore.  We probably only got out half the number of times as we did last year.  Last years weather was perfect right up through December.  We really are looking forward to next spring with our boat....and being able to catch some fish up in the Kawarthas....is it just me or does anyone else think it's gonna be a REALLY LONG WINTER???????????  Thanks for reading!"

Your strategies and methods are very effective, you can almost publish a book now with all of your impressive experiences.  Bly has conquered you once again ... remember what I said long ago about the the lure alterations and suspicious scenting ... <nudge>."
