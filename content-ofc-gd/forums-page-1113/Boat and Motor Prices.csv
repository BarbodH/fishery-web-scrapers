138703,fishinggeek,2007-12-02 05:17:00,325,"I might get a an aluminum boat and 4-stroke outboard.  I really want a double windshield model.  Which makes of boat and motor are the cheapest in price?  I'm more than willing to not buy a package, and get the boat and motor separately if that option is less expensive."
138705,danc,2007-12-02 05:21:00,4677,"A package deal is usually your best price. Also, beware that you get what you pay for."
138711,Terry,2007-12-02 11:31:00,14456,legend are the cheapest    and the lest expensive  .. there aren't  too bad but they under power the boat to make the price better
138737,lunkerbasshunter,2007-12-02 13:45:00,2585,i like the legend boats.  the packages they sell have smaller hp motors so you may want to upgrade.  Cheers!
138744,lookinforwalleye,2007-12-02 14:19:00,4399,"I would suggest you go to the spring fishing and boat show should be lots of packages on display so you can compare bang for buck.  Legend is famous for the low sticker price and for that low sticker you get a skinny boat with a 50 HP 2 stroke. If your looking at something decent from Legend and properly powered the price jumps into the 23-24k range and when you get into that price range other doors open up.  Last year I picked up a 16'-7"" Alumacraft with a 90"" beam full windshield,Galvanized trailer, 90 HP Yamaha 4 stroke for 18,500 but keep in mind the motor was 1 year old."
138748,glen,2007-12-02 14:26:00,2641,Buy used.
138809,silveradosheriff,2007-12-02 17:59:00,1025,Looks like some good deals have been coming up from the US as well....
138855,pikehunter,2007-12-02 20:30:00,1659,"Nissan outboards are reasonably priced made by Tohatsu (sp?) and some of the smaller ones, the 6hp and 8hp 4 strokes are Mercury."
138896,Sinker,2007-12-02 23:14:00,8692,"  Yup, what he said.....^"
138918,icefisherman,2007-12-03 00:08:00,952,"Yes, buy used from the US and save BIG! Well worth the effort...You could easily save 40% - 50% of the price of same boat package in Canada.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
138970,deepdiver,2007-12-03 03:35:00,2,"forget the Legend... Cheap sticker price but by the time you add up all the things that make a boat the price is not cheaper than a good boat like a princecraft or something similar.  The sticker price on the boat I was going to buy didn't even come with power trim (of course it didn't say that). Who the F@#$ sells a 90 HP merc without power trim? Also the advertised free upgrade to 4 stroke was all sold out etc... Just a bunch of crap and lies. Would never consider buying a Legend ever! Thats like buying a car and the salesmen asking if you want power steering for extra $500.00. Really pi55ed me off.  Stick with a good boat like a Princecraft with a Honda. You will not regret it, the sticker price includes just about everything you will need.  I was told by a Merc dealer last summer (he was forced to sell mercs with his boats because they own all the boat companies now).  If its BLACK you might NOT get BACK, if its Grey, you're OK."
139056,BITEME,2007-12-03 15:35:00,1969,Buy Used
139069,OhioFisherman,2007-12-03 16:30:00,6623,"Just something I have noticed is the boat prices seem very high up there compared to here in Ohio. The exchange rate made that sort of understandable before, now a deal might be here."
139081,mattyk,2007-12-03 16:45:00,2110,"dont buy legend, they are crap!"
139168,irishfield,2007-12-03 20:21:00,26272,Still haven't resolved that with them eh Matt ?
139176,fishinggeek,2007-12-03 20:42:00,325,"Keep them coming!  Thanks for all the input.  So far I like the sounds of Honda 4-strokes are good, Legend is no good, and maybe buying from the States.  What is it like to buy from the States?  Is there a lot of paperwork?  Are there brokers that will do it for a small fee?"
139196,icefisherman,2007-12-03 21:15:00,952,"  I am doing it right now. Just got the form from RIV today. Piece of Cake. Will probably take the trailer to CT tomorrow. There are brockers but they'll charge you lot of money and for what? You can do it all yourself...10 min at the border...and that is it.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
139245,Mike the Pike,2007-12-03 23:03:00,3421,I have a Lund but I did notice when I went to BPS that they had attractive deals on tracker boat packages .You seem to get alot of boat for less.  I don't know alot about them but they look pretty decent.Good Luck with your purchase.
139309,Rizzo,2007-12-04 03:12:00,4754,I've got a Lowe that wasn't very expensive and I've been very happy with it.
