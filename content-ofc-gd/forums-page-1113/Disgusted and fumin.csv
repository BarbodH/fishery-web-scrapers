139202,HTHM,2007-12-03 21:53:00,4082,"Ask yourself, ""when is the last day that I went through that I did everything by the book and as I should have?"" Cops are people too, and are able to make mistakes like the rest of us. That being said, if he was just hightailing it cause he could, then a slap upside the head is warrented. I speed as well, and when I am pulled over, I accept my ticket with the proper amount of humility because I was in the wrong."
139207,Terry,2007-12-03 22:08:00,14456,"I disagree with much that has been said  the cop should have the lights or siren on to  warn people this cop was breaking the law and a cop has to be held to a higher standard, if a cop will break one law. How many other laws is he breaking....he was putting peoples lives at risk and this guy gets to carry a gun and need to use his common sense to deal with people and situations daily.........  he wanted to be a cop he gets paid well to be a cop he needs to act like one"
139237,Fisherman,2007-12-03 22:51:00,7201," Kindly enlighten us which section of the OHTA ""allows"" this."
139238,nautifish,2007-12-03 22:52:00,1416,It was not my intention for this post to start flamming the OPP....  I agree there are alot of good cops out there & they do a tremendous job.  But this actually scared the bejeepers out of me. It bothered me all night all i kept thinking was why did he not have any lights flashing atleast? to warn other drivers coming the opposite way. It would have been tragic had he caused a head on collision right on the actual lift bridge over the water that feeds out to lake erie.  Thankgod it did not happen but what botherd me was it could have and so easily.  As for reporting him not sure how i could not even see the number plate sign on the vehicle infront of me it was so thick with fog and he just tore donkey up the road so fast and we do not allways have local town cops in town.  Anyway i  had my rant and just wanted a question answered so thankyou FishnNAutographs.  Nautifish.
139243,Big Cliff,2007-12-03 23:00:00,6899,"Well, the first thing that comes to mind for me is ""do 100 things right and no one remembers, do 1 thing wrong and no one forgets""! Cops are people too, there are good and bad ones, fortunatly most of them are good. I'd want to know the facts before I made a judgement call but I would always give them the benifit of the doubt (oh wait, I do that with everyone!) LOL  I think this is a really good thread though, informative and thought provoking."

139321,nautifish,2007-12-04 04:21:00,1416,  Exactly!
139329,outdoorguy61,2007-12-04 05:36:00,220,"There was a case in Kingston, where an officer killed a very very well respected and well liked business owner. I believe the name wa Quatrochi sp? and there was a heck of a lot of trouble relating to this with the officer not having lights or sirens or some such things on. I bet it could be googled and it happened about 7 years ago if my memory serves me correctly.  outdoorguy61"
139350,Dano,2007-12-04 11:01:00,719," Who intends to go out in traffic and kill someone?  As for judging, well I guess you wont officialy unless you are part of the SIU, but turning a blind eye wont help anything either. I cant believe some folks still think cops are above scrutiny."
139400,fishing n autograph,2007-12-04 14:51:00,2540,"  We are far from being above scrutiny......we are watched closer than anyone and often treated worse than criminals.....people choose to hate us based on the uniform we wear and some will be happy to kill us based on that fact. Not based on who we are as a person, but for the uniform we wear. But who are the ones they call when they need help?  Yes, some of us make bad decisions and i'm not defending the O.Dot whatsoever because most of them are too intense....hell they give other coppers tickets including my deputy chief lol....hell they'd give Julian Fantino, their commish a ticket. But our job is like everyone elses, people make mistakes and sometimes they drive like idiots, but unlike your job, not everyone is watching everything you do. And when you make a mistake, it's not in every newspaper in ontario.  Oh and BTW, SIU are relentless. They investigate you even when you're not involved in an incident. I have been investigated just for being in the police station when something happened. Yes it's necessary because we need to be accountable, but sometimes they are absolutely brutal which is why we need a lawyer present whenever they talk to us."
139448,Canuck2fan,2007-12-04 16:45:00,1444,"To answer the question of whether it was legal or not is pretty simple..... Did he get a ticket for it? If no, then it was ""legal"" as in the category of he got away with it, just like many of us do on a daily basis when it comes to rules of the road so therefore it must have been ""legal""..... It doesn't sound like it was very sensible though.  I went to school with a couple of guys who joined law enforcement and the one thing that amazes me is the stories they love to tell about how they have top ended cruisers, personal vehicles, even snowmobiles while having another officer check their speed with a radar gun on some pretty public roads..... Heard of as related by those same guys and have seen with my own eyes a lot things done by officers that make me wonder what laws apply to whom. However, as stated when any of us need a cop or a rescue vehicle for us or our loved ones we do want it arrive FAST... and I don't think too many of stop to ask did you happen to break any rules of the road to get here so quickly?  So Nautifish if it shook you up so much you really should call the local detachment and inform them of what you saw. If nothing else it might give the officer in question pause to do something like that again if he knows the citizens in the area are watching."
139648,Fisherman,2007-12-05 00:24:00,7201,"Never judged a group by the actions of a few,  every agency is ""different"", as for your comment about the HTA and throwing that info out the door when you hit the road, my, my, people sometimes make comments when stressed or nervous, but to put that on a public board and try to get respect, as an ex, I'm embarrassed and I'll leave it at that."
139656,fishing n autograph,2007-12-05 00:44:00,2540,"  It was a joke....an misunderstood, I meant that I didn't know the exact section of the HTA because when I was at the college I had it pretty much memorized.....gimme a break man"
139130,fishing n autograph,2007-12-03 18:28:00,2540," To answer your question is this legal?  Yes it is. The Highway Traffic Act allows us to drive like that in the course of our duties. However, keep in mind that in some situations driving fast w/o lights and sirens is necessary. Nothing tells a bad guy to run faster when he hears sirens in the distance. What the HTA does say is that we have to stop at all stop signs and red lights with lights on. It doesn't say what kind of stop though hehe  As well, always remember that no one who drives in the GTA pays attention to whats behind them and they very rarely hear sirens. I've gone to emergency calls and was stuck behind a driver with blinders for 4-5kms with lights and the most annoying siren i had and they still wouldn't move.  I can't vouch for the copper that was driving like that, but there may or may not have been a reason.  The job's tough and everyone is a critic until they need help and then they are our best friends"
139140,Gerritt,2007-12-03 18:57:00,6129,  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!
139146,tapout,2007-12-03 19:19:00,166,"Thanks to FishnNAutographs for clarifying that what the officer did was LEGAL.  But does that mean he should've put other people in jeopardy?  Does the apprehension of a burglar supercede the life of an innocent citizen?  Now I know some will say it could've been something more serious like someone got injured or worst by someone else maliciously.  If that was the case then it would seem the officer, in his course of duties, had more concern for catching the perp then helping the victim if there was one.  I can't see how what this officer did, according to nautifish's description of the weather at the time, was justified.  I am by no means bashing the force, but this officer in my opinion had put the public in danger and not lived up to the "" To Serve and Protect"" motto...the ""Protect"" part being cited here.  Yes we all make mistakes, even police officers.  But when we, as civilians make mistakes we have to pay for them.  I believe if an officer made a bad judgement call, such as the topic and situation of nautifish's rant, then I believe he should be accountable and be punished the same as all of us, if something serious had happened.  Obviously he can't be charged with dangerous driving because the Law permits him to do so in the ""line of his duties"" .  We live in a country that purports itself as a land where ALL people are equal.Last time I checked a police officer was a person.  One more thing , the stop sign comment from  FishnNAutographs stating the HTA doesn't specify what kind of stop?  I assume you are refering to a ""rolling stop"" where you don't actually stop.  I know someone who had gotten a ticket for doing that so to me that also shows that the police recognize a ""rolling stop"" as a dangerous and ticketable offense.  Even though its legal doesn't make it right.   Thats my opinion and probably not even worth 2cents.  Tony."
139148,fishing n autograph,2007-12-03 19:29:00,2540,"""I believe he should be accountable and be punished the same as all of us, if something serious had happened. Obviously he can't be charged with dangerous driving because the Law permits him to do so in the ""line of his duties"" .   yes he would be if something serious had happened, and it was his fault on top of that, he would be charged under the Police Services Act and would probably lose a rank and up to as much as 150 hours of pay all of his vacation, not including his sick time......and in some cases where a life was lost in a collision there have been times were the officer had been so grief striken and guilty and committed suicide"
139149,fishing n autograph,2007-12-03 19:33:00,2540," i was kidding, we have to stop"

139157,Weeds,2007-12-03 19:53:00,782,You can't blame the police officers. It's part of the police package that they disconnect the signals at the factory. Saves money on bulbs.
139159,lew,2007-12-03 19:56:00,12767,"Police cars, ambulances and fire trucks are allowed certain leeways when responding to emergency calls, but must still basically adhere to the rules of the road. Their permitted to go thru red lights & stop signs but must 1st come to a full stop and then proceed with caution once they've determined that all traffic has stopped for them. If there is an accident caused by the emergency vehicle hitting a car coming thru a green light, the driver of the emergency vehicle can be charged.  It's the same as speeding, it's permitted, but only when the traffic conditions warrant it.  Back in the day, people respected emergency vehicles and what they represented, and would ALWAYS clear a path to allow them thru, but times have changed drastically over the years and now sirens and red lights are basically ignored by many drivers.  I saw a huge change in drivers attitude over 3 + decades of driving emergency vehicles thru city streets, but that's another story.....  Nautifish, if you have a complaint against the officer driving that car, your most certainly allowed to lodge a complaint with the Police Dept. and I'm sure you'll get the answer your looking for.  Trouble is though, when people see a police car speeding, they complain he's going too fast, but if they find someone breaking into their own home and call police for help, they complain cause it took too long for the police to arrive.  When folks get caught in a speed trap, they complain that the coppers are picking on them, but when they get hit by a speeding car, they ask why aren't the police cracking down on speeders.  Every one of us has coffee breaks at work, but when the police stop at Timmies for a break, everone calls them lazy bums and asks why aren't they out catching the bad guys.  Coppers are damned if they do.........and then their damned if they don't.  Just my dimes worth."
139169,Headhunter,2007-12-03 20:23:00,5703,"Yup, just as Lew said it! I find myself having to restrain myself when I see the flashing lights in the background and people RACING to get AHEAD OF THEM! It's usually at that time that I hope it's their family member they are putting in jeopary vs some poor sap who needs emergency help! We live in a very me me me world and unfortunately it's only getting worse! HH"
139185,pikehunter,2007-12-03 20:51:00,1659, I beg to differ. I have seen it a couple of times when a driver was slow pulling over to give right of way but here in Hamilton and Burlington drivers could perhaps be a little more conscientious?
