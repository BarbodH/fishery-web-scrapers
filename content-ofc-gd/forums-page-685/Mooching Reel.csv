I do some downrigger for Lakers mostly and saw advertised at BPS Mooching reels used for downrigging,trolling, etc.   Just wondering if anyone uses these for downrigging and what would be the advantages of this kind of reel. I assume that it has a drag system of some sort but is it like you see out west when palm the reel or is that something totally different??? Your input would be appreciated!!  Thanks"
465530,Guest gbfisher,2010-05-12 13:02:00,0,It's just like a Pin except with a drag system. 1:1 ratio is the idea. Knuckle busters.
465532,The Birdfish,2010-05-12 13:04:00,73,advance it what? I see the dis. alot of reeling for 100 plus ft of line
465533,hookerdown,2010-05-12 13:06:00,110,"I use a Diawa mooching reel for downrigging on Lake Ontario.  The drag on Mooching reels is usually 1:1, so there is not an advantage over anything technque.  Its strickly all about the enjoyment of the fight.  Having a screamer on a Mooching is unbeatable IMO.  Mooching is popular out in BC and is used here to a lesser extent.   Instead of using acutal Mooching reels some guys use large arbour fly reels.  The price range for mooching can range from $30 up over $500, like everything you get what you pay for.  If you are just starting out, go with a entry level mooching reel, and if you start getting into downrigging or going on the Great Lakes with any type of frequency than you might want to upgrade your equipment.  I haven't heard guys using them on Lakers though.  James Hookerdown"

I'd recommend it, if you wanted to search for a good used specimen.  http://www.mitchellreels.net/index.php?option=com_easygallery&act=categories&cid=530&Itemid=72"
465599,POLLIWOGG,2010-05-12 16:31:00,835,"The Mitchell mooching reels were used a lot when we started out rigging, they were a cheep way to hold a lot of line. Ask around and somebody might give you one if they don't use it anymore.  Problem with them was the mono line would expand and distort the reel and bind on the shaft, you had to put on a dacron backer or I would wrap foam weatherstrip around the bottom of the reel to give room to expand.  I use one on a 12' noodle rod with 10lb test Andie, I tried lighter line but the mechanics of rigging gave me some break offs. Holds almost enough line for your fish to reach the horizon."
465625,capt bruce,2010-05-12 17:34:00,820,"Mitchell mooching reels, I have 6 sets with 13 foot fenwick med action rigger sticks , when we go out to the depths 350 + feet in the summer (middle of july the best )and troll the top 20 feet for bows , I pull these out for the experenced guys , 10 pound big game and I try to stop boat for most fish. one on one no gear ration in your favor , makes for fun fun fun , palm the reel for extra drag , much rather do this than drag them in with 20 pound braid heavy rod and drown them on the surface with the boat and high gear ration reel . Only trouble with the mitchells are the drag disks ,I learned to lightly oil them with some thin gear oil as they heated up on long runs and seized up , a little oil did the trick and most of the reels i have are over 10 years old ,but in the biggining before the oil I seized up a few, new drag disks and all was well . Great way to fish ."
