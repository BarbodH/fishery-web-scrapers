Cabela's has some jon boat swivel mounts, but, a few guys tell me they slide around a bit too much...really have to clamp them down.  I would like to have the swivel option regardless of the type I buy...doesn't have to be pedestal, and, I will drill if necessary.  The above picture shows the layout of the boat...looking to mount one at the front (there is a space between the seat and the very front of the boat) and the other at the back, by the motor. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks!"
464964,archer379,2010-05-10 21:16:00,277,check the for sale section i have seats for sale but not trying to get you to buy them unless you want but if you look at the picture of the mounts i used they worked great and easy to take out for the winter or what ever.
464976,ohhenrygsr,2010-05-10 21:56:00,947,Hey Frankie the mounts that we put on our Prosport series are these.  See if you can pick them up from your local area.   your Legend seats should have the bases attached to them.  Let me know if you need help

465015,archer379,2010-05-10 23:04:00,277,  these are the ones i was talking about work great
465021,asdve23rveavwa,2010-05-10 23:24:00,2690,"Thanks, guys...those mounts look promising...easy to remove the chairs if necessary as well."
465236,SylvanOwner,2010-05-11 14:48:00,266,Those are the types of bases I've used in my aluminum as well and they work very well.  I strongly suggest installing some sort of backing plate or at least very large washers to prevent them from pulling out.
465319,jimmer,2010-05-11 19:33:00,2730,I went a completely different way.  There are these metal channels that you can buy that are placed along the front of your bench seat and then there is a swivel on the bottom of the seat that interlocks with this channel.  It is very sturdy and will not tip over when you lean back on the seat.  It also allows you to move the seat along the bench to whatever position you want.  Just tip the seat forward and you can remove it for storage without having to remove screws or nuts and bolts.  They sell these setups at most marine supply stores.  Bought mine just outside of Lindsay.  PM me if you want more info.

466059,Gerritt,2010-05-13 18:36:00,6129,Here are the ones I installed on my boat. They work like a charm! Seat locks into place so you can trailer with the seats installed etc. and remove then with the boat is in the driveway.  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product_10151_-1_10001_100755_225008005_225000000_225008000_225-8-5   G
466071,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-13 19:02:00,10439,"  We have 2 different versions of those mounts on our boats. The ones in those pictures and some that have 1 1/2"" pins with srings 4 or 5 times as big as the ones on the 3/4"" pins. They're real pogo sticks, saves the butt and back in rough water though."
466257,pikehunter,2010-05-14 00:28:00,1659,"Got one like Jimmer pictured on my tiller seat and a clamp down on another. Both have swivels also. One hint, don't lubricate the runners with wd40 or a silicone spray. You'll be sliding right off the end when you hit rough water or turn. Also tie the seat down with a bungee cord when traveling to keep it from sliding out the end."
