465511,TJQ,2010-05-12 11:49:00,7806,Cool.. get em out while they are young..
465591,limeyangler,2010-05-12 16:04:00,5204," Yeah, my thoughts exactly TJ, will be taking him out ice fishing this winter for sure!"
465595,kickingfrog,2010-05-12 16:17:00,8333,That's great! I think we need to get my son Ryan and Jack together for a play date on the water. The 35 hour round trip might be a bit of a challenge though.
465795,limeyangler,2010-05-13 00:58:00,5204,  Now that would be cool KF!  But yeah...the trip sounds like a marathon!
