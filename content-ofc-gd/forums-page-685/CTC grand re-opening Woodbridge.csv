And  I don't guarantee that they have enough of them, but what I just saw it's local and they may have enough.   I just got back (my wife works there and the manager is a friend) and they have a great sale going on until May 16 due to the make over.  Here are some sample items, sorry I can't list them all and the flyer (only for the store's sales area) is to big to scan!  Adult deluxe PFD reg 39.99 on for 14.97  2 gal. air compressor reg 99.99 for 38.88  Stud sensor 4.97 (leave this one alone guys)  5-drawer tool storage cabinet combo 219.99 for 84.97  Drill bits reg 29.99 for 7.97  Ram-x 15 1/2' 3-seat canoe 37"" beam 800lb capacity reg 649.99 389.97  Emerald Cedar trees reg 39.99  on for 19.99  Garden hose  29.99 for 9.97  And there is more!"
