465405,12footspringbok,2010-05-11 23:22:00,459,Well i've wasted more than a few feet of my expensive roll of 50lb Seaguar fluorocarbon trying to tie up some leaders for pike fishing next weekend. I tried the polymer knot with little success i can barely even pull the knot tight enough to get all of the slack out of the knot even with lots of lube. The improved clinch knot seems to be working alright except the line seems to get a little kinked almost and looks rather unsighly and crooked after pulling the line through. Anyways i was wondering if anyone has any tips for tying with this stuff or any knots that are easier tying with before i run out of line. Any help would be much appreciated.

I just googled seagaur, found their site & the following: http://www.seaguar.com/seaguar-community/knot-guide.htm  I'll be trying them myself next time I work on tackle, let us know if this helps!

465408,12footspringbok,2010-05-11 23:36:00,459, This is actually the first place i looked for tips. I havent tried the chapstick for lube on the knot tip because i don't have any handy but i have tried vegetable oil and it has helped a bit but i still get the unsightly curve after i pull the line through.
465413,Syn,2010-05-11 23:47:00,519,50lb is not that bad to work with.  80lb and 100 are a pain in the  to tie knots with.  Anyhow I'm thinking a canoe knot   or you can use a big game loop knot but you still should use crimped sleeve to finish it off.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-40nQRTsIg

465422,Syn,2010-05-12 00:06:00,519," +1 I'd rather crimp too but I never tried crimps on such light line 50lb. Easier to crimp 80 lb+ for me because I can see whats going on.  Crimping loop leaders is great though because it does not make the flouro get into very sharp small turns like a knot would and risk weakening it. Also the loop on a crimped leader allows lots of bait movement. Finally, a crimped leader can have a spring (or wire casing) added to the loop to really cut down on the lure abrasions, making the leader last longer."

465442,Raf,2010-05-12 00:54:00,3495,"uni knot works.  you don't need 8 wraps like you do with braid, 4-5 oughta do it  if you need a loop, perfection loop is what I use."
465447,musky66,2010-05-12 01:05:00,273,Leader loop with a  drop of super glue- works great on 130 lb floro- no issues ever.

465495,12footspringbok,2010-05-12 09:22:00,459,Thanks for all the replies i'll try a few of these tonight!
465592,MuskieWannabe,2010-05-12 16:05:00,79,"search ""perfection knot"" on google.  I have begun tying and crimping my own muskie leaders, and I have found that the perfection knot is the best one if you are tying.  It is pretty well the same as the canoe knot but I find it a lot easier to tie."
