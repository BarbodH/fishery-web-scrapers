Now I'm going to try it with the white fish I caught and see if it tastes as good with fresh water fish.  On another note? I have been buying Berkley line for years. But lately been running into a lot of batches that are frail. Bought the new silver pack one and it is a little better. Might have to change mono-lines if this keeps up!  Oh and the fish spreaders? Don't they make the ones with the big ""T"" at the end so it holds the fishes mouth open and it doesn't puncture the mouth? Sure you could wrap hockey tape around the ends but it still is a little dangerous. Doesn't hold the mouth open properly."

465565,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-12 14:43:00,0, Haven't tried the Italian one. Will give it a try. Tried the Cajun but did not like it that much.
465568,Mike Pike,2010-05-12 14:51:00,1332,"Couldn't agree with you more, Johnny, about the Fish Crisp Beer Batter.  Beyond it tasting awesome, it's so quick and easy!  I like to mix mine so it's real thick, and make sure the fillets are patted nice and dry with a cloth so the batter sticks on the fillet nicely."
465619,jediangler,2010-05-12 17:07:00,1923,Roasted Garlic and Butter Fish Crisp is my favourite. I use hockey tape to blunt the ends of my jaw spreader so it doesn't do as much damage to the fish. It's not high-tech but it works.

465665,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-12 18:56:00,0,"Roasted Garlic and Butter is my favorite too  jedi but tried the beer batter and basically went from cooking 2 fillets to about 8, with no left overs. It was that good. Have still yet to try the origional.  Thanks for the tip backbay. Will try uncle buck and also gonna try Chronzy's batter.  I used to never eat fresh water fish but now I love it!!!"
465680,NAW,2010-05-12 19:53:00,4022, You won't be dissapointed.  One of my fav meals
465687,Tom McCutcheon,2010-05-12 20:03:00,627,Johnny; the last time I saw the fish jaw spreaders with the T was at fishing world in Hamilton. I believe that was just last summer.
465690,asdve23rveavwa,2010-05-12 20:19:00,2690,"Roasted garlic and butter/Cajun...about a 60/40 mix.  If you like it a bit spicy, absolutely awesome!!! As far as mono...still prefer Trilene XT in green (6 and 8 lb test...I don't use anything heavier in mono) above any others I have tried."
465715,brifishrgy,2010-05-12 21:37:00,559,"beer batter fish crisp and onions make ""the best"" onion rings .."
465763,Fish Farmer,2010-05-13 00:08:00,2234,"Johnny, I've tried Fish Crisp reg. just as a coating, not bad. I like the Gronzy Breading and batter just as a breading, best, but don't add any salt, it's salty enough. Sometimes it's just preference. That Roasted Garlic & Butter sounds good."
465794,lookinforwalleye,2010-05-13 00:58:00,4399,Try Panko Japanese style bread crumbs and you will forget all about those other mixes!!
465799,Gerritt,2010-05-13 01:05:00,6129,perhaps give my batter a go... spice it as you like...  and give'r!  g
465941,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-13 14:07:00,0,Well hopefully I will be catching a lot of pickerals and I will try all kinds of recipes and post the results.
465945,marth11,2010-05-13 14:19:00,60,"Im to cheap to buy my own breading and batter so I just make my own, all you need is flour, salt, black pepper, paprika  for 8 fillets of perch  3 tbls of flour 1.5 tbls of salt 1 tsp of black pepper 1 tbls of paprika  im a big fan of salt if you can tell"
466297,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-14 02:02:00,0," I tried that too with lemon and parsley. If you substitute the flour with pancake mix and/or corn meal, it makes a great batter."
