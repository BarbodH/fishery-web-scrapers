465279,aplumma,2010-05-11 17:09:00,6896,Why would you think that a video with angry music and cuss words would entice people to take a trip with you?   Art
465463,waterwolf,2010-05-12 01:59:00,556, i don't get it either
465498,fish_fishburn,2010-05-12 10:24:00,1311,Marketing 101. Change the music dude.
465509,Jer,2010-05-12 11:41:00,1426,"First time I heard ""Rage Against the Machine"" musta been almost 20 years ago. I thought ""Wow, what a bunch of angry, young men!"". Then I went and bought the CD.  Flashback to the good old head-banging days."
465517,danbouck,2010-05-12 12:25:00,4380,I like Rage but.....
465520,blaque,2010-05-12 12:30:00,2419,If youve ever seen Tom Morello (RATM guitarist) speak in an interview.......hes probably the least angry individual ive ever listened too lol. Quite a detach from the band name and album cover art LOL
465574,ctranter,2010-05-12 15:16:00,543,"moreover these ""gangsta"" introduce the same moral fabric that people on this site tends to promote (anti-govt corruption, pro environment, pro ""people"", to a younger generation.  I dont get it... you carp that ""kids these days _______________"", and then mock the mediums that promote your shared message?  I love classic, and contemporary rock, but put your bias aside.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't it annoying when your parents (Grandparents to my generation) failed to grasp the ""new"" music, 40-50 years ago?  That being said the vast majority of Rage listeners have no clue what they are talking about."
465912,blaque,2010-05-13 12:44:00,2419," Im not sure who this is directed at lol, but to speak for myself....I Love RATM lol. Not mocking them, in fact ive always thought its been kinda funny how intense their message has always been yet they're such nice guys. Took me a little while, but I also kinda like (maybe) how they branched into and kinda transformed from RATM into Audioslave. I didnt like it at first, but its grown on me as an admirable thing instead of dragging on and on with the same sound, they grew into something new and different."
465915,Headhunter,2010-05-13 12:55:00,5703,It doesn't remind me of anything! HH
465990,Mykester,2010-05-13 16:16:00,241,"LOL @ people finding this kind of music ""heavy"" and ""extreme."""
