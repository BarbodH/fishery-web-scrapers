464582,Billy Bob,2010-05-09 13:26:00,5865,"My younger son is still driving my 2001 (purchased 4/00)Saturn Coupe SC2 and loves it. It's loaded with even leather interior and still gets 38 mpg on the highway. It recently turned 100K and still looks new. I ""HOPE"" to someday get it back from him and drive it as my daily vehicle....but he said when he's done with it I'll need a tow truck to get it."
464599,moparhawk,2010-05-09 14:45:00,146,"Just a thought but the emissions warrenty is usually mandated by the goverment. (here in the states anyway, may be the same in god's country) Often up to 80000 mi. If it wont pass emissions call saturn."

Sure would solve all the engine problems and make it not worth repairing."

465724,paulyboy83,2010-05-12 22:05:00,54,"I had a 98 Saturn.  Biggest piece of crap I ever owned!  The rough idling could be the engine coolant temperature sensor.  Relatively inexpensive fix, located on the side of the block. Mine went and I had to actually push the gas pedal to start it.  Short time later, tranny went. Apparently a common breakdown on these cars. Tried 3 different trannies from the wrecker before the tranny shop told me to come and get the car and don't come back.  They were getting sick and tired of pulling the motor out and putting it back in.  Drove the piece of crap home in D1 at 25 km and called Teen Challenge Farm and donated it to them.  They came and picked it up and gave me a charitable donation receipt for $900 to use on my income tax.  Best thing to come of that heap!  PB"
465729,TC1OZ,2010-05-12 22:20:00,987,Scrap it and get a better used car! Sounds like its going to cost more than a used car to fix it...
465753,vinnimon,2010-05-12 23:37:00,2593,"THE CONCLUSION Well it was sent in for repairs and emissions.Monday it was done and passed the E test.Well, we went to get the sticker.The VIN on the test didnt match.  We went back and showed them.After talking they took the vin from the door, not the dash.Then I remembered years ago it was side swiped and the door was replaced. Anyway the retest failed and failed again.We had quit a bit of work done at NO CHARGE  Finally it passed,took 5 tries and a few repairs.They even fixed the ABS, and a sticky calipar at no charge.The only thing we paid for was a used egr valve for 50 bucks. The things we forget about, OH and she is happy as well.  THE END!"

Well its off to the exhaust shop,and emmisions afterwards.Note to self(tell wife I TOLD YOU SO).Anyway it wont pass.Irratic idle prob,possibly in a tranny solenoid.Oh and the egr is leaking threw the diaphram,HMMMMMM, NO PAS!

464339,SlowPoke,2010-05-08 17:32:00,2984,"I'm on the flipside. I want to keep our van but my wife wants a new car. It's been by far the most reliable vehicle we've had and it runs perfect. The downside is that she's been driving it since new ('97) and I think she's just tired of it. I might have to replace it because every time I want something (new Terrova) I hear about the van. The funny part of it is; when we have bad weather I'll offer the 4WD Suburban and she declines. She says she's more comfortable driving the 2WD Astro in the snow!!!  Getting back to your question... when is enough, enough? I guage immediate and upcoming repairs vs. monthly payments. When the van need a new transmission ($1600) I pondered whether or not we'd get another 4 months worry free out of it vs. paying $400/mo on a new vehicle. You can say the car isn't worth putting the money into but it's usually cheaper than replacing it. In other words, if I knew the van needed a new engine now and a set of tires in a couple of months, it'd be gone. Our maintenance costs have yet to exceed $2000/yr. It helps when you can do a lot of repairs yourself."
464341,lew,2010-05-08 17:44:00,12766,My wife and I have an  understanding......I don't tell her how to cook and she doesn't tell me when I can or can't buy a new vehicle.  I buy a brand new truck every 3 - 5 years and she makes the best roast beef dinner you'll find anywhere.  It's a system that's kept us VERY happily married for nearly 44 years.

464344,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-08 17:53:00,0,"There's been quite a few problems with Saturns, if it is as bad as you say, it would not be worth it to invest more money into it. Though it sounds like financially you have no choice so I say fix it, and when the car breaks down, you have the I told you so card to play.lol"
464345,nofish4me,2010-05-08 17:58:00,404,"....or you could always say: ""Dang honey, that was a surprise!"" What do you think we should do now?"" Hahaha  It always makes someone feel better, when they are included in the process."

464381,vinnimon,2010-05-08 20:01:00,2593,"OK,a little history on the vehicle.My dad cringed at first buying it new.He liked the v8 chevys as I do.Well he he was injured at work and needed something economical.And it was to this day.He liked the fact that the door panels bounced,LOL.And truely enough I had to put it to the test with a shopping cart in the summer of 95.LOL.Thats me at the time.LOL.Anyway it was good,clean and quick.Well Dada past away and mom drove it.It was time for a new car.Bonus,free car for the wife,ah no!2400 bucks in show room condition.No prob!4weeks later it looked like a tornado went threw it. Anyway, shortly after a CURB HIT HER!.NEW SUBFRAME,I put in.NOT HAppy at all.Then 2 rims a month later.(I didnt ask)I KNEW!!!!!!!!!!AGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!Some little problems due to idiots trying to steel it.
