465080,young_one,2010-05-11 01:33:00,620,"Drove down to Deseronto on Friday after work for my family's annual walleye trip at Mohawk Bay Trailer Park. The water level was really low, had to launch at the public dock in town.  Sat morning, the day started with calm lake and no rain, and it progressed to drizzle and walleye chop and around noon it was downpour and huge white caps!  Mother nature threw everything at my father and I, but we still manage to catch 4 fish in the morning. I got two 5lbs while my dad ended the morning with two smaller eaters. The fish were not turned off.    Went back to the trailer and napped until afternoon, went to Napanee for a tourist trip. When we got back to the trailer, the wind was pretty calm, my mom asked us, ""Why dont you guys go fishing?"" And thats wat we did and finished the day with the rest of our limit, and threw a couple back. The fishing was even better in the afternoon! We landed about 7 or 8 walleye, we kept the bigger ones around 2lb and culled the rest.    a few nice eaters    Sunday morning, I woke up at 5AM and it was freezing! The cold front finally hit us. I drove to Picton to meet up with Capt.Fishhunter, Walleyedreamer, Carm and Jose for the hookup posted a few days ago, while my dad continue to fish the Deseronto area.  We could tell the fish were inactive, and getting them to bite was tricky. Fishhunter had some effective patterns figured out the day before, even with the major temperature drop(cold front), his pattern continue to produce for us. We ended the day with 8 fish! My dad got skunked at Deseronto, the fish were complete shut down with the techniques he was using.    Size 11 shoes, biggest fish was 7lb!    Complete package, full service!    We had a great time on the boat, it was warm and relaxing. We joked about everything and time sure flies when you are having fun! Thanks Fishhunter (Lloyd) for a great outing, I'm sure everyone learnt something new on that trip."
