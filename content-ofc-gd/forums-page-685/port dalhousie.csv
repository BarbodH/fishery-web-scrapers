465924,west lake charlie,2010-05-13 13:29:00,40,Any adivce for spring fishing out of port dalhousie on lake O? What wind is best and any lure combos that pay off this time of year? Thanks for all your input
465943,marth11,2010-05-13 14:12:00,60,"port d is abnormally low this year and the trout bite is slow as well, you might get lucky on spoons and medium diving crankbaits, you'll catch trout and pike on those"

The hurricane winds on the weekend and a steady East/ Northeast wind has been keeping most dudes on shore.  To answer your questions east and northeast winds over 20km/h are pretty much a no-go down here expect 4'+ chop,it usually takes the lake a day or so to settle aswell.Those winds are coming right down the lake and build up waves quick,however they can pile up some warmer water and fishing can be good once the wind starts coming in from the south/southwest. A strong Northwest can also make for difficult conditions aswell as north and fishing is tough in these winds aswell.  As for baits spoons,spoons,spoons and spin doctor/fly combos and did I mention spoons hehehehe.Use them off the riggers or wire/dippsey or braid/dippsey combos, 5 colour leadcore is a good ticket aswell right now."

When you get on them doubles and triples are the normal these are coho so when you hit them you get lots, there hitting the spoons in the prop wash aswell."
