465583,msp,2010-05-12 15:40:00,1336,Does anyone know where I can have my boat re-carpeted at a reasonable cost ?
465587,fish_fishburn,2010-05-12 15:54:00,1311,I did mine myself because I was blown away at the estimates I got to have it done. My 20 ft bassboat was about 1500.00. The carpet cost me 200 and about 50 to 60 hrs of labour and I was done. Turned out perfect.

465611,GoneFishin,2010-05-12 16:57:00,349," Millwork sells it, not sure if there's one up your way, but a lot of flooring stores would probably sell it. I payed 6.99 a yard for mine and put it down with a spray on epoxy."
465613,SylvanOwner,2010-05-12 16:58:00,266,  Got mine in the GTA.  Home Depot and RONA sell marine carpet and it is inexpensive but it is the loop style so your hooks get caught in it.  The better stuff doesn't catch hooks.  Dan
465614,Garry2Rs,2010-05-12 16:59:00,1425,I bought marine carpet at Lowe's in the states. Why don't you see if they have it in their Hamilton store too? Garry2R's
