Bob
465093,darsky,2010-05-11 01:44:00,586,"I am comped at MGM so I stay there. But yeah, NYNY is a lot of fun-do the roller coaster !!"
465129,Ben_Daniels,2010-05-11 02:31:00,435,The savings from that deal won't cover the first 10 minutes at the tables  -Ben
465255,Billy Bob,2010-05-11 15:58:00,5865," It will if you know how to play Blackjack...  Vegas is a GREAT Vacation even for those who never gamble..I'm not a big gambler but the wife is very good playing Blackjack...where else in the world can you get a 5 star hotel for $55 a night other then Vegas...and as I said there are MANY things to do and see in Vegas besides gambling and many are FREE (my favorite word)... Just walking up and down the 4 mile strip and seeing the volcano at the Mirage or the fountains in the lake at the Bellagio not to mention the Pirate fight at Treasure Island...I could go on and on but that's just a fraction of what to do for those who don't gamble much like me... I do play blackjack and only play to stay even and enjoy the great (FREE) cocktail service that only the casino's in Vegas are famous for...oh, and did I mention how those cocktail girls dress....  ...even the women that are seen ALL OVER VEGAS are hot hot and hotter...each trying to out do the next one...even my wife points them out for me....it's nice to have that extra set of eyes while looking for eye candy...  So hopefully I helped someone save some hard earned cash on the hotel bill if they were thinking of heading to Sin City...an adult play ground...  :devil:  Bob"
465261,Harrison,2010-05-11 16:12:00,2202,"Money you bring to Vegas, stays in Vegas.  For me anywhoo.  Everywhere you turn it's money.  Looking forward to going in July however."
465263,Billy Bob,2010-05-11 16:16:00,5865, TRUE very TRUE...but can you name just one vacation destination where you come home with more money then when you left home...in Vegas it does happen (just not to me).
465266,ctranter,2010-05-11 16:25:00,543,"  This if often overlooked.  I went to Vegas for the first time last August (on a super cheap deal), and spent a total on 16$ on 1$ slot machines, and only because I got loaded.  There is plenty to do in Vegas aside from gamble.  The Grand Canyon is only about 2-3 hours away and day trips are reasonable priced.  As well, each hotel is an attraction in itself.  Last year they were building the CitiCenter hotel, which was just ridiculously big (imagine any given full square block in the financial district downtown Toronto).  I know the typical response is ""well who wants to go on vacation to look at hotels"", trust me they are stunning both inside and out.  You have a plethora of world class restaurants. Every kind of live entertainment possible... reasonably priced  The only negative is the superficiality and cost of the night clubs and bars.  I am lucky to date a beautiful actress/model, as otherwise the Bouncers at the club will look at you and tell you to your face whether or not you are adequately attractive to enter."
465372,Sandbag,2010-05-11 21:53:00,533,There are some great deals to be had right now for sure.  My wife and I just returned from 4 nights at The Bellagio.  With flights included it was just under $1000.  Not too bad if you ask me.  Four nights is definitely enough though.  I just got my liver back from the dry cleaners!  Cheers  Craig
465391,Billy Bob,2010-05-11 22:38:00,5865," I agree, four nights for anyone who has never been to Vegas while three nights for frequent visitors does fine. This year we are treating our two sons and girlfriends to a trip there in August. Might be the last time we can do a family vacation before my oldest son is deployed.  Bob"
465503,Billy Bob,2010-05-12 11:06:00,5865,Since I'm on the mailing list I just received another offer. This time from the Luxor Hotel and Casino in Vegas with rates at $36 per night. https://reservations.mgmmirage.com/bookingengine.aspx?pid=LUX&host=promo&code=LRATE48
465540,fishing n autograph,2010-05-12 13:27:00,2540,there's also a deal with Jet Blue to Vegas. Fly from Buffalo to Vegas for under $50....
465589,Billy Bob,2010-05-12 15:57:00,5865, Jet Blue does NOT have a direct NON STOP flight to Vegas...if you don't mind flying around to Boston or NY first and then to Vegas Jet Blue might be your choice...I check the dates with Jet Blue when we are going and would be $300 MORE than taking the NON STOP flight we are taking with Southwest Airlines which is the only non stop flight to Vegas...our first trip there in 2002 we used Delta...what a MISTAKE...a delayed flight out of Buffalo cost us our connection in Cinci so it ended up taking 14 hours just to get to Vegas...Southwest flights (non stop) and you're in Sin City in 4 hours or LESS.  Bob
