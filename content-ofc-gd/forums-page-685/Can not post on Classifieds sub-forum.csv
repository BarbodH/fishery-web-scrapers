It said ""You cannot start a new topic"" at the right corner of the webpage. So just wondering if there is any requirement to the users for posting new topic or reply on ""Classifieds"". For the other sub-forum everything is perfect.  Sorry everyone but I don't know where I should talk to so just post my question here.  Thanks. "
