The largest pike was caught on my light action walleye jigging rod, beauty fight. The next day we threw baits for pike many follows and a few hammer handles in the boat but that was it. The evening walleye bite started slow but we found a few, some in the slot had to go back, as well as some dinks, with a few perch to keep things going.      as for Saturday snow and wind = cards and Wisers...."
