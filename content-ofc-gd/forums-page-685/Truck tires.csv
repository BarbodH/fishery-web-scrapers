465238,bdox,2010-05-11 14:50:00,329,"I put on a set of 31x10.5 Goodyear Duratracs last summer and they are kick ass tires. They got me out of a bunch of sticky situations, except once when they weren't big enough to keep my diff off the ground"
465241,Canuck2fan,2010-05-11 15:01:00,1444,I have to agree with the Michelins over the Goodyears.... I had a set of Wranglers on my jeep one time and I couldn't stop or steer in the wet or snow. Threw on some Michelin M/S for winter and NEVER had an issue off road or on the highway. I did keep the Wranglers for the summer as they looked good but were pure crap on anything but a sunny day....
465249,DanD,2010-05-11 15:33:00,2223,"If people are throwing out pricing; I can sell & install a set of LT265/70R17 load range C (6ply) Silent Armor for $1120.00; that’s with OTS (Ontario Tire Stewardship fee), valve stems, balancing and tax’s included. HST will not affect tire pricing; we’ve always have had to charge both P & GST; 13 % is 13% whatever you want to call it. Or the pro-grade load range E (10 ply) Silent Armor for $1196.95. all in. The load capacity of the C tire is 2470lbs@50psi compared to the E that is 3195lbs@80 psi. The E load rated tire will ride somewhat harder but it’ll carry almost any weight you throw at it. The Silent Armor doesn’t actually have the AT rating but Goodyear’s propaganda sheet says it’s a “Premium on-/off- road tire”? Then there’s an $80.00 mail-in rebate on a set of four. If you’re interested; my shop is here in London. 519-681-3844  PS: I just did a quick count of different Goodyear Wrangler tires and I found 13 types in the main listing and didn’t look at how many sub groups there were. So if you buy the wrong tire for your application sure they’re going to seem like crap.  Dan."
465274,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-11 16:47:00,10439, The E rated tires shoud not be purchased for general purpose use. The only negative reviews I saw out of over 300 I read were people who bough the E rated tires and weren't hauling an in bed camper or 5th wheel. The complaints were a hash ride. Every single review I read about the C rated tires was glowing and there wasn't a single complaint. If you do need the E rated for heavy hauling make sure to air them down when not hauling to improve the ride.
465284,jjcanoe,2010-05-11 17:45:00,744,"A second set of snows are way, way out of the budget, and snow/mud traction is important to me. Is there a big difference in fuel economy with between the A/T's and the all seasons? Don't do any in bed hauling other than gear for the cottage/camping,(a few 100 lbs at most)....  I do tow my boat here and there it weighs in at around 1000lbs but I'm guessing that it wouldn't affect the load range of the tire I would need, (correct me if I'm wrong)  jjcanoe"
465289,Raf,2010-05-11 18:02:00,3495," I have not noticed any difference in fuel economy.  They may or may not be a little noisier, especially if you go with a really aggressive tire -- that's a non-issue for me but, some people don't like it -- it certainly won't be like running a bias ply mud terrain though.   I think an A/T tire is for you then."
465296,DanD,2010-05-11 18:33:00,2223,"The C load range is likely all you would need weight carrying wise. As for the traction; I just called my supplier and had a look at the tread design of the Silent Armor and of the Wrangler AT/S and they’re not that different. Yes possibly the AT/S may be a bit more aggressive tread but that’ll also make them quite noisy on the road. When these AT/S come off of backorder (min one month), they’ll sell at the same price as the Silent Armor C rated tire; which the AT/S are as well (C rate). The Silent Armor also comes with an 80,000klm tread wear warrantee; the AT/S doesn’t. You didn’t say whether this truck is 2 or 4 wheel drive; if it’s a 2 wheel drive, it’s not going any further in the mud, then what the drive train can push it; regardless of the tire.  Dan."

I went from 20.2mpg to 14.39mpg overnight when switching my Tahoe from All Seasons to All Terrain (Toyo Open Country). Your mileage will vary (figuratively and literally) when switching to AT's depending on brand and tread design."
465305,Raf,2010-05-11 19:02:00,3495," absolutely.. mileage will vary with tires.  on my jeep, it sucked with no-seasons and it sucks with ATs but no noticeable difference in suckiness. if there is a difference, it's very small."
465306,SlowPoke,2010-05-11 19:07:00,2984," I wasn't keeping track of mileage with my Cherokee but I do remember the A/S to A/T switch being.... sobering. Then again, I added 5"" of suspension and 4"" of tire."
465307,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-11 19:08:00,10439,"  No need for load range E tires on your vehicle. I have been very impressed with the ice, snow traction of the Wrangler Silent Armors so far. They are also very quiet considering their agressive profile and gas mileage has not been impacted significantly since I switched from the all seasons that came with the vehicle."

I deal mostly in Goodyear; I do have lines on different tires, just maybe not as good a break on the other name brands. Like I said if you’re interested I’m here in town; give me a call or stop into the shop and we can do some phone shopping using my shops discount (whatever that might be) to see what’s out there and what we can get them for. You can have the tires at my cost and I’ll charge you $20.00 a wheel to mount & balance. That’s how I priced the Silent Armor earlier and I don’t care what brand of rubber you buy. Even if you do a cash & carry from another store; I’ll still mount them for you at that price.  Dan."

They seem to be highly rated on a few tire websites and reasonably priced. Need a new set of tires for my Ram 1500 and am not a big fan of Motomasters which seem to be one of the few others that are in my price range. Had bad luck in the past with buying used tires since they always seem to have cracked sidewalls after about a year.  Thanks  jjcanoe
