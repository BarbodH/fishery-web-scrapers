465959,lookinforwalleye,2010-05-13 14:53:00,4399,Wicked ride you have there JP so fast it blew your friggin hair off!!!  Enjoy!!!
465993,irishfield,2010-05-13 16:24:00,26272,HAHAHA..  ..and remember Seagulls can't get off the water and out of your way at that speed!! They'll get off the water.. but..
466073,anders,2010-05-13 19:05:00,1168, Hahaha  that would be funny to see a boat in a race with a seagull....i wonder what a seagull would look like at 80 mph
466074,anders,2010-05-13 19:07:00,1168," I will let someone else try it and let me know...that way i know to avoid...i guess thats why they sell helmets...  hahaha ""i drive the short bus to school""...thinking out loud..."
466080,Twocoda,2010-05-13 19:17:00,4130,11:08 - 80 MPH 11:09 - TOD in excess of 80 MPH  Your going to be able to catch some really fast fish with this rig....  Nice Ride!!!!!  to get my heart pumping im happy at 57 MPH...but i can achieve that also at 2.2 MPH...FISH ON!!!!!!
466118,JohnF,2010-05-13 20:12:00,3494, He's probably bolting on the trolling hardware as we speak.  Should get some exciting reaction bites at 80 mph - if only he can get the lure to sink and stay down.  JF
466119,misfish,2010-05-13 20:14:00,29133," Like GUMP would say,it,s a stinging rain,and yes it hurts.Thats why the have them fishface masks.  JP that was awesome bud. You had the perfect chop aswell.No calm water drag.  You becareful with that speed demon. Enjoy.      Oh ya,get a shave ya bum."
466292,edmichit,2010-05-14 01:57:00,145,"Umm, I'm gonna need a pretty long head start! I'll call you when i get to snake island."
466384,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-14 10:19:00,3761,Simply amazing JP. Let us know when that boat debuts on the show for the first time haha
465641,JPD,2010-05-12 18:18:00,296,"Alright, it's been a while but I finally have some pics and videos of the boat. I'll post the pics in order that Bass Cat sent them to me...   "

465657,JPD,2010-05-12 18:33:00,296,All in all it's been a great experience and a great bunch of people to deal with. Bay City Marine did a great job with the rigging yesterday for the Yamaha and I had a blast breaking it in and twisting her out! I'll update more as time goes on since I know there is more speed somewhere...lol
465658,SlowPoke,2010-05-12 18:34:00,2984,"Couldn't your farm equipment sponser come up with something nicer for a tow vehicle? Looking good JP, I bet you can't wait to spear a 15'er on Lake Erie to test it out!"

465664,Terry,2010-05-12 18:52:00,14456,man that's fast
465674,JohnF,2010-05-12 19:20:00,3494,Sweet! I was pulling for you when it kept bouncing off the .6 mark and then all of a sudden - POOF - 80 Nice.  JF
465675,anders,2010-05-12 19:32:00,1168,thats awesome...curious though...how does a bug or rain feel at 80?
465676,fish-miester,2010-05-12 19:34:00,864,
465685,GBW,2010-05-12 20:00:00,8460,I had to watch it a few more time and I think I wet myself!
465689,DanD,2010-05-12 20:12:00,2223,Maybe you should think of changing out the marker buoys from their storage area for a set of defibrillation paddles. 80mph on the water; would likely give me a heart attack and theyÂ’d be nice & handy there. LOL Nice boat; I can only dream.  Dan.
465693,SlowPoke,2010-05-12 20:28:00,2984, LMAO!!! I know I'd need them!
465710,JohnF,2010-05-12 21:27:00,3494, I know. I know. ------- really freakin' hard. It's a biker thang too. You haven't lived till you've tried to drive yer face thru a bee's arse at 80 mph.  JF
465721,Syn,2010-05-12 21:58:00,519,Wow wicked boat. Love how everything is laid out and all the little extra features that make it a dream ride.  thanks for the video tour JP.
465869,lew,2010-05-13 09:29:00,12766,"Incredible 1st run JP, I could almost feel that 80 MPH wind blast  coming thru my puter screen  My boat feels fast at 50 MPH, I can only imagine 80"
465888,NANUK,2010-05-13 11:12:00,797,"WOW!!!I have not seen a better thought/laid out & well made boat then this....WOW!!!!! and that Yamaha SHO, they don't call it ""The game changer"" for nothing. people have to get used to believing that its a 4 stroke. Congrats!!"
460463,fish-miester,2010-04-27 18:18:00,864,  haha very nice.. how much is the Triton up for ? and wheres she for sale?
460553,misfish,2010-04-27 22:39:00,29133,"  OFC Classifieds dude.  Looking real nice JP,and I have to aggree,wraps are cool looking,but the real look is much nicer.  Enjoying the process just as much as Milos."
462608,JPD,2010-05-03 20:56:00,296,"Well, after a few days without the net because of the move I got a bunch of pics and the boat is ready! Here are a couple shots showing the seats and finally the rig on the trailer.  "
462617,HTHM,2010-05-03 21:05:00,4082,They FORGOT the MOTOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lookin' good man!
462625,JPD,2010-05-03 21:28:00,296,The motor is going top be put on at Bay City Marine.. Clarence and Doug will be strapping on the big girl when I get the boat.. Yamaha 250 SHO..
462629,Roy,2010-05-03 21:36:00,13728,That's a beaut JP! What are the chunks of wood clamped to the fenders for? What's the clamp holding? And do they put the windscreens in at the dealership because they could be damaged in transit? I know nothing about that stuff.
462630,Leecher,2010-05-03 21:37:00,7832,Sweet ride JP Bet you can't wait for the maiden voyage and put a little slime on her!!!  Congrats Leechman
462636,danbouck,2010-05-03 21:58:00,4380,Look at those rims
462672,JPD,2010-05-03 23:50:00,296,"The clamps are holding down the checker plate that they installed. It's glue bonded onto the fenders. The clamps just make sure there is good adhesion. The windshields are off for that exact reason Roy. They really tighten down the shipping covers so they don't want to fracture them.  Thanks for the compliments guys.. I'm dying to drive her but I'm busy right now filming in the Keys... an no, I'm not complaining!"
462676,Terry,2010-05-03 23:56:00,14456,she is a thing of beauty
462684,Ron,2010-05-04 00:10:00,1683,"A sweet lookin ride JP!  The trailer alone looks sick with those rims!  I think I will but 10 tickets for the first ride in her. :D  Cheers, Ron..."
462690,Spiel,2010-05-04 00:37:00,9065," Sweet ride JP but I'll bet my last dollar Doug will be doing the work, not Clarence.   "
462696,GBW,2010-05-04 00:53:00,8460,"JP, did the folks at Overhaulin' get your trailer and pimp it out with some 20"" FOOSE wheels?!?!?!  Damn nice rig you have there JP."
462708,misfish,2010-05-04 01:14:00,29133," I would of thought Top gun, would of done that for you?  Nice looking ride JP."
462770,JPD,2010-05-04 03:55:00,296,I still use Paul as well Brian but the Yamaha has to be put on by a dealer... I still recommend both for repairs but rigging for the Yamaha for this rig will be done by Bay City. The rims are actually factory Bass Cat. They are by far the most customizable boats on the market.
462771,Cudz,2010-05-04 03:55:00,2652,That whole set up is SICK!!! I love the colours.  Too bad you have to wrap it.  Bling Bling   I hope that rig helps you from gettin schooled this summer.  lol
462774,fishnsled,2010-05-04 04:00:00,3520,That is just sick!  One of the nicest rigs I've seen.  Enjoy the ride!  Maybe a set of wheel locks are in order.
462776,GBW,2010-05-04 04:12:00,8460,"DANG!  FOOSE should look out then as those are NICE!  Can you pick from a bunch or is it part of the ""ideal look"" due to the boat type? Not that it matters to me (WAAAAYY to short on $ for it) but worth it for others.  TKS again JP."
462794,misfish,2010-05-04 10:24:00,29133,I forgot to say JP.Wrapping that beauty is going to be a shame.
462872,fish-miester,2010-05-04 14:40:00,864,beauty boat
462972,lookinforwalleye,2010-05-04 20:04:00,4399,"Nice lookin rig for sure but the wheels I don`t know about those, too each his own!!"
462984,solopaddler,2010-05-04 20:27:00,8605,Beauty boat. You and Miloman should team up.
462986,aniceguy,2010-05-04 20:33:00,1094,Beauty boat. You and Miloman should team up.   Naw Id end up gettin school'ed
463010,solopaddler,2010-05-04 21:39:00,8605, Probably. You don't even know how to quote someone properly.
463117,aniceguy,2010-05-05 01:53:00,1094,nope either my computer or the OFC site just dont like each other and the quote feature is unavaliable
458924,JPD,2010-04-23 05:19:00,296,"Since there was so much interest in Louis' post on the making of his new Bass Cat Pantera II I thought I would give everyone a better look at the manufacturing of a bass boat from the Bass Cat plant in Mountain Home, Arkansas. If some find this spammy I apologize but I find this stuff incredibly interesting as do others.  This series of pics will be of the production of my new boat. The start date was yesterday, April 21, 2010. I will get as many pics that are different than Louis' so you can see some of the behind the scenes manufacturing...  The first pic is the actual mold of the boat, no, it's not orange..lol That's the mold that they use to make the hull section. you can see the striping taped out and they have already sprayed the black bottom gel coat in. Bass boats are actually made inside out, the clear goes on first, then the gel with flake, then the glass is layed in. This is the very first step. Of course there is a releasing agent that is used on the mold to help them get the hull out once cured. "
458925,JPD,2010-04-23 05:24:00,296,"The next picture is of the cap being done. The clear coat is done and they are now spraying the gel, in this case it is Malibu Blue which is Black base with Blue metal flake. The raised sections are the lids for the livewells and the storage compartments which will be cut out afterward. The big two step box in the middle is the seat section and floor of the boat. The rod ramp runs along the side of the passenger seat (right side of pic) to hold his or her rods while not using them.  More to come as days progress...  JP "
458930,fish-miester,2010-04-23 07:22:00,864,ugh you guys make me want a boat !
458940,hirk,2010-04-23 10:40:00,571,Well what ya get JP? Puma?You be running a merc 250xs?Spill it man:)

458977,JPD,2010-04-23 13:41:00,296,"Thanks guys,  I'll be running a Puma FTD with the new Yamaha SHO 250 like Mike said. The speed is supposed to be unparalleled. This hull was tested with the 225 SHO and the 250 SHO when the motors were released in the fall last year. The 225 ran 75.1 mph with 3/4 fuel, 2 guys, batteries and safety equipment. Everything but tackle.  The 250 ran 79.6 mph with 2 guys, full fuel (52 Gallons), all the equipment except tackle. They ran it with the new Yamaha 27 pitch prop at 6000 rpms. Here's the data sheet from the press release for the 250 SHO / Puma FTD Combo.  JohnF, I know exactly what you are talking about... since I bought my first real boat that ran 28 mph I have been looking fir more and more speed. Never really got two-foot-itis since I love 19.5 - 20.5 foot boats for maneuverability.  More pics to follow.  JP "
458980,ecmilley,2010-04-23 13:47:00,2163,"Thanks for sharing, so.. where you taking me fishin? As much as i love these boats it's hard to give up the old ranger(maybe cause it's paid for, more likely that i don't have any money)"

459005,GBW,2010-04-23 15:35:00,8460,At that top speed I would want a parachute over top of my lifejacket and a helmet!
459058,Ron,2010-04-23 18:31:00,1683,"Oh man!  I gots an idea JP, you should have an exclusive contest to OFC members only. This could be a way to raise money for a charity of your choice. Make tickets @ 10.00 per ticket for a chance to win a days fishing in your new ride. Of course, it would be up to the winner to see if they want you in the boat with them!  Hey, on a side note, I finally saw one of your episodes on WFN, (I don't have satellite and spend my time fishing instead of watching. WFN is free for the rest of the month too) pretty informative. I liked it! Good on ya bud."

460400,fish-miester,2010-04-27 15:39:00,864,so you getting this one wrapped too ?! and what did ya do with your last boat ?
460439,JPD,2010-04-27 17:07:00,296, Those were the days Ed!  I just got a few more shots in... I have always cursed the fiberglass splinters when rigging my boats... seems it's not an issue here! Great finish quality. I have always maintained that cleanliness is next to Godliness when it comes to finishing boats... no splinters for this guy this year! Woohoo!  
460442,JPD,2010-04-27 17:10:00,296," This one will be going in for the wrap as well. It pains me very year since I love the colors that I pick and never really get to enjoy them. The Triton is for sale right now, hopefully she'll find a home with someone that will enjoy her as much as I did.  JP"
