463135,Nipfisher,2010-05-05 02:38:00,2449,I just checked out the Member Map feature at the top of the page. I noticed that a lot of board members have not added their location to the map. I just added mine. Take a minute to add your location. It is also a great tool to see which board members are in your area.

463288,grt1,2010-05-05 19:09:00,638,"Ok, I added my location a few weeks ago and it came up with a blue pin and when I look at the map today, everybody else has a pinkish coloured pin . my question is did I do something wrong when I added it or does it just mean i'm special? LOL"
