465475,Musky or Specks,2010-05-12 02:34:00,2710,"I use this jon on a lot of portage into lakes, great boat for it, easy for two guys to carry and very stable."
465478,irishfield,2010-05-12 02:42:00,26272,"These lads flew one all last summer...  With the number of unhappy tracker owners I've met, talked to and fixed boats for.. I'd probably pass unless it's the greatest deal since slice bread. "
465479,waterwolf,2010-05-12 02:45:00,556,stabilty is the quality i question most.i like fishing where most think it's too much effort to get to so a boat that can take a punch and handle some aukward situations is a definite candidate
465483,waterwolf,2010-05-12 03:09:00,556,"sorry to hear about all the problems guys are having with the larger trackers , especially the bad customer service that has followed.  this is why i'm asking about the jons, ,,i thought they are made from a different ,heavier gauge aluminum and are more rugged.  yes the price is quite worth some consideration even though there's some bad history on other boats."
465497,scugpg,2010-05-12 10:12:00,1373,"Check their weight capacity, last time I looked at a 10 or 12 jon it couldn't hold much weight (at least by the capacity rating).  2 average guys and it would be over limit, forget about a trolling motor etc."
465534,walleyemen,2010-05-12 13:12:00,316,"There has been problems with the jons , do a search on them from tracker marine, more so the grizzly i think. http://www.bassresource.com/bass_fishing_forums/YaBB.pl?num=1271292146"
465737,chris.brock,2010-05-12 22:48:00,4053,"I have a 12' Tracker jon boat from Bass Pro, it was cheap, it's very light ( I can portage it myself), the aluminum seems very thin (no leaks yet though), it rides very poorly in choppy water, goes great and fast in smooth water with just 8hp, very light in the front though, I'm happy with it so far, I take it easy on it when beaching it because it does seem fragile"
465752,Fish Farmer,2010-05-12 23:36:00,2234,"Reading other threads, I thought they changed there name to Cracker  After all what I've heard,read, I'd run the other way."
