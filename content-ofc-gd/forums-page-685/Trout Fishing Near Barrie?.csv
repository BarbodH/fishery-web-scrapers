465704,RustyShackleford,2010-05-12 21:13:00,15,I grew up in Orillia and recently bought a home in Barrie so I am pretty up to speed on Simcoe/Couchiching and lake fishing in general. I was wondering if within 45 minutes or so there is accessible Brook Trout or other river and stream species that are available. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
