465627,super dave,2010-05-12 17:38:00,323,I picked up a small trolling motor for my canoe last year but the problem is my canoe is not a flat back so I need to attach a motor mount.  anyone ever built one before?  I see them being sold online but it looks like most are attach on the inside wall of the canoe.  My canoe does not have a lip on the inside but on the outside.  Ideas anyone?
