Based on the story of the largest one-man bank fraud in Canadian history. Starring: Philip Seymour Hoffman, Minnie Driver, John Hurt Wednesday May 12 7-9pm  Many of my friends appeared in this Canadian made movie about a hard time gambler who actually lived in Burlington ON. I was asked to play a very, very small part in it but turned it down as I was on workers comp at the time. I missed my chance at fame LOL   Oh well, maybe in another lifetime  It is interesting to me personally anyway to see some of the people I knew that also worked(s) in the gaming business.  If you have some time to kill it may be worth watching."

He did did time and then was  hired by a firm to prevent it happening again. Good guy, good movie.   P.S. He lived in Pickering at the time. Still does."

I should have done it just for the experience alone. Not likely comp would have got wind of it anyway."
