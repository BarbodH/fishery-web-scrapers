465826,Terry,2010-05-13 01:49:00,14456,I was spending my time in the doldrums I was caught in the cauldron of hate I felt persecuted and paralyzed I thought that everything else would just wait While you are wasting your time on your enemies Engulfed in a fever of spite Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades Like shadows into the night  To martyr yourself to caution Is not going to help at all Because there'll be no safety in numbers When the Right One walks out of the door  Can you see your days blighted by darkness? Is it true you beat your fists on the floor? Stuck in a world of isolation While ivy grows over the door  So I open my door to my enemies And I ask could we wipe the slate clean But they tell me to please go damn myself You know you just can't win
