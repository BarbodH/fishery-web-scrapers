982388,grt1,2016-09-27 20:05:00,638,"my son put a lowrance 332 on my skiff but he said the gps doesn't work because the puck (external antenae) he has doesn't work, i was wondering if any one on this site has an old one they aren't using, i don't know what they are worth so if you have one, let me know how much you would like for it. maybe we can make a deal"
982390,Garnet,2016-09-27 20:27:00,2056,Fishermans Warehouse in Woodstock will have one.  His supply of old cables and such borders on hoarder.
982395,grt1,2016-09-27 22:14:00,638,"i tried to find a phone number for this and Canada 411 had no listing, neither did bell directory assistance, I cannot find a web site for it either, can you provide a number to call or a web page to go to"
982397,gaspumper,2016-09-27 23:03:00,393,"I have 2 that looks like this,the other one one I posted was for a complete working unit I would  get rid of one of these,sorry for the confusion and yes I do have the y cables also"
982415,grt1,2016-09-28 03:30:00,638,"i'll snap a pic of the back of the unit and post it, maybe you can tell by the pic if yours will work, it should be on the thread by tomorrow"
982416,grt1,2016-09-28 04:13:00,638,I googled the 332 unit and came up with a manual that shows the back of the unit and the puck they are saying that goes with the unit is a LGC2000 module antenna. it also looks like it is supposed to connect to a y adapter cable before it goes into the unit itself. do you have one of the cables that connects to the unit?
982421,limeyangler,2016-09-28 12:22:00,5204,"if this one is what you need its yours for free, I'm in Dryden so not far for you to come get it.  "
982430,TennesseeGuy,2016-09-28 15:03:00,957,There's a good chance I'll be coming through Dryden October 8 and will be able to pick up and deliver the puck right to Bill's front door.  Let me know.
982435,grt1,2016-09-28 16:58:00,638,"thanks for the offer Connie, Simon, I will check and see if my son still has his defective puck and see what it looks like if he has it. I will get back to you asap."
982437,gaspumper,2016-09-28 17:21:00,393,grt1 you have a pm.
982438,grt1,2016-09-28 17:25:00,638,this is the back of the unit so you can see the connection points  
982440,TennesseeGuy,2016-09-28 18:05:00,957,"Bill, I ran across information about GPS Module Compatibility.   It appears that the unit in Dryden will work with a Lowrance LMS-332 C  (sonar/gps).   PM your email address and I'll forward the complete information, but it may take a while as I'm going to be away from my computer for a while."
982441,TennesseeGuy,2016-09-28 18:11:00,957,"Wow, strange things are happening.  Somehow nasty words are substituted for two letters that are supposed to come after LMS-332 C  I made several attempts to change, but was unsuccessful.  I was unable to list the entire description of the Lowrance unit."
982455,limeyangler,2016-09-28 22:58:00,5204,"thanks for the offer Connie, Simon, I will check and see if my son still has his defective puck and see what it looks like if he has it. I will get back to you asap.    No problem"
982594,grt1,2016-09-30 23:59:00,638,"so today I went out and put a new battery in my skiff and fired up the depth finder / gps my son gave me. only one problem, it wouldn't turn on. I have power to the end of the power cord going into the unit but zip to turn it on. so I guess my son thought his problem was the puck when it really could have been the 332 unit itself.  so thanks to everyone for the advice and offers of help, I guess I will put an old depth finder I have in the basement on the boat and use it for the rest of the season"
