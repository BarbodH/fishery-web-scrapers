982621,captpierre,2016-10-01 16:45:00,2521,Great job. Y bones gone too And legal to store. Well done!
982622,Sinker,2016-10-01 16:56:00,8692,Nice job. Thats quite the knife he uses too.  S.
982623,Terry,2016-10-01 17:00:00,14456,"it sure is and he uses it just like any normal skinny  fillet knife , and he is even quicker when there isnt a camera shoved in his face"
982624,misfish,2016-10-01 17:05:00,29133,Nice knifemenship. I slice the same way now on bigger fish. I find it easier then filleting.
982634,Locnar,2016-10-01 20:13:00,645,"Right on! I'm booked for a full day with Lloyd on the 22nd, hopefully the bite is on!"
982636,Roe Bag,2016-10-01 20:23:00,246,He sure makes it look easy. I filet the same way. Probably takes me more than twice as long for each fish. Good job. Thanks for sharing the video.
982689,JoshS,2016-10-02 20:57:00,729,Nice technique and slick with those cheeks. Never seen anyone filet with a mini machete before...
982691,Terry,2016-10-02 21:08:00,14456,yeah he sure is good with it  I think he was a chef at Benihana restaurant lol
982692,manitoubass2,2016-10-02 21:09:00,11391,I've used a similar knife slabbing.  Not sure why nobody else has? It's similar to an electric blade.  Nice technique! Not my way but everyone has their own methods?  Ps. Mmmmmm walleye cheeks!!!!
982721,LeXXington,2016-10-03 01:54:00,1928,Great video Terry..
