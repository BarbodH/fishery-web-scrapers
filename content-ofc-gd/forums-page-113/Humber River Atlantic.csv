Makes me just remember and keep driving by, knowing back then, it was just that, back then.  My recollection was the summer of 71, summer job as a Forestry student at U of T, there was a bunch in the headwaters of the Pefferlaw River and Baltimore Creek that summer as well. Loved that summer."

982749,Jon,2016-10-03 17:05:00,209,"Craig's picture of the Brook Trout in the Humber spurred me to take a trip down last week to photograph the Chinooks and whatever else might be around. It has been a few years since I last went and I always enjoy a few hours down there to see the fish and the crowds. As it turns out, I also lucked out and managed to get a photo of an Atlantic Salmon jumping at one of the weirs.    I know this will probably turn into a debate about the program but I thought it was a post-worthy picture regardless.  Jon"
982750,Walshskie,2016-10-03 17:11:00,58,Wow that's like getting a picture of bigfoot.
982755,quickme,2016-10-03 18:19:00,261,great picture!!
982756,Mike Pike,2016-10-03 18:25:00,1332,"Hey, nice pic Jon!  Jumping salmon are cool, no matter which river they're on, but I'm always more in awe when they're in our more urban locations.  Very cool."
982768,Kerry,2016-10-03 21:06:00,383,Nice!! you can even see the spots on it too. Kerry
982769,misfish,2016-10-03 21:25:00,29133,Nice!! you can even see the spots on it too. Kerry  Yup. First thing I noticed. Great shot.
982773,BillM,2016-10-03 21:57:00,17367,"So that's the one that made it back?!?!?!       Non the less, great pic!"
982774,Steve,2016-10-03 22:00:00,2075,any idea what that fish cost tax payers?  great photo none the less!!!
982795,PUMP KNOWS,2016-10-04 02:22:00,937,Beauty!  Thanks for sharing
982830,ckewley,2016-10-04 14:53:00,699,Awesome shot man!
982831,JoshS,2016-10-04 15:28:00,729,Nice catch with the camera! The old humber is pumping out some gems... might have to go for a drift there lol.
982841,esoxansteel,2016-10-04 19:50:00,1307,"any idea what that fish cost tax payers?  great photo none the less!!!   Not near as much as the cancelled gas plants, e health or the ornge fiasco, and the saga continues with premeir square head, and trudeau, how much is trudeaus trips far and wide costing us, does he ever stay home and deal with issues in his own back yard, there are many  great pic of an Atlantic btw,"
982847,huzzsaba,2016-10-04 20:59:00,884,"so which one is the Atlantic? the top one or the bottom?  Pardon my ignorance  .  Nevermind, I think it's the bottom one.  The top one is very dark!"
982857,FloatnFly,2016-10-04 23:25:00,1640,almost thought for a second you caught 2 atlantics in the same pic (atlantics do get dark during the spawn aka black salmon) but the top one has spots on the tail
982858,Moosebunk,2016-10-04 23:49:00,3970,"Wow that's like getting a picture of bigfoot.  Some Corona went up nose.  Cool picture. Yes, a rare chance."
982885,craigdritchie,2016-10-05 13:28:00,1586,"Great pic, Jon ... and what a sight!  Brookies and Atlantics in the Humber ... pretty amazing, really.  If only there were more than one of each!"
982887,wkrp,2016-10-05 13:50:00,656,That is truly fantastic. When I  was a kid the only fish in the humber were suckers and lampreys.
982981,Jon,2016-10-06 13:17:00,209,Craig:  Thanks. I think your picture trumps mine - there are probably fewer Brook Trout in the lower Humber than Atlantics!  Jon
983167,Steve,2016-10-10 14:25:00,2075,don't be too sure of that.
983172,Rizzo,2016-10-10 16:03:00,4754,"as a kid I would fish the humber in the spring, and like someone already said, all I ever got were suckers and lamprey eels. Used to wade the river in my shorts and sneakers specifically targetting lampreys...found many many babies that met their demise."
983175,dave524,2016-10-10 16:32:00,4508,"Years ago did some woodlot survey work for the Dept of Lands and Forest, ( that's how long ago it was    ) There was a good population of brookies in the Humber upstream from Bolton at that time."

I can go as far back as that. There were some real fatties. Fished a stretch that ran through a kids camp for 3 years. Helpped to be one of the counslors. SP wrong. I got so many kids involved. They loved it. Not sure what it,s like now with the over populationing thing."
983182,porkpie,2016-10-10 19:07:00,2521,"If there where still brookies and Browns in the upper reaches of the Humber and tributaries, no one would talk about it on the internet."
