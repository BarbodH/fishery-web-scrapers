I'm saying the ice fishing outfitters shouldn't lose their businesses because of the walleye being more scarce when the reason they are scarce is because they get netted. What is the problem???"
982518,haze190,2016-09-29 21:28:00,21,Do you think that I was referring to the company selling the fish at the market that shouldn't suffer? I was referring to the outfitters.

982557,Pickeral eater,2016-09-30 13:05:00,155,Well haze nothing's ever a guarantee.  Let's not complain about the nfn netting or fish stocks if we're going to continue to support them by buying the netted fish.  AND it's medicinal!!!  Without it I could get even sicker! Lol.
982560,Jds63,2016-09-30 13:29:00,1365,Great suggestion  ?

Why should these businesses suffer because certain individuals are abusing our lakes? !!! Very disappointing.  to me it sounds like you are supporting the netting of fish because you are too lazy to go catch one yourself. You sir are part of the problem, the white man has an obligation to be responsible for our resources as well. This isnt a native exclusive problem."
982563,Sterling,2016-09-30 13:39:00,477,"Just a note about buying walleye; even if all local residents stopped buying, the demand would still exist. I've seen Nipissing walleye on menus in Hamilton.

I catch several pickerel myself every year so catching is not the problem. I am certainly supporting it by buying it- I didnt know before this thread there was a problem with the volume in Nippissing.  I watched certain people (who are permitted) stand at a fish sanctuary in Algonquin park (east side whitney) and pound the pickerel one after another when it was so easy my 7 year would have had his limit. I will never support this kind of activity because it simply isn't right.  For the record I agree that we all have an obligation which is why I follow the rules."

That's a bit parabolic. What I'm saying is that - although it will help - discouraging the local purchase of walleye won't solve our problem. The entirety of Nipissing's walleye supply could be met by southern demand, no problem. Sad but true.  Meanwhile I'm going into my 200th walleye on Nipissing without keeping a single one. I never buy walleye, Nipissing, Erie or anywhere. I now fish barbless. I don't fish deep in the winter in order to avoid barotrauma.  Believe me my friend, I'm not careless about the issue, in fact I'm borderline obsessed with restoring the lake."

982575,JoePa,2016-09-30 15:58:00,179,Well all I know is that I use to go to Nip a couple times a year - stay at a campground and spend money in that area - now I don't go there anymore -
982580,jimmer,2016-09-30 19:36:00,2730,"Love my annual trip to nip, been going for the last 10 yrs for a week with an outfitter. Yes the fishing has declined over the last 5 yrs that I have noticed. Many of you probably can say been longer than that, BUT last years walleye fishing was much better imo, no doubt due to stricter regulations. Not a lot of keepers but good sized fish that will be even better this year. Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't closing walleye on rice lake for a few yrs work for the fishery? Seems like rice is doing a lot better these days. Is this an issue because nfn is requesting this? I love nip and am looking forward to my January trip and I do feel for those who make a living from the industry, but I won't be totally upset if I have to head some place else this winter. I don't ever remember them closing walleye on Rice Lake.  They initiated slots and reduced the limit. They shut the walleye fishery down on Lake Scugog last winter.  The continued ice fishing on Nipissing is a problem because of the size restriction and the number of walleye caught from water over 30' deep that have to be released.  They probably die. Our group had gone there for many many years, but no longer go.  We haven't seen the operators adjust by moving their huts to better pike and perch grounds."
982581,Sterling,2016-09-30 19:47:00,477," Correct. The MNR and NFN claim 20% mortality via ice fishing - that means I've killed 40 walleye with catch and release? Totally defeats the purpose.  Some innovative regulations are needed, but the public doesn't seem willing to budge.  Personally I'd go for something wild like 1 fish limit, no releasing except for spawners. Barbless only and no fishing deeper than 25ft through ice. The aurora trout population is protected in a similar way - you catch a fish, release or not, you're done.  Who here is willing to go this far? The lake has cancer, it needs major surgery, not aspirin.  Edit: I'm actually curious as to what other innovative regulations we could utilize. Anyone else have ideas?"
982718,Nipfisher,2016-10-03 01:07:00,2449,If the close walleye on Nip for winter fishing but promote catching perch and Pike there will be less anglers but still many walleye caught (and released). Its not like the soft-water where you can target pike. Drill a hole and drop your line. Good chance you can locate schools of perch but walleye and pike will be there too.  1 fish limit would kill the tourist industry. Keep it 2 fish of any size and no releasing. Catch 2 walleye and you are done for the day.
982103,bobowski,2016-09-23 15:49:00,360,https://www.baytoday.ca/local-news/stakeholders-fear-ice-fishing-will-disappear-on-lake-nipissing-412943  I don't know what i think of this. Do you think they will shut it down? Was going to plan a Nipissing trip this winter but now i am second guessing.
982104,wkrp,2016-09-23 16:08:00,656,Its more viable for  the government to have a viable stocking programme and for petes sake  stop all netting on this lake. I am sure tourist dollars are a greater source of revenue than the netting which has devastated the walleye stocks
982105,AKRISONER,2016-09-23 16:18:00,5558,"lol, ice fisherman kill 20% of fish they catch and release?(hard to believe) yet netting kills 100% of the fish caught...but the band is still blaming the ice fisherman...mind blowing."
982106,Headhunter,2016-09-23 16:22:00,5703,"Maybe it's time the NFN to consider not netting the lake and taking advantage of their location and resources to open a resort/casino on Nip. To my mind, everyone wins, except those addicted to gambling! Shortsightedness has left the pickereye population devastated, which will trickle down to the wallets of everyone in the area. Resorts/casino's seem to be thriving elsewhere in the province, so why not the Nip region. HH  PS - here we go again! I've got the popcorn maker out and await the usual results of threads like this!"
982116,Joeytier,2016-09-23 18:09:00,3990,"http://www.anishinaabe.ca/index.php/2016/09/11/its-time-to-speak-up-for-our-lake-the-nbisiing-fishery-our-rights-from-its-biggest-threat/  Something to chew on.  Illegal netting is illegal netting, no matter who is doing it.  The lake was just fine before it was colonized.  The fact that illegal netters can make profit means that there is a market for it on the first place.  Treaty rights do not bend at our will, they are the law of the land just like our Constitution.  Meanwhile the OFAH will fight any and all measures suggested to help out the lake.  I don't believe the lake is in the dire straits that some people seem to suggest, as any competent walleye angler that spends time out there will catch a ton of fish, and there are two very strong year classes just now reaching sexual maturity, so if we can a few good recruitment years from those fish, that will be a huge help.  Stocking is not the answer.  Walleye should not exist on a put and take basis, seems really silly to me to be suggesting that, since Nipissing is a walleye factory and shouldn't require supplementation if managed properly."
982118,Joeytier,2016-09-23 18:15:00,3990,"Not to mention, just about every walleye fishery in central/northeastern Ontario is a very far cry from where it was even 20 years ago due to angling pressure, without the help of nets, yet that fact seems to be ignored by everyone.  It's not as though everything else in the area hasn't been hit just as hard if not harder..."

Nipissing First Nations stopped netting a year ago...old news, now who to blame?  http://www.nugget.ca/2015/08/18/new-chief-pulls-plug-on-walleye-nets"
982120,Sterling,2016-09-23 18:35:00,477,"Agree with Joey.  Some points to consider;  1. Any effort into outlawing the nets is a wasted effort unless it comes from Nipissing First Nations (NFN) themselves. This stuff has been to the supreme court and back. 2. NFN is making headway with understanding the effect of their netting and the new chief (Scott McLeod) is doing a great job so far implementing measures to at least attempt a reduction in netting. 3. On the flipside, NFN has had failures with their own implementation of a moratorium. In 2015, 19700 walleye were netted over 13 days (IIRC), during their own self-imposed moratorium. We saw this again in 2016. There is no legal recourse to stop this. 4. The only realistic approach to ""stopping the nets"" is subsidizing the netters directly. If you think about it, this is a cheap solution. 5. I would like to see some measures put in place to reduce fish mortality. Walleye rarely survive when retrieved from 35ft+ of water. It may sound silly but I say ban fishing in waters 30ft+ in depth. 6. Everyone should go barbless. 7. The wasted fish due to by-catch is a moral crime. NFN should be obligated to give away by-catch.  Now let me go get my popcorn and flame-retardant suit."

That article provides some fantastic insight from a lot of elders that make very very solid points, it becomes very obvious the type of people who feel that they have a right to illegally net still ""the chief is the chief, hes not a judge""...but if a judge told you to stop youd say hes violating your rites as well..what way do these guys want to have it?  this post makes no sense unless you read the article and comments FYI"
982135,wkrp,2016-09-23 21:50:00,656,The netting has spread down to the French river As soon as the majority of the tourists and anglers leave  out come the nets . A fish caught in a net is only generates  income of what it is worth buy the pound  but a fish caught by an angler is worth five if not  tenfold . Dont get me wrong I am very sympathetic to the First Nations but the government has to realize that bandaids do not work when major surgery is required. A progressive solution must be  found  . Perhaps buying the quotas on an annual basis and stricter enforcement of illegal netting y the First Nations and the MNR.

In the Non FN community the noncooperative get charged and tried in a court.  Can we really allow FN individuals to do what ever they want?  Can't the FN community ask for the charging of such individuals? What do they do if the individual decides that drinking and driving is OK on Rez?
