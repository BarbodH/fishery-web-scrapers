983093,Tom McCutcheon,2016-10-08 13:17:00,627,I am so glad to hear this. I felt the pain of both Shawn and James. Now comes the two year court battle.
983124,Rizzo,2016-10-09 13:26:00,4754,"With the value put on those antlers I would rather have the insurance money than the antlers back! ""We found your antlers""....that would be the worst news I could hear!"
983125,leaf4,2016-10-09 13:52:00,2466,"The ""value"" they placed on them wouldn't be recovered from what I read so it's a good thing they did get them back, happy for a good ending, all the ""inside job"" people can take off their foil hats now haha"
979607,DRIFTER_016,2016-08-15 23:18:00,10439,"Why would anyone want to steal taxidermy, I would think that its virtually worthless aside from the person whose trophy it is.  There's a pretty extensive black market for trophy antlers. Record book heads go for 10's of thousands of $$$ US."
979609,misfish,2016-08-15 23:18:00,29133,"I'll believe that when the insurance settles up & they send all the customers who's antlers were taken a full refund for deposites + full refunds for their hunting trips which got the antlers. A little to hard to believe if you ask me. And I'm positive an insurance adjuster will think the same.   I believe they will refund the costs of the mounts. The cost of thier adventures, I dont see that.  These guys have recieved many  high awards for thier works.World wide from what I have read. They are a brand name out there for thier work. I dont (Damn I hope not) think they are part of an insurance job.  Edit to add  I had a mount made . When it was done, I was asked before even taking it out of the shop, if I would be willing to sell it for much more then I paid to have it mounted. The thought never crossed my mind. It was my first buck and there was no way. So there is a market for them."

979623,Woodsman,2016-08-16 00:04:00,1286,Shops may be allowed to attempt to recover losses of mounts they didn't get paid for in full but they better have paperwork to back this up.

I dont plan on having any mounts done, by anyone.  This was a one time deal for me. First buck.Big 9 pointer Had  two fish mounts done many years ago, by a guy that worked from home. They turned out great. I gave them to a buddy that has a great man cave. Way before man cave was a thing.LOL"
979632,DRIFTER_016,2016-08-16 00:31:00,10439,"   Where does BPS and Cabelas get thier 1000,s of mounts?  BPS get their mounts by hunting them. Johnny Morris and his crew came up to Great Bear to hint Caribou and Muskox one year. They had 24 in their crew and came to Yellowknife on Johnny's jet. They had all animals dressed out for full body mounts."
979647,Steve,2016-08-16 02:09:00,2075,I never said AT wasn't the best at what they do...they are!! But a world class operation doesn't keep irreplaceable items in a trailer.  No Insurance company is springing for the owners of the stolen antlers to go on world class hunting trips to replace them.....
979651,ONbuckhunter,2016-08-16 02:28:00,39,I feel bad for the clients that lost their trophies.  You cannot put a price on a trophy.  Im not sure what I would do if I had one my headmounts or trophies stolen.  I really hope these idiots are caught or better yet are recipients of an Darwin award.
979676,jimmer,2016-08-16 13:25:00,2730,"The sale of items is a gray area.  I have bought capes from out of province which are then mounted and able to be sold (with proper receipts). You are unable to sell migratory birds, mounted game fish or Ontario game animals if you live here.  Reproductions are a completely different story, since they aren't actually the fish. However, all rules are out on the black market.  They can be a hot item south of the border. I would be surprised if Shawn and James were involved in an insurance scam.  Only they know if they have purchased the right coverage for lost/damaged customer items."
980306,James77,2016-08-24 02:01:00,175,"Caledon Enterprise Shawn Galea and James McGregor have owned and operated Caledon’s Advanced Taxidermy for decades and now, after a devastating robbery last Friday (Aug. 12), believe they may lose the business that they started more than 30 years ago. The pair spent that Friday, as well as the two days leading up to it carefully preparing and loading a trailer full of 69 sets of moose, elk and stag antlers that were to be shipped to another facility for the next stage of the taxidermy process. What they were preparing to do was bleach, clean and disinfect the skulls of the animals attached to the antlers, which is usually done off property due to a lack of space. “We are seeing people wondering why we were storing this stuff outside, but if it takes you three days to load a trailer – what do you do in between?” Galea continued. “What you do is you barricade it, you block it off. You back it up against your building so the back door can’t be opened, you park it next to a shipping container so the side door can’t be opened. You hook it up to the truck and put another trailer in front of it – that’s what you do.” But, despite all necessary security and safety precautions, somehow, someone managed to get into the secured area and take off with a pick-up truck, the trailer containing the antlers, and a second trailer with two all terrain vehicles (ATVs) inside. The ATV's, Galea says, was the only thing that his disabled son was able to use independently. Galea and McGregor estimate the loss to be about $1.5 million – a figure which has come under much scrutiny since being released. According to the business owners, given that many of the hunters travel from international locations to northern Canada and Alaska to go on the adventure that eventually ends in a kill - there are a lot of costs incurred before those antlers get to Advanced Taxidermy. “The cost is in the hunt. To go hunt an Alaskan moose or a Yukon moose and fly all the way from Belgium, France or Germany to the United States or Canada, to get to that destination and harvest an animal of that magnitude and that size, to have an outfitter guide you through those mountains to get that animal back to us would be closer to $30,000 US,” said Galea. “For me to be able to replace that, I would have to pay him to recreate that entire experience again. It’s like someone telling you to just have your wedding day all over again if the photos go missing. It’s just not the same.” The antlers themselves are worth next to nothing because there are steep restrictions when it comes to selling or moving wildlife of any kind. According to Jolanta Kowalski, Sr. Media Relations Officer for the Ministry of Natural Resources, fines for selling such items can be as much as $100,000 and two years imprisonment as they are commercial offences. “These guys think that they are sitting on a gold mine. If it was that easy to sell them, I’d be selling stuff like that all the time,” said Galea. “For us to ship a client their elk – we have like 20 hours invested in paperwork to be able to transport that across the border or from province to province. It is a huge process. You can’t just sell them or take them anywhere.” Galea and McGregor are reaching out to the community to keep an eye out for all of the missing items. “We need people to look in their barns and look in their sheds and look in trailers, look behind the field in the back bush, we need people to look around and see if this trailer turns up. The trailer has not come up. This is our livelihood.”"
980322,Tom McCutcheon,2016-08-24 12:36:00,627,Thanks for posting that James.  Perhaps some of the negative comments can be put to rest.
980324,Terry,2016-08-24 12:43:00,14456,I never thought they had anything to do with it Now they say the antlers were not even finished   What the heck would the thieves want with antlers that are not mounted or complete.  They didn't steal it for the trailer. The thieves took the atvs out of the other trailer and left the trailer on the side of the road.  Strange thief.
980330,Steve,2016-08-24 13:39:00,2075,"GPS tracking system on the truck? Doesn't appear to have. Amazing what removing a battery from the truck will do to prevent theft.  Security on the site? Guess not.  Most likely an inside job. Upset employee (by far most likely scenario)? Competitor wanting to take out the best (which AT is)?  ""IF"" they continue I bet they hire a risk manager (or if they have one, I hope they fired 'em).  The ATV's will be replaced without question.  As I said earlier in this thread, no insurance will pay for the trips to hunt and recapture.  I hope this also serves as an eye opener for other businesses that operate in ""priceless"" goods."
980332,AKRISONER,2016-08-24 13:57:00,5558,i would expect Advanced Taxadermy to be sued by those that lost their trophies. That's where the real pain is going to be felt.
980337,DanD,2016-08-24 15:20:00,2223,"  Hire a rent a cop to baby sit the trailer for the three nights; that there was product in the trailer. Hide the trailer somewhere at night, rather than leaving it behind your place of business. Rent a self storage cubical large enough to fit the trailer in. Yes extra work and cost; but they'd still have their client's property. I'm sorry but I think they got complacent; thinking good enough to keep the trailer safe.  Dan."
980355,Steve,2016-08-24 21:35:00,2075,you are correct Dan.

979465,Tom McCutcheon,2016-08-14 17:06:00,627,"WOW.... I would expect that these will find their way into somebodies man cave, and that person/s will make up some lies about how he/they took them down.  I am sure the boys are insured for this, but my question is ""how does insurance cover a trophy set of antlers for the hunter who bagged them?"""
979487,woodenboater,2016-08-14 19:20:00,2277,"sounds like the thieves knew what they were doing and what the shop had, stealing random trailers is a roll of the dice. no idea where they'll fence the antlers and other wildlife. atvs however...long gone  hope advance had cameras outside recording it all"

979502,Terry,2016-08-14 23:18:00,14456,each set of  antlers were set in a solid gold brick  lol who knows
979503,Rizzo,2016-08-15 00:27:00,4754,"insurance claim? yup...$21,000 per set"
979504,Woodsman,2016-08-15 00:30:00,1286,In Ontario the antlers legally have no monetary value is they are illegal to sell. The value stated in the article might be the lost taxidermy costs that would have been charged for the mounts.
979505,Terry,2016-08-15 00:35:00,14456,"of course, but it still breaks down to $21,000 per set to get a set of antlers done"
979506,buick14,2016-08-15 00:46:00,741,I'm glad a few others piped in here before I had the guts to.....21k/ per sounds a little high id say

979521,DanD,2016-08-15 10:24:00,2223,I'm sorry here; but who in their right mind would store all those antlers in a trailer; unless they wanted the antlers to disappear?  Dan.
979525,Terry,2016-08-15 12:00:00,14456,I don't know what happened so I  will not accuse them of anything  It's not my place to say But the value. In my opinion seems high .. And that might be why I have never got antlers done before
979526,GbayGiant,2016-08-15 12:26:00,1780,I'm sorry here; but who in their right mind would store all those antlers in a trailer; unless they wanted the antlers to disappear?  Dan.

979536,jimmer,2016-08-15 14:40:00,2730,"21 K probably is to cover the cost of their customers trip to wherever they hunted the animal.  You just can't replace a set of antlers.  When I was a taxidermist, this is what nightmares are made of.  Imagine having to make the call to a customer and tell them their trophy is gone."

It is embarrasing that they would keep unreplacable items in a trailer.You can't even imagine what their profit margin is....its massive!

979545,DropShot'r,2016-08-15 15:33:00,62,I love the comments.  Especially from those that live a hundred+ km away but seem to know what happened and pass judgement.....
979546,Tom McCutcheon,2016-08-15 15:47:00,627,"Shawn and James of Advanced,  are two of the very best in the world at what they do.  They charge as much as they do because of that. When a client spends upwards of 50 to 75 thousand US dollars to travel to far away lands for a controlled trophy hunt, they don't want Billy Bob from Skeeter's Taxidermy doing the mount.  I don't agree with the idea of trophy hunting, but it is allowed, and most of the operators are legal and obey the laws of the land.  Just my opinion, so don't  shoot me and hang me on the wall...... LOL"
979571,jimmer,2016-08-15 18:43:00,2730,"Further to Tom's comments.  Most taxidermists are underpaid and we (past life) all wished we could charge what Advanced charges. That's how you take it out of the basement and make a living at it.  Many people think it's a hobby and should have their mounts done for next to nothing.  It's a serious art form that many can't do, so those that are good at it should be compensated properly."
979599,Woodsman,2016-08-15 21:51:00,1286,A little to hard to believe if you ask me. And I'm positive an insurance adjuster will think the same.
