983156,crappieperchhunter,2016-10-10 01:23:00,2582,They will become your best friends if you feed them Brian. I had one in Caygeon that I fed small bluegills to while I was fishing for them. I had a small gill  slip out of my hands once and it hit a rock on the way down and floated away dead on the top of the water. A Heron flew over and grabbed it about 10 feet away from me and that was the beginning of a 3-4 summer friendship.I would go to my shore spot and as soon as it saw me it would come over and stand right beside me...I could have patted it. He/she never showed up this year....so I spent the whole summer looking for my fishing buddy.  Sure was fun having a feathered friend to fish with.
