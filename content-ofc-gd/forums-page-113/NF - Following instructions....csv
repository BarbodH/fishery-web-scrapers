She says to him, ""Buy a quart of milk and if they have avocados get six."" When he returns he puts 6 quarts of milk on the table. The wife then asks him ""why did you buy 6 quarts of milk?"" To which the man replies, ""they had avocados!"""

I don't know how many extra holes I have drilled to build those things properly.  When my uncle was a kid my Mom who had just moved from western NY to Hamilton sent him to the store when he was visiting her and Dad and told him to buy 100 napkins. He came home with 100 feminine napkins. She didn't know what a serviette was either."
