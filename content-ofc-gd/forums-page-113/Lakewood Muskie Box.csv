982866,KraTToR,2016-10-05 00:47:00,506,Does anyone know where I can buy a Lakewood Muskie tackle box around the GTA?  Not GTA but Cabela's used to carry it but sold out.  The other is Pro Tackle in Belleville.  Unless someone on here knows of a used one for sale ??!!?? Medium or Monster model..:-D  Thanks in advance!

982900,landry,2016-10-05 17:06:00,1005,We used to have them. They were too big for boats under 18 as stated. I have heard the new ones can react with soft plastics so do your homework before u buy.
982903,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-05 17:52:00,8243,"I recommend the ""Tackle Mate"" box. I use the smaller version to store all my Walleye plugs and spoons. The larger box is made for those bricks you guys toss for Musky. $89.99 at Bills Bait or Fishing World in Hamilton. I got mine ordered in from Bill's Bait. Great boxes, sturdy and simple. tacklemate.com."
982928,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2016-10-05 22:56:00,535,Yeah I had soft plastics melt holes right through the sides. I now keep my soft plastics in plastic tackle boxes.
982931,landry,2016-10-05 23:05:00,1005,How can a musky box not handle soft plastics. That's sad. I say make one or two out of a milk crate and plastic downspout for almost nothing. Big round pipe fits pounders and rectangular holds everything else. Put a plastic sheet on. Bottom to keep the tails from poking out and getting ripped off.
