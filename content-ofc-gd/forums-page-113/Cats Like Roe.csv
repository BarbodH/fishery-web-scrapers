Off to the vet and the x-rays showed the hook and 3 sinkers on the line, in the picture of her stomach.  A $ 2600.00  operation  later and the hook and sinkers were removed.   Now when I stream fish I have to scout around and pick up all the crap left behind by other fisherpeople before I release the dog."

No way could anyone get near her to even see it. I cringe still today at the sound the poor puppy made.  Off to the emerg Vets, $$$$$$. Someone left the treble hook in the grass for someone to find. Usually that someone is a child or pet. Please clean up after ourselves."
