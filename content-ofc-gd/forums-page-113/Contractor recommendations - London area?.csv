982616,scugpg,2016-10-01 16:00:00,1373,Wondering if anyone has any suggestions for a recommended contractor in the area. I have a couple projects I'm thinking of doing down the road. If you have someone to recommend please let me know or shoot me a PM.  Thank you.

982933,scugpg,2016-10-05 23:14:00,1373,Thanks I will look him up. Anyone else have a recommended suggestion?  Thanks!
982937,Woodsman,2016-10-05 23:32:00,1286,Maybe posting the planned projects may help out. Some contractors are better at certain things for example an outside deck compared to a new basement washroom.
982938,scugpg,2016-10-05 23:45:00,1373,Bathroom and eavestrough/soffit.
982971,Woodsman,2016-10-06 07:42:00,1286,Those jobs require completely different skill sets & equipment. Better off with 2 different contractors.
