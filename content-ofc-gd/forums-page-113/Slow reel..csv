I try it and find it slow to retrieve. Turns out it is a 1:4 ratio reel. My Symmetries are 1:6.2, I believe. Can't take it back now. I'm thinking I could make use of a slow retrieve reel for the walleye fishing I do. Where do y'all think it would work best? Jigging?  Not sure about drop shotting or rip jigging. I have a tendency to retrieve too quickly anyway. This may be a good thing. I hope."

Line recovery per handle turn varies, more so when you go between spinning and casting reel.  I used old Abu baitcasters (1960's) with a  3 something retrieve, not the best suited for smallie fishing at the time, you had trouble cranking fast enough when they were coming up, never had that problem with the same era Mitchell 300 spinning reel.  Walleye aren't known for blazing runs, like steelhead or salmon? A faster retrieve helps when using some surface lures, just my view it isn't always needed."

982639,206,2016-10-01 21:27:00,563,Shimano web site only one option for the 2500 5.0:1
982990,captpierre,2016-10-06 16:43:00,2521,Just got back to the lake. Had another look at the reel box. You are right 5:1. Sorry my bad.  4 ball bearings. Can sure notice a difference with the 6.2:1 reels. Feels good though.
