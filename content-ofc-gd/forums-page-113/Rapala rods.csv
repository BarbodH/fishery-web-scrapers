982451,captpierre,2016-09-28 21:45:00,2521,"Picked up a Rapala ""Walleye"" rod. LeBaron sale. I heard that they weren't that good initially. Have they improved? Will use it for jigging/drop shotting. 6ft 10 in. $88 - 20% off"
982454,manitoubass2,2016-09-28 22:30:00,11391,"You'll find out soon hahahaha!  I'd imagine it's just like everything else ya pay for.  My higher end st. Croix rods are amazing, same with my shimano rods, but two of my staples are a Berkley lightening rod that was maybe $50 and a Shakespeare rod from Walmart that I think was even cheaper???"
982459,mike rousseau,2016-09-28 23:53:00,4661,I used to have some  Great rods till I did something stupid and broke em
982465,tizfun,2016-09-29 02:48:00,292,"Good score.. I have 3 Rapala rods..  a 7'3' shift and 2 7' R-Type matched with the Rapala reels... Love them, use them every outing..  I bought 4 St. Croix rods and paired them with Quantum Accurist  AC25 PTIA reels 2 of which are the KVD series earlier this summer.  Wife loves hers, she uses them all the time.. Mine sit in the boat.. I think I've thrown them 2-3 times this year... Don't get me wrong.. They are super rods and paired nicely, but there's something that just gets me using my Rapala's all the time..  Tiz"
982466,Dutch01,2016-09-29 03:11:00,1431,"I have a 7' Rapala Magnum that I like more than I thought I would.  It has held up well so far, I would definitely buy another."

I have not used one (rapala rod) but I find my mid grade line of rods cast and play fish just as well as my better rods. In my mid grade line or rod's I have only broken one due to MY fault so enjoy the new rod.  It comes down to the reel and line that I use with said rod that makes me confidant with a sub $100 rod.  Oh and I'm cheep too...  LOL"
982471,Joeytier,2016-09-29 12:02:00,3990,"Those walleye rods are quite nice.  Just make sure you stay away from their Shift reels, I have two and they are unbelievably poor quality for their price range.  I'm talking outrageously crappy here..."
982483,AKRISONER,2016-09-29 14:16:00,5558,"the magnum series of rods is literally the best value I have ever found. I personally go higher end, but for anyone looking for a >100 rod I would recommend the magnum every single time."
982492,captpierre,2016-09-29 19:26:00,2521,Also picked up a reel for it. Wanted another Shimano Symmetre. Rep said they were discontinued and replaced with NASCI model. Hope it's as good.  Don't like the gold on it but seems solid. Anybody have a NASCI?
982499,Sinker,2016-09-29 20:19:00,8692,"All my rods are cheap, but I use good reels. The reel is the key anyways. I rarely break a rod, and when I do its an expensive one....of course. I have two shimano clarus rods at shimano right now being replaced under warranty...lol.  I can't even remember what kind of rod I use most of the time, but its an off brand....maybe abu...I dunno,but it works great and I like it. My GF uses a Rapala magnum musky rod, and so far so good. Also have another rapala that my son loves....works fine, but they all have good reels.  Its not the rod that catches the fish, its the guy/girl operating it!  S.  S."
982544,msp,2016-09-30 00:46:00,1336,I have a 7 ft 1 rapala r type rod. Got it for free and absolutely love it. I have been using it for about 6 years without any issues . The only thing I'm not fond of is the foam grip. Just personal preference
983012,buick14,2016-10-06 21:03:00,741,A rapala concept ti Rod is incredible...I had a shift and r type they were good rods for sure no complaints
