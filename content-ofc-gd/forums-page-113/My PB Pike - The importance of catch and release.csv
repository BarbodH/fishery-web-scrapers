Well it turns out that it was the same fish I had caught 2 years prior.  Here's a cool video of the experience showcasing the importance of catch and release.  I still made some handling errors, my net is too small etc.  But doing your best to preserve the life of trophy fish goes a long way, and you CAN catch that fish again!!! Enjoy."

I have no science on the matter. I would imagine that early in their lives, they grow much faster until they reach a MAX point of some sort.  Either way, 1/2 inch in 2 years shows how fragile a population of large fish could be, and emphasizes the need for catch and release of trophy fish."
