Sterling, I'm not at all familiar with that end of the lake but I do know that they've already began their fall drawdown of the lake and it's came down a fair amount from summer levels. They do this prior to the lake trout spawn now so they dont leave their eggs high and dry like they used to. You may want to call whoever you're renting from and make sure their dock is still usable. Thank you:)"

982577,jimmer,2016-09-30 17:24:00,2730,I had a neighbour from Timmins and he swore by Horwood for walleye.  He went a couple times a year and always caught fish.  You should still check out Mike's Outfitter which is located this side of Rouyn Noranda.
982579,adempsey,2016-09-30 18:15:00,1498,Still looking! Rental on Kipawa fell through. No follow up from owner . There are at least 12 outfitters on that lake.

Our best fishing mostly always came at/after dusk, specially for better size as it got later. Can't see fall being any different, except maybe shallower.  Sterling I would suggest you go to http://kipawafishingforum.net/index.php and pose your questions there. For sure there should be someone there who would know about outfitters that would still be open and likely not offer a hunting package.  Cheers"
982611,T-Bone,2016-10-01 12:36:00,160,"Well...if that's doing very well I'd stay home.  Sterling we've fished Kipawa mainly late summer for 17 years. This year we caught over 1,200 walleye in six days...so the fish are there. Not sure where you can get a cabin this time of year but the SE end of the lake is off the charts crazy good. Have to know what you're doing as it can be challenging, but when they're on the bite it gets silly.  Good luck..."

I'm doing a ton of research and drafting a plan of attack which I will run by the OFC committee when ready. I imagine the problem at that time will be a potential lake turnover.  Even considered booking a guide on day 1 to get a head start. Joey do you know of anyone reliable in the area?  Bottom line is that if the wife doesn't catch any eyes, I might as well just stay at the cabin this winter!!!"
