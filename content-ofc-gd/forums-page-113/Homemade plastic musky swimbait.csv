982547,BlueEye,2016-09-30 01:30:00,338,Nice bait Landry!  I'm an avid musky angler myself - it's a sickness for sure.  Keep up the good work!
982550,Tom S,2016-09-30 10:20:00,362,I think you would be ok without looping back around. Do you do any prep to the wire before casting so that the lead can bond to it? If not maybe think about it as a strong bond will make it much much stronger than just being embedded in lead.
982582,mike rousseau,2016-09-30 20:24:00,4661,I'm excited to see the end product
982599,landry,2016-10-01 01:58:00,1005,"Thanks for the tips and compliments guys I will post a video and pics when all done.  It's an evolution right now - tedious step by step kinda thing. In the end I am hoping to airbrush and dip them but that's not until late fall. For now, I wanna take a half dozen prototypes and see if they hold up and catch fish:) they look great in the water."
982600,landry,2016-10-01 01:59:00,1005,How would I prep the wire for the lead??? To bond it better?
982601,outllaw,2016-10-01 02:38:00,1232,"no prep. just make sure leads very hot. with the diagram shown,it will never move..we pour every day."
982604,landry,2016-10-01 03:18:00,1005,Thanks outlaw. What temp do u pour your lead at? I just got a Lee Pot IV and I was assuming that 7 meant 700 degrees??
982641,outllaw,2016-10-01 21:53:00,1232,"clean plumbers lead melts fast. scoop the slag off. we use propane tocrh,s and ladles. your system is awesome. just remember,with the lee pots and others clean lead or clogs will come.my friend pours 5000lbs a season. that his greatest problem. tire weights suck lol.. your project looks sweet.."
982654,landry,2016-10-02 01:30:00,1005,Awesome info. Thanks
982854,landry,2016-10-04 22:25:00,1005,I have pretty much got it ready to go now. New harness design and I made one with a spinner like a HeliDawg. Tested today and they ran amazing with light of heavy lead and the one with the spinner - amazing. You can feel the blade vibrating and the bait still had a great belly roll and thump.  Getting 2 different new plastisols tomorrow and just need to see which firmness is best for the bait.

982859,Moosebunk,2016-10-04 23:50:00,3970,"I think the fish will look at for about a second, then swallow it whole!"
982901,landry,2016-10-05 17:07:00,1005,I hope so.
982902,manitoubass2,2016-10-05 17:20:00,11391,Please do one solid black.
982904,landry,2016-10-05 17:52:00,1005,I just got new plastisol and dye today so will do. I have been melting down old baits so far. Still looking for clean cheap lead if anyone wants to trade some baits for lead.
982947,mike rousseau,2016-10-06 00:28:00,4661,If you want anyone to test these out I'm down... lol
981725,landry,2016-09-17 23:57:00,1005,Gonna try to post a pic here. Hope it works. I made this from plasticene and then molded it with plaster of Paris. similar to shadzilla but a little bigger and solid plastic. Ran great in my pool??  
981727,landry,2016-09-18 00:14:00,1005,Ordered a cheap airbrush so I can paint eyes... CoLure paint from Lureworks is a water based paint that sticks to soft plastic. Also need to make my own internal harness and weight yet as this one just has a Waterwolf rig inside it. Next is a dawgdussa pattern:)
981731,manitoubass2,2016-09-18 01:23:00,11391,Frig man nice work!!!  Cant wait to see a giant ski next to it!
981733,Rizzo,2016-09-18 02:04:00,4754,looks beauty but I think your reel is on backwards
981741,outllaw,2016-09-18 02:53:00,1232,so it begins . your doomed now. its very addictive lol.
981745,Old Ironmaker,2016-09-18 03:18:00,8243,Very professional looking and it's not done. Reel is on backwards? Looks good to me. Left hand retrieve.
981748,landry,2016-09-18 03:33:00,1005,Thanks guys. I used to paint and do a lot of artsy stuff. I'm hooked bad in this. It's a different creative outlet. I will share more as I progress.
981751,OhioFisherman,2016-09-18 04:16:00,6623,"landry, hidden weight or sinks on it's own?"
981759,landry,2016-09-18 12:51:00,1005,It has weight inside. Eventually I am going to make a mold for the lead so if fits on the wire harness I made so there are two trebles on bottom and no top hook.
981764,mike rousseau,2016-09-18 13:57:00,4661,Looks good to me
981770,OhioFisherman,2016-09-18 16:41:00,6623,It has weight inside. Eventually I am going to make a mold for the lead so if fits on the wire harness I made so there are two trebles on bottom and no top hook.  Cool! Your reel even has the handle on the right side!
981771,NANUK,2016-09-18 16:43:00,797,Looks good ! Now you have to stock some muskies in your pool ?
981776,JoshS,2016-09-18 16:58:00,729,That's awesome. I always say I gotta start making those. It's gonna feel like quite the accomplishment when it gets eaten for the first time.
981781,misfish,2016-09-18 17:51:00,29133,"Dont let anyone tell you that you can buy baits. You made something with your own hands. I did the same with some wooden musky baits. Was just playing around. Some worked, some didnt. Trial and error. It,s a great self satisfaction moment..  I like."
981806,manitoubass2,2016-09-18 23:08:00,11391,"Good god brian, your better than me!  I made some bass cranks from balsa and it took me all winter to make 4 hahahah  Gonna do it again though because one colourway was friggen unreal(black head, glow in the dark green)  Its friggen hard to hand carve a lure that runs true. But super fun and amazing when it hooks lips!"
981886,landry,2016-09-20 01:44:00,1005,I made a couple more. I also made a couple masters for molding again in case my mold breaks.  http://s1233.photobucket.com/user/landrysmith/media/Mobile%20Uploads/image_1.jpeg.html
981903,AKRISONER,2016-09-20 12:34:00,5558,when are they going up for sale?  looks very nice lol
981923,PUMP KNOWS,2016-09-20 17:32:00,937,That's sick!  How long does the process take from start to finish product?
981927,landry,2016-09-20 19:51:00,1005,"It's not that tough actually. I made the shape using plasticene, then poured it in one evening. Dried it for a week. Then coated it with thinned glue a few times on a Saturday. Poured the first baits that night. The weighted harnesses are the trickiest part. I am still tweaking that. Once I get the details all sorted out I may sell some. I need to test their durability this fall though they seem really tough    I also may add airbrushing and a clear coat. I am treating it like a fun art project. They are already fish worthy. The other details are for me."
981928,landry,2016-09-20 19:53:00,1005,The plastisol is very stinky. Doin it in open garage with proper organic respirator. This stuff is nasty.
982030,singingdog,2016-09-22 11:50:00,1047,Very nice! I wouldn't worry too much about eyes; I don't find they make that much of a difference.
982046,landry,2016-09-22 19:37:00,1005,I agree totally but they look nice
982521,landry,2016-09-29 21:32:00,1005,This is how I was planning to set up my .062 wire harness for my soft swimbait. Red represents lead obviously. Do you think hooking the wire inside the lead will be strong enough? Thanks guys Landry  
982527,mike rousseau,2016-09-29 22:43:00,4661,Strong enough not to straighten the eye out  Most likely  How much harder is it to loop back around the frame?
982532,landry,2016-09-29 23:17:00,1005,It's very stiff wire and hard to keep the whole harness flat. I could possibly twist it but it will be a challenge.
