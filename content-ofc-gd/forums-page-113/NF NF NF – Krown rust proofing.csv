982446,wildeye rainbow,2016-09-28 19:38:00,123,I've used Krown for decades.  I had a 93 Dodge Caravan that I got rid of in 2011.  I Krowned it every year and towards the end every other year.  It only had some minor surface rusting when I got rid of it - body was solid.  WR
982589,ketchenany,2016-09-30 22:22:00,3229,Well here it is. I used Krown at Hwy 7 and Creditstone. They did spray the seals with silicone. I asked before they started and it's what they do. Very Professional and a clean shop. It did drip and was told the first 4 hours would be the worst and it does get better very soon. They also told me the drip dissapear on their own. Well see.  keep was washed after the application  So far I'm happy with them.  Thanks for all of your comments and suggestions. All were noted and evaluated.
982613,RHK,2016-10-01 13:05:00,15,"Just watch with Krown, find the right dealer as many have stated. Had my wifes Civic done a few times and it White. The paint is now stained around the door handles and hood line. They applied so much under the hood that it does not matter were you touch you were covered in it. Hands would get full of it just opening the hood to check the oil."
982614,scugpg,2016-10-01 14:23:00,1373,Just had a vehicle done at krown. Have done other vehicles in the past and no major issues and seemed to help a bit with the rust.  One thing to watch would be wear old clothes when driving it home. Noticed a bit of the interior and steering wheel had a light sheen from the guys being in/out of the car. Dish soap and water cleaned it up.  Understandable considering they would get covered in that aerosol over time it'd be hard not too. but should have wiped it down better...

982291,wkrp,2016-09-26 13:48:00,656,Go for it. They  do a very thorough job.
982292,vance,2016-09-26 13:52:00,719,I have used Krown for 15yrs and I didn't have any rust on my previous truck or on the 6 yr old truck I have now. But like anything you have to find a GOOD shop to get it done.  vance
982293,esoxansteel,2016-09-26 13:54:00,1307,"Many wait till late fall when there swamped, or already had the first dumping of salt, i do mine early usually july/august   and Krown does have a deal to try to spread out the customer base to avoid the late fall rush if you are a CAA member you will save some bucks  I use Krown but they are independent dealers and everyone is different, what i would do if your spare is underneath take if off so they can spray the cover shield ie salt protector as loads of salt get between the tire and frame over winter  My Krown in Peterborough is excellent since new ownership and management  my 2005 Grand Cherokee is a 2005 and shows NO rust with 180,000 kms"
982300,Tomcat,2016-09-26 14:36:00,395,I've been spraying my vehicles with Krown since 2000. I've been quite satisfied with results. I concur with Vance - do your due diligence to pick a good shop.
982301,Mister G,2016-09-26 15:08:00,1429,"I gave up any kind of rust proofing in the 80's......and now my vehicles are rust free....I can't say that about the ones that were ""rust proofed"" ...MANY manufactures recommend NOT getting anything done and could even void the rust thru warranty......check before you do anything.  BTW my truck is 9  years 4 months old and no rust whatsoever."

982305,JoshS,2016-09-26 15:21:00,729,I don't get it mister G. Pretty sure rust proofing is proven effective. How do you prevent rust?

982314,Mister G,2016-09-26 16:00:00,1429,"I don't get it mister G. Pretty sure rust proofing is proven effective. How do you prevent rust? Had a 1975 Olds, '77 Blazer, 80 Pinto wagon, 84 Ford Club Wagon, 89 Impala wagon,  which were all ""rust proofed"" and all got rusted.....in '95 I purchased a Saturn so that basically stopped my rust problem. Then I had a 1995 GMC Safari, 2001 Ford Escape and now a 2007 Toyota and 2009 Honda all which were NOT rust proofed because the manufacture recommended against it. None of which rusted. Sometimes the so called ""rust proofing"" is actually doing more harm then good because it can clog up important drain holes in panels.  But the biggest thing now a days is the manufactures are using better material in crucial areas, like plastic inner fender panels and or galvanized metal.  Trust me, skip the rust proofing........I was skeptical as you are now but time has proven the manufactures recommendation as good advice."
982323,Fisherman,2016-09-26 17:46:00,7201,"Some rustproofing such as the hard sprayed on ""tar"" type film is a bloody disaster.  Any chips and cracks allows the winter corrosion in behinds it and then rusts off in large chunks.  The wax oil type is much better.  As for some auto companies do not recommend it as they have their own system. VW has a 12 year corrosion rust through warranty right from the factory.   Everyone has opinions and we all know what they smell like."
982325,Rob,2016-09-26 18:39:00,467,"Make sure you have someone who knows how to drill holes into your vehicle. My brand new F150 had been done by a Krown location and and the guy put an ""outy dent"" in my door skin. Then when I call him on it he said it wasn't them. Really now, so I just get a brand new truck and it happens to have a dent from the inside right where you guys drilled a hole? Eventually he agreed and paid for the repair. I still use Krown because I believe in the product, but go to a different location and they are really good.  Rob C"

982332,Joeytier,2016-09-26 19:45:00,3990,"I use the krown in North bay, and they do a fantastic job.  By the time they're done, all my doorwells and my engine compartment are freaking spotless and their application is perfect.  Conversely, the Rust Check in North Bay did a poor job, took longer, and was more expensive.  I think it depends more on your local shop then the franchise, just make sure you get it done."
982355,NANUK,2016-09-27 00:17:00,797,"I have been using Krown for the last 20+ years, my current truck is 11 years old, no rust on any of my vehicles, You can have it done anytime of the year, product works all the same, Krown says spring is the best time to spray. It will drip for a couple of days, so if you have a fancy new driveway, park on the street. Most Krown shops/franchises are good and well trained and do an excellent job, The one on Midwest Rd in Scarborough is very good. I will not go to the one on Sheppard Ave east of McCowan Rd."
982400,ketchenany,2016-09-28 00:12:00,3229," Never heard of them, do they have a marketing plan? I'm in marketing in certain ways.  How many vehicles have you had done? What  were the results? I would like to see a 10-year result . . .  Or is the CDN/US army taking us? Do they really undercoat military vehicles? Spend OUR $ on something that may get blown up.

Cdn Tire uses their product, you can buy the cans called http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/rust-cure-formula-3000-0477985p.html . They also apply it along with a searchable dealership.

Tested by both US and CDN military, it has a much better record.https://corrosionfree.com/ I was a big Krown fan until a local applier did not protect rubber parts with a silicone spray first, my vehicle appliques and rubber swelled and was damaged, and the owner of the place blamed me saying ""your car wash soap went bad and did that damage"". (later contacted Simonize who told me the soap had an unlimited life span - shake if frozen at some point) I complained to Krown corporate and the Auto Protection Association who are their boosters and little was done about my damage. After some research, realized that Krown does swell door gaskets and other rubber parts and can harm certain types of wiring harnesses as well.  I switched to Corrosion Free - although research indicates Canadian Tire is not the place to get it done - and have been happy since. Treatment lasts 18 months, no swelling of gaskets, and surface rust has stopped on frame and underbody. For those who don't think at least an under oil spray is useful, consider the damage done to brake lines by the new liquid anti ice stuff they are using on highways now - much more corrosive than 'rock' salt or calcium."

More heavily for the first couple of days.  I had it on my driveway the first year I had it done for 1 day after the spray.  Spots everywhere, but they washed off with rain."
982433,Mike Pike,2016-09-28 16:40:00,1332,I'm a huge fan of Krown.  I've have used both their Stoney Creek location and Waterloo location for probably over a dozen years.  Very professionally run outlets and I am well satisfied with the results.  I'm pretty particular about my vehicles and I like to keep 'em looking good and rust-free.  Two thumbs up.  Did a great job on restoring my headlights too.  They're like new.
