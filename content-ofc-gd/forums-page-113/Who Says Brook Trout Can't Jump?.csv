982502,craigdritchie,2016-09-29 20:29:00,1586,"I was shooting some photos of salmon jumping at a dam the other day. It was only after I started going through the pictures that I happened to notice this guy, way in the back of one of the shots. I know this image is lousy ... it's zoomed in and cropped like crazy ... but still. There's no mistaking what it is. Who knew that brookies could jump like that?   "
982503,Bill Shearer,2016-09-29 20:31:00,456,Great shot and proof that where there is a will.....
982506,dave524,2016-09-29 20:42:00,4508,"About ten years ago there was a lake run Brookie that caught several years running in the Credit River fish lifting operation at the Streetsville dam, maybe it is one of his progeny.  Cool .    edit: here's a couple of pics of the one that got lifted at Streetville back in 2008 and again in 2009 2nd pic, who know's a few more sightings and they will rival the Atlantic run    "
982530,Joeytier,2016-09-29 23:12:00,3990,Was this a lake o trib?  Cool shot!
982534,dave524,2016-09-29 23:30:00,4508,"Was this a lake o trib? Cool shot!  old-mill-speck.jpg , guessing it's the Humber River.  Back in the 80's we'd get those Laker backcross Splake a crazy distance up the Bighead in the fall, caught them at the 13th concession which was the end of the fall extended season water, whoda thunk."
982538,Joeytier,2016-09-29 23:47:00,3990,"Crazy, so either it was a lake run (???) Or a resident that somehow managed to persist in scuzzy Humber River water?"
982540,misfish,2016-09-29 23:56:00,29133," old-mill-speck.jpg , guessing it's the Humber River.    I would be surprised if that was there, but it,s been 30 years since I fished there.  Great shot none the less.  Awesome."
982543,craigdritchie,2016-09-30 00:45:00,1586,"Yes on the Humber. I know, I still can't believe it either.  Has to be a lake-run fish. There's no way it would survive through the summer down in the frog water.  Temps would be way too warm.  I'll guess maybe pushing two pounds? Really nice fish."
982553,BillM,2016-09-30 12:44:00,17367,"Craig, that's awesome!!!!!    I need to get down there with my long lens this year.  I always miss out, lol."
982558,JoshS,2016-09-30 13:15:00,729,Super cool!!
982559,Mike Pike,2016-09-30 13:22:00,1332,"Wow, thanks for sharing that interesting observation with us, Craig!  Good catch!!!"
982574,grimsbylander,2016-09-30 15:54:00,3016,Quite remarkable...the jump and the location.
