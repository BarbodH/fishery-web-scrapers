982894,hutch4113,2016-10-05 15:42:00,374,"Buddy wanted to try a new lake to both of us - Cameron.  He is looking to catch a decent size Muskie, and while we knew the sizes may not be there, we understood that Quantity might be - so off we went.  One thing he has going for him is what I will call ""The Streak"" - > if he is captaining the boat, someone on board will catch something - just not him.  .  Unfortunately, this continued to hold true -> however as he stated, at least we did not get skunked.  This hit around 10AM:    By no means a big one for me (Would have been great however if he or his daughter who was with it caught it).  Too bad really because it hit like a freight train, ran a couple of times, jumped completely out of the net, and ran again after we thought it had been contained.  Then when I ready to release real gentle like, it tail flipped in the face (completely deserved) and took off.  As such I was hoping that it meant active fish.  Sadly - that was it for the day.  But it was a gorgeous day to be on the Water - and fishing beats work any day of the week, and twice on Sunday  .    "

Its been a while since I have fished up there but hope to go to Balsam soon. Hopefully the musky fishing has not started to suffer there yet"

Its been a while since I have fished up there but hope to go to Balsam soon. Hopefully the musky fishing has not started to suffer there yet  Since it was a new lake for us, we mainly trolled so we could cover water.  Went up and through Burnt River as well.  The only fish we saw all day is the one I caught, so can't really say anything on Pike - other than we did not catch one, or see one.  I was throwing a Matzuo Kinchou.  I have become addicted to those lures - introduced to them by Mystery Tackle Box.  I really like the flared gills on the fish, and have had excellent success in catching pretty much everything with them.  I wish they had them in bigger sizes, but strangely I still seem to catch big fish, with smaller lures."

Tigers showing up in Cameron more frequently now, not the size of Balsam tigers but give it a few short years,  and Musky 666   Balsam muskies still doing very well, with a good shot at a mid 40s Hybrid to boot"
