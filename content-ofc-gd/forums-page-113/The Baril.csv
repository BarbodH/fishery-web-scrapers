983097,adempsey,2016-10-08 15:56:00,1498,"Nice!   I always wanted to fish out of there in autumn.    I spent a week in the summer fishing there and it was so busy I hated it.    However, there were so many areas that looked amazing for pike fishing that I really wanted to head back in autumn.   Good to see a report from there."
983098,Pigeontroller,2016-10-08 16:56:00,2793,Not sure why you would bother to post pics with your faces covered...Kinda ruins the whole sharing pics thing IMO
983099,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2016-10-08 17:17:00,535,"To be honest when you're holding a fish, nobody is looking at your face anyway.  Nice fish by the way!"

983101,manitoubass2,2016-10-08 18:38:00,11391, When I first started posting here I blocked out my face.   Then I realized OFC accepts my ugly mug.  Or maybe they dont? I just post it anyways???  Howd that musky taste???
983103,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-08 19:16:00,8243,"PAB is a wonderful spot, especially in the fall. Good report. I saw your face at the Canadian Customs Border crossing at Queenston a few weeks ago. Your secret is safe."
983105,cheaptackle,2016-10-08 20:51:00,849,"Geez and I thought I might have been picking on him a bit much in his introduction thread.  Maybe he doesn't need his face recognized for reasons we don't know and he doesn't feel a need to discuss it.  Perhaps he's just shy.  Who knows and who cares?  I sure don't. Nice catch!  I think it's the IMG code you need to paste in from photobucket to get the pictures to appear, as I said before it's been a while. Keep 'em coming!  Michael"

However, there were so many areas that looked amazing for pike fishing that I really wanted to head back in autumn.   Good to see a report from there.   Summer time there is busy with traffic, but as soon as labour day comes it drops right off. There were hardly any boats out when we were there.
