We fished Balsam and Sturgeon lakes boated 18 Muskies saw another 25 from follows , hits and hooked and lost fish . Biggest was 44"" most were between 36"" and 39"" all were healthy and fat except 2 that had sores on them . We caught 2 Tigers on Balsam along with a couple Pike up to 29"" also caught several Bass 2-4 lbs on our Muskie lures . We didn't see a Walleye all week we usual see a couple nice ones on our jerk and glide baits . Dad caught the biggest for the week so I won the $10 but then on the way home I bought lunch LOL . I have to wait until spring Striper season for my next fishing fix so everyone good luck with the rest of the season . "
