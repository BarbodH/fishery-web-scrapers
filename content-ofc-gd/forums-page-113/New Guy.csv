982932,Musky Plug,2016-10-05 23:10:00,398,"Hello guys,  Decided to make an account on the forum since I visit frequently. Anyways local GTA fisherman, fish for all species but have started to transition to mainly musky over the past year lol. Fish mostly the Kawarthas and Georgian Bay. Looking forward to being an member of the community.   On a side note, does anyone know why it takes so long for you to be able to post?   Musky Plug"

Of course you realize that standard RCMP and Canadian Secret Service background checks have to be undertaken from your application to join the board, along with interviewing your great grandparents from both sides AND all three of your ex-wives for character references.  Then's there checking the ownership of your vehicles and vessels, along with your fishing and boating licenses while checking with your neighbours and Revcan.  Along with that is a standard credit check, and employment verification including ensuring that the reasons you offer for taking time off to go fishing are at least believable.  I understand that the previously established minimum quota for consuming wobbly pops may have been adjusted to be more politically correct HOWEVER it too is still checked. After that is all accomplished and passed/approved, then you get to post. Or it may have just been a slow connection...  Michael"

I tired to start another thread, and post some pics of my recent trip but it the pop up said the file size was to big? Am I doing something wrong?"

No worries and as Michael said photobucket is best to use cause then you use the 'link' and when you go to post a pic there is a 'image' icon and when you click on it then it asks for the link to the url of the image.  Otherwise just make sure the image fits the ""max upload size"" if you don't use photobucket.

982976,hutch4113,2016-10-06 12:13:00,374,"For your pictures, the other thing you can do is shrink them in size.  If you have a Photo Editor - you can configure a picture so it is better suited for a Web Page.  In terms of why so long to post -> It is like a fish following a bait - sometimes it likes to lurk for a while, before it strikes.  ."

982998,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-06 17:17:00,8243,All the background checks and application process can be eliminated if you have a nice boat and are willing to take out OFC members on it.  Welcome aboard and sorry to hear you are getting into Musky fishing. Ihave yetto meet a happy Musky fanatic. Lew used to be a stand up comic until he caught his first Esox.
983007,manitoubass2,2016-10-06 18:19:00,11391, I'm laughing waaaaaay too much at this comment
983022,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-06 22:49:00,8243,The poor guy has no idea what I'm talking about. He should get used to trying to figure out what I'm talking about.
983023,cheaptackle,2016-10-06 23:25:00,849,I think we scared him off...  Good thing I didn't mention the initiation rites to be held after his 5th post...(or that he picks up the tab for it too!)  Now who's in charge of bringing the goats this month?  Michael
983028,ketchenany,2016-10-07 00:24:00,3229,"OI, quit scaring nubees away, TJ gets a  cut!  I say welcome no matter what they say! Some of our guys even eat musky!  Just like chicken they say!!!"

Also thanks for the welcome guys. Hoping to post another thread tonight after work about my last couple trips to pointe au baril."
