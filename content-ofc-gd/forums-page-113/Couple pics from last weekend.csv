983027,spincast,2016-10-07 00:11:00,3279,awesome.
983033,chris.brock,2016-10-07 01:26:00,4053, Nice!  The Whiskey Jacks repaid you with some fish.
983039,GBW,2016-10-07 01:46:00,8460,nice and not too often you can feed a bird like that!
983044,Joeytier,2016-10-07 02:04:00,3990,"nice and not too often you can feed a bird like that! With gray jays you can almost always feed them like that.  That's a great day.  I've never seen the inland bows around here cooperate like that.  They're the trickiest of all the game species around here, even though just about every lakes they're stocked in has huge numbers of them."
