981666,wormdunker,2016-09-16 23:03:00,1711,Im sorry to read you are giving up fishing.  Only you know the decisions you must make.  Have fun on the east coast.  Send us some pix.  Myself - I can't imagine giving up fishing!  I've been fishing since about 5 years of age & have no plans of giving up yet.  Matter of fact I'll be heading to Horwood Lake in 10 days after my 21 day work schedule at Kashechewan reserve north of Moosonee.

982223,pics,2016-09-25 06:52:00,1268,An East coast report would be awesome!!.. we also stop in Drummondville on the way east.. a hotel desk clerk once told us to park near the front door and we always follow that kind of advice.. that and buy gas at the last Ontario station and the first new Brunswick one because the price in Quebec is too high..although the price of beer at the Costco there is right!!..

A few weeks before Jen passed I took everything work related to airplane out of my shop, stuffed it allÂ into marine containers and went back to my old cars for a different road for my mind to travel. Change is good and it can be healthy to explore new things or in the case of my cars old things that have been neglected for decades.  Enjoy the time and travels with the Mrs ! Be well !      "

Anyways, just to clarify, there's absolutely nothing wrong with me and I'm healthy as a horse, infact most days I still feel like I'm 18. I just lost the passion for fishing and have no regrets about packing it in and selling all my gear. I'll still be doing all my normal trips up north with good friends from this board but fishing won't be at the top of the list.  I'm off to find some breakfast now and get ready to hit the road, we've got a long drive ahead of us.  Thanks again, your a good group. Howdy Lew, I'm glad to read this and hoping we can hook up again next August at Memquisit. We've scheduled the same 2 weeks as before and sure missed it this year. Anyhow, if you're going, whether we fish or not, let's take some nice boat rides and have a few nice dinners with our brides, sit down by the water and just generally Bull.  I haven't been on this board in months, and as you might suspect generally don't do FB and the other stuff, but do think of you guys often and I'm very glad everyone is doing well."

""We're done with fishing and camping"".  Their ruse was a brilliant one. Now that the kids own the boat and fishing gear, they have to take my parents out. Parents just show up with a coffee thermos and a hat."

But you never know what life changes are in store for oneself. I keep telling myself how long can I keep pushing my boat by hand up my driveway and into my garage, I can barely do it now. I can understand your change Lew. Enjoy your trip east and take your time, lots to see."
981379,TenInchJake,2016-09-12 17:03:00,21,All the best Lew. I'll try to boat the occasional musky on one of your old lures.  Don't think I could pull off the 'Lew Musky Smile' though.
981382,Cast-Away,2016-09-12 18:32:00,790,"Good for you Lew, i know where you are coming from. If you are doing little or no fishing any more and lost interest then why keep the boat and the equipment? We all change our hobbies over our lifetime and sometimes there is just too much work involved for what you get out of something.  My buddy and I stopped camping and fishing 3 years ago because he no longer wanted to camp. Now we don't even get out fishing and I rarely see him. I simply go fishing with others instead. I do miss camping on Georgian Bay at remote campsites though. I am not ready to give up the boat, I enjoy boating too much even if I don't fish as often.  I took up guitar about 6 years ago and put it aside after one year. Now I am staring lessons again.  I starting flying RC planes 5 years ago and love it. I recently built a 65"" WWII P-51 Mustang from a box of balsa and loved the whole building experience. I took me 275 hours from start to finish.  Life happens and as we age, our priorities change."

I am sore after a day of fishing or sitting in a Golf cart for 18 holes and now need 3 days to start walking without a limp, sore head to toe. Pain has a way of curbing passion. To be blunt if you told me 10 years ago how I would feel about Sex now at 62 I would have called you insane."

981412,chris.brock,2016-09-13 02:49:00,4053,"Me too.  Reading Lew's stuff over the years, I don't think he's tired and sore, I think it's more ""fishing is great, but spending time with loved ones is far more important."""
981413,scuro2,2016-09-13 02:54:00,904,65 years eh? A decision to give it up cold turkey could be as much about the fishing world changing as it could be about the body changing.

If you are not enjoying the moments available to you, you are not creating new memories. There will be a time when most of what you have left are memories. In some cases, those memories could be difficult to recall.  All the best Lew and keep checking in. As an east coaster from New Brunswick, I trust and hope you return from your trip with many great memories and a fondness for the area and the people."

Diabetes and Bladder Cancer kills the prostrate. I love listening to guys I know in their late 60's and 70's telling stories of recent conquests, they are full of Sh&^T. I'm not dead below the waist completely, not yet anyway. I just don't do it 7 times a day like I did 10 years ago.  Lew, I apologize."

I hear you about kind of loosing the passion, it happens. I am glad to hear your are healthy, without that what do we have? Poor health is something I never, ever even thought about. Bad knees but that was it until 8 years ago really. I always thought I would take after my father who is going to be 90. We bought him a new gel seat for his Mountain bike for his 80th. Nope took after my mother who has been dying of the same heart attack for 50 years.  I'm feeling better though everyday.  Enjoy big guy."

981280,lew,2016-09-11 11:45:00,12766,"I mentioned awhile back that after 65 years of fishing, the last 40 odd years basically chasing nothing but muskies, I decided to call it quits and sold my boat and a bunch of gear to a bud up north that owns a fishing camp.  I also listed a lot of rods, reels and baits on this board and was able to sell it all very quickly.  I kept my favorite rod & reel plus a few more baits for another friend and he came yesterday and picked it all up.  Only thing left is a Mustang HIT inflatable jacket ...MD3153...that needs a new canister but we're leaving tomorrow morning for Nova Scotia and PEI so I may list it here when I get home.  Seems strange...and empty... in the garage now with no boat and no tackle after all these years but it's what I wanted to do.  The last 65 years and I've fished with a lot of good friends and family, done a pile of travelling and have boated plenty of nice fish and best of all is so many great memories. My garage walls are full of pictures to keep reminding me of fun trips.  I don't post here much any more but still enjoy reading the fishing tales and will continue to do so even though fishing for me is now just a spectator sport."

Hope withdrawal symptoms won't be too bad. Just don't take up that other past time. You know, that 4 letter word. You'll have time now to work on that smile Cheers Peter."
981298,lew,2016-09-11 14:44:00,12766,"Thanks boyz and also thanks for the offers of fishing. Not saying I'll never fish again but it'll just be very occasionally if I do.

981341,Dabluz,2016-09-11 20:28:00,701,"Wow.....quit fishing.....unfathomable.  I have a couple of brothers-in-law that no longer do any fishing.  I introduced them to fishing and they seemed to love it but after a few years, they just quit.  I see few friends take up fishing, buy a boat or canoe and then after a while, they just seem to quit going.  But after 65 years, very hard to understand.  I'm 69 and started fishing for brook trout in streams when I was about 3 years old.  At 5 years old, I was fishing on my own in the nearby creeks for chub and fishing with my dad who went fishing often.  I like to eat fish and I keep most of the fish I catch.  When I go on a trip, I always pack some fishing equipment.  After all of those years, I finally have a decent boat and a good canoe.  I also do a lot of icefishing.  I hope to be able to go on fishing for at least 10 more years.  I love to go fishing.  I know a lot about fishing and I am considered a good fisherman.  I could have become a ;guide but I was afraid of  losing my love for the sport by turning it into a job."
