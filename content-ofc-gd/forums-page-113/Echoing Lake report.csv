982704,chris.brock,2016-10-02 22:20:00,4053," Echoing Lake Camp lays claim to being the most northern camp in Ontario. It was over 2 hours flying in a Caravan to get there from Sioux Lookout.  A cool perk is that there is a Beaver on floats at Echoing and the owner Shawn has boats cached on various lakes in the area.  We spent 4 nights at the camp and 3 nights at their Yelling Lake outpost.  I've been playing around with movie maker and put this together, it's a little cheesy.  "
982706,Joeytier,2016-10-02 22:50:00,3990,Amazing Chris!  Does Echoing have all 3 species or were the lakers from yelling?  And did the lakes live up to their names?
982709,huzzsaba,2016-10-02 23:02:00,884,Great video! Thanks
982710,chris.brock,2016-10-02 23:06:00,4053,"Echoing has lakers, whitefish and pikes.  Yelling has lakers, pikes, eyes and brookies in the river but we were OOS for brookies.  When I was doing wolf howls after dark there was a haunting echo that lasted for a crazy long time. Not joking."
