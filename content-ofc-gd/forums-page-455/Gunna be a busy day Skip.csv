652651,NAW,2012-01-02 16:10:00,4022,Anyone else getting pounded with snow right now?  I'm going for a rip on the sled tonight!
652652,misfish,2012-01-02 16:17:00,29133,Ya this front is about 9 hours behind.
652655,BillM,2012-01-02 16:35:00,17367,Pretty much a blizzard outside right now... No complaints from me!
652661,irishfield,2012-01-02 16:53:00,26272, Well I hope it has stopped somewhat as I'm about to leave with daughter #2 for Cambridge.
652665,NAW,2012-01-02 17:01:00,4022,Nope..  Still coming down strong.  It's been off and on all morning.
652668,irishfield,2012-01-02 17:03:00,26272,Sun just came out here.. blue sky.... STRONG West wind.. maybe you're just getting squalled from Nottawasaga Bay.. I can only hope... time to check the radar!
652672,Billy Bob,2012-01-02 17:14:00,5865,Sunshine....but the palm trees need watering again...LOL
652678,Fisherman,2012-01-02 17:32:00,7201,"They're just narrow streamers, came back from BPro, from Cookstown north was a bit of a slowdown, past Barrie it's okay.  If you wait 10 minutes it can change."
652710,Rod Caster,2012-01-02 20:11:00,5784,A fair bit of it up north here... I wish the snow would come after the cold. Its all backwards
652717,BillM,2012-01-02 20:33:00,17367,Front door taken 5 mins ago...  I don't think it's going to let up anytime soon.  
652719,Sinker,2012-01-02 20:49:00,8692,Nothin out this way....suckers!! hahaha  S.
652723,BillM,2012-01-02 20:54:00,17367,How's snowmobiling work without snow?
652725,Sinker,2012-01-02 20:58:00,8692," We've had snow for at least a week. We had a white christmas here, and its still here! I have about 6"" on my lawn as it is. That's enough for me!!  Like I said...suckers!! hahaha  S."
652727,BillM,2012-01-02 21:00:00,17367,"I still don't see your point, who's complaining about the snow?  I'm excited to get my Ariens out of the garage!  lol"
652731,Billy Bob,2012-01-02 21:13:00,5865,"Oh Boy, the palm trees are starting to take on snow.....that can't be good for them....    .....damn Canadian snow storms...."
652740,irishfield,2012-01-02 22:07:00,26272," Weather be no problem for you Bob... stuck in the middle lane, 5K slower than anyone else... with your hazard lights on!  I handed the keys to my truck to the kids boyfriend and told him to do the drive. Hope I get it back in one piece. Took them from 2:30 to now (5pm) to get to Bradford and she says they're now out of the squall. 2.5 hours to go what generally takes me 55 minutes to get to Terry's house."
652746,Billy Bob,2012-01-02 22:30:00,5865, Yep that's me....LOL....hey wait....no middle lane here....barely north and south lane here....what should I do....  But anyways the nasty snow stopped (less then 1 inch) and now it's moonshine time again  ....
652751,misfish,2012-01-02 23:02:00,29133,"Ya Wayne, the wife called once she got past Innisfil rd.Sunshine the rest of the way into work."
652764,NAW,2012-01-03 00:07:00,4022,"I made it home in 35, usually takes me 30.  I was surprised how easy the drive was."
652783,tb4me,2012-01-03 01:05:00,3295,Nothing here in Brantford at all..Unlike others I want it..Bring it on Ma nature!
652786,Skipper D,2012-01-03 01:21:00,1970,"Hi there Nick , your right it was a busy day , i left a 4 this morning and just got in about ten minutes ago , have to leave at midnight and do it all over again  . Good night every one ."
652792,Twocoda,2012-01-03 01:26:00,4130,i think i would rather water BBs palm trees for him ....but as it is now....im in a catch 22....if i snowblow the lane right now it might be perceived as anxious....if i dont ....it could be perceived as lazy....it doesnt look like there is enough on the road for a snowplow to make much of a bank so im going to opt for the lazy perception...  trail passes for the sledders doesnt seem like a very good investment this year
