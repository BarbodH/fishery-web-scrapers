652181,misfish,2011-12-31 17:30:00,29133,"First off, anyone use them while out ice fishing in thier portable, and how long will one canaster last you? Settings?  I bought one as a duel purpose. Heat and for cooking while out there. Grilled cheese and spam.YUMMY.LOL   Thanks."
652184,Leecher,2011-12-31 17:37:00,7832,"Brian, are you talking about the porta-stove, one burner?  If so a canister will last you about 6h on high... that's what I use for boiling the deer rack when I have one to do of course  Just make sure that you don't leave outside over night in the freezing cold prior leaving cause you'll have a hard time igniting your stove  Butane is not as volatile as propane"
652188,misfish,2011-12-31 17:58:00,29133,Yeah thats the one J. Im looking it over and trying to see if I can convert it over to propane.  Nothing worse then a cold lighter and ya got no matches.LOL
652192,Leecher,2011-12-31 18:07:00,7832, I hear you B. I don't think you can convert them to propane though... just make sure you leave the canister indoors prior to leaving and you should be fine   that is in the winter time
652246,aplumma,2011-12-31 20:57:00,6896,The unit can't be safely converted to propane the orifices are larger for butane. The unit I have I use to melt lead in a small lead ladle and it seems that if you don't have a pan or pot on it the heat does not warm up the butane tank and the flame gets weak as the can gets colder. I usually have to warm up the canister with my leather glove to get the flame back up higher. I guess if you keep a pot of water on it it will work and also add humidity to the hut. A minor concern also is it does not have a low oxygen cut off.   Art
652288,EC1,2011-12-31 23:21:00,930,"I was wondering, does a butane burner produce enough heat to warm a hut like an actual heater? It would be amazing to actually make hot food when on the ice!"
652296,irishfield,2011-12-31 23:42:00,26272, Say what.. we boil water.. make Mr Noodles.. heat cans of Ravioli.. heat sandwich wraps rolled up in tinfoil. No need to go hungry out on the ice.    
652298,gaspumper,2011-12-31 23:44:00,393,If you use a buddy heater you can have hot meals also.
652299,Terry,2011-12-31 23:45:00,14456,lots of Mr Noodles on the ice  I mean we ate a lot of them while on the ice  and those wraps or whatever we called them
652300,misfish,2011-12-31 23:45:00,29133,"Thats propane,not butane.   Ah chef boy r d."
652301,Terry,2011-12-31 23:46:00,14456,yeah I think he was just showing that people do heat food on the ice and it's not all that amazing
652305,misfish,2011-12-31 23:51:00,29133,"  Oh, like peanut butter sandwiches."
652306,irishfield,2011-12-31 23:54:00,26272,Hey... if you freeze to death with that butane thing.. we're not letting you in our huts with real heat!
652308,misfish,2011-12-31 23:56:00,29133,"  If Im dead,I guess not."
652311,irishfield,2012-01-01 00:02:00,26272,I guess you're right.. if we thawed you out again the meat would be no good for Betty!
652319,EC1,2012-01-01 00:18:00,930,"Unfortunately I don't think I'll ever lug a 20lb propane cylinder out with me. I even had a hard time staying inside my own hut when fishing...Lol.  I'm wondering though, is there a product that works as both a heater and stove?"
652322,Terry,2012-01-01 00:24:00,14456,guys heat with the mister buddy and cook with it too I have seen people who make a special rack to hold the pot to boil water and the one that Irishfield is using can come with the connection of 1lb tanks  I have used this one to heat and cook with on the ice   
652350,Ice_ice,2012-01-01 08:32:00,18,EC1 ... There is one product: it's called your BBQ. I don't use it in winter time anyways so I take the guts out. Hot dog on ice are awesome. Think I will actually get a real heater for this winter. Got to look like I know what I'm doing out there lol
652377,Beans,2012-01-01 14:16:00,3339,Where's your old stove Brian ?   
652437,misfish,2012-01-01 19:42:00,29133,"LOL Norm  That huts up at my pops. If I get a sled,I may bring it back down to use.   Terry,I have that one right now."
652482,chefboi17,2012-01-02 00:13:00,128,Anyone have a pic of the mods I would need to make to a buddy heater to cook/ warm food? I have one but would like to have an idea of what needs to be done to it before I start breaking it apart
652500,irishfield,2012-01-02 01:05:00,26272,"  I sure hope you're a lot older than Terry or I if you need to ""lug"" that 20lb'r!   You can put it on a 5lb'r if you're out of shape!  Heater and stove... is that not what I'm showing?.. or are you looking for an oven?  Also remember... what I am showing is a catalytic heater... equals LESS chance of carbon monoxide poisoning vs open flame heaters. And I emphasis less... as you have to use common sense with any heater in a hut(including the wood stove!)"
