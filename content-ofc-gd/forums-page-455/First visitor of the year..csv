652809,tb4me,2012-01-03 02:54:00,3295,Funny stuff Roy! awesome picture too!
652851,Billy Bob,2012-01-03 10:18:00,5865," LOL....good one...  Actually eagles from what I have read are a scavenger and will eat dead things they haven't killed. And since there is no season on them, they are off my target list....but it would still be nice if you did check with a NRA member first....LOL"
652858,lew,2012-01-03 11:43:00,12766," There's been several families of Bald Eagles around here for a few years now and it's really nice to see them taking up residence. I got these pics of 2 of them a couple years ago just a few miles from here.      Always nice to see the Pileated Woodpeckers too, their another beautiful bird and there's 3 that hang around here all the time. I had all 3 of them in the tree outside the front window in the summer but didn't get the camera in time.  There's also alot of robins spending the winter here too, infact just 2 weeks ago I counted 30 on my front lawn around the feeder."
652868,Skipper D,2012-01-03 13:53:00,1970,"That Eagle is not smiling for the camera , is it Roy . Another super photo Lew , never knew they were in Ontario , nice to see ."
653003,Skipper D,2012-01-03 22:03:00,1970,Lets keep all the animal picture post together ..lol
653009,Rod Caster,2012-01-03 22:13:00,5784,  Funny you say that. I was at a small landfill today and there were 4 Bald Eagles amonst the dozens of ravens picking at the garbage.
653014,mercman,2012-01-03 22:21:00,7054, And what were you doing there Mister McCaster???
653020,Skipper D,2012-01-03 22:31:00,1970,DROPING REFUGE PAUL ..........
653021,Rod Caster,2012-01-03 22:32:00,5784," Looking for an easy snack  It was for work, McMerc.  Wish I had a better camera, I could have gotten some nice shots."
652590,Roy,2012-01-02 12:31:00,13728,"Looked outside New Year's morning and spotted this little guy at the back of the yard. They're not very plentiful around here. This one appeared to be in fine health. I know, I can never be accused of being a photographer but I fired off 20-30 shots with the Sony.  "
652592,lew,2012-01-02 12:38:00,12766,"Thanks for the morning smile Roy, it's always nice to see the critters come out for a visit !!  I had 4 robins at the feeder yesterday,  a bald eagle overhead and a pileated woodpecker on the tree."
652593,bushart,2012-01-02 12:41:00,2628,He's a beauty---nice coat on him  Maybe he stopped by to see if you had any chickens.
652594,Roy,2012-01-02 12:42:00,13728,"You have lots of wildlife in your ""yard"", Lew. Lots of deer too. Are the deer still around much this year?"
652595,lew,2012-01-02 12:47:00,12766, I've only seen a few deer in the yard sofar this winter  Roy but there's plenty of tracks around. Probably see more once the snow gets deeper.
652596,Terry,2012-01-02 12:48:00,14456,nice shot   
652599,Roy,2012-01-02 12:50:00,13728,Thank you Mr. Terry Wizard. That's a great improvement!
652600,Terry,2012-01-02 12:55:00,14456,hey it's your shot  I just clicked one button on a program that adjusts it to true colour and that is what I got
652601,Live2fish85,2012-01-02 12:56:00,1633,That's an awesome shot Roy.
652606,Jewelbee,2012-01-02 13:21:00,422,Nice to see...They seem to have moved away from my neighborhood
652609,mercman,2012-01-02 13:41:00,7054,Good to know you can still attract the Foxes.... Great shot Bud.They will keep the Meese population down.
652612,danc,2012-01-02 13:57:00,4677,"Morning Roy. Thanks for sharing this shot of your first visitor of the year. I'm thinking of going for a drive later today to see what the Deer are up to, if this wicked wind ever calms down a bit."
652615,Skipper D,2012-01-02 14:15:00,1970,"Notice every one where this little fellow went to visit tho of all place's , I bet his name is Roy too . The same kind always atract. Nice photo Roy , your lucky ."
652627,Billy Bob,2012-01-02 14:42:00,5865,"Errrrr.....""nice shot"" has a whole different meaning to a Redneck...LOL  The last nice shot I had of a red fox was taken from 278 yards away...."
652631,Roy,2012-01-02 15:13:00,13728,"Splains why we no longer see Redd Foxx around anymore, eh?"
652633,Billy Bob,2012-01-02 15:19:00,5865, No....it explains how one got away by migrating north of here...LOL
652662,Leecher,2012-01-02 16:53:00,7832,Gosh darn   that's a great shot Roy
652663,Entropy,2012-01-02 16:58:00,747,Not a blue fox but nice not the less.
652721,Joey,2012-01-02 20:53:00,9122,Just beautiful hon
652726,Sinker,2012-01-02 21:00:00,8692," You know, i was thinking the exact same thing!!!  S."
652732,Tom McCutcheon,2012-01-02 21:15:00,627,"  ""I'm comin Lizabeth"""
652748,Billy Bob,2012-01-02 22:38:00,5865," Yep Shane, the pretty red fox is nice until you find out he's responsible for all the missing game birds in the area...and if you're a farmer I don't even have to explain that....but, that is why I can hunt MANY acres here for fox, coyote and woodchucks that I can't otherwise access for deer hunting....go figure..."
652760,nofish4me,2012-01-02 23:48:00,404," Farmers can shoot, dig, bury, almost anything they'd like to. Late goose season, no problem, just protecting crop. Gets around all laws (not allowed to discharge a firearm within the first 100 acres surrounding the village). Gotta like it. For those that are doubtful, repeated visits by OPP, MNR, local bylaw enfocement, have produced no charges(sad, Ron gets more problem for having a fishing line, than I do a shotgun). I guess the difference would be Rural vs Urban (no $ vs big $). Clear as a whistle. No more visits from anyone, since I call and give heads up what's happening, to the OPP.  By the way, Lew, I'd love to have seen them birds here. The best I've seen here, was a Snow Bunting, lost I guess."
652776,bucktail,2012-01-03 00:56:00,1857,Nice picture Roy!!
652780,Roy,2012-01-03 01:02:00,13728,"Dang, first visitor should have been bald eagle. (although I suspect they kill things too) Maybe next year. The next time I'll check with the farmers and the NRA prior to posting."
