651968,Fisherman,2011-12-30 23:44:00,7201,"Had another Darwin Special on Simcoe today, buddy figured the ice was getting too thick and needed to be broken up with his nomobile.  Unfortunately the rescue crew had to go and pluck his sorry bacon out of the drink.  Nomobiles are those things that don't work well in the water, when you try and start them, they go no no no no!  They added a careless driving charge, should have been wasting oxygen."
651978,OutdoorDan,2011-12-31 00:02:00,325,  Satellite image form the 28th.  Lots of cloud cover but you can see it's pretty much mostly all open.  How do you think of... I don't even... Sigh.
651985,EC1,2011-12-31 00:14:00,930,"Should have kept the nomobile in full throttle!  At least he's ok.. The back lakes barely have enough ice to walk on, so check before you bring your expensive toys out. Or you can just donate them to me!"
652019,NAW,2011-12-31 02:37:00,4022,Brutal...
652034,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-31 03:14:00,0,a lot of my chums tell me i drive like an old man. i just nod and say thank you.
652039,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-31 03:23:00,10439,I think my ice is fairly safe now.    
652043,irishfield,2011-12-31 03:25:00,26272,I don't know Dave.. you probably should still wrap youself in bubble wrap to keep Billy Bob happy!
652047,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-31 03:27:00,10439,  Yeah I know. I wouldn't land a 747 on it yet but I think it may be ready for Tank travel.
652070,livinisfishin,2011-12-31 04:39:00,661,Lol would definitely not be hand bombing that ice dave!
652448,archie_james_c,2012-01-01 20:30:00,618,"I could punch that with my 8"" FinnBore ...... *grin*"
652539,Ron,2012-01-02 03:01:00,1683,"Hope you spudded your way out for safe travel too Drifter, you never know if there was thin spots on the way out.  Cheers, Ron..."

652549,cheaptackle,2012-01-02 03:37:00,849,"Just read about one going thru the ice on Trout Lake (North Bay) last night at 11:30, 1"" of ice where he dropped in.  Michael"
652586,Fisherman,2012-01-02 11:56:00,7201," 11:30 at night on questionable conditions eh, I wonder what the precursor to that was?"
652587,cheaptackle,2012-01-02 12:12:00,849,Article was very brief but at the time I read it there were about 2 dozen comments ripping the rider to shreds.  Rider & rescuers all ok was all the report basically said.  Michael
652846,BassAsin,2012-01-03 07:10:00,806,I'll have to flip you a pic of me hand bombing through 30 inches here in north bay come march. not as tough as one may think.
652948,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-03 20:04:00,10439,"  By March we have over 60"" of ice."
652949,Roy,2012-01-03 20:10:00,13728," Dave, you can't have 60"" of ice on Nipissing. They have to keep some room for water."
652958,Nipfisher,2012-01-03 20:45:00,2449,  YUP. Impaired snowmobiler
652983,Fisherman,2012-01-03 21:39:00,7201,"Figured as much, thanks,"
653119,BassAsin,2012-01-04 03:37:00,806,"i save my time and avoid nip, Roy. except for one little spot for about a week is all."
653122,Nipfisher,2012-01-04 03:40:00,2449, Well you'll have to stop in to my hut on the 28th for the gtg.
653130,OutdoorDan,2012-01-04 04:02:00,325," By the looks of it he blew a long while after the incident, and he still blew over. Impressive."
