651945,COUNTRYBOY,2011-12-30 22:07:00,130,NICE FISH HOWEVER BIG IT WAS. FISHING IS ABOUT THE ENJOYMENT OF THE RELAXING AND HAVING A GOOD TIME. AND A NICE MEAL NOW AND THEN. SO JEALOUS YOUR ICE FISHING AND I'M NOT.
651987,waki5,2011-12-31 00:45:00,34,I would like to see any of those monsters at the end of my line. Take a few pics and hopefully catch him another day. Nice fish guys!
651997,Nipfisher,2011-12-31 01:40:00,2449,"  Countryboy, Why are you always shouting?"
652111,Stoty,2011-12-31 12:41:00,2910, Couldn't agree more!!!!  Great report and wicked fish!! Very jealous that I can't get out on the ice yet!!
652251,fishindevil,2011-12-31 21:15:00,6254,well done man !!!!    happy new year !!!!!
651723,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-30 00:37:00,10439,Took my buddies kid out pikin' today and he had a blast. Got the big one of the day too!!!! We ended up landing about 20 fish with a bunch of small ones a few in the 10 to 12 pound class and this guy up around 22 pounds!!!! The kid is spoiled now and will have to be put down!!!    
651724,mike rousseau,2011-12-30 00:38:00,4661,Wow...  Sweet fish...
651726,Rizzo,2011-12-30 00:40:00,4754,beauty pike! Good numbers too
651732,danc,2011-12-30 00:58:00,4677,22 lbs??   Typo Dave?
651735,Leecher,2011-12-30 01:06:00,7832,I bet he's hooked now... Nice gator    Congrats to him
651740,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-30 01:14:00,10439," Not a typo Dan, fish is 43"" and thick."
651747,Joey,2011-12-30 01:34:00,9122,Nice Gator
651749,danc,2011-12-30 01:37:00,4677," 44 1/2 and thicker. 16,17 lbs. depending where the scale landed at the time (I'm 6'2"" 240 lbs.). Caught this guy about 6 or 7 years ago and it was the last fish I ever weighed. I guess my point is that I'm not a big supporter of weighing fish if they are going to be released. . A length and a quick photo is good enough in todays catch and release society. Weighing a fish is just another, and probably the most stressful thing that you can do to a fish. The accuracy of any scale is questionable. Who care what it weighs? Just show us a photo and let us guess what it weighed.  "
651754,BillM,2011-12-30 01:42:00,17367,"Dan, I bet you weren't too happy when you hooked into that were ya  :)"
651766,danc,2011-12-30 01:52:00,4677," Do I look happy?? Caught it about a hundred yards from where you caught your beast last year Bill. With a history like that, I'll have to start avoiding that place best I can. Problem is that I've caught a bunch of 6 and 7 lb. Brookies in the same place. Ooopps. Make that 23 and 24 inch Brookies."
651767,livinisfishin,2011-12-30 01:53:00,661,Awesome fish! Would love to hook into a nice pike like that!
651774,BillM,2011-12-30 02:12:00,17367, I'll be up in June to put a beating on those ugly snakes for you
651788,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-30 03:10:00,10439,Thanks for your input Dan. Don't let the door hit you in the   on the way out of my thread!!
651795,Gerritt,2011-12-30 03:21:00,6129,I see this going very badly now...  Edit: to add that fish looks no more then 15lbs tops.
651798,Roy,2011-12-30 03:28:00,13728,Who the heck cares what it weighed anyway? The young lad caught a nice pike and it was posted for your viewing pleasure. Period.
651801,danc,2011-12-30 03:44:00,4677, Absolutely.
651804,spooner_jr,2011-12-30 03:55:00,193, It's probably close.  Enter the length in the link.  http://www.fishingreporters.com/fish-calculators/
651809,Nipfisher,2011-12-30 04:01:00,2449,Just to support Dave and stick it to non-believers. I have a Northern mounted on my livingroom wall that was caught through the ice in 2006. It was 43 and 3/4 inches long and weighed just over 22 lbs.              If you all want to guess the weight....go ahead. I know what it weighed and don't really give a crap what you think about it.  ****That is the hook and 8 lbs. line I caught it on in the corner of the mouth.****   Nice 22 pound pike for the young lad Dave.
651815,spinnerbaitking,2011-12-30 04:15:00,1622,Congrats on the Gator & I really don't care what it weighs It's a nice fish SBK
651839,Rod Caster,2011-12-30 13:09:00,5784,"Looks like a better outing than the last time. I guess you guys have your confidence back, huh? I havent caught a northern like that since my northern alberta days... Very nice man!!"
651840,solopaddler,2011-12-30 13:18:00,8605,Nice pike buddy. Have yourself a great new years up in the great white north.   Cheers

651869,bubbles,2011-12-30 15:01:00,591,"Happens EVERY time, everyone wants pics and stories and as soon as you give them one........  Fantastic fish!"
651893,mr blizzard,2011-12-30 16:31:00,1589,"Dave thanks for taking my son out yesterday, he had a blast. Hopfully I can get out in a week or so. And for all the readers, Mr Blizzard and his family made the move to Yellowknife from Barrie 5 or 6 weeks ago. If it was not for crossing paths with Dave through the OFC we would never have been able to experience the chance of a lifetime. It was a big move but the opportunities here are amazing. And as for the fishing, unbelievable, the pictures say it all. Look forward to giving more pics and postings again. Mr Blizzard is finally home, ice fishing the beginning of December life is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dave truly knows his stuff."
651906,Fishnwire,2011-12-30 18:06:00,983," Apparently, you care what it weighs.  Why else are you questioning how much someone else thinks it does?"
