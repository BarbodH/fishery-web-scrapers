Will it happen, I hope so. Bassmaster4"
652093,Woodsman,2011-12-31 10:56:00,1286,The story you referenced was a month old & is no longer valid.
652094,davey buoy,2011-12-31 11:20:00,5505,Bell and rogers are now the main shareholders
652098,Live2fish85,2011-12-31 11:49:00,1633,Actually if I not mistaken the teachers union has decided to keep there share which if I am correct makes them the main holders.
652100,Jer,2011-12-31 11:52:00,1426,"  You are mistaken...the teachers pension plan sold all their shares to Rogers and Bell a few weeks ago for $1.3 billion.  Even the ""Great One"" doesn't have that kinda scratch..."
652112,Stoty,2011-12-31 12:43:00,2910," Correct!  Now.... hopefully Bell/Rogers see how completely USELESS Schenn is, and trades him for a used puck bag and some stick tape or something! At least those things have a purpose and don't cause 10 give-a-ways per game!"
652122,Live2fish85,2011-12-31 13:37:00,1633,Oh for some reason I thought that they backed out on selling it lol. Some times my brains makes things up I guess.  Your correct about Schenn as well in my eyes at least. I think once Dion came that was when his game went down hill.
652146,bigbuck,2011-12-31 14:48:00,2449,"Hopefully we will see an improvement in the team but with big co's, they are like the Teachers pensions fund and will be interested in clipping their coupon every month (bottom line profits). I hope I'm wrong but I personally believe there has to be a face to the ownership."
652148,aniceguy,2011-12-31 15:02:00,1094,"The leafs have and will be for the foreseable future concerned with bottom life return on investment and its been shown in Toronto you dont have to have a winning or even a competative team to produce profits.  Once an individual owner buys it and sees the attendence drop and Toronto loses interest in hockey maybe then, realy who sees that ever happening in To?"
652476,bassmaster4,2012-01-01 23:27:00,801,"very true haha kind of skimmed through it and got a little excited probably wouldnt have changed anything though,   thanks for letting me know"
