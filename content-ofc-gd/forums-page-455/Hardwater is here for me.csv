652745,mike rousseau,2012-01-02 22:22:00,4661,Got out for the first time this weekend for a couple short days (4 hours each day)  on the ice...  Got to fish Friday Saturday Sunday and today...  We iced at least 400 perch... Most small but entertaining... But we managed a healthy bunch each trip to take home...  Also got a couple bluegill... 2 largemouth...  And these pike on the tip-up today...  The first pike damn near spooled us before we saw the flag was up...             We had 5-6 inches of ice everywhere we fished... And cold weather coming this week will freeze up a couple more spots to try...

I don't have too much line on that rig, I think when the pike came to the end of the line he set the hook on himself! Good thing neither one was strong enough to break it."

652771,mike rousseau,2012-01-03 00:32:00,4661,Yeah zack was pumped to get his first like of the season... And so was I...  The first one almost spooled the tip up and the second one hit so hard it tangled the line around the spool... Then almost pulled the tip up through the hole...
652782,spud7378,2012-01-03 01:04:00,68,Wow what a great day on the ice!!!!
