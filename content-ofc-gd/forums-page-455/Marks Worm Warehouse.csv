652610,crappieperchhunter,2012-01-02 13:52:00,2582,"Great people and a great little store.I have been stopping in there for about 15 years now. They always have quality live bait and keep a good selection of tackle that works for what's biting in the area.  Plus a little tip for anyone who goes up there alot. Mark gets stuff in from his supplier on Tuesdays I believe. We have a place in Caygeon so I am up there every weekend from May until October.  I can go in there on the weekend and if he doesn't have what I am looking for, he will order it and it will be waiting for me when I go up the following weekend. There prices are right in line with places down here in Oshawa. Some stuff cheaper even.  No surprise to me that they treated your folks well GBW. I try to give them as much of my business as I can."
652632,Jer,2012-01-02 15:18:00,1426,"Wow, I've driven past a million times and never realized it was more than a back-shed bait shop.  Looks like really nice store, I'll have to make a point of stopping by."
652714,northernpike56,2012-01-02 20:20:00,717,great shop i always stop by every year on my way to bobcaygeon. they have tons of tackle for good prices too!
652824,GBW,2012-01-03 03:45:00,8460,"I plan on going for a visit just to say thanks, and well, maybe get some new toys..."
653016,Beans,2012-01-03 22:25:00,3339, The great part with Mark being on the advisory council is that it is in P'Boro and gives him a chance to drop stuff off at Shimano...He took my second hand Curado Bantam in a couple of years ago as the drag system was seized on one side (seems someone put the magnets in backwards) and only charged $8...  He had never taken a baitrunner carp reel apart so he cleaned and lubricated and replaced some drag washers and charged me zilch !  What a Guy Eh? He deserves all the custom he can get...
