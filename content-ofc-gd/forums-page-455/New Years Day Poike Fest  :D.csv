At my first spot I only got a couple of hammer handles so I moved to a different area and got into the fish right away. On many occasions they grabbed the bait on my tipup line as I was setting it. I even had a double on the tipup with one pike on each treble of my quick strike rig. Sorry about the quality of the pics as I was fishing solo today. Enjoy.  Some good ice.          The double!!    And my first tourney entry of this years IS tourney. All of my entries this year are dedicated to my friend Terry who lost his life in a moose/car collision just hours after my mom passed away. Friday October 14th was not a good day for me or my friends and family. FYI Terry is the fellow that accompanied me on my ""Ice Road Fishers"" NWT trophy laker quest in the spring of 2010.    Worst pic of the day award!!!! "
