I probably won't make a report later so as not to offend those concerned with other peoples safety.  Just gotta throw the last of my gear in the car.  Debbe did a basement cleanup awhile back and I'm having a heck of a time locating my first ice bubble wrap that ALWAYS goes with me on these trips.  If I'm not heard from again Happy New Years to everyone   :thumbsup_anim:

652110,Big Cliff,2011-12-31 12:39:00,6899,"Let me know how you make out Steve, I may explore the ice in front of our place today but I will post because I'm not worried about offending anyone LOL. If you can't post about fishing on a fishing board, it's time to call it something else"
652253,fishindevil,2011-12-31 21:25:00,6254,"well theres guys out fishing some of the kawartha lakes including pigeon,and sturgeon as well as rice lake !!! there is some safe ice to walk on and tow a portable,but common sense has to be the main factor here ....so i am not going to post any locations and tell people where to fish cause the ice is stil not great and what if someone goes through and you told them where to go and fish this time of year ??? so most guys i talked to at my local bait shop are staying very close to shore and mostly fishing well away from current and open areas far from shore   cheers & happy new year"
652261,Big Cliff,2011-12-31 21:52:00,6899,"Didn't go too far today but there is plenty of safe ice for about 100 yards out in front of my place but I didn't go any further, my sholder just won't take drilling too many holes. Guess I'm starting to feel my age LOL"
