Most stuff was for parties this past week, some was for my own use.  3 smokers doin' their thing, It's a dang lotta work tending 3 wood fires ( no wannabe girlie-assed electric or gas smokers here==if you're gonna do it..do it right! )    7 racks of ribs:   3 turkey breasts:   4 stuffed sausage rolls:   Smoked squash-WONDERFUL taste!!     And, a big ol' roaster full of rigatoni ( Sausage & hamburg smoked before mixing)   Kinda glad the Holiday is over, now,on to ripping part of the rodshop up & revampng the work area... It'll soon be an IMPORTANT Holiday....spring FISHING SEASON"

651058,esoxansteel,2011-12-26 20:23:00,1307,Have you ever tried smokin cheese?  yummy
651060,misfish,2011-12-26 20:33:00,29133,"Drooooooool.  Nice vettles there, thats for sure."
651072,Pikeslayer8,2011-12-26 22:18:00,336,"Rodwrap,  Very nice form, squash looked amazing.  What was the sausage stuffed with?  Looks like you were cooking for an army.  I did a smoked prime rib, smoked twice baked potatoes, fire roasted veggies.           "
651074,Billy Bob,2011-12-26 22:35:00,5865,"Rodwrap, NICE.....and I agree....real men use real wood to smoke with...  Pikeslayer8, how long did you smoke the twice backed potatoes ? ? ?...they  look good enough to lick the screen....  Bob"
651076,Pikeslayer8,2011-12-26 22:49:00,336," Rodwrap, really love your smokers.   Do you ever hang your ribs vertically in them?  Not wanting to hijack your thread but us foodies do get passionate on what we produce.  Billy Bob,  the prime cooks for 35 minites on each side and I pulled it off with a internal temp of 105.  We like our cow rare.  Left the twice baked on for about an hour.  It was very easy.  I also smoke mashed potatoes the same way.  Yes, they were really yummy.  Lick the screen, lol, thank you."
651087,Rodwrap,2011-12-27 01:01:00,130,"The only limit as to what's inside the sausage rolls is your imiganation. These have diced tomatoes, onions, peppers, pepperoni,bbq sauce, & cheddar cheese.  a couple twists are...  anything you would put on a pizza...  a cooked ( ball park, in the US) hotdog with texas sauce & onions with some mustard.  a cooked pancake With some scrambled eggs...a little maple syrup drizzled over the top..  use hamburg...stuff with american cheese..slice for "" cheeseburger"" sammiches..  dream it up & smoke it.."
651090,bubbles,2011-12-27 01:16:00,591,"I did a turkey and a roast yesterday, turned out fantastic!"
651093,Pikeslayer8,2011-12-27 01:20:00,336," Have you ever wrapped it with a bacon weave?        In Iowa, where I'm from its called a fattie.   Just seems with your handle it would be a natural.  And I mean the wrapping part, not the fattie.  Lol"
651096,Rodwrap,2011-12-27 01:35:00,130,"Yep...FATTIE it is... I do the bacon weave when I want to ""impress""  somebody...too much work for the general public..."
652646,fishdawg,2012-01-02 15:49:00,912," perhaps your reffering to the bacon explosion? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon_Explosion i did it last year for Super Bowl in my Bradley Smoker  over the holidays ive done some various varieties of cheese, as well as ribs & trout  this past fall I put a smoke vent in the garage to make things a little more convenient"
652656,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-02 16:36:00,336,"Hey fishdawg, love your term bacon explosion.  I made this on Friday      Took me awile to get over my bacon and sausage coma.    "
652664,kickingfrog,2012-01-02 16:59:00,8333,Oh what wonders are contained under that Bacon?

652671,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-02 17:11:00,336,"I formed a Jimmy Dean sausage crust and filled it with provolone cheese, hash brown potatoes, frozen corn/bean blend, frozen pepper/mushroom blend.  Plenty of high powered hot sauce.  Was delicious."
