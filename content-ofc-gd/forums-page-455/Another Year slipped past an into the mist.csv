652203,mercman,2011-12-31 18:41:00,7054,"Just cant believe how fast this year passed. I always get a bit retrospective this time of the year.I look back over the year, and filter out all the good things that happened, and embrace and accept all the bad things before discarding them. I am then left with good memories to help start the new year. I wish each and every one of you a Healthy and Happy New Year. My only resolution, if you can call it that, is to do my best to slow down my life. To appreciate every second of it,good or bad, and try to live each day to the fullest.  "

652357,Rod Caster,2012-01-01 12:41:00,5784,"I was DD for probably the first time ever. I must be getting frugal with age because I couldn't imagine paying 50 for the cab or waiting two hours for it, and there was NO chance I was drinking and driving. Forget that, I just won't drink and I'll hold focused conversations with myself. It actually feels good to buck the trend and not participate in a worldwide hangover. I'm going fishing today, fresh as a daisy. Happy new year"
652359,spincast,2012-01-01 12:47:00,3279,"Happy New Year all, may 2012 bring you good health and fat fish.    - only 12 weeks left till the boat gets a sping service - maybe less if it stays this warm. Hopefull the late arrival of winter wont mean a late departure."
