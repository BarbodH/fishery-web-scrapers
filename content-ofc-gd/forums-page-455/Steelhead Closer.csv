652273,Twocoda,2011-12-31 22:12:00,4130,Good for you....years from now youll reflect back to the weather on this day while your standing in the river with 3 feet of snow built up on your shoulders....by then you will be well on your way to having steelhead knowledge and passing out tips to newbies like handing out candies to trick or treaters....your off to a good start...Happy New Years  It was my intentions to stand in the river today too....but someones water heater blew up and someone answered the phone
652304,rocheleauc,2011-12-31 23:48:00,205,awesome!  second one is a fatty
652343,kingofthesteelhead,2012-01-01 04:02:00,140,steelhead fishing is never closed out east of pickering it is open all year round and can be deadly in the winter months!
652346,FieroLuke,2012-01-01 05:49:00,24,"Good job  Is it me or does that fat hen look like a squaretail. I swear that looks like a fresh brown trout hen. The tail is a bit folded so I cannot be 100% sure  Either way, beauty fish!"
652347,FieroLuke,2012-01-01 05:53:00,24,"Twocoda, same happened to me except in reverse, I was about to get out for the closer of my favourite stretch and my real estate agent called me to tell me it was only 38F in my house in the kawarthas. I spent 12 hours there, got home just before new years"
652905,mikeseb,2012-01-03 15:33:00,201, Yea? i was thinking it might have been a brown aswell which would be sweet as ive never landed one before.  Either way it was a great way to end the year!
