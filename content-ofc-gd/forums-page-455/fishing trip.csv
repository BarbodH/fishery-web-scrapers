652546,notvincent,2012-01-02 03:34:00,25,One of my friends suggested we go on a fishing trip as soon as the ice melts.  He had suggested Cedar lake in Algonquin and said he had been there at that time and the fishing was great.  However the trip would take 4-5 and my dad doesn't wan't me missing more than one day of school.  So now I have to find a lake or river that is closer (I live in Mississauga).  Does anyone know of any great fishing places that we could go to and catch walley.
