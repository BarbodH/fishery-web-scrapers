652820,Aaron Shirley,2012-01-03 03:35:00,655,"I got out a few times for steeies in December, and it was pretty good fishing for the most part. I will not be making too many more trib trips until spring. Niagara bound and the hard water for a while for me.. when the ice firms up that is lol.  Enjoy the pics. Sorry for the blackout in some pics, it's a prototype rod that I can't show anyone yet.                        "
652827,blaque,2012-01-03 03:53:00,2419,Nice job guys. I've been out many days in the last 2 weeks and had some great days and some DUDS lol
652854,solopaddler,2012-01-03 10:40:00,8605,It has been a good season hasn't it? The best in years for me.  (I think it's time to retire that hat of mine LOL!)   Here's one you may not have seen yet:  
652864,mikeseb,2012-01-03 12:44:00,201,Way to go! Those are some nice fish
652871,OnTheFly,2012-01-03 14:01:00,14,"Nicely done guys. ""Prototype"" you say--is it like, uhmmm, your line running through the middle of the blank or something, maybe a light-sabre rod??!! Cool."
652950,Aaron Shirley,2012-01-03 20:22:00,655,"Ya Mike, it has been a good year. I wish I could have got out more than I did. My heavy work schedule blows. I didn't know you took that pic. I'd like to see the one with my pack on my head lol.  OnThe Fly, it is a high-end prototype rod that I can't show yet. It may change a bit, as it's in it's early development.  I can say this; it's the nicest blank that I've fished since my IMX."
652952,strakey,2012-01-03 20:31:00,78,Nice pictures guys. Mike certainly has a nack for finding fish. He has his own gps of sorts. Those brownies are gorgeous.  
652980,solopaddler,2012-01-03 21:37:00,8605,  
652994,Aaron Shirley,2012-01-03 21:56:00,655,"That's pretty funny, but it would have been even funnier if you snapped a pic when the water was only a couple inches from the top of my waders lol"
653018,BillM,2012-01-03 22:26:00,17367,That's a fun walk
653059,msp,2012-01-04 00:14:00,1336,"Not really ! Especially when the water reaches your thermometer.  Nice fish guys, looks as if the steelheaders had a great fall"
653084,OnTheFly,2012-01-04 01:39:00,14," WELL DO KEEP US INFORMED AARON, would love to give it a drift."
653086,OnTheFly,2012-01-04 01:45:00,14, IMX over GLX? Reasons?? Just curious.
653087,justin elia,2012-01-04 01:49:00,151, Good times!  That day was a blast!
653095,BillM,2012-01-04 02:20:00,17367," Absolutely, have you ever fished a GLX?  I'd take a IMX over it any day."
653111,OnTheFly,2012-01-04 03:13:00,14, Your vote has been counted--thanks B
653112,OnTheFly,2012-01-04 03:23:00,14, IMX faster than GLX?? Is it preference only?? How would you rate the IMX (no longer in 13 foot) over the RV9??
653117,BillM,2012-01-04 03:31:00,17367," Never fished the RV9..  GLX feels like it goes completely parabolic when you get into a fish, like you can feel it into the handle..  Really mushy.. It's just an odd rod (I fished a factory with the recoils)  I like soft rods like the IMX which is nice and slow up top then gradually grows some balls in the bottom end..  Very similar to my Loomis IM6.."
653120,OnTheFly,2012-01-04 03:39:00,14, Good report-thanks!
