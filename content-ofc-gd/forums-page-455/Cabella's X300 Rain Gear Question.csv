652379,hirk,2012-01-01 14:17:00,571,To hot. The bps pro qualifier is not insulated but is designed with a zip in liner (purchased seperately) that gives you the best of warm and cold weather gear.Or get a bigger non-insulated and bundle up?
652393,kickingfrog,2012-01-01 15:46:00,8333,I vote for non insulated as well. It's more versatile.

Nice & light for summer use but I got a size too large  and throw on a sweater when the weather gets nasty.  No complaints whatsoever."
652425,mike rousseau,2012-01-01 18:27:00,4661,Non insulated...  I have the cabelas guidewear x300 bibs and parks uninsulated...  You can wear it year round...  Ive been wearing mine the past 3 days on the ice as well... Just need the right layers underneath...  And it was good in the summer as well...  Keep in mind if it's 25 degres or warmer wearing any rain suit will be hot...
