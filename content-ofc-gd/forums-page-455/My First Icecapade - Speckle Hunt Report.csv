652537,Joeytier,2012-01-02 02:57:00,3990,You da man!  Probably the best possible way to spend a cold winters day.
652538,Leecher,2012-01-02 02:59:00,7832, Thanks my man!!!  It sure is    Nothing like a fresh feed of specks on ice
652689,Leecher,2012-01-02 18:06:00,7832,"Was a total wash this morning    Slushville   Needless to say, trip was cut short after driving in blizzard condition  Next weekend I guess"
651994,Leecher,2011-12-31 01:37:00,7832,"Man    or gosh darn like Roy would say Been waiting for this a long long time and today was the day The little beauties were on the feed    I went 4 for 10   on only 1 rod    and to top it off.... the one that had my new reel  Not the biggest but all were in the 12"" range    and verocious Biggest was 12 3/4""   didn't have to use my salties  But first the details... left late around 9ish, 2 pit stops (Tims and gas) and the way I go   Temps were -14C, slight wind from the east and overcast... snow had started to fall down  I was anxious to get there... to see how much ice was on the lake... to my surprise, when I arrived, a local was already fishing and had his ATV on the ice    I stopped to talk and gather some crucial info... ice was 6"" to 7"" inches thick... Perfect  So I proceed to the other end of the lake so as to not bother the local... my arrival time    and my spot to myself    Someone had already punched holes for me     So I proceeded to install 2 rods... not a minute went by and my first line gets some serious attention    and get my first speck on ice WHOO HOO!!!!    Then the other rod gets attention too... I set the hook and reel in but all of sudden... nothing     I check the jig and the hook had been straighten   and the grub and 1"" Gulp shad was gone  WOW I couldn't believe that I miss this thing    ah well, it happens  Not long after and get my second   but it was a fiesty one, it slipped my grip Oppps!!!    Under control now    I've never seen a speckle female so full of roe    She was spitting it everywhere      My third and fourth in a row      I was quite pleased at this point and decided to pack it in when a few locals gather around my spot   but it was time to go  My wife needed the car and it was getting really overcast, I could feel a storm coming looking over the east above the tree line    The bait of choice today was 1/8oz jig with power grub tip with 1"" Gulp shad and Mr. Champ tip with Gulp fish fry in white  All in all was a great time!!!  Until next time Tight lines Leechman  P.S.  made a little video for your peruse since my daughter bought me the Nickelback CD for Christmas ""Here and Now""  Enjoy the tune!!!  <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvid732.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fww321%2Fleechman1%2FIce%2520Fishing%25202011%2FSpeckle%2520Hunt%2520-%2520Dec%252030%25202011%2FIceFishingDec302011.mp4"">"
