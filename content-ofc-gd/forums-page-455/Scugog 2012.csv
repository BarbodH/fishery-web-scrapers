We are on a weed line in 5 fow 300' from shore.  Last winter was our worst yet, and the summer was not any better.  I tried suggestions, Erie deery along weedlines, shallower water, deeper, the other end of the lake etc.  I live on the east side of the lake so I know where the contours and weeds are.  I also have the advantage of being able to fish at dusk.  I used to catch pickeral, have they changed that much?  Most people I talk to have had the same results as me, but others are catching more than ever. I'm begining to think that the people saying they are catching fish get kickbacks from the bait store for telling their stories.  PS, there are still lots of Bass in the lake"
