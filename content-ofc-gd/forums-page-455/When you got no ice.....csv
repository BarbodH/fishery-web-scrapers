Always manage some perch and pike. I've had one really big pike grab my perch a couple of times now. These are 9-10 perch he's grabbing, and this pike looks to easily be 4x as large. Even got it up to the dock, once, before he spit the perch. Sure messed up the perch.  Close up  These shore spots will dry up soon enough once the perch move out onto the flats beyond casting distance."
652521,uglyfish,2012-01-02 02:15:00,981,might be a good idea to toss on a live target perch and see if u can get that pike!
652522,Leecher,2012-01-02 02:18:00,7832,Right on Bruce    Sounds like some great excitement even though the lack of ice Thanks for sharing Jacques
652532,BillM,2012-01-02 02:53:00,17367,Put that perch on a livebait rig!
652535,Rizzo,2012-01-02 02:54:00,4754,could it be a musky instead of pike?
652536,mike rousseau,2012-01-02 02:57:00,4661,  I was thinking the same thing...  Musky slice like that... Pike bite marks aren't usually that clean...  And there are some serious musky in the niagra...

I've had a few, clean deep, pike slices  from big pike in my time. 6 stitches the one time. Another time we were back in the bush so we duct taped them shut. By the time I was back to a doctor they had sealed up nicely"
