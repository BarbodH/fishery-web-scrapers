519763,Devious,2010-11-14 01:25:00,49,"Got out fishing with my buddy Jeff today for the afternoon and we had a good outing.  It was a great day to be out on the water as it wasn't too cold nor windy. Fishing was tough for the first little while as we started off by tossing suicks but didn't get a sniff on them.  Throughout the afternoon we tried tossing a few other lures but didn't catch a break until the end of the day. As we were making out way back to the launch I got this one on a 12"" bulldog.    45 inches, I wish i would of got the girth measurement but what can ya do.  Fish swam off strong as soon as it got back in the water which was nice to see. Hopefully the weather is decent enough to get back out next weekend."
