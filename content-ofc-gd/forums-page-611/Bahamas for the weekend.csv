I fished from shore with a spinning rod and a good old jig and grub just like your regular walleye set up.  Caught all kinds of little critters right from the beach.  I imagine little crank baits would do quite well also.  Not that this helps a whole lot, but it worked for me!  Good luck and enjoy the trip!  Cheers, Ryan"
