520101,solopaddler,2010-11-15 13:39:00,8605,In case you guys don't know these lures are incredible! Hard to come by and a bit pricey...but worth it believe me.  Just unwrapped my package and am currently salivating over these babies.       
520108,ctranter,2010-11-15 13:54:00,543,"Looks like you got your hands on a nice little collection.  I was always the skeptic about pricey crankbaits until I start using some lucky craft this past summer.  What can I say?  The bass wouldn't leave them alone.  Did you find a retailer in that just got a shipment or something?  I know megabass tackle is usually pretty rare in the GTA, especially if you want variety.  Do they all rattle? edit: Im assuming ""quiet griffons"" are just that... quiet."
520111,OhioFisherman,2010-11-15 13:59:00,6623,"http://bassdozerstore.blogspot.com/2010/10/megabass-griffon-6cc-compact-crankbait.html  I have fished with a lot of guys using a lot of different lures, the fact that theirs had a Cadillac price didn`t equate to the catching more fish."
520116,solopaddler,2010-11-15 14:09:00,8605," No local retailer, had to buy them online. And yeah the quiet ones have no rattles...     In general I agree with you, but 4 times recently I had my   handed to me by a buddy throwing these baits for steelhead. The proof as they say is in the pudding.  (They are deadly baits for steelhead)  You do have to replace the small rear treble with a beefier #6 or you'll lose fish though."
520118,EC1,2010-11-15 14:23:00,930,"I got myself a Griffon Zero over the summer, but didn't have too much luck throwing it. Good to hear they are actually really good for other people though. I think I'll have to try again next year with them harder.  BTW, that looks like a good 200 dollar splurge! Lots of colours!"
520121,steverowbotham,2010-11-15 14:36:00,1800,I throw the Griffons quite a bit.  Megabass has a phenominal line up.  The PopMax and Anthrax are a couple favourites as well
520127,4x4bassin,2010-11-15 14:51:00,1025,"Those are some nice baits ,I bet you can't wait too use them ! I have some ""Pop Max"" baits and they are great , some days you can't keep the bass off them !!! They are expensive though but worth it and they don't touch pike waters for obvious reasons , just bass lakes . Any luck with those cranks for bass or just steelhead ?"
520134,johnnyb,2010-11-15 15:13:00,3413,"  So you use them for steelhead....this is making a lot more sense now   ""Megabass"" and ""Solopaddler"" just didn't seem to go together in my head.  Are these another option for ""froggy"" water....or do you back them into pools a la ""hotshot"" technique?"
520153,solopaddler,2010-11-15 16:19:00,8605, Well actually they will be used for Bass as well.  But right now as mentioned for steelhead. Not necessarily in frogwater either.  They dive 6-7' and generally you're bumping the lip off rocks and occasionally stopping and letting them float up.  Many of the hits are coming as the lure is floating up.  They're a very tiny subtle bait with a very pronounced wobble. They cast incredibly well and are an excellent excellent bait for triggering strikes from inactive steelhead.
520179,scuro2,2010-11-15 17:02:00,904,"Solo, what is the length and weight of that lure?"
520187,solopaddler,2010-11-15 17:22:00,8605," 13/4"", 1/4oz"
520211,asdve23rveavwa,2010-11-15 18:21:00,2690,"  Now you're talking my language Mike...much as I love getting chrome on the drift, feeling that strike on hardware is hard to beat.  Nice looking lures!!"
520279,Leecher,2010-11-15 22:28:00,7832,Never heard of those before Mike.... sweet looking lures for sure   and if you say they're good for steelies I believe you Leechman
520287,canadadude,2010-11-15 22:59:00,769,"Do you use these the same way as the old Hot-Shots, I use to love bumping them down the pools for steelies, man you could trigger some explosive hits."
520297,OhioFisherman,2010-11-15 23:29:00,6623,"I used the Storm Wee Steelie Warts, they are no longer made, the only difference I could see between them and the regular Wee Warts was a bigger stronger hook, which also made them a great bass lure.  You can still find them on ebay but the west coast steelhead fisherman and collectors do drive the price up. Still usually cheaper than the megabass."
