I googled the route and have some alternatives. I was just wondering if anyone on the board knows the route and has some recommendations/things to look out for.   We intend to leave TO at 6 a.m. tomorrow morning.  Also any midway stops for sites, shopping etc would be approeciated.  Thanks  Nemo"

518943,DanD,2010-11-10 19:19:00,2223,Not much out of the way but Gettysburg has a lot to see; that’s if you’re into things that deal with the US Civil war. Not sure if everything would be open at this time of year (actual battle fields); we went mid summer and that was a number of years ago. At least 25 years; there might be condos there now If it’s anything like it was I could have spent a bunch more time there.  Dan.

518993,greenfshrmn,2010-11-10 22:51:00,65,"I used to fish Lake Gaston in Va every spring. From Whitby, I crossed the border at the Ivy Lea bridge east of Kingston and then it was straight down I-81.  Took about 12 hours to reach DC.  Mapquest will show a shorter route via Buffalo that will also get you to Gettysburg in about 2 hours less time.  Other than Gettysburg, there's not a lot of places to visit on the way there.  Of course, D.C. has all kinds of interesting places.  Be careful of driving in the city, they don't hang around ..it pays to have a good navigator sitting beside you!  Have fun."
518996,aplumma,2010-11-10 23:12:00,6896,A GPS like Tom Tom is your friend. The Gettyburg war area is full of rich history you will also find that Bullrun is also a nice area if you are a war buff. The air and space museum out near Dulles Airport is worth a look if time is available. You will find that if you want to get a map of the Metro trains before you leave it will save you a lot of wear and tear driving. The out lying area are usually much cheaper to stay at than downtown D.C.. The final place that is very nice in the fall and is a neat place is Luray Caverns.   Art

520321,Nemo,2010-11-16 01:02:00,727,"Hi All,  Trip to DC went very well. Weather in the 60's and sunny.  Smithsonian, Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, White House, Vietnam Memorial etc.  The drive down was 9 hrs 15 mins. The return trip was 8hrs 30mins.  The GPS worked great. No map on board. It took us door to door.  Also useful for finding sites in DC itself.  Thanks for all the help.  Nemo"
