520217,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-15 18:32:00,4399,  Yes and what a great player you were squid!!!
520227,anders,2010-11-15 18:59:00,1168,"Versteeg also played on a cup winning team which was so good it made Nick Boynton look like a top 2 defenceman.  Versteeg is a good player...NOT GREAT...and never will be...will he have a good career, sure, don't doubt that in the least.  is he a first liner...No, is he a second liner...only if someone is hurt he is.  Remember, other than fighters in the league, players are drafted because they are good or have some sort of talent and 90% of them have or had a excellent positioning.  Versteeg is nothing special."
520232,addy79,2010-11-15 19:16:00,573,"Im over it.  Not gonna get into a pissing contest about hockey resumes with ppl that played junior 40 years ago. I've got an impressive resume as well, but it sure doesnt date back to 70's!  You're all elite hockey geniuses! Pat yourselves on the back...  Versteeg is a great player, end of discussion.  Go Leafs Go!"
520235,ctranter,2010-11-15 19:25:00,543,"  Intelligent discussions about the game of hockey ended pages ago.  Now it's just mud-slinging, personal attacks on fans, outlandish claims about players with little to no factual support, and ""experiential knowledge"" from ASHL prostars."

519461,addy79,2010-11-12 20:19:00,573," Well Put!! Prediction: Versteeg gets 65 Points this season. Hes a great player, give him time."
519502,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-12 22:38:00,4399, When did he become a great player? I think you have to become a good player before a great player!
519504,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-12 22:44:00,4399, He`ll probably get a goal and an assist his first game and beat Vancouver and the Leaf faithful will pronounce him a great player and they`ll all be jumpin back on the bandwagon!

519522,Rod Caster,2010-11-12 23:18:00,5784,  I admit I was against the leafs talk at first...but it's hard not to contribute to such a lively discussion. We should have a rule where there has to be at least one fish photo per page.

Does anyone know what the longest losing streak of the laffs is? I'm guessing they are not close yet but stand a chance of beating it with the team they have now.   Is it just me or does Burke look about 40 yrs older than he did 12 games ago"
519858,uglyfish,2010-11-14 15:17:00,981,"Kadri played a good game. That line of kadri, bozak and kulemin played very well together.  Giguere let in a weak goal that cost them the game.  Kaberle and lebda again should be benched."
519888,craigdritchie,2010-11-14 16:57:00,1586,"Allow me to correct myself.  Now that the Loafs have dropped EIGHT straight, and lost - ahem - 11 of their last 12 games ........  In the words of Tom Petty: Freeee fallin'"

But I live in the GTA, and it's all people around me talk about - even on internet fishing boards.  That's one reason I can't help snickering when I hear Loaf fans get all excited when they win a game or two. Loafs started the season by apparently winning three games in a row. People all over the GTA were talking about playoff match-ups. I mean, it's only  three games into the season. But they weren't joking - they were perfectly serious. Talk about desperate.  Loaf fans make me laugh. What more can I say?"

520145,addy79,2010-11-15 15:51:00,573," Have you ever even played?? house league dont count! Some of your comments are way off... His fundamentals are stellar, as is his nose for the puck. Chemistry with his linemates will come.  my 2 cents"
520155,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-15 16:20:00,0,"I think Brain is right. Kadri played well but he was manhandled. The leafs over all played great. The only difference being that their goalie outplayed our goalie(seems to be a common theme). Simple as that.  Still, we can improve on our man to man coverage in our end. People are scoring because they are being left all alone in front of the net."
520197,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-15 17:41:00,4399," You know what in your opinion Versteeg is a great player thats your opinion and your entilted to it. IMHO greatness is something you earn and frankly I have not seen anything in his play that convinces me of his greatness.  BTW for what it`s worth I did play but was more into coaching advanced level, coached many young players that went on to play various levels of Junior hockey and NCAA including a couple that were NHL drafted."
520207,Squid,2010-11-15 18:19:00,1656,"The LAFFS are playing peripheral hockey right now especially Versteeg and (LOL) Kessel. They need to get dirty in order to score goals and they don't want to because it would impact their off ice modelling contracts, pretty faces and all."
520209,addy79,2010-11-15 18:20:00,573," than apparently you didnt watch his performaces last season, OR the year before for that matter. Most coaches I've worked with would agree 100%. He has a great eye for the puck, his positioning is excellent...  He finished his first full season in the show he with 22 goals and 53 points! second in rookie scoring to Bobby Ryan, he was nominated for the Calder Trophy  Sometimes getting acclimated to a new team, a new system and new linemates comes easy, and on other teams there's a learning curve. Kris Versteeg is too good to maintain this current pace..."
520213,Squid,2010-11-15 18:24:00,1656,"That's because Versteeg had talent to play with which is in short supply in TO. Here is the latest ranking from the national post Nov 15th, 2010.  Here at Posted Sports, we figure it’s better to get a somewhat clearer view of the picture before prognosticating.  That’s why the first edition of our 2010-11 NHL Rankings is coming to you a little more than a month into the season. We just figure nobody needs to see the Toronto Maple Leafs at No. 4. Cough.  So what have we learned through the first six weeks of the schedule? Well, West is still best and the Maple Leafs, Islanders and Oilers still aren’t very good.  For the rest of the season, look for the Posted Sports NHL Rankings every Monday morning at 9 a.m. ET. And without further ado, your new No. 1:  1. Los Angeles Kings (12-3-0) Scarier than their record: Drew Doughty scored his first goal on Saturday vs. NYI.  2. Washington Capitals (12-4-1) Offence still unquestionable. Without Varlamov, goaltending still a major issue.  3. Philadelphia Flyers (11-4-2) Core locked up after Claude Giroux and Jeff Carter signed extensions this week.  4. Detroit Red Wings (11-3-1) Norris at 40? Nicklas Lidstrom has 17 points in 15 games.  5. Vancouver Canucks (10-4-2) Gave up nothing to get healthy scratch Keith Ballard and it was still too much.  6. Montreal Canadiens (11-5-1) Carey Price currently unfamiliar with the word “pressure.”  7. St. Louis Blues (9-3-3) Two losses in two games without leading scorer T.J. Oshie (broken ankle).  8. Boston Bruins (8-5-1) Eleven goals in four games have ballooned Tim Thomas’s GAA to 1.45.   9. Anaheim Ducks (10-7-1) Ryan Getzlaf has seven goals on just 29 shots (24%). He should shoot more.  10. San Jose Sharks (8-5-2) Ditto Joe Thornton, who has six goals on 20 shots (30%).  11. Pittsburgh Penguins (9-8-1) Sidney Crosby has 12 points in his past five games.  12. Ottawa Senators (9-7-1) Brian Elliott once again rendering Pascal Leclaire irrelevant.   13. Columbus Blue Jackets (9-6-0) No goals in 15 games for Russian enigma Nikita Filatov.  14. Tampa Bay Lightning (8-6-2) Have lost five of six — and big centre Vincent Lecavalier (broken hand).  15. Phoenix Coyotes (7-5-5) Just one goal in 15 games for top flight forward Wojtek Wolski.  16. Chicago Blackhawks (8-9-2) Brian Campbell’s return will boost shaky defence, offence.  17. Colorado Avalanche (8-7-1) Top three scorers — Stewart, Stastny and Hejduk — are a collective minus-13.  18. Nashville Predators (7-5-3) All-world defenceman Shea Weber sporting ugly minus-8 rating.  19. New York Rangers (8-7-1) Can Brandon Dubinsky maintain a hot start for once?  20. Dallas Stars (8-7-0) Strange: Mike Ribeiro averaging near a point per game … with zero goals.  21. Atlanta Thrashers (7-7-3) Dustin Byfuglien, Andrew Ladd thriving minus Blackhawks’ all-stars.  22. Minnesota Wild (7-6-2) Niklas Backstrom — 2.06 GAA, .930 SV% — back on all-star form.  23. Florida Panthers (7-8-0) Weiss, Olesz and Frolik still struggling to put it all together.  24. Carolina Hurricanes (8-9-0) Jeff Skinner — 15 pts. in 17 games — looks 12, plays like he’s 28.  25. Buffalo Sabres (6-9-3) Ryan Miller fantasy owners are cursing the day.  26. Calgary Flames (7-9-0) The Sutters’ Frankenstein is what we thought it was.  27. New Jersey Devils (5-10-2) How long before we regularly use the expression “Kovalchuk Curse?”  28. Toronto Maple Leafs (5-8-3) Boston’s sprint to the first overall pick in 2011 is on.  29. Edmonton Oilers (4-8-3) On the bright side, only two more seasons of Nikolai Khabibulin.  30. New York Islanders (4-10-3) Garth Snow era starting to look like Mike Milbury era."
520215,Squid,2010-11-15 18:26:00,1656,"Speaking of playing hockey, how far up the chain did you make it to when you were playing Addy79? I managed to play Junior B and then College hockey for the Dawson Blues in Montreal back in the 70's. Lookingforwalleye was my coach....."
519175,lhousesoccer,2010-11-11 15:46:00,442,"Burke and Wilson need to get their   kicked to the curb as a pair.  It's the only thing that will set the Leafs on a better path to the future, which is still a long way off.  I was born in 1969 and raised as a Leafs fan (Habs second, thanks to Grandfather on mother's side    thanks Grandpa!).  I'm only 41.  There's still a chance I might see a cup in my lifetime.  I feel for fellow Leafs fans that are over 60"
519180,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-11 16:01:00,0," Bozo can't win a faceoff? That's why they are 5th in the league!  Thanks to Bozak and partly Zigomanis.  I've said it before. Kessel has no one anywhere near his calibre to play with, though Bosak has shown great promise. But our most productive line is the Kuleimen line......  Kessel definitely needs some help. PHaneuf and Kaberle gotta go, and if Armstrong doesn't pic up his game when he comes back, he should go too."
519185,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-11 16:12:00,0," My brother hates both Burke and Wilson. He doesn't trust Americans running a Canadian hockey team.lol The draft game is all about getting lucky and having good scouts. The leafs dont seem to have those. Kessel is a proven goal scorer but lacks support. Crosby, Ovechkin, Toews, ALL have support.  Burke said he would build his team up from the goalie and up. We have some goaltending, we have some defense but the Phaneuf trade was a bomb. Now he needs to get some goal scorers.  We are a couple of trades away from a good team. Maybe not a stanley cup team, but team that will not only make the playoffs, but have a good run.  To me the problem is definitely coaching. The biggest problem right now being lack of scoring(which I believe will pick up) and man to man coverage in our end(horrible). They look like chickens running around with their heads cut off."
519189,ctranter,2010-11-11 16:42:00,543,"The Canadian in me agrees with this, but there's a reason these guys were 1 and 2 in the US hockey program in the 2010 Olympics.  Remember the guys that put together and coached a team that roflstomped Canada in the round robin and made us crap our pants with just seconds to go in the finals?  There's a reason they have highly distinguished careers. Remember the team that we had before Burkey came in?  At least this team doesn't make the bile in my stomache turn.  They might be losing, clearly slumping, and deflated, but at least they have character.  Exactly.  Keep in mind that it's easy to look back in hindsight at certain events and make claims about decisions.  Say the leafs kept their 1st round pick, there is no guarantee that they would get the top pick for Hall or Seguin.  They would be guaranteed a solid player, but it's still a lottery.   I agree, but don't expect those ""couple of trades"" to come easily or quickly.  I believe that there is interest in certain players on the leaf roster.  The leafs D core (which isn't turning out to have chemistry) is still comprised of many proven vets that tons of teams would love to have.  Still, don't expect anything until the deadline, and prepare for this current squad to shoulder the majority of this season's record.   Ron Wilson will get the job done.  The lack of scoring comes from lack of talent, plain and simple.  My concern is that Wilson tends to be a defensive-system coach, and I'm not seeing coordination or consistency from the D at all."
519192,Rod Caster,2010-11-11 16:48:00,5784,"  Ok, Bozo has good numbers overall...I watched yesterday and he was brutal.  You should be coach Johnny Bass.... the senators could use more fans."
519209,John,2010-11-11 18:09:00,2956," I don't necessarily agree Brian. Letting your best young talent ""serve their time"" in the minors is a archaic way of thinking. Burkie has spent waaay to much money and given up waaay too much in draft choices for second and third line players and will never admit to a mistake. Wilson needs to realize ""it's broken"" and make some radical changes to the line up even if that means making some of the overpaid undermotivated buffoons take a spell riding the pine and give some of the young un's an opportunity to shine..  Just sayin'"
519213,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-11 18:31:00,4399,"  Crosby,OV and Toews are in a different class than Kessel."
519225,John,2010-11-11 19:38:00,2956, Absolutely....
519234,bassmaster4,2010-11-11 20:29:00,801,"The leafs team that we are watching right now are not the same, in the first four games they were confident making good passes and getting shots through to the net! They need to do that again they have made the game way too complicated with their stretch passes, that have resulted in countless give aways and countless odd man rushes. Also they need to start one timing again, am i the only one who noticed that when they are set up in the offensive zone when they receive a pass it is almost as if they wait for everyone on the defensive side to get in position to either block the shot or poke check it away from them. BRING BACK THE ONE TIMERS AND GET BODIES IN FRONT OF THE NET and the team will be back on track. Also dont make stupid passes. IMO the problem is not with the coaching staff or the management its the team itself making bad choices of how they play the game. The playoffs are still a long time away so all those habs and sens fans dont get too cozy in your playoff spots because you never know what will happen besides we beat you both. Bassmaster 4 GO LEAFS GO"
519237,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-11 20:39:00,0," If only! I'd rather by GM.lol I'd bring a cup home for sure!    True, but give him a few good players to play with and I think he has the potential to be an 80+ point scorer."
519253,muskymatt,2010-11-11 21:39:00,2608,"Any way you look at it the laffs are the most pathetic excuse for a hockey team and continue to be an embarassment to the league, players and management.  They are so bad I almost feel sorry for them but for the arrogance of the fans I hope they suck nightly...and they never disappoint.  The complete lack of the fans to recognize the brutality is comical at best.  If the fans actually weren't a bunch of team puppets they might be able to change the direction of the team by refusing to support the garbage being stuffed down their throats by the team....  But they (the laffs) will keep sucking, the fans will keep going to the games and jokes the likes of furgeson and burke will be portrayed as knight is shining armour only to disappoint once again.  going for the 11th loss in a row and still sucking."
519262,bassmaster4,2010-11-11 21:54:00,801,"musky matt you really seem to like to rip the leafs up is it because we have a better history than your team?  or because we have knocked your beloved sens out of the playoffs countless times? it seems that your dislike of the leafs goes beyond the make up of the organization, its what our organization has done to yours in the past!"

519280,muskymatt,2010-11-11 22:50:00,2608,"  I used to be a leaf fan...a huge leaf fan at that.  I put in my time...almost 30 yrs cheering for nothing. A move to Ottawa and a new team, it wasn't a hard decision. Heck I still would cheer for the laffs if they were th only Canadian team left in the playoffs.  I got tired of all the stupidy of the organization and havn't looked back...the sens are a classy organization and have put out to give the team a good product. Look at the finishes they have had in the last 10 yrs...impressive.  The leaf managemant woould be well served to give a decent product to the fans."
519283,irishfield,2010-11-11 22:52:00,26272,They'd be a lot classier.. if they'd get rid of Alfredson.. just sayin..

Sundin tried to do that and the fans bood him out of town.  Add to that Alfie pissed off leaf nation....I think he should be knighted..."
519294,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-11-11 23:10:00,0,ya.  we'd be a lot better off without the longest serving captain in the nhl... a guy who may end up in the HHOF.  now if you had said kovalev i might have agreed.

519346,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-11-12 03:16:00,0,we don't have to.  we know the habs fans will do plenty of talking!
519410,Chance,2010-11-12 16:18:00,420," Admitting you are a frustrated Leafs fan is the first step,good for you.Not to worry you are not alone we are all frustrated with them.On the other hand to say Alfredson is the best example of a franchise player who LEADS by example...welll..thats just funny and gives an insight into your overall hockey knowledge.He is a decent player without a doubt but hardly a role model. A good example of his ""non leadership"" abilities can be found here   Elimination game and you wave your stick at a season ending goal.Not much of a franchise player leading by example,then again they have been following that early exit example for years. You want players that lead by example,take a look at brendan shanahan,mark messier,steve yzerman,joe sakic,henri richard,jean béliveau... those are a small sampling of guys that lead by example.  As Leaf fans we KNOW the Leafs suck right now.We HOPE for better in the future but dont necessarily expect it.So continue to point out the obvious but next time put a little bit of thought into it please."
519449,Rod Caster,2010-11-12 19:12:00,5784,"Kadri has been recalled to the team today.  They should recall the whole team...they sure seem defective.  sorry.  here is a Burke quote on Kadri:  ""I told him, you're not a savior here,"" said Burke. ""We brought you in to give us a spark and don't carry the weight of the world. The group has to turn this around -- 20 players have to fix this, not one player or two players."""
516392,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-31 17:31:00,0," Kessel has been opting to pass on the two on ones and his teamates are not connecting. I think Kessel should stop passing when he is one on one with the goalie. And for some reason, Wilson did not want to play Kessel on the power play. Bad coaching!"
516395,uglyfish,2010-10-31 18:02:00,981,"Perhaps the leafs should keep their feet moving all game, forecheck the hell outta their oponent like they did the 1st 5 games. Short quick passes up ice instead of tryin for the long stretch pass.  Send grabovski to the marlies and bring up a bucket of pucks for that useless waste of ice time and trade kaberle for anythin someone will give u for the biggest defensive liability on the leafs and worst player on the ice each game this season"
516409,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-31 19:27:00,0," For real! I think they throw 2 hits on a good night. Ever since that knock out, Orr hasn't been the same. What kind of checking line doesn't check? When they check, the crowd reacts and when you have the crowd behind you. Good things happen.  I wouldn't give up Kaberle, unless we get a consistent goal scorer/play maker. Phaneuf and Gabrovski, I'd trade them for a bag of chips."
516411,lookinforwalleye,2010-10-31 19:54:00,4399,aah nice to see things are back to normal in Leaf land!!!
516441,uglyfish,2010-10-31 21:43:00,981,"Lol funny how when the leafs lose a few and habs win a few, the ""fans"" come out to chirp. But when the habs spiral down and leafs start to win again, they will be nowhere to be found!  Also, how come u all pay more attention to a team u hate then ur own??"
516451,bassmaster4,2010-10-31 22:24:00,801,"thats only because they have nothing to cheer for in their own team just a bunch of pansies. Slumps are going to happen whether you like it or not. Im not making up any excuses for the leafs but they seem to be in a goal scoring slump. The habs on the other hand are on a hot streak thats all it is. Im sure the habs will be fighting for a playoff spot this year just as much as the leafs will, so keep on chirping well see who comes out on top when all is said and done."
516501,uglyfish,2010-11-01 02:22:00,981,"Lol true. Really, other then the game against the flyers, the leafs have outplayed their opponent. They've been gettin chances, just not being able to beat the goalies"
518509,misfish,2010-11-09 00:02:00,29133,"I think Wilson is the big damper here on the team. They were flying free style and doing as they pleased and winning.I think Wilson has said my way or the highway.He dosent like the open game.I say Wilson,you take the highway and let them play.  Me thinks he,s on his way out very soon."
518574,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-09 12:20:00,0," After that disgusting loss on Saturday? I think so. I was sick to my stomach when they scored that goal with 14 seconds left.  They should have been aggressively fore checking.They were fumbling the puck in the last 2 minutes of play big time. They just let them walts into their end and set up. That allowed their goalie to come out of the net also.  Not soon enough. He has to go now! He should have been gone years ago. Either he is really cheap or it is political.I'm surprised there wasn't severe booing! Its bad enough I started watching hockey again, but I will not be going to the AC center just to watch the leafs lose! Man we had that win in the bag! What a disappointment......."
518588,jbailey,2010-11-09 13:24:00,866,they really need to fork out the cash for another big name player up front - send Kaberle and Gab as a package.. i'm sure SOMEONE will take it..
518594,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-09 13:38:00,0, Kaberle and Phaneuf I want to trade for forwards.
518628,jughead,2010-11-09 15:47:00,92,"Are people really surprised by the leaves dropping back? Look at their line up. They have improved on defence (although their d-core is overrated) and have improved in net but their top six is the weakest top six in the NHL. Kessel is a good goal scorer but is a bit of a one-trick pony. Great speed, great release, won't go near a corner and won't plant in front of the net. Which is fine, he is what he is - but did people really expect Macarther to keep the pace he set, or Brent. Outside of Kessel their isn't a single top six player on the Leafs who would make the top six on just about every other team in the league. Their #1 centre is about 50 games into his career and while serviceable, sure as heck isn't a #1 centre in the NHL.  They are a bottom 5 team and will finish pretty much where they finished last year, which would be fine for Leaf fans if they were in the process of rebuilding correctly - see Chicago, Pittsburgh, Edmonton who although a work in progress will next year have Eberle, Hall, Paajarvi-Svensson, likely another top five pick this year along with a handful of good third and fourth year players.The difference between the Leafs and the Oilers is that the Oilers have some light at the end of the tunnel they are in."
518698,tb4me,2010-11-09 19:19:00,3295,"This is taken from mapleleafs.com, but I couldnt have said it any better so I stole it...lol Its in regards to Kadri, we need him NOW! Wilson is a hater and a hack.!  How many leaf forwards are adept two-way players?  Is Bozak? Brent? MacArthur, Kessel?  Versteeg was brought in because he was supposed to be responsible at both ends, he has 2 goals and is a -4.   point being you can't solely place the deficiencies or success of team defense on one guy.  Kadri may not be the best defensively but who is brave enough to argue he is not one of our top 3 forwards offensively?  He should be called up his skill is desperately needed here.  Team defense is just that team defense, if he is having problems picking up the philosophy I can't think of a better season to help him learn it.  We have probably the most expensive back end roster, if and when he makes a mistake we should have enough horses to help cover up those mistakes.  If a roster that has spent 27M on defenders and goalies can't help mask the mistakes of a rookie, then we have a completely different set of problems here..."
518708,misfish,2010-11-09 20:00:00,29133," Sorry to say,but Kadri is nowhere ready. I watched the last game he was in against the Sens farm team. He was being man handled and pushed of the puck like a peewee player.He,s got talent no dought,just needs to work on building strength."
518746,muskymatt,2010-11-09 22:12:00,2608,What more can ya say....  2-5-1-2  L-5  bwahahhaha....  And they will get pumped by Tampa tonight....
518814,muskymatt,2010-11-10 03:40:00,2608, What did I tell ya....lolololololol  1-6-1-2     .....     L-6     
518818,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-10 03:59:00,4399,"  What the Leafs lost,your kidding!!!"
518845,jediangler,2010-11-10 13:48:00,1923,"I bet they outplayed their opponents again   .  Ke$$el is going for a new record, he's gone 5 games without a point, his best is 6 games."
518862,craigdritchie,2010-11-10 14:51:00,1586,"So now that the Loafs have dropped six straight (and counting), what happened to all the giddy chatter about possible playoff match-ups, how many rounds they will go, and how THIS COULD BE THE YEAR???  Two months ago, that's all anyone would talk about - to the point it got to be nauseating.  And now ...... hmmm. Is that the sound of people diving off the bandwagon that I hear?  Again?  Good God, they even lost to the Senators. How pathetic is that?  I said it back in September when so many of you guys were busy planning the parade route - Leafs still suck, and once again, will go absolutely nowhere.  Just accept it and move on :-)"
518868,tb4me,2010-11-10 15:01:00,3295,"Well what better place to build? This is getting worse by the day. Let the kid learn with the big boys.I tought he did awesome in the preseason then wilson cut is ice time by 11 minutes so he could burry im in the minors.Wilson was Quoted as saying he (kadri) had a bad additude, come on Really? Lets hope Burke was able to get some trade chatter going at the GM's meeting yesterday.I honestly think Wilson has lost the team.Burke needs to seriously look into That too.Let the haters hate I suppose. Just for the record ill never jump off the wagon, there is way to much beer on it for me to leave"
518893,Headhunter,2010-11-10 16:29:00,5703,"Well, I'm back to living in familiar territory again! As I mentioned in an earlier post about the Leafs, I asked the haters to allows us leaf fans to enjoy the moment, as history has indicated that their success would be fleeting... and obviously it was! LOL The team seems to me anyway, to be lacking motivation. They come out of the dressing room for the beginning of the game and they all look totally dis-interested... but come the 3rd period, they are actually starting to skate... unfortunately by that point in the game, they are typically already way behind and struggling to get back in the game. I really have a hard time understanding how a professional athlete can have a difficult time getting motivated. They simply have to look at their bank deposit slips and that in itself, should be motivation! I think that they must be some sort of dis-connect between the coaching staff and the team... is it not the role of the coaches to get the team fired up for a game? During their ""fast start"", they out worked and out skated their opponents... haven't seen anything like that in the last number of games... Maybe they need some tough love? Maybe they need to have their cheques held for some time, to get them motivated or maybe, just maybe, we are once again seening the ugly ""I'm a Toronto Maple Leaf, so it doesn't matter what I do, everyone makes money"" syndrom we have been tarnished with for decades! it won't be long before the ""fans"" start booing players again and yah know what, I think it warranted... You pay you're dough, you get a say. Maybe that in of it's self, will get these guys motivated. the Marlies aren't far away, I'd be having cabs waiting outside the Ricoh Centre to send players back and forth! HH Ps... but it's still better than being a Sens fan! LMAO!"
519088,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-11 04:07:00,0," I was waiting for this.  We got out played by both Tampa and Florida. No question.  But I still think we have an ok team. It has to do with bad coaching and confidence.  We do the same mistakes over and over and the coach doesn't make the players aware? I finally seen some improvements in the Florida game but the man to man coverage in our defensive zone is horrible! In the tampa game I seen all 5 leafs chasing the puck and leaving their men. How they could keep Stavros in the clear is puzzling to me.  With Kessel is psychological. Every since that game in Boston that got into his head, he hasn't been the same.  Same thing with Orr. The checking line was doing great at the beginning of the season.Every since he got knocked out he has been played horrible. We have a checking line that doesn't check!!! FInally we seen some bodies flying in fLorida tonight.  Gustavson played well but let in a weak goal. A few soft penalties were called against the leafs tonight which led to two goals.Giguere was off to a great start in tampa making some great saves, but after the first it was all down hill. Why are they always on there knees?? Who is our goalie coach????Guigere also backed up to slow on the shoot out.  They finally improved their power play and were practicing one timers. They finally seen how other players score on one timers on the power pl ay. In the Tampa bgame they had a 5 on 3 aqnd they passed the puck for the entire power play. I was freaking out! ANd when they did shoot, they were so slow it would get blocked. Thats why most leaf shots are blocked. They wait to long to shoot the puck.  Even before the goal I was thinking Gabrovski has picked up his game. Lebda has alot of skill but he has to remember he is a defensemen not a forward. Komasarek and Schenn are our top defencemen.  Were on a major slump and the sad thing is we should have lost that game to Florida and it should be longer but we should have won that game in buffalo.  Anyways, thats my take"
519127,Squid,2010-11-11 13:16:00,1656,"Canada's Hockey team, Leafs Nation yeah right. The arrogance of the leafs organization sickens me. I feel for leaf fans everywhere, NOT!! GO HABS GO!!"
519132,Rod Caster,2010-11-11 13:23:00,5784,Disclaimer: Not a leafs fan.  Versteeg and kessel are just fine. They need a number one center yesterday. Bozo is too weak and can't win a faceoff. If the team had an inspiring first line the rest of the boys would buck up.  Sad to see them hit the ground hard after a good start.  Always cheer for the underdog is my philosophy.
519144,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-11 13:50:00,4399,"  While I am no fan of that arogant sourpuss Wilson I don`t believe Mr.Bass that he is the problem I will tell you what the problem ist he other arogant dude is your biggest problem Burke is so full of himself it`s scary. You look at all the teams that are starting to be competative and sucessful what is the common theme young highly drafted kids, just look at Pittsburgh,Washington,Chicago,Tampa etc. for the most part these teams were built with draft picks and the odd free agent thrown in for some depth. So along comes Mr.Burke and says I am smarter than everybody else and I don`t want be bad for 3 years so I am going to trade and buy my way to contender status.Well here`s a news flash for you Mr.Burke you still stink you trade away 3 draft picks for a guy who is better suited for the Battle of the Blades the the NHL,Kessel grow a pair you puss! Over paying a bunch of mediocre free agents and trading for a few more average Joes is not going to make the Leafs a contender,the same applies for all the other middle of the pack teams."
514966,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-26 16:01:00,0,Versteeg demoted to second line.  http://www.torontosun.com/sports/columnists/mike_zeisberger/2010/10/25/15825411.html
514970,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-26 16:41:00,0,"They were saying it may be all the pressure being put on Versteeg, that is to blame, so lets take some of that pressure off. Maybe he will pick up his game. I think we have two solid lines now."
514973,tb4me,2010-10-26 16:55:00,3295,"its about time! He is at best a 2nd liner. But Johnny comeon , the pressure? Really? I mean he is in Toronto, cant take the heat , dont play in Toronto..Burke was on billy waters show yesterday. He says they have 4.7 mill in cap space plus a trade so were now in the market for a 6mill player! He has had 2 solid hits in the bast 24 hrs.""Not nibbles , nibles are different from Hits"", says burke(must be a fisherman). There are a large amount of teams out there that are in cap trouble! Id like to see richards come to TO!!!"
514982,capt bruce,2010-10-26 17:20:00,820,"Hes a good player but he is trying way  to hard got to relax out there , he knows our offence is slim ,  he has to go back to what was working in preseason , just has to relax , lossen up the grip on his stick and make those passes he is so able to , hard place to play but if you do good lots of upside . Hes still young has tons of talent Im sure he will come around . Now who is Burke after , cant wait to see , team is headed in right direction , give Burke some time , even the Philly game was better than any last year , fun team to watch ."
515017,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-26 19:33:00,0," He went from third line to first, and given alot more ice time. Not to mention, the Toronto Media has really been shinning the light on him.I'd like to see Richards come to T.O also. Man, Phaneuf has to improve his defense(play the body more) or I think we should start benching him.......Komisarek, great defensively but man does he needs some work offensively. And I'd rather have Lebda then Gunnarsson.   What was working is short passes and the team coming out of their end as a team. Versteeg will pick up his scoring. Its only a mater of time. Maybe it will be better for him to loosen up on the second line."
515024,lookinforwalleye,2010-10-26 19:58:00,4399,  That happens when you take a third line guy and announce to the world that he is the new first line guy.  Last week you said you had two great lines now it`s two good lines IMHO right now you have one okay line.  BTW did you see who is in first in the conference!!!Just saying  I hope the Leafs win to-nite or it may start to get ugly!!!
515025,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-26 20:03:00,0," We did have two great lines. Kessel scoring on one line and Macarthur on the other. But now I think we will have two REALLY solid lines.  I also said we had a great checking line, but Orr and Brown are missing in action....  Yes, Montreal won in overtime. FOR REAL!!!We should beat Florida and regain the lead. If we don't, time to throw out Wilson!"
515032,capt bruce,2010-10-26 20:25:00,820,"""Time to throw out Wilson"" that time was last year WHY does Burke hang on to this guy , Cant and Wont coach youg guys , get free of him Burke , we need a coach that can bring out the best in our young guys !!!!!"
515064,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-26 23:05:00,0,All set for the game! They are going with Guigere but truth be told? The Monster has played better. He stole a game for us. Guigere has yet to shine. Hopefully tonight is his night!
515112,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-27 01:41:00,0,"Well...we did it but it was a hollow victory....Florida outplayed us but we got lucky, on a goal that should have been called goalie interference....When Florida came out of their end, their players are getting in the clear and their passes are on the tape. When the leafs come, they are all covered. That's why they cant get anything going...  They need to hit more. That's when the crowd wakes up. Tim Brent played with the most heart today. And I told my brother, its not over till Kessel scores and I wasn't left disappointed.  Bring on the Bruins!!!"
515170,jbailey,2010-10-27 12:00:00,866,that was such a boring game to watch wow i will def. be skipping any other games vs florida lol
515180,tb4me,2010-10-27 13:47:00,3295,"Good game, real basic. Orr's goal was questionable but well take it! so were now 5-3 and 1 on the season! Thats awesome. 11 points in 9 games. who would have thuk it..lol"
515424,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-28 01:59:00,0," And that was after a long shift! Kessel was a great deal! We'll see how those draft picks work out for Boston!  Remember what I said about Kessel before the season started. 40 goal scorer with potential to be 50, if he had the right line mate(s). I hope I didn't jinx him!!"
515442,lookinforwalleye,2010-10-28 02:28:00,4399,  If my Aunt ____ she`d be my uncle!!!
515537,jbailey,2010-10-28 13:18:00,866,"armstrong is out for 4-6weeks for surgery on his hand versteeg is out day to day with a sore back, with caputi being called up  hopefully it will still be a good game!"
515773,uglyfish,2010-10-29 01:11:00,981,"missing versteeg and armstrong in the lineup is very noticeable. caputi is playing well though. still stings to see how bad u can outplay a team and still be on the wrong side of the scoreboard. and the first goal, there was some karma from the non call on colton orr last game, that was a horrible interference call.  on a side note, i cant wait to see kaberle and grabavski GONE! kaberle has not played well at all this year. his defensive zone play has been horrendous. grabovski... well, he just flat out sucks and has since the leafs picked him up.  lebda again continues to disappoint."
515794,jediangler,2010-10-29 02:22:00,1923,"Great game tonight eh? Boston wins, Timmy gets the shutout, Bergeron gets the winner (his 100th), Seguin scores, Ke$$el doesn't and Boston's leading scorer throws Toronto's tough guy captain to the ice like a ragdoll. As good a game as I've seen this year."
515853,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-29 13:38:00,0," We did out play Boston. They just got the lucky breaks. The leafs looked good last night after 3 lackluster performances. They came out swinging right from the gate.Caputi was our best player out there!  The only reason I would give away Kaberle is for a solid forward for Kessel to play with. Grabovski was the worst player on the ice for 2 periods but picked it up in the 3rd. Our defense played great but am still not feeling Phaneuf...Looks like they were working on the power play, so I expect it to get better from here on. We need one timer's just like the Boston goal.The Monster played well.  Gotta love that new Molson Canadian commercial!!    Boston was getting manhandled by the leafs.Although Timmy made some great saves? His defense helped him out the most. What is it with these defensemen blocking leaf shots? Kessel wasn't himself and I think the booos were getting to him. Plus he did get robbed coming in and the ref blew the play dead because he lost sight of the puck."
515892,muskymatt,2010-10-29 16:01:00,2608,"  Of course they did....that's why the laffs won..........oh wait.....they didn't....they lost. What's that ,4 losses of the last 5 games????  Oh poor little Kessel got his feelings hurt eh? boo hoo  He better invest in some ear plugs then cause he's going to need them.....  I love the fact Seguin scores.....you couldn't have written it better....  Thank you Kessel,Thank you Kessel,Thank you Kessel     http://[media]<object width=""640"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV-8CKo0mTo?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV-8CKo0mTo?fs=1&hl=en_US"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""640"" height=""385""></embed></object>[/media]"
515898,muskymatt,2010-10-29 16:21:00,2608,  Yup.....which just goes to show that laff fans can't recognize real talent no matter where they are.  
515899,Mike Pike,2010-10-29 16:28:00,1332," Kessel's got 7 goals already this young season so I'd say; ""Thank you Boston!"""
516272,jediangler,2010-10-31 02:25:00,1923,"How many did Ke$$el get tonight? Seguin scored against the Sens and Timmy posted another shutout, his 3rd of the season. He's 6 - 0 with a .50 GA average. Bruins 4 Sens 0."
516273,jediangler,2010-10-31 02:27:00,1923,Did the Leafs outplay the Rangers tonight too?
516286,ontariofisherman,2010-10-31 03:03:00,52,there's always next year for the leafs. lol
516390,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-31 17:30:00,0, For sure! Did you see the shot count? The Rangers couldn't even muster much offense. They got one fluke goal on the boyle(of all people that hasn't scored a goal in 4years) shot. Thanks to our defense men pinching and Boyle coming out of the box. And the second goal was a penalty shot.  35 shots on the goalie. 35 shots blocked by the defense men and 19 shots that missed the net.  We had the better scoring chances and we hit a post. We didn't get the lucky breaks. I think the leafs have picked up their game in the last two outings.
