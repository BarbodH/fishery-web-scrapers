519617,Beans,2010-11-13 12:14:00,3339,Clever...I used a piece of swimming noodle...cut a slit half way through lengthwise...inserted transducer cord...then wound duck tape around the noodle...  I told you Cliff...I'm more than a pretty face...
519623,SlowPoke,2010-11-13 13:36:00,2984,"Nice idea, thanks for posting. I splurged for the ice-ducer to rid myself of the extra 18' of cable but that would have been handy last winter."
519634,BFSC Kevin,2010-11-13 15:30:00,1351,very nifty
519666,skeeter,2010-11-13 19:05:00,1907,"Thanks for posting this.  as soon as i watched the video i went out and made one. i used a 300ml orange juice bottle and it works great. i tried it out in the bath tub, just had to adjust where i put the electrical tie to make it stand straight up. it just elimated the wood T i made and now the whole thing fits back into the case that the finder came in. less bulky now and lighter.  great idea!!!!!!!!!!!

519672,kickingfrog,2010-11-13 19:46:00,8333,"Genius often seems so simple in the end.  Many of the bottled water bottles now have a reduced plastic cap that might be too small, but there are other plastic bottle options as well."
519674,GoneFishin,2010-11-13 19:57:00,349,Are there any restrictions using your every day fish finder in the cold? I'm planning on bringing out my hds5 but don't want to ruin it obviously..
519679,Handlebarz,2010-11-13 20:37:00,3790,that is a good idea I wonder would you need to seal the holes made in the cap? silicone over the holes might be a idea I think I will be using it this year.
519680,misfish,2010-11-13 20:47:00,29133, Sealing the holes would be a good idea.Not sure how long it would take for the water to seep in.   Yep   Everyone has ideas to make it simple. Anybody listening.   Thanks for the vid.
519681,misfish,2010-11-13 20:52:00,29133,"Another question,why are the transducers so bloody big?"
519682,Tybo,2010-11-13 20:54:00,1373,"Ah Brian, How does the air get out."
519684,misfish,2010-11-13 21:05:00,29133,  
519685,Woodsman,2010-11-13 21:05:00,1286,I use a similar set-up to Beans.  
519687,ld17,2010-11-13 21:07:00,319,there is a bit of a flaw with this jimmy rig.  A normal ice ducer will sink past the hole which is where you want it to be to get a proper reading.  With the set up as it is will float at the top of the hole which is not ideal.  I suggest putting in some sand or gravel in the bottle to get it to sink and then use the pool noodle idea and a bobber stop to get it to stop at the bottom of the hole.  That's my 2 cents + HST but it you pay cash you can avoid the taxes all together.
519713,Woodsman,2010-11-13 22:39:00,1286,Although I agree having the transducer below the ice is best it will still work closer to the top just not as good. By adding sand to the plastic bottle(rigged as in the video) it would sink & flip the transducer so it would point toward the surface. Not good. If your going to use the pool noodle anyway why even bother with the bottle & sand?
519731,glen,2010-11-13 23:42:00,2641,If the angle of the dangle is not perfect you are missing part of the bottom readings.
519732,walleyejack,2010-11-13 23:42:00,358,"I use the same idea as Woodsman,piece of pipe insulation,tie it onto the cabel and throught it in the hole,I have the bell shaped ducer so it pretty much points straight down as the cable come straight out the top. Happy fishing"
519752,adempsey,2010-11-14 00:56:00,1498,"A little bit of water in the bottle might be good to make it go a bit deeper, but still float.  Would have to test it though."
519842,Rich,2010-11-14 13:40:00,3927,I had mine screwed in to a piece of scrap wood. I jammed it into the slush so it pointed straight down. Always worked for me!
519845,canadadude,2010-11-14 13:56:00,769,"my only problem is water bottles get easily crunched, there not the most durable plastic and when I'm out on the ice I need some durability in my gear.I like the swimming noodles or pipe insulator methods best, there pretty much crunch proof.The plastic water bottle idea looks great in the house but I can see it coming out of my sleigh flat with holes in it, plus it would take up alot of room in an 8"" or 6"" hole."
520169,johnnyb,2010-11-15 16:42:00,3413,Hmmmm.....I DO like the bottle idea....but DON'T like the idea of not having the ducer below the ice...so far my chunk of foam is working well for me
520185,wallyboss,2010-11-15 17:18:00,1095,"The ducer has to be under the ice or you will miss the fish that are coming in from the sides. I usually drill a second hole to put my ducer in when fishing out of a my hut.  I like the foam method , that bottle will last a few times and then will break when you most need it."
520196,Terry,2010-11-15 17:39:00,14456,"the ducer does not have to be all the way under the ice to have full coverage  a 20deg transducer with 2 ft of ice in a 10 hole, the signal only covers 8"" of the hole where the ice ends  so in most cases I have the ducer about 16"" below the foam..... and it does the trick just fine"
