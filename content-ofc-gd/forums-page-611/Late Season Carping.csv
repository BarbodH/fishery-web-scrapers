520635,dsn,2010-11-16 22:03:00,1018,It's late in the season for carp fishing in some areas. But found some snuggled together trying to stay warm through out the night into the morning. Got some pics not alot.  Not even as much as I wanted. Still  trying to get used the the SX130. I used to have 700A. Which had a beter camera grip.  And now I have the SX130 below.  I have to slowly grab this camera and make sure I have solid grip on it. Unlike the one above. Sure hate to lose another camera.  Here are the pics from this morning.       If the weather stays sunny Thursday and Friday...this week. I might go back for more. I want the 3 footer I landed but didn't take a pic of it because I couldn't figure out where the self-timer was on this new Digi. Also still playing around with the settings. Some shots were completely a blurr.  Practice makes perfect.   DSN
