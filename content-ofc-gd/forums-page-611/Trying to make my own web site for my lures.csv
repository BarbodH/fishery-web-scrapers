519913,adempsey,2010-11-14 18:42:00,1498,"Ya, that link doesn't go anywhere on the web.  It's local to your computer."
519917,fishinguypat,2010-11-14 19:21:00,547,doesn't work
519923,Terry,2010-11-14 19:42:00,14456,some how I think at this point he will know that it doesn't work and it's a dead link to his own computer but that just a guess  LOL

520293,Handlebarz,2010-11-15 23:17:00,3790,Thanks Terry and guys I posted this yesterday after working on it for a very long time I thought I had it done right but did not realize that it was just back to the Mac. I was going to try and use mobil me from Mac but it sais that I only get 20 MB for the site is that enough? Or can I put it on one of the free web sites? Like web.com? Just wondering as I really like what I had done so far. Is there some way to email the files to a person who hosts sites like Tj?  I guess I should stick to making lures and driving truck two things I can do or think I can
520296,Terry,2010-11-15 23:26:00,14456,20 MB should be enough to get you started
