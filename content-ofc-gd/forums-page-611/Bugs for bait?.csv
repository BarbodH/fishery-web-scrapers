520521,Perch Thug,2010-11-16 18:01:00,2,"Last winter I fished on Houghton lake MI, we used beaded spoons tipped with wax worms, spikes (which is like a maggot) or a moussee grub. I have never caught more big perch than using this set up. The problem is that I cannot find anyplace to buy the ""Kens"" Spoons, or the bugs here around Simcoe. I found one online retailer for bugs, and just got 1000 spikes and put them in the fridge. The lady told me they should last for a couple months. I tried to buy less but they only sell in bulk. Is there some place I can get this stuff in smaller portions?  here is the link for big portions.  www.baitbugs.ca  "
