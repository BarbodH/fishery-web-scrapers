It almost felt like a summer day with the sun shining and very little wind. A rare occurence for Lake Erie at this time of year. I started to search for bigger fish hoping to find a small school of tanks, but it was difficult to cover water without wind. After only getting a few bites jigging Mr.Champs, we began to employ three-way rigs with jointed Shad Raps and covered water like last week.  It was slow but steady picking up a fish here and there, and we even managed a couple of double headers. Still, the tanks eluded us for the most part. Greg's first fish of the day was a personal best for him. It was only a 'good' fish by Lake Erie standards, but he was thrilled with the mid to high 5 pound smallie. He didn't care if he caught another fish all day, that made his trip  But... he was on fire getting fish after fish in the morning. A great introduction to a new lake for Greg!  A very happy Greg with his PB smallie     While Greg was on cloud nine, Mitch and I were wondering where the big fish were, as neither one of us cracked 5 pounds all day. We still had a great day and got about 35 hard-fighting smallies and a walter. We got most fish on jointed Shad Raps, but we also got a bunch jigging Mr. Champs and one on a Trigger X tube.  I saw a buddy Dean out there, and he wasn't washing lures lol. He had a great day with the three-way Shad Rap technique, and he also got a PB. He got about a 5 pound smallie beside us jigging a blue and silver Champ in the afternoon.  I zoomed in and took a few shots, and they turned out well from about 150-feet away   It doesn`t look like a big smallie cause Dean is a giant dude!        The water was clear and approx 53 F., with only a small ripple on the water. it's still a little warm, and the bigger fish should come out to play when the temps dip a little more. We covered a lot of spots in the Eastern Basin with similar results. I can't wait until the action really heats up, and the tanks start to bite more consistently!  Good to have you guys out, and thanks for the deadly veal on a bun Greg! Congrats on your PB`s boys!  Good fishing!  Aaron"
