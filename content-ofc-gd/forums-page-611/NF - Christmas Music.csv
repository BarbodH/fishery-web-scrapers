520102,The Urban Fisherman,2010-11-15 13:46:00,2050,Good Mornin' OFC.  This weekend we were out and about and I couldn't believe how many stores are all geared up for Christmas! They're still clearing out their Halloween stuff! lol It got me thinkin' though..... My Christmas music libraby sucks!  What are your favourite songs and by who?  I'd like to start buying some decent tunes for the kids to enjoy next month!  Have a great week!  Ryan
520104,Pigeontroller,2010-11-15 13:50:00,2793,Can't go wrong with Burl Ives!
520107,ketchenany,2010-11-15 13:53:00,3229," I don't usually frequent malls much, but Saturday morning I was at BPS and sure enough there it was Christmas music!  One woman actually made it known that it was too early for it."
520110,The Urban Fisherman,2010-11-15 13:56:00,2050," Good Call Pigeon!  Thanks.   lol we don't really have much in the way of ""malls"" around here! We hit up the grocery store and the pharmacy - I can only imagine what the malls are like... I love Christmas but I think it takes away from it a little if you're surrounded by it for a month and half... I'm ok with any time in December though..."

Almost made me run for the doors, Ryan!!  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the Christmas holidays, but, man, wait until late November at least. As for songs, most of the classics are always good...I'm not a religious person but I do love O Holy Night.  My all time favorite, David Bowie and Bing Crosby's Little Drummer Boy."
520180,Terry,2010-11-15 17:06:00,14456,Pink Floyd  Doors  Led Zeppelin   always puts me in the Xmas mood  a little Ozzie Osbourne while decking the halls works for me
520183,mercman,2010-11-15 17:16:00,7054,  Always makes me warm and fuzzy.

520203,crappieperchhunter,2010-11-15 17:58:00,2582,"Don't mind it so much in the malls...but it drives me crazy when my fav radio station starts playing the Christmas tunes so early. A month of Christmas tunes in the car all the time is just too much for me.  Wish I could help you with some suggestions for albums Ryan...but I really don't have any Christmas ""Favourites"""
520386,Nipfisher,2010-11-16 03:56:00,2449,"Ever hear that song ""I want a hippopotomous for Christmas""? Our radio station plays it hear about 3-5 times per day during the festive season.  Hear it is....  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjwiwcUKK1c  Speaking of which my wife and 7 year old put up the tree on Sunday."
520402,Handlebarz,2010-11-16 10:02:00,3790,Bobnoxious was cranking through my house last weekend gotta love having kids around. These are just the three I could find on you tobe but they have a whole Christmas album called HOHOHO and its all great 1 or 2 songs that have a little swearing  These are great rocking Christmas toons HOHOHO   Police Nabbed my dad   Silent night 
520403,Alumacraft,2010-11-16 11:05:00,139,"Every Christmas day I have too hear Emerson,Lake,and Palmer's I Believe In Father Christmas."
520450,crappieperchhunter,2010-11-16 14:02:00,2582,"Again Ryan sorry I have no album to recommend. But the following is my all time favourite Christmas song and video. Great song, the video is well done and I just flat out admire this individual and his family for the road taken to help him to pursue his dream of being a musician. Hope you all enjoy it.         "
520481,Beans,2010-11-16 15:50:00,3339,"Sorry to admit, but I am not much of a Christmas person (long story) but I do like Johhny Mathias' version of ""Oh Holy Night"""
520497,Grimace,2010-11-16 16:35:00,2020,Bing Crosby doing Mele Kaliki maka always makes me chuckle and think of Clark W Griswold daydreaming about his pool that the Christmas bonus is suppose to buy.
520558,Gerritt,2010-11-16 19:23:00,6129,"Bing Crosby, Rita McNeil, Perry Como, Anne Murray etc"
