520005,ChrisK,2010-11-15 00:53:00,2772,Another weekend has come and gone. Two days on the river in low crystal clear waters. Looking out at the pools you would figure there wasn't a fish to be had but they were there appearing out of nowhere to crush an offering. I was lucky enough to witness a larger fish come up chasing something and then snatching it up going into a roll as it broke the surface...very impressive....   
520008,skeeter,2010-11-15 00:59:00,1907,nice looking fish chris. keep up the good reports.
520009,Dozer,2010-11-15 01:01:00,896,"Atta boy Chris!  I love watching steel snatching food items, especially when its my offering! By the way, nice flies"
520010,Joey,2010-11-15 01:03:00,9122,"That's awesome Chris, you've got them dialed in now  Joey"
520014,Leecher,2010-11-15 01:07:00,7832,Doesn't get any better than that Great job ChrisK    Nice chrome Thanks for sharing Leechman
520023,ChrisK,2010-11-15 01:19:00,2772,"I just can't believe they are so willing to take these flies. You would figure in such clear low water they would be spooky and be after something a little more detailed like a prince nymphs or hairs ear's but no they want woolley buggers,fine by me :)Trick is to scale way down and get rid of all the lead on your rig. Run floro carbon right up to your 2 gram float and stack 4 bb's splitshot directly under it) letting the weight of the fly/bead take it to depth which isn't very deep in the pools I'm running,like three or four feet...I'm sure I could fish alot deeper with this set up if I had to pending on current....So far I've fished this particular run in high dirty water,medium stained and low and clear and the fly that did it for me in all conditions was the woolley bugger in black and sometimes in purple pending..."
520031,Leecher,2010-11-15 01:37:00,7832, Thanks Chris for giving us a detail description of your setup to hook into those beauties Sounds like you had a riot going on Tight lines Leechman
520050,ctranter,2010-11-15 02:20:00,543,"Those small black wooly buggers always produce for me too.  I find purple is effective in clear water as well.  Most days, a single egg fly is just as good."
520054,splashhopper,2010-11-15 02:23:00,2931,and here I went a caught perch when I could have just driven down to your place and knocked on the door and begged to be taken for some real fishing
520099,solopaddler,2010-11-15 13:31:00,8605,Great stuff as usual Chris.  Next time instead of stacking shot up under your float try utilizing a self c0cking float.  If you don't have any you can make them easily by wrapping leadcore on the bottom stem and epoxying it.
520142,torco,2010-11-15 15:48:00,656,Great report and some good tips in here.
520260,ChrisK,2010-11-15 21:38:00,2772,I never thought of that Solo....But wouldn't the profile of a wrapped float stem be greater than the profile of the 4 bb's under the float ? These are 2 gram floats I'm using and have the diameter of a pencil. The stems are quite fine though. I'll give it a try and get back to you on that one.
520291,aplumma,2010-11-15 23:07:00,6896,Very nice fish Chris but were is my favorite hold?   Art
520292,MJL,2010-11-15 23:17:00,2427,"Very nice Chris  Flies work awesome when the fishing is tough.  Ironically, some of my hottest fly patterns for super clear, super pressured conditions happen to be BIG (tied on size 4-1/0 hooks...Sometimes articulated)."
520317,buckster,2010-11-16 00:58:00,530,Nice fish!  Wish i had the patience to tie up bugs!  Time to raid someones fly box!
520502,Aaron Shirley,2010-11-16 16:52:00,655,Nice chrome
520619,ChrisK,2010-11-16 21:39:00,2772,"Art, Next fish I get pending if theres an audience"
520623,ChrisK,2010-11-16 21:48:00,2772,The pattern that I use(skinny bead head bugger) is one of the easiest ones to tie. Takes under five minutes to do one up but thats only cause I take my time. If I can tie these up anybody could....Matter of fact I highly recommend any one who is thinking about getting into tieing there own flies to just go out and get a cheap vise and all the rest of the information you need is online and or right here. I'd be more than happy to help out anyone who wants to learn.
