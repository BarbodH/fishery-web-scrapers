519081,spinnerbaitking,2010-11-11 03:51:00,1622,Great report Joey & congrats on the Ski Richard
519121,lew,2010-11-11 12:09:00,12766," I think that's it for LSC this year Joey, but we'll set it up for next year again and try to pick a date when all the regulars can get together. Pete had to miss it this year too."
519171,Leecher,2010-11-11 15:38:00,7832,"Great report and pics Joey Got to love fishing with great company, hook into fish (....and a great looking ski btw!!!) and retire to some great hospitality Just doesn't get any better then that Thanks for sharing your weekend with us!!! Leechman"
519342,Bly,2010-11-12 03:00:00,1556,"Awesome as always Joey and gorgeous ski, congrats!  My condolences also to J."
520407,Marc Thorpe,2010-11-16 11:43:00,621,"Once again Roy and Joey,Paul and the Big Man ......Adam, for providing memories in my life"
520414,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-11-16 12:10:00,1362,Super report Joey!....the smiles on everyone's face says it all!!
518398,Joey,2010-11-08 16:05:00,9122,"We had planned for months to go to Roy's last weekend and as the saying goes, best laid plans........  We were to go from Friday to Sunday and on Saturday night Marc Thorpe, who had Adam over for a weekend of fishing, were going to join us for a gourmet supper.  Then on Thursday we came to the sad conclusion it was not going to happen as J had a family member pass on and they would be attending the funeral on Saturday.  We were sad for J's loss and understood.  Roy had other plans tho and talked to Marc who generously agreed for us to fish with him and Adam for Saturday.  We were thrilled to say the least and did a quick pack after work on Friday and were on the road by 6 p.m. headed for Quebec  We arrived around midnight (after a wrong turn at albequerque) and had the usual bull session and catching up with Roy, staying up entirely too late  Thank God Marc did not arrive to pick us up until 9:00 a.m.  As Roy said, ""Marc doesn't take people out for early morning boat rides, he takes them out to catch fish when they're biting.""   Hahahahaha!  So off we went to Canadian Tire for a Quebec fishing licence and then on to the water.  It was a balmy 5C and winds weren't too bad at all.  Sunny for the early morning, cloudy most of the afternoon.  We've never had the opportunity to fish with Marc and it was a great experience.  He really knows what he's doing and it was fantastic to watch.  Here he is at the helm.     A picture of Adam enjoying the fresh morning air.    Paul looking happy, even tho I'm pretty sure he didn't feel so well after our late evening    Some laughs and getting the camera ready.     Adam advised me that I was up first and I'm ever so greatful for that.  We finally had a rip sometime in the afternoon and this was the result.         She was a gorgeous 40 incher, pretty hefty, with some nice markings  We had no other takers for the day, but the company was great so it was all good!!   I took a few random shots:             Check out the downriggers on this one!!!      So off to Roy's for supper later in the evening, and even Helene joined us for the night     The always lovely J.     H trying not to get her pic taken.      Something is amusing Marc      Adam relaxing.     Smile for the camera!!!!!       Roy, looking fantastic!!!     Flambe Quail, yum yum!!    I have to say, supper was absolutely fantastic and I wish I had taken a picture of the finished product because it was spectacular, from the smoked salmon salad, to the main course of quail and rice and then on to dessert with homemade pavlova and hazelnut cake and brie with pear.  Every mouthful was a delight.  Thank you, thank you Roy and J, you put on a spread nobody could top  Marc and Adam left shortly after in preparation for their next day on the water and even tho Marc invited us again to join them, we graciously declined as we wanted to spend some quality time with Roy on Sunday.  Thanks again Marc and Adam, we really appreciated you letting us tag along, oh and the musky was the cherry on the cake!!  So about 1:30 rolls around and we got packed back up and ready to leave and Paul goes out to load the truck and comes back in - flat tire  Paul and Roy spent the next 2 hours trying to get the the darned spare to unlock from under the truck.  The locking mechanism was stuck (salt and rust).  It was a fiasco but they finally got it done.  Mike the Pike stopped by to say hello in the middle.  Nice to see you again Mike.  The drive home was uneventful and the time change gave us an extra hour so that was a nice bonus.  So thank you again Roy and J for having us and thanks again to Marc and Adam for taking us out for the day.  Cheers,  Joey"
518399,mercman,2010-11-08 16:16:00,7054,"excellent report Joey. Looks like you had an excellent time !!! Roy and J are true gems. I'm a liitle shy when meeting new people, but when i met them we were talking like old buddys within 2 minutes. Barb and i live 20 minutes from Roy. Wish i could have met up with you guys. So how did ya like the drive through MTL, quite an experience i bet.  Paul    "
518400,Joey,2010-11-08 16:23:00,9122," We've done the drive several times now and yes, it can be ""interesting"" at times"
518402,asdve23rveavwa,2010-11-08 16:34:00,2690,"Sounds like a great time, and, I'm glad I'm eating lunch right now...that dinner sounds amazing!!  Congrats on the 40""er, really nice markings! I've never done the drive to Quebec, sounds interesting.  Is Montreal worse than TO?"

518412,Joey,2010-11-08 17:20:00,9122," Well its just a bit more confusing Frankie, and looking for the correct turnoff when there's a semi on either side of you and in front of you, all doing 120K, gets a a little tricky at times    I wouldn't say bad per se, there was just a steady flow, along with little sleep.  Can get the best of us"
