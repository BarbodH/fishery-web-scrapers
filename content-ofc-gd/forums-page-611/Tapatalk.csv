520329,Gerritt,2010-11-16 01:18:00,6129,"Evening guys! Tapatalk is a App that allows you to natively run forums on you're smart phone, Imagine being out fishing, nail a beauty fish talk a quick pic on your phone and upload it directly to OFC, reports on the Fly.... that would be awesome..  From their website..  Q: What's the point of this app if my members can access my site with mobile skin at no cost? A: We received a lot of feedback from users that they want a dedicated app on their smartphone. Most users are contented with the mobile skin or a standard web browser but some of them would appreciate a full-on native app on their phone. For example Tapatalk app allows user to upload photo directly from their phone to your forum as an image attachment. We are also rolling out Push Notification support so it helps your members to stay in touch with your forums while on-the-go.  Geek eh?.... perhaps a little bit... LOL  G"
