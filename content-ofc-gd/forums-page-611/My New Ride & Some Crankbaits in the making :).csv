520288,Rod Caster,2010-11-15 23:00:00,5784,"  The Cruize is smaller than the Altima and Camry...the Malibu is comparable to those. Cruize is similar to the corolla, focus, civic, sentra....definitly a good answer to those...I wonder if they'll make an S.S. model like they did with the Cobalt."
520295,MJL,2010-11-15 23:24:00,2427,"Super cool lures Jacques.  After making each one by hand, I'd hate to lose one to a brush pile on the first cast  It's marginally better to lose one to a pike though.LOL  Sweet ride too...I'm jealous...My 94 Accord has no cup holders"
520325,The Urban Fisherman,2010-11-16 01:12:00,2050,"Congrats on the new ride buddy! I'm going to be in the market for a new ride to Jaques... New to me anyways... About an 05 dodge Durango is what I'm looking at... I need the extra space for my future daughter! lol number tree!  Cheers, Ryan"
520373,Leecher,2010-11-16 03:13:00,7832," RC the higher end is an LTZ turbo which got a lot more options than the one I have..... Leather interior, sun roof, aluminum alloy wheels, GPS just to name a few   Thanks Mike!!!  I'd hate to loose one on the first cast too    Not expensive at all, just time consuming to make and paint.... and they come in 3's so that's a good thing   Thanks Ryan!!!  Good luck with the ride hunt!!! Again congrats to the both of you"
519982,Leecher,2010-11-14 23:46:00,7832,"Like the title says.... took some pics of my new ride today (Chevrolet Cruze LT Turbo 2011) and thought I share them with you..... GM really put the full package into this one and cannot be any happier with it  Fully loaded with it's 138 hp 1.4L ECOTEC Turbocharged I-4 , 6 speed automatic tranny with the option of manually changing gears while cruzing, AC, electric windows & mirrors, etc.... etc....  an amazing car to say the least  I'm sure you've seen the commercial on TV.... and the color they show is exactly what I purchased (Crystal red) real nice color  Here it is in multiple shots  Front view    Side view    From the back    The inside driver side    Passenger side    and the back    Simply put.... it's just a delight to drive  Now onto the cranks.... I've been putting together a few additional cranks for the tackle box that comes in a kit from Luremaking.com.... these are plastic body baits with rattles and the color of choice was white  Couple of pics      Not done yet but will post the final results when I'm done. Hope you enjoy!!! Tight lines Leechman"
519986,mercman,2010-11-14 23:55:00,7054,SWEEEETTTTT RIDE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Love the color Jacques. Love the Auto/Stick shifter.I have that on my Dodge Caliber R/T.Great on slippery roads.  has come along way since thier brush with finacial disaster.They make a solid car.Congrats my friend.   Paul  
519987,Rod Caster,2010-11-14 23:56:00,5784,"The cruize is definitly a step up from the cobalt. The interior looks great doesn't it? 138 hp is healthy power from a 1.4L Turbo...it would save weight on the front end too. Congrats on the new ride.  Good luck with the cranks, are the bodies exactly identical or do you find that some are better made than others?"
519989,corvette1,2010-11-15 00:15:00,1765,sweet ride leech congrats can't wait to see the cranks
519991,Leecher,2010-11-15 00:27:00,7832," Thanks Paul!!! Yeah the color is amazing and that auto shifter is simply awesome.... I'm loving it They sure did come a long way and made a solid car    Thanks Rod Caster!!!  I own a Cobalt before this one and there's no comparison.... like you said, a true step up from it   I truly enjoy it  As for the cranks, the bodies are identical.... bought a couple of kits from them and they are ready for the paint job Give them a try.... I'm sure you'll like them!!!   Thanks Corvy!!!"

520017,Leecher,2010-11-15 01:11:00,7832," Thanks Ian!!! Looks deceiving back there but lots of room in deed....  I'm 5'8"" and sat back there for a short time and can't complain about being cramped     Only draw back, you have to lean sideways to look up front and that's it"
520020,vinnimon,2010-11-15 01:15:00,2593,Nice ride leech!
520022,Guest Manitoubass,2010-11-15 01:16:00,0,"Nice car!  I also bought some pre made cranks for this winter, just to keep me busy, lol. I ordered 300, so I hope they turn out decent, haha"
520033,Leecher,2010-11-15 01:42:00,7832," Thanks Vince!!!   Thanks Manitoubass!!!  If you ordered from Lurmaking you won't be disappointed    They sure make quality products I just put in another order for making 10 spinnerbaits.... but this time I made the choice of the hardware and color I want for them Have fun creating, painting your lures!!!"
520034,Nipfisher,2010-11-15 01:47:00,2449,"Missing your front licence plate  Actually when we were teenagers and we would go to Quebec to party, we had to pull off our front plates and back our cars up against a wall or snow bank. lol.  The french boys didn't like us hitting on their pretty girls."
520036,GBW,2010-11-15 01:52:00,8460,"nice ride, to bad your in the land of the crazy drivers and well, it's gona get a ding or two...  Just Kidding! You going to make a custom Cruse Crystal Red Crankbait too?  In honor of the new ride..."
520038,Guest Manitoubass,2010-11-15 01:53:00,0," Yep, thats who I ordered from as per your suggestions. I can't wait to get to painting them customs. I hand carved one a few weeks back out of some cedar, and it was strangely relaxing. I worked on it for about 10 hours straight before I realized how long it had been, haha.  But yeah, ordering the prefab takes alot of the work out, thats for sure"
520044,Leecher,2010-11-15 02:02:00,7832," LOL Nip LOL  Good trick to fool them french boys   Thanks Geoff!!!  That's a possibility... If I do, will have to order some more stuff from Luremaking"

520283,Leecher,2010-11-15 22:40:00,7832," Thanks Pigeontroller!!!  They certainly put in a great package for this one   Thanks johnnyb!!!  Don't want to disappoint you, but this one is staying away from the hard surface for a while May be in a few years from now   Time to buy a pulling sled for the fishing gear   Thanks Simon!!!  They did a great job with the interior.... it's nice and comfy in the driver's seat or any other seat for that matter and every little adjustments or buttons is just a finger away"
