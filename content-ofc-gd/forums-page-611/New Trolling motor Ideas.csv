520205,bigcreekdad,2010-11-15 18:13:00,546,"I've had a Minn Kota Power Drive for 5 years now, and I've not liked it almost from the start. The effort it takes to get it out of the water is nonsense, and when you go to turn, it does so so quickly that I've darn near gone overboard a few times. It's newest gimmick is to run continously if you try to turn left. Also, it has actually turned on by itself twice....once at the dock of my favorite lodge when the motor was out of the water, and no one was in the boat ( two others witnessed this). In any case, I think it's time to move on from this poorly designed machine.  Any suggestions?"

520223,doubleheader,2010-11-15 18:48:00,497,"I could spend a week recounting my bow mount woes of the past but it would be too painful (for me). Anyhow, I have two now, just in case. That said, I've had two Terrovas that have been flawless. The deploy/stow mechanism is improved over the Powerdrive series and neither have had issues getting lost."
520240,ohhenrygsr,2010-11-15 19:42:00,947, Yes for sure.  Minn Kota has change quite a bit since the Power Drive.  If you have the room and fish a lot.  I just find a cable unit gives you more control without all the electronics you gotta deal with.
520241,Terry,2010-11-15 19:48:00,14456,me and trolling motors don't get along  they find a new way to screw up and bug me every season  but power drives are the nastiest of all....

520430,Uncle Buck,2010-11-16 13:31:00,1000,pedal/seat placement and seat height are very important if you go with a cable steer model...  haven't heard any negative reports on the electric steer terrovas though...
