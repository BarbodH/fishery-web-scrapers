520456,Nipfisher,2010-11-16 14:26:00,2449," Ryan, There is 6 full years between my 2 boys. I had already had my consultation and scheduled the surgery for in between fishing seasons (Oct-Nov) and during one of our practice sessions (June/July) it happened. The wife had no plans to get tied but after the delivery they did it for her.  Seems now our practices are less often with 2 kids."
520459,TDunn,2010-11-16 14:30:00,680,"Wow you have been busy since we went for that beer in London! Congrats Ryan! All the best,   TDunn"
520330,The Urban Fisherman,2010-11-16 01:18:00,2050,"Well Ginny and I had little Averie when we were still in university! Turns out they weren't lying about birth control only being 99% safe.  Then we had Luke on purpose!  Then you think we'd have learnt our lesson... Ginny went back on birth control but I guess we should have been more careful....  Averies future baby sister is due in march.... As if I wasn't  already busy enough! lol ah well, just another fishin buddy!  Thumbs up!   The punisher shot...   Had to show off my future daughter!  Cheers, Ryan"
520332,Gerritt,2010-11-16 01:20:00,6129,Congrats!  
520336,Handlebarz,2010-11-16 01:27:00,3790,Congrats for sure Ryan hope the winter is not to long for you or I guess I should say for her as I bet Dave will have some shows in some warm places for you to get away to.
520337,Pigeontroller,2010-11-16 01:29:00,2793,"Well, congrats Ryan, you are obviously a very dedicated parent...Sooooo, another one shouldn't be a problem!"
520338,Grimace,2010-11-16 01:30:00,2020,Do the ucbaby thing. It is awesome.  Congrats.

520349,mercman,2010-11-16 02:11:00,7054,Congrats !!!!
520353,irishfield,2010-11-16 02:16:00,26272,"I keep asking you, Ryan, if  you know what is causing these ""growths""! As I've told you before fella, congrats... from another man that knows BC doesn't work no matter the method. The last one was born with an IUD in her hand!"
520355,Musky or Specks,2010-11-16 02:28:00,2710,Your lucky your job is to be out on the water or you'd never see a fishing pole
520356,Terry,2010-11-16 02:28:00,14456,I think a Lowrance structure scan would make a clearer picture  but congrats
520363,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-11-16 02:51:00,1107,Congrats buddy
520366,Leecher,2010-11-16 02:55:00,7832,Congrats to you and Ginny Always a good thing to have more fishing buddies Thanks for sharing Ryan!!! Jacques
520367,BUSTER,2010-11-16 02:58:00,1336,  congrats guys!
520382,Nipfisher,2010-11-16 03:43:00,2449,
520422,Rich,2010-11-16 13:08:00,3927,Congrats dude!
520427,Joey,2010-11-16 13:17:00,9122,"That's just awesome, love the thumbs up  Congrats  Joey"
520433,The Urban Fisherman,2010-11-16 13:41:00,2050," Thanks Gerritt!   haha Thanks Mike! I think she'll make it through ok... first few months are usually the worst..   Thanks Pigeon - I'm always told they grow up so fast, so I figure I'll have plenty of time to fish without them when they're up and gone from the house.. or would rather hang out with their friends...   Thanks Grimace - we did it with Luke because they couldn't figure out if he was a boy or girl with the traditional ultrasound... I think we'll save the money this time around seeing as we know she's a girl and buy her something nice instead!    hahaha Mike - Ginny liked your 5 hole comment! that's funny stuff.  Thanks buddy!   Congrats Bri!  Thanks for taking the time to post a picture - march can't come soon enough for either of us I'm sure...   Thanks Mercman!"
520434,JohnF,2010-11-16 13:45:00,3494,Congratulations to all of you. Soon we'll have to take up a collection for junior sized fishing gear for your growing herd of mini-fisherpersons.  JF
520436,NAW,2010-11-16 13:48:00,4022,"Congrets Man,  Funny how things work eh..  There people out there who try and try for years and it never happens (me).  And there they’re people who can’t seem to avoid it no mater what protection is used.  That's life I guess."
520438,The Urban Fisherman,2010-11-16 13:48:00,2050," hahaha - Gotta love them to death regardless as to weather they were planned or not man.  Averie was my biggest so called ""mistake"" when I was still in university and she turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me! We beat the birth control odds TWICE - after the doc told me I was to young to get fixed.... they better dang well fix me now! lol   hah Yeah I see one all the time, except it's usually about 16 inches long, pink, and I'm always on the wrong side of the rod taking little fish off the hook! lol   I'd have to disagree and say that you'd likely get the clearest picture using a Humminbird Side imaging unit Terry! hahaha   Thanks man - have a good one!   Thanks dude!   Merci Mon Ami! Some day I'll get the whole family up your way for a visit! Looks like it's going to be a little while now that there's a little one on the way though!   Thanks Buster!"
520445,The Urban Fisherman,2010-11-16 13:59:00,2050, Thanks buddy - you thought it was hard to find a day for us to fish before...   Thanks Joey!  I'm just trying to increase the female population here on OFC of you girls! haha   haha Thanks John! I'm out bedrooms in the house now so we have no choice but to stop! Plus the boat is going to be jammed!   Thanks - I have a family member who had something like 16 miscariges before giving up... So that's why I would NEVER complain about having more kids even though they weren't planned.  There's people all over the world who want them and can't have them so we should consider ourselves VERY lucky! Best wishes to you my friend!
520446,The Urban Fisherman,2010-11-16 13:59:00,2050,"NIPFISHER - for some reason it won't let me quote you!  I tried to get ""fixed"" but that was when Luke was just a freshy and the doc's wouldn't do it because I was a young father with young kids yadda yadda... so Ginny went back on birth control, and we must have ""practiced"" a little to much!"
520452,Jay T,2010-11-16 14:17:00,282,"Congrats to you both, I am sure you won't have a problem getting ""fixed"" now. We have our third child coming this week or next! So far we have two boys, we couldn't find out what this one is, not that it really matters. I am done now, I got the snip in June.  Congrats again."
520454,Rod Caster,2010-11-16 14:23:00,5784,Congrats...lucky kids to have such a proud father!!
