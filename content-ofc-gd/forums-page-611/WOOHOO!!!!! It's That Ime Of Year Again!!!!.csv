Here is the glorious winner:   1. When his 38 caliber revolver failed  to fire at his intended victim during a  hold-up in Long Beach , California  would-be robber James Elliot did  something that can only inspire wonder.  He peered down the barrel and tried the  trigger again. This time it worked.   And now, the honorable mentions:   2. The chef at a hotel in Switzerland lost  a finger in a meat cutting machine and after  a little shopping around, submitted a claim to  his insurance company. The company  expecting negligence sent out one of its men  to have a look for himself. He tried the  machine and he also lost a finger..  The chef's claim was approved.   3. A man who shoveled snow for an hour  to clear a space for his car during a blizzard  in Chicago returned with his vehicle to find  a woman had taken the space.  Understandably, he shot her.   4. After stopping for drinks at an illegal bar,  a Zimbabwean bus driver found that the 20  mental patients he was supposed to be  transporting from Harare to Bulawayo had  escaped. Not wanting to admit his incompetence,  the driver went to a nearby bus stop and  offered everyone waiting there a free ride.  He then delivered the passengers to the  mental hospital, telling the staff that the  patients were very excitable and prone to  bizarre fantasies.. The deception wasn't  discovered for 3 days.   5. An American teenager was in the  hospital recovering from serious head  wounds received from an oncoming train.  When asked how he received the injuries,  the lad told police that he was simply  trying to see how close he could get his  head to a moving train before he was hit.  6. A man walked into a Louisiana Circle-K,  put a $20 bill on the counter, and asked for  change. When the clerk opened the cash  drawer, the man pulled a gun and asked for  all the cash in the register, which the clerk  promptly provided. The man took the cash  from the clerk and fled, leaving the $20 bill  on the counter. The total amount of cash he  got from the drawer... $15. [if someone points  a gun at you and gives you money,  is a crime committed?]   7. Seems an Arkansas guy wanted some  beer pretty badly.. He decided that he'd just  throw a cinder block through a liquor store  window, grab some booze, and run. So he  lifted the cinder block and heaved it over his  head at the window. The cinder block bounced  back and hit the would-be thief on the head,  knocking him unconscious. The liquor store  window was made of Plexiglas. The whole  event was caught on videotape...   8. As a female shopper exited a New York  convenience store, a man grabbed her purse  and ran. The clerk called 911 immediately,  and the woman was able to give them a  detailed description of the snatcher. Within  minutes, the police apprehended the snatcher.  They put him in the car and drove back to  the store. The thief was then taken out of  the car and told to stand there for a positive ID.  To which he replied, ""Yes, officer, that's her.  That's the lady I stole the purse from.""   9.. The Ann Arbor News crime column  reported that a man walked into a Burger King  in Ypsilanti , Michigan at 5 A.M., flashed a  gun, and demanded cash. The clerk turned  him down because he said he couldn't open  the cash register without a food order. When  the man ordered onion rings, the clerk said  they weren't available for breakfast...  The man, frustrated, walked away.  [*A 5-STAR STUPIDITY AWARD WINNER]   10. When a man attempted to siphon  gasoline from a motor home parked on  a Seattle street by sucking on a hose,  he got much more than he bargained for..  Police arrived at the scene to find a very sick  man curled up next to a motor home near  spilled sewage. A police spokesman said  that the man admitted to trying to steal gasoline,  but he plugged his siphon hose into the  motor home's sewage tank by mistake.  The owner of the vehicle declined to press  charges saying that it was the best laugh  he'd ever had."

Sure, maggots probably don't have eyes in real life, but what kind of kids show hand puppy looks that creepy?  But yeah, it's well known that most of these are bended truths or urban myths"
