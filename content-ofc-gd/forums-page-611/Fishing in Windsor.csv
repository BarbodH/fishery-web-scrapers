520561,Mack,2010-11-16 19:27:00,3,I am from Windsor and I am relatively new to fishing. I don't have a boat. Does anyone have any ideas on good places to fish in the area from the shore (that doesn't involve climbing fences or guard dogs)? Any tips would be appreciated. Thanks.
520568,I'mHooked,2010-11-16 19:39:00,525,On some of the fishing shows filmed on the Detroit river I'm sure I've seen people fishing from a wall/pier along the river side Looked to be a downtown type of area. I'd head down to the water front and see what's going on. Maybe strike a conversation with people fishing the wall and see what they're using and trying to catch. I think I recall Walleye being something to catch there.

Also  while down there for baseball eliminations for my son back in 2007. We camped at Holiday Beach Conservation Area and did quite well for silver and smallies wading along the beach
