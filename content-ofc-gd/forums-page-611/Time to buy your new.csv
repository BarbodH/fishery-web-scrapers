517273,Terry,2010-11-04 00:09:00,14456,licence here  the MNR website now has a link to buy next years fishing and hunting license
517275,irishfield,2010-11-04 00:12:00,26272,Gee.... I wonder if they've fixed their system to take an apostrophe yet...
517278,Terry,2010-11-04 00:17:00,14456,"I doubt it that is just too complicated for them, ' ."
517279,asdve23rveavwa,2010-11-04 00:17:00,2690,"Thanks, Terry!!  I'll be getting my three year renewal soon...got to have it for ice fishing!!"
517281,irishfield,2010-11-04 00:20:00,26272,"  Just checked.. I thought it was mine that was due, but I'm good 'till 2012. Leah's is done Dec 31st...."
517283,Whopper,2010-11-04 00:31:00,2174,"Better yet I wonder if non residents that hold a outdoor card can purchase a fishing license on line, it sure would make it easy on me A couple weeks back I had drive around for an hour to four different places to purchase one"
517288,skeeter,2010-11-04 00:47:00,1907,thanks for the reminder Terry..
517297,BUSTER,2010-11-04 01:26:00,1336,"Forgot to get my small game one day in oct, was saturday already, went on-line paid the 28 bucks printed out the licence and away I went, was really easy.."
517349,Bob,2010-11-04 12:05:00,370,"I've just recently attained the age where I no longer have to worry about a fishing license.  I will, however, keep my card current, just in case I want to walk the bush with a shootin' iron."
517385,tonyb,2010-11-04 14:01:00,1637,Thanks for the reminder! I'm due Dec 31st.  Plan to renew for the 3-year option again.  Less likelihood of forgetting to renew when it's only once every 3 years
517414,asdve23rveavwa,2010-11-04 16:17:00,2690,All set for another three years!!  Darn (and I don't mean darn) thing gets more expensive all the time!  Now lets see if I get it within 20 days...  
517477,jimmer,2010-11-04 20:17:00,2730,"Thanks for the reminder, just went and did it with no fuss. Hate the increase though."
517495,Terry,2010-11-04 21:28:00,14456,I hear you it cost me $159.96 
517497,cwpowell,2010-11-04 21:36:00,265,It wont let my buy a 3 year sport license?  The only options I receive are 1 year conservation for 2010 and 1 year sport for 2010  Nothing for 2011...
517499,Terry,2010-11-04 21:42:00,14456,that's weird
517517,misfish,2010-11-04 22:20:00,29133,Im in no rush.
517537,Fisherman,2010-11-04 23:06:00,7201,"Done, lets see about the 20 days.."
517561,newboykool,2010-11-05 00:15:00,81,gonna need 1 this year too turning 18 early 2011
517566,crappieperchhunter,2010-11-05 00:24:00,2582,Thx Terry I just took care of mine until the end of 2013
520566,Terry,2010-11-16 19:36:00,14456,got mine back in the mail already
520572,Fisherman,2010-11-16 19:48:00,7201,"Yep, looks like the early birds get the worm, got mine yesterday, 10 days."
520573,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-16 19:58:00,0,3 and 3 got mine yesterday as well....
520857,crappieperchhunter,2010-11-17 05:38:00,2582,Thx again Terry. Mine came Monday as well.
520858,bigfish1965,2010-11-17 05:56:00,3382,I am still waiting for mine..paid for it in the spring. Card center and i traded phone calls because I had changed my name on their file. It went from Richard to Rick............. Seriously. So a month ago they said i would get the card in 20 days.... Outsourcing...not always the answer.
520859,Bondar,2010-11-17 06:10:00,817,"  it likely wont let you do the 3 year because your card isnt expiring this year,  pretty sure you can only get the 3 year once your card is up to be renewed"
