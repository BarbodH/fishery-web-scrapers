520862,Carp,2010-11-17 06:47:00,1488,A hard fought come from behind victory. They were absolutely flying out there. The hustle and grind in the opposing teams end was a joy to watch.  I'll bet they're gonna sleep well after that game.
520867,Handlebarz,2010-11-17 10:08:00,3790,I think after the 1st period they all knew they were heading down to the minors so they had to pic it up. Other then a couple very STUPID things in the first it was a good game

Turned it off after the 2nd period, it was the worse hockey game I've seen in awhile a complete comedy, 7 penalties in a row....give me a break."
