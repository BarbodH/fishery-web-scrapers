519959,asdve23rveavwa,2010-11-14 22:27:00,2690,"In an eight team league, unfortunately....."
519961,uglyfish,2010-11-14 22:50:00,981,dont get too excited.... they're still the argos... cats just played a pathetic game from start to finish.
519963,misfish,2010-11-14 22:55:00,29133,"  Hey Frankie,back off eh,what else do we have,,,,,,,,,,   Wrong time to play a pathetic game.The cats had a good year. The blue boys, were hyped and on the ball the whole game.  Glad I had nascar on stream,so I could watch both."
520007,asdve23rveavwa,2010-11-15 00:59:00,2690,"  I hear you, man, I hear you!!!!!!!!!"
520098,tb4me,2010-11-15 13:27:00,3295,Ya that was an unreal game the cats played. I dont think I have ever heard such a quiet game in Hamilton..Sure picked a bad time to drop the ball...Pun intended
520137,Mike Pike,2010-11-15 15:24:00,1332,"Actually the crowd yesterday in the Hammer was pretty loud, expecially considering the Cats didn't give us much to cheer for in the stands.  Sloppy game for the Cats with dropped balls and turn-overs.  The Argos basically needed to show up and not turn the ball over to win this one."
520234,bigugli,2010-11-15 19:19:00,6138,"Did the poor wittle putty tats get dwownded?  For real excitement, the western semi. Gotta love the last quarter Hail Mary for OT"
520249,misfish,2010-11-15 20:21:00,29133,"  Yeah it seemed to the same loud crowd,as for the argos just had to show up,well,they sure penatrated that O line well all game. It was only a matter of time before Folley got to Glenn,and he did.  You can watch the hightlites here.   http://www.cfl.ca/video/index/id/15619?autostart=true   Listen to the hit at the 4 minute mark."
520252,Garry2Rs,2010-11-15 20:37:00,1425,"Big deal, they won second place in a four team race. We all know that, just like in hockey, Toronto can't get past Montreal."
520254,misfish,2010-11-15 21:04:00,29133, Argos have Montreals number this year.Will be an exciting game.   5 Jul 29 Toronto 10 at Montreal 41 7 Aug 14 Montreal 22 at Toronto 37 18 Oct 29 Montreal 37 at Toronto 30 19 Nov 7 Toronto 30 at Montreal 4
520309,Mike Pike,2010-11-16 00:28:00,1332,How is splitting their season series having Montreal's number???  Especially since Calvillo didn't even play in the last game.
520310,misfish,2010-11-16 00:38:00,29133,"  I just posted the results of the games. Nothing to do with ""they have thier number""They know what they have to do to shut them down. Just sik Folley on Calvillo .  Dunigan says they can do it as well. Play smart and they will win."
520322,spinnerbaitking,2010-11-16 01:05:00,1622,"I can't believe someone would say the words Toronto, play smart & win in any sport & not laugh before they got that out lol Richard"
520339,Mike Pike,2010-11-16 01:32:00,1332,"No, you posted the results of the games and said the Argos have the Als number.  Re-read your post."
520346,misfish,2010-11-16 01:56:00,29133,"  Lets see. I said  Argos have Montreals number this year. Good so far????????  Then I posted the season record.  5 Jul 29 Toronto 10 at Montreal 41 7 Aug 14 Montreal 22 at Toronto 37 18 Oct 29 Montreal 37 at Toronto 30 19 Nov 7 Toronto 30 at Montreal 4   Now If I had done it this way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  5 Jul 29 Toronto 10 at Montreal 41 7 Aug 14 Montreal 22 at Toronto 37 18 Oct 29 Montreal 37 at Toronto 30 19 Nov 7 Toronto 30 at Montreal 4    Then said,  Argos have Montreals number this year.  Then you would be correct.     But I didnt.  Enjoy the game."
520347,Mike Pike,2010-11-16 02:00:00,1332,Is it just me?
