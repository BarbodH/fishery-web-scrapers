520172,DRIFTER_016,2010-11-15 16:47:00,10439,You can use A size thread an any freshwater rod you want to build. The heaveier threads are best for heavier applications like saltwater trolling rods etc. Any heavier than A and all you are doing is adding unnecessary weight to your finished rod.

Any ideas on an amount of thread I should order for this type of project?  How about the epoxy?  Is it worth ordering in a larger amount for future projects?"
520247,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-11-15 20:17:00,0,"also, what kind of guide sizes do you guys like to use for your pin rods? how about your cork handle lengths ? i'm looking for any tips you guys have for a noob."
