520225,johnnyb,2010-11-15 18:54:00,3413,The presence of Roland and Jimmy doesn't improve the odds that I'll attend....but if Jeff (Gustaffson) and Gord (Pyzer) were there...THAT would get my attention.  But they'll probably be busy hauling in first ice 'eyes that weekend.

520487,Harrison,2010-11-16 16:05:00,2202," Would help with some material anyways!!!  Here is one for ya Brian:  The National Poetry Contest had come down to two semi-finalists:  A Yale graduate, and a Newfoundlander. They were given a single word, then allowed two minutes to come up with a poem that contained the word.   The word they were given was ' TIMBUKTU '. The Yale graduate steps to the microphone and said:   'SLOWLY ACROSS THE DESERT SAND TREKKED A LONELY CARAVAN. MEN ON CAMELS, TWO BY TWO DESTINATION - TIMBUKTU '.   The crowd went crazy! No way could the Newfie top that, they thought.  The Newfoundlander calmly made his way to the microphone and recited:  'ME AND TIM A HUNTIN' WENT, MET T'REE LADIES IN A POP-UP TENT. DEY WAS T'REE, AND WE WAS TWO, SO I BUCKED ONE, AND TIMBUKTU '!  The Newfie won hands down."
