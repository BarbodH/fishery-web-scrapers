Luckily i winterized the boat, just didn't get it in the garage before the snow came......ooooops!  Anyways...woke up yesterday morning to a snow covered landscape......my boy was too young to remember snow so he had a blast discovering snow for the first time so to speak.............                 After a morning of fun with Jack.....the lad wolfed down a HUGE lunch and was definitely the exausted side of tired by 1pm. Jack and Mum headed for a nap and i headed to catch supper.....i only had an hour but the lake i was at is only a few minutes up the road....and i usually stretch an hour  I think i wasted the first 20 minutes using my sinker and floating jig set up, because as soon as i changed to a oddball jig and large sucker minnow the bites were fast and furious. If i hadn't missed as many bites as i did i would have had 4 on the stringer no probs....but luckily the 2 i kept were 17"" and 20""......more than enough for our feed!  The small minnow ponds and lakes that are sheltered are already froze over.....i'll be firing up the auger for real by 1st week of December, possibly earlier.   <object width=""480"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9zuDj-bb4s?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9zuDj-bb4s?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9zuDj-bb4s?fs=1&hl=en_US"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""480"" height=""385""></embed></object>"

We still haven't seen any over here yet.... kind of surprising considering deer season being closed now.... usually it starts end of November  Ah well it'll come soon enough I guess Thanks for sharing Jacques"
