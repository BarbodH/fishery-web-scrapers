So checked out Snowmobile helmuts and I can get XS But they are fairly heavy,  SO I was thinking about a Bike Helmut or a Hockey Helmut.  What do you other Dad/Grandpas have the Kids wear???  Thanks Rick"
520825,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-17 03:20:00,4399,None of my business what you do but after seeing that TV program on ATV incidents I would not put any kid of mine on one!
520882,skeeter,2010-11-17 12:13:00,1907,"Rick, did you check out royal dist in barrie?  http://www.royaldistributing.com/main/  when you have an atv rolling over, what type of protection do you want him to have?"
520885,RickOnt,2010-11-17 12:27:00,669,Skeeter   Royal Distributing is where I was looking at the XS snowmibile helmut but the Sales Lad advised it might be too heavy and suggested a Hockey Helmut..  Rick
520887,Muskieman,2010-11-17 12:43:00,2472,"I've ran into this once before... I had a Hockey helmet on my son who was 4  at the time... we got stopped and almost charged by the OPP... the helmet must be DOT approved to be legal. He said I may as well have used a construction helmet.  I then purchased a XS ATV helmet for my son and found that it wasn't that heavy..  But if you still find that's it's too heavy and are worried of neck injuries due to weight you may use a "" Neck Guard"" like they wear in hockey for stability.  Randy "
520901,RickOnt,2010-11-17 13:50:00,669,"Randy  That's the kinda info I was looking for!!   I was wondering about the DOT thing and the suggestion about the ""Neck Guard"" very good idea.  Thanks Very Much Rick  PS  LFW  You likely think I should not be taking Him Icefishing too!!!  I was not looking for a lecture But Thanks anyways Rick"
