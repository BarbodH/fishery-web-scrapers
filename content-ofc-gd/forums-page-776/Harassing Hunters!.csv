392548,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-13 17:09:00,0,We've all read stories on here of over zealous land owners and such harassing fisherman and hunters... Seems some hunters fought back!  Way to go to whomever did!  http://www.sootoday.com/content/news/full_...oryNumber=42174
392549,Terry,2009-10-13 17:12:00,14456,good  maybe news of this will stop other stupid people from harassing us
392654,troutologist,2009-10-13 20:53:00,951,In the charges there is no mention impeding hunting/fishing or something to the effect of that verbage.   Is it not an offense to impede those lawfully carrying out hunting or fishing activities?
392676,bigfish1965,2009-10-13 21:47:00,3382," Yes, but the charges laid hold a lot more weight. Also sounds like they were not quite set up yet (being close enough to a road to be driven at would mean they are not quite hunting yet)."
392678,jediangler,2009-10-13 21:48:00,1923,How stupid do you have to be to mess with someone carrying a gun?
