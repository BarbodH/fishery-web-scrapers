I'm currently using a St. Croix Mojo Bass rod with the Curado but find the balance fairly off and the set-up to be tip heavy. So if anyone owns or had a chance to fish this combo please let me know what you think about it because I was planning to get match my Curado with it. Thanks!"
392418,JPD,2009-10-13 03:21:00,296,It will depend on which model and length you go for but there will be a substantial difference in overall weight and balance with the Cumara. They are very tip light compared to any other rod currently made by Shimano which says a lot and are under 5 ounces so you will be looking at less than 12 ounces for a total combo weight.  One thing you will also notice right away is how much power they have for a small and super light blank. The IM-10 graphite is very responsive and has a ton of backbone.  JP
