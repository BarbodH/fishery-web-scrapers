The coyote has yet to show his face, most of the pictures are blurry running shots. I have about 200 Raccoon pictures. I also shot some videos which were again mostly raccoons but I did also get some Turkeys and a domestic cat.  I was using an Acorn Rage block which is almost gone thanks to the coons. I put out some apples and corn today so I hope to get some deer pics by the weekend.      "
392664,Terry,2009-10-13 21:32:00,14456,they would make some nice hats  LOL
392682,misfish,2009-10-13 21:56:00,29133,Cool pics Doug. How far in is the cam? We should hook up soon and do some hunting.
392684,frozen-fire,2009-10-13 22:08:00,542,Do you have a link to the cougar stalking deer set?  That would definitely be something cool to see!
392709,Skud,2009-10-13 22:49:00,739,"Terry,  If I see a Coyote while sitting out there it will be a hat.  Brian,  The camera is set up about a two minute walk from my Dad's front door.  The area is more of a travel corridor during the rut and a winter hang                            out. Lots of thick cedars nearby but no great food source. The action gets better as the temps drop."
392714,richyb,2009-10-13 22:57:00,774,Is there a hardwood bush near by ? Untill theres lots of snow on the ground I havent seen many deer in pines. I bet in the cedars you would find some good trails and would have better luck getting pics.
