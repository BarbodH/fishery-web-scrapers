392751,richyb,2009-10-14 00:35:00,774,"Definitly the INTIMIDATOR ( dale sr.) , THE KING ( petty) ,  and tom cruise from days of thunder"
392761,shane,2009-10-14 01:02:00,652,"Lots of great drivers could likely make 'Hall of Fame', but my favorite driver for many years has always been Ken Schrader.  The happiest guy on the track.  Whether he was doing good or not so good, he always just seemed so happy to just be there."
392768,DRIFTER_016,2009-10-14 01:14:00,10439,Tons of guys deserve to be in the hall. Two I can think of right off the top are Cale Yarborough and The Silver Fox David Pearson
392795,Cudz,2009-10-14 02:01:00,2652,"Aside from the obvious like Petty and Earnhart, I would have to go with DW and Bill Elliot when he hangs them up.  Cale Yarborough is a great choice."
392802,Daplumma,2009-10-14 02:14:00,1961,Kenny is the man.He put out a book a few years ago.Good stuff and hes not a dumass.Dont know if he is a hall of famer but I'd love to share a boat with him one day.I predict Sr will be the first inducted.Not a bad choice. Joe

392829,MuskyBill,2009-10-14 04:43:00,311,"Earl Ross.  Won the 1974 Old Dominion 500 at Martinsville, by more than a lap I might add, using creative pit stratagy combined with an incoming storm. Race was over halfway & called, with Ross the winner. He was a teammate to Cale Yarborough at the time, driving for Junior Johnson in a car sponsored by Carling.  You might be asking ""why Earl Ross?""  He's from Alisa Craig, Ontario. Still the only Canadian to win in Nascar's top division."

393116,misfish,2009-10-15 01:28:00,29133,"I,ll be the first to say. If Dale SR had still been here and racing,he would not of made the top 5."
393133,Bernie,2009-10-15 01:58:00,3190,"I think a few of the voters were kissing butt. Both France's? Nope. Important guys, yes, but the racers are why the people go. David Pearson should have been there."
393155,oxcowboy,2009-10-15 02:29:00,544,"i know the list is out now, but dale sr. for sure.  lets face it he was nascar in its hay day.  i know i still will pull it up on youtube and shed a tear from time to time after a hard day of farm work and coors light.  cant help it!  i think jr johnson is also a good selection.  jason"
