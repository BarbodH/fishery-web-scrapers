391661,BillM,2009-10-09 23:19:00,17367,"They look like a good AS tire, although I'd pick up something a bit more offroad-ish (BFG AT, MT) etc.  The Toyo Open Country MT my oldman has on his truck are the loudest tire I've ever heard!  However, they look awesome.."
391672,Raf,2009-10-09 23:45:00,3495,the dueler a/t revos billy bob posted are probably the best a/t tire going right now.. they're also about twice the price of the tires posted in this thread.  road noise?  i thought that's what stereos are for.
391679,Fisherman,2009-10-10 00:00:00,7201,"Something better yet than the Bridgestone and good4a year, Michelin has a new series that has just come out, it replaces the LTX that they didn't make in 17"" LRE.  http://www.michelinman.com/action/tires/fi...on=4x4+Quad+Cab"
391694,Raf,2009-10-10 00:22:00,3495,"the LTXs, while a great tire for the highway - long lasting, quiet - were a terrible tire off-road.  you cant please everyone of course."
391703,pike slayer,2009-10-10 00:44:00,1177,"i was surprised how quiet my tires are on the pavement, they make a bit of a hummmm and they are a bit loud doing large slow turns like in a parking lot. you dont even notice if your not paying attention. the tire noise will not make or break a sale for me. youd be surprised how quiet they are."
391705,DRIFTER_016,2009-10-10 00:51:00,10439,I have had my eye on those Wrangler Silent Armor's for a while. Have heard nothing but good things about them.
391713,BillM,2009-10-10 01:30:00,17367," Dave, where's the report man?!?!??!?!?!"
391787,Jer,2009-10-10 12:56:00,1426,  Looking at both tires again (Territory vs SilentArmor)...they're not as similar looking as I thought .
391796,Tybo,2009-10-10 13:51:00,1373,"I  have been around light and heavy duty service trucks all my life. Trucks that get 60k to 120k put on yearly. One thing I can say. Is Goodyear couldn't build a truck tire to save your life. the wrangler series being the worse. My boss thought he was getting a great deal on tire for are fleet. Out of 7 trucks, not one set lasted 80k. I had a set on my z71. This truck had a very hard life. Blew out 2 side walls and lost a tread on the 401. this was there 6 ply tire. My GMC HD came with wrangler class e 10 ply. Didn.t get 2 years out of the set. I have used alot of brands in the 30 years i have driven pick ups. The  best brands I've come across. TOYO HANCOCK MICHELIN. I  will use BFG's if Thier priced right."
391797,Bernie,2009-10-10 13:56:00,3190,"Tread pattern is important but don't be fooled by it. The rubber makeup and internal structure are more what makes the tire. A good winter tire will make your vehicle incredibly agile and safer in winter conditions. Do your research before you buy. This will also apply to summer runners too. Big box stores will sell you tires but often the sales people really don't know much about how they work in driving conditions. They just like to make the sale. Go to a reputable tire shop and give them a chance first, it's what they do, so they should sell you a set of what you really need."
391814,tjsa,2009-10-10 15:39:00,1578," In my limited(or long, since 1990) experience with truck tires, I will have to agree with Tybo, I have run Toyo Open Country's for years. Tried the BFG all terrains after my Toyo's got worn out after 6 yrs., but they didn't last 2 years, so went back to the Toyo's, which are still on my tired old truck. Run Hancock on my car, impressed. Michelin, no idea, never used them. Sure they have tire howl, but I just turn up the stereo   :lol: The tire howl the Toyo's make didn't compare to the Gateway Monster Mudders I had on an earlier truck when I was in a 4x4 club though, or the 38"" Ground Hawg's a bud of mine ran. You could hear the howl of them 1/2 mile away   :D"
391837,smally21,2009-10-10 17:58:00,993,"there are 27 kinds of goodyear wranglers.  there are 56 kinds of bridgestone duelers.  all are rated drastically different on sites like the tire rack.  for me - the good year wrangler silent armour is the best tire in the universe, on or off the road.  huge increase in stability on dry pavement, awesome wet weather and snow performance with 0 increase in road noise.  30k and no visible wear whatsoever.  got wholesale prices from a guy on the job, PM if you are in the hamilton area and interested."
392165,getnjiggywithit,2009-10-12 14:03:00,18, I read that post and the guy wasn't complaning about the noise he wants to sell them because he thinks they are heavy!  E rated is a bit much for a little jeep!  Ive been looking at these tires for a little while now and although they don't make it in the size I want they look good!  I want something with an agressive tread yet not too loud on the hwy!  So far the best tire ive found thats aggresive and not too loud is a BF AT!  There are plenty of tires out there that are quiet but they suck offroad!  I found the BF at to be a nice balance!
392174,pike slayer,2009-10-12 15:10:00,1177,"i took them out on the highway and they were surprisingly quiet. they just got a light hummm, you wont even notice unless your listening for it. i drove 80km down the ranger lake road which is a gravel road and im a bit of a crazy driver and they didnt slide out once. and i took a rough bush road for 8km through mud,hills, loose rocks. water. where i normally had to put it in 4x4 i just walked through it in 2wheel drive. out on the lake a blizzard blew in and i had to drive back with a couple inches of snow ontop of all that crap road! they preformed flawlessly and my buddies were like WHAT!?! your still in 2wheel?? they are now sold on them. now its how well they preform on ice and black ice and how long they last."
392230,nobescare,2009-10-12 18:24:00,1,"I'm running a 2005 Toyotal Tacoma Pre-Runner 2WD with a long bed.  I'm debating between the Dunlop Radial Rover RVXT's or the Goodyear Wrangler Territory.  Both avail at Cdn Tire. Has anyone had any luck running either sets.   Most of my driving is Southern Ontario, roads and highways.  Want to be able to use them all year.  What are your thoughts.  I'm leaning towards the Dunlops right now.   Tire size for the truck is recommended - P245/75R/16.  The Territory's only come in a LT254/75R/16.  not sure how the truck will handle with the LT's.   I do like the Mountain Snowflake rating for both tires."
392890,getnjiggywithit,2009-10-14 13:48:00,18,The P means it's a car tire and the LT stands for light truck!
391438,pike slayer,2009-10-09 02:18:00,1177,"Yesterday i went into crappy tire to see if they still had the sale on the goodyear wrangler territory tires which are a cappy tire exclusive. for a set of 4 235 75 15s it came to $635. Boy these tires look mean! such a need lug and aggressive. they are actually pretty quiet and smooth on the blacktop! they got the snowflake snow tire approval on them. if your looking for a set of tires check them out! this weekend i plan on testing them out in the mud, rocks, and water. My buddy is suppose to be guiding me into a walleye/pike lake about 40km north of aubery falls off the 129. We have heard reports that the road is flooded, should be interesting haha!! then maybe next week snow  time to put them to the test!!  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/4/Au...2BTerritory.jsp"
391442,BillM,2009-10-09 02:30:00,17367,"I tried to pick some up for my oldmans truck, not one store has any stock on the 265/75-16 tires, even thought the computers all showed stock.  I might pick up some for my S10, but I'm still partial to the BFG AT's."
391445,pike slayer,2009-10-09 02:34:00,1177,"ive been drooling over the bfg ats all summer saying im gonna buy a set, and i went to western(auto and fishing haha only in the sault) and they quoted me at $780 for a set of 4 and thats cutting me a deal!"
391447,BillM,2009-10-09 02:36:00,17367,"Yeah, they aren't cheap....  and when I see the MT's, I want those even more, lol."
391449,bdox,2009-10-09 03:10:00,329,I'm going to grab the new Wragler DuraTrac before the snow comes. My A/T's are wearing thin and I can get a good price on the DuraTrac in 31x10.5
391495,danbouck,2009-10-09 13:01:00,4380,I like the BFG AT 285 16's for the tahoe but got some blizzaks for the winter. 4x4 WITH winter tires is insane
391501,BillM,2009-10-09 13:57:00,17367," Yup, oldman has a set of winters and runs about 500lbs of sand in the back of his truck.  I need to pick up some steelies and snows for my truck before the white stuff flies."
391508,ecmilley,2009-10-09 14:15:00,2163,"When my goodyear rep seen me about to put bfg at ta's on my truck he offered me the new (at the time) wrangler silent armour and i am glad he did after using them for a year 1/2 now they are the quietest all terrain tire i have ever used and have yet to have any issues getting stuck in all different kinds of terrain, in one test last year my seirra with wranglers against my bosses he had hankook snow tires i had the wranglers i kicked his butt in traction through ice snow and slush (we were all pretty suprised) in the end the biggest advantage over the bfg's is fuel mileage  with the silent armours using kevlar sidewalls the bfg uses triguard sidewalls which are much heavier, but regardless which one's you use there all good tires.  there is a mail in rebate on goodyear tires untilll december 5 /09  www.goodyear.ca"
391527,POLLIWOGG,2009-10-09 15:36:00,835,"Ahhh reminds me of my old self destructing wranglers, they were the good old days. Lots of traction forward and back but if you got sideways on a hill it would slide right to the bottom. I'm sure they are a lot better now."
391538,Fish4Eyes,2009-10-09 16:07:00,1022,Why do people with 4x4's acually spend the money on winter tires? Last winter I was barelling through 3-4' snow piles that the plows would create on minor streets while they were plowing the major streets. Might I add with 40% tread on my all terrains. The people in the neighbourhood loved me as they could follow my track and make it out of the street.
391548,danbouck,2009-10-09 16:39:00,4380, Because 4x4s still need to stop!
391552,BillM,2009-10-09 16:47:00,17367, Pft....  Everyone knows you are invincible in a 4x4!!!!  Ask all the soccer moms bombing down the 400 that end up in the ditch.
391555,Fish4Eyes,2009-10-09 16:59:00,1022, If you drive according to conditions you'll be ok
391560,BillM,2009-10-09 17:14:00,17367, And you'll stop better with snow tires compared to all seasons..  That's not hard to figure out.
391570,anders,2009-10-09 18:48:00,1168, I havent had a problem yet in the winter with mine here in Wawa.  Like someone said...drive according to conditions and you will be ok.
391574,Fish4Eyes,2009-10-09 18:55:00,1022,"I didn't bother arguing. No doubt winter tires do have their benefits, but its not like they make it out to be. I'd rather spend the 700-800$ on fishing equipment  . If you got money to throw around then sure the winter tires are nice, but IMHO they are not a necessity."
391577,BillM,2009-10-09 18:58:00,17367," Yeah, why put your family into a vehicle with inadequate tires for the winter, fishing equipment is much more important.  People slay me when I see someone spend 30k on a new vehicle then complain about spending $700 on snow tires and rims..  To each their own."
391596,Fisherman,2009-10-09 20:17:00,7201,"Amen Bill, some just don't get it."
391599,pigeonfisher,2009-10-09 20:30:00,696,Reality is if you change between your snows and summer tires appropriately then you are doubling the life of each set and it is no more investment.  With the exception of the rims.
391600,danbouck,2009-10-09 20:30:00,4380,"I don't put a price on my family's safety. I am not worried about how we drive, I worry about other peoples driving."
391631,Billy Bob,2009-10-09 22:06:00,5865, Great looking tire for off road but I wonder how loud they are going from one off road track to another.....IMHO they look very noisy..........here's what my TUNDRA has for 4X4 feet........http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tires.jsp?tireMake=Bridgestone&tireModel=Dueler+A%2FT+Revo  Great off road as yesterday proved and quiet on the highway.   Bob
391635,Jer,2009-10-09 22:28:00,1426,"  I have to agree with Ernie on the Silent Armour. He put a set on my truck last year and they are as quiet as any highway tire, quieter than any tire I've had my Malibu for that matter. Last winter, I barely had to use my 4 wheel drive, the traction was that good.     The Wrangler tire originally asked about looks very similar treadwise, I wouldn't be surprised if it's quieter than you think."
