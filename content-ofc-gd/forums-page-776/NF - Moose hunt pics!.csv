392812,TDunn,2009-10-14 03:02:00,680,My cousin Ted was up in Hawk Junction this past weekend hunting moose. Although he never shot the Bull he was very excited to be part of the process.... The bull had a spread of 51 inches but I don't know the weight. From the pictures and from what he has told me it was a bit on the light side for the size of the rack.  Anyways heres a few pictures for the hunters on OFC....        A close encounter with a cow           I hope to be just as successful this year on my first bow hunt for deer on St. joesph Island......keepin my fingers crossed  TDunn
