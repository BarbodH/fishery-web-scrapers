392359,jeffw,2009-10-13 00:33:00,267,Since I saw snow today and its getting cold I figured I would start a thread for first ice guesses. My guess is nov 25. Cheers Jeff
392360,SBCregal,2009-10-13 00:37:00,688,my guess is...too soon
392361,Steel28,2009-10-13 00:38:00,160,December 17
392363,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-13 00:40:00,0,i'll be splake fishing within the first two weeks of december i hope!
392365,Terry,2009-10-13 00:42:00,14456,I say there is ice somewhere now  I think maybe you should pick a lake
392447,jediangler,2009-10-13 11:19:00,1923,I saw on the news last night that they're already looking for a guy who went through the ice with a snow machine out west.
392458,danbouck,2009-10-13 12:05:00,4380,"No ice this year. I'm going to ride my snowmobile to the boathouse, then take the boat out fishing all winter."
392473,Dara,2009-10-13 13:42:00,3052,  That would be nice  
392475,GBW,2009-10-13 13:44:00,8460,I'm going to guess Dec 8 (for my son's b-day) on my lake...
392482,12footspringbok,2009-10-13 14:15:00,459,Hopefully be perching on cooks bay by dec 19th.
392487,Terry,2009-10-13 14:41:00,14456,cooks bay the 18th works for me that's when I start my xmas vacation
392525,DRIFTER_016,2009-10-13 16:12:00,10439,"NOW!!!! The smaller ponds and lakes already have ice. Here's a shot taken last Thursday on a trip south east of here.    I have another trip booked into the community this Friday, so we'll see how much more ice there is."
392543,solopaddler,2009-10-13 16:59:00,8605,  Definitely don't envy you buddy. Not much snow up there yet eh?
392544,Dutchy,2009-10-13 17:03:00,416,I think real early this year. I am going to say november 20th.
392556,DRIFTER_016,2009-10-13 17:36:00,10439,  No snow is good for now. Let's build a bunch of safe ice first and then it can snow so I can get there to make swiss cheese of all those lakes.
392558,anders,2009-10-13 17:38:00,1168, I know that lake!!!
392589,Greencoachdog,2009-10-13 18:50:00,8163,I predict first ice in my glass at about 5:01 pm this evening!!!
392651,Dara,2009-10-13 20:50:00,3052,  shhhh...doc might too if he is serious about Splake at all...I sure have caught some nice ones in there...can't wait for ice now  ...and snow....I'll ride up and see you
392683,irishfield,2009-10-13 22:08:00,26272,"Like many say.. ""it's 5 o'clock somewhere!""... and, like Dawg, there's ice in my drink !"
