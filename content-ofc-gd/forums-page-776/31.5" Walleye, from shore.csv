392813,limeyangler,2009-10-14 03:06:00,5204,"Hi all,  Got an hour of fishing in before sunset in front of the house on Lake Wabigoon.  After a pretty miserable year where the weather has really messed up the fishing for walleye on ""The Goon"", it looks like we are actually getting a normal fall bite, and I have been consistently landing 20""+ fish over the last 2 weeks right off the shore at the bottom of our lawn, about time too....lol.   tonight the lake gave up a rare treasure...and I landed a 31.5"" walleye just as it was getting dark, my PB! I'm buzzing still...with a huge Cheshire cat grin. In all the excitement, I forgot to put the tourney sign in the pic even though I had it right there!...but I was kinda hurrying to get the fish back to the water to fight again another day...which it did  Vid is kinda long and includes a few smaller fish before thebig guy  at the very end.   MY NEW PB WALLEYE              "

392826,Bly,2009-10-14 04:01:00,1556,Congrats!  Not many things sweeter than catching fish like that from shore....especially when the shore line is your yard!
392838,solopaddler,2009-10-14 09:35:00,8605,Wow what a nice fish! Can't remember but do you ice fish in front of your place? I'd be building a hut if you don't have one yet.
