392752,rickster,2009-10-14 00:36:00,495,just got back in from my stand had gotton some apples from a buddies tree and put them out in front of one of my cams the wide nine point came out at sunset and proceeded to eat all the apples while still managing to NOT give me a good broadside shot even if he had I don't think I would have taken the shot as it was a tad to far for the bow although the night was still enough I was able to hear him crunching away on the apples  Maybe next time
