392729,cowanjo,2009-10-13 23:36:00,249,I fish with Cammo braid and mono leader - for some reason  fishing this new braid is not producing - anyone else have an opinion. I tried on weekend one all mono vs braid catch musky  Thanks  John
392754,Rizzo,2009-10-14 00:39:00,4754," I says pardon? anywho, I prefer the braid for trolling with a leader at least 36 inches in length. I like the braid because it shows me the action of my lure, and gives a good hookset just from momentum of boat/fish. Long leader because you want to be bouncing around down there in the rocks/zebra mussles, and fall fish (at least for me) have a habit of rolling themselves up in the line. Not sure if that answered your question"
392757,Roy,2009-10-14 00:52:00,13728,"65lb+ braid with a 130lb  36"" leader is the way to go."
392758,Rizzo,2009-10-14 00:58:00,4754,"oh yeah, the braid I use is 80 lb and leaders 150lb"
392913,fishingisliving,2009-10-14 15:03:00,170,"summer 80lb braid.  fall, 65lb braid, because of slower speeds and fishing deeper (generaly) so the thiner diameter helps put baits lower. but you can use wire line for that as well.  leader, depends where I am fishing. But 130lb flurocarbon is all around a safe bet."
392920,GBW,2009-10-14 15:43:00,8460,"I just started using the Spiderwire cammo and like it a lot.  Casts very well on a spinning reel with 30LB for me. as for musky, heavy + heavy like the others have said..."
