393052,Fishing 24/7,2009-10-14 22:50:00,709,can you make me a wooden senko jaques!  the fish are slow this time of the year!  a scented senko MOUAHAHHA  or a wooden jig head. for flipping!
393058,MJL,2009-10-14 22:57:00,2427,Awesome job Jacques  They look like definite fish catchers to me.  Very tempted to get into making my own plugs for steelhead...You're an inspiration...Or a bad influence depending on how addictive lure making really is
393059,misfish,2009-10-14 23:01:00,29133,"When you going to make an apple one?  I like the frog colors there bud. Like mention,move the hooks and add a tail one."
393065,Leecher,2009-10-14 23:16:00,7832," You're a very funny guy Kev    It's doable but I guaranty those senkos will definitely float   :lol:   Thanks Mike!!!  Give it a try, it's fun to make them and is the ultimate when you catch a fish on them Ohhhh and it's real addictive to say the least   Brian, do you mean color or shape?? LOL Yeah the frog pattern is one of my favorite and attracts fish too!!"
393119,ehg,2009-10-15 01:30:00,2666,"Those are nice looking lures, but definitely you will hook more fish with a treble(dressed) at the back end. Looks like a fun hobby!"
393131,Jonny,2009-10-15 01:56:00,1380,"I don't know if the fish will be hooked, but you sure are!  Nice work, Jacques.  I second the comments about a tail-hook."
393141,perchslayer666,2009-10-15 02:15:00,280,"I'd like to purchase 5 please, how much? Would you be able to paint me a a frog color and minnow color? Would I be able to get them by next week?"
393341,Leecher,2009-10-15 16:30:00,7832," Thanks ehg!!! If I get a deer this year, I will keep the tail and dress some trebles for that.  It's lots of fun making them lures!!!   Thanks Jocko!!!  Yeah you're right.... I'm definitely hooked   Thanks Chancho!!!  Unfortunately those aren't for sale but thanks for asking"
393364,corvette1,2009-10-15 18:01:00,1765,nice work leech try rear hook also
392819,Leecher,2009-10-14 03:23:00,7832,"Hey folks,  This past weekend been busy again on the wooden projects...  Made a 5"" spook that I tested Saturday without painting it.  Wanted to see if I could get any fish to commit but did not get a sniff, so I decided to make a couple more and paint them.  Not sure at this point if it will produce but since the bug I had previously made and tested got positive results, I says to myself, what the hell LOL  So without any further adieu, here are the pics Hope you enjoy!!!                    Leechman"
392820,limeyangler,2009-10-14 03:27:00,5204,"Ok Jacques, i like the handy work, i know what they are, but my wife has just walked past the screen and said....""that just looks wrong"" whilst giggling.....made me laugh too."
392821,Leecher,2009-10-14 03:32:00,7832, Thanks Simon..... but you got to vote
392854,dannyboy,2009-10-14 12:05:00,367,"They look like they will work, what wood are you using for the bodies? My only suggestion would be to use larger hooks but then again I am a large hook kinda guy.  Dan"
392857,bushart,2009-10-14 12:19:00,2628,They'll work---no prob.  Really like the signature on bottom  Bushart
392858,Greencoachdog,2009-10-14 12:29:00,8163,"Ha!!! I told you that you were going to get addicted to making your own baits!!!  They look real good Jacques!!!  I don't think they'll produce too much right now because the water is getting too cold for topwater up there, but I'm sure you'll catch a bunch of fish on them next summer!!!  Keep up the good work!!!"
392859,mbosh1980,2009-10-14 12:30:00,349,looks good!
392861,Harrison,2009-10-14 12:43:00,2202,"Look good bud.  Just a tip, you may want to spread the hooks out a bit.  Even put the last treble in the rear end, add a feathered treble actually to one a see if there is a difference.  Try weighting one in the rear end etc...  Custom baits are very very addicting.  Like the sig too."
392863,BassAsin,2009-10-14 12:48:00,806,i like them jaques they look nice! i dont see why they wouldnt work!
392874,Beans,2009-10-14 13:00:00,3339,Another set of hooks in the rear end...
392884,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-10-14 13:39:00,0,"I agree also. Put some hooks on the end, but more often than often, they will hit that thing dead center. The only thing is that the hooks wil be easier to spit. Give it a shot and get back to us. I'm not sure if bass will be active on the top water at this time of year but the pike and musky will be."
392887,bigugli,2009-10-14 13:40:00,6138,Second set of hooks should be in the rear. Often the strike is a follow/ grab from the tail. You'll miss the short strike.
392908,LeXXington,2009-10-14 14:58:00,1928,Nice going there
392923,Dusky,2009-10-14 15:57:00,310,Nice custom baits!
392926,Whitespinnerbait,2009-10-14 16:03:00,2038,"Since today is gabage day...no they won't work... so just set them on top of your garbage can, And i'll make sure there taken care of ....."
392927,The Urban Fisherman,2009-10-14 16:05:00,2050,"Nice baits Leechman!  I second adding a tail trebble, and the feather is a nice little addition also.  Can't wait to see your results out on the water.  cheers, Ryan"
392997,Fishing 24/7,2009-10-14 19:23:00,709,HEY!  why did you make 3 of them!  is one for me???  never had a spook befor!!!   AWESOME! The master craftmen at work!
393025,Leecher,2009-10-14 21:18:00,7832," Thanks Dan!!!  I use pine for their bodies because it's a softwood and easy to sand down.  For each piece, you're looking at about an hour of sanding to mold it to my likings. The hooks I'm using are Excaliber 6/0.... I think they are good for now.   Thanks Bushart!!!  Me too   Thanks Glen!!!  I think you should pm me you doctors phone number so that I can book an appointment for detox   Thanks mbosh1980!!!  Got your pm and thanks for your suggestion   Thanks Harrison!!!  That's a good point!  The eyelids are screw on type and I use glue on the thread to secure them.... On my next prototype will definitely space them out and put one closer to the end.... Next one will be a jointed one   Thanks Matt!!!   Thanks Beans!!!  That's another possibility!   Thanks Johnny Bass!!!  Will report back the results for sure   Thanks Bruce!!!  That would be the perfect spot for those finicky followers and light biters!"
393026,Leecher,2009-10-14 21:26:00,7832, Thanks LeXX!!!   Thanks Dusky!!!   Hey Paul.... I left one on your door step late last night.... Did you see it on your out this morning??   Thanks Ryan!!!   Thanks Kev!!!  One is for use and the other two are for backup
393027,Roy,2009-10-14 21:29:00,13728,They look like great baits Jacques! You should do well with them. Curious of one thing though...why have you added a 'T' to your sig. on the baits?
393028,jaydub,2009-10-14 21:33:00,145,Looks good Jacques!!    I look forward to watching the video of you walkin those dawgs!
393029,Leecher,2009-10-14 21:40:00,7832," Thanks Roy!!!  Damm... you noticed     No spell checker at hand at the time   :lol: Funny thing is, I only noticed it when I had put the second coat of varnish over   :lol:  OK ""T"" for trademark"
393030,Leecher,2009-10-14 21:43:00,7832, Thanks Jay!!!  Yes I will make another video of it soon I hope
393031,xkempx,2009-10-14 22:07:00,84,"Good wood work. Next time you need to use an Exterior wood finsh varathane, A nice air bush would look good to. next investment for ya.  I'll like it."
393035,Leecher,2009-10-14 22:13:00,7832, Thanks xkempx!!!  My father in law has one of those air brush..... may be I can borrow it for the next bacth!
