393322,DRIFTER_016,2009-10-15 15:45:00,10439,  I could use one of those on my boat!!! Where did your friend get it? Custom made? How many $$$$
392259,ld17,2009-10-12 19:45:00,319,I'm looking into buying a deep v boat and would like opinions on single or dual consoles.  Do people that have the single wish they went dual and dual wish they had single.  More protection vs more room.  Thanks
392261,Roy,2009-10-12 19:51:00,13728,That'd be a toss up and a personal decision. I run a tiller...I don't feel that I need protection from the elements.....I'm not 80 yet.
392262,cram,2009-10-12 19:59:00,1733,"if you like to walk around the boat a lot when you're fishing, single console is great.  i personally prefer dual console....so much nicer for the passenger."
392263,bassjnkie,2009-10-12 20:03:00,1101,"I have the single, more room is a plus for me."
392264,SlowPoke,2009-10-12 20:03:00,2984,"I have a single (center console) and there are many times I'd like a full windshield and top. I'm currently refurbishing mine and I spotted a full windshield on sale (50% off). Thought about it, planned for it and when I went to pull the trigger, it was out of stock. I would probably be better suited with a full windshield and top because while I'm not 80, sometimes I feel that way. Having the windshield and top can extend your fishing day... those cold rainy spring and fall days are much more comfortable. If you're casting 80% or better, a top might be a pain in the butt all the time.  What kind of fishing do you do and what size boat are you looking at?"
392269,glen,2009-10-12 20:33:00,2641,In november i want a sealed cabin with heat.  In july i will take a single console.
392285,Radnine,2009-10-12 21:10:00,1538,"I have a single and love the room and the ability to run about. While there are times I envy the full top full winshield crowd (mostly when I am a passenger in my own boat), I have never wished that I went the other way. There really is a lot of room in a single. Jim"
392315,misfish,2009-10-12 22:41:00,29133,"It all depends if you like the company you bring out with you. I know I always liked a bit of a shield infront of me, when I was the company."
392317,Terry,2009-10-12 22:51:00,14456, yeah DC all the way
392318,Cast-Away,2009-10-12 22:56:00,790,"I was thinking about a side console until I spoke to my wife who also wanted to sit behind a windshield! Are you making the decision just for you, or is there a Mrs. LD17?"
392320,scugpg,2009-10-12 23:00:00,1373,I run a tiller and I enjoy the space....I think it depends how big of water you fish on whether it's really needed. If most of your fishing is the great lakes or LSC than I'd consider it. Inland lakes I'd brave the elements.
392323,Pigeontroller,2009-10-12 23:06:00,2793,"Was on Pigeon Lake last weekend in a cold driving rain...Boat was doin about 30 mph, I was ducked behind the full windshield telling my Brother how much I hated it!(sarcasm)"
392324,bigugli,2009-10-12 23:13:00,6138,Even with a side console one can put up a full top on the boat.   Works quite well on my friend's Legend
392325,greenfshrmn,2009-10-12 23:14:00,65,"I owned a bassboat for 15 years with a dual console.  Protection from the elements for your passenger, and a safe, handy glovebox for keys, wallet, gloves, sunglasses etc. I now own a single console 17ft Lund and really miss that glovebox, and my passengers keep reminding me of how windy it is, even at 40 mph. Anything smaller than 18ft and I don't think you have enough room for that second console.  Personally I don't care for the full windshields, I feel they really cut down on the space to move around, especially when 2 anglers are getting up at the same time  It's all a matter of personal choice, of course.  If you mainly fish alone, then don't bother...if you have kids, they definately need protection.  Good luck with whatever choice you make."
392326,uglyfish,2009-10-12 23:15:00,981,"if your gonna have friends and family out with u more often then not, go with the duel console. i can tell u that it is so much nicer being in a boat knowing there is a little protection for the passenger!! and if u have kids, they will enjoy the trip much more having some protection from the wind!"
392329,BUSTER,2009-10-12 23:19:00,1336,"full windshield with top for spring,summer or fall. early morn spring ,summer ,fall is cool to cold, and mid day summer the sun just kills me. windshield cause i dont like eating bugs anymore, and we beach the boats , it's all sand so we normally dont use a dock, so the guy sitting in the pass. seat with a single console gets sand blasted in the face at top speed, from everyone getting in and out of the boat off the bow."
392330,danbouck,2009-10-12 23:27:00,4380,"I looked at a single console, but then I looked at my wife and bought the full windshield    I am sure glad I did because I don't have to worry about the weather.  BTW took the wife out for a 20km cruise today on erie and stayed nice and warm"
392337,Radnine,2009-10-13 00:00:00,1538, I think that this is sound advice. Size (in this case) does matter. Jim
392383,ld17,2009-10-13 01:37:00,319,"great advice guys thanks.  I guess the boat would be in the 17.5-18 foot range.  I really don't like the look of a full windshield, but do like the look of the dual with sport shield.  I like that you get more room with just one console but realize 2 gives more protection.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  I just would hate to make a mistake.  I do fish with my wife from time to time so I'm sure she'd like the protection.  Ok looks like I will end up going for the dual in the end.  Thanks again."
392478,Flappn,2009-10-13 13:52:00,245,If you have a wife or a friend go Dual. If you don't you will regret it. We live in Canada not the Carolina's.
393056,Tybo,2009-10-14 22:54:00,1373,  Was out in a Friends boat this weekend. When we got back to shore. We all agreed to bring my boat next time.
393075,FISHINGNUT,2009-10-15 00:01:00,253,"My first boat was a tiller great on nice days.Now I have the full windshield and foul weather top wouldnt buy another boat without it.Early and late in the season is really when you notice the biggest difference ,been fishing many a time up at the cottage when my buddies have headed in with there boats way before us just to get out of the elements, I just put the top up and keep fishing.Plus I do 99% of my fishing with someone else in the boat so that was a consderation too when I bought it.Mine is 17.5 ft and have plenty of room even with the top on"
393147,The Urban Fisherman,2009-10-15 02:22:00,2050,Depends if your single or not. My wife said I could spend 20 plus grand on a boat someday but it better have a console for her... Fair enough if you ask me.
393223,mbac31,2009-10-15 10:47:00,904,Dual Console for sure. Single console is kinda like washing your feet while still wearing your socks. Lol
393287,taper,2009-10-15 14:02:00,611,"I own a dual and love it, but the extra room would be nice especially when fighting larger fish. If you plan on taking any woman or kids I would stick to the extra protection."
