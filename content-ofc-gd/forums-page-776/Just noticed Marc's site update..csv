393211,Marc Thorpe,2009-10-15 09:24:00,621,"No worries Wayne,you will be there I really dont bother much with my site and send the stuff off to the due who handles it.  I'd rather talk with fish and battle Big Evil than play the internet game Although I like schooling folks sometimes  I will take care of it this winter,lots of pics to add and Quotes from the boat ""Nothig personal,but I am about to ruin your lunch""  ""its blowing like a bus load of fairies""  The definition of insanity: Doing something over and over expecting different results ""I fish with allot of sick people""  You like my new logo on the enter page Fits my character  "

393215,irishfield,2009-10-15 09:35:00,26272,I think we were surviors that week... going to get the truck and trailer each day...and looking under the truck frame for bombs! Nothing like a nice relaxing fishing trip.....
393217,Marc Thorpe,2009-10-15 09:37:00,621,"Ya but Dude,you are fishing with the immortal one That must have something to do with my Swarthy,Chiseled features  I got a bigger Truck now,should be bomb resistant"
393233,darsky,2009-10-15 11:20:00,586,Wayne you slimed up your leather aviation jacket. Now when you fly-you can smell muskie on your trip. And Marc I still can't figure out how you manage to get up in your truck.Roy-you'll need a ladder!
393235,Roy,2009-10-15 11:27:00,13728,"Darren, I ride in the boat....fresh air is good for you."
393244,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-15 12:16:00,0,  Its funny to hear you talk about 'your big girl'. We all know that who ever gets in Marcs boat is allowed to reel in a couple of his fish. I got to reel one in. My buddy Pete as well. Of course Marc made us loose the big one that day....
