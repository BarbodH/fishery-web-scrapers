392925,The Urban Fisherman,2009-10-14 16:02:00,2050,"nice steelie dude!  what camera did you use for those underwater shots?  There's no a whole lot you can do if the water is stained like that, short of getting closer to the fish.  And using a flash is pretty much useless because it will light up all the little particles floating in front of your fish!  good work!  Ã‡heers, Ryan"
