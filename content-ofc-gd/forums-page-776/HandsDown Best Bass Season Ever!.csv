392594,Fishing 24/7,2009-10-13 19:06:00,709, 5.1 lbs actualy.  20 1/2 inches long.  no girth tho.  for some sstupid reason that bass isnt fall feeding  but she was LONG.  and very Wide.  the strongest fish i had to fight yet.  it went under the boat 4 times.  thought my 12 lbs mono would snap.... good thing i wasnt in my alum boat.  those rivets can cut the mono like butter.
