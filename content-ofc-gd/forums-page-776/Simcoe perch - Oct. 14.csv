My friend and his friend visiting him from Switzerland all had great time...nice sunny day almost no wind until 2pm. Not many boats around either. Magic depth was 30', we used mostly minnows today. Ended up with over 100 perch between all of us. God some nice big ones too. Lots of laughs for all. Here are couple shots:      Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
