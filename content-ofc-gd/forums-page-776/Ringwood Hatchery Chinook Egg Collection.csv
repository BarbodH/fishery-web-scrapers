393288,canadadude,2009-10-15 14:05:00,769,"A true  MNR biologist in the making, god help recreational fishing in this province. Don't these dudes get it we are paying the bills, your salaries, and getting next to nothing for our $$$$ from the all mighty MNR biologists."
393328,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-15 15:59:00,0,"the sense of entitlement is choking out the air in here. thankfully there are wonderful bios out there who don't treat lake ontario like their own private stocked fish pond.  we in sault ste. marie enjoy an awesome recreational atlantic salmon fishery.  they are awesome to catch, fight harder than stink, and some of you might enjoy them if you gave them a chance to re-establish!"
393332,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-15 16:04:00,0,"and once again, i'll say that i think it's awesome what has happened at ringwood hatchery.  seeing a private and volunteer based project such as this release fish in the big O must be incredibly rewarding for all involved...i just got thrown off topic by a stupid t-shirt and it has unfortunately remained off topic. for this i apologize to the thread author."

393358,canadadude,2009-10-15 17:39:00,769,"Perhaps you should give a thankyou to the wonderful Soo Michigan USA biologists and the University of Soo Michigan for 20yrs of painstaking reaserch and millions of $$$$$$$ to create a somewhat established fishery. May I also say without the continued work of an entire University reserch staff this re-established fishery is doomed to die off, like every other Atlantic re-established fishery in the Great Lakes has."
393359,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-15 17:50:00,0," I do give thanks to the Lake Superior State University  bios for all the work they've done including research on atlantic salmon, lamprey, lake sturgeon...etc."
393362,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-15 17:58:00,0,in fact here is their website! http://www.lssu.edu/arl/ i recommend the fishcam!  there you can watch the seasonal delights of the st. mary's river...you might even get to see some chinnies and atlantics swimming together!
393365,CLofchik,2009-10-15 18:02:00,854, Naturally being as informed & educated as you believe yourself to be you are aware that Atlantics are only native to Lake O and not the Soo right? That pesky Niagara Falls kept getting in the way of migrations. Have you any idea what the costs are to provide that non-reproducing put & take Atlantic fishery? How greater an impact on recreational fishing those funds would be if directed to much more suitable sportfish instead of using Lake Huron as a private science experiment?   Heaven forbid the ministry that manages recreational fishing actually put an emphasis on recreational fishing instead of the self serving delusions of a very few appointed public servants.  You sir are the embodiment of why that shirt was created...and still don't get it.
393366,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-15 18:08:00,0,"can't you take an apology and let your own thread get back on topic?  start an atlantic thread! i'm done talking to brick walls.  you're the most abrasive person i've encountered on this forum, and unlike guys like GCD, you don't do it to be funny.  you ACTUALLY think you're smarter than biologists.  i'm no bio, but i trust them over a hillbilly with an attitude any day.  thread done."
393368,troutologist,2009-10-15 18:20:00,951,"Does the MNR stock Atlantics in Lake Huron?  Science sucks lets continue to let the party in power make kneejerk reactions to lobbiests.  The best way to ensure better long term fisheries management is to take all the money from any scientists and give it to CO's. The CO's will be happy as their job will get real easy due to the lack of fish.  Seems like enrollment should be up in biology faculties at Ontario Universities. Since the currently trained group of biologist can't seem to manage our fisheries appropriately, most of you will be wanting to take courses to make a difference yourself, armed with actual scientific training and tools versus, the word of a TV personality.      Cheers to the volunteers who provide time and resources to ensure these programs continue, they are the ones who deserve a hats off. They lead by example and so should be applauded."

390526,CLofchik,2009-10-06 02:13:00,854,"As some may or may not know, the MNR got out of the chinook salmon business.  Faced with the very real possibility that salmon fishing could come to an end in Lake Ontario a volunteer group offered to take over the operation of Southern Ontario's last hatchery that raised King Salmon.  Metro East Anglers took over the operation in a deal brokered by the OFAH, aye they be a motley crew but if it wasn't for them there wouldn't be ANY Kings on this side of the lake.  http://www.ringwoodhatchery.ca/  This week is their 3rd annual egg collection, and as usual was a blast with the river stuffed with tons of ripe fish.  How they are collected is fish are zapped with an electroshocker (Taser for fish), then netted and put in pens.    Milt and eggs are collected from the fish.    There's always a wide sampling of different groups that all have salmon in common, from trollers on Spoonpullers to a Chinese anglers club showing up to help out.  Heck even a senior MNR biologist can come down and be educated in proper lake management & welcomed in our special fashion    Eggs back at the hatchery just after insemination, a small number of the crew.  The tall stately looking gentlemen with the beard is Andy, whose done an outstanding job operating the hatchery, heh I guess his retirement hasn't exactly panned out how he planned.    Finished eggs in incubation trays after a long days work, rest up future 30lb'ers      They'll hatch in a few weeks, get transferred to tanks and start feeding like wolves, until they're stocked as fry in March.  Hard to beleive that every 20lb. King caught started out as these little guys getting put in a lake.     And now y'all now how salmon get into Lady O.  Oh and coho collections are done in October, but without any Ho's stocked for a few years finding numbers of ripe fish can be hit or miss.  If anyone can PM a line on where there's some decent Ho #'s it would be appreciated."

390920,rhare,2009-10-07 10:59:00,387,"  what part of this are you directing that comment to??       I was down on the weekend to do my part too, had an excellent collection getting almost 500,000 over 2 days. A couple beauty browns where also transported up past the dam to better spawning grounds. here are some more pics of the collection.     My hat goes off to the members of the chinese angles association. They had over 10 people out getting their hands dirty and helping out. The most impressive part is they dont even fish salmon!! The group focus is on bass and walleye but they still came out and put in time to help the king fishery. Incredible group or anglers!!!         collecting some prime genetics, and trying not to get any on my jacket!    some of the 30lbs males sampled this weekend   "
390997,tonyb,2009-10-07 16:05:00,1637,"Dr. S...clearly you don't know the story behind the shirt.  Great to see the success of this years egg collection.  I heard that they are ahead of schedule which means lots of ripe fish...where were all those matures about a month ago!?  Wow...Bruce isn't a small lad, so that king he is holding is certainly 30++!  Matt's fish has that super sized adipose fin, typical of the tyee's in the lake as well (although they won't be visible on anything but naturally reproduced fish in the coming years)  Hats off to all volunteers...I miss the fun and enjoyment of the event and might have to replace my neoprene waders with another pair of cheap ones.  I bought breathable waders after a big male ripped my waders at the '07 collection (hey! what's that tingling?? UH OH! had to get outta the water fast!), and since then haven't been able to get in the water with the electro-shocker...on the list for sure...  Tony"
