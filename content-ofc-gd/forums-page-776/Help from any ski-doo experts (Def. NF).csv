392283,Sandbag,2009-10-12 21:08:00,533,"First off...happy thanksgiving to our Canadian members  I have a 1999 Ski doo MXZ 600. On the last couple of rides of the season last year, I noticed a slight squeal from the clutch side of my machine. The squeal only started after riding for 15-20 minutes and would stay for the duration of the ride. If the machine sat for a while and I rode again, it would not squeal until 15-20 minutes into the ride again.  The squeal was only present when the track was turning. ie sitting still and idling I could not hear it. If I lifted the back of the sled and the track was turning, the squeal could be heard. I have picked up new bearings for driveshaft and jackshaft and intend on changing them this week.  My question; is there anything else I should be looking at?  There does not seem to be any diminished performance when the squeal is present, just trying to avoid any mid-season issues.  Thanks for any/all opinions  Cheers  Craig"

If it's worn there may not be enuf width and it's slipping when the primary and secondary drives are fully compressed. Look for black rubber buildup on the clutch plates and measure the width of the remaining belt compared to a new belt.  If everything seems okay there then I'd look at the bearings on the top of the secondary drive next.  JF

393090,Greencoachdog,2009-10-15 00:19:00,8163,You should ditch the ski-doo as of yesteryear!!!...they don't run well when not on snow yanno!!!... 2 strokes sux azz!!!
393092,Whitespinnerbait,2009-10-15 00:21:00,2038,Squealing noise equals  Belt slipping / out of alignment etc etc  A bearing wouldn't ''Squeal '' to long without flying apart soon afterwards...
393384,ecmilley,2009-10-15 18:56:00,2163,most likely a worn belt but it can also be worn clutch bushings jack shaft bearing bad motor mounts alignment issues without being there and checking it myself there is so many things it can be. also do not use sand paper at all to clean clutches use only fine or xtrafine scotchbrite pads and acetone then blow dry
