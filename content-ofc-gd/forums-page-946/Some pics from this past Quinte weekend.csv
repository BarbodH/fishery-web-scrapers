263346,Badger Shark,2008-10-30 17:31:00,291,Here are some pics of a few of the fish from this weekend.                    Here is a shot of the cement ship that was cruising by at warp speed.   Here is a shot of us towing Karma and Jackel back to the harbour.    It wouldnt be a Quinte outing without me getting the wool pulled over my eyes!    Here is Sheldon flying by us at top speed!            Not the best weekend out there but hey alot of fun and worth going just for the seminar alone. Thanks again Sheldon for a very informative lesson.  Till the next outing lets hope the eyes start to loosen their jaws a bit more.

263540,corvette1,2008-10-31 12:47:00,1765,nice eyes congrats
263546,limeyangler,2008-10-31 13:16:00,5204,"Truly awesome. Everytime i see reports of the BOQ i'm always in awe of the number of big...i mean HUGE walleye there, congrats on what looks like a great day on the water...great fish porn too!"
263597,Badger Shark,2008-10-31 18:01:00,291," It was funny, they hit on different things from reef runners and the usual suspects to stickbaits.  Basically we just covered alot of water, looked for schools and high baitballs and worked them for a long time.  We never really got on any particular pattern.  It seems that these fish just turn on for a short amount of time so hopefully you are on the right school when it happens.  Are you going to be at the OFC get together,  we will more than likely be on Quinte when you guys are there so hopefully we will see you."
263599,tdotfisherman,2008-10-31 18:04:00,317,"What a bunch of hogs, thanks for sharing!"

263723,GbayGiant,2008-11-01 01:13:00,1780,"Very nice, some good looking golden fish there."
263728,Badger Shark,2008-11-01 01:28:00,291,"  Will do, we will make sure it is the Purdiest one!"
