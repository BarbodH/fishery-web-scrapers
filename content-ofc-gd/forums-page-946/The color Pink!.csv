263783,Greencoachdog,2008-11-01 13:17:00,8163,I have great success with pink lures in colder water temperatures!  ... but wearing it while fishing???    Looks like it worked for this Old Fart when he caught the world record Brown Trout!
263787,limeyangler,2008-11-01 14:05:00,5204,"Thats not pink...thats ""cinnamon sunset"".....lol"
263791,Mike the Pike,2008-11-01 14:21:00,3421,Alot of these fish were caught on a Pink rapala X-Rap.       Thats the lucky lure.             The Rapala I used had a Pink belly.  I must say Pink is a colour that does catch fish.  MTP
263800,Marko,2008-11-01 15:45:00,854,Salmon and trout love pink as well.
263803,steverowbotham,2008-11-01 16:20:00,1800,I frequently use pink for smallmouth
263805,lew,2008-11-01 16:26:00,12767,"My single most productive musky bait this year has been the 9"" strawberry Sledge and it's probably accounted for at least 35 fish alone.  I also use walleye & sucker patterned Sledges but they don't do nearly as well.  Don't know if it's the white color or the pink spots but together they work great, infact I'm gonna re-paint a perch colored Double ""D"" in the same pattern.  Unfortunately, the snot rocket pike also like the Strawberry flavour but I spose we need to take the bad with the good  "
263810,GbayGiant,2008-11-01 17:22:00,1780,"I got a couple pink bucktails tails and big soft plastic baits that do good on pike/musky , and do good on pink Jigs for walleye/bass."
263816,jediangler,2008-11-01 18:05:00,1923,This perch was caught on a 1/16oz pink tubejig. 
263824,EC1,2008-11-01 18:54:00,930,pink tubes with white sparkly tentacles for the WIN . catches ANYTHING
263830,bassfighter,2008-11-01 19:21:00,366,"Pink colored lures is all I have been hearing that was effective color for cold water application lately.  Isn't pink made up of Red and white? where red colors is the first color to disappear within 2 feet off the subject, while white is one of the best all around color. Combining the two color, Should pink somewhat disapear after certain distance as well? I am confuse! It can't be more visible than white alone?"
263895,jwl,2008-11-02 00:10:00,1056,"yepper, pink works pretty good, as for wearing it, I dunno, I would probably get pushed in the water by the guys I fish with"
263904,l2p,2008-11-02 00:32:00,346,"heres one from today, pretty in pink?  "
263906,Rich,2008-11-02 00:35:00,3927,"Pink buzzbaits.. they're like platinum. If you can find them, let me know!"
263920,lookinforwalleye,2008-11-02 01:36:00,4399,Pink is a very good colour for Bog Bass!
263951,sharper,2008-11-02 05:07:00,279,Pink colored xraps is something I'm planning to purchase real soon.
264199,Reel Nauti Pirate,2008-11-03 04:30:00,52,Hell Yes! It was one of the hottest colors we tested this season. Here is some fish porn  
264321,Bitsmith2k,2008-11-03 16:56:00,396, i'll second that!
264344,The Urban Fisherman,2008-11-03 18:20:00,2050,"Pink X-Rap works great for smallies, largies and pike in stained water... (go-to lure in the Thames River)  Pink powerbait trout worms for trout and bluegill in clear water situations... (Reservoir gills and bows)"
264350,timmeh,2008-11-03 18:34:00,609,Whenever I throw pink sencos for bass i can't keep the pike off of them. i almost always need to attach a leader to so they don't keep stealing them.
264380,snag,2008-11-03 21:33:00,1932,"Well Red,  I've seen you sun burnt to a commie ""pink"" shade. .....and you catch lotsa fish,... so the answer is,  Yes."
