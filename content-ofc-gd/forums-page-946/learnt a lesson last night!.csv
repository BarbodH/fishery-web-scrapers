263601,ctdd2006,2008-10-31 18:14:00,531,".....Bring your neoprene chest waders this time of year to assist in hooking up the boat to the trailer!  I went fishing alone yesterday afternoon hunting walters and jumbos....had a great afternoon, a couple eyes and a bucket full of keeper perch for the table.  The fun part began when attempting to load the boat in 20 km winds and a deep launch.  Like a dummy, I thought I could ""tight rope"" the tongue to latch on and SPLASH!  That 46 degree water made for the 60km drive home interesting!  Good thing I didn't get pulled over! lol!  Pics to follow (I hope)....camera is drying out!  FYI, I was out @ the mouth of the Spanish River in the North Channel of Lake Huron out in the ""Whalesback Channel/Aird Island area.   Marked lots of fish, caught the eyes trolling in forty feet of water on a large taildancer chub colors and the perch bouncing an 1/8 ounce jig off bottom in a variety of depths tipped with a live dew worm."
263602,misfish,2008-10-31 18:16:00,29133,"Been there,done that. NO FUN AT ALL. Good to hear you made it home."
263604,jwl,2008-10-31 18:35:00,1056,"been there done that too..I think if you do alot of boating, bound to happen once in a while  funny thing is last time that happened to me, I was not alone..but the wussy sucks I was fishing with didn't have any boots on and didn't want to step in the water..poor babies, so I did the same thing from inside my boat after I ran it up on the trailer...had to step off the bow to put the winch strap on..and yepper...slllliiiiippppp  you are not alone man"
263606,bassfighter,2008-10-31 18:46:00,366,"It happened to many of us. Except................not in cold water!  Now you can tell others you have the guts to plunge into cold water, just don't tell them it was an accident!"
263607,Bitsmith2k,2008-10-31 18:55:00,396,"a couple weekends ago i failed at walking the tight rope too.. stupid water was just about 1"" above the top of my boots too..  it happens.."
263611,Greencoachdog,2008-10-31 19:02:00,8163,Ya gotta love being a spectator of the boat launch antics!!!
263616,bigugli,2008-10-31 19:42:00,6138,But the water ain't cold yet!  Been there too. Wait til right after ice out.
263654,fishindevil,2008-10-31 21:55:00,6254,"Like the other members said been there done that!!!!.  ..and after a while i got smart,i now have had for about 5yrs a pair of hip waders in my vehicle at all times,and they come in handy all the time,i will probly be using them tommorow depending where i launch at quinte !!!! got mine at wal-mart for about $25 on sale,so its worth it for sure,nothing worse than a cold drive home,or even worse if you do that before you launch...cheers"
263655,Tootsie II,2008-10-31 22:02:00,162,"Hate to admit it, but Ive done it more than a few times. Now I just wear old running shoes and wade right in if I have to. As one gets a little more mature ( that's polite for ""old""), falls can be more serious. However, it's usually July or August water temp's, and I have spare socks and shoes in the truck."
263658,Tybo,2008-10-31 22:12:00,1373,"Lower Niagara in February. Never have I felt water that cold. Been lucky,Only had one soaker and released many fish."
263660,Bernie,2008-10-31 22:13:00,3190," Ha.Isn't that the truth Glen. Had the pleasure of working at a marina as a teenage kid one summer. Some were appreciative of help, some would ignore me (just a kid).Trailer tongues stuck into a tailgate or a trunk lid was always a popular thing to see. Just don't try this. "
263667,wgk36,2008-10-31 22:35:00,69,Pickeral Park in May.  Water was still mighty cold.  Teaches me to walk backwards on a dock.  Friends still call me Spongebob
263668,Tybo,2008-10-31 22:36:00,1373,"Give her some more gas, She'll pull off."
263717,darsky,2008-11-01 00:49:00,586,I have been experimenting with NOT backing in quite as far as I should so I am not over water hopping off the front and I am clear on the last 3 shots. Surprisingly you may not need to put the trailer in as far you normally do. My only concern is usually the prop when I am going up to the roller.Trim up and you will probably be ok and DRY.
263781,johnnyb,2008-11-01 13:10:00,3413,never mind staying dry...by yourself and slipping off the trailer....great way to break an ankle or wrist...good post to remind us how easy it is to think ahead and be safe.
263786,lew,2008-11-01 13:40:00,12767,Never had the misfortune to slip off the boat tongue into cold water.........yet.........but I did fall out of a boat in April one year and that wasn't too pleasant either  Definetely the reason to carry a FULL change of clothes for the drive home.  Here's a nifty little item from Cabellas that bolts onto your trailer tongue and would provide a safer platform to stand on while hooking up the winch strap.  
263898,ctdd2006,2008-11-02 00:22:00,531,That cabela's item is a neat and simple idea.  I bet I can easily make something like that.  Thanks.  Going out tomorrow again....will be smarter.  ps. camera is dead!  I now am an easy person to shop for this christmas!
263905,Rich,2008-11-02 00:33:00,3927,"Ah yes, I've tried watering a few cameras. They never grow into bigger, better cameras like I had hoped."
