The drive up this morning was cold,creeks and shallow lakes had a crust of ice on them.The forecast is not good,rain and warmer temps for the week. Excitement for the mornings drive was I almost got smoked by a flyby grouse on the way up. Cold ones are pretty much gone    it,s  getting close to sandman time. Up at 4 am,will post the days results later monday.  Oh and if my wife is reading this, goodnight deer"
