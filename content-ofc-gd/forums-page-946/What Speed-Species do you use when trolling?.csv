263965,Vanselena,2008-11-02 11:54:00,269,Just wondering if people troll at different speeds.  On Lake Ontario I troll at 1.6 for Walleye while on Lake Erie 3.0 for Walleye.  How about you?  Thanks
263971,Guest gbfisher,2008-11-02 13:05:00,0,Im a troller Vans. Speeds from .8 to 8 mph usually.......and sometimes fasterr.....depends what I'm fishin fer. But that covers all species for me.

On the smaller boats, tiller or console idling to slow, using the electric speeds 1 to 4. Haven`t trolled much over the last 20 years or so but it can be very effective."

Generally start slow in the spring, faster in the summer, dead slow in late fall, just follow the water temp but you never know. The water temp, how deep you want your bait, cold fronts, lure action ect... it all plays a part in speed."
