263066,BillM,2008-10-29 18:11:00,17367,"Hey guys,  I am heading up to the Saugeen on Friday to take my first crack at float fishing, along with picking up a used float setup.  Can anyone give me some hints on what to bring as far as bait/terminal tackle?  The fella who is going to show me the ropes has generously said not to worry about it, but I'd feel a lot better if I could bring my own terminal tackle to lose and not his  So here is a list that I currently have, please add to it if possible.  Floats - Any specific weight I should be looking for?  I have some blackbird plastic floats currently, should I get some wood ones also?  Splitshot - Is there such thing as float specific shot or will normal lead sinkers work? (I'e heard pencil lead is easier to work with and lasts longer)  Swivels - I know they should be black, but should I pick up the ones with bearings to get rid of the line twist I know I'll have? lol  Leader material - will normal Flour do? or do I specifically need leader flouro?  Bait - I'm planning on bringing some roe (if I can find any), some single egg flies, some pink worms...  Anything else? (egg sucking leech perhaps?)  Hooks - any specific size/brand I should look at?  I'll also tie up some leaders before hand, I've read about 18-24inch leaders, stick with lengths in this range?  Sorry for the barrage of questions, I just wanna make sure I atleast have what I need on friday, cause I'm sure I'll be all wrapped up in line most of the day"
263075,kemper,2008-10-29 18:43:00,2232,"Blackbird plastic float should be fine  splitshot- you can find blackbird splitshot in small sizes at most bait shops, there is also some steelhead shot that I hear of but have never seen/used. I use blackbird BB2, and BB4 although I would like to find some a bit smaller  swivels- micro swivels, they dont have a ball bearing more like a cartridge. They are small, im not sure how to describe them other that they are the smallest swivels you have ever seen. Cant remember which brand I buy  Leader material- maxima ultragreen in 4 lb. Nothing beats it, nothing.  bait- you got it, roe is key so are jigs (try riverwood)  hooks- only one kind ever touches my float line, Daiichi in number 10 or 12."
263081,BillM,2008-10-29 18:51:00,17367,"You rock man, I really appreciate it."
263083,tonyb,2008-10-29 19:02:00,1637,"Diamond Hook sharpener!  If you can't get Daiichi hooks, I personally like the #8 Gamakatsu Octopus hooks  Cork floats in a larger size will be good if you are fishing deep/heavy current and need to load up with shot to get your bait down.  Kemper has a good handle on the gear, I concur regarding leader material.  If it is crystal clear water or pressured, you can get away with 4 or even 6lb flourocarbon."
263087,silvio,2008-10-29 19:14:00,433,Bill I sent you a pm call me after 6 all tell you everything you need.
263091,bassjnkie,2008-10-29 19:39:00,1101,"I`m not a pro steelheader, this is what I recommend,  Shot - Raven dispencer at Bass pro $9.99 for most shot pattern - AAA to #8  Swivels - Bass pro - Blackbird 20 or so in a pack, there tiny  Hooks size #10 - #16, I like the Daiichi (as mentioned), Gama Octopus, and raven octopus, specialist or Sledge.  Leader - any flouro will do 4lb, I like to use a tippet material it's very thin.  Bait - Looks like you have it covered  Floats - The blackbird ones you have a good.  Hope this helps"
263099,Uncle Buck,2008-10-29 19:54:00,1000,"a couple of things...  1. if you're gonna buy a chest pack, don't get the one with the 2 packs that go over the shoulder, get the one that has one pack in the center it keeps it out of the way when reeling in  2. for roe, get the one without the floatation"
263109,solopaddler,2008-10-29 20:11:00,8605,"  Bill I fish the Saugeen quite a bit. Before you waste the trip make sure you've got fishable water. Right now it's very much blown. It's a big river with a lot of volume. Long leads with lots of shot and larger floats in the 11-15 gram range are the norm. Personally I'd never run a plastic float on the 'geen, only larger balsa floats. The most readily available are the larger sized Riverwood floats. Water will be off coloured or at the least a very deep green colour. Fluoro doesn't cut it for me in those high water conditions. I'd recommend Maxima Ultragreen in 5 or 6lb test. Go big or go home! Hooks are sized appropriately to the bait you're running. Smaller hooks in the 10-12 range for normal sized roe bags. Larger hooks in the for bigger bags (which is what you should be running on Friday). If the water is clear enough live worms under a float are deadly on the Saugeen. That's live worms, not pink plastic ones  . Don't be afraid to throw larger spinners in sizes 2-3 and 1/4oz spoons. Cast across and slightly upstream, let sink for a bit then a slow retrieve. On big water like the 'geen sometimes hardware outproduces all. Finally, it's a big river don't be intimidated by it. Break the water down into sections and try to interpret where the various seams are. Sometimes they're sitting right in tight, sometimes they're way way out there. Fish slowly and thoroughly and don't get rooted in one spot. Go for a walk if nothing is happening."
263117,fishindevil,2008-10-29 20:29:00,6254,"Hey bill mike says that,like he almost knows what hes doing !!!lol..lol.  . just kidding man..  .i think if you follow his leads there that you will be into fish for sure !!!!good-luck"
263124,kemper,2008-10-29 21:01:00,2232,"  there is a chance that i will be at the 'geen this friday as well. Not too sure yet, I have to see what my gas money looks like as I have to drive all the way back home (oshawa) that night instead of just driving back to guelph. And its a long damn drive lol.  Might have to setting for getting up early and doing my usual routine...fishing my way back."
263136,GbayGiant,2008-10-29 21:41:00,1780,"Don't forget your glow sticks or lighted bobbers if your night fishing. The whole 4lbs leader deal is just for show. I use to do that whole thing too even went to 2lbs but it doesn't make much sense, I would stick to 8lbs if you don't want to loose too many, the fish don't care."
263165,kemper,2008-10-29 23:36:00,2232, depends what water you fish. On a normal day in the eastern ditches I think 8 lb would be a struggle.
263264,jdmls,2008-10-30 03:59:00,575,"You have everything covered pretty well  Two things :  1)buy riverwood floats  . Until you learn how to set the hook just enough , you will be constantly hitting yourself in the face or the tree behind you with those clear plastic floats. riverwoods are my fav , but any balsa will do, having a more weight to it than clear plastic and will prevent the wild float launches  2)Pick up some trout worms !!! If the fish are not hitting on roe, your next best bet is worms.  Oh ya and check the flow charts....She seems to be running really high as of right now !!! Dunno if she will be ideal by Friday. but keep checking  put a post up on the grey bruce board regarding the conditions expected by Friday...wouldn't hurt"
263297,solopaddler,2008-10-30 11:51:00,8605,"You won't be fishing the Saugeen tomorrow bud, unless you like fishing in a raging brown torrent LOL! (Just an FYI  )  All of the smaller Huron trib's should be prime though..  Good luck"
263301,DMASSE,2008-10-30 12:14:00,420,Bill  Dont forget the micro plastics llike 1 inch tubes in white and Pink and berkely grubs  I usually hit tons of fish on the geen with these when nothing else is happening.  Also you might want to bring some botton bouncing gear to work the botton by the Indian reserve.  I cant tell you how many fish I hit there using a walking sinker and roe..  If you want more PM me and I will help more if needed  Dave
263329,BillM,2008-10-30 15:46:00,17367,"  Yeah, the hydro chart isn't looking very promising..  Ah well, perhaps I'll be just going up to pick up my float setup, that's better then nothing!  You guys rock with the info, I do appreciate it.  I dunno if I am going to be able to get my hands on roe tonight or not, but I'll be stopping by BPS to pick the rest of the stuff up.  I should have a pretty good selection from all the replies in here  Oh yeah, 'trout' worms are red worms correct?  And not the nightcrawlers I used to use for sunfish as a kid?"
263334,NAC,2008-10-30 16:05:00,369,"The Maitland peaked yesterday afternoon and it really wasn't a hard enough rain to muddy it up that bad anyway.  From what I've seen of it over the past 1-2weeks and what we've got for precip lately combined with the big weather swing, Friday should be perfect.  I'd go there myself, but I'm off to Minden for the next 5 days. Bayfield and Sauble are fishable too.  Good luck wherever you end up!"
263336,BillM,2008-10-30 16:14:00,17367,Thanks man!  The guy who is showing the ropes on Friday said I'll be tangled up with line for the first 15mins or so   Really looking forward to learning a new fishing technique...  I gotta find a place that sells pre-tied roe before I leave work!
263527,Greencoachdog,2008-10-31 11:49:00,8163,If you're going for Steel... you may want to consider one of these.  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...__SearchResults
263725,BillM,2008-11-01 01:17:00,17367,"Well the Saugeen wasn't in bad shape at all today.  High water so the fish had numerous runs to pick from, but the water was far from chocolate milk.  Visibility was about 8-10inchs, the local I hooked up with from the Grey/Bruce forum said if the water was a bit lower, the conditions would be perfect.   About 90% of the fish were caught bottom bouncing from what we could see, with the odd centerpin picking up one here and there.  I gotta admit, I was intimidated by the centerpin, but had to down pat in about 10mins or so.  By the end off the day, I was casting as far as my partner for the day (who's been doing it 15 years)..  I realize centerpins aren't meant to be bombed, but it felt pretty good making decent drifts along with some seasoned vets.  The guy I hooked up with was absolutely great, we instantly clicked and I have a feeling we'll be fishing together quite often.  I am proud to say that I did land a shaker about 2-3lbs!!!!!!   I think I impressed the local (although it was all #$&* luck) by landing the first fish I ever had on.  He told me he had about 15 hookups before he landed his first on a centerpin.  I am sure if mine had some size, I wouldn't have landed it, but controlling the drag with only your finger is a pretty cool feeling.   The fish ran at me a few times and I had to hustle to bring up the slack, but all worked out well.  I'll have the pic in a few days as it wasn't taken with my camera..  Learned quite a lot about reading the water and my float setup and how it reacts if it's to long, or to short, or not heavy enough etc.  I caught the shaker on a pink Berkely power worm with a pretty decent lead, probably 5ft or so.  I'll be heading down to the Notty tomorrow morning to see if I can hook into a few more fish."
263730,GbayGiant,2008-11-01 01:32:00,1780,"Way to go, good luck tomorrow. Actually those little shakers are probably harder to keep hooked and land than a 10lber, good work."
263732,Canuck2fan,2008-11-01 01:43:00,1444," Congrats on catching your first steelie on a pin.  Now that you have the dreaded disease and are hooked I will give the best tip you can get for steelheading..... Before you leave home in the comfort and warmth thereof take a few pieces of 1/2"" pipe insulation cut the exact length of a pocket you wish them to go into. PRE TIE about 7 hooks to your leader material (extra long as you can always shorten it for the conditions) per piece of pipe insulation and wrap them around it secure the line to the insulation with small pieces of tape. I actually use the smallest pre cut labels Staples sells for doing this. I always carry at least 3 pieces of the insulation so that I have around 20 hooks pre tied, (very useful when my Dad who is too arthritic to retie himself and my neighbor can't see well enough are fising with me) On the tribs with zebra mussels on the bottom it is not uncommon to have to retie 4 to 5 times per person.  If you are going to fish Lake Huron tribs you will find this an invaluable aid, when it is dark, 30 below and or the wind is gently wafting along at 50KMP."
263733,BillM,2008-11-01 01:50:00,17367,"You know what, that makes perfect sense...  I pre-tied some leaders yesterday, wrapped them up and wouldn't you know it, when I needed one today they were all in a giant knot  I am going to rig up some shot line also,  I hate being out in a not so well footed area trying to pinch splitshot onto my line"
263750,KelfuN,2008-11-01 04:36:00,246,"sorry to go off topic abit..since this is a steelhead advice thread  today i was 0/3. first fish it was a bad hookset, second fish my leader line broke, third fish i have NO CLUE what happened..i had it jumping out of the water a few times, a few acrobatics then my hook just came off when i was about to land it.  is it normal to lose 3 steelheads in 1 day?? or i just suck."
