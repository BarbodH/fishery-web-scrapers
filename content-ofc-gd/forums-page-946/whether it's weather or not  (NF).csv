263963,Terry,2008-11-02 11:20:00,14456,"so for years I got the weather from the local news cast on the evening news  then the weathernetwork on cable then the weathernetwork on the internet  but it seemed they never did a good job of predicting the conditions, even just a few hours away, but long range forcast must have been with a spin of a prize wheel......tomorrow....click..click ...click...dry and warm   http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/CAON0078?CAON0078  well after looking around I find accuweather to be the better place to get my weather  http://www.accuweather.com/canada-weather-...lcode=L3Z%201A1  the weather office is good too but not as many locations   http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/city/pages/...5_metric_e.html  so who do you get your weather from and how do you rate them"
263966,lew,2008-11-02 12:05:00,12767,"When I'm at the trailer near Peterboro I use CHEX TV and here at home it's usually the Weather network. Their both fairly accurate for a day or 2 but after that it's usually hit & miss.  When we were on the St. Lawrence last Monday afternoon, they said Tuesday would be a decent day with a chance of showers in the afternoon.......perfect  3 hours later, they said OOPS...........the chance of showers for tomorrow afternoon has now been changed to a major snowstorm with 12"" of snow and wind gusts to 70K.  I dunno, but it seems to me if there's a huge snow storm sitting on the horizon and and less than 24 hours away they should be able to pick it up with more accuaracy than they do now.  Or does a chance of showers and a major snowstorm look the same on a radar screen ??   Years ago I'd check the weather forecast before a fishing trip, but now I just go fish'n no matter what they say, but pack shorts, suntan lotion, rain suit and a winter parka just in case"
263968,Guest gbfisher,2008-11-02 13:00:00,0,Ummm Terry.....You should already be in the boat..or at least at Tim Horton's picking up rations for the day and if yer ride isn't awake and ready to go...you should be waking him up.......... Dont worry about the weather. It's ALWAYS different on the bay.  GO FISH!!
263969,Greencoachdog,2008-11-02 13:02:00,8163,"I use the Weather Channel internet site down here, they're as good as any and I like their radar.  http://www.weather.com/weather/local/35096...archbox_localwx"
263972,Sinker,2008-11-02 13:07:00,8692,"I use the same as Terry. I find the weather network is usually ok, but accuweather long range is much closer........but still never right!!  When I start looking for ice I""ll use the MODIS sattellite imagery.  Sinker"
263975,irishfield,2008-11-02 13:13:00,26272,LOL Andy ! I look outside and see what it's doing... then plan accordingly. Terry should be in the laneway any minute !
264008,POLLIWOGG,2008-11-02 17:36:00,835,Get yourself into a Canadian Power and sail Squadrons weather coarse and do like Irishfield and predict the weather yourself. Its the best $ you'll ever spend because you'll use it every day.
264058,Terry,2008-11-02 23:07:00,14456,LOL    I like watching the ice forming on lake simcoe every year on the MODIS sattellite
