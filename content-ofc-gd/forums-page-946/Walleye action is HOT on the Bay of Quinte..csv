264044,DT10Sam,2008-11-02 22:00:00,480,"Hi Everyone,  I had a couple of friends up from the Brantford area fishing the last 3-4 days and they boated 22 walleyes from a range of 9-12 lbs. All of their walleyes were caught east of the Glenora Ferry. I will have to wait until they get home ask them to email me their pics and I will post them.  I should be out later this week and next and I will be pleased to post my success.  The weather seems to be holding quite well for fishing and the pits for the Big Bucks that seem to still be nocturnal everything in pre-rut stage, it won't be long for them fellas to make the dinner table as well.  For those of you coming up to fish feel free to drop me an email and I will be pleased to let you know where to head to and what we are getting our walleyes on.  Best regards, Sam"
