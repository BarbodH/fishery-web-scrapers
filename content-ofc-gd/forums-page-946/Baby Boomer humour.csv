Since the last time I saw them was when I was helping another aunt move I was going to have to say yes. However I wasn't too worried because at that time they said the next move they would do would be to a retirement villa. So I said yes and right after I did he said you won't need to bring the work van because there is no driving. While still sharp of mind I knew it wasn't going to be fun after all. They were moving UPSTAIRS in the house they rent, (the landlord promised to put in a stair lift because my aunt has had two knee replacements oh joy). I lost count after the 70th trip down the 30ft driveway and up 18 stairs. The funny thing was when we got finished my aunt goes I would like to thank you kids for helping us out.... One nephew was 53, the other 49 and I am 45 it is all relative I guess."
