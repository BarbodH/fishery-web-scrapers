263478,Bernie,2008-10-31 02:04:00,3190,Good luck in your hunt Leechman. I won't necessarily be looking for the big one though. The smaller ones are much better table fare.
263482,Leecher,2008-10-31 02:20:00,7832, That is true Bernie.... between 2 1/2 and 3 1/2 years old are the best table fare. Got the doe tag this year and hoping to get a nice one Thanks and good luck to you
