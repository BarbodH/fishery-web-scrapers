263860,boddah,2008-11-01 21:35:00,61,"ok i just finished with the boat did some searches on how to.... now, i stabilized the gas, fogged the cylinders and then noticed black oil leaking from the prop.   so i checked the lower unit oil and it is fine not black or milky.  allthough when i open the drain plug expecting the oil to shoot out  it didnt, so i remove it totaly and it slowly leaked out?  is this because the oil is very thick or is the level very low?"
263862,Dutch,2008-11-01 21:48:00,831,"There should be a screw at the top of the unit to take out as well.  It allows the oil to go out faster.  It is leaking out slowly because there is a vaccuum present.  When filling the unit back up with oil, fill it from the bottom to push all air out the top hole.  If there's air left in there, it can cause condensation to build up and parts ""could"" rust."
263870,forrest,2008-11-01 22:39:00,1032,"if you are leaking oil from the prop that is not normal (as far as i know).  Check for fishing line, your seals probably need replaced.  forrest"
263873,irishfield,2008-11-01 22:44:00,26272,"You sure it's black oil ""leaking"" or just 2 stroke exhaust ""staining""?  As Dutch said... the oil won't come out the lower plug if you don't remove the top vent plug. If you're gonna check it... drain it.. and refill with new oil."
263881,boddah,2008-11-01 23:17:00,61,if the oil leaking from the prop is black and the lower gear oil is clean then it must be something else right? they would be the same oil? how much exaust staining could there be?
263897,Sinker,2008-11-02 00:19:00,8692,"Its common to get some left over unburnt oil coming out the exaust port at your prop.  As long as its not constantly leaking out, you should be fine.  Sinker"
