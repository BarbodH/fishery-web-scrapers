We are going to be in the area around disneyland, and I was wondering if anyone has been to that area and could suggest a guide or a website to look at to give us an idea of the cost and availability of this type of service.  We won't be taking any tackle so we would require the guide service to provide the equipment.  Any help would be appreciated."

Not difficult to pick up 20 bass in a 2 hour session. If you want the 'real deal', hook up with Roland Martin's marina and the guide service they provide. I know a few people who have tried the Martin's operation and have none but good things to tell of. At that time of year they are usually big on fishing with shad on circle hooks"
