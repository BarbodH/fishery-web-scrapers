263432,Marko,2008-10-31 00:24:00,854,"Hey guys. I am heading up north to Owen Sound tomorrow morning in the search of my first rainbow. I heard good things about it on the weekend, even tho i fished in Owen sound before it was for salmon and never for trout. Question is if anyone knows if the river is blown. Talked to the guy in a fishing store and he said the river might be high but he was not sure. Thanks for any info"
263439,Bernie,2008-10-31 00:37:00,3190,I have discovered through the fishing tourney that Marko is a true dedicated fisherman. Attaboy Marko! Go get em' Good luck
263448,Marko,2008-10-31 01:13:00,854,"Ty for the kind words Bernie. Big trout has eluded me last year, trying to change that this year. Maybe I`ll get lucky and catch a musky instead seeing how we need one for the tourney"
263467,BillM,2008-10-31 01:51:00,17367,"I'll be on the Saugeen tomorrow in Southampton.  Water is supposed to be a bit high, but clarity shouldn't be a problem (Atleast from what a few locals have told me)"
263490,Marko,2008-10-31 02:52:00,854,"Good luck tomorrow Bill, hope you catch a big one. Hopefully water wont be too bad."
263682,Cookslav,2008-10-31 23:18:00,1457,"It was slow 2 weeks ago on the Sauble, and the gents I chatted up said the same abut the Saugeen...hope its turned around. Slow start to the run, but the best it yet to come right? ""crosses fingers"""
263684,Marko,2008-10-31 23:23:00,854,"Came back while ago, water was still fairly high. Hooked into one rainbow in couple of hours i stayed and it broke off. I was surprised by lack of fish swimming around. Saw one half dead salmon and couple of other dead ones and that was it"
