263377,babaganoush,2008-10-30 20:55:00,105,do i still need to buy a trail pass if all i intend to do is use the sled for ice fishing???
263381,BUSTER,2008-10-30 21:08:00,1336,"you do if you go on a groom trail,   no for the lakes"
263384,tjsa,2008-10-30 21:17:00,1578,"You shouldn't as far as I am concerned. Lots of the trails we are using,crossing are on traditional access roads/trails that we used to use to get to lakes to fish well before the trail system came into place, regardless of how the trail conditions were. The fact that sections of them may be groomed because of great snow conditions, well, excellent. Just don't try to fool them by having a couple spools of ice fishing line in your backpack without any lures, augers, jigging rods, tip-ups, etc.  And, do the proper speed limit also. The trails do have speed limits. Honor them.  It's never been an issue up here in Northwestern Ontario anyway that I know of."
263386,misfish,2008-10-30 21:20:00,29133,"Im not 100% on this,maybe RobC can clear it,as I believe we had this convo before, if you are heading to a lake and have your fishing gear with you,you can use a trail if it is the only safe way to get there. You are not really using the trail sorta speak,just using an access point to get to your distination."
263389,irishfield,2008-10-30 21:24:00,26272,That is correct... you can ride the entire Temagami area with an ice auger on the back and a fishing rod.
263391,misfish,2008-10-30 21:29:00,29133, I got one right.YES.LOL
263393,irishfield,2008-10-30 21:30:00,26272,"Just be sure you can name the lake you are ""heading for""!"
263397,misfish,2008-10-30 21:34:00,29133," So what yer saying is,if Im in the Temagami area ,and say Im heading for Big Bay Point,it may not work?"
263398,babaganoush,2008-10-30 21:37:00,105,"thanks for the replies, i was hoping i did not need to buy one now i have more $$$$ to gas up my sled"
263409,ecmilley,2008-10-30 22:26:00,2163,"If it is a ofsc trail that goes through private property you need a permit regardless, if it's on a public trail then no pass required to go fishing/hunting"
263468,ctdd2006,2008-10-31 01:51:00,531,It was explained to me by a S.T.O.P officer (OPP) on the trail that I'm only entitled to use the ofsc trails to go fishing provided I'm taking the shortest/safest route.  i.e. I can't leave my house (where the trail is easily accessed) and ride the 20miles to my fave lake when I could have trailered my sled to a nearer access point.  I was warned that if I wanted to continue using that route a pass was needed and the next time I'd be fined.
