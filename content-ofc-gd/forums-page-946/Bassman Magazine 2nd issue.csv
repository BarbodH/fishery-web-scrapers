263037,marcers75,2008-10-29 16:23:00,36,"I was just wondering if anyone received thier 2nd issue of Bassman magazine? if so, what did you think of it?"
263039,BillM,2008-10-29 16:32:00,17367,"I got it, wasn't expecting it, haven't looked at it yet."
263048,Roy,2008-10-29 16:56:00,13728,Got mine. Read it from cover to cover and I enjoyed it.
263073,GBW,2008-10-29 18:42:00,8460,"got mine too, it was good.  And our very own JohnF had his comment printed..."
263085,fishindevil,2008-10-29 19:10:00,6254,"Yes i got mine as well,and so far i think its a pretty good magazine !!!! good read about the gobies..."
263140,jjcanoe,2008-10-29 21:55:00,744,Got it. Read it from front to back and I enjoyed it. Still a little light on content but for a brand new mag you don't expect it to be Field & Stream! Keep 'em coming I'll be renewing again.  jjcanoe
263145,danbouck,2008-10-29 21:59:00,4380,Got mine and enjoyed it!
263148,Rich Clemens,2008-10-29 22:03:00,3131,"Got one down here in the states as well.   Haven't gone through it much yet.  I thjought that, when I signed up, I would only get the premire issue.  Quite a surprise, and a nice one at that, to receive the second issue."
263155,JohnF,2008-10-29 22:29:00,3494, I did? Sheesh. I read the mag and didn't even see it. Now I gotta go back and look.  JF
263156,pidge,2008-10-29 22:44:00,438,"got mine, but heres the strange question, where did we sign up for this magazine. I dont rember sigining up for a magazine sub."
263218,Rattletrap2,2008-10-30 01:10:00,1652,"I got mine and enjoyed it even more than the premier issue......even though the bikinis were missing! We signed up for a contest, but they decided to send these sample issues out to a large group of people from this site instead of just the winners. So far, so good."
263221,bassboy,2008-10-30 01:14:00,161,I was surprised to get one too......havent read it yet though....my wife wont let me have it  Bill
263251,GBW,2008-10-30 03:25:00,8460, Same here.   Yeah John you are there in the first few pages...  maybe that's why the one woman has less items on then normal...
263361,bbog,2008-10-30 19:28:00,665,Got mine a week or so ago and am slowly getting through it. Enjoying it alot since targeting Bass more this year.  My OOoDs magazine arrived this week but I have yet to unwrap it.
263372,legacey,2008-10-30 20:08:00,127,"Got mine and read it cover to cover as well.  Bass Man emailed me to find out what I thought of it. I gave it a 2 thumbs up!  My only comment, that was somewhat negative, was the timing.  The article about the family (sorry, can't think of her name but the pregnant one) didn't indicate how she / they did for the 2008 season. This article was written, my reading and comprehension anyways, in 2007 and it was the 2008 season she'd have been back. Also, it listed only 2 of the Renegades, if I remember correctly, and the season was over when it arrived so the end results were not there.  I know it's brand new and they're still working out the bugs and actively doing well with wanting reviews.  I know for sure I'm going to continue my subscription and for my fathers and buddy too. I have a hat too that I wear with pride!  ...more bikinis though!  Cheers"
263759,singingdog,2008-11-01 10:25:00,1047,"I'm not big on tournaments, so I find it pretty light on content outside of the tourney results. I wouldn't subscribe."
263767,rob v,2008-11-01 11:57:00,535,"I got mine too, and I enjoyed reading it.   the price was right also !  Like others have said though, I'm not much into tournament bass fishing.  Having said that the first edition with the fairer sex featured and a bit of eye candy caught my attention !"
263770,lew,2008-11-01 12:04:00,12767,"I have an OFC sticker in the back window of my truck, and about a month ago I was stopped for a red light in downtown Toronto. A car stopped behind me, the driver got out and came up to me and said ""here ya go, I saw your window sticker"" and handed me a business card that read Bassman Magazine.  He hopped back in his car, the light turned green, and we both went on our way.  I don't know if he's a member of this board or not and had never heard of the mag before then, but whoever it was, I hope his magazine is a success.  I never fish for bass so will not subscribe to it, but I liked his style and wish him luck"
263780,JohnF,2008-11-01 13:10:00,3494," I found it. I remember thinking thoughts like that but hadn't remembered sending it to the mag. Mebbe that has something to do with being on the downhill side of 60.  As for the mag, I like the content. As a recent returnee to the wonderful world of bassfishery after a 50 year hiatus, I really did enjoy the articles that dealt with bass tools & tactics at a level even I can understand. I suppose for the same reason you grizzled veterans of the bass wars might find it a little rudimentary. It's tough to satisfy everyone. What I really wanna find out is where all those pretty girls in the bikinis do their bassin'. All my fishing companions seem to be unshaven potbellies suffering from terminal flatulence.  JF"
