263275,gone_fishin,2008-10-30 05:25:00,481,Suspending Jerk Baits would be right near the top of my list!
263280,bigugli,2008-10-30 09:02:00,6138,"The 300 and 300A were the most durable and reliable reels ever made. I got a 300A for my 13th. birthday and only finally retired it 30 years later when the bail spring went. Easy to look after, just a little grease once a year. Everybody tried to copy it , and Shakespeare had one or two reels that came close in quality, but not as  durable."

263285,MCTFisher9120,2008-10-30 10:55:00,3761,what about spinnerbaits
263293,lew,2008-10-30 11:44:00,12767,"I've been fishing about 55 years so I've seen alot of new stuff come & go, but I think GPS units have had a big impact and the way we fish, specially on new lakes where we aren't familiar with the structure.  Kinda nice to be able to look at the screen and basically see the whole lake bottom while were cruising around and pick out the good looking areas, then just drive straight to the humps or drop-offs or whatever else were searching for.  Also saves alot of props & lower units too $$$$$$$$"
263318,Musky or Specks,2008-10-30 14:09:00,2710,"Flourocarbon fishing line is a huge inovation. It went from no one using it to cant do without it. Braided polymer line, and GPS are the big three I can think of that came into being since the nineties. Oh lso chemically sharpened hooks."

263321,anders,2008-10-30 14:21:00,1168,Beer!
263326,WeedLine,2008-10-30 14:56:00,322,Polarized sunglasses are one the most important tools of my fishing gear.
263754,Dabluz,2008-11-01 06:45:00,701,"How about the Beetle Spin.  Before the Beetle spin, plastic baits, jigs and spinner baits were unheard of.  Then....maybe....the Daredevil spoon.  Most certainly the muddler minnow."
263764,jace,2008-11-01 11:38:00,472,"I have to agree with other comments on this list being a little weird.   I'd like to know when this poll was taken and the kind of fishermen that  make up the membership in their legacy program.   The question sounds like it's asking for products with the most impact which to me means revolutionary impact. That list is mostly simple evolutionary changes in my opinion.    For example, spring loading the bobber attachment doesn't really change anything about a bobber or how it's fished.  If that list was made this year, I would scratch 1/2 the items given and add downrigger/divers, graphite rods, gps, gel spun line, polarized lenses, circle hooks, and maybe vhf radio and cell phones if you're into big water or coastal fishing.   I don't know who came up with some of these so i didn't name the specific products that first brought the things to market."
263775,mbac31,2008-11-01 12:36:00,904,"Hey guys what about the old form of Radio, the CB Radio or the VHF. I'm sure safety comes in effect on this list along with Safety Flares."
263792,OhioFisherman,2008-11-01 14:57:00,6623,"Caught a lot of fish before I got an electric motor, graphite rod, ugly stick, depth finder, Rapala, zebco reel.  1. Mitchell 300 reel 2. plastic worm 3. for me Stren line, original"
263793,Grimace,2008-11-01 15:08:00,2020,"Graphite, Wire leaders, swivels, The float."
263795,irishfield,2008-11-01 15:09:00,26272,For me it was the dew worm! Was a big step up from the Mock Chicken / Bologna / salami cut offs that my father gave me from the meat room for sure. Ever tried keeping wet slimmy Mock Chicken on a hook..........
263804,Dabluz,2008-11-01 16:25:00,701,"I find the list in the first message to be great except for the last 2 items....the graphite rod and the Ugly Stick.  I just can't see where they revolutionized fishing all that much.  I've used steel rods, glass rods, fiberglass rods, graphite rods, boron rods and cane rods.  They were all great for their time but they didn't change fishing.  I remember when I used braided nylon...you know that black line and I think I even used a silk line on a level wind reel and I remember my dad drying out his silk line in the house by looping the line over the door knobs.  Mono was a big breakthrough and the new braided lines have not replaced mono."
263847,Clampet,2008-11-01 20:21:00,1947,"I did not take the time to read thru this thread, so I do not know if lead head jig has been mentioned.  I think it revolutionized the presentation aspect of fishing."

263856,Dabluz,2008-11-01 21:26:00,701," No...the lead jig was not specifically signaled out except for me saying that the Beetle Spin should be on the list.  This lure was a jig, had a plastic bait and a spinner."
263859,Clampet,2008-11-01 21:31:00,1947,"Yeah, I know the Beetle Spin, I used to go to school with his younger brother.  They are great lures actually, combining the flash of the blade with the depth control of the weighted head, depending on how fast you retrieve it."
263874,Rich,2008-11-01 22:44:00,3927,"I'd say the flying hellgramite - the world's first mass produced artificial fishing lure - would be a big one.  Balsa floats, Mepps spinners, electric trolling motors, LCD sonar, GPS, underwater cameras..  sheesh.. fish don't stand a chance these days."
262849,kickingfrog,2008-10-29 00:24:00,8333,"The American Sportfishing Association (ASA) polled their Legacy program members to name the products that had the most impact on the sport in the past 75 years.

262867,GbayGiant,2008-10-29 00:50:00,1780,"Wow, thats old school, a more recent list would be something like this.  The trolling motor, yes for sure. Fish finder, for sure GPS Senko Braided line lindy rigs Gulp  Theres a few anyway."
262868,johnnyb,2008-10-29 00:51:00,3413,what about scent/salt impregnated soft baits?
262876,Wild,2008-10-29 01:09:00,704,Someone forgot he bass boat
262885,pike slayer,2008-10-29 01:29:00,1177,i gotta say rapala xrap 2005 and also fish finders and gps'
262889,Dutch,2008-10-29 01:34:00,831,Twister tail grubs should be there.  I guess that may be covered by the plastic worm as all soft plastic may have come after the initial worm.  I would think flashers/sonar/structure finders should be there as well.
262920,Rizzo,2008-10-29 02:32:00,4754,how about downriggers (this coming from a guy who has never used one) and underwater cameras
262922,Dondorfish,2008-10-29 02:38:00,1000, Might as well add planer boards and inline boards to the list as well  Don

Throw in todays advanced sonar and the fish don't have a chance.  I remember back in grade school in the early 60's they taught us that the oceans resources were so vast that they would never be depleted... little did they know..."
262967,BITEME,2008-10-29 11:54:00,1969,1 word RAPALA

263098,Beans,2008-10-29 19:53:00,3339,I would have put the Mitchel 300 Spinning reel at the top of the list...  It sure opened up a whole new world of fishing for me...
263229,fishindevil,2008-10-30 01:26:00,6254,"I think:  -digital sonar  -downriggers  -rapal lures [they have all the world records for world records,for i think 181 fish species world wide !!!]"
263232,kemper,2008-10-30 01:36:00,2232,"  this is true...but I wonder if they are all true.  example, if I ever catch a world record I would consider saying that I ""caught her on a rapala"" . It equals publicity, and in all likelyhood a cheque or two"
