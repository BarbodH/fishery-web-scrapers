Found a  spot where a small feeder empties into the river and hoped for crappie, perch or smallies.  The action was pretty heavy for most of the afternoon, but not with the target species. There were a few nice perch, a couple of dink bass, and hundreds upon hundreds of these:   There were probably 3 year classes schooled up on the one spot. A half hour of one size followed by a half hour of another size, etc.... Gillies from 6""= 9 1/2"". Kept a few fish ranging from 8-10"" for a feed or two. Despite the weather being a bit off, not a bad afternoon."
