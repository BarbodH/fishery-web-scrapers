263164,Time2Fish,2008-10-29 23:35:00,9,"Hey guys,  Gonna take the day off and head for quinte on Monday.  Usually when we have come up, we turn it into 2 or 3 days and have stayed at blakewood on the south shore of Hay Bay.  Coming from the west, not exactly sure where to launch the boat.  I am sure if I exit on #49 head south to Picton I will find one in town.  DOes anyone have some info they could share...location, cost, good ramp etc?  Planning on trolling or jigging around Thompsons and Shermans point as well as near the ferry.  Thanks in advance."
263176,Mike the Pike,2008-10-29 23:56:00,3421,Your best bet would be Picton Harbour launch get ther early as parking can be scarce by far the nicest launch.  I think there is another launch down the road from picton Harbour called Mcfarlens its free but you will need a 4 X 4 .  There is another launch take the ferry across from the Picton side and launch once you exit the ferry.  Have a safe trip.  MTP
263186,Grimace,2008-10-30 00:06:00,2020,Picton Harbour is a nice launch.    Good access point for your areas of choice.   Like Mike the Pike said parking can get scarce if you get there too late
263207,Time2Fish,2008-10-30 00:31:00,9,"thanks guys, parking could be dicey as I am leaving from Cambridge in the morning...  Should be as busy on a monday should it.  Also, looks like the bite is starting up a little.  I was there 2 weeks ago...marked all kinds, didn't catch much. any input?"
263307,Headhunter,2008-10-30 12:40:00,5703,"Re marking fish and not catchin... do you know what your marking? Are you sure your marking eyes? If yer marking and not catchin, your either not deep enough, or too deep. HH"
263308,Fang,2008-10-30 13:02:00,1330,"If you've stayed on Hay Bay and know the area you could easily drive down to north shore of Glenora Ferry. Check out a map and see the ferry route from Picton across the north shore. Nice sheltered launch, restrooms and free."
263317,Fish Farmer,2008-10-30 14:03:00,2234,"A good tip, if your going Nov.,Dec. carry a bag of salt for the ramps.  Watch your tail lights,transducer,speedo,prop backing in if theres ice at the ramps. Tilt your motor back down after you come out of the water to drain, pull drain plug. Think about the freezing damage. Nice thing about all the ramps, there free. Would be nice if other municipalities would take the hint."
263332,POLLIWOGG,2008-10-30 15:57:00,835,I approached a councilor trying to get you guys a grate or something so you don't have to risk getting caught salting the ramp and his first reaction was lets close the ramp. Maybe I'll have to try again and see if we can get you something built.

263850,Time2Fish,2008-11-01 20:32:00,9,"Thanks again all.  The advice should get the boat in the water one way or another.  Looks like rain for monday, oh well, that is why I bought the topset...  Thanks guys,  keep your lines wet!"
