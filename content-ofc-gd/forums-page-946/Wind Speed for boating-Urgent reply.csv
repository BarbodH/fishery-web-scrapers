264012,idesign,2008-11-02 18:35:00,149,"Guys can any1 tell me the safe wind speed for boating.Right now on weather.ca it is showing ""Wind E 25km/h"".so is this safe speed.outside looks sunny.i wana go with friends for boat riding for last time before i winterize.so can some1 reply fast.thx"
264013,SlowPoke,2008-11-02 18:44:00,2984, Where? What kind of boat?
264014,timmeh,2008-11-02 19:02:00,609,"There a lot of things to think about. What kind/ how big of boat. And mostly what direction is the wind coming from? If it's blowing across the lake that will create bigger waves. What lake are you on?  There really is no definitive answer to this question. You just need to use common sense!!  If you're new to boating play it safe especially if you're on the great lakes, or another large lake!"
264016,idesign,2008-11-02 19:12:00,149,Lake Ontario.. Bluffer's Park Boat is 17.5 foot bow rider.
264022,SlowPoke,2008-11-02 19:36:00,2984,Forecast is calling for 20 knots E by 5PM. I wouldn't go out for the sake of a boat ride.
264023,Jer,2008-11-02 19:38:00,1426,"I don't like 25 kph winds on an inland lake, never mind Lake Ontario. East wind on Bluffers park could be nasty."
264028,Greencoachdog,2008-11-02 20:01:00,8163,15-25 mph winds on big open water like that would prolly be more like a roller coaster ride than a boat ride.
264029,idesign,2008-11-02 20:08:00,149,"thx guys for replying.as per ur suggestions i am not going.here winds is getting nasty by my house so i am assuming lake would be more worst.thx  BTW,what if we are close to shore.is it still dangerous.just asking for future reference.let me know."

264040,tinbanger,2008-11-02 21:43:00,1028,we were out today from Orillia towards Stawberry - definate roller coaster but no probelm as we are familar with the boat and what it can take.  Oh yeah - no fish  TB
264047,irishfield,2008-11-02 22:21:00,26272,All depends on the boat and crew capabilites.  Terry and I enjoyed a dry day... in 5 footers !
264048,Pigeontroller,2008-11-02 22:32:00,2793,"Asking this question is an indication that you shouldn't be out boating on the Great Lakes, stick to smaller inland waters till you become more experienced!"
264050,SBCregal,2008-11-02 22:43:00,688,im with pigeontroller.  i seem to remember posts from earlier this year and the purchase of the boat you're talking about seems you're quite the beginner (dont take it the wrong way...i am too).  lake o is a big body of water... even on a good day it can turn on you REAL quickly.  a few fish isnt worth risking safety
264066,JFR,2008-11-02 23:25:00,498,"  New Angler.  Here is a chart for wind speeds. Called the Beaufort Wind Scale. This gives you the speed, in Knots and Kms, also a desrciption of what the seas would look like.  http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/marine/glos...mp;siteID=07601  You should also bookmark the weather page that will have a link to it.

264068,Pigeontroller,2008-11-02 23:28:00,2793,I've said it before but there's a big difference between inland boating and Great Lakes boating. The Great Lakes aren't to be underestimated!!! They will kick your    if you don't respect them!!!
264070,Greencoachdog,2008-11-02 23:30:00,8163," If you're closer to shore, it only means you won't have to swim as far to reach it!  Being in a small boat in rough water isn't usually that much fun, and the fishin' isn't usually very good either.  Use the windy days to work on/clean your boat and to clean and lubricate your reels, sharpen your hooks, check your line, organize your tackle box..."
264093,Beans,2008-11-02 23:57:00,3339,CTV News @ 06:00-Toronto had a clip of some guys surfing off Bluffer's Park...huge waves !!!  You sure didn't want to be out in that water...
264191,John Bacon,2008-11-03 03:43:00,3277, Not at this time of the year.  That water is cold!  And there aren't many other boats out there to come to aid at this time of year.  I would suggest getting some experience in the summer months before heading out in November.
264206,POLLIWOGG,2008-11-03 07:01:00,835,"Experience in that area is the only way to answer that as we would need to know wind speed and fetch (distance the wind travels across the water)and local depth.  Wind at that speed across the water would produce lots of chop and white caps pretty much everywhere and set up into big rollers.  Close to shore is fine for an off shore wind but if the wind blows wave action toward shore its the last place you want to be. Waves are wheels of water and you only see the tops, as the waves get crowded in the shallow water and by returning surge they rise up higher and break more. And when the %$$ hits the fan you want to be out where you have more time to react.  A bow rider in big rollers is also a big dipper and can scoop up a lot of water.  Staying home was a good idea. Boating in heavy weather is something you want to practice your way into rather than a crash course."
