263053,POLLIWOGG,2008-10-29 17:09:00,835,"According to the bill windshield mounted GPS is still legal, according to the HTA they never were legal.  The interesting thing is that there is a cell phone issue when less than 8% of the public have them, if you were to imagine what it would be like with 50 % of the public using them maybe its a good idea to address the problem sooner than later.  When we use the roads we put a lot of trust into a lot of people we don't know and it would be nice to know they're looking out for us."
263062,wgk36,2008-10-29 18:05:00,69,"Alot has already been said, but I'll through my hat in anyway....I think that cell phones are a distraction and it's a great idea to ban them.  It's been that way in Quebec since the spring.  Unfortunately, enforcement is next to impossible.  People continue to use them, and continue to drive poorly as a result.  People have to accept the idea of not using them, and apply it on their own.  Simply making a law won't do it.  Much education is needed, and we are probably a generation away before it becomes widely accepted.  There will always be an initial backlash because people think that there rights are being taken away.  It was that way with seat belts, helmets on bicycles and helmets in hockey."

LOL sorry couldnt pass it up and I am just a redneck in a pick up so don't pay me no mind.  I would add on the serious side though that pulling over to use the cell phone is illegal here in the States because of the amount of people that pulled over into the emergency lanes to talk were getting rear ended by people avoiding/ using the emergency lanes. I use blue tooth on the phone and can honestly say that I am a safer driver listening to Tom Tom give directions from house to house than checking a map every few turns.   Art

I don't think there is a single person here who hasn't had a near miss or observed one involving some one talking on a cell phone while driving. I agree that we can't legislate away idiot behavior on our roads that is always going to be there. I saw a guy a couple of weeks ago on the QEW at 120 kph in a construction zone with his left signal on constantly. He was using a Bluetooth and was gesturing frantically with both hands while talking. He is obviously an idiot and no amount of laws will change that. However I think that the legislation will curb the behavior of enough people to make a difference and make my morning commute a little safer and more efficient."

262614,bigugli,2008-10-28 15:30:00,6138,"Odds are a ban on cell use will be difficult to physically enforce. Same with drinking or seatbelts. You will eventually get 80-85% voluntary compliance. Your vehicle insurance is only valid while you are complying with the law. So if you have an accident while breaking the law, your insurance is null and void. Its a standard clause in almost every policy. We comply because we have something at stake to lose. We have families, homes and careers. Things that matter personally. How much would you lose if your insurance did not cover an accident? That portion that doesn't comply do not understand personal consequence. Young, single, no ties, money to burn, egocentric, don't care. Whatever the excuse you pick, that is the portion the police have to target, and most will slip through the net. No different than DUI's, or highway racers doing 180+, or the thousands that drive our highways without insurance ."

A friend of mine got charged with careless because he rolled his cruiser on his way to a serious call. which means he gets a $325 ticket and loses the equivalent of 2 weeks pay.

Government should also take away all the controls on the steering column too, along with the all radios especially the ones with text information, cd, mp3 players etc.  People misuse these devices by not paying attention to the road and spending too much time playing with their toys.  What makes the premier think that making it illegal will improve their driving.  That seems to be the problem with our governments. Most of the time, instead of addressing the issues they just lump everything in together and ban it all.  The people who normally follow the law will try to follow the law and the ones who are causing the problem will continue doing what they were doing before the ban.  I am sure all the lobbyists and politicians will feel much better for doing what they do the best>>>>>> Going over board creating new laws that won't correct the problem and only cause aggravation for the law abiding public.

He was still talking to her when the train nailed them and killed them both.  The reason I want the phones banned is because I've been nearly hit four time by drivers talking on a hand held phone and the worst thing was is that all were either in a Wal-Mart or mall parking lot.

Figures they may ban GPS units just as I'm about to buy my 1st one, but I spose on the bright side, I may have just saved $300  Cell phones can definetely be a dangerous thing when someone is trying to dial a number while weaving in and outta traffic at 80 MPH, but I always thought a GPS could be a helpful tool when used properly and is certainly much safer than trying to read a map while it's draped over the steering wheel the way some do it  Oh well, I spose the $300 will add a couple nice baits to the tackle box....."

Unless there is a fully automatic GPS system then you are taking your hand off the wheel and your eyes off the road which is distracting the driver even if it's one second.

261780,Guest lundboy,2008-10-26 14:10:00,0,"Problem is, how does one ""ban"" something like this?  Especially how is it policed?  How will the policing be paid for, and at what detriment to something else?  School programs, or garbage pickup or OHIP, perhaps higher taxes? Hire more cops beef up the police/nanny state?  Slippery slope for sure.  Drunk driving has been banned for decades yet every week we hear of another drinking related accident.  Only way to effectively police DUI is with spot checks.  Cell phones? Some will follow the rules very few probably most, will not.  Some will be spotted by a passing cruiser, most will not.  I haven't yet heard of any deaths attributed to cell phone use on Ontario roads.  Could be that I just haven't been paying attention."

Some people do not own half an ounce of common sense."
261784,Mattones,2008-10-26 14:17:00,587,Sadly the ban wont stop people from talking on their cell phones. Teenagers will continue to do it. they might as well stop people from having an open drink in their cars such as in Europe.  I would like to see it happen but GPS? i use one and have never had a problem with it. All you do is listen its places right below the rear view mirror so as your checking behing you you can look on it aswell.  Oh well laws change in time just gotta bite the bullet. such as the pitbull law.

I think an all out ban is going too far.
