263841,irishfield,2008-11-01 20:06:00,26272,That first shot is a real brute for sure!!!  Great stuff!

263848,shayne,2008-11-01 20:22:00,21,YES CLAMP IT!!!  YOU ARE CORRECT!!! Shayne

263915,Rich,2008-11-02 01:22:00,3927,Beauty! Hope I get to hit the lower Grand soon. About the only place I actually enjoy steelheading.
263929,silvio,2008-11-02 02:24:00,433,Hey shayne would you know the average amount of steelhead the head up the grand? P.S beauty fish now I am going to have to try it one day.
263932,Paully,2008-11-02 03:03:00,712,Good size fish! way to go ...
263950,sharper,2008-11-02 05:05:00,279,"Those are some nice looking steel, good job. I gotta try the grand for some steel sometime as well."
263960,Rich,2008-11-02 11:10:00,3927,"silvio, it's nothing compared to the eastern Lake O tribs. You can have some decent days though."
263995,douG,2008-11-02 15:20:00,2693,Those are huge.
264139,KelfuN,2008-11-03 01:29:00,246,"the first picture is amazing, the steel is so round!  so i guess dew worms do work on trout   i gotta give that a try next time."
