A bit tricky to figure out, but after a few mins it's not to hard.  Raven IM6 13'6 3 piece along with a Streamside FL425 centerpin.       I think I am going to try my luck on the Credit or Bronte one day after work for a few hours, I am sure I won't catch anything, but it's better then sitting in traffic on the 400"

264365,silvio,2008-11-03 20:36:00,433,Bill I got both the rod and reel my rod is customized not to fond of its action. the reel does the job tolerance isn't the best I just use it for salmon. I use a spahr and fenwick for bows but getting more gear this week. None the less its an amazing setup. May the money spending begin.
