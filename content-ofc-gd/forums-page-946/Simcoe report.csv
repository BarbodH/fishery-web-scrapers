264085,Terry,2008-11-02 23:46:00,14456,skunk...don't like to use that word...how about a nice day on the water uninterrupted by slimy fish
264088,irishfield,2008-11-02 23:49:00,26272,Yah Terry... you'd hope there was enough fish smell in the boat so he couldn't smell the skunk. I know in mine all I can smell is that Shithead you slimmed the boat with last year on BOQ
264089,tinbanger,2008-11-02 23:50:00,1028,"Terry ,for sure last sk--k cracked my trailer fender on the way to GBAY couple week back, come to think of it , no fish in the boat since. Coincidence ?  TB"
