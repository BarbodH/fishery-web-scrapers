764213,Joey,2013-01-31 23:42:00,9122,"We need four more people to join to even up the teams.  It won't be fair to all teams if we put the four we have ready to join  on a team.  This will leave four teams with one less team member, and I'm sure that will not go over well  So please, anyone remotely interested in this fun tourney, please sign up.  First 4 are in!!  Thanks a bunch!!!!  Joey"
