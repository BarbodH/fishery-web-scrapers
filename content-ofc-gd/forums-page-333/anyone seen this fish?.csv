762800,boddah,2013-01-26 21:03:00,61,"pulled this thru the ice today...has the body ,mouth of a rockbass but blue markings on the head like a bluegill...hybrid?? "
762801,davey buoy,2013-01-26 21:06:00,5505,"No idea,but looks cool!!. Looks a bit like a cichlid."
762802,Locnar,2013-01-26 21:11:00,645,"Woah, cooool! The head shape even looks more like a bluegill's as well. Did ya eat it?"
762803,misfish,2013-01-26 21:16:00,29133,Looks like embreeding. Rock and sun fish.
762804,DoubleDigits,2013-01-26 21:22:00,140,Green sunfish/pumpinseed hybrid?
762805,boddah,2013-01-26 21:22:00,61,can two types of fish breed??  i wanna see largemouth and pike...bigass mouth full of teeth
762807,lickmyarmpit,2013-01-26 21:36:00,359,Looks like what's called a warmouth sunfish.  My guess anyways. Tried to add a link but my computer skills are lacking....google it looks about right.
762812,outllaw,2013-01-26 22:13:00,1232,i would eat it. gotta be better then tilapia or basa lol.
762814,craigdritchie,2013-01-26 22:25:00,1586,"It's not entirely unusual for different kinds of sunfish to cross-breed. I would hazard a guess it might be a punkinseed-bluegill hybrid, but that's just a guess, nothing more. Cool looking fish in any case."
762820,Garfisher,2013-01-26 22:38:00,229,"I think it's a straight Green Sunfish. Green Sunfish do hybirdize with other sunfish readily (including Bluegill and Pumpkinseed), however I think this one isn't a hybrid because the mouth on it is huge, and if it were hybridized it would have a slightly smaller maw on it."
762822,Acountdeleted,2013-01-26 22:41:00,2562,I'd say green sunfish as well. Never seen one that big. Very cool.
762826,ehg,2013-01-26 22:50:00,2666,Ya it is a Warmouth. Guess you caught it around Rondeau Bay/Lake Erie. They are very uncommon and considered an endangered species in Ontario. Here is a link... http://www.rom.on.ca/ontario/risk.php?doc_type=fact&id=86
762827,trevy727,2013-01-26 22:52:00,351,Definately a cross with a rock bass. The mouth is all bass.
762828,boddah,2013-01-26 23:07:00,61,i am not near erie...in king township...caught it in a pond that i couldnt fish in summer cause of bullrushes and swampy conditions
762829,boddah,2013-01-26 23:09:00,61,it has the mouth of a bass for sure and has sunfih markings....doesnt really look like a warmouth?
762830,davey buoy,2013-01-26 23:09:00,5505,"Just remembered 2 years or so ago picked up two dozen minnows.One minnow was different,up and down the side of the bag.Put it in one of my tanks,posted a picture here 6 mths later.Very aggressive,and most that replied  determined it was a green sunfish. Looks quite a bit like the OP's picture. Fairly common in some waters so I've heard."
762861,Bondy,2013-01-27 01:01:00,40,"I sent this thread to a well know fisheries biologist and here is what she wrote me back...  Hi Jon,It looks like the fish has 3 anal spines and it is definitely deep bodied, this gives us one of 6 species:Too bad there isn't a scale on the photo.WarmouthOrangespotted SunfishBluegillPumpkinseedGreen SunfishLongear SunfishFish has a large mouth, reaching to the eye & so the list is reduced to:WarmouthOrangespotted Sunfish (but it is not this species because the fish depicted does not have white edge around the ear flap& for many other reasons)Green SunfishThis gives us:Warmouth (has teeth on tongue): has 3 to 5 dark radiating lines going back from the eye (not seen in photo)Green Sunfish (no teeth on tongue)Solely on the photo, I think that the specimen is a Green Sunfish. It would be helpful to check out the teethJust my 2 cents."
762894,ehg,2013-01-27 03:50:00,2666,Nice uncommon catch anyways.
763224,Booger,2013-01-28 19:36:00,1,green sunfish.
763254,jimmer,2013-01-28 21:19:00,2730,"Cool, never seen one of those!"
763260,davey buoy,2013-01-28 21:41:00,5505,"Actually tried to pull rank on my Piranha's,very tough fish.In some southern states I've heard there a sport fish like bass."
763278,ehg,2013-01-28 23:00:00,2666,This map shows the very limited range of green sunfish in Ontario. No wonder they are not seen much. http://www.ontariofishes.ca/bigmap.php?FID=130&OMNR=312
763372,chris.brock,2013-01-29 08:40:00,4053,"I kept a small, green sunfish in an aquarium for a while, voracious little bugger, it would constantly harass the other fish, nipping their scales off  I came home one day to find that the green sunfish had jumped clear out of the tank and was dead on the floor  very cool, unique native fish"
763927,David Chong,2013-01-30 23:21:00,836,"Looks like a Green Sunfish to me! Nice specimen, I've never caught one personally myself!"
