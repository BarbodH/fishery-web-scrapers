764382,BillM,2013-02-01 18:41:00,17367,I think you can blame the captain on this one.   I've seen some vids where they are going like 10mph in reverse!  Crazy stuff!
764384,fishsevern,2013-02-01 19:15:00,112,What a great day to be a grouper in the area! I wonder how fish call dibs on newly sunken boats....
764390,jedimaster,2013-02-01 19:40:00,3472,So you are telling me that the guy holding onto the fishing rod was strong enough to also sink the boat? I smell something fishy...
764392,Roy,2013-02-01 19:50:00,13728,These things can go on forever. Go to Snopes.
764393,kickingfrog,2013-02-01 19:57:00,8333,"Careful now, that type of thinking would ruin Hollywood movies. You know the ones were the guy shoots a handgun with one hand and the bad guy goes flying back as the bullets hit him??? and Newton shrugs."
764397,NAW,2013-02-01 20:02:00,4022,I'm not believing that a fish could flip a bout of that size..
764398,kickingfrog,2013-02-01 20:04:00,8333,You sound like a Canadian.
764399,Leecher,2013-02-01 20:11:00,7832,Like Roy said... go to Snopes
764403,bigugli,2013-02-01 20:32:00,6138,Poor boat handling in a lively chop would be my bet.  Stuff a big wave in reverse and down you go
764439,Acountdeleted,2013-02-01 22:32:00,2562,MARLINS WIN!
764441,davey buoy,2013-02-01 22:37:00,5505,"His ass end looked a little low to start with. If he was using 80lb power pro maybe,just maybe it could pull the boat down  lol."
764475,fishindevil,2013-02-02 00:23:00,6254,Like billm says in his above post it has happened just like that before they jam it in reverse and chase them down !!!!  Captains error for sure !! Marlins have sunk many boats in the past it's easier to do than you think if you have ever driven a big boat like that before !!!! There is some wicked videos out there of boats holing up to massive marlins and they do go for hours like Roy says !!!! It looks totally legit to me ....still must have been quite the shock ....
764583,Dave Bailey,2013-02-02 14:58:00,1641,"Come on guys, if you're going to mention Snopes, at least post the link!  Here ya go: http://www.snopes.com/photos/hunting/marlinboat.asp"
764607,Joey,2013-02-02 15:52:00,9122,"Yup, Captain error on this one.  I love reading the comments, my favorite one is this one:  ""Somewhere on a ocean continental shelf hangs a stuffed human holding a beer can"""
