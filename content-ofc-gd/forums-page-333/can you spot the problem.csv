763407,mr blizzard,2013-01-29 14:42:00,1589,Judging by his coat colours he should be fishing for rainbows instead......and really......what's wrong with his reel???????????  . the floatation one is pretty good........
763409,TJQ,2013-01-29 14:47:00,7806,"LOL.. ""His rod is on backward...""  hahahaaha.."

763531,Guest ----,2013-01-29 21:00:00,0,wow...took the words right out of my mouth...
763535,ecmilley,2013-01-29 21:16:00,2163,i am guessing that that it's a defective reverse able handle
763563,Roy,2013-01-29 22:41:00,13728, I don't blame him. He's a lefty.
763950,esoxansteel,2013-01-31 00:30:00,1307,"Too much Appleton's Rum, its happened to me on occasion, in the same spot actually, usually with the late Don (Blackie) Blackmore and his pimped out psyedelic converted milk truck."
763954,chessy,2013-01-31 00:41:00,610,you were not involved in any trips into the heart of  town were you ..... lol    loyns said blackie was still alive ??
763958,NAW,2013-01-31 00:52:00,4022,That's what i was thinking at first too.  Must have a big live Perch on for bait.
764017,Ron,2013-01-31 09:00:00,1683,"  Blackie has long passed away. Lyons probably told you about the noodle rod of Blackies he has now brought out of the closet and uses on occasion at the river. Nooch even puts a Hardy fly reel on it like in the good old days.  Rumour has it, that Kovack is still on the green side though."
764050,chessy,2013-01-31 15:07:00,610,maybe that is where i messed up ..
764110,Harrison,2013-01-31 19:10:00,2202,"""Rods on backward"" bwaahhhh, thanks for that. lol...  I don't recognize him, but chances are he has his own show."
764228,moxie,2013-02-01 00:40:00,1566,"I finally figured it out, I think. Judging by his posture he should have taken that dump before he hit the ice."

763369,tonka-toy,2013-01-29 07:46:00,139,he seems to be walking on water? two lines in the river? awkward reel setup?
763377,Rich,2013-01-29 12:22:00,3927,"Well, I dont see any holes drilled.."
