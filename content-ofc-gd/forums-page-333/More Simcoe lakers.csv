Fish were there but not as active as hey were a week ago...Meegs did most of the damage today. Not sure it MNR still stocks white fish but this is second year in a row with very few whties been caught... Couple shots for your viewing pleasure:      Cheers, Ice Fisherman  "

764456,kickingfrog,2013-02-01 23:11:00,8333,Nice! What was the ice like?
764457,Cudz,2013-02-01 23:17:00,2652,"Hard and cold I bet.  Although hard is a relative term.  Sorry Rob, I know you would have replied the same way if I wrote that . lol"
764460,misfish,2013-02-01 23:28:00,29133,     Nice fish
764461,kickingfrog,2013-02-01 23:30:00,8333,Why would it be wet?
764471,icefisherman,2013-02-02 00:17:00,952,"Well is was actually wet in places with slush...had to check it and go slow to avoid slush beds. Some of them were with very thin ice and the spud went through on second hit. But in general where we were there was 4-5"" of ice...not much different from last weekend.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
