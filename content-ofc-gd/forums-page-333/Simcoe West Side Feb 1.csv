Checked as I traveled and all areas were about 5"" clear black Ice.  When I went out everthing was froze tight On the way back after some snow there was water and slush around some cracks.  I sure hope we do not get much snow If we do there will be a lot of Slush!!  The Meegs and the Williams put fish on the Ice.  These 2 came home for the table.  One of Each      See Ya on the Hard Stuff  Rick  "
