762675,limeyangler,2013-01-26 03:14:00,5204,"Hi all,   Went for some Lakers and whitefish today with the plan of heading 30kms into the bush afterwards to chase walleye too. The whitefish and trout cooperated and just as we were going to head out to the next lake so we could be there before dark......I lost a whitefish at the hole and before i could shout ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"" .......my buddy Cliff's reflexes kicked in and he had his arm down the hole up to his shoulder attempting to get it back......DOH! He spent the next 45 minutes drying out clothes in the shack....we never made it for walleye.   We did did get around 20 whities and 2 nice trout.  Cliffs trout was 32"" long with a 17'girth.......mine was also 17"" girth but shorter at 28"".  Cliff said that was the best fight he had ever had on the ice which made my day as this was the first time i had brought him to this lake....after many stories of how good the fishing can be.   Jigs and really tiny minnows got cliff all his fish including the big trout, and i got my whities on crappie tubes and the trout on a 6"" dace minnow on a circle hook.   All fish in the 36' - 40' FOW range.   Next weekend we intend to do the same but make time for walleye again...Cliff promises to stay dry till we achieve that....lol.                                           "
