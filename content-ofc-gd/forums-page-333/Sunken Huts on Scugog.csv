764486,GBW,2013-02-02 01:47:00,8460,Anyone going to scugog should be VERY careful right now as even seasoned locals have had hut problems this year.  That and the wide opem gap running from the tip of the island to the N shore too...

764512,SirCranksalot,2013-02-02 03:16:00,3291,  I'd be especially careful around Scugog. You never know what kind of fine the locals might hit you up with. I hear they are strapped for cash these days!
764541,steelie hunter,2013-02-02 07:00:00,55,I was on scugog tuesday aft/night for a few hours. Was out half a km or so in 9 feet of water and had a solid 12 inches of clear ice underneath me. Things must have changed quickly. Was a nice night to be out.
