She surprised me at work in December for my birthday with this thing of absolute beauty!  The cake was vanilla, with vanilla butter icing, and it tasted just as good as it looked... the skin, fins, etc. were made of fondant... and the whole thing hand painted with edible cake paint... simply amazing! She made it the right size too (48"") hahaha... she didn't want a musky CAKE to be my first 50 hahahaha!!!  In production   Even the scale texture was imprinted in the fondant skin...   Even did the teeth out of fondant!   Thanks again girl - it truly made my day!  Pete"
