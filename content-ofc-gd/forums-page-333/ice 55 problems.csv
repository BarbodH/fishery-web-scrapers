755727,jay27fish,2013-01-02 02:08:00,37,my ice 55 is not working well wont pick up my jig on screen anymore. when i drop it down in my buddys hole his works fine im thinking its the transducer. even on max gain it just wont work. ive sent it back to get repaired because sail in oshawa wont do a exchange. (it happened 2 days after i bought it last year). they sent it to north bay for repair it came back and they left a note saying nothing wrong should i just spend the 80 bucks on a transducer or does anybody no how to fix this or whats going on with it ?  Oh went to partridge lake near carnarvan today with no success. two nibbles. marked about 20 fish on buddys flasher though not sure what they were but prob brookies.
755730,Terry,2013-01-02 02:14:00,14456,I would find someone with the same ducer and try it on yours or call north bay and ask them how it works for them but not for you  do you have the noise rejection too high
755731,jay27fish,2013-01-02 02:16:00,37,  had it on all 10 settings nothing changed
755736,Meegs,2013-01-02 02:45:00,249,"Had same problem, got in touch with customer service at johnstone outdoors I think, its been afew years, they sent a new ducer no charge and fixed problem. Ill try to find that contact info for you"
755745,trapshooter,2013-01-02 03:51:00,1234,Try taking the transducer clip/support cable off.  Just let the ducer hang from the transducer cord.  That other cord can make the transducer hang off kiel / off centre.  WOrked for me.
756663,jay27fish,2013-01-05 23:42:00,37,ordered a transducer should be in monday hope this works!
