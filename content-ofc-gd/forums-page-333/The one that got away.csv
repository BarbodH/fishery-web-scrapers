My brother and I had fished for hours without even a sniff. We were just about to pack it in when I got a hit. I set the hook(felt weird) and all of a sudden my drag is screamin! I yell at my brother to come help because I think I got the loch ness monster on the end of my rod. Fought this thing for about 5 minutes back and forth until I started winning. I tell my brother to get ready because it's getting close. The next thing you know a branch comes out of the hole. What the heck is that I scream. My brother says you caught a stick with some line on it and there's a monster pike on the end!! He grabs the stick and try's to hand line it and snap(hate that sound) the dang line breaks  Big pike gone. Only fish we saw in 3 days. One lucky pike.
