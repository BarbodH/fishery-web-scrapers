Lots of closures....the MTO website can't even keep up. I guess we are making up for the generally good driving conditions and mild winter from last year.  http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/traveller/trip/map.shtml?ll=50.148746,-85.605468&z=5"

Sure glad I took my compass with me though... to go shut the compressor off in the hangar. I might have ended up in the swampy area to the east of the hangar door, from yesterdays spring weather, and had to call 911 on my cell phone to be rescued!"

764293,Joey,2013-02-01 03:22:00,9122,"Took me an hour to get to work this morn, normally 20 minutes in rush hour.  Was sitting there in traffic, not moving, then see a car going the opposite direction sideways!!!  Ended up backwards and took a few minutes to gather their wits and traffic waited for them to turn around and get right again  Then, of course, it happened all over again on the way home with the next blast"
