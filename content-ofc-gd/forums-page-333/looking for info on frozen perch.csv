763923,skinny,2013-01-30 23:15:00,442,ok so Sunday I went ice fishing with a buddy. turned out to be a long day that was great but little fish.  anyway I draged home 5 perch. When I arived homethe wife was having a gathering of friends from work so i wasn't going to filet the fish  i stuck them in a bag and stuffed them in the freezer to do later well i forgot them till today so can I take them out thaw them filet them and refreeze them or should I filet and cook there isn't enough for the family to have so I need to becareful of when if I need to cook right away 
763935,Nipfisher,2013-01-30 23:35:00,2449,I would say....filet and eat. Yummy snack.
763939,kemper,2013-01-30 23:44:00,2232,"I was always taught to at least gut the fish before freezing, so I've always done it that way.  Never really questioned it either way to be honest..."
763942,skinny,2013-01-30 23:54:00,442,normally i do the filet thing right away but this time i was kinda between rock and hard spot
763955,Rod Caster,2013-01-31 00:42:00,5784,"I'd suggest you thaw and eat... Most meat can't handle double freezing without losing flavor or posing a health risk (like chicken). Its only 5 small ones, so take 'em out the day before you eat them, filet and throw in pan right away. No issues there.  I've kept full walleye in my fridge for a couple days and the meat was still ok and didn't taste any different"
763989,Rich,2013-01-31 02:40:00,3927,"As long as the blood does not thaw and get into the meat. It will coagulate (sp?) and you will get sick my friend. Cut the heads off & gut, as soon as you pull em out, and eat em."
763998,Joeytier,2013-01-31 03:29:00,3990,The meat likely won't taste as good if you were to fillet then refreeze.  eat em' up
764001,mike rousseau,2013-01-31 03:32:00,4661,I've done it without any issues... 
764020,Rich,2013-01-31 10:50:00,3927,"Would you do that with chicken thighs? Poultry/fish possess the same dangers of salmonella and E.coli and yes they are far more common than admitted from said situations ... Like fish freezing, thawing, then being re-frozen. Blood goes bad when it thaws... Fast."
764044,Rich,2013-01-31 14:48:00,3927,"Okay, whatever. Lol im just a butcher who trains food safety weekly."
764051,jim,2013-01-31 15:08:00,124,"I have always frozen my fish whole, pull out the day I'm eating them and fillet.  If you leave them intact in the freezer, you won't get freezer burn, except maybe fins and skin.  The meat stays perfect."
