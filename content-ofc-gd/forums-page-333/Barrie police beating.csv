763373,Terry,2013-01-29 09:42:00,14456,because it is in the courts right now and the facts are finally coming out..it is a local matter and we are being flooded with info on the local news
763382,Rich,2013-01-29 12:52:00,3927,"I'm not really interested in how effective punishment is. I'm interested in the fact that there is a baffling number of public servants, paid to PROTECT the innocent, doing the complete opposite. How did these guys get jobs as cops in the first place?"
763392,BillM,2013-01-29 13:31:00,17367, Feel free to pay him 20mil out of your own pocket.
763397,outllaw,2013-01-29 13:57:00,1232,years back i dialed 9-11. the police were on site within 45 seconds. they deserve a good rap. the fellow at hand will have his day in court. sadly seems he snapped.
763420,Freshtrax,2013-01-29 15:15:00,2215,"Until the kid supina'd  the mall this evidence never came out and the kid was charged with multiple offences.  As soon as his lawyer got his hands on the video all charges were dropped against the kid  and an opp investigation began against the officer.    That's the worst part , without the video this kid would have done jail time.    Video was only made public jan 25 th.   ."
763428,LeXXington,2013-01-29 15:33:00,1928,"There are bad apples in every profession from Doctors, teachers to priests.  Dirty Cop carear is over The Mall will get sued The police will get sued The mall security will get sued  The poor guys trama at being a victim will be the hardest thing to get rid of..  Sad Event"
763438,jimmer,2013-01-29 16:14:00,2730,"The scary part is that this could happen to any of us if we questioned what that officer was insinuating. He should lose his job, pension and any respect he might have. Disgusting! Especially with the number of 3 to one."
763442,Terry,2013-01-29 16:20:00,14456,"not to mention , how many other people went to jail or paid fines, on this liars word......his arrest statement was one big lie..... he should do big jail time.."
763494,ch312,2013-01-29 18:55:00,1590, he sure did snap...for the THIRD time!!!  the third time that we actually know of. who knows how many other people have felt the wraith of this pathetic excuse for a mans power trips.   it says a lot about the department he works for
763513,Lunkerhunter,2013-01-29 19:47:00,455,"the cop deserves to get whats coming to him.... scares the living crap out of me to be honest, to think this could happen to anyone.  what really bugs me as well is the security guards... you think they would have maybe said something to someone in regards to this incident... they are just as much to blame as the officer. they held the guy down as the cop beat the hell out of the citizen.  im surprised they have not been dragged into this yet more than they have"
763539,Cudz,2013-01-29 21:26:00,2652,"Yeah.  But think about it. They are not cops and they would be afraid to tell him to calm down.  IF you watch the video again, near the end just before the other cop comes, the security guy in the yellow tries to stop the cop from hitting and body slamming the guy in cuffs."
763552,fishing n autograph,2013-01-29 22:21:00,2540,Unfortunately no one in Canada does big time jail time for anything....  
763556,fishing n autograph,2013-01-29 22:28:00,2540,"Probably not and although his credibility is now completely shot, his honesty and credibility will only be called into question on future court cases. Which means this guy will never be in an investigative position again if convicted of deceit under the PSA"

763564,wall i,2013-01-29 22:41:00,48,  Your kiddin right...resisting arrest??? The cop jumped him and continued to beat him even after handcuffing!! Lets beat everyone and then wait for the investigation to get all the info. Disgusting.
763577,lookinforwalleye,2013-01-29 23:09:00,4399, Somebody needs a hug!!!
763613,SirCranksalot,2013-01-30 00:49:00,3291,The all too frequent cases of police brutality and wrongful convictions is seriously eroding people's confidence in our legal system.
764790,Alex416,2013-02-03 00:42:00,22,you guys have no idea how much of this goes on. I live in a rougher part of Toronto and I grew seeing stuff like this and have also experienced it
763110,Fisherman,2013-01-28 13:54:00,7201,"It's not the first time for this cop, he has a history, that's all I'll say."
763112,jedimaster,2013-01-28 13:56:00,3472,I thought judge dredd was the only cop allowed to convict and punish and arrest. I always thought police were to investigate and arrest. Too often people let power go to there heads.
763114,moxie,2013-01-28 14:07:00,1566,"Sent chills down my spine while watching it earlier this week. Here's hoping our ""Legal System"" metes out Justice."
763120,tapout,2013-01-28 14:13:00,166,Whats interesting is the police officers who are members of this board are staying mum on the subject!
763121,Nipfisher,2013-01-28 14:18:00,2449,Didn't take them long to rinse away the guys blood.
763122,bushart,2013-01-28 14:20:00,2628,  For the most cases---being a police officer is an admirable job where they lay their lives down to protect ours----a job I would not want  As in everything One suspect apple does not show the barrel
763123,moxie,2013-01-28 14:21:00,1566,"That goes on a lot these days. People belonging to groups and associations, whether they be religious, cultural or otherwise, more increasingly seem afraid to speak out against one of their own. This is what leads to biases from the public. It's a shame."
763126,Marko,2013-01-28 14:23:00,854,"Is it really that hard to find couple of friends and figure out who these ""cops"" are and you make things even? Street justice...eye for an eye.....thats prety low even for the guys in blue"
763131,Cast-Away,2013-01-28 14:52:00,790,It takes a big man to keep beating someone who is not only on the ground but being held down by two others. They should all be ashamed of themselves. The 3 of them are bullies and cowards. Enough said.
763134,adempsey,2013-01-28 14:58:00,1498,"This is happening far too often and very little seems to be being done about it.  I found this article disturbing too.  Basically three officers beat the crap out of some old guy.  Guess what?  All officers innocent, old man charged.  To top it off one of those officers was previously charged with discreditable conduct under the Police Services Act after being accused of allowing a drunken female to play with his loaded gun in exchange for a date.   He was also previously charged with impaired driving, but the case was thrown out because the judge ruled it took too long to get to trial.  What the hell is going on?  What would drive these people to do this?"
763138,ecmilley,2013-01-28 15:03:00,2163,video won't open for me
763155,BucktownAngler,2013-01-28 15:34:00,582," i would also like to hear them chime in on this    this is very true  i just hope this doesnt get swept under the rug. if it does, it might be saying something about the barrel"
763156,fishing n autograph,2013-01-28 15:35:00,2540,Bullies and morons in ever walk of life. Police are no different.  And if you believe cops get away with everything you should see how much average every day civilians get away with. Only 65% of criminals in Ontario get convicted.
763158,torco,2013-01-28 15:39:00,656,Just terrible but thankfully there was a security camera and this officer will be dealt with appropriately as part of the justice system. I don't want to jump over all cops because there are bad apples in every bunch.
763161,BucktownAngler,2013-01-28 15:48:00,582,"  how many civilians get away with DUI?  id like to know how many officers get away with DUI, when its frowned upon to arrest a fellow officer.  http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/crime/article/1202587--rookie-cop-takes-heat-for-arresting-off-duty-officer"

763179,fishing n autograph,2013-01-28 16:45:00,2540, More than you realize. There's about a 5% conviction rate for drunk drivers in the GTA right now. 
763182,fishing n autograph,2013-01-28 16:47:00,2540,And to tell you the truth every copper I know personally that got hooked up for impaired was found guilty.  The rags that we call news papers only want the juicy stuff so when a copper does it it sells papers. When a copper gets off its horrible but on a daily basis drunk drivers get off and not a word is said about it.
763190,Freshtrax,2013-01-28 17:28:00,2215,I have some good friends that are officers.  I didn't want to start a bash the police thread.   I just want to raise awareness for this incident so Jason Nevills   doesn't get a third victim. There are bad apples in every walk of life.
763193,jedimaster,2013-01-28 17:30:00,3472, If they don't get convicted in court by a judge or jury of peers they are not criminals.... Its not up to the arresting officers to determine guilt. jmho. And I don't want to stir the pot. Just saying is all...
763217,ch312,2013-01-28 19:05:00,1590, really? why on earth was he allowed to keep his job if he has done this in the past?  here's to hoping they all lose their jobs and karma pays them a visit...
763296,tb4me,2013-01-29 00:25:00,3295,Wow that's sad..Seems pretty cut n dry to me.. I have the utmost respect for Police and what they do..In this case I hope the officer and the 2 security guards get what's coming to them in the court of law..
763358,GreenCanada,2013-01-29 04:45:00,375,"This isn't the first police beating without cause and won't be the last. There are many honest, respectful, and hardworking police officers, but unfortunately there are also a large number of bullies who just want a badge and a gun."

763042,Freshtrax,2013-01-28 01:37:00,2215,This is disgusting if you read the article it's over a broken Christmas ornament.  http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=ou1nVGePLaQ&desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dou1nVGePLaQ  I hope he gets charged with attempted murder and gets put in general population in the pen...but you know he probably won't serve a day.
763043,Joey,2013-01-28 01:40:00,9122,Saw that this week.  I was disgusted also
763045,Terry,2013-01-28 01:43:00,14456,"what scares the hell out of me is if there was no video, no one would have believed the kid and the cop would have gone free... how many others did he beat , how many people went to jail on his word"
763048,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-28 01:51:00,10439,All I see is a cop trying to arrest someone and the guy is resisting arrest. Don't know what caused the initial problem but who's to say the kid didn't spit in the cops face? I'm sure the investigation will get all the info out there.
763049,irishfield,2013-01-28 01:54:00,26272,I'm wondering what he called his mother... but a common theme with the Barrie Police dept... Unfortunate there's no sound... would tell a better tale.
763051,Terry,2013-01-28 01:57:00,14456,"until the video came out the cop said he resisted arrest and the cop said he feared for his life, no spitting if anyone sees him resisting or scaring the cop..you had better look again.. I see an abuse of power and a reason to fear cops"
763052,solopaddler,2013-01-28 01:57:00,8605," I didn't see the kid do anything to justify that kind of beating. What got me was the cops throwing buckets of water on the blood to wash it away.  There's always two sides though, I'd love to hear the explanation."
763053,chris.brock,2013-01-28 02:03:00,4053,"brutal, I hope he loses his job/ pension, and serves some long jail time  he's a real tough guy with a gun in his holster and 2 cops there as back-up, beating on a smaller guy  these cops seem to have free pass to avoid prosecution though, he's likely at home, with pay, until this gets swept under the rug  like Terry said, how often does this happen when there's no video footage?"
763054,Jet,2013-01-28 02:07:00,364,"Here's some more background on the incident.  http://www.thebarrieexaminer.com/2013/01/23/barrie-police-officer-facing-several-charges-following-incident-at-bayfield-mall  Excerpt: ""Court heard how Nevill later told police that Stern had attacked him first by kneeing him in the groin, and that he only punched Stern twice. However, the video shows Nevill delivering about a dozen blows to Stern’s head without ever being attacked."""
763055,chris.brock,2013-01-28 02:07:00,4053," I wouldn't call that resisting  the investigation is likely a load of biased Bull anyways  I'd like to see jail time and, bye- bye public sector job/ pension"
763056,Freshtrax,2013-01-28 02:08:00,2215, You didn't read any articles on the matter  eh....in th officers official report he said the kid kneed him in the groin that's why he put him down.   Don't know about you but I don't see a knee.  I also don't see any resisting.
763057,Rod Caster,2013-01-28 02:19:00,5784,"Wow. That's scary and a complete abuse of power. I hope all the authorities in that video get publicly shamed and punished. I used to be nervous about cameras being everywhere, but they work in holding everyone accountable... Very very disturbing video."
763058,Rich Nelson,2013-01-28 02:20:00,332,"Nobody knows what the kid did to begin with. ( his friend breaking a christmas ornament is Bull) The initial takedown may not have been necessary, but its obvious from the video that two of the security guys were struggling to get his hands behind his back. It looks harsh, but nobody knows the real story.."
763059,Freshtrax,2013-01-28 02:29:00,2215,Why wash  the blood away? And fabricate a report if they thought they did nothing wrong?
763060,Terry,2013-01-28 02:31:00,14456,"yeah but he was not really being arrested, he was being assaulted by a cop and 2 store dicks and he committed no crime if I was in his place I would fear for my life and struggle to live too"
763061,Rod Caster,2013-01-28 02:31:00,5784,....M
763064,NAW,2013-01-28 02:41:00,4022,"Saw this last week.  Not nice.  I've seen Barrie.  Cops in the alleys behind Dunlop laying a d ack down more than once.  Some people deserve it and some people don't.  Judging souly on the video, I would say the latter of the two in this situation."
763068,Burtess,2013-01-28 02:56:00,901,Thats freaking crazy!  Resisting arrest??  Doesn't a Police Officer normally tell you he is going to arrest you and then ask you to comply before jumping on you and giving you a beating? There was no time for this kid to resist.  I hope the other two get charged too.....  Burt
763073,bigugli,2013-01-28 03:16:00,6138,Reminds me of the days of the cherry beach express
763074,Cudz,2013-01-28 03:33:00,2652,"Not cool.  My favourite statement from the cop was ""I was fighting for my life, and losing"".  What???? Really?? 3 vs 1 and you were fighting for your life?  There was only one guy fighting for his life there and he wasn't a cop or a mall cop."
763089,pics,2013-01-28 08:04:00,1268,This guy makes the good cops look bad. Hope his career is done...
763095,misfish,2013-01-28 10:49:00,29133,"You can bet,the two rent a cops,will be getting theirs. And it wont be like it,s the first time it has happen here. The cop will be toast.If he dosent get time,Im sure ,time will come to him.  That was total  Bull"
763097,outllaw,2013-01-28 11:01:00,1232,reminds me of windsor ont.. they even beat a doctor here.
763098,Rich,2013-01-28 11:02:00,3927,That guy did pretty good considering there was three big armed men randomly attacking him.
763101,fishinmortician,2013-01-28 12:21:00,100,Let go from work WITH pay! Hope he has to pay back every cent!
