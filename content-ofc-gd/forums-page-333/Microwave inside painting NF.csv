763902,Muskieman,2013-01-30 22:06:00,2472,"Funny you say this , my microwave caught fire yesterday , chipped paint around the turn table shaft , turn table plastic supports caught fire .( no damage to the house ) blackened cupboards is all . I then started looking for a right hand hinged door , sounds easy eh ? Impossible unless you want to spend over 700 $ for a 1.5 cu/ft unit ... 1.5 cu/ft stainless unit on sale at CTC right now for 99$ , replace it ... but .. take the old one apart  and keep the magnet .. Well worth it , very strong ! If you're for painting it , epoxy paint would be the way to go I'd guess ..."

Mines a 1.5,hard to get for a good price,but $99 doesn't sound bad at all."
