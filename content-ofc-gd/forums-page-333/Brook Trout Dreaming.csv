For the past 9 years I have been tagging brook trout as part of the co-operative angler program for the MNR to study the health of the brook trout population. Analysis of the combined data  by biologists indicates the population is stable and that 95% of all anglers report using varying degrees of “catch and release”.  For those of you who have nothing better to do these cold days, here is a link to the document that looks at the rehabilitation of the brook trout population for the past 5 years.http://www.thegreaterlakesuperiorfoundation.org/pdf/2011CoasterWorkshopProceedingsFINAL.pdfI hope you enjoy the sampling of photos and short video about my 2012 season.

764787,spincast,2013-02-03 00:37:00,3279,Love the vid - those are some beauty fish. Hope to find a few of those this year. Heading up to Nipigon as a bucket list item. It's a friend's 50th so what better way to recognise it?

764803,Moosebunk,2013-02-03 01:09:00,3970,"Well Al.  I was able to read through all.. at a quick glance.  Some encouraging results with restoration efforts and alot of great effort by many involved.  It's awesome, and I hope it continues.  Pics as always were excellent, and the vid is surely showtime for the speck enthusiast.  You love 'em... there's no denying.  Gotta be hard getting through the long winter in wait.  Thanks for the post.  I'll pass along the MNR link to a couple friends interested.  Maybe the Rebel's will share the water again this year."
