He told the jeweller he was looking for a special ring for his girlfriend. The jeweller looked through his stock and brought out a $5000 ring. The man said ""No no, I'd like to see something more special."" At that statement, the jeweller went over to his special stock and brought another ring over. ""Here's a stunning ring at only $40,000"" the jeweller said. The lady's eyes sparkled and her body trembled with excitement. The old man said ""We'll take it."" The jeweller asked how payment would be made and the man stated, ""By check. I know you need to make sure that the check is good, so I'll write it now and you can call the bank on Monday to verify the funds, and I'll pick up the ring on Monday afternoon."" On Monday morning the jeweller angrily phoned the old man and said, ""there's no money in that account"". ""I know"", said the old man, ""but let me tell you about MY GREAT WEEKEND!"""
