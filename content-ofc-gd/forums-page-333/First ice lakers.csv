763476,frozen-fire,2013-01-29 18:11:00,542,"  In the end, it likely wasn't anywhere close to 20lbs...I never weigh any fish, but I'd say it's around 15 . The excitement really gets to you! My biggest for sure so far. It's a very cool thing to see the fish swimming around at your feet through the clear solid ice.  Pic doesn't do it justice   Release. 8"" hole.   We did well and ended up with lots of fish on the ice, but also lost ridiculous numbers of fish bringing them up as well.               Just wanted to share"
