763614,BillM,2013-01-30 00:49:00,17367,  LOL!!!
763637,Freshtrax,2013-01-30 01:53:00,2215, Your right I don't carry a bonkin stick on he ice.   I woulda just let him freeze.   The only one I've seen close to that one is the mount in cannings.
763675,2jack2,2013-01-30 04:37:00,92,I should have call in sick and went with you. nice fish!!
763890,Cudz,2013-01-30 21:42:00,2652,Man that is unreal!! I have know the record was 14. pounds for years. Congrats!  You are the new world record holder!  Well your name will never be in the books but we all know. Awesome
763930,David Chong,2013-01-30 23:26:00,836,Giant Fish! Nice job!
763956,brkygetr,2013-01-31 00:43:00,425," Agreed...that fish is awesome. It's a hard choice that most of us will never know....good on ya. I can only imagine the feeling of watching it slip away into the dark, keeping those genetics out there for the future. Simply unreal...."
763962,Rod Caster,2013-01-31 01:15:00,5784,"Oh man! I'd go all ""double rainbow"" if I caught a fish like that."
764000,Headhunter,2013-01-31 03:32:00,5703, That's one massive Whitie... congrats and thanks for sharing... HH
763066,Cudz,2013-01-28 02:50:00,2652,That could be a world record fish!  Nice!
763083,moxie,2013-01-28 04:21:00,1566,"Nice fish. Sure hope you at least documented the specs on that Mutant. Again, nice fish."
763091,wormdunker,2013-01-28 10:22:00,1711,"It's a hawg!  Good for you!  Definitely crowding 15 lbs.  Punch in his nose, put a curly tail on it & you'll find it on a farm  It's where bacon comes from."
763108,chrispyke,2013-01-28 13:42:00,51, Were the 'little' guy and the PIG caught on the same day ?  If so did you not have the scale....or worse did it run out of batteries ?  Could you imagine thinking you've caught a WR and the scale blinks out....
763128,Doctrt,2013-01-28 14:32:00,141," Oh I weighed it...and like I said, I probably should have kept it.  Lets just say it was very, very, very big.  Just couldn't bring myself to kill her."
763130,BillM,2013-01-28 14:45:00,17367,Good job man letting a beast like that go..   No wonder the lake trout in that lake get so big  :)
763162,mr blizzard,2013-01-28 15:50:00,1589,"Looks like a Killarney fish , got some big ones up there but definitely not as big as that, nice job letting her go"
763180,chrispyke,2013-01-28 16:46:00,51," That is awesome dude!!  Not everyone would release a world class, potentially world record fish!!  Great Job !"
763311,Moosebunk,2013-01-29 00:51:00,3970,Holy that cucumber would make one big salty pickle on the wall.  Fine whitey!
763329,NAC,2013-01-29 01:47:00,369,"Can't say I've ever seen a whitie that big, great fish for sure!"
763333,Cudz,2013-01-29 02:00:00,2652,Don't keep us in suspense.  Tell us the weight.  15++?
763344,reelinrolly,2013-01-29 02:50:00,281,Hahaha.   Love it.   Congrats on what would be a catch of a lifetime for many'!!
763356,Doctrt,2013-01-29 03:42:00,141,"This is where things usually go south but here it is.  No the scale is not certified, but it is accurate, and yes it is photoshopped...to hide the shoreline "
763359,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-29 04:47:00,10439,Nice!!! Shoulda bonked it and claimed the all tackle WR. I have no doubt that weight is accurate. I have the older version of that scale and we tested it against a certified Chatillion scale up at the lodge and found my 50# scale accurate up to 70#'s. I didn't want to go any higher for fear of breaking it.
763368,tonka-toy,2013-01-29 07:36:00,139,"Hey guys,Tim has dragged me out for whities and lakers a few times.Those few uneventful trips have led to me refer to them as unicorns and bigfoot,as i saw no evidence of these creatures.Well no more ribbing him about whitefish.What a day.He landed 3, I got 1(the little guy).The two other he didn't note weighed 9lbs7oz and 11lbs5oz.He was aware of the record and against the advice of all present,simply slipped her back.Congrats Tim."
763424,Freshtrax,2013-01-29 15:22:00,2215,Good on ya for lettin it go.    I would have been ruthless and bonked it.
763460,moxie,2013-01-29 17:14:00,1566,"All i could find as far as a ""Lake Whitefish "" World Record was a weight of 14.6 lbs back in 1984. If that's correct the weight of your fish would be a clear winner even if you took away almost 2 lbs. Witnesses+sworn affidavits+ Style points(Catch & Release) could= IGFA World Record? Am I way off base here?   http://wrec.igfa.org/WRecordsList.aspx?lc=AllTackle&cn=Whitefish,%20lake"
763464,torco,2013-01-29 17:21:00,656,Congrats on what is likely a world record fish. It takes a strong character to release a potential world record fish.
763495,JoshS,2013-01-29 18:56:00,729,Awesome fish!!! what a pig
763503,jedimaster,2013-01-29 19:14:00,3472,"Yep, thats a record man, http://www.ofah.org/downloads/getfile.php?id=PDF/fish/RecordFish.pdf Unfortunatly you need to keep it and stick it in the freezer to qualify."
763542,ecmilley,2013-01-29 21:32:00,2163,"nice catch, and since your scale is accurate I would think it's the biggest whitefish any of us have seen. Thanks for sharing"
763548,jedimaster,2013-01-29 21:47:00,3472,Scale or no scale that thing is an absolute monster. You should really consider applying for the IGFA world record for catch and release.
763550,moxie,2013-01-29 22:09:00,1566,x2
763558,Nipfisher,2013-01-29 22:32:00,2449," Or you could just throw it on the ice and let it suffocate?   Good for you for letting it go. Although, my guess is that if it is ever caught again it will not swim away."
763572,moxie,2013-01-29 22:57:00,1566,Please don't tell us you inserted a digit into its' anus a la HeadHunter either.
762867,Doctrt,2013-01-27 01:37:00,141,"  Oh well, the cat's out of the bag. This is usually where things go south but here it is...and no, it is not a certified scale, but it is accurate, and yes, it has been photoshopped, to hide the shoreline"
762870,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-27 01:44:00,10439,That's a chunk alright!!!
762876,BillM,2013-01-27 01:55:00,17367,LOL!!!!!
762883,chrispyke,2013-01-27 02:53:00,51,Nice Fish !!!  How big?... gotta be 10 lbs +++
762888,dheitzner,2013-01-27 03:22:00,314,"Sweet fish, gotta be from Simcoe?"
762891,Doctrt,2013-01-27 03:37:00,141,"No, not Simcoe.  And as far as how big she was, lets just say I probably should have kept her"
762903,GbayGiant,2013-01-27 04:09:00,1780,6 to 7 pound georgian Bay Whitefish. Average size for Simcoe as well. Nice fish.
762906,Doctrt,2013-01-27 04:17:00,141, Wow. Pic must be bad cause you're not even close!
762907,tonka-toy,2013-01-27 04:17:00,139,put the head shot up tim

762952,limeyangler,2013-01-27 15:26:00,5204,Awesome....biggest whitie i've ever seen.
762959,EC1,2013-01-27 16:17:00,930,"Sweet whitie, especially if it's not from simcoe."
762962,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-27 16:50:00,10439,Could be a GB fish. I have caught them to 11#'s out of Owen Sound and Meaford.
762970,chrispyke,2013-01-27 17:52:00,51,"I've seen some big whities off the trawlers in GB in 10 - 12 range this seems bigger, longer and FAT !"
762979,Steve,2013-01-27 19:26:00,2075,that is the biggest six to seven pound fish i've ever seen....  its easily over 10lbs...likely closer to 15lbs.
762990,Doctrt,2013-01-27 20:58:00,141,"Another one from yesterday. Just a 'little' guy at 12, 13  "
762992,tonka-toy,2013-01-27 21:13:00,139,"post the head shot of the big one, it shows the massive shoulders."

763027,Joeytier,2013-01-28 00:16:00,3990,Woah...enormous whitie
763046,BassMan11,2013-01-28 01:45:00,583,Well considering the world record is 14lbs6oz. I see what your saying.
763050,irishfield,2013-01-28 01:56:00,26272,Glad to see that background disappeared....
