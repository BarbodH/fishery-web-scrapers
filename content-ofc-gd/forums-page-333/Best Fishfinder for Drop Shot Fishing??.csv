763636,reelinrolly,2013-01-30 01:48:00,281,I am currently starting to research different fish finders for my boat for next season.  I want one on the bow that would be effective for drop shotting.  What are some of your favourite units you have used??  What sort of things should I watch out for??  Thanks for any tips....appreciate it
763641,jedimaster,2013-01-30 02:02:00,3472,What kind of depths? Are you gonne just verticle jig in deeper water for smallies and walleye type thing? If so I would go for a flasher. Down scanners or side scanners are great if you are covering water slowly but if you are trying to finesse stubborn fish while holding a single spot in deeper water a flasher will give you excellent results.
763726,ecmilley,2013-01-30 14:26:00,2163,"On my ranger I have a hds-8 with full down/side scan and when i am at the front of the boat i have a under 200 bones older hummingbird 140 colour unit when i am jigging or drop shotting that little bird has no problems showing my line going down to bottom in 30 ft it also has rts mode and flasher mode, sometimes I regret the over 3k i have in the lowrance as the bird marks just about as much"
763727,Rich,2013-01-30 14:29:00,3927,"That's a pretty basic feature on a graph. Basically you want something sensitive enough to see your bait in 50' or less of water im guessing? If so, any finder will work. My pihranamax 215 ($80 used) shows all that."
763788,reelinrolly,2013-01-30 17:23:00,281,Thanks for all the tips guys  I should of specified more. I will mainly be fishing on the St Clair river for smallies and walleye. The river has quite the current.  My depths will range from 10 ft to 70 ft. ( mouth of Lake Huron)  I have a vexilar for ice fishing but didn't know if flashers would be that effective on moving water.  Any finders better in current than others??
763814,uglyfish,2013-01-30 19:04:00,981,lowrance hds8 or humminbird 998 HD si. both are great for what u want. large clear hi def screens.
763824,reelinrolly,2013-01-30 19:37:00,281,I under a grand preferably lol
763932,David Chong,2013-01-30 23:31:00,836,I'd look at the new Lowrance Elite 7HDI beautiful unit with downscan. I do belive Radioworld has them for $700! I'll probably put 2 of these at the front of my boat this year and I drop shot a lot! Dave
