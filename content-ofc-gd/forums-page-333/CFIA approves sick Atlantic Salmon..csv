764325,mike rousseau,2013-02-01 14:40:00,4661,Gross  Glad I only eat what I catch...
764331,Christopheraaron,2013-02-01 15:03:00,3525,Gross. I'll stick with my perch for now
764350,chris.brock,2013-02-01 15:53:00,4053,"I'm ok with that, I don't like the thought of wasting fish/ livestock unnecessarily like they did with the Alberta beef a few months ago  it looks like it saves a few tax dollars too, by not having to compensate the fish farmer  it could be shock to a consumer who buys a fillet in a package, skin side down, gets it home, fires up the BBQ, then notices some nasty lesions after the package is opened"
764373,Fisherman,2013-02-01 17:50:00,7201,I think they should make the politicians and CFIA gorge themselves on that.
764378,jedimaster,2013-02-01 18:21:00,3472,Its also safe to eat fish with worms growing inside of there flesh... yummy
764400,bigugli,2013-02-01 20:16:00,6138,The politics of money is the only basis behind this decision.
764413,danjang,2013-02-01 21:16:00,148,"I'm pretty sure a lot of foods have nasty ailments in our grocery stores. Fish we catch here too! Very common to have worms and cysts. If we only ate things that were 100% healthy we'd have nothing on our plate.  I would be more concerned about the possible spread of the virus to other salmonids in unaffected populations.  If this is transported throughout the country, we could have a problem!"
764422,Rich,2013-02-01 21:41:00,3927,It's highly likely that any big box grocery chain would send that back to the warehouse for a credit anyway. It will eventually find it's way to makeup companies or shoddy discount fish markets.
