764269,Terry,2013-02-01 02:00:00,14456,I want it or half of it
764274,Twocoda,2013-02-01 02:15:00,4130,why not charge rescued survivors with attempted suicide instead....and then they will have to prove their sanity in a court of law....losing that court battle will have adverse effects on their life moving forward...and if they win that battle....i could pretty much gaurantee....they will think a little more logically the next time they venture out on the ice....
764280,chessy,2013-02-01 02:24:00,610,found this .... they are all set up for people that dare to go out when ice is not safe  
764286,Twocoda,2013-02-01 02:42:00,4130,you are correct Sinclair....I am ....my remark was sarcasm because its the only natural defense to stupidity...lol... 
764090,glen,2013-01-31 18:25:00,2641,Great post guys. Rich I agree with you. They call the ice unsafe when its two ft thick.  Taxes should be covering the bill. A lot of other people get rescued from stupid stuff and they don't get fined.  Hello 911 you there?  I am just calling to let you know I am going to die on the ice today. What ever you do don't send anyone out to get me because I don't want my girlfriend to have to pay the fine.  I am going to start a rescue service and undercut the fire dept. see how they like it when they don't have any calls to go to.
764099,glen,2013-01-31 18:44:00,2641,charge people for being stupid  They can't help it if they were born that way.

764109,jedimaster,2013-01-31 19:10:00,3472," In the home instance yes you will pay for service.Thats just hoe it goes. Its not free for them to show up and put the fire out. You will get a bill. If you don't pay it gets added to your following years tax bill.  It depends on the municipality how much and what services you pay for.  For toronto here are the fees for an automobile response.   28.     Emergency Response to vehicle incident - non City resident First hour or part thereof, per fire vehicle                                     300.00  29.

764112,Oggie,2013-01-31 19:12:00,588,One of these fines needs to make it to court.  It'll be the judges ruling that determines the future actions of municipalities. IMO. I'm not a lawyer BTW. Dan o.

764129,Sinker,2013-01-31 20:03:00,8692,"How about this. If authorities want to make the call on whether the ice is actually safe or not, they have to go out and actually set foot on it, drill some holes, measure it, look for cracks.....you know....monitor the ice.  They call the ice unsafe, but in reality, they have no clue what the ice is like, and no experience on the ice. One persons safety level is much different than the next, but there are times when it is just stupid for a person to be on the ice. Take the last simcoe ice rescue for example, and the big ice break up last year as well.  S."
764131,jedimaster,2013-01-31 20:09:00,3472,"I have been doing a fair bit of digging and Search and Rescue charges are a big issue in many outdoors activities...I don't think  any government body anywhere would ever say any ice is safe. Just like how the MNR wouldn't post signs saying there is hunting in this area ot hunting in that area to warn hikers. Doing so would mean they are accepting some sort of liability. I mean we have all heard them say ""Ice if unsafe"" have you ever heard them go back on tv and say ""ok its been below 0 for a week and the ice is safe again"". Never not gonna happen."
764141,jedimaster,2013-01-31 20:44:00,3472,"Just got word back from OFAH, and they will not cover rescue fees. However they will cover medical transportation while fishing upto 1000 dollars to the nearest hospital."
764154,jay27fish,2013-01-31 21:20:00,37,"every ice rescue call in kawartha lakes requires 3 halls to respond.(dont mean to piss ppl off its the facts) you need your resuce crew and a backup crew and a R.I.T. (rapid intervention team) as well as ppl to set up equipment cause you cant do it in a rescure suit as well as ppl to help you into the suits, line handlers, incident commander and a scene safety officer. as well as medical crew and general equipment operators. it sounds like alot but ontario has lost a few FF's in the last few years due to ice rescue situations and protocols have changed big time it used to be a one hall 5 guy operations but workplace safety boards and section 21 guidlines have fire depts across ontario by the balls. ive been a volunteer for 7 years now and the changes have been drastic. we have never fined anyone for needing help though that just bad PR. mistakes are mad all the time!"

You do it because you want to and I've never seen anyone sent a bill for burning down half of Ontario because of an unresponsible camp fire.... despite the $5000 PER HOUR cost of a water bomber!
764010,porkpie,2013-01-31 05:32:00,2521,Most volunteer fire departments are anything but these days.  They have to pay an hourly wage of some sort because the days of bein given a pager and being told to hop on a truck are long since over.  The extra training and intrusion on family life in a halfway busy volunteer fire coverage area causes about a 3 year turn over rate in a lot of departments.  The wage is to provide an incentive and aid in retention.
764012,rickster,2013-01-31 05:38:00,495,"well how about these  MINDEN – A Kushog Lake cottager has been ordered to pay $6,745. for a fire that burned .22 hectares of the Frost Centre Management Area.  A resident of Toronto, plead guilty to starting the fire at his Kushog Lake cottage. He was ordered to pay fire suppression costs incurred by the Township of Algonquin Highlands and the Ministry of Natural Resources in putting out the blaze.  Court was told that on May 26, 2007, at approximately 2:30 p.m., the man ignited a rubbish pile on his cottage lot on Kushog Lake’s east shore. The man left the immediate vicinity of the fire and at approximately 4:30 p.m. he noticed a large plume of smoke rising up from the fire site. The man called the Algonquin Highlands fire department who extinguished the blaze that had spread into the surrounding forest.  A joint investigation by the ministry’s Haliburton Fire Base and Minden conservation officers revealed that no permit had been issued for the fire. There were no tools or water on site to contain the fire. The fire was started during the prohibited period and was less than two metres from flammable materials.  The case was heard in the Ontario Court of Justice, Minden, September 6, 2007.  You must not leave a fire unattended and must make sure it is completely extinguished before leaving. Anyone found responsible for causing a forest fire can be ordered to pay the costs of extinguishing the fire.   and also    SUDBURY — Two Barrie area men were fined $1,000 each for causing a fire that burned 590 hectares of Crown land in Halfway Lake Provincial Park and along Highway 144 on the May long weekend. The cost of fighting the fire, named Sudbury 46, is estimated in excess of $1.1 million.  The two men plead guilty and were fined $1,000 each for failing to extinguish a campfire before leaving their site. The men were fined an additional $200 each for littering in a provincial park and for having a campfire in an area not designated for a campfire. The men were placed on probation for two years and must complete 40 hours of community service at Halfway Lake Provincial Park.  The court was told that on May 19, 2007, the men were camping on an island in the southern portion of Halfway Lake Provincial Park. Before leaving the park two days later the pair attempted to extinguish their campfire with water and dirt.  Sudbury 46 was reported on May 23, 2007 and was aggressively attacked by water bombers. The size of the fire forced the evacuation of several hundred people from homes and camps on Lake Onaping. Halfway Lake Provincial Park was evacuated and closed for two weeks. On May 24, 2007 further investigation found the two men that caused the fire.  The case was heard in the Ontario Court of Justice, Sudbury, on August 14, 2007.  The ministry reminds the public that protecting our forests from fires requires caution and extreme care. Campers should never leave fires unattended and must ensure that they are completely extinguished before leaving. The public may be required to pay the government for the costs of putting out a fire that they caused.  these are just two from mnr website"
764018,lew,2013-01-31 10:12:00,12766,"The $5400 fine levied against the fisherman for getting turned around in the fog is a discusting, pathetic money grab and whoever came up with it should be ashamed of himself.  As for volunteer firemen being paid, my brother used to be a volunteer in Scugog Township 25 odd years ago and and if I remember correctly, received around $3000 per year, but I may be wrong on the amount."
764019,Rich,2013-01-31 10:46:00,3927,So basically just dont leave your house or you owe the government money then. Oh and don't stay in your house either.

I do believe we need a system to warn fisherman of ice conditions and if they do not yield then perhaps a fine.  This bill seems crazy steep!"

764026,Garnet,2013-01-31 12:17:00,2056,In the news report 15 firefighters stood around well a few did the rescue. Should victums pay for firefighter training.

764036,Rustic-Fisher,2013-01-31 13:40:00,826, I would'nt believe everything you hear on the news LOL And victims / residents already do pay for training of firefighters.  That's why you pay taxes!!

764038,Rich,2013-01-31 14:13:00,3927,"So can I pay a premium rate for better rescue services?  This is somewhat similar to the privatization of emergency services. Only instead of a company making the money, the government is."
764041,Garnet,2013-01-31 14:42:00,2056,So why are they paying twice
764052,snackpack5150,2013-01-31 15:09:00,79,"So the question posed ""this would make people think twice about calling emergency services when they're in trouble"".  How about thinking about what youre going to do  prior to heading out.  Would you launch your boat in a lighting and thunderstorm."
764053,strik,2013-01-31 15:22:00,175,Would you drive your car through a stop  sign ??? NO  but lots do  Bottom line people make stupid decisions  everyday.  What common sense to  us is not common  to others
764055,fishnsled,2013-01-31 15:23:00,3520," That would be the creative politicians that were elected trying to find other ways to make the budget and give themselves a raise.    Yep, pretty much every year there is someone that goes through around the pressure cracks.  All of this is just coming down to votes I would bet.  A few people upset with these rescues and don't want their tax dollars used for it.  See what happens when they get a bill for a car accident and clean up or something else.  There is a lot of grey area that they want to add some colour to here and set the precedent for future costs.  Just another tax grab on top of the taxes we pay for these things already.  Should there be a fine?  Perhaps.  Paying the total bill, I don't think so."
764061,johnnyb,2013-01-31 15:40:00,3413,"I really think I would think twice before calling 911 in light of this.  No matter what the temperature or conditions, I feel I would be branded as careless and negligent, and that I should have known better.  I wonder how many other people were on the ice that night, when Neil R. got disoriented?  I would be willing to bet he wasn't the only one out there. I wonder why so many firefighters were sent, when he was already on shore?  Was it poor communication with the dispatcher?  Were they being extra cautious?  Could be a good reason....but I still wonder why so many personnel got sent for a guy who was lost in the fog, and already on shore.  How come 26 fishermen that got rescued by air boats and helicopters (last spring) paid $200 each?  200 x 26 = $5200.  Sounds like a pretty good deal for all that highpowered equipment compared to what Neil got.  If he was out there hopping pressure cracks....if he was the only person who ventured on the ice that day....if he drove a vehicle out....then ok....I would be saying he had it coming.  But he went out, and came back, and the ice was fine.  He got lost in the fog, and wandered into a marshy area....marshy areas have bad ice even when the rest of the lake is good.  He called emergency services, and they did their job.  They did what the township pays for them to do."
764075,jimmer,2013-01-31 16:42:00,2730,"Isn't this why we have fire, ems and rescue services? They are covered by our taxes already. Yes, it was probably a bad decision to go out on the ice that day, a worst decision was to walk close to bullrushes, where the ice is rarely stable. Are they going to charge a 7 year-old after being rescued out of a river after he slipped on some ice and went in? I doubt it. So why are they trying to set an example with this guy? Most people will make somekind of mistake in their life, that's why we have those services and pay a large amount of taxes to support them. Just a few thoughts."
764076,lew,2013-01-31 16:47:00,12766, My sentiments exactly.
764080,pylon,2013-01-31 17:13:00,68,I don't know what the fire services are at scugog but a volunteer department is just that working men/ women that work. They get paid per call usually by the insurance companies ( fire ) municipalities can't pay for full timers
764082,Rich Nelson,2013-01-31 17:26:00,332,"My guess is that they are making an example out of him. Several guys saying they would think twice about calling 911 now ( which I dont believe for a second) Maybe it will make people think twice about makin stupid decisions like going out on unsafe ice. Then again, you cant fix stupid...."

However I can see both sides of the equation and after 6 pages I am still torn on this topic."

763951,Twocoda,2013-01-31 00:39:00,4130,I think everyone here is missing the point ....We pay for firefighters and cops through our tax dollars....whether they are sitting on their asses or being dropped from a helicopter to save a person stuck on the side of a cliff..... my point is..... Cops and Firemen are paid well to do what they are supposed to do.....if they dont like it because of a degree of safety....Quit....The general public isnt going to change from its percentage of stupidity....for everyone that manages to win the Darwin award....there is another born to succeed him....If they dont want to be subjected to high occupational hazzards...get a different job  If im going ice fishing .....I know...they have already been paid to save my ass if something go wrong....  For the record.....I dont ice fish.....but i do LOTS of other stuff.....so for all the people that have never used the services for rescue...shouldnt they get a tax break????
763953,Rustic-Fisher,2013-01-31 00:40:00,826,"Or someone has the big one dragging your gear up that hellish slope at Bear Point, and a truck with four firefighters, and the another truck( EMS) staffed with advanced ALS medics ( 2) tries to save their life. Don't forget Police, they,ll also be helping, securing your valuables, gathering info in order to contact a relative or friend, and helping mitigate traffic to get someone outta there quick. I'd pay for that! And you do it's built into your taxes.  "
763957,Rustic-Fisher,2013-01-31 00:49:00,826,"  Thanks, guys like you are guaranteed job security for emergency services LOL!!  What you have to realize is that in any scenario you put the public at risk. Example, guys out fishing 75 yards from  you go threw the ice, you likely just don't watch, human nature ( most times) says you try and help. The result is joe public also risking his life to help someone in distress.  Emergency services aren't the only one risking their lives. Look at the big picture.  "
763961,LeXXington,2013-01-31 01:12:00,1928,"So if the rescue team and all there buddies arrive but you don't need them. Do you get to tell them, to go home. Sort of like a tow truck drive cruising around to make some cash..  Terry has all the arguments.. Next time they announce a major snow storm and dangerousness road conditions.  The 1000000 drivers here in the GTA that get in accidents should be billed for every cop, fire truck , and emergency responder that shows up bet this nonsense would stop the first day.  "
763966,jedimaster,2013-01-31 01:46:00,3472,Don't forget the last time I checked you have to pay for other emergency services like taking an ambulance. 45 dollars last time I checked if its an emergency and 250 if its not. I mean if I drop of a heart attack and get a ride in an ambulance and need to pay than why shouldn't a person pay if they are ice fishing? I am not sure what the deal is with fire rescue.
763968,Terry,2013-01-31 01:48:00,14456,they charge 50 bucks for the ambulance etc a far cry from 5000.00 they want to charge icefishermen   next
763969,jedimaster,2013-01-31 01:54:00,3472,"That's just for ambulance... for fire you are responsible for the full cost. Its up to the municipality as to what the charges are.  http://www.mississauga.ca/file/COM/firefees2011.pdf  The caveat that people don't know is that in a car accident your car insurance company gets the bill, if its on your property fire response is covered under you house insurance afaik. So when you are out on your own off your property you are fair game for getting a bill.  That's why they have emergency response insurance for back country skiers. Its like 3 dollars a day. OFAH should really jump on this as an opportunity."
763973,bigugli,2013-01-31 02:10:00,6138,"I can see the fine for  going out on poor ice and being rescued.  The amount, however, is absurd. Heck, I've paid out for some 40+ ambulance trips over the past 3 years for family members. It hurts the pocket, but it does not stop me from calling 911.  Emergency services have evolved considerably from 30-40 years back. Back then, community members were called upon to search for missing boaters and ice travellers. Methods and equipment are far more advanced. Due to liability concerns, they do not call on local volunteers. Risks still exist. I get a knot in my stomach every time my nephew gets called out on marine rescue, and it does burn bad when I hear he is risking his life for someone who disregarded weather and condition warnings."
763974,Terry,2013-01-31 02:10:00,14456,then I guess we need on ice rescue insurance so we don't get billed
763976,Twocoda,2013-01-31 02:11:00,4130, Ice fishing safety course.....100 bucks will get you a license that says you know better...when in doubt...dont go out unless you have ice fishing insurance
763977,jedimaster,2013-01-31 02:12:00,3472,"Here is an example of a skiers insurance company, I got it one time when I was snowboarding heli style...   The operators tell you about it. I think that is what its going to come down to in the end. That ice fisherman will need to carry ice fishing rescue insurance. That's with I mention ofah. heck it may even be part of the ofah insurance policy as it is.  http://www.holidayguard.com/Ski-Insurance.html"
763978,jedimaster,2013-01-31 02:15:00,3472,"However I totally agree that the bill this guy got is WAY WAY WAY overboard. I mean why did port perry send out every friggin firetruck for a guy with a busted up leg and soaking wet on shore? That part makes no sense to me.  Getting a bill imo is justified... the amount however is way way high imo  I mean I would be showing up in court with words like ""Gross Negligence"" and ""Misappropriate of Funds""  The base argument here is should an ice fisherman pay for rescue. I ice fish regularly and I have to admit I think I probably should pay, but I think there should be the option for insurance coverage or the option to do community service in lieu of payment."
763981,Rich,2013-01-31 02:29:00,3927,Yes. There is no difference and that would be just as wrong.
763983,nlpaintballer,2013-01-31 02:30:00,122,"Table an idiot law. If you are rescued and the responders think you deserve it, charge you with endangering lives due to idiocy. You get your say in court, fines, community service, or you might be found innocent.  IMHO +13 for 2 days with already crap ice means don't go out there. I'm sure the news of people going thru the ice on simcoe the night before was everywhere, but he still went.  99 percent of us would not go out on that night."
763984,Rich,2013-01-31 02:31:00,3927,Does the OFAH Angler Insurance cover this?
763988,jedimaster,2013-01-31 02:38:00,3472,"Not sure, but here is the details from there website... I think a call to ofah is in order.

764002,Joey,2013-01-31 03:40:00,9122,"So what if someone had seen him fall through the ice and THEY called 911, and then all those fire trucks and rescue people showed up and when they got there, just like this time, he was already on shore!  Would he be liable for the fine or would the innocent, worried bystander be liable because they called 911???  Something to ponder!"
763869,kemper,2013-01-30 21:05:00,2232, Is there a secondary market for these cards to be traded? I see an investment opportunity...
763870,Terry,2013-01-30 21:07:00,14456,"they can tattoo a big L on your forehead to know when  you have used your ""rescue one time card"""
763875,davey buoy,2013-01-30 21:16:00,5505,"Just a idea,so the idiots pay!,Odds are you and I and most people would never use that card. No trading allowed.lol."
763876,dhickey,2013-01-30 21:18:00,1038,Law is based on common sence. Is there laws for fishing YES Are there laws for hunting.Yes Are there laws for Ice fishing.yes. Should theese laws be transferable to include all other sports or activities that include a resonable onus on the participant to exercice resonable judgment. ABSOLUTELY.
763878,Rich Nelson,2013-01-30 21:25:00,332," Smoking in bed is not stupidity, anymore then ice fishing is stupidity. If the ones doing the smoking are negligent morons, then different story. Same as if the ones ice fishing in bad conditions are negligent morons..."
763883,Terry,2013-01-30 21:32:00,14456,"as is people driving in thick fog, or icy road conditions skateboarding down steep slopes and every other dangerous activity that you can make a choice to do or not to do"
763884,tightline,2013-01-30 21:34:00,322,"Am I wrong in thinking that Neil was rescued from the shoreline?  I recall reading a story about a firefighter rescuing a dog off a cliff and in turn having to call to be rescued?  http://toronto.ctvnews.ca/man-and-dog-rescued-from-cliff-at-scarborough-bluffs-1.908991 I wonder what his bill was...Seems outrageous to me!  I'd gladly throw 5 in the hat if anyone was taking up donations for this poor guy.  Sounds like he devoted allot of his life molding young lives, and I'm sure makes more reasonable choices then most do."
763886,Christopheraaron,2013-01-30 21:37:00,3525,"That's what I was saying, there was no danger to rescuers at any time. All that was needed was medical attention."
763887,Terry,2013-01-30 21:38:00,14456,"people don't want to know the facts..not when you can call him a moron and proudly state your better then that  if you can't put someone down to build up your own ego, then whats the point of the interweb"
763888,davey buoy,2013-01-30 21:39:00,5505,"Remember,now if we need a ambulance to come to our homes,and take us to the hospital.Not long after a bill comes in the mail.Heard that quite a few times.In the area of $50 bucks or so. The user fees are somewhat already in effect.Now that is a legitimet emergency.Out of our control,and we still pay."
763889,mike rousseau,2013-01-30 21:42:00,4661,"Sooo  If its -30 and I go through a patch of thin ice am I an idiot that should pay....?????  Everyone is calling all these people stupid for going out in warm conditions... What about those who go on THIN ice when its cold?  Or just hit  a thin patch during ""optimal"" conditions...?"
763894,tightline,2013-01-30 21:45:00,322,We just got one 45$ bucks...because my 7 month pregnant girlfriend was having severe pain and I couldn't get her off the back steps.   They responded 15 mins later...I live in a town of 2000 people...sat at the end of the driveway after loading her up for 10 mins...the hospital is literally a 1 min drive from my house...I beat them there.
763899,dhickey,2013-01-30 21:55:00,1038,If you can get this than Im shure yiu can wrap your head around the concept of common scence
763903,Terry,2013-01-30 22:14:00,14456,"so you don't see sidewalks near roads..you never hear of someone falling on a sidewalk and ending up on the road..there are cars and trucks on the road that can hit that person that falls on icy sidewalks..well is it not stupid to walk on slippy sidewalks..they should be charged hell fined , even if it's their estate, because they are dead from the truck that hit them  and I will bet you any amount of money that more people have died from falling on sidewalks the icefishing..and I will bet there has been more rescues of falls then icefishing... and again my point charge/ fine every time firemen leave the station or not at all do single out fishermen"
763906,Rustic-Fisher,2013-01-30 22:23:00,826," Google how many Cops or firefighters are killed each year Just responding to calls be it water rescue, assaults, vechicle accidents etc..  "
763908,misfish,2013-01-30 22:30:00,29133,"Tell ya whats scares me now. We have had this mild weather for 2 days up here. (snow gone over night)I seen a guy spud two holes that had to be 1.5x1.5 ft on sunday.Both Terry and I couldnt believe it. We had a good 6-7 inches of black ice.  Im sure they are now 2x2 ft. Now we have this snow sqaul coming for the next three days with minus temps . You can bet,those holes are not going to froze over . So,I walk out on a good 6+ inches of black ice,that I know is there,and find one of these holes falling in. Break a leg.  This is my fault?  I can see the point of a gps,but come on,some can,and cannot afford one.  I have been caught out in a fog on the ice. We stood pat,drilled holes and waited it out."
763911,davey buoy,2013-01-30 22:42:00,5505,"When I had the house and hut at Big Bay, Point that was a common occurence.Chainsawing a hole was the thing to do.As Brian said,if you move your hut and don't mark it,or some daily guys didn't use augers only chainsaws.I'm glad I didn't take a wrong step.Another catch 22,who pays the rescue,hopefully not I. I think ice will continue to be a grey area as it can be here today,and gone tomorrow ,thick today,thin tomorrow etc. Common sense is all we have."

763831,Terry,2013-01-30 20:01:00,14456,"thanks for suggesting for fees for icefishermen , I hope they charge access fees at your favorite lake  and most of your examples people were breaking the law..the icefishermen did not...they were just stupid if you are stupid and drive in bad conditions do they charge for the rescue...no  if you kid climbs up a tree and can't get down , do they charge or fine...no  if you fall asleep with a smoke and burn your house down do they charge or fine ..no   if every single person gets charge for any rescue anywhere, then fine otherwise, quit making fishermen a cashcow"
763834,dhickey,2013-01-30 20:13:00,1038,Terry its about gross neglegence caused by lack of common sence. That is why laws are put in place.
763836,Rich Nelson,2013-01-30 20:18:00,332,
763837,kemper,2013-01-30 20:18:00,2232," According to Jay M. Feinman of the Rutgers University School of Law, ""The core idea of negligence is that people should exercise reasonable care when they act by taking account of the potential harm that they might foreseeably cause harm to other people.""  Reasonable care to me would seem NOT to include being on crappy ice after two days of +13 temperatures...but maybe I'm being unreasonable."
763841,Terry,2013-01-30 20:23:00,14456,how many people drive their cars in nasty fog...when you can't see the car in front of you..you should stay home or get off the road till it clears up one could argue it is gross negligence caused by lack of common sense. if you cause an accident or get into an accident under those conditions  so by you logic everyone on the road should be charged and anyone who needs rescuing should pay the price...........I see no less cars vgoing to work on foggy days....so it seems some people only see icefishermen as doing stupid things.....one price for all or no price for anyone
763842,Rich Nelson,2013-01-30 20:24:00,332,
763843,ketchenany,2013-01-30 20:28:00,3229,"OSHAWA, Ont. - A southern Ontario man says he will fight the $5,400 bill he got from a fire department for rescuing him after he went through the ice while fishing. Neil Robbescheuten, 62, was ice fishing on Lake Scugog earlier this month when a dense fog rolled in and he became disoriented trying to find his way back to the shore. The Oshawa man says he went through the ice in a marshy area near some bullrushes so he was able to pull himself out onto a tree stump while he called 911 and three firetrucks responded to rescue him. He later received the invoice of $5,392.78 for the rescue and says he plans to fight it because he worries it will make people think twice about calling emergency services when they're in trouble. Scugog Fire Chief Richard Miller says while this is the first such invoice there, the township north of Oshawa has had the ability to issue them for years. Miller says the temperature was warm and rainy that weekend and the local conservation authorities had issued warnings urging people to stay away from bodies of water."
763844,kemper,2013-01-30 20:30:00,2232," I'm just looking at the other side of the argument, that's all.  I choose to stay off thin ice, under warm conditions because I realize that there is a much higher risk of going through.  Look at it this way - you're having your morning coffee at the cottage looking out over the lake in January when its +12C and some moron drives his truck out without checking and goes through the 4 inches of crap ice. Now it's up to you to risk your own life to pull pinhead out of the drink.  Is the guy negligent or unlucky?  Personally I would be pissed that I had to endanger my life because of someone else's stupidity."
763847,dhickey,2013-01-30 20:33:00,1038,If you intentionaly put yourself or others then yes it is negligence coupled with a gross lack of common scence. Accidents do happen. But entering into the rhelm of extreem sports you take the responsibilty upon yuorself to use propper judgment therfore accept resonsabilty for you own errors.
763848,ccmtcanada,2013-01-30 20:33:00,7971," No, I'm not serious...I wrote that to show how idiotic it would be to try and go after this as there will be many arguements on both sides...that is ""where will it end?"".  No need to be embarrassed as I was trying to prove a point."
763849,Rich Nelson,2013-01-30 20:34:00,332,"And because they are paid to train and rescue, there shouldnt be a fine for putting them in danger? Your third comment is apples and oranges. If you had said that some guys decided to climb down the niagara gorge, away from public paths, and got stuck and needed rescue... Then yes, they would deserve a fine as well. They didnt do anything illegal, but stupidity put others at risk. Pretty clear to me"
763852,Rich Nelson,2013-01-30 20:35:00,332,
763853,Terry,2013-01-30 20:36:00,14456,"I never said they were not stupid, and I hope I make better choices but every single rescue of any type puts the firemen at risk , fires are about the most dangerous rescues going and water/ ice rescues in ontario are among the safest rescues going..and if you look at how few rescuers have died in  water/ ice rescues in ontario, they stats will prove me right"
763855,kemper,2013-01-30 20:38:00,2232," Really?  What are the odds the rescuers show up in time unless you're on a Lake close to a major population?  I think most of us would probably do our best to get someone out of the drink, even if we felt like drowning the guy anyway...  Not that any of us sitting around our keyboards are solving the problem, I just think some opinions might change if it was your own life that was at  risk because of someone else's stupidity (and yes, negligence as well)."
763856,kemper,2013-01-30 20:40:00,2232,I think you missed the excitement about this in another thread
763858,kemper,2013-01-30 20:44:00,2232," Ice rescue innovation - tie a rope to a potato, load potato into potato launcher, launch potato towards moron that went through thin ice, retrieve moron using rope.  Problem solved?"
763859,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-30 20:46:00,10439, And pour myself another coffee.  As the saying goes: You can't fix stupid!!
763861,kemper,2013-01-30 20:50:00,2232,"So what I'm getting is there is no way you would risk your own life to rescue a Darwin candidate from cold water, but they shouldn't get the bill for their negligence when the professionals arrive to risk their lives?  Hopefully softwater season comes soon"
763862,chessy,2013-01-30 20:51:00,610,not a big ice fisherman but after yesterday when guys spaded a hole not less than 1 feet from the edge of open water and less than 5 min later had to run and get his stuff and then run back and jump over open water because the piece of ice let go. this just cements the idea if you and dumb enough to play a dangerous  game then you have to pay .
763863,kemper,2013-01-30 20:53:00,2232, Sometimes I wonder if we should just let people like that float away for a while...
763864,dhickey,2013-01-30 20:53:00,1038, Doesnt matter the plain fact is there is no excuse for STUPIDITY!
763865,Terry,2013-01-30 20:56:00,14456,not a big walker but after yesterday when guys were walking down icy sidewalks and less than 5 min later he fell 3 times and then run back and jump icy walkways because the piece of ice let go. this just cements the idea if you are  dumb enough to play a dangerous  game then you have to pay .
763866,kemper,2013-01-30 21:01:00,2232," I'm not following the parallel between icy walkways where you might break an ankle, to open water in the winter where you might die."
763868,davey buoy,2013-01-30 21:04:00,5505,"What about a ""rescue one time card"",after that you pay the piper?."
763769,Oggie,2013-01-30 15:55:00,588,"I'd call 911 but then I want to ""negotiate"" the level of the response. Instead of 15 fire fighters  I think 4 can handle it and don't send 4 trucks send 2 that's within my budget! I'm not hurt badly so I decline the EMS and there's nothing criminal so no need for OPP.  Will that reduce my bill?   This guy doesn't even get a day in court! Just a bill he has to pay. Why not let the OPP determine if he is responsible. If he is responsible then charge him and he can plead his case in front of a JP. Why does the municipality get to be the judge and jury? Doesn't seem like due process to me.  Dan O."
763774,adempsey,2013-01-30 16:02:00,1498,"The whole idea that they are allowed to pick and choose ""when"" they should rescue someone is abhorrent.   Totally unacceptable.  People are stupid and do stupid things all the time.   Those mistakes put rescue workers in peril every single day.  This isn't a new thing nor will it ever change.   Centering out one risky activity from the other is just unethical.  I love this quote from that article:     Just unbelievable."
763777,Hoppy,2013-01-30 16:15:00,95,what the hell are you talking about? I have been ice fishing 40 years and never heard of one fireman or cop death responding to a ice rescue.  Hoppy
763781,misfish,2013-01-30 16:43:00,29133," No Rich,you be dead."
763782,Terry,2013-01-30 16:45:00,14456,I can't say anything to a few of you that will not get me in mod trouble....  an ice rescue is no different then a bad weather car accident .... I hope you do something stupid and they make you pay through the nose so I can laugh at you and call you stupid and get to say you got what you deserved
763783,jedimaster,2013-01-30 16:51:00,3472,"Honestly, I am a little bit torn on this issue. People should be held accountable for there own mistakes. However I don't think it should be in the form of a fine. I would think some sort of community service would be sufficient. Perhaps like a Fine or X hours of community service.  Perhaps a list of ""Extreme Danger activities"", I don't really know. However people need to be made aware of the costs as well. You can't just go and render services without letting the person know what it will cost.  EG...Help I am stuck on an Ice Flow.. We will come and get you and because there was public warnings made about the ice in that area being very unsafe you wil be billed X dollars or X number of community service hours...  I really don't know, but to be honest I think alot of people do some things and put themselves and other at risk needlessly and they should be held liable. I just really don't know how to apply that. Its just a feeling I personally have."
763785,jedimaster,2013-01-30 16:57:00,3472,"And further, perhaps the total amount of rescue dollars for stupidity is insignificant in the end. Does anyone have any budgetary stats on the issue? If we are talking about 1 percent of the budget goes to rescuing exteeme danger activities etc... than  perhaps its just not worth it to go after someone for rescues."
763790,ccmtcanada,2013-01-30 17:41:00,7971,"Going back to the original question....  ""Would you call 911?""  No matter what the circumstances....  My stupidity or not...  If I thought my life was in danger I would definitely call 911.  What's a life worth these days anyways?  I'm not saying I agree with charging...actually in most cases I'd say it's not warranted.  If that's the law in an area (or by-law) then you have to abide by it....or do something to change it."
763791,Guest,2013-01-30 17:50:00,0,"Totally agree.  I work in the health care field and last week I had to send someone out by ambulance cause they became lethargic.  I was expecting a couple of paramedics.  They came and then 6 firefighters.  I couldnt believe it.  They needed all these guys for a 120lbs person.  I know the firefighters are first responders, but come on.  It probably cost a fortune to drive there vehicle from there station to the place I needed them.  Its best to have them on standbye just in case a more serious accident happens."
763793,moxie,2013-01-30 18:01:00,1566,Totally agree. Case by case basis as accidents do happen.
763795,ccmtcanada,2013-01-30 18:05:00,7971,"This is a very slippery slope indeed...  Take this scenario.  I'm walking along the edge of a lake.  I see someone fall through the ice.  I call 9-1-1.  Thankfully the person survives and gets a bill.  That person says ""I didn't call, I'm not paying"".  Do they charge me for making the call?"
763797,BillM,2013-01-30 18:13:00,17367,"Cliff, should have just kept walking and not got involved, lol.  Sadly, this is what's going to happen.  Someone is not going to call 911 because they are worried about a bill and won't make it..  Then the crap will hit the fan."
763798,jedimaster,2013-01-30 18:14:00,3472,If you are standing on the slippery slope and fall in while making the call I tihnk you get the bill yes.
763799,Oggie,2013-01-30 18:16:00,588,Never thought of that but that is a good point! And if you compromise your safety in an attempt to help the victim at which point you need rescue are you paying as well?? Dan O.
763800,BillM,2013-01-30 18:23:00,17367, I'm pretty sure the two guys that attempted to save the father/son out on Simcoe a few weeks back weren't charged for the rescue.
763802,torco,2013-01-30 18:29:00,656,  I agree you want people to be accountable and to know how much it costs but people make mistakes and do stupid things so how to decide when/who to pay? Its hard to wrap my head around it.  I like the idea of community service or a fine vs. bill for actual cost.
763803,Terry,2013-01-30 18:29:00,14456,you are correct
763806,Terry,2013-01-30 18:41:00,14456,I wonder if it is true some guys are stranded on simcoe out from oro....
763809,SirCranksalot,2013-01-30 18:48:00,3291," You are right about Rich being right!!  The Scugog 'authorities' were quoted in the paper as saying no ice is safe!! So we are always advised to stay off it!! Cars are unsafe, planes are unsafe, even eating is unsafe---you can choke to death on your food. Best not to get out of bed!!!(Ooops--scratch that. More people die in bed than anywhere else)"
763810,kemper,2013-01-30 18:48:00,2232,"He was on unsafe ice, and the public had been warned that area lakes and rivers were NOT safe.  Seems like a no brainer to me, if you need a rescue skiing OOB in BC you pay the bill too.  Scugog ice is sloppy at the best of times around shore because of the heavy weeds.  **I believe this occurred on Jan. 13 correct?  The temperature reached 13 degrees C on both the 12th and 13th, it can't be a ""surprise"" that the ice was bad..."
763821,NAW,2013-01-30 19:28:00,4022,"This has been brought up before.  But if there is money to be made, then people will do anything.  Freelance Rescue workers driving around like tow truck drivers.  Fighting each other to get the opportunity to go rescue someone so they can make some cash."
763825,jedimaster,2013-01-30 19:38:00,3472,"Its a very difficult idea to get your head around having to pay for emergency services, but I truly truly believe that there are instances where people should be held accountable. Sure car accident, held up at gun point, medical condition etc... but some thing you are willingly putting yourself at a much higher risk than normal and as such I think you should pay either by a fine or community service. Perhaps with a sing on your back saying ""I am picking up garbage because I needed rescue while ice fishing in 13 degree weather"" I just really don't know where the lines should be drawn, or even if there should be, its just the feeling I get when things like this happen. You can't necessarily teach someone common sense, but perhaps you and train it like a dog. I dunno, maybe I am just being stupid."
763826,dhickey,2013-01-30 19:47:00,1038,Lets try it thiis way. If you make a judgment call that puts not only you but ohters at risk is that not neglagence? And worthy of a pennalty? Eg. Impaired driving.? Or what about the kid that killed 2 people on HWY  50 last year .(stunt driving)?Charged with manslaughter.  These are extreem examples but still show pour judgment worthy of pennalties.  Now extreem sports. A skier decides to go into an avalanch zone dispite all warnings. should that person be charged with excersizing pour judgement if that person need to be rescude?   YES.  Gilford a couple weeks ago. 3 air boats and it looked like about 30 cival servants responded to some people out on the ice. The ice had just formed and only 3-4 inches before the warm spell started. On the second day of the warm spell they went down. Not only that they had a child with them.  Now do theese 2 examples help put in perspective the importance of common sence?  Chief of police for OPP said that there is nothing they can be charged with except not using common sence(dont quoat me on that) and there is no charge for that.  What???  So if the townships want to make bye-laws in order to recoupe some of the cost then that is a start.  Ive said it before and I will say it again. You should have a seperate licience for ice fishing!  Don.
763827,Rich Nelson,2013-01-30 19:49:00,332,"Rumour has it that there are 5 guys stuck on Simcoe at the moment. If they do get rescued, I hope they get a fine as well... 100% their own fault. Some people will never learn"
763828,Terry,2013-01-30 19:54:00,14456,I already posted that in this thead
763728,Reelaction,2013-01-30 14:30:00,33,"you guys remeber the retired school principal who fell through the ice after being disoriented on Lake Scugog.  Here's what he gets to deal with now.  http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/01/30/stranded_scugog_ice_fisherman_first_to_be_charged_for_fire_department_rescue_539278.html  We can all say what we want about people making poor decissions about unsafe ice conditions. We all have our own level of safety based on our own experiences or observations.  I for one don't think a user fee for 911 services is right. The man's life was in peril. Regardless of how he got there, there was a need for it.  Could the same argument not be made for hundreds of other leisure activities that incorperate some level of risk. From skiing to hiking, swimming or snowmobiles. All of these activities are an unnecessary part of life that incorperate danger.  Will these activities be next on the list for user fees.  "
763729,Rich,2013-01-30 14:33:00,3927,"So basically they're saying if you fall through the ice you deserve to lay there and die because you're stupid for ice fishing no matter what.  If some dude in an outdoor hockey rink went through, the leafs would have a fundraiser.  Stupid Earth."
763736,DoubleDigits,2013-01-30 14:47:00,140,"I can't understand the folks who scream for fines for people who go through the ice. Saving a recreational fisherman from drowning or freezing to death sounds like a good use of tax dollars/government resources to me. And no, I don't actually care if the guy is 'stupid', an 'idiot', or 'crazy'."
763739,torco,2013-01-30 15:01:00,656,"I see pros and cons to both sides...Its nice to try and deter people from doing stupid things.  Full disclaimer, I actually know Neil, he was first person to ever take me ice fishing when I was a kid. He was a very kind man and a good teacher. Obviously made a mistake that day."
763741,Rich,2013-01-30 15:04:00,3927,"As if it would deter anyone from ice fishing. Losing their life wasn't a good enough deterrent, but wow $5000 is steep!"
763742,Rich,2013-01-30 15:06:00,3927,"Lets say a guy has a gun to my head, hostage situation. I call 911, SWAT comes and gets the guy. Do I have to pay a fine for putting the police's lives in danger??"
763744,Rich Nelson,2013-01-30 15:09:00,332," No, they are saying if you unecessarily put the lives of others on the line, then you should have to pay for it.  I agree 100%   How many deaths have there been this year alone because guys are being irresponsible?"
763745,ccmtcanada,2013-01-30 15:10:00,7971," I think the point is that authorities were publicly warning people that the ice was unsafe and not to venture out.  The situation you outline, you had no reasonable knowledge that you'd become a hostage.  Not saying a fine is the right way to go, but the lines can and WILL blur very quickly."
763746,Rich,2013-01-30 15:11:00,3927,And who is the judge of how responsible they were? This guy was a teacher who ice fished there for 30 years. Fog was the issue. I think the lesson to bring a GPS next time is what he needed to learn.
763748,Rich,2013-01-30 15:12:00,3927,"Okay. So if I walked into a gang neighbourhood and started calling people on, I would get and deserve a fine?"
763749,ccmtcanada,2013-01-30 15:14:00,7971," Like I said, the lines blur quickly."
763750,SylvanOwner,2013-01-30 15:19:00,266," Actually the term ""volunteer"" when applied to firefighting is a lot misleading.  Even though they are ""volunteer"" they get paid for the calls they respond to.  In a backwards sort of way this is the only thing that actually makes sense about the bill.  If this had happened somewhere where they had full-time firefighters then no matter what they're doing they are working and being paid, the budget is in place and this incident would represent no additional cost to the municipality other than the fuel required to respond to the call.  The charge for the firetrucks is harder to justify IMHO, the trucks are bought and paid for, even if they get no use whatsoever."
763751,Rich,2013-01-30 15:19:00,3927,"I've said this before but.. if you went by what the authorities call safe ice - the ice would NEVER be safe. They give out the unsafe ice reports to cover their bums. EVERY time somebody goes through the ice, the first thing stated is 'they were warned' .... Well yah when everyday of the year the warning is dont go on the ice - i guess we've all been warned and deserve our fate!"
763752,Skipper D,2013-01-30 15:22:00,1970,"I can't help but look at it this way also , Who was the smart one who decided to send 4 firetrucks and 15 firefighters to pull one man up onto the bank to saftey ??????"
763753,Rich,2013-01-30 15:22:00,3927,.... Who only fell in to his waist... Obviously was still relatively dry if he pulled out his cell to call 911..
763756,BillM,2013-01-30 15:32:00,17367, You'd deserve a Darwin award.
763758,Reelaction,2013-01-30 15:34:00,33,"There are alot of problems with the bill this guy got.  And Rich is right. Who is the authority that called the ice unsafe. All ice is unsafe. Roads are unsafe, schools are unsafe. Safety is a matter of judgement. Judgements based on past history, experience, research and how prepared you are to deal with an emergency.  If this guy is forced to pay the bill, what recreational activity will be next?"
763759,solopaddler,2013-01-30 15:35:00,8605,"No, but you'd get a well deserved beating."
763761,Reelaction,2013-01-30 15:35:00,33,No kidding Skipper. Maybe they should look to that guy to figure out why their firefighting budgets are out of whack
763762,Rich,2013-01-30 15:36:00,3927,"Lol, for sure. But is the stupidity of the event the deciding factor? Like I said, who is the judge? Surely calling people on in a gang neighborhood would be stupid. Is ice fishing in less than optimal conditions just as stupid? If so, why aren't there fines for ALL rescue services?"
763763,Rich,2013-01-30 15:37:00,3927,"Funny enough, you say I'd deserve it, but who would be charged in this crime? Certainly not the guy using words."
763764,Oggie,2013-01-30 15:42:00,588," I'm all for billing the drivers that drive at unsafe speeds when the road conditions are unsafe.  Once the OPP lays a charge at an accident scene then the driver who is convicted (at least this guy gets a court appearance unlike the guy lost on the ice) should pay for the tow trucks, EMS, fire rescue and even the OPP response.   The unsafe driver was warned about the unsafe road conditions and chose to drive at an unsafe speed.  Nail his/her ass with a bill!  REALLY dangerous precedent here guys!  Dan O. "
763765,Christopheraaron,2013-01-30 15:44:00,3525,"I don't see where any rescue team was put in danger. He said that he was on shore when he called, he was already out of the water."
763766,BillM,2013-01-30 15:45:00,17367, I think there's a difference between looking for trouble and accidentally finding it...
763767,Terry,2013-01-30 15:53:00,14456,how do they justify the firefighter wages for someone trapped in a car or a kid that climbs a tree and can't get down or te drunk that falls or the speeder that wipes out hell a false alarm at a school only costs one hundred bucks to the school.......  even a fire how do they justify the firefighter wages?  I see no difference.......
