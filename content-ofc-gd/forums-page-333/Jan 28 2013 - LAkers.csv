763724,Rich,2013-01-30 14:22:00,3927,Nice work! I planned to do the same thing (monday was my bday) but chickened out due to the weather. Kickin' myself for that decision now!
763743,Jds63,2013-01-30 15:07:00,1365,"nice going Steve, just wondering do you bother trying anything else when the swammers are working ? or do you experiment to see if some of your other goto lures will do the trick if the bite is hot ?"
763776,steverowbotham,2013-01-30 16:15:00,1800,"I've tried a hundred different baits out there and the swammer by X-Zone is far and away the most productive bait I've ever used to ice lakers.  That said, I still always have a good selection with me as no one bait will ever be the be all, end all.  On any given day the fish may prefer a different approach and it's always worth experimenting."

763919,castgame,2013-01-30 23:06:00,161,how do you icefish swammers anyway? are you dropshotting them or just bouncing bottom with a jighead?or am i asking the magician to reveal his tricks
