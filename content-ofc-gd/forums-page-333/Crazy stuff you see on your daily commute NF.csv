764602,BillM,2013-02-02 15:45:00,17367,"I commuted from Barrie to Toronto for about 7 years (Now I work mostly from home)..   One thing I noticed (and I think anyone that commutes from here can agree to) is that the craziness  (ie crappy driving) begins from Hwy 9 southbound..  It's like a flick is switched and people have turned their brains off.   You could have a blizzard from Barrie to the city and everything is fine past 88... Once you hit Hwy9 all hell breaks loose, lol!!!  Don't even get me started with the friday night weekend warriors like to clog up the NB 400 during the summer time!"
764612,Cudz,2013-02-02 16:07:00,2652,"Hey Bill, Something has always baffled me on the 400.  I believe there are more accidents between 89 and 88 than any other locations.  Now I can't explain why.  I look at the area and there is nothing really special or odd about it.  A few hills but that is all.  There are so many accidents there it is crazy. It is the highway 400 Bermuda triangle.  Maybe it is at this location that people start falling asleep?  My buddy hit a guard rail there and ripped his running board off his truck when he dozed off. What is your opinion?  What are peoples opinions about this stretch?"
764624,BillM,2013-02-02 16:50:00,17367,"From 88 to 89 you've got a lot of wide open spaces on both sides of the highway.   The wind ices that section of road up like crazy.  I agree with you though, between 88 and 89 is the worst for accidents."
764635,lew,2013-02-02 17:47:00,12766,"My brother was involved in a very bad accident many years ago on the 400 and I think it was in the 89 area. Him and his buds were coming south on 400 after a weekend of snowmobiling and got enveloped in a massive whiteout.  It wasn't visible because of the heavy blowing snow, but just ahead of them a flatbed tractor trailer loaded with lumber had collided with a couple cars and caught fire. From the vehicle my brother was in, they suddenly saw the orange glow ahead and slowed right down but a hiway bus flew past them and crashed into all the other vehicles. Other cars began crashing into the burning wreckage and something like 7 people died with many more injured.  The driver of my brothers car saw the fire in time and drove into the ditch just in time to avoid it. Another car hit the wreckage and caught fire and the driver burned to death about 20' from my brother but there was nothing they could do to help the poor guy.  My brother carried that image with him for the rest of his life."
764637,davey buoy,2013-02-02 17:51:00,5505,"The most road closures as well/detours. I'd say 8 times out of ten it is in that section of highway. The north bound 400 at Dunlop St,has been a bit of a accident area of late."
764640,bigugli,2013-02-02 18:13:00,6138,"Long before all the construction, the old 69 had to be the most dangerous highway.  Stupidest thing I ever saw there was a truck with boat trailer trying to squeeze into the southbound 69. Traffic was stop and go and this fella tried to cross from Oaks into the plugged lane without enough room for truck and boat.. The rig coming northbound hit the boat and trailer and sent it airborne into the opposite ditch. A miracle no one got hurt."
764654,Cudz,2013-02-02 19:51:00,2652,That is a sad story but all too common on that stretch.  The weird part is that these accidents happen in the same spot in the summer too so although snow and ice play a big part there is still the summer accidents that remain a puzzle  The one before the transport truck was a lady who smashed into the dunlop bridge. Unfortunately it was the mother of a boy in my math class.  Sad.
764655,BillM,2013-02-02 19:54:00,17367,People backing up the Dunlop off ramp on the 400NB can get super dangerous...  turn that corner on the 400NB and you see nothing but brake lights..   That's a really bad offramp.
764845,Burtess,2013-02-03 04:53:00,901," Sadly, this is the truth.... all those crash tests are against a stationary object so the force of impact is 2X the crash force of the tested vehicle.  If you hit another vehicle head on, usually the heavier one wins no matter how many air bags blow up around you.  Even if I hit a Smart Car head on with my Cruze, I am going to push that thing back in the opposite direction.  Of course if I head on with a pick-up, I am getting the worst of it.  The strangest thing I think I have seen was up in the Elmira area when I had to stop for a line of turkeys crossing the road, this went of for a couple of minutes as I counted over 40 of them leisurely walking right in front of my car.

764407,Guest,2013-02-01 20:50:00,0,I was driving on the 403 going around 120 and my hood came up on me.  Glad I had my window down cause I stuck my head out of it to stop safely.

764459,Cudz,2013-02-01 23:25:00,2652,That is nuts. I commuted from Barrie to Penetang for 7 years and have seen my share of living and dead animals.  Once I saw a large dead black bear between Orr lake and Waverley.  I saw him alive about a week earlier.  THe pickup had just hit him but I didn't get out of my car to see if he was alive justin case he was just stunned.  Pretty sure he was dead though.
764462,fisherman7,2013-02-01 23:32:00,325,I commute between Markham and Barrie everyday. Lately all I've seen is stupid people going way too fast.  See lots of deer in Markham along the 407 corridor. Saw a meteor cross the 400 last year. That was neat!

764532,John Bacon,2013-02-02 04:41:00,3277," Actually it does.  As per the link you posted, ""The tests, released Wednesday, show how well vehicles stack up against others of similar size and weight.""  In other words, the favourable ratings that the Smart car received only apply if you have a collision with another Smart car; or perhaps a BRP Spider.  They don't apply to Smart car versus F150 crashes.  Here is another quote from the link that you , ""All things being equal in safety, bigger and heavier is always better."""

It's a great little vehicle, the only time he has a hard time with it is in high winds.  His has winter tires and has had no problems in the snow...he's even passed larger vehicles spinning their wheels.  As Bill said it's a very safe vehicle and as for head on collisions, not many people survive those, regardless of the size of the vehicle.  as for strange things, for the most part I just don't notice much anymore, but the other night coming from work I did see a guy driving in the center lane, oblivious to the flashing lights of the cop ahead who had someone pulled over, the tractor trailer beside him wanted to change lanes to make sure the cop had plenty of room...as I drove by him, I realized why,...he had his smart phone out and his head down reading whatever.....too bad the cop was busy....l  Maureen"

These 3 cylinder vehicles were never meant for the highway amd certainly not on a daily basis. Sometimes they are being driven at 120 km/hour!  From a safety perspective, I don't think that the survival rate would be too high at highway speeds. I saw one just today in the winter!  Can you imagine the traction in a snow storm?  What crazy things do you see during the daily commute?"

764349,crappieperchhunter,2013-02-01 15:50:00,2582,When I did the commute from Oshawa to Mississauga my fav part was looking for deer along the 401. There always seemed to be a concentration of them around Lakeridge road on the north side of the 401.  And another spot... Rouge valley I think. It always seemed special seeing them heading into the big city for work.  Now I live and work in Oshawa. But I still look for wildlife when I'm heading to work. Tuesday night on my way home from work at Midnite I actually hit a Possum down near the lake. And I see lots of Coyotes and the odd deer too.

All i saw was the bottom of quad flying at me.  This guy slams on his breaks, peals of in to a field and starts blowing doughnuts!  Must have been his Dad's machine.  Didn't even care that I was there.  Yesterday, I saw a pick up truck slam in to the back of a road sander.  Last summer I had one of the crop watering machines drive it's self on to the road.  My car got a good washing!"

It was winter during a snow storm and I was heading South coming up to the light just South of Dundas and I saw a vehicle in the Northbound curb lane that had spun out. It had it's back end in the ditch with it's front wheels on the shoulder and forward of the wheels was just poking into the curb lane (this was about 100yds North of the last light before Dundas). There are 2 lanes each way so the center lane North was clear (except for snow of course). It was fairly late and there were very few vehicles on the road, but there was one heading North in the curb lane. The ditched vehicle was there for quite a while already and had it's flashers on. Did the Northbound vehicle slow down and change lanes. Of course not!!! They just leaned on their horn for several hundred yards and smacked straight into the stuck car.!!!!!!"
764354,BillM,2013-02-01 16:15:00,17367," Not to be an ass, but the Smart probably has better crash ratings then the car you're driving right now.   And what makes you think these cars shouldn't be driving on the highway or on a daily basis for that matter?    The CDI models are getting 60 MPG US with ease and are pretty bulletproof."

While travelling home he crested a hill only to find Betsy the cow standing in the middle of the road!!! After the collision the van was bent up but drive-able and the cow was on it's back, legs in the air and DOA. When the cops and fame showed up they all had to gang together to drag old Betsy off the road."

So the guy that was cut off does a U turn and chases down the other guy – I caught up to them a few lights down the road – the guy that had been cut off gets out of his truck and goes to confront the guy – well the guy jumped out of his car and he punches the guy right in the face – dropped the pour guy to his knees – gets back in his car and goes through the green light….I was crying I was laughing so hard, the guy finally picked himself off the ground and gets in his truck and drives away – I had to pull over I was laughing so hard.
