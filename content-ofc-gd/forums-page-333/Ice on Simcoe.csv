764029,iFish4real,2013-01-31 13:11:00,386,anybody knows if ice is still good on Simcoe after the rain? tx!!!
764030,BillM,2013-01-31 13:18:00,17367,"Snowy and very windy today.   If anything that rain we got yesterday melted any snow on top and she'll be locked up even tighter...  Although I wouldn't be out there today, it's not very nice out."
764033,iFish4real,2013-01-31 13:26:00,386,I was planning for Saturday Thanks!!!
764035,BillM,2013-01-31 13:39:00,17367, I'll be out there as well..
764048,iFish4real,2013-01-31 15:04:00,386,where abouts ?
764049,BillM,2013-01-31 15:06:00,17367," Lake SImcoe, the frozen part"
764056,misfish,2013-01-31 15:23:00,29133,"  Ya it,s windy as all get out. Not a day to be out there for sure.  Might see ya out there Bill."
764057,Terry,2013-01-31 15:26:00,14456,"I would think the weekend should be safe, if it survives the wind...I  think it will"
764058,BillM,2013-01-31 15:29:00,17367,"Yup, I think there is enough ice out there that the wind today shouldn't affect it at all."
764059,iFish4real,2013-01-31 15:38:00,386,"oh, I would have never thought of that"
764084,kickingfrog,2013-01-31 17:32:00,8333,It sure is windy today. I hope it holds. I havn't been out yet and Saturday might be my day.
764089,Acountdeleted,2013-01-31 18:14:00,2562,Bring cleats. Yesterday just getting from the shack to the bathroom was a trip in itself.
764128,Joey,2013-01-31 19:57:00,9122,I'm hoping to get out there too Saturday.  Hopefully someone can go out and give us an ice report tomorrow
764130,Freshtrax,2013-01-31 20:08:00,2215,Looks like we will all be out on Saturday.   I'll be out off the east side of big bay point.
764136,RickOnt,2013-01-31 20:26:00,669,Did the drive from Gilford to IBP and there is no open water that I could see from shore.  All the water that was on top is froze.  Looks like it started to snow before the water froze and there are small patches of crusty snow but mostly bare ice!  Rick
764137,moxie,2013-01-31 20:26:00,1566,Now why would you go and give up that spot?!?!....hehehe
764150,kickingfrog,2013-01-31 21:15:00,8333,All the water that was on top was blown over to Beverton. Hopefully it went down someone's hole.
