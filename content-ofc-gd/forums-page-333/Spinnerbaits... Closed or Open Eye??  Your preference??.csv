764025,Garnet,2013-01-31 12:14:00,2056,You could be missing a huge amount of fish. Just the blade change speed or stopping is a fish and likely a giant.  Both pike and smallies can hit so light just blows your mind.  I can tie a knots almost as quick as your snap and have way better feel.
764027,lew,2013-01-31 12:21:00,12766,"The only spinnerbaits I use are large, mostly in the 2 3/4 oz. range, and they all have the closed eye."
764032,BillM,2013-01-31 13:22:00,17367, Main line makes a bigger difference in sensitivity then the type of connection on the spinnerbait...   Closed or open with braid you feel pretty much everything.
764043,Garnet,2013-01-31 14:45:00,2056,Have you throwen a spinnerbait or any bait.  Add 1 dead spot and you defeat the rest.
764045,BillM,2013-01-31 14:49:00,17367," No man, I've never used a fishing rod..... ever.  Please explain this 'dead' spot, I'm sure a lot of us would love to hear about it."
764046,Rich,2013-01-31 14:53:00,3927,Definitely true.. when I fish the bay with spinnerbaits the bite is a half second stop of the blades turning..
764387,Garry2Rs,2013-02-01 19:25:00,1425,"I just got here and suspect this has been mentioned in the preceding four pages, but as a reformed tackle maker, here goes... Closed eye Spinnerbaits don't run straight. The reason is that in order to run straight the hook and the blade-arm need to be aligned This isn't possible with a closed eye. If you use leaders/snaps you can keep everything tight with a small piece of surgical tubing, or wrap some thread/braid around the eye, behind your snap and cast away."
764388,fishsevern,2013-02-01 19:29:00,112,I like closed eye but seems every shop I go into only has the open eye so I just buy new skirts for my old ones.
764401,davey buoy,2013-02-01 20:19:00,5505,"Using a o-ring,No difference IMO than a closed loop.Tying or clasp, Personal preference,ok. Give it a try and than see how it works.People give fish to much credit as I learned a while ago.Long as the vibration and spinner is working they'l hit it if they want,I think you'll do all right  .When I buy a spinnerbait,I don't care if it's open or close."
764481,dheitzner,2013-02-02 01:13:00,314, The man knows what he's talking about!!! lol
764521,Dan668,2013-02-02 04:10:00,1120,"Yep. For that one reason, I'll always throw open. I use fluoro and didn't recall the line sliding or getting many tangles. This was with 17lb. Was one of the better lures for me last year"
764546,Rich,2013-02-02 11:29:00,3927,I've had closed eye baits that do run straight though.. they gotta be much heavier than a dinky bass spinnerbait though. Lol
764647,rocket09,2013-02-02 18:48:00,18,"I am with you Rich, the 3/4oz. and heavier closed eye spinnerbaits I make seem to run straight, and work well when burned for smallies on lake st.clair and erie. chris."
763375,singingdog,2013-01-29 11:40:00,1047,"Open, unless I am using a leader. R-bend sbaits vibrate much more than closed-eye sbaits."
763376,MCTFisher9120,2013-01-29 12:21:00,3761,"Open eye, all the good spinnerbaits I use are open eye and never had a problem. Usually ""pike like"" spinnerbaits and bigger baits have the closed eye for leaders and snaps."
763381,Handlebarz,2013-01-29 12:35:00,3790,If I am trying directly to the spinner bait I prefer open.  For any spinner bait I am using a leader on I always use closed loop.
763398,outllaw,2013-01-29 13:59:00,1232,i prefer closed eye and north american made. theres just tooo much chinese crap available.
763401,rocket09,2013-01-29 14:06:00,18,"Hello guys, I have made spinnerbaits for years, and when I sell them at tackle swaps, people buy the closed eye 1/2 oz. models the most. So much so that I have stopped making the open r-bend style. Last year people started asking me for 3/4-1oz. models more, but I would say 1/2 oz. is the most popular size, and white skirts with silver blades is the most asked for colour combo. Thanks chris."
763408,TJQ,2013-01-29 14:45:00,7806,"Awesome,  thanks so much guys.  As I get the ball rolling here, its hugely important to me that I have the right stuff. Mucho appreciated!"
763415,bigmac1984,2013-01-29 15:00:00,193,"I also prefer the closed eye spinnerbaits. Contrary to what some others have said, I find it easier to tune. I've tried the R-bend and found when a big smallie grabbed it, if the line moved much I would lose more fish as a result, but that was just personal observation. I also make my own spinnerbaits and I'd say that closed eye, 1/2 oz is most popular for bass fishing."
763419,mercman,2013-01-29 15:14:00,7054,"Closed eye, simply because i hate haveing to re tie knots all day. I use small crankbait snaps to avoid this.I use a tiny rubber o-ring found in most harware stores, when useing R-Bend spinner baits. Doesnt affect action or scare the fish. I have caught lots useing this method."
763433,BillM,2013-01-29 16:09:00,17367,"I think I'll try some open looped spinnerbaits this year...  Some 17lb Trilene XT I'm sure will work fine for leader material, lol"
763436,mercman,2013-01-29 16:13:00,7054,And here i thought i had outgrown that
763446,BillM,2013-01-29 16:41:00,17367, LOL!!
763500,davey buoy,2013-01-29 19:07:00,5505,"Why the knot tying,I use a clasp and ready to change whenever. I can't see why tying on is better. I spend 8 hours a day most weekends and get lot's of fish.Maybe I'm missing out on something?.I thought giving the bait more space to move would be better?.Is it the stealth look that gives you even more fish?.Like to know the difference?,always learning."
763502,BillM,2013-01-29 19:11:00,17367,More rods = less tying!   This is a great idea....
763504,davey buoy,2013-01-29 19:15:00,5505,"I buy good ones,fishing a lot of Pike(my favorite),after evey toothy critter,I change my knot,worried about fraying mostly.I run 3 bait casters and must change my lures 50 times a day,again depending on bite.Do not want to buy more rods and up to 50 changes a day,don't want to tie a new one on every time I change..Call me lazy lol."
763509,Ainsley,2013-01-29 19:27:00,142,"I always used to use snaps an hated the r-bend spinners.  Now that I tie direct and keep a dedicated s-bait rod all I use is r-bend.  My most used are war eagle, booyah, and Stanley."
763510,TJQ,2013-01-29 19:27:00,7806,  Lazy
763512,davey buoy,2013-01-29 19:35:00,5505,Thanks TJ! lol. Still not convinced tying is better!
763532,Dan668,2013-01-29 21:01:00,1120,1/2-3/4. Always open.
763536,Cudz,2013-01-29 21:17:00,2652,Closed eye.  Can be used more effectively with pike and a leader.  No doubt about.  I actually sold all my R bend spinnerbaits years ago and everything has been replaced with closed eye.
763699,Rich,2013-01-30 12:39:00,3927,"Depends heavily on what I'm fishing for and how big the spinnerbait is.  A spinnerbait 1oz or more I'd prefer a closed wire, to make attaching a leader easier.  Anything less direct tie is better, more vibration and I likely won't be throwing it for toothy critters so the leader connectibility is less important.  My bad, I didn't see the poll featuring sizes. Since all are under 1oz, R-bend for sure."
763702,Rich,2013-01-30 13:00:00,3927,"I'm not saying it's the main reason, but obviously the more links you put between your mainline and lure, the less sensitivity you'll have.."
763716,Garnet,2013-01-30 13:59:00,2056,The r bend came about for manufacturing large quanitys of repeatable spinnerbaits.  All the twisted close eye spinnerbaits need to be hand tune.  Shrink tubing works good on the R bend.  I tie direct for a little better feel.
763760,Dave Bailey,2013-01-30 15:35:00,1641,"I have some open eyes, but I've bent them so that they are effectively closed, then bend the upper shaft back to about the same angle it was originally so that the action is about the same. Well, according to me. I haven't asked the fish yet."
763854,Oggie,2013-01-30 20:38:00,588,"On a different but related note, I like the open bend on a bottom bouncer.  If the worm harness gets hung I find I can reverse the boat and pulling in the opposite direction. This  usually moves the snap swivel off of the bend up to the top of the bouncer. The change in direction of pull often gets your harness free. How would a spinner bait work on a bottom bouncer? Anyone try this for walleye? Dan O."
763872,davey buoy,2013-01-30 21:10:00,5505,"Rich when I'm cranking that spinner bait in,if I can't feel the hit,I don't want it.lol.I feel everything hitting that unless a dinky perch is going after a 1/2oz terminator. or bigger I think the extra sensitivity (if any) is not that much."
763141,TJQ,2013-01-28 15:11:00,7806,More picking of your collective brains...  Couple of questions...  Closed eye or open and what weight??  And why??         
763142,Christopheraaron,2013-01-28 15:17:00,3525,I always prefer closed eye because you can use a leader without it sliding down every cast. And it depends on what I'm fishing for when considering weight.
763144,manitoubass2,2013-01-28 15:20:00,11391,"I prefer closed eye but in all honesty, the majority of my SB's are open eye.  I use 3/8oz and 1/2oz for bass, 3/8oz for walleye"
763149,Roy,2013-01-28 15:24:00,13728,"Closed eye, either coil or twist for the large spinnerbaits. For the bass sizes, I use both."
763151,manjo39,2013-01-28 15:26:00,354, What knot do you use?
763153,BucktownAngler,2013-01-28 15:29:00,582,no brainer....closed eye
763167,Fisher_1,2013-01-28 15:54:00,22,Strike King open eye. usually 1/4 or 3/8oz depending where im fishing.  I also use a Palomer Knot with all my spinnerbaits
763168,jedimaster,2013-01-28 15:56:00,3472,"I never understood why they ever even made open eye spinner baits. I have a number of spinner baits I never use because of that. If I am fishing for bass in pike or musky water I will run a small leader to help avoid the dread ""Plink"" break off's. This eliminates the bulk of my spinner bait collection. Super super annoiying."
763169,ecmilley,2013-01-28 16:03:00,2163,"i prefer closed eye, and almost all my baits are 3/8 oz overall best combo for depth and distance from buning shallow to dropping deep"
763174,BillM,2013-01-28 16:22:00,17367,"I rarely tie spinnerbaits directly, so I prefer a closed eye loop."
763177,misfish,2013-01-28 16:36:00,29133, Learn to tye a knot.LOL  Open all the way for me. Palomar knot and always braid.  3/8 and 1/2.
763178,OhioFisherman,2013-01-28 16:44:00,6623,"Closed eye, but I did use both, generally because of the lack of closed eye ones being available locally. I probably have more 3/8 ounce than any other size, but for me it depends on water depth and what I am attempting to do with it? Heavier works better for slow rolling down deep.  It may have been easier and cheaper for large tackle MFG`s to produce open eye ones?"
763181,Raf,2013-01-28 16:47:00,3495,"closed eye  the baits are stronger because of, the chincy r bends ones get bent all out of shape with one decent fish  i really htink the mfgs just went to r bend to reduce costs"
763186,Lunker777,2013-01-28 17:18:00,866,"98% of my baits are ""R-bend"" which are completely fine for bass/eyes..... once the toothy critters/leaders come into play... closed eye is the only way  3/8 - 3/4 is in my box as we speak..... with a couple of 1oz "" bottom dwellers for those finiky smallies in 100 degree summer heat"
763187,dheitzner,2013-01-28 17:21:00,314,"I am shocked at what I'm reading, as I exclusively throw open eyed spinnerbaits and haven't bought the closed eye ones in years. I throw spinnerbaits an awful lot, and have found that the closed eye baits are way harder to tune than the open eye ones because they are slightly off-set. I always tie direct with a uni-knot and have never had a big problem with bite offs.  If you snug up the knot enough it doesn't slip too bad and if it does, it's easy to just slide it back into position and snug it up again. I generally prefer 1/2oz baits and really like the Stike King KVD models: a bit spendy, but the wire shaft is a little heavier gauge and I really get some great mileage out of them. JMHO, Darcy"
763192,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-28 17:30:00,10439,I do a lot of pike fishing and closed eye is the way to go. I also use 1/2 oz mostly but there are times when lighter ones come in handy.
763216,aplumma,2013-01-28 19:05:00,6896,"Titanium R bends ""seem"" to me at least to have more of a flutter on the drop weight is 3/8 to 1/2 depending on what depth I need to reach.  Art"
763220,solopaddler,2013-01-28 19:12:00,8605, Exactly. For what it's worth a small chunk of tubing pushed down over an open eye spinnerbait will hold your leader in place if need be.
763248,Guest,2013-01-28 21:07:00,0,"Gotta go with closed eye, but I find them really hard to come by.  I go through a bunch in the spring and summer time so to make it easier I purchase the open eye and turn it into a closed eye.  Then I cut a black and red power worm in half and throw that on to."
763269,bushart,2013-01-28 21:58:00,2628,Closed Eye---3/8--1/2 oz depending on the area and conditions  Reason?---just don't like my knot slipping out of bend  I've even taken that tip from KVD and pinched on a rubber core sinker above the head to bulk it up (minus rubber of course)
763273,mike rousseau,2013-01-28 22:10:00,4661, Same
763274,davey buoy,2013-01-28 22:24:00,5505,"I use 3/8 and 1/2 oz spinner baits.Most of the better ones IMO are open. I carry some small o-rings just big enough to fit over the little loop on the open ones.Snap on a black swivel,no sliding down(never)and still manage to get full movement from my spinner bait. If you haven't tried that you'll be impressed. Back to your question TJ.,closed would be preffered but not necessary."
763276,Rich Clemens,2013-01-28 22:54:00,3131,"Closed.  For give open ones, I also use a small O-ring to close the gap."
763281,ehg,2013-01-28 23:15:00,2666,Found generally the more expensive open spinnerbaits are more durable and run more true. The closed ring ones are easier to use with snaps etc...if i am in lure changing mood.
763346,reelinrolly,2013-01-29 02:52:00,281,Closed for sure!!
