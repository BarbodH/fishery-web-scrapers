764332,Live2fish85,2013-02-01 15:07:00,1633,"Just thought I would share some pictures of a few fish I have got so far this year on the river. I love this time of year, as many don't like the cold and stay at home leaving lots of room.            I also landed this big buck, I didn't get any weight or accurate measurements. All I know was it was bigger then any Rainbow I have got trolling and for sure the biggest I have got in the river. A awesome fight and I hope to beat it this year again.    Now to just finish my rod and hopefully have some fish on it by next weekend. Chris "
764335,Christopheraaron,2013-02-01 15:12:00,3525,Wow that's a big fish! Also what kind of a blizzard were you having that everything's white? lol
764337,Andrew Grant,2013-02-01 15:14:00,201,.
764346,mr blizzard,2013-02-01 15:38:00,1589,"Thanks for sharing, great pics, Your right the cold temps give more solitude, fewer crowds"
764372,SirCranksalot,2013-02-01 17:48:00,3291,Darn. I was hoping to see a few crappies laid out on the ice!
764386,fishsevern,2013-02-01 19:22:00,112,What a brute!  Hope you catch him again soon
764396,misfish,2013-02-01 20:02:00,29133,SWEET Chris.  Nice buck.
764415,moxie,2013-02-01 21:33:00,1566,Nice pics.Thanks for sharing Chris.
764437,spincast,2013-02-01 22:31:00,3279,"you are having an awesome season, no doubt it bud. but uh, hummmm, is this a challenge? ""All I know was it was bigger then any Rainbow I have got trolling"" you're on - lets see what we can bag this year down the alley"
764442,Live2fish85,2013-02-01 22:39:00,1633,"Thanks all.  Rick, I am always up to a challenge lol. However I think G will win hands down haha. We should do the challenge on the river and down the alley. Figure theres is something that has to get you out of the hibernation stage haha. I even have extra warm gear you can wear..."
764445,misfish,2013-02-01 22:42:00,29133," Keep the pressure on Chris. It worked for me on another member. .LOL  Rick,get out here."
764450,spincast,2013-02-01 22:54:00,3279,"""However I think G will win hands down"" - oh, that stings - and mostly 'cause your probably right. The Kid's got horseshoes on his hooks. ""theres is something that has to get you out of the hibernation stage "" - lakers in a warm pop up maybe? The way I look at it, only 7 weeks till skinny water off Jordan  (hopefully) Besides, if you turn me into a winter fisher, there will be two more elbows on the riva!"
764453,Live2fish85,2013-02-01 23:00:00,1633,"Well Rick I do have a pop up hut and all the gear for those Lakers, even got a heater that will keep you in a sweater lol.  As for the elbows on the river. That is fine, where I fish there isn't to many elbows.  I won't disagree with you about G having horseshoes on his hooks. He also has the punch to keep reeling in the tanks when you know hes tired lol. I know I was beat with my tank and he has caught bigger haha."
764463,fishindevil,2013-02-01 23:33:00,6254,Awesome winter steel for sure !!!!!
