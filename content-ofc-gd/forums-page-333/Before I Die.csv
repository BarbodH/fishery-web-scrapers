764410,Guest,2013-02-01 20:57:00,0,"This could be a sensitive topic for some people so im sorry if I offended anyone.  The one fish I want to catch before the day comes is gotta be a muskie that I can mount on my wall.  My biggest is 44"", but I think a 50"" would get on there.  A 6+ pound bass is another one that I would like to get.  What about you guys."
764414,Christopheraaron,2013-02-01 21:29:00,3525,"I don't it's that sensitive, for me a 5pb resident brown trout, a 8lb brook trout, 30lb steelhead, 9lb largemouth and a 55"" musky (dream big or go home  )"
764417,bigugli,2013-02-01 21:35:00,6138,You fellas are too young to be thinkin about bucket lists.
764418,Terry,2013-02-01 21:36:00,14456,is there a known expiration date or our we just talking bucket list fish ..
764420,misfish,2013-02-01 21:41:00,29133,Im good for along time. Terry caught his first steel head (with me any ways) Long life to come for us both. 
764425,misfish,2013-02-01 21:52:00,29133," Why dont you have yer steel head in that sig,bud?"
764426,Andrew Grant,2013-02-01 21:56:00,201,You don't have to keep a fish to have it on your wall... Replica mounts look better anyway.   Right now I am looking for that 50 lb Georgian Bay musky. Broke the 40 lb mark when I was 14 lol.
764427,Guest,2013-02-01 22:00:00,0,"Thats the way to go brother.  Take a few pictures and do a few measurements and watch her swim away.  I still have my gramas bass that she got mounted 30 years ago on my wall.lol  I think I was 14 when I caught my first, but it was only 39""."
764429,misfish,2013-02-01 22:04:00,29133,  AMEN
764430,Rich Nelson,2013-02-01 22:05:00,332," I think that answered my question. Ha ha . I apologize if this actually the first time you have heard about replicas, and instantly changed your attitude"

764440,Acountdeleted,2013-02-01 22:33:00,2562," Haha I get em in summer in quinte pretty good. And I will have one before ice out this year. That being said, if I never catch one again until the day I'm called by my ancestry to the afterlife I think I'll be ok......... I think."
764444,Roy,2013-02-01 22:42:00,13728,"Unbelievable.  Good luck on your quest, Mr. Musky."
