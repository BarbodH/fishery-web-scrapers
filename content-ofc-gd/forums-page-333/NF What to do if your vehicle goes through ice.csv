763778,SirCranksalot,2013-01-30 16:20:00,3291," Well, quite often they do! At least about some particular aspect. It's usually gained by actual 'field' experience, being 'on the ground'. Read  a bit of history---the Wright Bro's, Ingstad's discovery of the Viking settlement----and you'll see what I mean."
763784,ecmilley,2013-01-30 16:53:00,2163,never thought about it much wayne always assumed i could pull myself out by the oh poop handles
763813,ch312,2013-01-30 19:02:00,1590," how about we compare apples to apples?  safety warnings and regulations are usually put in place after people have learnt the hard way. the canadian coast guard wants us to wear a PFD whenever we're around water, yet they say not to if you're in an enclosed vehicle.  you're suggesting the canadian and US coast guards don't have any field experience (ie. training and recovering bodies)? sorry, but i'd prefer to side with them rather than what some guy on the internet says. it's common sense really..."
763815,kemper,2013-01-30 19:06:00,2232,"I think the obvious solution to this problem is to strap 300 lifejackets to your truck, and drive it however the hell you want."
763816,Harrison,2013-01-30 19:07:00,2202,"I have two experiences to share about this.  1. Saw a jeep go through on Scugog.  They drove out to the crack and stopped.  It was night and next thing I knew their headlights went down, then straight again.  It took about 15 secs for the jeep doors to get below ice level where they couldn't be opened. Friends of ours were closer to them and grabbed them as they came out.  I would not of wanted my float suit on that is for sure.   Hole in the ice was about the same size as the jeep.  2. Scugog, my buddies truck.  Hit thin ice during a thaw and the back end dropped.  He instantly gunned it and I was out of the truck in 3.6 secs with no suit on.  I JUST made it.... truck leveled out, then went down grill first.  He crawled out the back sliding window.  So for me..... no suit.  Just to add to both stories... it wasn't the normal ice level that stops the doors from opening, but it was the busted ice in both cases.  So that being said, most likely you'll have to jump out the window and not thru an open door."
763823,ch312,2013-01-30 19:37:00,1590, lol!  you could actually be onto something though. i'm thinking some sort of device that could be attached to your ATV or snowmobile to prevent it from sinking would be an excellent idea. move up to the truck size when you have the bugs worked out of the smaller one. inflatable PFD's easily float 250 lbs so it shouldn't be too difficult developing one to float an ATV or sled.  i'd gladly spend a couple hundred $$$ to make sure i don't lose my machine to a watery grave...

763986,jedimaster,2013-01-31 02:34:00,3472,I think I can solve this whole thread with one little picture....  
763994,mukluk,2013-01-31 03:12:00,196,Back in the 70's; north end of Georgina Island on Lake Simcoe.   Three vehicles left the Island road heading out to the huts. First heavy car jumps a crack.....keeps going.   Same for the pickup truck following; jumps the crack ...keeps going. Third one in line an suv jumps the crack; hits the fractured slab of ice on the other side of the crack and sinks to the bottom.  Floating slab of ice rolls over preventing any escape or immediate rescue.      Grandfather and grandson.....gone.
764011,John Bacon,2013-01-31 05:36:00,3277, Not so good if the vehicle goes down nose first or end upside down.

764135,Sinker,2013-01-31 20:22:00,8692,"The trick here is to keep your vehicle ON TOP of the ice.  I'd say 99.9% of vehicles thru the ice, are vehicles driven into pressure cracks. The other 0.01% are driven onto thin ice, where there is current or similar.  I learned how to drive on the ice, long before I was old enough to have a drivers license, and I've been driving on it (when its safe enough) since then. Never had a problem, and don't see any problems coming. Would I suggest driving on the ice? NOPE! Not to anyone.     S."
764163,Big Cliff,2013-01-31 21:43:00,6899,"Well, first of all, when you get older and can't walk out or don't have all the money it takes to buy those fancy sleds and things, sometimes you take a chance you shouldn't have taken.  You'll never know until it is too late that it was the wrong choice and I have never taken my car onto the ice thinking"" I'll probably go through"". I do tend to try to be very careful, I'm not the first to drive out to where I think the ice might not be safe but sometimes you make mistakes. The only people that never make mistakes are the ones that don't do anything.  Are there idiots out there that just go ""what the heck, lets see what happens"". Sure there are but then there are people like me and many friends my age that just want to go fishing. We see that others have gone before us and made it with no problem so we take the chance too,  For now, cut us some slack, try walking a mile in our shoes, then as my dear mother use to say"" go piss up a rope!"""
764209,Musky or Specks,2013-01-31 23:18:00,2710,Well thought I'd post this. First time I went to Temagami to ice fish back in 88. They had ice roads all over just like you see on the show complete with highway size plows keeping the road to the Bear Island reserve building Ice. We saw a car with a 16 foot 4x4 pc of lumber strapped perpendicular to the car across the grill. I asked Paul our host at Temagami Lodge what that was about. He explained that that was to give you a few extra seconds to get out of your vehicle when it went through the ice and that it was common on a lot of the vehicle early in the winter
763612,BillM,2013-01-30 00:45:00,17367, I like milk with my corn flakes
763615,irishfield,2013-01-30 00:50:00,26272,I am serious though... if you wanna give it a try just let me know.. and I'll let you know next time the dunker guy is in the area. You won't get out of that cabin with a float suit on! It's hard enough figuring out where you are and getting out alive in street clothes.
763616,BillM,2013-01-30 00:52:00,17367, I'd definitely be up for that..  Although you really can't compare an airplane cockpit to a fullsized truck with open windows    I can't imagine the plane is easy to get out of in the best of circumstances! lol

763619,irishfield,2013-01-30 00:59:00,26272,Sure you can.. a 3' x 4 door that swings forward.. is a 3' x 4' door that swings forward. The window in the airplane is actually bigger than my trucks. Part of the issue... if you drop through quick is disorientation...  and that's the best part of the dunker machine... it teaches you after a few trips down into the pool how to survive the ordeal.
763620,BillM,2013-01-30 01:01:00,17367," Wayne, I'll be more then happy to give you a few laughs at my expense, lol!         As long as we have a few adult pops after I'm dragged out of the tank by the divers!"
763624,mike rousseau,2013-01-30 01:14:00,4661,That actually sounds like a really useful training tool...  I've always wondered what's worse.... With a suit or without in a vehicle...  If I'm driving out I usually suit up on the ice... But just out of convenience.... 30+ minute drive in a float suit sucks...   I still don't think a life vest/float suit  is buoyant enough to pin me to the roof to the point where I cannot CRAWL out....  I understand you cannot swim down with a vest but I would think i could pull myself down and out...    ....
763628,BillM,2013-01-30 01:21:00,17367," This is my point..   It's not like it's a magnetic suit and you're stuck to the top of the truck cab.     If the window is open, pull yourself through and let the suit do it's job, no need to worry which way is up or down.  I think the thing that kills most people is being disoriented and panicking.   I can't say I know what that's like (and hopefully never will)"
763629,ketchenany,2013-01-30 01:23:00,3229,"Love reading this stuff. I've seen almost any type of vehicle out on Simcoe, including buggy jobs for the desert (him, I'd like to meet again, late 80s). Going as fast as it would go with no care whatsoever.  let's not argue on what is safe and what is not, OR what can be done with what safety equipment.  We are chansing it and should  take outmost care. There is always someone on shore waiting for us.  A fish or a good day out is not worth a life. I have done some stupid things that when I read these posts wish I would have not done.  I love when we get posts on how to repair a leaking rivet in the summer, yet we drive a truck into the unknown in the winter.  Just my two cents. "

763649,chris f.,2013-01-30 02:38:00,95,"       i would say that the fish get a laugh every time someone goes thru... this is my buddy after his latest trip thru, i pulled him out no prob, as the ice was 6 inches thick just steps away from the log. no joke though.. he was freaked out and needed someone there to calm him down to make an easy exit from the water. he still had a chill in his bones 3 days later.  Best piece of advice i can give which shhould be common sense...  is if you do go thru, in a car/truck, quad, sled or just walking.. remain calm, ... think...... and if there is someone there with you to help... do not pull them... let them pull you, my week away could have turned out alot worse if my buddy hadn't taken a second to relax and listen. plus i wear a floater suit lol"

763677,ch312,2013-01-30 05:05:00,1590,"sigh...it's rather frustrating when people think they know more than experts.   Canadian Coast Guard: Open your windows, unlock your doors, and turn on your lights to allow for a quick escape from your vehicle. Some ice-safety experts recommend that you have your seat belt unfastened and your door slightly ajar to speed up an escape. Don't wear a life jacket while riding inside an enclosed vehicle; the extra bulk and flotation could hamper your escape through a window.  Wiki: Aircraft devices for crew and passengers are always inflatable since it may be necessary to swim down and away from a ditched or submerged aircraft: inflated or foam filled devices would significantly impede a person from swimming downward in order to escape a vehicle cabin.  Minnesota DNR: Never wear a life jacket if you are traveling in an enclosed vehicle, however. It could hamper escape in case of a breakthrough.  New York government website: CAUTION: Do NOT wear a flotation device when travelling across the ice in an enclosed vehicle!"
763684,chris f.,2013-01-30 07:16:00,95,"lol... i love it  first off... i don't think anyone here said they know better then anyone else.. reading back, i see a bunch of guys sharing their opinions on a very serious matter. you have pretty much confirmed everyone's posts with info from a bunch of sources. i used to drive in my late father's truck all the time across the bay at my cottage to get in, and to go out fishing before we had a quad. there was also 12-20""+ in those days. as bill said.... i always wear my float suit while on the ice, even if its 12"". but i too have a quad/skidoo for that. i won't take my $42,000 pick-up out on the ice south of north bay these days. but if i did.. my door is open with my left foot on it pushing if fully open...,, again, just an opinion  be safe bouys!!"
763688,chris.brock,2013-01-30 08:16:00,4053," I went for a swim while snowmobiling a few years back, the interesting things I remember were  -the adrenaline of the situation allowed me to function, and not feel the cold -after almost an hour of trying to get the sled hooked to a rope and on the ice, I suddenly felt cold, and like Trent River Fishin said, I didn't feel totally warm until 2 days after"
763690,Guest,2013-01-30 10:23:00,0,So your comparing driving on roads to driving on the ice.  Okay then.  End of discussion for me.lol
763707,woodenboater,2013-01-30 13:31:00,2277,"Also most pfds are not snug fitting (let's be honest) so there will be ride up which could/will affect your mobility as it rides up over your head and the arm holes aren't where they should be. The loose fit and ride up, imo, will definitely hamper any movement to exit in a cramped, disoriented vehicle compartment. As Wayne said earlier, it's the disorientation that will make people panic.  I come from a whitewater canoeing background and have been under a canoe in moving water trying to set up a roll so have a small sense of what disorientation can feel like. Keeping calm should be the first thing to do.  Wanted to note as well that the flotation of a pfd shouldn't be underestimated. it won't be a simple matter to just push down and fight the float. These things are meant to keep users afloat so diving down a few feet will be tougher than one would think, imo. This is from experience wearing a whitewater specific vest in moving and still waters."
763730,porkpie,2013-01-30 14:35:00,2521,"Our family cottage is ice access or trail access only in winter.  We do not drive, even for a week.  We have 2 large toboggans that ride behind the snow machines.  I refuse to take my vehicle on the ice.  I have seen too many mishaps over the years.  I do agree with you on the float suit in cars thing.  If anyone thinks they are getting out with their he man strength in the eventuality that thevehicle went in before they got out a window, is kidding themselves in the extreme.  I have a manual inflator as well, and if was going to ride in a vehicle on ice, that would be my choice!"

763427,jedimaster,2013-01-29 15:32:00,3472,"Tilt the steering wheel up as high as it will go, the less restrictions you have the better. Or of course the most obvious is to NOT drive on the ice with a car."

I have now problems driving on the ice up here in the North. Wouldn't be doing it very often down South though. Was out on Saturday and our ice was clear, black and 44 inches thick!!!"
763484,ch312,2013-01-29 18:30:00,1590," that's IF you can make it out of the vehicle before it's submerged.  i suggest putting on your floater suit in the summer to see just how far down you can swim in a lake or pool while wearing it to understand why it's safer to not wear one. as joey mentioned, the floater suit that would save your life in most situations could actually trap you in a submerged vehicle. although it's highly unlikely, if your vehicle were to go under nose or tail first, or somehow flip, you'd float like a bobber to the floor, windshield, or back window and that's where they'd recover your body.  like i said, it's highly unlikely. just giving you some food for thought..."
763493,BillM,2013-01-29 18:47:00,17367," No you're right, I'd much rather be dragged under in soaking wet street clothes      If you can't pull yourself out of a cab with a float suit on, you shouldn't be out there in the first place."
763497,irishfield,2013-01-29 19:02:00,26272,There's a reason I wear a MANUAL inflate life vest when flying floats in the summer... you can't get out of a submerged aircraft with an inflated life jacket.  Truck window down.. ski jacket on.. running shoes generally.. no seat belt and a speed to suit ice thickness. There's no room for bulky suits if you need to shoot out that drivers window before the doors make it to / through the ice.

763566,irishfield,2013-01-29 22:42:00,26272,"For anyone that thinks they can get out of a submerged.. water FILLED vehicle with a life jacket on... I invite you to prove that you can, next time ""Bry the dunker guy"" comes back to town.  Bryan has a rig that puts you in an airplane cabin that slides you down a slope and it flips upside down when it hits the water (pool) to simulate flipping a float plane. Don't worry... he uses two or three scuba divers to retrieve you before you drown."
763567,Guest,2013-01-29 22:48:00,0,I still dont understand why someone would drive there vehicle on the ice.
763569,irishfield,2013-01-29 22:51:00,26272,Why not Mr. Musky.. it's a way of life for many! Next time I go to the lake.. we'll park in town and go out to camp on sleds. You can spend a day or two shuttling the weeks worth of gear to camp from the highway!
763578,kemper,2013-01-29 23:14:00,2232," Wouldn't catch me on the ice with a vehicle, but I think I'm more cautious on the hard water than most - probably because I don't have a whole lot of ice fishing experience.  Sleds and ATV's sure - but not until the sheet is THICK.  I went through an ice sheet I was standing on while fishing bows in December one time - ice was plenty thick enough to stand on but river ice is never really safe. I knew I was taking a risk being on the shelf, but I also knew that the water was not as deep as my waders where I was standing.  Try getting out of a human sized hole in the ice while you're only just past your waist in the water...I can't imagine trying to crawl my way out of a lake (or car) especially without the added benefit of being waterproof (waders).  I'll continue to play it safe on the hard stuff, if I miss a fish or two there's lots of time left to get them."
763595,BillM,2013-01-30 00:08:00,17367," Who are you again?  You're insane to be out in the middle of a frozen lake without a floater suit on.. Truck, snowmobile, I don't care what it is..    Go ahead and get your Darwin award, it will be well deserved."
763598,Fisherman,2013-01-30 00:23:00,7201,Then you must have some difficulty understanding why some people drive like idiots on dry roads and successfully kill themselves.
