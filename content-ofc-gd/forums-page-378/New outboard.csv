720573,mercman,2012-08-06 16:05:00,7054,"Congrats Mike !!  Enjoy that New Motor smell for a bit, then get out there and break it in"
720576,woodenboater,2012-08-06 16:16:00,2277,"Great news the Honda sold fast and on getting the Yamaha last week.    maybe take some video of it running after the break in period is over, I want to hear how quiet this baby purrs"
720584,mike rousseau,2012-08-06 16:50:00,4661,Heres a pic of the handle.... Everything right where you need it... Can't wait to get my hand on it....   
720585,davey buoy,2012-08-06 17:16:00,5505,Just 3 more sleeps!. Congrats.
720587,smally21,2012-08-06 17:35:00,993,treat yourself and enjoy your fishing!
720757,RangerGuy,2012-08-07 13:07:00,564,"Congradulations man!..you will love that yamaha!  I'm still break'n mine in. Check out this fuel report from my first long weekend with her on the water.  With my old johnson 60hp tiller on a 16' ranger fisherman. I would fill the boat (12 US gallons) and bring 2 more 25 litre cans of fuel with me. We would burn through all of it on a long weekend Saturday till Monday (on monday I would have to choose where I went so I didn't run out)  This weekend I filled the lund up when I got to LakAir 29L to top her up to full. I went home with the gas gauge reading just under 3/4's of a tank used..CRAZY!!!  15 hp larger motor, 2' longer boat and I burned a 1/3 of the gas. NICE!"
720796,Fish4Eyes,2012-08-07 16:36:00,1022," Seeing as you were still breaking it in, I imagine that you were not driving WOT as much? This makes all the difference."
720798,RangerGuy,2012-08-07 16:43:00,564,"Yeh I can't keep her wide open for more than 5 minutes at a time but I averaged around 25-30 mph with 4minuted wide open bursts.  I'm very impressed with the milage, I'm assuming it might even get a little better when it's fully broke in.  If not I'll still be very happy"
721053,mike rousseau,2012-08-08 18:25:00,4661,when they were getting me  a motor from the warehouse they found one with a 1 inch surface scratch on the cowling... so they asked if i wanted that one at $200 less... no brainer.... yuuuuup... ill throw a sticker on that...  than i got an email the next day... he decided to throw in the prop for free...  :thumbsup_anim:    so far the people at clayton marine have been awesome...  one more sleep...lol
721079,Billy Bob,2012-08-08 19:41:00,5865,We like to treat our Canadian friends right.....

721106,Billy Bob,2012-08-08 21:18:00,5865, And that's twice as much as you would ever get for the Leafs.....
721107,misfish,2012-08-08 21:23:00,29133," I would say, it would be an even trade.You might be on the losing end.  Ok,enough Hijacking.LOL"
721108,Joeytier,2012-08-08 21:31:00,3990,"You will love your new Yammy!  Ridiculously good on gas, they are"
