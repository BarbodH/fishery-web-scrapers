719719,davey buoy,2012-08-02 19:39:00,5505," Good for him,I know he was on the fish tv show for a while,but haven't seen him for some time."
719857,GreenCanada,2012-08-03 05:13:00,375,"Yea, I remember seeing him on there a bit as well. I was a pretty big fan of his in his younger years in the NHL and hope his new show succeeds."
719902,Headhunter,2012-08-03 13:27:00,5703,"I bet his knees go out, half way through filming a show! That was a joke by the way! Good luck to Nolan! HH"
719920,craigdritchie,2012-08-03 14:10:00,1586,"I'll be interested to see what he has to offer, But given that the majority of TV fishing shows majorly suck, I'm not getting my hopes up."
719939,DRIFTER_016,2012-08-03 14:55:00,10439, You got that right Craig.  Bring back the Red Fisher show!!! Now that was a show worth watching.
719947,Moosebunk,2012-08-03 15:03:00,3970, Agreed...
720702,chris.brock,2012-08-07 01:56:00,4053,"I thought he looked like he didn't really know what he was doing when he was on fish tv, anybody else get this impression?"
721032,GBW,2012-08-08 16:32:00,8460,if my memmory is correct he did a lot of duck hunting with Mike Ricci over the past few years.  based on what I recall from twitter... I wish him luck.
721104,Broker,2012-08-08 21:11:00,482,"Lucky guy, first he's an NHL star making millions, now an outdoor tv host! Will be interesting how the show turns out"
721122,Rod Caster,2012-08-08 22:30:00,5784,"Saturday and sunday mornings I watch fishing shows regardless of how much the ""suck""... Still beats all the other crap on tv.  I hope he invites Dominic Hasek as a guest, points to a log, casts and pulls in a 5lbs largemouth"
