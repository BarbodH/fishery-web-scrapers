721301,Headhunter,2012-08-09 16:26:00,5703,"Hey guys, My brothers family and mine are leaving on Saturday for a one week trip to ""Jack's Lake"". It is apparently close to Trout Lake... we have not been there before. I am told the lake holds pike, pickereyes and bass, no Lunge. Just wondering if anyone has ever fished the lake and might have some ""local tips"". It's gonna be a family thing, so I have armed myself with tons of jigs, bobbers and nightcrawlers... however, my brother and I like to get for a ""serious fish or two"" during the week... I assuming weedlines, rock piles etc... Anyway, any help is certainly appreciated! Feel free to PM me should you wish. Thanks, HH"
721302,Raf,2012-08-09 16:27:00,3495,Pretty shure Lake X is right around there too might wanna give it a whirl -- fishn's always great there.
721305,Headhunter,2012-08-09 16:33:00,5703,Pretty sure the X is still on the side of my brothers boat Raf... so we should be good for that spot. HH
721306,GBW,2012-08-09 16:36:00,8460,Good luck HH!  Does your brother sing brown eyed girl too?
721307,young_one,2012-08-09 16:42:00,620,"I'll be camping during Labor Day weekend, just a little north from Jack's, at Silent Lake PP. Let me know how the fishing goes for the area!"
721313,Headhunter,2012-08-09 17:14:00,5703,Only after a few cobs of corn!!! HH
721320,fishnsled,2012-08-09 17:31:00,3520,"Never fished it, probably should one of these days. Is your brother making pulled pork? Might be a reason to drag the boat up there this weekend.  Have a great vacation!!"
721321,Moosebunk,2012-08-09 17:33:00,3970,FOGHAT RULES!!!  Deep cabbage weedlines... but I'm just guessing.
