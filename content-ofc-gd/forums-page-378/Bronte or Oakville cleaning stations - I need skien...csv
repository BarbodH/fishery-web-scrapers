721468,GbayGiant,2012-08-10 02:34:00,1780,I think the Bronte river is a cleaning station from what I have read.
721471,kemper,2012-08-10 02:43:00,2232," You'll find both the East and West banks, from the lake to highway 407 and beyond to be excellent cleaning stations."
721483,Snidley,2012-08-10 03:15:00,620,"Gutting and ""cleaning"" salmon and steelhead for their eggs stream side would be illegal, ie. wasting fish and leaving refuse behind on public AND privateproperty. For the Bronte bait angler, situation normal."
