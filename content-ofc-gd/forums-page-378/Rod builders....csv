721255,kemper,2012-08-09 14:49:00,2232,"Hey guys,  I've found myself knee-deep in another build - I keep convincing myself I need more rods somehow...  Building on a spey blank that is burgundy in colour -    I've built almost all my rods on blank or graphite, much easier colours to match up with hardware and thread. I was thinking garnet or a golden colour for the wraps on this one. Any suggestions?  FYI the hardware is entirely a gunmetal/titanium colour.  Cheers,"
721257,Spiel,2012-08-09 15:03:00,9065,"Go garnet Kemper, no CP and perhaps silver metallic trim."
721261,DRIFTER_016,2012-08-09 15:14:00,10439,Don't listen to Spiel!!! Go chartreuse with lavender trim!!!!
721264,Spiel,2012-08-09 15:20:00,9065," Ya, that'll work!"
721274,kemper,2012-08-09 15:40:00,2232," Just the guy I was hoping to hear from - confirmed my first thought Spiel, I think garnet is the answer unless someone can come up with something else I haven't thought of.   On second thought...  I did see a float rod with alternating pink and blue wraps - awful looking thing."
