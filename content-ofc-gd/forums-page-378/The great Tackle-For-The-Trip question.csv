721444,spincast,2012-08-10 00:57:00,3279,"OK - chatting with a OFC friend and  this topic was raised. I just came back from a trip and he is leaving on one in a couple weeks. The topic of the deadly trip tackle purge came up. You know - the one where you look at your  30 - 50 trays of tackle and decide what stays and what HAS to go. And then you get there and you use maybe 3 trays at most in a week. At least that happens to me This question actually extends beyond just idle curiosity. Its my bud's 50th next year and we will be making plans for a fly in, where weight and space will be a premium. So I am intersted in hearing from both the fly-in and the non-flyin crowds. To start things rolling - Me - I never get away with less than three full bags (15 trays) and overflow. Then I bet I use no more than 3 trays if I actually figured it out and more worms than I planned for.   (edited for spelling)"
721452,adempsey,2012-08-10 01:20:00,1498,"My last trip was a fly-in and I worked on reducing my tackle bag from 35+lbs down to <30lbs (was aiming for 25lbs)- the bag holds 7 size 3700 trays.    This was tackle for three guys (my brother and father know not to bring anything but their rod/reels).  I hardly used anything but jigs on that trip.  However, that just happened to be the predominant type of fishing on this lake.  Normally I would have used bottom bouncers with harnesses and cranks a lot more.  When we go back to that lake, my tackle bag will be very light.  On a typical walleye/pike trip, I think three trays would hold more than enough tackle.    In the end it comes down to weight of course, so my aim would be 5-7 lbs and up to 10 lbs maximum.   Ultimately though, it comes down to whether or not you can [or want/need to] pre-fly in the beverages.   That's the killer.  When I drive to a camp, I don't worry as much and bring a ton of crap because ""you never know"" what the hot thing will be.  I am slowly changing that mindset though."
721461,mercman,2012-08-10 01:58:00,7054,"I'm kinda an organization nut.I keep my lures seperated into species categories, so when i am planning a fishing day, i always know what i will be fishing for, and bring the lures necessary for the species. I try to stock tried and true colors,and never buy anything just cause it looks cool.I have one tray of plastic worms/powerbaits, and one tray of tubes/grubs.I reserve one slot in each box to keep the hooks/weights. Its really surprising how little you need to bring if  you decide what you are targeting before you leave, and research the colors and patterns that are successful on the body of water you will be fishing on."
721464,danc,2012-08-10 02:11:00,4677,"I'm flying in next week fishing for Brookies, Walleyes and Lakers. An assorted pack of jigs and a few Rapalas is all that I need."
721465,asdve23rveavwa,2012-08-10 02:13:00,2690,"Happy to inspire you Rick, lol.  To continue what I was saying in our pm's, and to touch on Fishlogics weight point, I have my tackle bag down to 9lbs. Our trip in two weeks isn't a fly in, so I,  could take way more. My point of taking this lesser amount is to force myself to use some baits that I usually don't.  I still have a tray full of jigs to slay the walleye, but, I really cut down on my crankbaits and spoons. Four trays, plus some plastics...that's it, that's all.  Now can I get by with just three rods...."
