720717,Fishing 24/7,2012-08-07 02:42:00,709,  what exacly do you mean ?
720823,thalweg,2012-08-07 18:42:00,112," Those are awesome fish!!  Also seemed like really unually deep Large mouth.  Were they in usual spots that most largie anglers target like pads, logs, slop...or would you say they were in classic small mouth water?  I'm not familiar with Large mouth off shoals or 25 foot rock wall drop offs.  Sounds almost like USA style reservoir fishing.   Anyways beauty pics and report.  Cheers"
720853,Fishing 24/7,2012-08-07 21:03:00,709,  you are right !   this year i had to switch it up.   because of the draught there are no more shallows.  the weeds are toataly different.  logs are comming out of everywhere.  iv been mainly fishing the deep weeds .  find the deepest weed edge or bed of a point. shoal . shore line.  and flip the front of the weeds .  or the holes .  deep HUGE bolders are giving out the FATTIES!  i mean if i were a bass and i coudnt feed in the shallow i would go deep and feed on the crayfish.  all the bass are shitting cray fish by the milliuon.  thats why flipping the deep has been so great.  the smallies are right there with them.  (whitespinnerbait) paul has been catching them on frogs over 25 FOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :worthy:  :worthy:
720937,msp,2012-08-08 01:57:00,1336,"Its a compliment. Its like when the kids say "" SICK "" By far the best bass post in recent years ! A job well done fishig 24/7"
720053,Fishing 24/7,2012-08-03 21:42:00,709,Hey O.F.C   Its been a while i think the last time i posted was about an ice fishing report.  But this time its seriouse buisness.  FAT BASS on the menu!  First day fishing and i land this 5.2 smallie  on a YUM crayfish .    Switch lakes with my cousin and land these two serouse monsters.      My uncle (whitespinnerbait) call me up tell me he found a new lake.  WELL LETS TRY IT MAN!        It was a slay fest !  Now its time to go camping .    Off the dock after sun down.    a 4.10 lbs on a black tube .    This pig had a 1 lbs perch in his belly and still he hits my kinky beaver.      Hitting the main lake shoal will allways produce massive monsters.    This one was caught of a steap rock wall that goes down to 25 FOW . makes for a sweet set hook/fight! ^   This 5.7 largie hit a green titleshot 5/8 with a green YUMcrayfish    ans last bass was 3 days ago.  my new personnal best.            this large mouth bass was 20'' x 18''  making it the BLOBBER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
720056,Roy,2012-08-03 21:53:00,13728,You're impressing the hell outta me Kevin! Damn nice fish and that doesn't even remotely look like Erie or Simcoe!
720058,glen,2012-08-03 21:56:00,2641,Wow Thanks for the pics and report.  You got it good.
720059,bushart,2012-08-03 21:58:00,2628,Man---You ALWAYS Impress!!  Right On
720061,Whitespinnerbait,2012-08-03 22:00:00,2038,        Yup...it's been awhile since i've been to that Lake   
720062,glen,2012-08-03 22:01:00,2641,All bass reports after this will be down hill.  I am not sure but you might need a new transom on your boat.  I bet that is Simcoe. I can tell by how clear the water is.
720063,Terry,2012-08-03 22:05:00,14456,damn
720065,solopaddler,2012-08-03 22:13:00,8605,Amazing.  I like this so much that my wife might get jealous.  I'd like to take this post for coffee and find out what it thinks about stuff.

720221,Fishing 24/7,2012-08-04 22:56:00,709, Negative on that sir never fished simco in my life. i live 1 from down town ottawa and i fish no further than 2 houres from home.   the weight? nah man i didint weight the fattie but she was 20 '' x 18 girth!  making it the biggest bass iv ever seen in my life. and believe me. iv seen TONS of 5's this is a close 7 lbs bass    sorry to confuse you bro.  the 4.10 was the picture above.  and the 3 lbs bass with the ''1'' lbs perch.  i was just saying.... it had a BRUTE perch in him . is that better ?  i dont eat bass i dont keep bass to freeze i odnt give bass.  i throw them back in the water.  here is the perfect example.
