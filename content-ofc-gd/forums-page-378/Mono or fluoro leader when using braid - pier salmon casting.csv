721385,Burtess,2012-08-09 21:53:00,901,"Hi All,  I am going to try out braid this fall for pier chucking (20lb PowerPro), do I need to use a mono leader with this stuff or can I tie a 3/4oz Cleo on direct?  Is it that visible to the fish?  Thanks, Burt"
721386,davey buoy,2012-08-09 21:55:00,5505, I tie on a swivel clasp then the lure. Works very well!!!!
721406,young_one,2012-08-09 23:15:00,620,"I've tried both mono and fluro leader before, there's really no point if you are using it for line visibility issues. Some people claim a 3 foot section of leader helps to absorb shock, I think its just another extra knot to tie and potentially fail on you. Especially when you fish at night time with glow spoons, tie braid direct with a quality ball barrel cross-lock swivel. I retie my knot after each fish.  My setup: 9'6-10' M-MH rod with fast tip 3000 Shimano Saros 200ish yards of 15lb PowerPro  smaller diameter line will help you cast your spoon further and a 3000 size reel is not too heavy to cast repeatedly all night.  I've yet to have a Salmon spool me   *knock on wood  ps. please bring your own net, try not to borrow other's"

721418,Burtess,2012-08-10 00:00:00,901,OK cool... no leader needed!  I am using a 10' Shimano Convergence with a 3500 size Daiwa....  yes I have my own net with custom extension handle (usually I end up netting everyones fish)...  Is a 125M spool of 20lb PowerPro enough to fill that reel or I think I need to leave some mono on their as filler?  Burt
721437,kyle7273,2012-08-10 00:45:00,65,I have to disagree. I fish with braid now on all my rods and ALWAYS tie on a 4/5 foot section of flouro with a uni to uni knot. It is a very easy knot to tie and reliable. For your application I would use about 12lb flouro. Just my opinion based on my experiences. YRMV Good luck.
721446,bare foot wader,2012-08-10 01:03:00,1354,"I'd splurge on the 300 yd spool, if you're concerned about tying a leader and having extra knots to fail, then why have a knot between you and the salmon when it's got a 100 yds of line out on you? I've never had a fish come close to spooling a 4000 series spool on me, and the spoolings I have witnessed were IMO wrong gear and not enough capacity or cause they let them  happen, laughing and hollering with a loose drag lol...tighten the drag and put side control, make that pig work for it  I use about a 4-6' leader of 20/25 lb big game just for extra abrasion strength when you're close to landing him, bumps some zebra mussels, touches the pier, garbage debris that i always tend to find, etc...I don't trust 15 lb braid around sharp stuff  I tie a 12 turn improved albright that has never failed for me and passes easily through the guides....ball bearing snap swivel to change spoons easy"
721557,northernpike56,2012-08-10 14:47:00,717,  buy the 300 yd spool
