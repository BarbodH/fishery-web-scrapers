721285,Raf,2012-08-09 16:09:00,3495," No.  It only does 2AMP.  You want a charger capable of at least 6-8, preferably 10 amps  This is the one I use and it too goes on sale frequently. It does 2 & 10 amp and will cycle between 2 amp and 10 amp when the battery is almost full.  It will also shut off on its own when the battery is full -- hence automatic charge.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/4/Auto/3/Batteries/BatteryChargers/PRDOVR~0111567P/MotoMaster+Automatic+10%2B2A+Battery+Charger.jsp?locale=en"
721364,hotsky,2012-08-09 20:42:00,400,This is the one I got. (exchanged for the charger I mentioned in the original post) it's half price at $50 right now.  http://www.canadiant...A.jsp?locale=en
721433,camillj,2012-08-10 00:37:00,1988,Le Barons sells a fabulous case for your battery .. it is weather proof and it has a cigarette lighter  for charging your other stuff ... it is vented and has a strong carrying handle/strap ... worth the few extra bucks to protect your investment IMHO
721438,Default User,2012-08-10 00:46:00,72,Slightly off topic - but has anyone tried usin these to power a 30lb MinnKota trolling motor?  http://m.canadiantire.ca/mt/www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/4/Auto/3/Batteries/BatteryBoosting/PRD~0111592P/MotoMaster+Nautilus+Battery+Pack%2C+800+A.jsp?locale=en&un_jtt_v_seltab=features
719558,hotsky,2012-08-02 03:03:00,400,"I picked up a Deep Cycle battery from Costco (750 cranking amps, 115 AP) to use with my Minn Kotta 30lb and just looked over the manual for my Motomaster Eliminator charger and as I never charged a battery other than AA and AAA before  I wanted to hear from people who use them a lot. Manual warns about the danger of explosive gasses, battery exploading and things like that. Now I live in an apartment, is it safe to charge it in my living room? Manual said it needs to be done in well ventilated areas or should I put it out on the balcony? Also is it really that dangerous to have a smoke when you're on the boat with a battery aboard? I was going to get a small cooler and keep the battery in it when I'm on the boat to keep it dry, is that a good idea or does it need to be out? So are these things really that dangerous or it's just lawyer talk?  BTW how long do these batteries keep their charge before dropping to say below 80% when put away fully charged?  Also, how long should I expect my Minn Kotta run for on that battery if I use 3-4 speed?"
719561,BillM,2012-08-02 03:11:00,17367,"One thing I've learned is that automotive chargers tend to boil deep cycle batteries..  You really want a 'smart' charger specifically for these batteries if you want them to last..  They'll step down the charge once the battery is almost full, etc.."
719568,hotsky,2012-08-02 03:31:00,400,"I guess it's just just for DC batteries but you can choose from 2, 8, 12A or auto."
719571,BillM,2012-08-02 03:39:00,17367,"That's just the output amperage though, make sure you keep an eye on the charger and don't let it over charge."
719575,hotsky,2012-08-02 03:47:00,400,"The charger is supposed to switch over to maintenance charge after it's fully charged, but I'll make sure to turn it off as soon as it's at full."
719588,skeeter,2012-08-02 10:46:00,1907,"Do not charge it in your living room. Charge it out on the balcony. Set the charger on 2 amp only to charge a deep cycle. Hook the positive clamp on first, then the negative. When unhooking the clamps, take the negative off first, this will avoid sparking. The gas's that a battery gives off when charging will stink up you apartment. The smoking part means, dont have a cigarette in your hand while handling the battery while it is on the charger. Yes you can smoke in the boat while fishing. As for the cooler to keep the battery dry, not a good idea as gas's can be released from the battery and build up inside the cooler. Besides the battery case is plastic so water wont hurt it.  Batteries can explode if not handled properly, and when they do it is like a bomb exploding. Handle it properly and you wont have to worry."
719593,Garnet,2012-08-02 11:01:00,2056,Do not charge deep cycle battery's on 2 amp you will never get it fully charged.  They like to be charged immediately and 10amp minimum. And smart chargers intended for deep cycle battery's.
719594,Roy,2012-08-02 11:12:00,13728,"The link below will give you everything you need to know about deep cycle batteries including method for proper charging/maintenance. If you read it just one time, you'll already know more than most people know about deep cycle batteries.  http://www.windsun.com/Batteries/Battery_FAQ.htm#Battery%20Charging"
719773,hotsky,2012-08-02 22:32:00,400,"Thanks for the link.  Another question Is it OK for the battery to be charged part way than turned off (if I have to leave somewhere), and continued charging later? OR should I make sure it's always charged till full?"
719776,Rod Caster,2012-08-02 22:55:00,5784,"The ""smart"" eliminator charger is on sale at CT tomorrow for 20.00. At least in north bay.  I just bouught a quaker state, have used it for about 7 hrs on my Minnkota 30lbs and so far still have full power. I was told to nearly kill the battery before charging it... But I'm going to read Roys link before I take further advice from acquaintances"
719914,Default User,2012-08-03 13:57:00,72, is this the one? http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/4/Auto/3/Batteries/BatteryChargers/PRD~0111506P/MotoMaster+Eliminator+Intelligent+Battery+Charger%2C+2A.jsp?locale=en
719923,Rod Caster,2012-08-03 14:14:00,5784, Ezactly. Im on my way out the door to get the sale price.. I paid full price just last week.
719925,asdve23rveavwa,2012-08-03 14:22:00,2690,"  Seems to be more of a maintenance type charger, Chad.  Great for keeping your battery topped up, but, will take forever to charge it if you run it low."
719948,Garnet,2012-08-03 15:04:00,2056,When I worked in a battery plant for 12 years it was often said if battery's were invented today they would never be legalized because of there explosive nature.
719957,Rod Caster,2012-08-03 15:36:00,5784," For the many hours of use I get from a full charge, I don't mind waiting 24 hrs or more for re-charging. If its not charged yet, just pull out the paddles hahaha."
719971,asdve23rveavwa,2012-08-03 16:11:00,2690,"  Nice, good price on it anyways!"
720022,hotsky,2012-08-03 19:36:00,400,"I got a different one on sale last week it was either 40 or 50% off paid $49.99 it has a 2, 8 and 12A options as well as auto."
720128,Dabluz,2012-08-04 05:00:00,701,"Well....for your information, your battery is not a deep cycle battery so any battery charger will work fine.  Deep cycle batteries are not rated in how many amps of cranking power they have.  They are rated in how minutes of reserve capacity.  Also....a normal sized deep cycle battery cannot give you 750 amps of cranking power.  Only a starting battery can do that."
720151,whiskywizard,2012-08-04 14:01:00,305," No! The guy who told you this... does he sell batteries?  To get the best life from deep cycle batteries, never discharge them below 50%. when you buy the battery, ""Upsize"" so you don't need that bottom 50% and you'll love the battery for many years."
720154,Rod Caster,2012-08-04 14:30:00,5784," Thanks! After reading Roy's link I reassessed and put on my trickle charger. My deep cycle is 24hr reserve, so it's got more than enough for my 30lbs MinnKota"
720406,Default User,2012-08-05 19:39:00,72,Grabbed one today. There were about 6 left at the Rylander location as of noon today

720419,hotsky,2012-08-05 20:23:00,400,i excanged Mine today for Moto Master Nautilus charger thats now on sale half price for $49.99. im not sure if its waterproof but looks like a better charger for what im looking for.
720427,Terry,2012-08-05 20:49:00,14456," batteries should not be charged on trickle charge maybe if your battery never gets under 85% fully charged, but even then I would want to bulk charge it now and then"
720429,whiskywizard,2012-08-05 20:56:00,305, Thank you! I wasn't getting through.
