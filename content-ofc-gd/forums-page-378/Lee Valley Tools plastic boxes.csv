Bought a couple and plan to use them for terminal tackle to supplement the Planos I currently use. They have internal dividers but not very many per box (which is fine as I have a bag of extra Plano ones I don't think I'll ever need). The King St. store had a number of the square boxes but fewer of the larger ones. No idea if the Steeles or Morningside locations have similar stock.  The square ones are roughly 5 1/2""x 5 1/2"" x 1 1/2"" and the longer ones are same depth and thickness but 10 3/4"" on the long side. $8.50 for 5 of the smaller ones or 3 of the larger ones. I put a couple of lures and such in the square box for size context.  One thing I like about the dividers is that there seem to be better adjustments on them vs others designed for fishing.        "
