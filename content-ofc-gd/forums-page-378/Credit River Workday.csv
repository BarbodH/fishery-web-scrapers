721510,john from craa,2012-08-10 12:03:00,39,"CRAA Tree Nuresery and Farm Event Saturday, August 11, 2012 9:00 am to 1 PM Meet at the CRAA Tree Nursery (Glen Williams - between Georgetown and Terra Cotta). Take Mississauga Road north, left on Old School Road and follow to river valley. Work site is at corner of Old School and 10th Sideroad - signs will be up.  Bring gloves, sunscreen, a hat and sunglasses. I also suggest long pants if possible.  Part 1 will be to build new planting beds, move potted trees to plastic sheets for winter and pre-fill pots for next spring.  Part 2 will be installing tree guards at the Hanc0ck farm that we planted in April. The trees are doing well but must be tree guarded by fall or the beavers will cut them down.  We need 25-30 people out so make sure you plant to attend and bring your friends too!  Project should be 4-5 hours depending on turnout.  We will have lots of cold water. Work is rain or shine!  Please post this message on any chat boards as well to spread the word.!  John"
