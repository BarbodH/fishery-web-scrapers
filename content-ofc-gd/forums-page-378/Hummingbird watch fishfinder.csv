721455,hotsky,2012-08-10 01:28:00,400,"I was looking thru a catalog and saw a Hummingbird SmartCast RF35 watch fish finder. Where you cast a bobber sensor that looks like a trigger lock. and signal is transmitted to a watch fish finder (up to about 20m). It can be used as a bobber but only supports ~5.5gr of weight. I thought it would be perfect from shore fishing and when I'm fishing from my inflatable to see how deep I am, bottom structure and of course if any fish are underneath. Reviews online are rather mixed tho, so I was hoping to hear from people here who used them. It's about $80; is it worth it?"
721467,pics,2012-08-10 02:30:00,1268,spend a few bucks more for a portable for the inflatable....try to find one used..
721470,ccmtcanada,2012-08-10 02:37:00,7971,I did a review on one here once...its good if you are a shore angler for depth and structure.  It does detect fish as I tested it in a shallow area where I could see a fish...but its obviously not as good as a real unit.  I had it on its own rod...with heavy braid so there no chance of losing it.  I used it for a short period...as once I found good shore spots close to home there was no need for it any longer.  If I had a canoe or inflatable I likely would have used it more.  I'd rate it a 6 or 7 out of 10.
