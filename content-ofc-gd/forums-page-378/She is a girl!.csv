Cool, so we were excited and ready. But when the doctor came and scan, he said the baby was upside down. So the head was facing the opposite of exit. We need a c-section!  After 2 more hours. Tada, a heathy 8lb 5oz baby girl. Soooo happy  Wife and baby are doing fine!  Life is soooo beautifully good! Happy happy!"
