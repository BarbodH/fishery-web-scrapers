720709,Leecher,2012-08-07 02:20:00,7832,"Paul and I talked last night about going out fishing today, walleyes was in the back of our minds since we both, had not targeted them in a while... and the weather was looking better / cooler than it was these past couple of days, was really looking forward to it  We left home around 8h00am, made a couple of pit stops for gas and hot brew and the way we go     Destination North bound, the Old Pond   Weather wise, a North Westerly was blowing at around 10-15km/h and the sun was shinning.... PERFECT  To make a long story short, we got into a few walleyes, LMB's, SMB's, snot rockets and had a great time  Lures of choice were: Whitespinnerbait, Live target cranks (deep & shallow diving), walleye diver (deep diving), 3/8oz & 1/4oz jigs with twister tails tip with dew worm  Did not take many pics throughout our stay, but managed a few for your viewing pleasure  First fish for Paul... 17 1/4"" walleye    Next up.... Smallie   Dark Colored    Next up... Largie    Smallie   Hand shot    Largie    Hand shot    We moved around quite a bit to try and locate the active walleye but it was a hard bite    I caught 2 eyes that were under slot and had to be released... no pics  Paul finished the day with this beauty largie   a solid fish that hit his walleye diver like a freight train    All fish were released to fight another day (except Paul's Keeper eye) Hope you enjoy Until next time Tight lines TJunkie"
