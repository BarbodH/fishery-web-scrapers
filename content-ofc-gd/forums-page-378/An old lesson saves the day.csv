720869,UglyBug,2012-08-07 22:17:00,148,"Many years ago I worked driving large fork lifts in wood mill. As part of the training we received we were drilled that If the  lift rolled hang on tight and ride to the bottom. Today I rolled my 700 pound Deere 360 degrees down a large bank. Some how I remembered to duck down and hold on. The tractor got trashed but I only came out with a slight back twist.,  If I had of jumped I am sure the blades would have removed something important. Just a reminder how quick life can change. I am amazed that i came out relativly unhurt.   Looking over my shoulder.  I think I will go fishing know and reflect"
