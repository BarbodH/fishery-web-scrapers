720795,LdnFisher,2012-08-07 16:34:00,3,"So I've been fishing in the Thames for a few weeks now, just in town, I've been staying mainly around the Thames golf course, with little results, maybe half a dozen rock/sm a day, all quite small. I'm wondering if anyone else has been trying this mucky river? Where are the fish at?"
720797,Headhunter,2012-08-07 16:39:00,5703,"Firstly, welcome to the board... Here's a few spots that have worked in the past... -fork of the Thames downtown -below Springbank dam -train bridge in Greenway park (Carp/suckers) -Wonderland bridge  The area near the golf course is not the best area to fish... if you wuold provide us with an idea of targeted species, I could be more specific...

720809,bow slayer,2012-08-07 18:04:00,1074,"if you fish the oxford st. bridge area it is good for smallies and the odd pike. Gibbons Park area also has some good water for smallies. Below the dam at Fanshawe you can catch a real mixed bag of pike,bass and walleye.The dam beside Labatts can also be good at the right times of the year."
720810,LdnFisher,2012-08-07 18:04:00,3,"Thank you HeadHunter, I hope it'll help me out a little, never enough you can know about fishing.. I usually go to specific ponds and lakes, but.. Carp, wallies, bass-   are the main ones I focus on.  I moved to London a few years ago and completely stopped fishing, wet a hook a month ago and I still can't understand why I stopped, I used to be quite avid."
720812,Ralph Field,2012-08-07 18:05:00,1018,The water is so low in the Thames right now I'm surprised anyone is bothering to fish it.
720813,Headhunter,2012-08-07 18:06:00,5703,Taken to PM... HH
720814,LdnFisher,2012-08-07 18:08:00,3,It's good for people like me who don't quite have the means to go anywhere better right now though..
720815,Headhunter,2012-08-07 18:14:00,5703,"Also, keep an eye to Springbank Dam as we get closer to September as trout and salmon make there way to the dam... HH"
