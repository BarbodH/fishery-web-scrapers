200961,bowshep,2008-05-13 11:24:00,378,Thanks Daplumma. What did they use for bait... Roe... lol
201001,BITEME,2008-05-13 12:32:00,1969,Flossed him with Marshmellows
201003,Stoty,2008-05-13 12:36:00,2910, HAHAHAH   Wonder if they used a net?
201070,highdrifter,2008-05-13 15:19:00,2534,What a sad sight.  I was hoping it was a release shot..  A great fish... reduced to cat food.
201073,nautifish,2008-05-13 15:23:00,1416,Sharks scare me.
201077,Mike01,2008-05-13 15:26:00,378,"nice looking fish.  Doesn't look like its 850 though, could just be the picture"
201136,LeXXington,2008-05-13 17:28:00,1928," I wish at least it would be used,.. nope cut the fin's for soup and drop the rest in the water."
201341,Swimgirl,2008-05-14 00:58:00,2,Here's the link to more pictures.
201342,Swimgirl,2008-05-14 01:00:00,2,OOPS!  Wrong link.   HERE'S the link to more pictures!
201361,Hookset,2008-05-14 01:29:00,367, The picture of that 850 lb'er jumping is amazing. Wonder if those sharks would hit say...a 2 foot long Chug Bug ?  Hookset.
201412,Crazyhook,2008-05-14 03:08:00,1154,as for the fish being wasted it was not. If you have ever eaten mako shark you would understand that..... great fish to catch and to eat. Big fish should be released but at least many people were givin fresh fish for the table
