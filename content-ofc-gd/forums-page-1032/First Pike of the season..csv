201489,cranks bait,2008-05-14 12:05:00,721,"Been out a few times with no luck this year so far.  Well kind of no luck.  I've caught a couple of 3-4 lbs oos bass and a couple of measily perch.  Last night I skipped out of work early, it was way to nice not too.  Came accross a ship heading o my spot.  After I took the picture I thought to myself, what was that post on OFC about taking pictures of vessels on boarder waters?  Oh well.  Had a few really good hits while trolling, but didn't land anything, not sure what happened there?  Then throughing a little spinner I caught this beauty.  She put up a nice fight for sure.  It was great hearing the drag scream again.  Measured in at 30 inches.  Not sure of the weight, but it was heavy.  Not sure if it had just eaten something or is pre spawn as it was pretty plump.  I did not submit this pic for the tourney as I know I'll get a bigger one.  "

201529,Stoty,2008-05-14 13:13:00,2910," I just turn the date stamp off on my camera. Because I tend to print/frame a lot of pictures I take, the date on the picture just ruins it."
