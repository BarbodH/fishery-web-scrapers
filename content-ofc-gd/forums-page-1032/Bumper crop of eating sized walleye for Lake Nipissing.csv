Link:  http://www.nugget.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e...h=Brandi+Cramer    Copy/Paste:  'Phenomenal' fishing; Anglers, bait dealers counting down to walleye season Posted By Brandi Cramer Posted 1 hour ago Tammie Pecore's shopping list Tuesday included worms.  Pecore says she's ""hardcore"" when it comes to angling - her wedding ring has fish engraved on it - and was buying bait to entice splake. ""Damn right I am looking forward to a weekend of fishing,"" she said. ""It's relaxing, it's freedom and peace of mind and you get outdoors.""  The good news for Pecore is if the Ministry of Natural Resources is right, this fishing season could be one to remember.  Walleye season is set to open Saturday at 12:01 a.m. and Mike Regis, district enforcement supervisor with the ministry, predicts it will be ""phenomenal.""  ""There were a lot of 12- to 15-inchers last year,"" he said. ""They will have grown and will be great in the frying pan this year.""  Richard Rowe's analysis of data for the past two years shows the same thing.  A biologist with Nipissing First Nation's natural resources department, Rowe said there will be a lot of ""catchable fish.""  ""Walleye fishing goes up and down based on strong year classes,"" he said.  A strong year class occurs when conditions are perfect during the spawning season.  ""It takes three years to grow a perfect frying pan-size fish,"" Rowe said.  In 2005, conditions were perfect with high water levels, a warm and stable spring, and a long growing season.  Advertisement  ""We had a good summer that year. That means there is lots for walleye to eat and once they get by the first winter, survival rates are very high,"" Rowe said.  Bob Esch, owner of Trout Lake Bait and Canoe, expects Lake Nipissing will be ""super busy"" this weekend judging by how much his phone has been ringing.  ""I am definitely not going fishing,"" he said, but he will ensure ""hundreds if not thousands"" have the right tools.  His business is kept viable by catering to different species including splake and rainbow trout.  But the start of walleye season Saturday will open the flood gates.  ""We will start getting extra busy Thursday morning,"" Esch said, adding his store hours are long - ""sun up to sun down.""  He is ready with a healthy supply of shiners, chubs, dace, worms and leeches, as well as tackle.  And for those uncertain of what to put on their lines, Esch is more than willing to offer guidance.  ""If it's a cold spring and the water stays cold, a minnow is the best way to go. If it warms up - worms and leeches,"" he said.  Rowe also had tips for anglers planning to catch and release.  ""Play the fish quickly, handle it quickly and in the water,"" he said.  Regis reminds eager anglers to measure catches carefully to avoid violating any regulations.  And if you planned on having a few cold ones - do it on shore.  ""Booze and boating don't mix,"" Regis said. ""If you have (alcohol) in the boat we have the authority to charge you.  ""The key message is be safe and have fun.""

201533,Gerritt,2008-05-14 13:24:00,6129,I will be there for opener!  G

201547,Gerritt,2008-05-14 13:42:00,6129,Not really sure where that is Mike..  If I had a VHF we could be in contact... (Soon enough I will have one)  If you feel like making the trek from Callader Bay Look for a Beige Polar Kraft or a Sea Swirl (Bit of a haul though LOL) we will more then likely be West of the Bumble Bee Channel Marker.  Have a great opener Mike!  G
