195759,Ramble,2008-05-03 03:51:00,713," Hello again,  I've been pretty busy since school ended on the 23rd of April. I managed to get some turkey hunting in with a close friend and then I was back in Peterborough getting everything ready to move to the new place for next year.  On the 24th however I managed to get out in the canoe with my g/f Dominique on the Moira River. We put in at O’Brian’s bridge (for those of you who are interested). As expected the water level was still very high, and most of the silver maple swamp as under water. It allowed for a rare canoeing experience that comes along once every few years, and we sure weren’t disappointed.   The current was strong and impressive to say the least. There were amazing debris lines, and pockets of calm water which didn’t photograph well but were VERY interesting to see in a river which usually has a different ""face” to it.     After some paddling the main channel with, we entered the swamp and navigated about 200 yards back into the woods. Zigzagging through the swamp, with the birds singing in the trees, and the frogs singing in t he distance we paddled on.          After an hour of exploring in the swamp, we still hadn’t found the river bank, and so we headed back to the main channel.        We took our time popping in and out of the swamp, before pulling into a back-water and breaking out the ham sandwiches for lunch.    On the way back to upstream we spotted several muskrats, which were enjoying the high water.      High water marks.   After fighting the current back to the car, we packed up and headed out to check a few of my spring fishing spots on the Mighty Moira....not surprisingly, they were all underwater.  We passed another of my minnow trapping spots, only to find that fiddleheads were well on their way to being fully opened. So we pulled over, I dug out my pocket knife and we collected a hat full for dinner.          It's a beautiful piece of land to say the least.      Three days later I was wrapping up turkey hunting with Jeff. He was heading out to Saskatchewan to guide their spring bear hunt the next morning before winding his way to B.C. to guide in the mountains for his 2nd summer. The other 2 guys we had been hunting with both ended up having an amazing hunt on the 3rd day in a different field. They both bagged beautiful Tom's at the same time. Jeff and I had only heard some gobblers, and saw a few hens.  That last afternoon we took a break from hunting and headed to the bush for a wander and to round up some more fiddleheads for dinner. I dropped him off at his place and headed home. I won’t see him again till deer season.        Creek Chub were making some reds in the gravelly areas.   Tempting Fate             Here is an interesting pic. The downed tree has adapted and the “branches” have become “trunks” and so life goes on. A nifty little trick that always brings a smile.    The end of April was great, and I'm now looking forward to some more nice weather with the fishing season beginning to open, before I head north for the summer.  I can’t wait to get the paddles wet again.   Tight Lines  -R-  "

201457,Moosebunk,2008-05-14 05:00:00,3970,Sorry to have missed this one Dave.  Ya got an eye with that camera bud and you really take time out on your excursions to take in many little things that much of us don't pay much attention too.

201615,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-14 15:42:00,0,Excellant report! Those trees in the water remind me of Florida fishing. I wonder if it will start receding any time soon. I have to try those fiddle heads one day!
201769,kayak fisher,2008-05-14 21:58:00,66,"mmmmmm.....fiddleheads.  Just a friendly warning to those who do not know, one of the most common ferns in southern Ontario is the Bracken fern.  This looks exactly like the edible ostrich ferns (tastes like them too), however it is poisonous to many animals including humans. It breaks down vitamin B in the body and the poisoning is said to have similar symptoms to radiation poisoning. I only know this because I picked a bunch and did some research before I ate them.  Here is a pretty cool link (if you are thinking of picking some good ones)  :  http://wildwoodsurvival.com/survival/food/...fern/index.html"
