201104,BillM,2008-05-13 16:15:00,17367,"I spend as much time out on the water fishing as I can, but I can't eat the fish...  I'm allergic to them.    Although Roy's thread with the bacon wrapped pickerel looks realllly good!"
201105,e-z-out,2008-05-13 16:17:00,1052,That truly has to suck. I'm a bit the same but i have to catch my fish to eat them i can't go to a store and buy them it's not the same as catching it yourself and eating it.
201114,capt bruce,2008-05-13 16:41:00,820,"At least you can fish , my friend cant even come sit on the boat , I like to take a 10 or 15 people to watch the fire works or just go out for a night cruise to Ontario place and even with cleaning up the boat he still cant go out , he got real sick when we went to a korean restraunt where you cook the food at the table and even tho we didnt cook any fish at the table next to us they had fish and the fumes I guess got him."
201170,BillM,2008-05-13 18:44:00,17367,"Luckily for me my allergy isn't that bad, atleast to fish.  Nuts on the other hand are deadly for me.  I can handle the fish all I want, as long as I don't touch the raw flesh, I am good.  I do get the odd hives if I get stuck with one of the fins"
201202,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-13 20:31:00,3761,"I am outside as much as you can and i have all those horrible allergies, ragweed,trees,cutgrass,pollen. You know all the things we fishermen are exposed to shore fishing or even out on the water."
