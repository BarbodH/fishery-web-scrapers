201211,007,2008-05-13 20:41:00,537,"Hi folks.  As some of you may remember, last year I set myself the task of trying to catch as many different fish species in Ontario as possible over the course of the fishing year.  I did ok in my 'quest' and caught many different species though many of them were small, except for some big carp and largemouth bass.  Now that I am no longer in Ontario and really missing the fishing I was wondering if anyone out there would like to take on the challenge this year and do short reports with pics of all the species that they catch this year.  I know there are lots of good all-round fishermen on this board who could do better than i did and I would be curious to see who could catch the most different species!  So is anybody up for the challenge?  In return, once I have settled in my new home on this side of the pond near London, England and the fishing season starts in mid June I will try to give you some reports from fishing my local lakes, rivers and canals with pics of the different species we have over here.  007"

201219,snag,2008-05-13 21:18:00,1932,"I catch the incidental tree, chair and humanoid. Can I include them?   Seriously,  If your mug is in the pic than it should work, no?  Oh wait, there are some here that have posed with other peoples fish!  Dang!  What to do??   Good to hear from you!"

Seems like Cliff has opted out but we all know he and Bly will catch more species than anyone else without even trying LOL  Anyone else want to see how many species they can catch this year?  007"
