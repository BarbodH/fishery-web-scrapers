Cash is always the best bet but is not always feasible. What steps would you guys recommend to help reduce the chance of fraud? A Louisville ??  Thanks,  Meely"
201354,bullybass,2008-05-14 01:16:00,144,I would say set up a paypal account and have him/her do the same... it can be linked to their bank and credit cards and there is insurance included usually like when you buy anything on eBay... just my .02 cents... good luck to you!!

I've never been ripped off getting paid with a certified cheque. although I've friends that have been ripped off.  Or you can insist for $$ ...if the cheque is good he can go $$ it himself.
201362,Gerritt,2008-05-14 01:30:00,6129,Is cash is not an option..  Money order or for larger amounts a Bank drafts are pretty legit.  G
201363,forrest,2008-05-14 01:35:00,1032,"It depends on the amount, how much?  Check with your bank, banks are always best.  Even bank certified checks can be no good (go figure).  IDs and checks can be forged and often are, a crew will come to town and set up shop for a small while and go on a ""spending"" spree.  They crooks have a lot of good tools.  Make sure you do likewise for the person buying.  Have all documentation and as much proof of ownership as you can reasonably get.  forrest"
