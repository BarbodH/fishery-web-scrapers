Here are some victims.  The walleye was 27 inches. The pike 32.  Was hoping to get into some active eyes, but the place is like a shopping mall on the weekend.  Not to mention another derby.  Enjoy.

201714,Headhunter,2008-05-14 19:50:00,5703,"Nice Eye brother! If I was heading that way this weekend, I'd be keeping a very close eye on water temperature and find areas where warmer water from shallow bays enters into any main bay areas. Also, consider any wind blown areas that may stack warmer water, with deep water access near by. HH"
