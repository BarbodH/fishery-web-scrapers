201574,BFSC Kevin,2008-05-14 14:20:00,1351,"Well I'm almost done and ready!  since getting my current crestliner at the end of last year, this week I just put in...  4 scotty power lock rod holders (might even stick in another 2?) -this took alot of work to crawl under the gunwale and pull out some of the foam with limited space. ram mount lowrance x25(transom plate, transducer, speed, wiring, connectors etc) new battery trays new deep cycle battery replaced my power drive with a maxxum put in a new trolling motor receptacle and new wiring with circuit breaker and ALOT of drilling, bolting and screwing plus I added a 5hp kicker last year too..  all that is left is repaint if I want and putting on that transom saver... which would require me to lift the boat a bit off the roller or push the boat foward..   Just wanted to share my joy! Maybe I would have a pic once I'm done."
