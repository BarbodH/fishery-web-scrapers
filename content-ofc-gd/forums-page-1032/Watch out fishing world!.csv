201316,kemper,2008-05-13 23:52:00,2232,The pink BPS hat was completely her idea too....I didnt even have to force it!  although pink is well.... there are better options
201397,Rich,2008-05-14 02:42:00,3927,Get used to being outfished... by handing her a rod you have in turn cursed yourself!
201401,ccmtcanada,2008-05-14 02:51:00,7971,"Yep...Bly outfishes me.... My 6 year old outfishes me.... Even when our oldest daughter comes along, I don't catch anything....  Don't even start talking about the bathroom situation here at home.....LOL."
201534,Rattletrap2,2008-05-14 13:25:00,1652,"Oh yeah, you are done for now! I have only had a chance to fish the river behind our home once this year for 45 minutes one night. My wife asked for a turn and caught the first fish, then went and told the youngest daughter. She came out and took over the rod and caught one for herself. Me?????....none!  Moral of this story.....when getting a rod rigged, rig a few spares as well!  Oh and CCMT, tell me about the bathroom thing! I too have three daughters and a wife. We moved to a house with one less bathroom, and it's been all downhill since then! I'd have better chances of sharing a tree in the yard with the family dog!"
201554,brooks999,2008-05-14 14:01:00,38, When fishing with my Wife and kid....It is not uncommon for me to have 6 rods rigged and ready.......  Neither can tie a knot or get a fish off  I would never get to fish.
201587,JohnAB,2008-05-14 14:54:00,178," Now that is funny!  Yep and once you let the fairer sex in on fishing with you, you are doomed to be second fiddle to them the rest of your life."
201598,ccmtcanada,2008-05-14 15:15:00,7971, LOL...just do your business down by the river behind your yard....oh yeah...and bring your fishing rod with you....
201612,maybe,2008-05-14 15:39:00,307, Hmmm....this sounds like a great excuse to buy more rods.  Thanks!
