201482,splashhopper,2008-05-14 11:36:00,2931," Hey 2""tone"":  When I lived in a ""white tight assed little town""  as a teenager,called Stratford Ontario, ignorance bigotry and racism was right there all the time, just under the surface. I was the kinda guy that assumed the black guy in town was the dishwasher at one of the restaurants and the chinese people owned the chineses restaurants.  This is the type of ""subtle"" racism that exists in many small towns/cities in this country ... Take a good hard look in the mirror in ""Z-71 pick up land"".   You see, I had never been exposed to another culture that was not of white european descent. I had NO CLUE how bigotted I really was.  When i moved to Toronto for college, I had a BIG awakening.  I now live in London and it is a little more civilized than Stratford, mainly due to the University and college populations here though.   As a guy that is now married to a beautiful FILIPINO GODDESS(for 15 years) with a heart bigger than I could ever have deserved on my wish list, I find your ignorant post just that IGNORANT! I also have an amazing 18 and 23 yrs old step son and daughter with her and our own 10 yr old daughter because of her love for me.  Here are a couple of words to think about in case you never get out of your city again:  ig·no·rant Pronunciation: \ˈig-n(ə-)rənt\ Function: adjective Date: 14th century 1 a: destitute of knowledge or education <an ignorant society>; also : lacking knowledge or comprehension of the thing specified <parents ignorant of modern mathematics> b: resulting from or showing lack of knowledge or intelligence  big·ot Pronunciation: \ˈbi-gət\ Function: noun Etymology: French, hypocrite, bigot Date: 1660 : a person obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices; especially : one who regards or treats the members of a group (as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance  rac·ism Pronunciation: \ˈrā-ˌsi-zəm also -ˌshi-\ Function: noun Date: 1933 1 : a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race 2 : racial prejudice or discrimination  ....................................................................................................................................  Before you respond to this, please think about HOW your post came across to many peopel on this sight, (of all skin colours)  Possibly, your INTENT was not to offend, but your ACTIONS did.  God bless splashhoper and family"
201497,Pigeontroller,2008-05-14 12:28:00,2793,"Racism will always exist. Worse things happen in this world because of it than people being pushed into the water.  I don't condone this but lets not forget about the fact that it does have abit to do with resource abuse/poaching, call it what you want...I wouldn't for a second suggest that all muslims are terrorists, or that all young black men are gang-bangers, or that all Asians are poachers...Or that all white people are racist because they aren't afraid to broach this subject!  We need more enforcement of fish and game laws in this province. And a mandatory test to get your fishing licsence, proving you understand the different fish species,seasons,limits,etc. Maybe sign a contract that you understand and will obey so if you get caught with a trunk full of fish there will be no excuses!"

201511,holdfast,2008-05-14 12:52:00,1813,"Hey, Squeel like a piggy, you just made a racist comment to all the so called red necks.  What a go, your no better you bleeding heart attention getter.  I bet you go around with a notebook taking names don't you every time you feel harrassed. What I got from 2 Tones comment was that he thought there should be a different section for this kind of thread and all he wanted to see a fishing only with pictures as he was tired with the Bull on the subject. I don't agree with him, but you don't have to call him names and make accusations that are not warranted.  And especially stop playing moral cop and throwing the Racist accusation word around. Too many people are doing it on the board here."
