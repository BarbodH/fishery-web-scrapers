200625,scuro,2008-05-12 19:58:00,386," Went fishing south of Timmins this last weekend. There is still some snow up there.    It was the first time I had fished with Dan, we had never met but talked for years over the internet. He was an awesome host and taught me a thing or three.    We fished specs in the morning on this lake.    They were aggressive Saturday and gun shy Sunday. I'm enjoying Saturday morning here.    Caught about a dozen for a couple hours work.    Later in the day we spent a lot of time looking into water like this.    ...or this, but the lake was still too cold to see dem' gators up shallow. We could only could find a few juveniles scattered around the lake, both deep and shallow.   Saw three new species of birds, a black bear, two moose, and what I am guessing is a male partridge. This dude wouldn't let me past on my way home. His partner on the side of the road ran away into the bushes. Women! It was nice to be out on the water again finally and in a beautiful corner of the world."

200799,Cookslav,2008-05-13 00:28:00,1457,Nice looking fish! And that grouse shot is great...got the whole elvis collar going LOL... What were you using by chance? Just curious Thanks for sharing!
200804,Crazyhook,2008-05-13 00:35:00,1154,beauty fish man!
200830,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-05-13 01:06:00,1362,nice report and pics...
200844,scuro,2008-05-13 01:26:00,386,"No worries, to separate lakes. The pike and specs never had the chance to meet. We used small spinners and small rapellas, both worked equally well.  I like catching specs plenty but they don't get my heart racing when all hell breaks lose with a massive gator on the other end of the line."
200927,jace,2008-05-13 08:06:00,472,cool pictures.  I grew up near there and havn'et been back in a very long time....since leaving for school in SWO.     How far south of timmins were you fishing?   I used to have so much fun catching specks not much bigger than a perch in tiny streams and lakes down logging roads.  and that ruffed grouse is best photographed when wrapped in bacon.
200930,solopaddler,2008-05-13 08:37:00,8605,"Beautiful fish, looks like a fun trip regardless of the lack of pike."
200954,scuro,2008-05-13 11:10:00,386, We were in the Gogama region.
200959,jediangler,2008-05-13 11:17:00,1923,Great photos of a beautiful place. I learned to ride a motorcycle near there at lake Papakamika (sp?) on a balloon tired suzuki 90. I remember the kids at the bible camp threw rocks at us.
200969,mattyk,2008-05-13 11:35:00,2110,"thanks for sharing, some nice pics!"
200978,ccmtcanada,2008-05-13 11:46:00,7971,"Great scenery, some real nice fish, and fishing with a fellow OFNer...doesn't get much better than that!"
201438,Moosebunk,2008-05-14 04:04:00,3970,"He!! Chris, you were only 7-8 hours away and you didn't even poke your head in for a pint.  Some sweet specks in that report and great scenery shots too.  Nice report dood."
