My wife Cheryl came along, as did my bud Patrick. We had a decent day, fished for 9 solid hours under beatiful weather conditions. 10 pike landed for the day, all between 22"" and 27"", all released. (I caught 7, Patrick 2, Cheryl 1) We also had numerous follows and Cheryl had what was probably the best fish of the day on for a few seconds at boatside and then lost it (probably a low to mid 30's inch pike). Water temps ranged between 60F and 63F, weeds have not really come in at all yet. Spoons were the hot lure for the day.  I was also extremely happy with the warranty repairs done on my boat by BPS thru Grumpy's Marine - the boat stayed bone dry all day, every rivet is perfect now.  One ""duh"" for the day, I forgot my OFC tourney sign at home - sorry team Angler Management! No bigguns anyhow, I will try to get a 30""+ for us on the next trip there...      "
