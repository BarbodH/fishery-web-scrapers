It was a really crappie day for the matter that not only did i not catch anything but my spinngy reel pretty much fell apart, But spirits can only go up so if anyone is ever looking to go down to the island i am always interested. later guys"
201402,ccmtcanada,2008-05-14 02:53:00,7971,Hey White007...your time will come!  You are out there quite a bit and my instincts tell me we'll be seeing some fish pics soon.  Don't give up...keep on trying!  Thanks for the report.
201439,mistaredone,2008-05-14 04:05:00,913,Ha ha!  Did you burn big baits all day or did you slow it down like I told you?  Im washing the musky lures down at Bronte in the morning.  Hope to maybe hit some trout or salmon while ut there.  Biggest fish 2008 race is on!!!
