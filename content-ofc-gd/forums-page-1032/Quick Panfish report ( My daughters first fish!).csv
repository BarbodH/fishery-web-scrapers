She asks me to take her fishing all the time now. We wouldn't want to disappoint her, so there will be more fishing in her future. Which means more fishing for me too."

200712,Crazyhook,2008-05-12 22:49:00,1154,Funny thing is I had a few pieces of corn on her Dora rod... a huge 30+ pound carp started feeding right around her hook. I had to reel it in.... ( be going back this week for the carp!)  Lew.. I really hope she gets into musky fishing.. then I can buy double the baits

200871,Tinman,2008-05-13 02:08:00,376,"Great Report! Nothing beats the squeels of laughter when they catch a fish. I have a little girl that loves fishing that same spot i think, Manotick? Pm me if you ever want to get the girls together for a fish!"
