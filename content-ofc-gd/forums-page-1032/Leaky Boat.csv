201172,Scott S,2008-05-13 18:49:00,203,"I need some help with this one. I bought a boat in January from an older gentlemen,said the boat doesn't leak. Guess what it leaks!!! I've changed the live well hose and put on a new pump. Now all that's left to check is the rivets. Is there any other way of checking, besides putting water in the boat or is there something else that I'm missing. Any tips will be appreciated!! Thanks Scooter"
201196,caljohns,2008-05-13 19:52:00,1,"I also just bought a boat that kept wanting to sink on me, basically you have to get under there and carefully inspect for loose rivets you can just move with your hands. Then once youve found your problem spots clean them up as much as you can, sand them, clean again, and apply JB water weld ( a tube of putty you just knead to activate) let it dry solid and that should stop your leaking problem. Its a long process but it ends up being worth it, my boat stays bone dry now and couldnt be happier. Oh I also sprayed a stop leak sealant over everything once to insure the putty holds. good luck!"
201218,Uncle Buck,2008-05-13 21:08:00,1000,"2 things to learn in Life  1. boat doesn't leak - True, inside a garage, no boat will leak  2. It ran the last time out - Obviously, cause no one is gonna take a motor out for a nice paddle ride...  i've heard coating the inside bottom with the roll on truck liner helps stop leaks...  but don't quote me on it..."
201285,Pinch,2008-05-13 23:17:00,231," I dont know what type of boat you have, or if this would work, but could you fill the inside of the boat with water and then watch to see where the water comes out?"
201328,addict,2008-05-14 00:23:00,475,if it leaks bad then fix it if its minor live with it most older aluminum boats will start to leak eventually.when i bought mine i repaced reivets and used jb weld she stayed dry for many yrs now she gets about a litre in the bottom after a full day out i can live with that i just pop the drain on the ride home.
201338,boatman,2008-05-14 00:46:00,350,"Of course, the correct answer is to fix it properly with new rivets or at least pound the existing leaky rivets. However, sometimes hammering on the rivets won't fix the problem or you can't access both sides or you are just too lazy...whatever. So you are forced to look for alternatives. Two products I have used with great success are Gluvit and polyeurathane sealant. Both have their pros and cons, but work well. I prefer the poly."
201420,forrest,2008-05-14 03:24:00,1032,  How would you get enough pressure to get the leak to leak?  forrest
201442,LundGuy,2008-05-14 04:12:00,169,"  Water height equals head, thus weight, thus pressure. If left in over night water will find the way out, doesn't take much."
201478,pikehunter,2008-05-14 11:06:00,1659,"Life lessons that are proven true daily!  Good one Unc.B.  If you can see both sides of the offending rivet(s) use 2 hammers, one inside and one outside of the boat. Hold the heavier hammer  steady in place on one end of the rivet and tap the other end of the rivet with the other hammer and this will help to tighten them up."
201501,Greencoachdog,2008-05-14 12:41:00,8163,"Fill your bilge or the inside of the boat with water, it's the easiest way to find a leak. It may not be a rivet, might be a small hole or crack. If there's a way out, water will find it... and it won't take long! Once you've found the leak, then you can decide how you want to fix it. Loctite has a marine epoxy that works well and sets fairly quickly, you can find it at Wal-Mart."
201624,Scott S,2008-05-14 16:04:00,203,Thanks for your help guys. I can only get at the bottom of the boat. So it look's like I will fiil it up with water and see if it leaks out the bottom!! Scooter
201667,Pinch,2008-05-14 18:00:00,231, I think its called gravity!
