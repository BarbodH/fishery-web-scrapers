So I thought to myself, now that's a tough job to do, but I better see if I can please the wife   ... Other than the black flies, the morning was awesome.....tried worms, spinners and spoons for a while but with no success so after an hour I decided to bring out the fly rod and BANG!!!....all were caught on flies  ...... here's some pics to share..         And here's my honey's dinner ready to be cooked!!  "

200942,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-05-13 10:20:00,1362, They're all Brookies ehg....you can usually tell if it's a Brook trout by its tail....also referred to as square tail..  Here's a pic of some Splake....you see more of a fork in the tail but not as much as a Laker and not as square as a Brookie..
