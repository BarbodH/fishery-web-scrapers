201177,bpsbassman,2008-05-13 18:59:00,941,HOLD ON ROY!!!!!!!!!!! Congrats on the new ride!
201283,Zubris21,2008-05-13 23:13:00,563,"I've got some walleye in the freezer, now I know how they'll be cooked!  thanks!"
201307,Tomcat,2008-05-13 23:42:00,395,Congrats on the new horses! You'll have to let us know how you like the new 60 on your boat.
200949,Roy,2008-05-13 11:00:00,13728,Last night I had the last of my walleye. I tried the bacon wrapped method for a change. Quite decent...added a coupla filet mignons with it and it was poifect. Now I'm allowed to keep a fish or two when I get out there.    I spose that this weekend will be the last time I waltz with the 2 stroke so I'll try to give it a good send off. Fish are at 28-29 FOW here now and biting lightly.  Be well.
200952,Chris,2008-05-13 11:03:00,405,"Gee Roy, I just finished breakfeat and now you got me droooolling."
200962,Greencoachdog,2008-05-13 11:25:00,8163,Get yer azz out there and get some fish!!!!... and don't make me have to tell you twice!
200967,jediangler,2008-05-13 11:30:00,1923,"Mmmm...tasty, I'll vouch for the bacon wrap method. Works good with perch too."
200968,mattyk,2008-05-13 11:33:00,2110,lookin real good!
200974,lew,2008-05-13 11:42:00,12767," Supper looks awesome Roy, but what's this about the trusty old Mariner ??  Is there sumthin new in the works ??"
200979,John,2008-05-13 11:46:00,2956, You hungry or havin' a party going down? Someone buying you a new motor?
200981,Greencoachdog,2008-05-13 11:49:00,8163,I think he got a new 60 H.P. 4 stroke for Mothers Day...
200982,Roy,2008-05-13 11:49:00,13728,"Thanks Lew, yeah, I bought a 60hp four stroke on Friday night. They will install it on Tuesday next. And. on your advice, got a Minn-Kota Edge bowmount. I got the 70lb 24 volt model."
200985,Greencoachdog,2008-05-13 11:56:00,8163,  I'd pay BIG money for a video of you operating that trolling motor for the first time!!!  ... don't forget to wear your 5 point safety harness when you fire that sucker up for the first time!
200986,lew,2008-05-13 11:56:00,12767,"WTG Roy, that's alot of great news there Bud !!!!  Yer gonna be very happy with that 4 stroke  and I'm pretty sure you'll like that MinnKota too  Very happy for ya !!"
200994,RangerGuy,2008-05-13 12:17:00,564,"<insert homer groan here> bacon LOL!  Your gonna love the new trolling motor, I can't comment on the 4 stroke I'm still driving old smokey LOL! But Ilove having the new Terrova it's a great motor you'll see a huge difference in battery longevity."
201000,Mike the Pike,2008-05-13 12:31:00,3421,If you need a fishing partner to go and try out the new toys I am only 20 minutes away.  Now that boat is going to fly.    Didn't know you wanted to replace this electric motor.    Oh and do you think the hat will stay on with the 60hp.  congrats Roy woo hoo double the power.  MTP
201007,Zubris21,2008-05-13 12:56:00,563,any special prep needed for the bacon wrapped walleye?  or just wrap and cook?  it looks delicious!
201022,Joey,2008-05-13 13:44:00,9122,Well that seems like its an awefull waste of time driving all the way down to the States for some Walleye.  Why not just hang around here and catch some pickerel hon  Can't wait to see the motor hon.  Sounds like a good buy.  Joey
201065,nautifish,2008-05-13 15:10:00,1416,Conrats on the new Motor Roy.  That fish looks realy tastey.
201069,wuchikubo,2008-05-13 15:18:00,1114,Roy get out there and catch a few and remember to bring the cam and OFC tourney banner!
201074,Mike01,2008-05-13 15:23:00,378,"I'm also curious about this bacon wrapped method.  I've never heard of it before, but it looks really good."
201094,Roy,2008-05-13 15:55:00,13728,"Mike and FWF, I just wrapped the walleye chunks. Lotsa folks add spices, herbs and sauces but I like the taste of walleye too much to add anything else. Even the bacon takes away from the fish."
201102,Mike01,2008-05-13 16:14:00,378,cool....i'll have to try that on the weekend
201107,highdrifter,2008-05-13 16:18:00,2534,"mmmmm.. scrumpdiddlyumptious Roy.  A meal fit for a king, or root administrator..  Remember, glutiny is a sin!  HD"
201108,Smokey,2008-05-13 16:31:00,1278,Looks tasty Roy and congrats on the new motor.  Mike
201122,Carp,2008-05-13 17:07:00,1488,Mmmm! Now I have the itch to get a few walleye & a pack of bacon.  Congrats on the motor upgrade. The 4 stroke is something I'm sure you will truly appreciate.
201143,rob v,2008-05-13 17:48:00,535,"I tired the bacon wrap method once also - but I found that the bacon didn't cook nearly as fast as the walleye - perhaps the bacon should be pre-cooked somewhat .. say 1/2 cooked ... so after wrapping the fish with it by the time the fish is cooked the bacon would be as well ?   Haven,t had a chance to do it again since."
201171,misfish,2008-05-13 18:46:00,29133,"Nice looking feed Roy. What,s ya going to do with the old 2 stroke?"
