199959,splashhopper,2008-05-11 19:03:00,2931,"ok.. so with the help from a few guys here... I caught 2 bows on Friday night.. put em in the fridge.  then caught another one Saturday afternoon... fried em up with a nice cajun rub about 30 minutes later right there at the hole. ( some young guys had camped in the woods there overnight and had a cast iron pan and oil!  Thought ok, that solves THAT little dilemna.  Just be done in by a dang nail in my tire when  icame out of the hole at 9PM Saturday night! Lucky for me one of the guys i was with had a portable tire inflator in his trunk .  Oh well, Long weekend next weekend, so... gonna fish for crappies and drop backs..."
200365,cranks bait,2008-05-12 11:21:00,721,"I guess I should come clean.  I caught and kept a bass back in November (closing day).  I froze it for a later date.  Needless to say, it is still in the freezer, (wifes saving it for a special day?)  Does this mean I am in violation of the law?"
201320,Pinch,2008-05-14 00:07:00,231," No it was legally caught.  You weren't, (I assume) over the limit at the time.  It may be OOS now, but it wasn't at the time.  Theres a difference between OOS and over the limit."
197941,dwc67,2008-05-07 14:01:00,140,smoke em that day. then they are prepared and no longer in your  limit for the next day
197946,Stoty,2008-05-07 14:06:00,2910," THATS TOTAL Bull if you ask me. If I want to take a picture of a fish, I will. I would also GLADLY take that charge to court.  How are people without cradle's or a big enough net supposed to remove the lure from a musky? Just grab the lure with the pliers and go to town?!?! Thats really good for the fish!  Get charged for taking a picture...hahaha...i have heard it all now."
197979,bigfish1965,2008-05-07 15:28:00,3382,"The CO's interpretation is irrelevant. It is the JP's interpretation that matters. There has never been a successful conviction for anyone quickly taking a picture and releasing the fish other wise anyone caught taking a pic of a musky or walleye or pike out of the slot would be guilty of the same charge. You can't tell if a fish is in or out of slot until you measure it...but it comes under the same law..possession of fish. As far as transporting through districts with different limits, it is up to the Co to prove you were in violation. Having a reasonable story like coming from an area with an all year season or different limits removes the possibility."
198025,Casey123,2008-05-07 16:42:00,461," I think everyone is misunderstanding the point of the question!!!!  This is how I interperte what you are asking....  If the water you are fishing has a 2 limit possesion then it is a 2 limit possesion, gone are the days of daily and agragate possesion limits.  So if you catch 2 on Friday, that is it for keeping them.  You can continue C and R BUT if you stick 2 in your freezer up there and take 2 more home to London you are in violation of the law.  Your total possesion limit is now 4, 2 over the limit.  You may get away with it, but you are still breaking the law, knowling doing so is even worse.  Now if you were fishing on Friday in lake Huron with a two possesion limit then on Satuday moved to a body of water that had a 5 possesion limit you would be entitled to catch an additional 3 fish without breaking the law.  The daily limit is the same as the total possesion limit you are allowed to have."
198066,fishinggeek,2008-05-07 18:17:00,325,"   I agree.  I think some people mistakenly believe a CO or police officer's words are law.  They are law enforcers, not legal experts.  If a law enforcement officer says it's illegal, it is not necessarily illegal.  And if an officer lays a charge, it doesn't mean one has committed an offence.  Like Stoty, I would have no hesitation in taking a picture of an OOS fish, fish within the slot limit, fish accidentally caught whose species is prohibited from all angling, etc., even in front of a watching CO.  Not that I'm a rebel, but it certainly doesn't sound illegal to me and I would fight that charge in court.  Of course, I would respectfully not post the picture on here as our mods have politely asked us to refrain from doing so.   In another thread, someone asked what happens if one is unhooking an OOS fish and someone else takes a picture of it.  Same act, same intention (i.e. taking a picture of an OOS fish) yet there's no way the latter could get a successful conviction."
198090,Fishnfiend,2008-05-07 19:04:00,357, I like the way that your mind works.
