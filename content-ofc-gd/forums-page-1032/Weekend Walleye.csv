Once again a shout out to the staff at Fosters Fishing Center for providing excellent service throughout the weekend!  My girlfriend and I were picked up in Kingston by another couple around 6:30am on Friday morning.  Got to the campsite and immediately got the boat in the water.  We headed out into the bay around 7:45 for our first day of fishing.  Day 1 was by far the most productive.  We caught 8 fish before 11, including this 24.5 incher for the tournament.    My friend also had a couple nice ones in the morning including this beauty...    but most of them were nice eating sizes.  We ended up keeping 3 smaller Eyes and had a nice shore lunch before setting up camp.  We fried the fish in some seasoned breadcrumbs and butter.  It was delicious, no special batter or spices, just the seasoned breadcrumbs!  This weekend was great as it gave us a chance to test out one of our newest toys.  This new MEC Lightfield tent was great for the cold nights, and we're sure to be getting lots of use out of it this summer...    Unfortunately the fishing kinda slowed for the rest of the weekend.  We were only able to double our number from the first morning and the trip ended with 16 walleye landed, and a couple which shook the hook right at the surface.  Countless perch and what I think were white perch were caught and it made it difficult to keep the crawlers on the worm harnesses for any length of time.  My girlfriend eventually got fed up with replacing her worm, so she decided to put on the new Berkley Gulp imitation worm.  Wouldn't you know it, as soon as she hit bottom the fish of the weekend strikes.  She landed this fat walleye after a nice little fight.  Here she is posing with her trophy fish in an OFC hat I had made for the tournament entries.  (unfortunately she's not a member of the site so this one wont be in the tournament.)  No measure or weight on this one since it was a quick release, but we estimated around 9lbs.    The weather was great, and once again the staff and facilities at Fosters Fishing were second to none.  No HUGE fish landed this year, but enough fun to ensure we'll be back again next year."
