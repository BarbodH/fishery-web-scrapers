The steelhead season started out a little slow for me in the fall, but quickly picked up once the temps got down enough to keep all but fools (me) off the river. The browns kept me busy for a while while the trout were getting ready for the beating I was about to lay on them. First fish of the winter season came on a red roe bag in a little run that I like to call dead man's wall (Dont ask).    Not long after I nailed a big fat female brown just down stream.    Then it was time for me to graduate in the steelheading world, I picked up my first pin and the first trip out the spawn out brown was willing to take my green roe bag in SUPER chocolately water...    The browns were ferocious for a while, I dont get alot of pictures because I fish solo most of the time so that is just a small sampling. After the browns slowed down it was time for the steel. First drift of 2008!    And the rest of that day went something like this...        and dinner went like this...    The action was hot for the month of January whenever the ice wasn't impossible to fish through.  February started with a bang with this nice hen...    and her friends were hungry too!    This guy got a little fiesty and decided to slap me. I probably deserved it.   This is the same day      I have a bit of a gap until about the end of march, was catching fish but it was WAY too cold to take solo pics... anyways I worked about 2 hours for this fish.    It was around this time when I started making my own jigs, and most of the steel from this point on were taken on my patterns including this big guy that was fooled by ""the flirt""    THE FLIRT   There seem to be a lot of pictures missing, Ill have to search my computer as I think I neglected to write a few reports including a PB that I had thought i posted but is not in my gallery...  anyways here is the opening weekend, Ill just say that it was a blast and this is only a fraction of the fish I caught!                And thats a wrap! Ill search for the pics of the HOG and some others that I nailed in the winter Im sure they are here somewhere. It was a great season and I got out alot, I was also honoured to have shared a drift with many board members this winter including DouG, Bly, CCMT and more. This was the last year for me to really get out alot as I am a new student at the university of Guelph starting this fall. Thanks to everyone who ever helped me with steelheading, if it wasn't for this board this report would never have been possible!  TIGHTLINES!"
