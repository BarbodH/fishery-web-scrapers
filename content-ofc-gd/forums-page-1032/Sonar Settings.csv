As a general rule, I think chart speed/ping speed should be on high unless you are still fishing.  If your running down the lake you can be on auto depth and sensitivity.  When fishing the shallows... Set the depth to something that is reasonable...In a 6-7 foot deep bay you don't need information about anything more than 10 feet deep. If you trolling a DT10, who cares if there are fish at 60 feet?  Always turn the sensitivity down in shallow water. If you don't the surface will be cluttered with rebound noise. To find the right settings, watch your screen. When the surface begins to clear and the Billion little spots in the water column fade away you're there."
