201235,nancur373,2008-05-13 21:46:00,1211,Can anyone tell me roughly what year this motor is?   
201236,Gerritt,2008-05-13 21:47:00,6129,do you have the serial number?  G
201237,nancur373,2008-05-13 21:52:00,1211,not yet...thinking about buying it but the owner doesn't know the age. he bought it last year.
201246,Gerritt,2008-05-13 22:05:00,6129,Looks old.. what are you picking it up for if you don't mind... if you could get the serial from him you can easily find it's year on the net..  G
201249,nancur373,2008-05-13 22:13:00,1211,150.00. He wanted 225.00
201251,Gerritt,2008-05-13 22:20:00,6129,"If it works that is a good deal... but be sure to check the compression and the lower end... my bet is it would be difficult to find seals (??) if it does leak... also what shape is the impeller in? can you get a new one?  But for 150.00 if a lasts a year or two you're ahead I figure..  Just be sure to have paddles or a radio incase of failure to be safe  My bet would be late 60's, early 70's?  Bernie might have a better idea when he sees this post... but it will be had to nail down the year without the model & serial..  G"
201252,DanTheMan,2008-05-13 22:20:00,257,"Get the model # and check here bud  http://www.obparts.com/years/johnson60.html  Dont want to sound rude, but 150 to 200 is   bit high for that age?? Unless she runs like a cadillac"
201258,nancur373,2008-05-13 22:30:00,1211,Thanks DTM
201265,lew,2008-05-13 22:42:00,12767,"I could be wrong, but IMHO I think your taking quite a chance on buying a motor that's probably close to 40 years old.  Personally, I'd save the $150 myself and wait till you can afford something that would probably be more reliable.......just my opinion though."
201335,boatman,2008-05-14 00:33:00,350,"1959 Johnson QD-20 10 hp.  It is a great motor. $150 is reasonable if it runs well. Don't be scared by these old motors. I have dozens of motors older than this one and they run beautifully. Lots of torque and power. It'll push you around 20 mph.  All consumable parts are still available and relatively cheap. The lower unit will likely need to be re-sealed. The kit is about $30. The impeller is $20-30. Check the coils before you buy it. If they are origninal they MUST be replaced even if they spark well. New coils are about $20 each aftermarket or $35 each from your dealer. If you have to completely tune-up the motor it will cost you $150-200 in parts. However, it will be an incredibly good running and reliable motor.  PS. Don't pay $150 unless you see it run."
201345,Woodsman,2008-05-14 01:04:00,1286,Late 50's early 60's. Model # will tell you. QD-17 = 1956 QD-24 = 1963 The numeral part of the model # raises one digit per year.  The 9.5 hp replaced the 10 hp for 1964.
201348,boatman,2008-05-14 01:12:00,350,Its a 1959 QD-20. I gaurantee it.
201366,nancur373,2008-05-14 01:44:00,1211,thanks guys
