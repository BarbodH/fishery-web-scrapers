199995,Joey,2008-05-11 20:17:00,9122,"Well I seemed to feel a bit better today after being dogged by strep throat all week, so we decided to head out for some Simcoe Pike.  The weather seemed okay earlier on, but the wind turned quite nasty.  Paul ended up catching 2 OOS smallies and a pike for his team and I caught one smallie.  No pics or weight/length of the smallies as they are out of season so were just released at boatside, but let me tell you, these things were monsters.  Biggest I've seen on Simcoe.  Here's Paul's pike - 25 inches for his team.     A few more shots to show how the wind was a pain.  I almost lost my Tony Stewart hat several times   .  Had to pull my hair through the back.      Nice to get out tho.  Maybe the weather will be nicer next weekend.  Happy Mother's day to all  Joey"
200040,mattyk,2008-05-11 21:43:00,2110,thanks for the report!
200056,irishfield,2008-05-11 22:07:00,26272,Great stuff hon ! Great smiles.. both of you !
200059,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-11 22:12:00,0,Simcoe is a crappy place to fish when it is really windy! But at least you caught some fish.Thats a healthy looking pike.
200302,Mike the Pike,2008-05-12 02:50:00,3421,Thanks for the minnie report Joey looks like you enjoyed yourself .  I also caught a 25 inch pike for my team and a nice OOS smallie.  
200312,Skud,2008-05-12 03:08:00,739,"I was out there also this morning. I had my butt kicked by the wind trying to get my boat on the trailer on the Gilford side. Had to take refuge in the marina and load my boat up there. Caught a 32"" pike only today. Yesturday I landed 5 pike all around 28""."
200317,Crazyhook,2008-05-12 03:15:00,1154,my favorite couple!  nice outing guys! great way to spend the day
200528,ccmtcanada,2008-05-12 15:30:00,7971,Great stuff Joey...but there is something odd about the report.  Paul is holding a fish and you aren't...LOL.  Guess you have to let him catch a few so he'll keep going out eh?
200536,LeXXington,2008-05-12 15:54:00,1928,"Great going, Paul..  25"" pike is a nice little start"
200541,Roy,2008-05-12 16:15:00,13728,"WTG Paul! Nice of you to take the captain of another team fishing. Paul, did you know that 15% of our opposing captains wear lipstick?"
201419,Crazyhook,2008-05-14 03:22:00,1154,Roy... you notice everything!
