Anything over 2.5 mph they run with a really tight side to side motion maybe 1 inch max to each side. I've played with the eyelets, I've tried wider, rounder leader snap clips both steel/titanium and floro material, also tried split rings on the eyelet that I'd attach to the leader.  What it should look like http://www.driftertackle.com/products/believer-video.php  They run fine until I go anything over 2.5 m.p.h. I doubt the Believer in the video is going faster then 2.5 mph.  Is this tight running action desired?  I have this problem with 2 out of my 3 - 8'' jointed flavours, the only good one has a squirrelly tail.  Any suggestions?  Thanks in advance"
490926,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-03 18:38:00,0,As long as it doesnt roll out its running fine. They run better under 4 mph anyway.
490928,lew,2010-08-03 18:50:00,12766,"And also the bigger the bait, the wider the wobble.  I normally run the 10"" models which have a fairly wide action, but I also use 13"" versions(straight) and they cover twice as much ground again.  Excellent trolling baits !!"
