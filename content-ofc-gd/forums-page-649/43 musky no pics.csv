490402,johnl,2010-08-02 01:46:00,197,I got a nice 43'' musky on scugog yesterday.The only pics are on my buddy's phone ill try to get them to post them.My buddy's got 3 walleyes and a bass all were released.I had a smaller musky on but it jumped and spit the lure and another big one took a swipe at my lure but may have just bumped it with her nose.The musky's were on the $30 kong perch.The walleye and bass were on a tail dancer and a live target bluegill.We were only out for about 2 and a half hours so not a bad trip.It was overcast and from about 5:30 to 8pm.

Also love how musky lures are referenced by their price, not size  "
