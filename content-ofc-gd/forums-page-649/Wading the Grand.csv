490627,Mike Pike,2010-08-02 21:20:00,1332,"What a glorious summer morning!  Packed the waders, fishing vest, rod and tackle in the trunk last night so I could get away nice and early this morning.  Made it to the Grand River in the Caledonia area right at sun up and started to drift the river for Smallmounth( or anything else that would take my bait ).  The river was still pretty murky from our recent rains with only a few inches of visibility.  Looks way nicer in the picture.  lol    Not a big fan of wading the river with so little vis and took it pretty easy.  Don't like getting dunked even if it's such a warm day.  Finally got this pale little 14-incher to take my worm.  A nice fight and then released.      And what would a morning fishing the Grand be without a visit from the World's Greatest Sportfish!  Notice how pale it is too.  It's amazing how quickly the fish get light coloured  when the river gets stained with the rains.    Things quited down so I changed locations and the species changed too.  My first Kitty this year and a nice surprise.      Nothing huge today but still a great way to spend a holiday morning.  "
490633,bushart,2010-08-02 21:37:00,2628,Thanks very much for the pics Mike  Memory lane---I cut my fishin teeth in Calendonia.
490652,Mike Pike,2010-08-02 22:44:00,1332,I know you did Bushart.  I remember your some of your posts.  And didn't you do a painting of that old white building just down from the dam?
490653,splashhopper,2010-08-02 22:45:00,2931,nice pics
490659,vinnimon,2010-08-02 23:05:00,2593,This one? I would love to see a pic of the painting one day!   
490663,Mike Pike,2010-08-02 23:12:00,1332,"Yup, that's the building.  I'm pretty sure Bushart painted it.  If I remember correctly, it was done as he remembered it as a child.  Or am I thinking of something else?"
490671,vinnimon,2010-08-02 23:25:00,2593,"  If he did paint it,I would surely like to see it indeed!Thats  the exact  spot where I got hooked on fishing when I was a tot,thanks to my Dad and Uncles! Pees off my Mom and wife that Im always busy with some important things to do! Like,FISHING OF COARSE!"
490679,bigugli,2010-08-02 23:45:00,6138,"sounds like a great morning to me. Fresh air, sunny skies and a little this and that can't be that bad?"
490708,bushart,2010-08-03 00:56:00,2628,"Hi Guys,  Yeah I painted one from memory a while ago---a little artistic licence from my youth.  Thanks Again  "
490711,vinnimon,2010-08-03 01:04:00,2593,"  excelent work bushart. I may be driving threw there tomorrow,in that will take a pic for you,from that same exact spot!"
490720,Mike Pike,2010-08-03 01:28:00,1332,"Beautiful , Bushart, just beautiful.  Thanks for that.  Funny, but I remember when you posted that a while back and have never forgotten it.  Just a really neat scene( memory )that you captured.  Thank you."
490751,ehg,2010-08-03 03:26:00,2666,Great post! I like that kind of fishing
490833,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-03 14:55:00,932,"Awesome Report Mike - that's the kind of fishing I love and I do it 4-5 times per week (including yesterday!)  Nice to see you got into a few, even in low vis.  And to Bushart - that is a great picture - beautiful.  Thanks for sharing."
490849,Mike Pike,2010-08-03 15:32:00,1332,You're lucky especially living where you do and all those rivers!  Good on ya.
490880,cuzza,2010-08-03 17:06:00,467,"Nice report Mike, had my first outing on the Grand at Paris on Saturday and connected with a few smallies on the fly and the water was murky then too, looking forward to going back when the level is back down again."
490886,Mike Pike,2010-08-03 17:24:00,1332,Good you connected your first time out and in those conditions.  Paris is a neat place to fish because there are a few good places downtown to have a bite and refreshments afterwards.  Goodluck on your next trip.
491179,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-04 03:51:00,932," Yep, I'm just a stone's throw away from good browns and good smallies (though I tone down the browns after bass opens for mortality rate reasons).  I'm looking forward to getting a few September browns before the season ends though.  I'll have to try and get down to Caledonia at some point this season and see what kind of SMB I can get into.  Got a few more on the rivers tonight, but nothing to brag about this time (big guy tonight was 14"" though I saw an abnormally large snapping turtle who swam right up to me and hung out beside me for 5 minutes.  He even did this lean back thing and stuck his head out of the water . . . strange).  Ryan"
491302,Guest JPCT,2010-08-04 17:53:00,0,Very nice. The grand is a beautiful river.
