There are several of us that are avid fishermen who are looking to rent a boat for the week to have for fishing and taking rides with the wives and kids around the lake (larger vessel, pontoon boat perhaps) Wondering if anyone would know where I could get a hold of a boat on the lake? I have inquired about it at Taits marina and Glenwood resort.  Wondering if there is anywhere else, even in Parry Sound where I could get a rental? Any and all help would be appreciated."

I have also rented them from the marina at the dam in Hurdville ,again I think they were mostly the smaller ones. Your best bet might be Gordon Bay marine or Georgian Bay marina in Parry Sound. Not sure if they would let you trailer the boats away thou."
