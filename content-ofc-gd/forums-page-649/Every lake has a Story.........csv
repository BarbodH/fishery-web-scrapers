490387,jediangler,2010-08-01 23:58:00,1923,"Great report and pics 24/7. Quebec is probably the best place to catch big bass in Canada. I see lots if giant smallies caught in Q on the Yakfishing.net site too. One WARNING though. That pic where all your rods are propped up against the tree trunk. I realize that's the best way to protect them from getting stepped on but if the weather turns ugly, lay them down somewhere safe away from the trees. I had 3 rods leaning like that on an old white pine, 15yrs ago while camping on the Bonnechere River near Barry's Bay. A thunderstorm blew in and the tree was struck by lightning. Two of my rods exploded when the current travelled through them, blowing the resin off and leaving only graphite fibres. They looked like horsetails with reel seats. The 3rd rod was fiberglass and was knocked over but still in perfect condition. Oh ya, and the reels on the zapped rods had all the grease and oil burned off and the handles were welded in and couldn't be removed."

490169,Fishing 24/7,2010-08-01 00:27:00,709,"Remember This ????    Yeah Thats my 5,6 lbs LMB And thats Where im Heading!  Camped In a PRIME large mouth bass location.......  Thats my idea of a fish'n trip.  As we all know. This year bass fishing is totally different.  you adapt..... or you dont catch nothing.  last year it was all about surface.  frogs, buzz, jitterbug and whatever........  But this year the weeds are gone.... they didnt grow in many of the lakes i fish.....  yeah there some..... but not thick like last year.  So the bass have moved.... That was my mission this week.  and let me tell you guys.... i did not fail. 8)  When a pro bass fisherman tells you.  i have a spot dude........ i pulls out nickel after nickel after nickel...  well this story has 3 of them.... 5.3 lbs , 5.6 lbs , 5.10 lbs and a seriouse 6.5 lbs  But lets start this one slow and easy!  Day 1.  Stephanie helped me pack last night.    The perfect start for a week to remember.  Me , My COUZ , mike  and my brother jason.  were to camp on a island .... not any island....  PIG FREAKING FACTORY ISLAND.  We get there and start to set up.    My weapons      Our home.  After setting up.  Fish time.  We start the week slow.  Mike with a nice bass....    He's not used to the E.A.P. but dont worry he will learn quick.  The windy day makes it hard to locate the fish so we wait for the wind to die down...  we fished from 7pm to 9pm.  These were the two biggest we got that night.       Day 2  All primed up for the day of fish'n ahead of us.....  But the brutal 25 km/h winds had other plans.  Me and mike decide to go for a quick outting in the back bays.  nothing to prove in this bay. 1-2 lbs bass hitting here and there.  As we are comming back.  We spot a flipped canoe.  :shock:  STORM to the scene...  they had there life jackets on THANK GOD!  flip the canoe and grip the two HUMANS aboard and to safety we go.  10 000 thanks later we head back to the island.  wait for the wind to die down....  sun had passed the horison.  Jason and I were up for the night bite this time.  Out of ALL the lures i have Jason sets up a Hula POPPER! :shock:    We hit a shore line and a SERIOUSE explosion/ IMplosion catches my eye.  Jason sets the hook ....  His first nickel EVER!  a 5,3lbs LARGE MOUTH BEAST!    He was shaking like a Leaf spring.  Made for a good night of party and celebrations  CONGRATS BROTHER!  8)    day 3  i packed the boat today.  adrenaline to the max.    Cowboy gets a nice 2 lbs bass.    Today a reaction bait worked best.  BIG-O  spinnerbaits buzzbaits.  No size but some seriouse action.  This bass Freaked me OUT!  :shock:    He had a Pintch.......  Was a good day but ended quick sadly.  with the wind picking up.  and it did not stop through the night.  coudnt get out for the night bite. :cry:  Day 4  This day was Overall the best day of fishing we had.  Ryan and I,  go out for the  ''morning''  bite...... at 9-10 am    Sweet pigness.  i decide to hit a New shore line.  The best hit of the week.  As the bait landed in the water the bass opened its mouth and it was FISH ON!    But that was not the best part of the day......  Jason and I.... night bite...... 8 pm........  Cast here cast there....  -Jason     ( Big one )   - me   ( C'mon man stop  :shock:  around you lil  :shock:  )   -Jason ( Get the net BRO!!!!!!!)  The fish jumps  - me  (HOLY HOG)    I could not believe my EYES!  ANOHTER NICKEL!  im thinking this is IMPOSSIBLE MAN!  What are the ODDs ????    A seriouse 5.10 lbs bass in the boat AGAIN!    After all the excitment i finaly get the time to throw in my YUM.  a bass picks it up....    3 ish...    Jason ended the night with this one....  He was scared of all the bass we were getting.    I was dumbfounded and jason was like...  dude.  nickel are easy to catch man!  WHAT EVER KID!  day 5  This  day will be tattooed in my head for a long time.  Theres a place called.  '' the hump''    it produces ALL THE TIME.  but today it was on FIRE!  we must have pulled something like 50 -60 bass in 2 houres.  SMASHING your rod right out of your hands.  thats how they hit there.  UNBELIEVABLE.    Tonight bass was on the menu.    As the sun was setting i knew.  Prime Time....  every lake has a story.  Bernard the guy we launch from.  told us.... i caught a 6 1/2 largie around the small island right infront of the one you guys are camping from.  NOW... i know..... with these old schools....   you take some and you leave some.......  Well since he told me that iv been hitting this island every day 5-6 times.  But tonight was the night.  As we are going around the island.  There is only about 10 minutes left of sunlight.  im casting big-o  jason is using yum...  and mike has an OLD , BROKEN CHEAP canadian tire spinnerbait.....  with half the skirt missing and there WILLOW LEAF FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.  Mike caught her....  None THE LESS.  Take a deep Breath.  and enjoi the scenery.    22 inches.  16 inches of girth.    Our 2 lbs bass looked like minnows  :shock:    Dropped the scale at 6.5 lbs.  HANDS DOWN BRUTE!!!!!!  Well sadly mike didnt want a replica.  so she will get stuffed .  Ended this trip With some heavy fish.  Seems like last years 4'S  Grew into this years 5's  and the 6....  well thats just out of this world.  i need some counseling......  anyone know of a good SHRINK???"
