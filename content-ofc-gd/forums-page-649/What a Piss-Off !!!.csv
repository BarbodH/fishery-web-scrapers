490575,Beans,2010-08-02 19:13:00,3339,"I know...I know...we don't own the spots we fish but...  Sunday mornings 'till noon, Crappieperchhunter and I usually carp fish at Carp Point (he and the missus go garage saleing on Saturdays) but this weekend there was a bloody great houseboat tied up right in front of where we set-up both yesterday and today...  Yesterday around 05:00pm Maribeth and I drove by and there was nothing there and Steve drove by at 07:00 pm and nada so we figure we are good to ""go""...I even sent Jack (Nanook) an e-mail stating same as he likes to drop by and watch and shoot the bull...  I feel sorry more for Steve not getting to wet a line this weekend (working stiff) and for Jack making the trip over for nothing than I do for myself as I can go anytime...as some of us know Jack is not in the best of health at present so I hope the trip was not too tiring on him...I waited around for a while hoping to catch up to him but Mother Nature called and I was damned if I was going to pay $2 to park the truck just to use their washroom at the locks so I headed back home...  Oh well...the lawns needed cutting...end of rant !!!        "
490583,bassjnkie,2010-08-02 19:31:00,1101,That sucks. Sorry to hear that.
490585,splashhopper,2010-08-02 19:34:00,2931,well if that was a rant? I would hate to see you upset!   lol
490605,Photoz,2010-08-02 20:24:00,792,"Geeeee . . . .    wouldn't it have been a bugger  if that big ol' tub wasn't tied too well, and during the night the damn knots came untied . . . . .   ? Woulda been a cryin' shame?"
490609,crappieperchhunter,2010-08-02 20:34:00,2582,"Yeah no fishing for me this weekend. I might be a grumpy bugger to work with this week  I have not been talking to Nanook. I hope you didn't make the drive over for nothing Jack.  5 or 6 years we have been fishing the same swim and this is the first time anyone has ever anchored right in our spot, except for the month a couple of summers ago when they had a barge there working on the lines in front of the dam."
490640,Nanook,2010-08-02 21:54:00,565,"Yeah ! I made the trip Ok, but no-body home!! Wont be making a date with you two Guy's anytime soon I should have known I guess, the Locks at Buckhorn were jam packed. Was'nt wasted trip, went on to see a sick friend. There'll be another time Buddies"
490643,Beans,2010-08-02 21:58:00,3339, Way back in my drinking days I woulda thought like Photoz and cut the lines...guess I've been restored to some sense of sanity...   
490649,splashhopper,2010-08-02 22:38:00,2931, I like your kind of sanity Beans
490681,crappieperchhunter,2010-08-02 23:55:00,2582," Sorry to hear you wasted your gas Jack. I walked over from the cottage at 6:45 to see the houseboat there.  No phone or internet at the cottage to warn you,so I just prayed today wasn't the day you where going to come for a visit.  Beansie and I are always glad when you join us. I hope you try again another Sunday...or better yet...a weekday when I am up on holidays in a couple of weeks. Pencil in Aug 16-20 on your calender. A lot less boat traffic through the week."
490691,HTHM,2010-08-03 00:08:00,4082,"Try throwing him off of your boat in the middle of May. He comes up sputtering and says, ""Well that was interesting"""
490904,Beans,2010-08-03 17:55:00,3339,I like your kind of sanity Beans  Fishing is my Mental Health Therapy...
