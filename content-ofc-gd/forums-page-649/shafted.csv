Well when I stick it on the new hull it's 4"" short. the cavitation plate is that far up the transom. can anyone suggest a fix for this issue. I'm kinda stuck limited funds now . my plan was to run the 18 till I had more cash for bigger motor. I'm not going to cut down the transom either.  is there a jack plate or trolling mount that might get me by for a bit  I need help"
490857,Fisherman,2010-08-03 15:55:00,7201,"There are such things as jack plates that afford some height adjustment.  Most 14' boats usually come with a 15"" transom, give or take an inch.  Measure twice, buy once.  They show one here: http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product_10151_-1_10001_1148____SearchResults"
490867,DRIFTER_016,2010-08-03 16:45:00,10439,Yeah for a few hundred $$$$ you can buy yourself a manual jack plate and use that. You can continue to use it with the new motor as well. It will allow you to set your motor height perfectly for best performance. They will also set your motor a little bit further back which will actually make your boat handle as if it were a little longr as well.  Cabelas Jack Plates   The Mini Jacker from BPS is probably your cheapest option though.  Mini Jacker
