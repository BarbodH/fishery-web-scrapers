There's a park across the street from Billings Avenue on Riverside Drive...while heading south on Bank take a left after the bridge  MILLIONS of 'em ... never bought worms while living in OT.

They work just as well and will last a lot longer on the hook than a worm.  You won't have to re-bait near as often."

Check Fish-hawk web site forums who are located in Ottawa.  http://www.fish-hawk.net/hawktalk/  Go down to - Fish-Hawk Marketplace  Most sponsors should sell what you are looking for.  carp-starter  - good luck"
