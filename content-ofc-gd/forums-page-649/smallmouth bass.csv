490546,lakeman,2010-08-02 17:49:00,19,"Just wondering,  how many of my fishing friends here on site... have ever caught a 21 inch long,  small mouth bass on an inland lake....how long do these fish get usually....thanks for your info.....I landed one on the week-end.!!.."
490556,timmeh,2010-08-02 18:14:00,609,"That is a very decent sized bass for any inland body of water, lake or river. Most smallies will not get that big. If you're on Simcoe or Erie then you may find a few more that size.  For me personally, mostly fishing the rivers and smaller lakes, I consider anything over 20"" a real beauty, and anything over 17"" is a nice smallie. And I'm talking about actual measured fish, not best guesses."
490557,splashhopper,2010-08-02 18:18:00,2931," Congrats .. any pics of yours?  Here are two of my biggest smallies to date   23"" smallie on an inland lake   25"" smallie on another inland lake "
490560,mercman,2010-08-02 18:36:00,7054,"sheesh, we have the same guides, and i never seen a smallie that big.back to the drawing board"
490566,lakeman,2010-08-02 18:53:00,19,"sorry...no pics as  i was fishing alone, this time figured if i did catch anything, would be awfully hard to keep the fish still!! and take pic at same time..Bob Izumu never saw any action like a had with this baby...first my line got tangled around the drum meaning i couldnt reel in..!!...second  i heard big splash as she tried to spit the hook she was behind me..and the motor..not an easy position to be in,when your in a scanoe.!!.......3rd  as she wrapped her self round my anchor rope, i had to quickly put my rod under the anchor rope and hold tension on the line, with the other hand..!!  To crown it off, i quickly pulled her up as i struggled to keep tension on manually grabbed her by the bottom lip and hauled her aboard..by this time my heart was racing!!...One fish never to be forgotten!!"
490570,lakeman,2010-08-02 18:58:00,19, those are awsome fish must be from  lake simcoe..or Nipissing...beauties.!!!!! nice pics too.
490587,splashhopper,2010-08-02 19:39:00,2931, sounds like a blast and a well deserved landing ...  
490588,splashhopper,2010-08-02 19:40:00,2931, nope !  lol
490593,Fang,2010-08-02 19:54:00,1330,21 is kind of a magic number for smallies. I've got a couple 23's from lakes and my pb of a 23.5 maitland river fish. Long and skinny but one of the most acrobatic fights of my fishing catches
490595,vinnimon,2010-08-02 20:01:00,2593,"  Caught an 18 incher yesterday,sent him back to grow 3 more! Pics on its way in a bit."
490707,singingdog,2010-08-03 00:52:00,1047,"I believe there are a fair # of 20""+ smallies in any decent smallie lake. Finding them and catching them is a whole other thing. I rejoice at anything over 20""."
490709,Dutch,2010-08-03 01:01:00,831,"21"" smallies is a nice fish.  They fight like no other.  Largest I have caugt is right at 20"" just under 5 pounds."
490767,OhioFisherman,2010-08-03 08:30:00,6623,"Just observations, I have see a number of 20+ smallies from inland lakes and the same with largemouth, Chautauqua Lake in New York is a smallie factory, it can produce them up to 6 or 7 pounds and has been doing that since I was a kid. It`s just one of those lakes with the right mix for them. Water quality, depth, food supply, spawning areas, mix in a closed spawning season?  30 years of fishing bass tournaments and seeing weigh ins, some lakes have a history of being able to produce big fish, 5+ pounds, on others you can almost bet a 3 1/2 pounder or so will be big bass. A lot of lakes will produce numbers, seen a lot of tournaments won on inland lakes with 12-14 pounds for 5 fish. For me it was always more fun to fish lakes that you knew 18-22 was a decent day.  South of the border, smallies on inland lakes here aren`t all that rare, but big ones can be."
