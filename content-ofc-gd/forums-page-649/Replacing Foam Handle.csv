490530,Uncle Buck,2010-08-02 17:38:00,1000,"probably not worth the cost...  see about picking up some diawa heartland downrigger rods, they are priced very well... i use shimano TDRs and have had good luck with them... little bit more $$ then the heartlands, but not much..."
490538,Spiel,2010-08-02 17:43:00,9065,If you were closer to Hamilton I'd be happy to do it for you.  That aside the repair is not difficult if you're a handyman of sorts.  If you decide to to try it on your own I can direct you to the needed materials and instruct you through the process.
490700,fish-miester,2010-08-03 00:26:00,864,  was wondering on the aprox cost?
490781,Spiel,2010-08-03 11:10:00,9065, Well it can certainly vary but I'd say around $20.00 to $25.00 plus material costs.   
490791,Andy,2010-08-03 12:44:00,330,  Another possible option?  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product_10151_-1_10001_94037_100004000_100000000_100004000_100-4-0
490955,Scott S,2010-08-03 20:16:00,203,I would appreciate that Speil. Where can I get the material to replace the handle. I not sure if I qualify for a handyman but I'll give it a try!!! Thanks Scooter
491244,Spiel,2010-08-04 13:45:00,9065," That I'm not sure of, these days a get most of my stuff from the U.S.  But locally you might try Angling Specialties, 3 locations in the GTA.  Or perhaps this guy in London, Ont.  http://johnsflymaterials.webs.com/  Other than that I'd say Cabelas, I'm certain they'd have them.      "
491298,Uncle Buck,2010-08-04 17:34:00,1000,"a TDR is $45 at BPS, the heartland is even less...  why go through the hassle for $10 or $15?"
