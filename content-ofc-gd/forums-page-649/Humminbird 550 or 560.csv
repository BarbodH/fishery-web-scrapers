In all your collective general wisdom, is the 560 worth the extra $? With so many to choose from, 550, 560, 565, 570, etc... all in the similar price range I'm having a hard time deciding on what to go with."
490246,Garry2Rs,2010-08-01 12:25:00,1425,"The difference is the resolution. The 570 has 650 vertical pixels and a 16 level grayscale. The 560 has 12 level grayscale and 320 vertical pixels. Both would be good, but the 570 would be better."
490736,kyle7273,2010-08-03 02:24:00,65,"Well I up-sold myself and went with the 570. Got it on the boat this afternoon and took it out on Huron for a test. Seems to work good, marked lots of fish and has great bottom detail. I'll have to give it a few trips in different waters to know for sure if it suits me but first impressions look good."
490802,livinisfishin,2010-08-03 13:32:00,661,How do you like it compared to your old one?
491001,Roe Bag,2010-08-03 21:34:00,246,The 570 is by far your best choice. The last time I was at BPS they were on sale for $229. I have a 570 and a 580. The 580 is a discontinued fishfiner/GPS combo unit. It's basically a 570 until you activate the GPS. It accepts Navionics and was on sale at Radio World for $248 (1/2 price)Not sure but I think they cleared them all out. Recently we were fishing 90' of water on Simcoe for whitefish and we could clearly see our baits as we jigged them off bottom.
