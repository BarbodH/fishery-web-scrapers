490960,supernaut,2010-08-03 20:27:00,46,Hey! all you river fishermen Which Wading Jacket would you recommend for the upcoming fall S&S season? Thanks.
490973,Steel28,2010-08-03 20:54:00,160, I've been using Simms G3 Gore-Tex Guide jacket and absolutely love it. Very durable and comfortable. A+++
490980,MJL,2010-08-03 21:02:00,2427,I've been wearing my Simms Classic Guide jacket (which essentially is the current 'Guide' model) since 2004.  Absolutely Love it.  I wear it 4 seasons of the year as a rain/wind jacket as well as a general wading jacket to stuff tackle in.  The baggier cut allows for extra insulating layers underneath (eg. fleece jacket + hoody).  Only recently one of the seams in the hood started to leak (which I patched up with aquaseal).
