491000,TennesseeGuy,2010-08-03 21:34:00,957,"Be proud of this guy.  He's a super person and is scorching the National League with his bat:  Leading in home runs with 27 Leading in on base % at .420 5th in hits with 119 1st in total bases with 222 5th in RBI with 72 1st in slugging % @ .600 3d in runs scored with 74 5th in bases on balls with 60  ..............and he's an above average first baseman - also one of the best base runners on the team.  MVP???  At least a candidate if his team continues to win.  I've seen him play a bunch of games at AA Chattanooga, two spring trainings at Sarasota, FL and several games in Cincinnati since he went up to the big club.  There's not a nicer guy or harder worker in professional sports."
491031,g_clot,2010-08-03 22:47:00,104,"I second that.  I was at his first home Jays game 2 yrs ago and ended up sitting with and chatting with his dad.  Recently found out he passed away.  Such a class act.  Votto fought through it last year and has a lot to prove this year.  If not MVP in 2010, he'll be in the running for the next decade.  I love what the Reds have done these last few years."
491038,NAC,2010-08-03 23:03:00,369,"He's good but there's a pile of good canuck players in the majors these days. Justin Morneau,Jason Bay,Erik Bedard,Ryan Dempster,Rich Harden etc...  Votto is most exceptional though, can't believe they didn't think he was all-star worthy."
491059,Dave Bailey,2010-08-04 00:12:00,1641,"Votto is a great player, and he sounds like a class guy. I would love to see a Jays owner with bags of money and lots of guts try to sign a bunch of Canadian players, we should have at least one or two at all times."
491176,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-04 03:45:00,932,"Yeah, Votto is the guy turning the most heads in the NL this year - he's doing what Morneau did in his MVP campaign.  As a proud Canadian I hope the young guy gets it.  I've caught a few reds games on TV this year and the guy is something else."
491212,tdotfisherman,2010-08-04 11:36:00,317,"Votto wants to come to the Blue Jays, but I'm not sure the Jays have deep enough pockets for what its going to take to sign him."
491214,Whopper,2010-08-04 11:44:00,2174,TG I was lucky enough to watch him play for the local A team the Dayton Dragons along with a few others on the team. He keeps getting better
491339,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-04 19:24:00,932, The Jays aren't interested in spending money in the Post-Ted-Rogers-Era - that ship has sailed and it didn't even land the Jays a playoff spot.  Thankfully for me I'm a Bosox guy
