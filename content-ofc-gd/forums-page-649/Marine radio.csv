490908,walleyejack,2010-08-03 18:04:00,358,"I am looking to purchase a marine radio, not sure if it is worth it,but might be if i get caught on Lake O, any ideas on a good quality radio? done a little research, come up with a couple of Uniden possibilities. Any input would be appreciated, thanks al"
490919,Grimace,2010-08-03 18:25:00,2020,I bought a standard horizon from radio world.  Does the trick.  3 foot antenna plus radio was under 150 for the works.
490925,Fisherman,2010-08-03 18:36:00,7201,"Unidens are good, one fellow on one of the other boards has one for sale brand new for $100 although I see the same one, Uniden Solara, for $109 at Durham Radio in Whitby.  For an antenna, don't pi$$ around with the 3' noodles, get an 8', you'll be glad you did when you need it."
490929,walleyejack,2010-08-03 18:52:00,358,"Yes, I saw that on the other board,not worth it to drive to Jacksons point for $100 when i can go 5 blocks down the street to Durham radio for $9. more. thanks "
490930,walleyejack,2010-08-03 18:53:00,358,Grimace what model Standard Horizon did u get ? does it have some features on it ?  
490932,John,2010-08-03 18:56:00,2956,"I wouldn't go out on Lake O without one. I have a Raymarine unit, bought it on sale for around $150.00. I have a 3' stainless antenna with a coil at the base and unless you are planning to transmit from one side of the lake to the other it works well. I didn't have the available space to fold an 8' fibreglass antenna flat when not in use. I understand that the 4' shakespeare's work well too, although a little pricey."
491074,DRIFTER_016,2010-08-04 00:40:00,10439,"I put one of these in my boat last year and it is a really nice radio. It is one of if not the smallest fixed marine vhfs on the market. Plus it has all the features of larger radios. Cost is also reasonable. I run it with a base loaded 3' stainless antenna and get decent range, though not as good as an 8 footer. But 8' antennas look dumb on bass boats.    Here's a shot of it flush mounted in the helm of my boat.  "
491090,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-04 01:16:00,947,I've got the uniden Atlantis 250 Bk handheld unit love it battery life is amazing.  And i get the weather report from my house
491092,walleyejack,2010-08-04 01:21:00,358,"looks good drifter, i will be checking it out at Radio World Thanks for the input "
491096,Grimace,2010-08-04 01:28:00,2020,This is the one I have man.  I paid 115.  It looks like they have it on for 95.
