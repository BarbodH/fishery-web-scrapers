490789,tonyb,2010-08-03 12:40:00,1637,"It was great to finally get you guys out! it was my pleasure and I had just as much fun watching those fish battle against you and Rick.  We lucked out on some great conditions and the fish were certainly co-operative.  Too bad about the BIG one got away on us early in the morning!  For those who don't know, this trip was a prize that Rick won in a draw for voting for my cousins idea in the Aviva Community Fund program last year.  Although my cousin didn't win, he appreciated the support from Rick and everyone else that voted.  I look forward to seeing the pictures and video  Tony"
