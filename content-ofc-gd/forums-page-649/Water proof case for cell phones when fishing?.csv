490972,splashhopper,2010-08-03 20:53:00,2931,This past Sunday i flipped the canoe and lost my Blackberry to the river mud.  I just got it replaced this afternoon and want to be prepared for next weekend.  What waterproof cases do u all use?  Thanks
490977,alexcba,2010-08-03 20:58:00,634,i use the best and cheapest case ever made..

490983,ctranter,2010-08-03 21:05:00,543,"I use a backpack, and I dont flip my canoe =D  haha, jokes aside Mountain Equip Co Op has some great waterproof cases, not sure about the price.  Check BPS too"
490985,NAW,2010-08-03 21:07:00,4022,"I use a Seahorse water proof case.  Not sure the price of it, as I got it free through work.  It's big enough to hold a SLR, wallet, cell phone, and a few other small things.  If your looking for a small waterproof case, Pelican has a variety of sizes.  http://www.pelicancases.ca/  To Bad about the crackberry.  Hope you have a replacement plan of some sort!"
490989,batoathome,2010-08-03 21:18:00,47,just get yourself a good quality ziplock bag and attach a piece of foam bouyant enough to support it.  cost effective

491004,MJL,2010-08-03 21:40:00,2427,"Funny enough, I’ve dropped my cell phone into the river a total of 6 times and the aquarium once.  Dried it off each time and it’s still going.  Not bad for a cheap LG phone I got for free.  When in doubt, I use zip-lock  As for cameras, I’m averaging 1 per year."
491018,DRIFTER_016,2010-08-03 22:05:00,10439,"Just get one of the available waterproof phones out there. Motorola, Sanyo and Casio all make waterproof models.  Or do what I do and leave it on dry land. I'm always dropping things in the river or tripping and going for a swim."
491026,crappieperchhunter,2010-08-03 22:19:00,2582,"A Rubbermaid plastic sandwich container. Portable, cheap and takes alot more abuse then a ziplock bag. I don't have a cell phone but my I POD and earbuds have been safe and sound for years."
491036,Bly,2010-08-03 22:53:00,1556,"Ditto Ben's recommendation, have the same and have been happy with it."
491043,gaspumper,2010-08-03 23:41:00,393,Jeeeez is it that bad that you cant go fishing without having to have a phone with you?????
491050,Dave Bailey,2010-08-03 23:53:00,1641,I'll speak up for those who wish the dang thing would go to the bottom and stay there. But then I rarely take mine out in the canoe.
491052,Bly,2010-08-03 23:55:00,1556,"  it is when you are fishing solo and the kids are ""home alone"", other than that, hate when the thing rings even if I am not fishing."

491098,splashhopper,2010-08-04 01:33:00,2931, I bring it to take pictures with. You won;t catch me taking a call unless it is one of my children or my wife. They KNOW not to call unless it's some kind of emergency or sudden change of plans that I should be aware of.
491101,ch312,2010-08-04 01:38:00,1590,"my blackberry had a little bath from all the water we took in the boat yesterday on erie. it's been dried out 3 times so far, but i think its toast this time."
491107,splashhopper,2010-08-04 01:52:00,2931, I got a replacement one for 149 bucks (BB-8530) by extending my contract.
