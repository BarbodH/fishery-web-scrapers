490626,streamerstripper,2010-08-02 21:14:00,28, check out the william joseph stuff.  Can be a bit pricier but great quality and features...
490629,BillM,2010-08-02 21:32:00,17367,If you get a vest do not load it down with crap!!!!  I have mine loaded down with so much crap that my shoulders/neck are toast by the end of the day..  I carry a simple sidebag now and it's a huge relief on the shoulders...
490639,vinnimon,2010-08-02 21:53:00,2593,"As billm said! A vest can be a killer on the shoulders! I picked up a pack from uncle buck,a white river pack.2 front pouchs and a rear pouch thats removable.Lots of compartments and alot easier on the neck and shoulders! I think bps sells it!Not sure!"
490660,Mike Pike,2010-08-02 23:08:00,1332,Seems we're all in agreement.  A vest is an incorragement to stuff it full of stuff you won't use in all those pockets and then your neck and back gets sore after an hour of fishing.  I actully put my vest down by the river bank any chance I get and fish without it on.  I too am looking for opinions on packs.
490676,bassjnkie,2010-08-02 23:37:00,1101,"Thanks, I'll go with the check pack. Other than William Joseph and White River, is there another brand to look at."
490680,torco,2010-08-02 23:49:00,656,I still use a vest. Although you have to be careful to not overlaod yourself. I have gotten better with not filling every nook with stuff and my shoulders have thanked me. Never fished with a chest pack but I have seen some guys on the river and they seem to be ready burst they have it so full.  So I guess its really a matter of making sure what ever you carry feels comfortable.
490725,justin elia,2010-08-03 01:51:00,151," Check out Fishpond.  I use their vest and it has a lot of compartments.  If you river fish religiously (especially for steelhead), then you should be prepared for all conditions.  I pack as many items as I can comfortably fit in the vest.  You should be looking for something with a lot of compartments and one that is well made.  William Joseph and Simms are both good companies as well."
