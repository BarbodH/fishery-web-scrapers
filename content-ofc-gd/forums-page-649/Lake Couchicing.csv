491055,mike hagan,2010-08-03 23:58:00,50,Well went out to couch last week and found the fishing to be a little tough. Bigger lake that I remembered. and the waters were rough. Found it hard to stay on locations with the wind blowing so went searching for calmer waters . Didn't matter what side I was on because even the calmer side was still swerling the boat around. But managed to land a few nice ones plus one tagged fished from the MNR. Located most just on the inside  of the pencil reeds going out to deeper water. and the biggest one on a pile of cribs that produced a couple. Tried deeper water for the smallies but didnt have much luck .Just a couple of small ones.

That lake really rocks up in a hurry and this is a common theme with the Couch - it looks like you folks managed to still have a productive time out - some really nice bass there.  We got the elusive 8lb Walleye on the Couch earlier this year - they're out there!
