491155,anders,2010-08-04 03:01:00,1168,Does anyone use these and if so...how do they like it?  I just ordered one tonight and already cannot wait to get it here.  Are they easy to use and set up?
491161,Grimace,2010-08-04 03:08:00,2020,I envy you.  I want one pretty bad.  Enjoy man.
491220,tonyb,2010-08-04 12:06:00,1637,"Anders, I've had one since they came out.  You WILL catch more fish by using it, gauranteed.  A tip...contact Fish Hawk and order the metal transducer bracket.  I broke 2 of the plastic ones in the first year I used it, have been fine ever since going with the metal bracket.  The Fish Hawk X4 is great because you don't have to use coated cables and in the event you had a downrigger break, you just clip the probe onto the other downrigger and your back up and running.  Enjoy your new purchase, and get ready to start catching more fish!"

491267,bigfish1965,2010-08-04 15:08:00,3382,I got to see it in action on TonyB's boat ...it was amazing. You don't really understand what is going on down there with currents and stuff till you see that. The trolling speed at the cannonball is so much different than the surface speed and being able to adjust for the currents means more fish!
