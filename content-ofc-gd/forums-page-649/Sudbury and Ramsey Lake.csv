474110,SylvanOwner,2010-06-09 18:20:00,266,"Just a little report from last weeks trip too Sudbury.  I had the opportunity for a trip too Sudbury for a couple days for work and was hoping to tag on a few more days Crown Land camping, well the work part was good but life happens and the Crown Land routine will have to wait.  Anyway, I had asked OFC for some advice before I left and fortunately had received some from a few people but I have to make special mention of the advice from Mike P. - I could've done this blindfolded with the detail he provided.......http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=44004.  So, last Wednesday myself and 4 others from the conference set out to Moonlight Beach.  There was another group already at the far end of the rocks so we set up about halfway along the rocks.  Here's a photo of the scene for context and a little trip down memory lane for Mike P.  Bit of a hack-job on the image but hopefully gets the point across.    Action was a little slow but we were getting lots of little taps close in to shore.  A few bass were hooked and some landed and lots of rises on the surface so I switched from the suggested jig to a small floating Rapala and Bingo.....scored this eye when he ripped it off the surface....    That was it for bites except for the mosquitoes that soon drove us back to the car and then the comfort of the hotel room and beer just in time for the overtime period of the hockey game.  We did a few geocaches over the 2 days including one at the big nickel, saw a couple moose, several deer and a wild turkey on the drive back to Toronto.  Some more scenery shots taken from around the nickel.      Hope you enjoyed.   Dan"
