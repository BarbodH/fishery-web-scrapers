491093,chessy,2010-08-04 01:21:00,610,It has come to my attention that the MNR head office has screwed up the moose tag draw . they misplaced or lost or not imputed some or all of the last 4 days of group allocated moose draw participants. Some of you may have been entered some may not have been . IF YOU CALL AND IT SAYS YOUR OUTDOORS CARD NUMBER WAS NOT ENTERD INTO THE MOOSE DRAW  CALL HEAD OFFICE . I was there this morning wondering why our 2 groups were not entered in the draw and they played it low key but since then more information has come to light as of 20 min ago there are 9  groups that did not get put in and as you most of you may know alot of people have not called in yet to see
