491249,johnnyb,2010-08-04 14:14:00,3413,"Looks like a nice weekend....gotta love the walleye on the fly!  And no, that does not look like a happy snappa"

491328,Rich Clemens,2010-08-04 19:01:00,3131,Very Nice.   Where abouts in Perth were you fishing ?    I've stayed at Maple Crest Motel and Cabins in Rideau Ferry quite a few times - and this may be about 7 miles from Perth along route 1 (I believe).   Lots of great bass fishing in the Rideau.
