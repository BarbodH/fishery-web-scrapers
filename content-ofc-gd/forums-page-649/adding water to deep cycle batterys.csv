490686,archer379,2010-08-02 23:58:00,277,just wondering how often you should have to ad water to your deep cycle batterys and how bad is it to run them down
490690,vance,2010-08-03 00:06:00,719,I check mine once a week or more depending on how much I use them.Its really bad to let the water get to low.Make sure to used distilled water.I have a gallon that I bought and use it just for that purpose only.   vance
490712,Dutch,2010-08-03 01:06:00,831,Use a turkey baster or one of those sauce bottles chefs use to add the water to the battery.  No drip and fairly accurate fill.  You can stop the flow whenever you want.  Can get either at the dollar store.
490714,Fisherman,2010-08-03 01:07:00,7201,"If you check some of the RV sites, you'll quickly learn that most hard core battery users don't go below 50% capacity, it really sucks the juice out of them, better to have a pair or more and tax them less. Always recharge as soon as possible and get yourself one of those CTEK chargers, you can leave them hooked up all winter with no overcharging.  Distilled water only, just to the bottom of the slot in the filler holes."
