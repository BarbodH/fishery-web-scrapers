Did not take alot of pics but here are a couple.      asked these old goats if we could fish their dock, they told us to baaaaaaack off. "

These waters you fished look calm enough for a canoe; is this right out of downtown Trenton/Centennial Park area? Would love to give it a go in my canoe if it's not too far from shore.  Thanks for sharing, -fishindude"
