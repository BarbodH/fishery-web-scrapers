481238,walleyejack,2010-06-30 18:38:00,358,"I am thinking of putting a kicker on my 16 lund, got a deal on a 15hp merc, might be too much but will see i guess, my question is, is it better to mount directly on transom or install a kicker plate ? It is a long shaft. Any comments or ideas would be appreciated. Thanks"
481243,Terry,2010-06-30 18:51:00,14456,you don't need a bracket if it's a long shaft
481260,misfish,2010-06-30 19:43:00,29133,"  True,but how much room do you have to mount the motor on your transom? There cant be that much on a 16fter."
