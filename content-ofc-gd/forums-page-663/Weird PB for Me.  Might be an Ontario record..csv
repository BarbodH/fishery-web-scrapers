480683,alexcba,2010-06-29 05:11:00,634,shoulda gone with the classic hogan leg drop off the top ropes.
480685,Cudz,2010-06-29 05:15:00,2652,I asked the crowd what they wanted and pile driver it was.  Maybe next time.
480686,alexcba,2010-06-29 05:22:00,634,always the crowd pleaser
480736,Brettiop,2010-06-29 13:04:00,279,"There are so many sucker species to keep track of, but that is a hog for sure! Here is one of mine from earlier this spring caught while Steelheading, was a blast to get on the Centerpin! Weighed in at 9 lbs! I think this one is a type of Redhorse or sumthing...my PB from the sucker family was nearly 12lbs caught when i was about 12 lol! "
480767,NAW,2010-06-29 14:24:00,4022,"Nice catch Cudz.  For a minute there, I thought you where trying to disguise your self so your students didn't recognize you this summer.."
480850,Terry,2010-06-29 17:43:00,14456,that is one big sucker
480926,newboykool,2010-06-29 20:38:00,81,could  that be on of those product that u get when carp and sucker are mixed..?
480959,bassman87,2010-06-29 22:16:00,586,what did cudz ever do to you?
480960,alexcba,2010-06-29 22:19:00,634,nope its a golden redhorse sucker newboy
481019,jaydub,2010-06-30 00:33:00,145,"Congrates on the ""unofficial"" record sucker...I mean sucker record. That sweet stash takes the cake Cudz!"
481078,Cudz,2010-06-30 03:15:00,2652,"It is probably a redhorse.  If that is the case, it is not close to the record.  Either way, it is the biggest sucker I have ever caught."
481090,alexcba,2010-06-30 04:33:00,634,replace that smallie pic in your avatar with the sucker.. see how many people notice LOL!
480578,Cudz,2010-06-29 00:49:00,2652,"I was out fishing for crappie when I hooked into this brute.  I don't know much about these but I know it is a sucker and I have to assume it is a white sucker.  It put up a real strong fight.  At first I thought it was a carp but when i brought it in I realized it was not.  Anyway, I measured it and it was 23"" long and it weighed 5.64 pounds.  The current record for white sucker is 5.39 pounds.  That is totally irrelevant because a) I didn't kill it so it was not weighed on an official scale and  I don't really care to be an owner of a sucker record. lol. On a side note the fish crapped all over my newly made bow deck that I had not covered yet. It was almost the size of a goose crap.  I had to clean it up with a rag and iIpuked in my mouth a little bit.  Maybe you guys can correct me if I am wrong but I think it is a white sucker.  I can tell you one thing, they are stonger fighters than I thought they were.  length  feces on deck  weight "
480579,Sandbag,2010-06-29 00:52:00,533,"Its now officially the ""Poop"" deck.  Nice catch  You will now always be the unofficial Ontario Sucker Record holder in my books bud   Cheers  Craig"
