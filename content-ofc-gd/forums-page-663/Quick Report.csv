480663,TDunn,2010-06-29 03:49:00,680,"Well, we decided to get back out on the river this evening in search of some atlantics. On the water by 6:30 and on the first pass the rigger right in front of me doubles over. I set the hook and hand it off to Mike at the front of the boat. 10 minutes later he lands this beauty.      We reset the lines but can't seem to hook up for the next half hour or so. We decide to go try a few different spots on the american side with soft jerkbaits rather than trolling. First drift we witness a fierce feeding frenzy and reposition just above for a cast. All three of us cast and I am lucky enough to hook up with another good fish.      A drift or two later, I get a follow and then quickly pitch the plastic out again and hook up with another chromer.    The next several drifts results in no fish but we do get a few follows and hits keeping us on our toes. Soon enough, Ted hooks up with what is the biggest fish of the evening coming in at just under 31 inches.        We had planned on staying for walleye but we had to pull the pin due to being low on fuel. Ah well, back at it in a day or two!  All fish released. I hope you enjoyed!  TDunn"

480961,NAC,2010-06-29 22:27:00,369,"very nice fishing up your way right now, congrats! That male sure looks like a Brown except the dots are mostly on the dorsal side of the lateral line.  how long do they stay near the river now? They don't run until September, no?"
480986,TDunn,2010-06-29 23:25:00,680, The best bite lasts until the chinooks show up in august but they are present in the river year round. You can catch them right until the boat goes away.....  TDunn
