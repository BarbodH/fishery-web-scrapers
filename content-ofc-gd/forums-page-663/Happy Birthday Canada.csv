481657,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-02 13:17:00,932,"Couldn't help but thinking about what is most Canadian to me yesterday . . . and at the same time I was looking forward to my weeklong getaway starting tomorrow:  A trip to an island in the middle of Georgian Bay to a cottage with my lady, half-a-dozen close friends, beers, fishing, nature, and BBQing.  Then it hit me.  That's one of the most Canadian things any of us can do, and that's just a small part of what Canada means to me.  Best Country in the World.  Our small squabbles are nothing compared to the hardships other nations face.  A beautiful day yesterday with my GF and my Nephew, Bass-ing and taking in fireworks.  It was a great B-Day for Canada!  Cheers"
