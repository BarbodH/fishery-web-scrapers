481379,camillj,2010-07-01 03:16:00,1988,What .. no Lakers or Musky ?  Gr8 report !
481383,Cudz,2010-07-01 03:31:00,2652,"There aren't any in that lake.  It is a Muskoka lake, not Lake Muskoka"
480681,Cudz,2010-06-29 05:01:00,2652,"For the past 3 years I have been at a boys' weekend on a lake in Muskoka for opening day bass.  This year was a blast as always.  We all went to high school together and despite being 36-38 years old and living in different areas of Ontario, we still manage to get together.  There is a Gm of a major retailer, a general contractor, a honda factory worker, an insurance adjuster, a lawyer, a hydro one lineman, a golf pro and of course a school teacher (sounds like we should be singing a version of YMCA or something like that) As you can see from the pics there is a sweet moustache theme.  During the weekend there is a fins and skins tournament.  We try to catch 5 different species in the lake (walleye, lm bass, sm bass, pike, and crappie).  We have 2 teams of 4.  You get 1 point per species and a bonus point for each species if it is the biggest.  My team managed to catch all 5 species and at the same time managed to catch the largest of each species as well.  We therefore scored 10 points.  The other team manged only 4 species and none were bigger than ours so they only scored 4 points so that means we had a 6 stroke lead going into the golf.  Now on to the golf.  We play a shamble and score 2 of the best 4 per hole.  Once the 18 holes are finished we add up the team scores.  When all was said and done, we lost the golf by 7 strokes and therefore lost the competition by 1 Point!  Great weekend and fishing was good.  I forgot to sleep and am still recovering. We even managed to go on our midnight cruise without jumping the boat. I caught lmb, smb, rock bass, brown bullhead, walleye, crappie, pumpkinseed, pike, perch and a big sucker (5.6 pounds)  Leaving my house with some sweet cookie dusters on our lips   Early evening smallie   Night cruise without any drama   Little snot rocket   My buddy's LMB note deerfly biting his head. haha   Big sucker that dropped a huge deuce on my boat.   Tiny pumpkinseed.  Caught loads.  I don't really mind catching them.  They fight hard for little fish and really pretty.   Hungry friend with pike   Another friend with a nice little LMB   Nice little pike   Group shot of some bad staches   Nice nightitme smallie   Frog caught during golf   Some nice golf swag   Nice Little LMB   Bullhead lol   Nice evening walleye   My buddy trying to make a 4"" rockbass look bigger   Nice crappie "
480690,alphaalpha,2010-06-29 09:18:00,475,"Awesome 'staches!  sounds like you need to brush up on your golf for next year though  It's great to have annual trips like that, keep it up!"
480692,MCTFisher9120,2010-06-29 10:13:00,3761,"Nice job man, caught lot's of different fish with some competition thrown in  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"

480716,kickingfrog,2010-06-29 12:26:00,8333,Did Tony even try to grow a stash??? That was week.
480718,johnnyb,2010-06-29 12:27:00,3413,Sounds like a fantastic weekend....I am stunned at how many species you pulled out of Muskoka....I don't think I've ever even heard of anyone pulling out Crappie.  And that sucker is so beefy it looks like a carp!  Also...the t-bars are crazy blonde...what gives?!?!?  LOL
480743,blaque,2010-06-29 13:20:00,2419, That was a great multispecies/multisport report cudz

481026,jaydub,2010-06-30 01:00:00,145,Awesome weekend by the looks of it!  Too bad you guys couldn't pull out the win with a 6 point lead though   .  What's in it for the winners?  Probably not enough to give up fishing time to brush up on the golf game I'm guessing. lol
481036,LegitFish,2010-06-30 01:32:00,69,Thats a cool variety. Nice crappie! Did you catch all these with just a couple baits?
481058,Joey,2010-06-30 02:18:00,9122,"Mmmmmmmmmm frogs legs  Great report and pics, looks like you guys had a really good time.  You can tell you're all good buds.  Nice golfing outfits too  Joey"
481066,a.cortellessa,2010-06-30 02:29:00,142,Looks like you've caught about every species the lake has to offer! haha. good job
481076,Cudz,2010-06-30 03:13:00,2652,"Popped collar was def a part of the outfit. I just cotinued wearing it when I got back to the cottage and fished with it popped.  If you are going to go, go all out.  I am not sure if we got every species.  I think there may be some bowfin in there."
481077,GBW,2010-06-30 03:14:00,8460,"Shhh, better then Las Vegas...  Nice report Cudz, I look forward to the next time I can get out with my buddies like that."
481082,The Urban Fisherman,2010-06-30 03:22:00,2050,"Cudz ... Never really saw you as the kind of guy that refers to a punkinseed as really pretty... but hey you could easily pumble me so pretty they are! Haha great report-love the stash and it's nice to see that you get out with your homies once a year!  Cheers, Ryan"
481091,Dusky,2010-06-30 04:33:00,310,Perfect guys getaway! Nice report.
481109,Cudz,2010-06-30 11:45:00,2652,Oh yes he did.  Look closely.  It is very weak though.  Dirty little caterpillar on his lip.  Robby G did not grow one.  Said he couldn't because of his job (we think because of his wife) 
481217,daryl0815,2010-06-30 17:34:00,225,"Thats awesome, and sounds like a great weekend, I have been thinking about doing a fins and skins tournament myself, with a few buddies, targetting different species is an interesting way to do it!"
