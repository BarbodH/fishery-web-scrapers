I have a humbird hand unit.I only use it for listening to up to date forecasts on big water,as well as obstruction reports.I do listen in on ch 68 from time to time. My main purpose for it to call out in case of an emergency.Its rarely on!I used it once to call the coast gaurd,the never asked for a license! Do I need a license for it.I dont broadcast at all! If I decide to broadcast,without a license! Can I be fined! Where do I go or call for a coarse and test? Does anyone have a link to the 68 site,apparently its out of long point.I would like to check it out! Thanks in advance for any info"
