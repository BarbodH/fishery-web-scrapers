480239,a.cortellessa,2010-06-28 02:36:00,142,"Hi, welcome to Canada/Toronto!! If you have waders you can try the humber river at Old Mill, down at mimico creek which is on lakeshore and marie curtis park which is at long branch i believe. Goodluck! Welcome agian"
480243,alexcba,2010-06-28 02:39:00,634,centenial park has some monsters too. where in europe did you come from?
480263,nicolas82,2010-06-28 03:35:00,4,what about port perry and lake simcoe? are they good? I am from italy! I move not long time ago!
480265,nicolas82,2010-06-28 03:42:00,4, Is fishing  license ok or i need to pay extra?
480352,alexcba,2010-06-28 14:51:00,634,all you need is a license
480368,Jen,2010-06-28 15:49:00,833,"You can also try the shore of the lower Grand River.  Read some of ""fishmasters"" posts.  You can camp overnight and fish ... a great carp population.  776 Main Street East Dunnville, Ontario"
480386,sauce,2010-06-28 16:48:00,219,"If you are after carp, they're everywhere. No need to go far. All rivers that flow into lake ontario will have carp. You can fish lake ontario for carp too. Just get out and explore. You WILL find them."
480474,SBCregal,2010-06-28 20:46:00,688,i'd imagine you could get carp at the islands.  if the carp bite is slow theres pike and bass there too.  and about as local as it gets to downtown TO.
480480,vinnimon,2010-06-28 21:01:00,2593,  Chio signore!Tutte le carp si abidano in dutti laggi e fume in ontario.Qeulle grande si sta in laggo E.io pecsa con verme eh qeulle cosi gello.Babalussi buro!Chio e bon venuto signori pescaloro! Vicenzo
480499,alexcba,2010-06-28 21:32:00,634,"and when the carp bites dead put on the piccolo pezo di fero and catch some bass, or a grande pezo di plastico and go for pike... lol sorry im not italian, im a croatian trying to speak italian.."
480543,vinnimon,2010-06-28 23:00:00,2593,"  Last time out in sicily,sorry not trying to bump the thread,we used to go to a local resevoir and catch carp with snails.The carp were small 2 to 3 lbs at best.My grandmother would sun dry,salt and freeze a few for a meal the next week.They were great,not as good as what my cousins would bring in from fishing,but close. When I get the pics on the puter Ill post. Tuna,sea urchants,snails,octopus(yum)tuna still kicking(yum).Gotta find the pics of tuna swimming in the inlet at santo vito.Nicest beach ive seen in my life."

481258,throne7,2010-06-30 19:36:00,15," just so u know, carp in Canada taste like mud, unlike in the old world.  So just fish for fun, not for food.  For food go for bass, perch etc."
481262,alexcba,2010-06-30 19:55:00,634,"i disagree. my uncle fishes for carp out in Alliston and i often go over to his place for dinner. they taste pretty much just like they did back home and back home our favorite fresh water fish are carp and catfish. this is why carp have a bad name, people saying they taste bad or are a garbage fish."
