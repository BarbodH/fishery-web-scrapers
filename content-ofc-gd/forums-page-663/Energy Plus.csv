480138,Guidofisherman,2010-06-28 00:42:00,206,"It has been a few weeks since I caught this beautiful 24"" brookie. It weighed almost 7 lbs. and had the most beautiful spots I've seen in a long time. This one had a lot of extra energy when we took a few photos. The mouth shot clearly shows the boat-shaped structure of the vomer, a bone in the roof of the mouth, and the inner row of teeth that distinguishes members of the char family. Tagged and released. My boat has been in the shop waiting its turn to figure out the intermittent electrical problem. Now that the trim button is working, its time to head out for some more action...hopefully! Alan    "
