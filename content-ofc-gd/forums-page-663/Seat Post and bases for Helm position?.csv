From what I understand I need a base and post and seat base that have a ABYC code of AO for the helm but the passenger need only have a AN code? Are require by the Canadian authorities? Can someone suggest a good combo of seat posts , bases and seat mounts for helm, passenger and front casting deck seat, and where to get them in Ontario GTA area."

The downside to the power pedestal is that it doesn't make a great butt seat post due to lack of height in order to comply. They do have a 32-36"" pedestal for that rated as ""B"". One system covers it all. These products should be readily available at a marine dealer near you."
