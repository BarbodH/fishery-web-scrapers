481366,g_clot,2010-07-01 02:01:00,104,So I'm off to visit the mom&pops next weekend in Bob Izumi's home town Blenheim.  It's right by Rondeau Provincial Park and thought I'd check if any of you know a reasonable place to rent a boat or a productive shore location to kill a few hrs?

At times, the perch fishing can be awesome off the pier.  Morning and evenings have worked best for me.  Good luck   Cheers  Craig"
