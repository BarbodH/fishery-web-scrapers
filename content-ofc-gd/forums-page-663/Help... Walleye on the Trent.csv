I was rear ended in a car accident back in april while stoped at a red light, and screwed my back.  I have had to give up going fishing in a boat, due to the shock waves from the ride causing pain in my back.. But I am not giving up on fishing from shore, as also being on meds for the pain its about the only fishing I can do.  I have been fishing the locks at Glen Ross, Healey, & North end of Campbellford.. But not having much luck.. No walleye yet this year. Only thing I have caught worth mentioning is a small pike. But I would like to be able to get into a few nice walleye for dinner.  If someone is willing to share some info on where I could get into a few walleye from shore in Trenton, Brighton area or up the Severn to about Glenn Ross I would greatly appreciate it.. Any info shared will stay private with me. and could be emailed directly to [emailÂ protected]  Thank You  Chad "
