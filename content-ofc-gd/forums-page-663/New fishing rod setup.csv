Thank you very much spiel for the fishing rod and Gerritt for the stradic fishing reel  The funny thing is when T.G found out i got a stradic he tried to buy it for 20$    Sam  "
481220,JohnF,2010-06-30 17:46:00,3494,  Never trust hairy OFNers. Us old bald guys are fine though. I'll give you $30 for the reel.  JF
481221,youngfisher,2010-06-30 17:54:00,27,Ahaha make it 200 then we will talk alright    Sam
481222,Roy,2010-06-30 17:55:00,13728,"WOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOO! You're gunna be a happenin' dude down by the river now, Sam. The Stradic happens to be my favourite spinning reel. Don't know about the rod but if it came from Spiel, it's a good one. And John is right don't trust hairy OFNers....Old bald guys are not much better though....Old hairy dwarfs are ok though...I'll give you $50 for it.  I'm happy for you Sam."

481226,Gerritt,2010-06-30 18:01:00,6129,"Might want to lower you're price Sam, BPS has em for 159.99 right now lol  G"
481227,youngfisher,2010-06-30 18:02:00,27,ahaha ok gerritt but still i love my stradic thank you for it    Sam
481228,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-30 18:10:00,932,"The Stradic is my favourite spinning reel as well.  I've had mine (that I got for the discount price of $100 shipped - brand spanking new) for 3 years now and it's just like the day I bought it.  It has never seized up, and required no service (but I grease it now and then for good measure).  I've never fished the rod you got, but I'm sure it is great (though I love avids the most).  Cheers and congrats on a sweet setup!"
481229,youngfisher,2010-06-30 18:11:00,27,Thank you very much    Sam

481297,Spiel,2010-06-30 21:41:00,9065,Sounds like you're good to go Sam.  To clarify I didn't build the rod but I did win it and it had never been used before I gave it to Sam.
