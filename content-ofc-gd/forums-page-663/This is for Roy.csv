481530,nofish4me,2010-07-02 00:27:00,404,"Northwest Passage always runs a chill down my spine, makes me puff out my chest and swig rum (wife and kids just shake their head). Must be the marine heritage in my blood. Having said that, I'm a born and raised SW Ontario feller, so the ""Field Behind the Plow"" strikes a strong cord with me.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUM8mXJre1c  In the previous Ian Tyson/John Hiatt clip they mentioned Alex Carone. Here's a snipet from an article printed in March 2010: ""Alex Carone, a Nevada-raised cowboss on the Singleton Ranches has been able to stick close to his buckaroo roots and still respect the puncher way of doing things."". The song reflects an image of the past, but that's the way Alex runs his men and horses."
