481035,Fisherpete,2010-06-30 01:31:00,1814,"Tough weather made for a really tough day out there today. Started fishing around 2:30pm, and the lake went from glass calm with scorching sun to howling wind, driving rain and whitecaps within an hour. After the storm blew through, I hooked and lost one, and a few hours later got a decent 40"". I think the fishies saw an awful lot of lures on the bass opener... As a plus, Al's son marco got a keeper walleye on the same musky lure that I got one on last week... yum.    "

481052,skeeter,2010-06-30 02:05:00,1907,"fisherpete is good, but why does he always have to get the first 4 fish before he lets his guests get any?????"
481061,Fish Farmer,2010-06-30 02:20:00,2234,"Nice fish, is that an Erie fish? I caught one last week on Erie near Rock Pt. same size with stand out markings."
481083,fishindude,2010-06-30 03:25:00,220,"I don't think musky are the fish of 10,000 casts for Fisherpete, more like fish of every other cast it seems  Great job man!"
481105,Steve Piggott,2010-06-30 11:11:00,196,"Keep on casting,nice job"
481113,Fisherpete,2010-06-30 12:12:00,1814,"Lol... thanks guys! But I was in their boat, so I was the guest... that makes it OK for me to outfish them. Last trip with Al, after getting the first three or four skis, I took off my hot lure and gave it to him to use. The same last Thursday with my bro! I try to share lol... I am just a muskie whisperer hahaha!!! Have you heard of a rain dance? Well, before every outing, I do a muskie dance.  1) Stomp feet, left first, them right. Repeat 4 to 5 times. This must be done in the boat so that the fish can hear and feel the vibrations. 2) Chant ""Hiya hiya muskie dance"". Make your voice sound as deep as possible. 3) Repeat until you feel silly. This does not take long. 4) Works even better when you perform in front of guests.  It is a Kawarthas fish, there are many in this lake with these markings. I actually first started fishing this lake after seeing posts with muskies from there, and liking their markings. You are right though, looks a bit like a LSC or Erie ski."
481117,lew,2010-06-30 12:31:00,12766," Pete, my brother  was a great bass & pickeral fisherman but hardly ever fished for musky and had no gear for them.  I invited him out one morning and as we pulled into a little bay that I have a lotta luck in I gave him a rod and a favorite musky bait of mine. He clipped it on, went to the back deck and on the very 1st cast of the morning he got a musky. I hadn't even put the troll motor in the water yet.  He said, ""well, there's nuthin to catching these things, let's go try for something else""  Oh, nice musky for you too BTW Pete , sorry for the hijack"
481118,Harrison,2010-06-30 12:34:00,2202, goodun.  Nice fish bud!
481142,ehg,2010-06-30 13:45:00,2666,Another decent musky for you  Have to try that lake.
