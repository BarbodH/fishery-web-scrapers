I then proceeded to remove the prop and found that the line actually got quite deep in there. I have removed all the line but I know all the seals needs to be replaced.  Where should I go to buy these parts? I'm considering to replace the impeller as well while I'm at it. My motor is a 1986 Evinrude 20hp (E20TECDC).  Prior to this I have only changed the plugs/gear oil so I have no experience what so ever ... is there anything I should keep in mind/pay attention to? I plan to read up on some online tutorials and watch lots of youtube videos of this sort of repair to learn how to do it.  Thanks!  Victor"

481147,bigbuck,2010-06-30 13:53:00,2449,You probably should replace the impellor as well. You'll have the lower unit apart anyways. I don't think it would be that difficult especially since you change your own oil and do basic maintenance yourelf. For Evinrude parts in the T.O. area check out: Klaus Marine Service 17 Arnold Street Etobicoke  They are off the Gardiner down by Kipling I believe.
