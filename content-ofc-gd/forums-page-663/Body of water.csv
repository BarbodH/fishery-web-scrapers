I drove up to Collingwood yesterday and while driving on Highway 89 in the Hamlet of Damascus there was a small lake on the east side of the highway. I checked the GPS but it just said it was ""Small Lake"".  Anyone know the body of water and if there is anything in it?"
481279,alexcba,2010-06-30 20:37:00,634,"doesn't 89 run east and west? i think you might be talking about pike lake.  this maybe?   sorry bad link.. type in minto pines road, ontario into your browser. see if thats what comes up."
481288,Spiel,2010-06-30 20:58:00,9065,"  Yep, #89 runs East West. Perhaps you were on #24?  "
481289,solopaddler,2010-06-30 21:11:00,8605,"It's known locally as (surprise, surprise) Damascus Lake.  It's actually a small reservoir known to have decent bass fishing.  Not sure about public access though."
