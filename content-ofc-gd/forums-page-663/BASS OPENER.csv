481361,canadian_copper,2010-07-01 01:50:00,925,GOT OUT ON THE GOG AT 6AM WITH MY FRIEND TONY. CONS WERE PRIME BUT WAS A TOUGH DAY FISHIN. CAUGHT GOOD FISH BUT REALLY HAD TO WORK FOR THEM. AND THE RAIN  LOL FIRST 3 CASTS AND BOOM A BEAUTY 4LB SMALLIE. CANT COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT TO START THE SEASON OFF LOL  LOST A MONSTER IN THE RICE GRASS OVER 5LBS  (HAD A SMALL SWEARING SESSION  LOL) FIRST TIME EVER USING A BAITCAST ROD AND REEL WITH THE JIG AND MANAGED AN AVERAGE FISH.  PINK SENKO PRODUCED WELL FOR THE MOST OF THE DAY. STILL ON THE HUNT FOR THAT 6LBER. MAYBE THIS WEEKEND
