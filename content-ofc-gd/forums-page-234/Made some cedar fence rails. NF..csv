856158,Rod Caster,2014-06-01 13:25:00,5784,"I've been eyeing-out a couple large, fresh-fallen cedars on my property. Finally I decided to do something with them. Looked up how to split cedar rails and went at 'er. I've made a few technical errors but I'm getting good results. Got 10-14foot rails out of 3/4 of one section. I might put them up on kijiji... my thumb and back kind of hurt, so pay up if you want them  On the way in I saw these tracks:                     "
856160,kickingfrog,2014-06-01 14:01:00,8333,That flat footed bear needs to see a podiatrist.  Are those approved safety shoes?  Who needs a gym membership eh?
856161,NAW,2014-06-01 14:35:00,4022,That's with wicked chad!
856164,Rod Caster,2014-06-01 15:08:00,5784,I get so warm doing the work that I travel the ATV with the lightest clothing possible haha
856166,Twocoda,2014-06-01 15:55:00,4130,Split cedar rails serve a purpose for sure ...but if you have enough cedar you might want to consider purchasing a mobile mill
856176,Rod Caster,2014-06-01 17:42:00,5784,"I've got a fee big cedars, but not enough to harvest in any way. I'll be milling some spruce here soon."
856220,Big Cliff,2014-06-01 22:44:00,6899,Good for you! Most guys would have just cut it up for fire wood! Really glad to see you making the best use out of them!
856224,spincast,2014-06-01 22:51:00,3279,"my, that looks relaxing.   so, I guess cedar must keep the bugs away?  Or do you have a secret recipe for that? May come in handy in July? But seriously - good on ya man. Maybe you can make a play pen for the up and coming mini-rod-caster?"
856227,Joeytier,2014-06-01 23:21:00,3990,I hope you reported those samsquench tracks!!
856239,chris.brock,2014-06-02 00:16:00,4053,"really cool, I love old school stuff like"
856242,Rod Caster,2014-06-02 00:37:00,5784,Got 15 large rails from the base section. 3-4 hours of work and I'm still learning.The next section was knotted up badly and my two wedges are burried in the log.  I'll take another hour this week and try to do a bit more.      
856255,Joey,2014-06-02 01:28:00,9122,That's really cool!
856269,Nipfisher,2014-06-02 02:42:00,2449,Kick ass trailer for sure. Find the deer highway and we will set up a blind for the crossbow / rifle hunts.
856281,HTHM,2014-06-02 10:05:00,4082,"if you have 24 feet, if you mill them you could have material for a cedar strip canoe."
856292,Rod Caster,2014-06-02 12:15:00,5784,"Kick ass trailer for sure. Find the deer highway and we will set up a blind for the crossbow / rifle hunts. More like, find the intersection of the many deer highways! Still need to get you over for a visit and ATV ride.  if you have 24 feet, if you mill them you could have material for a cedar strip canoe. Your giving me way too much credit. I can swing axes and wedges and lift things up and put them down,  but an actual craftsman I am not. Plus I'm trying to make a bit to $ to help pay for a certain Nipigon trip..."
856352,misfish,2014-06-02 19:34:00,29133,Thats very cool dude.
856355,mistaredone,2014-06-02 19:47:00,913,Awesome!!
