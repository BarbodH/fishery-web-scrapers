A boat is only really needed for out in the middle of the bay, most areas are fishable from shore, but there are some great spots you can get to in a boat"
855974,JoshS,2014-05-30 16:17:00,729,"Yeah the only launches are either Humber to the west and Ashbridges to the east. Both are a good run to the islands. Watch the wind forecasts, you have a long open water drive from either launch. Depending on your boat, hit it on low winds or north wind. Goodluck."
855981,shimano19,2014-05-30 17:09:00,196,Ah okay so nothing near the islands to launch at. What about around boat docks and stuff at marinas. Is there anything there?
855988,msp,2014-05-30 18:02:00,1336,"The fishing in and around the T.O. harbour can be seasonally good at times. The people in the various marinas can be a pain in the you know what sometimes. As stated earlier the only launches are at Humber Bay west and Ashbridges bay. Both are good concrete launches but a bit of a run into the islands and Harbour.
