856305,T-Bone,2014-06-02 14:20:00,160,"Starting to plan and prep for the annual Lake Kipawa trip in July.  We usually bring up about 396 pounds of meat from Ohio on dry ice in a huge cooler. This year we're thinking about skipping that hassle and just getting our meats up in North Bay before we ""head in"" to Lake Kipawa for a week of fishing heaven on earth.  Any recommendation out there for a good butcher / meat shop in North Bay?  Thanks in advance for your insights...  "
856306,Rod Caster,2014-06-02 14:25:00,5784,"Bay meats (used to be Bavarian meats) on Wallace Rd. close to Highway 11/17 is pretty much the only option.(705) 476-1830  ()â€Ž  Or, if you are passing by Verner/Sturgeon Falls, go to creative meats."
856307,dracokaos,2014-06-02 14:30:00,116,"Hey T Bone,  I dont know North Bay but I have a cottage just North of Huntsville which is about 90mins south from North Bay. I always use Big Daddy's Fresh Meats. Meat is always awesome. Never had an issue. You can also call and place orders.  I highly reconmend them  Cheers"
856316,Steelheadphycho,2014-06-02 16:01:00,470,396 lbs?!?! Holy cow! (No pun intended) how many people are you taking? Or is that bear bait?
856326,T-Bone,2014-06-02 17:45:00,160,"Thanks for the info all...  And I was being facetious about the weight, though that's about how much the cooler feels like it weighs when we're moving it around."
856329,bare foot wader,2014-06-02 17:59:00,1354,"my buddy's dad and his friend brought a good 30 lbs of cheese combined on a fly in fishing trip...396 could be believable for a large group, probably back you up more than 30 lbs of cheese did lol"
856431,Nipfisher,2014-06-03 02:34:00,2449,We get all our fresh meat from Don's Butcher Shop in Sturgeon Falls.
856432,ctdd2006,2014-06-03 03:01:00,531,....assuming you're coming through the soo...Tarini's in Sudbury is fantastic and only an hour and a half west of North Bay.  Stuffed and seasoned Pork Chops are a must.
856433,Muskieman,2014-06-03 03:10:00,2472,"I second Don's Butcher shop , you may want to contact "" butcher "" a board member ... he's local , worked at ( Bavarian / Bay ) for 10yrs or so and is still connected in the trade ."
856437,solopaddler,2014-06-03 04:03:00,8605,"Oftentimes we'll grab our groceries enroute to our camp in QC at the Independent supermarket as you're heading through town on your right. They have these huge thick steaks that they call ""beefeaters"". Just unreal and very cheap."
856448,T-Bone,2014-06-03 13:10:00,160,"Thanks for the replies; we're coming from the south (TO, Muskoka) so only Huntsville and North Bay are good options.  Mike...is the 'independent' store in North Bay? If so, approximate location and/or name? Or are you talking about the one in Temiscaming?  Thanks again everyone...just what I needed."
856452,Joeytier,2014-06-03 13:26:00,3990,"Our grocery store here in Temiscaming has been closed down for approx a year and a half now and our new store wont be open this summer so don't count on that!  The independent in North bay is in Northgate mall right on the corner of 17 and 63, which would be very convinient for you"
856453,solopaddler,2014-06-03 14:00:00,8605,"Joey beat me to it. You drive right past it, couldn't be more convenient."
856454,T-Bone,2014-06-03 14:07:00,160,Yes Joey...I was aware the Provigo was closed about Christmastime in 2012. Exciting news on the new IGA up there though.  And thanks Mike...I'll scope it out when we enter town and go from there.  Thanks.
856455,Rod Caster,2014-06-03 14:30:00,5784,"INdependent is quite expensive ... Go to bay meats (better meat too), just as 'on your way' as the grocery store."
856456,Dara,2014-06-03 14:47:00,3052,What do you have against coming through the Sault
856460,T-Bone,2014-06-03 16:12:00,160,I've got nothing against the Sault...love that area. It's just that route adds a little over 170 miles to the trip and about 2.5-3 hours to the route time. And we have a certain cadence to going up via Buffalo / TO / Muskoka area. And now we know where to shop for meat...
856548,Canuck2fan,2014-06-04 01:03:00,1444,You aren't driving by any Costco's on the way? I would stop at one of them if you quality at a good price...
856728,Maverick,2014-06-05 01:54:00,371,"The Independent is a large grocery store on the corner of 11/17 and Trout Lake Rd. You can't miss it. It has a butcher shop in the store, you can ask for different cuts than what is out. I picked up a brisket there and the guy brought it out from the back and I was able to ask for exactly the portion I wanted. If you are looking for an actual butcher shop Don's in Sturgeon Falls, 30 mins west of North Bay, is very good as others have said."
856743,leaf4,2014-06-05 02:29:00,2466,in keeping with the same topic rather than starting a new thread... I'll be heading up to collingwood this weekend any butchers on the way up from hamilton that have reasonable prices?
