856589,big guy,2014-06-04 12:05:00,414,"I am very interested in reading about your trip and any other trips you have had to this lake. I've been up that way a few times (Wakami, the Domtar rd through to Webbwood etc) and have looked at that lake on the map on more than a few occasions and thought it would be an ideal place to go.  Please share about this years trip and any other trips you've been on up there, very interested in reading about access point(s), fishing quality, campsites and anything else in general.  Thanks very much"
