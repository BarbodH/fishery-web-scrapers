Hope you don't mind me posting this here Mark, but I've got a great working relationship with the owner of this lodge. If anyone might be interested in a trip to Chaudiere please drop me a line!!"

856638,Hank Jr,2014-06-04 18:28:00,146,Great report and nice pictures . We have been to the lodge and like the upper French . Looks like Dad enjoyed it as well .
856671,Joeytier,2014-06-04 20:56:00,3990,Awesome report and excellent fishing.  I'm sure most didn't have them dialed in like you guys given the tough conditions
856699,Jigster,2014-06-04 23:13:00,33,"Many thanks for the kind words everyone!  Joeytier - you're right about the conditions being tough. the most common mistake people make up there in is 1 -not to stick with the jig and minnow and 2- not to use a stinger hook. The other invaluable tool we had was a lowrance split screen gps/sonar, which was absolutely huge on those slow days. Sometimes I'd just put around contours until we found  a pod of fish, and with no wind, we'd just sit there and twitch the bait right off the bottom. I did mark a ton of suspended fish though and was thinking maybe a spoon would have been effective. Anyone have a productive no wind/sunny condition technique for eyes? As for being ""dialed in"", I'd say at the upper french that would mean 30+ fish days (especially when bass opens)... was there last year when a hailstorm hit and it was one after the other walleye on the main channel using gulp... awesome  "
856738,Maverick,2014-06-05 02:13:00,371,Looks like an awesome trip.
856741,can u fish,2014-06-05 02:23:00,326,Looks like a great trip and congrats to your dad on that 27 inch walleye great way to finish the trip.  Cheers Mitch.....

856772,Pigeontroller,2014-06-05 12:43:00,2793,"Great report! Chaudiere is a great Lodge and Steve is a gracious host, I highly recomend it to anyone looking for a nice getaway!  Which rapid was that?"
856778,Jigster,2014-06-05 13:20:00,33,"Pigeontroller - those rapids in the first two pics are at Recollet Falls, which is at the end of a great hike starting at the French River Visitor Centre. We stopped there on the way up to Chaudiere and I highly recommend both the hike and the exhibits. The hike takes about 30 min one way, follows the French River Gorge and is stunning. It's a great way to break up the trip and get some exercise. If I ever do that hike again I'm definitely packing some gear as the water around the falls looks amazing.  http://www.visitgeorgianbay.ca/scenic-vistas.cfm?action=1&things_to_doid=59&category=0"
856793,Pigeontroller,2014-06-05 16:10:00,2793,"One year I was on the Lower French, meant to make the run upstream to see those rapids...Once a paddler, always a paddler!"
