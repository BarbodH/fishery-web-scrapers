856351,workwear,2014-06-02 19:34:00,592,anyone know of a competent mechanic to service trailer bearing in the richmondhill newmarket area....  goin on a long trip soon need to get them serviced
856356,mistaredone,2014-06-02 19:51:00,913,"Its not a though DIY if your into that sort of thing and you could save yourself $150 or so for two hours of work.  As for recommendations, anywhere other than Canadian Tire"
856363,Bill Shearer,2014-06-02 20:24:00,456,"^ echo the above. A great skill to know, and easy to learn."
856365,Garry2Rs,2014-06-02 20:35:00,1425,"If you DIY, you might want to pick-up a spare set of bearings and even a spare hub. Fortunately, I never needed them, but always carried a complete spare set when on long trips. IE my 2000 mile haul to AZ in the Fall, before adding a second boat down there... These are cheap items and worth having on hand."
856366,Fisherman,2014-06-02 20:35:00,7201,Something that should be done every fall after the last trip to ensure there's no water in there to rust away all winter.  That way you're good to go in the spring.
856371,misfish,2014-06-02 20:52:00,29133,"Approve all above.  It,s something all trailer owners should know about and be able to do. Nothing worse then blowing a bearing on a trip. When we did the deer and moose hunts. We carried 2 full hub assemblies and tires and rims with us."
856381,bushart,2014-06-02 21:30:00,2628,If you change em out also and they're still in good shape---but just to be safe  you could keep the old stuff as spares---of course they're not that expensive if you buy a new set of spares  good idea though
856395,Fisherman,2014-06-02 23:08:00,7201,"And if you need new ones, go to a good place like Canada Bearing and then also ask for ""double lipped seals"".  They really prevent water intrusion."
856554,Sinker,2014-06-04 01:31:00,8692,"I also carry a spare hub/bearing assembly with my spare tire. Knock on wood....ive never had to use it, but its much easier to replace the whole hub/bearing assembly than it is to do a bearing job on the side of the hwy.  S."
856558,Whitespinnerbait,2014-06-04 02:10:00,2038,Here's what they bearing grease looks like in the Spring.......This is why they should be done every Fall !!!
