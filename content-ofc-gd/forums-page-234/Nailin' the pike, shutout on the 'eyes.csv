856032,Joeytier,2014-05-31 01:53:00,3990,Nice job.  I hope they had a hot date with a pound of lard...mmmmmm
856035,kickingfrog,2014-05-31 02:32:00,8333,Cast iron pan on the BBQ side burner and canola oil. Grilled asparagus on the side. No risotto this time though.
856039,Joeytier,2014-05-31 03:01:00,3990,Sign me up
856041,Rod Caster,2014-05-31 03:04:00,5784,Eaters!
856047,dhickey,2014-05-31 03:34:00,1038,Hammer handles.
856049,manitoubass2,2014-05-31 03:43:00,11391,Do you fillet them the 5 fillet method? I love eating those smaller firm pike. I prefer mine in a boil though
856074,kickingfrog,2014-05-31 14:49:00,8333,"My brother cleaned them while I was getting the kids.  I've only cleaned a handful of pike and the last one would have been over 20 years ago. Back when we we're younger the fish cleaning was done by the youngest. Jim was the last grandchild so he ended up with the most experience. Now it's self fulfilling: He's better then me, he cleans them. I don't clean them, I don't get better.  We've got our system down. I get the boat buttoned up, refill the gas, retie the rods, dry out the gear etc. and prep/cook the food... open the beer.  With my kids loving fish and fishing I'll have get some practice soon... at least until Ryan's uncle teaches him how to clean fish."

856235,BillM,2014-06-01 23:59:00,17367,"Yup, the 5 fillet method works great, especially on 15lbrs!"
856237,Joeytier,2014-06-02 00:06:00,3990,Yeah I really like the 7-10 pounders for table fare.  I'm going to try pickling some pike meat the next time I take a couple home.
