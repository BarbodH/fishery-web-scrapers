(May 27, 2014) – Cabela’s Canada will celebrate the official grand opening of its new Barrie, Ontario store at 11 a.m. Thursday, July 10. A ribbon-cutting ceremony hosted by Cabela’s executives and special guests will begin at 10:45 a.m.  Opening day will kick off a weekend-long celebration highlighted by special appearances, family events, giveaways and more.  The 70,000-square-foot store – Cabela’s first Ontario location – will be located near the intersection of Highway 400 and Mapleview Drive in the Park Place Shopping Centre. It is expected to employ approximately 200 full time and part time employees.  The building’s exterior will reflect Cabela’s popular store model with log construction, stonework, wood siding and metal roofing. A large glass storefront will allow customers to view much of the store’s interior as they approach the building.  The inside will feature the company’s next-generation layout designed to surround customers in an outdoor experience, including museum-quality wildlife displays and a large mountain replica. In addition to thousands of quality outdoor products, the store also will feature an indoor archery range and archery tech room, Bargain Cave and Fudge Shop."

I guess we do things differently.  I do all my research beforehand (especially if I'm buying a bigger ticket item)  All I'm looking for is the lowest price, my mind is made up well before I even step foot into the store.  Make sure you ask around here before venturing into a big box store and start dropping $100's on fishing gear"

Never had a problem with BPS or Cabelas's both were on the trip list and both had certain advantages, having one close by is one of the biggest advantages.

Unfortunately, they bump the prices up quickly citing foreign exchange whereas back when the dollar went par, it took a year and a bunch of consumer complaining to get pricing corrected. Kind of like gas prices...when the price of oil goes up, that somehow changes the price of the gas already delivered to a gas station a few days before."

826888,crappieperchhunter,2013-12-27 19:52:00,2582,Barrie is just far enough away that I will probably never make it in the store....but thx for the update anyway Brian. I'm sure many will appreciate it.
826889,misfish,2013-12-27 20:01:00,29133,"look for christmas 2014.  the builder does great work, just not often completed on time.  Funny you say that. The useless Target store started after this one did,and is farther ahead.  Quality takes time. I can wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I think.LOL   Steve,I no believe.LOL"
826894,RangerGuy,2013-12-27 21:06:00,564,Man I hope they do it right!  Good stock & reasonable prices... AND THE SERVICE LIKE IN THE STATES!!!!!!
826896,Steve,2013-12-27 21:10:00,2075,"well, they have to see if they can ""up"" sail.  bps is a joke among most, but sail is quite a good shop."
826900,misfish,2013-12-27 21:17:00,29133,"well, they have to see if they can ""up"" sail.  bps is a joke among most, but sail is quite a good shop.  I drive down from Barrie to Sail,cuz of their pricing. If I see that Cabelas is over pricing them.I,ll be sure to let them know..  BUT,on the other hand,maybe they will price match,and save me the travel."
826941,porkpie,2013-12-28 00:14:00,2521,"I live a fair distance away, but I love cabelas.  I will be making the trip every time I pass Barrie if its anything close to a US cabelas!"
826944,grt1,2013-12-28 00:40:00,638,the building could be slow because of all the timber and beam construction they have inside.
827074,Steve,2013-12-28 18:36:00,2075,"grt1, your correct.  not a ""standard"" building construction for sure.  the builder is known for this type of 'non standard' construction.  i'm sure it'll be purdy when complete."
827085,kickingfrog,2013-12-28 19:47:00,8333,Sure it's not the typical retail building but the design hasn't changed from when they first projected a late spring opening. This isn't the first  one Cabelas has built or even their first cold weather construction site. Maybe someone was too aggressive when they first announced the opening but there shouldn't be too many surprises.
827086,misfish,2013-12-28 19:59:00,29133,"What I found cool,was the outer structure is made of that  concrete filled foam.blocks."
827095,Marko,2013-12-28 20:58:00,854,"For some reason i dont think they are going to have American prices. If anything it will be very similar to one in Manitoba (price wise) Target didnt bring their prices from the south of the border, i doubt these guys will.I hope i am wrong though"
827098,leaf4,2013-12-28 21:14:00,2466,"very true, target is more expensive than walmart in most categories, I walked through once and haven't been in again"
827110,misfish,2013-12-28 22:04:00,29133,"very true, target is more expensive than walmart in most categories, I walked through once and haven't been in again  Targets a disgrace. I too did one walk in. No going back."
827116,Marko,2013-12-28 22:32:00,854,"As I walked through the stupid store one day with my gf i couldnt believe how expensive everything was. Zellers had much better prices, too bad they couldnt figure it out"
827529,GBW,2013-12-31 00:04:00,8460,I'm shocked that they didn't invite you in Brian for an OFC official photo shoot update!  I so need to place a call and or email to someone...  J/K! Its funny you posted this as my dad was asking me over the weekend when they are going to start building this location.  I said they broke ground last I knew.  So TKS B!
827567,BillM,2013-12-31 03:38:00,17367,"Their prices will be in line with BPS's, why would anyone think the prices would be in line with their American stores?"
827660,grimsbylander,2013-12-31 16:30:00,3016,"I'm waiting for the Cheektowaga, NY location. Closer and cheaper."
827661,misfish,2013-12-31 16:34:00,29133," Im going to ask,once they start the inside.  N/K"
827667,Raf,2013-12-31 17:02:00,3495,"the building could be slow because of all the timber and beam construction they have inside.  yes, all the locations i've been to in the states are fairly elaborate  i'll definately check them out in barrie.  if anyone has not been to one, it'll be worth your time and make bps look like walmart."
827908,Frank,2014-01-01 17:15:00,74,"I'm waiting for the Cheektowaga, NY location. Closer and cheaper.  Yeap, same here. as it stands, I buy quite a bit of stuff from Cabelas, but I have a USA mailing address, so I get great prices and cheap or sometimes free shipping to my USA mailbox. However, I am sure I will make use of the Barrie Cabela's too, I do a fair bit of fishing in the Almaguin Highlands area and Cabela's Barrie will be my new pitstop on the way through. I am pretty excited for the opening of both Cabela's in Cheetowaga, NY and Barrie, Ont. and the Bass Pro Shop opening in Niagara-On-The-Lake, Ontario."
827943,grimsbylander,2014-01-01 19:26:00,3016,"It will be a great convenience for anyone needing a last minute item or two or for those without easy access to the US. I will no doubt stop into the new BPS in Niagara for things not worth crossing the border for but no one should expect the pricing or selection to be anything close to their US counterparts. The Cabelas I've been to Stateside are in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Those stores are between 225,000 and 250,000 sqft and are amazing to check out. The new Barrie location will be 70,000sqft and while that's better than nothing, it's half the size of BPS in Vaughn."
827948,davey buoy,2014-01-01 19:40:00,5505,"For me it will be pricing.I drive the 400 south every day.BPS, Sail or Cabelas???6 of one /half dozen of the other. At least it should add more competiton!!!!"
827949,misfish,2014-01-01 19:42:00,29133,"Looking at the size of the building,Im thinking it,s going to be two levels. Something like sail."
