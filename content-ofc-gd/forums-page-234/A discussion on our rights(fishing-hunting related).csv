Since I've owned a drivers licence rarely has anything been cost effective, and that is even more true today with gas over 5 a gal rather than putting 2 bucks in that old 68 beetle for the weekend.

I truly believe conservation laws wouldn't be needed if most consumed game when needed... 100% AGREE with this statement. As needed is the key. its the palukas who get greedy that ruin it for everyone. I remember as a kid going to the marina fishing around the channels watching the old guys come in with cooler(S) full of walleye and perch. sure they were saving some money not going to the grocery store to get meat but that is shear greed. Even then I knew there was something wrong with that.My grandad and dad use to take me fishing and they wold pack things to prepare a shore meal. and that was our supper. catch a fish or 2 fry some chips with some fresh fish.  Keep Just enough for a nice meal, throw the rest back."

Of course every single person on here would break the rules if their family was starving. But that isn't the case, so why pretend. The rules are set in place to protect our country's resources, otherwise many fisheries would be destroyed from over harvest. I don't understand the mentality of having to keep everything that is caught ( within the limit) I enjoy eating fish as much as the next guy, but I am 95% catch and release.
