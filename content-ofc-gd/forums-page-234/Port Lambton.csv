I was to lake st Clair once last year on a musky charter and know very little, even less about the st Clair river which is where port lambton is situated. Can anyone tell me what I may be able to expect while there? Is my 14' tinny suitable, or even launch able in this  area.? Is there much fishing in the river, or is too much dodging of freighter ships? How long of boat trip down to the lake from this point on the river? ........as you can tell any help on info would be appreciated of the area, I know nothing and sadly,  considered the brains of our operation...hahaha Cheers mm. We will be accompanied with our 2 boys aged 11 and 6 and this is who I must look out for the most as to not wanting to put them in a silly situation. Or get there hopes up that this may be a fishing trip holiday."

You should pick up some walleyes, dropshot or drag tubes for bass, there are monsters in the river! Also jigging or casting musky is an option.. Sit on the dock with a worm or minnow, and you have a chance at hooking all different species, sturgeon, sheephead, perch, salmon, trout you neme it Running to the lake would be too far with a small boat, lots of good fishing in the river."
