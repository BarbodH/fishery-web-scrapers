Decided to troll and see how that would play out for the day.6 hours of trolling produced 2 oos bass,and 5 more pike in the 5-6lb range.Many smaller and larger were lost,It just kept us trying harder..This 9lber Shaun caught was the only one I thought I would pass on as it put up one heck of a fight,and I think photo worthy as well! What a day on the water.!   "

856189,davey buoy,2014-06-01 18:58:00,5505,"Thanks guys,nice change the last couple weeks.3 weeks ago out on the big water the jiggin was slow and fish were anything but steady on the finder.Figured with the cold lake temps they were all over the place.Water temp rising,maybe try again this coming weekend."
