856225,lew,2014-06-01 22:58:00,12766,"One reason it sucks fishing alone is its hard to get a decent picture...  Very nice pike indeed.  Pretty simple to make a basic camera holder  for when your alone in the boat.  Piece of wooden dowel that's fit your rear seat post hole with a 3 sided box fasted to the top to hold your camera.  Set the auto timer, lift the fish & smile  "

856232,LefroyFisherman,2014-06-01 23:45:00,602,"Pike selfie?, lew, not a bad idea.  I only held it that way so I could get an ok picture, would be hard to hold the pike with two hands horizontally and take the picture too, lol."
