856410,moxie,2014-06-03 00:19:00,1566,Anytime is a good time when tangling with brutes. Thanks for sharing.
856412,Gallie,2014-06-03 00:30:00,1215,"Thanks fellas, it was an awesome trip all blackflies aside. Most fish came on a stop and go retrieve in 1ft to 15ft of water. I caught the only nice fish trolling and that was with a big rapala off a 20 ft ledge. It was a weird year where spots that usually held fish were empty and spots that were barren held BIG fish. As usual the long wait to go back commences..."
