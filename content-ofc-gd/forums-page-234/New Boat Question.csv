856532,Matt Janes,2014-06-03 23:53:00,49,So I went to look at a 2001 Lowe tonight. The guy is offering what I consider to be a reasonable price. I'm all but ready to make a deal and my wife comments that the transom is not very high. She is concerned that our 4 year old is going to go flying off the back cause there is no height at the back like our current boat has. Do any of you think this is a legitimate issue? The thought never would have crossed my mind if she hadn't mentioned it. She says she loves the boat otherwise. I've included a couple pictures so you can see what I mean. Any input would be great. Help me convince her to get this boat!  Thanks!  Matt

856537,hirk,2014-06-04 00:07:00,571,"Nothing to worry about, its a standard 20"" transom, every boat you look at will be the same. There is a 25"" but you wont see them around here. Its because the side are higher it gives the appearance that the back is low but it isnt."
856546,Pigeontroller,2014-06-04 00:53:00,2793,Thats a typical fishing boat. 4 yr old shouldn't be unattended while boat is underway.
856552,dave524,2014-06-04 01:20:00,4508,"Your old boat has a full width, gunwale height splashwell I assume. Its not so much the transon height but the easy access via the rear casting  platform layout that is the problem. Not a big fan of eavestrough sized spashwells they put on boats today, especially if you are going on big water."
856575,Tim Mills,2014-06-04 09:47:00,476,I would nt worry about the transome.  Get the boat/motor/trailer checked out by a mechanic and do a water test to make sure everything works.  Check other sites to confirm that sale price is good.
856592,DanD,2014-06-04 12:59:00,2223,Here you go; a set of these should appease the wife.  Dan 
856594,BillM,2014-06-04 13:10:00,17367,I don't think I've seen a set of those since the 80's!
856595,Roy,2014-06-04 13:17:00,13728,It's a normal fishing boat. This is where parent/children apprenticeship comes in. Enjoy.
856597,DanD,2014-06-04 13:20:00,2223,I don't think I've seen a set of those since the 80's!  Wave Whacker and White Cap still make them.  Dad.
856676,aplumma,2014-06-04 21:22:00,6896,A good life vest and if you want a dog leash clipped to the center of the boat while under way will make everyone happy.    Art
856725,BillM,2014-06-05 01:45:00,17367, Wave Whacker and White Cap still make them.  Dad.  I remember Linder used to promote those things like crazy on the In-Fisherman when I was a kid.
856730,Rizzo,2014-06-05 01:59:00,4754,"just drag junior behind the boat on a tube, prevents awkward ""falling out of boat discussions"" with wife. Good luck, looks like a nice boat!"
