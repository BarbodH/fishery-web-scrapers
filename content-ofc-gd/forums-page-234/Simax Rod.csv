The main reason i am posting is because i am trying t get a hold of them for the warranty, the warranty email and number they gave me is fake and is not working, i am wondering if anyone knows how to get a hold of them? I am quite disappointed with them at the moment, i thought they would have better customer service., thanks for any help."

Will give them a call right now.                                                                                                                           Edit: they said that apparently the exclusive series was discontinued and that they can give me the wizard for 25 bucks extra if i come to their Markham office, only thing is that its 60 bucks cheaper than my rod so I'm not sure what the point is in that, on a side note, does anybody know what i can do about a broken bottom section. Its broken at the connecting piece, connecting piece is gone , other than that its in good shape as is the upper section, any ideas? Thanks."
