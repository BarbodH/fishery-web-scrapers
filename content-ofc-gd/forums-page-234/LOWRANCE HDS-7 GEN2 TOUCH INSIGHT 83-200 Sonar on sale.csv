856647,DRIFTER_016,2014-06-04 19:03:00,10439,GREAT!!!! I have no money!!! Cabin material purchases add up pretty fast here. â€‹And even worse are those unplanned expenses. My espresso machine broke yesterday and I had to fork out over $1200 for a new one.

856678,Lape0019,2014-06-04 21:30:00,647,"I got that email to. It still qualifieds for the $200.00 mail in rebate as well which makes this a pretty sweet deal!  I am also one of those with no funds for such a purchase but if I could, it would be awesome"
856688,porkpie,2014-06-04 22:31:00,2521,With the rebate it is a screaming deal.  I just can't justify it having upgraded just last year.
856690,grimsbylander,2014-06-04 22:58:00,3016,I wish it was the 9 on sale. That's a great deal though.

856766,steelhedrmatt,2014-06-05 11:29:00,278,Out of curiosity....Does anyone know if the plugs for power and transducer are the same as The HDS5 Gen2??  I would hate to have to fish all new wires in my boat..  I'll be going to look at this today...
856768,fishindevil,2014-06-05 11:42:00,6254,ok thanks
856788,fishnsled,2014-06-05 14:47:00,3520,Anyone heard of any problems with the touch screen?  Pretty sweet deal with the rebate.  Does one really need a kidney?  Down to one since the divorce.
856807,mattp33,2014-06-05 18:19:00,290,no downscan ducer tho

They work really well actually except for when I installed an aftermarket screen saver.....not good at all.  This is my second year with my HDS9 touch and they do get a bit slimy sometimes with fishy hands.  You just need to clean them carefully to prevent scratching but so far so good.
