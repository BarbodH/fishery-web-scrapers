He like to ""feed"" the fishies. He would grab the worm and just throw it to the fish. He was able to reel in his fish and quite happy to hold them. Still, I am convinced he likes the worms better....He'd grab them with no hesitation. We went twice and he looks likes fishing with dad  , bonus!       Companion #2 My nephew Daniel and I went on the sat of the long weekend . I was very happy  he was taking fishing with a keen interest. Taught him a few knots, how to fish with the float he was more than happy to listen and be patient. I was doing more rigging and re tying but the company was great i didn't mind. We were at a beautiful river and was  scaling some boulders and a few steep inclines....was a great day to spend time with my nephew     It's quite priceless fishing with the both of them. I had a blast"

856301,spinnerdoc,2014-06-02 13:20:00,556,Thanks guys. Having fun was at the top of the list.  Gerritt I think at that age you really have to teach safety. They just go for the water...no matter how deep it is.
