Thought at first we were onto something, but turned out, it was just a tanning day mostly. Just a bit of residual kype   and then, well, great day for some tanning and photo-shooting    a couple from last weekend     Notice the tackle - it defies the odds how often I say, well, what shall we switch up, and something hits one of the other rods. Should be finding our groove any day now. "

855012,misfish,2014-05-24 19:01:00,29133,Yup nice day to get out. Way to go boys.  No alarm clock here too. Up at 4:30 am .
855014,kickingfrog,2014-05-24 19:17:00,8333,Funny how an early fish can turn into a slow day.  Fishin' will sometimes drive you nuts.  Beats a day at home cutting the grass and popping weeds.
855015,Tim Mills,2014-05-24 19:24:00,476,Nice team work on those fish.  New boat and rigging looks like its paying off.  Keep the reports coming.
856603,G-Man,2014-06-04 14:19:00,47,good day on the lake that day
