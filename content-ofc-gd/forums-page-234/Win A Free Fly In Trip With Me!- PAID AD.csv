855122,Big Cliff,2014-05-25 18:43:00,6899,"Just a thought! if I win I would take Beans! SERIOUSLY! I'll bet he tops most DD's, (last time I looked I'd have guesed at about a 48 EEE) he loves to fish, he isn't a bad cook, he is a great fisherman, he'd never complain about my snoring (he probably wouldn't even hear it) and I can't think of a person that would appreciate it more or that deserves it more!  I think that no mater who wins they should include Beans!"

According to OOD there were a lot of entries, over 5000 I believe. I'd be willing to bet the majority came from this board. I know they were very happy as well.  Here's hoping the trip is a successful one!  In the meantime I'm headed to White River early Thursday for another fly in, this one for lakers. Prepping for that one right now."

Ignorant I'm sure, but honest none the less.  Can I take my Father or Son or Daughter? This is the best post on the thread. I would love to go but rule 8 is in the way.

There's probably many people who don't know who I am, although I'm somewhat surprised that a regular on this board wouldn't.  As far as why you'd want to fish with me at Anjigaming, I'm used to guiding people and think I have a pretty good rapport with most. I've been to this lake in September before and am 100% dialed in as to where the giant walleyes are. There are good numbers of 10lb plus trophies in this lake. I would certainly do my best to make sure the trip is a success for everyone involved.  As per the rules laid out by OOD you can bring anyone you like as long as they're an Ontario resident and age of majority.  Cheers"

Two lucky winners will join me at Anjigaming Lake in late September for 4 nights - prime time for trophies!  This trip includes air transportation from Toronto to Timmins then ground transport to the airbase, so no long drives.
