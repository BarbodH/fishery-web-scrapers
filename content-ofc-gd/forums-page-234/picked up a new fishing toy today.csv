856145,porkpie,2014-06-01 10:53:00,2521,I've had that pair for 5 years now.  Great pair of glasses!
856204,redpearl99,2014-06-01 20:30:00,259,"yep great glasses, I had the same pair last year but I lost them one the first day"
856250,reelinrolly,2014-06-02 01:11:00,281,"Best fishing glasses I have ever worn, wont go without them!!!"
856251,skdds,2014-06-02 01:15:00,195,Me too! Great.
856286,Parnelly,2014-06-02 11:16:00,108,I dropped my Maui's on the floor in a shoppers drugmart when a worker came through a door in front me then turned around and came at me. Needless to say I shattered a lens when they hit the floor. They need to go back to Maui for replacement lenses. Definitely the best glasses I have worn.
856802,cityfisher,2014-06-05 18:03:00,959,I also have those Maui Jims + a pair of these for driving .. love them.  http://www.mauijim.com/shop/en/us/mens-sunglasses/stingray?showImage=103-02
