855603,dave524,2014-05-28 13:47:00,4508,My eyes can't make up their mind which way the vent is spinning. If I close one eye the left says clockwise and the right says counterclockwise.
855605,Steelheadphycho,2014-05-28 13:50:00,470,Absolutly profound thread.   Thank you HTHM!
855608,Carp,2014-05-28 14:01:00,1488,Stripper turnstile is for the birds.
855630,bassassin,2014-05-28 17:12:00,152,now thats a thread....!
855632,grimsbylander,2014-05-28 17:32:00,3016,"When that bird relieves itself, it has 14 new enemies.  It kind of reminds me of my boss."
855717,Old Ironmaker,2014-05-29 02:23:00,8243,"OK I give. I still don't get it. Maybe my PC isn't working the way it should be to display this video. I see a bird perched on a whir vane spinning in a clockwise motion. The other birds don't move. It lifts it rear once on every turn, relieves itself? Nothing here. please help, I want to enjoy as well."
855723,Terry,2014-05-29 09:02:00,14456,"that's it, what more do you want"
855726,Big Cliff,2014-05-29 10:48:00,6899,"Must be a liberal bird, it dumps on you everytime it turns around!"
855739,JerMac,2014-05-29 12:37:00,37,Hahaha good stuff!
855745,BillM,2014-05-29 13:24:00,17367,That's pretty funny
855985,Joey,2014-05-30 17:41:00,9122,"This one too needs no comment, although I think it is a gazelle and not a goat!  (I could be wrong though  )   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7-6nXGflec"
856010,Steelheadphycho,2014-05-30 22:38:00,470,It's a baaaaaaaaaack pack.........
856024,Terry,2014-05-31 00:54:00,14456,I thought it was a goat coat
856028,Steelheadphycho,2014-05-31 01:19:00,470,  Indeed!
856131,HTHM,2014-06-01 01:23:00,4082,You just KNOW that goat is gonna relieve itself on the journey...
856135,Steelheadphycho,2014-06-01 02:39:00,470,"BAHAHAHAHA!!!!!! Dude be like "" maybe this was a bad idea"""
856215,aplumma,2014-06-01 22:13:00,6896,A small known fact is that a goat held vertical as well as a sheep are docile and very easy to handle.   Art
856222,Big Cliff,2014-06-01 22:47:00,6899,If I'm held vertically I just don't fall down!
856228,SirCranksalot,2014-06-01 23:23:00,3291,"You just KNOW that goat is gonna relieve itself on the journey...  I guess he never heard the expression""horny as a buck goat'!  Let's hope the goat doesn't 'get any ideas' while riding!"
