The Laker bite was tough and the wind kicked up pretty fast making trolling almost impossible, so it was a short outing. Marked lots but they had a bad case of lock jaw lol.  Still a great day and the boat was running tip top which was nice to see.  This ones going in the pan tonight!  "

Skunked Sat morning, caught 3 and kept 1 21 inches Sun morning, all 3 in 20 minutes off the same spot.  Surface temp was 14-16 C.  Maybe 30 feet down on the leadcore on a bomber minnow bait. Found out have to take the shaft cowling off to change the spark plugs on my 2013 Honda 15 HP outboard.  So much for changing a sparkplug with the boat in the water."
