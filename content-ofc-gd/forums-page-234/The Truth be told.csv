The guy who says he wants to sve taxpayers' money in one breath says he'll spend money on a useless Royal commission on the gas plant scandal in the next breath!! Reeeel smart, that young Timmy!!"
856103,Gerritt,2014-05-31 21:22:00,6129,I would support a investigation into the liberal scandals... Only if jail time is a possibility...  G

The Billion dollars spent on that G8 G20 fiasco---money allocated into fake lakes and Gazebos etc----still a Billion for nada----where's the outrage????  Other countries can host these for just over a hundred grand  Or this is good....ask a federal Conservative how much they spent on the F35??----they will ""CAREFULLY"" chose their words and say they have not spent a dime on purchase of these jets....BUT....the incompetent screw up in just the acquisition process on their part....One Billion dollars  Where's the outrage???  these are still Billions of your tax dollars  I still have little hope for any of them  I'm really not sure what's worse----Liberals with their hand in the pot.......or Conservatives being elected---not asking What they'll do for me----but what they'll do to me---that's the scary part  Remember this is the party ideals that want industry to monitor themselves to save the public fat----like meat inspectors with the listeria crisis or the more recent meat recall to Alberta----don't forget Walkerton  And remember the super tanker worth of oil running off into the Athabasca River annually  This is the direct result of self monitoring-----the conservative platform---Gov't saves money but the costs can still be high"

One month ago they pooled their money together and bought a laptop.    Never having been, but having heard all about Florida ,they just happened to click on St. Augustine , FL.  They read about the ""Fountain of Youth"" claimed by the Spaniards when they arrived there.  They collected up all they had left and sent for four Bottles of the water. As soon as it arrived, they drank as directed.  The rest of this story will make you a believer, because here they are today...................    No.......This is TRUE! Really! Would We lie to you? We have a limited supply of this water available at an incredibly low price of just $1,499.95 a bottle. Seriously ....  HURRY BEFORE THE INVENTORY RUNS OUT!!!!

She would have us believe that this would be a good investment of our hard earned tax dollars. This woman needs some lessons in finance me thinks."

I'm retired, I just had to work two back to back 13 hour days because in spite of all my careful planning and saving for the last 50 years I still can't make ends meet without the extra income.  Then I get to sit back and watch BILLIONS of tax dollars pissed down the drain! You may think that all us retired guys are all set up but I watched friends have to use their credit cards to put food on the table and heat in their houses this winter.  I'm not talking welfare bumbs here, I'm talking people that like myself worked our whole lives, raised our families, paid our taxes and watched our pension controbutions get squandered and now we get a whole $1000.00 a month in penson from our government. You try to live on that!  So, you go ahead and vote Liberal and watch more billions of $ get squandered and see what is left for you and your kids when the time comes. Who has what track record?"

856026,bigbuck,2014-05-31 01:07:00,2449,"Cliff, I feel your pain!! I have been a financial advisor for 17 years and have now changed professions to slow down and enjoy my family more becausecof my health issues. Most people do not really know how much money they need salted away to have a relatively comfortable retirement, I am not talking about fancy vacations, just enough to keep he bills paid and food on the table and a couple bucks to fix the roof if need be. Seeing our hard earned tax dollars frittered away in boondoggle after boondoggle boggles my mind. We have been hosed to no end. The public service is swelling too much. Real taxpayers (people who work in the private sector) need to pay over $1.35 in tax to pay for every dollar paid out to the public sector. Timmy Whodat may have his head in the clouds with his numbers but face it, he is a politician after all. Shrinking or at least reigning in the bureaucracy needs to happen. Everyone complains about Mike Harris and how evil he was, he did what needed to be done and is vilified for it. There is a lot of fat in the public sector that needs to be trimmed. It is healthy, everyone in the private sector is asked to do more with less, why can't our public servants. I can go on and on for hours on this subject but I won't. Suffice it to say, we need change, I am not crazy about the choices but I worry about our kids and what they will have. As it stands, they are being left with one heck of a tab."

856037,dhickey,2014-05-31 02:53:00,1038,Bigbuck hit it rite on the head.  I would rather be told what needs to be done rather than having some spoiled  brat blowing unrealistic smoke up my butt... With the state of our over whelming social system and sense of entitlement that runs rampant among most of the baby boomers as well as their kids and now their grandchildren its no wonder this country is on the verge of bankruptcy.  Now that I am into my late 40's I find myself looking for a person that has the long term vision and fortitude to stick to their guns.  I would like to see another group of politicians such as . Pierre Trudeau Rene Levesque Mike Harris Brian Mulroney  At least they had a vision and the guts to stick to their guns.  Any one else running for office of the kind of caliber??? I don't believe so.  Nothing but a bunch of brats.... Its pretty sad....  Don.  Ps    Go Chicago
856038,Old Ironmaker,2014-05-31 03:00:00,8243,"Big Cliff,  You refer to Wynnes plan to invest many millions in a company that was going to bail on a multi million dollar loan, I'm not familiar with that, perhaps you can name the company. I wonder how you would feel if that was the company you worked for and it was a bailout that meant you didn't lose your job or the pension you paid into for 30 or more years. I bet it would be a good idea then. I know you don't want someone like her to lead the province but one of those reasons you don't is ridiculous in this day and age. What are you going to do when a loved one of yours comes out? It can very well happen.  Hey I'm not a supporter of hers but for any politician your damned if you do and damned if you don't. The feds made a deal with my company that saw 100 mil go towards the legacy costs that the giant US Steel company inherited when they bought Stelco. It has allowed me to collect the pension I paid into for 30 years as well as thousands of others and keep many on the payroll when it looked like all was lost. Everyone was in an uproar because Harper was helping a rich US corp. I didn't see any Canadian investors lined up to buy us.  There must be an election soon. Anyone going fishing this weekend?

Surprising how many have no clue what that means. We lost our company pension in 2010...give or take...34 years and I'm looking at less then #700?month. Complaining..no....hoping to educate yes."
856051,bigbuck,2014-05-31 06:23:00,2449,"Fellas, don't even get me started on pension plans which several companies used as a cookie jar. A company pension plan should be just that, a pension plan, not some sort of reserve fund to pay for bonuses for underachieving ezecutive teams. The company Cliff mentioned was MARS, some sort of real estate deal thatvdid not go too well and the taxpayers are on the hook for the whole pill. 300+ milloon and counting. These sorts of deals should not exist with the government backing private enterprise that does not emply a whole whack of people. As for what happened in Hamilton with the steel companies, the feds and provincial governments did not put enough strings on their bailout funds. If the taxpayers pay to keep you in business, you have to stay in business or pay back the cash. All the retirees got left holding the bag, not fair."
