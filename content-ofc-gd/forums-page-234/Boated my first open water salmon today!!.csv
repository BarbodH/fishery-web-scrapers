It was just a little 6 or 7 pounder but it was a blast.   I can't wait to get one in the double digits.  It was all over by 7:30 am.  Nothing but over ambitious 15 inch rainbows smacking 5 inch spoons after that.   Stayed out till 3."

856314,Cosmos,2014-06-02 16:00:00,588,Congrats
856318,Fisherpete,2014-06-02 16:13:00,1814,Way to go bud! I didn't realize you hadn't caught any big ones before - we will have a blast when we go out!  Pete
856372,Freshtrax,2014-06-02 20:58:00,2215,"I've caught some big ones pier chucking ,   But not from a boat.    I'm new to to this trolling thing just reading what I can and learning as I go, sure beats chucking spoons from shore."
856374,misfish,2014-06-02 21:01:00,29133,You know we all like pics here right?  Well done bud.
856388,Freshtrax,2014-06-02 22:24:00,2215,Only pic we got 
856397,alphaalpha,2014-06-02 23:22:00,475,Nice work. Still pretty early in the season. Where'd you go out from?
856416,Freshtrax,2014-06-03 01:02:00,2215,Owen sound
856422,spincast,2014-06-03 01:42:00,3279,"congrats, nothing like the line peeling sound of a deep water salmon!. It can get to an expensive addiction, though... just sayin'"
856530,captpierre,2014-06-03 23:34:00,2521,How's the Lake Huron salmon fishery doing?  Was down for years.  Coming back?
856576,Gallie,2014-06-04 09:53:00,1215,"Well done! And expensive doesnt begin to describe it, i have dumped more money into salmon trolling in the last few years then i have on all other fishing gear combined for double that time span."
