Just need some good winds to flip the water  and get those lakers stable...  We went with a whole different game plan today. Get the hell away from the crowd. Right move for us..   Im not sure why he,s not smiling.He got the first fish of the morning,and is wearing his lucky hat.    After being skunked myself last weekend,it was time to break out the lucky shirt and bait.  Some good marks on the screen,so decided to play the chase game . Up rigger,down rigger.  Pay dirt.    Another and the same game. Catch me if you can. Up/down/up and BOING goes the rod.LOL   Yup,she caught it.    It,s only going to get better and better out there.  All fish today were stokers.  "

856188,Terry,2014-06-01 18:55:00,14456,"the small one for maps and the big one for fishfinder and sidefinder, I found the windows too small on just one unit, guess I shouldn't say anything about the one at the front ...lol"

Good to have similar units at helm, you can't beat 2 independent full screens and it allows for networking and provides an instant back up if one has issues."
