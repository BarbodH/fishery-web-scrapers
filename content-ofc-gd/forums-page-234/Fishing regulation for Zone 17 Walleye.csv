855790,JoshS,2014-05-29 18:37:00,729,"Basically everything Balsam side of the lock. The exception says it's applicable from the rosedale lock upstream to balsam, and then the trent canal from the rosedale lock upstream to the junction of the otonobee (rosedale river), which is the same water? I guess they write it like that to omit the rosedale river, which the regular slot applies. That's what I'm reading...."

Sure made a mess of the tournament on Sturgeon Lake last weekend...most fish caught were over the slot and had to be released...  One chap had a pickerel 1/4 "" over the slot and was charged 8 ounces off his total weight...forgot to squeeze the tail together..."
