856632,Headhunter,2014-06-04 17:58:00,5703,"Just a guess here Brian, but that design screams ""the rest of the vehicle won't outlast the battery, so who cares where we put it""! I once had a Buick Intrigue... worst car I every owned. Superior GM design skills required the entire engine (motor) to be pulled out, in order to replace the water pump. Well over a thousand dollar job... luckily, I got rid of it before that happened. Good luck Brian!  HH"
856633,BillM,2014-06-04 18:01:00,17367,Time for a battery relocation kit.
856635,Headhunter,2014-06-04 18:17:00,5703,"Which leads to a further question... say you need a boost, do you have access to the terminal posts under the hood or are you two inch ten'd? HH"

856640,misfish,2014-06-04 18:49:00,29133," On Mom's car there are boosting terminals where the battery probably should be..  Yup   Yup thats a plan Im looking at Bill. Funny how Dave talked about the nascars. Im thinking the same thing/idea. Run the cables to the trunck. Im sure a simple secure battery box (Like the ones on boats would work. Looking under the car,this is possible. Just have to check if warranty would be shot.  Now Joe,I seen you eyeing that beast in the winter. You know deep down,your a MOPAR fan.  Thanks Bernie.  I checked levels in the brake res. Alls good. Im thinking it,s the sensor for the hand brake,as like I said. If I just lift a tad ,the light goes out. I,ll be taken it in for a go through as it,s free."
856679,Parnelly,2014-06-04 21:32:00,108,My buddy owns a Charger with the battery in the back. They were in Vegas and the day before they arrived at their hotel this happened.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8xY_rzW9nw  Apparently after a high speed chase involving some gun shots the car ran into the back of a taxi cab(charger) which is the ball of flames you see on the video.  Needless to say they want to sell their Charger.

Two things I look for in a vehicle when purchasing, can I change the head lights and the battery without ripping apart the the front end of the car.  Guaranteed these things will go on the coldest winter day.  At least they have in the past.  lol!"
856495,misfish,2014-06-03 20:13:00,29133,"I have seen them in front of the rear tire. In NASCAR!!!!  Yup, with quick disconnects. I like."
856497,Bernie,2014-06-03 20:17:00,3190,"Ya, it's a lot easier if the car has never been driven in Ontario salted roads. Lots of rusty nuts and bolts.And if you are a car mechanic like me, try doing this in the middle of winter with a 6"" coating of ice and snow in there.And then the customer is peeved with the labour time involved.Ugghh."

Bernie  I,ll just wait for the winter drive up to the cottage front door.LMAO  The car is from NS. No salted roads. It was totally soaked with Crown rust proofing right after I bought it. It looks real clean from what I can see. I can see the top of the battery. Theres another video that shows it not so intense to remove. Still have to remove the wheel well and loosen off the bumper.  The battery is so small. I can see why I had some hard starts this COLD winter."
856500,Bernie,2014-06-03 20:28:00,3190,"I wish everyone undercoated their cars Brian.Makes it a little messier to work on, but the parts come apart easier.I hate getting out the hot wrench to take stuff off."

856502,misfish,2014-06-03 20:48:00,29133,"Yes it,s a bit messy Bernie,but it sure helps with the resale.  The only reason I was looking for the battery,is do to the light was coming on. It comes and goes ever since I had it under coated. I turn all the lights on,signals and brake,and the volts never drop. Any reason for this Bernie?  I have bumper to bumper warranty. Maybe it,s just a sensor? I have the same thing with the brake light. When I pull up a tad on the parking brake,,it goes out,then comes back then it,s gone.."
856504,Bernie,2014-06-03 20:51:00,3190,What light was coming on?
856506,misfish,2014-06-03 20:53:00,29133,Battery symbol and the brake one.  They come up randomly
856511,NightCrawler,2014-06-03 21:50:00,15,"Drifter said it,its a chrysler! I only buy foreign cars...i know i know not good for supporting the economy, but honestly, I drive a Toyota/Honda and for work I drive Ford/Chrysler/Dodge/Chevy...I notice such a difference, foreign cars are designed more to function easily for the driver, they put more thought and quality in the layout of the dash, buttons etc.... I dont mind paying extra for the brand"

856520,Bernie,2014-06-03 22:34:00,3190,"Brian.The light can come on for either overcharging or undercharging.It will set a service code in the computer. Read the voltage on the system with an accurate meter when the light is on and let me know what it is.For the red brake lamp, check the level in the brake master cylinder. It may be a little bit low.In the reservoir there is a float switch that will activate when level is low. I'd almost bet that is what it is. Use proper brake fluid only.  There are many makes and models out there that are difficult to access spark plugs.Fortunately, most only require to be changed very infrequently."

856522,kickingfrog,2014-06-03 22:48:00,8333,"Yup, if you kicked them in the head you wouldn't hurt anything!!  But considering where they put the battery their nutts are likely under their armpits."
856525,Musky or Specks,2014-06-03 22:53:00,2710,It's not a dumb idea. It's to prevent shade tree mechanics from operating on their vehicles. Because pricing is so cut throat  the dealers need to be able to make money fixing your car. Do you really see any improvements on your car from the computers that run it? No! now you have to get a diagnosis at a dealership or buy the software that will read the codes.
