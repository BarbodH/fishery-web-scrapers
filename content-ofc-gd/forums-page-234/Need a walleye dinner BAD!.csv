855809,jimmer,2014-05-29 20:21:00,2730,"Every time I guarantee someone a walleye after I have been slaying them, it backfires. Caught walleye all weekend and brought a buddy out on Sunday night.....nothing! LOL"
855811,esoxansteel,2014-05-29 20:42:00,1307,"I was finding last Sunday at least some very lite, short strikes, did manage 6 fish on the jig, but had triple the hits, i recitfied that by adding a #2 mustad Ultra Point short shank, and half hitching around the collar 4 times and epoxying the hitch knot. then adding the stinger  hook with a snell tie, and then tying the hair or building the jig afterwards, hook percentage went up to 75%, with the stinger picking up 50% of the fish on tuesday, If anyone is experiencing short strikes on hair, add a stinger"
855827,Gerritt,2014-05-29 21:55:00,6129,"I know about adding a stinger, done it a hundred times.... But I have no idea what the hell you were talking about... Sounded like a lot if Mumbo jumbo... Care to dumb down how you added the stinger to your jig?  Can't just tie it on and go?  G"

855940,esoxansteel,2014-05-30 13:53:00,1307,"this made me lol. I think hes talking about adding a stinger hook to hair jigs during the building process????    Thats correct Manitou, wrapping the braid around the bare collar before any hair is added, and half hitchin and then epoxying, the knots rest tightly against the point which secures the grub, or in this case hair to the jig body, and the stinger sits hidden in the SHORT SPARSE hair. This way I can make the stinger the length i want to fit my style of jig, instead of the store bought one that are all the same length in the package ie 3 to even 4 inches and usually with a small treble hook,  Its not rocket science Gerritt, and its not mumbo jumbo its a little hard to describe, but i tried to explain it the best way i could."
855941,Gerritt,2014-05-30 13:58:00,6129," Lol I wasn't insulting you:) I was trying to envision in my head what you were talking about... And drew a giant blank lol, I would like to see a couple pics of the finished product  G"

856439,fishindevil,2014-06-03 07:49:00,6254,Well were they slot fish ?? Over under or what ?? We tried to give you tons of info did you get your dinner ??? )
856449,captpierre,2014-06-03 13:13:00,2521,"all in the slot.  of the 8 that I've caught the last 2 weekends, all in the slot.  last year, about half were over  Had a couple meals.  the rest are filleted and frozen in water in a ziplock bag  I've heard some people add milk instead of water?"

854704,mike rousseau,2014-05-22 17:09:00,4661,Not sure about pigeon but I know on the st lawrence the fish are where they normally are on opener.... Just 3 weeks late

854711,fishindevil,2014-05-22 17:45:00,6254,you have the dpth right just find the new or emerging weeds and you are set

854779,Sinker,2014-05-22 23:56:00,8692,"Im sick of eating walleye already. Slow troll a worm harness along a weed edge and you'll get eyes. Thats the easiest, no fail way to get them right now. Keep your spinner as close to the weeds as possible, and keep your speed between 1-1.5MPH. If you dont get them doing that, something is really wrong!!  S."
854820,chris.brock,2014-05-23 05:55:00,4053,"How do you guys find green weeds if there's a chop on the water and you can't see down? Dredge bottom with a crankbait? just curious and I think it will help me too  We've done well on the walleyes the last 2 weekends, 4 to 8 feet, windy shorelines over weeds, suspending jerk baits (smaller seemed to be better), then trolling in current areas after dark"
854822,Gerritt,2014-05-23 08:38:00,6129,"Bounce the bottom, it works.  G"
854874,jimmer,2014-05-23 15:35:00,2730,Chris. I fish pigeon and know where the weed beds are when in full growth. Looking for the same depths and bottom consistency is usually a sign that there will be emerging weed.

854906,fishindevil,2014-05-23 20:24:00,6254,The fishing is on fire right now !!! Like I said find the emerging weeds or weeds that are turning green 10-16ft !!!!!
854907,bushart,2014-05-23 20:26:00,2628,here is a nice eye from this morning !!! Nice eye...what's the red line thingy under his chin??
854911,fishindevil,2014-05-23 20:38:00,6254,That's my bucktail jig hanging out the other side of his mouth !!! Hahah
854914,bushart,2014-05-23 20:56:00,2628,Cool--I thought you were shooting super hi-speed and caught a blood spurt or somethin
854938,Sinker,2014-05-23 22:59:00,8692,"I mark the weeds on my graph. Just run around a bit and find some. I like to be on a weed edge myself. The spots I go, I've been fishing for years, and years, so I just know where to be this time of year. Navionics, or the good ole depth chart is the best place to start if you don't know where the weeds are. Its not hard to find them in the kawartha's!!  S."
854942,chris.brock,2014-05-23 23:17:00,4053,"No, the weeds aren't hard to find in the Kawarthas. I was just wondering how you experienced guys find the green instead of the brown. I'm pretty sure you guys, Jimmer, Sinker and Shawn know your lakes like the back of your hands.  With all the lakes near by, I like to bounce around. Last Sunday I hit 2 new lakes I've never fished in 1 day.  can't wait to get back up tomorrow morning, and I'm up until at least Wednesday, I feel a little like a kid on Xmas eve"
854966,fishindevil,2014-05-24 06:29:00,6254,"Sometimes it's what we call ""a spot on a spot"" sometimes the fish will be concentrated on a small area !!!! So find the weed edge and drop a marker bouy and then work the area for example the weedbed may be 100. Feet long and look awesome but if you don't fish it all you think the fish are not there so the spot is right now pick it apart as the fish may only be in 10 feet of that whole weedbed or weed edge !!!!its kind like trial & error as not every weed edge may hold fish and if there's a wind always fish the windward side and as it's get sunnier or the day goes on fish will move so it pays to go back several times !!!!! I have taken fish on trolling drifting jigging and ripping so far this spring !!!!! So study the area you are thinking of fishing and cruse around and watch your electronics sometimes even weeds that are only a foot high in 15 ft of water is a honey hole !!!! Other times not !!!! And as for timing I have hit more fish early in the morning and I mean just after sunrise !!!! Like yesterday I had 3 fish in the livewell by 6:00am !!!!! And I usually fish till maybe 10am or so !!! Once the citiots and the sea-doos come out I'm usually already done and heading in !!! Or I use that time to cruise around and search possible new spots !!!! Trick is pay attention to details !!!!! Now go get em and tell us how you did"
