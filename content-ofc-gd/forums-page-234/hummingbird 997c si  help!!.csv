851983,Sinker,2014-05-04 23:41:00,8692,One word...LOWRANCE!  Im hearing lots of problems with the birds! Never liked them myself! I have lowrance units that are up to 10yrs old that still work like new!  S.
852002,miller,2014-05-05 00:49:00,223,"Try doing a simple software update using a blank ad card, if that doesn't help give George at Bay Distributors a call.  (705) 476-6010"

I have lowrance units that are up to 10yrs old that still work like new!  S.  Sounds like all the Humminbirds I've had over the years.  No fiddling (Like all the threads of guys trying to ice with the Elite 4's)... Plug them in and fish!  OP, I hate to say it but send it back..   Are you sure you've got the power wired up properly?"

Sounds like you got a lemon, just send it back assuming you have some kind of warranty."
852033,workwear,2014-05-05 02:07:00,592,ya bill...checked it three times....have enuf volts goin thru it....funny thing is that before i permanently placed it in its spot i had it working....double checked all my connections...moreted the connections than taped all the connections up....screwed the panel back ...then the unit decided to make a great case to be an anchor!  bought the unit used last fall for 800....
852052,BillM,2014-05-05 02:55:00,17367,"Man, that's weird.   Something has to be messing it up...   If you hook up the power directly to 12V (Say right to the battery) does it do the same thing?"
852066,wormdunker,2014-05-05 09:24:00,1711,"I have 2 birds.  Ice 55 for the winter & a 798 down scan & side imaging for the boat.  Both machines are great.  I had to return the ice 55 to Bay distributors once.  George was awesome.  I shipped it out on a Wednesday, it was back at my door the following Thursday.  Very good service.  He found the wiring harness inside was too close to the circuit board - causing interference, giving me incorrect depths.  I'm sure they can correct your problem."
856180,workwear,2014-06-01 18:04:00,592,update on my humminbird......sent it off again to north bay.....apparently it was the gps puck that was shorting the unit out....same problem last fall  why goerge didn't mention it last year is beyond me  anyways he repaired the same component and only charged me 35.00...  ran it all day  yesterday and it was perfect.....  thanks for all that tried to help....
856234,BillM,2014-06-01 23:57:00,17367,Right on man! Glad you got it sorted out.
856268,John,2014-06-02 02:22:00,2956,Was gonna suggest the puck. I have had a 900 series Humminbird for almost 6 years with zero issues. Would buy another in a heartbeat.
856319,Tim Mills,2014-06-02 16:14:00,476,Good to hear Peter. Its always frustrating when you start second guessing your installation and it turns out to be the unit itself.
