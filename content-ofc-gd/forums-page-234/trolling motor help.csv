I just didn't want to have any weak spots in my new setup. I literally changed everything that was associated to the TM because I was upgrading from a 12v to a 24v"

Sold old motor with all wiring and batteries and charger, new everything for me. Terrova is simply a two wire as it is 24V only ( not 12, 24v) Pretty easy and straightforward swap- new marine cables in 6 gauge from now bow plug to batteries. You can buy an aftermarket plug most places, West Marine, BassPro and wire it up..."
