856804,cityfisher,2014-06-05 18:07:00,959,Very nice Lew! ... keep some fire crackers ready... He wont be back anytime soon.
855148,lew,2014-05-25 22:25:00,12766,"Great picture manitou, I spose you see plenty of bears up your way."

855155,lew,2014-05-25 23:00:00,12766,"6:00am you must have slept in today.  Nope, 6:00 AM I'd be getting ready for lunch LOL"
855162,manitoubass2,2014-05-26 00:33:00,11391,"Thanks lew! Like you i took numerous pics but had to fiddle with them. @bushart lol, i hear ya but my partner was my 11 year old son, which means the bear charges in getting killed lol. @ kf, hahaha thats hilarious:)"
855165,bushart,2014-05-26 00:42:00,2628,I need a vid where caddyshack meets the big lebowski  
855166,OhioFisherman,2014-05-26 01:00:00,6623," I might manage either in a year? Then again, probably not! LOL  Yes it would seem a shame to kill it, but better that then someone getting hurt by it? Luckily the ones I have seen were from a distance, and I was usually on the water. "

LOL  I got charged by one of my neighbor's horses that got loose once, defending my territory with a gun seems like a safer plan. Those hooves look awful big close up.  I was with one of my uncles one time at Pointe au Baril and he wanted to get a closer look at a bear cub swimming in a shallow pass between two islands, no way, we are close enough and momma has to be nearby!  Don't fool with mother nature?"

855309,esoxansteel,2014-05-26 22:51:00,1307,"lol i agree. We use to have guns in Alberta up north to protect ourselves from bears, but laws changed and boy is it creepy to be alone in the mountains without a gun. Look up my old report about getting charged by a bear. It was so much more scary cause i had 5 if my kids with me. I had to set them off on a bush trail around the rapids and yell at them to tell mom to call 911. It was gnarly. My heart rate was off the charts for hours. All i had to defend myself was a fillet knife, so, certain death if that bear decided that was my fate. On a side note, a bear here a few days ago was hit by a train. Left split nearly in two on the tracks. I called MNR and they would do nothing. I called CN police and they showed up, threw the bear 10 feet off the tracks and left. So disappointing. So me along with 4 others dug a grave, away from homes, laid some tobacco and burried it. Boy did it smell as i lifted it onto the gator, wow. Small bear though maybe 130lbs. Burying it was nice though. Nice to show and feel that respect for one another. Poor bear     Way to go Manitou, and the 4 wise men, paying respect to one of Gods creations, when one group of civil servants would do nothing, and the other through the carcass 10 feet off the tracks and left."

856054,Gerritt,2014-05-31 12:10:00,6129,Lew do me and the rest of us a favour.... Only because we like you....  DO NOT SET UP A HAMMOCK!  After you see this you will understand why....  I didn't know black bears were that far south.... Sheesh!  http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/31/us/florida-bear-in-hammock/index.html?c=homepage-t
856069,lew,2014-05-31 13:41:00,12766,"Actually saw that video on this mornings news Gerritt, pretty darned comical LOL"
856071,OhioFisherman,2014-05-31 14:21:00,6623,"Saw the hammock thing this morning too, great! Them bears know how to chill! LOL"
855068,lew,2014-05-25 10:36:00,12766,I went out onto the back deck about 6 this morning just to look around and found a big ole black bear snoozing in the back yard. I keep the camera right by the door so I got a couple pics before he took off. It was overcast and still somewhat dark out and he was about 150 feet away so I really had to enhance the pics to make him visible so the pics aren't too clear.  There's plenty of bears around here and I've had them in the yard several times but this is the 1st time I've ever had one sleep over        
855069,jbailey,2014-05-25 10:45:00,866,"very cool, thanks for sharing"
855070,Rod Caster,2014-05-25 12:00:00,5784,That's exactly why I have an outdoor dog! Although my husky is about as sharp as a 2x4 so he probably would have slept right beside him
855071,kickingfrog,2014-05-25 12:01:00,8333,A good host would ask his guest if he wants his eggs over easy.
855073,OhioFisherman,2014-05-25 12:18:00,6623,I am glad I have a better chance of getting hit by lightning than seeing a bear in my yard! That rascal looks pretty big.
855075,Big Cliff,2014-05-25 12:32:00,6899,Very cool! Must be some food around the area to be keeping them around.
855078,lew,2014-05-25 14:01:00,12766,"That rascal looks pretty big.  He was big, and fast too, took off like a scared deer once he realized I was there."
855084,bushart,2014-05-25 14:37:00,2628,"Your like Judge Roy Bean----ya got your own ""Watchbear""  Judge Lew??"
855093,Big Cliff,2014-05-25 15:43:00,6899," He was big, and fast too, took off like a scared deer once he realized I was there. People are often surprised at how fast one of those big buggers can move!!!! Just be glad it decided to go the other way. When startled you can never be sure if it is going to be fight or flight. At about 50'/second you always want to hope it's flight!"
855095,lew,2014-05-25 16:10:00,12766,"He was here in the yard again about 20 minutes ago, so he's getting a bit too brave now. I don't mind them at night but broad daylight can be an issue.  "
855097,misfish,2014-05-25 16:20:00,29133,"Wheres your BBQ Lew?  He might be smelling it.  Call the MNR hotline. Seriously.  He,ll be on your deck sooner then you know."
855098,lew,2014-05-25 16:25:00,12766,BBQ's clean Brian but I hear ya.
855103,bushart,2014-05-25 16:44:00,2628,that's a good sized bruin
855113,npt1,2014-05-25 17:40:00,220,"Hi Lew,  Perhaps if you tried wearing a Montreal Canadians Hockey Jersey, that might keep him at bay?? Just a thought."
855114,Big Cliff,2014-05-25 17:42:00,6899,"You see a problem, I see bear steaks on the BBQ!   Wheres your BBQ Lew?  He might be smelling it.  Call the MNR hotline. Seriously.  He,ll be on your deck sooner then you know. X2  Clean to you might be spotless! To him it probably smells like a Buffet!  Even a fool knows you don't get between Big Cliff and a buffet, bears can move faster than I can!"
855115,Big Cliff,2014-05-25 17:52:00,6899,"BTW Lew, I have a whole brick of firecrackers here that I would be happy to run over to you if you want to give that a try however, if MNR did decide it was necessary to terminate this bear, I would gladly accept the job of disposing of it and believe me, nothing would go to waste! I am not trying to be a smart ass or anything, I don't want to see this bear killed but if they deamed it necessare, the last thing I would want is to see any part of it wasted!. Let me know if you need the firecrackers!"

(tent and set aside while cooking up the fiddle heads) serve with a side of fiddle heads, oven roasted sweet potato wedges (bullrush roots work well here too, just add a bit of maple sugar for the last 5 minutes of roasting)."
855123,lew,2014-05-25 18:46:00,12766,"Unlike alot of folks, I'm an animal lover and the last thing I want is to see this critter killed, but if things get out of hand it may be necessary.  We're at the end of a dirt road that runs 1 1/2 miles thru the woods and my wife and a couple of other ladies walk 3 miles every day and they all carry air horns. I was never really sure if they'd work or not but when this guy showed up earlier today, my wife blasted the horn and he took off like a scalded cat.  I'm gonna keep and eye on him and hopefully he doesn't get out of control and end up signing his own death warrant.  Thanks for the offer Cliff and if I decide to try the crackers I'll definitely call you."
855124,Big Cliff,2014-05-25 18:57:00,6899,Lew. 705-928-8899. I don't want to see him killed either! I can have them to you within 90 minutes! The crackers do work BTW. we used them in French River for many years when bears came too close to the house.
855127,spincast,2014-05-25 19:41:00,3279,wonder if he's the one that aerated your downspout last year? That's a chunky one for sure
855133,lew,2014-05-25 20:28:00,12766,wonder if he's the one that aerated your downspout last year?  You've got a great memory LOL.    Or it could be this one that was in the tree with her 3 cubs only 200' from my front door 2 years ago.  
855135,lew,2014-05-25 20:30:00,12766,"Lew. 705-928-8899  Thanks Cliff, I'll call for sure if needed."
855147,manitoubass2,2014-05-25 22:21:00,11391,"Yep thats a purdy big bear! We ran into one in the golf course yesterday. Hit my drive about 30 yards from her, yikes! She had 4 cubs up in the trees watchin us too. Snapped a few pics from a decent distance. Getting charged once is enough for a lifetime lol"
