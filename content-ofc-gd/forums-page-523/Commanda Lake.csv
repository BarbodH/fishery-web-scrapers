595933,mattyk,2011-06-23 23:45:00,2110,"Thinking of renting a cottage on this lake. Just wondering what type of fish are present in the system (Restoule, Stormy) and more importantly is there a fishable musky population?"
595941,Pikeslayer,2011-06-23 23:55:00,1443,"Matt, If your talking about south of North Bay; the last time I fished regularly there was about 18 years ago. I remember decent bass, pike & walleye. Don't remember seeing or hearing about any Muskie though. Also, it was not a pressured lake back then but not sure how much it has changed.  Regards, Slayer"
595970,Mike01,2011-06-24 00:17:00,378,"Not too sure about Commanda Lake, but Restoule has some decent musky, walleye and smallies.  Stormy has the same with some lakers thrown into the mix.  Do a search on Restoule, I know there have been a few threads recently."
595981,Musky or Specks,2011-06-24 00:28:00,2710,"Commanda has no musky but the rest of the system does. Good Bass, and pike. Okay walleye and lake trout. If you want to fish Stormy Clear Hazel or Lennon you'll have to buy a pp pass to launch your boat. Any other ?? Pm me."
595996,guitardude_15,2011-06-24 00:54:00,16,Very solid smallmouth fishery and there is a good number of musky. I get a lot of pike but no size and some decent largemouth. Stormy has a very good laker population as well. Walleye can be tricky but they are there.
595999,irishfield,2011-06-24 00:56:00,26272,Okay which is it.. Muskie or no Muskie?
596000,mattyk,2011-06-24 00:56:00,2110,"Thanks for all the info, appreciate it!"
596140,bow slayer,2011-06-24 04:42:00,1074,"  no muskie in commanda but there is in restoule,stormy,clear and lennon."
596168,Musky or Specks,2011-06-24 11:01:00,2710,And Hazel though its more of a pond than a lake
596212,guitardude_15,2011-06-24 13:18:00,16,When you heading up? I'm there almost weekly
