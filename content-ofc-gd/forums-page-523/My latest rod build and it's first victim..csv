594109,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-18 04:16:00,0,"First on the rod...  Rod #7 in the ""progression of a rod builder"" was to be a med-lite 7'0"" rod for all purpose spinning.  I used an old school channel lock reel seat to pay homage to a rod my dad had when I was a kid (as far as I was concerned it was the nicest rod in the world).  I equipped it with minima guides.   Components were all simple black/gold including a plain black thread.  I've nicknamed it the doctor after my favourite brookie lure. Suddenly my OFC moniker makes sense doesn't it?  Anyways, here is the final product and the first fish it took (biggest of the night at that).  I'm no master builder, but I've gotten to the point that in a pretty reasonable time I can build a simple and functional rod for myself and make it look/feel like I want it. Thanks to spiel for encouraging words and help when I was iron out the kinks on the first few.  I'm sure it won't be the last questions I'll have especially now that i've started to prepare for my first custom cork experiment.      "
594112,Muskieman,2011-06-18 04:32:00,2472,Now that's cool!    Good lookin' Rod..  and a very nice Walleye to boot!   
594116,motv8tr,2011-06-18 06:34:00,2587,"Very nice, and the fish ain't bad either"
594141,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-18 12:10:00,0,"haha... the channel locks definitely aren't perfect.  heavy, don't always stay locked etc. but i can't resist their look."
594148,dhickey,2011-06-18 12:59:00,1038,Verry nice rod and fish  Good loking boat to but it would look better with a Boston logo on it.  Have a great wknd. Good luck.
594185,Rod Caster,2011-06-18 16:51:00,5784,It's nice to have success on something you made with own sweat. That's a nice looking piece.
594689,PainInTheBass,2011-06-20 17:53:00,102,Very nice clean look!  Keep it up!
594697,Spiel,2011-06-20 18:10:00,9065,"Good stuff Doc, happy to be of some assistance. Looks like your builds are coming along very nicely!  Also a nice reward for your efforts!"
594719,Moosebunk,2011-06-20 19:05:00,3970,It'd be great to do that.  Winter project in the future maybe.  Nice work and results DOC!
595403,GreenCanada,2011-06-22 16:31:00,375,"Great fish and an even nicer rod! I'm starting to read up on custom rod building myself, though I think that project will have to wait until the winter."
595411,Bly,2011-06-22 16:48:00,1556,Congrats!  Nice reward for a job well done.
595459,bigbuck,2011-06-22 20:00:00,2449,"It's a nice rod, that's for sure. And, more importantly, it catches fish, nice 'eye!!!"
595661,fish_fishburn,2011-06-23 10:40:00,1311,Looks great doc. What blank did you use for the rod?
595673,umKthxbye,2011-06-23 12:35:00,247,"Nice rod. I just my kit in yesterday and man, what a pain the guide wrapping is. Hopefully I can break it in with a nice fish like yours. I have one of my dads old rods with the same reel seat."
