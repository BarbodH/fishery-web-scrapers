595187,Pigeontroller,2011-06-22 00:16:00,2793,"Spend Sunday afternoon at the Hamilton Airshow, took some pictures of the vintage Warplanes.  The star of the show, the Avro Lancaster, one of only two left flying...The other is in the U.K.      Probably one of the most famous of all WWII fighters, the Supermarine Spitfire!    B-25 Mitchell    A nice polished up B-17 Flying Fortress...       P-51 Mustang    FG-1D Corsair    There were 8 Harvard Trainers there, they put on a great show...  "

595192,mercman,2011-06-22 00:24:00,7054,Awesome !!! Nothing sexier than old planes. Oozes nostalgia
595194,irishfield,2011-06-22 00:28:00,26272,"Thanks Dax!!! Enjoy them while you can, we lost another B-17 in a farm field in the USA last week. Had an engine fire that then spread to the fuel tanks and totally destroyed the airplane. Firetrucks wouldn't enter the field saying it was too soft and instead sat on the road and watched it burn to the ground. The Liberty Belle is no more...  "

595229,GBW,2011-06-22 01:34:00,8460,That makes me wonder if they used the real one in the movies at all shame it's gone as my wife's grandad flew back in the day...
595234,coreyhkh,2011-06-22 02:08:00,163,Nice pics there is another show this weekend in St Thomas.
595236,vinnimon,2011-06-22 02:09:00,2593,"Nice shots Its really nice to see them practice, while im relaxing in my yard"
595240,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-22 02:16:00,4399,"Very cool shots, love the old planes!!!"
595360,bigbuck,2011-06-22 15:03:00,2449,"Nice to see those old birds up in the air, I see the big Lancaster bomber flying once in a while here in Oakville. Just one of the 4 engines on it runs about $1 million. The old warbirds are getting more and more expensive to keep up in the air and when you add in the occasional crash, the fleet is getting smaller. The Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in Hamilton is a neat place to go visit. You can actually sit in the cockpit of a couple of the old planes there. Help them out by visiting the place."
595369,solopaddler,2011-06-22 15:19:00,8605,"I normally work in the control tower at YHM. 5000 people on Saturday, 6000 on Sunday, I was VERY happy I was up north instead.  All the gawkers make life miserable for us."
595490,misfish,2011-06-22 21:13:00,29133,"Very cool and thanks for sharing Dax.  Looks like a better show then the Borden one,but will still go to it."
595503,lew,2011-06-22 21:33:00,12766," Thanks Dax, some really great pictures there.  I worked at Toronto airport back in '67 and we had a Mitchell stored in our hanger. Lotsa history to go along with those old girls and I'd sometimes sit in the cockpit and wonder if she was involved in any of the fighting during the war.  She was bought by the Confederate AirForce from Texas  and I stood on the ramp and watched her take off and that was definetely a sight to see.  She was refurbished and I spose there's even a chance the one in your pictures is the same one."
595541,HTHM,2011-06-22 23:58:00,4082,"Living next door to the airport as i do, I enjoyed the aircraft going over at 200 - 500'. So did the people who parked on my ""back 40"" and CLEANED up after themselves. We had 30 people on saturday and 40 ish on Sunday between services. Fun times! A brother in law is a lear jet captain so we had a running commentary during the show."
595594,BUSTER,2011-06-23 01:58:00,1336,"Wish I would have went.... Nice pics, were you in Vip?"
595658,perodimi,2011-06-23 10:06:00,124,"Here's another cool link:  Lancaster Flight  I work wih a few guys that fly the Lancaster, the PBY Catalina (Canso in Canada) and the P-51 Mustang, lucky saps!"
595660,lew,2011-06-23 10:33:00,12766,"Thanks for the Lancaster video Peter, I always thought that was a very impressive plane and used to see it flying over Toronto for the Ex.  I saw a TV show one time about ww2 planes and they rated the P-51 as one of the most important planes of the war as it was the 1st fighter escort that was able to take the bombers deep into Germany & back again. Before the Mustang, no escort could fly that far."
