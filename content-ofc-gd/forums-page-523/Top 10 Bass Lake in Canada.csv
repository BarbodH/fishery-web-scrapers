We have relocated and will not be doing ice fishing on Cooks Bay from here on... We are on Lake Weslemkoon near the Bancroft area.  This is one of the top 10 bass lakes in Canada.  We have a small cottage resort and offer fishing in the summer for bass and trout, fall hunting for bear, moose, deer and this year Elk opens!  There is also perch in this lake and Whitey will run some huts as well.  We hope you will check us out.  We have some people coming for bass opener and we will post on how productive this lake is.  Our new place is www.hiddencovecottageresort.com  Check us out and come on up for some bass fishing, or fall hunting.  Cheers, Whitey and Wifey."
