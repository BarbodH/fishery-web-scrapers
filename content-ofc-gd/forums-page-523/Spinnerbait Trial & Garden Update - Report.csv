Rain was coming down lightly throughout the afternoon and as soon as I got home it was still raining but Paul's car and boat was parked in front of the house    so I knew right then and there we were going out no matter what  Got the gear out to the car and the way we go.  Rain was still slightly coming down but it didn't matter... once at destination, got Paul's boat launched and I immediately tied on a white & pink tip spinnerbait  Haven't been in that part of the river a couple of years and it sure was nice to be back there    Didn't take long for the action to start once we located them     We tried casting to shore but the weeds had grown to a phenomenal length so we decided to target the outside of the weed edge and low and behold they were there waiting to smash our offerings  We went 8 for 20 (snot rockets)   Paul got 6 and I got 2 on my spinnerbait (chartreusse & orange tip)   Paul even got an OOS LMB that was release at boat side (man if only it was 4 - 5 hours later  )  All pike were released and not picture worthy but Paul got a shot of one I caught and I'm sure will post it later    Right now, were into a thunderstorm and thankful we didn't decide to go out today  Now for some garden update.... well it's been a month since I planted the tomatoes, sweet peppers, wax beans, cucumbers and zucchinies.... here are the pics of it:  Tomatoes quatriple in size and have already started to blossom      Wax beans enjoyed the hot sun and came out to peek    Peppers are doing great too    Even have fruits on the plants    Cucumbers started to run    Zuchinnies are doing fine    I even cut the top of the garlic to reinforce the heads    Even the Macintosh apple tree is doing great    Lots of fruits on it      That is all for now.... oh    tomorrow is Qu√©bec National holiday and I have the day off   Guess where I'm going.... yep out FISHING Hope you enjoy Tight lines Leechman"
