596057,Grimace,2011-06-24 02:29:00,2020,Bryan Colangelo expected to announce later tonight that the Raptors draft choice is revenge for only signing him to a 2 year deal.  I really wish ge would have picked Knight.  Would have made up for the Knight that Brian Burke traded away (2nd rd draft pick in the package for Kessel.  To say nothing of the two first rounders).
