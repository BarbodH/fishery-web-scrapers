I had no real game plan other than to drown a few minnows and leeches, just wanted to relax and was having a stress/craving day with the giving up smoking thing.  With no game plan i found myself with the trolling motor down right from the launch exploring the areas i normally cruise past on the way to the main part of the lake. Right off the bat got a couple of bass.  Cruised across the landing bay channel with a spinner and got a walleye, then cast a jig and minnow at another 'bassy' looking rock pile on a wind swept point....found some walleye in 8' fow right under the boat.  Cruised another 100yrds on auto pilot to the adjacent point and found more walleye on another windswept point at depths not exceeding 12'.  I must have travelled a whole 200yrds and had non stop walleye fun for 2 hrs. Nothing big, biggest was 20"". Perfect way to forget i wanted to smoke and was back in time to give mum a break and give Jack supper/bath and take care of bedtime...everyone went to bed happy with a nice fishfry thrown into the bargain.   <iframe width=""560"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/b2Ic38rq54g"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"

596071,moparhawk,2011-06-24 02:42:00,146,Nice Simon. Well now I know when we finally get to fish together to leave the Gin and cigaretts at home. Gee ya think we could just have a blast catching fish? I need to quit the cigs also and am finding some motivation in your post. Good going on that and keep up the fight!
