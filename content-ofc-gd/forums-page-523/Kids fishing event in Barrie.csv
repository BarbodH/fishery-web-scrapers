Kids are invited to grab a poll and hook and try out fishing as part of Kids Fishing Day, presented by Tim Hortons and the Kempenfelt Rotary Club. The annual event, for kids 13 and under, offers an opportunity to experience fishing, learn about conservation and have lots of fun. “All they you need to bring is a fishing rod with a line and hook,” said Mark Campbell, from Kempenfelt Rotary marketing. “The entire day is free. We supply the bait.”  To take part, kids must be registered online. Each kid must also have an adult guardian present. The day also features entertainment, games, inflatables and crafts. “The Toronto Sportsman Show is also on board as a sponsor and will be handing out fishing rods for the kids.” Rotary members Coos Uylenbroek and Barry Peacock founded the event. Kids Fishing Day runs from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Sunday.  For more information and to register, visit www.teachakidtofish.com."
