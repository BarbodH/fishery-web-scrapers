596011,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-24 01:09:00,1107,  I prefer a cold water smally over walleyes any day smallies are great if they are 1-2lbs out of cold water
593168,Whitemikeca,2011-06-15 00:48:00,138,I will probably be out on Buckhorn - my go to big largie lake.
593183,Handlebarz,2011-06-15 01:39:00,3790,I forget what it was called I just know Jos showed me where he was going to be fishing so I told him to watch out as I would add spikes on the out side of my boards so he had better put a few extra coats of wax on his boat this week  If I am out Saturday morning I will head over to his area just to say Hi.

593345,Fang,2011-06-15 17:03:00,1330,"I bumped into a long lost fishing buddy last year and it would be nice if we could work out a trip up to his family cottage. Private launch for cottagers only and you could fish the whole lake without starting your outboard. My other 2 times on this lake about 10 years ago were very memorable. First 3 cast I had 3 smallies on, smallest was 21"". The lake is hardly fished as most cottagers are non anglers and being a smaller lake there's really only car toppers or canoes out there. South side of the lake is all rock, cliffs and shoals, top end is 1-2 miles of floating logs, duckweed, lily pads and undercut willow bushes."
593361,bucktail,2011-06-15 17:49:00,1857,"I am going to concentrate on learning deep water smallies on Lake Erie this year. I have a few spots but its so big it can be intimidating, would like to break the 7 pound barrier."
593365,kickingfrog,2011-06-15 18:03:00,8333,"Has someone already said: The same place I've been going for the last month?  Have fun, stay safe.  Bass opener doesn't hold the same appeal for me as the others.  I guess most of it has to do with the fact that I've been out on, or next to, open water for a couple of months at least by the time bass opens here."
593415,codered,2011-06-15 20:18:00,123,Very nice i go north of bon echo myself .There are a few lakes for smallies  and walleye that not to many people know about  . i'll post my adventures when i get back  .

593708,Beans,2011-06-16 15:49:00,3339,  If it is not too rough and windy I may be terrorizing the bass at the north end of Big Island or Hurricane Point myself (4 HP Mercury restricts things)  
593725,ehg,2011-06-16 16:12:00,2666,That stretch south to Big Island gets rough on westerly winds. My favourite fishing in Ontario all around there though.
