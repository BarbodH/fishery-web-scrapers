I have read about all the rocks but Iam not bothered because I have the navionics charts and it looks pretty detailed shows a lot of x lol  But I am mostly interested in finding Large mouth does anyone have and tips and or spots to try. Thx"
595625,redskullz,2011-06-23 03:29:00,55,You'll have no problems getting largies or pike in Kashe...now if slab crappies or walleye were the targets i'd say good luck. If the weather is sweet topwaters at dusk and dawn will nail largies. As you know there is a ton of unmarked rocks and the lake can be pretty busy at times with boat traffic. there is another small lake that is connected to kashe under a bridge that will be well worth it to try for pike and bass.(forget the name off hand)
