595398,LucG,2011-06-22 16:23:00,779,Just kidding...lol...What are you after?
595407,K_F,2011-06-22 16:41:00,107,there was a really good feature article on nosbonsing in ontario out of doors within the last couple of years.  perhaps its still available
595418,ehg,2011-06-22 17:19:00,2666,"There  is a fair amount of fishing reports from Nosbonsing over the years. Use the search function and type in ""Nosbonsing"" and many should be found like this....  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=53298&st=0&p=579754&hl=nosbonsing&fromsearch=1entry579754"

I have had very good luck just through the narrows on the small side. Pike,  bass and even the odd muskie are pulled from the point on the north side just through the narrows.  It is a tough lake to fish but their are a good amount of fish in that lake.  Stay  around the narrows and you will have a great outing!  Good luck  P.S.  send me a PM before you go as i might just be up at the cottage and would be happy to point you in the right direction.  "
595547,BASSKILLA19,2011-06-23 00:12:00,9,Thanks for the info matt and when the time comes around ill send you a PM. Do you know of any maps of the lake with depths and things like that?
595550,pikehunter,2011-06-23 00:24:00,1659,Biggest pike  I've ever seen being caught was on this lake....but of course that was about 40 years ago  Where in the hell does time go?
595555,BASSKILLA19,2011-06-23 00:39:00,9,You can only dream of pike that big these days:wallbash:
