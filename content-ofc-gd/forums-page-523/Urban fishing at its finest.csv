595795,Joeytier,2011-06-23 18:14:00,3990,"Suffering from one of my (read: daily) bouts of midnight-shift insomnia, I decided to muster up the energy to go fishing, at least for an hour or two, despite the past few days of unstable weather and an east wind.  So I packed up the trusty bicycle and off I went...   It took long enough, but was finally rewarded with a beauty Nipissing specimen (well within the slot)...   Sometimes all it takes is one....  Tough to beat chunky walleye within city limits"
595800,Rod Caster,2011-06-23 18:21:00,5784,Nice work Joey! I wonder if that's the same spot I fish from?? Are there other people fishing in that spot or are you in a quieter spot?
595820,umKthxbye,2011-06-23 19:15:00,247,That's how I go fishing too here around Kingston. Glad to see I'm not the only one biking to the fish. But my bike is a crappy $80 one from Crappy Tire.
595839,limeyangler,2011-06-23 19:59:00,5204,Nice one Joey. I'm on shift work too so can appreciate both the insomnia and the mustering up of energy to get out...always worth it in my experience...and by the looks of that walter worth the effort too!
595843,Joeytier,2011-06-23 20:15:00,3990,"Of course, Simon.  Even though you never seem to realize it until you get there."
595846,Nipfisher,2011-06-23 20:27:00,2449,Sucks when you catch only one and you have to put it back eh? Maybe you would have done better if you were wearing a leafs hat?
595848,mercman,2011-06-23 20:31:00,7054,You got that right Joey.Something about catching a fish on open water with the skyline of a major city in the view. Surreal    Tite lines  Paul
