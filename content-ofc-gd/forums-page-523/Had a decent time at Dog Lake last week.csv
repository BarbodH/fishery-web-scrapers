595228,10point,2011-06-22 01:34:00,165,We had some free lodging so we had to give it a try. I heard lots of negative stuff about the lake so I wasn't expecting much. It was warm and sunny all week making mid day fishing tough. I would probably go back again. It wasn't the quality of a fly in I am sure but it was fun none the less.  June 12th Dads northern caught on 4 lb line    June 14th The lure is half the size of this fish   There getting smaller   June 15th        June 16th      June 17th      June 18th  Look a Moose    The drive along Lake Superior

595267,solopaddler,2011-06-22 09:28:00,8605,Glad to see you had a good trip!
595314,green&orange,2011-06-22 13:44:00,31,Looked like a great trip.  Good job.  How were the black flies?  I am heading up to the Chapleau area in a few weeks and I am hoping they won't be too bad.
595325,10point,2011-06-22 14:08:00,165, The first day on shore they were bad. We had headnets on while getting all our fishing stuff ready that morning. After that it got warm and sunny and they didn't really bother us the rest of the week. Skeeters were bad in the evening.
595356,Dr. Hook,2011-06-22 14:56:00,18,Is that the dog lake near thunder bay?
595388,10point,2011-06-22 16:05:00,165," No, about an hour from Wawa"
