Last minute, with a gap between Jen's chemo and surgery and waiting for a date for same, come Tuesday we knew surgery definitely wasn't going to be during the current week. I contacted Leslie at Lakair Lodge and with a bit of juggling and two days notice she squeezed us into a cabin. We thought of going up to our camp... but it was work on one hand or laughter on the other. We packed the truck, hooked up the boat and motored!  TJ... never changes!    Says it all..    TJ, Joey and Paul.    Misfish telling a tale... not sure where he shops!    I think they wanted to be blood brothers... seeing how sharp and shaving. Oh to be 13 again!!    Travis, Patsy and Barbara    Roy and Barb having a good time.    Decided to rain a little bit on Friday afternoon!!    I'm Canadian... I can still BBQ! Too bad I'm not smart enough to put up the driver window in my new truck!    I'm not gonna tell you again... it's a friggin ENGINE... it's not a motor!!    Rich, John and Barbara    Brian suddenly became the Captain of Joey and Pauls Pro-V. Here 5 guys and 2 women tell him how to operate it!!    Waiting for blast off to start the tourney. Had a BIT of pollen drop over the few days!      Carole and Sydney showed up LATE Friday night and I had the pleasure of taking them out on our boat for the Pike Tourney on Saturday from Noon 'till 3pm.    Carole caught two pike, for second place behind Chrisk that had three to beat her. Carole still had longest fish of the day!    Sydney caught her very first pike, which was good for 8th I believe in the tourney!    Keeping a good eye on the catch of the day!    Back just in time for 3pm ""measure in"".    Thanks John and Pikeguy for cleaning supper!!      Patiently waiting for prizes!    Mom... can I take the nice looking bottle??    Newt, Art, Jewelbee, Moosy and Jer    Sydney picking the raffle ticket for a Spiel Special... believe Jer won it !!    Chrisk with the Crayola Invitational Trophy.    In between the awards and dinner, I spotted this guy from our cabin deck and Leah took Sydney out to check it out.    Batter Babes... Debbie, Sam, Patsy, Barbara and ChrisK !    TJ's secret batter coming out of the pot!    Jer and his wife and dog Moosy. Sorry Jer, never did get her name..    Sunday I washed my skunk off a few times...      ..as did Leah.    And Roy... I've never given up on those wonderful baits that you made, and that you gave me, back in 2007 or 2008.    Another wonderful night of laughter starting up...    Dianne (Lew's wife), Barbara (John's wife) and Leah (yep.. believe it or not my wife!)    Monday we packed up the cabin and then went out fishing for about 4 hours. East wind brings out the beast and it did, unfortunately I didn't put it in the boat. Had a 45 to 48 muskie follow to the boat and for a full revolution on an oval before taking off. It was attracted to one of Mike Parker's beautifully made ""christmas tinsel"" spinners. This stupid little guy fell for a bait his same length. Makes ya wonder what they're thinking...    We've gotta go where... HOME... you're kiddin me...    Thanks for the laughs folks... we truly needed them!"
