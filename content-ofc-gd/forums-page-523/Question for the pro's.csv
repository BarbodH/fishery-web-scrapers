My friend is going to get in touch with one of the group leaders and see what they think...I think it would be a blast.  Maureen"

I lost my Woggle, Scarf and Beads on one of my many moves  The Pro idea was more for the ""cool"" factor, but lots of good ideas here, and I will see what the group wants to do and go from there. Nothing will happend until Sept. anyway, but I thought of it today and decided to see what the response would be.  I'm srue the leaders and kids will have a great time no matter who shows up  Thanks again Maureen"
