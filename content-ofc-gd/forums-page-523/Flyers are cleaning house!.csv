595919,Rod Caster,2011-06-23 23:25:00,5784,"What??? Ok time for me to stop crying about the cup and get back into the game. Only 3mths to go!!  Edit: Just read about it.... Carter for Jakub Voracek and a 2011 1st & 3rd pick sounds like a good deal, as long as they draft well in this year's ""decent"" pool of youngsters. Richards for Braydon Shenn, Wayne Simmonds and a 2012 2nd....I'd rather Richards."
595925,guitardude_15,2011-06-23 23:39:00,16,"When Carter was moved I didn't think to much of it but Richards ???  I would have considered them a cup favorite for next year with the signing of Bryzgalov but I suppose they don't wanna win for a few years...  Schenn, simmonds and a voracek are all good so is a 1st round pick but seems like a couple odd moves, unless they need the cap space to sign Bryzgalov?"
595937,bucktail,2011-06-23 23:50:00,1857,"Move Richards??????    Dont know about that, he is the heart and spoul of the team, reminds me of a more pissed of Steve Y!    Think that was a bad move."
595938,Rob,2011-06-23 23:51:00,467,cap space to sign Bryzgalov?   Exactly!  Rob C
595955,misfish,2011-06-24 00:11:00,29133,"Just in, hot off the press,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Leafs give up 14 players for a goaltender,Tim Thomas,as they only need one goal scorer and a goalie that can stop pucks."
595977,kickingfrog,2011-06-24 00:23:00,8333,WOW! That came out of no where. That's around 100 million dollars of cap cleared.
595980,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-24 00:27:00,0,i expected carter.  he's been in rumours for weeks because of the bryzgalov move...  richards was strange!  no worries for me though. next to matt cooke i think richards is one of the cheapest players in the nhl.  never seen him lay a big bodycheck that wasn't blindside or from behind and never gets suspended because he wears a C.
596018,kickingfrog,2011-06-24 01:15:00,8333,Richards did appear to have much teflon.
596023,muskymike,2011-06-24 01:22:00,772, Wow
596041,canadadude,2011-06-24 01:58:00,769,Thats right clearing out some cap space
596081,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-24 02:50:00,4399,"  Wow I never thought the doctor and I would see eye to eye on anything hockey related, but I could not agree more on your Richards comments. Glad he`s going to the west coast!!!"
596093,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-24 03:01:00,0,haha... he's seriously the biggest coward and a total cheap shot artist.  he actually belongs on the habs!
596103,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-24 03:12:00,4399,I will take the high road!!!
