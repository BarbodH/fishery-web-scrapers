595563,shadowfly,2011-06-23 00:59:00,84,Hey guys i decided to take on my first project of building a rod from an 8wt 9ft fly rod. i would like to turn it into a spinning rod. 2 question  1) how do i remove the reel seat from the blank (factory glued) without damaging or cutting the reel seat?  2)I also would like to clean the blank before wrapping the guides is there anyway to remove the glue without the use of acetone?(I'm worried that the acetone might damage the blank one way or another.)correct me if I'm wrong.   thanks in advance shadowlfy

595677,Spiel,2011-06-23 12:47:00,9065,"  What type of reel seat is it, wood, graphite, aluminium?  What type of blank is it, bamboo, fibreglass, graphite?  and yes keep the acetone well away from it."
