The weather was absolutely beautiful, but the horse/deer flies were NASTY . I caught a bunch of OOS smallies (sorry but I left out all video of Smallmouth) while searching for splake, the water was gin clear with no weeds.  I took some video of our trip... hope you enjoy.

595828,rufus,2011-06-23 19:35:00,267,Nice video! You have a pretty good wide angle lens on your camera - what are you using?
