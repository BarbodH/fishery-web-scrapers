I am pretty sure I saw his face on the outofdoorontario magazine. But I can't find the thread here? And a stupid question, where to fish the beautiful gar? Are they available at south Ontario? Thanks a lot!"

595612,Dave Bailey,2011-06-23 02:50:00,1641,"I've seen them in the Indian River, south of Warsaw Caves Conservation Area. Nice river for a quiet canoe paddle, catching some gar would be a bonus!"

Seen tons in the weeds (the kind that look like reeds that stick out of the water) on the side of the lake directly opposite of the town of Tweed.  I have seen them there the 2 times I have fished on the lake 8 years apart (Once in 2001 and again in 2009), so it seems like that is their home."
