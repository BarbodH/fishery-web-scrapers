Really enjoy hiking the river, searching for deep pools where the specs are hiding...Haven't fallen in yet but came close a few times! The first pic is now my facebook pic!! Huge catch worth brag'in about!  Looking forward to tomorrow~! But it hasn't rained in well over a week.  I think browns are atop my wish list thanks to Bills last post!"
594496,kickingfrog,2011-06-20 03:38:00,8333,"Hard to beat brookies.  I made the mistake of having a photo of a brookie on fb. Many of my ""friends"", who do not fish and some who do, thought is was absurd that I had posted such a small fish. Some people just don't get it... and never will... all the more stream for the those who do."
594536,Rod Caster,2011-06-20 12:02:00,5784,"I caught few like your first photo in the tiniest of creeks yesterday.its amazing where they can survive..especially over the winter with no lakes nearby. An amazing and beautiful species.  Edit: Don't wanna take over, just add to your thread. Another little wee-guy.    "
594542,grimsbylander,2011-06-20 12:14:00,3016,"Nice pictures...I grew up near Flesherton, not too far from your area, and spent hours fishing the tiny blue line creeks for specks. Great job!  Dave"
595480,Lionized,2011-06-22 21:01:00,19,"So are Brooks and Speckles the same fish? Being new to the Trouts I just don't know. If not, the left one is a spec and the right one is a Brook?  No matter, they're beautiful little buggers.  Hey Rod, I think I've fished that spot! Hope u had bug spray on!!!"
595482,BillM,2011-06-22 21:03:00,17367,Brook trout and a speckled trout are the same fish.  Make sure you are fishing barbless!!
595487,Terry,2011-06-22 21:09:00,14456,look at those little fish how can anyone go after little fish like that   now I am off to fish for some smelt..LOL     just kidding haven't fished for them in years  but it was lots of fun when I did  nice going
595502,Rod Caster,2011-06-22 21:32:00,5784,  x2 on barbless hooks.  Lion: There's no bug spray for swarms of horse/deer fly's!  I'm not sure it's the same spot. That was 35kms away from anything on a trail that stole 2 of my hard plastic mud flaps. Now my truck has 50% more mud whip.
595514,BillM,2011-06-22 21:49:00,17367,"Also, if all you are catching are those little guys, I'd move.  Getta let them get a bit bigger before putting hooks into them, lol."
595549,GreenCanada,2011-06-23 00:20:00,375,Beautiful shots of by far my favourite species of fish. I would trek through anything just to get to them. The feeling I get when I see them or catch a few is beyond description.  Thanks for sharing.
595619,ah_long,2011-06-23 03:14:00,354,"nice, but just a heads up, make sure you wet your hands before u handle the fish"
