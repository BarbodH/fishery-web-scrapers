595066,Roy,2011-06-21 16:39:00,13728,"How about if you Google "" Bobcaygeon motels"" ?"
595260,Sinker,2011-06-22 04:40:00,8692,"I will be up there for the show as well. Are you willing to camp for the night? There are several parks in the area that could probably fit one more tent.  Birch Cove and lilac lodge are two off the top of my head. There are others, I just can't think of them right now lol.  S."
595270,crappieperchhunter,2011-06-22 09:49:00,2582," I heard 25,000 tickets sold Shayne. Gonna be a lot of extra tents up there this weekend.  I hope the weatherman is way off with his forecast."
595297,jimmer,2011-06-22 13:08:00,2730,"They are going to have shuttles from Bobcaygeon, Fenelon Falls and Lindsay to and from the concert, so you can look for lodging in those towns as well."
595302,Sinker,2011-06-22 13:18:00,8692, I'm going to put mine on your front lawn  S.

595354,chuckymcd,2011-06-22 14:55:00,144,im heading there as well cant wait! its gonna be a bleep show!
595400,danz,2011-06-22 16:26:00,15,"MISSED OUT ON THE TICKETS, too bad it would definately be a good bleep show Julian!"
595417,jimmer,2011-06-22 17:15:00,2730,someone was selling a pair on another forum for $150 or best offer. I can look for the details if you are interested.
595456,jediangler,2011-06-22 19:56:00,1923,I've seen them 7 times but the last show was a real stinker at Guelph lake. Hope they bring their A-game for those who spent the cash.
595732,danz,2011-06-23 15:37:00,15,"  Thanks, but I made other plans for the weekend"
595754,jimmer,2011-06-23 16:40:00,2730,"I am leaving the area, it's going to be crazy. I live off of Pigeon Lake Rd. and I feel it's a good decision to just go somewhere else. It will be interesting to hear the post concert comments."
595783,Sinker,2011-06-23 17:52:00,8692, Need a house sitter while your gone??  You could rent parking spots as well hahaha......  S.
595788,jimmer,2011-06-23 17:59:00,2730,Probably a little far for parking and we have been asked by a number of people about house sitting. It scares the heck out of me. LOL
595791,fishindevil,2011-06-23 18:04:00,6254,"yes i only live a few mins away myself,and i will be nowhere near,it its going to be insane !!! there has been people asking farmers,and everyone they can about parking and camping....the local motels were sold out long ago,i could go by boat and watch it from the lake that would be interesting....but id rather be fishing !!! cheers"
596094,Sinker,2011-06-24 03:02:00,8692," Yep, it could easily be done by boat. I though of doing that as well, but ya can't drink on the water  I've seen them like 7 times too.  This one is just for the whole ""bobcaygeon"" theme. The place will go nuts when they play it.  Don't forget about Sam Roberts and the Trews!  S."
596100,irishfield,2011-06-24 03:10:00,26272,Rent a houseboat Shayne... and we'll all come tie off to it !!!
