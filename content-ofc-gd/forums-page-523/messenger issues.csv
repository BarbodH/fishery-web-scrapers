595280,Jer,2011-06-22 11:55:00,1426,"I'm having an issue with the messenger on the board.  Whenever I click my profile tab in the top-right corner of the page, the drop-down menu appears only for second and then disappears and I end up on my profile page. It doesn't give me the opportunity to choose any of the other options: ie. messenger, manage friends, etc.  Anybody else having this problem or know a way around it?"
595283,Roy,2011-06-22 12:03:00,13728,"Working fine here, Jer. Have you changed anything recently? A temporary option would be to click on the person's name and send a PM that way."
595284,Jer,2011-06-22 12:11:00,1426,"Upgraded to IE 9 recently, maybe that's the issue? It hasn't seemed to affect anything else on any other sites.  I know I can still send messages, but how do I access any previous messages in my folder?"
595291,skeeter,2011-06-22 12:49:00,1907,"I too have had the same problem. I also upgraded to Internet explorer 9. I have mine set to email notification when i get a pm. When i cant get into my pm,s i go into my emails and click on the link to the pm from there. Then i can access my pm,s."
595295,Roy,2011-06-22 13:04:00,13728,"If either of you have Firefox, re-open the board using that browser to see if it makes a difference."
595296,Roy,2011-06-22 13:07:00,13728,Only 3.4% of our population is using IE9. It's only been used 17 times since midnight. Good chance it might be that.

595329,umKthxbye,2011-06-22 14:17:00,247,"Download Firefox 4, problem should be solved. IE is the worst web browser."
595391,bucktail,2011-06-22 16:10:00,1857,"Same problem here, you can get into it if you have a message but once you read it and your nmessage box contains no new email you cant access it, I had oe of the guys send me a PM then i opened it and bookmarked it.   IE 9 here too   Weird    Darren"

595750,Leecher,2011-06-23 16:29:00,7832,Have you tried changing skins from whatever you have as default to some other available choice to see if it works??  I'm using Firefox and it works fine
