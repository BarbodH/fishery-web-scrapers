596148,irishfield,2011-06-24 04:59:00,26272,Okay.. don't say I didn't forewarn!
596149,Roy,2011-06-24 05:02:00,13728,Sure they make them but a 12v 100ah group 31 is $1500. and all you're really saving is weight. Of course you can always cut back to a 40ah for a measly $900.
596150,irishfield,2011-06-24 05:04:00,26272,Exactly Roy... I know of these batteries from aircraft guys trying to save weight and ending up with a burning hull. I'll stick with lead and acid.. I generally get 10 years out of a battery = $13 / year !
596151,dhickey,2011-06-24 05:09:00,1038,OK..  Got it. Not worth it.
596152,irishfield,2011-06-24 05:28:00,26272,  BTW... most normal batteries just have the potential to explode.. usually when frozen and boosted. Lithium Ion actually catch on fire.
596156,fish_fishburn,2011-06-24 09:30:00,1311,"Total Battery sells a product that restores tired batteries and you will get another year or two out of them. I can't remember the name but it is a small bottle of pink liquid that you put in each cell and then recharge.  It's about 15 bucks and it really does work. Check it out, I use it and my batteries last about 7 yrs on average."
596157,lew,2011-06-24 09:37:00,12766,"For cranking batteries, be sure to shut off your boats master switch at the end of the day, cause if you don't, BOTH sonar units AND the GPS unit will continue running all night, and when you head down to the boat in the morning to go fishing again, your battery will be deader than dead....just like mine was at Lakair last Sunday"
596161,Roy,2011-06-24 09:47:00,13728," Great point, Lew. And don't forget to unplug your trolling motor. I've heard of some horror stories with TMs being left plugged in."
596162,lew,2011-06-24 09:51:00,12766,"Yeah, that's another story too Roy"
596173,Cosmos,2011-06-24 11:51:00,588,  Are you talking about this product:  http://www.totalbattery.com/details.asp?id=379  Did you use it yourself?
596179,NAW,2011-06-24 12:09:00,4022,"I wonder why the guy at total battery didn't suggest that option..  Hmm..  I know..  Now he has my $125 in his pocket.  Or, my battery was beyond repair."
595681,NAW,2011-06-23 13:12:00,4022,"I used to be able to easily get a weekend of use out of my electric trolling motor.  It's a 36lb with a big deep cycle battery.  This year, I can only get about half a day.  The usage I can get between charges has been drastically reduced.  I charged it up last fall before I put it away.  Stored in my basement, on a peace of wood. The battery is 3 years old, and stored the same way each winter.  It's been fine every spring, except this year.  I don't know if my battery is messes up, or if my motor needs some work.  I thought maybe my motor is drawing to much from the battery?  The fluid is over the top of the plates in the battery.   And it takes a charge no problem.  It just doesn't last."
595686,Billy Bob,2011-06-23 13:28:00,5865,"My guess is it's the battery....storing a battery during winter is best if charged at least once a month but even better if hooked up to a battery charger ""maintainer"" or even better if you have a on-board charging system in your boat...leave it plugged in all winter long....my boat is stored in my garage that is not connected or heated at all and I just leave it plugged in over the winter.  Time to go battery shopping....  Bob"
595693,jdm66,2011-06-23 13:50:00,7,"Billy Bob is correct, the best way is to keep the battery on a charger during storage.A lead acid battery will discharge 5-7% per month, where as AGM and gel batteries will only discharge 1-2% The only way to be sure is to load test, if it drops below 10volts under load it's toast.Storing a battery on bare concrete will NOT damage a battery, that's not going to happen with the materials used in todays batteries.  John"
595700,bigbuck,2011-06-23 14:11:00,2449,I'd say the battery is done. Take it to your local Canadian Tire to get it tested properly. It's not holding a good charge and will only deteriorate from here on in.
595733,Terry,2011-06-23 15:38:00,14456,"I hear wood drains batteries  concrete floor is better    just kidding..make no difference  time to buy a new battery, if the batteries a full of liquid  open the lid and check"
595735,NAW,2011-06-23 15:40:00,4022,"The liquid level is good.  How long do you guys get out of your deep cycles batteries?  I've been running mine a few times a month, for 2.5 years.  Is it unreasonable that it's dead already?"
595736,irishfield,2011-06-23 15:44:00,26272,"Too many variables Nick... boat pounding puts plates together... storage uncharged sulphates them and shorts the lower edge of the plates together. Whip the thing out of there and take it over to a local garage (or pull the boat there to do so)... they'll load test if for you. Offer them $5 or $10 up front to do so and you won't feel guilty when you find you have a bad battery and source it elsewhere (if the garage doesn't have what you need).  My trolling motor batteries are on their 5th season now. I used them on full speed on the weekend to troll for Muskie silently at 4.2mph for at least 3hours. Lower speeds for about 9 hours I guess! They still show ""Good"" when I push the test button on my Motorguide."
595749,NBR,2011-06-23 16:29:00,163,I can't recall a time that I asked myself if I needed new batteries that I didn't. I usually get from 4 to 5 years out of mine. To extend battery life check the water levels often and charge after every use.
595760,NAW,2011-06-23 17:05:00,4022,"Well,  I took it to Canadian Tire on my lunch for a load test.  The results said it was an ""unstable"" battery.  The guy said it's pooched.  So my next question:  Does brand matter with batteries?  This one was a Nautilus.  I didn't realize it, but it was built May 07, so it was pushing 4.5 years old.  I guess I got more use out of it then I thought..  I know BPS carries some, so does Walmart."
595763,irishfield,2011-06-23 17:11:00,26272,"Go to your local jobber and buy an Interstate Deep Cycle.  http://www.interstatebatteries.com/cs_estore/DealerLocator/Default.aspx  Looks like ""Battery Battery"" is the only dealer in North Bay! 245 Mattawa Street"
595768,Fisherman,2011-06-23 17:22:00,7201,"Neither BPS, Walmart, Cdn tire, Costco ""make"" their own batteries.  They are made by a handful of different companies and stick on whatever labels for the retailer that buys them.  The same battery that Costco sells for $10 may be sold at BPS for $50 dollars, it's all in the labelling and perception.  Some brands are better than others by virtue of how they are constructed, amount and quality of lead and other materials inside.  Don't get sucked in by the hype of spiral wound batteries such as Optima, when you check the actual numbers of battery capacity (usable amps) per dollar, they fall short by a country mile.  For the asking price, you can buy two regular lead acid batteries (starting or DC)."
595770,NAW,2011-06-23 17:26:00,4022," Thanks..  I live in Barrie though.  I called Total battery, and they sell the interstate battery, just with a different name..  I guess they're all made by Johnson controls, acording to the guy I talked to.  Their batteries are suposedly the exact same as the interstate, they just have the Total Battery name on them. (as Fisherman said above)  Their largest battery was $111.11.  $30 buck cheaper then crappy tire."
595771,Fisherman,2011-06-23 17:30:00,7201,"There ya go, now say thank you to that fine zoomie from Penetang,  , Total Battery in Barrie is a very good shop."
595772,irishfield,2011-06-23 17:31:00,26272,"Was thinking North Bay for some reason Nick... so ya plug Barrie into the dealer locate window... or go with what you've found. As Fisherman points out there aren't many mfg's left, but I've never been let down by an interstate."
595776,NAW,2011-06-23 17:34:00,4022,Thanks for all the input guys.  I appreciate the help!
596117,John Bacon,2011-06-24 03:32:00,3277,I have had good luck with Energizer batteries.  Many others have good things to say about them as well.
596127,NAW,2011-06-24 03:52:00,4022,For $125 after tax.  I picked up one from Total battery.  They where $30 cheaper then Crappy Tire.   Gunna test her out this weekend in Wuabaushene.
596128,irishfield,2011-06-24 03:53:00,26272,..and the bonus was you didn't have to wait for the geeks at CTC to charge it before leaving the store! lol
596129,NAW,2011-06-24 03:56:00,4022,"Hahaha..  I would have.. But there was already a battery in the charger, with a phone number written on a post-it.  It momentarily baffeled the employee on what to do.  Took him a minute to get his   together.!!"
596130,glen,2011-06-24 03:59:00,2641,"My next batteries will be AGM.  No leaking, no filling."
596132,irishfield,2011-06-24 04:05:00,26272,Glen has the right idea... but I'm not sure on Deep Cycles. We are now using AGM's in airplanes (and i have them in my lund for starters) and you can park an airplane in October and just fire it up in June. Not more than 0.1 volt lost over winter storage. You're gonna pay for them though... the ones in my lund were $300 each from West Marine.
596134,glen,2011-06-24 04:14:00,2641,I dont need one right now but i looked a while ago and i found one for under $200. They say you can use them as a deep cycle and i will.
596142,dhickey,2011-06-24 04:44:00,1038,Stupid question to start the day...  What about lithium ion ??  (like battery powered drills and such)?  Quick charge long life compact lite wieght?  Are they out there?  Looking to buy a good long life battery...
596143,irishfield,2011-06-24 04:48:00,26272,Google Lithium ion fires Don! That'll change your mind!
596147,dhickey,2011-06-24 04:57:00,1038,I need more than that. All batteries have the potencial to start fires or mallfunction.  question still stands. do they make lithium batteries for marine use?
