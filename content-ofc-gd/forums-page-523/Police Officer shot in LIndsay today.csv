595531,esoxansteel,2011-06-22 22:57:00,1307,"Now the special investigations unit which 10 members have been assigned to this case will spend countless tax payers dollars to determine if it was OK to kill the  that shot constable Keith Calderwood. Police are there to serve and protect and do not need to come under scrutiny every time someone is hurt or killed by the police, just doing their job. Scrap the SIU, as well as the Gun Registry, and bring back the Death Penalty, eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, the world will be a lot safer and richer if that was to happen."
595543,mattybculp,2011-06-23 00:05:00,388,"Keith is a buddy of mine. He is doing well and stable and is in good spirits considering the situation. A lot of details have not been disclosed  as the SIU is investigating. It is my understanding he was shot once in the leg and once in the chest (towards the arm). Keith is not what many would think of a cop typically being. He is a real beauti! does a lot of good things and is a guys guy. So i have no doubt he will make a speedy recovery, it just puts things in perpesctive real quick with a wife and kids at home. I will pass along your well wishes and look forward to the next beer with ya bud !"
595551,fishing n autograph,2011-06-23 00:31:00,2540,thats good to hear....lots of us were wondering how he was doing  and hoped that the press leave him snd his family alone
595552,Big Cliff,2011-06-23 00:31:00,6899," If I ever get the chance, I'd be happy to buy him one! Thanks for the update, please keep us posted!"
595558,hawk-eye,2011-06-23 00:51:00,141,I believe this post was to honor our men in blue who risk their lives to keep us safe. Go debate the legalities of drugs somewhere else.  I pray for a speedy recover and would like to thank all officers involved for keeping our streets clean.
595560,Old Man,2011-06-23 00:56:00,822," hawk-eye, you took the words right out of my mouth. Thanks for saying it.  Glad to hear the officer is going to make a full recovery."

595617,Rattletrap2,2011-06-23 03:10:00,1652," I'm not disagreeing with you, but I did get a chuckle after reading this post when I saw your handle ""liverelease"" LOL"
595618,Rattletrap2,2011-06-23 03:13:00,1652," Yes, great news! I just heard on the news at 11 that he should be fine...well at least physically."
595631,Twocoda,2011-06-23 03:50:00,4130, Death Penalty? Im sure David Millgard and his family dont see your point of view  Im glad the cop is going to recover ...it seems he does alot of good in his community without a uniform on as well  Speedy Recovery!
595654,fishing n autograph,2011-06-23 09:53:00,2540,canada's court system is too messed up to have anything remotely like the death penalty....
595695,jimmer,2011-06-23 13:56:00,2730,"I remember Keith as a volunteer of mine about 9 years ago. He is a real stand up guy, someone who epitimizes what a volunteer and community member should be. I have always remember him over the years as one of the best volunteers that I ever had the pleasure of working with. He wasn't a police officer at the time, but I knew he would make a great one eventually. I hear that Keith is going to be okay, but if his buddy on here can pass on our best wishes, that would be great. Get well fast Keith! Jim  I just can't understand where a person's mind is at when he just opens fire on someone he doesn't know, cop or not!"

595807,esoxansteel,2011-06-23 18:28:00,1307,"  Guilty or proven guilty by DNA absolutely the death penalty, would you rather have the tax payers pay to protect someone who killed a loved one, to be released in 10 years to do it all over again, what about Olsen, Manson, Barnardo and Ms plea bargain Homolka, theirs millions of dollars which could be spent on healthcare in just those 4 individuals"
595813,Spiel,2011-06-23 18:57:00,9065,Seems we've gone way off topic.
595444,ketchenany,2011-06-22 19:18:00,3229,"A Peterborough police officer has been shot and another male person is dead in the central Ontario community of Lindsay.  The male officer is in guarded condition, which is somewhere between critical and stable says Kim Coulter, a spokeswoman for the Ross Memorial Hospital in Lindsay.  The officer has been airlifted from the Lindsay hospital to the trauma centre at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, about 130 kilometres away.  A few people who appeared to be family members were escorted into the downtown Toronto hospital's emergency department around 2 p.m.  Kawartha Lakes police, who were also involved in the incident, say the Peterborough officer was shot about 11:20 a.m. near Georgian and Melbourne Streets.  The officer suffered unspecified injuries and was taken to hospital shortly before noon. Several people have been taken into custody."
595446,GBW,2011-06-22 19:21:00,8460,"damn, I hope he pulls through"
595447,NAW,2011-06-22 19:23:00,4022,"I hate hearing about stuff like this.  Hopefully he pulls through.  It apears a drug raid turned south, and shots where fired..  http://www.thespec.com/news/ontario/article/551729--reports-1-killed-peterborough-officer-wounded-as-lindsay-drug-raid-goes-bad  There's lots of articles out already about the event."
595448,Terry,2011-06-22 19:24:00,14456,"Const. Keith Calderwood, a member of the emergency response team, was shot twice and is expected to be OK, sources have confirmed."
595451,grimsbylander,2011-06-22 19:34:00,3016,I certainly hope he has a full recovery. These people don't get paid enough to take bullits from some low-life.  I wonder if the low-life has his gun registered? Then it wouldn't have happened...just ask a politician.
595453,Old Man,2011-06-22 19:42:00,822,My thoughts and prayers are with the officer and his family. Brave people doing a difficult job.
595462,Ben_Daniels,2011-06-22 20:16:00,435,Sad stuff...injuries and deaths from this bogus war on drugs need to stop.
595467,Stoty,2011-06-22 20:32:00,2910,Agreed 100%!
595494,fishing n autograph,2011-06-22 21:21:00,2540, thats what we were told at work
595496,Big Cliff,2011-06-22 21:28:00,6899,"Just heard, shot twice in the legs, once in the chest, expected to make a full recovery. Glad to hear that the perp won't, just saved us a bundle in legal fees! Give the cop a medal! He did what he is under paid to do!  Next time you bugger about the cops doing their job, try doing it!"
595501,fishing n autograph,2011-06-22 21:30:00,2540,god bless level 3 trauma plates!
595504,Big Cliff,2011-06-22 21:35:00,6899, Don't know what that is? Explain please!  CBC news at 6:00 is supposed to have full coverage!
595505,Dutch,2011-06-22 21:36:00,831,"I sure hope that the two commnets above about this ""bogus"" war aren't meant to infer the police should let these low-lifes off scot free and do what they please.  Drugs are ILLEGAL and need to stay that way.  The punishments for trafficing and POSSESSION are far too lenient and organized crime has their hand in the distribution of all drugs including cannibis.  Marijuana use is not a victimless crime.  These dirtbags need to be stopped and it won't be until people stop using that they do.  No demand - no supply.  People have very low will power and become addicts, no such thing as a recreational illicit drug user.  The drug wars like those in Mexico aren't that far from home.  For anyone who says alcohol is worse - not even close, sure from the addiction side, but it doesn't create the crime and deaths that illicit drugs do.  Making it legal won't help either - just more functioning, low-class, deadbeat losers on the streets for everyone else to support.  Keith Calderwood is a pilar in the community, involved in cops for cancer and a number of other initiatives.  He deserved better.  Thankfully, he is going to pull through.  The my father that shot him will probably be out on the streets in less than 2-3 years doing the same thing and that is truly bogus.....  /end rant."
595507,Roy,2011-06-22 21:39:00,13728,I hope everything comes back to normal for Constable Calderwood and his family.  I wonder if the perp was ever involved in trying to torch a police cruiser when he was 17.
595509,fishing n autograph,2011-06-22 21:43:00,2540, oops sorry cliff.... a level 3 trauma plate is a ceramic ballistics plate that the eru/jtf/swat officers wear in their vest. it pretty much can stop most rifle rounds....  the officer was shot in the chest
595511,grimsbylander,2011-06-22 21:45:00,3016,"  Hey Dutch,  Pretty sure the bogus war comment is referring to the fact it's a completely needless drain on society. We all agree that drug dealers and users are a detriment.  It is hard sometimes to articulate words in print as to how we feel.  Dave"
595515,Terry,2011-06-22 21:51:00,14456,"  I don't think pot is addictive  I know many people who are older and the not only smoke it the grown it dry it roll it and would never sell it..personal use... so  Marijuana use can be a victimless crime. and it's because it's legal that make victims , because there is no legal place to buy it criminals get involved  but cigarettes...and booze....guns..cars boats fishing tackle .almost any product you want can have crime involved...it's not the cigarettes that make the crime it's the people finding ways to make money on it"
