Numbers were good as we went 12 for 17 including my first triple header - we were all pretty stoked about that. Size wasn't there with nothing over 20 lbs, but a few teens were mixed in to keep things interesting. Anyway, one of the little fellas will be walking the plank for dinner.  Unfortunately no pics as the darn camera batteries were dead!     SS."

116726,silveradosheriff,2007-09-23 20:50:00,1025,"Yup - they were pretty happy with the whole thing! If they didn't know me better they would have thought that I knew what I was doing.....hehehe.  Fish starting hitting deeper and then got active higher up - who knew. Pretty much all metal off the riggers, with little to no action for the plugs or flies off the dipseys or the leadcore.   I'm looking forward to some quality Musky action next weekend - hopefully we'll catch more than a cold.  "
