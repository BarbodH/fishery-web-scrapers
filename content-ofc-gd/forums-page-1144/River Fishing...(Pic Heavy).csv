116110,tip-up,2007-09-21 12:59:00,94,It's been a little while since I have been active here and put up a report so I guess it's time to do a it of catchin' up to do  The lakes and small ponds have been on fire this season but not like the river. Brookies and lakers have been a bit elusive this year and the numbers have not been like they have been in the past...That's for another post though   I have put a lot of time on the river lately with my brother trying to find ''Bigger'' fish(Bass) spots for the tournaments on that stretch next year...We went into a few blind this season and didn't do to well  That certainly changed over the last couple of weeks as we found a great pattern for smallies and deep weedline largemouth.   Here are some of the fish I got into to give you an idea on how the fishing has been  ..The pic with the pike and walleye...they were caught on the same rig..                             Solo shots and close-ups                   -Andrew

116205,fatherof3,2007-09-21 17:04:00,1769,great report and congrats on a lot of nice fish
116206,tip-up,2007-09-21 17:06:00,94,"Thanks for the comments guys.  HeadHunter, the year is not over yet  Fishindevil, you bet those walleye tasted great  Just found a great new recipe for crappies too.  Frozen-fire, I caught my PB at a tad over 14'' this season. I'm sure there are a few 13''ers in those pics.  Roy, There is some amazing places to fish on the stretch of the river my cottage is on. We are about 20min from Pembroke, 1hour30minutes from Ottawa. Got to love fishing a river all summer with hardly no boats around ya at all during the weekdays. Weekend traffic is not that bad either suprisingly for such a big river. Were pretty much yanking these fish out of timber of rock pilings the whole time. The water is deeper and colder unlike the Lower Ottawa where your fishing heavy slop and thick weeds for buckets.   I can't go on without putting up a few photos of my fishing partner and younger brother Anthony or as some of you know him as, Jig-Head from old reports I have put up. We grew up together holding a fishing rod in our hand.                Dad with a few..he's more of a trout guy      -Andrew B-C"

116240,BrianV,2007-09-21 19:37:00,35,Those are some great fish. Hope I have a season like that soon!
116284,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-21 21:50:00,0,"Very, Very Impressive. We have some really talented young anglers on this board. I am sure you will do well in the tournaments. I too want to get into tournaments, but I want to fish for a few years rather than go blind, so I can learn the lakes. You are going up against some guys that were born on the lakes and rivers and know people that know people that know people that have been fishin the lakes for decades. So you need to do your homework....  Good Luck!"
