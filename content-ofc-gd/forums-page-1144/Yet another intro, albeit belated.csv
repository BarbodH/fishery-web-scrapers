116137,JohnF,2007-09-21 14:01:00,3494,"I already posted this, but belatedly realized that burying it another thread was dumb, if not an outright hijack. So here it is again, with my apologies.  I've been river fishing all my life, save for a brief hiatus from 1960 to 2006. As a kid growing up in St.Marys at the confluence of Trout Creek and the Thames I fished all summer long, then got away from it until a couple of years ago when a buddy drug me out to the river again to chase Bass. We've spent the last two summers wetwading the Thames either side of St.Marys tossing a variety of lures on ultralite gear for smallies & Pike and just having fun, looking forward to a reward of single malt for our putting up with Mother Nature in the raw. My buddy always uses Rapala minnows with fair success but he's slowly converting to plastic after being outfished by a rank amateur (me) so many nights. Probably the most interesting day out we had this year was wading the river just below the dam in Calabogie chasing bass and catfish. I don't even remember what the river's called, but it was pretty and the current was ripping and the rocks were slippery. It was a hoot, even if Rob did get dunked.  I used to do a lot of scuba diving and it's kinda fun to chase the fish now having an idea of how they behave when not being hassled by us surface dwellers. They have very little fear of divers so we get to watch them up close and personal. Most of my fishing is C&R with barbless or debarbed hooks. I just like getting out and playing.  I will try to keep the stupid questions to a minimum and if anyone is keen to wade the creeks around Stratford & St.Marys some evening let me know. There are a few spots sure to produce some smallies and the occasional Pike. I've actually got some boots and waders now. The water is getting a little nippy and I'm not sure, but I think the sweat sox and bare legs might have had a negative effect on the fish catchability, really. Perhaps I shoulda washed the sox more often.  JF"

116211,JohnF,2007-09-21 17:19:00,3494, Pics to follow. I just bought a new mini-dv cam for stills or video that will easily fit in the pocket inside the bib of my waders with a safety neck strap (just in case). We're gonna start getting some shots on the creek. The scenery is pretty even if there are no monster fish to record. Hopefully we'll have some soon of our first salmon experience up around Goderich and we're also going to go on a carp hunt. We have lots of them right close by that we've always ignored.  JF
