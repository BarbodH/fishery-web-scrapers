We headed out to area 51 where we all had some hits but finally my dollar store balloon, that BBR and I were using as bobbers, went down and I ripped up, yup I bagged myself a nice size snapping turtle.... luckly it came off with ease and didn't snap my line, then after some more waiting I finally got my new pb (my 5th this year! go me) a hammer handle pike!    But me being the wuss I am I was too afraid to hold it so BBR did and I just stood beside him hoping it wouldn't bite me. After more waiting BBR started shouting like a kid in a candy store as his balloon submerged into the water and he hooked into a nice size snapper too. After that some time BBR got excited again and pulled up a nice size largemouth.    So the Key to Area 51 is you have to get a snapper before you can get a fish. Finally as the day wound down and GB, BBR and I were packing up. BBR cast out one final time and caught a bullhead to our suprise.    All in all I'd say it was a great day and I hope to do it again before the ice comes."
