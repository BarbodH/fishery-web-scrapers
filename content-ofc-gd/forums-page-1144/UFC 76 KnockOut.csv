116527,CoolB,2007-09-23 01:18:00,47, Close but the Pride boy Shogun takes this one. All your other pics I agree with.

116576,Riparian,2007-09-23 05:00:00,269,UFC 76 Knockout...  every fight went to the judges scorecards... except for one submission victory.  My predictions for the fights were right except for the Lidell/Jardine match... but I never thought I wouldnt see a knockout through the whole event.
116592,Corey,2007-09-23 11:02:00,355,Hey Gerr! Hope you didn't put money on your picks.... what's the inverse of a grand slam?
116625,Gerritt,2007-09-23 13:17:00,6129,No doubt!!  Shogun was OWNED!  Griffen does deserve to be in that ring with top rate talent  Jardine what an unorthodoxed  fighter....Liddell got beatup plain and simple  Sanchez should have been a sure bet... he got schooled   Made for an exciting night of MMA thats for sure... I bet a ton of people lost a ton of money!  G.
116652,Riparian,2007-09-23 15:27:00,269,I had confidence in Fitch all along... guy is a monster.
116674,Guest gbfisher,2007-09-23 17:00:00,0,All good fights.  LIDDELL was the winner!!..................bad decision...
116684,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-23 17:55:00,698,Damn saw this thread too late.  I actually picked Jardine over Liddell. Liddell is awful against strikers and he showed it again last night. Jardine dominated with leg kicks which slowed down Chukcs Mobility in the ocatagon. Good fight.  Forrest over Shogun. This was a shocker! I thought no way in hell could Forrest beat him but I was wrong. Shogun completely gassed and Forrest RNC'd him which looked rally bad on Shogun.  I still need to watch the rest of the fights as I was out last night and ended up taping it.
116702,danbo,2007-09-23 19:54:00,2646,I had a gut feeling about Jardine but still went with Chuck. Atta boy Forrest!! I like Sanchez but figured he was due for another lesson. Truly an exciting spectacle sport for us.
116762,mikeymikey,2007-09-23 23:11:00,376,I still enjoy the UFC from 1 ~ 10 or so the best.  Totally different styles fighting.  Love it.
