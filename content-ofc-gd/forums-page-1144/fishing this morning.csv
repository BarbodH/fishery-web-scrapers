After a while I cast to a different spot and got this one first cast.  The next cast I get another one.When I reeled this one in I noticed its underside.Not sure what is wrong with it but Ethan thought it was pretty sick.   After that nothing else was biting so we left. As for the reminder,I took the boys to the Credit River just to see what was going on.The water level is still pretty low but did see a few salmon trying to get upriver.This next pic reminded me of why I have decided to wait for a bit to try fishing a river.  This was just one side of the hole.All told there must have been 30-40 anglers working this one hole.There were tangle ups a lot and no fish being hooked.Saw maybe 3 fish splashing and jumping around the hole but that was it.I don't know if I am getting old or what but standing that close to so many other people is not working for me this year.Anyway,we walked the river a bit,lots of guys fishing,1 fish caught but at least the scenery was nice.   Was a long day and the boys slept all the way back but was nice to get out and enjoy the weather."
116751,Greencoachdog,2007-09-23 22:12:00,8163,Nice report and pics!!!  The next time you see a bunch of folks like that in a wad. Holler SNAKE!!! Right There!!!... He Just Went Under!!!... and watch them clear out.  Ya gotta love those fall colors eh!
116753,fatherof3,2007-09-23 22:16:00,1769,"lol,thats a good one.Will try that nice time and yes the trees were starting to get some nice colour on them"
116759,mikeymikey,2007-09-23 23:07:00,376,i would like to see one of them hook a salmon and makes a killer run and tangle up all the lines
116771,salmon,2007-09-23 23:32:00,334, Exactly the reason why I avoid the circus. Only when it is October\November is when you see me out there and have the river all to myself. Jose

116854,BGis,2007-09-24 03:36:00,15,"Man that bass looks like its hurting. I,ve been seeing a lot of similar stuff on Speed river fish. Wonder if its related the the link below.  Nice pics , looks like you had a good time.    http://dnr.wi.gov/fish/pages/vhsfacts.html#4"
