116757,huntervasili,2007-09-23 22:44:00,1604,"Okuma makes good rods... I havent used the Aventa but know that they are good quality, and have a decent warranty too... I have a bunch of okuma rods and am satisfied with every one of em."
116768,DMASSE,2007-09-23 23:22:00,420,"ALEX  Its a OK rod, but the 15:6 is a long rod, generally it would be better for rivers like the Saugeen, Niagra,  any larger body of water,  Plus being new to the sport it may be alittle hard to use.  If you like the OKUMA line, try the 13:6...  u will find it alot easier for smaller rivers like oshawa , bowmanville etc etc  Also for this dollor amount,  you might be better off with the RAVEN MATRIX... $84-$98  for the OKUMA and $109. for the matrix...     Dave"

116818,steverowbotham,2007-09-24 01:32:00,1800,"tribs is short for tributaries, the rivers that flow into the lake.  15'6 is way too long for the eastern tribs, definitely a Niagara/Saugeen kind of deal, big rivers.  13'6 or even an 11'6 will do for the easterns and your westerns like bronte and credit"
116819,danc,2007-09-24 01:35:00,4677, I catch all of my Steelhead on a 7 or 7 1/2 foot Cabelas Fish Eagle II rod. I wouldn't change it for the world.  I use a Cabelas spinning reel too. Awesome combo.
