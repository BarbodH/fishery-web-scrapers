116506,Muskieman,2007-09-23 00:19:00,2472,"you may go  the nearest auto parts shop and have a can of "" Mary Kay Pink"" Mixed into a spraybomb. ask to have the paint mixed into a Acrylic Enamel have them add a Flex Agent to the recipe. should run about 25$, split on a can and paint more than one rod. or you can choose other shades of pink in the ""chip book"". Buy a rod of yer choice and go nuts with the masking tape { Norton Fineline tape...1/8""] it's blue. Once dry add a good coat of carnuba wax."
