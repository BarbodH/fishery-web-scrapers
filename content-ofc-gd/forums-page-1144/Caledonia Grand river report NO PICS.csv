Was it worth it?????? My taste buds say YES! I was fishing with worms on a pickerel rig, actually pulled in two gobys at a time frequently, lost it and changed to a sinker base - 12"" high #6 hook and caught my bass on that. Oh, by the way the Gobys are on the shore, I found out that you do NOT throw them back........oops to all tight lines and keep her between the shorlines. Albert"

116499,huntervasili,2007-09-22 23:56:00,1604,"I thought by ""your taste buds say YES!"" meant you ate the gobies... lol"
116555,kennyman,2007-09-23 02:43:00,737,ICK!!! I can't imagine eating the gobies. The feel like rubber coming off a hook. Did you eat any???
116622,HTHM,2007-09-23 13:15:00,4082,No I did not eat the goby's. Although....................one was kinda big....
116626,ccmtcanada,2007-09-23 13:17:00,7971,"LOL...nice report and congrats on the bass.  Yeah...when I get bored, I'll put a small hook and worm on and catch gobies too....if I'm good at it...I can catch them, bring them out of the water and in one smooth motion, swing the line and hook around, smash it on the ground, and off comes dead goby....LOL.  Glad you had a good day!"
