116347,Sugarpacket,2007-09-22 04:31:00,82,"Last night we had a break in at the BBR Sugarpacket mansion and so BBR was just too frightened to work. So after calling the cops and changing the locks BBR needed some spry soothing and his sucky just wasn't cutting it. It was time for some heavy-duty soothing and off to the MIGHTY LYNN we went. After about two cast with his new float rod BBR hooked into a spry chub.  Following in his lead I caught the next most sought after species in the MIGHTY LYNN, the spry goby. Then I thought to myself I must unleash the renowned Sugarpacket tactics!! So I used #184 in the Sugarpacket Guide to Fishing (brought to you by the Sleded Book of Tips) and used the O' Naturel Strike Indicator. Its a rather spry trick where you cast over a spry tree branch and into the spry water, now be very careful not to snag the spry tree. here is a spry diagram    Then I caught my PB!!!! The spry Crayfish, and of course as I reeled it in I screamed once again, being the wuss I am and so BBR had to hold it for the picture.    After that we got into the real action I hooked myself a great looking spry sucker! Boy was I PUMPED!!!    Then I landed another one! I was winning of course but not for long as BBR switched from the float rod to his trusty ultra light and pulled in the biggest spry sucker we saw all night.      But I was still in the lead beating him by not only variety but amount as well until that is he battled with a most worthy contender. After what seemed to be an hour long fight he landed a very spry sculpin and we were tied.  Because of how rare the sculpin are BBR was acting like the fry Guardian, as the crayfish I had caught earlier tried to eat one of the spry fry swimming nearby and so then he was beating me (weep) then he caught another spry chub this thing was HUGE!    After that we (as in me) stopped keeping track of who caught what and we reeled in some more suckers. BBR being a faithful reader of the Sugarpacket Tactics also use tip #184 to his advantage and hooked into a scrappy white sucker (slap I mean spry white sucker) As the day drew on and faded into evening the suckers grew tired as did we.      BBR was getting cranky and needed to get some good old beauty sleep. So after the days  heavy-duty soothing he was ready to get back to his regular routine. 7:00pm hit and he knew it was time for bed so he curled up with his sucky (aka pooty) his blanky, happy guy and Bertha the musky rod and I read him some awe inspiring fishing tales as he drifted off to sleep with visions of fish swimming through his head.    THE END      Did I mention we were actually trying for trout???  SPRY!"

116349,Rich,2007-09-22 04:38:00,3927,"Me so sweepy...  That crayfish didn't quite rival the crustaceans on the east coast, but it'll do. Several vorms were harmed in the making of this report.  Welcome to the site honey! Now I have nowhere to complain about life at home"
116352,discophish,2007-09-22 05:14:00,392,"Wow!  One of the more creative reports I have read on this board.  Fantastic job.  You have illustrated that the sport of fishing is pure and fun.   Oddly and surprisingly enough, some people end up losing the purity of what the sport is all about.  I love youthful (in a great way) and Innocent policies and approaches, especially when you can apply it in a way you have displayed.  Thanks for the great read.  Loved it.  Make sure BBR doesn't get too attached to the yellow smiley character.  It looks like he depends on it in a rather shocking manner.  Keep an eye on him, soon he may start getting into the habit of working late hours at the office.  That's when you know there is something else.  Disco"
