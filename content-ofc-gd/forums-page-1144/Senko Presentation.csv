116569,wallyboss,2007-09-23 04:20:00,1095,Senkos are best worked very slowly especially if you rig them wacky style. Hooked right in the middle.  I always fish them too fast. Last time I was out for smallies and fishing senkos I wasbn't getting any hits. Then my buddy had problems with his eletric motor so I put my rod down and strated giving him a hand to try to fix it. Well by the time we finished looking at the electric I had been interrupted by 3 smallies. So cast it out and let sink and wait and then wait again .
116589,singingdog,2007-09-23 09:42:00,1047,"Yep, slow is the key with senkos. Let it fall, let it sit, lift it a little, let it fall, let it sit.....One presentation that gets overlooked with senkos/stick baits is jig-worming. On a light jighead, they have a faster spiral fall somewhere between a tube and a worm: great presentation when the fish are a bit deeper, or holding in weeds."

116636,Beans,2007-09-23 13:48:00,3339,Yep...no matter if you texas-rig or wacky-worm 'em...the best way is to cast out...set your rod down...and try to do sumpin' like eat a g'weech...or have a drink...etc.  They are a do-nothing lure from my experiences...  Hmmm...a senko/wizzle worm under a float...I wonder...might be worth a try...I know it works with tubes...

116695,SlowPoke,2007-09-23 19:37:00,2984,I bought some last year at Lambeth and Steve told me the toughest part about fishing senko's was leaving it alone. I don't bass fish as often as I would like but I hope to put them to use more often this fall. -Brian
116712,Guest skeeter99,2007-09-23 20:10:00,0,hey slowpoke  you dont use senko's for pike and muskie fishing? they work great for pike and have caught lots of muskie on them!!!!  6 inch  sweet potato pie colour will get them everytime   even the odd walleye  LOL!!  I prefer tiki and bamboo sticks from wave worms they fall slower than senko
116716,SlowPoke,2007-09-23 20:19:00,2984,"I can count on one hand how many times I've been out casting this year so it's not that I don't use them, I just don't get out enough to use them! -Brian"
