116363,ntgrk,2007-09-22 10:37:00,16,Hi guys  I think its time to add a second rod I currently have a ugly stick lite with a abu garcia 103 reel I was currently looking at the bps flyer and they have the bionic blade for 69 bucks and  a browning citori spinning reel for 80 bucks I have only been fishing for a couple of years . I am trying to avoid duplication with the rod so i am looking for medium to heavy action . ...how is this real compare to a quantum or shimano in the same price range?   thanks in advace

I like Quantum's higher level reels. Abu Garcia makes a decent reel in the $50-80 range, but I forget what its called (even though I have one on my ultra light). Personally, I'd go to your local fishing shop and see what they have in stock. I've never been too impressed with BPS rod/reel combos. For the money you are willing to spend you could get a better combo than what you are looking at. IMO"

116482,taper,2007-09-22 22:48:00,611,I have bought a few Quantum set ups lately and in my opinion you can't go wrong with them.
