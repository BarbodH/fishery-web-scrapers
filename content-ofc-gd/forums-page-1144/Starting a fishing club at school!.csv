116045,ilario,2007-09-21 02:25:00,166,"So I've decided to start up a fishing club at the high school I teach at in York Region... Not sure how I should go about this.. Anyone know of similar programs for teens? The school's in Thornhill (407 & Lesie) so it's not to far from a few good watersheds (rogue, Don) and some fishing ponds in Markham..  Hope to hear some suggestions!  thanks!  PP"

116209,Nemo,2007-09-21 17:17:00,727,"See OFSAA they are promoting new clubs for school and will pony up $800 to introduce the sport/activity.  ""Funding will be provided to a limited number of schools to introduce secondary school students to a new sport or physical activity through a one-day activity, intramural event, or clinic. The focus must be on sports and/or physical activities that have not been available to students in the past. Funds can be used to purchase equipment, instructors, travel, facility rental, transportation and/or other resource materials. ""  http://www.ofsaa.on.ca/site/index.cfm  Go for it Poacher I would be interested in what happens."

116249,wuchikubo,2007-09-21 19:59:00,1114,"Hey isn't that St. Roberts?  Anyways,  in Markham Toogood pond and Milne Park both have some angling opportunities.  Don't bother with Waldon pond, the daily poachers have pretty much gutted the place (reminds me I need to bring a camera next time I go for a walk there, one guy had 5 lines in the water!).  Another popular spot for river anglers is near 9th line and Steeles (not recommend for too large of a group of kids).  Not sure if that helps.  Stan"
