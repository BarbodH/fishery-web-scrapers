Arrived at 5:30am and there was maybe a little under a dozen people there. One of the guys caught a salmon earlier as it was on display . Fish was jumping every so often so I was pretty excited to give it a go. First time doing this so I was using my 7' rapala medium action rod and tossing spoons (not glow in the dark). Didn't have a single bite or anyone else who was there. So at 10 we decided to call it quit and decided to head upriver. We spotted a few dead salmons and one live one that we tried to entice with our lure. Still a fun trip overall going to do it again sometime soon."
116692,SlowPoke,2007-09-23 19:24:00,2984,Too bad you couldn't get anything but at least you got out. I'm not sure where you were up the river but keep in mind there is (or at least was) a sancutuary from the Lakeshore Bridge north somwhat. -Brian

I'm no expert (having just caught my first a week ago) but there definitely seems to be some more action the later you stay out.  You also have fewer folks with rods in the water the later it gets so there's a bit better chance that your spoon will be the one that gets the bite."
