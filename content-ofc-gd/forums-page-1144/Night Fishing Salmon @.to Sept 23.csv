116595,hairywater,2007-09-23 11:35:00,15,"Hi: I'm new to the forum, and a newbie Salmon addict. I caught my first salmon in my kayak out at Port Credit late in August, since then I have done little else but eat sleep and breath salmon. Tonite the stage was set for a major all night fishing extravaganza, my wife and kids are out of town today and I'v stayed in town because of salmon....no I mean work. Now I don't have a car, that's cool there are many great fishing spots you can get to by bike in 1/2 an hour from downtown.  I'm off early, like 8:30 pm, I'v got my tackle together, a sardine wrap on my kwickfish,good to go. Hop on my bike.       !*#$@ing flat tire. No problem, off to the gas station, flat repair kit (there is a god), I'm on the road again in 30 minutes. Were to go. I have found the bite kind of slow lately, so I decide to explore the Leslie St. Spit, thinking that maybe the salmon will like the structure and cool water out at the end of the point. Now there is one thing about night fishing in Toronto most people are unaware of. All the good fishing spots are out of the way locations, dark, and shared equally between the fisherfolk, axe murders, and serial killers. Well after a 1/2 hour on the spit, I'm listening for splashes, biking listening.... All the while getting more and more creeped out by the glimpses reflective fabric in bushes hi-lighted by my headlamp as I ride along. ( axe murder wannabes take note, cover reflective bits of your kit) I finally get to my destination, the point. I dismount and start walking. Now out of rubble and shrubs I see the silhouette of a man with a beard. No a giant with a beard that goes down to his chest. Thats it,  I'm so out of there. I turn my bike around, hop on and..... #@!$%^^%ing flat tire again.. Merde. No time to worry about my rim, my tire or anything else. I'm going as fast as I can with one wheel, wondering all the while, if all those bad things my wife says  that can happen to me fishing, included ritual dismemberment. I make it off the spit in one piece, and think about flat. Me=idiot, I left the flat repair kit at work, well there is no gas stations in this godforsaken end of Toronto anyway. Well there is only one thing to do. Fish. I ""ride"", (grind) to my least favorite place to fish, I have been skunked there every time out. Needless to say it is dark and creepy there to.  I breakout the rod and kwickfish, cast.....retrieve....nothing  cast....retrieve.... nada   cast...retrieve....(insert the music from the movie ""Deliverance""), I change lures. My baby, a 2/3oz glow blue/white cleo with a razor sharp #4 siwash hook, it casts like a bullet, and can cut the 4th dimension with practice. Cast....retrieve....zip. Cast.....bail snaps shut....cleo is now in synchronic orbit with Titan. Get out #2 favorite. 3/4 glow green/white, cleo with siwash. Cast......snag.....snap. I consider surrendering to big dude with beard on the spit. Check tackle. Hmm, Mepps glow spinner. I've never like it but what the heck. Cast...wap..... zeeeeeeeee. Fish on baby, things are looking up. Huge runs, it feels like a seal. 15 minues later I land it, 19# chinnie. Cool, off it goes. Cast..etc. Change lures. Glow mepps little wolf. Cast, start to fool around with my retrieve, very erratic. Short jerks, long pauses....wap......zeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. Fish on baby... (see above) 18# chinne. Repeat 20# chinnie, Hook another big one, big zeeeeeeeeeeeeeee....snap. (Note to self, change leader after every other fish). Change lures, Blue little wolf. Cast....wap...zeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, really big run, many big jumps...probaly a coho. It turns on me, I'm winding like a banshee...dead stop? Snag?  No way? Yes way! Spit the hook and snaged me. Clear hook. Cast....wap...zeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee,17#chinnie Cast...wap...zeeeeeeeeeee 21#chinneeee. Final tally 5 for 7. All monster fighters, best fishing day in my life. Wrist is swollen (bad break 2 months ago) No damn camera duh!  4:00am Still have flat, long, long, long walk home. Couldn't care less.   Hairywater"

116614,smokinall4s,2007-09-23 12:49:00,89,"Great report. Glad to see that axe murders don't like to fish or atleast not at night, too busy I guess. Anyways, when you go to pick up a tire repair kit look at some cameras. Some pics would have been great."
116615,ccmtcanada,2007-09-23 13:04:00,7971,"LOL....what a great report....very funny read!  I pound the shore mostly for salmon as well...and you described to a T what shore fishing is all about.  My wife and I have said ""You know those reports you hear on the news....Dead body found by local hiker/fisherman?  That'll be us one day""....LOL.  Welcome to the board...looking forward to more reports from you now that the salmon...I mean work keeps you in town..."
116616,MartyP,2007-09-23 13:05:00,8,nice report. Good fishing!
116620,Bly,2007-09-23 13:11:00,1556,"Great read!!   Ahhh the fun and fear of finding new night fishing locations around the GTA, always a small wonder if you are going to end up on the news as victim or witness!  Congrats on the great night!!  Tackle losses and all seem worth it when you have a night like that!  Look forward to more of your reports."
