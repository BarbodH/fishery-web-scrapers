Woke up bright and early and made the treck up to meet him at his place.  We were either going to hit Sturgeon or Pigeon but we knew it was going to be windy.  Sturgeon was already built up pretty bad so it was a no go so we thought we'd give Pigeon a try.  It too was pretty rough but we gave it a go.  It was tough to fish and we only managed some small walleye and bass.  But this being one of my few times walleye fishing I was able to learn some good techniques.  We called it a day early and headed back to his place.  I'd like to thank fishindevil and fishergirl for being so warm and welcoming me into their house for coffee and some WFN action!  It was great, and we got some good fish talk in!  I think we spent about 3 hours just chatting.  Thanks again fishindevil, can't wait to hook up again!  Evan  p.s.  If you couldn't tell, I love your boat"
