I also think it might be called Starburst. The back is dark navy blue with bright flex or spec and has an orange belly. I tried looking a bass pro, no luck. Does anyone know if they are discontinue?"

116486,nelly,2007-09-22 22:54:00,256,"Thanks for the link but I still couldn't find the colour that I was looking for. I did manage to find my old 2006 BPS catalog. Page 255-Colour #23,26 Looking for it in the suspending. It's a killer for bass on couch and simcoe. Nice looking lure with alot of bright flex and shine on the back."

116511,gone_fishin,2007-09-23 00:31:00,481,"check that link again, and instead of clicking on the suspending models, click on the ""rattlin' rogues"" link, i think the colour you are looking for is the very first model. by the way, the rattlin' rogues also suspend."
