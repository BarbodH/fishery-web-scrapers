The glow powder comes in many colors and need to be mix in other oil base spirit and then applied on objects. I just bid, won, and will be receiving it soon, but have not tried it in the past. I will post it here after I have played with it.  Has anyone use this product before and does the glow really last longer?  I have been tweaking my spoon and other lures using glow tape or glow paint from dollar stores or Michael's craft store, the glow paint hardly last, and the glow tape is decent, but Little cleo lure produces longer glow.   For those who are concern of losing expensive lures, this product is worth investigating."
