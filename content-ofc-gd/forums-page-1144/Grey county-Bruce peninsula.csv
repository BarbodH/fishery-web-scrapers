116104,ranger520vx,2007-09-21 12:52:00,164,The ones you mentioned are all good. Chesley probably best best. Tell us how you make out.
116105,misfish,2007-09-21 12:55:00,29133,I remember Chesley. HUGE SUN FISH.
116133,duckdog,2007-09-21 13:53:00,162,"Thank you ccmtcanada, misfish and ranger520vx care to share your experiences there? Would be great to here, I have fished a few inland lakes up here Mountain, Aaran, McCullough and Bells all with only good bass results but I am a pike fan and just starting to get hooked on walley I also had great luck with jumbo perch a few weeks ago at Aaron lake conservation, Bell's lake I had no real luck but its just an amzing looking lake, Mountain lake is hard to get at a guy I met let me use the tax payers launch so to speak and there are monster smallies in there caught a few between 4 and 5lbs and one tiny pike that seemed to follow me all day but would not hit anything lol, by the way I live in Owen Sound thats why I am looking for some hints, I lives most of my life in the Port Severn area and had no problem with getting a load of pike :-)  Nelson"
116152,ranger520vx,2007-09-21 14:44:00,164,Check your PM for my special advice to you Nelson.  These lakes are clear so artificial lures should be good replicas of the real thing. You can't beat an black yellow bucktail jig along cabbage weedbeds or a Rapala Shad Rap in Perch colour.  Fluorcarbon line is worth the $$ in these situations.  I always start FAST with horizontal lures like jerkbaits and crankbaits on rocky / sandy areas and only slow down if I'm not hooking up.
