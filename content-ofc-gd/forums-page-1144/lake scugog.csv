116303,POLLIWOGG,2007-09-21 23:42:00,835,"Actually the live well people were already labeled by our Mohawk neighbors as ""those who play with their  food"" Sort of depends on where you come from."
116304,Terry,2007-09-21 23:43:00,14456,"I hope you got my point  that one persons values (big picture) will always be different from the next persons values  ..most people who believe in  P3TA, really believe that they see the big picture and that we are dead wrong fishing.it is cure it is in humane. it is wrong.... and they will tell you to see the big picture..their values..their big picture...  so I believe that we must leave our values in our pocket when talking about this stuff and deal with the law.....and that we can use against people ....  we can try to educate... and it would be great if we could get more people to follow our values about fishing  but pushing  you own values onto others is just like pushing your religion onto others..."
116313,duckdog,2007-09-22 00:18:00,162," I thank you for sharing your values, it seems that you got a bit mad at me for not sharing your values though, see what I meen. We both have our thoughts and both are right in our minds I beleive in everything you are saying except speaking my values :-)"
116314,Terry,2007-09-22 00:33:00,14456,... well it was you telling me that you found what I said offencive... why. for not sharing your values ..lets not twist things .....it was I that said lets respect peoples values   people read anything they want into posts
116320,duckdog,2007-09-22 01:12:00,162,"Correct I did say it was offensive, I did not say you were wrong or you should not state what you think, I simply said I found it offensive and I found it offensive because  ""it is not the fishermans job to look a the bigger picture it is their job to read the rules and follow them""  So that quote seems to indicate we should all be followers and not try to contribute to better fishing, you can quote me on that  Nothing has been twisted maybe I did push the comment on ""the bigger picture, I agree""  and its not a values that I am trying to push here its common sense, we have to look at the big picture if you want to keep fishing in the future, tell me you want to see all the bait fish and smaller guys kept so you and your kids can not fish in the future, please tell me that and I see no further argument on my side"
116323,Terry,2007-09-22 01:35:00,14456,"well I am glad that you will not respond any more to this thread  and you read into my statement what you wanted it to mean then tell me it's Offensive  that guy fishing from shore , which this topic is about.....who know ..it may be the first time he has ever fished or maybe he lost his job and is trying to get enough fish for a meal..who knows.. but it is not every persons 'job' to worry about  every detail of the fisheries the very second he picks up a rod for the first time any more then it's you job to do every thing possible to protect the planet, so you son has a planet to live on and by your answers you don't worry or think  about the big picture of the world very much, ......but I offend you because I state, it's not every fishermans job to see the big picture about fishing..now that is offensive..that's twisted"

116291,duckdog,2007-09-21 22:25:00,162,"  Speaking of offensive I myself find this post very offensive, it is for sure the job of the fisherman to look at the bigger picture and tell me you dont throw fish back in because you want to catch more later, well then you just looked at the bigger picture  Firm beleiver in yes follow the rules and helpenforce them, there is alot more anglers out there then there is law  As for grouping people I will not get into that, I dont see the point of keeping everything you catch, that's all I have to say on that subject"
116297,Terry,2007-09-21 23:04:00,14456,"as do I about you   so, you look at the big picture in everything in life or just fishing  so I take it you don't fish because fishing for sport is cure and unnecessary  you will not have children, because the world is getting over populated  you don't drive a car because if you look at the big picture you would be killing the world using oil products  you clearly only use solar power and wind power because everything else is killing the planet  or is it just fishing where you have great insight and can clearly see the big picture and all else in the world should think the way you do........give me a break  people that think everyone else should have the same valves as them sure are full of themselves  if they are within the law leave them the hell alone...they even made a law to protect their right to fish"
