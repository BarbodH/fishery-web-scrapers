87726,DonC,2007-06-26 00:16:00,36,"Addy, My oldest brother will be at Casa Blanca this Friday with 3 of his boyhood buddies and fish Saturday to Monday.  They are in their eary 60's and doing the American Plan.  If you want to catch walleye, try in Sand Bay around the island at the east entrance in the weed beds.  I fish artificial and use jig spinners with #3 size blades in silver or brass, with a 1/8 ounce jighead attached, and have a 2 or 3 inch curly tail grub, preferably a Berkley Power Grub.  I troll or cast them.  Pike are everywhere in the weeds.  Use a bass spinnerbait in bright colors on the skirt.  Smallmouth in current and chunk rock shorelines, casting tubes, curly tail 3 inch grubs, and bass spinnerbaits.  Ask Bryan for spots.  Good luck and say hi to my brother John if you are there this coming weekend, Don"

88028,Pochucker,2007-06-26 17:09:00,16,"Great place. Was there three yrs ago . Food was great. Brian and liz fantastic hosts. Brian more than willing to give you tour of area point out some spots and some areas to avoid. If you like bass have him take you to portage lake -- never caught 2-4lb smallies/largemouths in middle of day when it was 90degrees before.  Only reason I havent been back is the ""boat in ""thing . My wife likes to ""go to town"" on occaision and she felt little trapped."
88065,Slimeball,2007-06-26 18:54:00,30,"Spent about 7 seasons there. Very good camp and well run, Liz is not there anymore. The lodge is up for sale also."
88085,DonC,2007-06-26 19:39:00,36,"Slimeball, Do you know the particulars of what the price is and where it is listed, etc. Thanks, DonC"
88101,OhioFisherman,2007-06-26 20:01:00,6623,"Never been to that lodge but visited the Lunge Lodge I think in the same area, my buddies still go there every year. Healthy population of L/M and S/M in the main area, they have a camp bass tournie every year and it takes a 4 pound plus fish for big bass, possible with either."
88212,Daplumma,2007-06-27 00:15:00,1961,I had heard Liz had left but didn't know the place was for sale.It would be a handful to run alone. Joe
