90560,silvio,2007-07-04 03:12:00,433,This past weekend at my cottage we found lots of beer bottles and beer cans in the empty lot beside us. But I was wondering do the cans have to be round shape or can they be dented a bit wasn't to sure also how much is the return on them thanks guys.
90573,Fisherman,2007-07-04 03:43:00,7201,"Last time I asked, they didn't want them crushed, something to do with the recycling process to remove the paint."
90582,John Bacon,2007-07-04 05:19:00,3277,I always step on mine to flatten them into a disk about an inch thick; they have never refused them.  I doubt that they will complain about a few dents.

90596,Riparian,2007-07-04 08:30:00,269,"Im not sure if aluminum cans get washed and re-used like beer bottles do. I think they get crushed and melted down. Paint and other contaminants get pulled off in the ""slag"" that forms at the top of the melted metal."
90597,Shelley Cooper,2007-07-04 08:38:00,394,I too always crush mine and have had no problems with returns...
90622,pikehunter,2007-07-04 11:02:00,1659,"I have returned many crushed cans without refusal. They are not reused! They are sold as scrap. The deposit you pay when purchasing the cans in the first place are just that, a deposit to ensure they are returned.  Now if they would enact a law to have a mandatory deposit on those dreaded Tim Horton cups they would be doing something worthwhile!"
90625,huey graphite,2007-07-04 11:18:00,362,   Yeah no kidding. I too am sick of seeing them blowing around our roads and floating on our waterways. I recently discovered they as well as all paper cups can go into our green bins.
90629,pigeonfisher,2007-07-04 11:28:00,696,We used to return cans by the garbage bag full after large getherings.  100 cans per bag (crushed).
90630,Roy,2007-07-04 11:31:00,13728,I too bring them back to the store  100 at a time but I leave them intact cause they're easier to put into the crushing machine there.  I never crush the glass ones though.
90637,pikehunter,2007-07-04 11:55:00,1659, :D
90678,John,2007-07-04 14:39:00,2956, Light weekend Roy?
90789,Joey,2007-07-04 19:29:00,9122," I was wondering about that Huey, that's good to know.  Thanks  Joey"
