We never looked back and fish after fish was the days events. We boated 65 Crappies (kept 12) a Smallmouth, a Largemouth and a perch. What an awesome day. Gotta luv the Binbrook. 8-)   "

90276,jediangler,2007-07-03 12:34:00,1923,Way to go Joonmoon & Goog. Glad to see your cast isn't holding you back from catching fish. You have to love the conservation areas for fishing.
90277,Stoty,2007-07-03 12:35:00,2910,Thanks for the map.  Just wish that spot was a little closer to Pickering!
90298,ccmtcanada,2007-07-03 13:31:00,7971,Great report!  Gotta love it when the action is non stop like that!!
90677,jediangler,2007-07-04 14:29:00,1923,So when are you going to invite me over to help you eat em?
90815,joonmoon,2007-07-04 21:12:00,528,"I'm not sure we need any help to eat em...lol. We only kept a doz, prolly should have released em all but some were so hungry the Lucy Jig was stuck in their eyes or ripped their mouth so bad. The size was lesser than we have caught at Island lake but talk about action. The fishfinder had fish showing up constantly. Great place to throw in the yak. It's a similar size to Island lake, not as wide and much deeper and longer with lots of little bays to cruise in and out of...if I were a fish."
90831,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-07-04 22:24:00,0,Sounds like fun. That first shot would have been nicer if you could see the eyes from both fish. Funny none the less.
90907,joonmoon,2007-07-05 01:48:00,528,"I know, but I could only use one hand the other hand has a cast on it. Broke my thumb a few weeks back. Didn't want the smell of fish all over the cast, gotta wear it yet for another week."
