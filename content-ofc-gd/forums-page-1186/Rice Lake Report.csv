I don't really know the lake to well so most of the fish we caught were around docks just flipping tubes or finesse worms on a 14 ft aluminum without the help of a trolling motor.  Caught a nice lunker largie flipping a white tube under a small dock which gave me a run for my money with actually wrapping the line around the docks support bars lol after a nice fight finally managed to get him out thank god for Power Pro.  What a beauty it was weighed 4.3 lbs on the lip grip, took a photo and released gave me a nice splash and off it went.  I will post that photo later because my cousin has it. We also caught a tone of crappie and bluegill.  I am not a big fan of eating largmouth just because I like to fish them for sport not for eating but we kept a couple for the pan and fried them up and surprisingly they have a great taste to them.  But here are a few pics from the trip.    My cousin with his actual first bucket mouth in 7 years.    Fish ready to be cleaned and fried mmm."
