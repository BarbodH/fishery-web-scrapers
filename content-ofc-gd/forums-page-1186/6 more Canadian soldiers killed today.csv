90873,Smokey,2007-07-05 00:41:00,1278,Another tough loss for all Canadians. Most of them so close to the end of there tour at the end of the month. It's a new kind of war and tough one to win or control.  My Condolances go out to all the families.
90912,Joey,2007-07-05 01:59:00,9122,Very unfortunate indeed.  Maybe they should stay off the beaten path.  I feel for the families tonight and wonder when this is going to stop.  Joey
