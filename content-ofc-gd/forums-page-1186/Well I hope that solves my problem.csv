Well this afternoon I take the blade off and there was enough line wrapped around the shaft to fill a reel.Holly crap. So I hope by removing all the line,it will solve the problem,if not,it,s a new motor for me next week.Anyone know of any good deals out there?   Right now I have the motorguide gator."

90802,lew,2007-07-04 20:02:00,12767,Hopefully that'll solve your problems Brian.  I remove the props from both my troll motor and main motor about once a month to ckeck for any line wrapped around the shafts. Only takes a few minutes but can save HUGE $$$$
