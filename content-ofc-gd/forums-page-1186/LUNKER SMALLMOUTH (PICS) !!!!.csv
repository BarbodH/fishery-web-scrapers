90666,fishindevil,2007-07-04 14:04:00,6254,"Nice smallies for sure!!!!!!!! cheers,well done"
90699,douG,2007-07-04 16:08:00,2693,"OK, I can't hold out any longer with the real answer.  The fish obviously weighs 1.4 times the weight of the bottle.  1.4 liters x 2.2 lbs / liter = 3.08 lbs."
90705,Roy,2007-07-04 16:24:00,13728,Your answer would be much more credible (it would hold more water) had you spelled 'litre' correctly.
90708,fliptheslop,2007-07-04 16:33:00,112,"Acually it can be spelt both ways in the english language, so we will let this go this time seeing your from Que. lol"
90373,jdmls,2007-07-03 16:46:00,575,"Picked it up jigging a shoal in about 15 FOW. Got half a dozen more, this being the biggest. All in the 12-16 inch range. What a honey hole!!!...This is the third time getting out to it and still have never seen a boat within atleast half a KM. What do you guys think it weighed ??       This is a 1 LITRE bottle !!! "
90378,bbog,2007-07-03 16:54:00,665,'bout 3lbs?
90381,addy79,2007-07-03 16:56:00,573,"i know that bottle, thats a BIG smallie. I would guesstimate its weight at around 5lbs!"
90382,ccmtcanada,2007-07-03 16:56:00,7971,"I agree with Barnie...I had an 18"" smallie that looked similar in girth that came in just over 2.5 pounds."
90388,Dutch,2007-07-03 17:09:00,831," Sorry, but not even close - 2.5 to 3 max.  I would like you as a fishing partner though....lol."
90393,Stoty,2007-07-03 17:15:00,2910,"Ya, looks to be around 3ish. Nice fish though!"
90402,Weeds,2007-07-03 17:28:00,782,"This is a 1 LITRE bottle !!!   That's a 1.5 litre bottle, no?"
90403,ketchenany,2007-07-03 17:29:00,3229,Is that dad's old Pricecraft? Now that was a heavy? Swing by the house and get a scale   Nice catch . . .
90405,davis,2007-07-03 17:31:00,128,Good 'ol San Benedetto!! LOL.  Nice fish. I agree - prob pushing around 3lbs+
90410,love2fishhave2work,2007-07-03 17:54:00,212,Had to brag.  Here is my lunker from this weekend. 
90412,Golfisher,2007-07-03 17:58:00,586,"Not sure about the weight, but it sure is bigger than the smallies that I've caught so far!"
90413,mattyk,2007-07-03 17:58:00,2110,nice fish.
90414,jediangler,2007-07-03 17:58:00,1923,"I weighed a 19"" smallie last year with about the same girth and it weighed 3.3lbs. Nice fish by any standards."
90415,charlesn,2007-07-03 17:59:00,551,"It's pretty fat, I'd say an honest 3 lber.  Nice fish.  Charles"
90430,snagmaster,2007-07-03 18:54:00,250,i dont know guys ....got a 4.3 lber last week and it was just under 20 and very fat.....that fish looks close to 4
90439,bassman,2007-07-03 19:23:00,384,4 - 4.5lbs definately
90444,Hookset,2007-07-03 19:41:00,367,3 - 3.3 definitely LOL maybe high at that. nice fish though.
90447,Roy,2007-07-03 20:09:00,13728,Well I'm glad we got that cleared up.
90448,Stoty,2007-07-03 20:13:00,2910,"hahahaha  I would say that it weighs over a pound, but less than 10.  "
90450,ketchenany,2007-07-03 20:16:00,3229,How much more did you weigh AFTER dinner?
90458,Rich,2007-07-03 20:35:00,3927,Beauty fish no matter what the weight. Congrats.
90470,steverowbotham,2007-07-03 21:01:00,1800,"19 inches, definitely 3, likely under 3.5 ."
90471,Rizzo,2007-07-03 21:03:00,4754,"WOW!!!! That's a real nice bottle.  I'm not looking for GPS points or anything but just some tips.  Did you get it at a grocery store? Variety Store?  Did you pay cash, debit, or credit?  Is it recyclable?  Could I get one like that within 2 hours of the GTA?  Thanks in advance for any details you can provide."
90538,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-04 01:42:00,2585,i caught a 20 inch on nipissing a couple weeks ago and it weighed 3lbs  nice fish anyway
90540,danc,2007-07-04 01:48:00,4677,I'd say it weighs about a litre. Maybe a litre and a half.
