As a few know, my wife & I are expecting our first child in October (its a boy!  ) so ive been busy chipping away at the never ending ""list"". Sorry i couldnt make Lakair this year, ive enjoyed the reports from it & almost felt like i was there. Thought I'd give ya peek of some of my on-the-water adventures from the past few months.  Spring was ok... a few lakers & browns to start things off         my best brown of this year - I was solo witha dispoable camera, so excuse the bad photo - this fish was only 25"" long, but its girth was 20"" it spat out lots of bait too when brought in the boat - PIG   finally the salmon turned on - was able to get a buddy his 1st one ever (excuse the blood, those who fish salmon know its common)    and dad got his 1st in many years   couple of my best thus far    there's been some acrobatic rainbows thrown in too - lotsa fun on the lighter gear   I took a short hiatus from the big water & went up to our place in the Kawarthas for muskie opener, only one small one, but was pleasently suprised with the good walleye action   but I rbought the boat back home with me and I am not sure when i'll be back up there......  been on Erie a coupla times recently & managed some eyes too  this past weekend was special, through the power of the internet, I was able to re-connect with an old highschool fishing buddy & we got out for the 1st time in about 7 yrs & grabbed a couple   the big Summer Salmon hunt begins this weekend & i'll be giving the east end of the lake a try  have a safe summer everyone,  "

90762,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-07-04 18:01:00,0,Man I gotta get a bigger boat! We have some really good salmanoid fishing near by! And that brown needs to go on a diet!!

90813,fishdawg,2007-07-04 21:09:00,912,"Johnny, my boat is only a 16.5 30hp tiller  - yours is nearly the same? Ive been fishing the Great lakes since I was 7, just gotta respect the water & know what days to stay home & wok on the honey-do-list  - no need for downriggers either, yes they are effective, but securely install some good rod holders & good salmon action can be had with other techniques"
90829,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-07-04 22:20:00,0," Yes I have a 16.5, 40 h.p. console. I hear alot of guys goin with smaller boats than mine. Still... I dont trust, Lake O, Erie, or Niagra river! I hear it can get ugly reel fast and I tried to battle 6 foot waves once, near Bowmanville....  I take it you are talking weighted lines and/or dipsey divers?Maybe some day I will try, but not any time soon."
