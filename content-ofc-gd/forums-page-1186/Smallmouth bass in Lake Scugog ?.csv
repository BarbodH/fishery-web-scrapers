90563,lookinforwalleye,2007-07-04 03:29:00,4399,"Yes there is I don`t target the smallies on Scugog but they are there.I have got a couple by accident,there was a charity tournament at Goreski`s last week and there were some nice ones weighed in."
90565,jediangler,2007-07-04 03:31:00,1923,"Yes there are smallies in Scugog, big ones too. This was caught from the ramp in Cesarea in September 2005 by the Shipper on a white spinnerbait. I believe it was 18.5"". "
90581,Guest skeeter99,2007-07-04 04:32:00,0,"yep there are lots of them!!  kind of a untapped fishery  there are areas of the lake (close to ceasarea) 8 to 12 feet were it is sand with black mud patches the smallies tend to like that in the bog, on hot sunny days you can see them come in and out of the darker water in the 6 foot of water crusing the sand (on a calm day) best was a 5.1 (digital scale) caught on a tube deadsticking it !!! actually it is almost like live bait fishing throw it out and leave it"
90623,Zamboni,2007-07-04 11:03:00,235,On weekdays right across from Cesarea launch-natural sandbar where people anchor to swim on weekends. Still may be some boats/kids over there on weekdays swimming on hot days but early/when its quiet smallmouth are on the gravel areas mixed in with sand....good shoreline to fish even though little structure.

90720,ty1on,2007-07-04 16:50:00,12,"There seems to be more and more every year, or at least I am catching more every year.  We have been catching them in weedy areas fishing for largemouth, so they seem to have adapted to all areas of the lake."
90741,Rizzo,2007-07-04 17:25:00,4754,"I only fished there once with a fellow some might know as ""Lurch"" (RIP), and we caught a number of smallies just trolling the chanel"
90753,mart,2007-07-04 17:46:00,93,A couple years ago I fished a tourney and the winning team had around 19lbs(5 fish) all Smallies. They are in there for sure.
