90936,Deg,2007-07-05 05:20:00,51,Finally got my computer problem solved and I end up fishing and not uploading pics .... isn't life tough. LOL  I'll keep the comments short as most others have said what a great week it was and have thanked everyone who made it possible.  We left Monday morning and everything was going great until we turned off Hwy 69.  We blew the transmission hose and came to a quick stop.  I called the lodge to let them know we would be late and after only a minute or two we lost the conection and couldn't get it back.  An hour later this friendly guy with a big smile pulls up beside me and wants to give us a hand.  It was a familiar face ... Chris aka muskiestudd who had driven all the way out from the lodge to tow our boat in.  Thank you Chris and Kevin for being so considerate.  It was great just seeing we had company back to the lodge.  From that point on everything improved.  We were greeted by that familiar sound  ... the jetboat.  And the other southern boy.  Fished that evening with GCD and his night vision eyes  Met Rich for the first time and spent a few days on the water together  Our evening fishing trips always had this crew near by to chat with when Graham wasn't telling the rockbass off  During the day we kept an eye out for the yacht ... the only thing missing on her is arm extentions for us short guys to reach the water  This is a shot of the USS Minnow .... if you squint you can see Gilligan  And of course the muskie hunters were out in force

Even my wife has enjoyed reading the posts from everyone and viewing all the pics.  I think she just wants to know what all I did up there.   Next year ... she'll find out for herself.
