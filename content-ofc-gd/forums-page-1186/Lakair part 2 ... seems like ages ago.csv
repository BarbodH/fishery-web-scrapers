Yes Maureen your shot turned out.  The hungry vultures await the offering.  Great idea Kevin.  A little diversion from fishing was a trip to the walleye pond with Kevin, Chuck and Graham.  Digger loves to spend time in the campground.   Here she is on guard for those tasty offerings.  Leslie is wondering how Digger is gaining weight when she is on a special dog diet.  Hmmm?? "
