90744,Raf,2007-07-04 17:34:00,3495,downeast salty s-10.  they will outlast your boat.
90745,jediangler,2007-07-04 17:34:00,1923,There are some called salty 2 from Downeaster. Musky guys trust them for their expensive gear so they gotta be good.
90747,Roy,2007-07-04 17:41:00,13728,"Yes, S-10's are probably the best there is but be careful. They are clamp-ons but depending on the type of boat you have, you may need make or buy mounts for them. The clamps only open about 3 inches or so."
