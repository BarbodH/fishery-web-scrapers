90118,ehg,2007-07-02 23:16:00,2666,"Sat. june 30  Hooked up with Mike (mikeh) from this board and headed up to north Pigeon lake via Bobcaygeon. I was taken aback by his 18ft. Skeeter w/ a V-max initially but hey we were gonna fly. On the drive up we saw some deer right by the south shoulder of the 401 around Whitby, that was a little odd. Once on the lake it took about 30 seconds to cross the lake to try the east shoreline up towards the Bald lakes. Fishing was slow to start. The winds were light and shifting around. Started clouding over and the fish started hitting a little better, as it started to rain. Ended up catching 6 or 7 small largemouth before we thought of moving and trolling big spinnerbaits for musky. As soon as the troll started i looked over my shoulder and noticed a nasty wall cloud quickly heading our way. We got off the water just in time as this storm pounded the lake behind us. Caught some fish so didn't get skunked. Sorry but didn't take pictures. Mike was a great guy with a cool boat. Thanks!  Of note though, we did see some dead carp floating around up there as well.  Sun. july 1  Couldn't travel far so tried a little GTA brookie fishing early Sunday morning. This spot is very close to Toronto but was so overgrown with brush and weeds it made for a tough trek.  They creek was fairly unfishable but i had waders and skipped my Panther Martin under brush.   My first fish of the day was puny but i was happy  Ended up catching a dozen or so of these little guys and some bigger up to 12 inches.    So that was a fun but exhausting couple of hours right near Toronto.  Mon. july 2  Took my 4 yr. old daughter up to the Otonabee R. for a little panfishing. Not much to explain here just the microtube w/ worm bit under a float.  Had to buy worms on the way up never bought these before. Caught all the regular panfish. A pretty pumpkinseed.  Some others  Lots of boat activity on this river.   Some dude pulled up on a little 8 ft. dinghy and kept this 20 inch smallmouth which he wanted my daughter to pose with to make it look bigger.   So i had a busy fish filled weekend (nothing huge) right near Toronto. Gotta love taking a kid fishing.  Cheers,  ehg"

90157,Rizzo,2007-07-03 00:47:00,4754,"Great report, them are some pretty fancy worms you were dealing with!"
90255,ehg,2007-07-03 11:43:00,2666,"Those worms look like they might be good for walleye at night! Kinda left a greenish stain on everything,  ehg"
90303,ccmtcanada,2007-07-03 13:38:00,7971,"Great report and it shows how versatile you are!!  Some great pics there.  A deer on the 401 at Whitby?  Wow...now I have never seen that, and I've lived in the Ajax to Oshawa area my whole life!!  Not good news on the carp...hope the MNR figures out what is killing them...and fast!!!!"
90531,mikeh,2007-07-04 01:15:00,824,"Great report, sounds like you had an awsome weekend .Those photos show how hard you worked for those brookies."
90643,ehg,2007-07-04 12:31:00,2666,There seems to be alot of deer down here now. The north part of Pigeon is at least 20 miles by water away from Scugog and there was still dead carp. Maybe the MNR might have an explanation. Had a snag right by a dead carp when retrieving the lure all i could smell was wretched dead carp. Thanks again Mike.   ehg
