After an entire winter of waiting for bass, I rigged up about 10 rods with a variety of different weapons including some, buzz baits, spinner baits, Pig + Jigs, Tubes, and various plastic weed less baits. The weather was perfect with cold nights that created for those picture perfect steaming lake mornings. Top water was defiantly the game plan for the first couple hours. I managed to get a couple nice largemouth on the top water with some great boils to go with it. The keys to our success was fishing 3-8foot weedy heavy cover areas with buzz baits and, Rapala skitter pops in early morning.  Here are some pictures of some large mouth caught on the surface      Joel with his first Canadian Largemouth ever    Joel with another Largemouth    A nice Smallmouth Joel caught on a Jig right off a 15 foot weed edge    Katie with a nice Largemouth on the ultra light tackle    Katie with another nice Bucket mouth   We caught a handful of pan fish including some nice size blue gills, perch and crappie    Little ultra light tackle tournament, Joel hooked up on a small micro jig    As sun came up we ended fishing deeper weed edges and fishing a lot of pockets with jig + pigs. Later in the afternoon once the bite was slowing down, we turned too the ultra light tackle for non stop action.  It was a great time, and I will be back out for the Start of the Great Ontario Salmon Derby this weekend.  Cheers Al www.alsadventures.ca"
