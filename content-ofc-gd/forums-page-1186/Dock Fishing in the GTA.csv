I know I've heard of some ponds at Downsview park? Or some in Richmond hill area, can people recommend their favorite dock/shore to fish from that isnt too far away (<45 minutes) from Toronto? It will be him and father, Thanks."

Heartlake and Humber Bay Park are other alternatives to the Island.  The Island will offer you plenty of differnt species if the bass are not cooperating."
