90223,Rich,2007-07-03 07:48:00,3927,"Well Greensot came out and picked myself and the wife up for some fun fishing. We didn't know what to expect as we headed to Dover but the night didn't let us down.  Not only was the bullhead action intense, lol, I managed to hook into a scrappy sheephead.      After that ""Sugarpacket"" got into a little kitty.. more bullheads, then night wore on and we moved further up river.  Next up was Sugarpacket's new personal best channel cat. We didn't weigh it but I estimated it at 8 - 10lbs. It was quite the feat landing it without a net let me tell ya!    Congratulations on the new PB !!  After that she hooked into a beauty carp, about 10 - 12lbs but it was near impossible to land without a net. After several close attempts at tailing the fish it finally swam away with a new lip piercing. Too bad!  It was a great night out at a favourite spot."
90235,Rich Clemens,2007-07-03 09:45:00,3131,"I'll second the congrats on Sugarpacket's PB.   Seems there are quite a few PB's this year, so we'll see who else's record falls.  Congrats again."
