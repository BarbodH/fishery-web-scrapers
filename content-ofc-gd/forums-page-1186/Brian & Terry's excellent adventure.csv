89878,Terry,2007-07-01 18:00:00,14456,"5am seems early to me more like late  night then, morning  to me but I got up and ready to go fishing  with Misfish we hit a river that has lots of undercut banks and hoped to catch a couple of Dawgs/ Hogs/Pigs/Sows...large mouth that is   Misfish said we would use his baits...a bit of field testing  I thought cool get to use free baits....well you would think that would be a good thing...they sure caught a lot of fish and could use one bait for many fish,  stood up well, but now I have to put in a big order to buy a bunch cause the work so well.....  for a real windy day and tons of weeds making boat control a lot of work, I think we did great  here are some of the fish we caught                                    to add to the mix we got some bowfins and pike too..what the heck is a pike doing under a bank   great day Thanks Misfish I had a blast"
89879,fishindevil,2007-07-01 18:07:00,6254,"GREAT CATCH!!!!!!!! nice report terry,you and brian sure did a number on those largemouth,.....and i see those ko-man-chi  baits work real well,they are very nice sized bass for sure,great pics too....thanks for the report....cheers"

89917,misfish,2007-07-01 22:30:00,29133,"Ok heres my story and I,m stick,n to it.  Ok I land in Bradfrord at 5:15 am.I know it,s way to early for Terry so I grab a coffee and a few crullers to hold me over til 6:00 AM.  Ok we meet up and it,s the howdy doo,s and lets get things gong here.   LOL We luanch and off we go.    Was that a log.L M A O. No worries I know where Im going.  Ok now were on plane and were off.  .Aw theres a spot,ok lets get busy. I say Terry, lets try my baits and his eyes are as big as saucers,ok not that big,maybe more like what you talk,n about Willis.LOL He rigs up the puple/pink crawtube on a slip rig and I go with the chartruse/lime on a jig. Well wouldnt you know it,Terry has a fish on right off the bat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BTW.That picturs is missing.Might it be the BOW FIN you caught. We worked our way down the bank and nailed a bucket or two. The river was not as busy I thought it would be,til all of a sudden, a few others pass by us.We hit a number of banks and we did very well,and as you seen from the pic,s.  On our return back,we hit spots that had already been hamered but still did very well. It,s not whos been there ,but whats been there.  Im not bragg,n about the Komanchi baits,but they worked, and thats all that really counts. The fish seem to hang on to them ,long enough to set the hook.Man what ever is in those baits,put it in a bottle,,,,,,,Aw maybe it is.LOL    BTW,you notice I never mention anything about that 6+ bucket you lost eh. Folks this fish was the biggest I have seen live and I was well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,(I,ll let you people think what I was saying,hell it,s nothing what Terry was saying)  Well after talking and telling our tail from today,my oldest wants to head to the river. Guess we,ll be doing the river thing again Monday.  Terry once again,great time on the water and great company.Man you were on them today."
89918,Golfisher,2007-07-01 22:34:00,586,Great outing!
89923,Terry,2007-07-01 23:05:00,14456,"LOL well there were way too many pictures to post them all so I thought my bowfin would be a good one to forget about     yeah, sorry I didn't get the big one to the boat..it was the wind and the weeds and the boat control and trying to reel in and the sun was in my eyes and..  ok..I guess I forgot to set the hook   good luck tomorrow"
89928,Rattletrap2,2007-07-01 23:24:00,1652,"Nice going guys! Considering I have not even had a line in the water at all this year...  Oh well, maybe next week!  I thought for a minute or so there that you had changed boats again. Then I realized that this was probably Terry's Nitro?"
89931,Smokey,2007-07-01 23:44:00,1278,Nice fish guys. That pike sure is a skinny one. Thanks for the pics.
