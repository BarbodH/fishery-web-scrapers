Her prodding got me thinking that I really need to get one for the backyard...she just loves swings. So then my handyman instincts kicked in, LOL! I realise I've probably got enough wood left over from another project to build one. Had some leftover deck stain as well, so all I needed to do the job was a few carriage bolts, a handful of U bolts and some chain, about 15 bucks total. Took me most of the day to complete, and the better part of a 12 pack (Steam Whistle is GREAT beer BTW  ) but it was a fun little project and my daughter Riley loves it!   "

90344,solopaddler,2007-07-03 15:05:00,8605," Hehehe, I don't think so, although I'm thinking of putting in a water slide  .  Thank's guys!"
90492,motv8tr,2007-07-03 22:16:00,2587,"Looks great, she'll enjoy that for a long time to come   but now you'll have to build another one for her friends  Maureen"
90499,Dano,2007-07-03 23:10:00,719,"Nice job man, sweet!"
90659,pikehunter,2007-07-04 13:32:00,1659,Great job! She will never forget the swing that her daddy made for her.
