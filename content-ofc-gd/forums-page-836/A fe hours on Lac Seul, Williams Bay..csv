All fish were caught on plain jigs, most were on the sand bars in 5-16 FOW. We saw a few other boats out there...and most agreed whhen we chatted at the landing that the day was slow. We still got a few fish over 20 inches our limit of 17-18 inchers a load of small pike, i even got into a 19 inch bass for good measure, i expected more as we have done really well there before...but i aint complaining...honest  Here's a few pics/vids of the days events                                                "
