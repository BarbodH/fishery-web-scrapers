Went to the local lake for a try. Second cast hit this little pike on a chartruse spinnerbait. Fished around for an hour with nothing else. BTW it was mmmmm mmmmm gooooood!   
350024,pokerdemon4,2009-06-09 02:37:00,135,Nice catch.  Whats the biggest pike you have seen come from that lake?

350099,johnnyb,2009-06-09 12:35:00,3413,"When I saw the post title, I was thinking Huntsville...obviously this is a different Fairy Lake...anything else in there besides pike?"
350109,jediangler,2009-06-09 12:50:00,1923,I think there are largemouth and black crappie in there as well as WGSF and pumpkinseed.
350118,johnnyb,2009-06-09 12:59:00,3413,WGSF?!?!?  sold!!!
350227,SylvanOwner,2009-06-09 16:51:00,266,"Ha, that may have been me with the pike through the ice and for that lake it was a real good one.  I've caught crappie as well but they are stunted.....tough to get over 8 inches or so.  Halton Region stopped drawing water from there as a water source a few years back and there's been some concerns over water quality as a result.  Don't know if there's anything to it but I don't eat much from there anymore.  Congrats on your success."

350305,highdrifter,2009-06-09 20:39:00,2534, Frenchies can eat 4 more than the recommended limit doncha know!!
350309,drwxr,2009-06-09 20:54:00,453,i though it was fairy lake in newmarket at first.
