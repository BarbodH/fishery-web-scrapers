(The screw is ok, just the threads that are in the lower unit)  How can I fix this? Will a ""form-a-thread"" type epoxy work? Or is there something else I should try?  Please help!  Thank-You!!"

350042,Bondar,2009-06-09 03:26:00,817,"yea heli coil,  or go to a size bigger plug and re drill and re tap same idea but a heli coil will probably be better in the long run"
