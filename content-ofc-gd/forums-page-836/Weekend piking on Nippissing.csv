Despite the wind and some rain and hail, we had a great time hauling in 30 fish in 3 hours on Saturday morning and another 20 in 3 hours on Sunday morning.  The fish ranged from little guys to 29 inches.  Also lost about 10 more that were on and missed another 10 at the boat.  Weapon of choice was spinner baits as we drifted through the reeds while casting.  Lots of fun and can't wait to go back!"
349461,Dara,2009-06-08 01:33:00,3052,Pics or we don't buy it.   I got to watch all the guys fishing the North Bay shoreline this weekend.  My daughter graduated from Nippissing Uni and I was there for graduation. Shoulda brought the boat
349492,yakpiker,2009-06-08 02:52:00,160,Sure Dara...we'll need to see pics from your daughter's graduation too!  LOL  All pike were released and they weren't big enough to warrant photos.
349553,Greencoachdog,2009-06-08 11:23:00,8163," Well it's just a ""fish story"" then!"
349554,danbouck,2009-06-08 11:24:00,4380, Agreed
349663,Muskieman,2009-06-08 16:27:00,2472,I assume you were fishing in Cache Bay..........  If it was cache bay guys  it's NOT just a fishing story..   RFS
349779,johnnyb,2009-06-08 20:05:00,3413,No pictures and only 5 posts?!?!  Don't expect any pats on the back from THIS club    Tongue planted firmly in cheek!  Way to go...nice to know that Nipissing pike still gobble up spinnerbaits...what's your colour choice?  I'm partial to white and green when out that way...
349794,Dara,2009-06-08 20:37:00,3052,   Here ya go.     She warrants a photo   what the heck are dynamic pages
349860,yakpiker,2009-06-08 22:46:00,160,"Randy is right...we were in Cache Bay...and thanks for supporting my version of the events...fishermen are so skeptical!  hee hee  JohnnyB...white was the killer colour on Saturday with silver blades in the sunshine and with a west wind.  On Sunday it was darker and the wind was from the north so we kept changing colours until figuring out that black with silver blades was working best.  Dara, I was kidding about posting your daughter's photo...don't think she would be too impressed."
