We call them ""crappie delights"". If you don't have a basket, they can be laid out on tinfoil or a thin baking sheet on the grill."
349428,bigugli,2009-06-08 00:18:00,6138,"Great recipe for the BBQ grill.  Grill some onion, sweet pepper, etc...(your choice), leave in reserve.. Now wrap  individual fillets in prosciutto. Put on the grill, low heat, 10 minutes, lid closed.  After 10 mins. gently flip each piece, place a thin slice of a mild white cheese ( mozzarella, friulano, jack, etc...) cook for 5 more.  Once done serve with the the grilled veggies as a side, or 2 fillets on a bun as a monster sandwich with the veggies as the garnish. Real yummy. Works with any white fleshed fillet."
349456,splashhopper,2009-06-08 01:17:00,2931,i am getting real hungry now.... sounds good so far... and simple too  any more recipies out there?
349572,Garry2Rs,2009-06-08 12:20:00,1425,A friend suggested that I try steaming instead of frying the fillets. It was delirious.  I don't think I will fry Crappie anymore.
349642,blaque,2009-06-08 15:39:00,2419,"Ironic thread as i just found a bunch of crappies over the weekend and it had been the first time ive caught one of these guys in YEARS. My comment is, they seemed to have a stronger fish odor than say a smallie, or what have you. Before i released them all, i would smell themn to make sure i wasnt goofy, and they Stink lol"
349645,blaque,2009-06-08 15:42:00,2419," well if your getting delirious off of steaming the fillets, then i definitely suggest going back to frying."
349848,splashhopper,2009-06-08 22:16:00,2931,My wife says I am delirious most days.... so this could be just the right recipe for me!
