I have yet to get one at the french . I always stay on the Dokis Reservation. If anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated. I have used allot of bucktails."

I can't remember how far up the mouth of the French is from Dokis, but, if you can get up there, around Twilight Bay, Canoe Pass, Gibraltar Point there's some pretty good muskie water in there.  I've said too much already!"
