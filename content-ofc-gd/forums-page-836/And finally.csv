349894,JohnF,2009-06-08 23:27:00,3494,I hear a lot of talk about poppers etc at dusk. Anyone had much luck with any of these at any time of the day?  I've had some luck with the little Heddon Torpedo in the evening.  
349896,richyb,2009-06-08 23:29:00,774,That rapala skitter pop is one of my fav's
349901,Billy Bob,2009-06-08 23:34:00,5865,"Two years ago on Stoney Lake we had a ball with top water lures on shallow rock reefs on largemouth bass. Even a few smallmouths were hitting them. THEN just as it was getting dark my reel backlashed and I lost the hot top water lure as it broke off and kept on going somewhere. The next morning with a onshore breeze I thought I could find it but no luck.  But anyways, this was really the first time I had great success using top water plugs. Early morning and evenings seem to be the time they worked the best. We had our limit of walleyes so we played with the bass. Boy that lake has a healthy population of largemouth, I will say that.  BTW if I remember correctly the hot lure that I lost looked a lot like the top left lure in your picture.  Bob"
349902,johnnyb,2009-06-08 23:36:00,3413,#1 - the gold and pink jobbies...just 'walk the dog' ... dynamite! #2 - tied between jitterbug and tiny torpedo...just fast enough of a retrieve so that you can hear plip-plop-plip-plop...and the smallies will SMASH them
349918,Roy,2009-06-09 00:00:00,13728,"The 3 on the right, vertically from the top.  Crazy Krawler. Hula Popper and Jitterbug have worked well for me for at least 40 years. I have no Crazy Krawlers left now though. The last few years, the Pop-Rs and Moss Boss/Slad Spoon have been working well. On a dead calm day over and through weeds  better early mornings and evenings though. Pitch dark nights is a fantastic time.  Biggest error committed with those baits is setting the hook too fast. Lots will instinctively set the hook when they see or hear the splash. Not good."
349933,Joey,2009-06-09 00:24:00,9122,#3 on the left is one of my favorites.  Usually gets bass most times.  Joey
349938,Radnine,2009-06-09 00:29:00,1538,Love Hula Poppers and Jitterbugs. I have a bunch of both. I have found that the hooks get tangled on both lures and have taken to removing the belly hook on both or putting a substantially smaller one on. Still my favourite type of fishing though. Jim
349947,Garry2Rs,2009-06-09 00:45:00,1425,"Top left looks like a Pop ""R"" they are a great top water bait. The Rapala Skitter pop is very good too. The Jitter Bug is a strange old and very successful bait that I have caught Musky on. I know some guys swear by Hula Poppers, but I never had any luck with them. However, the ones I used might have been imitations. Crazy Crawler...I don't know about, I never owned one. The Torpedo is a good bait. The last couple aren't old enough...hahaha...I have no experience with them."
349962,Bondar,2009-06-09 01:04:00,817,"Love fishing with poppers !!!! they work all day as long as its calm out Crappie smash em, small and large mouth , Pike one of my favourite ways to fish when just out playing around in the boat  or off a dock early morning or before dark my new favourite ones are the XPS poppers from Bass pro they go down to a nice panfish size and  bigger"
349965,JohnF,2009-06-09 01:05:00,3494,I forgot my new ChugBug.  JF
349969,tbayboy,2009-06-09 01:09:00,1497,John I've had great luck on the Grand using the top left style (I was using a Rebel popR but same thing) for smallies at all times of the day - in fact my last day on the Grand last year my favourite one broke off on a backlash and floated down river past me - I nearly cried because that lure had been so good to me
349973,JohnF,2009-06-09 01:14:00,3494, I'm pretty sure that's a Dollar store special. I plan to give it new hooks before I try it this year.  One thing I've noticed is that there are obviously a number of brand names that buy their blanks from the same supplier and just add paint and differing qualities of hooks. I've seen a lot of repeats.  JF
349978,MCTFisher9120,2009-06-09 01:25:00,3761,Skitter pop is my best topwater poper. Use it slowly with loud pops and you will get results.
349979,Raf,2009-06-09 01:28:00,3495,jitterbug for the win!! i've caught an amazing amount of fish on that lure.
349989,bigpikemike,2009-06-09 01:50:00,52,my friggin wife uses a jitter bug in black every night at dusk and creams me...i never get anything but follow ups...and she catches pigs with them!
350030,HTHM,2009-06-09 02:52:00,4082,I see you have the $1.25 that I lost....
