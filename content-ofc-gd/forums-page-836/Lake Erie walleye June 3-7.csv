349666,Bob Devine,2009-06-08 16:41:00,251,"Just finished 5 days of walleye fishing on Lake Erie and it was non stop action. We fished 20-30 ft of water pulling harnesses and getting limits each day. As I posted about 10 days ago the walleye fishing was heating up and it is in full swing now. Others are pulling small dipsies and spoons with good succes too. Our largest of the wknd was 30.5"" with lots of 25-28"" fish to release and once again keeping those smaller ""eater"" walleyes. Looking forward to a couple days of musky casting this wk and back to walleye fishing on the wknd.   "

This Sat June 13 is the annual Colchester derby that attracts more than 350 anglers in search of the longest walleye. It is only $20/person with LOTS of door prizes, and beverage and food tent. The host is Canada's first PWT winner Greg Horoky. http://derby.hcslions.com/2008-winners"
