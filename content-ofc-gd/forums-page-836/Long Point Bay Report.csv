We chucked everything we had at them and didn't even get a sniff.  After a few hours we decided to switch it up and get some perch. I figured I would try my 3"" emerald shiner gulp alive. After 45 minutes of absolutely no bites we decided we had to head in for some live minnows to see if that would work.  Well we got back to the spot dropped a couple minnows and BANG!!! 12"" perch  We caught about 25 perch in no time so I figured I better try the gulp again... nothing. Switched back and perch were hitting again.  Ended up catching about 75 perch, 4 WGSF, a couple sunfish, a huge sheephead and an OOS smallie in about 2 hours after we got the minnows. Unfortunately no pike for the day.  It was a great relaxing day on the water and the rain even stayed away.   Dan"
