349634,hirk,2009-06-08 15:28:00,571,"I fished it heavily for 7yrs since I had a trailer there and it's nothing special for Pike/walleye,just stop when you hit Quinte and get fishing"
349636,gone_fishin,2009-06-08 15:30:00,481,"the walleye are generally pretty small in West, so are the pike... the walleye fishing is not as good as it used to be in there... a few years ago it was really hot, but a lot of the locals would keep their limit every day, some would keep more than their limit every day (and that's not an exaggeration - i saw it first hand)... there are also a lot of bass in West, obviously not in season yet... again mostly small though.  if you catch a fish over 3 pounds it is a good fish for that lake, and it should be released.  if you want big fish - go to Quinte"
349639,Stoty,2009-06-08 15:32:00,2910,"If you're going to drive that far, drive the extra and hit up Weller's Bay or The Bay of Quinte. Fishing is a little better there, in my experiences."
349640,gone_fishin,2009-06-08 15:33:00,481, Weller's is a closer drive than West... you have to pass it to get to West.
349796,johnnyb,2009-06-08 20:38:00,3413," And let's not forget the numerous nets strung throughout the lake...  good fishery, but, like others have said...lots of small stuff.  I've fished it a few times, lots of fun with the bass, ran into 2 walleye accidentally, lots of small pike."
