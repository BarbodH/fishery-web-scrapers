349377,basketclam,2009-06-07 22:02:00,115,I'd like to hook into some catfish or bullheads in the Grey-Bruce area.  Has anybody got advice on bait?  Waterbodies/locations?  Time of day?  I've spent a few evenings on the Saugeen using beef liver piled high with garlic salt and haven't had a bite yet.  Any help would be well appreciated.
