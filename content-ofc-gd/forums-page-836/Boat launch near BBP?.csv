350021,Cudz,2009-06-09 02:33:00,2652,Are there any launches near big bay pt?  I know there is one in Gilford but I was wondering if there were any closer to bbp either on the cooks bay side or the kbay side.

350065,Cudz,2009-06-09 04:24:00,2652,Yeah I knw where you are talking about but I have a 2wd truck.  I don't know if there is anywhere to park a trailer either.

350079,Cudz,2009-06-09 10:34:00,2652,Yeah I know that one.  A bit far down and the ramp is not too good at all.  I will go there if all else fails.  Thanks
