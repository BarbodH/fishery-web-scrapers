349809,Tybo,2009-06-08 21:03:00,1373,"Manger at work son has PRADER WILLI syndrome. A day camp that thees kids visit is on a lake. The camp has no fishing rods to supply the kids with. He brought some rods in himself, but the kids love fishing and there is not enough to go around.  So I ask the people of this board, from the kindness of your hearts, if you could send a rod and reel in good working condition to this address.  P.TYBORSKI 18 Brightway cres. Richmound Hill  Ont. L4C 4Z9   Thank you very much."
