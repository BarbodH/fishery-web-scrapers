348963,ccmtcanada,2009-06-06 20:28:00,7971,"This weekend started a bit early.  My wife had half a day off, my little one was off on a PA day, so I played a little hooky and went home at lunch.  Our plan was to hit Lake Scugog and fish from mid afternoon til just before sunset.  With dinner packed and the boat ready to go, we hit the road and launched around 4pm.  It was a little windy, but not too bad.  We headed for a big weedline that is about perfect this time of year in the area we were fishing.  It wasn't long before we started hitting some fish...  Some perch...     Crappie...   WGSF...   And I managed my first walleye from that lake!!   We were having a great time out there...we fished until about 830 in the evening...     PART TWO... This morning, Bly had to head up north to see our oldest daughter at her camp, so it was just me and Sydney.  I asked her what she wanted to do and she said ""FISH AGAIN!!!""   So....pack up a few things for lunch and off we went to a local conservation that has a pond with some stocked panfish.  We were not there long and she started catching.     After a bit of lunch we went for a walk by a nearby stream.  She wanted to walk into the water, so I said ""Sure...but dont let it go over your boots"".   After doing that for a bit, she said ""Daddy...can I go further into the water??"".  I figured, what the heck...go for it!   She then says ""LOOK DADDY!!! FISH!!! I WANNA FISH AGAIN!!!""   I rigged up a makeshift float setup, showed her what to do and she says ""Ok...got it...looks easy"". LOL.  Not too long after that she catches her first trout...I didn't tell her to pose this way...she said ""I wanna look like the others on your fishing site...wait...let me get in the water too"" LOL   One more fish from the creek and we were ready to head home...   It's been a GREAT two days so far....Bly and I are headed muskie fishing tomorrow morning.  Weather going to be cooler and rainy, but we wont care...hope to report some success tomorrow!"

348965,Big Cliff,2009-06-06 20:34:00,6899,Fantastic report and pics!  Well done Sydney!
348983,danbouck,2009-06-06 21:48:00,4380,Great pics and Report
348987,solopaddler,2009-06-06 22:02:00,8605," There's absolutely zero response to that.  Great stuff Cliff, good luck on the musky hunt!"
348991,JohnF,2009-06-06 22:13:00,3494," You really don't want an old fart like me saying yer cute, do ya? That would be several degrees past total weirdness. I draw the line at saying yer a helluva fisherman, and I'd really like to get to spend some time on the water with you, but cute you ain't. Your wife may see it differently, hopefully. My mom thinks I'm cute. My wife says ""eeeehhhh"" as she waggles her fingers, but deep down I think she really does. Of course I've had 40 odd years (and some of them were really kinda odd) to sell her on the concept. Now she just seems to tolerate me.  JF"
348995,Joey,2009-06-06 22:23:00,9122,Great report Cliff.  Sydney's such a great little fisher gal  Joey
