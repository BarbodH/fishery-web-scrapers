It's a small lake just norteast of Parry Sound (forgot the name ...again)  Went out Sat morn and he was killing me. He caught 2-3 Pike and a couple smallies and I caught one small fish.  Went out again Sun and I'm trying to figure out what he is doing different. I tie on an almost identical white Rap with a red head ... instant success. None of the fish were huge, but fun. Then the darndest thing ... it started to snow ... on May 31st! What wacky weather we are getting this year. We caught about 8 pike in 3 hrs.      Good trip. I threw spinners, spinnerbaits, and other shaped Raps. All they seemed to want were the light body with a red head."

349803,johnnyb,2009-06-08 20:54:00,3413,Not a bad way to spend the weekend...surprising that pike would be that picky on colour!  Did it happen to be Portage or Mill Lake?
350000,Banger68,2009-06-09 02:03:00,157,I was trying a fat rap shaped crankbait and a regular Rap so the shape was a little different to. But they ignored the spinner and spinnerbait too.  It might have been Sparrow lake? I'll ask the boss at work tomorrow.
350107,johnnyb,2009-06-09 12:48:00,3413,Crazy....I'm all about the spinners for springtime pike...good thing you were willing to switch up!
350138,Banger68,2009-06-09 13:58:00,157,I've always used spinnerbaits for Pike this time of year too. But I've never fished in the snow in June (almost) so ...
