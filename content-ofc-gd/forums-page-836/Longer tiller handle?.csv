Seems I have to stretch a bit to reach the handle from my little clamp on seat; would be nice if it was closer....if there is, is it easy to install? thx PS  was in Gloucester Pool today trying to find the ever elusive walleye up there; kinda skunked but weather wasnt that great! Oh well, at least I wasn't at work today!!  hardly any cottagers too,,nice and quiet up there for sure! I'll find em one of these days! thx guys"

349814,GeorgeJ,2009-06-08 21:13:00,207,"I could use one for my Yamaha too, it seems probably about 6"" too short. If someone has used one of those HelmsMate's extensions maybe they can let us know how they are."
349857,Bondar,2009-06-08 22:40:00,817,there are some on Cabelas website as well but the reviews dont look to hot
349861,Sinker,2009-06-08 22:47:00,8692,"Yep, just split a length of 1.5"" black ABS pipe on one end, and clamp it on your existing handle. Works perfect.  Sinker"

349981,ColdH20guy,2009-06-09 01:29:00,312,so how do you access your throttle grip with the pipe clamped around it and in the way? cut out that area? thx  
349985,Dnthmn,2009-06-09 01:34:00,128,You actually clamp the pipe so that it is on the throttle grip. You turn the pipe and the grip turns with it
349986,ColdH20guy,2009-06-09 01:40:00,312,ahhhhh.okay thx
