Judy dropped me off at the park before 8 and I walked in to my secluded spot. Got a mixed assortment for the early part of the day.     I was having quite the morning out there all by myself.  The blue in the last pic was5-6 lb. but he was all head.  About 11, my tranquility was shattered by the brood.  They decided to hunt me down for the day and share some time.  Wasn't long before we were all furiously hooking into fish. The daughter's first cat , and she won't go near one to touch it.  Amy's first cat, same problem   ( the son's main squeeze)  Jr. Playing net minder for me.  The fight was pretty hot on a few of the larger fish we were catching. Lots of head shakes and runs.     The girls were still having fun as well.    At the end of it all, I'm so glad they came out and joined me for the day. We don't do enough of this any more. It was a lot of fun.   I think some will have serious sunburns to deal with tonight"
