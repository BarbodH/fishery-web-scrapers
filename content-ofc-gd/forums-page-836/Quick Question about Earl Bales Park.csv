Hope this helps, I'll see if I can get you a site to download the publication."

350194,Nemo,2009-06-09 15:31:00,727,The River flows straight through there but I have never seen anyone fishing. I doubt there is much in that stretch as it is canalized and fairly shallow with little structure.
350196,Toronto_Angler,2009-06-09 15:33:00,698,I know there is small carp just north at G Ross Lord park...Just careful if you go there after dark not the safest area.
350197,Victor,2009-06-09 15:38:00,1609,"i have seen people fish for (and catch) carp and bullhead at G Ross Lord, have also caught tiny pumpkinseed over there. I probably should try fishing for carp there with it being only a 10 minute drive from my place, the smell/color of the water kinda turns me off though."
350220,izaakwalton,2009-06-09 16:23:00,27,"There are carp in G Lord Ross.  But, as noted by others, it is not a very scenic or pleasant place to fish.  If you're looking for urban fishing, you're better off going downtown to The Beaches or The Islands."
350314,rbaquial,2009-06-09 21:04:00,968,"Yeah... actually they just re-informed me its ""G Lord Ross"" that where we'll be going to this Saturday.  Thanks for the input none the less RoB"
