What type of structures should I look for? Same as ice fishing spots? Depth?  Thanks for any info  ps. We went to BOQ last weekend and the Walleye bite was on fire. Caught our limit befor 10am. We fished near Deseronto. Worm spinner in chartuse, and suprisingly BRIGHT RED!"
349972,Guest gbfisher,2009-06-09 01:12:00,0,You need an anchor to do it properly. A Williams ice jig in half and half hammered worked slowly on bottom will get you fish. Look for fish from 60 to 90 fow. When you mark some fish Stop and Anchor    Good luck.
