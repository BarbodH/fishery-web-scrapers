142158,tbayboy,2007-12-13 00:59:00,1497,That was a great read.  Next years goal is definitely to take up fly fishing.
142161,huntervasili,2007-12-13 01:02:00,1604,Great read there SP ... Thanks for sharing
142184,Moosebunk,2007-12-13 01:53:00,3970,Didn't all HOT girls in the 70's just go naked and put out any chance they got.  This girl seemed like a tease for her time.  He was better to go with the bow.  Now... had she shown more skin and been more inviting.....
142194,irishfield,2007-12-13 02:21:00,26272,I had a dream like that once... dang maybe it wasn't a dream...

142282,ccmtcanada,2007-12-13 13:45:00,7971,Great read Mike...sounds like most of my outings....minus the girl....and oh yeah...minus the fly fishing part.  LOL.  Actually the only part that rings familiar is the lack of stream fish....
142288,Terry,2007-12-13 14:12:00,14456,"so the moral of the story is????????????  don't judge a book by it's cover  or if you see a girl in a bikini oiling  herself, do what see tells you   or a real fisherman would rather play with his rod, then a half naked girl  or never take yourself too serious or some bikini wearing dumb blonde will show you up      or if you have a half naked blonde girl in a raft and you are lying on your back holding your rod put it where she tells you to  I don't know but there just does need to be a moral"
