He was born at the shelter with a litter of 8 others and is now getting used to being a farm dog. His name is Hunter and he has a nose that he uses very effectivly finding all of the bunny,deer and squirell trails that were made in the farm. Here are a few shots of him when he was 2 months old.     Art"

142241,Tarzan's Jane,2007-12-13 08:22:00,1183,Hunter is a handsome little guy...but the puppy stage is a killer. BTW...do ya think you could benefit from some photography lessons...     gotta keep heads in the pics. Who's the other fella sneaking in a pose?

142286,Greencoachdog,2007-12-13 13:58:00,8163,"The ears and tail are too short for that dog to be a Coon hound, that is definately a Possum hound... and a darn fine specimen at that!!!  Hope y'all like Possum stew..."
142356,Beans,2007-12-13 19:18:00,3339,"Nice lookin' pup...would fit right in with the Walker Hounds my neighbor has penned up out back near the woods...That is all but ""Dirty Gerty""...she is the only one that learned how to escape by climbing over the pen...I used to catch her and keep her on a running line until her owner got home...that is until I found out she was quite capable of climbing back in on her own...  Here she is in the back yard right now...   Not a very good picture but she won't come too close to me anymore...I wonder why ?"
