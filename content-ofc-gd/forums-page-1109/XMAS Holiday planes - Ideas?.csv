About as much fun as you can have - sober with yer' clothes on that is... (ok scratch the sober thing) Every time we go we see all ages from Toddlers to old folks.  just a thought.  Hookset."

142588,Hookset,2007-12-14 16:37:00,367,This is where we go each New Years http://www.rockridgetubing.com/  It may be a little far for you though. Hopefully you can find one closer that is open on X-Mas.   Hookset.

142685,Hookset,2007-12-14 22:45:00,367," Ya Brian, and in groups of 10 or more it's cheaper again. When we were there for New Years last year they had a Bar, Food, a big fire, and the Tunes were cranked. Think we tubed until midnite then they had fireworks and everyone wobbled back onto the bus. Opening trout the next morning was a killer. And no, I don't work there lol.  Hookset."
