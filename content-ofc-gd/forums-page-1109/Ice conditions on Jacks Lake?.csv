139839,cheese,2007-12-05 15:20:00,27,Anyone hear of any ice on Jacks Lake? Buddy said sleds were on Scugog last night!!! Sharpen the auger blades and get the survival suit ready...... no boats on Scugog Jan1 this year! Play it safe everyone!
141328,cheese,2007-12-10 19:00:00,27,Thanks for all your help.... I went anyway and kicked ass. Crappie city and a few pics (released of course!)
141340,Terry,2007-12-10 19:34:00,14456,I would assume no one knew how it was or they would answered  but you have been there so how much ice is there..what are the conditions   and good to see the crappie are bitting
141351,Beans,2007-12-10 20:01:00,3339,Our info source doesn't usually get back to us until after New Years so I was hoping to see someone answer your thread...  Nice to hear you are keeping the crappie in fighting trim...
142113,Jigatollah,2007-12-12 23:13:00,53,How are the ice conditions? I take it it's walkable then.
142245,Photoz,2007-12-13 09:41:00,792,"Did I detect just a hint of sarcasm in your SECOND post, when no one had the info you wanted? Naw w w  w   w . . . .  .    likely just my imagination?"
142323,Terry,2007-12-13 16:36:00,14456,"that might be....LOL  but I see he is any better at sharing, then the guys he was hoping would  share with him...LOL"
142405,Jigatollah,2007-12-13 23:35:00,53,"Apparently he's shy at answering . If I make it out there this weekend,I'll let you know how thick the ice is."
142412,Terry,2007-12-14 00:22:00,14456,thanks
