139831,Smokey,2007-12-05 15:00:00,1278,Awesome Buck Chris. Nice to see someone having some success so far. I decided this week I'm going to have a muzzleloader for next year. I had this week off and sat at home so far waiting for the muzzleloader season to end so I can get back to bow hunting. So for sure next year I'm going to have one to extend my time in the bush.  Congrats and Enjoy  Mike
139968,ChrisK,2007-12-06 00:02:00,2772,"Just got back in from my day out hunting. My good friend Jim took a button buck this morning...Thats two hangin in the barn now !!!! Wonder what tomorrow will bring us. Just to let everyone know,the tenderloins of my buck where carved out and cooked up the same day I shot him. Absolutely delicious !!!!!  Cheers !!"

140005,cisco,2007-12-06 01:32:00,597,Congrats!   Very interesting rack on that deer. Kinda palmated in spots.
140054,Fishnfiend,2007-12-06 14:17:00,357,"Conragtulations!  I still have two tags to fill (only bought two).  Brian, take a sled or toboggan in the back of your truck when you go hunting.  If you get one, it will make the drag through deep snow way easier."
140565,ChrisK,2007-12-08 00:02:00,2772,Well today was a beautiful day. Only minus 1 which made it one of the warmer days of the week. Started off with a morning sit which brought nothing and then did a drive at about 10.30am. Our dogger put up five does to me and I chose the biggest and let a shot go. thank god for ATV's or it would of took forever to drag her up out of that ravine.  Anyhow we have one more day to hunt after today and one more tag to fill.....  Cheers !!!
