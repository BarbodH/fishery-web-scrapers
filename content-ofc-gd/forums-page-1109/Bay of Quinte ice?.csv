142236,DT10Sam,2007-12-13 04:36:00,480,"Hi Urbanangler,  I would say that the ice is not safe as of yet.  There are a couple of local fisherman that know where it is safe to fish and they know where the currents are etc. to stay clear of those areas.  My opinion would be to wait for a week or two and it should be safe to go out and fish.  As ice conditions improve I will be pleased to post them on this forum so that everyone does not just drive up to be disappointed not being able to get out and fish.  Regards, Sam"
