Looking for good fishin, nice housekeeping cabin w/ running water + showers, good boats, + remoteness. Was wondering if anyone has any insight into Beauchene and how it stacks up to esnagami or leuenbergers out of nakina, which look like the second option.  Thank you! Schnaggs"

I said but you said walleye fishing was fine he said you can do all the walleye fishing you want on the main lake..  so I asked so where do I fish for them out there.. his answer, I really do know no one really ever catches them on this lake, but the bass and trout fishing is great..say what.. so I said I would like to fish for bass where Bob Isumi was fishing for them on his show.. his answer...you will not find any bass there Bob fished that lake for his show before the season opened  so I felt they were not honest with me so I would never go back"
141753,Jigster,2007-12-11 21:42:00,33,"Wow thank you Terry & Irishfield. So you're saying you've never dealt with the new management? Currently dealing with a guy called ""Tony"" who, up to this point, seems pretty good... Thank you though for the heads up! Anyone else out there been to this place under the new management?"
141755,irishfield,2007-12-11 21:50:00,26272,Just was being cautions because you didn't specify a date. Some fishing opportunities have been lost in the Spring in many zones.
