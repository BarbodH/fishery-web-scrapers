142180,irishfield,2007-12-13 01:45:00,26272,Will give him time to write another good book Jed !  The only mistake Conrad ever made was taking his company public.
142192,POLLIWOGG,2007-12-13 02:12:00,835,"I think he just forgot he took the company public, could have happened to anybody."
142197,irishfield,2007-12-13 02:24:00,26272,"  Oh.. and maybe the $86,000 toilet !"
142249,Dano,2007-12-13 10:50:00,719, No kidding. Marrying that icon of overindulgence and extravagance Barb didnt help either.
142272,pikehunter,2007-12-13 13:21:00,1659,"Commit a crime and get to spend your next 6 or 7 winters in sunny south Florida at an all inclusive establishment! Such a deal, think I better go out and take a Chicago widow to the cleaners for all she's got, then fight it in court and join Conny in Fla.  Why don't they have a prison in the arctic?"
142299,JFR,2007-12-13 14:49:00,498,"The results look good on the pompous windbag, and he has to do 85% of the sentance B4 elegible for parole"
142303,1leggedangler,2007-12-13 15:08:00,364,"Should have just written the cheque at the begining of this whole fiasco when he had the chance. Big ego's always get in the way. Funny how he is trying to get his Canadian citizenship back. I say ney, he can wear his British Lordship robes in the pokey."
142308,Headhunter,2007-12-13 15:17:00,5703,"Three squares a day (I understand it's tube steak on Saturdays! yum yum) and a roomy... and something about bubbles! I hope Barby can hold out for Connie, for the next 6-7 years... I bet by the time he gets out, he won't recognize her... face all pulled back and lookin""young"" HH"
142315,Roy,2007-12-13 15:59:00,13728,Everyone would have been better off with him remaining in charge of Hollinger and everything else.  Maybe we should take a read on Peter C. Newman's stuff...start with the Establishment Man.
142329,TJQ,2007-12-13 16:58:00,7806, Ditto!!
142345,Nemo,2007-12-13 18:02:00,727,I agree with Roy ..... he took some liberties not disputing that but one should judge the man's record in it's totality.  Establishment Man is an interesting read.
