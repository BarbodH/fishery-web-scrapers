I'm sure with LB's the ontario stores are one business number in Ontario and the Quebec one is another. If they file seperate tax returns.. no body has ever clicked to it I'm sure, and I ain't calling CRA on their behalf ! LOL"
142319,fishinggeek,2007-12-13 16:20:00,325,"I was contemplating buying a membership at Le Baron's for so long now.  At $25 a year and 10% discount, I have to spend over $250 a year there to make it worthwhile.  I am sure I spend more than that a year there, so maybe I'll buy that before I do my Christmas shopping."
142321,irishfield,2007-12-13 16:25:00,26272,"You can buy it in the store as your first purchase, while holding all your items to ring thru next. What I did a couple years back when I bought two downriggers in the Mississauga store to save 10%."
141346,irishfield,2007-12-10 19:43:00,26272,"Well this great pricing is worthless when you get an email back from them that states..  ""Sorry, your order is cancelled.  The items that you ordered are back order till February 08. Please re-order at that time. Thank you.""  Simply amazing that Penn doesn't have inventory nor does Cannon for the retrievers and emergency crank handle I ordered.  Christ... you'd think mine or Deg's wife was working their order desk !"

141487,John Bacon,2007-12-11 02:04:00,3277," Actually, if you have a business presence in Ontario (three stores would qualify as a presence) then you are required to charge PST on online orders shipped into Ontario from other provinces.  This rule applies to most provinces.  I am not sure if LeBaron's has discovered a loophole or just hasn't been caught.  Regardless, if you are not charged PST then you would be required to self assess and remit them yourself... I am sure that you will do the right thing"
