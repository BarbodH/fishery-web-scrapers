138590,Canuck2fan,2007-12-01 21:35:00,1444," Lostchild technically you right it is private property but I guess you missed the part about him going into BPS and purchasing a small item that act on his part gives him the right to park there..... as long as he had a valid receipt dated that day I don't see a cop charging him with ""tresspassing"" as he was shopping if people happen to see what happens with his boat that is another matter entirely.... You can't stop people from rubber necking at anything that looks interesting LOL. Ever drive on the 400?"
138591,Fisherpete,2007-12-01 21:37:00,1814,"Don't worry, I will not be doing the water fill demonstration in their parking lot any time soon, it's just not my style. I will be emailing all the execs on Monday and trying the more diplomatic approach.  Here's the summary if anyone missed something along the way... I bought the boat, used and a little over 1 year old,  in a private sale from a guy this May. He had the boat in his apartment building's underground parking, where it had been stored for the winter, so I did not have a chance to take the boat on the water for a leak test, my bad, but the boat-motor-trailer + ton of accesories was a really good deal regardless, so I still took it. I switched the boat's license to my name the next day and got my plates for the trailer. I was given the original bill of sale, and manufacturers statement of origin, but no warranty documents. I went to the Tracker website, looked up the specs on the boat, and saw that the boat has a 5 year riveted structural warranty. First time on the water, I notice some water in the bottom of the boat, but because I have some plywood & marine carpeted flat floors down, I wasn't too concerned, and actually thought that the water may have come over the transom in when I was reversing (it was choppy out). After a few more trips, and water getting in even on calm days, I began to think the boat may have a leak. It is now probably July or August. Some time in September, after coming home from a day on the lake, I decided to take the garden hose and put some water in the boat to see if there was a leak, and was shocked to see an entire row of rivets dripping away under the boat. Well, my thinking at this point is that I have dealt with the water all summer, I am not missing fall Muskie season, I might as well fish until closing and then bring the boat in to Tracker/BPS to see what they can do for me. Last week, I contacted Jill Salkeld (Tracker Rep at Vaughn BPS), and she asked me to bring in the boat, which I did. She took a few pictures of the boat, to email to Tracker, and informed me that I needed to switch over the warranty to my name. She gave me a number to call (Tracker US), which I did, and that is where the trouble began. This is where I was informed that there is a policy whereby there is only a 60 day window from date of purchase to transfer the warranty over to my name.  I voiced my displeasure regarding the entire manner, and mentioned that in MY line of work, there are policies, but in order to keep a good customer happy (I told them how much I honestly spend at BPS), rules can be bent at times.  They should stand behind the quality of their product, not the steadfastness of policy. She said she would speak to her supervisor and ask if he could do anything for me. He simply said no. As one of you mentioned, for them to save a few hundred on a relatively simple repair, how much potential $ could they now stand to lose from negative word of mouth?  So, here we are. On Monday, the email will go out, and I hope that they will be able to help me out. I really do like the boat, apart from the indoor swimming pool LOL, and they still have the chance to turn this ""ow"" into a ""wow"", and maybe keep me (and maybe some of you) as a future customer. We shall see... if not, maybe I will be seeing what Wayne's shop looks like...  To be continued..."
138805,addict,2007-12-02 17:46:00,475,when i bought my crestliner some 10yrs ago it had a few leaky rivets instead of pining the rivets i drilled them out coated both sides of the hole with j.b weld used two washer a lock washer and a cap screw (allen key head) this method worked great 10yrs later and still no leaks from the repaired rivets.i do however have leaks from other rivets but now i live with it i only get about a litre of water in the boat after a days fishin.but before u fix anything remember the squeaky wheel gets the grease hound the crap out of tracker eventually the will get sick of u and probally fix the rivets.
138858,Gerritt,2007-12-02 20:40:00,6129,FP...  Here is a link I thought you may find helpful.. it is from a pro consumer site... It will explain in detail what you should and should not do.. in regards to your EECB...  http://consumerist.com/consumer/how-to/how...bomb-259713.php  Gerritt.  I should also mention... Tracker Marine is tmrc llp  Google it
138936,forrest,2007-12-03 00:55:00,1032,"In the first post Fisherpete mentioned that it was Tracker policy that boat warranties had to be transfered within 60 days.  My experience with policies is that companies enforce them when convenient but also ignore them when convenient (even when screwing over a customer).  Policies are more of an ethics thing and a way of keeping a business profitable.  Can anyone tell me why a company would make a policy like this?  Is its sole purpose to get them out of the liability of their own bad workmanship? Electronic, a large appliance and other companies do not enforce this type of Bull, how to boat companies get away with it?    forrest P.S.  I like the idea of contacting the owner and having him sell it back for a $1.  On the surface it sounds like they made a dud, hope it works out."
139299,JPD,2007-12-04 02:42:00,296,"Sounds like the original owner knew he had a problem which is now your problem... not very cool. If it leaked the first day you took it out I can guarantee it leaked the last day he took it out as well.  Bottom line is that this has absolutely nothing to do with BPS like it has already be mentioned. I would be going after the guy that sold it to you but it should have been done ASAP, not after fishing for a year with it.  JP"
139762,Fisherpete,2007-12-05 05:39:00,1814,"My letter has been emailed today to all the Tracker execs that Gerritt listed, I am leaving it up to them whether they want to bend the rules a bit, back the quality of their product and create a possible customer for life, or choose to uphold a fine-print policy and lose one (well, probably lots actually). Stay tuned..."
139765,2 tone z71,2007-12-05 08:18:00,1311,"id still loose it and post a big billboard on the 400 but thats just me lol,good luck hope they see past the bottom line and make things right for you"
139817,pikehunter,2007-12-05 14:22:00,1659,"I wish you the best of luck with Tracker, however you have to face the fact of that you will likely be responsible for the repair and pay for it out of your own pocket, after all you bought a used product.  Chances are the boat was sold because of this problem and you are the recipient of this misfortune. You cannot hold Tracker liable for this repair because it is stated in print that the warranty must be transferred to your name within 60 days, no ifs buts or maybes. I agree it is not good for you and you do whatever you can to get them to pay up however 60 days should be enough time to read all the fine print and ensure that you comply correctly. Remember business is built on the belief that most items are held onto for about 5 years then sold and then they are generally off the hook as far as warranties.  If Tracker does come through for you great!  but chances are that Wayne is going to have another boat to fix before next the fishing season.  Next time buy new, there are reasons why used is cheaper."
139820,lew,2007-12-05 14:34:00,12767, But at least than you'll know it's fixed properly
139840,charlesn,2007-12-05 15:21:00,551,"If the guy who sold it to you lied about about the leaks, how do you know he never hit something?  How would Tracker know?  I think it should be his problem to help you get satisfaction or pay for the repairs properly at Wayne's.  Great offer Wayne, truly a good gesture and a benefit for the Cancer Society too.  I would make sure the guy who sold it to you is doing his damnedest to help you out of this situation.  I hope it works out, our boats are expensive enough at the best of times when things are going good.  They say the two best days of boat ownership are the days you buy it and the day you sell it.  Trials like this are what make that true...  Charles"
139842,Hooked,2007-12-05 15:23:00,891,"  Ok, thats freakin brilliant.  Other than not being able to get a hold of the person, Ricks plan should work."
139942,fishermccann,2007-12-05 22:13:00,655,Yes I agree it has nothing to do with BPS and everything to do with the scamer who sold you that leaker!
142349,Fisherpete,2007-12-13 18:21:00,1814,"Well, I am still in email limbo at the moment - I did hear back from a few of the Tracker execs that I sent my letter to, and it did sound encouraging - but nothing to tell as of yet. I'll keep you posted..."
142376,doubleheader,2007-12-13 21:28:00,497,If it's just rivets you are likely much better off doing the work yourself. I've read numerous reports of guys having their rigs held up for extended periods of time for repairs only to get them back and find the  workmanship 2nd rate. Why Tracker can't figure out that fishermeen talk I don't know.  Not too much to fixing rivets as long as you have a heated garage.  You'll probably find others that are defective but still in place that their repair center won't even bother to replace.

142563,Gerritt,2007-12-14 15:34:00,6129,  Atta boy! hope it works out for you.  G.
138521,walleyemen,2007-12-01 16:14:00,316,"What seems to get really lost in all of this is that It's not the fault of B.P.S And no  i do work for them, It is Tracker marine, do you have the paper work on the boat and warranties info, if so you neglected to read them putting yourself at fault not tracker marine, all means i am not supporting tracker marine, i bought my pro-guide in  05 Unseen ,salesman told me it was a showroom model o4 mint, o.k saved $3500, Went there signed papers, they took me out to give me my boat and man it was trashed 65% of the decal scratched or rubbed off  paint patches missing on the bottom of the hull and several guages as well,( boat apparently had been used at the ontario place boat show unknown to me) needless to say i was unpleased and did not want the boat , service manager came out said if i took the boat they would fix everything, paint decals and anything else i found, and i had him put it in writing. Took the boat back at end o 05 season they painted the boat (very nice job) And redecaled it (terrible job) in the end i had the manager of tracker drive to my house and deliver personally a full decal kit and was allowed to have them put on by a company of my choice payed for by tracker marine.Needless to say this took from dec 05 to may 06 to get done, lots of headaches but they did honor what they said they would do. inthe end the repairs costed them $4000, what did they really save , nothing. Bottom line  you will find everyone has something bad to say about one boat company or other, i suggest if you have the warranty transfer paper or card , back date it, send it out, wait till you receive comfirmation and then go after the warranty work. The guy they have to repair these boats is in barry, personally i could not take anything to this guy, i am guessing you spoke with John Milller at tracker marine? He stands behind his word, i can personally say that, but threats will get you nowares with this guy, trust me it  only prolonged my repairs,I know these things can be frustrating,but they do have procedures like everyone else, if you don't have the warrannty form i have mine in my hand as we speak p.m and i'll send it to you.Look at it this way if ya send it out and it comes back sometime early in the new year, they still have lots of time to get you fixed up before fishing season, Again i,m not praising tracker marine just expressing my experience with them, but you can bet for sure my next boat will not be a tracker,"
138525,Lostchild,2007-12-01 16:25:00,153,
138530,walleyemen,2007-12-01 16:38:00,316,"Why would ya want to do this there? He never purchased the boat from there.You might just aswell take it to Dewidt Honda in SToney Creek and do it there as well, they sell tracker boats, everybosy is missing the big picture here, tracker marine is in Missuri, the boat was a year old, why did the previous owner sell it?Maybe he had problems and covered it up to sell the boat , who knows!Warranty will cover it! Go thru the proper procedures, Why give B.P.S a bad name when he bought it private, Check the rivites and see if they have been hit, if so maybe the guy did this and covered up to sell it, then i would go after the seller."
138531,JPD,2007-12-01 16:40:00,296,Please exhaust all of your options before guaranteeing that they won't help you. Have you dealt with the BPS Tracker department in Vaughan Mills or was it a call to the US?  Just have the original owner call in the job if all other options are used up like Rick said.  Starting a war with BPS will not win you anything since Tracker Marine is a completely separate division in that store. That would be like cutting off your face to spite your nose.  Let me know if you are still having trouble and I could make a call for you. It may or may not help but I can always try.  JP
138534,SlowPoke,2007-12-01 16:46:00,2984, My point exactly. I suspect the folks at BPS would jump at the chance to satisfy you but not at the cost of adopting Tracker's problem. I wouldn't advise compounding the problem by protesting in thier parking lot. -Brian
138550,2 tone z71,2007-12-01 18:26:00,1311,bring it up to Waynes you and him can fix it right dealing with these cuties will just give you a migrane
