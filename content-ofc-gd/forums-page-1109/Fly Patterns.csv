142595,shane,2007-12-14 17:13:00,652,I get most of my fly-fishing/tying info from Hipwader.com. Lots of local stuff in the forums as well.
142610,fishinggeek,2007-12-14 17:57:00,325,"If you're just starting to learn, I suggest going to a local fly fishing club like Izaak Walton's.  Kitchener has one too but I don't recall the name.  It's much more difficult to learn on your own, and other tyers can steer you clear of some of the errors.  But if you're not just starting, sorry I don't have any sites off hand."
