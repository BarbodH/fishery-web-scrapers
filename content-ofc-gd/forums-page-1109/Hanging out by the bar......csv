142411,silveradosheriff,2007-12-14 00:19:00,1025,"OK, so finally got around to taking a picture of the Bert's system on the boat.  There are two 4 foot tracks on the sides with the 8 foot bar across the back.  Here is a pic of the whole system:    One major safety component for the bigger water is that the riggers are mounted much higher up than they were before.  This results in a much easier handling of the rods when the salmon hit, with the bar serving as a safety device as you can brace against it. I'm running the ratchet rod holders which I highly recommend.    Here is a closer shot of the one side:    I'll be running two sets of Salties off the sides for the inline boards and/or dipseys off the braid and wire.     Followed by a side shot:      Still to come is the 9.9 kicker which will be added in the spring. More as an alternate power source as the F-90 does a great job trolling in terms of sound and fuel economy. In the larger rollers, a single point of power failure is not a good thing!  :-)"
