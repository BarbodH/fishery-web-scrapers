141660,snag,2007-12-11 19:00:00,1932,"Found these by accident:  Sorry if it's been posted already!  Apparently, the extraction through the ice hole for these fish was an issue...  Here's the story. All these fish were caught on Tobin Lake, Sask.  This pic claims that this pike weighed 42 pounds. (not 42"")   This guy says ""no way""  ""here is a 34.5 lber from the same lake 48 or 49"" caught two winters ago""  and my 36.5 for comaparison   Impressive!  S."
141667,irishfield,2007-12-11 19:22:00,26272,If everyone had longer arms... they'd be even bigger ! LOL  Not even gonna start guessin weights... let alone lengths
141669,BFSC Kevin,2007-12-11 19:26:00,1351,"42lbs pike? sure does look big.. im not going to guess the weight, but holding a object that is 42 lb right in front of you takes quite a bit of strength..."
141670,trapshooter,2007-12-11 19:27:00,1234,"Either way, those are very nice Pike.   3rd pic is best.. show's how fat that fish is from head to tail."
141686,steverowbotham,2007-12-11 19:55:00,1800,"Saskatchewan or Europe ??  We've all seen these pike before ... from Rainy Lake, Great Slave Lake, Tobin Lake... name the lake.  Real fish but I dont know what to believe as far as where they were angled."
141691,snag,2007-12-11 20:05:00,1932," I hear ya.  They do look Finnish.  As in, are you finnish posting those dang pike pics!  The second 2 are definately from where he said they were.  The first one seems speculative. (mind you I didn't read every post in the thread!)  Here is the thread: Candian pike eh! Ya canada!  This could be an Olympic event?  "
141692,Zib,2007-12-11 20:06:00,369,Those sure are some nice European pike.
141702,joonmoon,2007-12-11 20:24:00,528,"Nice fish, wonder if they were released? Hope they were. Anyway here's a 38"" my other half caught in Nip last ice season....can you say PJ Party...lol. "
141769,FishHeadRic,2007-12-11 22:33:00,226,"Hey Grant,  Theses guys don't look Canadian! Wheres the red plaid jackets?   FHR"
141782,Moosebunk,2007-12-11 23:07:00,3970,"They are real ""Canadian"" pike... well at the very least the third pictured pike is.  That fella belongs to a private site I visit.  Original reports were read last Spring/Winter and the fella got great numbers of big pike from a lake out west."
141791,Guest gbfisher,2007-12-11 23:22:00,0,"I know that the guy in the last picture caught his fish last year out west. The guy stands  6'6 @ 260lbs lol Slays them pikes he does lol  MLPIKEMAN is his name. Heres another ,,,to show the size difference....lol    It weighed 36.8  lbs"

141909,snag,2007-12-12 04:55:00,1932," Thanks Bunk!  The insider info is greatly appreciated.  I believed that the 1st pic is from the same lake; as both proclaim, but the internet is fickle and cunning at times.  besos.  s"
141911,snag,2007-12-12 04:59:00,1932,  Gadzooks!  One hand!  must be blind by now.    it's from the unrelenting glair of the snow.    s
141998,big guy,2007-12-12 17:46:00,414,"I agree Moosebunk. The ""scenery"" looks pretty flat. I don't imagine there is too much of that in Finland."
142013,fishindevil,2007-12-12 18:41:00,6254,"Well weather they are all legit or not ???...they are still very big pike.   and i know i would love to catch one that big,my PB,is 22lbs and i think that one is alot bigger than that for sure !!!   thanks for bringing that to our attention moosebunk !!!! cheers"
