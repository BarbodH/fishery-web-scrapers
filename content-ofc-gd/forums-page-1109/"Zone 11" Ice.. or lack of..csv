142395,lunkerbasshunter,2007-12-13 23:04:00,2585,"not surprised nipissing is shallow and its been cold enought up there to make ice.  the problem is, how safe is it?  they have had lots of snow up there so who knows how thick the ice is.  I think i woudl wait a few weeks just to be safe.  Although i hear the smaller lakes, Like circle lake in north bay is being ice fished everyday and fish are biting.  Cheers!"
142402,irishfield,2007-12-13 23:18:00,26272,Like I said... be VERY VERY careful. There has been ice on the NorthEast Arm of Lake Temagami for a month (since before Remembrance day). It's only 1 to 3 inches thick right now and has been below -15C MANY days up there ! Nip probably isn't a lot better.
142407,Bernie,2007-12-13 23:41:00,3190,Was talking to a fellow today and said the ice on Fish Bay has actually gotten thinner. The show has insulated the ice so much that ground heat has eroded away at what was there before. Long range looks cold for the next few days and the snow has settled some so it should add some inches soon.
