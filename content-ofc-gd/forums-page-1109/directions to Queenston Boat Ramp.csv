I'm coming from Toronto-area and I know I'm taking the QEW, I just figured someone else might know specifically where to go so I'm not guessing. (I kind of get lost easily.)  I found this on google maps, is it the right place??   Thanks!!  Has anyone been there this week? How was the fishing??  "
142332,Hellfish,2007-12-13 17:14:00,308,"fishing has been great, 10ft vis as of yesterday so the fishing will slow abit now fish will get a lil spooky just means u have to try different things so the ifsh tell u what they want. I think live minnows or streamers or imitations would work really good right now."
142350,aniceguy,2007-12-13 18:35:00,1094,"Niagara parkway to Dumfries stay south and you ll see the entrance to the launch, roads getting rougher each yr but no biggie, bring some salt and sand, usually someone leaves a bag but always good.  When I go I usually will carry a small pail of salt and sand mixed dust it before I go in and when I pull my boat out...  10 feet of vis just means a longer floro leader, off the 3 way, and I usually up size my slinkie to 1 1/4 with the three way 18"" off bottom  a few extra floaters in the roe bag   get off at stanley, turn left then at the stop sign right and that gets you to the turn on the niagara parkway, turn left follow the sign to queenston  Hope it helps good luck, was hoping to get on it this weekend but seems the flu everyone has and I have been avoinding has finally found me"

142379,Guest Fishing For Life,2007-12-13 21:46:00,0,would you use bottom-bouncing or float fishing?
142385,irishfield,2007-12-13 22:12:00,26272,I think Lyra is going on a charter! Just needs to get to the pick point...
142387,blizzcat,2007-12-13 22:22:00,92, yep! I'm going on a charter with Fishmaster. It's actually a present for my boyfriend but I'm excited because I've never caught a big fish before! (I'm a small trout kinda gal) haha  But all your tips may still be useful as we may stay and fish off the dock after the charter.  Do I have the right map by the way?
142388,RickyD,2007-12-13 22:39:00,10,Fishing is primo at Queenston right now. This was a few hours there this morning....
