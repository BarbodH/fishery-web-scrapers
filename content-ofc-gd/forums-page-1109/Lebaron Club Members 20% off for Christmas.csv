That's a great deal on stuff that is already lower priced than most other stores!!   This deal is also available to people that buy a membership same day."

I am thinking about getting myself a better Columnbia jacket ... maybe the Titanium series which is supposed to be windproof, light, thin and warm  any recommendations?"
142569,kennyman,2007-12-14 15:48:00,737,"It is a great deal, although there is no percentage off on sale or ""special"". Sometimes that's to THEIR benefit. For example I'm looking at a Scientific Anglers flyfishing kit. Now it's $124 in the book regular price. So do the math. Take 20% off and that's $99.20. They put it on ""SPECIAL"" for $109, so no deal. Isn't that ""SPECIAL""? The stuff you don't want to discount 20% ,put on sale for 10% off (or so). Although I think Irishfield (sorry if it wasn't you) posted that they ship out of Quebec so no PST as well, so that should basically pay for shipping. It's still a good deal, just a little sneaky."

They are Canadian, and I try to shop Canadian as much as possible (even thought it's hard to find stuff they sell made in Canada).  So I buy tackle, rods, reels, electronics, clothing, camping gear etc.  I just bought a Canada Goose parka (only 10% off) but still a good $100 cheaper than every other Canada Goose dealer I checked out for the same parka."
