142246,misfish,2007-12-13 10:38:00,29133,"Did anyone catch the guy on the the news last night. He was on Little lake here and there was 8 inches of ice on it.He was saying how dangerous it was out there and the sleders were crazy for being out there. 8 INCHES.  Why the news lets people like that on tv, I,ll never know.   Maybe he didnt want anyone else on the lake so he could catch all the snot rockets himself."
