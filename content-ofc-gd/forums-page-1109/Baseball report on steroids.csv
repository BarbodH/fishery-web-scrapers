142372,KyleM,2007-12-13 20:58:00,218,"This was the biggest waste of money Ive ever seen.  Where are they sitting now?   I dont understand why people are angry, it was common knowledge that most of these guys were pumping this crap into their body.  Its more political Bull than anything, its hurting the game more then helping it!  Everyone knows they need regular testing, it has been suggested for YEARS.  This just confirms what everyone already knows."
