369013,Rich,2009-08-02 22:15:00,3927,"Took my neice Katie and my nephew Isaiah out to a local pond for a couple hours today to get some fish. Both the kids had a blast playing with the sunfish and although he wouldn't hold it for a picture Isaiah also caught his first largemouth.  By the end of the trip Isaiah was the only one that didn't want to leave.. but I heard ""one more fish"" too many times.. food called to me. lol  Good times with family.      "
