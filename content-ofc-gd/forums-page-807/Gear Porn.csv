(you can google the Shimano and Tuna Stick for current prices!)    ... now what were you saying aboot your little minnow catching rod and reel????
368672,archie_james_c,2009-08-01 04:17:00,618,    Tuna and bass....do you fish for anything challenging?  
368675,Greencoachdog,2009-08-01 04:37:00,8163,"  Do you mean like using whole/live 24"" Wall-ice for...    ...Blue Catfish bait??? "
368676,archie_james_c,2009-08-01 04:44:00,618," Hey if I fished for Bass all 80 years of my life like you did, I'd accidentally catch a few Walldo's like that.   ...Blue Catfish bait???  Catfish, Tuna, and bass...WOW  ."

368932,Rich,2009-08-02 14:33:00,3927,"You spent too much on the gear, to catch the fish.. that you are unable to fish..  Ain't that the truth about fishin!"
369027,archie_james_c,2009-08-02 22:43:00,618,"  You hit the nail on the head on that one Rich! Worst was ...my buddy stops over to the house for a visit and says ""Hey lets go to the tackle shop and do some window shopping."" I say ""NO!...I'll friggin buy something..."", ""Ah no you won't don't worry I won't let you.""....we get there and he says ""Hey look Arch theres that reel you wanted...OH and its in the size you wanted too!!!""......   What are friends for   LOL."
369043,Greencoachdog,2009-08-02 23:35:00,8163,"  That's the good thing aboot being 80, you have 100 times more stuff than you'll ever need and 10 times more than you'll ever use!!!   Ahhh! To be young and stupid again, like....  "

369068,Dara,2009-08-03 02:04:00,3052,A guy in Oakville made the saw set for me  
369095,Greencoachdog,2009-08-03 03:58:00,8163,  Chisels and backsaws for what???... are you going to run some molding in yer boat???
369216,archie_james_c,2009-08-03 19:51:00,618,  You should sell some of that gear and raise funds for a sweater from this decade pops   .    Slick set Dara...but did the guy have to stuff all his junk wood strips in the box?
368175,archie_james_c,2009-07-30 23:06:00,618,"Well guys after just dropping 170$ on my new Daiwa Tierra 2000 today and still owing dough on my boat, I don't think I'll be fishing for a week or so...so instead of a report I figured I'd give some of the gear-heads on the site some gear porn to creep on   . If you guys wanna add to the thread with your new ""had to have purchases"" then join in!  You're seeing a St.Croix Mojo Bass Medium Light X-Fast 6'9"" with a Daiwa Tierra 2000 size strapped to it...been using the rod for some time now for walleye and bass, just picked the reel up today...thinking of spooling up some high-vis yellow Power Pro 10lb   .   "
368177,ohhenrygsr,2009-07-30 23:07:00,947,sorry but this thread is useless without a CenterFold please
368180,archie_james_c,2009-07-30 23:14:00,618,?????  
368182,Rich Clemens,2009-07-30 23:16:00,3131,Nice boots
368184,Greencoachdog,2009-07-30 23:22:00,8163,"  Dude!... don't look now, but somebody has stolen most of the cork off of your handle!!!    Now that's my kinda ""live bait""!!!"
368185,archie_james_c,2009-07-30 23:25:00,618,   You gotta be stylin' to catch Wally's   .
368260,chinookhunter,2009-07-31 02:20:00,68,the handle is used to drop shot lures
368263,splashhopper,2009-07-31 02:22:00,2931,"but is she a ""catch and release"" though "
368265,archie_james_c,2009-07-31 02:26:00,618,"   Correction, the handle is used to make me look super cool while fishing  ."
368269,bassjnkie,2009-07-31 02:29:00,1101,"Archie, your going to love that Tierra. They cast like a dream, with a wicked smooth drag. I use 2 for carp and never failed me."
368278,archie_james_c,2009-07-31 02:36:00,618,"  Well knowing that they're tested ""Carp Tough"" is good enough for me, as all I'll be doing is winching in lazy Walleye   .  How long have you been using them for?"
368281,bassjnkie,2009-07-31 02:44:00,1101,"2 of them I've been using 1.5 years and the 2 for carp a little over a year. They are great little reels. The drag knob can be finicky though when taking them off and putting it back on, But it's a minor issue."
368282,archie_james_c,2009-07-31 02:46:00,618,  Yah I noticed that right away they have that rubber grommet to keep water out...just gotta be careful thats all. What size tierras are you running for carp (and your other setups for that matter   )what line???  Speak!!! I am a sponge...bringeth the knowledge.
368285,Greencoachdog,2009-07-31 02:48:00,8163,  btw... your Diawa Tierra 2000 would have to stand on it's Momma's shoulders to be able to reach up high enough to kiss my Shimano's 1500 Stradic's   ... and that would be one of the Diawa's finer points!!!
368286,archie_james_c,2009-07-31 02:49:00,618,  Hey...don't you have some sort of cousin kissing contest to attend?  ***banjo playing in background***
368310,Greencoachdog,2009-07-31 03:43:00,8163,"  My sister, my wife... my sister, my wife....................   ... how much corn squeezin's is left in the jug paw-paw??"
368323,archie_james_c,2009-07-31 04:28:00,618,  You got any gear porn?
368339,mbac31,2009-07-31 10:13:00,904,Please dont ask GCD for gear porn. You eyes wont handle what he will post.
368341,bassjnkie,2009-07-31 10:30:00,1101," 3000's with 8Lb Siglon for float/match fishing, but I will be down grading the size to the 2500's soon. The nice thing about the reels is the body is small, which in turn make them light."
368424,Jet,2009-07-31 14:34:00,364,Nice reel man. Keep an eye on the pin in the handle to see if it starts to slide out. I had the same one and the pin was the only thing that didn't perform as advertised.
368436,GBW,2009-07-31 15:07:00,8460,"ummm, miss.  you some how hooked yourself.  please let me help you take that off and remove the hook..."
368467,largefish,2009-07-31 16:13:00,35," How do you have the heart to put it on the ground? LOL You need to wrap it in a blanket. What's up with these rods that don't have the whole handle corked, but just a part of it? Is the economy that bad that they're saving on cork?  Or, it makes the rod lighter, but then again cork is a pretty light material?"
368566,archie_james_c,2009-07-31 20:20:00,618," Thanks alot I'll keep an eye on it.   You gotta lay the reel **gently** on the ground   . And no...the only reason this type of handle was invented was to make me look cool on the water...because we all know, if you don't look cool you ain't catching fish. The same rules apply for hunting..."
368592,Bondar,2009-07-31 21:20:00,817,got her in the mail yesterday Quantum PT 20 Tour Edition picked it up on ebay for $104.25 WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO    much better looking reel than last years  blue tour editions  IMO   Oh and i've also had the problem with the pin in the reel handle of my tierra 2500 coming loose and near falling out so i peened the end with a punch and hammer
368599,archie_james_c,2009-07-31 21:40:00,618,  See now this is what I'm talking about guys its gear porn for us poor buggers that can't be fishing right now!!! Lets see your latest and greatest...you too GCD you toothless hillbilly!  Wiser that units got quite the heavy duty bail system on it.
