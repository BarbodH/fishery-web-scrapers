369552,Jigger,2009-08-04 22:04:00,1237,Nice fat fish! Seems like this has been a great year for the guys fishing trophy waters. Some real big fish landed this year already.
369575,Syn,2009-08-04 23:10:00,519,"To supplement the first picture I found this info on another fishing forum with the same woman and her muskie.  ""This is one of the biggest muskies ever caught by a woman, 56 x 25 and weighed at 48 pounds casting a Boo Dadley. My friends Dave and Amber Smith from Kentucky started fishing yesterday morning for about five minutes and this was Amber's first musky and it turned out to be the fish of a lifetime.  If any of you have a chance to fish with my friend Johnny Dadson on Georgian Bay this is what you might find. In late Fall this would be a mid 50 pound musky."""
368959,Johnny Dadson,2009-08-02 17:11:00,7,What did you do with your first 5 minutes on Georgian Bay?        Johnny Dadson www.johnnydadson.com
