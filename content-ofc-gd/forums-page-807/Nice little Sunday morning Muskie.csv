Not the biggest I've ever caught, but it was nice just to hold her in my arms and then see her swim off again to grow bigger!!    The Release............  "

Roy, it's nice to be out and about again!!...it's been busy around the house and at work but I'm finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel  .....I start vacation for 4 weeks starting August 14th and I'm going to make sure I make up for all the lost time!!"
369116,Roy,2009-08-03 10:50:00,13728," ""Busy"" isn't a bad thing. It makes you really appreciate any down time you can find. You have a great four weeks....when you deserve it, it's much easier to take.  I have one week left right now but it's one of those years where things are a little more difficult than normal. You have a great time during your holidays!"
