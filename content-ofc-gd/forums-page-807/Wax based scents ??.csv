368409,Alumacraft,2009-07-31 13:46:00,139,Has anyone tried the wax based scents ? I was thinking of giving them a try. I've beening catching alot of smallies on jerkbaits on Erie and the Upper Niagara but still getting lots of follows that will not commit. I was hoping that by adding the scent might get a few more in the boat. I was interested in the wax based scent as I would think it would not wash off after one or two casts.  I found this one    http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/descpage-BWPS.html  Anyone ever try this one or if you've tried any other brand I would like too here any comments good or bad.  Thanks Rob

368732,Terry,2009-08-01 15:13:00,14456,never seen it before
368733,bassjnkie,2009-08-01 15:16:00,1101,"Never seen that, I love the mega strike though."
368736,Fishnwire,2009-08-01 15:50:00,983,"I do like scent-infused soft plastic...but have tried various spray-on or squeeze-bottle scents over the years, and never found that they're worth the time, hassle or expense.  I have never tried the wax kind, but I have to wonder...considering wax is not water-soluable, how is the scent being dispersed?"
368746,bassjnkie,2009-08-01 17:17:00,1101,"I really doesn't make sense to me. If you take a hallow ball of wax, and fill the void with scent, put it under water, would the scent be able to get out?"
368753,EC1,2009-08-01 18:55:00,930,"These scents are just probably to make the fish hold on for longer. Not sure how effective these ones are, but would like to hear more about them!"
368762,grinandbearit30,2009-08-01 19:38:00,50,"As far as I am aware, scent is a function of decay...meaning, whatever smells leaves a little bit of itself behind as it trails through the water...I don't see wax having a significant enough decay rate to be..uhm..stinky."
368836,camillj,2009-08-02 00:22:00,1988,Take a tiny piece of fresh worm and put it on the hook ... scent does matter .. and if you're not in a tournament (where it may not be permitted) .. just adding a little 'meat' can make all the difference .... if scent is the differentiator...  It sure does when we are fishing for specks ... like 100% difference ...
369311,Alumacraft,2009-08-04 03:30:00,139,Thanks for the replies guys I was wondering some of the same things that were mentioned. I might order 1 and give it a try on those days were I'm getting lots of follows from the smallies.  Thanks Rob
