368406,jpmclean,2009-07-31 13:41:00,9,Mostly smallies - typically you'll hit bass and trout there especially in teh smaller pools near Petro Canada Park.  If you feel like wandering upstream you might find a few better pools.  If you're fishing near the bridge its hit and miss really some days i see people there for hours not even getting a bite.    Worms work well in the deeper stream there otherwise i just use top baits around the reeds and such.    I was thinking of heading up to Milton to hit up Kelso if you are interested in tagging along give me a shout
368415,craigdritchie,2009-07-31 14:02:00,1586,"Upstream of Lowville there are resident browns and brookies. Most are six to eight inches or so. It's mainly private property, so you'll need to knock on a few doors to get access.  Between Lowville and the lake you'll find smallmouth bass (most are pretty small, but there are occasional monsters up to a pound or so lurking in deeper holes), some rock bass, plus various chubs, shiners, suckers and the occasional small carp. You may also find a few smolt steelhead that still haven't figured out which way the lake is. The marshy area just above the harbour has a handful of small pike, sheephead, largemouth, bullheads and crappies. Try casting small Mepps spinners and you'll catch some fish.  In the summer months, Bronte Creek is not exactly a hotbed of fishing activity. The rainy summer has resulted in better water flow this year than normal, but it's still a shallow, warm ditch that's full of silt. It's perfect habitat for chubs, marginal for most other species.  The lake is generally a better option. There are some nice smallmouth on either side of the rivermouth, as well as sheephead, large carp and channel cats. Get down there very early in the day and try casting Shad Raps or smoke-coloured grubs. Small tubes under a slip float are another option."

368433,eze76,2009-07-31 15:04:00,70,"Thanks alot guys,  ill post a report,  if i dont forget my camera i always do lol"
368438,Marko,2009-07-31 15:17:00,854,In about a months time salmon should start showing up in small numbers. The only other fish that i`ve seen there were bass and carp other then salmon and bows.
369178,rbaquial,2009-08-03 17:24:00,968,Great read!  Thanks for posting that topic Eze!  Can't wait for my next outing to Bronte!
369179,Rich,2009-08-03 17:31:00,3927,Does nobody get decent perch from the mouth area there?
369180,rbaquial,2009-08-03 17:32:00,968,I've only been out there once - I need to make it a regular trip though!  Awesome place to go.... especially with family.
369272,SBCregal,2009-08-04 00:58:00,688,"Rich  theres lots of perch down there, i havent caught anything over 10"" with most in the 6-8"" range"
369281,rbaquial,2009-08-04 01:27:00,968," Worms? Minnows? or Artificial plastics? ... What would be your recommendation? and... on a float? (if so, how deep?) or off bottom? THANKS IN ADVANCE!  You know what... scratch that. I didn't ask - better to just try everything there myself!"
369289,SBCregal,2009-08-04 02:12:00,688,"i got them on worms, under a float...depth varied until they start biting too close to the bottom and you're gonna be getting a ton of goby i got most perch in the outer harbour area off of the pier"
369347,eze76,2009-08-04 11:36:00,70,"Np A2F lol,  I didnt end up going , i was busy , but when i do go ill make a report"
369353,Rich,2009-08-04 12:10:00,3927,"What we use on the piers 'round here is a pickerel rig with 2 live minnows. Seems to always nail the perch (and ya never know what else). For some reason I have a memory of going to Bronte pier and doing this a couple times as well, and getting a bunch of big perch."
369364,Mike Pike,2009-08-04 12:51:00,1332,"The pickerel rig is the easiest way to get the minnows a foot or so off the bottom, keeping it infront of the perch and out of the reach of gobies( for the most part ).  I find it way easier than trying to estimate where the bait is sitting using a float, especially in deeper water like Bronte Haroubr."
