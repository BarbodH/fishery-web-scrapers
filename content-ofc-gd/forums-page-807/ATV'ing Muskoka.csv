Some friends of mine and I want to head up in a couple weekends and do some trail riding. One of my friends lives in Coldwater and I know he says that although there are a ton of trails, the cops are always set up looking for guys on ATVs running municipal roads.  Even if only to cross from one trail to another on the other side of the road, this is illegal.  We want to avoid this and thus are looking for information on Muskoka trails. We have no issue with paying a day rate to use the trails, but we have little to no information on what is actually available.  Are there any guys on here that ride and have some information they could share?  Just looking for general trail maps, costs, and over all information about the quality of the trails they know.  We dont really want to take the hike over into Haliburton, so any information shared would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!  Ab"
