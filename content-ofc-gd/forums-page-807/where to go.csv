I was wondering if anyone could recommend a lake in driving distance to Lake Muskoka that is good for Bass.  Somedays we get 10 to 12 Bass on Muskoka, somdays we get skunked.  Any recommendations would be appreciated - ie   Nippissing, Manitoulin, Georgian Bay.  Kids love bass fishing, but days we get skunked are no fun, Thanks..."

I fished Lake Muskoka alot as a kid and there are plenty o Bass as well as monster Pike in there (not to mention Lakers). I think rather than finding a different lake, you need to find some different techniques for when the fish aren't co-operating. Part of the sport is finding the fish when they aren'y finding you. Try learning about jigging, drop shotting, tubes, Senkos, trolling. There are many different techniques you can try to produce fish.  Thats my $.02"
