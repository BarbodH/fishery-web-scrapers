AWESOME post btw  As some of you know, I have just started top-water fishing about 4 weeks ago... what a ""blast""..  Here are some of the results over the last 5-6 days .   a ""head shot""... amazing how much weeds I can see between its mouth and the gill plate   Fishing the lily pads... first cast about 10 feet from shore... WHAMMO! on my newest colour of :scum frog""!   Check out the size of his bucket >   Went out tonight on my ""practice pond"" and had a very pleasant surprise.  The guy who owns the house that I park in front of brought his canoe down tonight and asked if I wanted to join him  Turns out he has watched me fish this top water stuff for a few days from his yard and was ""impressed""... yeah, I told him.. I have some ""great coaches"" from this site  He toured me around the edges where I fish from shore to give me another ""point of view""... Interesting that I was fishing the same spots as he was showing me, but I was targeting the water further off shore than I needed too  my first cast in ""to"" the spot I always take my first cast of the day ""from"",,,, and surprise... Kapow!   This one I caught after I pulled the frog down from a tree ON the bank... it barely hit the water and BAM !   I gave him my favourite colour of ""Scum frog"" for his ""guide service"".   I have been trying to set up a trade for my services for a tinny or a canoe with an Electric motor.... tonight just makes me that more focused on that little project...lol  Splashhopper"
