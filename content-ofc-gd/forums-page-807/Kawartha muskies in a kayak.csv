I knew I wouldn't get out as much as I would like with weather conditions and family funtime coming first.  I did manage a total of 10hrs fishing for musky at a decent spot 1km away from the beach over 5 trips in the kayak. I caught two and had six other lazy followers during those outings.  This first one was caught July 20th on a Mepps musky killer bucktail. I hooked it in 10ft of water with scattered weed growth on a windless morning around 10am. It measured 38.5"" and by the time I landed it there were 3 other boats around me watching.  The spectators were all delighted when it took off giving me a good soaking.  The second fish was 33"" and was caught on July 23rd on the same bucktail about 50yds from the first. This time it was pouring rain with a 15km/h east wind. I got to try out my battery powered bilge pumps and after 2 hours of pouring rain they emptied my yak in under 4minutes. I also borrowed a GPS unit and found I can troll for 30minutes at an average speed of 3.7km/h and I hit a top speed of 7km/h during a sprint on flat water.  We had a rental boat and as a family caught many panfish, small bass and even a few walleye casting a drifting jigs. My daughter was proud to lip her own fish before releasing them."

369134,michaelkovacs,2009-08-03 13:51:00,48,"Well done!!!  I was thinking of picking up a canoe to go on the back of my tent trailer when I head up to Algonquin, but wasn't sure I could keep the thing steady while fishing.  Maybe a kayak is a good way to go...  congrats!"
369136,tbayboy,2009-08-03 14:03:00,1497,Nice fish Jedi - that must have been a load of fun.
369145,Victor,2009-08-03 15:18:00,1609,"Those are some nice looking skis. Is that 38.5"" the lucky one to be the first ski on your new yak?"

369156,jediangler,2009-08-03 15:54:00,1923,"Well Victor, I caught a couple of under 30"" musky on the opener in the new yak but didn't take any pics. It is the first legal sized fish from the Tegris and second biggest yak musky to date for me."
