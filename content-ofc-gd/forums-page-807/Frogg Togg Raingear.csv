369020,Canuck2fan,2009-08-02 22:29:00,1444,I have a set of fogg toggs that I bought off of ebay and they are great. Paper thin litterally and 100% waterproof and surprisingly wind proof as well. They are breathable too which is another plus. I have had them for over a year and worn them many times. I spent about 12 nights pier fishing in June and July this year and wore them each time just to keep the dew from soaking me. Other guys were either freezing or clammy from wearing PVC rain gear. I was pretty comfortable given the conditions.

369121,blaque,2009-08-03 12:01:00,2419,frogg toggs are pretty popular down here in the states...............theyve even found there way onto the golf course.
369146,grt1,2009-08-03 15:27:00,638,I got a set' when I bought a minn kota motor as a promotional item. I've had them for 5 years and they are pretty well worn out but they are great. I am definately buying another pair next year. For the price they have served me well and I picked up a set for the wife last year. I got mine at cabelas for the wife.
