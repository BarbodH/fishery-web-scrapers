Went strait out to deeper water, marked lots of fish near bottom in 65' all we could catch was Sheephead. Heard Steve(Fishmaster) on the radio catching. So we trolled west to 80'. By the time we got there Steve  was leaving with all the fish    He said they shut down. So we trolled the area till 6:00pm and left. We did manage 1 Walleye and a surprise, a nice Coho. The Coho hit a worm Harness on a Deep Driver, back 150', 2 1/2 setting, Speed 2.0. "
