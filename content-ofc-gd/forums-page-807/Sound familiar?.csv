""It's just disgusting,"" said Darrell Crabbe, executive director of the Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation.   In the 4:40-long video -- which was first uploaded Thursday before it was taken down then re-posted by someone else -- the driver of a Hyundai Tiburon is seen shooting ducks on a small pond with an air gun before it cuts to two men standing outside the car, this time armed with a .22 rifle.   While their aim isn't always accurate, the pair manages to hit several ducks -- laughing and cheering each time -- while a third man films.   Based on the background and lack of a front licence plate, Crabbe said it's likely the video was made in southwestern Saskatchewan or southeastern Alberta.   ""There's a field of canola there and we just don't have that many places that grow that kind of canola,"" he said.   ""It's turning so it narrows it down.""   One man is referred to as Dave in the video, while the other is called Jer. Both white and appearing to be in their 20s, the driver is seen wearing a grey shirt and orange shorts, while the second man is wearing a red shirt and dark pants.   The videographer also turns the camera toward himself at one point, revealing he's wearing a black hat and has a goatee.   ""The enforcement guys are going through the whole video with the forensic guys,"" he said.   ""We got a couple pictures that are just crystal clear so we're going to post those and send them through our e-mail contacts, which is about 4,000 people in Saskatchewan.   ""I wouldn't doubt if these guys have a knock at their door within a week.""   With no ducks in season in Canada until Sept. 1, Crabbe said the trio could be facing charges ranging from careless use of a firearm to poaching   Call the Saskatchewan Environment Ministry tip line at 1-800-667-7561 if you can help.

Who wants to bet they get off with a slap on the wrist?...........that's if they even catch them!  S."
