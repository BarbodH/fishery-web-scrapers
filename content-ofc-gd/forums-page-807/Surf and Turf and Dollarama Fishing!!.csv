We saved so much money buying Carling and our tackle at Dollarama we splurged on some great food!!  First off our Dollarama Derby Pictures.  I caught two bass and Monique caught a small pike.  I made a leader out of the wire we bought, but without a swivel, my line got pretty twisted which lead to an early end to the fishing.  Ill have to find real leaders at a  Dollarama somewhere.  Our Tackle Plate    First off here's my shining moments on FILM!!!    and the epic smallie battle!      Here's the pictures for the derby... We got three on and landed all three!!              Then of course Monique had to out do me and catch this monster!!! (Shes such a meanie!!)      So.. my entries... a total of 25 1/2 inches amd Moniques whopper - 10 1/2 inches.  All fish live released!!!  That night we went out pickeral fishing in front of the camp, caught two small ones for breakfast the next day and I snapped this shot.  I hope my wife doesn't find out about me new girlfriend!!    We also managed to drag the boat UP the rapids north of camp, Monique had never been there... We went till we saw another boat.. then returned home.    Here's some other pictures from the weekend.. I love going up just the two of us, when we can take our time and prepare an awesome dinner.  Night #1 - Crab Legs, Garlic Butter Fried Scallops, Jumbo Shrimp and Cheese and Spinach filled Ravioli in a Tomato Cheese sauce.    Night Two was prime rib, stuffed portobella mushrooms (PS.. note to self.. dont wait till 10:30 to eat... uhhg...)    and then wings on night three.. lol..  i was in too much of a hurry to take pictures...  We did wake up to a VERY large bees nest under the eave of the camp, here's me about to do battle....    As always a great trip, not a lot of wild life this time, most of the ducks have gone early it seems.  We did do a bunch of small jobs around camp.   till next time!!"
