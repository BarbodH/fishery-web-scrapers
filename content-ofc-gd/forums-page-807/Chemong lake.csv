We have a trailer on Chemong lake,  and as we've never actually been on the lake before, I was hoping some of you could point us in the right direction, our first outing will be with my daughter, so I'm hoping she catches the fishing bug too.  I don't need your hotspots, as I expect to find our own sooner or later, just a general idea of where would be a good place to start. Not picky about what we catch, just want to get my daughter ""hooked""  PM me if you like, any advice would be greatly appreciated.  cheers Sully"
