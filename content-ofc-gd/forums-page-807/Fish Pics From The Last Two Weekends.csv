369010,Leecher,2009-08-02 22:08:00,7832,Busy couple of weekends tnt Some real beauties in there for sure!!! Thanks for sharing Leechman
369046,misfish,2009-08-02 23:44:00,29133,"Rob,right ? Been awhile. Nice report and catch."
369051,dave524,2009-08-03 00:03:00,4508,Nice going Do I see an Atlantic in there??
369055,tnt,2009-08-03 00:19:00,63,"Yeah misfish, yeah it has been a while.  Finally back home and able to get out fishing.  It'd be great to get out a bit more but with the new house and the terrible weather. sort of cutting into my time on the water.  Oh, yeah, it's Todd  I believe it's a small chinny but I may be mistaken."
369058,misfish,2009-08-03 00:35:00,29133,"Sry Todd.LOL  It does look like an atlantic,or a brown.Forsure not a chinny."
369062,tnt,2009-08-03 00:43:00,63,"LOL....yeah actually I'm not sure what I was thinking.  When we got it, we though it was a bow but didn't really take that close of a look.  Just unhook, quick pic and back in.  I think it's probably a brown, I remember it doing a ton of head shaking during the fight."
369264,dave524,2009-08-03 23:56:00,4508,"Surprised no one else has weighed in with an opinion, remember a recent Atlantic ID ?? generated a substantial thread . I would still lean to Atlantic looking at the shape, relatively few spots on the gill cover and a slight fork in the tail."
369265,TJQ,2009-08-04 00:00:00,7806,"Nice Todd, good to see you back in action!"
369268,Pigeontroller,2009-08-04 00:33:00,2793,The gentleman in pics #2 and #5 is a good looking fellow!
369271,Fish Farmer,2009-08-04 00:57:00,2234,"Yes that is an Atlantic 100% 9th picture, wish there were more out there. The young lady has a Rainbow."
369316,Alumacraft,2009-08-04 03:39:00,139,The guy in pics #2 and #5 needs too smile and actually look like he might be having some fun catching some nice fish for once (HEHE) LOL
369320,MuskyBill,2009-08-04 04:59:00,311,"Good shootin', Todd, & Dax too!  Good to see Dad in action too..."
369325,Rich,2009-08-04 05:17:00,3927,Good stuff!
369492,tnt,2009-08-04 19:01:00,63,LOL at Dax.  Well I've never caught been in the boat when an Atlantic was caught so that is a first
369498,misfish,2009-08-04 19:23:00,29133,"  Square tail tells me it,s a brown generously proportioned.  AH?????   s quare    tail"
