399127,Steve Piggott,2009-11-03 22:49:00,196,"Nice fish ,I will have to get up there for those big fish next fall. I have been busy fishing for the trout on the lower Niagara.  "

398676,trapshooter,2009-11-02 18:15:00,1234,"Over the last few weeks I've had some friends come up to fish Muskies with me on Lac Seul.  The guys who came in late september had summer weather and we were raising and catching all our muskies casting bucktails, jerkbaits and topwater.  The October trip was the opposite... cold, windy and snow.  We still raised 2 muskies casting and one hit on the f8 but came unpinned.  We trolled a lot more and that's how we put the fish in the boat.  This fish hit a cowgirl at boatside and launched 3' into the air before a quick net job.  That'll get your heart pumping!      A few more for my buddies.  First muskies ever for these two.      Cory gets one after losing a good fish the day before.    My wife came out for a day hooked up while we were trolling.... she though it was going to be a muskie but turned out to be a decent pike.    This is how the fall trip looked for a lot of the time we were out there.    The boys still got some fish though.  Jakes and Grandma's are good baits to troll up here in the fall.            I'm trying to get out again before ice up gets here but deer hunting is getting in the way.    Ben"
398680,troutologist,2009-11-02 18:36:00,951,Nice fish Ben. Those were the characters I was looking for!  I recongnize some of those spots too! Very cool lake you get to call home. I'll be back next summer or this winter.
398682,anders,2009-11-02 18:38:00,1168,those are some thick fish!!
398688,yakpiker,2009-11-02 19:15:00,160,Wow...I think a fishing cabin in north-west Ontario needs to be added to my retirement plan.  Those are some beautiful fish...congrats!
398692,Fishing 24/7,2009-11-02 19:24:00,709,HOLY COW GIRL!  dude those are some sweet healthy pike you have up there!  SIC!
398695,lew,2009-11-02 19:39:00,12766,"Great stuff Ben, alot of nice fish there !!  That's a tough job you've got up there, but I spose somebody has to do it."
398698,fishindude,2009-11-02 19:44:00,220,"Sweet ski's you got there! Congrats on a job well done! What speeds were these fish caught at?  Thanks for the pics, fishindude"
398700,Roy,2009-11-02 19:47:00,13728,"Just fantastic, Ben! I don't see any disease marks on any fish from Seul that have been posted here. Is there less occurrence of disease in muskies caught in that area as opposed to other places do you know?  Great report thanks."
398705,trapshooter,2009-11-02 19:57:00,1234,"   Thanks guys.  I feel truly lucky to live and work on lac seul.... all of these fish were just 'pleasure' trips though, with friends.  We're trolling between 1.7-3mph this time of year.   These fish are pretty clean, Roy.  You do get some with net rash and split fins, etc.  though.  They just seem like big, healthy muskies in this lake, from what I've seen.  Other then that, I don't have any scientific info wrt disease to back it up with.  I think their size and quality appearance has a lot to do with the size (large) of Lac Seul and lower angling pressure then other water bodies.  It's not necessarily a N. Ontario thing either.... lots of places in South and Central Ontario with big, clean muskies.  Not sure if that helps answer your question or not."
398717,Roy,2009-11-02 20:24:00,13728,"Fine answer thanks Ben. No it's just that you'll often see muskies displaying wounds, lymphosarcoma and such and it just occurred to me that I couldn't remember seeing a marked up Seul fish. Thanks again."
398739,TerryC,2009-11-02 21:02:00,196,"Awesome Post, sometimes it hurts having to settle for little Kawartha musky down south.........  Clarence"
398764,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-11-02 22:16:00,0,WOW! Those are some really healthy looking musky. Lac Seul looks like just one of those paradises every fisherman should visit at least once in their lives. Thanks for sharing.
398892,ehg,2009-11-03 02:59:00,2666,That is a lot of nice muskies! Noticed that they were getting fatter in pictures as the season got later. You are lucky to be there
398896,Hooked,2009-11-03 03:12:00,891,"Are you kidding me, haha, each one of them are huge!  Nice going man."
398897,Mike the Pike,2009-11-03 03:12:00,3421,Wow Ben some healthy fish there.  Beautiful Pike too.  Please note my Southern Friend from Bama.Ben captures those fine species using a boat with a Tiller for its main engine

399015,limeyangler,2009-11-03 17:19:00,5204,"Top stuff as per usual Ben!  Great looking toofy critters!
