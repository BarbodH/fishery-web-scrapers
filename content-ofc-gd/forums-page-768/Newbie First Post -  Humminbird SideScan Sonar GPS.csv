399275,Trooper,2009-11-04 12:28:00,2,"Hi everyone, I've been following the discussions and reports, I'd just like to say great job everyone.  I'm looking for a new Fishfinder with the GPS and the SideScan Sonar. In particular I've honed in on the Humminbird 798.  Does anyone in the group have one? Is it best to get the model with the built in GPS or with the external GPS antenna?  Thanks,"
399337,John,2009-11-04 15:16:00,2956,"Hi Trooper, welcome aboard. Tell us more......  I have a Humminbird 9 series but didn't get the SideScan. I am quite impressed with mine. I would suggest you do a comparison study Humminbird vs Lowrance and decide for yourself. Go to a dealer where they are powered up and you can at least run through the demo and play around for a while. You may like the features of one vs the other.  Absolutely go with the external GPS antenna."
399453,Trooper,2009-11-04 21:34:00,2,"Thanks for the reply John.  If I'm not mistaken Lowrance is or has just recently come out with a side scan unit.  I kinda like the smaller Humminbird style of unit being it will fit on the dash a little neater.  As far as the Side Scan, although it's more money, I think it will be a really worthwhile feature to have.  I think you're right about demoing the unit, I'll definitely go that route before making the purchase."
399466,Terry,2009-11-04 22:11:00,14456,"I don't own one but I have been watching them Humminbird  has had sidescan for a while now and with the last couple of software updates, seem to be real stable  I really like what I am seeing with the lowrance but it is unproven and still not available, (they are still saying but the end of the year)   so Humminbird is the only game in town and I don't think you can go wrong with them....  myself I will wait till lowrance has been out for a while then I will decide which is right for me"
399468,LucG,2009-11-04 22:14:00,779,I've never owned a GPS so I can't help you there. But welcome to the board. Alot of great people here.  Luc
