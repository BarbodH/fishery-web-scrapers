399331,crappieperchhunter,2009-11-04 15:05:00,2582, Yep. What the man said. You broke the law. You got busted. Suck it up buttercup.
399342,I'mHooked,2009-11-04 15:24:00,525," I've got no problem with 120 (in a 100  ). But to play the other side, What would that driver who is doing the LIMIT consider all those other drivers zipping past them ? A hazard maybe? If 15 cars doing 120 see 1 car at 100 as a hazard, then that same car at 100 probably sees 15 hazards around him. Just because the majority are doing something they are not supposed to, doesn't mean the person following the rules should be made to feel uncomfortable doing it!"
399359,solopaddler,2009-11-04 16:18:00,8605,"For those that read this board it's obvious Ryan is a good man. To top it off he seems to have a great wife and a very young, very lovely daughter. As is the case with most young families I'm fairly sure money is tight. Yes he was caught speeding. Would any of the judgemental types begrudge the man his right to attempt to get the charge knocked down? Never mind the fine itself but the jump in insurance might be a lot for a young family to handle. Do you think maybe he might slow down a bit in the future now? So many people so quick to jump. My guess is you'd best be careful casting stones as you most likely live in a glass house."
399366,Spiel,2009-11-04 16:46:00,9065,You've likely got all the help you need here Ryan and then some. Good luck.
399177,fishing n autograph,2009-11-04 01:14:00,2540, hate to break it to you but 41 over the speed limit is 4 demerit points

399185,danc,2009-11-04 01:48:00,4677,My advice? Don't speed. I've been driving for 35 years and have never had a speeding ticket. Because I don't speed. Works every time.
399187,irishfield,2009-11-04 02:05:00,26272,Yah but the prime fishing is right in your back yard... so you don't need to rush to get there Dan !
399192,fishing n autograph,2009-11-04 02:14:00,2540,I didn't know they had roads where you are Dan!
399193,Jacques,2009-11-04 02:14:00,97,Dan is wise.  Most of us are family men.  Most of us drive on less-travelled highways where speed can become a deadly issue.  Stop thinking of what we can get away with and start thinking of what keeps our families safe.  Pay the fine and drive responsibly.
399200,irishfield,2009-11-04 02:26:00,26272,"Speed wouldn't be an issue in this country if people actually drove properly and we all followed proper protocol with merging, lane changes etc. No passing on the right etc.  Wales/England.. 50 MPH is the limit ON WINDING SINGLE LANE HEDGE ROW LINED goat trails. 70 MPH is a suggestion on the M4/ M5.. other than the video speed traps that are all in the GPS data base that beeps at you when entering. Traffic on the multilane flows lovely... everyone in the slow lane.. out to pass and back in. No weaving.. or slow folks in the rail lane etc. Saw very few damaged cars over there. Picked up in Manchester by my brother's buddies wife. On the M5 and I glanced at her speedo of her Nissan SUV and thought to myself.. we're going along pretty good for 88  ! Then I saw the MPH in big letters.. KPH in small !   The norm and a non-issue over there."
399201,Raf,2009-11-04 02:28:00,3495,"not 'speeding' may be well and good in north west boemfook but on the hwys around the gta, you become a hazard not going with the flow. imo."

399209,danc,2009-11-04 02:51:00,4677," Yet another reason that I'm glad that I don't live there. I don't know how often you've driven the highways in ""west boemfook"" Raf, but it ain't like cruising along the 401 by any stretch of the imagination. People choose to drive well above the speed limit here too. I don't. Highway deaths are almost a daily occurrence up here between Sault Saint Marie and Kenora. Some are caused by driver error, others by road conditions. I don't want to be one of those stats. So I play by the rules. I remember when the ban on cell phone talking came into effect and you slammed that as well. Apparently you are well versed on multi tasking. Lord hope that I never meet up with you while driving on a black ice glazed stretch of highway on a downhill curve while you're talking on your cell phone, and the only exit is Lake Superior, 400 or 500  feet below. Less the cell phone possibility, there's plenty of places that meet those requirements in ""west boemfook"". Let me know if you're coming up this way and I'll do my best to stay off the roads for the duration."
399259,Chris,2009-11-04 11:24:00,405, Great advice
399264,Jer,2009-11-04 11:42:00,1426,"  Is this fairly new? It used to be 9 points for an interview and 15 for an automatic suspension.  When I was young and foolish and only had my license for a year or two, I managed to ring up 10 demerit points in a short period of time. I received an invite to see the JP to explain why I should not have my license suspended. From the time I received the letter til the the date of my appointment, I managed another 3 point ticket (total of 13 now). At my interview with the JP, he asked if I had anymore tickets. I was honest with him and I think that was the only thing that saved my license at the time. 15 points was an automatic suspension.  I'm older and drive much more responsibly now."
399265,Daplumma,2009-11-04 12:00:00,1961,Am I missing something here?You were speeding..You got caught...Man up and do your time.What ever happened to personal resposibility?
399268,Whitespinnerbait,2009-11-04 12:03:00,2038,  Here Here ....  How do plead '' Not Guilty '' to getting caught speeding an admitting to it ....
399274,pikehunter,2009-11-04 12:24:00,1659,"Figure out how many times you drive in any given week, how many times you've driven above the posted limit and how many times you have exceeded the limit by a huge amount and take another look at your ticket.You will soon see you got off easy.  We all speed, all of us, even those who don't admit it. It's only a matter of time before you get nabbed and you have to pay for your own stupidity. That said do what you can to preserve your points as it's a small step to the next time you get hit and loose a couple more, then look out. Been there, done that got the T-shirt to prove it. I try to be smart about speeding but I'm usually running late when heading to work and push my luck a little too far, if I don't smarten' up I too will be in your position once again."
399277,Fisherman,2009-11-04 12:32:00,7201,"Sometimes I wonder when people get caught doing something wrong, they have to wizz and moan about it and hope that the rest provide sympathy for them.  Drive within the rules, don't attract attention to yourself and it's unlikely you'll ever meet the bear on unfriendly terms."
399285,solopaddler,2009-11-04 13:27:00,8605,"Wow, the self righteousness is literally oozing from some of you guys.  Go to court and get it knocked down Ryan."
399289,cuzza,2009-11-04 13:34:00,467," Sounds like the UK has changed completely since I left in July!!!! You had a very good exeprience of the roads over there.  88 on the motorways will land you a ticket sooner or later, anything over 80 is asking for trouble - that's not to say that people don't habitually do it, just like going 120 over here but the majority of drivers have points in the UK, so much so that insurers don't even worry about the first 3.  Speed limit on single lane roads is 60mph but it's reduced to 40 or 50 even in the middle of no-where ""for safety"". There are speed traps (un-manned photo radar sites) all over the place and not just the ones marked on the GPS, the police don't even have to stop you they take a reading and a photo and send you the ticket in the mail, if you weren't driving, you have to name the driver, if you can't remember who was driving the owner of the vehicle gets the points.  Everywhere you go on the motorways there are people driving at or just below the limit in the centre lanes with nothing inside them - overtaking on the inside is illegal but it still happens, the problem being that no-one expects it (because it's illegal) so it leads to some nasty accidents.  You don't see many damaged cars because all vehicles have an annual safety test and a smashed light or even a blown bulb is an automatic fail.  You're right about the weaving, some of the stuff I've seen on the 401 in particular is unbelievable! The other thing is cutting people up - every morning I sit at a light 200m from the highway on-ramp in the right-hand lane of a three lane road and I know that all the cars in the middle lane want to take the ramp but they don't want to queue up and as soon as the light goes green they just drive at a gap between cars  Anyway enough of my ranting - did you get any fishing in???"
399292,Raf,2009-11-04 13:43:00,3495,"tell ya what danc, since you like clouding issues not to mention getting personal  the self righteous down here in southern ontario keep their opinions re: scheduling hunts out of the north and the self righteous from the north don't tell us how to drive.  the 401 is NOT hwy 17/11.  common sense tells us to drive according to conditions, an icy road means we slow down.  a dry, sunny day means the average speed of people travelling on the 401 is 120.  that's just the way it is.  if you're going the limit, you're a hazard.  if you must know, i've been driving for nearly 20 years.  not a single accident where i was at fault (been rear-ended).  i think i am a pretty safe driver.  you can come out of your cave next time i'm up in NW boemfook."

398614,The Urban Fisherman,2009-11-02 14:56:00,2050,"Hey guys - sorry bout the NF thread.... I know we have a few officers on here.  Short version - I was in a bit of a hurry to get 3 hours away from my house for a quick shoot for work, then make the 3 hour drive back home before Averie blew out her candles for her third birthday.  I MADE IT, but was burnt for speeding on the 407!  The officer was a cool guy, told me to keep it around 120 and I'd be ok. lol I was driving the same speed as everybody around me, but he said they picked me out of the crowd because I have a bright yellow SUV... lol  Anyways, he told me to take it to court, and in a year from now he'd ""help me out"" and the ticket would be dropped to 15 over.  I just don't know if I'm supposed to:  a) Plead guilty but appear in court  Plead NOT-guilty and appear in court.  Any help would be great!  Thanks OFC!  Cheers, Ryan"
398626,I'mHooked,2009-11-02 15:23:00,525,"No option for ""got caught speeding, pay the fine, great learning experience!"""
398631,FLEX ROD,2009-11-02 15:46:00,394,"Plead not guilty, as the court does not have the right to lower points as the MTO sets the points and once you plead guilty they can only plaay with the fine portion.  FLEX"
398639,Governator,2009-11-02 15:59:00,879,"I got a court date next Tuesday for fighting one.  Always plead not guilty, I don't care about the $100 but I don't want to lose 3 demerit pts and the only way to get em is to fight for them.  There's also a chance the cop won't show.  In that event case dismissed (I'm crossing my fingers lol)."
398647,danbouck,2009-11-02 16:46:00,4380,"by him saying ""I'll help you out"" It probably means that he will not show. Plead not guilty and it will get thrown out"
398655,Fishnwire,2009-11-02 17:11:00,983,"If he wanted to ""help you out"", why didn't he just write you up for 15 over on the spot, instead of making you take a day off of work and deal with the whole hassle of court?  It seems like a waste of your's, his and the court's time to have you show up if you'll end up with 15 over anyway.  If he'd have given you a ticket for 15 over, you'd probably just pay it and that would be that.  Also, you were going with ""the flow of traffic"" and he admitted it.  What can be gained by singling out a driver who is not doing anything out of the ordinary?  Without a doubt, a greater safety hazzard was created by having you pull over to the side of the 407 with high-speed traffic whizzing by, than getting one guy to slow down more than those around him.  If you really were going with the flow of traffic and the cop stated so, plead ""not guilty"", because you didn't do anything wrong.  Any judge with half a brain will see this.  Good luck."
398657,SBCregal,2009-11-02 17:14:00,688,seeing a cop with someone pulled over for speeding has always gotten me to check my speed and slow down a bit if doing over 120.
398662,The Urban Fisherman,2009-11-02 17:32:00,2050," Sorry, not the option that I'm interested in....  I don't blame a cop for pulling me over, they're just doing their job and I have a huge amount of respect for them - but the fact of the matter is, he told me to do this, and if it's going to help me save a few bucks on the ticket, as well as on insurance then I'm taking it to court.  Learning experience, you bet - he told me if I keep it under 120, I'm good to go - which is normally the fastest I drive, so no worries here.  Cheers, Ryan"
398664,The Urban Fisherman,2009-11-02 17:38:00,2050," cool - thanks.   Good Luck - my fine was $265.00 my wife wasn't to stoked about that... thus taking  it to court.   yepp - time will tell I guess..   He said I was lazered so he couldn't take it off himself, so to take it to court and he'd help me out..."
398669,Cookslav,2009-11-02 17:55:00,1457," I Agree with this statement, Just cross your fingers and hope the officer doesn't forget about your conversation. But then again...even if he does forget the deal, its not as if you have anything to loose at this point by pleading not guilty right"
398671,cuzza,2009-11-02 17:59:00,467,"I can't see how pleading not guilty, going to court and effectively admitting your guilt by saying you were ""going with the traffic"" is going to help you get a reduced fine (as a minimum you'll end up woth court costs etc. on top if you're found guilty, won't you??), nor can I see how the officer in question is going to 'help you out' now he's written the ticket for over 120, he's not going to admit any possible inaccuracies in their readings and it's part of his job to go to court when he's written the ticket, so I wouldn't bank on him not showing up although I guess he may have decided to quit so knows he won't be around in 12 months?????  I don't like your chances but good luck!"
398674,BillM,2009-11-02 18:09:00,17367,"  Uh, the Crown will plead the ticket down to probably 15 over and no points.  If the officer has no objections (this is what the officer was talking about)  ALWAYS take your tickets to court...."
398677,ecmilley,2009-11-02 18:20:00,2163,"take the ticket in, see the crown they will many times drop it to 15 over right then and there and send you the bill in the mail, beats waiting for court and taking your chances."
398681,Governator,2009-11-02 18:37:00,879,"  Yea that's pretty high, it's because on the highway you were obviously movin' pretty fast.  Mine was a stinkin' 103 in an 80 on hwy 11 and wouldn't lower it to 15 over.  Mind you I've been in your position as well with a $285 one for 93 in a 60 through collingwood and it gone thrown out because the cop didn't file the ticket lol."
398685,Fish4Eyes,2009-11-02 18:49:00,1022,"Take it to court, but I wouldn't expect the points to go away unless the officer does not show up. They will lower your fine only. It is a possibility for the officer to lose his notes too."
398697,cuzza,2009-11-02 19:43:00,467, What a terribly nice system - you get a lower fine and no points by going to court to argue about it!!!  My only knowledge of speeding tickets is from the uk where you get 3 points and £60 as standard and if you take it to court and lose you still get the 3 points but you get a £1000 fine for your trouble too   I assumed that taking it court for the sake of it would be treated the same here - another plus point for Canada!!!
398707,BillM,2009-11-02 20:02:00,17367, Be glad we don't live in the UK
398710,fishinfool,2009-11-02 20:07:00,366,"Correct me if i'm wrong but I think that demerit points are added onto your license not taken away and when you reach 9 you get a written warning. At 15 you have to go and see someone who will whack your pee pee hard! Also, if the cop gave out a bunch of tickets that same day, he has to show up to court to be present for all those tickets. The chances of him not showing nowadays is pretty slim. IMHO I don't go any more than 20 over and haven't had a ticket in 15 years. (touch wood) Good Luck all the same."
398740,bubbles,2009-11-02 21:02:00,591,"  That may be a bit of a stretch, so you can speed as along as you can find a few buddies to speed with you......... I would like to be in court that day to witness that defense!  Take it to court, if the ticket is more than twice what you make in a day (silly to go for $10, and they will not make it go away totally) then always take it to court.  As others have said the crown WILL plead it down for you.  THEN - set the cruise at 119!"
398744,Governator,2009-11-02 21:15:00,879,"Also keep in mind if you plead not guilty your record stays clean until after the court hearing.  So if you screw up badly, renew insurance prior to lol."
