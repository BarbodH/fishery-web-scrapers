397653,Leecher,2009-10-30 00:45:00,7832,"Here's a little video I want to share with you before I'm off on the hunt for deer.  I know you've seen those before but the 2008 - 2009 season was a blessing for me..... wasn't able to go out as much but got to be thankful for times I was able to.  Special thanks goes out to my friend Paul for getting me into some of the best fish I've ever experienced.  Last year I got into quantity but this year was about quality, from first to PB's..... got to love that.  All this to say that it was a phenomenal season for me and I'm thankful for that.  Now I know that for some of you guys the steel season is just beginning and want to say GOOD LUCK to all of you on your quest for them beauties.  That includes the musky hunters.... keep it up guys, love your reports!!!  As for the hunters going into a new riffle season, be safe, shoot straight and best of luck.  I won't be online for some time cause out in the bush.... no service provider but will report back in mid November with maybe a another report of sort     Got to go pack now and get ready!!!  Hope you enjoy Leechman  "

398306,MCTFisher9120,2009-11-01 13:56:00,3761," wow, It was a chunky fish. My largemouth I caught on my Grandmas lake was 21"" on the nose but it was a skinny fish, 14"" girth I think it was.  Just shows what a few more inches can do to weight 4lb 10oz vs 5lb 6oz....Perhaps I should go at the end of August next year lol"

399298,Leecher,2009-11-04 13:58:00,7832, Thanks Grant!!!  Hunting video Hmmmmmm.... it's doable but would require a camera man while the action is unfolding.... Instead I'll try and get some footage of the area I'm hunting.  Going back tomorrow morning
