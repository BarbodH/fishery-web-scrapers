399284,yakpiker,2009-11-04 13:25:00,160,Very entertaining...thanks for sharing!  Are you using some type of hands-free camera for the video footage?

Got to love spending a couple of hours on shore and getting into quality fish like that  Quite a bit of snow you got up there.... is this normal for this time of year?? I guess it won't be long now before we get to see a hard water report from you LOL Keep up the good work and thanks for sharing Jacques

399489,johnnyb,2009-11-04 23:04:00,3413,DOOOD!  Sometimes I think it would be wrong for me to catch a walleye until I get the chance to do it with you   But then I snap out of it    Great vid and pics...thanks for sharing
399651,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-11-05 15:20:00,0,Very entertaining. I'm loving these fishing videos! Thanks for sharing.
399699,basskicker09,2009-11-05 17:56:00,144,nice job loved the short little movie how did you film while fishing?
399944,limeyangler,2009-11-06 07:27:00,5204,"Thanks for all the replies guys, a couple people asked how i shoot the vid clips while fishing, well , its nothing fancy          LOL Spiel, funny the things you notice when reviewing the clips.    Yup a Limey....not Australian!    A change is better than a rest?    I had a dream about icefishing last night...guess i'm really looking forward to it, and yeah..snow is normal this time of year.    JB....get yer family up here,  I aint gonna say it again!"
400010,bubbles,2009-11-06 14:59:00,591,Good on ya mate!
400015,bigugli,2009-11-06 15:24:00,6138,"With an accent like that, I should think so.  Simon certainly doesn't sound like a 'wog'  You sure do have nice water in your backyard. Almost makes me envious."
400092,Greencoachdog,2009-11-06 22:29:00,8163,"Excellent vid Simon!!!  .. but snow on the ground in the first week of November???... do you live at the North Pole?... there was frost on the ground here this morning, but it's 26*C right now!  ... watching your vid with the snow helped cool me off after a hot day of working in the yard.   ... btw, you sounds Australian to me."
