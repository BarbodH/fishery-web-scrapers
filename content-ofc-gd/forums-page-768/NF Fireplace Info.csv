399304,Dara,2009-11-04 14:12:00,3052,Can you use insulated chimney pipe?
399305,JohnF,2009-11-04 14:13:00,3494," I'm not suggesting it's a lost art yet, but there are fewer and fewer woodburners being installed. Some places have even banned them for pollution reasons etc. I suspect there aren't a lot of folks specializing in this kind of work any more. They're all doing gas installs or at best metal fireboxes.  JF"
399312,Dara,2009-11-04 14:20:00,3052," some places have banned them because of sucky neighbors complaining.  I heat with wood now, and my next house will have wood as well. Who can afford gas or electric!!"
399317,GBW,2009-11-04 14:28:00,8460,"I would love to get a wood burning stove in my house now but I've got to wait for the kids to get a bit older for safety reasons... I wish I had pic's of the old house basement to show you the work my father and uncle did, it was amazing!  If I remember this weekend...I'll take pic's of the work they did at my folks current house/cottage..."
399319,Dara,2009-11-04 14:31:00,3052,  My daughter was 3 and my son was 6 months old when I got my house with a wood burning stove.  I built a little picket fence around it to keep them away.
399322,irishfield,2009-11-04 14:36:00,26272,Yep..like Dara. The kids aren't as dumb as you think. We had a door flapper franklin when the first two kids were under 2 and a few weeks old and have had them ever since. It's like the stove in the kitchen.. teach them to stay away from it. Kitchen stove is probably more dangerous than a fireplace or woodstove.

399360,Dara,2009-11-04 16:21:00,3052,"  Hence the fence. I wasn't taking any chances of the dog knocking them into it either. It was just a little picket fence made from 1x2 pine, varnished up to look nice, and removable so I could get to it for emptying ashes and such"
399372,GBW,2009-11-04 16:59:00,8460,"FLEX, do you want me to ask my uncle who is a brick layer?   Ahh, I see.  Good idea.  I still have a year to wait as this is a new house so I don't want to finish the basement 100% yet.  But thanks (no intent to hijack the thread either)."

399563,Cookslav,2009-11-05 03:41:00,1457,"Do you have a chimeny already in place then? Reading your post seems to suggest you have a gas ""insert"" installed into a pre-existing wood burning fireplace mantel? If that is the case your situation might be a bit complicated depending on where the gas has been vented... I'm not sure you can even do that by Code?"
