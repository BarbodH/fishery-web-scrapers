She was slowly dying from kidney failure and the last two weeks, walking around like a bit of a drunken sailor, sometimes missing the jump onto the sofa or a step on the stairway.  By 5pm tonight, she had that look in her eyes..I'm ready to go, please take me to the vet.  Called the vet, 6pm appointment, he agreed, no needless suffering.  Ten minutes later, 2 needles, one long last look, she faded away.  Mostly a house cat, only allowed out on a leash, she never annoyed anyone around the neighbourhood, most didn't even know we had one.  Apart from loosing some dear friends, animals can sure wring your heartstrings when it's time to go."
399841,douG,2009-11-06 00:42:00,2693,"Fisherman, you did the last best thing for that family member, a tough job that no one else could do.  Well done.  18 1/2 years is astounding.  That's a long time."
399842,irishfield,2009-11-06 00:42:00,26272,Feel for ya fella.. know that feeling all toooo well !
399844,JPD,2009-11-06 00:46:00,296,I know exactly where you're coming from right now... we put our 13 year old Springer Spaniel down one month ago today. Never an easy decision to make but you absolutely did the right thing.  JP
399846,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-11-06 00:53:00,1107,It is very hard to lose a pet and even harder to make the decision to put one down .Sorry for your loss
399850,rbaquial,2009-11-06 00:56:00,968,I'm sorry to hear... 18.5yrs is a pretty long time...Sorry for your loss!
399858,Daplumma,2009-11-06 01:15:00,1961,"Sorry for your loss,thats a long happy life for an animal.My boy is some where around 13 or so.I found hime in the road eating road kill in 1997.He was full grown then.Here is a pic from a few years ago.  Joe"
399860,timmeh,2009-11-06 01:19:00,609,"Losing a pet can be tough, put the old dog down a couple years back, was not easy but for the best. At least at 18.5 years she had a long, happy life."
399868,thalweg,2009-11-06 01:54:00,112,Fished with my dog basically his entire life until it was time to go.  He was the best fish'n partner I ever had.  Sure is a tough period to go through.
399876,Mike the Pike,2009-11-06 02:23:00,3421,Very hard for you after all those yrs we have a 16 yr old cat who love very much.  Sorry for your loss!!  I came home tonight from a 2 day road trip and my kids have been feeding a young stray kitten at our door step.  Wish I could keep the young tabby but our old girl will not accept any new cats in our house.  MTP

399938,limeyangler,2009-11-06 06:55:00,5204,"I feel for ya dude, never an easy thing."
399945,Fishnwire,2009-11-06 07:37:00,983,"I just lost a 10 year old male orange tabby a couple months back.  Went through the same exact thing as you.  It sucks, no doubt about it.  An Ofner (I wish I could remember who) said something that really made a lot of sense to me back then.  Having to take your pet into the vet to be put down is a heart-wrenching thing to do, but is really the final act of kindness that you can do for the little fur-ball.  I'm sure you spoiled your cat and gave him a good life.  If he was anything like mine, his last few days were one of the few times in his life when he experienced pain or even discomfort of any kind...they have it pretty good.  My wife and I just brought home a three year old male grey tabby from Pet Save about 10 days ago.  He still spends most of his time in a closet but has started to explore the apartment a little bit and is quite affectionate if you approach him slowly so he doesn't bolt.  The thing is that despite how you feel right now, and even though you can never replace a pet, the time may come when you're ready to let another little pain in the butt into your home and your life."
399949,Jer,2009-11-06 11:12:00,1426,I hope all is well with your family.  I'm dreading the day as well. My 12 1/2 year old sheppard mix is really starting to decline quickly. A little bit stumbly and off-balance sometimes. I don't know how the winter is going to be for him.  Here's a pic in healthier times:  
400041,Squid,2009-11-06 17:28:00,1656,  yeah mine is there too. Feel for you.
400103,Fisherman,2009-11-06 23:57:00,7201,"I must express my heartfelt thanks for the many kind posts to ease the pain.  This afternoon with the help of my oldest son, she was laid to a final resting place. "
