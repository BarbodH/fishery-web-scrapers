398402,Fishing 24/7,2009-11-01 23:16:00,709,"Well i was blessed to spend this week end with my brother!  I planned the fishing trip to a small private pike and small mouth lake.  Untouched PARADICE!  We start the day @ 10 pm.  light winds sunny skies.  second or thrid cast of the day my brother hooks into his first small mouth of the day.    Then its my turn i hit a rocky point that drop form 5 Fow to 15-20 FOW.  i cast a 1 1/2 onze spinnerbait and tip PIG of a bronzeback want into the action!    Jason (brother) cast's back into his hole and he hits another nice FOOTBALL  ONE SMALLIE TWO SMALLIES??!?!?!    The bass were feeding for winter hitting heavy lures.  BIG spinnerbaits the type you use for 10 + pike.    almost dosent fit in there mouth but they manedge two swallow the darn thing!  Small mouth were slowing down and im wondering why!  NO WONDER!  we get to a tall salad bar and there he was roaming the erea.       my brother got this amazing action shot of the pike WIPPING its tail to escape my perfect release shot!    The bite was on and off all day.  my brother missed a bass on a white big-o that would traumatize some anglers.  i know i am .  i think i wont sleep tonight after seeing that PIG! must have been a 20 "" plus easy.  at around 3 pm the bass were slowing down to a point were you had to work you    to get only one.    They were all worth it dont get me wrong.  but we decided to leave.   5 houres of fishing.   20 + smallmouth   3 pikes including one for super.  EXELENT day on the water."
398414,Greencoachdog,2009-11-01 23:30:00,8163,"Oh man!!! I see the family resemblance!!!... you Bubba could be a ""Mini Me""!!!... and if those fish were any heavier, y'all would fall flat on your faces from holding them out so far!!!  ... but they are all beauty fish and there's nothing better than spending quality time with family!!!  Excellent report, pics, and fish Kevin!!!  Thanks for taking the time to post!!!"

398437,Radnine,2009-11-02 00:07:00,1538,"What a fantastic report!! I mean it, wow. It is reports like this that make me wish that my brother wasn't such a tool (actually he is a good guy that would probably like me to call him up and take him fishing. Hey, wait a tick, maybe it's me that is the tool. Man, I hate this report) Jim PS. WHAT A PIKE!!!!"

398691,Fishing 24/7,2009-11-02 19:20:00,709, sadly my cousin borrowed my scale.  but that bass is in the 4 lbs range.  no fish over 5 were caught that day.  i saw so many 4 + come out of that lake it dosent make SENSE!
