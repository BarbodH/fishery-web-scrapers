Got my my homework done susprisingly early lol and as i close my books my phone rings... My buddy Wes calls and asks if i want to hit up the rapids! of course! he pics me up and i guess he was already down there today for a bit and already got one steelie! so my hope were high!  get down to our drift and as were walking out to it he says ""are you gona drift roe?"" i looked at my float rod and said ""i might try tossing spoons for a bit"" Good call! lol  one cast in nothing lol, second cast i slow it down a bit and it just stops dead! i set the hook and feel some headshakes! FISH ON lol so Wes comes over to watch and record some video. Then it goes for its first run! wow peeled off so much line i thought i was gona get spooled! it jumps a few times and then it starts commin in. A few minutes go by i still dont know what it is forsure. we were thinkin a freshish chinnook... but then i saw a flash of pink and i knew it was gonna be my biggest steelhead from the rapids! a few mis-attempts at tailing the fish and then my friend got her!   32-33 inches and 9-10 lbs i was stoked!   same fish   and agian  she swam away nice and strong!  Then my buddy put on a clinc!  He got 2 on roe with in 5 drifts!   a nice male!   and agian!   and here is his second fish!  Then as he is relasing one of his i get one on, while drifting roe.. Lmao! ... but i lose it while trying to land it doh!  but not 2 drifts later my float goes down agian! lol after a nice fight with plenty of jumps!  as my buddy was trying to land this one it decided to swim bettween his legs and get really wraped up lol as i tailed her she snaped off haha   and he she is agian!  So to day was an unexpected fishin trip but well worth it! in the end we went 5/6 on the steelhead and also landed a coho!  Great 2 hours!! hahaha  Thanks for reading!"
