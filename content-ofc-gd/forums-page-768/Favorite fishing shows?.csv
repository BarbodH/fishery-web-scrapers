395809,ehg,2009-10-23 17:15:00,2666,"Likewise, haven't watched a fishing show for 10 yrs. but mainly because the children like watching other things.  Pete Bowman was pretty good on Fishin' Canada, learned quite a bit from his shows on local waters.  Nowadays youtube has plenty of video which fills the need, here is some OFNers... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i5_DGf6DRU...feature=related "
395817,Beans,2009-10-23 18:10:00,3339,"One show I liked way back when (the name escapes me)...the host usually fished around the New England states...usually had a well known guest...and was the first host to introduce the ""flying lure""...Anyone ???  BTW...he usually fished out of a small punt...no flashy bass boats..."
395819,Roy,2009-10-23 18:27:00,13728," Norm, wasn't that Rod and Reel Streamside that Holdfast mentioned back on page one?  edit: No, couldn't be that one...the one Holdfast mentioned was with Bill Saif out of New York...Henderson Harbour I think."

Fishing The North...................Don Mark  How 'bout the old""Fish On"" on TVOntario...always ended with a fast forward ""fly tie""  For now I enjoy Dave's antics and like to get Schooled by JP....   also really like the Next Bite gotta love Pete!   Fish'n Canada is a staple on my plate... very educational and informative   I'm not too fussy 'bout the ""Gettin ' There "" part of the show though.... goes against my better judgment.   RFS "
396352,holdfast,2009-10-26 03:00:00,1813,"Roy your right the first time, I believe Beans is talking about ROD AND REEL STREAMSIDE with Don Meisner who did Local shows.  Bill Saif was THE ROD AND REEL.  I never liked the guy, he would make fun of his Canadian Guides, especially the French and Native guides.  For all its worth, a buddy of mine said his dad seen him jigging Salmon out of the Black River in order to do a show."
396354,holdfast,2009-10-26 03:03:00,1813," Yea, I used to drive my Wife nuts, Yelling  FISH ON whenever watching the show."
399171,ryantyler,2009-11-04 00:58:00,2,"Anyone else enjoy Hooked with Mark Krupa.  He was a lil crazy but the places he fished were absolutely incredible,  I dream of being able to fish those places.  Wish they did another season.  For the most part though I grew up watching Chronzey's and Bob's shows religiously."
399184,vinnimon,2009-11-04 01:48:00,2593,"I grew up watching red with my dad and uncle,at that time they didnt understand english very well.But we all enjoyed his show after fishing.I was the translater.I met Izumi a few times,he was too busy.and Italo, seen him too many times in the niagara area ,I didnt know If I was going to be baby talked(I let my kids watch his show though, it informs them, so they can understand).cronzie I like.but all in all reds my favorite.cheers to you red."
399189,danc,2009-11-04 02:09:00,4677,  You sure that wasn't Red and Gordie Howe??
399190,Lunkerhunter,2009-11-04 02:10:00,455,fishful thinking is pretty good.  i also enjoy fishncanada and musky hunter.  next bite is also another good one.  bell also has wfn and i also agree the pvr is amazing.  one thing i hate about wfn is that they always play sooo many repeats.  cheers
399194,vinnimon,2009-11-04 02:15:00,2593,"does anyone know how that idiot was that used to fish off of a ladder for bass, and always fell off when he had one on?It was funny for a while."
399196,danc,2009-11-04 02:21:00,4677," Marks are about the only shows that I watch these days, and in high def to boot. I can, and do, watch them over and over again. He's simply an entertainer. Most shows try to shove knowledge down your throat. Stuff we've heard a million times before. I just want the hosts to take me fishing with them. Not to tell me how to catch post spawn Walleye, how to tie your lure onto your line, and how to fillet a fish. Boring.... Show me some nice scenery, some decent fish, and keep me entertained. That's what I want out of a fishing show."
399215,Dabluz,2009-11-04 03:08:00,701,"I always enjoy watching FishfulThinking and Bob Izumi.  But, I have been reading just about all there is in fishing magazines, books, catalogs since I was about 12 years old.  Add to that the fact that I have been fishing for close to 60 years....year round, worked as a conservation officer and biologist in a ZEC here in Quebec and spent a lot of time with fishing associations and federations.  But most of all....I've never had the budget to buy lots of equipment or often go to places where the fishing is easy.  The only time I have ever fished at an outfitter was last spring.  A buddy needed some people to make a fishing film.  I got my first boat (12 foot aluminum) 2 years ago.  I still do not have a gas engine.  I've had a canoe for about 30 years now.  So, you can see that fishing has not been easy....at least high quality fishing.  This meant that I had to learn how to catch fish that had already been fished and in places close to civilization.  I've never used a downrigger or a side planer.....you need a boat for those things...lol.  However, I do a lot of finesse fishing.  2 to 4 lb test mono is the norm."
395395,ehg,2009-10-22 14:05:00,2666,"I remember as a child seeing the Red Fisher show and it was OK but can't really remember any of it now. Then came along Bob Izumi and that was pretty good since he mostly did Ontario locations. But back 15yrs. ago or so i saw a show called ""Simply Fishing"" where i guy was fishing for muskies on topwaters, or big lakers or pike. Even though it was in locations i never would go to the fish were spectacular!  Here is some links i found on youtube, he is still at it...     My favorite type of fishing here, very nice stuff!"
395403,basskicker09,2009-10-22 14:28:00,144,they play his shows on wfn i enjoy them except he always fishes way up north at fancy lodges that not to many people can afford just my two cents
395407,PikeMolester,2009-10-22 14:36:00,428,i want WFN so badly
395409,basskicker09,2009-10-22 14:39:00,144,ya its great except lately i cant seem to catch any of the canadian shows due to work so all i get to watch is fly fishing or salt water the scheduling is so confusing sometimes
395410,GBW,2009-10-22 14:43:00,8460,Where is Dave and JP?
395422,MJL,2009-10-22 15:17:00,2427,"When I was a kid and I couldn’t get out on the weekend, I’d wake up at 6:30am to watch: In-Fisherman, Fishin’ Canada, Canadian Sports-fishing, Real Fishing, Going Fishing, Bill Dance, Roland martin + more till lunch time.  Also enjoyed the odd episode of FishTV with Leo and Steve and really like Shaun Rickard’s urban outdoor adventure.  I used to tape shows if they were about carp or steelhead.  I was a huge Italo and Henry fan back in the day because they fished for so many different species in different ways…Then they hit up Bronte and the Trent…  I stopped watching fishing shows now…a lot of material seems rehashed from season to season and even episode to episode…How many different ways can Italo catch BOQ walleye using tail-dancers or Chronzey catching northern walleye using Gulp minnows on jig heads?  For me I’m more interested in learning new stuff to try out in my own fishing.  I don't have WFN and haven't seen Dave Mercer's or JP's shows but they sound really informative.  Might buy the DVD's when/if they ever come out."
395423,PikeMolester,2009-10-22 15:22:00,428,thats what HD PVR is for...can u evn get WFN with bell?
395424,DRIFTER_016,2009-10-22 15:24:00,10439,"I started out in the 70's watching the Red Fisher Show. It ruined me for life!!!!!!! As no one in my family fishes but me, good old Red was my Saturday morning mentor in all things fishing when I was a younun'. I remeber vividly Red and Bobby Hull fishing at Plummers Lodge on Great Bear Lake. I said to myself that I was going to fish there someday, I think I was 12 or 13 at the time. Well, in 1991 I fished there. In 1995 I went and worked as a guide at one of Plummers other lodges on the lake and have been going there almost yearly ever since!!!! Thanks Red, I owe you one!!!! I would still rather watch his shows more than a lot of the shows produced now."
395427,DRIFTER_016,2009-10-22 15:29:00,10439,  Yep. I have never ordered it 'cause every time I look to see what's on it's BASS fishing!!!!! There ain't a bloody bass within a 1000 km of me!!!!!! I try to watch it when they have their free preview but can't handle watching bass fishing. Sorry if I offended any of you bass fishers. P.S. I have a crap load of bass fishing stuff from my days in Ontario if any one is looking to buy some.
395564,Musky or Specks,2009-10-22 23:13:00,2710,I dont know the name of the show caught it a couple of times on CBC News channel. Its a BBC production and its flyfishing oriented. It was a pretty cool couple of shows that I saw. One was trying to find trout in the Thames watershed and another was flyfishing for trout in Burma and India.
395579,fishinguypat,2009-10-22 23:37:00,547,"i think italo labignan on Canadian-sportfishing is my all time favourite fishing host and show... he took the time to show how to rig for bass ,pike,salmon,steelhead,browns etc...and he even shows where it can be bought and the packaging...even though he doesn't always stay within places that are close he does say the name of the rivers even on ontario tribs. he catches them and tells you how to adjust to get the fish on your trips.My personal favourite show...well fishing show at least"
395585,kentooley,2009-10-22 23:49:00,208,"My favourite episode of any fishing show was when"" Red"" hung the rod above the fireplace and said he was done.  Skutlebut lodge taught me more than anyone can imagine. Bob Izumi is the man. Excuse me while I cry again.  Thanks Red and thank you Bob!!!"
395587,PikeMolester,2009-10-22 23:53:00,428,"yuck I hate Ital...yes hes pretty informative. But he talks to everyone like they are a child with down-syndrome, including his own wife. I miss Bob Isumi from when I was a kid. Now I like watching Fishing the Flat with Paul Waszchuckspelling?) but its all saltwater."
395588,Roy,2009-10-22 23:55:00,13728,"You're right about both those guys, Verminator."
395600,holdfast,2009-10-23 00:15:00,1813,"Same here MJL but Ill nix on buying fishing videos.  Did you ever watch Rod and Reel Streamside?  That was my favorite of all time.  Im sure Roy must of seen it, on Watertown NY PBS"
395621,Fish Farmer,2009-10-23 00:38:00,2234,"Dave Mercer, New style. He brings a lot of fun to the world of fishing. Red and Gadabout Gadies, were the mentors."
395632,bigugli,2009-10-23 00:56:00,6138,"Spent hundreds of 1/2 hours watching Red and his adventures, listening to his poetry. (I've got a signed copy somewheres) That was only on those weekends when we weren't fishing. He taught me a lot in my impressionable youth."
395644,dave524,2009-10-23 01:13:00,4508,"While not an exclusively fishing show, hunting was also featured, the best I remember was the original "" American Sportsman "" with Curt Gowdy. High profile guests  from an age when Hollywood embraced hunting and fishing, most vivid memory was one were Bing Crosby and Phil Harris were bird hunting with comical chat and razzing between them, Robert Stack who was skeet shooting instructor to the stars when he was encouraged to try acting and also sports figures like Ted Williams, probably one of the best flyfisherman that ever lived. Now we got the Hollywood P3TA wackos."
395649,laszlo,2009-10-23 01:21:00,487,like few hate many  must have something to do with really bad guitar solo music in the background.
395679,mojobass,2009-10-23 02:22:00,34,"Seriously I never had WFN and I never touched my TV in my room, but here's a little tip if you guys are with Rogers and want the WFN channel. I own a couple of their services like TV, cellphone, home phone, internet etc. Call in into their customer relations and ask them for the group discount first if you have multiple services by them  Secondly try to negotiate with them for any channel you want to request for. In my case I requested WFN for free because the only way you could have got it was to buy the sport package which cost $7.98. After negotiating with them for a while they finally agreed to give me WFN for free!"
395746,canadadude,2009-10-23 11:58:00,769,"I run into and fish with Italo quite often here in Niagara and he's a super nice guy, very polite, helpfull and a joy to fish beside. I wish more anglers down here were as polite. I'm glad he broke up with that fat ignorant Henry, he's just a clown.  As for my favorite fishing shows, I really like the In-Fisherman and Babe Winkleman was great aswell. Those dudes are way off the radar as far as getting excited and very knowledgable fishers, especially the In-fisherman staff really teach how to get on the right patterns."
395756,Raf,2009-10-23 13:10:00,3495,"growing up, nobody touched the in-fisherman guys.  these days, i haven't watched a fishing show in 10 or more years.  interferes with time on the water."
395757,lew,2009-10-23 13:12:00,12766,Shelly & Courtney are by far the best fishing show hosts on the tube........
