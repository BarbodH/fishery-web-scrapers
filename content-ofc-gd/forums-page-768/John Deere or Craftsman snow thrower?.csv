399583,redneck666,2009-11-05 04:41:00,563,"well i bought myself a brand new 8hp brigs & straton ""snow blower"" last year. first one i've ever owned. starts super easy and even on the first pull.. just started it earlier today after it sitting all summer and she went first pull. so powerful it blows snow into my neighbours driveway which is quite the distance away. never had any problems with it. operates smoothly and easy to maintain and use. lol and it was the last one they had too, some lady was gunna buy it but she didnt call them back in her set time limit so they called me and told me to come pick it up! haha lucky me eh? anyhow good luck with your  ""snow thrower"" search! oh and john deere is very reliable and easy to maintain! that goes for pretty much all of their equipment! good luck! OH AND i almost forgot. the old craftsman arent all that great, i have no clue how the newer ones are though.   JP"

398935,Big Cliff,2009-11-03 10:07:00,6899,"Well, first of all I wouldn't buy a JD, as has been said by others, the quality isn't anything like it use to be. It might say JD on it but it isn't made by them.  Ariens are good units but it is hard to find an authorized warranty depot. Craftsman, Mastercraft, and many of the others have switched to imports in the last two years, I'm not too impressed with the quality of most of them. One of the most important things to consider when buying anything like that is customer service, who will do the warranty if you do need it. Will you have to haul it 50 miles down the road and wait for two weeks to get parts? CTC and most of the others don't do warranty work, you will have to take it to a dealer so why not just go to a dealer in the first place.  When we sell anything, it has been set up, started, tested, and any adjustments needed are done before you ever take it home. We also go over the unit with you so that you know about any safety features and how to get the most out of your unit. In many cases our prices are as good as or lower than the big box stores.  My suggestion; find a local dealer, check out their service shop, see what kind of parts inventory they carry and make sure they can cover any warranty issues."
398941,dave524,2009-11-03 11:05:00,4508,"OK, I just got one as my next one is the big 60. I got a Troybuilt 24"" when they were on sale at CTC back in Sept. I've used some B4 at work clearing around outdoor equipment and a big 80's Toro machine of my Dad's on his long country driveway. It was more than the mastercraft/mtd machines of equal size but had a few features that made me jump up in price. Metal instead of plastic in the 2nd stage impeller, bigger wheels and tires, the control for aiming the chute is a top mounted joystick rather than a crank affair down below, taller chute, heated handgrips?? wonder if they really work, 6 speeds forward and 2 reverse instead of just 1  each direction and the one that I think would make manouvering in tight corners a bit easier is you can disengage the drive to momentarily to each of the wheels independently to reduce turning radius and make tight turns easier. Any farmboy like me who drove tractors in his youth remembers the left and right brake on a tractor and how that works. Troybuilt is a brand that I remember had a very good reputation in the past , think the rear tine tiller I used for the garden plot on the farm was that brand, but may suffer from the same off shore imput that seems so prevalent in recent years. Just another brandname in the mix and a few features to look for."
398949,Fisherman,2009-11-03 12:06:00,7201,"Are the Ariens worth it..well how about 41 years old, 2 mufflers, 1 friction wheel and 3 or 4 drive belts and air for the tires, ya, sounds pretty reliable.  7HP/24"""
398950,SlowPoke,2009-11-03 12:19:00,2984, 41 yrs and you're already putting air in the tires? Try nitrogen.
398959,Chris,2009-11-03 12:48:00,405,"Got to agree the votes for Ariens. My neighbor and I went shopping for snowblowers a few years ago. We checked several brands and after checking everything out we decided the Ariens was the best-built machine. Steel discharge chute, easy to use controls, etc. The Toro came in second. Doug bought the Ariens (it was the last one they had), so I ended up buying a Toro. He hasn't had any problems with his Ariens and my Toro works like a charm too. I would've bought the Ariens if they had another one in stock, but I'm happy so far with the Toro (plus it's a nicer colour haha). I paid around 1500 for mine and I believe Doug paid approx. the same for his Ariens.  My driveway is about 85' x 25' paved and the model I bought was 8hp 28""wide and it takes me about 20mins to clear my driveway.  Good luck with your purchase......"
399042,GBW,2009-11-03 18:20:00,8460,"Thank you all for your feedback!   Ummm Cliff, you still in sales and selling snow throwers?  I'm heading up to four mile lake this weekend from Brooklin so on Sunday on my way home I might be able to swing by for a quick chat...  Let me know, thanks. Geoff"
399047,spooner_jr,2009-11-03 18:32:00,193,"The other thing to consider is the space you'll need to store the thing.  I have a 60"" plow on my atv, but don't like pulling that out every time we get 3-4"", so I picked up a 21"" Toro, single stage.  It takes up about as much room as a push mower, and it's amazing how much snow it will throw.  I've used it when we've had a foot of snow, and it powers right through.  Living in Brooklin, I can't see you needing a big machine for the snow you get, escpecially with the size of the driveways."
399056,GBW,2009-11-03 19:01:00,8460,I had 8' snow banks last year and I spread it out on the front lawn on the one side...     I'm right beside an old farm so it's wide open winds...  As for space in the garage?  I'm not all that worried as we only use one side for a car as the other side is full of kids toys for my kids and my wifes home daycare kids...  Thanks again all.  Geoff
399057,misfish,2009-11-03 19:01:00,29133," And Im even surprised they get snow down there.  If your doing a small drive,dont go gung hoo. Dollar wise.IMO."
399064,GBW,2009-11-03 19:22:00,8460,Aren't you ice fishing yet?
399134,Big Cliff,2009-11-03 23:08:00,6899,"Well, I'm not in sales but the place I work for is. However as I was trying to point out, deal with someone local so you can get service and support if and when you need it. We do support and service our customers but you have to get it to us if there is a problem. As far as dropping in for a chat or a hot one (or a cold one) the door is always open.  As many have said they have older units and are very pleased with them but the unit you buy today from Ariens/JD/or anyone else isn't the same quality as the unit you bought even 10 years ago. Price wars and off shore production have driven prices down but to be able to sell these units they have had to cut the cost of production. The result is a product that is made with the least expensive components.  Would you invest $1000.00 without doing some research on the investment? Probably not so don't go out and spend $1000.00 on a snow blower without doing your homework first.  If you find something that you are interested in, get me all the information (make, modle, price, and name and address of the dealer) and I'll try to help you make an educated decision."
399136,Roy,2009-11-03 23:16:00,13728,You just gotta love that Cliff dude. Certainly in the top 5 most helpful people that I've met in my life and I'm no spring chicken. Thank you Cliff.
399146,GBW,2009-11-03 23:44:00,8460," This is why i came to ask here knowing how many of us here are outdoors folks in different fields.  I'm not one for big box stores because of the service aspect.  I will send you a PM with my email address as I will have my blackberry with me this weekend Cliff.  Send me an email with your address and # and time and I will let you know if I can make it by, cheers.  Well Roy I hope to add him to my list too.  Geoff"
399204,desship,2009-11-04 02:32:00,96,Go to home depot and look at the cub cadet the toro and then the Ariens little bit more bucks but worth it.
399239,GBW,2009-11-04 04:22:00,8460,"I can, but I do not plan on buying from a big box store as the support isn't there.  Ariens has gotten (maybe) the most votes so far, considering I didn't have it short listed it will be now..."
399251,Big Cliff,2009-11-04 08:20:00,6899," Well thanks Roy,   Coming from someone who would do just about anything to help anyone anytime it means a lot! Thank you!"
399272,Greencoachdog,2009-11-04 12:21:00,8163,"I've owned a lot of different power equipment, and have found John Deere to be the most durable and reliable!"
399291,GBW,2009-11-04 13:41:00,8460,yeah but when was the last time you bought a snow thrower....
399449,Dutch,2009-11-04 21:19:00,831,"Sounds like you have a smaller driveway - like mine, and being in Brooklin aren't going to get HUGE snowfalls like they do through Barrie/Orillia.  I would definitley consider a single stage - either Toro, Lawn Boy or Honda.  I got mine just off the 115 on Taunton Road - T&C Small Engine.  Good dealer, although I haven't been back yet - pretty relaible so far.  I have NEVER had a problem with clearing any amount of snow with mine, even wet, heavy stuff AND the plow remnants.  Throw distance is about 20-25 feet, heavier stuff may not go as far.  Good luck with your search."
399542,Rattletrap2,2009-11-05 02:32:00,1652,"GBW, On the larger machines, the features such as being able to disengage one drive wheel really makes turning them easier. Honda makes a nice unit that is ""Trac"" drive. With these, you need to store them on a small dolly to make moving them around the garage easier when not in use. A headlight is also a handy feature. I don't bother with my heated hand grips, but they are there. I like are  having all controls up top where they are easy to operate.  I agree with buying from a local dealer (and have done so with pretty much all my power equipment) but sometimes the dealer goes bust and leaves you high and dry too! This happened with our local Polaris and Ariens dealer ( he was also the JD dealer). I actually did buy my Ariens snowblower from Home depot, but only because the exact model I wanted happened to be on clearance during the ""off"" season and I saved $400 off the previous years prices. I also knew there was going to be an increase when the current years models came out.  Good luck with your choice!"
399551,GBW,2009-11-05 03:01:00,8460,"Thanks guys.  The ""spec"" hunt will start soon to see what I need vs. what is offered as well as a review of all the consumer report web sites.

398686,GBW,2009-11-02 18:49:00,8460,"Hey all.  In need of some help here.  I'm looking at the John Deere 726E and the Craftsman 2-Stage Snowblower with 9.0 ft. of Torque Item #: 711 952 946 10.  These are very close in price so, what makes one better then the other?  What would you buy?  I know ""nothing runs like a deere"" but that's not a valid reason to buy one...  Thanks folks.  Geoff"
398687,HTHM,2009-11-02 19:06:00,4082,"Well, here it is, John Deere is built by a dedicated name brand factory, while the Craftsman are built by the lowest bidder. That being said, JD has gone down in quality IMHO lately. If you can afford it go to the Professional series. PS: I bleed green....."

398714,DRIFTER_016,2009-11-02 20:17:00,10439,"When we moved to Grand Valley in the mid 90's we needed a snowblower being on the edge of the snow belt. We ended up buying a 10 HP 28"" Canadian Tire snowblower. It worked great for us except in times of heavy winds (we were in the open) when the snow would pack as hard as concrete. We would just call the neighbour when that happened and he would pull into the driveway with is John Deere 4 wheel drive 8 wheeled tractor with 8 foot wide double auger blower, took care of the problem in no time. During the 10 years we were living there it got worked hard all winter long. We went through a few sheer bolts on the auger (gravel driveway), a couple of drive belts and a rubber clutch disk. All inexpensive and easy fixes. After break in I used nothing but synthetic oil in the engine and after 10 years of hard use it still starts first pull. A very good deal for the $$$ IMHO."
398726,Lunker777,2009-11-02 20:42:00,866,"All snow blowers nowadays are pretty well created equal. The same components are generally used for multi-ple companies.  Engines especially. They will all break.... ""A machine made by humans FOR humans WILL break !"" The deciding factors should be a little more then the name of the product ! I presume your buying the JD from Home Depot or something. BUT if you have a dealer local.... the John deere blower is what I would go with. Parts and service are readily available.Parts are over night and the shop is right there when need. When you buy a crafstman or murray your buying the product and then have no support afterwards. If you live in an area where is snows regularly... you dont want to be with out the blower for days while the part comes in or while it gets shipped away to be fixed. Also, if you can make it to a dealer, they have 4 more models to choose from..(6 in total ) and they have no payments, no interest for 6 months ! hahah  PS... I work at a John Deere dealer. I sold approx 20 snow blowers last year, and didn't have a problem with one of them !!! This year I have sold around 10... we haven't had any snow yet, so I can't comment on the performance !"
398730,GBW,2009-11-02 20:50:00,8460,"Thanks folks. Lunker777, if I go with a JD it's not going to be from a big box store.  It will be from a dealer because of the support.  I even asked the dealer what used items they had as I know the ones made a few years ago were good units."
398742,I'mHooked,2009-11-02 21:09:00,525,"I picked up a Craftsman 13.5 ft/lb 27"" path blower with power steering last November. It was $1550 reg on for $1050, seemed like a pretty good deal.  It's definitely one of the better investments I've made. I didn't need to use the electric start at all. 1 pull only and it fired up every time all winter.  Did a great job of clearing. With the power steering, it literally turns on a dime without having to horse it around.  We still have to see how it holds up in another 10 years though!"
398748,BillM,2009-11-02 21:37:00,17367,I bought my Ariens from a JD dealership  2 Barrie winters so far and not a single complaint.

398864,Dutch,2009-11-03 01:37:00,831,"Need more info before reccomending anything.  How large is your driveway - gravel or paved?  Reason I ask - do you really need a 2 stage?  I bought a single stage Lawnboy (toro) last year and have never looked back.  It's a 4 stoke, so mixing gas is out, really helpful in the winter, not messing around with the correct mix.  We just have a double driveway, 2 cars deep and paved, so the single stage is perfect.  Never had a problem with plow snow at the end of the driveway either.  All my neighbours have big 2 stage throwers taking up a ton of room in the garage.  It takes them twice the time to do the driveway as they are at the mercy of how slow the blower pulls them and 2 stage throwers leave at least an inch of snow on the driveway depending on how close you set the feet.  You may want to consider a single stage if you haven't researched them yet."
398877,GBW,2009-11-03 02:14:00,8460,"I haven't looked at those Dutch as I didn't think it would do the job.  It's a paved driveway, 2 cars wide and 2 deep.  I get a rather large pile at the bottom from the plow so this is also why I was thinking 2-stage...  So, back to square one, HAHAHA"
398890,Sinker,2009-11-03 02:51:00,8692,"I have a toro too. The thing is bullet proof. It will throw snow out of my driveway, over a 6ft fence into the ditch  I put a belt in it a few years ago. Its gotta be mid 80's model. Just check the oil, fill the gas, and giver'. I've never even changed the plug LOL.    S."
398909,Rattletrap2,2009-11-03 03:55:00,1652,"GBW, It does not sound like you have too large of a driveway to clear, but the things you need to take into consideration are: 1) How long do you expect the machine to last? 2) Will you rely on this machine to get you out of trouble if we get a serious snowfall? 3)How much will your budget allow you to spend on this item? 4) How far do you need to throw the snow?  I too looked at the Murray units at HD and almost bought one back in 2007 when they had them on sale. I have seen these and the CTC units in action and are for the most part cheap crap! I doubt the ones made today will last long at all with their plastic chutes and flimsy parts.  I do live in the snow belt with a large gravel drive. I use an 4x4 ATV with a 60"" plow to clear the bulk of the snow and then use my Ariens 1128 to clean up around the edges and near the house. There is no comparison between the Ariens and the other units I mentioned. If budget is a factor, there are smaller or less expensive Ariens. As far as the John Deere units, I can't comment because I've never looked at them.  I didn't buy because of the name brand. I tried a friends Ariens first and realized that the quality was far above the others. I rely on these machines and need them to last.  Last year, Big Cliff pointed out that Tecumseh had gone out of business and they made the majority of engines such as the ""Snow King"". This is the engine on my Ariens. I believe that parts and support will be around for a very long time with the sheer number of these engines out there.  Anyways, good luck with your research and hopefully you will get what you need at an affordable price!"
