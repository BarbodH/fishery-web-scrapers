Seriously though, the whole roll-out of this vaccine, in most jurisdictions, has been a very disturbing joke.

A clinic in Toronto was selling shots (along with some fitness check) for $2,300...obtained from a private supplier. They may be doing us a favor since those people would have been in line with us."

This will be kept quite http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/stor...103?hub=QPeriod  People are spinning so much its funny, actually hilarious, Yesterday there was a line up 4 hours in the Dark before the clinics opened, today 200 vaccinations all day with an average wait of 30 minutes.

399543,crankbait,2009-11-05 02:33:00,82,"Looks like some people are getting fired over this.  http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/new...ial-flu-vaccine  Alberta Health Official Fired Over Calgary Flames Getting Special Flu Vaccine  Alberta's health board sacked one staffer Wednesday and said more punishment may be on the way for those who let Calgary Flames players, management and family members jump the H1N1 vaccine queue.  ""Like most Albertans, I am deeply offended that this circumstance has occurred,"" Ken Hughes, chairman of Alberta Health Services, said in a news release.  ""The decision to allow preferential access to the Flames and their families was a serious error in judgment.""  Hughes said the ""most senior staff member involved"" was dismissed, but didn't name the person or detail how the Flames were able to avoid long lineups last week and get the vaccination at a separate spot.  The story became public Tuesday, launching a firestorm of criticism toward the Flames and reigniting anger toward Premier Ed Stelmach's government for a vaccination rollout that became so overwhelmed officials shut it down Saturday to reorganize.  Health Minister Ron Liepert said the firing sends the message that favouritism will not be tolerated.  ""Nobody feels good about it,"" said Liepert. ""We wanted to make sure that Alberta Health Services got to the bottom of it. They did, and they did very quickly. I'm sure if they could rewind the clock that all of them would think differently.""  The clinics were overwhelmed when the government urged all Albertans - not just those at high risk, such as young children and pregnant mothers - to get vaccinated.  The clinics are set to re-open Thursday and will only give shots to children between six months and under five years of age, along with pregnant mothers.  Dr. Andre Corriveau, chief medical officer of health, said the province is getting 275,000 doses of vaccine this week, which will have to hold until another shipment next week.  ""We are managing with a very tight supply,"" said Corriveau.  Both he and Gerry Predy, the senior medical officer of health, said when they get a better idea next week on how much vaccine is coming, they can decide whether to expand the shots to other high-risk groups.  ""We will be running these clinics as long as we need to just for these groups to get as many of them done before we move onto the next phase,"" said Predy.  Ken King, president of the Flames, said Tuesday the players and their families received their shots on Friday at a private location.  He said they believed they had gone through proper channels at Alberta Health Services, the agency that administers health services for the province.  Hughes said Wednesday that was correct: ""Flames management made a decision based on information and a process that they believed was approved by AHS (Alberta Health Services).""  King said they felt the shots were a priority for the players because of their extensive cross-border travel and the close-contact physical nature of their sport.  He also said they didn't want to cause a commotion by having the players stand in line at a public clinic. He didn't say why that rationale would apply to Flames management and the families of the players.  The issue raised a larger issue across Canada Wednesday about the nature of celebrity athletes.  Other sports teams, including Edmonton Oilers, Edmonton Eskimos of the CFL and Toronto Raptors of the NBA, have said they did not seek or get preferential H1N1 vaccines for their players.  The Flames players, currently on a road trip in the U.S., had mixed reactions. Captain Jarome Iginla said Tuesday he understood why Albertans would be angry, while defenceman Robyn Regehr said when they got the needles, they didn't know the vaccine was in short supply.  Fans seemed less forgiving.  ""I'd take it personally if it's my son or daughter that died of H1N1 because some elitist scumbag butted in line,"" said an emailer named Jack on the CBC.ca website.  ""Rolling out office flu shots is a good thing, but only offering them to famous millionaires and their families is not,"" added another.  A third said the move smacks of politics for a government that has been hammered in the opinion polls lately for mismanaging the economy and for delivering a multibillion-dollar deficit budget.  ""I smell a rat ... or scapegoat."""

399593,crankbait,2009-11-05 05:44:00,82," I wasn't too happy seeing this either, after assuming they paid $2300 for the shot perhaps."
399616,Toronto_Angler,2009-11-05 13:16:00,698,It's too bad that the public doesn't get this worried about two far deadlier epidemics. Smoking and Obesity.
399642,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-11-05 15:02:00,0,"Apparently the flu attacks the respiratory system so athletes may be at high risk, but what do I know. I'm not a doctor."
399680,johnnyb,2009-11-05 16:52:00,3413,"This whole FLames/flu shot thing has really been bugging me.  Here's all I have to say about it:  All the people that that went to the clinics in Calgary who were NOT ""high risk""  are just as ""bad"" as the Flames are being made out to be.  The organization in charge of organizing the clinics and the administration of shots absolutely dropped the ball by not making it clear that nobody should be lining up for a shot until the high risk public had been served first. They are totally dodging the bullet for a ridiculous lack of organization and preparedness, while the Flames team is made to look like villains. All kinds of non-high risk people stepped in front of those who needed the shot more.  Having a pricate clinic is no different than going to your doctor's instead of waiting in a long public clinic line. ok  all done."
399702,Governator,2009-11-05 18:09:00,879,"  Well said, agree completely.  Also I could be wrong but I thought they labelled professional athletes as high risk for contact sports?  Knowing that players within the league have been diagnosed with h1n1 and having to go out and play against each other nearly 3 days a week and practicing inbetween, I'd say that should count for something.  It would be a real shame if a team had to be sidelined because they were ill.  Hockey is Canada's sport that we as citizens talk about pretty much daily.  There isn't much that put smiles on our faces through the long winters up here and hockey is a way to compliment that.  Flames can't be blamed for anything here, this is blown out of proportion."
399718,MCTFisher9120,2009-11-05 19:18:00,3761,"They do have contact with hundreds of people every hockey game...O and they are rich, meaning they get first go."
399925,jnic,2009-11-06 04:24:00,158,"as i was waiting to get my 3 year old son the shot, they lined 1200 people in a high school gym for 4 hours, i cosider that high risk contact with others"
399951,Chris,2009-11-06 11:18:00,405,"There are lots of people that are not considered high risk who come in contact with many more people in a day than hockey players. There is a huge difference between high risk and having a high probability of coming in contact with someone who has been infected. Pregnant women and young children are high risk because the virus hits them much harder, not because of the number of people they are in contact with every day. Athletes are not high risk....in fact they have very healthy bodies that are better prepared to fight the virus."
399954,Greencoachdog,2009-11-06 11:30:00,8163,"So I took sick last weekend, went to see the doc Monday morning... I feared I had contracted the dreaded H1N1!!!  ... NOT!  Turns out I have Mycoplasma Pnuemonia... again!  I asked the doc aboot the H1N1, he told me that the fears were blown out of proportion for our area and since Sept. 1 he has only seen a dozen cases of influenza and of those dozen only 2 tested positive for the H1N1!   ...BUT!, he also told me I was the 5th case of Mycoplasma he had seen that day!!!  I love being sick!"
