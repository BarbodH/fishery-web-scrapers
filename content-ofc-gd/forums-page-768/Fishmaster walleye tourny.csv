399003,Fish4Eyes,2009-11-03 15:55:00,1022,"If you plan to fish right up to the dam, make your own anchors that you dont mind losing, and bring a few. I get my anchor stuck everytime I go out, and have lost several. Can be very dangerous to get it back at times too, as you are 5 feet away from the dam  pulling on the rope hoping it will get unstuck. Be careful."
