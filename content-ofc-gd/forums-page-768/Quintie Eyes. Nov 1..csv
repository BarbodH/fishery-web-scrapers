Meet AlieGoby in Mississauga for 3am and drive to Picton. Construction on the 401 delayed us about an hour which had Lloyd calling all worried like asking 'Where are you guys? Everything OK?' So needless to say we were'nt the first on the water. After the good-mornings we headed out. Got to the set up point just after 7am. Lloyd got everything set up for us and man does he work fast. With the riggers and planerboards set up we sat back in the heated shelter to play the waiting game. Didn't even get the door zipped shut...FISH ON.  Jose up first.   Nice one. Kept it due to bleeding.   Not long after BAM BAM Double Header   I got an eater in the box. Jose got a hog for a quick pic then back in.   Then it was fish after fish after fish......oh the dream day is comming true.         Some more double headers.      The action was pretty much non stop all day. In total we went 21 or 22 for 27 with one sheaphead. We kept 2 over the 24"" due to bleeding and 6 under. All others were quick picture and release. No weighing or anything just get it back in. They all swam away healthy. We kept the lines above the killzone 25'-30'. The planer lines were running 15-20' deep. This all helps to ensure safe release. Lloyd is very good about that. As we need to do what WE can to protect OUR fishery.  Again it was an awesome day. We headed for shore around 2pm. Could have fished longer but we had our limit and sore arms. Lloyd cleaned the fish and bagged them for us. Then it was off to home. Thanks again Lloyd it was great fishing with you as always.    "

398898,fishhunter,2009-11-03 03:15:00,604,ROB WATER WAS MIXED UP STILL FROM SAT BUT WAS 48-53. WATER TEMP IS GOOD. BAIT IS GOOD. FISH ARE GOOD.  NOW IF THE WEATHER STAYS KIND OF NORMAL SHOULD STAY GOOD. EAST WINDS WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING. LOTS OF FISH UP HIGH THAT YOU DONT MARK. DONT GET SUCKED IN BY THE ONES YOU MARK DEEP.

399063,Jet,2009-11-03 19:12:00,364,Lloyd you certain have a secret magnet for fish whether on Quinte or the Blue Zone. And good job to your crew for landing those pigs!

399119,basskicker09,2009-11-03 21:42:00,144,what a day out you guys had what do they charge for a day out on quintie i would love to get out there for fall walleye
399120,irishfield,2009-11-03 22:03:00,26272,"Lloyd does these ""OFC"" trips for the cost of fuel, just to keep himself out on the water when he has no customer bookings... so he doesn't lose track of where the fish are sitting idle like most charter guys do.  On the other hand if you don't want to be disappointed by waiting for a spot that doesn't open up..... you can contact him and book a charter. Can't be too many openings left as this weekend and next week are his last charters. We wrap up his season Friday the 13th (oh man!) Saturday and Sunday and then haul his boat home for the winter."
