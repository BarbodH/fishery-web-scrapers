398535,Twocoda,2009-11-02 03:35:00,4130,nice shooting ....persistence pays off ...and dont worry about the ones that you lost....they aided in this victory to make the moment that much sweeeeeter !!!  Good for you ...
398536,BillM,2009-11-02 03:42:00,17367,Is that fish missing an eye?
398539,spinnerdoc,2009-11-02 03:48:00,556,"lately man it's been all about just getting out and just enjoying fishing....numbers dont matter anymore, even 0's i don't mind. i've learned a long time ago that persistence, like you've said, pays.  it's been a few years now that i kinda touched this style of fishing, by that i mean one or 2 outings on the river a year, but this year i've decided to really give it a shot, this is how i got started last year with carp fishing.  if there's one thing i've learned so far is longer rod helps, still not a big fan of the super long rods, maybe it's bec i haven't tried them yet, he he...but i am happy with the 10' 6"" that i have.  see somone posted a link on shot spacing, that should be cool, what i have been doing is pretty much experimenting myself on the spacing, trying to figure out what works well for me."
398541,spinnerdoc,2009-11-02 03:53:00,556,"billm, no it's not, it's the angle that i took the shot. the fiesh went back just fine. i was in a hurry i didn't position the fish well to get a good scale. i think he's in the 23-25"" range. the cork on my rod is just under 21"" and the fish is well over that."

398882,StoneFly,2009-11-03 02:28:00,574," Either that or he is squinting, lol.  Nice fish nonetheless."
398883,young_one,2009-11-03 02:32:00,620,Nice fish! I can never fish well when its dark
398919,douG,2009-11-03 04:32:00,2693,"Very nice, spinnerdoc, if that's your real name.  The steelhead fishing in the tribs is a secret *shhhhhhhhhhhhh*.  Congratulations on solving the puzzle."

399229,spinnerdoc,2009-11-04 03:55:00,556,"thanks people. this year was great for me. didn't get to fish that much, as i was really busy summer time but i was able to get variety...also caught my first chinook this year, 2 actually. i am just happy to start getting a hang of drifting......i kinda understand why you guys are addicted to it....i'm still tweaking my shot spacing though, the last one was fine, needs a little tweaking......i hope i don't become an addict, dont mind if i do either-wife might not be too happy about it...ha ha"
