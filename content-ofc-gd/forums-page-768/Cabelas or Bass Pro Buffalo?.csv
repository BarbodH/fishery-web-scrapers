At Walden Galleria, the regular shopping selection is pretty good, maybe something for friends or family as xmas quickly approaches."

399621,Fang,2009-11-05 13:27:00,1330,"Gander Mountain is defintely worth the stop. Fishing section was OK and I found some very nice and well priced Gander brand plastics. Cleaned them out of the little 3"" senko style bait they had. I think in total I has 22 packs going back over the border. The hunting section is very nice, great cloting section."
