Ultyma and I are thinking of going out tonight, but I am unsure if it will be productive.  Will probably try it anyway as I am a junkie, but any pointers would be helpful to point us in the right direction.  Thanks in advance  Shawn"

You should also consider using spinners or crankbaits as these lures give off alot of vibration which is easier for the fish to track.  Basically you want to take advantage of the senses of the fish that are utilized most during night time; smell and sound.  Fish will use their lateral line to track down moving baits.  The nice thing about it is that usually, no one is around.  Good luck and report back and let us know how you made out.  All 3 are night time fish from various rivers:       Best of luck.  J"

It helps to fish somewhere where there is a street light.  Also it seems the fish will spread out at night - lay in shallows and edges of pools so try drifting everywhere."
399447,splashhopper,2009-11-04 21:13:00,2931,Love night fishing for trout...  get yourself a light that attaches to your float.. ( the smaller the better) http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...010000_100-10-4  and another one that attaches to your ball cap http://www.lakemichiganangler.com/store/Ca..._Cap_Lights.htm

399463,raptorfan,2009-11-04 22:05:00,126,I assume this rain isn't a good sign?
399469,BillM,2009-11-04 22:17:00,17367,"  If you fish tonight, make sure to check out the hydrocharts and record the flow numbers..  Make a little note book and you'll figure out that rain isn't always the enemy."
