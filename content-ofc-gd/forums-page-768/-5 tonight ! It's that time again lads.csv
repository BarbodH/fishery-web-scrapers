399937,limeyangler,2009-11-06 06:51:00,5204,"I'm on it Wayne, looks like i've got 3 days of 10 degrees C over the weekend, just hope the hose pipe thaws quickly this morning."
399960,cranks bait,2009-11-06 11:54:00,721,"Gee whiz Wayne, don't you think you are pushing it a bit?  I mean the river doesn't freeze over till the first week of January, the boating is great right up until the day before.....Lot's of time left"
399985,Raf,2009-11-06 14:05:00,3495,winterize wayne? there's still several weeks of good fishn  will be out on the bay till we have to break ice.
399996,thalweg,2009-11-06 14:23:00,112, Yup and luckily I managed to fit the boat in the garage...no winterizing for me ever again(maybe a dash of stabilizer here and there)....Hallelujah!!
400001,irishfield,2009-11-06 14:35:00,26272," So will I Raf.. so will I !!    But the water in the boat will freeze sitting in the laneway, or hauling it home from your favourite fishing hole, long before the bay goes stiff !   .. and that gets expensive."
400006,johnnyb,2009-11-06 14:48:00,3413, Dude...you're supposed to keep that thing under the covers with you so you don't have that problem when you wake up
