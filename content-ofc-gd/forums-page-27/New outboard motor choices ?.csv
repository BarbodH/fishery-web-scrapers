1063837,pike slayer,2020-07-03 10:57:00,1177,If you look and see what motor fishing lodges and charters use you'll see most use Yamaha and there's a good reason why.
1063839,RS680,2020-07-03 12:34:00,13,"I have had Almost all the brands before. Merc use to be the best but that has not been true in a very long time and imo i think they are the worst of them all today,Â  Evenrude etec scares me long term and now with them not making motors i would not touch them.Â  Also i have blown up 6 e tec snowmoblie engines in 12 years so i would pass on evenrude nowÂ  So when i order my new boat last month i went with Yamaha this will be my first one but to be honest i here nothing but good things about them.Â  They are in all the remote places i go. SoÂ  Yamaha for Quiality Evenrude for power and speed Merc for Price."
1063945,krr6581,2020-07-08 21:01:00,5,"Hey Hack, there are some great deals to be had on new Evinrudes since this is the last year BRP is making outboards. BRP has to honor all warranties and they are required to continue producing replacement parts. Â It may be a bit more than a good used motor but you can buy new and get it at pretty darn good price."
1064216,Hack_Fisherman,2020-07-21 09:59:00,720,"Thanks guys, Iâ€™ve decided that buying new is risky for me right now with out potential pending economic doomÂ ~$11k for motor and controls out the door for an Etec, more for a Suzuki. Iâ€™mÂ Sticking with used until the horizon looks better"
1063259,Hack_Fisherman,2020-06-15 23:27:00,720,"Iâ€™m not sure if the usedÂ market isÂ extremely slim pickings this year or if itâ€™s because the fact Iâ€™m actually looking to buy makes it seem so. Nothing in the era thatÂ Iâ€™m looking for and everything else Â is questionable or antique,Â worn out overpriced junk or parts motors. In any regard, Iâ€™m now considering going new.Â Â I was planning on buying a good used 60 or 70 OMC and then moving up to a new EtecÂ in three or four years, Â but the latest announcement regarding the end of Evinrude Â has me questioning where I should go now.Â I priced out a 60 horse EtecÂ last year and I feel pricesÂ shot up $1k Â shortly after Evinrude production closure wasÂ announced. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d want to buy one now anyway for fear that there will not be warrantyÂ or Parts support down the road. So whatÂ does that leave me?Â Â Mercury, Suzuki, Yamaha? It might be time that I embrace four stroke technology. Who is the leading group there? 60-70hp range preferred."
1063261,AKRISONER,2020-06-15 23:37:00,5558,Depending on the era totally changes your options. If itâ€™s pre-2001 two Stroke Yamaha  four strokes in the 2000â€™sÂ thereâ€™s a million Mercuryâ€™s out there kicking around. Those four stroke are bulletproof from my experience.  2010-2018 four strokeÂ anything japanese. Too much power for you but those Honda Civic outboardsÂ are insanely reliable
1063264,porkpie,2020-06-16 01:51:00,2521,Iâ€™ve been very pleased with my Suzuki if that helps you any. Â I was super happy with the Honda I owned before as well. Â Either one would make me smile!
1063265,DRIFTER_016,2020-06-16 03:33:00,10439,How about one of these new tillers?Â ðŸ˜œ   
1063267,Hack_Fisherman,2020-06-16 10:53:00,720,"Thanks guys. I'm going to start poking around the marine dealers. Upgrading a 45 year old motor to a 25-30 year old motor, if I can even find one seems like a lot of trouble and risk. Especially for the waters I want to explore. (Need reliability) Something really fuel efficient would be welcome too, especially for waterbodies with lots of distance to cover"
1063274,grimsbylander,2020-06-16 15:46:00,3016,"Google is your friend. Search the make, model, year and hp class thoroughly prior to buying anything. Opinions on here are just that, opinions. Do your homework! "
1063276,David Chong,2020-06-16 16:43:00,836,My only experience with four strokes is with the Yamaha's that I've had over the years and I truly believe that they are the most reliable outboard available currently. That by far is the most important thing to me. knowing that I'm getting back!
1063292,Woodsman,2020-06-16 22:37:00,1286,Don't overlook Tohatsu. They made many of the others small to medium 4 strokes. 
1063294,Hack_Fisherman,2020-06-16 23:42:00,720,"I quite agree. However Google is quite the rabbit hole. Then again asking this question here on a forum is the same thing. Everybody has opinions. Â The marine version of Ford versus Chevy versus dodge.Â I will have to pick and choose where I side. (And Â lwith the written word itâ€™s hard to tell sometimes or somebodyâ€™s coming across. I hope I did not comeÂ across as lazy.)Â I tendÂ to post a lot of questions on forums;Â Â a) Â it gives us something to discuss. AndÂ it stimulates traffic and activity on a forum which it needs to survive and prosper. b) Â itâ€™s interaction and connection with people albeitÂ digitally.Â c) Â discussions and ideas brought forth might bring something to the table I might not have thought of on my own Â by just reading reviews How many years or hours do you typically run them before you buy another? Â Your post indicates you have had several. Like cars, Â some people turn them over in a number of years instead of driving them into the ground. I had heard that they make powerheads for others. Do you know what the factory support is like in Ontario as far as warranty and serviceÂ is concerned? Should I go new,Â I think part of the deciding factor will be in regards to how many service shops there are for that brand. If thereâ€™s only one distributor/service shopÂ in 100 kÂ radius from me,Â that concerns me. Iâ€™m stuck dealing with one shop if I donâ€™t like them. I canâ€™t find a Honda dealer anywhere within a 2 Hour Dr. Thereâ€™s a few Yamaha. One Suzuki. And a few dealers that are selling Mercury. What are you guys think about Evinrude getting out of motors? Do you think there be a good factory service for years to come? Â I wonder if the mercury dealers will take over repairs. Â I thought I had heard that Evinrude/OMC Â I partnered up with mercury to manufacture motors for their boats. So I wonder if itâ€™s going to be a situation like jeep. Itâ€™s basically a Chrysler product now.Â Â Mopar whatever you wanna call it. Do you think thatâ€™s going to be the same with Evinrude/mercury?"
1063297,David Chong,2020-06-17 01:29:00,836,"Depended on the year and the engine, I put on a fair number of hours per season. the most I've put on an engine in a season was 185 hrs. and the most that I've put on a single engine over a four years was 650 hrs. I also know most of the people who had purchased my boats & engine and the only one that ever blew up was an Evinrude from 2004!"
1063299,AKRISONER,2020-06-17 02:10:00,5558,"Iâ€™m running a 22 year old Yamaha...thing starts like itâ€™s new, doesnâ€™t really put out much smoke for a two stroke and hasnâ€™t given me a single issue and I definitely run it close to 100 hours a year. I also have an 88 suzuki that runs and has been abused horribly over the years lol. The original oil pump still works I donâ€™t even have to run mix in it. previous owner told me the only thing ever done on it was the valve cover gasket. Aside from that itâ€™s oem. I changed the impeller in it when I bought it. Thatâ€™s it."
1063306,hutch4113,2020-06-17 13:00:00,374,So far I love my Evinrude - so it was disappointing to see the BRP is ending the line (I am on 2.5 seasons with a G1 135HO).Â  They have sold it entirely to Mercury - so it will be interesting to see what happens.Â  But perhaps you can get a great deal on a clearance Evinrude?
1063307,BillM,2020-06-17 13:27:00,17367,"Yamaha, Suzuki, Honda."
1063319,craigdritchie,2020-06-17 16:32:00,1586,"The honest truth is that among today's 50 hp to 75 hp engines there really isn't a bad choice, they're all very close in terms of fuel efficiency and overall reliability. Go to each manufacturer's website and you can read the specifics on each ... there are some minor weight and feature differences that might swing you one way or another. But the biggest difference is most likely going to come down to the dealer you buy it from ... some may offer incentives that the others don't, or be more convenient for service etc.  Just for clarity, BRP did not sell Evinrude to Mercury, or to anyone else. Evinrude is discontinued, meaning BRP still owns the name and such but will no longer build the engines.  "
1063320,hutch4113,2020-06-17 17:08:00,374,You are correct - I misread the news article.
1063502,RS680,2020-06-21 18:08:00,13,I just Bought a new 2020 YamahaÂ  50 HPÂ  I have had Merc but i am not a big fan But Yamaha and Suzuki are great.
1063507,cisco,2020-06-22 00:38:00,597,Also check with the marinas/dealers you prefer. They may have some coming in from folks upgrading. May helpÂ a sales person selling when they can tell their prospect they can sell theirÂ old one.
1063514,leaf4,2020-06-22 10:44:00,2466,"I'm in a similar situation as OP here... Looking to re power and have found tohatsu to be very well priced. I inquired about a 50 hp console model 4 stroke and pricing was $6071 brand new. I was about to pull the trigger on a 2013 I came across on Kijiji but the guy wanted $4500 for it, (probably would have haggled him down) and he hadn't had it running since 2016 when he purchased it from someone else. For $1500~ I don't want someone else's issues if there are any, plus there's a brand new warranty."
1063525,Steve Piggott,2020-06-22 16:10:00,196,A lot of older four stroke mercuryÂ  are Yamaha engine with mercury bottom end. I have a 12 year old 90 mercury 4 stroke with 1500 hr on it. Have never had a problemÂ  yet.
1063678,ecmilley,2020-06-27 04:35:00,2163,Need to look at dealer support all engines are.pretty.decent butnif you need to drive 3 hours for service not a great choice pick one thats close to you and.most places you go
1063679,bigcreekdad,2020-06-27 11:54:00,546,"For what it's worth, I've had 4 outboards in the last 35 years....one Suzuki, one Johnson, and two Yamahas (4 strokes)....in that order. Suzuki was great, Both Yams great. The Johnson was a huge POS....couldn't wait to get rid of it."
1063682,Hack_Fisherman,2020-06-27 15:28:00,720,What year was the Johnny? 2 stroke on that one?
1063685,bigcreekdad,2020-06-27 16:39:00,546,"Hack....I'm guessing 1988. Regardless of tuning, filter changes, etc. it would commonly stall after slowing down from near wide open. When this happened, about 50% of the time, it would flood trying to restart it. This then required unhooking gas line from engine, and trying to restart with choke wide open. Mechanics always concluded there was nothing wrong with it."
1063690,AKRISONER,2020-06-28 12:21:00,5558,"Iâ€™m gonna also chime in and tell you that my 88 suzuki still goes, Â my 94 Johnson is dead with electrical issues that couldnâ€™t be fixed without buying a new control module every year the thing kept frying itself. The 98 Yamaha runs like a top. The 2002 Mercury is running but itâ€™s had electrical problems as well that we were able to fix."
1063721,Hack_Fisherman,2020-06-29 13:00:00,720,Thanks again guys. I havenâ€™t got any new pricing yet. Every day I search Kijiji or FB marketplace for used. I was hoping to find a 90â€™s or early 2000â€™s OMC 60 or 70 as I had always heard they were solid...but perhaps not. Finding 70 Yamahas is like finding hens teeth. But this Covid recession and likely soon to be depression really has me concerned about spending $10k on a brand new toy. I donâ€™t know if I can pull the trigger on new
