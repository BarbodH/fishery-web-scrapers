Just enough time for some lure washing and a swim before the clouds looked like they might end the day with a soaking. Nothing big was caught, but we were just glad to get out and relax on the water.           "
1064616,canoecarrier,2020-08-03 22:44:00,54,Can't beat a day on the water! Even if its a short one! Looks like you went up just in time! This just happened toÂ the road! Wonder how long of a hike it is?
1064622,Dave Bailey,2020-08-04 00:54:00,1641,"WOW! Where exactly is that, somewhere on Deep Bay Road, or Devil's Lake Road?"
1064652,Ronzo,2020-08-05 12:36:00,124,That looks like the Deep Bay Road washout between Gull and Devil's.
