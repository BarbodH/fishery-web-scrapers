Thanks in advance. Adam"

Basically your new system will not be as good an upgrade as you hope for. This is an adapter that MIGHT make it work with   https://www.solidsignal.com/pview.asp?p=000-11040-001 I would upgrade the unit 100 percent with the correct transducer rather than spend  100 bucks for the adapter and then having a limited upgrade.
