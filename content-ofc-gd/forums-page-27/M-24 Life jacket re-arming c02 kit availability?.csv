1064444,Raycaster,2020-07-29 14:03:00,528,Anyone seen these kits available in Hamilton area? BassPro in Barrie has limited stock but unable to track down any in my area. The fun of getting a used boat is finding the first hole in the hull right underneath the life jacket storage cubby. Open it up to find the self inflated jacket the other day! (At least I know it works). The last time I bought a kit I found 1 at the CT in Brantford. Installed great but realized the expiry date WAY old. Could order online but trying to save shipping.

Opened the back door in my pickup last week  only to find my vests manual handle somehow got pulled and..... bps here is outta stock! My friend works there and put in a priority order for me! But he cant promise anything! I hate wearing a regular life jacket on a hot day and i always do wear one!
