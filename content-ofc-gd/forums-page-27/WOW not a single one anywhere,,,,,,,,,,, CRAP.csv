1064434,cheaptackle,2020-07-28 19:11:00,849,"Survey SAYS:  Better keep the 55 - I broadened the search parameters , got prices from 169.00 to 900.00 for  the Endura c2 30 #, but not one has stock, expects stock or has stock in any franchise location in Canada.  This makes me think (ouch!) it may be a mere mention in history now as in outta production.  Might could get one of the chains BP or Cab's to order one in from the states - dunno if they could or what it would do to the price.  Good luck!

1064435,MJIG,2020-07-28 19:20:00,227,"Maybe try CTC in Campbellford, Ontario https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/minn-kota-endura-c2-trolling-motor-30-lb-30-in-0798580p.html "
1064436,IGotWorms,2020-07-28 21:01:00,4,Used to post here a long long time ago.  Your post made me actually recover my password. I've got an older one (30 or 35) hanging on the shop wall that hasn't seen the water in years.  Runs fine last I tried it (3 years ago?)She needs a home.  About 10 mins N. of Port Severn.  Shoot me a msg. if you're interested. P.S. Bring beer.
1064440,DRIFTER_016,2020-07-29 00:23:00,10439,I've got one with virtually no time on it. Would have to either come and git it or pay for shipping.  😁
1064446,akaShag,2020-07-29 15:39:00,2073,"I'll come pick it up, Dave.  But I have to quarantine for 14 days after I get there, so can I please borrow your boat and your cottage?  😁"

1064448,glen,2020-07-29 15:56:00,2641,So your 55 is already gone?
1064449,misfish,2020-07-29 16:06:00,29133,"Yes, but I have another 55 thrust coming up soon. It is a bow mount hand control . I removed the motor, rotated the head,added a clamp to it and used it as a stern mount. I still have the flip up mount. "
1064450,glen,2020-07-29 16:11:00,2641,You can borrow mine but I’m not sure I want to sell/trade it.  As I need it.
1064451,misfish,2020-07-29 16:29:00,29133,"Thanks Glen. Not really in a rush at the moment, but thanks for the generous offer. I need to row for a bit and work off a TON or 2.LOL"
1064454,Court R,2020-07-29 17:50:00,213,"I bought a Minnkota 34lb at Bass Pro in Niagara last weekend, they had stock of the 34lb think it was $169 but not the 30lb."
1064457,glen,2020-07-29 18:08:00,2641,the 34lb might be too much power.  Better stick to 30lb.   	I guess if you can’t get a trolling motor I can tow you out with my boat. You can pay me in fish.
1064458,Terry,2020-07-29 18:48:00,14456,If it’s too much power you turn it down one notch and it only does 30 lbs thrust I would rather be overpowered then be under powered on a motor

1064475,AKRISONER,2020-07-30 13:51:00,5558,"This is a huge problem fishing industry wide. Covid has gotten people on the water more than ever. With no gatherings, parties, weddings, events etc people have started going boating more than ever before. From bait shops to boat dealers, everyone is booming. Theres apparently a huge outboard shortage right now as well. Really really difficult to almost get anything new this year."
