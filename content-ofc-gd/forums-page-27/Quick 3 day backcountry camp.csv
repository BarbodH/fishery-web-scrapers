1064102,Rustic-Fisher,2020-07-16 22:17:00,826,"Did a quick backcountry camp with the family , great times and fishing .  	Started with utilizing a launch point a little sketchy with low water levels , first time the lifted truck was useful lol. No pics as the stress levels were high on this particular launch . With the Boat loaded , two kids (10and 7) two dogs wife and myself we began the crawl to camp through the rock invested prop killing  lake . Again no pics , to much going on . 	Landed at a site we’ve visited for years and within an 30 min my son was walking the islands steep shoreline casting 3” tubes for smallies and connecting !  	Once camp was set up I joined him casting  a larger 4” smoke color tube hoping to get in on the action ..... picked up the odd one but kid destroyed me , downsizing was key. Fishing was great ,  we pounded all the rocky shoals and weed edges , classic ambush points . Seems smaller tubes in natural colors and reaction strikes with jerk/twitch baits in a perch pattern were the ticket .  Both The Smallies and walleye (evening bite) we were crushing them .  	I didn’t have a chance to take fish pics , I apologize. No giants but steady 1-3 lb fish . Also found a beauty sandy beach area , on a small island SCORE ! Cool note !!My kids were wading the rocky area of the island looking for minnows and crayfish and my son found what looks to be a legit carved  arrow head, you can only imagine their imaginations running wild over at the camp fire that night over this discovery. Great trip ,  family loved it, everyone is gassed Including both dogs , and trust me ...it’s an extreme challenge to tire out a Belgian Malinois working dog lol.              "

1064122,mukluk,2020-07-17 21:00:00,196,Good memories had by all Rustic.  I can relate to that when Dad would take my brother and I boating on Sturgeon Lake back in the early 1950's.  He ran the old 16 ft. cedar strip boat and 25 hp. Johnson up on what was a nice swimming area.  I began skipping stones across the water when I reached down for a white one.  Turned out to be an arrow head; same as yours. Keeping it for my grand daughter when she gets a little older. The dog looks wasted for sure.
