1063600,grimsbylander,2020-06-24 17:23:00,3016,"After about 7 years of insuring my boat with the same company, this year they‚Äôre asking for a survey. Strangely, a friend of mine who uses a different insurance company also got asked for a survey this year.¬† 	I need to shop for another carrier."
1063601,North Channel Cottages,2020-06-24 18:01:00,18,What does the survey entail?
1063607,Chris J,2020-06-24 19:47:00,44,Thanks fro reminding me to cancel mine.
1063613,Pigeontroller,2020-06-24 20:33:00,2793,"Seems to be another new normal. You can probably still be insured without it, just effects your 'replacement' value."
1063614,misfish,2020-06-24 20:37:00,29133,Seems to me another stretch of taking money out of your pockets. I was told the same thing when I bought my 87 Ranger. I didn't get one. Got full insurance coverage from another company.  State Farm    
1063619,porkpie,2020-06-24 22:54:00,2521,Glass boat?
1063624,grimsbylander,2020-06-25 00:49:00,3016,Around $20 per foot and some dude crawling around your boat trying to find problems. I think its a scam. Time to start shopping.  Yes sir.
1063627,irishfield,2020-06-25 03:55:00,26272,"Year 13 and they just gladly take my $960. That's $100 more than my truck insurance, but then again the boat has a full agreed replacement value of almost twice what my F150 is worth."
1063629,AKRISONER,2020-06-25 10:54:00,5558,"Ya no one would do mine without one and I tried. Hence no insurance on my rig. A total scam and pita. They list blue book on my boat at $1,000 and expected me to spend more than that just to get insurance in the first place. What a joke. anyone know if general liability insurance provided by OFAH would help me with actual liability so that I could fish larger organized tournaments?"
1063633,Garnet,2020-06-25 13:43:00,2056,"It's important for larger boats . For a bassboat maybe not, but lot's of people would learn a ton watching survey. If they paid attention. "
1063636,OhioFisherman,2020-06-25 14:04:00,6623,"A lot of boats? had problems with the wood in the transom rotting out? A lot harder to notice on a glass boat than an aluminum boat? From a liability standpoint giving insurance to an older sight unseen boat might open the¬† insurance company to more battles? The need for speed? There wasn't as many boats that came close to the speed of today's boats when I was young and who knows how good they are maintained? Lots things can go wrong, and the price to fix them or replace them keeps climbing?"
1063644,AKRISONER,2020-06-25 16:55:00,5558,"Gotta pay to play. Agreed that if you wanna run the boat 100kmh you hope your boat is well manufactured and been taken care of. Maybe I also just got lucky with my rig that the hull was made by skeeter and has been bulletproof so far. I already know though the bunks have put a few bad spots into the hull, i can see them when I swim beneath my boat. Tough to work on a boat though without being able to jack it up somehow."
1063648,Garnet,2020-06-25 22:32:00,2056,jacking boat off trailer no problem. Lower tough jack to bottom. Now block the back with appropriate wood like 6x6 and 2 pieces cut 45. Now crank jack up to top block same. Roll trailer out. Remember you will be under this thing.
1063650,grimsbylander,2020-06-26 00:16:00,3016,It‚Äôs really not too hard putting a bassboat up on blocks. A lot easier than fixing a hull after it‚Äôs been sucking up water anyway. Still need to make calls this week to see if I can get insurance without the survey. üòé
1063651,grimsbylander,2020-06-26 00:35:00,3016,Your hull is pre-2004 making it not susceptible to delaminations and blisters....unless you smack a rock of course. All the older bassboat hulls are ‚Äúbulletproof‚Äù as you call it.
1063652,AKRISONER,2020-06-26 02:25:00,5558,"A change in chemicals used in the fiberglass or gel coat to meet some kind of environmental standard....or did they realize there was some kinda crazy carcinogenic compound they were using to do the fiberglass?¬†I‚Äôve been reading horror stories, specifically about Phoenix boats and it really surprised me. What gives?"
1063653,AKRISONER,2020-06-26 02:29:00,5558,I might just have to do this boat jacking up thing to re-gel some of that fiberglass. Hell it doesn‚Äôt even have to look good you can‚Äôt see it unless you literally swim underneath the boat and look at the very very back.
1063654,grimsbylander,2020-06-26 02:41:00,3016,"Yup, EPA forced manufacturers to change the compound in the resin and hulls have never been the same. Maybe it‚Äôs a good thing for the environment but some of the issues guys are having are horrible. Especially the areas along the bunks where the boat rests on the trailer.¬† 	Another ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt make enough like they used to‚Äù story!"
1063655,grimsbylander,2020-06-26 02:46:00,3016,"The glass work is easy. I‚Äôve done lots of little touch ups on my boat.¬† 	You‚Äôre right about the bottom too, as long as it‚Äôs fairly smooth you‚Äôre good to go. Getting it smooth is easy as well. Because you have to cover the resin with plastic to keep the oxygen away (so it will cure) you can give it a light roll with a can or use a putty knife to smooth out the resin. Easy peasy and no water in your fibreglass."
1063656,AKRISONER,2020-06-26 02:48:00,5558,I‚Äôm gonna pm you about this jacking up the boat procedure. I‚Äôve watched a couple of videos but it scares the hell outta me
1063950,Bill,2020-07-09 03:16:00,140,"I have pulled my boat off the trailer by putting a 2X2 square pipe across the bow. Then use heavy duty ratchet straps, like the ones towing companies use, to cradle the hull and secured to the 2X2. Using my chain falls I lift the bow off the trailer. I do the same procedure near the stern but I use my engine hoist to lift the stern off the trailer. Then I roll the trailer out. After the trailer is out of the way I lower the boat onto wood protecting on the top of¬† jack stands."
1063963,AKRISONER,2020-07-10 12:13:00,5558,Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have a nice level concrete floor or an engine hoist. There‚Äôs lots of great YouTube videos of guys doing it this way...I‚Äôm still pestering my old man to tear our old beat up garage down at the lake and put a proper workshop in so that we can do this kinda stuff. It‚Äôs even more annoying in the winter working on snowmobiles outside. he seems to be warming up to the idea now that he‚Äôs living there full time.
