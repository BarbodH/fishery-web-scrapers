After the five mile run out, pretty quiet until an 8 lb Rainbow hit the rigger. Stayed quiet until we decided to start trolling in as it was getting late. Triple header of Chinnies made for a few minutes of chaos. One spit the hook and the other two made it to the boat. Was a blast and looking forward to our next trip! For some unknown reason I can't post the pic right side up! HH"
