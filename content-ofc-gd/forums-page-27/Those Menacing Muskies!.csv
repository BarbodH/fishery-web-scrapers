1064496,Benthook,2020-07-31 15:30:00,56,Woman attacked by Muskie in northwestern Ontario lake | Toronto Sun https://torontosun.com/news/provincial/woman-attacked-by-muskie-in-northwestern-ontario-lake  This article doesn't terribly surprise me as Muskies can be crazy aggressive if there on the hunt for something! I have seen a musky take a duckling off the top of the water before and have heard stories of small dogs going missing from time to time but to go at someone's calf is a whole new one for me! Only sense I can make of it is perhaps the muskie mistook the backside of her calf as a wounded fish's belly ripe for the taking!
