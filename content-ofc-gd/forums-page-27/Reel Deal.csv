Scam, perhaps??                                 https://www.fagiftc.com/products/the-ultra-light-stradic-reel-store-anniversary-promotion-outdoor-fishing-artifact?fbclid=IwAR1vDrlDwyC_8bgzJcvDEZfJv5ml6MPb6jhU1qY4-Bw8L6NDpda5Kuj9xY8"
1064151,gino,2020-07-18 22:14:00,400,"For sure it's a stardic knock off, not a Shimano product. Not sure how reliable the reel is, looks good...they have a Stella, also...😁😁"
1064155,OhioFisherman,2020-07-19 00:29:00,6623,The price seems too good to be true? 
1064158,John Bacon,2020-07-19 00:56:00,3277,Some people say that you pay for the name.  I don't see the name anywhere on the reel; maybe that's why it's priced so low.   😉
1064164,BillM,2020-07-19 03:55:00,17367,Knockoff Chinese garbage.  Notice it never mentions Shimano?  LOL!

1064169,SirCranksalot,2020-07-19 12:47:00,3291,"Thx, guys. I will give this one a pass. Too good to be true. "
1064170,aplumma,2020-07-19 13:48:00,6896,My rule of thumb is if it is a new brand name item and it is not a personal sale  and the price is less than what a reasonable profit margin is then I pass. Art
1064180,jjcanoe,2020-07-19 19:05:00,744,"Fishing Artifact? Lmao "", which can make you more labor-saving when fishing. The perfect structure allows the fishing reel to run at high speed, so you have no worries about fishing."" LOL who writes these ads?!"
1064184,Whitespinnerbait,2020-07-19 22:56:00,2038,Scam.....
1064717,GBW,2020-08-07 01:23:00,8460,That's what they send. And it's not built well at all and feels off balance/broken internally.    
1064718,gino,2020-08-07 01:32:00,400,Hmm...doesn't even look like the one  from the comercial...
1064721,misfish,2020-08-07 08:50:00,29133,Take it a part and show us the inners. Looks purty though. LOL 
1064725,BillM,2020-08-07 14:29:00,17367,That's quality right there folks!
1064735,GBW,2020-08-08 03:59:00,8460,I can Mr B for you if I find time this weekend.
