1064006,smitty55,2020-07-12 02:43:00,928,"The owner is Dave Smetana and his wife Cara, they have four young lads. I've known him for a long time but had lost touch after a mutual friend passed away. He used to have his own security business and as well still operates an archery only deer camp on 500 acres of private land not too far from Innisville. All American clients. Real nice guy, super hard worker that goes way out of his way to keep clients happy. He bought the place in 2014 and hasn't looked back. Won awards in his first two years and Canada in the Rough and Extreme Angler have done shows there. Not just fishing, he also runs bear baits. I wouldn't hesitate to give him a call to get answers to your questions. Looks to be booked up for the most part till September from what I see on his website. https://www.olivethelake.com/ Here's a short video from Keith Beasley up there before Dave bought it. "
