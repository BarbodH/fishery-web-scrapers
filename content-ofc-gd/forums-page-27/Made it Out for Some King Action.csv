1064316,David Chong,2020-07-25 01:27:00,836,"I had heard that the Summer Salmon season was going well so we had to go try it ourselves. Myself & 3 friends went out for a morning fish out of Lakefront Promenade. Tons of bait around and so were the Kings. I do believe that we went 8 for 11 for the morning with 3 in the 18-20 lbs. range. Lots of fun, gonna get back out there soon!      "

1064321,misfish,2020-07-25 14:39:00,29133,Nice David. Talked to a buddy this morning that was out. He said his arms were about to fall off after a great day out. Last fish was on lead core 300 ft out. LOL
1064363,cisco,2020-07-26 22:51:00,597,Great catch!  You eat them?!?! I thought they were quite contaminated out in Lake Ontario.
1064367,David Chong,2020-07-27 01:49:00,836,Not I but my friends wanted to! I think in moderation they’re fine!

1064375,Canuck,2020-07-27 10:47:00,491,Is it my imagination or are the fish skinnier this year than in the past? We went through a few years on Georgian Bay when the salmon were very skinny.  Things have come back and now they seem fatter on the Bay. for the past couple years.  I have yet to get one in 2020 but I am hearing that they are nice and fat again up here.
