1064658,AKRISONER,2020-08-05 17:39:00,5558,well i posted the question to my instagram and got my answer. Its the plastic piece from within the rubber housing of the reel. Of course this is not listed on the schematic at all.  Does anyone know if there is a place to get these kind of parts. It makes it even more difficult to get a part when theres no associated parts number for it...or further more what the part is actually called. any ideas im all ears! Im not sure how that plastic piece went missing but it sucks that its gone!

1064664,kickingfrog,2020-08-05 19:29:00,8333,Would you have to buy the whole housing instead?
1064665,kickingfrog,2020-08-05 19:31:00,8333,Or find a scrap reel and salvage the part? 
1064666,AKRISONER,2020-08-05 19:33:00,5558,"thats exactly what Im looking at, the part seems to be discontinued and i have no idea whered id find a scrap. At the end of the day if the reel is toast ill set it to someone for parts or something, ive already got an offer of $20 lolllll"
1064667,misfish,2020-08-05 19:42:00,29133,"Well I have a few old and yes,Â  old reels. Guess what the drag disk is made of ?  FELT  Yup, just felt. May or may not be fancy , but I would say cut a piece and see it that works. It worked then, why not now ?"
1064668,AKRISONER,2020-08-05 19:45:00,5558,the problem is that i cant assemble that housing because the plastic piece that holds the spring is missing. Thats the part that holds it together and why I cant get my reel back together. Interestingly there were felt drag disks within the housing as well when i took it apart.
1064672,misfish,2020-08-05 20:57:00,29133,"So you need the retaining clip ?  Rockys. If he cant,well, guess Nick gets a $20 reel. LOL"
1064676,Fisherman,2020-08-05 21:35:00,7201,"Hahahaha, and what did I say on the 30th of June,Â  it belongs to the spool"
1064677,misfish,2020-08-05 21:50:00,29133,"That clip ,does not look like this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LOL  "
1064681,Fisherman,2020-08-05 23:00:00,7201,"First page, 3rd pic that's the little compression spring.Â  Now if AK lost the 4 sided expansion clip, you can buy stainless wire that's pretty springy and easy to make."
1063754,AKRISONER,2020-06-30 19:47:00,5558,"Hey guys, was doing a clean up and grease of an old used stradic that I picked up on the cheap. I started breaking it down, took the spool off and just did some cleaning in and around the gearing without taking anything apart further than simply exposing the gearing. Re-assembled the reel and sure enough I came out with an extra spring somehow that managed to roll away from my row of parts. now I canâ€™t bloody figure out where the heck it belongs to. Iâ€™ve stared at the schemantic for hours and canâ€™t seem to figure out where in the heck the spring is even on the parts list. https://www.ereplacementparts.com/shimano-st2500fh-stradic-spinning-reel-parts-c-200301_200302_205226.html I then watched Two 45 minute videosÂ of a guys disassembling the stradic 4000 of the same year and then another 2500 of a different model of hopes of seeing the part. The one of the 4000 unfortunately the guy doesnâ€™t take a lot of the pieces fully apart. Iâ€™m rattled...did I just blow a perfectly good reel? I tried reassembling without the spring and something is definitely wrong. I canâ€™t get the drag assembly to tighten up, yet with it simply on the shaft it seems to space it out to far! Iâ€™m lost. If any of you reel gurus or guys that are good with drawings can take a look and throw your ideas at me Iâ€™d greatly appreciate it. Heck maybe even one of you guys owns one of these all time classic jdm spinning reels! thanks in advance!"
1063755,Fisherman,2020-06-30 19:49:00,7201,Says your second picture doesn't exist. 
1063756,AKRISONER,2020-06-30 19:51:00,5558,Hopefully fixed now? Using an iPhone to post images from up north. Pain in the ass.
1063757,Fisherman,2020-06-30 19:53:00,7201,"Looking at others, I found it may be a ""click spring""Â  doesn't show where though. https://www.ereplacementparts.com/click-spring-p-1540425.html"
1063758,Fisherman,2020-06-30 19:54:00,7201,What's the model number?
1063759,Fisherman,2020-06-30 19:58:00,7201,"Nope,Â  hahaha, don't despair."

1063764,OhioFisherman,2020-06-30 21:04:00,6623,"https://www.mikesreelrepair.com/shimano-stradic-2500fh-schematic/ Usually good schematics https://www.mikesreelrepair.com/content/schematics/Shimano_stradic_2500fh.pdf I see only two springs listed in the parts for that reel, 7467 looks like the one to me,"
1063766,AKRISONER,2020-06-30 21:15:00,5558,"I thought so too, but I realized thatâ€™s the drag clicker...I had that piece out It was really really tiny, a whole different ordeal as I was taking it apart 7466 fell on the floor lol I can confirm that 7467 is less than half the size of this spring.  see now Iâ€™m tripping out because you guys donâ€™t see any springs either. This schematic you provided is great though!"
1063767,misfish,2020-06-30 21:19:00,29133,Any broken ball point pens laying around ? LOL
1063768,AKRISONER,2020-06-30 21:27:00,5558,"Iâ€™m literally wondering that, but the fact that the reel doesnâ€™t seem to want to go together again is throwing me off big time!"
1063769,kickingfrog,2020-06-30 21:56:00,8333,1520? Hard to see with low resolution. That spring is much more robust that the drag clicker and bail springs that I've seen.
1063770,misfish,2020-06-30 22:12:00,29133,
1063771,kickingfrog,2020-06-30 22:24:00,8333,Then nope. Not even close.
1063772,smitty55,2020-07-01 00:33:00,928,I would suggest you contact Rocky's Reel Service and show them the pic of that spring. As mentioned it seems to be a fairly heavy spring that appears to be for keeping tension on some assy. Good luck.
1063773,grimsbylander,2020-07-01 01:06:00,3016,"It looks like the type of spring used to maintain load on a ball bearing. Iâ€™d go right back in and look for any thing resembling an exposed ball bearing. A short spring like that isnâ€™t designed to have travel, just load."
1063774,grimsbylander,2020-07-01 01:09:00,3016,"Oh, and check to make sure your bail spring isnâ€™t broken. Could possibly be a piece off the end of it."
1063775,Fisherman,2020-07-01 01:12:00,7201,Possibility that it belongs in the spool itself?
1063783,AKRISONER,2020-07-01 14:03:00,5558,Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m wondering! It would make sense but itâ€™s mind blowing that itâ€™s not listed in the schematic. Its also very possible that itâ€™s a broken piece off of somewhere else? i reachedÂ out to th kustoms and I will try reach out to rockys. I may just also send this reel in with a curado that I own that has some internal issues that need to be cleaned up. Still cheaper than buying new especially these days.
1063793,grimsbylander,2020-07-01 15:48:00,3016, It looks like the end of the bail spring.
1063794,NAW,2020-07-01 15:55:00,4022,Ill buy the reel off you for $20 as is...ðŸ˜‡
1063812,AKRISONER,2020-07-02 03:08:00,5558,Haha...Iâ€™m almost considering it at this point. Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s worth it for me to send off to fix at this point. My overall fishing as a whole has changed so much over the past few years especially as I finally got confident with the baitcaster Iâ€™m having less and less use for spinning reels.
1063817,JoshS,2020-07-02 16:39:00,729,"Same thing happened to me last time I took apart a stradic. I ended up sending into Shimano to figure it out lol. They'll probably fix you up for their $25 flat rate charge (if that's what it still is), you'll have to cover shipping to them. I've learned to leave spinning reels to the experts. Baitcasters do myself. So many small parts in a spinning reel!"
1063858,misfish,2020-07-03 21:27:00,29133,"Ok Take this as you want as this came to me, and woke me up from my sleep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   Take the reel apart again. Take pics and lay all the parts out on the table like in theÂ  schematics pic.  My thinking here is this,,,,,,,,,,,  Many parts are no longer availableÂ  , so they say,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Go through all parts putting it back together, STEP BY STEP and take pics or even a video .,,,,,,,,,,,,I have a thinking, someone or some reel guy, replaced a part with that spring. If you say the spring was part of the mix, well, I am thinking a sub part was put in .  Do the total break down and rebuild. I want to know what you come up with AK.     "
1063859,AKRISONER,2020-07-03 22:30:00,5558,You know what? Iâ€™m gonna do this and video it. Iâ€™ll at least take it apart as far as I did. I donâ€™t think I want to go beyond taking apart the worm gear etc. Iâ€™ll post the video to YouTube and see where we get
