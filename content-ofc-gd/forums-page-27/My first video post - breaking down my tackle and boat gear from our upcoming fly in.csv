This post breaks down my tackle bag (including in the boat gear) for our upcoming trip to Lake St Joseph with Slate Falls Outposts  Hoping its helpful to any one planning or heading out on a fly in fishing trip  https://www.northernjacks.com/post/tackle-and-boat-gear-from-my-fly-in-trio  Admins  - please let me know if this should go in non outdoor posts - to me its outdoors but fine to move going forward  Cheers  Andrew
