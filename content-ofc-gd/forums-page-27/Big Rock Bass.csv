I need to work a little with him on his camera aiming. What's everyones biggest Rock bass? I know the Ontario record is 17 inches and around 3 pounds.    "
1064654,Rizzo,2020-08-05 12:49:00,4754,"huge. We have a similar rock bass that lives under our dock. Poor bugger gets caught by the kids repeatedly but keeps coming back for more. They affectionately call him ""Rocky""...my kids don't have the best imagination"
1064659,ketchenany,2020-08-05 17:40:00,3229,"Nice catch, I took Â two of my grandkids at the Isabella StÂ Â pierÂ Â last Friday and they caught dinky perch."
1064660,AKRISONER,2020-08-05 17:43:00,5558,"simcoe to me consistently has the biggest rockbass I have ever seen. They are size of small largemouth its insane. Apparently they are delicious, our friends to the south are actually obsessed with them!"

1064673,LefroyFisherman,2020-08-05 21:12:00,602,"Kept one last week with some perch we caught, it wasn't too bad, not my favorite eating fish."
1064678,tomO,2020-08-05 22:21:00,363,They fight like crazyÂ for 2 seconds.
1064679,crappieperchhunter,2020-08-05 22:43:00,2582,"Agreed Brian. I have a MarinaÂ on Simcoe I fish crappie and perch latter in the fall, and we get hog rock bass too. Tried them once in late fall...mid November if I recall, and I actually liked them better then crappie. Never really kept many though because we always managed lots of perch which are my favourite. Tried them from the same marina other times of the year and did not like them near as much and I have tried them out of the Kawartha's in the summer and they are garbage, for my tastes anyway."
1064680,LefroyFisherman,2020-08-05 22:56:00,602,"I'm pretty sure every kid would call a Big Rock Bass, Rocky! lol"
1064685,bigugli,2020-08-06 01:43:00,6138,We've got some 14-15 inch rockies up in Nippissing in the past.

1064716,LefroyFisherman,2020-08-07 01:13:00,602,"Maybe I should, I have a bass and a perch replica lol, it was a beast."
