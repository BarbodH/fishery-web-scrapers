Local Dollarama had a full peg hook of 150 yard braid fishing line in 15 & 20 lb grey color, MAKO brand in red packaging. $4 a spool so I bought a couple of spools and threw them in for back up. Sure enough 1 rod needs to get respooled on day 1 so what the heck I threw on the Dollarama line and used with a flour leader to throw X-raps and crankbaits all week. Would never know it was dollar store line. Worked perfect and no line wear or color fade. Too good of a deal"
