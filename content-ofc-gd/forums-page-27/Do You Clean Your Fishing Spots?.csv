I know what with Covid no one wants to touch things outside currently, but in general,  How many people clean up their area or surrounding area while they are out fishing?  I wanted to check cause almost every fishing spot no matter where it is seems to be littered with drink bottles/cans and timmies/fast food wrappers. Also there always seems to be an abundance of leftover line just littering most spots.  My friends and I try to clean up the area and usually end of bringing a bag of garbage to throw out later. Does anyone clean up their fishing spots while they are there or before they leave?"
1063970,AKRISONER,2020-07-10 18:28:00,5558,"i try to remember bags but it is tough. I basically could bring an entire garbage bag full of garbage out every single time i go fishing which is pretty sad when you think about it. Gotta love the bank fisherman classic though, a pack of busch cans scattered, a few packs of canadian classic smokes and a styrofoam worm container. Every single person here thats river fished, knows exactly what I am talking about."
1064007,David Chong,2020-07-12 03:44:00,836,"Especially when shore fishing, always carry a bag to pick up garbage, fishing line etc. On the water always picking Styrofoam worm containers etc.!"
1064081,Dave Bailey,2020-07-14 23:38:00,1641,"Those beer cans weigh a lot less once they're empty, so why is it so difficult to carry them out? Here's sight that greeted me near Sudbury last weekend, and I had no bags with me:  Its time for radical approaches, like a minimum $1 deposit. ""BUT THAT MAKES THINGS TOO EXPENSIVE!"" No, it doesn't, because you only pay it once. You buy 12 beers for (pulls figure out of butt) $24. Deposit adds $12, for a total of $36. When you return the case of empties, your $12 deposit is returned, which you then apply to your next purchase. YOU ONLY PAY IT ONCE, FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE! You could make it cripplingly expensive to not return bottles and cans, but you only pay it once. ""But I broke a bottle!"" Fine, collect up the pieces, and as long as you can return (reaches for butt again) 90% of it, by weight, you still get credited. We really have to get this crap under control somehow."
1064082,knightfisher,2020-07-15 02:03:00,237,"When I fish from shore, I check for line and hooks and move them out of the way so my dogs are safe. I'm not there to clean up after some slobs. I've seen some who clean up, and the next day or two it's littered again. "
1064087,Garnet,2020-07-15 15:34:00,2056,"I go out of my way to embarrass slobs. People fishing at ganny bunch Timmy's garbage I just scoop them up with my net and drop in trash can . never say a word. In all my fishing club conservation project picking up others trash was lowest project. Telling people to pick up there  trash (signs) a #2 project. #1 Conservation project are things that wok for life, spawning shoals and fishways."
1064091,Cando,2020-07-15 17:55:00,90,"Me and my buddy clean up the places we fish. It is disgusting to see all the garbage that people leave. This year as extra bad. With the covid-19, there was everything from food and drink remains to human crap. They took the garbage can and toilet away. Even the dog crap wasn't picked up. This is right in the middle of a small town."
1064104,beandust,2020-07-16 23:56:00,2,"I do not mind others leaving their beer cans, I will pick them up, but before I do I crush them under my foot to put them in a bag. The beer store will take them back crushed as long as they can see that it is a beer can. 12 cans is still a $1.20 in my pocket tax free."
1064146,FishGuy3754,2020-07-18 18:45:00,23,Thanks for all the responses.  AKRISONER I know what you mean. see them all the time to with the busch and worm containers. Usually during trout fishing there's a pile hidden under some rocks.   Dave Bailey A radical approach is probably what it would take to even make a dent. even with the deposit people will still leave them around but then beandust would be able to make $12.00 instead lol
1064157,OhioFisherman,2020-07-19 00:45:00,6623,"I used to fish a lot of farm ponds on shore, I had a trash bag in my back pack as standard equipment. A deposit on cans and plastic bottles I would certainly support here."

Besides all the garbage left on the land and the vandalism to properties,  there's even been reports of people crapping on the front lawn of homeowners. https://www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/news/peterborough-region/2020/07/09/burleigh-falls-in-peterborough-county-closed-to-public-after-complaints.html#:~:text=Burleigh Falls in Peterborough County closed to public after complaints,-By Marissa Lentz&text=The Ministry of Natural Resources,the public until further notice.&text=Joe Ayotte said there were,enforcing the closure on Thursday. I'm fortunate to live only 2 miles from Burleigh Falls and the place is absolutely gorgeous and it's so hard to believe the way some people treat these beautiful spots and the more it continues the more spots will be closed off. How can anyone be such a jerk to intentionally destroy such a beautiful spot ?      "
