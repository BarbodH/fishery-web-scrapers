1064231,Gil Levesque,2020-07-21 23:18:00,103,Caught this walleye today on lake erie. Part of a nice limit of six! It had these things on all its fins! Looked to me like maybe lamprey larvae! Any guesses?  
1064233,Gil Levesque,2020-07-21 23:21:00,103,They were attached by a ...sucker like a leech and there was blood around the area!!

1064235,kickingfrog,2020-07-22 00:41:00,8333,Definitely not anything lamprey related.

1064734,sauce,2020-08-08 00:35:00,219,"My observations show that it's actually the opposite in southwestern Ontario. I catch walleye with leeches on them at the end of the season in March. I have never caught a walleye with a leech on it in the summer. I've found leeches on my waders after trout fishing in April. Never happened in the summer on the same river. There's a certain trout stream I won't fish without waders. The strain of leeches there find you fast.  Leeches like cold water. I'm pretty sure they seek it out, along with blood! I think the OP's fish came from deep water way below the thermocline. Probably very close to bottom.  And probably not very far from a depth change and some significant weed growth."
