Thought my wife and I might take the canoe up and do some fishing for the 5 hours that we'll have free. I'm not looking for any specific honey-holes, just general areas that might be good with a canoe. Was up there last week and there's a place to put into the canal at the end of Armour Road, but it might be a bit hectic with boat traffic, not sure. Had a run up to the north side of Peterborough today and before returning I checked out the extreme south end of Chemong, looks like a nice spot but I don't know about launches. Anyone have any info?  Thanks in advance!"

716176,lew,2012-07-19 20:07:00,12766,If your gonna be right in downtown Peterboro maybe have a look at Little Lake  on George St. Lots of parking in the area plus a few restaurants for when your finished fishing.  There's a marina right there but I have no idea if they'll charge for launching the canoe but even so it wouldn't be much.  Never fished Little Lake myself but it's a pretty spot and I've heard there's some good  fish in there.

716751,lew,2012-07-21 17:24:00,12766, What can we say
716770,Dave Bailey,2012-07-21 21:53:00,1641,"Well as the Bard of Ayrshire wrote, ""The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men gang aft agley..."" Circumstances intervened and prevented any watery excursions, I hope Meagen brings back some of whatever she was handing out samples of, I need a drink now."
