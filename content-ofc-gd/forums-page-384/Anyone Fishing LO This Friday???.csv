715970,Roy,2012-07-19 10:26:00,13728,"Winds are out of the NE Friday. In round numbers, Hamilton 25K, Toronto 20K and Whitby 15K. Would launching farther east help at all?"
715985,Live2fish85,2012-07-19 12:06:00,1633,"Not out there Roy with windd that higher the lake will be rough all over the Canada side.  THey have changed since though, nothing great but lets hope it changes again soon.  Sorry that is for us on the South side atleast."
715987,mike rousseau,2012-07-19 12:08:00,4661,  Perfect time to head east for musky or walleyes...Lol
715998,Pikeslayer,2012-07-19 12:38:00,1443,"You could still give Simon his introduction but make sure you bring a bucket on board  . Would make for an interesting Limey report.   Unfortunately Roy, the 'Ontario East Buoy' forecast/data looks no better. The winds have already shifted to easterlies here this morning and if the Sailflow forecast holds (and they're pretty darn accurate historically) with sustained easterlies through Saturday, we are in for some major 'fetch' winds/waves. Might be Sunday until the lake settles down.  An FYI for those who might not be 'in the know'. Roy's numbers above are in knots (K). 1 K = 1.852 km/h. Here's some info on 'fetch' winds/waves: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetch_%28geography%29"
715999,dave524,2012-07-19 12:39:00,4508,"Worse than losing a day due to rough conditions, we are going to have the west end fill up with warm water, especially Grimsby around to Bronte and the fish will be gone when it does flatten out"
716002,Pikeslayer,2012-07-19 12:40:00,1443," I will get there Mike. Realistically, it's looking like October."
716036,Billy Bob,2012-07-19 13:41:00,5865,"Wussy Canucks.......you are either fish or cut bait on shore.....  .........  Here's a site I use for Lake Erie and you can drag it over to Lake Ontario...you can get the wave report for that exact area in the lake by just clicking the cursor there....it really works only for USA waters but will direct you to a Canadian site if you click on your side of either lake....but I think it's best to just click on the USA side...try it, you might like it.....  http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=42.71170507522794&lon=-79.07272338867188&site=buf&unit=0&lg=en&FcstType=marine  Now go catch a nice big salmon......  ....doesn't look too bad for Sat/Sun"
716067,whiskywizard,2012-07-19 15:06:00,305," Agree 100% Simon.  I rely on Sailflow's numbers. They are more accurate than any other forecaster produces.  That forecast would keep me in Whitby harbour, or at the least, limited to running downwind quartering seas only. Dalhousie or 50 Point would be a pleasant destination. Cobourg or Rochester - not so much!"
716072,Pikeslayer,2012-07-19 15:12:00,1443, I am heading for safe haven on Sturgeon Lake on Saturday
716077,dave524,2012-07-19 15:14:00,4508," Don't look too pleasant at 50 Point  http://www.fpyc.ca/webcam/default.php  I'm 1 street off the lake here and can see it from the end of my drive, not good and building."
716081,blaque,2012-07-19 15:39:00,2419,Dont it just figure...im supposed to be heading out saturday morning on the south shore (U.S) near wilson harbor on a friends charter boat. Ahhh well
716084,BillM,2012-07-19 16:06:00,17367,E25km/h picking up to 30km/h in the afternoon.   No thanks.
716093,funfishing,2012-07-19 16:36:00,147,Buoy readings: http://www.erh.noaa.gov/buf/marine.htm  Lake Ontario text forecast: http://www.crh.noaa....GLF&issuedby=LO  THIS AFTERNOON...EAST WINDS 15 TO 25 KNOTS BECOMING NORTHEAST.WAVES 3 TO 5 FEET..

716102,Billy Bob,2012-07-19 16:57:00,5865,The worst part of this forecast is it will probably break up that nice thermoclime that is set up in about 100 feet of water and scatter the salmon.....
716126,BillM,2012-07-19 17:54:00,17367," The salmon are everywhere.  Guys catching them in 80 down 40 or out in 250 down 120..  No bang on patterns this year, that's for sure (At least in the north end of the lake)"
716197,Billy Bob,2012-07-19 21:06:00,5865," Lets just wait for the cold front to blow through and see.......it's that stable weather we have had for the last few weeks that set up a nice thermoclime.....it if blows hard and that breaks up, all bets are off on where to find any salmon."
716211,Pikeslayer,2012-07-19 21:55:00,1443," Yep. Got to agree with Bob. There is defined thermocline as of about 2 weeks ago and the salmon have found their preferred temp zones. All the big boys & girls are hitting between 42 & 46 F during daylight hours. That said, they will move into warmer water to feed @ dawn & dusk. This big blow will definitely scatter them for a few days until the TC settles back in.  Slayer"
716223,spincast,2012-07-19 22:32:00,3279,"You got it Pikeslayer - lake will be a mess and they will be scattered all over and the usual patterns likely wont produce.  Limey called today and I had to give him the bad news  . Sounds like the visit has been less than hoped for as well.  He is however heading to the Fish-a-thon (if everything works out) so all those in attendance will doubtless give him a warm welcome to SW Ontario. Please welcome him for me - unfortunately I cant attend (again) this year.  Frankie65 - $20 buck as per usual, and  another $20 bucks for you or Juli - whoever catches the biggest.  "
716224,krixxer,2012-07-19 22:36:00,274,Live update from my balcony:  stay home! Heavy swell I'd guess around 3 ft and a good chop A few whitecaps but they are all the way out as far as I can see Only 2 big sail boats on the water right now @ 6:30pm  
716312,GreenCanada,2012-07-20 04:45:00,375,I'm planning on hitting a pier tomorrow afternoon for a few hours. Hoping to pull in another chinny or steelhead. I'll update with a fishing report if all goes well.
716711,dave524,2012-07-21 11:53:00,4508,"Looks like a fine day out there, my big old weeping willow is hanging dead still here 200 yards off the lake and the weather buoy is saying waves .3 ft and winds very light out of the south.  http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=45139"
716714,spincast,2012-07-21 12:00:00,3279,Be there tomorrow - give the lake a day to recover and the west winds a chance to get some cooler water back to our side of the lake. http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/res/glcfs/glcfs.php?lake=o&ext=wv&type=F&hr=18  the above link is pretty cool as well - click through the hours across the top to see wave heights over the next couple days.
