716722,SirCranksalot,2012-07-21 12:56:00,3291,  Now there's a guy who knows how to cook(and eat) trout. And you're right about the skin when cooked too.   
716734,Rod Caster,2012-07-21 15:26:00,5784, Looks like he's just gobbling up every bit of fish haha. Too funny
716775,Leecher,2012-07-21 22:26:00,7832," Thanks Knuguy!!!  Nothing goes to waste that way, except the bones   Indeed Chad    and he's serious about it"
716782,danc,2012-07-21 23:06:00,4677,"Drooling here Jacques. That was my reward when creek fishing Brookies as a kid. It's just a memory now. The minimium keep size where I fish now is 22"". We get our fair share of legal fish every year, but I just can't fathom keeping one of them for the frying pan. Thanks for the memories, and the whet appetite!"
716798,Leecher,2012-07-22 00:04:00,7832," Thanks Dan!!! I wish the lake I fish had some of those 22""er but reality is, they don't last long... Every year it's stocked and the lake is very easy to access.... one just need to stop the car, get out and cast... doesn't necessary mean you'll catch them but you get the picture.  Up here, the big native brookie lakes are deep in the bush and one needs an ATV 4 wheel drive to get to them   I don't own any or boat, so this little pond is perfect for me    This is the third limit I get out of this lake in 4 years of fishing it from shore... I'm pretty happy about it"
716477,Leecher,2012-07-20 16:52:00,7832," Thanks Pikeslayer8!!!   I totally agree Chad   Who'd a thought      Perch will do Dave   Mind as well add beans to your breaky  to make it complete  Ummmm eggs, beans and perch... perfect combination   Don't be.... freshly caught fish is the best"
716482,Christopheraaron,2012-07-20 17:03:00,3525,And did I mention the fresh cod and ocean smelts and lobster?
716483,Leecher,2012-07-20 17:05:00,7832, Garlic butter and bacon goes real well with lobster
716485,misfish,2012-07-20 17:12:00,29133,"  You just ruined a perfect crustation.  Steam,crack and eat.      Don,t forget the kaplin,if you can find any."
716486,Christopheraaron,2012-07-20 17:14:00,3525," Don't talk like that! I may be able to eat it tomorrow, but I can't today! Also, did I mention the mussels?"
716488,Christopheraaron,2012-07-20 17:16:00,3525, What is that?
716492,Leecher,2012-07-20 17:35:00,7832, Just like fish fillets eh B?   Wine and tomato comes to mind for mussels   x2.... Tried to google it and can't find what it is?  some sort of shell fish
716493,misfish,2012-07-20 17:40:00,29133,Mis-spelled  http://www.coastalsafari.com/CAPELIN.htm
716495,Leecher,2012-07-20 17:44:00,7832, Ahhh I see    Thanks for the link B
716516,Christopheraaron,2012-07-20 18:24:00,3525,"Ya, I think I've confused those with smelt before, I've caught them while flounder fishing, they are amazing if you throw them into a frying pan with butter whole, eat them and enjoy the crunchyness of the bones!"
716517,Christopheraaron,2012-07-20 18:25:00,3525," And another shellfish ruined... my grandfather makes this amazing recipe for mussels, I'll get it from him tomorrow and tell you what it is."
716525,Leecher,2012-07-20 18:34:00,7832,"  My goodness    I feel bad    this, the second time I ruined good food  But no worries... I don't eat seafood and was just suggesting ingredients   in my mind would go great with those"
716526,Christopheraaron,2012-07-20 18:40:00,3525,"It's ok, we'll get through it together.... I picked up this course for you FCA (food challenged anonymous) www.FCA.com"
716534,Leecher,2012-07-20 18:53:00,7832, I get all my ideas from Food Network... my favorite show to watch
716539,misfish,2012-07-20 19:00:00,29133,"Drive in, diners, and dives."
716542,Leecher,2012-07-20 19:03:00,7832, Yeah B that's one of them   Guy Fietti is the dude
716544,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-07-20 19:05:00,310,"Oh yeah, that looks delicious. I always eat specks with nothing but butter and they are awesome. I'll add a touch of garlic next time. My 2 year old son eats them with his hands and he shoves them in his mouth as fast as he can just like cookie monster. I went out last night for some creek brookies and then for some walleye. I can't wait to see what my little guy prefers: brookies of walleyes. I know that he loves specks and eyes but tonight he'll have both in his plate so I'm looking forward to see what he really prefers."
716548,Leecher,2012-07-20 19:20:00,7832, Thanks Walleye'm Fishing!!! That should be interesting to see which he prefers most   Let us know the outcome
716568,Christopheraaron,2012-07-20 20:13:00,3525," Watching it right now, now I have to visit detroit!"
716577,misfish,2012-07-20 20:26:00,29133,"I,m fond of Eat Street these days. Some great food. Waiting for that big truck with cooked specks and venison nuggets,drizzeled with hot sauce."
716582,Leecher,2012-07-20 20:54:00,7832,Yeah it's a good show for sure!   If you see that truck B... let me know
716587,misfish,2012-07-20 21:00:00,29133, :rofl2:
716594,Rod Caster,2012-07-20 21:30:00,5784, One guy in north bay serves perch at his chip truck. Mike near the Fifth wheel truck stop.
716622,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-07-20 23:45:00,310,"The results are in...   He loves both brookies and eyes but prefers ''du dor√©'' or walleye.   After he cleaned out his plate, he stole mine. "
716637,Leecher,2012-07-21 00:19:00,7832, That's awesome Walleye'm Fishing  I can understand him preferring walleye over specks... loved the last pic where he raids your plate    Cute kid!!!
716149,Leecher,2012-07-19 19:06:00,7832,"For those that miss my last report, my Bro-in-law and I were able to get each a limit of speckle trout   You can peruse it at your leasure here:  The Specks were on Fire  Buttered pan seared papillon speckle trout    Enjoy!  First Garlic Salt, touch a salt & pepper    Spreading them out like butterfly    Turning them once    My reward    Tight lines TJunkie"
716151,NAW,2012-07-19 19:10:00,4022,"Mouth watering.  I like your style.  Nothing fancy, just some fish in a pan."
716152,misfish,2012-07-19 19:10:00,29133,"Looks good buddy,but I hate bones and skin. Im a shovel it in,kinda guy.LOL  Nicely done."
716153,asdve23rveavwa,2012-07-19 19:15:00,2690,"  I usually am too, Brian, but, the skin on specks is amazing and, when cooked properly, you can just pull those bones right out in one piece!  Looks fantastic Jacques!!!!!!"
716155,Joey,2012-07-19 19:23:00,9122,"Well now I'm hungry  Looks absolutely delish.  Reminds me of how I used to cook the bows from the rivers I caught in the mountains in Alberta.  Right on the open fire, cast iron skillet, butter, salt and pepper and a bit of garlic salt!!!!   Right on"
716157,Leecher,2012-07-19 19:24:00,7832," Nick, this was the way my mom always cook trout and it's how I always have them   Thanks!!!   I think filets is what you prefer and can understand but this way there is no waste     Thanks B!!!   Exactly Frankie     Thanks!!!"
716161,Leecher,2012-07-19 19:26:00,7832," Thanks Joey!!!  Butter, salt & pepper and a little of garlic salt is the perfect combination"
716162,misfish,2012-07-19 19:28:00,29133,"LOL   Trust me bud,I waste nothing.My plate is always bare,when Im done."
716166,Leecher,2012-07-19 19:33:00,7832," LOL By waste, I meant, that filleting a fish you always leave the most tasteful meat along the bones... this way you get to savour the little bit left behind"
716169,Christopheraaron,2012-07-19 19:56:00,3525,"Mouth watering, Tears streaming, Too good to be true!"
716173,Leecher,2012-07-19 20:05:00,7832, Part 2 coming soon   5 more to go
716177,fishnsled,2012-07-19 20:08:00,3520,That is probably that best way to cook those tasty gems. BTW - I'll need a new keyboard with all the drooling going on here.
716181,Leecher,2012-07-19 20:15:00,7832," Sure is Will   Come on up this way, I have 5 more and then we can go get some more me and you"
716182,fishnsled,2012-07-19 20:18:00,3520, What weekends work for you??
716183,Leecher,2012-07-19 20:21:00,7832, Any weekend works for me Will   Just let me know ahead of time and we good to go
716184,Christopheraaron,2012-07-19 20:24:00,3525,"Well, if we are just inviting ourselves over.... LOL!"
716220,Leecher,2012-07-19 22:28:00,7832, You mind as well come on up Christopher... The more the marrier
716229,Rod Caster,2012-07-19 23:11:00,5784,That's how we cook 'em in algonquin park. Sans the garlic however. Enjoy mon frere
716230,Leecher,2012-07-19 23:16:00,7832, Merci mon chum!!! You bet    Garlic is a must.... just a little sprinkle does it   Better than walleye I might add   Can't get enough of them   Now I can go and fetch some more
716233,Christopheraaron,2012-07-19 23:39:00,3525, You're killing me here! maybe some time ahh...
716235,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-19 23:47:00,336,Nice cooking form!
716242,Rod Caster,2012-07-20 00:10:00,5784," Thems fightin' words haha just kidding, I totally agree. Those little pan fryers are like swimming candy. Who would have guessed that a diet of insects and worms would produce such a nice flavor."
716363,bigcreekdad,2012-07-20 12:36:00,546,"I'm mostly a catch and release guy, but I am suddenly quite hungry!!"
716369,Fish Farmer,2012-07-20 12:45:00,2234,"Please stop. Now you've made me go to my freezer looking for some fish for breakfast, and I don't have Specks,   just Perch and eggs for me.   Man those Specks look MMMMMMM Good."
716435,Christopheraaron,2012-07-20 15:29:00,3525,"Alright, I'm still jealous that you can do that so easily an hour from your house, but starting tomorrow I'll be able to dine on freshly caught striped bass, flounder, pickeral, perch and yes of course SPECKS!!"
