Think about it.If you were sitting in your living room,and a bear came in,what would you think then??????????? Me,what the hell are you doing here? Shouldnt you be in the bush? LOL"
716547,misfish,2012-07-20 19:10:00,29133,"Hey Pete,lets go fishing."
716550,lew,2012-07-20 19:24:00,12766," I always find it kind of ironic that people think it's perfectly fine to kill all the animals they want for sport, but as soon as an animal kills a human everybody wants it destroyed cause it's dangerous.  Sorta like everyone says to destroy all the cormorants cause their eating too many fish, but when a fisherman goes out and catches a boat full of fish, everyone congratulates him and says what a great fisherman he is.  Kinda funny really."
716551,jimmer,2012-07-20 19:24:00,2730,The cancellation of the spring bear hunt was definitely an ethical decision with no biological reasons. The whole effort to cancel was supported by big city dollars.
716553,Live2fish85,2012-07-20 19:30:00,1633,I appologize for that then. I was mis informed I guess and will gladly admit that.  I still don't agree that it stop bears from being a nuisance.
716555,ctranter,2012-07-20 19:40:00,543,"Funny that facts were being brought up so I checked some facts which I found really amusing.  According to a wiki page on bear related deaths, there have been 19 black bear deaths in North American since 2000.  There is about one or two every few years across the entire continent.  There are more grizzly deaths, mind you, but that's a different issue.  Now the scary part, cows viciously destroyed 108 people in the United States between 2003-2007 alone!.. An average of 21.6 deaths-by-cow in the US every year.  What is the solution to this madness?  HUNTING TIME!  Now I know you will just reply with some lame, pseudo-insulting jab about how I must be a tree-hugging deer lover, but I hunt annually for a variety of species, including bear.  The solution isn't the spring hunt (or crying about big city politics), it's to understand how to coexist in nature, with the extremely rare chance of encountering a bear   http://bookofodds.com/Accidents-Death/Accidental-Deaths/Articles/A0252-Behind-the-Numbers-Death-by-Cow  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fatal_bear_attacks_in_North_America#2000s"

716480,jedimaster,2012-07-20 16:56:00,3472," That's the point. The number of constant nuisance bears is on a dramatic rise due to the increase in population. The spring bear hunt more effectively controls the population to reduce these. Why does it matter if they are harvested in the fall or spring. I don't understand how if more bear will be harvested in the spring is a bad thing if the population is increasing to the point where there are an increasing number of nuisance bears that you agree that you want ""dealt"" with. By dealt you must mean harvest, as relocation is proven many many times over to not work."
716484,Terry,2012-07-20 17:06:00,14456,"Gerald Marois heard the bear before he saw it.  “I turned around and he was about 50 feet away — one of the biggest bears I had ever seen in my life.  “He looked at me and moved sideways a bit, I start backing up and he just charged me. He came full blast, man.”  Marois, 47, a retired steelworker and experienced hunter from Waubaushene, was mauled by a large black bear last Tuesday evening in a remote wooded area about 30 km northwest of Orillia.  He was airlifted to Sunnybrook hospital, where he gave the Star an exclusive and terrifying account of his near-death encounter.  Marois was planting a food plot in a small clearing about 150 feet inside the bush line, where he planned to hunt deer in the fall — “My Dad taught me that’s where you get the big buck” — when the bear came up from behind him.  “His head was huge, his eyes were really far apart from each other and he had tiny, tiny ears, which is the sign of a huge boar — probably 600 pounds.”  When the bear charged, Marois said he turned around and ran toward a nearby oak tree — “The one I wanted to put my tree-stand in” — and climbed three-quarters of the way up.  The bear followed him up.  Marois shakes as he tells the story from his hospital bed, his arms, legs and face covered in deep gashes.  Marois said he tried to fight the bear off from the trees upper branches, but it kept coming up after him.  “I was hitting him on the nose and on the head, trying to hurt him, and every time I hit him he was scraping me and just pulling on my boots.”  The bear pulled one of his boots off and started biting the bottom of his feet.  “Then he dragged me almost to the ground.”  Marois tried and tried to get away from the bear by climbing farther up the tree, but the bear repeatedly dragged him down.  “I was kicking him with the other boot and he grabbed that boot and he ripped it right off.”  The bear then tried to rip off Marois’s chest waders.  “That was messing him up, because they were coming back like an elastic, eh? And it was hard for him to rip them off.”  But the bear eventually got them.  “Then he started eating my flesh.”  Marois said he watched as the bear started eating into his right calf.  “He was eating my meat and he was licking the blood and licking himself and just enjoying every bite of it.  Marois suffered his worst injuries to his legs, which required a skin graft to repair. They look torn apart and scrawny when he lifts up his hospital gown.  “He ate my whole calf.”  Marois says he made at least 10 attempts to climb away from the bear and it kept coming after him.  “I was trying to get away from him in every direction that I could in that oak tree, but he kept on dragging me down; he wanted me down on the ground.”  Marois, who said he forgot his bear spray at home, then turned to the only weapon he had.  “I got my lighter out” — a regular cigarette lighter — “and I started burning his face.”  Marois said when he shoved the lighter in the bear’s face it clawed him in the head.  “And that was it with the lighter, eh? No more lighters.”  Proof of the bear’s swipe comes in the two long rows of stitches on the top and side of Marois’s head.  “I got really weak from that hit. I had barely nothing left, so I told God I was putting my life in his hands.”  He said he prayed to God to send his guardian angel to protect him, because he couldn’t fight the bear off any longer.  At that moment, the bear threw Marois from the tree — Marois figures about 20 feet — and he landed with a thud and a loud groan.  When he looked up he watched the bear dive out of the tree in the opposite direction.  “It seemed like God scare him, man. People don’t believe in God, but I’m telling you, man, something scare him. Because he got scared, he jumped in the rough and he took off.”  Marois said the attack definitely lasted more than 15 minutes, though he says it “felt like forever.”  But he knew he still wasn’t safe.  He heard the bear roaming around him, gnashing his teeth and making a guttural barking noise Marois called a “bawl” — the same noise it made before charging at him.  “I was sure I was dead. I told God, ‘Keep your hand over me, protect me.’”  Marois called his wife and then 911, but the rescue team and emergency crews couldn’t find him in the thick bush.  It took rescuers — with the help of Marois’ wife, Louise Beauchamp — more than an hour to find him. All the while Marois could hear the bear nearby.  Eventually the rescuers found him, and with Marois’s legs ripped to shreds, they moved him to a clearing where the air ambulance helicopter could land.  “That’s when I finally could breathe.”  The next thing Marois remembers is waking up in the hospital.  Marois’ health has been improving every day, but doctors tell him he may need plastic surgery to fix his legs. He says he has nightmares about the attack every time he sleeps.“It’s extremely hard for me to rest.”  Though he sometimes struggles to tell the story, Marois speaks angrily about the cancellation of the spring bear hunt in Ontario more than 10 years ago.  “I want (Premier Dalton McGuinty) to reconsider the spring bear hunt, so this doesn’t happen no more.”  Mike Harris’s provincial government ended the spring bear hunt in 1999 after it had been in place for 30 years. Critics called the spring hunt “barbaric” because it often left behind thousands of orphaned cubs. All other Canadian provinces with bears have spring hunts except Nova Scotia. Ontario still has a fall bear hunt, which starts in September.  A spokesman for Ontario’s Ministry of Natural Resources said Friday that they thought the bear may have mistaken Marois — bent over and wearing chest waders — as a deer.  But Marois believes the bear was tracking him.  “He didn’t mistake me for nothing. That bear wanted to maul me; he was hungry and he came to get me.”  The ministry says bear encounters are not on the rise in the province, but Marois says he and his neighbours have seen different.  “We live up north, the bear are coming in our town, in our kids’ schoolyard. They walk the streets with their babies.  “I want the population of Toronto to be aware that they’re not scared of us. They roam the forest and if they’re hungry, they’ll get you, man. There’s nothing you can do about it.”  Marois said his rescuers — a combination of OPP officers, paramedics and Port Severn firefighters — risked their lives entering the bush the way they did, not knowing if the bear was still in the area.  “I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart.”  Marois, who has been living in the Waubaushene area for more than 20 years, comes from a hunting family in rural Quebec.  “I was born with a rabbit snare and a pellet gun in my hands.”  But now he says he may never hunt again.  “It will be really hard to go back in the bush after this.”  "

Colorado shooting victim survived Toronto Eaton Centre shooting  20/07/2012 12:01:00 PM  Matthew Coutts A woman killed when a gunman opened fire in a Colorado movie theatre had survived Toronto's recent Eaton Centre shooting and wrote in a blog that she was ""blessed"" to have survived the first incident.  A woman killed when a gunman opened fire in a Colorado movie theatre had survived Toronto's recent Eaton Centre shooting and wrote in a blog that she was ""blessed"" to have survived the first incident.  Jessica Ghawi was among 12 people shot dead early Friday morning when gunfire erupted at a midnight screening of Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colo.  Jordan Ghawi confirmed to San Antonio TV station Kens5 that his sister was killed in the attack. Ghawi had recently moved from Texas to Colorado to pursue a career in sports broadcasting.  Ghawi wrote and tweeted about hockey under the name Jessica Redfield.  In her last blog post, dated June 5, 2012, Redfield wrote in great detail about her experience shopping at the Eaton Centre moments before gunfire rung out, killing two people and injuring several others.  ""Who would go into a mall full of thousands of innocent people and open fire? Is this really the world we live in?"" she wrote.  According to the post, Redfield was at the mall to get sushi and go shopping during a vacation to Toronto. She stepped outside just moments before gunfire erupted.  ""I was on a mission to eat sushi that day, and when I'm on a mission, nothing will deter me. When I arrived at the Eaton Center mall, I walked down to the food court and spotted a sushi restaurant,"" Redfield wrote.  ""Instead of walking in, sitting down and enjoying sushi, I changed my mind, which is very unlike me, and decided that a greasy burger and poutine would do the trick.  ""I rushed through my dinner. I found out after seeing a map of the scene, that minutes later a man was standing in the same spot I just ate at and opened fire in the food court full of people. Had I had sushi, I would've been in the same place where one of the victims was found.""  Redfield wrote that she had a funny feeling after eating and decided to head outside for some fresh air instead of shopping at the nearby SportChek.  ""The gunshots rung out at 6:23. (sic) Had I not gone outside, I would've been in the midst of gunfire,"" she wrote.  Redfield stayed near the mall and watched as paramedics rushed a young, shirtless boy into an ambulance. She said the moment eventually overtook her, and she was left feeling nauseous.  ""My mind keeps replaying what I saw over in my head. I hope the victims make a full recovery. I wish I could shake this odd feeling from my chest,"" her post concluded.  ""The feeling that's reminding me how blessed I am. The same feeling that made me leave the Eaton Center. The feeling that may have potentially saved my life.""  Tributes to the young sportscaster came across Twitter on Friday.  The You Can Play Project, a program founded by the son of Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Brian Burke, said she was working there as an intern.  ""We will miss her intelligence, kindness and work ethic greatly,"" they wrote on Twitter.  Moments before Friday morning's shooting in Colorado, Redfield exchanged tweets with Sporting News NHL writer Jesse Spector, teasing him for missing the early showing of the highly-anticipated Batman movie.  ""Words are useless. Guns more so. If you ever had any interaction with @JessicaRedfield, you know the world is much worse off without her,"" Spector tweeted on Friday."

The point terry posted was very uncommon and as it is sad I don't think the guy knows what the bear was thinking. I do know that running up a tree is one of the worst things you can do. When he did that bear probably though food as he ran.  John post shows some thing that we see way to often. Remember 4 killed this week and a bit in 3 shootings. Plus the mall a month or so ago.

Since the cancellation of the spring bear the estimated population of bears has increased a tremendous amount. This has caused bears to have a lack of food in the forests. They get pushed out in search of food and look for food in towns, and cities. There range encroaches more and more on the human populations every year. This has resulted in an increase in nuisance bears. This increase in nuisance bears gives more opportunity for something bad to happen. Attacks, maulings, property damage etc... Relocating nuisance bears does NOT work. The Bear hunters are the only thing that keeps the bear population in check. The spring bear hunt is the most effective time for that to happen in terms of numbers for population as well as meat quality for the hunters.  There will always be nuisance bears and there always have been. However not in the numbers there have been since the cancellation of the spring bear hunt.  You can choose to ignore these facts that have been referenced and quoted in this thread from reputable sources if you want. It doesn't change that they are facts.  I presume you will choose to reply back with a quip of how you are a man and not afraid of bears. or they are cute and cuddly and you have never been attacked or that there are street gangs shooting people, or some other ludicrous statement. But I would think it would be worth sitting for a few moments and reading the facts before responding."

I if I lived up north I wouldn't let my 5 year old outside with out my supervision. If I did it would be because there is a fence there. We have seen bears in Kkllbear when I was a kid I didn't freak out and my parents didn't let me they taught me. Kids are smarter then you think and if you don't let a 5 year old run in an open backyard unattended you would be fine.  Most bears won't attact a human unless it is startled or something. I have spent alot.of.time in the north seen lots of bears and never been or had problems with you. Using your brain can go a long ways.  You guys say bring back the spring hunt because there are more bears, really that haven't had to many bear attacks this year or last few that I have heard of. The bear in Burlington was shot as they didn't want to wait lol, did it attack anyone or cause any harm no.  It just would have cost to much to relocate it.  Bear really doesn't taste good. I have had it and it is very lean , hard yo cook well and doesn't taste great. Most people just want the fur from it and to say they shot a massive bear.  I would be agreeing if you wanted to shot all these crackheads and scum that hurt people everyday for a couple bucks or cause they wear a different colour shirt or gang clothing.

You are being pretty unrealistic to say kids are never outside by themselves. And this is not just up north. No offense, I am far more likely to be comfortable with my kids in site of me outside up north than I am in Toronto.  I guess your right though we should treat all animals with respect and never kill or harm them for food or sport either. I mean you say that there is NO danger to humans because bad things don't happen. So it must just all be for fun right? Kind of like fishing? You better sell all your fishing gear and never go fishing then, because after all whats the differenece between jabbing a steel fishing hook through a fishes mouth and jerking it out of the water where it can't breathe and holding it in the sun to bake while you take a picture of it for sport, only to just kill it and eat it, or throw it back in the water. I doubt anyone would be OK with taking a grappling hook to a bears mouth and dragging it under water for a few minutes while it thrashes around gasping for air so you can get a nice picture of it, only to rip the hook out of its mouth and let go back into the woods."
716437,capt bruce,2012-07-20 15:30:00,820,"The ending of the spring hunt was just wrong . Most bear hunting in ontario is done over bait , this said (my first hunt was a spring bear when I was 13 with my grandad , damn was I so proud to bring home the meat for the family) so do not tell me mothers with cubs were taken , not hard to tell a male bear from a female with cubs when hunting this way . Fall bear is very fatty  , lean spring bear is great tasteing and healthy eating. We outlaw pitbull like dogs ?? but bears , oh how cute theres a bear , or Im a man ""me no afraid of no BEAR "" . Sad when my neibor can feed bears in his backyard but DO not own a bulldog type dog... only in CANADA , a country that was built on the trapping , forestry etc.  industrys , now its the hug a bear , tree ,porcupine , rattlesnake what ever , you bear lovers , love them all you want hopefully they will be eating you . and leave me alone .."

It only makes sense that if there was a bear around it would be quickly dispatched. Big city life...you get what you ask for. I'd still rather deal with angry bears than angry gangs Nuissance bears up here go unreported and smothered in BBQ sauce.   Since the MNR is reportedly out of money, I don't think they really care or know about a few missing, garbage eating bears."

I won't even bother with the lack of brains on that comment.  There are alot of better tasting animals then bear.  I am not against hunting and I love eating wild game, I don't agree with morons saying "" they see more so they need to shoot them"". That was why they stopped the bear hunt to bring them back. All you really care about is the fur. Things are different now then 50 years ago food is easy to get now, there are plenty of other animals to eat and if.your hurting that bad to eat now the government will help. I have no problem with the fall bear hunt, go for it and have fun. But if you guys want to keep hunting them putting the spring hunt on and you won't have them soon enough."
716452,John,2012-07-20 15:58:00,2956," I guess living in the big city you realize that you and your family are in greater danger from your own city folk that you ever are spending a week in close proximity to those mean, vicious, human killer bears......... There are more people killed and injured every year in Southern Ontario as innocent victims of incidental gunfire (being in the wrong place at the wrong time), than there are from ALL wildlife encounters combined. We have more rogue freaked out humans per square mile than bears.......  So if one gets in between a mother and her cub that is cause to destroy the mother? Hell if you got between me and my child and started to pose a perceived threat I would tear your balls off first and ask questions later..........just sayin'...  OK I like this one....""a bear that associated human presence with food""! Don't feed the dang' bears!!!!!!!!!!!! Put food away, leave your campsite free of food scraps....Would you scrape food scraps on the dining room floor after your meal, would ya??? Probably not.  So, how many bears would you think we would need to ""cull"", (kill), every Spring to solve the problem? 100, 1000, 10,000, 100,000??? This is a recent phenomenon.....think about why the bears are encroaching on ""OUR"" properties. Maybe because ""WE"" use their's for recreation? Maybe because we build on their forage areas? Do you have any statistics, accurate ones, not just ""we see more bears therefore there are more bears"", that show the bear population today compared to say 25, 50 ,75 years ago?  How many incidents do you think there are every year regarding dogs attacking humans?? Maybe a Spring dog hunt will solve the problem?  Use common sense, practice cleanliness around your cottage, trailer, campsite. Teach your children well, bring them up with a strong respect for wildlife........not as tree huggers, but as one's responsible for their actions."

716459,ctranter,2012-07-20 16:12:00,543,"Wow, I am genuinely surprised at some of the fearful responses here.  Some of you guys clearly need to spend more time in the bush if you are that scared of a black bear.  It is a wild animal that demands respect.  After that, it follows the same rules of the animal kingdom as the rest of nature:  Eat easy meals, spend as little energy as possible acquiring that food, avoid risk or danger at all costs, make babies and protect babies.  I understand that animals do cross over into more urban spaces from time to time and thats why people with guns have to take them out.  What I don't understand is a) why people are shocked to find wild animals WHILE IN THE WILD and  why people think bears are bloodthirsty meat-fiends who will tear down your cabin door in the middle of the night and eat your girlfriend while making you watch...  Seriously people, get that lump between your shoulders check out, because clearly something is missing inside."
716460,jedimaster,2012-07-20 16:13:00,3472,"So you think that in a campsite where there are 300 sites separated by what 3 feet of treeline that if your site is clean everything will be fine? What about your house? rofl that's so funny. A bear will surely look at my clean yard and the fact that I have no bird seed out and will just walk around the block.  Yes the stats are everywhere that suggest the bear population is gaining ground steadily or rapidly and that there are more and more encounters with bears every day than there were prior. Here is a source, and there is a quote from a different source.  http://www.ontarioblackbears.com/ "
716461,blarg,2012-07-20 16:13:00,289,"I get a kick out of the usual comments that we are invading their space, we are just as much part of the natural world as the bear."
716462,DRIFTER_016,2012-07-20 16:18:00,10439, I alos do a lot of camping in bear country and while I'm not scared of them I have a healthy respect for them. Twice I have had large grizzlies sniffing at my tent in the middle of the night. I don't care who you are but that will unnerve anyone.  Last year my friend was tenting in the site beside me and he had one pushing in on the side of his tent in the middle of the night. He hauled off and punched it in the nose as hard as he could!! It went away an beat up on my other friends trailers because it was all ticked off. LOL
716463,jedimaster,2012-07-20 16:22:00,3472,"I don't think ANYONE has suggested that all the bear be culled. You guys are pretty funny. Protect the bear's and leave it alone, its cute and cuddly, but let me go fishing and pull fish around by there jaws with a shard of steel. Makes me laugh a bit. I don't think anyone here has said they are afraid of a bear. however there are some realities when living in Bear country. and I used to live with bears around us frequently for a number of years. The Feeling of every single one of my neighbours was if a bear stays in the woods, fine. If it comes into town repeatedly it gets put down. The spring bear hunt encourages more hunters to help control the population. It happens in the fall regardless. So why not have it when it encourages the best numbers of hunters to help control the population to safer and sustainable limits. If there was a population concern of not enough than they would have a lottery like deer. (Only X number of bears here or there). The fact is the MnR knows there are too many that's why anyone with a hunting license can go shoot a bear regardless of how many others are also doing the same.  If there were all of a sudden no limits on say Walleye in Pigeon. What would that tell you? I think it would tell me that there are too many walleye in Pigeon Lake."
716466,DRIFTER_016,2012-07-20 16:27:00,10439,The biggest thing hunting does is teach the bears to be wary of humans. Since they have not been pursued with the same intensity since the spring bear hunt ended they have grown bolder and lost their fear of humans. This coupled with the increase in population is causing the issue.  The spring bear hunt was not cancelled because the bear population was crashing (it was stable) it was cancelled by antis blackmailing Southern & Southwestern Ontario politicians during an election year. These antis told the politicians in power that their votes would go to the opposition unless the hunt was cancelled.  I'm not a bear hunter but I won't hesitate to shoot one that is acting agressively. My firearm comes camping with me just in case.
716467,Live2fish85,2012-07-20 16:29:00,1633,  I am always cautious and have full respect for any wildlife. Having a Grizzly near you and a black bear are two different stories. I would crap my pants if I had a Grizzly that close lol. I still don't think we need to kill them like others think.
716468,jedimaster,2012-07-20 16:33:00,3472, I would be willing to bet that if you were sitting on one side of your camp ground and your daughter on the other and a black bear walked through your camp site in between you and your child you would think a bit differently.
716469,Live2fish85,2012-07-20 16:34:00,1633,Also Jedi if you read my second.comment on here you will.see that I said if the bear is a constant nuisance then has to be dealt with. I just don't agree with killing them because we see more.
716470,Billy Bob,2012-07-20 16:35:00,5865," The hunters are not saying to KILL ALL THE BEARS...but rather HARVEST the bears in the spring time again......it worked back then, why not now."
716474,Live2fish85,2012-07-20 16:44:00,1633," I don't think that it was cancelled purely because of politics, I remember my grandfather telling me it was that there populations were decreasing. I am not against hunting bear but there have been more sightings which is great. Teach people how to respect them and properly act when encountering them.  There really isn't more attacks know that you hear of, when you do it was usually startled or provoked some how. Which has always been the case.  If your worried about something getting worst go to toronto and kill some scum, kind of like the 3that happened in Toronto this past week and a bit. Really these bears cause a bit of a nuisance and lets bring the spring bear hunt back. Yet these clowns run around toronto shooting everyone because they got a problem with one person.  If your so worried about your kids lets deal with a real problem."
716475,Millhouse2020,2012-07-20 16:46:00,152,"  X2, the hunt was cancelled because it was an easy target for anti hunting groups who want to take hunting rights away.  They used emotion and false information to get people on board their cause.  I remember them showing videos of poachers shooting bears treed or cornered by dogs...  this is not how bears are hunted in Onatrio.  Furthermore, they tried to paint baiting as an un-sporting way to hunt bears but anyone who is a hunter understands baiting is necessary to properly asses the bear for its sex before harvesting it.  If you think these anti groups pose no threat to you and your fishing rights, I seem to recall a nice billboard on the Gardiner with ""Fishing sucks.com"" on the banner and a pic of a dog with a lure in his mouth.  They're are out there, they are persistent and creative and some wont be happy untill we can't hunt or fish AT ALL in my opinion.   I have noticed a rise in the bear population in my region in northern ON since they cancelled the hunt.  There are far more bears around and naturally more become nuisance bears.  Hunting is and should be used as a wildlife management tool.  When the spring hunt was taken away, less bears are harvested which means there are more left in the bush, its simple math.  Lots of hunters, including myself, are busy pursuing other game through the fall so we hunt bears little or not at all but we would if there was a spring hunt.  Furthermore, lots of non-residents hunted bear during the spring via guide services.  Their livelihoods were hurt by this decision as well.  I dont think anyone is suggesting that we should fear every bear, or that culling bears is the solution.  Use hunting, including the spring hunt, to better manage the number of bears in the province.  There are clearly more than enough to support the spring hunt.  It would bring revenues in to the province in liscense fees and to rural communities for guiding services, accomodations etc and there would be fewer nuisance bears over time.  Of this you can be certain.  Right now, you have money wasted on relocating bears and many bear encounters being unreported since the locals simply killed the problem animal.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why this is a better solution than having a spring hunt.  Rest assured many bears are being killed by people who feel they have no other options, I know of many personally...  In my opinion, reinstating a spring hunt would help reduce the number of problem animals, bring revenue into the province and give sportsman more opportunities to enjoy their sport.  What is so wrong with that???"
716280,jedimaster,2012-07-20 01:58:00,3472,"Spring bear hunt is the solution to bear population control. Nothing will happen on that front until someone in a city gets mauled or killed. Cidiots tend to feel that if you live north of highway 7 and a bear kills you its because you are on its turf. A bear meanders into oakville and the swat team is called in. That happens up north and the answer is light a firecracker and scare it away. Seriously shake your head. When a bear kills a human they don't die from the initial attack. They are eaten piece by piece, until they bleed to death. Awake the entire time. A bear will rarely in an attack kill instantly. Every occourance I have heard about the person is partially mutilated with limbs chewed off, face, arms and legs eaten and digested while they are attatched to the person as they are awake and lucid. Skin, flesh and organs ripped from the bone. Sorry for being so visual but its the truth. Throw a firecracker at a returning nuisance bear? Not by me. Unless its attatched to the end of a 180 grain 30-06 bullet. Now this isn't to say that attacks happen allot, as we all know this is not the case. I can tell you this without any uncertainty that when it does happen its not something you want to be around, have happen to or even hear the details.  A bear that associates food with humans is a bear that needs to be harvested. They can't be relocated as they will return for several hundred km's. This was proven by the MnR with algonquin park nuisance bears. Putting it down is the only safe answer here.  Just my opinion of course."
716281,Fisherman,2012-07-20 02:03:00,7201,"Right on Jedi.. Ate pulled bear once, just as good as pulled pork."
716285,jedimaster,2012-07-20 02:25:00,3472,And in case anyone thinks I am kidding or stretching the truth. Don't forget what happened in 2010...  http://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/article/813758--mauling-victim-gives-chilling-account-of-bear-attack 
716287,Dave Bailey,2012-07-20 02:29:00,1641," Perhaps, but it also gave the animal rights people a tearjerking cause to take to the public. When bears are hunted in the spring it quite often means that the young are left to fend for themselves before they are quite old enough, and they can starve. They were taking that issue to the public, if I recall correctly, and it was rather easy to win them over. In my opinion (and keep in mind that I'm not a hunter) it was a good idea for sportsmen to cede that part of it in order to keep a hunt at all. But the question I have is this: did the ministry increase the number of bears that can be taken in the fall? As far as I know they didn't, which seems stupid. Count the average number that were taken in the spring and add it to the amount allowable in the fall, problem solved."
716290,jedimaster,2012-07-20 02:38:00,3472,"The problem with hunting bear in the Fall is they are much fatter and the meat is not as good eating. This puts some people off. As well bear hunting is down on the list of most peoples priority. The Fall Bear hunt overlaps with other seasons that are far more popular, Deer, Moose and Bird hunting. Not as many hunters are willing to go bear hunting as it means they have to give up one of those three. Less hunters, means less bears. It doesn't matter how many tags they assign. And to my understanding there is NO  lottery for bear. This means that everyone that wants to hunt bear in the fall can hunt bear in the fall.  As mentioned the problem is not the availability of hunting bear, its the feasibility and the time of year.  I don't know many hunters that hunt for trophy, most if not all hunt for the meat. The best time to encourage bear hunting is two fold. A> when there are no other hunting oppourtunities B> When the meat is at its prime tasting  I would rather have 350 pounds of lean Bear in my freezer than 450 pound of fatty bear.  As for Cubs being left alone to die this is also a misnomer as almost everyone that hunts hunts with the the hopes of targetting a male. They are typically about 30% larger than females. If anyone is concerned about stranded cubs, than pass it so that if you shoot a female (sow) with a cub you are also required to harvest the cubs if possible.believe me, a sow with cubs will not be far away."
716293,danc,2012-07-20 02:45:00,4677,"If you havent noticed by now, I down play bear sightings. I've been living and camping in bear infested woods for over 40 years. I've been face to face with them from 5 feet away. Sure, some common sense and caution is needed, but I've never been afraid of them. In fact I enjoy and look forward to my encounters with them. They are a nusience at best, but nothing that should strike the fear of God into you. I often camp in areas where there is bear scat and tracks all over the road on the drive in. Not to mention the physical sightings. A couple of years ago I saw 7 bears on my drive in, within a half mile of where I was tenting. Didn't phase me at all. Like any other wildlife, I'm just happy to see them and enjoy nature."
716295,Ralph Field,2012-07-20 02:52:00,1018,The elimination of the spring bear hunt was during Mike Harris' rein wasn't it?
716297,jedimaster,2012-07-20 03:07:00,3472,"I tend to know the odds of getting struck by lightning, and I am not afriad of lightning. I don't walk around with a metal pole on my head during storm, and I also get off the water during a thunderstorm. Its not the average bear to be worried about, but the last time I checked they don't wear special shirts that says what one is safe and what one is not. There was another guy that spent his life learning about bears, studying them and tempting fate with them... Of course all know where he ended up. In the belly of a bear, along with his wife as I recall. I too have seen many bear up close, in the bush and even on my deck in my backyard. I am not afraid of them but I do know that that having a bear inside a populated area, that is associating humans with food, is a bad bad situation."
716301,danc,2012-07-20 03:26:00,4677," They make it into inner Thunder Bay each and every summer. Because of the hype and fear of bears, they are dispatched by the cops. The MNR is always too slow to respond, so the cops just shoot them. We must have the best police force in the province because nobody has ever been injured by a bear before the cops shot it.  On the other hand, the cops fired a shot at a bear in town that went right through a family's kitchen table during supper hour. Luckily there was nobody at the table at the time. Anything to get rid of those mean, nasty, killer bears though."
716307,jedimaster,2012-07-20 03:51:00,3472,If the cops were hunters they would have ensured of the safe back stop before shooting.

716311,funfishing,2012-07-20 04:41:00,147," I'm not surprised the MNR turned it down, they can only afford the ""bear essentials"" right now."
716315,funfishing,2012-07-20 05:36:00,147," I might add, that's no ordinary pun there.  Firstly, it's obviously a play on the words bear/bare.  Also, ""Please bear with us"" can be interpreted as ""Please, let's keep the bear with us,""   or even ""Let's please the bear that is with us, [by not shooting it].""  A triple pun, that's gotta be some kind of a record."
716316,glen,2012-07-20 05:45:00,2641,Would you like a bear in your yard near your kids? The cops better get more bullets.    Timothy Tastewell says bears are safe.
716349,BillM,2012-07-20 12:04:00,17367," Agreed.  People that think black bears are going to run out of the woods and maul their children/dogs are extremely misinformed.  Most bears I see are headed the other way in a hurry, it's usually the only ass end I see, lol!  It's about on par with people swimming in the ocean worried they'll be attacked my sharks."
716364,Billy Bob,2012-07-20 12:37:00,5865, NICE.......I only had the pun 2X.....but I see can get a triple decker out of it....LOL...
716365,Live2fish85,2012-07-20 12:40:00,1633,"I can't believe so many people want to kill the bears because they are increasing in numbers. I personally love seeing them. As DanC said if you have some common sense you will be fine.  I have been 15' away from a bear while Portaging in Kilarney. It was a bit nerve racking as it was only a young one and the mother was probably close, we just gave it the space and when it noticed us it took off. We had our bear spray bottles with us and ready incase but as would happen 95% of the time we were fine.  You have a higher chance of getting mauled by some scum bag for you money in a major city then getting mauled by a bear. I guess some of you folks are worried about the wrong things."
716368,Billy Bob,2012-07-20 12:44:00,5865," In 2006 the wife and I did a out west camping trip......bought a large pop up camper....some call it a tent trailer.......  But anyways......on this trip we camp 4 days in Yellowstone Park.......since we did not have a complete hard shell camper we were restricted on where we were allowed to camp....anywhere where there was bear activity we were not allowed to set up our pop up camper.....AND even in the area we were allowed in, a Park Ranger would constantly walk the campground insuring you did not leave out your cooking stuff, including your coolers and grill.....EVERYTHING had to be put away in your truck when you were finished with your meal.  Yes, bears can be serious and the National Park Service realizes this and they take all the precautions they can. So should you."
716377,BillM,2012-07-20 12:57:00,17367,"Agreed 100% BB, a little precaution goes a long way.   Give them nothing to come back for (food, garbage) and they won't be an issue."
716379,lew,2012-07-20 13:00:00,12766," Agree with you 100% but it seems like some folks just like to slaughter every animal they encounter.  We've had plenty of encounters around here since I moved in a couple years back. They've been on my front lawn, the driveway another time and in the back yard on several occasions and everyone else on the road has had them too, specially in the early spring.  Their just hungry after a long winters nap and looking for an easy meal but nobodies ever had a serious encounter with them.  Just this morning I watched a show about black bears up in Anchorage Alaska and the darned things are everywhere and wandering around town like lost cats. They claim even up there where folks SHOULD  know better they still put the garbage out too early and the bears have a feast. They still don't kill the bears though unless absolutely necessary, they just dart them and haul their butts away although they admitted they normally find their way back."
716387,Live2fish85,2012-07-20 13:18:00,1633," I agree when they are a constant nuisance and come back then they need to be dealt with. Even saying that though it isn't usually the bears that are used to people that attack people. It is the one not used to people and think they are a meal, most times you hear of a camper being mauled it is because they either brought food into a tent or didn't change there clothes after dinner. I remember camping and two kids in a tent got attacked by a bear. People were freaking out and leaving the park. After that they found chocolate bars in the kids tent. The kids didn't die thankfully but there was no bear going after the kids, he was going.for the chocolate bars and the kids probably startled him.  I love seeing bears and any wildlife. Give them respect and they will you."
716389,Harrison,2012-07-20 13:23:00,2202,"I am not afraid of bears, I am however very nervous around bears that are not afraid."
716405,jedimaster,2012-07-20 14:07:00,3472,"The problem with bears that has been very very well documented over the years is this. Bears in the woods doing there thing are not a problem. 99 percent of tthe bear encounters are not a problem. There are however three situations where bears are a problem.  1) Rogue freak out not wired properly black bears that will stalk humans. 2) a mother and her cub with a human in between. 3) A bear that has associated human pressence with food.  Not all of these will relate into a bad encounter every time. However the chances of being in a a deadly or life threatening encounter in one of these three are greatly increased over the typical encounter of ""Hey look a bear walked through our camp sight/driveway/backyard/trailer park and I shouted at it and it ran away.""  People have a good amount of control over reducing these like putting there stuff away, however the only real answer is to reduce the bear population to the point where they bears have no need or desire to come out of where they typically live in search of food.  As the bear population increase there home range gets cramped and they spread and encroach on urban areas as far south as Oshawa and Oakville. I have even heard of them being in Rouge River valley.  No one is asking for a mass cull on bears like they were asian carp or round eyed gobies. Population control is something that is not able to be sustained with a fall bear hunt. I see this as being a two pronged issue. 1) remove the bears that are currently associating humans with food in and around urban areas. 2) bring back the spring bear hunt to encouage more hunters to harvest bears and help control the population to a sustainable level within the areas that they should naturally be.  Make no mistake about it, a bear should not be living in a town or city. A grown adult knows enough to stand up tall and make some noise to scare off a bear. A child will freak out cry and run.  I know all sorts of people that never had an incident with a bear. But I bet my last dollar anyone that has been mauled, attacked or chased by a bear couldn't give a rats ass how many times you or I have seen a bear without incident."
716414,Live2fish85,2012-07-20 14:23:00,1633," I don't agree. Why can't we teach our kids, change our habits toleave garbage all over.  People that live north and have bears all over teach there kids how to respect a bear and what to do.  They hardly worry about bears. They are aware and use common sense. I also believe that the attacks you hear about when theres a bear in a town is because some moron freaked out scaring the bear and making them react to what is there nature. Teach the people don't kill the bears."
716417,jedimaster,2012-07-20 14:30:00,3472," Even though I currently live in Toronto. Thats only been for the last few years. You can certainly teach your 5 year old child to not leave the garbage can out at night, not eat in a tent, and not leave out some bird seed. But do you honestly believe that ANY 5 year old child will react properly and be able to fend a bear off should the unthinkable happen? Think about it honestly befor eyou hug a tree and spout something out. Actually think about the situation. Close your eyes and picture yourself in it. If you had or have kids  and if/when they were or are 5 years old, how would you think they would react if they were outside in the backyard playing with there friends  and a bear walked in between them and the house looking for some food. How would they react? And how would you react If you were inside your house, and your kids was at the back of your yard and a 600 pound Black bear was inbetween you and him or her?  I highly doubt you would go run for your camera to take a picture of the pleasant and natural encounter."
716175,Flappn,2012-07-19 20:06:00,245,"So we have seen a bear in our trailer park up north over the last week on a few occasions. 2 nights ago at about 12 midnight sitting around having a few drinks we hear some noise about 20 feet behind us around the BBQ. Turn around, there standing is a black bear. So of course panic set's in, people started to scream which woke up a buddy inside the trailer sleeping. When he awoke to the noise, looked out the window and saw the bear standing beside the BBQ. He grabbed some fire crackers, light them and threw them out the door. Bang Bang Bang....bear is gone.  So the owner of the Park was informed, he new the bear has been hanging around and he called the Ministry. He told them he saw the bear on a few occasions and last night was a little to close for comfort for some of his occupants...can you come trap/remove the bear.  Guess what their answer was. We have no money to come trap the bear!! I guess someone needs to get mauled before money isn't an issue. I hope it's no myself or my family.  I love nature and everything in it, however I am not cool with a bear hanging around instead of passing through."
716186,Dara,2012-07-19 20:26:00,3052,So buy some firecrackers...way cheaper than trapping and the bears just come back after you let them loose anyway.
716187,Joeytier,2012-07-19 20:28:00,3990,So has the bear returned after the firecracker?  They're usually quite effective.
716188,misfish,2012-07-19 20:39:00,29133," I,m sorry,but this comment made me laugh.You are out where they belong.You are invading their space. Don,t blame the MNR.  All I can say is,BE PREPARED."
716190,NAW,2012-07-19 20:46:00,4022,How far north we talkin here?

716200,Ralph Field,2012-07-19 21:11:00,1018,"The owner of the camp ground can get a nucinise licence and shoot the bear if it continually causes trouble , but I like the fire cracker idea better."
716201,Billy Bob,2012-07-19 21:14:00,5865,"Well, I guess the MNR could of just said ""Please Bear With Us""...."
716204,misfish,2012-07-19 21:28:00,29133,LMAO Billy.
716212,Leecher,2012-07-19 21:57:00,7832,"I'd be really weary of a bear coming that close  those are the worst type and will continue to visit your site simply because he want's food.  Fire crackers will only deter him for a while but beware.  If the MNR can't do anything about it.... well there's only one solution... if your a hunter, have your riffle close by and don't hesitate to pull the trigger when your family and you are face with life threatening situation.  I'm not saying to go out and shoot any bear at first site but only if he's persistent in coming around your area (your BBQ)  only thing he wants is eat and he will if he has to eliminate you and your family to get to his food.  A few years ago, I was going to my hunting camp in a ZEC in Québec and when we got to the gate keeper to register, a bear was laying down in front of the camp... gate keeper had to eliminate him since he was trying to bust the back door down to get to the coolers of food  All this to say, you don't play around when an animal is trying to get inside your camp for food and it places yourself and family in danger.  My 2 cents TJunkie"
716213,Skud,2012-07-19 22:13:00,739,Bears taste great. Cook him ON your BBQ.
716214,krixxer,2012-07-19 22:15:00,274,nothing a quick trip to Epps can't fix
716216,Leecher,2012-07-19 22:16:00,7832, Good one Skud
716217,bigbuck,2012-07-19 22:21:00,2449,"Do what the local types do up north, shoot it and have a bbq if it keeps coming around. MNR and OPP don't want to deal with them any more."
716225,Billy Bob,2012-07-19 22:40:00,5865,REAL Solution......SPRING BEAR HUNT.
716239,John,2012-07-19 23:55:00,2956,I guess I find it amusing that it appears to be a surprise. Spring bear hunt won't solve your problem..
716240,Rich Nelson,2012-07-20 00:07:00,332, X2!!  Thats the main problem to begin with. Too many tree huggers!
716244,John,2012-07-20 00:15:00,2956,I'm just a simple person so you will need to explain to me how a Spring bear hunt will solve this particular problem. Note he didn't say that there were dozens of them attacking the residents.
716246,Fisherman,2012-07-20 00:31:00,7201,"Well here's a simple answer.  For many years there was a spring bear hunt, this kept the numbers in check and still left enough bears for the amount of forage food they could find in the ""northern"" wilderness.  As a result of the spring bear hunt cancellation, the numbers of bears have increased but the food source has not.  If you're a bear and hungry, you start traveling, unfortunately southwards.   Seeing as how you're from Burlington, a little further south, they have not gone that far..yet.  Wait until they learn how to use the bus and drop by your place...for a snack or two."
716249,ctered,2012-07-20 00:40:00,40,Actually there was one back in May around the Oakville/Burlington border that had to be shot because it was getting to close to people. It was there for a couple of days before it was shot.
716252,NAW,2012-07-20 00:50:00,4022, Going to bait this weekend.  Looking forward to my first bear hunt this fall.
716255,outllaw,2012-07-20 00:56:00,1232,it will get worse. drought no berries just wait. someone will get mauled or killed.

716275,Toad Hunter,2012-07-20 01:42:00,261,Its too bad there wasn't a way to light the bbq from a distance with fire crackers in side lol
