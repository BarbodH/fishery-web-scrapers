716869,Billy Bob,2012-07-22 13:06:00,5865,"I have a couple of leaky rivets on my boat that are impossible to get to unless I would completely remove the console floor and rod locker.....instead for years I just clean that area real good and apply silicone caulking to those rivets on the outside of the boat, works great."

716915,Ralph Field,2012-07-22 15:57:00,1018,"I used the green epoxy sticks from CT and they stopped the leaks, of course that is after I replaced a lot of rivets. Do not try to tighten the rivets yourself it only caused me more grief ,take it to a marine repair store."

I used that aluminum epoxy that comes in a tube. You roll the two parts in your hand,press firmly into leaking area of aluminum.Let cure. That was five years ago and still no sign of water.Mind you all repairs were applied to the exterior side of the canoe."
