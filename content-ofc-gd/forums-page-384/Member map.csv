716346,Roy,2012-07-20 11:56:00,13728,Not many people ever referred to it so it slid down a priority list. See what we can do.
716360,lew,2012-07-20 12:34:00,12766," Nothing to worry about Roy, I was just curious is all."
716393,Default User,2012-07-20 13:42:00,72,awww man...I want to know what it was all about LOL  what did/does it do?
716410,jedimaster,2012-07-20 14:15:00,3472,"When you enter your location into your profile, Roy gets a message and he sneaks into your house at night and implants a gps tracking chip into your spine. Your co-ordinates are then tracked and displayed on a google earth GIS layer for all to see. The map is also cross referenced with wind patterns, time of day, lake depth charts, barometric and lunar readings.  Now where did I put my tin foil hat?"
