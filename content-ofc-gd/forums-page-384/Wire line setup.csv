716257,bucktail,2012-07-20 00:57:00,1857,Looking for some help on how to set up a wire line rig for Lake O  This spring I bought a wire rod and big Convector reel as well as a 1000ft odf 19 strand Torpedo trolling Wire and a high Quality swivel wire tip top.  My questions are. What do i use for backing?  What type of knots do I use.  Any other pointers would be gratly appreciated.    Darren
716261,spincast,2012-07-20 01:07:00,3279,1000ft? you should be good with out any backing? I only run mine 250 - 350 back at the most knot to the swivel?  My link
716263,fishdawg,2012-07-20 01:13:00,912,what reel did you get?  no backing needed.... a 1000 ft spool perfectly fills a 30 size okuma or 600 tekota or a 47 dawai
716265,dave524,2012-07-20 01:21:00,4508,"What size Convector??? the 30 is a perfect fit for 1000 feet of wire, a 45 size will need some backing."
716272,Pikeslayer,2012-07-20 01:32:00,1443,Wind enough braid to cover the base of the spool to prevent slipping (metal on metal). Don't forget to run out your wire under load (dispey only on 3) at least 600 ft and retrieve without releasing the dispey clip. This helps to tighten your wire on the spol and prevent kinking. Always let your wire out gradually under load when deploying tackle to avoid tangles.  Here's you knot  http://www.lotsa.org/Wire%20Line%20Knot.htm
716288,SlowPoke,2012-07-20 02:33:00,2984,I use 100' braid tied with an albright knot to 1000' wire and a 15' fluoro leader tied with another albright knot. The leader offers a little stretch so I dont use a snubber and it also keeps your wire safely stored on the spool.

716597,Sinker,2012-07-20 21:45:00,8692,"Just remember to shorten your leaders on a flasher fly, from the dipsy, so from the dipsy to the hooks is a rod length.  A spoon leader will be longer than a flasher leader.  Makes netting easier when the line from dipsy is a rod length to the hooks.  S."
