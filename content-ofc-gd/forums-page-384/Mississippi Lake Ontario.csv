We live in Ottawa and usually fish the Rideau and Ottawa rivers. I am looking for a lake within about a 1 hour drive from Ottawa and there aren't too many. I have contimplated going to Mississippi Lake a few times in the past but have never gone. Anyone ever been to Mississippi Lake and if so how is the fishing, for bass, pike or walleye specifically? Also any place to take the young lad for a swim? Free or paid boat launch? Any info would be much appreciated!  Matt"
