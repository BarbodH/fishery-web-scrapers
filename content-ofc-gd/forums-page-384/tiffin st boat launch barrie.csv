716192,NAW,2012-07-19 20:49:00,4022,"Was there last week and did not pay.  I herd they put a machine in, but where not planning on charging people till next year.  Not 100% sure.  It's just a matter of time before you have to pay.  And yes, you pay to park, not to launch."
716194,davey buoy,2012-07-19 20:53:00,5505," That parking lot at the launch,they now charge to park your boat and trailer?.Weekends must be free and after 5pm?"
716196,misfish,2012-07-19 21:06:00,29133,"The lot there,is just for trucks/cars ,with trailers. It,s about time they charged. If you want to launch and not be charged,you can park at the lot across the street. Then again,if you want to use our launch,pay and support.  If you are an early bird,you launch in no time. But if your one to come back after 3pm,get ready to rumble. it,s a frigg,n nut house.  There are many that don,t know the rules of, FIFO. Drove me nuts. Being a resident,I use the Barrie Marina. My friends like that as well.   All said,this city needs to step up on the fees."
716207,kickingfrog,2012-07-19 21:40:00,8333,"I believe council was kicking around the idea of fees that would be charged to non-residents to launch. I think a ""study"" was planned.  Edit Barrie council is not looking at charging non-residents to lunch. lol"
716209,davey buoy,2012-07-19 21:43:00,5505," Non residents ,and people parking cars in the vehicle/ trailer areas for sure.!!"
