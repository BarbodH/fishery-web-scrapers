I am thinking of getting a spinning reel and rod to finish off this fishing season. Then in the fall will buy the rest.  I am mainly fish for Bass and Walleye, using variety of lures(tubes, grubs, senkos's, dropshot, jig's, spinners, and crank's).  How often does the manufacturers update their reels?  I was thinking of getting either the Shimano Stradic FJ or Sustain FG, and combining that with the St. Croix Avid.  How old is the Sustain FG, its older than the Stradic's right?  I am probably going for the Sustain.  As for the Rod, what about the St. Croix Legend Extreme as compared to the Avid?  I need to have a 2 peice rod, thus why I am choosing those 2.  Does the Shimano Crucial compare?  there is a 2 peice 7.2' Crucial.  Which one would pair better with the Sustain?  Then in the fall, I'll probably buy the Stradic Ci4 again for the lightweight.  What rod should I pair that with?  thanks"

The reals below stratic were just updated at i-cast."
