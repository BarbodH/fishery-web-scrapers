716771,aplumma,2012-07-21 21:53:00,6896,Went down to the Potomac river today with Earl. We ran across the river through a wet mess of rain and waves to get to a backbay area that we had fished before. First up we ran back into a weeded area that had potential for a few good bites. We started with a rubber mouse on one pole and a spinner on another. The spinner was the first to get blown up but it was a swing and a miss for Earl. We then worked down the weedbed and picked up a few bass nothing big but fun to catch. We continued and the mouse was the next lure to get mauled.    About 4 lbs.  We fished on with 2 more blow ups but no hooks where sunk. The weather got worse so we packed it in and headed back to the launch.  A good day was had by all and the Snakehead is being prepared for dinner tonight.  Art

716814,hammercarp,2012-07-22 01:58:00,964,Neat looking fish.
716818,NAW,2012-07-22 02:11:00,4022,How do the snakehead taste.  Are the comparable to other native fish for flavour?
716826,kickingfrog,2012-07-22 02:43:00,8333,  River Monsters mentioned what good eating they are.
716860,Dabluz,2012-07-22 12:01:00,701,"Real ugly fish are often good to eat.  But then, really nice looking fish like trout, walleye, salmon and pike are also good to eat."
716864,davey buoy,2012-07-22 12:21:00,5505,"Big city fishing mentioned good eating as well. Florida where the show was filmed,mentioned no release of Snakehead caught , back into the lake. seek,destroy,or eat only."
716906,Joey,2012-07-22 15:24:00,9122,"Cool Art, never tasted one but bet they are delish"
716914,kickingfrog,2012-07-22 15:56:00,8333,"While we're on the subject of invasives, anybody tried gobies? Maybe deep-fried in beer batter?"
716978,aplumma,2012-07-22 20:29:00,6896,"The Snakehead is an invasive species here so the rule is catch and kill do not return to the water. I found they are a very light colored firm fleshed fish that tastes very good. They are meat eaters and have the taste of Catfish for the most part. The fillet is very meaty and can be baked, fried or fixed in almost any manner of any fish that is not oily. Once you put them on someones plate and don't tell them it is snakehead they all decide that they will eat it in the future as long as they aren't told what it is before hand.lol.  Art"
716988,Garfisher,2012-07-22 21:45:00,229," I wouldn't eat them, they have a ton of contaminants in them because they eat the zebra mussels which filter a lot of that stuff. Very nice catch aplumma"
