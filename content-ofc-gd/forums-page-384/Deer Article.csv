My trophy whitetail is in this summers Ontario Monster Whitetail magazine sent out today. Cool thing about it is that I stilll havnt seen my mount but James at Advanced put it together early for a photo shoot and now graces the magazine with a full page photo. As always insanely great work by James at Advanced and a big surprise to see my trophy before I get it!    Darrn
