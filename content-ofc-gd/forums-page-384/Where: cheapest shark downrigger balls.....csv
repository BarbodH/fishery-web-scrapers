I guess I had a kink in my cable, as it snapped at the surface, and watched it sink to 147feet on my fish finder.  I am leaving Ottawa heading to Manitoulin this week. Heading down the 17 all the way through North bay, sudbury, espanola....you get the idea. Any place on the way that has a decent price on these? I am using my 8lb backup sphere right now...and would like to replace my lost 10lb shark."
