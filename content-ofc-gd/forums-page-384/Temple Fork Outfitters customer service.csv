Some of you may remember a little while ago I was asking about finding a replacement section to my fly rod. Well I emailed them, found that it could be done, price etc... It completely slipped my mind until last Sunday I remembered that I still didn't have a rod! So monday I called TFO and asked them to ship a new piece right away, then I just had to hope, well this morning as soon as I woke up the FedEx truck pulls up and brings the new piece to the door! just wanted to share the good service."
