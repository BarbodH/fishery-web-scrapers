716838,nroadrunner,2012-07-22 03:36:00,113,  Well my young lad spotted my minnow trap in the shed a couple weeks ago and wanted to try it.  So we set it last night for fishing today.  I have not used live bait (other than the odd worm) inover 10 years got tired of having my traps stolen.  The old stomping grounds didn't dissapoint trap had about 8 dozen minnows in it this morning mostly golden shiners and dace.  We headed to the dam at 8am Tyler had 2 fish before I had a hook on my line.  It continued from there for 30 min we had a fish every second cast.  Then Tyler decides to move down a bit to fish.  The result was a fish every cast no monsters but he did manage 3 or 4 cookie cutters in the 1lb range.  FIshed from 8 until 11 caught about 40 fish.  We headed down tonight to use the rest of the minnows and to see if I could redeem myself LOL Fishing was not as great but steady.  Biggest tonight was around 2 2 1/2 lbs                  When my wife said hold it sideways so  can get a shot of the gut I thought she meant on the fish LOL   Ian
