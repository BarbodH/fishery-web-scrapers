716638,Billy Bob,2012-07-21 00:19:00,5865,"In 2006 the wife and I did a out west camping trip......bought a large pop up camper....some call it a tent trailer.......  But anyways......on this trip we camp 4 days in Yellowstone Park.......since we did not have a complete hard shell camper we were restricted on where we were allowed to camp....anywhere where there was bear activity we were not allowed to set up our pop up camper.....AND even in the area we were allowed in, a Park Ranger would constantly walk the campground insuring you did not leave out your cooking stuff, including your coolers and grill.....EVERYTHING had to be put away in your truck when you were finished with your meal.  Yes, bears can be serious and the National Park Service realizes this and they take all the precautions they can. So should you.  Those were grizzlies. We're talking about black bears here. SORRY.........but Yellowstone is noted for BOTH bears INCLUDING BLACK BEARS"
