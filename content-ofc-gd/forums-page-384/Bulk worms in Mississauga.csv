715908,gordy28,2012-07-19 00:42:00,638,The thread for Hamilton area got me going on this but I didn't want to hijack (if etiquette of the board says I should have posted there my apologies) We are going on a trip in September where bait is not included-most reading has led me to believe worms on harnesses is the primary walleye tactic.  Feedback seems to be that bait is expensive via the lodge I bought a large worm box w food and artificial bedding to take with us to use out in the boat (will hold up to 12 dozen)  Love to get a flat of worms in the Sauga area instead of buying 12 dozen so from Lebarons at $2.50 a pop Does anyone have any recos? Also interested in any tips for prepping and care using artificial bedding (if instructions on package are the way to go-cool I can follow direction) Thanks in advance Gordy

Use rainwater or distilled water to mix.Start with less than they say, mx, and add a bit as necessary.Bring the worms to a boil......No....just kidding. Put worms in fridge in original container until they are the same temp as the bed box.Then transfer over.You can buy food too in powdered form.easy to use."
