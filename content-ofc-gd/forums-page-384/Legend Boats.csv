716787,woodenboater,2012-07-21 23:30:00,2277,"Just asking but I'm curious what you consider to be bull fees ? I see they have a boat version of vehicle pdi for $500 and a delivery charge for $700 (does this apply if you buy off the showroom floor ?) But yeah, another $1200 is another hit on the pocketbook.  I'd still look at Legends along with Lunds, Smokercraft and a few others. But as others have suggested, wait a year or so, put aside a K a month if you can and you're more than halfway to a new boat !  I'd also look hard at what's listed here tbh."

After a lot of searching we found this Princecraft Resorter DLX with a side console for 4900 and we were able to talk the seller down to 4500. It's all the boat we need and it works nicely as we tried it out on the Rideau River this evening! Very happy that we are saving 25000 and still got a boat that works for us!

716846,pikehunter,2012-07-22 10:00:00,1659,"Nice looking boat. Isn't it amazing how good a galvanized trailer looks even after12 years? You should be able to enjoy many happy hours in that boat and you didn't have to have the wealth of Fort Knox in your back pocket to buy it. My last boat had a galvanized trailer, I decided that it was a must when I bought it after seeing other brand new painted ones rusting away sitting on the dealer's lot.  Don't forget to check your wheel bearings, tires and bottom end oil in the motor.  Cogratulations"
716870,GbayGiant,2012-07-22 13:08:00,1780, If I was you I would contact a Lawyer and talk about the fact that Legend left you out on a lake with a boat that could have killed you. I am sure you found out about the leak on the water when your bilge pump kept running. If by chance you had lost power you would have sunk and could have died. That alone right there should be enough to hold this problem you have over their head. They would be responsible for anything that happens to you in their leaks boat due to the fact it was bad workmanship.  Good luck with your leaky boat. Legend boats are the worst ever made in my opinion. The way they handled your situation is sad and shows their character very well.
715926,DundasSteelheader,2012-07-19 01:34:00,166,I could be wrong but when I glanced through the classifieds this jumped out as a pretty good deal and seems to fit your requirements? http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=64039

The total monthly payment is key for me. As for more boat for the price on a brand new boat, any suggestions? Forgot to mention that the max towing capacity of my vehicle is about 1200 pounds. This 15 Angler is pretty much max (i think)."

715941,krixxer,2012-07-19 02:10:00,274,Donâ€™t do it.   If you take the boat out 30 times a year for the next 5; a total of 150 water days.  27k\150 =$180/trip + + + + + you are at $250  save up some cash...  for 7500 you are in the market for some real nice boats. 7500\150 =$50+++ you can have a nice on the water for $150 day   conclusion... buy used and you can run for free for around 4 years?  
715974,lew,2012-07-19 10:42:00,12766," I just couldn't imagine being locked into payments for 15 years on such a small boat like that and paying double the price in interest.  Just my thoughts, but why not just hold off for a couple years and save your money until you can pay cash for it and save a small fortune on interest.  I couldn't even enjoy fishing from a boat knowing it would take 15 years just to pay for it, but that's just me."

715977,pikehunter,2012-07-19 11:12:00,1659,"You must rally really want a new boat a hell of alot to go in debt $150 a month, especially for that long. I know not everyone can pay cash for what they ""think"" they need in life but I believe I'd rather buy a cheaper new boat or a similiar used one. Something I could afford.  My father once told me this, ""If you can't pay cash for it then that means you can't afford it."" I try to live by those words as best as I can. Just my opinion, don't be phased by all the shine of a showroom beauty. It will soon fade with the first scratch or the first time you run the motor into the shop and look at the $500 bill sitting on the counter, the $150 payment bill in one hand and your now empty wallet in the other.

I purchased my Legend Pro Sport three years ago used, lucked out and found a virtually brand new 2009 model for a great deal. If you can last the rest of this year without a boat, wait until fall, THAT is when the best deals are to be found!"
715993,landry,2012-07-19 12:27:00,1005,"I strongly encourage u to buy a 16' boat with a wider beam. It will make your shorter boat seem much bigger. I would look for a beam of 80 or more inches. And I think u r spending away too much with poor financing on that boat. Don't forget that you need to account for repairs and upkeep after the 4th year or so and paying monthly fees plus upkeep will be really annoying for 15 yrs. I bought a 2007 crest liner fish hawk with 16 verified hours on the engine and two years left on the motor warranty for 10,250$ plus hst. Bought in the states. It is usually your best bet. Buy in the fall. If you are patient and you narrow in on a particular model or models then you will find a steaI. I would walk in the other direction from that deal!!!!!! Landry"

716023,Woodsman,2012-07-19 13:07:00,1286,"You may be over your capacity with the 15' Angler already. Add boat weight, motor weight, trailer weight, fuel weight & gear weight to start with. Also deduct from your 1200 lbs the extra weight of your passengers & other things loaded in your vehicle."
716024,doubleheader,2012-07-19 13:14:00,497," I have to agree with these guys. It's obvious how bad you want to hit the water but you'd be much better off in the size boat you're looking for to chill out this year, put the $150/mo away each month, and buy a used boat early next year. There is no question if it were me in this size boat I'd buy used. Additionally I'd buy from an individual vs a dealer. I've been doing his boat thing for over 40 years and I'm telling you the key to buying a boat right is patience. Between now and next summer you'll find a boat that will make you very happy at 1/4 the cost, and you'll feel a heck of a lot better for making a good purchase. In the meantime do your research. For instance, if I were buying a used aluminum hull, I would prefer a riveted hull vs. welded. Just my opinion after having had both, but I can repair a few leaky rivets no problem. I's probably also prefer a double thick hull, Lund, Alumacraft, and I think Princecraft have this. Also, make sure you look over the transom, find out how it's been stored, inside or out, because if older and it's been stored outside the transom core is likely in need of replacement. Make sure you test drive anything before making offer and take along someone that knows outboard motors. if you get to the point of making an offer, make it contingent on an outboard motor mechanic's inspection. may cost you $100 bucks but it may save you a lot more. One last thought, what about a Geisler ceder strip boat?"
716097,lookinforwalleye,2012-07-19 16:45:00,4399,Seems like a lot of money for that rig! Could have had my Stratos for a lot less than that!

716113,JoshS,2012-07-19 17:28:00,729,"I think you need a tow vehicle first if your vehicle is rated for 1200lbs. And for the money you are going to spend on that legend, I'd cut that 15k budget down to 10, shop around diligently and buy used. You'll get a lot more for less. I also agree that it's crazy to finance like that.  As an example, I spent 6k on an '04 1600sc sylvan expedition with a 75hp merc. Drove to Michigan to get it. I spent four months shopping around. It's not top of the line but serves me well, was in decent condition and inexpensive for what I got IMO.. my first rig. I was able to save money from my budgeted amount and eventually get a truck to tow. Now I want to upgrade and will sell this boat next year for what I paid hopefully and look for another used package in the states.  Might want to consider your method of towing first if your planning on towing with a car and seriously consider looking for a good used package."

716366,Matt Janes,2012-07-20 12:40:00,49,"Thanks again everyone. I think all of you saved me 18000 on a boat and 9000 in interest. We decided not to go with the Legend dealer. The price was just too expensive when you factored in the motor upgrade and all the other Bull fees that they tack on a new boat. Also, I'm not sure if it is common but we couldn't even test out the boat in the water before committing to a purchase, which I thought was similar to buying a car without taking it for a test drive. Maybe this is the norm when buying a new boat? What looked like 10000 in the flyer turned out to be 18000 plus interest by the time the bill of sale was complete. Long story short, it was just too much. We only got our 14' aluminum with 15HP mercury 2 stroke this year (we only paid 1200 including the trailer) so we will enjoy it a little more before we go looking for a new (or used) boat. I liked what a lot of people said about checking in the states, it seems like there are some wicked deals to be had over there, so that is a possibility. We won't be buying before next spring. Once again thanks for the insight and info and my wallet thanks you the most!  Matt"
716378,scugpg,2012-07-20 13:00:00,1373, Good advice here. Way too much in interest costs. I would be concerned about towing ability as well given the 1200lb capacity.
716774,danc,2012-07-21 22:24:00,4677,Agree. There's tons of great advice in this thread.
715191,Dan668,2012-07-17 02:37:00,1120,"also 2 stroke all the way, thats just my opinion, both are solid motors nowadays"

715314,Meegs,2012-07-17 14:36:00,249,"Have not been impressed with legend.  Our boat is 4 years old and has two bad leaks in it.  The aluminum has started to tear and the dealership has completely fluffed us off saying that its not covered under warranty. Weve never run the boat ashore or ever hit a rock, say its due to loading on the trailer.   Not impressed"
715316,Millhouse2020,2012-07-17 14:37:00,152,"I bought my first rig, used, last year.  I would have to echo most of the comments posted here, bigger is definately better for motors for a numbers of reasons, safety, power, even fuel efficiency since you dont have to run a bigger motor flat out to cruise at a decent speed.  Legend is a mfg that packages boats with smaller underpowered motors to put their product at a more favourable price point.  I noticed that when I was shopping.  When you step up the power to its max range, package prices are comparable to other brands.  My buddy boughgt a new legend 24 foot pontoon boat last year and that boat came packaged with a 15hp motor if you can believe that.  With the top up and the wind blowing, I think you barely tread water with a 15hp in such a large boat.  Even the salesman said you can't use the 15hp motor when he was putting the package together.  Why sell it like that is beyond me????  If you do buy used, be sure to remember that you will have to pay taxes on the purchase.  The seller I purchased from gave me 3 seperate invoices for the boat, motor and trailer.  I was charged HST on the value of the trailer when I changed the registration to myself. Do your homework if you buy used and make sure you get a unit that has not been abused.  Paying for a review of the rig by a professional is not a bad idea or perhaps a diagnostic test on the motor by a certified mechanic to make sure there are no issues.  I had a fuel injector go on my motor a couple months after I got my rig, fortunately it was covered under the warranty but the process of getting it covered was too onerus to write about here.  I will only say remember to get any warranty coverage transferred to you as soon as possible after purchase.   Hope this helps.  I'm excited for you, new toys are always fun!"
715436,Matt Janes,2012-07-17 19:12:00,49,"Thanks Guys,  After speaking to the sales guy at the dealer, I am unsure of what to do. He really seems to be pushing on the 4 stroke (probably for good reasons but still) saying that it's really hard to get 2 strokes, hard to resell and blah, blah. Anyway, I am going in tomorrow to meet with this guy and see what he can offer. In the meantime I have been researching and I found a Tracker boat that retails for almost the same price as the Legend 16' Xcite. This boat is the Tracker Super Guide V-16 SC. Not sure what to do at this point. The Legend seemed like a great deal but at $11000 plus about $3000 to upgrade to at least a 40HP 4 stroke is going to put me easily over $15000. We will see what happens tomorrow.  Again thanks for the input/info  Matt"

Secondly, there may or may not be a reason why I see so few Trackers on the waterways compared to most others. Are they getting a bad rap based on past QC issues or are people just too gun shy and would rather stick with a known commodity when dropping big $$ ?  If I can swing a new boat after my mortgage is burned, a Tracker is way down on my list for the above reasons. There are too many other fine choices available imo."

715506,Roy,2012-07-17 21:31:00,13728,"I just scanned through this thread for the first time. So far, I know that you have a budget of 15K or less if possible. That tells a marine dealership that you have 15K to give them if they can convince you that what they're offering you for your money is a good deal. Nowhere have I seen what you need in a boat. It's kind of important to know. Do you want to fish bigger water than what you have in the past with the 14'? Want a side console? Tiller? Do you mostly fish alone or with friends? Will you have kids in the boat? Do you mostly cast or troll? Do you need a bowmount electric? All of the answers to those questions and more will help us help you. The dealer who asks you none of those questions and just needs to know your budget, should be taken off your list. Budget is important but it's only one of the questions.

I finally put my foot down and said "" listen: I'm a mechanic, I can't reprogram an ECM in the bush, but I can fix a carburator""..  He finally agreed and raved from then on about the 2 stroke..

With 40HP 4 stroke and fees and a couple add ons it comes to basically 18000, including taxes. The guy was offering 6.5% interest over 15 years making the monthly payments very attractive at 150 a month. I realize over 15 years it's probably 15000 in interest but it really is a nice boat, especially in person. Now I have a difficult decision to make. Any thoughts?

On to the topic.  I am looking to buy a new boat. Right now I'm fishing out of an old 14 foot Starcraft Aluminum with a 15HP Merc motor (90's model). It does the job well and I've added all the things I could to make it comfortable but I need (want) something a bit nicer.  I am looking at the Legend 15 Angler. List price of 9,999. From doing a little research I hear that these boats are underpowered (only listed with a 20HP motor) and it takes a bit more cash to get a better motor. Also some of the finishes and carpeting I hear are cheaper fabrics.  I am looking for anyone information on this boat or any people's input who have experience with Legend boats (first or second hand info would be great!).  Obviously price is a major factor and I have looked at some similar Princecraft models that are at least 5000 more.  Thanks in advance!"
715041,Squid,2012-07-16 20:23:00,1656,This is what I just posted about in another thread. Ask for a price on the boat with the identical motor that princecraft offers for the smae sized boat. You will see that they are comparible in price.
715043,misfish,2012-07-16 20:26:00,29133,Contact Henry here on the board. Real nice guy.
715048,Live2fish85,2012-07-16 20:41:00,1633,Have you thought of buying used? There are some great deals for $10 000. An you can get something a bit bigger with a bigger motor.
715049,darsky,2012-07-16 20:41:00,586,Or do what I did and look  around for an older model within a few years that suits your needs. I found mine on KIJIJJI and traveled from Montreal to Guelph and back. I felt it was worth it.
715052,kickingfrog,2012-07-16 20:47:00,8333,"What ever boat you get, generally you do want a motor that is near the top end of the boat rating. If you only use the boat in a smaller, sheltered area and don't travel far then you could get a way with less, but you may always kick yourself for not getting more hp to start. Some will also suggest that if/when you go to sell your package that if the motor is not maxed out it will be harder to sell.  Look, look and look. Lots of options out there. What might be one person's dream boat is not someone else's."
715059,manjo39,2012-07-16 21:02:00,354," I have a 2012 Legend XCaliber and am happy with it.  The two things I recommend.  1st you already mentioned upgrading the motor.  Its a must.  Secondly, get the most trolling motor the boat can handle (battery compartment size) and that you can afford.  For me the trolling motor is as important as the main motor."
715063,Roy,2012-07-16 21:13:00,13728,Legend isn't the only company selling under powered boats. My neighbour bought a 16' SC Lund packaged with a 25hp last year. That is just sick.
715064,misfish,2012-07-16 21:18:00,29133,"  The lake he fish,s,must have slow roaming bass brudder."
715066,Roy,2012-07-16 21:22:00,13728,"It's ok to buy a 16' side console boat and CHOOSE to have a 25HP on it. You're the buyer, you make the choice. But to have it packaged that way as though it was a good, safe option, is nuts."
715096,tb4me,2012-07-16 22:42:00,3295,Cant go wrong with Legend..Just upgrade the motor. My friend has had one for many years..no leaks and very comfy..Good boats for the price IMO..Best part is they are from Canada..I dont think the boats themselves are but they are assembled and create employment right here in Ontario!
715105,sneak_e_pete,2012-07-16 23:23:00,540,"I just bought a new boat (Smokercraft).  I learned a few things as this was my first big boat purchase. 1. Go as big as you can with the main motor.  You want a motor that will move the boat nicely without running wide open.  Ya its more money, but worth it. 2. As mentioned, spend the money on a good trolling motor.  I laboured over buying a terrova with ipilot, but to me now that I have used it, is as important as anything. 3.  Spend some serious time sitting in the boat before you buy.  Bring your gear and see how it fits.  I love my boat to death, but my rods dont fit in the storage (eyes are too big to slide in.... never thought of that).  Good luck.... excited for you."
715108,UglyBug,2012-07-16 23:34:00,148,I've always been partial to Princecraft boats had two and both were excellent. Lots of options out there don't rush research ask for some on water tests and then choose. But as someone said try to get the max rated on the boat if possible you won't regret it. Good hunting and let us know what you get.
715111,Fisherpete,2012-07-16 23:39:00,1814,"Hi,  I bought a Legend Prosport 16' two years ago, and am very happy with it. The boat & trailer were quite affordable, and I already had a 30hp Honda tiller to put on it. It moves nicely... 27-28mph when I am alone. It does not have a ton of bells and whistles, and is not a big water boat, but for the Kawarthas it does everything I need. Like others have mentioned, if you are going to buy a package, upgrade the motor to at least 75-80% of the max HP rating. A friend of mine bought a Legend similar to the one you are now looking at with a 30hp on it (rated for up to 60) and the boat performed very poorly. I also recommend Henry (Legend dealership near Barrie) - he helped me with my purchase and was great to deal with.     Pete"
715112,DRIFTER_016,2012-07-16 23:44:00,10439,Had my Legend for 21 years now and love it. I also opted to upgrade the motor and have not been disappointed. In fact I know that I will own it until I croak!!   
715127,fish_fishburn,2012-07-17 00:04:00,1311,Why anybody would buy new is beyond me. Buy used let the guy buying new pay the big bucks and you buy it a few years later for huge savings. Then take the savings and pimp it out if you really want too.
715143,kickingfrog,2012-07-17 00:44:00,8333,  All valid. The X-factor is what did the previous owner do (or didn't do) to the motor?
715153,GYPSY400,2012-07-17 01:23:00,191,"  I have this same exact boat with a 30 merc 2 stroke on it..  Purchased june 2011 as new.. So far I'm very happy with it.. But I agree with the masses and upgrading the motor is a must ( a 9.9 on a 16 ft is a joke!).. Also watch the price of the options - $250 per seat and $799 for a 45lb motor guide is crazy.. I opted to buy seats at a local sudbury dealer for $70ea. And a 55lb minn Kota bow mount for $599.. A little more work to install but I'm happy with what I have.   I did shop around but what I found was either the price was too high for what I wanted ( the legend layout is Exactly how I wanted the lay out - no benches) or they didn't offer what I wanted ( ie: no front casting deck)  So all in all, shop around and price out what YOU want, it's your money.. But don't rule out Legend just because they ""apparently"" aren't as good as a Lund or princecraft. I"
715154,Terry,2012-07-17 01:24:00,14456, exactly
715157,GYPSY400,2012-07-17 01:27:00,191," X3.. My reason to purchase new was because I got sick of wasting time fixing old junk motors ( factor in time Not spent with family)before actually getting out to fish.. and tippy, leaking boats... I'm not looking back in regret because it's going to last me into my 50's"
715161,sneak_e_pete,2012-07-17 01:38:00,540,"I think buying new is great.  Sure I could have saved a few bucks buying used, but with new I know how it was treated.  Boats are a money pit, bit if you get what you want up front, it will last you forever.  I have no regrets."
715164,Matt Janes,2012-07-17 01:45:00,49,"Thanks so much everyone for the replies! The wealth of information on this forum is incredible. Obviously I haven't decided on a boat yet but when looking at the motor upgrades on the legend website I noticed that the price for a 50HP 4 stroke is $4500 and for the 50HP 2 stroke it's only 1800. Any real downfall to going with the 2 stroke instead of the 4 stroke? Obviously it's a major price difference but I have limited knowledge with this.  Thanks Again,  Matt"
715174,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-07-17 02:11:00,1107, 2's are a bit louder on idle and smell more they are peppier I love my 90 it pushes my 1825 lund at 40mph I don't think a 4stroke would hit that on my hull .Definately go max HP I still kick myself but I don't think a 125 would do to much more than the 90hp
715187,Fisherpete,2012-07-17 02:30:00,1814,"After running a 4 stroke now for a few years, I would never go back to a 2... they are quiet, no oil to mix with the gas, great on fuel efficiency, and virtually no smell/fumes. However I know some of the bigger, newer 2 strokes are much improved, and run much cleaner than 2 strokes of yesterday. As for the new vs. used debate, I bought a used boat a few years ago - with my current Honda - the boat was a lemon, and caused me a lot of headaches, but the motor has been awesome. Always a bit of a gamble buying anything used... try and buy from someone you know takes good care of their gear if possible.  Peter"
715190,Dan668,2012-07-17 02:36:00,1120,"I paid a tad more for a brand new Lund compared to used ones sold in Ontario, so no brainer to go new. Couldnt convince my parents to let me purchase it from the States, they didnt trust that option."
