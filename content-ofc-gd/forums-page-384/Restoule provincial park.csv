Most of the walleye I saw were VERY close to the slot, so measure carefully.  They bite almost exclusively at dusk/after dark in the lake for some reason, but I managed a nice shore lunch on an overcast afternoon.  Also a good chance at some brute musky.  My dog chased a good sized one through the shallows at the boat launch/dog beach."
