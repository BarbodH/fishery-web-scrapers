716141,anders,2012-07-19 18:42:00,1168,"I need a couple new downrigger balls and am looking at the Shark and Ridgeback. Has anyone used them, or are running them. Either good or bad comments are appreciated.  Thanks"
716222,silveradosheriff,2012-07-19 22:32:00,1025,"I have run the 16lb Torpedos, 15lb Sharks and 13lb Pancakes. They all do a good job - just comes down to value in my mind. I don't think the Sharks are worth the premium. I am pleased with the Torpedos and if you can get them at a good price, would be my choice. I have not tried the Rattlers.  RK"
716228,NANUK,2012-07-19 23:04:00,797,"I have used the regular round type, fish shape , 10, 15 lb sharks and a 13 lb torpedo weights and like torpedo & sharks, I prefer sharks over torpedo."
716238,Pikeslayer,2012-07-19 23:51:00,1443, I would agree with RK. I run both Shark & Torpedo and can't say if Shark is worth the premium. Know and fished with a lot of others on LO and never seen a Ridgeback on a boat  Slayer.
716268,fishdawg,2012-07-20 01:24:00,912,i run Atommik torpedo 13s     love em!
716340,BillM,2012-07-20 11:41:00,17367,12lb sharks here.  Worth every penny.
716347,Spiel,2012-07-20 12:01:00,9065," Well if it came down to a choice between those two I'd go for the sharks. I have sharks so I'm likely biased, but they're the best rigger weights I've used thus far."
716362,Fish Farmer,2012-07-20 12:35:00,2234,"I'm still using the old style round 8LB. Little scared spending the money on the others case I lose one, maybe I'm cheap.   Plus I have the older Big Jon elect. and worry about burning out the motors using those heavy balls. I'm sure those new style track better."
716370,anders,2012-07-20 12:47:00,1168,"when you use the sharks, is the line release just above the ball or at the fin of the ball?"
716376,BillM,2012-07-20 12:55:00,17367," There's no clip on the Shark itself, except for where it attaches to the rigger line...that's where I attach my release."
716385,anders,2012-07-20 13:14:00,1168, And you have no problem with tangles or the shark not tracking properly?
716386,BillM,2012-07-20 13:15:00,17367, None.
716403,Pikeslayer,2012-07-20 14:00:00,1443,   You'll definitely want/need one of these release clips with the Sharks:  http://www.coldwatertackle.com/blacks-downrigger-release-clip  These will not interfere with the fin (vs. walker & scotty release clips)  Slayer
716507,NANUK,2012-07-20 18:08:00,797,"I have been using Scotty releases with my sharks with no issues, I attach the release right above the shark."
