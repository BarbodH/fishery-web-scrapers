716671,Grimace,2012-07-21 01:54:00,2020," I use to wash my black truck every Friday night and by Monday morning at 7:05 AM it would be filthy again from the job site.  When I was working Saturdays, which would be about half the year, I wouldn't even bother.  But man, nothing looked better than when she was all shined up."
716672,SlowPoke,2012-07-21 01:55:00,2984, You can say what you want about Chrysler but at least they didn't build this... 
716674,Tybo,2012-07-21 02:01:00,1373,No that was designed for 16 year old girls.  :lol:
716680,Cudz,2012-07-21 02:23:00,2652,"Nice trucks guys.  White is my favourite colour for cars, black is the best colour when it is clean and that brown colour you got on your sport is sweet.  Tybo, one word......  Aztek enough said about that lol"
716685,i2cool2fool,2012-07-21 02:33:00,349,Nice truck. I have a 2009 Silver Laramie. I moved from GM truck and have no regrets.
716687,SlowPoke,2012-07-21 02:48:00,2984, I didn't even wanna go there. That's fighting dirty!
716688,Tybo,2012-07-21 02:53:00,1373,Still more of a truck then Ram.
716689,SlowPoke,2012-07-21 03:01:00,2984,"Roll down a window, the diesel fumes have gotten to you again."
716706,bassdreamer,2012-07-21 11:11:00,128,  Nice truck Grimace !
716707,lew,2012-07-21 11:24:00,12766,I had a fella at the house here recently with a brand new Ram with all the bells & whistles. He said he'd always owned F-150's before but wanted to try something different and said the Ram rode much nicer than the Ford.  I still like my Ford though
716709,Grimace,2012-07-21 11:40:00,2020," There is plenty to like.  I think all three of the big North American manufacturers are making excellent trucks right now.  Toyota trucks are not to be left out either, they are excellent.  Hell, I even heard of some wierdo naming his dog after his Tundra.    :rofl2:  It is similar to outboards.  Everyone brags about their brand of outboard and how they have never had any problems and they can do this because all manufacturers in the outboard business are making very good products."
716713,lew,2012-07-21 11:56:00,12766,"I agree Grimace, lotsa good products on the market these days. Pretty well just boils down to personal preference and customer service."
716718,Tybo,2012-07-21 12:33:00,1373, It has more too do with the quality of fuels and lubricants.Just in the last ten years there has been huge leaps and bounds in quality and advancements in thees fields.
716720,Grimace,2012-07-21 12:47:00,2020,Great point.
716731,Skipper D,2012-07-21 13:44:00,1970,"Welcome to the Ram family Bassdreamer , hope it go's as well for you as its gone for me , I got my first one in 94 then one in 98 , the third in 2001 , another in 2005 and now our 2012 Diesel .

716601,bassdreamer,2012-07-20 22:13:00,128,      Here's my new 2012 Ram ! Me and the boss(wife) will be heading to quinte next weekend for our week long fishing trip !
716603,BucktownAngler,2012-07-20 22:20:00,582,nice truck!  is that some kind of special edition? doesnt look like a regular Ram
716604,Ralph Field,2012-07-20 22:22:00,1018,Nice to see someone that still gets excited when they make a big purchase.
716605,davey buoy,2012-07-20 22:25:00,5505,"Nice truck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,You must of customized it a bit?"
716607,bushart,2012-07-20 22:32:00,2628,Nice  Billy Bob may be a little envious though
716608,hotsky,2012-07-20 22:37:00,400,"I like the look of Rams over any other truck, new models just look sexy! Congrats!"
716609,lew,2012-07-20 22:40:00,12766,"Yeah, I like that, nice colour too !!"
716610,esoxansteel,2012-07-20 22:40:00,1307,"Now thats a real man's truck, MOPAR all the way"
716611,ecmilley,2012-07-20 22:43:00,2163,nice colour congrats on your new toy hauler
716614,misfish,2012-07-20 22:56:00,29133,"The color is awesome. But my eyes are burning,,,,,,,,,,,,, May want to blurr out the plate though."
716628,SlowPoke,2012-07-21 00:03:00,2984,That's a great looking truck bass dreamer. I think the new Ram is hands down the best looking out there and I just hope its as reliable as the new F150's because I bought a 1500 Sport too. I opted for black because my new boat is black.   They roll out of the dealership like that. The sport hood really gives it character in my opinion.
716629,bassdreamer,2012-07-21 00:03:00,128,Everything is standard from dodge and the colour is Tequila Sunrise pearl !
716630,bassdreamer,2012-07-21 00:06:00,128,   Congrats on your sport to SlowPoke !
716632,SlowPoke,2012-07-21 00:12:00,2984,"Thanks. 5200 kms on it and all but 600 has been towing the boat. That 600km trip got me 12.8L/100km but pulling the boat is 22L/100km. The towing fuel economy is my only complaint. On the bright side, I always get a few compliments while I'm filling up LOL!!!!"
716642,sneak_e_pete,2012-07-21 00:29:00,540,Sweet truck man!
716653,Grimace,2012-07-21 01:08:00,2020,Beautiful truck!   I love that colour for the sports.   I just picked my 2012 RAM 3 weeks ago.  I went with the Laramie in the White-Chrome combo.  I think it looks very classy.   My truck looks identical to the one in this picture.  I have historically been a Ford guy but generally I do not limit myself to being on any 'team'.  Right now I like the Dodges the best.  This is the first time in my history that this has happened.  My Dad has a GMC and I really like it as well.  I love my new truck and yours is really sharp.  Here is a picture of a truck that is identical to mine.  Cheers man.  
716655,Mike the Pike,2012-07-21 01:14:00,3421,Nice ride the best looking truck is now the Dodge.  I am thinking about purchasing a Dodge Durango my next purchase
716658,SlowPoke,2012-07-21 01:20:00,2984," I'm not fond of the white sport but the Laramie and even the Big Horn with the chrome looks great. On my way back from the Quebec border today we had the same white Laramie pass us three times and I commented ""I don't like white but it looks great on the Ram!"" I think on any other truck, it looks like a work truck but Dodge really pulled it off with the chrome accents.  Since you posted a picture... this is mine. I should get around to getting a shot of it with the boat!  "
716661,Leecher,2012-07-21 01:29:00,7832,"Nice ride bassdreamer    Love the color   Congrats   Brian, if that's your truck... where's the front plate?? and check your pm... you got mail"
716663,Grimace,2012-07-21 01:41:00,2020,"  Beauty truck!!!!  I agree with everything you said here.  Nothing on Earth looks better than a black truck all shined up but have fun keeping her clean.  My last truck was black and boy did it look amazing after I washed it but then the heartbreak would set in with every speck of dust.  lol.  Cheers guys, and beautiful trucks!"
716665,SlowPoke,2012-07-21 01:42:00,2984," I'll ask you the same thing... where's your front plate? Actually, I'm glad Quebecer's don't have front plates because when I see them coming in the mirror I know prepare for the worst! That picture was when I went to look at it on the lot... I still haven't taken a decent picture of it!"
716666,Tybo,2012-07-21 01:45:00,1373,Why does every thing in Chrysler`s stable look like it was designed by a 16 year old girl.  :rofl2:
716667,Leecher,2012-07-21 01:45:00,7832, Had a feeling you'd say that    Were not all that bad    crazy maybe but not bad
716668,Tybo,2012-07-21 01:46:00,1373,....
716669,SlowPoke,2012-07-21 01:49:00,2984," Thanks. It's a mess right now... lol It sits all week in a dusty gravel parking lot and sees a lot of bugs at 4am on the way to the launch ramp on the weekends. If I thought it would stay clean for even a day, I'd wash it!"
