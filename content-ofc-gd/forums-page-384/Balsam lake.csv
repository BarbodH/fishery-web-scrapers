The slot on Balsam is working, every fish I caught was between 17 and 22 inches:clapping: .Stayed at the park , going during the week is definately the way to go:thumbsup_anim: , when friday came it turned into a car alarm,dog barking, screaming kid fest . Anyone else having any luck ?   Off topic....was talking to a fellow fisherman at the launch and he suggested going to Simcoe for bass? any ideas where to start?"
