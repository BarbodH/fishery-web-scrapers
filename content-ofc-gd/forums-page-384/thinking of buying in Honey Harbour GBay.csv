716673,Pikeslayer,2012-07-21 01:58:00,1443, Sounds like a case for JUDGE JUDY.  http://www.judgejudy.com/submit_your_case
703592,lew,2012-06-07 15:15:00,12766," I've seen the pictures and the fish is huge.  You don't need to waste your time explaining yourself as far as I'm concerned Bruce and if you did post the pic, or even if your bud posted it, we all know a few guys would just destroy the post anyways.  And it usually happens from all the wannabe's too."
703619,bigbuck,2012-06-07 16:53:00,2449,"Thanks Lew. I'm done with the thread. If the OP wants or needs any more info on the area, he can PM, we are headed up tonight for an extended weekend."
703638,John,2012-06-07 17:22:00,2956,"This thread is typical of why many of us, myself included, don't post new threads anymore, either fishing or non-fishing. Rarely does a topic that can have varying opinions get off the first page before someone jumps all over it looking to stir things up. I have made many friends on this board, many of whom are still around, some who have decided that they would quietly rather become lurkers and some sadly who are gone altogether. This is still a good place to be IMHO, BUT, some of us are making it increasingly difficult for me to click on the OFC bookmark in the morning."
706583,waso,2012-06-17 16:15:00,44,"I appreciate all the responses.  After careful consideration and the proper inspections and some due diligence, we put an offer in on the cottage.  After some back and forth it was accepted and we firmed up on friday.  Close in september, super stoked! However lots of blood, sweat and tears on the horizon!  Cheers"
706649,bigbuck,2012-06-17 19:54:00,2449,Congratulations to you and your family. You'll enjoy the area. There's plenty to do within a very short distance. Which cottage on Mermaid? I'm always tooling around on the weekends. Beige Larson fishn'ski w/ a green top.
706666,Billy Bob,2012-06-17 21:19:00,5865,"When can I come and visit for a long weekend.........LOL...  GOOD LUCK and catch lots of fish, Bob"
706979,waso,2012-06-18 20:19:00,44," Gray and white with the gray boathouse that is in need of repair. I believe it is ""Maclean"" cottage. I run a black and white starcraft, black top. I'll look for your boat!"
707003,bigbuck,2012-06-18 21:00:00,2449,The one right across from marina row towards the bottleneck??
707073,waso,2012-06-18 23:48:00,44," My slip is at Nautilis.  You would head out towards Royal Island and sweep around Mermaid.  It looks straight at Beausoliel island, right down the slow zone to the outer channel (kinda on the corner of a mini bay)."
707102,Twocoda,2012-06-19 01:08:00,4130,Congrates on the purchase... May your memories be many!
707126,bigbuck,2012-06-19 01:54:00,2449,I know where you are. I go up that channel on occasion going to or coming back from North Bay. We' have to wet a line sometime. We are up pretty much every weekend from may twofer till thanksgiving.
707196,fisherman7,2012-06-19 11:40:00,325," Here's my observation - I've been watching the Simcoe, Couch and Port Severn/Honey Harbour real estate market since September 2010. I took a job in Barrie with the intent of moving to the area when my wife finds a job in her field. Almost all the waterfront homes I've been following since 2010 have not sold with some being on the market for over 2 years. Why - IMHO they are way overpriced. The owners still think that the baby-boomers from the GTA are coming with wads of cash to buy their properties. That ended in 2007 with the market crash. Now the BB are fueling the GTA condo market. I've watched some prices drop $50k and still no buyers.  So when it comes time to buy I'll be making an offer that is reasonable but I doubt the owners will think so."
707226,BillM,2012-06-19 13:22:00,17367,"There will always be people with money, no way you'll find waterfront realestate become 'cheap' anytime soon."
707382,Billy Bob,2012-06-19 21:17:00,5865," The BUYER sets the price......not the seller.....  Homes here don't last 2 weeks on the market with interest rates as low as 3%.....my sister just sold her home for their asking price on their own....no leachy realtor to give a commission to,,,"
707537,waso,2012-06-20 12:00:00,44," let's just say that my offer was not reasonable and we haggled from there.  Right circumstances, softening market and you can get a deal."
707539,waso,2012-06-20 12:02:00,44," Where is your place?  Stop by the cottage when i take it over in September, look for my starcraft."
707544,woodenboater,2012-06-20 12:10:00,2277,"what BB said. List/asking price is just a number that agents come up, some realistic, some strategic. For example. some homes in Toronto are going for 100k -200k over asking and some are straight up offers, no wars. Does this mean all homes on the same street are worth that ? Was the starting price fair market ? Maybe not. If the market deems a price unrealisitic, it will sit. and sit. and sit.  Am dealing with this right now with late father in laws property in Australia. Very soft market and price has been dropped twice. Think the agent wasn't the sharpest knife in the block either    but it's not our responsibility since we're half a world away. Couple of years ago, would have gotten asking +. Not today...  As for cottage property prices, I don't ever see them going down, may plateau but that's it."
707594,bigbuck,2012-06-20 14:06:00,2449," We have a trailer at Bluewater Resort, it's in the little bay just beside Paragon Marina with the big cruisers and the town dock. Good for you for chiseling on the price, the real estate agents up there are notorious for overpricing. I'll see ya when I see ya up there in September, I'll keep an eye out for your boat."
707629,waso,2012-06-20 15:52:00,44," I know the spot.  You'll see me around all summer, still renting till September. My daughter likes going to the town centre or picnic island for poutine.  i also head into north bay to fish.  I'll look for your boat."
707639,NAW,2012-06-20 16:21:00,4022,Congrets man!  You'll have almost enless areas to explore with your family.
707706,waso,2012-06-20 19:55:00,44,I want to thank everyone for the well wishes! We are looking forward to this new adventure!
715040,Terry,2012-07-16 20:22:00,14456,"  as it turned out we got to talk to Bruce  we told him everything we could remember from this post  he seemed to remember the fish, but he says is was under the legal size?  when 61"" was said, he said not on his watch...must be a different fish and different CO, so I don't know what to say.."
715097,bigbuck,2012-07-16 22:45:00,2449, Hmpfff! I spoke to him early last summer and he had a good chuckle about it. Ol' Jerry couldn't get it in the boat by himself and had help from him and the OPP officer on the boat took a pic. I'm going to see him over the next couple of weeks and I will refresh his memory. He isn't the nicest of guys to those he doesn't know. Ask irish about that.
715107,Billy Bob,2012-07-16 23:33:00,5865,Could he be Bruce Wayne.....
716619,GbayGiant,2012-07-20 23:43:00,1780,"That was easy. I spoke to Bruce Ward today over the phone and this is what he said to me about Jerryâ€™s fish. ""We came up on a guy last fall out front of --- ---- ---- with a fish in his boat. We got out and helped him release the fish as it appeared to me that he intended to keep it. I helped him cut the hooks out of the fish and we measured it. It was of 'sub legal' for the Bay. It swam away. Luckily for him as I intended to 'charged him' with 'constraining a non legal fish. It barely swam away. Luckily for the person who caught it as he had it in his boat when we pulled up. I asked Bruce  what constraining was and he told me that if it died in his boat he would have been fined as he should have cut what he could and let it go with the  hooks in or out.  Another 61 inch fable set to rest.   Cheers"
702701,waso,2012-06-04 14:17:00,44,"Hi All, I am looking at buying a cottage in honey harbour, Gbay.  We have rented in the outer islands for a while and love the area.  Would like to hear opinions on the fishing and what you think of the area in general. Also any suggestions of guides I could hire to help learn the area better and techniques, if i decide to purchase.  Cheers"
702760,captpierre,2012-06-04 16:47:00,2521,Make sure you have deep water at the end of the dock in case of significant water level fluctuations in the Bay
702816,Christopheraaron,2012-06-04 19:44:00,3525,Deep water also helps with the fishing.
702823,jimmer,2012-06-04 20:06:00,2730,I have many fond memories of that area. The best memory I have is exploring all the nooks and crannies of that part of the bay. The opportunities are endless and I am very envious!
702825,NAW,2012-06-04 20:09:00,4022,It's a great area for fishing and exploring.  Lots of good pike fishing spots.  Lost a beast of a pike boatside earlier this year.  A little to much boat traffic on the weekends for my liking.  Good luck with the purchase if you do end up going for it!
702830,cityfisher,2012-06-04 20:25:00,959, Huge area... lots of great fishing spots and loads of shoals to hit  I do like the area just cant stand the amount of boat traffic on the weekends... Make sure your not on one of the many boat routes ... or you will never have piece and quiet and just have wake and the smell of gas !
702839,Billy Bob,2012-06-04 21:04:00,5865," Cityfisher brings up a very important point here if you're on a high traffic area.....my cousin had a cottage on Chautauqua Lake near the ferry....NEVER had a quite moment all summer long....boats, water skiers, jet bikes all day long....and then the guy next door would cut his grass at night with his riding lawn mower using it's headlight.....  ....needless to say he sold it."
702843,davey buoy,2012-06-04 21:24:00,5505,"Love that area,spent a lot of time fishing,camping,cruising in that area. But you need to buy off the beaten trail as said. The traffic through the channels are wicked all day during the summer season."
703029,bigbuck,2012-06-05 13:11:00,2449,"Lots of places for sale. Depends on your price range. A few cottages have come down in price (ridiculous pricing to begin with). I guess you are looking for a boat to place. Road access cottages are huge dollars. North Bay has some really nice spots and is scenic. As mentioned above, stay away from the channels. It WILL drive you crazy. There's also a nice little bay across from Marina Row that is fairly deep. Lots of good fishing around if you know where to look. We have a trailer in HH and love the area. A cottage there in the future is a definite possibility for us."
703033,bigbuck,2012-06-05 13:13:00,2449,"As for guides, if you are looking for musky, Johnny Dadson is your man. Google him for his website and contact info. You'll need to spend some time learning the waters in the area you settle in."
703044,whiskywizard,2012-06-05 13:57:00,305,"I had a cottage for years on Gloucester Pool, by Big Chute.  Like any other place, Honey Harbour has both pros and cons.   Fantastic boating, with access to the rest of the world. No end of places to explore. Fantastic swimming. Great fishing, but challenging to get to know it. Close to civilization but definitely natural and beautiful scenery. The road traffic to get there, from the GTA, can be awful and there aren't a lot of options on routes to get there. Will you be restricted to weekends? If so, plan on almost 3h each way. Heavy boat traffic as mentioned earlier - I won't belabour that. Personally, I love watching the bigger cruisers so this is both good and bad. Local population fluctuates wildly - from very low in off season and chock-a-block full in summer. On a summer long weekend sometimes it's hard to find a loaf of bread in the smallest stores. G_bay property values will never drop in any significant way, so good investment."
703082,blue pickeral,2012-06-05 17:04:00,267," Demographically, I have to disagree with this. As baby boomers die off, there will be more (and less expensive) property available. The kids and new Canadians are not into the 'cottaging' life style."
703105,waso,2012-06-05 18:29:00,44,"Thanks for the input.  Some great points.  I have fished the area many times and it certainly is tough, that's why i think a guide could help to understand the water better (musky and pike).  The cottage we are looking at has deep water off the dock and is close to the main channel, but out of the way enough (on mermaid island, never could afford a mainland drive to) to not drive us crazy, but we do enjoy the boat watching. Any other points are appreciated!  Cheers"
703139,Billy Bob,2012-06-05 20:21:00,5865,"Take the ""guide"" out a few times BEFORE you purchase property there......then see if it's worth your while......."
703142,landry,2012-06-05 20:28:00,1005, My pop had a cottage on Mermaid for years in the main channel. As long as u are past the channel leading to the delawanna inn and picnic island (as in down towards south bay) or on the back side of the island you will be okay. The fishing is mediocre there IMO but it is very good out towards red rock and giants tomb for smallies. Landry
703282,bigbuck,2012-06-06 13:26:00,2449,"If your looking at Mermaid Island, you should be fine depending on where on the island your looking. There is lots of pike, as for musky, there aren't tons but those that are around are pretty big, not too far from the island you are looking at, a friend of mine managed to land a 61 incher with the help of the MNR and OPP (MNR netted and OPP took the pic). I  landed my 50 incher in the same area."
703287,Gregoire,2012-06-06 13:37:00,1397, I would love to see a pic of that beast.
703393,bigbuck,2012-06-06 20:04:00,2449,I've got one but he doesn't want it floating around the web. It was a beast that's for sure.
703410,GbayGiant,2012-06-06 20:54:00,1780,  Ok for the story to float around but not the picture? There are already lots of stories floatinig around and most are stories. Even with a picture though it would be doubted.
703413,jimmer,2012-06-06 21:02:00,2730,Don't forget that there are rattlesnakes in that area.
703416,danz,2012-06-06 21:11:00,15,Contact Graham Bristow of Geirgian Bay Musky Charters. He is a great guy and incredible musky fisherman with Over 25 years of experience fishing that area.  http://www.anglerspro.ca/html/georgian_bay_musky_charters.html
703419,bigbuck,2012-06-06 21:25:00,2449," Do you know the CO's in the area, if so, ask Bruce about Gerry's monster. I'm respecting a friend's wishes, that's all. Lew has seen the pic. Don't go bashing, its not appreciated."
703444,GbayGiant,2012-06-06 22:55:00,1780,"You missed my point which was. It is OK for you to talk about some fabled Muskie and you can show pictures to guys on this forum, which has zero to do with the fish and talk about some OPP and MNR who were there but you can't show the picture but it's ok to talk about it on the WWW? I'm not sure who is confused more. Myself or you? I would think your friend Gerry wouldn't want you to mention it either on an open forum such as this one. I could be wrong."
703550,Fish4Eyes,2012-06-07 12:08:00,1022,Edit the pic to blank out your buddies face and we wont even know who caught it  . Don't tease us like this
703569,bigbuck,2012-06-07 13:35:00,2449,"GBAy, if you have a problem, PM me.  I don't know you from a hole in the ground and you don't know me either. Those that do know me know that I'm not full of bull. The 'fabled' fish was caught by someone other than myself, if it were me and I had a pic, I'd post it, but it wasn't and he does not want his pic plastered all over the web. I'm not confused, halftimers has not set in yet."
