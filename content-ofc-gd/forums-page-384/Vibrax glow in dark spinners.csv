715810,redpearl99,2012-07-18 19:06:00,259,no thoughts?
715815,zamboniwaterboy,2012-07-18 19:24:00,126,Have not tried these ones but the ones I have made have had good results on the French River at night.
715817,Harrison,2012-07-18 19:32:00,2202,"Only glow baits I have ever done well with are spoons off the pier or casting from a boat at night for salmon.  Not saying glows would not work for other species at night, but I prefer Black/Dark Profile larger baits."
715818,bassman87,2012-07-18 19:41:00,586,caught brown trout on them from a lake ontario pier
715819,redpearl99,2012-07-18 19:42:00,259,"but wouldn't a glowing lure attract a pike so much more at night than a dark lure?  Also, would these vibrax spinners be good for smallmouth bass (muskoka seems to be full of them)?"
715826,kickingfrog,2012-07-18 20:04:00,8333,"Pike really aren't a nocturnal predator. That doesn't meen you can't catch them when it's dark, but it's not the most productive method."
715834,GreenCanada,2012-07-18 20:17:00,375,"I like Vibrax spinners, but don't waste your money on ones with painted/decalled blades.  From my experience (easily 20+ vibrax spinners) painted/decalled blades ALWAYS have the paint chip off within a couple dozen casts. By this I mean casts that only encounter water. No rocks, no boat, no weeds, nothing, just water. Last year I emailed the President of Blue Fox, which is Normark, which is Rapala, etc to enquire about this constant problem with the quality of their product. The response I got was to mail the lure(s) to them at my expense and then they would ship me another. Why would I waste my money to ship it to them, when it costs about the same to buy a new one?  My advice: try to find something similar but in a Panther Martin. I've never been disappointed with their products or service"
715838,kickingfrog,2012-07-18 20:24:00,8333,Another option is to paint your own existing spinners.
715854,GreenCanada,2012-07-18 21:21:00,375," I'm embarrassed to say that this idea never even entered my mind...  But now that it has, where is my girlfriends nailpolish!!!"
715865,lew,2012-07-18 21:59:00,12766,"I've spent decades fishing after dark and have always done very well, and have never used glow in the dark type lures.  Use baits that give off good vibrations and slow down your retrieve and you'll do just fine."
715867,davey buoy,2012-07-18 22:01:00,5505,"I'm a big mepps fan as well as blue fox.I tried my #5 mepps ""glow"" in all types of water clarity and has yet to reward me even a rock bass. Not completely sold on the glow technology yet."
715872,kickingfrog,2012-07-18 22:10:00,8333," It works, but your choices will be dictated by fashion not fishing... unless you go buy your own."
715880,Ralph Field,2012-07-18 22:33:00,1018,They sell glo in the dark paint at CT.
715907,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-07-19 00:36:00,310,I bet this would work great for after dark walleyes.
716143,GreenCanada,2012-07-19 18:48:00,375, Have you found a particular brand that adheres to the lures best?
716168,Snidley,2012-07-19 19:51:00,620,"I have not used Blue Fox glow in the dark spinners but I have used Mepps glow spinners and they worked at the Notty. The Mepps glow paint is not bright, just a subtle glow that makes them slightly more visible. The fish species that respond best to Glow paint are Salmon and trout. Personally it's glow spoons that really perform for me and the fish species that likes them best are staging Chinnooks in the lake. I have had good success with commercially produced glow in the dark Hot Shots, Lymans, Kwikfish, and Hot-n-Tots, all for Chinnies. My best glow in the dark producer though is a glow in the dark J-13 painted with glow in the dark paint (on the bottom of the lure)  by me."
716236,kickingfrog,2012-07-19 23:47:00,8333,  My brother works in a cosmetics factory. I get what ever he gets.  Nail polish lasts longer on plastics then metal.

716303,Fisherpete,2012-07-20 03:31:00,1814,"I have done really well on the Mepps glow #5's, caught everything on them - bass, pike, walleye and even muskies. My first tiger muskie actually was caught on one. The funny thing though - not AT NIGHT! I think the fish don't see the white blades as often, and sometimes that something different gets them to bite.  Peter"
716425,Snidley,2012-07-20 14:49:00,620,"That Cdn Tire paint is UV paint which is different than glow paint. UV paint is invisible to our eyes but visable to fish and other creatures. We can see glow paint and it applies to nightime fishing or fishing in stained water, or really deep I would think."
716829,sauce,2012-07-22 02:55:00,219,"I'm sure the glow vibrax will work. Give it a try, its the only way to know for sure. But like others have mentioned, non glow lures might work better. Try shallow running stick baits. Most times you want your presentation above the fish. Sometimes closer to the surface than to the bottom. I've fished places where you could catch fish all night on topwaters..."
