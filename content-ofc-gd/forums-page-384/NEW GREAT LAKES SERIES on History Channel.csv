716054,Billy Bob,2012-07-19 14:31:00,5865,You know.......sometimes you guys get these series later then we do for some stupid reason....
716059,The JAY,2012-07-19 14:47:00,239,"Looking forward to seeing it. It will air later on the Canadian History Channel, but what can you do.... Would have been nice if the reporter did a little fact checking though, or did they move Thunder Bay down to Lake O while I was sleeping?"
716253,bucktail,2012-07-20 00:54:00,1857,"Unfortanely it is the fall up here, just checked tonight.  But extreme Treasure Hnuter is on tonight, a fantastic show!!"
716372,Billy Bob,2012-07-20 12:49:00,5865,I watched it last night......IMHO you guys didn't miss anything......MAYBE it will get better as the episodes unfold....but I doubt it.
