716080,OhioFisherman,2012-07-19 15:38:00,6623,"I had them real bad in my yard about 6 years ago, I bought traps from home depot, they work! The traps which hold about a quart? were full every couple of days. If they are trapped and disposed of they can`t reproduce? Maybe you can use them for bait?"
716105,solopaddler,2012-07-19 17:08:00,8605,"Well, while I was away in Wawa last week my property has been infested with these things.  Every single shrub in my yard is covered with them except for the ornamental Japanese maple.  How ironic is that."
716133,fisher,2012-07-19 18:17:00,451,"After buying 2 traps last night from Home Depot BUT just before setting them out, I read from numerous sites that putting out these scented traps is a big mistake. It actually attracts beetles from your neighbourhood to head to your backyard and while you will get some/most to die in the trap, some will just use the garden as a buffet and you may end up making the matter worse (currently the beetles are on my grapes and no where else, so I would hate to have others come and attack my other plants).  To prove how effective it is in bringing these beetles in, check out this video...crazy the amount of beetles the trap can attract.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY9vuFVc3FU  So, I just went out during lunch and bought some Bug B Gone as suggested by another poster and will try that tonight."
716134,GreenCanada,2012-07-19 18:20:00,375," I recently visited my grand father in Gravenhurst and he has had issues with them over the past few years, but this year he found out how to prevent them from damaging his trees and shrubs.  This is what the trap looks like. Google search ""japanese bettle trap"" and I'm sure you can find some in your area. http://kollegiatelawn.ca/siteimages/Japanese%20Beetle%20Trap.jpg  It is a hormone trap and they can't escape from it. When it gets full you just drown the beetles and put it back up. When I was there, I saw at least 20 or so beetles flying around each one. This was in addition to about 50 in the trap. He empties it once every day or so (whenever it gets full).  He has just over half an acre and I believe has 3 set up. He can't say enough good things about them.  *edit* added link"
716205,spincast,2012-07-19 21:29:00,3279,I was researching the little buggers this morning - detroying my grass  My link how to interrupt the life cycle.
716266,bigugli,2012-07-20 01:22:00,6138,"The Hormone traps work great, if you set them on the outer edges of the property. The japanese beetle comes in from neighbouring properties homing in on the scents of plants and flowers. The hormone trap triggers reproductive attraction. I have used them with great success in protecting commercial nurseries, berry farms and garden centres. You must empty the traps every day. Spraying the grapes with Ortho, Bug B Gone, etc,,, may not be advisable, if you plan on eating the grapes."

716306,Skipper D,2012-07-20 03:50:00,1970,  Its been our belive Lew that they were to keep rabbits out of the garden more so then bugs ............
716308,danc,2012-07-20 03:57:00,4677,"Fortunatey there's none of them up here, but the Earwigs are running rampant. I've seen one until about a decade ago and now they're everywhere. Nasty looking creatures they are."
716503,FisherJuli,2012-07-20 18:05:00,125,"I have had them this year for the first time ever- they are destructive especially on new rosebush growth.  I did read that if you catch them, to put them in a pail of suds and water, which serves to 1. Kill them, 2. Give off a bad smell to repel others. I have this nasty bug brew near my rosebush for 2 weeks now, and since I did that, their numbers have dwindled. With that said, find another couple daily. They're a nuisance, and destructive.  For the record, I have caught at least a couple hundred, and haven't been bitten by one, either- whew!"
716519,Christopheraaron,2012-07-20 18:27:00,3525,"Ya, just got em, they are all over my neighbors' grapes among other plants, and none on the japanese maple! has anyone tried them as bait yet?"
715990,fisher,2012-07-19 12:24:00,451,Does anyone have any experience with dealing with these beetles.  I am in Woodbridge and they invaded my grape vine.  About 50% of the leaves have been chewed and skeletonized before I noticed what was happening.  Last night I spent 2 hours picking them off my vines and have no doubt there are going to be more when I get back home tonight.  Any ideas?  Online they say that picking them off works best and using the beetle traps that they sell at Home Depot which gives off an attractant scent is actually a bad thing because it will attract beetles from all over the neighbourhood into my backyard and make things worse.
715996,grimsbylander,2012-07-19 12:34:00,3016,"Hey Fisher, I noticed my birch was dropping leaves last Friday and thought it was strange but with all this dry weather paid little attention. I came back from fishing Saturday and my jaw dropped when I looked at the tree! It was literally being eaten alive. There were thousands of them on it and the linden tree beside it. It would have been impossible to hand pick that many bugs off a 15ft tree. All I had was grub killer for the lawn, so I nailed it. The tree was going to die if I didn't do something. They dropped like, well, flies. They garden underneath is covered in dead bugs. I also did the linden with the same results. It's been 4 days without a single beetle back. I have no idea why I'm seeing them now for the first time ever."
716001,fisher,2012-07-19 12:40:00,451,Do you recall the brand of grub killer that you used?  Is it powdered or liquid?  I am willing to try anything - my vine is over 10 years old and loaded with grapes and I would hate to lose it to these bugs.  I am in Woodbridge and have been here for over 12 years and never seen them before...hope this is not going to be an annual event!
716003,UglyBug,2012-07-19 12:41:00,148,Those buggers bite so be careful.
716004,Ralph Field,2012-07-19 12:41:00,1018,"My wife used a product called bug off and it did the trick, at least for now. As mentioned earlier many trees in our area are covered in them. With the dry weather and now the beadles the trees are very stressed."
716014,fisher,2012-07-19 12:54:00,451,They do not bite.  I picked up at least 200-300 of them last night with my bare hand and the only thing they did was dig in with their prickly legs (likely designed to help them hold on to the leaves when shaken/disturbed).  I even had one crawling on my back which I only noticed when I went inside to take a shower.
716016,Christopheraaron,2012-07-19 12:56:00,3525,Any pics of the tree? I'm curious to see what you're dealing with.
716017,BillM,2012-07-19 13:01:00,17367,This is your only option.  
716020,grimsbylander,2012-07-19 13:02:00,3016,  I don't recall and I'm at work right now. It was a liquid though. Just hooked it up to the garden hose and go.
716021,UglyBug,2012-07-19 13:06:00,148,"Well sorry but they do bite, you might not be sweet enough for them. I have been bite so I know. might not be common but they do  "
716026,Christopheraaron,2012-07-19 13:17:00,3525, Maybe you just have a few extra plant chromosomes!
716028,fisher,2012-07-19 13:19:00,451," I guess you may be right...my statement was based on the fact that they did not bite me even though I literally picked up over 200 of them with my bare hands and at times, struggled to loosen them off their grip on the leaves."
716030,NAW,2012-07-19 13:21:00,4022,Thanks for starting this post.  They are all over my wife's rose bushes.  They have nearly killed 4 of them.  Little buggers..
716032,UglyBug,2012-07-19 13:26:00,148,No worries here. I generally hate bugs so I guess they knew that. 
716033,fisher,2012-07-19 13:27:00,451,"Christopher, Here is a link I found online to a picture that will show you the leaf and a beetle  http://www.google.ca/imgres?q=japanese+beetles+grape+leaf&um=1&hl=en&safe=active&rlz=1R2ADFA_enCA480&biw=981&bih=507&tbm=isch&tbnid=IkYmGleQq0f5iM:&imgrefurl=http://www.blueelephantfarm.com/1/post/2011/7/japanese-beetles.html&docid=FaVaRV1J_ZbuPM&itg=1&imgurl=http://www.blueelephantfarm.com/uploads/5/6/6/1/5661257/1310750563.jpg&w=289&h=212&ei=wgoIUMGzH-WR0QGvn83aAw&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=703&vpy=157&dur=563&hovh=169&hovw=231&tx=132&ty=79&sig=101573096497534417619&page=4&tbnh=154&tbnw=223&start=34&ndsp=12&ved=1t:429,r:7,s:34,i:206"
716044,Christopheraaron,2012-07-19 14:01:00,3525,"Thanks fisher, strange I've never seen any around here."
716055,doubleheader,2012-07-19 14:32:00,497,"Given you have the infestation go to the lawn and garden dept of any retailer and get a spray. read the directions to make sure it's effective on the beetles, then, get a couple beetle bags and mount them nearby your vine. the beetles can't resist them, fly in, and croak. My neighbor and I have adjacent gardens. He planted marigolds around his garden which is like an open invitation for japanese beetles to attack. Fortunately we've been able to control it with the above actions."
716057,lew,2012-07-19 14:39:00,12766, Interesting you say that Fred as a neighbor just told me wife recently that marigolds planted in a vegetable garden would keep bugs away.
716060,Musky or Specks,2012-07-19 14:56:00,2710,This is in clear violation of the Washington Treaty hopefully your deck will be their Midway....... Sorry couldn't resist a little history buff humour
716066,kickingfrog,2012-07-19 15:04:00,8333, Someone I work with said marigolds would keep rabbits out of my veg garden. Since I haven't had rabbits in the 3 years I've had the garden I didn't really consider it.
716068,soobnoob,2012-07-19 15:06:00,55,"Heres a little known secret.... DISH SOAP http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/insect/05547.html/  My dad uses this in the garden, works like a charm... xept for the darn squirrels"
716070,The JAY,2012-07-19 15:08:00,239,"  I would say that about Crysanthemums. There is a chemical in them, Pyrethrum, that deters/kills bugs. It is the main compound in most lice treatments, and the plant itself is usually enough of a deterrent. Just my 2 cents...."
716073,doubleheader,2012-07-19 15:12:00,497," My neighbors marigolds were polluted with them. Maybe you're supposed to plant them away from the garden, in which case i could see that they would steer them away from the veggies, but he has them planted right on the garden's edge. BTW Lew, we're down to what, 15 days. Hope to see you while we're up at Memquisit."
716076,doubleheader,2012-07-19 15:14:00,497, Dish soap was the 1st thing we tried. It helped but did not clear them out.
716078,lew,2012-07-19 15:18:00,12766, It's getting close Fred and let's make a point of getting out together again this year. The waters alot higher so we'll be able to get back into some of the better spots unlike 2 years ago.  Sorry to the OP for the hijack
