437534,Rich Clemens,2010-02-26 21:58:00,3131,  Good Deal
437535,Mattones,2010-02-26 21:59:00,587,"All I gotta say is, Where Canadian. We like our beer and having a great time!   If they do get rid of the womans hockey ill be SOUR! I actually would rather watch the womans then the males. I enjoy watching them."

437548,scuro2,2010-02-26 22:16:00,904," Ice, beer, hockey, beavers...that is about as Canadian photo as there ever will be!"
437549,Rich Clemens,2010-02-26 22:20:00,3131,"Trust me.  I won't tell any of them to have the clothes washed, house cleaned, and a hot meal on the table when I come home."
437315,The Urban Fisherman,2010-02-26 14:45:00,2050,"I say give them a break!  They deserve to celebrate!  Ps.  I coached Tessa Bonhomme #25 in highschool girls hockey, and I'm going to go ahead and assume that that's why they won gold! haha  http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/spo...post-game-party"
437317,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-26 14:52:00,4399,"Good for them they deserve to let their hair down, thumbs down to the stuffed shirts at the IOC!!!"

437321,bigfish1965,2010-02-26 14:54:00,3382,"This will blow over and be forgotten. Who cares if they had some beer afterwards?? I would expect no different. If there was ever a well deserved brew, that was definitely it. I would have bought them all one myself if I'd been there!!!"
437322,Dara,2010-02-26 14:55:00,3052,Party on girls...you worked for it
437330,JohnF,2010-02-26 15:07:00,3494,"Those who don't like it can pound salt. Who can blame them for being in a celebratory mood. This is probably the biggest thing they work for, unlike our hockey men who get paid millions to chase a whole series of huge awards throughout their playing careers.  As one American commentator said ""Would anyone get upset if Sidney Crosby lit up a cigar and popped a beer after such a big win?"" I paraphrased a bit but that's what he said, and I agree. If it had been one of my kids on the team I'd have been buying the beer and cigars. And let's not have any of that ""ladies"" nonsense. Ladies don't kick butt on the ice like that.  And for Rogge and all the other uptight Olympic jaggoffs to use the platform of the girls' win to threaten to pull the sport from the Olympics because two teams are dominating is hypocritical crap. Look around Europe at the dominance they gloat about in certain events, but does anyone threaten to drop those events? Of course not, and the North Americans are starting to get a wedge in the door after years of perseverance, like the American who just won a cross country ski event.  So, to paraphrase another columnist ""Get over it. They deserve to celebrate.""  JF"

437340,Rich Clemens,2010-02-26 15:32:00,3131,I don't blame them for celebrating.  The ladies worked hard for it so let them live and enjoy their accomplishments.
437356,Jonny,2010-02-26 15:59:00,1380,"Canadian girls drinking beer and smoking stogies... shocking!!!  I've got two words for the IOC but the board software would filter the expression.  The second word is ""off""."
437382,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-26 16:52:00,4399," That would be ""take off eh"""
437384,Fish4Eyes,2010-02-26 16:56:00,1022,"The media always needs something to talk about. Everyone else around them is drinking, why can't they? Nothing like the good old Oilers days when the players were snorting rails in the locker room to get fired up."
437440,crappieperchhunter,2010-02-26 19:08:00,2582,"Just saw the pictures of the on ice celebrations. Looked like good clean fun to me.  I'm sure the biggest problem is the underage thing. Somebody has pointed that out, so now the powers that be have to act on it cause it is there responsibility.  To me this is one of those instances where you just smile and let the girls have some fun.  A little lecture and finger wagging behind closed doors, should be all that comes out of this. Someone has to do there job, they'll do it, and all will be forgotten."
437444,Headhunter,2010-02-26 19:27:00,5703,Party on ladies! I'm am just glad that the IOC wan't at Bernie's place last weekend! HH

437449,irishfield,2010-02-26 19:33:00,26272,"If they, the IOC, didn't want this to happen.... the booze wouldn't be there in the first place since it's liquor other than residence no matter how they look at it. That said... pass the bottle!!  Like John said.. no body would give it a second look if it was the men's team doing the same thing. Heck.. they probably handed the gals the cigars!!"
437452,ketchenany,2010-02-26 19:35:00,3229,  You were playing Hockey?
