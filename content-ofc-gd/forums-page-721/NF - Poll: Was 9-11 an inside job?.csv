I was just curious to see what OFC thinks about the subject now that 8 years have past since the tragedy. Please vote for one of the two options in the poll that you lean more towards.  I would like this thread to remain civil and not be locked due to bickering amongst the members, so please vote in the poll but don't trash the thread.  Thanks."
