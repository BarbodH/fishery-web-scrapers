437565,JohnF,2010-02-26 22:58:00,3494, Am I the only one who doesn't know what that means?  JF
437606,kickingfrog,2010-02-27 00:25:00,8333, That's Betman's plan. Stupid ice hole!
437717,Daplumma,2010-02-27 03:52:00,1961,Good stuff..Bring on the HOSERS! Joe
437817,Billy Bob,2010-02-27 16:54:00,5865,Well it don't get any better than this now that the Canadians are in the Gold medal round with USA boys.....and the Canadians I'm sure will be playing mad.... with there talent and if Miller has a Miller day this game could go either way in a one goal game. Either way it's a WIN WIN for both countries and for the sport of Hockey itself..  Good Luck My Canadian Anglers tomorrow should be your day.  Bob  BTW who's going ice fishing tomorrow......  I didn't think so..
437820,bigfish1965,2010-02-27 17:01:00,3382,I was amazed at how much the server load went down during last nites game...as soon as the game was over the sudden jump cause a momentary overload...lol
437481,bigfish1965,2010-02-26 20:22:00,3382,"4-0 halfway through the first period. With Miller in net, this one can be put to bed. Impressive!!"
437485,figureight,2010-02-26 20:28:00,40,6 - 0
437486,Harrison,2010-02-26 20:30:00,2202,YOU OWE ME A BEER!  Wife can clear the PVR now!
437489,jonnybass,2010-02-26 20:31:00,346,"Canada - USA gold medal match.  Now all we need is the guys from the movie ""celtic pride"" to take care of Miller."
437490,bigfish1965,2010-02-26 20:34:00,3382,Maybe all the guys from Team Canada will buy Miller several Millers to celebrate .. just enough for a three day hangover..lol.
437493,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-26 20:40:00,2690,"I'd say they are trying to send a message to our boys.  A Canada/US final would be amazing...first we have to take care of Slovakia.  Wow, I was Wilson, I would be tempted to pull Miller...let him rest up."
437494,blaque,2010-02-26 20:45:00,2419,"I'd say that was a good period.......although watching it streaming online stinks lol I actually came on here and saw this post and saw 6-0? and looked at my coworker and he said, No i got 4-0 still!?!?! I said me too?!?!?"
437495,bigfish1965,2010-02-26 20:46:00,3382," If the Fins score a goal, he will. Have to give him a chance at building towards a record for most shut-outs."
437496,Whopper,2010-02-26 20:49:00,2174,I was really hoping before the game starting that USA men wouldn't look past this game Just glad they came ready to play
437500,Marty,2010-02-26 20:54:00,873,C'mon Canada!    A Canada - U.S. final would be too cool.      I could find a reason to be happy for both teams winning.
437504,Governator,2010-02-26 20:57:00,879,It's like Kipper vs an All-Star team.  Finns did not show up.
437507,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-26 21:07:00,10439,"  Not needed, I have paid off key personal to spike his water bottle with laxitives during the game. He'll be on the crapper by the end of the third shift!!!!!"
437511,kickingfrog,2010-02-26 21:13:00,8333,I'm about 30 minutes behind live tv right now and I'm not reading any of the above responses. But...  The yanks just scored their 6th. I would have thought that once they got their bronze medal the Finish womens team would have got home?
437513,bigfish1965,2010-02-26 21:19:00,3382,I wonder if they are going to pull mens hockey out of the Olympics now too.
437517,blaque,2010-02-26 21:33:00,2419, I was jusst about to post that Rick LOL
437538,Rich Clemens,2010-02-26 22:05:00,3131,Any update on the score of the USA game ?        Darn thing ain't televised on any channels I get.
437539,irishfield,2010-02-26 22:05:00,26272, Don't pull a TJ... Canada hasn't advanced yet...
437541,bigfish1965,2010-02-26 22:11:00,3382, 6-1 Rich...30 seconds left
437544,Rich Clemens,2010-02-26 22:12:00,3131,Thanks Rick.   I sure hope I can catch your game tonite.
437546,bigfish1965,2010-02-26 22:14:00,3382, If I knew where it was streamed I'd post a link for you....
437547,Rich Clemens,2010-02-26 22:16:00,3131,"I checked our listings and I should be able to pick it up. Appreciate the score update.    We did our part, now we'll look to our Canadian friends to do the same. Sure hope we see you again on Sunday.   Should be better than any Super Bowl Party."
437560,Twocoda,2010-02-26 22:43:00,4130,for those south of the border  http://www.ctvolympics.ca/hockey/index.html
437562,JohnF,2010-02-26 22:50:00,3494, Don't count on it. When I tried to watch the Juniors from Cleveland it was blocked. I suspect you need a Canadian IP addy. Hope I'm wrong.  JF
437563,bigfish1965,2010-02-26 22:53:00,3382,Use a canadian proxy...lots of them around
437564,Twocoda,2010-02-26 22:54:00,4130,what Rick said will work ....thats what i do when i want to watch american stuff online
