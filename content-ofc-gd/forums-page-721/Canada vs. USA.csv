438098,muskymike,2010-02-28 15:42:00,772,"Stuck in Ottawa (wishing I was back in the GTA), I will be sitting at home with a few friends (Americans) coming over to watch the game.  Since pretty much all of us will be watching today at 3:15 PM I am curious, what are you doing for this momentous occasion?  Staying home or going out?"
438099,Daplumma,2010-02-28 15:45:00,1961,At home by the woodstove.Going to have to TIVO the race though. Joe
438100,danc,2010-02-28 15:48:00,4677,I'll be watching at home. I'll most likely have the NASCAR race on the hdtv and be watching the hockey game on my laptop. I've watched quite a bit of the olympics on my laptop and the picture quality is great. GO CANADA!!!
438101,muskymike,2010-02-28 16:00:00,772,"Forgive me as I am not into NASCAR at all, I dont follow, I dont watch, I have no clue what is going on.  Today is the Las Vegas Race correct? Is it a big event? Big enough to have on during Canada vs. USA for the Gold Medal in the Olympics?  Sorry if I am being ignorant here, I am just uneducated with respect to NASCAR."
438103,Roy,2010-02-28 16:04:00,13728,"Yup, I'll be by the fireside watching it with my feet up ...maybe even a brew or two!"
438105,Ziki,2010-02-28 16:12:00,128,ughh nascar... i think i just got a little dumber.   GO CANADA!
438106,danc,2010-02-28 16:13:00,4677," Every race is a big event. Depends where your priorieties fall I guess. I'm sure that I'll have the hockey game on the big screen at times too, but I can't watch the race on the laptop, so the only way for me to watch both is with the game on the laptop."
438107,Pigeontroller,2010-02-28 16:14:00,2793,I thought only ignorant rednecks from Hogsweat Alabama watched nascar???   GO CANADA GO!
438108,Billy Bob,2010-02-28 16:14:00,5865,Canadians should NOT be interested in NASCAR....that's a Redneck sport and it's the only Sport you can follow when you're HAMMERED....LOOK ANOTHER LEFT TURN...
438109,kickingfrog,2010-02-28 16:20:00,8333,"From the TOP of the podium, where else?"
438126,ehg,2010-02-28 17:01:00,2666,Yes! Who isn't going to watch?
438130,irishfield,2010-02-28 17:06:00,26272,Me Erik... wife and I picked today as Valentine's day a couple weeks back....when she gave me a by on the 14th to pack for Temagami.  Needless to say... Hockey is gonna take a second seat today...  ..might flip on that Nascar thingy though!!
438137,Sandbag,2010-02-28 17:20:00,533,Just prepping the wings and Pizza now as we speak.  Watching at home fireside....have my Team Canada jersey on and ready to roll.  My wife is even excited about the game...sweeeeeeet  Cheers  Craig
438143,camillj,2010-02-28 17:27:00,1988, Jeeze Wayne what could be more romantic than screaming LUUUUUUUUUUUU  .. and Yea BABY !!!!!! every 10 minutes or so .... anyways ... was the Temagami trip good ... I musta missed the report .... specially the part about BIG-ARSSS Specks ....   Oh .. and yes .. I'll be glued to the Aquos in HD ... with a bottle of Grey Goose and a bucket of ice within reach
438149,Rich Clemens,2010-02-28 17:34:00,3131,Will be sittin' at home.  I hope it's over before all the kids and grand-kids come for supper (total chaos and high noise levels).   I hope both teams come out and play at the top of their game.   Should be an exciting one.
438171,joonmoon,2010-02-28 18:16:00,528,"Everthing on the honey-do list gets put on hold for THE game and the final day of the games. My better half, our beagle buddy and I will be settling in on the couch and lazyboy chair shortly with plenty of snacks and munchies. Everything else just doesn't matter....this is our game."
