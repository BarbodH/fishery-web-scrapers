It turns out women can and regularly do, out jump the guys. The IOC has excluded women because they say it may have an adverse effect on their reproductive organs. Clearly this person has never been hit in the nads by a puck. More info in this article. I think if anything we found this winter olympics had as much if not more entertainment and competition in the womens sports."
438124,Roy,2010-02-28 16:58:00,13728, You got that right for sure!
438152,Fisherman,2010-02-28 17:38:00,7201,"I think it's just part of nature that women should be jumping guys all the time, never mind the bangy boards, they just get in the way."
438195,bigugli,2010-02-28 18:43:00,6138,"The problem with part of the IOC is the 3rd world reps who view women as property.  Don't look good for women to outdo men, or to compete in events similar to men's.  Kinda like a black runner embarassing, and humiliating, the Nazi propaganda machine at the '36 Olympics right in front of Adolph's face."
438207,Billy Bob,2010-02-28 19:12:00,5865,Of course women jump farther then men...that's why there so darn hard to catch.
438228,Twocoda,2010-02-28 19:50:00,4130, Diamonds are a good lure Billybob....considering the cost of them though ....do ya really want to catch one????or set a few traps for multiples
