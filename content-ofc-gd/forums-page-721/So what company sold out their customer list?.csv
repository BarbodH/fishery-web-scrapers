437805,camillj,2010-02-27 16:13:00,1988,I bought a Humminbird .. LOVE it .. registered it and havent seen a spit of spam (from them)... but then I have my spam filters on seek-and-destroy .. so I only get 500 to 600 a day now
437811,Billy Bob,2010-02-27 16:38:00,5865,"I agree 100% with going to Gmail....I use to have Hotmail and when I got a spam email I would click that it was spam...next day same thing, OVER and OVER....Hotmail sucked....got up one day turned on the computer and ALL my Hotmail was GONE...like I never even had a account with them before....at the time both my sons were going to college and I had a lot of IMPORTANT correspondence with the two colleges they were going to for financing......trying to contact Hotmail only proved to be a big waste of time....no one response from them........  NOW I am a happy camper with Gmail........just click the SPAM button once and you never see that spam again..."

437836,Twocoda,2010-02-27 18:02:00,4130,im getting them too ...but i was thinking cuz i signed an online petition regarding asian carp ....ever since then im getting hammered
437871,jonnybass,2010-02-27 20:48:00,346,"This should be easy to figure out. If we get enough people who received the email to post in this thread and state where they dropped their email addresses, we can quickly isolate and reveal the spamming company that sold out their list. It's simple. Just find the company that everyone has in common."
437597,irishfield,2010-02-27 00:15:00,26272,  Anyone else just get the same??
437601,mbac31,2010-02-27 00:16:00,904,I did to. Not sure from wher but starting to tick me off.
437603,Syn,2010-02-27 00:17:00,519,I'm not worried. Just got an email from a Nigerian price who promised to reward me handsomely $$$ if I forward him some money.
437604,irishfield,2010-02-27 00:18:00,26272,LOL Syn... I'm not worried either.. just won't deal with the company if we find out whom !
437607,BillM,2010-02-27 00:25:00,17367,"I registered my graph on Humminbird a few months back, but this was the first email I've ever received from them..  Was yours about some Kevin Van Dame seminar or something?"
437608,irishfield,2010-02-27 00:29:00,26272,Yep..and my email address is in Capitals...
437609,Bill Shearer,2010-02-27 00:30:00,456,Have you filled out any ballots at any of the recent shows?
437612,irishfield,2010-02-27 00:32:00,26272,Never that stupid. It's either a fishing supply house we have all ordered from... or TJ's contest entries... or Bass what ever it was magazine we got for awhile here by entering their offerings a year or more back.
437626,bigfish1965,2010-02-27 00:49:00,3382,"Not necessarily sold out. Could have been harvested. In either case, use GMail and don't worry about it."
437629,irishfield,2010-02-27 00:51:00,26272,What is Gmail going to do Rick.. if that's the email address you use to enter a contest... or as an order contact... it's no different that the address I'm using now if someone sells out or harvest the email list.
437630,mbac31,2010-02-27 00:51:00,904,Nice. My freekin wife was filling out those dam things while I was working at the show. Great.
437633,irishfield,2010-02-27 00:52:00,26272, LOL... no fear.. your email is fine! BUT.. your phone is gonna ring off the hook....
437638,bigfish1965,2010-02-27 00:56:00,3382," Google(GMail) has the largest database of spammers on earth. If something gets through once, click the spam button and never get anything from them again. These companies do not do their own emailing,,they hire it out"

437656,T Fisher,2010-02-27 01:28:00,139,"If you ever post anything for sale on Kijiji, The Buy and Sell or Gregslist youll be bombarded with spam."
437659,irishfield,2010-02-27 01:31:00,26272, Nope.. not that.
437662,xeon,2010-02-27 01:34:00,350,Johnson Outdoors owns Humminbird.  
437663,Spiel,2010-02-27 01:35:00,9065,I feel so left out.
437664,Roy,2010-02-27 01:36:00,13728,I didn't get any mail...I feel cheated.
437667,cram,2010-02-27 01:41:00,1733,"Did you register your humminbird with them?  If so, that's likely where it came from.  Stores sell data all the time though. Ever get asked for your postal code at point of sale?  Its for them to figure out what to put in the flyers that land on the doorsteps in your neighbourhood.  Many retailers share this info with others.  InfoUSA is actually a pretty big company that aggregates information like this  (from retailers, credit card companies, or just stuff on the web)and packages it for marketers."
437670,irishfield,2010-02-27 01:44:00,26272, Gee.. now it's pointing to TJ's contests... Mod's can't enter!!
437674,xeon,2010-02-27 01:48:00,350,"http://www.humminbird.com/company/media/pr...se.aspx?id=1369  Same crap, no graphics."

The last Bell cellphone allowed in this household hadn't even been used for it's first call before it started getting spam texts."
437713,Guest gbfisher,2010-02-27 03:48:00,0,You shouldnt have bought a Humminbird
437715,irishfield,2010-02-27 03:49:00,26272, I didn't.. and wouldn't...
