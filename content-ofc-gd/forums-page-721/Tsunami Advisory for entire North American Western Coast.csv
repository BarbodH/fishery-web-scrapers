437879,jediangler,2010-02-27 21:20:00,1923,I have some family vacationing in New Zealand but luckily they are on NZ's west coast side facing Australia and shouldn't be affected by it too much.  Update:  We have made contact with our family in the area. They had registered with the Canadian consulate after arriving in NZ 3 weeks ago. The Canadian consulate contacted them via email to warn them of the coming tsunami. They have since moved inland to higher ground. They said that before they were contacted they had not heard anything about an incoming tsunami from local sources. The local NZ population is going about their Sunday business as usual with an apparent disregard for these events.
