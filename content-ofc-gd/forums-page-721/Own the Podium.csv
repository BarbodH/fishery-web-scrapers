437931,Twocoda,2010-02-28 00:02:00,4130,but we sure as hell own the top step so far....i wonder if its going to come down to the hockey game for the gold count...wouldnt that be awsome!!!!
437941,jonnybass,2010-02-28 00:22:00,346,"Canada is currently up 3 - 0 on Norway in the men's curling gold medal game.  If we hold on to win, we will tie for the most gold medals of any country in winter olympic history. (13 gold medals) That will tie Soviet Union who won 13 Gold medals in 1976 in Innsbruck, Austria and Norway with 13 gold in 2002, Salt Lake.  If we then win tomorrow in hockey, Canada will set the new record for most gold medals in a winter olypic games with 14 gold medals.  We have already shattered the record for most gold medals by a host nation previously 10 gold medals (US 2002 and Norway 1994)"
437954,Twocoda,2010-02-28 00:58:00,4130,Yanks won 4 man bobsleigh ...closing the gap ( as the drama continues)
437959,ADB,2010-02-28 01:20:00,444,"There are only 4 events left at this point...  1) Men's curling - gold medal game between Canada and Norway 2) Men's hockey - bronze medal game between Russia and Finland 3) Men's 50km cross country - no Canadians or Americans are realistic medal threats 4) Men's hockey - gold medal game between Canada and the US  Therefore, sitting two golds above Germany, and three above the US, we have already clinched first overall for golds."

437991,danbouck,2010-02-28 02:53:00,4380,We won in men's curling so that is 13
438003,Toronto_Angler,2010-02-28 03:53:00,698,I think we have done amazing at these games! Even when people were disappointed that we werent leading the medal count and started criticizing own the podium it was really unfair. Extra funding does not guarantee you will win. It only guarantees that we will have the best resources to develop our elite athletes and put them into contention which we did. If you could buy medals then it wouldn't be as much fun to watch lol.  GO CANADA!!!!!
438008,Cudz,2010-02-28 04:10:00,2652,"I think we have done awesome.  Not to rain on any parades, just want to remind people that there are several new events that were not included in the winter games (even as late as 2002).  An example would be the long track speed skating persuit.  It was introduced in 2006. In 1976 there were no aerials, moguls, skeleton, curling or snowboarding events to name a only a few.  Money is the key.  Go to the B2ten web site and see how their sponsored athletes have done during these Olympics.  They only have 20 that are in the winter olympics and of those 20 that are completely sponsored by private anonymous business people, 12 have sored medals and an amazing 7 are taking home Gold!!!  That is sick. B2ten is a nuts and they do it right!"
