437114,rfmcrx,2010-02-26 01:23:00,42,"hey I'm new to the site, I live in the haliburton highlands.i spend most of my summer fishing and wakeskating. I have a gas powered winch for wakeskating. i can ride pretty much anywere be it a stream,lake,pond, puddle,etc. I have been searching around for new spots in Southern ontario. I am looking for small weirs or dams that we can winch at. Just wondering if anybody knew of some good spots? here is a pic of my winch . "
437236,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-02-26 06:56:00,158,"Is that legal?  How much depth do you need?  Can't u use docks, wouldn't that be safer?"
437262,rfmcrx,2010-02-26 12:37:00,42,"Yes it is legal,I can ride in 3""s of water. What we look for in dams and weirs is some sort of drop that we can jump down, just like a skateboarder jumps dowm a set of stairs.http://www.vimeo.com/8970872 check that video out."
437264,Beats,2010-02-26 12:43:00,543,"When I read your post initially I had no idea what you were talking about.  While the idea of it kinda seems interesting, I highly doubt fisherman are gonna give directions to places where you could do this.  Just seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen."
437284,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-26 13:51:00,0,"due to the inherent danger in playing around low head dams, i doubt that it is ""legal"" or advisable to do this. hey look, it's you! "
437326,Musky or Specks,2010-02-26 15:01:00,2710,If people want to do it let them. I like to think of it as evolution in action. The less stupid gene in the human genome pool the better
437394,rfmcrx,2010-02-26 17:29:00,42,If its legal or not who cares. We are just out having fun and taking precautions as needed. Just thaught I'd ask and see what response i would get. Guess this is not the forum to ask for spots as most people probably dont want us there anyways. I'm not worried about drowning as we always wear lifejackets were there is currents and undertows.

437421,NAW,2010-02-26 18:28:00,4022,How long is the cable..?  And what's the max speed you can get up to..?  That looks pretty cool.
437436,bare foot wader,2010-02-26 18:59:00,1354,"prolly not the best forum to ask in but looks cool....  try the nith river, downtown new hamburg, about 15 mins west of kitchener....very light fishing pressure at best so probably a good spot for ya...dam there is about twice the vert of the dam in the vid you posted and can run dry in summer, but would prob work for ya in late spring and early summer"
437520,bigfish1965,2010-02-26 21:33:00,3382,Lots of wing dams on the Credit River...but if you can find a place 12 Mile Creek in St Catharines would be perfect..right along the 406 beside the place where they light that building on fire to train firemen...stupendous spot.
437523,ChrisK,2010-02-26 21:43:00,2772,I got a great spot for you guys...Fanshawe Dam in London On.  I think your going to have to add para gliding apparatus to your gear though....  Good Luck !!
437566,rfmcrx,2010-02-26 23:00:00,42,"Thanks guys for the info. The winch has a 6.5 hp briggs and stratton engine, with a centrifugal clutch off a go kart. The spool holds 1000ft of line and can pull me up to about 24-25 mph on water.I built the entire thing from scratch.  The Park in my town floods out every spring when the snow melts and we go winch there. last year the parking lot at the lcbo flooded out and we rode there too!"
437582,tb4me,2010-02-26 23:32:00,3295,Hey that does look cool! i wouldnt do it but i would watch!! The flood watrs around here last summer were nasty..I wouldnt want to go down in the fast water we get around here thou. even with a life jacket
