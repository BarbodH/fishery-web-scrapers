Is it just the usual handful of items or is it a sale in which everything is on sale?  I'm not interested in BPS-branded gear, looking more for sales in brand name items (Berkley, Strike King, Koppers, power pro, seaguar, etc)  Thanks in advance."
437987,BillM,2010-02-28 02:46:00,17367,"Everything, all at once, one day only, 75% off.  However, there is only ONE of each item, so get there quick!!!    Read the flyer, certain things are on sale on certain days."
437990,Bernie66,2010-02-28 02:51:00,123,"Go to their website and take a look at their America flyer for the sale.  It is on right now down there, ours doesn't start till the 12th of March."
