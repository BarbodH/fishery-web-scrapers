437528,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-26 21:45:00,4399,  Good Lord!!!Shakes head in disbelief.
437530,bigfish1965,2010-02-26 21:49:00,3382, Takes me less time to put someone on ModQ...wanna see?
437532,Rich Clemens,2010-02-26 21:57:00,3131,Sounds like a dream we'd all like to wake up to.   You catch more fish in one day than I catch all year.  Congrats on some fantastic days.
437551,Stoty,2010-02-26 22:27:00,2910,Pictures added.............
437552,splashhopper,2010-02-26 22:30:00,2931, where ?
437554,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-26 22:32:00,2690,"Nice, Jamie, but the ""whiners"" are going to say...how come you don't have 100 pictures, etc...blah, blah... Lets be done with the whole thing...you know what happened, everyone there knows what happened, anyone that knows you will believe it and those that don't aren't worth it.  My last two cents on this entire brutal thread.  Good fishing, buddy...hope to see you in May!!!"
437558,Grimace,2010-02-26 22:42:00,2020,"The discrepancy is between 62 and 108 fish.   Either way it is a lot of fish, but an explanation is more suitable than a few fish pictures.  The explanation so far is that the other guy left early, after 62 fish were caught and did the report at 10 at night without getting the final numbers for the day.  Even though he left half way through and had already tallied enough fish for the best day.  His interest wasn't peaked enough apparently to find the final numbers (47 more fish) before he advertised it on the web.  That does not make sense.   Stoty you still have not explained whether or not you stand by your comments that Jeff C and company photoshopped there fish.  He seemed to have proved he didn't with the camera data.  So after that accusation of your competition and the photo data proof being given you have said nothing.   So it is one or the other.  My point being that you have never had a problem calling people out.  The whole thing stinks."
437567,Handlebarz,2010-02-26 23:01:00,3790,Great looking fish for sure I wish our BOD meeting was out that way last week I would have been out there for sure but its a little to far from Peterbrough.  So which one is for our team?
437568,Stoty,2010-02-26 23:02:00,2910,"Yes, based on the picture I do stand by my comments. You failed to mention that 95% of people also thought it was Photoshopped. It wasn't a direct attack on my competition, it was a comment based on the picture that was taken. It didn't matter who caught the fish. We get along just fine with the Ice Fishing Team, lots of respect on both sides, but I'm sure you already knew that too. The picture is absolutely horrible quality, so yes IMO it appears Photoshopped. It's a great fish, which I also stated. Congrats to him on the fish.   And...again...YES we did get 108 fish. There was obviously a communication issue there. I didnt talk to him, so I don't know what happened.  Any other questions you would like answered?     BTW...your original post wasn't about either of those things, it was a personal flame directed towards me. Speaking of not replying....I sent you a PM, to which you must have overlooked as well.    Frankie said it best... the people who were out there know what happened, and the people who know us and how legit we are, also know what happened. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion."
437569,irishfield,2010-02-26 23:03:00,26272, LOL Mike ! You know you can't enter clients fish!!! Jamie has a good enough one for your team already... Just hope nobody protests the signage though..
437570,Stoty,2010-02-26 23:04:00,2910, Entered it last week dude!
437573,Stoty,2010-02-26 23:08:00,2910, Oh...knowing a few people on here....I'm sure they will! Look at how serious they take threads.....I can just image how they take the tournament! LOL

437290,canadadude,2010-02-26 14:00:00,769,"I agree with you bud, but this is not a good business practice when your running a guide service. It's one thing for the average dude to stretch a story a tad but misrepresenting your business is IMO shamefull. It's not only unfair to the clients it also is bad for the other area guides who tell the truth and run there business in an honest and truthfull maner."
437291,highdrifter,2010-02-26 14:00:00,2534,"Great!!  Wonderful!!  But, we're still waiting for a team name cap'm..  With all those lunkers you must have an entry doncha?!  HD"
437292,solopaddler,2010-02-26 14:02:00,8605,I had zero clue Stoty was guiding so his efforts to promote his service can't have been that obvious or spam-like.  Personally I'd allow him to provide some pic's and details before the thrashing ensues.
437293,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-26 14:03:00,2690,"Not going to say too much on this one...I know Jamie...he is legit, and, don't worry about pics he is a photography ""wiz""...NOBODY, takes better photos on BOQ.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion, as far as the competitions pics, and nothing against them...I'm sure they do an awesome job, however it seems that more than 50% of the photos they post are of themselves holding fish....hmmmmmmmmm."
437297,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-26 14:16:00,4399,"I don`t really care if the photo`s/report are legit what is getting a little tired is people/outfits like G2 and others promoting their services,lures etc. in a backdoor kinda way I mean come on you guys want people to pay you for your service but don`t want to pay for advertising.  If I owned this website I`d kick y`all to the curb.  Did I just say y`all? good lord I need to get out fishing soon."
437304,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-26 14:26:00,2690,"LOL, on the y'all...you do make a good point, though...maybe just the paying customers should post results...let the guide services do their posts on their blogs."

When it goes from good to bad in a matter of steps.......no amount of guiding experience is going to convince me to walk on that crap shoot."
437325,anders,2010-02-26 14:58:00,1168,"this could get fun....personally i dont care...just want to see some fish pics before i go fishing tomorrow.  Blaque...your absolutly right on the ice....crappy ice is crappy ice...when one spot is good today, it could be gone tomorrow, no expertise can prevent that"
437333,Stoty,2010-02-26 15:13:00,2910,"Wow!  Not once in my post did I say anythng about our guiding service. I posted a report.  Don't see how a report is spam when there are no plugs about a business.  Pictures are coming, don't you guys worry.  There were 8 guys total and yes we landed that many fish.  Most of you need to relax. I've been a loyal member of this site for a while now so give me some credit.  Yes I do work for G2 and yes we are guides but I don't spam like some of you are crying about.  If you guys have anything else to say please feel free and PM me.   Stoty"

437433,Stoty,2010-02-26 18:57:00,2910,"I guess I should have known that it would turn into this on OFC....  For those of you who acuse me of ""spamming"".....where in my post did it say anything about G2? For those of you who accuse me of being a Bull'er....Pictures will be up tonight.  For those of you who see my creditability and rep on this site, THANK YOU.  I just cant get over how a lot of threads on this site turn into flaming, it's unreal.  My partner who made that other post on the Quinte site, didnt hear the final numbers of the days before he made that post.  And for my ORIGINAL post....here's something to think about:  108 fish caught by 8 guys = 13 fish per person (avg) 90 fish caught by 8 guys = 11 fish per person (avg)  Is that so hard to believe that a person can catch 13 fish in a 10 hr fishing day??   For that dude who commented personally about me....  When I made the first post back in January about the ice conditions and where to fish etc...I wasnt part of G2, and didnt have much experience on the Bay. I then hooked up with G2, and joined their team. I spent the next 2 weeks learning everything these guys know. You'd be amazed how much you can learn in one day...let alone 2 weeks! So, yes it was a HUGE change for me, but since joining the team, I now know how to smoke the fish on the Bay.  I'm sure you wont believe that either...cause you dont see to believe much that I say...so all I have to say for everyone who thinks I'm full of it...wait for the pictures! They dont lie."
437439,archie_james_c,2010-02-26 19:05:00,618,  Screw the haters dude...keep landing big eye's..

437453,jonnybass,2010-02-26 19:35:00,346," It's pretty sad that people would accuse someone who has contributed as much you have to this board of spamming -  Certain ppl need to get off the high horse.  Stoty, don't worry about it."
437469,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-26 19:54:00,2690,"Nicely done, Jamie...don't sweat it...not worth the aggravation!!!!"
437477,GoneFishin,2010-02-26 20:12:00,349," He had a good idea taking people out ice fishing. If he told every one where to fish I'm pretty sure he wouldn't get any business lol... Hell if I had a ride up there and I knew where they were catching all these pickerel, my hut would be right up beside his.. well beside everyone else that decided to come out and leech off of his successes. With a little bit of work any of you guys could have been doing the same thing he is, give him a break! A lot of fishing forums have strict rules against posting locations and pictures with a back ground. There must be a reason for that, wouldn't you think?......... If you want to know where the fish are with out the leg work, you better start making friends outside of the board.. lol"
437498,Mykester,2010-02-26 20:53:00,241,"Those pictures from the other thread looked photoshopped. Hurry up OP, it doesn't take that long to photoshop 200 fish into a picture!"
437506,jonnybass,2010-02-26 20:59:00,346,   I guess they don't ban trolls here like they used to.
437508,Grimace,2010-02-26 21:08:00,2020,"So his post was in past tense.   ""Tuesday was even better, we had our best day on the ice EVER…62 walleye""  So he made this post after 10:06 at night and he never phoned you guys to see how the best day ever ended?  If he left after 62 walleye, and 108 were caught he must have left much earlier to give you guys time to catch 46 fish.  So if he left that early and it was apparently the best day ever I would think that he would be very interested in how things turned out.  Your pretty defensive for a guy who called his competition photo shoppers, and said it was by far the worst photoshopping job you have ever seen.  Quote As an advanced Photoshop user I totally agree that the fish is most definitely altered! Lighting is off, edges are absolutely brutal, the way he's holding it, etc.  It's very easy to alter a fish to appear MUCH larger than it actually is.  However...that is the WORST Photoshop job that I've ever seen, lol.  No doubt that is a nice fish, but it's nowhere near the quoted weight/size.  _________________ Jamie Stothart G2 Angling Specialists ""A Premium Guide Service"" 647-482-FISH www.G2Angling.com  End Quote  So I guess you call people out as well Stoty.   Your competition to boot.  As it turned out that picture wasn't Photoshopped and not a word from you.  I have no affiliation with your competition, I could care less.   But as far as you getting people to feel sorry for you because you got called out.  Gimme a Break.  Are you going to show pictures of 100 fish.   Really.  What does it prove?  That your group has in fact caught 100 fish.   When were they caught."
437152,Stoty,2010-02-26 02:29:00,2910,"WOW, WOW, WOW is all I can say about the Bay of Quinte the past 3 days! Tuesday we got 108 fish, with plenty over 10 lbs, and yesterday we got 90 fish.  The spot we have found is unreal! The numbers as well as the quality are incredible! We had 25 fish over 10 lbs in total, and tons of 5-9 lbs. The rest were in the 2-4 lb range which are perfect eating size. NO snot rockets at all, which is insane!  WARNING though.....the ice is getting pretty bad out there. Unless you know what you're doing or go with a guide, I HIGHLY recommend staying off it. Some spots have great ice, while 10 ft away there's hardly any! There's tons of open water out there now.  Always put safety first!   Here are some pictures of the good fish!                            "
437154,JEREMY,2010-02-26 02:32:00,300,Good job i hope they are still around may 1st
437159,Dozer,2010-02-26 02:43:00,896,198 fish... over exagerating the numbers here I see  All I can say is... epic!
437173,timmeh,2010-02-26 03:00:00,609,WOW is right man. Spots that can deliver quality and quantity like that are what makes fishing so great. Hopefully the ice holds and you can get back out again.  It continues to amaze me how the BOQ continues to produce such fish with all the pressure.
437176,Stoty,2010-02-26 03:04:00,2910," Very true, but the pressure is SO much less in the winter than the softwater season. THen again it helps having hundreds of thousands of fish cruising through as well! lol  It's sad that the Ice season comes to an end Sunday...what am I going to do until May?!"
437178,Leecher,2010-02-26 03:10:00,7832," You mind as well come up North in the Gatineau Valley and join me for some BO(Q)uebec walleyes    We got 20"" of solid ice up here Sounds like fun.... looking forward to seeing the pics!!! Leechman"

Sorry but for me and I only speak for mysef the other guides that know what i'm talking about can post what they want. This is 100% spam. 100% self promoting of a service. quinte post readsWell just 1 full week to go and the 2010 Walleye Hardwater season will be over….  We have been out for the last 4 days and are still out for the next 6 days. WALLEYE, WALLEYE, WALLEYE… The fishing has been great for numbers of Walleye, with our group averaging 25 to 30 Walleye a day. Sat & Sun we’re mostly smaller walleye, with 3 10lbers and an 11ber (Andrew Moore), but still lots of 5 to 7lbers.  Monday was a different story, with 30 Walleye being caught. We hit 8 Walleye over 10lbs and a 13lber…great day with extremely happy clients…  Tuesday was even better, we had our best day on the ice EVER…62 walleye (5 clients, NO KIDDING)….multiple 10+lbers….the Walleye were seriously on “FIRE”!! The interesting thing was, by moving a short distance and slightly deeper on our contour, we managed to intercept the walleye and really stay in their zone.  Erin Mclean and his gang of Trophy Hunters are over visiting from Michigan are in search of a Monster Walleye, they have hit many 10+, but not that elusive Trophy yet, we still have a few days to go, we’ll keep you all posted.  With the season winding down, we do have a few openings for Fri/Sat/Sun, but they will fill up quickly, call us if you want to jump into this action for the last time this year.
