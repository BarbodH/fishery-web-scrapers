The reasons are simple...it is too cumbersome and takes up too much disc space that we need for our database and uploaded images. So if you have pics there that you cannot lose, copy them and move them to the new gallery site. This site is on a seperate server to save resources for the board. The blog license is also not being renewed, but anyone seriously interested in blogging can let me know and we can help you out. The new board will have some trimming done and some new additions. There will be a fully integrated chat system that is tied to the log in so you just click and go on in. We are looking at doing hosted chats with some people you likely want to talk to. We couldn't do that before, but we thought it would be worth the money to purchase some solid chat software. There are things being done to allow for site expansion and better organization. It will be a bumpy ride at first as we get used to the advanced 'behind the scenes' stuff so bear (or bare) with us while we get it done. the site will be down during the database portion of the upgrade but that will be less than 24 hours. We are just awaiting a few new modules that I ordered today and we are good to go."
