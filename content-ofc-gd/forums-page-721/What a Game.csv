437720,bigugli,2010-02-27 04:03:00,6138,what a great game. One more period and we hit the final.  Slovaks aren't beat yet. Still a tight game.
437729,danbouck,2010-02-27 04:42:00,4380,I almost had a heart attack!
437730,Dusky,2010-02-27 04:44:00,310,Man I am glad it's over..... now bring on the yanks!!
437731,TJQ,2010-02-27 04:50:00,7806,I dont know how we stopped them from tieing.. man that was pure luck for Canada.. totally outplayed.. the hockey gods were with us tonight...  I was super impressed with the slovacs....  ill be rooting for them tomorrow nite.   and then bring on the GOLD!!
437732,irishfield,2010-02-27 04:52:00,26272,Yep.. if Canada didn't have a goalie.. they'd be playing for Bronze for sure. Boys got to cocky for their own good..
437734,BillM,2010-02-27 05:02:00,17367,"Man, we SUCKED tonight...  Time to play all 3 periods boys...  If you show up against the US like you did tonight against the Slovaks, kiss your gold medal goodbye..."
437735,Handlebarz,2010-02-27 05:08:00,3790,"I think I lost 2"" off each finger during the last 8min.   What about the speed skaters WOW what a great night for them that sure was some fun to watch to bad for the girls curling."
437752,Rich Clemens,2010-02-27 12:22:00,3131,Congrats to you team.   Sunday's GOLD MEDAL game should be a great one.   Looking forward to it.
437762,solopaddler,2010-02-27 13:10:00,8605, I agree.  But they'll be jacked for Sundays game I'm not too worried.
437775,canadadude,2010-02-27 13:47:00,769,"What happened in the last 8min they fell asleep, and gave Slovakia an extra forward named Patrice Bergeron, he's freaking brutal. Please Babcock keep Patrice on the bench, team Canada is having a hard enough time with these other teams no need to give the oponent another player."
437814,Billy Bob,2010-02-27 16:42:00,5865, Watch what you wish for........you could get.........MILLERIZED....
437848,BillM,2010-02-27 19:15:00,17367," There was a lot more going wrong in the previous game then just Miller.  If we come out against the US tomorrow like we did Russia, your poor boys are going to be shell shocked  Physical forwards, win the battle on the boards and own the neutral zone.  If we do this, our gold medal count goes up by one."
