Three large show rooms for the boats, and one large jam packed show room for fishing. There are a number of retail vendors who came down from Toronto, plus those in SW Ontario, plus Angling Outfitters have taken over an entire wall. If you live in the area and are only going to one show, don't bother with Toronto."
