437062,Daplumma,2010-02-25 23:23:00,1961,I believe Roy has a few lures to show also.Peter makes some sweet bucktails too. Joe
437064,irishfield,2010-02-25 23:31:00,26272,Here's some of Roy's 2007 beauties floating in Thorpe's sink! I had a muskie on the green pokadot one..  
437073,bigugli,2010-02-25 23:47:00,6138,"Thanks for the plug Cliff.  I tie bucktail harnesses, jigs and streamers. Have a lot of fun with them, both in the making and the fishing with them.        Sorry they aren't laid out nicer, but I'm in the middle of packing to move next week."
437078,Leecher,2010-02-26 00:00:00,7832, Thanks Peter!!!      Lots of fun to make and more challenging as I add new pattern to my collection..... I've got lots of testing to do come spring
437274,Roy,2010-02-26 13:27:00,13728,"I haven't total permission to post these but our Bud Marc Thorpe makes his own baits for his muskie season. He goes though a lot of baits in one season...24-36 spinnerbaits alone and honestly, I've fished with him a few times and I can't remember him using a spinnerbait but I know he uses them. Here is few pics of his 2010 crop of spinnerbaits. He always says ""They ain't pretty, they're built to catch"". I don't think he sells any though.      I think they're pretty nice....  Oops, and here's another..  "

Cliff Your application did get to the final 3 though I need to make a decision soon but solopaddler did say "" please don't disown me I will be good and pay you a thousand dollars a month and name my next born Art"" well actually what he really said was ""   "" but I know what he meant.  If Pete and Roy don't step up to the plate soon I am going to post a few pictures of their fine examples of Baits for them. I hope they will share I really like the look of them.   Art"

437550,Big Cliff,2010-02-26 22:23:00,6899,"Well Bruce, I guess I'm just going to have to make another trip down your way once you get moved into your new digs. I can see a couple there I'd like to add to my collection and I've got a new design for you that I stumbled on by accident one day when I had to scramble because I lost my last store bought one. I did what any good fisherman/woman would do, I improvised and put 11 walleye in the boat while the other two guys only landed 3 between them.   They have never invited me to fish with them again but they still talk about that day LOL."
437838,Spiel,2010-02-27 18:06:00,9065," Thanks Peter.     I agree, drop in more often Peter.    I hope to score one of them fancy Roy baits, soon. They are sweet!    They all look killer to me Bruce. Nice work.     So you have semi permission Roy....LOL Nice looking spinner baits Marc."
437854,brickNblock,2010-02-27 19:46:00,598,"Art, Chris, thanks both for the kind words.  I do pop in now and then to browse whats up, sure is alot of new faces. This is one of the better threads I've seen in a while Art, many should be enlightened by the membership that actually make their own baits and the pleasant surprise of the quality by all...maybe it'll produce a whole new generation of bait makers.  It isnt about money..it is a love in many forms..Anyone who's lucky enough to have a one of a kind are forunate.  I know Roy makes exellent baits, and have heard nothing but great things about Joey's extreme In-Lines.  As for mine, like Lew, they're all strung across the big livewell, the only use for it on my boat, and thats in winter storage, I'll post some pic's soon when I go to visit 'er for some spring cleaning..I think this thread will be around for a while, else I'll dig it up...I'll be making new in about a month or so, something completely different.  ...and post them to this thread.  MarcThorpe..not surprised at all, I'd be more surprised if he didnt make all his own baits, most all the decent guides and pro's do, what a collection just the same.  I'll PM you about LakAir plans... Be well lads. pete"
437856,brickNblock,2010-02-27 19:56:00,598,"....only regret Ive ever experienced from these fines lures....  Lent some to a buddy for a trip north for musky,who lent some to his friend whilst there who never returned the 'FireTiger', you made me......  ...  ....  ...so the story went.  The lure was replaced with a store bought facimile but, But a bait hand crafted from a friend can never be replaced, it has history and memories....unfortunate but wont happen again."

These fine examples of craftsmanship are way too cool to actually use and risk loosing to some 16"" Northern snot rocket! LOL  I would prefer to keep them safe to enjoy looking at such as Leechman and Roy have done!  Nice looking work there everyone! The attention to detail is amazing! Great thread idea Art."
436527,Spiel,2010-02-24 15:51:00,9065," Thanks Michael, very kind.  Don't stall to long on fulfilling that bucket list. Fly Fishing is exciting and yet also frustrating at times but don't let that deter you."
436566,BillM,2010-02-24 17:28:00,17367,"Chris, any suggestions on what the Grey/Bruce brookies and brownies like?   I'll be putting in a lot of time on that water this year (I hope)"
436576,Great Lake Steel,2010-02-24 17:44:00,41," It's something I'm planning on doing this summer.  In regards to those terrific patterns you posted, are you selling any? Do have other picture of flies you've tied.  I'm starting to suspect that I'm actually a fly fisherman at heart (do use them with the centerpin though)."
436580,NAC,2010-02-24 18:13:00,369," for pike; in perch, yellow/red and black/orange patterns if possible."
436595,Spiel,2010-02-24 18:50:00,9065," While I've never fished the creeks up that way for Brookies and Browns Bill I'm sure you can't go wrong with Stoneflies, Caddis nymphs and Mayfly nymphs. One of my faves for small creeks is actually nothing more than red squirrel hair tied on a small lead head jig hook. It easily probes into log jams and undercut banks far more effectively than tradional flies. It can represent anything from caddis larva, minnow fry and even small crayfish.    I've only recently gotten back into fly tying and have a few threads showing some pictures. You can see them here.....  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...c=40140&hl=  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...c=39716&hl=  And yes the flies I've been tying lately are bead heads tied on jig hooks specifically for use with the float rod.  But I'm sorry to say at this time I'm not selling any, I'm now busy building rods and truth is they pay better."
436627,Twocoda,2010-02-24 20:13:00,4130, think along the lines of  purple ...or green maribou with crystal flash
436653,aplumma,2010-02-24 21:28:00,6896,Here is a lure I made a little bit ago but haven't water tested it. It might just spin in circles if so it will go back on the console of the big boat.  
436662,solopaddler,2010-02-24 22:44:00,8605,  What? That's nothing more than a Mann's Little George with different eyes!   
436672,Joey,2010-02-24 23:02:00,9122," Yup, I do spinner and inlines in any colour you like.  Let me know how many if you are interested.  Joey"
436674,cheaptackle,2010-02-24 23:10:00,849,   Good thing you're joking!  Al - I can only say it's a humdinger!  Looks like it just came out of a high priced package.  Michael
436696,aplumma,2010-02-24 23:56:00,6896,  you mean you saw thru the eye switch ? and I thought I was sooooooo clever.    Art
436699,solopaddler,2010-02-25 00:02:00,8605," Yep I saw right through it, you're a hack!"
436707,aplumma,2010-02-25 00:11:00,6896,  Does this mean we arn't brothers any more?  That makes me alittle sad. I guess I will be accepting applications for a new brother/ sister since I am an equal opportunity family.   Art

436859,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-02-25 12:49:00,158,"Spiel those stonefly immitations are insane, I have seen a lot fo the real thing and those are just incredible.  What in the heck did you use for the legs? Do you sell these things?  I would drift these suckers under a float for sure.  And about the suick copy.  Nice job man.  It is one of the most copied muskie baits and for good reason, they work.  How hard is your finish? sounds like it would stand up better than what is on the real deal. Gotta love sustom one off colours too.  I woudl also liek to add. What if it was just a repainted suick, but it was some kid you did it and was really proud of it... Nice....Use your head.  And there is something to be said for custom paint jobs.  Some muskie lures work so well (suick is a perfect example) the paint gets chewed right off of them and it takes talent to repaint them properly and effectively.  Custom painted muskie baits I have seen recently like nimmer swimmers, harbour masters and hose baist can go from anywhere from $50 to $150.  I don't have the talent or the paitence to create these babies like you do, keep up the good work."
436874,Spiel,2010-02-25 13:41:00,9065," Thank you.  I constucted the legs from Swiss Straw, first tearing it into thin strips then knotting each one and then dipping them into fly head cement. Tedious to say the least.  Sorry I'm not currently selling any but perhaps in the future when time allows me to make them.  I can promise you though that they'll be under my float this spring."
436950,brickNblock,2010-02-25 18:02:00,598,"I am also an owner of Art's lures.  The JAILBIRD has been an exellent bait, really enjoyed it Bud!

One guy that hasn't posted is bigugli. I know he makes a lot of jigs and I'd realy like to see some of them posted.  How about it Bruce, care to post a few? I'm going to need some new jigs for this summer and if anyone makes something similar to a reef runner I'd be very interested. Fire tiger pattern deep diver. Really glad you started this thread Art, I have some beautiful buck tails, harnises, and jigs that were made for me by friends from this board.  I cherish each and every one of them but I must confess that most of them have not caught fish for me. (I guess if I ever put them in the water they might have a chance but I am too afraid I might loose one of them).  Oh and Art, if you are accepting applications for a new brother; that $100.00 bill I've stapeled to mine wasn't meant as a bribe or anything"

436150,aplumma,2010-02-23 19:58:00,6896,Bondar and Kinger those are some nice jigs... I haven't been able to tie a good jighead it seems the hair is always lop sided. The tinsel stinger is a great idea Kinger I see that as a great crappie/perch trigger.   I think I will stick with wood and metal those are a median I have faith in.   I wish I lived close enough to visit Gbfisher and Leechman for a round of crafting.    So what have you been up to Chris??? got any new flies tied or are you able to get back to your other threadwork? He doesn't want anyone to know but.....(he sews the cotton crotches into pantyhoses for a little extra money).     Art

Do you own the Suick factory and perhaps feel a little slighted?  I fail, no matter how hard I try, to find anything of value to others in your comment.  Care to enlighten those of us who are perhaps missing your valuable point?

436166,Twocoda,2010-02-23 20:42:00,4130,yep winter has reared it ugly head again ...lol...  the comment about sewing the panties reminds me of the first time i made love....every push forward her legs would fly up in the air....couldnt understand why until i realized she had forgotten to take  her nylons off  yes that comment was made on purpose in hopefully a successful attempt to lighten this thread up and get back to the original great topic for a thread  Im doing my homework right now on which lathe to buy cuz i want to start turning my own plugs for rigging
436175,Kinger,2010-02-23 20:56:00,351,Some real creative guys on here!!
436198,xeon,2010-02-23 21:37:00,350," Well, I thought his lure was a suick, I really did. I expressed my opinions on his lure looking like a suick with the eyes painted over, mainly because the lure looks like, and is based off of a suick and it has no eyes, and in the picture it looks like there were eyes, but later painted over. Therefore, not really making it homemade just a fancy paint job which was the reason why I commented in the first place. So he called me a jackass for pointing that out, and if he thinks I'm a jackass I'll talk to him like one."

436469,cheaptackle,2010-02-24 13:32:00,849,Spiel - I have never seen a more realistic bait in my life - those are almost too beautiful to actually use!  Not yet a fly fisherman (it's on my bucket list) but I think I'd spend more time admiring those than using them if I had them.  Michael

435689,aplumma,2010-02-22 20:06:00,6896,The premise of this if you are a seller:  If you have a lure/lures that you have made and wish to sell them/show them off then post a picture and a price for the lure. When it sells then edit it as sold.   If you are a buyer   then send a P.M. or an E mail to the poster and exchange information as to the sale.  READ ME :  This is not designed for mass produced or volume sales. If you do have that  in mind Please contact T.J. or one of the Mods for advertisment rates. You will get the respect of the Board members as a stand up guy and your sales will be greater.   This does not have anything to do with the website and is not being policed by anyone. If you do decide to sell/ barter/trade it is between you and the other member make sure that the payment and the shipping of the merchandise is carried out and that you pay for the item. If this works then we might be able to get a section dedicated to this thread. If a transaction falls thru it is buyer beware the MODS and OWNER will not respond to any complaints. SO please everyone do what is correct and hopefully we will have some nice friendships develop and some one of a kind lures.   Art

435698,aplumma,2010-02-22 20:33:00,6896,no.... no.. hidden motive or requests from friends/etc.  I am actually looking for the garage hobbyist who made them in the ice season. I have seen a few talented makers and have collected lures from them over the years. If someone is mass producing or expects to have volume sales then yup they need to advertise for sure. I Know some of the best lures I have used came to me as gifts and I have always returned the gift with one that makes them as happy as they made me.  BTW if you have a lure that you wish to sell because you are proud of it I might be able to find it a good home I am sure T.J. won't blackball us.   Art
435701,Roy,2010-02-22 20:43:00,13728,"I think we pretty well know who the production guys are. It could be an interesting thread. Whether anyone buys or not, we could at least drool over someone's talent. If there are to be any transactions, it would be preferable that they be carried out by personal message or email."

435707,Spiel,2010-02-22 21:16:00,9065,"I have a good friend on the board that made this musky bait for me....      I used on my first musky venture to Eagle Lake a few years back and was determined to get a fish on it which would have been my first musky. While it did produce the only fish for the 4 days a friend and I worked the lake, alas it was not a musky but rather a pike. None the less I was happy it caught a fish! I'll also state that it did raise several musky that seemed very interested in the colour pattern, the only other single lure to garner as much interest was a black suick.  It's solidly built and if he wants to take credit for it, he can."
435737,aplumma,2010-02-22 22:19:00,6896, I will fess up it was one of the first group of lures I made Chris. I have a new one for you and will bring it up to Lak Air for you.   Art
435767,Spiel,2010-02-22 22:50:00,9065, I'll be happy to take it Art and even happier if it gets me my first musky. I promise to give it a good workout while I'm there.

435999,aplumma,2010-02-23 13:36:00,6896,"  Yup you caught me their little XERON I can't pull the wool over your eyes their. Jackass  Now if you knew me you would never have made that statement. If you had held the lure in your hands you would have see were I had started off with a piece of red cedar in block form and then whittled it into the likeness of a suick. You would have seen the 3 base coats of white then a coat of green with glitter then a transparent blue layered over the top. The tailfin was cut out by hand and mounted with screws. I think I have around 6 fun filled hours into that ""repainted suick"". I can not put a price on that lure because the only people that will get one of them are my best friends. Something you will never have to worry about.   Art"
436002,Guest gbfisher,2010-02-23 13:54:00,0,  Another paint job for sure................
436003,Raf,2010-02-23 13:57:00,3495,at least 'they' didnt paint over the eyes.
436004,Roy,2010-02-23 14:00:00,13728,I can assure you it's not a suick. I feel blessed having one of Art's baits.

436075,xeon,2010-02-23 16:43:00,350," So then it is basically a copied suick like I said... but, it doesn't have eyes and looks like they were painted over.  Don't worry about giving me one because I'm not your ""friend"", I can buy one and peel the eyes off myself."
436076,Bondar,2010-02-23 16:44:00,817,I took advice from some people on here earlier in the year and started making my own rabbit fur jigs and marabou jigs !now these arent no 6 hour hand carved pieces work but they do catch fish LOL     
436077,Roy,2010-02-23 16:47:00,13728,"Very nice, clean work, Bondar! Great colours too!"
436078,Terry,2010-02-23 16:48:00,14456,"dang, there are lots of talented people on this board"
436079,Harrison,2010-02-23 16:52:00,2202," Great work bud, for me the one above is MINT... love the colouring, nice natural shillouette."
