438135,Sandbag,2010-02-28 17:18:00,533,Nice fish...looks like a beautiful day...  Nice RMK too by the way.....  Cheers  Craig
438147,camillj,2010-02-28 17:32:00,1988,Thanks for sharing... Looks like a good day to me ! ... and btw ... maybe woulda been a little faster WITH a little meat on the hook (did you try)... either way great job ! Me... I like the pink flesh of specks over lakers any day (but that may be because I really have to work extra hard to get to specks from where I live)
438239,pike slayer,2010-02-28 20:33:00,1177,"haha your on your own slowpoke! jk ya its some great scenery, only way into the lake is snowmobile or 4wheeler. thanks sandbag, i plan on selling it this spring and upgrading. and bait affects the action of the lure. the other 2 guys we were with (one being eazy) was using meat on the hooks and they only got one. ive never seen a fish caught on this lake with a still line cause for one reason theres no live bait. i dont even bother putting out a still line, just drill a bunch of holes and move hole to hole. i find small inland lake lakers taste better then specks but thats just me. i also love eating pike haha!"
438245,smitter,2010-02-28 20:52:00,106,"Good job worm dangler, I think the fishing is slow everywhere up here right now. We went out for whities today, saw tons on the camera, but couldn't buy a strike.  BTW I'm with you, lakers taste better than specks."
438249,Fishing 24/7,2010-02-28 20:57:00,709,sweet no slush in your erea thats nice !  nice lakers man! cong
438260,pike slayer,2010-02-28 21:07:00,1177,"ya i was just like geez if its this slow on this lake then i wouldnt want to be on any other lake cause i'd be getting nothing at all and nope, no slush yet but its no worries the rmk can power through it with ease"
