I currenlty have an older vest that is just fine but I am tired of swapping my fly and float gear constantly.  Therefore I want a new vest for fly fishing purposes.  I have looked at the Simms G3 guiding vest.  It seems nice but it doesnt seem to fit very well and really is over the top expensive.  So, I guess what I am looking for is any reviews you have on your vest or chest pack for fly gear.  It may help me make my decision.  My choice is not financially restricted really, I just want something GOOD quality that will last a long time.  Thanks!"
