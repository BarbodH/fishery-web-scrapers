437042,TJQ,2010-02-25 22:49:00,7806,Had time to redo this one today.  
437044,danbouck,2010-02-25 23:02:00,4380,Sweet vid!
437303,TJQ,2010-02-26 14:25:00,7806,Thanks Dan.. I can't wait for summer.. I think Im gonna do alot more of these...
437316,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-26 14:47:00,3761,"Nice job, was really cool to see the musky come up to the bait several times. Tanks for putting this one up."
437324,Joey,2010-02-26 14:56:00,9122,So they really are just following my lures when I troll  Great vid TJ.  Joey
437328,Leecher,2010-02-26 15:04:00,7832,Good job on the vid TJ Makes you wonder what could you of done differently to get this brute to attack your offerings Thanks for sharing Leechman
437363,cram,2010-02-26 16:05:00,1733,Very cool video.   Are you dragging a downrigger ball?  What is the camera attached to?  Also - what is the tail on your spinner?
437424,TJQ,2010-02-26 18:31:00,7806,"To be honest, I really don't want to tell ya how the camera is rigged.. it took me a while to get it figured out to get the fish in close enough.. as for the lure.. its a walleye spinner with a sucker minnow trailing about 6 inches behind it.  Fish cant resist..."
437575,yakpiker,2010-02-26 23:14:00,160,"I've used that that set up...works great for pike...call it golden boy.  The video reminded me of fishing Restoule...the muskeys are there and you'll see the occasional follower, but so far they haven't bitten what I have to offer."
437745,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-02-27 08:34:00,158,"I know a guy who is really good at this.  In fact he was featured on IN'Fishermen and has been written about in their mag as well for this exact thing.  he uses an aquaview camera attached to a downrigger ball.  The bait is only like 10 feet behind that.  In his vid, he uses a sucker rig as well as a custom made spinnerbait (you can buy the retail version now called the train wreck) and also he uses 10 inch jakes.  he said the key to getting these fish to strike is to impart erractic action, by speeding up or turing or bashing the cannon ball and lure through structure.  his film is called ""Muskies Live"" and his Name is DOn Schartz.  His company is called Hog Head Lures.  Look him or his stuff stuff, he has vids on youtube as well .  if you are into this kinda thing, this guy is a master and his DVD breaks this down so anyone can do it, super cool.  He is a friend of mine, so naturally I am biased."
437749,Fishing 24/7,2010-02-27 11:16:00,709,by seeing this video.  i know realise that musky look UP for there food.  thanks.
