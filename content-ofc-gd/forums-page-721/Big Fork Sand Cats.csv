437643,cram,2010-02-27 01:02:00,1733, I personally like my Bobbie Baits way more than my suicks.
437645,irishfield,2010-02-27 01:03:00,26272,I like my Mr T's more than Suicks..
437652,cram,2010-02-27 01:17:00,1733, what is a Mr T?
437653,irishfield,2010-02-27 01:22:00,26272,I'll find a picture... Stacey was selling them a few years back.  Top right two are Mr T's..    I have a better picture somewhere of a big smallie that nailed the thing and the bait in the picture clearly. I'll find it.
437671,cram,2010-02-27 01:44:00,1733,"I'll keep an eye out for them.   How do they compare to a bobbie or suick? (the only two jerks i've used).  Love the look of that glider, btw.   If its action matches its looks it must be a hell of a bait."
437673,irishfield,2010-02-27 01:47:00,26272,That's a Hughes River Glider. Price not for the faint of hear.. but it works very nice. Haven't used it too much though.. nor caught anything on it! lol  Here's a better pic of that Mr. T in Perch pattern..
437675,xeon,2010-02-27 01:50:00,350,Thats just a suick with a different eye position.
437677,cram,2010-02-27 01:52:00,1733, That's an ambitious smallmouth :-).  Just looked up the hughes glider.  Ouch. I'm too poor for one of those. For the price i'll stick to hellhounds and mantas.   Sure looks nice though.
437678,irishfield,2010-02-27 01:52:00,26272,Lets not do that to this thread as well xeon... doesn't even have the same body shape as a suick.
437679,Andy,2010-02-27 01:54:00,330,"Thx for the suggestions. I like the look of the Mr T's. I checked them out on Pro Tackle site. Says the deep ones run down to 8'.  How deep do the regular versions run? And three sizes......8, 10, 12 ""....decisions, decisions....."
