204801,motv8tr,2008-05-22 15:18:00,2587,"Hey all, I picked up a new Rod from Mark Kulik a couple of weeks ago and now I need a new Reel for it.  It's a St. Croix 7' one piece,  Med-Lite, fast action and good for 1/8 to 1/2 oz lures and 4-10lb fish (good luck to me catching one that big  )  What is this best suited for and what Reel would you recommend?  I'm going to Bass Pro tomorrow....  Thanks Maureen"
204826,Garry2Rs,2008-05-22 16:01:00,1425,"The 4 to 10 lbs. is the line weight... If you're comfortable with the price it's hard to beat a Shimano Stradic.  I have the Stradic 1000 size reel on a rod like yours, but most people use the larger 2500 model.  The Canadian Shimano headquarters is just down the road from me, so I tend to stick with their products for ease of service etc. but there are many other reels out there, just choose one you like. Garry2R's"
204833,limeyangler,2008-05-22 16:11:00,5204,"I'm with Garry2r, I love Shimano...lots of different size reels for the same models to suit your needs and easy to get extra spools. Stradic is a good reel, but coming from Europe i like the rear drag with fighting drag features that they have over there....take a look here under  rear drag reels. I have my heart set on the GTM RB 2500, pricey will be around $C200 with postage but an awesome reel!"
204841,crappieperchhunter,2008-05-22 16:17:00,2582,"Maureen I have owned them all. From higher end expensive toys to low end stuff that only lasts 3-4 seasons of hard use. Personally I have found Diawa reels to last me the best.  Dollar for dollar I think they make the best product. I used to get the higher priced stuff but found that it makes more sense for me to grab a $60-$80 ballpark priced reel and then just replace it every 7 years or so when I feel like treating myself to a new reel.  As a matter of fact my latest Diawa was a $44 reel I picked up in Gagnon's in April. Spooled it up with 4LB line and did all my spring crappie and perch fishing with it. Really like it so far, but I have only had it for about 6 weeks so I can't say how it will stand up. It's up at the cottage right now or I would give you the model number. Good luck choosing a new reel Maureen....lotsa stuff to drool over before you decide.  Have fun with your new combo once you get it out on the water."
204880,muskymike,2008-05-22 17:43:00,772,"Casting or Spinning? Stradic you can not go wrong with for Spinning. For casting, well thats a whole different story. I have a Chronarc Mg and I love it but its very expensive. Have a look around and hopefully you can get some more input with the guys that buy them more frequently on OFC."
204883,Victor,2008-05-22 17:51:00,1609,Do you have a budget? It would narrow it down a bit ...
204898,motv8tr,2008-05-22 18:45:00,2587,"Thanks for the suggestions folks, I appreciate it.  I'm not sure if it's for spinning or bait casters?  I tried to look at my other rods but who knows, I'm thinking it's a spinning reel I'm looking for  As for budget, less is best right now, but I don't want to go so cheap that it won't last me a season.  Also anyone know what type of fishing this type of rod is best used for?  Thanks again Maureen"
204905,bigbuck,2008-05-22 18:57:00,2449,Shimano Sahara for under a hundred bucks would be a good choice. A comparable Daiwa or Quantum reel in the same price range would also be good choices. 2500 size would be perfect spooled with 6lb test.
204910,BillM,2008-05-22 19:01:00,17367,1 piece rod?  I would guess it's a baitcaster.
204955,aplumma,2008-05-22 20:20:00,6896,Hey maureen does the eyelets on the rod start off at the base bigger than a quarter and get smaller as they go to the tip or are they start off small size of a dime and stay about the same size to the tip? If you can wait for Lak Air I have a few reels laying around that you can have that will fit it depending on what type of reel it needs.  Art
204968,mikeh,2008-05-22 20:46:00,824,"I'd recommend you take the model number with you and if basspro has one you can put some reels on it to see how it feels . I'd personally go with a 1000 or 1500 series reel since it is a light rod , or if it is a baitcast rod I'd go with a 100 series reel."
205021,motv8tr,2008-05-22 22:53:00,2587," Hey Art, the eye's start bigger than a quarter and get smaller as they go up to the tip, I'm guessing that's for a spinning reel based on my other rods and reels?  Maureen"
205036,JustinHoffman,2008-05-22 23:17:00,482,"Hi Maureen,  Yep, it would be a spinning rod. Easiest way to tell the two apart in the future is by whether or not it has a trigger grip. All baitcast rods do. The trigger is just under half an inch long and shaped similar to a curved and pointed finger. It is located at the reel seat, and is placed between your own fingers when wrapped around a rod for fishing.)  Baitcast Rod (showing trigger grip)    Spinning Rod (no trigger grip present)    As for the type of fishing it is best for, I would say walleye and bass. Will work well for light jigging and tossing small cranks and spinners. Bit light for working any heavy cover. Would also make a decent panfish rod if an ultralight model isn't at your disposal.  In terms of reels, like other have said, there are many to choose from. I just picked up a bunch of Quantum ""Incyte"" reels this spring. Really impressed with them. Go with the model ""20"" for the rod you have. They retail for about $50 U.S. Another great reel is the Bass Pro Shops ""Extreme"". I've owned a few of these in the past, and they are extremely smooth, great drags, and comparable to many higher-end reels. They also retail for about $50 U.S. There are three sizes - go with the middle one to match up with your rod.  Happy Shopping,  Justin"
205225,Sinker,2008-05-23 04:30:00,8692,"I have a similar shimano clarus that I run a diawa laguna on. Its been a great reel so far. Should cost around $100 or so. Its in the hardbody series, so has an all metal body. Its been working good for 3 or 4 seasons now, and I also use it for icefishing as well. Very smooth, and a great drag.  Sinker"
205229,Greencoachdog,2008-05-23 05:16:00,8163,"That rod would be best suited for casting for Bass and Wall-ice, but could be used for panfish as well. It's a little light for Pike in my opinion, but you may get a few with it.  As for the reel, I'd go with something like this in the SY2500FI model: http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...0001000_100-1-2  Not to terribly expensive and should last a few seasons.  I'd spool it up with some 8 lb. mono."
205230,Sinker,2008-05-23 05:28:00,8692," Yup, I have one of those too. The only thing I don't like about it is the plastic on the bail arm.....where the roller is. I find the line cuts a groove in the plastic...then it will always run thru that groove.....fraying your line.  Other than that, its a great reel.  I caught one in rice lake one time......with a rod attached, and line.....which had a crappie on the end....LOL. Still works to this day.  Sinker"
205332,brooks999,2008-05-23 15:26:00,38,"I cannot believe no one has said this.....  Look at the Pflueger President, approx $60 at BPS....the have a compbo special on now with an X-Treme Rod mated with the Pflueger President for $99.99  Consider the rod a great back up to your St.Croix"
205418,motv8tr,2008-05-23 19:14:00,2587,"Thanks for all the replies, I picked up a Daiwa Regal 2500xia.  It was 45.00 so I'm happy, had one spooled with 6lb and the other with 8lb trilene....  Maureen"
