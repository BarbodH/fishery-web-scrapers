205140,Nanook,2008-05-23 01:47:00,565,"Will do Rick.............can't miss that Lic plate, or the trucks dscription. But i guess plates will be changed.  Hope they catch them and throw the book at them. Then throw the key away."
205144,Musky or Specks,2008-05-23 01:52:00,2710,Probably already burned up. I'd guess theives were after contents of the trailer only. Sometimes life sucks. Soory to hear about it.
205146,bassjnkie,2008-05-23 01:54:00,1101,I think it will be a good Idea to mention the area it was stolen. So people in the vasinity can really keep there eyes peeled.  I keep an eye out. Daniel
205147,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-23 01:54:00,3761,looks like you got me lookin out for you here in Oshawa.
205153,Fish Farmer,2008-05-23 02:03:00,2234,I'll be watchin. I can feel for the guy. I've had things stole from me also.
205217,bigfish1965,2008-05-23 03:53:00,3382,Stolen from the Niagara region...but could be anywhere by now.
205231,nofish4me,2008-05-23 06:04:00,404,"Probably not far from your place, but I'll keep an eye open for it. Hope it's not been changed to ash grey in colour, by now."
205233,Big Cliff,2008-05-23 08:39:00,6899,"Rick, if you can get me a list and SN's of any of the mowers, trimmers, etc (any power equipment) I'll post a list at our shop in case someone tries to either get it serviced or sell it. I'll keep an eye out here in the Lindsay area for the truck and trailer."
205287,Reef Runner,2008-05-23 13:23:00,981,"A dang shame.  I'll keep my eyes peeled in the Big Smoke, Mississauga and the drive to Orillia this weekend."
205334,bassjnkie,2008-05-23 15:27:00,1101," I put out the word on the CB yesterday and this morning. Hope this stuff can be found, it's a sad thing.  Daniel"
205336,muskymike,2008-05-23 15:31:00,772,Hopefully it hasnt made its way to Ohsweken. Took a drive by there a few days ago and man there are a lot of vehicles in the fields up there.  I will keep an eye out in the Creek/Hammer/Burlington/Oakville/Sauga way for you.  Hope they find it.
205337,TJQ,2008-05-23 15:37:00,7806,Any pictures of it??
205345,smbhunter,2008-05-23 15:59:00,186,"I'll keep a look out in the Toronto area for you. My dad does gardening/landscaping and has had a couple trucks and some equipment stolen from him in the past. The vehicle was found in every case, but all the equipment was gone. My dad now heavily marks all of his machinery and tools by spray painting everything with his company colours and engraving the power equipment with the company initials. Since he started doing this 10 years ago, he has never had anything stolen, except from one of his drivers, who took some power equipment last fall. I'm sure something will turn up, but hopefully the thief will be caught and charged heavily."
