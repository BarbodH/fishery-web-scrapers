After a swig of beer Pigsticker said, ""Well, we had Iwo Jima.""  Arching his eyebrows, Greencoachdawg replied, ""We had the Battle of Midway.""  ""Not entirely true"", responded the Pigsticker. ""Some of those pilots were Marines; in fact, Henderson Field on Guadalcanal was named after a Marine pilot killed at the Battle of Midway.""  Greencoachdawg responded, ""Point taken."" Pigsticker then said, ""We Marines were born at Tun Tavern!""  Greencoachdawg, nodding agreement, says, ""But we had John Paul Jones.""  The argument continued until Greencoachdawg came up with what he thought would end the discussion. With a flourish of finality he said, ""The Navy invented sex!""  Pigsticke replied, ""That's true, but it was the Marines who introduced it to women!"""
