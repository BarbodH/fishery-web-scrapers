204298,Stoty,2008-05-21 14:07:00,2910,"Thanks Duber. The rod is brand new, and the guides are fine. I found a kink in the line of the spool, probably a result of line slip. I have since respooled with a mono backing and also wet the line before re-spooling.  Hopefully this will solve my problem."
204337,Sinker,2008-05-21 15:43:00,8692,Any way you look at it.......vanish is garbage!! IMO  Can't stand that stuff. Nothing but a headache for me.  I've never had PP break though.....unless I cut it. You can anchor a boat with 50lb.....LOL.  Sinker
204339,Stoty,2008-05-21 15:45:00,2910,"I am having the opposite experience as you....I haven't had a problem with Vanish yet, but am having issues with PP. To each their own, I guess."
204379,Bitsmith2k,2008-05-21 17:59:00,396,"the only time i've had PP break on me, it was due to a bad guide.. rod was brand new too,  the crack was so fine that you couldnt see it.. the q-tip confirmed it though.."
204486,Mike the Pike,2008-05-21 22:50:00,3421,Buy some Stren Super Braid you will like it better than Power Pro I know I use both.
204694,singingdog,2008-05-22 10:16:00,1047,"Somethings not right. I have been fishing 20 lb PP for 3 years with no problems at all. Maybe you got a bad batch? 90% of the time, no leader is required. I find it amusing that folks think they need an ""invisible"" leader when they are throwing baits with 3 big treble hooks hanging off their belly: fish are not that discriminating."
204707,lew,2008-05-22 11:21:00,12767," I can't speak for anyone else, but personally I use 130 # fluoro leaders on all my musky rods and it has nothing to do with invisibility. The fluoro is much easier on the fish when they roll up in the line, plus it doesn't kink up like wire leaders do.  Before I switched to Seaguar several years ago, I was using Stringese leaders at about $6 each and would often have to discard the leader due to kinks after even one fish, and on a good day with 6 or 7 muskies and an equal number of leaders ruined, it tends to get rather expensive.  Good fluoro leaders will outlast wire 20-1  At least that's my take on things"
204823,limeyangler,2008-05-22 15:54:00,5204,"Hey Stoty,  I would go with what a lot of the others are saying, powerpro with a flouro leader. Only problem i have ever had with flouro is knot strength,. To combat this i use a Palomar Knot or Trilene Knot. Definitely go with the swivel in my humble opinion, the only time i dont use a swivel is for ice fishing cuz my fishfinder shows it and makes for a messy screen so i will join line to line."
204836,Stoty,2008-05-22 16:14:00,2910,"Lew, and Limey,  Thanks for the tips, I am def going to try flouro leaders."
204840,BillM,2008-05-22 16:16:00,17367,"Lew, 6 or 7 muskie days?  We REALLY need to get out this year together *cough* *hint* *cough*"
204876,spyder3g,2008-05-22 17:39:00,50,"Hi guys,  My name is Vladimir and I'm from Toronto. I read this forum a lot, but have not post anything yet. I had the same problem as Stoti does. I tested 3 different braided lines (the last one was Schtern) and sometimes the cast was finished with the same result - the lure went to China (in the middle of Grand river under Caledonia bridge). However, a friend of mine, who's just started fishing, successfully uses braided lines. I noticed only one difference in casting. I pull my lure almost twice a distance he does (lines were the same at that time). I think there is too much pressure to the line if any wing knot. The braided line may be not as good for dynamic pressure. However in static pressure the line is extremely strong. I tested that. I tied  a piece of lead to my Schtern braided line tied the line to the tree and frown the lead in the river. I found that the braided line always brakes; however, mono  works as a spring and brakes much less than braided line."
199702,Garry2Rs,2008-05-11 00:36:00,1425,"Most of the time you don't need the fluro leader. Bass, Pike, Walleye, Musky and Crappie aren't line shy within reason. They are aggressive feeders and will hit a bait towed on 1/4 inch nylon rope if in will fit in their mouth, and their in the mood. I don't know that much about salmoides, but I do recall from my fly fishing days, that DRAG is a big downer. If you don't understand what drag is, it's when the current pulling on the line, that is laying on the water, causes the bait to move in an unnatural way. Fly casters use long fine leaders because the smaller the line diameter, the less drag effects it...Many trout fishers and fly casters don't know this...They believe that the fish can see the line and are line shy...In my opinion this is a myth.  Fish have a brain that is less than the size of a pea.  They are dumber than dirt, but they know if it doesn't look right. DRAG is your enemy, not visibility...fish don't care if it's wearing a collar and on a steel chain, they will eat anything that looks wounded, distracted or dying. Garry2R's"
203866,Stoty,2008-05-20 19:22:00,2910,"So, I used the BRAND NEW PowerPro I bought last week, yesterday......NOT very impressed with it.  For whatever reason, twice when I took a cast (hard cast because I was throwing into the wind), the line snapped and my lure when SPLASH. The line didnt break at the knot, it broke at a random spot in the middle of the cast. I wasnt too happy to lose my only remaining black spinnerbait!!!  I have another new pack of PowerPro (unopened), that is going right back to Canadian Tire for a refund. I knew I should have stuck with the Vanish Flourocarbon!  Any ideas as to why it would snap there? I am guessing a ""bad batch"". Since I have only used the line once, is there anything I can do with reguards to a refund? (no package or reciept though). Maybe contact PowerPro directly?"
203890,Reef Runner,2008-05-20 19:59:00,981,"I have a number of guesses.  1.  Bad batch 2.  Birdsnest and a hard throw with a heavy lure. 3.  No mono backing maybe?  Line could have wound around itself in the reel. 4.  rough edges on the eyes of your rod might be causing slight abrasion on the line.  I've been using PP for about 2 or 3 years now and would not give it up.  There are alot of guys here who swear by it, with good reason.  I've heard of bad batches being bought at CTC.  Return it and get it from another retailer.  rules to follow.  Mono backing, (double) uni to uni, spool on tight."
204294,duber,2008-05-21 13:57:00,220,"I would check your line guides first.PP is not real abrasion resistant.It would seem uncharactoristic of pp to break like that.I swear buy the stuff and have used it for the last 4 years with no issues.Run a Q-tip all around your line guides and see if they grab some cotton of the soft end.  Good luck and let us know how you make out,"
