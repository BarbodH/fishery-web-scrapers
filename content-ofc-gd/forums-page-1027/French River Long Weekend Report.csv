204503,steve_paul,2008-05-21 23:23:00,658,"Loaded the truck and boat Thursday and hit the road early with my kids, Jess and Ryan, for 4 days at the French River.    Ride up that early was easy, very little traffic and through the worst parts before too many people are up and on the road.  Always get a laugh at this sign as you get to Noelville - glad they didn't tell me to go North in Noelville or I would have been toast    Found out also that the US is not the only place going thru Elections - good luck Bud    We were in the water, at the island and unloaded by 11am and time to relax a bit before getting the cottage all set up    That also was about the last we saw of the sun.  Lots of rain for the time we were there, very cold temps and had a hard time finding any water over 49 degrees.  Fishing was tough, we found lots of fish on the finder but could not get them to take any of our offerings - tried slow small presentations, worms, minnows, Gulp Alive, very slow trolling, worm harnesses, pretty much everything I could think of but the pickerel just weren't taking.  Luckily I packed lots of other cottage goodies so the kids and I wouldn't starve (very important fact to a big guy like me)      The long weekend did give us an opportunity to test out the new boat (Lund SSV 16 with Merc 30HP 2 stroke) that we bought last fall.  It ran like a charm, was great on gas ($21 for the weekend  ) and was very comfortable for the 3 of us to fish from    In between fishing we spent lots of time warming up by the fire in the cottage and drying out before our next run    Jess warming up with my cousins dog Arthur    We did get into some pike though which kept our fishing spirits up and a couple will eventually make it to the deep fryer      All in all, a very wet cold weekend but had an incredible time with the kids so no complaints.  It is always a pleasure just to get up to the French River and enjoy the beauty of it.  Always get some great pics at the very least and memories that last a lifetime.  Full Moon shot on the river    The Road Runner Tree (if you find it there are some big muskie hanging around there just waiting for the opener)    Til the next trip over the Canada Day Holiday  "

204725,Greencoachdog,2008-05-22 12:06:00,8163,"Great report and pics!!!  I've seen that sign in Noelville, everything is north to me up there!"
204732,bigcreekdad,2008-05-22 12:20:00,546,"Where is your cottage? I love that area. Also, did you vote for Bud while you were at the Dokis Marina?"
204733,BillM,2008-05-22 12:20:00,17367,"Awesome pics!!  I love the French, definitely my favourite place to fish   Where abouts are you located on the French?  Main channel?  My dad and I are heading up for the June 7th opener, I *think* I know where abouts those trees are.....  That cottage looks awful familiar  The fish in my avatar was caught just around the corner from the 'Cross'."
204749,Reef Runner,2008-05-22 13:04:00,981,"Nice report.  I love the French, although as I don't go often, been pretty tough fishing fro me.  I will look for that road runner tree...lol, but they all look like that up there.haha.  Thanks for sharing,  reefrunner"
204893,limeyangler,2008-05-22 18:15:00,5204,"Great report, great pics, enjoyed reading it, thanks."
204896,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-22 18:32:00,0,Thanks for the report. The weather did suck but its always great to get away from the city and enjoy what the North has to offer. And the food always tastes better up there.
205028,fishindevil,2008-05-22 23:05:00,6254,"Sounds like a good time had by all !!!!.  .and dont fret about the fishing,it wasnt that good at the bay of quinte either,and at least you guys did get a few pike to keep it interesting !!,and well the weather sure sucked!!!!!!.  ..and the way i see it it will only get better,and you did have a nice warm cottage to go to,with your family....thanks for the report    cheers"
205044,steve_paul,2008-05-22 23:23:00,658," First political party to bring that in gets my vote!!!!!!!!!!  I should have asked Bud if that was part of his plan.   They are lucky but I am lucky too, Ryan handles the boat all weekend so I get to fish and relax, Jess helps me clean the fish and with the cooking so it all evens out.   Also fed them Chili, Beef Jerky and Pepperettes from Cleo's in Noelville.  Life was not that good on the way home   I don't think I get a vote up there unfortuneately.   It is so different up there, nothing beats an early morning coffee on the deck just listening to the sounds of the river - no cars, no other noise, just water, nature and the occasional outboard - everything God intended us to hear."
