I am departing off to Algonquin next wednesday and im going to bring a pool thermometer to gauge the temps. Can anyone explain the OPTIMAL temperatures for MOST of the Ontario game fish?  Ive heard its about 52 degrees for Trout??  Thanks,  Pachone"
204838,BillM,2008-05-22 16:15:00,17367,"From what I've read for spring lakers, anywhere from 50-58 degree's."
204845,Musky or Specks,2008-05-22 16:20:00,2710,For lakers 52 sounds right but I find brookies most active 60-64.
204851,Pachone,2008-05-22 16:31:00,276,Too cold and they dont feed? Too hot and they go deeper? Trout are tricky lil guys
204856,limeyangler,2008-05-22 16:48:00,5204,"Lakers like cold water, hence why they are...mostly....found in deeper water in the summer months. Spring fishing is awesome up here in Northwestern Ontario because its not long since the ice went out and they can be found in the shallows too. During the summer i would say what the others are saying is right...45 - 55 degrees is about right. Dont know how deep your pool thermometer will go but temps at the surface wil be different from temps at mid range and deeper waters so dont know how useful that will be. I can pick up the thermoclineson my fishfinder and fish either above or below depending on where the fish are showing."
204857,Billy Bob,2008-05-22 16:48:00,5865,"Water temps are really just a gauge to where active fish of any species will be found, however they can also be found and caught out of there optima temperatures if there is a boom in forage be it a insect hatch or bait fish.  To be honest you will not accomplish all that much with the pool temp gauge other than waste valuable fishing time. You are going to be there anyways no matter what water temps you find. You just have to find fish, match the hatch and have a good presentation.  FISH + LOCATION + PRESENTATION = SUCCESS  Good Luck, Bob"
