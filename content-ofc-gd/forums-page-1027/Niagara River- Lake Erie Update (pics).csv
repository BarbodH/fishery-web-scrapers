May 8th to May 20th Niagara Region report:  Perch: are still going good, fishing 27 to 60 feet of water. US waters have been better for us although many locals are getting them on the Canadian side. Small minnows have been the top bait.    Smallmouth Bass (US waters Erie): Fishing remains good! Lots of anglers out on the lake/river enjoying the early bite! Bass are found in depths from 3 feet out to 36 feet for us. Live minnows/tubes/Slammers (drop shot bait)/ jerk baits/ spoons all have been taken fish depending on the day. The best bite has been with live minnows! Crazy numbers!!! Upper river is producing BIG numbers of smaller fish, with some bigger fish in the mix:       Lower Niagara Steelhead: With the Late season this year and cooler nights we been getting the Lower Niagara is still LOADED with steelhead! current temps as of yesterday were 48.2 degrees. Lots of ""fresh silvers"" around with good mix of drop backs and darker spawning fish still doing there thing. We getting lots of trout dropping eggs. With these water temps, trout pulling super hard and lots of high flying jumps  yarn/eggs/minnows/pink worms all will take trout.       Fly Fishing: We been getting lots of steelhead on the Fly both from shore and the boat. Water temps are perfect for Fly Fishing! Our last trip we hooked 17 landed 11! This day was all captured on film by The Canadian Fly Fisher. (Fly Max Films) we'll let you all know when it's ready! Some killer runs and high flying jumps caught on camera      See you on the River,"
