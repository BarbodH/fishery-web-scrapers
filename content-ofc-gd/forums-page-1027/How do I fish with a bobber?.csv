204912,ccmtcanada,2008-05-22 19:08:00,7971,"It depends how deep the water is that you are fishing.  When we take our little one panfishing, the water is usually between 2 and 4 feet deep.  Simple worm an hook will catch most panfish.  I will generally start out by placing the bobber so that the worm/hook is just off bottom.  If nothing happens, then I'll raise it 6 inches at a time until there is some action.   The best places to put your line is near some kind of structure.....docks, weeds, rocks, walls etc....  Where are you located?  Panfish shouldn't be too difficult to find."
204918,Mike Pike,2008-05-22 19:14:00,1332,"Worm on a hook is always good.  Catches everything and anything.  As for length, you have to experiment.  Keep changing the length til you get a fish then that's the pattern you stick with.  See, simple.  Hey, how did you make out at 50 point when you went???  I wanted to send you a reply about the pond there but the thread was locked."
204921,Stoty,2008-05-22 19:18:00,2910," 1) Depends what depth the fish are at. Generally 3-4 feet is a good place to start. 2) Ya, that will always work, but if you dont have worms/minnows try small ""crappie"" jigs (1"" tubes & grubs) 3) I would invest in some small (1/32 oz jig heads), that way you dont have to worry about attaching splitshot to your line.  Try to fish near structure/cover (weedbeds, rocks, docks, steep ledges, etc)"
204922,YUMMYAPPLE,2008-05-22 19:19:00,9,"Oh guys, what sized hook should I use?"
204928,limeyangler,2008-05-22 19:24:00,5204,  Definitely try this
204934,Reef Runner,2008-05-22 19:32:00,981,"small hook or jig head, about a foot or two off the bottom.  Wait for bobber to go under or if you see it move to the side, set the hook in the opposite direction.  Best of luck."
204938,YUMMYAPPLE,2008-05-22 19:36:00,9,"Hi guys, thanks for helping.  I already have a jig head but I'm hesitant to use it for the following reasons: 1) The hook on it is pretty big. Much bigger than my smallest hook. I think it is too big for panfish.  2)  I dont think that the jig head is heavy enough to hold down a bobber. Multiple split shots are heavier.  What are the advantages of a jig head over a hook and a split shot?"
204941,Stoty,2008-05-22 19:42:00,2910," Jig head had the weight built right into it.  Jigheads are pretty cheap, so I recommend getting a bunch of different sizes to suit the conditions. (If its windy, go with a heavier jighead, etc)"
204943,highdrifter,2008-05-22 19:47:00,2534,What is this?  Fishing 101?!  Give a hoot?  Read a book.
204944,Stoty,2008-05-22 19:48:00,2910,"This is what you should pick up...they are available at pretty much any tackle store (Wal-mart, Canadian Tire included)  "
204945,Dartee,2008-05-22 19:53:00,47," What are you tring to say by ""hold down a bobber"" ?  It sort of reads like your trying to pull the bobber under.  The bobber needs to float on the surface and suspend the bait at the chosen depth. I hope your not putting so much weight on that the bobber is sinking. A jig head should be sufficient weight."

You have slipped up a number of times in the posts so you need to fade back into the backround and consider your joke as complete.  Art
