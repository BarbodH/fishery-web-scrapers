204485,MuddyWater,2008-05-21 22:46:00,218,i would go with sensation for that or magnathin. i love magnathin anything thats thin lol. oh yea that spider wire super mono isnt bad either
204487,Mike Pike,2008-05-21 22:52:00,1332,"I'm partial to the Berkley Trilene myself, John.   I mostly fish wth the XT Extra Tough in clear.  Sometmes I'll spool up with the XL Smooth Casting in clear too.  It's a little more limp and supposed to allow longer casts.  Hard to judge if it really makes much of a difference but it does in my mind so I'll get it when shore fishing and my casts really have to get out there."
204492,tibbs,2008-05-21 22:59:00,650,I'm with Mike i like Trilene XL Smooth Cast. It's a good all around line for a great price.

204820,CLofchik,2008-05-22 15:49:00,854,"Silver Thread! Or plain old school Ande.  The only reason Trilene seems ""tough"" is because they downrate it, 14lb test and labelled 10lb!"
205004,JFR,2008-05-22 21:58:00,498,"If you really must use mono lines, I have had great success with  Ande Tournament Green,  and Maxima lines.  Both are superior to anything that Berkely offers.  Have you given thought to one of the braided lines in 10 or 8# test? Both have a very small diameter.  The 8# is listed as 1# diameter.  John"
205007,muttfish,2008-05-22 22:22:00,20,"only berkley xt for me,used that spider wire but snaps it so easy, at the same I have never tried all the lines out there so I cannot give you my best advice. but line isn't very expensive so I would try every line out there till you find the one you like best, its like finding the perfect pizza joint you have to try them, here in the hammer I would only recommend dine in pizza at Buddys Roadhouse, all the food is good there"
