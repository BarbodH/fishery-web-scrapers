204590,TangerineDream,2008-05-22 01:52:00,47,Well Stoney was good..... Cold and hot.... Braved the boughts of rain and hail.... Thought maybe either hungry or stupid....  Naw walleyes on the brain...  Stayed at Pine Vista... Had walleyes every time we went out.... Or should I say every spot we hit except for the Sunday night the front came in....    Early morning riser...    Managed a nice crappie too   The biggest came from the hells gate entry channel in 15-20 fow    Got into the canoe for awhile...    And as usual...   This house amazes me every time I pass it!   Wife was enjoying the wildlife in action....   Said I wasn't in the mood.... Mmmm walleyes... they were calling me  Cabins were nice once again...    And the wildlife didn't dissappoint....    Had a nice bbq...   All in all a nice weekend...    Special thanks to Stoty and others for maps..... Even though we were supposed to meet up and were 300 yards from each other lol...

We were cut short by the car accident involving my sister's daughter as in my previous post. This really put a damper on this weekend and most of this week. Am going up with my dad on the weekend if everything goes well."
