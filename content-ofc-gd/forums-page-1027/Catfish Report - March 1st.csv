204802,Rich,2008-05-22 15:21:00,3927,"A buddy and I have been planning a trip for cats for quite some time now and our schedules finally collaborated as we headed out to some local spots. Things were slow.  To start, Markus grabbed a duck as it flew by for a quick snack.    LOL, actually this duck just decided to attack his cut bait, crazy ducks! Funny how docile this duck was when he was removing the hook from it. It flew away just fine.  Markus scored the first fish of the day while he was sending a text message. We were confused by the fight, couldn't tell whether it was a big bullhead or a small channel cat, then we realized that Mr. Sheephead had come to visit.    This fish was added to my cutbait collection. Markus showed me how to scoop the lucky stones in their head too... which turned out to be more cursed than lucky, because things slowed right down after that.  We moved to ""Area 57"" where I ""guaranteed"" we'd catch some cats, they'd just be small. Of course, the spot made a liar out of me.  Markus nailed a bullhead though. As it got dark and we were right about to call it quits, FINALLY my rod bent over and I was into the one and only channel cat of the night. A scrappy fish, but not big. Markus damn near went up to his waist in quicksand to grab it for me too, LOL    Well things were slow, but I guess when it's the cold front of the century that is to be expected. What happened to MAY?!  Anyway, fish or no fish. Like all my trips with Mark I had a great time. Look forward to doing it again sometime. Perhaps next time we won't need the winter clothes though,"
204806,Reef Runner,2008-05-22 15:26:00,981,You got some great friends there rich!  Grabbin' ducks in mid-flight and wading through quicksand to grab fish.  lol.  Look like you had a great time.  Thanks for postin'.  reefrunner
204828,Victor,2008-05-22 16:02:00,1609,i was hoping you would tell us how the bbq duck tastes  lol  Still a nice day out though! Seems like it's finally going to warm up...
204847,highdrifter,2008-05-22 16:25:00,2534,Hey that duck is out of season!  How very wrong and unethical..  Where art thou Danbo?!!  Good report brotha.  HD
204853,crappieperchhunter,2008-05-22 16:35:00,2582,"Good outing Rich. Can't be fishing in shorts and T's and hauling them in every time out. I think I recognize the location of your first 2 pictures...but I won't tell. BTW I think I lost my sunglasses down there the night I was out with you and the ""BOSS"".  Take care and keep the reports coming."
204879,Markus,2008-05-22 17:41:00,25,"Thanks for taking me to a few of your cat spots Rich.  I enjoyed that.  Hopefully we'll get out again sometime soon.  The drake didn't even budge, but like any typical hen....show them the right piece of meat and they cant resist gobbling it down."
205022,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-22 22:55:00,0,Nice cat! I guess the water is still too cold for the big ones and Markus??? Stop choking the chicken! lol
