Although it was prime walleye condition out there with the cloudy and breezy weather. This weekend its suppose to be sunny so it will undoubtable be a bit harder."
204932,DMASSE,2008-05-22 19:31:00,420,I fished Fenlon on the weekend.   The fishing was good but not as good as other years.  The problem was that the dam was at full force so the current was very strong (hard to fish) We are going to bobcaygeon again on sat. It was fairly good...  Dave
