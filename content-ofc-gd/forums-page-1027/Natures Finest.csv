204478,MuddyWater,2008-05-21 22:29:00,218,MMMMMMMMMMM i freakin forgot about morels this time of year!!!!!
204495,Chuck Best,2008-05-21 23:06:00,308,"Great find bud....We got nine from the yard here,2 years ago ,but none last year.....The rain today should help,if it would only get a little warmer.....But for sure ,now is the time to go a lookin'.......TC and tight lines....Chuck"
204549,ketchenany,2008-05-22 00:29:00,3229,"Love to try those, can you shed some light on what kind of area they grow in?  Not your spot just what to look for, we have a lot of woods that I can access."
204552,Fisherman,2008-05-22 00:41:00,7201,"Ya, no problem but, so far I would honestly have to say that hardwood forests are slightly better than coniferous.  Some swear that pine woods are better, some the other.  My best so far is around maple with rotting wood/leaves etc on the ground with good shade.  Ditches in some areas close to apple orchards can be good too.   These mushrooms, ""morrels"" are about as easily to identify as coil of dog poop on your lawn, no mistaking them.  Check the link for some others such as giant puffballs and shaggy manes. Here: http://www.mdc.mo.gov/nathis/mushrooms/mushroom/edible.htm"
204562,oxcowboy,2008-05-22 00:59:00,544,"those are very delicious, ours down here have already ran their course, but cant wait till next year.  good find for sure.  jason"
204638,ehg,2008-05-22 03:03:00,2666,"Thats some nice looking yellow morels. Usually i'll find morels in last week of April or first week of May, i think they are a couple weeks behind even here, i'll go take a look outside Toronto might still be some with this cool wet weather.  That's good food and 'organic' as well.  ehg"
204691,Big Cliff,2008-05-22 09:25:00,6899,"Thank you very much for that link Fisherman, really helpful!  If you ever get some fresh puff balls in the fall, try dehydrating them. Just cut them into slices about 1/2"" thick and put them in your dehydrator for about 1-2 days. They will keep for years and make a wonderful addition to sauces, soups, and stews."
204712,Fisherman,2008-05-22 11:38:00,7201,"You're most welcome Big Cliff, I may have to get a dehydrator one of these days, just for that and fruits."
204827,limeyangler,2008-05-22 16:01:00,5204,"Thanks for the post Fisherman, very interesting. our woods here are packed with mushrooms and fungus of all sorts, your link has shown me that quite a few are edible, i will be careful, sooooo if ya see no more posts from me you'll know what happened"
204835,Reef Runner,2008-05-22 16:13:00,981,"  Or if your posts are nothing but hysterical laughter we'll give you a couple days.  lol.  Awsome link Fisherman, Thanks.  My family used to take long excursions looking for mushrooms and a great many Polish recipies include wild mushrooms.  Something I've been interested in getting back into."
204870,walleyejigger,2008-05-22 17:17:00,876,"thanks for the link, i've been eating buckets of false morrels  every year for as long as i can remember, and now see they are considered poisinous....somewhat  gonna have to send that limk to a bunch of friends and family"
204882,Scott S,2008-05-22 17:51:00,203,"I've been waiting for the warmer temps.With a little heat they should really start to pop up! I haven't been to my spot yet, but you made me hungry with that picture! Scooter"
