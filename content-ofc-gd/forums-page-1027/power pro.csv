205084,buckster,2008-05-23 00:26:00,530,Wanted to give powerpro a shot for simcoe whitefish..........  So what lb test do y'alls use?   and what lb floro leader?
205085,Guest gbfisher,2008-05-23 00:41:00,0,No need to buy more if you have a real already set up. I use 35lb power pro with a 12 floro lead. The 35lb is on a real I use for bouncing pics. The floro leader is good for what ever you can catch on Simcoe. Never know when you might  luck into a 30 plus laker. You could use smaller diam line but I have found that thicker diam is better when used for ice fishing for a couple of reasons.  
205090,MuddyWater,2008-05-23 00:50:00,218,ive heard that braids arnt the best for whities they got odd mouths that tear easily unless your using a meegs type dealy
205100,Sinker,2008-05-23 00:59:00,8692,"I was using 50lb on the weekend, with an 8lb mono lead. I like to keep my leader as long as my rod on simcoe....its super clear.  worked fine, we hauled them like crazy. My first time using braid for them.  Sinker"
205120,buckster,2008-05-23 01:20:00,530,i used 10lb for the first time icefishing this year and its kinda nice... inside the clam only lol.   Little to thin i found.  kinda tangly
205124,Garry2Rs,2008-05-23 01:24:00,1425,"If you're going to use a leader with braid, here's an idea I picked up from Bass Pro and Senko maker Gary Yamamoto... Make the leader long enough so that when you land a fish you have the knot and several turns of leader on the reel. The weakest parts of your set-up are the leader to line Uni to Uni knots...Get them on the reel, safely out of the way if there are any boat side heroics."

205210,limeyangler,2008-05-23 03:06:00,5204,I was using 8lb micro ice braid with uni knot attached 8lb flouro leader. Used at least 10 feet of leader as thew whities on this particular lake spook easy. ust say the braid was great for bite detection and hook setting.
