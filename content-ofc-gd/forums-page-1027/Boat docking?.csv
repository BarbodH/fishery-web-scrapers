There is an outside chance that I may be able to dock it at Beans place but if not any suggestions?  How much should I expect to pay for the season?  I think Cliff said a place near him might have some docks?  Is that right Big Cliff?  I don't think I want to dock it up here, not too comfortable going out on G Bay until I get used to /learn more about operating a boat.  Thanks Maureen"

205009,Guest gbfisher,2008-05-22 22:26:00,0,Going rates range from $30 to $100/ft around Severn Sound. Why go somewhere else to learn about what you have so much of in your own back yard? Best place to start if ya ask me.  Good luck with your decision.

I may dock it near by if I can afford it, but then someone has to spend the gas to come show me what I need to know.  Maureen"
