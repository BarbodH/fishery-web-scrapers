Personal Best performance by my dog, but didn't make ""Winners Pack"" Oh well. When they were done winners pack (after a long time trying to find a Cottontail) a couple or fellas said they would have been done sooner if my dog had of been there to find the rabbit (another personal best). My dog can be all over the place, but she sure can sniff out a rabbit, problem is she's good on a cold trail and other dogs won't honour what she's found."
