681397,mistaredone,2012-03-29 04:14:00,913,Im lookng for a place that rents ski boats/jet skis in or around Haliburton and only found a place in Muskoka that does that sort of thing.  I was hoping someone might have a marina in mind that I could look up.  I tried google with no luck.  Thanks

681411,singingdog,2012-03-29 10:31:00,1047,Jet skis are not allowed on any lakes in the Haliburton area. Try the Muskokas....they love that buzzy irritating stuff.
681440,chris.brock,2012-03-29 12:28:00,4053,"try Prentice Power Sports, just south of Minden Wedgewood Marina, 12 Mile Lk north of Minden, they are closed in the winter but should be starting up now or, Kenesis Lk Marina if you're up that way or Brysons in Carnarvon  705) 457-2282"
681543,mistaredone,2012-03-29 15:50:00,913,"  Ha, Ha!  That's awesome!  Like I said it's for a stag, I already have a cottage booked on Redstone.  I'll be bringing my bass boat to chase some skis, I just need enough toys so I dont have to guide for the weekend.  Thanks to all for the links"
681660,singingdog,2012-03-29 19:58:00,1047,"If you are on Redstone, Kinnesis Lake Marina would be the closest spot to rent."
681663,captpierre,2012-03-29 20:04:00,2521,  Didn't know there are muskies in Redstone?
681677,mistaredone,2012-03-29 20:32:00,913,If not I wouldnt have to drive far to find them but id assume they would be in there.
681711,mistaredone,2012-03-29 21:31:00,913,Quick google and no word of skies on redstone so I'll have to make a short drive or redstone has a rare tribe of tight lipped group of fisherman;)
681772,singingdog,2012-03-30 00:00:00,1047,"No musky that I know of. You are right, you won't have to drive far."
682439,fishboy,2012-04-01 02:11:00,550,Wedgewood on 12 mile rents for sure; there's also a guy who sells watercraft just across from the Pepper Mill restaurant a bit further up 35; not sure if he rents tho
682469,Dave Bailey,2012-04-01 10:37:00,1641,"RPM Marina on Kashagawigamog advertises rentals, but I'm not certain of exactly what. It used to be Robert's Marina, a chap named Craig Bowker has taken it over. His web site is still being set up, you can contact them at 1-705-457-1473"
