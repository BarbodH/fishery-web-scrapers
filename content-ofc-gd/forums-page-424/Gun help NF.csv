681879,ch312,2012-03-30 04:08:00,1590,"does buying a 3.5"" gun mean you always need to use the more expensive bigger shells? i dont think so. but, its nice having the extra capacity they provide when using buckshot, steel, and turkey loads. basically, its nice having the extra pellet count when you need it. a 2 3/4"" gun can do anything a 3 1/2"" gun can, but the bigger shell often produces superior patterns.  175-200 yards should never be attempted with a shotgun by anyone and only a fine tuned rifle is capable of those ranges? new to firearms, are we?"
681899,dave524,2012-03-30 11:50:00,4508," I shot the first southern Ontario controlled hunter number shotgun hunt in 76 or 77 , back when shotgun slug technology was pretty much the antiquated Foster type slug in your favourite bird gun. Since the start of the controlled hunts, muzzleloaders have always been an alternative to a shotgun and at that time a far better choice for accuracy and range. Slug gun technology has come a long way since then but 35 seasons and a lot of deer later I have never regetted sticking to the old smokepole, just another option few consider for the southern Ontario deer hunts. Why hunt with a shotgun when you can use a real rifle"
681901,Billy Bob,2012-03-30 11:58:00,5865," OH, OK......I'll play along.....since I know nothing about those new fanged dangled things they call sabot slugs maybe you can teach me....  But I do know that a sabot slug muzzle velocity ranges anywhere from 1400 to 1700 fps....remember I said MUZZLE velocity.....with a range of 1700 to 2400 foot lbs of energy at the MUZZLE....quite impressive to start off....right.  But here's where it gets a little baffling for me at least....at a distance of only 125 yards those sabot slugs have lost a lot of energy and velocity (by the way this is the recommended limit for slugs) and now that same slug is down to about 1100 fps and foot lbs of energy has been reduce in about HALF.....now that's at 125 yards....once you get beyond that distance the speed of that slug and the energy behind it REALLY drops off....  Now going back to your recommended distance of 175 - 200 yards the energy and velocity (speed) of those new fanged dangled slugs are really dropping off....as a matter of fact I already mentioned at 175 yards that slug will drop 9.9"" on a GOOD DAY....at 200 yards I would have to estimate it over 15""....  So with all that scientific infomation available to us how high would you have to aim in order to put that new fanged dangled sabot slug into the boiler room of a whitetail deer ? ? ?....OH WAIT....we forgot about wind drift didn't we....huh, who would of thought that a small wind of only 10 miles per hour could move that new fanged dangled sabot slug out of the killing zone....wait wait....I did....Ballistics have shown us that a MILD 10 mph cross wind will move that slug over about 6"" at 125 yards....so at 200 yards that calculates to at least 1 FOOT left or right of the aim target....  So now how are you going to aim at the distance of 200 yards a that deer in hopefully a clearing with no other hunters around.....  Well my new fanged dangled sabot shooter has a 2.5X scope on it with a special eye relief that shotgun scopes have because of the BRUISING kick these 12 gauge shotguns deliver while shooting any kind of slug....but you know what......2.5X scope is really not made to make shots at 200 yards....but you could use a rifle scope with a eye relief of 3-4"" and take the chance of that scope leaving a bite mark on your forehead....if I met you I could probably tell if you had the pleasure of this experience as many times the scare is still there.....but maybe you are using the improper scope and keep you head and cheek back to prevent this...only problem is now you don't have a good cheek weld to the stock and in doing so you will never become a good shot, not to mentions a sharpshooter that is needed to pull off this stunt....YES I said STUNT because it is very irresponsible to shoot at a whitetail deer at 175-200 yards with a SHOTGUN....even with those new fanged dangle sabot slugs I know nothing about according to you sir.  BTW the ESTIMATED answer would be depending on the cross wind direction and which way this whitetail is looking and HOPEFULLY he is completely broadside for this stunt shot.....15"" high and about 12"" right or left depending on wind direction.....GOOD LUCK with that......but if you can make that shot I am willing to invite you down to my gun club range to witness this.  As far as the weight of the gun....I'm not even going to address that...  Good Luck Hunting, Bob"
681902,GbayGiant,2012-03-30 12:10:00,1780,I have to agree with Bob in this situation. If you plan on shooting over 100 yards with your shotgun. Buy a rifle.
681903,BillM,2012-03-30 12:11:00,17367,I'd like to see all these guys dropping deer at 200 yards with a shotgun.   Talk about internet heros!
681904,dave524,2012-03-30 12:15:00,4508, Muzzleloaders are legal in controlled southern Ontario hunts
681909,GbayGiant,2012-03-30 12:20:00,1780, The number one reason why I do not except venison from other people. Can you say gut shot? Would you eat meat that was dropped in scat and washed?
681910,GbayGiant,2012-03-30 12:21:00,1780, That's a Muzzle load all right....
681912,Billy Bob,2012-03-30 12:38:00,5865, Although I never got into the muzzle loaders....this would be a much better choice for a 175-200 yard shot then any shotgun....  Are you guys up there allowed scopes on those smoke poles....some states down here prohibit scopes on muzzle loaders.....but not NYS.
681928,Sinker,2012-03-30 13:22:00,8692,"Yeah, scopes are good to go. We use them for turkkeys on our scatterguns as well.  S."
681970,Cookslav,2012-03-30 15:37:00,1457,"In the Hunter Safety course the reccomendation from my instructor as an effective range for a Sabot Slug through my 870 Supermag was ""not more then 150 yards."" Thats not by anymeans my recommendation....its just what I was told when I asked.  I personally don't think I'd squeeze the trigger if I had more then 100 yards between me and my Deer... My grouping tends to be about 4"" at that range (which I am aware is poor... )  I use Buck shot when driving for the obvious and Sabbot on the stand. But my in the ravine 30/06 is prefered for the longer shot."
681981,Billy Bob,2012-03-30 16:32:00,5865," Not really.....4"" groups at 100 yards is pretty good on a solid rest and is fantastic off hand for shotgunning....you'll bring a lot of venison home if you can do that day in and day out.  What makes shooting a 12 gauge shotgun accurate with sabot slugs is not only the pounding you take from each shot but also the expense for each sabot shell.....a box of 5 sabots will cost you about $20 ($4 per shot) where a box (20 per box) of your 30/06 shells can be had for about the same amount $20 ($1 per shot) unless you reload your own. And as ch312 did state, some sabots shoot better then others and you really need to try to find which one fires the best out of your rifled barrel.....and that can depend on the twist rate of that barrel....by the time you find the best one your shoulder is all black and blue and your broke...LOL..."
681990,Cookslav,2012-03-30 16:54:00,1457," Day in and out...not a chance, thats a good day, and I'm happy with that when I get there LOL! My Dads groupings are usually 2-3""...maybe I measure myself to to high a standard But then again our range may not be 100 yards ""exactly""...maybe I'm a horrible estimator and it's 70 LOL!!! (its a hunt camp....and it looks to be 100 yards give or take)  One thing for sure...sighting in sabots tend to leave a bruise"
681993,ch312,2012-03-30 17:04:00,1590,"  your post so full of fail  going by your train of thought you need a finely tuned rifle to shoot at 200 yards. i guess you arent aware that $100 milsurps, new rifles with a whopping $300 price tag, and even the lowly 22lr (mainly prairie dogs) is used by some hunters at these ranges. i guess you're also unaware of people successfully taking deer at these ranges with the slower and less powerful 20 gauge?  btw...you might want to have a clue what you're talking about before labeling yourself the next craig boddington.  winchester xp3 3"" sabot throws a 300gr slug at 2000 fps with 7.3"" drop at 175 yards. at 200 yards its still traveling 1380fps with 1260ft/lbs of energy and 10.5"" drop. considering 7-800ft/lbs is the minimum recommendation for deer sized game, you're good to go. a 10mph crosswind makes it drift 11"". winchester 3"" partition gold is even better at 200 yards. 1400fps, 1656 ft/lbs of energy, 11"" drop, and 10"" drift at 10mph.  thats assuming you're using a 100 yard zero. but, for these ranges a 150 yard zero would be much better as the drop at 200 yards will be 6-7"" and 2-3"" high at 90-100 yards. if you arent capable of compensating for a 6"" drop or 10"" drift, then i'll agree that you shouldn't be shooting at longer ranges. your ""estimated"" 15"" drop and 12"" drift is a far cry from 6"" drop and 10"" drift.  the guns are capable. the ammo is definitely capable. the last part of the equation is the hunter.  that said, i havent shot a deer past 100 yards because i prefer to get close. BUT, to come on here claiming that modern shotguns and ammo arent capable of 200 yard shots is absurd. like i said, get with the times. im not talking about using grandpas smooth bore with rifled slugs here. i'm talking a modern shotgun, fully rifled barrel, your preferred scope, and premium ammo.  2.5x scopes aren't good enough, so you have to use a rifle scope with lower eye relief? what on earth are you talking about? there are multiple 1.75-4x, 2-7x, 3-9x shotgun scopes available with longer eye relief for shotguns.   as for the weight differences. you're right, you shouldn't go there. i've shot many 3"" and 3 1/2"" guns and the weight difference is so minimal it isnt even noticeable while you're holding it.  3"" rem 870 express 28"" barrel 7 1/2 lbs 3.5"" rem 870 express super mag 28"" barrel 7 1/2 lbs  3"" mossberg 500 7 1/2 lbs 3.5"" mossberg 835 7 1/2 lbs  just to clarify, exactly what do you consider to be MUCH heavier?  like i said, you're going by technology or what you were taught 20 years ago..."
681997,ch312,2012-03-30 17:14:00,1590," im not trying to start a conflict here, but if you're getting a bruised shoulder from shooting you need to work on shooting form and possibly get your stock modified to fit you properly. not only will it help your body absorb recoil better, you'll often be a more confident and accurate shooter.  as for cost of slugs. considering most guns are close to zero after removing and remounting the scope and rifled barrel, it should only take a box to get back on zero and another box to make sure everything is proper. so, figure 2-3 boxes for the average guy shooting average distances. considering how much most hunters spend on gear, tags, gas, etc, $50-60 for 3 boxes of premium ammo isnt very expensive at all. why do people spend hundreds on a nice fishing rod when an el cheapo from canada tire will work? it's the exact same thing...people pay a premium for performance.  rifles are much cheaper, but around here we're limited to muzzleloaders and shotguns for deer. therefore, the more economical choice is a shotgun with rifled barrel."
681998,Billy Bob,2012-03-30 17:14:00,5865,BEAUTIFUL....would you like to join me at my gun club and put those ballistics to the test on the range and see how well you do....  I do a LOT of long range shooting at the range and in the field during woodchuck season.....I would love to shoot with you.  Bob

682060,ch312,2012-03-30 20:43:00,1590,"well, you'll have to wait until august or september when my new slug gun will be in my safe. i hunt quite a bit for pretty much everything out there, so i didn't like having my shotgun dedicated to deer for 2 weeks every season (shoot a few days before the season and season lasts 1 week). therefore, i'm switching to a dedicated slug gun. many reports of 4"" groups at 200 yards from savage and NEF shooters    while i'll probably never shoot a deer past 100 yards, i have zero problems paying for accuracy and range. i'm hoping i'm not going to regret selling my 870 combo that produced those purdy little 2"" center to center groups at 125 yards...  considering i sent a few hundred sabots down that tube, i'm fully aware of how i'd do at those ranges and it's only gonna get better once i get the new gun dialed in.   the fact is, you're arguing when you clearly have very little experience with shooting different slug guns and your statements reflect that. i could care less how often you shoot or what you shoot, we're talking specifically about shooting sabot slugs. go send 3-400 sabots of all the major brands you can find and it'll open your eyes as to what a properly matched combo is capable of. sure it's expensive, but shooting them is a hoot.  i really don't understand why you're so full of doubt when i posted the numbers for you. just because you're not comfortable or capable of doing something it doesn't mean everyone else is the same. while i'm against long range hunting (500 yards+) and can't shoot that good, there's other people out there with machine like precision that can do it all day. just like some can accurately shoot slugs at 200 yards, while others can't."

Mossberg 500 Pros- Dual shell extractors, Tang safeties,  Great combos available, easily disassembled for cleaning, passed US military testing (includes 3000 rounds of 00 buck down the pipe) becoming a standard issue shotgun before the Benelli M4 S90.

681333,Dabluz,2012-03-29 01:21:00,701," Hi Chris.  Lots of good info here.  I also do not recommend a 3 1/2 inch chamber.  3 inches of chamber is lots.  Yes....the 12 gauge is the all purpose shotgun.  A 28, 20 or 16 gauge shotgun shoots pellets just as fast as a 12 gauge and for the same distance and at full choke all will put 75% of their pellets within a 30 inch circle at 30 yards.  The only difference is the number of pellets, and the weight of the gun.  Yes....you have to consider how much you want to pay.  Yes, it's nice to have a fine grade shotgun but you get so worried about scratching it that it can remove some of the fun.  The 870 Remington with the black plastic stock and 3 inch chamber, variable choke tubes is still a good buy.  I forget the model name but every gun store has a few of these in stock.  Yes....these pump action guns will get smoother with age.  I guess they are not as good as they once were but I doubt they are not all that bad either.  Only the people who have had problems speak out.  The 99.9% of those who have never had any problems never gripe about their buy. Yes, you can buy a rifled barrel for the 870 with no problem.  Try out the smooth barrel at the rifle range to see if you really need the rifled barrel.  If you don't like cleaning a shotgun after every outing, buy a single shot 12 gauge.  However, you will not get the variable chokes etc.  If you love to take apart and clean your guns after every outing then you could buy a semi-auto.  For waterfowling, the pump action 12 gauge shotgun is the most popular by far."

I do like 870 but about 10 years ago I bought a norinco 870 knock off with an extra rifled barrel for about 315 out the door I sent the smooth barrel up to epps had the forcing cone opened up and had it laser ported ports are up and back cut I have to say i dont shoot any thing else and I have stoned a wide variety of critters with it. It is a continual winner at turkey shoots and cleans up nice all you got to do is be nice to it it has stayed tight its in 3 inch and probably had a few thousand rounds anyway I have never had a jam the only other things i did to it was put a pistol drop on it and a red dot I did that before it was ported kick is very minimal it was a mule before. all this was done for under 600(total price of gun included) pardon the pun it is a bullet proof gun. Im not a big fan of made in china but I looked at it this way they have been playing around with stuff that goes boom longer then anyone else. I bought it from a shop in hamilton cant remeber the name though you have to buzz the door to get in.  Just my 2 cents  Peter

681153,GbayGiant,2012-03-28 19:18:00,1780,My father has been a collector of guns for 60 years. I have shot ones with value and ones with out.  I know what I am talking about when it comes to a shot gun which will hold up and shoot with the best of them. It's the person who aims the gun and not the value of it. The guy wants to buy his first time shot gun. Not to start a dust collection. You can keep going on about what you know now.

For a first shotgun, you can't beat an 870. First thing is to learn to shoot.....From there, the sky is the limit. I've gone thru some fancy guns, and I always end up with ole trusty when its game time. It also doubles as a push pole, paddle, pry bar or crutch if you need it  I don't even take care of mine. I didn't clean it once last season, and I hunt A LOT more than most, in some nasty conditions. Try doing that with your ""fine"" shotguns. Good luck!!  S."

681178,GbayGiant,2012-03-28 20:16:00,1780, A scattergun is a scattergun. I'll stick to what works tried and true. If a shinny piece is what you like that is fine. I know you could put the best up against the 870 and lose only because the guy pulling the trigger has a shinny piece.   Just because you’ve shot guns for forty years doesn’t mean you can hit anything with them. The scattergun included of course.

681209,jedimaster,2012-03-28 21:08:00,3472,"I never got why 870 guys get so pissy when people complaign about a new 870 express stovepiping a low brass shell. I have personally had a newer 870 express and it was terible. I did my reasearch and apparently the issue is with the new chambers of the new 870 expresses's....Notice I said new 870 express not the 20 year old ones... the new 870 expresses. Not the 15 year old one your papa gave you, not the one you bought in the early 80's...  Anyway the chambers are not polished enough and do have a reported and well documented issue with stove piping lowbrass shells. This is well documented and is not fiction made up.  It can be fixed by polishing the chamber, but that doesn't negate the fact that there IS a problem. I have also heard if you ram the son of bizaatch home hard everytime its very unlikely to jam. However in the field in the heat of the moment people will sometimes ginger it back and thats when they have issues. Now I can tell you this, my winchester 1300 speedpump would eject the shell on its own if you hold the pump with light back pressure. To get the next round in your just pushing forward. Smooth as butter. I have also shot a benelli supernova, and I liked it but the action is not nearly as smooth as the 1300's.  The newest batch of winchester pumps are also very smooth.  As for the auto 5's I think I must be the only one that thinks those things are gawd awfull looking monstrosities. Keep those ugly my mom hates me in the cabinets."
681217,misfish,2012-03-28 21:23:00,29133," When I first started with my rem mag express,I was using the low brass.(cheap) I did have issues with them. Jamming,not ejecting. When I went to the high brass,(which imo,is the better) I have had no issues. My rem 870 express mag is probly 15 yrs old,and shoots like it was new."
681218,Sinker,2012-03-28 21:28:00,8692,"I'm not getting pissy at all, and I'm a hardcore 870 fan. However, you are correct in what you said about them stove piping shells. You can't baby these guns. They are built to take a beating, and meant to be handled that way. Seems like the harder I am on mine, the better it gets. Mine is smooth as silk, and the action can be cycled with two fingers, but I still slam it as hard as I can every time! That's how they're meant to work!  In saying that, I know guys who have had issues with thier 870's. Most of them are super mags, but I have good buddies I hunt with all the time, who have converted from their fancy Beretta's, Benelli's and Franchi's to an 870 for reliability in the field. The guy I hunt with most has since bought 3 870's, and he couldn't stand them when we first started hunting. His Beretta was the first to go, after watching me pound ducks, while his was a single shot, then When his BRAND NEW Franchi did the same thing, he got rid of that, and now shoots an 870 with not a single issue.  I have another buddy who got rid of a Benelli SBE2 after 2 seasons, because it never worked properly from day one. Guess what he shoots now??  The bottom line is you can't go wrong with an 870 as your first gun. If you don't like it, sell it, and try something else. I wouldn't recommend the super mags though, they are the ones that seem to have the problems. The Magnums are fine, and you don't need the 3.5"" shells to kill your quarry. That is a fact!!  If you can find an older used one, that is the way to go. They are bullet proof, and will out live all of us!   S."
681222,jedimaster,2012-03-28 21:32:00,3472,Yup I agree go for an older used on in good condition over a new one and you will likely not be dissapointed. Just keep the shucker in shape or you will be cursing in no time.
681225,Rustic-Fisher,2012-03-28 21:37:00,826,New Winchester pump does look interesting.
681238,jedimaster,2012-03-28 22:04:00,3472,The inertia assited pump action system is amazing once you shoot it you will fall in love. Unless of course you like ramming every shot home as hard as you can. Fastest Pump action shotguns in the world. Made the 1300 Speedpump even better. They are worth a look.
681241,Sinker,2012-03-28 22:08:00,8692,"The winchesters are good too. I can't speak for the new models, but I have a 1300 that is just gathering dust, but its a great gun. I had a 2200 magnum that was worn right out, and still worked OK most of the time, but it did have the occasional hiccup.  I still say ya can't beat an 870 for a first gun, regardless. And Im sure there are many, many hunters that would agree. Easy to accessorize, lots of cheap and effective upgrades, and they will out last any one of us!  It would be nice if the OP would give a little more info on what he intends to do with it most. It makes a difference.  S."
680977,GbayGiant,2012-03-28 13:08:00,1780,870 Express hands down. From price to reliability it is number one. Put it up against the most expensive out there at a range and watch it ink ball targets. From Birds to big game at close range it can't be beat.  Enjoy

Honestly don't make up your mind online or based on someone elses review. Put a hunting jacket on, go to the store, and shoulder all the ones in your price range and the ones just out of reach.

In the field I can get off 4 shots faster than you could get off 4 shots with any 3 round pump gun. Don't forget when hunting in ontario with a shotgun you are limited to 3 rounds max.

681025,ch312,2012-03-28 15:16:00,1590,"another 870 fan here, but i did buy mine about 8 years ago or so. i highly recommend you buy an older 870 that's in great shape (relatively easy to find) as scatterguns simply get better with use. mine has been submerged in mud and water, dropped in sand and dirt, and banged off many trees without a single problem. with an 870 you'll have the most options for aftermarket accessories, easy access to parts, and tons of how-to's online if you're going to mod it.  3"" vs 3 1/2""? considering the price difference is so minimal it makes little sense to choose the 3"" over the 3 1/2"" chamber. weight and size of both guns is the same. patterning your shotgun is huge and finding the load your gun likes is very important so a 3 1/2"" chamber allows many more options. shell A in 3"" may shoot better than shell A in 3 1/2"", but shell B in 3 1/2"" may throw much tighter patterns than the same shell in 3"". best to pay a tiny increase in price now rather than buying a 3"" gun and wishing you had the 3 1/2"".  while the 20 gauge is a great gun and can be used for the same critters as the 12 gauge, the 12 gauge is better in all departments. ammo options, increased range, and significantly more pellets makes the 12 gauge better for most.   lastly, consider purchasing a rifled barrel combo. you'll get a smooth bore with your gun for shot/rifled slugs as well as a fully rifled barrel which permits the use of sabot slugs. with this combo you'll have everything from squirrels to moose covered and your equipment will be capable of taking deer out to 175-200 yards IF you find the sabots your gun likes. mine preferred 2 3/4"" copper solids which would make nice little 3"" outside to outside (center to center = 2""?) groups at 125 yards with a scope off a solid rest."
681038,Billy Bob,2012-03-28 15:58:00,5865," OH WOW, I don't know where to start......lots of mixed up info here....  First if you just purchase a Remington Express 870 it will be chambered for 3"" shells and of course 2.75"" shells.....if you want a  Remington 870 that is chambered for 3.5"" shells you will need to purchase a Remington Express 870 Super Mag.....even the Remington Wingmaster (a very fine gun) is only available in 3"" chambers....all of these firearms will show what shells can be fired on the barrel.  The price difference from a 3.5"" shell to 3"" and 2.75"" shells is significant IMHO......take a box of Federal Blackcloud ammo for duck hunting...Using Cabela's site....3.5"" cost $27.99 per box compared to 3"" at $22.99 per box or 2.75"" at $16.99 per box....that adds up real quick during a long season of waterfowl hunting.....this is why many guys soon after purchasing a 3.5"" chambered shotgun tend to get 3"" shells after the first season with their new shotgun.  The 3.5"" chambered shotgun is much heavier and overall larger to accommodate those heavy hitting magnum shells....  And last but surely not least......NO ONE should EVER use a shotgun to fire at a deer at 175 to 200 yards......that a distance a fine tuned rifle can only make with the right skilled hunter pulling the trigger. Wounded whitetails can go MILES when hit by a poorly placed shot, even with large caliber rifles. A 12 gauge sabot slug sighted zero in at 100 yards drops off 9.9"" at 175 yards and I have no idea how much more it drops at 200 yards....either way that is not a shot I would ever attempt with ANY shotgun. It's just not a response-able shot anyone should make.  Happy Hunting, Bob"

Thought alot about the BPS, probably the nicest gun of that price range in pumps, still heavy in 12ga to carry all day in the uplands.  I was told by a number of serious gun folks to stay away from the current Express and Nitro Mags....lots of issues apparently at gun shops.  Best plan is to think about what you will be doing, if its upland walking, I would look mostly at the weight. I carry a 28ga for grouse hunting in the bush, a please to carry all day vs something in the 8lb plus range.  The nova/super nova are not pretty but they are really nice guns, field strip simply and have not had a hint of a cycling issue thus far."

Not one misfire, jam or otherwise. I've never actually had it jam or misfire. They are great guns. I would suggest the Magnum over the super mag. It seems like the newer super mags are the ones with the reliability issues. I've shot beside guys shooting 3.5"" shells, and my birds are just as dead as thiers are. If you can center your target in the pattern, within range, any size shell will kill. Dont get thinking that a 3.5"" shell is going to kill things further, or deader, because they don't. They ONLY add pattern density, not range. The pellets are still traveling the same speed as a 2 3/4 shell, only there is more of them.  Go in to a gun shop, pick up a shotgun. Look at a target on the wall, close your eyes, and point the gun where you think that target should be. How far off were you? Try another gun and repeat. The gun that puts you closest to the target with your eyes closed is the one you should get.  Fit is far more important than chamber size or anything else. If the gun fits, buy it. They are all pretty reliable.  There are a lot of things to consider.....what do you intend to hunt with it the most?  The Express will rust if you put it away wet, but it will never skip a beat. Why do you think all the police forces have an 870 in all their patrol cars?  I've tried just about every semi auto made at some point or another, and I've seen their owners all let down at some point or another, while I keep banging away on my ugly, rusty, 870.

680913,backbay,2012-03-28 04:34:00,773,"Check out a Maxus, they're reliable. My Remington 1100 has always been good to me, but it was made in the 70s, a good period for Remington. The most important thing imo, though, is to find a gun that feels right to you when you shoulder it."

680924,moose,2012-03-28 10:17:00,266,the 870 express is the all round shot gun that can do everything from changing barrels to chokes and priced reasonably

680927,turtle,2012-03-28 11:02:00,274,"It would depend on what species you hunt.  You can use a 20 gauge for turkey and upland birds as well as deer with a rifled slug barrel. If hunting geese and ducks the 12 gauge is more common.  If you're going for a 3.5 inch I recommend getting one that will handle 2,75 and 3 inch as well. The recoil from a 3.5 inch turkey load is significant.  The pump actions are less expensive relative to semi-autos.  The combos metioned are good value especially if you intend to hunt deer with a shotgun. I recommend not getting a fixed choke, most now are not. Interchangable chokes are more versatile and can be used on more species. I use a Remington 870 in 12 gauge only for turkey, its a reliable low cost shotgun.  The 28 inch barrel on it is a little long for thick woods or tight spots but I don't hunt often with it."
680929,aplumma,2012-03-28 11:18:00,6896,"I am a mossberg fan also but the gun to buy is the one that fits, feels good and is quality made. A trip to the local skeet range might be in order to see what they have as rentals and talk to the people who are shooting.    Art"
680930,grimsbylander,2012-03-28 11:24:00,3016,  X2  The 870 Wingmaster and the 870 Express are essentially the same gun with the exception being the finish. The Wingmaster is a well finished piece that looks like a piece of furniture...beautiful. The Express is a matte finished(somewhat) gun. There used to be quite a price difference. Enough of a diference to invest it in alternate barrels choices if desired.
680933,turtle,2012-03-28 11:38:00,274,"I am a mossberg fan also but the gun to buy is the one that fits, feels good and is quality made. A trip to the local skeet range might be in order to see what they have as rentals and talk to the people who are shooting.  Fit is important. My 870 is a little too long for me in length of pull (distance between trigger and end of butt) and would be more comfortable with a slightly shorter stock.  I havent changed it because I only use it for turkey and take less than 10 shots yearly.  If you plan on shooting alot or hunting geese for example, make sure the fit is right."
680935,BillM,2012-03-28 11:49:00,17367,Can't go wrong with a 870.
680936,12footspringbok,2012-03-28 11:54:00,459,Another vote for the 870 I love mine.  My brother and a buddy both bought the mossberg 3 barrel shotgun combo model 535 i think? Anyways both of them have a barrel that doesn't shoot straight. Take that for what its worth...
680940,Billy Bob,2012-03-28 12:11:00,5865,"Cris, as someone already mentioned it would really depend on what you intend to hunt with it.....with that being said I might steer you away from the 3.5"" chambered shotguns.....maybe....  The 3.5"" chambered shotguns were designed and developed for the SERIOUS waterfowler....and now the serious turkey hunter has also been targeted with these monster shotguns......They are big and HEAVY and not something you would want to carry around hunting upland game with....just too heavy to tote around while walking.....but OK for a duck blind or turkey blind...the other downside of the 3.5"" shotgun is the HIGH price of their shells.......most guys after a while start to use 3"" shells in these monster guns because the cost of the 3.5"" shells, especially when you do a lot of shooting at ducks and geese...here's a link for Cabela's....compare for yourself the costs compared to a 3"" or even a 2.75"" 12 gauge shells to the monster 3.5""......BTW I don't believe any ammo manufacture even makes a 3.5"" Sabot Slug....I may be wrong but I have never seen one....so if deer hunting is high on your list, then a 3"" chambered gun makes even more sense......but if all you are doing is hunting ducks or turkeys from a blind you ""may"" want a 3.5"" chambered shotgun....however, more ducks have fallen to 2.75"" and 3"" shells then the 3.5"" shell.  http://www.cabelas.com/catalog/browse/shooting-ammunition-shotgun-ammunition/_/N-1100191+4294751476/Ne-4294751476?WTz_l=SBC%253BMMcat104792580%3Bcat104691780&WTz_st=GuidedNav&WTz_stype=GNU  A gun that fits to ""YOU"" when you shoulder it is the best shotgun for ""YOU""........with that said the Mossberg's and Remington's are usually the first to come to mind with everyone for a ECONOMICAL shotgun....but there are MANY more out there...  All the newer Remington's are now built on the cheap compared to 10 years ago or so......the Remington 870 Express is a cheap version of the Remington Wingmaster that is a very fine firearm....and now they even figured out how to make the Express even cheaper (for them) by not blueing the metal parts (barrel, receiver, etc...) but rather parkerizing it and I now hear guys in the swamps complaining the gun is starting to rust on the first or second time out duck hunting....this is not a good start for a new shotgun.  If you can find a BLUED Shotgun, even if it cost a bit more, buy it....it will serve you better in the long run.  You didn't mention how much you want to spend but here in the USA the cheaper Remingtons and Mossberg pumps can be had for around $200 new...the finer models of these same guns can be almost double that amount.  A good shape used but cared for shotgun is what I would recommend if you have a limited budget, as you have lots of time to find on right now....you will get more for you ""bang"" with a fine used shotgun then a cheap new one.  Good Luck and let us know what you find, Bob"
680942,backbay,2012-03-28 12:20:00,773,"Agreed on the 870 if you want a pump. Any Model 12 fans out there? That was my first 12 gauge, and I wish I still had it today. I think it may have found its way to my brother's gun room in Ft McMurray. hmm........"
680946,BillM,2012-03-28 12:23:00,17367,"Agree with BB here, no reason for a 3.5 gun unless you're popping geese from 40-50yrds..   A 3in setup will be fine for rabbits, grouse etc..  If you want deer then a slug barrel is an easy addition..   My oldmans Browning Auto-5 with a Hastings slug barrel has dropped more deer then I care to remember.  (This is a 2 and 3/4 gun)"
680948,NAW,2012-03-28 12:29:00,4022,"http://www.lebaron.ca/pdffiles/web_spec/rem_870expresstrio_web.pdf  Check this out.  Remingtons answer to the Mosberg 3 barrel package.  Walk in only at Lebaron.  Me, and a buddy both bought one.  The only crappy thing is, these guns will rust if not taken care of.  Bullet proof though."
680959,Rustic-Fisher,2012-03-28 12:45:00,826,"Approach the 870 express with caution as in the past few years there have been some quality concerns. Stay away from the nitro all together. Are you a left or right shooter? BPS ( browning) makes an ambidextrous bottom eject shotgun comparable to a wingmaster. Go try them and swing them all. In my opinion the best shotgun is an older Remington WIngmaster, they just don't build them like they used to period. Down sides are it will likely have fixed chokes. This can be remedied . Then with the left over $$ from buying an older gun , go pick up a dedicated slug gun like the express. Canadian gun nutz is the site to look on for this type of info. good luck R"
680962,35Wailin,2012-03-28 12:50:00,59,"  I have an 870 Express that I bought new in 1987.  The sequence goes like this: pump the action, pull trigger, bang, repeat until out of ammo.  I have a 3 inch chamber on mine and I would say that unless you are doing some serious goose hunting or maybe turkeys (never hunted turkeys, so I don't know the necessity for 3.5""), you don't need the 3.5"" chamber.  I have been doing well for geese the last two seasons with 3"" steel shot which doesn't beat my shoulder like a 3.5"" would.  I would also suggest that unless you need to shoot 3.5"" frequently, if you need a little more extra killing power, switch over to a 3"" shell shooting something like bismuth or heavy-shot (non-steel, denser than lead alternatives).  I have heard and seen reports with some of the 3.5"" shotguns being less than reliable with the longer shells.  If a feed/ejection malfunction costs you game in the bag, then the extra expense of the heavier than steel shells start to become less expensive.  I have fired tens of thousands of rounds through my 870, both 2 3/4 and 3"", and the only malfunctions I have had were related to reloads. I had a few feed issues last season with factory loads, but I gave it a good cleaning under the shell latches in the receiver.  Problem solved.  I have had a few semis over the years, but I keep going back to the pump for reliability."
680968,NAW,2012-03-28 13:01:00,4022," Nothing worse then gettin up early, getting to the blind.  Ducks are dive bombing you, and the first shot, you blow a gas seal.  Day over.  Well, unless you want to use your Semi as a single shot.  This has happened to me with my old 1100 once."
680969,Billy Bob,2012-03-28 13:01:00,5865," Well, that's got to be a FIRST........"
680972,Billy Bob,2012-03-28 13:04:00,5865, RARE but I guess it happens unless you have the BEST Autoloader out there in the duck blind with you....a old trusty Browning Auto-5 that has no gas seals to fail.....
