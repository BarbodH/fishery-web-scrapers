682047,skinny,2012-03-30 20:03:00,442,I'm going to look at a 95 Toyota.If it's as good as I'm told I will purchase it . I'm curious as to the red book value of such a suv. If I do buy it I will be looking to put a trip permimt on  it and I'm pretty sure you must pay taxes right then based on red book or purchase price which ever is greater
