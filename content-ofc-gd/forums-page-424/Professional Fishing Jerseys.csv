I found some stuff on the web but it seems you would need permission from any company names or decals you put on the shirt. Even better, anyone have one they want to sell? lolololol....no seriously!"

You can go into places that male them and get one made for yourself. Usually you need companys permission to add logos. Bass clubs are a good source for these shirts as they usually have an affiliation with groups and organizations that have their own branded shirts."
