681695,stainer,2012-03-29 21:03:00,13,"I'd like to formally introduce myself to the forum. Although I've been a lurker and browsing the threads for a while now, I'll be posting more often.  I'm an avid angler (of all species), canoeist, outdoorsman who's fished all over this lovely province of ours and I've even worked for the MNR (some of you - don't hold it against me!). Anyways, I figured I'd say hi and if anyone ever needs an extra in the boat, don't hesitate to PM me and I'll put out the call when I need an extra in mine. I might even try my luck this weekend in the Haliburton area for some ice out trout.  Cheers, - Stainer"

681749,stainer,2012-03-29 22:42:00,13," Davey, Thanks for the kind wishes. As for the MNR, I didn't make regulations or policies, so at least I have that going for me!"
