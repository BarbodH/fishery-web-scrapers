681753,MCTFisher9120,2012-03-29 22:55:00,3761, The government doesn't know how to do math...everybody knows that
681756,MCTFisher9120,2012-03-29 23:17:00,3761,"Touchy thread again but I agree with Bob because he is right. The government system is twisted enough, we pay too much and you all know it. It's a excuse to bill a dozen people because they could of just let it go...They learned they felt there jaws drop and I couldn't imaging the feeling they felt out there. Must of been scary but weeks later they get hit with a $200 bill...around tax time too no figure.  I'm not a long time worker but all of you that have been working for year know or can imaging how much money is taken from us each pay each year each purchase. The township has money the government has the money i don't think a extra 2 grand is going to do much but pay for the food at the next 5 meetings right.  Make em pay is the theme here it seems..do you really think the money is going where you think it is. I can't reply again to the comments so don't wait for furious responses because its foolish to defend the government. A lie there world is to us.  They made the mistake and I'm sure there were many hugs from family and laugh's from friends about the event. Let me tell you, the day after being saved or assisted by crucial services and I get a bill from the the dink that sits in his office and has nothing to do with the outdoor world I might just go nuts.  Let the spring begin!  MTBF"
681966,fishhunter,2012-03-30 15:28:00,604,Well I for one would not have a problem paying $200 to live and fish another day. What is $200 when it comes to life. I pay lots of taxes and not a lover of it but paying $200 for a ride of life how can you go wrong.
681967,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-30 15:30:00,0,it's funny because this thread gives perspective on which ofc'ers will be getting rescued some day!
681975,lookinforwalleye,2012-03-30 16:11:00,4399,The guy that has been rescued numerous times should pay the whole tab perhaps that will help that little light bulb that should be going on!!! Assuming that light bulb didn`t burn out years ago!
682017,Oggie,2012-03-30 18:22:00,588,"I'm sure this has been said but..... don't throw stones if you live in a glass house.  How would you like a bill for rescue after you've toured the ditch in a snow storm because of excessive speed?  How about billing the impaired driver for the cost of the Ride Programs we need to setup each weekend?  If they rescue you in a summer storm on Simcoe after there's been numerous weather warnings issued, should you be billed? ETC.  The government at all levels is looking to off load expenses. I know $200 doesn't come close to the cost but the precedent is dangerous.  It's a slippery slope and we all know the Municipalities around Simcoe are for the most part not supporters of the ice fishing crowd. Is this not another way to discourage ice fishing?  Parking tickets have done it for many.  Dan O."
682018,davey buoy,2012-03-30 18:27:00,5505," I don't know about discouraging ice fishing,but if there is little to no ice,AND warnings were given,What do you think should of been done?."
682019,capt bruce,2012-03-30 18:32:00,820," Doc you never fail to surprise me .. Of all the posters I would have thought you would see this as what it is ""double Taxing"" .. Billy Im withyou on this one .. NO one has said anything about the 100's plus who went out that day .. Was not just 26 guys on Simcoe that weekend , if you gonna charge people with all those others out there who MUST OF HAD THE RESCUE guys on stand by , they all put themselves at risk , yet beyond a sign or two that had been there ALL WINTER ,no one stopped them ..  It is more often from pride than from ignorance that we are so obstinately opposed to current opinions; we find the first places taken, and we do not want to be the last. -Francois De La Rochefoucauld, moralist (1613-1680)  think you just want to go against what you know is right , just to be Different .. or maybe you have changed your values ??? .. Let them go and take their moneys and than fine/tax them when it went wrong .. DUHHHHH !!!!!! Guess you never took a chance in your life when the warning is ALLWAYS THERE , those signs where not put up that day THEY WERE THERE ALL WINTER >> SO NO ONE SHOULD HAVE EVER BEEN OUT ON THE ICE ON SIMCOE THIS YEAR >>"
682020,Twocoda,2012-03-30 18:32:00,4130, do they not issue fines for people that drive down closed roads during those snow events....and your insurance is null and void should you have an accident on a closed road ? i said it before and ill say it again....SOME people require others to make decisions for them...THEY GOT OFF EASY!!!!
682022,lookinforwalleye,2012-03-30 18:33:00,4399," Wouldn`t be speeding in a snow storm,wouldn`t be on the Simcoe when weather warnings are present,and what ever you want to do to a convicted impaired driver is alright by me!"

682307,Oggie,2012-03-31 18:43:00,588,"If they chose to venture on to the ice knowing it was unsafe and with warning then fine them.  I heard the ice was 8"" thick and the wind came up very quickly. I wasn't there but I see some of you guys are locals and you felt it was totally unsafe then I'd respect that and say they get what they deserve.  I do wish the OPP would be a little more judicious in their warnings though. In this case it was obviously warranted but the OPP never stop issuing unsafe ice warnings even when the ice is safe on a good year. You can't constantly cry WOLF!  I know it would cut the OPP's workload if nobody ice fished. Then everybody is safe!  I always wonder if it's fellow ice fishermen that say hang these guys up by the you-know-whats.  It's easy to judge if you don't parttake of the sport. I think they should fine snowmobilers that require a rescue.... oh wait a minute I don't snowmobile. Doesn't affect me.  Dan O."
682369,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-31 21:47:00,0," well, i think it's foolish for ANYONE to be on the ice when the conditions don't warrant it.  those 100's of people are all foolish and fortunate that they didn't end up in the same boat as the ice flow trollers."

681572,mike rousseau,2012-03-29 16:23:00,4661,  i mean if my fishing accident i may encounter is truly unforeseen...  by making these people pay...it will make it easier and easier for the government to pass judgment saying you were not using good judgment... then maybe some day all rescues in canada will have a hefty price tag attached to it...
681576,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-29 16:27:00,0,if an accident is truly unforeseen i don't expect people to pay.  this was far from unforeseen.
681577,richyb,2012-03-29 16:27:00,774,They are claiming $200/hr for the air boat and $100/hr for each volunteer firefighter. I doubt that boat is burning that much fuel and I know for a fact the firemen do not earn that amount of money. I thought they were just wanting to recover the cost?
681580,Dara,2012-03-29 16:29:00,3052,"  To you it was unforeseen  The first guy out there didn't think of it...the second didn't either...the ones after that said, hmm,,,they are out there, it must be safe enough.   How can you say that many people were wrong if it was so easily foreseen"
681583,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-29 16:35:00,0,"to me, it was completely foreseen.  standing on the ice after unseasonably mild weather near open water on a windy day?  hahaha... if you think that's logical then it's your funeral.  just don't expect me to pay for it."
681584,Dara,2012-03-29 16:37:00,3052,  There was no funeral...they got rescued
681585,Dara,2012-03-29 16:39:00,3052,  And look where it happened. This is the first year in a long time that we haven't seen a picture of a sunken parking lot coming from that bunch
681587,Dan668,2012-03-29 16:40:00,1120,"Definitely foreseeable. Put all the factors together. I wasn't on simcoe once cause of the crappy conditions.  The one guy,  was his third time being rescued. Nuff said, should have to pay."
681594,Twocoda,2012-03-29 17:02:00,4130, for the last two years we do....125 bucks  if they renamed the fine to Stupidity then im sure we would all sit back and chuckle at the people that got the fines....furthermore they should start a club of fined participants  BB i see your point for sure....but SOMETIMES people need to be protected from themselves and this could be a deterring factor for those that arent capable of thinking properly

WHAT ABOUT THEM ????? But this is comeing from a guy who one time put my car thru the ice on the bog late one year , lucky it was the bog 10 feet from shore , water only came up to the doors , climbed out windows , a winch and half an hour ,we were home free, stupid maybe but than again fished with over 100 guys in sight that day  ... Stuff happens thats why we have a rescue squad, isnt it ??? Stop people from going out if its so unsafe and the township sure doesnt refuse the tax dollars that come from the timmies etc. in the area that the ice fishers go to , without icefishing that area in the winter would be dead , cant let people go out , even advertise that great winter get aways the area offers and than double tax the guys who YOU LET GO THERE and now things happen .. BAN ICEFISHING ON SIMCOE than you never have to worry about something like this .. Damn the gas stations in the area with the taxes they pay from silly people who fill up their tanks to get home more than pay for this ...

681715,Twocoda,2012-03-29 21:40:00,4130,why is it when people see red flags flying in the summer time on any given great lakes beach they know not to go into the water because of undertow...does the government need to make a new DIFFERENT COLOUR flag for ice fishers when the ice isnt safe    maybe they can get the MNR to post them for those that cant understand verbal warnings  .....i do think restructuring the fines is in order though...if they fined each person the same value of their equipment they have with them it would seperate the novice to the experienced...hence educating the novice to the dangers and punishing the experienced for acting stupid....
681717,davey buoy,2012-03-29 21:47:00,5505," I like the idea of one free pass,if/only(you weren't aware) the waters or lakes were deemed unsafe and well warned in advanced. We all take chances from time to time but we have to find ways of making ourselves aware of what the day a head could be."

681494,BillM,2012-03-29 14:10:00,17367, So the main lake basin not being frozen and people being 100yrds away from open water had nothing to do with it?  It was all the winds fault?
681503,Dara,2012-03-29 14:24:00,3052,"So really...the township has passed a law against stupid?  Come on people...how much are we going to let government get away with.  All of our tax dollars paid for that rescue. This is just double billing.  If there is no crime, there is no fine."
681513,richyb,2012-03-29 14:46:00,774,"  Sure there were SOME people being idiots that close to the open water but it broke off almost a KM from the open water. I hope that you werent on simcoe where you took your pic for that funny fishing pic contest. On another site a guy was Fishing on 2"" of ice at the first of the year and the next day the ice was gone and he is praised a fishing god. Ironically he was one of the first to call these people stupid that were on 5 inches or more. I have seen quite a few posts of people ice fishing with open water in the background. If  there was no wind that day there would not have been a rescue. OR if they had enough common sense to stay home because of the WIND there wouldnt have been a rescue either ... Im just tired of hearing everyone saying that there was warnings all winter about the ice so nobody should have been out there. ICE IS NEVER SAFE and you have to use your own judgement as to what is safe conditions or not."
681524,BillM,2012-03-29 14:55:00,17367, I fished Simcoe this year maybe 3-4 times... Ice was way to dicey in a lot of places for me to bother.  That pic was actually from the Muskokas...  Lots of ice up there this year (In certain places)
681526,mike rousseau,2012-03-29 15:08:00,4661,so whats next...   your kid breaks his leg skateboarding... now you pay the bill... skateboarding is dangerous...  you break your arm downhill skiing... now you pay the bill... skiing is dangerous...  you get t boned at an intersection by a drunk driver...now you pay the bill...driving is dangerous...  your house burns down cause of a grease fire...now you pay the fire dept bill... deep frying is dangerous...    we all do things in life that are considered dangerous to some extent... think about what something like this could start...this is the opening the government needs to start making us pay for all the services our taxes are supposed to pay for...  people can smoke cigarets for 50 years and then our taxes pay for the health care they require... now that is STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and there are warnings on the package that state that smoking causes cancer and other health issues... but every time a lifetime smoker goes to the hospital..the cost isnt splattered all over the news...and his bills get paid by the taxes we pay...   i tried to avoid this one but i had to say my 2 cents...
681531,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-29 15:26:00,0,"mike,  you miss the fact that search and rescue employees risk THEIR lives to rescue these idiots.  it's a stupid and selfish choice to go on unsafe ice, putting yourself and OTHERS at risk, while also costing a LOT of money.  and i don't disagree with the smokers thing.  i think smokers should pay EVEN MORE tax on their death sticks."
681532,richyb,2012-03-29 15:27:00,774,"  Not really a fine, just a helicopter ride. A tax payer has to pay for a ride in an ambulance so why not a helicopter or an air boat?"

681542,ecmilley,2012-03-29 15:50:00,2163,"since everyone wants a user pay system in  place, i guess i should expect a check for the taxeds i paid that purchased the helo's boats trucks and training and provided there paycheques as well? this is what we pay for and if the people were stupid to bad one day it may be you that needs rescuing then you'll be whining about it on OFC........."
681546,Dara,2012-03-29 15:55:00,3052,  and you said it...EMPLOYEE...they get paid to do it  and the Helicopter ride is crap too...we shouldn't have to pay for an ambulance ride...next think you know we will have to pay for eye exams
681547,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-29 15:56:00,0," i think in order for this analogy to be accurate you'd have to be doing something extremely selfish and dangerous to ignite the fire....  such as burning garbage in the yard on a windy day and it sets the house on fire...  in which case, yes, i'd also think they should pay for the fire suppression costs..."
681548,Dara,2012-03-29 15:57:00,3052,What about the OPP guys that lost the boat off the trailer last year in Barrie...that was stupid...did they have to pay for the boat
681549,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-29 15:57:00,0, most search and rescue are volunteers are they not?  our local search and rescue is and they work on a very specific budget.
681550,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-29 15:58:00,0,p.s.  i do have to pay for my eye exams. hahahaha
681552,Dara,2012-03-29 16:00:00,3052,"  Totally legal if you have a burning permit, which you pay for  and you pay for a fishing license as well so why can't you go fishing  What if you slip on a rock in the rapids and need rescue"
681554,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-29 16:01:00,0,"it is my understanding of our bylaws that burning is supposed to be done during specific hours of the day (morning and night), and not in dry or windy conditions.  same in the bush.  i know a man who was charged the cost of fire suppression by the mnr for starting a brush fire.  i say he deserved it."
681556,Dara,2012-03-29 16:02:00,3052,"  I know...but you never did till they decided that it was going to cost extra, but taxes didn't go down...pretty soon you will pay for yearly medical exams"

681562,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-29 16:08:00,0, is that where their fees go?  they don't get my money anymore given that they haven't done anything about the crown land access rights issue... that's a different can of worms though!
681563,Dara,2012-03-29 16:12:00,3052,  Its all the same can of worms...government control of us and our money.  You ever see Mcguinty change his mind on anything....cept no new taxes
681565,crappieperchhunter,2012-03-29 16:13:00,2582, Yep X2  Slippery slippery slope.
681567,mike rousseau,2012-03-29 16:14:00,4661,   well... i think you should pack your bags and move to another country... cause you dont sound very canadian to me...  we are a country that sticks together and pays taxes to provide services for people that otherwise may not be able to afford them... no matter what decisions they make in life canadians should know they have help...without a bill waiting for them in the end... peoples circumstances can change...one day your on top and dont need the governments help...the next you realize how happy you are that your government has your back...and the taxes you and others in your community paid have your back...  the world is a messed up place but i like the fact that the people making the big bucks and paying lots of tax dollars are helping to support the poor when they need it...  it sucks that some feel this is a license to be stupid and leech off of the system... but i dont want to have to pay for a rescue down the road that was truly unforeseen...
681568,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-29 16:17:00,0," that begs the question as to whether what happened to them was unforeseen...   there's a difference between getting caught in an unfortunate circumstance and putting yourself in one.  if that makes me ""un-canadian"" then so be it.  i'm moving to Logic-istan."

Be very very carefull what you do from now on
681437,Harrison,2012-03-29 12:26:00,2202,$200 bucks each.  Seems low to me..  My linkhttp://www.thestar.com/news/article/1153484--anglers-rescued-from-lake-simcoe-ice-floe-ordered-to-pay-200-each
681443,Billy Bob,2012-03-29 12:29:00,5865,Seems STUDID IMHO
681447,BillM,2012-03-29 12:33:00,17367,$200 to save your life?  Sounds cheap to me.  Live and learn I guess.
681450,Rod Caster,2012-03-29 12:34:00,5784,"200 is the hourly cost of a small excavator and a triax, not helicopters and rescue boats! Where the heck did they come up with 200"
681454,Harrison,2012-03-29 12:42:00,2202,"Not sure that would even cover wages of the call in emergency staff.  PS. mods it appears there was two threads posted about this at the exact same time, if it is an issue feel free to pull this one if you like."
681455,Billy Bob,2012-03-29 12:42:00,5865," Here I go again.....  I agree with you....LOL it is cheap if you look at it that way........However, that is why we pay taxes.....this may be the first time these folks finally got some service from their government and BAM they are going to be double charged.....Now don't get me wrong.....I am not promoting dangerous things.....but as a firefighter for over 35 years we have many times rescued people from stupid acts.....but we never send them a bill because they have been supporting us for all the years prior to this service....I don't think any of them went out on the ice to get rescued....  A act like this could snowball......what about a nut case you have to arrest....maybe a huge confrontation with police and fire....do you know not only throw him in jail but also fine his family assets to pay for the police and or fire services needed at the scene."
681457,BillM,2012-03-29 12:45:00,17367,"BB, I really think it's the township that doesn't want to pick up the tab..  That's probably the only reason they are getting charged."
681458,woodenboater,2012-03-29 12:49:00,2277,I think extenuating circumstances such as unsafe ice warnings tipped it this way and I have no problems with it in this particular situation. There are some things that happen and some things that shouldn't happen. This *shouldn't* have happened.
681459,Harrison,2012-03-29 12:49:00,2202,What if it was one person.  Do you think they would get charged the rescue fee?
681460,Billy Bob,2012-03-29 12:50:00,5865, But weren't all those services already in place and paid for ? ? ?  This is or should be the # 1 reason we have a government in place.....we waste a lot of money on many undesirables everyday and no bats a eye......but now these tax paying folks are going to get billed for a service that they have supported through all the taxes they have already paid and will continue to pay.....just doesn't seem right to me.
681461,BillM,2012-03-29 12:51:00,17367, Problem is the people that were rescued aren't paying taxes in this township...   It's not very big...  and to get slapped with a huge bill like this?    I can see their point.  But I also see your point as well.  Bottom line is those people shouldn't have been out on the ice in the first place..
681465,Billy Bob,2012-03-29 13:03:00,5865, How about the person from across the country that causes a accident on the 401 and emergency services are needed.....do you see where this is heading...it's a very slippery slope...a can of worms that should not be opened....
681467,Grimace,2012-03-29 13:07:00,2020,I often disagree with Bob but in my opinion he is 'bang on' here.
681469,Harrison,2012-03-29 13:10:00,2202, I am still torn.  You should be accountable if you put yourself is a dangerous situation and have been warned.  Your the one flipping the coin IMO.  But Billy does make some good points.  Where do you draw the line? Extreme skiers? Rock Climbers? Guys fishing in a Canoe in February at the nuke plant outflow in 4 fters?
681471,mike rousseau,2012-03-29 13:10:00,4661,  i agree they should not have been out there...  but at the same time there are lots of un educated anglers out there... there are still guys here that dont know the walleye limit changed like 4-5 years ago... or that pike have a closed season now...  we dont all access the resources available to us... i dont listen to the radio or read the newspaper... and if it wasnt for ofc i wouldnt here most of the warnings/news...   considering this happens from time to time... id say first rescue is free because we do pay taxes for these services... but it goes on your record... after that make em pay...and make em pay big.... like that guy who said it was his third time being rescued... that means hes put rescuers lives at risk 3 times now and hasnt learned from it...   people get into jams here and there... thats life...   i dunno...  ive never gone through the ice so its hard to say... id rather play it safe and get my tackle ready for spring and make carp bait...
681472,Billy Bob,2012-03-29 13:11:00,5865,My last response (to both threads here)......I just can't believe how fast fellow anglers here are so quick to rip into their comrades instead of standing besides them when their support is needed the most....it could easily been anyone of us among that group that need help from our paid government emergency services.  Bob
681474,grimsbylander,2012-03-29 13:12:00,3016,I think the $200 is only meant as a deterrent as it no way comes close to covering rescue dollars. The fine for not wearing a seatbelt is not equivilent to the cost of a life either. Just a guess though.
681475,BillM,2012-03-29 13:15:00,17367," There was no reason for them to be out on the ice... Warm temps, 80km/h winds for 3 days beforehand...  Warnings on the TV, radio...  There's a reason why no one from OFC was out there, we know better.  Idiots like these give everyone else a bad name."
681477,Harrison,2012-03-29 13:20:00,2202,Hey maybe the $200 bucks will deter the one wizard from going for a swim for the 4th time.... probably not.
681482,woodenboater,2012-03-29 13:36:00,2277,"my last word (ha ha)  The fire dept report stated  ""...that there was not evidence of good judgment being used by the fishermen when they went out on the ice...""    Personally, that's all I need to know. Also from the same story, and for those who may not have actually read it...  ""The township adopted a fees and charges bylaw two years ago to deter people from taking unnecessary risks on the lake, but it had never been enforced."" Perhaps things will change next season if an example has been set and if not, they shouldn't whinge when the get a bill."
681484,Hoppy,2012-03-29 13:40:00,95,I worry about this. To me it's like the boy who cried wolf story. The man doesn't want us on the ice at all. Why would we heed the unsafe ice warnings when they are constant. If something goes wrong on the ice they can always blame the anglers because there are constant unsafe ice warnings. I have seen barrie police officers on local tv (ctv barrie) tell us there is no such thing as safe ice and no one should ever ice fish. Ice conditions reporting is spotty and inaccurate therefore should not be the benchmark that these anglers are judged by.
681485,Grimace,2012-03-29 13:47:00,2020,I think they were Incredibally stupid to be out on the ice.  This whole thing makes my blood boil but to make them pay for something that has been paid for 10 times over by some of the highest taxed people on the planet (us) is silly.   It's not like they pulled a Peter MacKay who got the search and rescue team to pick him up on a fly in fishing trip because he wanted to bask in his cultural elitism.  Let's make HIM pay first and then we can go after these other dummies.
681486,Grimace,2012-03-29 13:48:00,2020, Interesting point.
681487,richyb,2012-03-29 13:49:00,774,"People were sitting at home on their computers all winter long saying stay off the ice. The news shows where a creek goes into the lake and says "" stay off the ice""  They had no clue what they were talking about without actually going out there on the ice to find out. I was fishing where it broke off a couple days before that and the ice was alright. I was on 5"" of ice and there were lots of people around. I actually woke up that morning to go out but said ""SCREW- THAT"" , the wind was blowing hard and straight up the bay and it would be stupid to be out there because you could tell that it could break off and float away. It was all the wind it wasnt the ice. Even on those little ice thickness cards they tell you that safe ice for walking is 4"" clear ice. Im related to one guy that got rescued and know quite a few others and they were STUPID for being out there with that WIND not because of the ice thickness.  I bet every ice fisherman in here has fished on ice that was thinner than the ice they were on just without the crazy wind."
681489,Rob,2012-03-29 13:55:00,467,"If you start to charge people for rescue operations, you will now run the risk of people trying to rescue themselves to avoid paying for it. Personally, I feel that 200 bucks is reasonable considering the one guys had been rescued 3 times. He has not learned his lesson, and THAT is why they are being charged. If it was me, I would go and thank them, donate thé $200 and apologize for my poor judgement. But hey, that is just me."
