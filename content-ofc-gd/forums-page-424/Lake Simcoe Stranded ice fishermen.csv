681692,Terry,2012-03-29 20:56:00,14456,"again every day this icefishing season on simcoe people were reporting the ice onsafe so again does that mean no one should have been on simcoe all year and if they were on simcoe anytime during the season they were morons... the only difference that day was the wind..and if there was no wind they would not have a problem...... I don't have a problem with them being charged, but I think most activities that have some danger should be charged for rescue... so by your logic   No but what about driving in the fog with your eyes closed at 200 mph, and not pay for the rescue you are saying I can break the law and speed as long as I keep my eyes open..(the fishermen did not break any laws)  again hut rental operators had huts out when unsafe ice reports were being made cops , who by the way have less expertize on ice conditions then the average fisherman  so we have it right you are saying every time anyone reports unsafe ice, people should say off it.... well maybe if we have an expert do the reports..."
681696,COUNTRYBOY,2012-03-29 21:05:00,130, YEY...IF OUTDOOR ADVENTURES OF SORT DIDN'T HAVE SOME SORT OF RISK...IT WOULDN'T BE NEARLY AS FUN
681699,Jer,2012-03-29 21:08:00,1426,   Better stop all those baby bonus cheques going to all those teen moms.  Doesn't sound very NDP of you.
681707,jedimaster,2012-03-29 21:20:00,3472,  rofl that's the best one I read all week.....um maybe a tie with the santa float one and the scrooge coin pool.
682021,Oggie,2012-03-30 18:33:00,588, That sums it up for me! Dan O.
681436,chuckymcd,2012-03-29 12:26:00,144,"In case anyone is interested I heard on the radio this morning that they are going to charge the stranded people the $5,000.00 that it cost for the rescue effort.  They mentioned something about community service as well, maybe in lieu of the fine."
681438,Billy Bob,2012-03-29 12:28:00,5865,STUPID IMHO
681441,BillM,2012-03-29 12:28:00,17367,I didn't think the township was going to pick up the tab for that...
681444,NAW,2012-03-29 12:30:00,4022,"I herd on the radio this morning, that some of the anglers are planning a baseball tourny, and the money raised will go to against the charges.  That's their form of comunity service.  I'm not sure I agree with that, but if that's how they want to raise money to pay their bills, then go for it.  But I don't consider a baseball tourny ""comunity service"", IMO."
681446,Rod Caster,2012-03-29 12:32:00,5784,They should organize the santa parade instead... And ride the floats
681448,chuckymcd,2012-03-29 12:34:00,144,"I will have to agree with you NAW, A baseball tourny is not community service. if they did that to raise money for a charity or something instead of paying the fines with it, then maybe I would be for it."
681449,NAW,2012-03-29 12:34:00,4022,  Good one Chad!
681456,spinnerbaitking,2012-03-29 12:44:00,1622,"They are getting off easy, x it by 10 maybe & community service is a joke unless it has changed lol Tight Lines SBK"
681462,woodenboater,2012-03-29 12:53:00,2277,"A fundraising baseball tourney ? So someone else is paying their fines basically ? what a fail. Community service should be manual labour, cleaning up garbage at boat launches for the season, that kinda thing. Having fun hitting balls doesn't count."
681464,Billy Bob,2012-03-29 13:01:00,5865, You have real criminals in lock up that should be doing this....not law abiding tax paying citizens.
681466,woodenboater,2012-03-29 13:06:00,2277,"They're not charged/ convicted of a crime so it's community hours. I've always understood those hours to be doing something to benefit the community and a baseball fundraiser (to help pay their fines no less) doesn't count imo. Their community service hours should be something that allows them to reflect on why they're doing such hours. Baseball is play and then get drunk and laugh at the process. I also don't believe for one second that they'll take anything away from their experience, well hopefully a few will."
681470,Billy Bob,2012-03-29 13:10:00,5865,My last response (to both threads here)......I just can't believe how fast fellow anglers here are so quick to rip into their comrades instead of standing besides them when their support is needed the most....it could easily been anyone of us among that group that need help from our paid government emergency services.  Bob
681478,jedimaster,2012-03-29 13:25:00,3472,"To be honest I think if anyone by there own stupidity endagers lives and costs huge bucks in rescue efforts, that they should be asked to do community service. Maybe clean up the docks or collect die off, or volunteer at a soup kitchen or something. Fines, yah maybe, if you don't want to lend a hand helping out."
681481,richyb,2012-03-29 13:36:00,774,Ofcourse they would do something with baseball. Borelli ( the guy thats been rescued 3 times) runs the orillia mens slow pitch. They should have to pay the fine and that money be put back into cleaning up boat launches and beaches. Having fun playing baseball isnt much of a punishment is it ?
681483,Rod Caster,2012-03-29 13:39:00,5784," Comrads? Have you read some of the threads? Not everyone here likes each other just because we have a common interest. It's just a common interest we are here to discuss. The comradary is formed outside of this site, on the lake, imo... trust me what I say that I don't like every fisherman out there and I won't blindly support them  Anyway, at this moment, i agree with you, Bob, unless they were charged under the Criminal Code they should not pay. The county of Simcoe is notoriously cheap and penalizing. It doesn't suprise me that they wanted some kind of retribution. $200 is peanuts, and I'm glad they weren't billed for the entire rescue... the precedence that would set would be scary."
681501,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-29 14:23:00,0,good.. i don't want intelligent peoples taxes to pay for morons actions.
681505,jedimaster,2012-03-29 14:31:00,3472, The world is coming to an end.... I may actually agree with you. cough cough choke choke
681508,bow slayer,2012-03-29 14:39:00,1074,"Yesterday 13 Wisconsin anglers were rescused from the ice from the Manitoba side of Lake of the Woods after being warned about unsafe conditions. Today one of the rescuers wants the group to pay their cost,i agree stupid people must start paying for their misadventures.

681599,registerfly,2012-03-29 17:16:00,198," could have but it wasn't any of us, just them, and one of them for a 3rd time. With the weather we've had this past winter and repeated warnings, enough said. NO SYMPATHY."
681668,COUNTRYBOY,2012-03-29 20:11:00,130,  I'M WITH YOU ON THAT BOB...I DON'T THINK ONE OF THEM GUYS PLANNED ON GETTING RESCUED THAT DAY BUT I'M SURE THEY WERE GLAD THEY WERE THERE TO RESCUE THEM. COMMON SENCE...SOME HAVE IT AND OTHERS DON'T...DOSEN'T MEAN THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE RESCUED...AS FAR AS PAYING THE TAB...I THINK THEY COULD MAKE A DONATION TO SOMETHING THAT COULD BENIFIT OTHERS....AND YA BOB....ALL THE LOVE ON THIS SITE BRINGS A TEAR TO MY EYE ...
681674,Terry,2012-03-29 20:29:00,14456,"well I think they will have to give us a pay scale for rescue, just so we know..so we can decide if it is worth the risk before we do things..  ice fishing....200 a rescue downhill skiing ..sure you know people get hurt and have to be rescued  snowmobiling yup every year rescuers have to go into the bush and rescue them so atving too hunting yup hiking oh yeah far more people rescued the icefishing paintballing sure  camping could be bungee jumping....no that seems perfectly safe..so that should be a free rescue..LOL  now driving in the fog...every foggy day people get rescued from their cars...bill them  rain snow ice ..not safe bill them    and just for the record, every day this icefish season, such as it was, the ice on simcoe was reported unsafe... so how could businesses have huts out if it was deemed unsafe and if it is deemed unsafe should there be a law that makes it illegal to go on the ice....   so what was my point  I don't know I rambled so much I forgot  LOL  if icefishing rescue is billed then almost all rescues should be billed....is driving in the fog any safer then fishing on the ice..."
681682,jedimaster,2012-03-29 20:38:00,3472, No but what about driving in the fog with your eyes closed at 200 mph or skiing on a closed hill due to avalanche warnings or hiking in forest when there is a forest fire in the area  When you're told not to do something and you do it anyway and you as a grown adult should know better its no longer a freak act of nature... its your own fault... and as such you should be held accountable. If that means you foot the bill for your own stupidity so be it.  JHMO
