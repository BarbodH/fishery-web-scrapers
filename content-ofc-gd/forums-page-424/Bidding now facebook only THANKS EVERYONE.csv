Leah and mines Temagami offering is currently at about what the fuel will cost to run the boat around the lake for two days. On top of that you get accoms, food, use of hot tub and the possibility of a back lake flyin ! What are you waiting for...."

682706,misfish,2012-04-01 21:08:00,29133,Hurry on the answer
682708,irishfield,2012-04-01 21:09:00,26272, ummm...no. You drive to Temagami.. we pick you up at the dock. 2 nights.. 2 days accoms.. all meals included. 2 days rigging for lakers or what every you want to do fishing wise out of our Lund and if the spouse wants to just lie on the dock and the weather allows we can do a back lake flyin and drop the canoe vs a day of charter.
682709,irishfield,2012-04-01 21:12:00,26272,"Here's the post.. seems to be the only one Mike hasn't put up.. maybe he's gonna bid himself on it and is keeping it secret!  Amazing Getaway for two on Lake Tamagami! Donated by Wayne O'Shea PLEASE NOTE**** THIS ITEM WILL FOLLOW DIFFERENT RULES! BID STARTS AT $450 (as requested by donator) BID INCREMENTS ARE $50 (also requested by donator) ... please read the description below for info :  Here’s the perfect chance to donate to a great cause and in return have the opportunity to spend TWO full days and nights at a Lake Temagami Island private retreat, at a mutually agreeable time between mid June and late September. The earlier you pick your dates the better, as our “dance” card is still pretty empty at this point from family and friends for 2012. It won’t be for long though, as the calendar fills up pretty fast and we will have to plan around our daughter’s next sarcoma check up that should be in July. This “package” can be any days of the week…. doesn’t have to be a weekend, but can be.  This auction is for TWO people, for TWO days and nights accommodations, with all meals included, and two FULL (8 to 10 hour) days of fishing/touring Lake Temagami aboard a fully equipped 2150 Lund Baron.       You choose what you want to do. Down rigging / flat lining for Lake Trout and Pickeral….casting for Pickeral/Bass/Pike in back bays…or we can mix it up, including a scenic tour of the North end of the lake if you so wish. Your call !  Perfect get away for a couple, or we can also accommodate two lads/gals in separate bedrooms if needed. Plan would be for you to arrive late on the chosen day and we’ll pick you up from the local marinas dock to bring you out to our cottage. Settle in, go for a swim, have supper and then watch the sunset. Heck we may even let you use the hot tub!       Then TWO full days of fishing and a late day departure on the “third” day. (ie: arrive late Friday.. leave late Sunday)  We will be there as well, just to make that clear, but what I am offering is something that is not available from anyone on the lake. Two full days of “charter” fishing, two nights accommodations, with all meals prepared. All you need to bring is your clothes, swimsuit, appropriate outerwear for the weather and your beverages. You can bring your favourite fishing gear, or you can just use mine… your choice. Great fishing right off the dock while you’re waiting for supper. If the winning bidder happens to be a couple and the wife (or husband) doesn’t want to spend all day or both days in a boat, and prefers a bit of sun tanning, canoeing or touring town…that can be arranged as well. While he/she’s doing that, we may find a different mode of transportation to an otherwise un-accessible location….but… no promises due to weather considerations for flying. Only real “house rule” is absolutely no smoking inside the cottage.  Minimum bid to start this auction is $450.00 and minimum bid raise increments are $50.  Bid High and bid often!  Thanks, Wayne"
682711,misfish,2012-04-01 21:15:00,29133,I had ask before and was told yes Wayne. No worries. Still a great offering.
682713,irishfield,2012-04-01 21:17:00,26272,It's only a 3 hour and 20 minute drive from Barrie Brian!!    Fuel prices this year.. a tour to the North or South end of the lake and back each day will cost about $200 PER day in fuel.
682721,Harrison,2012-04-01 21:29:00,2202,"Just shared the auction to the masses Mike. Good Luck, about 1/2 hour to go!"
682729,Handlebarz,2012-04-01 21:45:00,3790,Thanks Phil it looks like the wife will be busy after supper and for the next bunch of days. Thanks again so much everyone
