Lot's of follows and water temp was 50-52 degrees, down from those sunny days last week, but still warm enough for the pike. Spinnerbaits were getting follows, but husky jerks caught all the fish. Saw one muskie who chased a spinnerbait, but no fish in the shallows, so I guess it was a really fast spawn for the pike and muskie."

682106,nlpaintballer,2012-03-30 22:56:00,122,"lol, I try not to take pictures of 20"" snot rockets, I would run out of memory.  Sadly enough, I did take pictures of the one halfway through the filleting because it had eggs and I thought the guy's doing the studies of the pike invasion in the Kawarthas would maybe be interested in a 20"" pike with eggs. I didn't post it since some people might not like seeing a half filleted pike.  Don't worry though, as of sunday, every fish gets a picture with the OFC 2012 tourney paper next to it."

682112,Joeytier,2012-03-30 23:32:00,3990,Good goin.  Lake O pike have been hitting in the bays in 4-10 FOW pretty well without fail for the past 2 weeks.  Try slow rolling a big wobbler next time you're out.
682242,Rizzo,2012-03-31 13:33:00,4754,musky would not have spawned yet at that temp I don't think
682392,nlpaintballer,2012-03-31 22:30:00,122,"Rizzo, the muskie spawned last week when the water hit 50 the sunday before. 10 days ago the muskie were heavily into the spawn as well as the pike and water temps hit 60."
