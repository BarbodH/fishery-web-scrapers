680687,Ron,2012-03-27 21:21:00,1683,"Can anyone tell me where I can launch a boat to fish for the big Channel cats on the Grand? I want to take my daughter out for some extreme bottom fishing. She has caught many different species but she has never hooked into a big channel cat.  Any help would be greatly appreciated, PM me if you don't want to make it public.  Cheers, Ron..."
680690,Grimace,2012-03-27 21:30:00,2020,Fishmaster's has a launch in Dunnville.
680728,HTHM,2012-03-27 23:22:00,4082,"As well, if you go to Port Maitland there is a free launch there. You could also launch on the opposite side of the river or at the Dunville boat club just behind the Beer store."
680732,Fish4Eyes,2012-03-27 23:32:00,1022,"Unless you have a boat that sits very high in the water, i'm not a fan of the boat club launch. Not to mention that it's usually filthy, especially this time of year when boat traffic is not at its peak. It is also more expensive than Fishmaster's (8-10$ compared to $5) Your best bet would be to go to Fishmaster's launch or Port Maitland. Launching at Fishmaster's will put you very close to where the fish already are and have been caught. Good luck!"
680734,Pigeontroller,2012-03-27 23:36:00,2793,"Steve will take your money for launching, but he will also tell you where to fish..."
680771,johndox,2012-03-28 00:26:00,54,Two free launches in Cayuga and Ive been catching all kind of cats here the last week or so.
680974,johnnyb,2012-03-28 13:05:00,3413,  And his cut bait is great!  If the fish aren't biting....pickled sucker sandwiches
681314,pics,2012-03-29 00:46:00,1268,The launch in Port Maitland can be tricky if there are waves coming in from the lake...On a calm day you're good but it's a bit of a run to the cat fishing areas...
682442,fishboy,2012-04-01 02:27:00,550,where can you launch in Cayuga please?
