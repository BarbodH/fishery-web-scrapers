I cheered for the laffs yesterday.  :wallbash:  Who woulda thunk the laffs would help the SENS secure a playoff spot.  Thanks TML!!  :rofl2:"
682513,solopaddler,2012-04-01 13:55:00,8605,It's total chaos...cats and dogs living together LOL!  On a serious note may a plague of locusts descend on the Sens and all of their fans.
682514,muskymatt,2012-04-01 13:56:00,2608," They did, it's called laff fans at Scotia Bank Place......  :w00t:  :w00t:  :w00t:"
682520,solopaddler,2012-04-01 14:04:00,8605,"  No, I meant that literally not figuratively."
682521,BassMan11,2012-04-01 14:10:00,583,Hey just because we out number your fans 2 to 1 in your own rink and its the only place in the league that has the captain boo'd at home is pretty amazing really. Also if the game isnt done by 11 the people in kanata call and complain about the noise and they shut the lights off and tell everyone to go home.
682528,muskymatt,2012-04-01 14:15:00,2608,  Thank god locust season ends in March .....  :rofl2: .... only a couple more days until the plague is over. 
682530,Rod Caster,2012-04-01 14:17:00,5784,"nuts to Ottawa. Phx with two consecutive shutouts and poised to stay in the top 8...possibly a division win.  Mike Smith was an extremely pleasant suprise this year...how can phx continue to find cheap back up goalies, turn them into excellent #1's and the leafs desperately keep trying to mould Goofstavsen as he flops on the ice like a wounded sturgeon?"
682542,muskymatt,2012-04-01 14:39:00,2608,"After much hard work searching the seasonal movement of the locust, I have found where they summer after a long hard winter....  "
682543,BillM,2012-04-01 14:40:00,17367,Ben Scrivens did a good job yesterday!
682550,Oggie,2012-04-01 14:47:00,588," Wait until the goalie coach, Allair, gets a hold of him for the summer. He'll beat that standup style right out of him!   Just ask Reimer. He'll be sturgeon number 2 by next fall. Dan O."
682592,BillM,2012-04-01 16:37:00,17367," Let's hope not, I liked the fact that he wasn't on his knees the entire night!   Although he's worked with Allair before, I doubt he'll be changing styles anytime soon."
682595,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-04-01 16:41:00,310, Is that Brian Burke hiding his face in shame?   
682608,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-01 17:21:00,0, pretty sad that you count on OTHER teams to win for you.
682612,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-01 17:45:00,0," i am not the OP.  besides, MM is cheering for the leafs to benefit the sens.  you are cheering for the bruins because you are sad and bitter.  as i've stated many times, i cheer for the leafs MOST of the time.  i reserve all my hatred for the habs."
682667,BassMan11,2012-04-01 19:33:00,583, nice
682673,Pigeontroller,2012-04-01 19:58:00,2793,  LMAO!
