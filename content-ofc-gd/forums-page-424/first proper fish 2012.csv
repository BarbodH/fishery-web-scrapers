680637,BCLT,2012-03-27 18:35:00,86,Had a chance to get out to a swim an hour away - been fishing the centerpin for commons and landing a few fish up to 6 pounds isnt cutting it - heres a video of the session and a nice result at the end!   Thanks and best wishes to all of you http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhxPb4zVPQY&list=UUwWE8tYJaiHRujsQbb1p5wQ&index=1&feature=plcp
680658,mike rousseau,2012-03-27 19:29:00,4661,cool...  we have been getting the 5-15 pounders so far this season... im hoping to get something over 25lb soon... a lot of my swims are starting to hold carp now...  well done...nice video...
680663,Float Buddha,2012-03-27 19:59:00,20,"Great video, I hope to give the carp a shot tomorrow."
680665,Christopheraaron,2012-03-27 20:09:00,3525,"Nice fishing, I'm a newbie at carp fishing what is a swim?"
680666,davey buoy,2012-03-27 20:10:00,5505,"Also ,great video,this has to be the fastest growing fishing!.You see it on tv,and talked about everywhere.Need to give this a try soon."
680667,mike rousseau,2012-03-27 20:12:00,4661,  swim means a specific spot you like to fish...  when most of the info you read or see comes from the uk you pick up some of the phrases and slang...lol
680674,BCLT,2012-03-27 20:33:00,86,"   Mike hit the nail on the head!   Swim = spot Venue = lake or river Bivvy = tent Boilie = chunk of dough or corn meal Inline pear = big sinker Gutted = upset I lost my fish Chuffed to bits = Happy I got my fish Maize = corn Method mix = a bunch of oats and cream corn that can form a ball to bring fish in Baitrunner = reel that can switch to free spool (loose drag)   Ex, I was in my bivvy at the local venue, in my favourite swim, fishing an inline pear with some method mix and maize with a single boilie when a proper common took my rig and the baitrunner wasnt clicked on............ my rod went in the swim and I was gutted but I grabbed it quickly and landed the fish and I was chuffed to bits!  That should get you started - the rest is downhill lol...... ps remember.... until you get a baitrunner....... loosen your drag or so say goodbye to your rod when you grab a sandwich, take a leak, check your phone, or have a nap!

681488,Beans,2012-03-29 13:53:00,3339,Great video Shawn...After watching numerous UK videos all winter...[Carp Fishing] Korda Thinking Tackle Season 1 Episode 1 - YouTube It seems strange to see you using one rod only not that I'm an advocate of using more than one...I can just see myself trying to remove three lines at Carp Point when CPH gets a hook-up...
681614,Mike Pike,2012-03-29 17:36:00,1332,"Yup, that's me Shawn.  And I look forward to joining you on the bank for some carping real soon.  Just remember, you can't get mad when I cross your line, ok."

682050,BCLT,2012-03-30 20:13:00,86,"  Thats good, so If we dont share a bank by then, that will be the day! Its usually good times - see ya soon man"
