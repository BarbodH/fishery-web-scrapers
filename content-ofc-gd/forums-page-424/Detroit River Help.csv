678788,bucktail,2012-03-23 12:47:00,1857,Want to head down to the Detroit River for the first time sometime over the next month. I was wondering where the launches are and which ones are the closest and best to use.  Thanks  Darren
678803,Grimace,2012-03-23 13:29:00,2020,LaSalle has an awesome launch.  It is near fighting island.  That puts you close to some really good drifts.
678849,mpt,2012-03-23 16:20:00,158,I believe there's a city launch just south of the Ambassador bridge. Great morning bite there. I launch across the way.
678850,Fisher_1,2012-03-23 16:27:00,22,If you launch from LaSalle you are real close to the salt mine and lately theres has been alot of walleye getting pulled out there. and your also about a 10-15mins ride to Amherstburg if the Walleye have moved down thats way by the time you come.
678899,Handlebarz,2012-03-23 18:18:00,3790,You can be fishing within 5 min of you launch from lassalle all around the island. There were at least 15 boats around the salt today
678994,Bondy,2012-03-23 21:25:00,40,"Unless they improved it, the one next to the bridge sucks. There is a hole where my trailer got jammed in and I could not back the boat in any further. Haven't used it since. Lasalle is an awesome ramp and the islands will give protection from the wind. I would suggest getting at least a 1 day Michigan license just in case the Ontario side gets muddy, which it does often."
679202,wormdunker,2012-03-24 10:22:00,1711,Yup I have to agree with LaSalle launch.  It's right at the TD Canada Trust.  Follow the armada of boats to the east (I think) end of the island.  We catch some nice perch right at shore.  Easter week end will be very busy.  I'll probably be there for Easter.
679205,outllaw,2012-03-24 10:28:00,1232,"upper detroit river at lsc mouth. lakeview park marina, excellent double ramps. remember walleyes are on the spring run,their moving about in the system."
679309,bubbles,2012-03-24 15:17:00,591,"You have the best two options listed above, Lasalle and the city marina in the east.  stay away from the launch near the bridge, I think the last time it was maintained was in the 50s."
681427,duxbware,2012-03-29 11:55:00,102,"Hey guys,  I am hitting the Detroit River on Sunday for the first time. Any suggestions for equipment, tackle? I am always up for getting new gear!!!!  Thanks."
681491,Handlebarz,2012-03-29 13:56:00,3790,Finn s minnows stop in windsor or Lambeth rod ask for colors. Also Wyandot worm
681502,duxbware,2012-03-29 14:23:00,102,Thanks Mike P. Would mono work or should I get something different?
681507,DaveMc,2012-03-29 14:36:00,89,"i would run a hi viz 10lb braid, the hi viz will make it easier to see if your line gets off vertical"
681598,Handlebarz,2012-03-29 17:15:00,3790,Also search the site for the video that Brandon did with John bondy on jigging the DR. It will help the learning curve. Do a google search for the next bite for fishing the DR. You might also want  some monows just incase they want your jig to have meat on it. As of ten min ago the Canadian side was still muddy but cleaning up this was at the ambassador bridge.  For lineost use braid with floro
681915,bubbles,2012-03-30 12:48:00,591,"Be sure to have some floro on that braid as Mike suggests, if you are new to Jugging hte river you will snag up a few times and have to snap it off. Have fun!"
681917,duxbware,2012-03-30 12:51:00,102,Just got word form our contact on the river to stay home. They are calling for 90% rain on Sunday and the river is muddy. Thanks for all the advice. I will put it to use in the naer future!!  Thanks.
682030,Handlebarz,2012-03-30 18:56:00,3790,I just came over the bridge and yes the canadian side is double double. Will post pics layer if I can remember
682032,DaveMc,2012-03-30 19:13:00,89,"that sucks, i was gonna try to get down there this weekend."
