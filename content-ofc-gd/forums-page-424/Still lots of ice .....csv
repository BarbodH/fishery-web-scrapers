Many of the lakes still have a 3-6"" crust on them but some are nearly wide open...it all depends on exposure to sun and wind.  This one in particular, we had to walk right through the raspberry bushes and felled trees to get to a launchable spot. As we loaded and lauched, the GF was a bit freaked out  but with some positive encouragement and SLOW movements  we slipped the canoe off the crust and into the water. You would have thought she was on a big rollercoaster, approaching the apex and about to drop 500meters at 200km/hr.  We canoed around with no incident, had fun breaking thin ice and sunning a bit. To get back up we used a previously tied rope to provide us with a little more leverage.  Bring on summer.          "
