682186,Snidley,2012-03-31 03:52:00,620,"Currently the cost of keeping a federal inmate locked up for one year is $120K. The fiscal side of it alone should be enough to bring sanity to our drug laws let alone the ruination of peoples lives for a herb. The issues of turning our country into a lockup is fed by the same crowd that claims crime is up. Crime is down, massively so and it's violent crime that is down the most. What the authorities need to do is emphasize white collar crime where enforcement is lax often due to an inability of our police to comprehend the crimes and how they are perpetrated. Bringing it back to the science topic I consider deliberately and knowingly poisoning a major fishery a crime. Further, cover ups that obfuscate the condition of foodstuffs sold to international trading partners is a deliberate and large scale fraud. Our cops should be investigating but my bet is they would not know where to start. Having the Feds intimidate and muzzle the scientists most in the know about the actual goings on in our salmon fisheries is obstruction of justice. In a functioning democracy the cops would be on this case independently but I guess that's too much to ask when an ex PM can accept $100 K in cash, twice, for influence peddling without it being a crime. Or a finance minister can sell a steamship line for over $300 Million and still claim a tax return that shows a government salary as his only income. Or a whole government that sets up an inquiry that from the outset gives every government member immunity, appoints lawyers out the ying yang and results in a boondoggle of little impact that costs more than the actual scandal itself. Or an unqualified consultant who hooks up with the Defense Dept, waltzes with over $100 Million, gets caught, gets sentenced to 2 years less a day, gets out and no one requires that he produce the stolen money before he walks. I've said it before...we are doomed."

Sustainable business, utilizing the definitive sustainable resource , massive salmon runs. I know it's happening I just can't fathom why our government's would pick a foreign agribusiness with a sketchy past, poor profitability and a minute employment base over a traditionally lucrative business run by some of Canada's wealthiest businessmen. Why would these businesses allow this to happen. I really don't get it."
681297,Oggie,2012-03-29 00:27:00,588,I understand the need to keep a lid on employees asto what they say and to whom they speak. Once the study is published (thankfully the govt hasn't blocked publishing)  the scientist has a right/responsibility to discuss the conclusions. Freedom of speech  is what the world defends everyday.  The Harper govt is too controling in many aspects of governance IMO.

Is the science not available for scrutiny or does the government just not want its employes playing lobbyist in the media against its policies?  I know i wasn't too happy when government employees like the chiefs of police were on television lying about the gun registry, no im not saying that the scientists are lying, but considering most public servants likely don't vote or support the conservatives, and likely many of them were hired and grew up professionally under liberal governments, just how unbiased do we think they are?  I mean they are people like the rest of us.  Was there no muzzling of scientists under liberal governments?  Were they all free to say whatever they wished at any time or is there some increased backlash about this simply because it comes from a government they generally dislike, a government with different priorities, one that isn't going to feather their nest?  Well i have no idea, but it is really amusing to watch some people here argue from a clearly biased point of view, claiming they know what Canada is supposed to be, ie no war machines for us! how dare we!, and at the same time calling out others for their underlying beliefs.  We clearly all have biases, but to simply believe that scientists are being muzzled to the extent that the country is being harmed any more than in the past and without asking some questions is just asking to be misinformed.  Is all science good science, is all science worthy of our confidence, are all scientists?  Are all government decisions simply backward and unthinking because you find cause to disagree? Neither. I would hope that the government takes the science seriously, i hope that it isn't ignored even if they are telling scientists in our employ to not speak publicly, i don't know if they are, and i don't know they aren't.  I suspect that if we are all honest about our biases most of us would agree that we dont know.  In any case i don't suspect non action on the part of the current government in the case of the BC salmon farming will be any different than the non action by previous governments, in four years someone else may have a chance to change things.  Some of you seem to think that Canada will be destroyed by then, a part of the USA, how little credit you give this country."

That said this is an important issue and one that is been raised by many scientists inside and outside of the country. I don't think it is a stretch to say that the current government is not a big fan of science and statistics as it gets in the way of ideology, its funny how that works.  On another point about the cbc being a lefty bias reporting agency, I am not sure I buy it. How does one explain the Dragons Den, Lang & O'leary, or Coaches Corner?"
681675,Jer,2012-03-29 20:30:00,1426,  Because they need to have at least a few shows that bring in some ratings and revenue. They can only beg so much from the taxpayer.
681680,Snidley,2012-03-29 20:37:00,620,"I have to agree with Torco I don't see much if any  liberal bias at CBC. Occasionally Arliene Dickenson does some less than financially prudent investing based on touchy feely input, but, she turns a buck with it as well. Any reporting I have seen has always just shared basically the same facts the other media outlets reported. Sun TV might be somewhat biased but they are clearly not reporters, they are pundits, which is a much different thing. I don't think the Sun personalities even attempt to call what they do reporting.  As far as chiefs of police are concerned, they have good reason to address what they feel is an ongoing threat to their cops in not knowing if a household has firearms or not. Bottom line is that domestic disputes are highly unpredictable and are situations where cool heads are not prevailing. It is valuable to know if there is any sort of firearm available to a potential perp especially in those domestic situations. Unfortunately the Liberals made a complete botch of the whole thing but I certainly hope Canada never gets to the point of the USA where civilians can stockpile virtually any arsenal they want up to and including 50 cal sniper cannons and mega clip semi auto anti personnel weapons."

To the same point, why should an officer approach the house of a law abiding, gun owning citizen any different than thay would any other citizen's home. Seems to be a double-standard in your world where non-gun owners should be treated different than legal gun owners.   But, thank God, that's all water under the bridge."

Some of these are prohibited, restricted and non restricted. I bet you may be surprised at what gets what classification. We have gotten way way off topic here but. I think either way no matter what I had or didn't have, I would think police should enter my home the very same way they would enter any other home.  If there is a registered gun in a house, does that mean the officer enters the house with his sidearm unholstered with the safety off or if there is no gun registered should he enter the house with his gun locked away in his trunk? I don't get it."

As I said domestic calls are very scarey and under the duress of a painful domestic situation lubricated by alcohol ""law abiding"" citizens can and do go ape. Same goes for  individuals that feel bullied, alienated etc.There's remorse afterward but by then the damage is done. The damage is mitigated if the perp does not have automatic or mega clip weaponry at their disposal. America is the test case that exemplifies this fact virtually every day"
681885,blarg,2012-03-30 05:26:00,289," And yet there are more guns than ever in the US, record sales over the last few years in fact, and the murder rate is declining, so..more guns, and less murders, now im not suggesting a correlation of more guns = less murders, but it does seem to put a crimp in the often said and never proved theory you're espousing.  But hey, the irony that these sort of theories pop up in a thread about science is at least amusing.  But no, no one is biased here."

So if you have one it is not registered in a registry as you can't own it.

682161,Snidley,2012-03-31 02:04:00,620,"My point exactly. I said I'm glad we don't permit that type of weapon in the hands of civilians in Canada. My further point was that Chiefs of Police were and are interested in the safety of their men. They are on the front lines of the thing and the peanut gallery is interested in having a gun collection unbeknownst the police. Like there's going to be a revolution /invasion and guys are going to hold out with their hunting gear. I also admit that the implementation was amateurish and a laughable exercise by incompetents and, as is often the case, a valid idea was done in by the implementation.

You could have chosen to link the studies results like I did. Perhaps you can review those studies and comment on the results and what you think they mean instead of posting a pollitically charged biased article because it supports your pollitical viewpoints.

I really hope that everybody who is commenting is reading some of the links are are becoming aware of the impact that farmed salmon are having on wild salmon stocks. Arguing that present government in Canada is no worse than any past government is just plain wrong. Sure the liberals had the sponsorship scandal, and as it turned out were quite dirty, but the conservatives are not better (election rigging, in and out scandal). The facts are that the Conservatives are currently ruling Canada like a dictatorship. At least when the liberals did something wrong they were repentant and it seemed like they cared about making it right. The conservative government seems to think that it is above the law, and that it can act as it wants without consequence. Case in point: the current electoral scandal. And they are acting as this thread is going, by attacking their biggest critic (I hope you have all seen the new attack add against Bob Rae. I think this is a political issue, because the salmon stocks are worth saving. The Conservative government has made it clear that they have made their mind up on this issue. If you can't change the mind of the government, maybe you need to change the government itself. If we do not make noise on this topic nothing will be done. Accuse me of having a Liberal bias all you want. If you love the outdoors, and fishing in particular, you need to realize that the Conservatives are not doing you any favors."
680952,turtle,2012-03-28 12:35:00,274,"Watch Sun News then watch CBC.  The truth will be somewhere in the middle absent the political spin.  I am sure everyone on this forum loves the environment and wants to protect it.  Anything other than the truth, which these days can be very difficult to determine, is political spin attaching labels to the respective positions. Right or left labels aside, governments are influenced by and controlled to some extent by big corporations and big corporations act in their self-interest, meaning profits with no national loyalty. Of course corporations have to make profits to exist but the government's responsibilty is to protect the environment and our national interest."
680960,Snidley,2012-03-28 12:45:00,620,"The sad truth is that Liberals are equally culpable, they are in charge in BC and could do something about the leases on the water where the pens are situated plus this virus/ leukemia situation has been around on the east coast for a long time even back to when the Libs were running things Federally. Like most things that are important, and the Sockeye run involved here can run into the millions of fish so it's important, leaving it up to the government is a mistake. Unfortunately the Feds do have management jurisdiction over Salmon, the province of BC has jurisdiction over the waters were these pens are situated and neither of them are prepared to take on a foreign company that is poisoning the wild stocks of Sockeye, Coho and Chinnook salmon all so BC can ship farmed mutant salmon into a market that is already saturated with farmed salmon from elsewhere. It's the kind of governmental business decision only some lawyers that have managed to get themselves elected could make. The whole thing is stupid, will be exposed to the complete embarrassment to all involved, and could conceivably ruin huge sections of the BC salmon run with dire consequences for Orcas, seals and oh ya fisherman both commercial and recreational. It appears that fisherman are already being effected with the announcement of large scale retention cuts. Undoubtedly the Orcas and seals are being effected too, but they don't have a voice. So as far as politics are involved there are no good guys just dicks that are drunk with power but will sellout for a few bucks. In other words situation normal. I don't know what the public can really do other than refrain from buying farmed salmon and pressuring grocery retail stores to stop selling tainted farmed fish. It sounds lame but if anyone is following the story of ""pink slime"" in the US it seems consumers do in fact hold a trump card when addressing an issue like this. Publicity is key of course, so I guess it comes full circle back to an aggressive and respected press/tv media. Clearly the CBC is not that trusted source and it seems the whole issue has not been addressed by other media. Basically it's just one more stinking mess that will crawl under the radar until it becomes a full blown disaster.   :wallbash:"

As soon as you start bashing one side or the other the other side isn't going to listen and you may in the process lose some fence sitters. Try and be a little non biased and maybe just maybe you may do some good rather than just further divide people. The libs done there fair share of negative environmental impact.

The conservative government, along with certain other right wing politicians in Canada seem to prefer to silence critics when they can, or attack their credibility when they cannot silence them. (A tactic that Torontonians may recognize) Dr Sal mentioned his oath to add information. If you read the article you could infer with the information from this thread the the scientist in question would be putting her career in jeopardy if she were to talk out about the issue."
680803,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-28 01:40:00,0,"jedi  i did not politicize this debate.  the article is here to keep my fellow anglers informed of relevant fishing related news.  were this the liberals or ndp in power, i would be posting the same article.   But it's not. This debate was politicized the moment you accused the article of being 'liberal bias'.  so don't accuse me of doing something that you yourself propagated.  we should share these concerns as anglers, not as partisan hacks."
680804,jedimaster,2012-03-28 01:41:00,3472," Funny how you mention this but I presume you're a liberal since you seem to be against the rights, Wasn't it the liberal Leader in the last election that was an american defector? Stick up for Canada be a liberal you say? Hmm, it was the american liberal leader that was one of the big reasons why I voted for the conservatives for the first time in a federal election."
680805,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-28 01:42:00,0," this has nothing to do with the topic at hand, which is the possible muzzling of federal scientists. why are you now insulting another poster for sharing my concerns?"
680806,Joeytier,2012-03-28 01:43:00,3990,We don't live in a country with a two-party system...
680807,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-28 01:45:00,0, amen joey.  ORANGE WAVE!!!!
680814,jedimaster,2012-03-28 01:52:00,3472,"As for the cbc not being biased, don't forget that the CBC admited this themselves when they were forced to do an investigation on themselves for being liberal biased. None the less. I guess I wrongly presummed you were thinking about the science behind the article and te information behind that versus the actual debate about the pollitics. So just to be clear, none of this thread was about the actual Information in the report in question (That again is freely available online)... it was all about the pollical aspect."
680821,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-28 02:00:00,0,this thread is about muzzling of federal scientists as stated in the subject.  the few of you that come here to cause trouble will not find any here and i'm not going to allow childish insults thrown at myself and other posters to derail a very important topic.  here is a year old article on the subject where 500 leading scientists contacted the government about their stifling of federal scientists. http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2011/04/26/science-federal-cswa-letter.html
680823,jedimaster,2012-03-28 02:00:00,3472,"  Ahh yes, I forgot about the valiant Orange. Or I gues you could be bloq as well. My sincere appologies."
680825,Snidley,2012-03-28 02:01:00,620,"I strongly suggest that guys here read Alex Morton's blog from start to finish. This issue includes strong arm methods, literally, to silence a government scientist, misuse of Canadian courts to silence and deport a critic, deliberate lies to long time trading partners to  benefit of a non Canadian corporation with a long history of corruption and dirty dealing, and the outcome has the potential to ruin one of the worlds largest and best sources of natural protein. The whole thing trumps an oath to a disingenuous partner, a partner that had no intention of honorable dealing from the get go. It has been going on for a long time and the Liberals are involved as well. In truth I'm personally a little right of Attilla the Hun but this scandal transcends political parties. It is simply crime for money which maybe makes it, in fact, politics at it's very heart."
680828,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-28 02:08:00,0,people who vote for the ndp are separatists?  that's new.  you're only embarrassing yourself now.
680832,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-28 02:11:00,0,here's a non-cbc article on the subject. http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20120302/journal-nature-tells-canada-to-stop-muzzling-scientists-120302/
680833,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-28 02:13:00,0,and here is a Sun Media article on the subject. http://www.torontosun.com/2012/03/02/science-journal-to-feds-stop-muzzling-scientists
680834,solopaddler,2012-03-28 02:14:00,8605," And I'd like to know what really happened in Area 51, but it's not going to happen.    Snidely is a font of useful information.    You seem angrier than usual tonight.     No of course you didn't."
680836,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-28 02:17:00,0,"hmmmm... another personal attack in lieu of anything intelligent to add.  but alas, i won't bite tonight solo.  you'll have to go start trouble elsewhere as i feel this is an important subject."
680837,Joeytier,2012-03-28 02:19:00,3990,"What does my affiliation or support for any party have to do with this?  I wave no flag for any party, as I'm not so jaded as to think any suit dummy on parliament has any concern for my best interests.  And if you think ANY majority government would like their citizens fully involved in key environmental decisions, then you think too highly of those in power."
680842,jedimaster,2012-03-28 02:32:00,3472,"I don't at all blame the Conservatives for this. The Scientists knew what they were getting into. Lets think back about what happened when the liberals had there last majority, Weasling around with Kyoto, The liberals were bought out by the oil companies...  quoted from a Globe and mail article...  Even Liberal members of Parliament are starting to express concern over the government's lack of environmental commitment on global warming and on achieving its goal under Kyoto to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent from 1990 levels by 2012.  The thing is EVERY party while in power has no choice but to bend and shape its policies so that the big companies can be profitable. Thats just the way it goes. We don't live in a perfect world and sorry to say it never will be. In fact if I recall off hand it was the Oil Companies that were backing the liberals in those days to get Kyoto waxed.  I remember being so angry at the liberals, and every environmentalist was so pissed abou this, everyone was screaming and shouting at the Libs for this. To think things would be any different if the NDP or Libs were in charge is just juvinile. These pollitical arguments are just silly.  Talk about the science. Please do. Argue about this party is bad or that party is bad and you will just end up painting yourself as a right wing whacko or  left wing whacko. There are right wing whackos and Left wing whackos."
680844,jedimaster,2012-03-28 02:37:00,3472," I think if you read through any of my posts you would see that I would agree with you on this point. These guys win, things sway this way, those guys win it sways a bit back the other way. Thats the only way there is useful progresion. IN the pollitical system we have its only under a majority that anythign actually gets done. Good or bad things get done. Over time things balance out one way or another.  To think that things are bad because Party X is in power, is as crazy as thinking if Party Y was in power everything would be perfect."
680845,solopaddler,2012-03-28 02:37:00,8605," Yep that's me, constantly attacking people with absolutely nothing of value to add to any conversation.  I think the non fishing posts on OFC are great, they're part of what makes this such a great place to hang out.  In my useless opinion politics is a subject that doesn't belong here.  But I digress, you've got a lively debate going here, mostly with yourself.  Carry on..."
680847,jedimaster,2012-03-28 02:40:00,3472,  No offense but you brought your pollitical viewpoint into this thread not me.

680701,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-27 22:18:00,0,anybody else concerned?
680704,jedimaster,2012-03-27 22:30:00,3472,"Not really, the report is available online. Its just the liberal biased CBC trying to begrudge the PC's... Just like Fox News in the US. CBC is silly.  http://www.cohencommission.ca/en/  Just use the search function on that site for Kristi Miller, you will find much information from here there."
680706,Joeytier,2012-03-27 22:33:00,3990," Precisely what they want!  An open, science-based community of critical thinkers in this country might just be detrimental to Stephen and his bunch of backward-thinking criminals.  An ugly picture is starting to unfold..."
680713,Grimace,2012-03-27 22:44:00,2020,"Science and reason do not get along with Mr Harper in any way, shape or form."
680716,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-27 22:56:00,0,"sorry to say, but you have to have a background in biology to interpret scientific journals, which is why it is necessary for scientific studies to be explained to society at large in a way that they understand the findings.  i love righties and their claims of liberal bias.  i don't think it's too much to ask that our PUBLIC servants be accountable to the public."
680718,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-27 22:58:00,0,"liberal bias is what righties say when the media proves conservatives are incorrect on something.  it's a sad and tiresome defense mechanism that nobody believes, so why do you keep saying it?"
680720,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-27 23:01:00,0,"when i was in the public service i was forced to swear an oath not to talk about my work to the public or the media.  that is Bull because i work for you, the people, not mr. harper."
680721,jedimaster,2012-03-27 23:05:00,3472,"Its fairly standard practise for public servants to not disclose information to the public. I did the same thing when working for several government agencies, even ones while the liberals were in charge. Its nothing new. I am not against science, I am not even against the liberals. However it took a majority govt to erase the retardedness known as the gun registry that the liberals shoved down everyones throat. So now because of that stupididity we need to put up with the PC's for a few more years. Then we can go back to a fence sitting minority where nothing gets done, and everyone can be happy again."
680723,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-27 23:11:00,0,"i feel it is the publics right to know what public servants are doing with their tax dollars, don't you?"
680724,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-27 23:14:00,0,i have no problems with the removal of the gun registry.  it's everything else they've done since that burns my britches... cutting back on science and environment agencies to fund the building of prisons and war machines is ridiculous and against the principles our country is built on.  but keep voting to make harpers friends rich!  i can't wait until these bible thumping domestic terrorists are sent packing!
680730,Snidley,2012-03-27 23:24:00,620,"That entire scene is a mess. I have been following Alexandra Morton's blog all along and it is an eye opener. It began by letting a foreign commercial interest  farm Atlantic Salmon in the Pacific in the middle of one of the Earth's largest sources of quality protein, the Fraser Sockeye run. The involvement of the Privy Council, which is essentially the PM, in this case shows political meddling plain and simple to shield a group of unscrupulous scoundrels use a Canadian base of operations to poison Canadian waters and ship tainted food to our trading partners. Officially gagging the Federal scientists that could have shed light on the issue is a scary perversion of democracy that reminds me of the worst aspects of the democracy to the south of us. All this will seem like small potatoes when our international customers evaluate what we have been selling them as premium product. The poop will really hit the fan at the WTO when it comes to light internationally that a ""Canadian"" (but really Norwegian)agribusiness knowingly shipped disease contaminated products overseas to good faith trading partners. It just goes to show how perverted the business/government relationship has become."
680733,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-27 23:34:00,0,thanks for that new resource snidley...thankfully harper can't gag order everybody.  http://alexandramorton.typepad.com/

I consider myself on the fence when it comes to pollitics. But man o man I just can't help but be shoved over to thr right side. Good thing I wasn't in charge. I would have the lefties throwing seal pups at me and righties tossing bibles at me."

680756,Old Man,2012-03-28 00:12:00,822, So we can draw from this that you're a hypocrite?
680757,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-28 00:13:00,0,"  another brilliant post.  nothing intelligent to say, so you insult my integrity instead.  nicely done."

680760,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-28 00:19:00,0," don't worry about that crud FG.  in place of having anything to contribute to the discussion, people feel that they can replace knowledge with slander and attempt to deflect attention from important issues with meaningless insults.  it does little to further their agenda, in fact it probably furthers mine."
680763,Gregoire,2012-03-28 00:20:00,1397,"Something familiar is happening with this thread. Instead of examining an issue, a person who believes in the issue is being attacked. Either take part in a legitimate conversation arguing a point, or do not participate. Unfortunately far too often in our society people try to discredit people who have opinions that they do not agree with, maybe because they do not have the intellect to argue a legitimate point."
680765,Old Man,2012-03-28 00:21:00,822," I'm sorry, but the statement above does bring your integrity into question. I've never taken money or participated in any job or oath that I'd didn't fully believe in. Using the  symbol does make my point go away or lessen it's value."
680767,Grimace,2012-03-28 00:24:00,2020,This is a very important subject that has raised very serious and intelligent discussion right across this country.  This is not a left or right issue.  There are many people on both sides of the political spectrum that are enraged by this.  Don't cheapen this discussion with the left/right Bull.  Science should never be stifled or silenced.  When the findings of scientific study are silenced and covered up it is usually because somebody's got something to hide.  History always frowns on this type of thing.  You can only silence science for so long before the truth comes out.
