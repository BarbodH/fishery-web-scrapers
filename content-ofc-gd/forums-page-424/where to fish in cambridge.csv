681306,ricardo,2012-03-29 00:39:00,26,I'm kinda new to the fishing scene and was hoping on hitting some great locations to catch some fish in cambridge. My issue is I have no boat or access to a boat. Can't seem to find any solid locations to catch a fighter. Any help would be appreciated.
681313,hammercarp,2012-03-29 00:46:00,964,The Speed and Grand Rivers. There is great multi -species fishing from shore. If it's fighters you want try carp.
681586,ricardo,2012-03-29 16:39:00,26,Any specific spots along the grand?
