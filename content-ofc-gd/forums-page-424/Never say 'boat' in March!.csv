Went for a drive looking for some open water yesterday........found some at Eagle Lake                  As soon as i got home i called my buddy Cliff to say 'GET THE BOAT READY!' We headed back today to cast from shore, with half a foot of snow on the ground!!!! Roloff got his first taste of fishing open water....he likes it!          <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/7oehDYylrsI"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"

682113,Joeytier,2012-03-30 23:35:00,3990,Awesome!  My lab used to drag 20 + lb pound chinook out of small streams by their back.  Now he won't even so much as acknowledge a fish.
