681792,mike rousseau,2012-03-30 00:29:00,4661,http://fishing4tails.com/  greg amiel is a first class guy... and well accomplished tournament angler on lake o...  went for salmon with him 3 years ago... 21 on 17 landed... mostly big chinooks... couple rainbows...  we went mid aughust for the staging spawners
681797,spincast,2012-03-30 00:35:00,3279,  yup. what he said.
681799,asdve23rveavwa,2012-03-30 00:36:00,2690,"  Yupper , after the trip four of us had with Lloyd two years ago (everyone of us landed five fish...no, we didn't keep them all...before someone has a hissy fit) no doubt in my mind."
681839,miller,2012-03-30 02:16:00,223,fintastic sportfishing is another good one to check out that operates in the niagara region http://www.fintasticsportfishing.com/
681842,curryale,2012-03-30 02:20:00,26," I have been out with several different outfitters mainly on corporate trips with clients.  The best I have found for a trip with lots of fish and professional service is Ryan Hare with ""we pound em fishing"".  I would recommend him very highly."
681849,fishnsled,2012-03-30 02:50:00,3520,  I know who's boat I'd be on as well....
681851,wallacio,2012-03-30 02:51:00,475,"I'll second Curryale's recommendation.   I've been out on a bunch of charters (entertaining clients) and hands-down I would recommend Ryan of We Pound 'Em.   Not only has Ryan become a personal friend of mine, he and his crew are very professional and most importantly they are passionate about what they do so an amazing day is almost a given.   Last trip out my clients had the time of their lives with the highlight being a fish that was in the top ten of the week in the Great Ontario Salmon Derby."
681864,fishdawg,2012-03-30 03:14:00,912,another vote for FINtastic Sportfishing  http://www.fintasticsportfishing.com/  Shane is excellent to deal with and a pleasure to fish with.

681965,fishnsled,2012-03-30 15:24:00,3520, I did notice that but didn't want to embarrass Lloyd....
681991,kenzy31,2012-03-30 16:55:00,261," X3, class act and catches fish! Looking to book with him myself at the end of June"
