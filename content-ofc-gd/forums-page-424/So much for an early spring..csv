682069,lew,2012-03-30 21:03:00,12766,A week ago we were basking in 75 degree sunshine and talkin about the flowers blooming and the buds coming out on the trees.  I'm looking out my window right now and it's starting to snow.  Only in Canada
682071,davey buoy,2012-03-30 21:08:00,5505," Just a minor bump in the road,enjoy the snow while it lasts!lol."
682072,misfish,2012-03-30 21:24:00,29133,"As much as I liked those few days of +20 temps,we need these cooler temps to stabilize the water in the ground.Drying to fast is not good.Give the grass proper time to get green and prevent grass fires."
682075,Twocoda,2012-03-30 21:30:00,4130,snowing pretty good here too....maybe ill get to fire up the snowblower again this year...
682078,Raf,2012-03-30 21:31:00,3495,"Bit of hail and calling for snow this evening around Orangeville.  I'm glad it cooled down again, we had mosquitos in that hot spell up here, this'll kill that batch."
682083,mike rousseau,2012-03-30 21:52:00,4661,i think that really warm stretch we had was great... got everyone of that unsafe ice we had most of the winter...  jumped spring ahead a couple weeks... now temps went back to normal to give the spawners time to do their thing...  eliminated that time in the spring when it smells like dung everywhere...  and jump started my carp fishing season by 2-3 weeks...
682137,bigugli,2012-03-31 00:48:00,6138,Dashing through the snow.....
682151,msp,2012-03-31 01:27:00,1336,I just got off the water. had a snow storm on the lake. Im embracing the cold temps now so that things get back to normal for walleye opener
682154,Moosebunk,2012-03-31 01:40:00,3970,"Love ice fishing... but gotta say, three outings in the boat during that warm front were something really great.  Prolonged ""spring"" cold water fishing is fine by me."
682173,tomO,2012-03-31 03:00:00,363,"Been mowing grass here the last 2 weeks. Had easter lillies blooming a month ago, hope it's not a sign of a long hot and dry summer."
682213,Rattletrap2,2012-03-31 11:49:00,1652," Hey Tom, I'm just a bit North of you in Cleveland right now and I'd say they are a few weeks ahead of us in Ontario. The grass is very long and very green here. Things were just starting to green up back home when I left a week ago."
682270,Whopper,2012-03-31 15:43:00,2174,Lew we had a small cold front along with some heavy rains and hail last night. Other than that everything here is in full bloom and I've mowed my yard three times already and it's due again
682274,Rizzo,2012-03-31 16:16:00,4754,"last week was summer, now we are back to fall"
682275,Tootsie II,2012-03-31 16:19:00,162,"Here in Owen Sound it's a given that we can expect one short lived snow fall in the first week of April. Like everything else so far this year, it was just a couple of days early. LOL."
682536,Tdel,2012-04-01 14:24:00,393,"  Snowed here again last night.  As long as we don't get a major storm I am happy with what is hitting the ground every now and then.  Of course all of this white stuff outside, could just be an April Fools joke.  Tom"
