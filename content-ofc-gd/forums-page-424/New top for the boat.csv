682148,Bernie,2012-03-31 01:11:00,3190,The old top was getting a little ragged so I had a new one made. Turned out pretty good. A little more headroom too.    This was the first trip out with it for the season. The ice is off the bay over to my place but there is still some out on the main lake. Took this shot of the ice piled up on an island behind mine. Has to be close to 20 ft high. 
682171,tomO,2012-03-31 02:56:00,363,Very cool Wish I was there.
682197,Terry,2012-03-31 09:13:00,14456,"a good top and make all the difference in lousy weather, looks good"
682199,googie,2012-03-31 09:32:00,23,Very nice top.  how much does it cost?
682205,Roy,2012-03-31 10:36:00,13728,"Very nice Bernie! Is that Sunbrella, Top Gun? Or? Very, very nice."
682224,Bernie,2012-03-31 12:39:00,3190,"Hi Roy.  There is a local fellow that makes these up. He has a trailer equipped with all he needs to make them. He is often at our shop making tops for us. I asked him about making me one and did it that day.  Googie, he did it for a very reasonable price."
682227,Big Cliff,2012-03-31 12:55:00,6899,That is so cool Bernie! Does he ever come down to the Kawartha's?
682228,lew,2012-03-31 12:56:00,12766,Looks really nice Bernie.  Ya can't beat fishing under a good top on a stormy day.
682233,Bernie,2012-03-31 13:07:00,3190,"Hiya Cliff. No, he doesn't head down that way. He stays pretty busy up here. But he might if it were off season and there were several to do at the same time. I could ask him.  You are right Lew. Makes fishing on a miserable day OK. I use this boat every day to commute to work in the open water season so it makes those trips more comfortable as well. No rain in my coffee cup"
682235,fishnsled,2012-03-31 13:12:00,3520,Looks great Bernie! I need something like that for those cold winding days in November on Quinte.
682237,Jer,2012-03-31 13:17:00,1426,"  If you need some work done locally Cliff, this guy does real nice work:  Sew It All 2500 Chemong, Bridgenorth, ON K0L 1H0 (705) 292-0628 â€Ž   Looks all warm and comfy in the boat, Bernie."

682257,Big Cliff,2012-03-31 14:34:00,6899, Thanks! I think I might just give him a call! The older I get the more important comfort seems to be LOL.
682259,Big Cliff,2012-03-31 14:35:00,6899,
682266,Pikeslayer,2012-03-31 15:25:00,1443,"    Aaaaahhhhhh, comfort is a good thing"
682471,Spiel,2012-04-01 10:57:00,9065,Looks great Bernie! Guess I'll have to come up and check out the comfort level in person.
