329949,Busher,2009-04-14 14:21:00,9,"Hope someone can help out.  I am looking to head up to the Hailburton area either this weekend ( April 17) or the next, does anyone know if the ice is out yet.  More specifically I was going to hit Kennisis Lake.  Thanks"
329951,ccmtcanada,2009-04-14 14:24:00,7971,Not sure where that lake is....  It may be on this sattelite shot taken yesterday afternoon....  http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/mod...es.143.250m.jpg
329969,Nemo,2009-04-14 15:19:00,727,I was up at Kennisis last weekend and it is still covered with Ice. Depending on weather I think it may not clear out till after the 25th of April.
330070,Busher,2009-04-14 21:20:00,9,"Well here's hoping the warm weather this week makes a difference, I was hoping to head up there the weekend of the 24-25th!!"
330076,Bigworm,2009-04-14 21:32:00,119,Was near Halls Lake on the weekend. Here's a pic to give you an idea. I will be going up again this weekend. Will report again upon return.  Mark 
330293,singingdog,2009-04-15 11:12:00,1047,"Kinnesis still has a fair bit of ice cover. I am heading up that way today or tomorrow and will check it for you. I doubt it will completly up by this weekend, but it's a good chance it will by the the 24th."
330319,Busher,2009-04-15 13:13:00,9,"Thanks for the info, any updates would be appreciated!!!!  Dying to get on the water!!"
330719,singingdog,2009-04-16 12:53:00,1047,"I was on Kinnesis yesterday. There is a small - 3 acre - area of open water where it flows in from Little Kinnesis. The wind was breaking the ice up fairly quickly, but the rest of the lake still has about 3"" of very rotten ice on it.  Little Kinnesis - and other area lakes with no flow through them - are still bank-to-bank, but getting dark."
330741,Busher,2009-04-16 14:00:00,9,"Great, thanks for the heads up!!"
331081,fishboy,2009-04-17 03:38:00,550,thanks for the update
331166,Busher,2009-04-17 13:23:00,9,This might help.  It's not Kennisis Lake but it still gives you a decent idea of the conditions in Haliburton  http://www.halcom.ca/haliburton.php
331454,singingdog,2009-04-18 10:55:00,1047," That's Head Lake, right in the village of Haliburton: closed until Walleye opener (fish sanctuary). It opens up fairly early because of strong current at both ends. Just to give you an idea of the speed of the melt, it was still mostly ice covered (80%) this time last week."
331497,dada2727,2009-04-18 15:01:00,108,"I heard today some info on Gull lake.  Miners bay was still iced up as of yesterday, and the deep bay launch was a wash out.  I heard there was a launch somewhere on the north end, possible around sandy bay?"
333007,Busher,2009-04-21 13:46:00,9,Hey Bigworm  Any update on the ice conditions in the Haliburton area to report on from your weekend visit.  Any updates would be appreciated.  Thanks
333390,singingdog,2009-04-22 10:52:00,1047,"We paddled Kennisis on Sunday. Most of the lake still had 1-2"" of slush on top. We could get through it in kayaks, and it was breaking up fast. My guess is that Kennisis and most other good-sized lakes will be open by this weekend. Little Kennisis has gone from all-white ice to broken-up dark ice: it will probably be 4-5 days behind Kennisis."
333418,Busher,2009-04-22 12:59:00,9,"Singing Dog, that is the best news I have heard this week.  Thanks very much for the update!!"
