332950,bigugli,2009-04-21 11:48:00,6138,"There is a huge gap, in this age, between need and want. I don't have 1/2 the tackle my son does, but I use everything in my bag of tricks.  All the bells and whistles are nice, but they don't make a good angler.  I remember being told this story once.  At one of these big tournies, in Florida, you have the big names, boats, reputations to match going after big $. One angler had carefully prefished  the Big O with all sorts of lures and tactics.  He kept quiet about the areas he had fished, hadn't spooked them. Knew what they would chase and marked them on the GPS. After the 1st day this angler is in the top 5, and he has saved his honey hole til day 2. Next morning, blasts off in his Ranger with the big Merc doing 100 across the lake to race to the sweet spot. He figures he's got the tourny in the bag. Gets there to find a local is sitting right in the middle of the hole. As he pulls up, the local waves him over, as he catches another hefty fish. Being a typical fisherman he can't wait to boast.  ""Fish were on fire. They just kept inhaling the shad"", he'd boast. ""You can have the spot now, and don't you worry son, I put all the bigguns back"""
332960,lew,2009-04-21 12:08:00,12766," I'm the same as you Mark, cept I took early retirement 9 years ago and have decided that after all these years I've earned a nice(er) boat for my golden years......even though I've always  had nice boats. I went out in February and layed down a bag of $$$$ and got exactly what I wanted.  It's always been my way of thinking that if a man really wants something, he should go for it.  I went with the biggest boat and the biggest engine I've ever had, but it's something I wanted and I can't see any   sense putting in a lifetime of work and then not getting the toys we deserve."
333038,hotrod,2009-04-21 15:02:00,103,"I don't feel guilty for buying something I've wanted my whole life. Green or not. As a matter of fact I'm sick of hearing all this green, global warming guilt trip. I don't throw my garbage out the window, I pick up when I can, I recycle and I try not to make waste and I don't leave my truck running so I can have ac while I'm waiting for someone or something, there's plenty I do to try and not make a mess of things.  In the big picture am I polluting the air as compared to an 18 wheeler belching black smoke into the air, or a taxi driving 24 hours/day idling and running, or how about racing bikes, skidoos, cars, waterskier tubers or whatever. How about them coal fired power plants premier dad was gonna close?  No, I'm not going to feel guilty for running my boat around the lake and not being as green as some would like."
333040,Stoty,2009-04-21 15:09:00,2910," AMEN brother!  Like you said....most people are doing a lot of ""green"" things around their house/workplace which make much more of a difference than running boats for a few months. (This is Canada, where you can only run a boat for 60% of the year in most locations).  My house has CFL lightbulbs, energy efficient appliances, low flow toilets, proper insulation/windows, etc, etc.  Not to mention my Ranger has a 4-stroke. I'm about as ""green"" as the Bass Boat world comes. So...your darn right I am going to enjoy it and not feel guilty for it!"
332387,Chris,2009-04-20 10:31:00,405,There are far more recreational fishermen than tournament fishermen. Maybe the focus should be on recreational anglers first.
332402,hotrod,2009-04-20 11:30:00,103,"Bass boats aren't the only ones with big motors ripping around the lake. I've almost been run over more than once by people pulling waterskiers not watching where they're going and by jetskiers also.  I fished 60 hp and unders, 125 and unders and now I have a 21' with a 225 so I can fish all the big water tournies that I couldn't with a smaller boat and I like the bigger boat much better than the others I've fished from. Many times it's a safety issue also, I don't think the boats from the 60's would have held up on big water like Waynes' lund or a 21'er. It's not about the boat it's about being able to fish big water safely in tournaments and fishing in general here on lake Nipissing.  As for the green tournament idea, I don't think it will have much interest from anyone I know who fishes... especially now with gas under a dollar/litre."

332490,Stoty,2009-04-20 14:26:00,2910, Restrict all boats to be 4-stroke maybe...?    Took the words right out of my mouth.
332491,JeffBornFishin,2009-04-20 14:27:00,260,"Go green?  Hows this for a start:  Stop removing all the big fish, putting them all in one boat and dropping them all off at one spot in the water.  I know they ""drop"" the fish at different places during the events but those big fish never have a chance to return where they came from.  Everytime there is a tournament on the tri-lakes (Chemong, Upper Buckhorn and Pigeon) the lakes are a right off and I don't want to be anywhere near it.  A very unpleasant experience every time for locals.  Maybe limit the number of entrants per event?  Just my $0.02.  Let the slamming begin"
332525,misfish,2009-04-20 15:32:00,29133," That would mean, rising the entry fee to make the winnings worth while. Dont see that happening.Entry fees IMO are already getting out of hand.   I dought anyone will slam you."
332537,bigugli,2009-04-20 15:51:00,6138,Some tournies do have a registration cap on the number of boats.
332557,ld17,2009-04-20 16:34:00,319,Ok if you want to go green and have a tournament then no gas powered motors.  Enough said  About power and speed....isn't there a story about a tortoise and hare.
332563,POLLIWOGG,2009-04-20 16:51:00,835,"about 90% of your motors energy is used to push the water out of your way creating the wake. If you have enough motor to lift the boat out of the water all of the energy goes into moving the boat creating little to no wake = more efficient. So we all need bigger motors.  Or you go so slow as to not break your displacement speed which is also more efficient, we could get by with about a 7.5hp . Some of the tourny guys might run 50 miles to get to a fishing spot, so it would take 10 or 12 hours round trip if they don't stop to fish."
332646,lookinforwalleye,2009-04-20 20:19:00,4399," I would love to see a totally green tournament how about we get guys like Dave Mercer, Bob Izumi etc. get them some 20 foot rowboats slap some sponsor decals all over them and let them go. I see it as a win win the boys would get some excersize and the earth wins with a little less pollution for a day or two. I would love to see a ""blast off"" in row boats I`d pay to see that.  Of course we would have a St.John`s Ambulance boat on hand for any emergency that may arise."
332660,Joeytier,2009-04-20 20:39:00,3990,"Of course you can say bigger motors are less harmful now than smaller motors were many years ago, but increased boat size equates to bigger motors, which in turn leads to bigger vehicles typically being needed to tow the boats, which is definitely not as efficient.  I find it shocking how apathetic the fishing community is towards being eco-friendly in terms of fuel consumption, yet are very concerned about habitat conservation."

332834,BassAsin,2009-04-21 01:18:00,806,only if it involves some rapids or waterfalls! then i'd pay to watch the blast off.
332843,lookinforwalleye,2009-04-21 01:32:00,4399," You probably use more fuel in that hour than the average fisherman trolling with his 9.9 4 stroke uses in a month or so. Add to that that you are probably on the water more than the average fisherman.  I myself have a 90 4 stroke which most of the time is over kill, I could probably get by with a 9.9 80 percent of the time so I am just as guilty as everbody else when it comes to wasting gas."

332856,iCarp,2009-04-21 01:43:00,50,"This has certainly been an interesting and thought provoking read about an issue that I do feel needs to be discussed.  I was gobsmacked last year to see WFN's 'Go Green' month featuring brief blubs in between the usual footage of fast, powerful boats, trailers, and electronics.  Seemed a bit contradictory to me to watch a few minutes about Trout Unlimited and then several hours of FLW and such.  Tournaments certainly don't project a green image of the sport.  And as anglers, we might want to be concerned about that.  Not only is there the environmental cost- what damage might be done by runnin' and gunnin' to habitat and shoreline, for example, and the damage done by the production of fossil fuels- which can affect the future of our fisheries, but there are other concerns as well.  For example, is there a link between the fact that the number of anglers in North America continues to decline every year and the image of fishing as a big toys, loud noise, big bucks sport that is promoted by many fishing programmes and magazines?  In other words, fishing is increasing portrayed as a complicated and expensive pastime that isn't in touch with nature all that much.  Maybe that's why fewer and fewer people are picking up a rod.  Personally, I like the idea of the float tube tournament, as long as the ambulances are on standby.  But what about shore fishing tournies?  Why not scatter the competitors along the shore of Lake Simcoe and seeing what they can catch?  Just a few random thoughts."

332891,Mike the Pike,2009-04-21 03:22:00,3421, Mark I think you made a good point you run your motor far less than other fisherman.  BTW I just happen to have a shot of some Bozos trolling in a canoe November 2006 in the Bay of Quinte Adolphus Reach.  Ask Wayne if he remembers these folks?

332908,Drew_10,2009-04-21 03:52:00,111,"This is an interesting topic.  There are a number of different schools of thought that arise.  The engine size / horsepower debate, in my opinion, is a pretty obvious target to single out againt many other aspects of fishing that are not so 'green'.  For example:  Do we really need Rapala Shad Raps available in 20 different colours?  Do we really need Strike King Spinnerbaits with multiple blade/colour options?  Do we as anglers really need Berkely to make 4 or 5 different types of soft-plastic stick baits?  Realize it or not, but these questions I pose are extremely similar to the engine/hp debate.  The amount of resources that goes into creating these elaborate product lines that we all purchase is amazing.  The engine size debate is singled out because of the non-renewable resource connection (OIL).  However, literally any tackle, sonar device, gps, trolling motor, boat wax, etc, requires non-renewable resources to produce at one capacity or another.  Therefore, before you judge someone because of the size of the engine they run or the vehicle they use to tow their boat, take a look at your tackle box or your 'smaller' boat and do the math.  Do we need 250hp rangers, probably not, but do we need lead weights from 1/32oz to 1oz in 1/16 oz increments?   We definitly do not.  But we buy them to help us catch fish and to be the best we can.  Ultimatley, its an industry.  Mercury has found a market for their 300hp engines, and as long as they sell they will continue producing them.  In my experiance, some of the most active-minded conservationists are the BASS guys who run the 250's and put in 100+ days on the water.  They may run their 'overkill' engines, but in the end they are also the ones (amongst others) who put in the time working with communities and wildlife managers to ensure fisheries are kept in quality condition.  This might not always be the case, but more often than not is it.  Just my opinion.  Good Fishing.  -Drew"

332935,musky_man,2009-04-21 10:36:00,159,"I am glad that this topic generated some good comments.  I am sorry if if I offended some - cetainly not my intention, but I really felt that it was something that needed to be talked about.  It certainly gave me a different perspective about some things I had not thought of and that can only be good.  At some point in the not so distant future I'll likely be in the position of upgrading my rig, and to some degree that is what prompted the original post -- what I wanted vs what I needed and what impact that might have now and for the future.  I must admit it is very hard to resist all the bells and whistles.  Like many of you, I've worked hard for most of my life and at the end of it you want to feel that you have earned the right to get whatever the h&ll you please ... but that got me thinking about all that that meant.  In the end, I am not sure what the heck I'll do -- I have saved, quite literally, for 25 years for the big toy, but now when it comes to buying it, I am not sure that it really needs to be what I envisioned 25 years ago -- I guess that comes with getting a bit older and maybe less inclined to be swayed by the the creating the illusion of being a decent fisherman vs the reality of being one -- not that they can't co-exist to some degree (but they cetainly don't aways co-exist), but I have done quite well with just the basics.  And I am certainly not saying that those with the big toys are not great fisherman/woman ... I suspect (know) many could fish me into oblivion ... but they could likely do that from a 14 tinny too!  I do know that I want a windshield -- the tiller is something I love for the space, but it is darn cool come October!  I want something that 3 can fish  out of comfortably ... a very basic fish finder, more for depth reading than locating fish ... and something I can take company out for a tour.  Beyond that, just give me some maps and I am fine.  Going to be a 4 stroke or E-tech, but smaller than I originally envisioned.  Likely add a small trolling motor as well.  In any event, I just wanted to kind of explain the genesis of this thread - thanks to those who commented; I am glad to see that it generate some great thought provoking feedback for all to consider."
332211,musky_man,2009-04-20 01:17:00,159,"I was looking at how the size of boats and motors has increased over the years.  I recall walking along Gerogian Bay years ago with my dad (maybe 1961-62) and we were looking at the ""large "" boats ... large in those days was 60 horsepower.  Anyway, I think the whole thing has gotten way out of hand.  Do we really need 300HP boats to go fishing - or even 100 for that matter.  I am certainly not going to be judge and jury as to what one ""needs"" but in saying all of this, would it not make sense that as custodians of the great outdoors we rethink what it is we really need to do what we love.  So - that led me to the idea of a green tournament.  All participants could bring whatever boat/motor combo they wanted, but they would only get so many gallons of gas/day and when it ran out, they were done.  Makes sense to me.  Perhaps even limit speed too, except in times of emergency, like getting off the water for bad storm.  Perhaps add bonus weight for gas remaining at the end of the tournament.  Anyone else have any ideas on how we could ""green"" tournaments?  I think this needs to be talked about -- I am not going to be amused when the boat that is screaming past me to catch a largemouth bass, in say 2019, has 900 HP and is going 200KPH... and trust me they will if some sanity does not prevail!"
332215,BassAsin,2009-04-20 01:23:00,806,"i bet running 10 gallons of gas through a new 100HP motor puts less emissions into the air then half that much gas burnt in a 1970 9.9   motors have come a long way to be ""green""  if the case of gas remaining is bonus in the tourny i'll be fishing with my boat tied to the dock all day!   Sounds fun!"
332216,BillM,2009-04-20 01:23:00,17367,Aren't some of these new big HP engines getting great mileage when they aren't WFO compared to the old oil burners of the past?  Just because it has 300hp doesn't mean you need to use it all at once
332230,musky_man,2009-04-20 01:38:00,159,"Bill,  No doubt some of the new 300HP are getting better mileage -- but not as good as the equivalent 100HP new motors -- and that is part of the issue.  The fuel saving that would have been realized in cars due to better design over the lat 30 years, have all but been lost as they keep getting bigger.  It isn't just about saving gas, I have to believe that in some ecosystems (smaller ones) these things are doing some damage just due to their shear power.   And safety is another issue (and probably another topic) but where I fish, in some parts of the water, there is not a lot of space and I have seen some clowns going what I would guess is 100KPH, and darn near hitting others.  I don't think you can ""green"" stupidity, but I'd love to try!  Let me ask you the question in another way -- how big is too big in your mind?  500HP ... 700?  I never thought when I was walking along that beach in 1962 that we would ever see engines of 300HP ... tht's 5 times bigger than the biggest (at 60HP) 40 years ago.        "
332233,kickingfrog,2009-04-20 01:40:00,8333,"Interesting points. Engines are getting more efficient, however the tournaments have an Formula 1 race feel to them. Meaning, it's not about the angler but the technology he has purchased or been sponsored by.  Tournaments are about money. Big purses for the anglers, product placement for the sponsors etc. The engine makers, and the boats they push, are big players behind that money, might be a tough go."
332238,danbouck,2009-04-20 01:44:00,4380,It's the same as cars. Do we really need to have 300HP in our cars? If I had the money I would have a 300 horse motor on the back of my boat and I would have 500HP in my tow vehicle. I believe in tourneys you want the power to get to the other side of the lake as fast as you can so you have more time to fish.  But right now I'm happy with my fuel efficient 50HP four stroke.
332245,nancur373,2009-04-20 01:47:00,1211, Yeah. Just use 150 on the way out and the other 150 on the way back...lol

Our 1988 26' Tempest (identical to a searay) with full birth/head/kitchen had a 5.7 Merc Cruiser in it... it did 43 MPH and we water skiied behind it even. As many have said.. the newer technology is much cleaner. My 275 Verado burns less fuel for similar speeds than my 2004 Johnson 2 stroke 115HP did and without the oil smoke.....heck that thing burnt more fuel idling/trolling than my Verado does at 30 MPH.

332326,Mike the Pike,2009-04-20 03:09:00,3421,In 2019 the price of gas may make us choose smaller .Who knows what the future holds.  On a fishing trip in 2004 there was someone in our group who had a 10hp Evinrude from 1962 everyday it was sucking more gas than my 50hp Honda.Believe me the bugs were not biting him those old motors sure let out alot of smoke.It did run well that old Evinrude.  If I could afford 300hp I sure wouldn't mind when one has to go 20 plus miles to fish on some days.  GCD made a good point we sure have come along way things have cleaned up compared to 30yrs ago.  BTW there is a green tournament every year someone on this board has a kayak tournament .  Just do a search it should turn up.can't get greener than that.

332347,Dara,2009-04-20 03:28:00,3052,"  Ummm...Yes, you do, thats why you have it   My tow vehicle is 400HP, and I use that all at once too"
332363,bigfish1965,2009-04-20 04:03:00,3382,"I don't think have varied classes is a bad idea....Under 125hp, under 60hp and Open. I bet the people on Rice Lake would rather see a bunch of 90's and 125's running around during the tournies. Plus it does become a keep up with the jonses thing, make it a bit more level..about the fishing and not the boat."

332380,OhioFisherman,2009-04-20 06:39:00,6623,"Our bass club had limited areas for some tournaments, we fished a number of them on back bays of Lake Erie here in Ohio. All the bays had access to Lake Erie so it prevented the guy with the fastest boat to have an advantage over slower boats. You were not allowed to go out or past a certain point and enter the main lake. You had to fish, not run.  In my mind money has in some ways corrupted the sport, kind of like an arms race. You do have to remember it`s all about them money, some came up with the idea to make money. If they don`t follow the path the sponsers want followed no or limited revenue. Obviously Merc or whomever makes more money selling a 250HP than a 60 HP motor, a 20 bassboat brings them more revenue than a 17 footer.  Another sad part of it is it takes a lot of people out of the competition, they can`t afford to compete with the big boys and have to become spectators, which I feel is the wrong direction for the sport. The idea should be to get people to fish, not watch other people do it.  Sort of lucky here in Ohio I guess, some smaller 1000 acre or so city water supply reserviors that are electric motor only, some lakes with a low horsepower limit, like 10 hp so there are a variety of options at least for bass.  Guess it just depends on what you call fun."
