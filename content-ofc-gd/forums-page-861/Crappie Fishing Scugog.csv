333037,GoneFishin,2009-04-21 15:02:00,349,"Hi everyone! Next weekend I was thinking of going down to scugog for some crappie, after trout opener of course lol. I've never caught a crappie and this year I plan on fishing for some. So I was wondering if any one knows of any good shore fishing spots for fishing for them? What should I use for bait? I was planning on buying a dozen or so pin head minnows but I would rather learn how to fish them with artifical bait. I've got some micro jigs 1""-2"" twister tales, cray fish, tubes, gulp fish fry/minnows, some 3"" senkos and some powerbait maggots and grubs. Will a lot of the crappie be in close to shore or will they be suspeneded in deeper water? Any help would be appreciated."
333043,Stoty,2009-04-21 15:13:00,2910,"Grab a couple slip floats, and you're set!  Put about a 3-5 ft bobber stop on your line, and drag your soft plastics under the float, and hang on!  The fish should be up in the shallows, around 3-8ft of water.  If you're limited to the shore, then I suggest going around dusk."
333049,GBW,2009-04-21 15:30:00,8460,gust don't fish the causeways as it's a sanctuary still.
333060,e-z-out,2009-04-21 15:43:00,1052,Try road runners they work great.
333063,crappieperchhunter,2009-04-21 15:47:00,2582,You will do fine with plastic. For shallow spring crappie I generally fish about 2 ft off bottom. So if you are in 3 FOW you only need a 1 foot lead under the float.  Try that spot closer to home that you and I talked about on the Creek this spring. You might be surprised...but keep it on the down low  Good luck at getting into them. It's supposed to be a beauty weekend.
333093,Laker272,2009-04-21 17:27:00,45,"Remember that crappie feed looking up. This means short leader from your float. If you have 3 ft under your float you will only catch Sunfish and perch, make sure your presentation is in the top 1/3 of the water column."
