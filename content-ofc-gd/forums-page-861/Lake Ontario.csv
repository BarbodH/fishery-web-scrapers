333527,greg1983,2009-04-22 17:29:00,20,Got out oat Jordan Harbour for a few hours in the morning.  We Caught a couple of fish trolling.   We went 2/3 in 3 hours of fishing.  Water temp was 44 F.  Good to get the salmon skunk out of the boat.   The biggest was about 17.5.    We got this lamprey off of it and released her.
