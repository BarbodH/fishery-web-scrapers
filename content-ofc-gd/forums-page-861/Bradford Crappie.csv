333313,batoathome,2009-04-22 02:01:00,47,"hit Keswick Thurs, Fri and Sunday  lots of little guys had to work hard for the slabs.   Things were definitely slowing down by Sunday so that was my last trip there this year.  Hoping Rice will be good this year, but it will be a mad house this weekend.   Here is a few from Friday past.  only kept a dozen  the rest were released. "
333315,Georgeinbrisbane,2009-04-22 02:04:00,5,Thanks for the PM terrry.  Nice picture I actually caught a nice largemouth at East holland river about 4 pounds and send him back to his home immediately. Probably the biggest bass this year
333334,mikeh,2009-04-22 03:08:00,824,Do the crappie live in the holland river all year or just go there to spawn?
333386,Terry,2009-04-22 10:14:00,14456,"most of them just start moving into the river as the ice melts but without a doubt some live there year round and that's why I don't eat any I catch  in the river  but if you do catch one that live there  take it home and save it   when the power goes out grab it with 2 hands and snap it to a 90  deg bend then shake it hard, it works great as a night light for about six hours because of the phosphates in it    ok I made that part up"
