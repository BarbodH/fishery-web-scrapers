My wife calls it my ""talk to the lake season""....lol......its true....i talk to the lake willing it to melt.........is that wrong?, dont answer that...lol.   Anyhoo, there is still probably good ice out there......in some spots, but i aint as brave/stupid at the end of the year as i am at the beginning, i just dont trust melting ice.   I was gonna go for some lakers this afternoon, but after a quick trip to the bottom of the yard and a look at the ice, i was surprised to find it so far gone. Still obviously thick ice there, but a good 20 yards  of really crappy ice around the margin changed my mind about heading onto a deep trout lake by myself......overcautious?...dont think you can be personally.   I was further convinced when speaking to the gas pump attendant in town, he said his buddy went to Gullwing lake for lakers 3 days ago....fine going out on the 4 wheeler, but coming back  10' of  open water where it had been solid(ish) that morning, had to just pin it down and scoot across apparently.   Soooo......the watch and wait game begins..........   Was a beautiful morning here this morning    THE WAIT BEGINS         DEFINTELY NOT LONG NOW                   SPRING IS IN THE AIR            "

333597,trapshooter,2009-04-22 19:54:00,1234,Keep willing that ice to melt... I need it gone by May 3rd!!

333606,Sinker,2009-04-22 20:03:00,8692,I already went through the inbetween season down here.  4th trip in the boat today    Sinker
333740,Leecher,2009-04-22 23:32:00,7832,"I know how you feel Simon    went through the same thing over here but now, waiting for trout opener..... just can't get here soon enough  You made a good decision to stay off of it     I'm like you.... just don't trust it. Like others said.... patience my good friend.... it'll melt pretty fast  Hang in there mate!!! Jacques"
333768,Rizzo,2009-04-23 00:52:00,4754,"yes its a tough time of year. I hope to get the boat in the water soon for a test run, but then it likely won't get into the water again before mid june, or maybe even Lakair at the end of June."
