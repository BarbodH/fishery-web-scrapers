Hit Fishmasters in Dunnville around two, a few others around but not alot happening.  Left just after the sun went down, so around seven hours, litre of coffee, half a pack of cigarettes and one cigar. A few nibbles but it was consistently slow, but I bagged my first cat AND I remembered the camera.    Decent enough size, a little north of 15lb. What bites there were came on shrimp or fresh sucker bait."
