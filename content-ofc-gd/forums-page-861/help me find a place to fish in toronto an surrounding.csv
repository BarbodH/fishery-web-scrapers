I was wondering if anybody can steer me to a place where I can will have better luck getting fish, sheepshead, channel cats whatever! I dont really care.....  I heard dunnville dam for cats, but what would I use to be successful?  I am located in toronto and would like to catch some species I normally dont target.....  another question couple of questions as well, is trout officially open now? When does Pike open also? And I have seen people fish by the first little dam at marie curtis park in etobicoke creek....is there any fish there ever?  thank you very much in advance!"

Mainly because theres allot of begginers who troll on this board like little rats, espetially from Toronto area. Best advice I can offer for you: http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/ then click the MyTopo button on the map. Try to find some water close to where you are and go from there.  Do you have a boat? Canoe? Kayak? Vehicle?  Goto the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources website, or a local store that sells fishing licences. They have the fishing regulations there. Ive seen a couple people asking about the regs before on here recently, maybe the mods need to make a stickey of them because its getting a bit mind boggling how people will fish, but yet they cannot tell you what open or closed, how many they are allowed to keep, how many hooks they are allowed to use, how many poles they are allowed to use, ect ect ect ect ect ect ect."
332543,Nippissinger,2009-04-20 15:59:00,53,"Not quite sure what you normally target, but most of the creeks, stream and rivers running into the Great Lakes are steamin with fish.  As to Trout seasons, that all depends where you want to fish..  All the Great Lakes most species are open ALL year...  Now the rivers are different. Check here for Regulations  Good Luck and Enjoy Ontario's waterways...  Nipper"
332559,iCarp,2009-04-20 16:40:00,50,"If you don't mind trying some new species, as you say, there is some good carp fishing.  Over all, because of the water rats posting 'where can I catch lots of fish' posts on local boards, as xeon mentioned, the best way to find out what's going on is to get out fishing and talk to guys.  I fish from Lake Simcoe down through the Niagara region and getting out there on the water has been the best way to meet people and learn."
332595,fishermccann,2009-04-20 18:43:00,655,"I do agree that most fisherpersons are more likely to give good info. if you talk to them ""on the water' as compaired to a website."
332624,ben306,2009-04-20 19:23:00,59," hey, careful what your saying  lol  I my be a newbie to the board asking about areas in Toronto, but its only cos Im not there yet to find out for myself haha.  Im far from being a little rat or beginner. Got 20 years fishing under my belf and if I can fish well and constantly do well in competitions in the UK Im betting I can adapt out there.  Anyhow, only pulling your chain, just after a head start as to where to head"
332748,xeon,2009-04-20 22:58:00,350," Dont worry, No offense taken.  And the rats dont make any posts. Theres a reason why people blur the backgrounds of the photos on here."
332918,ben306,2009-04-21 06:41:00,59,"Ahh got you. Well if anyone does want to drop me any pointers feel more than welcome to PM me. Or even better if you dont mind me tagging along at some point, get to know a few of you!"
