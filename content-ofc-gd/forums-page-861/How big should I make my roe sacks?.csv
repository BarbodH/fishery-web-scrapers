332777,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-21 00:01:00,10439,Totally depends on water conditions. Clear=dime sized Dirty=nickle to quarter sized
332784,Joeytier,2009-04-21 00:11:00,3990,That sums it up perfectly.  Roll some up even smaller than a dime if the water conditions are low and clear.
332803,BillM,2009-04-21 00:43:00,17367,"I have used quarter/looney sized bags since December, lol...  Clear, dirty, didn't really matter.  The stink trail they put out is great.  If you are fishing dropbacks, you want as big of a scent trail as possible."
332833,justin elia,2009-04-21 01:15:00,151,"DD, In dirty water(12 inches or less), I tie nickel/quarter size bags in bright mesh In water that has 12 inches to 3 feet of vis, I tie nickel/dime size bags in all colours In clear water more than 3 feet of vis, I tie dime size or very small bags in light coloured mesh, maybe about 5-7 trout eggs.  Keep in mind, that when fishing for pressured steelies, to not only have roe but to bring flies, jigs, soft plastics etc.  Good luck  J"
332877,Garnet,2009-04-21 02:45:00,2056,"Back 25 years ago when I trout fish 16hrs x 365 (had to work 8hrs) some days, roe bags to match what I was going to fish today and tomorrow was all I though about.  Now that I'm not that intense I tie 3-5 dsize 3-5 nicsize 3-5 qsize and maybe 2 golf ball with Blackbird floaters just in case I pier fish in the next week or 2.  So I'm sort of ready for just about anything and some were in that mess I call a trout vest is a small kit Spider Thread bag tie maybe 15 squares Blackbird spawn net and a very little bag of spawn floaters (looks just like some that e lee gale product) really just colored Styrofoam from my younger days ""maybe I should check""   The point is   just be ready for 70-80% and make it work if you need something else worms flyes micro crank.  Or just obsessive! not me  Garnet"
332890,KelfuN,2009-04-21 03:20:00,246,"logically, the guys posts above are all correct..  but I've had 2-3lb fish taking quarter size bags on gin clear water.. the best was hooking a 12lb steel in chocolate milk with dime size bag (3-4 salmon roe). i think i was just lucky?!haha  just have all varieties ready for the day. different size bags, different colour bags...you just don't know what they will hit that day!"
