229318,Mike the Pike,2008-07-18 04:18:00,3421,Yup like Cliff said you have to see the Capilano suspention bridge.  Go see the Salmon hatchery just outside Vancouver worth it Stan I enjoyed it.  Get up to Whistler Blackomb Mountain 7th heaven.  Mount Baker in Washington USA worth the Drive.  Nanaimo on Vancouver Island.See the huge trees a must.  Wax Museum in Victoria.  Kitsalano Beach.  Have to eat the Ribs at Dem bones Restaurant In Vancouver.  Alberta go to see Hoo Doos and Dinasaur museum.  Moraine lake  Lake Louise a must see.  Stan you need 3 weeks Buddy so much to see.  Have a good time

229374,Tarzan's Jane,2008-07-18 11:44:00,1183,"Wow...great family trip you are planning...I agree with taking 3 weeks.  Did the drive many years ago...you must see Banff...majestic and awesome are our Rockies....I would also consider a day at the Edmonton Mall (probably cuz I wanna go there     Bring lots of movies (hopefully you have a DVD player in the vehicle)...have the kids look for a purple cow, first kid to spot one gets a $1.00....worked on us  haha Safe trip."
229375,Victor,2008-07-18 11:44:00,1609,"I have never done it a trip like that but as others said it seems that 2 weeks is very short considering all the driving that you'll need to do. My family went to Banff national park last year, they flew over there by plane and rented a car to tour around. Just visiting the national park alone they spent about 7 days. Of course you won't be doing as much/going as deep into the park for the purpose of your trip but it seems that there are still lots of ""must-visit"" places to cover.  I agree with Moosebank, missing a few days of school is nothing for the little ones ... i'd say even grade 9-10 it wouldn't be such a big problem.... especially the first week of school ,it's always slow anyway."
229419,davew3,2008-07-18 13:15:00,430,"I just got back from Banff last week.  I was only there for a couple of hours but while there I called my wife and said, ""we have to come back here for a weeks holidays"". If you can, take the extra time. Your children are young and will need breaks out of the van to stay happy.  Have fun."
229469,wuchikubo,2008-07-18 14:25:00,1114," I'm going to use my MS streets and Maps with my laptop, thus I can access the web at some of the places we stay at to make sure all is okay at work too and possibly post along the way.   My wife and I have been to the West Edmonton Mall, big mall but with too many repetitive stores. My wife went through the entire mall in 3/4 of a day while I was booked in for a 3 day conference. I don't think we'll stop at the mall this time  but thanks for the idea. I can hook up my laptop and play DVD movies for them.   That and I think I'll borrow my relative's portable camping potty."
229490,BillM,2008-07-18 15:35:00,17367,I have a Garmin StreetPilot C330 that I'd be more then happy to lend you for the trip if needed.  Updated with the latest 2008 maps..  Just let me know.
229503,ffej,2008-07-18 16:23:00,14,I made the trip a few years back.  You may want to start out by taking the Manitoulin ferry across to hook up with the transcanada.   that should be fun for the kids.  Spend some time in Lake Superior Provincial park as well.
229506,keram,2008-07-18 16:57:00,585,"What about Banff and Jasper and everything in between.?  Type ""Banff"" in search. If I remember correctly there are three threads with lots of pictures from my trip last year. see if you like it there"
229528,wuchikubo,2008-07-18 17:59:00,1114," Thanks Bill for the offer, however the last thing I need on my mind is worrying about having it lost or damaged. I'll just stick with my laptop and MS Streets and trips.    Marking another one up for the ferry ride, thanks.   Thanks Keram, I did a shorter edmonton via jasper-banff to calgary trip 5 years ago. Banff to Jasper was a beautiful drive I did 5 years ago with my wife and then 3 year son too. If time permits, I'll have it in the plans as well. Missed the Dino park last time, and will have to do it this time around."

229531,wuchikubo,2008-07-18 18:00:00,1114,BTW anyone know about the regs to fishing BC or the prairie provinces? And how I may be able to obtain a fishing license for those provinces?
229534,ccmtcanada,2008-07-18 18:05:00,7971, Here are the regs for freshwater fishing. http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/fw/fish/regulations/#Synopsis  Looks like you can get a freshwater license online....so you can have it in hand before you leave.... http://www.fishing.gov.bc.ca/
229565,bpsbassman,2008-07-18 19:06:00,941," Totally agree with MB.  My son has taken his kids out of school for up to two weeks to Florida every year.  They always have the teachers blessing saying they will learn more on their trip than in school......and that's for Florida!!  Take it while you can Stan, they don't give those years back."
229571,suds,2008-07-18 19:29:00,70,"BC has a lot of different fishing licences: Tidal, non-tidal and then species stamps for Chinook, Steelhead, or tidal species in Non-Tidal waters ( i.e. salmon fishing in the Fraser ). So make sure you get the right one and don't buy ones you may not need. The whole package to be 100% covered is over $100 bucks.  AB has one licence that you can pick up at Wal-Mart, but you need a WIN ( Wildlife ID number) card as well. You buy them both at the same time and when you get back in Ontario you will get the plastic card lol (it is good for life though). But you are good to fish right away.  Expect to pay a non resident premium for fresh water. Tidal is DFO controlled and is the same price for CDN citizens wherever they are.  PM me if you want more specific fishy info.  suds"

231762,JohnF,2008-07-23 19:55:00,3494," Great idea. That can be a really nice trip. Lots to see and not an horrifically long drive. Take the boat to Newfoundland and drive the causeway to PEI. Drive through the Gaspe. See the tides on the Bay of Fundy. Do some shore fishing and jigging. My wife's family did it for a number of summers when the kids were little, before the days of minivans. My wife still has great memories.  JF"

So I'm thinking of a Northern Ontario trip for a week or so at the moment.

Okay, now that the trip is confirmed for this year I'd like to know if anyone has any experience with any one day / half day saltwater charters? (in BC).  Disregard the original post from July 23: Thanks everyone for the input, it looks like we'll put the trip on hold for a year or two so we can plan out a more not-so-rushed trip.  Initial post: I haven't taken a vacation in a few years now and have decided this year I'll take two weeks off (mid Aug to end of aug) and take the family on a grand road trip from Toronto to Vancouver (possibly Victoria too) via our minivan.  I'd like to stay on the Canadian side of things to give the kids an idea of Canada (but may consider using the US route on the way back).  I would like to see if there are any suggestions on which places are definite ""don't miss"" spots along the way there and back. Although I would love to meet up with OFNers on the way, I'm not sure how much my wife will put up with me if I get side tracked too much  . I'll be bringing at least one fishing rod for sure.  And Yes, some have called be nuts for going when the gas prices are this high, but I figure, next year it'll be higher, so best do it now.  So far this is what I have planned (it's in the early stages and not much but plans can always change).   Alberta: Dino graveyard BC: Banff, Whistler (possibly), Vancouver, Victoria.    Thanks for any input,  Stan"
228969,ccmtcanada,2008-07-17 16:59:00,7971,"When I was about 10 years old, my family flew out to BC, where my dad bought a company car and we drove it home to Toronto.  While in Vancouver, we visited the Capilano Suspension Bridge, the Vancouver Sea Aquarium, Grouse Mountain....and Whistler.  Having a snowball fight in July was pretty cool.  Our travels then took us to the Okanagan Valley (Kelowna), where they had some friends.  Visited the Flintstone's Theme Park (no longer there), and learned about the Ogopogo...Canada's Loch Ness Monster.  After that we drove to Jasper and rented a chalet for a few days....it was pretty cool there.  From there we visited the Columbia Icefields on the way to Banff.  That was awesome!  Got to go out on snowmobile buses right on the glaciers there.  Once in Banff, we went to the Sulpher Hot Springs and Lake Louise.  It was a blur from there....we drove straight from Banff to Thunder Bay in one day.  Left Thunder Bay and saw the Big Nickel Mine Tours in Sudbury before heading home.  All in all, it was an AMAZING trip.  I was only 10...my younger brother was 8 and my older brother was 14 at the the time.  We were never bored, it was an awesome time."

228972,JohnF,2008-07-17 17:07:00,3494,"I think it's a great time for a trip like that. A lot of folks will be put off by high gas prices so the hotels and restaurants (or campgrounds) will be less busy, and perhaps even cheaper. In reality, how much extra will gas actually cost you anyway? Say 9000 kliks round trip - an extra $150 tops over last year, unless yer mileage is really awful? You might save that in reduced accommodation costs.  We used to head off on trips like that with our guys with little more decided than which direction we were going. They always worked out fine.  Have fun.  JF"

I think I slept most of the trip, but I do recall seeing a traffic jam on the highway in the prairies due to a cow dead on the side of the trans-canada highway.  Those were some great suggestions, I'll have to look it up and consider adding them in to the plans. Thanks.   Thanks John, it was kind of what you mentioned with the lower traffic that has me thinking it might just work out fine.

228989,muskymike,2008-07-17 17:48:00,772,"Hey Stan, I did this trip about 4 years ago. Went through the states though on the way there, canada on the way back.  Here are some things to see on the way if you go the states route, which is far far better then the canadian route?  Started in Hamilton:  Day 1: Drove through Detroit then Indy then through Chicago. First night stayed in Maddison WI.  Day 2: up to St. Paul Minn, and Mall of America. HUGE Mall. about 6 times the size of square one. a 2 hour detour will get you to Lambeau Field and ROLLIE and HELENS Musky Shop (before Mall of america) Then from Mall of America we went to Mitchell South Dakota. Home of the Corn Palace. (look it up) Also in Mitchell, Cabelas. Day 2 stayed in Souix Falls SD.  Day 3: Across south dakota to THE BADLANDS. Simply amazing. Hidalgo was filmed there. From the Badlands, hit Wall Drug. If you dont know what wall drug is look it up. Neat to see, but kinda odd. Also the Dances with Wolves museum is there. Expensive but again need to see. From there you head into the Black Hills of South Dakota. We went to Mount Rushmore, then Crazy Horse, the Hair Pin Hwy was closed (only open till 6PM or something) but supposed to be AMAZING. Then on the way out of the Black hills there is Deadwood. What a town to see. The original Deadwood. NOTE: before hitting the Badlands you drive for about 10 miles of nothing but Sunflowers. A sight to see on its own. No man made structure other then the Hwy and sunflowers. Day 3 ended in Gillette Wyoming.  Day 4: The Devils Tower of Wyoming. Again look it up. its so amazing. Off through the Buckhorn Mountains and into Cody Wyoming, the home of the Midwest Bullriding. From there, the East Gate of Yellowstone National. If you go this way, Take a COMPLETE day for Yellowstone. There is just far too much in that park to see and it is worth the drive for sure. From Yellowstone you head north into Montana where Day 4 Ended and we stayed in Livingston.  Day 5 we drove to GOING TO THE SUN ROAD. Okay let me just say this, if you have not been on Going to the Sun Road, Go now as they are planning its closure and it was probably the best part of the trip. A 2 hour drive up and down a 7000 ft mountain with breathtaking scenery and NO guardrails. End of Day 5 we were in Fort McCloud. A dump if you ask me.  Day 6: Crowsnest Past and the Frank Slide. Another MUST SEE. as well as Head smashed in buffalo jump. Then north to Calgary, Olympic Stadium and then into Banff and The Glacier Fields then up to Jasper for the end of Day 6.  That drive was simply incredible. there are so many things to see and do and I would do it again in a heartbeat if i could.  I hope this helps."

229008,wuchikubo,2008-07-17 18:04:00,1114," Thanks Mike,  That sounded like a blast. The only thing that may make me consider a state side trip is if my passport (which I haven't used in quite some time) is still valid, but first I have to dig it up and check it. lol. The new border crossing rules are a deterrent for me, as I don't like long line ups.  I've been leaning more on the Canadian side of things as my wife is already has a pro-USA perception (thinks it's boring here) and would like to show her that Canada has many good things too.

229026,John,2008-07-17 18:35:00,2956,  Absolutely right........not sure how much of a vacation it would be and how much you would see other than a hotel room and the inside of the minivan.  You would need to average 100km/hr for 7 hours/day x 7 days/week x 2 = 9800kms....you are a brave man!
229035,ccmtcanada,2008-07-17 18:59:00,7971,Yeah...now that people mention it....we spent 2 weeks on the trip one way.
229039,SlowPoke,2008-07-17 19:11:00,2984,"As others have suggested, you really should add at least another week to the trip. Just the ""can't miss"" attractions in British Columbia alone could eat up a week... esp. if you intend on hitting Victoria.  One of the things I hate most about the drive through Canada is being in Ontario for ""three sleeps"". This could put a real drag on the trip once your kids wake up for the third time and say ""Are we still in Ontario?"". If you MUST do the Canada side, do it on the way home.  You won't miss much bypassing Ontario-Saskatchawan but I think it would be worth the extra driving to go through Alberta into BC. as this map shows.  http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&....107422&z=4"

229099,rowingsunny,2008-07-17 21:14:00,11,I remember doing the same trip with my brother and dad when I was twelve and it was a lot of fun.  We camped it from Ontario to BC usually staying in KOA campgrounds.  I noticed for Saskatchewan you dont have anything listed yet.  We stayed right at the RCMP recruit depot.  They have a campground right on sight and they offer full tours.  I think it would be something your kids would find interesting. Enjoy the holidays

I'd pull my kids out of elementary school for 3 weeks for a trip like this with them.  Seriously, if you extend your time to a realistic 3 weeks that allows you to actually stop and take a pi$$ now and then, and check out a site or two, well... this in my opinion is every bit as much or more of a learning experience than what they'll get out of a few missed days at school.  It's funny, I find so many parents locked into the mindset that if their kids miss a little school that their whole precious little worlds will fall apart and they'll forever be trying to catch up.  It's bullocks... the parents and kids actually lose out because of missed opportunity.  So it's the first day of school... they'll be about 11 or 12 years of first days of school.  March Break, Summer Break, Christmas Break... None of them are any break at all for the parent.  Take your vacation Hearingfish.  Take as much of it as you can, make as much out of it as you can.  Show your kids that mom and dad can teach them a thing or two about the big world as well.  Don't stress yourself out with a tight 2 week trip that you may only ever get one chance in your life to do.  Be wise about this.  And for God's Sake... don't just drive Canada if you can help it.  My folks are near 60 now and they both just returned from a 3000 mile southern/eastern road trip on the Goldwing.  With two weeks they wished they had more time because of not only all the sites, but all the great folks they met in the U.S. while there.  Just my ...... $0.03"

Marathon Ontario night 3 was home on the 4th day.  We could have spent another 10 days EASILY.  Whatever you choose to do though, I would definitely recommend the USA trip as it was FAR FAR more exciting then the canadian side unfortunately."
