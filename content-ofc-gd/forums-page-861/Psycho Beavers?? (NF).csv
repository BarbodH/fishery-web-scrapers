332414,danc,2009-04-20 12:12:00,4677,"I've seen a lot of Beaver chewed trees in my days. But this one that I came across yesterday, tops them all. The Beaver(s) responsible for this should win some kind of award.  "

332424,Phil 65,2009-04-20 12:45:00,37,Maybe his momma never told him not to play with his food .LOL
332431,crappieperchhunter,2009-04-20 13:01:00,2582,Maybe that beaver owns a boat cause it sure looks like he was trying to fashion one of them anchoring buttons you tie your boat off on when you go ashore. At least thats what they look like along the Trent at some of the locks.
332434,JohnF,2009-04-20 13:04:00,3494, Musta been a young beaver. It just grew up as it chewed.  JF
332443,bigfish1965,2009-04-20 13:23:00,3382,Two different beavers...a yearling and an adult. Is a very artistic bit of work though. An adult would not try and chew that close to the root line.
332444,Stoty,2009-04-20 13:23:00,2910, Geesh for a second there I thought this post was about a few of my ex-girlfriends!!
332452,shane,2009-04-20 13:37:00,652,That's pretty cool.  But.........why would a beaver carve a statue of a nuclear bomb mushroom cloud?
332454,irishfield,2009-04-20 13:38:00,26272,Maybe it's a psychic beaver... not psycho.. and it's trying to tell us something.....
332461,TJQ,2009-04-20 13:48:00,7806, Oh dude......  Dan.. it would be great to get in there with a chainsaw and bring that natures artwork home!!
332462,danc,2009-04-20 13:48:00,4677, That's what I was thinking too Rick.
332467,danc,2009-04-20 13:51:00,4677," I was thinking that too TJ, but it is located in a conservation area and should be left there to be enjoyed by everyone."
332469,shane,2009-04-20 13:52:00,652,"  A psychic beaver?  Then,.... shouldn't he be cutting down palm trees?"
332530,ohhenrygsr,2009-04-20 15:37:00,947,Buh hahaha
332830,rockfish,2009-04-21 01:09:00,91,That's an awesome chewed tree pic and artistic.  There's getting to be more beavers around the Hammy harbour and at Lasalle park they've tied wire screening around the trees. Most destruction I've seen recently tho is around the Martindale pond in St Cath.
332845,solopaddler,2009-04-21 01:33:00,8605,Interesting. No doubt related to this crazed rodent:  http://richlabonte.net/exonews/xtra4/crazed_beaver.htm  
332857,Greencoachdog,2009-04-21 01:53:00,8163,"This is your normal Beaver tree damage:   This is tree damage caused by Beavers on Meth!!!   ... any questions?   ... have there been any houses or house trailers ""exploding"" in that area Dan???"
332869,Joey,2009-04-21 02:27:00,9122,"Hahahaha, that's fantastic Dan, are your teeth sore"
