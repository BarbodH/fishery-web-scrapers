333411,tinbanger,2009-04-22 12:46:00,1028,"It appears the house accross the street from us was the location for the most recent drug/gun bust in barrie!  GUN SEIZED The Barrie Police street crime, drug enforcement, guns and gangs, and tactical support units executed a warrant on a home on Tuesday.  Inside they discovered and seized a Glock 17 handgun, clip, ammunition and holster.  They also found a small amount of marijuana and cash.  A 29 year old man and 24 year old woman were both arrested and face several charges.  any one want to buy a house   All joking aside the guns part is no laughing matter. TB"
333440,ozaibak1,2009-04-22 14:18:00,401,"Wow, they found cash! And a bit of weed! Is that even relevant??? The gun I agree with, but a 'small amount' of marijuana and cash? Sounds like someones trying to over hype their bust as usual."
333444,tinbanger,2009-04-22 14:31:00,1028,"I got no probelm with the so called ""hype"" Like it or not Pot is illegal , the gun is what makes it more of a storey .. at least for barrie.    TB"
333451,Dara,2009-04-22 14:47:00,3052,"They never tell you if the gun was registered, and generally not what kind it was. In this case they have to splash GLOCK all over the place. It could very well have been legal. What were the charges. Not likely gun related. Or possibly the gun was locked up and a bullet was in an unlocked drawer so a charge of Unsafe storage of amunition would be in order.  Hey, I'm all for busting drug dealers, but I dislike trashing guns every chance they get."
333455,Guest gbfisher,2009-04-22 14:56:00,0,I'm sure your neighbour was fine before they found anything....... Ask them if they got their Gun returned.
333456,tinbanger,2009-04-22 14:57:00,1028,  Wanna bet?  But we may never hear for sure.  Gotta wonder why a half dozen cars show up and they bust the guys door down ? TB
333461,Jonaton,2009-04-22 15:07:00,72,Yeah a little bit of pot must be the problem not the guns
333466,tinbanger,2009-04-22 15:12:00,1028,  seems to be poplar neighorhood .  Another house down the street has been busted as a grow op twice! Always a bit of a shock when its close to home.  TB

333468,Dara,2009-04-22 15:14:00,3052,"  Naw, I don't mean to be like that. I live in an area where half the population owns guns. All the laws we have to abide by were made in an area that has gun problems.  If you bust a guy for real gun charges, lock him up. Make a few examples. There will be a lot less of a problem for the rest of us"
333470,Wendel,2009-04-22 15:25:00,213," Guns were never the problem, it was the gangs that started shootin' the place up that caused the issue. Of course since the gun registry has been put into effect gangsters are now taking the time to register their guns before they kill people...stats can prove it!"
333471,tinbanger,2009-04-22 15:25:00,1028, Couldn't agree more!  TB
333478,CLofchik,2009-04-22 15:38:00,854," Why do you irrationally fear inanimate objects? Green minivans scare me more than Glocks, because them and their drivers are more likely to kill me.   What he said."
333479,caper,2009-04-22 15:39:00,210,  Occurrence Type: Search Warrant â€“ Possession of an unregistered restricted hand gun. Occurrence #: BA09014963 Date: 21 April 2009   http://www.police.barrie.on.ca/node/2097
333483,tinbanger,2009-04-22 15:45:00,1028,"  Why do you fear green mini vans ? why not red ones ? why not buicks?  Oh its the driver that worries you !  I have no fear of the gun , its the person who has possession of a (alledged) unregistered/illegal handgun who worries me . Purpose of the gun ? I could guess but that wouldn't be fair now would it  My legal , registered guns have a purpose   No need to fear me .  TB"
333485,tinbanger,2009-04-22 15:51:00,1028, thanks for that link. TB
333513,Dara,2009-04-22 17:09:00,3052,  Perfect. Next I would like to see the sentence.  We had an occurence like that last year. Cocaine and guns. $500.00 fine for the cocaine. $400.00 fine for the unregistered loaded handgun hidden under his pillow.    If that ain't a deterent....well....
333587,misfish,2009-04-22 19:35:00,29133," You wouldnt want me living accross from you Dave.I would drive you insane with my blue box full of Tim cups.  That other house is the one on the corner right? Can believe there were two grow ops in that place, and they still sold it."
333637,Tybo,2009-04-22 20:50:00,1373,Sounds to me they followed the gun and found pot.
