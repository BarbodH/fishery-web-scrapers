333423,GBW,2009-04-22 13:13:00,8460," I have it in a milk crate with a wood top (the display is mounted on the wood) and the 12v is inside.  My Honda motor has an alternator adaptor so I bought the cable, this charges the 12v while the motor is running.  When I am not in the boat it goes in the boat house."
333613,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-22 20:07:00,10439,"If your finder is in the portable pack you can use the battery pack that it comes with. Just gets a little costly replacing batteries. I run my portable on a 7ah sealed lead acid rechargable battery. Similar to this: Battery and Charger    It even fits inside my portable case for my Garmin fishfinder. I had to do some tweaking with the portable housing for my Lowrance flasher though, but managed to get it to fit inside the housing."

333777,SBCregal,2009-04-23 01:01:00,688,"Drifter, how long does the fishfinder last on the 7ah battery? ive seen a few kayak fishing sites and that seems to be the size alot of guys are using.  will it last the day fishing? i assume that it would charge fully overnight?"
332004,SBCregal,2009-04-19 20:31:00,688,We've rented a cottage for the bass opener weekend on sturgeon lake and for the time we're there we'll be renting a boat from the place as well.  I have a fishfinder on my 12' tinny and i was hoping to be able to bring it up with us and mount it on the rental boat so we have one for the weekend.  What I am wondering is how i'll mount the transducer temporarily.  I was thinking of a piece of wood that i could clamp onto the transom in some manner.  does anyone have any other ideas?  Ryan

332102,SBCregal,2009-04-19 23:15:00,688,indeed....thanks wayne  i'll try and fab up something like that. gonna have to make it adjustable to some extent as i dont know the transom height on the boat we're getting.  thanks again
332105,irishfield,2009-04-19 23:23:00,26272,Just make a larger/wider top hoop.. weld a nut and a thumb screw.
332114,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-19 23:52:00,10439,Just bolt it to a board and clamp with a C clamp. If you position the board in the correct place you can run wide open and mark depth just like on your regular boat. Don't bother with those suction cup mounts. They can come off while running and if you forget to tie off a safety line the transducer and or the fishfinder can be damaged if the transducer comes off. A friend had this happen last year and he has to replace the transducer as it got caught in the prop.   Just set the depth of the board and clamp on.  
332119,adempsey,2009-04-19 23:57:00,1498,"Ya, I used the suction cup last season (with petroleum jelly).  It worked ok, but always came off eventually.  I decided to either get a wooden board and C-clamp or buy one of those aluminum rods with clamps that are available from BSP for about $40.  The board is probably a lot cheaper =)."
332122,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-20 00:04:00,10439,"  Yep, it cost me $6 for the C clamp at Princess Auto and the board was free.  I had one of the Tite Lok transducer mounts and it kept swinging up when running at speed. A waste of money IMO. It will work fine on my inflatable pontoon though."
332145,SBCregal,2009-04-20 00:23:00,688,"right on, thats about what i was thinking, but i wasnt sure how well it'd work thanks guys"
332618,tonyb,2009-04-20 19:16:00,1637,"Suction cups will drive you crazy when they pop off and your transducer gets wrapped up in the prop  Here is another option, which is great for faster tinnies as it is very solid.  http://www.titelok.com/product_info.php?cP...products_id=129  Tony"
332642,Dara,2009-04-20 20:14:00,3052,"I use the same setup as drifter A piece of 1x2 or 1x3 and a C clamp. Adjust so the transducer is below the boat and the board flush, otherwise the board sticking down makes some awfull splashback at high speeds"
332661,jediangler,2009-04-20 20:41:00,1923,I have mine attached to my trolling motor which always goes along when I rent a boat.  I mount the display on a frisbee so I can move it anywhere in the rental boat.

332690,GBW,2009-04-20 21:23:00,8460,Same here.  my display is mounted on a milk crate (wood top with a hinge) and the battery is in the crate.  I even have the cable that plugs into the Hondaâ€™s alternator to keep the charge up.
332844,camillj,2009-04-21 01:33:00,1988,Here is the one I use after tossing my 'hockey stick' ... it works great and is really easy to adjust and remove .. and has never once slipped ... although I often take if off at high speed to avoid the rooster tail that sprays all over the back of the boat  http://images.cabelas.com/is/image/cabelas...ain-Large$
333195,Dara,2009-04-21 23:04:00,3052, I have a little 12v recharchable dry cell. It lasts over a week of daily fishing powering my depth finder.
333216,FSNmachine,2009-04-21 23:47:00,22,I use this tie-lok and it works great along with a 12 volt sealed cell from Cabelas that will last for days without a charge.  http://www.titelok.com/product_info.php?cP...products_id=123
333221,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-21 23:56:00,10439,"  I also have one of those, but as I said they tend to swing back under speed. I have found the board and C clamp works better and is less expensive. That said I will be using my Tite Lok unit on my inflatable pontoon this year as it will work fine with my 30# trolling motor."

333254,irishfield,2009-04-22 00:45:00,26272,"I don't know... it's at the lake ! Most transoms on the small stuff are 15"". Weld the tabs to fit the transducer onto a 3 foot length of  1/8"" x 1"" flat stock.... leave it that way 'till you get there and bend it to suit the boat."
333400,ColdH20guy,2009-04-22 12:06:00,312,just reading the Eagle manual..didnt realize you also need a 12v battery to hook it up....I guess I thought the AA batteries would do it.....so how do you keep the 12v dry? and charged? seems like a bit of a pain to have one of these in the boat as well..does it have to be a 'marine' battery? thanks guys
