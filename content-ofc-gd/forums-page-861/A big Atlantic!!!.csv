332103,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-19 23:18:00,0,"  did you miss the part where is said:   ""I'M NOT A BIO"" or do you just not like me because of the cormorant thread?"
332128,hotrod,2009-04-20 00:07:00,103,"It's nothing personal or anything to do with liking you or not liking you. I don't even know you.  I find your comments to show that your attitude is consistent with the ""bios"" Darryl describes, whether you are one or not."
332147,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-20 00:24:00,0,"i respect the fact that bios make informed decisions yes. and i respect the fact that they do whats best for the ecosystem, not what's best for obnoxious fisherman show hosts who feel our entire watershed is just one big personal fishpond."
332150,kickingfrog,2009-04-20 00:26:00,8333,"A nice fish by bucktail turns to this???     Where have you met these ""bios""?  What attitude is it that you are referring to? Do these ""bios"" offer facts and or opinions you disagree with? Or don't understand? Or can't understand? Or won't understand?  Do these ""bios"" that you have experienced this ""attitude"" from refuse to back-up their positions with research and proof?"
332156,irishfield,2009-04-20 00:30:00,26272, Based on the regs in Zone 11 and the treatment of the Temagami Stewardship...... YES !  Now can we get back to Bucktails fishing trip....
332165,kickingfrog,2009-04-20 00:36:00,8333,Politics unfortunately have a lot to do with regs.
332178,PERCHER,2009-04-20 00:47:00,787,Ya Wayne it was Bucktails trip and thread because I even seen him launch his boat.

332234,CLofchik,2009-04-20 01:41:00,854," Nice brown! See sig.       <runs hides>  You should baby that one, pull out all the stops.  White linen table cloth, bottle of wine older than your kids........that's like a $1200 fish, most expensive dinner you'll have this year!   So out of touch here he is filming a segment for his show on the new Port Dalhousie pen project last week..........y'know the one he's been harping on about for years up by his firepit in Owen Sound.  And not one bio in sight..........  "
332243,cisco,2009-04-20 01:45:00,597,"Very nice to see! Great fish for sure. I'd really like your opinion on how the fish fought relative to other similar-sized of other species. Oh, did it jump lots like some say they do? Again, congrats on a truly remarkable fish."

331812,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-04-19 11:56:00,1362,Great looking Atlantic Bucktail!!...congrats   ......That's a mighty fine bass ya got there too Glen!!
331834,Fudd,2009-04-19 13:15:00,94,"Congrats on the nice atlantic matey... top top fish.   I am in no way saying i agree with everything Darryl does or says but you need a reality check mate. I know of at least 10 trout stocking projects that would not exist if it was not for him. Back in the 80's when all the ""Einstein"" biologists were messing up our stocking programs and screwing with our fish stocks, it was Darryl that stood his ground and started half a dozen Rod n Gun club stocking programs of sustainable fish. Not splake... not tiger trout... not skamania..not super salmon... i am talking sustainable fish that actually breed.  Have a read... he says what a lot of us think. http://www.temagamistewardship.ca/news/SunTimesReport.html"
331847,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-19 13:44:00,0,"I don't need a reality check and am CERTAINLY not out of touch with our fisheries.  If you think someone with no science background knows better than people with masters and phd's obviously it is not I that is out of touch.  There are countless other TV personalities who are much better ambassadors for our sport and while he may have accomplished some things in the 80's, in the present I feel he does more harm than good.  A man who uses his television show as a platform for partisan politicians or to slag other provincial parties holds none of my respect.  Fishing, hunting, and the management of our natural resources is not political fodder for any political party.  While politicians come and go, there is always a dedicated group of people behind the scenes managing the fishery.   It sounds as though some of you hold the same cynical perspective on ""einstein"" public servants but I take my work very seriously.   So when some windbag constantly insults the work people are trying to do in fisheries how am I supposed to hold him in the same regard as other hosts who spend their time talking about conservation and ethics."
331851,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-19 13:55:00,0," Thanks for illustrating my point with an article where he refers to ""tree huggers"" and ""Indians"".  Very politically correct and professional. And gee, we all hate splake right?  What a waste of time!"
331852,lew,2009-04-19 13:57:00,12766,"WTG Darren, beautiful fish !!  Too bad a few folks saw fit to hi-jack your story though and turn it into something about Cronzey."
331854,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-19 14:01:00,0,apologies.  it is a beautiful fish.  but this is a public forum sooooooooo...
331855,Roy,2009-04-19 14:04:00,13728,"That really IS a spectacular fish. Congrats to you.  I agree with you Lew but I don't feel so bad  because no one has even spelled the man's name correctly on this thread so, they might not be talking about Darryl.  Again, congrats on the beauty fish!"
331860,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-19 14:17:00,2050," lol good call on the spelling thing Roy!  And agreed, try to keep this one on topic boys - beauty fish brother. Really nice looking specimen.  I'd love to hook into one of those babies someday.  Thanks for posting.  Cheers UF"

331925,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-19 16:46:00,0,i guess the 97% of fisherman who think he's a mouthbreather don't know how to spell his name. i guess he's just not that memorable eh guys?  
331951,misfish,2009-04-19 18:10:00,29133,"  It wasnt about Cronzey Lew,it was about how he feels the Atlantics are a waste,but this thread just showed that anglers are excited about catching an Atlantic and would like to see more.JMO  ""Hopefully this is the start of what will become a great comeback species for the Lake O fishery."""
331953,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-19 18:16:00,3761,"Nice job Bucktail, great fish for our team!"

331988,camillj,2009-04-19 20:05:00,1988,"Nice fish ... looks more like a musky to me ...and ... 27"" EH ... was that fork length or tip to tip ?  Im with Darryl though ... there does seem to be alot of attitude ... especially when it comes from people who spend more time weighing and measuring and working on justifying their budgets than on enhancing the fishing experience for fishermen. Sooner or later we need to face up to the fact that our fishery in southern Ontario is NOT sustainable period (unless we outlaw fishing) ... so it needs the ongoing support of the stocking programs especially Put & Take or Put & delayed take for the sport to remain vibrant ... I for one am not interested in Atlantics unless I am allowed to keep em and eat em .. they taste GREAT especially smoked ... but then so do Cohos and they were in great abundance once upon a time !  Woe the day we ever get to the stage they are out east where you can only catch one fish and then you have to pack up and go home .. none of this catch and release as many as you want out there ..."

331662,bucktail,2009-04-19 00:40:00,1857,"Went down to Bronte today after being skunked AGAIN catfishing on the Grand yesterday. Met Percher coming off the ramp, no good new. He tried from 10 to 300 feet of water with no love.  Decided to hit my favorite early season Brown spots along the shore. Runing a 3 rod spread of 2 #9 Blue and silver Raplalas and a Luhr Jensone Minnow in 7-12 feet of water.  Trolled about 5 miles with only one small hit when the wind stopped blowing from the west at .60k. It was during this lull that the flatline 150 feet staright out the back decided to start screaming> Big fish and lots of weight, took about 5 minutes to get a look at her. One minute I think its a brown the next I think it is a chinook.  Jonny finally scoops her in the net and onboard comes a big bold and beautiful 27 inch brown! Hooks are in the gill unfortunatly so I curse having to keep such a beautiful chrome silver fish.  Its at this time that something doesnt look right.... hmmmm...... head is very slender...... no dots on the adipose or tail. Get home and count the teeth on the tongue and count the rays on the anal fin..... 9 rays... dorsal fin clip amdtoungue matches up.  Seems this is a big Atlantic, probably one of the original stockers.  Here are some pictures.... barring a DNA test she is an Atlantic!  Hard way for team 4 to get 27 inches for a salmon.....dont I get bonus inches!!!   Pics a in a few minutes         "
331664,irishfield,2009-04-19 00:44:00,26272,Good thing it was 27 inches long eh...
331667,bucktail,2009-04-19 00:53:00,1857,"Yea no kidding , I was trying to remember the minimum size on it. Thank god I got it right. Cant catch a friggin catfish but I can catch a big atlantic......go figure. Took the laptop right out to the fish and did the ID on it. Too bad we had to keep her....bummmer"
331669,kemper,2009-04-19 00:53:00,2232,I hope no one tries to dispute THIS one.  Full of eggs?  nice fish
331671,misfish,2009-04-19 00:58:00,29133,Send that pic to Cronzy.  Nice clean looking fish.

331679,siwash,2009-04-19 01:04:00,683,We're seeing more and more Atlantics coming out of Lake O. I've seen a few this spring already on the salmon board... Looks like the stockig program is starting to work! That's a healthy looking fish...  We'll be lucky if these things take... fantastic fighters...
331681,misfish,2009-04-19 01:05:00,29133,"Nothing to do with eating it. It,s about his hatred of the Atlantic stocking."
331682,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-19 01:07:00,0,Chronzey's favourite thing to do in the world is criticize the MNR.  Next to eating of course. He's completely out of touch with his sport.  Like the Don Cherry of fishing.
331684,irishfield,2009-04-19 01:10:00,26272,Now lets not go ruining bucktails post with Choronzey banter... especially from someone that's working the fishery. Do some history...Darryl's done more for the fishery in Ontario than anyone on this board... that's a fact. Nothing wrong with him getting a tad older and a little crusty. lol
