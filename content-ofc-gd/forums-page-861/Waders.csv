332644,steelheader42,2009-04-20 20:18:00,44,I have a pair of Bear breathables now. Im looking at getting a new pair of waders l seen some streamside breathables...l was just wondering if anyone ever had a pair and are they very durable? and is 240 a good price?
332739,pikeie,2009-04-20 22:41:00,380,"i have a pair of bear ones too... i must have got a bad pair because ive only had these things for 2 years, and the leak like crazy!  i get just about as wet when im not wearing them lmao. a good friend of mine has a pair of the streamside waders and he finds them great. but i think my next purchase is going to be a pair of simms...."
332744,rbaquial,2009-04-20 22:54:00,968,Check out LLBEAN.COM - they apparently have the BEST GUARANTEE out there; LIFETIME - No questions asked!  I'm actually going to order a pair tonite!
332754,BillM,2009-04-20 23:08:00,17367,Simms Riverteks at BPS $199.  Won't find a better wader for the price.  I used them extensively this year for steelies and absolutely loved them.
332759,irishfield,2009-04-20 23:19:00,26272,Just don't buy the rubber Redheads... my hip boots where good for the first summer... and even though they are properly hung off season.. they are cracked and I know I'm gettin wet when I use them so go sockless in them ! Looking at trying the Stearns Madd Dog line that are nylon this round..
332794,rbaquial,2009-04-21 00:32:00,968,  I can't seem to find it on the BPS website!   :dunno:
332800,BillM,2009-04-21 00:41:00,17367," You probably won't, it's last years stock.  There is a whole pile of them in the flyshop at Vaughn Mills."
332802,rbaquial,2009-04-21 00:42:00,968,oh yeah?! I was there today....they were/are going for $199??  maybe I can go tomorrow...
332806,BillM,2009-04-21 00:45:00,17367,Everytime I've been there after I purchased mine they were still $199.  They have boxes of them below the chest packs and all along that wall.  Dunno how much of a selection they have now though.
332821,crankbait,2009-04-21 01:02:00,82,Was at BPS yesterday didn't stop in the flyshop. Will check out the deal as well.
333027,oates,2009-04-21 14:33:00,151,"I bought a pair of PVC for $60, hot, stickey, burn your skin (rub against), slide off your shoulders, boots unstable.  Just FYI if you go the poor man route."
333031,FLEX ROD,2009-04-21 14:45:00,394,"FYI,  I called the BPS Fly shop and spoke to Gord, he informed me that all he has left are small's.  To bad as I thought that I would pick up are pair myself.   Just in case you are driving any distance want to save a wasted trip.  FLEX"
333045,bare foot wader,2009-04-21 15:18:00,1354,"I don't think it matters what brand you buy or how much you spend....there are only 2 types of waders IMO: waders that leak....and waders that will eventually leak....that UV repair glue is a great product...keeps you going streamside, only takes a few mins to fix a pinhole  I am currently using wright & mcgill....moderately priced, came to about 250, bit cheaper maybe, and the built in back belt is amazing....the stocking foot is excessively generously cut....which makes my boots too small now...but other than that solid waders....extra layering on the knees and a good fit all over.....  got mine at Steve's in Lambeth"
333125,steelheader42,2009-04-21 19:00:00,44, Thanks for the info....You just saved me a trip.
333127,batoathome,2009-04-21 19:14:00,47,I own a pair of streamside breathables and so far 2 seasons of hard fishing no wear yet.   Angling outfitters in woodstock has them  can't beat his prices and warranty  here is there number  1519 539 5494.   They are in woodstock ontario.  WORTH the drive from Mississuaga.   They have a wide selection of other breathables there and I am only posting this because  i have been very happy with their service and product.  Highly recommended.
333129,ryansusanna,2009-04-21 19:21:00,27,2 words...  Dan Bailey
333210,rbaquial,2009-04-21 23:28:00,968, Yeah... Thank you!  Saved me a trip too... I ended up getting a pair from LLBEAN anyway Can't wait to get 'em!
