332403,turtle,2009-04-20 11:33:00,274,I have a approx 10 yr old Honda 15HP outboard that most of the prop paint has worn off and needs repainting.  I would think that first it needs to be sanded and de-greased and then painted or primed/painted.  Is there any specific marine paint for this or can I just use something like Tremclad?  Any suggestions? Thanks.

Prep it up with a light sand & degrease it 2 coats of tremclad  you should be good to go did the same with my prop 40 hp merc still looks as good as the day I painted it . if you want some added protection try 2 or 3 coats of a clear  sealer or epoxy . hope this helps . .
