332881,Cudz,2009-04-21 02:59:00,2652,"Lots of new high end lures at CTC Barrie South store. Just a few examples: Gary Yamamoto 5"" Senkos Fin-tech jigs (both knuckle ball jigs and football jigs) Trigger X Pheremone baits (quite a good selection of grubs creature baits, stick worms and sprays) Lunker something tube jigs that look like they are really good quality. There was a couple of newer rapalas as well.  The big glider shad looked nice. Lots of new gulp zoom money minnow swimbaits Lindy's new jig system (interchangeable heads and hooks. complete lineup)  Those Trigger X products look the business.  Might splurge for some.  They are not cheap though. i bought some knuckle ball jig heads.  They were fairly resonable."
332886,GBW,2009-04-21 03:02:00,8460,Whitby North has done the same with the new gear.  Just an FYI for those out in that area like me...

332977,Garnet,2009-04-21 12:57:00,2056,"Last year north Whitby CT was a joke will stop by and check. The south Whitby CT was always very good.  For 15 years the north Oshawa CT was heavy weight champ.  Bowmanville just sucks.   Now recently the very very best CT is the one in south Kingston I was stunned at the selection.   Talk about over priced plastic I was in Gagnons yesterday and 5 Mr Twister crappy baits were $10.99 beside a 15 bag Yammanmoto crappy baits $4.99 beside Phantom 20 count for $3.99, them twisters must be good. I bought 3 phantoms 2 yammy and went fishn and ate a hotdog at beefsteak.  Garnet"

333256,dada2727,2009-04-22 00:46:00,108,"I too was also surprised when I walked into the CT in Lindsay.  Picked up some shakey head jigs and finese worms, flippin jigs, hooks and some bullet sinkers.  They were still adding stuff when I was there monday, so should be stocked right up this weekend.  They even have a respectable Musky selection now, not just a couple M/G's and some Kickin minnows anymore!"
