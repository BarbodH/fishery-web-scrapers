331833,bigugli,2009-04-19 13:12:00,6138,"Got my sucker baits and heavier rods ready and ran out to the Welland R.  Never saw any channel cats. Got a number of bullheads scarfing the cut bait     A little while later was joined by Smokin Joe and his son ""Curious George""  At that point the little stuff started showing up.  Some OOS fish decided they liked cut sucker as well  Little Joey kept trying to go swimming in the river, but no white stripes, even if the rest of the fish were really small. "
331838,smokin joe,2009-04-19 13:31:00,226,"It was a great day to get out even though the big ones didn't want to come and play, the little ones where fun on the ultra lite   ""Curious George"" sure was trying to go for a swim   One of these days he'll settle down and do some real fishing and not the you hook it and I get to reel it in     I hope   Nothing beats getting out there with some great friends for a days fishing   And thanks for the custom streamers Bruce they look awesome"
331896,Greencoachdog,2009-04-19 15:30:00,8163,Those Bullheads fry up real nice if that water is clean!
332351,bigugli,2009-04-20 03:34:00,6138,"Went out again, today, in the hope of connecting with perch or crappie. Kept hitting OOS bass and small rockies. Had the apple of my eye out with us this time. At least we all caught some fish.   "
332359,Greencoachdog,2009-04-20 03:47:00,8163,You're fishing too small and too shallow if that's all you were catching!... increase your bait size and depth!!!
332740,rockfish,2009-04-20 22:43:00,91,"Good to see u getting the kids out Bruce, even tho it still has been on the cool side but at least it's not snowing."
332758,bigugli,2009-04-20 23:19:00,6138, I have to plan out my fishing breaks a little more carefully these days. Someone has got to be with Anna all the time. We've had far too many scares the past month.
332767,evster,2009-04-20 23:39:00,367,If you were fishing where I think you were I might have cruised past you.  Do you remember seeing a camo 14 foot tinny with a bowmount on it go cruising by?  We were scouting out spots along the river coming from Wellandport down.
332793,bigugli,2009-04-21 00:31:00,6138," You must have been one of 2 camo'd tinnies.  Must have been the V hull, the Jon boat 's motor tanked."
332819,evster,2009-04-21 01:00:00,367," Yep, we were the V hull one.  We went past when that jon boat was trying to get going, then turned around and went back past a few minutes later.  Thats a pretty long boat ride and we were lucky we made it all the way back.  We forgot to check the fuel level before going on the adventure and ran the tank dry.  Must have been running on fumes when we put it on the trailer."
333792,Leecher,2009-04-23 01:24:00,7832,Great report and pics Bruce  I remember when dad and I used to go out for bull heads..... they're a ton fun to catch when the bite is on. Hope that your little one is feeling better. Thanks for sharing Jacques
