332916,rbaquial,2009-04-21 06:17:00,968,"Hey,  I checked the REG's... appears only YELLOW PERCH, CRAPPIE, SUNFISH, TROUT, SALMON, WHITEFISH and CATFISH are open. I've never caught a WHITEFISH before, so I'm interested in what tackle I'll need to hook into one. I'm pretty sure there aren't any TROUT/SALMON in Rice Lake - then again, I don't know... I've only had a handful of chances to fish there.  Any suggestions on what tackle I should bring when I head to Rice Lake on Friday Evening? I'm already bringing tackle necessary to catch PERCH, SUNFISH and CRAPPIE... But, what would I need to catch WHITEFISH?  What about live bait? or even the Gulp!Alive stuff? Anything anyone can suggest for that?  Thanks! RoB"
332917,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-21 06:38:00,270,I'm heading up Saturday ummm bring spinners grubs stuff like that! IDK
332919,MillerPhoto,2009-04-21 06:43:00,147,"Well I wasn't in Rice Lake.. but lower on the Trent Severn last monday for Crappie.. they were hittin hard anything pink and white.. I had a white teardrop tiped with a old piece of pink power bait.. (looked like a 1/2 meal worm)  after about 15 crappie i lost the pink bait, and was just using the white teardrop and they were still hittin hard!"
332920,JayZ,2009-04-21 06:45:00,18,i've never seen or heard of a whitefish in rice lake so they might be tough to catch.
332929,Woodsman,2009-04-21 09:52:00,1286,As Jay said. Don't worry about whitefish in Rice Lake. Now if your looking for bigger fish that fight good don't rule out carp.  Rick
332933,mbac31,2009-04-21 10:17:00,904,"Like they said, there are no whitefish in rice lake.  Tons of big crappie though. Look for them on flats and shallow bays in about 4-8 fow. Tubes and tiny crankbaits are best.  personally I use crankbaits for them. Tends to weed out the bigger ones. Good Luck!"
332944,Blake,2009-04-21 11:26:00,418,No Whitefish in Rice Lake.  The crappie will keep ya busy if you can find them.
332986,JeffBornFishin,2009-04-21 13:16:00,260,Have fun launching a boat...there are no docks in.  The water is very high right now...was working down there yesterday.
333044,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-21 15:15:00,270,   any lakes near by with docks!
333046,Stoty,2009-04-21 15:18:00,2910,If you have two people or a long rope...launching without a dock isn't a big deal.
333048,mbac31,2009-04-21 15:23:00,904,Guaranteed there will be docks in there by Saturday. Same thing every year.
333084,Nippissinger,2009-04-21 16:47:00,53,"Yes smalliefisher. I agree. with the season opener this weekend and the anticipated warmth and multitude of fishers, I am sure they will have the docks in and if they dont, then like Stoty mentions, a long rope will launch a boat in any water... At 20+ degrees I won't be afraid to get my feet wet for a shot at filling the well with tasty slabs....  This is GONNA BE GREEEEEAT!!!!!!  Nipper..."
333085,diggyj,2009-04-21 16:51:00,548,"Twin Cedars on Rice Lake has permanent, concrete docks, so launching with any height of water level is possible. So does the launch at Hiawatha. Dirk...

333144,Sinker,2009-04-21 20:58:00,8692,"Those concrete docks could very well be under water. I don't know for sure, I just know the water is really high right now. Same as every year.  Bring tubes and floats. That's all you'll need. Pink and white is good, red/black is also good.  Look for the crowds of boats......you'll see them  Sinker"
333184,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-21 22:46:00,270,oooh for sure!
333241,rbaquial,2009-04-22 00:36:00,968," hey, do you have the phone#'s to these places by chance? Also, isnt there a shop out in Bewdley? I remember seeing one....not sure.."
