333203,Rustic-Fisher,2009-04-21 23:22:00,826,"Just wondering what others are doing?? We're fishing brookies up north and than steelies once the crowds thin out during the week.  Good luck, RF"
333204,BassAsin,2009-04-21 23:25:00,806,"where exactly is ""north"" for the brookies?"
333205,Rustic-Fisher,2009-04-21 23:26:00,826,Sorry ...Algonquin area.  Rf
333206,solopaddler,2009-04-21 23:27:00,8605,"Brook trout definitely, it's been a long wait."

333329,BillM,2009-04-22 02:48:00,17367,"Steve, I am hoping to make it out that way and try my luck Sat morning.  Only have been a few times around the Markdale area.  All my fish will be released also, hopefully I luck out and hit a decent stream!"
333338,timmeh,2009-04-22 03:14:00,609,"It's definitely been a while since my last brookie, but I couldn't get out for steelhead as much as I hoped, and since they're migrating back to the lakes, I may have to give them a go. Or maybe I'll stay more local and tie into a few browns... Or try to anyway. But my fishing will be cut short to watch the NFL draft in the afternoon.  I also release all brookies I catch, and any river caught trout for that matter, and it's nice to hear others also take the conservation minded approach with these fish.  Have a good weekend fellas"
333343,Cookslav,2009-04-22 03:32:00,1457,"Solitude and Specks fer sure, and Maybe a Laker or two"
333377,Spiel,2009-04-22 09:07:00,9065,It'll be brookies and browns in the morning for me then perhaps off to the Musky Odyssey in the afternoon.
333382,solopaddler,2009-04-22 09:35:00,8605, Only cause you're allergic otherwise we'd be calling you Cronzy-lite.  Hope your freeze dried foods taste yummy next week.
333421,cambo,2009-04-22 13:06:00,62,"Hey Steve I'll be out and about Sat morning to maybe I'll see you around, pretty sure we haunt the same areas. Cam"
333439,Zubris21,2009-04-22 14:17:00,563,"Opener?  I've been fishing Brookies all winter, oh wait we don't have a closed season on them, or on any game fish really."
333454,Dara,2009-04-22 14:52:00,3052,  Thats what I was thinking...since when are they closed
333462,fish_finder,2009-04-22 15:07:00,370,"Well, after spending the last 5 or 6 months steelheading, I'll definitely be out for some brookie action from saturday till monday......then I'll probably hit some steelhead tribs for a couple of days!"
333473,CLofchik,2009-04-22 15:27:00,854,"Friend of the family owns two miles of prime water on a GBay trib that also holds a good resident population of brookies, does that count as a two'fer?.........I know, life is rough.   I'm not a big fan of eating freshwater fish, I love fresh tuna and will even eat a salad if it has grilled mackerel on it........but I can't resist keeping a few freshwater shrimp fed GBay trout.  AND it's fiddlehead season.......mmmmmm planked trout with fiddlehead risotto, I mean c'mon who can't resist that."
333500,Dara,2009-04-22 16:30:00,3052,"  Yep Yep Yep..fiddleheads, morels and walleye, with some fried taters..all over a fire...can't wait,"

333549,Rustic-Fisher,2009-04-22 18:24:00,826,I can't wait for this video LOL  :lol:
333639,ehg,2009-04-22 20:54:00,2666,I'll be trying the headwaters for brookies to beat the crowds. Gonna have an eye open for morels in the nearby woods.
