333729,ColdH20guy,2009-04-22 23:10:00,312,thx Roy...how much are they these days?  just ran over..lol  looks like it is a 2002 20hp merc..heavy too! (112lbs) ouch.....  I know she had it winterized and the label says do not operate it until de-winterized..curious what that involves? is the gas/oil ratio 100:1 for these?  thx for the info
