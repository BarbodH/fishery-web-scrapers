333173,l2p,2009-04-21 22:15:00,346,"went out with a buddy today before the rain and ended up catching my largest crappie to date. didnt get a chance to properly measure but was easily pushing 2 lbs for sure and was atleast 8"" long. after a couple pics back in she went.      kept a couple smaller ones for the grandparents.(these were the average size of the crappie being caught)    Goodluck to everyone this weekend!"
333176,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-21 22:28:00,3761,"Pretty good size Crappie, but I'm sure you will be able to beat that PB no problem!  Thanks for sharing"
333177,danbouck,2009-04-21 22:29:00,4380,"I've fished there too, then I quit drinking!"
333180,Stoty,2009-04-21 22:37:00,2910,"Nice slab for sure...but, I highly doubt it was anywhere near 2 lbs. An 8"" fish that weighs 2 lbs?"
333182,l2p,2009-04-21 22:46:00,346,"hahah like i said this was by far my largest crappie, the guy next to me said it looked about that so i based my opinion on it. it did have quite the gut and im sure ya'll know pics dont do fish justice. but then again i could be completly off. this is actually my first season fully targetting panfish at this time of year and i must say it is quite fun and could become a part of the whole opener ritual."
333188,kickingfrog,2009-04-21 22:55:00,8333,Nice fish. Thanks for the photos.
333196,Cudz,2009-04-21 23:04:00,2652,"nice fish.  It is begger than 8"" but I think not quite 2 lbs."
333198,BillM,2009-04-21 23:06:00,17367,Crappies are now a hot commodity?  lol
333217,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-21 23:49:00,2050,"I'd say that's bigger than 8"" to dude!  I could be way off but it looks just as big as the ones I got the other day which were around the 11 inch mark.  good job dude - hard to beat table fare like that.  cheers, UF"
333219,kickingfrog,2009-04-21 23:53:00,8333," Ya, if that is 8 inches I'm... never mind."
333224,l2p,2009-04-22 00:04:00,346,"haha i would also say its a little longer than 8"", in the first pic i have the fish directly adjacent to my chest, i wear a medium tee comfortably. im not gona go measure my shirts but i think its safe to say its a littler longer than 8 inches lol"
