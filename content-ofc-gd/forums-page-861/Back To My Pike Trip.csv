332912,Ramble,2009-04-21 04:00:00,713,"I can see some holes in their.  Spinners. DEFINATLY need some bluefox inline spinners. #5's or 6's. 4's can work too if you cant find the bigger ones. I hate to say it, but Wal-mart usually carries #5's. Orange/Gold, Silver, and the Firetiger are the best for pike. Don't worry about the blue/silver one WILL see. (The things are everywhere) Switch out the treble and add a 4 inch twister tail. Orange on the Coloured spinners and white or Pink on teh silver.  Also. White spinner Bait with White blades. I see you have 1 white spinner bait, but i find them to be consistant pike caters. Also stick a twistertail on teh spinner baits as well. Use a contrasting colour.  There was a comment earlier about you not having many baits to target the bottom. Find some Storm Swim Baits. 5 inches long or a bit bigger. The pink or white are both as good as the fire tiger or orange. They work better then they look like they are going too.  If you find the fish REALLY slow on any of your days....usually due to weather try jigging a Twin White twister tail in white. Match the jig head to water depth.  REMEMBER when pike fishing in teh spring water temperature is EVERYTHING. They will be seeking it out. But they are still going to want access to deeper water. Combine those 2 things and you will be in buisness.  -Dave"
332913,scuro2,2009-04-21 04:13:00,904,"When pike are in the mood, you don't need much. I like something that can also make noise on the surface and it doesn't have to be a buzzbait. It can be a spoon, spinner, or plastic. With pike one lure for weeds is good. You don't want to be snagged every cast in the slop or close to shore. When you can't catch, it's more a case of you finding them...and just going slower, smaller, and deeper.  So in a nutshell, it's not so much the right lure, but more the right location, the right time, and the right action. Lures do their job....that's why I own so many of them."
332940,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-21 11:06:00,3761," I got a pack of these Storm swimbaits awhile back...there orange and fairly heavy, guess i should pack them also eh"

333132,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-21 19:51:00,3761,"Lol, thank you Highdrifter    If i get the materials i will be sure to try out your sweet looking leader you made up ok. But where am i going to be able to get a foot of some heavy fluoro(maybe Gagnon's...anybody think i can get some there?). I'm surprised that those pike don't cut through that line but if i can i'll be sure to give it a try ok.  Thank you Highdrifter and the rest of the OFC guys and gals that put up with my day to day questions"
333159,bare foot wader,2009-04-21 21:33:00,1354,"get some bucktails, williams wablers and go BIG - you'd be surprised the results you get with the big boys, big thill slip floats for dead drifting suckers/chubs  and for dragging on bottom get some large jigheads with solid, wide gap hooks and get some saltwater grubs - 6 to 8""....big bass jigs and some plastic lizards for trailers  make sure you have solid wire snippers and replacement trebles too"
333174,highdrifter,2009-04-21 22:20:00,2534," Don't mention it!  Some folks here are more than happy to oblige..  I was just in a good mood!!  LOL  Gagnon's should have the stuff, maybe not Seagar, but something just as good no doubt.  Now git out there and fish boyee!"
333207,Reelpro,2009-04-21 23:27:00,73,"Check out the Rapala Saltwater Husky Jerk. Silver/Black and Gold/Black.  The solid bait not the jointed ones. For spring Pike retreive these with a stop and go action, Long pulls - point rod at bait and pull to your side, so 6 or 7 feet of line is pulled. Experiment with speed/candence.  I have won a 2007 Pike tournament using these baits, lots of Pike of all sizes, including a 42"" and a 46"".  Very tough durable lure. Should work well in GB, there are lots of baitfish with a similar profile the Pike there eat.  GL MIKE"
333225,wmshaw,2009-04-22 00:05:00,42,I would add  large sized Johnson Silver and Gold minnow baits.  Works great in very weedy conditions.

332676,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-20 21:04:00,3761,"Ok so i have been going through my tackle and picking out some lures that i'm going to be bringing to GBay in some Plano cases. I got some spoons and leaders recently. I want to make up a ""Quick Strike"" rig for using large minnows also to go with my little pike tackle box aswell as get some of the suggested spoons and spinners from my other thread. Are there any other baits that i should get instead of others...As of now im looking at 2 more spoons and 2 spinners. Any spoons/spinners that should be first on my list at Canadian Tire?  Thanks, also:  What lb test should i use on this ""Quick Strike Rig"" i'm going to be making?  Best Regards, Mike  PS-I will not forget my team sign!"
332680,setomonkey,2009-04-20 21:06:00,872,"Can't go wrong with some crankbaits, like a couple of Husky jerks and x-raps (natural & bright).  I mostly fish with crankbaits or spoons for pike. Spinnerbaits are great too if you have room, but they often get wrecked in a day of catching aggressive pike.  (Some of my crankbaits are in pretty bad shape too!)  Mike"
332693,Garry2Rs,2009-04-20 21:25:00,1425,"What you have there looks good.  All of those baits will catch Pike, and you already have more than what you will use. Don't waste your money buying on whim or speculation. Wait until you need to replace something, or until you see a bait, and know exactly where, why and how you will use it. We all have lures that never get in the water.  We bought them to fill up space, instead of to fill a need."
332695,ctdd2006,2009-04-20 21:28:00,531,I can't see you needing anything more!  Great selection.
332696,GBW,2009-04-20 21:28:00,8460,And that is why I have a LARGE soft tackle bag and a med. bag overflowing with tackleâ€¦
332717,bassjnkie,2009-04-20 21:57:00,1101,"That is a great selection. Someone above said it, buy as you need it. But what you have there will defiantly get you into pike. Word of advice, most of the time when a pike hits the spinner bait, the bait really bends out of shape."
332718,gone_fishin,2009-04-20 21:58:00,481,"pike like bright colours (most of the time)... red, yellow, orange... but, if that doesn't work, don't forget to try natural colours (match the hatch)."
332726,Governator,2009-04-20 22:11:00,879,"Looks very good.  I personally prefer having several bucktails to throw, Mepps #5."

332742,bigbuck,2009-04-20 22:54:00,2449,"For making a quick strike rig, you need 30lb test steel wire, and a couple of nice sized treble hooks, beads and the like are optional. You  could also use 50lb or higher flurocarbon leader material. For early spring pike, nothing beats a nice sucker on a quick strike rig, depending on the weather, if it's been cold, they don't bite all that hard."
332746,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-20 22:56:00,3761,I knew i should of changed this blanket today lol....bla bla bla    were getting better you just wait bud.
332750,rockfish,2009-04-20 23:02:00,91,"Selection looks pretty good, especially with the suspending baits like the Huskies and the X-raps that u can stop and go retrieve when the cold fronts hit and the pike don't feel like chasing lures.  I've always had luck on Little Cleo spoons, 3/4 oz or 2/5 oz in the hammered style in green or chartruese. They can also be put to good use for trout and salmon.  You could also add a couple inline spinners and I've had the best luck on Vibrax spinners in the #4 and #5 with bright coloured centers. They also work well for a variety of species. One last thing is u might want to get some longer needle nosed pliers in the 10"" range, with some baits the pike will take a lure in deeper and will save a few cuts and scrapes from those razor sharp teeth.   "
332773,highdrifter,2009-04-20 23:51:00,2534,"All good tid bits here.  You're pretty much set!  If you'll be using mono for your quick strike rigs, i'd go with 80lbs.  Anything heavier is just too thick.  Seagar is a good name.   You could also use the mono for leader material.  If you happen to fish clearer water, you'll have an edge.  Especially if it's fluro.  It's also a little more boyant, provided there's not too much hardware, so your lure will sit better in the water.  It's all about confidence really.  If your bait performs well, you'll concentrate more on your retrieve, and you'll know exactly how your bait looks to the fish..  It sure gives me a big booster.  I tie my own fluro leaders.  Instead of sleaves (crimps) to hold the loops together, I'll tie a nail knot with 50lb braid..  The less hardware on the leader, the more natural your HJ 13 firetiger is gonna look.  check it.  It's beauty is in it's simplicity!!    One descent swivel..    And a good snap..    The nail knot is a little difficult to master, but they've always held fast for me.  I take plyers to the tag ends and really pull.  The coils get so tight they actually dig in to the mono a bit.  good piking dude!  cheers HD"
332805,rockfish,2009-04-21 00:45:00,91,"That's a pretty cool knot HD, will have to learn that one. I've been using 35 lb fluoro and it works fine with the snotters but don't trust it with bigger fish.  I was given a pretied flouro leader by a kind fisherman that likes to remain anonymous. Wasn't anything happening with the pike that day but he was attracting beavers.  His identity as well as the beaver's had to be hidden.  "
332822,crankbait,2009-04-21 01:04:00,82,"Looks like you got all the essentials, now get out there and catch one."
332823,highdrifter,2009-04-21 01:04:00,2534," A re-gift??!  He'd sure as heck better stay nameless!!  Another interesting tid bit.  You don't need a tool to make the knot.. or a slender tube..  I tie the coils over a loop, put the tag end through the loop and pull at the loop itself, bringing the tag through the coils, thus fastening the knot.  Good to know if you're out in the field and say you wanna connect a leader to a fly line.."
332831,BillM,2009-04-21 01:13:00,17367,"Go catch a crap load of big creek chubs, or get your hands on some frozen smelt.  Nothing beats dead bait in the spring for pike."
332836,Dara,2009-04-21 01:22:00,3052,"I would add a half decent sized williams wabler in gold/silver. I don't fish a lot of pike, but the guys that I know that do call that one the ""dinner bell"" for pike. I have fished with them, and it works. I wouldn't be without one for pike."
332840,rockfish,2009-04-21 01:25:00,91," Pretty sure that the leader that Mr anomynous gave me tied it himself and used metal crimps.  I looked up the ""nail knot"" and it looks like a fancy snell type knot and wondered what u use for a tube, so that answered my question.  Do u just use braided line to hold everything together ?"
332842,EC1,2009-04-21 01:32:00,930,"Lol Mike. You always ask if you need anything else. You have got WAYYY More than what I have myself, and I can almost assure you that not every single one of those baits are even going to see water in 2009.  Get out and get Fishing!"
332846,Garry2Rs,2009-04-21 01:35:00,1425,"Looking at your collection once again, something strikes me. You don't have any baits to fish at or near the bottom. Fished normally, the spinnerbaits and the spoons are essentially the same thing in different wrappers... Fast moving, shallow to mid-depth flash-attractor baits. The Jerks and Rap baits are shallow to mid-water slow moving baits...cast...give it a tug, wait, tug it again. They dive and glide, and dive again...never getting very deep. You might want to add some tubes and jigs, or even just jigs to use with your Gulp. In the Spring a large part of a Pike's diet consists of dead and dying Shad etc. that they pick off the bottom. If you don't have any jigs, you can let a spoon settle to the bottom, jerk it up and then let it flutter down again. This works for Bass too by the way. If the bottom is snaggy, jigs are cheaper to lose than spoons...GRIN."
332858,highdrifter,2009-04-21 01:55:00,2534," AHHH okay..  The beaver man I know woudn't dare!!  I've fiddled with mono and dacron, but braid does the trick.  It's all I use to secure my loops.  Less bulk, lower profile."
332859,mikeh,2009-04-21 01:56:00,824,"the only thing I would add would be some trailer hooks for the spinnerbaits,also don't use your most expensive spinnerbaits for pike,good luck out there."
332875,OhioFisherman,2009-04-21 02:36:00,6623,"Fish top to bottom until you locate them, then concentrate most of your time on the area of activity, try to establish a pattern and repeat until proven unsuccessful. You don`t have to fish a spinnerbaits fast you can slow roll them, cast it let it settle to the bottom and crank slowly, if you can`t be sure were it is stopp the retrieve and let it sink. A technique better(easier) with a heavier spinner bait 3/4 to 1 1/2 ounce but can be done with a lighter one in shallower water. A rubber core sinker with the rubber pulled out can be crimped to the hook shank to add weight with out changing the lure profile.  Jig and pig, jig and craw, tubes will work deeper for pike."
332895,Mike the Pike,2009-04-21 03:31:00,3421,You need the Pink Rapala X-rap.  You also need some Mepps no Pike fisherman should be without mepps.
