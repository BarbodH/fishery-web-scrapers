333679,moemoe,2009-04-22 22:12:00,352,"A question for the more mechanically incline then me, what size bearings would I need for my ezloader trailer? It's a 3500lb bunk trailer, with 14 inch tires, and the trailer is a year 2000. I am assuming it would be just a regular 1 1/8, but how could I find out before I took the wheel apart?"

333695,irishfield,2009-04-22 22:29:00,26272,Should be able to hit their website with a trailer serial number /model number and get the details. I know I did that for my Shorelander.
