333112,Governator,2009-04-21 18:07:00,879,"Here's a link to zone 17 regulation:  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR_E001336.pdf  There is an exception for Scugog River in Lindsay:  Scugog River (Lindsay) - Ops Twp.,from Trent-Severn Dam to Ops-Fenelon boundary.   Fish sanctuary - no fishing from 4th Sat. in Apr. - Fri. after 2nd Sat. in May.  I'm going to guess your out of luck till May 9th but someone might be able to clarify, I don't know the area."
333142,Jer,2009-04-21 20:52:00,1426,"  Nobody knows where the Ops-Fenelon border is anymore. It doesn't show up on any newer maps, it's all City of Kawartha Lakes."
333143,Sinker,2009-04-21 20:55:00,8692,"Your good to go where  your planning on going. You'd be way up stream of the dam. The sanctuary is downstream. Most people go by the old rail trussles there, but the actual boundary is an invisible line that runs across the bay. I've never seen it enforced. If your between the dam and the old rail bridge, your in the sanctuary IMO.  Good luck.   Sinker"
