407834,msp,2009-12-02 20:55:00,1336,"Hey guys, Did a lot of pike fishing this fall......as usual. Decided to give up steelheading this season to chase after fall bass and pike. Had a great season with tons of fish being taken on all types of baits. Mostly jerk baits. Here are some of the better fish this fall. No true giants, but some respectable toothy critters. When I compile and download all my fall bass photos I will post them for ya all !           "
407838,TerryC,2009-12-02 21:08:00,196,"Those are beautiful Pike, they would be considered GIANTS in my book.  Clarence"
407839,Roy,2009-12-02 21:08:00,13728,Really nice fish! You guys work some pretty choppy water there eh?

407937,Roy,2009-12-03 01:04:00,13728, Leave it alone jayson. You're already treading on thin ice.
408159,MJL,2009-12-03 18:31:00,2427,"Holy mother of Gawd...Those are BEAUTIES!!!  With monsters like those about, it kinda makes me wanna rethink the whole idea of skinny dipping"
408166,splashhopper,2009-12-03 19:09:00,2931,"if those fish are "" nothing too big""... i would love to see one that you consider BIG"

408434,Fishing 24/7,2009-12-04 15:59:00,709,hey msp nice pike .   that last one .  is that a flipping jig rigged with a swim bait?!?!?  and what type of line are you using fluoro?  sweet report dude.  the reason why im asking is that iv been catching pike while flipping and pitching for bass this year.  oversizing the lure could get me into some seriouse pike like yourself.
408440,tdotfisherman,2009-12-04 16:27:00,317,"Nice man, you made the right choice... The Pike have really been on this fall."
408883,msp,2009-12-06 01:55:00,1336,"24/7, yeah, I have been using it quite a bit this season. Its a 3/4 oz. bass flipping jig with a yum money minnow on the back.Pesistance finally paid off. I like to use 55 # flourocarbon leaders for pike. I tie it on directly to 50 or 30 # power pro with a back to back uni knot. It seems to work well although I have been bitten off. The key is to inspect the leader and re-tie often.  Thanks everybody for the kind words."
409077,johnnyb,2009-12-06 19:01:00,3413,"saw this report at work this week, but pics wouldn't show....finally getting to enjoy it now.  Nice work, man!"
409081,Fishing 24/7,2009-12-06 19:04:00,709,  PURE GENIUS RIGHT THERE!  thanks for the great tip man this is a must next year!
409433,ehg,2009-12-07 19:29:00,2666,A lot of big pike there!  Not bad for southern Ontario.
