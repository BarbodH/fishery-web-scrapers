409185,laszlo,2009-12-06 23:29:00,487,"Yesterday I checked the forecast and saw that it was going to be –6 feels like –12 this morning and thought, forget it.  The water I wanted to fish was still high and stained and I thought, no way.  Seems Highdrifters (Fidel) enthusiasm is infectious because today at 7am I somehow found myself beside a river. Not the one I was hoping to fish but a river nonetheless. Glad I did!  We both ended the day 3/4 and getting into some nice fish…             Thanks for Reading."
409200,StoneFly,2009-12-06 23:54:00,574,Good Job Laz....what is the red spot on the last fish behind the eye?  just some kindof marking?
409211,BillM,2009-12-07 00:20:00,17367,Fidel's lipstick probably rubbed off on the poor thing.  
409214,fishinguypat,2009-12-07 00:31:00,547,what's up with te last pic...is that a huge cut in the fish?or is it a leaf?
