410418,Dano,2009-12-10 01:51:00,719,"Cause you know I need taken care of, and a lovely job you do I must say!"
410422,The Urban Fisherman,2009-12-10 01:57:00,2050," Irish I'd be glad to hit he ice with you if you'll cook, and fly?"
410423,Dano,2009-12-10 02:01:00,719, He knows there would be a passel of angry   wimmen lookin for him if he didnt!
410427,JohnF,2009-12-10 02:11:00,3494," Hell. Even I would be glad to share my wealth of fishing knowledge if he'd fly me to remote spots no man has ever fished before. I'd even bring the scotch, and I'd cook, and wash his sox, and his shirts, and his - no, he'd have to bring lotsa underwear. I draw the line at skivvies, even my own. That's my wife's job. Mebbe if there was room in the plane she could come along. Don't tell her I said this.  JF"
409564,The Urban Fisherman,2009-12-08 01:54:00,2050,"With Ginny's blessings I managed to scoop myself up a new toy for a good price...  I know I'm going to hear ""I told you so"" from a few of you guys...   My daughter asked me if we could set up our Clam 2000 in the living room and I didn't even hesitate!      So, being new to owning a hut of any kind.  What do I need in order to have an easy going, and safe trip out with the kid?  Happy Holidays, and bring on the ICE!  Cheers, Ryan"
409590,trapshooter,2009-12-08 02:34:00,1234,Mr. Buddy style propane heater.

409630,irishfield,2009-12-08 03:39:00,26272,Then he's gonna need a pee bucket...
409641,GBW,2009-12-08 04:07:00,8460,"I have the Coleman Black Cat heater, hanging LED lights (clam has one with a fan built in) but I picked up a few a $ramma for 2 each without the fan...  just some ideas for ya Ryan..."
409681,Fisherman,2009-12-08 12:04:00,7201,"A good set of ice anchors, store bought or home made, keeps the tent and kids where you left them."
409702,bubbles,2009-12-08 13:38:00,591,"As opposed to the heater I opt for the latern, tons of controllable heat plus you get the light when you need it.  Other than that I don't bring much.  Chair, tackle and go!"
409722,motion,2009-12-08 14:31:00,403,"Hey Ryan,  I have the same hut. Your gonna love it!!   I take my son and his buddy and we fish comfortably in the hut.   I have a Mr. Buddy heater (I keep on low for most of the time). I made one upgrade to my hut. Are you towing it out with a sled or ATV or walking out with it?  Tony"

409753,Headhunter,2009-12-08 15:15:00,5703,"I would bring a decent sized magnet and a length of string to try and pick up what myself and my child, dropped down the hole! HH"
409758,Fish Farmer,2009-12-08 15:23:00,2234,"ATV or Snowmobile for pulling, lots of snacks for the kids, catching fish will be a bonus. Enjoy the little guys!!!"
409761,Jet,2009-12-08 15:48:00,364,"Loving having my small butane stove for fresh cups of coffee, continental breakfast and sausages for lunch/dinner and even the occasional fresh fish fry."
409816,Spiel,2009-12-08 17:59:00,9065,"Kids and water (minnow pails) can only mean one thing, wet hands. I always have a few kitchen type towels with me for drying hands on."
409818,Dano,2009-12-08 18:18:00,719, I concur. Nothing like a warm meal out on the ice.
409820,MuskyBill,2009-12-08 18:21:00,311,"This'll be my first year with a portable hut, so I've been wondering the same things.  I picked these up yesterday at BPS, Frabill shelter hooks. I figure anything I can get off the floor & out from under my feet is a good thing. The funny thing about these is BPS only wants $4.99 CDN for a pair. Frabill's website wants $5.99 USD...  "
409822,Spiel,2009-12-08 18:24:00,9065,"  Those are sweet, I'm gonna have to get me some (or make some)."
409930,irishfield,2009-12-08 23:57:00,26272, Yah.. but why do I always have to prepare it for you ??
409958,JohnF,2009-12-09 01:12:00,3494, Buy ya already got a big hole in the ice.  JF
409961,JohnF,2009-12-09 01:16:00,3494, Two sided velcro tape and bungee hooks.  JF
409963,Roy,2009-12-09 01:20:00,13728,You only need four of those if it's a four fish limit.
409965,vinnimon,2009-12-09 01:22:00,2593,
409973,DRIFTER_016,2009-12-09 01:43:00,10439,Everybody has mentioned everything from heaters and tackle to satellite radios. You might want to bring along an auger too. Just sayin'.
409989,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-09 02:41:00,2582,Skates  a puck and some sticks. My kids never really got the fishing bug...but when they where real young and the fish where not co-operating...lacing up the skates for a while was a real crowd pleaser. I also always bring a small shovel. It can be used for snowing in your hut really quickly. And when the kids are out it doubles as a zamboni to clear off a skating area as long as the snow isn't too deep. Or they can dig in a snow bank and play with it for awhile.  Dress em up warm and keep them busy.  Kids with rosy cheeks and sleeping on the way home means you had a good day.
410073,The Urban Fisherman,2009-12-09 11:43:00,2050,"This is all good stuff guys!  Thanks for the pointers... and the laughs..  I haven't the time to reply to all of you right now, but keep 'em comin!  Cheers, Ryan"
410076,rhare,2009-12-09 12:02:00,387,"  Have to agree with Ben, keeping them warm will keep them happy. I use my mr. Buddy to cook hot dogs and heat stuff on all the time, just be a little creative and you can modify it to a stove/heater  I keep a cheap hand crank radio in my hut, comes in handy sometimes and no let down from dead batteries.  congrats on the new hut!"
