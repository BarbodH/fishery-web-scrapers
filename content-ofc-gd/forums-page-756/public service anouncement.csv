As Ben Franklin said: In wine there is wisdom, In beer there is freedom, In water there is bacteria.  In a number of carefully controlled trials, Scientists have demonstrated that if we drink 1 liter of water each day, At the end of the year we would have absorbed More than 1 kilo of Escherichia coli, (E. Coli) - bacteria Found in feces. In other words, we are consuming 1 kilo of poop..  However, We do NOT run that risk when drinking wine & beer (or tequila, rum, whiskey or other liquor) Because alcohol has to go through a purification process Of boiling, filtering and/or fermenting.  Remember: Water = Poop, Wine = Health . Therefore, it's better to drink wine and talk stupid, Than to drink water and be full of crap.  There is no need to thank me for this valuable information: I'm doing it as a public service!"
