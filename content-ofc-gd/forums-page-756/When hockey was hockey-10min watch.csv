409614,darsky,2009-12-08 03:11:00,586,    Jeez I wonder what sparked it. Gotta love the Nilan square off. He was down twice and bounced right up. Two tough teams at the time
409619,Daplumma,2009-12-08 03:18:00,1961,At what point do they play hockey?
409636,kickingfrog,2009-12-08 04:01:00,8333,"That's not hockey, and never was, maybe someday we will be able to live that era down."
409670,brifishrgy,2009-12-08 10:00:00,559,  that era had some of the best hockey going .. wish half the players that play now had the heart those guys had
409675,Chris,2009-12-08 11:47:00,405,Thanks man. Here's one of my fav's.  
409676,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-08 11:48:00,2582, Yep...what the man said.  Some great hockey back then but I have never been able to figure out what makes people think this has to be part of it.
409678,Chris,2009-12-08 11:50:00,405, Some of you girls need to find a new sport to watch.
409733,Raf,2009-12-08 14:44:00,3495,ahh yes.. compared to today's hockey - where the cheapshot artists don't have anyoen to answer to and try to hurt players wrecklessly.  just say no to instigator.
409742,bigfish1965,2009-12-08 14:57:00,3382," Like Kenny Linseman, you mean? There have always been cheap shot artists. The difference today is the kids are much faster, talented and better athletes."
409743,Raf,2009-12-08 14:59:00,3495,"yes, but the cheapshot artists had to answer to the semenkos, williams, mcsorleys for their actions.  not so today.  a little fear of reprisal is not a bad thing."
409847,kickingfrog,2009-12-08 20:39:00,8333,"Physical hockey is great. Thugs, goons and cheap shot cowards take away from the speed, talent and skill that make the game special."
409868,JohnF,2009-12-08 21:38:00,3494," That era had some of the most entertainig hockey games, but for truly skilled hockey I'll take today's game. As someone said here recently even the Junior game is pretty damned good. Watch one of the Junior games starting Labour Day, then immediately switch to one of the nostalgia channels and catch a pro game from the 60's & 70's. Watch the difference in skating skills, passing, shooting, etc. There were some guys who did some of those things pretty impressively back then, but there are a lot more guys today doing a lot more of those things impressively, and at a younger age. And that's just my not so humble opinion.  JF"
