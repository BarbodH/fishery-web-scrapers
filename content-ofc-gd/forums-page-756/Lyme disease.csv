404850,fisher,2009-11-23 13:01:00,451,"Here is a link to a Doctor who works out of St Catharines who you may want to contact...  http://expertpages.com/details.php/4424_4538_301_121.htm  And here is an interesting article (4 years old) that details an Ontario woman who had a Lyme test done in Ontario that was negative but then was confirmed via US tests for Lyme disease (that Canadian doctors do not do).  http://www.anapsid.org/Lyme/tickingbombcanadalyme.html  Here is an excerpt from that article ""My own doctor, infectious-disease specialist Hovsep Baghdadlian, says that of the 125 people he is currently treating for Lyme disease, only 10 per cent tested positive on Ontario tests. Like me, many doctors treating Lyme disease have turned to specialized labs in the U.S. But some Canadian doctors are loath to recognize foreign tests.""   And here is another story done this year by CTV...and another excerpt.  http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/stor...0608?hub=Health  Within a couple of months, he became weak, plagued with headaches and eventually had to stop working. He went to 18 doctors, internists and neurologists and all of them missed the diagnosis, with some telling him his illness was all in his head.  Even though he had tests for everything -- including a test for Lyme disease -- all of it came back negative.  ""It was a difficult time, not understanding why I was getting sick. My doctor thought it was a sinus infection but it continued to get worse,"" he says.  It took a year and a half and a specialized test to confirm he had Lyme disease. To treat the illness, Manten gives himself infusions of antibiotics twice a day. Four years later, he says he feels better, but is not free of the illness; he still has intense fatigue and has not returned to his job as an engineer.  Family doctor Dr. Ben Boucher, who has treated many patients with Lyme disease at his practice in Port Hawkesbury, N.S., says Manten's is a common story.  ""There are a considerable number of patients being undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, and therefore not treated,"" he says.  ""It's a concern because these patients get more ill as time goes on,"" says Boucher, noting that patients can develop facial palsy, cardiac issues and progress to nerve damage and inflammation of the brain and spinal cord.  ""It is quite treatable and easily treatable [with antibiotics], but as it goes on into phase 2 and 3, it becomes more difficult to treat.""  Part of the problem is that the standard blood test for Lyme disease is notoriously unreliable. It fails to detect the infection 20 per cent of the time."
404852,Spiel,2009-11-23 13:10:00,9065,Hi Tambo  I do indeed know two people who have Lyme disease. They both had numerous misdiagnosis until they got into see a Dr. who specializes in Lyme disease. He had their blood samples sent to California for testing as apparently the screening process here is often less than adequate. The cost if I remember correctly was $600.00 and not covered by OHIP. But with the correct diagnosis they are now getting the treatment they need.  I certainly hope you get to the root of your troubles quickly and get the treatment you need.
404917,tambo,2009-11-23 17:01:00,85,"thanks ph the internet is a double edged sword.  reading up on diseases can scare the crap out of you, but it can also open some doors, as it did for me with lyme.  otherwise, i would have accepted the ALS fate  mike "

405168,ehg,2009-11-24 16:05:00,2666,"  Had the same symptoms back in March of 2001. Went to doctors many, many times and they came to no conclusions. Finally i had a brain MRI and went to see a neurologist who said with great indifference ""Maybe you have Multiple Sclerosis, i don't know"". Turns out i did have MS presenting itself. Not that anyone reached this conclusion until i saw an opthamologist years later who said this was the case. Now it has created disability. Hopefully you don't have ALS but be persistent in getting a diagnosis, unfortunately few will care but you."
405244,splashhopper,2009-11-24 22:10:00,2931,"  Heh EHG..... not sure if you saw the article about MS on CTV and the major networks across North America  It provides some hope http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/nation...article1372414/   As for ""few caring""..... my mother -in-law had Lou Gehrigs disease before she passed away and we were the Primary caregivers for her.  Many in the medical system DO care.... very few don't .... it's all in ones own outlook upon life and the cards they are dealt with as to how we will be treated.  Grandma got involved with a study at UWO under Dr Strong's care ... that team is very caring... considering that they KNOW where that disease takes most of their patients...  They were very interested in Grandma participating in the study because she happened to have lived in the two places with the highest incidence of ALS per capita worldwide. ( the island of Guam and the city of Woodstock, Ontario) a) She was in a prison camp on the Island of Guam as a young girl for almost 2 years.. She lived here in London for 5 years.   Grandma was an inspiration to all in our family and to the health team.... she came from a very poor family in the Phillipines and rarely complained about what ""she didn't have"".  She had a tough time at the start of the process accepting her fate( anybody would), but once she did she showed what she was made of and who she truly was. A leader to her family and friends. An inspiration of courage and gratefulness to all the medical teams involved in her care.. in the hospital and at home..  She showed her family how to prepare for the inevitable.... she made her amends to people, face to face, before she lost her voice.   I was very hesitant to participate in this thread as I don't want to crush anyone's hopes of not having the brutal disease of ALS..  BUT, I couldn't stay quiet once you mentioned "" few care"".... ( medically or in general) This forum is showing its true family values and the sense of personal community that we have for one another for one.  I don;t pretend to know what is like to be in your shoes.... but I sure know what it was like on the days that grandma had a pity party shortly after she was diagnosed.  Dr Strong gave us ""permission to take care of the caregivers too""  If I can be of service to you during this period of your life, please do not hesitate to contact me in a PM.... I will do what I can.  Sincerely and God Bless  Splashhopper"

Might be worth talking to someone with first hand experience in the matter. If you'd like his phone number shoot me a PM.  As a cautionary measure I ought to warn you, he'll talk your ear off."

404691,tambo,2009-11-22 18:18:00,85,"hello ofners i am wondering if anyone has had experience with lyme disease.  over the last few months, i have been experiencing debilitating health issues.  It's hard for me to talk about this, but i've been given a 'probable ALS' diagnosis.  for those that don't know that is lou gehrig's disease, and is fatal.  this has been crushing for me.  i just turned 30, and up until april, i was very active.  i'm an avid hunter and fisherman, and spent every weekend last year hunting and fishing.  this year, i can hardly walk and am losing function of my hands.   i am wondering if anyone here has known anyone with lyme.  from my research, lyme ultimately impairs the nervous system, and has known to mimic ALS, MS, parkinsons, etc.  the problem i have found is many doctors don[t know much about it.  my neuro was indifferent when i asked him about it.  i went for  a blood test for lyme last week, and have the follow up tomorrow. my undeerstanding is that it[s difficult to detect in the standard blood test.  if anyone has any guidance, please let me know thanks tambo"
404692,Joey,2009-11-22 18:22:00,9122,I researched this before.  Did you have a bullseye shaped mark anywhere on your body recently?  The tick that gives you the lyme disease leaves a bullseye shaped mark on your body where it bites/burrows in to you.  Usually that is the tell-tale sign.  Joey
404694,Flyboy,2009-11-22 18:27:00,26,Check out this CTV W5 piece on Lyme Disease last week. Canadian doctors are not expecting this disease here so they are ruling it out as a possible cause . . .  http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/stor...91114?s_name=W5
404695,tambo,2009-11-22 18:27:00,85,"hey joey i don[t remember the rash, but it could have been on my head or back.. also, through my research i found that less than 50% of those infected remembered the rash."
404698,tambo,2009-11-22 18:30:00,85,"hey flyboy, i've watched the vid.  from my research it seems that lyme is very common, but it's hard to find docs that really understand it."
404699,Flyboy,2009-11-22 18:35:00,26,Lets hope your blood test results give you a definitive answer tomorrow . . . Was the test requested by your MD or on your own?

404704,timmeh,2009-11-22 19:11:00,609,"You should absolutely go to see a lyme specialist. Ask your doctor for a referral. Someone who I work with went through a very similar thing. They're just returning to work and I don't know this person well but based on what others have to told me it was a problem getting a correct diagnosis, as they thought it was something else.  And fyi you are correct a rash is not always present and the standard blood tests can return false negatives. It can be tough to accurately diagnose. Demand that your doc sends you to see someone. If he seems unwilling to believe you, search the Canadian lyme disease website. I believe they have some specialists listed. You should probably check this site out anyway.  http://www.canlyme.com/"
404708,tambo,2009-11-22 19:25:00,85,"thanks timmeh believe me, ive exhausted all the websites.  i've even had my gal talk to a veterinarian friend and she says it's very tough to find even in animals.  if you can, ask that work person where he or she went, because my research has shown there are few lyme literate docs around.  i find it hard to believe i'm dying, but that possibility is driving me nuts"
404709,Guest gbfisher,2009-11-22 19:35:00,0,I was bitten by a tick while hunitng. I did get a bullseye mark around the bite. I had tests to see if I indeed did get it. I was told to wait in order to see as tests can come back Neg. or Pos. .. in early stages. It's extremely hard to diagnose...It takes many tests to find out and can mimic hundreds of different diseases. Its a hard one for sure from what I understand. Keep on them to find out if you think that is what you have. No one will look if you do not ask and be forward about it. Good luck.
404712,tambo,2009-11-22 19:45:00,85,"thanks gb like i said, i had to ask for the test, and i have the second test tomorrow i expect it will come back negative, but it won't stop me if i have it, it has progressed to the neuro level  did you just have the regular blood test for it? thanks"
404716,Guest gbfisher,2009-11-22 20:00:00,0,Yes. Just a regular test was done.

404740,musky_man,2009-11-22 21:10:00,159,"Tambo,   I work for the communicable disease division of Toronto Public Health and deal with a few cases of Lyme disease every year.  First I have a few questions:  1) Have you been genetically tested for ALS?  That will rule in/out that potential diagnosis quickly.  2) What exactly have you been experiencing?  3) Do you recall a ""bulls-eye"" rash in your past.  Important to know however that not all people have this rash.   TESTING  Your doctor might run two tests for lyme disease. One is called and ELISA the other is called a Western Blot.  The Western Blot is a more  senstive version of the ELISA.  These tests look for antibodies to the bacteria that case the infection.  There are 2 classes of antibodies they look for: 1gG and IgM.  If you have IgG antibodies and no IgM, then it suggests you have been infected, but in the past.  If you have IgM and no IgG, is suggests a more current infection.  Past infeciotn would/can cause very bizarre neurological symptoms.  If it is Lyme disease, then it is treatable with long courses of antibiotics, but the earlier the better.  The other thing you might consider, although it is a long shot, is West Nile virus -- it can cause all sorts of weird neurological manifestations.  Again - easily tested via a blood test where they look for IgG and IgM antibodies to WNV.  Hope that is some help and good luck.  Mark"
404742,musky_man,2009-11-22 21:13:00,159,"Fkyboy,  The Ontario Ministry of Health and LongTerm Care have been looking at Lyme disease much more closely over the last 3 years and they are tracking and mapping areas all throughout Ontario. Also - doctors are being made more aware as well.  Mark    "

404847,Jer,2009-11-23 12:09:00,1426,"I've had similiar symptoms (trouble walking, weak hands, poor balance) that have been steadily worsening for the last few years.  After being referred to a neurologist, I was diagnosed with a form of muscular dystrophy called Charcot Marie Toothe disease. Very similiar symptoms to MS, but not near as severe or progressive. ALS was never a consideration, but so many disorders exhibit similiar symptoms, doctors barely know where to start. The rapid onset of your symptoms seems to indicate an infection rather than genetic (but I'm certainly not an MD). I've suffered from related symptoms most of my life, but only really started feeling severe effects in my late 30s.  I hope you get an accurate diagnosis soon and appropriate treatment. So far, the only treatment available for my condition has been preventative, various braces and ankle supports (basically just to keep me from breaking my neck).  Whatever the outcome, all you can do is soldier on..."
