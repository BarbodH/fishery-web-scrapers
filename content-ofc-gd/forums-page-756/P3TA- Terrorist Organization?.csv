409788,Dano,2009-12-08 17:19:00,719,"War on Vegetarians  P3TA is not the most popular kid on the block. Between antagonizing meat-eaters and radicalizing the use of naked ad campaigns, the animal rights group has made more than a couple enemies.   This is the first time, however, that the lawful, nonviolent organization has been officially classified as a “terrorist threat.”   In a new security form circulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the federal department asks animal experimentation facilities whether they’ve been confronted by a handful of “terrorist”  groups, including the Earth Liberation Front, known for their use of arson and explosives; the Animal Liberation Front, which popularized property destruction as a form of protest; and, yes, P3TA — best known for distributing gory videos of factory farming.   While the USDA form doesn’t necessarily signal anything, some fear repercussions. Will Potter at Green Is The New Red suggests that P3TA’s new classification may point to a change in the government’s willingness to charge nonviolent protestors under new antiterror legislation.   Consider the case of Adriana Stumpo, Nathan Pope, Joseph Buddenberg and Maryam Khajavi, who are facing charges under the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act over chanting and intent to sidewalk chalk.   “Industries that rely on factory farming,” explains Brian Merchant on Treehugger.com, “may have the lobbying muscle to get P3TA listed as a terrorist threat for their benefit.”"
409798,Terry,2009-12-08 17:26:00,14456,there were/are a fringe group at best and was given legitimacy in news reports by famous stupid actors/actresses  spokespersons  the are   a Terrorist Organization IMHO

P3TA also runs an animal shelter with one of the highest kill rates in the US. http://www.petakillsanimals.com/"
409812,bigugli,2009-12-08 17:46:00,6138,"P3ta also has a history of random act of vandalism and destruction of property, and members have been convicted of criminal offences in relation to their cause. There is also a cross relationship between P3ta and some of the radical fringe groups. If you choose violence or criminal acts to forward your message, or platform, or if you support groups that engage in such activities,  that makes you a terrorist."
409871,JohnF,2009-12-08 21:48:00,3494,"I'd classify them as ecoterrorists, just like Green Peace. It all started out of high ideals but got dirty somewhere along the way.  JF"

410122,POLLIWOGG,2009-12-09 14:52:00,835,If you read the definition of terrorism sent out to our enforcement and military by the US it includes just about anyone that disagrees with the Gov. and tries to influence the Gov. Under their definition they could lock up the official opposition or anyone that doesn't think they should fine people for standing on the sidewalk waiting for a DD.  They were on the way to stuffing the jails with political prisoners.  The Mohawk Nation was on the terrorist list.
410125,bigugli,2009-12-09 15:14:00,6138," That's thanks to the events at Oka. Armed militants ( warrioir societies ) within a community engaging in actions that required military intervention. They took up arms. That makes you the enemy, regardless of right or wrong."
