409415,irishfield,2009-12-07 17:46:00,26272,..of the sport that is. What's that.. did someone yell addiction ??  
409419,Whopper,2009-12-07 18:04:00,2174,"Is that your path for tomorrow?????    Had a light dusting here this morning just in time for rush hour traffic....what a nightmare, just glad I get to work before most people get up"
409422,Roy,2009-12-07 18:08:00,13728,"Good job. Do those docks stay out there all winter, Wayne?"
409425,Spiel,2009-12-07 18:29:00,9065,"Some might say your just ""plain ole nuts!""  I wouldn't be one of them."
409434,irishfield,2009-12-07 19:37:00,26272, Dock is pulled at the ramp.. you have to jump into the bow once I nose her up for ya! Docks across the channel are the sailing club... on steel pilons and yes they stay all winter.
409439,Terry,2009-12-07 20:00:00,14456,a man has to do what a man has to do
409462,ciceri,2009-12-07 22:10:00,535,"Lol nice. I think i'll take the sled out for a spin this weekend, I'll race you along the shoreline"
409466,bigugli,2009-12-07 22:30:00,6138,As long as there be fishing to be done and tall tales to tell....
409467,Sinker,2009-12-07 22:32:00,8692,"Must be nice......I have to shovel!!!  Theres not enough snow there for me to bother with yet though, I 'd just lock 'er in and giver in that little dusting  S."
409470,fishinguypat,2009-12-07 22:42:00,547,is that a lake huron trib
409478,irishfield,2009-12-07 23:09:00,26272," Problem is its soaking wet snow... and instant ice when you drive on it. Slicker than.. well you know...and a 4000+ lb boat to back down it.... pull up it, and I'd rather not do an OPP style launch if ya know what I mean.. lol"
409479,irishfield,2009-12-07 23:09:00,26272, I guess you could say YES !
409484,Ron,2009-12-07 23:18:00,1683,Wayne Wayne Wayne......  Wouldn't be a whole lot easier to just troll with the plane instead? ha ha ha  I am hoping to get one more kick at the can myself this weekend. With any luck I ain't gonna hook into rough sawn lumber though! ha ha ha
409487,johnnyb,2009-12-07 23:22:00,3413,"Lookin' good, Wayne.  Not exactly the time of year for it now...but are people allowed to fish from shore there?"
409490,irishfield,2009-12-07 23:25:00,26272,Usually a guy sitting on the pier end every time we go to launch at 8am. Don't know if he ever catches anything.. he won't conversa...
409494,johnnyb,2009-12-07 23:28:00,3413,Well there ya go...I wonder if he's related to the guys that always seem to be sitting at the Port Credit pier...never seeming to catch anything...all year...any time of day or night...
409507,Handlebarz,2009-12-08 00:09:00,3790,Dang Wayne next time I will take a pic and show ya hows its really done this time of year with the mini van I have no trouble launching and always hope my buddy is home so he can pull me out with his big Dodge was very glad he was home last weekend heck its no effort for him at all and with the extra length my stuck van gives he does not need to go down the launch. Maybe I need to invest in a 4X4 next season.
409541,Sinker,2009-12-08 01:20:00,8692," Yeah, I hear ya. My boat is only a quarter that weight, and my subaru can climb pretty much anything  Ice......well.....not so much  S."
409552,Bernie,2009-12-08 01:31:00,3190,Brrrr. Boating and below freezing temps = frozen body parts. If it keeps up another week or two and the sleds will be on the lake up here.
409553,irishfield,2009-12-08 01:34:00,26272,Our bay in Temagami iced over last night Bernie... now if the snow just holds off with the temps that are coming late in the week we'll have some good ice.  I figure this is our last 2009 tour on Georgian Bay in the boat.. can't complain I guess...
409554,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-12-08 01:38:00,1362,Lucky You Wayne!!!....I had tears in my eyes taking the pontoon out of the water yesterday
409570,Bernie,2009-12-08 02:04:00,3190," I haven't been out or talked to anyone on the lake for a couple of days so I don't know the ice status. A friend on the lake recently bought an enclosed cab airboat, wants me to put a block heater in it. I'm looking forward to a ride in that one."
409746,tonyb,2009-12-08 15:04:00,1637,Way to make use of the plow...I like it!  Could always leave the truck on the ramp with your trailer submerged...keeps the bunk carpets thawed at least.  Doesn't look like there will be a lineup of boats to launch at this time of year up there  Tony
409752,Fish Farmer,2009-12-08 15:10:00,2234,FISH and Talk about it with good Buddys.
