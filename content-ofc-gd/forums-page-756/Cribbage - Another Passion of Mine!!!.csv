409234,Leecher,2009-12-07 01:06:00,7832,"This past few days, been busy making a cribbage board, another passion of mine and one of it's kind.  Thought I'd use one of the plaque I made last fall.  Had an idea and proceeded to it.  Got the first coat of white on    and a second    Since I made this plaque last year after deer hunting, thought I'd stay with the same theme.  Only thing I could think of was ""SCOPE"" and ""TARGET"".  After numerous attempt at creating one, finally came up with this one    It seemed to be quite fitting for what I was feeling and wanted to do.  After a dry fitting for the look and feel, got to the painting stage    Once this done, had to begin touch ups so that it looks clean.  Here a shot after    Then added the year to it at the bottom    Now that was the easy part a couple of days later     Next step would be figuring out the layout of the game.  Had numerous attempts but after a whole day of trying, this is what I came up with..... this is the template I had finally done for it    Secured it to the piece and started punching the holes with a nail and hammer..... this is another step that is quite time consuming   Once this done, proceeded to drill the holes with the press-drill for a couple of hours    Here's the results     Now for the pegs used aluminum rivets, dipped them into tremclad in different colors in pairs.  Don't have a pic of them but you can see them it the next pic    Now all that remains is the final painting and 3 coats of varnish, then it's good to go Hope you enjoy Leechman"

Think he put some smaller logs on it for legs, lacquered it up, etc.  nice work!"

410142,Jonny,2009-12-09 16:11:00,1380,"Having made a couple of much simpler game boards for a ""PIG"" game, I can appreciate the tremendous amount of patience you must have had to lay out and drill all the holes so precisely!  Nice job, Jacques!  29's to you!"
410218,Leecher,2009-12-09 19:27:00,7832, Merci Dan!!!   Thanks dizzidevil!!!   Thanks Jocko!!!  Patience is a virtue and precision is a must.... that is why I created a template for the layout of the holes
410277,bubbles,2009-12-09 21:05:00,591,"Great Job. Question - any special varnish you use ofer the paint.  I have not had good luck varnishing a painted surface, orange peeled once and the other time a coffee cup removed the paint and varnish 3 weeks later.  No idea why, paint was dried for 3 days prior to varnishing, too short?"
410379,Leecher,2009-12-09 23:41:00,7832," Thanks Bubbles!!!  Nothing special, just Varathane Diamond Wood Finish water based.  Varathane oil based is what I used in the past but it took too long to dry in between coats and over time would turn yellow.  The water based will not.  It goes on white and dries to a perfect clear coat.  I also use water based paint and lay a couple of coats.  Maybe in your case, you needed a primer coat to have your paint adhere to it  Hope this helps you out Leechman"
