408683,limeyangler,2009-12-05 05:50:00,5204,"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.......thats a sigh of relief  Woke up this morning to the wonderful sight of a completely iced over lake....its been a long time coming.  Its amazing how just a slight variation in weather conditions produces such a dramatic transformation within hours.  Our lake has been ready to go for weeks now. Its started to ice up only for warmer temps to kick in and wind to dissipate what ice had formed.  last week saw temperatures dip quite a bit, was minus temps during the day (average -3 or 4) with minus 10 during at night, only problem was the northerly winds bringing the cold air were pretty strong so only the back bays were skimmed.  Last night saw the wind finally drop and by the time the light was fading you could see the ice forming in the main bay right before your eyes...it was that quick!  After snapping a few pictures in front of the house i was pumped and I decided to go check out a couple of walleye lakes within 20 mins drive from me and those lakes were encouraging too.....only around 1-2 inches on all.....and that was close to shore.....but if the 5 day report is accurate i'll be drilling holes by next weekend.  I'll be wearing my PFD and icepicks though and wont be going alone....even with this late ice up ( 3 weeks later than last year) i aint gonna risk my life for the sake of fishing, i'm good on 4 inches of black ice...new ice.....anything less i'll wait a couple more days thanks....lol.   WEATHER FOR THE NEXT 5 DAYS....HOPEFULLY      IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE THIS MORNING               SMALL LAKE 10 MINUTES AWAY         ANOTHER LARGER LAKE 20 MINS AWAY               RAN INTO THIS GUY HUNTING CRITTERS ON OUR DRIVEWAY COMING HOME                        Cant wait till next weekend.......i'll be inching my way out all week checking ice thickness in front of the house, i'll be tying a rope round the small pine you can see in the first pic though!"
408689,BassAsin,2009-12-05 05:57:00,806,not fair!    hahah i have about 20 feet of ice out from shore on my small pike lake!   i want ice!  i hope to see a hardwater report from you soon simon!  good luck this coming season  Matt!
408695,Kingsalmon,2009-12-05 07:44:00,107,"Wow, you're really anxious to get out.  Looking at your weather forecast, it shouldn't take too long.  By next weekend you'll have ten inches of ice.  Good luck."
408714,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-05 13:57:00,2582, Rubbing it in like that won't get you on my Christmas card list Simon  Can you tell I'm jealous as all get out.  Good luck next weekend...you...you...icehole  Looking forward to a hardwater report!
408715,Rich Clemens,2009-12-05 14:10:00,3131,That should make a number of folks on the board happy ... seeing pics like that.   We got our first dusting this morning.  Cool pics to view (thanks).
408718,cranks bait,2009-12-05 14:22:00,721,That is great news to hear.  I do not want the ice here yet as I am still wanting to do a lot of duck hunting on the river.  Hearing that you are freezing over up there is a great sign for me.
408722,johnnyb,2009-12-05 14:26:00,3413,"WOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     Best news I've read all week!!!  Once you're on...we're hopefully only a week or two behind!!  And at the very least, I'll have some reports to read!!! Awesome pics of the fox, too"
408732,Spiel,2009-12-05 15:09:00,9065,You may very well be the first to get up an icefishing report this season Simon and I'm looking forward to it. Good luck and be safe.
408791,Dara,2009-12-05 19:58:00,3052,"I sure hope some of that weather drifts down this way...tighten the lakes up nice, then dump some snow on them"
408930,moparhawk,2009-12-06 04:10:00,146,"Limey I've been to Dryden many times on my way to Perrault.  Just curious what lake are you on (wabigoon?) And what is it like to winter there? By comparison here in Kansas we may get at best 11-15 days of safe ice, and we generally chase crappies. I tell myself every year I want to find a place to icefish but never manage it."
409069,hockeyplayerz_14,2009-12-06 18:48:00,160,I want to see a nice report and the weather is BEAUTIFUL!!!! What fish are you after?
409073,MCTFisher9120,2009-12-06 18:54:00,3761,"Ah, can't wait for Scugog and Balsam to freeze up for us!!"
409273,The Urban Fisherman,2009-12-07 02:25:00,2050,"that's awesome Simon!  I just started ice fishing the last two seasons, and really got into it last year.  I can't wait for my local ponds to start freezing up.  I was out on Lake Erie (long point bay) last christmas but I seriously doubt that'll be happening this year... Good luck and be safe dude!"
409279,Leecher,2009-12-07 02:40:00,7832,You lucky dawg   J/K Over here not much ice so far...... but winds are from the North West and dipping below zero at night.  Guess it won't be long now     But I still think you're lucky Simon Jacques
409287,Mike the Pike,2009-12-07 03:09:00,3421,Ah good news Simon that means you should be the first to show us an ice fishing report.  Now get out the Zamboni clear the ice and invite us up for a game of Hockey and Ice fishing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yeah...i bet your dying to be outfished by the one who goes by the name 'LJ' ....just kiddin buddy, glad its good news for you too....its made my life a whole lot more bareable....i'm enjoying the extra time with baby jack...but the fishing withdrawals are bad at the moment.    I hope so Chris, not cuz i wanna beat anyone to it...i'm just desperate for some good (or bad) fishing   goin nuts waiting!    We aint had much snow at all...if it carries on like this i'll be wishin i had an ATV!    Yes MPH...i'm on Wabigoon, winters are long and cold...jan /feb probably averages minus 25 C, so you better like icefishing if ya live up here....lol.    Anything that wants to bite.....first trip will be walleye, just because trout doesn't open till Jan 1st, next trip out i'll try for whitefish and walleye, but as soon as trout season opens...thats my real icefishing passion.       Yeah Ryan, the weather is crazy this year eh? I'll be safe too.....i'm keen....not suicical....lol, always go with a buddy first couple of times out.  You taking Avery with ya icefishing again?....i cant wait till Jack is a bit older......god i hope he likes fishing as mmuch as your clan!     Yeah, i'm blessed living here....and i get out as often as possible so i dont take it for granted !  Thanks Jacques...looking forward to your reports, you taking your daughter out again...that was an excellent report....i loved that post....you 2 have the exact same smile.     LOL...i should steal (oooops...i meant borrow) the Zamboni from the Arena, drive it down Van Horne avenue to the ice road and across to my bay. My wife cleared a patch a couple of years ago....it was tough going to keep it good, flooded it with the auger...but its so freekin' cold the water turned to slush right away usually, not a very even surface,,,,then there's the snow....cant we just ice fish?....lol  SHE DID A GOOD JOB, BUT A ZAMBONI WOULD HELP....LOL    "
409441,Leecher,2009-12-07 20:03:00,7832, Sure will Simon.... she really enjoyed it last year
409521,frozen-fire,2009-12-08 00:41:00,542,Sweet shots of a very nice fox. Are all of them that nice looking up there? The ones down here are mostly all skinny and don't look that great.  Have a great season on the hard stuff!
409869,ciceri,2009-12-08 21:38:00,535,"That right there is what my dreams are made of, lol."
