It's a good way to enjoy and share my memories from the sport i love!  2009 was a great year for me, I got to do lots of fishing, I got engaged, I bought a new pickup... I cant ask for much more.  So here goes,  I hadnt done a ton of ice fishing in previous years, maybe 10-12 times per season, but this year, I stepped it up and I got out every day that I could, I really started to enjoy it.  I had some great memories and got to share some amazing days on the ice with good friends and family.  Kelli and I started our season with a trip to Little Lake, she loves catching pike after pike, so we always do it a couple times per season    Then we switched to Simcoe for lakers and whities       Annual group trip to Nipissing was a blast as always   But, back to Simcoe     Lots more, but I cant post em all lol  Didnt really do any spring steelheading this year, only got out once and only have cell phone pics of the good ones  Last saturday in April however, I needed to get my speck feed on.  Had a garage sale in the morning and took the afternoon to stomp the forest in search of some speckies.  Landed about a dozen, kept 4 for the pan that night.  Dont like to keep many, but once or twice a year I cant help myself   I also love me a perch feed, and Kelli loves fishing for em.  We got out a bunch this year off of Innisfil and we ate lots of perch this spring.  No massive fish, but lots of solid eaters.    Pike season rolled around, and I always love pike season!  Opening day was 60km/h winds and thunderstorms, I went to work instead.  The next nice day I took Kelli and a couple of friends to Couchiching in search of some gators, and gators we found.    Did some fishing up in the Muskokas as well...         Jigging for lakers was new for me, and when I client called asking to do it, I was hesitant but he trusted me and wasnt dissapointed    Then my favourite time of year, bass season.....     Happy clients         Livewell incident led to some dead fish in the tourney, first time in a long time and VERY dissapointing, still won though!     New club record! and 1st place  1st place again, I got on a roll  2nd place       I may get out steelheading once or twice before December wraps up, but that was my 09 season!  Hope you enjoyed, I know I did!"
