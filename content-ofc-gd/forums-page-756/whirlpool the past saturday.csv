409417,MJL,2009-12-07 17:57:00,2427,"I absolutely love the whirlpool.  The scenery there is magnificent.  Really tempted to get down there myself this winter for the steelhead.  It’s great you could hook up with Vinnimon.  A few years ago, CharlieD took my dad and I down to the pool for our first trip there for steelhead...I will forever appreciate that gesture and he’s probably the reason I have yet to blank down there for the bows.  I still remember my first trip down there for carp like it was yesterday as well as my first trip there for steelhead…It really pays to chat with the locals who fish down there for the steelhead…They’ve shown nothing but kindness and hospitality to me each trip I’ve gone down during steelhead season and gave me great tips.  They put me onto some minnow patterns that worked great (like Gulp and some local streamer ties).  The walk down and then up again is always worth it in my books  The whirlpool has quickly become one of my new happy places "
