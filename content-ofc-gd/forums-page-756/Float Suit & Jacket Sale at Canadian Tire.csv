For those who don't know Helly Hansen owns Nautilus which is why this float suit is just like the HH Delta.   Here's the links:  Float Suit -$219.99 http://www.canadiantire.ca/browse/product_...D=1260286008634  Float Jacket - $159.99 http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/Sp...ater%2BCoat.jsp   For those who go, good luck finding one!"
