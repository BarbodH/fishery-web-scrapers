409915,Rizzo,2009-12-08 23:37:00,4754," Agreed. The niagara has been very stingy to me this fall and I was hoping for one last shot. If the weatherman was wrong I'll be there, but all forecasts point to some big winds the next few days."
405238,Rizzo,2009-11-24 21:49:00,4754,"Not sure if this has been posted yet as I haven't been around much lately, but usually a group of us get together for the musky closer in mid december. I don't know what the closing date is this year, but do we have any interested parties? Last year we even got a few fish (compared to the previous 5 years!). Hopefully we can get a feel here for who might be interested, and who might have a spot in their boat. By the way, if Wayne is coming and has room, you definitely want to get in his ride, pretty sure there is a barbecue and jacuzzi tub on board."
405241,lew,2009-11-24 22:03:00,12766,"I'll be passing this year Roger, infact this'll be the 1st one I've ever missed, but I'm re-doing the whole house and am gonna be busy for awhile.  I've even put all the fish'n gear away for the season."
405268,Rizzo,2009-11-24 23:08:00,4754,"sorry to hear that Lew. If you change your mind close to that date maybe you can hop in with someone else! I've got accustomed over the years to seeing you and Pete troll past and give the ""thumbs down""...we've had some nasty conditions and poor results over the years haven't we! I've been to the Niagara 4 times this fall and it has only coughed up one fish for me"
405272,HTHM,2009-11-24 23:30:00,4082,Let me know the date and I will have seat in my boat.
405350,cram,2009-11-25 04:58:00,1733,"I would love to get out -- haven't been once this fall.  No boat (within a 4 hr drive, anyway) but if timing works and someone has a seat open count me in."
405428,Squid,2009-11-25 16:56:00,1656,saturday the 12th of december is closer.
405429,irishfield,2009-11-25 17:03:00,26272,"I know what you mean Pete... Last day for the weekenders that need to go to Church on Sunday. Season closes on the Tuesday.. 15th.  Roger.. too Funny.. no to the jacuzzi, unless of course we get too far down river!!"
405443,lew,2009-11-25 17:41:00,12766," Hey Pete, if you were any kind of pal you'd ferget about the Niagara trip this year, grab your paint brush, and come spend that weekend with me. Lotsa painting for everybody"
405508,glen,2009-11-25 21:49:00,2641,My boat is put away so i guess i will walk down and fish from shore.
405565,Rizzo,2009-11-26 01:04:00,4754,"Although I've never seen anyone do it, there is plenty of deep water near shore up by Frenchman's creek"
405708,Squid,2009-11-26 16:56:00,1656,"  Yeah Ok Lew, be right there...."
405895,Rizzo,2009-11-27 01:12:00,4754,"  here's the one I got last year at the g2g. Didn't like the hold I had on the fish, set him back in the water to get a better hold (and let it catch its breath) and the thing took off like a shot...no chance for less awkward pose! Got to love the cold water catch/release. If I remember correctly, water temps last year were around 38 degrees, and we used Wayne's barge as an icebreaker at the boat launch. I plan to be there Saturday December 12. Anyone else in for that day?"
405903,irishfield,2009-11-27 01:25:00,26272,"Won't be there if the ramp is still open, to Georgian Bay, Roger !"
405913,Rizzo,2009-11-27 01:49:00,4754,Season closes same day up there?
405914,irishfield,2009-11-27 01:53:00,26272,Yep.. 15th !
405915,misfish,2009-11-27 01:56:00,29133,"You musky guys kill me   .Slip yer boat in the water and troll allllllllll day for a bigggggggggg,n. Here I walk and sit,and walk and sit, look,n for a big ol buck.  We aint that all different are we?   Lew dont for get,,wax on,wax off ,up, down,no, side to side"
405929,e-z-out,2009-11-27 02:58:00,1052,Well i had a blast last yeah so if it's still on i would be willing to go again this year.
409405,Squid,2009-12-07 17:06:00,1656,So who is up for the closer G2G on the upper this weekend?
409406,irishfield,2009-12-07 17:09:00,26272,I'm a definite no Peter. I just plowed the ramp in Midland so we can use it tomorrow! Hopefully we can still get out for closing day as well.  Wayne
409408,Squid,2009-12-07 17:11:00,1656,Good luck Wayne and be careful out there bud.
409431,Beans,2009-12-07 18:59:00,3339, Did you finally get it dried out ???
409503,Squid,2009-12-07 23:57:00,1656,This Saturday December the 12th. 7AM at the marina launch on the upper.
409534,Rizzo,2009-12-08 01:03:00,4754,"just a bit of an update. I was on the upper this past saturday. Water wasn't quite chocolate milk, but wasn't great either. Visibility was around 18 inches when we started, and about 2 feet by the end of the day. I'm going to keep an eye on the winds for Wed, Thurs, Fri before making my final decision about making the drive from Barrie. Right now its not looking too good unfortunately."
409536,Hellfish,2009-12-08 01:11:00,308,"High winds and rain in the forecast for wednesday, she might stay blown for awhile."
409885,tnt,2009-12-08 22:12:00,63,"It'll most likely be blown for the weekend, I live only 20 minutes and am not planning on heading out.  It's quite disappointing!"
