409324,turtle,2009-12-07 11:59:00,274,Now that its almost hardwater season I thought it was safe to post an icefishing question.  I'll be staying on Couch around Cumberland Beach mid-January.  I've fished Couch in the early winter before out from Airport Rd on the east side close to the islands and did OK on the perch.  Can anyone give me some directions on the west side?  I will be walking.  Walk straight out and start looking or are there any areas to concentrate on?  Thanks.

My grandparents used to live on the lake( turn off hwy 11 at bramshot, left at the lake , last place on the lake at the end of the dead end)  I know theres decent perch out there about 150 yards or so. Its all shallow then drops off really fast. Got lots on the drop off. I havent fished any other areas tho.  Good luck ."
409523,turtle,2009-12-08 00:42:00,274,Thanks.  Not exactly sure as its a rental and someone else is organizing it.  I've got a hydrographic map and dont mind searching for the perch.  Depends on the day and weather and how far I want to walk.
