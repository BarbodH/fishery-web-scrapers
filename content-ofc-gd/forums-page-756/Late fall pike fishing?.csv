What type of bait should I be using?  Ie: live( types ?) or lures ( types and how)   Thanks  Splashhopper"

409164,danjang,2009-12-06 22:26:00,148,This doesn't help at all I bet but they don't take roe bags. I saw one in about a foot of water just sitting there doing nothing. I figured I might as well have given it a try lol.
409170,Spiel,2009-12-06 22:37:00,9065," Actually they do, well sometimes. I seen a few pike taken on roe bags and the biggest pike I ever hooked was through the ice on a roe bag.....go figure.  As to Splashopper's query, I have nothing."
409173,JohnF,2009-12-06 22:49:00,3494,Talk to yer friend Mod Chris. He finds pike in cold dreary water. Of course he needs me to aim his cast. Seems to me I suggested he use a light jig with a plastic minnow but you should ask him.  JF

409230,pike slayer,2009-12-07 01:03:00,1177,"or large cranks but work them slowly, let them take a good look at it"
409253,scuro2,2009-12-07 01:35:00,904,Larger jigs...not a lot of movement. Deep.

409372,Reelpro,2009-12-07 15:43:00,73,"Try blade baits. I have had great success for late fall Pike and Walleye using Large blade baits. Buy the biggest ones you can find. 11/2 oz.  I tip the rear hook with a small piece of minnow or worm, or power bait. It takes a little experimenting to get them tipped and still have the vibration on the bait.  Rip the baits aggressively with either long casts, let it sink to bottom then pull the bait in big rod sweeps - 5 to 6 feet at a time. Or vertically in deeper holes jigging it up 4 to 5 feet at a time aggressively, then let it hang still for a spell.  Walleye and Pike will smash these things in really cold water when they seem to just be nibbling or tapping at a slow or still jig/minnow. Great bait through the ice too.  Its been probably the most successful rod in the boat pst few seasons in cold fall waters.  GL MIKE "
