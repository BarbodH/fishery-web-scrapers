409910,irishfield,2009-12-08 23:25:00,26272,Didn't miss much lads... other than a BEAUTIFUL day on the water!! We didn't get much of that sun they promised. Boat's covered in ice head to toe.. thanks to the spray from 5 footers when coming back in. No issues launching or retrieving thanks to the ramp prep yesterday.  Sad.. but I think we may be done for the year. Some ice in the back bays... surface was 36 at the ramp... 42 out on the lake.
