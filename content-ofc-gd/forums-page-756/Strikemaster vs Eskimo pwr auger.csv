409448,Muskieman,2009-12-07 20:51:00,2472,If the only choices I had were between.. Strikemaster or Eskimo....   I'd get the Eskimo.  A ton of my friends have Eskimos and love them.  I had the chance to try a Strikemaster last winter and @ - 25 it didn't wanna start.  But.... My first choice is a Jiffy.   RFS 
409450,MooseMerch,2009-12-07 21:05:00,68,I'll second that jiffy
409492,rhare,2009-12-07 23:26:00,387,"Strikemaster is way better then the Eskimo, but I wish I never sold my jiffy!!"
409544,Sinker,2009-12-08 01:22:00,8692,"  Agreed!!!  Actually, I wish I sold my Jiffy.........mine kinda got ""donated"" to the old man.............along with my portable hut!!! Its too bad he's 3000km from me  S."
409547,buckster,2009-12-08 01:26:00,530,Jiffy all the way!  Two of my friends have strikemasters and i have my holes cut before they even get thiers started!
