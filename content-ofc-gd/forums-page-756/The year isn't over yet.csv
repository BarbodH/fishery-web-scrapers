409239,bigugli,2009-12-07 01:14:00,6138,"  All these year end reports and evaluations when there's still fishing to be done.  May not be able to go far or stay out for long, but it's still fishing. Last week the son, Rob D, caught his PS pike while I was catching dink perch.  Was out again, today despite the raw wind to play with pannies.  Had the good fortune of running into a long lost OFNer, JWL. Glad to see he's been doing OK.  There's still 3 1/2 weeks good fishing out there. ( As long as Mamma and the chauffuer let me)"
