We have been getting quite a few spam accounts. It used to be software programs doing the spam registration and we had ways to prevent it... but now it is actual people doing it and there is no other way to get a handle on it. Approval may take up to 24 hours after new members have confirmed their email address through the validation email. Sorry for the inconvenience

As anyone who goes back far enough to remember the usenet , newsreaders and moderated groups like rec.hunting because of the antis where every post had to be approved before it would show up will attest. We got it good here, hats off to the mods"
