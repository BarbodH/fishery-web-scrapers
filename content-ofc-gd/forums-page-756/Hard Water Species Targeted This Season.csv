409461,Moosebunk,2009-12-07 21:55:00,3970,"24/7 - when did I make such a promise???  If I could get ya on a big toothy I would... truth is though, you're probably better at it than I am.  Jacques - maybe I'll head PQ side for some whities at some point.  Dunno???  Lots of new places I'm curious about for my first ever ice season in the south.  And yep... I do have it in mind to camp and fish Kesagami this year, but I'll have to wait and see."
409472,Leecher,2009-12-07 22:53:00,7832," Cool Drew!!!  If ya ever make it over in our neck of the woods, let me know We got some of the best fishing lakes the Valley has to offer Jacques"
409476,Anderson,2009-12-07 23:06:00,32,Up here in Nipigon We usually go for walleys  pike and specks with the first ice Then around Jan we go after whities  lakers and lake herring March brings in the Bows The only problem around here is deciding what to go for( What a cunundrum   ) Chuck
409491,Leecher,2009-12-07 23:26:00,7832," Thanks Chuck!!!  You're so lucky to be able to target trout.... Up here, season closed late September and only opens in mid April  You certainly have a good choice of species to target Tight lines Leechman"
409493,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-12-07 23:27:00,1362,  Hey Jacques....I think Bunk lives in the Ottawa Valley now.....are you talkin' bout a Quebec valley in your neck of the woods that I don't know about????
409495,Leecher,2009-12-07 23:34:00,7832, No Steve..... I was referring to the Outaouais Valley
409497,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-12-07 23:39:00,1362,"  Ok...the Hull valley....  I know it from my teenage years.....VIVA, Le Soleil....."

Almost have the new ice fishing sled tuned up just waiting for my clutch parts that are on back order to come in   Maybe i should just drop the $400 and get a whole new clutch fromthe states.  "
406581,walleye_man,2009-11-29 12:18:00,135,for me its all pike and walleye iv never tryed for crappies maby fon the list this upcoming year cant wait

406920,Leecher,2009-11-30 03:35:00,7832,"Here's the tally so far:  Out of 46 votes, it's a 3 way split for first with 17.82% Walleye, Perch and Whities  Second followed by Lakers @ 14.85%  Then third Crappie @ 10.89%  Followed by Pike @ 9.90% - Specks 3.96% - Carp 2.97%  and last but not least Sturgeon and Chrome @ 1.98%  It's getting interesting..... keep voting guys!!!

407219,Leecher,2009-12-01 03:17:00,7832,"Ohhh I guess my last tally is just a little off eh  After 56 votes on multiple choices, sounds like walleye is the preferred species.... followed by perch, whities, lakers, pike and crappie....  Thanks for voting folks..... now bring on the hard stuff Tight lines Leechman"
407238,richyb,2009-12-01 03:57:00,774,"untill simcoe is froze up for lakers and whities ill be on the smaller lakes for perch, pike and crappie. Then once simcoe is closed its back to the small lakes."
407277,Spiel,2009-12-01 12:41:00,9065,If it has an adipose fin it got my vote. Truth is though I'm not likely going to be augering any holes this winter.
407572,Leecher,2009-12-02 02:03:00,7832, Thanks richyb!!!  Good luck!!! Thanks Chris!!!  You could always get someone to punch some for ya!!!

407593,Leecher,2009-12-02 03:06:00,7832, Merci Randy!!!  I use to get into mudpuppies beginning of March on the Ottawa River....  But now only fish local lakes and never caught another  Bonne chance cette saison et tight lines Jacques
407953,Leecher,2009-12-03 01:53:00,7832,"Another tally cause I'm way off again After 71 votes on multiple choices Walleyes are the preferred species followed by Perch, Lakers and whitties  Keep voting folks!!! Leechman"
408018,MCTFisher9120,2009-12-03 04:05:00,3761,Being a new comer to ice fishing this season I'm hoping to catch some walleye possibly keep a few but mainly C&R for me.  Should be fun to learn how to catch these fish. Good luck and keep safe everyone.  MTBF
408026,Leecher,2009-12-03 04:31:00,7832," Good luck to you Mike with them eyes!!!   Got to remember, eyes are little finicky at times.... they go for the smallest minnows you can present to them and you can find them on weedy flats early morning and on drop offs  Have fun this upcoming season!!! Jacques"
408029,Roy,2009-12-03 04:49:00,13728,"Great poll, Jacques. With walleye in the lead, I'm pretty sure  you'd get the same result in the summer for that species. I'm curious about the boys targeting sturgeon on the ice though. A lot of zones in Ontario are closed all year for sturgeon. The ones that are open are zero limit on catch and/or possession. Why would they be targeted? Hmmm, just wondering...."
408143,Governator,2009-12-03 17:37:00,879,I accidently checked bass I think...  oops.
408179,Leecher,2009-12-03 19:55:00,7832, Thanks Roy!!!  You've raised a good point about the sturgeon.... I was checking the OMNR regs and those zones that are open it's S-0 and C-0 I think CPR is the only reason I can come up with...   No problems Gov.... bass is open til March 31st 2010 in Qu√©bec
409220,skeeter,2009-12-07 00:47:00,1907,there is no box for me to check my catagorie isnt there   anything that will bite the dam hook!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
409244,Leecher,2009-12-07 01:18:00,7832, I hear ya skeeter.... ran out of poll options
409315,Moosebunk,2009-12-07 10:39:00,3970,I'll be after trout mostly... I hope.  Maybe pannies.  Hope to take a trip for pike as well.
406449,Leecher,2009-11-29 00:17:00,7832,"Hey guys, lets have some fun before the hard water stuff gets here.... It's always interesting to see what others are planning to target in the up coming season..... I know that for some of you, there won't be any hard water fishing but please make a selection..... that includes our friends from the south.  I think I've covered pretty well all the fresh water species in the poll  I for myself will be targeting mainly walleye this year.... I have the 6"" auger ready and tipups and jigging rod. Lets see your selection for the fun of it... Lets have some fun!!! Leechman"
406451,Whitespinnerbait,2009-11-29 00:24:00,2038,Whities big time...  Walleye on the way up to the Whities....

406457,Whitespinnerbait,2009-11-29 00:33:00,2038,  One vote for Whities  One for vote for Wal-ice
406460,Leecher,2009-11-29 00:38:00,7832, Cool Paul.... I like your thinking
406479,hendrix,2009-11-29 01:31:00,61,"whities for sure, hopefully walleye and lakers crappie is always good too"
406483,Dondorfish,2009-11-29 01:38:00,1000,I'll be targeting Lakers and Whities - but what I'll catch is perch!   Tracker
406486,johnnyb,2009-11-29 01:43:00,3413,I have to pick just ONE?  sigh...okay...but I notice that Ling are missing from the list...you never know....
406494,DRIFTER_016,2009-11-29 02:02:00,10439,"Lakers are number one for me. Then it's Whities, walleyes and Pike."
406505,Fishing 24/7,2009-11-29 02:54:00,709,Pike and whities!
406522,BassAsin,2009-11-29 03:36:00,806,normally i couldnt pick just one but after the wallies i caught on my little lake last year i had to chalk one up for the eyes!
406523,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-29 03:37:00,0,"All Salvelinus, all the time."
406527,The Urban Fisherman,2009-11-29 03:46:00,2050,I voted crappie because it was the closest think you had to bluegill on the list jacques!  I'd also like to try my hand at catching a carp through the ice... tried last year with zero success but I'm going to give it another go this year...
406530,Harrison,2009-11-29 03:52:00,2202,Crappie Kawarthas Walleye Quinte Perch No better place then Simcoe
406532,limeyangler,2009-11-29 04:00:00,5204,Scoot down to Upper Manitou in the early hours and catch my limit of Lakers......head down the logging road again and hit Dore Lake for whities in the afternoon and be there for some walleye action on the evning bite same lake ......lets hope the skidoomobilethingy dont break down too often.
406535,Leecher,2009-11-29 04:08:00,7832, Thanks hendrix!!!  Whities is one of the toughest species to catch and sure is the most exciting to hook on   Thanks Tracker!!!  Perch is always fun to catch too.... good luck with the lakers and whites   Thanks Johnny!!!  I can't add any more choices to the poll cause I reached the limit..... but ling is another species that I've never caught on ice   Thanks Drifter!!!  I was hoping you post a hard water report for us.... I know you have good ice up there right now   Thanks Kev!!!  But what about Bass????   Thanks Matt!!!  I'm sure it's just a matter of time before you go out on hard water.   Thanks Dr!!!   Thanks Ryan!!!  Yes bluegill is another fine species to target on ice but I reach the limit of choices on the poll   Thanks Harrison!!!
406537,Slop,2009-11-29 04:12:00,151,"Daytime Crappies deep and night time Crappies shallow.  Whities and Bass in Quebec......how fun is that, Leechman?"

406539,Leecher,2009-11-29 04:14:00,7832, Thanks Slop!!!  Whities and bass..... loads of fun my friend
406541,limeyangler,2009-11-29 04:22:00,5204,"  I think its finally started...after many..many false starts.  were at zero temps during the days now too so it wont be long.....i might hit up that lake i asked your advice about last year re: catching bass thru the ice...say i'm gonna try every year and never do, but its one of those small lakes that ices over quick.   Anyhoo....great post Jacques...keep up the good work."
406543,Leecher,2009-11-29 04:31:00,7832," Ohhh now you got me excited     It just a matter of time before we see a Simon style hard water report If you can go..... good luck Simon Remember ""Canadian Wobbler in bronze"""
406553,DRIFTER_016,2009-11-29 05:29:00,10439,"  Plenty of ice up here, I have just been too busy to go. I would go tomorrow, but it is going to be too nice so I have work to do on my sled trailer. Better to do it now when the temps are -3 to -5 than when it's -20!!!"
406556,Leecher,2009-11-29 05:48:00,7832," I hear ya on the temps..... I can just imagine in January and February, must be brutal up your way It's always better to fix what needs fixing now than later.  But please post a report when you do go out Tight lines Jacques"
