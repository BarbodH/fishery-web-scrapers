409727,Kinger,2009-12-08 14:36:00,351,We live between three of the great lakes and still havent been really hit too hard.  I want a big blizzard.
409735,solopaddler,2009-12-08 14:46:00,8605,I'm in a quandary. Can't decide whether to throw my gear in the truck enroute to work today. Normally I leave straight from the office Wed mornings to go fishing...
409754,Harrison,2009-12-08 15:16:00,2202," Geeze Roy..  I see why J does it, can be tough to see over the snow piles for some folks"

409759,anders,2009-12-08 15:36:00,1168," No....im sure the small lakes do, but that is all kiboshed know...last year on opening weekend there was an inch of ice...the rest was snow and slush...not looking good to start this year again."
409763,troutologist,2009-12-08 16:02:00,951,"  One good thing about the move is we alrady have safe (ish) ice. Was out on the weekend after stocked trout, nothing.  But -33 windchill this morning is tightening things up. Barely enough snow to cover the ground though."
