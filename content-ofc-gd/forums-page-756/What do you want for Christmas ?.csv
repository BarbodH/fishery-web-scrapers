409352,BITEME,2009-12-07 14:50:00,1968, Not hard to find call salus in Waterloo and they will tell you who is selling them you will not be dissapointed
409353,Curtis,2009-12-07 14:57:00,83,I would like a new flasher one of the hummingbirds and a couple new ice fishing rod and reels  Oh and Some ice to fish on would be excellent...

I used to be able to get it at LeBarons in Ottawa but Berkely has taken over----When I went to buy some there last time the Dept Mgr gave me the word on not carrying it any more---he also mentioned how he bought a bunch of it as they were clearing it out  Some wide gap Northland Shiner jigs would be cool too.

409358,GBW,2009-12-07 15:17:00,8460,an under water camera is on my list.  or a flasher would be nice...

409475,Jer,2009-12-07 23:05:00,1426,"  My favourite mono as well. It's almost impossible to find anywhere. I know of one small tackle store that still has some, but at $13.99 a spool, it's pricey. Lebarons used to sell it for just over $7. I've got a couple spools of 6 & 8 lb left.  Is it even made anymore?"
409709,GBW,2009-12-08 14:01:00,8460,Looks like BPS still sells it.  I have a spool of it in 20lb as my backing on my baitcasters.
409711,Jer,2009-12-08 14:06:00,1426,"I've looked before at BPS, so it must be recently that they have started to carry it. I'll have to remember to look next time I'm there."
409718,GBW,2009-12-08 14:21:00,8460,I got it there 2 years ago but the web site still has it listed...  call first?
409721,richyb,2009-12-08 14:29:00,774,I would like ice cleats for my boots for those glare ice days on the lake. Nothing is better than taking off in a sprint to get to a tripped pike line and do a complete header with a sore groin .
