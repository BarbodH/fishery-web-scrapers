408607,vinnimon,2009-12-05 00:31:00,2593,"Does anyone know if I can plug my sony camcorder and record from an aqua view.Having a hard time finding a cable to mate the two.Sayal electronics in burlington should have it,but they were of no help.Does aqua wiew have cables to adapt to different brands of cam corders?  I would like to film using my aquaview if possible.Thanks.V"
408609,Terry,2009-12-05 00:33:00,14456,any aquvu that I have seen had an RCA output for video out nothing else
408613,GBW,2009-12-05 00:35:00,8460,"did you check ""cables to go"" or ""Startech"" by chance?"
408615,vinnimon,2009-12-05 00:41:00,2593,"No I havent,sayal probably has the cord.The staff are not all knowing.I even brought the 2 devices in to show them what I need.I will try both of what you suggested tommorrow.Thanks alot"

408652,Fisherman,2009-12-05 03:11:00,7201,"Curiosity got me, went and checked my Scout manual, it says, use a patch cord with RCA plugs at each end, one goes into your Sony camcorder ""in"" jack, the other end into the Aqua Vu video ""out"".  These patch cords are the same as you use to hook up any type of the older Stereo/TV components, cost next to nothing.  Like these: http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.js...oductId=2103856"

408810,Uncle Buck,2009-12-05 21:57:00,1000,no the aquaview plug is a proprietary plug...  you're stuck buying their recorder...  good news is its on sale at the cabelas.com site for $60  no go and order it!!
408812,vinnimon,2009-12-05 22:20:00,2593,"Thanks ill check it out,Im sure bills bait and tackle can order it for me.cheers and thanks."
408823,Fisherman,2009-12-05 22:59:00,7201," Well I'm calling Bull on this one, unless you want me to go take a picture of my Scout with the RCA plugs engaged, they fit just fine."
408832,vinnimon,2009-12-05 23:31:00,2593,
408839,Terry,2009-12-05 23:53:00,14456,as I said in the beginning RCA Jack  
408849,vinnimon,2009-12-06 00:16:00,2593,
408996,tjsa,2009-12-06 14:49:00,1578,Can you take a picture of the input at the camera end?
409006,Terry,2009-12-06 15:13:00,14456,you would need a proprietary plug. or simply cut off their ends and make your own
409052,Fisherman,2009-12-06 17:42:00,7201," Okay did a check with the Aqua Vu, mine has two RCA plugs on the back, Vid in, vid out, like Terrys,  but it looks like Sony has gone to using a 3.5mm(1/8th"") stereo male plug(just like the small stereo headphones) for their A/V input or an S Video plug.  That is the hole onn the side of the Sony cam with the yellow ring.  Rotten scoundrels.   But like Terry said you can make your own."

409082,irishfield,2009-12-06 19:04:00,26272, Sounds just like the cord for my Canon Camera. Stereo plug out of camera.. split to sound and video RCA's on the other. Bet it would work.. 
409087,vinnimon,2009-12-06 19:16:00,2593,"so all in all,to go from an aqua view to a sony camcorder is possible,no need to by an aqua view recorder,correct."
