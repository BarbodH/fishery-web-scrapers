410068,singingdog,2009-12-09 11:13:00,1047,"Yep, there is some DNA confirmation of cougar presence in Ontario. That same DNA evidence confirmed that it was an escapee (it was genetically related to Latin american populations). There seem to be a few around, but no proof whatsoever that they are wild animals instead of escapees.  Here is an interesting excerpt from the Easter Cougar foundation. The bolding at the end is mine.  ""Sightings are the great conundrum in eastern cougar research. As reliable as sightings may appear to be, our experience – and the experience of wildlife agencies – is that the vast majority of cougar reports are misidentifications of other animals. Although the ECF has fielded hundreds of first-hand accounts and evaluated countless pieces of evidence, and while there remains always the possibility of a released or escaped cougar turning up, our sighting hotline has never produced a confirmation. The evidence we receive as photographs and videos, by and large, are of the cougar’s smaller wild cousin, the bobcat, housecats, and less often, dogs and deer. Large tracks consistently turn out to be coyote, dog, or black bear.  As much as we’d love to believe cougar sightings – and many of us at the ECF first joined the search inspired by so many reports – we can only conclude that there is a profound misapprehension inherent in these reports. Where cougars are well established, any knowledgeable individual can find evidence in a few days. Yet, our own field searches, sometimes within hours or a day of a sighting, have failed to produce evidence, and years pass between confirmations."""
410079,Whitespinnerbait,2009-12-09 12:06:00,2038,Remember...  Their have also been many sightings of a  Lochness Monster  Abominable Snowman  Sasquatch .........   
410084,Anderson,2009-12-09 12:20:00,32,"There have been many sightings up here in the ThunderBay District My wife seen one cross the road in Thunder Bayalso a friend of mine seen one in his field stalking a bunch of grouse that were strutting their spring plumage acouple of years back and numerous other sightings We have the habitat that they prefer, high rocky ranges that rarely see people and an over population of deer Sometime when i""m out prospecting around areas like this I get that  feeling that something is watching Hmmmm Myself.....never seen one. I did see a timber wolf though and I couldn't believe how big it was friggin huge Sorta happy their are lots of deer here Maybe their are UFO""s Sandsquanches and Nessies  Hmmmm Chuck"
410088,dave524,2009-12-09 12:36:00,4508,"Curiously almost all sightings seem to occur during the warmer months when visibility is obscured by foliage and tracking a soft padded animal is difficult. You would think that like other animals, sightings and tracks would spike during the winter months with better visibility and snow to hold tracks. If there is a sighting in winter I can't see why its tracks have not be followed and the animal confirmed, cats are not a long winded animal that could outdistance a determined tracker or hounds."
410124,troutologist,2009-12-09 15:11:00,951,  I'm still 99.9% sure me and the wing observed one heading up icefishing a couple winters ago. It was up around that moose kill we were always seeing the wolves at a couple curves before the parking spot for that one lake.  Nothing else could have a blunted head and long thin tail like that. Also it covered ground like no animal I have ever seen. From 1 side of the road to the other and over the big banks...2 jumps.

410153,Brettiop,2009-12-09 16:25:00,279,"Always a sighting or two in and around the native reserve near Bothwell ontario, along with pictures of tracks in the local newspaper.  My parents sat in there house and watched a large cat walk across the laneway from the forest to the field one day, two days later while fishing i was startled as another large cat jumped out of some bushes while on my way down to the river. We assume it was the same one both similar descriptions....but it wasn't in as large as a cougar....but way to large to be a house cat of any kind. in the 60+ lbs range 3 feet high and 4 feet long. I did not continue to fish that day lol.  Also had a wolf stare me down while fishing just three weeks ago...he was curious but ran off after a few minutes, must have thought my rod was a gun."
410167,Fishnwire,2009-12-09 16:55:00,983,"I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if they are around.  As far as scientific proof goes, I remember seeing a story about a biologist who was studying native badgers.  He had been doing so for over seven years and said that in that time spent actually looking for badgers, he saw three.  I know they are entirely different species, but I would think a big cat would be as good as anything else in the bush at keeping itself hid.  I don't know about effecting the deer population.  Wolves and coyotes would almost certainly kill more, and a friend I know who retired from the CN says engineers generally believe more moose are killed by trains each year than all other causes, natural and otherwise, put together.  I imagine the numbers are somewhat simular with deer.  The main reason that makes me think that there are very few if any out there though is because if they were around in any numbers, some yahoo would have shot one by now and bragged to the whole world about it."
410177,Anderson,2009-12-09 17:10:00,32,"A few years back some yahoo shot a white moose not far from Nipigon      I don""t think he lives here anymore   Chuck"
410183,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-09 17:15:00,0, many sightings on ranger lake road.  thiffault saw one about ten years back.  he's a well trained resources technician and trust his sighting as well as yours.
409789,Curtis,2009-12-08 17:20:00,83,"I'm not sure if this topic has been on the board yet or not beacuse i have just recenty got the internet again. The ""where are the deer"" post got me thinking, im pretty sure their is one in my area my uncle shot at it a few years ago & neighbours have reported sittings. Its just a thought but could that be a reason for deer decline in some area's? I dont even wanna know how many deer a cougar would kill per yr..  Anyways what are your thoughts on cougar sittings?"
409795,Terry,2009-12-08 17:22:00,14456,yes there are cougars...no secret that I know of  http://www.ontariopuma.ca/
409807,Cookslav,2009-12-08 17:38:00,1457,"There are cougars in Ontario, there is no doubt, the only thing up for debate is if they are naturally reproducing. I have not heard if the MNR has released an official stance on this yet?  Personaly I'd say they are, based on the volume of confirmed sights. If they are not there were ALOT of pet cougars that escaped their pens.  Now... Insert the jokes cause we know they are comming"

409891,DRIFTER_016,2009-12-08 22:41:00,10439,"Yep, they're about. Back early in the decade when I was living in Grand Valley we had one down by our pond that was feeding on the gut pile from the deer we cleaned back there."
409893,Dano,2009-12-08 22:53:00,719,"I believe. A good friend of mine who lives in Southgate (N/W of Shelburne) was over at a neighbours and the MNR was there investigating the killing of two horses on his property. My buddy told them that a really big dog had been leaving prints around his pond. The biologist went over to his pond and confirmed that they were indeed cougar tracks. He made me promise not to tell his wife, lol. He also has a pic of a bear in a cornfield next to his house."
409895,Burtess,2009-12-08 23:01:00,901,"I would think they are around, but more so in the remote areas, you would think there would be way more sightings if they were around higher populated areas. That being said a couple of years ago while walking in the Dundas Conservation Area with my kids, we found the rear leg and part of the hind quarter of a deer about 15 feet up in a tree.   Wonder how that got there????  Burt"
409897,craigdritchie,2009-12-08 23:02:00,1586,"While most seem to agree cougars are likely found in Ontario, no one - MNR included - seems to be able to confirm it. If the big cats are here, they are extremely few and very far between. That being the case, no one should be shooting at the damn things.  Deer decline? Where? Whitetails are almost out of control in Ontario."
409900,cram,2009-12-08 23:07:00,1733,"I have never seen one but would bet $ that they exist here.  Way too many sightings and signs of them.  I doubt they have a measurable impact on the deer population though.  Too few of them (by nature) and there are lots of deer anyway.  Coyotes and wolves may be cutting into that, but still...."
409901,Richard S.,2009-12-08 23:07:00,75,"That would make sense since the Puma's main diet is deer. This is there native range, and according to the Ontario Puma foundation there are about 550 province wide and their numbers are steadily increasing as well.   Rich."
409917,Dara,2009-12-08 23:39:00,3052,I had one run across the road in front of me up here 2 years ago out by my cabin. No doubt about what it was.

409942,danc,2009-12-09 00:29:00,4677,I was fortunate enough to see one many years ago while Grouse hunting. No doubt about what it was. A huge tawny colored cat that appeared on the trail about 30 yards in front of me.
409946,richyb,2009-12-09 00:38:00,774,A few years ago we were told by some loggers that they seen one by our vehicles while we were fishing at a camp by sudbury. My grandfather seen one last summer just outside of kirkfield. My brother also seen one in the same area in the spring. There was tracks in orillia last year that were confirmed by a puma specialist.
409970,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-09 01:38:00,0,i've yet to have the privelege but several friends have had sightings...  there's only one animal with a tail like that...

409994,T Fisher,2009-12-09 02:49:00,139,"I saw what looked like a huge cat with a long tail in my head lights. We were coming home from a moose hunt in October 2007.  We were about 200k south of Cocrane Ont.  It was that time of day when all the animals big and small are moving, the break of dawn around 6:00am. I was driving with my co pilot sitting in the passanger seat we both turned to each other yelling Cougar ?. It crossed in front of my truck aprox 30 meters. What a site."
409999,Skud,2009-12-09 02:54:00,739,There has been many sightings of one in Innisfil. The 6th line and Huronia rd. area(confirmed 'off the record' by MNR).  There is also been reports of a 'family' of cougars in the area of Hwy 9 between Hwy 400 and #27 down in the swamps. I believe!
410032,bigfish1965,2009-12-09 04:21:00,3382,"There are CONFIRMED pumas in Niagara...(confirmed by MNR via scat samples in a cave adjacent to a quarry) as well as a black panther who has not been seen in awhile in the Fort Erie area. There is another believed to live in the Port Colborne area ( attacked a horse on a trail). Another puma attacked a horse in Fonthill and was seen leaving a barn with a smaller cat in tow that may have been a young puma. A tracker was hired to kill the puma in Fonthill since it was in a farm next to a school but she got wise and moved on. The MNR does not believe these are Eastern Cougars, but escaped pets and are not protected by the Endangered Species Act or Species at Risk. Interestingly the law that does protect cougars lists the incorrect scientific name for the cat leaving the law kinda useless anyway."
410046,ch312,2009-12-09 05:03:00,1590,"while quading this summer two of us watched an adult cougar jump across the trail about 20-40 yards ahead while we were going 60km/h. we both stopped right away and both knew exactly what it was. my buddy in front saw the entire body and i saw the rear half. definitely a cats paws and long tail. no question about what we saw. i have been hunting since i was a kid (over 15 years?) and can track deer through some nasty stuff. but, this cat left no sign at all and we looked around for a while to get a pic of tracks.  this was located about 5-7 minutes WSW of the brantford city limits. it was roughly 20-30 yards from the fences of houses near the ""windmill store"" in mount pleasant for those who know the brantford area.   a few years ago my father and i saw a very fresh large cougar track in mud. there is simply no canine that could leave such a track which was basically like a giant house cat track with rounder toes."
