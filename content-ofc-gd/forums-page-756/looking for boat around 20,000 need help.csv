Since you asked for an answer in your statement I need to bring up a post from the past.here is the quote  OFC HAS REALLY GONE DOWNHILL  I would like to know what happened to the OFC board. This used to be a great board with lots of info. Now all it is is a place to run people down when they ask a question. Comeon people come on this board wanting to get some info and that is what it was made for. Now everone is afraid to make a post asking a question without getting run down. I will no longer be visting for a while because this has got to be too much. I post a question about my car even and get run down what the hell is with that. This board needs a serious ""clean up"" and untill then i will be sticking to ************ ( named another fishing board edited by head mod/ owner TJ.)  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH  unquote   This above thread that you started in anger because of the car thread previously was a slap in the face of all of the OFNCer's that have tried to answer or show you in humor that we can't diagnose your cars ailments from the description that you had posted. The above thread points out that you do not want to put in the time to help correct OFC but rather you want  the mod's to clean up as you state the people who you feel  ran you down. You then leave in disgust but not before advertising the name of another forum.  So here is how Roy ""benefited"" form his post:  He took the time to read your past posts and see that you used OFC in the past with threads that were expending resources from members that did not know how ungrateful you were in the recent past. All of the Mod's as their first duty are charged with keeping this board profitable or it will not pay it's bills and not exist. The second thing they are charged with is keeping the people that make up this board comfortable it means to remove people that aggravate, flame or appear to be trolling. Since your previous 4 threads were 3 for information and 1 to bash OFC  he felt instead of deleting your post he would call you on your past in an attempt to see what your intentions were. I think he was hoping that you would do what I suggested after the fact but you chose the same path as you did before and that was to bash the MOD's in CAPITOLS.  If you want your future here to be one of fun and helpfullness then take the time to contribute were you can and if your thread goes South on you then have the ability to analyze why and not lash out in anger.  The question after you read this most likely is why did Art take the time and effort to write this: The answer is I enjoy OFC and think that you have the ability to become a contributing member and adding value to this site.

409583,bigfish1965,2009-12-08 02:25:00,3382,"Honestly... I would wait till spring. I have a feeling gas prices will head back up and the bigger boats will be discounted like they were this past spring. You don't NEED a boat now...you WANT a boat now. Wait awhile and you will get the perfect boat. Now that being said..if I had the cash I would have bought that Lund in a heartbeat. I would have begged and bribed my way into that ride. It was the best deal on a boat we have had here in recent memory...easily worth 12,000 and going for 7,000. I would drive a bit to save 5,000 and put up with hassles and paperwork. I may have even begged the owner to drive it over here and hand him the cash plus a little extra for delivery and then deal with the paperwork hassles later. TonyB was selling his Lund that he won for around 20K..don't know if he still has it or not."
409613,craigdritchie,2009-12-08 03:09:00,1586,"Beyond that Rick, our dollar is still hovering around 96 cents in spite of the Bank of Canada holding the line on interest rates (new rate announcement is coming tomorrow - just watch, the rates won't budge).  Once people get their January credit card bills, the US dollar will dip and the Loonie will hit par again, probably by mid-February, right in time for the spring fishing show.  That would be the time to watch for deals, especially on used boats. Things are pretty quiet for boat dealers between then and May, so many will be inclined to deal."
409617,irishfield,2009-12-08 03:14:00,26272,Yep.. lots of stuff out there... like a 2009 2025 Lund Pro V.. 250 Verado.. 9.9 Pro kicker.. dual Lowrances.. 110lb bow mount.. dual axle trailer.. $35K US and even stating OBO !!!
409629,Roy,2009-12-08 03:39:00,13728,"Yup,  early February, don't buy a boat, buy US greenbacks and keep them for a year or so. Maybe less."

407934,bigredfisher,2009-12-03 01:00:00,300,"hey i have been on a very long search for a boat that would suit me for what i need it for. I am looking for a boat that would be stable in kinda rough water but not Huge max 20 ft. I want to find some sort of package deal with like 2 riggers, gps, fishfinder, and kicker. I am looking for some sort of newer boat. I am almost about to give up. I thought that it would be easy. I want to run this boat on the niagra in like dec and handle quinte and ontario with ease. Do you know of anyone who is selling something around my price range or close to it. Or do you have anything for sale. Please help.... thanks darryl  ps: send pics details and price to [email protected].  thanks darryl"

407990,Radnine,2009-12-03 02:42:00,1538,"   Holy cow dude! could you put up any more road blocks? Unless this thing leaks like a sieve, it's worth twice the drive your looking at. When I was first boat looking I would have killed for an opportunity like this Lund. Fortunately there were none and I bought a brand new Crestliner!!! How fortuitous. If you've got twenty grand in your pocket, then hold out for new if you like (Hell, they are already advertising the boat show in January) but this Lund looks like a deal to me. Jim"
408017,HTHM,2009-12-03 04:04:00,4082,For 5 grand more you could buy Fishmasters rig. He is getting a newer boat and selling his old one.

408086,Harrison,2009-12-03 13:58:00,2202,"That's a pretty good deal for the Lund.  Too far???  2 and a half hours and you'd have the boat on your hitch heading home.  Commonly drive from Bowmanville to Queenston, fish for a few hours and home for dinner."

408614,dave524,2009-12-05 00:38:00,4508,"For an offshore Great Lakes boat, I would second the recomendation for the Starcraft Fishmaster, they are a much deeper hull than the Lunds, fine multi species boat that they are and of very good quality. The Starcraft with a greater floor to gunwale height just makes me feel more secure setting riggers and netting fish in rough water, might not be quite as easy to reach down and lip a bass though. I run a mid 80's vintage Sylvan 18 foot centre console that has 29"" of floor to gunwale height, that 196 Fishmaster would have more than that judging by how far the motor is notched down below the gunwale height at the back. Fished out of several comparable Lunds and always felt nervous like if I slipped and lost my balance the gunwale would hit me just above the knees and over I would go. Sorry, but I just like an offshore boat with sides up around my waist."
408619,brickNblock,2009-12-05 00:47:00,598,"Check out quintefishing.com... there is a real nice Lund Pro-V in their classified for sale. I have seen this boat and it is in immaculate condition. This Lund is a 2000 but Ive seen '07-'08's that dont look near as good....(no apparent dock rash or touch-ups) I believe it had a 4-Strk 90 Yammy w/9.9merc kicker with berts tracks and riggers...(+,+,+) Immaculate is the word and Im kicking myself, as we all do later down the road when we buy used....not like there is anything wrong with mine but this is a real nice looking boat and he was only asking $16,800. He's a Qunite regular so it will handle the waters you spoke of.. if your willing to fish Quinte as you said then you shouldnt mind driving there to take a peak if its at all still available... Take a quickee at the website...this boat is worth the lookNsee to be sure! best of luck."

I know you guys mean well and that's great but you're wasting your time trying to find bargains for him. I'm sorry but that's the way it is. Bigredfisher... if you disagree with me, take a gander at all of the threads you've started on here...start with the one on September 9th..... the guys are trying to help you...why don't you just come clean."

408759,bigredfisher,2009-12-05 16:56:00,300,he hasnt got the time to take the cover off. Im sure it will be fine inside
408856,linweir,2009-12-06 00:48:00,202,That is a very good multispecies boat (Princecraft Superpro 186). You should feel safe on big waters. Sure we can try it on Nigrara by end of year.
