409585,Daplumma,2009-12-08 02:25:00,1961,"I can remember as a youngster watching Gordie Howe and the production line back in the day that the goalie would ""rough up""the ice in front of the net.I played a lot of ""shinny"" hockey and pick up games before moving south and lost interest during the 70's and early 80's watching the worst hockey team ever...the Caps.Anyway..do the goalies still scratch up the ice?Why did they do it back then? Joe"
409591,BillM,2009-12-08 02:35:00,17367,"Increases friction, gives the goalie more traction when he's off his skates"
409598,jediangler,2009-12-08 02:52:00,1923,If they didn't they would slide right out of the net when going down for a save.
409611,Radnine,2009-12-08 03:07:00,1538,I always thought that they did that to smooth out any bumps that the puck could bounce over? Jim
409635,kickingfrog,2009-12-08 03:59:00,8333,Yes to all above.
409654,bigfish1965,2009-12-08 04:53:00,3382,"I don't know about the modern material pads, but the old leather pads were very slick on ice. If you did a pad-stack or slide, it was uncontrollable on slick ice. Scratching up some snow gave you friction and control."
409672,phiphntek,2009-12-08 11:22:00,115,it also redices glare
409680,Whopper,2009-12-08 11:56:00,2174,They are making ice for their water bottles they store on top of the net. Not going to tell you what's in there
409870,JohnF,2009-12-08 21:44:00,3494,Pretty much all of the above: - makes the ice less slippery for the floundering goalie - slows the puck down in the powder - eliminates little bumps that might cause the puck to jump over the stick  JF
409875,Dano,2009-12-08 21:56:00,719,"....and yes Joe, they still do it."
409889,Tybo,2009-12-08 22:38:00,1373,"To slow the puck. Nothing more embarrassing for a goalie then the trickle shot goal. Also to get rid of any bumps, so you  don't grab a edge."
409899,Radnine,2009-12-08 23:06:00,1538, The other day at my son's Novice game (7 & 8 yaer olds) the other goalie did it. It was cute as all get out. Our goalie didn't know which end of the stick to hang on to. Jim
410010,fishinguypat,2009-12-09 03:11:00,547,if they don't the puck would burn through the ice at incredible speeds and eventually breaking through the space time continuum... and they scratch the ice to stop this
410409,JohnF,2009-12-10 01:29:00,3494, I remember coaching (not sure that's the right word) 7 & 8 year olds just starting out. They'd all watched tv and each one as he got his turn as a goalie tried to emulate the big boys. They were lucky just to stand up let alone actually prep the ice. I have some great video of the kids playing on their first travel teams at age 9 & 10. They had slightly more composure but not much more skill.  Surprising how fast they grew up after that though. By the time he was 11 our eldest was the designated tough guy. The irony was he was about the least combative kid on the team but he loved the physical game. He could hang a totally illegal check on another player with a smile on his face and a sincere apology immediately after. But that's another story.  JF
