409886,fishhunter,2009-12-08 22:13:00,604,Just a fast note Guiding and Chartering are the same thing when done from a boat. If you plan on doing it there are new rules to follow. Transport Canada has set the guide lines up for taking people out for money. To do so you must have all the coarses.  Have your boat Registered Commercial and if your trailering your boat keep a log book of your road hours. Alot of people are running guiding buisness/charter that are not transport canada approved. Here in Port Hope we got the get it done or we pull you off the water and fine you large. They are hitting all ports and including the bay of quinte too. For people that want to run under the raydar thats up to them but i would not want to be the one that gets pulled over with clients onboard and look like a fool because they did not want to have the right boat for the amount of people or have the proper coarses that get you appoved. Its not a cheap thing to get this all done but i think its a great way to make sure when people book a charter they know they are getting on a safe boat and a trained captain. If your looking for the info on how to get legal Transport Canada website has it all listed. they have just added a 3 day coarse as of november more money to spend and they wonder why the guys are up and up charge what they do. Try starting a legal Guiding/ Charter buisness  and let me know what you spent before you even put the first dollar in your pocket.

409236,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-07 01:12:00,0,Knowing a few who do....it sure aint worth the the little amounts they make. Ask Koppers...... I know Aldo sure hasnt made a million....  that morning when you really don't want to go fishing for the 200th time this season with some guy who thinks he knows it all and has seen everything and you can't do better?!?!  ..........I'd rather stay home.......  .......
409318,Moosebunk,2009-12-07 11:15:00,3970,"I liked CC's sentiments and also Thorpe's.  This topic is great food for thought.  Mike... personally I'd think it not worth it for ya for river fishing... for pretty much the reasons CC states.  Thanks for taking me out... you know you'd be welcome to fish anytime, anywhere with me.  Same goes for DanC, Wayne and any others who have shared in the past.  When people would come visit me up north, or friends who didn't regularily fish joined me, taking them fishing was the ultimate for me.  There would only be certain types of fish I'd consider guiding for (some I'm not good enough at catching, some I am) and some places I'd only consider guiding.  I think for guiding to stay interesting and fun for the guide... it has to somehow always be just as much of an experience for both guide and guest, and the odds would be best if stacked in favor of success, but in a setting/experience that can almost always accept some failure to catch as well because of all else that is lived in the day and place.  ie, Drifter at Great Bear, Ramble at Kesagami or Ben in Seul.  These types of places hold great chances for intended species, don't hold fear of later being raped, and are a wilderness experience outside of fishing unto themselves.  If I don't have a regular job come next spring................."
409323,singingdog,2009-12-07 11:54:00,1047,"John, In your original post, I think you are comparing two different things- - maybe not apples and oranges, but at least oranges and grapefruit . Sharing your expertise by helping out other real-estate agents is  a very different thing than guiding: less pressure, more educated clientele, different circumstance.  As a fairly successful kayak fisherman, I have had numerous offers to guide. I am on the water almost 100 days/year and catch my share of large bass. I don't guide at this point for the simple reason that I don't want to have that kind of relationship with fishing....I don't want to ""need"" something from it. I fish for a variety of reasons, foremost amongst them is to get away from pressure and the need to produce. I love catching fish, and work very hard at it, but I don't want to give up the luxury of deciding when to work hard and when to kick back and enjoy the scenery. If I know that a frontal system is going to shut down the fish, I want to be able to stay off the water and get something else done, not have to meet somebody at lake X and thrash the water with spinnerbaits when I know the fishing won't be any good.  I love to teach and make a fair bit of my living as an artist doing just what you described: sharing my hard-earned knowledge with others that pursue one of my passions. I'm willing to do it with art because that is where I make my living and it is ""work"": I expect it to be a grind sometimes. I also train other folks that want to be teachers. Yes, it can be a joy, but it can also be a PIA when you are dealing with someone that believes that they shouldn't have to go through B,C,D and E to get from A to F and feel that by paying me to share knowledge with them, they are entitled to expect miracles.  At this point, I do not want fishing to ever become that."
409362,Jeff Wiles,2009-12-07 15:25:00,55,I have taking 20 or so guys over to N.Y. fishing and had a blast 2 guys at a time $100 US and I take them to all the popular spots. You are told on our first Email phone call what ever it is. I DO NOT PUT FISH ON YOUR HOOK. I will put you where the fish are and its up to you to catch them.  I think its fun I dont take them to some of my honey holes. Thats where I take my 8 year old.    Jeff
409376,solopaddler,2009-12-07 15:51:00,8605,  Are you a resident of NY?
409393,JohnF,2009-12-07 16:26:00,3494," This thread probably took on a tad more life than I'd expected but it's brought out some interesting points. All I'd really meant to ask was why more obviously accomplished fisherpersons, like you for instance, didn't try to find ways to let fishing help support itself. It can be an expensive habit, and just like drug users turn to dealing, for a while at least, it seems to me a no-brainer for those among us spending way too much on a habit to try to get something back. On the other side of the coin I know there are fisherperson wannabes like me who would happily pay something for the privilege of some river time and tutelage from the like of Mike (or you or Moosebunk or Garry or Lew or any of the many) who have attained icon or near-icon status through their sharing of knowledge and vicarious adventuring.  I fully understand the risks in turning a hobby into a job. On the other hand what could be better than a part time job that remains a hobby and more importantly helps offset the cost of the hobby?  I thought of another analogy that might better apply here. In Stratford we have a lot of folks who have gotten into the B&B business because of the Shakespearean theatre here. These are folks with big old houses and often nice retirement plans. In some cases they are folks who've come to town specifically to set up a B&B. For many it becomes a lifestyle thing. They meet a lot of new friends who come back year after year. These guests are happy to pay something for their accommodations because they start to feel like part of the family here, they get into a comfort zone and it works well for everyone. They'd be paying for a hotel if they didn't stay at the B&B.  Admittedly some of these B&B operators get tired of the pressure and the loss of privacy in their home but it's a relatively small percentage.  I liken a casual guiding venture to the B&B business. Not necessarily for everyone but a great thing for those who thrive on it.  Considering how much money some of the serious fisherfolks here invest in their fishing each year I sure don't blame some for taking advantage of an opportunity to offset those expenses, and considering the vicarious thrills we OFNers enjoy through their generosity I believe they have something just as worthy as a warm bed and pleasant company to offer to their guests. The tradeoff for the client is good company, confidence to try new things, exposure to knowledge and previously unacquired skill sets, and generally an escape from merely enjoying the grand adventures vicariously and jumping right into the stream and actually participating. Dayum! That sounds good.  Here's a scenario for you. My buddy Rob (another crazy artist) has been a kayak fishersoul for the better part of his life. His best moments are getting hisself lost in the Everglades in his kayak, communing with the snakes and alligators. He's been relentlessly hounding me to get a 'yak of my own so I can do some communing too. So assuming I were to get one of the infernal machines, why wouldn't I want to be shown around some of the best fishing in the province by someone who knows their way around kayaks and fishing both. I'd think it was great if I could confidently approach someone like you with a request for a day of kayak fishing for bass in the Kawarthas. How do I do it without feeling like I'm imposing? By knowing that I can offer to compensate you for your time and knowledge, so I make the request fully prepared to pay a few hundred bux. It makes it a win/win deal. I get some great guiding and tutelage and you come away with a bit of money to buy more flyline, or 'yak paddles, or bits of deerhair and owl scrotum or whatever esoteric pieces of the animal carcass you guys use in yer arcane little fly tying obsession. In the process you get to make new friends, just like the B&B operators. And just like the B&B operators you get to pick and choose your clients and where you will take them.  Of course, for those who absolutely do not want anything to do with selling themselves for a silver-crossed palm, there's the unquestioned right to never go commercial. For those who do there always remains the right to quit at any time it's no longer fun.  And now I'd better stop this push for commercializing fishing. I hadn't ever meant for it to be a campaign to turn everyone who has over achieved in fishing into a fish hooker, so to speak.  JF"

409429,torco,2009-12-07 18:51:00,656,"A lot of good points have been raised, especially with the rivers. I guess one thing I could add from customer perspective as I have used guides in the past as its a great way to try some fishing you will not normally do or don't have the means to do regularly.  I took advantage of a guide for Lake O salmon and trout, down in Belize to fish the reef, up on Lake Nipissing for walleye and bass, musky fishing in the kawartha's and I took some fly fishing guided lessons on the grand river. These were all treats for me, I would think most customer's come at from this angle. You want to learn and have abit of an adventure while you do it. I love fishing and it doesn't really matter what for.  I guess it gets tricky especially with rivers and creeks so easily exposed in southern ontario. It would be really easy to go back to a limited number of spots on a creek east of toronto after being shown it and that would be discouraging.  Anyways it has its place on certain bodies of water and hopefully people will continue to do and make a living on it because I know I will probably use it. Would love to go for rainbows on Niagara or whereever the heck solopaddler goes once in my life."
409483,rhare,2009-12-07 23:15:00,387,"This is an interesting topic and some great points have been made.  One thing people are missing here is that it takes more then being even a good fishermen. Your people skills are 80% of what will keep your clients coming back. If people don't like being around you then it doesn't matter if your the best angler to walk the earth, people wont come back. You have to be able to teach people, sometimes people who don't think they need to be taught  You have to make the trip fun! Even if it's a tough day and the fishing is slow, you have to make up for it in other ways.   There is a reason that some guys make it and some guys don't. Paul Castellano is the best example out there. He's the #1 guide in Ontario for a number of reasons. He's a deadly angler, a great host and fun to fish with, extremely diverse and most of all he WORKS HIS ASS OFF. He eat,sleeps and breaths fishing.  There are TONS of guys out there who are happy to take your money, some are worth every penny and some are just in it for a quick buck."
409506,trapshooter,2009-12-08 00:04:00,1234," That's a great point!  If you're not a people person, you're done.  You have to be able to read people and adapt to different personalities.  Some groups I guide, we're laughing our faces off, while others are dead serious.  You have to be ready to guide young children, which takes more time and patience and also cater to the elderly.  Heck, I guided an old fella one time who couldn't even get his own rain pants on when it started to pour.... so there I was dressing my guest and making sure he didn't feel bad about it either.  A huge element is communication.  It's easy to have a great day when you're slamming fish but if things aren't going as well you have to talk through your decisions with your guests and make sure they know you're thinking about every angle and working your ass off to put them on fish.  Most people understand that all days aren't created equal and fishing is fishing... but for those who don't and believe that because they hired a guide they are entitled to the best day fishing they've ever had... well, that's different and you have to be able to handle that and make sure they are satisfied too."
409538,McQ,2009-12-08 01:12:00,38,"I fish and do a bit of guiding on the Gouin Reservoir and have been doing so for the last 29 years.  When dealing with a customer of a lodge or my own guests I start things off with a bit of Q & A just to see where the experience level is and make suggestions based on what we share.  Starting with a chart of the area we plan to fish and a weather pattern for the previous three days. I explain the affect weather can have on the fish and then relate appropriate areas to fish from the chart. The Gouin like most bodies of water has community holes and I really like to avoid them if possible.  The ride out to a target site can take 15 - 30 minutes, I use this time to discuss baits, depths and surrounding structure including shorelines.  Upon arrival I usually have a pretty good idea of what skills are in play and what teaching can be employed that will create an experience for the guest.  We will fish for three hours or so, take a break for shore lunch (weather permitting) and continue to fish after eating until 4:30 or so. A typical day doesn't exist, everbody's skill level is different and my only goal is to be sure that what transpires in the boat will be of benefit to the guest vitually anywhere he or she may fish in the future.  The entire day is non stop free exchange of information and is really appreciated by the guests.  If dinner is early and its possible to get out in the evening for a bit of a fish - we go.  In general chart reading, sonar interpretation, GPS trails, bait selection & why, equipment, boat control, trolling & jigging methods and many other topics will be covered.  Its really amazing when you fish with folks over a period of time and here I mean years who are there because we have fun, fish are caught and most of all a bond has been formed.  To me - that's what its all about."
409586,trapshooter,2009-12-08 02:27:00,1234," Wow, great post!!  That's what guiding is all about"
409603,Rustic-Fisher,2009-12-08 02:57:00,826," BANG!!!!! Hit the nail right on the head!!! Like many, I fish a Northern Trib 3-4 times a week(post reports only a few times LOL) River fishing is hit and miss. We all know its a timing thing, sure there will always be that pool that holds fish during low water conditions or that pool that you will pound them in on a Saturday morning all by yourself  because of its remote location but introduce a few anglers (paying or not) and say good bye to your sure thing!! Having worked in the fishing industry for 3 years part time I can't stress how important it is for lack of a better word ""to guard"" your river spots with your life LOL.. I book a guide service on unknown water don't think for a second I don't have my GPS running and marking all the productive pools,  and than going home cross referencing them with google earth and finding the most direct access for when I head back with my fishing buddies whom will never tell anyone LOL. and why would you not! you spent money to get these spots. Just look at what happens when you post pics of a good Rainbow outing, I am sure everyone gets at least three ""just curious where were you PM'S) and I have no problem steering guys in the right direction by offering advice and tips, just not to my honey holes. I guess in the long run Guiding is a huge responsibility that one take's on when ""guiding"" other fishermen. Really consider the impact it will leave on the water shed you choose to guide on, if its what you want GO FOR IT, just put something back in the long run. RF"
409755,troutologist,2009-12-08 15:21:00,951,"Maybe I missed this in the fray. But does paying for a guided trip entitle you to clock spots on your GPS.  Maybe this is where the only guiding out of town folks comes in.  Perhaps if asked some guys will allow this but who knows.  Like everyone, using tips and help when fishings new areas is a great starting point but still nothing beats dialing in your own spots."
409767,DRIFTER_016,2009-12-08 16:21:00,10439,"  Marking guides spots with your GPS is generally frowned upon unless it is a remote location (i.e. fly in, canoe in etc)"

409800,McQ,2009-12-08 17:27:00,38,"While some folks frown upon marking spots with a GPS waypoint, my personal take when it comes to walleye fishing is that the fish are constantly on the move so today's hotspot could be as vacant as a shopping center parking lot after midnight. Sure there will be some fish but the percentages are against you.  The same thing applies to community holes, ""they're not biting today"" says it all.  I prefer to teach a bit of science so you are enabled to locate fish relative to what is happening in their environment regardless the time & place."
409804,Terry,2009-12-08 17:36:00,14456,"I think the word guide implies showing you spots and why wouldn't you take waypoints to help you remember  the spots you paid for   way up north you hire a guide the the first day or two to show you the spots,then fish them the rest of the week, you paid for them and the guide expects you to continue fishing them... you pay for a guide and they have to expect you to be back  think of all those native guides that helped map out Canada..can you see them sitting in the tee pee saying I showed them the route to the north west but they had better not come back"

408963,ChrisK,2009-12-06 13:05:00,2772," Pardon me but I don't agree Lew...Your pretty much saying if you don't put people on too big fish consistently your not guide material but just a wannabe scammer. That may very well be the way it is in the muskie fishing industry but I don't think its the way it is across the board. If your a trophy hunter then you go out and hire a trophy hunter guide but most people just want to get out to unfamiliar waters with a guide and have a memorable day.From what I can remember not only does the guide offer up some fishing experience but also offers his knowledge of the area. Also, alot of people that hire guides come with fishing experience but just want to be taken to new waters for a day without having to haul a boat or rent a cabin and such. You got to understand that not everyone is a trophy hunter including myself. I'm a recreational type fisherman that enjoys going out, taking in some fresh air and if I catch fish its a bonus. I guess these days its all about your expectations when you go out looking for your fishing guide ???? Check out this link. http://www.great-fishing.com/"
408969,Garnet,2009-12-06 13:26:00,2056,"Being a guide has nothing to do with your fishing ability.  A guide's job is to get clients to catch fish. What that means most of the time is to dum it down.  As a guide you get very few seasoned clients, most you start by teaching rod and real mechanics get them making decent consistent cast, then you put the boat in position to catch fish.  Great Lakes trolling charters takes the rod out of the clients hands but now you better be entertaining.  When you hire a U.S. guide they are mostly licensed and that means safety first not weather they are good anglers.  Garnet"

408975,lew,2009-12-06 13:47:00,12766," And your certainly entitled to your opinion Chris.  I'm talking about about people who call themselves guides and charge clients $$$$ but can't put them  onto big fish or even numbers because THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE THEMSELVES. If you don't know yourself, how can you guide paying customers to the spots that hold them ??  Anybody can hang out a guide shingle and pretend to know what their doing, but in my opinion that's nothing more than a scam. Take out in-experienced folks and put on an act and you can look like a real pro, but a fisherman that knows his stuff would see right thru the act.  It's one thing to offer a free seat in your boat to maybe help a newbie out, but to put on a guides hat & charge for your knowledge that you don't have it is nothing more than stealing to me.  I'm not a hunter nor do I have a gun, although I used be, but I could easily pass the test, buy a gun and then hire myself out as a hunting guide to newbies and wander the woods with them and pretend to be an expert. Tell enuff tales and how would they know the difference ??  No different that fishing guides.  All I'm saying is some guys pretend to be what their not and take $$$$ for things their not entitled to.  I personally know of people that are charging $$$$ to be a guide when they couldn't catch a big fish in a rain barrel with a pitch fork, yet they talk like their a leading expert on the sport.  As I said in my original post.......nuthin worse than a scammer."
408976,Krisco,2009-12-06 13:50:00,67,"John,  I had to go back and read your thread over again,,, is this post really about becoming a guide or is it about using the skills and knowledge that we have all acquired in our chosen fields and finding a way to make money using these skills by selling them to others ???  This might be the path that you have taken to make a few extra bucks and if it works for you so be it, doesn't mean that it's for everyone.

408979,ChrisK,2009-12-06 14:07:00,2772," Good point Krisco...I think he touched off on a little of everything on his original post but things just ended up going towards the fishing end, go figure !!"
408993,JohnF,2009-12-06 14:42:00,3494,"  I can think of lots of hobbies that happily involve making money. Any of you who have ever raced motorized vehicles for fun know how important even little cash prizes are towards the costs of operation. There are those who would say professional hockey players are just grown up boys still playing their favourite game, albeit for millions of bux. All kinds of collectors sell off certain things to allow them to buy better collectibles. Athletes with aspirations to higher levels of attainment look for financial help to cover the cost of their efforts to excel. I know successful amateur golfers who sell off valuable prizes.  And sometimes those who excel want to share their excellence, not hide it under a barrel, so why shouldn't they accept money from aspirants to that same level of excellence willing to pay to learn?  The problem with excellence is generally it costs a lot to achieve. In the case of sportfishing it means probably not settling for my $50 - $100 rods and $100 - $150 reels or my $100 set of waders (felt soled boots included), rather going for the two and three hundred dollar spinning reels, the three to five hundred dollar baitcasters, and $500 - $1,000 centrepins, the thousand dollar rods (I once met a flyfisherman with what he claimed were two $2,000 rods in his car) and so on. It means spending a lot of money for multiple trips every year to faraway spots in Northern Ontario, or the American west in search of little bitty trout in drainage ditches, and even Alaska in some cases, eh, Mike? It means buying and discarding a variety of fishing lines until you find the one that's truly the best instead of letting economics rule and settling for the first or even second one you bought. Some serious fishermen wouldn't dream of getting more than one year out of their lines, even braids. Guys like me will run the line till it starts to break off.  As for giving up one's hard-earned secrets, the fact is that only a small percentage of what the teacher imparts is retained so it would take as least as long as it took the teacher to learn the stuff to get a paying student to remember it. There's little danger of ever having your brain that thoroughly picked. And besides, even if the beneficiary of the collected wisdom absorbs, comprehends and retains it all the donor doesn't lose anything at all. It's all still squirreled away in his little fishing crazy brain. And in all likelihood a teacher would seldom come anywhere close to sharing all the secrets, only enough to impress the student. In fact the act of sharing probably does a lot to reinforce certain skills and knowledge in the teacher, not to mention the satisfaction taken from seeing someone proud of their own improvement.  Access to good guiding and encouragement to the inexperienced fishermen to use it should produce not only a higher skill and knowledge level, but perhaps more importantly a higher ethical standard among fishermen. I don't believe all the bad things done in the name of fishing are anything more than a lack of understanding of how the fishery and the critters need to be protected. There will always be those who will transgress for their own reasons but if we could eliminate the unintentionally unethical fishermen from the scene it would sure help.  And that brethren, is my sermon for this sunny Sunday morning. We will now pass the plates for your generous offerings.  Bless you, my children.  JF"

Among the things I want to learn are to tie lures, bait my hooks properly, maintain my own gear, unhook my catch, clean my own fish, etc. I'd expect to be shown properly - once, then I'd want to practise those things knowing that the expert wasn't too far away in case I screw it up. I'm not talking about a deep sea fishing tour where there are deckhands to bait my hooks, chum the water, gaff the catch and even tell me when I have a fish on. I don't want someone to clean my fish at the end of the day. I want to learn to do it myself. I'm the kind of people I'd want to guide. The rest I'd turn down.  JF"

409000,JohnF,2009-12-06 14:56:00,3494, I would say that any guide who takes strangers to his very best spots deserves to lose them.  If folks need a guide to show them the ropes then they aren't gonna know good from great. If someone becomes a repeat client then eventually the guide may feel comfortable with sharing knowing that he can trust them. Or maybe the guiding is to spots the guide has never worked before. I'd far sooner go to some far northern river with someone like Mike than with just some of my buddies. I expect he'd be better at reading the water and finding fish in strange water than most of us.

I posted this as one relatively new to fishing (after a 5 decade hiatus at least). Now that I have gotten comfortable with bass fishing I would like to have someone as knowledgable as Mike show me around some rivers to help me get the fundamentals float fishing down instead of fumbling with knots and gear and perhaps giving up in frustration.  I was fortunate enought to run across Garry2rs who showed me a whole bunch I didn't know and took me out on his bassboat to boot. I had a lot of fun, saw a lot of techniques I'd never have figured out on my own, learned to cast better, even with a baitcaster, and picked up a lot of tidbits about bassfishing generally that I now can apply when I go wading around here. Sure, I'd love to catch the monsters Lew's talking about, but aren't monsters the exception, not the rule. As soon as they become commonplace, they're not special any longer. I'm happy as a clam just catching decent fish with some small degree of competence.  I didn't mean to get into the relative merits of guides, only what the value of the right guide could be to a neophyte fisherperson, and why aren't more of the accomplished fishermen getting a little money back from it. If I was an accomplished fisherperson then I might be tempted to try to buy an expert like Lew into taking me out on a musky hunt but since the only muskies I've ever seen alive were either in an aquarium or hanging in the lee of a wreck in the St.Lawrence 30 feet below the surface then I'd settle for any puny little musky that might be willing to chomp down on my lure. Given the old saw about muskies being the fish of 10,000 casts, or was it 100,000, then I'd consider myself privileged to be shown around by someone with Lew's expertise. My question doesn't preclude Musky experts letting their hard earned knowledge pay for new boats and gear.  JF"

409029,steverowbotham,2009-12-06 16:05:00,1800,"I've been guiding for 5 seasons now, and every year my client base continues to grow.  I can't tell anyone that I'm the most experienced guy out there because it's not true.  I guarantee that guys like Greg Klatt and Paul Castellano can bring more to the table as far as experience goes.  But being 23, thats expected.  I feel I have accomplished a lot in the 5 years I have been doing this.  I've been fishing minimum 80-120 days a year since I was 15 years old, and that kind of time on the water is experience and knowledge.  As a guide, I love it.  I love putting people on fish and sharing knowledge and passion for the sport.  I have still not had a fishless day out there with a client and I am very proud of that.  As I get older, people seem to put more trust in me, and again, thats expected.  I had 4 time, a 3 time repeats this season, and it happens for a reason.  I pre-fish for guiding clients.  If I have to meet them at 8am, I'm there at first light, and I'll scout the lake for an hour an a half. If I have an afternoon 4-8 charter, I might go as early as 10am to fish without hooks or try and spot shallow fish.  It's paid off many times.  In general, when you pay for a guide, you're getting your money's worth."
409031,NAC,2009-12-06 16:15:00,369, It has to be that way.
409032,Reelpro,2009-12-06 16:20:00,73,"Hi  Why not ?  From a guide's perspective.  I am fairly new to the guiding business. I am not a river fisherman, I just guide on inland lakes and GB.  Anyone looking to get into the business of guiding needs to really check out all the new Transport Canada rules and regulations and training requirements, that have come into effect in Canada in Oct 2009.  There are a lot of guys out there who guide sort of under the table. They do not actually have a licenced business, they often do not have the safety/ first aid equipment that is required by law. They do not have insurance, they don't have the proper boat registration, pay taxes, etc, etc.  Charter operators are now required to have a Small Commercial Vessel Operators Certificate, or a Master's Limited depending on their boat size. This means anyone receiving $$$ for taking people out fishing in a boat. Does'nt matter if it is a car topper with oars, or a Canoe, or a 30 foot Great Lakes charter boat. Lots of guys in for a surprise this coming season, when OPP inspect their Bass boat, for TC approval, documents, Federal registration etc.  To be a ""legal"" Charter operator in central Ontario, I posses and carry with me Liability Insurance, SVOP Certificate, RROC Certificate, MEDA3 Certificate, First Aid/CPR Certificate, PCOC Card, Federal Boat Registy #  Does any of this make me a good fisherman - no. It is all the ""red tape"" required to operate legally, and the reason is to have the charter operator/guide have some training in how to safely drive his boat, maintain a safe ship, in my case a 22' bowrider with an outboard, and have some emergency/first aid training.  In our litigeous society we live in now, where people sue because the coffee is to hot, I would be wary even guiding people river fishing. Think their family might have a problem with a ""guide"" who took a guy out wading and he slipped and fell, hit his head, drowned?  Lawsuit? Better set up a business and get it insured, get some first aid and emergency training, etc etc. In this country we live in its called ""Due Diligence"" a nice term for do everything you can think of to cover your ass in case of an accident.  Re the fun stuff, the actual fishing.  It is still a blast. I have as much fun taking out charter customers as I do fishing with friends. The best days are still someone's first. Their very first fish they've ever caught, or their first Muskie, Pike, Channel Catfish etc. I guide lots of families, kids, and people new to fishing, so its a real kick to watch them when a big fish gets on.  I rarely have ""meat"" fisherman, as I fish heavily fished lakes in Muskoka, Kawartha, Haliburton, so I tell most enquiries that are looking to take home cooler loads, to go up north. There are drive to lakes, within 6 hrs of Toronto that you can catch 50 walleye a day per person. Most groups will keep a few fish to eat, but many just want the experience of it.  It is always a great day on the water. Just to take in the environment, the fresh air, sights and wildlife of a beautiful Ontario Lake. Some days the fishing part is fantastic - dozens of fish caught, other days its just a few, but the adventure of fishing is the fun.  For anyone seriously looking to take up guiding as a business, or if you already do it and need some of the training or certifications the gov't is requiring, check out the OSGA Ontario Sportfishing Guides Association. www.ontariofishcharters.ca They can help with the red tape and training.

409058,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-06 18:21:00,0,The truely sad part about being a guide and having your spots lost to clients and is what keeps most away from guiding. No amount of money is worth showing people where you have spent your entire life fishing. A lot of new wanna be guides out there have done exactly that. They take clients to Other people spots. The spots that they have learned from other true guides and if it wasnt for the true guide who took them...none of the wanna be guides would even have a business.
409107,solopaddler,2009-12-06 20:08:00,8605,"  I came very close to achieving that 3 years ago, had several networks interested and my partner and I had already filmed one episode. Such are the vagaries of life though, the project was scuttled just as it was taking off.  There's been some excellent points made regarding why not to be a river guide. These are some of the very reasons that have caused me to hedge on doing it. I do belive that a balance could be struck and it could be done properly though. First and foremost would be ""where?"". I have a few ideas..."
409124,Meegs,2009-12-06 20:47:00,249,"I know that I had thought long and hard about starting up a guiding business for river fishing, but finally came to the conclusion that it just wasnt worth it, too many spots to loose.  Its one thing if your going to guide from a boat.   Not that many people in general have a boat.  alot of people cant afford buying a boat or are willing to spend the $  to buy all the gear involved.   So spending $$ on a guide that will take you out and show you how its done is well worth it.  they'll pay for the experience alone cause ITS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN JUST GO AND DO ON ANY GIVEN DAY.  Where as if you go and guide people on rivers....   all they need is the gas $$$ and a car and a bit of walking effort and they will get there! I think the thing is that with a boat you have so many options where to go, what to fish for, and have a good chunk of the season to fish. With the Rivers or shore fishing there's only so many public access spots!   And i know that there are only room for afew people per hole in most rivers.  crowds are never fun on rivers.  I know it wouldnt be fun trying to show a newbie how to fish a river or a hole and have other guys casting over lines, and i know id be pissed the first time i took a new client out, drove an hour and half, or couple hours walked a half hour to hit a certain hole and show up at the crack of dawn and have the people you took out last week and 3 of there buddies along for the ride hitting fish in your best hole while your new client is looking at you like what the hell??    And you know what? I  cant say I'd blame the guys for going there either!  hey..   its public access, ANYONE can fish it!  I thik it may be different if it were a large river like the niagra or rivers in BC.   but even out there you see the river guides all using drift boats to get to there places.  its one thing if the people are flying in  or driving from far off places to have a fishing trip of a lifetime, but id be careful when its people in your own backyard."
408858,JohnF,2009-12-06 00:54:00,3494,"A couple of passing comments to Solopaddler on a current thread got me thinking about this guiding business. And I don't mean me, unless someone is unsure of their way in the wonderful world of real estate.  But that's a perfect analogy. I've spent years learning more than the average realtor about the business, to the point where I now prostitute myself to teach real estate hopefuls preparing for their licenses and licensed realtors wanting to better themselves. I don't feel the least bit guilty about it. I worked hard to acquire that knowledge and I figure I deserve to be compensated for that effort. And I'm reasonably sure the people who take my classes feel they get their money's worth.  So how come more accomplished fisherpersons like Mike (Solopaddler) aren't getting something back for the wealth of knowledge they share with the rest of us? I'm only using Mike as an example (hope you don't mind) because his name was mentioned in this regard.  I know a few here are doing that, some to a greater degree than others, and no one seems to begrudge the full bore charter guys their due. In fact there's a lot of positive support and promotion for some of them right here on the group. I know of others, like Garry2rs, who use guiding to help pay for boat gas and some tackle, and the folks who do commission him get way more than their money's worth. I learned more on his boat in a few hours than I've learned by trial and error, even with the advantage of OFC as a resource, in several years of fishing alone. Having seen what one gets for the money I gotta say it's a bargain for anyone wanting to fish from a Ranger bassboat, learn an awful lot about fishing the Kawarthas, and be coached in the fundamentals of casting with a spinning reel or baitcaster. And I'm sure there are lots of other folks here just as accomplished and accommodating as Garry.  But back to my question. Why aren't more people like Solopaddler selling their bodies and minds to fishermen? It's obvious from his reports that he has a wealth of knowledge about fishing. And he knows how to find fish. His steelheading reports recently are ample proof of that. Seems to me it would be bonus for tyro fishermen like me to feel comfortable about asking guys like Mike and Garry to squire me around for a day or more, teaching me to do it right, putting me on fish and making my fishing a lot more fun. And I'd feel comfortable in asking simply because I'd be prepared to pay for their time and expertise.  The problem these guys always come up with is that they feel uncomfortable making a business out of their pleasure, and of charging someone who might become a friend, etc etc. That's actually wrong headed because it's exactly the same rationale I might apply for not asking for their help, because I don't want to be putting some near stranger on the spot to do me a favour. Why should he?  As far as I'm concerned these guys like Garry & Mike owe it to themselves to put a fair price on this knowledge and skill they've acquired. They've spent far more time & money than the average angler trying and replacing equipment and tackle, travelling to the faraway spots, passing up overtime to go fishing, etc. Now they're in a position to share that wealth with those of us who didn't invest in the same way, so why not get compensated?  Any thoughts?  JF"

408876,StoneFly,2009-12-06 01:31:00,574,"Two years ago,...when I was still a relative Newb to CP fishing,...I kept seeing all these posts from stateside,...with like 20-30 fish per day while up here we were getting 1, 2 or 3 per day,...and it was a dry fall....anyways,..I posted something like 'Willing to pay for guiding to the U.S'  and I got 2 replies,....one from Louis who wanted to charge me like $300 or so,..and one from Mike who said,..Yo bud,...share the gas and lets see if we can make it work....I never ended up doing either,..and I think Mike thinks Im a Loogan now...lol,..due to my off the cuff sarcastic humour that some get, some dont,....but thats ok,..anyone who has met me on the river knows Im a good guy and I can fish well.  I know another guide who frequents this board sometimes,...and I fish with him often,....I think the general consesus for Chronic steelheaders not wanting to become guides or charge for it is as follows:  1)  they dont want to give away their spots to complete strangers,...(its not all that lucrative) 2)  they feel bad asking for $$ when they feel great about giving someone the Joy that comes from that first Fish etc.  Im no guide,..although I have thought about it as something for the future as I just keep getting better at it,...but I took a Newbie guy out recently and we had a stellar day and he actually out fished me,....I felt GREAT about him experiencing what he did and I really didnt know him at all before....but the thought never really entered my mnd to charge him for it.  So i think there is a difference between Boat guiding and River guiding,...the lakes are alot Bigger than the rivers and arguabley see 1000x the pressure.  Besides with a boat and down riggers etc etc...I think it is easier to charge people.  that being said,..Im going to venture in to Huron Tribs next year and I would NOT be against paying someone to show me and a buddy or 2 the spots and holes etc....as long as he drives,...lol  Just my $0.02"
408878,Fishnwire,2009-12-06 01:37:00,983,"My buddy who guided said he hated it.  He told me the pressure to put his clients on fish was tremendous and took a lot of the fun out of the whole process.  If you go fishing with your buddies and don't get fish it's no big deal...If you accept money to take guys out and they do poorly, that's a different story.  He would often spend his evenings pre-fishing just so that he would have something for shore lunch.  I guess it depends on your clientele and their expectations.  After he gave up guiding for walleye he still would take occasional bookings for muskie.  He told me muskie fisherman didn't get bent out of shape and ask for refunds when the fishing was not very good whereas walleye fisherman sometimes did."
408881,JohnF,2009-12-06 01:52:00,3494," Your point's well taken and in many cirumstances I'd probably be inclined to agree but it seems to me that sportfishing may be a little bit different.  I'd probably agree that working riggers and rods on a charter boat trolling around a lake could cut into the pleasure quotient, but it isn't quite the same deal when you can use only one rod per person. At least half the benefit for clients on the river might well be seeing the guide actually fishing, watching how he casts, retrieves, finds and works spots, controls the line on a drift, etc.  And there's a certain amount of encouragement in seeing the guide hauling in fish. At least you now know they're there and that you just have to do the right things to attract them. I know for sure that I've learned as much by just watching how Garry does things as listening to his explanations. In that case I pay attention to what kind of rod and reel he's using for the different kinds of baits, how he presents them, how he retrieves, etc.  And I'm sure there's plenty to be learned by copying a human fishfinder like Mike on the river. I like the idea of getting out with someone who can tell me the best baits to use for the day, check the way my gear is rigged, show me the spots to fish and perhaps best of all take me to places I may never find on my own.

408931,timmeh,2009-12-06 04:25:00,609,"  I think this is bang on. I would be willing to bet this is what stops many people from offering to guide. It's one thing to take a friend out who appreciates fishing the same way you do (and will keep your spots quite), and another to take a complete stranger.  John, I see where you're coming from with it being great to learn from a guide. Personally I plan on taking up fly fishing next spring and will hire a guide or 2 to help me get started. And I won't care how many fish I actually catch myself, I just want to learn from that person. BUT I suspect most people who hire guides aren't really in it for the learning, first and foremost they want to catch fish. And a lot of people want to take as many fish home as they can. And you have to be willing to cater to these people, even if your attitude is completely different. And so you need to take them to your best spots to ensure they do well. And what happens then....  Once you take someone to your best spots they tell people, and they tell people who tell a couple more people, and then you're spending your own fishing time finding new spots to constantly take clients to, because your old hotspots aren't the same. As well I'd bet that people who spend the time and $ earning the knowledge to become a great fisherman understand the importance of taking care of our resources and recognize the need to practice C & R or selective harvest. I wonder how these guys would enjoy taking people out who are really only interested in taking a limit home. How would you feel taking 2 guys to your best steelhead spot on river X and watch them take their limit home. And 2 days later when you come back and they're there with 2 buddies all with the kill chains out."
408934,danc,2009-12-06 04:52:00,4677,"I think that it depends on where and what you're guiding for. Lake Ontario (or Superior in my case) Salmon and Lake Trout charters are fine with me. By the way. Is there a difference between a guided trip and a charter?? When the internet became mainstream, and I be came interested in it, I built a web page on Nipigon Brook Trout fishing. Just for fun. The offers that I had for guiding were non stop. I refused them all simply because selling my spots and techniques after 25 years of learning them by myself weren't worth a few hundred bucks (and I'm being modest here. I had offers in the quad digits). I did see one person guiding where I fish. And I've seen his client back every year since.  Guiding on a remote fly in location is fine. You know that the clients aren't going to be back with their friends every year and rape your lake."

I can count on one hand the number of guests I wanted to drown though. That's not too bad for 25 years.

Even though I have done a lot of guiding I would never guide rivers for steelies, way too much competition for spots.

To do well,better spend more time on the water than on dry land Alot of sacrifices have to be made,its a way of life I dont fully agree about a hobby can be ruined by work,it all dependent on how you re-focus your enjoyment If you like catching fish,It may not be the thing for you unless you fish with clients(some do and some dont).If you progress more towards knowing about the fish than catching them and focus on the moments experienced with others then you might succeed.  The critical thing in business is setting up a good business plan and have set forecasted goals with an outlaid plan on how to get there.Having a business Policy ,where clients respect those policies in place.Some will respect them and and some wont,those that dont you just move on.(Reminds me of a George Carlin funny,Humans are gonna save the planet but we have yet to learn how to respect one another and love one another). Knowing the possibilities and limitations of such a venture is of great importance Considering long term possibilities is the key to survival  also one must consider the importance of knowing and having a first aid course with all the needed equipment in case of a situation. Informing one self about the legalities and liabilities covering this commercial activity  Like most business,build it by design and adapt as the curve of evolution in the business evolves  I owned a good business for some 15 years and did 100 or so of guiding days a year,I sold it some years ago now and never looked backed. For me ,its not a job,its the way I live  One does not run a guide or chartering business or lodge because he is good at it,its because its the way they choose to live Those that dont,I suppose it explains why they are miserable about it  Gary2r's  I live in Good Earth"
408956,lew,2009-12-06 11:18:00,12766," I've never personally had much of an interest in river fishing, but if I ever did want to learn about it, Mike would definetely be the guy I'd want to teach me. He's excellent at what he does and has obviously spent a huge amount of time learning the techniques that work.  But on the other hand, what about guys who hire themselves out as guides who infact aren't really that good at fishing, but can put on a huge front and pretend to be experts with many years of experience under their belts.  It's easy to take relatively in-experienced fishermen on your boat and spin huge yarns about how good you are, when  they really don't know the difference, and make yourself look like some sort of pro in front of them.  The way I look at it, folks hire a guide to learn new lakes and the spots that produce the fish, or else their out for a trophy or at least to fill their stringers.  Now, what happens when you hire a guide who, even though he tells big stories and pretends to be an expert at everything related to fishing, when infact he doesn't really have that much experience and hasn't even caught any big fish himself.  If you don't have the knowledge or experience to catch them yourself, how can you possibly charge someone else to take them out.  Fishing websites are interesting to read and it's very easy to pick out the folks that are truly good at fishing, compared to the folks who AREN'T really that good, yet who pretend to be experts. It's really quite easy to collect information from books, the internet, or from talking to other fishermen, then turn that info into your own words and come off as the actual expert.  Folks who are inexperienced or new to fishing are easily fooled by these shams and put these people on pedestals, where they certainly don't belong.  I guess I got off topic a bit, but reading this very interesting post about people becoming guides really made me mad when I think of those who hire themselves out as guides or experts, when they themselves aren't nearly as good as they pretend to be.  My point is, if you've only ever caught dink muskies or average size bass, or any other species for that matter, because you really don't know where the big girls live yourself, or how to catch them, how can you possibly call yourself a guide and charge folks $$$$ for your services.  Remember folks, just because a person pretends to be an expert or a fishing guide, doesn't neccesarily means it's true.  It's easy to collect information from others and turn it into your own words to make yourself look like the experts, but good fishermen can easily pick you out of the crowd.  Nuthin worse than a scammer."
