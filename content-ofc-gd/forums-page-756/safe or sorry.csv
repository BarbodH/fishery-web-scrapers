410274,bubbles,2009-12-09 20:58:00,591,"Being first out there and alone is dumb, no matter what you are wearing or ho wprepared you think you are.  It's early, go back to the store and buy a few more jigs, the cold is coming go next week."
410276,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-09 21:03:00,0,you just posted to rub it in didnt you......  
410290,limeyangler,2009-12-09 21:25:00,5204,"  LIKE I""D DO THAT!!!"
410293,anders,2009-12-09 21:28:00,1168," That image should eliminate the last two graphics...I never did like seeing vehicles on ice, regardless of the thickness of the ice, should be illegal in my opinion."
410306,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-09 21:40:00,2582,"4+ is plenty. Just be safe. One year I went to Lefroy on Simcoe for perch. It was first ice. When I got there I saw one person WAAAAYYYY out there in the deeper water sitting on a white pail and fishing away. So without checking I figured it would be more then safe in the shallower water where I was heading.  Headed for my spot...had to cross a pressure crack on the way out and it never even phased me. Got to my spot and started cutting a hole. Didn't even make 3 turns and I was through...less then 3 inches of ice for sure. Now I was pooping my pants and 300 yards off shore. Didn't even fish...but made my way back to shore. That pressure crack on the way back in was infinitely more intimidating then it was on the way out let me tell you.  I made it back safe but I never ever went on first ice again without doing the spud, step, spud, step.  Have at her Simon. Be safe and give us a nice report with some fish porn."
410308,troutologist,2009-12-09 21:46:00,951,"  Im not a big fan either, but seems like its the way to go out here. Once the ice is 40""+ I might consider it.  Dont want to find out if the truck is a good submarine."
410309,Ron,2009-12-09 21:50:00,1683,I would have been out there 2 inches ago! (Provided there is no snow on it at the time) If there is snow on the 4 inches of ice now it should be more than safe enough.
410320,Michael_Brown,2009-12-09 22:04:00,411,"I would suggest not listening to Ron about ice safety unless you would like to make the news. People call 911 when they see Ron heading out on the ice.  Come on Ron, I dare you to say I'm wrong."
410323,Ron,2009-12-09 22:07:00,1683,  
410324,T Fisher,2009-12-09 22:07:00,139,Walk slowly and carry a chipper. My chipper takes out a inch of ice with every hit. If you hit the same hole 4 times and you don't see water your good to go.  Have fun.
410329,irishfield,2009-12-09 22:14:00,26272, You serious... it's a way of life for MANY.  
410330,Jer,2009-12-09 22:14:00,1426,"  You must be a liberal...let's just make everything illegal, then everybody would be safe. Gotta love the ""nanny state"".  If common sense is applied, there's no reason to keep vehicles off the ice when it's safe. Just tell Wayne he can't drive to his cottage in the winter (I know, I know...he would just fly in), but if you had your way, I guess planes would be verboten on the ice as well."
410336,irishfield,2009-12-09 22:19:00,26272,"I can land the airplane on ice and it will stay up.. and when I step out I will go thru !! Why my buddy always carried a large hatchet on a rope!  1600 lbs / 24 square feet of ski = 66.7 lb/sq ft pressure on the ice.  Me at 220lb / 0.5 sq ft per boot = 440 lbs/sq ft pressure.  Same stupidity when the OPP drove out in their 8000 lb suburban to tell my neighbour he was a threat to public safety with his wide track old John Deer dozer on the ice. The dozer had a lighter ""foot print"" than the OPP truck that pulled up RIGHT beside him!"
410338,Michael_Brown,2009-12-09 22:21:00,411,Good Thing Ron doesn't drive a bulldozer. 
410345,irishfield,2009-12-09 22:33:00,26272,Yah.. but he does drive a truck and trailer..  
410350,Michael_Brown,2009-12-09 22:38:00,411,  Was Ron stuck in that photo or did he just lock his keys inside again?
410356,Fishing 24/7,2009-12-09 22:50:00,709,"i went out on 2.5 inches of ice once,... no snow on top... glair ice...      THEN the sun came out!   the rest is history!   only thing i can say is that i had to switch shorts when i came back home! CRACK A LACKLING!"
410134,limeyangler,2009-12-09 15:33:00,5204,"thought i'd try a poll...messed it up....lol   Anyway...whadaya think...this is the thickness of ice i have out the front of the house....inched around 10 feet out checking as i went.  I'm pretty confident it is pretty much the same thickness all over the bay as it froze all at once....depth of the bay pretty even, and no deeper than 15'.   So....should i do it....get an evening icefishing session....lol...i think my mind is already made up actually...just thought i'd throw that out in the forum out of interest.    ICE CHUNK I HACKED OUT WITH AN AXE 10 FEET FROM SHORE  "
410137,muddler,2009-12-09 15:51:00,623,"My dad told me, ""You can play safe anytime and often, you can be sorry only once if you risk your life.""   6 inches is the minimum for me.  muddler"
410138,bigugli,2009-12-09 15:55:00,6138,Wait one more night for that extra inch.
410140,anders,2009-12-09 16:07:00,1168,Good Luck tonight!
410141,Terry,2009-12-09 16:09:00,14456,if you are careful and a floater suit go for it
410143,danbouck,2009-12-09 16:12:00,4380,"8"" minimum for me. I am on the bigger side though"
410147,troutologist,2009-12-09 16:18:00,951,"With a buddy I would venture out on less than that.  Like to have 4+ when Im by myself. Just go slow and check often. Keep your spacing if with someone.  By having the appropriate gear, rope, icepicks, life jacket/floater suit you can be prepared for the worst.  You have to be comfortable as the one on the ice. Not me. Constantly twitching because of poor ice is not a fun time."
410151,limeyangler,2009-12-09 16:25:00,5204,  I think what you are referring to is  'the personal pucker factor'
410152,Fishnwire,2009-12-09 16:25:00,983,"I found this online.   4 inches 200 pounds  (one person and gear) 5 inches 800 pounds (one snowmobile) 7 inches 1,500 pounds (group of people) 8 inches 2,000 pounds (one car)   In all honsety, one winter in my youth I was the first guy to fish Ramsey Lake in Sudbury for the season.  There was little more than 3 inches.  There's a walking trail right where I went on the ice and was fishing and people who passed by were yelling at me to ""get off the ice you crazy kid,""  I decided to get off when I noticed that my dog running on the ice was causing the ice to deflect, as evidenced by the raising and falling water line in my hole.  Don't be stupid like me, be smart like you.   You get a real sick feeling when you put the blades of your auger against the ice, push down, turn only four times and you're through."
410161,Twocoda,2009-12-09 16:38:00,4130,when in doubt ...dont go out ...2 feet of ice isnt think enough for me ...
410182,johnnyb,2009-12-09 17:14:00,3413,"4 inches I'd be out there...maybe wearing a life jacket...definitely with my ice-picks out and hanging at my side, not jammed in my pockets."
410186,irishfield,2009-12-09 17:20:00,26272,Our neighbours at the lake would die for that much ice right now... with them stuck on their island with only an inch of ice on the lake (and him with a broken leg in a cast). I'd be on it Simon... properly dressed and prepared.
410193,gone_fishin,2009-12-09 17:40:00,481,4 inches... what are you waiting for? lol. i was on 3 inches last year on Simcoe over 110 fow. floater suit was worn obviously.
410194,pike slayer,2009-12-09 17:41:00,1177,if i was you i'd be out there right now lots of ice for walking out. just check often and go with a buddy and you'll be fine bring back pics! make us jealous!
410195,pike slayer,2009-12-09 17:41:00,1177,if i was you i'd be out there right now lots of ice for walking out. just check often and go with a buddy and you'll be fine bring back pics! make us jealous!

410201,trapshooter,2009-12-09 17:52:00,1234,"so let me get this straight.... you already walked out on the ice.... CHOPPED a hole in it..... and DIDN'T drop a line!?!?!  Personally, I'd be all over that, Simon.   Your call though..."
410203,Spiel,2009-12-09 17:54:00,9065,"Yep, I'd be on it. Properly dressed and prepared but I'd be on it."
410207,NAW,2009-12-09 18:08:00,4022,Giver..  It would be good to have a buddy with ya though..
410211,Leecher,2009-12-09 18:19:00,7832,"Personally I wouldn't go.... I'd wait til you see a report from us first    joke joke Kidding aside...... looks like you have 3"" inches of good black ice, go for it but don't venture out too far.  Have fun Simon and be safe!!! Jacques"
410221,Harrison,2009-12-09 19:36:00,2202,"Yep, good enough for me.  But I'd probably spud out to be safe with first ice.  Is it spring fed?"
410224,Dara,2009-12-09 19:41:00,3052,"Its your call. For me, If I stand at shore and have to decide if there is enough ice or not, then its not.  Its either safe, or I don't go"
410242,Sinker,2009-12-09 20:17:00,8692,"I'd giver. Spud your way out. Whack the ice, take a step.......repeat. You can hear the sound change if your getting closer to thinner/softer ice. You'll be fine.  S."
410250,Big Cliff,2009-12-09 20:26:00,6899,"With a buddy, survival suit, and a long rope ATTACHED, go for it. There might be 4"" of ice on that bay but one spring under the ice and you could easily find yourself swimming. ONE mistake could easily be the last one you will ever make."
410269,limeyangler,2009-12-09 20:55:00,5204,"Hey All,  interesting to see the range of opinion. seems like 3 main trends in the reply.....  1) What the hell ya waiting for!  2) Go....but with all the safety equipment and a buddy  3) your nuts....dont go!    Well i was intending to go with number 2 option but my buddy could'nt make it....gawd knows he wanted to, so i decided not to go.  Guess it all comes down to your own 'personal pucker factor'....lol....and i'd be a puckerin' for sure...not my idea of a relaxing time even if i avoid the icy plunge!   Be safe everyone...   Cheers   Simon"
