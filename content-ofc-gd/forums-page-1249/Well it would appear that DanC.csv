48477,Joey,2007-03-17 22:52:00,9122,"Love your Nascar pics Dan.  C'mon admit it, come out now, you'll feel better once you do  "
48478,Tybo,2007-03-17 22:55:00,1373,"You know Dan there nothing wrong with that, HAAA,HAAA"
48488,danc,2007-03-17 23:11:00,4677,"Well. When it comes to pools and betting, I pick who I think will win. Not who I'm a fan of. Maybe that's why I'm in first???? Do you really think that I'm a fan of this guy??    :wacko:  "
48492,Joey,2007-03-17 23:18:00,9122,"OMG, what a picture  Thanks for the laugh, but why did you put Tony's head on your vacation picture?"
48497,danc,2007-03-17 23:21:00,4677,OOOooooooooooooo..... that's low. But I like it.  It's only race four out of 36. It's gonna be a long season. Plenty of time for cheap shots. By the way. Why are you so sure that I have Smoke tomorrow???
48503,SlowPoke,2007-03-17 23:34:00,2984,"Your ""A"" list is Tony Stewart and Kasey Kahne.... I'm guessing you picked Kahne on a dare or you did it by accident and you're running Stewart tomorrow."
48504,Joey,2007-03-17 23:34:00,9122,"Hahaha, just playing the game Dan  Don't hate the player, hate the game  And after you can't change your pics on Fantasy Auto Racing, you can see everyone's pics, so I usually see who people picked and just generally check things out.  Gotta be in the know, you know  Joey"
48505,Daplumma,2007-03-17 23:39:00,1961,Hes got a 50 50 shot at picking Tony.The problem with this fantasy pool is you can wear out your good guys too early in the season so you have to pace yourself.Love the Tony pic but he's been seeing a trainer this year and is prolly in a little bit better shape than that now.. Joe
48506,danc,2007-03-17 23:39:00,4677,  And I love it Joey. I'm flattered that my picks make front page news.
48507,danc,2007-03-17 23:41:00,4677, We'll see how fast he can climb that fence tomorrow Joe.
48508,SlowPoke,2007-03-17 23:41:00,2984,"Joey, You preselect 2(a),4(,2© before the deadline and accrue qualifying points. Then you select 1(a),2(,1© for the race. You can change your 1(a),2(,1© up until just before the race."
48514,Joey,2007-03-17 23:51:00,9122,"Ahhhh, see I did not know this.  Okay, thanks Slowpoke.  I'll remember that next time.  Joey"
49265,walleyejigger,2007-03-19 19:57:00,876,"WHAT AN IDIOT i am   i thought you had to ride out the 9 races for your original 2 ""A"" 4""B"" and 2""C before you can pick new, drivers  oh well guess sitting in 7th ain't so bad for being a dumbass,"
