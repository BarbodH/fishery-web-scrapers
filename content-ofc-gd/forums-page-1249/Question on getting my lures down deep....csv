49630,ssauvain,2007-03-20 17:24:00,77,"Going to Birch Lake in Mid-July and how do I get my shad raps, and stick baits down deep to the larger walleyes? I am hearing alot about bead chain sinkers...I have never rigged one or know what they are. Might try to get down to some lake trout too...thanks for any and all help!!"
49632,SlowPoke,2007-03-20 17:27:00,2984, Lots of ways to get deep... http://www.luhrjensen.com/prod_list.cfm?categoryID=12
49635,OhioFisherman,2007-03-20 17:39:00,6623,"Never used any of those devices, if I want something to run deeper I take a slip or egg sinker and put it on the line like a carolina rig. Never really used anything heavier than 1 ounce maybe, and only for trolling."
49640,Headhunter,2007-03-20 17:50:00,5703,Offshore snap weights are the ticket! You can change the weight you use to any application and the depth they will travel is dependant on the amount of line let out. Simple easy and flexible. HH
49652,Victor,2007-03-20 18:13:00,1609,maybe try using bottom bouncers? I've never used them much but that's an option.
49683,just2manylures,2007-03-20 19:12:00,144,I seen a product on TV called sticky weight.  You stick it on your line like silly puddy and it is weight.  Maybe worth a try
49693,Steve,2007-03-20 19:29:00,2075,"those chain weights that someone mentioned to you work great.  you use them to connect your mainline to your lead.....often braid to flouro, with the chain weight in the middle....  i like to run 7' leads from the weight to the lure.  your other option, the better option, would be to spool up a larger reel with five colour leadcore.....  but really, you have lots of options."
49738,Markystang,2007-03-20 20:50:00,131,"If you're trolling, check out the fish seeker. I've used them a couple times with success.  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...p;currentPage=0"
49742,Zib,2007-03-20 21:02:00,369,Use some Offshore snap weights or lead core line. You can also try the mini dipsey divers.
49751,Garyv,2007-03-20 21:17:00,547,Rubber core sinkers work great while trolling.  I consider them a cheap mans lead core alternative.
