Long story short, friend bought me a male Beta for x-mas, I decided to pair him up with a female. The fish fought, bite each other. One day, I put them together, the male starts to make bubble nests and later they mated. I must admit, I was really amused with fish porn. Hahaha! A/w pictures worth a thousand words. Enjoy...  ""I'm falling for you!""  ""You are going no where!""  The next few pics are sensored... (lol, actully the fish were camera shy)   Bubble nest from above.  Close up, there's some fish egg in the bubbles.  I was told to wait 2 days or so to let them hatch, but unfortunately they never did. No worries, they can mate once every month. Soon enough I'll have an army of Fighter Fish!"
