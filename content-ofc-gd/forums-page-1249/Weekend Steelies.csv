49158,Josh Rogers,2007-03-19 16:33:00,79,Got out to my fav trib on saturday early. Braved the snow and bad driving cons to try and get into some steel. Went to my spot and found what looked like ice close to shore so I decided to move to another spot. Lots of slush around but managed to fish at my second spot. I was a bit rusty as I missed my first fish. Second bite and I got the hook into this one. A nice 2 lb fish. Then about 5 mins later the float starts doing a dance. Set the hook and land a nice 5 lb male. Moved down to another hole and 1st drift hook into about an 8 lber who promptly snapped my line after jumping and giving me a nice look. Pretty good first day. I'll post the pics when my buddy e-mails them to me.  ATF

49179,trapshooter,2007-03-19 16:54:00,1234,"Hey Josh,  Nice work on the steel!  You'll have to teach me all about the finer points of steelheading at the lodge this summer.  Cheers, ben."

49190,Josh Rogers,2007-03-19 17:10:00,79, You bet Ben. I love teching guys to steelhead and refine their technique. It's great to see a guy with a nice steelie on the end of his line for the first time when you've watched his progression from not knowing anything to getting into his first. That's more exciting for me than getting into them myself.
49191,Josh Rogers,2007-03-19 17:13:00,79,Yeah ccmt. I love that. I had my buddy out for his first time this weekend and that's what I told him. THe best part is when the float goes down. After that it's all a blur! I'll have a pic of a 32 inch musky that I got about a month ago through the ice as well whenever he gets around to sending it to me.
