Kinda tricky as I was really limited on aluminum, but ended up with the right measurements...    I used cutoffs to make a support bracket under the beams and bolted them together...     Got home today and was motivated to trick out the front end abit. I had in mind to have storage in the front, but now theres going to be a smaller compartment. I found these lying around the other day...    make a notch...    Et VOILA! Spinnerbait compartment.   "

49393,Jigger,2007-03-20 00:24:00,1237,Absolutely Clampet. I've already started wondering what I'm going to say to my wife when she finds me sleeping in it
49397,Pigeontroller,2007-03-20 00:34:00,2793,Looks like you're doing a fine job there! Just watch the weight you add!
49401,Jigger,2007-03-20 00:48:00,1237,"Thanks pt. I posted in another thread about the weight difference between the alum and wood. The aluminum braces weigh roughly 1/3 of the same braces made of wood. if anything the boat will be even more stable in rough water. Either way, the major framework is done now. The only extra weight will be from the plywood and carpet. Thanks again ."
