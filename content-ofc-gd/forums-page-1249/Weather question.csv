I know you are not weather predictators but a general temperature????"
49234,douG,2007-03-19 18:50:00,2693,"Figger about 4 - 8 C cooler than Toronto, with similar amounts of precipation.  The days will be significantly longer tho."
49245,Joey,2007-03-19 19:05:00,9122,"It won't matter, you'll need so much bug repellant you might as well wear long johns  Joey"
49246,bassman,2007-03-19 19:11:00,384,"Go to The Weather Network site:  http://www.theweathernetwork.com/index.htm  Plug in the town name  or nearest town, and then go to the historical data."
49346,tjsa,2007-03-19 22:47:00,1578,"Should be in the 20-25C range at that time, but may be higher, or even lower. It all depends on the weather at the time. I remember being out on a boat in late July up near Atikokan, and we were in t-shirts, then a weather system came over us, and soaked us, with.......SNOW, LOL. Only lasted a couple of minutes, sun came back out, and we dried out pretty fast, but it definately was an experience.  A rare experience for sure, but pack some warm clothing, overnight lows can be pretty cool, even in the mid-summer up here, and there. You can always take a layer off when it warms up, hard to get warm if you don't have the clothing. And, yes, like Joey says, long sleeved shirts, high collars, long pants, and gloves, light ones, to protect your hands from sun and skeeters, along with a mosquito head net. I finally bought a head net last year, don't know how I persevered all these years without one. And, they are cheap, only about 7-10 bucks.  It'll probably be light out until around 11 pm up there at that time of year."
49416,camillj,2007-03-20 01:15:00,1988,Word of advice ... get your self a really good bright yellow rain suit .... it will probably be cool enough to wear in the summer heat .. and will double as a bug deterrent ... alot better than slathering up with muskol ... the guys think Im nuts when I wear mine on a sunny day  but then I can last ALL day in the blackflies and mosquitos when they are going insane .. and when the sudden squall blows in I am already prepared for it
49629,ssauvain,2007-03-20 17:21:00,77,Ok why the yellow suit....some special warding off squito properties???? Just curious....last year we went about 150 miles northeast of Ear Falls on a fly-in to Saddle Lake...it was late July and no bugs to bother us...I suppose that was just unusual???
49695,grt1,2007-03-20 19:33:00,638,"don't let those toronto guys scare you that is a great time of the year up here in the northwest. the only time when the bugs are bad is when the sun goes down and the mosquitos come to dine.  the weather will be warm and sunny, highs of 25 to 30 and lows of 10 to 15. the fish will be biting and all will be well with the world (at least the part you'll be in for the time you're there)  have a positive attitude and what can go wrong. and leave your long johns at home."
