Sounds like things are getting ready to go .. this warm weather we are having will open things up nicely .. too bad I haffta be downtown tomorrow morning ... maybe I'll sneak out afterwards
49663,easton13th,2007-03-20 18:26:00,371,Sorry to here about the camera!!!! For about $20bucks you can buy a water resistant sealed floating case @ wal-mart. Or a case that floats and makes it able to take underwater shots up to about 20 feet deep for about $150.00.  Small investment to loosing another camera and the great shots of you and the young one fishing!  Congrats on the catch!
49668,canadian_copper,2007-03-20 18:32:00,925,SAME PLACE CAMILLJ!!! THE BOARD MEMBER YOUNG ONE NOT LITTLE C LOL TX ALL
49692,just2manylures,2007-03-20 19:29:00,144,Sorry to hear about the camera.  We have all done something like that
49698,bigfish1965,2007-03-20 19:35:00,3382,They have a new digi cam from Olympus that is water proof and crush proof. Sounds like something you may need CC.
49701,ccmtcanada,2007-03-20 19:37:00,7971,I just hang the camera around my neck and leave it inside my coat so it stays nice and warm...haven't had an accident as of yet.
49707,easton13th,2007-03-20 19:43:00,371,The Olympus is a great camera....but with it's rugged durability it does still SINK..
49717,trapshooter,2007-03-20 19:57:00,1234,"Congrats on the big hen Scott.  If you are looking for a new camera, get in touch with fellow OFNCer David Chong.  He helped me out with a camera order recently.  He was very good to deal with, professional, prompt and gave a great price on the camera's we bought.  The olympus 770sw (waterproof) is a very interesting new option for fishermen.  You can completely submerge the camera and still take photo's.  I imagine this would bring the steelheading pics into a whole new ballpark."
49823,canadian_copper,2007-03-21 00:08:00,925,TX ALL!!! UNDERWATER DIGI I WOULD LOVE!!! WHAT PM ME A PRICE RANGE IF YA COULD OR GET MR CHONG TO PM PLEASE!!! TX
49829,young_one,2007-03-21 00:15:00,620,"http://www.directdial.com/ca/shop/item/prod.asp?item=DSCN2 BEST TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE CHEAPEST PRICE. I guess its not exactly for the outdoor, but still VERY NICE CAMERA! -10.1 Megapixal - Touch Screen display - etc If you want this price, you gotta hurry. Print off that page and show Future Shop the price. I believe they usually have price match. http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetai...amp;catid=24256"
49851,Canuck2fan,2007-03-21 01:05:00,1444,CC the Olympus  cameras are very interesting but I read up on them and they have a very fatal flaw. The screen apparently washes out so bad in bright sunshine that it makes the camera unusable according to hundreds of reviews. Here is the link from Futureshop for the 7.1mb version.  http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetai...4717&catid=
49853,Roy,2007-03-21 01:09:00,13728,"Thanks for the report, CC. You didn't do it in Caps so I assume it was a small stream. WTG, Bud."
