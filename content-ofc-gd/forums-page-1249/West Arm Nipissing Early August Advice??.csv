49325,carpe146,2007-03-19 22:01:00,9,"Hello All,  Thanks for the help with the last post.  We just booked for Saenchiur Flechey on the West Arm of Nipissing.  The resort looks good and it sounds like the fihing is better on the West Arm than Marten River.  Being that its our first trip up anybody have any tips for Muskies or Northerns in early August.  Also where do you guys fall lures or live bait?  Thanks Again"
49333,Andy,2007-03-19 22:18:00,330,"Use the usual stuff for pike anywhere you see weeds and you should do OK.  My son and I have had luck using crankbaits and spinnerbaits. Chartruese was a good colour a couple years ago.  That being said, you'll be into the heat of summer and warm water, so don't be surprised if you don't see a lot of bigger fish if you're mainly casting in shallower water. I haven't targetted musky there yet, but I think a search of old posts should bring up some info because there are a lot of guys with a lot of musky smarts on this board, and they are up there regularly. Beautiful area, one of my favourites.  Try get a hydrographic chart before you go...lots of rocks, structure. Andy"
49336,irishfield,2007-03-19 22:21:00,26272,I can give you a tease of where you're headin!  Hwy 64 up the right side of the pic. Lookin North  The channel between the two bridges is a nice place to get out of the wind  Looking West/NWest 
49454,love2fishhave2work,2007-03-20 02:35:00,212,"Look at the last post by irishfield.  The last picture shows a bridge.  On one side of that bridge is Lakair lodge.  Right in front of the lodge before the bridge there is a red buoy.  There is a sharp drop from a shelf from about 6 feet of water inside that buoy to 30 or so feet to wards the channel.  Fish tend to congregate there in the morning and evening and you can pick up walleye and pike by jigging as well as other stuff like catfish and rock bass. If they are not biting there, move to the other side right in the middle of the channel.  Bring leaches for walleye for that part of the season. As far as pike, there are two large bays, can't remember their name but you can pick off small pike in the weeds by casting anything shinny.  As far as Musky i think it is to early in the season."
49466,irishfield,2007-03-20 02:55:00,26272,If August is too early in the season for Musky...we're out of luck for the June OFC G2G then.. LOL  Here's a better shot of where l2fh2w is talking about. Keep in mind the navigation channel is pretty narrow there and that you can't block one with a boat...or tie up to a marker bouy.  
49472,love2fishhave2work,2007-03-20 03:20:00,212,"Thanks irishfield for pointing that out.  August is to early for the late season bite in general but does that not mean you won't catch one.  Just a less likely time of year then June or late Sept through Nov.  That said when i was fishing that area many years ago, musky's were caught in August.  Best of luck."
49762,carpe146,2007-03-20 21:30:00,9,That is a lot of good info for someone who has never seen the area before.  And if its a little too early for Musky we will probably focus on the Northerns.  As long as its big with teeth that is fine by me.  Thanks again and keep the tips coming.
49782,bassman,2007-03-20 22:05:00,384,"Nice photos, do you have any of West Nippising Resort and area?  Thanks"
49787,irishfield,2007-03-20 22:21:00,26272,Doubtful...where is it?
49857,bassman,2007-03-21 01:20:00,384,It's just a little north of where the photos were taken. It's in the town of Lavigne.  http://www.westnipissingresort.com/location.htm  Thanks
49861,irishfield,2007-03-21 01:27:00,26272,Nope...circled Lakair and then headed N/E from there....over Nippissing towards Stugeon Falls.
