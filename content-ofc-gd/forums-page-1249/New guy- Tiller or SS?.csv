49323,gotfish,2007-03-19 21:51:00,53,"I have owned and fished out of both tiller and console. I do prefer the console though for boat control in rougher water at higher speeds. I also found that you have better visability of the water you are approaching when you are that much more forward in the boat. As for space in the boat, the SC has never been a problem. AL"
49361,easton13th,2007-03-19 23:25:00,371,"Loved my tiller Love my console even more...the decision will be up to you,. Try both and get comfortable with the one you will love for years of fishing to come. Good luck"
49417,fishdawg,2007-03-20 01:16:00,912,"tiller for me as well:  16.7 & 30hp suits me fine for now -very versatile, great lakes trolling or shallow bass'n - later on sometime it'll be a 18 footer with a full console "
49434,ryanheritage,2007-03-20 01:37:00,180,wow alot of tiller guys.... I have a tiller boat and I am dying to get a nice console boat.... I saw a boat show the other day with a 14' KEY west Centre console that made get on the phone with the bank then I snapped out the dream world I was in. I am all about a nice walk around. two casting decks live well the boat is just SWEET...
49438,Mike the Pike,2007-03-20 01:58:00,3421,"Oh here we go again I started the last thread on this one.  Well yes I like my tiller for boat control ,fishing walleye trolling and having one hand free to hold my fishing rod.My previous 16ft boat had a full wrap windshield since  it was not a fishing boat it did not have alot of room.I sold that boat bought a 12 foot tinny which I used for one summer which I kept for camping.This little tiller is what made my decision when I bought my next boat.  There are times I wish I had a full wrap windshield fishing boat because I now fish from April through November.Could use that windshield in November.  If I buy another boat it won't be tiller eventhough I really enjoy the tiller control.  Having a roof would be great.After waiting all winter for opening day of fishing sometimes just having to fish in the rain becomes torcher when its only 10 degrees.So the next one will be full wrap windshield with a roof.Side console is good because you have alot of room.  I don't get tired with my tiller on a long haul maybe the reason is my boat is 18.5ft long and has the power trim.One thing for sure you can't turn sharply at high speed with a tiller or you risk losing control 50hp has a good kick to it when turning sharply at full throttle.I think when where and  time of year you fish should help you decide.If I had the money I would have both.Good Luck  "

49498,Clampet,2007-03-20 11:25:00,1947,"Isn't it more difficult to see over the bow, in a tiller, until you get up on plane? With the console, you are counterbalancing somewhat, and keeping the boat on a more level plane."
49520,Landlocked,2007-03-20 13:00:00,171,"Wow!  Thanks for all the response fellas....sure gives me lots to think about.  Hmm...so would the console be better if trying to control an ""energetic"" 2.5 yr. old son?"
49130,Landlocked,2007-03-19 15:44:00,171,"Hi everyone, Been spending some time catching up on many all of the quality posts (probably too much time!) and wanted to say what a great site this is! Just wondering what your opinions are between the tiller and SS.  The mission is to get into the water a little more this summer and looking to upgrade from my 14footer.  I won't be fishing any huge water, won't need a full windshield and won't be into any watersports. Sooo....for your basic walleye fishing, what would most recommend?  I like the wide open feel of the tillers but am wondering if the SS would be better for re-sale in the future? Thanks in advance!"
49131,PatrickGG,2007-03-19 15:47:00,562,"Welcome to the board, May the tiller vs console battle begin"
49135,Tybo,2007-03-19 15:51:00,1373,"If I didn't fish open water most of the year I would own a tiller. Since I fish when I can get out, I prefer the console. A little comfort can go a long way, when fishing in December."
49140,trapshooter,2007-03-19 16:02:00,1234,"I like a tiller for the open space.  Also, I backtroll a lot and the tiller can't be beat for that application.  Ideally though, I'd have one of each!"
49142,misfish,2007-03-19 16:05:00,29133,Dont know if I would like to hang on to a tiller if Im doing 50+ mph.LOL  Both have the pos and neg.I have lots of room to fish out of my side consol.
49143,Spiel,2007-03-19 16:07:00,9065,"....For walleye fishing, back trolling and roominess I love my tiller!  "
49150,Bernie,2007-03-19 16:17:00,3190,For those days of rain and cold and wind prefer a top and windshield. Also the top protects on those hot sunny days too. Creature comforts are nice.
49152,trapshooter,2007-03-19 16:20:00,1234,WOW!  Nice boat Spiel!
49166,lookinforwalleye,2007-03-19 16:44:00,4399,I sold my tiller last year and moved into a full windshield rig and love it the tiller was great for Walleye fishing but it was a pain in the arm hollding on to that tiller on long runs and in the spring and fall having that cold wind and the occasional ice cold lake spray hit you in the face at 50 KMH was not a alot of fun as i recall.  Full windshield for me!
49174,trapshooter,2007-03-19 16:52:00,1234,"Oh yeah, you definitely take some spray in the tiller esp. on a windy day.  If you adjust the trim properly though it shouldn't be difficult to hold on to the tiller arm.  My boat will go straight as an arrow without even touching the tiller arm.  Basically it depends what type of fishing you want to do most.  Console's definitely are better suited for some applications and the same can be said for the tiller."
49186,Terry,2007-03-19 17:03:00,14456,"I think it all depends on what you fish for  and how you fish and where you fish if you like smaller lakes, if you like slow  or back trolling weedlines/ dropoffs / shorelines for walleye triller is the way to go for open water and big water trolling, I like a steering wheel"
49196,Headhunter,2007-03-19 17:21:00,5703,Why not enjoy the best of both worlds? A console for runnin from spot to spot and a kicker to troll etc... problem solved! And the fuel savings will definately add up! HH
49207,SHAD,2007-03-19 17:49:00,134,"All tiller, no filler.  "
49213,Zib,2007-03-19 18:05:00,369,"I have a tiller & for the small lakes it's great. More room to play the bigger fish. Great for back trolling for walleye. However, making those long runs is torture on St. CLair. I'd like to upgrade to a side console as soon as I can get the wife back to work."
49216,mdej,2007-03-19 18:11:00,98,"I think it depends on the size of the boat you looking at.  I think that once you get to the 17 & 18 foot plus mark the side console is not as in the way.  On smaller it gets in the way.  Now, just to so you know, I have a 14' side console, but thats because I spend time running for ice cream and site seeing, and I have a spouse that likes to drive the boat around and not be covered in spray.  I would be very happy if my little boat was a tiller, in fact it would be great."
49221,Roy,2007-03-19 18:28:00,13728,TILLER!  
49225,OhioFisherman,2007-03-19 18:36:00,6623,The latest US study shows 96.3 percent of the old guys keep their hands on their tillers.
49231,Uncle Buck,2007-03-19 18:41:00,1000,Console...  it all comes down to personal preference though...  the higher hp tillers come with the hydraulic asist/lock
49232,aplumma,2007-03-19 18:45:00,6896,get a console life is to short to not have a cigar in one hand and a beer in the other and steering with your knee. Actually get the boat you will be happy with it sucks to be driving a beautiful boat  and wishing for something else. Just ask Roy and Spiel they both have their brave faces on saying how they like their tillers.   Art
49241,misfish,2007-03-19 19:02:00,29133," Boat????????? Nice shagg,n wheels dude"
49249,Tomcat,2007-03-19 19:22:00,395,For Spiel and Roy:  I've read/heard that most fishermen can't handle operating tillers over 60 HP. I'd appreciate comments from both of you on the validity of that statement since both of you are operating bigger tillers. I like to drive from the back too!
49254,trapshooter,2007-03-19 19:34:00,1234,"Tomcat.  At the lodge where I work at my guide boat is an 18' Lund Pro V's with 90hp yamaha tiller.  The big motors are easy to steer and hold on to at high speeds.  If I wanted to, with the trim properly adjusted, I could drive straight as an arrow with no hands on the tiller arm."
49255,misfish,2007-03-19 19:38:00,29133," YEA,BUT YER CRAZY"
49258,trapshooter,2007-03-19 19:41:00,1234,lol brian....not that I would do it... but you can.  If the trim tab is misaligned and the motor is trimed way down or up the boat will pull badly to the side.
49299,irishfield,2007-03-19 20:52:00,26272,"I don't know...I think I'll use the wheel and the hydraulic steering that goes with it    They do put a 175 Merc, with hydraulic tiller, on the 2010 Lund Pro Guide though !!!!"
