49879,krawler,2007-03-21 02:12:00,167,NArrowed down my search to a lund classic or alaskan Side console.  i was convinced on tiller for a while but recently decided on console due to the many postings and a lot of thought.  Last boat i had was a Sylvan Sea Monster 1994 and it too had a side console.  When i drove that boat the whole boat would tip on its side and id have to lean over or put some stuff on the port side to balance the weight.  Havnt been in a new boat but is still like this or are newer boats more balanced.  I weigh a healthy 240lbs.  any thoughts??  thanks

49923,pikehunter,2007-03-21 08:56:00,1659,"Then why not a centre console? Don't know about Lund but I think Crestliner, Lowe and PolarKraft make a model or two. Shouldn't be a leaning problem with them."
49924,lew,2007-03-21 09:04:00,12767,"My bro-in-law also has an older Sea Monster that leans way over to starboard , but it's a fairly narrow boat and I'd assume that's the reason.  My Crestliner is wide and doesn't lean at all when under way."
49932,mrpike,2007-03-21 10:15:00,151,Just what they said .   Just make sure.   What ever boat you go for is extra  wide.   I also have the 17 ft  lund explorer and it is a real dream of a boat .  I think it is 92 inches wide.    Best boat Ihave ever fished out of in my days on the water.  REMEMBER  DEEP WIDE AND LONG  IS BETTER.
49947,tinbanger,2007-03-21 11:49:00,1028,Bought the 1775 Classic SS last year . I'm 220lbs and the boat is solid and level when alone . You'll be happy with either choice.
