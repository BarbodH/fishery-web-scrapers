I recall having the same issue with my h20 and got it solved but for the life of me I cant remember.  The manual is not heling so Im wondering if one of you can  thanks Louis

48937,bucktail,2007-03-19 01:01:00,1857,Its been 5 months....you have to stick it in the drawer and then go to the menu and find the map in the drop down menu. Just cant rememeber what it is under now.

Select the Navionics Map you want from the drop down and hit enter.  This is from memory so it might be slightly different.  Shawn Hannah Lowrance (USA) Prostaffer"
48958,Jigatollah,2007-03-19 01:55:00,53,"Check to see if the card is a MMC or SD card. If it's a MMC card, it's a bit thinner than the SD card and won't open to read sometimes. I solved this by putting a few pieces of electrical tape on the chip that is held down by the tab inside the GPS. You will have to locate the section of map you're trying to read and install the appropriate map section as well."
48962,aniceguy,2007-03-19 02:05:00,1094,"I noticed when I go to browse the mmc files there various files are there, but in the map data section I cant seem to get them to load."
48966,Jigatollah,2007-03-19 02:33:00,53,"I had the same issue with my gps when I put in my hot maps chip for the Muskoka's. Once you locate the appropriate map in the menu, press enter and it will load up. If all else fails, Lowrance can help you out over the phone."
