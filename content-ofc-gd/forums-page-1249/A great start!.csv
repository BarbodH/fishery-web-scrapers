I figures wind out of the NE, things would be good. Wrong!! After debating on where to go, we decided to head upstream on same trib. Am I ever glad we did! Landed a small male in about 15 mins and two nice hens (7 & 4 lbs.) shortly thereafter. Besides hauling myself out of bed to go fishing, I enjoy the sights and sounds of being in the outdoors when everyone else is still in bed. It's amazing the wildlife you can see within the city/town limits of the GTA. Deer, turkeys, mink, otter, owls have all been spotted in the last month. Most people think you have to be ""up north""! Looking forward to my next outing, Cheese As soon as I figure out out to re-size my pics, I'll share a few! "
