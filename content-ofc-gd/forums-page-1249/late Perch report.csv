49133,bucktail,2007-03-19 15:50:00,1857,A late perch report from last Wednesday.  Headed out of Gilford last wednesday to enjoy some warm weather perching. Went outside of the pack and kept moving around in 20 to 25 feet of water. Everywhere we went we caught dinks. Managed 70-80 fish with only 5 keepers!!!!  Joe enjoying the sun.   The only good perch.. plus my first simcoe Herring.  Of course promptly released.    The herring     I have heard reports of more herring being caught. Hopefully they are coming back!  Going to head out later this week and hopefully get into some better fish.

Is that one of those swedish pimple jigs that you caught the herring with? Did you use that lure for the perch too?  007

49509,Terry,2007-03-20 12:29:00,14456,sounds like a lot of fun there should be no problems with the ice this week it's been cold and with the lack of snow the lake has been making ice like crazy even with the warm weather coming I would think there should be a couple more weekends of fishing on ice....but check before heading out......I could be wrong..
