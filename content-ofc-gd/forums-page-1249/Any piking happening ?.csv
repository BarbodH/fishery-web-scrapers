49627,Victor,2007-03-20 17:19:00,1609,"thanks KFTO.  Yeah it seems to be cold today, having to melt the ice on the line/guides wasn't a good experience ... and a piece of advice ... never try to melt the hook with your own mouth lol ..."
49674,MJL,2007-03-20 18:50:00,2427," Vic, don't you like the taste of salmon eggs early in the morning?  You forgot to mention, never lick a frozen reel with your tongue in winter."
49680,Victor,2007-03-20 19:02:00,1609,"haha, i figured that no one would be as smart as me to think of that idea so i didn't bother mention ...  but yeah... don't lick frozen reels, especially the aluminum spools ..."
49784,RsX,2007-03-20 22:15:00,48,island still frozen??
49799,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-20 23:07:00,1351,"im guessing yes, since the outer habour marina was still frozen, but with the warm temps of 18degrees or so wednesday and thrusday.. things might look pretty good for friday and the weekend"
48980,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-19 03:16:00,1351,Anything down at the habour area for some pike? feel free to PM me please if you don't want everyone to know. thanks!
48985,PatrickGG,2007-03-19 03:26:00,562,This week i will be attempting to do a cruise along the lakeshore hunting down them toothy critters.
48988,urbanangler1990,2007-03-19 03:37:00,933,from wednesday on looks like the pike should turn on!
48990,snag,2007-03-19 03:43:00,1932, Yup.
48993,PatrickGG,2007-03-19 03:50:00,562,"Thursday will be one of the good days we should arrange a meeting point cover more water I can't wait, anyone interested hitting the west shoreline working it to the east end?"
48995,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-19 03:54:00,1351,hmm.. sounds great.. but dammit.. im busy on wednesday and thrusday..
48998,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-19 03:55:00,1351,and piking is only till the end of this month in toronto? then back again later on.. i forgot the exact date..
49000,PatrickGG,2007-03-19 03:58:00,562,March 31 till the second sat in may its closed.
49104,eyefish,2007-03-19 14:53:00,135,if i was to go down there and fish out of a boat would I need a special pass? i heard that when fishing out there you need a harbour permit..is this true and where woudl I get one if i needed it?   Todd
49163,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-19 16:40:00,1351,yes todd you need one.. i think its from the humber to victoria park and out 1 km is the area that is considered as the toronto port area.. for more info on the permit go here http://www.torontoport.com/PortAuthority/p...rmits_intro.asp i think it is roughly $50
49192,eyefish,2007-03-19 17:13:00,135,thanks kevin
49329,ehg,2007-03-19 22:07:00,2666,"Actually the pike season re-opens in Toronto on May 5th, the first Saturday in May. So no pike fishing in Quinte or Lake Ontario and adjacent waters April 1st to May 4th.  cheers, ehg"
49334,urbanangler1990,2007-03-19 22:19:00,933," hmmm are u positive?  did they change some regs, cus im almost sure its second sat for tdot"
49345,ehg,2007-03-19 22:42:00,2666,"Always positive prior to posting. May 5th check the regs yerself in Div.8 no changes.  triple yawn, ehg"
49348,urbanangler1990,2007-03-19 22:49:00,933,maybe i was thinking of something different
49369,PatrickGG,2007-03-19 23:49:00,562,"Would the island be considered Division#4 this where the confusion sets in Lake O is div#8 but looking at the regs and the island is kinda outlined looks like it would be considered Div#4 but its on Lake O so i think its Div#8, Leslie split is Division#4 the boundary outline runs through the shore."
49388,RsX,2007-03-20 00:11:00,48,im heading out this weekend
49479,Ben_Daniels,2007-03-20 04:07:00,435,I was wat ashbridges bay lthis past weekend and caught a tiny pike. I was just getting a little axiuos for sprin and went out to take a couple cassts with a spinnerbait and got the smallest pike ever it was like 10 inches. got me even more pumped for spring.
49557,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-20 14:53:00,1351,really? i've seen people at ashbridges but never thought there really much fish there. i always went to the spits. .. maybe i'll bump into some ofncers at ashbridges or spits this friday?
49564,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-20 15:18:00,1351,alright.. screw it.. this thread got me way to excited. i'm heading out now instead...
49565,ccmtcanada,2007-03-20 15:22:00,7971, LOL...that's the spirit!! Hope to see a nice pike in a report later.....go get em!
49566,Victor,2007-03-20 15:24:00,1609,"lol kevin, good luck.  i'm planning to head out on saturday as well but i have only been to the islands before. What are some good places to try if i want to stay on the toronto side?"
49570,glirw,2007-03-20 16:03:00,200,"Victor .... pop up google maps .... pretty much ANYWHERE between ferry docks and OP is fish territory . Too many bays to name  , just walk them all!"
49582,tbayboy,2007-03-20 16:30:00,1497,Why do I picture a 3 kilometer stretch of the harbour front full of OFC hats this weekend .
49618,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-20 17:12:00,1351,"was at ashbridges for 45 mins.. way too cold, my line froze up as i reeled in.. tried some xraps and a spinner.. nothing. well better luck this weekend. also, went by the outer habour marina, still frozen.."
