49182,Squid,2007-03-19 16:57:00,1656,Should be quite a day for sure.
49248,bpsbassman,2007-03-19 19:16:00,941,"Already putting money away to line TEP & Robin's pockets. Ron, which one of them was selling the ""Cupcake Bait""? Had a chat with Gord Pyzer at BPS yesterday and he got me all wound up in anticipation of another great presentatioon by him!  I could listen to that man all day. Looking forward to meeting more of the OFC Community as well!"
