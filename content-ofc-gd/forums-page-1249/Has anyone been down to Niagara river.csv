Would the whirlpool be cleared up by now??  Also, does anyone know the site for niagara river fishing someone told me a while ago and I forgot.  Smed"

Shore ice is still very high, water is clear adn free of ice....but the fishing was extremely slow.....barely even any seagulls in the sky....means lack of baitfish!"
