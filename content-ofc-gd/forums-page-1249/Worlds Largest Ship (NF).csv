Emma Maersk operating out of the largest port in the world, Rotterdam. She is loaded by 11 cranes operating continuously. Length is almost 1/2 KM, 63 metres wide. She has a dead weight of 123,200 tons. Carries 15,000 containers. Powered by 110,000 BHP diesel and has top speed of 50KPH. Apparently a special silicon paint was applied to the hull that minimizes drag and supposedly saves 1.2 million litres of diesel fuel annually. I didn't find out how much she actually burns!          "
49571,ccmtcanada,2007-03-20 16:07:00,7971,Holy smokes!!! I'm gonna need a longer net to fish from that monster!!!  Thanks for the post...found it very interesting and cool!
49574,trapshooter,2007-03-20 16:16:00,1234,"yeah, it's nice and there's lots of room but I bet she doesn't backtroll worth a damn!"
49576,OhioFisherman,2007-03-20 16:18:00,6623,If you know the history a bit think of the labor the containers save. Most of the loading and unloading of ships required a heck of a lot more people. Stuff is already loaded on a container just put it on a frame and it`s good to go.
49648,Cast-Away,2007-03-20 18:04:00,790,"I deal with these shipping companies every day. When I log into Hapag Lloyd, they have an image section so here are a couple of pics from there.    "
49699,grt1,2007-03-20 19:36:00,638,I believe Trapshooter said it all!!!
49712,keram,2007-03-20 19:52:00,585,"Looks like center console  , do they build them in tiler version"
49715,ccmtcanada,2007-03-20 19:55:00,7971, LOL
49718,trapshooter,2007-03-20 19:58:00,1234,whoa!  if it was a tiller I could backtroll it!
49773,walleyejigger,2007-03-20 21:44:00,876,"i wonder if my ranger could tow that, what am i saying, it's a ford, it'll tow anything, just need someone to guide me while backing up at the launch,"
49774,Joey,2007-03-20 21:49:00,9122,"Holy crap, that's huge.  Paul will love those pics (not).  Half of those containers are probably on the way to the yard he works in  Joey"
49919,pikehunter,2007-03-21 08:37:00,1659,I'd have to put an addition on the garage to house it.
49941,Roy,2007-03-21 11:33:00,13728,Even a PFD would be useless on that. I would not be comfortable on that ship. I wonder if Allstate would insure that. I'm glad that thing can't make it to the Great Lakes......think of all the invasive species you could fit in a ballast that size.
