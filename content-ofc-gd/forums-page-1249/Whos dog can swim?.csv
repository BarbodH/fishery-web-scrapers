49497,Marc Thorpe,2007-03-20 11:03:00,621,"I was gonna name one of my dogs TJ,But I just could'nt see myself with a dog in my yard wearing a TUTU  So I named one of Shadow and the other Cuddles So Sandy I guess if Dax steps out of line,Shadow wont be far and he wont get no Cuddles "
49503,Terry,2007-03-20 11:53:00,14456,there was nothing wrong with the pictures ..I think clearly the dog was on the boat by choice and jumped in the water by choice and clearly she was there to get it back too shore safely......  I truly believe people who saw something bad or wrong in your post have personal problems or have something missing in their  life and should get their problems  addressed before it gets out of hand....
49550,magnum,2007-03-20 14:39:00,13,"I too saw nothing wrong with the post and appreciate the sharing of the pictures.....Thank you Jen.   My dog Laura is THE BEST swimmer.............I decided to see how good she was by swimming out in lake erie about 75-100 yards and acting like I was in trouble (this worked in the pool for her to come to me) she swam to me, circled until I grabbed her collar and pulled me to shore unassisted........The most impressive thing about that is that I am 300++lbs........   Now for you sensitive people.........she was in no danger at anytime.......it was Lake Erie and I could stand up if she needed it...............  P.S. if anyone makes a comment about my weight   ..............I will take you out on the boat and see if Laura will rescue you too  ........lol"

49447,Jen,2007-03-20 02:13:00,833,"Quote by Graftongal  Joined: 16-November 06 Member No.: 52  Sorry, but I don't think my comments were out of line. Having a pet is like parenting in a sense and everyone has different approaches, therefore I believe I am entitled to my opinion. The original comments that were posted along with the pictures were removed so that had a lot of bearing on my post.  Graftongal,  No worries, everyone is entitled to their opinion... and yours counts!  You just viewed it differently than it was intended.  Please be assured that at no time was Tucker (thats my dogs name) ever in any danger of being hurt, nor did I mean to imply that. The post was out of interest to see who has dogs that swim and who has dogs that don't. I was shocked when he stepped out of the paddle boat, as he had played on shore in the water all week. I am the parent of three children, as well as have had many pets who are members of my family. I love them very much and would never let anything happen to them I assure you. It is hard to know someone through posts... however I understand your thoughts and words in regards to animals, they were out of concern and caring. Which is why I took the humourous wording out of my post.  Cheers, Jen"
49450,Cast-Away,2007-03-20 02:18:00,790,When we got our dog the breeder told us that the best way to teach a dog to swim is to take it to a beach with a gradual slope and let the dog walk out on its own until it can't touch bottom. Most dogs will naturally start to swim and some won't. You have to work if from there. She told me that under no circumstances should you ever toss a dog off of a dock and let it learn the hard way. She said that she's seen more dogs that are scared of the water because of this method.
49462,Pigeontroller,2007-03-20 02:49:00,2793,Don't trust anyone's opinion that names their dog Dax!
49110,LeXXington,2007-03-19 15:02:00,1928,"For those who fish with me know that my dog is my best fishing partner, yeap she is a water Rat just loves the water and when its slow I toss her gently  over the side and she swim's until she is tired then comes back to the side for a pickup.. She will then stand at the side waiting to go again..  These are the pics from last year out on the Bog with Muskie Bill and John.  We were fishing a weed bed when my dog figured land.. over she went..  yes she need saving. Once back on board she looked over the side and jumped again.. this time she stayed put when I could just pick her up.      Almost all dogs can swim, its like human's panic kills."
49129,Tybo,2007-03-19 15:44:00,1373,"Use to have a white Sheppard that would dive off the dock and retrieve stones off bottom. Knew it was the same rock, because I would mark it."
49137,Puckhead,2007-03-19 15:56:00,377,I'm personally upset at the blatent disregard for the safety and well being of that drink.
