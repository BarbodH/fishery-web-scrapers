49429,dgr8t1,2007-03-20 01:32:00,15,Its been a while since i've written any postings but i was wondering if i can get some feedback on th raven float rod IM8 15' and the raven matrix float reel. I got really good deals on them at the show but i was still curious. I myself support islander float reels all the way but i just grabbed it mostly for a back up and cause i like to fall alot in the river so it has a cover. Thanks ahead for the feedback and really appreciated. thanks again and great fishing to all. cheers!
