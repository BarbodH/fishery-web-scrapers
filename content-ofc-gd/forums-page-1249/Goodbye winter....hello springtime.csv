49959,Guest mistyriver1,2007-03-21 12:20:00,0,"  You'll enjoy it. One suggestion for you since you are heading up in June...bring lots of bug spray and citronella candles.   We're actually going up towards the end of August for 2 weeks, bugs are gone.  It is one of my most favorite places.  Kevin and Leslie are top notch people.  Do yourself a favour, have a meal or two or three....in their dining room, Leslie is an amazing cook."
