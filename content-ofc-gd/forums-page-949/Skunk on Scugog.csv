I got there at about 9:30 this morning and started right off using a white spinnerbait and all i got was nothing I gave a few other baits a try but i didn't last to long out there, i then moved to the boat launch and fished right off the main dock with that same spinnerbait and i got a nice hit. After no more than a minute i got the fish to the dock and it was a wee little musky. I reached down to grab it and the fish took a quick run and cut me off.    O well i might go out there one more time this season but i think im done for trying to get bass from shore."

261943,MCTFisher9120,2008-10-26 21:36:00,3761," Nope, i reached down and just had a hold of its head but it just slipped out of my grip...the spinnerbait was in it's mouth just past the knot, the line must of broke by the teeth on the musky...it probable would of been between 14 and 18inches"

262130,limeyangler,2008-10-27 04:24:00,5204,tough luck on the wee musky...i have not even had one on my line yet!
262132,gone_fishin,2008-10-27 04:32:00,481,how the heck did a tiny little musky like that get a spinnerbait in that deep? unless it was one of those micro sized spinnerbaits...
