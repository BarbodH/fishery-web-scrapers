261149,troutologist,2008-10-24 14:04:00,951,I just got the photos from a fairly involved 2 day venture to the GWA (Greater Wawa Area)  The plan for day 1 was to go bird hunting under the guise of scouting a remote speck lake for icefishing season. Obstacles were abound during the hike.    There were some good views to be had as well.    Success!! we found the lake and it looks like a good one. I know where I'll be Jan. 2nd this year.    That portion of the trip amassed ~20km of walking and netted 2 fat partridge.  We stopped on the way north and caught a few of these characters. They were smacking gold/orange cleos on outside bends. The winds off the big lake were intense at this stop.    Day 2. We got serious about steelhead fishing. A new locale and no one around.    Caught lots of these guys...    Then eventually got a few better fish.    Til next time.    Good luck to everyone this weekend. Im heading back to catch some steelies tomorrow morning.
