262058,Greencoachdog,2008-10-27 01:19:00,8163,Was tilling out in the yard today and the rocks rattling around in the tiller shroud reminded me of this song.  
262061,jediangler,2008-10-27 01:25:00,1923,"Great song GCD, Bonham was the best, bar none. I had tickets to the Pontiac Michigan show before he drank himself to death. ""Achilles last stand"" was always my fave Zep tune."
262067,Leecher,2008-10-27 01:40:00,7832,Wish I had a tiller like that to remind me of this great song So what you planting in there now?
262077,Greencoachdog,2008-10-27 02:04:00,8163," It's a very dry, rocky, and hard piece of ground on a slope that grass won't even grow on, going to put in a little desert type garden. A few Yucca'a, some Junipers, an Oleander, and maybe a Prickly Pear Cactus or two... and whatever else Ol' Yeller tell me to plant."
262078,Leecher,2008-10-27 02:08:00,7832, Cool.... that will certaintly look good Any vegetable garden in your yard?
262080,Greencoachdog,2008-10-27 02:11:00,8163, Don't give Ol' Yeller any ideas!!!... she's already workin' me to death!!!

262116,limeyangler,2008-10-27 04:01:00,5204,  by the sounds of it GCD has been eating some of that cactus already...lol...hearing Led Zep from a tiller....trippy man
262122,Greencoachdog,2008-10-27 04:10:00,8163, HA!!! I wish I was an easy buzz like that!!! (I've brained my damage yanno  )... but the rocks rattling around in the tiller shroud really did remind me of the drum solo in the Moby Dick Led Zepplin tune... boredom can be amusing sometimes!
