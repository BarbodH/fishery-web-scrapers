261861,Mattones,2008-10-26 18:03:00,587,Any idea where i can buy a rechargeable 6 volt alkaline battery? I checked Canadian tires web site and they just have duracell 6 volt. Need it for my trail camera
261862,GbayGiant,2008-10-26 18:06:00,1780,Try future shop.
261865,tjsa,2008-10-26 18:15:00,1578,"Alkaline's are not re-chargeable as far as I know, Ni-Cad's and Lithium Ion's are. What size are you talking about, AAA, AA, C cell, D cell???? To get to six volts on your trail cam, are we talking 4 batteries???............not just one??????????"
261871,Mattones,2008-10-26 18:28:00,587,The pictire on the box looks like a soild block that says 6 volt Lantern battery  Standard or rechargable 6 volt
261873,Wild,2008-10-26 18:30:00,704,Specialized batteries? try the source or get the code and google for a place such as the battery stop.
261877,DRIFTER_016,2008-10-26 18:36:00,10439,"As far as I know, no one makes a rechargable lantern battery. You could get one of these Battery Holders and install it in place of the lantern battery and use 4 rechargable D cells."
261894,SBCregal,2008-10-26 19:21:00,688,"theres a battery shop in burlington, on fairview between walkers and guelph lines.  i believe its in the same plaza as the MTO office."
261915,Fisherman,2008-10-26 20:15:00,7201,"Radio Shack The Source has(had) them 6 volt NiCd, Total Battery should also have them."
261955,John Bacon,2008-10-26 22:12:00,3277," There are rechargable alkaline's.  I have only seen them in AA & AAA cells.  Lantern batteries (which are about 3.5x3.5"" square and about about 7"" tall) are 6 volts.  They are often used for portable fish finders.  I have never seen a rechargeable one though.  If you have a 6 volt battery that is the right size.  I don't think that it will matter if it's alkaline, NiCad, Lead Acid, or Lithium Ion.  Six volts is 6 volts.  Actually, my first choice would be Lithium Ion in terms of performance."
261971,bassjnkie,2008-10-26 22:39:00,1101,Hobby Shop should have it.
262052,Mattones,2008-10-27 01:02:00,587,Awesome I will have a look around tomorrow  thanks everyone.
262063,douG,2008-10-27 01:32:00,2693,"I took apart a dead Duracell 6 V lantern battery, and inside I found 6 perfectly good Duracell D cells, it was the cheap foil and cardboard connections at top and bottom which had failed.  I know this isn't relevant, but what the hey."
262071,Dabluz,2008-10-27 01:47:00,701,"You can buy rechargeable batteries in stores that sell security clothes, hardhats, goggles, steel toed boots etc.  They have 6 and 12 volt rechargeable batteries for emergency lighting systems.  Alkaline batteries are not really rechargeable.  Yes, you can put some alkaline batteries in a special charger and recharge them a bit but this must be done before the battery is dead and the fix is temporary."
