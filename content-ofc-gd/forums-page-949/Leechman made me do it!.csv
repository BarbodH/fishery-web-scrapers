262040,fishindevil,2008-10-27 00:41:00,6254,"Well i think you should install a lake camera down at your shoreline so we can keep an eye on things,that way leechman can tell you when you can go fishing,after he does all the weather checks first !!!!.  .lol..lol..lol.cheers bud,looks like you have a very nice place up there in the great white north !!!"
