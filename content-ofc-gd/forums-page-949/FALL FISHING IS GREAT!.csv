261089,limeyangler,2008-10-24 03:00:00,5204,"Hi Y'all,  This time last year my boat had been in the garage for at least 3 weeks, i kinda figured that because i had not had much success on the lake i live on, fishing everywhere was similar. Well one year later with lots more knowledge (lots gratefully gleened from the pages of this forum), and my own truck to pull the boat on...which helps, i am discovering the whole new season of fall...fishing wise.........and it ROCKS....cold....but WHO CARES!  I had been busy all day getting the house/garage/woodpile etc...ready for winter and had decided early on in the day(lol...the moment i got up) that i would make do with a couple of hours at the end of the yard casting frm shore. I was done at about 2pm, and thought i could easily do better than the yard and head off for the evening bite at Beaver lake, again. So i hooked the trailer up, drove to town, picked up minnows for today(and tomorrow as we are heading to Lac Seul at 4:30am) did some quick repairs to my trailer lights in the car park of canadian Tire, and was on Beaver Lake by 3pm.   Like the time i was there last i headed to the 'honey hole' we have discovered there. For the firsat hour i did not even get a bite. Then i started to catch the usual jackfish.....and another, and another....strangely all the exact same size...and lol....no....its not the same fish over and over in the pics below.....    AFTER 1 HOUR ALL I STARTED TO CATCH WAS JACKFISH                  I must have caught around 10 of those little guys before it went quiet for around half an hour. This time, unlike the last time i did not move off the honeyhole, i was sure the walleye were there, and at around 5pm ish i hooked into the first one. From 5pm till dark the bite just got better and better. All the fish were between 18"" and 24""...really fat, and feisty, must have caught around 20 fish, all in 12 FOW, water temp now at 47F, most on a small chartreuse jig, some near the ned on slip bobber with orange /white jig...minnows for bait. I did not keep any as i could not get any smaller ones, and being a small lake i put 'em back to breed more little wallaces   Here's some piccys and videos of a really enjoyable and successful hour and a half walleye bonanza....sorry bout the sound on the vids.                    <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/gg-1.flv"">                  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/jj-1.flv"">                   <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/ll-1.flv"">                 <object width=""425"" height=""344""><param name=""movie"" value=""              Hopefully tomorrows outing on lac seul is as rewarding, but hey....i dont care...its just great to get out there."

261098,jwl,2008-10-24 04:19:00,1056,"excellent stuff..you are absolutely right..fall fishin is great!!!!  Nice fish you got into for sure.  You gotta love it, I have been waiting for this time of eyar since last fall/winter...some of the best fishing ever happens this time of year..great pike action,musky action, feedbag bass and walleye, and other species become more prevolent as it gets cold out there, like big steelies.lakers,and browns.   I am really looking forward to this cold weather fishing season, as a matter of fact I just sorted through all my fishin stuff and tidied up the boat today to sort through everything and put away the stuff I don't need for the fall/winter, and gear up with the stuff I will use.  Thanks for sharing the report, I think I can smell the pike snot from here"
