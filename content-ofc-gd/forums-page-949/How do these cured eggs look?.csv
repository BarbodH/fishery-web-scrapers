261306,solopaddler,2008-10-24 21:26:00,8605,Horrible! I think you should send it by courier to my place so I can dispose of it properly.
261307,ccmtcanada,2008-10-24 21:28:00,7971,Looks like a trout wants to eat 'em....good job...tie 'em up and fish!
261319,chickenhawk,2008-10-24 22:06:00,612,is that all salt? if it is i dont use that much but it'll work nonetheless i would say there is no right or wrong way to do it.....maybe try washing them out a bit to get rid of that excess salt....anyways good luck on the river   Hawk
261322,misfish,2008-10-24 22:15:00,29133,"Well to me thier a bit too yellow. Give a couple of table spoons of brown sugar to them, (mix in with your fingers)then you got it."
261331,jwl,2008-10-24 22:32:00,1056,umm..poached  don't be shy about trying to dye some in different colours
261336,misfish,2008-10-24 22:38:00,29133," Funny you mention that jwl. Give some beet juice a try. Yep,boil some beats (yes boil) the stuff in the jar dosent work the same. You need the temp. to make it work, and then pour the left over juice over some eggs in a bowl. Best I ever had fishing for browns down your way."
261337,jrego7,2008-10-24 22:47:00,37,its borax and knox gelatin i tried out angies cure.
261368,silvio,2008-10-25 00:24:00,433,There fine to me roll them around in paper towel to get some off and then go fishing.
261375,Beans,2008-10-25 00:34:00,3339,Looks like coloured tapioca to me...
261376,misfish,2008-10-25 00:38:00,29133,
261381,ccmtcanada,2008-10-25 00:56:00,7971, I use the same cure formula with salmon roe....it's works great...so much so that I no longer keep trout for roe.
261429,jrego7,2008-10-25 04:04:00,37,I was reading the box and borax is a deoderizer... Why would it be used in a cure? Or is angies cure a scam? lol... The eggs I bought at the bait shop didn't seem to be cured at all. Seems like they were dipped in water until their shell was thickened and then dried a bit and frozen.
261431,silvio,2008-10-25 04:17:00,433,Raps your store eggs were cured donâ€™t kid yourself. Your eggs are fine be confident in you presentation and the rewards will be endless.
261448,solopaddler,2008-10-25 11:18:00,8605, Borax alone has been used for eons as a cure. Almost every single commercial cure available is borax based. It works fabulous (if you like to cure your eggs).  A huge box of borax from the supermarket is a lot cheaper than buying any commercial cure and just as effective.
261478,modny,2008-10-25 14:40:00,502,pour some milk in that bowl and u got breakfast son
261482,Rich,2008-10-25 14:43:00,3927,"I prefer to just freeze the fresh eggs and tie as necessary, but I'm sure that'll work great for ya. Like others said, it's more of a confidence thing. Personally I have no confidence in anything borax cured, not sure why but it just doesn't seem to work for me.. but I know others that do well.  I've done good things with a brown sugar/salt cure in the past."
261610,fishnpro,2008-10-25 23:14:00,93,Can you do this with loose eggs? I read on another website that they eggs have to be in the skien still and I want to make a batch of it tonight but dont want to use a whole skien the first time I try it. Anyone?
261636,Rich,2008-10-26 00:05:00,3927,Those are loose eggs in the pic...
261645,misfish,2008-10-26 00:19:00,29133," You can spoon or use your fingers, to pull the eggs from the skien.As long as it,s not really tight."
