261013,muskyhunter5150,2008-10-23 23:02:00,64,"Just wondering if any one has had any experience with the shimano convergence musky rods. Thinking of buying one but want to hear some of your opinions before I go buy it.   Thanks, Josh"
261018,Wild,2008-10-23 23:22:00,704,Josh you are much better off to buy the Compre.
261019,Roy,2008-10-23 23:33:00,13728,"For muskie, I would go Compre as well. The Convergence is available in a muskie casting model but I haven't tried it. For the price, I might be tempted to try it."
261020,danbo,2008-10-23 23:35:00,2646,check our classifieds first..     or Buy St.Croix!!
261050,darsky,2008-10-24 01:15:00,586,I have both.Line them up side by side and there is almost NO difference-except about 45.00
261053,cowanjo,2008-10-24 01:20:00,249,"Hey Josh - I fish pigeon, little bald and Big bald lake,. i have a 7'2 XH (more like 7'6). i have it with an ABU garcia 7000c (Couldnt give up my old reel! great with big fish). This one is good for the money - there are some excellent deals around now The Pete Mania Series are unvbelievable value and awesome  good luck"
261065,muskyhunter5150,2008-10-24 01:59:00,64,Thanks everyone for there replys. I was thinking about getting the Compre but i only have 110 to spend and i think it's like 140 at the store i usally go to. So i think I'll grab the convergence and see how it works.
261084,muskymike,2008-10-24 02:51:00,772,you should be able to pick up a compre for 110 or 115 without a problem.  JB's has them for $115 for sure
261088,muskyhunter5150,2008-10-24 02:57:00,64,  O.k I didn't know that thanks alot for telling me that. Ill grab it then.
261093,cram,2008-10-24 03:10:00,1733, weird....i stopped by JB's the other day to check out their musky baits and thought everything was over-priced.
261117,Wild,2008-10-24 12:04:00,704,Compared to who Cram?
261120,mattyk,2008-10-24 12:39:00,2110,go with the Compre.
261121,johnnyb,2008-10-24 12:41:00,3413,Compre compre compre
261126,lew,2008-10-24 12:46:00,12767,"I'm also a Compre fan and much prefer them over the St. Croix musky rods, infact I've sold off most of my St. Croix's and am gradually replacing them all with Compres."
261128,lookinforwalleye,2008-10-24 13:10:00,4399," I have Compre`s and have no complaints, as a side bar I have a Pete Mania musky rod collecting dust PM me if your interested."
261132,Wild,2008-10-24 13:15:00,704," There is a difference in the details between IM-8 and IM-6 blanks plus if you look at the warranty Compre  limited lifetime, Convergence is 1 year plus which guides will wear out quicker? Compre is the better value."
261133,danbo,2008-10-24 13:20:00,2646,I wouldn't even wear a shimano hat..  Berkley Tactix is a bargain as well.
261152,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-10-24 14:10:00,1362,"Josh,  I have the Compre CPC-M70MF and the Convergence CVC-F70H......Both are great rods...they are 1 piece rods and have been put to a lot of use!!....the Convergence was ~$85 and the Compre ~ $119  Steve"
261857,Guest steel'n'esox,2008-10-26 17:32:00,0,"Go with the compres, your in peterborough and so is the warranty centre, they have a lifetime warranty and stand by their products, as Im sure others do as well, but you most likely will have no down time if something bad should happen, and no shipping and handling charges etc."
