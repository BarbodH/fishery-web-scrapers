I have one rod set up with a bass jig that has been the most productive bait so far this fall, but i have my 6'6 medium action spinning setup that needs to have something tied to it. I know next to nothing about fall patterns and working lures and soft plastics. The areas i fish use to be extremely weedy but now many of these weeds have died off. My only ideas is to use a texas rigged yum creature bait (blue) with a slip sinker. Thanks for any help   Mike"
