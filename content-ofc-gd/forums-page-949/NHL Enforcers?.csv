261352,danc,2008-10-24 23:45:00,4677," HAH!! I've seen more people get hurt at a church picnic than at a Domi fight. Sure, He'd take on anyone. But his skill was in keeping distance from his foe. Wendell would eat him alive."
261356,sturgman,2008-10-24 23:57:00,249,  I believe Willie Plett was in the same boat...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNUyufQ2s-U
261454,solopaddler,2008-10-25 12:29:00,8605,The paid enforcers that have been mentioned are an easy choice. I'll agree with Larry Robinson and Cam Neely as well. Robinson didn't fight a lot but when he did he pulverized his opponents. Same with Neely. Both are hall of famers to boot. How about Al Secord? He was another tough dude who could play.
261613,Scott S,2008-10-25 23:18:00,203,"Chris Neil from Ottawa can do everything, fight,score and turn the game around with a big hit. I played hockey with his older brothers and watched him through junior all the way to the NHL."
261640,NAC,2008-10-26 00:10:00,369,"As far as enforcers go in my time, I'd have to say Bob Probert stood as tall as any. I'm not so certain that Cam Neely being the best two-way player ever, couldn't have taken Probert in the odd tussle.?"
261644,Greencoachdog,2008-10-26 00:18:00,8163,"Being a Redneck from the Southeastern U.S., I just gotta ask... is that really a frozen Moose turd they're batting around on the ice with those curved Willow branches???  A Hoser named McKenzie from Alberta told me it was..."
261751,lunkerbasshunter,2008-10-26 13:02:00,2585,i agree 100% with sturgmen there has not been a fighter as quit and as accurate and that could punch as hard as clark since him.  Cheers!
262007,holdfast,2008-10-26 23:42:00,1813,I remember this fight Way back.  Next day the newspaper read.  THE HAMMER GETS NAILED BY ROBINSON  
262032,kuhaman,2008-10-27 00:18:00,503,
262073,Fang,2008-10-27 01:55:00,1330,I only have guys that could actually play on my top list and these never had to drop the gloves more than once  Larry Robinson Clark Gilles  and if you actually think Sean Avery is tuff look what Stumpy Thomas did to him  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHy0ebNK9Y  Avery never dropped his gloves with anyone who could go!
261066,Rizzo,2008-10-24 02:00:00,4754, I remember the outcry when Kordic was given #27 because of some of the great players (see above) who had worn it before. Kordic wearing that number was even worse than Wilf Paiement donning #99...although that was ill-advised as well

261094,jediangler,2008-10-24 03:15:00,1923,"Cam Neely. He could do everything Wendy could do but better. That's why he's in the ""Hall of Fame"" and Wendy is not."
261095,holdfast,2008-10-24 03:23:00,1813,"Yea I agree, I forgot about Cam Neely.  Jerome Iginla kind of reminds me of the same type player.  To Bad Goof Samulson kee'd Neely in the prime of his career."
261118,snoil,2008-10-24 12:08:00,139,In directly someone said it Gordie Howe.Nobody would fight the man. Loved Tiger with that nose he could bite a wall!
261122,anders,2008-10-24 12:41:00,1168,"   And just for arguements sake...i will also throw out my home town boy...Chris Simon.  Better believe if Simon was in the NHL today, Hollweg wouldnt have had 2 suspensions today..he would be watching over his shoulder all the time."
261151,maurizio,2008-10-24 14:08:00,10,Can't forget this great Fight!  http://www.break.com/index/the-worst-fight...ey-history.html
261167,Headhunter,2008-10-24 14:45:00,5703,Probert... the man was a machine! HH
261171,BillM,2008-10-24 15:17:00,17367,"There are all kinds..  What about Semenko? Grimson? Kocher? Baumgartner? Dave Brown?  Lots of great fighters out there, although if I had to pin one down, I'd honestly have to say Probert. (Even though I'm a Leafs fan)"
261188,mpt,2008-10-24 16:08:00,158,Ferguson or Howe. Nobody would fight Gordie. I remember Fergie flipping ice chips over the boards on Grapes in the pre-game. Cherry just kept his mouth shut so that should be enough testament.
261189,blaque,2008-10-24 16:09:00,2419," Dude i gotta give it to ya for ""Best 1st post"" That was literally the funniest thing i have seen in a LONG time!!!!!"
261192,glen,2008-10-24 16:22:00,2641,That was so funny. The worst fight is way better then the best fight.    :clapping:
261193,glen,2008-10-24 16:24:00,2641,Fish-Nymph gets my vote for top scout.
261204,bigugli,2008-10-24 17:17:00,6138,The entire lineup of the Philadelphia goon squad.  They were busy keeping Bobby Clark from getting beat up.
261206,jediangler,2008-10-24 17:23:00,1923,I forgot about McSorley. I laugh everytime I see that clip of him clubbing Brashear in the side of the head with his stick. Nobody deserved it more.
261215,Pondo,2008-10-24 17:40:00,36,"Frank ""The Animal"" Bialowas.  Only 4 games actually played in The Show but he was an AHL legend and smacked around all comers.  Other tough guys were literally terrified of Frank.  Google him for proof."
261218,BillM,2008-10-24 17:45:00,17367,"  LOL Bialowas..  To bad when they brought him up to the Leafs, his bud Ken McRae stole the show   ( I am sure you remember the fight McRae had against Bob Bassen.)"
261234,Domi Fish,2008-10-24 18:20:00,46,"Here's my top 5 fighters of all-time..  Bob Probert Dave Brown Behn Wilson Joey Kocur Bobby Nystrom  Honorable mention goes out to...Domi, Larry Playfair, Nick Fotiu, John Wensink, Tony Twist"
261238,Stoty,2008-10-24 18:29:00,2910," HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH  Ah geesh, thanks for the laugh today. I needed that."
261272,F7Firecat,2008-10-24 19:58:00,347,Heres some vintage Probert  I especially like  the one where Wendell is hugging his leg lol  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCZEMSsGWYU
261284,wallyboss,2008-10-24 20:29:00,1095,"Can't believe nobody said  Dale Hunter.  Dave Semenko , Ken Linesman.  John Kordik  Domi was a good fighter but I can't believe that some would put Wendell Clark on this list of enforcers!!!!"
261334,holdfast,2008-10-24 22:35:00,1813, Do you know that Fergie never put skates on till he was 16
261339,Rizzo,2008-10-24 23:12:00,4754,the missing link...Link Gaetz
261349,danbo,2008-10-24 23:35:00,2646,Dan Maloney cracked a few skulls in his day. Larry Robinson too! Denis Potvin was a rough & ready allstar.
261350,Weeds,2008-10-24 23:43:00,782,Rob Ray.   All part of the game.

260978,fishnpro,2008-10-23 21:22:00,93,"totally have to agree with sturgman, Wendel was the man."
260980,sturgman,2008-10-23 21:24:00,249,Wendel Clark made me a man!!
260981,MCTFisher9120,2008-10-23 21:28:00,3761,"Tie Domi!  He played 1020 games, had 104 goals, 141 assists and had 3515 penalty minutes, not to mention 83 fights."
260982,danbo,2008-10-23 21:33:00,2646,"  John Ferguson,Bob Probert, there were many!!   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rH9wKQPoH0  Tie Domi.."
260989,holdfast,2008-10-23 22:04:00,1813," Wrong O hes either a Russian or Swede, from either Ottawa or Mtl,  Seriously though, Terry O'Reilly, John Ferguson ( never seen him lose,Broke Bobby Hulls Jaw that had to be wired, Knocked out Eric Nesterenko that was key for Mtl winning the cup against Chicago my Pops stated) Probert, Chris Nylund.  Saw little Stan Johnathen beat up big Pete Mahovalich. It was funny looking."
260990,holdfast,2008-10-23 22:06:00,1813, WoW disregard my last about Probert.
260995,misfish,2008-10-23 22:15:00,29133, I cant believe I just read that about Wendy.LOL

261011,Rizzo,2008-10-23 23:01:00,4754,greatest Leaf to ever wear #27...the late great Johnny Kordic
261015,chickenhawk,2008-10-23 23:07:00,612,well i'll tell ya they don't get much tougher than sean avery! lmao i love that guy tho!
261017,danbo,2008-10-23 23:10:00,2646,"Kordic was rough but ""The Big M"" owns that # 27 Brother Rizzo! (Mr. Darryl Sittler wore it Proudly too !!)"
261023,Leecher,2008-10-24 00:01:00,7832,And what about George Laraque    Best fighter in NHL today  
261024,Grimace,2008-10-24 00:01:00,2020,Wendall Clark.        Wasn't gay either.    When he broke up with his old lady he crashed at Glen Anderson's place for a couple of weeks.   That is when the rumours started.    Complete nonsense.  Gotta hand to Probert.   He was great as well.
261025,forrest,2008-10-24 00:01:00,1032,This should have been an easy one for Leaf supporters over 35:  Tiger Williams  3966PM is a record that has stood the test of time
261026,Photoz,2008-10-24 00:02:00,792,Lou Fontinato . . . .    from way y y y  y   y back when they played REAL hockey. The only guy to ever whup 'im was Gordie Howe!
261028,Grimace,2008-10-24 00:06:00,2020,"A buddy of mine use to have a ""Give blood ---  Fight Probert"" T shirt.   Anyone remember those shirts?"
261032,kennyman,2008-10-24 00:11:00,737,"I'd say my favorite is Wendall,he could do it all ............  but Probert may be the toughest over the years I have watched. Now, Boogard may have the the best single punch. I wouldn't want to get hit by ""the boogie man""."
261034,snag,2008-10-24 00:18:00,1932, Ya beat me to it!  He was a mean dude.  He had  messed up face near the end that would turn your blood cold!
261035,Daplumma,2008-10-24 00:23:00,1961,"Not the biggest or the best but he came alive around playoff time down here in the 80,s...Lou Franceschetti.I saw him start a fight before the puck dropped one year.Its what he was paid for. Joe"
