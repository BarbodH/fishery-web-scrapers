261676,PERCHER,2008-10-26 01:20:00,787,Well the weather wasn't really all that bad .The winds were about 35khm  but the rain would not stop.By the end of the day we were soaked to the skin.We ended going from Picton to the gap.After about 4 or 5 hours of trolling back using the kicker to push us and the bow mount to keep us going in the right direction Mike ended up with 9-10 lbe'r.At times the rain was so hard it was blinding.Put it all paid off in the long run.Mike will post some pictures of his catch later .At the end of the day we ended up meeting up with Memart Terry and Loyd and I believe it was john .It was nice seeing you guys and I am sure we will all meet up again in 3 weeks. Dan
