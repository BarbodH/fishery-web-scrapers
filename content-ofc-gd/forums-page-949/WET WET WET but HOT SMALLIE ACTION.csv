Could the WM be wrong? Started drifting and dragging tubes in 8-12 ft of rocky bottom and only hooking up with small ones. Changed location and depth slightly and on came the fish and ON CAME THE RAIN. Both were non stop for the whole day. My 40.00 Wetskins suit from Crappie Tire was actually holding up better than my partners 560.00 Cabelas Guide Wear suit.He was not too happy about that. Drift and drag gave way to cast and rip as we stayed mainly in hard bottom/weed/rock areas. Not the easiest of fishing style as bites (or that famous smallie tick) can be very hard to detect.But once you are accustomed to it-no problemmos. After about 50-60 smallies later up to 4 lbs and a few pike and walleyes-we called it a wet but successful day."

I never had any luck with those cheap wet skins, they always rip...but i got a good jacket(cheap) and a pair of cheaper black waterproof skin trouers, with plenty of give....and i spray them with that waterproofing sparay...the water just beads of it."
