261875,GbayGiant,2008-10-26 18:36:00,1780,"Got this in the spring trolling Georgian Bay for walleye with a worm harness, I've never caught a white perch or a white bass so had no idea, googled it and seems to be a White Perch ?  Anyone else catch white perch anywhere ? don't see them around to much on the bay.   "
261885,Greencoachdog,2008-10-26 18:51:00,8163,"Yup! White Perch... and a darn fine specimen too!!!  They are a Temperate Bass like White Bass and Stripers, a nomadic schooling fish."
261886,fishermccann,2008-10-26 18:54:00,655,"Yes I have caught them out of Lake Ontario, at the mouth of the Rouge River."
261896,ehg,2008-10-26 19:23:00,2666,That fish is a 'white perch' GBayGiant. Notice it has a perch like face and no stripes. The white bass has a different mouth and striping like this one. 
261900,Bernie,2008-10-26 19:33:00,3190,That is interesting GB. Didn't know they existed. Wonder if they ever have been caught in Nipissing?
261920,GbayGiant,2008-10-26 20:27:00,1780,"GCD, Stripers are one fish I wish the bay did have, they look like a good fish to catch.  Nice fish EHG, yeah when I got it I noticed the perch head and than the body looked like a crappie but I herd of guys getting white bass up here too so wasn't sure but I can see the difference now.  I would guess Nipissing has them, they got everything else from the Bay and have herd of guys getting lots of White Bass there."
261923,misfish,2008-10-26 20:51:00,29133,"Your pic of the fish,I was always under the impression they were white bass,til Spiel told me other wise."
261995,Greencoachdog,2008-10-26 23:27:00,8163,Here's an interesting link to Temperate Bass in the Great Lakes: http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/seagrant/GLWL/Fish/bass/bass.html
262006,Tdel,2008-10-26 23:40:00,393,"I have caught white perch near the coal dock in Midland (Severn Sound, Georgian Bay).  When I caught the White Perch at first I thought it was a small Silver Bass (White Bass) but the colours weren't right.  The White Perch was silver with a yellowish tint.  It was without the definite black horizontal stripes on the sides.  Silver Bass are exactly that ..... very bright and silver with the dark horizontal stripes, they have no yellow tint at all.  Tom"
