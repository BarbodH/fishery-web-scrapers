The five of us that turned out hussled and did what we could.  We did not make it up as far as the willow hole this year as we only had one in waders but we did pull out a lot of garbage.  Much thanks to Kory (the picture taker), Chris, Victor, and Noel!!  For those of you that did not show up please take a bag in with you every time you fish and bring out a bit extra when your day is done.  If we all do this regularly, we can eliminate the need for official clean-ups altogether.    Kevin"
261540,Joey,2008-10-25 19:55:00,9122,Good on you guys for doing that.  My hat goes off to you  Joey
261545,johnnyb,2008-10-25 20:03:00,3413,"Wow -- that's really impressive.  I would have thought that in a town so dedicated to appearances and useable green-space, more people would have come out to clean up a park that is as nice as that one. Tried to get away for a bit, but the boss wouldn't let me!  At work...not the boss at home  GREAT JOB GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
