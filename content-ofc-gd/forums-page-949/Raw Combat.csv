261559,Governator,2008-10-25 20:35:00,879,The guy your brother is fighting looks massive... gl
261568,steverowbotham,2008-10-25 21:12:00,1800,"Yeah he's a big guy, its upper body mass.  Itty bitty legs on him haha. Mike has a good gameplan going into the fight and is very confident.  Not that you can use previous fights to determine a fight.  But both of their last fights were against the same opponent.  Mike Rowbotham defeats Mike Zvonick by Submission (armbar) at 2:14 of Round 1  Keto Allen defeats Mike Zvonick by TKO at 2:40 of Round 3.  It's a confidence thing knowing you finished the same guy 10 minutes sooner."
261579,Beats,2008-10-25 21:45:00,543,I always think it's funny that there is only one pose those guys do in every single shot of them.  They must get tired of holding their arms like that every time someone points a camera at them
261584,misfish,2008-10-25 21:52:00,29133,"Steve I agree,but HEART,has alot to do with it also. Your getting pounded,can you suck it up and get back into the game. Only to the girls , SIZE matter."
261596,danc,2008-10-25 22:22:00,4677,Good luck to your brother Mike tonight Steve. My buddy Nathan Gunn is also on the card. Are these events ever televised?
261599,misfish,2008-10-25 22:34:00,29133,Dan I catch them the odd time on Spike. But way later after the event.
261603,kentooley,2008-10-25 22:54:00,208,I'm a Christian ...and I will pray for your brother to slap the other guy like the carp that he is.
261714,sharper,2008-10-26 04:07:00,279,So how did he do?
261739,Terry,2008-10-26 12:13:00,14456,RAW COMBAT RESULTS Keto Allen def. Mike Rowbotham by submission due to strikes (liver kick) in Round 2 Matt Bagshaw def.

261760,danc,2008-10-26 13:28:00,4677,"Thanks for the results Terry. Too bad that Mike lost, but I'm sure that he'll bounce back. Surely a ""liver kick"" is enough to take anyone down.  I see that my buddy Nathan ""The Machiiiinnnnnnne"" Gunn (that's what I call him   ) won yet again. I think that he's 6-0 now. I think that this is his first fight that went the distance as well. He just keeps on flying to Calgary and kicking the crap out of whoever they put up against him. If you ever had the chance to look Nathan in the eye, you'd know right then and there that you wouldn't want to fight him. The guy is tough as nails. I had a talk with Nathan earlier this summer about his future plans in the sport. He told me that he got into the sport too late, and that his age is not on his side. He's in his early 30's now. So his plans are to just keep going until he wears out. It has to be tough to stay competitive in that sport while maintaining a full time job outside of the sport. Watch for his name in upcoming events. The kid is mean."
261807,steverowbotham,2008-10-26 15:06:00,1800,"Mike trained with Nate in Thunder Bay for a while, hes a phenominal fighter.  Mike did really well in his fight, he had the guy mounted and was punishing him from the top, then went for an armbar and missed it, went for submissions from his back for the last 2 minutes of round 1.  About 1:30 into round 2, he ate a kick to the liver that visually hurt him. He tried to continue but was forced to tap out due to strikes.  When I talked to him after he said he tapped because he was too worried about covering his liver than covering his face.  I'll add pics later, on my way to Banff now!!"
