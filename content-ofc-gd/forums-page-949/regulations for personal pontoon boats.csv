261787,forrest,2008-10-26 14:21:00,1032,I have heard of people getting tickets in paddle boats so I have to ask.  What regulations are there for those small pontoon boats that one uses flippers or oars to propel?  With and without motor.    forrest
261791,DRIFTER_016,2008-10-26 14:32:00,10439," My guess is the same as any other small craft, i.e. canoe, kayak etc. Make sure you have the proper safety equipment and you'll be fine.  From the Canadian Boating Regs:  Unpowered Craft up to 6 metres in length (19'8"")  1 approved and properly sized lifejacket (yellow, red or orange) or PFD (personal floatation device) for each person on board 1 buoyant heaving 15 metres one manual propelling device OR an anchor with 15 m (50') of cable, rope or chain one Class 5BC fire extinguisher, if equipped with an inboard engine, a fixed fuel tank, or a fuelburning stove, fridge or heater. 1 hand-bailer OR manual pump with enough hose to pump water overboard [Not required for any self-bailing sealed hull sailboat that cannot contain enough water to make the vessel capsize OR a multi-hull vessel that has subdivided multiple-sealed hull construction.] Sound signalling device Navigation lights must comply with Collision Regulations [Not required unless operated at night or in restricted visibility.]"

261819,DANIMAL,2008-10-26 15:23:00,215,I'm pretty sure you can be charged for drinking and boating the same as if you were in a larger motorized boat.
261850,jwl,2008-10-26 17:09:00,1056,"at my trailer,the kids often get to use a couple different neighbours paddle boats if they want..and yeeper they have to grab one of the safety kits I have for out boats..fortunately I have a couple...the kids also use my old 12 footer for a row boat...same deal goes..lifejackets on at all times too"
261924,JohnF,2008-10-26 20:54:00,3494, Jeez. All that crap would sink a kayak.  JF
262049,skeeter,2008-10-27 00:56:00,1907,all you need is that orange safety kit from walmart--$8.96 and the life jacket flippers are your manual propelling device now your good to go.
