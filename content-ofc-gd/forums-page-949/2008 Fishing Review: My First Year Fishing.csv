261264,mistyriver1,2008-10-24 19:49:00,600,Great post.  You can hear this enthusiasm in your writing.   Jim
261289,ccmtcanada,2008-10-24 20:45:00,7971, Keep at it Governator...Bly and I only started fishing 2 years ago.  You have the right attitude and thirst for knowledge to succeed!  This board has helped immensely....a wealth of information.  We wouldn't have done nearly as well in the past 2 years if it wasn't for OFC.  I deserve no credit by the way....you caught the fish!! LOL.  My advice was more preventative in nature....I still have a scar from a pike....but it's a great reminder of the fish....kinda like war wounds....haha.
261519,ehg,2008-10-25 17:33:00,2666,"What a great effort just writing this report  You live in an area with many fishing oppurtunities, within a few minutes to an hours drive. Keep up your passion for the sport, it is a great way to spend free time. Buy a portable depth finder and a slightly bigger boat/ trailer fror cheap and you will do even better.  Thanks for sharing this story  Cheers, ehg"
261583,Rich,2008-10-25 21:51:00,3927,"That's awesome dude, I'd say you had a great first season of fishing. I'm sure you'll enjoy many, many more to come! And as the experience goes up, the general size of the catch does too. I'm sure we'll see quite a few ""new PB"" reports from you in the near future."
260944,bassjnkie,2008-10-23 17:38:00,1101,"Great report, nice fish!! WTG!!"
260948,SlowPoke,2008-10-23 17:47:00,2984,Great report Gov but the really good fishing has just started! Don't put the long rods away just yet!  -Brian
260957,John,2008-10-23 18:42:00,2956,"Thanks for sharing your first year, I hope that you have become hopelessly addicted."
260985,johnnyb,2008-10-23 21:51:00,3413,"I've only skimmed over this, as I'm at work, but you can see the progression of your skills over the summer -- way to go, and thanks for sharing!!!"
260992,Raf,2008-10-23 22:07:00,3495,good on you and your buddy for just getting out there and doing it.  can't do much surfing the couch.   sounds like you're both hooked.  for the sake of your wallets and sanity i hope you don't hook into a muskie any time soon.
260998,MCTFisher9120,2008-10-23 22:24:00,3761,"that was a long read. Good report, you covered a long time  Again with the progression with your skills, you do better than most people do their first year of fishing. Congradulations on a good year  and thanks for sharing!"
261016,Moosebunk,2008-10-23 23:08:00,3970,Thoroughly enjoyed this Governator.  Good for you and your bud for getting out there and making a good start of what should be a lifelong enjoyable passion to fish.
261047,Leecher,2008-10-24 00:58:00,7832,Great report and pics Governator  Congratulation on your PB     That's a real nice bucket Keep it up and thanks for sharing Leechman
261052,Muskieman,2008-10-24 01:20:00,2472,   GREAT READ!!!...............That report belongs in the pages of In-Fisherman......Ontario Out Of Doors........  I hope that your now an addict..........  My wife has yet to find a Fishing-Rehab ..  Be safe in that Zodiac  :Gonefishing:   RFS
261055,limeyangler,2008-10-24 01:31:00,5204,"Really fun read, thanks for sharing. I hope you dont do the 'snow day' thing all winter again.....GET A SNOWMACHINE.....YOUR BUDDY ALREADY HAS AN ICE ROD......GO DRILL SOME HOLES THIS WINTER!!!! Once again, fun read....thanks."
261059,ctdd2006,2008-10-24 01:46:00,531,"A very fun read!  Congrats to the two of you!  I know it has already been said, but don't put the rods away yet!  There is lots of time still to land those toothy critters you like."
261083,sharper,2008-10-24 02:49:00,279,Awesome report! You guys can still get some more fishing in before hard water. I know i'll
261097,Governator,2008-10-24 03:58:00,879,"Wow.. seriously guys thanks very much for the compliments!     I'm excited and afraid of that day at the same time.    Thanks, we really tried to make it a serious goal to get out more.  We're both web developers and sit on our ass all day.  Getting out literally means getting out.    Hahaha.. Thanks that's quite the compliment and yes I think it's safe to call us addicts now.  I put the write up together in a couple of hours over a pot of coffee this week.  Feels good digging through a pile of pics, the memories just rush right in.    Yea I hear yea.. no more 'snow days'... got to keep it up!  We both know absolutely nothing about ice fishing... but how hard can it be to jig a hole?  I've read about 'tip ups' but I don't really know how they work yet.  I guess I'll be expermenting different techniques in a couple of months."
261110,Rich Clemens,2008-10-24 10:06:00,3131,Great report Gov.  sure hope most folks get a long coffee break.   Thanks for posting.
261112,Roy,2008-10-24 10:20:00,13728,"Thanks for the great report, Governator. It's really special that you had the foresight to document your very first season of fishing. Thanks again for the great read."
261115,Bly,2008-10-24 11:38:00,1556,"Thoroughly enjoyed this write up     Parts of it were like a walk down memory lane for me.  My Len Thompson Red Devil was my ""leave it on until I catch something"" lure   You have done well and I look forward to reading about your future successes."
261119,bigugli,2008-10-24 12:17:00,6138,"Yer on your way to becoming to becoming a reel fishhead, like the rest of us junkies.  By the way, you'll learn there is no such thing as a non-fishing season. But for the colder months invest in the survival suit. They insulate as well as keep you afloat. The Mustang suit is so warm  that a couple of my buds wear nothing but a smile inside the suits. It doesn't take much to suffer from hypothermia from fall through to spring if you don't prepare for the weather. Enjoy the addiction, and to help avoid the ""skunk"" have a couple of plan ""B""s  for when the target species won't co-operate. Who cares what species you catch as long as you're out fishing."
261129,BeRad3000,2008-10-24 13:12:00,65,"He's hooked! Save the mini for the ice, thats funny that he pulled in his pb pike on it...lol"
261134,corvette1,2008-10-24 13:20:00,1765,great report welcome aboard congrats
261135,snag,2008-10-24 13:23:00,1932,"Great write up!  Now that CCMT has hopefully exhausted his PB's, perhaps you can be the new PB king!!!!   Awesome job!"
261145,HTHM,2008-10-24 13:53:00,4082,"Thank you for a wonderful read. I envy you having a steady fishing partner, as time goes on you will both become experts. If it is pike you want, check out Sask or NORTH ontario. WTG!"
261148,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-10-24 14:00:00,1362,Great report guys!!!
261166,ccmtcanada,2008-10-24 14:44:00,7971,"Amazing...amazing...amazing!  Thanks for taking the time to post this report with pictures.  I think it's something that everyone on here can relate to in one way or another.  All the hard work and dedication has paid off big time....not just with your results, but with what you've learned and the times spent outside with your family and your buddy.  I hope to see many many reports from you in the future....you can hear the passion you have for fishing in your words....  "
261254,Governator,2008-10-24 19:25:00,879," Haha thanks - I assume over my first few years PBs will come quite often... at least I hope    Absolutely, it's been a huge learning curve for both of us to try to gain skills pretty quickly.  Infact credit goes to you for showing me how to handle pike as I asked for a help last month  I only hope I can one day put together the type of reports you guys all do.  So many of you pull out sea monsters."
