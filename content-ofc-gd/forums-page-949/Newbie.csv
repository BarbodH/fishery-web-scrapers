261487,kostya,2008-10-25 14:52:00,3,"hi everyone. Im new to the forum. Just moved to hamilton from toronto i like your site, didnt fish latley because of alot of work, now have some time hope to catch some steelheads. If anyone could give me some help that would be great.  Thanks"
261489,Greencoachdog,2008-10-25 15:04:00,8163,"Welcome to the board!  There's plenty of help here, maybe not so much directly... but if you'll read the reports and pay attention.  The steelheaders on here can be pretty snitty at times, and going out and doing the legwork is half the fun anyway... post your successful and not so successful trips here and you'd probably get mare tips.  Bribing us with past fish pictures may help... and if you don't know how to post pics it'll get you started!"
261494,Marko,2008-10-25 15:12:00,854,"Hey bud welcome aboard! ITs a great place to learn about fishing and living in Toronto you are in the area that gets some prime steelhead runs. Most tribs that get salmon will get some bows as well, all you have to do is find them. Good luck!"
261495,kostya,2008-10-25 15:14:00,3,cant find any.thanks anyway
261497,Greencoachdog,2008-10-25 15:18:00,8163, Start with a good map of your area to find likely water bodies.  Google Earth should help.
