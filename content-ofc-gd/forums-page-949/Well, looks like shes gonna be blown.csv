261155,kemper,2008-10-24 14:13:00,2232,"Coming home from school this weekend for one of my VERY few oppourtunities at some fall steelheading. Last year I got out almost every day but now that Im living in Guelph (a town which has never seen a trout, less the store bought kind) I can only get out maybe 2 times a month. This weekend it looks like every river in ontario is going to get blown out with 40mm or more of rain.  Great.  ah well, Ill be out there saturday at first light drowning the most gigantic roe bags ever no matter what.  On the bright side, all you lucky ducks that still have a shot at the east tribs whenever you like...Its going to be on FIRE this week.  Hopefully the `geen isnt blown when I get there tuesday...if it is I might just jump in and call it a day.  play safe out there, the water is getting cold"
261158,ccmtcanada,2008-10-24 14:24:00,7971,Good luck on Tuesday Kemper...I think you are right though...too much rain coming tonight and tomorrow for the eastern tribs this weekend.  I'm sure you'll pull a few out though!
261159,lew,2008-10-24 14:26:00,12767, Should be fun lookin for muskies on the St. Lawrence River next Monday & Tuesday  Maybe we better attach some bells to our baits........
261163,kemper,2008-10-24 14:28:00,2232,"if the forecast is right...and it usually is when you want to go fishing and weather is going to ruin it (the only time its ever right) I figure Ill have from about first light until 9 am where the river might actually be PRIME.  All depends on how much dirt gets washed in.  If oshawa is blown im gonna head to wilmot and see how that is, it seems to be a little more resistant to blowouts, probably because its usually so low and clear"
261169,jdmls,2008-10-24 15:02:00,575,blown is pretty much it ... you may have a shot at first light when the systems are on the rise ... you have PM
261172,kemper,2008-10-24 15:18:00,2232,"  from you? I didnt get one.  unless you directed someone to me, in which case i did get one"
261175,tipupesox,2008-10-24 15:29:00,167,Going to hit some WNY Lake Erie tribs as well at first light.  Some of the smaller to med tribs have been running pretty clear this week.  Hopefully they will be green in the morning and not chocolate.
261190,12footspringbok,2008-10-24 16:13:00,459,"Should be perfect up here this weekend, the water has gotten awfully clear the past week with these cold nights, And on the plus side i'll most likely be the only one standing in the rain!"
261191,kemper,2008-10-24 16:14:00,2232,where  are you from... huron tribs?  I was thinking about heading to the saugeen or the maitland or sauble depending on conditions tuesday..but with  all the rain expected i might wait till friday
261195,12footspringbok,2008-10-24 16:28:00,459,"There only calling for 10-15mm of rain tomorrow for Barrie, and another 10mm sunday."
261197,jdmls,2008-10-24 16:36:00,575,  LOL ...It would help if you put a location in your avtar
261236,ketchenany,2008-10-24 18:24:00,3229,  Langstaff and Islington!
261257,Paulus,2008-10-24 19:30:00,522,"Blown is right. But Guelp is close to the Grand... ok it's a bit of a jaunt to where the chromers are, but it's closer than the Shwa for sure."
261259,kemper,2008-10-24 19:36:00,2232,"yes it is... I didnt think about that, although I dont know if I can afford to do a saugeen run AND a grand run next week."
261263,solopaddler,2008-10-24 19:44:00,8605,"BAH, there's always prime conditions to be found somewhere in the east. Monsoon or not. Just have to know where to look."
261266,kemper,2008-10-24 19:51:00,2232,"  Oh great steelhead guru, wont thou please enlighten me!  haha yes, I agree I suppose... Ive got a bit of a plan.  Oshawa, and then I will head east from there until I find something fishable.  If I am off, let a brother know"
261333,misfish,2008-10-24 22:34:00,29133,"Wind and a tree stand. I will be rocked to sleep. LOL  No matter,get your butt out there. You just never know."
261595,jdmls,2008-10-25 22:16:00,575,"Got out this morning in the non-stop rain an headed east....rain didn't stop from the minute I left my house , to the minute I left the creek . Only saw one other guy all morning,  at a location that would have welcomed a zoo of people if it wasn't raining. Despite the heavy rainfall, waters were prime until about 11 then the chocolate rolled in...Let's just say the outing was well worth getting drenched for !!!"
261605,silvio,2008-10-25 23:07:00,433, lol Agreed I think I am even wet under my skin lol. it was cool to see the river blow over a period of time and all those massive trees floating down with more rain in the forecast going to be awhile before we get any decent vis tomo is definitely a right off.
261652,KelfuN,2008-10-26 00:30:00,246,"greattttt.  i was planning to head towards the eastern tribs tomorrow morning, would it still be worth going?"
261658,silvio,2008-10-26 00:44:00,433, Roe bags the size of tennis balls might work. When we left because it was so blown I saw a log the had to weight about 500 pounds float down which means it was raining hard up top blowing lots of stuff down. All that rain up top will blow out the bottom ends tomo might be the day u catch up on your sleep. Put it this way we left because it was blown with more rain tonight it wont get any better!!
261661,Greencoachdog,2008-10-26 00:49:00,8163,40 millimeters?... that's like $1.27 U.S. eh?  Y'all measure your fish in inches... your rain in millimeters...and snow in centimeters???  What's up with that?
261668,Rich,2008-10-26 00:57:00,3927,I think you spelled BROWN wrong cuz the rivers will be full of them! I only wish I could be trib fishing after or during this rain. My favourite time to go!
261671,silvio,2008-10-26 01:07:00,433,Browns  the only brown thing right now is the water rich when it clears a bit in a few days there should be a few kicking around but our numbers arenâ€™t huge.
