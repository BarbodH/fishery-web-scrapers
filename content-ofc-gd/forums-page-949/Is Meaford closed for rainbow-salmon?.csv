261633,okumasheffield,2008-10-26 00:02:00,318,Drove by Meaford area today and noticed some anglers were fishing Checked regs and could not find Big Head River under any extended/all year sections  I thought it is closed for rainbow/salmon .. isnt it?
261656,Fisherman,2008-10-26 00:36:00,7201,"I think there is a mistake in the regs, as far as I know it's open from the bridge in Meaford downstream through the harbour.  Like usual, make changes to keep us wondering, it's now listed under zone 14 for open season all year. http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/198842.pdf"
261674,steelhead hunter,2008-10-26 01:16:00,152,NO meaford is not closed it is still open till dec 31  if you read the regs most of GBAY is closed which is wrong they screwed up the regs again they try to make them simpler and screw it up worse   don't bother reading the regs call the MNR office in the area that you are going to fish in
261745,solopaddler,2008-10-26 12:52:00,8605,Seems to be fewer anglers on the Bighead this fall. Wish they'd screw up the reg's more often!
