The drive shaft on my 25hp merc broke on the long weekend.Luckily I have a spare motor for parts and was able to rebuild it. As the rebuild went pretty good, this has me interested on rebuilding the old motor.However finding parts has not been easy.Does anybody know where one can find parts other than a marina.They are so expensive.The one up north wanted 850.00 to repair.It only took me about 2 hours.  Thanks in advance Greg"
