Any tips or new colours i should try would be greatly appreciated.   Here's the rabbit fur jigs:     Marabou jigs:     And also some fly's i bought:      Thanks again Kemper for the tutorial.

261839,bassfighter,2008-10-26 16:23:00,366,"Tibbs,  I pressume the lure resembles A fly.  I thought steehead will only consume them during spring, roe or minnow are mostly consumed during winter.  Please explain its application or reason on steelhead taking your lures during winter months.  Are there underwater flies during winter months?  Thanks."

261842,kemper,2008-10-26 16:32:00,2232,"oh and the bright pink one, and the pink/orange ones are going to be killer!"

261890,ehg,2008-10-26 19:13:00,2666," Nice job on tying those jigs Tibbs!  Kemper i received a PM a couple of years ago from some guy Nater who made steelie jigs, maybe look him up if you need jigs!"
262039,tibbs,2008-10-27 00:41:00,650,Thanks everyone.   Hi there bassfighter. I believe that there are still some insects in the water during the winter like nymphs and stoneflies.    That must suck!
