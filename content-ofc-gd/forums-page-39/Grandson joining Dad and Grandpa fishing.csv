1050862,lew,2019-10-10 10:11:00,12766,Ontario is a VERY large place so it may help with your question is you say where you live and what part of the province you want to fish in.

1050870,AKRISONER,2019-10-10 13:45:00,5558,"Id also ask, what species are grandad and dad comfortable fishing for. Theres plenty of great bass lakes, but id still argue you need to have a clue in order to get on the fish."

There is nothing worse to spoil a fishing trip as great expectations. If they are young teens well good luck. I fished until I was around 12  then nothing until I was in my mid 20's. Sports and most importantly, girls, girls, girls."
1051051,BillM,2019-10-14 23:03:00,17367,"If you want fish after fish do a flyin in one of the millions of walleye/pike lakes in this province.  Doesn't get much easier then a jig and twister tail.   When you get bored of that, pick up your med/heavy spinning rod and cast spoons for pike.    Won't find anything easier then this."
