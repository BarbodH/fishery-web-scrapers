I arrive Wednesday morning and leave Thursday evening.  are there any immediate fishing opportunities that I could try out Wednesday afternoon? Thursday will be devoted to work, but perhaps there’s an opportunity to wet a line within a somewhat reasonable driving distance. feel free to PM me if you’d rather share info that way. Thanks!"
1051166,AKRISONER,2019-10-16 19:11:00,5558,"my research says theirs great urban angling opportunities, but I will have a car and would think that there has to be some fly fishing opportunities within a couple hours of the city? Im not looking to totally blow anyone's spots, I will literally be there for 1 afternoon, and may never get the opportunity to fish the area again. Any guidance anyone can provide is greatly appreciated."

1051171,AKRISONER,2019-10-16 20:23:00,5558,"trust me Nip was a thought, but i dont have a boat at my disposal and it might be a bit far to run just for the afternoon. That might be saved for a trip next year with the boat in tow."
1051175,AKRISONER,2019-10-16 22:58:00,5558,cascade falls might be exactly what I am looking for...thank god for Gord Ellis.

1051371,AKRISONER,2019-10-22 13:53:00,5558," ugh i just realized this as well, was too busy looking at the rainbow regs. Might need to see if any steel have made a run."
1051383,BillM,2019-10-22 15:40:00,17367,Check out that river I mentioned.
1051397,OhioFisherman,2019-10-22 16:20:00,6623,"They are catching Steelhead around the river mouths here on Lake Erie, I would imagine they are farther along that far north?"
