1051262,Big Cliff,2019-10-19 10:53:00,6899,I have posted it in the classifieds and will be putting it on some other sites as well but I'm not sure what other information I should be posting. If some of you guys that frequently sell stuff on line could take a quick look and give me some suggestions I'd really appreciate it. 
1051267,cisco,2019-10-19 15:32:00,597,Nice ride. 8.1 liter gas engine so miles per gallon or kms per liter is interesting to know IMHO.
1051268,misfish,2019-10-19 16:00:00,29133,"Selling to buy a bigger one ?  How much bigger have you gott,n there Big Cliff ?"
1051275,Old Ironmaker,2019-10-19 20:21:00,8243,"Nice ride. I have always wanted to get one but my wife has zero interest in the lifestyle. I rented one for a week once and headed to Myrtle Beach, she wanted to bail after the 1st night. Maybe I'll just buy yours and go solo. Why may I ask why you aren't going to use it any longer Cliff? If I was single I'd sell my house and hit the road for a few years. Canada spring to late Fall then point the thing until the compass say S and keep it there until I see Palm trees. AQctually I know a widower that does the exact same thing. People he knows will fly to where he is and join him for a few weeks. He has a little electric scooter in the back for shopping etc. perfect."

1051284,misfish,2019-10-20 00:25:00,29133,"You do know, Terry fish,s the afternoon shift ."
1051286,ketchenany,2019-10-20 00:42:00,3229,Those retired guys! Sleep until noon! You drive while he sleeps and when he wakes up he can fish! 
1051297,Big Cliff,2019-10-20 11:21:00,6899,"Thank you, I appreciate the suggestion, I have added that info."
1051298,Big Cliff,2019-10-20 11:25:00,6899,"LOL, I have had some nice fishing trips with it already this summer, it's completely self sufficient, setup takes less than 3 minutes and you've got all the comforts of home."
