1050881,PUMP KNOWS,2019-10-10 19:54:00,937,Does anyone on here own one?  If so how do you like it? So far I've looked online and they sell for around $950 on Amazon.   I was told it might be cheaper to buy it from Walmart in the US when they go on sale. I might purchase one if I can find a good deal on it. 
1050884,bobowski,2019-10-10 20:04:00,360,"""Misfish""  member on here would be the guy to talk to."
1050885,misfish,2019-10-10 20:51:00,29133,"Maybe he has not seen my reports and videos.  I really like mine. I have a 55lb thrust and a 37lb weight,  battery on mine. I have it balanced out just right. Finder,go pro and rod holders. I get 3 mph top speed.  If you do not know, you can now order them through Walmart here. They will ship it up for you FREE.      "
1050909,muskybw,2019-10-11 13:05:00,116,"lots of them on the maitland river when rainbows open the end of april, lots of 2 seaters !"
1050915,PUMP KNOWS,2019-10-11 15:28:00,937,Bobwski - thanks misfish - how safe do you feel on it? Also have you found the Colorado xt to go on sale on the Canadian site?  My buddy told me to keep an eye out on the US site for rollbacks. muskybw - I can see that being so much fun
1050917,misfish,2019-10-11 16:12:00,29133,"I have been tooning for the past 4-5 years now. never felt unsafe in the least. PFD is always on, I have had a few air leaks. Pin holes due to my own happening. When it leaks,it,s very slow. Always make it back to shore with the bladder still more then 3/4 full. I have been out a few miles on Simcoe. They are very comfortable. I have yet to see them here at walmart. But like I said,they will bring over for you for FREE.  "
1050918,misfish,2019-10-11 16:15:00,29133,"Too add, Terry and Dave ( Drifter ) have one as well."
1050919,DRIFTER_016,2019-10-11 16:25:00,10439,It's true!!! Actually I have 2 toons. My good one is a Fishcat Cougar with quad tubes. I have run some pretty big rivers with it and never felt unsafe even with my best friend sitting on the platform behind me.  
1050920,Terry,2019-10-11 16:40:00,14456,  I had 2 toons I sold one to Brian i am really surprised just how stable they are in big waves and on a calm day you couldn’t tip it if you wanted to. I have had a 40 lbs thrust trolling and full size battery motor and a 2.5 hp outboard on it at the same time and by moving the seat forward it was just fine been using them for many years  
1051117,PUMP KNOWS,2019-10-16 01:19:00,937," When you have air leaks do you find it very noticeable when you're out on the water?   That's awesome!  Your dog just chills on the back while you're out fishing? I'll have to look into a fishcat pontoon as well.  Is your other toon a colorado?   Wow.. with all that stuff on your toon, you never had any issues with it buckling due to weight?"
1051121,Terry,2019-10-16 01:29:00,14456,No the seat moves so that shifts a lot of weight to where it balances sometimes I put the trolling motor on the front if I am using the gas motor that day. But never had a problem once I figured it out
1051155,DRIFTER_016,2019-10-16 16:25:00,10439,Can't remember the make of my other toon but it is not a Colorado. Cheaper quality than the Colorado. I have a couple of friends in Alaska with the Colorado's and they are nice boats. 
1051157,misfish,2019-10-16 17:20:00,29133,"After a couple of hours. These are pin holes, so leak is slow. I do not carry a manual pump, but will be next season.  Like I said, these are due to my own fault. The way it was sitting in the back of the truck deflated. The frame was bouncing on the toon and well it made pin holes. I use shoe goop or most recently, blue marine caulking. Both work fine."
1051158,BillM,2019-10-16 17:27:00,17367,Colorado is made by Classic Accessories.  A lot of those pontoons are.  I've got one that I haven't been out on in ages.
1051165,DRIFTER_016,2019-10-16 18:58:00,10439,Another thing to remember is let some of the air out when it's not in the water. Heat from the sun can actually over inflate the bladder and burst it along the seam. I always carry my pump along with me. I have inflated the bladders properly on land only to have them get soft in short order due to the cold water. This happened to me once. It sucked. Aquaseal worked mint to fix the issue though.  Watched a guy in Alaska have an issue with his toon once. He was pulled out on the island across from the launch when Yogi came along and had a taste of one of his pontoons. He had his pump with him and managed to make it back to the launch before deflation.
1051172,misfish,2019-10-16 20:49:00,29133,"That happened to my first one. I leave mine in the truck deflated. I guess the one valve closed . It blew so much,my tonno cover was raised up in the middle. DOH. I always let a bit of air out when out on those hot days. Between the water temp and the sun, they expand ."
1051187,ckewley,2019-10-17 11:47:00,699,"Not a Colorado either but will say I've never felt unsafe on this gal & with the 2.5 she's pretty swift. It has been on pretty much every water body in southern Ontario. It packs up quite small, maybe 60lbs (minus motor) would fit in the trunk of my old Civic. Motor & accessories would be in the back seat or roof bag when I bought one. It is a little much if you're solo but if you can trailer it/store it inflated, there are some great mods out there. You can usually find these pretty cheap second hand! "
1051415,PUMP KNOWS,2019-10-22 18:43:00,937,Thanks guys...lots of info to take in. Thats a sweet setup
1051422,Barney,2019-10-23 13:48:00,2,"I was lucky enough to have a friend give me a Classic Accessories Madison pontoon boat. I haven't had it in the water yet, but I was wondering what's the best anchor to use? The boat will probably split time between lakes and trout streams."
1051423,DRIFTER_016,2019-10-23 14:50:00,10439,"I use a homemade 12# pyramid anchor. It's like this one only it was free because I had the lead and made my own mold. FYI, you should pick up the proper anchor system from the manufacturer for raising and lowering the anchor. It makes life much easier. https://www.oregonfishing.com/Pyramid-Lead-Anchors----8lb/10lb--PLA7  "
1051426,BillM,2019-10-23 15:51:00,17367,"You'll need something a lot lighter for the stream compared to a lake (You're not fishing from the pontoon while stream fishing).. 99% of the time you're tossing the anchor on shore anyhow.  I used an old receiver+ball.  Worked great, didn't weigh a tonne and kept it secure."
1051429,misfish,2019-10-23 17:17:00,29133,I use this one and have 4 ft of chain attached as well.  
1051431,DRIFTER_016,2019-10-23 17:43:00,10439,I've got one of those for my kayak.
1051473,Barney,2019-10-24 16:35:00,2,Thanks for all the good advice!
