1051577,GBW,2019-10-27 22:12:00,8460,Not sure how good this one is but I got it to hopefully get anyone caught on camera if they break into my car and or garage.  My one question is how far away does the object have to be for it to turn on and take pic's/video?  I set it up last night and walked by it close and no pic's taken when I looked today.  All my test where I would walk to the lake from the camera area it picked me up 1/2 way down to the lake BUT it didn't pick me up on the way back up!!!  Bad unit sensor?  Here is the unit info: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07SB4L93M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

1051579,GBW,2019-10-27 22:31:00,8460,This one sadly doesn't connect via Wi-Fi.  And setting it up in the house against the 2 pane window doesn't work well due to glare...  Ugh... Might need to buy something else.

1051585,Terry,2019-10-27 23:21:00,14456,it lights don’t like glass. You pretty much have to have it out side.  	you can buy a WiFi security  fairly cheap. It can record to a card or to a computer

1051750,Fisherman,2019-10-30 21:39:00,7201,I find that an object (crook) coming straight at the camera is less likely to get picked up than an object going across from left to right or other way.
