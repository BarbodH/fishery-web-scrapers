1051708,DRIFTER_016,2019-10-29 22:25:00,10439,Wasn't me or mine. Clipped it from the paper when it was posted. I wouldn't eat the fish out of this lake as they are very wormy. There is a power plant on the lake and the water temps are warmer than other lakes around because of it. The warm water grows fish fast but wormy.
