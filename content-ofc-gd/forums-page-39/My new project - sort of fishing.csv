1051145,gordy28,2019-10-16 13:57:00,638,Over the last few years I have really gotten a kick out of writing trip reports.  I certainly don't think of myself as a writer but after some encouragement I have taken the time to build out my own blog. Full disclosure its more of an outdoor blog than a fishing blog (although will definitely slant towards fishing) Wanted to share with this community as  this site is where I first got the writing big so to speak when we were researching our first trip many years ago The goal is to average between 1 to 2 posts per week Also feel free to request content here or pm me Site is northernjacks.com  Cheers Andrew aka Gordy
