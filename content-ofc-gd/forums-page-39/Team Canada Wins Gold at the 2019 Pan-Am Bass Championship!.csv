In August there was a qualifier held there to form Team Canada, I was lucky enough to qualify along with partner, Rob Lee 2nd overall. Team Canada 2019 was made up of captains, Bob & Darren Izumi, Andy Kinstler & Scott Lecky, myself & Rob Lee, Jason Gramada & Nicolas Gendron, Stephen & Phil Hegarty, Brian Hughes & Anais Chaves, Matt Massey & Robert Greenberg & Ryan Flaro & Bob MacKenzie! Weather was a huge factor as day 1 was cancelled and the event came down to 2 half day tournaments on what would have been day 2! Although Team USA swept the pairs medals, Team Canada won the Nations gold over a star studded line-up of American bass pros which included Bass Fan's #1 ranked pro, Jacob Wheeler, 4 time FLW AOY, David Dudley, Scott & legend Roland Martin, Team Mexico and a First Nations team! An average weight of all the pairs was used to determine to Nations gold medalists! Now I have a gold to go with my silver medal from the 2018 Pan-Am Bass Championship on Lake Okeechobee! Full results can found on the FLW siteÂ https://www.flwfishing.com/tips/2019-10-18-canada-wins-gold-at-pan-am This is definitely a hi-light of my fishing career, there was nothing on the line but national pride and the medals! Special thanks to FLW's Jody White for some great coverage! "
