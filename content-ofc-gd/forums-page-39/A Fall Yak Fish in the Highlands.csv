1050707,gordy28,2019-10-06 12:49:00,638,"I had shared a while ago that I had bought a fishing kayak at the end of summer There were two big motivators - to get out more and to access some lakes I haven't ever fished Last weekend my brother and I made our way up to the cottage - plan was to hang out and enjoy the quiet, the fire and a few beers and get up in the AM to a small lake we know  When we got to the lake we realized that we were going to either need to get really muddy/wet to launch or we probably had to trespass.  Mulling the decision my brother said ""You know there is another lake 10 minutes from here that is similar but it has a launch""  So off we headed  This lake is a small bowl - about 30 feet deep in the middle with mainly sharp dropping shorelines.  Generally on these lakes we have had the most success finding tapering flats with cabbage beds and getting to the deep side, basically just outside of the weed growth.  Paddling around we really didn't get far before my brother hooked into a beauty smallmouth sitting off a fallen tree.  Within 5 minutes of that I hooked a juvenile muskie casting an Xrap around some lillies.  Moving around the lake we didn't really get anything for about 35 minutes  - nothing around fallen trees or cabbage beds.  Moving around the lake my brother hooked into a nice largemouth.  He had been casting a wacky rigged worm just outside of the lillies.  About 3 feet deep.  I moved over to the far side of the bay and we started really getting into the bass.  What was interesting is we caught almost a perfect split of large and smallmouths.  Also interesting that it was in about 3 to 5 feet of water.  Overall we caught around 9 good sized bass, a few little guys and a 25 inch muskie - not bad for about 3 hours of fishing on a new lake. For the two of us it was a resounding success! I am still getting used to the yak - I have fished in it around 4 times now - I struggle a bit with boat control (especially compared to my bro who has a Hobie Angler with the Mirage drive) but I feel like I get better each time out. A big part of the allure is ease and access - where we went in you would have been hard pressed launching anything other than a small car topper - but with the kayaks - no problems at all Probably going for one more trip at least - will post a report as always Cheers Andrew (aka Gordy)"
1050726,misfish,2019-10-06 19:09:00,29133,Do not forget about us tooners. We can access anywhere as well.  Great report gordy

1050735,Bly,2019-10-07 00:11:00,1556,"Nice write up Andrew, thank you far taking the time!  I kick around the idea of getting a fishing kayak now and then..great to read that you are enjoying it.  Tight lines!"
1050736,muskybw,2019-10-07 00:26:00,116,"hey guys, i know how much fun you had, great pics !  i do the same thing on a small private lake in west guilford, CHEERS !"
1050738,chris.brock,2019-10-07 00:49:00,4053,"Nice Andrew! you guys did good, it makes me look forward to next weekend when I can do a similar adventure"
1050744,David Chong,2019-10-07 13:07:00,836,Definitely a great way to access those secret gems! Been thinking about it myself!
1050745,gordy28,2019-10-07 13:35:00,638,Thanks all  - Brian I looked at a float based on all of your reports but my bro jumped the gun and got a Kayak and once I tried his there was no going back lol Tons of sites and places with articles on which kayak and why - but feel free to PM me if anyone has any questions as I looked for about 6 months before I bit the bullet - happy to provide my two cents Hoping to head out one or two more times before its to cold Cheers Andrew
1050754,misfish,2019-10-07 16:19:00,29133,"If I were to go to the yak,it would be peddle or motorized. Also have stabilizers. A MUST for me. LOL"
1050789,SirCranksalot,2019-10-08 01:13:00,3291,No canoeists here? The most portable boat of all!! 
1051036,Dutch01,2019-10-14 13:26:00,1431,Thanks for the report - I love seeing kayak fishing reports! I enjoy kayak fishing so much that I realized I wasn't using my boat anymore so I sold it. Was just out on Saturday and picked up this hawg (sorry night pics are hard) Check out Kawartha Kayak Fishing Club on Facebook if you want to link up with an active community.  
1051040,pics,2019-10-14 14:15:00,1268,I regret not bringing my yak up to Greenstone.  So many places to fish with it..
1051050,gordy28,2019-10-14 21:51:00,638,Dutch that's a beauty walleye Haven't had the chance to target walleye in my yak yet but will definitely spend some time trying for them next summer at the cottage Cheers Gordy
1051059,Dutch01,2019-10-15 01:43:00,1431,Thanks Gordy. I'll still be going out for about another month or so. After that I hit the rivers until the ice comes.
1051064,Old Ironmaker,2019-10-15 03:04:00,8243,"You guys sure did it right. Thay sounds like a dream weekend, especially if you can share it will someone you care for. Fall for me is my favorite season and especially for fishing. Any species. You need to do some catching up and rig your toons like Missfish's. Dutch01, that is a real hog you got there., especially for the Kawartha's. Way to go."
1051108,Dutch01,2019-10-15 20:33:00,1431,Thanks - believe it or not I get quite a few that size every year at this spot. I cant seem to catch a damn thing there during the day though so it's a good thing I like the night shift!
