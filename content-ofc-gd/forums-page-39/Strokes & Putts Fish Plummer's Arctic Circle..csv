With a drone along, my buddy captured some great videos and photos, including the photoshoot and release of Bren's giant.Â  The extra shots make this report something special.Â  Anyways, it's a cool read, loaded with pictures and for those whoseÂ fishing is slowing down, it's good and free entertainment to pass the time. Here's the link... Strokes & Putts Fish Plummer's Arctic Circle Lodge.      Later doods! :) "

1051700,Moosebunk,2019-10-29 20:28:00,3970,"Thanks fellas! Bill, I can see this trip happening again some years down the road. For big lakers there is no better place than Bear. For numbers, Arctic Circle may be hard to beat as well. Won't be heading back anytime soon, cause it's kind of a case of been there, done that at the moment... but as years go by plenty places are worth a revisit and, changing it up with a different group can make it new again. You and the missus as part of a group of 12 would be great!Â  Of all the northern spots for bucketlist lakers, this should be the top one."
