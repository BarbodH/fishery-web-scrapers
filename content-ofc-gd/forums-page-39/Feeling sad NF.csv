1050620,Big Cliff,2019-10-04 10:17:00,6899,"Susan Dale Bignell     Sept. 17, 1946 - Oct. 4, 2017 😥 She started each day with an “I love you!” 	and she meant it I could tell. 	Then her face would light up with a mischievous grin, 	It was a look I knew so well. She would look at me with her big blue eyes, 	you could see the laughter there. 	Then she’d shake her head and the sunlight danced, 	from the streaks in her golden hair. She always had time for a hug and a kiss, 	she always wore a smile. 	No matter how busy her day became, 	she’d listen to me for a while. She always made me feel like a king, 	or at least let me think that I am. 	But one thing in this world I’ll never doubt, 	and that is that I was her man. She ended each day as it began, 	with one more “I love you!” 	Then she’d cuddle up and I’d hold her tight, 	you see, I loved her too! Forever in my heart! Clifford S Bignell "
