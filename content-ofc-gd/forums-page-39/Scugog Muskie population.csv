1051345,tomkat,2019-10-21 22:56:00,246,Just wondering about the health of the population. I feel my success has decreased over the years. Has anybody else noticed the same?
1051483,Sinker,2019-10-24 20:17:00,8692,I gave up on scugog. Used to be my go to lake. Its changed a lot in the last 5 years or so. S.
1051516,Rizzo,2019-10-26 11:35:00,4754,"only been there twice...both were last year. At opener we got 5 in one day, in late fall we went o for 1...so my results are mixed!"
1051517,lew,2019-10-26 11:41:00,12766,Any size to them Roger ?
1051530,captpierre,2019-10-27 00:49:00,2521,Used to do very well in Scugog.  Got my 52 inch there and lots in mid 40’s. The lake is different now no doubt with the walleye collapse and closed season. We drive over the causeway most weekends and don’t see many boats on the water.
1051533,Tjames09,2019-10-27 01:16:00,664,"Could be lots of reasons. People catch and keep without knowing, or catch by accident and end up killing because they take to long to unhook and get back in water properly. Lots of guys bass fishing catch them on spinner baits all the time and don’t have any nets or tools to handle a big fish."
1051534,tomkat,2019-10-27 01:23:00,246,Yeah I was just wondering what’s going on? What caused the walleye collapse? And I wonder if they have researched the musky fishery?  I couldn’t find any info poking around online.
1051609,Rizzo,2019-10-28 12:41:00,4754,...negative. all between 35-40. But at least keeps you interested!
1051615,lew,2019-10-28 13:00:00,12766,"For sure Roger, even little fish can be fun sometimes"
1051620,jimmer,2019-10-28 14:01:00,2730,"https://scugoglakestewards.com/ There are still walleye in that lake. I believe any lake that is within 2 hours of Toronto is fished heavily and has an impact on fish populations. Yes, people will say it's the introduction of Crappie or global warming, etc, but the lakes are definitely busier these days. I haven't heard much about the muskie lately. Just my opinion."
