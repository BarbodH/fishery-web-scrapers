1051080,tb4me,2019-10-15 16:57:00,3295,"Ok so I was out all day yesterday on the water. Pull to the dock to drop off the kid and dog. I started the motor and drove off..Get to the boat launch to run it up on the trailer and she wont slow down! Push it into neutral and damn near blow the engine. Quickly shut it off and open engine cover. Throttle wont return to idle on its own..It will go, just not return.Broken throttle cable in the plastic housing at the motor .Needless to say that was fun getting it on the trailer. 	Anyhow normally id just drop it off to  get it fixed..With Walleye closing soon on the Trent River I cant afford the down time. Can anyone help me figure out what throttle cable I need? I measured 12 feet. The motor is a Johnson 70 HP serial and model #s are as follows 	Ser# is C 8226263 	mod# is cj70tlcca  	Are these cables fairly generic? Or are they very specific?  	Any help would be absolutely wonderful!"
1051085,DRIFTER_016,2019-10-15 17:28:00,10439,Cables are most likely not generic. You will need to see an OMC dealer in order to get a replacement most likely.
1051091,tb4me,2019-10-15 18:09:00,3295,Would love a part # so i can order it on Amazon maybe...Having one heck of a time finding that info out..
1051095,Garnet,2019-10-15 18:56:00,2056,Bellville Sport and Lawn have been OMC dealer forever. Emerald Ise Marine OMC for ever.
1051098,tb4me,2019-10-15 19:44:00,3295,Thanks folks. I think i have it figured out. It sucks having the boat 3 hours from my driveway
1051099,DRIFTER_016,2019-10-15 19:47:00,10439,This one look familiar? https://www.wholesalemarine.com/tfxtreme-control-cable-for-johnson-evinrude-omc-1979-newer/  And on Amazon: https://www.amazon.ca/Teleflex-CC20512-12-Feet-Marine-Control/dp/B0000AXTAC/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=CC20512&psc=1&qid=1571168813&sr=8-2
1051104,floater,2019-10-15 20:13:00,220,Part number of cable is usually stamped on the black plastic part or painted on the black sleeve.
1051106,tb4me,2019-10-15 20:21:00,3295,Yes Im sure that's it...Thanks
1051107,tb4me,2019-10-15 20:23:00,3295,Yeah I just learned that today now that im 3.5 hrs from my boat...lol . Sure would have made things much easier  
1051113,Old Ironmaker,2019-10-15 23:50:00,8243,Why did it break in the 1st place? I'd like to know that before I broke another one. Not a common breakdown in my experience. It will be tough to get someone to do it for you at this time of the year anyway. Try iboats.com for a new part. They will have it I'm positive. Good luck and get back out there.
1051115,Whitespinnerbait,2019-10-16 00:51:00,2038,Because the motor is a 1988 = 31 years old = fatigued
1051124,Big Cliff,2019-10-16 01:47:00,6899,"Where is the boat, if anywhere in the Kawarthas area I can go to it in the morning and try to get the part number for you pm me if that will help"
1051133,Old Ironmaker,2019-10-16 05:52:00,8243,  Cliff don't put your phone number on the internet. Delete it.
1051150,tb4me,2019-10-16 15:43:00,3295,I think it snapped from wear n tear..Its a 1988 motor and likely orignal cables. I managed to find a cable at my local dealer here in Haggersville for 65 bucks.. Ill go grab it this week
1051151,tb4me,2019-10-16 15:52:00,3295,What an amazing offer. I have sent you a pm. Thanks Cliff...cheers my friend
