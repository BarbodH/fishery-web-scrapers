Happy Thanksgiving from us here on Lake Erie to all of our OFC friends and Families."

1051007,Old Ironmaker,2019-10-13 18:00:00,8243,"Fortino's in Hamilton sells them during the Fall and Christmas Loonie.  Just cut a slit in each and bake in the oven. 400F for about 30 minutes if I remember, been a while. I like the smell more than the taste. Just keep taste testing them. I don't know where you can get those little paper bags they had them in outside Maple Leaf Gardens."

We roasted them on the BBQ and had them before dinner today. The smell brought back some great memories. Happy Thanksgiving to everyone and their Families, Johnny D."
