1051143,cwpres,2019-10-16 13:09:00,14,I heard a rumor that there are Gobies in Guelph Lake.  Can anyone confirm that?  It would be bad if there are!
1051181,Chuck Enwinde,2019-10-17 04:21:00,247,No first hand knowledge but it would take a real idiot move for that to happen.  My guess would be someone caught a sculpin and misidentified it.
1051201,Old Ironmaker,2019-10-17 19:20:00,8243,Lets hope not. I can't believe a Goby could stay alive for the time it takes to transport it from a different body of water. But it happens just like Zebra Mussels.
1051202,Garfisher,2019-10-17 19:29:00,229,https://www.eddmaps.org/ontario/distribution/point.cfm?id=8275276 They're in there...
1051209,cwpres,2019-10-17 20:55:00,14,Bummer!  I wonder how they got there...
1051211,DRIFTER_016,2019-10-17 22:00:00,10439,My guess would be someone's bait bucket. 
1051221,bigugli,2019-10-18 11:13:00,6138,Seeing as they have been i the Speed and Nith for some time. It was only a matter of time before a seed carrier (i.e. Heron) dropped eggs in the lake. Same way we now have bass in the farm pond
1051224,cwpres,2019-10-18 13:08:00,14,I've never heard of a heron seeding fish... how could this be done?  Can you site a source for that?
1051237,Old Ironmaker,2019-10-18 17:53:00,8243,It happens all the time. My buddy dug a farm pond and in just 3 years there were Carp in it. How??
1051240,bigugli,2019-10-18 18:01:00,6138,"Heron wades through the shallows, through a spawn bed, gets eggs attached to legs, flies to another body of water in search of food, shakes off a few eggs.   At the farm, the only fish stocked were bluegills and bullhead, yet 2 years ago we started finding largemouth. Herons visit regularly."
1051241,cwpres,2019-10-18 18:09:00,14,"Bass eggs aren't sticky.  They lay them in a nest, and the male bass protects them until they hatch.  I think it's unlikely that a heron could introduce bass to a pond.  It's much more likely that baby bass were introduced with the bluegills when they were sotcked, as they can look very similar as fry and live in similar habitats."
1051254,bigugli,2019-10-18 21:41:00,6138,"The stocking was done 30 years ago, the bass only started appearing 2 years ago. To date we have found 3. There are no bodies of water to migrate from."
1051256,DRIFTER_016,2019-10-18 22:05:00,10439,After the 1996 tornado in Grand Valley we had a 3# smallie end up in the backyard about 20' from our pond. It did not come from our pond. It most likely came from either Luther Marsh or Damascus Reservoir to the West of us. If it had dropped a couple of seconds earlier it may have lived in the pond.  😁
