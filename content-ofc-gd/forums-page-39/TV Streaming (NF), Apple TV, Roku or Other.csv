1051550,John,2019-10-27 14:17:00,2956,"For starters I know little to nothing about this technology. I am looking for a device to allow me to receive streaming services, Britbox, Acorn TV, Amazon Prime Video, Sports etc. Ideally I want to get rid of my very expensive Bell service, if I can keep some network channels great, if not I can learn to live without them. I don't have a Smart TV presently but probably in the market from Santa. I know that there are a few gurus and converts on here and any advise would be received with thanks. If you would prefer to PM me or text (289-828-1804) that works. John.."
1051552,misfish,2019-10-27 15:44:00,29133,"Good day John  I have a X92 box. I pay $100 a month for Bell unlimited internet. I have a guy that updates my box eveyr 6 months for $20. I watch almost everything I want. Leafs on Saturday nights on CBC live stream, Nascar on Sundays. Thats my sports fix. All movies and TV series I get. The 3 sites I use are Bee TV and Cinema free. Also use Live Net TV 4.7. Kodi is history. Find a good box and someone that will update, and you are gold."
1051553,aplumma,2019-10-27 15:47:00,6896,John check your tv for a HDMI cable port. This is how the apple tv  unit feeds information to the tv. If you have that then look at the apple tv gen 4th . While this unit is more expensive it has the ability to be controlled by a remote as well as any ipad or iphone you have with a simple app. You can control it using your voice to a certain extent which is really nice.  So far I have hulu to get all of my local channels and stuff. I found  PLUTO tv to be very entertaining (free) and use my amazon plus to view a whole range of movies and shows. So far we went from 120.00 a month to 55.00 for hulu. You can try most all of the paid services for free for a month. Art
1051570,KawarthaAngler,2019-10-27 18:43:00,273,I've been happy with 4th gen Apple TV as well.  My parents were impressed and got one as well.  It has the Apps (and many more) you are referring to so that you get those shows.
1051576,Big Cliff,2019-10-27 20:26:00,6899,"I guess I am out of date but I still use my Amazon Fire TV and have no problems with it at all, I get all my tv shows and movies on it. Is the Apple TV a much better unit?"
