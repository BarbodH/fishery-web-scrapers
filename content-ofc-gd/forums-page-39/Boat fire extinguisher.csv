1051466,captpierre,2019-10-24 14:27:00,2521,Anybody know how long a fairly cheap looking small fire extinguisher is good for? Â Mine in the Lund Â is 12 yrs. I see CT has them in sale.
1051467,John,2019-10-24 14:34:00,2956,In most cases there should be an expiry date? I would replace anything over 5 years. Definitely 12 yrs is past its best before date.
1051481,aplumma,2019-10-24 19:45:00,6896,A fire extinguisher is one of the most important items on a boat when it is on fire. I have a unit that has a gauge as well as a size that is larger than required on all of my boats. Every six months it should be checked for the charge level as well as turned upside down and tapped and agitated to make sure the powder has not clumped up in the bottom. I replace them every 4 years and then take the old unit and store it in the garage next to my current one in case one is not enough. Art

Nothing much worse than facing a fire and when you pull the pin on an extinguisher and pull the trigger all you have is your you know what in your hands. You wouldn't cheap out on a PFD I would hope. Time to check mine."
1051492,Pigeontroller,2019-10-25 01:38:00,2793,"Good thread, mine is OLD...Time to get a new one!"
1051493,John,2019-10-25 12:00:00,2956,Yup what he said!
1051495,captpierre,2019-10-25 12:49:00,2521,My 60 hp 2 str Â Merc caught fire 20 yrs ago while trolling. Not seriously but smoke from under cowling. Stopped after turning off. Was an electrical fire. Scary as hell.Kids on board and fuel ðŸ˜³
1051564,John Bacon,2019-10-27 17:16:00,3277,"I was discussing the disposal of fire extinguishers at the curling rink today.Â  One of the guys mentioned a place in Scarborough where you can exchange an old fire extinguisher for a refilled one.Â  Even if you don't want a refilled one, you can probably dispose of your old one.  https://www.herbertwilliams.com/services/fire-extinguisher-installation-inspection-testing/"
1051574,aplumma,2019-10-27 20:02:00,6896,Most local fire departments will take the old units in for free and have them properly disposed of. Art
