163358,DebS,2008-02-23 02:01:00,56,"Rich, Hope that no-one thinks that posting this poem is too dumb, but we're living on borrowed time right now with our 13 yr old Golden due to a large tumour on her lower jaw & when I get really depressed about losing her, I read this poem. It'd be nice if we really were re-united after we're gone (I know, it's pretty naive, but sometimes you need to believe in fairy tales to get through the tough things). DebS  Rainbow Bridge  Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.  When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.  All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor; those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.  They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent; His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.  You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.  Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together...."

163075,Rich Clemens,2008-02-22 13:51:00,3131,Great poem hookset ... I couldn't even make it the whole way through the first time.   I saved a copy of it to hand on to.  Very nice.
163091,Big Cliff,2008-02-22 14:37:00,6899,"Rich, I am so very sorry to hear that, I know how hard it can be but you did what had to be done and she trusted you to do what was best for her. It doesn't make the loss any easier but keep her in your heart forever. It's a warm, safe place for her to be."
163097,Hookset,2008-02-22 14:57:00,367," I really like the Poem too Rich. The Author - Beth Norman Harris (1968) - sure knew what she was saying. Her Poem is a good read from day #1 with a new Pup until the final day when we have to say ""So Long"".  Your Fishing Pal was indeed a Lucky Pup.   Hookset."
163099,maybe,2008-02-22 14:59:00,307,"So sorry for your loss, Rich.  Seems every dog person will lose at least one along the way that they'll miss terribly for years after.  These are the dogs who go way beyond ""normal critter"" to bring something rare and amazing to your life.  Missing them is a positive thing - it reminds us how lucky we've been.  There are 2 on my ""still miss list.""  One of them was a little poodle who was born without eyes, and came to us at 6 weeks old.  She never knew what she was ""missing,"" and figured out ways to do everything our sighted dog could do.  Fetch, stairs, playing with beach balls, and even jumping on and off the furniture safely.  Experiencing the world with her taught me countless invaluable lessons about being observant, thinking outside the box, and keeping a wag in your tail.  Taff developed ways to really make the most of her other senses.  New challenges were met with a prudent amount of caution, but always happily and with determination.  For the (sighted) humans in the house, closing our eyes and trying to figure out everyday situations ""from Taff's point of view"" scared us silly.  Without her extra interpretive skills, we were pretty lost.  When your Airedale's vision went, nobody could explain to her what was happening.  She didn't have time to develop coping mechanisms, and the tumor was heaping on other problems as well.  Suddenly everything's scary and confusing.  That had to be terrible to be on the ""inside"" of.  There's really only one loving thing to do in that situation, and you did it - even though it hurt you.  That deserves respect, if not applause.  She had a wonderful life.  Humans who loved her, took her fishing, and put her comfort first when the vet bills piled up.  She was a very lucky girl.  ""Don't cry because it's over.  Smile because it happened.""  --Theodor Seuss Geisel (Dr. Seuss)"
163103,bigfish1965,2008-02-22 15:04:00,3382,"So Sorry for your loss, Rich. I applaud you for the selflessness to end your friends suffering. I only hope that if faced with the same dilemma, I have the courage to dow hat you did."
163144,huey graphite,2008-02-22 16:42:00,362,My condolences to you. Dogs do become a part of the family and seeing one suffer can be painful. I have a yellow lab with a torn cruciate and is going in for surgery this Wednesday. The vet told us the less expensive ($600-$800) extracapsular procedure will be sufficient. The alternative would have been $2000-$2500 for the TPLO procedure.
163151,Rich Clemens,2008-02-22 17:02:00,3131,"Huey-Graphite.  With Nikita only 7 years old, we figured she should have quite a few good years left so we went all out for her just a mere 6 weeks ago.    Yeah, it was a lot of money, but to my wife and I, it was well worth every penny.  Thanks much to everyone who responded.  Lot of great people on this board."
163157,huey graphite,2008-02-22 17:32:00,362,"   I here ya. Had the vet recommended the TPLO I probably would have done it and find a way to pay for it later. The vet told us because our dog was no longer competing and had retired as a house pet, the extracapsular procedure would be the way to go.  And yes the wealth of info on this board is unlimited."
163180,fishnsled,2008-02-22 19:31:00,3520,It's always sad loosing a member of the family.  Sorry for you loss.
163193,Want,2008-02-22 20:12:00,39,"I didn't want to read this post because our dog is a ""senior"" fellow. I'm beginning to see signs of age in him and it's kind of hard to see that happening. I love him very much. But sharing is the best way to deal with stuff like this. I'm sure your dog had a good life and if there is a doggy heaven, I'm sure he's smiling down, wagging his tail, and all is well."
163199,Reef Runner,2008-02-22 20:22:00,981,"My condolences to you and your Rich.  Lost my German short-haired pointer before her ""expected"" time was up.  Totally sux dude.  reefrunner"

163277,DebS,2008-02-22 23:43:00,56,"Rich, I am so very sorry to hear of your loss. Having to make that decision is so hard, even when you know that's it's the kindest thing you can do for a good friend. My deepest sympathies to you and your entire family. You'll always miss your buddy and remember all the good times, but, someday, it won't hurt so much when you do remember her. DebS"
162803,Rich Clemens,2008-02-21 19:06:00,3131,"Well ... what a crappy past couple days and it sure went to pot today.    I had posted that my Airdale Terrier went through the same type of reconstructive knee surgery that Rick's dog went through.   At her two week checkup, the Vet was very happy with her progress and everything was looking great.  BUT  Yesterday she was not right at all.  She would walk and seems like she had no idea where she was going. She'd walk straight into the wall, furniture.  Would walk into a corner and stand there and whine until I moved her away.  She'd walk out the door and act like there were no steps.  Trying to walk and just fell over a couple times.  Messed on the carpet ... and it goes on and on.  Trip to the vet this am to see what the heck is going on.   Just a little while ago, I called into the vet and got horrible news.  She has a rapidly growing brain tumor - cancer that had impacted her vision and other things.  Chemo is an option, but at best, this would only shrink the tumor a bit, but it would come right back.  The condition she was in, I just could not put her through this any longer and there is no way to tell what quality of life she would have .. even if the chemo works.   We're having her creamted and she'll remain with us.  So long my faithful fishing parter.  You'll  always be with us."
162805,Tinman,2008-02-21 19:10:00,376,"awwwww I am so sorry to here about that! I know what its like to lose a pet, i still keep her tags with me. My condolences."

162857,Rich Clemens,2008-02-21 20:46:00,3131,"Just came from the vets and it really sux walking in the house with nothing but a collar in your hand.  She was always the first in the boat and got as excited as anyone when we had a fish on.  Couple times she was leaning out over the boat to see what we had and just went a little too far ... dog in the drink.   I was really looking forward to bringing her to Lakair this June as I know she would have a blast with everyone, running around, just have a great time.     Appreciate the thought friends .... it's rather hard right now."

162884,Hookset,2008-02-21 22:20:00,367,"TREAT ME KINDLY  Treat me kindly, my beloved friend, For no heart in all the world is more rateful for kindness than the loving heart of me.  Do not break my spirit with a stick, For though I should lick your hand between blows, your patience and understanding will more quickly teach me the things you would have me learn.  Speak to me often, For your voice is the world's sweetest music, as you must know by the fierce wagging of my tail when your footsteps fall upon my ears.  Please take me inside when it is cold and wet, For I am a domesticated animal, no longer accustomed to the bitter elements. I ask no greater glory than the privilege of sitting at your feet beside the hearth.  Keep my pan filled with water, for I cannot tell you when I suffer thirst. Feed me clean food that I may stay well, to romp and play and do your bidding, to walk by your side, and stand ready, willing and able to protect you with my life, should your life be in danger.  And, my friend, when I am very old, and I no longer enjoy good health, hearing and good sight, do not make heroic efforts to keep me going.  I am not having fun. Please see that my trusting life is taken gently. I shall leave this earth knowing with the last breath I drew, that my fate was always safest in your hand.  --- By Beth Norman Harris 1968 ---"
