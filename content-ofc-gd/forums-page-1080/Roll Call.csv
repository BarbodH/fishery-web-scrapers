My hut is the big blue one ( black roof ) straight out from the boat launch, anyone needing to get out of the wind and warm up - doors unlocked. I should be up there around noon. This is a picture of the hut:   Please go in and warm up.    Don   It is off to the left in 80 fow"
163052,brickNblock,2008-02-22 12:46:00,598,"Mo... Very sorry to say that 'LilBrick an myself will not be comming afterall... It has been in the plans since last years and even marked in my daily diary. I am hosting one of my brothers 50th B-Day g2g'rs and had planned to bring everyone to Tyler's g2g for a great day on the ice for an even better cause BUT..... The majority ruled me out giving the BOQ the nod. Their reasoning was,  ""They didnt want to be around young folk and families"". I can only surmise it is so they can go 'HogWild'... I'm now (asof this past Tuesday) not bringing 'LilBrick either....she's P.O'd. Well THEY....are not avid fisherman either....... I'll have to lay the law down a litle out there and keep them in line.  Mo....I've your address from the year before..... If it's the same I'lll send my event donation regardless. If not the same address.PM me...K. Best of luck for a record raising amount for this great cause."
