162754,snag,2008-02-21 16:54:00,1932,enabler
162756,tbayboy,2008-02-21 17:01:00,1497,hehe.  Actually I didn't see too much there that really screamed MUST HAVE but I'm sure when I walk in the store I'll come up with something or other
162757,bucktail,2008-02-21 17:05:00,1857,Some good deals but the thing I noticed was not a single shimano product on  sale!!! Whats up with that?
162779,young_one,2008-02-21 17:53:00,620,thanx for the update! note to self: dont buy anything big
162780,gekhunter,2008-02-21 18:07:00,61,"thx, have had my eye on the Browning tackle bag and see it is 30% off..."
162782,Dano,2008-02-21 18:10:00,719,   Thanks TBB
162783,fishinggeek,2008-02-21 18:11:00,325,"It actually looks pretty good.  Thanks for posting it.  I usually find BPS sales to be more ""smoke and mirrors"", at least for the items I usually buy."
162785,LeXXington,2008-02-21 18:14:00,1928,Sean you had too post that didn't you  Some good deals.  Come on spring !!!!
162791,ccmtcanada,2008-02-21 18:22:00,7971,Thanks Sean...I took a look and I agree...nothing I MUST have.  I think it's a good thing that BPS is a good hour drive from home...I'd be broke if I lived within 15 minutes!!!
162797,Roy,2008-02-21 18:46:00,13728,Best deal in there is the Reefrunners at 5 for $20!!!! Can anyone please pick me up 15? The deep divers of course.
162798,tbayboy,2008-02-21 18:49:00,1497,I've got that bag (the 3600 version) and I like it though by the end of the season it was getting a little limp - rolls forward if the top is closed and its not full of weight.
162801,gekhunter,2008-02-21 18:59:00,61," good to know, thx, will take that into consideration.  Not easy with so many choices out there"
162808,taper,2008-02-21 19:17:00,611,Topic that has came up here a lot is the electric fillet knife. The cordless one on page 17 is a good deal and great for heading north with no hydro. I believe it is the same as mine and comes with two batteries and hard case.
162811,Fang,2008-02-21 19:21:00,1330,"Wow Extreme line of rods and reels at $59, great deal. This reel is the closest thing I've used comparing to a curado. 2 years ago I swapped a few old reels and picked up Extreme's. Great reels and looks like I'll have to add a couple more.  They sell a 200 size now in both LH and RH"
162907,Jigger,2008-02-21 23:26:00,1237,"Bucktail, you said it. No Shimano products? I was really hoping that they'd have a deal on the Stradic. Guess I'll have to get another T.Daiwa."
162908,Canuck2fan,2008-02-21 23:27:00,1444,"Looks like an easy visit on the wallet a couple or three of Pflueger Presidents, rain suit, 2 BPS Wally Marshall Pro Series Crappy Rods, 100 bucks or so on assorted tackle and line.... OH and if in moment of weakness might slip and grab a set of breathable waders. But for 70 bucks how can you go wrong even if they last a couple of seasons.  Thankfully my income tax return should be back soon LOL."
162912,Burtess,2008-02-21 23:36:00,901,I checked the prices on the Daiwa stuff and they are still higher than LeBaron's regular prices!!  You really have to watch what you buy!!  Remember to do your research....  Burt
162919,Canuck2fan,2008-02-21 23:52:00,1444, I agree with that.... Won't Lebarons also have their no tax event around the sportsmen show? Making their deals even sweeter and they will usually price match too won't they?
163012,urbanangler1990,2008-02-22 04:09:00,933,"i see this new baitcaster from quantum, the code, has anyone heard of this new reel, its a great price"
163019,maybe,2008-02-22 04:32:00,307,"Finally found the detailed seminar schedule.  I'm assuming ""Toyota Main Stage"" means the store's big fish tank.  Anyone know for sure?"
163041,Rich,2008-02-22 11:52:00,3927,Nice deal on the Extreme and the Reef Runners. That's enough to make me salivate.
163059,moemoe,2008-02-22 13:10:00,352,"I also like the dipseys for 20% off, have to talk the local shop first though,"
163070,Fang,2008-02-22 13:40:00,1330,"My flyer came in last night and noticed on the second read through the RIO fly lines 4,5 and 6wt for $10. Nice  I need a new 6 wt line for grayling this year. Can't weight. get it ha ha!"
