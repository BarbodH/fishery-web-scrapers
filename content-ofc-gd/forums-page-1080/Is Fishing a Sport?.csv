Join a club in your area, there are many all over Ontario and fish a small inexpensive club event.  It will give you a taste of what it's all about at a very friendly level.  The clubs are often dedicated to things beyond just tournament fishing, helping out with kids events and such is also a part of just about every club's mandate.  I'd be happy to recommend a club to anyone that is interested or wants to learn more.  I really think you'd be surprised.  Charles"

Sports commonly refer to activities where the physical capabilities of the competitor are the sole or primary determiner of the outcome (winning or losing), but the term is also used to include activities such as mind sports and motor sports where mental acuity or equipment quality are major factors.""...  Given this definition I have trouble seeing fishing as a sport.  However, the word itself is derived from an old French word, DESPORT, meaning leisure...If we go back to that meaning, then fishing is most certainly a sport.  Are pro fishermen athletes?  Most of the top Bass Pros look like they're in very good shape.  Slim young guys like Kevin Van Dam, Mike Iaconnelli, Skeet Reese, Gerald Swindle and Aaron Martens are the ones who've won Angler of the Year recently, and I hear them talking about how important that is to stay physically fit in order to be competitive at their level.  But does that make them Athletes?  Then again, I'm not sure that a lot of professional players are athletes either...grin.  In my opinion, Pro Sports have more in common with the WWF than the Olympics."
160232,charlesn,2008-02-13 19:10:00,551,There's one thing in common with every single person that claims top level bass tournament fishing is not a sport.  They haven't tried it at the higher levels where the serious money and thus serious commitment is involved.  I would encourage everyone who is answering it is not a sport to give it a try and then come back with your honest thoughts.  I think you'd be surprised at how wrong pre-conceived notions can be both about the sport and the ethics of the competitors.  Charles
160126,TOM C,2008-02-13 14:39:00,76,"You seem to be confusing what a Sport means, and what your interpretation of a sport is, A fishing tournament falls into all the catorgories that make it a sport, so you can argue the point that you dont think anglers are great atheletes or not, but tournament fishing is a sport as much as a baseball game or any other game your want to compare it with. So maybe the Question should be changed to, in your OPINION is fishing a sport. Because agian TOURNAMENT FISHING HAS ALL THE CRITERIA OF A SPORT.   I dont think a 400 pound lineman, because he,s fat enough not get pushed very far is an athelete, but thats just my opinion, because in reallity he,s called an athelete and meets the criteria to be called one"
160127,Terry,2008-02-13 14:40:00,14456,"and you can try to make fishing not a sport but the MNR the gov. and the DICTIONARY all call it a sport there are sport fish and course fish  ""Sport Fishing Licence: For anglers who want full catch and possession fishing privileges.

160145,Beats,2008-02-13 15:11:00,543,"I guess what I'm getting at is this.  Most of the people who are indeed calling fishing a sport are referring the naysayers to tournament pros as proof.  OK, but what % of ppl here saying this are themselves regular tournament fishers?  That's like calling driving to work a sport and when someone calls you on it referring them to Nascar drivers.    Forget the technical definition and actually evaluate a day (any day) of fishing that you do/have done and make a personal judgment for yourself if you really think you were involved in athletics.  I'm sure plenty of ppl on the board are true tournament fishermen.  I'm not doubting that at all.  Im just surprised that so many ppl who don't fish tournaments/competitively are still considering themselves athletes for their weekend fishing.  The real poll question should be ""Do you consider the fishing YOU DO to be a sport and YOURSELF an athlete"". I think the results would be a little more honest and realistic.  At least I would hope so.   People are calling it a sport based on a very tiny percentage of the fishing population that makes a living off of tournaments and who fish competitively compared to the massive numbers that do it for a past time.  If I go for a few km walk in the woods every weekend am I justified to tell people its a sport since it is a sport in the Olympics?  You definitely can't go off definition for this."

Most definitions in dictionaries online and off line classify sport as having 3 factors; it must be governed by a set of rules, it must rely on physical abilities, and it must be in engaged in competitively.  My thoughts: If you are fishing in a tournament, then yes definitely a sport. If you are out in the boat alone or with a bud, enjoying the day and competing against mother nature, then no not a sport.  Are pro tournament fishermen athletes? IMO absolutely Yes. I began fishing bass tournaments last year. Before that I would not have classified them as a sport, or pro tourney anglers as athletes. But now I do. It is as much a sport as golfing, bowling or racing."
