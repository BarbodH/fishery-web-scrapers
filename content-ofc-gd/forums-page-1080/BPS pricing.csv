Since I am heading down to Florida shortly, I thought I would do a comparison of the BPS flyer's for Canada and the Ft. Lauderdale store.  Amazingly, the prices for Canada, with a few exceptions, are either on par, or slightly lower than their advertised U.S. prices.  All I can say is ....... it is about time!  Good for them."

I just compared the Vaughn and Detroit flyers and I am not happy to see the HPR rains suits when you buy both pieces are 80.00 dollars cheapers in Detroit. Seems like the suppliers are doing their part but that BPS with their own stuff is still trying to maximize profits at our expense.... Everything else I was looking at though is within 10 dollars either way.  I guess the old adage it pays to shop around is true, even with the same company LOL"
