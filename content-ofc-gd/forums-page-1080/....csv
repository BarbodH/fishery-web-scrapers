162616,Daplumma,2008-02-21 02:30:00,1961,Was clearing out a fence row yesterday and found some green plants under the leaves and the swamp maple has red buds on it.Calling for snow Friday though. Joe

162660,Blue_Axela,2008-02-21 05:39:00,88,"Argh...I wish I could say the same her in Toronto.  As CCMT mentioned, we are under an extreme cold alert with temps dropping to -13C and -20C with windchill.  There is yet another snow storm forcasted to hit the GTA mid next week.  This winter seems like its never going to end...  I wouldn't be surprised if there was still snow out when I pick up my new/used boat in April!"

162781,Kirk,2008-02-21 18:09:00,347,certain SI issue is the early sign of spring for me
162821,Zib,2008-02-21 19:50:00,369,  Can't give up the better deer hunting & smallmouth fishing. The musky fishing in Lake St. Clair & the spring walleye run in the Detroit River would be hard to give up. Plus a Yankee like me wouldn't be too welcome down there.    I always did get some strange looks when I would stop on my drive down to Florida. Getting passed by a semi on the highway while I'm doing 85-90 mph is a like scary too.  If the economy in Michigan doesn't get better soon I may have to move down your way. Wouldn't be able to sell my house though.
162829,Smokey,2008-02-21 20:05:00,1278,Thanks for the peek into spring Glen. Think I'll drive down myself and have a look this weekend.  Mike
