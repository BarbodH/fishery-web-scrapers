161929,Greencoachdog,2008-02-19 13:58:00,8163,Great report and pics HH!!!  Does a frozen Wall-ice weigh more than one that's still alive?
161966,cranks bait,2008-02-19 15:50:00,721,"I am soooo jealous.  I was hoping to get out on the ice this weekend, as it just formed enough on Saturday to go out.  It was no good yesterday.  Two days of ice here and I never got out.  I know the smaller inland lakes are a bit better, but not much, but I do not know them, thus I won't go on them.  You are deffinately bringing in lots of fish there Hawg!  Again cuddos to your efforts and then teasing us afterwards."

162378,superdad,2008-02-20 14:35:00,353,"Way to go Hawg Hunter,  Saturday was a good day also at Hay Bay, not the numbers you posted up your way, but still a good day.  You're having awesome success - congrats  David  aka  Superdad"
162408,RandyB,2008-02-20 16:15:00,8,"Hey all ! Some of you may remember me from the Lakair G2G a few years ago , only then I was known as Cowpoke . I have to chime in and say THANK YOU to Hawg Hunter and his side kick Bill for sticking with me and finally getting it thru my sometime foggy head and putting me on some of those infamous BoQ walleyes . It did take me 2 tries , 1.5 cases of Canadian and 1 totaled SUV but they showed me how to do it . My first attempt resulted in the write off of my 2000 Pathfinder on the 401 coming around Toronto   but my traveling buddy had a great trip and while my fishing success was minimal Hawg and Bill tried so hard that I had to come back and try again a week later . Well , still no big one for me but the boys did perservre and I did manage to get a few keepers ! I can not say enough good things about Hawg and Bill . Those guys worked their butts off and in the end gave me one of my most memorable trips ever , I mean how can you carp about anything when your guides even pick you up at the front door of your hotel just to save you the risk of a DUI charge .    Randy ( Hawg ) and Bill not only have a combined 50 + years of experience but they also have that drive to make everyday fishing with them a great one ! In the end it was all worth the adventure thanks to those guys and if you ever get a chance to go with these guys run don't walk to meet them . Oh yeah there was no injuries in the wreck and all mason jars survived impact .   Cheers to all you fantastic OFC'ers and hope to see ya'll at Lakair this spring .  Randy (aka Cowpoke )"

162570,Mike the Pike,2008-02-21 00:26:00,3421,Nice Boq Report HH.Very nice sized fish.  What are the red spots on the walleyes?I caught the same kind of walleye in the spring the ones with Red spots went back in the drink.  Can anyone explain this
162579,Roy,2008-02-21 00:57:00,13728,"Great report, Hawg Hunter. Some really nice fish there for sure.  Mike, those spots are probably either dermal sarcoma or lymphocystis. Neither are a danger to humans ...they just are not very pretty."
162656,johnnyb,2008-02-21 04:31:00,3413,"Holy smokes those are some nice wallies!  So much good water to cover in Ontario....BOQ is another one that is on ""the list"".  And it looks like HH will be the go-to guy -- nice work!"
162675,mattyk,2008-02-21 11:50:00,2110,"great report, thanks for sharing."
163088,bramptonjerry,2008-02-22 14:34:00,132,"if regards to the red spots the picture taken with the tape measure were mine, they didn't have any spots when I caught them...just blood and eggs from flopping around together in the bucket"
