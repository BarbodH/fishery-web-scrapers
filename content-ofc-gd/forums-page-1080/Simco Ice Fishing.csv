163054,motion,2008-02-22 12:51:00,403,Hi all. I was thinking of taking a trip up to Simcoe Saturday with my boy for a day of perch fishing. I was out last year with Yellow Huts but I cant get a hold of them this year. Does anybody know if they are gone?  Can anyone suggest a good hut operator in Cooks Bay (reasonable rates)?  How has the perch fishing been?  Thanks in advance for your help.
