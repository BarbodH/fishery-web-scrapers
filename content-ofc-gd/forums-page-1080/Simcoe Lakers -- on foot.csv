Just started fishing the lake this year, and am enjoying the perch fishing, but I'd love to get out to some deeper waters. Am I dreaming, or should I start looking?"
162991,Sinker,2008-02-22 03:26:00,8692,"It can be done no prob, as long as  you are in decent shape, and don't mind a good hike.  There are spots where its not too far a walk up around barrie.....Big Bay Point or Bear Point. Innisfil beach is another decent spot I hear, but not as close as BBP or BP.  Just buck up and hike er' out there.....its not that far really. Takes about 30 mins to go 1.5 miles hauling all my gear.  Prime walking conditions right now too!!!  Sinker"
163029,johnnyb,2008-02-22 05:20:00,3413,"Thanks, Sinker I can certainly handle that....it's the kind of encouraging news I need to hear!  I will let you know if I'm going to try it....if you're free you should come along"
163038,rhare,2008-02-22 11:33:00,387,"As sinker said, lots of places to walk out many are only half a mile out. Fish are moving shallower now. Lots of guys fishing 40fow for whities. Me a the fellas I fish with almost always walk out and we've iced over 100 lakers this year, tightlines  Ryan"
163286,irishfield,2008-02-22 23:56:00,26272,Cripes John... take Jesse with you! She could catch one casting from shore this time of year! LOL
163310,camillj,2008-02-23 00:46:00,1988,You can walk out from the fish-for tyler event tomorrow and within a few hundred yards you're into lakers ...they're there ... now ... catching them is up to you
163319,Rustic-Fisher,2008-02-23 01:03:00,826,"If your walking try anywhere in Kempenfelt Bay on the South side. ie Bear point, Big bay point ect.. This area of the Lake drops quickly and you will have no problem finding deeper water. Think 100' plus  RF"
163333,Casey123,2008-02-23 01:23:00,461,"Always do really well out of Innisfil Beach, about 25 minute walk to where we fish.  That is pulling a portable hut and gear."
