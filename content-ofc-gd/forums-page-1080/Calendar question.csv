162946,bucktail,2008-02-22 01:21:00,1857,This year is a leap year so we get an extra day in February.  One question...... WHO WAS THE TOOL THAT PICKED FEBRUARY!!!!!! Couldnt have stuck it on July or Septmeber but the worst month of the year. I am sick of Febrauary already! MY rant is over now back to the hockey game.

163115,Terry,2008-02-22 15:33:00,14456,so you want Feb. to have 30 days for now on and July have 28 days every year but on the 4th year we have 29 days in July
