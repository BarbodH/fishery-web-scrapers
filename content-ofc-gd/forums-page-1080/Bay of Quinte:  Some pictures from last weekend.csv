163016,Ben_Daniels,2008-02-22 04:16:00,435,Nice fish....amazing pics...what kind of Camera are you using?
163107,Jeff_C,2008-02-22 15:18:00,50," I have two cameras depending on the day and if I even bring either of them.  I have a Canon Digital SLR and a Point and Shoot.  I love the SLR, although all of these were taken with the Point and Shoot as the conditions weren't going to be great so I didn't bring the SLR out.  Perhaps this weekend I will.  Jeff"
