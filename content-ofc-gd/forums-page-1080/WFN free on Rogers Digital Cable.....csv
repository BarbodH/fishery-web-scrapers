You have to order the ultimate sports pack or something like that for $10 a month, but its free for 3 months.  So if anyone has rogers and likes to watch fishing, you have nothing to loose.  Just thought I would let everyone know..."
163298,gekhunter,2008-02-23 00:20:00,61,thanks for the heads up.  I check every once in awhile cause it was free for about 6 months last year.  I would subscribe but get tired of the saltwater fishing and european carp tournaments.
