163493,BillM,2008-02-23 16:54:00,17367,"Anyone have any thoughts on the Abu Garcia C4 that's in the new Bass Pro flyer?  I am trying to piece together a muskie setup for next season and was thinking it would be a good option.  I just need something for the occasional muskie day, casting some jerkbaits, spinners etc...."
163497,mattyk,2008-02-23 16:59:00,2110,"BillM, i would go with the C3 over the C4 because of the lower gear ratio which gives you more power for reeling in those bigger baits especially those with big blades."
163500,Weeds,2008-02-23 17:01:00,782,I suggested the same thing and spent a fair bit of time researching the C4 last night. Seems like mixed reviews. Looks like quite a few folks out there use it for muskyfishing jerkbaits and glidebaits due to the fast retrieve. Some people report that the gears wear out if trying to crank in large bucktails. This is the reel Rich is replacing; it just seems like such a sweet deal for the cash.
163503,BillM,2008-02-23 17:06:00,17367,"mattyk: Appreciate the advice!!  Finally tied into my first muskie last year during a trip with the oldman to the French, a monster 14incher    Thought I'd get a bit more serious this season and put some dedicated days in.   Hopefully I'll get a chance to tag along with a few OFC'ers this year and see what kind of hell I am in for"
162277,Rich,2008-02-20 04:24:00,3927,"After weighing my options over my next musky reel I decided to spend the extra couple bucks and go for a Shimano Cardiff. All I read were good reviews from other fishermen, but they were mostly bass guys. I see a lot of musky guys using them so I figured it's a safe bet. Anyone else here use them? Would like to hear if I made a good investment for this season."
162283,johnnyb,2008-02-20 04:47:00,3413,"My good buddy uses the Cardiff for Musky -- I believe it replaced my model, the Corsair, and well...I think I like the Cardiff just a tad better!  Go for it!"
162291,bassmastermike,2008-02-20 05:29:00,295,Great Choice!!!
162307,nofrills,2008-02-20 10:20:00,89,"Funny, I've heard the exact opposite. Plastic gearing inside can lead to issues."
162309,Roy,2008-02-20 10:28:00,13728,"Rich, I think you should look around for a better option. While the Cardiff is a decent reel, it certainly isn't your best choice for a muskie reel. I assume you'll mostly be casting ...or?"
162314,mattyk,2008-02-20 11:10:00,2110,I've got an  abu c3 6500 and a calcutta 400 which are both pretty decent musky reals and i would recommend. I haven't heard any thing about the cardiffs.
162358,mistyriver1,2008-02-20 13:59:00,600,I've got one Rich.  One season with it so far and no complaints.
162394,Steve,2008-02-20 15:21:00,2075,"dont use it in below zero temperatures....  it'll get wet, then expand, and freeze...normally, not a problem on high end reels...the cardiff is not seeled 100%, so the moisture will freeze...."
162439,bigbuck,2008-02-20 17:25:00,2449,"That's what warranties are for! For the dough, it's not bad, what about an Abu?? Did you look at them?? A nice 6500C3 is about the same money if I'm not mistaken, do your homework and it depends on how much you plan on using it. My next muskie reel will be the Daiwa Luna or the St Croix which is the same thing just re-badged, I saw it at the fishing show and reelly (ha ha) liked it but have to save a few pennies before I drop $300 on a reel."
162441,bigbuck,2008-02-20 17:27:00,2449,"Oh yeah, I forgot, you can pick up a Pete Maina combo at Bass Pro for $149.99!! That's a steal, it's like getting the rod for 20 bucks. You can't go wrong with that."
162509,mepps,2008-02-20 20:56:00,1301,"Hon picked up a Cardiff a few years back when I got a Calcutta. His reel is doign better then mine right now (although I used mine WAY more, and in saltwater)  Despite being plastic inside, its a solid reel and outcasts my Calcutta, plus it has a fast retireve."
162511,aplumma,2008-02-20 21:03:00,6896,The cardiff reel if you get it the 400A series is a better than the 300 series. The reel has been redesigned at the end of 2007 so be sure it is not old stock .   Art
162530,glen,2008-02-20 22:24:00,2641,Rich i got one a few months ago but i have not used it yet.  I got the 401 cause its left hand.  I like the thumb bar better then the abu's but it is plastic. The first reel cabela's shipped had a broken thumb bar. I am going to use 65lb braid on it to cast lures 2oz and less for muskie.  I am not planning on trolling with it.  I put some line on it just to test the reel.   The drag dosn't have very fine adjustments but it is ok for muskie. It is smooth when you turn the handle.  The drag is very smooth also.  If you don't need a left hand reel there are lots of other options.  But for left hand this is the one.
162541,Zib,2008-02-20 23:02:00,369,"Is the drag power rating going to make much difference? I notice that the Cardiff has a drag power rating of 10 lbs, where as other popular musky reels like the C3, C4 & Record have 22 lbs, 17lbs, & 17-22 lbs.  I'm looking into a new musky casting reel myself & have been thinking about getting the Abu Garcia Record. I'm going to do the BPS reel trade-in for $25 off plus a $15 rebate. Shimano isn't participating in the reel trade-in in the US."
162695,Crazyhook,2008-02-21 13:17:00,1154,"Rich if its like the Corsair.. do not buy it! I had a high 40"" fish hit a bait beside the boat with a tight drag and the reel exploded.."
162722,mattyk,2008-02-21 14:40:00,2110,i had a corsair and it was a piece of crap. Crazyhook is right about that!
162738,Crazyhook,2008-02-21 15:53:00,1154,I am going to be picking up a PENN 965 for this season
162925,mistaredone,2008-02-22 00:11:00,913,I did alot of reserch last month looking for a musky reel between $100-$350 and decided on the Abu C3 65001 It seemed the best for the price at $125 and all the hard core musky guys i have talked to say its a work horse.  Maina only has right handed reels or I would also consider them.
163011,Crazyhook,2008-02-22 04:06:00,1154,Abu a work horse? they are good reels but if you use them alot they do burn out quite fast IMO
163013,mepps,2008-02-22 04:12:00,1301,"The reel exploded?!  Wish I oculd have seen that!  On a side note, I got in teh habit if using my thumb alot rather then relying on the drag. Those pesky tarpon destroyed the drag on my Calcutta.  You want you drag to last longer, losen it up, especially when you have a fish near the boat."
163025,Crazyhook,2008-02-22 04:59:00,1154,"thumb is good for sure...  those damn tarpon eh CLive, hope I have the same problems with them"
163027,Weeds,2008-02-22 05:13:00,782,"I've got a C3 and really like it but I notice that the C4 will be on sale at Bass Pro in a few days. It's pretty seriously reduced with about 50 bucks off plus a 15 dollar mail in rebate plus the 10-15 dollar coupon you get if you do the reel trade in thing. I'm guessing after tax might work out to around 80ish dollars for the 6601 reel. High speed reel (relatively, 6.3-1) with line recovery of 30 inches a turn. Tempted to grab one myself. Not sure if they are as well suited to musky fishing as the C3 though........Somebody else know?"
163040,Rich,2008-02-22 11:36:00,3927,The reel I'm replacing is an Abu C4. Was a great reel but it was the clutch for the thumb bar that went loose and after fixing it before every trip it finally just gave out last time out in the season.
163067,goteeboy,2008-02-22 13:30:00,175,my bro recently got two cardiffs on ebay and they look a bit cheap in their craftmanship. too much of that plasticky graphite and not enough aluminum. i'd go w/ a used calcutta any day.
163196,Jason Vernooy,2008-02-22 20:17:00,25,But two Maina...4;2 and 5 series......then you need to rods......
