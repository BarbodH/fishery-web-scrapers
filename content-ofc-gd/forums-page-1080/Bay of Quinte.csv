Thinking of hitting the Belleville area and wondered where I might find some bait in the wee hours of the morning.  Also wondering about the ice conditions and where to avoid. If any fellow OFNer's will be out there, keep an eye open for they green polaris and clam, I'll be wearing a blue and black ice rider jacket.   Feel free to PM if you prefer.  Thanks"

163168,duber,2008-02-22 18:37:00,220,Sam will also have some info for you as to were the bite is on.I would give you some info but you can catch almost as many walleye in your livingroom as I have caught this year.I did hear the bite was good out off the George Street boatramp in Belleville and I see lots of people out there but I have not been out there yet.  Good luck
