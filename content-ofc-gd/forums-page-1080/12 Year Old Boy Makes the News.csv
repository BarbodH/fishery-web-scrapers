162913,TennesseeGuy,2008-02-21 23:36:00,957,"Earlier this week we had a five page thread involving a 14 year old boy.  Here's part of a news story in my local paper the same day about a 12 year old who lives about 15 miles up the road from my city.  Here's most of the article that was in the Cookeville, TN., Herald-Citizen newspaper February 19, 2008..........................  ""Twelve-year-old Cole Presley is being called a hero after saving his grandfather's life on a farm between Rickman and Livingston last Friday afternoon.  The boy's quick thinking kept an angry bull from goring Aubrey Maurice Presley, 75, to death in a field where Presley had gone to tend to cattle, according to Overton County Sheriff W.B. Melton.  ""Mr. Presley was out there in the field when this 1,400 pound Angus bull started butting him and knocked him down and even fell on him at one point,"" said Deputy Sgt. Donathan Durham.  The boy, who was outside the pasture's fence, reacted quickly when he saw what was happening.  First he sent his younger sister, Jordan, to the house to call their parents.  Then he jumped into his grandfather's Chevy pickup, drove it into the pasture, and used it to bump the bull away, the deputy said.  The bull kept attacking, even butting the truck and making large dents in the metal, he said.  ""But the boy managed to get the truck between his grandfather nad the bull and then he jumped out and got his grandfather into the truck and drove out of there.""  Once outside the fenced area, the boy called 911, and soon help was on the way.  Deputy Sgt. Durham, along with Deputies Sean Alred and Tom Key, were dispatched to the scene.  When they arrived, paramedics from the Overton County Ambulance Service were already there treating Presley for his injuries, which included several broken ribs.  A helicopter ambulance was brought into the farm and took Pressley to Erlanger Hospital in Chattanooga, where he remained yesterday, St. Durham said.  ""He is expected to recover.  He was able to talk to us at the scene when we got there.  One of his family members was asking that the bull be shot, but Mr. Presley said no, said he would get rid of it, but he didn't want it shot.""  Sgt. Durham said Cole Presley is definitely a hero.  ""If it had not been for him, his grandfather would have been killed,"" Durham said.  Cole is the son of Kevin and Stephanie Presley, and Kevin is the son of Aubrey Maurice Presley."""
