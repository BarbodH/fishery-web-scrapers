161704,Rich,2008-02-18 22:40:00,3927,"I've tinkered with many different ways of storing musky lures since tackle boxes don't exist large enough to carry these baits properly. I've stuffed them in boxes which results in hook tangles, hung them on buckets, more tangles and baits fell out, drilled holes in the top of the bucket which helped a bit, but the baits were still so close together they hung up all the time. Very frustrating. Well it looks like I finally have a solution this year.    A milk crate and some coat hangers. Plenty of room for the baits, less tangle and I even categorized them into sections. Of course by the end of this year I will probably need 2 more milk crates for all the other muskie junk I will buy. lol But it works."

161711,Pigeontroller,2008-02-18 22:47:00,2793,"Rich, you can also get vinyl eavestrough downspout from Home Depot, its about $10 for a 10 foot piece, cut it to 10"" or 12"" pieces and they fit nicely in a milk crate."
161713,Mike Pike,2008-02-18 22:48:00,1332,Milk crates.  Is there anything they CAN'T do?
161714,Rizzo,2008-02-18 22:49:00,4754,"I currently use a very deep rubbermaid with holes drilled around the top, works for me...but I do have a milk crate in the back room, may need to modify it too"
161753,GbayGiant,2008-02-19 00:03:00,1780,"Yup, 20 feet of downspout fit snug and will last a lifetime and even drain and dry your baits perfectly. The coat-hangers are a good idea too, you basically got yourself a free set-up.     This one has 25 pieces. I think theres two standard sizes of crates but either way you can see it's a good cheap storage.  For spinnerbaits you can just cut slots and use 2 side by side holes."
161757,ecxstriper,2008-02-19 00:08:00,343,Here are some nice DIY plug storeage systems . I didn't male these I found them on the surf fishing site I go to. frist one is a bit complicated but still pretty cool . Empty    Loaded up   And the next one is actually my favorite    I have more detailed pics on the last ones construction just pm me and I'll send them off to you .
161762,lew,2008-02-19 00:32:00,12767,Another cheap method is to stick them in an old duffle bag with some downspout    or in your livewell if you don't keep any fish    or hang them from your console    or the bow of your boat    or build a big box       Lotsa cheap ways to store them
161840,bigbuck,2008-02-19 02:49:00,2449,"Lew, you don't fish much for musky do ya??? LOL!!"
161931,jnic,2008-02-19 14:25:00,158,i have a tckle box for sale. don't fish musky any more. if your in the ottawa area.
162111,mepps,2008-02-19 21:20:00,1301,great ideas guys!
162143,ccmtcanada,2008-02-19 22:39:00,7971,Awesome ideas here!  I'll have to keep them in mind.
163073,goteeboy,2008-02-22 13:49:00,175,"my bro made up a storage system for muskie lures. same milk crate, but he took a 4-5 inch diameter pvc pipe and cut several pieces to the height of the crate and created a sort of 'honeycomb' like thing, and he used adhesive to glue them together. so you can always take out the pvc pieces and clean out the bottom of the crate.  oh and he put a piece of screen mesh on the bottom so nothing falls through.  here's a pic "
163086,LeXXington,2008-02-22 14:32:00,1928,Great idea's. poor tackle box old and outdated
163114,Raf,2008-02-22 15:32:00,3495,"One thing you guys may want to consider is having some type of a lid for your boxes.  The UV rays from the sun will eat away at the finish / colour of your lures - a lot quicker than you may think.  Particularly with bootails.  I've a few that have faded because of that.  btw, I use a simple recycling bin for the larger lures and double thick plano trays for the smaller stuff."
163122,mattyk,2008-02-22 15:54:00,2110,some great posts and ideas here.
163136,Crazyhook,2008-02-22 16:30:00,1154,hey Lew did I accidently drop the black and orange one!  
163159,lew,2008-02-22 17:38:00,12767,You weren't sposed to see that one Jamie
163178,fishnsled,2008-02-22 19:22:00,3520,Excellent ideas!    I've got an old sheet of plexiglass that I think I just found some use for it.
