162452,KyleM,2008-02-20 17:57:00,218,Im in for sure.  Im the Dirty Mitts
162454,KyleM,2008-02-20 18:02:00,218,The draft is tommorrow......holy crap better take the rest of the day off  Did you leave the sign up open so that it will fill up??
162483,Tinman,2008-02-20 19:26:00,376,"its open, if you know of anyone there are 4 spots left, i can add more if more want to join"
162515,bucketmouthjohnny,2008-02-20 21:22:00,115,"I'm in, not sure if can make live draft but will try, if not, may the auto pick be my saviour."

162787,Tinman,2008-02-21 18:16:00,376,"Last Call! Draft is live tonite, 5 more spots open"
162877,cthewrld,2008-02-21 22:05:00,99,"I won't be able to participate in the actual draft.  I have made my picks, and saved them.  Do I still need to log-in, or will my picks be made for me automatically?  Thanks,  Michael"
162893,Tinman,2008-02-21 22:34:00,376,your pics will be made for you base on your rankings and what the yahoo rankings are. It happened to me last year and i ended up in third in a football pool
162901,KyleM,2008-02-21 23:06:00,218,"Did you make out a list or are you going into autodraft?  To me, auto drafting takes the fun out of it."
162927,Tinman,2008-02-22 00:20:00,376,"you can actually make your own list, but whether those players are available is another story, if you aren't there it drafts automatically, otherwise you pick yourself"
162938,fishing n autograph,2008-02-22 00:57:00,2540,Why is no one picking???? I've been waiting a half an hour and not one pick...what's goin on???
163021,KyleM,2008-02-22 04:38:00,218,"Your all going down.  Good luck, yall will need it."
