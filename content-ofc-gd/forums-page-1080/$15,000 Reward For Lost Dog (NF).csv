Huckleberry Hound Returned Monday February 18, 2008                 CityNews.ca Staff                                                               Whether it was the promise of a lucrative reward or the goodness in the abductor's heart, a stolen dog has been reunited with its joyful owner.  Bert Clark had put up a 15 thousand dollar reward for the Chocolate Lab he called his soulmate. ""Huckleberry is my family,"" Clark said, shortly after the pet went missing from a café on Yonge Street near Roxborough. The loss was ""devastating.""  Clark can sleep easy now, as his Huckleberry friend is safe at home. And so can the person who returned the beloved pet. As promised, Clark paid up.  http://www.citynews.ca/news/news_19708.aspx   "

Guess I should have held that dodge ignition key ransom, that I picked up out of the snow today at CTC, instead of handing it to the courtesy desk for free."
162158,Tarzan's Jane,2008-02-19 23:21:00,1183,Did he intend on stealing the dog or did he come to it's rescue?  Was the dog abandoned for a considerable length of time?  Did he in fact get the money?  Or was this a little mid-winter scam two friends put together to pass the time. I need a holiday.

162204,irishfield,2008-02-20 01:10:00,26272,The year before I had to put my Lab down he was getting a tad alzheimeristic @ 13 yr old. He swam over to our neighbours island that rents the place out. Dispite the fact that he had a luggage tag on his collar with phone number..island address etc so people would return him when he forgot where he was......They fed him hot dogs...took him in for the night letting him sleep on their kids bed. They even held the dog back in the trees when my wife went by in the boat by calling the dogs name. Second time by she spotted him and asked them WTH. She brought him back and the next day... which was check out morning for the renter... they were 10 feet off the side of our island with hot dogs calling the dog and trying to get him to come to them. Suspect they were going to dognap him. Great for a dog that was on thyroid pills.. to say the least.

162280,Rizzo,2008-02-20 04:33:00,4754," I agree.  I understand people really love their pets, but a $5000 reward would've gotten you the same result (except you'd have 10,000 more in your account).  We had friends who did the same thing.  Lost a cat and put up  1000.00 reward posters around.  Turned out the cat had gone in their neighbour's house...and the neighbours actually took the reward money!!!  A 50.00 reward would've done the job!"

I might not however take $50 from a lady who lost her cat, but this guy - it would be my pleasure."
