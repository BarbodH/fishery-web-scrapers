I will be bringing my 4-wheeler just wondering how the ice is and the thickness out from the park, I haven't been to Simcoe yet this year and I want to be safe out there. Is the ice safe for a 4-wheeler out there?  Thanks in advance  Jay"

162961,Sinker,2008-02-22 02:13:00,8692,"I measured 19"" off JP today......conditions are great. All that snow/slush has formed into nice ice. Perfect conditions for a quad.....a little bumpy/hard for sleds, just enough snow for the sliders.  Have fun guys!!  Sinker"
