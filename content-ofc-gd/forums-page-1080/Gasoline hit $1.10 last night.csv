162555,danc,2008-02-20 23:50:00,4677,$1.15 on my way home from work tonight. I paid .88 this morning with the help of Sis's magic card.
162590,mattyk,2008-02-21 01:39:00,2110,"its upto 3.20 a gallon here in Louisville which works out to about 0.82 cents a liter, that is pretty expensive for here."
162597,Cookslav,2008-02-21 01:58:00,1457,"Yup $1.10 tonight in K-town Its crap but, we all know theres nothing we can do...kinda frustrating, but whats a boy to do?"
162661,Hooked,2008-02-21 05:44:00,891,"I was pretty ticked when I saw the gas hit 105 over night earlier this week, now, overnight again up to 109.6, then I was really ticked, especially now that I needed to fill-up!  I just don't get it, I really don't, and I refuse to, cuz I don't think there is anything logical to get!"
162690,holdfast,2008-02-21 12:53:00,1813,"I understand exactly where your coming from.  Here in Sask at least in N Battleford gas has held on to 1.06 A month ago it was the same despite going 100 dollars a barrel.  It went down by 10 dollars still the same.  It rose 100 dollars a barrel a couple days ago and we are told its going up at the pumps.  So there is some sanity here by not raising every time some Dick says its going up overnight in the cloak of darkness.  But its still going up even though its the same per barrel as last month.  Now for my own experience in Angus outside of Barrie in 2006 you know, when every time there was a storm or weekend gas went up.  I commuted to/from Wasaga to Angus every day and watched the 3 gas stations take advantage of the Military traffic going in and out of Base.  Gas went up Thurs, down on Tuesday, they were 3 cents more than Wasaga and all points in between.  One would raise , two would follow suit immediately, one would lower two would take their time.  Now here's when I lost it.  Its noon and I hear on the Radio that TO is Raising prices by 10 cents.  I rush to the gas station in Angus and one station says they're  empty, and the other I have to wait in line for an hour.  I get my gas for that Days rate and the attendant, stops traffic behind me and raises the price 15 cents.  I says to him what is the deal here, gas hasnt changed underground.  He says he just got a call to Raise the price from his district manager.  I call him a flapping lier as I watched him fuel cars like a bat out of hell ( Manager owner of that station) anyways, found out that  the raise in price was only a rumour.  The gas stations took 3 Days to lower to a higher price previous of the Rumour mill.  I watched those suckers raise prices in late in the morning to take advantage of afternoon traffic going off base.  There is a problem and its called NO CONTROL, GOV WILL NOT STEP IN so there is gas Gouging"
162696,Cookslav,2008-02-21 13:19:00,1457, Don't forget to Ride as close as possible to the back of the next vehicle infront of you to take advantage of their draft. (Transports are particularily good for that) 
162697,lew,2008-02-21 13:19:00,12767,"I had to go out to Kingston yesterday morning and the prices there ranged anywhere from $1.04  - $1.10, then when I got back to Toronto, I saw one ESSO station selling it for $1.01 while the radio reported some stations in the GTA were as much as $1.14  Seems to me as if some of these guys are just charging whatever the heck they feel they can get away with."
162711,Cookslav,2008-02-21 13:52:00,1457,"Yup.... It drives me nuts, but its better for my health to let it go. There is no happy news when it comes to Gas. We all know they gauge us at the pumps, and they say the oils dwindling, and production is down and    yadda Yadda.....then post record profits, just like the insurance companies. Considering Canada has the second 2 largest deposits of oil that has barely been begun to be tapped these last 10 years I just don't beleive there is a shortage right now. Will we run out eventually....yes so sure go ahead raise it a bit, conserve(but triple the cost????) Is production slowed down....yes but its because OPEC decided they need more money(which is annoying)  All I can say is I Can't wait to see affordable electrics that can tow LOL.... I wish there was a way to stick it to them but at the end of the day, even if we ran out, those sots at OPEC will already have been made billionaires 10 time over.  Bah...there goes my blood pressure again"
162837,outllaw,2008-02-21 20:20:00,1232,"the days of 20 cents per gallon,,, yep you read it right. hemi cudas 454 chevies are gone. gas you want some eat more beans or cabbage. oh ya it takes more cabbage now to eat beans. i guess ya just cant win... funny though how the u.s. controls the greater part of canadian reserves?"
162926,mepps,2008-02-22 00:19:00,1301,"I havent seen it at 1.10 in months.  We are in teh 1.11-1.19 range here in Halifax usually, and expecting a spike for tomorrow.  I just waited in line for 15 minutes to fill her up today, luckily I drive a small Civic and I dont use too much gas.  The guy ahead of me put $130 into his pickup!!!"
162930,Cookslav,2008-02-22 00:29:00,1457,"Ya...with my 3rd little one on the way(all 3 Will be in Car seats) My options were Mini Van, and SUV  Both fill up at $90-100/tank But the Min vans tank lasts considerably longer....  Yup I'm a mini van guy now LOL!"
162323,lew,2008-02-20 11:51:00,12767,Guess the gas companies are gradually pushing us towards the record high retail prices they promised us for this coming summer season.
162324,Greencoachdog,2008-02-20 12:00:00,8163,"The prices ""Yo-Yo"" down here between midweek and weekend, with weekend being the higher of the two."
162325,Roy,2008-02-20 12:02:00,13728,"It hit $1.24 in Montreal on Monday, Lew. I fueled both vehicles at $1.10 yesterday."
162337,Tdel,2008-02-20 12:46:00,393,Heard on the news ...... oil fire in Texas.  OPEC decided not to increase oil production to cover shortage therefore price goes up.  Tom.
162339,OhioFisherman,2008-02-20 13:05:00,6623,"Oil went over 100 a barrel for the first time. I don`t know how much damage was done to the refinery, but a shortage of refining capacity also. Oil is not much use to the consumers until it is refined to gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil."
162344,aniceguy,2008-02-20 13:18:00,1094,guess my post was deleted as it was too contraversial
162352,Cookslav,2008-02-20 13:38:00,1457,"Filled up last night at a 1.01/L in Kitchener...on my way home I saw 3 stations ranging from 1.05 to 1.08 so I promplty stopped at the Macs who was abviously behind in changing the sign  or so I thought....  Of course the line up started right after I paid.... Funny part was when I mentioned it to the clerk, he grumbled somthing about the sign not working so he couldn't change it LOL!!!  I'm gonna take the wifes car to work and see if they ""fixed"" the sign yet"
162354,Greencoachdog,2008-02-20 13:41:00,8163, Why don't you talk about your own country's politics?... on a different forum.
162372,Roy,2008-02-20 14:19:00,13728,"Sorry luis, it's called flaming."
162375,aniceguy,2008-02-20 14:28:00,1094,I dont view it that way Roy... but I dont have the delete button so we will have to agree to disagree and thats about it
162382,Canuck2fan,2008-02-20 14:42:00,1444,"I like how a member of parliament was able to warn us that this was going to happen.  Dan McTeague put out a press release early yesterday telling everyone exactly what was going occur, and it seems he was pretty accurate too. Yet the federal government say they are powerless to stop goughing like this. It is nothing but pure and simple greed on the part of the OIL COMPANIES.... Charging us comsumers more today for an increase they won't even feel until the oil they buy at the new price is refined in 6 weeks ought to be a crime. The ones behind it, the oil execs and wall street speculators should treated the same way profiteers and looters are in any natural disaster..... Instead they get more stock options and promotions."
162413,holdfast,2008-02-20 16:37:00,1813,"Here's another Good one, the BC Government just announced they will raise the price of Gas 2-3 cents in the name of the Global Warming threat, up to five cents within the next couple of years.  Its called an environmental tax, intended on curbing travel because it will cost you more.  What a Spineless way of Weaseling out of government punishing the big companies but put it on the tax payer.  Watch and see other provinces, even the Feds do the same thing to cover their Chicken arses"
162415,blizzcat,2008-02-20 16:40:00,92,brutal. i am not looking forward to this summers gas bills.
162419,LeXXington,2008-02-20 16:48:00,1928,"Gas is like crack, once you use it you can't stand life without it, soon the dealers raise the price a little, you buy the same, raise it a little more you still buy... and on it goes  Remember the days when 59.9 was expensive!!!  Thanks, India, china, USA, CANADA name you country its there fault.  Fact is engine's should be more fuel effieciant, We should have been looking at more way's to get off oil 50 years ago after the WWII cause they learned then what happens when you don't have enough fuel.  Oh well, next decade will be intresting.. Thank you Canada Fed goverement for not lowering the taxes on gas and your great surplus  Wonder if you can tow a boat with a Moped?"
162420,Carp,2008-02-20 16:57:00,1488,"Hey Lex,  It'll probably be cheaper to drive the moped to the lake and just rent a boat. Carrying tackle may be a challenge though."
162424,cityfisher,2008-02-20 17:01:00,959,front and jarvis .... 109.4 .. YIPPPPY ...luckly i take the go train to work
162433,KyleM,2008-02-20 17:14:00,218,Ive been paying 1.15 since August.  I drive a 4 banger so its not a big deal but.....   BRING ON the tar sands LOL
162435,bigbuck,2008-02-20 17:18:00,2449,"I filled up last night for $1.056, I heard Dan McTeauge on the radio yesterday and having heard that oil broke through a hundred bucks, I knew we were in for $1.10. If you know your numbers, you can figure out roughly within a cent or two as to how much it will cost. If our loonie pops up a bit, it will relieve the price of gas but that isn't too likely, the Bank of Canada is leaning towards another interest rate cut next month so the loonie is not too attractive to foreign investors. Sucks to be us!!! I guess the price of fuel is going to force all the owners of old 2 strokes to retire them or not run them too much because of their lousy fuel economy."
162442,Carp,2008-02-20 17:33:00,1488,"More and more people will be looking for work close to home, or buying homes close to work, in order to save the fuel costs.  I know a large company that was based in north east Toronto (Scarborough) and moved their operations to Kitchener, ON. Most of the employees couldn't afford the long drive to work on minimum wage and would have surely quit if they were forced to commute. Lots of minimum wage jobs close to home. It was cheaper for the company to buy a bus and transport everyone back and forth than increase wages to attract qualified people in the Kitchener area."
162443,Guest lundboy,2008-02-20 17:41:00,0," Why lower the taxes on fuel?  If they did, the municpalities would put a tax on, and the oil companies would just increase their share and suck up the tax savings."
162501,Greencoachdog,2008-02-20 20:41:00,8163,I look at it this way. The 50 h.p. Merc gets a helluva lot better gas mileage than the 5.4L truck motor... so i'll be doing more   than driving this year!
162506,Riparian,2008-02-20 20:46:00,269,"As the world runs out of oil, (and we will run out of oil) we as a society will be forced to adapt and find other sources of energy. I for one am looking forward to it.  Until then, you can combat raising gasoline prices by finding other alternitive methods of transportation."
162507,walleyejigger,2008-02-20 20:47:00,876,$1.11 here in chemmy
