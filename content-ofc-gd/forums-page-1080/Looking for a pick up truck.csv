162407,cranks bait,2008-02-20 16:14:00,721," This was another reason I bought my Honda in Brockville.  It was built in Ontario, go figure?  I also forgot to mention that my truck has 40 000 kms on it and has been in the shop only for oil changes.  No I do not do it myself, I'd rather spend that time fishing.  Yes it has a short bed.  I do not carry 8 feet of lumber everyday nor do I carry a sled or motorized bike, so I do not need the long bed.  It can easily hold a bike though as the Honda tailgate is built to support that weight.  I have now drivin this other (Ram 1500 quad) truck long enough to get a comparison on gas.  It uses twice as much as my Honda.  No joke here.  It is brutal driving and watching the guage go down.  I cannot believe the difference in it.  Don't be scared of the Honda.  Just because it's not one of the BIG BOYS doesn't mean it doesn't compare."

162447,FUSION,2008-02-20 17:46:00,81, How you can call a Honda Pilot with a quote un-quote pick-up body on it a truck I will never know or be able to understand and of course the fuel milage is better with the Honda it's half the size of the ram and has a mini van engine in it.http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/style_emoticons/default/wallbash.gif http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/style_e...lt/wallbash.gif What makes a truck a truck is how its engineered from the ground up not the fact there's a bed in the back and yes your Honda was built in Orangeville but your money went overseas.
162470,cranks bait,2008-02-20 18:54:00,721,"True the money went overseas, but the people who built it live here, the taxes for that building were paid here, thus I still helped the canadian economy.  Yes it is smaller than a Ram on the outside, but there is actually more room on the inside.  Just because it is a truck does not mean that it has to be 8 feet in the air and 30 feet long.  For the record I do not know the exact measurments so I know I am wrong here.  All in all there is not that much difference in size, but there is in consumption.  I will admit the Dodge has a Hemi.  Woo hoo, so I can spin my wheels.  Really good too.  To get out of my driveway the Dodge spins, whereas the Honda crawls right out.  Even in 4wd I feel the Honda has a better grab on the road and uses it's smaller power more efficiently.  Like I said, I do not hawl big things, nor do I carry big things in the bed, so why would I buy stuff I don't need?    I have never felt underpowered in this truck.  I also like the fact that I don't need a stool to get into it.  Although the dash is not big enough to fit a cowboy hat, but that's ok by me.  Like I said, try it you just might like it."
162480,Weeds,2008-02-20 19:15:00,782,"  You've got a really North American based perspective of what constitutes a pick up truck. Monstrous engine, huge box and towering ride height. Engine size is pretty much irevelant; gearing is what counts. Sure a Hemi engine spits out gobs of power and torque. When is the last time you saw anybody using it? Turn on the news, watch what people are driving in Iraq, Afghanistan, Africa, South America, Australia, wherever. Small trucks, small dispalcement engines (often diesels) and almost Never American. Good examples of trucks being used as trucks.  Speaking of excessivly powered engines, when is the last time anybody witnessed a real good burnout? You'd figure with all these high powered vehicles rolling off the line these days folks would be laying a little more rubber. Back a few years when I had my fun cars (77 camaro, supra turbo ) I use to peel out all the time. What's wrong with kids today?"
162489,FUSION,2008-02-20 20:08:00,81," I am sorry, I do not know what perspective you want me to have??? One of whats been getting work done here for the last 50+ years or the one of the worst selling ""truck"" on the market thats still on a first generation basis... What you are missing here is that the Ridgeline is NOT A TRUCK, it is a mid-size suv ""Pilot"" with a different body straped on it and I will tell you the same thing about the Chevy Avalanche as its pretty much a Suburban with a different body straped on. I don't care if the Ridgeline is manufactured on the moon it is still not a true pick-up truck.  I just can't figure out why supporting what is owned, maufactured, designed and sold here ""North America"" is frowned upon.  Oh and bye the way, if you like the trucks they are driveing in Afganistan so much feel free to join the Canadian armed forces as I am sure they can arange an upclose look at one for you."
162502,doubleheader,2008-02-20 20:42:00,497,"I've owned a number of trucks, I'm now a very satisfied owner of a Honda Ridgeline. Plenty of power to pull my boat, the bed, while small, is large enough to carry a Honda Rancher atv with gate down, plenty of creature comforts, reasonable gas mileage (20 mpg on trips), very low cost maintenance, and great resale. Between my wife and I we have owned 5 Hondas. We have never paid a penny for a replacement part other than tires and brakes. They just don't break.  The hidden trunk in the bed is surprisingly big. I love mine."
162531,KyleM,2008-02-20 22:28:00,218,"If you have that money to spend, why even look at Domestics?  Fullsizes are almost all hard on gas, ride like crap, have major issues with drivelines.  Look at the new Duramax GM, the past couple weeks with that cold weather has put 90% of them here at the dealerships for new trannies.  IMHO, if I had the money Id be looking at nothing but Toyota tacomas or Nissan trucks (minus the Titan, it still has some issues)  The only exception would be 95-99 GM fullsized 5.7 trucks\suv (96 for Suburbans)....I see them everyday with 400 000 plus km."
162537,Bernie,2008-02-20 22:57:00,3190,"There are many different types of vehicles on the market today. The reason for this is everyone has different ideas and needs for their type of driving. I think the key here is to submit your experiences and respect each others input and make your own decision. Read consumer reports, talk to your mechanic (an independent from the dealer one) as well. There are good and bad points to everything made. None of them are indestructible."
162553,danbouck,2008-02-20 23:45:00,4380,"I never had a problem with my GMC's. My new one is a fully loaded 2008 Sierra Z71. It is decent on gas, rides like you've got airbag suspension and at idle you can't even tell it's running. You can get one 2-3 years old for under 30k. I've also got a 95 suburban that never has any issues.  But almost everyone is partial to a make so I say go to each dealership and test drive them all and decide for yourself which is best for you."
162611,Cookslav,2008-02-21 02:20:00,1457,"This is the funniest thing about Automoble debates...its always personal opinion I know people who swear by Volkwagon and Toyota, and Ford, and Chev, and everyone of those brands has lemons, and some real plowhorses as well.  Point and case... My cousins (2 sisters) bought brand new Sunfires back in 2000 same time, same dealer, cause they got sweet deals on an overstock sale with zero % finances... Both work close to home, neither travel....the younger sisters car is still mint, in great condition with no issues, while the older sister just scrapped hers...head gasket and a million other issues. My bro drives a ford F-10 and loves it...he's out i calgary, drove it cross canada...its getting serious use My buddy had an older Toyota...hated it caused him headaches, and parts costed him a fortune.  Everyones got a story to tell right? Do your self a favor, test drive a few in your budget range be discriminating, and cross your fingers cause unless your a mechanic  and have the time to rip her apart and inspect the whole thing there always and aspect of luck.

I have now owned an F-150 for just over a year and not a problem. I am really happy with this truck and you can get some nice 2006's for $25,000 to $27,000.  And if your looking for something different check out blackstock ford as they have dealer authorized off road and street packages for great prices. I got the mojave kit and it looks amazing.  Ryan"

162761,Tybo,2008-02-21 17:14:00,1373,"The true test of a truck.Is the fleet truck. A company truck  in which every Tom Dick and Sally drives. In my trade we get every thing delivered by truck, by many different dealers. They deliver from light bulbs to 14L diesel engines. Not one of them use a import.   If engine size is irrelevant? why does the company with the larges stock engine have the best fuel milage?"
162859,aplumma,2008-02-21 20:58:00,6896,"One of the reasons that the company's are not using imports is that the big three have big discounts for fleet purchases. When I purchased my Freightliner van for 30,000.oo I had the option to purchase a Ford stretch van for 11,000.00 less with the gas engine. I chose the Freightliner because I wanted to upgrade from the the big three with a diesel and Mercedes technology  . If I had 4 or more trucks they would all be the same for ease of repair and parts on hand so I would have gone with the big three for the discount but the market is changing since Dodge is now discounting for fleet Sprinters. Soon Nissan or Toyota will follow then you will see them all over the fleet market.   Art"

It's not like you are ever going to have 5 sheets of plywood and 15 bundles of shingles, table saw.tool box and mitre saw on top of it.  I don't have a problem with the imports. It's just that when a company comes out with one truck and are saying it's the best truck on the market.  the big three all have five different trucks for every purpose you need from a light truck.

162202,Mike the Pike,2008-02-20 00:59:00,3421,Ah the pick up can't wait until I will purchase one .For now I will ride out the next few years in a minivan.  Although I have had success with Honda Products I can't say I would jump at a Honda Ridgeline and I know the motor is very reliable because I have the same motor in my Honda Odyssey.  All that money for a 4 1/2 foot box now Toyota has an awesome look and the right size box with its Tacoma. I will probably buy used and I find I can purchase alot more truck for a great price from Ford and I need the roomier cab for my 3 kids .My Minivan actually can carry more than the ridgeline especially when the back seat is folded down in the floor.  A 2 or 3 year old loaded F-150 sells for about the same price as a used Tacoma or Ridgeline.I would consider a Honda if only they had a real pickup box.Now you Ford bashers check out this link on the page the Ford Ranger Pick up made the top ten list for most reliable vehicles on MSN.So in the 30 000 price range the Ranger would be a good purchase.IF one purchases the F-150 with the small V8 4.6 litre they will find a V8 that uses as much as a V6 the 5.4 litre is a thirsty motor.  My turn in a few years as long as gas doesn't hit $2 per litre.  Visit My Website This is the link to MSN top 10 reliable cars Not my website.

162295,sirfish,2008-02-20 06:16:00,175,"Last time I checked the chev Silverado was voted truck of the year by motoring news,motor trend,J.D powers and a few others.  GM invited ALL the competitors to thier testing grounds along with the media and at days end the Silverado outperformed ALL of them.   Not coincidence. What is amazing is that only in the last year are we hearing of massive recalls by Toyota and the likes. Thier quality is waning in light or cheaper vehicles so as to grab a larger portion of the market share. This is a trend that will continue whereas the ""big three"" have had thier wakeup call and are going the other way with quality vehicles. For years they have lagged behind in the PPM defects but are quickly closing the gap on the offshore imports. IMO,I'd buy north american for this simple reason, If just one plant is shut which employs ,say 3000 people the ripple effect will put 5 times that amount out of work and one of them could be YOU."

162321,Big Cliff,2008-02-20 11:47:00,6899,I had a Nissan Frontier 4 door for years and loved it. Excellent pulling power on the low end good gas milage (for a truck) and it was very reliable. Only reason I traded to an SUV was because I didn't need a truck anymore. If I was going to buy a truck again I would be looking at that first.
162330,taper,2008-02-20 12:28:00,611,"Roy we have a couple of those running around London and they are amazing. Domestic car manufacturers quality was lost for quite a few years in the 90's it has really rebounded.If you talk to execs they will tell you after you get your quality up to your competitions standards or better it will still take 3-5 years to change public perception. IMHO we all need to try a little harder to buy North American aas much as possible, from our vehicles all the way to the Grocery store."

The removable covered back is nice for transporting things when you want to keep stuff dry. Good saftey rating from what I've seen as well.
