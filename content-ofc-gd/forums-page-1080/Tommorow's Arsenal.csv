163296,trapshooter,2008-02-23 00:07:00,1234,"Looks like you're a big fan of the dropper.  Never fished em for perch.  Here's my all time favourite Simcoe perch bait.    The 'ratso' by Custom Jigs and Spins, except witha  glow jig head.  They are really tiny and work great, don't even need to tip em.  Good luck out there."
