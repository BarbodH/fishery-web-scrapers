Just got a phone call from a friend that's on the water. Said below the dams had 3.5-to-4 feet of vis. I looked today and the river was MINT, blue/green.  A couple of reports from other anglers on the lower yesterday. Some BIG numbers being hooked/landed in the past 24 hours!!! This is what we've all been waiting for!    (will ""try"" to post some pics of current conditions later tonight)  See you on the river,  Paul Castellano Cast Adventures"
