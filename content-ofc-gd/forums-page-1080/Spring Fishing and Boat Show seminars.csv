159627,bassdreamer,2008-02-11 21:41:00,128,thanks for the imfo tanglelines.
159638,kennyman,2008-02-11 22:05:00,737,"Thankyou very much for going out of your way to post these Adrianne. I'll probably go Sunday, but since Monday is that special ""Family Holiday"" now, maybe it'll be then. I'll see when my buddy wants to go. So, just to clarify exactly what seminars do you have to pay for and which (if any) are free.? Sorry, but not much is very clear."
159647,fishdawg,2008-02-11 22:39:00,912,"last year in May,  Vito & Dave Sullivan put on a smaller seminar at JB's on a Saturday night - it was done as a fundraiser for the Ringwood Hatchery.  They had such a good response & turnout that they wanted to to do it again this winter. Only at a more centralized location.  I think its a great idea  Cant wait, as lishtening to these guys is the equivellant of the musky-odysey speakers."

159701,Roy,2008-02-12 01:52:00,13728,Good stuff thank you for that and to everyone else who's contributed info on the show.
159720,maybe,2008-02-12 02:18:00,307,"Thanks for pasting in the list of exhibitors, Craig.  I've received a pdf copy of the exhibitors list and floor plan.  It's too big for the attachment file size limit.  I've crunched it down to a jpg that's good enough to give a rough idea on the fly.    If anyone wants the full-sized pdf (2.5mb), shoot me your email address in a PM, and I'll send it over.  To the best of my knowledge, the only class not included in the standard $12 ticket is the salmon masters seminar (8am to 11am Saturday, Aviation Hall A or Conference Room 1, depending what pdf you read - 2 names for 1 room).  I have a habit of charting schedules out in a spreadsheet.  Makes it easy to choose the seminars I'm interested in, and see how they fit together - which ones overlap, which ones don't have enough time to travel between, yadda yadda.  It turned up one situation I think might be an error.  The 12:30pm to 1pm Saturday slot is doublebooked on the CSFL Pro Panel and Tips schedule.  It shows Paul Powis cleaning fish during the first half of the Walleye Panel presentation.  I assume that everything on the CSFL Pro Panel and Tips pdf takes place on the CSFL stage in the bottom left corner of the floor plan.  This is the only time I found seminars in the same venue overlapping like this.  The walleye presentation is also mistakenly written as beginning at 12:30 AM.  Looks like we'll be going on Saturday.  I'll be checking into the walleye/cleaning conflict - I've already seen Paul's cleaning demo, but the walleye presentation is interesting."
159721,Craig Butler,2008-02-12 02:20:00,5,I'll be at the Mizmo booth for the duration so stop in and say hi.
159753,kennyman,2008-02-12 04:55:00,737,"Thanks again Tangled Lines. I was hoping the other seminars were free. That's the best part of the show for me. I love learning about this hobby and I know that so far I'm just scratching the surface. While I'm at the show I'll probably only drop another $50-$100 if the deals are decent, but if everyone that attends does that the show will work out well for everyone involved. The seminars are the draw,but the booths reap the benefits."
161684,kennyman,2008-02-18 21:22:00,737,"I ended up seeing the Ron James + Leo Stakos, Dave Mercer, Italo Libignan and JP Derose seminars (JP's was more of a product overview of Megabass (Megabucks) lures). I talked with Ron+Leo and Italo afterwards for a few minutes and met Charlie Wray. All were very nice, sociable guys. The seminars were about what you'd expect. I don't mean that in a bad way, just that Ron and Leo were being .... well, funny and informative, trying to include everyone and encouraging other ethnic groups to join in and fish responsibly. Dave Mercer was his usual likeable,high strung self and you always get the feeling that he's about as honest a person as there is on this planet. He's not up there acting, what you see is what you get. He is honestly trying to teach you and he cares about the hobby,loves his job,is very grateful and feels very fotunate to be where he is. You like this guy more everytime you see him. Italo was just winging it with his quiet confidence (some may mistake it for arrogance). He is VERY comfortable up there and you get the feeling that he could just as easily wing it for four hours and keep you entertained and learning the whole time. He exceeded my expectations and I'm not sure why but I went in there with a slight preconceived distaste for him and came out really liking him,even more after meeting him. I kind of felt guilty for prejudging him. I'd love to go fishig with this guy,actually any of them. As far as the rest of the show,it wasn't as big as last years,but you get the feeling that this IS going to be the premier fishing show. The owner and I believe CFSL pres. (can't remember his name) was personally involved in the seminars and you can tell,he loves what he's doing. That bodes very for the future of this show as well. I can't wait until next year already. All I bought was a few lure (six out of the 3 for $10 bin), one $2 pack of plastics and a Quantum IM6 pole for my son (I stepped on his and broke the tip last summer). It was a great day out and I didn't spend a fortune."
163078,goteeboy,2008-02-22 14:06:00,175,"personally, i think the show was pretty lame. though i was very tempted w/ the 16ft lund deal.  i saw italo's seminar on monday. imho, he talks as if he's talking to a 3 year old who's never held a fishing rod before. i guess he's good for a newbie, but i got nothing out of him.  and i was surprised at how small the area of the show was. i was expecting a lot more and a lot bigger. oh well..at least the kids got in free, but by monday, th trout in the pond were so lethargic. and the only was to catch one was by snagging which is what everyone seemed to be doing. hehe."
159596,fishinggeek,2008-02-11 19:40:00,325,"Lew, that muskie odyssey thing sounds amazing, especially since I am trying to learn about muskie fishing.  I'll make a note of attending next time it's on.  Steve, thanks for the info.  Still I wonder how much better the big sportsman show will be.  I know it's a bit more expensive especially without free parking, but I know it's bigger and better IMHO so I might still wait until that one and skip the spring fishing show."
159602,irishfield,2008-02-11 19:53:00,26272, It's a $2 discount for getting up early Roy and finding the secret entrance door for the 8am seminar!
159614,maybe,2008-02-11 20:43:00,307,"Vita called me about an hour ago.  I took a few notes...  The salmon masters seminar is a separate entity, not part of the show itself per se.  The gang from Scotty are doing it on their own, and just happen to be having it at the same center at the same time as the show.  Letting the students into the show free when they're primed to spend money with the exhibitors seems sensible.  The salmon seminar is at 8am Saturday, and tickets are limited.  Tickets are available through these show supporters: --JB's Fishing Depot  (Toronto) --Tightlines  (Pickering) --Natural Sports  (Kitchener) --Grimsby Tackle  (Grimsby) --Hook Line & Sinker  (Guelph) --Fishing World  (Hamilton)  If you want salmon tickets and can't get to one of these stores, you may also be able to reserve tickets by emailing Vita.  If there are tickets left, she'll put them aside for you, and you can pick them up at the main door of Hall 5.  I suggest including your phone # in your email, just in case.  General admission tickets to the show are not available online.  There will be a ticket booth at the main entrance to Hall 5.  The ticket booth accepts CASH ONLY.  An ATM will be available in the lobby.  Information for the official show guides just went out to the printer's this morning.  I'm the first person to get copies of the seminar schedules.  If I've managed to figure out the attachment system, they should appear below:  Seminars___CSFL_Pro_Panel_and_Tips___Fishing_and_Boat_Show_2008.pdf Seminars___Master_Angler___Fishing_and_Boat_Show_2008.pdf Seminars___Megatank___Product_Reviews___Fishing_and_Boat_Show_2008.pdf  I've asked for copies of the exhibitor's list, and the show floor plan.  They should arrive sometime later today.  For anyone unfamilliar with the International Centre, here's the main Centre floor plan and a pdf of just Hall 5.  That's about all I know at the moment."
159617,tdotfisherman,2008-02-11 20:49:00,317,T.L. thanks for posting those PDF files.. Now I can plan things a little bit more clearly..
