420384,chrispyke,2010-01-09 16:42:00,51,"Just got back off Balsam...turns out my hut is in 8' - 9' of water over a mud flat...can clearly see the bottom.  Beleive according my gps close to deep water on one side 15 -18 '  and weeds of 5'-6' on the other.  Caught about a dozen perch missed that many as well on live shiners.  Was hoping to see the odd pike but no such luck...the 6 lb line would not have handled them.  A few of the perch hit the split shot, so maybe small jigs may be in order.  It was a great start and fealt a little like a historic occasion.  Pattern may be like the bog and better action in the evening/dark...going to give that a go tommorw.  Best of Luck !  BL"
432574,ciscokid,2010-02-12 04:45:00,52,  is that only for balsam or other kawartha lakes with the pike problem as well?
432669,GBW,2010-02-12 16:02:00,8460,I would guess all but best bet is to contact Tom
432675,fish-miester,2010-02-12 16:28:00,864,   Balsam has most of the pike problem as they have settled in there as well as canal lake. the other lakes are pike free for the most part from what i understand
432702,Tom McCutcheon,2010-02-12 18:29:00,627,  fish-miester you are correct... At this time we believe that the Pike are only in as far as Balsam and Canal on the west end of the system. There have been reports of Pike caught at Percys Reach on the east end. Our initiatives are to try and determine how well established the Northern Pike are in these areas. Our studies will hopefully lead us to a happy solution to this problem.  Tom McCutcheon Release Director Kawartha Lakes Chapter Muskies Canada
432749,fishermccann,2010-02-12 21:24:00,655,"I have fished Cameron Lake for 30 years, (thats where the cottage is) , and have not caught a pike in the lake yet. Soon I suspect, as we are next in the chain!"
416510,fish-miester,2009-12-29 21:30:00,864,"Hey guys was wondering if any one has checked out balsam or new how the ice was doing up there.. I have been outa town for the last little bit  or else I would of checked for my self.  as well as could any one point me in a direction of where I should ""try my luck"" Im going with a friend of mine for some perch, crappie and maybe some pike. any help would be appreciated  thanks again  a fellow angler"
416525,musky66,2009-12-29 22:36:00,273,Please catch and keep PIke by all means- be aware that incidental Musky must be released quickly and safely. I would try the lower ends of West and South bays- look for around 8 to 12' of water would put you in scattered weeds or just outside the deep weed edge.
416526,Terry,2009-12-29 22:38:00,14456,"yeah, I would like to get there myself and give it a try, but who know what kind of ice conditions the lake has guess we will find out"
416544,GBW,2009-12-29 23:11:00,8460,"the lake we are on is just a bit N.E. of balsam and we have a good solid 6"" of ice as of yesterday.  It's not the size of balsam so a local would know better but I'm going to guess with this cold snap 4"".  DO NOT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, it's a guess with out going and testing..."
416547,fish-miester,2009-12-29 23:16:00,864,"thanks for the info musky. we were planning on catching and keeping pike, as well as the odd crappie. and were hoping to head out on the first (ice permitting) as for pike.. whats the limit? or is there one on the kawarthas as there an invasive species? thanks again"
416563,Kerry,2009-12-30 00:09:00,383,"musky66, any idea if there is a current area around the balsam dr launch in the winter.I've never used any other access point to the lake other than the prov. park and I doubt they would open that area to the public in the winter to access the lake.  fish-meister,there is a limit to the pike just as any other lake.I'm sure it's stated in the online changes for Zone 17.There are limits(crappies) and limits and size limits(bluegills)for zone 17 as well.All of it is on the MNR website.Hopefully they have the printed versions in store by the weekend. Kerry"
416566,Beans,2009-12-30 00:19:00,3339,Northern pike in zone 17 = S-6 C-2 no limit on size
416568,irishfield,2009-12-30 00:22:00,26272,Remember those reg books are free.. and here's the on-line for 2010 for Zone 17. http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR_E001336.pdf  Pike season is now open all year except where noted by exception. Limit is still 6 for Sport.. 2 for Con.
416570,fish-miester,2009-12-30 00:22:00,864,"thanks guys! ya I have picked up the new updated regulations as well as the 2010 regulation book , though I normally dont fish for pike and if I do I dont keep them. but lets say I do catch a few pike what are some good recipes? or what are your favorites?"
416576,irishfield,2009-12-30 00:29:00,26272,"Just fillet them like a pickeral... then slice out the Y bones.. batter with your favourite stuff and deep fry. If you get all the bones out.. nobody will know, that's eating them, that they aren't 'eyes!"
416577,Michael_Brown,2009-12-30 00:29:00,411,"Pike are very good eating, you just need to be a little more careful when cleaning them as they have ""Y"" bones that run down both sides. Filllet them, find the line of Y bones and remove and them cook them in any way you would cook a walleye. Have fun."
416586,fish-miester,2009-12-30 00:40:00,864,"awesome thanks guys , I have filleting walleye under my belt and have been youtube'ing best ways to fillet pike. and I'm sure it wont be to hard either."
416765,Beans,2009-12-30 14:18:00,3339,Yep...You fillet pike the same way you would fillet a mucksie !...
416766,GBW,2009-12-30 14:24:00,8460,"if you do catch pike and not interested in it, walk over to the closest person on the ice and offer it to them so it's not going to go to waste."
416864,Tom McCutcheon,2009-12-30 20:00:00,627,"Please, Please, Please be sure it is a pike you are keeping and not a muskie.  If someone does catch and keep a pike that they are NOT interested in eating, if you can freeze it whole and get it to me I will give it to the OMNR Biologists for a stomach content research and also DNA testing. This will coincide with the research that Muskies Canada and the OMNR will be conducting on Balsam Lake over the next few years.  You can E-mail me with the details and I will make arrangements to collect the specimen.  Thanks  Tom McCutcheon Release Director Kawartha Lakes Chapter Muskies Canada."
417070,fish-miester,2009-12-31 03:55:00,864,"hey tom , I know which is which but if it comes down to it, and some one I am fishing with or my self are not going to keep it to eat it I will defenetly let you know !"
417125,Tom McCutcheon,2009-12-31 14:24:00,627,Thank you sir and any others also....  Tom.
417305,chrispyke,2009-12-31 22:58:00,51," Was on the ice today skating with the family and punched a couple of holes.  the first hole was 20 yards of shore at the bottom of South Bay.  I measured 5"".  The second spot was about 100 yards off shore in 4 fow measured 4"" - 5"".  I wouldn't say it was all black ice either.  Definately safe to walk on.  Later in the day a couple of sleds came by about 400 yards of shore...they kept pretty close to shore and didn't venture into the main lake too far.  I do know...I think I'm going to wait another week or so.  Plus the fact that there is a big pressure crack just in front of my shoreline with water on either side making it difficult to get the hut out.  I saw no other sled tracks anywhere....I would be very careful!!  BL"
417372,musky66,2010-01-01 01:08:00,273,Kerry- wouldn't surprise me if the ice was questionable off of the launch near the canal- no doubt some water movement there.
418391,Kerry,2010-01-04 01:24:00,383,"Thanks musky66.it's early anyway, I won't be venturing out there till I see some posts on some good spots to access with parking.Lots of perch and pike action on cooch right now and lots of good ice too where we go so the need to fish is being taken care of! Cheers to a great ice fishing season where ever we fish. Kerry"
419684,chrispyke,2010-01-07 21:54:00,51," Just got back from Balsam....put my hut out today.  A solid 7"" of black ice + 2"" of white ice on top....no problem for my sled.  Lots of sled tracks around...will be fishing it hard this weekend.  I'm in South Bay and the only hut out there at the moment.  Good luck !  BL"
419690,Michael_Brown,2010-01-07 22:10:00,411,I was planning on checking out south bay this weekend. How deep is the area around your hut? I think I will start out deep and work my way into the scattered weed beds trying to find the pike. Crappie and perch will be a bonus.  Good luck.
419697,Terry,2010-01-07 22:26:00,14456,I will look for you hut when I make it out there
419720,chrispyke,2010-01-07 23:30:00,51," I didn't have my graph..but went by 2 hand held gps.  This spot throughout the year has produced plenty of pan fish, musky, odd walleye.  Hoping to get into Pike.  I expect the depth is around 13-16 fow.  Don't know yet for sure...but it sits on the edge of a weedline that goes up to 6 fow.  Hoping for the best...I can always move the hut.  If your out in South Bay it is near the bottom...can't miss it...I'm the only one there right now.  Going to pike up some small minnows from Talbot...he gives you a ton of bait for $10.  Should be out there on the weekend for sure.  Stop by if you're in the area.  BL  Good Luck !"
419756,Michael_Brown,2010-01-08 00:19:00,411,"One hut in a bay in a new body of water everyone wants to learn. You should just name your hut ""magnet"".  Good luck, I will stop by if I'm in the area."
