Nice cabin Ice fishing (of course) Skidoo rental for the duration of the four days.

Thanks in advance folks.  G."
420404,Rizzo,2010-01-09 17:51:00,4754,"sorry G can't help you with the ""north"" part. Best vacation I had as a single guy was taking a 4 day cruise alone. Met all kinds of people"
420433,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-09 19:42:00,10439,Baffin Island is nice this time of year.
420650,Spiel,2010-01-10 13:38:00,9065,This might work for you Gerritt. It's something I've always wanted to do though it won't be this year.  http://www.northland-paradise.com/index.html  Note: they don't have sled rentals.
420723,irishfield,2010-01-10 17:07:00,26272,Yep.. the Adams are great folks... and their daughter Sue outfishes her husband Des in most Bass Tourneys they enter....

420860,crappieperchhunter,2010-01-10 22:45:00,2582,Can't help you with any of the leg work Gerritt. But I used to work with a fellow who took a weeks vacation every winter and ran the snowmobile trails up Cochrane way. He said the trails up there are fantastic and that Cochrane is a snowmobilers paradise so I would assume rentals might be a good possibility up there. He did bed and breakfast places alone the way and really had a great time. He wasn't a fisherman at all..but I know the area has it's share of fishing destinations.  He was so enthusiastic about his vacation every winter...almost made me wanna check into it myself sometime.  Just a suggestion G...wish I could be more helpful.
420922,aplumma,2010-01-11 01:07:00,6896,"  I dont mind winter once a year as long as their is a spring,summer and fall between them.   Art"
432880,Spiel,2010-02-13 13:28:00,9065,"So Gerritt, did you ever get away or is it still in the making?"
432992,Gerritt,2010-02-13 22:36:00,6129,"Spiel... no not yet... but then new work came up and kind of put a kink in things... massive job @ Henderson Hospital that I am in charge of.... Huge five floor asbestos abatement and rebuild.  But...  I am heading to Bernie's.. next friday in fact, and there just happens to be an open seat for you... should you be so inclined!  G."
432998,JohnF,2010-02-13 22:47:00,3494, Ummm. That could be after our bass opener.  jf
433004,CLofchik,2010-02-13 23:01:00,854," Lol, thinking the same thing!  Right here what you need to do... Cheap flight from Buffalo to Costa Rica Rent an enduro bike or ATV Ride around the rain forests camping or finding local lodgings Whenever you hit the coast rent a local panga to go out chasing yellowtail tuna, roosterfish and jacks. Come home tanned, full of fresh caught tuna and stuffed with cheap local Central American food.  1 week of riding    Toto...we're not in Kansas anymore!    Forget dropping bundles of cash on a 40' sportfisherman charter, hire a local panga to go out chasing inshore fish.    Deluxe housekeeping suite...$35/night     Single guy, working man's Costa Rica vacation, all for under USD$1k. It's like taking a snowmobiling ice fishing vacation...only without the snow & ice...and the nightlife is livlier...and the bikini factor is much higher in Costa Rica this time of year than Chapleau"
