429475,fish_fishburn,2010-02-04 16:34:00,1311,I'm mostly Shimano myself. I would say the Curado is the best bang for your buck. There the workhorse of my reels. The Chronarchs are sweet as well but a bit more expensive.
429509,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-04 19:07:00,3761," I agree, great reels. I own the r-type and i put it on a Rapala TS2 7'0 MH"

431589,waynec,2010-02-09 21:41:00,3,"If you have the money to buy an Ardent XS1000 baitcasting reel priced at about USD$289.99 then consider buying an Abu Garcia Revo Skeet Reese 6.4:1 baitcasting reel http://www.abugarcia.com/prod.php?k=132609...2584&u=REVO SKEET REESE. If you want the rod and reel colour scheme to match/compliment each other, the Revo SK reel, black with yellow trim, will match the black and mostly yellow coloured Wright & McGill SR Tessera rod better than the dark green coloured Shimano Curado reel. I have the Revo SR reel and like it. The Revo SR is an upgraded version of the 2008/2009 Revo Premier reel. Skeet Reese changed the Revo Premier reel from magnetic linear braking to centrifugal braking, which Shimano baitcasting reels use. The centrifugal brakes are easier to change on a Shimano than an Abu Garcia reel. I can live with it since I set the brake pins once and screw on the sideplate and rarely make any further setting changes. Reese added more ball bearings for more smoother retrieve and replaced the retrieve paddle with a bigger one for more torque power. Of course, Reese added his trademark black and yellow colours to the reel. The 2010 higher end Revo reels have the Infini Brake System which uses sealed centrifugal brakes and linear magnetic brakes. I bought my Revo SK on sale for about $280 from www.gagnonsports.com in Oshawa, ON. I think www.paddletales.com in Windchester, ON has them also."
431614,ryansusanna,2010-02-09 22:47:00,27,"Obviously the wrong section, but i have 3 right handed Curado's for sale, used 1 season. 101D (small one), 300D (muskie model), and an E7.  U2U me if interested."
431876,mepps,2010-02-10 18:03:00,1301,"Ive got a Shimano Calcutta and a Quantum Cabo CBC30PTs and I love em both. Both have seen heavy use in fresh and salt water and are a bit worse for the wear, but I still have faith in them both!  Cabelas has the Cabo on sale for 100 (usually 185) - CBC30PTs 	270/14 	5.7:1 - Sadly the only have right hand retrieves left..."
432154,singingdog,2010-02-11 11:25:00,1047,"Just for a different perspective, I will suggest the BPS Rick Clunn reel. I have one that has been thoroughly abused for the past 3 seasons and it still works like a charm. If you watch for the sales, you can often pick them up for less than $100. The brakes are super easy to adjust and it is built very well."
432214,Jackie,2010-02-11 15:12:00,124,"I generally like Shimanos better than Daiwas.  I own the Curado and the Cardiff; both are fine reels for their prices.  I have owned Daiwa Viento and Rojo and just don't find them as quiet and smooth as the similarly-priced Shimanos.  Also fish a lot with my Revo SX and Premier.  Both are fine but I find the magnetic brake control pretty useless (in the sense that I always have to dial close to ""max"" to avoid any bird's nest).  Of all the above reels, I actually like my Pflueger Supreme the best: very smooth, quiet, and the UBS works very well.  The only complaints are the thumb bar sits a bit higher than usual, and the paint can wear off quickly.  Mine turned from green to brownish gold for some strange reason!  Mechanically it's still like new after 3 or 4 years of heavy use.  Highly recommended."
432215,bigbuck,2010-02-11 15:14:00,2449,"BTW, what type of fishing do you plan on using the reel for?? Us musky guys have piped up with our choices but musky reels and bass reels are different animals. Mind you, the Curado 300 is about the size of many bass reels out there and it will give you more choice as to the type of fishing you plan on doing."
432275,Garry2Rs,2010-02-11 17:27:00,1425,"For musky baits, reel size matters but so does gear ratio. I once made the mistake of taking a Shimano Chronarch to the Moon River for Musky. I had two St.Croix's with Calcutta's but thought it might make a good Bucktail reel on a heavy bass rod. The 6.3 to 1 gears wore my wrist out! These double bladed Cowgirls etc. also block a lot of water even 4 to 1 might be good with them.  Abu C3, C4 or C5 are all good reels at a low price.  They need to be oiled often as the worm gear and pawl on the level wind tend to wear out fast if you don't do the routine maintenance. 7000's are okay, but they are never sold in saltwater stores.  That tells me that despite their size, they aren't really built for heavy duty.  For cost efficiency, since you already have the Revo, I would again suggest sending it to Professional Reel Service.  Get the spool bearings upgraded $28.00US and have it super-tuned $14.00US.  The reel will then be much better than any Revo or Corado etc. and the cost will be under $50.00CDN."
429321,johnston1010,2010-02-04 02:58:00,12,I'm looking to buy a new bait casting reel to pair with my 7'2 Skeet Reese wright & Mcgill toad and senko rod and I have a   Abu Garcia® Revo™ S Low-Profile Baitcast Reel and I find I don't like it that much. So i'm thinking of buying a Ardent XS1000 Baitcast Reel but thats alot of money for a reel so is there a good baitcasting reel for a good price that will cast well.

429336,Garry2Rs,2010-02-04 03:16:00,1425,You might want to send your Revo to Professional Reel Service in Wichita Kansas. www.proreelservice.com For about $20.00 they will clear lube and Pro-tune your old reel so that it casts like a $300.00 model.  For an extra 25.00 they will also install the best bearings that money can buy.
429338,Aaron Shirley,2010-02-04 03:17:00,655,"If you want a great low profile baitcasting reel for a ridiculously low price, look at the Rapala RType reel (10 bearing), about $100.  I have been using them for over a year now pretty hard, and they are a really smooth, nice-looking reel that casts well.  They are holding up well with no issues.  You can buy two of these for a similar quality reel by another brand.  Even the Volt is a nice reel for $60.  Rapala Reels  Aaron"

429375,BillM,2010-02-04 04:18:00,17367," You want a full sized reel for throwing muskie baits (Abu Record, Calcutta, etc etc)"
429380,muskymike,2010-02-04 04:28:00,772," You dont necessarily need a full sized reel. I have a Curado which I use on my bucktail rod, if I were to purchase again, yes, I would probably buy a full sized, and not a low pro.  I find the drag system better (smoother on a round). But my Curado has caught me plenty of fish including my largest. I have it spooled up with 80lb PP.  Plus, if you listen to Bill, you are going to end up a chrome fisherman, and not a musky guy."
429391,Stoty,2010-02-04 05:35:00,2910,"Anything Shimano or Diawa. Stay away from Quantum...garbage!  I'd also advise to wait until the BPS Spring Fishing Classic and their ""reel trade-in"" deals!"
429400,Blake,2010-02-04 12:11:00,418,The Shimano Curado or Citica would be a great reel for ya.  I have Curado's and put them through alot of hard fishing and use them for many applications.
429421,Court R,2010-02-04 13:23:00,213,WOW! I would go with the Quantum Energy PT
429422,smally21,2010-02-04 13:26:00,993,"im a shimano guy and i like the curado.  i did pick up some quantum accurist low profile reels last year and i like them just fine for half the price.  they are losing their finish rather quickly, but at 100$ i would buy again. it is hard to pick baitcasters in the store, you really need to use them as opposed to handle them to get a good feel.  good luck"
429433,ottawaguy,2010-02-04 14:09:00,11,I bought a curado 300e last year and a st. croix LTM80MHF / TOP-N-TAIL.  With that combination I can cast all day long.  The curado can handle big fish.

429440,bigbuck,2010-02-04 14:40:00,2449,"The Curoado 300E is a great reel for musky fishing. Either Quantum PT, Shimano Curado or mid range Daiwa's will suit you fine. It come's down to your personal preference and most importantly your pocketbook. Piece of advice, save up to buy decent equipment, cheap reels are just that, you'll end up replacing them and spending more money than you have to."
429445,solopaddler,2010-02-04 14:54:00,8605, Actually the Revo Toro and Curado 300 are more than fine for many applications.
429446,Raf,2010-02-04 14:59:00,3495," yes, most but not all.  i'll add the quantum cabo - cbc30pts too.. another low profile that can handle the job  but bill is right, for specialized applications like those big double bladed baits none of those will work for too long.  you will need something like an abu 7000."
429448,trapshooter,2010-02-04 15:00:00,1234," I use the largest sized Curado (300 series) for throwing smaller bucktails and topwater on one of my muskie rigs.  Works great, love it."
429449,s2k4mee,2010-02-04 15:05:00,73,I just recently picked up a Shimano Core 51 MG.  Can't wait for soft water to come!!!
429450,Abraxus,2010-02-04 15:16:00,104,"' This is not really that accurate.  I have been using the Abu Garcia C3 and C4 reels and an Okuma ID400LX for Musky fishing for years.  These reels are the larger round barrel baitcasters.  They have worked great, but just this past year, I picked up the Abu Garcia REVO Turo Reel for Musky.  It is a low profile baitcaster that is built like tank and can pull a truck from the ditch.  Very nice reel!  It is very smooth when casting and fits oh so nice in the palm of your hand.  Even better, it isnt rediculously priced like some of the comparible shimanos.  I really like this reel.  It has all the bells and whistles as well.  It comes with the clicker for your drag when trolling and it also comes in two models.  One has a smaller spool which holds less line and is much better for casting applications and then there is another model which has a much larger spool for crazy line capacity.  I got the one with the smaller spool, but when running 80lb braid on there, there isnt as much line capacity as I would like and if I had it do over again, I would have went with the larger spool model.   Other then that, the reel has performed flawlessly for me.  Ab"
