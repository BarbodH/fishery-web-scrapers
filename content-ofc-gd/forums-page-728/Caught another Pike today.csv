By the way, I've got some new n improved pike leaders here for ya.  You ever in the GTA??  How'd you like to tango with a 40 incher!!  cheers HD"
432750,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-12 21:33:00,3761," Yes, I'll need those again from you this year. Going to be doing lot's of spring time Pike fishing before I head to my summer job in the end of May. We will need to hook up and show me how to catch some Northern's in open water. Toronto bound? I live in Oshawa."

432814,ADB,2010-02-13 01:45:00,444,Is it just me wondering why this topic hasn't been locked?  Enough is enough already.
432815,brifishrgy,2010-02-13 01:45:00,559,"  He might have got the info from a friend or ""other"" way but he found it .. obviously you have never lost a fishing spot due to the net .. used to fish Dunnville for cats with maybe 2-3 other people on the river .. someone post how good it is and how good the walleye fishing is and now your lucky not to bump into a couple dozen boats within 50 yards of each other every weekend let alone hook into a fish .. its pretty pathetic that someone blurs a background and these armchair fisherman who dont want to do their own legwork whine and cry because they cant figure out where to fish  go buy a map .. mark out where the blue is .. thats water .. drive there or ride you bike .. cast out a line and see if anything is there .. if not carry on to the next blue patch"
432816,brifishrgy,2010-02-13 01:47:00,559,  all the Mods are at the fishing show getting ready for the meet and greet

I remember who shows respect on this forum and when asked politely (an not out of the blue) I will always share info to that person, if they are nice to me I do the same and I am sure it is that way with any other member here. To show respect is to gain respect.  I appreciate the responses and hope I take the blow for the river guys an other people that ""blur"" spots this winter/spring. I really don't mind the abuse as the saying goes ""stick's and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me"" Hope you see the next 2 reports from me in the next 5 days, more Pike fishin!  Can't wait to see guys catching walleye and giant perch this weekend in the reports early next week!  Good fishin, Mike"

432826,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-13 02:12:00,4399,  ya come on mods lock this thing up already the youngster are getting fed up with all us old people.  Don`t mind me boys I haven`t had a smoke in over a week and I am a little edgy. You`ll have to excuse me now it`s time for the nurse to change my diaper!!
432828,ctdd2006,2010-02-13 02:23:00,531,  PM me if you don't like it???  Funniest post in a while!  Peace out Coolio!

432041,Grimace,2010-02-11 00:55:00,2020,"I am kinda on the fence with this one as I do not believe people should be openly sharing there fishing spots on an open forum like this.  At the same time I do not think saying what lake your on is a big deal, unless it is a small little gem people do not know about then the infamous lake x would appear.  However I have to admit I snickered to myself when I saw these whited out photos.  A solution.  What Irishfield said. Makes it look better.  I have one too.    Get your buddy to stand and you kneel (insert joke here),  he takes picture downwards on an angle and all that is in your background is ice, makes for a good picture as well.  It also doesn't look ridiculous to share on the web.  Cheers"
432065,pikeie,2010-02-11 01:37:00,380,Think i should blur the background on this picture?? Come on lake of the woods isnt that big!  haha
432066,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-11 01:40:00,3761,"I fixed the picture. Honestly I am not a artist and it will take a few mins for Photobucket to update the photo but I cropped the hell out of it just for the people on here that like to bi t ch and complain all day long. I hope nobody else needs to take time out of their day after a long day of fishing, share how they did and upload pic's type out a quick report and have it complained about and crapped on.  Just wanted to saw thank you to the 9 or so reply's that auctually were appreciative towards my catch. Thanks for the positive response guys."
432071,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-11 01:46:00,0,don't mind the elitists mike. they must be upset they aren't getting out as much as you.

432077,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-11 01:54:00,3761, End it dude. Nobody cares.
432135,fish-miester,2010-02-11 04:32:00,864,  how old are you ? seriously..
432149,Dozer,2010-02-11 06:08:00,896,"Good for you protecting your fishery.  Last thing you need is people showing up on your ground, littering, taking your hot spots, etc.  Sounds like someone had a bad day, what to do?  I caught a bunch of pike previous season just minutes from my house in Toronto.  What sense is there telling everyone my spot so that when I go fishing, its plugged up with other people?  I am sorry, I offer a lot of help but I wont give out spots to the general public."
432150,GoneFishin,2010-02-11 06:55:00,349,"HEYYYY come on now guys!!  I showed him this spot and """"""""""  I  """""""""" asked him not to post the location on the web. He's being a good guy and not going against my wishes I didn't want every one to know about this spot because there would be 200 people there every day no doubt, even though were just fishing for snot rockets.. LOL!  Give him a break, the only reason you guys don't care is because you have the opportunity to fish different areas all the time!"
432158,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-11 11:54:00,4399," Seriously dude, too old to arguing with a bunch of whinny self entitled kids from the it`s all about me generation.  But the replys have been interesting."
432162,Spiel,2010-02-11 12:42:00,9065,"Wow, all this over a few edited photos.  Here's a tip Mike, before having your buddy snap the picture consider kneeling down on the ice (perhaps next to your auger hole) and have him take the picture from a standing position. Voila, no need to edit out the background.  Moving on....."

432517,Leecher,2010-02-12 02:39:00,7832,Ya doing great Mike the Gator Fisher Thanks for sharing Leechman
432590,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-02-12 05:32:00,158,"Poor guy, all he was trying to do was show a pic of a fish.  Dude protect your spots.  I give away spots when I know many other people already know about them.  If others already know then who cares.  Sometimes I Give away spots so steer people away from where I actually fish.  I guide on Lake of the Woods and let me tell you, the competetion for good spots between guides at the lodge is nuts... and then you have to deal with guides from competing lodges.  And then there are the real sly buggers who hire you to guide for a day and then you find them on your spot next week or next month.  We call those pork and beaners.  People up there learn to follow guide boats.  Some will even push up on a tiny hump you are trying to fish.  By tiny, I mean its smaller than the boat.  I learned to take photos facing the wrong direction or down on an angle like other guys suggested.  Just be creative.  Truck or portable ice hut make a good backdrop.  There's nothing worse than someone you know camping out on a spot only because they know they have seen you there.  My fishing partner and I lost a couple of spots that held 50""+ muskie that way lasy year.  I learned a harsh lesson there.  Those spots took me weeks and months of research and time on the water to pinpoint.  Losing a good spot for me means losing out on a big tip from a wealthy client...   The water is everyones to fish.  Your knowledge of where exactly to fish is exactly that.. YOURS.  besides just giving away spots doesn't teach people how to fish or why the fish are there anyway."
432602,darsky,2010-02-12 11:14:00,586,ya but 7 lbs ? thats the biggest joke of this thread. Does your scale start at 4 lbs ?
432606,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-12 12:26:00,3761," In all honestly at 29"" long we thought it was a joke too but when it layed on the ice it was soo fat man. Rapala Digital I'll been using for 2 years now with not 1 problem...7lb 20z on the scale, my 2 friends and I saw the weight on the scale.  Let's not forget I'm a big dude if it convinces you it was a heavy fish."
432725,FISHINGNUT,2010-02-12 19:54:00,253,"Mayby the OFC should give him his own little forum here ""ASK MTBF "" so all us uninformed dont want to do our own legwork fisherman   can lurk and wait for him to post a report  and  then rush out and fish it out ,Give me a break it has nothing to do with blured pics IMO its more the attitude that gets me  Sorry dont mean to get on you but just a few short months ago when you go from posting pics of yournew stickers for your tackle box and asking questions like"" should I buy the perch or the firetiger rapala"" to giving attitude about your vast knowledge of the sport and the lakes in Southern Ontario to guys that have been fishing longer than you have been alive."
432726,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-12 19:57:00,4399,  BINGO!!!
431915,Paully,2010-02-10 20:14:00,712, I totally disagree with you.. Next time you post a successful report please PM me and the rest of the people on this site where you were fishin and what was working.. Im sure i'll be hearing from you  If you dont like blurred backgorunds quit lookin at these reports. Simple as that.
431916,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-10 20:20:00,3761,"I agree, I found it a bit frustrating reading reports from river fisherman where they always blurred it, but finding great fishing spots down in Southern Ontario is hard to do. I, like river fishermen depend on these areas for the up most of success. If you really, really don't know of a good area to fish then I hard it hard to believe you are a good fisherman and perhaps why you are also arguing for me to share my fishing spot. Sure, when I find my 2nd good fishing spot I'll share it with the world. But at this time friends and family are the only people I share valuable or important info like this with. I'm sure you would not take a stranger off the street and share with them where you forgot your lost wallet full of money.  You would tell somebody who you know and trust will do the beneficial and more responsible thing. How do I know every fish caught will be released, or when that stranger off the street is going to bring my wallet back....Get my drift."
431921,fish-miester,2010-02-10 20:35:00,864,"so I was lookin around the site at pictures.. and came across plenty of ""blurred out photos.. many of them being them creek dwellers fishin tribs.. and well i wont go there.. cause apparently if they post a pic thats not photoshoped .. there spots will be invaded cuz some how them trout guys can find those exact trees right next to there ""perfect pool"".. but this is a little different.. say i was fishin scugog .. and i took a picture .. and in the background there was a vo's independent . and a causway in the background.. every one of us could get on google.. and type in vos independent grocers.. and v'wallah  Vo's independent .. port perry ont.. hwy 7a..right next to the causway.. hmm that was easy .. next day theres 2, then 5, then 10 more average jo's fishin there.. cuz well its that easy..  just lets put our backs down guys .. it boggles me that some people get all amped up over things like some one blurring the background of there pictures.. sure it would be nice to catch a fish just like that .. or maybe get a chance to take a swing at ""the one that got away"" .. cuz well you know you can totaly get it .. and the reporter just didnt know what he was doing or how to fish ..  - a fellow angler"
431925,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-10 20:43:00,4399, I doubt if the membership here would be all that interested in the handful of spots I fish each year. I had a trailer on Scugog for a few years and got to know the lake fairly well and on a few ocassions I recieved pm`s asking for some help with the lake and I never refused to help a fellow angler. I find blurrred backgrounds ridiculous and when someone who does it that has probably not had to pay for a fishing license yet doubly so. And stop banging your head against the wall it`s okay for people to disagree.
431930,fish-miester,2010-02-10 20:54:00,864," the past 10 years I lived in PortPerry and fished scugog ""ALOT"" last summer for example i was in a car accident and well when i wasnt in physio I was fishing just about every single day. and when some one i went to school with, or played sports with in the past.. even MTB who i met fishing off the pier down town port perry.. e-mailed me and said hey .. I would love to have an opportunity to catch some fish i didnt hessitate.. I know the lake quite well.. and I figgured I could help them out.. though I really dont find this the same situation.. when you or I would help some one out .. say take them out in the boat .. there is the hole lake to fish .. in the situation the spot we fish is easily recognizable.. like I mentioned befor in my last post.. its easy to find.. but If we were to say .. we caught the fish in kawartha lakes you guys would blow up with questions.. rice,balsome,scug,sturgeon , tri's ... etc .. so we figgured we wouldnt go there either..  how bout this.. if you guys are good.. maybe you'll get a treat... and maybe, just maybe that treat will be mtb's new playground.."
431934,BillM,2010-02-10 21:02:00,17367,I think you guys are forgetting you are talking about snot rockets    I don't think you need to worry about anyone invading your secret spots..
431936,fish-miester,2010-02-10 21:04:00,864,"haha but bill ! we caught a perch there too !!! haha   and there pretty big boogers to be called ""snot rockets"".."
431938,Fishing 24/7,2010-02-10 21:05:00,709,SOWEET hammer handle ....   twig.  snot rocket.  snake.  i love the colors !
431939,fish-miester,2010-02-10 21:06:00,864,"ya .. i prefer ""snake"".. .. or small ""Gator""... or even.. log with teeth ?"
431940,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-10 21:07:00,4399, Your last couple of post are quite entertaining!  I hate to tell you young fella but most people here are not hanging on your everyword and waiting for you and Mike to throw us a bone!!!
431941,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-10 21:07:00,3761, I'm in favor of the last option!
431942,BillM,2010-02-10 21:08:00,17367," Dude, the next time you catch a small perch put it on a live bait rig and lower it back down"
431945,fish-miester,2010-02-10 21:11:00,864," haha what can I say..  and well.. ""hate"" is a strong word.. does that mean you are going to begin stalking MTB or myself ? lol cause we have already went over the fact that no one can tell the location of this fishing hole..     how bout ""green backed Tarpon""?"
431947,fish-miester,2010-02-10 21:12:00,864,  lol does a 13'' 1lb 3oz count as a small perch ? .. or maybe im mistaken and its an invasive species such as a miniture peacock bass !!!
431948,BillM,2010-02-10 21:13:00,17367,I think a monster pike would think that's a pretty nice snack
431950,fish-miester,2010-02-10 21:16:00,864,haha I didnt let the pike decide if he wanted it for a snack.. cuz it went straight on the ice for me to snack on
431954,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-10 21:19:00,4399,"  These guys are serious Bill they weigh 13"" perch!LOL"
431955,fish-miester,2010-02-10 21:19:00,864, why not ?  i wish i measured its gut..
431957,dheitzner,2010-02-10 21:33:00,314,    My thoughts exactly. Darcy
431961,fish-miester,2010-02-10 21:40:00,864,I was joking .. since this thread has blown up into a huge joke.. who really cares if one wants to Blurr out the background of his or her photo? mike is normally great for telling people everything about his adventures and the past two outings he has decided to keep his location on the DL .. and every one starts harping ? would you have prefered if he didnt post pics at all in this situation? .. cuz if thats the case he would have a whole other bandwagon of members saying .. oh i dont believe you .. where are the pics to prove it..  im just sticking up for a friend and a fellow angler.. who has his own beliefs .. as many of you do..
431963,Governator,2010-02-10 21:50:00,879,"I think it's ridiculous that ppl even care about blurred backgrounds.  Who cares, it's all fish porn isn't it?  Even if you go to Nunavut and catch some arctic char and blur the background, I might laugh at you but I still wouldn't care.  Nice catch Mike."
431964,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-10 21:57:00,3761,"Ok, so...I got more snot rocket info...I've only seen a hand full of Pike so far this winter, and some real nice fish too. Not many people that can say in their first 6 or 7 trips out Ice fishing they have caught 4 Pike over 6lbs, a whitefish, a 11lb 5oz laketrout, 5 perch over 12"" long, a solid Black Crappie even a darn 3lb Bowfin...Like honestly boys I just once would like to keep a spot of mine secret. I can relay and have done so in many PM's over the time I've been here on good fishing spots and helping anglers out as many of you. I love to fish and when I have friends on a forum I love to broadcast and share my day of fishing with them through some photo's and a quick report.  It's fun to be able to share with a bunch of people how I did out on the water. This is a joke and the older fokes on here need to stop arguine with people that are clearly ""young kids"" in their minds. I love to Ice fish and have done well being this is my first season Ice fishing. Be warned, more reports to come..."
431968,Stoty,2010-02-10 22:01:00,2910,"1) It's a report, be thankful people share them 2) Even though blurring backgrounds is kinda funny/stupid.....not to mention it ruins the picture....who cares? 3) Why do A LOT of posts on this site turn into online flaming matches?!

432039,kingofthesteelhead,2010-02-11 00:51:00,140,I was checking out this spot last Sunday and there were 6 vehicles on the ice.I saw one 5lb pike caught and a 13 inch jumbo.I won't divulge this spot as there are some very obvious landmarks in the background that would give this away!

Fish was caught in 9ft of water on a Tip-up. I'm still waiting for a 35""+ before I get out my OFC sign. Didn't get any pic's but we also got a half dozen decent perch too. The pike weighed 7lbs 2oz  Picture of the fish, should of seen the snow today behind me    Thanks for reading and viewing, MTBF"

431685,irishfield,2010-02-10 01:47:00,26272,"Nice Pike Mike...  Now about that background... take the eye dropper.. select the cloud cover at the horizon and then select a spray bomb... and blend the ice to the skyline. Do this at full size and then downsize the picture. Most won't notice you ""adjusted"" the back ground then. Otherwise you're gonna lose readership like them steelheaders... lol"

431710,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-10 02:34:00,3761," I'll try. I've got a 23,25,29,and a 31"" pike...If I get another over 30ish then I'll get us a upgrade for the team. And if I hit another of my 12"" perch ill get that entered for us also ok.  Now, help me out and get fish'n!"
431736,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-10 03:21:00,0, I've been out but the .5-1.5 lb lakers i caught all weekend aren't gonna do the trick in the competition. lol.
431737,richyb,2010-02-10 03:22:00,774,"hey mike , what set up are you using for the pike ? how far off bottom ?  thanks"
431773,Paully,2010-02-10 11:07:00,712,nice going Mike.. Looks like you've got them pike all figured out.
431791,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-10 13:44:00,3761," The question is what have you been using? Simple circle hook with 2 split shot 4"" above the hook. Let line out until weight's hit bottom..reel up maybe 6"" and let her sit...Live minnows are key."
431803,johnnyb,2010-02-10 14:15:00,3413,"Hot dang, son!  Yer gonna have to change your name to Mike the ICE fisher for a few months outta the year!!"
431838,diggyj,2010-02-10 15:44:00,548,"If I can remember correctly your last post said you were on Simcoe. Last time I checked it is a large body of water. More people that go ice fishing on Simcoe are targeting Lakers, Whitefish and Perch and occasionally they will hook into a Pike by accident, I am also sure there are some targetting Pike like yourself.  So my question is this, why blur the background? Thought this was a board to encourage fishing and help others. What is the purpose of hiding a location? You will probably say you don't want 50 others there next time your out, which makes sense, but I just don't get it. It's kind of arrogant if you ask me.  Dirk"
431854,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-10 17:02:00,0,"there's nothing arrogant about protecting your fishing hole.  since you think it is, why don't you inform the board of all your best spots?"
431856,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-02-10 17:14:00,1107,  Not sure why you would think not posting his spot that him or his buddy took the time and effort to find for the entire membership of the largest ontario based fishing forum is arrogant that's a lot of armchair anglers seeing exactly were you are catching fish which could quite literally destoy a spot with 1 post yes it would take some time but it would have huge effects on a fishery. Nice fish MTBF just get your camera man to zoom in a bit more or take a Knee so there's only ice and snow in the back ground anyways.
431857,diggyj,2010-02-10 17:16:00,548," I do, everytime I post, I don't blurr backgrounds and I say the body of water I am on.  I am not asking for a GPS coordinate nor am I even asking for the body of water. I just dont get the resoning behind taking the time to modify a picture prior to posting a report. I think its arrogant and childish. It's almost like bragging like a child saying, HAHA, I caught a bigger fish then you. I would just like to know what you get out of hiding the background? In future take pics with your back to something less noticeable, or just say you went fishing and you caught an ""X'' inch FISH.  If I ever resort to blurring backgounds, a few things will happen. First I will stop fishing all together and I think I will move into the woods and become a recluse like Ted Kaczynski. I will live a life of solitude and play SOLITAIRE, that way no body will know where I am and what I am doing.  Dirk"
431860,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-10 17:30:00,3761,"I don't fish for Pike on Simcoe. Where I fish during the Ice season is my business. Every report I have ever done during open water fishing is and always has information on what lake and where I was fishing.  It is my choice to keep lake names, spots and general areas to myself. The location where I have been has already picked up in people fishing it and we have still been doing well. In Southern Ontario when I catch pike after pike and jumbo perch I try to keep my location disclosed. It is obviously not a secret otherwise I would not see 4 trucks out on the Ice fishing beside me.  Do research and find your own spots. There is no lake in Ontario that is a ""secret""."
431862,fish-miester,2010-02-10 17:34:00,864,"    Hey Guys, first off this is defenetly not Simcoe.(but i do give you props for your ""investigation"") Mike and I, aswell as a few other good friends have been fishing this ""area"" for most of the hardwater season and well it like many other spots has its good days and its bad days.. on top of that its more then 10 minutes down the road .. so when we plan on going there we pray that there arnt too many people out there.. or else it some times isnt worth it.. cuz well theres nothing worse then elbowing people out of your way to get to your tip up or second rod.. but hey .. fishings about adventures and having fun right ?!  As for mike bluring out the background.. thats his call.. if he doesnt want ""randoms"" off the internet slaughtering his new fishin hole.. so be it.. If this site was a little more ""locked down"" and you had to be a member to view the fourms etc then alot of these ""hidden spots"" could maybe come out of hiding.. but until then .. I as well as many others on this board would like to keep our fishing holes on the D.L so that the ""average jo"" that knows how to use google cant just invade all of our spots.. after we did all the work to find them .. fish them .. learn them.. and for them to just come in and abuse it..  just my two cents guys..    Ps. MTB cya saturday    -A fellow angler"
431863,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-10 17:37:00,3761,"Will do, glad I can bring my Dad out to a spot I have learned about and be confident to put him on some fish. Looking forward to fishing with you again buddy."
431908,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-10 20:01:00,4399,"  I am with you on this one Dirk. I find blurring backgrounds to be ridiculous and as a general rule won`t even bother to look at the pictures if they have been ruined, seems to me that when people do this it is more about looking for praise and a pat on the back. I am sure people have been catching fish out of that lake long before you were born young fella and will continue to do so. I would hazard a guess that you probably did not find this lake on your own more than likely someone told you about it and more than likely that someone who told you was told by someone else and so on. Mike I am sure your a nice young man but I find it a little curious that someone who asks a gazzilion questions on this form would bother to do that. I might invite you out Bass fishing next year if you don`t mind wearing a blindfold.LOL"
431911,Paully,2010-02-10 20:08:00,712,
431913,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-10 20:10:00,3761, Yup. I bass fish enough out of the year but thanks for the offer.
