432684,TDunn,2010-02-12 17:19:00,680,"I went back to school and I am almost done! i'll have a college business diploma by the end of 2010 hopefully! I too have been working construction for about 5-6 years and decided working for someone else is not gonna cut it forever. A friend of mine worked for sal-dan and as you said couldnt stand it. He went out the next week got a business name and voila he was his own boss. I took a job with him last year and we did garage, fence and deck installs for a few hardware stores in town plus a few private jobs. We were busy until xmas..........Now Im hitting the books again I was contacted about 2 weeks ago from a general contractor in town becasue he heard I went to school for business. It sounds like he is going to give me an opportunity to work as a supervisor on a few of his jobs if his bids are taken. Without taking a step towards education i would still be humping shingles for my uncle. For extra cash you may have noticed a few articles I have written for TJ. That has lead to being contacted by a few other mags and now i am in the process of starting my own business of writing/guiding. Moneys not amazing yet but its something i enjoy and it involves fishing!    Good luck man, hope you find what your looking for....I have to head too class now for a test then Im off to wakomata for the weekend laker hunting...   TDunn"
432699,pike slayer,2010-02-12 18:22:00,1177,"thanks for the reply TDunn. i'd like to see a report for wakomata, everytime i drive past it i say i gotta fish it and i hear great reports from ppl. i'm off to jarvis tomorrow to go slay lakers then monday heading to bone to go jig out some lakers then probably off to tupper/pickard after i got my laker limit"

Was it some of your family that tried to pull down the, live, telecomm cables up Hearst way?? ""I don't know officer.. my brother was riding along on his ATV and died""... turned out he was standing in water while pulling the wires down off the poles!!"
432721,redneck666,2010-02-12 19:36:00,563, i was tellin a story which i thought was sorta funny.... you took it WAAAAY outta context. I am not a thief nor is my imediate family. my uncle and his borther have always been that way and i no longer partake in that kind of activity! and my family is way to smart to do something as stupid as that. FYI my uncle and his borther no longer do that either. uncles brother owns his own contracting business and uncle works like a regular man. i dont much appreciate your false accusations.  i didnt much care for what you wrote and i found it to be offensive.

432723,redneck666,2010-02-12 19:52:00,563," LOOK, im NOT going to sit here and argue about such a retarded thing. we ALL used to make mistakes and still do. NO ONE is perfect. people need to realize that! im NOT a thief. my part in that operation was to clean the metal and take things apart. people need to make money and thats the way we did it. NONE of my family does that anymore like i said im not gunna sit here and argue. leave it where its at people.  i think its best that this thread is closed now."

432468,archie_james_c,2010-02-12 01:15:00,618,  As much as I like unions I will say they seem to be as corrupt or more than any thing else. So far I've watched 4 of my friends magically land Iron Worker apprenticeships because their dad's happen to be foremans in the local...  but I guess once you get in you're good to go
432471,danc,2010-02-12 01:19:00,4677,You are an inspiration to all of us Cliff. It's no surprise to me that you continue to succeed. I have a 47 year old 2nd year apprentice working under me that was laid off from a local paper mill after 27 years of service. He reminds me a lot of you. Put a wall in front of me and I'll climb it. You can't go wrong with that type of attitude.
432479,danc,2010-02-12 01:30:00,4677," It used to be the same here years ago but now you have to write an aptitude test to get in. Either way, if you don't produce, you don't work. You don't work for the union. You work for a company. Once the Dads are retired, produce or sit at home. I'm a foreman in our local and I couldn't get my son (if I had one) a job without going through the process. Times have changed."
432483,ketchenany,2010-02-12 01:34:00,3229,"  Cliff, I know where you are coming from. I started an apprenticeship in '68 with NO knowledge of the typography trade; went back to school studied and learned and learned on the job. I have never looked back since and the only time I've had off is my earned holidays. I moved into Advertising Agencies (they needed skilleded typographers) in my 40s when computer took over typesetting. I've hired my teachers after they retired, I still keep in touch with them. I have passed on my skill to whoever wanted to learn and proud to have a daughter who took marketing and was hired at two companies that I had enhanced and has herself a bright career.  If you lose your job do what it takes . . . my motto has alway been ""the best time to look for a job is when you have one""  I actually did it in '76 (when I worked midnights) and the next 15 years were the best years of my life . . ."

432521,pikehunter,2010-02-12 02:51:00,1659,"Can't say I feel a lot of sympathy for your situation, sorry to say.  You work at a trade in the construction industry so you have to take the good and  the bad. My father worked in construction. Built houses after the war, did some other things and worked as a cop too. But his favourite job was construction, steel construction, 40 years in the Iron Workers Union. Made a good living and paid his dues (besides union dues that is) and had to travel to where the work was. Sometimes other cities, other times other provinces. You have to go where the work is, either that or get out of the business.  You have a dream of a nice house, a garage and a nice truck parked outside by 40. I wish you well but some are into retirement and haven't had such luxuries, so if you succeed consider yourself fortunate.  Best of luck."

I'm not talking a cold calling only job over a phone, I'm talking about anything.  Is there a product and or brand you would stand behind and sell it?  Yes sales is hard at times  but if you have ""the gift of gab"" and are an open and honest sales person you can do well.  I'm not saying go push cars for a living (no, that's not what I do but there is nothing wrong with it) but find something that interest you and promote it.  That's what sales is.  No tie needed (well most days) just you out there pushing a product you would be more then hapy to stand behind.  My buddy know more about cars they 95% of car salesman out there and would do a great job at it, but he cannot walk up to someone in a sales aspect to bet the ball rolling.  It's just a thought...

Danc ""the big 3"" are looking nicer and nicer, i have hook ups with in the field and its definitely an option im considering. im giving myself time to ponder before i play my next move, filed for EI today yipppie. hmmmmmm....."

(thank god). its easy money and pretty decently easy work if you have a buddy. just dont go into old mental hospitals (like my uncles brother) and get caught tearing down pipes and what not. lmao!!!

432583,pike slayer,2010-02-12 04:59:00,1177,the problem is its not worth taking a 10per hour job when i'll probably get the same on EI sadly. haha justin what are you doing night?? the truck is warmed up! hahaha

Seems you will still be making the same statements and asking the same questions 20 years from now. Don't think you will get a lot of sympathy unless you get off you ass wake up and take control of your life.  But that's just my humble opinion.......

This is why ive had so many different jobs, as soon as things got slow i left and found work else where, i've worked for 3/4 of the known contractors in town already and im unsure of what my rep. is. My boss told me that we do have work coming up(next week we have a 2-3day job) and i told him i'd be there. what i was asking in this is should i sit here and wait for grass to grow or jump the fence and see if its greener on the other side."

When i was doing new homes the owners would come in and see me hanging a door or doing baseboard and would make arrangements to come back after the house was closed and do some side jobs."

432377,Radnine,2010-02-11 22:32:00,1538,"As a former tradesman who saw the light, please see the following points: - There are more people making a living out of selling the dream of apprenticeships that there are actually doing apprenticeships. - Ask everyone (usually teachers) that tells you how great the trades are how come they are not working in them anymore. - What are the rest of the ""smoking area Prophets"" doing that you went to high school with? - When your teachers and parents begged you to apply yourself, and you knew better, this is what you were setting yourself up for. - If you think it is bad now, wait until you are 45 with no pension plan and bad joints and humping shingles up a ladder when it's -20 outside. - You are young. Get an education, somewhere, and get on with making a decent life for yourself while you still can. - Before everyone comes down on me like a ton of bricks, I went from a spotty 50 grand a year to 90 grand in 9 months with one year of education.

It's not anywhere near as bad as some of the guys on here are making it seem.  And for a job that starts you at 25$ an hour PLUS benefits and pension in a Union is a pretty damned good deal.  As for dying at 55....I work with about 20 retired ASI Millwrights...I assure you the coot's are no where close to dead.

432408,danc,2010-02-11 23:39:00,4677," You said a lot right there. There's a reason that they are called ""the big three"". I've been in sheet metal  (hvac) for 33 years now and have been out of work for about 8 months during that time. Most of that time off was appreciated too. Most of my coworkers can say the same. Presently I am contemplating taking on an hvac foreman's job in Red Lake. Great fishing you say? Perhaps, but I won't have time to fish up there. The job is 21 days straight of 10 hours work per day, then home for 4 days and back I go again for another 21 day stint . The job will last for 6 or 7 months. I'll gross about 4 grand per week, clear over 2 grand, pay a ton of income tax and get a huge tax return next year. Do the math. That's over 100 grand in half a year. Oil sands wages in Ontario. That's the kind of opportunities a good trade job will present to you. Sure, there's sacrifices. But you got to do what you got to do.  This is not the first time that I've encouraged the younger guys on OFC to take up a trade and to do it wisely. By ""wisely"", I mean to take a close look at the big 3, and work union. You'll never be out of work. You may have to travel at times, and make sacrifices like I've mentioned, but you'll never starve. Get in early enough and you can retire in your mid 50's with a great pension. Ontario will be starving for tradesmen in the near future. The world is yours if you don't mind putting in a hard days work and getting your clothes dirty. Good luck."

432463,Big Cliff,2010-02-12 01:05:00,6899,"Just because you want to be a carpenter or cabnet maker don't tie yourself down. A few years ago I found myself out of work with no warning. Jobs in my field were very few and far between in this area so I went and took an aptitude test and got a big surprise, turned out I was well suited to a couple of things I never would have thought of.  Getting an apprenticeship wasn't going to be easy, I was 60 years old so I went to work finding myself a job, found out what incentive programs were available for a perspective employer. Got all the necessary forms filled out for him so all he had to do was sign them and bingo, I had a job and an apprenticeship.  I worked my but off, went to school, studied whenever I got the chance and learned, learned, learned. I ended up with a 92.5% GPA in school. Earned the trust and respect of my employer and fellow workers some of whom had 20+ years experience on me in the trade. I made sure I was always early for work, did things for the betterment of the company that were outside of my job description. Next thing I knew I got a $1000.00 performance bonus and had keys to the shop.  Being a small engine mechanic in a rural community the work is very seasional and this winter there just isn't any work so I got laid off. Instead of sitting around feeling sorry for myself I started talking to everyone I know, two days later I had a new job, not in my trade but somewhat related with transferable skills and at a lot more money. To top it all off I have two job offers starting in March @ 25% more than I was making before I got laid off. Don't look at the lay off as a negitive thing, look at it as an opportunity and make something positive out of it.  When life hands you a bowl full of lemons, make lemonade."
432296,pike slayer,2010-02-11 18:25:00,1177,"So i'm fustrated and i don't know what to do. i'm layed off work AGAIN! i'm 22 i've been layed off probably 6-7 times now. i work in the carpentry field and its vvverryy unstable work atleast for an apprentice. I'm a second year carpenter with close to 6000 hours and second year cabinetmaker with 2500 hours. I've worked 4-5 different jobs and none seem to be getting me anywhere but layed off. Most times i just go look for another job right away cause i cant stand being on E.I not that im not loyal, gotta do what you gotta do. My boss now tells me we have work coming up but not enough to get my 40hours a week till atleast spring. i've been in this situation to many times and i dont seem to be going anywhere soon. When i was in high school they really pushed to get into the trades and i listened. They told me that i'd do my 4year apprenticeship get my papers by 21 and be making 30 something per hour. Sounds great!! Well that was when i was 18 and i'll be 23 this summer and i'm looking where i am. still at home, old truck in the driveway, no real debt but seem to be stuck in a ""hole"" that i cant seem to get out of. i have dreams/ goals that seem to be fading and they arent very big ones. i dont set the bar to high. all i ask is for a steady job with a small house and garage with a decent truck in the driveway. and at the rate things are going i might achieve this by age 40! i dont want to be 40 living at home with the parents. i see my buddys in electrical, plumbing, HVAC, etc and they never seem to be out of work and make alot more then me and well i dont get it carpenters gotta know the most as to whats going on when building homes, buildings, etc because they have to think about those trades and how its all gonna work. i dont wanna just give a little cry story to you guys. just looking for some guidance. wondering if others were in the same boat?? what should i do? just stick with it and hope for a good break? talk to my other trades buddies and see if i can get on with electrical or plumbing and start from the bottom again? do something totally different??? i'm not the sharpest tool in the drawer and i never did well in school and did the bare min to do carpentry. and yes i know theres not cant!! im young and can do anything if i apply myself. just to what!?! what to do!?"

432301,Syn,2010-02-11 18:44:00,519,+1 Forces.ca browse through the trades section. Even if you did a five year contract you walk away with eduction+experience+money. That's my plan.
432302,jayess,2010-02-11 18:45:00,187,"i see you're from the sault. could it be a geographical issue? might be more work down south of ya in the GTA (if you could handle living there).  my old man's a carpenter and i've seen the same thing with him. he hasn't had a steady job for over 15 years, lot of moving around across different jobs but the union always has something come up for him.... he may not have a steady work year, but he'll still get his $60K+ through overtime the nuke plants around here during shutdowns.  i'll tell you this much. i wouldn't hang around your neck of the woods much longer. 7 jobs is enough to tell me to get the heck outta there. you can only hope for something to come along for so long..."

If the Soo is where you want to stay I'd push hard and try and get one of these jobs:  http://www.ofm.gov.on.ca/english/Education...firefighter.asp  http://www.firetraining.ca/  At least that's what I'd do if was 22 again, single and in your situation."

432329,Twocoda,2010-02-11 20:21:00,4130,my son was in the same position ....except I was his boss ....with the times the way they are in our area  ( getting better though).... i sent him out west ...twice to work....first time to Calgary....then when things picked up here ...he came back for a year ....but found he loves the west....( kinda part of my plan)...and decided to move back on his own ...this time to Edmonton....him being a carpenter as well ...hasnt stopped working his 40 plus hour regular job and pulling in weekend work on the side for his play toys....im happy he is doing very well for himself ....  Bad points ....i lost my fishing partner to the west... Good points....i lost my fishing partner to the west and can visit ...  Take on some side work to get you through the slow times...spring isnt that far away ... You say your a cabinet maker ...take the EI as a sourse of income ....and hone your skills in cabinet making during the winter...its only going to make you more valuable in the peak times... im sure if you look hard enough ...you can find some framing jobs .....  lay-offs are mere opportunities to force you to open up shop for yourself....the first step is the biggest but in retrospect ...it aint big at all  Good Luck
432331,Flappn,2010-02-11 20:33:00,245,Don't get stressed! Like some others mentioned maybe look to a new Trade and don't think about what you have done and all the hours you spent doing it...think of it as a base to get you further in your new career. I have worked for the same company for 11 years (IT) I have debt and a family...but I tell ya I am very very seriously thinking about changing careers and retooling..only prb is I should have don it when I was 23. Your only 23 RELAX...but don't wait!!!
432332,Headhunter,2010-02-11 20:34:00,5703,"I am hearing way to much ""I can't/I won't coming from someone who really does want to succeed! The attitude I am reading the O.P's posts does not ring positive at all... yes you may be frustrated, you may feel that the world is against you, but you will simply turn off any and all potential employers with the negativity, whether it's real or only a perception. As you can see from this thread, there are many in similar situations as your, with substancially more on the line than you... 1. whining on a fishing board is a waste of time 2. the phone book is your friend... use it 3. the word ""no"" should not be in your current vocabulary 4. look into gov. sponsored education programs 5. take any job you can get as you are much more employable when you are working than when you are not 6. look at any and all available opportunties locally within the various levels of government 7. CUT THE CHORD! HH"
432333,gdelongchamp,2010-02-11 20:36:00,199,"That is one problem with colleges. You have a dream and that's what they want to hear. Sure they will put you through school, sure they will help you get that trade but what they don't tell you is they need you in school so that they can get additional operating funds, grants etc. It doesnt matter that their may not be many jobs out there they want you in school.  On the other hand you also have to do your research and find out what the hot trades are these days. And whether these trades can support you with year round work.  I was a miner by trade and never had problems getting work but had to be willing to go where the work was. Somewhere in Ontario and Canada there is demand for carpenters. But full time year round work is another issue altogether.  A mining company may have on staff two hundred miners, fifty diesel mechanics, fifteen electricians and ten millrights but usually only one or two carpenters, and maybe one certified nat. gas fitter. However in a fast growing community the opposite is the norm. There is nothing wrong with the trade you are experienced in but you need to go where the work is. Read newspapers etc. and find our where the growing communities are. The Soo is not one of them. Alberta was, but is not at the moment. Sask. seems to be the hot province for jobs. But you have to do your research before you commit to any particular area or province.  Solopaddler mentioned Yellowknife. It's a gold mining town with similarities to Kenora but Kenora is a pulp & paper town along with tourism. Yellowknife has very long winters and probably little demand for carpenters as housing will primarily be focused on const  of stacked units not necessarily with concrete and steel though as it's expensive to ship up there. But there are no wood manufacturers either as the thin treeline can not support harvesting lumber to build housing.  Yellowkife is a very expensive town to live in but that may have changed now.  There is a demand now for auto mechanics for larger vehicles, double and triple axle trucks, etc.  If there is no work in carpentry then there won't be any in plumbing and electrical either. Those three work hand in hand.  Can I suggest open pit mines and haulage trucks and drills? Mining is another but not in Sudbury right now. Red Lake sounds like the place for you but you have to love fishing and the outdoors. New mines coming on stream and old mines expanding. But small towns have a boom and bust cycle so pick and choose carefully.  Good luck."
432336,Fang,2010-02-11 20:43:00,1330,They have been building houses in Milton for the last 2 years non stop.
432337,solopaddler,2010-02-11 20:46:00,8605,  Yeah I wasn't thinking carpentry at all when I mentioned Yellowknife. My buddy (Drifter-016 on the board) moved up there a few years ago and is doing very well. Wages and benefits are much higher up there than they are down south if you can find your niche.
432339,redneck666,2010-02-11 20:48:00,563,"essar!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! im tellin ya dude, go to the college. get your one year or two year course. one year is industrial mechanic, two year is millwright. sign up, get your math booklet deal on the go for grade 12 math. you'll be done that and hopefully in the college by next year. and if you apply yourself you'll more than likely get scouted by the essar guys and be in the plant even before your done school. which you still will have to finish. like i already told you all of this, E.I. should pay for most of your schooling..... text books etc.  just a little bit MORE of a push, lol. any more questions hit me up on msn or somethin.

432350,Jigger,2010-02-11 21:06:00,1237,"I'd watch the wording with carpenters needing to know the most out of all the trades. We all know that the plumbing holds the worlds buildings together.  Having 6000hrs is a good thing if you wanted to start a new trade. You can take some of your hrs and apply them to a new apprenticeship if thats what you want to do. That being said, if you do like the trade you're in, you may have to follow the advice other posters before me have given you. Move to where the work is. Look online, telephone book, anywhere you can make a contact or apply for a job.Take as many upgrade courses as you can and get as much practical knowledge as you can so that you have just THAT much more you can offer potential employers.  Being in the trades doesn't guarantee you a job for life. Theres high times and really low times. Get used to it. Good luck."
432353,archie_james_c,2010-02-11 21:11:00,618, Thats exactly what I'm doing right now. And I'm permit Millwrighting and Labouring for SIS right now. Trying also to get into the 1425 MW Union but theres a loooooooooong waiting list right now.  Gavin you gotta realize you're not the only one not working 40 a week right now....
432354,Guest gbfisher,2010-02-11 21:11:00,0,"In the trades and only laid off 6 or 7 times now? Jobs usually last if the work is there. When a job nears completion, start looking for more work. Other trades go through the same thing. Even union workers. Try starting your own business."
432359,redneck666,2010-02-11 21:28:00,563,"  you know? hes right too! get some of that ""handyman"" or backyard work done. theres always someone around town lookin for a cheap fix to some problem."
432368,smitter,2010-02-11 21:56:00,106,"I sympathize Worm Dangler, the job scene in this town can be tough. I've been incredibly lucky work wise in the Soo, especially since I work in a very specialized field.  I understand why you don't want to leave town, I've lived all over this country and I've never found a city with this combination of friendly people, affordable housing and fantastic fishing. Of course part of the reason why the housing is so affordable, is the dodgy job market.  When I graduated college, I had a hard time finding work so I went out to Alberta, it's different now, but when I was there they were practically handing out jobs at the airport. I worked there for a while, and took the experience and used it to get where I wanted to be.  My only advice would be to keep moving forward. Whatever you decide to do, do something. There is nothing worse than sitting at home waiting for something to happen for you. You've got to go out and make something happen for yourself."
