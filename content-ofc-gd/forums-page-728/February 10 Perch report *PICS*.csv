Kelli and I headed south of our laker grounds in search of those tasty little striped fish.  Got to the lake at 7:15 and started in 25 fow.  Lots of fish around, but all averaging 6-8 inches.  Moved to 32 and hit the jackpot.  From 8am - 1pm there was never a blank screen on the vex and Kelli and I caught fish every drop.  We fished the bottom with small tubes, scud bugs and fished for the suspended fish with a small smelt pattern jig.  Landed close to 200 fish and kept 30 a piece. No big fish, but a LOT in the 9-11 inch range and about a half dozen 12's.  PErch is stocked up for a while, time to get back after the ""real fish""  Thanks for reading    "
