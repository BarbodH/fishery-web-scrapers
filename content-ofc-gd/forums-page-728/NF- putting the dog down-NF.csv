432233,Dutchy,2010-02-11 15:54:00,416," From what I can see, it would appear that it is not legal, but people do it anyway. That about sums it up.  You asked an emotional question, what did you really expect you would get in the way of answers?"
432234,BillM,2010-02-11 16:06:00,17367," Dude, you gotta come up with a better lie then that.  In your original post you complain about the vet charge, then you come back with a reply like this?  Seriously?"
432235,Dusky,2010-02-11 16:07:00,310,"Well legality and ethics does not come hands in hand at times. Even if this is legal, not sure how ethical this would be."
432238,bigfish1965,2010-02-11 16:13:00,3382,"I think we learned a lesson here. If you are going to ask a question that one would reasonably expect to produce an emotional response...don't be surprised when you get it. And proposing hypothetical situations should include some background info so that we don't think things other than what is going on.  The original question should have been..I had the guy I know tell me he shot his own dog for (insert reason here). Is that even legal?  We're all big dog lovers here so I do not think the responses were out of bounds at all. That being said, we shall close this down as per the OP's request."
431965,BUSTER,2010-02-10 21:57:00,1336,"Question .....and just a question that a few of us were having a discussion about...  Is it legal to put your own dog down on the farm via firearm of significant caliber in ONTARIO ONLY?  Iam talking about an old hound dog who's day has come .not some young pup because you dont want it any more.  the Vet wants close to $300.00 to Euthanize  not looking for your opinion, only wanting to know if its legal?"
431971,Terry,2010-02-10 22:11:00,14456,"on a farm, it seems so    http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livest...thanasia_cc.htm  The decision to humanely end the life of an animal may be necessary in          cases of severe injury or disease or as a result of disasters such as          fire or flood. On-farm euthanasia may be the most practical and humane          way for a livestock producer to relieve an animal's pain and suffering          if it is unfit to travel, or to prevent drug residues from entering the          food supply.  Whenever possible, livestock producers should consult with a veterinarian          before deciding to euthanize an animal. The following questions will help          in deciding whether to treat, slaughter or euthanize an animal that is          injured, extremely weak or disabled:    Methods of Euthanasia Euthanasia must be performed in a way that minimizes fear and anxiety          in the animal. Good stockmanship practice dictates that producers have          an ethical and moral responsibility to provide a humane death for animals          in their care, without causing additional pain or suffering.  There are three basic methods appropriate for on-farm euthanasia: overdose          by barbiturate; stunning with a penetrating captive bolt, followed by          bleed-out; and gunshot. Each method has advantages and disadvantages.          Euthanasia by barbiturate overdose must be performed by a veterinarian.          Producers who choose the captive bolt pistol or gunshot method must take          precautions to prevent serious injury to themselves and others.  To choose the most appropriate method for your operation, consider human          safety, animal welfare, required skills, costs and other factors.  Table 1 outlines the three methods and considerations for each.

The same anatomical targets and penetration angles          are used for both a penetrating captive bolt pistol and a firearm (see          Figure 1 and Figure 2).  Penetrating Captive Bolt   Gunshot  [*]Hold the firearm 5-25 cm (2-10 in.) from the target site. To avoid            personal injury, do NOT place the firearm muzzle against the animal's            skull. Aim the shot down the line of the spine so that the bullet will            enter the brain stem (the beginning of the spinal cord), and shoot. [*]Be careful to avoid injury from thrashing limbs when the animal collapses.  Target Site and Penetration Angle        For cattle older than six months, the captive bolt or gunshot should          penetrate the skull at the intersection of lines extending from the lower          base of each side of the horn bed to the inside corner of the opposite          eye as shown in Figure 1."

431978,bassjnkie,2010-02-10 22:19:00,1101,I paid $350 to put down my 4 year dog last year at the vet. I'm a hunter and could not see myself shooting my pal. But that's me.

432012,smally21,2010-02-10 23:49:00,993,"my understanding is it is not.  the family dog is considered a 'companion animal', and its treatment is different than that of 'livestock' - which is a commodity with essentially no rights.  not out of any law book i'm afraid, just my recollection of a previous discussion.  it is legal to do all kinds of things to cows and pigs that would be considered inhumane to our pets, including slaughter and consumption.  sorry to hear about yer pooch."
432114,Sinker,2010-02-11 03:14:00,8692,"Here's my opinion:   1. If its the right thing for the dog, do it. 2. If it feels right to you, do it.  Legal or not, I don't know, but if it was me and the dog had run its course, and was suffering...........  Putting down his dog is one of the hardest things a man has to do.  S."
432115,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-11 03:16:00,0,i have liked my past dogs more than i like most people.  i sure as hell could never shoot my dog.  especially not to save a buck.
432126,BillM,2010-02-11 03:38:00,17367,Nothing like shooting your companion in the head after 15-20years of great service.

432134,Dutchy,2010-02-11 04:31:00,416,"From what I have read, it is not legal. A farmer can shoot a dog only if it is threatening livestock. A dog is not classified as livestock so the rules Terry mentioned are not applicable.  But I could be wrong."
432136,irishfield,2010-02-11 04:37:00,26272,"Do what ever you, or whom ever, has to do Brad. It was the only option for a good portion of the last century... but like was pointed out to me, back when, ""what if you miss"". Take him to the vet.. I'll send you the money!"
432137,bigfish1965,2010-02-11 04:38:00,3382,"From what I recall...you can shoot your dog in the case of an immediate and acute suffering (i.e. hit by a car and death is imminent) but for other chronic issues like old age, etc. it has to be done by a vet. This prevents Jim-Bob from opening his own $20 euthanasia service. Talk to your vet about the price. Euthanol isn't too terribly expensive."
432142,Stern Rules,2010-02-11 05:09:00,342,"I'd pay the $300 vet bill before I'd shoot my dog. If you loved that dog, you owe it to him. A gun shot might be quick and he might die immediately but I couldn't do it to mans best friend. I just couldn't. I can understand not wanting to pay that much, which I think is too much, but it's your dog. Don't do it."
432164,blaque,2010-02-11 12:55:00,2419,"$300 bucks or not.........ya take that dog in to be put down softly and humanely while your holding his/her paw for their last moments as a last gesture of comfort for the animal. Not standing a foot away from them with your finger on a trigger. If moneys an issue because you just dont feel like spending $300 psssshh........if moneys an issue because its just not there.....borrow , beg, or steal."

However, he did bring the dog back for burial rather than have the vet handle the final details.  Not sure if this is an option for you or one you explored yet. Michael"
432186,BUSTER,2010-02-11 13:40:00,1336,"You guys have it all wrong..  This is a question being asked if it's legal or not  This isnt a thread about if you'd do it or not..if its right or if it's wrong, not a question of if you have the money or dont want to spend the money etc.....  the discussion is if someone was to do this would it be legal?  thats all folks nothing more.  If you asked your neighbour how old rufus is doing and he said that he had to bring him to the farm and put him down, is that legal?  nothing more than that people."
432189,Jer,2010-02-11 13:54:00,1426,"My guess is that on the farm the triple S rule applies...shoot, shovel and shut up."

432210,bigbuck,2010-02-11 14:58:00,2449,"It's tough to put down an old friend. I had my dog put down a few years back at 12 years of age, his back legs were paralyzed by hip dysplasia and arthritis. If you are out on the farm and can actually look him in the eyes when you pull the trigger, do it. As for it being legal I'm not sure but I don't think too many farmers in this great province pay for euthanasia. Most old dogs tend to 'disappear'. I spent my summers growing up on a farm and none of the neighbours took their dogs to the vet to be put down."
432221,torco,2010-02-11 15:26:00,656,I suggest if you truly want to know if its legal or not you consult a legal expert like a lawyer and not a fishing forum because ultimately you will get a lot of opinion that although valid in a moral or ethical debate may not steer you to the correct legal decision unless a lawyer is on the board and takes the time to research the answer and post for free.  I'm sure its something that is done whether its deemed legal or not.  This kind of post is a can of worms for a forum discussion.
432227,Governator,2010-02-11 15:39:00,879,  I agree although to consult a lawyer he'd probably have to pay more than the cost to euthanize.  If it feels right to you and if it's legal than do what you feel is right.  I know it's not up for debate and you're not seeking advice but there is just no way I could turn a gun on my own dog.  It would be too visual for me to take.
