431433,brifishrgy,2010-02-09 17:15:00,559,Planning on hitting the ice for a couple days .. Wend/Thurs .. if you had a couple days to fish where would ya go .. I know where to go on Simcoe so if you pick Quinte let me know where so I can get into some nice sized eyes (only fished there in the fall)
431445,cityfisher,2010-02-09 18:08:00,959,id do quinte since i live close by to simcoe... id stick to big bay as other areas are NEVER really SAFE....
432589,ciscokid,2010-02-12 05:17:00,52,"  What do you mean the other areas are never really safe? If the ice conditions are supposed to be good should it be alright? Im asking cause i plan on heading over to one of those other areas, sorta in the narrows actually, this weekend for my first time."
432600,tknohpy,2010-02-12 11:09:00,162,I am heading to Quinte this weekend and will be fishing off Huffs Road.  Look for flats adjacent to deeper water.
432697,brifishrgy,2010-02-12 18:14:00,559,Good luck Grateful fisher .. I never did make it out on Wend .. didnt feel like sitting in traffic to get thru Toronto because of that bit of snow we got
