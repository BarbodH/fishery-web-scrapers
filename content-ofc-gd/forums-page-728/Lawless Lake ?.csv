I have been offered a cabin on Lawless lake ( Quebec) to use this summer, just wondering if there is any good fish in the lake or a short drive from the lake. Just looking for a good place to go for two weeks in July with the family within about 3 hours of Chesterville Ontario. Thanks to anyone that will respond."
