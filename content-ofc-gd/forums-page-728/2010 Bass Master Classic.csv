431878,mbac31,2010-02-10 18:06:00,904,Jones or Duckett
431880,e-z-out,2010-02-10 18:14:00,1052,Kevin VanDam or Mark Tucker
431881,I'mHooked,2010-02-10 18:15:00,525,Duckett.  It's on the same lake Duckett won it on in 2007.
431884,diggyj,2010-02-10 18:28:00,548, Right and Martens was runner-up in 02.
431887,Harrison,2010-02-10 18:34:00,2202,"Well, if we are guessing two-  Iaconelli or Hackney"
431888,maybo,2010-02-10 18:38:00,86,KVD
431894,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-10 18:54:00,3761,I'm pullin for Denny Brauer and Reese like last year.
431897,ohhenrygsr,2010-02-10 19:12:00,947,For Sure Michael Iaconelli
431899,dheitzner,2010-02-10 19:17:00,314,"KVD is always a threat, but Boyd Duckett or Kelly Jordan also have a good shot IMO."
431900,ColdH20guy,2010-02-10 19:18:00,312,Alton Jones......
431983,smitter,2010-02-10 22:28:00,106,"I'm absolutely interested in watching.  From what I know of Bass Pro fishing, which isn't much, I'll be cheering for Kevin VanDam to win and cheering for Mike Iaconelli to fall out of his boat.   I've never  watched a Bassmaster on TV, what channel is it on? Can I watch it on TSN or a ""basic"" cable network, or do I have to have WFN?"
431990,The Urban Fisherman,2010-02-10 22:58:00,2050,"I don't know who's going to win, but what I can tell you is my flight leaves for Birmingham on thursday morning!"
431995,ColdH20guy,2010-02-10 23:07:00,312," Unless you get ESPN2, you'll have to catch it on the web....unfortunately like the rest of us"
432096,Ben_Daniels,2010-02-11 02:26:00,435,Something tells me its Gerald Swindle's year...
432274,Mark Kulik,2010-02-11 17:23:00,348,"KVD 1st choice, but Hackneys on a tear, Mark Menendez is my favourite, I would love to see him win!"
432367,charlesn,2010-02-11 21:56:00,551,Matt Herren is my pick.  I don't think he'll get the spectator traffic a lot of the others mentioned will get on day 1 and he's a local that knows the lake as good as anyone.
432372,spinnerbaitking,2010-02-11 22:10:00,1622,"KVD sounds confident  , Aaron Martens"
432543,BITEME,2010-02-12 03:23:00,1968, You should make a plan to see the DAWG
432554,uglyfish,2010-02-12 03:42:00,981,"KVD, greg hackney, mike iaconelli, boyd duckett.  conditions are not gonna be pleasant for them there. supposed to be cold. whoever can adjust and find the bite will be the one to win.  KVD is simply amazing and finds ways to win events. he is always a threat. he had a 9oz lead goin into the final day of the 2007 classic on lay lake and lost to boyd duckett.  boyd duckett is in his home lake, won the classic in '07 there. he may have a little better knowledge then some guys, but with the winter they had everyone is gonna be tryin to find fish.  mike iaconelli is a finesse master. if he can find the fish in the cold conditions, he should get them to bite.  greg hackney has been hot. he won the FLW championship and was up there in some other events. he likes the jig, and will be a threat if he finds some fish. he should get some big bites and contend as well."
