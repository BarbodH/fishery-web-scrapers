432206,Jackie,2010-02-11 14:45:00,124,"I'm planning to head to the Belleville area to try my luck for some walleye on Sunday.  Can someone tell me:  1. Is the ice safe to walk out?  I'm guessing it's not safe to drive an SUV out. 2. Since I will be walking, is there any access point where I can park and is close to the fishing ground (say within 30min walk)? 3. Where can I get minnows along the way (from Toronto)?  I am guessing medium sized shiners would be good?  Thanks all for your help.  Jackie"
