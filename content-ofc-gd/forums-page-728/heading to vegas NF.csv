431798,anders,2010-02-10 14:07:00,1168,"Classic movie opening!  Vegas is something else, and both times i have been there, i played it as we went...no point in trying to really follow an agenda.  Drinks are free if you are gambling or look like it, but be sure to tip to get them to keep on funneling the alcohol and never order just 1 drink at a time for a waitress...order a couple, specially if they are free.  1 thing to check out if you not squimish is the Body exhibit, first time i was there it was at the Tropicana and the last time it was at the Luxor...really really something to see.  All real humans that have died and bodies went to this exhibit to show EVERYTHING!  it was amazing!  Dont get caught up in the ""got a minute"" line....they are the workers that keep trying to peddle time shares and such...it gets annoying...all you have to say is that its my last night and leaving tomorrow and they instantly shut up and move on...otherwise they pester you.  If you do have time, go check out the Ferrari's at the wynn...will not be disappointed, and Freemont street....no vegas trip is complete without a freemont trip."

431868,irishfield,2010-02-10 17:45:00,26272,If you need to pay for it lads.. maybe you ARE uglier than your avatar!!  Don't get off the main strip onto the back streets...
431870,mpt,2010-02-10 17:50:00,158,"If you rent a car you'll see more casinos. Valet park for $2. There are major streets running paralel to the strip which remain lightly traveled. the strip is usually very busy, especially at night when the orange barrels come out. Most consruction work is done at night because the sun is a real bear out there. Anyway use the paralel streets to get close to any casino you want to experience and then go to the strip and use the valet parking for the casino. If you don't want a car there's a monorail from MGM along the strip I think to Balley's. Many casinos are associated and they will have shuttles amongst them. Across the street from MGM is NY/NY and they have a nice roller coaster but don't miss the roller coaster on top of the Stratus. My kids said it was quite exciting. If the coaster is down they still have a demon drop. Freemont street also."
431882,crappieperchhunter,2010-02-10 18:24:00,2582,Hoover Dam used to be a must stop for me. The tour used to take you right inside the dam. I just loved seeing all that stuff up close and experiencing the size and what it took way back then to accomplish such a feat. You can not fully appreciate it until you are way down at water level below the dam looking up. I have been told that since 911 this tour in not available. If it is however I highly recommend it if you are into that stuff.  Used to always take a plane trip to view the Grand Canyon. Never got bored of that either. Irish might even be able to swing something there  If your into the cards. See if you can get into a friendly casino sponsored blackjack tournament.  $20 enter fee back then and they gave you $500 worth of fake chips to play with. Made it to a final table once and came it 3RD. Most fun I have ever had playing cards in a casino..and it only cost me $20.  If you play the one armed bandits...chat it up with some of the ladies working the floor. They can tell you what machines pay more regularly then others. My buddy got a juicy tip on our first trip and we always but $20 each in this one machine when we went down for breakfast in the morning. Every day we did this and one of us always made enough to have a free day for the rest of that day.  The thing I absolutely loved the most however was how nice the weather is with no humidity. 112 was my warmest day there...not a bead of sweat. Hot but not uncomfortable. When they talk here of the temp being 75 but the humid x makes it feel like 90 I just laugh. Give me 90 in the desert over 75 in Ontario anyday.
431898,Harrison,2010-02-10 19:14:00,2202,"$3 one deck blackjack at the Imperial Palace. $20 buy in poker T at the Flamingo.  Bring some moola, everything in Vegas is $$$$.  Have to hit the club in the Hard Rock, great place, lots of scenery.  Saw Paris Hilton there, not even close to the hottest in the club.  If appraoched in the club by a hot gal, she sees $$$.  IF you approach and she's into you, she see's $$$.  Besides that... its one of the best places on earth. Have fun."
432064,douG,2010-02-11 01:37:00,2693,"All plastic, not one of the best places on earth.  The whole place is a zero sum game."
432101,Dutch,2010-02-11 02:39:00,831,"Some tips:  Don't play slots - they keep the casinos in business.  Sign up for as many frequent player cards as possible - they sometimes have a free gift or give you free matched slot play - this is the only time it is permissable to play slots.  The players cards are also used for the free shuttles from one casino to another (sister hotels).  You should be able to get all up and down the strip for free.  No need for a car or taxi in Vegas.  Time goes by very fast, you won't ahve a lot of time to do many things, so you are doing a good thing by reasearching.  Pick the top 2-3 things and go at it.  I never heard about the gun place.  I would have been there in a heartbeat.  Don't do timeshares - the free shows aren't worth the hassle.  If you play poker, you can make a lot of money in Vegas at the lower limit tables if you are even close to a decent player.  Wait for your spots and play semi-tight, aggressive.  There is a place called the Gold Coast across from the Rio, off the strip.  Take a shuttle from Harrahs or some other sister Hotel to the Rio and walk across the street.  The absolute best ""real"" Chinese food (not buffet) I have ever had - restaurant is called Ping-Pang-Pong - reasonable priced too, $10 - $15 per person.  Their buffet is good too and reasonable $10 lunch, $15 dinner.  THe rio was $25 - $40, I think.  We saw Elton John at Caesar's Palace - not cheap, but well worth the $.  Most of the Theatres are quite intimate (2000-3500 people per show) so we did not feel the need to pay more for close tickets.  We are saving Hoover Dam for our next visit - just too much to allocate a day to on our first trip to Vegas, other things to do/see.  You'll have a great time."

432139,crappieperchhunter,2010-02-11 04:44:00,2582," We saw David Copperfield at Ceasars as well. My sister-in-law talked all week about how much she wanted to see him   Greased the guy seating us $30...this was 20 years ago...and we got seated right in the front. She even got to verify one of the locks he used for a trick. She was thrilled beyond belief. So if you are going to a once in a lifetime show, which for my sister in law it was.. I say open your wallet and grease away. Just to see the big silly smile on her face. Best $30 I ever spent."

I am not much of a gambler either(wife makes enough playin poker !!!) so I spend a good DAY in the BASSPRO which is attached  to the SILVERTON CASINO...yup that's right!!. The wife can play in the casino while you shop in BASSPRO!! It doesn't get any better.....oh, yeah it does! There is a FREE shuttle to/from Caesar's Palace to the Silverton. Go to the Silverton Casino site and find the shuttle schedule, it is free but you just thro a $5 into the driver's tip jar and he will drop you wherever you want ..if he can! This BPS has some really unique stuff that we can't get up here in Canada. Their big thing is for Striped Bass in Lake Mead. Good news is ...they use Musky /Salt water stuff for them and it is AWESOME for MUSKIES!! I always come home with something that is NOT available here!!!  FT"

Went to the range, still got the target paper downstairs...It was kinda cool, the range gave me a card, they said in case I set off the detector/sensor at the airport. (residue?? Not sure if they were kidding or not.) Went to Bass Pro, a lot like the rest, picked up a spinner that I could get anywhere, but I did catch a musky on that Vegas bait. We went to see ""Ka"" by Cirque de Soliel(??), amazing show, and if it's still there I highly recommend going to see it. Also saw Tom Jones, and although I can't believe I'm saying it, he can still put on a great show. Caught myself singing along...If you have the time, and your partner likes shopping, take as little clothing as possible. Jeans, shoes, fragrances, etc. in the outlet malls at prices  often near half what we pay here. Enjoy. Andy"

Also, among true Vegas shows is the Jubilee, which has the same show, a la topless!!  There's also the wax museum and an awesome aquarium that will blow your mind.  A plethora of clubs but my favourites were PURE and Luxxor.  PURE's in Ceasar's Palace so it would be walking distance to you.  Oh the girlies!!  I'm not a big gambler, but I like the craps tables (5-10$) cause they offer lots of play time and I don't blow the bank.  The potential for a nice payout is there too.  Be careful with the dollar pina coladas though...  They're chalk full of something, but it ain't alcohol!  Oh and if you go on a lude trip, don't steal Mike Tyson's tiger!!

I remember saying something like ""I feel a bit light headed, maybe you should drive...."" And suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and screeching and diving around the car, and a voice was screaming: ""Holy Jesus! What are these goddamn animals?"" (attorney says: ""What are you yelling about?"") Never mind, it's your turn to drive."" No point in mentioning those bats, I thought, the poor bugger will see them soon enough. We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls. Not that we needed all this for the trip, but once you get locked in a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge. And I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon."
