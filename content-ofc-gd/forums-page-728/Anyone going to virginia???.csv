420233,HTHM,2010-01-09 01:12:00,4082,"The first thing I did after posting, was talk to UPS and that is the way it appears to be going. However, a penney saved, is still in my pocket....."
420236,irishfield,2010-01-09 01:25:00,26272,Use Fedex Albert... $7 brokerage vs UPS's crown and anchor wheel !
420239,Greencoachdog,2010-01-09 01:34:00,8163,  If you really want it... money is no object!

420258,irishfield,2010-01-09 02:27:00,26272,"That happens with any carrier from time to time.. All I can tell you is normal Fedex charges $7 brokerage no matter the value. UPS can be anywhere from $15 to $90 and there's no rhyme nor reason to it! Fedex Freight... I had them here on Wednesday with a single acrylic aircraft windshield in a cardboard box.. arrived mint.. although it wasn't mine! lol... that little issue was cleared up around 3:45 PM Wednesday and the company I bought it from shipped my carton of 5 windshields that night, or Thursday am, from Pittsburg PA and I received it today at 2pm. Again in mint condition. I consider that some darn good service considering time of day to get the shipment out... the guys I bought from had to contact my import broker in Barrie.. they had to send the information back to Fedex and the border for pre-clearance etc.  A favour owed would still require customs clearance... unless the driver is real brave in this day and age to get held up at the border.  Then again.. why are we discussing this just because Albert's too cheap to just ship the stuff!!"

420301,HTHM,2010-01-09 04:12:00,4082,"Thanks to all who have chimed in on this, vinnimon esp! If it ends up being shipped, I will go FedEx. Two wise men can't be wrong, eh?"

432789,HTHM,2010-02-13 00:22:00,4082,I just wanted to publicly thank and apologize to corvette1 for A: receiving the seats and B: Forgeting to give you the Canadian Club I bought for you. I was so excited to get these seats that it slipped my mind.
432793,Billy Bob,2010-02-13 00:36:00,5865,"Don't know where Mount Hope is but as I have posted a couple of times....I am more than happy to help out my fellow Canadian Friends...I live 15 minutes from the Peace Bridge, 40 minutes from the Rainbow Bridge and less then 2 miles from the Buffalo Airport...if someone wants to use my mailing address it's OK with me...I am retired but work part time on Tuesday morning so I am pretty much available for guys to pick things up...of course when the weather turns I hope to be doing some catching....
