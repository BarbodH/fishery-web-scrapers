432729,ChrisK,2010-02-12 20:07:00,2772,My nephew Hans was lucky enough to be picked out of a group in Toronto to attend the olympics as an official for the snowboard events. He will be standing at the end gates as the boarders finish their runs. Keep an eye out for him..... He is is now there grooming the track in preparation for the opener. Lucky kid !! Looks like they got enough snow to get things underway    Cheers !!
