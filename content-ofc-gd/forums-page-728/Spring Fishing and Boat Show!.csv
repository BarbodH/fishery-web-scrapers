Would like to get a shirt or hat, will they be sold there?  Anyway I'll be the guy (pretty sure not the only one) walking around all doe eyed in awe of all the beauty that is fishing gear!!  p.s.  any info on how to acquire a shirt or other OFC gear would be appreciated"
427254,TJQ,2010-01-29 16:17:00,7806,"LOL.. no booth this year, If your looking for gear go here:  http://www.ofnstore.com"

427308,diggyj,2010-01-29 19:18:00,548,"Went last year and found it to be quite lame. Not that many great deals. Too small, won't be going this year, will wait for the big show.  Dirk"
427316,hirk,2010-01-29 19:59:00,571,"Dirk I would guess it will be a better show this yr. than last if for nothing else but because the sportsman show has moved to a new venue,the sportsman show is the ""jack of all trades master of none"" as far as shows go.The fishing show focus is more on seminars and showing new products,there are some deals but retailers can't pay huge floor space costs and then give everything away either."
427318,greyhawk,2010-01-29 20:27:00,33,"I certainly would like to go, but outside of the great seminars, for which I would like to see a schedule, I've heard that the vendors for gear will be scarce. In fact, I've been told, many manufacturers of fishing gear will also be non-existent. Any info out there that could set me straight on these allegations is appreciated."
427350,Roy,2010-01-29 22:11:00,13728," You're correct, they ARE allegations. Check your sources again."
427367,hirk,2010-01-29 23:20:00,571,"The retail space is all booked up,I was on a waiting list.As far as manufactures are concerned I think other than the odd ""they aren't coming"" due too politics relating to the sportsman show there will be good representation by them.So don't buy into the rumor bud."
427370,TJQ,2010-01-29 23:36:00,7806,Hey Hirk... whats your booth number??
426450,Roy,2010-01-27 22:22:00,13728,"There are 16 days left till the Spring fishing and Boat Show, February 12 to 15 at the International Centre, 6900 Airport Rd., Mississauga.

It's a long weekend too  for Ontario folks. Unfortunately I have to be back home on Sunday but I'll surely make the best of Saturday the 13th there.  Who's going?"

It will be a great day and hopefully Mike has a great turnout for what we hope will be an anual event. This has got to be the best way to get kids interested in fishing. So, if you can't make it to the Spring Fishing Show on Saturday, be sure to bring your whole family along to this event.  For those of you going to the Spring Fishing Show on Sunday, I will see you there! Hope to see Pete Maina and Jim Saric seminar. I'm just not too sure when they have the stage. I know, I know, better say Dave Mercer too, gheesh! ha ha ha Looking forward to picking on Big Jim too!"
