432187,Headhunter,2010-02-11 13:42:00,5703,"Doc, Get some Freezes and pop them in the freezer... the little ones, not the big ones... give'm to the kid... un-opened! They can't chew throught the plastic and will give relief Toast some bagels, cut them up into bite size wedges and freeze them... give'm to the kid Get a soft wash cloth, soak it with water and freeze it in a zip lock bag... give it to the kid... All this will pass, but these remedy's don't require any chemicals for your child. HH  PS... a rubber mallet will not leave a mark... just sayin!"
432188,Roy,2010-02-11 13:51:00,13728,And as the saying goes...silence is golden and duct tape is silver.

My son is going to be 10 years old soon...I don't even remember the teething debacle...so I guess that means that yes, you will get through it and like DouG says, it won't be a blip on the radar.  Keep on keepin' on!"
432195,Headhunter,2010-02-11 14:19:00,5703,"Roy, I'm pretty sure the duct tape will stick to their gums! HH"

My wife found some naturopathic stuff but the name escapes me, it was little tablets of chamomille extract. You could try a bit of cold chamomille tea."
432212,Governator,2010-02-11 15:01:00,879,"Mine will be 6 months on the 19th.  He's yet to burst a tooth but the drool over the past month has increased ten fold and you can tell his gums are getting sore how he jams everything in there to suck on.  You hold the little bugger up and your shirt is drenched.  He was also sleeping through the night (9:30-7:30) for the last couple of months, but since last week for whatever reason he's now waking up at 4am.  A feed and back to sleep works, wife and I are just taking turns on the 4am call.  Fun times ahead I'm sure....."

432427,douG,2010-02-12 00:07:00,2693,"Dr. Sal, let me clarify my thoughts on this.  Your child, who depends on you for everything, is currently experiencing the worst pain of his life.  I remember the look from the BigKid at 6 1/2 months that said very clearly, 'I thought you looked after all this pain and need stuff for me, you are clearly not the parents I hoped you would be.  I am going to be as brave as I can, but I'm just little.'  I was frantic too.  That stuff doesn't go away for the parents, but it does go away for the kids.  They don't remember that stuff, thank goodness.  Just do what you are doing.  Ask advice from others, use what works for you, support each other, and know that at the same moment you are walking the floors with Nummer chewing on your finger, that there are very likely 100,000 families experiencing the same as you, prolly worse, in Ontario.  Best of Luck, where the heck is the owners' manual for this thing anyway.  Honey?"
432435,Cookslav,2010-02-12 00:21:00,1457,"Frozen teething ring dude. Best it can get.... Baby oragel...the premeasure swabs are even better then the loose goop. Way less messy, and easier to target the exact area... But don't rule out infant Tylenol or Advil if its bad.  Not sure if you know this but you can piggy back infant Tylenol every 4 hours over and above the Advil every 6 hours in the event its really bad, or the fever gets to high. Just make sure you follow the directions for doseage based on weight, not age... (If you don't beleive me call telehealth Ontario, or your Dr.)  Sometimes a good nights sleep for the little one can make the next day a little less intense."
432472,Headhunter,2010-02-12 01:19:00,5703,"Oh yah Doc... you can't put them back you know! I asked the Doctor and she said no!  Doug, funny and true! HH"

432639,charlesn,2010-02-12 14:35:00,551,"Teething is a temporary thing.  He'll be back to his usual self in no time.  You ain't a real dad until you've been peed on, pooped on and vomited on.  I learned the hard way to not laugh with mouth open when changing a diaper or getting up to close for a kiss on a baby that just ate exactly 1 spoonful more than her belly can hold.  It's all good.  You can sleep when you're dead.  You will miss these times in a few years - I know I already miss those days of holding a sleeping baby enjoying the quiet and therapeutic effects therein.  I'm already hearing ""daddy I can do it myself"" a lot and can see myself being completely irrelevant in about a year."
432050,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-11 01:11:00,0,"so my son has his two bottom front teeth busting through the last few days...man...i had no idea. when we first had the kid and never slept every one said ""it gets better!""...  well they must not have been around when their children went through teething!  my son, whom normally plays and smiles all day long has turned into an angry, fevered, rashed, diarrhea flowing monster!  poor guy!  it's like the wheels completely fall off when they start.  as a result, me and mom have barely slept in days, and find ourselves more tired than we have ever been!  not looking for advice, just looking for some sympathy from all you mothers and fathers out there...  cheers!"

432054,ctdd2006,2010-02-11 01:19:00,531,...it gets better!
432055,Syn,2010-02-11 01:20:00,519,Two suggestions      
432056,danbouck,2010-02-11 01:21:00,4380,"lol yep, my youngest is 1 1/2 and still doesn't sleep. After teething you get a bit of calm break but I found with my first one that between 14 - 24 months is the hardest time.  Best of luck to ya!!!"
432057,vinnimon,2010-02-11 01:21:00,2593,"Hang in there, it gets better.I have two girls 8 and 5. BTW one word of advice, Steer clear of the projectile Vomit."
432058,wuchikubo,2010-02-11 01:22:00,1114,"Ahh, the memories!  Good luck, hope you get some rest soon!"
432059,douG,2010-02-11 01:23:00,2693,"My kids are 25 and almost 23. Turning into fabulous young women.  Teething is not a big deal due to the fact that it is time-limited.  We have all survived teething as children.  As exhausted as you and your wife might be, there will be more stuff that keeps you engaged as the spawn mature.  Good Luck, Pa.  Teach em right and hope for the best.  PS:  Don't worry at all about the teething.  Poopy pants, runny noses and a little cranky will not even leave a mark, looking back a while from now.  You can get these teething rings that you can pop in the freezer.  Sore gums need some stimulation, and these work.  I've heard that rawhide bones can help, but I'm not real clear on the species.  Anbesol helps, and so does gravol in a pinch."
432063,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-11 01:35:00,4399,"Hang in there it will get better. Before you know it they`ll be all grown up and moved out before the age of 30 if your lucky,and then they will only call you when they want to borrow money,borrow the boat,borrow the tow vehicle,co-sign a loan,pay for a wedding,help with a downpayment for the first house,baby sit."
432070,alexmedic,2010-02-11 01:44:00,186,"Been there and going thru it again!  My 2nd daughter is 5 1/2 months old and it's not pretty..  A couple of suggestions:  Tempra/Motrin.  Tempra is Acetaminophen based and Motrin is ASA based.  What does that mean? Well you can give the 2 in shorter intervals (ever 2 hours) with no harm to your little one.  This will help with the discomfort as well as the fever.  Gripe Water.  We love it.  It's natural, cheap and it zonks them out.  Great for stomach aches as well.  Word of advise, get the alcohol based one.  It's just a fraction of alcohol in it and help them (and ultimately you) sleep!  Besides, just think of all the keggers he will attend in the future - you are preparing him!!  Those got us through the first time and seems to be doing the trick now.  But now I must sleep!"
432075,splashhopper,2010-02-11 01:49:00,2931,"GRAND PARENTS come in handy right about now  My inlaws are filipino... they give the teething little monsters frozen carrots to chew on  My parents are rednecks,,, they gave ME a shot of rye in my bottle   :whistling:"
432078,bigugli,2010-02-11 01:55:00,6138,"Did the Tempra thing, as advised by the MD.  Got better results from old country family remedy. Rub a little brandy on the gums. Soothes and sedates. I know its not Dr Spock, but it works."
432081,Grimace,2010-02-11 01:57:00,2020,"Same thing here man.  Hyland's Teething tablets.  Camilia Teething solution  Gripe water.   All of them are all natural.  Stay away from that numbing ambesol stuff, they swallow it and the throat goes numb and then they choke on their own drool (that's what I heard anyways).  We have 4 bottom teeth and 1 coming in on the top now.  Cheers Man"

432083,Grimace,2010-02-11 01:58:00,2020,"and of course tempra.  but that can constipate them, but it works really good when the going gets really tough for the little one."
