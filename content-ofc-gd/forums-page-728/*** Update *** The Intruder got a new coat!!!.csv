432526,Syn,2010-02-12 02:59:00,519,Looking Good! Are you really going to put 4 trebles on it? Thought the max allowed was 3 trebles.
432529,Leecher,2010-02-12 03:09:00,7832, Thanks Syn!!!  Don't know how many trebles allowed    guess I'll have to look into the regs If I exceeded.... it'll be another exhibition on the trophy wall I guess
432540,Syn,2010-02-12 03:22:00,519,  I think you might find long neck trebles if you are worried that the hooks won't cover enough area. Maybe the regs in your area are different so possibly allowed 4 trebles although I can't remember ever seeing a 4 treble inshore lure.   If you haven't top coated it and are only allowed 3 trebles you could just remove the center 2 and put one in the middle. Anyhow since you are building from scratch you might be at the experimenting stage with regards to how it will run with different size trebles and if it needs any drilling and weight filling if it is not wobbling how you like it. 4 trebles might even kill the lure action.
432545,irishfield,2010-02-12 03:27:00,26272," Legal in Ontario.. there is no ""9 point"" rule regardless of what some will try to tell you. You are allowed 4 hooks (single/double or treble) if not adding live bait to the rig."
432547,Syn,2010-02-12 03:35:00,519,"I stand corrected, thanks irishfield: ""A fishing line must not have more than four hooks attached. A hook includes a single-pointed or multiple-pointed hook on a common shaft but does not include a snagger or spring gaff. The number of hooks includes any single-pointed or multiple-pointed hooks that an assortment of lures are part of a lure.""  Also learned this: ""It is illegal to use or possess lead fishing sinkers or jigs in Canadaâ€™s national parks and wildlife areas."" http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsF...L02_165347.html  Anyhow I'd still check if 4 trebles is even worth it on that lure, trebles overlapping each other or killing the action due to weight."
432555,Leecher,2010-02-12 03:43:00,7832," Thanks Wayne!!!  I'd assume, same rules apply for Quebec   Syn, maybe 1/0 is little big for it..... might go 2/0 or even 3/0.... only way to find out is when I get to try it, 2 1/2 months from now"
432557,moparhawk,2010-02-12 03:44:00,146,Thats some excellent work Leech. Now don't leave your tackel box on the edge of the boat when you drive off!!
432560,Leecher,2010-02-12 03:53:00,7832, Thanks moparhawk!!!  I don't know if it will fit into my tackle box     but good advice!!! Thanks
