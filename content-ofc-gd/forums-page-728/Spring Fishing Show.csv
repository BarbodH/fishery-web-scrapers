Canadian Tire here in town has them for $180. Bass Pro sells them for $150. Radioworld has them for $125. Glad I waited. They had the fish tv's for $125 also. For anyone thinking of getting an ice fishing flasher, they had the Humminbird Ice 55's on for $445. Bass Pro sells them for $600. Great deal there. I would have picked one up but I really don't like flashers. Should have anyway for that price."
