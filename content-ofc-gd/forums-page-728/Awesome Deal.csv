431980,scuro2,2010-02-10 22:23:00,904,Natulist manual inflatable $99. At Angling Outfitters in Woodstock and on sale. Bought one today.
431994,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-10 23:04:00,10439, Not too bad. You get a fully auto unit for about the same price as a manual unit on sale.  Still UPS should be taken out and flogged!!!!!
431997,danbouck,2010-02-10 23:16:00,4380,The manual is on sale for under $40 as well. I'm buying 2 auto and 1 manual
432000,irishfield,2010-02-10 23:20:00,26272,$58.25 + Gst.. UPS raped me for Brokerage... when Fedx would have done that for $7 and then the tax collection on value.. total to UPS and government $107.27. Paid Defender $30 for shipping. So that said.. 6 AUTO inflaters for a total of approx $490 CDN... $81.67 Each including taxes!! ($72.27 + tax).
432011,cram,2010-02-10 23:48:00,1733,why can't they do USPS or fedex?  Is it because of the C02?
432013,irishfield,2010-02-10 23:51:00,26272,"Yep.. USPS won't ship compressed air. As for why UPS over Fedex.. American's love UPS.. and use it more than the post office down there. FedX is rarely a choice with US companies for shipping.  We should have taken a group order... one large pallet across the border on a truck.. I could have cleared that, or an entire truck load for that matter,  for only $55 with Near North Customs Brokers in Barrie!!"
432015,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-10 23:52:00,10439,"  Can't really complain, except for the raping and gouging done by those UPS scumbags!!!!"
432016,irishfield,2010-02-10 23:54:00,26272, Nope.. a great deal Dave and thanks for pointing it out. I'm gonna feel real comfortable when the gals and their friends head up the lake in canoes wearing these.. and sitting on the life jackets...
432255,Marc Thorpe,2010-02-11 16:39:00,621,"  No worries,I say take it out on the humans no matter what"
432256,danbouck,2010-02-11 16:40:00,4380,"They are out of the auto vests, still have the manuals"
432258,camillj,2010-02-11 16:42:00,1988,Sold out ....  I waited too long to get the 'bulk order' ... oh well .they moved a little over 200 units in a couple of weeks ... obviously a good deal ...
432376,Wally,2010-02-11 22:31:00,28,"Got my vests today , check the date on the Yellow Bobbin , mine were April 07"
432383,irishfield,2010-02-11 22:53:00,26272,"Yep.. just checked mine. The one i checked... the cartridge is dated 11/06.. Jacket manufactured Feb 2007.. so yah they are three years old, but I don't see it as an issue. They say to change the cartridge every three years.. but I can't see the need if it has enough pressure to show a green indicator in the little window. At least these auto's have an indicator.. my expensive Mustangs in the airplane have nothing to tell you if they are still good or not..."
431382,irishfield,2010-02-09 14:37:00,26272,"Well they ship promptly, if nothing else. I gave them the go ahead to ship UPS at 1:51 PM yesterday.. and they were already in Fort Erie Canada awaiting customs clearance last night at 9:50 pm."
431399,Wally,2010-02-09 15:15:00,28,"This is the reply I got when I asked about removing the CO2 ""Unfortunately we cannot take the C02 cartridges out of these vests (any of the auto-inflate Helly Hansen specials).""  So I went ups  ""Your vests will head out this afternoon. I apologize for the lack of shipping options this time around. We usually have several options to Canada, but that C02 cartridge issue really narrows it down. Enjoy your new vests!""   Nice , prompt , communications from Defender ."
431432,scuro2,2010-02-09 17:13:00,904,"I thought I saw them at bass pro for under $90. Is this such a great ""deal""?"
431455,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-09 18:30:00,10439,  You probably saw the manual deployment models. They require you to pull a tab to inflate. I paid about $90 for my manual vest. The fully auto vests are $150 and up. So yeah it's a smokin' deal.
431495,solopaddler,2010-02-09 19:25:00,8605,"My question to all you guys who're buying these things: How do you know 100% for certain they'll actually inflate if and when you really need them to? Fact is you don't. That's the primary reason why, although they're more comfortable to wear, I never used them on my canoe treks in the far north, opting always for a more conventional non inflatable pfd."
431498,Terry,2010-02-09 19:30:00,14456,"well you can blow them up manually to test them and it only takes a second to inflate them they are widely used with no problems, so you need to have faith just like air bags in your car and the pill your wife takes monthly.....LOL"
431504,solopaddler,2010-02-09 19:38:00,8605, Blowing them up manually only proves that when you're floundering around in ice water trying to get back in your boat or to shore you'll have a functioning pfd if you take the time to blow it up.
431545,Terry,2010-02-09 20:42:00,14456,"well yeah but that's assuming the compressed air fails and I use a floater suit when there is ice  the way is see it if people will wear it because it's light and comfortable, then they are better off then not wearing anything........ flotation wise that is"
431553,solopaddler,2010-02-09 20:50:00,8605,"  I agree. If I'm putzing around in my boat on hot summer day, then for sure. I'd be way more likely to wear one of those things. They're still better than nothing, no arguing that.  When I'm actually seriously concerned about my safety no way would I wear one."
431573,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-09 21:10:00,10439,"  Mine has a GO, NOGO guage on it as I'm sure they all do. If the guage is green you're good if it's red your not. They also have a manual inflation valve."
431582,Terry,2010-02-09 21:25:00,14456,.... if it doesn't work .... you can sue them ... well your next of kin can...LOL
431611,icedude,2010-02-09 22:38:00,459,  Thanks for the heads Up here Drifter  UPS Ground--Trackable/Traceable  69.99 all in i paid--shipment is not flagged for Customs Clearance  [email protected]  price compareable here at 200 bucks  They really should Harmonize USA/Canadian PFD devices in this man opinion  let you all know how it works out--plan on being wet in the next couple of weeks  LOL  Tight Lines  Paul
431618,ch312,2010-02-09 22:54:00,1590,a buddy of mine is selling a mustang inflatable PFD that looks like a normal fly fishing/stream vest for $60 if anyone is interested...   ill stick to the old school style
431712,CLofchik,2010-02-10 02:36:00,854," Inflatable PFD's are significantly safer than most PFD's, and almost all that are comfortable to wear for long periods. When inflated they behave more like a life jacket than a PFD, keeps your head above water where a PFD might not if you're unconcious. Not to mention they have alot more buoyancy, this thing is rated at 35lbs where most PFD's are lucky to have 16-18lbs of buoyancy.  So not only are they more comfortable, but they're also safer, especially the auto-inflate jobbies.   That is if they inflate when you need them.  And hope those super sharp hooks didn't puncture anything when the hammer handle stuck that stickbait in your vest.  Or you didn't hurt anything when you sat on it.....  Lol you're too paranoid, just have faith dood"
431724,solopaddler,2010-02-10 02:58:00,8605,"  Maybe so.  On the other hand if I happen to fall out of my canoe in a class 5 rapids, or dump it in the middle of an ice cold lake far from shore at least I don't have to worry about pulling a cord."
431776,Marc Thorpe,2010-02-10 11:28:00,621,"Hi Solopaddler, I use em with clients,although for commercial passenger vessels,they are not recognized by Transport Canada standards,TC has a couple of life vest that are approved and must be on board . But the TC inspector does recommend using them/wearing them due to their lack of bulkiness. They are recommend for pleasure crafts but not commercial passenger operators  As far as concerns to self inflatable PFD,they work,there is an indicator with 2 other safety measures in case the automatic safety does not work. The neat thing is just like a Life vest,it keeps your head out of the water  The purpose of any life vest or PFD is that in case of unconsciousness,your head remains out of the water and in case you are faced down in the water,the vest will turn you over. During our TC training ,we tested various vest and floaters suits The PFD that automatically sets off,worked very very well and accomplished the needed functions during our trials.  Any vest that does not have a flotation material around the neck will not keep you head out of the water and makes you very susceptible to drowning  you need not worry about falling in cold water and your vest deploying,you will bob like a cork in water"
431787,solopaddler,2010-02-10 13:29:00,8605,Marc it's time to come clean. I think these pfd's are just fine. I'm trying to quit smoking and am in an argumentative mood.  
431801,trevy727,2010-02-10 14:11:00,351,"i'm with solo, i'd prefer to float when the canoe flips rather than pull a cord to float. i would also be worried about puncturing the pfd while portaging on a branch or with a hook while fishing. as i do most of my canoe fishing early in the spring, i don't really mind the bulkyness of the life vests. a little extra warmth. and mine make good padded seats in the warmer summer weather."
431879,motion,2010-02-10 18:14:00,403,Thanks Drifter. Just placed an order for a couple of these babies. I'm going to surprise Jr. with one when they arrive.
431885,bigfish1965,2010-02-10 18:28:00,3382,"I've been using one for years and anyone buying one..from any of the manufacturers... will be very happy. They are very comfortable. You will forget you are wearing it. I've gone into the grocery store after fishing and didnt realize I still had it on till I got a few strange glances.  These things are FAR superior to any PFD that you aren't wearing! The also come in handy for snowmobilers (mine adjusts big enough to go over a suit). For those that like their current suit and don't want to wear a floater suit, these would be a great option.  I'm not pushing these things for any reason other than I would love to see another successful and safe summer for our members. Fishing is the deadliest sport/pastime in the country. These guys aren't sponsors...though if they like they can contact us..lol  Remember that almost every single drowning that happens out there, the victim was wearing no PFD of any type. Okay....end of preaching!"
431886,cram,2010-02-10 18:32:00,1733,"Anyone received theirs yet, and seen what kind of brokerage charge UPS is tacking onto these babies?"
431896,Northern 66,2010-02-10 19:12:00,4,"Ha Guys, My wife just called me here at work. UPS delivered the vest at around 12:30 today. I will have a look at the added fees when i get home at 4:00 today and post the total amount. Thanks Ross O.K. Charged $25.30 brokage fee plus $7.87 GST plus $4.72 PST and $1.27 GST on Brokage fee . Nice looking vest. Thanks Ross"
431937,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-10 21:05:00,10439,  Was that for one vest?  Even with those ignorant fees it's still 1/2 price or less.
431952,moemoe,2010-02-10 21:17:00,352,"mine said 38.70 total, I hate ups but what can ya do"
431956,icedude,2010-02-10 21:21:00,459,  Nice unit Drifter-good value--for my purposes....  UPS Import Charges--$38.70  a Valentines Day present-the lady is going to love it  Thanks again dude   Cheers  ID1
430435,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-07 02:42:00,10439,Here's your chance to get an Inflatable PFD for a price too good to pass up. Now there's no excuse to not wear one!!!!  Life Vest Deal
430439,irishfield,2010-02-07 03:00:00,26272,"""USCG approved""... don't we need Canadian Coast Guard approved up here to pass inspection?? Wonder what the label has on it..."
430441,bigfish1965,2010-02-07 03:06:00,3382,"Yeah we need Canadian tags, but you can just keep a cheapo one in the boat and wear this one. That is an amazing price. They're $200 here....$54 is awesome!"
430442,irishfield,2010-02-07 03:08:00,26272,"I always have the CCG approved cheapies in the boat.. so that would cover it.. BUT a have heard they are going to mandate wearing a PFD very shortly.. and they would have to be Canadian approved if worn.  I already ordered 6 Rick ! lol (for basically the price of the one Mustang that I use in the airplane)  Interesting to note... if you go to Helly Hansen's website.. the US site shows this model.. the Canadian site doesn't and has no auto inflaters.. telling me they couldn't get CCG approval on them, but got USCG and sold to the bigger market. Either way...may actually get the ""canoe"" gang that frequents our place to wear these puppies!...while they sit on the other ones!"
430450,fish-miester,2010-02-07 03:25:00,864,wow awesome price. very tempting! i really wish they were approved tho !
430626,rocket09,2010-02-07 17:21:00,18,"Has anyone ordered from this company before, how are there shipping rates, and who do they use ups, usps, etc..? Tried there 1-800 number but only got voice mail. Thanks in advance chris."
430670,Rob,2010-02-07 18:58:00,467,"Can someone answer this then, if an american comes to Canada with their PFD's, do they get fined for not having a CCG approved PFD?   Rob C"
430674,Terry,2010-02-07 19:02:00,14456,they are ok on their own boat
430704,fishforfun,2010-02-07 19:39:00,105,"I have worn a manual inflatable for more than 30 yrs, USCG approved been checked by the OPP a half dozen times, never been asked to remove it to see if it had CCG certification. If your wearing it your making their job easier!"
430746,irishfield,2010-02-07 21:04:00,26272, You have the choice at check out of UPS.. USPS.. and other choices. If you want a quote for postage before commiting.. you can click that icon too. Considering 6 jackets cost what my one Mustang did a couple years back... I'm not too worried about the postage rate to insure my kids and friends have these on during their next canoeing adventure...
430759,kickingfrog,2010-02-07 21:23:00,8333,"    Ya, like Terry said. (Has that even been writen before?  )  If the jackets are legal in the state that the boat is from. Or country for that matter. Not many boats from Brazil up here in Canada I'm sure, however.  As with most things the officer's discretion comes into play. Generaly they are more consernd about safety rather than the letter of the law and trying to find out what is leagal in the state the boat is from, although the internet makes that a lot easier.  Something else that I wasn't aware of (partialy because I don't use a inflatible pfd) If you don't have your inflatible on, it doesn't count as a pfd.  Don't take my word for it, find-out for yourself. If you try to tell the officer that some guy on the interent said something was ok you deserve whatever happens to you."
430762,irishfield,2010-02-07 21:30:00,26272,"That is correct Rob.. you have to be wearing an inflatable for it to be ""legal""."
430766,HTHM,2010-02-07 21:36:00,4082,"That is why is such a good thing they are comfortable! I always have mine on. Well, at least when I'm in the boat....."
431059,moemoe,2010-02-08 17:52:00,352,"I called and ordered one, the sales rep said they were shipping an unbelievable amount of these to canada recently and was wondering why"
431111,Squid,2010-02-08 18:28:00,1656,"Great deal, I just ordered one for myself."
431114,irishfield,2010-02-08 18:34:00,26272,"TAKE NOTE !!!! They can only ship these Via UPS ground because of the compressed air cansisters.. Even though the website check out lets you select USPS Ground International.. they can not, nor will not ship them via the post office.  UPS is notorious for extravagant Brokerage fees... but considering the savings.. I told them to go ahead with my order.  They charged me $30, for UPS shipping, for 6 units. I'll see what the brokerage is when UPS calls..."
431115,danbouck,2010-02-08 18:36:00,4380," Usually about $40, I'm still buying 2 of them."
431117,irishfield,2010-02-08 18:37:00,26272, Yep... about $33 more than Fedx charges!
