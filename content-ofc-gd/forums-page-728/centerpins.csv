I have been researching all the different centerpins that are on the market and have come to the conclusion that my first pin will probably be a used one. Since the ones that have caught my eye are all in the 350 and up range and I dont really want to spend that kind of money.  So I was thinking I will keep my eye open for one that is gently used. My question is what should I be looking for when inspecting a used pin other than the normal cosmetics and the spinning of the reel is there any underlying issues I should be looking out for. Thanks in advance Fish."
