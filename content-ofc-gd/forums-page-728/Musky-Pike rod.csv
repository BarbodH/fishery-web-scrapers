432094,landry,2010-02-11 02:19:00,1005,"the 8'6"" pete maina rod is practically identical to my st croix slingblade but 1/3 the price. I own both. Buy a Maina 8'6"" if you can find it! the new rapala rods are way too short and behind the times. Most serious musky guys use 7'6"" and longer nowadays. The 7'6"" Rapala may be okay. I own an R-type bass baitcast rod and it is very nice for the dollars!!! (100$). This is an accurate and unbiased report as ""I"" am not spnsored by either of these brand - unfortunately. Landry"
432098,Aaron Shirley,2010-02-11 02:27:00,655," Actually, if you check out the link to the left and click on musky rods, you can see them.  The RType musky rods have traditional full cork handles, only one model has a split grip design  Aaron"
432099,basskicker09,2010-02-11 02:29:00,144,id go with the st. croix triumph i have a seven foot medium heavy brand new for sale for 75 bucks pm me if you want it
432100,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-11 02:32:00,3761, They look solid...one of those with a Shimano Cardiff or Abu Ambassador round baitcaster and I might even be able to catch a musky
432128,BillM,2010-02-11 03:40:00,17367,"  With the way you are going this winter, you might bring one up through the ice  :)"
432131,backbay,2010-02-11 03:49:00,773,"I'm glad to hear somebody else recommend Okuma. I have Solaris heavy, and has been terrific, but is a few years old, which I plan to augment with an EVX this year. You can get them for a little over $100"
432140,Raf,2010-02-11 04:50:00,3495," they werent muskie rods    give it a try, you will like it.  i first got wind of them listening to doug johnson rave about them being a great bang for the buck.  i used the 8'6"" XH all last year for big rubber, casting big jakes & big spinnerbaits.  worked well.   that store on ronsons dr has them for less than i've seen them go for on U$ sites."
432219,bigbuck,2010-02-11 15:20:00,2449,I have a couple of buddies with the newer Okuma EVX rods and they love them. A long medium heavy should do you fine.
432220,Jackie,2010-02-11 15:24:00,124,"Given the sale going on at Le Baron right now, your best value is probably the Fenwick Techna AV 6'6"" or 7' MH muskie trigger rod at $99.  See  http://www.lebaron.ca/pdffiles/web_spec/fe...chna_av_web.pdf  At regular price, the Techna AV is overpriced.  But at $99 it's a steal.  I would choose Techna AV over Compre.  It's about the same level as the St. Croix Avid.  The Markham store had a few left the last time I was there.  Probably a few more in the Mississauga store."
432229,solopaddler,2010-02-11 15:44:00,8605,  Now that's a great rod for the money. If I was in the market for one in that price range I'd be all over it.
432237,cram,2010-02-11 16:11:00,1733,"I have heard the tackle industries (www.tackleindustries.com?) rods are pretty good.  That guy's business seems to be around selling really high quality knock-offs for a great price (i like his bulldawg-style lures better than the real thing).   Not sure what his rods are based on, or who sell them."
432239,Syn,2010-02-11 16:19:00,519,"  That would be James IIRC. I really like his SOFT plastic lures, great quality for the price. I watched the video where he is jumping on the rod. The handle is cool because it unscrews. I wanted one, but a one piece 7'6"" footer or longer turned me off because I have to trasport it . Don't know how good it is in the long run compared to other rods, but his price is right. If you are lucky you can get a good deal on one on FleaBay Tacklebooty. He was on a Michigan fishing forum Late 2009 selling some for really good prices, below what he normally sells for."
432247,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-11 16:30:00,2690,"Just wanted to ""chime"" in here guys...thanks for the overwhelming response to my question...lots of good advice and lots of great offers on rods...looks like I will actually be getting two used rods for what I was looking to spend.  Can't wait to give them a shot...probably end up getting hooked like I did 25 years ago when I took up river steelheading!  I'm thinking that adrenaline surge hooking up with a musky must be amazing...one of the responses mentioned underpowering/overstressing the fish, and it is a very valid point...I don't want to overplay them, and ALL will be released...if I want a mount that bad it would be a replica.  I love eating fish, but, keeping a musky is not necessary, unless of course it is so badly hooked it would die anyway.  Thanks guys, hopefully some other musky novices are learning from this thread as well."
432325,cram,2010-02-11 20:00:00,1733," Prepare to get hooked.   Since becoming a ""musky fisherman"" i have consistently caught only one nice one a year (probably on 5-7 weekends per), so LOTS of fishless wknds fishing....yet still absolutely love it.   3/4 of my fishing is now for musky, despite rarely catching anything and having a truly excellent SMB and walleye fishery at my disposal."
432343,Weeds,2010-02-11 20:52:00,782,"Kind of funny because about 24 hours ago I was preaching about the value of buying used but I bought one of those Tackle Industries Rods. Got it about 2 monthes ago, the Mega Heavy 8 foot Rod, lure weights 8-36 ounces. I think once you add in shipping, taxes/ conversion  and duty it came to about 128 Canadian dollars. Looks solid although I'm a little dissapointed that the 2 piece handle does not line up perfectly. I can live with it providing the rod performs well otherwise. Sticking to my philosophy of buying quality stuff used I did pair it up with an Abu 7001i, which I got for 80 bucks like new.  Should suffice for Musky/Shark or Krakken fishing."
432470,landry,2010-02-12 01:19:00,1005,hey weeds - how do you like the TI rod. I have heard great things. Should go nice with the new reel:) Landry
431905,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-10 19:48:00,2690,"Alright guys/gals...in my quest for a musky (one of my goals for this year)...I need a beefier rod, medium/medium heavy...any suggestions for a decent one under $100...probably won't use it more than 10 times this year so don't want to break the bank on it.  Something of good quality for the money.  Thanks in advance."
431910,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-10 20:06:00,4399,You can`t go wrong with a Compre!
431918,BillM,2010-02-10 20:28:00,17367,"Yup, Shimano Compre for sure."
431922,solopaddler,2010-02-10 20:37:00,8605,I had 3 Compre rods break last year for no apparant reason.
431923,Raf,2010-02-10 20:41:00,3495,"you compre fanboys make me giggle.  besides, they are above $100.  okuma has a line of musky rods in your price range - evx series.  st. croix's triumph line will be right around $100 or a tad less too.  says the st. croix fanboy."
431926,fishindude,2010-02-10 20:46:00,220,"Was just looking into the Pete Maina Signature Series today from BPS, any thoughts on them? They seem to be in your price range too."
431928,Raf,2010-02-10 20:51:00,3495,"i'd recommend against the bps rods.  they are heavy (in weight) and IMO inferior to the okumas, st. croix triumph which are at the same price point.  your mileage may vary."
431929,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-10 20:52:00,4399,  The last 3 Compre`s I purchased were under 100 dollars.
431931,Syn,2010-02-10 20:59:00,519,"Medium heavy for pike/musky??? I think you better make sure by taking your reel with you to the store and mounting it to the rod and checking for rod flex with the line threaded through. I use a medium heavy IM7 Daiwa 7' for mostly smaller pike 30"" and big bass and there is PLENTY of rod flex when the pike suddenly freaks out when it gets near the boat, probably a bit too much flex. Had that rod for about 5 years now, serving me well, but I use a heavy rod for lures over 1.5 oz. Medium heavy is the sweet spot for the majority of my fishing, but heavy rod is better for bigger pike 35+"".  Also have you given some thought to what weight lures you are going to throw. A 1oz is fine with most medium heavies, but if you are going for bigger pike/muskie with big lures weighting 1.5oz to 5oz I think you are going to wreck your arm and maybe the rod. If you are hoping to catch bigger pike and muskies 35+"" I suggest you check heavy rods that can handle bigger lures and bigger fish.  I like the long rod handle for pike so I can butt it against my stomach when fish fighting, takes all the stress away from my arms. Personal preference I guess.  Mind you, you can catch a muskie using a barbie kids rod, but I can't imagine how long that took to fight.  I stopped looking for brand name as much as looking for features for the price and warranty. If you can find a IM7 or better with a great reel seat and fuji or better guides that sounds like a good deal for $80 and taxes. Line is very important too. Found power pro to be great for pike, but I use a fluorocarbon leader 80+lb too. Pike can cut through power pro quickly I have learned! I heard the recoil guides make a lot of noise with braided line so I'm not sure if those are the better option than sic guides.   btw I looked up the compre since we seem to have a lot of fans here, $128+taxes at Lebarons so it might be out of you budget if you can't find it cheaper."
431935,BillM,2010-02-10 21:03:00,17367,"  Shut up my Shimano is better then your St.Croix!!!!!  Don't argue with me!!!!!!!!!!!!  I dunno why it's better!!!  (ok I do, it's because I bought one) but still... mines better!!!  "
431958,ChrisK,2010-02-10 21:37:00,2772,St Croix for sure....I got poles that are twenty years old and needed nothing more than a new eyelet here and there. Tuff as nails for the price no word of a lie....  Good Luck !
431966,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-10 21:58:00,2690,"Thanks for an extremely comprehensive reply...the reason I was leaning toward medium heavy is that I wasn't anticipating throwing lures over 1 ounce, but having seen enough muskies and larger pike caught on tv (as well as some pike I have landed myself) they do like to put on that explosion close to the boat...I looked up the compres as well and found the prices about the same, but, solopaddler's reply concerns me...I have never had three rods break on me in my life, be it salmon, steelhead or warm water fish.  Thanks to everyone else who has replied so far as well."

Drop me a pm if ya like.  Meely"
431991,irishfield,2010-02-10 22:58:00,26272,  I have a custom Spiel Loomis that stood up to a bridge at 30 MPH !!  I like it the most.. but expensive.. as well as my St. Croix's.. but of course they were about $149 if I remember right...  The BPS Pete Maina works well as a trolling rod... or as a guest rod in the boat.
432019,cram,2010-02-11 00:03:00,1733,"I fished with a heavy berkley lightning rod for my first years of musky fishing and it was fine (great for standard musky baits...a little light for mag bulldawgs atc).  You needn't go overboard with rods for musky....you're not fishing for walleye, so sensitivity and finesse isn't an issue (i laugh when i read ads for musky rods describing sensitivity).  Get something that looks well made, durable, and has solid guides.   Weight can be an issue if you plan on casting all day for multiple days....otherwise, don't sweat it.  Some advice... - if you plan on fishing with spinnerbaits and bucktails, consider a longer rod (easier to cast further, and do figure 8's at boatside) - if you plan on fishing with jerk baits (suicks etc), a shorter stiffer rod  (easier to impart the action) - for crankbaits and plugs it matters less...    And, for the casual fisherman, either rod will be fine for all applications."
432020,Andy,2010-02-11 00:03:00,330,"Would you be interested in a used rod? I have a two piece Fenwick Canadian Methods musky trigger rod, excellent shape, rated 1-4 oz, medium-heavy, 6'6"", works good with smaller bucktails, cranks, etc. New at Lebarons for $62.00. I work in Stratford, I see your from Woodstock. Come to Stratford and it's yours for $30.00. Andy"
432023,bare foot wader,2010-02-11 00:12:00,1354,"Andy is offering a decent rod at a very fair price...  also, I think daiwa makes some cheaper musky rods for around 50-under100 bucks.  I was also looking a rapala musky rod that was pretty nice for 60 bucks.  IMO I'd focus on finding a good reel over the rod, retrieving musky baits all day with a bass baitcaster is no fun....as previously stated you don't need a fancy rod, find the cheapest rod that is strong enough to handle a musky and then spend the rest of your budget on a good reel and spoolin up with 80 or 100lb braid....abu's are good reels and lots around for cheap, last forever"
432034,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-02-11 00:36:00,158,"Raf is the man, he knows his stuff.  I second his opinion.  I have 4 okuma rods and they are great.  I have been a shimano guy my whole life, but recently started buying St. Croix, Fenwick, Berkley, All Star and a few others.  St. Croix and Shimano are sweet rods, but over priced.  Its seems to me that shimano seems to underrate teh line and lure weight rating on the Compre rods.  The Okuma Musky series will run you up to 150, but lifetime warrenty for way less than St. Croix.   IM9 graphite and the same fuji guides and reel seats as everyone else.  I see you want to throw lighter baits, but if you get into muskie fishing seriously that will quickly change.  Big baits are the way to go.  Sure small baits catch big fish, but you will be busy hooking snot rockets and smaller muskie.  Big baits = big fish.  Of course you will still hook the odd smaller fish, but i recommend going a bit heavier.  I mean if you want  to throw smaller baits, a heavy flipping stick will get you by or an inshore saltwater rod, there are tons of ways you can save money by buying something that isn't muskie specific.  Once you get into species specific rods, companies tend to up the prices.  Also you have to factor in the fish you are targeting, even if you are throwing lighter baits, you want a heavy enough rod to run heavy line so you can get the fish in quick.  Taking forever to land a muskie on lighter tackle is a big no no with muskie.  The longer you fight them the more harm you do to them.  With stout line and tackle you can put the pressure on and land them in good time.  Anyway if you do decide to go heavier I have an Okuma EVx Musky Rod forsale in the classified section."
432038,Aaron Shirley,2010-02-11 00:45:00,655,"The new Rapala RType Musky rod series are incredible (new this year).  They are as good as the St.Croix Avid musky rods in my opinion, very light and sensitive, and extremely strong.  They are really nice looking rods as well, and priced in your price range: Rapala RType Rods  Just click on the ""new"" button on the left side and choose Musky Rods.  I put these rods in the hand of some musky nuts I know, and they were shocked at how nice these rods are.. heck, I'm still shocked!  The more traditional Rapala XLT musky rods are also really nice: Rapala XLT Rods  You can't go wrong with the St.Croix Premier, Avid or Tournament rods either.  Aaron"
432044,Guest buick14,2010-02-11 01:03:00,0,"Shimano Teramar series if you can find one....a little more than your budget but worth it fresh/saltwater rods MH will do for sure tc4 construction comparable to compre, but built for harsher conditions...  I put my LIFE ON IT it'll take everything you throw at it and you wont destroy it (guides, blank, reel seat etc.)...I'm aware of how bold of a statement that is...  everything stated prior is a quality proven rod (except r type.. its to new, not saying it isnt good though)"
432046,Weeds,2010-02-11 01:07:00,782,"Musky opener is monthes off. If you keep your eyes open you should have no problem scoring a higher end Musky rod (be it St. Croix, Compre, Fig Rig, whatever) for a 100 bucks if you keep your eyes on the classified sections, hear and kijiji. I just sold two St. Croixs for a 100 bucks each about 3 monthes back. Even if you have to spend a little more, say 120, you can use it for 2 years then sell it for close to a 100. So buy something good, but buy it used!"
432062,solopaddler,2010-02-11 01:35:00,8605, I guess it's the in thing these days. I'm not a fan of the zero foregrip split grip handles. Especially when they're made with foam and not cork.  The XLT rods are more my style. Too bad their higher end rods arn't built the same way.
432069,Syn,2010-02-11 01:44:00,519, Foam needs to die a slow painful death   . Cork has a much better feeling or better yet I found using a thin tennis grip wrap is so comfortable after 10 hours of casting.
