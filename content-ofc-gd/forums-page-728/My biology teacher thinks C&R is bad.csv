Fish don't have the mental capacity to know fear or relate to it like humans or more advanced animals. Her position on C&R is her opinion not backed up by scientific study. Do a search for scientific studies on the subject and read more. I believe one study was done by a professor at the UIniversity of Wyoming in the states. You should be able to find considerable information on the subject. Rember that studies financed by special interests tend to be skewed towardsw the beliefs of the financier.

I forget). - they are incapable of pain and emotions the way we experience them.  Most of their reactions are instinctive.  That's all you need to know.

If my kids weren't allowed to be exposed to Christianity during their public school years I sure wouldn't have wanted to hear that the teachers were preaching personal lifestyle beliefs that differed from what was taught in our home.

432967,cram,2010-02-13 21:02:00,1733," Some stuff to think about.... - do you know that the teacher was standing at the front of the class ""teaching"" this, vs. stating a personal opinion to a student in a side discussion?  Doesn't make it right, but there's a big difference. - if she had said that bull fighting is cruel....would it be as controversial? - ""teachers"" are one of those disciplines where they all get lumped together based on the wrongs of a few.  Its funny how many on this site villified anyone who made comments about autoworkers because of a few people (just because some of us take advantage of the union Bull, don't paint us all with the same brush!!)...yet we do it to teachers.

432968,JohnF,2010-02-13 21:14:00,3494," Does it matter where a teacher tries to impose personal biases on their students? Presumably they still have a certain amount of influence, even out of school.  As long as we're what-iffing - what if the teacher who criticized bullfighting was teaching in Seville?

432593,GoneFishin,2010-02-12 06:29:00,349,She's probably not looking at it from a personal perspective. A percentage of your fish are most likely harmed from either the hook or the fight/handling. But most fishermen can use there judgment and keep a harmed fish instead of wasting it.

I will add this I think it was the nature of things or another show and they were trying to determine whether fish feel pain and I think the conclusion was they didn't know yet but that it was unlikely they did. They certainly feel something and do feel stress but it is thought that the brain of fish lacks the complexity of mammals to turn stress/pain into what we know as a pain to be a much more emotional and complex response or something along those lines.  Anyways it leaves the possibility that fish feel pain and that C & R could be considered cruel if that was ever proven. However many anglers go above and beyond to put the least amount of stress on fish with C & R including barbless hooks, etc."

432688,Twocoda,2010-02-12 17:33:00,4130,almost makes you wonder how we as mammals can debate over the complexity of a fishes brain and the relativity of it to register pain when we cant even understand our own brains....but ....if you set a hook...is there a reaction?? yes the fish runs...if you open the bail and ease off the pressure does the fish still run? not normally....that to me sounds like an indication of some level of pain.....when a lamprey connects to a fish does it not flight to get it off????another indication of pain....lets say a human gets his ear pierced....initial piercing is somewhat discomforting but we feel it and it subsides ...now lets tie a rope to the earing and pull on it ...do ya think its going to hurt continuously while the pressure is on?... i think so ....based on simple physics of action and reaction....do they cry when i catch their mate????who knows ....cant see tears under the water...lol...  i would hope a teacher would base his or her perception based on actual facts....albeit right or wrong at the time...but based on something to support their beliefs  catch and release ...to each is their own ....its a definite that its favorable so the fish can live to feel pain again  isnt stress a form of a feeling ???? if they can feel stress ...why wouldnt they feel pain?

As adults we are well equipped to know the difference between fact and fiction and a half-truth (well most of the time anyway). The job of every teacher is/was always to teach students how to learn the ciriculumn. Personal bias and opinions have NO place in the classroom. Personal beliefs and personal moral values should never be discussed in the classroom. The key word here is ""Personal"".  My advice to this teacher is simple, if she wants to voice her opinion then voice it in any public forum she wants, even this one, but leave the kids out of it.   muddler"
432703,JohnF,2010-02-12 18:30:00,3494," All living creatures have a fight or flight reaction. In most fish there isn't much to fight with so it's a more basic flight thing I guess.  The stress we hear about in played fish is a physical trauma, not an emotional one. It's different to the stress usually experienced by higher life forms like us humans. I doubt fish have the brain capacity to experience much in the way of emotion. They basically only know to breed when it's time, guard the eggs in their time, eat, and run from a threat. Kids cartoons have given us a distorted sense of what emotions and awareness animals are capable of. It's doubtful in the real world Bambi would have really grieved over his mom much. In fact he probably would have sniffed around a bit and then got on with the business of trying to survive. He'd the food and warmth.  JF"
432706,Mykester,2010-02-12 18:42:00,241," They don't. The article that was linked here (the Gord Ellis one) states that ""the conscious experience of pain or suffering is due to activity in the cortex of the brain. That activity is located in a specialized kind of cortex called the neo-cortex, which is very large in humans. Fish don't possess a neo-cortex. They literally don't have the brain system to feel pain or other emotions like fear."""

432720,Oggie,2010-02-12 19:25:00,588,Well I'll give the other side of the coin. I'm a retired biology teacher who often taught environmental science and in that course there was a unit on fisheries and wildlife managament. The topic of catch and release was often discussed with the pros and cons. The kids knew I would take a fish when I choose too. Hell I brought a big rainbow in for a class dissection (beats those damn pickled perch).  It's good to have a descenting voice to provoke thought and discussion (not that it should be the teacher who descents). The kids know you're point of view even if you don't come out and say it. They're pretty persceptive by grade 12. What the teacher said is no big deal unless she is presenting it as the only side to the issue and won't allow discussion.  BTW that view of C&R is really common in teachers as you move from more rural to more urban. Same with anti-hunting!  I hear there bring environmental science back to the curriculum. Let's hope they get teacher's who see things from a conservation point of view not preservation. DanO.

I talk about my love for fishing all the time to kids at school.  I know lots of students don't like it but I do and I tell them it is my opinion.   I don't talk about torturing fish and I rarely talk about eating them.  Mostly I just talk about the fact that I like fishing.  I wore a WFN t-shirt to school under my zippered hoodie and made sure it was unzipped enough to see the orange WFN crest.  I then explained that WFN (in my opinion) was the best network on TV.  Anyone who disagreed lost 5% off their final mark.  No one disaggreed   J/K by the way about the students losing 5% because they didn't agree with me.  Don't want to get anyone's panties in a knot here.  Oh, by the way I teach in an area where kids drive more sleds to school than they do cars and they often take a week off school to go hunting so my opinion and love for fishing is shared by many."

432842,Dutchy,2010-02-13 04:41:00,416," That mad me laugh. But there is evidence that some animals do ""grieve"". Thats a whole other story though. Humans are very arrogant about what animals do and don't feel, maybe it makes us feel better about the way we treat them. The problem is on the one had we say don't assign human traits to animals, but then we try to judge an animals behaviour based on our behaviour. Makes no sense.  Regarding the fish, do they feel pain, I don't know. They sure as hell are going to feel the pressure though which I am sure is not real comfortable.  Not sure why some people are getting so bent out of shape on this. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, even teachers."

432875,dave524,2010-02-13 12:56:00,4508,"I think most are missing the point here, this movement to ban C&R fishing is not based on whether the fish feels pain or whether C&R is better for the population of the species. They know they will lose the argument on these  grounds, I dare say most animal right groups have more PR spin doctors on staff than trained biologists. Their argument is based solely on whether it is morally and ethically right for humans to reduce an animal to basically a plaything for our enjoyment or to stroke our egos."
432878,Terry,2010-02-13 13:08:00,14456,and that is why I think every type of fish may need a slot size reg. that way C&R is mandatory and not just a  morally and ethically right for humans to reduce an animal to basically a plaything for our enjoyment or to stroke our egos.

I was thinking panfish, but these are primarily eaten, and trout, however flyfishermen tend to use barbless hooks, and stocked trout are primarily stocked in ponds to be eaten.  *Rambled about how C&R is cruel but then I mentioned how fishing was a sport and then she sort of went quiet.  *Then mentioned how these wounds left imprinted by the hooks could lead to infection. While it is a fair point, I don't believe killing every single fish you catch just because a few may become infected is justified.

She is entitled to her opinion and I don't think we should bash her so badly.  How is this Kid going to believe a word she says now?  Its good to ask questions and its good to debate, but if we are going to win over the hearts and minds of non-fishers we better be a little more tactful."
432575,bigfish1965,2010-02-12 04:46:00,3382," If the teacher is teaching science, she should not be offering up any type of opinion not based in fact. If she's like to have some discourse, doing it with high school kids is not the right forum. If she has a defensible hypothesis, then offer it and encourage kids to research for debate. But tossing something like that out is rather irresponsible given the audience. She should not be pushing any agenda."
432578,cram,2010-02-12 04:52:00,1733,What if a teacher in Switzerland suggested that Catch and Release is a good idea?   Would he/she be villified the way this one is here?
432579,hammercarp,2010-02-12 04:53:00,964,"Once again. As a teacher, a professional, she should be fully cognizant of the consequences of what she is saying to her students."
432581,hammercarp,2010-02-12 04:56:00,964,I have an idea Mikester. Invite her to the forum and let her defend her views here.
432584,BillM,2010-02-12 04:59:00,17367," Wow, that seems like a fair fight."
432585,crappieperchhunter,2010-02-12 05:00:00,2582, Thx Tony that registered a good chuckle here.
432592,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-02-12 05:49:00,158,"I agree with you guys whole heartedly, a teacher should not be throwing their ""opinion"" around.  But bashing won't solve anything.  One of the best lines i ever heard from a Prof that I respect very much.  ""Science takes part, its doesn't take sides.""  Interesting enough that study that P3TA and other animal rights groups are clinging to, does just that, it takes a side in argement.  I see it all the time.  I think the kid was looking for ammo to take back, not our ""opinion"" of the teacher."
432476,Mykester,2010-02-12 01:27:00,241,She says you're torturing the fish and it's better to eat it than throw it back. Discuss.
432477,timmeh,2010-02-12 01:29:00,609, Most ridiculous thing I've heard in a while.
432478,danbouck,2010-02-12 01:29:00,4380,this should be a good one
432480,backbay,2010-02-12 01:31:00,773,"I don't think your teacher likes fishing, or fish, for that matter."
432481,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-12 01:32:00,0,she's entitled to her moronic opinion!
432482,danc,2010-02-12 01:33:00,4677,"If I were a fish, I'd rather be released than fried. Ask her what her choice would be if she were a fish?"
432484,Roy,2010-02-12 01:36:00,13728,"Don't blame her, Mykester. Some people are not cut out to do what they do for a living.  Have you considered that? Perhaps she couldn't find work in her field...as a cow."
432485,irishfield,2010-02-12 01:40:00,26272,I didn't know that Carrie Underwood was a teacher....
432486,Rizzo,2010-02-12 01:41:00,4754,"I'm not trying to be funny here, but A LOT OF TEACHERS are very very strange people...discuss"
432487,BillM,2010-02-12 01:42:00,17367, Now that's funny!!!   How the hell did she get a job teaching? lol
432488,Rizzo,2010-02-12 01:44:00,4754,"would you prefer 3 minutes of torture once a year or to be killed? Sign me up for the torture (especially considering we don't even know for a fact it hurts the fish - my guess would be it doesn't or they could never eat anything sharp ie perch, crayfish etc)"
432489,gdelongchamp,2010-02-12 01:47:00,199,Introduce her to this thread.
432492,FISHINGNUT,2010-02-12 01:50:00,253,"Whats that old expression ? THOSE WHO CAN DO THOSE WHO CANT ,  TEACH"
432493,gdelongchamp,2010-02-12 01:51:00,199,"Is she married? Ask her if she married the first boyfriend she ever had or did she ""release him"" ?"
432495,Terry,2010-02-12 01:52:00,14456,"there are many stupid , ill informed teachers"
432496,bare foot wader,2010-02-12 01:53:00,1354,"fish have very few nerve endings in their mouth....being hooked doesn't actually cause them a lot, if any pain....it's how they are played and handled that induces stress (ie being dropped in boat, held out of water for too long, lactid acid buildup from being fought too long/improperly, poor water quality, etc, etc)....assuming a fish is handled with proper catch and release methods then the fish has a very strong possibility of survival...used to know the % numbers but not anymore  there is of course some mortality with C&R but in the grand scheme of things there are much larger and devastating threats to our fisheries.  did this teacher actually say why she feels that way? did she provide any sort of qualified information, or just running her opinion?"
432497,smitter,2010-02-12 01:56:00,106,Your Biology teacher is an idiot and she should stick to teaching the curriculum and keep her opinions to herself.
432504,irishfield,2010-02-12 02:08:00,26272,Just ask her if some creep came along and grabbed her...threw her in a van.. tied her up and gagged her.. would she rather be killed and eaten.. or 2 minutes after the abduction released to run home?
432506,Guest gbfisher,2010-02-12 02:12:00,0,"Tell her fish eat spiny, prickly things all day long and if it hurt them they'd all starve! Then ask her where she got her degree... Then tell her Pam has more up top.....   She does have a point though. Putting the onus on fisherman to practice C&R is not a way to conserve a fishery. I think she is confused with her facts is all...lol"
432507,hammercarp,2010-02-12 02:12:00,964,"I had a teacher tell me that communism was okay, Stalin and Mao just got a lot of bad press. There is no doubt that catching a fish on a hook and line, is stressful, frightening and bewilding for a fish. But I don't think their tiny brains have the capacity to retain that memory for very long. Although that may get used to it. Guys will tell you that fish that are routinely caught tend not to fight too hard. Like the trout up in Fergus or carp in English ponds."
432508,buckster,2010-02-12 02:16:00,530,  I think it would be a hard choice for her.  She probably wouldn't wanna die but eaten hmmmmmm
432510,Syn,2010-02-12 02:21:00,519," Tell her the amount of ""torture"" that fishermen inflict on a fish when catching it  is nothing compared to the magnitude of emotional ""torture"" women inflict on men during dating or even during marriage.   :lol:"
432518,dave524,2010-02-12 02:44:00,4508,"This idea is not to be taken lightly, Switzerland banned catch and release fishing recently, surprised it didn't make the headlines in this forum.  http://fishing.about.com/od/fishingontheba...Swiss_Catch.htm"
432523,oxcowboy,2010-02-12 02:54:00,544, that was the first thing that popped into my mind as well believe it or not. lol  jason
432524,Syn,2010-02-12 02:55:00,519," Just because someone passes a law does not make it right or smart. I don't expect a law that makes  'intent' illegal to catch on in the rest of Europe or the world. This law may not even last a year especially if they are killing every fish they catch.    From the same article:  “And demanding that people kill the fish they catch gives no thought to the conservation benefits from releasing them.""  Angling Codes of Conduct with regards to proper handling and releases can be found for practically any fish species caught by anglers in Switzerland and the rest of the world. The new Swiss law makes it obligatory for anglers to take lessons before being granted a fishing license. So there is absolutely no need for an outright ban on the release of fish in Switzerland.”  EFTTA acting president, Pierangelo Zanetta, said: ""EFTTA does not believe that forcing anglers to kill their catches is either good for nature or for recreational sport fishing - which makes a significant financial contribution to the EU economy.  “Making the killing of fish obligatory will simply reduce fish population and, at the same time, run the risk of having a negative impact on sport fishing.""  ""Anglers and the sport of angling invest time and money to improve water quality and create larger and healthier fish populations. We believe is it far better for the fish if the fisherman decides, according to the situation, whether to keep and eat the fish or to release it."""
