They call snow days from school with even an inkling of snow on the ground......I thought rednecks were a tough bunch . The blizzard of 77 would have shut them down for about a year."

Art,there is a can of diesal in my garage for the tractor.Please check my phone messages to see if Les wants to borrow the tractor.The internet can be spotty here but you can email me if there are any problem. How are my dogs? Hosers,I think that if the US wants to retaliate for your dumping this snow on us it should be over quick.I have never seen so many Canadians as I have here in Costa Rica.Your country must be empty.

430410,douG,2010-02-07 01:38:00,2693,"Art, please take some pictures.  And your brother is saying egzactly what I would say in the same situation.  It's still not a very nice thing to do tho.  Heh heh heh."
430414,Greencoachdog,2010-02-07 01:45:00,8163, Art has a Huge blower!!!    I'm sure of that too!!!    Where have I heard that before?

Both fixed the 3rd one needs a new blower motor but Joe has 2 furnaces so it will survive. I can say that this really messed up the area pretty badly with the main roads still snow packed with less than 60 cars an hours or about 5% of the normal traffic. Next year I think I will winter inn Canada so I don't has so much snow to deal with....   Art"

431024,ketchenany,2010-02-08 16:46:00,3229,"  And they need it! Geography wise. I was in Florida yesterday morning and the snow thing came up . . . and a gentleman asked me where we were from and told him ONTARIO CANADA . . . his answers ""I guess you'll be home before us"" (flight leaving at the same time) and then I asked him where he was from and he told me Arkansas . . . ? I almost broke up!  No snow in my drive way!"
431157,Rich Clemens,2010-02-08 20:58:00,3131,"Yeah - we need it alright.   Another one is coming our way tomorrow and into Wednesday from what I hear.        We're running out of places to put it.   And, hats off to our borough employees and their plowing abilitities.  The street in front of my house is now only one lane and there is a good 8+ feet of snow from the curb out to where they actually plowed.   Couple that with several feet unplowed on the other side.  Sue glad we have a helpful neighbor with the equipment to finish up the boro's job in front of my house."

Forecast we heard this morning was for up to another foot of snow.  Of course, that's what they were predicting for the week-end storm, and we doubled that one.  Fire up the tractor again Art."

Earlier in the week they were calling for 1-3 inches.... but they haven't said anything lately. The ground is going to be good and frozen with an over night low of 27*F, so what ever falls is going to stick.  I blame Canada for this!  ... y'all keep that dad-burned cold air to yourselves now, ya heah?  Y'all is messing up my spring Speckled Perch fishin'!!!"

It seems it would be rain except for Canadas generous donation of the cold air.... So in the same spirit that you gave the cold air to us. We ( The Southern Contingency) Have officially decided to not send any Warm air up North till you stop your unwanted cold air attack...

429811,aplumma,2010-02-05 14:27:00,6896,Well the good news is we have a decent sized tractor with a bucket and blade so I will survive fine. The bad news is Daplumma and Bec's with Mom and Pops are all sitting on the beach in Costa Rica laughing at me I am sure. I'm off to get some extra fuel for the tractor before it starts that nasty white stuff falling from the sky.   Art

Went ahead and removed the snow from our 2-car garage, as I'm assuming there was a tremendous amount of weight up there.  Now - If I can even move tomorrow, it will be a wonder.   My mother also has very accommodating neighbors, or I'd be up there trying to get her dug out.    OK - Enough of winter already.  South of us, had even more.  Maybe Art will pop in and tell us how much he got down there."

The blade does nothing so it is scoop a bucket and then turn to the side and dump....repeat a gazillion times. The monotony breaker is get the tractor unstuck. This is a big tractor too.  If I find out Canada ""attacked"" us on purpose I'm comin up there in June and drowned all of your muskies at Lak Air   Art"
