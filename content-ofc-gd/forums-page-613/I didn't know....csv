519354,rbaquial,2010-11-12 03:46:00,968,".....But according to this YouTube video... there are places near TORONTO that have these fish?! .... My question is WHERE?!  I've fished for these guys before out in Sarnia, Ontario and they were a freakin' RIOT!! And I can't even begin to think of places that would support their habitat?!    <object width=""480"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63wyxqXde7g?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63wyxqXde7g?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63wyxqXde7g?fs=1&hl=en_US"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""480"" height=""385""></embed></object>    NOTE: Not looking for any secret places...Just sayin'..."
519356,John Bacon,2010-11-12 04:05:00,3277,"They were referring to Toronto, Kansas in the video.  Having said that, they are in Lake Ontario so any of the rivers in Toronto may get a run of white bass... worth a try."
519358,Twocoda,2010-11-12 04:07:00,4130,i may be wrong ....but i think white bass are what you get in a filet-o-fish at McRonnies...lake Erie use to have an abundance of them down the leamington way ...
519359,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-11-12 04:41:00,1107,Erie still has a tonne of them lots in my home river in the spring to I catch them while steelheading.
519361,OhioFisherman,2010-11-12 06:15:00,6623,"White bass spawn in the spring, the Sandusky river on this side of Lake Erie used to get a good run of them. I think it was shortly after the spring Walleye run. Going back to when I was a kid I remember one of dad`s fishing buddies stopping by the house with a cooler full of them that were all 14-18 inches. Never saw them that big again in quantity."
519371,Muskieman,2010-11-12 12:12:00,2472,We have a massive run here every spring....Lake Nipissing Silvers come up the Sturgeon River... from mid May to the first week of June.  Fun stuff I tells ya.  Randy
