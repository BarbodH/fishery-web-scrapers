I figured if i could get clamping rod holders with swivelling heads or w.e i could mount one on each of the wodden seats - towards the side (after i mount a swivelling chair in the middle), or i could mount one rod holder to the motor mount for trolling purposes.  What do i need to get and from where ? has anyone does this before with an inflatable boat. I dunno, any information and help regarding this would be appreciated.  Thanks in ADVANCE folks  Afraz"
