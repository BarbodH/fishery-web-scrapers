518570,Tarzan's Jane,2010-11-09 12:05:00,1183," I feel terrible for upsetting you.  Please allow me to explain. My first few words were...There really are hunters on this site I was complimenting the OP and at the same time making reference to another member who has been at it and at it without success....I like this member and did not want to *out* him....I was teasing him in an obscure way. Hence the reason for this...  which was meant to show that I am a   for making that comparison. I hope you are following me up to this point....if not, then I invite you to send me a PM and I will be glad to clarify it more for you. Next I went on to say....Such a beautiful animal I truly believe that and always will. Next I put a *sigh*....because I am happy for the hunter, sad for the hunted. Next I put *your son looks like you* because I think he does. And Finally I put *congrats* ... because I really meant it.  Now you go about having a great day and look for the good in people."
518577,Billy Bob,2010-11-09 12:30:00,5865,NICE.....you have now been selected honorary member of the Red Neck Club...  :worthy:  There are many chapters in the USA and I'm sure there are some in the Great White North.
518644,rickster,2010-11-09 16:37:00,495, Thx Skud that is the buck I had the most pics of this fall. Here is one of them. Notice the curved brow tines.    I have a couple cams up still but haven't checked them in a while I have a buddy coming from Thunder Bay next week so I will go out with him in hopes of getting a nice one.
518662,capt bruce,2010-11-09 17:11:00,820,"Dont ya love it when A plan works out . Great buck , a really nice mature Ont buck , nice work bro .

519015,Twocoda,2010-11-11 00:00:00,4130,Nice rack!!! (last time i said that i got slapped )  now you have more time for fishing ...good on ya for your success
519045,TJQ,2010-11-11 01:27:00,7806,Very nice... (insert jealousy here...)
519093,Leecher,2010-11-11 04:28:00,7832,Awesome buck rickster Got to love it when the big boys come out to play in close range!!! Congrats and thanks for sharing Leechman
517811,rickster,2010-11-05 18:53:00,495,I had to work on the morning of the 30th (opening morning) so I couldn't make it to the stand til about four oclock  after the sons hockey practice. Wasn't long til I had about nine does and fawns in the field. Just at sunset a decent 10 point came out and began checking out the females. Fifteen minutes go by and the ten point looks behind him and his tail goes down. I'm thinking whatever is coming has kicked this guys butt once before. He walked out about eighty yards away and just stood looking out over the field. With only ten minutes left of legal shooting time left I cranked up the power on my scope and took the shot. It looked like a good shot so I hurried down to look for blood but it was getting dark fast so I went back to my truck for a flashlight and began searching. After about ten minutes of searching I finally found a couple of drops but didn't feel real good because of the small amount of blood. With temps dropping below zero that night I decided to leave him til morning. Found him the next day about twenty yards from where I found the drops of blood laying stone dead in the swamp grass. This has to be my shortest hunting season ever. Any way here are a few pics of me and my son with the deer before we tagged and field dressed him.           and this is my favorite pic quite the smile on my sons face    Now to start thinking of ice fishing with those tasty deer sausages
517815,misfish,2010-11-05 19:00:00,29133,I know yer not trying to rub it in Rick.  Great buck and thanks for the pics.My sons had and have no interest.Shame really.   Good shooting.

517825,Harrison,2010-11-05 19:37:00,2202," I think he is just showing you what a real buck looks like for reference incase you come across another fallen tree root system.  Cause ya know, it's been a while...  Beauty buck Rick."
517832,Oggie,2010-11-05 20:07:00,588,Good things happen to dad's who take their kids to hockey practices! It's a rule somewhere!  Dan O.

518223,crappieperchhunter,2010-11-07 18:56:00,2582,"  I'm not a hunter...and that's still FUNNY  Sorry Brian. But I did get a good chuckle out of that.  Phil didn't your folks teach you anything about provoking newfies with guns  BTW Rickster thanx for sharing your pics, congrats. Looks like you got a future hunting partner for sure."
518230,Sinker,2010-11-07 20:20:00,8692,Good stuff Rick!! He's a beauty!!  S.

518385,AzuluSpookd,2010-11-08 15:17:00,348,Why would you bother posting on this thread? 
518386,Headhunter,2010-11-08 15:24:00,5703,Nice Buck! Looks like he's winking at us in the pic... I guess that means he knows he's about to become Pepperettes! HH
518416,Motorhead,2010-11-08 17:45:00,163,Nice Buck....
518433,Harrison,2010-11-08 18:53:00,2202," Oh, me brudder knows wheres I am coming from, all in fun.  Although, I did spent 3 weeks in Newfie where one guy did not get where I was coming from.  He was either calling me a toonie or asking for one, or so I thought. As I pulled one out to give him, he blew his lid. He was actually calling me a ""townie"".  That was a fun night.  Again, nice buck Rick.  My freezer is still void of venison."
518437,TC1OZ,2010-11-08 19:19:00,987,"Awesome pics! Good stuff!  By the looks of the pics you'd think your son shot it, his smile says it all!"
518531,Skud,2010-11-09 01:30:00,739,Nice brute.  Congrats.  It doesn't seem to resemble the bucks from your trail cam pics. I guess there are few more big boys running around out there.  Do you still have your camera setup?
518566,outllaw,2010-11-09 11:20:00,1232,great hunt and great memories. your son says it with his smiles. harvesting and enjoying the meat is another bonus.
