518647,Swan_Dive,2010-11-09 16:45:00,46,I was wondering if any of you guys could help me find a place in Barrie to get my auger blades sharpened.  Can you sharpen them yourself or do you need a machine?  Thanks for the help  Swany
518654,misfish,2010-11-09 16:56:00,29133,I dont of anyone here.I would suggest buying replacements.
518664,Governator,2010-11-09 17:14:00,879,"Would be interested in the same thing, is it easier to just buy replacements?"
518665,DRIFTER_016,2010-11-09 17:15:00,10439,You could buy one of These and do it yourself.  Or buy a new set or use fish307's blade exchange.
518674,irishfield,2010-11-09 17:38:00,26272, You know Dave.. the number of times this gets asked that would pay for itself in no time...
518683,GBW,2010-11-09 18:16:00,8460,"step 1, buy a second set of blades. step 2, buy a ""skate stone"". step 3, use the skate stone on old blades to sharpen like you would a knife.  That's how I kept my manual auger blades sharp.  You only sharpen the angled side."

518758,Cudz,2010-11-09 23:00:00,2652,There is a guy over on blake street across from the care dealer Schmidt and Shaw who can do it. His business is in a little white store.  Just before Blake turns into Penetanguishene rd. near the home hardware store.  He was ill a few years ago but I think he is still in business.
