Walked right across the front yard.. size of a horse. This is probably the little guy Marty came up out of the bush babbling about last year.. lol. All he could get out is I didn't think they came that big...    Terrible zoom/crop.. but look at the height of that rack above his head..  
518680,John,2010-11-09 18:03:00,2956,Nice rack.....
518706,misfish,2010-11-09 19:49:00,29133,Yer an    man.    LOL   Thats a beast.
518707,Harrison,2010-11-09 19:58:00,2202,"Ok Wayne, not sure the deal you have with the other hunters there, but I'll make ya a deal.  Let me have 2 days of bowhunting and in return I'll give you 5 years worth of personal fishing journals in the Sturgeon bay and honey harbour area for Muskie, walleye, pike, crappie and LMB/SMB.  I'll even take the last week in Dec.  Deal??"

518769,irishfield,2010-11-09 23:54:00,26272,But did you catch anything Phil???  Marty and Brian have first dibs... but you never know they may work you in or give you a spot on the 120...
518771,aplumma,2010-11-09 23:59:00,6896,See I told you if you planted the landing strip with Orchard grass you would have a lot of friends Wayne.   Art
518834,Harrison,2010-11-10 12:00:00,2202,"Haha, just kidding around Wayne. I respect other hunters property. However, that is a nice animal you have there.  To answer the fish question....ya we did, but not a lot of muskie info. Then again, a fresh set of eyes on a property could maybe change the luck up a little"
518835,Carp,2010-11-10 12:06:00,1488,That's a nice buck for sure. I have a couple that size hanging around close to home as well. Just haven't got around to paying them a visit yet.
