519058,Muskieman,2010-11-11 02:13:00,2472,I think that Garry has hit the nail on the head with this one but I agree with Roy ... What about the boat?.  Banjo Minnow  and the Flying Lure..  money down the drain.  Although the Banjo Minnow makes for a nice trailer on a spinnerbait   How about the Popeil Pocket Fisherman?   Randy 
519067,Dave Bailey,2010-11-11 02:46:00,1641, HEAR HEAR! Just what I was going to say. Rods after that are merely variations on a theme.
519069,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-11-11 02:53:00,1107, My buddy swears by the banjo minnow he catches tonnes of bass on them I can't catch a cold with the stupid things .

Think you know what they are?  Without further ado...  1. Original Floating Minnow: 1936 — Rapala Perhaps the most popular and successful lure in history.  2. Spring-loaded Bobber: 1947 — Nibble Nabber Found in almost every angler's tackle box.  3. Mitchell 300: 1949 — Mitchell Who hasn't fished this spinning reel?  4. Creme Worm: 1949 — Creme Lure Company The plastic lure that started it all.  5. Closed Face Spincast Reel: 1949 — Zero Hour Bomb Company How every kid learns to cast.  6. Lowrance Fish Lo-K-Tor: 1957 — Lowrance Known as the ""Little Green Box"" that introduced anglers to sonar...the first ones were actually red.  7. Monofilament Line: 1958 — DuPont Stren What did they use before mono?  8. Minn Kota Trolling Motor: 1958 — Minn Kota Lets you crowd that other boat... quietly.  9. Fenwick High Modulus Graphite Rod: 1972 — Fenwick Probably started the ""hold-the-rod-tip-to-your-throat-and-talk"" test.  10. Shakespeare Ugly Stik: 1976 — Shakespeare So tough it could survive a nuclear holocaust."

I spent a lot of time at the Grand River using it and I thought it would change fishing forever. I used to have an old level wind Shakespear reel that my aunt made when she worked at the outfit that made them, I remember pulling yards of black line off it and whipping it like a lasso around my head and heaving the line out for my cast. How the spinning reel changed all that is amazing."

Dad must have seen enough bombs during ww2, I learned on a Langley bait caster. I didn`t use one until the mid 90`s, but give me any semi closed face Abu 500 series reels over any zebco.  They make line other than Stren?  Who the heck are their sponsors? Free spool bait casters didn`t get a nod?  Hmmm, star drags? I remember having to thumb the spool for drag.  The right kind of bait casters, left hand retrieve."

My friend and I were in a Collegiate (think that was the name) Sports in Kitchener, way back then.  I picked one up and attempted to do this, the rod snapped in my hands!!! I looked over at my buddy, said ""oh, no! I have to pay for this!!""  We looked around, saw nobody and hightailed it out of the store!  Good times"

518942,OhioFisherman,2010-11-10 19:14:00,6623," The can be cast, trolled. Like any lure they shine when they are the one that is working. I used them as a twitch bait a lot, cast it into a pocket in the lilies or weeds and let it sit. Some times you could see a bass rise behind it and just stare, a little twitch and they were all over it.  I used them from 2 - 7 inches, sort of a match the hatch thing Silver and black or Perch finish always worked the best for me."
