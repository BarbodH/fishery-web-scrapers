I know in the spring they are shallow and the summer they are deep but this late in the fall I really don't know where to start. The lake is stocked with lake trout and the present population do not spawn , so i'm told (that is why there is no closed season) or maybe they still go through the motions ,I don't know. Thanks"

I have had good sucess this year with the lake trout jigging thanks to some guys on this board and there reports !"
