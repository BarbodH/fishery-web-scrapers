Dave was so stoked to hit 20,000 fans on his facebook page that he decided he's going to take one of his facebook friends fishing!  I would love for one of you guys to feel my pain...errrr uhhh excitement...    and have a chance at winning this little contest they're putting on!  Seriously, I'm positive it'll be lots of fun, and you might just learn a thing or two about fishing.... but mostly it'll just be lots of fun! haha  I'll paste the details link below...  Good Luck, Ryan  http://factsoffishing.com/blog/dave-mercer/i-want-to-take-20000-facebookers-fishing/"
