MIDLAND -- The International Joint Commission (IJC) has directed the Upper Great Lakes Study Board to explore what the effects would be of raising the average levels of Lakes Michigan and Huron.  The IJC directive asks the study board to undertake an exploratory investigation of how raising the Lakes Michigan and Huron water-level regimes by different amounts would affect interests on the Great Lakes system from Lake Superior to the St. Lawrence River.   The move is a direct response to comments received during IJC public hearings last March about a study board report dealing with the St. Clair River's impact on water levels of the Upper Great Lakes. The report recommended that measures to remediate the increased conveyance, or water-carrying capacity, of the river ""not be undertaken at this time."" Public reaction at the IJC hearings -- including the one in North Simcoe -- was critical of the study board's recommendation."
