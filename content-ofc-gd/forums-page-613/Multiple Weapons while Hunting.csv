519046,Nipfisher,2010-11-11 01:39:00,2449,"Here is the post from the OOD Community Forums. I hope you all do not pursecute me for being a member with them too  Thank you for your questions. I will begin by making an assumption – that you hold both a small game licence and a valid licence for deer or moose, depending on which you are hunting.  The actual regulation that sets out these rules is Ontario Regulation 665/98 (Hunting) made under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997. The pertinent sections are 69 and 70: 69. The classes of firearm set out in column 2 of the Table to this section, each consisting of the firearms set out in column 3, are prescribed for the purpose of this Regulation and Ontario Regulation 670/98 (Open Seasons — Wildlife) as the classes of firearm that a person may use or carry to hunt deer or moose.  70. A person who hunts deer or moose shall not use or carry a firearm unless the firearm is of a class specified for use during the open season applicable to the species, person and area in Ontario Regulation 670/98 (Open Seasons — Wildlife). O. Reg. 581/99, s. 4.  So, in answer to your questions:  Q1. Is it legal to carry more than one gun at a time?  Generally, yes, as long as each gun being carried is of a type allowed for hunting moose or deer, as the case may be, during the season in which you are carrying the guns. For example, during a shotgun season for deer, you may carry two (or more) shotguns. However, you could not carry a shotgun and a rifle, even if the rifle was a .22 for hunting small game.  There are some exceptions. If you are hunting migratory birds, you may only have one shotgun that is loaded and unencased. You may have a second shotgun, but it must be unloaded and in a case.  If you are hunting with an apprentice hunter, the mentor and apprentice are restricted to a single firearm between them.  Q2. Can one carry a shotgun for small game and a rifle for large game simultaneously?  Yes, provided that it is a deer or moose season that allows for the use of a rifle. (If you are bear hunting, there is no restriction on the types of firearms that you may carry for hunting.)  Q3. Can one carry a 12gauge shotgun loaded with slugs or buckshot and have birdshot in their pocket for small game in case the opportunity arises?  Yes, provided that it is a moose or deer season that allows the use of shotguns.  Q4. Can one carry more than one muzzle loader at a time loaded?  Yes, subject to the exception for apprentice hunters mentioned in Q1 above.  Q5. Can one have a .22 cal for small game while bow hunting for large game?  This depends on which season for moose or deer you are hunting in. If it is a moose or deer season that is restricted to the use of bows, then you may not carry a rifle of any type while hunting moose or deer. Same for a deer season that allows the use of shotguns and bows, but not rifles. If it is a moose or deer season that allows the use of rifles as well as bows and you are choosing to hunt the big game species with a bow, you could carry the .22 for small game. If you are hunting bear, you may carry a .22 for small game while hunting bear (as long as you are licensed for bear).  I trust this answers your questions.

I read this and would like an answer from David Critchlow regaurding my question about having a shotgun/crossbowbow at the same time. I know I recieved one already from a different person,but from what I read,it would not be illegal,where the response I got,said it would.  Thanks Erich for posting.   I,ll let you know what happens.  Also I would think this would be a good page to print off,just incase."
