518599,Roy,2010-11-09 13:56:00,13728,"I have been making bucktails and other blade musky lures for 5 years or so now for my own personal use. By 2010 I was quite pleased with the quality of the lures I was making I then decided to come out with my own line of musky lures.I am very pleased to introduce the Handlebarz they are made with .062 stainless steel wire,brass beads,size 8 colorado blades,heavy stainless split ring,5/0 treble hook that is shrink tubed, all dressed up with musky sized flashabou that is hand tied by my self.  Here is a picture of my daughter with a 49 1/4"" caught on Bleeding perl Handlebarz during the Belle River MCI Classic she won the event with this fish.  Mike Parker, Handlebarz Lures.    "

518625,Joey,2010-11-09 15:41:00,9122,"I was hoping to buy some at LSC from Mike, but haven't made it down due to the wind this year yet.  Hopefully one of the upcoming weekends Mike, they look awesome.  Joey"
518717,Handlebarz,2010-11-09 20:40:00,3790,Thanks for the kind words Lew and Joey I hope that we get to see you guys this weekend the weather looks great so far but ho knows right this is LSC after all LOL. Thanks Buster  Cram sorry I had forgot to send Roy some pics of my lures here are a couple of them. I am just using a face book account for now but hope to get some extra $$$ and have a web site made for selling and promoting my lures.

518731,aplumma,2010-11-09 21:10:00,6896,Very nice lures Mike I am glad you decided to go public with them.   Art
518766,cram,2010-11-09 23:46:00,1733,Those look like awesome baits.  I especially like Texas Tea on your facebook site.
518811,cwpowell,2010-11-10 03:19:00,265,Pricing?
518817,mistyriver1,2010-11-10 03:47:00,600,"Very good baits indeed, Mike knows his stuff."
518838,Harrison,2010-11-10 12:57:00,2202,"Good for you Mike, great baits and I like the biz name!"
519005,Handlebarz,2010-11-10 23:31:00,3790,"Thank's Art it was a big dissision to make as I was not sure if I wanted to sell them but I did have a bunch of people urging me to try it out and from what I have heard things should go good.  Thanks Jim  Hassison it took a long time to come up with the name it was years in the making LOL.  cram I will try and get some new pictures done I need to build some more I still cant get a nice picture that I am very happy with they seem to not show what I want them to they just look dull from the real thing. Maybe I will get Brandon to take care of that part.   cwpowell the stores are selling them for $16.99 they wanted to go at $18.99-$19.99 but I asked they keep them lower so that more people can afford them that was my main reason to bring the lures out, they are well built with heavy musky size components and not built with cheap product but you can get them for a affordable price.  For now I will offer a 20% OFC discount from the $16.99 price well a little better then that $13.50  each plus shipping or if your in the Chatham area anyone can stop into the house and have a look or I can also make arrangements to meet up between Chatham and Alliston, I head up that way often with work this would save on shipping.   I can make custom colors if some one has a idea just shoot it my way and we can get it done."
519054,Rod Caster,2010-11-11 02:05:00,5784,Nice looking product Mike and a great deal to boot. Every fisherman can appreciate that philosophy.
519241,Handlebarz,2010-11-11 20:56:00,3790,Thanks Rod Caster I did not make it up your way this year I here the water was low how did that affect the season for you?  Here are a couple of the double 10's I made for my self this year and in 2011 I will have them for sale along with other colors.  Blue gill   Confusion   Armageddon 
519254,Rich Clemens,2010-11-11 21:40:00,3131,"The Gold Blades (with a Black skirt) seemed to be the lure of choice for one fellow when he was fishing up at Wolseley Bay the same week I was there.  Nailed 6 in a week with one hitting the 50"" mark.  They really look good Mike."
519338,SlowPoke,2010-11-12 02:54:00,2984,They work!!   Good enough to win the Belle River 2010 Opener Derby!
