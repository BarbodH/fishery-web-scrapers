Both my wife and I are also very diligent in teaching our children that there are many who died to give them the freedom to swim play x box and do the things they do today, they have embraced Remberence day and understand the gravity of the day  My son in grade 5 wrote a poem about today, which was entered into a competition and it appears now will grace the halls of legions, and military bases around this country  Below is his poem  A SOLDIER'S WISH  Im in my final resting place in flanders field's as all us soldiers should be, From time to time I wonder why I joined the Military, My time has come, I have reached the end Lying in my poppy bed, I hope I have succeeded your free today to be, my mission is complete  I bled for you, I cried for you and held my head high for you, Will you do the same for our country  at the 11th minute of the 11th hour please take a brief moment to respect those that died for our freedom"

519259,msp,2010-11-11 21:48:00,1336,"I was at my daughters Rememberance day ceramony today. She spoke her part and moved the entire gym. It is immportant to get our kids involed. Just singing Oh Canada with a Gymnasium full of kids sent shivers up my spine, I was prouder than ever to be Canadian.  "" Do not stand at my grave and weep, I am not there I do not sleep.  I am a thousand winds that blow. I am the diamond glint on snow. I am the sunlight ripend grain. I am the gentle autumn rain.  When you wake in the morning hush, I am the swift, uplifting rush Of quiet birds in circling flight. I am the soft starlight at night.  Do not stand at my grve and weep, I am not there, I do not sleep. Do not stand at my grave and cry, I am not there I did not die! """

519340,irishfield,2010-11-12 02:56:00,26272,Everyone's too busy to get no where Albert.. unfortunately!  I stood quietly in my hangar door opening at 10:59am.. listening to the band I could hear either downtown Midland or Penetang (considering the wind direction I figure Midland) thinking of all those men gone before us and those that continue to serve....... and shed a few tears to boot.  A good lad you've got there Louis... let him follow his dreams!
