Wondering if anyone has any recommendations of places to access Lake of Bays for trout.I snowshoe out with a portable clam hut, so I'm hoping to avoid a marathon hike. Never wet a line in that lake yet, and have heard that there are some nice fork tails to catch. Any information would be helpful. Pray for cold weather!!  GR"
