I was gonna head out to Lac Seul by myself on Sunday and then bumped into a guy i met shore fishing a year ago and he asked to come along...Sven's a nice guy so of course he'd be welcome in the boat.  We had to work pretty hard to find fish on Lac Seul and once you did the fish were sluggish, bellies to the bottom at 25-30 FOW just barely sucking in the minnows, i almost put a stinger hook on, only to find i had left them at home and could not be bothered to fashion one myself.  Sven had not fished lac Seul since he was hauling wood out of the bush some 20yrs ago...so he had a blast and was great company, we could not have picked a nicer day, aprt from temps hovering around + 6 degrees it might have been a mid August day.

Its only 15-20 mins up the road and the weather was spectacular again. Just as i started out the door to sort my minnow stash , the phone goes, Sven was thinking the same as me....so the plan was set...i'd meet him at the corner on Hwy 502 in half an hour. The bite was frantic from the first cast, lots of small fish but great fun, we got a couple nice 17"" keepers and Sven got the biggest today at 23""....perfect end to the 'softwater season'....winterize the boat on Thursday and shore fish till the ice gets here.

518614,Blue Lk,2010-11-09 14:40:00,337,"Good on ya,Simon.I put my boats away last month.Who knew we were going to have such a nice fall? By the way I know Swen,& your right,he is a good guy.Didn't he have a cabin on Eagle?"
518616,danc,2010-11-09 14:47:00,4677,"I was in Dryden yesterday Simon. I couldn't believe that I was swatting flies at this time of year. Have a great hard water season, if it ever comes."
518617,johnnyb,2010-11-09 14:50:00,3413,"Great stuff as always, Limey!  A few more videos of you slipping on the rocks out back, and then all the ice updates...can't wait"
518822,Kwan,2010-11-10 04:38:00,132,these are the best reports ever lol so dialed in

518925,Smarty Pantz,2010-11-10 18:37:00,203,"SweeeeeT!!! Great catches   Now I want to go there....  Hmmmmm, I have the day off, wonder what I shall do?!?!   "
518987,Rod Caster,2010-11-10 22:14:00,5784,Thanks for sharing. It's too dark to fish after work now-a-days....so I fish vicariously through your videos. I caught a nice 23 incher.  
519055,limeyangler,2010-11-11 02:05:00,5204,"Thanks for the replies folks, it really nice to get good feedback, i'd do the reports anyways...but just to say thanks really     Yup, winter starts next Saturday, long range forcast shows past that day temps wont go above freezing again...i'm hoping for a fast freeze up then hit some walleye through the ice, got a couple of new lakes i plan to try right from the get go.    Thats awesome, Sven was talking about his cabin while we were out there, he does not have it anymore, but it was at the southeast end where we were about 2 km away near the pickerel lake creek.    So...you were in Dryden and never brought me a Timmies  JK...you on your way to or from Red Lake?    Could just be creative editing Kwan  ......lol....no...your right, i'm lucky enough to live near fisheries that make catching fish a no brainer...not always trophy...but its very rare to get skunked from a boat....on the ice is a different story for me....skunk quite often over winter...but i cant wait for the ice.   Thanks Corvette, you always find time to post when i do, its appreciated    You have a day off?....its your DUTY to go fishing....tight lines!    Yeah...this dark by 5pm sucks alright, specially for the lake we live on, i always here about great walleye fishing after dark...Wabigoon Lake shuts down as soon as the sun dips below the treeline give or take 20  minutes."
