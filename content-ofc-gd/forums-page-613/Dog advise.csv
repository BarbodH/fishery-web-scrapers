518656,BUSTER,2010-11-09 16:59:00,1336,reading to far into it..   How about dog starts to eat furnishings after 6 years and its perfectly trained.....owners fault bad trainer?
518657,daryl0815,2010-11-09 17:00:00,225,"hahaha wow, I cant believe a simple dog conversation turned so nasty so quickly! Definitely emotions run strong when it comes to dogs.  I, (like most of us here I assume) treat my dogs like members of the family, as they should be treated, I have 3 dogs, 2 Dachsund mixes and a yellow lab.  I have had a Yellow Lab for 12 years, and he is the best dog ever, in general he is the most easy going, well behaving, smartest dog I think anyone could ask for, he is a great companion, and one of my best friends, we crated him for the first few months, and after that he has not had a single accident in the house.  My Dachsund mixes are much younger, (1.5 years and 12 weeks) and they harrass my lab quite a bit, but he just shrugs it off and has never been aggressive towards them, he plays with them, but not rough at all. Labs are excellent with kids, and even strangers, so if you are looking for a guard dog forget it!  As others have mentioned, its not all roses, they do need attention, and excercise, and they can tend to be too smart for their own good. Before we got him fixed especially, he tended to wander alot, and labs do shed quite a bit, so they are a bit of work in that respect. But then again, anyone looking into getting a dog should know that they are in for some work.   Definitely get him/her from a breeder, I would recomend a male, just because I have never had a female one, and my male is so well behaved.  As far as huskies go, I dont have any experience with them, but I love the way that they look, they are one of the nicest looking dogs out there, however I feel sorry for them in the summertime, and I have heard that the shedding is ridiculous.     and he loves christmas presents, he even opens them himself!

518660,John,2010-11-09 17:08:00,2956," Something has changed if a dog starts that behaviour at 10 years old. Is he drinking more than usual? Has his routine changed? Is he sleeping excessively, is he eating as normal?  Perhaps it is medical, the first place I would start, your vet will be the one to advise you.  At the end of the day the dog will not respond to punishment unless you catch him in the act. He does not think he is doing anything wrong.  Buster, I am not bustin your balls....you may need to seek professional advice to help solve your probelm if is not medical.  One of the things that I try to tell anyone who who asks for advice on bringing any pet into their family is the cost of buying is the least of your concern. Vet bills and training can add up to thousands over the dogs life...something to consider."

I have read many a post explaining how they love fishing with their dogs. I also have a friend that takes his everywhere with hime including fishing.  I know that dogs require tons of care. They also give you tons of unconditional love. If they were perfect, everyone would own one (or two!)  I guess you have to weigh the pros and cons in owning dogs. As you said, I own one and would like a larger breed as a companion to take up north with me and for fishing.  Thanks."

I don't have much experience with Husky's but from what I have picked up from watching TV is that Husky's need more exercise and activity they are dog bred to run and pull a sled.  I know a lot of people say labs are great family dogs, which is true of most breeds, but they are also a powerful and cannot be underestimated. So don't assume because of the breeds general demeanor that they won't have issues.  I suggest taking the appropriate training classes, it did wonders for me with my shepherd. Plus I have found Cesar Milan's 3 principles of exercise, discipline, and affection really do work wonders."

I've trained many dogs over the years though, and while we might generally agree that Labs are wonderful, I've seen a few that are dumb as a box of rocks. And that is true of any breed. Point being, do your research on the breeder, visit them, see their dogs and operation, and remember, the initial cost of the dog can be more than offset my medical costs of poor breeding. Labs, like many breeds, are suceptible to certain problems. Allergies is a one that leads to constant vet visits, ear issues and an excess of shed hair. Hip dysplasia, any reputable dealer will have scores for their dogs, heart murmers can be a sign of future problems, and EIC, Exercise Induced Collapse., is a serious and emerging problem with labs that can now be tested for. Do your homework or you may suffer the consequences."
518730,doubleheader,2010-11-09 21:10:00,497," Genetically their is no difference in labs one color to another that would lead to a difference in intelligence. that said, many people want chocolates, and as a result the back yard breeders favorite color to breed is chocolate. Choose your breeder carefully and it won't matter what color lab you choose. There are 3 and only 3 lab colors. Black, chocolate and yellow. The yellow can vary from almost white to red."
518741,bbog,2010-11-09 21:50:00,665,"""Genetically"" your statement may be correct BUT breeding plays a huge part in intelligence, maturity and health issues.

Letting her off leash was always an issue as she wanted to run (forever) and wasn't the best at coming back.  Definite strong personality, very independent.  I think I only ran her to the point she was tired a handful of times, so very high exercise requirments.  Got a chocolate lab pup in May and, he's pretty much the best dog ever, still very high energy and needs to go to the park most days, even though he gets walked for around 5km each day. Runs at the park retreiving and hunting songbirds and ducks for an hour then crashes.  I've found he's very smart, easy to train but want to test who's boss all the time.  On a side note, we had an awesome weekend grouse hunting, it was his 3 and 4th days hunting and he did great. Found birds flushed birds and retreived them.  He gets so upset when I miss, sits and pouts!  Further, to this I rediscovered my 28ga. great little single for beating bush for grouse. Hunting with dogs is a blast."

I cant believe you have had dogs all your life after reading that post.Once a dog lover alwasy a dog lover, and thats a fact. The dog probably senses your negative energy and has lost all of respect for you.THEY KNOW....dont kid yourself.  and before you piss on this, a well trained dog can be left out in the house without worry.I suspect seperation anxiety.It knows how you feel about him or her.Change your attitude, and you will see a differnce."

Loyal, loved fishing and hunting, and was fantastic with kids.  when i was 9 or so we got another pure breed siberian, however, she was a race dog and always wanted to run, we got her at around 9 months which made it difficult to train, but like others have said, this one was born to run, and needed to run everyday, but she was absolulty enjoyable.  we never took her hunting but fishing, she loved!  those dogs have made me loyal to that breed...with a little patients those are IMO the best dogs ever, which made me go to their bigger cousin the malamute 2 years ago.

I can let him off leash and they do like to roam but he will come when called which is a plus. Lots of huskies won't and you have to chase them down for hours.  Depending on the weather he will stay outside when I'm at work. He's starting to understand that being curled up on a nice warm doggie bed is much nicer than sitting in the rain or snow. Last year he wanted to stay outside no matter what, unless I was home.

He is strictly an indoor pet for the kids and I now have a place up north that I intend on spending my weekends fishing both soft and hard water.  I have narrowed my choices down to a Lab (chocolate would be nice) or a Siberian Husky. I realize they are completely different types of dogs and have never owned either. I am leaning towards the Lab as I could use a new fishing buddy as well. I know there are a lot of dog owners on the board and would appreciate your experiences with either breed. Male or female preference?  How are they as family pets? I have a large fenced in backyard and already walk daily (so exercising him/her shouldn't be an issue. I work and my wife is in and out all day running errands for me.  I thank you all in advance for your help.
518467,Handlebarz,2010-11-08 21:07:00,3790,Last year the family and I were going through the same debate I had never had a dog before so we did alot of asking and looking around before we picked out our new family member he is a black lab and has fit right into our family its like he has been here for years. The Labs are so easy to train and super smart. I would not trade him in even thought he is full of energy he is amazing with the kids my son 5 can ride on his back and be all over the dog and it does not fizz him at all.  He oves the boat but gets a little pissy if were not catching fish its funny watching him look at the reel as if he is waiting for a musky to make it scream.  enjoying the boat ride   waiting for the rod to go off   a little ticked off at me when we were not getting fish

She goes on all of our fishing trips, is great in the boat, loves to play in the water, and is a great companion.  I don't think you'll regret the choice of a lab.

My mutt sheds 24/7/365 and has 3 layers of hair!!!! Thank god for winter when the shedding slows down a bit. My husky has taken a lot of work to get him semi trained. Huskies also take longer to mature and settle down than Labs as well. But they are better in the climate I am living in now than a Lab.  Here's a shot of the hairy beast lounging around camp on Great Slave.    Forgot to mention he like fishing and boating too!!!

518485,motion,2010-11-08 22:00:00,403,"Hey mercman, any problems with her going into heat etc.? I know the females are also generally a little bit smaller in size as well (which I wouldn't mind). Dont let my wife know she's that smart though..........."
518486,The Urban Fisherman,2010-11-08 22:05:00,2050,"2 Labs 7 year old named Sheba 10 months old named Princess (name credit goes to my 4 year old daughter)  3 Kids 4 year old 1.5 Year old And a bun in the oven! lol  Sometimes the dogs can be a pain in the    but then again so can my kids and I love them more than the world!  Labs are all around great dogs, especially if you have the time to walk them and train them properly!  It's been a bit o a hurdle for us and the puppy but we've got a fairly busy household.  Lucky for us, and the dogs we live in the country and they have an entire farmers field at their disposal in our back yard!  Cheers, Ryan"
518488,Rich Clemens,2010-11-08 22:16:00,3131,"  Strictly indoors.  Now, labs do shed.  But, in the summer time, we have her shaved.  Looks a little funny being shaved, but it certainly cuts down on the dog hair.  So, our yellow lab looks kinda white, with a yellow tinge, during the summer months.   During the winter, we let her fur grow normally."
518489,bbog,2010-11-08 22:17:00,665,"Not all Labrador Retrievers are created equal. [in general] The chocolate are the slowest to mature and the black are the smartest. The yellow is somewhere in between. The chocolate for some reason also seem to have the most health issues [again in general] usually allergies.  The ""Golden"" is not a Labrador Retriever colour and is actually a Golden Retriever.  The best thing you could do is run your requirements through an online breed selector such as this one.  Breed selector  Everyone on the forum will have their own bias, including me. Another option is to rescue an unwanted dog.  Good luck in selecting your new family member."
518491,Rich Clemens,2010-11-08 22:20:00,3131, Oh yeah.   The father of the lab we have right now is a Grand Champion from Canada.  Good stock from our northern friends.
518492,snoil,2010-11-08 22:27:00,139,Lab! We had a great yellow for 11 years.Wife said he only shed twice a year.True but it was from Jan1-June30 and July 1 til Dec 31!!
518495,motion,2010-11-08 22:35:00,403,WOW! Thanks for all your responses. I knew there were a lot of dog owners on the board but I forgot how passionate most of you are about them.
518504,fish_fishburn,2010-11-08 23:38:00,1311,"I have had Husky breeds for most of my life. I have a 11/2 year old male Syberian right now. They are great dogs but are totally wired for high gear all the time. They can be stubborn at times but are very happy dogs when you put them to work. Mine hauls all my gear out on the ice for me in the winter and just loves it. They are a very loyal dog and like to please but they need alot of your time for training. And when their coat blows out....well let's not go there. There great to take out on the mountian bike cause you barely have to peddle.  If you were to get one, introduce it to the water as soon as possible and you will have a good fishing buddy. You have to watch the heat though in the summer months."
518505,mercman,2010-11-08 23:44:00,7054,"  We had her ""fixed"" so no problems there(not that she was broken ) I had a female cocker once and we didnt get her done.Every month doggy diapers.Get her spayed for sure.Mine was up and around in a day and a half."
518507,mercman,2010-11-08 23:49:00,7054,Oh and BTW i rescue all my dogs.They are just as smart and will love you more.Never been let down.
518534,bigfish1965,2010-11-09 01:49:00,3382,"I have had all kinds of purebreds..lots of golden retrievers. But I have to say that the nicest, most gentle dog I have ever had was my mutt from the local shelter. I got him cause my golden was very active and needed someone that could keep up to him. Jack is a very sweet dog and is very sensitive and likes to talk alot. Labs and retrievers are great with kids. Labs can be aggressive so make sure of either the complete lineage or get an adult with a known history. But overall they are amazing with kids and love to be part of a pack. I do have to give a special push to getting a dog from a shelter when all is said and done. Somehow it seems they are just more grateful.  Kelev the golden retriever...    Jack the pound mutt...sweetest dog ever  "
518554,motion,2010-11-09 04:07:00,403,Here is my little guy Ozzie. He's in great shape for an 11 year old dog. Still very active but surprizingly not a yapper. He really thinks he's a big dog but only 10 lbs soaking wet. Hates water and the outdoors but still a big part of our family.  
518586,Harrison,2010-11-09 13:07:00,2202,"I have had two Labs.  #1 thing with both of them was they HAD to run.  Off leash, either retrieving or just running about in a field.  If not, they got depressed, literally.  They are high energy dogs, that love the outdoors.   Be forewarned, once they are taught to retrieve, it is all they really want to do.  Good luck with your hunt!"
518589,John,2010-11-09 13:27:00,2956," Very cute pup motion.  Would recommend a lab no question. We had Ben our Yellow Lab for almost 13 years. He went to doggy heaven almost a year ago. He was my buddy and I still think about him every day.  Labs are not maintenance free dogs. At certain times of the year they shed like a bugger and need a lot of brushing otherwise you will have hair on every surface in the house. They do need exercise and are susceptible to heat stroke if in the sun for long periods without shade. I can't stress enough that you need to buy from a reputable breeder who cares about lineage and has the background on the sire and the dam. Hip issues, allergies, ear infections are common with labs. Shoot me an e-mail if you want a recommendation."
