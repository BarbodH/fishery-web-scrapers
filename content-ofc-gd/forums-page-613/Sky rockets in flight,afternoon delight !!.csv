518278,ChrisK,2010-11-08 00:28:00,2772,"Got to the river this weekend and found it low and clear. Ive seen it like this before and had great success in the past. Trick is to find the pattern that gets there attention and running light tippets and small floats with little to no weight on your rig. Most of the guys that came and went in the morning were using eggs and pink worms with marginal success but I'm into tossing flies so the pattern of fly and how big was crucial. What also was a big factor this weekend was water temps. Once fly pattern was established and the sun came out the bite was on. I first started tossing out smaller size patterns which included buggers and prince nymphs and a assortment of other types of attractors with no luck until a gentleman I met last week came to the rivers edge and started fly fishing with an unusual large size fly. Almost immediately he hooked up with a fish and it jumped cartwheeling into the air and spitting the fly back at him. Ok,so they want big eh ?? I tied on a #10 sized black bead head woolley bugger and ran the float through the pool. Float went down and my first fish of the day was firmly hooked and kicking up a fuss...The rest was history...Great weekend with 6 fish landed. Not bad for low clear water I'd say... "
