If so here is my question: I have an oppertunity to pick up a MG Brute 56 lb thrust electric trolling motor 42"" shaft 12 V/ 24V...I run a 12 V system..My questions: Is this too much Thrust for a 16ft? Also will there be limitations to running a 12v system as I do not have enough room on my boat to hook up a 24v system? By running on 12v system will I get the most trust out of 56lb or will I just be getting less similar to my current 36lb? My current MG 36lb works great but its better to have more than less! Let me know what you think if you can. Much appreciated"
