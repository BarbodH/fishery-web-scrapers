519114,misfish,2010-11-11 10:41:00,29133,Today is a day to remember and show respect.Myself I have seen the flags on poles at the top and half way down. Can someone tell me what is the respectful way to present the flag today? I want to make sure the proper respect is shown.  Thanks Brian
519117,Roy,2010-11-11 11:08:00,13728,"Brian, on Remembrance Day, November 11, the flag is flown at half-mast from 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon on the Peace Tower of the Parliament Buildings. I believe that this is the proper protocol."
519118,misfish,2010-11-11 11:17:00,29133,Good morning Roy  Thank you.  I will leave them as they are.
519124,Dave Bailey,2010-11-11 12:45:00,1641,"There is one part of flag protocol that many aren't aware of if they are asked to place a flag at half-staff; a flag is never raised to half-staff, it should be raised all the way, left there for a moment, and then lowered halfway."
519131,BUSTER,2010-11-11 13:20:00,1336,In case anyone wants to know you can email your member of Parliament and they'll mail you a FREE full size Canadian flag.

519161,irishfield,2010-11-11 14:42:00,26272,Sorry Roy.. but that is incorrect. On Rememberance Day flags fly at Half Mast from sunrise to sunset on all Government buildings (and at the end of my property where I got up early to lower it). A flag MAY be lowered to half mast at 11am during a rememberance day event.  http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/meb-hm/index-eng.cfm
