517990,Dozer,2010-11-06 13:23:00,896,"So I'm reading through the regulations, zone 17 and it clearly states all rivers open all year from south side of CNR to Lake Ontario.  I've got a lot of people telling me HWY. 2 and south is game.  I just googled the regulations and on the  .pdf file it states the same thing...  Oh yeah, long leads and tangled fish isn't fishing."
518013,skunked,2010-11-06 15:00:00,41,"some places are open to december 31st as an extended season, just  read more carefully. I dont understand how people get confused.. read and listen to what you read."
518016,ctranter,2010-11-06 15:47:00,543," This is bad information.  Read additional opportunities and it clearly states ""Regional Municipality of Durham - all waters between HWY 2 and southerly limit of C.N.R right of way (open for bows, browns, pacific salmon) until Dec. 31st."
518384,torco,2010-11-08 15:17:00,656,"Regs aren't as simple as they use to be, but the above statement is correct as per the regulations. You definitely need to read them in detail.  I believe some people like to tell others that don't read the regs themselves misinformation on purpose for their own personal gain."
518389,ehg,2010-11-08 15:31:00,2666,"Always thought you had to be south of CNR tracks after September 31st as well. Noticed these Hwy 2 regulations until Dec. 31st a couple of years ago. Was told it was like that for a long time, i didn't know either"
518390,solopaddler,2010-11-08 15:32:00,8605,As has already been stated read the exceptions to the regulations.  Many rivers have an extended season 'till Dec 31st that differ greatly from the year round zones.  It's all there if you actually took the time to read the regs.
518430,perchslayer666,2010-11-08 18:44:00,280,Actually all rivers are closed until the opener next year. Sorry.
518456,Dozer,2010-11-08 20:34:00,896,"Yup, I found it, right above where I found the ""open all year"" stuff.  I never fish north of the tracks anyways, yes, I'm still learning and usually just stick with what I know.  Anyways, thanks for clearing it up for me."
518629,fishermccann,2010-11-09 15:51:00,655,"I was on Duffins creek yesterday for a couple of hours, saw some fish but none were caught, had the water to myself which is always good."
