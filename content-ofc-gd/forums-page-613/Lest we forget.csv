518783,mercman,2010-11-10 01:12:00,7054,"  Novemeber is typically know as the month of the dead in many countries.Its a time to pray for and remember those who have died.I use this time to remember my father who served in Korea for 13 months.My uncle Ralph who survived the D-day offensive on Juno Beach only to die years later from shell shock and post tramatic stress disorder, and my great uncle Eugene who died somewhere in France in WW1.They never found his body.All went as young men, and those who came back were older and seldom spoke of what they saw and experienced. Please take the time this week to honor a vetran,remember a familly member who served, or pray for our soldiers still in action. ............................................................................ In Flanders fields the poppies blow Between the crosses, row on row, That mark our place; and in the sky The larks, still bravely singing, fly Scarce heard amid the guns below.  We are the Dead. Short days ago We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, Loved and were loved, and now we lie In Flanders fields.  Take up our quarrel with the foe: To you from failing hands we throw The torch; be yours to hold it high. If ye break faith with us who die We shall not sleep, though poppies grow In Flanders fields."

Take two minutes, would you mind? It?s a pittance of time For the boys and the girls who went over In peace may they rest, may we never forget why they died. It?s a pittance of time  God forgive me for wanting to strike him Give me strength so as not to be like him My heart pounds in my breast, fingers pressed to my lips My throat wants to bawl out, my tongue barely resists  But two minutes I will bide It?s a pittance of time For the boys and the girls who went over In peace may they rest, may we never forget why they died. It?s a pittance of time  Read the letters and poems of the heroes at home They have casualties, battles, and fears of their own There?s a price to be paid if you go, if you stay Freedom is fought for and won in numerous ways  Take two minutes would you mind? It?s a pittance of time For the boys and the girls all over May we never forget our young become vets At the end of the line it?s a pittance of time  It takes courage to fight in your own war It takes courage to fight someone else?s war Our peacekeepers tell of their own living hell They bring hope to foreign lands that the hatemongers can?t kill.  Take two minutes, would you mind? It?s a pittance of time For the boys and the girls who go over In peacetime our best still don battle dress And lay their lives on the line. It?s a pittance of time  In Peace may they rest, lest we forget why they died. Take a pittance of time      "

518812,irishfield,2010-11-10 03:22:00,26272,"Paul.. we can never forget!  My father was one of the lucky ones.. enlisted against his Mother's wishes at 17, did all his boot camp and then the war was over. Discharged in April.  My brother did 20 years in the CAF.. Herc Squadron Commander out of Trenton. Every hell hole in the world including the Gulf War. He doesn't talk much about his deployments and many he can't talk about.. because they ""didn't happen"" according to our government. He has so many things tucked away in ""invisible boxes"", to get out at a later date, he can be a hard person to get to converse. I can't imagine what some of the WWI and WWII vets have/had in their ""invisible boxes"" that they lived with their entire lives and never spoke about."
518815,mercman,2010-11-10 03:44:00,7054,"My dad was in the RCEME Royal Canadian Electrical Mechanical Engineers.He was not on the front lines, but followed the troops, repairing artillery and inventing solutions to the problems faced.Before he died, i got one story from him.He was on his  back,checking the plates under a sherman tank.One of his buddies was clearing a birds nest from the end of the big gun.A third mechanic was climbing down into the turret and accidently fired the gun with his foot.Dad said he heard the bang and felt a weight on his chest and slid out from under the tank, to find the lower torso of his buddy in a heap beside him on the ground.He carried that with him and let it go 6 months before he passed.I can't even imagine"
518825,Tybo,2010-11-10 05:52:00,1373,Dad had an interesting story to tell about WW2.Being Polish he fought for the Germans(not on his own accord). He was In  France when he got captured by the Americans.He and four buddies ran from the lines and start to look for the Allies.He told me that he walked right up to the American lines unnoticed.The Americans their were busy digging in. Dad said they where so close by time they got notice(four guys in German uniforms) the sentry almost crap himself. After his release he joined the Polish army and went back to Belgium to fight the Germans. Three Uncles also fought. My uncle Alfonz fought beginning to end.
518844,fishing n autograph,2010-11-10 13:28:00,2540,"I've been doing geneological research on my family. I've found 8 relatives who served in WWI, one KIA in France from shellfire. I've located the cemetary and where he is buried.  My grandfather participated in the Italian Campaign for the 24th Royal Field Ambulance and rescued the wounded. He actually was shot through the calf, at the same time that his apppendix burst.  My great uncle served for the RCAF in India as an air dispatcher"
518853,The Urban Fisherman,2010-11-10 14:13:00,2050,"My great Aunt Bee, or Grandmother depending on how you want to look at it. (she unofficially adopted my mom - long story) Anyways, she was a young girl in Holland during the war and her father was part of an underground group that took in mostly Canadian soldiers with the odd American or British soldier, hiding them until they could get back to safety.  One time a Canadian plane went down near their farm and her Dad hid the soldier in a pile of hay, then ran across to the other side of his field so when the Germans showed up they'd poke around in the wrong hay bales.  She has all kinds of stories about the war and the men that they helped along the way.  She told me once a couple of German soldiers wanted her dad to give them his bike.  He told them he didn't have a bike, but when they found it in one of the barns and they were going to shoot him for lying.  One of the soldiers must have had a heart, because he stopped the guy with the gun.  Eventually I believe her dad, who was fairly well off lost most of what he had owned and ended up moving the family to Canada.  Shortly after establishing themselves here she fell in love with a German/Canadian man and married him.  Her dad was pretty upset.. but my Uncle Harvey is the sweetest man alive!  Anyways, that's my association with the war.  I've got more stories but have to get goin'!  Remember those who fought, and the other heroes we don't hear about, like my Aunt Bee's Dad who took in many Canadian soldiers during that time.  Cheers, Ryan"
518976,mercman,2010-11-10 21:38:00,7054, Great story Ryan. we oft forget the everyday civillian people who risked thier lives for our soldiers.They are just as much heroes as the soldiers themselves.

519019,mbac31,2010-11-11 00:05:00,904,"The only one that was in the  war from my Family was my Grandpa,who recently passed away. I would have liked to have his medals but the family decided that he had earned them and that he was to be buried with them. Rightfully so I guess. Never spoke about it and Im actually glad he did not. I'm very glad they did what they did to make our lives better. I would not wish something like that even on my worst enemy. I never use this day for rememberence only, I remember often. I just hope that they turn it into a national day.  Here is a video from Youtube. Great vid http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InztCEsi-7w"
519057,splashhopper,2010-11-11 02:10:00,2931,"Father was RCAF for 20 years. Aluminum repair tech on aircraft.  Now my youngest daughter is in Air Cadets. She is the only child or grandchild to enter in to any arm of the Armed Forces.  Tomorrow, my daughter will be marching with the other cadets to the cenotaph here and town and my father will be marching with the vets from the legion. After the services, we will be meeting up and hopefully getting pictures of the two of them in their respective uniforms together."
519078,tb4me,2010-11-11 03:36:00,3295,"I’m watching some TV having to do with the War and Remembrance Day tomorrow.  Nice to think that the people (mostly) still care enough to have the ceremonies in honour of the Vets and all those who serve their country.  During the war not just those who served in uniform, but the factories that worked around the clock and the workers who put in 60 hours and more a week.  It wasn’t an easy time.  And people complain about high taxes today – wages were controlled and there were two rates of income tax.  Those making better than average wages – paid an extra tax that went into a “savings” account – this money wasn’t returned until after the war. Anyway – I think it’s nice that the kids have to go to school – otherwise they probably wouldn’t know much about the wars of the past.  There are those who don’t care.  Some outfit which is opposed to wars and fighting – have been trying to get people to buy and wear white poppies. What an insult to the Veterans and the traditional red poppies.   War is hell as anyone who ever had to fight in battle – but the pacifists are unrealistic.  If you’re familiar with Kenny Rogers’ song “The Coward of the County” – at the end the “coward” says “Sometimes a man just has to fight.”  Didn’t intend to preach – I’m just talking. Nedless to say our family will remember. Our youngest son is in year 3 of the Navy Cadets and will be there for the ceremony.We are so prod of him as he plans to join the Navy when he is out of Highscool."
519092,bigugli,2010-11-11 04:21:00,6138,"My Unle Bob was with the RHA in WWI. He was at the first gas attack at Ypres. When the French Zouaves ran, his battery drove their gun teams in to plug the gap til the Canadians and British could close the gap. They had to shoot the horses. They survived and kept firing the guns despite the gas. They peed on the hankies and tied them round their face to partly neutralize the effects of the gas. He lived to be 90. Rarely spoke of the war, would not go to the legion and never mustered on the 11th. He did not want the reminders. My uncle was an RCN lifer with the carriers. Some of the prangs he witnessed and photographed were horrifying. I was amazed he never got caught with his camera. My cousin was another RCN lifer as a comm. specialist. Got to be aboard the Ottawa on her last flag waving tour before being consigned to the knacker's yard. He spent 4 years living out of his kit bag while attached to NDHQ. Every time our peacekeepers set up a new post or go on another peacekeeping mission, he was there to set up the comm network. The father in-law was a field surgeon attached to the GGFG through the war. I now have a nephew who recently completed his training as an aviation tech. I wish for him a long and exciting career. As a reservist I was fortunate to never be directly in harm's way. Sadly I have known far too many who were not so fortunate in peacetime. Even in peace, service is an hazardous profession."
