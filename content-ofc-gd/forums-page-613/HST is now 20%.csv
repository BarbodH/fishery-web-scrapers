That fractional cent ratio adds up to a big bonus in some government pockets. REAL PROBLEM.  Thanks for mocking me for being concerned. You're probably right. We'll just sit back and let the government keep finding new ways to take away what we earn.

Loblaws for example has used this money to fund a number of initiatives geared toward ""green"" solutions. There is not legislation in place that requires these companies to use these monies in any particular way. The only money the Governement will see out of the sale of plastic bags is taxation on the bags. And that my friend s is a whole new can of worms.

519024,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-11 00:19:00,0," No over thinking here. I know whats really going on. Your nation was founded on slavery. Then they adopted capitalism, but the real success of America lies in the fact that it was the only country whose economy was not left in ruin after both world wars. In fact? They made money. Thanks to their geographical position(the war was never fought on its soil).  The rest of the world was left in economic ruins thatnks to the world wars. This is why wealthy European banks moved all their assets(gold reserves) over to the USA, and invested in it. America is financed by foreign private investors via the Federal Reserve. Yes, European wealth.That is the reason it is successful.   It had very little to do with capitalism. Now what you have in America is the furthest thing from capitalism, and not because of Obama. It has been in the works for quite some time. Companies are getting so big there is no competing with them. Thanks to government handouts. This is not capitalism. WHen government has to bail out big businesses? It is a clear indication that capitalism is a failure.  Leveling the playing field has had catastrophic outcomes?LOL Can you give us an example? Capitalism works really good for the first few years of injected cash, because it creates wealth on credit, but when those countries can no longer pay their bills, it creates mass poverty(through inflation). We have seen what happens to many capitalist countries when they cant pay their bills. This is very close to happeneing to America. Then we will see how much you love the capitalist system."
519029,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-11 00:25:00,0, Probably.  They charge taxes after your dead.... Inheritence tax or death tax was used to steal land from many people in England.....What a scam......

519068,ctranter,2010-11-11 02:47:00,543,"  You might wanna rethink that one.  I've taught elementary and high school in the states and it's no secret that your educational systems are failing you.  In 5-10 years, USA will be far behind China, India, and most of Europe in math and science development, unless something changes now (which your government has proven is not their priority).  For example, I've taught in Buffalo which boasts  a 50% drop out rate in high school.  Obviously this is an extreme example, but expect other failing economies to follow suit, and once their do, your ""most powerful nation"" will be catching up like everyone else."

I also paid my $.05 for a plastic bag to hold it in and much to my suprise there was an additional HST charge of $.01 on a 5 cent bag. so my math puts that at 20% HST.  pardon my language but WTH!!!!!!! I know it's only a penny but really, do they need to round that up?  If the bag only cost a penny would they round up the HST on that??? (100% HST)  just can't win in this province  just my $.02 (+HST)  jjcanoe"
518558,crossover,2010-11-09 05:58:00,172,"When you do the math of 13% HST it comes out to 5.65 cents, so it does make sense to round up. Do the environment a favour and buy a reusable bag for 99 cents."

I'd say that's a real problem."

518571,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-09 12:05:00,0," I dont have a problem with grocery stores going green.Plastic bags will be a thing of the past(Environmentally unfriendly), BUT! This H.S.T., G.S.T really sucks! How they were able to get away with it? I don't know. History tells of revolutions after revolutions of people who rebelled against their leaders for implementing unfair taxes. Americans cry about having to pay 6%. We are at 13% and taxed on everything.So when is enough, enough? 20%, 30%, 40%??(That's how much of our pay is being tax.)We are taxed when we earn it, when we spend it, ect....  Don't look to the rich or business men. They MAKE money off the G.S.T(they are for it). The Poor? They are not smart enough to see what is going on or to do anything about it(disorganized). And the middle class has somehow become complacent.The money the government makes is enormous. Just on taxes from cigarettes, alcohol,money from lotteries, gas,ect... the gov makes a killing. Where all this money goes is anyones guess.Is there a government webpage that shows how much tax and revenue is made annually(by the government) and how it is spent? If not they should have it!"

The LAST this we needed was an 8% hike on things like gas. I just shake my head at Ontario sometimes. Alberta may be cowboy central but at least they know how to make some money off of their resources. Ontario has MASSIVE gold and precious metal deposits (Ring of Fire in James Bay lowlands, Timmins, Kirkland, Wawa) yet they have no idea how to take advantage of it. There was a 100 billion$ Chromite deposit in the Ring of Fire  that McGuinty said in Feb 2010 will be our cash cow and what happened........Sold to Cliffs Resources (USA) for 120million! This WAS owned by a 100% canadian company. Why do loser business men always get into politics? Because they can't make money as loser businessmen."

518580,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-09 12:45:00,0," Alberta is getting tons of federal dollars(Our tax money) thrown their way thanks to their puppet conservative leader Harper. Harper is part of the Mulrooney cabal, that started selling us off to the States and every other foreign investor. It should be illegal for the government to sell off or Privatize government infrastructure! That's OUR country's resources and belongs to we the people. We have no Monarchy here in Canada, or do we?  Now the trend is that both the liberals and the conservatives who are both pro money, are selling us off to the highest bidder. This is weakening the Government's over all assets and wealth(and thus influence), and increasing the influence of foreign big business in Canada. I'm guessing these politicians are making back room deals and putting cash in their pockets at the expense of Canadians and our resources. What these politicians do when they come to office is figure out how much money they can put in their pocket, in the short amount of time they are in office. Best way to do that is to raise taxes, sell off government infrastructure or have people start paying for a service that was once free......  I have very little faith in politics, regardless of whether they are liberal, Conservative or NDP. But I say it's time to get the conservatives out of Federal office and put in a liberal French man! They seem to do the best jobs.  McGuinty has to go, and I'd vote for anyone that lowers taxes(I don't think that has every happened in the history of politics, false promises to do so, plenty). I'm glad Ford won as mayor, but only time will tell if he is effective.  We need to start another grass roots political movement here in Canada(and not have it hijacked by the elites like in the USA). First thing you would have to do is open a political site/message board. That would run you minimum $1500 a year. Then you would have to spend some money, advertising it. Then you would have to get followers, and people want to follow someone with influence, and influence is only given to people that are pro elites.  But if enough people got together, the elites would be inclined to listen or face backlash."
518581,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-09 12:51:00,0," What are you talking about? Our government was more socialist and now we are becoming more capitalist. The government is selling off all government infrastructure and privatizing it. And the result is the cost of living is soaring! Now we are like America, where Corporations run Government. Not Government runs Corporations. Harper is a puppet of the oil industry. That is who financed this guys rise to power.  Less money the Government has? The less power and influence it has and the less social services it can provide for the people. You think the privatized companies will provide free services? They will start charging for things that were once free."

518587,DanD,2010-11-09 13:21:00,2223,"I know exactly how you feel jj no matter what we buy, what we do; there’s always a taxman around with their hand out. The only thing now is; we can see the taxes we’re paying; not like before GST, where the feds took their bite (at whatever level of tax?), at the manufacturing level and it was hidden in the purchase price. Back then you had to be a frigging accountant to figure out how much of this or that item we bought was tax. What gets me are things like what they’ve done AGAIN with tires here in Ontario and no one is saying crap about it? The “Ontario Tire Stewardship fee” of $5.84 per tire; is a fee that is again applied at the manufacturer’s level; sound familiar? No it’s not hidden but it sure is a pretty way of saying TIRE TAX! A tax that is filtered all the way down to us and guess what; we also have the privilege of paying HST on the $5.84. We have to make sure they don’t start applying this type of “fee” on other things; just because it’s the “green thing” to do. As far as I’m concerned; the only thing green about this one is the glow from the money they’re getting; it’s not from the grass or trees it’s supposed to save. Helping the tire recycling businesses get established; yea right! Why should we all be paying to help independent businesses get established? If I’m wrong; where’s the line up for me to get my cut? I have my own recycling business. I eat marigolds and crap out Pot-pourri. It’s a great line of crap; you’ll get use to the way it smells as long as you don’t look at it to closely; just like this tire fee. Sorry you got me started JJ? LOL  Dan."

518592,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-09 13:32:00,0," I think they put the tire tax because its not environmentally friendly, but someone I believe in Canada? Figured out a way to make sidewalks with it. They are testing it out now to see how it makes out against the cold and salt. If this proves successful? They should remove this tire tax altogether.  And I agree! Why should we help independent businesses get established with our tax dollars? Even if it is a government program. The gov will turn around and sell it to the highest bidder once it becomes profitable anyways!  Speaking of recycling? In Europe they pay YOU for your garbage(Its recycled and used for bio energy).Here they charge US!! Even though they are making a killing with recycling cardboard, paper, wood, plastic, metals, ect...."
518626,rapala14,2010-11-09 15:42:00,44,"We will be taxed until the government gets the perfect/near perfect equilibrium for making max profit.  Its like gas prices.  If the price of gas is ""too high"" people stop driving, find other ways of getting around or just cut out certain trips all together etc.  If the price of gas is ""too low"" they're missing out on profits.  But if its ""just right"", people are still doing all the things they want but pay maximum price.  As for the price on plastic bags... thats bull.  I don't recall a price drop in any groceries since paying for plastic bags.  Or a program put in place to help the environment with the monies made with the implementation of this price on plastic bags.  The reusable shopping bags is a great idea.  I'm glad people do it.  Keep up the good work!  But to make people pay for plastic bags all of a sudden and put it under the facade of ""going green"" is ridiculous.  This is the kind of crap that spawns the tire tax and oil filter tax.  Give'em an inch and they'll take a foot"
