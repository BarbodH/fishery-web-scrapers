The one I lost jumped a good 4 feet in the air thrashing like a madman and threw my bulldawg! Had a few other follows, and many follows by other species as well... what is a walleye doing chasing a bulldawg??? Trying to get it's number??? First fish was a 45"", the second 43"". Had audiences for both fish, they were impressed at my camera setup and how easy I can take decent muskie pics when solo. I put in a full 12 hours fishing hard the whole time, I was hoping for a few more than two but I guess I shouldn't complain too much with the season I am having...  45""   43""   "
