874975,captpierre,2014-10-01 20:08:00,2521,Couldn't help but notice the increased number trolling on the weekend.  Hope they are just passing thru and not new resident birds  Peter
874976,rooz,2014-10-01 20:10:00,11,"I was probably one of them   , been trolling on pigeon for couple of weeks now! tell me your secrets capt pierre!"
874977,davey buoy,2014-10-01 20:15:00,5505,The trees were full of them this past weekend at a certain spot in Simcoe.Not seeing the numbers diminishing at all.
875054,Sinker,2014-10-02 04:01:00,8692,"The migration has started. There will be more to come, then they will be gone until spring.  S."
875055,fishindevil,2014-10-02 07:47:00,6254,Perfect time to be shootin them !!!!!! Seen about a dozen last weekend on a lake east of Bancroft too !!!! There's more & more of them every year for sure !!!!
875066,BillM,2014-10-02 11:55:00,17367,Lots and lots and lots of the buggers around.
875074,Big Cliff,2014-10-02 12:46:00,6899,"Perfect time to be shootin them !!!!!! Seen about a dozen last weekend on a lake east of Bancroft too !!!! There's more & more of them every year for sure !!!! MNR will tell you to kill a round goby if you catch one, they are an invasive species. I asked about shooting cormorants and I was told that if I was caught, I'd be charged. When I pointed out that they were also an invasive species the conversation ended right then and there. Anyone know the logic behind that?"
875076,BillM,2014-10-02 12:49:00,17367,Shooting a cormorant is a bit different then slamming a goby off the outboard don't ya think?
875077,Headhunter,2014-10-02 12:49:00,5703,"Cliff, gobies are ugly and don't have any animal rights groups fighting for their existence... Cormies do. HH"
875079,Headhunter,2014-10-02 12:50:00,5703,Only if the cormie spits up a gobie Bill! HH
875086,AKRISONER,2014-10-02 13:45:00,5558,welcome to life on GB...friggin buggers...to shoot all the ones in PAB id need a friggin Gatling gun
875118,Sinker,2014-10-02 18:04:00,8692,"At one point in time (DDT days), cormorants were near being endangered, and put under protection. Now that they have come back so well, they are a nuisance, but still protected under the same act. I'd love to be shooting them. If a season was ever opened, I would be the first in line to get a license. I have plenty of chances to shoot lots of them, but let them all pass me by, and watch them catch fish all day long.....sometimes hundreds of them in a small area, just cleaning it out of any fish. It sucks!! There are days at the peak of the migration when I see more of them than ducks or geese. Its sad.  S."
875122,Consigliere,2014-10-02 19:09:00,121,"You should see what they've done to the small islands in Lake Ontario and St. Lawrence.  Previously green, treed and lush are now bare rock covered in hundreds of cormorants.  They kill everything around them."
875144,Big Cliff,2014-10-02 22:01:00,6899,Shooting a cormorant is a bit different then slamming a goby off the outboard don't ya think? The result is the same Bill and if left unchecked they will both have a serious effect on our native fish populations!
875146,Big Cliff,2014-10-02 22:10:00,6899,"You should see what they've done to the small islands in Lake Ontario and St. Lawrence.  Previously green, treed and lush are now bare rock covered in hundreds of cormorants.  They kill everything around them. There is a small island on Sturgeon Lake, it use to be lush and green now it is barren and white. The only life on it is cormorants and a few trees that are fading fast. Every year we see more and more of them, I guess we'll just have to wait until they take over the area before someone does something about it."
875175,Sinker,2014-10-03 01:35:00,8692,Maybe the cormorants will eat the gobies by the time we can kill a few of them off?  S.
875195,fishindevil,2014-10-03 07:30:00,6254,There is now a pretty good population on a few small islands in the Ottawa river and I have been fishing there for well over 20yrs and they were never there till about 10trs ago !!! Every morning just at daylight they leave the island and fly directly up the petawawa river canyon right into Algonquin park !!!! They are eating the lakes out of brook trout as well and are becoming established in the park too !!!! Brutal I have been into the MNR OFFICE IN PRMBROKE  AND TALKED TO A BIOLOGIST and didn't get anywhere as they were saying they need more info and tagging results !!!! Blah blah blah !!!! Basically said they are or will not be doing anything !!!!! Same old answeres ....... They are spreading all over Ontario for sure !!!!!!  Gobies & cormorants !!!! A new fact of reality of fishing in Ontario !!!!! Grrrrrrrrrrr
