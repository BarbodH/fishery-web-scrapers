Wish the musky would have co-operated but it was a good time.  Sunrise the first morning      Got our only musky in the major feeding period of the new moon 15 minutes aftyer getting on the spot     We caught a few incidental fish through the 3 days and all pike caught ended up as fish fry   For those interested this is my bait that is the last one in existance that caught the fish and always seems to catch musky for me   Now to get out for some splake soon.
