873696,Canuck2fan,2014-09-23 14:53:00,1444,"The China sites do have some good quality products for good pricing, if you can get direct from source. It only makes sense every middleman doubles the price of anything he moves or he goes broke and does something else... I know a guy I met fishing a few times, who makes walleye rigs and he said when he found out the contact info of the Chinese company for the exact same supplies he had been buying in online from the States his costs dropped 60% for the hardware, shipping was free (where it had been almost as much as the cost of the product) and no brokerage fees now because they will ship it to the customs office near him which the U.S. supplier wouldn't do. So now he clears it himself for the nominal fee customs charges and the duty. I asked him did he drop the price to his customers for the finished product he just laughed and laughed...  The only downsides to anything I have ordered is the long wait time for free shipping, and if you like something you might not be able to order it again. I got 30 packages that had 2 each of the BEST clip on chemical lights I have ever used for .30 a pack. I didn't want to order more in case they were crap. As soon as I got them and found out how good they were I tried to reorder 100 packages. The link didn't work anymore... I found other sites that had the product listed for about 40% more which was still a great deal, but they were all sold out too. Just seemed strange someone spent the time and money to develop and perfect the product with packaging then it just seemed to have disappeared."

The supplier only gets your money once you receive your goods and are happy that they match the description. You can get some amazing deals and most of the prices include shipping for free.  http://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=fishing+hooks&catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20140923104253 Those are the search results for fishing hooks. Sometimes it's worth the gamble. I'm in the hockey equipment business. Some of the sticks you'll find on there are knockoffs, others are actually manufacturing for some of the biggest brand names in the world and selling the sticks out the back door for more money. Great deals can be had but be careful."

Only Owners for me. Strongest hook on the market in my opinion.  So true... hook strength is everything.  I was at a local fishing store a few years ago and this guy was in and we started talking to the owner about breakoffs. The guy was having a problem with hooking up with lumber in the rivers he was fishing and then breaking off leaders. He was using much higher line test than I or the owner went with and we snap tested some he had brought in and all seemed good with the line... So the owner said he had this BRAND new hook from Raven specially designed to bend and then come out in such situations. The guy grabs a pack saying GREAT!!!!  Now we all know what happened... About a week later I run into the guy who bought the hooks pier fishing. He had 3 straightened hooks in about an hour. He was going to go and tear the owner of the store a new one. I asked why? You bought those hooks to fish in creeks with tons of logs and branches in them not off a pier, where there is nothing to break off on... He packed up and left he was so mad.  LOL"
873745,MJL,2014-09-23 21:20:00,2427,"I try to use the best hooks I can find. You never know when a fish will take you for the ride of your life.  When I fish steelhead on the west coast, Owners and Gamakatsu are the only ones I take (recommended by the local guides out there). They're the only ones that survive the punishment from those fish. I've seen no-name brand hooks break in half on those fish. Nothing hurts more than flying or driving across the country only to lose a fish on something so preventable. "

This is nothing new as they have been producing many different brands of hooks that will bend when hooked in timber. Crappie fishermen have been using a Aberdeen Hook for many many years.  ""Nothing hurts more than flying or driving across the country only to lose a fish on something so preventable"".  Another quote that brought a good smile to me because then what do most Steelhead anglers do once they land that monster fish or really almost any steelhead. They release it.....LOL. Welcome to the long distance release program. And now that fish is as big as ""the story"" you tell because as always, the big one got away."

873764,Salmonidstalker,2014-09-23 23:27:00,265,"In my opinion to thoroughly enjoy the pursuit of fish, one should be comfortable and prepared.  If you have to worry about whether your hook is going to hold, you've already lost."

Amen to that Cliff. Last Christmas I bought a Chinese shot gun because it was cheap and got berated by many (who have never fired one let alone owned one) saying it's junk. So far I have cycled many  a load through her, cheap shot, expensive, 2 3/4 and 3"". Never had an issue. Killed a few geese in early season. A few weeks ago I bought a brand new Mossberg 500, mostly for the barrel combo, and the very first time I fired it, it cycled and spit out an unfired round from the mag. Needs work right away. But my Chinese special has never failed from right out of the box.  In fact it will be with me on tomorrow's opener and the Mossberg will be in the safe.  Just goes to show that you don't knock it till you try it."

All they do is slap their logo on it and make a 400% profit on it.  With that being said, the Chinese makers now have the blue prints for the top fishing gear used world wide, they make it with a slightly different design, and slap a different label on it, and charge $50 for something that cost them $5 to make.  From talking to multiple sales reps (Shimano, Zebco, Loomis, Orvis, Redington, Sage) these Chinese knockoffs are just as good if not better than the brand name gear.  @$5 for 1000 hooks with free shipping, its worth a try, if the metal isn't great, you know what, you're only out $5.  there are plenty of ways to test out hooks at home before you get on the water"

When it comes to hooks, as a angler you should be able to examine and determine quite fast if the product is quality or just junk. Worth looking into if you are using / selling a lot of products with hooks.  My question for the OP is why the secrecy here. Why not just post the website and let the reader decide if it's a deal for him or her ?"
