I will tell you right now, There are no pikes out there with markings like that."

The Balsam population is pretty strong now. Musky numbers of the smaller year classes seemed to have dipped a bit for me on balsam recently, but could just be me..."

Since this post, there have been pike caught in many of the Trent Severn waterway lakes so I've heard.

No worries rooz and totally agree with you about the pike in the Kawarthas.  It's a shame they are spreading like they are.  Will be interesting to see how things balance out in the next 10 to 20 years.  Welcome to the board!

875015,jedimaster,2014-10-01 22:56:00,3472,Mine in the above was a Barred musky. You can tell by the pointy pec fins. You can see in the OP's picture the fins are rounded. That's the easiest way to tell. Now to check if its a male or female... you need to insert your finger into the...

875056,fishindevil,2014-10-02 07:59:00,6254,The fact is they are here in the kawarthas !!! Including the lake I live on which is sturgeon lake !!! As they have been steadily invading a big portion of Haliburton !!!! They are confirmed in most of the kawarthas it just takes the MNR several years to officially confirm it !!!! A few years I ago I called the MNR about a lake in Haliburton they said had NO PIKE !!!! Well I caught one and measured it and took pictures and sent it to them and last year finally confirmed there is pike there !!!!
875063,Parnelly,2014-10-02 11:28:00,108,"The first year I bought my boat....2010, I caught a Pike on the Otonabee River. Being that I was new to fishing the area, and really hadnt done a lot of fishing in a long time (I know this was stupid looking back) but we released it back into the river not knowing. The next day at work I was telling some guys that worked in another trade about my fishing escapades, and I dont need to tell you they were less than happy about my story. Needless to say, that wont happen again."

487161,fishnsled,2010-07-21 15:03:00,3520,A good friend of mine caught this fish on a Kawartha Lake a couple of weeks ago.  It wasn't Balsam and it sure looks like a tiger.  Just looking for some opinions on the fish and if it is a tiger.  The markings would say so but I seem to recall that the tail should have rounded tips.  Difficult to tell in the pic but they look pointed to me.  What do you think?  Tiger or not?  If so this could be bad news for another muskie lake in the Kawarthas.  I've been asked to keep the name of the lake private and will do so. 
487162,craigdritchie,2010-07-21 15:05:00,1586,Tiger muskie - no question about it.
487164,alexcba,2010-07-21 15:08:00,634,"could be, but it looks more like a barred musky to me. im no pro on the subject tho. maybe if we had a clear shot of the tail, the paired fins look like they are more pointed rather than round.. cant really tell tho."
487165,ccmtcanada,2010-07-21 15:13:00,7971,"I'm not an expert either, but I found a ""how to identify pike/muskie/tiger musky"" picture on the web...  I'd have to agree with alexcba...looks like a barred muskie....and as Will said the rounded tail is a key identifier.... a better tail shot would make it easier to identify."
487167,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-21 15:16:00,2690,"Just looking at the head alone, I would say Tiger for sure."
487170,fishnsled,2010-07-21 15:21:00,3520," In images you posted Cliff the Barred musky seems to have a ""clean"" face.  Where as the tiger has markings on it's face.  A better shot of the tail would have been nice.   There was another pic sent but the tail is cut off.  Damn photographer!  lol!"

487270,steverowbotham,2010-07-21 21:16:00,1800,I would say a tiger musky.

If you do think it is a Hybrid, take a close up of the cheek and also of the submadibular pores. These are very important identifiers.  Will, please check your PM's.  Cheers, Ron..."

487490,bucktail,2010-07-22 16:37:00,1857,Im sure the Ministry would be interested in knowing which lake it is.
487495,Aaron Shirley,2010-07-22 17:08:00,655,"Looks a lot like a tiger, but as Ron pointed out, it can be difficult to tell by colouration alone.  Hope it isn't a tiger for the sake of the lake, but it may be the future of the Kawarthas unfortunately."
487522,jimmer,2010-07-22 19:19:00,2730,"Why is the lake such a secret? Rice Lake on the east end has the greatest threat to get pike and Cameron Lake on the west is the next lake in line after Balsam (already known to have large tigers).  If it's Cameron, it's all down stream from there for the pike, which is the worst scenario for the Kawarthas. If it's in any of the lakes between Rice and Cameron, it's too late."
487671,Sinker,2010-07-23 05:52:00,8692,"I don't understand the big secret either. If your worried about pike in the lake, set up a kill derby and we'll all come out for a fry  I'm going to guess its rice though, just for fun.  s."

874933,Craigson,2014-10-01 18:17:00,117,"Just curious, why the concern for these lakes? Just the fact that there are pike in the lake? (If so im guessing they will over run the musky population?) Wouldnt someone have caught pike in these lakes prior to catching the tigers?  Or maybe the concern is that if a pike breeds with a musky then that musky doesnt reproduce more musky that year??  Just interested, thanks in advance"

Looks like a tiger for sure, but a pore count would verify it for sure, keeping the lake or river system a secret is stupid on your friends part, and its that mentality that is part of the problem, its no secret Pike are in several of the K Lakes with documented Pike and Hybrids coming for Balsam, Cameron, and Pike coming from Sturgeon, Rice, and the Otonabee River south of Lock 19, and im sure there in others, just not populated enough to show up in catches,"
