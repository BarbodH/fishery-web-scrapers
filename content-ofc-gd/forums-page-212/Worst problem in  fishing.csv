874829,spincast,2014-09-30 23:56:00,3279,"Worst? Gotta agree that a hook to the eye is probably the next worst thing after death.  But in the past (in no particular order):  - I've left rods & reels behind at the river only to realize the mistake 2hrs later when I finally got home  - I Hit the river only to realize that I left my wading jacket, lures and bait at home  - I Tumbled down a muddy hill into a giant patch of poison ivy a few times  - I got a hook in my hand while trying to unhook a pike. I was attached to the lure, which was attached to the fish, which was thrashing around and biting me at the same time.  - A couple years ago I tried strapping some remote camera equipment to a tree at 4am one cold morning. I fell from the branch and into the river. I got some sweet shots though.LOL  - My Islander float reel took a long tumble down the path to the Whirlpool...One of the sliding rings came loose on the rod handle. That was before the stairs were put in. OMG - I split a gut over this Mike - hilarious. Sounds so like some of my adventures.  There are a few sweet river spots I no longer visit thanks to the poison ivy patches.  Had a bass and a jerk bait introduce me to the real reason they are  called jerk baits. Did you know Bass make a funny crunching sound when you squeeze their skulls really hard as they flail the treble in your thumb right up to the shank. We were both making some pretty jerky movements with that bait. I cant touch that tree one tho."
874447,creditmaster,2014-09-28 22:05:00,190,Hey guys i was just fly fishing for some evening trout  and WHIPPED myself in the neck...   i think that this is the worst thing that can happen (eccept for loosing a fish) for flyfishing.what do  yo guys think?
874449,Joeytier,2014-09-28 22:07:00,3990,I think you should wear protectice eyewear at all times while flyfishing so you dont find out what's even worse!
874452,creditmaster,2014-09-28 22:21:00,190,lol yeah i wear polarized shades
874468,livinisfishin,2014-09-29 00:42:00,661,That is some very sound advice and definitely should be taken into consideration lol
874472,FloatnFly,2014-09-29 00:52:00,1640,"shatter resistant eye protection, even when its not sunny is a must, the fly travel around 140mph at the end of your line,  and would also suggest a wide brimmed hat to protect the ears.  in the spring i had a gust of wind pop up and wrapped my leader around my head, the fly stuck into my cheek below my sun glasses."
874473,BillM,2014-09-29 01:06:00,17367,Worst problem when fly fishing?  When big fat resident browns roll on your fly and fail to hook themselves

I wear a brimmed hat to protect the back of my head and neck. Eye wear as previously stated, is a must as well. One time while fighting a large crazed coho, a weighted fly tore loose and struck me in the right lens of my poloroid glasses. Without the glasses Lord only knows what might have been."
874476,creditmaster,2014-09-29 01:15:00,190,yeah once i  hooked my self in the leg without realizeing it and then tried to cast again and tore the hook out     hurt like hell

874522,Tom McCutcheon,2014-09-29 14:04:00,627,"I know of a fellow who may chime in here, who was fly fishing for Muskies with the appropriate sized fly (10 -12 inches) and caught himself in the back........."
874544,canliq,2014-09-29 16:39:00,24,"Can't say to much, because not often do fly fishing. So far I knew, that is depend on the way you do the casting, special with heavier fly lures like for Musky. And also you got to know your rods capacity , your fly reel and your line. We can't used  fishing for Bass and fishing for Musky on the same rod. Maybe that the cost problem you get hook your self. Beside using proper safety equipment like sunglasses, hat and wader."
874547,Tim Mills,2014-09-29 16:51:00,476,Hooked my ear with a weighted sculpin (barbed) casting in the canoe. Had to paddle back to shore for the pliers to cut the hook.  Went back out fishing afterwards. It was a waste of a good fly.

874556,canliq,2014-09-29 17:52:00,24,"You right, all is depend on your casting ability. Usually if I go for Bass, I'm using 6wt rod, and musky I used 8wt rod. Both rods is from Orvis. For me the worth from fishing, fell to the water when standing on kayak when straight with Musky,"

874712,James77,2014-09-30 14:33:00,175,The worst thing that can happen is you can't go fishing because you have to work. That happened to me this weekend and was heartbreaking.
