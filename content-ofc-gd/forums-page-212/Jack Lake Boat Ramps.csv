The only one I am seeing is way up in the north end, Anchorage. Any local knowledge would be great, we will have a couple of 4 wheel drive trucks if the ramps are a little dicey."
874707,leaf4,2014-09-30 14:19:00,2466,"That's the best boat ramp I know of, my dad's cousin has a place on fire route 85 and we set in there, had two 18 1/2"" boats there last October, watch out for water levels as they drain it for the winter, through the channels especially we scraped the skeg on some rocks on both boats last year lol"
874719,jimca11,2014-09-30 15:18:00,34,did you have any luck?
874725,leaf4,2014-09-30 15:55:00,2466,"We did alright not huge numbers, I think if we tried deeper presentations we would've done better I think big bass for the week was just shy of 4lbs, and managed a musky at 36"" while trolling for walleye which we only managed 9 between 6 people over a weekend. mainly targeted bass but when they were off we went for panfish and we managed a bunch of decent sized crappie and bluegill that were easy picking with just a hook and worm"
874727,jimca11,2014-09-30 16:04:00,34,"glad to hear that, we actually like the panfish for a good fry, any good spots for the crappie, we will be in sharp bay."
874730,leaf4,2014-09-30 16:20:00,2466,we did have a go to spot but for the life of me I wouldn't know how to get there haha sorry
875044,ckrb2007,2014-10-02 02:23:00,449,The water level there is super low this time of the year. The 2 marinas at the end of Jack Lake road are your best bets to launch. Sharpes Bay is the deepest part of the entire lake and the roughest when there is any kind of wind. It's been a tough bite there this year. Lots of numbers but not a lot of size.
