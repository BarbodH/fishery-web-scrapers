874724,Beavertail,2014-09-30 15:53:00,331,"Hey guys, I'm thinking of swapping out my 25hp Yamaha 4-stroke for a used '99 Yamaha 30hp 2-stroke. Just wondering if any members have experience with this motor. I like my 25 but it seems a little underpowered for my boat (560lbs rated for 35hp max), especially with 2 or more people on board. I was wondering about reliability and low speed trolling - which I do quite often. Would I gain much top end/hole shot or would it not be worth it?"
874735,mike rousseau,2014-09-30 16:36:00,4661,It'll be a gas pig compared to what you have now... That I promise you...  And if your a troller then 4 stroke is a way better option the 2 stroke...  The 2 stroke can do the job but it'll be louder... Probably not as smooth at idle... And burn more gas...  In my opinion you'd be sacrificing about 3 good traits if a 4 stroke just for a BIT more power
874737,Beavertail,2014-09-30 16:40:00,331,"Thanks Mike, appreciate it. Those are really good points to consider. I definitely like the fuel consumption and quietness of the 4-stroke."
874746,2 tone z71,2014-09-30 18:16:00,1311,that 3 cyl 30 Yamaha will run circles around that 4 stroke ...Circles !! it will smoke yep.. there a tough reliable powerful engine thou I've had several
874813,chris.brock,2014-09-30 22:51:00,4053,"I had a Yami 30hp triple ,2 stroke, tiller, I now have a Yami 25, twin, 4 stroke on my pontoon boat, both very different engines, I would stick with your 25 and accept the slower top speed, no question"
874817,Cosmos,2014-09-30 23:04:00,588,Do yourself a favor and get 30 hp ETec 2 stroke. Fuel consumption is unbelievable. Performance is awesome. I would never go to old  2 stroke again.
874824,Fisherpete,2014-09-30 23:33:00,1814,For 5hp more I would not do it. As others have said too many benefits with the 4 stroke for a minimal gain in power. If it was a 40 maybe...
874835,Pigeontroller,2014-10-01 00:25:00,2793,Are you nuts?
874837,scugpg,2014-10-01 00:52:00,1373,"I would keep the 25, ensure you have it propped correctly and the motor is the correct mounting height in relation to the transom to get the most out of it.  I'd never go back to a 2 stroke."
874838,Terry,2014-10-01 00:54:00,14456,20% more horse power will make a difference  but if you like trolling slow for long hours  keep the 4 stroke
874862,porkpie,2014-10-01 04:21:00,2521,That's not a trade I would make.
874895,Beavertail,2014-10-01 14:47:00,331,"Thanks for the input guys, I may as well keep the 25 for a few more seasons. Not enough gain and too much to give up by the sounds of it. If I could put a 40 on it, now that would be ideal. In the future I will definitely have to start a new thread ""how to talk the spouse into letting you buy a bigger boat!!"""
874906,floater,2014-10-01 15:41:00,220,"I have the same 30 Yamaha 2 stroke on my 14 foot sylvan troller. Fuly loaded with two guys and three batteries, trolling motor and a pile of tackle and food I get up to 42 kph. But it does suck the gas and will only troll down to 2.2 mph."
