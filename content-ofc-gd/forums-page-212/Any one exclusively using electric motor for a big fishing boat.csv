874844,CRAPPIE,2014-10-01 01:19:00,213,Any one exclusively using electric motor for a big fishing boat like 17 feet fishing boat? What is the advantage and disadvantage ?

874861,Freshtrax,2014-10-01 04:05:00,2215,http://www.elcomotoryachts.com/products/elco-ep-motor.shtml  Correction none here is.
874879,OhioFisherman,2014-10-01 12:43:00,6623,"We used to have electric only tournaments here on some of the smaller water supply reservoirs, gas motors weren't allowed to be used on them. Some guys had 19 foot Nitros and Tritons, but the lakes were usually under 60 acres and a 4 hour tournament.  We also have some bigger water supply reservoirs that are 800-1000 acres and electric motors only, those generally don't even allow a gas motor on the boat. I have seen guys run two electric motors and have 6 batteries in their boat, but 16-17 foot boat was usually the max on them.  We also have a number of limited horsepower lakes here, 10-20 Hp, it not about how fast you can go? It's about how many you can catch?"
874923,John,2014-10-01 16:58:00,2956,Take a look here. Lots of pontoon boats run on electrics on no motor lakes especially in the US  http://www.minnkotamotors.com/
874926,Terry,2014-10-01 17:16:00,14456,"in ontario, if it's a no motor lake then no electric too but the are also no gas engine lakes and you can use electric"
874931,John,2014-10-01 18:11:00,2956,"in ontario, if it's a no motor lake then no electric too but the are also no gas engine lakes and you can use electric Yep you are absolutely right Terry I meant no gas lakes. Not sure if the distinction in the US is the same.. Minnkota and I'm sure other manufacturers also make saltwater electrics too. I have actually seen a high capacity electric perform on a 22' deck boat on a California and Nevada lake and they are quite impressive. Initial and replacement battery cost is high. A lot of those lakes have recharge stations at ""marina's"" dotted over the lake, for a fee of course."
874934,mistaredone,2014-10-01 18:19:00,913,I have a 75lb thrust MG wireless that I get 5 mph on my 16' bass boat. I barely run my gas engine but need it 100%
