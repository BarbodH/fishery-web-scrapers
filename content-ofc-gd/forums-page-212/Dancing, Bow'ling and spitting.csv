But this high stable pressure system we have had this week got me stoked; the lake has a chance to set up. The reports were coming in that the bows were playing deep. Saturday saw me anchored with family commitments, but Sunday was another matter.  Decided it was time to do some north shore fishing, so Port Credit was the host for the day. G and I grabbed our Tim's treats around the corner and headed into the Lakefront Promenade. Setting up in the dark, we were on the water and running as the sun started to peek   second line was just down when the dispsey fires. a short tussle, and she shakes it off. Re-set. The 4th rods is getting rigged, and the #1 rigger fires. G goes again, and she spits it out after a 3 minute tussle. At last all rods get set up and .... we hit a lull. G starts to get anxious, and I say, don't worry bud we'll get one............. hardly was the word out of my mouth than the dipsey fires again. Third time's a charm. .  My turn - it takes me 4 hits to finally boat one.  and then we hit a flurry. Honestly lost count somewhere around 19 hits. We had one BIG bow slam one rigger and get off, and he rolled right into the next one, and tumbled out of that. No sooner were the rods all out than the 10 colour core with the reef runner (and 100 yrd section of braid fires). Had to slow the boat down to bring this one in. Once boat side, doesn't he decide to run rings around the rigger cable. I let him take what he needs but keep just enough pressure on. Tired from the 1000 foot swim, we managed to boat this one. There were a lot of short strikes and soft mouths today - all but two spat the hook once they were in the net. We had them releasing themselves in the air, in the water and at the net. It was great to finally have the kind of  Lake O day we are used to having. Had one hit the rod so hard it went straight down, then straight up and then just bent as the fish made a run        sweet satisfaction "
