874334,EC1,2014-09-28 03:35:00,930,"Hey all, just wondering how many km's should an old Johnson 2 horse should run on one tank(inside motor). Ran out of juice a couple times in the past and felt like I didn't get much out of it. 5-6km if that. I would assume it fits about 1 - 1.5L of gas. Thanks for any tips!"
874337,Wagoneer,2014-09-28 04:42:00,118,My Suzuki DF6 (4 stroke 6hp) could easily do 15-20km on the 1.5L internal tank. That was at about 3/4 throttle @ 15km/h.  I'm sure you're doing WOT with the 2hp and going maybe half that speed so you're going to see a lot less range with it. With my DF6 I always had a 5L jerry can with me and I never worried about running out of gas even for an entire day on the water.  Is it smoking regularly? Does it have a high speed jet adjust screw on the carb that you can lean out? Straight mix 2 strokes are always going to run very inefficiently at WOT.
874339,vance,2014-09-28 05:13:00,719,I have a 1971 2hp and i only use it to troll on my 12ft boat. It runs for ever and I am not sure how long it will go.  vance
874359,BillM,2014-09-28 14:11:00,17367,I would think that thing would go forever on 1.5L of fuel.   Unless you're winding it out the entire time?
874376,Joeytier,2014-09-28 16:19:00,3990,My merc 5 hp can typically run 5-7 hrs on the internal tank (likely 3 L).  Thats a day of trolling and 20-30 mins WOT time
874461,EC1,2014-09-28 23:56:00,930,"Fortunately after the first time I ran out of juice, the jerry can stays in the canoe. I have a feeling the motor may be leaking gas - starting the motor in a bucket results in a stained bucket. It practically is a must to run WOT for me to make it worth putting on the canoe as the trolling motor runs about 5km/h and the Johnson hits about 11km/h Thanks for the heads up everyone."
874485,chris.brock,2014-09-29 02:06:00,4053,"5 kms doesn't sound right, sounds like some problem  on a side note, never tested it, but I've heard, cut back just a little from WOT, you loose very minimal speed, but get significantly better mileage"
874512,Steve1991,2014-09-29 12:49:00,27,"My 3.3hp, 2-stroke will get about 11km on 1L of fuel at WOT."
874538,mepps,2014-09-29 16:06:00,1301,"I've got a 1978 Johnson Seahorse and I can get about 7km on a full tank running full throttle on the back of a 16 foot canoe (side mounted). I should be able to get more, but my motor misbehaves when its bellow quarter full for some reason.  My max speed according to my GPS was 9.9km/h."

Sorry to kinda thread jack but I'd check your fuel pump diaphragm if it's acting up when the tank isn't completely full. Usually a tell-tale sign of a torn diaphragm."
