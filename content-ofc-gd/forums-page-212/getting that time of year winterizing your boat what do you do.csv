873985,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-25 07:55:00,8243,"Regan, I have to disagree with you here. My boat is parked at my place and it's about 100 feet from Lake Erie. 100KPH winds would rip anything but shrink wrap off in one storm. My neighbor had his snap down travel cover ripped to shreds. I guess it all depends on the environment.  I always run all 3 bait/livewell pumps while pouring some RV antifreeze through them. My last trip I pull the plug on the ramp and drain every drop of water out. I put shreds of Irish spring soap in containers all around the floor, supposed to keep little wire chewing critters out, and she likes it too. If a mouse wants to get in plastic won't stop them. I saw one go into the plug opening one year. Oh yea keep the plug in."
873992,spincast,2014-09-25 10:22:00,3279,"Guess I'm in the minority (again )  - I pay my marina to winter and spring service the whole thing, along with my mid season oil changes. I figure given the investment, ensuring that it is done right is worth the minor extra cost when I compare the true cost of my time and the disposal of the environmentally unfriendly fluids we're draining. Plus they know me (I'm invariably the first spring service) -so you know those mid summer days when you need something done quickly?  ""Hey, Kirk, its Rick... any chance you can slip me in before the weekend?"" ""Sure thing Rick, bring her and and I''l have her ready for you by Friday"". I have been able to get that kind of support even during the swamped periods. Relationships like that are priceless IMO.  4 Years ago I spent an afternoon on Kijiji looking for inside storage. $55 a month from November to March. Travel cover on, dryer sheets and moth balls selectively located (like everywhere), and duct tape over all openings. Touch wood, so far never an issue. The boat may be built to handle the outdoors, but there is no question that overtime paint will fade less and materials in general will be in better condition if they are exposed less to the elements.  Come spring I don't have any garbage to throw out, frame / tarp to store or time other than a 20 minute drive to the farm.  And I love looking in the mirror after a long winter seeing the boat trailering behind me visions of spring browns and kings playing through my head."
874006,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-25 13:29:00,8243,"spincast, up to this past winter I just paid Fishmaster Hardcastle in Dunnville to do the winterizing before he shrunk wrapped my StarCraft ( he does a great job by the way). I watched a dozen YouTube tutorials and drove the boys here nuts asking them how they do it. I watched Featherstone Ted do his 90 Merc while I took notes and video taped it. That's it I asked? Yep that's it. I did it myself this past fall under the watchful eye of Obie Wan Ted. Plus I added a few things he didn't do that I saw on You Tube and from reading about this here and on other sites. But I have to tell you I sure was nervous until Spring when I took the shrink wrap off and fired her up. The engine would not start, no way, no how. I was freaking out. Ted came over and started it for me. A tad too much fogging agent. Once she started she has run like a clock all year. Can troll down to 1.8 with the 115."

And now you're a old pro and can help others to do the same. I thought you were going to tell us you forgot to put the plug wires back on. Did that once and laughed and laughed to myself why it didn't start. My BIL had a old 1974 7.5 Merc that I sold him and it ran REAL rough he told me until he pulled the cover to see neither plugs wire was connected but only laying against the plugs.  Once you do it, it's like riding a bike, you will never forget and the best part is YOU know that it was all done and done right.  Don't forget to lube the prop spline, use a NEW stainless steel cotter not aluminum or you might be buying a new prop next year.  Also grease every zerk fitting you can find, especially the steering mechanism."
874011,bigbuck,2014-09-25 14:00:00,2449,"I/o's are different animals than outboards. An outboard will drain when lowered, an inboard is always full of water unless it gets drained. Manifolds, the block, water pump all need to get drained. Do it properly by the book and you will not have a problem. As for tarp vs shrink wrap, if you are sheltered from the wind, tarp is fine, if not, shrink wrap it."
874754,Joeytier,2014-09-30 18:42:00,3990,Just changed my gear oil in my 2001 5 hp to find this... How milky is too milky?  Time for new seals immediately?  
874769,Bernie,2014-09-30 20:11:00,3190,"Time to get that one checked out Joeytier.Often it's just in need of new gaskets behind the screws, but check for fishing line in front of the propeller.At least get the lower unit pressure tested."
874771,irishfield,2014-09-30 20:15:00,26272,"As Bernie recommended!  I've had slightly milky oil in our 25 Honda for a few years come fall... and have always forgot to get new plastic washers and then it's too late when we have to leave camp suddenly as I drain and refill the day we're closing up camp and storing the boat. Last year I remembered to buy some new washers and put them in place. Draining last week the oil was as new, and the boat was in the water for just over 4 months. I was ready for a prop shaft seal job and 1.78 saved the day!"
874780,Mister G,2014-09-30 20:24:00,1429,I agree with new upper and lower screw washer/gaskets. Refill and check again next season after 2-3 times out. A little water goes a long ways to making oil milky. You will probably be A OK as long as water didn't pour out of that lower unit.
874785,Joeytier,2014-09-30 20:45:00,3990,"There was no water that came out, and I only bought the motor this summer so who knows how old the is actually is.  The 2 screws used for refilling actually didn't even have washers or gaskets on them, which I found to be odd!"
874793,Pikeslayer,2014-09-30 21:47:00,1443,"Guess I'm in the minority as well. Fortunate to have a certified marine mechanic who lives 5 km from the dock. He's always quick to respond to any issues when the boats in the water so I'm happy to give him the extra $$ for storage & winterizing @ the end of the season. The Mercs been idling a little rough the past couple of weekends, so we've arranged to do a bit of fishing in the next couple of weeks so he's familiar with the issues. I'll pick her up in the spring and she'll be good to go"
872860,skinny,2014-09-17 01:40:00,442,ok so seeing as how I have more boat than I had before and it fiberglass inboard I need to take care of it for winter I'm planing on having it shrink wrapped but looking for other pointers  like fill motor with rv antifreeze and drain all oil from out drive  what else 
872881,Paudash,2014-09-17 03:17:00,273,My question is shrink wrapping worth it
872891,skinny,2014-09-17 08:59:00,442,my boat will be outside all winter I tried the tarp thing last year and was not happy with what I found  so I thought I would try wrap
872900,Bernie,2014-09-17 10:18:00,3190,"Properly done, shrink wrap is a good way to store. Make sure to build the supports strong and high enough for snow to slide off.Install vents as well.I'd leave the oil in the drive. Just crack the drain screw to check for any water in the oil or drain it out and refill. The oil keeps the gears from getting rusted from condensation. Some IO's (Older OMC units) also have two areas that have gearcase oil. The upper housing also has gears that change drive direction that require lubricant.Careful with filling the block with antifreeze. Make sure you drain the block by removing any drain screws first."
872901,dave524,2014-09-17 10:25:00,4508,"I wouldn't be draining the oil from the outdrive unless you are going to replace it with new. I can't imagine an I/O is different from an outboard in this regard, leave the outdrive filled for the winter,  just make sure the lube is in good shape with no water in it."
872909,2 tone z71,2014-09-17 14:18:00,1311,we just pull all the hoses off the block at the lowest points and remove the drain cocks from the manifolds etc ..check the gear lube like Bernie said if its milky ..drop it and change it ..remember that water got in somehow thou..good time for new seals both gear case and drain screws...Shrink wrap is the only way to go @ 10.00 ft
872913,Raf,2014-09-17 14:27:00,3495,"mine was outside last year, I built about a 5.5' tall a-frame placed inside the boat out of 2x4s and covered with tarp.  worked well, lots more airflow available than shrink wrapping and no snow accumulated.  this year, she will be sleeping inside.  my 4stroke is dead easy, change the engine oil and lower unit oil.  I run stabil in the tank the last few times I am out in case I need to put it away earlier than expected.  batteries come inside for the winter."
872915,bigbuck,2014-09-17 14:27:00,2449,"Befor I pull it from the lake I drop in stabil into the tank and go for a quick blast and then pull up to the trailer and fog it first. Lots of fog down the carb till it stalls out. Then after it is on the driveway, I change the engine oil and filter while it is still warm. Replace fuel filter/water separator. Drain the block and manifolds completely, air does not freeze (this coming from a tech who spent many years in Alaska servicing boats). Change the impeller if it is due and do any work lon the engine bay now, check the drive belts, etc..... Disconnect and charge the battery while doing all this. If you have a trolling motor, charge its batteries as well. I then move to the outdrive and drain the gear oil being careful to check the old oil carefully for signs of water and/or metal shavings. refill with oil. Make sure the drain plug is out of the transom and then put the frame in for my tarps. Cover the prop with a couple garbage bags and tape off with masking tape. Kiss her goodnight and park where it will spend its winter. Iboats.com can be a great help as there is info specific to each motor/drive. Also lots of really knowledgeable guys that can help you with specific issues."
873062,LesCulpJr,2014-09-18 16:13:00,75,"I start running stabilizer in my fuel the end of august ""just in case"" I don't use all the fuel up by the time I put the boat away . Gas now days is only good for about 60 days anyway. If your engine is fuel injected it may not stall out for you if you are using fogging oil. Just keep spraying until she starts to run a little rough and it starts to smoke. Check the gear oil for sure and replace if you detect water. If you keep your boat on a trailer when not in use you'll want to drain the block and winterize it soon as all it will take is one good frosty morning to freeze and break some thing. If you keep your boat in the water at a dock you'll be alright for a few weeks yet  Manifolds go for about $1500 each and up and they aren't cheap to ship:) A new block will cost $5000 Don't wait too long!  Like previously suggested there are a couple web sites and no doubt youtube videos to aid you if you want to do the work yourself. Having work done at a marina will be about $250 plus parts give or take.  We use antifreeze after draining water from the block again ""just in case"". It really sucks getting your boat out the next spring to find you missed a drain plug somewhere! Especially if its someone else's boat! lol. It happens.....  Its good to do all your maintenance in the fall that way when spring comes all you have to do pull out the boat, hook up the battery and go!  Les"
873067,Bernie,2014-09-18 17:55:00,3190,Every year we get three or four boats in with cracked something from those that did not properly store.Expensive repairs.
873069,lew,2014-09-18 18:34:00,12766,"A bud had a 90 HP outboard and couldn't be bothered winterizing it in the fall. Just left it hanging off the back of the boat outside all winter and didn't even bother throwing a tarp over it.  It was a very ugly sight in the spring time and very expensive to put back together again.  Sometimes it's OK to say ""I told ya so"""
873075,musky666,2014-09-18 21:13:00,126,"I usually Musky hunt into November, so I change gear and lower unit oil in mid October while still fairly warm outside. Also change crankcase oil mid season since I troll a lot- just to help keep things clean."

873782,Steve,2014-09-24 00:52:00,2075,"I find the best solution to winterizing is never to do it...just fish 12 months a year and all is good.  thankfully with the Niagara River, Port Dalhousie, Quinte, and other year round fishing locations available, that is possible for us Ontarians.We are very fortunate in this province."
873811,Joeytier,2014-09-24 08:06:00,3990,Except 95% of the province doesnt have open water in the winter lol (not in terms of population obviously).  I'm usually forced outta the boat by early to mid november

Change it once a year in the early fall, and your good to go.  Explain to me how an E-Tec does that?? So you push a button, and the etecs check the lower unit to make sure its not full of water?? Riiiiight!!! Let me know how that works out for you come spring when your lower unit it split wide open because there was water in the gearcase and it froze solid.  I'm like Steve.

As much as I hate working in the boat when it's cold out, I hate looking at a tarped up boat on a sunny 10 degree Sunday even more. I do the lower end and RV antifreeze the livewells early, but the rest has to wait!"

I clean the terminals then use maintenance chargers on all batteries all winter, clean the boat as best I can in late season, fill with stablilized fuel, run some freeze through all pumps, blow out speedo line, check lower unit oil, build 2x4 frame, cover with travel top, then second tarp. Jack and block trailer to mildly relieve tires.  Oh and I prop open all compartments..toss in all kinds of dryer sheets..don't know if it keeps animals out but it sure smells nice in springtime."

I am lucky as I have one but sometimes I really don't know when the last time out for me is, so this procedure can be done every time you think it's your last time out.  Proper fogging a engine is almost as important as attending to the lower unit. Skipping that procedure is stealing years away from the power head."
