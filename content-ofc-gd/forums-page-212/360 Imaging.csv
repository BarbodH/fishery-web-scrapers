874464,sofabed,2014-09-29 00:22:00,119,Does anyone know how to mount 360 imaging from Hummingbird on a Terrova electric motor? It appears the bracket is designed to fit the cable style electric motors not the wired motors units. I am looking at purchasing 360 imaging for the front of my boat but I don't want to have to take it off and remount every time I stow and deploy the electric motor.

On the Fortrex or Maxxum models only the inner shaft of the trolling motor turns, the outer sleeve stays stationary.  You need something that's going to keep the 360 orientated properly at all times."
