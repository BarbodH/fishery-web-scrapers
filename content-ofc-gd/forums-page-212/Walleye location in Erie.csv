Today he went to Port Burwell,  myself, not feeling like doing a 4 hr round trip from home. I could go to the BOQ if I felt like driving for so long.   So hoping they can still be found out from Port Maitland.  Has anyone had any luck out there lately?  Any info would be appreciated.  Regards"

That doesn't mean they aren't there. We went out twice this week out of Nanticoke and I didn't have to clean a fish.  I can tell you for certain that the Jumbo Perch are hitting in 60 feet of water out of Pt. Colbourne, so says the local perch guru, you know gurus. It will be easy to know exactly where this weekend if it is true, just find the pack. Good luck."
874358,davew3,2014-09-28 14:10:00,430,Well I caught one out there.  Just dropped my worm harness down and within 30 seconds it was on.   Though I was going to have a day like Corvette's.  Must be nice.  At what speed were you trolling at?  I tried from .5 mph to 3.  marked lots but no other hits.  Regards
