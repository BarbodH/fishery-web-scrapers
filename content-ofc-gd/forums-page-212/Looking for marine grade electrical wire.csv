874459,steelhunter,2014-09-28 23:32:00,81,"Going to be wiring my boat for a few things (nav light, bilge pump, fish finders, acc lights) and I am trying to find a place closer to richmond hill that sells it . I found a place in mississauga but that's a hike for me. Anyone know of a place closer. I am looking for 12 or 14 gauge wire. I will need about 100ft"
874463,Fisherman,2014-09-29 00:15:00,7201,"Well there's this place, http://www.hollandmarine.com/ and http://www.westmarine.com/ or maybe some marine shop closer to you"
874510,mark demmery,2014-09-29 11:49:00,68,try Sayal Electronics if they have any locations close to you.  I had good luck there finding wire and connectors when I did a complete interior. They had light stuff and the heavy battery stuff too.
874526,Tim Mills,2014-09-29 14:53:00,476,central marine markham?
874552,steelhunter,2014-09-29 17:24:00,81,Central had none Going to mississauga Thanks for all the info
874645,Canuck,2014-09-29 23:45:00,491,I second trying Sayal Electronics.  They have the heat shrink connectors and the tinned copper marine wire but not at all locations.  THe one in Burlington used to have it.  Another place you can get it reasonably priced is at a marina with a service department.  They have it in bulk and will sell you what you need.  Another tip is to buy a cheap labeler like a Dymo.  Then get the outdoor grade label material and label your wires at each end.  It will look professional and will save you time if you are not colour coding each wire separately.
874657,steelhunter,2014-09-30 01:44:00,81,Thanks for the tip canuck
874658,NANUK,2014-09-30 01:44:00,797,"Marine wire is tinned, The Rigging Shoppe has it in all sizes and sell it by the foot, they are located on Midwest rd in Scarborough"
874660,irishfield,2014-09-30 01:57:00,26272,Save the running around and just order some good stuff from Aircraft Spruce. Probably cheaper than marine supply houses anyhow...  
874742,steelhunter,2014-09-30 17:34:00,81,Thanks for the tips ended up getting it at sayal. Had to call a few to find it. Got 100ft of paired black and red tinned copper wire marine grade wire for 40$ Thanks for all the info
