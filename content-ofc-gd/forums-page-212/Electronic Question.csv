I've checked other dispaly models at the stores and both the Elite 5 and 7 have this problem.  I called Lowrance and Navico, they've had numerous complaints and all point to the speaker.  There's apparantely nothing to be done with an update. Now for the electronic wizards,  is there anything out there (reasonable small size) that will act as an external pick up (microphone), amplifier and speaker that will increase the volume to a useful level?  I hate dragging cannon balls on the lake bottom, especially around Owen Sound where the depth can vary greatly in very short distances.  Thanks."
