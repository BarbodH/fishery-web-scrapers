The thing hit like a tank and turned out to be smaller than it pulled. Always nice to get the hit when holding the rod. I hope the lake traffic slows down soon! "

874726,mattybculp,2014-09-30 15:56:00,388,"jimmer if you think pigeon was bad saturday you should have seen rice lake it was absolutely nuts. I swear every boat that was out was fishing. I travelled from the otonabee to past the Ouse and every decent spot from top to bottom had 5-10 boats on it. Just crazy. I wasn't going to put up with that so I headed in. Can't wait for mid October. Less people + decent weight muskie = a good time. Going to be out on pigeon this Saturday, it will probably still be busy. Nice ski."
874733,captpierre,2014-09-30 16:26:00,2521,"You did well.  I struck out.  Met a group of Yanks....party of 15, had 2 fish to show for them all fishing 3 days on North pigeon."
874736,jimmer,2014-09-30 16:37:00,2730,"Caught it on a large safety pin spinner bait with double stinger and twister added to it, trolled on the edge of a weed line. That's a tough fish for the group you met up with Capt. I still say that Pigeon is one of the toughest lakes in the fall. Added boat traffic just makes it tougher. I probably would have done the same thing Matty. I just can`t believe the numbers out there fishing."
874796,SuperDave,2014-09-30 21:55:00,204,Rice Lake had a Muskies Canada outing that would account for a few boats.
874797,cowanjo,2014-09-30 22:03:00,249,"I love pigeon in the fall pattern works every year the fish are predictable, fish rocks no, fish points no, fish humps no, fish like they are bass no, fish rocks front of big island - no fish where docks used to be no - troll deep water - no - in the end every time one of the No's turn to yes and then  you look around. They pattern all the time. They will not chase spinner bait and want to chase rubber. Then if pigeons not working go to the rice beds in little bald or rocks in Big bald, its about pattern then when you get one slow down and pick apart like spots"
