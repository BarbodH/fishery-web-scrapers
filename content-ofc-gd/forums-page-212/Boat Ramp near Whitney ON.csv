874951,Can_38,2014-10-01 19:10:00,152,I'll be visiting family just off #127 (MacKenzie Rd) next week and contemplating on bring the boat to get a few hours in on the Saturday morning.  Suggested lake to launch a 16'er preferably to fish smb / lmb but other species are welcome?
875026,Dozer,2014-10-01 23:53:00,896,"Bark Lake is about 30 minutes east of there.  I'm sure there are lakes closer with launches however I do suspect that the launches will be unmaintained ""bush"" launches so be prepared to get your feet wet.  Best of luck - maybe speak to a local at the local watering hole?"
875230,Dutch01,2014-10-03 16:09:00,1431,Bark Lake has absolutely massive walleye - I have seen plenty of 10+ pound fish come from there.  You'll need good electronics though.  The lake is huge and deep.
875249,jimmer,2014-10-03 19:23:00,2730,"Go to Hay Lake. I love Bark Lake, but not an easy lake to fish for just a day. Hay has some good smallies in it."
