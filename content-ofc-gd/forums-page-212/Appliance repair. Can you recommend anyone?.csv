It just began to make a squeezing noise and died, sounds like the motor was revving up and down / the drum was speeding up and slowing down.  I should add it has all digital controls and the controls are in working order.  Can anyone one recommend a kenmore technician in the belleville Trenton area?  I'm going to tear the back off it now to see if I can locate something obvious.  Thanks in advance,  G"

A service call is likely going to cost you close to $100.00 + parts etc..  My washing machine went a couple of months ago, a Maytag that had been repaired once already and was a least 10 years old. After looking around on line, and some sticker shock? I went with a Hotpoint from Home Depot too, it had been a while since I heard that brand name.  It's simple and non digital, the price was right, and the costs to repair it if it needs them will probably be lower too."
