874811,Mister G,2014-09-30 22:49:00,1429,"If you're NOT using some form of fuel stabilizer/ethanol treatment...You're doing it wrong! I agree with using a stabilizer for storage purposes but don't see a need for a ethanol treatment, especially if you have a engine that has been designed around fuel that contains 10% alcohol."
874865,blue pickeral,2014-10-01 09:37:00,267,"You can make your own - 1/3 kerosene, 1/3 isopropyl alcohol, 1/3 naptha gas. Check the WHIMS sheets."
874964,MrSimon,2014-10-01 19:30:00,217,Someone mentioned a 50/50 mix of gas and Seafoam.  Will that even work?  Will the motor run an such a high percentage of Seafoam?
875008,davey buoy,2014-10-01 22:35:00,5505,"I like to follow the directions,looks like it's a concentrated formula. Most likely not good in greater amounts."
875052,Sinker,2014-10-02 03:13:00,8692,"50/50 seems a little rich to me, but I will run a full can in 25l of gas late in the fall to clean everything out real good before winter.  S."
875069,DanD,2014-10-02 12:34:00,2223,"If anyone in the London area is interested, I've got the 16oz cans of SeaFoam here at the shop. Members of the board can have it at my cost of $8.00 tax in; I regularly sell it for $14.85 plus tax. I'm not making anything on it; just thought I'd throw it out there for you guys. Let me know 519-681-3844  Dan."
875070,BillM,2014-10-02 12:37:00,17367,Great offer Dan!
875084,bigbuck,2014-10-02 13:39:00,2449,"Ethanol for all the bad it does also does goo too. It is a solvent and actually helps to clean out the fuel system and carb and or injectors. It works wonders for two strokes but for four strokes, I would only use it sparingly. BUT definitely add a fuel treatment at the end of the season for all your power equipment and run it for a few minutes to get it through the fuel system. Something be it Seafoam, Stabil or whatever else strikes your fancy is better than nothing at all."
875087,DanD,2014-10-02 13:49:00,2223,"For all the 4 stroke owners, seafoam can also be used in the crankcase. I've had it help with noisy/dirty lifters; just by the cleaning it does. Follow the directions; more is not always better.  Dan."
875092,nancur373,2014-10-02 14:35:00,1211,For those not in the London area I just bought a bottle at Carquest. It's on sale for 9.69 for a 473ml bottle.
875094,lookinforwalleye,2014-10-02 14:46:00,4399,Can this stuff be used on a Optimax??
875099,nancur373,2014-10-02 15:09:00,1211,Can this stuff be used on a Optimax?? apparently any engine gas or diesel. I was also told to fill my diesel fuel filter with it next time I change it to clean the top end
875101,BillM,2014-10-02 15:45:00,17367,"apparently any engine gas or diesel. I was also told to fill my diesel fuel filter with it next time I change it to clean the top end  I wouldn't be doing this.  If you want something diesel specific, I'd be using Diesel Purge."
873979,Regan Thompson,2014-09-25 04:55:00,80,"I don't normally preach a product but in this case (it's so good!) I have no choice...  Case study:  We had 6 outboard, 9.9 engines out of service at our lodge (thought I was going to have to take them to my mechanic $$$$)"
873980,Joeytier,2014-09-25 06:46:00,3990,Yes everyone should learn to love the foam...doesnt do much for lower ends unfortunately
873981,fishindevil,2014-09-25 07:27:00,6254,Seafoam is awesome and I use all their products and have for years !!!! It works in everything including my snowmobile snowblower weedeater you name it !!!!! It's great stuff and regularly run it in my 50hp Yamaha four stroke outboard !!!! It was just on sale in Canadian tire this week for $10.99 a can !!!!
873988,Rich Clemens,2014-09-25 09:44:00,3131,OUCH.
873994,fisherman7,2014-09-25 11:44:00,325,"I use it for various uses in my outboard, snow blower, weed eater, lawn mower, etc........... and if it wasn't for being on this board, I would have never known about it. Love this board!!!"
874012,bigbuck,2014-09-25 14:02:00,2449,Great stuff esp for two strokes. It us a better cleaner than stabilizer though.

I use Stabil every 3rd tank  or so.
874043,Roe Bag,2014-09-25 16:44:00,246,"I use it for various uses in my outboard, snow blower, weed eater, lawn mower, etc........... X2  Outboard, lawnmower, snowblower, weed eater and chainsaw every time I have to refill a container. Five ounces in my 25 litre outboard tank. (usually only once a season) Three ounces for a 10 litre can. (lawnmower/snowblower) Couple of ounces in my five litre cans for my weed eater and chainsaw. Usually dump in a whole can in each my vehicles gas tanks when I change my oil and filter. Keeps everything purring like a kitten.  I stock up when CTC puts it on sale. Always keep a couple of cans on hand."
874053,wallyboss,2014-09-25 17:31:00,1095,Last Summer I waited til i had 1/4 tank left in my 2007 Ram and poured a full can in it. The next week my fuel consumption went down at least 20%. And a lot peppier(spelling??)
874060,davey buoy,2014-09-25 19:44:00,5505,"So for my I/O,this Sunday is it.I usually flog,add the red stabilizer(wrong kind,but it is a V8). Does the sea foam comes in a liquid version?,and will it last like 6-8 months through the tank?,Great thread,sorry to hi jack a bit.Would like to add something before Sundays run.Thanks."
874063,floater,2014-09-25 20:27:00,220,Napa has it on sale at 8.99 a can and if you buy two they give you a third for free. This was on monday this week. Great stuff.
874066,davey buoy,2014-09-25 20:33:00,5505,Napa has it on sale at 8.99 a can and if you buy two they give you a third for free. This was on monday this week. Great stuff. Is that liquid or spray?
874079,aplumma,2014-09-25 21:20:00,6896,"Regan as for the dewinterizing process make sure to use the Seafoam liquid additive in the gas tanks every tank or two. The spray is good for the air passages but it is the liquid that will clean the floats, seats and needles of the carburetor.   Art"
874083,Sinker,2014-09-25 21:51:00,8692,"Yes, it comes in a liquid. Thats all I use. Napa still has the sale going, I bought a case. I use it as a stabilizer in every tank of gas I put in the boat. Great stuff for sure, I use it on all my 2 stroke equipment, and most 4 strokes too. Awesome in my weed eater and chainsaws.  S."
874114,fishindevil,2014-09-26 08:13:00,6254,
874242,Wagoneer,2014-09-27 05:17:00,118,It's a fantastic solution for 2 stroke motors. Only issue is if you use it too often it'll eventually eat away at the HG or dislodge something from it thags actually helping to seal it.
874331,danc,2014-09-28 03:05:00,4677,"Big Seafoam addict here too. It goes into all of my piston driven possessions regularly. And you can't use too much either. Every spring I run a 50/50 solution through my 2001 60 merc and it's run like a sewing machine ever since. Never have I added fuel stabilizer, and my off season is 8 months long."
874332,danc,2014-09-28 03:15:00,4677,Napa has it on sale at 8.99 a can and if you buy two they give you a third for free. This was on monday this week. Great stuff. My local NAPA always has it for 8.99 a can. About 5 bucks a can cheaper than Canadian Tire.
874443,AdamS,2014-09-28 21:51:00,161,I've heard of sea foam but never tried it yet and I've got a 2 stroke..I'm gonna have to look into this..which product specifically do you guys use?
874448,Joeytier,2014-09-28 22:06:00,3990,"Spray is good for winterizing/summerizing carbs and plugs, and the liquid is good for pouring straight into your gas tanks.  Just curious, why do some of you run stabil in their tanks while you're still going thru gas?  The only thing that comes to mind is ethanol treatment?"
874455,Pigeontroller,2014-09-28 23:01:00,2793,If you're NOT using some form of fuel stabilizer/ethanol treatment...You're doing it wrong!
874558,nancur373,2014-09-29 18:00:00,1211,Shell premium (0 ethanol) in everything. Stabilizer and fog in the off season.
874646,moxie,2014-09-29 23:47:00,1566,Been using it for a couple of seasons and swear by it. One can every 2-3 tanks of gas.
874655,Raf,2014-09-30 01:27:00,3495,"If you're NOT using some form of fuel stabilizer/ethanol treatment...You're doing it wrong!  or you have a portable tank and dump any unused fuel from the boat in the car  i only use stabil to winterize, don't see the point of using it during the summer and havent thought of a reason to use seafoam in my 40 4-stroke.    my motor gets fresh fuel every time out."
874761,Pigeontroller,2014-09-30 19:40:00,2793,  Except for the stuff in your carbs/injectors...
