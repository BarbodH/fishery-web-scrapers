Add in the fact that the fish were on a feeding frenzy, it makes for an amazing outing.  Caught these fish on shallow rocks with tubes, senkos, jerkbaits, crankbaits, it all worked!  Also tightened up on a couple eater sized walleye that made excellent table fare!  Enjoy the pics, and get out there while their hot!    "
