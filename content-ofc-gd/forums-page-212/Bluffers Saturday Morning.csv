874366,Tim Mills,2014-09-28 15:25:00,476,"I went fishing with a guy from Spoonpullers Saturday morning.  We had a good morning hooking fish but catching them was more difficult.  We went landed five and hooked 10 maybe 12.  It was a nice mix of salmon and trout, most of the fish were good sized.  The boat owner has just started using the Smart Troll System.  As many of you know this system uses probes on your riggers or lines that sends depth and temp info to a receiver which then sends it to your cellphone.It was interesting, he likes it but is still working out some bugs.  On the water around 7:00       Started trolling around 325ft. went as deep as 400ft.  Most hits 30-40ft down.    My largest salmon:    Most hits came on the rigger lines with spoons 70ft back,  We did get a couple hits on the dipsey rods as well.  Hot colours were greens and bright colours:     Lets hope we get another weekend or 2 with some more nice weather.  Tight lines to all.                  "

Soft mouths in the pre dawn light and short striking all day. All but 2 of the fish we boated today spat the book in the net."
