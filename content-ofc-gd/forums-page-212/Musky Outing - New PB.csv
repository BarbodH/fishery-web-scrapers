874527,Brettiop,2014-09-29 14:54:00,279,"I was out with 3 buddies yesterday got out about noon, Was really busy out there everyone enjoying a beauty day on the lake.We were casting in a spot we had luck in a few weeks back, about 12 FOW, two of my buddies had a follow each but nothing committed, one may have been a  pike.We moved a little ways and tried an area around 9-7 Fow, i got a nice hit on a Handlebarz Egg head white/green(Cisco), which turned out to be a nice pike. Probably my personal best at 33""With the same lure tied on about 10 minutes later i saw a flash when i did a turn at the side of the boat, thought it was just a small musky, but half way through my figure 8 my rod loaded up and it was on, this fish fought way better then any of my previous fish, and i thought for sure on a couple jumps it would come un-pinned, but we manage to slide it in the Net.A 44"" fatty and my new PB!What a blast, was my first fish Ive ever got to bite on a Figure 8Also got a decent sized gar that wanted a piece of my Tube.Trolled for 1 1/2 hours to end the day, didn't get a rip while trolling.  Unfortunately none of my buddyes hooked up, but they sure want another invite out after seeing a few fish boated... I'm super pumped and just want to get back out there for a bigger one!"
874528,Roy,2014-09-29 15:12:00,13728,Sounds like a super day for you. Congrats on the PBs.

874587,Rich Clemens,2014-09-29 19:08:00,3131,Nice to see some folks are updating their PB this year.   Congrats to ya. Two different species in the same day ...  that don't happen very often.
874588,Brettiop,2014-09-29 19:10:00,279,"Yea thanks Rich, it is quite possibly a 3 PB day, that Gar is likely one too....  Haven't caught many of them recently but i doubt i ever got one that big when i was younger and tried for them often..."
874671,Pigeontroller,2014-09-30 04:45:00,2793,"Nice Fish! Just got in from a 6 fish day on that same Lake! Nothing as nice as that 44"" though!"
874685,outllaw,2014-09-30 11:07:00,1232,nice fish great pics. them muskies fear that mike parker guy eh.
874700,thegrumpyfisherman,2014-09-30 13:05:00,59,Those Gar are aggressive eh?  I love it when I catch a fish that's the same size as the lure it attacked funny stuff.  Nice Musky btw!
874706,Hank Jr,2014-09-30 13:28:00,146,Nice Muskie thanks for the report
874710,Brettiop,2014-09-30 14:27:00,279,"Those Gar are aggressive eh?  I love it when I catch a fish that's the same size as the lure it attacked funny stuff.  Nice Musky btw!  They sure are, we must have seen 200 break the surface that day  I had a monster that had to be 40-45"" following my figure 8 for about 30 seconds that day as well...he wouldn't commit though."
874820,Handlebarz,2014-09-30 23:29:00,3790,Awesome report congrats on the PB not alot of guys using the egg heads but the ones that are have been doing great. Nice gar they are great to watch.
874826,Fisherpete,2014-09-30 23:35:00,1814,Very nice muskie - keep fishing there and it won't be long till you break that PB again!
875166,Regan Thompson,2014-10-03 00:14:00,80,"Nice looking 44"".  I can't believe how different the fish out of there look compared to up here!  Amazing how Muskies camouflage to their settings."
875167,Joeytier,2014-10-03 00:37:00,3990,That's a HEAVY 44.  Nice fish
