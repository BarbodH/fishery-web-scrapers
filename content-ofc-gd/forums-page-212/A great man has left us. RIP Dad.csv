872345,KraTToR,2014-09-13 23:29:00,506,"In March my father was diagnosed with lung, liver and bone cancer at the young age of 75. Saturday Sept 6th at 5am he succumbed to the cancer after it had spread to his heart. He passed just 3 hrs before I was to do my Ride the Rideau 100k cycle to raise funds for the Ottawa Hospital Foundation and their effort to find a cure for cancer. My mother called me at 5:15am to give me the news and she insisted i complete my ride in dedication to my father. With a heavy heart I completed my ride for my dad. Today is his wake, tomorrow his funeral service. I went for a nice long ride this morning to clear some cobwebs before the wake this afternoon.  My Dad: Retired Lt. Col RCAF CAF Angler Birder Jazz fan Photographer Lived for and loved his grandkids Husband to my mom 55 years Awesome father to 3 kids My hero.  Gonna miss you dad  RIP Gary Frederick Clay  CIMG1346 - Version 2.jpeg  http://tubmanfuneralhomes.com/families-care/?id=731  Please support cancer research, it MUST be stopped!! Lost my dad last Xmas, he was 93 and a WW2 vet.  Taught me to fish, hunt, build things, and most of all, be a gentleman.  RIP dad. I think of you often."

874214,muskymatt,2014-09-26 22:58:00,2608,"Thanks guys, I'd be lying if I said it hasn't been tough. Think of my dad many times every day. Taking comfort knowing his suffering is over. It's going to be a year of many firsts, first Thanksgiving without him, Christmas etc. We have a strong family unit though and are working to help each other through it.  Matt"

874467,irishfield,2014-09-29 00:41:00,26272,"So sorry to read this Matt and unfortunately there's no great words that I can put together at this time. Been there and still have the ""program"" unfortunately and mine passed from this miserable disease in 1986 at 59 years of age.  If I can put anything together in type, I can offer this..... it's a good thing you think of him a few times a day... some can just walk away. Those that cared for their parent, no matter the circumstances, can not. I didn't get along well with my father from the time I was about 11 until he died when I was 24 (and by then I already had 2 kids). Maybe it was me, maybe it was him, but the respect was still there deep down. When it came to Grandchildren, and Leah and I marrying at 18 & 20 for that matter, he stood behind it all with pride. There's not a day that goes by that I think of something that I did.. he did or didn't do. Good or bad the memories are all there and they will be for you in regards to your father on a daily basis. Some will make you smile, some will make you cry.... others will just make you ponder on how to be a better man.  Be well.... and PM if you wanna chat. I'm home for the winter by the looks of things. Wayne"

871831,bigbuck,2014-09-10 22:46:00,2449,Sorry to hear about your loss. The loss of a parent is a tough pill to swallow. His pain and suffering is over. He can rest now and it is time for your family to heal. Spend time with your mother and give her a lot of love. That is what you need.

We lost him last summer. His health was not a good situation for the last 10 years. It took me a while but I am happy now he is not suffering. I'd love to have him back.  I found recalling and even discussing at times the memories with close family and friends helped."
871872,muskymatt,2014-09-11 01:33:00,2608,"Thank you everyone so much for all the kind words. It's been a whirlwind of emotions for the last while but tomorrow we will honor him with a good service and then start another chapter in our lives. It was humbling to see so many come out to the wake today. Taking time together as a family to start the healing process has been a big help to all of us, he did well in giving us that quality.  Thanks again"
871904,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-11 06:01:00,8243,"Our deepest condolences Matt. I has to be very tough to loose Dad. I almost take for granted that my Pa is 87 and still as healthy as someone 20 years his journey. I am about the only person in our group that can still pick up the phone and call him or stop by. I think we'll do that tomorrow. A very touching tribute making the ride for Dad. Stay strong, Mom needs you now more than ever."
