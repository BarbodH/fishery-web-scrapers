874982,misfish,2014-10-01 20:27:00,29133,Dusted mine off 3 weeks ago.  Got 4 days off coming up to do some searching.

875058,misfish,2014-10-02 10:06:00,29133,Thats is very purdy. Thats what Im talking about.
875062,davey buoy,2014-10-02 11:07:00,5505,Great pics!!looks like I'm running a bit late?lol.Time for catch up!!
875065,BillM,2014-10-02 11:53:00,17367,"I wouldn't have your heart set on river fishing this weekend, the 20mms of rain on Friday will turn the river you're going to fish into chocolate milk.   If you can, get out before that."
875081,misfish,2014-10-02 13:35:00,29133,Im going west.
875097,BillM,2014-10-02 14:56:00,17367,"Im going west.  I hope you're going to BC cause with the rain we've got in the forecast, there isn't much that's going to be fishable.  15mm on Friday with 45km/h winds, another 15mm on Sat with 45km/h winds.  Going to be a wet/windy weekend in Southern Ontario."
875104,Brettiop,2014-10-02 15:57:00,279,"I like the forecast I'm seeing a lot better then yours,  Where are you seeing that forecast Bill?"
875106,BillM,2014-10-02 16:24:00,17367,"I like the forecast I'm seeing a lot better then yours,  Where are you seeing that forecast Bill?  The Weather Network."
875108,Brettiop,2014-10-02 16:34:00,279,"I guess I'm looking at the forecast a few hours south of you....not expecting as much down here,"
875109,BillM,2014-10-02 16:38:00,17367,"A few hours south?  Like NY? lol  Even Toronto is expected to get 15mm + on Sat.  The rain isn't a huge deal if you can get out early, but the wind is the crappy part especially if you're exposed."
875113,Brettiop,2014-10-02 16:45:00,279,"No like Chatham area lol...  I agree not many steelie rivers are going to be in good shape come Saturday afternoon or so.  No Steelhead rivers down this way so wasn't wondering because of that, just curious which forecast was showing that much rain, because it will effect both my goose hunting plans on sat, and musky fishing plans on sunday haha..."
875114,BillM,2014-10-02 16:49:00,17367,Well I hope it changes for ya!  It's not like the weathermen are ever right  :)     Goodluck!
