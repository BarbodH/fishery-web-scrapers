874360,davew3,2014-09-28 14:12:00,430,Nice job.  There is a bunch of fish frys.   I saw the perchers out there but didn't want to go near them.  I may next time.  Regards

874504,BillM,2014-09-29 10:32:00,17367,"Doug, I think we need to change your title to 'walleye slayer'!!!  Great job man!   We gotta get that boat out on the Niagara this fall for some steel!"
874507,creditmaster,2014-09-29 10:43:00,190,wow nice wallye
874508,mattyk,2014-09-29 10:45:00,2110,Nice fish Doug!
874513,RickOnt,2014-09-29 13:05:00,669,"Doug  You have those Erie Walleye dialed in, For sure!  Another great catch"
874515,Terry,2014-09-29 13:11:00,14456,nice catch

874692,ch312,2014-09-30 12:41:00,1590,"wow nice wallye  Not to take anything away from these great fish and report, but those are just your average Erie eyes. Many people don't realize that an Erie average size fish is a monster trophy in many other waters.  Congrats on the great day! Were you fishing near bottom? I haven't fished for them at this time of year and was wondering where they'd be in the water column right now.    And to think some people already have their boats in storage..."
874696,thegrumpyfisherman,2014-09-30 12:49:00,59,"I would love to have a boat big enough to do Erie!  Awesome fish, though I gotta say that unhealthy yellowish/white colouring to them down there makes me wonder whats in them sometimes lol.  Still prefer the dark green of up North."

And to think some people already have their boats in storage... i never said they were giant eye's but the one on the left was 29 and a half inch's my boat has over 500 walleye's in it this year and only 3 over 30inch i think it's better then average.50ft down over 73ft ."
