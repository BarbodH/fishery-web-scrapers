874230,BillM,2014-09-27 02:22:00,17367,Minnow spinnerbait?   You sure you don't mean a inline spinner with one of those plastic minnows on the end of the hook?    Spinners and spoons are killer for steelhead.
874231,Steelheadphycho,2014-09-27 02:28:00,470,"Oh YA! One of my favorite spinning gear baits is pink/blue vibrix spinners. Or even the headen brands do well. I use them in the south shore tribs of Lake Erie and while surf fishing the mouths of some ""select"" creeks.  Spinners are a great choice with the chrome!"
874232,creditmaster,2014-09-27 02:30:00,190,nope like a spinner bait
874234,creditmaster,2014-09-27 02:33:00,190,bill?
874236,BillM,2014-09-27 02:51:00,17367,If it's flashy they'll eat it
874238,creditmaster,2014-09-27 02:52:00,190,ok it was crazy 15 foot hole i dropper it in let it sink cranked it to the top and BLAM street fight
874243,Bondar,2014-09-27 05:53:00,817,"Baits are made to look like food, fish like food. The species specific labels are more for catching fisherman I think. Trout will eat just about anything"
874244,OhioFisherman,2014-09-27 07:44:00,6623,"Spinner baits, whether in line or safety pin style seem to be designed to imitate bait fish. This time of year Steelhead and other species seem to be gourging on them, they might hit anything that resembles a bait fish?  I have caught them on tubes, small crankbaits, and jig and grubs, in Lake Erie and it's tribs in the fall fishing for smallies. My biggest walleye came on a safety pin style spinner bait on the georgian bay, the very next cast I caught a 12 - 13 inch Crappie on the same lure, they are versatile lures."

874318,Tim Mills,2014-09-28 01:57:00,476,Don't forget to upgrade the spinner bait hooks for the steelhead.  I hear eBay has some good deals on hooks.
874319,creditmaster,2014-09-28 01:58:00,190,yup
874487,spinnerdoc,2014-09-29 02:11:00,556,"The hits are like freight train running away with your spinner  Tight line, savage hit...can't beat that"
874491,MJL,2014-09-29 02:37:00,2427,"Back in the day when the trout hatchery at Frenchman's bay was still operating, I saw a guy land a 6lb steelhead on a buzzbait (I also seen carp caught on buzz-baits there as well but that's another story.LOL). In winter, the area around the bridge would remain ice free and the one angler was fishing for pike trying everything from Spinnerbaits, rapalas, in-line spinners, soft-plastics and buzz-baits. The only fish that I saw caught that day was that steelhead on the buzz-bait. It blew my mind.LOL"
