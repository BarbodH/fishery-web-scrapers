They state they are perfect for deep cycle batteries...  I know that I cannot expect the  solar panel to charge the battery from a dead state.... but would it work to keep the batteries ""topped"" up? states it is 1.8 watts.  Anyone have one of these units? and does it keep your batteries conditioned?  G"
166432,irishfield,2008-03-02 00:55:00,26272,Not when you park the rig inside bud!  Yes they work to keep it fresh... too small to charge anything other than the last few percent though.
166436,Terry,2008-03-02 01:08:00,14456,1.8 w 12 volts = .15 amps  so if you have a 150 amp batteries  it would take 1000 hours to charge it up and that's 1000 hours at max sun light....not much value  but hey only 100 hours to raise the battery up 15 amps  again that sunlight hours

166449,Bernie,2008-03-02 02:06:00,3190,We use one at our hunt camp to keep the generator battery charged. Works great! Keeps them from freezing in the periods in between visits. Also good for vehicles sitting for a month or two without being driven.
166485,Guest lundboy,2008-03-02 04:44:00,0, You could get a 100 of them and put them in parallel.  Should speed up the charging.

166589,Terry,2008-03-02 16:20:00,14456,if you went with one of these for 99 bucks it would work at almost 10x more watts  http://www.canadiantire.ca/browse/product_...fromSearch=true
