166489,Sandbag,2008-03-02 05:04:00,533,How was the shoreline access at St. Williams Rich? Is it getting beat up or still holding together?  Cheers  Craig
166498,Rich,2008-03-02 05:15:00,3927,"Shoreline access still okay, no open spots anyway. Lots of sleds and quads out on the north side of the bay. Apparently closer to the south side of the bay the ice is thinner as a guy on the ice told us some guy went through earlier in the week over there. Where we were was 10 - 18 inches of ice. Just stay by the huts and the road more travelled. Don't have to go far to get fish right now, plenty in 6-7 feet of water."
166506,Ramble,2008-03-02 05:42:00,713,"I love perch too, just ate the last of them last night actually.  -R-"
166522,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-02 12:08:00,1183,Love the little trophy fish.  Ya...a man's meal with the remote to boot.
166532,Greencoachdog,2008-03-02 12:48:00,8163,"Great Pics and entertaing report Rich!!!  The next time you have the Weasel Whiz and Chakkin Wieners together like that, dump a couple bottles of the weasel whiz in a pot and boil your wieners in it... much better than burning them in the fry pan.  That particular brand of weasel whiz goes very well with raw oysters!"

166559,huey graphite,2008-03-02 14:31:00,362,mmmmmmm....perch filtes!  Nice catch and humerous report as always!
166727,Rich,2008-03-02 22:23:00,3927,"Well I was back out today with my boss from work and no pictures to share we only got 6 keepers in 3 hours and were forced to pack it up. Was beautiful out there today though, no wind. No survival suit necessary just my fleece pants and winter jacket. 'Course the slight hangover from last night's festivities made me a bit sluggish on the hooksets but I still had fun and brought a bit home for the frying pan. Hopefully this ice will be gone soon and I can cast a line for pike."
166855,huey graphite,2008-03-03 03:25:00,362,Great pics by the way. Make me realize I work too much!
