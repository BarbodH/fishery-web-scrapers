166581,carp-starter,2008-03-02 15:49:00,253,"Irishfield, the last time the Leafs won the Stanley Cup was in 1967. Since then, POOOF, nothing. 1993 was the year when the Montreal Habs won the cup the last time.  ChrisS, the Habs have nothing to worry from the red hot “Bruins”. They are not much better than the leafs – the last time the Bruins won the Cup the last time was in 1972.  I am Canadian and I have reached that part of the year where I do not care who wins the Cup – but as long as it is a Canadian team. MUST BE a CANADIAN TEAM.  Go Canada Go  Carp-starter"
