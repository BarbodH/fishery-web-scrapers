166459,camillj,2008-03-02 03:01:00,1988,Site could definitely use an facelift ... the store on the other hand is on my weekend rounds along with CT and Home Depot  ... I consider it a part of my saturday (if Im not on the water) ... always friendly and often special order stuff I ask for ... follow up with calls to me when stuff comes in ... the BPS on the other hand have driven many miles only to find the catalogue special item I came for is sold out - try to sell me something else and no interest in getting to come back by special ordering for me ... to each his own ... but I have always thought LeB was THE fishing store for me and much more personal.
166468,bassslinger,2008-03-02 03:26:00,21,"The dot com / e tail business isn`t what Lebaron is about. They started as retailers and continue to compete with that as a priority. Not only are their reels sell cheaper, lures, rods, terminal tackle and supplies are aswell. You can't judge a retail company by it`s online sevices. It`s a different business. How many rods or reels would you buy online without feeling them in your hands first?. You will save plenty of cash taking advantage of the no tax sales Lebaron provide a few times a year. If I have a choice of spending 200 bucks on a reel at Lebaron or BPS. I would rather keep the money in Canada."
166478,Want,2008-03-02 03:50:00,39,"I've been a customer at the Mississauga store since they opened. Yep, the website and pdf's are dated. But as been said, I think they are first a brick and mortar retailer, and a online vendor as a distance second.'  I noticed over the past couple of years  that they've improved the customer service in the store and that's good to see. I see BPS as being more Bass fishing oriented than LB.  I think LB also suffers from a lack of rod mfr. choices as well as some mainline American Bass lure mfrs. I know they've tried to bring in St. Croix but couldn't.  All in all I sure wouldn't want to see LB go out of business."
166508,Hooked,2008-03-02 05:52:00,891," I'm totally confused here holdfast.  Rick designs websites on the side, so I wasn't being weak and asking for this thread to be deleted. On another note, I don't think their website sucks, just think it could be better."
166526,Chris,2008-03-02 12:30:00,405,"Hi, most Canadian companies have poor customer service compared to their U.S. counterparts (been shopping in the US lately....the difference is VERY noticeable).   I'm tired of dealing with Canadian retailers whose staff actually seem perturbed about having to serve someone. However, other than crappy service, I have always found what I want at LeBarons and their prices are pretty good. You can also sign up for their card for savings at the till.  There is a small ""mom and pop"" fishing store in Winchester (middle of nowhere) called Paddletales. Ed the owner told me that his sales tripled immediately after offering services online. Those who feel that going cheap on the website is the reason they can sell for less, better rethink that one. What's it cost for a website.....less than a few grand to set up and a few hundred a year to maintain. I don't think that kind of chump change would equate to savings at the till. Especially with triple the revenues.  I know for a fact that Ed at Paddletales will go out of his way to make his customers happy   ......see if you will get that at Lebarons or BPS."
166633,PatrickGG,2008-03-02 17:25:00,562,"Le Baron: Canadian BPS and Cabelas: American  I go to Le Baron alot and i found they have two workers whom i look for when shopping there and they give me lots of advice and are very helpful i guess thats a perk since i am a Reg there but on the other hand if you wanna spend time shopping on-line and waiting a few days just cause you dont want to get off your butt and find a good deal thats your prerogative, I gear myself towards a Canadian established business BUT don't get me wrong If i see a sale or a bargain i will get up and snatch it...  Thats just my opinion."
166766,sirfish,2008-03-03 00:11:00,175,Word has it that Lebaron has been bought out by one of the big guys. Time will tell
166768,Raf,2008-03-03 00:13:00,3495,"being local to LeB, I'll sacrifice the glamour and glitz of a fancy website/catalog for lower overhead and lower prices."
166885,snag,2008-03-03 05:31:00,1932,"I have shopped Lebarons since 1979.  Companies evolve.  In the last 3 years, prices and service have been.....  Good.  I wouldn't waste the gas on BPS otherwise. I still go there for ""sales"" but as pointed out, they are more expensive.  (just wait till Cabelas attacks)"
166933,fishinggeek,2008-03-03 14:13:00,325,"Yes cheap prices are what make me a loyal Le Baron customer!  But for a few items that could be found cheaper at other places, I gladly go there.  And BPS is convenient to window shop when I'm otherwise shopping at the mall, but I almost never buy anything there.  I usually bring my Le Baron catalogue with me when I go to other tackle shops to compare prices.  I would take lower prices over service anyday.  I don't need anyone to chat about fishing with, or even friendly, smiling faces.  You can call me names for all I care as long as I'm paying the lowest price!"
166343,forrest,2008-03-01 21:13:00,1032,"I have had good experiences in LeBarons.  The staff were very knowledgeable and they were friendly. Prices on tackle was reasonable...some prices were high, but I got some good deals too.  I would shop there again.   The website....well it is hard to navigate and could easily be updated for little money (I am in the know).  Would improving it help the business?  I don't know, thats a business decision.   forrest"
166347,bassfighter,2008-03-01 21:23:00,366,"Most Canadians of 50+ years old generation do not shop on line, therefore the owner might assume online catalogue is not that important.  I have been selling on line since 1995, mostly to Americans. It is only within the past 4 years, that most of my potential Canadian customer will look at our web catalogue, they would still prefer to shop at our physical store in toronto.  Americans are even more competitive lately due to potential recession, Cabelas and Bass pro are competing against each other heavily for on line shopping business.  Their on line price can be cheaper at times, except for their shipping cost to Canada. I get both of their one line sale weekly and the way they bombard me with their Ads, it is hard not to be tempted to buy things there.  Lebarons catalogue is helpful enough, though quite primitive compared to their Bass Pro. However, for the basic things, they still have good deals ."
166349,irishfield,2008-03-01 21:25:00,26272,"Website and on-line ordering format suck... but obviously not a priority to them to stay in business.  As for service in the store... can't remember the last time I had to ask for something in a tackle shop. Don't you all just browse, grab and buy? Seriously... had no problem with service either in 1983, when I bought my Lebaron Special (Berkley lightning rod in black) and MAG II baitcaster that I still use, or in 2005/6/7. In 2005 I had great help picking out my downrigging rods/reels (that I'm still happy with) and even being told to be sure I bought a membership first before checking out with the rods/reels and two downriggers!  In all my days of wondering BPS... since it's opened.. I've only had a single occasion where a sales associate asked me if there was something they could help me with... and that was Jackie Chan !"
166371,Corey,2008-03-01 22:34:00,355,I just browse through the catalogue and go there if I want something.
166423,Canuck2fan,2008-03-02 00:17:00,1444,"YES their site is old tech and pain at times to find just what you want. That being said if it saves me 20 to 30% over Cabelas or BPS when I have to order online I can handle a little work..... Also no PST is a big plus and no OUTRAGEOUS brokerage/handling charges like the other two.  In the store I have had MUCH better service at Lebaron's than I have ever had at BPS in Vaughn.... I am more likely to pick out what I want in either store though, so I don't really care what the staff acts like for the one or two times a year I need their help."
