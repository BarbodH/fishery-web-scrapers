I brought out my good friends brother for his second time and he nailed a monster (14.4). We didn""t get the numbers that we usually do but all the fish caught were over 6 lbs. All fish were released.... Heading up on Friday for the last dance with mother Walleye... I hope there will be lots of pics to post....                            "
