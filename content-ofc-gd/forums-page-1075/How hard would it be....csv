I started a new job in August and my vacation got a little massaging this year so I will only be taking 2 weeks between know and September...  Our company closes for an additional 2 weeks between Xmas and the week after New Years.....long story short, my wife and I have been wanting to fish the |Chapleau are in the winter, we thought it might be nice to go with a small group instead of by ourselves, would there be an interest here? A snowmobile or at least a rental for the week is a must."
