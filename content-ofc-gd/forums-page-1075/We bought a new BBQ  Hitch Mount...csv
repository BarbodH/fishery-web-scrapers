I think It will interfere with my turning abilities I've bought a 2"" bolt on receiver that I can clamp on to my class III   .....I need to dig my boat out of the snowbank to actually see the outcome.  I'm thinking of bolting the BBQ mount on my boat trailer...If it has to come to that."
166652,Clampet,2008-03-02 18:06:00,1947,Wow what a set-up! 
166656,Radnine,2008-03-02 18:18:00,1538,"That will be great, you can clean the barbie when you launch your boat!"
166669,irishfield,2008-03-02 19:22:00,26272,You've travelled our roads... correct!?
166673,lickmyarmpit,2008-03-02 19:57:00,359,now all you need is one of these. www.bumperdumper.com
166675,bowshep,2008-03-02 20:06:00,378,Set up a mount on the boat trailer it should tuck under the bow and not limit the turning radius because it will be centred... May be...  Nice set up.   Ken
166676,Muskieman,2008-03-02 20:18:00,2472, I'm thinkin that thats I'll have to do it..
166678,Muskieman,2008-03-02 20:22:00,2472,  Oh yes!!    they're quite rough.... but this thing is guaranteed for  3yrs or 36.000 miles.  but i wonder if that covers falling off the truck and getting run over due to rough roads.  I imagine when I get all set up I'll look like the Grizwalds from the Vacation movie...I wonder if I should put my mother-in-law on the roof in her rocker?
166750,silveradosheriff,2008-03-02 23:44:00,1025,One word.....SWEET!
