166601,Tootsie II,2008-03-02 16:47:00,162,"Just for your info, a part time medical records clerk picked a Timmy's at the outlet on the lower level of our hospital of Wednesday and ""Bingo"" a new Toyota. Also when I read the Timmins Daily Press website yesterday, apparently someone up there also picked up a Toyata. That's 2 gone. I'll win when the Leafs win the Stanley Cup. That means probably not in my lifetime!"

165473,ricoboxing,2008-02-28 12:38:00,398," Nope, I heard they got a few winners before.    about 41 years ago.    I wonder if I'll ever live to see the leafs win a cup. I'm 30 years old and I expect to live till 84.  I doubt it."
165476,wallyboss,2008-02-28 12:48:00,1095,Well I am doing pretty good this year.  I am at 8 out of 10 since Monday.  But just coffees and donuts so far.

165483,BillM,2008-02-28 13:13:00,17367, Add me to that list...  I always buy XL's...  Perhaps I should start buying L's...
165503,blaque,2008-02-28 14:10:00,2419,Buy two smalls instead of an extra large.
165504,nofrills,2008-02-28 14:12:00,89,Lucky guy! This is all I keep getting  
165553,Photoz,2008-02-28 16:30:00,792,I find the freebees in the 'RRRRRRROLL UP THE RRRRRRRIM' contest to be equivalent to about the same amount of prizes as my PETROPOINTS card has gotten me .  .  .   .      in over 20 years I've got 1000 lousy Petro points ONCE . . . . .     a carwash costs about 7000!!
165564,Badger Shark,2008-02-28 16:52:00,291,"Last time there was roll up to win, I didnt open any of the cups until they were done giving them out.  I had 80 cups and out of those 80 I had 7 winning cups, 4 doghnuts and 3 coffe!  Somone told me that xl cups dont have many winners, I guess they were right.  My cousin buys large and wins all the time!  This is unfare, I spend more money for less of a chance!  Oh well as long as I get my order made right, thats a win right there since it seems to be the same odds!"
165568,shane,2008-02-28 17:00:00,652,  You're a genius!  I'm going out right now!
165577,young_one,2008-02-28 17:27:00,620,"On the subject, I just found this off redflagdeals.com ******** Here's a clever little freebie from Country Style, the Ontario coffee chain: March 3-9, bring in a losing Tim Horton's Roll Up The Rim cup and get a free medium coffee.  Now, finally, every cup of Tim Horton's will be a Roll Up The Rim Winner -- whether it's a winner at Tim Horton's or the Coffee Style down the street. ******** MORE COFFEE!"
