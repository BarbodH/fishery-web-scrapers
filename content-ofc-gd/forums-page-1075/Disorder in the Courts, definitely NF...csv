WITNESS: No, this is how I dress when I go to work. ______________________________________ ATTORNEY: Doctor, how many of your autopsies have you performed on dead people?

What school did you go to? WITNESS: Oral. ______________________________________ ATTORNEY: Do you recall the time that you examined the body? WITNESS: The autopsy started around 8:30 p.m. ATTORNEY: And Mr. Denton was dead at the time? WITNESS: No, he was sitting on the table wondering why I was doing an autopsy on him! ____________________________________________ ATTORNEY: Are you qualified to give a urine sample? WITNESS: Huh....are you qualified to ask that  question? ______________________________________ --- And the best for last: --- ATTORNEY: Doctor, before you performed the autopsy, did you check for a pulse? WITNESS: No. ATTORNEY: Did you check for blood pressure? WITNESS: No. ATTORNEY: Did you check for breathing? WITNESS: No. ATTORNEY: So, then it is possible that the patient was alive when you began the autopsy? WITNESS: No. ATTORNEY: How can you be so sure, Doctor? WITNESS: Because his brain was sitting on my desk in a jar. ATTORNEY: I see, but could the patient have still been alive, nevertheless? WITNESS: Yes, it is possible that he could have been alive and practicing law."

167059,Kirk,2008-03-03 18:54:00,347,"for the record...those were ""American"" courts not Canadian LOL  I find those funny but hard to believe  and Oral is pretty common: I've used the 'oral' line before...witnesses shake heads or nod for yes or no, court reporter can't record answer in written transcripts as a yes or no.  I'm working on defences for the rest of those gems"
167121,OhioFisherman,2008-03-03 22:19:00,6623,"I have been in a court room here before, I believe them! Glad I don`t do jury duty now.  Some of the things I have heard from doctors tends to make me avoid them also."
