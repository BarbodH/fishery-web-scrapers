166998,largemouth,2008-03-03 16:55:00,112, well said!
166999,danbo,2008-03-03 17:02:00,2646,Yo Irish..
167007,bbog,2008-03-03 17:12:00,665,"Your buddy knowingly has an item that was not sold or ""given"" to him - clearly a definition of THEFT!  What he chooses to do now is a definition of his CHARACTER. Since most of us have character flaws of one type or another - only the individual can decide what he/she is comfortable with.  Conducting a poll in the hopes that many have this same character flaw does not change the moral, ethical and legal truths. And that is, your buddy is in the possession of stolen merchandise.  How would this story change if you were the party out the inventory or proper compensation?"
167010,Stoty,2008-03-03 17:13:00,2910,"agreed, well said Walleyejigger"
167029,Roy,2008-03-03 17:44:00,13728,I don't believe in karma but I would NEVER jump in a stolen 'chute'.

167034,LeXXington,2008-03-03 17:58:00,1928,"Oh, If you got out without the buzzer going off it must have been a goof buy the cashier, Cause they would have removed the Shop lifting tag..  Its your call,  guilt is a feeling that your can't transfer, or trade.. No guilty feeling your free and clear..  You have guilt take it back"
167044,Spiel,2008-03-03 18:20:00,9065,"....While I don't think any opinions were truly needed in order to your make decision you've certainly elicited many. Time to make a decision, I know I have."
166925,bushart,2008-03-03 13:53:00,2628,Personally I'd take the high road back to LeBarons and pay...the voice in your head can be the most critical of your actions.  One point I have not seen in this thread that there is young anglers who read this board---I would like to think our generation may be able to set the proper example to set them on their way....Heaven know there is enough negative things to distract them already.  Just a thought.  Bushart
166934,brifishrgy,2008-03-03 14:17:00,559,If the cashier missed the item thats their fault .. I would keep it and stock up on some more lures
166936,shane,2008-03-03 14:23:00,652, That's a good point Bushart.  I wonder what people would say if one of their kids came to them with the same problem.  And watch out for Moosebunk's karma pickle!  Karma works in mysterious ways.
166937,Headhunter,2008-03-03 14:29:00,5703,"I'd return it to BPS and get my money back!   Or, I'd take it to BPS and get them to price match it, then take it back to LB's and get them to price match it and so on, until I had accumulated enough funds to retire! Seriously, I'd take it back. HH"

166942,lew,2008-03-03 14:44:00,12767,"Buddy & I were walking up to a hotdog cart for lunch one day when I spotted a $5 bill laying on the ground right in front of the cart. I picked it up with full intention of giving it back to the lady who owned the cart, but as soon as she saw me grab it, she practically screamed at me to give back HER money  I asked how she knew it was hers and not dropped by the last customer and again she screamed at me to return HER money.  She never got the cash, and buddy & I both got free hot dogs at the next cart with our newly found loot. Somehow they tasted much better that day.  Karma goes both ways."
166945,Beans,2008-03-03 14:45:00,3339,What does the guy in the mirror say ???  You are your own judge and jury...  You're the guy you got to live with...
166948,Stoty,2008-03-03 15:02:00,2910," Ha ha ha, thats not even close to the same thing. We are talking about a store that makes millions of dollars a year. They arent going to miss a vest. Plus, if they trained their staff right in the first place, they wouldnt have this problem.  We all spend so much money at stores like this, so its nice to get something in return for once.  Enjoy the free stuff!"
166957,irishfield,2008-03-03 15:25:00,26272,Sorry Stoty... but there's a big difference between selling millions a year (if LB's even hits that mark) and making millions a year.  If nothing else... this thread may have helped us know whether we can leave our gear in our boats at various gatherings!
166958,Stoty,2008-03-03 15:28:00,2910,"Oh, I thought we were talking about BPS.   1) He didn't steal anything. It was the cashiers error by not ringing it in. 2) I don't think anyone who said keep it, its a thief.  I have never stole anything in my life, so I don't appreciate the notion that I am one."
166963,John,2008-03-03 15:47:00,2956," I think that the store that the item came from is irrelevant Stoty.  I also think that that ""certain guy"" who went to that ""certain sale"" would know at the checkout whether or not he had been charged for something or not.  To me, it's a no-brainer. If you had all intentions of buying the item in the first place, what's to think about? Pay for the dang vest..........."
166965,pikehunter,2008-03-03 15:48:00,1659,"It was not free, it was stolen.  The cashier screwed up by not ringing it in even though it is not your friends fault the store security would have viewed it as stolen. If he was asked to produce his receipt upon leaving the store and the vest was not listed he very well could have been charged with theft under $1000. Doesn't matter if the cashier screwed up or not as the store would have looked at him square in the eye and said that he knew it was not rung in because the total definitely did not balance. A one or 2 dollar item could be overlooked as a mistake but not a hundred dollar item.  So he got away with it, OK he got something for nothing, it is theft no matter how you want to turn it around to make you feel better. Say he did get nabbed what would happen next? I'll tell you: A trip down to the local cop shop for finger printing, a criminal charge followed by a visit to the lawyers office and a nice little legal bill and then time off work as you stand in front of the judge pleading innocence, ""Honestly officer, I didn't know she messed up, I really did think that the vest was only a dollar or 2 and didn't notice it."". Would it have been worth it then?  Don't think this could have happened? Hah! Tell it to the judge.  OK anyone can make a mistake and calculate the purchase total incorrectly and be off by a small amount, but not an error like the cost on the vest."
166967,Stoty,2008-03-03 15:51:00,2910,"Well, it depends on how much he bought. If he bought a whole bunch of stuff, then he might not have realized that the cashier missed something until he returned home. It most definitely is NOT his fault."
166968,Stoty,2008-03-03 15:52:00,2910," So, if this was a $3 spoon that was missed, that would be OK???"
166969,Terry,2008-03-03 15:54:00,14456,in life there are no mistakes till you decide not the fix it..........    ........................don't know what that means but I felt the need to say something profound ............................................
166970,John,2008-03-03 15:55:00,2956," Please Stoty, don't insult our intelligence! It was not a $5, $10 or even $20 item. Do you pay an invoice without looking at the bill? Hey, maybe you do?"
166972,Stoty,2008-03-03 16:00:00,2910,"I am not insulting anyones intelligence. So, each time you go to the grocery store and buy 100 items, you go over it with a fine tooth comb in your car before leaving, and if they missed a can of soup, your going to go back in and pay for it?  I am simply saying....he obviously missed the cashiers error, or he wouldn't have bothered posting it on here. I highly doubt he knew it was missed, then thought, ""Hey this would be a great topic for OFC.""  Everyone needs a break sometimes...."
166973,wolfville,2008-03-03 16:00:00,396,"Bring it back, I think you are gonna do that anyway otherwise you won't post it here.  Next time, keep the receipt but don't double check."
166974,John,2008-03-03 16:06:00,2956," OK, let me put it to you in simple terms. A Mustang Fishing Jacket is what?......say $150 on sale? You wouldn't notice that was not on your bill...  Actually, when I checkout anywhere, whether it's the grocery store or not, I watch each item as it is scanned or manually input into the system..  We make our own breaks Stoty, this is a big boys world that we live in!"
166979,Stoty,2008-03-03 16:13:00,2910,"Don't talk to me as though I am stupid or below you, because I am most definitely not!  The price of the item isn't the issue here. Its the fact that it wasn't paid for. But I guess you're too ignorant to see that."
166980,Big Cliff,2008-03-03 16:17:00,6899,The minute you take anything that isn't rightfully yours you stole it!
166984,danbo,2008-03-03 16:22:00,2646,What would Jesus do?
166986,irishfield,2008-03-03 16:24:00,26272, He didn't need a life vest....
166987,John,2008-03-03 16:25:00,2956," Ahhhh yes Stoty, I was wondering how long it would take for you to resort to flaming! Seems as though any controversial thread that you get involved in deteriorates this way.  No one is insinuating anything with regards to your level intelligence or whether you are below me (us), whatever that means. We are expressing our opinions with due consideration to the facts provided, that's all.  My illustration of the price of the item (its magnitude) was simply to illustrate how it could possibly not be noticed as not charged by the purchaser.  Maybe this thread has run its course, I'm done here......"
166988,Stoty,2008-03-03 16:25:00,2910, LOL
166752,mepps,2008-03-02 23:47:00,1301,"I'd have to say it's karma that you got it free - you must have done some good deeds last week! MAybe the cashier had a crush on you (err your friend) and did it on purpose  To be perfectly honest, I'd probably keep it - but i'd be spending that extra money at that store for sure.  That kinda thing never happens to me though.  Usually I get home and notice I've been double charged for items"
166756,bramptonjerry,2008-03-02 23:51:00,132,the cashier was a guy.....although he was nice looking
166770,mepps,2008-03-03 00:22:00,1301,"Then he did it on purpose, just so you'd go back!"
166783,OhioFisherman,2008-03-03 00:45:00,6623,"Never had it happen to me, I go in with an idea on what I am spending, not afraid to pay a fair price or pass on an item I think is over priced.  LOL at this stage of the game a life jacket wouldn`t be a high priority item."
166796,Bernie,2008-03-03 01:21:00,3190,Years ago I may not have returned it. Now with a few years of life experience there would be no question it would be taken back or paid for.

Gas goes up and down like a yo yo as does groceries, electronics and everything else we buy. I wouldn't feel bad, I'd feel like sometimes KARMA comes my way."
166807,Rizzo,2008-03-03 01:40:00,4754,"Can't say I recall ever getting home before realizing it.  My problem is I've already done the math in my head so I notice mistakes right away at the register.  Actually happened to me yesterday and I did point it out to them that the bill was too low, they were kind enough to increase it.  Other times that I've pointed it out they've attributed it to something ""being on sale""...kind of like the gas auger we heard about a few days ago"
166813,HTHM,2008-03-03 02:01:00,4082,"it boils down to: "" Who you are when no-one is looking"" WHat is the right thing to do, and what was your reaction when they made a mistake and tried to bill you 10 for a 2 dollar item?"

(Just being a wise donkey.......but seriously I agree with other it's not worth the bad Karma)
166863,Bernie,2008-03-03 03:55:00,3190, So if you dropped your wallet it's your mistake. Someone else gets to keep it? Same thing. My conscience would not allow me to do that.
166874,sirfish,2008-03-03 04:27:00,175,"This question seems to have brought out all the hypocrits.  IMO.....Tell your buddy   , Happy birthday."
166878,JerseyDog,2008-03-03 05:02:00,190,"Since you already admit you plan to go back next week, I can't think of a good reason why you wouldn't do the right thing.  Its probably hard enough these days for LeBaron to compete without having their money walk out the door and by their good customers even.  Now, if they undercharged a little, that would be totally different in my book."
166883,verno,2008-03-03 05:17:00,178,I'd call and tell the manager now.  He'll likely tell you not to bother bringing it back.  Having said that one time I was buying a rod and reel at a going out of business sale and the cashier charged me for the rod and not the reel.  I checked after I paid and told the cashier.  She rang the reel in separately and then screwed up with the debit machine and cancelled the transaction and told me to have a good day.  I left without paying for the reel.
166889,Tinman,2008-03-03 06:11:00,376,"I think that i would probably go back, I went back for a Bag of potatoes last week the casher never charged me for on th bottom of my cart. If she had double charges you for the for th vest ,would you have posted that on this board as to what to do?"
166898,Big Cliff,2008-03-03 11:13:00,6899,"Some really interesting replies! I think it all boils down to ""you have to do what feels right for you"", if you want to live with it then it doesn't really matter what anyone else would do. I would be interested in hearing what you decide though."
166900,solopaddler,2008-03-03 11:27:00,8605,Personally I'd take it back.

166912,lunkerbasshunter,2008-03-03 12:58:00,2585,yep i would return and pay for it for sure!  knowing my luck if i didnt it wouldnt float for me lol  CHeers!
166914,Moosebunk,2008-03-03 13:02:00,3970,"What if some bad karma had already happened to you and this was the good karma that came your way.  For all those karma believers, (me too) turning down good karma would surely be cause for some bad karma to come your way.  It seems to me that right now you're really munchin' on the tip of a big juicy karma pickle.  Careful when you bite, cause karma pickle juice in your eye can really sting."
166749,Rich Clemens,2008-03-02 23:36:00,3131,"Well, if the store would charge this friend for something he did not purchase or was charged too much ... would be complain ?    Return to the store and explain what happened and go from there."
