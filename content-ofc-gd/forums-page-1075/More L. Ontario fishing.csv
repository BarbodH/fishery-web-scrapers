166484,ehg,2008-03-02 04:43:00,2666,"Had some free time today and luckily my friend Dave did aswell, with north-nortwest winds it was safe to head out to spot on Lake Ontario. I've been here maybe 50 times in last 15 yrs. its tough going but kinda addictive. Many different species to be caught and the nice fish keep you coming back.  White bass were on today caught quite a few on shad coloured Rattlin Raps. My buddy Dave caught the nicer ones.    Then the Browns started hitting and we caught a bunch. Nothing large unfortunately. Here's some pics of similar sized brown trout nice little fighters that jump , almost  better scrappers than bass.      More browns were caught of similar size plus sheepshead and OOS smallmouth. Nice way to spend a few hours a little chilly out though.  cheers,  ehg"
166490,Ramble,2008-03-02 05:05:00,713,Nice fish! Those white bass are BIG!  Congrats.  -R-
166511,majorlifts,2008-03-02 06:37:00,171,"OMG, !!!The best day in at least 2 years, I mean cmon we`ve had some good days out there on Lake O, but this was phonominil. Double header!! I can`t wait to go again.  Strange though, one year browns, one year walleyes. That Lake sure does throw you for a loop sometimes. ya never know what yer gonna get."
166513,young_one,2008-03-02 07:47:00,620,"Hardcore! With my free time today, I took a nice warm nap. Excellent fishing."

166659,majorlifts,2008-03-02 18:32:00,171,"Yes good point irishfield, we are so lucky here in Ontario to have so many great water ways, and lands to hunt and hike on. My only regret is not getting taking advantage of it as much as I should have. But then theres days like this that make up for it."
166701,fishindevil,2008-03-02 21:35:00,6254,"Nice catch guys !!!!.  ..man thats been one of my favourite fishing spots for over 20yrs now,its too bad i dont fish it more,like i used too !!!nice pics of those big white bass,and love those football browns too !!!....cheers"
166738,Rich,2008-03-02 22:56:00,3927,"I'm jealous. I never thought silvers would hit this early. I think a trip out to my local outflow is imminent. If you don't mind me asking (I wont be anywhere near your spot, or lake for that matter, lol) what were the silvers hitting on? You can PM if you'd rather."
166745,mattyk,2008-03-02 23:25:00,2110,thanks for the report.
166797,tbayboy,2008-03-03 01:22:00,1497,And here i spent my day freezing on a simcoe chasing perch when you guys are doing some real fishing!  Well done!
166810,bramptonjerry,2008-03-03 01:50:00,132,wow...never hear of/seen white bass that big
166875,ehg,2008-03-03 04:30:00,2666,"Thanks for replies folks! There was a wind chill , felt warmer as the winds eased. Usually the bite is good at sunset/sunrise but the bite was midday this time due to onshore winds the days before creating turbidity lowering the visibility.  Nice to be trolling, casting and catching fish in the winter here. Gonna do it again when possible.   All fish were caught on medium sized shad Rattlin Raps. My buddy had the same lure on from start to finish.  cheers,  ehg"
166879,snag,2008-03-03 05:02:00,1932,Hat's off!
166882,highdrifter,2008-03-03 05:16:00,2534,Shweeeet.  The soft water is a tad deceiving when you think of how chilly it was outside!  Good on you for roughin it.  Those grins speak for themselves!  WTG  cheers HD
