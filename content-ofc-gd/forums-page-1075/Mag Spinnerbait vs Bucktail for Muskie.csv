166932,mattyk,2008-03-03 14:07:00,2110,Doulbe Cow girls are very popular down this way. Thay have 2 huge #10 blades. I think they are out with a bigger version also with #12 or 13 size colorado blades. Raf is right those baits with big blades are hard to bring in with a C3. I am thinking of getting a 7000 this year.

If I were to fish a lake like scugog for example, you can bet that a SB would be ahead of an inline for me.  A SB on a short leash behind the boat works great in the sloppy areas and, the single hook is definately more fish friendly too.   I'm sure JP would be happy to hear that, but the one I posted is a homemade job - quite a bit bigger than the cowgirl rage."
