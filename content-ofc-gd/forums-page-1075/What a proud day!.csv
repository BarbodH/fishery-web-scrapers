So, today was a family day out and before we headed to BPS, we stopped by Frozen Pond in Vaughan to meet Joe Carter. The wait was worth it because when I brought my daughter up to have a picture taking with the World Series hero, he was playing with her and making her laugh....it was funny...he looked at her, and she reached out and grabbed his face!!!  Here's some pics....  Waiting at the back of the line.....    And playing with Joe       Could a father be more proud lol...her first autograph!"
