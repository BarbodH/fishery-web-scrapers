166259,Sandbag,2008-03-01 16:29:00,533,Lots of good people here to help you out.  I'll bet the time of year that you are looking at as well as a rough idea of the area you are looking at will help get the ball rolling.  North of Barrie is pretty vast.  Cheers  Craig
166264,Big Cliff,2008-03-01 16:37:00,6899,"How far North of Barrie do you want to go? Are you looking for somewhere you can do some ice fishing? There are plenty of resorts in the Muskoka area, if you pick an area you are interesteded in and just type in ""resorts (and whatever area you want) in Goggle, you will get plenty of listings and information on them.  Enjoy your weekend away!"
166266,irishfield,2008-03-01 16:48:00,26272,Two items in the Auction for Tyler section !  As mentioned... what do you want to do? How far are you willing to drive? What do you expect included? Budget?
167088,Fishingfever,2008-03-03 20:52:00,27,I wouldnt want to go any further than Muskoka area.Budget is tight! Ice fishing a must.  Thanks John
