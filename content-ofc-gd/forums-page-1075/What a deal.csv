165764,Hawg Hunter,2008-02-29 00:56:00,204,"Best deal ive ever heard of.....a good friend of mine told me his buddy went to walmart in Kingston to buy a 10"" jiffy power auger.He found them on sale for $449.00 when he went up to the cash to ring it through the lady told him it won""t scan cause theres no bar code,he replied its on sale for $449.00.She picked up the phone and called sports the guy comes up looks at the auger and says ill be right back.He comes back and hands the lady the bar code and it rings up at $40.00 .He again says thats not right there on sale for $449.00,she inturns calls the manager over and she checks the bar code and say yes it matches we all clearing them all out .He again says it should be $449.00 the manager replies hey we do have good deals on winter items.  Sooooo he paid the $40.00+tax and left.I can""t figure out why the guy in sports would not know atleast aprox what it cost but as you read he tried to tell them 3-4 times and when the manager said yes it matches he bought it. Why does this never happen to me lol.lol.  Hawg Hunter"
165765,irishfield,2008-02-29 01:02:00,26272,I would have loaded a buggy up with every one on the shelf!  ... OR were you just overhearing the conversation he was having with his wife??
165766,TJQ,2008-02-29 01:03:00,7806,omg
165770,Rizzo,2008-02-29 01:14:00,4754,how late are they open...I'm on my way!  At least he tried to tell them they were making a mistake.
165772,Roy,2008-02-29 01:22:00,13728,"Ticketer had a bad day. The 6"" hand augers are $449.00."
166158,wallyboss,2008-03-01 03:08:00,1095,That's what I told my wife that I paid for my Quantum baitcaster at BPS today.
166184,lunkerbasshunter,2008-03-01 04:00:00,2585,and this company just posted 4billion dollar earnings for last quarter.  imagine what that number would be if they wanted to make some money and not give things away lol  cheers!
166199,johnnyb,2008-03-01 04:49:00,3413,wow...they really are lowering their prices everyday
166234,cranks bait,2008-03-01 13:29:00,721,Heading there tomorrow.  May have to see if it's still on for that price.  With the $10.00 coupon you can't really go wrong.  Although I don't ice fish.
166238,pikehunter,2008-03-01 13:44:00,1659,Looks like a Walmart manager is going to be looking for a new a job today. Like was said I would have bought the entire stock!
166325,Tacklebuster,2008-03-01 20:26:00,303,"I guess its ""worth  the trip to Kingston"";  sorry folks just had to to that."
166379,Corey,2008-03-01 22:41:00,355,He should have bought more!
166620,Tootsie II,2008-03-02 17:16:00,162,"I work in Sports at Wal-Mart and that's definitely a ""screw up"". Somebody was given some ""mark-down"" money and screwed up the price adjustment when entering it in the computer. It's probably been caught by now so you'd better call ahead to see if it's still available at $ 40.00 ."
166736,bramptonjerry,2008-03-02 22:54:00,132,the group sure views this differently than my post about the vest...I wonder why the big difference
166747,Terry,2008-03-02 23:32:00,14456,did you try to fix the mistake as he did or did you run yelling start the car start the car
166939,cranks bait,2008-03-03 14:36:00,721,"Went and checked it out yesterday.  Nothing.  The only Augers they had were 6"" hand augers for $45.00.  The whole trip was a bust.  Checked out CTC and they had a few things, including an old Stradic FH for $180.00.  Asked if it was on sale and their reply was people will buy so NO.  Well I guess i'll go else where and buy the new model for less then.  Guess I'll just sit here and read of all the deals being had at BPS   and wish I lived closer."
