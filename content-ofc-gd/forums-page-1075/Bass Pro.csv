166445,Stern Rules,2008-03-02 01:56:00,342,You gotta love those sales at Bass Pro. 
166450,Zib,2008-03-02 02:08:00,369,That's a nice score except the Fireline Crystal.
166455,beertech,2008-03-02 02:35:00,118,I have gone back to regular fireline myself lol.
166524,JEREMY,2008-03-02 12:17:00,300,Hey steve did you save any money for the sportsman show or did you spend it all?
166535,mistyriver1,2008-03-02 13:02:00,600,Good stuff !!  I've had good luck with those Frenzy Baits.
166692,Stern Rules,2008-03-02 21:01:00,342,I still got money and I think I should go back and get more stuff.
166700,fishindevil,2008-03-02 21:28:00,6254,"Nice haul !!!...i was there too and hit the berkley bin too,and grabbed about 8 of them.  ..and got some fireline as well,  man it sure was hot in there today,i left around 1pm couldnt take it anymore,but i did ok,and got what i wanted too !!!!!....cheers"
166710,Stern Rules,2008-03-02 21:52:00,342,I spent 4 hours there. It's impossible to just go in for a few minutes. I didn't even check out the tank or seminars either. The catfish samples were good. Should've gotten some of that hotsauce. Yummy.
166923,JEREMY,2008-03-03 13:42:00,300,Terry was talking about going  this weekend.
166982,bigbuck,2008-03-03 16:19:00,2449,"Oh Yeah, the Spring Fleecing at Bass Pro!!! I walked out $250 lighter. A pair of pants and a shirt for under $40, a new tackle box to replace my old one that was falling apart, a good deal at another $40, a PFD for myself and one for my daughter, some Trilene in 4,6, and 8lb test, a couple of X-Raps, a Bionic Bucktail.........Jeez, I needed a shopping cart. It was great meeting The Next Bite crew, I spent a fair bit of time talking to Pete Maina and Gary Parsons. They're a great bunch of guys, easy to talk to and very willing to help with some tips and ideas on techniques. If only I could watch their show, the magazine is great."
167025,bbog,2008-03-03 17:38:00,665,"Was I the only one scouring the parking lot looking for a shopping cart    I did find one eventually - man what a crowd. Few things I came for were out of stock such as the Berkeley Gulp Alive spray, but got most of what I wanted. Now hoping the items catch the fish like they caught me!!"
167027,TJQ,2008-03-03 17:43:00,7806,I can't wait to get in there...  Ill be there on the afternoon of the 14th... I sure do hope theres inventory left.. you guys are gonna get it all!!!
167072,kennyman,2008-03-03 19:54:00,737,"I was there yesterday too, although I wouldn't know anyone from the board (except father of 3) if I fell over them. I keep an eye out for an OFC hat or shirt,whether there or at a fishing show etc but haven't seen one yet. I was at a show at one of the warehouses I buy from and was going right by on the way home,plus my uncle who came with me had never been there, so I just had to stop ...... you know LOL. I bought five packs of plastics (two yum shakey worms,one Yum ribbon tail, one blue/white tubes,one Zoom white trick worms) ,two lures (super spot and a popper) and two packs of Gamakatsu offset worm hooks and came out for $ twenty two something tax in.You gotta like it!  I would have bought a bit more,but half the stuff I went in for they had already sold out of. I guess half a deal is better than no deal. I also stopped off in Burlington and got some hand tied jigs on the way but we'll leave that until tonight when I can post pics. These things are beautiful."
167078,eagsfan93,2008-03-03 20:26:00,15,"You got some good crankbaits there, I hope that there is still some good stuff left there when I go up on the 9th............."
167104,maybe,2008-03-03 21:43:00,307,"Took me til 5pm Saturday to drag Hubby out to Bass Pro.  Already big holes in the shelves then.  We likely would've wasted a couple hundred $$ if they'd had stock, but walked out with a total bill well under $50.  I'll likely be heading down by myself just for the seminars on the 14th.  Did anybody else get slimed by closed buckets of Gulp! Alive! minnows?  I was excited about trying them, until I realized how much time I'd spend scrubbing that stuff out of car and boat upholstry."
167133,bassmaster4,2008-03-03 23:07:00,801,nice lures man ive gotta make a trip down there and get some stuff
167143,lookinforwalleye,2008-03-03 23:50:00,4399,"I just got back from my annual Bass Pro Spring shopping spree and I actually spent less than I normally do.  To my surprise that had a lot of Shimano gear on sale, I went specifically to purchase a Cumara rod and then I noticed they had Crucial`s on sale so I picked up a nice dropshot rod for 50 bucks off. The Crucial was 139 and the Cumara was 269. I just could not justify spending 130 more for the Cumara. Also picked up some tubes at 4 bags for 10 bucks,some x-raps,gulp minnows,assorted hooks etc. at pretty good prices."
167145,Gawel,2008-03-03 23:53:00,27,"There deals are so hard to resist sometimes.  I try not to buy too much there, but on the weekend I walked away with a few too many lures.  I have too many lures that have been on the waiting list for close to a year due to sales such as this.  Some of the poor lures I purchased at bass pro this past weekend may not even get upgraded to permanent tackle box status till next year.  Forget about getting any water time.  There must be a scientific name for it, but I do get a brief high when I purchase all these lures.  It lasts usually until the visa bill arrives."
167167,Roy,2008-03-04 00:35:00,13728,"I don't get to Bass Pro Shops very often because it's a 8-900 mile round trip for me but I always have a good time in there. What I like about the place aside from the fact  that they have a lot of product at reasonable prices is that the place is also a tourist attraction. If I happen to be in there with someone who's not into fishing, there's all kinds of other things for them to check out. There's also always a very good chance you'll run into an OFNer or two."
167188,Rizzo,2008-03-04 01:41:00,4754,"nice looking loot! I'm just not sure about the hat, why pay to advertise for them?  they should be giving those things away"
167252,Guest lundboy,2008-03-04 04:47:00,0,That's an excellent price on the crucial dropshot.  I bought one last year (at the regular price) and it's been great.  You'll love it.
167311,cranks bait,2008-03-04 13:52:00,721," After reading your post it makes me feel good for shopping at my local tackle shop.  I managed to get a Cumara rod from them last year with tax for less than what I see Bass Pro has it for.  A couple of weekends back when I was at Lebaron I was looking for the Cumara to see what their price was.  They had none that I could see.  However they did have the Crucial dropshot rod on for roughly $160.00.  Add that with the no tax deal they had going on, I couldn't pass it up.  It will be interesting to see the difference between these two rods as they are the same specs."
