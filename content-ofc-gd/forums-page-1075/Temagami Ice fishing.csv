166762,rhare,2008-03-03 00:05:00,387,Does anyone know if I can hire a guide for a day to take me to some spots on the lake? I have my own gear and sled but have never been to the lake before.   thanks in advance  Ryan
166771,Terry,2008-03-03 00:25:00,14456,"Well Wayne is the best known guide on the lake, he does some winter guiding but summer charters are his specialties .......I think he does a water taxi and canoe towing service too.."
166773,irishfield,2008-03-03 00:26:00,26272,"    Ryan.. the only guy I can think of that ""guides"" is Rick Lockhart.. x owner of Ketchenany Lodge.  When you thinking of going up? and how many guys?"
166899,moose,2008-03-03 11:16:00,266,"send me an eamil and i vwill send u ricks nimber a freind of mine , also john harding a swell"
166905,rhare,2008-03-03 12:00:00,387,"Wayne   I'm thinking the 15,16th weekend or the 22,23rd. I must say after seeing your laker, I had to go  do you have a # for him wayne?   thanks  Ryan"
166913,Terry,2008-03-03 13:00:00,14456,I think it closes on the 15th..doesn't it..I might be wrong...
166915,Moosebunk,2008-03-03 13:05:00,3970, Think you're right Terry... I guess that would mean hiring a guide to guide yer butt right off the lake into some backlakes
166917,rhare,2008-03-03 13:17:00,387,"I wondered that, I couldnt find my regs this morning to check. Well I guess I might have to try some of the other area lakes insted or wait until next yr."
166918,rhare,2008-03-03 13:20:00,387,"regs say 3rd sun in march, I might be ok."
166944,irishfield,2008-03-03 14:45:00,26272,"Yep... Zone 11 is written for weekend anglers unlike BOQ's. Sunday after the third Saturday... and the problem is it's the entire Zone 11 now not just Lake Temagami. I left my reg print out at the cottage. Guess I'd better go over to CTC today and get a copy, and see what other options there are after the 16th.  Malcom's got you covered for Rick's and John's #'s, Ryan.  I was going to go up this weekend... and why I asked how many guys... but that seems to have gone in the can on me at this point."
