He thinks that he is smarter than the cop because he is a lawyer from LONDON and is certain that he has a better education then any Jock cop.  He decides to prove this to himself and have some fun at the Glasgow cop's expense!!  Glasgow cop says, 'License and registration, please.'  London Lawyer says,  'What for?'  Glasgow cop says, 'Ye didnae come to a complete stop at the stop sign.'   London Lawyer says, 'I slowed down, and no one was coming.'   Glasgow cop says, 'Ye still didnae come to a complete stop. License and  registration, please.'  London Lawyer says, 'What's the difference?'  Glasgow cop says, 'The difference is, ye huvte to come to complete stop, that's the law, License and registration, please!'  London Lawyer says, 'If you can show me the legal difference between slow down and stop, I'll give you my license and registration; and you give me the ticket. If not, you let me go and don't give me the ticket.'    Glasgow cop says, 'Sounds fair. Exit your vehicle, sir.'  The London Lawyer exits his vehicle.  The Glasgow cop takes out his baton and starts beating the crap out of the lawyer and says, 'Dae ye want me to stop, or just slow down?'"

167046,Kirk,2008-03-03 18:22:00,347,"From a financial standpoint, the money from the police assault lawsuit will far exceed the fine for a stop sign.  Straight forward turning a loss into a profit.  (funnier version I heard long ago, the lawyer is standing hands on the hood...now did you want me to slow down or stop !!!)"
