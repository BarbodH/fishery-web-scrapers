166209,Carp,2008-03-01 06:14:00,1488,"Mouth of the big French girls on Georgian Bay? Yeah, that brings back a lot of memories.  Sorry, couldn't resist.  Seriously, I haven't been up there for a while myself and I don't think I ever fished that area in the spring. Some fantastic scenery though."
166236,Bernie,2008-03-01 13:35:00,3190,I find the French is better fishing when the water warms up in July and August. They may be there in the early going too but usually don't head down there because the fishing is good in the South Bay area. Carp is right about how beautiful it is. It's nice to go just for the scenery.
166258,Big Cliff,2008-03-01 16:27:00,6899,I never fished there early spring mostly because I lived up river near the Flat Rapids and running down the shoot in high water was just plain dangerous even for those of us that knew the river well. I always got plenty of fish much closer to home choosing to fish areas like the train bridge below the Flat Rapids or fishing below the Flat Rapids in the morning and above the rapids in the evening. I did fish down there later on in the summer when the water levels dropped and use to do very well just using a night crawler on a hook with a barrel sinker to get me down to bottom in the current.  Sure is a beautiful area though as is most of the French River.
