167149,ehg,2008-03-04 00:01:00,2666,Thats an incredible huge walleye! Congrats on a once in a lifetime fish. (maybe there is more for you though)  Always went to mouth of Talbot R. on Simcoe in last week of March to get big 'pickies'. Ended up getting my PB of over 16 lbs. there over 10 yrs. ago.  I've seen near 20 lbs. fish coming off the ice there caught by locals. With the season now closed March 15th on Simcoe it really protects these fish around the Talbot.  Always swore there was world record walleye in Simcoe. Now with the new season its like finding a needle in 100 haystacks.  Congrats on that huge and rare walleye from Simcoe.  ehg

164995,OhioFisherman,2008-02-27 12:39:00,6623,Very nice fish and a great release.
165013,jat,2008-02-27 13:10:00,138,what type of jig is that? A foxee minnow?
165015,Ramble,2008-02-27 13:18:00,713,WOW! That is a beast of a walleye. Congrats.  -R-
165030,corvette1,2008-02-27 13:56:00,1765,fish of a lifetime mine is a 16lbs now we keeping trying for bigger one
165041,Zib,2008-02-27 14:17:00,369,Nice fish Greg. I'm glad to see walleye caught in Simcoe. I read an article a few years ago that talked about how bad the walleye population had declined in Simcoe.
165051,Fang,2008-02-27 14:37:00,1330,"Nice one.  Simcoe has some big walleye's and a few show up every year off the east side out in the ""trout"" grounds. My buddy poked one 11.5 a few years back on a whitefish tip up and a pinhead minnow.  Just goes to show you the size and quality of the walleye run that goes up the Talbot river. Very impressive catch"
165087,Joey,2008-02-27 15:56:00,9122,"WOW  Congrats Greg, that is one splendid fish!!!  Joey"
165091,kennyman,2008-02-27 16:08:00,737,WOW!! Gotta love that 24 carat gold beauty. From Simcoe none the less. Awesome!
165093,Hawg Hunter,2008-02-27 16:16:00,204,"very nice clean eye,WTG  Hawg Hunter"
165099,nelly,2008-02-27 16:36:00,256,"Nice looking eye Greg. It's been awhile, maybe 5-7 years since we caught walleye from Simcoe. We get them in the spring while we are pike fishing and they are from cooks bay around 5-6 lbs."
165101,linweir,2008-02-27 16:43:00,202,Thumb up. There are some monsters in Beaverton area.
165121,fishnsled,2008-02-27 17:18:00,3520,What a healthy looking fish.  Great pics and congrats on the PB
165204,wuchikubo,2008-02-27 19:30:00,1114,Congrats on your new PB Greg!
166985,Slayingm,2008-03-03 16:23:00,204,Nater and Jat... sorry the delayed reply but have been out on Simcoe nailing some nice Whities and Lakers the past few days and not been on the PC..... Yes that was one of the new Blue Fox Foxee Minnows (Humpback) jigs.  That was one of two different colours I designed for them that they put into production.... the small size really nails the Jumbo Perch too!.....Greg.
167002,Cookslav,2008-03-03 17:07:00,1457,Thats a beautifull eye for sure....Way to go on the PB!  Just curious did you take any measurments? I'd love to know for poops and giggles
167004,danbo,2008-03-03 17:11:00,2646,Atta boy
167131,camillj,2008-03-03 22:45:00,1988,wow ! ... I mean ... WOW !!!!  Been many years since I chased Pickerel on Simcoe with any success ... congrats  ... and nice camera work  Thanks for sharing
167139,Big Cliff,2008-03-03 23:40:00,6899,She sure looks nice and healthy! Congratulations on a beautiful fish and a quick release!
167147,mikeymikey,2008-03-04 00:00:00,376,That is superb catch !  Oh I just realized that your member number is '666'.  No wonder you're a kick ass fisherman.
164847,Slayingm,2008-02-27 01:01:00,204,Was out on Simcoe this past w/e working some of my GPS laker/Whitefish spots and got a real surprize..... my new PB Walleye estimated at 15lb or more.  My previous best was a 13.5lb fish taken from Quinte and few years back and it was definately dwarfed by this gut busting eye laiden female Walleye.  3 other anglers came over to see the fish and figured it was at least 15lbs of more as they have taken a 12lb fish before and said it was so much smaller then this one. I released her after a couple of quick pics and still can't believe I was able to pull her out of the hole!!  I was working the bottom slowly with a jig in approx. 50ft of water.      Take care and good luck out there..... Greg. 
164852,Casey123,2008-02-27 01:09:00,461,Very Cool!!!
164853,taper,2008-02-27 01:09:00,611,"Congrats on the PB Greg, I've never even heard of them like that in Simcoe. By the way also very nice to see it released to fight another day. Congrats again."

164867,Nater,2008-02-27 01:22:00,68,"Nice fish greg...Curious if you had the foxee jig tipped with a pinhead or if he hit just the bare jig?  great walleye for simcoe, and awesome to hear that it went back to swim another day  Nate"
164874,danc,2008-02-27 01:31:00,4677,That thing is HUGE!!! Congrats.

164941,huntervasili,2008-02-27 03:56:00,1604,"What a walleye! WTG on the PB, and great pics"
