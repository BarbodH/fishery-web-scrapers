767850,Larry D,2013-02-14 19:33:00,3,Was just reading all the comments and we have a piece of land on Lorimer Lake.  Just bought it actually and have found that the staff at the town hall....whitestone.  They are helpful with what you can build and will guide you thru the process.  I drove up there to chat with them and its pretty easy.  I am allowed to build a couple shacks (bunkies for later) that we will use for storage untill we build the cottage.  We are supposed to sleep in a tent and there is no limit as to how long it can be there(in the case of a trailer I am sure its the same).  Its a great are and the fishing on Lorimer is great.  My only question would be if  the ice fishing is any good on Lorimer?  My wife and I are going up to have a look at our land and I thought it might be nice to do some fishing on the ice as I have never don that before....any thoughts?  
767953,bassassin,2013-02-15 03:23:00,152,"I hear the lake trout fishing is great on Lorimer, congrats on the purchase. i read the bylaws and it says there is a 30 day limit on trailers. The staff at the Whitestone office including the building official are phenominal and go out of their way to help you. They even put me intouch with whitestone resort who were giving away their 2,3 and 4 bedroom cottages for free! the only catch was you had to bring them to your site which costs 20k+...  Im hoping to clear the lot and install a driveway this year spring/summer theres a guy on my street there with a gravel quarry and equipment that most people go to, but if Skip is still willing to help and the price is right then he's my man and he should be yours too!"
768029,Larry D,2013-02-15 15:25:00,3,"Thanks for the reply.  I hope you get the people together to put your dream cottage up for as little cost as possible.  Its a nice area and our kids love it up there.  So do you know how the snow is this time of year?  There must be a ton of it now.  We are hoping to head up soon to do a bit of snowmobile fun and spend a night in a hotel sso we can go see our land.  When building, its important to see the land in all 4 seasons so you build it in the right spot.  Any one have any builders or tradesmen that they recommend?  We have a septic guy all set already but thats all."
768042,Rod Caster,2013-02-15 16:02:00,5784,"Those pics you posted, that's Igor a local guide. That guy catches big fish like nobody else. Met him this summer in Dunchurch. Nice guy. Best of luck with your new property"
768207,Larry D,2013-02-16 14:45:00,3,"This is all new to me, so how do I get in touch with the guy you guys mentioned?  I didnt see any pics either, so maybe you guys can enlighten me as to how you move around this site to see more?  Thanks and we are heading up today to seee how the snow and Ice is on Lorimer lake."
768212,4x4bassin,2013-02-16 14:58:00,1025,"I have a trailer on Lorimer and a couple friends as well , they were up there last week snowmobiling and said there was lots of snow and ice . Actually they went all the way up to Loring on the trails and lakes with no problems. I know a couple contractors  that work on that lake but I can't get a hold of them till spring , thats when we start to see them around the park . If you need any info on the area let me know and I will help you out when I can !"

660448,bassassin,2012-01-26 03:04:00,152,"Several months back I posed a question as to whether or not i can find a lakefront property for appx. 100k?  It turns out after a year of searching I purchased 2 acres of lakefront property with 290' of shoreline on Shawanaga lake. What i'm trying to say is perseverance pays of! I went above my budget by a whopping 10k LOL! the lake is 9km long and pretty beautiful i must say.  Has any one fished this lake? its right above Lorimer lake just north of parry sound, off of hwy 124. Now the fun begins, i have to figure out how to put in a driveway clear the lot and build a cottage on a budget of 5k. This hurdle may prove to be impossible to clear! LOL..."
660454,danbouck,2012-01-26 03:15:00,4380,lots here http://www.recreationland.net/
660459,irishfield,2012-01-26 03:25:00,26272,"Last I heard it was fished out and why land was cheap!  The real question will be can you build on it, etc?  I bought 26 acres and 4000 feet of shoreline for not much more.. but the fight to build isn't worth the lost sleep.  Shawanaga is supposed to have Lake Herring in it.... and looks like Pike as well.  Go here and type the lake in search and start reading.  http://www.web2.mnr.gov.on.ca/fish_online/fishing/fishingExplorer_en.html"
660462,Pigeontroller,2012-01-26 03:28:00,2793,"Start with an older trailer, should be able to find many for under 5K."
660480,bassassin,2012-01-26 03:50:00,152,"the only issue with building lies in the docking, must use a floating dock other than that im good to build when i can afford to !  Apparently you can only have a trailer on the site for no more than 30 days.  I figure i'll be able to afford to build on it just in time for my kids to be too old to want to hang out with their old man."
660486,bassassin,2012-01-26 03:52:00,152," lake herring large mouth small mouth lake sucker pike and it was stocked with walleye which apparently didnt take, but i plan to find them..."
660488,irishfield,2012-01-26 03:54:00,26272,"Although I suspect.. with the ""no trailer for more than 30 days"" Bull.. that their planning act says no ""accessory"" buildings prior to a main dwelling/residence. As long as you've done nothing to be under planning control they can't stop you from building less than 10 square metres... as it doesn't fall under the building act, as long as there is no plumbing inside said structure. Outhouse and camp kitchen under a tent awning."
660496,bassassin,2012-01-26 04:00:00,152, i plan on building a 10' x 10' bunkie to start off!!  Heres a local guys catches on the lake my lot is on:  http://www.ontarioanglerawards.com/Entry/Details.cfm?EntryID=28640  http://www.ontarioanglerawards.com/Entry/Details.cfm?EntryID=30369
660498,Skipper D,2012-01-26 04:06:00,1970,"  Send me a Pm and i'll show you my web site , i might just be able to keep you with in your budjet or at least for some of it"
660500,irishfield,2012-01-26 04:09:00,26272,"If you can clear his lot, put in a driveway and build him a cottage for 5K Ron... I want a 2 for 1 deal!"
660501,bassassin,2012-01-26 04:12:00,152, Good idea that means i only need to cough up $2500... 
660504,Skipper D,2012-01-26 04:16:00,1970,  Well i was thinking i could do something for him where the clearing and driveway are consern

660506,irishfield,2012-01-26 04:22:00,26272,.oh and as for the trailer. Get your inspection for septic system.. install it first if you know where the cottage will go. Make a level pad for the trailer so you can easily park it and just have it drain it into the septic. Leave it there three weeks at a time and then tow it home for the following week. Then bring it back... or just tow it up each weekend.
660507,spud7378,2012-01-26 04:27:00,68,"im a hydro lineman/ electrician, maybe i could help you out with your power? let me know when your ready i could give you a price!"
660513,bassassin,2012-01-26 04:48:00,152, there's a transformer between this lot and the lot next to it!
660514,Skipper D,2012-01-26 05:08:00,1970,"P.S Jason , remember its cheaper to remove the trees with the stump with the excavator , so don't go cutting them all down till you know for sure ."
660515,ohhenrygsr,2012-01-26 05:18:00,947, That's an awesome website
660536,bubbles,2012-01-26 12:27:00,591,"Way to go man, let the fun begin. Let us know when the house warming is!"
661588,walleye wanderer,2012-01-29 02:12:00,64,"  Sweet! Never fished Shawanaga but I snowmobiled the hell out of it. I have fished Lorimer Lake for many years and the fishing is still very good there and very restricted as there is a Tim Hortons camp on it. Many years ago we did stop in MNR office in Parry Sound and reviewed the local marine biologists reports on Lorimer, I am sure they would have similar info for Shawanaga and I'd say it is worth the stop. Regardless, this is a beautiful place with lots of peace & quiet and not loaded with houseboats and jet skis, you will enjoy! ps. nice lakers in Lormier in the winter  "
661607,bucktail,2012-01-29 03:16:00,1857,Big pike and you dont have far to go to Geo Bay!
661808,hookerdown,2012-01-30 00:48:00,110,"What my brother (Bassassin) didn't mention is that he already recruitted his older brother as cheap slave labour to clear his lot by hand.  We chipped him and bought him a chainsaw for his bday (which was the same week he took possession of the lot.  But he told me that I will have to use a hatchet and that he wants to keep his chainsaw in mint condition.  He also mentioned that he can't wait to watch me try to bring down some of the larger trees with the hatchet, while he sips down a couple of brown pops.  And if I survive that, he will let me drop a line from shore using a stick and line (but no hook).  Ahhh family."
661856,4x4bassin,2012-01-30 03:08:00,1025,"I have a place over on Lorimer but I have heard some good things about Shawanaga,I'm going to try to get over there this summer and chuck a spinnerbait around .Congrats on your new lot , it will bring you and your family good times for years to come"
662153,bassassin,2012-01-31 03:17:00,152, Lorimer is beautiful too! cant wait to start playing around up there.
