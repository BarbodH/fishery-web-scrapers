We both arrived at our first location at about 11:30, after hauling the gear out and getting set up it was about noon. We set 2 tip ups near a point with a large drop off in hopes of getting a pike or maybe even a walleye. Once those were set up we decided to try scout the area to try and find some structure for panfish. We marked a few weeds and a couple fish, but nothing that wanted what we were offering. About 20 minutes in Jeremy's tip up went off, he ran over to check it but there was nothing there, but whatever it was scared all the panfish away  Tip ups reset we ventured out a little farther from the point to find a reef that came up about 6ft, when I first dropped the flasher down all that it was marking was bottom, but as I was about to lift it up and go to the next hole a small flicker came up just off bottom. I dropped down my panfish jig and pinhead expecting a crappie or perch, after about a minute I knew it wasn't a panfish because I wan't getting a second look. But I kept working it, and a minute or so later the whole bottom started moving up to my jig! And before I knew it I had a fish on, the whole ""fight"" lasted about 20 seconds and felt like I was pulling up a weed, but once I got it up it turned out to be a nice 20"" hammer handle.    Released to be caught another day I got my line right back down, and the same thing happened! This was another big fish (probably pike) that gave lots of head shakes, but as I was about to get my first look it shook my jig  Jeremy guessed it was probably about 5lbs.  After that things slowed down and we decided to move to a smaller lake. First hole drilled we were marking fish and were really hopeful that they were crappie, but why would they be? Turned out to just be another school of dink perch  Jeremy got one of them but that was it, we finished the day with 1 pike and 4 perch. here are a couple more pics  Jeremy trying to coax some perch:  Ice was thick! Also, LOVE his finbore "

768128,NAW,2013-02-16 00:59:00,4022,"Slow day, but atleast you got some slim between your fingers!  I'll be heading up that way Monday to try toget team 1 a fat g-bay pike!"
768133,Acountdeleted,2013-02-16 01:15:00,2562,"Dang kids, steal your auger, steal your flasher, catch your fish. Haha.  Naw I'm just having fun. Its was great to see chris bring up that sweet pike. It was a shame he lost his other one too, it was fighting pretty good."
768135,Christopheraaron,2013-02-16 01:28:00,3525,"LOL, we can see who's better in the summer Jeremy"
768140,Leecher,2013-02-16 01:56:00,7832,"Sounds like you guys had fun prospecting   such a big word   nonetheless, you got some fish   That's what it's all about Great report and pics Thanks for sharing! TJunkie"
768141,Rod Caster,2013-02-16 02:00:00,5784,You guys did a lot of scouting...that finbore MUST be sharp!
768422,Moosebunk,2013-02-17 16:40:00,3970,"Have the same auger and like it too.  Once ice is greater than 18 inches or so, the Jiffy comes out.  Otherwise, I'm fine drilling 20-30 holes a day with the FinnBore III.  Overall, an OK day of pannies for ya.  They made you and Jer work though."
