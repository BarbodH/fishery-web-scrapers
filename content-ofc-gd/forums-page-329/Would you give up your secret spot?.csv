767885,fishindevil,2013-02-14 22:36:00,6254,"I think more importantly it's not necessarily the ""spot"" but as some of us know the real secret is the spot on the spot that's all the difference in the world !!!!! It's all in the old saying ""pay attention to the details"" can make an average good spot into a secret honey-hole !!!!!! That's the true secret and that usually only comes with doing your homework and putting in the hours !!!!!!!"
767897,chris.brock,2013-02-14 23:35:00,4053,"I had an interesting, relevant, chat on the ice this past weekend, with some cottage friends.

That said, I'm not adding to the pressure by providing the interweb with pinpoint directions. Also I am even more protective of spots that have been shared with me from someone else.  There is also a hierarchy for species/spots. A bass shoal on a big lake versus a tiny brook trout stream near a big city."

767968,danc,2013-02-15 05:23:00,4677,Then why did I give up some of my spots to you? lol
767979,muddler,2013-02-15 11:45:00,623,"Nope! I did once and only once and I regretted that. I have fished a local lake for over 50 years. No internet, no depth chart, dept sounders or gps. I was easy to catch a 5LB+ smallmouth regularly here. It was a small rock mound  about 10 feet across some 50 feet away from a large weedy bay surrounded by 30-35 feet of deeper water. Some days I would catch dozen, some fish I would catch 3 or more times a season.  Back then I was one of those weird guys that would release trophy fish. One day my neighbour( I've known this guy for over 55 years. Great guy) asked me to take him fishing, as he had never caught a bass over 2 lb. Ok, I agreed with the condition that this spot was to be kept secret and that all fish be returned to the lake healthy. Sure no problem. Well we had one of those epic days. We hooked and landed so many large bass that we lost track. WOW! We put them all back! The next weekend I go out and decided to check out my spot first thing in the morning. There is my neighbour with his boat, and two other boats(friends of his) each with 3 guys in the boat fishing that little spot. All using minnow and worms and keeping only the ""big"" fish on the stringer. Later that day they made a photo shoot and a party next door to my place.  6X9 = 54 large bass(6 fish limit back then) got killed that day. The pictures got passed around and soon everyone and their brother was fishing there. That spot got wiped out. Last summer I hooked one bass about 4lbs. First one that size in almost 10 years from this spot.  Never,never ever will give out my spots. Never,never never again.  muddler"
767998,wantabigone,2013-02-15 13:35:00,97,"In your scenraio, no. However, if someone for instance on this board were to ask in a PM about a spot I would gladly share.  I also would share to a person I was talking to who enjoyed fishing. (assuming they believed in catch and release - only one or two for eating)  This is easy for my to say as all my honey holes are on fly-in lakes!"
768017,NBR,2013-02-15 14:26:00,163,"Many, many years ago a friend had a cottage on a prime Michigan trout stream. We both had a friend that was a photographer for a MI outdoor program. The camera guy was always invited to come up and fish with a stipulation - leave that camera at home.  Reason, the weekend after a film would be shown there would not be a place to park nor a spot to fish."
768022,kemper,2013-02-15 15:00:00,2232,"I guess I should expand my answer - while I think most spots are not really ""secret"", I don't think spilling the beans on any media outlet is a good idea.  Those of us who fish the East lake O tribs (though I haven't in a while...) know that pressure has increased lately.  There was a small creek that I used to go to with my old man, and on a busy weekend we might run into 3 other guys - the same three guys. It was a well kept secret for a long time, until I assume the use of google earth made it easy for all to find.  One report on this board, by a member who will remain unnamed (I don't think he's active here any longer) that included backgrounds and the next weekend I pulled up to see over 20 cars.  Those who know what I'm talking about, know what I'm talking about. I did make the mistake of introducing a couple friends to the creek, and I can only hope that they didn't contribute to the madness.  Now you are lucky to fish it with less than 20 others, and on such a small system with so many bagged fish I don't imagine it will be around for too long."
768024,Harrison,2013-02-15 15:03:00,2202,"My bro and I did it.  IT is very easy for ""newer"" folks to this game to be taken advantage of.  There is nothing wrong with being ""wide eyed"", enthusiastic and full of dreams. However, as with any industry there are those that will prey on it  I am actually glad for the experience, it opened my eyes the reality of this biz."

768078,Handlebarz,2013-02-15 20:22:00,3790,Depending on the body of water I would. If it was a small lake most Likley not but on lsc I would as it would be hard for people to figure out as it all looks the same. I would not want to share the GPS cords on the show.  I had a friend and his wife get freaked on by a very well know fishing pro. They were fishing a body of water he guides on and fishes alot they caught some nice musky he came over and flipped his lid saying they were on his spot. These two fish all over from lsc to PQ and always find fish but this day was ruined by one person who thought he owned the water. It does show no matter how many times we go to our hunny hole one day some one might be there by accident or by the same luck we had finding it.
768079,jedimaster,2013-02-15 20:34:00,3472,"There is a spot I was trying to keep secret, but I thought long and hard and decided its best to let others try. There is a rock you can stand on if you wade out. here are the co-ords to the rock. Just fan cast in every direction until you hook the big one. 43° 4'37.02""N 79° 4'29.75""W  The water in this area is a bit rough so if you get yourself in any danger, death, dismemberment, drowning etc... its all on you."

767736,Tayzak15,2013-02-14 05:54:00,318,I'd have no problem telling people where my honeyhole is. I just would tell them where to go once they're in the river. I'd warn them its very rocky and you have to know exactly where they would have to go in the river if they don't want to lose their prop. If they can make it there unscathed they deserve to fish there just as much as I do lol.

Some spots I'm taking to the grave ...... I spent half my life way before GPS and graphs and Internet finding theses spots the old fashioned way by reading paper maps and trial and error and actually putting in the leg work and slugging to get these spots !!!!! Now people can just go online and think they can just ask for the info and spots without doing all their homework !!!!!!!!!!

767747,Musky or Specks,2013-02-14 12:01:00,2710,"I also have a philosophy about secret spots. A secret spot has only you as its friend. Unless you can be there 24/7 when you show up next time it might be gone. Share it as much as you can with many resposible anglers and that way when government/big business try take away your right to fish it/ruin it with economic progress it will have a strong voice. I have seen a few ""secret spots"" dissappear forever because they had no one protecting them"

The host can tell all the great things that will happen for you.  Money talks, they are being paid by many sources and the faster they get footage the more they make.  Most of these host could fined there own fish, maybe take 3-4 days, you come in but a show in the can in 4 hrs. you deserve cash."

Everyone loves to catch and keep 'em, their spots are predicatable and generally don't move off too far year after year.  Then I just found out that basin crappies over the ice are practically 0% survival rates for catch and release for fishing deeper than 25FOW. Glad I wasn't born a crappie... lol.  So hold your crappie spots to your grave! Bass, well general areas aren't too bad... but the specific tree where I like to pluck fish....Good luck. I'm sure my bass spots aren't secrets but I'd like to feel they are."

I don't watch or care about TV or anyone on it .... but if someone offered me big money to give up a great spot ..... of course I'd do it.  And so would every single one of you guys who said you wouldn't.  I'd take the money and have a blast fishing new and different water to find fresh spots.  Does everyone really just sit off the same rocky point all the time and catch the same fish over and over.  Of course not.  There is WAY too much water for a single spot to be all that important.  If we are talking really big money ($25k or more) then it would be foolish not to take it."
767833,mike rousseau,2013-02-14 18:42:00,4661,I've shared plenty of my spots... But I still have some that are family only spots...  Also... I had a local guy out one time... I took him to 20+ walleye spots that day....we caught plenty of fish... 2 weeks later he called me up admitting that he tried to find the spots and the ones he found he tried to fish... He didn't catch a thing...  So just because someone finds a spot from another angler... That doesn't mean they will be as successful there....
767862,misfish,2013-02-14 20:47:00,29133,"I share with those I trust,and those that will return the favor. If asked not to take anyone to a spot,it,s a done deal. To me,it,S about respect,and maybe, a new spot for me to go,if allowed.   I do remember once,when I was doing the CFT pro/am,I took a pro to one of my spots.  I kinda got told,in not so nice way after,,NEVER TELL THOSE GUYS ANYTHING.  LOL  What did I know,I just wanted to get fish in the boat,cuz,we had none after 6 hours on the water.  ."
767866,craigdritchie,2013-02-14 21:12:00,1586,"It's kind of a moot point isn't it? I mean, any spot will only be good when you're there at the right time of day, right time of year, and in the right weather conditions. And, if you're using the right stuff.  Telling someone a spot may give them a piece of the puzzle, but it's only one piece. That alone won't put any fish in their boat."
767655,jedimaster,2013-02-14 00:58:00,3472,Purely hypothetical but lets say you were approached by your favorite TV show about a secret fishing hole and they wanted to do a show and put you on tv with your fishing hero. The catch is you would have to be willing to cough up your most secret and prized fishing hole.  Would you do it?
