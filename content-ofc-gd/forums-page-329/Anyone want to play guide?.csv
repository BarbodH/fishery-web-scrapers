767638,Handlebarz,2013-02-13 23:38:00,3790,Like Ron I'm a little out of range to help out.
767940,Sinker,2013-02-15 02:41:00,8692,"Well, maybe if you mentioned where you planned on fishing, or at least. What you intend to catch, someone might chime in with help.  Napane....you have quinte, and beaver lake to the north. Both have walleye and pike.  GL!  S."
767958,moxie,2013-02-15 04:20:00,1566,More info on another site related to the area but out of respect to OFC I will defer from posting. Check your pm's.

768257,Sinker,2013-02-16 17:11:00,8692,"Actually conditions on quinte aren't too bad. A lot of the snow. Was knocked down, some slush made its way to the surface and refroze. I was there on wed and it was easy walking and dragging my clam. Any snow that's left is hard, and the bare spots are slippery. I was wishing I had my cleats.  S."
