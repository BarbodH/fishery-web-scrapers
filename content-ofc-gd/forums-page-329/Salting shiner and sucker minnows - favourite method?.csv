766974,JoshS,2013-02-11 20:30:00,729,"I've have just over a dozen big pike-size shiner and sucker minnows on their way out. I've done some research and there are so many different methods to salting. What's your favourite technique for salting big bait?   Also, does anyone know where to buy large frozen cisco's in the GTA? I used to buy bags in quebec but cannot find them anywhere! Hit a ton of supermarkets, fish stores and asked around... nothing yet..."
766983,fish_fishburn,2013-02-11 20:38:00,1311,"Place your bait in a zip lock bag and add course salt, kosher or sea salt preferred. Place in a cool area. In 24 hours pour off all the liquid that has been drawn out by the salt and replenish with more fresh salt. You cant use to much salt. Put in the fridge or freezer until ready to use. Thats it. Been doing it this way for years and it works good."
767000,Christopheraaron,2013-02-11 20:59:00,3525,"I just throw them in a container full of kosher salt, close it up, shake and keep them in there until you want to use them. As for the cisco, no clue, but if you are ok with smaller minnows there are whole smelts at highland farms, at least when I was there."
767001,JoshS,2013-02-11 21:00:00,729," Thanks. Tried few like this last night and they're draining as we speak. Put them in a ziplock full of salt and hung outside with holes in the bottom to drain. I'm guessing when freezing, the salt prevents them from freezing completely and becoming mush when defrosting..  I was considering this method: http://www.lakemichiganangler.com/tips/general/how_to_make_salted_minnows.htm But seems a little overkill."
767005,Christopheraaron,2013-02-11 21:04:00,3525,"If you have the time, those look way better than mine"
767349,Pikeslayer8,2013-02-12 22:14:00,336,"I just put the frisky live minnows in a gallon ziplock with the course salt and into the fridge overnight.  I separate into smaller batches to pop into the freezer.  The difference in what I do is I add granulated garlic and anise extract to the course salt mixture.  My next batch just might have some Gulp Alive juice as well.  A virtual  ""smorgasbord"" of attractants."
767740,Rich,2013-02-14 10:57:00,3927,"Salt in a ziploc bag. If you're doing big bait, you really cant over salt. I have bags of shads that look like bags of clumped salt... Shake em up and sure enough there's shads in there. Haha"
767800,4x4bassin,2013-02-14 16:26:00,1025,"I use this method and it works great , the only difference is that I put live minnows into the brine solution first . The minnows seem to cure a bit better when they are salted from ""fresh"" and they will last at least a year in the freezer !"
767811,Burtess,2013-02-14 17:20:00,901," I just use the frozen Portuguese sardines for pike, you can get them at most grocery stores (except Metro it seems).  Burt"
768057,JoshS,2013-02-15 17:40:00,729,Thanks for this tips. I did up a batch a few nights ago and popped into the fridge for this weekend... let's hope they get eaten!!
768432,Dabluz,2013-02-17 17:30:00,701,I have a question.  Do you get more bites when using salted minnows or unsalted?
768463,BigBry,2013-02-17 19:52:00,21,thats how I always have done mine. Works great
