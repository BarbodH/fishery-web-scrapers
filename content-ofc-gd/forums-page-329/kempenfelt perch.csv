I know where the lakers are and just wondering as I wanted to keep a little one busy but also try my luck at some more lakers and keep the travelling to a minimum, especially having to cart a 6yr old."

If you go out from Minets Point you don't have to go far to be in 70 plus feet of water. I've caught whitefish out from there but not lake trout, but I haven't fished it much so take that for what that may be worth."
768345,Cudz,2013-02-17 02:03:00,2652,In the bay the perch temd to be shallower.  20-35 ft but I have caught perch out in shanty bay at 50 in 100 foot of water.
768349,dhickey,2013-02-17 02:27:00,1038,The perch are everywhere. If you dont want to go to far then I would say just south of Fox island...  Don.
768350,dylan21,2013-02-17 02:33:00,22,thanks for the input. BTW does anyone know the conditions in the Minets Point area?
768375,Cudz,2013-02-17 04:23:00,2652,My guess would be that they are good conditions. They just held a big tourney west of Minets today. I think they drilled over 500 holes.
