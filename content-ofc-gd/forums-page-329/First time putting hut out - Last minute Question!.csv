There will be at least 8"" of crusty snow, and likely another few inches of powder where I want to put my hut.  Gunna leave it there till the end of the season.  Should I shovel down to the ice.  Then block the hut up on the ice.  Or just block the hut up on top of the snow, then bank the walls with snow?  My concern is for the ease of removal in a few weeks.  The hut will be anchored well, so I'm not worried about that.  I just don't want a real   of a time getting it out at the end of the year.  Any advice?"

The biggest concern may be if you are going to drill holes inside for fishing. Just be sure hut is up high enough so that the slush and water from drilling the inside holes does not freeze it in. Mine is only up on 4x4's now."
768567,fishindevil,2013-02-18 12:05:00,6254,It always seems you can never have enough blocks and when you thinks its hacked up enough put another block under it !!!! Many years of that crap fighting the slush and having them freeze in !!! It's never ending !!!!! Lots of fun if you get a thaw then a freeze again try to pick a high spot on the ice if you can its all trial and error some winters were great some were constantly baby sitting the hut and jacking it up
768568,NAW,2013-02-18 12:13:00,4022,Thanks for the quick replies Gents.!  I'm off!
768571,fishindevil,2013-02-18 12:27:00,6254,Remember you can't have enough blocks !!!! You will be thankful when it's time to remove the hut !!! Lol... Some guys have their huts 2ft off the ice !!!! It's safer to be too high as opposed to being froze in !!! Good luck have fun !!!! And catch some fish ... Cheers

The styrofoam is the heat break,  it really slows down the sinking process.  In case you're worried that it will compress, it doesn't unless your hut weighs a ton."
