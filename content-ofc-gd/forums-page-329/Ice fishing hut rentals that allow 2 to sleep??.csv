Im routing thru alot of outfitters, but alot offer up the cottage/hut or the bigger ice bungalows which 2 of us dont want. Im gonna continue to look, but thought I'd ask someone whos been there done that. Nippising, Kawarthas, Simcoe, BOQ dosent really matter. I remember reading a few years back or maybe last year about Scugog, but havent come across any in my serch yet. Im gonna continue to hunt, but thoght I'd ask. Thanks Greg."
