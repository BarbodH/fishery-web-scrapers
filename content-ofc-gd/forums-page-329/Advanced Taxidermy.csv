766869,Joey,2013-02-11 05:44:00,9122,Very cool!  Nice work for sure!
766951,dheitzner,2013-02-11 19:43:00,314,"Looks great, I've always liked the bear skin rugs!"
766962,GreenCanada,2013-02-11 20:01:00,375,Everyone who is in the neighbourhood should drop in and check out their showroom. Easily the best quality products I've seen.
766967,Andrew Grant,2013-02-11 20:16:00,201,.
766969,Loadman,2013-02-11 20:23:00,63,or just go to BPS.... that is all theirs if I am not mistaken
767052,BucktownAngler,2013-02-11 23:06:00,582,care to share what something like that costs?
767060,SBCregal,2013-02-11 23:19:00,688,their booth at the sportsman show was fantastic.  they do great work.  nice rug!!
767074,iFish4real,2013-02-12 00:05:00,386,yep...I'm curious too
767084,pidge,2013-02-12 00:26:00,438,"That looks amazing, way cool. Is it wrong to wana drape that over me and scare people?lol."
767162,Handlebarz,2013-02-12 01:54:00,3790,Actually most of there stuff at BPS is hard to tell as when BPS orders from them they get the mounts in and then have there own painters dull the fish to make them look old and not out do the other mounts. Yes this info comes right from them.  The bear looks great they sure do awesome work. I will be getting a musky done this year I hope.  Stop by my booth at the muskies Canada odyssey to check out one of our own OFC's musky mounts I can't wait to see it.
767211,BruceCfisher86,2013-02-12 04:56:00,49,I can't wait to try that!
767214,BruceCfisher86,2013-02-12 05:04:00,49,"Your lookin at around $1350 bucks! I never got the official weight of the bear, but it was roughly 300 lbs. The price varies depending on how big the bear is. You definatly pay a little more, and it took a year, but it is truly one of the most badass rugs ever ha ha! Can't say enough good things about Advanced Taxidermy."
767221,Moosebunk,2013-02-12 07:56:00,3970,"Awesome!  The work in the head is really impressive.  They are ""Advanced"" Taxidermy for a reason.  Was happy with my speckled trout too... and looking forward to having them do the wife's Arctic char one day."
767246,Jay T,2013-02-12 13:53:00,282,"Congrats on the bear. Sure they do good work, but I had mine done by a guy for less than half of that and it looks identical. He does great work and a lot cheaper. If you have pets don't have that rug on the floor!"
767253,LucG,2013-02-12 14:47:00,779,"Nice rug mount, the taxidermist did an excellent job!"
767254,Lunkerhunter,2013-02-12 14:48:00,455,i have had 3 mounts done by advanced. 2 of the 3 are complete and look amazing. currently waiting for my 55 inch muskie to be completed and cant wait to see the final product.  i also have to agree that the showroom is pretty awesome!
767255,LucG,2013-02-12 14:49:00,779," I tried that in front of my dog, the hair stood straight up on his back, and he growled like I never heard before. I immediatly removed the rug from my back lol"
767297,BruceCfisher86,2013-02-12 18:01:00,49,"Ya I'm learning that now, hard to keep the hair off!"
767298,BruceCfisher86,2013-02-12 18:02:00,49,I want to try that on the wife when she falls asleep on the couch! ha ha
767706,bucktail,2013-02-14 03:13:00,1857,"Spend the extra and get themto do your work, I have 3 fish and my 155 buck, flawless. You cant appreciate it till you get it back!"
767708,kemper,2013-02-14 03:17:00,2232,"Cool work, but I have to be honest...I can't imagine any reason I would want a bear rug on my floor."
767783,craigdritchie,2013-02-14 15:02:00,1586," I couldn't agree more. Advanced did a large steelhead for me about 12 years ago and even though James and Shawn would probably say their word has improved since, I still think it looks totally amazing. It's truly a piece of art ..... you can't put a value on that."
767857,Grimace,2013-02-14 20:22:00,2020,I got them to do a big Pike for me about 10 years ago and it was awesome.  Charged me less than what he quoted because he said he got a great deal on his last shipment of supplies.  The pike still looks mint.  Great work.
767877,misfish,2013-02-14 22:13:00,29133, I can think of one.  Real nice work.
