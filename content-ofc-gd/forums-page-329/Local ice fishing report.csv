Started out by an island and gradually worked my way out to the main basin, not even a fish marked so didn't set the hut up.  Settled in an area of about 9-10 foot of water where I marked a couple fish.  Next couple of hours was a bunch of these:   And quite a few of these:   A small pike too...  Then there was a lull in the action...... thats when I caught this lady, a good size for this location:   All fish were released to fight another day (and as are the rules here).  Beat going to the movies like the rest of the family lol.....   Burt"

768474,Burtess,2013-02-17 20:06:00,901," I jig with my ultralight for the panfish, and usually set a tip-up with a big sardine if there are pike in the area.  Paid off this time.   I took him last weekend and we got skunked.  I am going to head up to Simcoe this Wednesday to scout out the action, and am going to bring him up the next weekend or so.  Burt"
