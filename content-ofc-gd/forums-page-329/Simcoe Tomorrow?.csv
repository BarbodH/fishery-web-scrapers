I've never caught a laker or whitefish ever so I'm itching to catch my first of either.  On the other hand I'm more certain then not I can find the jumbo perch in my favorite perch spot.  I have to walk out and don't mind a bit of a hike.  It takes about a steady 35 - 40 minutes to walk to my perch spot.  What are you guys ( whoever is going to be out there ) going to be trying for?  I'm thinking my best bet for lakers is maybe BBP?  I've fished there before but not for a couple years.  Cheers,  Tony  "

768536,tapout,2013-02-18 01:38:00,166,I tried off Big Bear Point today without any luck.  Not so much as a sniff.  I pretty much brought my minnows for a swim it seems.  Now I have a bunch of minnows still so am going to try my luck at Virginia Beach tomorrow for some perch.  Hopefully a pike comes by for a visit as well.  Anyone else going to be there?
