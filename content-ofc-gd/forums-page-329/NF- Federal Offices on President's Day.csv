I was planning to head to the office in Niagara Falls, New York on Monday.  I just realized that it is President's Day on Monday.  I did a search on Google and found some information that indicating that federal offices are close on Washington's birthday (Feb 22) instead of President's Day.  Does anyone know for certain if federal office in New York state will be open on Monday?         "
