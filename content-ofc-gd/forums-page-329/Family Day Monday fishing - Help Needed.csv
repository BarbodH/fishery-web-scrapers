767955,woodro,2013-02-15 03:53:00,168,"Hey guys, I'm planning to take my girlfriend and her younger cousins fishing this family day Monday but I'm not exactly sure how I'm going to get them to decent fishing grounds for perch without a long exhausting walk. (they're 4 and 8 years old)  Would anyone be willing to drive us (5 ppl) out on cooks bay and drive us back for $50?"
767962,adempsey,2013-02-15 05:01:00,1498,I am sure one of the operators would take you out.  There are a couple operating out of there.
767977,woodro,2013-02-15 11:18:00,168, Do you if there's an operator off the Keswick side?
768016,icedude,2013-02-15 14:26:00,459,  woodro and ice kidz crew-Keswick Inquiry   maybe Rick Arsenault--google him  not sure if Rick is in your price range though  Busy times  Family Day Weekend Monday as i'm sure you can appreciate  Only operator i would endorse in that Keswick area personally  Have a Blast--Stay Safe   Paul  'Take A Kid Fishing'
768050,woodro,2013-02-15 16:54:00,168," Thanks for the response icedude, I can pay more for the lift out if someone is willing to do it.  Rick is a great guy, I use to rent boats off him years ago. He has since shut down Simcoe Fishing Adventures though. He moved further north to Weslemkoon and started another operation."
