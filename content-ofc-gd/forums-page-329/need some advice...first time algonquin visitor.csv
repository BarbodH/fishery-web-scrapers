Of all my years camping and fishing in that area i have never been to Algonquin. So we are going to slip away for a few days from Restoule and would like car camp in one of the campgrounds in the park. If we book now looks like we could get a descent waterfront site in some of the campgrounds. I will bring along my scanoe with 5 hp,and probably the kayak. I will be fishing while there,species are not really important but some brook trout would be great as well bass and pike. Wildlife viewing is also a big feature,moose,wolves,bears,etc...love to take some photos with the dslr nikon. So if anyone could reccommend a campground it would be much appreciated. I was looking at the one near Kiosk but herd it is very busy with water traffic compared to some others. How about Pog and Kearney ,Tea,Canisbay or Mew?  Also can I use my 16 ft boat /w 70 hp on some of the lakes that have under 20 and 10 restrictions if I only use my 5 hp kicker or bow mount? thanks again"

My personal choice for car camping would be at Brent, also on the north side. Main reason being the campsites are very nice and Cedar lake is a big beautiful lake with good fishing for smallmouth, walleye and lakers. There are a couple of adjacent portage lakes with good brookie fishing. If you're interested pm me.  Yes, you can use your larger boat with the 5 horse kicker. Just don't get caught firing up the big motor.  If you're interested in using your big motor, Opeongo lake along the hwy 60 corridor is open to unlimited horespower. No, there is no car campgrounds on Opeongo. But you can drive right up to the launch and park right there. There's all kinds of beautiful campsites on Opeongo and some great beaches as well. If you needed anything you could always zoom back to the landing, there's a store there along with shower and washroom facilities."
