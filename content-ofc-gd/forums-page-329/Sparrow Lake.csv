767878,dheitzner,2013-02-14 22:17:00,314,"Never really hit it through the ice, but I'm sure someone on here can give you some info on it..."
767914,Joey,2013-02-15 01:03:00,9122,"Fished Sparrow a few years in a row through the ice, never had any luck!  Lockjaw was the word most used"
767920,skdds,2013-02-15 01:32:00,195,"...Thanks for the replies,...does not sound to encouraging . I wonder why its not a productive lake? -skdds"
767934,Joey,2013-02-15 02:24:00,9122, Overfished and currents!
767935,sauce,2013-02-15 02:25:00,219,"It probably is a productive lake. But like most ""honey holes"" people that know like to keep it quiet. I have never fished it but its on my list. Give it a shot. Is the water clear? Maybe the fish are more nocturnal..."
767948,skdds,2013-02-15 03:07:00,195,"Good  ideas will try different times of the day, ...not sure if fished too hard in the winter and don't know much about clarity either. I did not think of currents being a prob? as I've fished other trent severn lakes..  -skdds"
767960,rdambros,2013-02-15 04:30:00,71,"Don't bother. All the outfitters have left the lake for a reason. Only the Bayview Resort is left and they only put out a few huts. Fished it last year from morning to night. Move about 6 times and caught nothing. Didn't even get a mark on the sonar or see anything on the underwater camera. I had heard there were some crappies through the ice, but not when I was there.  If you go there is a public parking at the launch on the north side of the lake, but I don't remember the name of the road.  Good luck and post if you go."
