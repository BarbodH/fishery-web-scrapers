768321,BigBry,2013-02-16 23:04:00,21,they clean shimano reels as well?
768322,MCTFisher9120,2013-02-16 23:05:00,3761," Shimano does and they do a good job, $25 fee unless it's a Stella, then your covered for life on cleanings.  Mike"
768325,Steve,2013-02-16 23:23:00,2075,"anyone have experience doing cleanings for both spinning / trolling reels, including changing drag washers / drags where required?  i have about 40 something reels that I would like to get done, however, I'd prefer not to send them out... it would also be a great opportunity for me to learn....I would like to pay hourly. It likely would take a full day to do all the reels.  I'm in Hamilton.  90% of the reels are shimano. half of the reels are tekota's.  thanks"
768412,BigBry,2013-02-17 15:43:00,21, Not sure what your saying here Mike?
768418,BigBry,2013-02-17 16:20:00,21,"I asked do they service shimano and he write backs.....Shimano does and they do a good job.. implying that shimano cleans shimano reels.. You can see how most people would wonder. I just would have said... Yup they do shimano as well, and do a great job.. Kinda like what I said lol"
768425,uglyfish,2013-02-17 16:45:00,981,shimano reels can be sent to the head office in peterborough for an service. they dropped aikmans as a service center due to the poor customer service they had.
768431,BigBry,2013-02-17 17:28:00,21,good to know.. I have actually heard alot of bad this about Aikmans since inquiring.. Thanks.. Anybody ever hear of classic Sports for reel cleaning and repairs?
768464,BigBry,2013-02-17 19:53:00,21,Aikmans do repairs as well?
768508,buckster,2013-02-17 23:06:00,530,Angling specialties also does reel cleaning if I'm not mistaken.
