768149,Fisherman,2013-02-16 02:19:00,7201,Yessir.
768151,limeyangler,2013-02-16 02:22:00,5204,Thanks man.
768154,BillM,2013-02-16 02:30:00,17367,"I was going to print out that same pass for this weekend, except I blew the top end in my Indy 550 today, lol!"
768168,limeyangler,2013-02-16 03:29:00,5204,  DOH! Hate when that happens!
768178,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-16 04:06:00,10439, Get a 4 stroke and that won't happen.
768194,NAW,2013-02-16 13:06:00,4022,"crappy new Bill!  I printed my free pass yesterday.  Gunna give the trails a shot around her.  Only problem is, my buddies with sleds are running Rev 1000's..  No friggen way I'll be able to keep up"
768195,Terry,2013-02-16 13:09:00,14456,"there are speed limits on the trails, so keeping up should be easy"
768201,limeyangler,2013-02-16 14:16:00,5204,I hit some sections of trails on my fishing trips. I definitely feel safer coming home when its dark....at least there is the chance i might see the headlights of the oncoming #@#%$#@ doing 90mph! Certainly wont be any warning before its too late during daylight hours.
768251,BillM,2013-02-16 16:52:00,17367," Nah, I'll just have a $1000 repair bill instead of a $100 top end kit     I'll stick to the 2-smoke!"
768331,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-17 00:01:00,10439, Fixed it for ya Bill!!
