768561,irishfield,2013-02-18 04:40:00,26272,You'll need a bill of sale for the boat.. or you'll have to go to a Notary and get a declaration signed and sealed.  All applications go to NB...  http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety/debs-obs-paperwork-paperwork_boat_licence-1898.htm
768563,Lunatic,2013-02-18 05:38:00,536,"as usual,jumping thru endless hoops to go nowhere. i looked at the documents.i have no idea where my bill of sale is from an old tin boat i purchased years ago,that has no ID tags or anything to suggest what make model or year it is. its times like these when i would rather scrub off the 20 and put in 9.9 on the motor cover. sigh..."
768564,moxie,2013-02-18 05:57:00,1566,"I purchased an old tinny years back and couldn't find the bill of sale. I went to a Notary(court house or law firm) as described above and signed a declaration, made a donation of $10 and had it sealed. The next step was to take the declaration to a Canada Customs office and apply for a vessel permit and I believe it cost an additional $10 at that time. The last step is to purchase letters and numbers and affix them to the hull. Not that big a deal if you do some leg work on the internet before hand. Good luck."

If you are not comfortable doing this, give the boat to your neighbour for free and buy it back and get him to give you a bill of sale!!"

768640,Lunatic,2013-02-18 20:41:00,536,this is what will most likely happen.
768641,Lunatic,2013-02-18 20:41:00,536,like most things these days
