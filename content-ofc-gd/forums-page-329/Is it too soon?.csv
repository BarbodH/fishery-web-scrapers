768129,dheitzner,2013-02-16 01:01:00,314," Thanks man, definitely some bruisers in this thread!!! Caught quite a few nice bags in Sept over the years... I'd say overall it's likely my favorite month to fish."

768254,Sinker,2013-02-16 17:05:00,8692,Omg......waaaay Too early!!  Bass =  Barf!!  At least real fish with teeth can be caught thru a hole in the ice!!  S.
767970,kemper,2013-02-15 05:47:00,2232,"Sorry ice guys, this weather is killing me.  Anyone else dying for bass season...    Let's see 'em.  Nothing like Lady Buckhorn in the evening  "
767973,lickmyarmpit,2013-02-15 09:16:00,359,I couldn't agree more even though I'm going ice fishing this weekend.  I got a new toy and can't wait to get out in her.....bring on the spring.
767982,Rich,2013-02-15 12:25:00,3927,"I can wait for bass, but I've definitely just about had enough ice fishing!"
767983,Nipfisher,2013-02-15 12:25:00,2449,Beauty boat. What are you powering her with? Got a name for the rig yet?
767986,bigugli,2013-02-15 12:47:00,6138,"Haven't got my fiil of icefishing yet. Then again, I never got my fill of softwater last year either."
767987,LucG,2013-02-15 12:53:00,779,"I feel ya! As much as I love ice fishing, and winter in general, I've had enough and can't wait for open water!  "
767991,Rod Caster,2013-02-15 13:04:00,5784,"Luc, you disapoint me  I think there's a half million dollar two bedroom bungalow in Vaughn calling your name.  Buck up boys, lots of ice and time left. Use your imagination...and I'm not talking about switching from a white to a chartreuse spinnerbait."

768007,kemper,2013-02-15 14:04:00,2232,"Something about staring down a small hole in the ice doesn't do much for me.  That said, I'm going to entertain myself with some perch on Sunday and Simcoe lakers on monday"
768010,Luke V.,2013-02-15 14:05:00,286,I don't Mind catching theseBut I wanna be catching more of these
768011,Harrison,2013-02-15 14:07:00,2202,"When I opened this thread a memory popped into my head of a day prefishing for a T with my late Dad.  We were in an area that had big fish written all over it... I flipped in and I saw her turn on the jig.  I would of shook her off but I knew my Dad would of loved to see a nice fish.  He took this pic with an old 35mm a few years ago...probably 12 or so now. Funny how I used to remember the day for the size of fish that were caught, now I could careless about that.  Scugog  Never to early to think BASS!"
768013,SlowPoke,2013-02-15 14:12:00,2984,"Bass season? Wow, you guys are patient. I will have been fishing soft water for two and a half months before you're on the water.... Just six more weeks and the boat and truck comes out of storage  "
768014,kemper,2013-02-15 14:15:00,2232," Great story!  Most of my best fishin' memories are with the old man as well. The bass in the picture I posted was taken on the last day of a very tough week.  On the water for 5 days in the worst weather imaginable, catching small bass here and there and freezing to the bone. The last day the weather finally broke, and that one took a white spinnerbait crashed into the shore in about 1FOW.  It was on my line, but I think my old man might have been more excited than I was..."
768015,Joeytier,2013-02-15 14:24:00,3990,Short answer:  Yes...too soon indeed
768020,Acountdeleted,2013-02-15 14:48:00,2562,"Waaaay too soon.  I love bass, probably my favourite fish. I love the way they look, the fight, the way they hit. The ease or difficulty of hooking into them depending on the day.  ....... But right now the lake trout are calling."
768035,MCTFisher9120,2013-02-15 15:45:00,3761,"It's been a little while since the end of last September when I was chasing largies, can't wait to get out on opener in June. Booked a cottage for a solid week starting on opening day should be a blast. Always look forward to the annual August camping trip, were doing a 2 week trip this summer. Hope to catch a few monsters this summer!    And Another   120 days left"

768037,Rod Caster,2013-02-15 15:46:00,5784," If I see a guy staring down a hole for an extended period of time I check to see if he didn't accidentally drown himself, and if he's ok, I stick a perch in his pocket."
768038,lew,2013-02-15 15:50:00,12766," That's a great motor, your gonna be very happy with  it !!"
768040,lickmyarmpit,2013-02-15 15:57:00,359,
768048,lew,2013-02-15 16:36:00,12766," Don't worry about trolling too long with the 4 stroke, you'll be able to go all day and when you hit the throttle it'll be instant response, unlike a 2 stroke that can bog down after awhile.  I don't know what trolling speeds you'll be looking for but if you want to slow way down you can always drag a drift sock or something similar. Mine would get down to around 2 1/2 MPH but that was about it."
768049,SlowPoke,2013-02-15 16:38:00,2984,You will always benefit from a kicker motor... - auxiliary power source. - more precise low speed control. - reduces wear/maintenance on your main motor. Your main motor being a four stroke should have no issue with extended periods of idling/trolling but may suffer a little in the speed control department.
