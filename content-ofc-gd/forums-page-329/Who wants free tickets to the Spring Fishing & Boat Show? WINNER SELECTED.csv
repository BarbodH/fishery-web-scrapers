So we decided to give away a couple sets of passes.  There are two ways to enter:  1 - 2 tickets will be given away to an OFC member. All you have to do is just reply to this thread. We will draw a winner on Thursday.  2 - 2 tickets will be given away via our Facebook page . You will have to ""Like"" our page and share the picture that is posted on your wall.   We will also be giving away a prize pack full of gear. You will just need to fill out a ballot at the show.  Please visit us (Me, The Urban Fisherman, Frankie65, FisherJuli, SRT8 and others) at booth #1723 in the main hall.   I expect to see a lot of old friends and make some new ones."
