765671,BruceCfisher86,2013-02-06 05:56:00,49,Anyone own a Lund Fury?  Just lookin for some reviews!!
765687,doubleheader,2013-02-06 12:38:00,497,"Try Walleye Central's Boat forum, there have been numerous posts over the last yeat on this boat. http://www.walleyecentral.com/"
765706,Cosmos,2013-02-06 15:20:00,588,Friend of mine has one. Bought it last year. It's really nice boat.
765710,BruceCfisher86,2013-02-06 15:38:00,49,"Thanks, I'll definatly check it out!"
765711,BruceCfisher86,2013-02-06 15:39:00,49, Sweet! does he have the tiller or the SS. I might break down and buy one ha ha
765716,moxie,2013-02-06 15:56:00,1566,There are and will be a lot of good deals on solid used units all the time. Quite a ways to go before the water softens up again. A great time to shop around.
765765,Cosmos,2013-02-06 18:54:00,588,He has a tiller. 25 Merc with power trim and 55 lbs terrova i-pilot.
766008,Sinker,2013-02-07 18:49:00,8692,My hunting partner bought one this year. 16fter with a 40 yammy tiller. Nice rig. I like it.  S.
766100,BruceCfisher86,2013-02-08 00:40:00,49,What about a Lund Alaskan 1800 anyone?
766257,doubleheader,2013-02-08 17:30:00,497,The Alaskan is another really nice rig. I had an 18' Alaskan for a number of years.
766440,BruceCfisher86,2013-02-09 04:22:00,49,Ya they look awesome. I'm looking for a good boat for Lake Huron waters and other lakes! so I'm thinking the Alaskan is a better choice!
766745,Sinker,2013-02-10 18:50:00,8692,"The Alaskans are a little skinny. Check out some other manufactureres. There is a lot more than just Lund out there. Wouldn't be my first choice, thats for sure.  S."

766804,kickingfrog,2013-02-10 23:55:00,8333,I think someone on this board just bought one last year around this time.
766823,John Bacon,2013-02-11 01:05:00,3277,The console version of the boat was at the Sportsman show today.  Perhaps it will be at the show next weekend too.  It looked like a well laid out boat.  The layout was actually quite similar to my old Alumacraft Lunker 16.  The Fury had a nicer finish though.
768174,Tim Mills,2013-02-16 03:47:00,476,Saw the fury at the show.  I liked the rear seats that fold down and convert into a casting deck.
