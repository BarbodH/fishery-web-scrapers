768403,Burtess,2013-02-17 14:36:00,901,On Wednesday I will make my first trip to Simcoe for lakers.  We will be walking out so close to deep water is good.  Looks like we will either go out from Line 2 in Oro or from Tyndale Park on the other side closer to the base of the bay.  How is parking at these locations and which would you go for the best chance of action?  Or any other suggestions for location?  Thanks!! Burt
