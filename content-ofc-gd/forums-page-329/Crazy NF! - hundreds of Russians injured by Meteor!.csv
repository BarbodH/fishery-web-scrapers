767992,Rod Caster,2013-02-15 13:08:00,5784,Watching the CBC report as we speak. Wild stuff. I wonder how the super religious feel about stuff like this? God skipping stones or something?
767993,Lunker777,2013-02-15 13:11:00,866,WOW
767995,Rich,2013-02-15 13:22:00,3927,ALIEN INVASION!!
767997,LucG,2013-02-15 13:27:00,779,"Definitly pretty crazy!  Also read this:  What will happen tonight? Just before 7.30pm today, a 150ft wide chunk of space rock will whizz past us in the closest shave since records began. If it hit the planet, it could wipe out a city the size of London and do as much damage as 1,000 of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima. Nasa has stressed that ‘no Earth impact is possible’ – but scientists say there is a small chance that TV signals may be affected. The asteroid will cut through the orbit of some satellites used for weather forecasting and for satellite phones and television. Mobile phones won’t be affected as they rely on land-based masts and cables. Asteroid 2012 DA14 was discovered last year by a Spanish dentist turned amateur astronomer and has been closely tracked ever since. Hurtling through space at speeds of five miles a second, eight times as fast as a speeding bullet, it will come within 17,000 miles of Earth at 7.24pm tomorrow. Astronomy expert Daniel Brown, of Nottingham Trent University, said: ‘In astronomical terms, that’s very close.’ Although the asteroid won’t be visible with the naked eye, it should be possible to see it with binoculars."
767999,Oryx,2013-02-15 13:38:00,186,"WOW,  imagine if it was a direct hit instead of exploding. The Tungaska event comes to mind....."
768002,Luke V.,2013-02-15 13:44:00,286,I heard it was going to be close But that's crazy close  Would have been devastating if it held together and hit the earth
768003,Muskieman,2013-02-15 13:47:00,2472,Apparently unrelated to the asteroid ...
768004,Terry,2013-02-15 13:49:00,14456,I think it's all misinformation  Korea couldn't get the rockets to work so now they are tossing big rocks at everyone
