321925,Sinker,2009-03-25 22:53:00,8692,Never had a problem with a dodge!
321956,Mattones,2009-03-25 23:19:00,587,I also love when i pull up beside some nice ladies. I am kidding  Going to look for a bed cover next week.
321961,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-25 23:24:00,260, Wait 'till sunroof/convertible season sunshine  you will never buy a car again for sure.
322006,Mattones,2009-03-26 00:38:00,587, Wonder what I'll do when they look up. haha.  Oh man:D
322008,Maverick,2009-03-26 00:40:00,371," Go with a spray on bed liner, you won't regret it.  oh, bed cover, my bad."
322020,2 tone z71,2009-03-26 00:56:00,1311,tint your windows
322021,2 tone z71,2009-03-26 00:57:00,1311,"got my Extang cver from Van and Truck world was 550 IIRC ,but I got a lil wee box"
322034,Greencoachdog,2009-03-26 01:19:00,8163,"You picked the wrong color Matt!!!  Just remember...  ... the white color is the right color!!!  It's still a good lookin' truck, and I'm sure you'll get many years of enjoyment out of it!!!  Looks like you may want to put some nerf bars on that baby!"
322046,ch312,2009-03-26 01:36:00,1590,sweet ride...im guessing it has the MDS? could ya do me a favor and let me know what kinda mileage you get after shes broke in a bit? im thinking about buying one later this year or next spring.  ive had a dakota for 3 years and i can say one thing...do NOT get a tonneau cover. the hard ones are a pain if you are out and need to put something big in the box. soft ones arent bad in the summer but dont even think about putting it back on in the winter without a sleeping bag and heater to warm it up. you wont realize how much of a pain box covers are until you have one on. a cap is much more practical and makes life a lot easier.  might as well get the bed sprayed if it isnt already. hard box liners wear through paint and even metal in some areas on many vehicles. then theres the rocks that somehow get underneath the liner that put nice dents in the box and cause nice paint chips.
322056,Mattones,2009-03-26 01:52:00,587,They are semi tinted. In time I may consider a darker tint.   I hope to get them put on in the fall. The bed cover in first though I kinda like the little jump in and out. The girlfriend was complaining so i said if you dont like it you can drive your moms car. lol  Funny first day at work with it I put my shoes and jacket in a garbage bag and tossed it in the bed. This truck is going to be as clean as it came out of the factory.  Any idea where i can find rubber floor mats that will fit the truck correctly?
322059,Dutch,2009-03-26 01:53:00,831,Love the truck - they should've filled 'er up for you though.  I bought a GMC Sierra back in August when gas was at $1.40 and they still filled it.
322066,Greencoachdog,2009-03-26 02:04:00,8163," Shop online Matt, there should be a Dodge Truck accessories site."
322071,2 tone z71,2009-03-26 02:20:00,1311,"yeah I told myself that as well ,being in construction its not always easy,there are many great catch all matts out there van and truck world has them as well"
322073,BillM,2009-03-26 02:25:00,17367,"  Spend the money on a pair of WeatherTechs..  You won't find a better floor mat.  I picked up a pair for my S10.. Complete contoured to the exact shape of the footwell, nice and deep for all the snow/mud..  Pricey, but you'll only buy them once."
322077,Mike the Pike,2009-03-26 02:33:00,3421,Well congrats there man nice looking set of wheels.Unfortunately I have the Van on the right of your truck it keeps the peace when travelling with 3 kids. When they grow up I will get my truck
322106,Cudz,2009-03-26 03:27:00,2652,Nice truck. I didn't realize the ram boxes were extra.  Since they advertise them so much I assumed they were standard on all models. wow.  Still nice.  Although the 20 look nicer I think your wheels are much more practical.  My buddy has the 20s on his ram and he has to replace all 4 tires this month (almost $2000 for rubber alone). Is that the regular size of the 4 door cab or is there a bigger one?
322137,John Bacon,2009-03-26 04:16:00,3277," Trillium Pontiac Buick charged my wife $50 for gas in her new car back 2007.  And that's for a Pontiac Wave!!!  I told her to go back and demand compensation, it doesn't even hold 50 worth of gas.  She never bothered though."
322156,limeyangler,2009-03-26 10:00:00,5204,"Made up for ya, buying new is a real buzz, very nice looking truck!  I enjoyed watching your posts, seem to remember you starting off with a used 2wd canyon, boy....you moved up the food chain to a real beast.  Congrats on the new ride."
322159,outllaw,2009-03-26 10:51:00,1232,congrats on a real stump puller. good color it wont show dirt
322175,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-03-26 12:19:00,1362,Nice truck....the only problem I see with your truck is that it's toooooooo clean for a 4x4..ya need to get some mud and a few scratches on her....Have I ever got a nice back woods speckie lake for you to try with your truck   .....I'll bring my tow strap   just in case
322182,cranks bait,2009-03-26 12:39:00,721,"Nice truck Matt.  Extended cab is the way to go for sure.  No sissy jump seat there.  Good choice of colour as well.  You'll never have to wash it.  As for the gas.  Don't worry too much about it.  They either put in in the price of the vehicle and you finance that tank of gas or you go out and buy it yourself.  Either way you pay for it.  Just have to learn how to back up.  Heck you're 10 feet in the air, you should be able to see the rear bumber practically.  The more you drive it, the better you will get.  Don't worry about the gadgets, as you will still run into things if you rely on it.  And be a gentle man.  Get a milk crate for your girlfriend to get in the truck, geezz, is chilvalry dead?  Congrats."
322414,ecmilley,2009-03-26 19:22:00,2163,"nice truck, let us know the real world gas mileage on it have been considering trading the seirra for the new ram but will most likely pick up another seirra (that 402 hp denali sure looks nice)"
322619,Mattones,2009-03-27 02:01:00,587,yeah the ram Boxes would have been a bonus for my tool belt. And my $200 Hammer haha  I just added the mud flaps on yesterday I should get a picture with them. They look ''alright'' A big jump eh! I was told the Canyon eats up too much gas so i figure why not go big. And came across this dodge one night. Went out Staurday morning and bought her.  My girlfriend says I am going to be anal about the inside of the truck staying clean. Hate to admit it but i have put the vacuum to her twice since i got her. haha. I really just want the drivers side mud mats and a seat cover and ill be fine. hehe Already ran her though the mud today at work hehe.   First thing I did when i got home was back her up. i must say backing up this rigg is pretty easy. if not easier then my Mazda 626. I have yet to pull into my driveway facing the house.  Oh for sure!! so far it has been great on gas. Filled up today with a bit more then half a tank. This was after driving it since Tuesday night. In Burlington and at work WalkersLine ->Winston Chruchhill and back.
321859,Mattones,2009-03-25 21:15:00,587,"Went to the Dealer yesterday around 4pm, Signed the rest of the paper work and watched as they finished cleaning my truck. Left around 4:30. (Can't believe they didn't fill my tank. Left me with a 1/4 left.) Putting the mud flaps on tonight as they where on back order.  Anyway here is my truck 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 4x4 5.7 Hemi      The 5.7 HEMI    I can honestly say now that I will never buy a car again. Unless its a lamborghini. Lol"
321860,danbouck,2009-03-25 21:17:00,4380,Nice!
321862,Maverick,2009-03-25 21:20:00,371,Nice lookin beast!  They probably had the tank full but burnt 3/4 of it when they pulled it around front for ya haha!
321865,bassdreamer,2009-03-25 21:24:00,128,Nice looking truck !!!!
321868,misfish,2009-03-25 21:28:00,29133,"DODGE???????????????? Ahhhhhhhhh, ya been brain washed.LOL Nice looking truck. Enjoy yer new ride."
321869,muskeybugged,2009-03-25 21:32:00,282,hahahahahhahahaha!  Nice truck dude!
321872,MCTFisher9120,2009-03-25 21:34:00,3761,That Dodge is sexy...First truck i will get will be a nice Dodge Ram.  Congrads
321873,Radnine,2009-03-25 21:38:00,1538,The way picture posting had gone on the board as of late I am predicting a six page discussion on whether it's a Dodge or not. Jim
321874,GeorgeJ,2009-03-25 21:38:00,207,I love the box mounted tool boxes but keep in mind they prevent you from putting on a cap and certain tonneau covers if that's important to you. Chrysler quit paying for fill ups on new vehicles a couple of months ago but I think the dealer should have adsorbed the cost and delivered it with a full tank.
321875,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-25 21:40:00,10439,   
321877,fishnsled,2009-03-25 21:41:00,3520, I think it's a Ford with Dodge emblems.  Kinda like a tiger muskie.  Congrats on the new ride.
321878,tinbanger,2009-03-25 21:42:00,1028,Nice Enjoy that new truck smell!  TB
321889,Sinker,2009-03-25 22:08:00,8692,There is only one real truck........and you got one Matt!!  Is a dodge for sure!!  Sinker
321891,irishfield,2009-03-25 22:12:00,26272,When you go back for mud flaps.. ask them where your fuel voucher is ! Have NEVER bought a new truck that didn't have a full tank or a voucher to hit a gas station when I left. They come in off the truck almost empty and any good dealer fills the tank to start you off... you shouldn't need to ask. Same deal with my boat...and I laughed hard when he realized it holds 325 litres !
321900,BrownTown,2009-03-25 22:18:00,103,I second the brain washed part!
321903,BUSTER,2009-03-25 22:20:00,1336,"soooo   how good of a deal was it?  nice truck ,by the way"
321906,purekgw,2009-03-25 22:23:00,585,so any burn outs yet lol nice truck in deed
321910,Mattones,2009-03-25 22:35:00,587,"haha no burn outs yet im taking her easy for the 1st 1000kms.  Loving it it death. added the front mud flaps so far will add the backs tonight. The mud flaps are alright looking ill get use to them.  Anyone know how much the dealer wil lcharge to add the back up senser for when your backing up it does you when your getting closer and closer.  I tend to always be 3-4 feet away from the wall when i want to be 2. Just dont wanna dent my crome:P  Bought her for $28,000"
321912,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-25 22:37:00,260,Nice truck  Not filling the gas tank however seems fishy to me  After spending that kind of money it only seems fair leaving with a full tank off the lot.  Front ends now sure look different with that raked forward look.
321913,misfish,2009-03-25 22:37:00,29133," Wayne,stop dating yer age,we know yer another year older.LOL   Yer mudder dropped you on yer head didnt she? LOL All in good fun.  They do make a nice LOOKING truck."
321915,irishfield,2009-03-25 22:39:00,26272,Expecting a full tank of gas is dating my age???
321916,2 tone z71,2009-03-25 22:43:00,1311,"Ford dealer told me a yr ago there gonna drop the fill up due to price of fuel ,price margin blah blah blah,you know there not making any money right hahah,nice truck well done"
321918,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-25 22:47:00,260, Uh  last new big toy we bought in September came with a full tank.  All 120 Litres  Oh and the one before that and the one before that uh oh what was it that Irishfield said now I forget
321923,misfish,2009-03-25 22:49:00,29133," Oh chill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ol fella."
321924,jdmls,2009-03-25 22:53:00,575,sweet ride.... I love the new front end
