That's not what I'm talking about, so anyone who brought that up is obviously trying to pick a fight where there isn't one.  I'll continue to believe that pictures of live, healthy fish which were potentially released look better than pictures that show dead or possibly needlessly stressed fish.  Take a look at any decent fishing magazine and it will be obvious most of their editors tend to agree with me.  I'm aware fishing is inherently harmful to fish...and I accept that.  I know I am guilty of harming and killing them, and other than trying to minimize the effects...I'm OK with that.  I've enjoyed a fish fry or two in my time, I can assure you.  It's just I feel pics that show fish being harvested are not as appealing as those that do not.  Simple as that.   Tight lines to those that agree and those that do not."

This is also on a body of water that has gazillions of derby's/tourny's every year and the population just keeps increasing in numbers and size.

Anyway, this post may seem antagonizing to you, but it I did have a point to make...oh yeah here it is:  Some anglers only practice catch & release, others harvest everything within their limits, some people flyfish and others only chase Musky...we are all different yet we all share the same passion for the excitement these scaled critters bring us.

You stress a fish and it will still swim away BUT could is more prone to infection later.    I don't like bass tournaments....but at the same time, they do more good than harm (lots of $$ generated for the sport, raising awareness, etc).  For the most part i'm sure everyone here is a conservationist first and there is no ill intent.    We're also (for the most part) experienced enough to know that old/big bass taste like crap (relative to th smaller ones) so i doubt the fish are being slaughtered.....more likley just pics, at the cost of a little extra stress to the fish."

In some situations I think its actually a good thing to keep a fish in the livewell for a while to let it get its strength back up before you release it. Maybe you should stop looking at peoples fishing posts because you might see a pic of a poor fish being held out of the water OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
322319,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-03-26 17:07:00,0,"certainly some of us adopt a predominantly catch and release way of fishing, but it is well within the rights of those anglers to keep table fare. the question is, should it be within the rights of anglers to be keeping all of the best broodstock?  it hasn't worked out for us so far?"
322322,The Urban Fisherman,2009-03-26 17:10:00,2050," Hey a fellow Sudburian!  Born and raised in sudbury here - did most of my smallie fishing in Wanapetei, The West Arm, and Nepewassi.

I agree that the P3TA jokes may have been a little over the top, but just take it with a grain of salt.  Like some people said, different strokes for different folks.  I respect the fact that you prefer not to keep any fish in the livewell.  I on the other hand do keep them in the livewell from time to time for photos.  If I ever fish out of your boat, I'll be sure to let them go boat side!  Now get out and catch some fish - but not smallies, they don't open for some time up in suds!  Cheers, UF"

322330,Fishnwire,2009-03-26 17:18:00,983,"  So the only way that you can ""share the experience"" is to hold more than one fish at the same time?  Talk about brilliance.     Let's try this again.   How often to you see pictures taken by professionals or appearing in high-quality fishing literature of dead or dying fish?  Not too often, because the pictures appear more appealing when the subject appears healthy.  Often after the picture of a healthy fish is taken it is the harvested...which is totally fine...but the picture of the dead fish in your sink will not look as nice as if you had taken it boatside.  It is not crazy to assume that if someone is holding two fish at the same time, they're not too concerned with releasing either...because if they were, they'd have done so before landing a second fish.  I never implyed rules or regs were being broken.  If you want to take a picture of yourself doing something that a decent percentage of anglers find somewhat distasteful, feel free.  You are entitled to harvest within the regs and I am entitled to think that holding up two trophy smallies for a picture is not a good look."
322332,lew,2009-03-26 17:20:00,12766,"    I find it interesting that you twice mentioned concern about stressing fish, yet as a fisherman your obviously not concerned about the stress your putting on a fish by jamming a bunch of hooks in his face and yanking him outta the water  I'm sure that's more stressful than sitting in a livewell or having a quick picture taken."
322339,anders,2009-03-26 17:25:00,1168," I see professionals lots at the end of a tournament during weight in...sometimes these guys are waiting in line for an hour or more with the boat on the trailer and fish swimming in there livewells, then yank out two of the biggest they kept in there livewells all day for a photo op...those are proffesionals, pictures usually taken by proffesionals...

You CAN fish and not stess fish in a livewell, you CAN'T fish without hooking the fish's mouth.  Sorry, your comparisson is not valid.

You're about a degree away from arguing that fishing is inhumane. Hey, we all have a bad day from time to time, but your thinking is along the line that we should all do something a certain predefined way. I prefer individual choice, and the stressing the fish arguement is totally bogus.  Somewhere down the line from your train of thought is the government dictating how we take pictures of legally caught fish. Does this mean I have to change my handle?"

It amazes me that some can actually draw a line in what is acceptable stress to a fish.  I fish and accept the fact that I am stressing out an animal for my pleasure. I use a livewell when fishing. I take double fish pictures. I release most of my fish but eat the odd one too.  Will I continue, Yes and I'll even let others do it on my boat too!

Anyway, doesn't anyone else feel that having a picture of yourself holding up two trophy sized smallmouths is a really bad look?  Unless your standing at the weigh-in table of a live-release tournament, the fact that you are holding two fish at the same time is evidence that you slaughtered not one, but two prime breeding adults...and why?  Do you really need to harvest that much fish in one day?  You're in all likelyhood not planning on having both specimens mounted, so why keep both?  A picture of an angler holding up a single fish on shore or in his boat doesn't scream out the fact that the guy is a fish-hog...holding up two does.  Smallmouth bass over 18 inches rarely make good table fare...and the law of averages tells us we'll almost certainly put a couple a decent eaters in the boat in the time it takes us to land two trophies...I just don't get it.  While I'm at it, pictures of guys holding up (obviously) dead fish in their driveways, kitchens or garages also leaves me decidedly unimpressed...but that's just me."

322273,Fishnwire,2009-03-26 15:58:00,983,"Where do I start?   By ""double-header"" you must mean you and your partner catching a fish at the same time, because there is no realistic, legal situation in which a single angler could land two trophy-sized smallies at the same time.  I've never felt the need to take a picture of me with a fish someone else caught...and I still wouldn't even if my partner caught his at the same time I caught mine.  Holding up a fish in a photo generally indicates something along the lines of, ""Hey check it out, I caught this!""  Why would you hold up someone else's fish for a photo?  I'm aware that livewells exist...just as I'm sure we're all aware that keeping fish in a livewell stresses them and (generally speaking) the longer fish are kept there, the more the survival rate goes down.  Keeping a healthy fish (which you don't plan on harvesting) in a livewell for any real length of time, just so you can get a picture with both hands full, is cruel and unnecessary."

One was in the LIVEWELL for a short while (much shorter than tournament fish) and when I got the bigger one we took a quick shot of them and let them both go - They're out there waiting for you right now!  As mentioned above, there's plenty of ways that people can take photos of two bass while releasing them both for another day...  THIS however, is not a good example of how to take multiple bass photos! lol    Fact of the matter is, although I don't condone keeping multiple trophy bass to take home, if people do it within the regulations there's not a darn thing anybody can do about it.

They like to keep their 2 or 3 best fish throughout the day in a livewell for pictures at the end of the day. Not only do they show that they can catch a hog of a fish, but they show that they can catch more than one. I think that anybody can fluke into a trophy fish from time to time, but can they catch mutiple trophy fish throughout a days fishing. Thats what takes skill. However, I do agree that the backyard, garage and kitchen sink pictures dont look very appealing. Just my 2 cents Mike"

Fishnwire - I can respect that you are taking a conservationistic (probably not a real word) stance on this one but to be honest you're targeting the wrong people. If the ministry changed the regs to prohibit multiple fish above a stated size than it would be a different story. For right now you may want to refer to page 9 of the regs.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/198219.pdf
322309,Fishnwire,2009-03-26 16:48:00,983,"OK...calm down folks...go back and read my posts...I never indicated people shouldn't keep fish within their legal limits, I'm just saying that TO ME, the look of multiple trophy fish being held by the same angler is a bit of a turn-off, and I just wondered if anyone felt the same.  As far as not fishing enough...my wife would have a different opinion.  I'm certainly secure enough in my fishing abilities that I don't feel the need to ""stage"" a picture to prove that I've caught more than one nice fish in the same day.  At my camp behind Sudbury I've often landed half a dozen smallies all over 18 inches before breakfast.  Big deal.  Hey feel free to keep whichever fish you are legally entitled to do so.  I'm just saying that some anglers, such as myself, find photographic evidence of killing (or unnecassarily stressing) multiple trophy-sized catches unappealing.  That's all I'm saying.  Gee, I guess I had better go join P3TA because of my crazy ""whack-job"" beliefs.  The fact that several posters felt the need to post pictures in an immature, failed attempt to antagonize anyone who feels the way I do speaks volumes about what kind of people take such photos."
