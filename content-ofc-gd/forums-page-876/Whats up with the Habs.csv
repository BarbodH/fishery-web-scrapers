Hopefully someday you will be able to put behind all that bothers you and see life in a much more positive way."
320564,Maverick,2009-03-23 03:46:00,371,Holdfast isn't far off. I'm a bit young for Pollocks days as gm but the habs play a weak style of hockey. We saw it last year in the playoffs and they are showing their true colours now. They have no size and no heart. The only reason they won a few games earlier in the season is their goaltending and now look where that is. They have a lot of work to do this offseason and some big decisions to make.
320573,carll2,2009-03-23 04:03:00,443,"get rid of gainey!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! then trade  koivu,kovalev , basically anyone overpayed that doesent do anything....then bring in roy as coach and some new players!!"

""Montreal Canadiens owner George Gillett is considering putting the team up for sale, La Presse reported on Monday.  Citing Canadiens president Pierre Boivin as its source, the Montreal newspaper reports that Gillett has hired BMO Capital Markets to examine the American businessman's options for selling his various assets, including the NHL team and its arena, the Bell Centre."""
320707,anders,2009-03-23 14:50:00,1168,"Goaltending...Goaltending...Goaltending!!!  This is Price's first full year in the league and they are expecting him to be a saviour!  When...in all seriousness...has he showed the skill, and poise to be a bona fide starter in the league???  Last year in the playoffs, he wasnt even that good.  He is still green and its not fair to him that he has been thrown in a hockey mad town like Montreal with all the pressure of there 100 yr anniversary to win the cup.  Halak as well....to young and inexpeirenced, yes they are gaining expeirence, but the Canadians should have an older tender there to help them along."
320710,Headhunter,2009-03-23 14:56:00,5703,"Simply, you can't teach heart! I watched the game Saturday night, Montreal had no heart and no desire to fight for what they wanted. Kovalev does not seem interested in going past, playing through the motions and as we have seen in the past, how Kovalev goes, so goes the Habs. No heart, no wins! HH"
320741,john_C,2009-03-23 15:48:00,12,By the looks of things as Montreal and Florida Tank...  The Leafs or Sens might (with a big of a miracle) sneak in to that final playoff spot...
320749,Cookslav,2009-03-23 16:16:00,1457," Amen brother...Amen  I used to feel this way about the leafs as well... Sure Sundin could score, but could he ralley his troops, or just appear to care for more then one or two games in a row? Just sub Koivu in for Sundin and I think you'll find the same equasion.  Yup IMO thats it in a nutshell. Not enough heart, not enough character, not enough strength. They got some fancy hands, and speed, but I tell you what...the Puck is not going in the net when the players are easily forced outside, or laying on the ice. The team is just plain deflated, demotivated, battered, bruised, and uneffective right now. Put them into a hard hitting playoff series and they will crumble."
320982,holdfast,2009-03-24 00:45:00,1813," Wrong, Wrong.  And Double Wrong O  They started the plunge when they got close to the Western Road Trip.  Im sure there were alot of legs and stomachs shaking when it was evident that they had to play the Big Bad Western Old Style Canadian Hit em grind em Hockey teams.  Sure enough they lost all thir games except one close one.  Im telling ya the teams thought they won the bingo game knowing the Canadians were coming to their rink.  The brothers you speak of and Hammer -Licks other guys tushes, needed some courage in the form of white snow."
321013,Angler16,2009-03-24 01:37:00,188,"Habs suck wont win a cup for a while, leafs beat them with a bunch of marlies!What a sad display, gotta love my leafs though they stuck it to the habs good. BLEED BLUE N WHITE 4EVER -Little Angler"
321118,carll2,2009-03-24 07:45:00,443,"if you ask me leafs,sens,habs are all in the same boat..no cup for neither of us this year!!!!"
322144,Northhunter,2009-03-26 04:42:00,214," People who say things like this about Koivu clearly just don't know...  The guy came over as a 5' 10"" kid from Finland. He had played no ""North American Style"" hockey at that point. His first training camp they had to tell him to stop hitting his teammates so hard. He skipped playing in the AHL and made the big club. By his 3rd (?) season he was wearing the C.  The year he missed the season because of cancer he came back to help them clinch a playoff spot. They came from behind (3-1) to beat a powerhouse Boston squad in 7 (the Bruins had Guerin and Thornton that year, and were favourites to possibly win the cup). Anyone who says Koivu lacks leadership or can't ""rally the troops"" needs to find a copy of this series and watch it. Seriously."
322146,Maverick,2009-03-26 04:52:00,371," I've seen the series and if I recall Theodore was amazing, Hart Trophy amazing. I do respect Koivu for what he did then, overcoming cancer and playing in the NHL is really an amazing feat. But like in all pro sports this question needs to be asked."
322155,Northhunter,2009-03-26 06:07:00,214, We'll see him down the stretch and in the playoffs. 3 pts in his last 2 and 9pts in 7 playoff games last year. Too bad Price kinda fell apart then too.
322369,Cookslav,2009-03-26 18:06:00,1457," Sure he's had moments...same as Sundun But he lacks the follow through, and consistency.  Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for him(mainly his determination) But he's not a leader, and neither was Sundin.  Both had the fancy hands, but both can sulk with the best of 'em, and can take a mean dive on occasion too.... Thats not a leadership qualtiy IMO. Great players to have on your roster for sure, but not with the big C ontheir chest. But hey we'll see....Thats the beauty of Sports!  We can see how it goes week to week!"
322377,walleyejigger,2009-03-26 18:13:00,876,there's something wrong with the habs ????????  last I checked they have won 1 in a row baby!!  YYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH    BBBBBOOOOOOOOOOYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  GO HABS GO

322550,Zebco,2009-03-27 00:15:00,123,"I'm a Leaf fan, but all Montreal has to do is win half the remaining games and there in unless Buffalo wins like 7 outta 9."
322556,holdfast,2009-03-27 00:26:00,1813," Actually I hope Montreal loses all their games and Stink Badly.  Just Maybe, just Maybe.  They can totally revamp their team and start over again as Im sick and tired of the same ole garbage Iv witnessed, well, since they traded Chelios for Savard. Saku became Captain, and they lost interest in obtaining Canadian players outside of Quebec."
322643,Northhunter,2009-03-27 03:18:00,214," Saks with the game winner tonight  He is definitely a leader. Just doesn't always show on the boxscore. Some people get the impression he is inconsistent... but 13 years in the league take their toll when you're playing as the top line centre at 5' 10"". He's had surgery on both knees. If he played all out 82 games he'd be damaged goods by the time it meant anything. In '06-'07 the team was on the bubble, missed the playoffs with a loss against Toronto in the last game of the year. He put up the best point totals of his career, despite playing a defensive style with a blind spot caused by a stick to the eye against the Canes in the previous playoffs (the team folded like a cheap tent once he got taken out).  Maybe we'll have to agree to disagree on the leadership, but if you took Sundin's size/build and Koivu's competitiveness you'd have one hell of a player."
322729,blaque,2009-03-27 12:57:00,2419," Miller is back in tonight for the first time in a long time. Im not getting excited though as Buffalo has been on a rollercoaster all year, faced with must win games the last few weeks and havent responded at all. Getting the 1st string goalie back might have been a good thing midseason when theres time left to get him back in game shape, but with 9 (?) games left, putitng him in and hoping hes gonna pick it right up and save the season, i dont think so, and with this team, theres no breath holding going on."
319384,holdfast,2009-03-20 00:28:00,1813,LOL  DIVE DIVE DIVE DIVE DIVE DIVE  DIVE  Any guesses to their choking?  I have a few but Id rather hear yours.
319385,F7Firecat,2009-03-20 00:31:00,347,HABS RULE!!!!!!!!  BEST TEAM EVER!!!!!! BAR NONE!!!!!!!   HABS RULE!!!!!!
319390,Maverick,2009-03-20 00:38:00,371,"They are too small up front and have no offence on the back end. Half the team are UFA which leads to too much ""I"" and not enough team. Their captain is awful. Goalies are both inconsistent."
319391,jediangler,2009-03-20 00:39:00,1923,"Too many former hab players in important positions. They are hired because of what they did, as players, not what they can do as GM or coach. And Carey Price sucks."
319401,joefish,2009-03-20 00:52:00,165,"Dont want to sound racist, but in my opinion....Too much Quebec influence.  Front office mostly French, coach is/was French, they want more players from Quebec. Not that its a bad thing but other teams have a multi cultural mix.  So why do the Habs think they have to have more French players?"
319409,Maverick,2009-03-20 01:09:00,371," Are you serious??? Have a look at their roster, more Europeans and Americans than anything. Koivu, Kovalev, Hamerlik, Lang, Kosteatsyn bros...  I don't know if they think they need more french players but they need a little size up front and if their name is Jean Guy who cares as long as they can hit and have a bit of skill."
319415,ColdH20guy,2009-03-20 01:17:00,312,"First off, who cares what is happening to the Habs,I would rather watch grass grow or paint dry and wouldnt go to a Habs game even if it was free in a box; cant stand them personally...now if you are talking the Anaheim Ducks or even the Leafs, thats different.....!"
319416,uglyfish,2009-03-20 01:18:00,981,"simple reason as to why theyre choking... the goalie that carried them got hurt, and has no confidence left, which leads to inconsistency. they lost a couple guys to injury. but most importantly, they dont play as a team. they have a ton of skill, but no desire to play together to win games. they need to check the egos at the door, and play as a team"
319417,joefish,2009-03-20 01:19:00,165,Got to agree with you coldh20guy!!!
319419,Grimace,2009-03-20 01:24:00,2020,"I saw a funny in the Sun last year that showed a Leaf fan handing a Senators fan his psychiatrist's business card.  I thought it was pretty funny.   Looks like he could be busy with all of East Central Canada's hockey fans with the odd flight to Edmonton.  lol.  I hope they turn it around.   As a Leafs fan I am suppose to hate them but everytime I go to a habs Leafs game in Montreal I have a great time in a great building with great fans.  Teasing back and forth and all in good fun.  Every time I have left a Leafs-Habs game in Montreal I end up shaking the peoples hands in the seats around me and they always wish me a safe drive home.  It is a great place to see a hockey game.   They (like us) deserve a winner.   Although it is genetically embedded in me to hate them.    LOL.  I can't believe I just said that.   I am going to go wash my mouth out with soap.  I am still craving for a Leafs-Habs play-off series.   Would have been for the stanley cup if it wasn't for that lousy Kerry Fraser.   We would of thumped them that year as well, could have been epic."
319442,holdfast,2009-03-20 02:03:00,1813,"  I think a Stanley Cup means nothing to most of the players.  The priority is to cross the pond as soon as possible and be with their families.  Yup no size up front, A captain that is there only as a figure head.  Nobody to fire then up.  Cowering to the more aggressive teams.  A Goalie that's totally lost confidence in himself and defenseman that let the opposition have their way in the crease.  Nobody that can hit except Komerserik.  Nobody that knows how to hit.  They'd rather yap, than physically come to the aid of a team mate.  In one case, one player would rather go to the league and cry harassment then being a man and fending for himself.  All in All, a bunch of Wussies, that should go back and learn to play hockey in the Western and American leagues.  Last but not least, terrible drafts and trades. To much politics on the team now.  Unfortunately they do not have the first and soul picks of Quebec players anymore."
319443,walleyejigger,2009-03-20 02:10:00,876,"embarassing......just embarassing......what can i say, there's no excuse, they have the talent, but no execution, they've given up  GO HABS GO"
319450,bushart,2009-03-20 02:20:00,2628,"K' here's all you need to know....  Carbonneau was fired because he tried to take that pride of the team that ran through that locker room for a hundred years with mostly boys from rural Quebec, that this was life...and instill it into paycheck players from overseas..can't do it.  the ghost of the Rocket and presence of Jean Beliveau run through the veins of most Habs fans...but I think these boys must have heard the fish were bitin back in Russia and bait goes on sale the end of March.  And I'm a Sens Fan. (still a Canadian though)  Bushart"
319462,ehg,2009-03-20 02:38:00,2666,"The Canadiens were doing well until the Kostisyn brothers and Kovalev were linked with bikers or mob people or something, that is when it started taking a turn for the worse."

319497,gone_fishin,2009-03-20 05:20:00,481, totally agree!!! the leafs were definitely the better team that year... i was only 8 or 9 years old at the time... but that would have been the most epic stanley cup final in history! and the leafs would have won it too... unbelievable!!!
319533,JohnF,2009-03-20 13:00:00,3494,"The Canadian east has gotta be the toughest place to live up to fan expectations. Combine hockey history & Canuck pride in the game and you've got extreme pressure. Factor in the Quebecois heritage thang and you've got near impossibility. Nothing less than a Cup will satisfy the fans in our eastern markets. Pity the Habs who gotta do it while including a lot of french sounding names on the roster. Nothing short of a Cup will make all things right with the world in Toronto, Montreal or even Ottawa (just cuz they live too close).  JF"

319626,blaque,2009-03-20 17:30:00,2419,"WOW  This is whats up.........i was at the game, and even the habs fans in the seat next to me put their hands to their mouths and went ""oh ho ho ho hoooooo"" TV broadcast didnt do this hit justice. It crashed thru the ears of every fan, AND every player on the montreal bench apparently. Because it seemed to have put their tails between their legs for the remainder of the night.  I couldnt believe gaustad or any other sabre skated the rest of the night unmolested. And i mean flabbergasted. Their was NO response to this hit. Kovalev got up, looked at the ref like........hey, what was that all about. Thats the NHL Alexi. He may as well have went to the dressing room for the night. He and the rest of the team were done based on this one hit??? Sabres went on to a 5-1 win, untouched, with ZERO response to this bone crusher to their star player. I was amazed..........the habs group next to us, didnt seem to be so amazed lol. That says alot.  As a sidenote, i agree for the most part that its fun when the habs come to town (buffalo). As someone said earlier, at the end of the game, i too actually shook hands with the habs group next to us, we talked during the game, and i even gave him a high five when they got their one goal........i told them they deserve at least one reason to cheer for the drive (they were from toronto so they werent really true habs representation) I also watched a pair of habs jerseys walking out of their seats trying to pick a fight with every guy in a seat........literally, throwing  beer as they left.  Good times!"

319637,JohnAB,2009-03-20 18:05:00,178,"First off, they should have fired the GM and the coach. Gainey has made too many goofs and let too many players walk and get nothing in return. Team has lost all its heart and needs someone to grab them by the scruffs of their necks and get them going again. A Mark Messier type guy. As for the goaltending, the team gives up way too many shots and noone gets physical in front of the net and Price lost his confidence. Price will be fine but when he got back from his injury, they should have sent him down to Hamilton for a conditioning stint instead of throwing him to the wolves.  Still cheer for them though and always will. At least with the Habs there is a flicker of a future where as the Leafs, their flicker was gone in about 1968! LOL  And in 93, the Habs would have swept the Leafs in 4. Roy would have outshone Potvin by a wide margin. And the non-call on Gretzky in 93 was sweet justice for the Kings and couldn't have happened to a better guy than Gilmour as he the year before broke Sandstrom's arm with a cowardly slash from behind as Sandstrom was skating up the ice. Gilmour was not penalized nor suspended for his slash."
319911,Northhunter,2009-03-21 07:54:00,214,"It's Price. The guy got hurt back around christmas, came back and tweaked something in practice - didn't tell the trainers and played that nights game anyway and played amazing. Then he went back on IR and hasn't been the same since.  They are playing him too much because of the pressure in Montreal - all the hype about him and the centennial year, etc, etc. To go into the playoffs with him not up to snuff could seriously hurt the kids career. They are trying to get him back into form by playing him through it but it's costing games. Back-to-back games and he'll lose the first one, and play the 2nd as well. That's not how you get out of a slump.  Halak has played amazing when he gets a game, they usually come out with a win... but he rarely gets the start. The same thing happened a couple years ago when they missed the playoffs. Halak was the rookie backup, Huet was the starter but got hurt. Halak's play down the stretch saved the season until the last game of the year. Huet came back cold and got the start for that one game because of who he was, not how he played... and lost. A win would have given them the 8th seed.  Gainey is an awesome GM. He basically made the Dallas Stars what they are today... got them the cup in '99 and lost in the finals in 2000. But firing Carbo was a not-so-good move."
