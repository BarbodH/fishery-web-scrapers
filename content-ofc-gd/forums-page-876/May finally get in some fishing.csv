My original intent was to fish for perch off of Point Abino in the Eastern Basin of Lake Erie, but I'm told the ice may not be out.  As an alternative I may have to stick to shore fishing Queenston or Port Dalhousie.  Any suggestions? I'm sure regardless of where I end up, I'll just be happy to wet a line again."

322721,huey graphite,2009-03-27 12:45:00,362,"UF.......I've always wanted to try long point bay. I've heard the fidhing is incredible there. This just might be the right time.  Irishfield....I fish the Grand near the mouth most summers. Typically targetting perch and walleye, but catching catfish and sheepshead most often. Perhaps if I target catfish and sheepshead, I just might boat some decent walleye  Thanks"
