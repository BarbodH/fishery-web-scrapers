I have to say though, that the Pacific Coast Highway in southern California has to be one of the most beautiful places on earth. Although I haven't been a global traveler beauty is everywhere if you just take a moment to look and that's what I did.  This shot of my wife and daughter was taken on a small beach that you had to navigate down an ancient flight of stone steps to get to....    What a view!    Maybe this is why I wouldn't think twice about moving there    Seems like everyone from the ages of 15 to the time they can afford a surf board were skimming the incoming waves from the beaches    These guys were everywhere    These guys were everywhere too....also spotted many many killer whales but I couldn't snap a shot of them because I could never predict where and when they'd surface!    And as you can see...my little girl didn't know what to do with herself...being that it was her first time in the sand!    Enjoy...stay tuned!"
