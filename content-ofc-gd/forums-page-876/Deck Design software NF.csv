321644,Jer,2009-03-25 12:11:00,1426,"I'm building a new deck shortly.  I was wondering if there is any software available for easy drawings, maybe spit out a basic list of materials?"
321651,Gerritt,2009-03-25 12:30:00,6129,"Jer,  it is called a take-off... and you can have a deck designed for free from Home Depot, including drawings and materials list.  G"
321657,pikehunter,2009-03-25 12:40:00,1659,"As Gerritt said. Take your measurements and ideas to the deck design desk at H.D or any other lumberyard and they'll set you up.  Go midmorning weekdays, the weekends are not a good time to do it."
321665,blaque,2009-03-25 13:00:00,2419,"If youve gotta be a do it yourselfer from the 1st step to the last step though, there seem to be many of these Do it yourself deck design programs thru a google search."
321686,Dnthmn,2009-03-25 13:40:00,128,"Double check your municipalities building codes as well, it may make a huge difference in what you need versus what you are told by the programs they use at Home Depot and such. That is if you are planning on getting a permit."
321692,Cast-Away,2009-03-25 13:57:00,790,"I've used a free tool from here:  Cedar Deck Design  You have to register first, but it does work and gives you a materials list as well."
321797,Tomcat,2009-03-25 18:58:00,395,The only restriction with a design from HD is that the design will not include any lumber size they don't carry.
321841,Sinker,2009-03-25 20:36:00,8692,"I wouldn't reccomend the plans from HD. They will give you a basic idea, but usually, they are waaaaaaay overkill. Try Home Hardware. They have better plans, and they're also free.  Sinker"
322178,Jer,2009-03-26 12:32:00,1426,"  Thanks for the link.  That at least allowed me to see what the deck would look like and try different configurations, options."
