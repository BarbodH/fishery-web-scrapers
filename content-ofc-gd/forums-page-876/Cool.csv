322754,kemper,2009-03-27 14:01:00,2232,Wait a second...the camera looks like its in some kind of a tank thing now...I see a bottom?
322767,maybe,2009-03-27 14:54:00,307,"Yep, it's in the university's sturgeon tank for the winter - see the fish cam location page (which gives months for each species) and the non-video fish cam page (which lists the sturgeons' sizes).  Tank or not, it's a neat cam.  Thanks for posting it."
322789,Bob,2009-03-27 15:43:00,370,"Yep, I've been watching that fish cam for years.  Won't be long and they'll have it in the river beside the power station and you can drool over all the big steel.  After that, through the summer, the numbers of Atlantics are amazing.  Then the chinooks and other salmon show up.  I happened to be watching one time when they pulled the camera to clean the lens. Found myself looking at clouds and a cleaning rag for a couple minutes."

The only problem ive noticed wiht the camera is the local Soo michigan residents love to come out and snag atlantics all day as soon as the fish show up on cam....Ive seen a ton of snaggers hook up but not many landed....Its sometimes hard to watch and not say anything especially when they start yelling at everyone in the boats for trolling to close to the ""snagging area"".....  An awesome piece of equipment tho....I watch it all year too!   TDunn"
