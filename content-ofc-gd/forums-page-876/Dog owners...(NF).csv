The bags are not that cheap but the quality if great... I pay $65 for the big bag. I switched her because she had a couple of mild bouts of colitis and I thought the food was the reason... look for beet pulp as an ingredient in the food, if it has it, stay clear. Beet pulp is put into dog food to absorb water in the stomach and make their crap more solid....kind of makes up for poor quality ingredients... this was told to me by the owner of Beowulf kennels who raises world class Old English Mastiffs... she also started making her own food because of all the crap out there. She also said that Eukaneuba started going down the toilet when Effem foods bought them up... same company that makes Twix, Skittles, Mars and snickers to name a few... want a chocolate?"

Every time we take the lab to the vet she says whatever your feeding your dog keep it up cause his coat is beautiful....Theres another product I also have discovered you may want to know about although it has nothing to do with Kirkland....Its a product called ""Hip Action"" . Its made by a company called Zukes and what it is is a treat that has gluecosamine and chondrotin  in it and it helps dogs with hip and other joint problems. Ive been giving it to my 13 year old dashund and now he's back to playing around with his toys again like he used to..... So all in all, I highly recoment the Kirkland dog food and also the Zukes Hip Action to anyone with an older dog that is having joint problems.......  Cheers !!"

Last month I bought a bag of Iams (which is probably even worse) because the Eukanuba had jumped considerably in price and on the spot I didn't know what else to buy.

321664,Bly,2009-03-25 12:58:00,1556,"Hey Rick  I haven't any experience with the Kirkland food but you also mentioned Innova.  Innova (just one of Natura's brands) is my food of choice for Harley.   I did a lot of research on dog foods many years ago and although it might be best to make my own, the Innova was an excellent alternative.  Innova may look expensive when you compare it to another bag the same size but usually the serving portions are very different.  Example......  Harley is  18lbs, he gets almost 2/3 cup PER DAY.  If I were feeding him say Purina Adult Fit and Trim, the suggested serving is 1-1/4 to 1-3/4 cups per day, big difference for a little dog.  A $37 bag lasts almost approx 2.5 months for me.  I haven't the information for the larger breeds handy but you can refer to Natura's website for an idea of the servings etc.  One of the reasons for the portion difference..Innova does not use any fillers.  Harley is a small pek, shih tzu mix, 2 breeds that are prone to allergies and ear infections and a few more things, almost 5 and trouble free and his breeding was certainly not ideal.  A little side thing...the food sources used in Innova are human grade.  They do not use seconds, thirds etc., as was/is the popular way to produce dog food and cut cost.  Many of the big popular ""better"" brands (Science Diet, Euk ) were included in the list of foods that had to be recalled a few years ago, Natura brands were not.  Even if the info I have is a lot of hype, the fact that they did not make the list while so many others did, makes me feel better"

I was very impressed with the company, All Canadian sourced ingredients, designed to meet Europe Union dictates for pet foods.  FYI, dogs are carnivores, and do not need grains such as corn, etc.  Whatever you decide follow the feeding instructions on the bag, and observe the shape of your dog.  You should be able to feel her ribs, but not see them.  She should have a tight waist, and her muscles should be defined.  There are only 3 or 4 companies that manufacture their own foods, all others contract the making of their food to outside sources, and this was the cause of the recent dog deaths and pet food recalls (tainted grains from where else...China)  Just my .02$ worth  John"

321681,ch312,2009-03-25 13:29:00,1590,a good tip for quickly finding quality food is to look at how much you are suppose to feed your dog with each food. cheap foods full of fillers require the dog to eat much more food to get the same amount of nutrients.  a perfect example would be my 2 dogs. the lab is allergic to most foods so she gets the high quality food and the beagle/hound gets cheaper stuff. the 80lb lab eats the EXACT SAME amount of food each day as the 20-25lb mutt! this is following the feeding recommendations on each bag of food. just goes to show you how much filler is in cheaper foods...  im in the process of switching the mutt over to good food now.

Their stomachs become accustomed to what they have been eating every day on a regular basis, and going directly from one brand of dog food to another can be very harmful in some situations.

322212,JFR,2009-03-26 13:35:00,498,"I was surfing a dog/cat site and came upon this:  Interesting to say the least  John   10 Secrets Pet Food Companies Don't Want You to Know 1. Pet food is NEVER mostly meat.  Many ads suggest that it is... In order to list a meat source first on the bag label pet food companies resort to a variety of gimmicks. Here are a few to get you thinking.  1st Listing, a ""wet"" ingredient in what ends up being an essentially dry finished product. Wet meat gets a lot lighter when the moisture is cooked out. This labeling loophole is blatantly deceptive to the general public. All ingredients should be weighed and listed in dry weight equivalents for you to know truly how much of each makes up the ration. If the label lists, ""chicken"" it means chicken weighed when wet. Drop 75% of the value. If, on the other hand, it says, ""chicken meal"" they play fairly. If it says, ""meat (any type) by-product meal"" or ""meat (any type) by-products"" it was never meat to begin with. Find another food.  Another gimmick is to ""split carbohydrates"" (grains) into multiple parts to get the ""meat"" to list first. Label ingredients are listed in descending order by weight. So, If you have 10 lbs. of chicken meal and 25 lbs. of rice, which should appear first on the label? Chicken of course! (if you want people to buy the stuff). Here's how it's done...  1st- CHICKEN MEAL, 2nd- GROUND RICE, 3rd- RICE BRAN, 4th- RICE GLUTEN.  Pretty sneaky and obviously deceptive unless you know the trick. Rice Flour, Brewer's Rice and Rice ala Ronny could also have been listed if they really wanted to be fancy. A related tactic is to use a variety of grains with different names to get meat listed first. This is slightly more valid since they have different amino acid profiles and are truly different ingredients. Grains cost a lot less than meat. Meat ""by-products"" cost a lot less than meat. Both also have considerably less food value. The last gimmick for now is the campaign to convince the public that meat by-products and meat are just about the same thing. Hmm... ""Honey, I'm having a ribeye steak tonight and you're having a nice pile of by-products, ok?"" ""Would you like the chicken breast or the intestine-cartilage-beak medley with your rice, Bob?"" ""Well gee Dear, doesn't really make any difference to me, they all sound equally delicious, nutritious and healthy!""  By definition, by-products may contain anything from the specified animal except, (in the case of chicken), feathers and feces and, (in the case of beef), hoof, hide and feces. Meat and fat are separated out first because they are costlier and are therefore not present in any appreciable quantity. What's left is the bones, tendons, cartilage, beaks, feet and innards. Proudly displayed and masqueraded as meat. A pet food bag is not a place for dumping stuff of unknown nutritional value. Some foods even use the term , ""SELECT by-products"". All these contortions serve one purpose; To make you think that you're getting more meat than you really are in your bag of pet food. After all, who'd pay $35 for a bushel of corn?! Well, keep reading!  2. The cooking process used in pet foods KILLS off a vital component: enzymes.  In order to eliminate bacteria and make cutesy shapes that pets care nothing about, processing temperatures in excess of 160 degress F are used to extrude or bake your pet's food.  So what? Well, glad you asked. This places the entire burden for digestion on your pet's pancreas to supply the enzymes necessary for breaking down nutrients for absorption. In nature, this is far from the case. Animals naturally follow the path of ""least digestive resistance"" in the wild. Consider the fox who catches a rabbit. First item on the menu is the contents of the gut. Let the rabbit do the digesting and enjoy! The rabbit spent hours nibbling grasses and grains readying them for the fox's easy absorption of carbohydrates. Quick and cheap fuel. Next the fox buries or hides the rest to stew a spell. What we call, ""turning rancid"" the fox calls, ""just getting better"". In a couple days, the live enzymes in the rabbit meat have broken it down into easily digested protein. Notice how no fire was used in this process? For dessert, a little bone gnawing for the marrow, the calcium, and the teeth cleaning, and it's naptime. Left for the lower animals in the hierarchy are most of the by-products and the hide.  Let's get back to your pet. In puppies and kittens, the pancreas is usually robust and up to the task of supplying sufficient digestive enzymes to make dead food somewhat useable and fulfill it's other vital functions. With age, however, pancreatic function is weakened and often can't keep up with this undue burden. If the pet food fed day in and day out is of low nutritional value to begin with, the taxing effect on the system will be all the greater and the pancreas will most likely give up that much sooner. The consequences to your pet's health are too broad in scope to cover here.  3. Giving ""real food"" aka ""table scraps"" is the RIGHT thing to do!  Stepping on a lot of toes here to smash the myth that you should only feed the stuff from the bag and nothing else ever, PERIOD. What is it they are afraid of anyway? That your pet will learn to beg? Unlearn that. That your pet won't eat the chaff they call ""food"" after tasting the real deal? Probably. Or that it will throw the delicate balance of their finely tuned ""nutrition"" out of whack somehow? He He Hoo, hardly.  Here's the scoop... Providing real food (not potato chips or other junk food) in its raw form counteracts some of the deficit that can be caused by only feeding commercially prepared pet food. It can provide the living enzymes to make digestion an easy rather than burdensome process. But, don't just go wild and throw everything in the feeding trough. Good bets for pets are raw carrots, broccoli, yogurt, cheese, garlic and meats. Cooked oatmeal, rice, corn, squash and the like are fine too. Don't feed raw grains, legumes, potatoes, onions, celery or chocolate which are either unusable or unhealthy. If you aren't comfortable with raw meat and fish, don't do it. Keep in mind, they aren't people and have an entirely different gastro-intestinal system than we do. Introduce new foods a little at a time about three times a week to start and give your pet's pancreas a much needed break.  4. Most ""vet recommended"" foods pay mightily for the ""honor"".  Does it matter that the majority of vets know very little about pet nutrition? The public is told to, ""Ask your vet"". The vet is told by the pet food companies, ""we'll send you to Hawaii for a week of golf if you sell and endorse XYZ brand pet food"". In school, vets-to-be could ELECT to take an overview course in animal nutrition. Or not. There have been changes of late to make this required study. AS IT WELL SHOULD BE!  You are miles ahead if you understand the pet food label yourself and take the time to learn some basic nutritional concepts. It's not that complicated! Find out for yourself, trust your own judgement and ignore what people say who are getting paid to say it.  5. The #1 vet recommended brand is probably the #1 worst pet food value.  Without mentioning any names, if it lists corn as the first ingredient on the label and gets blasted by the competition for it, you know the company. Read the label! Compare it to the cheapest stuff you can find. There isn't a dimes worth of difference in most cases.  How much does it cost them to make a 40 lb. bag of this stuff you may wonder? Right? Sit down. How about less than $3 including the cost of the bag? How much does the duped public shell out for the bushel of corn and peanut shells most recommended by vets? About $35. ""Have a nice flight to Maui, Dr. Cutter and thanks again for your support"".  6. Feeding ""Soft-Moist"" diets will cut your pet's life expectancy in half.  Thankfully, these foods are on the steep decline but aren't gone yet. Perhaps killing your customers isn't a good way to develop long term brand loyalty. These toxic morsels are so loaded with chemicals to stay soft and prevent molding and so laden with sugar to cover the harsh chemical taste, they rip a pet's insides out. The sweetness is addictive and you'll hear owners say, ""Fifi just won't eat anything else"". Well, then better buy the small bag because who knows how long Fifi will be eating at all? Anybody feeding this garbage should stop at once and the manufacturers of it should be faced with a class action.  7. Many companies have ""slithered"" away from using ETHOXYQUIN.  The once popular, and staunchly defended as safe, preservative (antioxidant) called ""Ethoxyquin"" has been mostly abandoned because of ""hushed"" litigation and settlements with professional breeders. It formerly was championed by pet food manufacturers (and others) as an advanced and healthy inclusion in pet food in an attempt to hide the fact that it was never intended to be eaten, much less on a daily basis. It was originally formulated as a rubber stabilizer and a color retention agent. Tires stayed pliable and spices stayed red. Despite efforts to get it approved as a food stabilizing agent in people food, it is only allowed for extremely limited application with colored spices. The people who know the devastating truth about this ingredient when eaten daily by pets have been paid off and forced to never tell their stories. There are innumerable instances of stillbirth, sudden liver failure, kidney dysfunction, permanent pigment changes, tumors and death thought to be caused by the addition of this wonder substance to pet food starting in about 1987. Much of the talk about ethoxyquin has quieted since the major pet food companies jumped off the bandwagon and switched to safer (and less legally troublesome) preservatives like forms of vitamins C. If they want the trust of the public, they should own up to their mistakes and come clean. Fat chance. All you'll get is denial.  8. Nature didn't intend for pets to eat dry food devoid of enzymes.  Convenience is paid for in reduced pet health. Where is it written that your pet's bowl has to be filled with chalk dry nuggets of quasi-nutritious ground up brown stuff? We've been sold on a bad idea. We bought it because it made life easier. Until the real bill comes, that is. But doesn't kibbled food make their teeth shiny and their breath fresh? Won't their teeth fall out if they eat soft stuff? Yeah, right. Ever watch your dog eat? Does it look like some kind of teeth cleaning exercise? How about the cat? Really getting the old gum line clean huh? The truth about teeth cleaning is this... sticks, rocks, yarn, bones, toys and saliva primarily accomplish this task, not food. Commercial pet food has to be flavor enhanced with digest and sprayed-on fat to be even remotely attractive to your pet. Without these palatability modifications, the old dry kibble would just sit there and get dusty. People get paid big money to invent coatings to make your pet dive headfirst into the food bowl. Because then you smile and feel like it must be healthy and that Fifi loves the food and you too so you'll buy it again. Right? Remember, the fox didn't go in search of a crunchy rabbit. It ate the soft one and it has a dazzling smile and a fully charged pancreas.  9. Some companies sneak sugar into pet food to hook your pet.  Watch out for these guys! They call it other things of course... (cane molasses, corn syrup) but it absolutely does not belong in your pet's food bowl. Processed sugars are foreign to dogs and cats and over the long term can result in obesity, tooth decay and diabetes (along with other maladies). Until 2 years ago, propylene glycol was being used as a sweet tasting preservative by those who must have cared much more about shelf life than about pet health. Thankfully, it has finally been banned. Pet food companies will tell you that the industry is tightly regulated and that your pet's health is being fastidiously protected. Do you buy that one? The FDA can't even keep up with human food and didn't lift a finger on behalf of the pet owners during the ethoxyquin debate.  The regulating body for pet food ingredients is AAFCO. The American Association of Feed Control Officials. The rules and definitions they adopt are made by those with vested interests and are enforced through ""voluntary compliance"". The fox guards the rabbit hutch here.  10. Almost all manufacturers use stool hardening agents in pet food.  Convenience again triumphs over pet health. Stool modifiers make clean up easier and mask the effects of nutrient malabsorption. Who's going to buy a pet food if you've got to SCRAPE up after your dog? It's easier to just stack those little bricks into a pile or kick them elsewhere. Consider however the strain on your pet's innards. Would you put concrete mix in your pancake batter? How about sawdust? If you were dieting, would you mix ground peanut shells into your breakfast cereal? Well, they do all that and more for your beloved pet. See if any of these made it into your pet food bag: sodium bentonite, powdered cellulose, beet pulp, tomato (or any other) pomace, ground peanut shells? The explanation for including these usually is that they are fiber sources for your pet's well being. Maybe a little truth there but not the real reason they are added. Whole grains provide great fiber content. A bit of bran would do well too. The real goal is to make you buy the food again because clean up time is so easy and enjoyable with brand XYZ's designer stools. Before you do this to your pet, try it yourself for a few days. One question to ask a company representative is this, ""Aren't there times when my pet needs to evacuate it's system rapidly such as when a toxin is ingested or when the kitty or doggy flu comes around? Is having a cork in there at all times really a good idea? You'll then likely hear mumbling about ""Our research..."" and ""regulating intestinal transit time for optimal nutrient absorption"". Do you buy that one? If the food is good and fed properly, stools will be fine without forcing your pet to work a brick through their digestive and excretory systems."

321534,2 tone z71,2009-03-25 01:33:00,1311,"I fed my last Rottie anything and blamed myself when she got sick and well passed shortly after,not something I like talking about,I spoiled her and gave her all kinds of crap she shouldent of had incl the Wall Mart/Costco Pedigree crap food ,my New Rottie gets the best the vet has ,like ya say Rick its 80-90.00 @ bag,bag lasts a few months thou ,I only want the best I can give my pup will never give her that generic no nutritan crap ever again,my new Rottie is now 20 months and just Muscle and very fit and energenetic,I would stay with what ya know my 5 cents"
321541,bigfish1965,2009-03-25 01:41:00,3382,"Thats the thing..when I looked at the Kirkland  stuff, it scored higher than Eukanuba for nutrition... I think the site was dogfoodchat.com or something like that which had the most concise reviews of dog foods. There's always Innova and  timberwolf but that stuff is pushing $100 a bag. Jack will be on meds for life that cost me $100 a month already (Medicam)."
321544,Maverick,2009-03-25 01:46:00,371,"Just look at the ingredients. They list the ingredients in order or quantity, so there is more of the first ingredient then the second etc. You want to try to stay away from corn or any other corn variations especially as a top ten ingredient. Just think of how our stomachs digest corn, not very good, same as a dog.  I feed my pup Nutro Natural Choice Chicken meal, rice and oatmeal formula. It's about 30-40 bucks for 8kgs up here in North Bay at Pet Valu so it's pricey but my pup likes it. I'm sure you could find it cheaper in the city though. I found that when he was eating the Dog Chow from purina (corn was the top ingredient on this food) he would have the sh!ts really bad and take forever to crap but with this food he is relatively normal."
321551,bigfish1965,2009-03-25 01:50:00,3382,"Yeah I checked that and there is no corn in this stuff. Chicken, chicken meal, whole grain brown rice, barley are the top four ingredients. I'll give it a try and if I have issues I will switch back."
321552,JohnF,2009-03-25 01:54:00,3494,Could you teach him to eat fresh fish?  JF
321553,bigfish1965,2009-03-25 01:55:00,3382,He'd starve if he was depending on me with my luck lately
321554,JohnF,2009-03-25 01:57:00,3494, Mebbe he'd like skunk?  JF
321555,Daplumma,2009-03-25 01:57:00,1961,"Alot depends on the animal to be sure.My buds Rhodesion gets the runs if he looks at any food other than Vet med stuff.Both of my dogs and my brothers dogs follow the chickens around like they were doggy vending machines,scooping up c-poop like it was kibbles.I did the IAMS stuff and a few others but I use the TSC high protien stuff for now...untill I actually read get off my lazy butt and read up on this.I will say that Rick will not steer you wrong about dogs.He loves his dogs more than he hates conservatives.I will say I love my dogs more than I hate most liberals...cept for my wife. Joe There a a few libs I can share a beer or two with..and maybe fish with.."
321556,Maverick,2009-03-25 01:58:00,371,"yeah, my vet told me to try and stay away from the corn because my pup has a sensitive stomach and he seems happier with the new food too so it's a win win. Might be 20 bucks more than the cheap stuff but it's worth it in the end. I guess you get what you pay for. Kind of like human food, I'd love to eat t-bones and prime rib everyday but can't afford it, but in the same way you can't eat TV dinners everyday and expect to be healthy."
321557,pigeonfisher,2009-03-25 02:00:00,696,"Have you thought about incorporating the ""Fresh Frozen"" wet food with the lower cost Costco food.  We had one in Orangeville called Dogs We Love."
321561,Burtess,2009-03-25 02:07:00,901,"Don't know if you have seen this site:  http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/, lots of good info there....  Most of the big advertised foods are total junk (star ratings from the link above):  Science Diet (1 star), Eukanuba (1 star), Iams (1 star), Pedigree (1 star), etc....  I did a lot of research on what to feed my boxer and ones that I have used include Canidae (5 star), Wellness (5 star), and Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul (4 star). I have been feeding Kirkland Chicken and Rice, or Lamb and Rice for a couple years now and am really happy with the balance of the ingredient list and cost point.  It is rated a 3 star food.  It is produced by Diamond Pet foods (http://www.diamondpet.com/), the same manufacturer of Chicken Soup.  The ingredients are very similar to Chicken Soup as well, but it is a lot cheaper. The price has gone up drastically in the last couple months, it used to be around $23 for a 40lb bag, but it is still a great deal.  Burt"
321562,bigfish1965,2009-03-25 02:09:00,3382," Not heard of that...what is it, PF?"
321563,pigeonfisher,2009-03-25 02:14:00,696,"Rick,  They make dog meatloaf.  You buy it by the tray and mix it in with your dry food or serve it separate depending on your dogs size and eating habits.  Incorporating the dry food helps with teeth.  Dogs We Love...It's worth the drive."
321564,Marko,2009-03-25 02:14:00,854,"My gf`s parents buy their dog food at Costco, They have 5 retrievers, and they all are healthy. They have a vet come by their place every few months and check on them, never had any problems."
321566,bigfish1965,2009-03-25 02:16:00,3382,Thanks for the info. I just read my ingredients on my Eukanuba....rather dissapointed. But I am encouraged by your success. One of the sites i came across in my studies was a boxer club site and the members were rather enthusiastic about the exact version you mention. That will likely be my choice. I MAY top off some extra glucosamine since there is a bit less in the Kirkland.
321567,bigfish1965,2009-03-25 02:19:00,3382," Thanks, Steve! Reading their site now."
321573,Bob,2009-03-25 02:38:00,370,"We've tried all kinds of expensive stuff for our husky just because we love him and want the best for him.  This obstinate character turns up his nose at them all.  The only dry food he'll touch is the generic stuff from No Frills.  He won't eat canned dog food either but let him see a piece of meat I cook for us (especially liver) and he goes berserk.  I buy good cuts for us so he gets some of it.  He's 10 years old, healthy and frisky as a puppy and not the least bit overweight.  I guess I'll continue to give him what he wants."
321575,bigugli,2009-03-25 02:59:00,6138,"My little dogs get the no name stuff.  The vet says its not bad, and better than some big names.  No big dint in the wallet. Safe veggies are added to the kibble (no onions and garlic) occasionaly.  They also get fish twice a week."

Nutram is owed by Maple Lodge Farms and they use human grade chicken and lamb in their products. I spend roughly 60.00 a month on food and I ma feeding a 93lbs Malamute.
