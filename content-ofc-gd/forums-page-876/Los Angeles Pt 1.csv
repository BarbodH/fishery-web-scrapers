On Friday, we took off from Buffalo Int'l Airport. It's a dump, it matches the rest of the town lol. Anyway, once the sun came up this is what I saw....      So, after touching down in Los Angeles, we drove and hour to a suburb call San Gabriel which is on the outskirts in Los Angeles County. My wife's cousin decided to take us on a tour of Hollywood. What I noticed though was the smog. It was everywhere...and everything had a haze...    The next day, my wifes extremely generous cousins drove us to Las Vegas! It was a sight to see!       So after an 8 hour round trip (with my 2 year old in the back seat) we were in Ventura County visiting more relatives....so again, I had to escape, and the coast was phenomenal.        Found this guy hiding    And how could I leave out the fishing pic?     Thanks for reading, I have many many more photos to go through, if you really want to see many more then check out my flickr collection.   Dave"
322114,ohhenrygsr,2009-03-26 03:34:00,947,Wow Dave beautiful pictures what camera where you using?
322123,Joey,2009-03-26 03:50:00,9122,"Outstanding pictures, thanks for sharing those.  Joey"
322158,limeyangler,2009-03-26 10:10:00,5204,"Stunning pictures....thanks for sharing, love the one of the surfer....but then agan i like them all."
322171,tinbanger,2009-03-26 12:05:00,1028,"Great Photos , love the surfer pic as well   TB"
322190,blaque,2009-03-26 12:53:00,2419,"Actually......Buffalo isnt a ""town"", it is actually a city, yup.........we got electricity, malls ....and even airplanes that land and take off from here and just......all kinds of stuff now!!!"
322228,John,2009-03-26 14:08:00,2956,"Hey Dave, nice photo's.........you know what, I use Buffalo Airport all of the time and think that it is great! Generally quick in and out. It is one of the fastest growing airports in NA! Buffalo is a city that is undergoing renewal and has some fiercely proud residents.........you know, kinda like Kitchener."
322261,blaque,2009-03-26 15:29:00,2419,"Not to mention its only about 10 years old......and quite a little architectural mark. They could have built a box with windows but , i dunno, the comment just doesnt make sense on the airport.  The city.......you may have an arguement, still a jerky thing to say whether its true or not  And just so Im not hi-jacking the thread.........Stunning Pictures Fish'nAuto, anyplace you go from there is really gonna look like a Dump"
322282,fishing n autograph,2009-03-26 16:12:00,2540,"Okay so the airport isn't a dump....but it's a pain in the backside when they take an hour and a half to get 2 bags and a car seat off the plane...their excuse ""we're sorry, two planes arrived at the same time""  Anyway, thanks for the comments guys,"
322316,blaque,2009-03-26 17:03:00,2419, Seriously? I guess that is kinda funny
322334,fishing n autograph,2009-03-26 17:22:00,2540,unfortunately I am serious.
322337,fishing n autograph,2009-03-26 17:24:00,2540,"  I use a Canon EOS REBEL XS, most shots were taken with either a 28-80mm and 72-300mm lense"
322355,douG,2009-03-26 17:41:00,2693,"Your shots look very Flickr-y, and that means excellent.  Thanks."
