320706,fishinggeek,2009-03-23 14:48:00,325,Looking to get a swing tongue added on to my existing trailer.  Can anyone recommend a place to do this at?
320821,perodimi,2009-03-23 18:27:00,124,"Hi Fishinggeek,  I modified my trailer myself using the fold away hinge kit I bought from this supplier in Milton:  Cerka - Supplier of Fulton Fold Away Hinge Kit  Installation Instructions  You'll see that you can either purchase the entire coupler or just the hinge as I did.  After removing the electrical wiring, I cut off the tongue with a sawsall, drilled the holes, installed and torqued it with little effort. I then painted it with Tremclad to match the trailer  I think it cost about $100.00 including delivery. Make sure you order the correct channel size.  Cheers,  Peter"
320844,fishinggeek,2009-03-23 19:43:00,325,"Thanks for the info.  I'll look into it, but not very handy.  Anyone else have any suggestions?  $100 is a steal though."
321194,fishinggeek,2009-03-24 13:15:00,325,"Hate to bump.  In fact, I don't think I've ever bumped so let me apologize in advance.  But I really need this installed before the season.  Any ideas?  DIY is awesome, and trust me I would, but I wouldn't know where to start.  First thing to do is cut through the metal, and I don't even own a saw, jack stand, torque wrench, etc. that are required to DIY."
321196,lew,2009-03-24 13:19:00,12766," You can rent the saw for a few $$$$, build a stand with some scrap 2 x 4, and a torque shouldn't be needed. It's  a lot simpler job than you think unless you want it welded.  Just a thought"
321220,fishinggeek,2009-03-24 14:07:00,325,"Lew, I can't even put Ikea furniture together!    If I tried to install it, I might have to re-learn how to type if I lose an appendage."
321230,digitalkreation,2009-03-24 14:39:00,25,"There are a ton of small companies that fabricate small trailers, some guys do it out of their homes.  I bet you could approach someone like this to do it for you, they'd likely be happy to have the business."
321240,lew,2009-03-24 15:08:00,12766, You really DO need help

321751,Sinker,2009-03-25 16:48:00,8692,"If your not too far, I could give you a hand with that......it would only take about an hour or so.  Sinker"
321763,fishinggeek,2009-03-25 17:12:00,325,"Princecraft and Toronto.  I'm seriously considering trying it.  What's the worst thing I could do?  If I cut off the tongue, can't move the boat anywhere to get it fixed so I'm worried about that.  I'm all for doing things myself but I really haven't done anything like this before.  Perodimi, Cerka's website's a bit confusing.  They're pretty close so can I pick it up or do I have to get it shipped?  I emailed them and they just referred me back to the website."
321767,perodimi,2009-03-25 17:17:00,124,I don't think you can order via the website as it appears to be a catalog only. I ordered mine over the phone using the numbers they have posted. They're in Milton so I'm sure you could pick it up.  Peter
322043,NANUK,2009-03-26 01:33:00,797,"If its not too far of a drive for you I highly recommend Soldiers Bay Marine @ Holland Landing (just north of New Market) 905-953-0193 call first and speak to Paul, give him your trailer Model # etc, see if he'll do it, really worth it and not much more money then you buying all the parts and aggravation, specially if you're not handy with tools etc."
