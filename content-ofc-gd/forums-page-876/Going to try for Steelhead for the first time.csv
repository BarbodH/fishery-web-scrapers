321937,tknohpy,2009-03-25 23:02:00,162,"Hey Guys  So I bought myself a 13' St Croix with an Adcock Stanton centre pin reel.  Thinking about going out on Friday to give it a try.  Having never done this before I really have no idea where to begin.  Any pointers on where to try would be appreciated, I am living in Georgetown just west of Brampton.  Again I have never done this so any advice is appreciated.  Thanks!"
321942,drwxr,2009-03-25 23:04:00,453,erindale park is closest.
322024,rbaquial,2009-03-26 00:59:00,968,Yeah try  Erindale Park  1st...
322027,tknohpy,2009-03-26 01:02:00,162,what type of hook do I use and how many split shots
322028,rbaquial,2009-03-26 01:06:00,968,Being I've never gone... only learned from others off the board (and some in person; Thanks L2P!) I'd say... 4 split shots? 6 max? (depending on how long the lead is from the bobber) uhh.. stagger them out evenly... small hook apparently... like the ones at  LeBaron's ...  EDIT: I PM'd you TKNOHPY... Fire me an email - I'll send you a file on something posted awhile back.
322032,Beats,2009-03-26 01:13:00,543,I think the best advice is to get out there and observe what others are doing.  Pay attention and ask questions.
322045,BillM,2009-03-26 01:35:00,17367,"Shot all depends on how heavy a float you are using..  If the water is moving quickly, you'll want a bigger float with more shot to get your rig down sooner.  If you are fishing frog water (slow moving water), you can get away with a lighter float and less shot...  The key is to put on as much shot as possible without sinking the float.  You want the float to go down with as little pressure as possible.  You'll wanna run a 19-24inch lead from your bait to a micro swivel, then attach that to your mainline.  Beats has the right idea though, float guys are a pretty nice bunch, I'm sure if you ask a few questions someone will help you with your setup.  Bookmark this link.. It shows a few shot patterns that will come in handy...  http://www.fishonlineca.com/index.php?opti...9&Itemid=54"
322057,johnnyb,2009-03-26 01:52:00,3413,"Great post, BillM...I too am new to steelheading...well, not new...watched others for years, tried to copy 'em...still didn't catch anything...gave up.  I'm living down the road from Erindale now, so, I'm, ready to give it another go"
322063,douG,2009-03-26 02:03:00,2693,"Nice job, BillM."

322072,BillM,2009-03-26 02:21:00,17367," Thanks dude, but all the credit needs to go to the guru's that I've been lucky enough to fish with on a regular basis..  Make's the learning curve a lot easier.."
322082,justin elia,2009-03-26 02:45:00,151,"Hi guys, those of you that are new to steelheading, I would encourage you to join our steelhead tournament on May 2nd.  You'll definately learn alot.  Thanks.  Justin"
322165,pxtyson,2009-03-26 11:41:00,21,I can't find anywhere in the MNR book that says that erindale park is open for fishing yet.  Is it legal to fish there NOW
322166,tknohpy,2009-03-26 11:43:00,162,"Erindale is open all year from what I have read, anything south of the 403 bridge for the Credit is open."
322196,The Urban Fisherman,2009-03-26 13:01:00,2050,yeah it's open all year from the mouth of the river up to erindale for sure - i'm sure somebody will chime in and remind me which highway is the cut-off.
322200,salmon,2009-03-26 13:10:00,334,Regs have changed This year it is open from the south of HWY403 to the lake Golf course is private property (be careful)  Jose
322202,Victor,2009-03-26 13:14:00,1609,"hey tknophy have you learned how to cast with the pin yet? I'm a newbie pinner and steelheader myself and it takes quite a bit of practice at first. I have gone out a couple times now and I still can't cast that far plus i get a birdnest once in a while.  If i was to start all over again, I might start steelheading with a spinning reel first, at least I am confident with the casting and I can focus more on getting the fish to bite. I'd say it might be a good idea to get a few fish under your belt as a confidence booster before you head out with the pin if you haven't caught a steelhead before, JMHO. For the record, i still haven't caught one on the pin yet lol."
322204,pxtyson,2009-03-26 13:20:00,21,with what I have read from the MNR Regs.  It is from the 403 bridge south to the lake  nothing about erindale.  I know is used to be open all year but I cannot find anywhere to fish except from lakeshore to the the lake on river mouths.  Where are there people fishing now for steelhead as I am wanting to get out and fish but don't know where to go
