Yesterday I answered a knock on the door, only to be confronted by a well-dressed young man carrying a vacuum cleaner.. 'Good morning,' said the young man. 'If I could take a couple of minutes  of your time, I would like to demonstrate the very latest in high-powered vacuum cleaners.' 'Go away!' I said. 'I haven't got any money!', 'I'm broke!' and proceeded to close the door. Quick as a flash, the young man wedged his foot in the door and pushed wide open. 'Don't be too hasty!' he said. 'Not until you have at least seen my demonstration'. And with that, he emptied a bucket of horse manure onto my hallway carpet. 'If this vacuum cleaner does not remove all traces of this horse manure from your carpet, Madam, I will personally eat the remainder.' I stepped back and said, 'Well I hope you've got a darn good appetite, because they cut off my electricity this morning. What part of broke do you Not understand????"
