321813,hammercarp,2009-03-25 19:40:00,964,I saw one of these on the weekend. A few do manage to overwinter in the harbour here. The rest will be arriving shortly. 
321814,Lunker777,2009-03-25 19:42:00,866,hahah hmm... interesting ! haha
321817,anders,2009-03-25 19:47:00,1168,they should all be shot....despite what the MNR says...

321822,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-25 19:55:00,0,Do you teach a course on training them to fish for you?  That's some cool fishin there Mr.
321827,douG,2009-03-25 20:23:00,2693,
321832,Sinker,2009-03-25 20:30:00,8692,"Did you actually catch that while reeling in that fish???  Oh man, I would have some fun with that bird if I caught it!!!  Sinker"
321837,Pete Maina,2009-03-25 20:33:00,213,"Neat photo ... pretty amazing what those darn birds can gobble up.  Yeah, sure wouldn't hurt my feelings much if a few ended up missing"
321840,TJQ,2009-03-25 20:36:00,7806,Its too bad we hate them so much.. Nipissing is covered with them now.. unfortunately.. its not the birds fault.. like the rest of us.. they are just trying to get by...   better management is certainly needed.
321927,Pete Maina,2009-03-25 22:54:00,213,"Yeah, as TJ says, in reality, they're just trying to make a living like the rest of us. It's just what they like to eat and how much that's the bummer.  Maybe we can teach them to graze or eat mosquitos or black flies or something."
321979,bucktail,2009-03-25 23:42:00,1857,Today I saw my first flock of about 30 passing along the Oakville shoreline. I am sure there are 30000000000000000 more to come in the next 2 weeks!
321996,Rizzo,2009-03-26 00:27:00,4754,kill a few hundred thousand and give them to the homeless...or anyone who supports David Miller (probably the same people anywho)
322044,douG,2009-03-26 01:35:00,2693,"I would guess that those who don't actually have an address don't do a whole lot of voting, for Miller or anyone else, but maybe they should vote, I see your point."
322049,purekgw,2009-03-26 01:41:00,585,do they eat bread?  if so sneak so alcaselsers in there and boom
322084,EC1,2009-03-26 02:53:00,930," HAHA, I doubt it though. I think if they know how to eat walleye, they probably will stick to it since it's so good."
322090,Mike the Pike,2009-03-26 02:56:00,3421,I don't like hunting but I would take it up to balance mother nature.  Something has to be done soon that and commercial fishing on our lakes.
322133,Cudz,2009-03-26 04:09:00,2652,"those birds perch on this light above the barrie city boat launch and poo all over people, their boats, and their cars as they are putting in  or taking out their boats.  Sometimes when I am at the beach I take my kids to the boat launch so we can watch the poopfest.  It is quite funny.  I don't like them either."
322249,urbanangler1990,2009-03-26 15:08:00,933,"stupid bird has good taste, looks like a pickeral walleye?  i havent posted in AGES ummm Yea"
