I will suggest though, that the money they are going to give those who's combined family income is below $160,000.00 will be deemed as taxable income, so based on your salary, expect to pay alot of it back. Combine this new tax with the City of Torontos cumlative taxes on it's residents and I won't be surprised if down town Toronto starts to look like Detroit in the not so distant future. HH  PS.. I have heard Premier ""Norman Bates"" say multiple times to the media that this new blended tax will be ""good for Ontario"", but to date, I have not heard specifically how it will be good.

322358,irishfield,2009-03-26 17:46:00,26272,"It's all playing thru to become strictly a federal state. Corporations, as of 2009 year ends, no longer have to remit a corporate tax return to the province. They haven't been looking at them for the last 4 or 5 years anyhow. So stands to reason they don't want to look after the retail sales taxes monthly issues either.. hand it ALL over to the feds and make it an HST return instead. This is where the government lads think it's great for business... releases them from doing one monthly remittance. Problem is, it's with absolutely no renumeration for doing the governments work for them. At least the PST folks gave you a $20 minimum and up to 5% for amounts over $400 each remittance period to cover some of your time. So a business doing a million a month in sales... = $50,000 in tax collected = $2500 ($30,000/yr) refund for doing the governments work for them! Maybe this is the stimulus ""package"" as that 5% they were giving away will now go into Federal coffers.... as GST/HST gives you absolutely nothing for collecting for them!"

IF the harmonized tax work more like the GST (ie you only hand over the NET of what you take in vs what you pay out) it may actually make my life a little tiny weensy bit easier .. but I agree 100 % its the biggest tax hike in a long time because LOTS of services will suddenly become 8% more expensive ..."

I'm sure if it's painful enuf we won't forget by the next election. Mayhap the gov't in a moment of uncharacteristic consideration (read weakness) will give us a break and offer some kind of offsets or rebates - whatever - to make this whole exercise relatively painless, simply a combining (harmonization sounds so much nicer - kinda musically comforting) of two existing taxes. Look at the positive side - we'll only have one tax calculation to worry about. Of course I'm not sure how I'll calculate my ITC's now, or if I'll even be able to claim them (that alone will ding me a few grand per year).  This die is cast.

Dalton is a big boy and has never listened to ottawa in the past so why is he doing it now? he needs more of our money to spend.

That's an increase of 8% across the board on all those fees that are not eligible for the new home GST rebate.  Ontario realtors are currently lobbying hard to have them consider the ramifications - just in case they hadn't already. It's one of those things that can slide by looking like a logical combination of two taxes to provide easier calculation and bookkeeping, but it has lots of expensive impact that isn't so obvious at first glance.

The effect of tax increases/decreases on an ecomony is far from a ""simple fact of economics""...but has been a matter of fierce debate since the concept of taxation was originally conceived.  That said, any form of sales tax is the amongst the most regressive form of taxation available...meaning the less money you make, the higher percentage of tax based on income that you pay.  As usual, the middle class will bear the burden of this tax, while the rich will get away relatively unscathed.  If you want to fix the ecomony, you've got to invert that formula.  Why not make the rich pay?  They can afford it."

322300,Canuck2fan,2009-03-26 16:38:00,1444,"After reading this I find it strange that everyone is slamming the Ontario liberals for all the ""new taxing"". The truth is the FEDERAL conservatives have told the province of Ontario if you want any chance of getting what you rightfully deserve in transfer payments instead of getting screwed like we always have in Ontario you MUST harmonize the taxes.... For the majority of federal programs we put in 34 percent of the money but only get 20% or less back. So Lairity and Stevo cooked up this bait and switch at the federal level saying if you play ball with us we will start to give you back some of what you legally deserve.  Another funny thing is no one one complained about what they now pay the GST on.... Why isn't everyone writing their MP saying we are getting killed by paying the GST on this stuff. So when we harmonize the taxes it should COME OFF all these items instead of being increased by 8%. If Ontario doesn't charge it now why are the FEDS forcing them to charge it on all these new items?  I guess it is all a matter of perspective."
322324,Maverick,2009-03-26 17:12:00,371," A tax cut is an encouragement to spend money. When the economy was booming, as it was in the last 8 years in the states, people didn't need any added incentive to spend money because they all had lots of it and weren't afraid to spend it. That is why those tax cuts did nothing. Now, in these troubled times, a tax cut would add that incentive to spend money and start to revive the economy. Now by no means is this the only way or the most effective but it is, historically, a way of attempting to stimulate the economy during a recession. This along with a drop in interest rates are stimulants.  In the early 80's there was a large recession, the largest since the great depression. What did the states do, they had the largest tax cut in history. What did Canada do during that recession, dropped interest rates from over 20% to under 10%.  I agree with the second part, that the rich should pay more taxes because they can afford to but let's not forget who writes up these bills. It's the rich and the rich have rich friends so they are going to cover their own ass and not worry about the middle class. It's unfortunate but that's the way it has always been and so long as the rich are running the country, it's going to stay that way."
