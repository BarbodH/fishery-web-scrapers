322098,KelfuN,2009-03-26 03:16:00,246,"everyone's been pounding steelheads here and there and i was anxious to get out. Knowing the conditions would be tough, i still went to try my luck since this is my only day off and the rain coming this weekend will blown some rivers out..  starting at about 10am, the deepest holes of the rivers were so clear i could see bottom. headed to another trib, looked more promising..but vis was at least 3 feet  i was about to end my day early since the wind started picking up. along with the choppy water my float was going up and down on the surface of the water..  my float suddenly tilted sideways, which was weird..so i set the hook, and fish on! after about 10 seconds i realized i was using 2lb leader  i almost pooped my pants a few times when the fish took off right into the logs...i guess thats the trill with light leaders...  heres the spunky little guy, unfortunately the only fish for the day  "
322100,Joeytier,2009-03-26 03:19:00,3990,"Nice fish, and an even nicer kingpin."
322105,tibbs,2009-03-26 03:24:00,650,Nice Fish!
322107,Weekend Warrior,2009-03-26 03:27:00,27,Nice fish. And good on you for heading out in the not-so-promising conditions. I headed out today and got the skunk. Still worth it!
322110,silvio,2009-03-26 03:30:00,433,Good job bro. Were can I get one of those Columbia jackets?
322111,GBW,2009-03-26 03:30:00,8460,"same here, you could see everything in the water today where I was and was sent packing with not even a hit to show for it...  Nice fish BTW!"
322113,KelfuN,2009-03-26 03:32:00,246,give Lebaron a try..thats where i got mine. i believe they are on clearance now too 
322117,kemper,2009-03-26 03:40:00,2232,nice fish but a 2 lb leader..why oh why?
322129,silvio,2009-03-26 03:59:00,433,  When the fishing’s tough and your desperate for a fish you’ll try anything.
322134,drwxr,2009-03-26 04:14:00,453,"nice fish, i remember seeing you last saturday on wilmot by the lake, didn't know it was you."
322142,kemper,2009-03-26 04:36:00,2232,"  I, and you can quote me on this, will NEVER drop to a 2 lb lead.  Completely unnessecary ( I cant spell that word)"
322148,KelfuN,2009-03-26 05:06:00,246,"I have confidence in light leaders..  one time i couldnt hook crap all day in a pool where i knew there were fish, the minute i downsize to 2lb leader...i get 3 hits one after another."
322157,limeyangler,2009-03-26 10:07:00,5204,"Great story....enjoyed the read.  LOLOL....i dont have steelhead fishing up here, but i know the feeling when you finally hook what ill probably be the only fish of the day, and its a good one and it heads to the rocks/weed/branches.....congrats on landing it with a 2lb leader."
322199,kemper,2009-03-26 13:05:00,2232, Hey man if it works for you then thats what counts!  Personally I dont think  I could land a sunfish on a 2 lb lead with my fishing style
322201,bbnotty,2009-03-26 13:12:00,93,"Nice fish, makes it even better when you get one in tough conditions.  Berge"
322205,Victor,2009-03-26 13:21:00,1609,"Nice fish kelFun, that section looked pretty promising when i was there but I just couldn't cast that far out yet lol ..."
322211,msp,2009-03-26 13:34:00,1336,"Nice pose, with the reel on your neck............ Looks real cool!!!!! Oh yeah,nice fish too."
322260,silvio,2009-03-26 15:28:00,433, I've used 2lb leader before...
