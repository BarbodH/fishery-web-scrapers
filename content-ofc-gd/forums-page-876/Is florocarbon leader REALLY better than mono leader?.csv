322283,Bernie66,2009-03-26 16:14:00,123,"Same bait , same set ups for finicky crappie or trout, that fluoro leader definitely makes a difference.  When the fish are active, you can go with 20lb line and it wouldn't matter but when conditions are tough, any advantage helps.  Before the days of fluoro, guys with the noodle rods used to go down to 2lb leads up in some of the GB tribs and they will out fish you everytime even with a hook and land ratio of 5-1.  Now with fluoro leaders you can fish 5-6lb break strength with that 2lb visible, so why not.  I agree fluoro is not necessary in most situations, bottom bouncing niagara or float fishing some of the eastern tribes (most days). but I always have a couple of spools of flouro in that vest pocket.  Like someone else had said up top,  it is just another weapon in the arsenal."
322298,jdmls,2009-03-26 16:37:00,575,"I use fluoro mainly because it take more of a beating than mono...... Enough times I have landed fish , checked my 5lb Dennan and noticed its frayed up , but still holding.... It's more of a confidence issue for me when turning big fish,  than anything."
322307,CLofchik,2009-03-26 16:42:00,854,"Another +1 for abrasion resistance.  If you're fishing anywhere there's zebra mussels a few feet of Seaguar make a huge difference in nicks & breakoffs.  Fish like pike, laker's & coho's that just love to wrap your line you don't have to worry about so much.  I don't care about the visibility so much as keeping my tippet nick free."
322310,okumasheffield,2009-03-26 16:48:00,318,I guess it is worth the money to keep breaking off my FC leaders in snagging areas ... instead of cheaping out to use monos
322311,Canuck2fan,2009-03-26 16:52:00,1444,I wish I could truly believe that fluro makes a difference... but I just can't. I have sat beside anglers using the EXACT same setup as them and got nothing all day while they could NOT stop reeling in fish after fish. I have also seen it go the other way. That is using mono or fluro leaders so for me the verdict is still out.  I have found though that using fluro does one thing it gives a little more confidence in really clear water because the science says it should be better and it costs at least twice as much. And I don't like wasting money so I just THINK it is better LOL.
322314,Raf,2009-03-26 17:00:00,3495,don't care about the invisibility.  do care about its toughness.
322317,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-26 17:03:00,0,what do you care about Raf.....
322336,MCTFisher9120,2009-03-26 17:24:00,3761,"I have fished many clear water lakes before and never have I used a fluoro leader and i still caught fish. Untill now all i have used is mono line. Since hearing that everybody is using these expensive fluoro lines and leaders i guess it's natural for us fisherman to follow their path, to say the least if what you have been using has worked for you then why bother changing  Unless you are using braid as your mainline then you should use a leader but if you ask me mono works well and its a fraction of the cost. I know if i come across some clear water, my braid setup will have a few feet of mono on it but in my mind braid lines are good for those weedy areas of the lake so in that situation you would be fine.."
322342,Raf,2009-03-26 17:27:00,3495,whether the ice will be safe this wknd andy  other than that. not much
322450,elusive,2009-03-26 20:31:00,77,"My friend caught one 2 weeks ago using his crappy pier rod with 20 lb line, we watched his float go down and a fresh steel with his pinky....presentation IS key. I agree with silvio.   Regardless, 4lb ultragreen"
322454,Mark Kulik,2009-03-26 20:39:00,348,"Whether I'm steelheading or bass fishing -I totally believe in flouro-leaders, durability and invisibilty with lower stretch."
322462,solopaddler,2009-03-26 20:55:00,8605,"So many of you guys have chimed in saying that the fluoro is tougher, more abrasion resistant. I'm guessing you're talking the heavier lb tests for pike, musky walleye etc? 'Cause that's definitely not the case with the lighter fluoro used in a steelheading application. When light fluoro is nicked it's strength is dramatically reduced and there's no way no how any fluoro on the market is more abrasion resistant than Maxima Ultragreen. Even when that stuff feels like it's been through a cheese grater it maintains most of its strength."
322474,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-26 21:42:00,0," I hear the same thing about Floro. The only time I would use it in a river would be the Niagara...feeling the bottom/fish is what its all about. Then again, its why I use it ice fishing with braid of course. Its all about feel in these situtaion and no stretch. I use the heavey stuff for Musky just because the leader lasts for many caught fish before it gets wrecked. No leader kinks. Wire is way more expensive to use after even one pike.....did I say I pike?!?!.........huh..thought I was fishing for Musky..."
322712,steverowbotham,2009-03-27 12:24:00,1800,I am definitely a believer in fluorocarbon line.  Most of the lakes I fish are clear with pretty heavy fishing pressure.  That fluoro line is just a small tweak to the presentation that I believe puts more fish in the boat.
322734,bigfish1965,2009-03-27 13:06:00,3382,"If you are around zebra mussels, flouro is a big piece of insurance."
322748,Drew_10,2009-03-27 13:50:00,111,"Floro is also more sensitive than mono, making it easier to detect light bites and to feel out the bottom.  This may not be all that important when float fishing, but if you're dragging tubes and trying to jig up walleye it can help."
322760,charlesn,2009-03-27 14:19:00,551,"I've seen it help when fishing with 2 rods on Erie for bass.  Same tube, same weight, one has a fluoro leader, the other does not because I was too lazy to re-tie the leader with cold hands after multiple snags.  Now it could be the properties of the fluoro line and how it impacts the bait's action versus any ""invisibility"" stuff, but regardless, I'm a believer because I could even switch hands and the rod with the fluoro keeps on catching.  But that's with braid main line (because I am lazy and cheap and only want to spool up once or twice a year).  I don't buy ""leader material"" fluoro though, and since I'm only using 6-8 feet at a time on a several hundred yard spool it lasts a really long time."
322083,okumasheffield,2009-03-26 02:46:00,318,"Went fish today and got snagged so many times to the point I was thinking about using regular mono leaders who are 2 times cheaper  Have heard a lot about how great florocarbon is and wonder if it really does make any difference?  some say florocarbon is less visible ... well, how can it be proven?  some say florocarbon lasts longer ... any words from old-timers"
322085,Mike the Pike,2009-03-26 02:53:00,3421,Well I was hard head one year ago and would not use the stuff but after several fishing trips with my friend GlennK I realized he was catching 4 fish to my one.  Yes I now believe in the florocarbon leader
322088,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-03-26 02:54:00,0,"i would suggest that when the getting is good and you're catching lots you might not notice the difference but when fish are lockjaw or pressured, the low diameter/low vis fluoro might shine."
322089,kemper,2009-03-26 02:55:00,2232,"NOPE  I use good old 4 pound test Maxima ultragreen and hardly ever break off (1 fish this season, and it was my fault)  Aside from the non breaking, I also catch a  good number of fish  all sans flouro"
322091,solopaddler,2009-03-26 02:57:00,8605,"Can't speak for others but as far as I'm concerned fluoro isn't the be all and end all like some make it out to be. I use it maybe 20% of the time when steelheading only when absolutely necessary (gin clear froggy water), mono the rest of the time. Learning how to read the water and present your bait properly is way more important."
322124,shayne,2009-03-26 03:55:00,21,"""Mike the Pike"" is correct!!! So is ""solopaddler""!! I found out the hard way too!! Don't think it matters as much in dirty or highly stained water....But after a foot vis, I'm going to fluoro!! If your going to run regular mono...Go with small diameter like Ande's tournament 6lb!! Cheers"
322127,Cudz,2009-03-26 03:59:00,2652,I am going to agree with this statement.  Only reason for this agreement is the fact that Solo gets it done like nobody I have ever seen before. Much respect.
322128,KelfuN,2009-03-26 03:59:00,246,"what kemper said, maxima ultragreen is all you need."
322131,silvio,2009-03-26 04:03:00,433,Presentation is key lots of guys run straight 6 and nail them.
322138,Sinker,2009-03-26 04:20:00,8692,"It makes a difference icefishing, that is 100% for sure.  I've seen it too many times now not to believe it.  Any slow fishing days, I use it. If they are on, they're on......doesn't matter. It is much more abrasion resistant than mono too. It can take some abuse.  For trib fishing, I'd use it if it was gin clear, but otherwise, there's no need. Like already said, presentation is key!  Sinker"
322162,Randy,2009-03-26 11:21:00,115,"Along with the visibility issue, fluorocarbon leader material has more abrasion resistance. So if you are likely to be encountering any toothy critters, tie on a foot or so of FC to the end of your line.  Works for me."
322191,okumasheffield,2009-03-26 12:54:00,318,"Some old timers told me that with mono leaders, you are supposed to change them after dipping in the water for 15mins because it deteriates .... is it true?"
322198,Victor,2009-03-26 13:02:00,1609," never heard of something like that, seems pretty stupid to me. Sounds like they were just trying to make you re-tie and take your spot LOL."

322209,Headhunter,2009-03-26 13:27:00,5703,"In the big picture of things, I don't think it makes a difference... if it did, commercial netters would not have nets full of fish to pull up. If line spooked fish, they wouldn't swim head first into 100lb plus mono net strung arcoss the river or lake. HH"

I like the little bit of stretch for pickerel fishing,,,,I use braid for the main line though.  there is more than river fishing after all....  ...."
322243,kemper,2009-03-26 14:37:00,2232,  how dare you
322244,Bernie66,2009-03-26 14:39:00,123,It all depends on the type of presentation and water clarity.  If you are presenting a horizontal moving lure going for a reaction strike then fluoro isn't necessary.  But if you are drifting under a float in frog water and the water clarity is more then a foot then it can make all the difference in the world.  When the guy next to you using a fluoro leader outfishes you 5-1 then you will learn.
322247,danc,2009-03-26 14:45:00,4677," How can you be sure that it's just the fluoro that is making the difference? There's a ton of other factors that might explain why a guy fishing next to you is out fishing you. The waters that I fish make gin look cloudy, and I do ok with straight mono."
322251,camillj,2009-03-26 15:10:00,1988,I have tried both under many conditions ... I prefer the way the mono behaves ... its actually that much more supple under cold conditions which makes it easier to present naturally .. also that extra stretch allows a more 'springy' hookset ... I feel I actually break off more often with flouro (all else being equal)...
322253,Ramble,2009-03-26 15:13:00,713,"Floro is closer th the refractive index of water then mono is. That is what all the visibility clams are about. All my ice rods use floro or a floro mix. The abrasion resistance is nice.  Mono will absorb water and ""swell"". YOu can really notice the colour change in the green lines available if you have a reel spooled with it.  THe biggest advantage for those of us not on the tribs has more to do with durability. It's tough stuff, and doesnt take on water. I often use it as a leader material for my bass spinning outfit. Also made a couple worm harnesses outa some heaver floro, and then there is always the pike and muskey leaders made from the really heavy stuff.  It isnt some miracle line as the advertising would have you believe. It's one more tool in the tackle box of tricks. Can it benefit your catch...Yes, Sometimes.  -Dave"
322256,rhare,2009-03-26 15:21:00,387,"I gotta agree with whats been said, mono will work just as well as fluoro. I have been using the chameleon and ultra green as long as I can remember with great results when drifting. In fact, because I bounce more then drift I often just run stright 6# in gin clear water with no problems.         hummm"
322258,doubleheader,2009-03-26 15:24:00,497,"As is true of much of today's technology there is a time and place, although I would not use Fluoro for anything but leader material for spinning/casting/trolling or tipett for fly fishing. I don't like the way it handles in general off the reel nor the way it reacts as a trapered leader off my fly rod. It definitely is less visible in the water which is a primary benefit, and it also is abrasion resistant, I believe it also sinks and is somehat stff. A properly tied wet knot is critical. Probably more unintended variation between manufacturers in fluorocarbon than mono, especially early on in the development. When conditions allow I avoid it, when they call for it I use it."
