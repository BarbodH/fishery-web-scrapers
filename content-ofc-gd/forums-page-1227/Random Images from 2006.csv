64730,solopaddler,2007-04-25 23:00:00,8605,"Well, as I sit here in my office hard at work  , I discovered a file on my computer with a bunch of cool pictures in it from last year and thought I'd share a few with you. Some you ""may"" have seen before....not sure. Most were forwarded to me from friends, some I took myself later in the year.  June 2006 here's me lining our boat up the Kapakatongwa River north of Nakina    Our shore lunch fish caught just upstream from those rapids    Georgian Bay December Steelhead and Coho Salmon     Cold hands!    Big Water Chrome    March double header!    Georgian Bay bullets     Nice release shot    End of day festivities (that was a particularly good day  )    My daughter Riley's 3rd birthday last August    My cabin from the water and the view from my deck     30"" Walleye caught right in front of my cabin    Hope you enjoyed!  cheers,  Mike"
64736,aniceguy,2007-04-25 23:13:00,1094,Hey Mike nice pics but  the site of yours is mint looking forward to that
64744,solopaddler,2007-04-25 23:26:00,8605," Thank's! BTW, did you save me some of those smelt? I'm headed up to Georgian Bay next week to do some pike fishing and I need some for dead baiting"
64745,tjsa,2007-04-25 23:28:00,1578,"Excellent pictures.................but, why are they on your ""work"" computer,  The first two, oh, I can relate to those pictures, and some of the others also.  The fifth picture, I am biting my tongue.  The 10th picture, what a thick fish.  Your daughter is an absolute gem.  Your cabin is awesome.  I suspect you released that 30 incher.  Thanks for those solopaddler, aka Mike."
64747,mrdylan,2007-04-25 23:28:00,111,Nice pics. Your cabin looks amazing as does the view.
64755,solopaddler,2007-04-25 23:47:00,8605," On my work computer by mistake actually....although I DO have a lot of free time to putz around here.  My daughter takes after her mom  And yes, I did release the fish, although you'd never know it by the Izumi death grip I had on it!"
64763,aniceguy,2007-04-26 00:22:00,1094,more then enough smelt for that purpose heck I ll add one heck of a shore lunch to boot lol

64810,Smokey,2007-04-26 02:20:00,1278,Great pics Solo once again. Can I ask what lake you where near when up on the Kap? I've fished up there for the last 6 yrs and have been on the Kap once. It was the most consistent fishing for walleyes i've ever had with non stop fish for 5 days.  Thanks  Mike

64838,solopaddler,2007-04-26 09:51:00,8605," Sure bud, we were on Saga lake. Let me guess, you were on Jungfrau just downstream?  It's a great area, no doubt about it."
64847,Whopper,2007-04-26 10:58:00,2174,Great pics Mike! Your daughter is a little sweety! Got to tell ya though if I had a cabin with a view like that I don't think the Mrs would ever get me to return to work.  Thanks for sharing  Whopper
