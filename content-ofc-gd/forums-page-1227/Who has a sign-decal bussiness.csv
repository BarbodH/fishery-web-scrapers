64668,Landlocked,2007-04-25 18:43:00,171,Not sure where everyone is located but I just had my registration decal changed (imported Lund from Michigan) by a gentleman in Ingersoll Ontario...he did an awesome job as he was able to save the pinstriping under the old registration and also comes highly recommended by other local boaters. PM me if you need further details.
