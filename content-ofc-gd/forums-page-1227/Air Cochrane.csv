Wouldn't be hard to believe as it does connect to Kesagami by about 3km of creek, and where that creek enters the lake is near a large shallow spawning bay for pike and the Kesagami river for spawning eyes.  I had looked at Edgar before and for it's size and location you have great odds of catching great fish.  There wasn't much snow at all up here this winter so water levels may be a little lower than the normal.  The season should be about par though as ice-out is later this year than last, and, without the snow to insulate the lake ice this year, that ice seemed to freeze good and thick.  One thing to these lakes when hunting big pike in the early spring is, large baits will work and you should try them first always for bigger fish, but, early season baitfish are smallish but abundant, and so, like here on the Moose in the warming back bays you can find a good number of largish pike taking frequent small meals of fish like dace.  Don't be afraid to burn small spoons and #4&5 in-lines just across the surface.  Tonnes of voles and mice last fall.  TONNES.  It was that odd 7 year cycle and they were everywhere.  Brought lots of hawks and owls into the area.  If many vermin still survived the winter, think topwaters of the like as those little blind buggahs that tend to fall into water alot."

I suppose the walleye fishing on edgar is great.. Here is a top water lure I used on yesterday lake. Caught 15 pike in a row on these things..  Top water Lure"
64242,Moosebunk,2007-04-24 22:33:00,3970," Just the one creek out/in - not sure.  The whole region is tiaga, kinda skeg like, a sponge but more elevated than the skeg.  Run off isn't as quick in many parts, and so that's why I believe some lakes hold what they've got so well.  Same lure but in black and silver has worked well for lake eyes in the region.  Edgar should have a very subtle point about halfway up the lake on the west side.  Fishing can be good there as well as right out in front of the cabins."
