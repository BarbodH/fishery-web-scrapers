64305,Mike the Pike,2007-04-25 00:15:00,3421,"Well folks I have been thinking about this for awhile now.Having our members come up with the ultimate fishing and gear list.  Lets here from our members what to bring in the boat or shore fishing etc....  If our Adminastrators agree we could have this check list available from our website.  I have read so many posts of how the batteries in the camera were dead or the awesome report but sorry we forgot the camera and you know how much we love pics on the OFC.  We know the obvious items to bring rods tackle box etc.....   I don't know if this has been done but it would be great if this list could contribute to more successful ,safe and comfortable days on the water.   This fall we could make the ultimate ice fishing list with safety tips.  Avoid excuses for the OFC tournament be ready.   Lets all contribute.Lets here some creative ideas.  Here are some of the things I like to bring.  Hand Warmers.(ice out time is cold why not warm up those hands good for the wife and kids avoid the trip back to dock keep them comfy.  Gloves for warmth or leather for handling the big toothy critters.  Mouth spreader for pike  CAMERA (this should be the first item on your list)  Extra batteries.(what good will the camera do without power)  Extra card for video or keep your current card pics low.  Analogue CAMERA  extra film  Disposable camera keep one in the boat or tackle box this will keep the fish stories away.  Rolaids,tylenol,cough drops no explanation required.  SUN TAN LOTION  NET very obvious but how many forget it!!!!!!!!!  Rain suit  Rain poncho you can buy them for a couple of bucks and keep them in the boat or your back pack.  plastic bags ,Zip lock bags  Boots  Extra socks  Line just in case  Extra spool for rod  Key for the boat.I keep an extra in the tackle box.Sometimes make it to the boat and yup forgot the key at camp so I just take the one from the tackle box.  GAS this should be checked before going out.  Cell phone( fully charged)  Sunglasses (these can save your eyes)  A cord for your glasses If you bend over too far you won't lose your glasses.  Life Jackets obvious  FIRST AID KIT.(I also keep a few bandaids in my tackle box and yes they do get used every year.  Cooler with ice packs.  Plenty of drinking water snacks  Worms how many times have we forgot those(AND PLEASE PUT THEM IN THE COOLER)  fish scale(no more guessing)  OFNCOMMUNITY SIGN (so you won't let your team down)  Tape measure keep your catch legal and ofners honest.  Booster cables  Duck tape(in case your fishing partner talks too much)  Matches for the smokers (last thing you want is a nicotine addicted smoker wasting valuable fishing time looking for a lite disturbing other fisherman.  FISHING LICENCE(how many times have we heard that this year,  forgot my licence)  Boat licence(in my case just to pilot a 12ft tinny)  Well hopefully TJ,DanC,Roy,and Rick could post the ultimate fishing list.  now lets here your ideas.

64414,oxcowboy,2007-04-25 02:16:00,544,"great topic,  heres a few of mine that i dont think anyone has said.  a working flashlight, i got one of those wind up deals, so you never have to worry about batteries, not the brightest, but makes enough to get around some or fix something in the dark.  also a spare tire for the truck and boat.  a plug kit for a tire,  and a couple of trash bags,  they make a good poncho, plugs a hole, or helps keep in body temp, not to mention fill them with trash at your local fishing hole.  jason"
