64427,Steelcat,2007-04-25 02:47:00,191,Thanks for the report.  Nice photo~~~ The last one makes me really really hungry~!!!
64429,007,2007-04-25 02:51:00,537,Looks like you had a nice dinner!.  Though you don't get much meat off those guys.  I've never seen Bluegills that colour - they seem a reddish colour (unless its just the lighting)  Nice catch all the same. Thanks for sharing.  007
64433,Fishmaster,2007-04-25 02:59:00,920,They are more purpleish then red ..and big blue gills have lots of back meat ..and very tastey alote like perch if not better ..
64436,Dondorfish,2007-04-25 03:05:00,1000,Looks like you had a nice evening out there Steve - might give it a try on the weekend - what else might one expect to catch in the lower river ( in season ) ?  Don   Looks like lake ontario might be a wash this weekend ( winds ) so I am looking for another option.

64505,valerie,2007-04-25 12:41:00,83,"Nice fish, nice pics , good report . I think i might have to try for crappie's and bluegills one of these days looks like they can be very productive."
64514,Mike Pike,2007-04-25 13:02:00,1332,"Nice report and pics there Steve, right down to the fillets!!!  Pan fishing with a light action rod and a float is one of my favourite ways to fish.  Always takes me back to the simpler way of fishing when I was younger.  Not to mention the great eating!  I wish there were more panfishing reports.  Thanks for yours!"
64516,canadian_copper,2007-04-25 13:09:00,925,NICE LITTLE MEAL BRO!!! GREAT COLOURS ON THOSE FISH!!
