First I would like to say thank you Jen for fishing with me today...I had a amazing time.  For the people who dont know her,  she is like the perfect women..    she is into everything, she shoots, hunts, fish and by fishing I mean she will do any thing, (even take off my catfish EHEEH) and to boot a devoted mom of 3..  All I can say is WOW>  Anyway we went to Keswick today to do some  crappie fishing,   we meet at Yorkdale and proceeded to our fishing spot... Fishing today was amazing. right away Jen and I were catching fish,  a Crappie here and then 10 Bluegill in a row some sunfish and then more bluegills....  All and all between us we probally caught close to 70-80 fish...  On the way home we reliazed that we caught a huge array of different fish...  8  differnt species of fish.  IncludingCrappie, Bluegills, Sunfish, Perch, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Catfish, and Jen caught a good size Golden Shiner  Before anyone says anything the OOS fish were all released quickly and were not targeted  We have pics to follow and I would liket o thank Jen again, and lets plan something soon, mabye with your boys and I know my daughter would love to come as well..  Here is one pic, bewfore my camera died...   Dave"

64545,walking_angler,2007-04-25 14:00:00,23,"Wow,  It sounds like panfish paradise.  Perhaps I should drive out to Keswick instead of trying my luck at Grenadier Pond."

64566,setomonkey,2007-04-25 14:40:00,872,"Always glad to read reports from OFNers who hook up for fishing trips. Sounds like a fun day of panfishing too.  love_fishin and walking_angler, don't give up on Grenadier Pond. I used to live around High Park and saw a fair # of fish caught there, but in the summer. It's still much too cold, I don't think it gets good until late May or June.  Mike"

64650,David Chong,2007-04-25 17:28:00,836,"What's wrong with Grenadier Pond? I grew up in the High Park area and spend many days cycling down to and fishing Grenadier Pond. Over the years we've caught Large & Smallmouth Bass, Northern Pike, Black Crappies, Yellow Perch, Bluegills, Pumpkinseeds, Brown Bullheads, Common Carp and even Glizzard Shad. Great fishing area especially in the middle of Toronto! I still like to get down there and walk around. Cheers, Dave"
