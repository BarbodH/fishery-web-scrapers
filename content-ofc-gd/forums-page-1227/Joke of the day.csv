""I WANT YOU TO EAT REGULAR MEALS FOR 2 DAYS, THEN SKIP A DAY, AND REPEAT THIS PROCEDURE FOR 2 MORE WEEKS. THE NEXT TIME I SEE YOU, YOU SHOULD HAVE LOST AT LEAST 5 POUNDS"".    WHEN THE NEWFIE RETURNED, HE SHOCKED HIS DOCTOR BY HAVING LOST NEARLY 60 POUNDS.    ""WHY, THAT'S AMAZING!"" THE DOCTOR SAID. ""DID YOU FOLLOW MY INSTRUCTIONS?    THE NEWFIE NODDED. ""I'LL TELL YA THOUGH, BY JEASUZ, I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DROP DEAD DAT 3RD DAY""    ""FROM HUNGER, YOU MEAN?""    ""NO, FROM THE dang' SKIPPIN'.""  "
