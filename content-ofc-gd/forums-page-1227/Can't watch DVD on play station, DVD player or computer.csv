64923,motv8tr,2007-04-26 15:31:00,2587,"Hey all, I have the tackle making DVD's by reprobait lures.  I have watched it before, but on my old DVD player, which is now broken.  It won't play on my new DVD player, which says it will play DVD-r/rw, it won't play on my play station, and it seems to be messing up my compter....I can't figure it out  .  I think I've got all the stuff for making some lures, but I wanted to watch it once or twice more just to be sure of what I was doing.  Any help is appreciated.  Maureen"

When I put in the DVD for luremaking either my whole system freezes until I remove the DVD or it just doesn't read anything....very frustrating to say the least.  Maureen"
64965,Marko,2007-04-26 17:00:00,854,Try cleaning your DVD disk. If your comp wont play its either damaged or dirty or just no good anymore.
65005,PatrickGG,2007-04-26 18:20:00,562, Yep! one big or small scratch can stop it from playing if you have a P.C store in your area visit or call him and ask him if he has a machine to remove scratches off your disc i know down here some places charge 2 bucks and others 5 bucks a disc.
