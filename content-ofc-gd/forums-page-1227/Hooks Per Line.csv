64312,love2fishhave2work,2007-04-25 00:20:00,212,Does anyone know how many hooks you are allowed to use per line in the water?  Is this a province wide rule or different for each lake?
64314,irishfield,2007-04-25 00:21:00,26272,"4 and maybe that test to fish wasn't such a bad idea.  An artificial lure can have 4 treble hooks. Some will tell you there is a ""9 point"" rule...there is no such thing in Ontario.  If using bait on plain hooks, then each of the 4 hooks must be a single...or one treble and a single hook, or 2 double hooks, to = 4 points.  I won't get into the ""discussion"" on an ""artificial lure"" tipped with bait.  Some bodies of water allow 2 lines per angler and some bodies of water have barbless rules."
64359,love2fishhave2work,2007-04-25 01:01:00,212,Thank you that was very helpful
64367,Terry,2007-04-25 01:08:00,14456,but are there not lakes that have single barbless hook rules..or is that just the lodge owners making rules
64410,irishfield,2007-04-25 02:02:00,26272,"Don't know bud...guess you could browse the reg booklet. You have one...right... lol  Only exceptions I found in Div 14/18/19/25/26 are a few lakes/rivers that state ""artificial flies only"" and ""artificial lures only"" No reference to # of hooks so that would go back to the standard 4 hooks/line...but generally a fly only has one hook in most cases."
64536,walking_angler,2007-04-25 13:48:00,23,"""A fishing line must not have more than four hooks attached.  Where an artificial lure is used, each double or treble hook attached to it is considered to be one hook.  In all other situations, a double hook counts as two hooks; and a treble hook counts as three hooks"""
64602,The Urban Fisherman,2007-04-25 15:35:00,2050,"I often use two single hooks, about 6 to 8 inches appart tipped with corn for carp.  I never did in the past until I fished with an asian friend who was doing it and consistently catching more carp than me.  Cheers, UF"
