64777,ishingchippy,2007-04-26 00:41:00,33,"Well just got back from Toogood Pond.  Kids and I fished for 2 1/2 hours, 3 lines and nothin!!!  Ah well we still had fun and giggled the entire time.  Not one I wanna go home and it was pretty chilly.  2 1/2 hours fishing tonight, 6 hours sunday in Orillia.  Man for a 3 and 6 year old I'm one lucky Mum.  Not one complaint.  Going to try Walden pond on the next nice evening and make sure to hit Toogood again ASAP."
64874,Photoz,2007-04-26 12:20:00,792,"It doesn't look like an ideal weekend to gove the ol' carp gear a good work-out, and I still GOTTA get out to Queensville to pick up my bait . . ..     all 500+ pounds of it!! MY carp will be well fed! Saturday MIGHT be a decent day to try Port Credit . . . .    or even Etobicoke Creek . . . .      ANYPLACE there are carp? Anybody catchin' any down around Hammie Harbour yet? Is the parkette at Inland waters still blocked off?"
64891,Golfisher,2007-04-26 13:43:00,586,"Photoz, give Etobicoke Creek a try.  I saw a dozen or so swimming around last week, though I managed to catch only one.  They should be in a better mood now, given the warming trend.  Or at least I hope so, 'coz I'll be out there this weekend.  Hamilton Habour and the Toronto Islands have all begun to produce as well, though I heard it's been a bit slow."
63381,urbanangler1990,2007-04-22 20:56:00,933,"went out today to a local area i never tried before, was just trying to discover some nice spots, and boy i sure did, lol     caught on sinker and corn  too bad i cant add it to tourny for i dont have the logo in the pic, brought the peice of paper too, but my landing spot was quite the distance away from my bag, where i stashed it, can it still count ?"
63385,007,2007-04-22 21:02:00,537,"Well done Urbanangler. Nice carp catch.  Those GTA carp are building up for a good feed - maybe I'll target carp next, though I'm also hoping the Crappie and Bluegill start to bite in Grenadier Pond soon!  What did it weigh?  007"
63386,urbanangler1990,2007-04-22 21:03:00,933,"  i didnt have scale with me, but gotta be 10lbs at least  give them a try! their lotsa fun"
63390,dsn,2007-04-22 21:05:00,1018,Nice fish!! Heee I might be there tomorrow too.  For my second one   dsn
63396,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-22 21:25:00,181,Nice fish!
63404,canadian_copper,2007-04-22 22:03:00,925,NICE HAUL BRO!!
63512,Minnow,2007-04-23 01:37:00,177,Nice Fish! Great start for you first carp this season and they can only get bigger from there!
63517,fishindevil,2007-04-23 01:43:00,6254,"Way to go...nice fish,and they will only get bigger and badder....great pic too...cheers"
63523,GbayGiant,2007-04-23 01:50:00,1780,"AHHH, no entry for us. Don't worry you'll get us another one."
63524,DMASSE,2007-04-23 01:53:00,420,NICE FISH ALEX  MAYBE NEXT TIME FOR COUNTING   ROOKIE  DAVE
63526,Carp,2007-04-23 01:58:00,1488,"Nice carp bud, but still not as ugly as me.  Now try and get one as fat as me and you'll have a new record on your hands."
63527,MJL,2007-04-23 01:58:00,2427,Nicely done
63530,Zib,2007-04-23 02:20:00,369,"Nice fish.  I caught my 1st carp of the season as well. A 27 inch 14.4 pounder. Was actually fishing for pike on Lake St. Clair & caught the carp on an X-rap. The carp had the belly hook in her mouth, which totally surprised me. I would have thought I would have snagged one before they would hit my lure. She put up a great fight. Pulled our 12 foot tinny & turned us 180 degrees.    The carp are stacked in the shallow, protected bays of Lake St. Clair right now. Get out there if you like catching carp. My buddy also caught one about the same size."
63603,ccmtcanada,2007-04-23 11:32:00,7971,Way to go UA!  I'm going to target some of those monsters too...since no one else on our team actively does so.  Nice catch and nice pic too!
63608,Basskicker,2007-04-23 11:41:00,421,"WTG guys....I actually caught a big carp yesterday but forgot the camera, measuring tape and logo.....but they have just started to come in the river...lots of time left yet.  Jason"
63626,Mike the Pike,2007-04-23 12:23:00,3421,WTG Alex.but next time keep the tape measure and OFC sign in your pocket.With all the time you have to fish don't worry you'll have another one for your team soon.I would have to say the carp looks close to 10lbs unless you have small feet  MTP
63648,snag,2007-04-23 13:17:00,1932,"Nice Alex,  How'd it taste?"
63689,urbanangler1990,2007-04-23 14:44:00,933, like my grandmas soup   its still swimming around
63691,urbanangler1990,2007-04-23 14:46:00,933,"  yup, i put the logo in my pocket after hoping to catch another but just wasnt to be  size 9, but yea 10lbs probably"
64546,walking_angler,2007-04-25 14:06:00,23,Nice carp.  Were you using mono line?  If so what test is it?
64560,ishingchippy,2007-04-25 14:24:00,33,Nice one.  Nautifish took me fishing for carp for the first time last month in Port Dover.  I'm in Markham though.  Anyone know where my son and I can go fishin for carp a little closer to home???
64572,Golfisher,2007-04-25 14:47:00,586,Pretty much any bay in Lake O should hold loads of carp.  Try waterfront parks along the shorelines in GTA.
64633,urbanangler1990,2007-04-25 16:47:00,933,  i think its 10 or 12lb mono
64635,urbanangler1990,2007-04-25 16:50:00,933,"  like golfisher said, all along the waterfront, look for ponds, little inlets, and bays, humber bay park is good start"
64735,dsn,2007-04-25 23:11:00,1018," If your in Markham try TooGood Pond.  You'll run into some OFC'ers for sure,  dsn"
