64257,Abberz,2007-04-24 23:15:00,140,"Managed to take a couple days off from studying for exams Sunday and Monday so I hit the lake for some spring Crappie with my friend Jeff.  Water temp was perfect for the tasty little devils right in the 50-55*F range in the shallows. Both days were sunny, around 18*C with a bit of chop, but the Crappie didn't seem to mind.  Pretty much got a bite or fish every cast. Caught probably 400 fish in 2 days, in and around 1 in 4 were keepers. Kept our limit of 60 each day....I know that's alot, but we love eating Crappie and rarely keep any fish during the summer other than the occasional Walleye. Bait of choice was BPS's 2-inch Squirmin' Squirts (micro tubes) in red/white colour using 1/32 ounce tube jig heads. Jeff found out pretty quickly to lose the float and stop tipping his bait with worms would keep the sunfish away.  Here's a few pics from the outings......Kerr if your still checking OFC down in FLA I've got a ziplock of fillets for you!  First 2 of the day on Sunday.   Jeff with a couple dandy's.   Bucket O'Crappie   We think this was the biggest, but were not exactly sure.....a Slab never the less.   This was the last fish cleaned on Monday.....as you can tell from the sweat dripping off my face.     Fun couple days forsure, beats studying anyday regardless of how many you catch. Probably won't be able to get out again until long weekend in May. For those of you who go after these guys I hope you are blessed with the same luck we had!  Chris"

64262,Steelcat,2007-04-24 23:27:00,191,Nice report and photo~!  400 Crappie in 2 days?!  Man I've never caught 400 Crappie in my life
64263,Roy,2007-04-24 23:28:00,13728,"Great stuff, Abberz. Enjoy your meal(s)!"
64264,fishinfool,2007-04-24 23:29:00,366,"Abberz WTG nice bunch of Crappies. I am counting the minutes to this Fri at the cottage on Balsam Lake and hoping that these guys are in their regular haunt. I love eating Crappie more than Walleye and I always thought Walleye were unbeatable for table fare, that is until last year when I started fishing Crappie. Thanks for the pics, you got me going!!  SS"
64265,glirw,2007-04-24 23:30:00,200,I can't wait to get out there myself ! Last exam on the 28th !  Sweet report !
64267,Steelcat,2007-04-24 23:34:00,191,"This friday night will be like new year's eve for me   From the weather network, Saturday will be a lovely day, which means crowded on shore and on the lake~!"
64271,irishfield,2007-04-24 23:41:00,26272,YUMMMM..Crappie. That's darn near an oxymoron!  Looked like a great day out.
64321,solopaddler,2007-04-25 00:26:00,8605,"Impressive report and nice catch! You tired of cleaning the little buggers yet? I recently picked up an electric fillet knife strictly for cleaning a bunch of panfish. Never used one before, but am willing to try anything to make the chore easier. I brought a huge mess of perch back from Simcoe in February and it just about killed me cleaning them..."
64327,Mike the Pike,2007-04-25 00:31:00,3421,Great catch beats studying and working
64331,huntervasili,2007-04-25 00:35:00,1604,Nice slew of slabs you got there... Wtg and great report...
64338,bassmaster4,2007-04-25 00:39:00,801,nice slabs wtg
64354,Abberz,2007-04-25 00:54:00,140,"   I guess I should have mentioned that I turned my Storm electric fillet knife into a smoldering piece of plastic on Sunday. Thank god it came on the last fish and I only needed to use my regular fillet knife to remove the skin off 2 fillets. CTC gave me a new one Monday AM, and it almost went after another 60 Crappie on Monday nite.  I'll use the Storm until it craps out again, but I'm thinking of picking up the Rapala knife that plugs in and has a battery......anyone have this knife and if so good reviews?  Glad you guys like the report!"
64357,Guest mistyriver1,2007-04-25 00:57:00,0,Very nice.  WTG.
64360,solopaddler,2007-04-25 01:03:00,8605," Hey, that's the one I just bought! I'll let you know how it is when I get the chance to use it..."
64371,Rich Clemens,2007-04-25 01:10:00,3131,You said the magic words ... WITH PICS.   Ya got yourself some mighty fine lookin' slabs there  I can almost smell them cookin' up from here.
64387,Dano,2007-04-25 01:23:00,719,Now that looks like a lot of fun! Nice report.
64409,007,2007-04-25 02:01:00,537,Congrats on the nice haul of slabs. 007
64506,Smokey,2007-04-25 12:44:00,1278,"Great looking fish, I hope you enjoy the meals you get from them. Congrats."
64517,canadian_copper,2007-04-25 13:10:00,925,SWEET SLABS BRO!!!
64829,Abberz,2007-04-26 04:47:00,140,Thanks guys. Might hit them again tomorrow if it doesn't rain.  If I get out I'll let you guys know how it goes.
