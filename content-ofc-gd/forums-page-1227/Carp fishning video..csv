54456,nautifish,2007-04-02 18:43:00,1416,Hello all.  Well i have been busy starting my new video's of the season. This weekend i was targetting carp mostly and have had an absolute blast. In total landed nine carp this weekend. Joey i have another entry for our team which i will send to you shortly.  I read the other post about what do you do with your carp. I have allways catched and released my carp. How ever one of our local fish mongers here last yr let me try some smoked carp he had in his store. Allthough it was very oily it was also very tastey so i may just give it a bash and try smoking one myself this week.  Never cleaned a carp before so will have to do some reading up on it & see what i can find on the net.  Carp in England are classed as game fish and are very popular to fish for over there.  Here i know alot of people consider them as junk fish. Myself i think they are for sure alot of fun to catch.  Anyway i managed to get three epidosed done over the weekend of carp fishing and thought i would share one with you. Don't want to bore you too much....lol  Hope you enjoy the video!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3aubIxDWGo

54500,nautifish,2007-04-02 20:37:00,1416,CCMT  They are nothing like fishing for steelies.....lol But they sure are alot of fun to catch too!  Let me know how it goes.

54592,PatrickGG,2007-04-03 00:21:00,562,Nicely done Nautifish.
54631,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-03 01:28:00,181,"Nice Video and Nice Carp! I went Carp fishing before the Winter, caught a couple about that size or a little smaller. I'm going fishing at Port Dover this summer, have you caught any other fish there?"
54649,Joey,2007-04-03 02:01:00,9122,That's pretty cool.  You're getting pretty good at them thar video's girl.  Can't wait to see the new entry for our team.  Right on Naughti  Joey
54661,nautifish,2007-04-03 02:24:00,1416,  dsn our water here is probably not too much warmer than yours. However the last few days have been warm and sunny & it most certainly seems to turn them on. Friday i took my youngest out to fish with me for carp and they were jumping everywhere. I landed seven that day!  On saterday i had a female member from my board come down from markham and i took her out carp fishing for the very 1st time. That day it was much cooler and a real bite to the wind. Was also very overcast and never saw one jump all the time we were there. How ever i did manage to get her into a carp which i was just thrilled about. I will post the video for you to watch.    For sure give it a try carp are alot of fun to catch!  & goodluck.
