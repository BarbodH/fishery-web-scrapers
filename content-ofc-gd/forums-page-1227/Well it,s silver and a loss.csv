64741,Carp,2007-04-25 23:22:00,1488,Tough time to celebrate anything Brian.  Losing a loved relative is hard.  Nothing wrong with holding off the celebrations for a bit.  My condolences and congradulations.
64813,finfan,2007-04-26 02:28:00,44,"Brian, I know how losing someone you've admired your whole life can be. I lost my brother a couple of years ago and I miss him everyday but memories are good...and really the only thing that keeps me going. He not only was my fishing buddy and brother but also my very best friend as I'm sure your grandfather was to you. Hold onto those great times you had together and fish as often as you can, he will be right there with you! I go out fishing by myself and look at the seat in the back of the boat and I can picture him smiling at me saying get the net! It always brings a tear to my eye. My very sincere condolences Brian and congratulations on the wonderful milestone to you and your wife."
64825,Nemo,2007-04-26 03:46:00,727,That picture is a beaut. Your Gramps looks like a real character. Bet he could tell a tale or two.  Kudos on the Anniversary.  Sorry 'bout your loss.  My respects  Nemo

64211,misfish,2007-04-24 20:33:00,29133,"Twenty five years,man where has the time gone.  Today betty and I reached a milestone of 25 years married   . We have put off the celibration til later(thank you Wayne for your words) due to we buried the man that was my fishing buddy of all time today  . My grandfather.  I guess maybe it was a way of him to always remind me of him, but how could I forget the man that taught me along with my father. He now is in a better place with my grandmother who has been gone since 1978. I can see them now embrassed and that to me, is the one true satisfaction I will take from his passing.   Like I was told today,he is gone and not coming back,but is waiting for us to come to him. Im in no hurry,but I truely am looking forward to it."

64277,tjsa,2007-04-24 23:48:00,1578,"It is indeed sad that your grandpa passed away so close to your 25th anniversary, but it will, like someone else said here, make you remember him more often than you think. My dad passed away the day before my birthday, April 5th, so remembrance of his passing is automatic. In fact, it was also 3 days before my sister's(5 and a bit yrs. older than me, April 7th) birthday, and also right around the easter holiday, so we are always together as a family to celebrate the holiday, and the passing of my dad, who also taught me to fish. My grandfather on my dads side passed away 9 yrs. before I was born, the other when I was 6. I feel for your loss Brian.  Congratulations on 25 yrs. married. Definate milestone nowadays."

With the current situation, I'm sure that it also helps to appreciate your wife and what she means that much more.
