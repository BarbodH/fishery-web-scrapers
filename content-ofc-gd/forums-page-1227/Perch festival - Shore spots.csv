63789,HUKDONFAWNIX,2007-04-23 18:24:00,135,"Please let me clarify.....I'm not looking for any ""honey holes"".  Just general areas.  I don't live around the Orillia area, so I have no idea where to go??  Any help is greatly appreciated"

63810,FishingAdik,2007-04-23 19:04:00,14,Try the Narrows. I was there yesterday and lots of people fishing from the shore.

It's on the same street as the perch headquarters, just a couple of lights east if I remember correctly.  Park in the parking lot of the strip mall where the Subway is then you will see the path to take you back in."
64583,Beans,2007-04-25 15:01:00,3339,"Couchiching Beach Park...Downtown Orillia...where the tour boat docks...  The cement wharf near the statue of Champlain can be good...  The fishing pier outside of the Harbour Masters Building (No boats allowed)...  Great place to take the kids all year round...picnicking, swimming, fishing, playground and boat launching..."
