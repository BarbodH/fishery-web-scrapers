64289,mason05,2007-04-24 23:59:00,258,"I had the pleasure of spending the afternoon in the ER.  I was out for lunch and a buddy of mine ordered ravioli.  As he carried on about how fantastic his dish was he offered others at the table a taste.  Not being mindful of the potential poison I was about to ingest I drove a piece into the old trapper.  Moments later the sensation I fear began to show itself.  Apparently the mighty fine dish was loaded with Walnut shavings and I realized what was occuring.  Who the &%#$ puts walnuts in ravioli anyway?  Anyway, no time to mess around and ponder what the chef was thinking when he put this little beauty together.  Off to the hospital for a quick shot of adrenaline + antihistimene.  Feeling fine now and I'm not looking for sympathy with this post but I wanted to raise the point to those that have food allergies to always be aware and be sure to ask if you are not 100% positive.  Needless to say I would have been much happier sitting at my desk slaving away then spending time in the ER.  Be careful folks.  Corn Nug"

64298,Gerritt,2007-04-25 00:09:00,6129,"Hey Nug, my son also has severe allergies... they suck for sure Milk, Eggs, Wheat, Soy and all their byproducts try and find products without one of these ingredients. a difficult task for sure!! we dont know about nuts yet as he cannot be tested for them yet.. so they are taboo in our household...   Anyways, Yesterday at daycare another boy had a similar cup to my sons just a different colour, well my son grabbed it and drank the milk it contained... Needless to say we got a phone call from the lady that runs the daycare she was frantic!! My sons face swelled to about twice its size and his eyes were almost swollen shut... scared the crap out of us to say the least...  you need to be careful.. as you never know!  Thankfully my son is ok and she noticed it quickly enough that his EpiPen was not required  Liam now has brand new cups that cannot be mistaken for others.  I to suffer from severe allergies. Bees will kill me, and blackflies and Horseflies make me swell like a Beef Steak Tomato, I am also lax on carrying my EpiPen (for the bees) until I had Liam. Now it is in my truck and those I work with know exactly where it is just incase.  Glad to hear you are ok and doing better!  a lesson learned  Gerritt."
64299,Canuck2fan,2007-04-25 00:10:00,1444,Glad to hear you are OK. As a former chef I always advised any patron in any restaurant I worked in NOT TO EAT anything in the establishment if we had any of the items they were allergic to on the premises as there was therefore a chance anything they would ingest might have come in contact with one of the things they were allergic to. Lost a bit of business that way but better safe than sorry.....
64301,Greencoachdog,2007-04-25 00:11:00,8163,Too bad you can't pick your allergies... or I'd be allergic to work!
64304,irishfield,2007-04-25 00:14:00,26272,"Scary stuff... Leah's severely allergic to shell fish and even a chef that cuts her steak with the same knife he was using for shell fish or on the same cutting board and she'll be sick for days. A real hard sell to the waitress, to warn the chef, when ordering food in the Islands. We just avoid restaurants around here all together that offer sea food. Fresh water fish she has no issues with."
64318,Steelcat,2007-04-25 00:24:00,191,"I have food allergies as well, but mainly allergic to MSG (monosodium glutamate).  When I went to the specialist to test my allergies, it's so funny that almost all the food they tested on me had some sort of reaction.  Right now I'm the portable MSG tester, whenever my family and I went out for a meal, if I had MSG allergic reaction, we would mark it down and never went to that restaurant again"
64332,solopaddler,2007-04-25 00:35:00,8605, Kind of like the canary in a coal mine scenario  Glad to hear you're okay Corn Nug...
64449,carll2,2007-04-25 03:37:00,443,"got stung by a bee the other day and i swelled up everywhere, its sure not fun it hadnt gone down by much today so i went to the doctor and he gave me some anti-inflamitory pills to take its working a little bit gotta be carefull now that its bug season"
64503,jediangler,2007-04-25 12:38:00,1923,"Glad to hear you're OK. I'm allergic to skunk, especially when fishing. My face turns red and my eyes water and I begin to shake all over"
64508,OhioFisherman,2007-04-25 12:46:00,6623,"Glad to hear your OK. It is wierd how those allergies work, one of my sister in laws has no problems with dogs, but get her neat a cat and she might need the emergency room. One of my buddies had to get rid of his dog, his grandson was allergic to it, but not to cats.  I might be allergic to rednecks, never traveled south much, when I did I got a hot sticky feeling."
64510,Nanook,2007-04-25 12:55:00,565,"In Summer I take a Antihistamin a day against Mosquito bites.Swell up like a balloon if I dont. It keeps the swellings down,and helps with ITCH. 'Afterbite' helps with that."
64513,Terry,2007-04-25 13:01:00,14456,......well that's just nuts.....  so many people have allergies these days   time to start carrying an epipen with you
64515,davew3,2007-04-25 13:07:00,430,"Being that time of year with pollen and insects I have some  sinus issues. As a kid I had my allergy treatments but stopped in my teens. Well I have made an appointment for an allergy test in two weeks.  I understand just how serious they can be as both my neice and nephew have the peanut allergy.  If you have a need to use your epipens, always carry them with you. Especially if you are far away from medical help."
64535,Jen,2007-04-25 13:41:00,833,Allergies are totally scary things... From reading all the stories here it is amazing how many people you know in your everyday that could actually die from something as small as a bee or as easily found as a peanut...Thank Goodness for epi pens.
64543,Heybud_e,2007-04-25 13:59:00,208,"i myself do not have any allergies, but my son has a slight reaction to chlorine which sucks because he swims like a fish and loves pools, last year went and got him his own swimming pool for the backyard, Glad to hear that you are doing ok... Bud"
