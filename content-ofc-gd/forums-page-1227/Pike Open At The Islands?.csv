64086,snag,2007-04-24 13:27:00,1932,At this time of year all are good.  Follow the same path you took last time.
64095,valerie,2007-04-24 13:45:00,83,Thanks snog i might be up there alone so maybe i should stick to where i know.

64255,BabyHerc,2007-04-24 23:10:00,285,"I was down there on Sunday.  I was ""fishing"", but not for anything with fins  Lots of people out, and no pitbull.  I did make the call to the SPCA back in March.  I guess either they caught it, or a resident from the east side nabbed their pet.  On opening day, where ever there is water is a good bet!  Pick a ferry, and start walking and casting.  Like Snog said, you might do better to stick to areas that you are familiar with."

64540,walking_angler,2007-04-25 13:54:00,23,"I've been wondering about this for a while:  Are the Islands zone 4 or 8 (05-06 Regs p. 11)?  They are in the lake, so does that mean they are zone 8?  What about when you are fishing from shore along Lake Ontario, is that zone 4 or 8?"
64542,valerie,2007-04-25 13:58:00,83,From what i am told it is in zone 8 . Pike opens first saturday in may.
