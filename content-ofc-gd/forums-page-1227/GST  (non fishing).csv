64809,mikemcmillan,2007-04-26 02:16:00,50,I know there are lot's of smart people here so here's my question. Does GST  apply when you purchase a buiness? Thanks for the help.
64812,Dutch,2007-04-26 02:27:00,831,"Generally GST does not apply on the sale/purchase of a business as long as both parties elect for it not to apply.  See also:  http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/gp/rc4022/r...ml#P2175_208277  The rules get quite complex.  I recommend a competent tax advisor, preferably a Chartered Accountant, to advise on the specifics of the situation.  Unfortunately, it is not a simple yes or no, many variables involved."
