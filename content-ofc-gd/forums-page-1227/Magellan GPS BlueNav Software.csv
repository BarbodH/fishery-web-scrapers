I am looking to buy the BlueNav software that covers the Kawarthas area, namely Chemong, Pigeon, Buckhorn, Lovesick, Stoney, Otonabee River, Rice Lake etc.  I will be downloading the software from their web-site and want to make sure I purchase the correct software.  There are 2 possibilities that I see:  1) Lake Ontario East - Cape Vincent and Belleville to Watkins Glen and Ithaca including Oneida Lake 2) Trent Severn Waterway - Prinyer Cove to Port Severn, including Lake Simcoe  Does anyone have a Magellan unit that has purchased the software, and what one do I need?  Unfortunately, they don't have a great deal of information on what lakes are included on each set of software.  Thanks."
