64525,ccmtcanada,2007-04-25 13:19:00,7971,"Well, bly and I have been planning our weekend for the trout opener.  We've scoped out a few out of the way places and are anxious to get out there.  I was hoping for a little rain before then, since the tribs' water levels are pretty low and clear...the rain Monday night did help a little.  The weather forecast for Thursday is rain beginning in the morning, with heavy rain and thunderstorms in the evening...with localized flooding!!  Then rain all day on Friday as well...  Now...wouldn't that just SUCK if the tribs were blown for the opener on Saturday?? LOL.  Here's to hoping the tribs will be ok!!!"
64582,fishindevil,2007-04-25 14:59:00,6254,"Well you might be right cliff,from the weather we are going to get it doesnt sound very good they said we got alot of rain comming so ,lets hope it stays fishable, and lets hope the trout dont use the high water to drop back down to the lake...its gonna be a nail bitter for sure,well your post says you and carol have some places picked out so remember cliff,if you are fishing different creeks not all of them will be the same ...as in muddiness some clear quick and some will be clay coloured,and if you are way up in the headwaters it might not even get muddy or washed-out,....good-luck      cheers"
64644,jdmls,2007-04-25 17:12:00,575,"Its ok, a little mud will separate the men from the boy's... its sorta better so then Sunday when most of the 1 day a year guys are at home the water will settle and the fishing should be hot with less people !!"
64649,ccmtcanada,2007-04-25 17:23:00,7971," I hear you!  Bly and I are planning to be out on both days anyways, so hopefully if conditions are really bad Saturday, they'll clear just enough for Sunday.  Good luck to you!"
64651,Basskicker,2007-04-25 17:29:00,421,"Hey Cliff, I know it's calling for alot of rain, but where your going shouldn't be so bad....it's takes ALOT of rain to affect that creek and it will definately clear up the fastest. I've seen Oshawa completely blown and the other creek gin clear....actually I was amazed. A bit of color will do you good....those fish are awfully spooky when it's gin clear.  Good luck....who's knows I might see you the weekend. Good luck  Jason"
64652,ccmtcanada,2007-04-25 17:34:00,7971, Thanks Jason!  I'm really hoping that it's clear enough...it's a sweet spot that's for sure!  Hope to see you out there!  Cliff
