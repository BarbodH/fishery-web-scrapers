Thanks to all who entered our contest, I trust that Ann and David enjoyed themselves at the Humminbird Bass Talk held at Fishing World in Hamilton. It was nice to meet you if ever so briefly.  In the end we raised a total of $6790.00 that will divided amongst Dave Mercer's ""Casting For a Cure!"" campaign for the Canadian Cancer Society and the Big Brothers/Big Sisters ""Take A Kid Fishing"" Event being held June 23rd in the beautiful town of Orillia.  Thank you to Doug Brownridge(The founder of Bass Talk), Melanie Frost(Bass Talk's Event Coordinator), Harrison Sillen(Bass Talk's IT & AV Guru), Chris Tieber(Bass Talk Roadie), the emcees, all the lecturers, the hosts, sponsors and attendees. It was a great year, we look forward to an even bigger and better year in 2008.  In order to make things even better we would appreciate any feedback/suggestions that anyone in the OFC community might have. E.G. Would there be interest in a ""Walleye Talk"" or a multi-species session?  Thanks in advance for your input! Dave Chong"
