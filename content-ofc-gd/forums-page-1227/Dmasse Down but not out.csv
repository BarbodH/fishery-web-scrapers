62340,bowshep,2007-04-19 21:58:00,378,Just got off the phone with Dave he slipped and fell 19 steps at the Humber today. He has 2 broken ribs and a concution but the new rod and reel (Raven) are doing fine. Dave has been a very good friend to me so l have to be the first to wish him a speedy recovery and if l have to l will push him in a wheel chair to make sure he is at the Trout opener. Heal well Dave and thanks for being a great Bud. Peace Ken
