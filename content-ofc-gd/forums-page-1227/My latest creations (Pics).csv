There's been alot of trials and tribulations to get to this point.....but I think I've finally figured out how to get my baits to have super buoyancy.  Here's 3 baits that I been working on...  A 4.5"" shakey head worm   A 3.75"" buzz frog    I think this crawfish imitation is gonna be killer!!     Any other suggestions as to what colors would be worthy of trying?  Jason"
63942,kuhaman,2007-04-24 00:03:00,503,Nice work Basskicker. Ya never know what colours  are gonna work best. Make a whole bunch a different colours and start castin.
63943,solopaddler,2007-04-24 00:07:00,8605,"Good work, they all look deadly! (although the buzz frog looks kinda like a squid  )"
63944,bucktail,2007-04-24 00:07:00,1857,"I think that crawfish trailer will be really good as well, bulks up a jig nicely. Get some browns , blacks and oranges on it!"
63956,Jigger,2007-04-24 00:18:00,1237,Those things look great! The frog will be a killer!
63959,GbayGiant,2007-04-24 00:23:00,1780,They look good kicker. Did you make your own molds to ?
63960,spanky,2007-04-24 00:27:00,195,"looks good basskicker, haven't seen you much on TU lately... will have to snap a few pics of what i've got on the go  looks like you got the super floater bubbles in them... that stuff is a PITA to work with, if you found another way to keep them floating like that congrats 'cause i know i hate the floater bubbles and haven't been able to rack my brain hard enough to find something else that will work...  as for colours... trick worm, clear with large and small silver holo flakes with a very tiny amount of .008 gunmetal glitter... and some blue super hi-lite for that little bit of vein..."
63970,mepps,2007-04-24 00:45:00,1301,they look great!  i'd go with chartruse!
63976,easton13th,2007-04-24 00:56:00,371,Great looking stuff....
64656,ccmtcanada,2007-04-25 17:46:00,7971,Nice work Jason!  Thanks for the quick tour of your bait lab in your garage....it was pretty cool!
64663,Patches,2007-04-25 18:08:00,48,"neat stuff, are you adding any scent with these?"
64669,Basskicker,2007-04-25 18:52:00,421,Thanks guys....as for the molds they are CNC'd somewhere in the states and yes scent is added along with several other chemicals.  It's a work in progress....I have several different molds to pour before the seasons starts.  It's a real nice feeling when a bass smashes your bait....knowing that you made it from scratch.  Jason
64672,misfish,2007-04-25 19:05:00,29133,Nice work.  Keep it up.
64674,mattyk,2007-04-25 19:17:00,2110,looking good!
64865,Blake,2007-04-26 12:00:00,418,"Baits look great.  Go with basic colours.  For frogs simple white and black will do as you can add glitter to them to help with colour.  The craws look great look at the black blue, pumpkin with red and black fleck, brown with copper and red fleck, watermelon red fleck, and again a solid black with different glitter colours in them.  The worms look good also and the above colours would be good with the addition of bubblegum, chartreuse, red shad, junebug and white.  Keep up the great work."
