64703,vance,2007-04-25 21:38:00,719,"Its been slow for most of the day,just not sure if it is the site or the internet volume from that from that area that is the cause.   vance"
64705,Heybud_e,2007-04-25 21:38:00,208,"yep i find it slow as well, wonder whats going on?"
64707,Gerritt,2007-04-25 21:42:00,6129,who are your providers? I am with Bell....  I posted before in the other thread about the site being slow... but today it seems much worse. Took me more then a couple minutes to refresh the main page to see someone had posted to this thread.   Rick any answers yet from our host?   Gerritt.
64711,Terry,2007-04-25 21:47:00,14456,"yup, still slow here I think it's been building for 2 weeks now"
64712,canadian_copper,2007-04-25 21:49:00,925,FLYIN FINE HERE!!! MAYBE YA ALL NEED TO TURN IN THOSE ATARI'S BY NOW??? LOL
64727,Roy,2007-04-25 22:50:00,13728,Been super quick all day here........was slower a few days ago.
64737,tjsa,2007-04-25 23:15:00,1578,"Have also noticed some slowness, but not too bad. Logged in at work today(first time in a long time), and even though we have a very high speed connection, with huge bandwidth, it was slower than my DSL at home, and connection refused was experienced by me earlier this afternoon around 1:30 pm. Now, back at home, and not too bad at all, but not immediate response by any means. About 15-30 seconds for pages to start loading at times, but most load up within 15 seconds."
64739,spanky,2007-04-25 23:16:00,195,"was horribly slow here too, on sympatico highspeed here, never seen it so slow before?"
64750,Daplumma,2007-04-25 23:35:00,1961,Was painfully slow this afternoon but is just fine now. Joe
64752,silveradosheriff,2007-04-25 23:41:00,1025,Fast at work and through Rogers!
64791,Gerritt,2007-04-26 01:07:00,6129,Well whatever it was the site seems to be ALOT quicker now....  pages are loading fairly quickly...  Lets hope whoever is getting DDOS'd (distributed denial of service attack) has become bored and given up...   have a great night folks.  Gerritt.
64796,Roy,2007-04-26 01:32:00,13728,I just did a chrono check fer de heck of it and I'm getting a page refresh in less than 2 seconds. I'm with Videotron cable.....not the best of providers.
64799,easton13th,2007-04-26 01:37:00,371,"Not the quickest it has ever been, but nothing out of the ordinary....Source cable Hamilton is my provider...."
64800,GbayGiant,2007-04-26 01:48:00,1780,I'm still on dial up and the pages are loading in less than 6 seconds.
64822,bigfish1965,2007-04-26 03:39:00,3382,"I don't know if they moved us to another server or not, but things seem okay now. It was ugly for a bit, but other than let them know things are hooey, not much I can do."
