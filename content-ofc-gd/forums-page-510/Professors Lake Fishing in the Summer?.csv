444501,tschirk,2010-03-16 23:33:00,261,"I've only caught perch there. You need minnows. Look for big rock on south side of shoreline, near centre of south shore."
444541,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-03-17 01:40:00,0,"Haven't been in awhile though Lots of LM bass, very few pike and tons of carp."
444647,charlesn,2010-03-17 14:06:00,551,"Not sure if the ice is gone yet, but right after ice out the perch were in shallow thick.  Caught probably 50 from shore on the west corner with grubs and micro tubes.  Biggest probably not even a 1/2 lb and most tiny.  Not sure if safe to eat, but don't really eat fish anyways.  Caught some incidental largies too.  Saw some carp.  Never seen a pike there yet.  Good luck."
452150,Shaolin,2010-04-05 18:41:00,1,"I persoanly caught pumkinseed and rock bass but I 've seen carp(HUGE) LM bass, yellow perch too There are a lot of people who have caught pike and sucker fish here too. ROCK BASS is easiest to catch I never come home without atleast catching one . I usecorn as bait but worms are good too Good luck:)"
564490,rbaquial,2011-03-22 14:21:00,968,I just moved to Brampton coincidentally - I'm going to be fishing that lake heavily this season!  I'll keep you posted.  1st target of the season - Black Crappie!
564586,ricoboxing,2011-03-22 17:49:00,398,"i grew up fishing that lake in the 80's. we used to catch bass, and sunfish/perch. back then there werent any crappie or pike in that lake. used to ride our bikes there and fish all day in the summer."
564665,pidge,2011-03-22 20:47:00,438,"Bramptoinion here as well. Fished there, but never knew there was such a large varity. More popular for its paranah"
565560,jimmer,2011-03-24 18:56:00,2730,Ontario Record Largemouth Bass came out of that lake. Unless someone wants to correct me.
565562,ADB,2011-03-24 18:57:00,444, You're thinking of Preston Lake in Stouffville.
565564,jimmer,2011-03-24 19:00:00,2730,Thanks for the correction. Still close though when looking at the bigger picture :-)
565566,ADB,2011-03-24 19:02:00,444," Lol, I'm sure the community that lives around Preston would love it if the trespassers starting going to Professors instead."

572127,rbaquial,2011-04-14 13:21:00,968,Can anyone confirm if they've ever caught CRAPPIE out of that lake?
572165,Hairpy,2011-04-14 15:56:00,73,yup
572171,mbosh1980,2011-04-14 16:19:00,349,Tons of carp you say?...
572519,rhymobot,2011-04-15 13:29:00,174,  Lots of crappie from shore but pretty small. I don't target them but I've seen people catching them and nothing bigger than your hand from what I've seen.
572758,rbaquial,2011-04-15 23:31:00,968,"Blah, its the closest lake to me. I just need to get rid of this ""Itch"". LOL  EDIT: There's no CREAM for it - I've checked!  (Thought I'd beat y'all to it - before someone said it!)"
581722,rbaquial,2011-05-11 12:38:00,968,Just wondering if anyone has been to this lake recently and tried to go fishing? I'm planning on going there this Saturday (May 14th) -  Just looking to doing some Ultra-Light Fishing...
592503,rbaquial,2011-06-13 14:03:00,968,...I was there on Friday Afternoon - LOTS of CRAPPIES Going to be heading there again NEXT friday!
604384,rhymobot,2011-07-19 15:45:00,174,"I always understood that you weren't allowed to fish from a boat, just shore, in this place but I went for a dip a couple of days ago (turquoise water on a hot day) and saw some dude fishing from a bass hunter. I called next day and sure enough you can now fish from boat but only you're own non motorized. You can't fish from one of their rentals.  BUT, you have to launch from their boathouse for 5 something and it's 10-7 everyday. They give you a flag and when 7pm comes they bring you all in. They have a motorized boat to come get you if you're late. And you're not even allowed to launch a dingy from the park on the opposite side. Not even the residents whose backyards are on the water are allowed to launch without notifying the rec centre."
604892,peter23,2011-07-20 22:41:00,95,"i went a year ago or so and actually went inside the water up to our hips and caught lots of perch,rockbass and pumpkinseeds. there is bass and pike but they absolutly have tons of huge carp. everytime we were in the water they would come right beside our feet but we were never able to hookup with one. we tried corn and everything"
605243,rbaquial,2011-07-21 23:15:00,968," Just outta curiosity, where did you get this information? God, sounds like such a money grab for the Rec. Centre!!"
605302,rhymobot,2011-07-22 02:29:00,174," Spent 5 mins on the phone with them. Apparently the city owns the water! About 3 years ago I launched from the park just for a stroll, no fishing, and she came up to me in a powered boat and said you're supposed to register with us first! But at that time I don't think they had flags and all that.  Heart Lake isn't as stingy as Profs. when it comes to rules but I never have good success at Heart Lake.  I guess places like Wilcox are ideal for cheap skates like me. Free and lots of fish."
