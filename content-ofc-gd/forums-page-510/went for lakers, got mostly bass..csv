On top of that i discovered that i have mysteriously lost 30 feet of anchor rope???? The rope was long enough to anchor in 90' FOW last summer, i used the rope to secure a tarp as a boat cover for the winter and now its 30 feet shorter??? weird. Anyway this restricted me to around 55 FOW with not much to drift and get a good set on the bottom. I did manage a few small ones...but the bigger ones i guess were on the 65-70 FOW shelf nearby.  After about an hour or so of fighting my anchor and bilge pumping i decided to cast for bass....lost a really nice one that snapped through 10lb braid on a run.  Going to the same lake this afternoon with a buddy to try for anything willing to bite (except mosquitos)   <iframe width=""560"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/vmpuSbsMFoc"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>        "
