605126,lunkerbasshunter,2011-07-21 17:48:00,2585,ok not to be to negative here but I hope they make boats to target more then just the walleye pro.  if they dont they will end up out of biz as soon as they started.  They should make a few different models that meets the needs of all anglers not jsut the pro walleye guy.  Heres hoping they make a go of it!  Cheers!
605136,Roy,2011-07-21 18:10:00,13728,Well there's certainly something to be said for specialization...singleness of purpose.
605153,craigdritchie,2011-07-21 18:44:00,1586,"What Roy said. If you build the same thing as everyone else, then you are always facing competition on price. If you build something that's a bit different and unique, then you can charge whatever you want because people won't have much to compare it to."
605163,grimsbylander,2011-07-21 18:57:00,3016,"Niche market businesses are usually more immune to the outside influences of competition and copying. That said, I wish them all the best and though there is always market share for a true quality boat, the US economy is struggling still and boat prices reflect that. Great looking boats in the pics."
605208,canadadude,2011-07-21 21:07:00,769,"This is great news...Warrior boats were one of the Pioneers of the modern Walleye boat aswell as the big tiller models. They made a very good quality boat and have always been one of the elite walleye boats on the market. As for why the buisness folded is unclear, but not surprising many boat manufactures have folded, changed hands and have gone through fincial instability. It seems to be the way the business is, boat manufacturers have alot of dollars tied up in materials, inventory and overhead at most times. It is also a very competitive business and one or two slow years can really strain the company."
604474,craigdritchie,2011-07-19 20:31:00,1586,"The Warrior brand of fibreglass multi-species fishing boats has been pulled from the fire, thanks to four Minnesota businessmen who have announced a relaunch of the company.  The new owners, led by pro walleye angler Dave Anderson and former Warrior dealer Joe Hellerman, announced they have purchased all rights to the Warrior name and trademark, along with all molds and tooling. The new company is now searching for a factory location with the intention of having new Warrior boats available for sale by the end of this year (December). The new company will employ about 10 people, including key staff from Warriorâ€™s previous ownership.    In short press release, the new owners state they plan to sell the six most popular Warrior models (sorry, they didn't specify which ones) with all others available on a special-order basis. The group is now looking for prospective dealers in Canada and the US.  At its peak, Warrior was producing about 300 boats per year, targeting the professional walleye market."
604498,glen,2011-07-19 21:57:00,2641,That boat in the pic with a DC would be nice.
604501,BillM,2011-07-19 22:06:00,17367,That's a BIG tiller!  lol
604505,TDunn,2011-07-19 22:25:00,680,Back when I was working at Eagle lake a ton of guys from texas all had warrior boats. OnlY time Ive ever seen them but they were sweet....
604510,Roy,2011-07-19 22:49:00,13728,I hope the DO come back full tilt. That pictured tiller is an excellent fishing boat.
604521,irishfield,2011-07-19 23:19:00,26272,"I have factory space and a town full of glass experts if they want to locate in Penetanguishene. Our factory is currently in the old Grew building, but we have room in our old facilities down the street!"
604523,misfish,2011-07-19 23:20:00,29133,"Any word on prices? Looks like a sweet ride,even for a tiller."
604524,GBW,2011-07-19 23:23:00,8460,Was that also Northstar boats?
604528,irishfield,2011-07-19 23:25:00,26272,"Not sure Geoff... our 26,000 sq ft building was Grew's last presence in town, with a nice fancy 32' ceiling, board room, offices etc. They went into receivership and the guy that was shot and killed over in Owen Sounds last year had bought the rights and was making Grew's along with something else, maybe it was Northstar?"
604530,misfish,2011-07-19 23:26:00,29133,  Pass the Wisers me son.LOL
604533,irishfield,2011-07-19 23:28:00,26272,Come'on.. who'd drink that crap... El Dorado Silver Deluxe here.
604536,GBW,2011-07-19 23:31:00,8460,"I think Northstar sold the hull molds to Grew when they went under and they were in that plant you are talking about Wayne.  Then Grew moved in.  The Grew 7 doors down from my folks looks 100% like my dad Northstar but in blue and it's 2 years newer.  Craig, any ideas here?"
604539,irishfield,2011-07-19 23:34:00,26272,"Grew built the building we're in specifically for themselves as they had to get off the waterfront and needed ""our"" building to do the larger boats. Full overhead rail system throughout the entire facility to move moulds/hulls/finished boats."
604542,GBW,2011-07-19 23:36:00,8460,"ahh, I see.  Craig, you know what happend to Northstar?  Not to derail this post though..."
604567,craigdritchie,2011-07-20 00:57:00,1586,"GBW - sorry, I don't know exactly what happened to Northstar. I'll dig around a bit and see what I can find.  In the meantime, Misfish - no word on pricing. They don't even have a factory building finalized at this point. The new owners only got the company in the last week or so.  I never got to drive one, but I've seen a few of these Warrior boats and they were pretty nice looking rigs. They seem to have been very solidly built."
604594,Dutch,2011-07-20 01:50:00,831,"I wouldn't be buying a boat from a Company that has previously gone out of business.  If they go belly-up again, good luck with warranty support."
604606,Roy,2011-07-20 02:42:00,13728, Would you prefer doing business with a manufacturer who's still in business but doesn't honour its waranties?
604618,Dutch,2011-07-20 03:15:00,831," No - but, I'd do my research beforehand so I wouldn't have a boat from a manufacturer that fit into this category, Tracker, for example."
604621,GBW,2011-07-20 03:18:00,8460,Thanks Craig. Geoff
604622,GBW,2011-07-20 03:20:00,8460,"PS, the reason I ask is I would like my next fiberglass to be from the same MFG as the Northstar is Amazing!  over 10 years old and not a 'spider' mark on it and we do use it alot."
604732,craigdritchie,2011-07-20 14:49:00,1586,"GBW - Sorry man, I can't find anything on Northstar."
604734,mike rousseau,2011-07-20 14:56:00,4661,From what I've seen these are really nice boats...  www.walleyecentral.com  Always has a couple for sale in there classifieds...  And big tiller boats rock... Tons of room...
604764,misfish,2011-07-20 16:12:00,29133,Hang on baby.  https://www.walleyecentral.com/classified/new/adviewer.jsp?adv=14807
604769,Roy,2011-07-20 16:24:00,13728,"That, is my kinda boat!!!!"
605124,lunkerbasshunter,2011-07-21 17:44:00,2585,"the only concerning thing to me is that they are keeping the 10 key employees?  What where they ""key"" in if the company went under?  I do hope they make it profitable."
