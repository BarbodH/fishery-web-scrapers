Nothin better than good company, and time with the girl who I don't get to spend a whole lot of time with because of the steady midnight shift. Sun was hot and the fishing was not. Trolled 2 hours in 57 to 61 fow with one barn yard animal(sheephead) to show for it. Decided to run out deeper to find the fish. Out to 67 fow about 15 miles out and the finder was lit up with hooks. Unfortunately only one more sheep to show. Lots of fish but not even a sniff. Thought for sure the bows would be on fire with that hot sun but I guess not. 8 miles out water temp was78 deg F and 15 miles out 80 deg F. Almost 10 deg more than 2 weeks ago when I was out last. Anybody else try Erie today?"
