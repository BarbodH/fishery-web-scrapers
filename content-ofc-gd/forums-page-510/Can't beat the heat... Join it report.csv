605217,mike rousseau,2011-07-21 21:43:00,4661,Well... I had the afternoon free... So I decided not to lay on the couch and beat the heat... But go out on the river and join it...  And was I glad...  In three hours I boated 12 walleye with the biggest being 8lbs... 2 smallmouth bass... And a bonus little 32 inch musky  Yes it was incredibly hot and the 30mph winds were a headach as well as a blessing creating huge waves but also giving me the odd cold shower wich was refreshing...  And I couldn't find anybody willing to fish with me...  But I had fun and drank about 3-4 liters of ice water in those 3 hours...  Now time for some beers...
