604972,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-21 02:02:00,336,"Keep posting pics like these.  I'm drooling over them.  Just saying that I'm looking at them in Colorado and if I even got a whiff of anybody looking to go to St Lawrence, I certainly would recommend Musky Mike as their guide.  I know that I would enjoy fishing with you.  Seem cool and always on fish.  Good luck in your endeavors.  Slayer8"
