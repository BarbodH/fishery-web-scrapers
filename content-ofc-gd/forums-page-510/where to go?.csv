605202,peter23,2011-07-21 20:53:00,95,hey guys i am planning a trip for muskie on monday just to go out for the day with my dad but im not sure where to go? we were thinking pigeon lake but i was wondering if you guys had any ideas of some lakes i should try. this will be my second ever muskie outing my first one was on upper buck and had tons of luck. so just shout out any lakes you guys think i should try. ANYTHING will be helpful.  thanks
605209,rhymobot,2011-07-21 21:09:00,174,My friend has caught tonnes out of waubashene. And several non target pike and bass.
605215,BillM,2011-07-21 21:39:00,17367, Tonnes?  Tonnes of muskie and GBay really don't belong in the same sentence.  Especially this year.
605296,rhymobot,2011-07-22 02:15:00,174," This is going back about 6 years. He showed me the pics. He caught 26 in 12 hours of fishing.  I went with him 2 years ago and he pulled in 3 in 4 hours of fishing but I got skunked.  However, was also there last weekend for 3 hours and got none but pulled in a 2.4 largie and 24"" pike between the two of us. So I guess this year what you say is true. Didn't know it was a trend this year."
605298,irishfield,2011-07-22 02:19:00,26272,40 miles trolled every time we're out... guess I've gotta start following your friend!
605355,johnnyb,2011-07-22 12:41:00,3413,Maybe it was just tons.  Not tonnes.  Muskiemaniac....it's hard to argue with success...I'd have a hard time not going back to Buckhorn based on your first trip there.  But lots of other lakes....I've found the SCugog muskie to be co-operative...not always huge.  I've never fished Balsam...but I think it's next on my list.
605377,mike rousseau,2011-07-22 14:11:00,4661, wow... thats gotta be a record or something... a musky every 30 minutes for 12 hours...
605378,mike rousseau,2011-07-22 14:12:00,4661, what area are you from...?  that would help
605397,Gregoire,2011-07-22 15:19:00,1397,I second going back to Buckhorn. Do the same thing as last time. Once you figure out a pattern on one lake take that expertise to another lake. This will also give you an opportunity to fine tune your techniques and still hopefully have some success.
605403,muskymike,2011-07-22 15:48:00,772," He must be the most successful Musky fisherman ever, especially in Severn Sound. He is a god apparently.  Wayne, if you find this guy, I will be following you, I know what your boat looks like.  Bill had it right...  Now to help the OP. If its only your second trip out for Musky stick to the Kawarthas. Stay out of Gbay until you build some confindence, or it will eat you up and spit you out. Pigeon is a fun lake to fish, this time of year the north end is very active, you shouldnt have a problem boating any, search around this form, other guys have stated where to start. < Very poor sentence structure haha. If not, try Upper Buckhorn. Lovesick is too small, and I find if you do go to Stoney, fish where you think Bass and Walleye will be and you are into Musky.  Good luck!!!!"
605409,peter23,2011-07-22 16:17:00,95,thanks guys and ya im going to stick to the kawarthas  i liove in the caledon area so i dont mind a drive back up to buckhorn or pigeon.
