605088,rhymobot,2011-07-21 15:22:00,174,Can you rig a trolling motor to just any canoe or do you need a canoe that has a kind of flat surface at the end to support the mount?
605092,johnnyb,2011-07-21 15:41:00,3413,You can make a mounting bracket for it to hang off the side....but how much faster will you really go than by paddling?
605095,mike rousseau,2011-07-21 15:48:00,4661,You can mount them on the side...
605097,BillM,2011-07-21 15:55:00,17367,"Side bracket for sure.  And Johnny, you definitely go faster, especially when the canoe is loaded down with 1000lbs worth of fishing/camping gear, lol."
605100,mike rousseau,2011-07-21 16:01:00,4661,Do you actualy need a bracket???  Why not clamp it on the side of the canoe near the rear???  They swivel 360
605102,K_F,2011-07-21 16:12:00,107,before i had my sportspal I used 2 c-clamps and a couple pieces of wood - this makes a  sturdy base for the trolling motor to sit on.....I would just make sure all my clamps and my motor were on tight....and i offset the battery to balance the canoe
605131,BillM,2011-07-21 17:58:00,17367, The side of the canoe isn't meant for clamping an engine to.   It also wouldn't be vertical..  Either side bracket or a squareback.
605194,johnnyb,2011-07-21 20:23:00,3413,  Hahahaaaaa...good point.  I was just thinking of a day-outing
605199,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-21 20:53:00,0,works great as long as there's very little wind.  get any kind of headwind and you'll have a tough time going straight.
605212,mike rousseau,2011-07-21 21:28:00,4661, I have a cheap old transom mount that can do it without a bracket...  You just put a towel over the side of the canoe to prevent scratches from the clamps...  Tilt the motor till vertical  Set your height...
605216,vinnimon,2011-07-21 21:42:00,2593,I will take a pic later of my back rest/ bracket. I use the battery to balance the swampfox
605297,rhymobot,2011-07-22 02:17:00,174,very interesting...  would love to see that pic too.
605301,ohhenrygsr,2011-07-22 02:27:00,947,Back in the day. What i use to do was use a piece of wood and put it between the inside of the canoe and I would clamp it down. Of course the canoe was an older one but man it worked flawlessly. Just make sure the shaft clears at the lowest point of the hull. Most trolling motors have different trim settings.
