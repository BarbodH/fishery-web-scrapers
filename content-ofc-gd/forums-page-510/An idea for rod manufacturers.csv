Last night I caught a nice largemouth, and didn't have a tape measure with me, so I laid the rod on the ground, laid the fish next to it, and noticed that when the tail was at the butt-end of the handle the mouth was exactly at the forward edge of the little 'Shimano' sticker on the rod shaft. Measured that when I got home to satisfy my curiosity. But it got me thinking; why not just make a rod with measurements on it? Not all of us take a tape with us when we're fishing, but experience tells me that most of us have a rod. (Or am I missing something there too?  )"
605068,Joeytier,2011-07-21 14:12:00,3990,That's actually a good idea.  real good.  Never thought it...
605078,Gregoire,2011-07-21 14:44:00,1397,Too bad you mentioned it on a forum otherwise you could patent that idea. It is a really good one. I'm thinking you could paint onto your rod and lacquer it if you wanted to do that yourself.
605107,Live2fish85,2011-07-21 16:45:00,1633,It has been done before I have seen them and have a buddy that has one on his fishing rod. Good idea though just to bad it was already used.
605109,umKthxbye,2011-07-21 17:00:00,247,"Wow, that is a nice idea. I'll actually do this on my next custom rod for bass, so 24-36"" would be enough. Just need to find a nice measuring tape decal stick it and resin."
605110,lunkerbasshunter,2011-07-21 17:03:00,2585,Yes it has been done already. I used to have a fly rod when i was a teenager that had one on it.   Rapala used to have one as well but not sure if they still do.  Cheers!

605128,Roy,2011-07-21 17:50:00,13728,They already sell those...hard to find though. They're usually in the Barbie/G.I.Joe aisle.  How about a retractable tape right in the butt...as it were.
605132,Dave Bailey,2011-07-21 18:01:00,1641, Hope it's well lubed...
605133,Dave Bailey,2011-07-21 18:02:00,1641, COOL!
605155,craigdritchie,2011-07-21 18:45:00,1586,Did they not have that on some version of the Pocket Fisherman? I seem to remember it.
605168,Roy,2011-07-21 19:09:00,13728," Yes they did, Craig. The original plan was to print it right on the rod but then they realized that folks would be limited to 5"" fish."
605276,nroadrunner,2011-07-22 00:54:00,113,They do or did as I still fish with a Zebco measurin stick I bought in highschool.  It measures up to I believe 15 inches on the pole and has a tape measure wrapped in the butt.    Ian
605289,cram,2011-07-22 01:59:00,1733,"Maybe it's me, but why not just carry a tape in your pocket?"
