605134,Headhunter,2011-07-21 18:08:00,5703," I know that I may we be in the minority here, but I for one would much rather be doing what we are doing in the above pic, then fishing pretty much any other way, on a day like today! Anyone else wish it was minus 15 out right now! LOL HH"
605139,John,2011-07-21 18:22:00,2956, You're a sick man Joe
605142,craigdritchie,2011-07-21 18:27:00,1586,I'd rather have a barbed wire enema than be forced to go ice fishing.
605143,mercman,2011-07-21 18:29:00,7054,"Nice HH The beauty of -15 is you can always add layers.The disadvantage of heat, is you are not allowed to go to work naked  "
605145,Dave Bailey,2011-07-21 18:32:00,1641,"I used to think that ice fishing was nothing but beer, dirty jokes, and flatulence, but then it struck me - what's the downside of that?  But seriously folks, although I often feel like going it's not something that I dare do. Ever since some bad water back in the early 70s gave me IBS the cold is one of the things that can set it off, and if the Imodium chooses not to work it puts me in a very painful and frightening condition. Bring on the heat!"
605146,Dave Bailey,2011-07-21 18:34:00,1641, She's waiting...  
605147,Slop,2011-07-21 18:34:00,151,I'd prefer to be ice fishing over this hiddeaous weather any day!
605149,Roy,2011-07-21 18:39:00,13728,"Love, ain't it grand? Ice fishing..isn't that where you crawl out a warm bed next to your beautiful wife to go sit in a cardboard box on the ice at -35C?"
605156,Headhunter,2011-07-21 18:48:00,5703,"There you go teasing again Roy! Craig, I'd rather have my ""fellas"" hanging over the gunnel of a boat, being massage by midgets with a paddle, then be out in the crap we got going on today! How's that for a visual for yah! (And before Irish puts his two cents in... yah, I'd be wearing the gloves! LOL) HH"
605158,mercman,2011-07-21 18:51:00,7054,   I just pee'd a little........................excuse me.
605160,kenzy31,2011-07-21 18:52:00,261,I would be in without hesitation!! My absolute favorite season to fish is winter. I put in more time on the ice than I do in my boat just for shear cost and simplicity. BRING ON THE ICE!!
605162,Terry,2011-07-21 18:56:00,14456,"I can't take the heat anymore, I find myself come off the water by noon lately because of the heat  I hate to say it but I am starting to like winter more then summer  really"
605176,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-21 19:28:00,2690," Tell us how you really feel, Craig"
605179,irishfield,2011-07-21 19:45:00,26272,"Come'on Joe... it's not that bad out there. I just walked Sinai, down Gerrard, down Yonge to the Eaton Centre and back. The scenery was astounding...... and the oxygen tank they have me on now is great!!"
605184,crappieperchhunter,2011-07-21 19:53:00,2582,Yep a nice winter day drillin holes and nailing perch would suit me just fine right about now  I got all the proper cloths to stay warm and toasty even on the worst winters day...but there is nothing you can do to make a day out in this enjoyable. Even a nice swim  only cools you off for 10 minutes. By the time you towel off your already starting to get hot and sweaty again
605186,fishnsled,2011-07-21 19:58:00,3520,"That's great pic Joe. Couldn't agree with you more. Sitting in an office with the air conditioning broken today, thermostat says 30 degrees now and it's been climbing for the last hour. Will it hit 35...40?? Thankfully I'll be out of here in the next hour or so...."
605187,OutdoorDan,2011-07-21 20:00:00,325,You just need to find the right profession. Luckily for you they just legalized it....
605402,mike rousseau,2011-07-22 15:45:00,4661,you guys are crazy... i hate winter... there isnt enough safe ice in my area and where there is is overrun with other anglers...  im in my boat from late march to mid deceber most years and love every day of it...
605426,johnnyb,2011-07-22 18:16:00,3413,Bring on the ice indeed!!!
605428,Spiel,2011-07-22 18:17:00,9065,Works for me.
605581,spincast,2011-07-23 10:36:00,3279,not for me thanks. the scenery is much better at 30 than -15  far to many people cant drive in snow and even if you do know how its just a pain I hate shovelling - but dont mind cutting the grass the daylight hours are not long enough The heat doesnt bother me and cold however seems to find me no matter how many layers I put on
