604623,Diltsy,2011-07-20 03:22:00,22,"I put together a fishing video from my last outing from shore. Thought you guys might like to see it. I filmed it by myself so it was difficult to get everything in there! I won't even get into trying to edit it on my slow computer, lol. Hope you enjoy. The next one will be better, I promise!   "
604626,GBW,2011-07-20 03:30:00,8460,DUDE!  Great video and who is that you used for the music?  i can't stop humming that after a few views.  GREAT JOB!

604676,Dave Bailey,2011-07-20 12:25:00,1641,"Excellent production values, you should be doing a lot more of these!   At the bottom right it says Foo Fighters, Stranger Things Have Happened."
604696,Fish Farmer,2011-07-20 13:19:00,2234,"Very good,   should I ask, is that what you do for a living? That stuff should be on TV  . Make a good commercial for product."
