604219,TDunn,2011-07-19 02:18:00,680,"Hey guys! I haven’t had a ton of time to do any reports lately and honestly I don’t have a ton of time to do a long write up now! So I will just post some pics of some trips lately.   Fished for a few days up at camp in Hornepayne.  Mike landed the first fish of the trip.                   triple header with three species     I must say Highdrifter(OFC member) ties some wicked fluoro leaders! I used one of his the whole trip on my pike rod and never had to change my leader once. It must have seen 50 pike (biggest 39"") and it didn't need to be changed once. If anyone is looking for some quality leaders. I would suggest you contact Highdrifter.  Finally found my way into some trout lakes while at camp. They were beautiful, crystal clear lakes with a ton of potential. We fished a brookie lake for 2 hours in the morning and a lake trout lake from about 12-3pm the same day.  We had some descent action for brookies but the fish were small. We landed half a dozen or so all between 10-14""...     went 2 for 5 on the lakers.           Havent been in the rapids for awhile. Last time I was there was the last week of june. Spent the afternoon chucking spinners and small spoons. Hooked up with a few of these   and one a little bigger    Ive also spent a small amount of time on the river chasing Atlantics. 2-3 hour stints here and there is about all I can get away with right now.            Nice steelie mixed in with the atlantics   Ive hit the river at night a couple times looking for some eyes. Found a few but it hasn't been a very good start for the walleye anglers from shore. I think that the weather this week will help them out.            The only bass fishing around the Soo I have done this season has been from my kayak. Im running a Hobie Mirage Revolution. What a sweet ride, I can't wait to get out and put some real time in with it. If anyone has any interest in the Hobie Mirage (pedal drive) kayaks, please PM me if you have any questions.  The bass were active but I never picked up any fish much bigger than this       Yesterday we tried our luck out on Lake George. We caught a mixed bag of walleye,pike,perch and sheepshead on bottom bouncers and crawlers. Fish hit on both the inside and planer board rods. Only caught 1 fish on a crank which was an eye.            Only perch were kept for a meal!   Hope you enjoyed!  TDunn"

604265,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-19 06:46:00,0,sweet action.. i was wondering where you were.  the downtown bite has been dreadful this year but i got into some fish finally tonight including an 8+ lost at the boat.  it would have been my first big fish out of the river this year... oh well...  how's the atlantic bite been?  i never seem to make it out on the river until after 9pm.

604944,highdrifter,2011-07-21 01:06:00,2534,Almost missed this one!  I hate it when good fish porn gets pushed back into oblivion before I can get to it..  Anywho another banger of a report brah.  Summer chrome is normally reserved for the elite or those who have the ressource..  You my friend are part of both categories.  Thanks for the big upps too!!  cheers
