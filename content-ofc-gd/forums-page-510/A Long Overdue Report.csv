Never got around to posting it, so here goes: Not being a hard-water fisherman, I was pretty keen to get out again  after a long winter. It was a good thing the season opened on a Sunday, though, because there was lots of plumbing, carpentry, stacking of firewood, and the usual chores that need to be done to get my pal's cottage opened up. I keep the place running, and in return, he is very generous in making it available to me to use.  Chores done, a beautiful morning greeted my first day of fishing:    My first hit of the year!   Things got busier. Besides quite a few OOS footballs, the pike were on. These guys made it to the fryer:   I found a beaver dam I hadn't noticed before:   The pond looked great for bucket mouths!   I got to try out my new Veritas; a great rod with stout, but even flex. This one's a 7' MH; a medium is in my future, I think.   The next week was warmer, and featured bigger, if somewhat fewer fish. Being out on my own meant the obligatory self-shot with this 40 incher Friday afternoon:    Saturday, another good fish ate my perch X-Rap, a pb 41 incher:   It was a great couple of weekends to open the season. Since then, the bass have taken over from the pike in some of my spots, but I'll save that story for next time. Hope you enjoyed the pics, Chris"
