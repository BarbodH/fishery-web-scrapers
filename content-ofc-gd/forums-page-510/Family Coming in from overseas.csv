They have both rented a cottage on Clear Lake off 118 in near Bracebridge. Just wondering if anyone has fished this lake / knows this lake and can advise what I may find there fish wise. . Going to check the MNR website, but not real confident of the reliability factor there. Thanks.  "

605213,spincast,2011-07-21 21:36:00,3279,"Thanks guys - MNR web site says ----- Lake trout Brook trout, bass , pike etc etc etc. Pan fish and bass will work for me."
