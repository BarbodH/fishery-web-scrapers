604430,Stef,2011-07-19 18:34:00,63,"I tried to keep it short  , but it's not and the photo's are quick snaps without concern for reflections, etc but they serve the purpose.   A user review of DownScan Imaging (DSI) as represented by a Lowrance Mark 5x DSI.  This is a new unit for this year and is the cheapest Lowrance unit with DSI, black & white, 480 x 480 screen with 16 level greyscale, 500 watts RMS, about $300-350 but at time of my purchase Lowrance was offering a $50 rebate.  Comparison photo's are with my dash mounted Hummingbird 717, blk & wht, 320 x 320 screen, 16 level greyscale, 300 watts RMS, about $225.  It's a lengthy review so if you don't want to read further the bottom line is it's not worth buying at this time.   For those that don't know, Lowrance Electronics was recently bought out by Navico,  with new product starting with the HDS series and limited support for the original Lowrance/Eagle products many of us grew up with.  This comparison is not about Lowrance vs. Hummingbird, the 717 is very similar to an Eagle 480 I previously had with equivalent output and comparable technology.  It is about DSI (also offered by Hummingbird) which promises ""picture like detail"" and displays very convincing shots in its advertising.  This is reportedly achieved by use of higher frequencies, 455/800 Khz vs older 83/200 Khz design and new methodology whereby the scan is done in close focused slices rather than a conical beam (like a flashlight pointed down, the conical beam spreads out further as it goes deeper, covering more of the bottom).  For this review the Hummingbird is at its tightest 20 degree pattern for most detail, also display is reverse greyscale while the Lowrance is set to normal greyscale and both units are tuned for maximum capability as far as individual controls allow.   I bought it because I'm primarily interested in structure fishing by drifting with a jig for walleye and looking for the ""spot on a spot"", so the advantage of seeing in greater detail what is directly under the boat is obvious.  The higher frequencies and ""slice"" technology would seem to be able to provide this, as sonar is simply returned radio signal or echoes.  If it were possible to focus normal units to perhaps a 10 degree pattern it would also enhance my view but its not available.   The new Mark 5x allows 455 Khz ( a wider coverage) or 800 Khz (narrower coverage).  Pictures are off the 455 pattern.   Initial findings:  - Useless manual covering many units with no info  - Very limited ability to set up the unit, signal strength is done via setting contrast, no chart speed, no ping rate, etc.  - Greyscale levels (16) not visible, you basically get black or white and that's it.  The colour units for much more money are similar, your colour choice on a black background only, unlike present units which change colour depending on signal strength.  - Harder to determine actual fish, but possible.  - Viewed closely, there is more detail, especially around dramatic structure such as a cliff face where you can ""see"" into the shadow unlike normal units.  - Many have reported being unable to view anything at speed, set up properly it works fine on my boat.  - The transducer is cigar shaped rather than normal ""bar of soap"" but fits in existing mount, no new holes needed in hull.   Pictures: These were taken one after the other in the same location and while the boat moved between shots you can usually make out the same objects .....    Photo of Mark 5x on deep flat showing both 800 and 455 KHZ view   Same shot of Hummingbird 717    Shallow water with 4x zoom on Mark 5x   Same with Humminbird 717   More complex structure with zoom Mark 5x   Same with 717   Mark 5x with structure   Same with 717  The bottom line is that I think the technology is not yet far enough advanced to make it worth purchasing.  There is far more bang for the buck with a normal style unit."
604437,BillM,2011-07-19 19:02:00,17367,I wonder why Lowrance would put all that high tech into a system without a HD colour screen..  Seems like a huge waste.  A buddy is mine runs a HD Humminbird and all the side/downscan imaging is unreal...
604472,Stef,2011-07-19 20:24:00,63," They have an Elite unit in colour for about $600-650 (sonar only, no GPS) with DSi but it certainly doesn't work like an HDS unit.  Same pictures as the cheap one but you can select red or yellow instead of black, looks pretty and maybe more visible in sun.  Its all about what they can sell, more people buy cheap than top of the line stuff........"
604476,aplumma,2011-07-19 20:33:00,6896,I can not speak for the Mark V DSI series however the HDS7 with the LSS-1 does not even come close to looking as poorly as the unit you are using. Once set up correctly using the extensive array of controls and settings you can read the water like no other units I have seen to date. If you find you are not impressed with the Mark V I suggest you look at the more expensive units before you write off Lowrance for me it has been the best electronics I have used on the water. Thanks for the report on Lowrances cheapest DSI unit it seems they need to do some work in a few areas before they continue selling it to the public before the ruin their DSI name.   Art
604489,Stef,2011-07-19 20:57:00,63,"I don't think I would spend the money for the unit you mention, which is over $1600 in Canada plus tax, but heaven knows I spend a lot on fishing.  But if I had the chance to do it again I wouldn't buy the cheaper Lowrance... or Hummingbird.... DSI units at this time."
604496,Fisherman,2011-07-19 21:40:00,7201,"A nice report, maybe I'll just keep my old beater for another year or two."
604507,aplumma,2011-07-19 22:38:00,6896, While expensive it is a valuable tool I use for fishing and depth sounding on the bay and ocean. It can at the correct settings differentiated between a school of Rock Fish and a school of Shad. The ability to locate Blue Catfish hanging on the wood or mussel beds and separate the targets is a tool that makes trips more productive. While anchored you can see the fish move from their location as a streak and when you drop anchor the turbulence shows up as a ghost of bubbles and after words the anchor line is visible. While this unit is not for everyone because of the cost it is technology that is light years ahead of the depth finders of yesteryear.  Art
604511,Pikeslayer,2011-07-19 22:54:00,1443," I'm with Art.  I have the same set up (as Art) and it is so far advanced vs. your unit shown. I don't use the LSS much on lake O, but on the lakes in Seguin it is an awesome tool. I'll save some screen shots on my card and post at a later date. It is day vs. night compared to what you are seeing.  Slayer."
604552,Nipfisher,2011-07-20 00:17:00,2449,WAR lets go out in my boat and I'll show you my HDS unit. No DSI but I have it set up to see all the structure and fish. I have an old Lowrance X55 on the bow. It is a decent cheap old finder that is great for depth but that is all I use it for. I'll be upgrading it next year. I am looking for a used HDS8 or 10 for my consul so I can move the HDS5 to the bow and network them.
604558,aplumma,2011-07-20 00:33:00,6896,If you are on the latest update 4.0.? you get the option of a 3 screen split on the HDS7. It may be on the others but on the 7 you can run the 200hZ with the 800HZ and the map all at the same time. I have used the 200hz set at return levels to just shadowing a firm bottom and when the signal drops out you have found weeds or mud. With the 800hz you can confirm the weeds and set it to just showing the weeds and any mid water returns that are soft returns are fish with hard returns being wood or debris. The info is endless with these units and the more you play with them the more you understand how powerful a tool they are.   Art
604560,Nipfisher,2011-07-20 00:37:00,2449, The 3 screen split is not available on the HDS5 unit. I am on the latest update though Art. I loved it for ice fishing with the portaable power pack. I can see my 1/4 jig hovering about 2 inches above the soft bottom.
604681,Court R,2011-07-20 12:46:00,213,My Humminbird HD with down imaging is awesome! you can see so much more with it.
604733,mike rousseau,2011-07-20 14:49:00,4661,I was looking at hummingbird hd di and it looks like an awesome combo for 600$
605602,Terry,2011-07-23 17:11:00,14456,"the photos are not very good..too much sunlight and reflections but check them out   <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=P7230003.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/P7230003.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>   <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=P7230005.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/P7230005.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"
605646,mike rousseau,2011-07-23 22:48:00,4661,  that looks pretty good... you like the unit?
605650,Terry,2011-07-23 23:15:00,14456,"I love it  but I really want the hds8...maybe a 7 but I have been using 7 and 8"" older coloured units when I got the 5"" hds I found the screen a little small then add the side scan and gps and it's not big enough..I went back to my 25c for the gps giving me a 7"" screen then just the fishfinder and scanner on the hds 5 helps but still too small for me...hds8 will be great..  but the hds5 is the best portable icefishing fishfinder I have ever used....I would take it over and flasher or finder for the ice    "
605674,lhousesoccer,2011-07-24 00:30:00,442," ??????  Sonar only, no GPS?  Have you actually looked around? They sure do have a Sonar/GPS colour combo in the Elite line.  Pick up any BassPro or Cabelas catalogue, or get online.  $650 USD.  Lowrance Elite-5 Sonar/GPS Chartplotter.  My link  I have two of these units are they are incredible.  I have no opinion on the cheaper black and white model you're running, but what you say about that unit certainly doesn't go for the colour DSI chartplotter model I'm running.  It is amazing what I'm seeing on this unit."
