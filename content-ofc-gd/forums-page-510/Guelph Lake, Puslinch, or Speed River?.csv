605411,fish_finder,2011-07-22 16:58:00,370,"Bass and Pike in all of the above, pickeral in none.  Belwood lake has some picks.  Theres a huge festival at guelph lake this weekend, so I wouldnt recommend going there to fish......I'll be out there for the tunes and the beverages though"
605425,GreenCanada,2011-07-22 18:10:00,375,"I have found the activity in Guelph has really slowed down with the extremely hot days the past two weeks. That being said, you might be able to slam some bass or pike in the Speed Saturday evening just before the ""rain"" rolls in, if it actually does.  My suggestion for lure selection would be a kitchen sink, as they might very well hit everything, including the above mentioned sink."
605432,rhymobot,2011-07-22 18:22:00,174,Thanks guys. By the way where do I launch in the speed river? I have an inflatable. Is it a slow current? And deep enough not to beach myself after all these rainless days?
