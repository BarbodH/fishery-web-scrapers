Yes, he hit the back of the car...    These two guys came flying down Bay St. yesterday.  One has a powered chair and the trailer person doesn't so he just holds on for the ride.  Nice way to get around if you ask me...  "

605080,Gregoire,2011-07-21 14:49:00,1397,"That would be funny, but if you see a guy walking down the street in a banana hammock please hold off on a pic."

605226,skeeter,2011-07-21 22:13:00,1907,"Are you kidding me? I would have worn a pink one with rose's on it today, It helped block the heat from the grills."
