545370,danc,2011-01-30 04:23:00,4677," 5 years and 3 weeks to go for me until I dip into my two pensions. Why two pensions? Because we maxed out our first one as far as government contributions are concerned, so we started another about 15 years ago.  And I've not put a nickel into my retirement fund. It's all been paid over my wages.  Just a few more points to make here. I'm not a RAH RAH union guy. I couldn't care less if anyone reading this is union or not. What gets my hackles up is when I read threads bashing unions. Then you're bashing me, and that's when I get involved. When I finished high school some 35 years ago, I had a decision to make. What would I do for a living? I liked working with my hands and brains, so being a tradesman made perfect sense. I looked into it and saw that a union tradesman made damn good money, pension and benefits. Pension being the biggest thing. I guess what I really want to know from the union bashers is, just where did I do wrong in my career path?  All of which reminds me. I should make an eye doctor appointment Monday. I need a pair of polarized bifocals so I can see what I'm doing when I tie my jig flies on. And I should go to my chiropractor and see about this sore neck. Maybe time to see the dentist too.  After all, they're all paid for. I might as well take advantage."
545373,Jonny,2011-01-30 04:40:00,1380,"I'm a retired teacher (which I suppose might inspire cat-calls from some, but I'm pretty sure I was a damn good one!) and I know for an absolute certainty that without a teachers' federation (glorified name for a union), I would have had neither the pay I did during my 35 yr career nor the decent retirement income I have now.  So I sympathize fully with DanC's view.  Unions are NOT an unalloyed blessing (I'm quite aware of the drawbacks), but in employer/worker relations they can make a difference."
545377,Grimace,2011-01-30 05:07:00,2020,"I am not a rah rah union guy either. It is just that I have enough intelligence to understand that the fellas at the other end of the bargaining table are smart enough to concede that they too would be in a union if they were in my shoes.  Hence the various construction organizations that the companies join.  Do I begrudge them that.  Nope.  Do you union bashing type begrudge the ""sewer and watermain association of Ontario"" their right to gather and discuss the rates of pay for employees the rates of equipment rental, the formats in which permits are handed out, the way in which the municipal governments are lobbied to ensure desirable zoning for development. ??  So why would you begrudge me and my tradesman peers the opportunity to do the same.  Safety and certification and has not even entered this conversation yet?  A whole new ball of yarn.  For instance.  A construction worker is 8 times more likely to die on the job as a cop.  It use to be much worse.  My grandfather founded local 183 labourers union after he fought in the second world war.  The main factors for him in the 60's and 70's was SAFETY.    I am a member of the international union of operating engineers local 793.  Local 793's training for crane operators is second to none.  We have people from all over the world coming to our union school so they can take the knowledge home and teach it to their peers.  We are making jobs safer."

They get a bad rep, but if you the majority of employees (at least the ones here in Simcoe) they say it's a very good company to work for. It's part time, they cant offer everyone 40 hour work weeks, but they say it's not bad."
545000,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-29 04:40:00,4399, I have full disability coverage too without  a union!  Since you like unions so much tell us all about how the unions helped bring America's largest corporation too it knees and then beg for Billions to save their jobs!

545010,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-29 05:22:00,0," i worked under the same union through food basics.  they are NOT a good example of a union by any means, but  the fact that your wife makes min. wage etc. is not the fault of the union, it's the employer.  in order to get around paying a decent full time wage, the majority of their staff IS part time, because they can LEGALLY pay them less.  they also don't have to provide them with benefits.  my particular store would work us at almost full time hours (at just above min. wage), then suddenly drop our hours to maintain part time status.  outside of department heads, there are hardly any full time jobs left in that industry.  people wonder why the service industry has gone to hell. maybe it's because the people in it aren't paid enough to care."

Why not truly adress the real issues. Global trade and our wants,aka goverment borrowing ,has placed north america to bow down to cheaper imports.Truthfully the organised labour haters,would jump at the chance for a decent wage and benefit package..it used to be 1 wage would suffice for families. ist. it OUR wants before our needs."

545093,Fishnwire,2011-01-29 16:35:00,983," Do you think that's the case with most workers, or is it that you are fortunate enough to have something that most do not?  I don't know what you do for a living, but I'm a tradesman and can tell you that working for a unionized company almost certainly involves receiving better compensation, higher safety standards, and greater job security, than working for a non-unionized one.  As another poster asked, ""What's wrong with that?"" - Also...I wonder if because so many non-unionized employees had things like disability coverage, it become reasonable for unionized employees to start asking for it...or if it happened the other way around? - If you don't want to belong to a union...I could care less.  Other than to wish you good fortune, I'm genuinely unconcerned with what agreements you have with your employer, or how you reached them.  Why is it so hard for others to feel the same way?"

Blaming workers for the problems facing their economy is like blaming soldiers for the bullets that are fired at them.
545099,Billy Bob,2011-01-29 16:50:00,5865,Unions are good in the private sector but NOT in the public sector like those who are taking us to the cleaners in NYS....they make more money and get the BEST benefits AND tax FREE pensions without having to compete with another company....our taxes are the highest in the nation and MANY MANY MANY corporations have moved out of NYS taking their jobs with them to avoid all the taxes imposed on them.....now tell me how good public unions are....I am all EARS for this one.

545103,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-29 16:53:00,0," as a former canadian public servant i will say this is not true on our side unless you are talking the top 10% of the public service.  personally, i left the public sector because the wages are not up to par with the private sector, and because i was on contract, my benefits were non-existent.  i WISH CUPE had the testicular fortitude to stick up for guys like me in the ""entitled"" public service."
545107,Billy Bob,2011-01-29 17:02:00,5865," Our public sector is completely out of control....the police have found a loop hole in their contract that the last 2 or 3 years before they retire they work all the overtime they can and it can boost their pension more then the regular pay.....so all the guys not up for retirement would turn down the overtime and give it to the older guys getting ready for retirement.....our new governor is suppose to look into this as this was just one of his platform items when he was running...but we all know how this just gets forgotten over time.  When ANY NYS public sector employee retires their pension is FREE of ANY NYS taxes....oh, they only pay into their pension system for the first 10 years and after that the taxpayer pays ALL cost....I could go on and on and on and on and on.......just plain corrupt."

545115,Grimace,2011-01-29 17:15:00,2020,"The non union workers can thank the unions for everything they get because they have to at least try to compete with the union rate and benefits (to which they still are not).  The media and corporate interests have everybody believing that the unions are bringing the industries down but as was previously mentioned that it has more to do with the fact that factories can pump out a lot of garbage products in China for very cheap.  How are those workers doing you ask?  Well what do you hear about human rights, freedom of speech, democracy and quality of life in China?  Negative things I am sure.  Mexican factories are closing down and moving to china because $1.75 per hour is just too much to pay for these corporations.  Are the horrible unions in Mexico that are demanding $1.75 per hour ruining it?  Or are the greedy corporations squeezing until there is nothing left?  If the guys at a GM plant in Michigan were making  $2 per hour and they moved the plant to China would you then say.  Oh look the bloody union tried to suck too much out of the company."
545125,Jonny,2011-01-29 18:13:00,1380," This is something that people find hard to understand, for some reason.  The other mind-set that seems to be difficult to break is that businesses operate with their workers' interests as a significant consideration. Businesses are first and foremost about making money and providing their owners and management with a good return. Workers are often treated as a necessary evil.   "

545302,lunkerbasshunter,2011-01-30 00:11:00,2585,Walmart is a customer of mine.  I also work for a company that is owned by a walton.  What they created was what society wanted.  If people didnt want lower prices on items they never would have survived.  All they do is provide items that people want to buy at lower prices.  And it was society that drove them to buy chinese product.  They did not wake up one day and say hey lets go to china to get our product.  Manufacturers brought them product that was cheaper then what we could make here.  If you think Walmart was to blame for manufacturing and small business going down in north america your wrong the people that shop walmart are to blame.  All Walmart did was provide a service that people wanted.  I know many of there employees at head office and at store level and although they have there issues like most major corporations they all say they get treated fairly as long as you do your work.  Some managers make some really good money and they have some decent benefits and holidays.  Better then alot of companies.  Anyway CPH I am glad that they can help make you some extra cash.  Overtime is almost a part of the way things go now a days in the working world.  I bet majority of us on this board put in our overtime weekly  Cheers

544942,Jonny,2011-01-29 02:28:00,1380,"Sadly, my principles take a back seat to my budget when shopping.  I know it's a tough go for local small-business retailers, but I only have so much discretionary income, so if I can find something cheaper at Walmart or on eBay, that's where I'll buy it.  Even Walmart has its competition for price on certain things.  Latest example - an SVGA cable for hooking my laptop to the TV. Walmart price - $25. EBay price - $3 (including shipping). All I have to do is be patient and wait for the mail. For the $22 that stays in my pocket, I can do that.  For me, a local retailer has to sell stuff I can't easily get (or have shipped from) somewhere else. Or he has to provide value-added service or warranty.  I just can't afford to go any other way, unless the difference is negligible."

I found one on Ebay for a buck and a quarter. Less than 5 bucks to my door from the US. I too shop around and don't care where I buy from. My hard earned money is better in my pocket than anyone elses.

Even though I have plenty of time to do so, because I'm off work due to an injury that occurred off the job…and I'm still getting nearly full pay.  I happen to work for a company that is unionized, but I'm sure that has nothing to do with the short-term disability coverage I am currently making use of.  Probably the folks at Walmart and the like have the same plan, as most employers would eagerly offer to cover such an expense out of the kindness of the hearts, and not because it's their obligation under some sort of collective bargaining agreement."

If you put in about 26 hours of OT you are owed a week off with pay.  You have to be compensated for OT hours worked at a minimum of 1.5 times your regular rate.  Your boss doesn't have to give you the option of banking hours or paying them out, but he has to do at least one.

543852,JohnF,2011-01-26 18:45:00,3494, With all the bad talk about Walmart I'm amazed anyone goes to work for them. What am I missing?  JF
543859,jedimaster,2011-01-26 19:01:00,3472,Not alot of places to work for in small towns when all the local shops lay off and close up the doors you gotta work somewhere. I know in keswick allot of local stores have been hit pretty hard by wallmart opening up.
543870,JohnF,2011-01-26 19:21:00,3494," Aren't the big box stores just a sign of the times? How often right here on OFC do we see posts asking for tips on where to get the best prices on gear, boats and motors? How is that supportive of the local small retailer?  The majority of surviving (even succeeding) local retailers are probably part of a buying collective for purchasing power and better pricing. That's already a move in the direction of consolidation under a major label.  I can understand why employees and owners of small retailers are upset at the idea of the Walmarts moving in but for every one of them how many locals are pleased to have greater selection and cheaper prices?  I'm afraid it's a losing battle.  JF"
543876,fishing n autograph,2011-01-26 19:32:00,2540,Must be nice to have OT....even if I'm busy I have to ask f permission for OT...
543877,misfish,2011-01-26 19:32:00,29133,"  It,s like you said,best deal.A couple of bucks here and there ok,but when I can go to WW and get fat rap jigs for 4.99 and the local is charging 8, thats a big savings when your buying 4 or so of them.HT rod and reel combo 14 bucks,25 else where.Sad they are in tough,but like said,losing battle."
543880,Spiel,2011-01-26 19:36:00,9065," Oh I agree John, it would definitely seem to be a losing battle and once all the local manufacturing jobs are gone where else can you afford to shop?  For my part I will never set foot in a Walmart store. I will ask however (rhetorically) what % of their inventory is American made?"
543882,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-26 19:42:00,4399,"Hey Walmart fills a niche market and they employ a lot of people that well lets face it may be unemployable for anything else.  I am sure there are a lot of people working there that appreciate the 10.25 an hour like seniors looking to supplement their pensions,you take away Walmart where are these people going to work?  I myself look forward to becoming a Walmart greeter one day!!!"
543883,misfish,2011-01-26 19:43:00,29133," Chris,you could ask the same about all the big stores.Canadian tire aint no dif.Future shop?Does anyone call a tv repair guy anymore? Hell,is there any?"
543884,Fishnwire,2011-01-26 19:43:00,983,"  Don't sweat it...I think that's the case for most people.  There are not a lot of employers that offer their employees unlimited OT to be worked at their discriction.  Having to ask, or more often...waiting to be asked, is the norm."
543963,JohnF,2011-01-26 22:17:00,3494, Dunno. Is it much less than what you buy at your local shop?  JF
544022,Fisherman,2011-01-27 00:57:00,7201," Last info I got the other day, 92% made directly in China and another 4% made by Chinese companies in other countries, sooo, guess that doesn't leave a lot over."
544024,danbouck,2011-01-27 00:58:00,4380, The people who work there think it's a great place.
544029,Rod Caster,2011-01-27 01:14:00,5784,  do traffic control... easy money if you are at the top of the list.
544062,Gerritt,2011-01-27 02:02:00,6129,I have the option of unlimited OT... but then again I am a small business owner.. so it is part of the norm now.. 14 hours yesterday and 12 today.. Ohh joy..
