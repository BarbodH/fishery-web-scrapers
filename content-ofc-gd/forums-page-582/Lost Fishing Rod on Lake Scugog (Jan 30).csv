I started walking out from Goreski Landing... and when we got to our spot, I found out I lost one of my fishing rods. I tried looking for it very hard around the area and on the way back with no luck.  If you found it, please let me know... I'll try to come up with some type of reward... The rod and reel is not anything of high monetary value, but the reel has been with me for over five years and it carries sentimental value to me...  here are some details Rod: Bob Izumi Medium Heavy Reel: Daiwa Emblem S spooled with Rapala Titanium Braid, there's a swivel snap on it as well...  If anyone of you are going for fishing on Scugog and found the Rod, please PM me... greatly appreciated  Long"
