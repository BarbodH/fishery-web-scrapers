Postal  'Service' Telephone 'Service' Cable TV 'Service' Civil  'Service' State, City, County & Public 'Service' Customer 'Service'   This is not what I thought 'service' meant.  But today, I overheard two farmers talking and one of them said he had hired a bull to'service' a few cows.  BAM!!!  It all came into focus.  I now understand what all those agencies are doing to us.  Now you are as enlightened as I am!"
