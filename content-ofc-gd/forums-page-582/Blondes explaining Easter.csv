He told them that before they  could enter the Kingdom, they had to tell him what Easter represented.  The first blonde, an American, said ""Easter is a holiday where they have a big feast and we give  thanks and eat turkey.""     St. Peter said, ""Noooooo,"" and wouldn't let her in.  The second blonde, a Brit, said ""Easter is when we celebrate Jesus's birth and exchange gifts.""     St. Peter said, ""Noooooo,"" and he wouldn't let her in either.  The third blonde, a Canadian, said she knew what Easter was, and St.Peter said, ""So, tell me.""     She said, ""Easter is a Christian holiday that coincides with the Jewish festival of Passover. Jesus  was having Passover feast with his disciples when he was betrayed by Judas, and the Romans  arrested him. The Romans hung him on the cross and eventually he died. Then they buried him  in a tomb behind a very large boulder ... ""     St. Peter said, ""Verrrrrry good.""  Then the blonde continued, ""Now, every year the Jews roll away the boulder and Jesus comes out.  If he sees his shadow, we have six more weeks of hockey.""  St. Peter fainted.  HH"
