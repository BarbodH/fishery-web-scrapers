545642,cityfisher,2011-01-31 01:57:00,959,"After running around simcoe today and gathering tones of snow in my tub due to a couple cracks in the plastic, I now need to do some plastic welding , any recommendations on where to get an inexspensive plastic welder in the gta??"
545664,chilli,2011-01-31 02:17:00,199,Epoxy?
545667,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-31 02:22:00,0,apply drywall tape across the damaged areas and try epoxy?
545732,irishfield,2011-01-31 05:19:00,26272,"Almost impossible to get anything to stick to polyethylene. I've had marginal luck using an old gun style soldering gun.... the HD ones with the 1/8"" square looped wire ""nose"". You'll need some sacrifical polyethylene to melt in, just like soldering pipe with lead. Melt the crack and add/melt filler as you go. Heat/melt/smooth/blend. A fine line between getting it to melt together.. melting a big hole or having a cold weld line that will just crack again."
545739,blue pickeral,2011-01-31 09:01:00,267,Mr. Sticky Poly-Bonder  http://a-a-i.net/polybonderuses.htm  or  If it is ABS you need epoxy with methocrylate in it. Permatex makes this.
545745,bushart,2011-01-31 11:23:00,2628,Just watch the fumes----welding plastic is extremely hazardous to your health besides being a carcinogen.  With so much plastic in the average home---this is why so many people die in house fires by the fumes  Years ago I was a tradesman and welding plastic was something we had to learn in trades school.  If it was me---I'd find an alternative
545746,2advanced,2011-01-31 11:35:00,53,I would use jb weld
545832,cityfisher,2011-01-31 14:59:00,959, I stopped by  Walmart this am and picked up 2 different JB welds.  http://jbweld.net/products/water.php & http://jbweld.net/products/jbweld.php  Not sure which one im going to use but I will give the repair a test this weekend on quinte
545838,2advanced,2011-01-31 15:06:00,53,The second one is good enough.. I would make the crack bigger (wider) and both sides with coarse sand paper and apply on both sides and fill the crack
545847,wallyboss,2011-01-31 15:20:00,1095,What I did was drilled holes on either side of the crack tiewrapped it closed then I put on some Marine GOOP that I picked up at CTC.
545893,cityfisher,2011-01-31 16:24:00,959, do you tow yours accross the ice with a sled/ quad? tub takes a beating when going at 50 km/hr
545898,Rattletrap2,2011-01-31 16:31:00,1652,"If your sled is made with HDPE (High Density Polyethylene), then nothing will stick to it except itself. It will be embossed somewhere on the plastic, likely near the manufacturing info.  Just cut up a 5 gallon bucket (preferably black) into strips and use a heat gun from Crappy Tire to melt it in. Practice on the remains of the bucket first. I have repaired plastic floatation like this many times.  Good luck."
545910,2advanced,2011-01-31 16:49:00,53,Just get metal or plastic sheet and rivet that bad boy
545911,Terry,2011-01-31 16:52:00,14456,on the weekend I dented in 2 spots on the front of my portable hut I am afraid to knock them back out for fear it will crack nasty hitting a ice wall going 40 miles an hour
545927,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-31 17:16:00,10439,  Grab a heat gun and you should be able to work them out Terry.
545934,Mike01,2011-01-31 17:33:00,378,My clam got beat up pretty bad a couple of years ago.  I fiberglasses a good portion of the bottom and its still holding up.
545935,cityfisher,2011-01-31 17:39:00,959,I fiberglass coated the bottem of the clam with resin and it held up for 2 days then ripped off   
545938,Rattletrap2,2011-01-31 17:49:00,1652,"Fiberglass resin is probably better than many epoxies, but as I said, it is only a matter of time before it cracks off. That is one of the peculiarities of HDPE. It really only bonds with itself."
545939,mercman,2011-01-31 17:51:00,7054,"oops, misread the title......thought it said plastic wedding"
545942,GBW,2011-01-31 17:54:00,8460,Please let me know how you make out as my clam 2000 has a crack as well.
545957,cityfisher,2011-01-31 18:24:00,959,little road running and bouncing around muskoka 2 weekends back and it came right off. Hopefully JB weld does the trick
545958,Headhunter,2011-01-31 18:36:00,5703,Duct Tape! HH
545968,cityfisher,2011-01-31 18:51:00,959,doesnt hold either... tried that on sunday
545978,blue pickeral,2011-01-31 19:07:00,267, Not quite - this stuff does: Mr. Sticky Poly-Bonder  http://a-a-i.net/polybonderuses.htm
545984,fishindude,2011-01-31 19:14:00,220,"I'll echo what Rattletrap has already said, polyethylene will only bond to itself.  I believe this MAY work http://www.mec.ca/Products/product_detail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524442631453&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302882912 Skiers and snowboarders use it to repair cracks and gouges on the base, it's also fairly easy to use; just light up and drip it into the cleaned work area.  Should be readily available at any reputable ski/snowboard shop.  Hope this helps, Cheers"
