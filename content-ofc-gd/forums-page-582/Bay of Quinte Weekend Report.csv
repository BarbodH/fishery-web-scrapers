We fished mostly in 18- 25 fow. The lures that were catching fish were gold buck shots and Jiggin Raps. Most of the fish we caught were in the 2 to 5lb range. We managed one 8 pounder, one 9 pounder and my pb walleye at 11lb 4oz. We had a great time and a lot of laughs. Be safe out on the ice there is a lot of white ice out there. I will post pics soon."

The fourth picture makes me think about this  http://www.sootoday.com/content/news/full_story.asp?StoryNumber=50506  There is a thread about consuming substances out on the ice.  Just a reminder to play safe.  David  aka  Superdad
