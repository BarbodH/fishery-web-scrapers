545519,vinnimon,2011-01-30 22:28:00,2593,"I woke this morning with a few pains(sciatica), dying to get out for some fishing. I shouldnt of went at all. I was planning to hit the niagara, but with the way I felt I decided to stay close, pack lite and a very short walk to the trout grounds.  Within a 1/2 hr of fishing with all the bait fish lurking around, I had 2 lake trout sniff my lures and swam away  After a 1/2 hr or so of nothing to be seen, trout wise I moved on.  Within 20 minutes, I had an interested brown hunt down my lure, so interested he actually took it , a ten minute fight, he was landed  Shortly after I had a bow stare at my lures a few times, only to swim away on me It was very fustrating.As were my other 3 trips down there.  With all the bait fish present, im surprised he hit the lure. Glad he did though.  I guess this guy cant be entered for the 2011 tourney, oh well! He will enter my belly soon enough.  All I can say now is, Im glad I went, but Im paying for it now and probably in the am. OUCH!!!!!  A pic of the bait fish viewed threw my aquaview."
