545406,Leecher,2011-01-30 14:12:00,7832,"Smart little guy Jack sure is growing up fast  Soon he'll say to you ""Can you say.... Let's Go Fishing Dad"""
545472,bigugli,2011-01-30 20:15:00,6138,"Wait til he learns to say, ""skip school, go fishing, Dad"".  Best phrase I ever taught the kids. He's cute, and he's sharp. Love it."
545674,Beans,2011-01-31 02:31:00,3339,"Most new mothers would not let me teach my grandkids like that...  I think the best was young J.C. who went to nursery schools and repeated:  Tea, tea...makes you pee,  Down your leg and over your knee...  The teacher said ""Who taught you that ?""  ""My Dad'' ... Poor Chris got blamed. not me...  JC's brother Daniel thought it was great that he was allowed to say ""We went fishing at the dam at Hastings"""
