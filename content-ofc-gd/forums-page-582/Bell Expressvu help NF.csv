545408,chris.brock,2011-01-30 14:19:00,4053,"I had my receiver disconnected for awhile, when I fired it back up, the picture color is odd and has a green hue. A DVD looks normal so I believe it's the satellite and not the TV, I tried all the functions on the remote, I tried resetting the receiver and did an online search but no luck. Anyone have any ideas?"
545409,2advanced,2011-01-30 14:25:00,53,Are you using component cables or Hdmi?
545411,Gerritt,2011-01-30 14:32:00,6129,my guess is he has component cables and the green and blue cables are reversed.
545412,2advanced,2011-01-30 14:35:00,53,Yup same here lol check your colours!
545413,rylan,2011-01-30 14:38:00,134,this happened to me a few days ago--  try this:  turn TV and receiver ON.  now Un-PLug the receive and plug back in.  This should re-boot the receiver.  Worked for me.
545414,rylan,2011-01-30 14:38:00,134,sorry-- keep it un-pluged for a minute
545415,chris.brock,2011-01-30 14:40:00,4053,"thanks guys, I feel kinda dumb, the cables were in the right holes but I think one wasn't all the way in, looks good now, thanks again"
545416,Gerritt,2011-01-30 14:41:00,6129,"No need for that monsterman, the proper way to reset a BEV receiver is to pull the card, and reinsert. It does a hard reset on the unit, as opposed to a soft reset like you are suggesting.  just a suggestion.   G"
545419,rylan,2011-01-30 14:53:00,134,thanxs Gerritt-- i will do that -- if it happens again.
545734,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-31 05:35:00,4399,"Sometimes if you have your cables laying on top of each other that can happen, okay enough for me I just finished a 13 hour work day on a sunday yet no lunch no supper, I need to join the union!!!  The things I do for my customers!!!"
546062,ohhenrygsr,2011-01-31 21:48:00,947,if your TV does HDMI giver.  same picture just cleans up the wires a lot more
