I was amazed at how many people were there! It was packed!!! Saw some great boats both fishing and cruising, and picked up some good info on my area waterways.The majority of the displays were for pleasure craft operators, with little fishing related merchants and reps.I guess i have to wait till Feb 27 for the husnting and fishing show. Here are a few pics for you look at. The first 3 are of the Starfish DLX SC by PrinceCraft, i just bought. Only dif is the color, mine is red.      Love to fish from this baby.Maybe when i retire.....   "
