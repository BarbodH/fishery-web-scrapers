I know I am not the only one, as I have seen many great little ideas that other OFNers have come up with that have helped me as well. It seems that for every problem, there is a solution. Ice fishing seems to be full of problems and bring out the innovators in all of us.  I have found unique ways to pack everything on my ATV (including my auger and minnow bucket) and  unique hitch system to make the time required to pack up and move minimal. The latest “problem” was eating a cold (and sometimes frozen) sandwich for lunch. Well I realized that my Mr buddy heater made a great sandwich warmer. With a little thinking and a couple of coat hangers, I came up with this:    It would be nice to see what others have done to solve some other challenges. Thanks for reading. Be safe out there. Cheers!"
