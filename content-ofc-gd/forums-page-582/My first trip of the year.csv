It is the first time I have managed to get out this year.  It was a BEAUTIFUL day, for the first couple hours I had my snow suit off and swear I got a tan.    Today was also the first time I got to take the 4 wheeler out on the ice, She went through everything just fine    Not long after I got all set up my first fish of 2011 came up, what a monster lol    I had steady action for a bit but nothing big    After a bit I got sick of the noise of everyone and went off to find a quiet part of the bay, I had a good feeling I would get nothing there but was it ever peaceful!    I set up my trusty rod holder and almost fell asleep        On my way back in I was stopped by the OPP who were out and about.  Hoping I can get out again next weekend."
