Here is his laneway to the house, his house and stage in the background. Crazy stuff me son!!    The rock wall you see in this pic, saved the house. Its amazing how many people came out to help, on christmas eve. That rock wall went up in a couple hours.    Here's the aftermath of the storm. Merry Christmas, eh? Not a wharf or stage left in the harbour!!    Now I'm homesick!!!  S."
544902,misfish,2011-01-29 00:56:00,29133,"Some serious damage there Shane. Thanks for the pics.  I got 2 uncles left on the Bell,the rest are in St.Johns or in WAWA..

544984,pidge,2011-01-29 03:53:00,438,"very nice thanks for sharin. My folks are from down there (Mom, Carbonear/Dad St.Georges) I myself havent been there since I was probley 10 as well. Awsome place and would love to revisit, but I'd probley burn my return ticket  I remember catching little cod (Tom cod??), trout in the rivers, some kind of flat fish off the bottom, and I remember some local kid catching a eel that had a pitbull looking head on it. Thats how I remember it anyways, it was damm vichous looking. Whales right outside my grandmas window. Also went to elementry school there for a year and boy what a difference."
545072,Sinker,2011-01-29 15:25:00,8692,"That eel with the pitbull face was probably what we call a sea cat. I'm not sure what the real name of them are, but I used to catch them off the wharf too. Big nasty teeth on them too!! Kinda like a cross between a musky and an eel.  S."
545090,crappieperchhunter,2011-01-29 16:25:00,2582,  I'm happy to hear your taking the rug rats down home this summer Shayne...I know it's been on the to do list for quite some time. Take lots of pictures and be sure to share them on here...Misfish isn't the only one who appreciates seeing them.
