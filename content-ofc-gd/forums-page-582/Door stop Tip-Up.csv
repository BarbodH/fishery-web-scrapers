545123,Muskieman,2011-01-29 18:11:00,2472,"I made another door stop tip up .. using a door stop spring... it's nothing new.. everyone has one..  I put a real reel on mine and kinda made a deluxe version..  But they are DEAD lines ... barely move with the strongest wind..  I tried something .. well It works.  I heated up a CD with a lighter and bent it with some pliers and wedged it into the spring.      <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvid183.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fx268%2Fsuran_photos%2FPicture.mp4"">  Randy "

I rotated it from side to side of my hole to ""Catch Wind"" it still didn't work...  every now and then a ""Flip-A-Shack"" gust would come along and knock the whole thing over.. never mind ""Auto Jiggin'""  It looked good in my ""Man Cave"" and seemed to work on my deck, but when the lure is submerged with a minnow things are totally different.  Back to the drawing board...  next is a Large Tupperware lid...  PS*  don't tell my wife I'm cutting up her Tupperware.  Randy "
