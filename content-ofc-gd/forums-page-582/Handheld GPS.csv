544194,Cosmos,2011-01-27 13:46:00,588,how do you like it? I was planning to get one.
544205,motion,2011-01-27 14:14:00,403,"Geoff, have used a Garmin GP72 for years for exactly what you want to do. I have also just purchased a used Lowrance H2O so I can use my hotmaps from my boat GPS. I have found the Garmin works well, however, I wanted to see the lake depths for new and better ice fishing grounds.  I paid $75.00 for the H2O on Kijiji."
544206,GBW,2011-01-27 14:14:00,8460,have you used it yet?  Do you like it?  Is it easy to use?  I just might have to order one too...
544346,skeeter,2011-01-27 19:26:00,1907,"i have the H2Oc i love it. very simple to operate. only problem is , i heard they dont make them any more. if you can find one used, grab it!!!!!!!!!"
544347,GBW,2011-01-27 19:37:00,8460,I ordered the garmin etrac venture hc combo kit from Radioworld today.  thanks all!
544375,motion,2011-01-27 20:49:00,403,"Dan, I find my H2O doesn't like the cold though. I have to keep mine in th e hut if I want to use it when it get really cold."
544398,skeeter,2011-01-27 21:45:00,1907,thats a great deal geoff. spare batteries in shirt pocket!!!!! always!!!!!!!  motion: i have never had a problem with mine. i mount it on my skidoo and it works good.
544404,pacman77,2011-01-27 22:28:00,2," the cheap ones work fine,mine is a cheapy and had it for a while now and best purchase ever for boating especially for getting back to great fishing holes or reefs hopefully you will not need it to find your way home in a storm an ERB likely a good purchase as well."
544407,archer379,2011-01-27 22:36:00,277,  it showed up on tues i work nights and havent had a hole lot of time to play i did have it with we at work and had the tracking turned on it showed me walking to tim hortons at break. \i think i will like it for the price you cant beat it. If your ordering from radio world watch wich one you order there is 2 differnt units one is cheaper
544565,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-28 03:55:00,0, let us know what you think of it!
544600,spincast,2011-01-28 10:42:00,3279,"if you plan on taking it out on softwater, my advice is get one that floats -- tie-ing the boat up on one of the last outings last year ""splash what was .... o fudge"".right out of my jacket pocket as I was leaning over the dock in low water levels......--"
544630,GBW,2011-01-28 13:59:00,8460,I got this one; http://radioworld.ca/product_info.php?products_id=6613  I will post what I think about it when I get a chance to test it.
544659,BillM,2011-01-28 15:35:00,17367,"Garmin GPSMap 62 here, nice upgrade over the 60csx it replaced."
545461,GBW,2011-01-30 19:09:00,8460,So now that I have this GPS and installed the software on the pc.  how do I get more detailed maps?  like a topo map of Ont?  Thanks in advance.
545465,archer379,2011-01-30 19:43:00,277,if you want it for waterways there is a disk you buy that covers in land lakes of ontatio or any other prov. it works the same as the disk you got with the gps
545469,douG,2011-01-30 19:59:00,2693,"Garmin 76CSX, had it for four years.  This thing will tell me what side of the street I am on.  The topo Canada map has incredible detail, even portages between tiny lakes north of Superior.  It has huge memory capability, is waterproof, and it floats.  Be wary of using a GPS that doesn't store a map.  An old buddy was hunting, and stored the location of his truck, but failed to load the map for the area.  As a result, he was stuck trying to find a good way around a big (unknown) swamp in late October with the sun going down - he didn't know where he was, only where his truck was.  He got very wet, and cold, and likely would not have made his way out that night, or at all.  FRS radio, lots of ammo for signalling, and buddies looking for him saved his hairy pimply that day.  The price being quoted for a gps like this one is a great deal, I paid almost double that, still worth every penny."
543816,GBW,2011-01-26 17:25:00,8460,"Hey all.  I'm considering getting a basic handhelp GPS with mapping capability.  I'm ok with used if the price is right.  All I want it for is to mark where I park when I go ice fishing so I can find my way back if a storm picks up.  That and to mark a good spot if I find one... I don't want to spend a lot either, I'm cheep...      Thanks.  Geoff"
543818,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-26 17:30:00,0,"if you can get a used one in the garmin 76 series, you'll be set.  i've used the 76, now i own the 76csx."
543819,Terry,2011-01-26 17:31:00,14456,I think this is one of the best out there and the price is great  Garmin GPSMAP 76CSx    In stock   010-00469-00   $259.95       http://www.gpscentral.ca/products/garmin/76csx.htm  and as for maps you can find them for free on the internet for that unit
543821,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-26 17:37:00,0,great minds think alike terry.
543823,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-26 17:39:00,2690,"Garmin GPSMAP 76CSx  In stock 010-00469-00 $259.95  Ah, man...why'd you have to show me that, Terry!!!  How, can I sneak that purchase by the ""little lady""..."
543824,uglyfish,2011-01-26 17:39:00,981,Di have a lowrance h2o and its been great. Got it for 100 bucks. And I think new they're less then 200. Or for a bit more u can get the color model.
543832,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-26 17:53:00,2690,"Hey, Geoff, maybe we can get a quantity discount on that Garmin that Terry and Doc mentioned, lol!!!!? I'm trying to be cheap too, but, that is a great unit for under $275!"
543833,Fang,2011-01-26 17:57:00,1330,If you want check out the post I made for an older Garmin 12. Exactly what I used that one for - no mapping though just WP and tracking/trail function   Hopefully we can hook up on the other stuff before ice fishing ends. Your Dec/Jan sounded a lot like mine.  Paul
543834,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-26 17:58:00,10439,"If all you want it for is finding your way back you don't need a mapping GPS. You can pick up just about any GPS used for lots less $$$. Check ebay.  I have 2 oldert non mapping GPS units that do the trick for general navigation.  Oh, and I have one of those Garmin GPS Map 76 dealies too. The B&W version though."
543836,Lunkerhunter,2011-01-26 18:00:00,455,i use the garmin oregon 200 and i absolutely love it. a friend has the 400 and its even better.  the oregon has full mapping capabilities as well as depth charts available.
543842,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-26 18:17:00,0,"if you're going to use a non-mapping gps, you might as well use a proper suunto, a map, and a pacing factor.  it's will likely be more accurate."
543848,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-26 18:29:00,10439," How do you figure? They both mark a waypoint and can take you to that waypoint. The mapping one just shows you a topo map of the area as opposed to a plain field with a waypoint on it.  I have been using a non mapping GPS in my boat since 1995 and have no problem getting back on the spot. Don't get me wrong I like my mapping handheld and want to replace my boat's GPS, but all the OP want's it for is to get back to his vehicle in white out conditions and a plain old basic GPS will do that and won't cost him $300. He does say he wants a mapping GPS, but for what he wants to do with it, it's not needed."
543850,GBW,2011-01-26 18:33:00,8460,"thanks guys, keep em coming. I found a Garmin eTrex H GPS for $50.  Will it do what I want and is it any good?"
543853,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-26 18:46:00,10439,  They work fine they just don't have mapping. But as I said you don't need mapping for what you said you want it for.
543855,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-26 18:51:00,0," I'll rephrase. If you're just getting into the world of GPS, don't start by using an antiquated technology.  And by and large a compass is actually more accurate and much faster than even a mapping gps when it comes to following a route through the bush."
543857,peterc,2011-01-26 18:59:00,28,  Is it my GPS?  Peter
543860,Roy,2011-01-26 19:04:00,13728,Whether you're using a mapping or non mapping GPS you should have a good compass with you at all times.
543862,GBW,2011-01-26 19:05:00,8460,
543867,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-26 19:13:00,0,"another consideration is that no gps before 2005 is WAAS enabled.  if you want your gps to work in a whiteout, i would advise being WAAS enabled.  unless you want to buy an external antenna."
543868,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-26 19:14:00,0,"  absolutely!  at any elevated security level, homeland security can scramble the US satellites, not to mention mechanical failure."
543891,canadadude,2011-01-26 19:54:00,769,"I'm not sure this is true, I timber cruised in the 80's with a silva, map, arieal photo's and a chain rope. It was pretty accurate, but leaves lots of room for human error, a gps will give you your exact location, the route you've traveled, your destination and where your start pt was.I'll tell you if I was still working the bush I wouldn't leave the truck without a GPS.Your right  relying completly on your GPS could be a mistake, and one should always have a compass with them when traveliing through the bush, but as far a accuracy it's pretty tough to beat todays technology"
543901,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-26 20:13:00,0, a non-waas GPS can be up to 100 metres off the mark. we both know you are far more accurate than that.
543922,peterc,2011-01-26 20:38:00,28,"  I have one for sale on other boards.Identical,same price,just curious."
543926,GBW,2011-01-26 20:42:00,8460,I know you do...
543930,archer379,2011-01-26 21:11:00,277,"i just bought a etrac venture hc radioworld has them on sale for a 100.00 comes with case, dash mount, and car adaptor."
