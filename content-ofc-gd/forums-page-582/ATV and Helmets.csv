Do they need helmets also? Just want to make sure I don't break any rules on the ice. Can you double ride on the atv?  Thanks Matt"
545740,Terry,2011-01-31 10:06:00,14456,as long as you have a towbar and they have helmets you're good to go if the sled has a roof on it then they don't need helmets
545752,Big Cliff,2011-01-31 12:03:00,6899, Not legally even if it is a two up machine. That may be changing but hadn't as of last summer.
545761,skeeter,2011-01-31 13:03:00,1907,"Terry and Big Cliff are both right. but if the atv is manufactured with a 2 up seat it is legal. if you add a second seat onto it , then it is not legal. like terry said TOWBAR not a rope. a rigid tow bar can be made from a hockey stick or just about anything."
545786,Woodsman,2011-01-31 13:44:00,1286,"Terry,Big Cliff & skeeter are both right & wrong. If the ATV is being operated under the HTA than two on an ATV is not legal, nor is it legal to have anyone in the sleigh. If the ATV is being operated under the ORVA than two on the ATV (any ATV) is legal. In the sleigh is also legal. Under the ORVA there is also no requirement for a solid tow bar.Excellent idea though. The requirement for a solid tow bar is in the MSVA.(snowmobiles) Helmets are required at all times. Here are the ORVA & MSVA Acts. http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90o04_e.htm http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90m44_e.htm Notice helmets & insurance required under both acts. Only the MSVA mentions a rigid tow bar. While on public roads the HTA generally applies."
