Hi guys, just wanted to tell you that today I received the most beautiful indoor miniature garden, with ferns and ivy, and cactus, with a little bird inside,thats what it looks like to me, it is absolutely amazing, it is from the Ontario Fishing Network, oh how nice of them to do this for me, so I am asking you Cliff if you could possibly reply to the network for me, as I have no clue how to do it, and I must thank whoever did it and let them know how much it brightened up my day.  Also to thank everyone for their support and emails during the past month, such caring people, even those that never met my Jack, sent their condolences to me, I will never forget it.  I am getting there slowly, I have my ups and down days, but today is a good day thanks to very thoughtful people.  Thanks for your help say hi to Sue take care my friends, Love Jackie and Teddyxxx  "
