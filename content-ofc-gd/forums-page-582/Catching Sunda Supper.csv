545485,Fisherman,2011-01-30 20:57:00,7201,"Got out this morning to  try out the new ATV and hut today, nice little machine, comfortable for sure.  Fired up the Buddy heater and it was coat off in short order.  Caught enough perch(not to be a glutton) to make sunday supper for two.  "
545486,Leecher,2011-01-30 21:03:00,7832,Great toys you have there Fisherman Sounds like it was nice and cozy in your hut once you got the heat on Enjoy the fish fry   and thanks for sharing!!! Leechman
545499,Grimace,2011-01-30 21:30:00,2020,Look at the shine coming off of that Grizzly.  Nice set up you have there.
545505,misfish,2011-01-30 21:48:00,29133,Well were having a fish feed aswell. Halibut and fresh cut fries. No It wasnt caught on Simcoe.  Thanks for the report Erich.  What the heck is that antique thing on the ice der?
545516,ckrb2007,2011-01-30 22:18:00,449,Nice looking set-up!! I keep telling my wife that the set-up helps catch more fish!!
545524,Fisherman,2011-01-30 22:36:00,7201," Well I'm pretty sure, other than me, the box is about 18 years old and the auger is 20."
545527,Fisherman,2011-01-30 22:41:00,7201," Well someone    (12footspringbok)  adopted my other portable, he was using it more than I was, ah what the heck, so I got a single Otter, a little easier for this old buzzard to load up into the truck.  My old ARGO is now living in a swamp somewhere around Parry Sound and making someone happy.  Ya only live once, may as well enjoy the toys while you're still above ground."
545532,Jds63,2011-01-30 22:49:00,1365,"wow nice setup, i've been looking at the Honda's , but the grizzly is a fine machine too"
545535,Fisherman,2011-01-30 22:53:00,7201," Honda is a quality product too, however, after a pile of research I found the mid size ones were still carburated, some had solid rear axles and the electronic shift transmission can give you the fits if it gets any moisture in it.  I've got other Honda products and never had any trouble with them.  We have a couple of Kodiaks at work the only shop time they see is for regular oil changes spring and fall.  Winter use is for plowing and summer for buzzing around our ranges."
545558,misfish,2011-01-30 23:39:00,29133,  I wasnt expecting a gas jobber from you. Thought maybe you were a wooden handle corkscrew kinda a guy.LOL  Like the otter set up.Looks better then the Polar  express that I have.
545613,Fisherman,2011-01-31 01:01:00,7201,"Honestly, I had a hand cranker once upon a time and it worked quite well, then I got posted to Manitoba.  Upon arriving at the lake there the first time at the middle of December '91, I pulled out my trusty cranker and proceeded to crank...and crank until I reached the bend in the handle when a couple of locals began to chuckle and said, ""you're not from around here are ya""  No, just moved in, ice seems kinda thick.  3Feet+, then I bought the gasser with an extension and it just made it.  Never looked back at the hand cranker."
