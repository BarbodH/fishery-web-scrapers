635941,davey buoy,2011-10-30 20:23:00,5505,"I've been fogging my motors for years,do you think it really works? and will it do any internal damage?Thanks davey."
635951,Roy,2011-10-30 21:06:00,13728,Probably. It'd depend on the flogging I suppose. A gentle flogging would serve as a lesson.
635952,craigdritchie,2011-10-30 21:10:00,1586,It depends. How well do you want it to behave?
635953,John,2011-10-30 21:12:00,2956,"I flog my wife and children on a regular basis, whether they need it or not.."
635972,aplumma,2011-10-30 22:26:00,6896,Aww he changed the spelling no more fun...  Fogging has a big benefit it puts a protective coating on the passages were the Air flows thru the engine. With a fuel additive protecting the fuel and good old anti freeze in the water jacket you are golden.   Art
636023,chris.brock,2011-10-31 01:25:00,4053,"I don't know, but me and 3 other guys have stand-up jetskis at the cottage and we all just throw them under a tree, under a tarp, and fire them up the next year (or sometimes 2 years later) and they don't miss a beat, just my 2 cents"
636259,aplumma,2011-10-31 19:58:00,6896," The jetskies carbs are built without float bowls so they are less likely to build varnish than the floatbowled carbs found on outboard motors. The fuel in the tank will still burn but it has water, varnish and other unburnable products. Jetskies will take a beating without question but  any motor that you take care of will last longer than one that you take less care of.   Art"
636294,Bob,2011-10-31 21:08:00,370,How many of us remember when there was no such thing. Most of us just ran the gas out of the engine on the last trip in the fall and drained the lower unit. Fill the lower unit in the spring and top up the gas tank and you're good to go. Outboards lasted almost forever and nobody worried too much.  What happened?  Someone came up with all this unneeded high tech stuff and all of a sudden it costs a fortune to winterize an outboard.  What's up with that?
636306,lookinforwalleye,2011-10-31 21:57:00,4399," It`s called creating additional streams of income!!!  I remember some years ago when I had my Evinrude I went to the dealer with a list of stuff that the manual said I needed to winterize, the mechanic promptly scratched 2/3 of the stuff off the list."
636310,davey buoy,2011-10-31 22:03:00,5505,"Forgot to mention my motor is a 305 V8,and thank god I did that because I noticed a gas leak on the hose to the carb.Can never be to carefull with i/o boats:worthy:.Probably would of found it in the spring,but just saying."
636312,lookinforwalleye,2011-10-31 22:06:00,4399,Yep blow`d up real good!!!
636313,davey buoy,2011-10-31 22:16:00,5505,Thanks guys for some of your helpful replies. Never quite understood why there isn't a interlock on the key start to make sure there is no chance of starting the boat without the blower running for at least 20 sec. like that gas leak could happen at anytime. I also believe that the less rust you have on your cylinders and rings can't be a bad thing either when you fire up in the spring.
636340,John,2011-10-31 23:37:00,2956," Sorry davey, didn't mean to have a laugh at your expense............well, ok I did, but nothing personal, apologies....J..."
636345,davey buoy,2011-10-31 23:41:00,5505, No worries John
636430,Tybo,2011-11-01 02:05:00,1373," Theirs a old saying.A stitch in time saves nine.  In the mechanical trade,This is called Preventative Maintenance.  And yes,keep fogging.It's only going too help."
636442,dannyboy,2011-11-01 02:57:00,367,Yep keep on fogging - preventative maintenance goes a long way. Don't turn the engine over after you fog and then pull the plugs and crank the engine in the spring to give the cylinders a chance to clear before you first start it. You can always find someone to tell you otherwise but I have seen the inside of enough engines to know it makes a difference.  Dan
636487,Jer,2011-11-01 11:26:00,1426,  You wouldn't seriously leave the lower unit empty (with no oil) all winter would you?
636616,davey buoy,2011-11-01 19:05:00,5505,"Jer,I take the top plug out for the winter,and in the spring I top up and look for water.I have maybe 30hrs a year.Used for fishing at this point.Thanks guys!"
636620,Roy,2011-11-01 19:11:00,13728,"Davey, seriously, you should be looking for the correct method of doing this. You're leaving the upper plug open during the winter? You're supposed to be filling it from the bottom. There must be something I'm not understanding here."
636623,davey buoy,2011-11-01 19:28:00,5505,"Roy,it's a expansion thing,I believe there is no water in the lower unit ,but if there was, there was room for expansion of ice.I always fill from the bottom to change or top up the oil. Your thinking maybe drain the oil and all new oil in the spring? davey. Remember the lower end is completely covered in garbage bags and sealed. No chance of rain getting in roy. Let me know what ypu think?"
636624,lew,2011-11-01 19:34:00,12766,"Your best to refill the lower unit in the fall Davey, that way if there is any water in there it'll be removed and then no worries about freezing."
636625,davey buoy,2011-11-01 19:39:00,5505,Lew I think I might just do that . Thanks davey
636643,lookinforwalleye,2011-11-01 20:38:00,4399,Bingo!!!
636975,esoxansteel,2011-11-03 01:46:00,1307,"I love to fog my motor, it gives me great satisfaction to know come spring when its warm and sunny, and the neighbours have their windows open, its time to break out the ear muffs and fill there houses full of smoke."
