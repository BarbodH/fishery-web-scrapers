636441,NAW,2011-11-01 02:50:00,4022, Wow.  I thought shooting through 2' was good.  That's crazy.!
636446,adolson,2011-11-01 03:25:00,783,  I'm gonna try anyhow.
636670,Sharkbait22,2011-11-01 22:58:00,297,"I wouldn’t leave home without a GPS, sonar, and a phone. Always carry a GPS to get to previous spots that produced and for safety.  Truthfully, many of the spots in my GPS e.g. for Simcoe, have been one-hit wonders.  Still I sled to these spots annually and even from day to day.  But just because a spot was good on Wednesday doesn’t seem to mean it will be good on Thursday.  Simcoe seems to lack obvious spots that might hold fish.  Nipissing is similar.  I mean that spots that really produced weren’t near anything obvious – just a big flat area.  Anyone find this to be true? I find it frustrating at times."
636671,Billy Bob,2011-11-01 23:08:00,5865, I have some big flat areas in Lake Erie that have been producing very well for the last 3-4 years with Yellow Perch....that population is very high right now......I treasure a few of those GPS numbers right now...if and when the perch population falls so will my success at those hot spots.  Bob
636674,Roy,2011-11-01 23:17:00,13728," In all fairness to the big flat areas, they're spots too y'know."
636681,BillM,2011-11-01 23:56:00,17367,"Slight elevation changes in Simcoe can pay off like crazy...  Usually the fish come up on the mud flats to feed, then slowly retreat back to the deeper haunts.  And like I said before, you gotta run and gun out there."
636682,misfish,2011-11-02 00:16:00,29133,"I have followed these guys that said ,follow me.I HAVE POINTS. Ya ok. I,ll stick with what I know,where I know.Dont get me wrong,GPS units have come along way."
636685,Terry,2011-11-02 00:17:00,14456,follow me with the snow&ice walker.....
636688,misfish,2011-11-02 00:21:00,29133, Right on.
636689,Cookslav,2011-11-02 00:23:00,1457,"yup...I do I've marked a few spots of underwater structure that held fish in the Soft water season, but in truth its success has been minimal.  It would seem the summer haunts don't always produce the same way in the cold. But I'd have to say that each time out to these spots we've not been skunked...so its put me on fish, but I've not seen any banner days?"
636756,Dabluz,2011-11-02 04:24:00,701," For the best bang for your buck, the Garmin Legend that costs about 150 dollars is your best buy.  It is sometimes on sale for 100 dollars.  Yes....you will have to buy map software to increase the amount of detail but it is well worth the price to buy the mapware.  You have to buy the same maps no matter which GPS you buy.  There are tons of places on the internet to get free bathymetric maps to add to your maps.  If you know where to look you can even get free maps and not buy the mapware.  You can then download a free program like ""Easy GPS"" to store info in your home computer or laptop (dates, waypoints, notes etc etc)."
636757,Dozer,2011-11-02 04:41:00,896, Fantastic advice
636145,Roy,2011-10-31 14:32:00,13728,I'm curious to know how many of you use your GPS during the soft water season to mark way points that are likely to hold fish during the hard water season. The GPS is an ideal tool for that but I wonder how many think to mark them and write notes to help you while out on the ice.
636150,BillM,2011-10-31 14:37:00,17367,"My portable GPS has all my secret whitie hotspots    Really helps for fishing when it's a blizzard out as well, lol  I never go out on the ice without it."
636151,Billy Bob,2011-10-31 14:37:00,5865,"Don't know what kind of GPS/Sonar unit you have but my Lowrance LMS 520C unit records the date, time and water depth when I enter  that waypoint in....I can also (and do many times) change the waypoint number to a name and enter a icon for that spot...my perch spots have a several small fish icon while my walleye spot icon is a much larger single fish.  I wouldn't go on Eire without my GPS unit.  Hope this helps, Bob"
636155,mike rousseau,2011-10-31 14:51:00,4661,i did this before i had navionics on my iphone...  i marked a patch of rocks in the summer... set up my friends ice shack on it during hardwater...  we were the only ones (that i knew of) that were consistantly catching eyes...  now with navionics on my iphone... i dont have to mess around as much... no need to drill 10 holes before you hit the right depth... i just walk out till i hit the right contour line and sit down...
636167,Harrison,2011-10-31 15:26:00,2202," Roy, I've been more inclined to do the opposite.  Usually when I am on fish near ice out I can hit those same waypoints when the lakes opensup and still get them. An example of this is Whities on Simcoe.  As Bill M said. I never hit the ice with out a GPS, even if just for safety reasons.  I've been turned around once in a freak blizzard, that scared me enough for this lifetime."
636175,fishnsled,2011-10-31 15:53:00,3520," Never on the ice without my GPS but don't forget a good old compass. Batteries/electronics can fail.  As for marking spots, do it all year long for return visits anytime of the year."
636180,Terry,2011-10-31 16:09:00,14456,yeah much easier marking new spots in the summer  you don't have to drill a new hole to find the spot on a spot
636184,BillM,2011-10-31 16:15:00,17367,  Drill a hole maybe 6inches down and fill with water.  Put your transducer in it and it will go right through the ice   Quick and dirty way to see the bottom without all the work.
636207,motion,2011-10-31 16:57:00,403,"Roy, though I use a GPS in both hard and soft water fishing,I fish for for different species though out the year. Making spots gives us options during the hard water season when weather and ice conditions change."
636273,Harrison,2011-10-31 20:34:00,2202," Compass eh, I have an app for that!"
636276,adolson,2011-10-31 20:42:00,783,"I should get a GPS.. Actually, I do have a really old eTrek, but it is for trails mostly, and has no maps, just looks like an etch-a-sketch with a couple icons here and there. I guess I could make limited use of it, but with Christmas coming I'd be interested in inexpensive suggestions.."
636277,Terry,2011-10-31 20:42:00,14456, I just take a back up GPS with me oh wait both died when I was on temagami ..never mind
636298,tjsa,2011-10-31 21:32:00,1578," Yup, it works great. Got us on a couple of spots last winter that we could've spent an hour or more searching, drilling, test jigging to find. We have a new hump from last summer to try this winter."
636300,Rizzo,2011-10-31 21:38:00,4754,"Nope. Where I go the fish (perch) are so thick it doesn't matter if I'm 100 feet this way or that way. Drill a hole, catch like mad until I'm bored and the fingers are numb, go home."
636302,craigdritchie,2011-10-31 21:40:00,1586,My GPS does a wonderful job in the wintertime ...... by showing me the way south to where I can fish in open water.
636307,Remastered,2011-10-31 21:58:00,143, Scared of the ice?
636324,NAW,2011-10-31 22:38:00,4022,"I can't say I've even done that before..  I do have lots of spots marked on the GPS with notes on what part of the season they are best, and how many fish I've caught there.  But I've never marked a spot in the summer, with the intention of going back in the winter."
636368,Fisherman,2011-11-01 00:29:00,7201,They work and will get your butt back in the right direction in a whiteout.
636393,OutdoorDan,2011-11-01 00:58:00,325, Maps aren't really a necessity because you are mostly going to use it to return to waypoints you marked.  You should either use the one you have or get one and get in the habit of making a waypoint where you parked your car before you walk out.  It can save you if you are stuck in a blizzard or if for whatever reason you are out on the ice past sunset.
636410,craigdritchie,2011-11-01 01:24:00,1586,   Nope. But it's too much work making a hole big enough to fit the boat in.
636411,BillM,2011-11-01 01:27:00,17367,"Craig, let me know if you wanna get out for whities this year.  We can get around pretty quick on the sled and the Clam is great for windy days"
636412,dhickey,2011-11-01 01:27:00,1038,I have never used GPS for fishing or land travel. It would seem to me that marking fish in open water would not relate to winter conditions. ie.water temp/light levels/weather conditions/weed lines/noise. To say that GPS is not usefull would be stupid on my part. I just feel that fish move and act different in winter conditions as oposed to other seasons . Larger lakes such as Simcoe probably wouldnt be affected as much as a small lake by ice conditions or weather during winter months.  So I do plan on getting a GPS unit for this winter but its mainly based on safety more so than nailing fish.  I like the thrill of a blind hunt. Shure its more work but what a RUSH  GOOD LUCK AND PLAY SAFE ON THE ICE
636413,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-01 01:28:00,10439,"  Don't bother drilling. Clear the snow, put 'ducer on the ice and a splash of water is all you need. You can't shoot through white ice though as there are too many air bubbles. I have been able to shoot through over 5' of clear ice and mark fish doing it."
636416,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-01 01:33:00,10439, Man up there buttercup!!!  
636439,camillj,2011-11-01 02:32:00,1988,Yep .. my Lowrance H2O comes out with me ... especially on new lakes or when trekking through the bush to a 'back lake' huntin for specks  Also comes in handy finding the 'route' in on those seasonal roads when some are not always well marked or plowed.
