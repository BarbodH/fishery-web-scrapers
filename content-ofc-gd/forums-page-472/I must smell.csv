636931,skinny,2011-11-02 23:23:00,442,ok so was nice day and I really had the itch to fish. The issue was I had a a job fair to go to in Brantford.So as I sat and looked at job posting sites and facebook I see Rich on and I bugg him about fishing. Then the light bulb goes off. Rich knows some spots in Brantford on the grand. So we talk I'm going to pick him up and go. So get ready and go. I pick up Rich and off to the hole. I fish for about an hour then off to Job fair. I hang out in line for 45 min till job fair opens at 1:00 get in fill out papers do small interview and out the door by 1:10. Back to the grand to find Rich still tossing stuff in the water for a good washing. I fish some more and wash up all my stuff till it's shinny. It was time to go (cause I had kids to pick up) so we had to call it a day SKUNKED. Here's the good news I got home with Kids and check Messages the place that had the fair had called and wants to set up a interview. I have to call in the morning as per message.
