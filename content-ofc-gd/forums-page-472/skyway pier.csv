634209,northernpike56,2011-10-26 00:42:00,717,"I've heard that there's carp, salmon, and trout hanging around the peir as well as sheepshead cruising the walls of the pier. Would there also be walleye, bass, pike, etc. present?"
634310,johnnyb,2011-10-26 13:18:00,3413,"I wouldn't expect too many guys to post openly about whether they're doing well or not off the pier....just too easy to get to, and who likes to share a spot when the fishing's good?  I would recommend heading down there and checking it out...if we don't hear from you, we'll know you're doing well   I wouldn't expect too much in the walleye department....mayyyyybe the odd bass or pike...."
