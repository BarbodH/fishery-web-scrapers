637287,Jds63,2011-11-04 02:58:00,1365,"thanks,   simple little mod, when i get a power auger will have to do that"
637289,GBW,2011-11-04 03:05:00,8460,"it's a good idea, cheers."
637292,skeeter,2011-11-04 03:13:00,1907,"Great idea. Those pins are cheap enough to keep a few on hand. When a lake gets fed anything that doesn't float, it doesn't give it up. Just ask all my reading glasses.LOL"

There are 2 diameter sizes out there. Get the one that fills the existing bolt hole. The smaller ones break because of the slop. My bud used a smaller one, it broke, and with the torque of the power head when it failed it pulled his shoulder and chest muscles pretty good. Have heard of 2 other people who hurt themselves by using the smaller size pin."
637325,Terry,2011-11-04 11:12:00,14456,Irishfield set me up with something like that some time ago.....  long video for 10 seconds of info..but if you didn't know about these pins it is good info
637359,ld17,2011-11-04 13:46:00,319,nice tip.  My jiffy comes standard with a quick release pin.  I guess it's the small things that make you decide to buy one unit over the next.
