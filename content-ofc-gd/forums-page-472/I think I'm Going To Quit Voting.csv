Canadians having a say in their own destiny  Article:  Going Against Party Line Costs Two MP's Posted by Mike Ebbeling on Thursday, November 3rd, 2011 am 11:13:31 AM  Thunder Bay area MP's Bruce Hyer and John Rafferty are paying for their decision to go against the NDP and vote to abolish the long gun registry. The NDP has stripped Hyer and Rafferty of their Critics positions and they can't ask questions or make statements in the House of Commons. Hyer calls the punishment draconian. Raffery says the NDP are punishing his constituents. Interm Leader Nicole Turmel made the decision."
637357,bigugli,2011-11-04 13:46:00,6138,Then it would only be reasonable for Hyer and Rafferty to sit as independents. It gives the NDP a black eye as these MPs choose to represent their constituents. They come off looking like heroes in their riding for taking a stand.
637371,Handlebarz,2011-11-04 14:19:00,3790,I will keep voting as CK has made the change and if it was not for each vote we would not have finally had our change. In the long run it made a big difference as it kept Ontario from another majority. Any way T-10-9-8
637384,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-04 14:55:00,0,Good on those folks for representing their constituents first.  My local NDP MP federally lost in this past election for towing NDP party lines and voting to maintain the LG registry.  He lost to a Conservative candidate which NEVER happens in Sault Ste. Marie and I feel this issue was the sole reason he lost.
