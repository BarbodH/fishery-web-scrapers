I have stayed with one operator for the past 4 years (South Shore) and they have been awesome, however I have always found the walleye fishing to be very hit and miss.  Just wondering if anyone has any other suggestions or great experiences.  It will be just him and I going and want to stay for 3 nights.  Thanks in advance."

Walleye catching can really be hit and miss there although the perch would make up for the slow time.  Make sure to bring some games along for him to play or a portable DVD player.  At 4 years old, they have their limits on attention span.  My youngest used to come with me, watch cartoons on a little B&W TV, catch fish and go build a snow fort.  He is still fishing today, if it wasn't for work, probably fish every day."

637013,Roy,2011-11-03 10:11:00,13728,I don't know if you've looked through our sister site.  I've stayed at Rob Hyatt's and had good service.
637364,gordy28,2011-11-04 13:53:00,638,We have used two operators: Idle Tyme and The Waltonian Inn Both were great hosts etc - and dont think you can go wrong with either We did however have much more luck fishing at Idle Tyme than we did at the Waltonian In fairness to the Waltonian we arrived at the height of a cold snap (-30 without the wind chill) so fishing seemed to be tough for everyone No pickeral  - lots of perch and the odd whitefish at Idle Tyme Cheers Gordy
