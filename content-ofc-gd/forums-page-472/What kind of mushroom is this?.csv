636759,adolson,2011-11-02 05:17:00,783,"I don't know what that is, but in my limited experience with mushrooms, if you eat it, you either double in size, or you get a free extra life. Either way, it's a win-win."
636768,Miracon,2011-11-02 11:25:00,200,LMAO at both Two and Dana's answers!  I can't help you either but one thing seems sure...it's happy to see you!
636787,GBW,2011-11-02 13:20:00,8460,LOL!!!  I'm shocked nobody has said 'it's a fungi' yet...
636788,Kawartha Kev,2011-11-02 13:22:00,281,It is some type of coral fungus probably from the genus Clavariadelphus. Its tough to judge the size from your photo but the species is probably either ligula or pistillaris. It has also been identified under the genus of Clavaria try a search for either of these names and maybe you will be able to find the one that is closest to the one in your photo.  Good luck!!

636804,Fisherman,2011-11-02 14:18:00,7201," The mushroom or fungi is about 2 inches high, 3/4 inch in diameter at the top.  I broke one off, it solid all the way through, no gills.  A quick check, looks most like the one in the linkMy link"
636817,Kawartha Kev,2011-11-02 14:50:00,281, I can't get your link to work for some reason Fisherman but it could definitely also be Clavariadelphus truncatus here's a link to some more pics  Mushroom Pics
636827,Fisherman,2011-11-02 15:10:00,7201,"Yes, thanks for the link that works, definitely the one on your picture, bottom right in the pine needles."
