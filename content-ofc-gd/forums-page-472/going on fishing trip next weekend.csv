636178,chuckymcd,2011-10-31 16:03:00,144,What kinda fish are you fishing for?

636925,notvincent,2011-11-02 23:09:00,25, Im mainly trying for pike and I've been using a lure called the blue fox.
636929,GBW,2011-11-02 23:17:00,8460,big lures at slow speeds this time of year then.
636978,notvincent,2011-11-03 02:00:00,25, any specific type of lure
636981,BillM,2011-11-03 02:02:00,17367,For pike?  A big Williams whitefish would be my choice.
637016,notvincent,2011-11-03 10:43:00,25,Thanks for everyone's help.
637028,NAW,2011-11-03 12:41:00,4022,Try a big flourecent coloured mepps cyclops.
637030,johnnyb,2011-11-03 12:49:00,3413,"Oliver, Blue Fox is a lure company....the lure you have is likely a spinner...called a [blue Fox] Vibrax.  Size 5 is a solid choice for pike, and hungry smallmouth won't turn it down either. As others have mentioned, large spoons are a great choice as well."
