636937,bigbuck,2011-11-02 23:31:00,2449,Congrats on the ski and even more so with the revive/release.
636943,mike rousseau,2011-11-02 23:42:00,4661,Nice work getting her to take eventually...  No measurement?
636967,esoxansteel,2011-11-03 01:26:00,1307,"fish was just over 48 without a tail pinch, and a 19 inch girth I was most intriqued that the fish was seen 2 days prior, and today been relatively slow fish wise, decided to return to that fish during a peak solurable time(moon rise) and she decided it was time 2 eat, and also after over a hour a successful release was achieved, i have caught a few that were larger, but that was one if not the most memorable one, the so called plan coming together.

636970,Nipfisher,2011-11-03 01:33:00,2449,Great release story. Better than the catch in my opinion. Congrats.
636971,mike rousseau,2011-11-03 01:34:00,4661,I had a big girl follow me on a spot one time...  2 days later my buddy caught what I think was the same fish( you never really know)
636973,captpierre,2011-11-03 01:44:00,2521,"made my day to hear that one, thanks"
637001,livinisfishin,2011-11-03 04:05:00,661,"Nice work on the revival! I've never caught one but sounds like they are pretty delicate! Even though it ""eventually"" revived I bet there is quite a few people out there that would have just continued fishing after a few minutes."
637007,lew,2011-11-03 07:32:00,12766,Congrats on the fish Steve and good job on taking the extra effort for the revival.
