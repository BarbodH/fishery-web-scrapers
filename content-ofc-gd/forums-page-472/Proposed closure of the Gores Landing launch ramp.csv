Apparently there are a few residents complaining about parking issues. There is a meeting being held at the Gores Landing Library on November 10 at 7:00PM.  Anyone who uses the launch ramp in Gores Landing would be in your best interest to attend.  The issues around the use of launching is mostly because of owners of vehicles illegally parking. Inconsiderate people once again are ruining a public space for all to use.  For further information on how you can help to keep the launch ramp open, contact Plank Road Cottages at:  [emailÂ protected]  Be sure to include launch ramp closure in the subject line."
