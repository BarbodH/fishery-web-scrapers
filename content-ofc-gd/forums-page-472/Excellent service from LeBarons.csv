637154,lew,2011-11-03 21:25:00,12766,I ordered a new PFD from LeBarons in Montreal on Monday afternoon and it arrived in the mail this morning.  Pretty good service in my books
637155,Joey,2011-11-03 21:27:00,9122,"Ya, they've gotten better over the last few years Lew"
637162,davey buoy,2011-11-03 21:33:00,5505,There pricing is by far the best I have found in the gta.
637167,misfish,2011-11-03 21:44:00,29133, Whats the difference from ordering from the one in Toronto Lew? Or is that their cataloge ordering home?
637179,lew,2011-11-03 21:51:00,12766,"Seems like all orders come from the Montreal store Brian.  And your right Davey, their prices are good, in fact one Mustang I looked at from CTC was $50 more than LeB's  BIG differences compared to a few years ago Joey.... for the better."
637195,mercman,2011-11-03 22:27:00,7054,"  Yup, since BPS and Sail opened, They have had to adapt, and change the way the service thier customers.I find the store staff are very helpful and thier prices some of the best around. How do you like the feel of the new vest Lew?"
637196,lookinforwalleye,2011-11-03 22:30:00,4399,perhaps he will try it out in the tub tonite!
637198,lew,2011-11-03 22:44:00,12766," I don't have the actually vest in my hands yet, just the notice telling me it's at the post office and I'll be picking it up in the morning.  I upgraded from my original choice and went with the Mustang MD3153"
637219,mercman,2011-11-03 23:33:00,7054,"  You wont refret it Lew. keep a regular vest in your boat if you can.That way, you can take the inflatable off if it gets ""Scratchy"""
637269,Rizzo,2011-11-04 01:45:00,4754,Prices have always been good. The issues I always had when I lived down that way was a couple of the guys in the Mississ store were pretty much morons. I once stood at the counter for 5 minutes while 2 guys made idle chitchat with each other...until I lost it on them. Do you know how long 5 minutes is when you're the only one at the counter and the staff are basically ignoring you? Felt like an hour my blood pressure was on the rise
637274,Moosebunk,2011-11-04 02:02:00,3970,"Used to mail order BIG orders every spring when the income tax return came in.  A treat to me.  They were always good and speedy.  Just faxed them through a list, a credit card number and the wife's tax exempt and POW!  Christmas in July."
637277,mike rousseau,2011-11-04 02:19:00,4661,I don't forget how I've been treated in the past...  Giving good customer service only because you have competition now is wrong...  Lebarons has always had bad service in the past...  I will never step foot in a lebarons again...
637285,otter649,2011-11-04 02:39:00,118,Haven't been to Lebarons for a few years - Do they still have  their discount card ?
637390,ricoboxing,2011-11-04 15:14:00,398,"if they have it in stock at BPS (which is rare), then you could just bring the lebarons catalog, and they will match the price. This way you could try it on and don't pay for shipping."
637405,GBW,2011-11-04 15:57:00,8460,yes they do.  I have had good and so-so service from the Markham location.  It's out of my way to shop there now but I always check the prices online against the other stores.
637406,Beans,2011-11-04 16:01:00,3339,I never had a problem with them when I lived in Richmond Hill and dealt with the store on Kennedy Rd. below Hwy 7...I got so that I knew where what I wanted was and only dealt with the Oriental clerk even if I had to wait for him to be free if I had any questions...  I was only in the Missisausage store once and a lady came up to me and asked about some ice fishing tackle...as I was explaining a small crowd started to gather and a clerk asked if I was a rep of the tackle on display...as sometimes the reps will act as clerks...NOPE !!!...
637410,lew,2011-11-04 16:13:00,12766," Couple years back I was looking to buy a new troll motor and checked both places. LeBarons was about $25 cheaper and when I asked BPS if they'd match it they told me ""nope, we don't do price matching"", so LeBarons got my business.  I've heard from others since then that BPS does indeed do price matching, so perhaps they should let ALL their staff know, specially the guys who are talking to customers on the phone."

637413,ricoboxing,2011-11-04 16:37:00,398,"I guess some of the reps don't know. When I did it I just brought the product to customer service instead of checkout with the flyer, and they did it right there. I was gonna buy it at lebarons, but it was out of stock...luckily BPS didnt check."
637415,captpierre,2011-11-04 16:41:00,2521,The Markham store has always treated me right.  I would hate to think how much I've spent there over the years.  Usually pay cash so the wifey doesn't find out
637422,dannyboy,2011-11-04 16:53:00,367,Good on LeBarons and good on Canada Post - thanks for the information.  Dan
637439,ketchenany,2011-11-04 18:13:00,3229,"That's just a fast as the MERCMAN, check the pockets there may be little screwdrivers."
