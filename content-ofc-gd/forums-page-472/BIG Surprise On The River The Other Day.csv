635518,solopaddler,2011-10-29 13:11:00,8605," It hit right at the end of the retrieve, about 5' in front of me.  A very subtle ""tick"" then just dead weight and big slow head shakes.  I figured it was a salmon on it's last legs. No furious runs, just a lengthy bulldog battle.  Wasn't until 10 minutes into the fight when I worked it in close and had a good look. At that point I pretty much had a heart attack LOL!    It's been a stellar month Cliff, lots of bright chrome steelhead.  Anytime you want to get out just say the word and we'll work something out."
635549,singingdog,2011-10-29 14:46:00,1047,"Something about this time of year, pike, and small lures. I had 3 pike the other day while smallie fishing with Nories tailspins. They are about the size of a #3 mepps. I finally switched lures because I couldn't keep the pike off of the tailspin.  Nice fish!!"
635557,spinnerdoc,2011-10-29 15:16:00,556,"Wow it is busy Mike...I hope my boy would be interested in steelheading. I'm hoping by the time he's 5 i'll be a little bit better at it  . I bet your son had a blast landing it.  a little off topic, do you happen to know where to get kids waders? My nephew could not forget when i took him one time but he didn't have any waders, he got in anyway and got wet and he got himself a nice little trout....needless to say he was so happy."
635660,corvette1,2011-10-29 22:33:00,1765,nice gator mike i will pm you after all the family stuff is over
635729,SirCranksalot,2011-10-30 01:20:00,3291,"Quite the fish, Solopaddler!! Have you had any luck with bows using crankbaits? Thx"
635732,crappieperchhunter,2011-10-30 01:28:00,2582,Nice gator Mike   reminds me of the Kawartha Muskie Beans got last year on a corn baited hair rig..fishing for carp   Still wish I had a camera that day  Life is like a box of chocolates Forest....
635746,jpfishing,2011-10-30 02:09:00,53,That picture may stop me from wading for steelhead anymore.
635753,danc,2011-10-30 02:24:00,4677,So you caught a small pike while Steelheading? Sorry about your bad luck Mike. I'd rather have caught a sucker. Much easier to shake off.
635755,Rizzo,2011-10-30 02:30:00,4754,wow thats a beauty pike
635761,MJL,2011-10-30 03:16:00,2427,"Very cool Mike. I've never seen a pike that big caught while fishing for steelhead. Funny enough, I've caught small ones on glo-bugs in spring.  On another note, which rod do you normally use for chucking hardware for steelhead?  I'm definitely in the market for a new spinner/spoon/kwikfish/crankbait rod for bigger rivers."
635812,solopaddler,2011-10-30 12:24:00,8605," I got a pair of hip boots for my daughter at Canadian Tire. At this point I'm restricting my son to shore fishing. I havn't been able to find waders small enough, plus he's really too small yet...  Your best bet locally would likely be Bass Pro though.    Looking forward to it Doug.    I use them probably 50% of the time now. Very specific colors and lures though, not just any small crankbait.  You also have to switch out the hooks as the hooks that they come with tend to get crushed by steelhead.    I have to admit I fibbed a bit Dan. I didn't catch the pike on a crankbait.  I was deadbaiting with one of these:    I find the vivid colors of spawning brook trout (aka bait) really attract the big gators.      I had an 11' 2pc 6-10lb CTS built for throwing hardware and bottom bouncing. Great stick, lots of power."

635911,highdrifter,2011-10-30 18:15:00,2534,Nice pike bud.  That be a Mega Bass Griffon per chance?!
636126,johnnyb,2011-10-31 13:38:00,3413,Big surprise indeed!!  The second pic really shows its brute-ishness...very cool  *edit*  Just saw the second page....deadbait....ROFL
636417,Aaron Shirley,2011-11-01 01:38:00,655,"Wow, that is a tank for a creek. Pretty awesome! Must have gave a wicked fight. You must have thought you hooked the mother of all steelhead at first  I caught a nice pike on the Grindstone years ago, but not close to being that big. That is a very rare catch. Congrats."
636583,ehg,2011-11-01 15:46:00,2666,What a great fish.  When throwing small crankbaits around trib estuaries those surprises make the day.
636655,SirCranksalot,2011-11-01 21:32:00,3291,"""I use them probably 50% of the time now. Very specific colors and lures though, not just any small crankbait.  You also have to switch out the hooks as the hooks that they come with tend to get crushed by steelhead."" Solopaddler---If it's not too much of a secret, could you tell us what lures and colors? I hear some folks swear by orange Rapalas. I thought Rapalas were too shallow. My fave bass lure is a crayfish pattern ""Big O"" which dives a bit deeper. So do you remove the trebles and replace with a single hook? thx"
636669,solopaddler,2011-11-01 22:54:00,8605,"  The number one steelhead crank for me is the Megabass MR-X Griffon. Anything with purple in it is deadly. Some of the darker more subtle colors work amazingly well on stale fish in clear water too.  http://www.megabassusa.com/products/mr-x-griffon   The hooks are switched out to more durable trebles. The ones they come with are razor sharp, but not strong enough.  I've also had huge success with a variety of similar Lucky Craft crankbaits.  I also use the standard stuff like Kwikfish, Flatfish, Rapalas, etc...  These little crankbaits really work though. Yes I know they're expensive but they produce fish."
636894,mirogak,2011-11-02 19:54:00,387,Loved that brookie shot - looked like from AP.
636963,mike rousseau,2011-11-03 01:07:00,4661,I got a pike one time reeling in my carp rig... Hit 2 kernals of corn...lol
637070,SirCranksalot,2011-11-03 15:52:00,3291,Thx Solopaddler for those details. I'll try to find some---probably easiest to order on-line.  Having a monster pike hit is great but don't you just hate it when one of those wet dishrags(aka walleye) grab it!!
635238,solopaddler,2011-10-28 16:18:00,8605,"Just thought I'd share this incredible catch.  The other day while throwing hardware for steelhead in the lower end of a favoured trib I caught the angling equivolent of a pink unicorn.  Yeah I've caught the odd pike before while steelheading but nothing quite this large.  40"" on the tape and pretty thick overall.  She completely engulfed my Griffon (small bass crankbait) as I reeled it slowly through the tailout of a huge pool.  Luckily she wasn't injured, was quickly unhooked, and after a couple of pic's swam away strongly.  Pretty cool eh?  Bloody awful pic's unfortunately, but I was alone at the time.     "
635240,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-10-28 16:19:00,0,that's pretty neat.  shame it wasn't on the float rod as i imagine that would be an interesting tussle on a pin (not that steelie leaders are gator friendly).
635244,mike rousseau,2011-10-28 16:24:00,4661,nice bonus catch
635255,Paulus,2011-10-28 16:33:00,522,"Very cool. Oh look!...    a PINK UNICORN! Go figure, and in character too!  But seriously, awesome catch and thanks for finally showing me the pic  p.-"
635256,mercman,2011-10-28 16:39:00,7054,"Beuatiful, clean looking Gator, Mike ! Nice surprise for sure."
635270,12footspringbok,2011-10-28 17:04:00,459,A pink unicorn on some tribs LOL... A nuisance equivalent to rock bass while walleye fishing on other rivers. Nice fish though. TFS
635284,Spiel,2011-10-28 17:28:00,9065,Braggart!  Did I spell that correctly?

635319,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-10-28 18:08:00,0,i bet there's a bunch of OFC lurkers heading out to their favourite steelie river with 100lb fluoro leaders and 6 inch flies under 20gram floats as we speak.
635334,I'mHooked,2011-10-28 18:48:00,525,What size main line would you recommend?  Nice incidental Solo.
635385,Jigger,2011-10-28 21:18:00,1237,That second pic is really cool! Nice pike for sure!!!
635412,misfish,2011-10-28 22:44:00,29133,"New name,Mikethepike.LOL  Nice healthy fish there bud."
635414,solopaddler,2011-10-28 22:52:00,8605, No kidding eh? I'll fish the rest of my life and never catch another pike like that under those circumstances though.  Thanks guys it really was a pretty cool thing.
635442,fishindude,2011-10-29 00:49:00,220,"Beautiful fish Solopaddler, looks real healthy.  Great catch"
635461,northernpike56,2011-10-29 01:39:00,717,SWEET!!!
635467,msp,2011-10-29 01:52:00,1336,"Thats great. I have caught them on roe on the float rod before, but never that big. Its to bad you didnt have someone there to snap a pic. Nice fish for an incedental catch."
635475,Dozer,2011-10-29 02:25:00,896,"Great fish!  I'll say one thing, I wasn't sure what to expect seeing a post titled a BIG surprise on the creek by solopaddler.  I was thinking he may have gotten skunked!  That'd be a big surprise."
635477,Joey,2011-10-29 02:44:00,9122,Nice!!!!!
635481,spinnerdoc,2011-10-29 03:00:00,556,"Finally a report from solopaddler. Wondering when the steelhead report gonna be  A kidding aside that is a very nice looking pike, what a surprise ey?"
635482,Pikeslayer8,2011-10-29 03:01:00,336,"Anytime, anywhere a 40"" pike is caught is awesome.   Seems everywhere you go, adventure is sure to follow."
635508,solopaddler,2011-10-29 12:05:00,8605, I'm going to post something in the near future. Highlight of the month so far was my 5 yr old catching his first steelhead.  Still have a report to post on my trip to Nakina last month as well...  October's been a busy month.
635509,lew,2011-10-29 12:11:00,12766,"Beautiful fish Mike, big incidentals are always a bonus  !!"
635511,Roy,2011-10-29 12:32:00,13728,"That really is a nice fish. Just curious Mike, did the pike hit long into the retrieve? And if it hit at the start of the retrieve, how long did it take you to realize that it was a pike. I ask because neither of these fish react the same way but if you're really not expecting a pike.... ?"
635515,ccmtcanada,2011-10-29 13:01:00,7971,Wow Mike!  You beat my personal best pike while steelheading.....show off lol  Seriously though.....we gotta get out soon....bring that Bill guy too....you two are a blast to fish with!
