Initial research tells me there is excellent trout fishing there, especially in the fall and winter.  I am thinking of extending my trip to fit in some fishing.  Wondering if anybody fished there?  Thx and cheers."
637082,Harrison,2011-11-03 17:51:00,2202,"Never fished there, but I suggest getting a 2500 yrd spool of line though."
637084,Rod Caster,2011-11-03 17:55:00,5784,  and a loooong handle net
637095,mercman,2011-11-03 18:31:00,7054,"Practice your flippin too.Some places the walls are not completely vertical. All joking aside, i've been there twice,not to fish though, besides beautiful to behold, i spoke with a few of the Hualapai indians while there and the trout fishing is sposed to be beyond belief.I was told that the east end of the park has the best trout fishing.The west end is muddier and less productive for Trout.The indians do alot of carp fishing in the western part, if you are into that.  "
637102,mirogak,2011-11-03 18:51:00,387, Thanks but I don't care much about carp - it is the trout I am chasing.

637126,Jds63,2011-11-03 20:07:00,1365,"I have been to the Grand Canyon as well but never fished it, it is truly an amazing place.  If fly fishing you may want to hire a guide ...  here are some links i found  http://www.frommers.com/destinations/grandcanyonnationalpark/2284020352.html  http://www.leesferryflyfishing.com/index.htm"
637182,adolson,2011-11-03 22:05:00,783,"Lucky! I saw the episode of Extreme Fishing with Robson Green where he fished there, and I believe they were catching rainbows in there. I would love to go there, but it'll never happen."
637185,mercman,2011-11-03 22:08:00,7054,"  weekend packages to Las Vegas are dirt cheap Dana, then book a hummer tour of the Canyon from there(2 hours away).It will change your soul."
637188,mirogak,2011-11-03 22:14:00,387," Honestly, was thinking doing that myself.  It starts around the Hoover dam and down to the Canyon.  Hear there are two creeks with awesome bows down there."
637190,mirogak,2011-11-03 22:16:00,387, Thanks bud - I will check'em out as I will have my new used rod with me  - the one I got from Craigslist and Mike appraised at $150
637191,adolson,2011-11-03 22:16:00,783,"Well, unfortunately I'm not likely to ever fly there until the radiation blasters and the Trained Sexual Assaulters are removed from airports... So it will never happen for me. But it's OK - I am from northern Ontario, and there is enough beauty here for my soul. <3"
637192,mirogak,2011-11-03 22:18:00,387," Really - but I am going to be camping as well.  I think there are campsites near Bright Angel Creek which has rainbows, Apache trout, browns, and Brookieeeeeeeees .... eeeha"
637193,mercman,2011-11-03 22:18:00,7054," I was there 3 years ago.Just before i got back into fishing.If i go again, i will defiantely bring a rod and reel. Lake Mead has a phenomenal fishery also."
637218,mirogak,2011-11-03 23:32:00,387, Well said Dana
