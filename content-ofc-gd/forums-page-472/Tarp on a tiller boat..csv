636626,linweir,2011-11-01 19:45:00,202,"Plan to cover my 16.5 ft tiller boat after winterizing it. Wonder if I can simply cover tarp on it? Maybe I can keep the trailer ""head up"" in order to move snow down."
636628,mike rousseau,2011-11-01 19:54:00,4661,do yourself a favor and get a boat cover....  i got one for my first boat at canadian tire on sale for around 80 bucks... had it 4 years and it went when i sold the boat... still in mint condition...  this way it puts your mind at ease... and it is easy to remove and store as well...

636641,lookinforwalleye,2011-11-01 20:34:00,4399,"Don`t know what type of boat ya have but what I did for the Stratos is this,  put the pedestal posts in the front and rear bases and cut some pvc pipe to fit over the posts and then ran a 2x2 the full lenght of the boat to form a frame, ran some rope off the cleats for some support and then tarped it. Works like a charm."
636644,Roy,2011-11-01 20:50:00,13728," What he said. Just a tarp won't hold the weight of the snow. It's very easy to put a frame under there. While you're at it, it'll only take you a few minutes to jack the trailer up a little and put it on blocks. Your tires will thank you and so will your suspension. Ah what the heck...give your wheels a spin and wobble them back and forth to check that your bearings are ok."
636648,lew,2011-11-01 21:02:00,12766," Absolutely Roy, I've been storing my boat/trailer on jacks for years."
636649,skinny,2011-11-01 21:04:00,442,I made a A frame out of Abs tube that sits on the seats of my 16ft tiller then I put the cover I got from Bass pro on and for winter I cover it all with a plastic tarp andput the nose high .  boat is covered in my drive if I get time will take a pic
636657,linweir,2011-11-01 21:47:00,202,Great tips. Thankx Roy. By the way I do have a boat cover but I don't think it's completely waterproof.
636668,Muskieman,2011-11-01 22:53:00,2472, Put the tarp on the cover....  and what Roy said.  Randy 
636676,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-01 23:40:00,10439,I have a cover that keeps the dust etc. out of the boat but I park the boat inside one of those portable garages to keep the snow off. I purchased the garage on sale for $250 at CT and this will be it's 5th winter. I go out and knock the snow off the roof after a storm and because of this it has held up really well. I have 2 of the 10'X20' and one 10'X10'. They work great for storing all of my toys.  Not a great shot but you can see the portable garage in the background.

636696,John Bacon,2011-11-02 00:46:00,3277,"My dad has some brackets for making saw horses. I run a 14' 2x6"" between them and it supports the cover for almost the whole length of the boat."
636772,Fish4Eyes,2011-11-02 11:53:00,1022,"As mentioned above you definetely need to create some kind of slope. Even with the slope, in cold weather, you will still need to remove the snow off the cover. If your not storing the boat at home, be sure to check on it after every snow storm."
636790,bigbuck,2011-11-02 13:29:00,2449,I just winterized and tarped my Larson on the weekend. I used 2x6 posts with notches with a 16' 2x6 going across the boat. All screwed together and a 28x20 tarp tied down to the trailer and she's done for the winter. Make sure you have the bow up a bit with the engine all the way down and the plug out. Any water that does make it's way in there will be able to run out. Can't wait for May to come so I can head up and pick up my boat and summerize her.
636794,limeyangler,2011-11-02 13:47:00,5204,A tarp will be fine. Just make sure you have something to act as a type of 'A' frame like the others have said.  My 16.5 tiller stays outside all winter under a cheap CT tarp. Its not pretty but there are bungee cords and rope all over the place to make sure its covered properly.  I use the summer tires from our 2 vehicles to make the 'A' frame. I also store lots of other stuff in there too...very usefull place to store stuff
