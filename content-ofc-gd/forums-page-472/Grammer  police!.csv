636510,craigdritchie,2011-11-01 12:30:00,1586,"I earn a living as the Director of Editorial for a large publishing company, where I oversee several different magazines. I sold my first magazine article in 1978 and since then, my work has since appeared in magazines, books and newspapers published on three different continents. I now supervise a staff or editors who fine-tune the work of award-winning writers. By this point in time, I like to think I have a reasonable command of the English language.  And still, my own posts on this board (and on my blog) still contain occasional typos. Hey man, it happens. I'm not getting paid for any of this, so I won't lose any sleep over a minor error here and there - by me, or anyone else.  But that's a big difference from those ""R any of U guyz goin to Brontey 2nite to snag nooks?"" posts, where the person writing it isn't even trying to be clear. I find those insulting. The writer was too lazy to make the effort to communicate clearly, and apparently expects me to make the effort to figure it all out. Forget that.  Typos happen, and who cares if someone makes a minor grammatical error? When you at least make the effort, it shows a level of respect toward the people who read it. To me, at least, that counts far more than perfect spelling or grammar."

As far as not bothering to read any of the poorly written messages on Plenty of Fish...I will clarify that most of them started with ""hey babe waz'up""! And sometimes that's all they said. So yes, I chose to overlook those! Haha! And Rob (whose message I did reply to and is now my other half) is not some hot shot pencil pusher. He's a humble fitter/welder (with the shop talk and rough edges to match!) who had never even used a computer before buying one to go on the dating website after some peer pressure! It would take him an hour to type one paragraph and then he would proof read it before he sent it. I just wanted to clarify that that was the comparison I was making and not at all meaning to come across as insulting anyone.  My sister has learning disabilities and although she was unable to go through main stream high school, she does just fine for herself now and I have always been very proud of her.  My main beef is more with our younger generation becoming lazy in writing as they Text or MSN. And I do see the English language suffering with this generation because of instant messaging. My 16 year old son is the perfect example. He knows how to spell and use grammar (somewhat! Haha!), and he sure knows how to use spellcheck, but he chooses not to. And I love him dearly I just could kick his pen and paper lazy behind!  So as I have followed this thread and seen the offense taken, I just wanted to clarify that for myself I in no way intended to come across as discriminating against illiteracy or learning disabilities. And I have never corrected anyone in a forum (except for merc's ""cents"" comment which was all in good fun! )."

But this remark in it's self...you gotta see that's a little harsh  In all Seriousness I know your not meaning to be offensive...I've been around long enough to know your usual disposition and I didn't take exception to your post And likewise I certainly didn't mean to stir any pots.  I simply felt if we're discussing the efforts required to make a post acceptable, We should also be aware of what that's asking of some people and maybe take away some perspective on how to deal with it in the future while avoiding conflict.  Put simply, We just need to be respectful. People need to put effort into making their posts coherent and like wise if its not, I think people need to be respectful in asking for clarification as opposed to public humiliation techniques such as corrections and assumptions of someone’s intelligence.  I think that's a pretty fair and for this motley crew I'd bet for the most part its common sense"

I sometimes miss words or change the thought I was trying to type because my brain has moved on to the next word/sentence but my fingers are still typing eight words behind  it gets confusing   it's why I don't go to the chat rooms very often by the time I have my sentence typed everyone else has moved on to something else.........but lets make fun of that and lets put someone down because typing/spelling/grammar isn't the best..hell it make us feel more important when we put some down   but I almost never read posts/threads that are in capitals or in large bold fonts..for some reason I have trouble reading them

I stated in my first post after joing OFC/OFC that my sspelling is (atrocius) I would like to to think that it has come a long way(thanks to OFC )  To see a topic like this is somewhat offencive.  I work with people every day that can barely speek english but are intelegent and highly skilled.    To say that a person is ignorant or not worthy of concideration soely based on thier mastery of the english language is rediculous!!! That statement  is  Ignorant within itself....   SALTYDAWG
635752,Twocoda,2011-10-30 02:23:00,4130,Salty - your effort with your spelling/grammar is poifect...i think what the original poster was trying to convey was if people take the same pride into thier posts as they do of a picture of themselves holding a fish.....then the whole world would be poifect ( even with its flaws on poipuse)
635900,Cookslav,2011-10-30 17:05:00,1457,"For the record I have not taken any offence, and for what its worth, I'm fairly sure I am not one of the crazy bad posters.  I just thought I'd chime in and push a thought into the back of peoples minds... Some of these horrible posts may in fact be someone’s best effort, or at the very least a ""recreational"" effort. I figured if we are going to discuss the expectations of posts we should at least remember sometimes its not that easy...that's all. I didn't intend to make it a heavy conversation.  Yes some of the comments insinuating that its perhaps so easy, or the intelligent thing to do is boarder line offensive, but I'm pretty thick skinned  Had I been 20 years younger I'd be insulted, but that would be a confidence issue. Now many years later I'm fully aware of my my limits, my potential, My true IQ and my successes in life. Being a slow reader/writer is not an intelligence ""thing"" but sometimes people assume it is...So some people get a bit sensitive about it so please tread carefully.  If anything that's the point I'd like to make."

I had no intention to insult or belittle anyone in my original post. I was simply trying to get the roughly 1% of the posters here to maybe include a comma or period now and then. I'll be the first to point out that I am a horrific speller... but funny enough, I am an excellent proof reader of other peoples' work... go figure, so I guess I have a disability as well. Guys, this is not Shakespeare, it a fishing site... but, if you can't create a paragraph, can't use a comma or a period, then MAYBE you should consider using a spell/grammar check before you post, if you wish folks to read the post and continue your topic... that was my intent, however it seems some here have to break out their big spoon and still the pot...

In the last 50 posts or so people talked about learning disabilities and some have come out with them - and while their posts may not have been perfect it didn't matter because they were coherent and effort was clearly put into them, and the message was conveyed.  The point isn't to offend these people.  But when someone posts something like:  hey guys i gunna go too lake grammer dis satuday i never bean befoare can sumone ofer tips i no tha fhish are in their also what bate do i use thanks al for advise  That just pisses me off.  If you are going to ask for advice, you are asking people to put in effort that they don't have to put in to help you.  So put in some effort yourself into at least some punctuation and close to proper spelling and spacing so it's not an eyesore to read."

When I'm posting here I have to think hard…type…think…type…edit….think…edit….spell check etc. Not occasionally, but Every  single time I post something of any calibre. In truth I probably  work a little harder then most when putting a post together not because I take it more serious then others, but because I know I have to or it’ll come out as gibberish. A post like this can take me 30 minutes LOL...sad but true  This is a recreational outlet for me, so if I don’t make sense, or my punctuation/spelling is off key I apologize. But turning the table I’d appreciate it if the spelling police were respectful. I'm here for fun, not to be judged...  I often type as I would speak, forgetting grammar…its easy, fast and I’d like to think the point gets across. I’d hope if I am not making sense someone would ask a clarifying question, as opposed to poking fun at me...

635640,Grimace,2011-10-29 21:40:00,2020,"That, I guess could be the point here.   If you take the time and try very hard then what is preventing someone without the same challenges from just taking a moment?  It does not have to be perfect, none of us are.  I feel that some of the posters are not even trying and some posts are incomprehensible.  I love the English language and I feel that it makes perfect sense.

In saying that...it shouldn't have to be more then a quick proof read to ensure your point is in the body of the statement IMO.  In saying that, Emoticons, slang and informal speak is totally acceptable in this environment if your asking me. I would not be expected to use proper language in a bar, or at the rink when speaking the language however It would be the expectation at work...so there's a time and a place for each. For this reason alone I'd say here in the ""winternet"" season among friends on a message board I'd say We should be exempt from the spelling/grammar police. Different strokes for different folks"

Your point is well made and I agree.  The only posts that really bother me are the long ramblings with no punctuation and no sentence structure.  Slang, emoticons and all that stuff do not bother me any way, shape, or form. Another pet peeve I suppose would be thread titles with simple words like `most` spelled `moost` for example and the OP does not bother to change it.  Cookslav, I do not know much about dyslexia.  I am guessing that it would be easier for you to disipher a well typed out statement than one that was poorly done.  I would have also figured that since you take the time and determination to type your thoughts out in a very comprehensible manner, you would be a little more inclined to think that others should as well.  Anyways, I certainly appreciate and to be frank, admire the way you challenge yourself to use proper grammar and sentence structure.  Thumbs up.  As for me, I just try my best and am often far from perfect but I hope I am always understood.  Edited to add:   Sorry, I guess the thread was pretty much done.   Cheers!!"

The music side of it is simple, I have no sense or rythum and can't tell the differance between a C sharp and a D flat. God just didn't give my those abilities.  As for the spelling, well it just isn't logical. Words that sound the same but are spelled differently. Words that are spelled the same but mean different things depending on the context they are used in. Too many rules with too many exceptions and I have a problem with things that aren't logical.  Give me a motor that isn't running right, something that needs to be built or fixed, anything that requires a mechanical aptitude or logical reasioning and I have no problem working that out. Algebra, trigonometry, geometry,  were all a breeze for me in college as were physics and science.  I also type at about 12 words a minute, so very often when replying to a post on here I spend a lot of time composing my responses. I suppose I could cut and paste and do the spell check thing, but for the most part I think people can understand what I am trying to get across even if there are a few grammer or spelling mistakes.  I do have a solution though, if my spelling, punctuation, or grammer are that much of a problem just don't bother reading my posts!"

635293,Woodsman,2011-10-28 17:35:00,1286,Within reason who really cares. OK I've seen some posts that leave me shaking my head. If spelling is slightly off or grammar not perfect I don't give a rats arse as long as I can understand the message. For some posters English is not their first language (but their trying their best) and spell check corrections only make it more confusing for them. Lets not forget the purpose of this forum is to share information with our fellow fishermen(fisherwomen).

I don't want to nit pick, but of late I have seen some horrendous spelling and grammar from some folks posting and frankly, the impression it leaves on the reader is one of ""huh""!? As a reader of your post, we can only equate who you are and what you are saying, based on what you type. If you type/spell badly, that is the impression we the reader will have of you, as a person. It is very simple to use ""Word"" to spell check, just cut and paste your post into Word and check it. Then, cut and paste your post back into OFC... tada, you're done! It aint pretty, but it is what it is! Thanks folks! HH"

Hehe!). As a female on a dating website, you get a lot of messages. So many of them contained horrible spelling and no punctuation that I couldn't understand them at all! The nude pics were starting to go from annoying to more preferable as at least I didn't need to try to figure out what they meant!  It got to the point I didn't bother looking at their profile if they couldn't take the time to use a simple spell check. I figured if they aren't going to put any effort into that, what else are they not going to put effort into!  I am sooooo totally NOT high maintenance as this post might suggest (in fact, the complete opposite!)...but communication is key! Of course most people aren't Shakespeare (I can barely make out half the stuff my son writes!). It's just about making the effort to correct what you can when it's so easy now so you are better understood.  Rob's spelling and grammar were perfect in his first message to me that I replied. And we went on a blind date and have been together for 3 1/2 years since!"
