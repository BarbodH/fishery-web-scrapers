636864,kickingfrog,2011-11-02 17:30:00,8333," Good point. I'd run a day's pay through the engine, fix my hair and have a smile for a month."
636867,walleyemen,2011-11-02 17:36:00,316,Hair????LOL
636871,fishnsled,2011-11-02 18:04:00,3520," Hmmmm......At my age, I need all the help I can get, might have to keep the boat if I won it. At least until the girlfriend found out why I was keeping it."
636872,BillM,2011-11-02 18:09:00,17367,"Sell it, buy a Lund Tyee Grand Sport or similar."
632599,The Urban Fisherman,2011-10-20 13:10:00,2050,"Well I wasn't there this year - so I saw it online just the same as everybody else - He looks pretty stinkin' happy....and is one lucky dude!  Big thanks to all of the great sponsors who were involved, and especially Subway for for consistently stepping up to the plate and supporting the sport we love so much!  Here's the link to Dave's blog and the video:  http://www.factsoffishing.com/blog/dave-mercer/dave-mercer-announces-winner-of-hook-line-and-subway%c2%ae-contest/  Cheers, Ryan"
632603,Roy,2011-10-20 13:21:00,13728,Excellent! That dude doesn't look too happy at all eh? A big thanks to Dave Mercer and to SUBWAYÂ® along with all else who made this happen. Thanks Ryan for sharing this with us.
632612,LucG,2011-10-20 13:50:00,779,Watching that gave me goose bumps!!! Congrats to the winner!
632616,Adam Delves,2011-10-20 14:08:00,28,That Subway is about 5 blocks from where I live. My kids will be happy to see that boat around our area. Congrats.
632649,GBW,2011-10-20 16:45:00,8460,glad to see he was happy about it.  now what about the other winners?
632662,motion,2011-10-20 17:54:00,403,I was hoping it was a fellow OFC'er. It would have been nice to see a little more emotion from the winner though.
632675,Handlebarz,2011-10-20 19:19:00,3790,Dang he was happy Congrats to him and thanks to all involved to make it happen Dave your one of a kind keep at it.
632678,captpierre,2011-10-20 19:40:00,2521,Love the hair joke at the end!   Wonder if he has a suitable tow vehicle
632681,fishnsled,2011-10-20 19:56:00,3520,Congrats to David Baker! Enjoy the new ride!
632684,misfish,2011-10-20 20:00:00,29133,"If I have to eat 1000 combos to win,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IM DOING IT.  And believe me,you wont find it on some selling site.     Does anyone know if the winner from last year sold his?"
632688,Joey,2011-10-20 20:10:00,9122,"Congrats to the winner, what a great contest!  You go B, eat those subs"
632691,misfish,2011-10-20 20:17:00,29133,  I need a written signed contract first J.
632700,MCTFisher9120,2011-10-20 20:40:00,3761,"I think next year I'm going to buy a sub...hopefully the contest is going again. Congrads to the guy, couldn't be happier"
636831,Krisco,2011-11-02 15:21:00,67,Well if any OFNer would like to own it they can check it out on Kijji Hamilton!
636833,GBW,2011-11-02 15:24:00,8460,got a link?
636835,fishnsled,2011-11-02 15:27:00,3520,
636836,LucG,2011-11-02 15:29:00,779,
636837,kickingfrog,2011-11-02 15:39:00,8333,"I can't fault him for selling it. I do the same, I don't own a vehicle capable of towing that rig. I'd sure turn it into a rig and a trip, or two, in a heart beat though."
636838,fishnsled,2011-11-02 15:50:00,3520,"  I would most likely do the same, after a few test spins of course. Well might not sell it after that. Nice chunk of change once it's sold."
636840,Raf,2011-11-02 15:58:00,3495,I'd be selling it too.. after a couple of WOT runs of course.  Not my kinda boat.
636850,Billy Bob,2011-11-02 16:43:00,5865,WOW......that was fun to watch.....  And I would NOT sell it.......hook it up to my Tundra....load my dog Tundra into said truck and go FISHING>>>>>>>>errrrrr Catching....  Bob
636858,LucG,2011-11-02 17:09:00,779,I wouldn't sell it even if I had to get it to the water by hand! lol
636859,Miracon,2011-11-02 17:18:00,200,"Thanks for sharing the video! It was fun to watch!  Unless my 10 yr old rusty PT Cruiser could tow it, I'd have to sell it too. But it would definitely be to buy a truck and a little less impressive fishing boat to start off with!"
636861,Jds63,2011-11-02 17:20:00,1365,"Wow great video ... a very happy lad indeed ... I would be too ...  I guess selling it or keeping it all depends on where your'e at in life , for an older fella like me the cash would come in handy for a lot of things, for some of the young guns it maybe a chick magnet on the water"
636862,livinisfishin,2011-11-02 17:22:00,661,Pretty sweet!
