I am going to Beijing in January for work, and want to bring my phone to utilize its features such as wifi, camera, aps etc...  Since I don't want to run up an enormous bill by roaming, I am afraid of bringing it with me. I know how to turn off the network connection, but am unsure if this will prevent any charges.  Just so I am clear, I dont intend on using it to make calls/texts.  Any advice is apreciated. Thanks in advance!"
636816,LucG,2011-11-02 14:49:00,779,"Oh yeah, forgot one thing? Anyone know any hot spots to fish in Beijing? lol"
636820,GBW,2011-11-02 14:52:00,8460,"what phone do you have?  I know with my blackberry I can turn off data and network (turn roaming off) so I will not get text's, emails and calls while away."
636822,LucG,2011-11-02 14:54:00,779," Excatly!  My phone is the HTC Desire.  I have the same feature, but when I tried testing it, I was still able to send receive calls/texts."
636825,GBW,2011-11-02 14:59:00,8460,call your service provider
636834,quickme,2011-11-02 15:25:00,261,"i'm not 100% it would work but get a sim card that is not hooked up and put it in there.  You'll be able to use the camera, apps and wifi but it won't be linked to any number to get charged."
636839,BillM,2011-11-02 15:56:00,17367,Buy a sim card once you get to Beijing and never worry about roaming charges.
636844,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-02 16:16:00,10439,  Yup.
636847,LucG,2011-11-02 16:30:00,779, I never though of that. I'm sure I'll be able to buy one for next to nothing.  Thanks Guys!
