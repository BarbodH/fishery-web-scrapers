636101,Big Cliff,2011-10-31 12:24:00,6899,"Well, it started out at 2:00 am last Friday, our much anticipated fishing trip with Lloyd of U & Me Fishing Charters which he had so kindly donated for the Fishing for Tyler fund raiser.  Pikeslayer Jr. and I met up with John at the Fifth Wheel truck stop in Bowmanville about 3:40 am for breakfast (Simon would have joind us but got Bowmanville and Bellville mixed up and had already passed us by the time he realized the mistake).  Introductions, a hearty breakfast and we were on our way to Picton shortly after 4:00. The trip down was pretty uneventful, but it was nice to have a chance to catch up on things with John. There isn't much traffic on the 401 at that time in the morning and we made really good time.  We arrived at the dock in Picton at 6:00, it was cold and everything was covered in frost but Lloyd had the boat all warmed up for us so it was quite comfortable, he has a really nice set up there.  More introductions, got our gear all stowed, Lloyd gave us a brief rundown of safety gear and where everything was located if it should be needed and away we went before the sun had even started to come up.  It didn't take very long and it was ""fish on"". A large sheephead, boy can those things ever fight. Lloyd had told us before heading out that fishing had been really slow and that no one had been catching any numbers of walleye. We really didn't care, we were fishing, that is all that mattered.  The fishing conditions weren't exactly perfect, very light winds, and bright sun, a nice day to be on the water but tough to get the walleye to bite, we were marking lots of fish but they seemed to have lock jaw.  Lloyd kept working, changing lures, changing speed, changing depths. A couple of more sheepheads, a couple of missed hits then our first gold. A beautiful 7 lb walleye in the boat. Lloyd kept checking with the other charter boats but they weren't having any luck at all.  As the sun got higher in the sky I kept thinking perhaps the wind would pick up a bit and give us a bit of a chop which would help, they had been forecasting winds of 15 k out of the NW. I don't think they had even reached 5K by lunch time. None the less, Lloyd's hard work was paying off and we were putting fish in the boat, more nice shephead and more gold mostly in around the 7 lb range.  Alas, a fishing trip can't last forever and the day was done. We headed back to the dock with 5 beautiful walleye landed (I don't know how many sheephead) and everyone talking about what a wonderful time we'd had and how much we had learned from Lloyd.  All in all it was a wonderful day, good friends, some nice fish in the boat and I learned a few new tricks from Lloyd that I am anxious to try here on Sturgeon Lake.  Thanks Lloyd for your generous donation to the Fishing for Tyler auction without which I probably would never have had the chance to meet you and for a wonderful day on the water. I'll be back again!"
636103,Roy,2011-10-31 12:32:00,13728,Sounds like a great time Cliff. Glad you all had a good day.
636105,oldphart,2011-10-31 12:43:00,665,"~~~~Great report bud, but where's the pics, or a least hand drawn crayon pics???"
636109,skeeter,2011-10-31 12:54:00,1907,Great report Cliff!! Fishing is about the time you spend with friends and mother nature. The numbers you catch are an added bonus.
636110,Big Cliff,2011-10-31 12:55:00,6899,"Thanks! Pikeslayer and Lloyd took all the pictures, hopfully they will add them to the thread shortly."
636120,johnnyb,2011-10-31 13:22:00,3413,"Sounds like another great day aboard ""The Party Palace""....maybe the nice weather is keeping the fish a bit too comfy...they gotta put that feedbag on soon"
636123,bigugli,2011-10-31 13:29:00,6138,Sounds like another great day on the water.  Gonna have to make that trip one day.
636533,corvette1,2011-11-01 13:23:00,1765,awesome day on the water cliff
636550,fishnsled,2011-11-01 14:36:00,3520,"Great report Cliff, always a great day with Lloyd. It's amazing what you can learn in 8 hours eh?   Was chatting with Lloyd last night and he has a couple of openings still available for this fall. If you are thinking about doing a charter, give Lloyd a call. (905) 375-0177."
636574,Joey,2011-11-01 15:30:00,9122,That's great Cliff.  Glad you all had a great day
636582,Terry,2011-11-01 15:41:00,14456,sounds like another great trip with Lloyd
636596,ccmtcanada,2011-11-01 17:26:00,7971,Great report Cliff!  Wish I could have made it...although 3:40 is a little early...LOL.  It always seems Lloyd gets his clients on fish no matter how tough the fishing is.  I've had the pleasure of being on board his boat and it's amazing to see all his tactics...he works very hard out there.  Hoping to try out those things you learned with you on Sunday on your home lake...assuming the wind forecast of 25 to 30km/h doesn't keep us off the water!
636598,Miracon,2011-11-01 17:41:00,200,Awesome report Cliff! Can't wait for the pics. Gonna save my nickles so I can give Lloyd a call in the future! He sounds like an awesome guide!
636622,Pikeslayer,2011-11-01 19:23:00,1443,"Here's the pix...........  Sean's first & PB sheephead......    John's farm animal.............    My best of the day...............    Cliff's best of the day..........    Then John's...................    Another PB for Sean..............    As a bonus, we had a full time escort for the day...................    Happy fisherman after a day on board U & Me with Captain Lloyd (who needs to work on his camera skills LOL)    A big thanks to Lloyd for a great day and a 'lesson learned'; Stick with your program and persevere. And thank you Cliff for picking up the slack on this post. I had a few things go sideways the last few days. Thank you my friend. As well, it was a pleasure to finally meet up with John and last but not least, a bonus day spent with my son Sean (who has been kidnapped by Cliff & Sue).  Cheers all, Simon"
636634,Rod Caster,2011-11-01 20:22:00,5784,"Sheephead. Isn't that what they use in haagus? Sounds like a great time! Gotta love nice weather, gold and the fight of a freshwater drum."
636636,mercman,2011-11-01 20:24:00,7054,Nice going guys !!! those are some real tanks !!!  
636700,asdve23rveavwa,2011-11-02 00:53:00,2690,"Always a good time with Lloyd.  Some nice gold, and, I can back you up on the sheepshead statement.  Nailed a 17 + lber out with Lloyd last year, hit and fought like a salmon!"
636727,Big Cliff,2011-11-02 02:10:00,6899,"Symon, we didn't kidnap him, we adopted him! Thanks for posting the pictures!  I have had the pleasere of fishing with a few professional guides on this board, all were fantastic and Lloyd sure didn't drop the ball either. I'd recommend him anytime!"
636753,Aaron Shirley,2011-11-02 03:49:00,655,Looks like a great day out for such slow conditions. Nice.
636961,fishhunter,2011-11-03 01:06:00,604,It was so nice having you out. Nothing better then a day on the water laughing and enjoying each others company with fish as a bonus. I hope we get to do it again
