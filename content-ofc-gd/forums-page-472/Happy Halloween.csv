636157,lew,2011-10-31 14:58:00,12766,"Great job on the carvings Geoff, too bad about the neighborhood bozo's though !!"
636215,manitoubass2,2011-10-31 17:15:00,11391,"    Here is a few pics of mine. Turned out ok but I wish I would have got a bigger pumpkin, lol. I carved it with my fillet knife, worked really good.  That sucks that your got smashed up, thats a real bummer.  Dan Bouck (I cant remember which thread?) but he had a really nice carving too!"
636216,ccmtcanada,2011-10-31 17:20:00,7971,Great pumpkins Geoff!!  I learned the hard way years ago about putting them outside like that.  Now they sit in the kitchen or garage until Hallowe'en night...then I put them on the front porch.
636218,GBW,2011-10-31 17:25:00,8460,thanks all I too used my fillet knife and it worked real well too going to do some more tonight as I still have the printouts to do them again. the odd thing is my area is full of kids that are 10 and under and maybe one teen.
636221,Fish4Eyes,2011-10-31 17:30:00,1022,"Nice pumpkins. Sorry to hear they got smashed.  I was weiry myself leaving them outside last night as child hood memories came to mind . Not that i'm complaining, but it seems ""devils night"" has come and passed. In my younger days, cops would stop all groups of kids walking the streets on Oct 30th and search them for eggs ."

636286,GBW,2011-10-31 20:53:00,8460,very cool Colin  it turns out the big pumpkins made it to the garage last night and just the small one broken (Batman one) was ours.  the neighbours found some kids running around at midnight and noticed the pumpkin was missing and smashed all over my driveway.  no wonder I didn't get a call from crying kids today.
636296,Billy Bob,2011-10-31 21:17:00,5865,THEY LOOK FANTASTIC......  I just love pumpkins......I drive my duck hunting partners crazy as I look for the cheapest pumpkins I can find after the hunt.  A few years ago I was driving east on Rt 20 near the Finger Lakes around November 20th.....I came across a few fields that had THOUSANDS and THOUSANDS of pumpkins still laying there.....just like a corn field but pumpkins as far as the eye could see....
636305,misfish,2011-10-31 21:57:00,29133,"  Thats just NASTY.   Nice carving guys. Havent carved one since the boys stopped trick and treat,n. Dont get kids here so I dont bother. Like Geoff,they would probly get smashed anyways."
