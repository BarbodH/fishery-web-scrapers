636038,peter23,2011-10-31 01:53:00,95,"hey guys ice fishing is coming up soon and me and my family are planning on doing a lot of ice fishing for lakers this year. we always go up to a lodge for walleye for a couple days but now we want to find one that is good for ice fishing lake trout. they dont have to be big, we are just looking to get some decent numbers. it has to be a drive to place and a drive about 7 hours away from toronto. are there any lodges you guys have stayed in the past that have met what i am looking for?   thanks!"
