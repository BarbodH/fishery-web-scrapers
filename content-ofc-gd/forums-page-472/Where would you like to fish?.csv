634571,Victor,2011-10-26 22:30:00,1609,everything you've got there would be on my list as well. Add in Carp fishing @ the St.Lawrence & Smallie/trout fishing in the Algonquin back lakes.
637057,manitoubass2,2011-11-03 14:56:00,11391,and I'll add Russia for pikeperch  That would be amazing!

637164,Big Cliff,2011-11-03 21:37:00,6899,"I guess I have been very lucky as there isn't anything on your list that I haven't done yet.  If I could have my dream trip though it would be for my son and I to fly into some remote upper scale camp c/w a chief, and guide. I would want the plane to pick us up at our dock here on Sturgeon Lake, fly us into wherever it is that we go and fly us back here when our trip was done. I would want us to have to do nothing but catch fish and eat fantastic meals for the time we were there! Nothing but first class all the way.  Saddly I can't ever see that dream coming true, money and time just won't allow it but it's ok to dream sometimes. Why not, how many people dream of winning the lottery every week!  Locally though; I'd like to go sauger fishing with Marc Thorp again, Fishmaster for cat fish, Lloyd for BOQ walleye, Bruce for smelts, CPH for Simco perch, the list is just too long LOL."
637173,TDunn,2011-11-03 21:47:00,680,  Anytime Frank!  As for me....I'd love to spend some time on Lake of the Woods chasing musky and pike.....maybe a day or two of lakers on Athabasca too!!   TDunn

637297,Bob Devine,2011-11-04 03:37:00,251,"Call me lucky but my backyard has just about everything I need.  Walleye jigging on the Detroit River, trolling lake Erie for walleyes. Musky fishing on Lake St Clair, bass fishing on Erie and LSC, perch fishing on Erie and more open water fishing with steelhead on Erie. There are 4 Ontario records from the area, one of the crappies- white or black, yellow perch, sauger and white bass striper cross. Yes there are some great areas but to have so many choices in the Windsor area its hard to leave."
637302,crossover,2011-11-04 03:54:00,172,"Seeing as how I don't have a car, I would really like to try the eastern tribs for steelhead. I've also seen a report on here before about some resort on Richter Lake, the walleye fishing looked fantastic."

You can fish up there all day and even if you get skunked, you've still spent the day looking at some of the prettiest scenery you'll ever find anywhere.  And to me, that's what it's all about !!"

634074,ccmtcanada,2011-10-25 18:05:00,7971,"As we were all talking on the weekend about our fishing adventures, I realized that there are many ""local"" areas I'd love to fish...but for some reason, I haven't gone.  It may be because time is limited, or I don't have the confidence to take my little boat on bigger or strange waters, or I don't have the expertise or know-how in certain types of fishing and locations.  Being a relative newbie angler, there's always breaking that knowledge barrier.  I have put in a lot of time and effort into things like bass/walleye/muskie fishing Kawartha lakes, carp fishing using boilies and mixing my own ground bait, pounding local creeks for steelhead and casting for salmon from piers, but I have lots of things on my to do list still.  Anyhow, what is ""close by"" to you?  Is there something you'd like to try or a place you'd like to venture?  Here's what's on my list...they are all local to me...just haven't gotten around to them yet...  1) Steelhead fishing the niagara...either from shore on in a boat 2) Brook trout fishing waters in Southern Ontario streams. 3) Fishing for Lake O salmon/trout...either downrigging, using torpedo divers or dipseys. 4) Venturing to the Blue Zone 5) Fishing the nuke plant outflow in the dead of winter 6) Steelhead fishing some of the bigger Lake Huron tibutaries."

For myself, I'd love to do some back lake speckle fishing, well I've done that before but would love to do it again. Gar fishing, never caught one of those. Monster catfish down in Dunnville, Crossed off many since I've been on the board."
634084,cuzza,2011-10-25 18:40:00,467,From your avatar it looks like you're doing OK for a newbie!  My list would be....  1) Gar on the fly 2) Stalking carp on the Erie 'flats' 3) Steelheading on the Niagara 4) Finally getting round to trying ice fishing

Aside from that, I think I'd like to do a bunch of stuff Robson Green does in his show. Marlin fishing, catching trout in the Grand Canyon, etc.  As for nearby, I wish I could remember the places my dad took me as a kid, because I remember us catching trout, and I'd like to revisit wherever that was. And then there's my plans to try actual brooks and creeks for brookies next year."

I had a few days on Lake O this year that were high double digits but all shaker size  I really want one of those stupid fish days again on either Erie, Niagara or Quinte.
