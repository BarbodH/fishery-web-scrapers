631467,lookinforwalleye,2011-10-16 22:04:00,4399,"Arrived late, Caught no fish Fell in the river face first!!!  All kidding aside all of the above is true but I still had a great time met a great bunch of new friends from the Nottawasaga Steelheaders organization!  It was painfully obvious that equippment and knowledge wise I was way over my head with this type of fishing but even after the soaking I toughed it out!  I am already arranging more trips to the river I can see this type of fishing becoming very addictive!  Note to self purchase water wings before next trip!!!"
631473,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-10-16 22:42:00,1107,Careful it is very addictive
631478,J-M,2011-10-16 22:59:00,65," The Nottawasaga Steelheaders are a great organization and a awesome group of guys who are willing to help out newbies. Its a great way to start if you're getting into steelheading and they do alot of awesome river work. Sorry to hear about your unlucky experience, it happens! I found the Nottawasaga a tough river to fish but once you figure it out, it can be very addicting...."

631481,Victor,2011-10-16 23:08:00,1609,If so... next trip's gotta be way better   no way you can top today's performance
631486,dhickey,2011-10-16 23:32:00,1038,A lot of cool spots to fish rivers around there once you put in the time and $ the people are very nice as well spent most of my life doodling and living up there cant wait to get out of Toronto and back.  Saltydawg.

631504,Musky or Specks,2011-10-17 00:57:00,2710,Did you fish with either of the Chris W's or with Fred? Good guys whose knowledge of that system is fantastic.

631531,Twocoda,2011-10-17 02:33:00,4130,"thats your initiation to addiction....good on ya for toughing it out....i would be lying if i said it never happened to me before...my funniest was when i slipped into one of the gourges at Ben Miller and my waders filled up with my feet hanging over the falls .....just before i went over a gentlemen slammed his  salmon net over my head and saved me....then he said with his broken english "" i dunt knew if i shud keeeep you.......or pooot you back"""

631576,ccmtcanada,2011-10-17 10:45:00,7971,"Lookinforwalleye - wow!  A memorable first outing for sure!!!  I was steelheading alone once...was making my way through some frog water when I hit a bunch of logs and branches in the water.  I was trying to get around the obstacle...one foot forward...test the water.  I was in maybe 2 feet of water...took a test step...felt good and the branch breaks...water up and over my chest waders! Lol.  Glad to hear you still had a great time out there!!!  Will be even better when you hook your first...you will be hooked on it for sure!  Twocoda - that was hilarious!!!  A little scary at the time I'm sure, but glad to hear you were netted before going over the falls!"
631580,lookinforwalleye,2011-10-17 11:18:00,4399," There was a Chris there. An older gentlemen very nice guy, I actually met him earlier in the year when my buddy had him up to his trailer for a little bass fishing.  Met about a dozen guys from the organization and they take their steelheading pretty serious but they were also very willing to help out a newbie which is great, I already have a couple of offers to fish with them again. I just wish I had more time this fall.  Anybody wanna buy a bass boat!"
637094,lookinforwalleye,2011-11-03 18:29:00,4399,"Gonna try this steelheading thing again this weekend, heading up Huron way to meet up with some of the Notty guys. I hope the outcome is better than my first attempt!!!"
637096,I'mHooked,2011-11-03 18:38:00,525,Good luck!  At least I didn't fall in yesterdy.  You'll get into them this time!
637105,lookinforwalleye,2011-11-03 19:05:00,4399,"  We`ll see how it goes,I`m gonna slap some training wheels on my waders and have my pals wheel me down to the river and tie me to a tree!"
