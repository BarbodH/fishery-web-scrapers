636823,manitoubass2,2011-11-02 14:55:00,11391," lol, possibly? My son caught it last summer and my response was ""what the hell?"". A few times a year I take the kids to sucker fish in the rapids, its kinda fun, they put up a great fight and there easy for the kids to catch. But I never seen a sucker colored like this.  Earlier this year, while shore fishing, I had a fish follow me on the shoreline. I assumed it was a sucker? But it was black, and seemed to have pink lips/eyes like lack of pigment in those areas. It was very odd looking. Now in retrospect I wish I had gotten a pic to try and figure out what it was"

Here are a pile of photos from the Credit River.  Fish of the Credit Photo Gallery  While many were not caught angling, they are a pretty good snapshot of many species that anglers don't see regularly, as well as few that most people will recognize.  Jon"
636854,Roy,2011-11-02 16:50:00,13728,Great pictures Jon. Thanks for sharing them.
636860,Rod Caster,2011-11-02 17:19:00,5784, Great photos!  Mine is definitly not a fallfish...the head is quite different and the colors don't match up. Add the bumps on it's head and most likely it's either a huge common shiner or a huge horny head chub... a record maybe?
636868,Spiel,2011-11-02 17:38:00,9065, I agree with those that said fallfish
636869,Roy,2011-11-02 17:56:00,13728,"I go with fallfish as well. Don't be putting too much weight in the tubercule characteristic. Many male minnows, aside from donning bright spawning colours, develop those tubercules on theirs heads. They help keep the female in place during spawning."
636870,Jon,2011-11-02 17:56:00,209,"Fallfish also get bumps on their heads, known as nuptial tubercles. And although I use colour a lot in my id's, it is not a good id characteristic. Given the location, I'm pretty confident in the Fallfish id. I will send this link to some experts and see what they say.  Jon"
636873,Rod Caster,2011-11-02 18:12:00,5784,"  Thanks Jon, I'm curious about this now. I'll keep my bet on a chub or shiner or sorts since the head shape also seems quite different, almost turtle-like on mine."
636874,Spiel,2011-11-02 18:19:00,9065,The link I posted has an image of a male Fallfish at spawning time.

636880,Jon,2011-11-02 18:50:00,209,"Not that I'm gloating, but the Assistant Curator of Fishes at the Royal Ontario Museum agreed that is a Fallfish.  Keep the uncommon photos coming! It is a nice break from photo after photo of Rainbow Trout, Muskie or Smallies. I really liked the Longnose Sucker in full spawning colour. I've only seen a couple over the years and they both were a drab brown.  Jon"
636881,Spiel,2011-11-02 18:53:00,9065, Those Longnose Suckers in all their spawning glory (just for you Bruce   ) are quite common and also annoying at times on G'Bay tribs in the spring.
636888,Rod Caster,2011-11-02 19:36:00,5784," To me the heads still look different... maybe because it's a northern specimen. I'll side with The Curator however, he knows much more than I.  Thanks for the info!"
636890,Rod Caster,2011-11-02 19:46:00,5784,"    I thought it would be good to see them side by side. They look so different, yet, so the same."
636891,mike rousseau,2011-11-02 19:47:00,4661,well...these 2 arent lesser known species but interesting to me...  first is a brown trout i caught in the st.lawrence river... a task that not many have done...    the second is a 2 tone carp wich is my PB at 36lb12oz... ive caught hundreds and hundreds of carp and only saw this once... kinda cool that its my PB... what are the odds of that...

636678,Rod Caster,2011-11-01 23:47:00,5784,"I thought it would be interesting to see a collection of photos and descriptions of the ""lesser known species"" caught by members, like coarsefish or non-targetted species. Some of the underdog species in Ontario make for good sport fish and suprisingly good table fare.  This year I caught a couple large chub from the Ottawa River while I was fishing for walleye. My brother and I tried eating one but it was terrible pan-fried.  This one in the photo is a ""horny head chub"". It has a couple dozen little bumps on it's head and is usually much smaller. A lot of times they are found in small creeks, especially roadside it seems. They are not a delicacy for people however they make for effective and durable lake trout/pike bait.    This here is a ling (Edit:Burbot) from Lake Nipissing. I only ever catch them ice fishing for walleye using minnows or spoons. They are aggressive and big and slimy and taste great! Poor man's lobster as they call it, filets nicely into firm white strips of meat. Apparently, the people on Simcoe catch HUGE ones.    Here is a herring. It's often mistaken for a whitefish and as far as I know, tastes pretty good. I'm yet to try a full meal of it and I've heard both good and bad about the taste of the meat.    The white bass is delicious. I can't wait to catch a few more in the spring in the rivers. These were caught on a jig and minnow.    Here is a Mooneye caught in the Ottawa River by JoeyTier. I've never eaten Mooneye but I have tried Goldeye, which is essentially the same fish but the Goldeye is typically found west of Ontario. Joey caught this guy on a spoon (I think) but fly fishing is the best way to catch mooneye/goldeye.  "
636679,Fisherman,2011-11-01 23:51:00,7201,"The ling are great when boiled in salt water, drained and dipped in garlic butter.  Herring are very good smoked."

Everyone always seems to reneage when they go to eat one!!LOL   Imagine floating a mooneye under a big float for skies, they even make me hungry!!"
636691,Cookslav,2011-11-02 00:29:00,1457,"The first one looks like a fall fish to me? If its a horn head she's the biggest I've ever seen.  Could be wrong, just say'n"
636695,Rod Caster,2011-11-02 00:45:00,5784,I did a close up on another photo... there are some bumps on it's head but I'm not 100% that it's a horny head. The second photo is a photo off the internet of a fallfish. They dont look the same to me.

They're a summer species (they hide in the mud at the bottom of the lake in winter and pretty much hibernate), but they put up a great fight for their size and are very slimy! I think they're a member of the carp family and I wouldn't try and eat one.    That albino sucker looks like a sucker/koi hybrid!"
