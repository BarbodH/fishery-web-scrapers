637444,dsn,2011-11-04 18:51:00,1018,"What is this thing? I saw it hiding behind my sponge filter 60. I never exspected seeing something like this in my tank . All I have in the tank is lots of aquatic plants and 4 cardinals and 4 harliquin ras, 2 otto cats.  It must have grew up in there cause I never noticed it at all.      Here's another pic.    It was really strange. Cause when I saw the thing it moved behind the sponge filter as if noticed I seen it. The really creepy part was after I removed it and put it in the glass tube. I looked at the sponge filter again and saw another one move in and take the exact place where the first bugger was.  Can it a dragon fly larva? If it doesn't harm my cardinals or any other fish it can stay. Also if it does tranform and become a land dwelling creature.  Any ideas?  I tried searching online but did find exactly what I was looking for.  Its about an inch long.     Thanks for you help.  karper"

637450,Spiel,2011-11-04 19:16:00,9065,Damselfly Nymph.  Perhaps the live eggs came in on one of your aquatic plants.  Harmless by all means. I'm surprised your fish haven't eaten it.
637451,tonyb,2011-11-04 19:17:00,1637,I'd say Damselfly Larvae
637452,adolson,2011-11-04 19:23:00,783,"Hmm, I don't have much experience with this, but to me it looks like trout bait."
637454,HTHM,2011-11-04 19:37:00,4082,  As Sheldon would say....Bazinga!
637456,Fishnwire,2011-11-04 19:44:00,983,"No idea what that is.  One time I had a bucket of gravel sitting in my basement for well over a year.  Then I used it in a new tank I set up and when I did I noticed a live snail in there.  Another time my buddy had a 90 gallon with about a half dozen large Africans.  One day he notices a new fish, about two inches long, that he didn't put in there.  Two adults must have thrown a clutch of eggs, and one hatched and managed to hide and to eat and not get eaten long enough to grow too big to be preyed upon.  Weird stuff happens in fish tanks.  It's cool when it does.  Thanks for sharing."
637459,adolson,2011-11-04 19:46:00,783," No bazinga, he knew what I meant - effective baits for trout!"
637460,cjgraham,2011-11-04 19:47:00,104,Def Damsel Fly Larva three tails is a dead give away. Harmless...free fish food! Here is a pic I pulled off the net. 
637468,adolson,2011-11-04 20:03:00,783," Newcastle? Where is that? Why don't you come north, it's colder up here, so I trust the ice more. Plus I am lonely and could use some friends."
637470,Spiel,2011-11-04 20:08:00,9065,"  Many Mayfly Nymphs have three tails as well.   But I do agree, definitely a Damselfly Nymph."
637491,aplumma,2011-11-04 21:16:00,6896,I would think that your local aquarium shop had a hitchhiker on the plant as well.   Art
637496,GBW,2011-11-04 21:51:00,8460,"ya, lazy bugger...  no way, it's colder! we'll see ,get your hut, heater and keep that snowmobile to pull us around and maybe, just maybe..."
637542,Dozer,2011-11-05 00:31:00,896,"If you have aquatic plants, they certainly carry hitch hikers.  Used to work at a pond shop in Toronto ( Clarke Koi Ponds ) and when we'd get our floating plants from the southern states, kept them in a greenhouse. Over the summer we'd have exotic dragon flies and damsels flying around from time to time.  And looks like killer trout bait!"
637599,Photoz,2011-11-05 11:04:00,792,Another good reason for not dumping your fish tank or minnow bucket near ANY body of local water . . . .    amazing just how hardy these possibly invasive creatures can be!
