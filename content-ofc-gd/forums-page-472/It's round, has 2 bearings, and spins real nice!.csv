637092,I'mHooked,2011-11-03 18:17:00,525,"Ok everyone, thanks for the feedback and encouragement on the new gear.  Now to direct your attention to the 1st fishing report with said gear!  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=58202  Sure did enjoy the new rod and reel!"
634979,I'mHooked,2011-10-27 22:31:00,525,"Wohoo! Finally took the next big step in my fishing addiction...bought new gear!  Some may think that after my rather successful 1st time Musky fishing 2 weeks ago, I'd be loading up with some Musky gear. (for those that missed it: http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=57904 )  I'm sure John may even be a little disappointed it's not a new St.Croix Legend Tournament Musky rod, but hey, there are other worthy species out there as well. That's where today comes in.  Been getting frustrated the last few years trying to drift on fast moving water with a frozen spinning reel, so here's the new toy:    Was looking at the Sheffield as well as some of the Ravens, but settled on the new Okuma Raw-II.  Looks reel nice (at least I think anyhow), and seems to spin forever.  Now, I'm still only paired with a 10½ foot Pflueger Trion HM45 Graphite light action rod, but it's been serving a purpose the last few years, and it's going to get me broken in on the new 'pin'  I'll just have to figure out how to sneak a 13½ footer through the front door one of these days!  Anyone else used this reel yet? Love to hear how it handles.  Now just have to figure out how to use the damn thing!"
634984,lew,2011-10-27 22:37:00,12766,"I've never tried that style of fishing, but I must admit, that is one snazzy looking fish'n reel !!"
634985,misfish,2011-10-27 22:37:00,29133,"Guess who got the first one? LOL  It is a sweet reel.  I did take it out of the box and give it a spin,and yes,it spun for ever. Im waiting for the right match up for it. It should be arriving late spring."
634997,Raf,2011-10-27 23:04:00,3495,help edumacate me:  why is the fact that it spins forever or easily so important for float reels?
635000,danjang,2011-10-27 23:09:00,148, The longer it spins would mean that it has very little friction which in turn would mean that it would have very little start up inertia. This allows for the float to drift down without resistance leading to a more natural presentation. Or something along those lines .
635001,Roy,2011-10-27 23:11:00,13728," It holds their attention, Raf. In marketing circles it's called the Fisher-Price feature."
635004,Roy,2011-10-27 23:13:00,13728,"OOPS, and congrats on the reel."
635025,Ralph Field,2011-10-28 00:08:00,1018,"I held this reel in a tackle store and for the money I think you made a wise choice. The start up of a CP is the most important feature , but the Raw ll does have both ,which isn't always the case. I think you will be happy with your purchase and that you will be impressed with pinning after you give it a try."
635042,BillM,2011-10-28 00:41:00,17367,Sweet reel!  Definitely some bling bling going on.
635058,cowanjo,2011-10-28 01:14:00,249,Im Hooked Im Shocked ... how can someone looking like this buy anything but a winch and a sling blade? Explain in a post with all your musky!!! 
635095,rocheleauc,2011-10-28 03:03:00,205,nice pin! looks good
635120,bare foot wader,2011-10-28 05:06:00,1354,"flashy reel, i've been trying to find one but mainly a rawII 80, no luck, all pre-sold out...did you order online? mind sending a pm where you picked it up?  enjoy the new gear, good luck"
635222,I'mHooked,2011-10-28 15:27:00,525,"         Going to try and hit a rather large, high flowing river in the next week or so.  Do you guys agree with 50 yards of 20# for backing under 8# main line?"
635226,BillM,2011-10-28 15:33:00,17367,You could use way more then 50 yards of backing depending on how deep the spool is...  Alot of guys use Dacron as well.
635236,adolson,2011-10-28 16:03:00,783,I want that and I have no clue about how to use it. It just looks like something I need.
635242,Harrison,2011-10-28 16:20:00,2202," You did sir. First one in Canada anyways.  Guess which handsome devil kept the 2nd?  I have more coming in soon, can reserve one if anyone wants.  They sold out fast.  Can pre-order the Raw II spinning reels as well. http://www.etackle.ca/new-okuma-raw-ii-float-reel-1002/"
635311,Ralph Field,2011-10-28 17:59:00,1018,"I would go with 100 yards of dacron backing and then fill it up with mono,I prefer 10 lb for my mainline.The test of your mainline should be at least 4 lb. heavier than your leader (5or 6lb.). Do the fish a favour and never ever use 2 lb. test unless you intend to keep all your fish. Any fish even after careful reviving will die due to the build up of lactic acid in their system after a couple of days if they were fought to exhaustion on 2 lb. test.Rant over."
635369,DOS,2011-10-28 20:25:00,119,"Just went into a panic, I have had 5 on order for the store for quite some time now, just gave the supplier a call wondering where mine are, but they still have not received the shipment.  5 coming in, one is for me"
635497,chefboi17,2011-10-29 05:59:00,128,"These seem to be sold out almost everywhere, etackle, and mark ham lebaron both sold out within the fist few days they had them"
635774,Paulus,2011-10-30 04:14:00,522, hehehe I like you. I love your status moniker too. Fat guy in a little boat.
635776,Paulus,2011-10-30 04:17:00,522," If you're going to use it, then it's worth it. Sell the 10 1/2 to someone who is just starting out, and get yourself a 13 or 13.5 - you won't regret it.  p.-"
636542,Harrison,2011-11-01 14:08:00,2202,Just got my new order of Okuma Raw II Float Reels in!  In Stock for those who maybe interested in this amazing reel.  http://www.etackle.ca/new-okuma-raw-ii-float-reel-1002/
636597,I'mHooked,2011-11-01 17:26:00,525,Decided to bite the bullet and go for broke.  Picked up a 13' St. Croix Avid (AVS130MLM2) Steelhead rod to pair with the new reel. Out in the back yard trying to figure how to use the damn thing...good thing no body was watching!
636635,misfish,2011-11-01 20:23:00,29133,"  Oh I know.  I was trying to spin the reel as I casted it. Didnt work so well.  Thank goodness, to a helpful fellow angler."
636875,davey buoy,2011-11-02 18:31:00,5505,I'm hooked as well as Brian:thumbsup_anim: you'll love it and if your at the river different times like we were some one will give you some advice and after that away you go. Don't be afraid to ask as well.
