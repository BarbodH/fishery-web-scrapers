Was going to try deep diving baits along the trough in South Bay? got some new Live Target perch colored baits that look pretty sexy. Just wondering if any of you have fished balsam recently and are finding the ski's deep yet? Want to know whether to target shallower in 8-12 fow or 15-20 fow.  Also what baits/ presentations are best for this time of year? Was going to slow troll around 2mph till I find some bait fish/ a hookup and then try casting? Do you guys find bucktail spinners are still producing this time of year Or should I stick with jerkbaits over top of weeds?  Appreciate the help!!  Rob"

637203,Rich Nelson,2011-11-03 23:00:00,332,"Id start with some bigger baits than the live target perch... Jakes, believers etc. Experiment with color and start by trolling deeper structure. If u arent getting bit then try big jerkbaits on weededges... Let us know how u do. Good luck"

Dax is bang on, dont be afraid to look deep, and occasionally make bottom contact banging over deep water humps etc hopefully you have a GPS to help you put together a trolling pattern, with track lines you can follow back on if you contact fish   good luck  "
