636530,lew,2011-11-01 13:21:00,12766,"I've had a moustache for 40 years, if I was to shave it off my daughter wouldn't know me and my wife would wonder who the heck was sitting across from her at supper time"
636591,brandon,2011-11-01 17:03:00,857,"I'm also participating this year however I had to cheat and pre-grew mine all october.  I have a wedding to shoot this coming saturday and a 5 day old moustache will not help my professional image at all, so this was my only option. http://mobro.co/brandonbroderick   Movember by bbroderick86, on Flickr"

637053,grt1,2011-11-03 14:42:00,638,"I used to have a stach for years, shaved it off one day and everyone told me it made me look younger. So I kept it off but since my dentures no longer fit and i'm gumming it until i get the nerve up to by another set (and potentially waste another $2000)I think i'll give the movember thing a try and see what it looks like again (too bad it's going to be grey)"
