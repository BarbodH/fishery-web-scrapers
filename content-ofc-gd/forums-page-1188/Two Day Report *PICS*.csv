Weather co-operated and most teams brought in a limit.  We had 13.10, good enough for 4th place.  The Kawarthas are not my style of fishery, I prefer DEEP water, however, we made do.   4 of our 5   Jeno and Tommy with their big fish.   Today, Kelli and I got out onto G-Bay for some smallie fishing.  We dropshotted gobies, and fished flukes around shoals, we ended up with 6 fish in 4 hours.  Pretty slow today, but not bad overall.        "
