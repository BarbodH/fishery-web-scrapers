Every place I have looked at, including sponsers from this board, will not rent for only 2 days(sat, sun night).  Does anyone know a cheap place I can stay at for a couple of nights? I'm coming with another 3 people(a guy and 2 girls). I was thinking of staying at a local hotel but will my boat be safe???  If worse comes to worse, we may camp or choose another destination."
88228,Gerritt,2007-06-27 01:14:00,6129,I know it is not Callander but Lakair offers camping sites on the West Arm.... right beside HWY 64.... worth a mention..   Gerritt.
88235,solopaddler,2007-06-27 01:27:00,8605,"Any other season besides summer it's no problem getting a cottage for 2 nights up there. Summer as you've already noticed, they all want a 7 day minimum.... If it was me I'd get on the phone and call every single camp that interested me directly. While they might say they have a 7 day minimum on their website it's pretty doubtful any of them would turn down the business if they have an open slot. Never know 'till you try. Beyond that I've stayed at this place a bunch of times for ice fishing. It may not be your cup of tea, but it is a place to stay and right across from the government docks in Callander...  http://www.innonthebay.ca/  cheers,  Mike"
88236,Clampet,2007-06-27 01:28:00,1947,"Sorry, I couldn't resist..   What ever you do don't stay here ( memories of The bates Motel)..   These locations are on the North Shore of Lake Nipissing. "
