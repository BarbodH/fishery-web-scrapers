(yeah, like our family needs an excuse...LOL).  Anyhow, our oldest brought a friend along...she had only fished once before in her life.  We arrived early afternoon to a local conservation area to see what we could pull out today.  Not a lot of fish were caught, but everyone had a great time!!  Here are some pictures of the afternoon....  My daughter's friend was the first to catch a fish!!   Here's a pic of one of our oldest daughter's fish.....   Of course, no fishing trip is complete without our little one playing with the worms....talking to them etc....LOL   A cool pic of a little frog....   A nice little sunny...she's got the pose down perfectly!!!   And the big fish of the afternoon, a 12 inch bass...kind of a nice surprise, since the pond is so little.   That's it for now....stay tuned for CCMT's report of our evening fishing....."
