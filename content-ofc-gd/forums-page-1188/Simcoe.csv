89448,misfish,2007-06-29 19:17:00,29133,Crates Marine. Work the whole area. If you have a trolling motor work your way around the boats.They are pretty friendly there as long as you dont bang the lures off thier boats.They like the entertainment of a fish being caught.
89496,HUKDONFAWNIX,2007-06-29 20:57:00,135,Thanks Misfish!  I appreciate it.  Does anyone else have any suggestions?
89511,007,2007-06-29 21:59:00,537,Anywhere in the weed off Gilford.  Two weeks ago I hooked a beauty about 100m from shore in 8ft of water.  Only problem was my line snapped and I lost it.  If you catch or see one with a 'hot steel' coloured xrap in its mouth that's the one! I want that lure back LOL  Good luck 007
