89732,SlowPoke,2007-06-30 23:42:00,2984,No pictures? Then it never happened Good report and good info. I got to test my 50kHz transducer today... loving it! Saw the balls but didn't see the t-cline. What sensitivity are you running for your 50kHz?  P.S. Bly is hot on the kings now... hope she leaves some bigguns for the derby! -Brian
