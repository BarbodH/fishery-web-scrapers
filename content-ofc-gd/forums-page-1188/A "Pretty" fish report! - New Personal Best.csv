89490,mattyk,2007-06-29 20:42:00,2110,"great fish, you guys need your own fishing show!"
89502,fishnsled,2007-06-29 21:10:00,3520,Well isn't that a nice surprise!  Great looking fish!
89504,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-29 21:31:00,0,Nice! Browns are beautiful fish and decent fighters. I always enjoy landing surprise catches! Good Job!
89508,007,2007-06-29 21:54:00,537,"Have you two ever considered setting yourself the same target that I have of catching as many different species in a year as possible. I'm convinced you could just do it and catch all of them in Ontario!  My guess is you already have more than me already, and usually bigger than the ones I get too!!     Seriously...How many/what species have you caught this year between the two of you, i'm curious?  Watch out fish... here comes ccmtcanada and bly - none of you are safe!  Keep the reports coming.  All the best for the weekend. 007"
89514,motv8tr,2007-06-29 22:23:00,2587,That's great Carol    Congrats on the new PB... The comparison shot of what that one trout was eating and your lure was great...don't think I've seen one that good before.  Thanks for sharing  Maureen
89521,Bly,2007-06-29 22:52:00,1556,"Thanks everyone!   They really were a nice surprise   The Red Devil is one lure I think I will always make sure I have in my tackle...it has been very very good to me lol    Thank you also for the information on the North winds....will have to remember that!  007...Here is a list of the species that we have caught this year.... Musky Pike Rock Bass LM Bass SM Bass Perch Bluegill Pumpkinseed Trout Perch Rainbow Trout Brown Trout Creek Chub Bullhead Carp Goby white sucker lake herring alewive (snagged)  I think that is all of them for this year, all species except the musky have been caught from shore.  Oh and some of them were quite small  lol  Good luck with your quest....I think it is great and I love reading the updates!"
89559,007,2007-06-30 02:11:00,537,Judging by that list - I think your beating me by three or four species! I must try harder! LOL  I don't suppose you have a picture of the Trout-perch? I've seen drawings of them in a book but never an actual photo of one - would be great to see a shot of an uncommon species like that. (sorry for changing the subject from your initial post)  007
89561,highdrifter,2007-06-30 02:37:00,2534,Very noice!  The red devil... Is there anything it can't do?  Definetly a go-to spoon when the winds are high and the alewife are pushed into shore..  Thanks for sharing.  HD
89564,ccmtcanada,2007-06-30 02:44:00,7971, Here's that picture...it's not very clear...but the markings look pretty clear on it...   Oh yeah...I have to add Sheepshead to that list of species for this year!  I have another report up...
89571,crappiesteve,2007-06-30 03:13:00,220,"Wow nice looking Browns Bly,was Cliff the net boy  WTG.  Steve"
89615,Jigger,2007-06-30 13:11:00,1237,"Very purdy fish! Nice to see you guys keep on being successful, no matter what species it is!Congrats."
89620,Shelley Cooper,2007-06-30 13:58:00,394,Very Nice Bly.... WTG....  excellent pictures... thanks for sharing...
89634,Carmen,2007-06-30 15:57:00,72,"Nice couple of fish, always a bonus when you hook into something younever expected"
89719,fishindevil,2007-06-30 23:04:00,6254,"Great catch carol!!!!!!...thats a very nice football sized brown,they both look like they have been eating well,great report   cheers"
89116,Bly,2007-06-29 03:23:00,1556,"Well, CCMT and I decided to head out tonight despite the cold front that passed through over night.  We brought the Carp gear, but also our smaller rods to see if anything else was swimming around before it got dark out.  We arrived at our spot at around 840pm...the winds were a blowin' and it was a little bit chilly out.  CCMT started throwing his Jumla's he got at Lakair and I took out my lucky Red Devil stand by lure.  Well, wouldn't you know it...a few minutes of casting and something hits my spoon!  I tell CCMT ""Fish On"" and he goes to get the net.  Suddenly, this fish starts jumping out of the water and is putting up a great fight!  I wasn't sure exactly what it was until he netted it.  Here's the nice surprise...a 20.5 inch Brown Trout!!!   I moved to a different spot, and while CCMT was putting a Red Devil on his line, I had another fish on!!!  There is usually Pike cruising along this area and I just finished telling CCMT that Pike dont like me....LOL.  Again, I landed a nice 18 inch Brown!  As I was unhooking it, it's dinner popped out of his mouth.  If you look at the picture, you'll see it's the same size and shape as the spoon I was throwing.   So, at the end of the night, those were the only 2 fish caught.  It flew directly in the face of what we know about trout fishing...you know...ultralight florocarbon leaders, small hooks, etc.  These were caught with 15 pound power pro and a big spoon!!"
89118,jediangler,2007-06-29 03:31:00,1923,Nice fish. Isn't it strange for browns to be within casting distance of shore this time of year? Maybe I'll have to take a trip down to Lake O with my kayak and fish some tribs.
89119,ccmtcanada,2007-06-29 03:32:00,7971," We thought the same thing...but then again, what do we know?? LOL.  Apparently these fish may have been a little confused!"
89122,Nanook,2007-06-29 03:33:00,565," So, you've done it again, Bly.  Nice coupla Trout.  Y'know, if you two fell into a sewer, you would smell like roses !!!"
89124,snag,2007-06-29 03:34:00,1932,That's so cool!  Love the comparison shot!  Way to go C.!!!
89126,ecxstriper,2007-06-29 03:38:00,343,Here we go CCmt and bly will be posting browns now
89128,wolfville,2007-06-29 03:43:00,396,"  I believe, if they fell into a sewer, they'll come out with two channel cat. They are just amazing and I am glad I stayed up again for this post ;-)"
89130,Sinker,2007-06-29 03:47:00,8692,"That's a nice bonus!! Beautiful fish!  When we get a good north wind, it blows the warm water out, and brings the cold water in.....that could be why the browns were in closer to shore. I've caught them all summer long where I think your fishing........try a silver and blue cleo sometime, you might be surprised at what you can catch there. I haven't fished down there for years, but I've  had some good luck, and been the only one there many times. Maybe I should try it down there again.......  Sinker"
89134,Dutch,2007-06-29 03:52:00,831,Great job Bly
89147,Golfisher,2007-06-29 04:33:00,586,That's gotta be a nice surprise!
89148,Hooked,2007-06-29 04:41:00,891,"Ok guys, now I've seen it all!  Haha, you guys kill me.  Noddin head.  I think if it swims, be afraid, be very afraid of the bly and ccmt connection.  Nice going.  Remember the wind direction for future catches.  I recall Speil telling me how important that is for trout and salmon, even in the summer cuz it'll bring em in.  You two rock!  Keep it up!"
89150,Mike the Pike,2007-06-29 05:10:00,3421,Speechless  MTP
89153,nautifish,2007-06-29 05:26:00,1416,very very nice bly WTG GRL!
89178,solopaddler,2007-06-29 10:35:00,8605,"Wow, that is very cool, congrat's! It's not overly suprising though....especially considering they were browns. They'll make many forays inshore to feed even in the height of summer, moreso than other trout or salmon. If you look at the current water temps. here http://www.coastwatch.msu.edu/ontario/o.html you'll see that the inshore waters were quite cool. If you keep close tabs on the temps. you can almost predict when you'll have action. Anything below 40 degrees is absolutely prime. Sometimes in the summer if the winds are condusive a temp. inversion will occur and you'll have a legitimate crack at some big chrome kings off the piers in July.  cheers,  Mike"
89188,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-29 11:25:00,2585,lovely colours on those fish!!!!  Cheers!

89267,SlowPoke,2007-06-29 14:24:00,2984,Another great outing Bly... may your next fish be a Sturgeon on a top-water! -Brian
89375,Mike Pike,2007-06-29 16:55:00,1332,"Congratz on the beauty Browns guys!  They look like they really had the feed bags strapped on, eh?  Nice when you're at the right place at the right time.  Thanks for posting!"
89378,Bernie,2007-06-29 16:59:00,3190,You two are amazing fisherpeople!!!!! WTG
89465,camillj,2007-06-29 19:40:00,1988,Darn .. the secret is out !!! Nice catch !  Nice catch ... seriously though ... yep the browns are out off the eastern tribs right now ... and getting ready for their run ... I have caught them in the tribs in late July (most ppl dont realize how early they actually run).   I have spent MANY a mid August afternoon completely on my own nn the tribs with NICE runs of L.O. browns.
89470,rickster,2007-06-29 19:45:00,495,dandy fish  congrats
