89662,Beans,2007-06-30 19:25:00,3339,"Iv'e been wanting to try the ''Sabiki Rig"" Glen gave me at Lakair and today was the day...Boy do the rockbass ever like it !!!  I hope Herb approves as it seems that is all the fish gods were providing with one exception...I switched to a tube jig and caught a very lucky smallmouth...any bigger than it was it would have been kept for cleaning...  Herb never kept bass so I dedicated the smallie to Lew's brother EddyK...  Then the rains came...end of story."
