89427,Anatz,2007-06-29 18:48:00,74,"Our trip to Rice Lake started @ 5pm on the 401 East heading towards a drivers worst scenario of highway traffic. I'm not to sure what happened on the 401 but we decided to take a detour through some quiet roads and eventually made it to the lake around 7:30, which usually takes us 1hr and half. We arrived at Rice Lake near the Chip stop and my brother and I immediately casted our lines from the public port...and I caught my first bass ever within 10 minutes using a tube bait with a Texas rig. I can't really tell how big the bass was but it was pretty nice. After having no luck with no fish bitting for about 1 hr, we decided to head off to the public docking area at the park. My brother casted out his Booyah Spinner Bait and had Fish on with a nice fat bass..that bad boy gave him a nice fight and eventually gave in. After an hour we called it a day. The weather condition was also rough..there was a lot of wind and the water seems to be very choppy and the moon wasn't out..so I'm assuming these conditions are not the condition to be fishing at. Other than that I had a great time..especially catching my first bass  for the first time and the first of the season.  I have so much more to learn about fishing and I'm looking forward to it all summer"
