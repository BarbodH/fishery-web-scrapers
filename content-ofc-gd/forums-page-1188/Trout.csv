River fishing is my favorite way to fish, but I am not having much luck this year lol....the trout are hard to find in summer.  Plus i cant drive yet so I cant go anywhere too far lol.  If anyone has any advice on where to fish this time of year that would be great, and I look forward to many great conversations on this forum.  Thanks, Mike"

If you can get to headwaters in surrounding towns, you can catch some small-ish brookies and the occasional brown.  Better trout fishing is at least 30 minutes away (driving) from where I am in Richmond Hill, perhaps more or less depending on where you are."
