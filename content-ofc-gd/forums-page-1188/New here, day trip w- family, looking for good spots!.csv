We were wondering if you guys can suggest a good shoreline area (we have no boat & don't wanna spend the money to rent one)  were we could fish nearby, maybe on lake simcoe or even right around wasaga.  We don't really need BIG GAME fish but would be nice to land some largemouths or smallies.  thanks."
