89684,danbouck,2007-06-30 21:07:00,4380,Went out for the morning on the river for some smallmouth. Found that it was extremely shallow and there wasn't too many bass. Only caught about a dozen or so with only a couple nice ones. Mostly the usual 8-10 inchers. It was a nice day to be floating down though.   This is one of the usual small ones   I decided to bring home a couple of the nice ones   It wasn't nearly as fun as last weekend when we went out but still a nice morning.
