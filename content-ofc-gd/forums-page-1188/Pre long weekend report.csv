Turned out to be bass for the most part, at least whenever we could get the sunfish to stop attacking whatever we put in the water (including things much larger than they were).  First stop was a walleye hole and it wasn't long til the first few fish were int the boat  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1204/665509543_da0f5238d3.jpg"" width=""375"" height=""500"" alt=""IMG_0787"" /></a>  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1087/665512031_005f948126.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_0788"" /></a>  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1246/665519893_8f10cde87f.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_0793"" /></a>  Doh.  We hung around there for another 10 minutes but the little guys wouldn't let a jig hit bottom so we decided to skip the walleye hunting for now and move over to where I'd seen some smallies last time I was up here.  After reading Stoty's report last week we had both gone out and picked up some Chug Bug topwaters so Mike tosses one out while I'm still trying to find the elusive walleye.  ""Lures gone"" he says on the first cast. ""Yeah right"" I say and turn around just in time to see this little guy rocket a good 3 feet into the air.  What a rush topwater is.  Wasn't big but hey, its not a sunfish  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1371/665515045_979a48802e_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_0789"" /></a>  We stayed there a bit longer but couldn't seem to entice any more in so we moved along to the next spot and I decided to try a deep diving jointed shad rap and was a glad I did, after another small one visited us in the boat (no pic) this guy was in the boat.  Turned out to be the biggest of the day at 3 1/2 pounds:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1423/665517565_16fe70438f_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_0791"" /></a>  Once again though we seemed to be stuck with the one fish per spot curse (we've agreed to blame it on the cold front, can't be our fishing thats for sure  ).  We then tried a couple spots I thought I remembered for the last time.  After a wasted hour or so I figured we'd better give up on my memory before Mike tossed me out of the boat for wasting time (though we did catch a hell of a lot of panfish, they're everywhere in this lake).  Later in the afternoon after failing to find some muskie trolling (if anyone finds a red believer style lure embedded in some weeds Bitsmith would like to talk to you) we headed to another bass spot and while tying on a spinnerbait I dropped my jig over the side and before it hit bottom we had our next bass:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1067/665524821_5fb232c2fa_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_0795"" /></a>  What a lunker!  Mike dropped his salamander right beside where I was and pulled up a nicer one:  <a href=""  ' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>      title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1068/665522569_9653af6b53_b.jpg""'>http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1068/665522569_9653af6b53_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_0794"" /></a>  Then we started actually casting and working the water and that damned white salamander was the go to bait.  Nothing huge to start but they were coming up almost on cue (assuming you could stop the bluegills from trying to eat this 6 inch softbait).  Most were in this size range:  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/665522569/"" title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1068/665522569_9653af6b53_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_0794"" /></a>  I managed to grab one with a PopR but then Mike's salamander came through with a nice largie:  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/665532211/"" title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1047/665532211_84c192c468_b.jpg"" width=""768"" height=""1024"" alt=""IMG_0799"" /></a>  All in all we didn't get huge numbers (if you don't count panfish) or monsters but it was a nice day of fishing and I'm really starting to like Stoney, there's a great variety of structure and fishing styles to try.  We really didn't do much muskie hunting or 'eye trolling for example and we only covered small part of the lake (1/3 maybe) in 10 hours on the water.  Still trying to get a southern ontario walleye before my thunder bay trip but I'll take a day of fun bass anytime."
