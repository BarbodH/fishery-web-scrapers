I plan on attending the OFC get-together again next year and, coming that far, I usually spend two weeks in that area.  Just before arriving at Lakair this year, I went on up to Lucky Strike for a quick look around, as I am also considering that camp for my second week next year.  I have never stayed at the camp, but it does look pretty nice there and the cabins seem to be in good shape.  They gave me a map of the area during my visit and marked a couple problem areas (rocks), which aren't that many.  Overall, the waterway appears to be clear in the main channel areas.  I'm sure the owners will fix you up with a map and point you in the right direction.   There was one member who responded to a previous post of mine indicating he caught his PB musky on the south side of musky island, just out from the camp.   They launch and pull the boat for you and they have a very nice (and large) fish cleaning hut.  I'll be interested in your report when you get back.  Let me know what you think of the place and what you think of the fishing opportunities there."
