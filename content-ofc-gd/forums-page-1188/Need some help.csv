89530,muddler,2007-06-29 23:53:00,623,"Well there is a way to download the video.  First got to   http://www.benjaminstrahs.com/ and download and install Ares Tube. Read the instructionc carefully on the webpage.  Select Zippy Videos when you launch Ares tube. In the seach box enter Fishin with family & freinds'   (NO quotes). I just copied the name of the video and then pasted it in the search box.  Maximize the Ares tube window.  Click on the video you want to download. Ares tube is still active, click on the green + sign to add this video for downloading.  In options tab at the bottom set the output folder and file type.  Click on DOWNLOAD.  When I did it id downloaded as a FLV (Flash) file. I use a free FLV palyer to play it back.  Cheers......muddler"
