Although, I think that if I can get it figured out, I'll start putting some more good fish in the boat.  My buddy Mat and I headed up to Lake Muskoka to try it out.  I lost a nice pike right off the bat on a dropshot in 19 fow, not what we're looking for.  I eventually landed one, and Mat switched to his Northam spinnerbait and started whacking them, nothing huge, but nice fish nonetheless.  Stubborn me kept working the dropshot with nothing but 20 or so 7-10 inch fish to show for it.  I'll drag a tube come tourney time, until I get the hang of this dropshot thing.  I guess this shows that finesse is not neccessarily the best way to catch em.   my only 'keeper' size fish of the day.   Mat with a nice little guy on the SPBT   A few nice ones for Mat"
