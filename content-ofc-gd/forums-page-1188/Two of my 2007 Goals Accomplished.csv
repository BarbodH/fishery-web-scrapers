88068,ccmtcanada,2007-06-26 19:03:00,7971,"At the beginning of the year, I decided that I'd try to catch 5 species as recognized by the OFAH minimum size standards.  With that, bly and I decided to try a few new types of fishing in order to attain that goal...one was float fishing for trout and the other was bottom fishing for carp.  The smallie that I caught in Nipissing's boat at Lakair this past weekend happened to be my 5th species!!  Here's a little summary of the qualifying fish....                A few other goals included catching my first Muskie (also accomplished at Lakair), and my other is landing a nice Salmon.  I figure my best opportunity for the Salmon will be the fall runs on the tribs.  Oh yeah...in looking at the current Avid Anglers on their site, I noticed that our very own pikeie also has attained this status!! Congrats pikeie!!"
88070,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-26 19:06:00,2585,right on!  All great fish!  Congrats!  Cheers!
88071,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-26 19:07:00,2585,right on!  All great fish!  Congrats!  Cheers!
88073,Whopper,2007-06-26 19:12:00,2174,Congrats Cliff!  Well for someone that just got back to fishing after a long layoff you've done well!  Whopper  PS you ever though about playing the lottery
88075,oxcowboy,2007-06-26 19:19:00,544,"great job, that list of fish is something to be real proud of.  i hope to at least get a couple in about a month when i finally get to head north.  congrats on the accomplishment.  jason"
88081,mattyk,2007-06-26 19:33:00,2110,nice work!
88088,TJQ,2007-06-26 19:42:00,7806,Thats awesome dude... mayhaps ill have to give it a shot..
88099,tonyb,2007-06-26 19:56:00,1637, Cliff...I have confidence in your abilities and I think you will catch a Salmon if you go night fishing in Late August - Mid-September at the mouth of any of the tributaries down your way casting one of these in 3/4 oz size.   Little Cleo - Flourescent Orange Glow  Go to Fortino's or any other place that develops film from the disposable cameras and ask to have one with a flash that has been stripped of the film.  This makes for a cheap flash to charge your glow lures with.
88117,motv8tr,2007-06-26 20:17:00,2587,"Hey Cliff that's great...I thought about it, but I need to go fishing more first   That's a beaury small mouth you got there...I didn't hear about that one...way to go!!!  Maureen"
88119,Victor,2007-06-26 20:19:00,1609,"congratulations Cliff, i knew it would take u no time to achieve ur goals."
88134,tbayboy,2007-06-26 21:28:00,1497,"Congrats Cliff and Pikeie.  I'm sure the Salmon will make the list once you start targeting them, might be nice to replace Rock Bass with Salmon on your 5 qualifiers (not that I have anything against rock bass - hell of a fish   )"
88137,fishindevil,2007-06-26 21:37:00,6254,"Well done cliff,now you got the real hard 5 more to get..  .lol...lol... congrats,cheers"
88142,ccmtcanada,2007-06-26 21:51:00,7971," LOL Shawn....you are right!!  The other categories are....  Largemouth Bass Muskie Walleye Salmon Whitefish  Hopefully bly and I can get into big Walleye this fall again.  The Salmon could be caught in a trib.  The largie, muskie and whitefish could be tough without a boat.....hint hint....LOL."
88150,fishergirl72,2007-06-26 22:14:00,455,Way to go Cliff!   I still have to get my first 5 and you have to get your last 5   I am happy for you.
88154,mepps,2007-06-26 22:28:00,1301,"Nicely done, I only have 2 species covered so far!"
