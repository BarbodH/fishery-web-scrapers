His place is on Drag Lake just outside of Haliburton.   Friday night was just sitting around the fire and have'n a few pops.     The next day we got going at the crack of noon. We were working over an area of submerged logs. My buddy Chris yells out ""snag"" and yanks on the rod. The drag starts to sing and I'm yelling start reel'n in, trees don't usually pull back. After a short while he lands this brute, his personal best Largemouth.    I was catching these little guy's all weekend. Can't complain though, beats getting skunked        Of course when we went out on the neighbours pontoon boat Sunday doesn't Chris hook into this nice fish. When it rains it pours LOL.     Going back tomorrow morning for a week with our wives and hoping to catch a nice Laker before we come home.  Everyone have a good weekend and be safe!  Chris."
