Does anyone know if Canadian Tire carries these?  I would assume that BPS would have them, but wanted to see if someone closer to Pickering would carry them.  Thanks for any help."
89387,misfish,2007-06-29 17:35:00,29133,"Baas pro has what you want. I need a new one as well as the timer part dosent work. CT has bilge pump timers,not the same."
89424,Stoty,2007-06-29 18:42:00,2910,"Ya, I figured they would have them, just wanted something a little closer to Pickering, thats all.  Thanks though!  Gives me an excuse to go there!!!"

I am gonna pick up a Lowrance Fishfinder/GPS combo unit! Plus a bunch of other stuff! Thank god for plastic!!!"
