89554,holdfast,2007-06-30 01:49:00,1813,If the power goes out sump is useless.  I was wondering what would be a good alternative to keep the pump kicking in .  Besides a generater would a Battery power pack be any good and for how long.  Also what wattage as a minimum.  We maybe awaiting a storm and my pump is still working from Sundays storm.   Thanks

89583,Smokey,2007-06-30 03:35:00,1278,You can buy battery back up packages at TSC stores as well as Homer Depo. A great investment if you can't always be there with a generator to monitor things. Great peace of mind. They have a trickle charger for a deep cycle battery to keep things in good shape till needed.
