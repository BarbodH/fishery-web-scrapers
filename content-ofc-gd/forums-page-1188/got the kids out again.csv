Sorry for the pic quality. we fished for three hours or so and between the two of them they must have landed twenty five and lost as many. They had a great time ""tag team"" fishing as they called it. I was trying for the carp I keep seeing but only had a couple line taps. Oh well, these trips are for them anyway. this will be one of many trips to report this summer for them.Sorry for the layout on this,still figuring my way around."
