The morning was little slow but I managed to find a really nice warm water pocket that was holding tons of pike. The surface temp in this area was ranging between 63-66 degrees and the weed growth was mint. We ended up boated 4 really nice pike, biggest was around 9lbs. All fish hit spinner baits rolling at various speeds over and around the dense weeds. With the polarized glasses on I saw tons of pike and carp and, even saw a couple catfish and one largemouth. I am off to the kawarthas on Sunday and Monday but will be back next week to start some serious Salmon fishing. here are a couple pictures of the pike trip        Have a great long weekend Cheers Al www.alsadventures.ca"
