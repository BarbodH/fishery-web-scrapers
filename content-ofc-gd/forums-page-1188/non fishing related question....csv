I am currently trying to fill out a  APPLICATION FOR TRANSPORTATION SECURITY CLEARANCE...  one of the part I need to fill out is ""Port of entry"" because I was not born in Canada.  What is this 'Port of entry' asking for ?  City I came into ?  Airport? I am not sure.  ---------------- Also, one more question regarding ""Complexion"".   What type of word? term? do I use to explain my skin color? By the way, I am asian.  --------------------------  Thank you for your help!"
89534,Motorhead,2007-06-30 00:26:00,163,I`m guessing they mean where you were when you first stepped on Canadian soil... Airport wherever??
89546,Fisherman,2007-06-30 00:57:00,7201,"Port of entry, like they said above, wherever you cleared coming through immigration, be it by ship air or land. Complexion, usually goes by fair, medium, or dark,  having assisted in a number of forms, I would mark ""fair"" unless you have a noticeable darker skin tone with a dark hair stubble before shaving, then go to medium."
89552,mikeymikey,2007-06-30 01:46:00,376,"Thank you both for the answer.  So for ""Port of entry"",,,  I guess I would just write Pearson International Airport?"
