89428,Mattitude,2007-06-29 18:51:00,155,"Just wondering if the ""limestones"" in couchchiching are accessable by road to fish from shore."
89435,charlesn,2007-06-29 19:03:00,551,"It describes a particular area that is fairly expansive, but not accessible to shore fishing.  Easy to find in a rental boat though.   I'd say the best areas start about 200 yards off shore, just look for the rock piles, they are very easy to see.  They were eating up a drop shot, spinnerbait and senko on opening day and got some on a rattle trap too.  Good luck,  Charles"
