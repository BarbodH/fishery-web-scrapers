25884,DanTheMan,2007-01-24 03:23:00,257,"Finally got out ice fishing today.Without  having access to my sled and no shack this year, ice fishing will be limited.I decided that it was finally time to get out  there and try for something.I was hoping that Rocky would of join me,but he had first aid training today.  Me and the wife  and Scooby(Our dog   )decided to try a easy access lake by foot and hope for the best.Well, it was not a slammer by no meens, but it was a 4 hrs mini trip that was lots of fun.I didnt even expect to catch anything,but we manage to get 3 pike/and 3 perch and miss a whole bunch( I'm sure they where mostly perch  )and 0 walleye  and 0 bass  Now I have the bug to go for bigger and better trips!!!  Here's a few pics  A short walk out to our spot     Lots of ice!!!!     Our little set up    The wife jigging(well resting  )    First fish of the year    The wifes first of the year    Cant forget these little guys , our bait was bigger then them    My dog having a blast  "
