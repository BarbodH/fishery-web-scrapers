26518,Gerritt,2007-01-25 18:16:00,6129,CPH... Wish I could make it man!.... Hey could you do me a favour while there though?? Could you look at St.John? and let me know the ice situation? it is just up airport road just past the tracks... Or you could use the Soap factory launch to spy on it.  Thanks brother!  Gerritt.
