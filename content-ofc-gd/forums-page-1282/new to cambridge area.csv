25684,mason05,2007-01-23 22:55:00,258,You could test your luck at Valens Con Area or perhaps Puslinch Lake. They should be safe soon if we get a dip in the temps.  Corn Nug
25696,BFSC Kevin,2007-01-23 23:10:00,1351,"i'll be there this weekend, should be ready by then, supposely valens has 3.5 inch of ice right now, so not yet open."
25919,jediangler,2007-01-24 04:55:00,1923,"You could try Shade's Mill Conservation area. It's right in town and has pike, perch and crappie. I would call first to check ice conditions before you go. Puslinch has pike, perch, crappie, bluegill and the odd walleye. Valens has pike, perch, crappie and bluegill as does Guelph lake. Good luck and we like lots of pics."

Hard water best bets Valens 8 bucks to get in( atomatic gate ), puslinch not sure how much it is too park there now, Shades Mills tough to fish, funny hours doesn't open every year. Lots of fun too be had in the area. Great tackle shop on the corner of King&Eagle. Friendly staff with lots of advise. Good luck"

And yes they are the most knowledgable around for local spots, they have the bait you will need. Tell them Joonmoon sent you, they will look after you.
