25985,superdad,2007-01-24 14:49:00,353,"Lew,  Navionics has released a new card the ' 14XG ' replacing the X9 (eastern Lake ontario etc..)  The new 14xg covers the maritime and the great lakes - those SD cards have huge memories now.  If you find the old eastern lake ontario card, don't pay full price they're discontinued.  BY the way, RadioWorld was selling the 14XG for $239.00 at the Boat Show."
