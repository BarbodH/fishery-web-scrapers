26447,Northhunter,2007-01-25 15:52:00,214,"Is it water? It's water, right   I used to get them bad after a day on the lake or in the bush. I thaught I remember reading they would be more frequent and worse if you were dehydrated."
26459,Rich,2007-01-25 16:19:00,3927,Why not just save the time and post your cure Dr Quinn?

26522,douG,2007-01-25 18:22:00,2693,This would be the 'bar o soap in the bed' cure?
26578,Northhunter,2007-01-25 20:46:00,214,"I saw the soap thing on snopes.com (it was inconclusive), but they talked about leg cramps in the calves.  When I get them they're always in the thigh. I can put my hand against the leg and literally feel the muscle go nuts. Not fun. Only happens after a day of fun (ice fishing, hunting) and after I've rested a while."
