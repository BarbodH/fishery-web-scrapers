26070,aplumma,2007-01-24 18:49:00,6896,Looks good and working with IE 6 with cable. The balloons are to bunched up to get a clear picture of were it really is. The name list below is a big help if you know were you want to go but does little to give you a description as to were it is on the map until you click it. With the 2 MINOR items I mentioned it looks like a great sucess otherwise.  Art
26137,Tdel,2007-01-24 21:05:00,393,Looks ok here TJ.  Using Windows XP Pro and Seamonkey Version 1.07  Tom
25748,TJQ,2007-01-24 00:23:00,7806,"Ok.. for the past two weeks, I've been dinking around and adding lodges to my new site that takes advantage of the new google maps system.  Its pretty finicky stuff and I'm about 80% done, but before I launch it I sure would like to give it a test drive, so I thought perhaps I could get some constructive (LOL) critisism here... have a look when you get a chance and let me know what you think and where I could improve usability...  have a look see...  http://www.ontariooutfittersnetwork.com  Oh...  a couple that are really awesome to zoom in on are Kesagami and Bow Narrows Lodges.. check them out.. the resolution is INCREDIBLE..."
25764,Fisherman,2007-01-24 00:36:00,7201,"NOOOOOOO, 3x blue screen of death, 3x error reporting messages to MSN and finally had to plull the plug from the wall to reboot, not ever touching that one again, sorry. Well being the curious type, I gave it one more try,  I got as far as geting to see Glen Echo Cottage site, backed out, then stuck again, maybe some setting or something in my computer that's doing it. I'll try at work tomorrow night."
25766,TJQ,2007-01-24 00:39:00,7806,"WOW... I've tested it in ie6, ie7, Firefox and Opera.....  Anyone else having issues??"
25769,Daplumma,2007-01-24 00:45:00,1961,Clicked thru a few places worked OK here. Joe
25771,PatB,2007-01-24 00:48:00,104,"Works fine with Netscape, all those balloons, couldn't find your house..LOL Why is everything above North Bay????"
25772,Gerritt,2007-01-24 00:48:00,6129,Worked just fine here.... Mac OSX Tiger and Firefox 2.0.0.1  tested about eight of them  Gerritt.
25776,vance,2007-01-24 00:58:00,719,Even I could figure it out after a bit and it looks pretty good Although I did notice that Pine grove resort is spotted in the wrong area.  vance
25778,TJQ,2007-01-24 01:00:00,7806,"  I didn't know there was anything south of North Bay....  LOL... Pat the site is to promote my northern Ontario Clientele... hence the Northern Ontario Outfitters, Lodges and Resorts Map.  Thanks for giving it a whirl..  Glad it didnt blow your machine up!!   Thanks Vance... Im still fine tuning some of the resorts locations... Thats the thing with the googlemaps.. they have to be right on da money!!"
25794,Rich Clemens,2007-01-24 01:24:00,3131,Played around quite a while and that will be a great addition to the site.  Found Kesigami and that is great detail.  Too bad we don't have that much detail on some of the others I checked out.   Everything seems to be working from here.
25800,solopaddler,2007-01-24 01:29:00,8605,"Worked okay for me as well, although I found the balloon icons to be bunched a little too close together in spots. Not sure how you'd do it differently, but I found it mildly annoying. Also, is the purpose of the site to, as you say, ""promote your clients businesses"", or is it to assist the average joe in trip planning? If it's the latter I'd recommend some kind of feedback forum where people could leave positive or negative criticism for any of the lodges, camps or outposts they've been to. A direct reference from someone who's actually been to a location you're considering is priceless and is without a doubt the best means of making an educated choice....Over time I'm sure you'd be able to accumulate a pretty large data bank of useful feedback.... Anyhow, it's just a thought.  cheers, Mike"
25828,fishindevil,2007-01-24 02:05:00,6254,"looks good to me TJ,i surfed around and no problems wow the detail is amazing right down to individual cottages keep up the good work...cheers"
25830,ccmtcanada,2007-01-24 02:07:00,7971,"Nice work!  Checked it out and it worked just fine.  Using Windows XP, Firefox 5.0  Took me a bit to figure out what happened when I clicked on a link when the map wasn't visible...had to scroll up to see it...  Only suggestion would be to have the page auto scroll to the top once you click on a link below.  Great work!"
25835,TJQ,2007-01-24 02:19:00,7806,"Ya.. a couple of things..  Im hoping (if I can get the code to work) to have it go back up to the map and zoom in once a link is clicked..  thats probably the last thing on my to do list.  And solo.. I make my dough by promoting a specific set of clients.. my job is to get Joe Fisherdude to one of the lodges I promote... no more no less...  This forum gets losts of reports, both good and bad during fishing season as well.."
25839,motv8tr,2007-01-24 02:20:00,2587,"I tried it...sort of, being on dial up I finally had to give up as it was taking too long for the page to load.  Maureen"
25844,bigfish1965,2007-01-24 02:24:00,3382,"Looks awesome (even centered now!).  Like ALL of Google's stuff it is rather Java dependant, so make sure you have all your Java updates."
25852,mepps,2007-01-24 02:41:00,1301,"Looks good! (windows XP, Opera 9.0.1)"
25854,tjsa,2007-01-24 02:43:00,1578,"Works just fine for me using Mozilla, and I can see my house andDanC's House, but Mahumba's place isn't too clear."
25855,Garyv,2007-01-24 02:46:00,547,Worked fine for me. Tried Kesagami and our first cottage there was the one just to the right at the base of the pier.... being that close made me want to go back!
25863,ChrisK,2007-01-24 02:50:00,2772,
25865,Spiel,2007-01-24 02:56:00,9065,"....No issues here TJ, looks good and worked well."
25926,camillj,2007-01-24 05:51:00,1988,Looks good TJ
25931,BFSC Kevin,2007-01-24 06:26:00,1351,i'd say you should automatically jump back to the top to see the map when you have clicked on one of those lodges.
25957,hawkeye,2007-01-24 13:19:00,162,"Loads a little slow, but nice job. As you said WIP, the links at the bottom do not work, i.e. Lost Lake Lodge, but the baloon link works fine"
25960,TJQ,2007-01-24 13:29:00,7806,The purpose of the links at the bottom are to open up the ballon to the camp...  Ill get the code working so that it automatically goes to the balloon..
25992,1leggedangler,2007-01-24 15:09:00,364,"Very cool TJ, I could get around the site pretty easy even with my limited puter skills. Even zoomed into a spot at Kesagami where I managed to beach myself in a wicked lighting and wind storm up there. Good luck with it!  Cheers, 1leg"
