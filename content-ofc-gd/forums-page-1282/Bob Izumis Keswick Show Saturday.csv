The show Bob and crew filmed will air on this Saturday January 27th, 2007 at 9:00 am on Global.  If you are not ice fishing this weekend, tune in to see the show.

26218,fishindevil,2007-01-25 00:11:00,6254,"thanks for the info,   but im surprised bob isnt fishing in south america,he always goes south during the winter,you know like brazil for amazon bass,   i wish he would do more shows where guys like us might acually want to go or afford to go....  i like aaron & barrys show better they at least are not fishing for companies ....but thanks and i will tune in...."
26433,setomonkey,2007-01-25 15:19:00,872,"I like both kinds of shows, those that are ""local"" and give us a chance to learn about waters and tactics that we can actually try, but I like the exotic shows too.  I will probably never get to the Amazon to fish for peacock bass, so it's a blast to see that kind of fishing.  Of course, I don't get to see either kind of show nowadays living w/o cable (by choice)...  Mike"

26658,whitey,2007-01-26 00:14:00,7,"Hi guys.  For the person who said they have expressview.  If you go on Bob's site (real fishing.com) you wills see a show schedule and you will also see a list of stations if you ""fish"" around.  Pun intended.  It should tell you what locations/cable etc the shows air on.  Anyways, enjoy.  We had a blast with Bob, he's a good guy but lilkes to pick on you for sure!
