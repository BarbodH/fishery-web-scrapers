25662,Spiel,2007-01-23 21:48:00,9065,....Well I have ice fished that area many times over the millenia and I'm not sure you'll find much in the way of ice unless you're in some of the marinas or slow moving harbours. To date I've not heard anything that would convince me to drive up.
25665,snag,2007-01-23 22:02:00,1932," Thanks for the reply Spiel,  From the little info I've gleamed, Collingwood harbour may be my only hope?"
25736,irishfield,2007-01-24 00:08:00,26272,I've only seen Nottawasaga Bay frozen over twice in the 18 years I've been flying around up here. Like Spiel says you'll be fishing in a protected bay/marina etc...definitely not on the open lake.
25851,snag,2007-01-24 02:37:00,1932," Thanks Wayne,  Ever troll from your plane?  I bet you've caught a few adrift too."
25858,irishfield,2007-01-24 02:48:00,26272,Haven't trolled to date...but that could change next year on the back lakes!  Here's my buddies set up on his airplane..  
26004,snag,2007-01-24 15:35:00,1932,That's awesome.  You must have marked dozens of lakes that you hope to hit.
