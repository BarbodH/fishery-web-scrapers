26496,irishfield,2007-01-25 17:55:00,26272,..because my new Lund was delivered to Temagami Marine this morning !  
26498,Joey,2007-01-25 17:59:00,9122,Murphy's Law Wayne  Joey
26500,Pinch,2007-01-25 18:00:00,231," Thats ok, my friend just bought a new snowmobile so I expect that the weather will heat up pretty soon and all that snow and ice will disappear!!  "
26502,TAH,2007-01-25 18:02:00,133,"congratulations on the new boat Wayne, now its the waiting game"
26504,Terry,2007-01-25 18:02:00,14456,ha ha .....let us know when you get it and we can all show up with chainsaws and cut you a nice opening in the ice so you can float your boat
26510,Spiel,2007-01-25 18:08:00,9065,".....and mine was delivered to the dealer yesterday.  Not to worry Wayne, you'll have many years to enjoy her!"
26511,irishfield,2007-01-25 18:08:00,26272,"LOL Terry. I think Leah and I are going to go up next weekend. Will have a boo, take some pictures and I suppose have to pay for it as well. Then leave it there, safe in their storage building till ice out. No point in hauling it home, finding room for it here and then hauling it back up in May for first use. Not going to try it out on the Niagara as a first run in February, that's for sure!  Spiel...a new boat?? How many you allowed?"
26516,Kirk,2007-01-25 18:13:00,347,"Congrats wayne, ask the marina if you can bunk overnight with your boat"
26519,Spiel,2007-01-25 18:18:00,9065,.....No not new Wayne at least not yet.
26521,Terry,2007-01-25 18:21:00,14456,"if you are leaving it there, I hope you have insurance on it I know a guy that bought a boat left it at the dealer..it was stolen and had a heck of a time getting them to pay he didn't have any insurance on it"
26526,irishfield,2007-01-25 18:26:00,26272,"Maybe take a job as the night watchman, to help pay for it, and just sleep in the boat Kirk... lol  I hear yah Terry. I haven't paid anything for it yet...other than the loss of my Glastron as trade. They haven't asked for payment yet and it wasn't a pressed issue when I ordered it. They know me, where to find me, and will only get worried when Lund is looking for their money. Once I have to cough up, YES, it will be insured for sure."
26555,tonyb,2007-01-25 19:09:00,1637,"When can we start making reservations to fish in it?  You're a lucky man Wayne, I am dreaming for the day when I can have a Lund to call my own.  Tony"
26556,John,2007-01-25 19:16:00,2956,"Wayne, why don't you pull it down to see Glen for a few days and christen it in 'bama.........."
26560,dustink,2007-01-25 19:26:00,526,Congrats Wayne!  Looking forward to some pictures....  dk
26588,Whopper,2007-01-25 21:19:00,2174, Ditto Dustin's remarks Wayne!  Cool deal bud!  Whopper
26593,camillj,2007-01-25 21:24:00,1988,wow !!! That was quick ... you mean they got all the barf and cigarette butts cleaned off it already ?
26594,irishfield,2007-01-25 21:45:00,26272,LOL...can't rattle my nerves (anymore) Bud. I know it went direct from Minnesota to Temagami with no Boat shows enroute.  Tonyb...now you have a reason to make it to Lakair. Leah will be selling charter tickets from the bench at the gas dock. Whopper already has his from advance sales... LOL
