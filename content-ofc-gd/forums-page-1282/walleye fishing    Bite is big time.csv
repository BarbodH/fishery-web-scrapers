26183,skevys,2007-01-24 22:47:00,27,"Just to let every-one know with the extreme cold we are getting in the next few days this weekend will be a go. But still stay away from current areas. I do have a huge amount of minnows on hand , all the jigs required for the area , portable ice huts , spuds , vexlars , foot treads and on and on. You can probably name it and I got it. The most asked question I get is do I have licenses. Yep you bet. I have both resident and non-resident. Have fun be safe and bring back everything you took with you, Ron "
