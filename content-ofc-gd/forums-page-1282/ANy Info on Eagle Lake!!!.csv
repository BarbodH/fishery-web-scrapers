25946,brickNblock,2007-01-24 12:12:00,598,Dont have any real info for you...but any lake up that way should be exellent fishing. Darrly Chronzy has done several shoots for his show on Eagle Lake  targeting Walleye (pickeral) and they seem to be plentiful and all were fished with just jig heads and twister tails. The FAN540 sports radio show just gave out a prize last week to some lucky 'dawg to go there too for an all expense paid trip...was that you ?
