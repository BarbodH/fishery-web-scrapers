26079,Hellfish6,2007-01-24 19:08:00,12,"Just a quick question  Just curious if anyone has any experience with Gloomis Frontier rods 1 piece 6""5. Will be using for dragging tubes for bass. Any info would be appreciated. The price for it is 119.99 plus Tax New. Thanx in advance"
26085,Mike Pike,2007-01-24 19:23:00,1332,"Wow, didn't realize you could get a GLoomis for that price!  I have a few  GLoomis rods and love 'em all.  I have a 6'2"" walleye series that I use for bouncing grubs and dragging tubes and love it.  As long as it has a med-fast action and a bit of stiffness that lets you reeeeally feel every rock 'n weed your tube comes across, it's a good choice.   IMHO.  Hopefully someone with the Frontier series can tell you more."
26089,Hellfish6,2007-01-24 19:28:00,12,"The guy im buying it from is going out of business, so im hoping it is a good deal"
26090,carll2,2007-01-24 19:28:00,443,"very good rods.. i tryed my friends small 1 piece 5 foot jigging rod, and was amazed.. you can feel everything all for under 140$ very good quality"
26093,solopaddler,2007-01-24 19:31:00,8605,"They're good rods, not a thing wrong with them, but they're not true Loomis rods. They are in fact Rainshadow RX7 blanks made by Batson for Loomis Canada."
26099,Tacklebuster,2007-01-24 19:45:00,303,"I have three Loomis rods, two are 1 piece 6' rods, IMX and a HMX, and they are with out a doubt my favourite rods.  I use them mostly for tubing, bass, walleye, and even for tossing spinners for pike.  They are very light, and sensative.  Put your best reel on it, and I am sure it will become your favourite combo."
26151,moosehead,2007-01-24 21:43:00,90,What store is this? Maybe some other good deals to be had by other members
26157,Steve,2007-01-24 21:55:00,2075,"listen to solopaddler, he speaks the truth.  a frontier is not even a g loomis made blank."
26174,barracuda,2007-01-24 22:30:00,41," HMX is from Fenwick ain't it?  As far as the Frontiers go, nice sticks but as others have said, they're Rainshadows. I think Loomis Canada distributes them or something though so they're covered under Loomis warranty."
26176,Hellfish6,2007-01-24 22:34:00,12,"Thnx for all the replies, i ended up buying that rod but @ Fishin Niagara in Fort Erie, for around 140.00 decided to give him the business. The store is The Outdoor Store in Welland that originally offered @ that price. Almost bought a drop shooting Crucial but decided that Frontier was the better buy. Thnx again"
26179,Gerritt,2007-01-24 22:35:00,6129,I would Expect Spiel should answer this thread at some point... he has been building loomis  rods for years... and has even done a few frontiers...  Look forward to his post once he sees this thread.  Gerritt.
26198,aplumma,2007-01-24 23:36:00,6896,Yea I think Spiel can add some insight however I do know that he does build on the Frontier blanks.  Art
26234,Hellfish6,2007-01-25 00:44:00,12,Wouldnt mind hearing what Spiel has to say.
