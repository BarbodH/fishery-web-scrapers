25843,kemper,2007-01-24 02:22:00,2232,Am I the only one that gets some load of crap sites everytime I click on a google link right now? Im trying to do homework and copying and pasting links is wasting my time. Is it google or just my piece of junk that could be called a computer?

26036,camillj,2007-01-24 17:25:00,1988,I use counterspy ... and kerio personal firewall ... nod32 ... no pop-ups and no nasty hijacks ....(on my laptop) ... knock on wood  On my desktop its Norton Internet Security ... not convinced about it though ... still seem to get the occasional issues although they seem to go away once their updates get caught up .... normally same day.  I run NIGHTLY scans on the counterspy though .. you'd be surprised how much crap gets through (and caught) especially with kids in the house
