26133,dobber1978,2007-01-24 21:00:00,13,"      Heading out ice fishing for the first time of the season, well first time in a long time,  Looking for a little advice, I want to purchse a couple rod/reel combos for ice fishing and want to know which ones are best, I have been looking on the canadian tire website and they have a few different kinds.  The first is an open bail style, basicall looks like a mini fishing rod, the other is more like a bait caster style that mostly looks like plastic construction.  I have only really used a spool of line and tip up before so I am trying to upgrade,  For lures, as I don't know if we will be able to find live bait, what is good for Pike, Pickeral, and lake trout, any suggestions???   Thanks all Jeff"

26229,walleyejigger,2007-01-25 00:37:00,876,"i had that plastic one a long time ago, might still have it, i liked it for jigging spoons for lakers and hand lining the fish up the hole, i would not recommend it as a ""rod or reel"""

26373,joonmoon,2007-01-25 05:32:00,528,"I bought all my rods and reel combos from Tall Tales in Cambridge and Walmart. I found CTC stuff is junk, spend a few bucks and get good quality rod and reel combos. Lures tipped with a minnow is good, jigs and berkley baits tipped with a minnow is good and sometimes just a simple drop line with a hook and minnow are needed. I do suggest you buy the best quality you can afford cause it sux losing a decent fish because your equipment is less than standard, such as the first photo and even the qualitity of the second one...I dunno...something about a company called Sub-Zero....naaa no good. Good luck."
26473,tbayboy,2007-01-25 16:47:00,1497,When I went ice fishing up in Thunder Bay over the holidays I picked up a couple basic rod/reals spooled with 6lb mono and some glowing jigs and a couple rattle spoons for about $75 all in.  We got out on the ice and did all right but next to us were guys pulling walleye after walleye out and their equipment: 6lb line tied to a twig embedded in the ice and a single treble hook tipped with a minnow so you never know  (actually the also had jigging rods like us going and weren't doing any better than us with that equipment - the simplest presentation won that day)
