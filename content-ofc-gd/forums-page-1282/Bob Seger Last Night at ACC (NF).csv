He rocked a sold out crowd and his voice is 100% good as it ever was and I am not giving him any special treatment for being an older guy, it was 100% perfect.  Turn the Page with Seger on piano goes down as one of the all time live performances I've ever seen (and I've seen a few).  If he comes to your town and you are a fan, this is a show not to be missed."
