26043,FishFinder,2007-01-24 17:33:00,481,Ive never really ice fished before so i want some tips on what to buy and what to stay away from. Ill proably target perch/sunfish for the begging then move on to rainbows in stocked lakes. Thanks!
26045,irishfield,2007-01-24 17:37:00,26272,Pair of ice picks. Worn around your neck at all times or cord attached to the front of your jacket/suit and stored in an easy access pocket.
26048,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-24 17:48:00,0,"Here's a quick checklist of some of the things you'll need to get you started:  -  Rod/ Reel combo  - I would go with a light based on what you indicated you were targetting -  Line -  I would get 4 or 6 pound ice line -  Hand auger  -  You could probably get away with a 6"" but I would got with an 8"" personally (Normark's are good) -  Ladel - to scoop the ice away from your hole. -  Minnowbucket / seat - they come with styrofoam insulation and serve as a seat. -  Spreaders-  to use if you are fishing with minnows. -  JiggingRaps/ Jigs-  a few to get you started -  Toboggan-  to put your stuff on when you walk out on the ice. - Icecleats- are handy for traction to attach to your boots.  If you find yourself really getting into it, you might want to look at a portable ice hut.  Makes a big difference.  As Wayne said, ice picks for safety.  I've probably forgot a thing or two but that should get you started.  Good luck."
26051,LeXXington,2007-01-24 17:52:00,1928,Do -NOT- buy the cheap plastic ladel for clearing ice. Save yourself a couple bucks and get a good one to start the plastic ones break far to easy
26053,FishFinder,2007-01-24 17:55:00,481,"Cool thanks for the response, another question.. I have heard salted minnows produce just as well, Is that true? and how do i go about salting them, i know they work well on the niagara but then again the rivers currents give them a life like action.  Thanks"
26056,PatB,2007-01-24 17:59:00,104,As irishfield said also a whistle tied to your survial suit and a safety rope.
26076,PERCHER,2007-01-24 19:05:00,787,Maybe even a floater suit.
26160,irishfield,2007-01-24 22:03:00,26272,"BTW...the picks are only $9.99 at CTC. You can also buy a safety kit for $13.99. It's a set of picks, whistle and foot cleats."
