26300,ccmtcanada,2007-01-25 02:40:00,7971,Welcome Lake Simcoe messageboard members!
26302,Joey,2007-01-25 02:47:00,9122,The community pulling together.  Way to go guys.  Welcome Member.  Joey

26320,ChrisK,2007-01-25 03:36:00,2772,Welcome aboard Simcoe members!!! 
26343,T Fisher,2007-01-25 04:23:00,139,"WTG OFC that's great, I will past the word around to other Simcoe members.  TF"
26346,camillj,2007-01-25 04:28:00,1988,Classy move guys.  Welcome LSF members !
26353,JerseyDog,2007-01-25 04:34:00,190,"I was thinking the same thing - stand up move on the part of OFC to assume duties will that board is offline.  I don't even fish Simcoe, but I do like to read the posts once in a while to see how its going.  And sometimes if I'm lucky, the Gbay action gets a mention, which is alway a bonus for me."
26357,Beans,2007-01-25 04:51:00,3339,I cut my message board teeth on the old Simcoe board after hearing about it from Chris' dad while fishing off the little dock at Bradford...  How does one post a message in the new area ?
26359,TJQ,2007-01-25 04:53:00,7806,Same way as here... just to be clear... we are not hijacking anyones board.. and once they have it up and running we will be pulling it down...  just hate to see the reports stop at this crucial time of year!!  As soon as the new board is announced we will post it here and keep a link to it for awhile..
26368,bigfish1965,2007-01-25 05:17:00,3382,What TJ said. We just wanted the guys to have a spot until they get sorted out. We know what it's like to have to make major changes and what it is like for the members to have to endure it. Hope the guys get it sorted soon so their members can feel at ease. Anyone taking advantage of such a situation is unethical IMHO.
