25961,Zib,2007-01-24 13:33:00,369,The guys that caught it post back on the cooks bay fishing board and said that they used 4 Lb test.
25962,tonyb,2007-01-24 13:46:00,1637,"Saw several of them coming off the ice last year.  Guys caught them on teardrops with perch minnows  What next?!  That's an awesome fish, I can only imagine the fight he had on his hands lol.  Tony"
25963,jediangler,2007-01-24 13:47:00,1923,"They sure weren't fishing through a 6"" hole."
25973,RobHall,2007-01-24 14:19:00,261,
25974,Joey,2007-01-24 14:19:00,9122,"I've seen them caught through the ice on Cook's Bay before, I have a pic at home and will post it later.  It was big also.  The guy had to chip the hole bigger to get it out.  That one is Huge!!!  Joey"
25989,steverowbotham,2007-01-24 15:02:00,1800,unreal.  thats pretty cool.
26041,camillj,2007-01-24 17:35:00,1988,"omigod !!!! Thats wild .. I have never seen carp come through the ice (but then I dont ice fish in carp waters) .... wow ....I mean WOW !    Borrowed this from Dan's thread ... but heres another reason not to mess around with 6"" augers  :)"
26052,mattyk,2007-01-24 17:54:00,2110,"Thats one big mama of a fish. Not as big as that european pig in the previous ppost,  but a biggen."
26105,moemoe,2007-01-24 19:59:00,352,Thats a huge fish!! I'd love to be there when your trying to chip a hole out because there is 40lbs of weight on the end of line
26191,dsn,2007-01-24 23:17:00,1018,I thought carp only feed in warm waters they turn off when the water temps get cold.   Strange
26237,fishindevil,2007-01-25 00:50:00,6254,WOW...they had to have had a bigger hole than a 10' auger could make.   did they cut it out of the ice???hmmmmmmm thats a huge carp
26246,mikeh,2007-01-25 01:02:00,824,DSN....the link that you gave does not give the details of the fish that was caught. it sends me to another message board that I have to logon to . oh well I guess we will never know the full story. nice fish.
26278,Joey,2007-01-25 02:02:00,9122,Okay I found the picture.  This was caught by some guy one Cook's Bay out of Gilford.  Unfortunately there is nothing in the pic to compare how big it is.  Although it is not nearly as large as the one above    Cheers.  Joey
26312,Rizzo,2007-01-25 03:16:00,4754,"big fish! looks like they kicked it around like a soccerball for a bit, seems to be marked up (guess it ain't easy pulling a submarine like that through a small hole in the ice...probably nailed it in the chops a few times when they were trying to make the hole bigger)"
26334,setomonkey,2007-01-25 04:06:00,872,"It would be pretty hard to get that fish through a 6"" hole...  Mike"
26669,Golfisher,2007-01-26 00:53:00,586,Carp through the ice... now I've seen everything.
26672,bassmaster4,2007-01-26 01:02:00,801,damn thats one big carp and through the ice no less
26694,Guest gbfisher,2007-01-26 02:32:00,0,James Meeger and I were out there when he caught it. Saw him draggin it around...Thought it was a pike or pickerel from far away. Huge fish for sure.
