25972,OhioFisherman,2007-01-24 14:18:00,6623,"Dang Glen a coat? Couple of guys I know also have the aqua views or similar cameras, same deal, need pretty clear water for them to be of much use."
25975,Joey,2007-01-24 14:21:00,9122,"Well no wonder it looked murky in your aquaview G, you had it in the snow  Nice little cats there.  Joey"
25977,RobHall,2007-01-24 14:25:00,261, What is the price range of the under water cameras?  Just curious.  fishinonthebrain 
26002,OhioFisherman,2007-01-24 15:32:00,6623,"Just checked my BPS catalog(2007) 230 to 2000 US dollars( I am in USA) friends paid less than 300 I think, don`t  know which model they have.  One buddie fishes crappie  tournies, a clear lake he could see them bite and not feel them, water conditions here usually aren`t that good.  Another buddie used his at Chautaqua lake in NY and saw fish (walleye or ski as I recall)bumping his camera not his lure, LOL. It did allow him to see why fish frequented the spot. He won one of our club tournies at the spot, and since hasn`t hit the spot the same time as the fish. He won the tournie before he got the camera.  A tool, if you got the money to spend it may be of some use, just don`t know about depending on them too much."
26013,Whopper,2007-01-24 15:57:00,2174,Good deal Glen! Glad to see ya out and about. Must have been chilly (below 70   ) cause your all bundled up
26014,dustink,2007-01-24 16:04:00,526,Nice report!  Thanks for obfuscating to keep us guessing!  dk
26016,Roy,2007-01-24 16:08:00,13728,Nice sweater there Glen. Is that the new one? Maybe you could convince your Mum in law to make me one. 'Twould only take but an ounce or two of wool.
26062,aplumma,2007-01-24 18:20:00,6896,Yes when you are watchin the tv screen wondering if it was a fish.... you dont notice your pole jumping all around. Kind of reminds me of the first time I got a rear view mirror on my bicycle. I was watchen that mirror so much I drove the bike into a ditch.  Art
26067,Joey,2007-01-24 18:35:00,9122, You do realize you just admitted that out loud don't you Art  Joey
