26272,huntervasili,2007-01-25 01:48:00,1604,where Did the link for the Chat go...? am I looking in the wrong place... or am I just Crazzzy? I see now that there is a tab on the top of the site but could have sworn there was one in the Main Section.. Someone please tell me I am not crazy... Ohh and who wants to go on the Chat by the way?  there are like 80 members on... lets have a friendly conversation or argument
