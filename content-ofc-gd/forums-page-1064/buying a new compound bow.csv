175755,richyb,2008-03-24 22:34:00,774,haha  ok maybe a little fishing ... i havent been bowfishing but i sure would love to try it ..  thanks for the reply
175765,Smokey,2008-03-24 22:59:00,1278,I've always been a hoyt guy but would imagine most bows on the market now are all great. The competition is so tight anymore and with all the new technology the playing field has evened out. I would suggest going and shooting one at a pro shop and seeing how it fits you. Try as many as you can and you'll know the right one when you get it in your hands.  Good Luck

If you are confortable setting up a bow from scratch there are some great deals on ebay from the states for New Hoyt vectrics for 500$ I have been thinking about it too, have an older Jennings Speedstar that I still use but an extra 75 fps and quiet shooting is really tempting me."
175785,richyb,2008-03-24 23:43:00,774,Thanks for the replys guys ... .its going to be either the bowtech guardian or the 101st airborne.  im going to look at a local archery shop tomorow to see which one feels better ... i have only heard good things about both and i hate making decisions !!!
