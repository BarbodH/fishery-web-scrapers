Tried roe bags and all kind of artificials, but couldent get bit. Then I tried some dead baits(3-4 inch shiners) I had left over from ice fishing and hit a couple steelhead and my brother got one on a power minnow.    Nothing for the next hour or so. So we decided to try a different spot. Saw this on the walk back and thought it looked pretty neat.    Down lower in the river there was only 3-4 foot of vis. But we got into a few browns using power minnows.    "
