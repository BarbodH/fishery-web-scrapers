174813,ehg,2008-03-22 07:59:00,2666,"Hi, managed to get out for softwater again. Didn't fish for nearly 5 months until about a month ago but went out 4 times in last month to make up for missing out. Soon most species and locations are closed for over a month or so, except some Great Lake streamouths for trout so it was good to get out fishing before relative lull in action again.  Caught a variety of fish and took photos so thought i'd share. First few fish of the afternoon were one of my favorite kind, the white bass   Also caught these fish which i like, brown trout these fish jump like crazy and fight the best.   more   These fish are usually plentiful sheepshead   This next one was a little odd but not a first caught a predatory carp   This fish hit a jointed shad rap. Had them hit rattle traps here before and hit jigs for walleyes in Kawarthas but a fairly rare occurrence.   Also caught some OOS bass and walleye i'll add a walleye pic to round out multispecies effect.     As soon as the full moon started to rise to the east the fishing died off and called it a day.   Also caught some fish that fought for awhile and quite well, but got unhooked before i was able to see them. Not a bad little mixed bag i guess to end the winter season. Can't wait for the spring and summer. It was a tad chilly out there again."
174815,SlowPoke,2008-03-22 08:43:00,2984,Well done!!! You caught everything but a skunk! -Brian
174817,brickNblock,2008-03-22 09:33:00,598,she  was a cold one out yesterday...... I know exactly where you were fishing there Bud! In the summer you can almost walk on the backs of  the sheepshead all the way to shore....they do put up a decent fight too. What a nice outing ehg........good to see a softwater report..thanks.
174833,b2kptbo,2008-03-22 12:11:00,1505,"Nice mixed bag for sure, WTG..."
174836,Sandbag,2008-03-22 12:17:00,533,Awesome stuff...thanks for taking the time to post  Cheers  Craig
174846,fatherof3,2008-03-22 13:25:00,1769,"quite the mixed catch,congrats"
174876,majorlifts,2008-03-22 15:05:00,171,"Ok ok, this is the truly bizarre part, when I saw that Carp come in with the lure in its mouth I was almost sure I was in the twilight zone. I have never in my life seen a carp so hungry it hit a lure. Now I can truly say when it comes to fishing and weird happenings I have seen it all."
174886,smbhunter,2008-03-22 15:29:00,186,Awesome pics! Good job and nice multi species outing. That is one nice white bass.
174889,tbayboy,2008-03-22 15:38:00,1497,Another great mix.  That carp with a with a lure in its mouth is pretty bizarre but they way your month has been going I'm not surprised.
174926,Joey,2008-03-22 17:23:00,9122,Very nice mixed bag.  That is a sweet pickerel.  Them thar carps are a weird bunch aren't they  Joey
174929,mepps,2008-03-22 17:40:00,1301,"nicely done, you dont see a mixed bag like that everyday!"
175006,007,2008-03-22 23:23:00,537,"Nice catch ehg. It's great fun catching a variety of fish and not quite knowing what's coming up next.  Bet the carp was a surprise.  You certainly were rewarded for your efforts out in the cold.  Thanks for sharing.  Can't wait to see more softwater reports in spring and summer - I'm really going to suffer when those come in, and I'll wish I was back in Ontario.  007"
175029,fishindevil,2008-03-23 01:15:00,6254,"Great day on lake ontario !!!!     cheers,thats the part about that lake that i like,theres everything that awims,!!"
175160,ehg,2008-03-23 14:03:00,2666,"Thanks for replies so far. Can't help but have a good day here at this time however. Kinda like ' fish in barrel' right now. Used the same jointed shad rap for all fish all afternoon. No finessing needed. Personally think the pre-full moon rising caused the carp even to feed actively.  Yup, we are blessed here in Ontario to be able to catch many fine species. That is truely the fun. At this spot you never know what is next.   Since they closed shoreline access there is virtually little pressure here, saw one other boat out this winter. These fish come by from the big lake and stop for a bite during their travels. It really dies off here in next few weeks as trout head to tribs, but the sheepshead seem to stick around.   ehg"
175311,mikeh,2008-03-23 20:49:00,824,"nice bunch of fish, your hard work payed off. Another great post EHG"
175349,Greencoachdog,2008-03-23 22:54:00,8163,Great report and pics!!!   All good lookin' fish!!!  It still looks pretty dang chilly up there...
175397,gone_fishin,2008-03-24 00:53:00,481,nice day out indeed... my biggest carp to date was caught on a floating perch coloured rapala. they are strange creatures sometimes.
175441,ehg,2008-03-24 02:35:00,2666,"Thanks for further replies. It certainly was chilly ( 28F w/ a wind chill).  That carp was a strange catch since i was targeting brown trout. Usually only get out 2 or 3 times a winter, the north wind and general conditions allowed for more the last month or so.  Just happy to get out on the softwater and catch some fish.  cheers,  ehg"
175539,snag,2008-03-24 13:29:00,1932,"Nice one again,  You even make that sheephead look sexy!"
175803,ehg,2008-03-24 23:59:00,2666,"Thanks SNAG, These fish posed themselves. Sexy? i don't know."
