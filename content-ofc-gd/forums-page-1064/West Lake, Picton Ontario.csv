174879,jughead,2008-03-22 15:16:00,92,"Hello all,  I will be staying at a cottage on West lake the middle of June. I grew up in Belleville and fished the lake 25 years ago and used to do ok with walleye, small pike and bass. Walleye and Pike are open during my time there but I have no idea what the fishing on the lake is like a quarter century since the last time I wet a line there.  Just curious if anyone from the area can give me some info on present day conditions.  Greg"
174949,redfin,2008-03-22 18:55:00,79,"Everything you mentioned above.  The occasion salmon and trout swim into the inlet from time to time, lots of black crappies to be had to keep you interested.  Oh...and carp too. Good luck."
174952,huntervasili,2008-03-22 19:00:00,1604,"Some really good walleye fishing. I have been a few times at West Lake Willows... only good things to say about Scott and his family. For walleye we did really well with worm harnesses and spinners. Pike and walleye can also be had on crankbaits but we caught anywhere from 10-20 walleye a day there between my self and my brother as well as some pike, and the odd bass... Jigging also produces pretty well in there. West lake is one place I also plan on heading this spring, mmm mmm Walleye!"
174960,POLLIWOGG,2008-03-22 19:09:00,835,"When the fishns hot its hot, when its not its not, but Ive fished BOQ once in 2 years if that tells you anything..  That pile of rocks hasn't gone anywhere."
174962,huntervasili,2008-03-22 19:18:00,1604,"ohh and to mention it, I have yet to be skenked on WL from both shore and boat each time I attempted to fish it"
174967,gone_fishin,2008-03-22 19:47:00,481,"I've been fishing there regularly for the last 12 or so years. my grandparents lived in Wellington for a while and as i was growing up, i would fish there every time i visited them. lots of pike, walleye, and bass... but since you're there mid June, Bass wont be open yet... I'll probably be there pretty much every weekend as soon as walleye and pike open on May 3rd. watch for my reports come May."
174993,jughead,2008-03-22 21:53:00,92,"Thanks all, can't see it being a bad time, will likely get out for a couple/few hours each day and will stick to the usual suspects for bait and tackle. Ideally get enough for a meal and shame the father from the other family with my hunter gatherer skills."
175094,Stoty,2008-03-23 04:10:00,2910,watch out for the MNR. they are all over that lake. make sure you have your license with you.
175097,huntervasili,2008-03-23 04:17:00,1604,If ya need a rental West Lake Willows rents boats... Have a good time and good luck on the water
175293,gone_fishin,2008-03-23 19:58:00,481,"The Reel Thing tackle shop in Wellington also rents boats, not sure of the comparison in prices of both places, but the reel thing is too expensive for a boat rental in my books."
175299,gone_fishin,2008-03-23 20:13:00,481,here are the 2 websites...  http://www.thereelthingfishing.com/  http://www.westlakewillows.com/index.html  both are too expensive in my opinion...  you can get a boat/motor and full tank of gas on rice lake for $50... someone on West lake needs to open up another rental operation and charge less than these places to drive their prices down.
175414,workwear,2008-03-24 01:35:00,592,"50 bucks a day??...the nerve of some ppl who invest thousands in equipment and pay more in insurance and gas  hell i should open a place up and PAY fishermen to use my boats and gas,........the nerve of some of the operators trying to make a buck....."
175699,bigbuck,2008-03-24 20:14:00,2449,Who rents  on Rice for 50bucks?? I'm in for that this summer.
175705,cranks bait,2008-03-24 20:32:00,721,"$50.00 rentals is cheap.  Our marina here rents for about $200.00 a day, depending on the boat."
