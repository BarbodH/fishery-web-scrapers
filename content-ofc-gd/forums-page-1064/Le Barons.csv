175546,Alumacraft,2008-03-24 14:16:00,139,I was wondering if anyone knew when the next no tax sale is ??
175550,BillM,2008-03-24 14:22:00,17367,"Did you try calling Le Baron's and asking?  Not to be a smartass, but you probably would have had your answer by now"
175552,silveradosheriff,2008-03-24 14:26:00,1025,"Usually, not til Father's Day.  BTW - they have increased their Lebaron club discount to 10%, which leaves a 3% gap between this and the no tax event.  If you are consider a larger purchase, this might be the way to go...."
175563,bucktail,2008-03-24 15:21:00,1857,I assume you cant do the club discount and the no tax thing at the same time?
175566,silveradosheriff,2008-03-24 15:29:00,1025,You are correct BT.....also doesn't apply to sale items.
175568,bucktail,2008-03-24 15:35:00,1857,Thanks silver always wondered.
