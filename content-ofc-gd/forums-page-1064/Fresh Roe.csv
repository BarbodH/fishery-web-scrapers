175199,buckster,2008-03-23 16:04:00,530,I have only cured roe one way with salt and brown sugar.   Anyone have and diff methods.  I wanted to keep it fresh how do i go about doing that?
175201,FishFinder,2008-03-23 16:08:00,481,no cure is the best cure
175209,ChrisK,2008-03-23 16:32:00,2772,"Best way is to water harden your eggs naturally.... Might be a little late for this method but, Take a pair of nylons from your wifes drawer and cut the bottoms off. Make shure theres no holes. Put fresh roe from fish after caught in the nylon and gently rince in a nice clean pool at the river preferably with some current going by to wash away the impurities. Let sit  in a clean pool of water for five or ten minutes and repeat. Now drain eggs of water competely and place in cooler. This seems to work for me and I even freeze the eggs afterwords and it doesn't seem to bother them...  Good Luck !!"
175270,buckster,2008-03-23 19:15:00,530,if i dont cure them how do i store them and how long are they good for?   Do i have to rinse them with water then dry them and freeze them?
175290,Canuck2fan,2008-03-23 19:53:00,1444,"If loose and water cured in the stream where you got them they could last up 3 or 4 weeks in the fridge.... If they are still in the skien and you bled the hen right after catching they should last about 10 days maybe more refrigerated. What I like to do with eggs in the skien is tie them right away and then freeze em in batches big enough for an outing. I really don't have much experience with using cures because so far leaving them all natural works great. On Friday I was using some eggs I caught on boxing day and tied that night and froze. I caught as many fish as anybody who was using fresh roe from that week..... Freezing them TIED first, right away to me keeps them the best if you can't use them in a week or less though. I tried to freeze a skien one time and then thaw it to tie and it was so gooey and hard to work with. Loose eggs water hardened and frozen then tied are easy to work with though...."
175301,buckster,2008-03-23 20:21:00,530,cool thanks canucks2fan......... do u scrape them off the skien or do u just tie them in the skien?  How long do they last if u freeze them?
175303,steelhedrmatt,2008-03-23 20:27:00,278,"If their still in the skein, spoon them out, rinse in spring water, and shake and bake in Borax. For loose eggs, water harden in the river, make salt brine from river water, let sit in brine for about 1 hour, dry and store in fridge. I have loose eggs in the fridge from 3 years ago. Never frozen, and still as good as the day I caught the fish."
175309,buckster,2008-03-23 20:45:00,530,"ya ive been doing some reading looks like borax is the way to go.    After i mix in the borax do i have to rinse it off, or do i just leave them coverd in the borax"
175335,steelhedrmatt,2008-03-23 22:01:00,278,I leave the borax. a ligt dusting over the now loose eggs is what you should see

Ps Steve and I had a decent afternoon out where you were fishing on the weekend and they were hitting roe pretty good!
