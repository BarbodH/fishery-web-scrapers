175812,Mike01,2008-03-25 00:10:00,378,"I remember about 10 years ago we had snow like that here in North Bay.  I don't think it was quite that high, but when you opened the garage door you couldn't see out."

175966,LundGuy,2008-03-25 03:18:00,169,"Looks a lot like Christmas  I am originally from Montreal and back in the fifties we had snow similar to that. We would toboggan off the garage roofs and climb out the second floor windows to get out of the house. Pictures are great , they bring back a lot of memories."
176010,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-25 08:46:00,1183,"Whatever would Toronto do, or Vancouver for that matter ?   Unbelievable and depressing for them...never mind the damage and already the loss of life...not sure if it took place there but already there have been too many."
176013,Rich Clemens,2008-03-25 10:23:00,3131,That's where you shovel ...shovel ... and shovel.  Then sit down and cry. Thanks for the link and being able to see those pics.  Dang glad it ain't here.  Kinda reminds me a bit of Central New York a year or two where some places got over 100 inches of that Winter Wonderland.
