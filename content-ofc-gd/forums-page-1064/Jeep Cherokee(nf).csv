175383,Garry2Rs,2008-03-24 00:31:00,1425,I think it was Terry who once said that JEEP stood for Just Extremely Expensive Parts
175385,Loonietoon,2008-03-24 00:33:00,1450,Check in the Classified.. I have one for sale
175390,kemper,2008-03-24 00:36:00,2232,"I had one for a week.  Yes, a week. My grandfather gave it to me as he never  drove it and I quickly found out why, unless there is a gas station on every corner you are going to run out. GUZZLER!"
175392,Loonietoon,2008-03-24 00:41:00,1450,"I don't know what you were doing wrong, but John and myself went to Lakair last summer towing the boat fully loaded on $80.00 worth of gas at I believe 1.09 per ltr..."
175396,Raf,2008-03-24 00:49:00,3495,"i'm happy with mine.  bought it used a couple of years ago.  power steering pump went on me - easy fix, that's it.  the straight six is a simple time tested motor, it'll last a long time and it's easy to work on if you have to.  gas mileage is relative to what you're used to driving.    i don't find it all that bad.  wife/gf may complain about the rough ride but it's a truck.  it's been a useful vehicle; tows a 17' lund and 4x4 goes through anything."
175412,kuhaman,2008-03-24 01:29:00,503,A buddy of mine told me it stood for junk engineering executed poorly! They do seem like a lot of truck for not too much money though.  Mika

175431,Daplumma,2008-03-24 02:00:00,1961,"I have had a couple over the years.The 4.0 six is a rock to be sure,can't hurt it!Not the greatest ride and the fuel mileage aint great but it will run forever.The ABS on the early 90 years was a problem butr otherwise its all good. Joe"
175464,kemper,2008-03-24 03:36:00,2232,The one I am referring to was a 4.8 or 4.6...cant remember but it was the V8.  and ate gas.
175851,Loonietoon,2008-03-25 00:45:00,1450,"Thats the problem, they were a pig on fuel... especially with that motor"
