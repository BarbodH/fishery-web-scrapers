The parents used to own a resort there, now taken over by Sturgeon Bay and run down  There are a few resorts up there. Pretty pricey though.  Have a look here: Pointe Au Baril Chamber  The main resorts are listed there. There are smaller places too, up in Bayfield, plus the Ojibway (dont know if its all private) and there are a few places for rent on Shawanaga Bay that are privately owned cottages. Or you could just camp at Stugeon Bay. Its a great park, nice and small. Jigger has also been there so PM him if you want his opinion.  As for fishing in August, depending on the time, early August (hot day and night) late August (hot only during the day) fishing is usually great. Bass really seem to turn on the last week of July/first week of August. You have Pike, bass, pickeral, and a lot of pan fish.  Its a great place to go, and if you can get out on the water, its beautiful up there.  Let me know if you want any more info and I will gladly help you out."

175450,muskymike,2008-03-24 03:02:00,772,I know. These pictures are all I have to look forward to.
175451,discophish,2008-03-24 03:08:00,392,"Hey Bare, the Baril is a file place to vacation.  I'm sure you have found most of the resorts listed at the chamber.  you will have an amazing time.  I have been going to the cottage there for over 33 years now, and wouldn't trade it for the world.  Beautiful place.  Musky Mike, the later pictures looks alot like the South Mag.  Great shots!"
175454,muskymike,2008-03-24 03:13:00,772,"Hey Disco,  Those last 2 were taken in November on Shawanaga River. It was the end of a long cold day with about 10 eye's to show for it for that day. Cold."

175487,OhioFisherman,2008-03-24 05:55:00,6623,"Went there for 25 years still my favorite place in the world, besides fish you got scenery! Stayed at Kenlea camp for a lot of years but it was getting rundown, with the wife and kids at Rockpine cottages, nice place but it`s been almost 20 years,"
