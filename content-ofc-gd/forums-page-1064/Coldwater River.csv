175617,krawler,2008-03-24 17:29:00,167,"Bows are in there now but not in any decent numbers, lots of wood, bring a ton of hooks, re-tie every 10 drifts or so.  we catch cats in there in may/june but you have to know where to go and preffered if you have a boat.  some pike to be had, also prefer if u have boat and i wouldnt be surprised if some largies were around in summer.  difficult accessing the river but in town its best for salmon/trout.  hope this helps"

176052,Mike Pike,2008-03-25 12:34:00,1332,"Just down from that pier you fish, there is a lot of public access( sorta a small park area I guess )right in town.  It's across from the hardware store, I believe.  Anyhoo, try drifting there for some bows.  You won't even need waders, let alone a boat.  Goodluck.  Oh, and down the road at the Gas Station / Variety Store there was some public access too.  (  Oooops, sorry for the double post below.  Not sure how to remove )"
