175628,TJQ,2008-03-24 17:47:00,7806,"For the last two weeks, I have been building what I hope to eventually be (its a two - three year project) the biggest database of fishing links available.  have a look!  http://www.fishingsportshow.com  I'd be interested in any comments about how to make it better, and any features I should include, for a more global audience."
175630,John,2008-03-24 17:54:00,2956,Kewl.........  Are you talking Globally demographically or Globally geographically?
175633,TJQ,2008-03-24 17:58:00,7806,Globally geographically
175642,shane,2008-03-24 18:20:00,652,I always suspected that there were other fishing sites out there. Thanks for this.  Bookmarked already.  Oh!  and the site looks good too. Well set up and easy to find my way around which is good for the non-computer types like me.
175649,Clampet,2008-03-24 18:24:00,1947,"By George, I think you got it!!  "

175686,Hedfish,2008-03-24 19:45:00,76,Nice web-site! Bookmarked. Good luck with it!
175697,grt1,2008-03-24 20:13:00,638,currently under development is the new web page for the Red Lake Fall Classic . take a look at    redlakefallclassic.com  you might think about adding web pages for the ontario tournaments so we could see what is going on out there.
175703,TJQ,2008-03-24 20:30:00,7806,"Ive got a tourney section, as soon as I get two or more links in a category, i uxually give it tis own section."
175729,Reelpro,2008-03-24 21:34:00,73,"TJ  Site looks great.  I see you have my Charter business listed, so it must be great!  lol  Maybe a section for ""Regulations and Licences""  It seems we need to carry a briefcase full of documents nowadays, to go on a hunting and fishing weekend. A lot of people new to the great outdoors and its sports have a hard time catching up with all the regs.  I see a lot of questions on sites trying to find out about trailers, boats registraion. Licencing questions.  Buying used boats/motors etc.  fishing regs, seasons, areas etc.  maybe a list of links to gov't depts, and info on such.  [emailÂ protected]"
175759,muskymike,2008-03-24 22:39:00,772,Looks Great TJ. How do we make recommendations on other links that should be on there? I know another guide that maybe could fit in?????
175781,TJQ,2008-03-24 23:30:00,7806,"On every page there is an add link... link... its wide open to everyone.  no cost.  If you do link back though, you get higher placement on the page."
175973,bpsbassman,2008-03-25 03:23:00,941,I gotta add the Canadian Toonie Tournament Series!! Looks promising TJ.
