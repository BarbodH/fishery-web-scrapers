175811,darsky,2008-03-25 00:09:00,586,Real happy to see them up by 2 early
175816,muskymike,2008-03-25 00:13:00,772,GO LEAFS GO!    At least we are consistent. That counts for something.
175826,Mike the Pike,2008-03-25 00:19:00,3421,Not sure they will win tonight Darren Ottawa usually beats Montreal.  Well we will see. Even if it is 3-0 habs it aint over till its over
175844,kemper,2008-03-25 00:40:00,2232,Who cares about hockey. The trout are biting.
175861,darsky,2008-03-25 00:56:00,586,lol!!!!!!!! .............says a probable Leafs fan
175863,kemper,2008-03-25 00:58:00,2232,"Darsky, go to the casino. I think you are lucky today! haha"
175879,bucktail,2008-03-25 01:15:00,1857,"Montreal seams to be firing on all cylinders but a nagging thought in my head says you have to lose before you win i all. I know its 6-1 montreal, but Ottawa has been there and many good teams cranck it up when it matters. Are the Sens that bad or are they lazy????"
175891,darsky,2008-03-25 01:29:00,586,Real funny and ironic that you say that Kemper as I am up 1800.00 in the last 2 days.
175894,lookinforwalleye,2008-03-25 01:33:00,4399, How about 7-1  Nah nah nah nah hey hey hey good bye!
