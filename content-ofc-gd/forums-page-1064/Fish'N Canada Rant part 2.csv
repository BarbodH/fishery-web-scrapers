170454,bassman,2008-03-12 19:14:00,384,"Guys,  Just an FYI, I think we can put the first post to rest. I did receive a couple of PM's from Mike Miller, and even though the prize thing was not the fault of FNC, which I totally agreed with Mike's argument, he has taken the liberty of making amends. He has offered to donate a couple of prizes.  In the spirit of this board, whatever prizes I receive will be donated to the auction/charities that we promote on this site.  To the mods, can you please let me know which auction/charities I should donate to, and who I would contact for that.  I'm glad to see that this has been closed, and I look forward to watching Fish'N Canada this weekend.  Thanks Mike!!!"
170457,fishinggeek,2008-03-12 19:18:00,325,"Good to hear, and way to go Mike for pitching in, despite being not at fault!  Too bad I'm not a registered charity."

175715,bassman,2008-03-24 21:03:00,384,"Just to follow up, I did receive a nice prize pack from Mike Miller today, and as promised, I will donate the prizes to an OFC charity drive. I'm not exactly sure who on the board is involved with any of the drives, but please PM with your contact info.  Thanks to Mike and the gang at Fish'N Canada for their generosity.  Cheers!"

Gerritt, forward everything to me.  Great to see they came through, maybe some people will sway back to the show now that they have shown they care about the viewers and their opinions.  Well done FNC"
