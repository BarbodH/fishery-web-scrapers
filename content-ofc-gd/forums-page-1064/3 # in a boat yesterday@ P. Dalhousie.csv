175339,pikehunter,2008-03-23 22:23:00,1659,Wife and I went down to the casino yesterday afternoon to make a small donation and dropped by Pt. Dalhousie on the way home to watch the fishing action. A few guys were shore fishing and out in the harbour was a Jonboat with 3 on board. As they drifted past us I saw the middle guy catch something? Couldn't distinguish what from our vantage point but it appeared to be a decent size. Whatever it was it had fins and scales and is back in the water happily swimming around again.   Could it have been a Steelhead or a Brown? Maybe the guys on the boat are OFC members?  While I'm rambling on about Pt. D. does anyone here fish 16 mile or 18 mile Creeks in the Niagara area? I was thinking about maybe trying it this week one day or Pt. D.

175353,BillM,2008-03-23 23:03:00,17367,"Most likely a brownie..  When I used to live in St.Catharines, my oldman and I would use roe under floats for browns during this time of the year..."
175382,Casey123,2008-03-24 00:31:00,461,"15 mile and 16 mile are pretty muddy, 18 mile has a great sucker run, never seen any Steelies there, but havent really tried.  20 mile has a great run, upper portion, open after April 26, 2008 - depends on water level."
175406,pikehunter,2008-03-24 01:15:00,1659,"Thanks for your help. Maybe I'll try Port Dalhousie for some Browns one of these days.  So that would be the reason there were no cars parked along the service road at these creeks yesterday. I know that I have seen many cars parked there before however I don't remember what season I have seen them, guess it must have been after opening day."
175439,charlied,2008-03-24 02:20:00,584,could have been either....they have been catching them all winter....a week ago 3 of us got 9 rainbows and 1 brown drifting in the boat there.
175440,ehg,2008-03-24 02:25:00,2666,"I'm up on the north shore of L. Ontario, not south shore P. Dalhousie way. Like to try there some day."
175574,CLofchik,2008-03-24 16:16:00,854,"Had to get the motorcycle out of storage with all the nice weather we've had this weekend, ended up stopping by most of S. shore trout spots.  Those were probably rainbows at Pt.D, more of them being caught than browns.  Action hit or miss, they're either active or not.      Queenston was doing pretty good do, Fifty & Jordan were dead."
