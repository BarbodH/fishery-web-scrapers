175030,Sinker,2008-03-23 01:16:00,8692,"  That is something you should think about before purchasing a home beside a lake access!!!! I know if I was going to buy a home next  to an access, I would EXPECT to be cleaning up after fisherman. As a matter of fact, I'd prolly be out there shooting the $hit with them......telling them to keep it clean.  Like has been said, the access was there long before any homes were put there.......if you don't  like the garbage and noise......there's lots of homes for sale elsewhere!!!!!  Its people like you that get our accesses shut down.....!  Sinker"
175103,lookinforwalleye,2008-03-23 05:00:00,4399, So let see if I understand correctly. You are suggesting that if property owners don`t like people throwing their trash and pissing in front of their properties they should move. If thats what your saying that is just ridiculous and is probably one of the silliest things I have ever read on OFC.  For the record I like to fish Simcoe and I do have a boat which means I use the boat ramps/access points and when I am finished for the day I bag my trash and throw it in a bin if available if there is not a bin available I take it home. The problem is not with property owners my friend the problem is with the pigs who have no respect for other peoples property and that is one of the reason why we are losing access points and parking privleges.
175116,Terry,2008-03-23 11:04:00,14456,I think the point is if you  buy there you do have to expect some problems  there used to be garbage cans everywhere for the guys to put garbage in..almost all of them are gone....  most of the home owners are complaining about the parking and the noise and this is where the home owners should have no right to complain..if you buy beside an airport  expect noise..if you live beside a boat ramp expect people to park and launch boats and run there motors and run noisy atvs and skidoos...they removed most of the parking spots they removed the toilets that use to be there and the garbage cans...I believe that they are doing everything they can so people drop there garbage and piss on the side of the road so they can complain and get them to sell the the access points..it is part of there plan...........
175117,Vanselena,2008-03-23 11:08:00,269,"Until Fishermen are willing to band together and fight these changes instead of saying ""woe is me"" you can expect to see more and more loss of fishing and access rights."
175170,hawkeye,2008-03-23 14:25:00,162,"Sad to see my tax dollars hard at work. This council hasn't much listened to anyone over the years that I have been here.  Yet they claim that they need business, so lets continue to do all we can to remove lake access, and while we are at it we can build another eye sore and bottomless pit of tax dollars like Mt Grossi  For those who do not live here Bob Grossi is the mayor of Georgina. His most recent accomplishment is a huge hill of fill removed from sewer diggings on the side of Woodbine Av on the way to Sutton. Supposed to be a recreational park. Well the fill was wet as in frozen. Last year it started to thaw and made the hill unstable so the park's on hold. Next they tried to dewater the hill but the water is contaminated so there's no where to put it, so there it sits and sits sucking up tax dollar after tax dollar. Seems OK to waste money on this eyesore but when it comes to improving access to the best resource we have no thanks."
175401,Northernpike,2008-03-24 01:05:00,3,You can do something. Phone your councillor and tell them you don't want public lakefront sold off to private interests. You've got until Tuesday at 7 pm.
175492,Sinker,2008-03-24 06:39:00,8692," No, that's not what I""m saying at all.  BEFORE these people purchase waterfront property beside PUBLIC ACCESS, this is something they should think about, because it is going to happen! There are slobs everywhere........same deal if you buy a house beside a park.......you'll have people tossing garbage all over......what are YOU going to do......close the park?  I see it all the time on the lakes I fish as well.......homeowners complaining that fisherman are leaving garbage and making too much noise, early in the morning.......well........why did you buy a  house right beside the most popular boat launch on the lake? DUH.......so they rally to close the boat launch.......  These access points were there before they bought the property.......  People with that mentality get my blood boiling.  Sinker"
175518,Terry,2008-03-24 12:21:00,14456,"and my point, I believe they took the garbage cans away and took away much of the parking to help make the problem worst, so they would have more reason to shut them down"
175529,kennyman,2008-03-24 12:46:00,737,"Yeah, that sucks. I can relate. The people of Sparta Ontario almost shut down their dragstrip(St. Thomas Dragway).The track has been there for at least forty or fifty years and as newbies built homes in and around the track they complained about noise etc.    DUH!! . It's one thing if a new track was trying to go in and residents didn't want it. I can understand that. But to build somewhere where there is a pre-existing track and then whine seems ridiculous. The whiners almost won,but the track made concessions and doesn't open until noon. Maybe the cottagers will win in all of Ontario and we'll have to pay them to get on the lake and fish only after noon. I'm sure the incoming cash influx from accesibility to the lake in varous areas well overrides the cost to the township to clean it up, but that's a very hard to prove. Someone has to step in and lock up any pre-existing access points,parkland etc. before one by one we are all shut out them permanently.This all goes back to whose water this is. It should all be accessible to every resident of Canada. How will we ever care about our greatest and most valuable treasures,our natural resources, if we have no access to them?"
175532,Terry,2008-03-24 12:54:00,14456,"ok does anyone know the law now the the town is selling the land could we take them to court because we have had a right of way to the lake at that spot for years, that we infact have the legal right to keep accessing the lake at that same location... we would need a large group of people to help with the cost..wonder if people would be interested in this"
175694,bigbuck,2008-03-24 20:05:00,2449,"Asking most people for money for something like this would be a waste of time!! It would cost tens of thousands of dollars to fight with good legal representation. People care up until you ask them for some money, once that happens, they tend to disappear and not be heard from again. It's unfortunate but it is human nature."
175700,bbog,2008-03-24 20:21:00,665,What about the OFAH? I'm sure many here are members and OFAH is suppose to work for the membership. Does anyone here have the ear of the OFAH and would make it known (if it isn't already) that representation is required at the meeting tomorrow?
175714,Northernpike,2008-03-24 20:59:00,3,Apparently Georgina's politicians can't read. Someone should phone them and read this to them.  Town of Georgina Official Plan  2.4.2.4 “To continue to pursue a program of securing additional lakefront lands through ownership and/or easements to increase the opportunities for public access to the Lake Simcoe waterfront…”  Town of Georgina Leisure Services Master Plan 7.6.1 “Georgina residents indicated that Lake Simcoe is one of the Town’s greatest assets. Currently the lake contributes to the life that they enjoy. One of the key issues… is the lack of access.”  “…the Town should acquire lands or easements to provide increased public access to the lake.”  “there is a desire for the Town to continue to pursue a program of securing additional lakefront lands in order to increase the opportunities for public access to Lake Simcoe…”  Recommendations: “Seek to acquire waterfront land” “provide increased public access to the lake”
128893,Fish Fin-atic,2007-11-01 17:34:00,1,"Hi, I'm new on this forum, was directed here from the fishinglakesimcoe site where it seems nobody cares about their rights to access the lake - go figure.  Thanks to Chrominator13 for the link, thanks for the form letter mooseroo, here's my twist on it, if there's anything anyone thinks I need to change or add, please advise, and if anyone knows other addresses to send this out to, please let me know.  Otherwise, feel free to modify and use it for your own letters everyone.  Attention: Roland Chenier                                                                                    Thursday, November 1, 2007 Town Clerk 26557 Civic Centre Road RR#2 Keswick, Ontario L4P 3G1  Regarding the proposed by-law to stop up and close a portion of Raines Street and authorize its sale as well as the sale of the Roches Point dock and adjacent water lot. Dear Mr. Chenier,  Please accept this letter in opposition to the proposed by-law to stop up and close a portion of Raines Street and the sale of said property, and in particular, the Roches Point Dock, and the adjacent water lot.  I have been using this this public land to access Lake Simcoe for the purpose of fishing and boating since my earliest memories, as has my father before me. This public access is routinely used for this purpose (and has been used as such for over a century thanks to Canadian citizen's federal tax dollars) The removal of said access point would  be a great loss to the community, most businesses in the area, and the sport fishing community both within Keswick/ Georgina, as well as those who of us who travel to this destination from further abroad.  Under the posted notices the land is described as ""surplus land"", implying there is more land there than is needed; that cannot be further from the truth.   The Roches Point dock is one of the few remaining public lake access points on the south side of Lake Simcoe, and every year it seems there are more restrictions to accessing these points.  It seems the lakeshore properties have been sold to the highest bidder with no regard for the public interest.  Let us not forget that Lake Simcoe has been available for general public access since the retreat of the last glaciers.  Only recently have a handful of people (no doubt with strong political influences) been allowed to build properties on it's banks and exclude others from ""trespassing on their land""  forcing the general public to rely on the ever-decreasing lake access points available; what right do these few people have to prevent the general population from accessing this water body?  Multiple public access points to Lake Simcoe are a necessity, and should be everybody's right as a Canadian and Ontario citizen, not a whimsical political decision to be made lightly. Please note my vehement objection to this preposterous by-law.  If there is anything else I can do to prevent this proposed by-law from passing, please don't hesitate to contact me.  Sincerely,"
128896,lunkerbasshunter,2007-11-01 17:36:00,2585,"that sucks, hope they know what they are doing  CHeers!"
128900,ccmtcanada,2007-11-01 17:45:00,7971,"Fish Fin-atic....very eloquently spoken!  I just recently acquired my first boat, and although I have not fished Simcoe before, I would like to in the future!  thanks for taking the time to write here on OFC"
129404,ranger520vx,2007-11-02 21:25:00,164,Fish-Fin-atic-welcome to a board that cares a little more. Im Chrominator13 on the FLS board. It seems that the date of the next Meet & Greet is more important then access to this lake.  I will make the most of the bank holiday on November 12th by fishing in the morning then attending the Council meeting in the evening.  I've received 4 letters from members here to date.
174857,Northernpike,2008-03-22 14:21:00,3,The Town will be voting on this Tuesday Mar. 25 at 7 pm. Staff has recommended that they sell it!!!! Your letters and mine do not appear in the staff report to Council. Apparently Council never got to see them! Residents of the dictatorship of Georgina should be outraged!!
174861,Terry,2008-03-22 14:39:00,14456,"yup, instead  for more access they are doing everything they can to stop people from accessing Lake Simcoe...it's a real shame and shame on the town of Georgina"
174906,Guest lundboy,2008-03-22 16:23:00,0," As far as getting your boat into Simcoe, you would have to pay to use a ramp at one of the marinas around the lake (which are getting fewer and fewer).  This particular spot would not be suitable for boat launching or parking of trailers.  This spot is great for local kids to fish from however, and for winter access to the water.  By removing this public access the town is just taking away another venue for the local kids, which will just give them one more reason to hang around and cause trouble somewhere else.  Far too often the short sightedness for short term monetary gain, gets into the heads of the local council ""Gods"".  Unless you have a paid membership to one of the 10-20 ""private beaches"" located around the lake in Georgina, you will be out of luck soon.  It's a shame actually, Simcoe has far too few public access points already.  One less is not good."
174963,Mike Pike,2008-03-22 19:19:00,1332,"All the petitions in the world, including those that mention how much you and your children enjoy access to the lake, will amount to nothing more than a hill o' beans.  The residents have spoken and their politians have listened.  Despite the fact that the residents bought their homes by the lake where traditionally there has been parking and access, now they want those areas closed off, sighting garbage and noise, etc..  Probably the same garbage and noise that was there when they bought their properties.  There is garbage along the side of our highways so I guess we should just shut them down too.  Oh well, they want the lake to themselves and they shall have it.  I hope there is enough of a local economany to sustatin those businesses around the lake because there will be no money coming from the outside anymore.  But I'll bet they don't care because many residents work outside the town and don't depend on toursits dollars to keep their own household incomes going.  We're being shut out.  So, to the reisdents of Lake Simoce, you can have your lake.  I don't wanna go anywhere I'm not wanted."
174998,lookinforwalleye,2008-03-22 22:37:00,4399,While I enjoy fishing on Simcoe a few times every year and I will be sorry to see another entry point taken away I understand the frustration of the local residents it is disgusting to see the filth that some people leave behind. I know if I had a property near an access point and had to put up arseholes pissing on my lawn and throwing their garbage were ever they please I would be supporting a access ban.
175008,Terry,2008-03-22 23:43:00,14456,"yeah, but the lake access spots where there long before houses where there..just cottages where all around the lake...I hate it when people move into an area that has lake access or a smelly factory, knowing they are there then complains about the people using the lake access or complain about the smell of the factory..........."
175011,lookinforwalleye,2008-03-23 00:04:00,4399,"yeah,yeah but the fact still remains I would not want trash left on my property and I would assume you would not either."
