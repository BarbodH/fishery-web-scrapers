175322,tjsa,2008-03-23 21:14:00,1578," 45.............is that all??? Oh crap, I cannot remember 45  Something to note:  Aries, The Ram March 21 to April 20  Traditional Aries Traits  Adventurous and energetic Pioneering and courageous Enthusiastic and confident Dynamic and quick-witted  On the dark side...  Selfish and quick-tempered Impulsive and impatient Foolhardy and daredevil  I am an Aries also, but I do not follow any of the traits above at all,   , my b-day is coming up soon, within 2 weeks, but I ain't telling youse guys when exactly it is.  Have a good one Wayne, hope you can still blow out all the candles on the cake."
175326,Terry,2008-03-23 21:29:00,14456,have a great one Wayne and remember you are only as old         as the woman you feel

175337,pikehunter,2008-03-23 22:11:00,1659,"I owe John a happy belated! Hope you had a good one  And TJSA a happy B. Day in advance. I beg to differ with you about not showing any Aries traits. Sometimes we just don't see things in ourselves. Or in the case of an Aries, we are just too foolhardy to admit it.  Thanks for the well wishes folks. And Wayne, you have to go out and buy your brother and sister bikes now that she reminded you of her disappointment on that Easter day so, so ,so many years ago."

LOL  Thanks everyone!  Can't complain about the day... well other than doing a set of company books and CRA/MOF T2/CT23 forms today. It is a good present that they're done... just won't be a good day if they bounce back !!
