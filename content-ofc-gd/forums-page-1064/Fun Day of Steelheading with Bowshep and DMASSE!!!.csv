176054,bowshep,2008-03-25 12:34:00,378,Last year l noticed that it was always difficult to get all the colours around the rainbows Head. On the side shots because of the way the light reflects off the fish.. but making the Rainbows head be the focal point you are able to get all of the colours. Yes Mikes fish looks bigger than Daves but l did nottake that pic... Daves fish looked just as good as Mikes and was even bigger...  Ken
