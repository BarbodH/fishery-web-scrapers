Ice conditions where pretty good. No snow or slush on the ice.Decided to take the truck out and cover some more water then we usually do. First place we stopped I managed to entice a small laker with the williams. We just didnt have the fish marking on the finder so we moved on. next place was a bit deeper and had lots of fish moving through. I managed another little one on the spoon. My buddy Dan was working a tube jig when he got smashed.  As the fish came to the hole I noticed it had about a 6-8"" laker hanging out of its mouth as well as the tube jig. what a pig! Too bad the little laker fell out, would have made for a cool pic.It was a great fight and ended up being about 5-6lbs range. quick pic and back she goes. Again it slowed so we moved to a steep drop off. I landed 2 more smaller lakers this time on the tube. we missed a few more, all and all not to bad of a day. we had no minnows, but saw most people were using minnows with success.  One thing I did notice was the fish had parasites all over them,and this is the second lake in the region I have seen this. I tried to take pics but they didnt turn out all that well. The parasite's almost looked like little magots around the fin areas of the fish. What are these?           "

Seven species infest these fish. Salmincola carpionis attach to the mouth of Arctic charr (Figure 13); S. corpulentus to the gills of lake cisco and broad and lake whitefish; S. edwardsii to the gills of Arctic charr and lake trout, and rarely to the fins of Arctic charr (Figure 14); S. extensus to the fins of Arctic and least cisco and lake and broad whitefish; S. lotae to the mouth of burbot; S. nordmanni to the gills of Figure 11. Adult female Coregonicola orientalis, without egg sacs, attached to a lake whitefish (photo credit J.D. Reist). Figure 12. Coregonicola orientalis from a lake whitefish. Note large star-shaped bulla (photo credit L.M.J. Bernier). 16 inconnu; and S. thymalli to the gills of Arctic grayling and inconnu. Salmincola have free-swimming larvae that attach themselves to the outer surface of the fish. These larvae move and shed (molt) their outer surface several times before maturing to adults. During the final larval stage the larger female attaches itself permanently to the fish using a large, circular anchor or bulla. Sexual reproduction occurs during this stage Figure 13. Salmincola carpionis in the mouth of an Arctic charr (photo credit L.M.J. Bernier). Figure 14. Salmincola edwardsii on the gills of an Arctic charr. (photo credit D.B. Stewart). 17 or as an adult. The tiny male then disappears, and the female remains to feed on gill and/or skin tissue and to shed eggs into the water from her two egg sacs. The adult females are typically about a centimetre in body length. Heavy Salmincola infestations can lead to secondary infections that kill the fish. Some lake trout have over 50 S. edwardsii on their gills and Arctic charr over 20 S. carpionis in their mouths."
