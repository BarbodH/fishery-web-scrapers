174891,JustinHoffman,2008-03-22 15:46:00,482,"Hello All,  With my position with Kistler rods firmed up, I'm now in the market for purchasing all new reels this year. I've narrowed my choices down to Shimano, Quantum and BPS. I love the feel of the BPS Johnny Morris Signature Series reels, but have not had a chance to do any on-the-water testing with them as of yet. Any members of the board own one of these, and if so, what did they like or dislike about them? With the work I do for BPS, I've been fortunate to own many of their products and have always been impressed with the quality and design. Just wondered about this reel. (Plus, with them being on sale right now, now would be my best time to buy..)  The other lines I am thinking about are the Shimano (Citica's and Curado D's) and the Quantum (Accurist and Energy PT's)  I'll probably be going with one line across the board...  Decisions, decisions....  Thanks in advance.  Good Fishing,  Justin"
174893,Roy,2008-03-22 15:49:00,13728,I've been looking at the Johnny Morris reels as well. I'd also be interested in our members' feel for them.

174897,eye-tracker,2008-03-22 16:08:00,89,"Hello Justin,  With Kistler rods being so light I would figure you would want match them up with Shimano Core or Chronarch Mg reels , as standard reels would just do no justice to the weight reduction of the Kistler blank.  Think of it like owning a Ferrari and putting $50 tires on it from Candian Tire.  Looking forward to seeing some of your rods this season...  -sheldon"
174899,danbo,2008-03-22 16:09:00,2646,There's 63 reviews on the link..sounds OK.
174903,JustinHoffman,2008-03-22 16:19:00,482,"Danbo - Thanks for the heads up on the reviews. I had actually read up on most of them previous, but was hoping for some more ""personal"" reviews from actual members here on the board that had used them.  Sheldon - I would say the Core is a little out of my price range. The Chronarch is a bit more doable, but was hoping for something slightly less expensive. The BPS reels are supposedly quite light in weight (low profile, titanium), and I'd be curious to find out what the actual difference is between these and some of the ""higher"" end stuff. I know what you are saying in terms of the rods. Just want to see what my options are... And feel free to check out the Kistler's anytime you want - I'll have a bunch here. I imagine I'll be seeing you at the Carp show, also...  Good Fishing,  Justin"
174905,eye-tracker,2008-03-22 16:21:00,89,"Justin, Chronarch Mg is 5.9oz  -s"
174909,muskymike,2008-03-22 16:25:00,772,"I have a Chronarch Mg on a St. Croix. You dont even realize its on the rod. Dont know much about the Kistler Rods, but if they are that light, you cant go wrong with that reel. I love it."
174915,JustinHoffman,2008-03-22 16:43:00,482,"Hey Guys,  Just found some info on reel weights:  Shimano Chronarch Mg -                5.9 oz Shimano Core 100Mg -                   6.081 oz Shimano Core 100MgFv -                6.73 oz Shimano Curado-D -                      7.4 oz Shimano Chronarch 100A -             7.9 oz Shimano Chronarch SF -                 8.4 oz BPS Johnny Morris Elite -                 8.6oz Shimano Chronarch 100B -             9.0 oz BPS Johnny Morris Signature -         9.4 to 9.6 oz Quantum Energy PT -                      9.5 oz Shimano Citica D -                          9.9 oz  Hmmm, the plot thickens...  Good Fishing,  Justin"
174942,trapshooter,2008-03-22 18:33:00,1234,"Hey Justin,  I have a chronarch Mg on a crankbait rod and just love it.  It's very smooth and sooo light.  Casts like a dream.  I'm a shimano snob though.  I've seen guys at the lodge burn out drags on Quantum stuff in one season but I've heard they have made improvements lately.  I'm adding a 201Curado DHSV this year to my line-up.  I agree with sheldon though, those Kistler rods are begging you for some top of the line reels!  Happy shopping!"
174957,Roy,2008-03-22 19:06:00,13728,I'm due for a decent walleye rod and those Kistlers look and sound pretty good but I think I'll ask my Bud Spiel to make me one if he has the time.
174972,Garry2Rs,2008-03-22 19:53:00,1425,"Hi Justin; I have two Johnny Morris Signature reels.  These reels change a little each year, mine are circa 2005. The reels are of good quality.  They feel strong, and are velvety smooth for normal casting.  I prefer the Chronarch for pitching, but have never had a problem with the BPS reels.  Frankly, I would rank them below the Chronarch SF. On the other hand they cost about half as much as a Chronarch. Garry2r's"
174976,Roy,2008-03-22 20:15:00,13728,"Good evaluation, Garry. Coming from you, I know it's not just hearsay but advice from someone who knows reels. Thanks."
174979,JustinHoffman,2008-03-22 20:53:00,482,"Thanks for the insight, guys...  I think I'll pick up a couple of Johnny Morris's - for the price and quality I have heard about, you can't really lose. I'll also look into a Chronarch or two...  Good to hear the reels have served you well, Garry. Good news for sure.  Good Fishing,  Justin"
175091,bpsbassman,2008-03-23 03:57:00,941,"Justin, I've had one for about four years and just picked up my second one.  My son has had one for a number of years and just picked up anothere one as well.  My brother has one as well as my buddy.  Everyone has nothing but good to say about them. Nicest reel I've ever owned, smooth as silk.  I must say that I also picked up a Curado last year and have nothing but good to say about it as well."
175241,mrpike,2008-03-23 18:10:00,151,I am thinking of getting the STEEZ REEL  ( spinning ) . What's the word on the water about this reel. IS it worth the money  or is it all about the price. I know it it so light and feels great but does it perform like a five hunder dollar reel should . WHAT'S THE WORD FROM THE POEPLE IN THE KNOW !  THanks  Keith.
175262,Garry2Rs,2008-03-23 18:53:00,1425,"Hi there Mr. Pike; You might want to start a new topic for the Steez Spinning reel, just so that more people see your question. I have only read reviews, but the consensus is that it's a wonderful reel. Personally I think the point of diminishing returns on spinning reels is around $150 - $175.00. In other words around the Shimano Stradic... Unlike casting reels, where additional dollars pay for closer tolerances etc, spinning reels are not complicated machines. Also personally, I wouldn't invest in a high-end Daiwa reel... In Canada, Shimano has their head office and repair depot in Peterborough. Daiwa closed their Canadian facilities a number of years ago. That's not to say that there are no parts or service, but you're dealing with a third party. I doubt that Rocky's Reel Repair is going to have parts in stock for such a rara aves."
175643,Mike01,2008-03-24 18:21:00,378,I have been using the Johnny Morris reel for a few years now and I find it to be on par with other high end reels.
175668,fishindevil,2008-03-24 19:01:00,6254,"I as well have a johnny morris,and for 2 yrs have put it through some very serious fishing and im impressed its still very smooth,and a very good sensitive drag too,i will buy another no problem,im sure mine is 10bearing too,well worth the price...."
175744,steverowbotham,2008-03-24 22:04:00,1800,"As an employee of bass pro, i bought one of them, and i like it, but its not the best.  Curado is where its at"
175746,Abberz,2008-03-24 22:08:00,140,"I've used the Morris a bit, but I prefer the Quantum Energy PT's or Tour PT's personally.  Better value for your money in my opinion."
