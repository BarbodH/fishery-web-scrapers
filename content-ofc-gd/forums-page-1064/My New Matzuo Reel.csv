175036,nancur373,2008-03-23 01:33:00,1211,Hey guys. I just bought a new spinning reel at Canadian Tire. It's a Matzuo America MT2840. I never used one of these before but it was on sale for 29.99. Reg. price 59.99. It has 8 ball bearings and a drilled aluminum spool. Anyone have any experience with these. I'm just a once a month fisherman for pike and pickeral and the odd bass and wondewring if this will last me a while. Thanks guys.

175067,SlowPoke,2008-03-23 02:25:00,2984,I don't know anything about that peticular reel but I will say one thing; the lower budget reels of today are arguably better than anything produced 10-15 years ago when we were paying hundreds of dollars for one. It will undoubtedly give you years of service. -Brian

I just moved up here from Newfoundland last year so my little trout rod was insufficient but it did bring in my first pike at 28 inches then the reel took a dump. I'm hoping for 20 degrees all week.
175128,JEREMY,2008-03-23 12:40:00,300,"I hope you have a better experiance with it than i did.I was fighting a fish and somthing broke in the spool ,so i emailed them never got a reply.After waitng a month or so i went to ct asked the guy in the sports area how to get a hold of them and he just sent me to a guy that repairs reels.Also when i emaled them i made it clear i did not want something for free i was willing to pay for a new spool. Now i will not buy anything that says matzuo on it."
175138,Dondorfish,2008-03-23 13:19:00,1000,  Hey Jeremy - here's the link to their website. Click on customer service at the bottom of the home page:   http://www.matzuo.com/   It also has the company 1-800 number    Don
175508,JEREMY,2008-03-24 11:53:00,300,"Thanx tracker ,when i click on the customer service link it tells me to update my tool bar for some reason.I hate technology."
175521,pikehunter,2008-03-24 12:26:00,1659,"That is interesting...I clicked on the customer service link, it took a minute but it did come up as an email link. When clicking the buy wholesale link it comes up instantly as a new page. Guess selling might be a tad more important than giving a description of what their service is about. But at least I did get something other than a toolbar popup.  Have fun with your new reel and remember, pictures!"
175542,nancur373,2008-03-24 13:52:00,1211,Went to put it on my rod yesterday and it won't fit. base too wide. I guess I need a bigger rod.
175616,wallyboss,2008-03-24 17:26:00,1095,"8lbs XL should be okay , but what kind of rod are you putting this on that it won't fit.  Base of spinning reels are pretty standard. Not sure about Matzuo though, I would pay a bit more  and get a known name first."
175787,nancur373,2008-03-24 23:45:00,1211,Actually i busted the reel holder on my rod and didn't realize. So I kept my old reel on it with a couple zip ties. Went and bought a new Shimano 7' Medium Action for the new reel.
