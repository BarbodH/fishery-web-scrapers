175226,Matt C.,2008-03-23 17:32:00,6,"I just wanted to introduce myself as I have been reading your posts for a while now.  I am impressed with the knowledge that everyone openly shares and your friendship for each other.  Those are the two main reasons I am posting... and I don't want to work on my report cards.  I am a Grade 8 teacher from Chatham who usually fishes from shore for perch and crappie  in Lake Erie.  I also always work fishing into the vacation when I go to Myrtle Beach, the Florida Keys or Manitoulin Island.  This summer I think we are going out east for a few weeks. Thanks in advance for all the help as I am looking for a boat and I am certain to have questions over the next few weeks about that and other matters. Matt C."
