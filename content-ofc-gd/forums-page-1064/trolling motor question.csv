175589,JorgeCarlos,2008-03-24 16:33:00,109,"12v 55 lb thrust on a 19.5 footer tahoe boat, will be enough to move around,is a motor guide wireless.  thanks"
175595,Stoty,2008-03-24 16:43:00,2910,I would recommend at least a 75 lb thrust motor for a boat of that size.
175596,lookinforwalleye,2008-03-24 16:43:00,4399,"That motor will have a tough time on a windy day I would think, I know mine does and I  have a smaller/lighter boat."
175615,Mike01,2008-03-24 17:20:00,378,"I have the same motor on my 16' Starcraft.  Its fine for nice days, but when the wind picks up it just dosn't have enough power.  I also hate how it beeps everytime you press the pedal!!!"
175663,Garry2Rs,2008-03-24 18:52:00,1425,"12 volts and 55fp also sounds a little light to me... I have a spare 65fp, 24 volt Minn-Kota cable steer, if you're interested PM me."
175718,silveradosheriff,2008-03-24 21:05:00,1025,"Need some more power, 75 and up.  :-)"
175732,Pigeontroller,2008-03-24 21:43:00,2793,"I agree with the others. I have a 12v 55pd on my 16 footer and its adequate in calm conditions, but underpowered in wind or current. You'll never regret having to much power on the bow!"
175750,taper,2008-03-24 22:20:00,611,"Agree with all the others, I have an 80 on a 17 and a half foot and it works well. Also I would go 24V if you can."
175828,LundGuy,2008-03-25 00:20:00,169,"I used to have a 55 Minn kota on my 18 '6  Lund. It did fine, but could have been better especially on windy days, had to fight the turning. Since then I replaced the 55 with a Terrova 80 on the 18'6 and just bought a 55 Terrova for my 16' Lund, it is plenty for that boat. I would recommend at least the 80 or the 110 for a 19', 24 volt for sure.More is always better than not quite enough.."
175832,OhioFisherman,2008-03-25 00:25:00,6623,"I have an older narrow compared to the newer aluminum boats 16' 8"" with a 12 volt 55 pound thrust motor. You will need a bigger one at the very least 70 pound thrust. A lot easier to turn down the power than not have it."
175836,LeXXington,2008-03-25 00:31:00,1928,Enough has been said on the subject.. Get away from the 12V you need POWER
