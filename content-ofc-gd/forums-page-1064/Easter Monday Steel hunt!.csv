175790,ccmtcanada,2008-03-24 23:47:00,7971,"Well, with the nice weather and me starting to feel a little better from my bout with the flu, we had a few hours this afternoon to head out and fish.  We ended up at one of our good spots at around 1pm and began drifting.  It started out really slow, but it's not often we get to fish during the day, so we stayed out, basking in the sunlight.  I was having lots of line issues today...it seems that when things are going right on the trib, things just run smoothly...almost machine-like.  Today wasn't my day....LOL.  Anyhow, it took over an hour, but bly finally sees her float go down and she says ""Fish on!!"".  After a quick fight, she landed this nice female!   After that fish, I was hopeful that the bite was going to turn on.  A few more line tangles for me and bly says again ""Fish on!"".  This one was an active one...taking multiple runs away from her...then turning on a dime and swimming straight at her.  She did a great job and landed this really nice sized male....   After she landed that one, we began drifting again and we hear ""Bly's kickin' your butt like usual"".  We look up and see a fellow OFNer snickering at us...LOL.  Well, truth be told, she did kick my butt today!!  On the last drift of the day, I hooked into a really nice fish, but it spit the hook after about 2 minutes on.  Oh well...we had to get on home.  Not a bad way to spend a sunny Easter Monday....back to the grind and crappy winter weather tomorrow....LOL."

Made the drive to Bowmanville(sp) Creek for the very first time today, got there after lunch and went 0 for 2. The water visabilty went down hill as the day went on.  Beauty day to be out though."
175867,GNODDY,2008-03-25 01:01:00,163,"You made a good effort Cliff, sorry for the comment but I had too eheheh  Geoff"

175967,Paulus,2008-03-25 03:19:00,522,"Smokin!   Congrats on yet another victory, Bly.  Well buys, I think it's time we put this one on Pro-Line.  Sorry Cliff, but unless you get some new line, my chips are on Bly for the next round!   p.-"
176002,MJL,2008-03-25 06:25:00,2427,"Cliff, out-fishing Carole isn't meant to be.  Women are built different than us.  They have x-ray vision, built in sonar and mind controlling powers to make even the most skilled angler skunk and the most spooked fish bite.  I guess we know who wears the waders in that family.  Top Angling Carole"
176058,snag,2008-03-25 12:39:00,1932,"I agree with MJL.  Carole's beauty and pheromones are irresistible to the fish.  Cliff, I suggest you where something a little more revealing next time. At least you'll catch a sucker  "
176062,Greencoachdog,2008-03-25 12:55:00,8163,  Wouldn't he be cute in something sheer and frilly?
