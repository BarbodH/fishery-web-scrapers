175842,douG,2008-03-25 00:36:00,2693,"This might help.  What Riparian said is true.  Copy the pictures from your camera to a spot that you can find later, in your computer.  Then get into the OFC gallery, or photobucket (better), and upload your pictures from your puter, from that spot you remembered, to the internet.  If your picture can be seen on the internet, it is easy to post it, or link to it, and put it in your OFC post.  If you use OFC to host your pictures, you might need to shrink them first.  Photobucket does this for you.  Send me a pm and I can walk you through it no problem.  The first time was a trick, I remember, but now it is no big deal.  Most members new to this would agree with that."
