The Newfoundlander is tired and just wants to take a nap, so he politely declines and tries to catch a few winks.  The lawyer persists, says that the game is a lot of fun. ""I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me only $5. You ask me one, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500.""  This catches the Newfoundlander's attention and to keep the lawyer quiet, agrees to play the game.  The lawyer asks the first question. ""What's the distance from the earth to the moon?""  The Newfoundlander doesn't say a word, reaches in his pocket pulls out a five-dollar bill, and hands it to the lawyer.  Now, it's the Newfoundlander's turn. He asks the lawyer, ""What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down with four?""  The lawyer uses his laptop, searches all references. He uses the Air phone. He searches the Net and even the Library of Congress. He sends e-mails to all the smart friends he knows, all to no avail. After one hour of searching he finally gives up. He wakes up the Newfoundlander and hands him $500. The Newfoundlander pockets the $500 and goes right back to sleep.  The lawyer is going nuts not knowing the answer. He wakes the Newfoundlander up and asks, ""Well, so what goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four?""  The Newfoundlander reaches in his pocket, hands the lawyer $5 and goes back to sleep."
