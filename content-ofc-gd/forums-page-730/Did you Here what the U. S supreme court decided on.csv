430378,love2fishhave2work,2010-02-06 23:57:00,212,Has anyone heard when the Caucasian Carp is coming.  Those are the ones that scare me.
430382,troutologist,2010-02-07 00:13:00,951,"Let the powers that be know this issue is of utmost importance.  I wrote the MPP and MP of my former home in SSM, further their counter parts in Michigan. I also contacted OFAH to ensure this was on their radar and they were taking lobby action.   These letters need not be lengthy nor hold cited literature, they simply need to convey that this is an issue to critical importance to resource users on both sides of the border. The ramifications of this species in the Great Lakes could be huge.   No one but fishermen/outdoorsmen are going to bat on this one for us. Where are all those tree hugger groups on an actual environmental issue???  Make yourself heard.  At this point it is a lobby battle."
430390,smitter,2010-02-07 00:41:00,106,"I'm certainly not a qualified expert on the subject, but I've seen the videos of these things flying out of the water and clocking boaters in the head. I'm quite fearful of what these fish could do to our Great Lakes fisheries."
430398,cram,2010-02-07 01:03:00,1733, Made me laugh my ass off.  THanks for posting.
430402,cram,2010-02-07 01:12:00,1733,"In all seriousness though, this looks like an environmental catastrophe that's pretty much forecasted unanimously by scientists on both sides of the border.  The only disagreement is whether the economic impact of locking the canal is justified relative to the environmental impact.  Obviously we think its justified....but its pretty hard for a president in his first term of office in one of the largest economic meltdowns in history to say ""hey, lets lock down a pretty vital economic freeway"".  Not saying its justified, but it is hard.  He could be measured in the history books as the guy who ruined the great lakes, but i bet he prefers that risk over the near-term alternative if he does lock the canal."
430460,John Bacon,2010-02-07 03:54:00,3277,Has anybody fished areas that do have asian carp?  Are there still catchable quantities of other fish?  I keep reading how they will eliminate all other fish and be the only species left in the lake or close to it.  Has this actually happened in other areas?  It seems to me that if they so much plankton that there was no food for other fish then there would also be no food for asian carp.  I don't want to imply that we should just let them in; but we always hear about these doomsday predictions for every invasive species that never seem to be such a catostrophe.  They may be a greater danger to boaters than they are to fish.
430467,Twocoda,2010-02-07 04:22:00,4130, i agree ...these things will spawn and im sure our top predetors will evolve to eating them if they have to ....personally i hope this invasion is prevented ...but if its not ....fish are resilient and will adapt to their new menu....  i wonder if there will be restitution from the US if this does get outta hand...
430489,Greencoachdog,2010-02-07 11:36:00,8163, I'm sure there will be!  ... right after y'all pay us retroactive restitution for letting the Sea Lamprey in through the St. Lawrence Seaway!  ... and the Goby.  ... and the Zebra Mussel.
430504,Twocoda,2010-02-07 13:15:00,4130,  it isnt like we were farming them and set them free...they are a product of the shipping industry ...mostly American owned i might add...
430514,Billy Bob,2010-02-07 13:52:00,5865," These are the really smart ones that can't be caught......been around for hundreds of years and no one knew it.. ...you heard fish are in schools, well who do you think was running all these schools...."
430524,Chris,2010-02-07 14:04:00,405,Well at least we know who despises the U.S. now. Muskymatt and others please grow up!!
430528,dickie,2010-02-07 14:13:00,64,Who is this GDC character anyway.
430540,muskymatt,2010-02-07 14:35:00,2608," Never said that and don't put words in my mouth.  Having the worlds longest border, I wouldn't want can't imagine and couldn't think of a better neighbour than the US. Their people are great people(GCD excluded  ) That said it doesn't mean I have to agree with their government policies or everthing they do. ie. softwood lumber  So unless you have something constructive to add why don't you just keep your little personal jabs to yourself!"
430544,Greencoachdog,2010-02-07 14:52:00,8163," Yup!... we raised them up and trained them to hate (fed them poutine until they were sick of it) and attack Canada, then we showed them which way north was and set them free!  ... and if y'all give us any crap at all. we're turning of the electric barrier and you will be doomed!  Now, if you were a little better informed you would know that the carp escaped the farms when the Missippi river flooded over it's banks and into the farms... kinda like a natural disaster thing.    That'll be MISTER GCD to you... and I may be your worst nightmare!"
430573,bigfish1965,2010-02-07 15:35:00,3382,"Remember Dawg...if that barrier goes down, the heavily weeded lakes like Nippissing would be decimated. Lakes like Erie don't have a great deal of vegetation compared to water volume. I think the biggest threat would be to the Kawarthas, Muskokas and Nippissing. We would have to close down the Trent canal for sure....  As far as us letting in invasive species...the ships that dumped their ballast water, did so illegally. I have always wanted a ballast water exchange law for the mouth of the St Lawrence. That could prevent any further issues."
430587,muskymatt,2010-02-07 15:49:00,2608, Actually if I'm not mistake Canada is one of few countries that don't have a law that dumping of ballast water is to be done 200 km from a shipping route water system. Seems a logical thing to have imo  here's some info  http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/mediaroom/releases...-h069e-3272.htm  http://el.erdc.usace.army.mil/zebra/zmis/z..._guidelines.htm
430220,johnston1010,2010-02-06 15:45:00,12,If those suit dummies from the U.S supreme court in there big huge buildings who have never fished a day in there life keep the Chiago canal open the Great lakes could get those stupid Asian carp and the great lakes counect to almost every one of those great small lakes and I will just destroy the Ontaio that we all love.
430224,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-06 15:54:00,2690,"With apologies to Americans on this forum, when has anyone of authority in the US ever cared what happens to Canada?  The sad thing is they will be ruining it for all the American fisherman/women as well."
430226,cram,2010-02-06 15:56:00,1733,Lawsuit time.  100 billion dollars (in my best dr. evil accent)
430229,Paully,2010-02-06 16:06:00,712, Perhaps we can rid the carp with these...     Sharks with freakin lazer beams ..
430237,muskymatt,2010-02-06 16:34:00,2608,"http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicag....aspx?id=153959  The American government doesn't give a rats a$$ about anything other than money , guns and power.......Canada included....not surprising that this decision was made. If it costs some Bureaucrat more paperwork or money then it's not worth the time or effort. "
430240,Greencoachdog,2010-02-06 16:41:00,8163,Asian Carp taste like chicken and there's no limit on them!!!
430250,muskymatt,2010-02-06 17:14:00,2608,"  Americans brought them in through being irresponsible, it's an American problem so keep them and eat your fill......  whey should we have to clean up your garbage?  funny, if it was reversed we'd have hell to pay"
430255,Greencoachdog,2010-02-06 17:32:00,8163,"  Meh! What's one more invasive species in the great lakes?  Canada let all the other ones in... and the U.S. lets one little tiny species in and we're irreresponsible???  ... and if you'll check your facts, they haven't even gotten in yet!"
430259,JMahon,2010-02-06 17:53:00,48,"It's only a matter of time before they do get in!   & yes, Canada did let some invasive species in...but in reality, the kind of damage the zebra muscles & gobies have created is extremely minimal, compared to the damage the asian carp are going to impose on the great lakes!   Say good bye to the ecosystem....not to mention the economy!"
430260,jjcanoe,2010-02-06 17:58:00,744," Problem is that they are plankton feeders and can't be caught with traditional angling methods,  (wheres the youtube vid of the guys in the boat with the net) So all you downrigger guys get practicing tying up #30 plankton flies,  Fly fishers the same!   We'll see the end of the charter industry on the lakes, and basically all Great lakes fishing will be done, costing the Gov'ts of Ontario and All the Great lakes States (including Illinois) BILLIONS of dollars in tax revenue.  The comercial guys will be the only ones able to catch these things.  Very short sighted of these idiots who are pushing papers around..  jjcanoe"
430262,Billy Bob,2010-02-06 18:02:00,5865,"Sounds politically incorrect to be against ""Asian"" carp...don't hear no complaints about European carp..  Maybe you should call them American carp as most hate us until they need they backs covered the U.S.A."
430263,aplumma,2010-02-06 18:13:00,6896,"Sorry folks but even if we close it down any invasive species that has no natural enemies will get into the surrounding water ways. If you look at it the small mouth bass was termed an invasive species, along with the gobies that would kill the system, The carmerans will deplete the feeder fish and the carp will destroy the habitate. Guess what so far the lakes have been able to weather all of the crap we have done to it with out failing. I am not saying that it is good that we test the eco system here but to say it is the because the USA is lazy and doesnt give a damn is crap and it is inflammatory in the least. This thread is in poor taste  and has no direction to go but down.   Art"
430264,Grimace,2010-02-06 18:13:00,2020,"We are not flying, we are falling.  We are just so high up we haven't noticed the grounds getting closer.  At the risk of sounding overly simple.  I know these things are complicated.  Can they not just zap or kill all the fish in this river further down the road.  If the biomass in the water is 85% invasive carp, who cares.  Make a barrier back there and keep the shipping open so all those people do not lose their jobs and those companies do not have to shut down.  Again I am fairly ignorant of the actual area this is going on in, I am sure there is a reason they can't or if it is possible, maybe they are looking into it?"
430265,Greencoachdog,2010-02-06 18:14:00,8163," They say that everytime they discover a new invasive species in the great lakes... back when the gobies and zebra mussels were discovered it was going to be a total collapse of the great lakes.     Same as I stated above... but they can be caught with corn and frozen green peas and regular carp bait!  MJL, Victor, Beans... y'all get your gear ready men!!! We've a big job for y'all to do!"
430269,bigfish1965,2010-02-06 18:21:00,3382,"Is it really that far fetched to ask for some kind of responsible dialogue on this issue? We do not know why the courts ruled as they did since none of us are lawyers. Finger pointing in useless and portraying the issue as little more than an inconvenience is insulting. Our biologists, who have the best record at preserving resources in North America, have identified this issue as one of the highest priority.  I think the issue deserves proper discourse and not this display of immature back and forth."
430272,Billy Bob,2010-02-06 18:27:00,5865, Now I know what to use on my downriggers and Dipsy Divers......  BTW most of what I said earlier is tongue and cheek.......but not all...
430275,Greencoachdog,2010-02-06 18:36:00,8163,"  Yeah, it's not like the U.S. doesn't care or hasn't tried to stop them... the great lakes are our waters too!!!  ... and speaking of insulting, I felt insulted just reading the title to this thread!  Maybe y'all should put up your own barriers on the Canadian side?... would any of the bashers like to chip a few $ for that?"
430276,NAC,2010-02-06 18:38:00,369,It is being tabled for discussion again next week now that Obama realizes the hastiness of his poor decision. I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact the it would forever be his legacy being as the president that knowingly allowed the destruction of the Great Lakes fishery.
430277,Billy Bob,2010-02-06 18:41:00,5865," Yes, he would better be know for GIVING AWAY the farm....."
430280,canadadude,2010-02-06 18:47:00,769,"Dude we don't have Asian carp on the Canadian side so why put up barriers. I do agree the U.S does care because there the ones initiating the closer of Chicago system and they have alot more tourist and use $$$$$$$$ at stake then Canada.I don't think the last word has been herd on this subject, the states bordering the great lakes will be seeing red if this decision is true."
430287,bigfish1965,2010-02-06 19:15:00,3382," Actually the people of Canada (DFO and MNR) have comitted many resources to assist Michigan with its electric barricade. We would put in our own barriers but since the entire canal exists on US soil, there is the whole sovereignty issue."
430332,TJQ,2010-02-06 21:57:00,7806,Dawgs just trolling as usual.. lol.. but at least he's fishing...
430363,Billy Bob,2010-02-06 23:16:00,5865, I'm sure the Obama administration would take all the Canadian donations you are willing to send for this barrier......my guess is we will NOT see a dime.
430364,bigfish1965,2010-02-06 23:19:00,3382, We sent people instead But you did get $13M from your Feds for it all last month.
430368,Billy Bob,2010-02-06 23:28:00,5865,I hope you mean Federal Express......(packages)...
