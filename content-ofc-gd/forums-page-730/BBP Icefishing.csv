430607,Skud,2010-02-07 16:24:00,739,I haven't fished for a couple of weeks now due to work. My last few outings which was two afternoons and a morning caught me only one Whitey. It was that lousy weekend that most complained of the slow action.  Here are a few pics to commemorate my little bit of success.  Sunday Morning sunrise   Whitey caught on a jigging Shad rap   Whitefish Dinner

430953,Spiel,2010-02-08 11:30:00,9065,I suppose with all the mouths to feed at home you'd need 2 whitefish before sending me an invite for dinner.  It does look good though.
