When it was hauled in we discovered a drivers license and a ton of crayfish within. We ended up turning it in to the local OPP station.

It felt big but not really fighting hard. Just going side to side in the current.  I finally get it in close to the bank but it was too far under in the dirty water and all I could see was a big dark shape and it was kind of hung up on some roots or something.  So I gave a good hard pull and it let go of the roots and this big, dark round thing came lunging out of the water right at my feet.  What I saw (or thought I saw) was a giant snapping turtle charging out of the water to attack me!  I started scrambling backwards in the mud and then started slipping and was sliding down toward the thing and was just about to start a full scale, screaming panic when I realized what it really was.  A green plastic garbage can lid.  All covered in algae and mud.  The 'head' was the handle, all jammed full of mud on the side."

It was the most confusing fight ever LOL... First I was snagged....then there was just some weight on the hook when the snag came loose....then as I started to pull in the 40 yards of line I had a huge pull, and a quick fight that lasted long enough to see the bass spit the goby...then I realized the goby was alive and tugging LOL!

408987,lew,2009-12-06 14:27:00,12766,"Waynes story about them catching the 2 x 10 on GBay yesterday reminded me of a similar thing happening to me a few years back while musky fishing on the Upper Niagara River near the Peace Bridge.  We had about 6 boats in our group and we trolled in behind the boat in front of us to get tighter to shore and just as we got in my rod doubled over and the fight was on. It felt like a big fish with plenty of head shakes and she was moving all over the place trying to break free while my rod tip bounced like crazy. During the fight I looked over at the boat beside us and he was also fighting a biggun and I figured this was great with 2 huge fish being fought only a couple hundred feet apart at the same time.  After about a 5 minute fight my line starting coming up and my partner had the Frabil ready to scoop her, but instead of the big slimer I was expecting, all I saw was a large red lure hooked to my bait with the line running over towards the other boat.  Yup, it wasn't a fish at all, but I'd snagged the line of buddy in the next boat when we cut in too close behind them and I tangled lines  Anybody who's fished the river in that location knows what the huge current is like, and with us fighting each other & with the boats bouncing in the waves & current, you may be able to understand what we were experiencing.  Disappointing to say the least, but it's provided plenty of laffs ever since  So howz bout you, what'd you ever catch that turned out to be something other than what you thought it was  ??"
408999,Rizzo,2009-12-06 14:56:00,4754,at least you won the fight! My bizarre catch story is also from the niagara. A few weeks back my buddy hooked in to an anchor. Such a heavy one we had to drag it into the shallows to get it

I those days we'd just jump in and swim to the snag and unhook it. So I did just that. About 50 feet from shore in about 12 feet of water I dove down and there was my red and white daredevil hooked onto a Sears(Ted Williams model) outboard. One of these 2HP with the gas tank on top. I dove down and freed it from the mud and eventually dragged it to the shore. We finally got it home and copied the serial number from it. Went to the Sears outlet in town and asked if they could track down the owner. A few weeks later I got a letter from a fellow in Ohio that said it was his. He wrote that it was a kicker on his boat and it had fallen off that spring while he was  travelling across the lake. He said he had replaced it and that I could have it if I wanted. WOW! After cleaning it up and pelacing the plug it started up no problem. We used it for years and finally sold it so that I could upgrade to a new 4hp Mercury.  muddler"
