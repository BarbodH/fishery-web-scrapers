430517,Leecher,2010-02-07 13:55:00,7832," Thanks Chris!!!  The video was made with Movie Maker that is part of Windows XP.... great little program with a ton of options for the effects.  You can import images, movies and sound tracks  For the music, a little trick is to resize it once it's imported Give it a try Chris, I'm sure you'll get the hang of it pretty quick"
430519,Spiel,2010-02-07 13:58:00,9065," Thanks Jacques. Of course I want it to be a fishing video, Lord knows when that'll be.....LOL"

429944,Leecher,2010-02-05 21:35:00,7832,"Today was my day off work and so is Melissa from school...... so the plan was to hit my favorite lake to see if we could get my daughter into her first walleye.... but first..... the details LOL  When I got up, temperature was -12C and no wind    Left home at 6:30am, made a detour to Tims for some hot refreshments, then gaz for the car and the way we go.... destination Lac St-Marie     Got to destination at 7:30am, temperature was -20C up there    drove on the ice and made a beeline for my honey hole.  Drilled 5 holes and ice was 16""+ thick.  Was in about 12' fow over a weed bed, rigged 3 set lines with dead minnows and since Melissa now has her own jigging rod, rigged it with her favorite lure that she caught her first pike last season, Mr. Champ type spoon and minnow head.  I on the other hand had a Buck Shot tipped with a minnow head.  First fish to land on ice was from Melissa's end on the jigging rod... a whopper 14""+ perch    PB FOR HER    Never seen a perch that big..... that right there made for a very good start.  But alas Melissa did not hook into an eye but she did get another 12"" perch on a set line  She kicked my butt today and I'm very happy that it happen.....  cause that means she will look forward to our next outing together  It was a great time spend on the hard stuff for both of us today... didn't get any golden but my daughter sure got some whoppers All fish were CPVR'd and you probably noticed the V in there..... yes have live release footage of all of them  So without further adieu.... here's the video I made of our time out on the hard stuff Enjoy Leechman  "

430119,Dutchy,2010-02-06 03:42:00,416,"Nice perch, gotta love those jumbos  I have to say though Leechman, I would not have thought you would be a Disturbed fan. Personally I think their great, seen them 5 times in concert. Nice video for sure."
430122,Cudz,2010-02-06 03:49:00,2652,nice work.  I could not help thinking how good those perch would have tasted.

Disturbed has some awesome songs for sure   Thanks Chris!!!  I would keep some but up here, seemed to be infested with parasites    You can actually see them in and around the gill and near their tails.....  that's why I released them"
430351,Radnine,2010-02-06 22:39:00,1538," Well I am glad that you answered that question before I had a chance to ask [why you let them go?]. It warms my heart to see fathers and children get out anywhere together, but fishing in particular. Thanks for taking the time to post it Jacques. I also love the way you speak French to her and English to us (I am not sure why, but I am in awe of people that have that talent). It is posts like this one that make this board great. Jim"
430370,hammercarp,2010-02-06 23:35:00,964,Wow that is one monster perch. Thanks for putting that video together. It put a smile on my face. WTG!
430401,Leecher,2010-02-07 01:08:00,7832," Thanks Jim for your kind comments   much appreciated I love posting reports of our outings together and it's no exception, this one was awesome As for the languages speaking..... we speak both at home and Melissa is getting better at understanding and speaking.... living so close to Ontario borders, bilingualism is a must for us Thanks again Jim!!!  p.s. If you want I could start posting reports in French   Thanks hammercarp!!!  First time seeing a big one like that.... she beat my PB by 2"""
430480,Cudz,2010-02-07 06:07:00,2652,Ecris pas en francais.  J'en ai assez de probleme lire en anglais et c'est ma premiere langue.  lol
430510,Leecher,2010-02-07 13:38:00,7832, OK dix-quatre
430511,Spiel,2010-02-07 13:40:00,9065,"Good job Jacques and Melissa.  I guess I'm gonna have to learn me some of this video editing and posting. I mean Jacques can do it, certainly I can...."
