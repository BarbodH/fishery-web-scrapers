430783,JoshS,2010-02-07 22:04:00,729,"Dumb purchases: 13 ft St croix float rod (first float rod was a wild river, had it fixed at the old Pollacks only to never see it again), Fenwick Walleye Classic crank rod (breaks too easily), various stupid looking plastics for bass that make me laugh looking at them now, crappy spinnerbaits, portable fish finder that takes AA's, crappy waders, etc.  What I now buy instead: Better quality gear. I see no sense in getting mediocre gear only to need to upgrade. If you know what you target and are going to be serious about your hours on the water, get good quality gear!  Example: I've been using my calcutta 250 for over ten years and don't see it ever sitting at home, easy reel to service yourself and works like a beast."
430309,archer379,2010-02-06 20:52:00,277,Lets just say if all your fishing stuff dissapeared poof gone. If you have to replace everthing  what would you start with? What have you bought over the years that you wouldn't have bought? keeping in mind your not loaded with cash.
430312,dks,2010-02-06 21:04:00,36,"I wouldn't have bought a float tube (used it twice),worm blower, knot tyer,LCD fish finder (Vexilar is better),cheap fishing vests,cheap waders,various tackle boxes, solo canoe,inflatable rubber dingy, electric motor, wooden tip ups, ice sleds,and a few other things that I can't think of right now. At least I helped the economy."

A couple Williams Wabler #60 spoons , Rapala Original,Twister Tails and a variety of jigs..single hooks and split shots a bobber or two.. swivels snaps and leaders. All this available @ CTC for about 150.00$ This gets me out every time ..I can catch everything I fish for with the above mentioned items.  RFS "
430315,Syn,2010-02-06 21:12:00,519,I wouldn't have bought $20 Banjo minnow pack lol  or those crappy insensitive red white bulb bobbers. When I switched to thill shy bite long bobber it made a world of difference at catching trout.  I would rebuy shimano reels and high modulus graphite rods instead of cheap rods and reels.  Also I would buy Powerbait. Wasted too much money on regular plastic.  If I could go back in time I would have told myself to buy and use more spinnerbaits rather than buy crankbaits.
430316,scugpg,2010-02-06 21:13:00,1373,alot less lures and more live / gulp alive bait.
430319,backbay,2010-02-06 21:24:00,773,"I would start with something like a Shakespeare Agility 6'6"" with maybe a Pflueger Trion for a lighter spinning rig, a large-arbour Spinning reel, (so many to choose from, it's hard to decide), with a 6'6"" or 7' medium-heavy for a heavier spinning rig, maybe a Rapala R-Type; and an Okuma Guide Select, or a Shimano Cumara 7' medium heavy with a Revo S or SX; a selection of Ralapa HJ14 crankbaits, a couple of Cotton Cordell Big O's, some Rebel Crankbaits, some Senko stuff, Gulp Alive Leeches, and some sort of top water lure for fun.  Then I would wait till the sales started in the spring, and augment as deemed necessary"
430324,BillM,2010-02-06 21:31:00,17367,"Exactly what I have now...  Maybe a longer 7-'7'2 Mh spinning rod for throwing plastics for pike in the spring..  and a long pier rod, other then that nothing would change."
430337,smitter,2010-02-06 22:03:00,106,"One 6'6"" medium action spinning rod and a mess of jig heads for pickerel. Then a 9' 5wt fly rod and some tying material for specks.  I wouldn't buy any cheap crap. Only quality rods and reels. They make fishing more enjoyable and they last longer.  O wouldn't buy any hard plastic tackle boxes. Tackle bags are the way to go IMO."
430520,bucktail,2010-02-07 13:59:00,1857,"Two things I have found essential are a good floater suit, and a nice powerful foot controlled bow mount electric trolling motor."

I wish that was all I had because I would have saved myself thousands."
430556,mbosh1980,2010-02-07 15:10:00,349,"wouldn't have bought cheap rod/reel combos or bargain brand line or discount plastic baits.  Would buy my bps extreme reel again, as well as gulp alive plastics and my rapala topwater cranks."
430565,gdelongchamp,2010-02-07 15:16:00,199,"Last spring our basement got flooded out with sewage while out fishing. Spoke to my wife from the landing and she filled me in on a major rain storm flooding parts of the city. Our backyard was under water, as well as the driveways either side of our house. I told her ""Don't worry, I'm coming home with the boat."" lol  In the fall we cleaned the shed (haden't fished since the flood due to required repairs in the basement and then that's when i realized all of our fishing gear had disappeared. Two tackle boxes, six fishing rods and reels. Some still in the package.  This was my Christmas list;  Ugly Stick fishing rods, Mithchel open face reels, tackle box, yellow & black 3/8 &1/2 oz.  jigs, swivels, yellow & black twisters, William warblers, Normark or Rappala filet knives, Rappala lures, muskol, mepps spinners and pliers and sun blocker.

430630,Twocoda,2010-02-07 17:26:00,4130,if i had to do it all over again i would buy better condoms ....so the person responsible for me having to replace things on a regular basis ....wouldnt exsist..  seriously though ....im not sure i would change much of my purchases....still using most of my stuff for many years ....but i do rotate it to newer versions of a respected set ups

430697,Fang,2010-02-07 19:34:00,1330,Pretty happy with my current set up. Took me 20+ years to get there though. I would have to say I have learned not to purchase entry level stuff on the following. You'll only upgrade soon after and be left with that lower end stuff collecting dust - waste of money for me  High powered Fish Finder and GPS Trolling Motor Downrigging rods and reels  Things I would purchased and never found a value in Aqua View camera Storm Wildeye plastics Planer board mast Swim Whiz muskie plugs

430771,pooch,2010-02-07 21:43:00,139,"My first purchase would be a bait caster and some braided fishing line. I guess I'd need some lures too, so my next purchase would be a spinnerbait, crankbait, swimbait and a jig. That should get me into a bass or two come summer.  The best purchase I ever made was a boat, motor and trailer combo. Nothing like getting out on the water..."
