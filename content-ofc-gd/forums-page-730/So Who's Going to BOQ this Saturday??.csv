429329,Leecher,2010-02-04 03:01:00,7832,"Well this will be our first time out on the BOQ and I just can't wait to give it a try..... I've seen so many reports of big walleyes that it's all I dream about  I'm not quite sure which area we are going yet, I think it's Napanee area..... well any how, if you are going to be in the neighborhood, come and say hi     would be great to meet some of you guys  I'll know more details about our adventure tomorrow. Tight lines Leechman"
429347,Roy,2010-02-04 03:32:00,13728,"Good luck to you guys, Jacques! You should be getting an email or PM in the next few minutes for an offer if you haven't already received it."
429351,irishfield,2010-02-04 03:35:00,26272,Have fun boys!!!  Roy...
429352,Leecher,2010-02-04 03:37:00,7832, Thanks Roy!!!  I'm still waiting   Thanks Wayne!!!
429396,Greencoachdog,2010-02-04 10:58:00,8163,"Sounds like a blast Jacques!!!  I looked up the weather forecast for that area for the weekend and it looks like a balmy -8 on Sat. and -6 on Sun., y'all be runnin' around in short pants and t-shirts in that kinda weather eh?  There are ""green trout"" in that area, so you need to remind that Whitespinnerbait guy that they're off limits or he'll be stenching up the ice with those disgusting things!  Y'all be keerful and most of all Have Fun!!!"
429404,Spiel,2010-02-04 12:21:00,9065,"Well I know I won't be there but I hope you have a great day!  And remember only 2 lines per angler, that's right only 2......"
429416,Stoty,2010-02-04 13:14:00,2910,"I'll be there!   I'd offer some info, but that would be classified as ""SPAM"" on this board.....unless of course your PM me for details."
429425,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-04 13:30:00,2690,I wouldn't sweat it Jamie...   You going to be out on Valentine's day with the team as well?
429427,Seaweed,2010-02-04 13:36:00,135,I will be there  I am attending JeffC's Ice Fishing Seminar  Hey I love new techniques and that guy can haul em up like no one I have ever seen... so I will be paying close attention  It might break my love - hate relationship that I have with that body of water.  I have no idea where we will be fishing... so... good luck everyone and watch that ice especially around current and if you don't know the bay and you don't see any anglers there... then you probably would be wise to avoid that patch of real estate.  Stick with the crowd.  Tight lines
429431,Leecher,2010-02-04 14:00:00,7832," Thanks Glen!!!  Yeah should be a blast for sure    I just can't wait..... weather wise, not too cold, just perfect   not sure about the short pants and t-shirts, we have a 3 hour+ drive to get there so I'll make sure I bring extra clothing just in case As for the Green Trout, no worries.... I'll remind Paul of it for sure Just to get in the walleye mood, I booked tomorrow off cause no school for my daughter so will be going over to my favorite lake for some quality time out on the hard stuff and may be get into some smaller eyes     She has her own jigging rod now... bought her one last night   Thanks Chris!!!!  Yeah I know.... 2 rods    but on the bright side.... means less work maintaining the holes   Thanks for the offer Stoty!!!  This is all new to me but will have more details by Friday as to which area we are targetting....  If you happen to see a guy with a black suit and fur hat, come by and say hi"
429432,Leecher,2010-02-04 14:04:00,7832, Thanks Seaweed!!!  Good advice and good luck to you too
429443,Stoty,2010-02-04 14:46:00,2910, I sure am my friend! We better get some good fish...that way it's worth being in the doghouse!! LOL   No problem dude. I'm happy to help.
429452,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-04 15:21:00,2690,
429454,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-02-04 15:28:00,1362,Hey Jacques....you mean to tell me that you dug into your pockets and finally bought an Ontario fishing license   ....good on you!!!!....have fun   ....there's no stopping ya now
429458,Leecher,2010-02-04 15:34:00,7832, Thanks Steve!!!  Couldn't pass the opportunity to get a chance of catching a monster eye     Should be a blast
430550,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-02-07 15:02:00,1362,  Hey Jacques......how did you and the amigos do???
430557,Greencoachdog,2010-02-07 15:12:00,8163, .. either they're writing reports... or were visited by Pepe LePew.
430574,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-02-07 15:36:00,1362," Glen, I think Pepe paid them a visit"
430599,Leecher,2010-02-07 16:14:00,7832," It was a blast all right.... hurricane winds     On the east side, there was 5"" to 6"" of black ice.... Got setup in about 25' fow, marked fish on the electronics but could not get any fish to comit  Well except for Kevin..... he got a hit a couple of hours into it and that was about all we could endure in those hurricane winds unfortunately     Ah well theirs always next time"
430604,Greencoachdog,2010-02-07 16:22:00,8163,Dang! I hate that for y'all Jacques!  Maybe next time go with a hut operator to have some place out of the wind?
430605,Leecher,2010-02-07 16:23:00,7832," Nothing to report Glen.... Pepe LePew had to upper hand It was still a nice 4 hour drive out and 4 back     We made it all the way to Belleville only to see the big pressure crack the was very dominantly holding in the middle of the bay    Ice over there not safe at all  But just to give you some type of report..... here's what our day went about... Got up at 2:30am, prepped the last minute gear and food for this adventure and left at 3:00am, picked up Kevin and the way we go...  Arrived in Napanee at sun up and proceeded onto the bay.... wind started to pickup and 2 hours into fishing... gusting pretty hard.... we saw one guy running after his portable hut and that was all we could endure, so we got off and stopped for a coffee and breakfast.  After being able to get warmer, decided to head over to Belleville and see if we could somehow get into another session but the ice was not safe at all and the pressure crack was huge, so we decide to head back.  On our way back, we could see open water everywhere that usually at this time of year would frozen over.  So needless to say, we made our trip back to Gatineau and arrived at 4:30pm    At around 8:30pm I crashed into bed only to wake up this morning at around 9:00am  It was nice to see another part of the globe that I never set foot on We all had fun except for that darn wind Ah well..... that's part of the game Jacques"
430611,Greencoachdog,2010-02-07 16:36:00,8163,"  Monsieur Jacques, I' de beau jour ; le ll vous attende la fois prochaine !"
430613,Leecher,2010-02-07 16:39:00,7832, Yeah next time G
