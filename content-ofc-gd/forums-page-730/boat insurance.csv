430529,Radnine,2010-02-07 14:16:00,1538,"Mine is through my house insurance. I can't imagine why your broker would not be up on it. Hell, the person I was dealing with was in Bangalore and he dealt with it fine. Jim"

430642,archer379,2010-02-07 18:11:00,277,i have mine as a rider on my house insurance as well
430646,Roy,2010-02-07 18:15:00,13728,"I was once told, several years ago that I could have a boat and motor as a rider on my property insurance only if the motor was 25HP or less. Don't know it that was true or if it still holds but I have always had mine as a stand alone policy. And I DO read the fine print."
430787,irishfield,2010-02-07 22:11:00,26272,"Most home policies cover boats up to 18 HP.. give or take.. read your fine print.. but only to the tune of $1500 usually.. and liability which is the most important part.  You can upgrade, at cost, for any horsepower you want. I cover the 25HP and steel boat at the camp that way for about $65 a year for theft ($6500 value) on the 25 honda and 2 million liability for boat use.  If you have a nice new boat though.. I'd highly suggest a marine policy, with full replacement value. I use ""First Mate"" -  Royal Sun Alliance Yacht Works for my Lund."
430855,mistaredone,2010-02-08 00:58:00,913,"I insured my boat through RBC under my home insurence.  $10 a month for a boat worth $10 000.  Had my 90hp motor stolen this year and recived a $5500 pay out that covered a new used 90hp motor, controls and install.  10 out of 10 for RBC.  Liability also included in coverage."
