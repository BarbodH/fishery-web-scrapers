430860,JohnF,2010-02-08 01:15:00,3494,Great light show. Great songs Great instrumentals. Too bad those old farts haven't been told they don't sound so good any more. Daltrey can't quite get to all the notes any more and Townshend looked silly trying to be a cool rocker - dude's just too old for that look.  Oh well. Nothing's as inexorable as time.  JF
430865,Rizzo,2010-02-08 01:28:00,4754,"those guys were old when I was in grade school 30 years ago. I guess this is what they mean by ""its better to burn out than fade away"""
430871,JohnF,2010-02-08 01:42:00,3494,It's still kinda fun to see the old farts strut their stuff. Neil Young's voice is pretty creaky these days too. But the music still holds up pretty well. My satellite radio hardly ever gets past the 70's station.  JF
430873,redneck666,2010-02-08 01:48:00,563,i guess everyone must be watchin the super bowl eh? with saints 13-colts 17 and saints on 3rd down.
430874,Radnine,2010-02-08 01:48:00,1538,"I thought that Daltry pulled it off better than Townsend. After all these years I thought Pete would have known not to wear a jacket that would cover the strings and cause you to miss 30% of your notes. When you think about it, it was vintage Who. Jim"
430879,TJQ,2010-02-08 02:02:00,7806,I thought they were dead....
430882,Radnine,2010-02-08 02:10:00,1538, You're half right (two out of the four are). Jim
430931,tb4me,2010-02-08 04:34:00,3295,I thought they did a great job..also liked the Brittish Invasion to the American game.. The halftime show was better than the game..
430939,hammercarp,2010-02-08 05:07:00,964,I thought it was great and so did everone else in the room.
430942,waterwolf,2010-02-08 05:36:00,556,"had to expain who they were{are} and what they represent to the music encyclopedia to my daughter but yeah they put on a great show for iconic stature individuals ,, respected members of music front-runner club. come on ,, a little older ,, a little heavier , aren't we all??  how much did they make ?? just curious.,,,,,aren't you??"
430955,bigjacob,2010-02-08 11:40:00,3,I think they did a good job since its been more then 40 years as a band.
430960,Cast-Away,2010-02-08 12:54:00,790,It's too bad for Roger that Pete's mike was turned on because Roger sounded raspy and Pete just sucked!  What's with the Who of just Two? Time to pack it in boys.
430966,canadadude,2010-02-08 13:29:00,769,"I agree, time to hang it up boys the tempo was way off the old boys can't hold a note anymore without Entwhistle's driving bass beats it's just not the same. I saw the band 8 times in the late 70's, I think 3 of the shows were there final shows hahaha. We all didn't want them to stop but now it's time boys to give up the rock & roll and retire and spend the 100's of millions of $$$$$$$$$ and hang out on the beach."
430967,JohnF,2010-02-08 13:33:00,3494, Somebody already said it. Better to fade away than to rust. I'm happy to hear their music on recordings and remember them (and me) as we were. Seeing them creaking away on stage is too much like looking in a mirror.  JF
430968,Governator,2010-02-08 13:35:00,879,This is why it was The Who.. see the trend?  2004 Wardrobe Malfunction 2005 Paul McCartney 2006 The Rolling Stones 2007 Prince 2008 Tom Petty 2009 Bruce Springsteen 2010 The Who  Old guys don't flash people.
430970,JohnF,2010-02-08 13:41:00,3494, Whoa!!! That just conjured up an image of a wrinkly nekkid Townshend shakin' and groovin' on his 6 string.  EEEUUUWWW!!!  That could end the half time show forever.  JF
430972,Headhunter,2010-02-08 13:44:00,5703,"I've been a huge Who fan for years and frankly I think they should have hung them up 20 years ago... Roger hasn't been able to hit any of the high notes since 1976, Who are you. Pete should focus on his solo work. Funny, but this morning I had quite a few people saying that they didn't know that The Who wrote the theme song to CSI! Uhmm... song was recorded in 1970 folks! As a huge legacy Who fan, I would like to see them wrap up their careers on a somewhat ""high"" note, turn in their union jack blazers and retire on their laurels! The band died when Moon died in 78! HH"
430974,John,2010-02-08 13:53:00,2956, I was a big fan and grew up with their music and that of the rest from over 'ome at the time. Unfortunately Moon and Entwistle will be rolling over in their graves after that one..
430978,capt bruce,2010-02-08 14:29:00,820,"Water wolf askd how much did they get paid ??? Nothing the nfl has never paid anyone for the half time show not, U2 not the Stones , no one  http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/su...rtainment_x.htm"
430979,Hellfish,2010-02-08 14:42:00,308," I second that, Zac Starkey ( ringos son) played a amazing set, townshend was rocking it out for sure. I must say though, when I saw the Guess Who play at Canal Days in Port colborne I was more than impressed with cummings and Bachman actually they blew away with their performance."
431001,bigbuck,2010-02-08 15:50:00,2449,"Hey, they still rocked!! For a couple of 60 somethings, Roger and Pete rocked the house. It's cool to see these guys go at it. Maybe they can't hit the high notes and don't look so cool any longer but I grew up listening to them and it was great to see them live one more time."
