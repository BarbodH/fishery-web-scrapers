430500,Twocoda,2010-02-07 13:09:00,4130,even though the Colts are 5-1 favorites.....im going to predict   Saints 30.... Colts 24
430513,bucktail,2010-02-07 13:49:00,1857,"Have to go Colts 31 -21 Colts have a very underestimated defence, which I see as the only main dif between these two teams."
430534,bassdreamer,2010-02-07 14:28:00,128,I would love to see the underdog saints win their first super bowl.  Saints 28 Colts 17
430536,TerryC,2010-02-07 14:32:00,196,"Colts in a romp, most likely going to be over by the time the WHO start playin.  Take this for what it's worth, I'm a Detroit Lions fan.  Clarence."
430546,Terry,2010-02-07 14:53:00,14456,what is a superbowl? an eating contest?
430548,bigugli,2010-02-07 14:57:00,6138,A lot of beer will be drunk today
430549,Cudz,2010-02-07 15:01:00,2652,Would love to see the Saints win but the Colts are probably too well rounded.
430559,splashhopper,2010-02-07 15:13:00,2931,superbore..... but my wife likes the half-time COMMERCIALS
430571,yakpiker,2010-02-07 15:31:00,160,I'm a  Cowboys fan.  Dallas beat New Orleans.  The Colts will win and cover.
430572,troutologist,2010-02-07 15:35:00,951,"I'll have to take the colts primarily because of Manning. Though their pass protection had better be on point. I suspect you'll see a bit less spread and they will keep a back or 2 in the backfield to pick up the blitz packages tossed at them by Greg Williams.   Saints running game (with Bush) plays into the speed of the front 7 for Indy, downhill runners give the colts more problems.   Colts 34 Saints 27   I also believe I will be challenging Drifter as the most northern contingent from OFC during the game....either Igloolik or Iqaluit depending on the weather."
430594,NAC,2010-02-07 16:06:00,369,I predict the highest SB score to date. don't expect much defence in this one  Ed Reed put the Colts here and the refs put the Saints in.
430596,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-02-07 16:10:00,1362,I love underdogs.....C' MON SAINTS!!@!!!
430658,redneck666,2010-02-07 18:31:00,563,COOOOOOOOOOOOOOLTS!  i don't predict scores cause i usually mess that up......... lol.
430660,Billy Bob,2010-02-07 18:41:00,5865,The Saints are lucky to have beaten the Viking in overtime and only because of 5 Minnesota turnovers. Take those turnovers away and the Saints would have been blown out at home.....  Colts 38 Vikings 21
430665,canuckjack,2010-02-07 18:54:00,121,"Colts take this one real easy, Payton is just too good.  It'll take him a quarter to figure out the defense and then he'll pick em apart.  I'm actually looking forward to this superbowl, I think it'll be a good high scoring game  Time to go score some Keith's red"
430807,fish_fishburn,2010-02-07 23:03:00,1311,"For the people of New Orleans, I want the Saints to win their first Super Bowl, them people been through alot in the last few years."
430808,JohnF,2010-02-07 23:07:00,3494, I think it's just a fat man's intestine - misspelled.  JF
430809,JohnF,2010-02-07 23:09:00,3494, So will a lot of fans.  JF
430985,canuckjack,2010-02-08 15:15:00,121,"  Mmmm, nothing like the taste of your own words in the morning...Good thing I didn't put any money on that."
431021,blaque,2010-02-08 16:39:00,2419, Bassdreamer wins........off by a field goal
431040,Twocoda,2010-02-08 17:20:00,4130,yes bass dreamer is the closest....must have some crystal balls or something ....all in all.... it wasnt a bad game for a superbowl....
431162,bassdreamer,2010-02-08 21:20:00,128,"What do i win !!!! :clapping:lol. That was one lucky guess,I'm a diehard steelers fan,and i like to see different teams win the superbowl when the steelers ain't in it !"
431208,Twocoda,2010-02-08 23:50:00,4130, you win the right to try and guess the outcome for some Olympic competitions  ...polish up those crystal balls
431223,bassdreamer,2010-02-09 00:25:00,128,Sorry to say this :i don't think canada will win the hockey gold ! Hope i'm wrong !
