We arrived just before check in (1:00pm) on Thursday; we were on the ice and fishing before 1:30, fast and efficient.  Huts were very clean and well equipped, the staff drilled holes as many and wherever we wanted. The staff checked in on us a few times during the day to see if there was anything we needed, again great service and very friendly.  Fishing was fairly good Thursday and Friday but shut down on Saturday and did not return. The Perch were hitting very softly and you had to be patient with them.  That being said the outfitter canâ€™t control the fish bite but can control how he treats his guests and for that I give Scott and Christine a big thumbs up!!!!   I will be going again next year.  I would defiantly recommend Glen Echo."
