430707,Dabluz,2010-02-07 19:45:00,701,For Musky baits....I would most certainly buy them from someone who makes them himself.  There is one guy here in Quebec that makes about the best you can find anywhere.  Extremely durable and tough with great action and top quality hardware.  They cost about 40 dollars each.  Shipping is free for orders over 100 dollars.
