430073,archie_james_c,2010-02-06 02:18:00,618,Love both ...although I can't seem to shoot any big game  January-September= Fishing October/November= Hunting December= Back to fishing  Whats everyone shoot? My main toy is a Sako Model 85 Stainless Laminate in .338 Federal.
430116,T Fisher,2010-02-06 03:34:00,139,"I fish and Hunt and sometime at the same time Moose hunting from a canoe while draging a spoon catching Northern pike and large Specks, also hunt Deer, Turkey, Grouse & Jack Rabbits. No more Ducks or Geese, you can blame steel shot.  Love the outdoors and the outdoors will love you back."
430124,irishfield,2010-02-06 03:50:00,26272,You mean moving place to place in the canoe and then hunting moose correct?
430126,archie_james_c,2010-02-06 03:52:00,618,"  You can shoot big game from a canoe, so long as it doesn't have a motor."
430129,irishfield,2010-02-06 04:01:00,26272,"New to me Archie. When I did my stuff any vehicle/vessel was out of bounds unless hunting water fowl. Regs still state: Snowmobiles, vehicles or boats may not be used for chasing, pursuing, harassing, capturing, killing, injuring or destroying any wildlife.. and the definition of a boat according to the OMNR hunting regs is any power boat... be it motor powered or muscular powered. I have an open mind.. if you can point me to the reg stating shooting from a canoe is okay..."

430134,irishfield,2010-02-06 04:11:00,26272,"Got that part and I stand corrected, thanks... ""muscular powered"" applies to vehicles.. not boats.. so I guess no shooting the 303 from your bicycle! lol"
430136,archie_james_c,2010-02-06 04:12:00,618,  Gotta love Ontarios rediculously pointless laws....some Liberal yuppy from Toronto probably wrote that one up...
430358,Sinker,2010-02-06 23:05:00,8692,"There used to be a law against fishing AND hunting at the same time. I'm not sure it still exists, but is another example of a stupid law written by some Liberal dumb ass!  S."
430359,Sinker,2010-02-06 23:06:00,8692," I don't know when the last time you used steel shot was, but it kills them just fine for me and my buds. Get them a little closer and shoot thier face off  S."
430373,Billy Bob,2010-02-06 23:38:00,5865," HUGE difference in steel shot compared to lead shot.......that's why the rest of the hunting world (rabbit, squirrel, pheasant, turkey, partridge, woodcock, etc....) is still using LEAD and not steel shot.....  BTW....I fish and hunt deer, ducks pheasants, woodcock, rabbits squirrel, partridge, etc....also pilferage, plunder, grow things and collect edibles......"
430463,Carp,2010-02-07 03:57:00,1488,I do both. Don't keep many fish and never shot anything that wasn't going to be eaten.

430488,Curtis,2010-02-07 11:21:00,83,"Jim i think this is probably true with 75% of the hunters on the board. We grew up doing it and its like a family tradition that our fathers, fathers showed them. It comes natural too me i have been shooting guns since i was 9 years old and hunting since i was 12.  As for hunting accidents SOME ppl shouldn't even be allowed to own a firearm thats my view on any hunting accident...  I love both sports just waiting on a buddy right now to go chase yotes.."

430842,waterwolf,2010-02-08 00:10:00,556, i take a camera everywhere i go hunting\fishing\driving. unfortunately i got a skunking this year but have many photos when not actually hunting so still had a great year.even a 130 class at the GTA airport. another 10 pointer goes even bigger but just a bit out of 4x camera range. that's C&R . hunting aint always what you kill but more like what you take home without taking anything.
429607,Gravyboat,2010-02-05 00:56:00,44,"Just cuious how many hunters are on the board.  I fish, but not as much as I use to.  I find myself hunting much more and sometimes prefer to shoot clays on summer days rather than fish.  Hunting is not an easy activity to get started in, so I'll assume there's going to be more fisherman (oh... that and because this is a fishing forum  )"

429642,Rizzo,2010-02-05 01:54:00,4754,"just fishing. Don't think i could bring myself to shoot an animal (I release 99% of my fish as well). Having said that, doesn't bother me if someone else hunts as long as its put to good use (same applies for keeping fish)."

429659,Grimace,2010-02-05 02:14:00,2020,Just a fisherman here.  Always fished as a kid.  I have respect for hunters as I do fisherman.  I just never got into it.  To all those fisherman that do not respect hunters---   Remember one thing--- The people who care about the resource take care of the resource.   You do not see p3ta involved in stocking programs or the caribou herds or ducks or elk.  Cheers
429660,GeorgeJ,2010-02-05 02:20:00,207,I have been fishing for a couple of years and just got my hunting license and PAL. Getting set up to do a lot of both soon as I retire in 2012!

429696,hammercarp,2010-02-05 03:07:00,964,Fish and hunt. I used to hunt a lot more. Now it's just deer. There is enough of them around here.
429708,MJL,2010-02-05 03:24:00,2427," Ditto…There’s tranquilizer dart hunting   .  I heard there was an experimental type of hunting in Africa for elephants using paint balls…Pretty sure it didn’t work out though – Saw it on the Discovery Channel a while ago.  I only fish at the moment (almost entirely catch and release).  I don’t hunt mainly because: - I don’t have a freezer big enough to store all the meat - My family in general doesn’t like eating game – The majority of my friends don’t either - From what I’ve been told, you gotta drive pretty far away from cities to hunt (I go fishing often but usually not for very long) - I do prefer eating different types of fish and seafood more than any other type of meat - My friends tell me you gotta wake up insanely early in the morning (when it’s freezing cold) to set up decoys  I’m pretty interested in the various aspects of hunting – Like animal tracking, deer/turkey/duck calling, stalking, marksmanship, camo, trail cameras, etc.  I’m sure a lot of what hunters do can be used in fishing situations.  In the future, I would love to tag along on a hunt with somebody to see what it’s like.  Some animals I do find quite tasty.  I don’t have any reservations on people killing an animal so long as it’s going to be used for food and not wasted.  The closest thing to hunting that I do at the moment is walk around the local forests with my super zoom camera and take pics (sometimes I hide behind shrubs and trees)…Would love to get more into nature photography and learn more about animal behaviour (aside from what I see on the Discovery Channel or the internet)."
429715,pike slayer,2010-02-05 03:33:00,1177,i mostly fish bit i am slowly getting into hunting. right now i do grouse and small game. i'd like to start getting to migratory birds and possible deer and bear hunting. not enough friends do it.
429732,xeon,2010-02-05 05:35:00,350,"If its a swimmer, its my dinner. If its a hopper, I pop er'. Brown its down. Black its whacked. Flies it dies.  Am I missing anything?  I will not keep a trophy or trophy potential fish. That means no muskie, no pike over 28'', no walleye over 20'', no St. Marys fish of any kind (gross). I will keep enough for dinner, or invite some friends over so they can experience a little ""taste"" of the outdoors if they are starting to act a bit too urban. I will keep all whitefish. They've made it personal. I would, and try to harvest trophy mammal species like black bear or deer. Next year may be moose.  Do I care if you hunt of fish? Not at all, do what makes you happy. But, if you have a problem with hunting or fishing don't bother questioning my ethics on it or I'll tear yours apart."

Once hunting season starts, I don't fish, I want to spend all my extra time in the bush. I am not a trophy hunter but I have a few great bucks on the wall."

I did however enjoy hunting immensely (strictly small game) and may take it up again in my retirement. I was fortunate enough at the time that I did hunt to supply myself with a lifetimes worth of fur and feathers for another hobby, fly tying.  I also have numerous friends who hunt and they frequently gift me meals of wild game so I still get to enjoy plenty of good eats."
