If you want send me a PM about what your situation is and I'll see if she has up to date insight into it."

430811,cheaptackle,2010-02-07 23:13:00,849,"Denis, I have about 10 years under my belt in property management.  Been before both the old Tribunal and current Board as a Landlord many, many times, both alone and with very high priced representation.  As a result I've had a lot of exposure to both the Landord's and Tenant's perspectives, positions and approaches.  The newer Landlord and Tenant Act has many changes in it that can be advantaged in a number of actions which the previous act had no recourse for. If you want to get into your specifics feel free to pm me on it.  There are also many case histories on the Board's website that may be similar to yours that will be very enlightening. Michael"
