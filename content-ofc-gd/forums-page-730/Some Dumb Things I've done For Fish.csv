430301,bushart,2010-02-06 20:11:00,2628,"Cliffs' thread got a few old timers (Me excepted) into sayinging how we have put time and effort into learning about fish and techniques...  Well coming with that--I'm sure we've all done some lets say, less than Einsteinian things over the years...  Here's a couple of mine (course there's more)  1/ Being a kid growing up in the North End of Hamilton----just dying to fish anywhere---1st ice out used to be in Spencer's Sewer --I mean creek in Dundas I used to ride my single speed bike out there like in March or early April and fish for suckers---being a kid--no arthritis---so friggin cold I could hardly move my fingers to thread a worm---that's kinda harmless  2/ This one's better---when I was 18 I took a job with ""The Bay"" and they posted me in Northern Saskatchewan---so I landed there a few days before my winter gear (with my boots)---this was like May and the ice was still on but snow mostly gone----so I heard you could catch Grayling (Something I had'nt done) in the Fond Du Lac river about 5 miles outta town----so genius decides to walk the slushy ice in running shoes to go fishin with a 20 dollar outfit I just bought at The bay---I did make it---caught zip---seen some though---decided to take a camp road back to town----got somewhat lost---made it out though---yep lots of thought went into that fishin trip where Dudley Greenhorn tours wolf country tryin to catch a fish.  Next....  Bushart"

At the time an almost complete lack of respect for lightning, coupled with my youthful invincibility.  18ft cederstrip.  ... and a very old 5 horse evinrude.  Part way back to shore I began to think I would be better off swimming for it instead."

430305,vance,2010-02-06 20:43:00,719,"Lake Openongo May 24 - 12 ft boat 6hp motor-near freezing-dense fog-and a fair bit of wind and we figure its safe to head up the lake to go fishing.Well dad and I got lost in the fog the waves nearly swamped the boat we never even got to fish because we were too busy bailing.When we got back to the dock one of the local guides asked us if we were nuts to go out in this weather.We told him we nearly made it to the west arm,all he said was IDIOTS and walked away and after a pause my dad said you know he is RIGHT,  and  what ever you do DON""T tell your mother!!!!

430310,bushart,2010-02-06 20:58:00,2628,You know they usually start out like a good idea.  I imagine May 24 Opeongo Lake was li'l on the chilly side
430311,grt1,2010-02-06 20:58:00,638,"When I was a kid (a long time ago) , growing up in Brantford, I talked my dad into taking me fishing ""up north"" because I had just seen a guy up the street bring home a northern that he had caught ""up north"" and it was edible. (at that time the Grand River was SOOOO polluted the fish were just good enough for fertilizer).  Anyhow, he piles me into the car and away we go, Up North, all the way to Belwood Lake, yup, the one by Fergus. To my dad that was as far north as he wanted to go, anyway he rented a rowboat and off we go , but, the boat leaked so bad that I spent all my time bailing, he spent his rowing and just when we were 1/2 way to where we wanted to go, a storm appears on the horizon so he turned around and we headed home without even wetting a line.  not much of a fishing experience but a great memory of him and his effort to keep a kid happy.   A couple years ago I started out to go fishing but the fog on our lake was thick out on the main body of the lake and our bay was just semi-foggy, you know the kind you can see through, . So off I go , I can see the island down the bay and know my way past it, but when I hit where the island was supposed to be the heavy fog had rolled in and was really dense. I knew if I followed the shore line of the island I would be in the main body of the lake in no time. I followed the shore line for an hour, when the fog lifted, I was back in front of my own dock.  Now I take the gps."
430338,bigugli,2010-02-06 22:05:00,6138,"A few years back, the late fall walleye bite was hot up on the French. So we decide to run up to the trading post for the weekend. Got up Friday morning, weather was in the low 40's F and the bite was great. 20+ walleye and pike over 4 hours is darn good. Overnight the bottom dropped out of the thermometer. We woke up to 10F  . Heavy frost and everything iced up and heavy squall bands coming in from Huron. On top of that, we did not bring winter gear. Me and the other Einstein     decide we'll tough it out anyway in the tin boat. My fingers ached for days. All for a glorious 1 pike tween the 2 of us"
430341,tdotfisherman,2010-02-06 22:18:00,317,Dumbest thing I've done due to my obsession for fishing was probably going out on a crappy boat alone. I knew the boat was having problems starting and I knew that it was getting late and that cell phones didn't work up there.. but I went out anyway..  The boat finally started after about 15 minutes of pulling..  I don't take chances like that anymore..

Anyway on the morning of day 2 the gun goes off and away we go. Got about a klick away and the motor stopped. No problem just change the gas tanks and were off. Well the other tank was empty too and we had to be towed in to get gas at the marina. Man felt like a idiot that morning."
430367,trevy727,2010-02-06 23:26:00,351,my dad used to take me out in front of the bruce nuclear power plant in lake huron. We'd enter the chinook chantry classic every year and fish out of a 14' springbok with a 9.9hp merc. in between the 3-6' rollers we'd see nothing but the top of the next one. we used to go so far out we couldn't see shore. somehow my dad always knew where shore was. we caught fish. my mom came 3rd place in the trout catagory 1 year with a 15.43lbs rainbow.

430385,smitter,2010-02-07 00:25:00,106,"1. Canoeing into a backcountry pickerel lake on opener one year, weather was great on the first two lakes and the portage, but when we got on the main lake the wind was nuts. We were going to camp on an island, and there was no safe place to beach on the route. The wind was so bad, we were just crawling forward, big waves for a little canoe. When we got to the Island I got out of the canoe and hugged and kissed my wife like it was the end of time. We didn't leave the island all weekend, luckily we could catch walleye right off the island.  2. Hiking with camping gear in 10km in the middle of winter in LSPP -25 nights, brutal. Normally not all that bad, but we got SKUNKED all weekend.  3. put my truck in a ditch, again in the middle of winter on our way to a speck lake. I though we'd be out there all night. Thankfully a kindly snowmobiler with a cabin near by came by and offered to get his truck to pull us out."

430482,Syn,2010-02-07 06:21:00,519,"Three dumb things I did about 15 and 30 years ago. All done in Europe.  1) While on holiday fishing from a rocky ledge in the Mediterranean caught a cool looking bright red fish. I lipped like a bass and it presented its high back spine, so I thought it would be a handy place to grab the fish from. I'm holding the fish from the spine making it look like its floating horizontally. My uncle comes around the corner and is yelling it me to let it go which I did. Found out it was a scorpion fish and the spines are highly poisonous.  2) My cousin and I got bored fishing from a concrete pier in 40 ft of water. So we went back to the house and sharpened the ends of two broomsticks. We went back to the pier dived in and there were 5 foot in length white/silver fish about 30 feet away. We thought we were going to throw spears at the fish while underwater. For some reason physics in real life does not work like it does in cartoons.   3) Thought I would be a good idea to pull myself down to the bottom of an anchor rope and explore the bottom rocks. So I pull myself down to about 25 feet, my ears are killing me from the pressure and its dark and suddenly I'm less than an arms length away from a moray eel with a head that's bigger than mine and I'm frozen with fear watching it, its looking back at me and its taking large breaths. Thank god it was not in a bitey mood. I surfaced quickly and had a pounding headache for the rest of the day. Wonder if it was the bends?  I just realized I've done more dumb things for fish than dumb things to impress women."
430542,bigugli,2010-02-07 14:45:00,6138," As it should be. Fishing should be more important than chasing women, unless you're chasing one that actually loves to fish."
430545,bushart,2010-02-07 14:52:00,2628,K note to self......  Offer to take twocoda bass or walleye fishin if he wants but maybe decline the great lakes adventure series if he offers
