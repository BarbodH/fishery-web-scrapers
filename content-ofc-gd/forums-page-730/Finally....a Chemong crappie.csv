We had to add some perch and a few big bluegill for a meal.  My buddy also lost a massive perch at the hole, one of the biggest I've ever seen on the Kawarthas.  We've put a lot of time on Chemong and a few days on Buckhorn as well. Nice to finally get a crappie, now the question is can we repeat next weekend. All fish were caught in about 7' of water."
