493527,bulltron,2010-08-11 13:54:00,88, acer liquid is a good phone.... and there pumping out the new 2.2(froyo) firmware for it soon ... which is better than most android manufacturers.

494938,Stoty,2010-08-16 16:30:00,2910,I'm still trying to locate one!!! grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
495283,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-17 03:34:00,947,Heard they are landing at rogers on Tuesday and Wed around 12-3  if you call and all you get is a busy signal time after time.  most likely they have someone

495300,GoneFishin,2010-08-17 05:20:00,349,How is every one liking the new iphone 4? I have the 3gs and have been having lots of problems with it lately and I'm starting to think about upgrading. There pretty much one thing I would like to know. Does it actually work as a phone!? Any freeze ups/blank screens?
495301,blizzcat,2010-08-17 06:14:00,92,I was at Rogers today with my friend who wants to buy one. The guy there said they should get them in stock in 2 weeks.
491353,bulltron,2010-08-04 20:07:00,88," Thats great you dont have issues, the yellow discolouratoin was a relatively rare issue, not having prox.sensor issues is solid, I know alot of ppl that have that one ...  As for the ports being covered up, its a rumour in the mobile circuit (xda, engadget, etc ..) ... The editor and chief of engadget made a post about it earlier in the week...  The white cases will have to be remade anyways, so why not just cover the port hole i guess is the argument there ... it woudl save apple alot of money in the long run ... Agreed, just a rumour, before being flamed for posting it.. lol.... The speculation is, thats why the white iPhone 4 has been delayed for so long, to make sure the 2nd wave doesn't have that external port.  again, speculation, and rumour, but from the most reliable mobile sources on the internet... people who havn't steered me wrong before with leaks, and knowledge of other phone manufacturers and there news before it hits the public ears/eyes."
491358,Steel28,2010-08-04 20:14:00,160," good to know, thanks!"
491460,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-05 02:06:00,947,Trevor Perkins will you be my Valentine
491550,fish_fishburn,2010-08-05 12:08:00,1311,"Whats an Android phone? I am in the market for a new phone for work and don't know what to buy. Mostly used for calls, text and e-mails, photos as well.  Any suggestions, I know nothing about this."
491560,Fisherpete,2010-08-05 13:01:00,1814,Had to share this video on the Iphone 4 vs. HTC evo... a buddy forwarded it to me yesterday. Has some harsh language - don't view in front of the little ones! The links to the video and rebuttal video are in the first paragraph in green text.  http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/01/best-buy-iphone-4-evo-4g/
491561,Sketty55,2010-08-05 13:09:00,52,"I was in Sherway mall  yesterday in Etobicoke and there was a line up of about 10 people outside the apple store. The rep told me that they got more phones in and these people were all accounted for and would receive phones, but that was it for the day. He told me to call into the store and then get down there asap if i wanted to get one."
491578,Governator,2010-08-05 13:51:00,879,"Been with Blackberry since 2005 with the old 7200 model (First coloured blackberry).  Email is my life and I think I'm just too use to a real qwerty keyboard to ever switch to iphone.  The new blackberry torch (slider phone) looks slick although not 4G.  Comes out Aug. 12th, probably will upgrade from my bold to that."
491604,bulltron,2010-08-05 15:03:00,88," The Android phones are just open source touch screen phones, but they have the best hardware for any phones .. amoled screens, 1ghz processors are the norm with matching RAM, 3.5g is standard on all the phones since the release in canada in november 09...  soon to be coming out with 1.5ghz dual core processors ... pretty insane power ...  if your just using a phone for calls/pictures/sms/mms .. any phone will do ... but the UI of android is really nice and clean, second only to meego IMO .. but meego is in china, lol... they are cheaper, more usable, and easier/cheaper to fix (provided something goes wrong) than iPhones, but essencialy the same thing,  If your into games, applications on your phone, 90% of the android market is free to dl and use .. with the most expensive app on the market that i've seen(thats usable for the average user) is about $2.99 ..."
491789,Stoty,2010-08-06 00:42:00,2910, Ummm.... iPhone's use a qwerty keyboard
491805,Governator,2010-08-06 01:03:00,879,  Sorry I meant a real keyboard and not just a touch screen kb.  I've used an iphone 3 for testing emails from my buddies and I just couldn't get use to it.  The blackberry torch gives you both the touch screen option or the slider keyboard.  Probably a good way to ease people like me in to the touch screen era.
492090,Stoty,2010-08-06 22:07:00,2910,"Ahhh, ok I gotcha. Yes, the touch screen keyboard takes a little getting used to, but once you master it.. you can fly!"
492091,bulltron,2010-08-06 22:11:00,88," I'm not sure if Swype available for the iPhone yet ... but  if it is, far superior to any other way to input to your phone.    check it out ....  I can txt at about 65 wpm with swype(on screen keyboard-QWERTY)"
492093,ctranter,2010-08-06 22:14:00,543,"Apple is, and always will be, the Nazi's of the computer industry.  I build every PC myself, take good care of my HD, and have never had a problem.  If you like being told how to you use your technology, or like having serious hardware restrictions, then join the line of pop.culture drones outside of the apple store."
492103,bulltron,2010-08-06 22:43:00,88," lol, a comparison of apple and national socialism ... almost perfectly suited .... lol...  you forgot the monetary value of those ""amazing computers""  now apple uses intel for there processors, so there no different, and the only excuse apple people had to justify there purchase was ""i work with multimedia"" .. well now the creative suite is geared towards nvidia graphics, which apple does not put in there machines, they use ATI ... I guess they shouldnt' have pissed off Adobe so many times, especially with pulling flash support on their phones days before release .. lol..."
492249,Stoty,2010-08-07 15:14:00,2910,"Believe it or not, I am a hardcore PC user that also builds my own systems. I don't like Mac's, but I love the iPhone. It's obvious that a few of you have a strong dislike towards it. To each their own, I guess!  I simply can't wait to get my hands on an iPhone 4, that's for sure!"
492293,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-07 18:55:00,947,  yea i can't wait either.  Back on Topic anyone have any luck with availability yet.  please post i will do the same if i find any info
492705,Stoty,2010-08-09 00:19:00,2910,"Had a store call my buddy (who already got one) about having one in stock today, as I was sitting beside him. He told them he already had one, and hung up. He then told me that the store has one in stock, so I literally called 2 mins later, and it was already gone!!!"
492759,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-09 02:36:00,947,oh man how does that Happen lol
493261,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-10 16:13:00,947,heard a shipment is happening tomorrow for rogers
493271,Stoty,2010-08-10 17:09:00,2910,"Any locations in particular, or just in general?"
493286,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-10 18:45:00,947,Barrie is where i called
493295,bulltron,2010-08-10 19:35:00,88,"rogers store in whitby downtown has 3 iphones currently, my friend just text messaged me now ..  im assuming by the time anyone in the area reads this, and gets down there, it will be too late. lol.  but, heads up for you iphone fanboys anyways"
493304,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-10 19:55:00,947,yea one of my co-workers was on a call list she got the call went down and got her phone.  i called to see if i can come right now and pick one up told them one of our employees was on the call list.  She told me the call list is not a first come first serve basis.  If we call you we put your name on the phone till you get there.  what the hell not very fair IMO
493314,bulltron,2010-08-10 20:13:00,88," agreed, thats pretty lame .... but, thats rogers!"
493326,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-10 21:04:00,947,ok finally got one they had 13 come in today at the georgian mall in barrie when i left they had 2 rogers on young st in barrie got some in as well.  i think bryne drive will get some tomorrow
490965,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-03 20:44:00,947,Does anyone work at Rogers that can help me with getting an iphone 4.  I live in the Barrie area and they just tell me to keep calling them.  It's getting frustrating  .  Any help with shipment dates would be great Pm me if you might get in trouble lol
490968,kickingfrog,2010-08-03 20:46:00,8333,Why? It's not heavy enough to be a good anchor?
490970,Steel28,2010-08-03 20:50:00,160," good luck Henry, got mine last Friday. I hear that Apple stores get daily shipments."
490974,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-03 20:55:00,947,Really ehh Thanks for the update
490975,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-03 20:56:00,947, Naw that's what my 3Gs is now
490986,batoathome,2010-08-03 21:13:00,47,I know a telus dealer that has 3 iphone4 16G instock in concord area If any one is looking? PM me
491102,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-04 01:41:00,947,It's Telus I'm with Rogers
491157,bulltron,2010-08-04 03:02:00,88,"iphone 4 ? are you new? lol. ... such a terrible phone... lacking hardware, lacking firmware, just terrible...  android ftw  but, if you do get an iphone, with iOS/4 .... there is a browser enabled jailbreak for it, should make your life alot nicer ... and by jailbreak, i mean MAJOR security flaw ... go apple!"
491158,bulltron,2010-08-04 03:04:00,88,"  if you buy it from apple store, its sold ""unlocked"", which isn't really unlocked, but, temp it is ... you can use it with any carrier that works on quad band gsm .. but as soon as you use it with any carrier, its locked to that carrier, so for your case ... but the phone, activate with telus, then its locked to telus .... telus and rogers use same quad band. so it will work edge, 2g, 3g, hsdpa(3.5G) so your golden on telus."
491288,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-04 16:54:00,947, Thanks for the info Trevor i would love the new Iphone 4 but paying full pop for it isn't in my budget.  I can wait a bit for it and pay the discounted price for the 3 year contract since i will still have a cell phone for 3 years.  They just to expensive buying brand new
491289,John,2010-08-04 16:55:00,2956,"I guess I'm just too old to understand, or care what the hype is all about...."
491312,cityfisher,2010-08-04 18:40:00,959,  hahah terrible... never heard anyone call it that
491313,bulltron,2010-08-04 18:43:00,88," Thats just it with the iPhone, Hype .. nothing more, its an under-delivered, over priced, garbage phone ... for 300$ less you can get a FAR superior, open source phone that will do much more, and cost tonnes less ....  as far as smart phones go, iPhone is worse than Blackberry .. I've had them all, and Android phones are where the smart buy is..."
491315,highdrifter,2010-08-04 18:44:00,2534,Careful with the G3...  Your provider might charge you up the    for texting out of the service area..
491317,bulltron,2010-08-04 18:49:00,88,"   +1 ....  theres options to turn off data when roaming, something of course your service provider wont tell you, lol, but, the option is there .. such a smart option to turn on... thats the first thing on all my phones after unboxing and activation."
491319,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-04 18:50:00,947, 
491320,Stoty,2010-08-04 18:50:00,2910,"""Good luck finding one"" I was told by a Rogers CSA this morning. I've called everywhere looking for one, and no-one has them at all!  Some stores are making ""waiting lists"" that will take your name and number and will call you when they get a shipment in. It's a first come, first serve basis."
491322,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-04 18:55:00,947,Yea Stoty thanks for the update i'll let you know if i find any more info about it.  i did talk to rogers as well cause they are doing a special promo on 6gig data plans for $30.  they told me first week of sept
491325,bulltron,2010-08-04 18:57:00,88," If your looking to purchase an iPhone 4, be it on contract, or outright .... your best bet is to wait till the next manufactured wave gets released...  you won thave to buy a bumper in which case, the white ones are the next wave to be released, and the antenna ports have been covered up for these, so you wnot have teh rediculous reception loss holding it in your left hand ..  if you can be patient, waiting is the best course of action.  thats not even counting the yellowed screens, or the boot loop issues with this wave of phones, steve jobbs pushed them out way to early"
491333,Stoty,2010-08-04 19:08:00,2910,"Apple is providing iPhone 4 cases that apparently correct the signal issues, for free."
491334,bulltron,2010-08-04 19:21:00,88," no fix for bootloader loops and yellowed screens though ..  and for ppl who im assuming will be fishing with there phones, if moisture gets between the phone and the case, it will still ground out causing reception loss."
491341,Stoty,2010-08-04 19:28:00,2910,"I've fished with my iPhone for 2 years now. No issues at all with any aspect of the phone.  IMO iPhone is the best phone available that everyone is trying to duplicate. Everyone likes different things, and are entitled to their own opinions.  If you like crackberry's, then cool. No doubt they are good phones as well just not my thing."
491344,bulltron,2010-08-04 19:42:00,88," I just meant iPhone 4 and fishing, with the external antenna point might cause issues with moisture being around them, the older iPhones didn't have that issue, 2G, 3G, even the iPod Touch generations ... also, Android was around before iPhone.. just to clarify that point. It wasn't called Android, it was the company that sold the technology to Google, then branded Android, Apple has never been known for being innovative .... The iPhone has its purpose, same as the macbook, etc ... niche market products, that people will gladly purchase for 200$ over the next phone with better hardware(processor, gpu, etc ..).  One thing I will give iPhone, is once its jailbroken, can do alot of cool things ... As a mobile developer, I do enjoy the open sourceness of other OS/manufacturers, and the iPhone again, once jailbroken, can have just as nice of a GUI as any other phone on the market, for sure with almost the same functionality ...  but, if your into just making phone calls, sending the occassional mms/sms, and taking pictures on your phone ... then, it really doens't matter what phone you get. lol."
491345,fishinguypat,2010-08-04 19:47:00,547,...well the iphone is the best phone in the world as of right now.
491349,Steel28,2010-08-04 19:57:00,160," how do you know about antenna ports being covered in the next wave? any proof?  I also have no antenna issues, yellow tintage or proximity sensor issues and really enjoying this chunk of metal"
