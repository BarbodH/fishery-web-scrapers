I checked CT and they only had geese and duck callers. Is there such a thing,she thinks it would be cool to talk to the loons when we are camping.  Any suggestion greatly appreciated. thanks"
495099,Roy,2010-08-16 20:29:00,13728,Lots of loon recordings on the net. Download some and play them while out camping. You should get some answering.
495116,Terry,2010-08-16 20:53:00,14456,loons are not picky they answer anything even close to their call  I just say whoooooooooooooo while moving my tongue around my lips..(man that sounds wrong) and they answer every time..just match the tone and rhythm of their call
