So far what I have in mind a reasonably long ice fishing rod spooled with 3 colors of #27 lead core line, with a 4 pound cannon ball on the end. Any ideas or suggestion before I go and do this?"

I'd run the lead core on a trolling outfit instead. The only decent home made riggers I ever saw were made by a very experienced 20+ years tool and die maker/ pattern maker with a milling machine, drill press, metal lathe and metal band saw in a home work shop. Even at that he used Big John pullies and scrounged his employer for quality materials. just sayin"
