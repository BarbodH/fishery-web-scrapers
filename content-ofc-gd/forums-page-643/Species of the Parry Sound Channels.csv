Pretty much south of Parry Island.  Now, I used to just fish for bass because that's all I seemed to catch on a hook and worm with the occasional bonus pike. But I see people out there with down riggers so I can assume there's salmon out deep in the channel?  Does anyone know what species are predominant in these areas? Or is it just mostly Pike and Bass? I assume Pike are plentiful as the season is open year round.  I'm looking to maybe get into a walleye but I'm not sure if my efforts would be wasted. I mean I haven't really figured out where the monster pike are... which is what I really want to get into. But if there are other species and my bass/pike tactics aren't working I'd love to hunt another species.  Thanks for the input in advance!"
