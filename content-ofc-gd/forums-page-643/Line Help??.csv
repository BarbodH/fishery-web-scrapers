495410,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-17 15:42:00,0,Well I can tell you not to buy Triline sensation or XL Smooth Casting cuz of weakness or braided lines cause they freeze up in the winter.

495415,dave524,2010-08-17 15:47:00,4508,"Starting out, I would go with something economical as you are probably going to start side casting and it gets twisted pretty fast and you'll need to respool. Limper lines are better for side casting, maybe Trilene XL or Ande would fit the bill here. Eventually I recommend highly you get into a Wallis or pull cast style, a stiffer line like Trilene XT or Maxima type lines are my prefernce at this stage of the game. These aren't the only lines you can use but indicative of the type of line you are looking for. Hope this helps."
