495286,splashhopper,2010-08-17 03:45:00,2931,"His name was Hutch.  He was my closest friend and spiritual mentor since 1994.  Hutch's faith in God, Service to others and infectious optimism for life was a sight to see and be a part of.  He was a solid ""friend of Bill W"" for the past 28 years.  This man walked with me through ups and downs and never once complained about his own failing health in the last six months.  His shoes may never be filled with the likes of this giant ever again.  Hutch helped hundreds of men turn their lives around from the depths of the bottle.  I know God has a seat reserved right next to him and I am confident that the two of Them will watch over me as they see fit. I am sure they will even have a laugh or two at my own expense. I miss him already.  Thank you OFC for being a special place for me tonight.  Sincerely  Ron Hunter"
495290,Joey,2010-08-17 03:53:00,9122,"Very sad to hear that Ron, my heart goes out to you.  Think of only the good times and his spirit will live on in you.  Take care.  Joey"

495306,Big Cliff,2010-08-17 09:30:00,6899,"From the song THREE WOODEN CROSSES By - RANDY TRAVIS  ""It's not what you take when you leave this world behind you. It's what you leave behind you when you go.""  It sounds like Hutch has left a lot of wonderful memories, and helped a lot of people! May he rest in peace."

495319,splashhopper,2010-08-17 11:28:00,2931," I like that line Cliff:  Hutch left behind a long long list of people he helped crawl out of the bottom of a bottle.  As a direct result of his un-dieing support and love, so many have turned their lives around and are helping others do the same.  THAT IS one helluva legacy to this man."

495350,aplumma,2010-08-17 13:15:00,6896,Great people who affect our lives at sometime will move on. While it makes you sad he no longer is here in body the lessons and guidance will live on thru you and if you pass them on he becomes immortal. Take the time to grieve as needed but also take the time to rejoice for he has been freed from the pains of failing health and can now look down and watch the lives of the many he has guided.   Art
