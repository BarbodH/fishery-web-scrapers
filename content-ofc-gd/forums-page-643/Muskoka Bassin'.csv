Today I went to the same spot again, and the bass were still on fire.  I hit the same spots that produced on the top-water last week, but our luck was slim...only a few a marginal largies.  So, we headed to the opposite side of an island that I had did well on last time, and that is where the hot action began.        Then, we land this 19.5"" monster:      Release:    Then, a couple nice smallies (flash messed up the photos):  First one was 16.5"":        We then headed in for lunch.  After lunch the lake was pretty windy, so we decided to fish a couple protected coves.  At the first spot the action continued, but didn't really cough of fish heavier than 1 lb.    Double header action:    So, we motored over to another cove, and got into some better fish.  17"" largie:      16.5"" largie:      Action shot:    Last good fish:     By the end of the day, we caught somewhere between 35-40 fish.  Today they were almost all largies, except for 2-3 smallies.  In terms of lures, 90% of the fish were taken on x-raps, while a few were caught on worms, and a couple on a spinnerbait.  Not bad for fishing from 9:00-3:00!  That's all...hope you enjoyed."
