Been fishing up around Longpoint for many years, mostly some bass,perch... but now I don't have much time or chance to go there anymore,  So now just looking for some fishing idea's in and around London, Ontario.  Where around Springbank, Fanshawe or Delaware? Near the Dam? I heard the bridge on Clarke Rd is a decent spot? What about Delaware or Komoka?  I live near the Pond Mills area, not sure what the Westminster Ponds is like (near the cemetary), but been told that around Parkwood Hospital there's a few good spots, anyone fish there?  Can you park a car nearby?  Thanks in advance!!!"
494398,raiderfan,2010-08-14 16:13:00,9,"also, if fishing around the dam at the Thames or Fanshawe, what do most ppl here use for lures / bait that they find works good?"
494415,Lunatic,2010-08-14 17:56:00,536,"theres a dude on youtube goes by the ghetto fishing show. he lives and only fishes in london,he tells you the exact locations (probably to the dismay of some cry babies) and what he is using."
494454,scugpg,2010-08-14 20:20:00,1373, The show is actually pretty entertaining and has some good tips on where to go around here.  Buy lots of jigs if you're fishing the river
494456,Lunatic,2010-08-14 20:27:00,536,"we'll take those any day,put this guy back so we can catch him later...what you can doooo,yeahhh"
494459,raiderfan,2010-08-14 20:37:00,9,thanks for the replies...   I'll probably check out some of those spots this weekend.... and the youtube vids
495438,raiderfan,2010-08-17 16:19:00,9,"well I watched his video's, great stuff!!!  So on the weekend I went to one of his ""spots"", was near Labatts on the Thames, my first cast I pulled in a small mouth bass!!! I was like, damn ghettofisherman is the man! LOL  I was using a 2"" brown rubber grubber!!!! Caught a couple more after that as well, then I tried to go after something bigger and went for carp or catfish, caught two catfish, not huge or anything, but was pretty fun still!!!   I wanna try Delaware next... what's a good spot out there?  Someone told me around Carriage Rd ???  How about near Sharon Creek Conservation Area? Anyone fish near there?    thanks for your help!"
