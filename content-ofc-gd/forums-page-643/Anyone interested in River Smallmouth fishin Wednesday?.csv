495382,Musky or Specks,2010-08-17 14:45:00,2710,Looking to see if anyone interested in going out tomorrow for some river smallmouth. Not the Grand but some of my honey spots. Let me know here or in a PM
495461,markiemark70,2010-08-17 17:08:00,158,"Man I would love to go out with you sometime. I am not as flexible as some as I have 2 small kids, but usually the wife and I work out a day I can fish at the start of the week. I am going today (tuesday) if you are available. If not I would love to try to plan a mid week fishing run with you another week, I usually start around 4 or 5 but can be flexible on the time since I am self employed.  Cheers"
