494965,bubbles,2010-08-16 17:35:00,591,Looking to find out what the water levels are like in the Chapleau area right now. Headed up in a few weeks and some lakes are only accessible when the water is a little higher.  Any help would be appreciated. Thanks

However, I do remember Solopaddler's epic report of two weeks ago and judging by the pics, the water seemed quite a lot lower than normals for this time of the year."

The lake I was on is spring fed , and is close to 2 ft lower. Some of the dammed lakes and rivers are nothing but trickles of water ,and huge islands I've never seen before. I also clipped my prop ,in a place I've been 100 times before. Take care up that way!"
