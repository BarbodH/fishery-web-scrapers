495534,Gordon Bombay,2010-08-17 19:24:00,6,So I was having a discussion the today and the issue arose as to whether a vehicle with Ontario plates needs 2 of them if they are out of province.  It seems to me that there would be no issue with having one plate.  Does anybody know about this?

Cities and states here short of cash, so they now issue tickets for one plate. If they give you two with matching numbers when you buy them? seems that would indicate you need both?"
495571,Gordon Bombay,2010-08-17 21:51:00,6,No real reason for knowing.  We were just driving through the States and it came up.  I kind of want to do it just for the sake of doing it.  Although...   This idea has me really thinking.

495577,Bill Shearer,2010-08-17 22:07:00,456,"One train of thought.... While travelling south in spring and fall, from PA, to FL, you will see many cops sitting on the overpasses, looking at the oncoming traffic. Any vehicle with a front plate, is out-of-state, and fair game to enhance the treasury. Instant cash, for a cash-strapped economy. But they probably wouldn't prey on Canadians.... would they?"
