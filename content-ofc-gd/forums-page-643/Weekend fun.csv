We caught a pair of decent (19 1/2 and 18 inch) walters Saturday night in the short time we were out...        Both were released, one caught trolling the other in the shallow weeds.  Sunday was the derby, had a great time!  The weather stayed good until the end at 3 o'clock.  Met a great group of guys and gals.  Couldn't buy a walleye that day.  Juli was the bass fishing queen.  Didn't catch any really large fish, but, some decent ones and lots of numbers. The bbq afterwards was amazing, venison burgers to die for!!!!  Couple pics of Juli's bass      The storm we drove through on the way home was pretty intense, driving rain, some trees were down.  Didn't take any pics.  Heading for Restoule on Saturday."
