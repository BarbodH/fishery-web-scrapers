She's on just before the 30 second mark!   you might also recognize the good lookin' dude in the black t-shirt....  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxUlf_PnTpc&feature=related  Cheers, Ryan"
494959,danbouck,2010-08-16 17:24:00,4380,Nice!
494962,mbosh1980,2010-08-16 17:30:00,349,"She's a natural...imagine the gills she could catch with that combo. oops i mean ""system"".  Hope she gets one as payment for her cameo. Is my computer dying again or is the audio a touch off in that vid?"
495028,alexcba,2010-08-16 19:08:00,634,"hahaha. first she's reppin the facts of fishing jersey, now she's gettin spots on the show! i want her autograph before she gets her own show!"
495031,Joey,2010-08-16 19:10:00,9122,"That's great Ryan, funny too"
495035,JohnF,2010-08-16 19:17:00,3494,"She could be the next Maryko Izumi, except she'll know how to fish.  JF"
495038,SudburyAngler,2010-08-16 19:19:00,154,"Geeee, I wonder why Mariko has her own show"
495051,alexcba,2010-08-16 19:39:00,634, 
495053,scugpg,2010-08-16 19:47:00,1373,Very cool!  I want that fishing rod/reel combo as well!
495056,MCTFisher9120,2010-08-16 19:47:00,3761,"Congrads kiddo, she could become a actress ya know"
495065,fish-miester,2010-08-16 19:59:00,864,haha very nice
495066,kickingfrog,2010-08-16 20:02:00,8333,"Nuffin' like Milli Vanilli.  I don't do as much ultralite (is that word aloud?) as I used to, maybe I'll get back to it."
495363,JohnF,2010-08-17 14:02:00,3494," It sure ain't for her fishing skill. It's more about the belly button I suspect. Not that that's a bad thing, mind you.  JF"
495368,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-17 14:14:00,932,  Congrats to Averie!  I'm sure she loves it.

495440,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-17 16:23:00,2690,"Awesome Ryan, she's a ""cutie""!!! Now answer, the question everyone really wants to know...does Dave practise that crazy laugh, or does it come naturally..."
495467,The Urban Fisherman,2010-08-17 17:21:00,2050,Thanks for the replies guys! Haha Averie loves it!  And yeah Frankie that's Dave's real laugh!
495544,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-17 19:55:00,932," Heh, I know you're his cameraman, so you obviously know, but you're not the first person I've heard this from.  I know a few guys who fished the Shimano invitational tournament in NY with him this year and they couldn't get over that that's his real laugh."
