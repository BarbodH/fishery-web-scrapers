495489,Harrison,2010-08-17 18:02:00,2202,"Not so much the truth, just what mother nature told me over the years.  We have to have the cooler nights with some rain combined with a nice off shore breeze, then hold on. Couple more weeks yet for the prime time piers.  But then again, there are always the premature horn ball bucks trying to get the early jump on things."
495491,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-17 18:08:00,0, I'm afraid to go in the river again cause one might try to spawn with my kayak...   
495495,pike n' whities,2010-08-17 18:15:00,131,I heard they're goin in GANARASKA.....
495652,GBW,2010-08-18 01:36:00,8460,"I had seen a fish today.  Headhunter showed me a pic of a past catch.  Does it count?  However, it did have one of these in it's yap on a hook.  "
495666,Paulus,2010-08-18 02:11:00,522," Funny  is this referring to another post?  Yes, they are staging now. Take your glow spoons and hit any likely pier after work. This is the best time, because they are mostly fresh  I will wait a week or two yet, then catch a cold *cough* *cough*   p.-"
495670,splashhopper,2010-08-18 02:18:00,2931, So that others won;t have to ! 
495682,Gerritt,2010-08-18 02:36:00,6129,"yawn..another year, more flossers.. Joe I told you investing in marshmallows would pay off!  G!"
495729,pike n' whities,2010-08-18 05:28:00,131,  All I have to say on this one is....... maybe.
495733,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-18 06:20:00,0,  I finally got what this means.....he he Me running over all those peoples lines with 5 bucks around me would be a sight worth seeing..... Ill even mount an egg dispenser at the bottom of my kayak to help with the stocking....

495813,Guest JPCT,2010-08-18 15:55:00,0,They are already in the rivers/creeks.  A bunch of small creeks are already loaded.  2/48 yesterday lol..
494154,fishinguypat,2010-08-13 17:12:00,547,any idea of how long we lookin at until the salmon start staging around piers?
494155,SudburyAngler,2010-08-13 17:15:00,154,Never caught a salmon in my life anywhere near sudbury where I could catch them
494156,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-13 17:16:00,0,Some were being caught right behind the charter boats in Port credit last week.....So any time.... I guess you'd just have to go and look and try for yourself.
494166,craigdritchie,2010-08-13 18:10:00,1586,"About a week ago, in some places"
494167,BillM,2010-08-13 18:13:00,17367,Get out to the piers and let us know!
494170,fishinguypat,2010-08-13 18:25:00,547, why would i drive an hour plus away from my house to see if there are salmon staging?
494171,Roy,2010-08-13 18:27:00,13728, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
494172,Harrison,2010-08-13 18:29:00,2202, are you serious?

494177,Chromeblood,2010-08-13 18:35:00,14,saw one dead the other day  
494178,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-13 18:37:00,0,  you expect everyone else to do all the leg work for you ......  Kinda goes along the lines of your money for nothing and your chicks for free.....
494180,Guest JPCT,2010-08-13 18:47:00,0,Lol. I was wondering when a thread would pop up about this  We were gettin them off a certain pier on July 30th  I've also read they are getting them off the rocks in port credit.  That's where I will be tonight
494186,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-13 19:24:00,0,"Hi, i'm glad I joined this board. I somehow got hacked on ontario fishing forums, but the admin won't believe me lol.   Question: I'm a bit too lazy so can someone be a sweetheart and tell how far out the salmon have been jumping from shore? I promise to post a report. Thanks!"
494191,fishinguypat,2010-08-13 19:37:00,547," i meant, if anyone had already gone, so i could get a general idea since water temps were higher this year..."
494192,mbosh1980,2010-08-13 19:46:00,349,It sounds like it is time to start chucking spoons to me!
494196,dobee,2010-08-13 19:49:00,301,get out now and start chucking spoons and let us know! i caught my first two years ago on aug 8th....
494209,Roy,2010-08-13 20:28:00,13728," Must have been a recent ""hack"" because you were on OFF yesterday afternoon. Also there's a question of your other identity on this board. PM me and we'll try to straighten it out."
494211,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-08-13 20:32:00,0,i sometimes go fishing when i KNOW there isn't much chance of getting fish. some people fish for the wrong damn reasons.  lol!
494237,lucabrasi,2010-08-13 23:06:00,114,"Didn't you start this last year too? Just wondering.  If you're the same person I'm thinking of, you could pretty much have all your questions answered over at the fishontario forum where you posted regularly about the Salmon in Bronte Harbour. Why ask the same questions here? Once again...just wondering.  No offense, but it seems like you're trolling."
494242,Paully,2010-08-13 23:29:00,712,Wait for a cool north wind.. then try your luck.
494243,toca,2010-08-13 23:29:00,274,They Might Be In The Piers Already. Im going to check it out this weekend see what i catch.
495474,fishinguypat,2010-08-17 17:32:00,547," ok i just asked how long are we talking here in terms of water temperature,and what people have seen, to get an idea of if it were to be a later run this year?"
495478,BITEME,2010-08-17 17:39:00,1968,Okay you want the truthful answer if you start seeing Monharc Butterflies over the lake in regular numbers its time. take this information anyway you want but that is what I use. First good rain after that hit the rivers some of the lake fish are starting to morph already.  Honest Peter
495481,fishinguypat,2010-08-17 17:46:00,547, THANK YOU!
495482,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-17 17:47:00,0,"Alright man, if you want a TRUTHFUL, TRUTHFUL answer than stay tuned for RB's next Port Credit Report coming either this Friday or weekend."
