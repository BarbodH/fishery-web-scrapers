495535,TC1OZ,2010-08-17 19:33:00,987,"What bait were you using again? lol just kidding!  Awesome report, I wonder if I can get my hands on some before I head up to the cottage...."
495557,Jer,2010-08-17 21:04:00,1426,"I just used my last few while at Crotch Lake last week. Today, I found myself at Brock Rd & the 401, looked up and saw the Tightlines store. I now have three more packages of SLAMMERS. They really are a nice bait. Nice store as well."
494535,diggyj,2010-08-15 01:43:00,548,"Headed up to the cottage on Wed afternoon and I was looking to get some fishing in as the weather was looking much better then the previous weekend. I started out on Wed night with SLAMMERS off the dock and the action was quite slow but then it turned on all of a sudden for a while and I was able to land a total of 3 walleyes. Here are a couple of the better ones. Once again all under the slot except one of them.      After the bite went cold, I decided to put on a black Jitterbug as the water was quite calm. I had a few attempted splashes and bites but was only able to hookup with one of them.    Thursday morning before heading out in the boat I was able to catch one off the dock on a SLAMMER. It was chewed up on the head from either an attempted attack or disease of some sort.      I then headed out in the boat with one of the kids and the bite was pretty good. Was landing small ones of all kinds, all on SLAMMERS. I was able to catch and land one decent one and actually lost 2 much bigger HAWGS boatside due to inept netting and landind skills.    That was it for Thursday. Didn't try at night as I was knackered.  Friday morning I once again took numerous casts off the dock and I was able to land a few small ones.      Headed out in the boat for a few hours and once again the SLAMMER bite was hot. Managed 3 keepers, 2 of which were decent but the disappointing part was that I once again lost a bigger fish right at the net yet again. I may just start landing theses by the lip instead of trying to hold a rod and a net. Yes I suck.        After some down time, I took some more casts from the dock and I landed another decent Smallie on yet another SLAMMER.    One thing I can say with confidence again is that SLAMMERS work like no other bait. Yes the were slow last week when the cold front went through but with some patience, these baits not only put fish in the boat but big or bigger then average fish.  All of these fish, except the ones caught from the dock were caught in my two favourite stretchs in 10-12 FOW just outside of a well defined weedline. SLAMMER colour of choice was either 210 or 213.  Dirk"
494538,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-15 01:57:00,0,SPAM!!!!lol Next year i will get in touch with MR.Kulik and give those slammers a try.
494540,cpguy29,2010-08-15 02:13:00,148,Nice! I actually picked up some Slammers after reading your previous post. I even caught my first fish on it too....a smallie.
494543,Grimace,2010-08-15 02:35:00,2020,So what did they give you?   The t-shirt and a few free baits?  Where are the bigger than average fish?  Is that the only bait you used all week end?  Are you using a different camera now?  Your pictures do not boast the type of camera that they use to.
494546,Aaron`,2010-08-15 02:52:00,25,"I can tell you my uncle Mark puts alot of work into his baits, and they do work, nice fish dude."
494548,diggyj,2010-08-15 02:55:00,548, It's retarded comments like yours which reminded my why I no longer put up as many posts as in the past.
494570,Chromeblood,2010-08-15 04:51:00,14,"Man after a day like that you must have some raw thumbs, great report!"
494571,Cudz,2010-08-15 05:05:00,2652,"Just got back from the cottage up in Parry Sound area and you are correct.  70% of my fish came on slammers.  20% on tubes and 10% on wakebaits and another 10% on worm harness.  Do the calculations.  When I fish I give 110% all the time. lol.  I do love the slammers.  My new favourite bait these days.  Mark has developed an awesome bait and if you fish for smallies, you need to get some.  No question about it.  Now I need to figure out how to stop the little fish biting off the bait's tail."
494586,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-15 11:13:00,0, Good! Your gonna give me one to try!!!!  In October(when my cast comes off) I'm going to be drop shotting them in deep water!  I've heard nothing but good things about slammers!  Diggy?You let a few negative remarks stop you from contributing to the board?  Looking forward to your next SLAMMER report!lol
494606,cpguy29,2010-08-15 13:15:00,148, Sure thing man. I tried them up on G___ lake. We caught a bunch of smallies in that spot we fished before. Mostly on tubes. Also caught a nice largie on a jig and pig. Flipped it to a fresh laydown and bam!
494617,Spiel,2010-08-15 13:59:00,9065," Would it have been okay if he was using Rapalas while wearing a Rapala shirt, just curious.  The way it's been going for me these days Diggyj, I'd be happy catching anyone of those fish."
494703,EC1,2010-08-15 19:56:00,930,"Looks like some awesome fishing dirk!  I too lost a big smallie yesterday, but I think I lost it because I didn't have a net! Lol. They always seem to know to run the second you try to put your hand at their mouth."
494709,SudburyAngler,2010-08-15 20:07:00,154,nice pigs
494762,Stoty,2010-08-16 00:22:00,2910,"Great job Dirks!  Don't worry about the negative comments. You obviously caught more/bigger fish than they did over the weekend.  Keep up the good work, and see you for hockey pool's this year!"
494774,Toronto_Angler,2010-08-16 00:56:00,698,Great Fish diggy! Really enjoy your reports from the cottage. Havent been able to get out this year which sucks but I live through these kinds of reports lol.

I fish smallies alot on the Ottawa and would love to get my hands on some Slammers to give em a try. What is the name of the company, and where can I purchase some of these? I look for them in every tackle shop I go to in my neck of the woods and have never seen them."

494882,Nipfisher,2010-08-16 13:11:00,2449,"diggyj,  Have you tried / marketed SLAMMERS up North at all? There is some excellent SMB and LMB in the North Bay area and Nipissing is an excellent smallie lake? Can I get my hands on a few so I can try them here? I could show them to a few local bait shops with contact info."
495292,Cudz,2010-08-17 04:00:00,2652, diggyj doesn't work for the company as far as I know.  Mark Kulik designed and makes these baits.  Mark is a really solid bass tourney guy and guide.  Simcoe Bait and Tackle is now called Rack and Reel.  It is still in the same location in Barrie and I just bought 2 packs of slammers there yesterday.
