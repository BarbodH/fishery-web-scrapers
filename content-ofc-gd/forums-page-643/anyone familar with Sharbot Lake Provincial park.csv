I would prefer one on the water and have a list of ones available. If someone could reccommend one it would be much appreciated. thanks  site available- 3,7,61,111,115,117,119,136,142,153,175 all are waterfront sites,hoping for on to beach the boat and allow the pup to swim,thanks."
495142,Lostchild,2010-08-16 21:29:00,153,"Most of those sites you posted are not truly on the lake. #175 is, if memory serves me correctly it isn't too bad.  When you are online viewing the descriptions of the sites #175 is the only one that states ""Lakefront"" the other state ""Waterfront"" or view of the lake.  None of the sites are on Sharbot lake they all surround/on Black lake, a very small lake, more suited for canoes and such.(bass and panfish)  I maybe wrong but I believe the dog beach is down at the boat launch to Sharbot lake (short drive within the park.  Sharbot lake although at times can be a tough fish it does have some quality bass in it.  Hope this helps somewhat, have a great time!"
