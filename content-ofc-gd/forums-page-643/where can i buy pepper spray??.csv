495498,pikeguy,2010-08-17 18:21:00,195," if your dad shouts at the bear with a 410 he had better be able to run, It may sting the bear but will piss him off and may charge at him.There are .410 slugs that he can get and be safer with that but the bear has to be pretty close for that size gun . But if your Dad,s bear is not near the dump there are guy's around there that will take him down there are some avid bear hunters in that area,and i'm one of them i will be going there this weekend to help out on tracking a bear.  Is your dad's bear about 300 lbs with a brown streak on his head thats the one im gonna go find"
495052,bow slayer,2010-08-16 19:46:00,1074,Looking to pick up some pepper spray in the London area.  My dad has been seeing and having some close encounters with bears the last few weeks up in Lavigne area and I would like to pick him up some to carry with him. thanks
495057,alexcba,2010-08-16 19:48:00,634,http://www.basspro.c...D=TOP_SEARCH_GO  could always order some. 
495058,TC1OZ,2010-08-16 19:49:00,987,Just PM Lunatic and tell him the bears scratched your daddy's car!
495059,alexcba,2010-08-16 19:50:00,634, ROFL!!
495060,bow slayer,2010-08-16 19:55:00,1074,"wow CT here in town has it in stock for 45 bucks,never thought CT would have stocked it."
495062,SudburyAngler,2010-08-16 19:57:00,154,Just PM Lunatic and tell him the bears scratched your daddy's car! LOL
495071,TC1OZ,2010-08-16 20:07:00,987, It was too easy!  Instead of just taking the topic south! Might I suggest you get bear mace versus just regular mace! I hope that helps!
495072,Brettiop,2010-08-16 20:08:00,279,Forest city surplus had bear mace at one point...check there!
495073,SudburyAngler,2010-08-16 20:09:00,154,I might also reccomend googling bear encounter tips
495076,jedimaster,2010-08-16 20:12:00,3472,yah go for some bear mace rather than pepper spray. Its way more potent.   err no comment on the scratched car....
495100,kickingfrog,2010-08-16 20:31:00,8333," Funny. I had to do a little serchin' to get the referance... and now I am doing everthing I can, not to comment further."
495147,blizzcat,2010-08-16 21:36:00,92,you won't be able to get pepper spray but they have bear spray at bass pro shop  good luck!
495173,bigfish1965,2010-08-16 22:09:00,3382,"Definitely get the bear version. The dog sized won't have any affect other than to make you taste a bit more spicy. Bear repellant also has a foaming agent which sticks to the bears yap. Best repellant is a 30.06 I have the dog sized canister for the coyotes, but I don't even think they are big enough for them."
495184,Steve_R,2010-08-16 22:36:00,81,LMAO
495205,danbouck,2010-08-16 23:13:00,4380,I have some Bear Spray that you could take if you can pick it up in Cambridge.
495206,Black_Blade,2010-08-16 23:18:00,258,"LOL...was just looking at the bear spray can offered at Canadian Tire.  Good for 8 seconds spray time at approximately 25'.  Interestingly, there don't seem to be any product reviews...that may be a bad thing...nobody that had to use it made it back to write a review  Agree that best deterrent is a 30.06, but have to get PAL license, etc etc."
495240,smally21,2010-08-17 00:48:00,993,ive seen bear repellent sold in just about every gun shop ive been in.  google a product called 'thundercloud' - a fire extinguisher sized jet of maximum strength capsicum out of a standard aeresol can.  no idea where to get it unfortunately.  you could also consider hanging out with some guys that dont run as fast as you can
495279,bigugli,2010-08-17 03:16:00,6138,Funny I should just see this thread now. I just finished spending 2 hours getting bathed in fresh capsin. Darned skin is on fire. I'm sure I could boil up a quart or two of some liquid pain. The only known cure being copious amounts of beer.
495280,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-17 03:24:00,0,I was just thinking it would be funny if someone sneaked up on a snagger from behind and quickly sprayed a few.
495328,Fish4Eyes,2010-08-17 12:08:00,1022,"Go to/call a local gun shop. The shops around my area carry them. Not cheap though, expect to pay $35+."
495342,bow slayer,2010-08-17 12:37:00,1074,"  thanks for the offer Dan,but last night he picked some up in Sudbury ,a couple cans one to carry and another to keep in the atv,plus he said he will start taking his 410 with him  back in the bush."
495345,NAW,2010-08-17 12:45:00,4022, Will a 410 even break the skin on a bear?
495354,Fish4Eyes,2010-08-17 13:22:00,1022,"Did the bears actually approach him, or was he just too close for comfort?"
495463,markiemark70,2010-08-17 17:12:00,158," Cheaper than the alternative, I would suggest."
495464,BITEME,2010-08-17 17:17:00,1968,LEADCORE in the .44 version
