495153,ctranter,2010-08-16 21:42:00,543,  PSHH go big or go home!  Hand grenades partially filet the fish and send them high enough in the air that you can catch the eggs on the way down.

495228,Marko,2010-08-17 00:38:00,854,"I can not believe some of you people are arguing over few fish that will start decomposing in a week or two. So there are couple of fish there whats the big deal. Anybody in GTA knows that Ganny gets probably the best run out of all tribs around here so ITS NO SECRET THAT THERE ARE SALMON THERE. Most of us choose not to go there because its sad to see what goes on there when the sun goes down or just in general. I just dont get people, its not like they taste great anyway."
495230,Bunker,2010-08-17 00:39:00,29,I love salmon season......  time to rig up that 50 lb power pro.....

495091,Guest JPCT,2010-08-16 20:23:00,0, Fishing the piers is a tad different than beating salmon in the head with a bat in the shallows.  You know.. actually fishing? As opposed to pretty much animal cruelty.
495092,figureight,2010-08-16 20:25:00,40," Hey genius, just because you hate salmon in the river every one should die before spawning? A large part of eastern trib salmon are naturally reproducing. These fish sustain one of the greatest fisheries we have here in Ontario along with the hard work of many volunteers (ie. Ringwood Hatchery). Give your head a shake."

495102,alexcba,2010-08-16 20:36:00,634,i've been practicing flossing on my self to get ready for salmon.. don't remember having the steak i pulled out from between my incisors..
495103,SudburyAngler,2010-08-16 20:37:00,154,this is getting funny
495108,misfish,2010-08-16 20:43:00,29133, Pretty stupid to me. This is going no where. Be civilized in your comments.

495120,SudburyAngler,2010-08-16 21:00:00,154,  but with such a topic being discussed it is bound to exceed polite and morph into a hilariosly rude and ignorant read
495121,danbouck,2010-08-16 21:02:00,4380,"ok update guys - I took the afternoon off work and found the ATM, and am currently on my way to the fish ladder. I think I may give everyone who catches a salmon there $100 of the ATM money, maybe!  oh and I also picked up some ear plugs at Rona"

495123,SudburyAngler,2010-08-16 21:05:00,154,  lol I think JPCT should get more for reporting the ATM malfunction

495134,alexcba,2010-08-16 21:16:00,634, tazers could get costly. i recommend a few car batteries.. just toss the jumper cables in the water and reap the benefits.  you may not wanna be to close to that btw.

494996,John,2010-08-16 18:25:00,2956, Easy for you to say..
494997,Guest JPCT,2010-08-16 18:26:00,0,"Its simple logic.  There was maybe 10 people on the trench the last 2 nights.  Tonight, there will be 5000.   There may be 50 salmon at the fish ladder, but now after this post, there aren't going to be any."

495005,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-16 18:32:00,0,  Ya think?...If there was 10 last night and they told two friends...there's be 30 there tonight and 70 the next...and so on till they're all dead. Anyone who has ever fished salmon in a river knows well when they start to show. Give it another couples weeks and it'll be a real hoot.

495009,Guest JPCT,2010-08-16 18:35:00,0, It was the same 10 people both Saturday and Sunday.  Only a few new people showed up at the pier. Most of them left when the tornado hit last night lol.

I hope they kill every salmon that comes in the river .. if i had my way  i would have the ladder closed to keep the fish out of the stream above ... Thank god they still have the screen on the ladder so the kids can swim threw it .. but Unfortunatly the salmon  still can .. they are even above the dam  on private water .... but seeing that i despise salmon so much in the river .. I WILL NOW BE POSTING DAILY UPDATES FOR THE SALMON IN THE GANNY .. PLEASE GUYS KILL EVERY ONE YOU CATCH ..

495079,Guest JPCT,2010-08-16 20:17:00,0, Yes.  But how can they spawn when they can't even make it past the Biway hole because theres 500 people there dredging treble hooks through the pool and chasing them around with nets and bats.
495081,TC1OZ,2010-08-16 20:18:00,987,Can someone post me a google maps link... I wanna head down there with some garbage bags tonight!
