I just signed up for a Youtube account, and the file is now uploading... one minute and change long and 500MB! Can you edit from Youtube once uploaded? It would be better I suppose to edit first and then upload (faster). Any suggestions on what program to do this with?"

If so google ""Windows Movie Maker Download"" It's free from Microsoft and they have it for all versions of Windows since XP. It's not uber powerful but it does the job plus you can add music, still photos, titles and transitions.  I did these videos with it.  Topwater Pike  Ice Fishing NWT  Salmon & Trout in Alaska"
