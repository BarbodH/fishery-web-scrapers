Anyone who even thought about fishing Monday should think about the wind, it was a tough day.  We headed out at about two and fished until about seven thirty after an excellent lunch I fished with my friend Dave and he set us off with a nice small guy in about ten feet of water wind side of weed hump   We kept fishing an as usual instead of musky these pesky big walleye keep eating my lures   After another hour I finally hooked and caught a monster the picture doesnt do it justice measure 47 and was really fat take a look at it walleye eating gut - i should have taken photo and made it look like a monster! I would say the heaviest fish I have caught. Came out a smashed my bait on wind side of some rocks. Maybe they are setting up for summer   We then went and fished for bass on senkos never had an opportunity to do this before and had a really good time. Might even think about doing this a little! was awesome fun"
