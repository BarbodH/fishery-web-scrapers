709768,saspirilli,2012-06-27 15:48:00,27," GOLDEN BOBBER 2012 - OFFICIAL RESULTS    JUNE 27, 2012 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE (HALIBURTON, ONTARIO): To all members of the OFC community – a sincere apology about the delayed posting of the results of the 2012 Golden Bobber Tourney. We experienced a server malfunction at head office and several files containing boat registration numbers, date of birth authentication and sponsorship affiliations were either destroyed or corrupted. We had to rely on our back-up server in Belgrade to authenticate the weigh-in statistic charts. As there was an extreme time-zone difference to contend with we were forced to postpone the release of the official results.  We would first like express thanks for the incredibly generous support of our new Platinum Level Sponsor, Cutty Sark Whisky. Cutty Sark ""Taste the Adventure, Not the Flavour""  We also acknowledge the continued support of our Gold Level Sponsors Weber Smokey Mountain Cookers and Heddon Lures - ""Rattlin' Spooks Since 1894"".  The winner of the “Cutty Sark Lunker Big Bass” was Piers Johnson of Toronto, Ontario who was aboard boat #82, “The Princess Bride.” Mr. Johnson boated a 4.4 pound smallmouth at 7:30am on Saturday, June 23 while dragging a Heddon Pop’N Image in “Bullfrog” Colouration through weed-beds in approximately four feet of water. The water temperature reading at the catch location was 74 degrees.      Said Mr. Johnson from the Golden Bobber Podium, “Many anglers have forgotten about the classic lures and presentations. Heddon products have been on the shelves and in my tackle box for years for a reason – they catch fish! Today conditions forced me to slow up my presentation, but ultimately the key was to get the lure where the fish were sitting.”  That evening, all tournament participants were treated to a massive BBQ and grill buffet banquet courtesy of the Pit Masters from Weber Smokey Mountain. These “Mayors of the Charcoal” offered up smoked pork side ribs, “Roy’s Belly Busting Brisket,” and lightly seared Gar Pike tenderloins soaked overnight in buttermilk to get most of the sour out.            ---------------------------- 30 ----------------------------  "
