710391,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-29 19:42:00,336,My wife and I have been looking at properties in the Dryden area.  My thoughts are to open a Quilt Shop in that area and to do a lot of fishing.  Maybe hire myself out as a camp cook (I wouldn't dare say  guide on this fine forum) or get a regular job or put all the eggs in one basket and work the quilt shop.  We really don't have enough money to retire but we are thinking about a change in venue.  Wife works for a consulting firm that designs nuclear plants but she doesn't have degree.  Her love is quilting and she is good at it.  I work for consulting firm that farms me out to Colorado Dept. of Transportation as a material tester and inspector and I also don't have a degree.  We are both good at what we do but feel like we are in a bit of a rut.  Am I off my rocker or just seeing the light?
710396,NAW,2012-06-29 20:00:00,4022,"I'm no quilting expert.  But I wouldn't think a quilt shop in Dryden would pay the bills.  It sounds like you both have very interesting jobs right now    Why not ride them out for a while, untill you can afford to retire?  How long will it be?  P.S.  This is advice from a low risk guy..  I wouldn't want to try to start something new, and end up loosing my shirt.  Then never be able to retire."
710399,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-29 20:12:00,336," N.A.W. Sound Advice, and I appreciate it!   I turn 50 next week.  I think the quilt business would be a online affair as well.  I need a hook or an angle.  Maybe hosting high end quilt retreats.  My wife has a pretty good name in this area and I would love for her to achieve her dream.  P.S.  We are both pretty impulsive"
710403,capt bruce,2012-06-29 20:17:00,820,"Sorry dude but I cant see a Quilt shop makeing it for two anywhere , In Dryden no thing is gonna pay your bills now , maybe twenty years ago but now , Dryden's best days are long gone ?? Still a great dream and Dryden is a beautiful place. If you and the wife can hang in untill some kind of pension is available the quilt shop as a hobby second (third) income thing will work ,  retire to Dryden and fish and quilt your days away, but if you have not got enough money behind you to live ????? . Sorry to be so negative , but it is what it is .."
710405,grt1,2012-06-29 20:19:00,638,"my wife and i are regular visitors to the Dryden area and she too is an avid quilter. it just so happens that the biggest quilt shop in Dryden is up for sale , not because the business is bad, the owner recently passed away from cancer and her sister who has been running it for the time being, is ready to retire and wants to unload it, so does the husband.  for your information the name is AJ Fabrics and the phone number is 807-223-8700 .  I don't know what kind of problems you would have moving into canada though."
710406,NAC,2012-06-29 20:22:00,369,"Can't really compare it to Dryden, totally opposite demographics. Then there's the whole patriotism thing."
710408,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-29 20:45:00,336," After reading your post, I called Roxann to let her know what you posted.  She found that information very interesting.  I thought it was funny that she already had the phone number to AJ's.  Thank you oh Grt1  P.S. I will pm you later to give your wife, my wife's email address.  I'd bet that they would find something to about"
710410,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-29 20:49:00,336," Thanks for taking the time to give me your advise Capt Bruce.   All good points!  I've got some assets, but it would be a huge risk."
710492,limeyangler,2012-06-30 02:51:00,5204,Am I owed some commision from someone here?
710495,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-30 02:57:00,336," Wife keeps watching videos featuring little Jack.  She tells me, I want to be fishing where this boy fishes!  Jack deserves it."
710498,limeyangler,2012-06-30 03:17:00,5204, I'm his agent!
