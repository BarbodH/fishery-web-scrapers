710027,rhymobot,2012-06-28 15:06:00,174,If I park my car at Lawrence Park does that mean I have to pay the $7 to launch my inflatable even though I wouldn't have to use their ramp?  Or can I just blow up the boat and set off somewhere from the shore or beach? I'd be using my trolling motor too.  Thanks.
710028,BillM,2012-06-28 15:09:00,17367,Isn't the $7 for parking as well?  I know it's like that at the Humber.
710040,rhymobot,2012-06-28 15:34:00,174,  Hmmm perhaps that is the case.  If I were gonna be there for several hours I have no problem paying $7 but I might only be on the water for an hour since it would be on the way back from the cottage and I have to make a couple of people wait.
710041,davey buoy,2012-06-28 15:34:00,5505,"I think you have to pay the $7,that road at the foot of Duckworth is closed at the lake."
710085,jimmer,2012-06-28 18:26:00,2730,"It's private property, so you should expect to pay. $7 is pocket change."

710090,jimmer,2012-06-28 18:37:00,2730,"Lawrence park is owned and operated by Melissa and Greg. That little dirt road has always been private to my knowledge, people just think that it is public."
710093,misfish,2012-06-28 18:49:00,29133, The first park is owned by John Mccan.Thats the one I was refering to. I never had an issue with the dirt road. Use to drop my canoe and just be on my way.
