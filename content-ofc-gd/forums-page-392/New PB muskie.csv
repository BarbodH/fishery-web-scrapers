710336,nancur373,2012-06-29 16:27:00,1211,I like making babies. No desire to stand junk deep in cold water all day. Not to mention I don't have a wooden net. Lol
710337,Headhunter,2012-06-29 16:33:00,5703,"Thanks Man! I'm here all week, try the veal! HH"
710338,BucktownAngler,2012-06-29 16:37:00,582,"good job, nice fish!  definitley go with a large net over a cradle. 2 hands are required for a cradle"
710340,GBW,2012-06-29 16:38:00,8460,Don't you mean the Sacred cows...
710347,John,2012-06-29 17:16:00,2956," Fishing with the proper gear also results in the occasional dead fish, unfortunately that is the price that we pay for participating in our sport. Maybe you would care to enlighten us all as to how you pick a large fish out of the net when you are fishing alone? Rather than just busting someone's   maybe you should offer more of your wealth of knowledge to our ignorant community......speak at a Muskies Canada meeting perhaps?"
710359,Live2fish85,2012-06-29 18:01:00,1633,Bladeburner your a goof. Try a PM. The only ignorance I see is in your post.  Get a life.  Congrats on the PB.
710398,spincast,2012-06-29 20:08:00,3279,"Congrats on the PB,  and successfully reviving and releasing the fish, who swam away."
710401,landry,2012-06-29 20:15:00,1005," This type of post makes Muskie anglers in general look bad. A vertical hold on a fish that size is fine, though not preferred. Way to welcome new Muskie anglers into the sport. Your arrogant attitude served no purpose. I am a teacher and I know from experience that being positive and then adding one clear and positive goal or next step is always better than belittling someone. This is a great site. Let's keep it that way!!!!!! landry"
710420,nancur373,2012-06-29 21:56:00,1211,It's ok guys I'm not discouraged. Next time I'll just lay it horizontal on the casting deck. That should keep them happy. Lol
710421,BucktownAngler,2012-06-29 22:01:00,582," no it won't  you'll have somebody complaining about the casting deck removing the slime off of the fish.  pretty much only horizontal holds are accepted around here lol  my advice, look into a camera mount"
710423,eman,2012-06-29 22:14:00,101,Beauty....lamprey wound?
710438,Dutch,2012-06-29 23:37:00,831,"Typical muskie post that goes south real fast.  I don't know why people even post reports about them....oh wait, most people aren't anymore.  Or posting reports in general.  To the OP - nice fish, thanks a lot for posting.  I'd say don't be offended, but it's hard not to be."
710443,Sinker,2012-06-29 23:57:00,8692,Nice musky and congrats on a new PB! Thats a great fish for that lake!  S.
710445,esoxansteel,2012-06-30 00:00:00,1307,"Very nice fish, and to beat your old PB by a foot is something to be proud of, as many guys have said, a large net with coated mesh is the way to go for fishing muskies, for the protection of you and the fish, it will basically be your in the water livewell, eliminating extra handling, as the hooks can be removed or especially cut while the fish is in the net, a top notch hook cutter like Knipex is essential and will last many years, I like to have my net and cutters and long-nosed pliers on tether straps attached to the boat, as they wont work at the bottom of the lake, personally i have a set of pliers and cutters on each side of the boat, depending on which way the musky wants to go. Once again congradulations  "
710455,nancur373,2012-06-30 00:13:00,1211, You obviously missed the joke there lol.
710456,nancur373,2012-06-30 00:15:00,1211,"Thank you. Very helpful info. This is what new guys like me are looking for. Again, thanks.  Curt"
710457,nancur373,2012-06-30 00:17:00,1211,That's what I thought. It was round quarter sized. But the fun was half missing too.
710500,Cudz,2012-06-30 04:30:00,2652,"Oh, the fun was all there, it was the fin that was missing.  LOL.  Nice fish. I want to catch one of those."
710516,limeyangler,2012-06-30 11:58:00,5204, HEEEHEEHEE...good one Nancur.   Great fish and congrats.
710517,Roy,2012-06-30 12:13:00,13728,"I didn't see the actual fish but just from the photo, and working with photoshop, both the scar and the sliced fin were done by a 40hp 4 stroke Honda (15 pitch prop). IMHO  Great fish Bud. Congrats!"
710258,nancur373,2012-06-29 12:45:00,1211,"Got up at five this morning. Walked to the dock. Wind was up and I thought about going back In the trailer for more sleep. Decided to go out anyway. Started out fishing top water. Nothing for a while. Put on a bionic buck tail and first cast FISH ON!!! good fight. I knew this one was bigger. Few leaps out of the water. Peeling drag. What a rush. Got it to the boat and realized my rubber net was way too small. I forgot to mention my buddy slept in so I was alone. Had to grab the gill plate. It was heavier than I'm used to. Sorry muskie guys but only way to get a pic was to hold it straight up and down real quick.   Got the hooks out quick and revived it and it swam off unharmed.   I noticed a quarter sized fresh wound on it's right side and the right front fin was freshly bitten or torn half off.  Caught at 6 am 44"" back to the trailer for 7: 30 for breakfast."
710260,lew,2012-06-29 12:49:00,12766,"Congrats on the new PB, she's a beaut !!  No need to apologize either."
710261,johnnyb,2012-06-29 12:50:00,3413,Gorgeous fish....nice way to wake up for sure!
710268,Gregoire,2012-06-29 13:25:00,1397,Nice ski. You are catching the fever. A bigger net and more lures are in your future
710273,nancur373,2012-06-29 13:33:00,1211,Gonna get a cradle I think.
710274,lew,2012-06-29 13:35:00,12766," A large net is much easier to use, specially if your fishing alone."
710275,Jer,2012-06-29 13:35:00,1426,  Not much use when you're alone.
710278,Rich Clemens,2012-06-29 13:56:00,3131,"Sweet.   Already a great feeling on a new PB.    Still got some more room there to do it again.   I seem to be stuck on 49"" for mine ....  one of these days."
710279,nancur373,2012-06-29 13:59:00,1211,So I guess a big net it is then
710281,Rich Nelson,2012-06-29 14:04:00,332,"And maybe the proper release gear if you are targeting Musky. You obviously know that vertical hold can be harmful to the fish, yet you did it anyway so you could get a pic holding it. Real classy...."
710282,mercman,2012-06-29 14:04:00,7054,Beauty !!!
710285,nancur373,2012-06-29 14:19:00,1211,There we go. That didn't take long. As I said in an earlier post I am new to this. I don't have an unlimited budget to spend on this. It wii take time. I like how you almighty muskie protectors act like you had thousands of dollars of gear your first time out. Go be a loser somewhere else.
710293,lew,2012-06-29 14:41:00,12766," It's a shame that so many musky posts go down the drain on this board but it's also the reason so many serious musky fishermen no longer post fishing reports here.....me for one.  nancur373, just ignore the remarks of guys that want to ruin these posts and continue to learn from other guys who don't think their perfect.  And when guys do complain about vertical holds, just ask them how they lift THEIR muskies outta the net if it's not a vertical hold until they can get 2 hands on it.  Some of you guys are just plain friggen pathetic.  Again nancur373, congrats on a nice looking fish and your new PB."
710294,John,2012-06-29 14:42:00,2956," And your :holier than thou"" attitude is why many of us don't bother posting fishing reports any more.........."
710297,frozen-fire,2012-06-29 14:50:00,542,"My question is:  Why is it OK for so many people to hold big pike vertically by the gills, and no one gets flamed for that... but it's always the muskies?  I personally hold any big fish horizontally no matter the species.  BTW, sweet muskie nancur"
710298,lew,2012-06-29 14:53:00,12766, Because muskies are special
710299,Headhunter,2012-06-29 14:53:00,5703,"I would have plucked it's eye balls out for Perch bait, so I think the OP was trying his hardest not to hurt the fish... chill out dude! I know that I would love to see guys like Lew post their pics, but guys like this make that only a memory around here... HH"
710306,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-29 15:01:00,535,"Nice fish! I still haven't hit the 40"" mark this year. Been raising some nice ones but only catching small ones.    If people are so worried about harming muskies, why not just give up fishing altogether? Geez, let the guy enjoy his catch!"
710314,pokerdemon4,2012-06-29 15:08:00,135,I've even seen pictures of Jim Saric holding musky vertically. He is the ambassador of the sport. I don't understand why the weekend angler can't. Great fish dude! Go get another and hold it however you like. It's your fish!
710322,Rich Nelson,2012-06-29 15:19:00,332,"  U dont need thousands to have the proper gear to target Muskies. You obviously know a little bit about what you should be doing, yet you decide to target skis anyway. To an angler that is completely ignorant of what they should be doing, theres nothing to say, because ignorance is bliss. Fishing for musky without the proper gear results in some dead fish... Period. Sorry for trying to protect a fragile resource."
710325,kickingfrog,2012-06-29 15:23:00,8333,Nice fish! Now where is that ten foot pole?
710327,tightline,2012-06-29 15:35:00,322,"Quit Busting the guys gear Bladeburner...I see you have all of 45 posts on here.  Not a great way to make friends in a great community...As the old saying goes ""if you don't have anything nice to say...Shut the hell up!!!""  Sweet fish Nancur, Congrats on your new PB!!  Don't let this guy make you feel bad about your catch, fish released unharmed, check! Say no more"
710329,Headhunter,2012-06-29 15:49:00,5703,I hope the OP goes trout fishing soon! HH
710333,jigsnreels,2012-06-29 16:08:00,133, x2  Nice fish.  Anybody who manages to take a gator like that solo can pick it up any freakin' way he pleases.
710334,GBW,2012-06-29 16:16:00,8460,"you go girl!  Gee HH, your on a role today...  nice fish man!"
