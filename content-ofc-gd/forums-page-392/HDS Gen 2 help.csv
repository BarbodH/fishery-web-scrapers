Didnt bring the riggers as it was a bass weekend so the unit got limited use.    1 questuion, is there a way of angling the side scan unit so as to see bass under a dock? May sound like a ridiculas question but I have a feeeling it can be done.    Found a tire in 80 feet of water near the south island. Yes it was a whitewall!!!      Thanks    darren"
709902,Terry,2012-06-28 01:23:00,14456,"well it can be done I angled a transducer years ago so I could have side scan on a trolling motor and it did work  however it would not work well for anything else, unless you could come up with some type of motorized pivot point to angle it when you need it and back strait down for normal use"
709990,ecmilley,2012-06-28 12:54:00,2163,you don't have to angle the side scan transducer to see under docks. i am assuming you have the lss-1 module and new hi def transducer i hsvr no problems looking under docks counting poles of docks following outlines of shorline structure up to 2 ft deep and 40 ft away the hard part is everything is much smaller then echo returns of traditional sonar
