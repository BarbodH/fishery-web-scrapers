Very excited to finally hit the ""blue water"" and it did not disappoint.In about four hours we must have landed upwards of 80 Silver bass between us,just non-stop action from start to finish.Here is a pic of one I caught.   Having never caught these before they were a lot of fun to catch.Just thought I would share my first outing and cant wait to try more of this river.It's going to be a great summer of fishing!"
