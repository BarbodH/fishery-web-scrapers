Is it possible to strip something like that? I could see the hole for the cotter pin, so I did put it in and the prop seems reasonably snug, just don't know what happened there? Everything fine or did I just ruin my fishing for tomorrow? I had the motor in gear while I was turning it if this means anything."
710458,ccmtcanada,2012-06-30 00:25:00,7971,"I had a 1983 Merc 18hp that did exactly the same thing.  While tightening it up, without a LOT of effort, it would loosen up.  Before each trip I did a quick hand check of the nut and it never ever came off.  I always had a spare prop handy just in case, but never had to use it."
710461,Rizzo,2012-06-30 00:38:00,4754,"Thanks Cliff. Hopefully its the same thing. Its not like I really torqued the thing, was just giving it a bit extra ""oomph""."
710462,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-30 00:40:00,10439,Could be the prop wasn't seated all the way on the shaft and that was just it slipping the last bit to seat it. The retainer/cotter pin will keep it from falling off if it's not quite all the way tight. That's it's job.
710467,Rizzo,2012-06-30 01:06:00,4754,"oh, there's a thought...maybe I should take the pin back out and try and tighten it a few more revolutions...see if it gets tight then"
710468,Terry,2012-06-30 01:08:00,14456, that was my thought too
710471,Rizzo,2012-06-30 01:27:00,4754,"Bing Bing Bing we have a winner, OFC to the rescue again. Couldn't take the suspense...pulled the pin back out, tighten another revolution or so and NOW its tight. You guys were right, was just shifting I guess...maybe that's what Cliff's motor was doing too!"
710476,ccmtcanada,2012-06-30 01:46:00,7971, Interesting!  Could very well have been the problem!
710477,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-30 01:47:00,10439,    FYI A little grease on the prop shaft and it will slide on better and stop corrosion.
710489,bigbuck,2012-06-30 02:12:00,2449,Don't tighten too much. Hitting a rock can make a tight prop nut a total bear to get off. Snug is good enough.
