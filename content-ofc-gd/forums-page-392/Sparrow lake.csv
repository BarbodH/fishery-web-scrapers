I ended up swapping my line for 12 lb braid because I lost about 5 lures to the weeds and whenever a fish wrapped itself in weeds, I was screwed..  good luck out there and when you get back put up a report as I will be heading up shortly!!!!"

If you can get on the water early and fish the edges of the channels before the daily parade starts, it's a beautiful weedline to work.  Otherwise, stay to the shorelines and bays....plenty of weeds so bring the heavy stuff.  Good bass fishing for sure."
