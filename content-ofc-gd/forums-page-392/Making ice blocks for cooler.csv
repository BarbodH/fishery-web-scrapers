709251,SirCranksalot,2012-06-26 01:30:00,3291,Why not keep the ice in the container to avoid having water in the cooler?   
709448,hooked!,2012-06-26 17:01:00,38,Great tip on adding salt to the water.  I'm going to try that tonight!
709968,scugpg,2012-06-28 11:53:00,1373, Hey Burt is there a chart somewhere on what amount of salt affects the freeze point? Is the ideal goal to still freeze the containers but freeze at -15 instead of 0 for example?.  Thanks!
709995,Headhunter,2012-06-28 13:11:00,5703,"If you have a large enough freezer, put your cooler in the freezer the night before your trip. You loose so much ice making a warm cooler cold at the beginning of the day. A frozen cooler will keep ice and everything else cold much longer. HH"
709997,krixxer,2012-06-28 13:15:00,274,After reading this I went into the kitchen and made 3 ice cubes  1. water + sugar 2. water + salt 3. just water    after 24 hours I took out the tray and started my timer.  first to melt was water + salt at 45min  water and sugar took 1 hour to melt  after 1 hour and 15 min the ice cube with just water still had a little pebble of ice floating around in it.   conclusion: Beer is cold enough with simple ice and it will be cold longer then with other ice mixtures.
710020,kickingfrog,2012-06-28 14:42:00,8333,But you didn't take the temperature of your solutions. The ice/salt/water would have been below zero degrees Celsius. The water/ice would not be below zero.
710140,Burtess,2012-06-28 22:04:00,901," I attached a chart from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Saltwater_freezing_point.jpg  Your freezer must be able to attain a lower temperature than the freezing point of the salt solution, or it will not freeze, it will just get cold but stay liquid.  Whatever the freezing/melting point of the solution is the important as this is where you get your steady temperature plateau, and where the liquid/solid mixture will maintain a temperature until all solid is melted.   This makes sense as all three cubes started at the same temperature, but they progressed through their melting profiles in different ways.  The first to hit and maintain a lower than 0 temp was the salt water, the second the sugar water, and the third the fresh water.  But they all melted at different temperatures, the salt water much colder than the fresh.  Normally any contaminant added to a ""pure"" substance will alter the freezing/melting temperature. This is why I stated I use a mix of salt water bottles and fresh water bottles in my cooler.  The salt water bottles will be melting away (at somewhere below 0C) while the fresh water bottles are still rock solid.  Once the salt water has fully melted, the temperature of the cooler will rise to around 0C and the next melting plateau will begin when the fresh water melts.  Once this is done, the temp will climb to ambient temps.   Kickingfrog had it, this is the key...  Burt"
710143,kickingfrog,2012-06-28 22:12:00,8333,Ice/salt and water will also chill your beer the fastest. Great when you buy at duty free and are tailgating at the Bills game.
708697,scugpg,2012-06-24 16:09:00,1373,"I'm going to start making my own ice blocks and refreezing them during outings. I was wondering what you guys like to use. Currently using frozen water bottles, but thinking using something bigger will last longer.  Anyone have any suggestions for a container that will hold up over multiple freezes? Like milk jugs etc?  Thanks!"
708698,kickingfrog,2012-06-24 16:15:00,8333,Not quite what you are talking about but I often use plastic ice cream containers and put the ice in a zip top plastic bag.  Most Gatoraid comes in heavy plastic bottles that survive multiple freeze cycles.
708700,rmarentette,2012-06-24 16:26:00,124,I often use large juice bottles. Just make sure you don't fill right to the top. You can refreeze them and reuse them multiple times.
708701,scugpg,2012-06-24 16:28:00,1373, Sorry about that - Looking to freeze containers and throw in cooler to keep the fish cold
708703,SirCranksalot,2012-06-24 16:46:00,3291,"I use 1 L juice containers---cranberry etc, squarish so fits well."
708705,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-24 16:54:00,10439,I use rectangular tupperware containers to create my ice blocks. I pop the block out of the container and place them in the bottom of the cooler.
708711,Fisherman,2012-06-24 17:13:00,7201,"Some of the 2 and 5 litre plastic vinegar containers use thick plastic.  I have an extra large 10 litre one for longer trips, usually goes 3-4 days."
708715,NBR,2012-06-24 17:30:00,163,"I've used everything from refreezable bags  through gallon, quart bottles and soda bottles but my favorites are Gator Aid bottles. I usually take Gator aid and the pack the cooler with Gatoraid bottles filled with water and then frozen. Usually I drink the GatorAid first the the water as it melts.  Works for me."
708718,fish_fishburn,2012-06-24 17:40:00,1311,I use the plastic bags from do-it-youself wine kits. The plastic is very thick with a good snap on cap. Have been using the same bags for over two seasons now. They hold well over a gallon of water. I use them in my cooler and livewells.
708730,Fish Farmer,2012-06-24 18:32:00,2234,"I refill 2 litre Pop bottles with water and freeze, then put a couple in my fish box cooler. You don't want ice melting over the fish because it makes for a slimy soup. Keep them (fish) dry, less mess. My Walleye, I bleed out in the live-well first, then in the cooler."
708731,Pikeslayer,2012-06-24 18:38:00,1443,Great tip! I do the same. Fish taste better when bled/cleaned right away and then put on ice.
708738,scugpg,2012-06-24 18:53:00,1373, Hence my initiative. It makes a big difference in the taste of the fish and much easier to clean.
708745,Burtess,2012-06-24 19:19:00,901,"Whatever bottles you choose to use, try adding 150-200g/L (5 to 6 tablespoons per litre) salt to the water.  This should freeze totally in a deep freezer and melt at a temp of -10 to -15C, it will keep your cooler much cooler!  Burt"
708755,Fish Farmer,2012-06-24 19:53:00,2234,I'll have to give that a try. So you say salt slows down the melting of the ice?
708758,Burtess,2012-06-24 20:02:00,901,"  Depending on salt concentration, it lowers the freezing/melting point of water to a maximum of around -21-22C (this is with a ""saturated"" solution, in which no more salt can dissolve in water). Salt doesn't slow the melting, it melts at a lower temperature.  A frozen water bottle will maintain 0C until all the ice is melted.  A frozen bottle of salt water will maintain a temp. of much less than 0C until it is melted. I like to mix regular ice with ""salt"" ice in the cooler, so you have two cooling plateaus, sometimes the beer can have ice crystals in it.  Burt"
708760,Handlebarz,2012-06-24 20:03:00,3790,Like others I use 2L bottles or rectangle bottles like sunny D been using them for ever and a day. I use 2 old 500ml water bottles in my lunch to keep it cold I re freeze them daily still no leaks they gave been around for a few years
708763,misfish,2012-06-24 20:31:00,29133, Yes bye.
708773,kickingfrog,2012-06-24 21:03:00,8333, Just make sure that saltwater bottle is marked cause no one wants to have a gulp of that on a hot day.
708775,dave524,2012-06-24 21:10:00,4508,"I must be the only person that uses those freezer packs with the blue gel like goop inside, couple big flat ones on the bottom of the cooler and a few smaller ones for on top of the fish. I found they last longer than ice , rinse them off and refreeze."
708776,Burtess,2012-06-24 21:10:00,901," Lol.... yes they are... all the ""ice"" bottle are without labels but labels do fall off the good bottles in the cooler quite often so it would be easy to mix them up.  Burt"
708777,big guy,2012-06-24 21:11:00,414,"I have a novel idea for frozen blocks in the cooler.  Buy 4 L jugs of water, pour a little out the top as they will expand when frozen. Then when the water begins to melt, you have fresh, cold water to drink. No screwing around with other types of containers, no cleaning, just straight forward and logical. Been doing it for years."
708788,scugpg,2012-06-24 22:04:00,1373,"Great tip on adding salt to the water thank you!  For the guys that bleed out fish and leave in the cooler, do you add a bit of water to the cooler as well or just let the fish sit between the blocks to keep cold?"
708867,Canuck2fan,2012-06-25 01:19:00,1444,"I used to use Chapman's large ice cream square tubs. Fill to about 2"" from the top turn upside down grip the top edge and the ice would pop right out.. The only draw back was having to use up the crappy ice cream first. The chocolate ice cream mixed with chocolate milk made a fair milkshake it was the only way I could stomach the ice cream LOL."
708870,Fish Farmer,2012-06-25 01:28:00,2234,"Thanks Burt for the explanation, I'll be given it a try. Who said you can't teach an old dog new tricks"
708981,johnnyb,2012-06-25 13:38:00,3413, x2  If you have trouble getting the ice out....just run some hot water on the underside of the tupperware itself.  Blocks rock!  Cubes are for rubes!
