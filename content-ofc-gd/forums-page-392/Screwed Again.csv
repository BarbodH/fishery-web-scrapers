Thinking I could beef up the arsenal for my trip to the Northwest Angle I ordered a classic jerk from them. I forgot to check what company was doing the shipping. The rod arrived today and the fees were almost 80 bucks. I could have bought it here for cheaper, and it would have been the new model. Just a reminder to all of you. Check to make sure that anything you order from the states is shipped USPS, otherwise you may get screwed.  Rant over."
709684,Terry,2012-06-27 08:50:00,14456,yup they do it to us every time they can UPS is the worst
709698,mike rousseau,2012-06-27 11:39:00,4661,thats when knowing people along the border is nice...they can pick up your package at a fedex store...bring it across the border... then ship it to you...  i order to ny state and its a 10 minute drive plus customs each way to pick it up... and i buy my gas over there anyways so the trip doesnt add to the cost of the rod...
709712,Harrison,2012-06-27 12:04:00,2202,"Sorry to hear Fishgreg, very frustrating.  We hear it quite often in my line of biz.  Even with USPS you can get dinged Tax and Duties. I hear some folks get it without the extra fees, but mine seldom do.  Especailly with a larger item like a rod, they always seem to pick it out."
709717,mike rousseau,2012-06-27 12:19:00,4661,  And rightfully so... But you shouldn't get hit with USA taxes... You get taxed based on your billing address...  Like when I order something to a NY address and my billing address in Canadian... I pay no tax... Unless the customs officer decides to make me pay...
709747,johnnyb,2012-06-27 14:36:00,3413,"Just wondering.....can't you send it back?  I mean....tell whoever's holding it that you don't want to pay the fees, so they can have it back?  I suppose you've already paid for the item itself though....not sure how it would work."
709835,Snidley,2012-06-27 20:54:00,620,I was looking to buy something off the St Croix web sale as well. I asked about brokerage since I had been burned before and they explained to me that a 2 piece rod can be shipped USPS parcel mail and would cost  around $20 to Canada  but a one piece rod is too long for USPS so it has to go courier. They warned me it was a significant cost and $80 surely is exorbitant. They did have some great deals at St Croix recently but my taste runs to 1 piece rods and shipping by courier tears it for me.
