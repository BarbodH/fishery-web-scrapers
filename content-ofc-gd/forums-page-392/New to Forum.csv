710026,Luke V.,2012-06-28 15:06:00,286,"Thought I would give everyone a little intro on myslef.  Im 21, Live in Niagara-on-the-lake for the past 5 years. I grew up in St. Catharines. Currently working at TRW Automotive as a Mechanical Engineering Co-op student. I also work part time at Bicknell Racing Products. Fishing is my main hobbie and has been for the past number of years. I grew up with a fishing rod in my hands spending summers with my parents at different cottages and camping all the time. We still go camping every year as a family for two weeks to Cedar Lake in AP. In 2005 my Mom was diagnosed with MS. Over the year long diagnosis she came to a point where a walker was her best friend and she was wheelchair bound. Dealing with this reality really changed my outlook on life. In less than 12 months my mom went from being an energetic outgoing person to someone who was so limited in the things she could do. Walking became the most difficult task for her. Which ultimately lead to the wheel chair. This forced my dad to either reno our entire house or move. We were fortunate enough to be able to buy a peice of land in Niagara on the Lake and build a custom home the suited all of my moms needs. From a roll in shower to appropiate countre heights and an open concept that made getting around much easier. Shortly after the construction began my moms health greatly improved! The Drs had been trying all types of different drugs and we stumbled upon one that brought my moms life back. Slowly she transitioned from the wheel chair back to her walker and then back to being able to walk all on her own! This was truly amazing.  She continues to battle with her MS everyday! We thank God for the miricale that happened in my moms life with her regaining her mobility. Fast forward to 2011. As moms health is continually increasing to get better, my dads health began to diminish. In the spring on 2011 my dad started to become extremely tired day in day out. Being only 49 this was totally odd for him. With some visits to the dr's and trips to hamilton (which everyone in my family was familiar with) the Drs began to diagnose my dad. By Novemver of 2011 my dad could no longer work and we still didnt have a diagnosis. The Drs knew he was producing some form of canerous protien but where it was coming from was unknown. Finally after a kidney biopsy it was determined that his kidneys were producing this protien. Upon further investigation it was determined that my dad had Primary Amloidosis. This disease is pretty rare with only 3000 diagnosis's every year in North America. Game plan was to have my dad go through a bone marrow transplant early in December. This would hopefully stop the growth of the protien and maybe kill lots of the protien. With the transplant being done right over christmas it was a little of a different christmas for our family. My dad was admitted to hospital on the 20th on december and returned home on the 5th on January.(one day before his birthday). The recovery was a slow and long process but my dad is back to work now full time. His body continues to make the protiens and they Drs cant seem to figure out why. He has been taking chemo by pill everyday for the past 2 months. If you wish to know the full story on my dads journey please read the blog I created for him. (Edvisser.com)   I know this post seems a little depressing, but the past 7 years of my life have taught me more then I might learn in the next 20 years. It has certainly brought my faimly closer together. My two brothers and I learned what real responsibility is taking care of our parents and providing the income for our family for 8 months.( along with many gracious donations) Fishing has become something that I charish even more now. The time I am able to spend on the water with my dad means everything to me. All I know is that I live everyday to its fullest becasuse you never know what is around the corner.  Here is a pic of my dad    Tight lines.  Luke"

710084,Spiel,2012-06-28 18:23:00,9065,"Nice to have you here Luke.  MS is an insidious disease that robbed my youngest brother of a normal life in his early 30's though he is a fighter and actually is out and about more than I. I give him 2 big thumbs up for his determination, a published poet, a certified sailor and even some hang gliding (passenger) to his credit, he's awesome!  My best wishes to you and your parents, a tough row to hoe at any time in life.  Oh and thanks for the PM's yesterday, nice chatting with you and I look forward to meeting you."
