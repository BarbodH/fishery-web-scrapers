G spent the night at a friends down the street and saunters down as soon as I pull up. We do the meet and greet thing, and I ask him, ""did ya miss me?""'Sure did Dad - when can we go fishin?"" ""ummmm, think we gotta clear that one with Mum' 10 seconds later "" she says its OK, what time we leaving?"". Ahh, a boy after my own heart.  Sunday 4:30 we're up and bound for the regular hunting grounds. The Lake is coming alive. On the water by 6:30, first two bows in the boat by 8:30, 1 more bow and a Salmon in by 9:30 (that woke G up from a quick snooze when it hit the dipsey and peeled about 100 foot of line off immediately) and a couple near misses, including one bow G fought  for 250 + foot just for us to watch him jump fully 3 foot out of the water twenty feet from the boat and spit the hook.  Just as we're starting to pull in the line the lead core that I had just switched up spoons on 10 minutes earler goes for the first time, 10 + coluors out. Starts peeling line. This fish fought so hard G actually asked for help, which he didnt even do with the Salmon he landed earlier this year  Nice 33 inch bow we agreed would be a dad-lad team fish  We ended up 5 for 9 in 4.5 hours. Other than one (less than 24 inches) they were all over 29 inches and healthy as I've seen them."
