709086,whiskywizard,2012-06-25 17:33:00,305,"I'll be interested to hear the MNR/CO answer.  In Ontario, ALL fishing is governed by the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997. It doesn't matter whether it's a lake, pond, stream or puddle. Even the guys at the indoor fishing shows with the bass in the big plexiglass tractor-trailer tank come under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act (""24.  (1)  A person may, without a licence, engage in aquaculture if the fish are cultured in aquariums.  O. Reg. 664/98, s. 24 (1)."").  The way the OP describes the pond, I think he could be charged if he were to fish it OOS.  Normally, to be a private pond, open year-round, the uncle would have to satisfy the requirements around the source of the fish. If he could show they were purchased from a licenced aquaculture facility and the pond was stocked, you could then harvest those fish as you pleased. You'd just have to follow the rest of the act; e.g., can't release a fish, etc.  But the pond was stocked before those requirements came into effect and hasn't been managed. And it isn't a licenced aquaculture. So I think the MNR would argue the pond contains naturalized fish and all seasons and limits apply.  <BR style=""mso-special-character: line-break"">"
709087,Gerritt,2012-06-25 17:41:00,6129,"  Thanks Joe, given the situation I am in time has been extremely limited... but both my ex and I have been trying to figure out a plan to make exactly what you said a reality..... I have to rely on other family members though to make it happen..... not always easy given their schedules etc...  thanks for chiming in"
709088,Gerritt,2012-06-25 17:45:00,6129,"  Receipts are not possible. As this property was stocked before he purchased it... the farm was inhabited around 1897 and the pond was dug as a measure for fire suppression.. This is very common on farms... and infact will reduce your insurance premiums as the fire dept has a source of water to put out a fire....  It was the previous owners grandfather that stocked it.... kind of hard to go back three generations to obtain a receipt.....  I am waiting to hear back from the MNR.... and will certainly update everyone involved.  Thanks again folks,  G"
709786,Dara,2012-06-27 16:38:00,3052,"Personally, I wouldn't think twice about it. His pond on his land and his fish. Why should the government have anything to say about it. I wouldn't even ask them."
709797,Dutch,2012-06-27 17:07:00,831,Seems to me a moot point. MNR will probably never come knocking.  Hope you didnt give specifics they may make it a make work project.
709807,northernpike56,2012-06-27 17:43:00,717,"Exactly. just go for it, its his own pond, his fish, It wont have any effect on anything else go drop a line in there once in a while... nobody can say that they have never broken/twisted a law before.. driving at 115-120 km/h on the highway is technically illegal.. but you don't see people getting pulled over for that."

There are zillions of land owner ponds getting fished against the regs i tend to agree little harm to do..but your efforts to find out are a good idea..maybe keep your inquiries low key..."
708989,Gerritt,2012-06-25 14:00:00,6129,"This past weekend I was able to spend a considerable amount of time with my son    we went to a small town called Havelock and stayed with my aunt and uncle in their spacious 5th wheel trailer...  it was awesome!  My uncle owns a farm with a large pond on it... that is teaming  with  largemouth and large sunfish that were stocked 20+ years aGo These fish have never seen a fishing lure....  My question is does a small privately owned pond, on private land still fall within the MNR mandate and their open and closed seasons etc?  thanks for any and all replies   G."
708990,Twocoda,2012-06-25 14:07:00,4130,"Im going to take a guess and say no...but if it has a natural ""navigable"" feed then i would think it would...."
708991,cram,2012-06-25 14:21:00,1733,"I would say no if it is not connected to any waterway, whether navigable or not."
708992,dave524,2012-06-25 14:22:00,4508,"You still have to follow the seasons and limits when hunting on your privately owned land, why would fishing be any different?? I think those public pay by the inch trout ponds are licenced in some way and are possibly exempt though.  Would you shoot a duck out of season on that pond, if not why would you take a fish out of season?"
708995,Gerritt,2012-06-25 14:29:00,6129,Add to this one more twist.... My uncle does not have a fishing license.... he has not fished since he was a boy...... so would he need a fishing license in order to fish his own pond? for his own fish? fish he owns...? say he wanted to thin them out.... what would the law be here?   G
708996,Joeytier,2012-06-25 14:30:00,3990,Because the ducks were not stocked by the landowner...
708997,cram,2012-06-25 14:39:00,1733, Stocked fish.  Unless they came in as eggs on birds feet or something.
709000,glen,2012-06-25 14:46:00,2641,If you cant go fishing when you want without a lic on your own pond then the laws are stupid.
709002,dave524,2012-06-25 14:47:00,4508," No, not ducks, but I have released young pheasants on private land many years ago and we did have to wait until opening day. Again, the pay to hunt pheasant operations are licenced and do get an exemption. Generally the land owner does not own the wildlife even though it is on his land, it is the Crown."
709005,Musky or Specks,2012-06-25 14:50:00,2710,"No, fishing laws do not apply to man made privately stocked lakes that are not connected to natural waterways. No license, no limits, no gear restrictions, no season."
709007,Sinker,2012-06-25 14:53:00,8692,"If its a stocked pond, and has no in/outflow, he can fish it all he wants, and whenever he wants.  If it has in/outflow, he has to follow the open seasons.  S."
709008,bigmac1984,2012-06-25 14:53:00,193,"I found this on the MNR website, someone with a similar question that was answered, but I suggest just calling the local CO and asking specifically:   WATERS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY â€“ APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS   Question Re: Private Property I own a large parcel of land with a good sized spring-fed pond on it, the pond drains off of my land into a near-by river. I know there are fishing the pond, do I need a licence to fish in the pond and do the seasons apply on my property?    Answer: Because your pond has an outflow the laws requiring a licence and the various fishing seasons would apply to your pond. The Ontario Fishery Regulations, which contain the rules for sport fishing in Ontario, apply to all water in the province with the exception of National Parks, waters that are licenced under an aquaculture licence and waters that occur on private lands that meet all of the following conditions:     If the pond meets all of the list above the fish must then come from a licenced aquaculture facility or a licenced commercial fish operation; they cannot be caught by sport-fishing and transferred to the pond.

709009,fishnsled,2012-06-25 14:55:00,3520, That is what I was told by the MNR a few years ago when I contacted them with the same question Gerritt.
709012,Gerritt,2012-06-25 15:04:00,6129,  The pond is spring fed (underground) but has no outflow... but it doesn't lose water either... it is always consistent.  thanks for all the replies guys... I have sent a email off to the MNR for some better clarification... as we need to rid the pond of some pike that have somehow found their way into the pond... No idea how that happened... pulled out two over the weekend..... but caught a ton of Bass and some monster sunnies! I will post a full report later on.  Thank again everyone for your comments..... looks as though I have found a year round honey hole  G
709015,dave524,2012-06-25 15:10:00,4508, Does he have a bill of sale for the fish? Or is it a naturalized population from a white bucket transfer from a nearby water body many years ago? I would tread lightly if fishing outside the fish and game act.
709016,Musky or Specks,2012-06-25 15:10:00,2710,Pike often get into ponds that are on a floodplain if this is the case then the rules change as noted above. The pond is spring fed but did someone create the pond by digging it out? If the pond was a natural formation again the rules change as noted above.
709020,Gerritt,2012-06-25 15:16:00,6129,"  Nope... man made.... dug till they hit the water table.... 25+ feet... Water has NEVER had to be added to the pond, nor have they ever had flooding... and they are a long ways away from the nearest body of water.... I assume either a bird (Hawk, eagle etc) MAY have dropped one in years ago.... or there was some sort of screw up when the fish were purchased 20+ years ago... or it could have been someone stupid thinking they were getting rid of minnows...  who knows    all we know is we did not stock pike.... nor has there ever been a flood or has the pond ever spilled over....   G"
709024,cram,2012-06-25 15:33:00,1733, Wouldn't matter if aliens from the future beamed them there; he wouldn't be fishing outside the fish and game act.  Fish eggs come in to private ponds on birds all the time. Could be how your pike got there.
709049,kickingfrog,2012-06-25 16:21:00,8333,"Managing water bodies is tricky stuff. Part science, part art and some voodo. Some pike may not be a bad thing as they would keep the panfish and small bass in check. I've fished a few ponds that had nothing but 1lb bass in them. Boring!"
709052,dave524,2012-06-25 16:27:00,4508," Read bigmacs quote from the MNR very carefully, the last line seems pretty clear, The fish must be planted there from a licenced source if all the conditions apply, fish that naturalize in a pond through other means do not apply."
709067,cram,2012-06-25 17:05:00,1733," It does not say that fish naturalizing in a pond through other means apply.  Here`s one for you - you and your neighbor each have ponds.  You stock yours with trout, and he stocks his with bass.  Bass will likely end up in your pond via birds.  Are you then not allowed to fish in your own pond because a duck with eggs on it`s feet swam in it?  As long as you're not catching fish and transporting them yourself (which would be a worse fine than fishing out of season)."
709071,Gerritt,2012-06-25 17:19:00,6129,"  Agreed Rob.... we are just trying to remove a few as he was seeing dead bass with markings on them.... meaning they were attacked, but not consumed... he figures he may have 5-10 pike in there... solely by seeing them..... he wanted to have a few removed to help manage them, and let the Bass and Sunfish have a fighting chance....  It was insane fishing to say the least... one cast... one fish    needless to say my son was more then thrilled! I am uploading photos now to begin a report  G"
