710022,ehg,2012-06-28 14:45:00,2666,I remember when 1 million hits happened around 2004-05 or so. When the board changed in late 2006 it really took off.  Congrats on the continued success!  Mainly same moderators the whole time. Must have something to do with it.
710025,Jds63,2012-06-28 15:00:00,1365,"amazing, I am sure there are many companies out there that would die to get traffic like that to their website !!!!!  more reason to keep your spots secret ...."
710054,aplumma,2012-06-28 16:04:00,6896,Thanks to all of the members for making this site a part of their lives.   Art
710065,bare foot wader,2012-06-28 17:03:00,1354,"this is easily the best fishing forum I've found, both in the layout and functionality of the forum, the quality of the posts/replies and for me especially the classifieds, BC is crazy expensive, i still purchase a good deal of my stuff from home and with shipping it's still cheaper  I don't post too much but love reading the posts(esp pics) of ontario fishing...I relocated from ON to BC during the olympics and still read this forum more than any other"
709631,Roy,2012-06-27 02:08:00,13728,"Well my friends, sometime tonight we will have surpassed the 70 million mark with people visiting the community. That is only for half of the years that we have been in existence. It might not sound like big numbers for everyone here but I know that if it's not the top, it's at least in the top three in North America. So, on behalf of all the administration staff, I'd like to thank everyone for your contributions in whatever way. Whether it be reports (we love pics), questions, answers to questions, or whatever post you decide to share. Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Just thought I'd throw that out there cause I'm very proud tonight.....ok ok...every day I'm proud of our accomplishments.  Be well."

709643,Roy,2012-06-27 02:18:00,13728," With 70,000,000 visits, we don't need hockey talk.  Although, we could accept SOME hockey talk during hockey season. Or maybe post fishing reports in the hockey boards eh? I'm sure they'd enjoy that."
