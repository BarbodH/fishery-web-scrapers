709972,Roy,2012-06-28 12:01:00,13728," Tell your buddy that while he's down there at the cannonball anyway, drop in a depth probe, temp at the ball, PH level and a sender back to the LCD screen on the rigger and he'll have a winner. It wouldn't take a genius to do it...just somebody way more gifted than me."

709991,NAW,2012-06-28 12:55:00,4022," That's a good idea.  Then you can control the angle of the camera too.  I guess the benifit of the GO-Pro one, is that you can send it way back away from the boat, near your lure."
