With this cold weather, I'd bet your typical ""small lake"" has between 6 and 10 by the end of this week...hard to say though with all the snow cover."

In haliburton forest, any lake that froze after the big snowstorm has plenty of ice (they staked them with 8"" about a week ago). Smaller lakes that had frozen before the storm and got snow on top of the ice only had about 1"" on them."
