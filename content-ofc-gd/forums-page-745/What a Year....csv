418687,karma,2010-01-05 00:34:00,6,"2009 was an incredible year.  A number of new talking electronics were sea-trialed, 14 fishing excursions were hosted involving 34 youth and adults with vision loss and 74 recently disabled vets, and key-note presentations were given at fishing tournaments involving a total of 546 fishers with vision loss.  Outreach activities included 14 presentations and exhibits at six outdoor events for a total of 182 hours.  Additionally, feature articles in 15 fishing journals and mainstream papers and over 45 minutes of TV and radio time all contributed to get the message out about the importance of ensuring the sport of fishing is open to the over 11 million Canadians and Americans with vision loss.  The below links will take you to featured reports of Maestro my guide dog and my adventures on the water.  A big thanks to my sponsors for their tremendous support and all those who volunteered their time and expertise.  I very much look forward to working with all of you in 2010 as the Blind Fishing Boat initiative reaches out to even greater numbers of people with vision loss and their families and friends.  Best to all of you in 2010.  Be sure to drop by and say hi at one of the up-coming Ottawa or Toronto Sportsman or Fishing Shows.
