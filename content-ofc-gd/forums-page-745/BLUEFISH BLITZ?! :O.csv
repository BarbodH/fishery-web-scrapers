418185,aplumma,2010-01-03 15:49:00,6896,"you should see them here in the Cheasapeake when they blow out balls of bait. It is cast, hook catch, start the boat and follow repeat till you are tired. We call it gun and run as you look to the sky for diving birds then you just follow the school until the action stops.   Art"
418186,rbaquial,2010-01-03 15:53:00,968,"  I used to go to the Cheasapeake a lot growing up... fishing for PORGY, then when I got older.... eventually for BLUES!!  I LOVED GOING THERE!!"

418382,Ben_Daniels,2010-01-04 01:11:00,435,How come this never happens to me when I'm surf fishing in Cape Cod?!   Somewhere I've got a picture of a 13 pound PORGY I caught is South Florida a few years back that would have been an IGFA record if the rod hadn't been handed to me from a charter boat captain   would have beat the old record by almost 5 pounds!  -Ben
