418447,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-04 04:48:00,0," this made me laugh out loud. my wife asked me what i was laughing at and i responded ""nothing dear""... i'm such a coward!"
418448,Kinger,2010-01-04 05:08:00,351,Our rapids stay 'soft' and hold fish all year long.
418527,cityfisher,2010-01-04 16:07:00,959,i do both BUT i wish i could be in the bahammas for the winter and come back for walleye opener
418565,nancur373,2010-01-04 18:34:00,1211,I enjoy both. But soft wins
418567,Dozer,2010-01-04 18:43:00,896,"Soft water by a landslide...  No freezing, cruisin' in the boat, beaches, swimming, snorkelling, cold beers, girls in bikini's...I may have missed a few..."
418570,Jds63,2010-01-04 18:48:00,1365,I enjoy both very much .... however softwater fishing has the edge because i can get the family to come out ... i also purchased a small boat which now really opens up a lot of choices where to fish
418641,Leecher,2010-01-04 22:39:00,7832,I like em both and chose hardwater for the simple reason that there is no bugs.... the day I get sting by a bug on hard water is the day I quit ice fishing LOL  Leechman
418645,jediangler,2010-01-04 22:46:00,1923,"This is easy.  Ice is for playing hockey on and keeping your drinks cold, not for fishing."
418676,limeyangler,2010-01-05 00:01:00,5204,ICEFISHING FOR ME!
418683,johnnyb,2010-01-05 00:22:00,3413,Go hard or go home!
418716,tibbs,2010-01-05 01:34:00,650,"I voted for softwater, but I haven't tried ice fishing yet. I bought a bunch of ice fishing stuff this weekend. Hopefully i get to try it out soon.  "
418080,rbaquial,2010-01-03 04:20:00,968,Here's an interesting topic...  Explain why you prefer HARDWATER (Frozen) over SOFTWATER ....or vise versa...
418081,danbouck,2010-01-03 04:23:00,4380,I prefer softwater since the wife won't wear her bikini on the sled!
418088,pike slayer,2010-01-03 04:49:00,1177,i almost like hardwater fishing then softwater fishing. i find ice fishing soo much more of a challenge and thrill but nothing beats the feel and thrill of going out on the boat on a warm sunny day and hooking into some nice fish.
418090,rbaquial,2010-01-03 04:51:00,968, Vote Dude... I'm actually REALLY interested in the outcome of this poll.
418095,Joeytier,2010-01-03 04:58:00,3990,"I really don't see how hardwater stands a chance. I love both, but softwater definitely takes the cake."
418112,richyb,2010-01-03 05:50:00,774,I like both seasons but I get laid off for the winter and get to fish ALOT more than in the summer. I chose winter.
418114,Twocoda,2010-01-03 05:58:00,4130,if they had hardwater in july...then i might try!!
418127,dave524,2010-01-03 10:33:00,4508,Glad I live close to the Niagara River so if I really want to go fishing in the winter I can actually go fishing.
418128,lew,2010-01-03 10:57:00,12766,"Definetely soft water for me, from early spring till the season shuts down mid-December.  Standing on the ice staring down at a frozen hole is sorta like watching bowing on TV  There's other things in life rather than fishing and winter is the time for them.  Course, that's only my opinion"
418136,Greencoachdog,2010-01-03 12:48:00,8163,  Nope!... there's fishing........................... and that's about it!!!
418137,Rich Clemens,2010-01-03 13:08:00,3131,"Softwater for me.  That's an easy one as I've never had/taken/desired the opportunity to sit my butt on a slab of ice.  Of course, ya never know until ya try it.  But, a day out with good friends may just be the ticket.  Someday I may give it a whirl, but my fishing buds down here don't ice fish either.  Whatcha think GCD.  Just pick me up on your way through.   A little Lakair GTG in January ... you can build the camp fire.  We'll just cut a hole in the ice, shove the boat down through, and off we go.  There's some softweater underneath that hard stuff ..... just gotta be.  Observed at: Greater Sudbury Airport 8:00 AM EST Sunday 3 January 2010 Condition:Light Snow Temperature:-20.1Â°C Pressure / Tendency:102.0 kPa / falling   (Hey - don't fish bite better on a dropping Barometer ?) Humidity:69%  (Might be kinda sticky and sweaty out there) Wind Chill:-32 Wind Speed:NNW 28 km/h gust 37 km/h  I guess I just don't like winter much."
418144,walleye_man,2010-01-03 13:42:00,135,thats a tricky one i love jigging for walleye in the winter but frogging for lmb is deffenitly the way to go i think i vote softwater
418148,Greencoachdog,2010-01-03 13:52:00,8163," Trolling in a submarine might be fun Rich!  I actually enjoy hardwater fishin', but I hardly ever get to do it... but whenever I'm up north during the season I always go.  ... but if I gotta choose between one or the other, it ain't gonna be hardwater!"
418158,Roy,2010-01-03 14:34:00,13728,"I figure that any woman who sees her hubby crawl out of her nice, warm, cozy bed at 4AM to go sit on the ice in a cardboard box in -30 temperatures has got to be questioning the strength of her relationship to him."
418159,jaydub,2010-01-03 14:48:00,145, LOL  I haven't been hardwater fishing in a long time and I'm definetly gonna give it a whirl again this year but (in the interest of my marriage) I won't be getting up at 4am for hardwater.  My vote goes for softwater hands down.
418160,Fishnwire,2010-01-03 14:48:00,983,"If I could figure out an effective way to use top-water baits through the ice, I might like winter more...ice fishing is fun though.  In Sudbury the ice season is almost four months, so it is a big part of my year.  Still, I prefer the summer.  God, I wish it was July right now!  A couple of times my buddy and I fished for crappie in the summer and fall from the docks of his marina but ""winter style.""  We'd use our ice rods (just one per guy of course) and vertical jig for them with a flasher unit.  It was fun to get a little taste of winter fishing in shorts and a tee-shirt."
418162,Greencoachdog,2010-01-03 14:57:00,8163," Well if she was the wife she's supposed to be, she'd already be up and have the coffee and sandwiches made... and the truck loaded up and warmed up!!!"
418166,Fishnwire,2010-01-03 15:09:00,983,"  Hmmmm....  My wife is pretty good and knows how important fishing is to me.  She's more accomadating than some other guy's wives I've met.  That said, if I requested that kind of treatment I'd go thirsty and hungry and have a cold truck with no gear in it, of this I am sure."
418168,fishboy,2010-01-03 15:13:00,550,Who says we have to choose? lol
418171,Fisherman,2010-01-03 15:18:00,7201,"You should have added another option such as ""both"", some softwater days are miserable due to rain or bad winds, thunderstorms, etc, hardwater days can be just as bad with miserable cold windy conditions.  The the weather allows, I like both."
418317,icedude,2010-01-03 22:44:00,459,Really--Curious minds need to know i guess  DUDE:      Love them Both-soft water/hard water--fresh or salt-saw Mercer doin the Bone Fish Thang on TV briefly today--got to go when the budget can afford it-on my Bucket List  Married a  Girl 23 years ago who knew my passion going in-so whatever the Season--welcome home--warm arms-Smile and please clean that in your shop-- make my own lunch TMI  OK--Softwater is my vote--but not to fish locally for a few months--is pain--gots to embrace the ICE if you live on Lake Simcoe  Stay Safe  Good Fishin
418323,Whitespinnerbait,2010-01-03 23:10:00,2038, And after a quick nap start focusing on having a nice hot supper waiting as you walk in the door....
418337,fishyfingers,2010-01-03 23:30:00,46,"I think both are fun, they each have benifits. I obviously gotta love nice summer days fishing, and BASS..  but there is something about getting out there on the ice too. I don't have a sweet boat so being out on the ice allows me access to water I can't always get to."
418371,scuro2,2010-01-04 00:35:00,904,"I went ice fishing once, everyone was getting wasted and then someone noticed a fish on the line."
418429,JoshS,2010-01-04 02:58:00,729,I prefer soft water any day but when you have to fish winter months in Canada you really don't have a choice but to fish through the ice.
