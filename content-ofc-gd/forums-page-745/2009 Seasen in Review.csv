418347,msp,2010-01-03 23:47:00,1336,"To the OFC crew, Hope everybody had a great and safe 2009. I thought that I would share some of my more memorable moments of the softwater season. After I complete this post I will get all my rods out and clean them up and store them till next spring. Enjoy the pics.  WINTER AND SPRING I didnt get out very often for steelies this year but I had a pretty decent March hanging out in the bottom end of the creeks on the north shore of Lake Ontario. A little porn for the steelheaders.........      OPENER      SPRING PIKE I look forward to this time of year. Here are some of my favorite pics from this spring......       BASS Finally its here. I told myself that I would fish a few new lakes this year and managed to learn ( sort of ) five new bass waters. Caught some great fish this year but still didnt catch that ""nickle"" this season.          FALL PIKE Its funny how things go full circle. We are blessed in southern Ontario with all sorts of fishing to be had. I wish everybody a great 2010. See ya next spring.      P.S. Photo bucket sucks"
