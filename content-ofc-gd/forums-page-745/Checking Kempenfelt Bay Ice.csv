To my surprise there was no ice at all (except for the marina and Bayfield st wharf, just lots of steam rising up into the -20 degree air.  I know Cook's Bay always freezes way sooner but I was expecting at least a layer on Kbay.  Looks like I am going to have to make a trip to Guiford next weekend."

418184,Meegs,2010-01-03 15:49:00,249,still wide open this morning! wont freeze this week with the winds...      hope the winds die on thursday!
418258,johnnyb,2010-01-03 19:11:00,3413,"I was afraid of that....just checked the reports and it's nothin' but wind.  Is there much concern that they'll start to break up the ice in Cook's, or should we be okay there this week?"
418441,Cudz,2010-01-04 04:05:00,2652,I will check it Wednesday but with the wind blowing there has been too many waves out there.
418518,Meegs,2010-01-04 15:51:00,249,"a bunch of actual ice flows out there this morning in between the steam!     She's ready to go, just needs the wind to co operate for a day or two!"
418581,cityfisher,2010-01-04 19:34:00,959,hopefully in 2-3 weeks the whitey grounds are good to go
418709,Meegs,2010-01-05 01:25:00,249,i drove by shanty bay later this afternoon and it was solid ice as far as i could see...   ive been getting reports of the same thing off BBP BP and innisfil beach!    Might be good to go at somepoint mid next week
