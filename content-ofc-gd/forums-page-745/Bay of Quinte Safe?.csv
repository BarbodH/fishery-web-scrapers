416969,gaspumper,2009-12-31 00:36:00,393,"Check ""www.quintefishing.com lots of reports there."
416993,Joeytier,2009-12-31 01:31:00,3990,"Big Bay would be your best bet given where you're coming from.  Stay away from narrows like Telegraph Narrows or Massasauga point, and you'll be on lots and lots of ice.  I was on about 6-7 inches today."
417822,fishyfingers,2010-01-02 04:44:00,46,"I was just going to ask the same question about the ice condition on the bay of quinte...  Anyone know where I can find a good detailed map of the lake so I can stay clear of unsafe areas? I am coming from Kingston, any suggestions where I should go? I am just a bit worried about the ice"
417931,fishyfingers,2010-01-02 19:17:00,46,"Was out on the Bay this morning... in case anyone else is wondering there was lots of ice, about 6 inches thick. We had no luck though, only a couple perch. I am new to fishing the BOQ and somewhat of a novice ice fisherman, so maybe I was just in the wrong place or didn't know what I was doing lol.. I know there are big ones in there, might go back again next weekend. Hopefully better luck for me then."

418033,Joeytier,2010-01-03 01:42:00,3990,Slow day today.  Was on the ice for about 6 hours with only a few jumbo perch and some missed hits to show for it.  It seemed like everyone else was also drawing blanks.  Big Bay has a solid 7-8 inches of good ice now.  Lots of machines out there.
418320,fishyfingers,2010-01-03 23:03:00,46, So it wasn't just me then? Good to know
418421,tibbs,2010-01-04 02:45:00,650,Thanks for all the replies. I didn't get to go fishing since i had no time.
