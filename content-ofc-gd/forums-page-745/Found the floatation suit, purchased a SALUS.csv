418642,Guest buick14,2010-01-04 22:40:00,0,"Thank you very much for all the suggestions....I did a lot of research, and tried on several different suits, and in the end the SALUS suits were the winner  The one piece endurance series is what I ended up getting...I was looking for a suit which was lightweight and comfortable, with a lot of mobility and was happy to find both in the same suit.  I will do a review when I get back from my trip, and let everybody know how it performed  Thanks again for everybodies suggestions, to wkrp, and also Steve Wagner of Salus marine for being such a great help  If you were looking into getting a flotation suit, look into Salus, there's a special 20% off for those who attend the boat show and go to their booth just to let you know..  thanks again!"
418646,wkrp,2010-01-04 22:47:00,656,Look into the Salus suits . Made in Kitchener. Got one for Xmas --- incredible
418664,Pigeontroller,2010-01-04 23:27:00,2793,"A couple of things...Make sure its comfy sitting down, not too short cause you'll notice it then. If you're using it for Ice fishing you'll probably want some room under it but I doubt you'd wear a full winter coat under it, just some layers of poly pro and fleece.  If I fell in 0 degree water I'd want a one piece suit!!!"
418665,uglyfish,2010-01-04 23:33:00,981,"i have a one piece mustand suit. i prefer a 2 piece, but only cause i find it more comfortable. one piece will keep u warmer, but i find it harder to move, and since i have a hut, i like being able to take off my coat for comfort. make sure u try on different sizes, mine is a medium and find it kinda tight and would have gotten a large if i had that option. i dont find that the suit keeps me warm enough though, not the best wind protection. u should look in the the arctic armor suits. they are waterproof, windproof, breathable and they float. will keep u warm if u fall in the water. thats ur best bet, id look into one of those."
418668,Roy,2010-01-04 23:38:00,13728, I'd probably want a crash helmet.
418672,Guest buick14,2010-01-04 23:45:00,0,are the salus and arctic armour suits also transport Canada approved..?
418675,Greencoachdog,2010-01-05 00:01:00,8163,"No, they're not USCG nor CCG approved yet.  Here's some of their videos you can watch that shows and explains the suit to you, you can also purchase online there too.  http://idigear.com/video.php"
418686,Rob,2010-01-05 00:34:00,467,  The Salus are here is the the copy and paste from their website:  All Salus coats and suits are Transport Canada Approved. All Salus coats and suits conform to CGSB Standard: CAN/CGSB-65.11-M88  Rob C
