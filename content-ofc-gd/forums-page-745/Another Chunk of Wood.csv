418782,workwear,2010-01-05 04:56:00,592,just curious what type of stain and varathane did you use.....  looks like a very nice piece
418801,Dara,2010-01-05 13:12:00,3052,  No stain one coat of linseed oil to bring up the grain. One brush coat of blonde shelac and then wax.
418072,Dara,2010-01-03 03:53:00,3052,"I started this cabinet last winter. The finicky drawers kinda got to me so I put it aside for a while...spring, summer, fall, finally got enthused around Christmas.  "
418074,Dara,2010-01-03 03:57:00,3052,"     again..saw, hammer and chisels for all the joints      Thanks for looking guys...this one is for sale  wife says we have no room for it"
418094,walleyejack,2010-01-03 04:56:00,358,"Very nice, well done !"
418097,Twocoda,2010-01-03 04:59:00,4130,I see you have a distinctive style about ya...based on the last table you produced and this very beautiful piece !!!!  your first woodworking post actually stimulated me to the point of getting out of the water and managing to get my garage in order ( some what ) for some winter projects....i dont think i complimented you on the other tables in this forum ...but i did in the woodworking forum you belong to ( im a new member there)...of the build thread...nice job..  ....im new to this woodworking sport at a furniture level but its alot of fun and im keen to learn...  is that bloodwood for the drawer faces?  i can only hope to be of your caliper at any point of my learning ( pssst but i think im going to use the power tools for joinery instead of the painstakingly craft that you obviously posses )  Kudos to you Dara  If you have any plans for a newby that might challenge me ...feel free to pass them along after i learn how to make a chair
418102,pike slayer,2010-01-03 05:11:00,1177,good work! and with all hand tools impresive! i'd like to see a close up of some of the dovetails on the drawers to see how good you actually are
418104,douG,2010-01-03 05:15:00,2693,"Fabulous work, flush drawers are painstaking, and those look perfect.  You are rightly proud of the hours of care that went into that."
418105,SlowPoke,2010-01-03 05:16:00,2984,Nice work Dara. May I ask what the motivation was for the different stain colour on the drawers and their layout? It looks as though you could have stacked the large drawers and had 3 small ones together. Layout and colour for character?
418107,Dara,2010-01-03 05:27:00,3052,"Thanks guys. I appreciate the comments The wood is not stained. The cabinet and legs are walnut. The red drawer faces are African Paduk. The brown ones are brazilian Jatoba. The drawers are beach, it has been steamed to give it a pink colour. This is a James krenov style cabinet. he molds different woods and grain patterns to lend character to a piece. It is my first one of this style. Worm dangler, stop by sometime and I'll show you in person. Nothing is perfect, but there is less wrong all the time."
418109,pike slayer,2010-01-03 05:46:00,1177,"i was guessing what the types of wood they were and i got them all right but the beach wood on drawer sides. i figured they would be either a birch or maple. lots of time and money went into that piece. if i remember correctly walnut was $14 a linear foot. and jabota isnt cheap either. i worked at black loon for a year and went and did my first portion of my cabinetmaking apprenticeship. it was amazing working with all different types of woods and some really expensive ones to. a great site to check out is www.forloversofwood.com and no its not a porn site haha!! they are out of cambridge ontario. i went on a tour there, very impressive! great place to order different and exotic woods from. ya one day i'll have to stop by and check out your craftsmenship and chat it up!"
418126,lew,2010-01-03 08:58:00,12766,"Very impressive work  Dara, specially cutting the dovetails by hand !!  You've made some beautiful furniture and it's really good to see you posting your projects lately"
418146,Radnine,2010-01-03 13:48:00,1538,Is there a name for that style of building Dara. It's kind of a stand-off/Shinto/futuristic thingy. It is very cool and would shine in the right decor. Congratulations again. Jim
418267,Gerritt,2010-01-03 19:45:00,6129,"Very nice!.. I did my carpenters apprenticeship in a millwork shop (as well as a thousand other things) but.. he was a master wooden shipbuilder from England and kicked my arse daily.. and to this day I thank him.. the miserable wanker/tosser.  anyways, very nice Jatoba can be difficult to work with... as it is hard and brittle.. Have you ever worked with Ipe? I have seen this wood shatter with my own eyes on a table saw.. get a little chatter and it will explode like glass..  Be careful with the Jatoba.. as it can bleach in funny ways... (this is why it is not an ideal choice for Hardwood flooring)  Nice looking piece of furniture. I assume you used a dovetail jig.. Hard to tell but the mortise and tenon look nice on the front stiles as well.  Over all a nice and different looking piece. I would like to see some more pictures in detail  G."
418272,Dara,2010-01-03 20:05:00,3052,"Radnine, it was done on this mans style. http://jameskrenov.com/furniture.htm He passed away a couple months ago and will be missed in the woodworking world.  Gerrit please see third picture. That is my dovetail jig Mortise and tennons were all hand cut and chopped. I have had jatoba crack and split on me. the paduk is the same way. It makes a good table top. Jatoba is actually marketed as ""Brazillian Cherry"" for hardwood flooring.  Thanks guys..just putting the finishing touches on 3 jewelry boxes and a table I have on order."
418273,danbouck,2010-01-03 20:10:00,4380,Just amazing work!
418278,msp,2010-01-03 20:43:00,1336,What great passion you have. Nice work
418285,Jds63,2010-01-03 20:58:00,1365,fantastic work i really like that style
418287,Twocoda,2010-01-03 21:06:00,4130,Dara .....i can only imagine the hours that goes into a piece like this ...but if you dont mind ...im almost scared to ask...what is the selling price for this piece?
418373,radar,2010-01-04 00:42:00,138,Beautiful.
418538,sirfish,2010-01-04 16:49:00,175,Beautifully handcrafted..but what would you use it for ?
418549,Dara,2010-01-04 17:30:00,3052,  That would take more imagination than I have
418582,Flappn,2010-01-04 19:36:00,245,Very nice work! Good job.
418631,bubbles,2010-01-04 22:07:00,591,"Great work, are you going to put a price on it?"
418638,Leecher,2010-01-04 22:31:00,7832,Awesome work Dara Craftsmanship at it's best Keep up the great work!!! Leechman
418640,edmichit,2010-01-04 22:37:00,145,"just curious, what is the woodworking forum mentioned?"
418760,Dara,2010-01-05 03:37:00,3052,  This is the Canadian forum  http://forum.canadianwoodworking.com/  as far as price goes...to build one for somebody I would be looking at around $500.00 to dump this piece I would like to see $300. If nobody snaps it up quick it may go to a friend that needs a large jewelry cabinet but I have seen plans for better jewelry specific cabinets that I would rather make for her.
