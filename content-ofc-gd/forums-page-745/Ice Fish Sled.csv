417385,GoneFishin,2010-01-01 01:40:00,349,"I've been looking around and can't seem to find a sled I can use to haul all of my gear around with. Canadian tire sells a couple but they look to small. I need one that will allow me to load my hut witch is 74"" long, my auger, minnow bucket, heater/propane tank, fish finder, chairs and my fishing equipment such as my rods and tackle.  What does everyone use for one? Is there some where that sells sleds for transporting gear? (around Oshawa)"
417389,Fisherman,2010-01-01 01:56:00,7201,"Go check at BPro, they have the bigger Otter sleds, you can just about go canoeing in one."
417538,ChrisK,2010-01-01 14:34:00,2772,Go to TSC stores and ask for something called a calf sled. Its a plastic type sled farmers use to bring the new born calves of the field in the winter...Heres a few other links http://goodoutdoors.theshoppe.com/calf_sled.html https://www.thefishinhole.com/index.cfm?ima...;PRODUCTSEARCH= http://www.ufa.net/PDFFiles/Livestock/5050...ng-Supplies.pdf
417635,fishermccann,2010-01-01 19:21:00,655,If you put all that gear in your sled you will need a machine to pull it!

417658,bare foot wader,2010-01-01 20:03:00,1354,you can make a sled pretty easily and depends how fancy you get but can easily end up being cheaper than buying one.....1/4 plexi for the bottom and it'll pull nicely
417659,GoneFishin,2010-01-01 20:04:00,349," Thanks I'm going to try to get to a TSC store tomorrow, I almost got the chance to go to basspro today to pick one up but that's not happening now...  I'm not to worried about being able to pull the sled. It can't be much harder then loading all that gear up onto ""my self"" and trying to walk out to my spot.....  Thanks for the help guys, if any one else has a good idea of where to get one I'm still open to suggestions lol."
417674,Riparian,2010-01-01 20:45:00,269,"at one time I searched around for months looking for a cheap sled to pull my gear in, couldnt really find the appropriate piece of plastic so I just went and bought one designed for ice fishing. Its an Otter, It was well worth the 60 bucks.  "
417884,ChrisK,2010-01-02 15:58:00,2772,Just got back in from Canadian Tire in East London. They have the sleds !!! $69.00 for the large model and $23.00 on sale for the smaller.The smaller one is on sale 40%off....The smaller one also looks like it would sufficiently haul enough gear for one person or at least my gear......
418249,GoneFishin,2010-01-03 18:45:00,349, I couldn't manage to find the large sled when I went there yesterday. But I picked up 2 small ones.. It doesn't look like there will be enough room with both of them still plus my auger drags.. I am thinking about cutting off both backs and bracing them together to make a 6'5 sled. Still not sure what I'm going to do.
418318,Fang,2010-01-03 22:46:00,1330,"That 74"" hut may be a bit awkward to fit a store bought sleigh around. Easy Fix - make one youreself. I made this one a few years ago and it's super light and easy to pull. It carries 3-5G buckets and my auger and tackle box.  I'll be putting it up in the classifieds soon and most likely building another to use up some of the extra materials I have kicking around. You can usually pick up a set of cross country skis at a Thrift shop or salvation armey outlet for $5-$10. A few sticks of lumber from Home depot and you can make it to fit any size and width.  This one is 18"" wide x 48"" long and the seat is 19"" off the ice   Ditch the seat and widen it out to carry the sleigh. Instead of the straight slats you could easily make a box on top to carry your extra gear and strap the seligh on top.  Too bad your in Oshawa. I'd offer my shop/garage and a few hours time if you were close by to build something that fit your needs"
418525,cityfisher,2010-01-04 16:03:00,959,checked out the one for sale at Crappy tire... too small for me .. wont even fit my gas auger..  the ones at BPS look good.. the big one is 129.99 i think ...almost a good idea to pickup the clam 2 man  for 250( they were on sale back in nov)
418614,ChrisK,2010-01-04 21:10:00,2772, Would they work attached side by side ??? End to end may create quite a week spot in the middle especially with the ends cut off of them. If they are side by each you could build a hinged platform type box with bunjie cords on a second level up top for more storage ??? Just a thought.....
418632,glen,2010-01-04 22:09:00,2641,Fang you got a nice looking sled.  Home made is the only way to go.
