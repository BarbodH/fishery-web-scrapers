417706,HTHM,2010-01-01 22:40:00,4082,"After a long and detailed search, (I now have a real good understanding of Craigslist   ), a bass boat has been found and hooked. This is a long awaited purchase, I researched and looked at countless ads for bass boats and others too, before making the choice to buy this one. I will need to do some work to it, carpet and seats. but the hull is quite sound. As well, there seems to be an issue with the shifting mechanisim, that I feel confident I can fix. (Thanks Boatman!) So here it is in all 17' 10"" of wonderful lines.....     "

(I would rather have the man who taught me to love fishing and the family ties that come from it, but....)"
417730,Whitespinnerbait,2010-01-01 23:20:00,2038,Serious looking ride right there...    Congrats.......
417733,Radnine,2010-01-01 23:30:00,1538,Slick the way you subliminally slid the free advertising in there Albert. Congratulations on the new ride! I have seen you work wonders with construction adhesive and am sure you will have no problems with a bit of carpet. Jim

417988,misfish,2010-01-02 23:44:00,29133,"I had the 350V Albert.  It had a 115 and did 54 mph with a 5 up stainless.You should get a few more hp,but your motor is much heavier then the 115 I had.  I would definitly look for a stainless porp for that motor.  Enjoy."
417998,uglyfish,2010-01-03 00:09:00,981,i believe i seen u towing ur new ride today around 11am at mud and centennial... heading east.
418003,ColdH20guy,2010-01-03 00:21:00,312,can i ask how much u saved buying it in the US and was it a hassle bringing it over? cheers!
418019,HTHM,2010-01-03 00:51:00,4082,"Yes you did I was on my way back from my brothers, he was giving me advice on repairing the trailer fenders and ways to shine 'er up."
418021,HTHM,2010-01-03 00:54:00,4082,"I did save bringing it over, but I did not have the ability to give it a good check out before pulling the trigger. Bringing it over was very easy, give US 72 hours notice, and show up at Canada customs, pay the duty and go. All in all about a half hour."
418023,uglyfish,2010-01-03 00:58:00,981,nice lookin rig! hope u get the repairs done ya need and she brings u lots of happy fish slimey days!
