418334,rylan,2010-01-03 23:25:00,134,"I am taking my brother ice fishing next week end, and I was wondering where you would go? I live in the Belleville area, and I know the BOQ is the place to be- so i am hoping for some advice on where would you rent a hut. Money is no object, and was thinking a ice bungalow, or some REAL nice service. Any help would be appreciated"

418339,Fang,2010-01-03 23:34:00,1330,Jeff C on this board also runs guided trips for walleye. So far his posts show he's on fish.
418341,rylan,2010-01-03 23:37:00,134,forgot to mention   I would like to stay over night- and not with a guide-
418348,Fang,2010-01-03 23:48:00,1330,check Belleville hotels and do yourself a favor book with one of these 2 guys. The bungalow or fixed huts don't move with the fish. You could be getting nice accomodations but this is a fishing trip and you want to be on fish first and foremost. If your not getting bit you can pull lines and move to a new spot. Check out Jeff C's posts. If I was booking my first trip to quinte that's what I'd be doing. There's some decent hotels out there and some night life.

Without one, you could end up sitting in one spot wasting most of the day.  Just my $0,02"
418376,James Houtby,2010-01-04 00:54:00,2,I was with Jeff C this past week and he put us onto fish. I have not fished there in 15 years and I called Jeff up and he did a excellent job. He can arrange accomadations for you also as he had done for myself. Here is a pic of a double header of a 9lbr and 7.5lbr that I caught and one of Jeffs friends. Here is a link to his website.  http://www.quinteicefishing.com/
