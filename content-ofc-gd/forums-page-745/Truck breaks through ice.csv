Larry Bartlett told The Nugget that a diesel truck with a plow fell victim to a pressure crack Saturday about 1.3 kilometres from land.  He said it should take about a week to recover the truck.  ""There's a minimum of 10 inches of ice, but we need at least 20 to 25 inches,"" Bartlett said.  ""Right now we're working at building up the ice."""
418559,mbosh1980,2010-01-04 18:08:00,349,Anyone ever see the episode of dirty jobs where they were recovering a truck through the ice up in Alaska? Fairly involved operation. I'm not sure I would ever trust ice enough to take a full size vehicle on it.  Just my opinion.
418568,Dara,2010-01-04 18:45:00,3052,I'm pretty sure insurance doesn't cover that.  Is the owner going to be charged with any environmental things?

418610,Roy,2010-01-04 20:59:00,13728,Attrition???
418611,BUSTER,2010-01-04 21:04:00,1336,
418617,Dara,2010-01-04 21:19:00,3052,  I gotta call my insurance company. I'm pretty sure they said they wouldn't cover my sled going through. I will ask if my truck is covered too.
