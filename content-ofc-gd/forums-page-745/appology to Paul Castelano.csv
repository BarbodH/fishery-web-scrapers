418365,johnnyb,2010-01-04 00:19:00,3413,Nicely done...thanks for making OFC a little classier

418407,dheitzner,2010-01-04 01:57:00,314,"I'm glad you guys worked it out, good on you for making this post."
418514,Dave Mercer,2010-01-04 15:37:00,148,"Hi Guys, Not sure what happened over the weekend but all I can tell you is Paul is a great guy. Glad you worked it out. He is one of the best  guides in the world that's right I said world! He knows the water, the fish and is a super pro with his clients. I have meet many great guides and many not so great guides and I will tell you Paul one of the best in the world. Also a great guy you will leave at the end of the day fishing with Paul with a new friend. Not only a great guide but a great person we need more people like him in our sport he really cares about the future.  Just my thoughts."

418551,Ron,2010-01-04 17:35:00,1683,"I always said"" Be the bigger man"".  Good on ya for stepping up and admitting failure Dax.  Ya wanna pick on someone, pick on this Dave Mercer guy, who is he anyways?     "
418626,Crazyhook,2010-01-04 21:43:00,1154,Might want to take down your original posts as well Dax
418627,Terry,2010-01-04 21:54:00,14456, now everyone will go back and look for them...LOL
418695,Rizzo,2010-01-05 00:49:00,4754,"I already did go looking (yesterday) and finding. I guess that's why I didn't comment until now. If Dax's original ""claim"" was inaccurate, I think there should be more than an apology. Should be a retraction of the statement (ie I was wrong) plus an apology. If the original claim was accurate then no need for apology as far as I'm concerned, even if he is a ""nice guy""."
418696,Gerritt,2010-01-05 00:51:00,6129,"Well done. It takes a man of character to admit when he is wrong and apologize for it.  Kudos to you,  G."
418708,Rizzo,2010-01-05 01:24:00,4754," I guess this is my point (see above). I don't see any admission of being wrong. I just see ""Turns out he's a real good guy and I feel bad that I've said negative things...not going to take any of the statements back, just wish I hadn't said them because now I like him"""
