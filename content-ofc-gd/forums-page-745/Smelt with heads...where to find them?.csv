418344,tnt,2010-01-03 23:43:00,63,I have checked around and all I can find is smelt that have been gutted/be-headed.  Does anyone know where I can score some smelt with heads in the Niagara area?
418377,James Houtby,2010-01-04 00:56:00,2,The smelts are starting to show up in the lower Grand River now if you want to catch some.
418392,SBCregal,2010-01-04 01:24:00,688,"ive seen them at the fortinos around here, and price choppers as well  i was looking for them earlier on in the spring for ice-out pike...had seen them once and couldnt remember where.  months later i saw them at the 2 stores mentioned"
418401,Dara,2010-01-04 01:44:00,3052,"Around here we find them in the rivers in the spring time..heads, tails, innards,,,and they are even alive.  A guy told me its illegal to sell whole smelts as bait...this true?"
418423,tnt,2010-01-04 02:42:00,63,Thanks for the info everyone.
418439,Kinger,2010-01-04 04:02:00,351,"yeah as Dara said, I get a year's worth of smelt for free every spring.  You just gotta go stand in a river for a while.  Its iffy about the sale of smelt as bait because some places it;s ok to use as bait and in other places it's illegal."
418442,FisherMike,2010-01-04 04:08:00,108,even headless and gutted they are a great pike bait!!
