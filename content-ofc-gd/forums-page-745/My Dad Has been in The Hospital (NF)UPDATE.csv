418345,Mike the Pike,2010-01-03 23:43:00,3421,"I must say thanks to you all for your kind words and you really boosted my moral.  The last few weeks have been a difficult time for our family.  My mom is back to health and is much stronger.  My father has been in the Hospital for 23 days he so looking forward to coming home. His diverticulitis has heeled quite well but the aortic aneurysm has been causing him a great deal of pain. Unlike a regular aneurysm my father has a rare case where it has formed into a bubble. I have been happy with our medical care he has received but dissapointed that all was put on hold for the Chrismas Holidays.Dad is supposed to have surgery either Monday or Tuesday to have a stent inserted in the aneurysm.He is nervous as the area affected is in a high risk area of the abdomen. Of course the Doctors always advise you of what could go wrong piercing of the bowels ,loss of both kidneys and many more possibilities etc....  I did go ice fishing for the first time yesterday around 4pm on the St-Lawrence river near the Champlain Bridge. One lesson learned never go ice fishing without my ice hut when I bring my young 11 year old son. I was warm of course after drilling 7 holes with my 8 inch manual auger.I must get rid of it either go to a 6 inch or a gas auger just too physical; my arms were as pumped as Popeye.Was frustrating I set up all the lines 5 tip ups and 2 holes for jigging so after all that work Ryan says he his too cold the foot warmers were not working and it seems his hot paws did not keep his hands warm enough.Had 2 hits off the tip ups but did not get there soon enough because I was too busy setting up.Ryan ran up to the car while I picked up all the lines and ice fishing gear.I did see quite a few eyes landed from others in the area.I will be back this time with the 2 man Frabill.We are aloud 10 holes each in this area far too many holes to drill by hand.I will be back at it soon hopefully with success.   Thanks to all of you for your support during one of lifes unpredictable detours. Mike the Pike"

418431,JoshS,2010-01-04 03:02:00,729,"Sorry to hear about that Mike, I hope everything turns out ok. Looks like you got a lot of good support here.."
418463,Spiel,2010-01-04 11:21:00,9065,Thanks for the update Mike. I hope all goes well for your Dad today (tomorrow?).
418464,Rich Clemens,2010-01-04 11:26:00,3131,Best of everything for your Dad's surgery.  Keep your faith high and your Dad's too - everything will come out just fine.  Keep us posted.
418472,solopaddler,2010-01-04 11:45:00,8605,"Thanks for the update, glad to hear your dad is fighting."
416001,Mike the Pike,2009-12-28 15:50:00,3421,I have not been around for a while ON Dec 12 my Dad was admitted to the Hospital he has been there ever since.  It took a week to find the pain in his abdomen which was Diverticulitis a blockage in the intestine.  The doctors have been successfully treating him for that.  During his stay my Dad had an MRI scan and they found a much more serious problem an aortic aneurysm.  He will require major surgery to remove the aneurysm not without risk I am told.  So far it has been 17 days he has been away from home which has been hard on my mom.  They both missed Christmas dinner which has never happened.My mom caught the flu and was too sick to attend Christmas dinner or visit Dad.  So far I don not know when Dad will have the surgery as with the Christmas break there were few Doctors working at the Hospital.  Do any of you folks know someone who has had this operation and how was the outcome?  I am so looking forward too my Father's return home.  I did notice a couple of weeks ago hearing that DanC would have his Dad home for Christmas which I was happy to hear Dan I hope he is doing well and on the mend.  This has been a gloomy December so I could use the support from OFC members!  Mike the Pike

416012,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-28 16:07:00,2582,Take a deep breath... relax... and know that we are all hoping for the best for your dad as well as your mom.  Sorry I can't help with any of your medical questions.
416020,Handlebarz,2009-12-28 16:40:00,3790,sorry to here the news Mike I hope all works out for your father we will be thinking of him and your mom.
416028,douG,2009-12-28 17:17:00,2693,"That must be a busy time for you, Mike, with Pa in the hospital, Ma with the flu, and then there is Christmas.  Hope it all works out well for your family."
416031,misfish,2009-12-28 17:20:00,29133,"It,s always harder at this time of year. Prayers for all of your family,as Im sure everyone is feeling it.  Chin up Mike."
416033,bigugli,2009-12-28 17:23:00,6138,"Sorry to hear you and your family have had a rough Christmas. I hope all goes well for your Dad.  On the medical question, all depends on the size and location of the aneurysm. I've known folks with operable aneurysms, most being successful, and others, like my Gram, who were inoperable."
416043,danc,2009-12-28 17:40:00,4677,"I hope that everything works out for you and your family Mike. The fact that your Mom has the flu surely doesn't make things easier. Although my Dad is now at home, he still has issues. My Mom stayed healthy during our ordeal, but she is exhausted. They say that time is the greatest healer. I hope that it does just that for both of us.  All things aside Mike, best wishes for the new year.   Dan"
416044,irishfield,2009-12-28 17:42:00,26272,"Mike... glad they caught it now, while they can operate and I wish your father a long life after it's done and repaired! Gloomy Christmas or not... just give thought to the fact that he's still with you and they caught this thing by accident. If not it's quite possible that he never would've been diagnosed before it got too big. Once they get to big they can't. All surgery is with risk.. but an aortic aneurysm is routine if it's under 5cm in size. Unfortunate for my Mother they let it get too big before they decided to do something for her. Ended up she had two.. both over 5 and in the end one was 10 cm before it burst in August."
416051,Roy,2009-12-28 18:07:00,13728,"Sorry to hear that Mike. If you want to talk, you know where I live and you have my phone number. Take care of yourself, for the others."

416217,ketchenany,2009-12-29 01:22:00,3229,Hopefully everything works out well. Family dinners can be had at any time of year. I have one with my children every Sunday.

416298,ChrisK,2009-12-29 04:20:00,2772,"I feel your pain Mike. Been going through the same thing here since June. Dad in the hospital with a bad liver and pretty much taking mom there everyday,sometimes twice... its exausting..Just recently he's been stable enough to go to a special needs nursing home were we are pretty sure he will spend the rest of his days. We did manage to steal him for a few hours on Christmas day though and take him to my sisters for dinner. Hope your dad recovers well from his ordeal and returns home soon... Our thoughts and prayers are with you....."

416359,tbayboy,2009-12-29 13:25:00,1497,Sorry to hear that Mike.  Never fun to have family in the hospital and being the holiday sure doesn't help   Keep up a good attitude though and you'll be out on the water soon and this will just be a bad memory.
416373,Ron,2009-12-29 14:08:00,1683,"Never a good feeling to hear this. Especially this time of year. It seems as though everyone's family is at it's closest this time of year. Our family is thinking of you and your parents throughout the festive season. Hope all goes well.  Cheers, Ron..."

416546,Greencoachdog,2009-12-29 23:16:00,8163," Very sorry to hear that Mike, hope both of your parents get well real soon!  I don't know about an aortic anuerism, but my 80 yo pops has has cerebral anuerism surgery and came through it like a champ... then he had triple bypass open heart surgery and can now smoke more cigarettes than me in an hour!  Modern medicine is a wonderful thing, I'm sure everything will work out fine!"
