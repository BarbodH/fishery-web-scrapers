418453,Jeff_C,2010-01-04 05:58:00,50,"We hit the ice under the cover of dark and got setup quickly. Fishn hunter (Ian) knocked a homerun out right off the bat! 10lbs 11 oz, minutes later ... 2 for 2 with a 6+ lbr! Fish started hitting the ice all around the group with most being in the 4- 8 range. The biggest of the morning came off of the rod of Fishn Hunter - a beauty 11 lb 13 oz.  In the morning, we landed 14 fish! Everyone was having a ton of fun.  For the afternoon, we were down to just myself and Ashley.  We put another 6 on the ice between the two of us.  Two anglers today caught their first ever walleyes through the ice.  Ashley ended up with 5 walleye and her last one of the day was 10lbs!  Chef Tim treated us to a great fish fry from a couple of the day's smaller fish.  It was a great day with lots of memories to take home.  Jeff         "
