The factory seats are beautiful to behold but after a few hours in them- they suck. Maybe the foam has just worn out, but i have found Lund seats etc to be far superior. I really need a seat with some support for my butt- I usually use an orthotic seat cushion while trolling. Should I be looking at newer Starcraft seats from a dealer, or can Bass Pro hook me up?"

I bought these Lowe OEM seats for about $75 USD each from Ebay.  Not a bad deal and they are super comfy.  I've tried the seats from BassPro but after 2 years, they tend to soften up as well.      In the boat...  "
