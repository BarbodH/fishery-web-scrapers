418657,Radnine,2010-01-04 23:11:00,1538,"Sorry Gerritt, is it restoration work that you do mainly? Jim"
418658,Gerritt,2010-01-04 23:15:00,6129,Some not all.. This project is mostly all new construction on the existing foundation. the interior was completely gutted by fire.. as was the roof.. only thing left standing were the outside rock walls. the interior shots I am showing are all pretty much new lumber. With the fir coming from Quebec.  G
418659,Leecher,2010-01-04 23:16:00,7832,You seemed puzzled or is this a sign of relief??   Nice work Gerritt Leechman
418660,Gerritt,2010-01-04 23:18:00,6129,  LOL I am freezing! damn cold in there... and no heaters allowed.
418662,Leecher,2010-01-04 23:22:00,7832, I hear ya G
418670,pike slayer,2010-01-04 23:42:00,1177,thats some fine work! you need a nice impact driver for those bolts though! and i love paslode guns to! what did we do without them??
418673,Twocoda,2010-01-04 23:50:00,4130,need a joist hanger for the one crashing into the beam
418674,Gerritt,2010-01-04 23:54:00,6129," LOL! that is what I was doing... the Gusset Clips were not spec'd by the engineer until after the floor was installed... everything needs to be boxed and hung on hangers now... after installing the gusset clips, fun fun!"
418678,Whitespinnerbait,2010-01-05 00:09:00,2038,Fine workmanship right there..............
418692,Gerritt,2010-01-05 00:42:00,6129,Pictures of the fire... and the story are here...  http://www.markpreecehouse.ca/  G.
418740,Sinker,2010-01-05 02:38:00,8692,Nice work Gerrit. Love those big beams!  Have fun with those hangers  S.
418746,Twocoda,2010-01-05 02:41:00,4130, we had one arm like Popeye  personnally i rather use my bostitch but i do own two paslodes that rotate in for repairs
418755,mbac31,2010-01-05 03:13:00,904,Sac religious that you use those fine hand forged Japanese chisels on that stuff.   You need a nice mortise attachment for that drill. Nice work Curious as to why they didnt use LVL's there with caps or are these getting finished after?
418766,Hooked,2010-01-05 03:56:00,891,"Pretty ironic, I work for Hamilton Health Sciences, so I guess it's your truck blocking me from using that one entrance to the hospital parking lot. Next time I'll have to stop by and say hey, move that truck, haha, jk. You guys got alot of work ahead of ya's for sure, but looking solid so far."
418768,Gerritt,2010-01-05 04:04:00,6129,"  I was wondering if anyone would notice the chisels  I put them there on purpose (they were not used) to see if anyone would notice as I had them in my box beside me. Nice catch.. They are very far from cheap, but one of the best chisels I have ever owned, I am a firm believer that good hand tools will last for life... where electrics are disposable.  As for LVL's, paralams etc....  they were not spec'd .. need to remember... this is an old space... and before the fire, solid fir was used 12x18... not to mention, LVL's would weigh/cost alot more given the same dimensions, and big and bulky is what they are looking for... very rustic... and all exposed... and the fir at the end of the day cost less...averaging about 15.00 lnf, based on volume.  not to mention the cost savings in adding a veneer (labour)  Good eye on tools.... I should show off my hand planes  I have an apron plane you would give you're left to use lol  G"
418769,Gerritt,2010-01-05 04:09:00,6129,"  Thanks man!... yeah one of those trucks is mine! Look for the Ford E350 with the huge bubble on it! (Unicell body) I work several different sites at any given time, but if you see the truck by all means ask for me! I will be there,  and coffee is close by... as is adult entertainment!  LOL  G."
418770,Dara,2010-01-05 04:11:00,3052,I love the big timbers. I do steel for work myself. the wood is a hobby. I agree with the chisel remark though...a sad way to keep your fine japanese chisels. I have one like them. Actually I don't like the steel ring pressing into my palm.  just one question though...do you guys not need to wear hard hats on construction sites down there?  edited to say I was typing this as you made your chisel reply 2 posts above  Lets see the apron plane
418781,workwear,2010-01-05 04:50:00,592,"a nice change working with post and beams in these rustic projects..........better than working with 2x4""s  looks great......and ya dont even need to hire a painter...."
418792,rhare,2010-01-05 11:24:00,387,"Very cool Gerritt!  Looks like we have a few handy fellows on the site!   I am also a carpenter, do mostly finish work but a bit of everything. Here's a few pic's of the current project. Cape Cod style. 7 bathrooms, one in each beadroom and 3 common. I wish I could get some pics of the landscaping around the pool at the back of the house but too much snow! Its still a work in progress but should be finished up by the spring.     "

418849,Twocoda,2010-01-05 16:03:00,4130,beautiful work troutguy...  ....love the crown and frieze combonation......is the entire exterior shingled? ....talk about rustic.....its going to look amazing when it ages with the $$copper eaves trough and flashing$$
418858,Bernie,2010-01-05 17:10:00,3190,Hey Gerritt it's good to see you actually working. Now that I see your handiwork you may not get off so easy the next time.  If you are so inclined I'll be at the boat show this weekend hanging out at the Crestliner display. C'mon over and we will yak about some ice fishing soon.
