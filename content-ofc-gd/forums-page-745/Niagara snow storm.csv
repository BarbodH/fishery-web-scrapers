418483,muddler,2010-01-04 13:05:00,623,Here's the latest.  This is my favourite radar site.  http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/radar/index_e.html?id=WSO  muddler
418204,bigfish1965,2010-01-03 16:51:00,3382,"A very localized area of lake effect snow is hitting the St Catharines corridor on the QEW and is going to get worse...up to 30 cm of snow with whiteouts. I know thats not much for you northern or snow belt guys, but we don't usually get that much and don't really have the equipment to handle it. Be careful on the highways!"
418209,Fisherman,2010-01-03 16:58:00,7201,"Localized eh,    well it's just a blasting away up here around Barrie too,  pretty wicked whiteouts and drifting,  drive down the roads and come back 15 minutes later,  no evidence of previous tracks."
418215,bigfish1965,2010-01-03 17:05:00,3382,Pfftt..you Barrie guys get this crap all the time. This will shut the city down here.
418218,HTHM,2010-01-03 17:09:00,4082,"Memories of '77, eh? That was one heck of a storm too! Stay safe and warm if you can."
418223,solopaddler,2010-01-03 17:16:00,8605,"Nothing in Grimsby yet, hopefully the squalls don't materialize."

I would have liked to get out and try some more fishing but not in these conditions.  Hope those that are affected by the storms are safe and sound!
418264,phiphntek,2010-01-03 19:32:00,115,you could drill a hole through the ice at midfield in Ralph Wilson Stadium right now.I think the Colts have gone fishin.

418446,bigfish1965,2010-01-04 04:36:00,3382, Well..my vehicle doesn't say John Deere on the side of it. Snow day was good...even though the highway was closed for awhile cause they couldn't get a handle on the black ice. Just a few dozen minor accidents luckily. Still snowing though...
418459,wormdunker,2010-01-04 07:32:00,1711,"I'm in Fonthill, snowed all last night - right now probably 10"" on the ground.  I hope the snow blower is working!!   ""work is for those who don't know how to fish"""
