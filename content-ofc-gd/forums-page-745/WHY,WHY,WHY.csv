418208,Fisherman,2010-01-03 16:55:00,7201," Just for safety sake, how about not giving people the wrong idea, some are swayed just to easily, want to rub yourself out, I don't have a problem with that, just don't encourage others."
418211,fishboy,2010-01-03 17:01:00,550,Darwin will get 'em eventually...
418236,POLLIWOGG,2010-01-03 18:03:00,835,"A truck was on the Ice and did not fall through, its sad what passes for news these days. Apparently he was presented to the public so that the uninformed masses could pass judgment. The lack of facts like ice thickness only shows that the intention was to sensationalize.  Dara ....the stunt driving law has been ruled unconstitutional twice, so it would be no more or less unconstitutional for the cops to illegally take someones truck from the ice as it is to take it from the 401.  As far as spinning their truck on the ice, if you grew up rural you've been there done that."
418260,JohnF,2010-01-03 19:20:00,3494,"Back in the late 60's we were ice racing cars at Young's Point (I think, it was a long time ago) and some guys were running down the lake and throwing their cars into a spin at high speed. I suspect it was locals because all the ice racers were busy with heats. I'm sure it was fun, at least fun until the guy with what was reported later to be a new hemi Charger put on a great show, ending up in the open water at the narrows south of our location. I guess he didn't realize how fast he was going. The car sank but he got out. We heard they brought in a big helicopter from Borden to lift it out. Must have been a pretty expensive donut.  JF"
418326,ciceri,2010-01-03 23:16:00,535," When did they say there was open water meters away? How long has that bay been frozen for now, close to a month?  Its the beginning of the ice season, what do ya expect?"
418360,musky66,2010-01-04 00:11:00,273,"Wow, I thought hemi Chargers could do everything- even float. Love the old Chargers- have a '66 of my own ( no Hemi though...)"
418380,JohnF,2010-01-04 01:08:00,3494, We could feel the ice shaking when it was building up speed. We all commented on it before it came into sight from behind the point. I don't remember other cars doing that.  My bro-in-law had a 440 R/T Magnum. It was pretty fast and the gas mileage sucked around town.  JF  JF
418399,Dara,2010-01-04 01:41:00,3052,"  So...we have to stop having fun because stupid people might copy us and get it wrong?   PS, when you don't grow up rutal..iced over mall parking lots are where you do the donuts...just watch the darn light poles and dry spots DAMHIKT"
418406,misfish,2010-01-04 01:55:00,29133,  WHY DONT YA ALL ASK THE GUY THAT KEEPS THE ICE ROAD CLEAR TO THE ISLAND??????????????   http://www.yorkregion.com/article/101301  For all those that know all.   Go ahead and drive off all.  Sry for the families loss.
417989,misfish,2010-01-02 23:48:00,29133,"   WHY,do these guys pull bonehead moves. If anyone watched the Achannel tonight,you all seen that  and his truck doing donuts out on Cooks Bay today.Full size GM.  Just plain stupid."
417992,Twocoda,2010-01-02 23:53:00,4130,not that anybody deserves a life long lesson ...but some people just make themselves more vulnerable to them
417993,lookinforwalleye,2010-01-02 23:53:00,4399,"Does not surprise me in the least, there is a large proportion of the ice fishing crowd that have proven time and again that they are not the sharpest knives in the drawer.  Most OFC Community excluded of course!!!"
417995,lew,2010-01-02 23:59:00,12766,CFTO also had video of someone doin donuts Brian.....crazy stuff fer sure.  Boyz being boyz I spose
417996,Terry,2010-01-03 00:06:00,14456,"well no one said the guys in the truck were ice fishermen   but that being said so what did the guy do other then playing a bit with his truck, if there was enough ice to support it and I didn't here about it going through.......  I saw nothing wrong with a guy doing that , it would be a different story if he was waiving ariund people and huts, but he seemed to be away from everyone"
417999,misfish,2010-01-03 00:11:00,29133," Terry  OPEN water just meters out.Come on.You know better then that.  If he had of gone through,you would be singing a different tune.So ya he was lucky.   Dont tell me theres 12 inches out there either.   Oh,can I take yer truck out???????LOL"
418012,irishfield,2010-01-03 00:37:00,26272,I'd have drove Terry's truck out onto the lake we were on yesterday !
418013,Terry,2010-01-03 00:37:00,14456,"if the ice was too thin then stupid boy  but maybe he walked around for half an hour checking the ice conditions before he drove on  my problem is with the news always making things sound worst then what it is........  and once I check the ice conditions and if I feel they are safe, sure you can take if for a spin.... they have been driving trucks over to the island for days now, the same day they quit with the ferry the ice road was on"
418020,misfish,2010-01-03 00:51:00,29133,"  Wayne,anyone would drive a dodge on the ice.LOL   With the high winds today,and not the best ice yet,I would deffer not to drive out.  Just looking for trouble. WAY TO EARLY FOR THAT."
418022,Fisherman,2010-01-03 00:55:00,7201,"Friday there was  someone ripping up and down the west side of cooks on a sled, damm near impossible to see where the ice had cracked and heaved, then they wonder why they go airborn or run into a hut like the one did last year.  Speed doesn't kill, it's the rudely abrupt cessation of forward motion that does it.   Some take safety advice and heed, some others, they make the news."
418024,Whitespinnerbait,2010-01-03 01:02:00,2038,12 '' of ice ???    thats 4'' more than enough for a truck pulling donuts...
418041,vinnimon,2010-01-03 02:16:00,2593,"Last time I was out on simcoe and the last since Ive seen a lot of stupid things going on.In that no ontario plates involved.90% MICHIGAN,10%PENN and NEW YORK.I guess what Im saying is if there are no signs then go for it.What ever it is.I saw some of the dummist thing out there esp by one from michigan.He wanted to stay warm and find some safe ice to park on.He was doing donuts and figure 8s.When he was comfortable he and his buddy drilled holes around the car,left it running and opened the hood.Their excuse was they wanted to hit all angles and stay warm on safe ice.We rolled out a 50 ft rope to them and pinned it to the ice and left.Just a bad memory from being there thats all."
418047,Twocoda,2010-01-03 02:44:00,4130," Vinni...ive never seen a ""NO JUMPING OFF"" sign on any bridges i have ever crossed...but sometimes ...common sense should prevail"
418052,musky66,2010-01-03 02:58:00,273,Right after the guy in the truck doing donuts they showed my son on his yellow Mach Z- it was pretty cool to see. I have spoken to him several times about safety and he is pretty cautious. He has witnessed two deaths and a serious accident in the last two seasons(including last night) so I hope he has gotten the message. NO way would I be driving a full size truck on any ice down here right now- no way!
418056,POLLIWOGG,2010-01-03 03:13:00,835,"Probably get charged with stunt driving, loss of license and truck impounded."
418057,vinnimon,2010-01-03 03:14:00,2593,
418077,Dara,2010-01-03 04:14:00,3052,"  For what? He is on the ice. You can drive a sled as fast as you want out there, why would a truck be any different?  If he goes through there are charges for pollution. Till then, I know of nothing that can be done"
418085,T Fisher,2010-01-03 04:32:00,139,"Maybe it's the Canadian beer, thats it blame the beer our friends from the south are use to drinking BUD LIGHT."
418101,SlowPoke,2010-01-03 05:10:00,2984," It never used to be this bad. In the old days, Boxing Day sales were on Boxing Day. Now you have the Pre Boxing Day sale; Boxing Week sale, Boxing Week sale ""Held Over"".  Where is a guy going to find a decent parking lot to whack a few 'nuts?  I say he was acting very responsibly by not taking it to the streets."

418131,musky66,2010-01-03 12:01:00,273,"Actually, the truck driver was a local."
418135,Greencoachdog,2010-01-03 12:43:00,8163,"  That's because you've never been down here! We have ""No Diving From Bridge"" signs a lot of bridges down here... and they still do it and sometimes kill or paralyze themselves."
418140,Twocoda,2010-01-03 13:28:00,4130, you have never invited me
418149,Greencoachdog,2010-01-03 13:56:00,8163,"  Come on down!... the waters fine! It's a nice and balmy 45*F, you might even wanna take a swim eh?!!!"
418193,ch312,2010-01-03 16:13:00,1590,"news reporters must have had a pretty slow day if they were concerned about a truck blowing donuts on the ice. its a ton of fun getting up to speed and then cranking it over to see how many times you can spin. plain old donuts are too boring for me  he likely checked the ice, didnt fall through, and nobody was hurt. i dont see the problem?  there is no set required thickness to hold a truck and 12"" is just the general number people follow because there is no way for the average joe to determine how strong the ice is on each water body at different times of the year."
