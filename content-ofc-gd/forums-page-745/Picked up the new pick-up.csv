418562,blaque,2010-01-04 18:16:00,2419,"Ive had two F-150 XLT Supercrews in a row and have loved them both.  Im due for another this June and have eyed up this exact same vehicle Lew. You will love this truck  Im afraid of the payment im going to end up with this time however as my buddy just shopped pick-ups and told me im going to fall on the floor when i hear what my payments are going to land on this time around to stay in the same truck.  Any insite on that Lew. What did you find while shopping, i dont want your monthly payment lol..........ok maybe i do LOL"
418615,lew,2010-01-04 21:12:00,12766,"  Definetely good meeting up with you Ian...........small world eh ??  Congrats on that Raptor and as you say, it's a beast fer sure and looks like it belongs in one of those Baja multi-day desert races  Best of luck with the new ride Ian and hopefully it'll be everything your lookin for, but from the things I've read about, I'm sure it will be.     Thanks Blaque, it's good to hear your positive comments  about the 150.  Sorry I can't help you with the info on the monthly payments as I didn't finance mine, but they've had some fantastic incentive packages lately that were hard to pass up, but if I'm not mistaken, some of the deals were ending as of today.  Don't know what deals will be availabe next June but hopefully you find something good."

417297,mikemcmillan,2009-12-31 22:48:00,50,"Beauty ride, hope it takes you to all the right fishing spots. Question about the spray in liner, could you spray this on the inside of the fenders, they would never rust and last for ever. just a thought. wonder if anyone has tryed this?  KW Mike"
417309,JohnAB,2009-12-31 22:59:00,178,Nice truck and been hearing lots of good things in regards to fuel mileage with them. Congrats.
417315,Beans,2009-12-31 23:10:00,3339,She's a beauty Lew...  I think I'm driving it's great-grandfather...1995 F-150...Enforcer !!!
417332,Wendel,2009-12-31 23:51:00,213,"Nice truck Lew, I have the 09 with the 4.6, Love it and everything about it. So much room on the inside... It's my second Super Crew, had an 05 as well, it was a pig on gass, the 09 is a miser... when pulling the boat I get twice the mileage...  Mark"
417348,TEP,2010-01-01 00:26:00,68,Nice ride Lew. She'll look awesome sitting on a frozen lake when you take me out to your favourite ice fishing spot! LOL!!
417376,cram,2010-01-01 01:11:00,1733,"That's a beautiful machine, Lew.  Great choice.  Love the colour too."
417516,lunkerbasshunter,2010-01-01 12:00:00,2585,wow great ride!  Congrats on the purchase  Cheers!
417517,Spiel,2010-01-01 12:07:00,9065,"  That's just what I was thinking. 2009, the year of Lew......  Congrats Lew, nice looking ride and as previously mentioned it'll look great pulling that new boat!"
417522,pikehunter,2010-01-01 13:19:00,1659,"She's a beauty Lew,    good on buying N/A but too bad the F150's are no longer made in Oakville, but that doesn't matter.  Does driving a red truck bring back any memories? But then it doesn't have a flashing red light up on the roof does it?  Yes 2009 should be renamed the year of Lew   Didn't ya all know? Lew won the 649   and forgot to tell us all   Selling your house in a T.O burb is much the same thing as hitting the lottery, you get a very good buck for what you have and the funds can be stretched a long way when moving to a different locale.  Congrats Lew, all the best in 2010 and enjoy the new ride and new pad."
417530,Bernie,2010-01-01 14:07:00,3190,"Very nice ride Lew. Several of my regular customers have well over 300,000 k on the 5.4 without any major issues. Never had one of those engines apart, none of my customers has had an engine issue. Having regular maintainance done goes a long way towards the longevity.  They had ignition coil and spark plug problems in the past but they have improved those issues in the new models. One thing I would recommend is to keep the lever in the backing plate for the emergency brake lubricated. They have a tendency to seize if not used regularly. Also have the brake caliper slides and pins serviced once a year. It helps to keep the brakes working efficient and smooth to avoid warping the rotors. Oil the door/hood/tailgate hinges, locks and latches to prevent door pin wear and latches from from sticking.  The above advise is applicable to other vehicles as well."
417534,Tybo,2010-01-01 14:24:00,1373,"Nice truck Lew. To bad I'm not a Ford Guy. They are the Nice's looking truck on the Market.  Bernie, Funny you mentioned about keeping every thing lube. Did my truck last night.If it moves, It must be lubed. Need to get a new can of jig a lube."
417679,lew,2010-01-01 21:03:00,12766,"Howdy folks  We headed to my buds place north of Peterboro yesterday morning for New Years Eve  just after I posted this thread and just got home an hour ago.  I put about 200 miles on the truck and hafta say, it's by far the most comfortable & smoothest riding truck I've ever driven...really really nice !! I purposely went onto some rough snow covered back roads just to tryout the 4x4 and it worked extremely well.  And Bernie, thanks for the tips, I'm extemely fussy about all my  gear and always keep it maintained in accordance with manufacturers recommendations....and then some.  Anyways, thanks to all for the positive feedback and I think I'm gonna enjoy this truck for a long time."
417682,Mattones,2010-01-01 21:14:00,587,"Normally I would say, boo. But I love the 09 Fords  If I didnt buy the new Ram i would have bought the F150 they are nice trucks!! COngrads on a great truck!"
417698,tibbs,2010-01-01 22:17:00,650,Congrats on the new Truck!
417775,Bernie,2010-01-02 01:47:00,3190, Anytime Lew. If the time ever comes and you need a little help with anything give me a holler.
417915,Billy Bob,2010-01-02 18:09:00,5865,Nice move on a upgraded truck with the Ford......next you will be upgrading to a Toyota TUNDRA...
417919,Cudz,2010-01-02 18:33:00,2652,"Nice truck.  I wasn't sold on the new look of the 150 but it is slowly growing on me.  With regards to the spray in liner.  I have been to Ft. McMurray a few times and the guys up there will often spray truck on the outside with the liner as well.  It looks like a two tone paint job and thy will often spray halfway up the doors.  I saw 2 brand new trucks up there that were completely sprayed with liner.  They have lots of rocks, gravel etc up there and you do have to remember that most of the workers are from Newfoundland.  Lol.  Sorry to all the East coast boys on this forum which I know there are a loads."
417972,Squid,2010-01-02 22:32:00,1656,Sweet ride!!! color goes well with the boat!!!

418143,Rich Clemens,2010-01-03 13:40:00,3131,"  Pete - I'm glad to see someone thinks the color of the boat should match up with the vehicle pulling it.  Now that I have a blue F-150, it just does not match my boat.  I've been trying to convince Patsy of that all year and I'm just not making any progress.  Since I have as blue cover for the boat, she say's it does match the truck.    Any chance you could help out here ?"
418150,lew,2010-01-03 13:57:00,12766,"That was the exact reasoning I used Rich, I told Diane that the burghundy / white  Skeeter just didn't look right behind the beige truck and I'd have to change it or look foolish goin down the hiway"
418177,aplumma,2010-01-03 15:41:00,6896,Nice Truck Lew I like the color it is right on for a fireman.   Art
417127,lew,2009-12-31 14:28:00,12766,"I purchased a new 2010 F-150 and picked it up from the dealership last night.  I went with the 5.4 litre, 310 HP so it'll be good for towing the new boat and the 4x4 with 18"" wheels will come in handy when I move north to snow country in February. It's got a folding, hard tonneau and I had the spray in bed liner applied too.  Also got the rear mounted camera to make backing up to the trailer tongue a bit easier.  I'm heading north of Peterboro this morning so it'll be good to get the feel of it on the hiway.  "

417144,Ron,2009-12-31 14:58:00,1683,"Nice truck Lew! That 5.4 will give you pulling power like you wouldn't expect. I had the 4.6 in mine, brother had 5.4 in his. I got better fuel economy but not by much.  I put 350,00 on mime, sold it and now have a Toyota Tundra. Brother did the same. His 02 ford with the 5.4, motor went out of it with 290,000."

417163,Muskieman,2009-12-31 15:37:00,2472,"  While I was selling parts and wheels and tires... The BIG complaint with ALL Manufacturers is that there aren't too many choices for tires in the 18"" 20"" 22"" that are affordable.  When I left ,I had converted at least 20 customers to a 17"" Wheel and Tire combo.... Way cheaper and a TON of choices.    By the way...BEAUTIFUL TRUCK LEW!!!!!  Congrats...  RFS "
