Brother-in-law caught two perch on minnows and jig head. As we didn't have a hut, I decided once I couldn't feel my extremities that it was time to go in. Lots of huts out all over the lake."

I was out in Muskoka on NYE and early NYD while it was still only -7.  Mind you...I didn't do much better than a couple perch   So there goes my ""musta been the weather"" excuse!"
