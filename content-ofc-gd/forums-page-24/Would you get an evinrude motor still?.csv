1068118,Bernie,2020-12-04 20:41:00,3190,"I was honestly sad to see the demise of the Evinrudes. I grew up with OMC products of all kinds; Lawn Boys, Pioneer chain saws, Johnson/Evinrude outboards/snow machines and several other things they made. I fondly remember trips to the plant in Peterborough picking up loads of stuff for dad. They had some incredibly talented engineers and quality people putting product through the assembly line.  	My 2000 175 Ficht has been a great engine and continues to run after 19 seasons as well as it did when I first hooked it up.  Would I get another? Yes, I probably would."
1067643,Tjames09,2020-11-21 19:47:00,664,With them stopping making motors would you still consider one on a used boat?
1067644,John Bacon,2020-11-21 20:23:00,3277,"I wouldn't exclude it outright.  But, I would pay less for an Evinrude than other motors.  	If it's a current model, I would also wonder how long marine grade two stroke motor oil will be available.  I don't think anyone is selling two stroke motors in North America anymore.  I am sure oil will be available for the 15-20 years.  After that, finding it may start to become difficult. "
1067660,Bill,2020-11-22 12:07:00,140,I was going to upgrade from my old 60 Evinrude to a 90 E-Tec. I think I will be buying a 90 Mercury now. 
1067665,Rustic-Fisher,2020-11-22 14:01:00,826,"Listed my Lund  at the start of summer , powered by a 90 ETEC. A TON of guys were after the two stroke because they had been discontinued . Boat sold within 2 hours , unfortunately so did its replacement ."
1067666,dave524,2020-11-22 14:06:00,4508,"I recall when OMC stopped making I/O's on the used market they referred to a white outdrive on a used boat as the "" white leg of death "" Weren't some of the smaller JohnnyRudes in later years actually Suzukis ?much like smaller Merc's are Tohatsu's"
1067667,Sinker,2020-11-22 14:25:00,8692,"Nope! I am a pretty dedicated Yamaha guy though, so I am biased."
1067671,Chris J,2020-11-22 16:00:00,44,Never.
1067690,Yellow Fever,2020-11-23 11:59:00,139,"I just did, bought a 2020 Ranger 621 and it has the 300 G2. I like the 2 strkes and have a very good mechanic if i need him. They have to have parts, they just can't leave all the owners hanging...i would assume that would be a huge lawsuit."
1067691,lew,2020-11-23 12:13:00,12766,"Congratulations, that's a gorgeous rig !!"
1067698,Terry,2020-11-23 15:04:00,14456,If the price is right.  Yup. I would buy one
1067701,mamona,2020-11-23 15:11:00,597,^^ what just Terry said. Getting a nice rig for a good price. Especially these days.
1067742,AKRISONER,2020-11-24 03:48:00,5558,I wouldn’t buy an evinrude even before they went out of business...there’s a reason they did
1067755,porkpie,2020-11-24 16:06:00,2521,"I wouldn’t buy a new model evinrude myself.  That said the last 2 stroke Yamaha I sold, I had guys fighting over it on kijiji and offering more than I asked to beat out others.  I ended up selling it to the first guy that offered my asking price and he EMT’d me a $500 deposit on the basis of the YouTube video I made of it running, sight unseen other than the pics, so I’d hold it for him until he could pick up that weekend.  So there’s definitely a good market for 2 strokes!"
1067777,John Bacon,2020-11-25 05:52:00,3277,I think that all four stroke Johnsons were made by Suzuki.  I don't think the OMC/Bombardier/BRP every made a four stroke outboard of their own.  	The smaller Evinrudes were made by Tohatsu.  They never made a small sized E-tec.
1067779,Garnet,2020-11-25 10:48:00,2056,I'm a Merc guy.
1067780,DanD,2020-11-25 13:32:00,2223,"With Bombardier owning Evinrude, there won't be replacement parts issues for many years. Just like the automotive ""manufacturers"", they don't actually manufacture the parts that go into their vehicles. They buy them built to their spec. I can't see Bombardier/Evinrude being any different. Then there will be the aftermarket industry, that will pick up on a lot of the top moving parts and have them cloned or find a  different replacement part that will fit and function. Dan."
1067781,Chris J,2020-11-25 13:44:00,44,X2
1067786,sauce,2020-11-25 14:58:00,219,"I have a 40 E-tec. Over 300 hours on it now. So my warranty is over. No problems so far.  I'm happy with my 2 stroke.  If I was in the market to upgrade my current rig I would definitely consider E-tec/ G2 for power. But I would be buying used. I wouldn't feel good about the warranty on a brand new motor being honored on a discontinued brand. It's a shame that no manufacturer has stepped in and bought the brand.  A lot of people really like their 2 stroke outboards.  It's a tough choice to decide which 4 stroke is best. Yamaha Mercury Suzuki are all great 4 strokes. As far as 2 stroke oil goes, Evinrude has 3 grades available. XD30 XD50 and XD100.  XD100 is recommended and also the most expensive.  XD100 is NMMA certified TC-W3 oil...  If you do a little research, you will find that there are other brands that make equivalent TC-W3 oil.  Obviously you would void the Evinrude warranty.  But IF the supply runs out, there are options."
1067789,John Bacon,2020-11-25 15:50:00,3277,"To be clear, BRP is a completely different and independant company from Bombardier who make trains and planes.  Even though the B in BRP stands for Bombardier, it's still a separate and independant company.  	Having said that.  BRP will probably still have parts available for more than 10 years.  But 20 or 30 years from now remains to be seen."
1067858,Hack_Fisherman,2020-11-26 22:57:00,720,Not unless 50% of msrp or better. The price would have to be very attractive a) they are still not a 4 stroke b) no assurances of factory support or replacement part supply. I tend to keep my purchases until they are used up c) I had a die hard looper racer tell me they blow up and bottom ends are weak (that might be for racing however)
1067897,Tjames09,2020-11-27 21:48:00,664,"Well the boat with the evinrude on it I wanted to see was seriously manhandled and I wouldnt have bought it anyways. Drove pretty far to see it too. Sometimes pictures online can be really misleading. Boat was trashed in person, disappointing."
1067995,410001661,2020-12-01 15:53:00,127,I just did.......bought a 2017 Starcraft with a 90Hp Etec
1068066,msp,2020-12-03 18:22:00,1336,"Used to have an evinrude 115 fict injection. Never had so many issues with a motor. Made the switch to Yamaha and never looked back. So , no"
1068106,Garnet,2020-12-04 16:15:00,2056,Those Fich are great example. 1st year a giant binder of up dates like 300 you couldn't keep them out of the shop. When all the crap was sorted out fabulous motors guys ran great.
1068114,BillM,2020-12-04 20:11:00,17367,That sucks man.  How bad was it?
