Thank you for your e-mail regarding the use of Snow Dogs in Ontario.            "
1039123,dave524,2019-01-11 23:32:00,4508,Looks like they reinvented the Bolens Snowmobile of the sixties. LOL ?
1039124,Terry,2019-01-11 23:40:00,14456,Yeah the husky was another one years ago they are interesting for long walks on the ice

1067553,Roboutdoors,2020-11-19 00:37:00,2,"Thanks for posting this response from Mto (fisherman) I recently got a snowdog and put a liability insurance policy on it. I'm only using the machine for pulling my ice gear out onto the lake and then back to my truck. I'm planning on keeping the mto reply  with my insurance, bill of sale. Would there be any chance you could send a copy of the full reply with the mto email signature? If not could you tell me who I should email at mto? Thanks again for posting.  Rob"
