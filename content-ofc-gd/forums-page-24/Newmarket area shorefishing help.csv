1067289,Fishingyourlures,2020-11-11 02:19:00,1,Hey fellow Ontario fishermen and womenðŸ˜€Â I am a resident of Newmarket and I am having a very hard time finding any good fishing spots near me. I have been to the canals around highway 9 and went to the Humber river near the Rogers conservation area but I had no luck after manyÂ multiple attempts. So I come before you knowledgeable fishermen and ask for any tips or hotspots on catching some good fish near Newmarket. Any spots within a 30 minute drive from upper Canada mall is mostly what I need. Any help at all is greatly appreciated. Thankyou and keep those lines tight ðŸ¤©
