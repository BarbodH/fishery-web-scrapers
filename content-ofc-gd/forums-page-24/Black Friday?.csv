1068015,AKRISONER,2020-12-02 03:05:00,5558,Exactly. This stuff always happens as the next gen is about to be released. As far as Iâ€™m concerned If you can stay 100% up to date with the latest and greatest when it comes to electronics in the fishing industry than youâ€™ve got some seriously deep pockets. livescope is the top of the chain in marine electronics and that unit is equipped for it. Thatâ€™s good enough for me!
1068034,Headhunter,2020-12-02 19:05:00,5703,"No fishing directly, but still on topic if you bare with me.... Years ago I worked at a music store, teaching and selling. We had a trade show (NAMM) to attend and we ended up sitting next to the president of Roland Music. the dude was a technology genius. While chatting, our keyboard teacher ask Mr. Roland about some tech in one of their current at the time keyboards. Mr. Roland grabbed a napkin and wrote out the technical design right then and there. We thought he was brilliant... until he told us that back home, they had warehouses full of new technology they had developed and were going to put out to the market, but not until they had made enough profit on the existing product line! I have to believe that all tech companies work this way in order to meet demands of their shareholders. HH"
1068035,Snidley,2020-12-02 19:34:00,620,"In fising that is for sure the case. Even stalwarts like shimano offer deep discounts through preferred retailersÂ Â when they're changing over to new models. it would not surprise me that they also use remaining old ""new"" stock in their own supply chain to lower the price of store shelf inventory in the retailers. This way they blow the old stock out with tail end wholesale inventory at their manufacturing cost lowering the wholesale cost to preferred retailers so they sell off the old gear but still profit from the transaction. It's a win win situation that I used myself when I worked for Planters Peanuts. We would drive around usingÂ Â a carload of inventory that allowed us to credit retailers for in store sales, damaged goods and priority shelf space and Instead of actual money from credit notes we distributed dry roast peanuts at our cost price. The whole effort made my 1978 Plymouth Fury drag it's tail down the road however."
1068044,LeXXington,2020-12-03 00:45:00,1928,Did he work for Blackberry just prior to the iPhone release ðŸ˜œ
1068053,Headhunter,2020-12-03 13:01:00,5703,"Blackberry just signed an agreement with Amazon, check the stock price! HH"
1068061,LeXXington,2020-12-03 15:40:00,1928,That's for the software they developed outside of the cell phones.Â  Blackberry made the mistake of delaying the arrival of new cell phones once the iphone came out.. They tried to play catch up after the fact but every time they came out with a new model it was already obsolete by the competition. When people made the switch it was hard to get them back. Once the realized the could never catch up they focused on the software and got out of the cell phone business altogether.Â  The patents on the software saved the company. 
1067831,206,2020-11-26 14:58:00,563,Anyone see or care to share any good deals online or local for fishing gear... boats away and no ice I'm feeling all cooped up and looking to spend on fishing stuff lol
1067865,GBW,2020-11-26 23:51:00,8460,"Mark I got an email today from Sail abour a sale that might be good.Â  Then again, they have limited stock... Otherwise, it might be an online sort of hunt the next for days for some hidden jem deals.Â  Not sure.Â  I am well stocked on the moment for fishing items/gear so I have been looking more for motorcycle items."
1067874,Snidley,2020-11-27 01:14:00,620,Sometimes Ganons in Oshawa has a good sale for Black Friday
1067891,LeXXington,2020-11-27 21:09:00,1928,"Since Sail has ""restructured"" I hate getting the daily e-mail about the great sale they are having.. only to find that is really only a $7898.00 coat on sale %60 off.. The black Friday e-mail was no different..Â  but worse.. most of the fishing stuff was in-store only or limited stock. No deals to be found online.. there are a bunch of local shops running great deals but in-store only"
1067909,Snidley,2020-11-28 00:49:00,620,They really do have some expensive stuff I used to get some truly exceptional deals on rods at the store in Mississauga. That must have been the store with unpublicized sales. Now that store is closed and the store in Burlington looks like it should be closed but just has no inventory
1067931,Dutch01,2020-11-29 02:03:00,1431,Might be more of a clearance deal than Black Friday but I went into my local Canadian Tire for a roll of hockey tape and came out with a new ice hut! Eskimo Quickfish 2i (insulated) I'm blown away by the quality for the price I paid ($269.99)     
1067938,misfish,2020-11-29 17:16:00,29133,"Dang, any left ? Go grab me one. LOL  Sweet buy bud.  Cabelas had the striker suit on 50% off Friday at 6 am. The hard water one. I got a discounted price on the one I bought a couple of weeks ago,as it was marked down. Ya,I got me a striker suit a couple weeks ago. Picked up the Striker Ice ."
1067943,Dutch01,2020-11-29 21:53:00,1431,"Last one at that store at least.Â Weird thing was I looked online beforeÂ I bought it andÂ it didn't show up in their online inventory. Striker at 50% is a steal too. I love mine,Â it's handsÂ down the best suitÂ I've owned."
1067952,porkpie,2020-11-30 05:11:00,2521,"You wonâ€™t regret it. Â Compared to my 25 year old buoy O buoy suit that was like wearing a suit of armour, the striker is amazing."
1067954,AKRISONER,2020-11-30 13:49:00,5558, sail had the 95sv on for $999 down from $1499 i couldnâ€™t find it cheaper at any other retailer. also rakuten had a 10% cash back bonus on items purchased online from sailÂ so I pulled the trigger on getting a Garmin force and got $400 back black friday ainâ€™t what it used to be but there were some great deals I saw you just had to dig hard.  the perfect jig also had some fantastic deals on tungsten. Rah fish was absolutely blowing out their inventory. They had touques for like $5 or something im sure these deals are still here for cyber Monday. Look to the manufacturers rather than the retailersÂ for deals on tackle. you wonâ€™t find great deals on non high end tackle because prices are set and the markup isnâ€™t as high.
1067956,Tjames09,2020-11-30 14:47:00,664,How do the garmins Â compare to hummingbird units?
1067960,AKRISONER,2020-11-30 15:02:00,5558,"I would argue that humminbirdâ€™s side and downÂ imaging with the mega + is definitely better. But I would also argue that Garmin with the touch screen and menus is a better system. navigation...Iâ€™ve been seeing some very troubling wonky stuff with humminbirds lately. Iâ€™m not sure whatâ€™s going on but the gps calibration seems off. Weird weird stuff. the real winner though is livescope. I havenâ€™t bought it yet but am now ready to. Once you see livescope...phh itâ€™s not even comparable. Humminbird just announced they are launching their own version in 2021 but thereâ€™s no way someoneâ€™s first version will run as well as another company thatâ€™s been doing it for years. finally, the main reason for the switch is Iâ€™m done with Johnson controls and their garbage trolling motors it was time for a switch and Iâ€™m putting my faith in someone else. Hopefully they donâ€™t let me down. The industry exclusive wireless linking between units and trolling motors is untouched in the industry still. Thatâ€™s absolutely massive.  "
1067961,Tjames09,2020-11-30 15:37:00,664,Interesting. I never had issues with my hummingbird or minnkota. Hummingbird makes it hard because they connect to the minnkota which if you donâ€™t want that feature you can go elsewhere; otherwise your stuck.
1067962,AKRISONER,2020-11-30 16:01:00,5558,"thats exactly why they do it. And exactly why garmin and Lowrance came out with their own trolling motors. They are expensive as hell, but they took all of the newest available tech and threw them into their units. Im excited to try the force out, apparently its incredible...i guess we will know this year. Brushless, wireless. I mean when you think about how humminbird refused to go with the wireless tech so that they can sell you networking cables, ok so you dont have to pay for that with garmin...but you pay more for the tech up front. Wireless linking in 2020 seems like a no brainer though at this point."
1067963,Terry,2020-11-30 16:26:00,14456,https://ca.binnacle.com/p15820/Garmin-echoMAP-UHD-95sv-with-Transducer-&-Canada-LakeVu-HD-Maps/product_info.html This was hard to resist Â the uhd side imaging 
1067965,AKRISONER,2020-11-30 16:35:00,5558,its $999 at sail and if you are with rakuten you get an additional 10% off! thats what I did!
1067966,AKRISONER,2020-11-30 16:36:00,5558,
1067974,David Chong,2020-11-30 20:53:00,836,That was a crazy good deal on the Striker Hardwater suit!
1067990,410001661,2020-12-01 15:19:00,127,I'm not not sure who has stock of anything anymore??Â  I bought my wife an Apple Watch and spent $500 but I saved a whopping $35.......oh wait it was a $35 gift card for the Apple Store so that will probably cost me another $200!!
1067999,Tjames09,2020-12-01 18:06:00,664,"Wow thanks, I now have a bill on my credit card hahaha. I cant pass on that."
1068000,wkrp,2020-12-01 19:57:00,656,Just makes me wonder what those are really worth when they can discount that much
1068001,Fisherman,2020-12-01 20:28:00,7201,"That goes for a lot of stuff they can sell on ""sales"" at 70-80% off and not loose any money."
1068006,Headhunter,2020-12-01 21:11:00,5703,CTC being a perfect example. HH
1068011,Fisherman,2020-12-01 22:42:00,7201,"Sears was another horrible one to do that, priced themselves out of business."
1068014,LeXXington,2020-12-02 01:33:00,1928,problem is no one likes to buy old electronics.. Sell it at a discount while you can.Â  Bigger the discount the less stock available. A new model is coming soon
