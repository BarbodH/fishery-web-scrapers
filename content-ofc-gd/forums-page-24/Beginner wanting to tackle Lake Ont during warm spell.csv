1067137,Raycaster,2020-11-03 23:19:00,528,"Just started fishing Lake Ontario mid summer and while still a beginner was hoping to hit Bronte area this weekend. Don’t mind getting SKUNKED (Im good at it), but is there still fishing action right now? I usually troll between 100-175 fow with the down-rigger and maybe a dipsey. Any help appreciated, thx. "
1067139,rockin-steelhead,2020-11-03 23:34:00,19,I would suggest maybe trying a bit deeper 200-250 if you are not marking fish where you typically like to fish. I would also try running one rod in and around 35-45 fow as the bows might be hanging in and around there.
1067140,dave524,2020-11-03 23:35:00,4508,I'd be trolling the south shore with planer boards and Balsa minnow baits in less than 30 feet of water for Browns
1067141,misfish,2020-11-03 23:57:00,29133,What I was going to say as well. Brass williams wobblers worked for me out in front of the humber back in the day.

1067146,BillM,2020-11-04 06:15:00,17367,I'd be fishing in close for browns/steelhead if it were me.
1067149,Raycaster,2020-11-04 13:13:00,528,Thanks for the help guys. Maybe trolling in tight with dipseys will be plan for the day.
1067151,BillM,2020-11-04 15:04:00,17367,"Inline planner boards if you've got them.   If not, go buy some they're cheap."
1067154,Snidley,2020-11-04 17:43:00,620,"Bill's got it. Planner boards in close for Bows by Bronte or 16 Mile. Surprisingly I did best with Chinooks in close at Bronte this year with plastic Shad Rap RS lures. Better than my usual Japanese lures and I was also using light line. This time of year bows like small baits in my experience. Light line as well, like 6lb maybe 8lb. if you are using expensive lures. The water will be cold so it will also be very clear and bows have really good eyesight. Browns even more so."
1067169,BillM,2020-11-05 01:38:00,17367,"Yup, long leads for sure.  I usually run 150ft+ when fishing bows off the boards in Owen Sound."
