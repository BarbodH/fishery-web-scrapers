1066692,tomkat,2020-10-20 15:35:00,246,I was thinking of getting a spot in a trailer park for next season. I was wondering if there are any parks that people are really happy with. I like Buckhorn lake. Iâ€™ve seen six foot bay park and it looks nice I would like to check out a couple more if anyone has any recommendations. Good boat docking is important and covered slips would be great if any of them offer that. Thx

1066696,Garnet,2020-10-20 19:18:00,2056,Spring Rock on Lower Buckhorn very nice.
1066712,gordy28,2020-10-21 12:33:00,638,My folks (and I) spent almost 40 years at Sandy Beach on Balsam Lake They do have a good boat dock area but they are not covered slips Cheers Andrew 
1066714,John,2020-10-21 12:46:00,2956,Both Spring Rock and Sandy Beach have zero vacancies for 2021...Stayed at Spring Rock in August and it is a nice park.
1066717,tomkat,2020-10-21 13:04:00,246,Thx for the info
1066833,Big Cliff,2020-10-24 10:40:00,6899,A little further South than you might want and no covered slips but Riverwood Park in Lindsay has a pretty good reputation. I live in the 4 season section and love it here. Let me know if you need more information.
1066837,John,2020-10-24 13:07:00,2956,Do they have vacancies?
1066856,Big Cliff,2020-10-25 09:24:00,6899,"Looking into it for you, will have information early this week."
1066863,sofabed,2020-10-25 16:04:00,119,I am in Lonesome Pine Trailer Park on Pigeon Lake. It's a great park. Look on Kijiji and you should see trailers for sale. I don't think there are any empty lots. One advantage they have over other parks is power at some of the boat docks if you need it. Most parks won't allow a generator to charge batteries.
1066901,Big Cliff,2020-10-26 21:10:00,6899,"Ok, talked to the owner of Riverwood , they do not have any seasonal openings for 2021 and have a waiting list of 30 to 40 people. They do have some sites that can be rented for weekend's or up to a month but thats it."
