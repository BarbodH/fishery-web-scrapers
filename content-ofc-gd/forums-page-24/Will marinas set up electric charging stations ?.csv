1068223,John Bacon,2020-12-08 04:45:00,3277,"Electric vehicles are heavier than gas powered ones.Â  That is a bigger disadvantage in boats than it is for cars & trucks.  	Electric vehicles are also more expensive upfront, but are cheaper to run.Â  But since most people don't put nearly as many miles on their boats as they do on their cars & trucks, there won't be nearly as many savings in operating costs to offset the initial purchase price.  	I think it will be a long time before fully electric boats are common."

1068246,craigdritchie,2020-12-08 20:24:00,1586,"I'm sure that one day electric boats will be the standard, but that day is still a long ways off. Torqeedo makes an 80 hp equivalent electric outboard which you can buy right now. It costs â‚¬39,000, or around $60,000 Canadian. Fortunately it comes with the two batteries needed to run it, which weigh approx. 300 pounds apiece. Per Torqeedo's website, maximum range on a full charge is around 12 hours, but that's based on running at 4 mph. At full throttle, it runs out of juice in 25 - 30 minutes. That's based on summer temperatures, by the way. As with all batteries, performance falls off in colder conditions. That Torqeedo motor has been on the market for six years now, so it's not like the price will drop once it gets out there. Boats are not like cars, the volumes required to drive prices down simply do not exist in the marine industry. And because pushing a boat through water takes a lot more energy than it does to roll a car on wheels, performance comparisons to automotive are just not valid. As far as marinas go, I can't see any of them eating the cost of installing charging stations until there is steady, consistent demand for it."

I bet they kept that price so low because when they finally tell you what the cost will be for the truck 80% of the people will back out of the deal and ask for their deposit.......errr....$150 back. In all seriousness there are some great EV's out there but I just do not think they will displace pickups or SUV's as our primary vehicleÂ in the near future.Â  Electric boats.....not in the foreseeable future and electric planes not until another battery technology becomes affordable.Â  I would not get in a plane that has a 30min range and a 30min reserveÂ ðŸ¤”"
1068256,AKRISONER,2020-12-09 14:48:00,5558,"Tesla has to keep the price low for the purpose of proof of concept. The first generation owners get a discount because Tesla needs people to go and take their truck and drive it and show everyone that holy cow an electric pickup truck is a real thing and that it works and does the things that most pickup trucks can do if not better? Heck anything at this point would be better than my ram which is in the shop once again... When gas prices inevitably hit 1.30 a litre again in 2022 when the economy is booming like its post ww2 with the pandemic over will the V8 drivers that front their own gas bills be thinking that not paying that gas bill is such a crazy idea? Everyone seemingly in this thread is exactly the reason Tesla has to eat cost to launch its vehicles. Without a belief in the technology and proof of concept you are never going to convert the gas guzzling pick up truck driver. Why do you think tesla has invested such absurd amounts of money installing their super chargers everywhere? Critical mass is literally the biggest challenge that the electric vehicle faces. Whats incredible is that Tesla is pulling it off it just has failed to convert everyone yet. Cars were the first and most common sense market to tackle. Trucks, planes, ATV's etc etc areÂ whats next. Much like outdoor power equipment, the conversion is swift once the proof of concept is proven in the market. Take a poll of how many people would buy a gas vs electric auger for ice fishing if they had the budget for it? 10 years ago this wasnt even on anyone's radar. Ill also mention that Tesla's ability to get 650,000 people to give them $150 for something that doesnt even exist yet, nor will it exist for many more years is far different than a deposit on an item that you will get in short turn. Im not even a ""tesla freak"" some people are obsessed with elon musk and all that he does, im a 2 stroke outboard driving, diesel truck owning dude with a 2 stroke snowmobile and gas auger! I just like many others (including a hell of a lot of people that buy stocks apparently) think that Tesla is on to something. They are making something that seemed futuristic, impossible, paradigm shifting and game changing right before our eyes. Youd never seen an electric car on the roads 10 years ago...my my how things have changed...in a very very short amount of time."

1068060,410001661,2020-12-03 15:13:00,127,"As with electric cars the only limitation is the infrastructure to support this technology.Â  I could not find any specs on the batteryÂ capacity but I would assume it would be close to that of a small/midsize EV).Â  A level 2 EVSE operates at 7.2kW @ 240V and takes approximately 8-15hrs to fully charge a battery of a PEV (plug in electric vehicle) or PHEVÂ (plug in hybrid electric vehicle).Â  This does not make much sense to put Leve 2 charging stations at marinas unless you are leaving your boat there overnight. Now if you want a fast charge 20-45min charge you can install a Level 3Â ESVE.Â  Level 3 ESVE's are very expensive to buy and provide the infrastructure to operate.Â  A level 3 EVSE are in the $40,000 - $60,000 range and will require 600V input (@ +/- 200A) per charging station.Â  That is close to the size of most marina's main service - if they can even get 600V.Â  Plus the EVSE's will need to be GFI protected due to the proximity of the water. I would not expect to see these are marinas any time soon."

I guess Tesla's have secret two stroke motors running them too lol The richest part about this entire debate is the fact that all of us already have 3-4 giant lead batteries in our boats already, yet were debating whether putting batteries in your boat is a good idea hahaha. What do people want from outboards? holeshot and top end. Guess what electric engines have? Basically unlimited tourque, no power band and a hypothetical unlimited top end. What do boats also do? travel in very relatively short distances. No one drives their boat 300km in a single day unless its a very very weird circumstance. If you have somehow convinced yourself that no one is going to attempt to embrace these facts then you probably also think tesla is going to go out of business lol."

1068192,410001661,2020-12-07 16:44:00,127,"I'm gonna steal a post I made on another site for this.Â  This is a feel food story.Â  Read the story and you will find that the plane only has a 30min flight time with a 30 min reserve.Â  A standard Beaver with a radial engine can haul 2,000lbs and has a range of 550 Nautical Miles (Max is 608 Nautical Miles).Â  That is a far cry from 30min of flight time. They do the same thing with the electric vehicles.......... People need to separate the feel good (emotional), and practicality of green energy and EV's. Companies have agenda's with EV's - Electrical OEM's support this technology because they want to expand their traditional electrical market and sell the EV Chargers. Knowing this will add additional burden to your electrical infrastructure they are more than willing to sell you new electrical equipment or to facilitate your upgrade and this is where they have an opportunity to make Millions. They are NOT doing this to be good corporate citizens, they are doing this because they have a horse in the race.  Look at this story https://www.auto123.com/en/news/eato...da-tour/21113/  Sounds amazing doesn't it.......gives you the warm and fuzzies? Look at all the executives posing by the car and charging station like they are about to do something amazing. What they are not telling you is that they used two Mitsubishi iMiEV's and a flatbed truck with a generator. They drove one EV and someone drove the truck with the other car on the back. When the first EV was getting low they swapped the cars and as they drive they ran the generator on the back of the truck to charge the other EV. So for this PR stunt they essentially ran a flatbed truck and a generator across Canada.......would love to see the carbon foot print on this one - LOL.  Another thing no one talks about is PEV/PHEV's are not for the average person. Look at the price of the cars- they are status symbols. They are designed for people that live in a suburban neighborhoods with a driveway that can afford the car, EV charger and have the infrastructure to operate it. How can people that rely on street parking, people in apartments/condo's charge their cars overnight if they do not have a dedicated EVSE to plug into at the end of each day?"
1068193,410001661,2020-12-07 17:02:00,127,"In theory yes........but in order to power this high performance electric motorÂ how many lead acidÂ batteries would you need?Â  Probably enough to sink your boat twice over.Â  In all honesty you would never use lead acidÂ batteries for this application (boat/car/plane) due to the weight and performance limitation of this technology.Â  You can go to a lithium ion battery that would cost you about 5 times that of a lead acid battery but that would put you at market disadvantage as your boat would be 2x or 3x that of a standard 4 stroke.Â  Yes, there are people that would spend $150k for an electric fishing boat that they could buy for $50k just like there are people that would spend $80-$100k for a Tesla vs a standard car. So now the discussion becomes are people buying these as status symbols or because you are saving the planet?Â  How are you towing this boat?Â  I sure hope you are towing with a Tesla pickup."
