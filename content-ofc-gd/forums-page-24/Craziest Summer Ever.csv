1066741,David Chong,2020-10-21 19:23:00,836,"As the open water season draws to a close and I reflect on this past season, MAN was it crazy! Not really sure what the new normal will be but I just want to get back to some kind of normal! that being said, sorry that I've been MIA for a good part of the summer. That being said our lakes and waterways seem to be busier than ever before with many new anglers drawn to our sport during these COVID times! Hopefully these newcomers will take the time to understand what it takes to be a responsible anglers, understanding MNR rules & regs., respecting the properties of others, etc. We will try to address as many of these things in on-line content as the ice season approaches! That being said, still managed to catch plenty of great fish! See below some fish porn from this past open water season! Will still get in a number of fun fishing outings before ice-up and looking forward to the up coming ice season! I hope that everyone has had a great summer and is staying safe & keeping well! It'll be ice fishing season in no time!                        "

1066743,AKRISONER,2020-10-21 19:35:00,5558,jeez daveÂ  you catch a lot of big ones lol Howd the tournament season go this year. I saw you got a second there in that open. Any other good finishes mixed in there?
1066744,David Chong,2020-10-21 19:41:00,836,"We've been lucky enough to get a few good ones here & there! It's been a fair tournament season, especially considering the fact that we didn't think that we would have one at all! We've won a couple of smaller events and had a fair number of top 10 finishes in larger events. Just focusing on a little fun fishing now!"
1066745,David Chong,2020-10-21 19:42:00,836,I have my Simms waders still and may head out on a stream shortly! I'll get a hold of you when I have time!
1066746,Terry,2020-10-21 19:42:00,14456,Nice fish
1066759,Rizzo,2020-10-22 02:00:00,4754,"awesome pictures. I was thinking oh wow this guy fishes for every species when i saw all the variety in the first photos, then it was bass, bass, bass, more bass, bass, bass, even more bass followed by some bass....I think I figured out your preference."
1066773,mamona,2020-10-22 14:00:00,597,"Geez, I did not expect so many pics with trophies in this post. Looks like you had a fantastic summer fishing."
1066776,bigcreekdad,2020-10-22 14:51:00,546,Can you send a few more pics...LOL. Very nice fish!
1066778,farsider,2020-10-22 15:24:00,456,Thanks for posting Dave!  Some real beauties.Â  Pics are really stunning! It is football season after all! Yowza Cheers
1066785,Whitespinnerbait,2020-10-22 21:56:00,2038,The camo pattern on some of those Smallies..........ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž Phenomenal fishing right there !!!! 
1066797,LeXXington,2020-10-23 02:11:00,1928,All great pictures
1066802,David Chong,2020-10-23 14:09:00,836,Got out for some Jumboâ€™s yesterday! Lots of small fish but we ran into a few good ones! 
1066806,aplumma,2020-10-23 18:28:00,6896,Thank you for all of the great pictures Dave. We had kind of a damper down here with the COVID and such so I didn't get out as often as I wanted. We had a really good season down here with the Snakeheads and the Bass. The water temperatures have cooled down to a point where the Snakehead bite is over for the season but next year it should fire up again. As I have said before if you are near the Potomac River give me a shout and we can get after a few of the local species. Art 
1066807,David Chong,2020-10-23 18:58:00,836,Really appreciate that offer again Art! Iâ€™m looking forward to when we can cross the border and experience the many fishing opportunities down there! Hopefully weâ€™ll be able to take you up on that offer sooner rather than later! Stay safe & keep well!

1066971,David Chong,2020-10-28 23:16:00,836,"Smallmouth Bass! I'd eat a lot of other fish before a Smallmouth Bass, that being said many moons ago when we used to camp a lot more we did keep some for a meal now & then!"
