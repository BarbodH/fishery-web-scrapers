Had a few bites, saw a couple bows splash. Didn’t catch anything. But it was a great day spent on the river. Hopefully it will turn on soon with the rain coming    "
1066683,misfish,2020-10-19 22:10:00,29133,Many have come and gone way up. More to come I am sure.
1066684,LefroyFisherman,2020-10-19 22:13:00,602,I normally don’t fish that area until around now til it freezes.
1066685,JonnyButts,2020-10-19 22:15:00,40,Little guy looks like he was having a blast 👍🏻Thanks for the report!
1066686,LefroyFisherman,2020-10-19 22:19:00,602,"He loves fishing! It’s great, it’s kinda odd he likes it though being he has ADHD. But he does pay super attention to stuff he enjoys."
1066761,LefroyFisherman,2020-10-22 02:25:00,602,Got one today  6.6 pound hen 
1066777,bigcreekdad,2020-10-22 14:52:00,546,Love that boy's smile.
1066978,antonio77,2020-10-29 13:55:00,32,Great one do most of you go south or more near Wassaga to fish? please advise Thanks
1066982,LefroyFisherman,2020-10-29 14:05:00,602,"Can’t do much fishing south of 90, although there is a huge tree dam farther up north, it’s been there for almost a decade I think. Maybe 100 feet or more in length of brush and trees."
1066983,antonio77,2020-10-29 14:13:00,32,anything north of 90 is good  right?
1067000,BillM,2020-10-30 00:37:00,17367,Be weary of the zero possession limit if you're fishing above the Pine and downstream of the Boyne.    All steelhead must be released.
1067016,antonio77,2020-10-30 13:12:00,32,"Yup! Thanks BillM It is all about the fun, not fishing for food"
