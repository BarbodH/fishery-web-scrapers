1067827,David Chong,2020-11-26 14:13:00,836,"The last few years, I have not had a chance to fish Lake Erie very often so this fall I decided to change that up. Made a total of 5 trips down to one of a truly world class Smallmouth bass fishery! The last one was just before the blow and we managed to win a small local tournament with 5 Smallies for a total of 28.98 lbs. We had some good days out there but never really caught the peak of the fall action, there is still a few days left in the season maybe we'll be able to get out one more time. Here are some beautiful Erie bronze to help us make it through a long winter!            "

1067834,David Chong,2020-11-26 15:48:00,836,"When Erie peaks, we are talking upwards of 100 fish days per person! LOL Next year you should come down for a fish!"

1067912,David Chong,2020-11-28 02:17:00,836,Correct!
1067919,dave524,2020-11-28 16:15:00,4508,"The fishing has only improved since dad would put a green 5 1/2 Johnson in the trunk of the '52 Pontiac and we would rent a 16' cedar strip for 50cents an hour or $3 for the day from Ray Prophet of Ray's Boat Livery, drift fish with crayfish we dredged from a local pond.Â  5's are just as common now as 3's were back then . Zebra mussels made the water clearer and Gobies fattened them up."
