1066558,captpierre,2020-10-15 00:05:00,2521,Slapped this Reef Runner boatside to get some weeds off and the tongue snapped off. Didn’t slap it hard at all.  Makes me wonder how this design will manage a big fish. .  Have caught lots of big eyes and Muskies on crankbaits where line attaches to tongue instead of body. Will epoxy this tongue in. Maybe should reinforce all my tongues before they break. 
1066564,OhioFisherman,2020-10-15 10:18:00,6623,I wouldn't think it would be as strong glued in with epoxy?
1066570,Snidley,2020-10-15 12:52:00,620,That used to happen to my Bagley B Flat lures when a big steelhead nailed them hard. They kept the lure I would get the lip back. Steelies don't like to be trifled with it seems.
1066571,captpierre,2020-10-15 12:52:00,2521,You’re probably right. I’ll do my best to repair  then crank on it before I use it. Would be stupid to lose a good fish over a weak lure.
1066573,bigcreekdad,2020-10-15 13:44:00,546,"I've done this... slapping too hard and too often. I finally changed when I found I was slapping so hard that I was opening up my swivels. Now, if weeds don't come off after a couple mild slaps, I remove them manually. Really stupid on my part...if weeds didn't come off after a slap, I'd just repeat, with each slap getting harder. Talk about lazy."
1066581,Snidley,2020-10-15 14:37:00,620,"Slapping your lure on the water to dislodge weeds will sometimes break them , it will at all times knock them ""out of tune""."
1066583,PUMP KNOWS,2020-10-15 15:33:00,937,"I don’t slap my lures on the water, I’ve seen lures break to often.  I got the habit of just picking the weeds off my lures"

1066607,Mr Greedydrift,2020-10-16 03:30:00,25,Some 30lb stainless steel line from the hook eye to the split ring on the lip would fix that bait. Drill a hole thru the lip just behind the ring. You could epoxy the line underneath.
1066608,Yellow Fever,2020-10-16 11:08:00,139,"I would not use it again, you lose a fish on it and you will be kicking your butt for the second time. It's a $10.00 lesson"
1066751,Cleithrum,2020-10-21 22:08:00,5,I suspect gluing it on or adding hardware will negatively impact the action.
1066752,captpierre,2020-10-21 22:14:00,2521,You might be right. Put 3 coats of 5 min epoxy on joint. Seems super strong. Will put in water and let you know. Stay tuned.
1066757,Mr Greedydrift,2020-10-22 00:52:00,25,I hope it holds up for you. I've not had much luck with 5 min epoxy being underwater. Envirotex is the way to go for lure coating and repair.
