1066269,JonnyButts,2020-10-03 15:04:00,40,"Hey OFC . Used to be active on this board about 13 years ago. Never really left but had been lurking for a longtime . The worst kind of member!  Life went sideways and addiction got the best of me. Been clean for over 4 years now and busy fixing the 3 ringed circus that was my life. Finally figured it’s time to get back at er now that 2 of my boys are in university and it’s just the weeun at home. Reconnected with my old buddy Meeps and he got the musky fever back in my life . Been losing more big girls than I’ve landed , which is frustrating but I’m still on em and consumed with the thought of a 50” plus. Still early in the fall and lots of trips planned , I think I’ll get that 50” in the net soon! Pictured is a nice fish I got after losing 2 that day, Meeps was quick in the water and did the net work for me, held her up quick while I snapped a pic and back in the drink she went. Musky fishing is some sort of psychological mind F@(£ , from watching videos and trips to the local shop, online orders , countless hours on the water throwing lures as big as my dog and all around being consumed by these fish, I think I got the bug bad.  The wee man has really caught the fishing bug and has been on me to catch his first Salmon , we’ve been down to our local spot a bunch and he just hasn’t tied into one yet. This morning while he and his buds opted to head out for smallies , I checked in with the apps and saw that there was a minor moon phase and wind conditions in my favour so back down to the local I go. Chucking spoons for a good 3 hours with not a whiff , decided to throw on the ole Rapala and first cast had a big girl smoke it. What a fight she put up. A bunch of runs and acrobatics and she finally hit the net. Some how I managed to have the front trebles in her , Thank God, as you can see she snapped that rapala in half. All in all the fishing has been great and amongst these crazy times I can always find my solstice down at the water. I’ll keep posting and appreciate all the members who have been doing so for years. Tight Lines  J.B."

1066271,JonnyButts,2020-10-03 15:30:00,40,"Thanks Lew. I always loved reading your Musky reports back then. I’ll take your word on that first 50 , I know ya got the experience !"
1066273,Toronto_Angler,2020-10-03 17:14:00,698,Welcome back and congrats on turning your life around! Sweet Muskys!
1066275,JonnyButts,2020-10-03 19:24:00,40,"Thanks Toronto_Angler , it’s good to be back !"
1066276,misfish,2020-10-03 20:56:00,29133,  They do not make fish like they use too. LOL  Welcome back .
1066277,JonnyButts,2020-10-03 21:15:00,40,"LOL, they sure don’t . Thanks for the welcome back Brian, always enjoy your reports from the toon!"
1066278,Rizzo,2020-10-03 23:54:00,4754,that is one heck of a comeback...great report
1066279,discophish,2020-10-03 23:58:00,392,"Thank you for your claim to overcome your challenges, and for the excellent fishing report.  Mental health and addiction is an enormous mass that holds people down.  Expressing the importance of awareness and avoiding the cloak of its darkness is a true testament to helping youself as we as others.  It is so valuable to recognize how an individual like youself can lift themselves up from such a vulnerable situation and turn life around.  You have fought your way through to surviving the harshest pain, and your passion is supported by this fishing community so continue to be strong by doing what you love to do!  Now get out and catch more fish.  Congrats on all of your successes!"
1066281,bigcreekdad,2020-10-04 01:53:00,546,Welcome back dude! 
1066298,JonnyButts,2020-10-04 23:22:00,40,Thanks Guys. Thanks Discophish . I just put my truth out there . I’m finally living life the way I was supposed to be. I appreciate the comment. Tight Lines J.B.
1066310,AKRISONER,2020-10-05 13:33:00,5558,"isnt it true, fishing is the best damn therapy in the world Those damn Rapalas or as me and my buddies call em ""crapolas"" A couple recent trips out for me had me thinking I was losing my bloody mind when i kept having giant smallmouth after giant smallmouth come unpinned on a DT-10. I dont know why i didnt think of it earlier but of course, I examined the hooks and sure enough every single one was bent outwards slightly. The damn hooks couldnt hand when a 4+lb smallie smashed the bait while cranking, it bent all of the hooks. Thanks for the report, theres truly not enough of it around here anymore. People either too uptight about where they fish like they are some type of fishing god, or folks are just too lazy to do the amount of work it takes to edit photos, and actually write something worth reading. Im sure the guys on here that either A: have difficulty posting photos etc or B cant fish anymore appreciate them even more than I do.  Thanks for taking the time and I hope you stick around and keep posting more!"
1066320,PUMP KNOWS,2020-10-05 16:03:00,937,Good stuff man. Have you gone back where you caught your salmon?  Are they doing construction or have they fenced up the whole are to prevent people from fishing it?
1066323,JonnyButts,2020-10-05 16:22:00,40,"Fished there yesterday . Parking lot is closed but could still walk in , Word from the old boys is we are losing access for 2 months while they place rock piles in the water . I emailed the city to see what is actually going on there since I can’t seem to find any info online . Really going to suck losing even more access down there and especially right in brown prime time. I guess I’ll throw the waders on and join the boys in the “hole” till it’s done."
1066324,JonnyButts,2020-10-05 16:23:00,40,I wish Rapala built them worth the $10 bucks a lure they are. I’ll be posting reports everytime I get the net wet . It’s good to be back !
1066325,lew,2020-10-05 16:38:00,12766,"A dozen years ago a musky tore this Believer apart and spit the pieces back at me. I emailed this picture to Drifter Tackle and within a couple days they sent me 2 new lures as replacements with a letter of apology for the bad lure. Good companies look after their customers, maybe try the same thing with Rapala.  "
1066333,JonnyButts,2020-10-05 20:03:00,40,"How big was that fish Lew? That’s some sage advice , I’m going to email Rapala tonight when I get back in from fishing ."
1066334,lew,2020-10-05 20:31:00,12766,It happened so fast I never even saw the fish but my partner did & said it was a goodun.
1067056,JonnyButts,2020-10-31 18:54:00,40,"Hey fellas , just wanted to update. On Lew’s advice I emailed Rapala (Nordstrom) they responded and I got a replacement lure and some stickers and a hat in the mail yesterday. Good to see a brand stand behind their product. "
1067057,lew,2020-10-31 19:16:00,12766,Always good when a plan comes together and nice to hear Rapala looks after their customers.
1067125,antonio77,2020-11-03 15:17:00,32,great topics guys may I ask where the pictures were taken on that dock posted by Jonny?
1067819,David Chong,2020-11-26 13:37:00,836,"Great report & congrats on defeating your demons! My addiction has always been fishing and it has kept me clear of other temptations! Keep at it, you'll get that 50 incher!"
