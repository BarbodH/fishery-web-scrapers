1067187,BillM,2020-11-06 01:23:00,17367,"Same water temps in Gbay, 1 guy, 10 hrs, zero muskies lol"
1067196,LostAnotherOne,2020-11-06 02:29:00,956,We'll it's going to be home jobs this weekend for me.  Will try again next weekend.
1067200,Rizzo,2020-11-06 03:30:00,4754,"ugg heading up tomorrow we will see. Won't have computer access til Sunday or so, will let you know how we did"
1067202,captpierre,2020-11-06 03:38:00,2521,Even tried drop shotting gulp adjacent to humps with weeds for blue gills and smallies.  That always works typically. Not a sniff today at 3 locations.
1067229,Rizzo,2020-11-08 01:44:00,4754,"we just got back from Pigeon, fished Friday and Saturday. We caught 4 for the two days and lost one more. Water temps Friday morning were 43.5 but were up to 47 by the time we left there this afternoon."
1067230,LostAnotherOne,2020-11-08 02:44:00,956,Thanks for the report.  Well done👍
1067235,BillM,2020-11-08 18:03:00,17367,Nice man!  Any bigguns?
1067242,Rizzo,2020-11-09 01:50:00,4754,nopers...all were in the 35-37 inch range. The one we lost at boatside...waiting for the net to show up...was about 40. It was hooked with only 8 feet of line out so our net man wasn't ready when we had the fish at boatside. Still had to complete his retrieve etc...pretty sure he wanted me to lose it
1067258,BillM,2020-11-10 02:33:00,17367,LOL!  A muskie is a muskie
1067262,lifeisfun,2020-11-10 10:45:00,99,@Rizzo Good job! Good to see the couch didn't win in making the decision to go or not to go
1067401,Tjames09,2020-11-15 15:55:00,664,It took me 3 days on Pigeon before I got one.....Tough lake lately. Gets fished hard.
1067404,lifeisfun,2020-11-15 16:25:00,99,"If it was easy everybody would do it Seme on the Ottawa for me fish or two every outing but you have to put the time in to it. Feels like private river, didn't see boat for long time!"
1067445,Rizzo,2020-11-16 13:01:00,4754, ya we were hesitant to go there. Our last fall trip to Pigeon we were 0 for 1 in 2.5 days of fishing....then we remembered that can happen anywhere and decided to go for it anyways!
1067447,LostAnotherOne,2020-11-16 13:13:00,956,The lure of the great muskellunge always brings us back.
1067593,Rizzo,2020-11-20 03:21:00,4754,well got out there one more time (this past Tuesday) and we had to work for it. One for one...38.5 inches. Normally I wouldn't measure fish that size but it was the first for a friend of mine so we had to get an accurate measurement. It certainly made his day! Water temps were 42-43 degrees
1067679,captpierre,2020-11-22 19:43:00,2521,Been a tough fall on Pigeon. Hit quite a few decent ones trolling with deeper diving walleye baits near bottom around structure at 1.5 mph in Sept-early Oct.  Ended up always bringing my big Muskie net along. Every fish lip hooked. Was lucky to land most even without leader. You would think a 42-45 would gulp a 5 inch crankbait down deep. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Makes unhooking so much easier.
