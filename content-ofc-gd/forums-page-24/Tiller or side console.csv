Sold without a leaky rivet, sold for 65% what I paid for it new.  So in other words, Lund is the recommendation here."

1067480,Fisherman,2020-11-17 16:18:00,7201,Pretty sure they have a splashwell back there.
1067484,akaShag,2020-11-17 17:48:00,2073,"Pictures show a solid splashwell, yes, but methinks the outboard is going to wallow in the waves.  That was on an 18 foot tiller model for sale by some marina. Funny enough, every once in a while I think I might let my beloved Sylvan go and get something newer.  Stanley sure looks attractive, and thanks for that. Doug"

1066835,Garnet,2020-10-24 12:31:00,2056,Another consideration is how early you get out in spring and how late into fall you fish. Tiller offers no protection and console some. All tiller boats can be changed to console at a later date. It only takes money.
1066838,dave524,2020-10-24 13:17:00,4508,"I fished  20 years out of an 18 ' aluminum centre console with a bimini, mainly trolling Erie and Ontario, worked well for me"
1066848,DRIFTER_016,2020-10-24 20:14:00,10439,The first one should keep you in that range and has .100 versus .067 aluminum and has the extra length and beam width. I believe it would be a better purchase in the long run.
1066853,Fisherman,2020-10-24 21:59:00,7201,Good for resale value down the road.
1066892,BassMan11,2020-10-26 15:45:00,583,"Tiller for sure with what you will be doing. Be patient, go used and be constantly on FB market place, Kijiji and of course the classified's here when you are really seriously looking. For longevity, stick with Cresliner, Lund, Alumacraft imo.  The well looked after boats and good deals are gone in minutes. Also be willing to drive a long way to see a boat.  I bought a used 2014 Lund Pro Guide 1675 in 2017 off a guy on kijiji in great shape for under 20K. I was the first to call and in 1 hour he has received 20 phone calls to buy the boat. Good luck with your search!"
1066894,msp,2020-10-26 16:02:00,1336,You may also want to consider the horsepower and weight distribution expected. I have a 16 ft SC with a 50 hp and if it was a tiller it would probably have a hard time getting up on plane with my fat a$$ at the back of the boat. I do love the open space of a tiller tho
1066966,tomkat,2020-10-28 22:34:00,246,I started with a side console then I had a full windshield now I have a tiller. They all have pros and cons but the tiller is my favourite so far. I like the tiller arm much better than a steering wheel for trolling and for a 17 foot boat the space is pretty good. The full windshield boat was the same size but space was tight and the windshield acted like a sail if you were drift fishing. One thing I miss from my last boat is a rear casting platform but I think I might build one. The other boats were more versatile as family boats but I’m not pulling kids around anymore so this works for me.
1067109,Heavy Current,2020-11-02 23:17:00,20,That’s a sweet ride Tomkat
1067111,tomkat,2020-11-03 02:49:00,246,Thx. I just kinda stumbled across the boat and picked it up cheap. I sold the old 2 stroke that was on it and put the new Yamaha on it and added a nice Lowrance. The carpet was in bad shape and literally floating at the back of the boat so I Replaced it with vinyl. I had a soft spot where the rear seat is so I cut it out and put in some new plywood and now it’s solid. These old Rangers have composite stringers and transom so they are pretty durable. 30 years old and doesn’t leak a drop.
1067136,JoshS,2020-11-03 22:16:00,729,Think it totally depends on where and how you fish. 75% of the year I like my open concept boat. But the next boat I'm getting is a full windshield I think. I've fished the full windshield late year and think I'm convinced it's the way to go for me next boat.
1067138,tomkat,2020-11-03 23:26:00,246,For sure. If you fish late fall through November the windshield and the top would be awesome. I will fish into October but I pick my days based on wind and weather.
1067147,lew,2020-11-04 07:54:00,12766,You won't ever regret that decision
1067153,gordy28,2020-11-04 16:29:00,638,"One of the best set ups I have ever fished out of was on a trip to Brennan Harbour Lodge Its on Lake Huron and they had the option to upgrade to a 17.5 foot Lund Outfitter with a 50 HP Yamaha Tiller with all of the fixings (power start, tilt, RPM monitor for trolling)  - it was awesome even on rough days I will say though I am not sure it would be super comfortable come the fall (our trip was in August and it was 30 Degrees everyday) compared to a dual windshield I don't own a boat currently - have a kayak and various OPB (other peoples boats) I fish out of when at the cottage and such but I have always thought that when I am ready to buy a boat I would like a tiller set up like that Lund at Brennan Harbour Cheers Andrew "
1067170,BillM,2020-11-05 01:41:00,17367,"I can see the appeal of a tiller, all that deck space, etc.   But when the crap weather comes (and it always does)  full windshield with a top is the only way to go, especially if you are fishing early or late in the season."
1067177,Heavy Current,2020-11-05 19:01:00,20,I don’t think there is no such thing as the perfect boat .. But I do think a tiller is as close as it gets.Yes full windshield all covered in would b nice but how do u fish properly? If it’s windy u have a sail and pushes the boat . If ur trolling and u gotta stick it tight a tiller is the only way to go .. drifting the same .. I guess if ur old and can’t keep warm in a tiller u r probably just trolling under the canopy ... long runs on a open lake ya dress like ur goin on the snowmobile...jiggin trolling casting drifting and staying vertical a tiller is downtown..But that’s just my opinion
1067178,Garnet,2020-11-05 20:51:00,2056,At anytime you can buy a console BPS sells them use your same motor and switch to console. Cost is something I would look into.
1067184,Heavy Current,2020-11-06 00:42:00,20,I would suggest if u have a tiller and want a console boat to sell ur tiller and buy a console .. cheeper then pissin around trying to convert 1 way or other
1067188,BillM,2020-11-06 01:30:00,17367,"You've never fished out of a full console boat have you, lol.    I've been as close as 15ft to shore in some spots the last month fishing muskies on Gbay.   Full top, pouring rain I'm warm and dry and enjoying myself.   I didn't even have to put my Guidewear on.   Having the enclosure up and it being windy makes zero difference, with the kicker and Terrova with IPilot Link, it's effortless.   Hell I could have a nap out there and touch nothing and just let the boat do all the work"

I just prefer fishing out of tiller because u can adapt to a lot more situations better .. just my opinion

1066764,pike slayer,2020-10-22 11:22:00,1177,"I want to buy a new boat for next spring and I’m unsure with what I want. I’ve fished out of a tinner bench seats my whole life and want to upgrade. I’m looking at boats like the prince craft resorter, Lund fury, and mirrocraft outfitter or laker. I want a boat that I can have all my gear in launch and go. But is a steering wheel really needed? It would be sweet to giver to another spot driving with one but that’s typically only a few min drive. I fish all in land lakes. And do I upgrade to a bow mount trolling motor or keep using a transom mount electric?"
1066765,lew,2020-10-22 12:22:00,12766,"I've had them all, tiller, side console and full windshield and they all have good and bad points depending on what your doing. Tillers are nice, as long as they have a flat floor, as that makes moving around the boat easy with no obstructions but they offer no protection from lousy wet days. I had a Crestliner 1650 SC for a long time and the side console was nice as it gave the driver protection from the elements when running around the lake on nasty days but does nothing for the passenger(s). You do have to work around the console but I never found that to be an issue and the bigger the boat the less hassle it will be. You don't mention full windshield boats so I assume you don't want one but they sure are nice, especially with a fully enclosed top that protects everyone when the weathers is cold and wet and the cold fall winds are howling. As I said above they all have good points and bad, you just have to pick whet works best for your style of fishing."
1066766,Mr Greedydrift,2020-10-22 12:24:00,25,"I think it depends on what kind of fishing that you do. I have a side console because I like to troll for salmon with downriggers and also muskie with rod holders. I like that I can see the rods while sitting at the console. It is possible to do those things with a tiller but I would not like to fish like that. If you do alot of casting then a tiller would have the advantage with all the deck space available. I also cast from my single console with no problems, but I have fished in a dual console with a full windshield and I didn't like the restricted space up front. For the electric trolling motors if you buy a boat with a front casting platform you will eventually need a bow mount. Keep the transom electric for something like backtrolling for walleye. It would be versatile to have electrics front and back. 👍"
1066767,lew,2020-10-22 12:51:00,12766,Not disagreeing with you but if you buy the proper full windshield boat you can have more front deck space than lots of single console boats and the windshield won't interfere with your casting either. I could dance on the front deck of my last boat with all the room it had. Nothing like a bass boat of course but the protection from the elements made up for it....at least in my opinion.  
1066768,John,2020-10-22 13:13:00,2956,If it was solely for fishing and I fished by myself or with another guy all the time I would invest in a 17' or 18' tiller. I don't get the side console option as I don't think they offer much in the way of protection. As I fish only part of the time and the rest is recreational boating a full windshield and bimini works for me.
1066770,sauce,2020-10-22 13:37:00,219,16 feet and under go with a tiller. A 16 foot tiller will have almost as much open space as an 18 foot side console. If you are planning to fish off the bow at all then get a bow mount motor.  It might cost more up front but a 24V setup will provide plenty of power and less likely to drain your batteries during a long day on the water.
1066771,Terry,2020-10-22 13:43:00,14456,"It depends on the type of fishing you do and the lakes you fish. Lake Ontario, Simcoe. Steering wheel. But if you fish smaller lakes, if you troll shorelines, if you back troll   I would go with a tiller every time"

1066775,bigcreekdad,2020-10-22 14:48:00,546,"Similar to others, I've had both over 35 years of owning boats. I prefer a tiller, and have gotten 21 seasons so far out of my Alumacraft Magnum 165, with a 60hp Yamaha. As others have said, it depends on the type of fishing and the water you fish.  If you troll a lot, and if on any bigger water, a side console is probably the way to go. However, I seldom troll, and do a lot of bait and drop shotting...usually drifting. As such, I have so much better boat control while fishing with a tiller, and am able to react quickly to changes I see on my graph. If I am casting from my raised front deck, I cannot imagine not having my bow mounted 24v trolling motor. As for size we have fished 3 from my 16.5' boat pretty easily when doing mostly drifting and drop shotting. For casting, we have done 3, but I much prefer 2. In fact, I won't cast with 3 unless it's with my two sons. I envy you shopping for a new boat. Good luck, and be sure and report back. "

1066793,Old Ironmaker,2020-10-23 00:44:00,8243,"All good responses. It all depends on needs. Tiller = more real estate, more room. Side council=more comfort. As long as there is enough room to stretch ones legs a tiller  is fine for a smaller 16' or less tinny.  Larger than 15' side council for me with a real deal wind shield that protects my head not just my body with only a bit of tucking behind it. Fishing smaller inland lakes big cold waves smaking you in the face probably isn't an issue. If possible spend a few days behind the wheel of a side council and then decide what is best for you personally, because it is a personal preference. My knees got so bad I couldn't run the tiller anymore because my legs were all crunched up behind the seat in front of me in the 14' tinny."

1066830,DRIFTER_016,2020-10-24 01:01:00,10439,"In my opinion this would be a much better purchase. The aluminum used is 36% thicker making a more durable hull. Not sure how much the G3 is but the Crestliner 16' is 17""  longer and 25"" wider. It will be much more stable and I would bet the tires on the trailer are bigger than the little 12"" ones on the G3 package. Bigger wheels mean less wear and tear on the bearings and tires. https://www.crestliner.com/vision/1600-vision-tiller/ And if you really want to go for broke the Pro Tiller looks bad a$$. https://www.crestliner.com/pro-tiller/1650-pro-tiller/"
