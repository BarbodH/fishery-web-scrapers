1066665,JonnyButts,2020-10-18 23:28:00,40,"Had a good weekend of fishing. Safe to say the fall temperatures have arrived. Started out Friday night with my pal Mepps , we got out and successfully washed all the musky lures we had on hand. Seems like the fish have pushed off and moved out of the early fall spots we were previously having success on. It‚Äôs always a good time when I get out with Mepps and with¬†a friendship spanning¬†20 or so years , it makes for lots to reminisce and talk about . Friday -Fish 1 - Jonny -NIL  Early Saturday morning , myself and 2 of my sons headed out to the Upper Niagara. I had booked with a local guide . 6 hours of smallie hunting was on the menu . Should have know when the sunrise was so red that the weather would be dicey. ‚ÄúRed sky in the morning , sailors take warning ‚Äúor something like that my Papa used to say.  We launched out from Black Creek and started drifting and drop shottin plastics . 2 hours and nothing much happening . We switch over to swimbaits and start casting . I got a dink just before the rain moved in.  Rain was not in the forecast but rain is what we got , wind picked up going opposite the current which created some interesting waters to be out on. We kept casting . Somewhere in between getting rained and splashed I tied into a nice smallie , biggest of this season by a pound or two.  Another 2 hours of nada and our time was up. Neither of the lads caught anything but we did have a good time out there and the banter was top notch .  Saturday- Fish 2 - Jonny -half a nil  Got up this morning and headed over to the job site to make sure my operator and gas tech got set up alright . Finished up there by 10 am and decided to head down to the local and cast some spoons. Only myself and another guy with the waders on. We took turns landing fish. Caught some big males and a couple of females with eggs still spitting out of them. Restocked on Roe which is always great with the browns starting to come in .  Sunday finished out great, definitely time to break out my insulated waders as I was freezing my nards off today in my lites. Lost a bunch of hardware but when you have a multiple fish day it doesn‚Äôt seem to hurt that bad .  Back to work tomorrow but this time of year it won‚Äôt be more than a day or two before I‚Äôm casting a line for something somewhere .  Tight Lines J.B.  "
1066667,Rizzo,2020-10-19 02:33:00,4754,good read nice you got into some fish....those dang musky can be so frustrating though
1066669,misfish,2020-10-19 09:30:00,29133,"Nice few days. The weekend was not bad as they called for. Rain did not start here til around 10 am. Yup,I was looking at the neos yesterday and dusted them off.  "
1066670,JonnyButts,2020-10-19 10:36:00,40,"They are the most challenging fishing out there in my opinion but when one explodes on a big lure , ain‚Äôt nothing like it in fresh water fishing!  Gotta love the weather man eh Misfish, only job where you can be wrong all the time and not get fired for it. What Union do they have üòÇ ?"

1066678,lew,2020-10-19 20:33:00,12766,Been about 3 years now since I quit fishing but I still miss those big hit's
1066679,JonnyButts,2020-10-19 20:39:00,40,Weather bad up there or the fishing Mamona? There really isn‚Äôt anything like it Lew. I‚Äôm still on the hunt for that 50‚Äù this season.
1066923,BillM,2020-10-27 17:01:00,17367,Those 50s are tough nuts to crack
1066924,LostAnotherOne,2020-10-27 18:15:00,956,"There's a guy I work with who has a picture of him holding a 53"" on his office wall.¬† First and only time muskie fishing for him.¬† He's a nice guy, but I think I hate him."
1066953,gordy28,2020-10-28 13:58:00,638,Looks like a great outing - fall fishing can really be spectacular (although my two outings have only delivered dink smallies and a rock bass lol) Andrew 
1066972,David Chong,2020-10-28 23:19:00,836,"Well, at least you caught some fish, good stuff! As for the weather, should we ever be surprised when the weatherman is wrong?"
