1067944,squirrel761,2020-11-29 22:08:00,30,A friend gave me this wondering what it is. It consists of what looks like a single strand of braided wire or chicken coop wire with a swivel on one end and a 2 ounce weight on the other end. looks like surveyors tape weaved through the wire. I though maybe an early version of a bottom bouncer.

1067951,smitty55,2020-11-30 02:09:00,928,Bottom depth finder for ice fishing was my first thought. Easy to spot when it reaches the surface when a good distance away as you walk back.
1067953,OhioFisherman,2020-11-30 13:17:00,6623,"A bottom bouncer would be my guess, not an early version but a home made one  Lots of ways to make them I have used copper grounding wire in the past, it doesn't snag on rocks an easily as a lot of sinker styles."
1067958,squirrel761,2020-11-30 14:51:00,30,That’s what I’m thinking. It was bought at True Value Hardware store in 1994. Price was $3.49. Package still has the sticker on it.
1067987,RayK,2020-12-01 13:50:00,25,"It’s a bait catcher, also called “pilchard rings”. I first used one in the 70’s while fishing off a Pier in Florida, everyone was using them to catch small bait fish which they would then use to catch “real fish”. They sold them in the little fishing shop that was on the Pier. It was simply lowered into the water, and the bait fish would be all over it, attracted to the colourful material, and many would get their gills stuck in the wire loops. It was very effective. Ray.      "
1067989,dave524,2020-12-01 15:03:00,4508," Bingo, we have a winner, seems they have been illegal for some time now, at least in Florida"
1067998,squirrel761,2020-12-01 17:18:00,30,Thanks a lot Ray. Mystery solved. Never would have guessed that one.
1068002,RayK,2020-12-01 20:35:00,25,"Your welcome! As you can see by the size of those hoops, they caught fair sized “bait”, compared to what I normally call a minnow  but then again, it was saltwater. Ray "
1068003,OhioFisherman,2020-12-01 20:59:00,6623,"Ray, another thank you, I googled bottom bouncing rigs and nothing was really close, but it showed after your clue."
1068016,squirrel761,2020-12-02 03:20:00,30,"Yes, I did the same and there are lots of how to videos on how to make these."
1068021,aplumma,2020-12-02 13:05:00,6896,This has been replaced by a Sabinki rig which is 6 small hooks with mylar as the bait. We use them to catch bait. Art
1068046,smitty55,2020-12-03 01:38:00,928,Those Sabiki rigs wouldn't be legal here without removing two of the hooks. I know a guy that has used them for herring but he said they're a pain to use as the tend to get all tangled up.
