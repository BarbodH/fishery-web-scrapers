1066843,Tjames09,2020-10-24 17:04:00,664,Some boat launches don‚Äôt have docks (like the one in pidgeon). The only option is to shore the boat in the sand/rock.  how do you guys feel about doing this with your boat? I see some pretty nice. Oats launch in these areas.
1066845,Fisherman,2020-10-24 17:38:00,7201,"Been doing it for a long time, just remember to wear boots and push the boat out a bit when climbing in or out.¬† Pick your spot away from pointy rocks"
1066847,Rizzo,2020-10-24 18:34:00,4754,"I have occasionally camped in some rough spots overnight, so what I have done is tie boat to something on the shore, let it float out a bit...like a couple feet, then drop an anchor off the back to hold boat in place. If it is just for launching, then yes, I carefully pull it up onto the shore."
1066850,irishfield,2020-10-24 20:54:00,26272,I look for a log... 
1066867,Old Man,2020-10-25 18:45:00,822,You could always install a keel guard. 
1066879,DanD,2020-10-26 09:04:00,2223,"What I did was to tie about 30 feet of¬†3/8""bungee cord to an¬†anchor. Drop it in the water so that I could still reach shore by the time the bungee was fully stretched. Tie a bow line off to a tree or whatever and then let the bungee pull the boat back out to the deeper water. you can buy rolls of bungee from places like Princess Auto Princess Auto Dan."
1066922,BillM,2020-10-27 16:57:00,17367,"It's a boat, you do what you've gotta do."
1066929,Garnet,2020-10-27 20:01:00,2056,If I don't shore my boat I can't go fishing. Sucks that I own that boat.
1066938,AKRISONER,2020-10-28 01:22:00,5558,Keel guard all day
1066979,dave524,2020-10-29 13:57:00,4508,Get an aluminum¬†üëç
1066993,grimsbylander,2020-10-29 20:28:00,3016,I‚Äôve got a glass boat with a keel guard and that boat has been beached plenty of times. It‚Äôs a boat after all. The topside is for looks and the bottom is for business. Lol
1067392,mikeh,2020-11-15 01:17:00,824,power poles work great 
1067393,LefroyFisherman,2020-11-15 02:27:00,602,"I launch alone a fair bit, and I just tie the bow rope to the back of the trailer, back up and the boat floats off and I just pull it to shore gently with the truck. I've gotten some looks and people wondering if the boat is just going to float away like they think I forgot to tie it off lol.  "
1067397,Fisherman,2020-11-15 14:04:00,7201,That's my procedure.
1067400,Tjames09,2020-11-15 15:53:00,664,"Thanks, thats what I was doing. I just hate that feeling of dragging the boat up the sand. Theres always small rocks and whatnot in the sand."
1067402,sauce,2020-11-15 16:03:00,219,"Try to find a couple of 3-4' farm poles. 4-6"" diameter would probably be good. Lay them next to each other along shore where you plan to beach. Once boat is off trailer, maneuver your boat to your logs. Lift the bow and shimmy and pull until you feel your rig is secure without damaging it. On hard ground the logs might roll. So don't turn your back if you aren't tied off lol."
1067408,Sinker,2020-11-15 16:56:00,8692,Been doing it for 26 years with my boat. No problem. Starcraft aluminum. She's been beat on hard and still great! S.
1067426,LefroyFisherman,2020-11-15 22:35:00,602,"I wouldn't think just pulling it up to shore would damage the hull any, it's more the hidden logs and rocks when fishing lol"
1067594,b_cdot,2020-11-20 03:49:00,270,"I have a ranger with a black bottom. I pull it up on shore a lot. I have a hambys keel guard. With a keel guard I wouldn't be to scared of rocks. What I was impressed with was how many scratches¬†pulling up into bullrushes, wood,¬†and cattails puts on the fiberglass. My old lund had somewhat of an aluminum strake that acted like a keel guard. Pulled up gently on rocks and into bullrushes and wood. Definitely be prepared for some minor cosmetic damage."
1067635,floater,2020-11-21 10:41:00,220,I launched my 14 foot tinny by tying it to the trailer as well. But one time the knot slipped loose and off the boat went! Floated right past the photographer on the dock. I asked why he didn't grab it and he just shrugged! Had to swim out to get it in late October! I beach this boat all the time and it does have a few scratches on the hull but it's a tin garbage can. For the glass boat I have a keel guard. Easy to install and takes a beating
1067824,David Chong,2020-11-26 13:51:00,836,"With a glass boat a keel guard is a must and look for sandy/pebbly areas. Power Poles don't hurt either! Aluminum should be a issue, again avoid sharp jagged rocky areas. The TH Marine Z-Launch Cord is handy when launching solo! "
