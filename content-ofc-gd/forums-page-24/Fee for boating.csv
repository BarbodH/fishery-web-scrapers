1067550,410001661,2020-11-18 22:49:00,127,I agree welcome to Canada - beating you into submission one dollar at a time. This fee will go into the general coffers and nothing will change on the water.........idiots will be........err...... jet skiers!!
1067648,Cando,2020-11-21 22:45:00,90,Sure it does. that is BOB protecting his hidden stash ðŸ˜®

1067255,irishfield,2020-11-10 01:30:00,26272,Yep.. gotta be easier than laminated cards....
1067256,Terry,2020-11-10 01:41:00,14456,I think itâ€™s the registration they are talking aboutÂ making larger boatsÂ with smallÂ or noÂ motors get registration numbersÂ and they are talking about a fee every fewÂ Â years to re register
1067260,misfish,2020-11-10 10:30:00,29133,So your saying yaks and float boatsÂ  like mine ?
1067261,Terry,2020-11-10 10:34:00,14456,No I think it starts at 18 ft 
1067263,AKRISONER,2020-11-10 11:39:00,5558,Any way we can make it harder for jetÂ skiers to be on the water? Asking for a friend
1067269,irishfield,2020-11-10 16:17:00,26272,"Nobody is gonna like it, but surprised it's taken this long. I got pulled over with my fold a boat and 5Hp on a lake in Delta NY about 20 years back. I told the officer we didn't need registration numbers for anything under 10HP and he said ""you put an electric trolling motor on a dock and I'll bust you down here""! Thankfully he was interested in the boat construction and let me go.. without asking for a fishing licence..... Some vinyl numbersÂ and a sheet of paper from the laser printer..."
1067270,Garnet,2020-11-10 16:24:00,2056,Just a new revenue stream. Surprised it took this long.
1067271,Terry,2020-11-10 16:34:00,14456,"Next ,ATVs will need a sticker every year crap maybe I shouldnâ€™t post this it may give them ideas"
1067272,Fisherman,2020-11-10 16:44:00,7201,"If I have to get an ATV sticker, I will find you..."
1067276,Old Ironmaker,2020-11-10 19:50:00,8243,Just like when one of our crew was refused entryÂ at the border by U.S. Customs concerning an old Marijuana conviction and tried to explain to that U.S. Customs officer that he had been granted a Queens pardon for that old charge the American told the Canadian citizen as soon as America got themselves another Queen he would reconsider his decision.Â  Same goes for an Ontario law in New York State.
1067278,wkrp,2020-11-10 21:11:00,656,We are going have to put stickers on our foreheads pretty soon.
1067279,LeXXington,2020-11-10 21:12:00,1928,Now a boat drivers test i could support. Instead of parallel parking they test you at boat launching and retrieval 250hp or more special requirements and license to ensure your not an A $$. Jet ski owners must get a learners ticket first. Government finding more ways to make boating expensive.    
1067281,mukluk,2020-11-10 22:20:00,196,Better get use of this nit-picking way of making extra revenue.Â  Gonna see a lot of this asÂ soon as the government finds a cure for covie and starts to make up the billions of lost revenue spent.
1067282,misfish,2020-11-10 22:59:00,29133,He has connections. LOL
1067283,Fisherman,2020-11-10 23:36:00,7201,I know people with questionable backgrounds and bad habits.
1067284,irishfield,2020-11-10 23:43:00,26272,..and a laser printer...
1067302,pics,2020-11-11 13:55:00,1268,"To someone in government a ""reasonable"" fee is much higher than most of us would want to pay..."
1067314,AKRISONER,2020-11-11 20:52:00,5558,Id be ok with fees if they actually meant something. Thats the problem in my eyes. If higher fees actually meant less dangerous A holes on our waterways then there would be some substance to it.
1067322,Fisherman,2020-11-11 23:55:00,7201,I could live with a nominal fee of about $10Â  which would only needed to be renewed when the ownership changes.
1067345,DRIFTER_016,2020-11-13 05:04:00,10439,"Well up in my neck of the woods most people have never registered their boats at all. Plenty of big a$$ boats running around sans numbers here. No one cares. You are never asked to provide any paperwork. It's not like the feds will ever come looking for us miscreants up here. Fed: Sir I need to see your license Me: huh? License? I don't need no stinking license!!! Fed: Oh, you're getting a ticket it's $50 Me: Hmmmm, so you spent $11,000 flying around the arctic so you could give me a %50 ticket? That's just mint bye!!!  OH and something else strange has been going on. Ever since the gun ban was announced my sonar has been seeing this more and more. It's really weird. "
1067358,AKRISONER,2020-11-13 19:36:00,5558,one of those objects has absolutely nothing to do with a gun banÂ ðŸ˜†
1067360,LostAnotherOne,2020-11-13 21:24:00,956,Lol

Typical Liberal government Bull way to get more taxes. ""The proposed rule changes would provide the government with more information to identify the owners of recreational boats abandoned or wrecked in Canada's lakes, rivers and oceans."" Oh yeah, that is a major problem.Â  We all see thousands of abandoned and wrecked boats in our rivers and oceans.Â  Its a catastrophe!Â  This is going to play well with the big city lefties that will believe whatever they are told."
