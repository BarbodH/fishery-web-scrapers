1067868,misfish,2020-11-27 00:23:00,29133,Nice job Chris.  I know a young fella that bought lots of tickets to win one of those reels.
1067869,Dicorpof,2020-11-27 00:25:00,2,Beautiful
1067871,TJQ,2020-11-27 00:44:00,7806,Nice!!!
1067875,wkrp,2020-11-27 01:17:00,656,Amazing beautiful work. Canada Rocks!!
1067878,Bill,2020-11-27 02:07:00,140,Nice workmanship 
1067881,porkpie,2020-11-27 08:35:00,2521,"What you mean you don't make any rods to match those beautiful and stylish handcrafted in America Coleville precision reels LOL.  That handle needs more checkerboard burl!!  Seriously though, nice work!"
1067888,BillM,2020-11-27 17:58:00,17367,"Yup, those reels Ron puts out are on a whole other level.   I'd say the same thing about your builds, maybe one day I'll get you to re-wrao my IMX."
1068007,Dario,2020-12-01 21:49:00,4,"Hello Chris, If you wish you can double your luck all over again. Ron is building custom reel for me in the fall of 2021. So, it only make since if  you are the ONE who will build the custom rod for me. Just a hint. Nevertheless, I'm sure you will agree that Ron's reels and rods build by you are match made in haven."
1068042,misfish,2020-12-03 00:00:00,29133,Apparently the draw is tonight for one of Rons creations .. Son is crossing everything he owns in hopes to win. LOL
1068050,misfish,2020-12-03 10:20:00,29133,How much are horse shoes ???????????????????????
1068073,georginaisle,2020-12-03 22:03:00,42,Is that what you would call a center pin reel?
1068092,Spiel,2020-12-04 14:22:00,9065, Yes indeed.
1068095,PUMP KNOWS,2020-12-04 14:57:00,937,Beauty!!  How can I get my hands on the matching lemke hardware? Im looking to get my custom rod built this year but I think it’ll take awhile once it’s all completed.  I just placed an order for a cts blank 4-8 but who knows how long shipping will be from New Zealand. I received my reel last week and was eager to fish it.  Slapped it on my rpx and sent it.  First drift and fish on!
