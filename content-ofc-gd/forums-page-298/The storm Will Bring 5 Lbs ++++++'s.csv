794812,Fishing 24/7,2013-06-26 01:30:00,709,  you got that right but still . a 5.2 bass is a HELL OF A BASS  in my books. just a PURE TANK!
794860,Stoty,2013-06-26 11:01:00,2910,Beauty fish!!
794874,Rich,2013-06-26 12:58:00,3927,"Lol, I was gonna guess closer to 5 but when people started shootin the 7lb estimates I thought it would be an insult!"
795044,msp,2013-06-27 02:36:00,1336,nice bass !!!!!
795065,Barneybass,2013-06-27 04:05:00,14,Beauty fish!  That's the one thing i don't like about the new photography standards. Someone can make a small fish look big by holding it out to the camera and having upward angles. Lots of fishing shows do that now too especially with wide angle lenses and it's hard to really see how big. Back in the day most pictures were taken from afar and just normal holds.
795201,Fishing 24/7,2013-06-27 21:24:00,709,your right but when i go fishing i like to take pictures of the fish eveyone seen my face but this bass is unique so therefor im putting all the angles on it. i dont wanna show to much back ground and i sure dont want to show my face. its a fishing site and im showing a fish.  your going to tell me a 5.2 lbs bass is small ?  i dont care how far or how close its from the camera.  its a HOG! in every angle
795203,d_paluch,2013-06-27 21:27:00,343,"  ^this. But I don't think he was referring to this thread. I think he means in general its near impossible to get a true picture of a fishes size without some type of angle or pose these days. None the less I agree with what you say though. This is a fishing site, and I'd rather see more of the fish and less of the person (no offence guys  )"
795206,spinnerbaitking,2013-06-27 21:32:00,1622,A nickel is still a nice fish & always will be north of the Border Tight Lines SBK
795208,Roy,2013-06-27 21:39:00,13728,"5 or 7, that is a seriously nice fish. Thanks for sharing the pic."
