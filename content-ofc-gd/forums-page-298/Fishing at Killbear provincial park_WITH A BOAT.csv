I am going camping there in a week time and considering taking my boat. I've never fished in that area but according to Navionics depth charts, there might be some good spots for smallies. Anyone tried that area for bass? Any tips/spots? Much appreciated! Audio_mad"

795850,audio_mad,2013-07-01 03:45:00,28,"Wow, i didn't know that... What about other side: Patterson and around Mowai Island? Are they open for fishing? Is there any fish there?"
795853,d_paluch,2013-07-01 04:42:00,343,"I would check the regulations to be sure of what is open, as I do not know for sure. Someone more local might know more, I am sure they will chime in!"
