Thanks in advance!"
795195,fishindevil,2013-06-27 21:01:00,6254,Did you run into anything like hit bottom with the motor??? What is the make most props come off pretty easy ?? Might be seized up ?? Brushes ?? Are you sure your battery connections are good ?? Check all the obvious first
795196,fishindevil,2013-06-27 21:03:00,6254,The nut maybe on reverse like a fan blade try turning the nut the other way???
795202,CRAPPIE,2013-06-27 21:25:00,213,Thanks for reply  Battery is ok . Didn't hit anything at all. Turn nuts both ways but didn't work
795205,Fisherman,2013-06-27 21:31:00,7201,Is there a flat screwdriver slot in the end of the shaft by the wingnut?  Stick a screrwdriver in there while turning the wingnut.
795214,CRAPPIE,2013-06-27 22:01:00,213,Tried it already but still doesn't work . Do I need to turn the screw driver when turning the wing nut?
795236,aplumma,2013-06-27 22:39:00,6896,No the screw slot is to hold the shaft while turning the nut. Take a pair of needle nose pliers and put them tip first open them as wide as possible and turn the nut using them for leverage.   Art
