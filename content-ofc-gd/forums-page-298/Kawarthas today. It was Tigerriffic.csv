Only fished a few hours and boated 19 bass, 6 pike and a 44-46"" tiger muskie. 90% of the action was from 5:15-7:30  Didn't get any good pictures or any girth measurements, but it was a fat tiger. my boat seat is 16"" wide and it fills a little over half of the seat.   A video of the release.  http://s787.photobucket.com/user/nlpaintballer/media/Video002_zpsb1a417e9.mp4.html "

795031,Sinker,2013-06-27 01:40:00,8692,"That's one pretty, fat fish!! Beauty!  S."
795033,bobogo,2013-06-27 01:47:00,76,"wow. what a nice fish! the colours on it are so vibrant. i notice your pod packs, you storage lures in there?"
795040,chris.brock,2013-06-27 02:23:00,4053,"the video showed how big that tiger really was, the pics didn't do it justice, beauty!  it seems like a lot of tigers are coming out of the Kawarthas now, I'm guessing it's more common when  pike recently invade previous muskie  only waters???  edit  I don't know why my stuff is underlined, frustrating"
795041,msp,2013-06-27 02:24:00,1336,Thatsure is a fatty. well done
795046,nlpaintballer,2013-06-27 02:39:00,122,"Thanks guys, I wish I had a good pic of it, I would say it weighed between 25-30 pounds easily. It was nice and thick.  Bobogo, yeah I use my pods as extra storage for my oversize muskie lures. I work weekends now so tournament paintball is on hiatus.  I wonder if it was the same fish I caught 3 years ago when it was 43"" Same lure, same weather conditions and about 0.5 km apart. If not, that is a crazy population of natural tigers."
795073,fishindevil,2013-06-27 07:59:00,6254,Wow !!!! Nice lookin tiger for sure !!!!!! There seems to be more and more of them ..... Good for you and the guys that catch them .... But not good for the muskies they are being taken over .... Cheers on that fish tho .....
