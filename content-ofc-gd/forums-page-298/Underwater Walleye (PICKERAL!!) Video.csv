Amazing how aggressive these fish are there... too bad it didn't grab the hook, but was very interesting in the white grub... So is this fish a pickeral or a walleye?? "
794884,BillM,2013-06-26 14:24:00,17367,"TJ, I think it's pretty easy to confirm that this is in fact an Atlantic."
794886,Roy,2013-06-26 14:30:00,13728,Yeah and even the spot is recognizable. You should have at least 'shopped' the background.
794890,mike rousseau,2013-06-26 14:47:00,4661,"Very cool...  Walleye are preditors  like many other species.. And when they're ""active"" they attack with everything they've got..."
