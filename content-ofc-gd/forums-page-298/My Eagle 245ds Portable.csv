I use this as a second fish finder hooked up to a 7ah gell battery,or on it's own in a canoe or whatever. Anyone know why the clear screen of before is gone and now this? In Simulation mode the screen appears normal showing bottom ,fish,structure etc. I'm wondering if my transducer is gone or something else?. TIA. "
