I've never been a big fan of trolling and have always had a preconceived notion that down-rigging is incredibly boring. I couldn't have been more wrong!  We fished from about 5:30 AM until 1:30 PM and the action never stopped. My girlfriend caught her first fish ever. A 25 lb chinook with an attitude problem! Watching her battle this fish for the 15 minutes that it took to land it was worth the trip alone! My first was 18 lbs and my biggest, the biggest of the day, was 27 lbs.  I can honestly say that fighting a 25 lb chinook is simply insane! Never before have I experienced such fresh water ferocity and aggression. We boated 15 in total and lost more than I could count. I look forward to doing it again!"
