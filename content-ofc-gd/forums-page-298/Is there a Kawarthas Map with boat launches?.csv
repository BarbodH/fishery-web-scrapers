794773,Raycaster,2013-06-25 22:45:00,528,As a new boat owner I was wondering if there is such a map?  I have a beautiful laminated map of the area but one with boat launches marked would be really handy. 
794779,Guest MusicCityAngler,2013-06-25 23:42:00,0,"Backroads Mapbooks  puts out books that have maps of most of the lakes in different areas.  I have the one for zone 15, and have found it very helpful.  I think you would want zone 18.  They are on sale in many of the stores around here, but you could google them."
