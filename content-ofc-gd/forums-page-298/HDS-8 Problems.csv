795714,bucktail,2013-06-30 16:03:00,1857,After installing the latest update software patch from lowrance my HDS- 2 Gen 2 started acting wierd but eventualy settled down but still had a bunch of keys that were not working. I went out yesterday to do some keymapping and it wont boot at all!!! I have tried the soft and hard boot with no success.    1 other thing. Before I dd this I took out my radio so I thought I might have pulled a wire so I checked for voltage. It has 12.2 volts at the plug to the body of the unit.  Question 1  Does the yellow accesorie wire that with the power and ground have t be attached to power. As of now it is not. That is the only thing I can thik of.    That or the software update screwed the machine.  Any help would be appreciated!   Thanks  Darren
