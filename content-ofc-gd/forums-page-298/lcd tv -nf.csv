795812,livinisfishin,2013-07-01 00:05:00,661,Hi I have an lcd tv with 4 black lines running vertically on the screen. Im trying to figure out if there is a way to minimize these lines. There is one really dark one that if it was gone would make a world of difference. Ive looked on google and found out that the older tube models were able to be degaussed but with lcd this is not the case.  Thanks Jason
