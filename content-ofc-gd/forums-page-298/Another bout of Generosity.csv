Brought the canoe, and rigged with a bunch of rods ready to goLo and behold I bring everything, Minus my tackle bag. Had 4 hooks tied and 4 pieces of plastic in total.Luckily a downtown bass member fishing a tournament was pulling out, and gave me a couple packs of worms. For the rest of the afternoon we beat on a few 1-2lb largies with his worms.Thanks so much to this man with a triton - I owe you a beer some day. Pictures aren't with me and I'll post when I get them. They're nothin special, but my day was saved."

795078,wormdunker,2013-06-27 10:45:00,1711,"Proves there r still good people around.  I have a similar story.  2 years ago I was fishing Nipissing, doing really well catching nice sized perch & walleye thru the ice.  At the end of the day i'm packing up my gear, I have extra minnows.  So i take the minnows over to another group & offer them to the people.  The following week end I hit the same spot, Fishing is even better than the previous week.  Early afternoon I'm running low on minnows.  1 of the members of the group comes over to see how I'm doing.  I said great, but I'm really low on minnows.  He runs over to his spot & returns with a container of minnows!  In turn when I departed I stopped & gave then some perch & wallys. ""What goes around, comes around""!!"
