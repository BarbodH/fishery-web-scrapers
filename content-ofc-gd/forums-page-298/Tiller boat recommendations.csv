795683,bigcreekdad,2013-06-30 12:42:00,546,"I've been thinking about trading my Alumacraft Magnum 165 on a new boat. It's been a great boat for the 15 or so years that I've had it, but I'd like to get something new, and maybe a foot longer and a tad wider. This will likely be my last boat, as I am now officially a senior citizen. I will keep my Yamaha 60jhp 4 stroke as it is only 3 years old.  I've done a ton of internet looking at all the usual suspects (Lund, Aluma, Crestliner, Lowes etc), but was looking for some user recommendations.  I primarily fish the French River 304 trips a year, as well as some Michigan inland lakes.  Thanks in advance."
795684,kickingfrog,2013-06-30 12:50:00,8333,304 trips a year. You are my king.   I'll assume 3-4 trips.  No reason you have to leave Alumacraft. They have some great tiller layouts. It really comes down to what features you want on your boat and which brand that matches you and your fishing the best.  Good luck and show us the photos.
795687,bigcreekdad,2013-06-30 13:12:00,546,OOPS....yeah 3-4.  Don't I wish.
795688,mike rousseau,2013-06-30 13:15:00,4661,My cousin just got a Lund pro guide 1825 with 90hp merc...   Amazing boat...  Might be a bit bigger then what your looking at... But I believe they have a 17 foot model as well....
795698,Sinker,2013-06-30 14:35:00,8692,"IMO alumacraft has the nicest tiller layouts going right now. Great boats.  The lunds are great too, but their tiller layouts aren't as well thought out, and I'm finding the fit and finish on them is slacking.  S."

795721,Bondar,2013-06-30 17:12:00,817,Alumacraft + 1
