795309,Christopheraaron,2013-06-28 02:57:00,3525,"I guess this week is homemade outrigger week LOL, here's mine that I finished today, you cannot force this thing to flip.    If anyone wants to know how to make it PM me."
795310,Christopheraaron,2013-06-28 03:02:00,3525," LOL, is your buddy riding on the yolk?"
795312,Frank,2013-06-28 03:09:00,74,"  LOL, he is sitting on the bottom of the canoe, I put a piece of foam pipe covering on the cross member of the outrigger so he can lean on the outrigger comfortably, the yoke is untouched by him and the outrigger.  Great job on your outrigger!! I considered purchasing those boat bumper floats from Canadian Tire but clearly had a brain fart as to how to mount them, kudos to you and you're design, I love it!"
795313,Christopheraaron,2013-06-28 03:13:00,3525,Thanks! I'll have to steal your idea on the extra seat as well
795317,chris.brock,2013-06-28 03:54:00,4053,"that's a sweet canoe Christopher, Swift or Souris River?, the purists would be gritting their teeth looking at your mods to such a great boat though (Haha)"
795342,Christopheraaron,2013-06-28 11:30:00,3525,"Lol, it would be a swift. Carbon/Kevlar keewaydin"
795355,Broker,2013-06-28 13:36:00,482,"Those are some really nice stabilizers, I want to keep mine as low budget as possible so I would use pool noodle,I'm just unsure how to clamp them on without drilling holes into the canoe. Frank could you explain how to put those clamps on ? I'm slightly confused LOL"
795362,Tim Mills,2013-06-28 14:15:00,476,Impressive designs?  I met a guy at mountsberg last week that could have used outriggers.  He fell out of his sports pal last fall. Did not capsize but fell out had to swim and tow the boat in.  Said he sold the sports pal shortly thereafter.
795363,Tim Mills,2013-06-28 14:16:00,476,? In by mistake on previous post typo
795364,davey buoy,2013-06-28 14:26:00,5505,"These are great ideas!,for a narrow river could be a problem?. Now to tow behind your boat if you have extra anglers and not enough fishing room on board. Also these could be really helpfull with a slight chop or with a lot of boat traffic in the area.  ."
795385,Frank,2013-06-28 15:38:00,74," The u bolt strut beam claps look like this....    The lip of the clamp tightens with two nuts to the horizontal PVC cross member that goes across the canoe, my canoe has a lip/edge that goes to the outside of the boat, you just slide them up to the lip with the pole through the middle and tighten with a small adjustable wrench, they take 1 minute to put on and you do not need to drill through your canoe. If your canoe has a lip/edge on the inside like some do, then you just flip the ubolt clamp upside down, it works either way, I ordered mine through brofasco fastners in St Catharines and the two came out to $11.43 taxes in.  Cheap and useful!"
795657,adolson,2013-06-30 04:16:00,783,"I use a Lowrance X-4 Portable sonar, which I picked up at Canadian Tire last year when it was on sale. I don't really use it often, but I like it. It does what I need - depth, basic structure, and surface temperature. I believe you can get some kind of adaptor to clamp the transducer to your trolling motor (couldn't be too hard to make one, either), but I just use the suction cup that came with it, though I took it off the plastic piece and bolted the transducer directly to the cup, and I just stick it on the side of my Sportspal. It's not angled entirely correct when I do this, but whatever, it works well enough. Some day I'll rig up a better mount with a proper angle. It's not fancy, but I'm happy with it, and it's way better than the first sonar I had."
795682,ravinerat,2013-06-30 12:04:00,64,Can you show a better pic of your motor mount? I had a motor on my old Mad River canoe. I have a new canoe and looking at different ways to mount a trolling motor. My canoe used to motor right along with the trolling motor.   RR
795762,Broker,2013-06-30 20:49:00,482,"I just used scrap wood from a deck project.. Then used c-clamps to keep the mount on to the gunnels. Bolted a thicker piece of wood to mount the actual motor on. Works great, no problems, cost me 0 dollars all stuff I had around the house.   http://i1135.photobucket.com/albums/m639/Ratz2/null.jpg"
795768,irishfield,2013-06-30 21:02:00,26272,"  Exactly Chris! Great design, but why the need. I have never flipped a canoe unless I wanted to do so. Not even during the fight to get Kristal's 44.5 x 17 Northern in the boat."
795854,adolson,2013-07-01 05:44:00,783,"I've also never flipped a boat of any kind, yet I've considered adding these for the security/peace of mind when standing (for example, when learning to fly cast), and also for windier days on larger lakes.. But then again, I use a Sportspal, and that alone excludes me from any elitist crowd."
795856,Christopheraaron,2013-07-01 05:58:00,3525,"I did it to stand and fish, I could do so without them but I was always worried if flipping or just falling if the boat was really rocking."
795887,BLOO KANOO,2013-07-01 13:16:00,20,"You are going to have fun with that Shasta. I have a 36 lb thrust trolling motor and it will zip along pretty good. You might want to buy a tube to pull around behind you!  Thanks for posting your pictures Christopher, I had a design in my head but was trying to figure out something for the floats. Thats looks great."
794963,Broker,2013-06-26 22:14:00,482,"Hey, so as some of you may know I have been working to get a small fish able boat this year to get into the lakes with and a creek nearby aswell. I've had the canoe for almost a month and I've been waiting to buy a trolling motor. I made a motor mount for it that's been sitting around waiting for when they go on sale, and today was the day! $95! So off I went and picked it up, I think a fish finder will be next! Any suggestions?"
794980,Ralph Field,2013-06-26 23:17:00,1018,"Looks good! Don't forget that you will now need an operator's card , if you don't have one."
794986,Shloim,2013-06-26 23:34:00,515,Looks great I fish from a canoe as well. I have a similair setup and love it. Ive aldo added outriggers that stanilize it enough to stand and move around even land fish! Dont know how to post pics or i would...
794990,Christopheraaron,2013-06-26 23:52:00,3525,I don't believe he needs anything for a trolling motor...
794995,trevy727,2013-06-27 00:07:00,351, All operators of powered watercraft used for recreational purposes within Canada require the card as of September 15 2009.
794998,d_paluch,2013-06-27 00:20:00,343,"This  I thought it was weird too, but its law. Get it just to be safe!"
794999,redpearl99,2013-06-27 00:22:00,259,"he needs an operators card.  Btw, the cards are on sale on Groupon"
795014,Freshtrax,2013-06-27 01:03:00,2215,I got that ticket... Yes you do.
795034,Broker,2013-06-27 01:49:00,482,No worries fellas I already have the card! You can actually get some speed going too when your alone in the canoe haha.
795051,Christopheraaron,2013-06-27 02:54:00,3525,"Good to know, thanks for the heads up!"
795070,Freshtrax,2013-06-27 04:37:00,2215,I have a 36 lb on my canoe and when you click it into high gear it really flys
795105,wkimwes,2013-06-27 13:37:00,76,"Yes definitely you have to have an operators card, luckily before I went on my trip to the cottage last year..I double checked to see if a trolling motor requires an operator card.  Sure enough it did!  Only 3 days left to spare, I stayed up late and studied and did the course as quick as I could and passed the last day.  The one thing I'd like to ask, without some kind of stabilizer on standard canoes (no flat back), won't that cause a lot of instability while trolling around?"
795107,BillM,2013-06-27 14:02:00,17367,"I'd get some outriggers for that thing. I hate side brackets on canoes, lol."
795111,Broker,2013-06-27 14:17:00,482,"Personally I didn't notice the difference with the motor on it or off, however my canoe is more stable than others usually are. If I do end up finding it unstable I would look into outriggers, but I have no idea how to go about making those."
795128,Christopheraaron,2013-06-27 15:07:00,3525,"I'm making some today actually, the ones in store are like $400   I'll post some pics once they're done."
795132,Broker,2013-06-27 15:40:00,482,Okay Chris! Want something that is easily taken off / put back on for transportation
795134,bare foot wader,2013-06-27 15:52:00,1354,"home depot and some Canadian tires sell square aluminum tubing, some hardware, c-clamps and buoys from the marine section and you're in business for about 100 bucks  when I was a kid I used a few c-lamps, broken hockey sticks and those 5L refillable water bottles, lot of duct tape...worked but wasn't very pretty   just curious, I don't see the beer holder, errr, I mean the Gatorade holder...."
795140,Broker,2013-06-27 16:08:00,482,"They're there, right beside the seats"
795166,wkimwes,2013-06-27 18:38:00,76,"Thats what I'd be interested in too.  I have a canoe that I don't want to have something ""permanently"" attached."
795168,wkimwes,2013-06-27 18:40:00,76,"Yeah my canoe kind of sucks stability wise, especially when a 2nd person is in it..even though it is rated for it.  I've been thinking of how to put outriggers on it so I can stand in it, but I'm not ""very"" handy.  lol Plus like you stated, I'd like one that would be easily removed for transportation."
795172,Broker,2013-06-27 19:00:00,482,"Yeah I need easily removable because most of my transportation is done by carrying or hauling the canoe on trail to different spot on the river nearby, anyone have any suggestions on fish finders?"
795187,Shloim,2013-06-27 20:26:00,515,I have pics of my outriggers.  Just better at building those than posting pics... How do i post pics?
795198,Broker,2013-06-27 21:14:00,482,"If you make a photobucket account, then upload your pictures there, then when you want to post a picture copy the direct link on photobucket and insert into into the image drop down. Then your done! Hope that helps!"
795199,davey buoy,2013-06-27 21:21:00,5505,"I have a 15'6"" gruman and added a 30 minnkota endura to it.Balance didn't seem to be a issue,but went pretty good down the river at full speed  .lol. I used unistrut and a piece of wood where the motor hooks on.Enough room beside it to put my portable Eagle fish easy.What a blast."
795303,Frank,2013-06-28 02:34:00,74,"I JUST finished building my outriggers for my canoe yesterday, and took it out for a test and tune, it worked perfect!! I fit myself and two friends in the canoe and we all brought a pole and some lures, test and tune and some fish caught was a great two hour test drive for my canoe training wheels lol..  My outriggers break down into 3 pieces so they are able to be transported easily and I am able to adjust the floats vertically and to mount it to my canoe I used 2 ""U-Bolt Strut Beam Clamps"" this way I do not need to drill anything into my canoe, the beam claps tighten the cross member of the outrigger just using the inner or outer lip of the canoe. I did not want to use pool noodles or anything, I wanted to use old floats or something, but I was going nuts looking for something cheap, therefore went with jumbo pool noodles yesterday to get it out and they worked great!  Anyways, here are a couple pictures of my home made PVC, fully adjustable canoe outriggers.        Next is a trolling motor and portable fish finder for me lol"
