Most of the action was on Mitchell, but it was a nice day exploring areas that I hadn't been to before.  Ended up boating only 3 pike, a handful of bass and this little tiger.  Extended arms.  He did a nice little tail walk, too bad he was tiny."
794227,ccmtcanada,2013-06-23 23:00:00,7971,I could be wrong but I think that is a tiger Muskie or juvenile Muskie....maybe someone can clarify.  Great catch!!
794228,kickingfrog,2013-06-23 23:01:00,8333,Very cool colour pattern on that one.
794252,Joey,2013-06-24 00:03:00,9122," He says it is a Tiger Cliff, can't you read   Nice little tiger there!!!"
794266,Rizzo,2013-06-24 00:27:00,4754,gorgeous fish! Probably the best looking fish I ever caught was a similar sized tiger. Was out fishing with Aaron (CoolB) if anyone remembers him. Which lake did you get the tiger on?
794277,ccmtcanada,2013-06-24 01:08:00,7971,Apparently not! Lol  Carry on!
794441,nlpaintballer,2013-06-24 17:19:00,122,"Rizzo, it was caught in Mitchell lake. It was number 7 for me in the past 3 years, all from Mitchell, with the biggest being 43"""
794552,Skud,2013-06-24 23:49:00,739,Wicked cool lookiing fish!
794553,RickOnt,2013-06-24 23:52:00,669,That 'Tiger' is amazing!!
794554,Terry,2013-06-24 23:52:00,14456,nice looking tiger
794654,ehg,2013-06-25 11:16:00,2666,"Maybe the only good thing about pike entering Balsam,  Mitchell, etc... is the chance of catching a Tiger musky. That is a gorgeous fish. Cool to see a picture of 43 incher you caught.      I remember that fish and (CoolB) from one of those Niagara R. G2G'ers i think. Must had been a decade ago....time flies."
794752,nlpaintballer,2013-06-25 20:57:00,122,"This is the 43"" it was a very angry fish and I was solo.  and another small one. "
794865,ehg,2013-06-26 11:39:00,2666,That 43' er is a tank.  Thanks for posting pic.
795066,Barneybass,2013-06-27 04:09:00,14,"I love the look of the Tigers! just beautiful. I caught one about 45"" on Balsam a few years ago but didn't get a good picture becasue we lost the fish after it flipped out of the cradle boatside. Just have a picture with it in the water while I was fighting it."
795155,Jds63,2013-06-27 17:38:00,1365,"great report, amazing looking pattern"
795164,fishnsled,2013-06-27 18:23:00,3520," You really should try using Google.       ....sorry, could not resist.  Rounded tail and fins are a pretty good indicator.....along with the tiger pattern on the cheeks and sides.  Similar to this one.     "
795225,muskymatt,2013-06-27 22:25:00,2608,Nice fish but not good news for the Kawarthas Muskie population!
