This little piggie hit a spinnerbait in 4 fow on Opening day.        This morning in the drizzle they were taking topwaters eagerly        The sun came out and they became a bit harder to make eat, but we found some that were willing, Rattlebaits and Spinnerbaits burned fast were the lure of choice!
