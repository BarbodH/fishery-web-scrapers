795281,HyperActive,2013-06-28 01:02:00,56,"Hello all,  I am hoping to get some recommendations to take the kids camping next week.  We are looking for:  Shade, peace and quite awesome swimming/nice sandy beach, at worst, easy shore fishing for the kids at best decent bass fishing for all of us.  I would like to keep the drive under 4 hours any direction from Hamilton.  Thank you,"
795284,leaf4,2013-06-28 01:12:00,2466,"Grundy lake is a very nice provincial park right at your 4 hour mark, if you don't speed that is..."
795288,Broker,2013-06-28 01:28:00,482,Long point Provincial park has a fantastic beach. Nice shore fishing for perch (send me a pm)  at a certain area and great bass fishing in a boat
795291,Ron,2013-06-28 01:35:00,1683,Emily Provincial Park. Very south end of Pigeon lake. it's got everything you asked for. Kids can even jump off highway bridge. Muskie can be caught there too.
795315,chris.brock,2013-06-28 03:42:00,4053,"I would say head into Algonquin on the highway 60 corridor, Rock Lake, Cannis Bay etc, it's got a pretty good vibe in there, in the evenings there's always stuff going on the kids might get a kick out of, live music and theatricals at outdoor amphitheaters  it's a pretty cool Ontario experience, within 4 hours of the Hammer  you can also buy a cool Algonquin T-shirt, nobody will know that you didn't do any back country camping/ portaging"

795357,woodenboater,2013-06-28 13:39:00,2277,I'd also look at Arrowhead PP. Bit closer than Algonquin and very close to Huntsville if the kids get bored or need a Kawartha Dairy fix   Have skied and snowshoed there and but never camped there but would think it'd be more peaceful than some campgrounds in Algonquin (Rock would not be my first choice for peace and quiet although the beach and water access are great).  This Arrowhead photo gallery should give you a good idea of what some of the park looks like although I have no idea why there aren't any photos of the tent sites.  http://www.parkreports.com/gallery/gallery.php?park=Arrowhead
795358,fishindevil,2013-06-28 13:46:00,6254,good luck trying to find a pp this close to your timeframe that isnt already booked solid??? lots have been booked for months
795366,Musky or Specks,2013-06-28 14:37:00,2710,This it really bugs me that people book them solid and then never show up.
795500,HyperActive,2013-06-29 01:09:00,56,"Thank you for all the suggestions,  I think I am going to go with Ron's suggestion for now and try Emily.  I can't find the page I was on last night but there was about 8 sites left.  Thnx again,"
795793,pics,2013-06-30 22:56:00,1268,Emily is a nice park... You might even be able to rent a canoe to get deep into the weeds for bass...
