795261,bare foot wader,2013-06-27 23:42:00,1354,"this thread ties into the thread a week ago about insuring your tackle...I always have some tackle/gear in the truck on a permanent basis, just don't leave anything in plain sight and if you have a canopy, make sure it is always locked"
794238,jedimaster,2013-06-23 23:21:00,3472,Just a quick one. I never used to but this year I started leaving a rod and small tackle box in the car for emergencies. Have used it 3 times this year but now fish to speak of.
794241,muskymatt,2013-06-23 23:23:00,2608,Yes. All the time. Almost all summer.
794243,kickingfrog,2013-06-23 23:26:00,8333,Unfortunately (and fortunately) my life is fairly structured so a fishing trip needs to be somewhat planned in advance. So that's a no for me.
794244,davey buoy,2013-06-23 23:27:00,5505,Myself as well. Never know when a short day comes along. More so in the fall though.
794246,ccmtcanada,2013-06-23 23:30:00,7971,Yep.  I do...it more about being lazy than anything else!
794264,woodenboater,2013-06-24 00:26:00,2277,"in the ski box on the roof, locked and safe are a baitcaster and a box of cranks"
794271,dhickey,2013-06-24 00:39:00,1038,Yes absolutely hard or soft water. I keep it out of sight in soft water season but hard water I travel with my portable hut and all gear ready to go at the drop of a hat.
794276,Fisherman,2013-06-24 01:06:00,7201,"I figure getting up 5 minutes earlier to load the rods, reels, tacklebox and F/F is worth it compared to the major hassle if someone breaks into the vehicle and steals it."
794279,Dave Bailey,2013-06-24 01:18:00,1641,"Yep! I regularly get runs to places like Sudbury, North Bay, Huntsville, Perth, Kingston, Nephton, all with good fishing spots nearby. I've been to places all over southern and central Ontario, so I'm always ready."
794281,Lape0019,2013-06-24 01:28:00,647,I never have but it is probably because I don't have anywhere to keep it in the car ( my rods are all 1 piece).  My buddy used to keep gear there until someone stole about $1000.00 worth of gear out of it. He figured it was safe being locked in a car in a secure underground apartment garage. He quickly figured out he was wrong.
794285,jedimaster,2013-06-24 01:40:00,3472,I picked up a fairly cheap 6 piece rod with a box and reel. Made a small plano box with some cheap basics and it has come in handy this year.
794291,bigugli,2013-06-24 01:57:00,6138,"There is always a rod or two in the van along with tackle, nets , bucket, chair, coleman, raincoat, spare clothes, etc....   Never know where I end up at the drop of a hat."
794316,BillM,2013-06-24 03:28:00,17367,Nope never.
794326,tender52,2013-06-24 04:01:00,270,Always..... you never know
794341,wormdunker,2013-06-24 09:55:00,1711,
794350,ehg,2013-06-24 11:02:00,2666,Live in downtown T.O. That stuff would be stolen quick. So no way.
794354,bigugli,2013-06-24 11:14:00,6138,"Out here in farm country, too many know that I swing a mean axe."
794357,Tdel,2013-06-24 11:42:00,393,"No, I never leave tackle, rods or reels in car."
794358,Rich,2013-06-24 11:43:00,3927,"Ever since I got the inflatable, it's pretty much stuffed in the car with all my tackle all the time. Lol at very least though, there is always a baitcaster, a spinning rod and a couple tackle trays, just in case.  I've caught a lot of big, unexpected fish by simply stopping for 20 min and fishing on the way somewhere else.  I'm late for everything."
794364,spinnerbaitking,2013-06-24 12:13:00,1622,"I used to have a E-150 Ford Van for house painting with 4 sets of rod holders that held 4 rods each mounted to the Ceiling so at any given time my crew could go fishing for just about anything, when we were done early or a shower moved through we would hit the nearest river, lake or pond, Man I really miss that Van. Tight Lines SBK"
794401,Rod Caster,2013-06-24 15:10:00,5784,"My truck is too small. Between work gear and fishing gear, its a constant shuffle of gear."
794780,FloatnFly,2013-06-25 23:43:00,1640,"absolutely i do, at one point i had 3 spinning rods, a fly rod and float rod/reel in the back of my truck, locked tail gate with a tonneau cover comes in handy sometimes"
794786,crappieperchhunter,2013-06-26 00:06:00,2582,I voted no. However I do pack the car the night before if I'm getting up real early to head out fishing...but I didn't feel that really counted as leaving it in the car.
794861,Angler management,2013-06-26 11:02:00,280,"Thats awesome! I did the same thing with my pickup... I have 4 rods and a tacklebox ready to deploy at any given opportunity! I think i would feel like i was naked driving around without them now. Came in handy quite a few times over the past couple years. I keep all my receipts, and worst case scenario, insurance will pay to replace stolen equipment... I dont pay those f#Â£#% all that money for nothing!"
794953,Fish Farmer,2013-06-26 21:01:00,2234,"Did once, Put someone wanted my tackle more than me. Insurance wouldn't believe how much tackle cost. I laughed when she said, is it really worth it with $100.00 deductible. I told her 1 lure was $10.00 X's ?, 4 rigger rods,reels & 4 Elec. Big Jons  She WAS AMAZED."
