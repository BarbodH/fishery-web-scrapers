Well the house in Brooklin is sold BUT a home inspector said that either the master bathroom shower stall OR either of the two vanities is leaking to the kitchen.  It has never leaked before and I call Bull on the guy as the house has no flaws so he said the 2 nail pop's were water damage...  Either way in order to close I need to get a plumber to check those things out before I rip down drywall and start looking at things.  Anyone here (other than Art) a plumber looking for a quick side job?  If so please PM me ASAP before she calls someone else in and pays a huge price for nothing.  Thanks all!  PS, I'm not there to do any of the work myself and this is part of the reason I'm asking for help.  If I could check it out I would so I need a hand.  Cheers.  Geoff   "

795180,ketchenany,2013-06-27 19:48:00,3229,I''ve seen a leak in that area and two nail pops doesn't seem right to me. More like movement in the drywall. Probably an inspector wanting cookie points. Good luck Geoff.  A
