795830,moparhawk,2013-07-01 01:44:00,146,Excellent boat. I thought It very interesting you choose to rig it yourself. Its the smartest thing a guy could do. Congrats
794078,Dan668,2013-06-23 02:49:00,1120,"Sweet, I have the same rig but 2011, you'll love it."
794086,registerfly,2013-06-23 03:49:00,198,nice boat but where and when did the fence get there?
794091,glen,2013-06-23 04:39:00,2641,Fishing boat that you can't slime.  Lol.  It ain't that hard to clean off. Hey stop catching fish your getting my boat slimed.  Last time I was in a boat like that buddy broke me off.   Sucks cause it was a big pike with a kick butt lure.  What a numbnut.  Congrats she's a beauty.
794102,Terry,2013-06-23 09:17:00,14456,yes there  is a cover for it
794105,Handlebarz,2013-06-23 09:40:00,3790,I can hear the good Ol folding boat crying right now  great looking ride Terry Im looking forward to the reports coming from the trips out on her
794145,Terry,2013-06-23 14:59:00,14456,took it out for a spin no fishing just trying to get though the break in period ... dang 40 bucks in fuel in an hour and 15 minutes going 4000 to 5400 rpm hope it gets better once it spots using twice the oil
794147,misfish,2013-06-23 15:02:00,29133, Already complaining. LOL
794150,Terry,2013-06-23 15:05:00,14456,yeah but the wife didn't want to share the gas expense....good partner but not much of a fishing partner
794152,fishnsled,2013-06-23 15:07:00,3520,Sweet ride Terry!!!
794164,kickingfrog,2013-06-23 15:27:00,8333,Captain at the helm.
794169,muskymatt,2013-06-23 15:53:00,2608,Awesome rig! I'm sure many a fish will be hoisted over the gunnels in that one!
794177,aplumma,2013-06-23 17:46:00,6896,"Very nice rig Terry I am glad it also all came in. I am sure when the 9.9 gets in you will be made whole. I was once asked by a buddy as we drove to the boat what my truck got for mileage and I replied ""16 combined"" he said ""ouch"" I said ""meeh that not so bad the boat we are taking out get 1 1/2 MPG.""   Art"
794187,Terry,2013-06-23 19:18:00,14456,"lol  yeah, we know this,  the price you pay for toys....is just the start of what it will cost"
794189,misfish,2013-06-23 19:22:00,29133,Got those riggers on yet?
794191,Terry,2013-06-23 19:32:00,14456,"no I am missing a bracket, so I have not figured out how to put them on yet  I have the nylon being glued on as we speak"
794200,GBW,2013-06-23 20:32:00,8460,looks real good Terry.  But why are you glueing your nylons on?
794201,irishfield,2013-06-23 20:37:00,26272," Takes longer for the ""Johns"" to get them off and he gets paid by the hour...."
794203,Terry,2013-06-23 20:46:00,14456,"lol  lol  hang on I have one more in me   lol  funny stuff  it is a piece of nylon or some material like that glued on the transom, so no drilling into boat under the water line"
794255,Nipfisher,2013-06-24 00:08:00,2449,BOAT = Bust Out Another Thousand  Without gas in the boat she just looks good in the driveway.

I sold my 1625 Rebel and picked up my 1750 Tyee with 115hp and the 9.9 pro kicker a month ago,pretty much same boat as yours.I put two cannon mag 10s on it. Still haven't fully broken her in yet but I absolutely love this boat when I got it I was like a 6 year old on Christmas day. Enjoy! See you out there"
