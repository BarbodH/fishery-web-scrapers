795006,kickingfrog,2013-06-27 00:46:00,8333,Hard to beat Europe for great little towns and buildings.
795015,FrankTheRabbit,2013-06-27 01:07:00,479,Always enjoyed your pics and vids. Thx for sharing.
795023,Old Man,2013-06-27 01:19:00,822,Looks like a great trip Simon. I love France. Spent quite a bit of time around Reims myself and enjoyed every minute.  I hear southern France is even nicer. I really need to go back again.
795027,danc,2013-06-27 01:29:00,4677,Well no wonder I didn't see you in Dryden. Looks like a great vacation Simon. Life looks good for you!
795079,asdve23rveavwa,2013-06-27 11:01:00,2690,Some brilliant photos Simon. Looks like a beautiful spot to kick back and relax.
795080,mattyk,2013-06-27 11:04:00,2110,Great pictures!
795094,limeyangler,2013-06-27 12:21:00,5204,"Thanks Roy, it costs an arm and a leg now Jack is full fare on flights....but he needs to be there to see Gramma and Gramps.    LOL...we ate a lot of mussels!    Yup, history seething through every building it seems, our building has been around since the 1600s....it was an old nunnery to begin with, we have an old stone coffin we use as a flower pot that was unearthed on the grounds when they were ploughing the fields....the skeleton of the 400 year old nun disintegrated when the air hit it....COOOOL!    Thanks Frank.    LOL...i nearly ended up in Reims after taking a wrong turn coming off the ferry at Calais!    Thanks Dan....you know to give me a shout when you are here though right?    I can definitely sleep more than anywhere else when i'm there....a well needed rest!    Thanks Matt!"

795154,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-06-27 17:36:00,535,"Wow, is it ever gorgeous there! Must have been hard to leave but those walleye must have made it a little easier."
795158,fishnsled,2013-06-27 17:50:00,3520,"Fantastic shots Simon, beautiful place you've got on the other side of the ""pond"".  The architecture and food look amazing.  Those walleyes aren't so bad either."
