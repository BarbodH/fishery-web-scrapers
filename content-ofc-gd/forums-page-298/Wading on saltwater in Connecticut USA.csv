Two fish landed were around 1 lber, while the third one was roughly 3 lber. Location: Walnut beach, New Haven Connecticut. Saltwater shoreline fishing. Weather: calm sunny hot day, around 85 degrees, hardly any wind.  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/IMG_0003_zps65a2e258.jpg  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/IMG_0007_zps0acb24f1.jpg  two video: http://s223.photobucket.com/user/bassfighter_album/media/MVI_0005_zps5b2d947e.mp4.html  http://s223.photobucket.com/user/bassfighter_album/media/MVI_0002_zps7084540b.mp4.html  Water had receded by 7am when I got there, at first glance of the area was to my disappointment, sandy bottom and flat shoreline everywhere. I was not sure if I was able to even catch anything since there were no rocks, nor weeds, no corals, except sand everywhere, but lots of clams. Quite a few people were collecting buckets of clams for food. Water was flat, clean, and very calm and I was able to walk for half a Km out of the shore, before water reaches knee deep. I casted for half an hour, but was getting negative vibes, after viewing the sandy flat bottom around me, a very different experience compared to fishing our Kawarthas lake, when we normally would fish on weed beds.  When I notice my line started to move to my surprise, I made a comment to myself and said ""NO WAY!"" Another fish was also followed the fish I just caught(see video). Then the second fish came 20 minutes after, and the third bigger fish , all within 2 hrs of fishing. I called it quits since I left my wife at the motel and we have to check out to go somewhere else. The tide had also started to come in, I was concern, that I would not be able to get back to shore, since some areas I ventured  through have deeper drop off slope and sea water could fill it quite easily in no time.  I was also using my waders with a leak on it, not sure how the rubber mold had broke into two inch hole , it was somewhat uncomfortably fishing with full of water inside one of my legs, even if water was warm.  Based on this new discovered fishing experience, I would comment, it would be easier to fish on saltwater system. There seem to be more fish compared to fishing our over fish pressured lake system. The fun part of my fishing day was I was using artificial lure rather than having to use clam as bait."

Easily caught they are the carp/bluegill of the sea. lol    Cut and copied from WIKI   Sea robins, also known as gurnard, are bottom-feeding scorpaeniform fishes in the family Triglidae. They get their name from their large pectoral fins, which, when swimming, open and close like a bird's wings in flight. They are bottom dwelling fish, living at depths of up to 200 m (660 ft). Most species are around 30 to 40 cm (12 to 16 in) in length. They have an unusually solid skull, and many species also possess armored plates on the body. Another distinctive feature is the presence of a ""drumming muscle"" that makes sounds by beating against the swim bladder.[2] When caught, they make a croaking noise similar to a frog, which has given them theonomatopoetic name gurnard.[3] Sea robins have six spiny ""legs"", three on each side. These legs are actually flexible spines that were once part of the pectoral fin. Over time, the spines separated themselves from the rest of the fin, developing into feeler-like ""forelegs."" The pelvic fins have been thought to let the fish ""walk"" on the bottom, but are really used to stir up food. The first three rays of the pectoral fins are membrane free and used for chemoreception. Sea robins have sharp spines on their gill plates and dorsal fins that inject a mild poison, causing slight pain for two to three days. Sea robin flesh is described as firm and tender when cooked. The fish serves as an adequate replacement to rascasse, or scorpionfish, in bouillabaisse, though it can also be used with scorpionfish. Sea robins can be caught by dropping a variety of baits and lures to the seafloor, where they actively feed. Mackerel is believed to be the most efficient bait for catching sea robins, but bunker and other fish meat can also be used successfully depending on your specific location. Sea robins can also be caught by lure fishing if lured near the substrate. They are often considered to be rough fish, caught when fishing for more desirable fish such as striped bass.   Art"
