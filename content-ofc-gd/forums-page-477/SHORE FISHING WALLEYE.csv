Nothing fancy, jigs and large minnows cast into 18' of water and brought back with a jerk..jerk...twitch twitch...pause (repeat). This outing the fish were doing a late shift and took 20 minutes before biting, but for 1 hour it was again a bite a cast and i was home in time to cook it up.   <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/JZTPqGw_Bh8"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>     "
