This is my first Baitcast setup, I'm liking the left hand retrieve. I cast and troll for Bass and Northerns, and Musky. Question #1 Does anyone or has anyone used this reel before. Question #2 In my case, should I still try to find heavier gear? Question #3 Can I be a man AND use left hand retrieve?   Lol Thanks in advance"
