Fish are plentiful and hungry once the water cools, and can generally be found in specific and easy-to-find places. Mid-October also signifies my return to our northern province – to sample the French bass in all their Quebec glory. My buddy Andy’s small cottage lake never fails to impress.  October 17  Mother Nature rolled out of bed on the wrong side this day – and she showed a demeanor that was in sharp contrast to the glorious weather of only a week earlier. Needing to head up to the cottage this morning, I decided to tag along with Andy and get in a few hours of fish time in preparation of our day-long outing planned for the next day.
