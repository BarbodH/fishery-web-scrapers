631838,Joey,2011-10-18 12:08:00,9122,"Looks great Lew, a morning rainbow.  Hopefully that is the end of the rain for awhile"
631843,oldphart,2011-10-18 12:16:00,665,"~~~Yes another great day in down town Tarona,(TO to you out siders) Police chopper hovering over head, protesters camping out in the park a block away, Union Station jammed with Police waiting"
631845,lew,2011-10-18 12:22:00,12766, I guess my mornings going better than yours...
631850,woodenboater,2011-10-18 12:55:00,2277,"hey oldphart,  were they drumming late into the night ? heard the noise was a major issue for those living in close vicinity. got ear plugs if ya need them  I think it'll peter out as it doesn't seem like the occupy community in toronto is cohesive (can't decide on what they wanna do and in fact splinter off into separate protests)  and lew, that is a killer rainbow to wake up to !"
