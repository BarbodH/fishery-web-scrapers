It's been a great truck, but it's old and I'm getting killed on gas.  I'm looking into getting a colorado/canyon.  4x4 is a must; I really like the z71 models.  They have the inline 5 cyl. and a 4 cyl., not interested in the 8 cyl.  My boat is a 167 Princecraft pro with weight in total (including motor, battery etc.)  a max of 1100 pounds.  Would a 4 cyc. Colorado be able to tow my boat?  I'm really trying to limit my gas money - like everyone else.  Any advice would be appreciated.  Zeeter"

I wished I had the 4wd.  The 5 was fine on gas, but I was never able to get the advertised gas mileage, well under for that matter.  That was a fairly new engine in 2006 from what I remember, so maybe they have made in-roads in fuel consumption since then."

630999,scugpg,2011-10-14 23:53:00,1373,You should look at the escape in a 4x4. The 4 would pull that but the 6 would work much less. Barry is right they don't invest much technology into small trucks for power train and mileage

I just worked with a guy that had the colorado Z71 4 cylinder (its a big 4) He was very happy with it but did mention that a new full size would cost him about 60$ less per month?? Its year end time for the auto dealers so insentives will be sweet for those looking at a new truck. WORTH taking the time to check out.

As most have said, the four might leave you wanting more and the small truck V6/I5's are not great on gas.I wish they brought the australian/south american trucks our way.  I have the B4000 and get 600kms Max on a 70litre tank, 100 percent highway. Send me to latchford for some back roading and that cuts to 450.
