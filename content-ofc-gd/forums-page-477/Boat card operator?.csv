In order to continue next day you have to start again with module 1 and there is no way to skip where you left last time. And you have to spend at least 25 min in each module - time is counted. There is no way to skip the 25 min per module. Anyone has a better aproach for this cumbersome way? I prefer to study only, no need to buy anothr paper book.  Regards."
