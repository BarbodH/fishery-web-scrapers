632475,davey buoy,2011-10-19 21:59:00,5505,"That must be a joke lol.Who in there right mind would fish in those conditions? That's why steelhead fishing is better.Later into the fall/winter,temps to cold,nasty weather,rain,maybe snow.What else could a fellow ask for when river fishing?.Good fishing everyone."
