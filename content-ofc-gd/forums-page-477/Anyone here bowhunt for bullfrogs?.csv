631536,OutdoorDan,2011-10-17 02:48:00,325,"The weather forecast calling for somewhat choppy weather, I decided to go shore fishing in a small, secluded (from the wind) part of a river and got myself a few pike.  One of them swallowed my bait entirely, and I decided that gutting the fish to get it out would be easiest.  In the process, I noticed how bulky the stomach was -- so naturally I had to see what's in there and what the fish are eating.  That is when I pull out a half-digested frog - with the left leg completely intact and still attached to the skeleton.  This thing was huge!  It's thigh was the size of my thumb, and aside from the fact that it was covered in stomach acids looked extremely tasty.  Maybe the French did get something right after all?  So come on out, there's gotta be a few here - who's eaten these things?  Oh and mandatory picture below....  WARNING!  Could be gross to some...                                     "
631551,jedimaster,2011-10-17 03:56:00,3472,"I have had frog legs, its not too bad, like most people will say tastes like chicken."
631553,Roy,2011-10-17 04:16:00,13728,I like frog legs too. They don't really have much taste...most people just smother them in garlic butter anyway. The only thing I really don't like about having frog legs is sending the poor little buggers home in those little wheelchairs.
631555,craigdritchie,2011-10-17 06:00:00,1586,I had frog's legs when I was in France on vacation this year. Roy hit it - all I could taste was garlic butter.

631589,mike rousseau,2011-10-17 12:13:00,4661,It's like eating dull chicken wings...
631594,Bob,2011-10-17 12:29:00,370,"Used to hunt them years ago when I was a kid. Club them with a stick and throw them in the boat until you get enough for a meal. Wrap the legs in foil with butter, salt and pepper and roast them in the coals of your campfire. Yum.  Nothing like chicken. That one in the photo isn't really very big."
631596,Headhunter,2011-10-17 12:36:00,5703,"Dredge with flour, fry in butter with some salt and garlic... yummy. HH"

631644,OutdoorDan,2011-10-17 15:20:00,325,   I often hear them (I assume) but don't really see too many.  That leg looked huge to me!
631698,Joey,2011-10-17 18:44:00,9122,"I've had them, yup, tastes like chicken!"
631706,bassmaster4,2011-10-17 18:54:00,801,compared to the fish or from what i can see in the picture that pike had himself a big meal! Ill leave the frogs for the pike.
631711,OutdoorDan,2011-10-17 19:12:00,325,"Yeah it wasn't a big pike at all, you can see with the cheapo CT multitool beside it.  The frog's leg itself left a bulge in the stomach!  P.S. -- pike was tasty!"
631805,GoneFishin,2011-10-18 02:00:00,349,"Haven't eaten one, but I have yet to find a bullfrog that wont attack my frog when fishing lol. Maybe one time when I'm camping I'll keep a couple for the fire."
631836,Rizzo,2011-10-18 12:00:00,4754,"I've caught a couple on topwater baits, but they were all released, thought of eating it never entered my mind"
