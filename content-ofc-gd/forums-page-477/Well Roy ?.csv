632577,Roy,2011-10-20 10:40:00,13728,"Most of us still work even when it's cloudy and raining. Some of us even work when it's cold and when it's snowing. If you absolutely can't go out in the rain, why don't you modify one of those sleds you have for sale to hold Baby LaLa's box of toys and add a tow bar to make it easier for him to go play out on the ice?  How about sewing zippers to the bottoms of your pants pockets. It'd make it much easier to remove perch."
