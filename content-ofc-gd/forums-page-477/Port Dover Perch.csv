624776,Adam Delves,2011-09-25 15:02:00,28,Was hoping to head into Port Dover and fish off the pier. Any idea when would the perch might being coming back in?
624786,Billy Bob,2011-09-25 15:42:00,5865,"On the USA side of Erie we have been getting good catches at 50' and 70' so that tells me they are still out deep. However, I just dipped some bait from the Niagara River and there wasn't as many minnows as last week...took a while to get a bucket full....many guys were fishing off shore there but they weren't catching any fish....but another guy said he lost his dip net so I got him a bucket of bait....he said he was going to fish off shore at Wilson on Lake Ontario for perch.  Good Luck, Bob"
624795,Adam Delves,2011-09-25 16:45:00,28,"Thanks. Hope to catch some for a nice fall fish fry. I've ""baited"" my neighbor with the idea of fresh perch so I better come through."
624821,Adam Delves,2011-09-25 20:05:00,28,Anybody live in the Dover area or fish the pier often to have an idea when these tasty fish might return?
624839,northernpike56,2011-09-25 21:35:00,717,I honestly have no clure but I'd be curious as well
625305,Adam Delves,2011-09-27 12:18:00,28,Anybody have some thoughts here? As much as I'd like to have a fishing boat it's just not possible right now. Shore(pier) fishing is what's available and I'd sure like to be able catch something edible.
626583,Adam Delves,2011-09-30 19:34:00,28,Just putting this back to front as fresh. Any thoughts on the perch?
626589,Fish Farmer,2011-09-30 19:52:00,2234,"Can't tell, but give you a hint, it's in a bay on Erie and looks like a birthday cake. You have to sort through small ones. WE took home 75 last Sat. but you need a boat"
631877,Adam Delves,2011-10-18 13:55:00,28,Anyone fishing off the pier in Dover recently?
632213,Billy Bob,2011-10-19 09:39:00,5865, It's been about 3 weeks from your first post....WHY haven't you fished Dover and given a report
632340,Adam Delves,2011-10-19 15:24:00,28,"With three kids, two of whom want to fish (little guy is not yet two) it would be nice to hear from someone that it's worth the drive. I went a few weeks ago by myself and was the only guy standing on the pier with a rod.  Felt and looked pretty stupid. My oldest daughter says its more fun fishing when you're catching fish. I've had plenty of lone casting practice."
632362,smally21,2011-10-19 16:17:00,993,"they are all thru the bay at depths down to 5 feet, so they are in.  but they are catching them off port maitland in 60 feet, so they are out.  the perch hung around the north shore in limited quantities all summer it seemed.  8 out of 10 times you'll catch perch in port dover, but there is only a 50% chance of that."
