632193,Pangle,2011-10-19 03:08:00,64,"So, I picked up a centre pin from GBW on the weekend (btw it was nice meeting you and thanks) and got out to a trib today.  Needless to say casting is completely different from my usual spinning outfit.  It probably took a dozen or so casts to toss the float 20ft!  Compound the low and crystal clear conditions fishing was tough, but I was determined to learn.......The most obvious benefit of the pin is how you can keep most of the line off the water and still have a natural drift.  The second is the ""hand to hand"" battle with the fish. Anyway,  after spooking all the fish in each pool due to my less than stealthy casts, I worked my way down to a favourite hole.  This time I casted way upstream and drifted into the deeper hole.  Finally, success.......3 casts and 3 bows!  They were anything to brag about, but what a rush to see the float drop and then to palm the drag.  I now understand why so many guys use a pin!  I'm hooked. Thanks for reading.        "
632194,OutdoorDan,2011-10-19 03:15:00,325, That is definitely something to brag about!  Nice fish!
632200,skeeter,2011-10-19 03:32:00,1907,20 casts and you had the hang of it? Geoff had it for 20 months and couldnt figure out which end of the rod to hold!!!
632205,rocheleauc,2011-10-19 06:05:00,205,"awesome, thanks for sharing."
632219,Pangle,2011-10-19 10:40:00,64,"  Not quite.  I still need lots of practice!  However, I basically stood in the water at the top of the run and let it drift 20-30 yds."
632228,BCLT,2011-10-19 11:53:00,86,"pickin it up in 20 casts is great! I fish the same reel from Okuma, love it! three bows in three casts is remarkable - I must admit I backlashed several times while learning how to palm fish lol"
632263,BillM,2011-10-19 13:06:00,17367,"Good job man!!  Best advice I can give you is to not cast upstream from your standing position.  All you'll end up with is a bunch of slack line and a headache.  Either cast across from you, or slightly downstream..  Keep your rod up, the line off the water and hold on   You can also mend the line like you would when you're flyfishing (You don't want your line downstream of your float).."
632299,craigdritchie,2011-10-19 13:58:00,1586,"25 years for me, and I'm still getting the hang of it."
632307,GBW,2011-10-19 14:03:00,8460,"Wow, that's great Peter!  I'm VERY happy for you!!!  I knew it would get more use with you then with me.  Now to go get another one so we can get out fishing...   Hey now.  what are you still using?"
632349,Ralph Field,2011-10-19 15:44:00,1018,"I'm with Craig, I have yet to master it but love it anyways."
632395,Spiel,2011-10-19 17:48:00,9065, Or never will.   Nice going on your success Pangle!
632426,misfish,2011-10-19 18:59:00,29133,
632469,camillj,2011-10-19 21:37:00,1988,Heck .. I never knew you could cast with a pin !  
632474,davey buoy,2011-10-19 21:53:00,5505,"Nice catch,it only took me 4 trips to the river(lots of hours)and when a nice gentleman beside me offered me a suggestion or two,10 mins later I was casting across the river if I wanted,and caught a few fish since than.What a thrill to palm the reel without any mechanical help. Only wish I would of caught on to this earlier. Pangle,by the way same reel as I have.I love it. Oh,still have to work on my delivery,not the smoothest cast you'll see!"
632478,craigdritchie,2011-10-19 22:13:00,1586,I wondered how long that would take!
632494,misfish,2011-10-19 22:58:00,29133," Pretty much what happen to me Davey.  I,ll bet these guys wished they kept it under their hats."
632502,Twocoda,2011-10-19 23:26:00,4130,nice shottin Pangle....good on ya ..!!
632503,GBW,2011-10-19 23:30:00,8460,"PS, next time bring a few home for us to sit out back and smoke them over a beer!"
632533,Pangle,2011-10-20 00:41:00,64,Hey thanks everyone for the responses and Geoff I might take you up on your offer!   
632553,GBW,2011-10-20 02:31:00,8460,NICE!  Just let me know so I can get it all ready!
632624,FrankTheRabbit,2011-10-20 14:32:00,479,Nicely done! Now you can fish all season with a pin reel. You should try ice fishing with a CP reel.  It's quite fun I've heard!
