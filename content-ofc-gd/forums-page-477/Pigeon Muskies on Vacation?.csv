632074,captpierre,2011-10-18 22:32:00,2521,"Finally got out Sunday on Pigeon to catch a biggun.  Trolled 15-25 ft, 3-3.5 mph with a perch 10 inch Jake.  Not a sniff.  Water temp 58 on the surface.  2 ft waves with resulting murky water.  Thought they turned on after Thanksgiving.  Got tired of rockin and rollin so called it a day at 6pm."
632082,cram,2011-10-18 22:40:00,1733,"Was it murky because of the wind, or because it's turned over recently?  (though 58 is warm for turnover)."
632083,lew,2011-10-18 22:42:00,12766," You've gotta switch up the baits now & then, find out what their looking for.  Their in there, you just need to figure the pattern."
632172,mike rousseau,2011-10-19 02:07:00,4661,I'm still catching at 5mph or faster...  With musky you need to change it up...  Change speed... Color...depth...running depth... Lure profile...  The other day I was trolling for a couple hours... Kicked up the speed and in less then a minute I had hooked up a musky...  They are hard to pattern... But you need to experiment...
632186,Rizzo,2011-10-19 02:49:00,4754,I'm at Pigeon next week for 2 days so here's hoping water gets clear and the fish turn on!
632444,jimmer,2011-10-19 19:55:00,2730,Those things have been on vacation all year!
632666,ehg,2011-10-20 18:26:00,2666,"Sounds like you tried the right thing in the right place. Yes, full turnover usually occurs after Thanksgiving but was warm summer/fall probably delayed this.  At least now you can fish there till mid-December if you can handle freezing."
632667,DOS,2011-10-20 18:33:00,119,"Try a jointed beleiver in the natural walleye pattern, couple of customers have had good luck this year with them on Pigeon, including a 48 last sunday.  I am waiting for him to e-mail me the pic..."
