631124,mercman,2011-10-15 14:39:00,7054,Just bought a new Jeep Compass with 215/55R18 tires. I have winter tires with rims 215/65R16. Are these ok as winter replacements for my car?   Paul
631125,Skipper D,2011-10-15 14:47:00,1970,"  Paul . 55's are a wide tire , not good for winter , stay narrow in winter with lower numbers like 65 , 78 , 70 ."
631127,Skipper D,2011-10-15 14:50:00,1970,"  there is also a 100% chance the 16"" rim wont fit where the 18"" came off , 16""rim wont clear the brake calpier and rotors ."
631129,mercman,2011-10-15 14:53:00,7054,"perfect, thats what i needed to know. thanks Skipper"
631132,Skipper D,2011-10-15 14:56:00,1970,how you's liking the new Compass ?
631150,Tybo,2011-10-15 16:04:00,1373,55 is the profile of the tire.215 is the width.16 wheel size.
631155,mercman,2011-10-15 16:30:00,7054,"  Love it !!! We had a Caliber R/T that my wife called the ZoomZoom  The Compass has the same 2.4L Mitsubishi motor and tranny. We got the 2012 limited and it has everything in it I  love the heated leather seats and automatic climate control. Built in navigation, 30gig HD, DVD player,bluetooth, 9 speaker Boston aucoustics sound system Heated mirrors, auto nite adjusting rearview mirror, cruise control,tinted windows,auto/stick shifter,voice command electronics,and a few other things i cant remember"
631157,danbouck,2011-10-15 16:57:00,4380, This is correct
631158,danbouck,2011-10-15 16:57:00,4380,"The only problem you may have is that the brakes are to big for a 16"" rim"
631169,Tybo,2011-10-15 17:27:00,1373,"Strong chance since it's custom oem heep,That the oem stock size is 16's wheels."
631246,ecmilley,2011-10-15 22:37:00,2163,"the 215/65r16 is only 1.1% differance in diameter to the 18 inch size the 16 inch rim will work no problem unless the vehicle is equipped with the srt package,"
631247,mercman,2011-10-15 22:41:00,7054,"  Great news.Thanks for the info.The Caliber i traded in had 18 in rims, and these were the winter tires for that vehicule, so i am pretty sure they will fit on the Compass. Just wanted to be sure before installing them."
631502,skeeter,2011-10-17 00:56:00,1907,"Going from 18"" to 16"" will put your speedometer out of whack. The smaller rims will spin faster then the 18"", which will show a faster speed on the speedometer then you are actually going. On the brighter side, your wife wont get to many speeding tickets!"
631508,danbouck,2011-10-17 01:04:00,4380, Not if the tires are a larger diameter like in this case

631585,Billy Bob,2011-10-17 11:54:00,5865," Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that..."
631810,BillM,2011-10-18 02:24:00,17367,"  The 55 is the height of the sidewall, which is actually a percentage of the width.  So 55% of 215mms is the sidewall height (215 x 0.55 = 118.25mm)  It's got nothing to do with the width of the tire.  If the OP can find 16in rims that will fit, go for it."
631831,mercman,2011-10-18 11:25:00,7054,"  Thanks Bill, they are on 16in rims. They were the winter tires from my Dodge Caliber R/T,which also had 18in summer tires. 16in are so much cheaper than 18.  Paul"
