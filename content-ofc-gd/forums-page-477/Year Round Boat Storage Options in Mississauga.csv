632222,Wymen,2011-10-19 11:37:00,30,Hey there I'm planning on buying a boat next year and I'm looking for storage options.  I live in mississauaga so I was wondering what my options are?  I'm also interested in hearing how the rest of you city folks store all of your toys.   I want to get an atv or sled for the hard water season but storage is the common issue.  Wymen
