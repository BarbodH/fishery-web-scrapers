632607,Roy,2011-10-20 13:38:00,13728,"Yeah, Yeah...I know I can roast them on an open fire but these things are all over the place and I have a few pails full. I don't like wasting things and I don't see any recipes sounding too interesting. The only way I'm used to eating them is directly from the vendors in downtown Toronto when I was younger. Any hints? Thanks."
632617,dave524,2011-10-20 14:10:00,4508,I suspect the ones you have are not the edible kind but the Horse Chestnuts. We did have an edible chestnut but it is virtually wiped out due to a blight like the Elm Tree.  http://www.canadianchestnutcouncil.org/  edit: you have this one I'm guessing  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesculus_hippocastanum
632623,Roy,2011-10-20 14:31:00,13728,"Thanks Dave, I should have looked that up first. They certainly look like the horse chestnuts."
632626,dave524,2011-10-20 14:48:00,4508, They are not a native species but have been widely planted with a lot of older trees around in established neighbourhoods.

632645,ketchenany,2011-10-20 16:24:00,3229,"Roy, If you get some real chestnuts try this.  ROLLED VEAL STUFFED WITH CHESTNUTS   print  Liguria claims the most celebrated recipe for stuffed breast of veal, with a filling of veal, sweetbreads, pistachios, herbs, cheese, and hard-boiled eggs. In Lazio, cooks stuff the meat with a filling based on chestnuts, which have been grown in the region for centuries.  1 lb chestnuts 1 boneless breast of veal, about 2 lbs salt and freshly ground black pepper 5 or 6 slices prosciutto 1 egg 2 tablespoons fine dried bread crumbs about 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 clove garlic, quartered lengthwise 1 fresh rosemary sprig, broken into pieces 1 cup dry white wine  To start your Rolled Veal Stuffed with Chestnuts:   Using a paring knife, cut an X in the flat side of each chestnut.   Place the chestnuts in a saucepan, add water to cover, bring to a boil, and cook for 35 minutes.   Drain, rinse under cold water, and peel away the hard outer shell and thin, furry skin beneath it. Set aside.   Preheat oven to 500Å’ F.   Lay the veal breast on a work surface and season with salt and pepper. (Use salt sparingly, as prosciutto can be salty.)   Lay the prosciutto slices over the veal in a single layer. In a bowl, beat the egg until blended and season with salt and pepper.   Add the chestnuts and bread crumbs and stir to combine.   Place the mixture in the center of the veal breast, roll up the veal into a cylinder, and tie securely, including the ends, with kitchen string to hold the stuffing in place.   Pour about 1 tablespoon of the olive oil into the bottom of a shallow roasting pan.   Put the veal in the pan and season with salt and pepper.   Place the garlic and rosemary pieces along the top of the veal roll and then drizzle the remaining olive oil over the top.   Place in the oven and roast for 1 hour.   Remove the pan from the oven and pour the wine over the veal.   Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil, return to the oven, and cook until the meat is very tender when pierced with a knife, 10 to 15 minutes longer.   Remove from the oven and transfer the veal roll to a platter. Let rest in a warm place for 15 to 20 minutes.   Skim off the fat from the pan juices and discard.   Reheat the juices.   Cut the veal roll into slices 1/2 inch thick. Spoon the pan juices over the top and serve.  Yield: 4 servings"

Here's what you need Roy; -one cat -one vinyl floor -two chestnuts, split in two, seed removed  Place 1/2 piece of walnut shell on each foot. They should easily slip right on. Place now ""nutted"" cat on the vinyl floor. Open a beer Laugh till it hurts!  *****no cats have ever been hurt doing this.... their owners have however complained about sore belly's and having problems obtaining and maintaining their breathe!
