632554,Smitty1,2011-10-20 02:33:00,29,Hi Guys  I recently noticed I had a leak in my boat after some detective work I found it was missing a rivet so my question to you is - how do I fix it?? I have a side console Princecraft and the missing rivet is under the livewell area - I really don't want to rip up the boat. I have been told use a closed end rivet - I believe I have cherry rivets are these the same??  What is the difference between cherry and closed end?  Another option I am told is try the epoxy steel stick - it is the putty that hardens like steel - just fill it in and smooth it out.  Any opinions or help is appreciated.  Thanks Smitty

Carefully drill out the old rivet, wipe down with acetone, put a drop of 3M marine grade silicone around the hole, insert the rivet, keep it square, and squeeze, and put another drop of the silicone over the rivet.  This is the best repair.  http://www.hansonrivet.com/w22.htm  Michael   "
