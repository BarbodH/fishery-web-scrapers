631952,Terry,2011-10-18 17:09:00,14456,that is crazy  I don't know how he could have that much control to know how high off the ground he would be to hit the ballons
631959,tb4me,2011-10-18 17:24:00,3295,that was insane..The Wright Brothers would eat their hearts out..
631961,ccmtcanada,2011-10-18 17:39:00,7971,WOW!! Thought there were a few moments he was going to hit a tree or the ground there!  Unvelieveable!
631963,fishindevil,2011-10-18 17:43:00,6254,simply incredible !!! wow

631971,mike rousseau,2011-10-18 18:07:00,4661,OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   that was messed up...
631972,kickingfrog,2011-10-18 18:09:00,8333,Big deal. Squrriels have been doing that for a long time.    WOW!
631976,mercman,2011-10-18 18:23:00,7054,INSANE !!! I wonder how you discover you can do that Bungled suicide attempt  
631981,Roy,2011-10-18 18:37:00,13728,That was posted here last month or so. I must have watched it a dozen times. You can't really tell how fast the dude's going until that camera angle where there's a guy waiting holding up the balloons. It's the kind of clip you can't watch just once.  Thanks.
631992,Joey,2011-10-18 18:52:00,9122,"Wow, crazy stuff.  I like what he says at the end"
632048,blaque,2011-10-18 20:37:00,2419,"I saw this guy quite a ways back but never saw this clip. Thats the closest ive ever seen him buzz the ground. Awesome.  He had a documentary called ""fearless"" that was televised a while back and was talking about how a parachuteless landing was in the works. Something about landing on a ramp that would gradually transition him to a stop. Dunno where that ended up"
632137,kickingfrog,2011-10-19 00:42:00,8333,By what he said at the end I think he too was surprised how close he came to the ground on that one. I also think dude with the balloons needs a new pair of underwear.
