631669,mpt,2011-10-17 16:48:00,158,Thought this was fitting.... 
631686,ccmtcanada,2011-10-17 17:55:00,7971, That's great!  But I'm still thinking just get rid of em all....LOL
631855,BITEME,2011-10-18 13:05:00,1968,yeah could help too if you got stuck nothing a chain and a truck wont cure  Peter
630475,ccmtcanada,2011-10-13 12:45:00,7971,"Anyone out there have the skill, time and want extra money to remove a line of hedges I have along one side of my backyard? Lol  The maintenance on them drives me crazy. The cost, time  and labour to take care of them truly isn't worth it to me. They grow about 8 feet per year and I want them gone. There is a chain link fence there that will do until I have money to put up a tall wood fence.  Anyone want the job or can recommend anyone in the Whitby/Oshawa area?  Mods, if this belongs in another section, please go ahead and move it. Thanks!"
630488,Fisherpete,2011-10-13 13:38:00,1814,How many plants are there Cliff? I may know a guy who would be interested...
630493,ccmtcanada,2011-10-13 13:52:00,7971,"They really are a pain...for me to do it...it takes a full day to cut the tops off.  It involves me getting up on a ladder, using pruners on branches that are up to 2"" thick and a chainsaw on the thicker branches.  Then come the sides.  The time consuming part is bundling them up small enough for the town to take them as yard waste.  Quite frankly, it takes up a whole weekend...a weekend where I cant fish...LOL.   I'm not home at the moment...but I'd guess a dozen...maybe 15...  If he's interested, I can take better pictures and send them along so he can give me a quote.  Thanks!"
630494,Fisherpete,2011-10-13 13:54:00,1814,Sounds good... send me the pics and I'll get them to him.

630522,fishnsled,2011-10-13 16:02:00,3520,"A case of beer, pizza and an open invite to everyone and the job just might get done......better make it 2 cases of beer."
630528,ccmtcanada,2011-10-13 16:21:00,7971, You could be right Will...but a bunch of drunk guys doing the job...hmm...did I mention it was JUST the hedges to be removed? LOL
630536,Headhunter,2011-10-13 16:45:00,5703,"Cliff, we could bring guitars and entertain the workers.... HH"
630537,ccmtcanada,2011-10-13 16:47:00,7971, I hope they like Brown Eyed Girl....  I was actually thinking of going fishing while all the work was going on! LOL
630551,Spiel,2011-10-13 17:34:00,9065,  That'll work just fine Cliff if you arrange it for next weekend.
630552,Harrison,2011-10-13 17:37:00,2202, HA!!!!  Only if you follow it up with 8675 3O9 e ine.
630555,ccmtcanada,2011-10-13 17:43:00,7971, I like your thinking Chris!  Would be sweet after a weekend hunting steelhead and I come home to a hedge-less back yard!!
630556,fishnsled,2011-10-13 17:46:00,3520,  Do you think you could at least finish a couple of songs???
630558,ccmtcanada,2011-10-13 17:48:00,7971, Picky picky picky...  We'll give you a microphone and see how many songs you can finish LOL
630559,fishnsled,2011-10-13 17:51:00,3520, I'm not the one trying to pass myself off as a musician......

630569,ccmtcanada,2011-10-13 18:07:00,7971,It's a sad sad thing for me that all my non fishing threads get more replies than the fishing ones...
630572,fishnsled,2011-10-13 18:13:00,3520," You'd have to catch a fish for it to be a fishing report Cliff. OH! And take a picture of it.  All joking aside, it does seem to be the trend, not just for you."
630573,Spiel,2011-10-13 18:14:00,9065," It'll be an awesome weekend whatever the weather does Cliff, can't wait!  "
630576,Pikeslayer8,2011-10-13 18:22:00,336,CCMT  4x4 and a log chain   2 or 3 guitars should cover it.  Please send 2 cases Blue to Colorado.
630580,GBW,2011-10-13 18:30:00,8460,I hope that there aren't any wasp's there...
