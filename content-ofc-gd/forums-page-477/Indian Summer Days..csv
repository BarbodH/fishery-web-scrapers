632566,Jen,2011-10-20 04:34:00,833,"Reading your reports, I first see the fish, and then the whole entire picture comes into focus, the boat, how the colours behind you have changed and developed, the water clarity or depth , the smile behind your eyes, and then I hear the joy in your words... Such a pleasure your posts are ... a view through your eyes, however small into the spectacular place you call home!  Amazing fishing Drew, thanks for sharing"
