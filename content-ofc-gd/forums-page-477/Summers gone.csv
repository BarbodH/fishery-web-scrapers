Blue skys clearer when that old mill stream Flows cold water down a clean pipe dream Airs like apples in the mild day sun When summertimes race has run When summertimes race has run  It gets in your throat That melancholy mood Its bound to make you sadder But its good soul food Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh . . .  Round moons yellow and its gold light glows Bare, black branches in a blind breeze blow Old folk fables tend to talk like wine And younger times haunt my mind  Halloween comes and its the last sweet night Everything changes in the next days light One tough cricket sings his last lone song And wintertime comes on strong And wintertime comes on strong  Steve Forbert"
