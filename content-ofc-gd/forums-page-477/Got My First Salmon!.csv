At the end of the day I didn't want to get back into the truck and head home! Totally different way of fishing for me, this past weekend. These fish can pull:) Just thought I'd share my first one! "

631773,davey buoy,2011-10-17 23:18:00,5505,"Great catch!,of all the fish I have caught nothing IMO fights as hard as a 10-20lb salmon. Heaven forbid I ever hit a 25lb plus fish. Steel head,pike ,muskie,big bass etc, great fight .With up to 15min plus and spool you if your not careful,what fresh water fish can give you that?"
