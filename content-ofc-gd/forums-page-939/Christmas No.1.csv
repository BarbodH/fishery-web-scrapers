Not really a fan of Leona but the way she sang this would melt the heart of any lovely young lady so dont mess about any more and send your loved one or mum a copy of this if you can get hold of it.  Leona sings ""Run"" by Snow patrol they are great but this cover version is fantastic.  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl7r2ApESN4  Probably been done already and sorry it is a bit soon but happy christamas to you all. Yo Ho Ho  Regards Clive"

269435,jediangler,2008-11-19 20:21:00,1923,"I was astounded by her voice at the closing cerimony of the Beijing Olympics when she sang ""Whole lotta love"" with Jimmy Page. That girl's got some vocal chords. If Led Zep is still trying to dig up a singer for their american tour they should ask Leona to fill in for Robert. He can't hit the notes like when he was in his 20's anymore anyway."

Who the f*ck are Man United? And the reds go marching on, on, on  Hello, hello, we are the the Busby boys, Hello, hello, we are the the Busby boys, And if you are a city fan, Surrender or you'll die, We all follow United.  If ever they're playing in your town, You must get to that football ground; Take a lesson come and see, Football taught by Matt Busby.
