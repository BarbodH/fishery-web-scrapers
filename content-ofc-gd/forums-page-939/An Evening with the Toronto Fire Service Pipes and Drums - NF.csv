268172,Bly,2008-11-16 22:39:00,1556,"Back in August, Cliff was asked by his best friend, Adrian, a drum sargeant, if he'd be interested in lending a hand to the Toronto Fire Service Pipes and Drums Fall Fling.  After reading further in this post, you'll understand why there was no question that he'd be proud to take part.  The Fall Fling was put on to raise money for the group's planned trip to Holland in 2010 to be present, perform, and represent Toronto at the 65th Anniversary of VE day.   He was asked to play in a smaller group within the larger group called ""Fire in the Clan"", that played a combination of Scottish and Irish favourites, both traditional and current in style.  The Toronto Fire Services Pipes and Drums was established in 1998. The band was conceived by a firefighter as a traditional means of representing the Fire Service. The band comprises mostly of Toronto firefighters from all divisions who proudly wear the Toronto Fire Services Tartan.  The band regularly attends recruit graduations, promotional presentations, award ceremonies, department funerals (sadly they have attended 9 funerals this year of thier bretheran) and any other fire fighting related functions, as well as parades and community events.  More recently, they represented the TFS internationally at the 2008 IAFF Fallen Firefighter Memorial in Colorado Springs, and competed in the Orillian Highland Games, finshing second only to the Ontario Fire Service Pipes and Drums.  The Fall Fling was held at the Royal Canadian Legion, branch 258 on Saturday November 15th, beginning at 7pm.  After having dinner, we were treated to many hours of entertainment by some very talented people.  The Pipes and Drums group played throughout the evening, and was filled in with performances by members on the piano, Irish whistle, Highland dancing, clogging, shuffle pipes, drums, other performances, and of course Fire in the Clan.  Fire in the Clan was comprised of guitarists, drums, accordian and singers, all members of the larger band, many of whom are either with the TFS or retired from service.  Cliff's role was to fill in the sound with bass guitar and vocals.  Back in September, Fire in the Clan began rehearsing for the big night.  It wasn't until about a month ago that it was brought up that in order for Cliff to take part (they made sure he was totally committed to the event), that he'd have to wear a kilt.  I of course was thrilled    , Cliff was a little unsure.    So be prepared when seeing the following pictures of the evening!!!  The evening also included a very heartfelt  tribute to Retired Captain Ian Cochrane who recently passed.  Toronto Fire 1959-1994.  Ian holds a very special place in the heart of Adrian and many of our friends. Pipe Major, Gary Ford for Ontario Fire Service Pipes and Drums presenting a gift to Toronto Fire Chief William Stewart   Some pictures of the TFS Pipes and Drums in action.

268178,bigugli,2008-11-16 22:50:00,6138,"A worthwhile evening I'm certain, and a priviledge to be asked to perform.  One question Bly.  Did you instruct Cliff on the proper etiquette for wearing a kilt?  In particular, what not to wear."
268183,Leecher,2008-11-16 23:01:00,7832,Cliff you look real good in a kilt    and is a very honourable way to help out  Kudos to you    and keep it up Thanks bly for sharing Leechman

268931,snag,2008-11-18 14:31:00,1932,"Well that should end all discussions about who wears the pants in the family!   Outstanding!  I always thought I detected a little Scottish in you Cliff.  Honestly, I've worn a kilt at a wedding and found it very comfortable, delightfully airy and easily accessible after a few beverages. Quite practical.   "
268941,Rustic-Fisher,2008-11-18 15:03:00,826,"As a firefighter with Toronto fire,  Thanks!!      RF"
269003,LeXXington,2008-11-18 17:47:00,1928,"Excellent, the pipes always bring out the best in people.  WTG"
269099,Big Cliff,2008-11-18 21:50:00,6899,"Ok Cliff, is there ANYTHING you WON'T do for a very worthwhile cause LOL.  I am so very proud of you Cliff!!!!!!! You never cease to amaze me with your talents and charactor."
269159,Mike the Pike,2008-11-18 23:53:00,3421,Wow thats pretty cool  Like to see ya go fishing in a kilt  Coming from a scottish background I really enjoyed that and have always loved the music from the bag pipes.  My grandmother came from scotland to Canada in 1929 she is 88 yrs old today she is all there 100% and a true baseball fan.  She now lives in Northbay and lost her Scottish accent years ago.  Thanks Bly for posting that
269210,skeeter,2008-11-19 01:46:00,1907,way to go cliff. that just re-affirms every thing i said about him and bly in a previous post!!! im glad im part of the OFC!!!  dann
269212,Bernie,2008-11-19 01:53:00,3190,"Cliff you are a very amazing fellow. Good on you man! You have plenty of life experience already. Keep it up, it keeps life interesting. (for us too)"
269216,ccmtcanada,2008-11-19 02:20:00,7971, Thank you for all you do as well!  For me it was a small thing to be able to contribute...and a lot of fun at the same time!
269217,ccmtcanada,2008-11-19 02:22:00,7971,"Thank you everyone....although I felt a little out of my element in a kilt, once I felt relaxed wearing it, I was able to settle my nerves down.  A beer also helped out in that regard!!!  I was honoured that they even asked me to participate, as I had attended this event in the past as a spectator only.  I was proud to be able to help out and appreciated the opportunity.  If they'll have me back again next year, I'd love to lend a hand in any way I can.  Oh yeah...I was expecting more flak for wearing the kilt...bring it on...I can handle it....LOL"
269307,SlowPoke,2008-11-19 08:55:00,2984, I don't know why you'd expect flak over wearing a kilt but I am surprised nobody has commented on the pantyhose and nailpolish.
269313,Roy,2008-11-19 12:01:00,13728,Good on ya Cliff. The Toronto Fire Service knows how to pick winners.  Snag....the subway vents are a blast!
269375,bigugli,2008-11-19 16:38:00,6138, Nobody was supposed to know about that one.    Nothing like a little tunnel rat porn on Yonge st.  A   T.T.C. secret.
