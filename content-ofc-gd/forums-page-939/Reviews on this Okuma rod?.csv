269333,okumasheffield,2008-11-19 13:55:00,318,found this rod while surfing the net last night  It does not look like any of the Sheffield rods I have seen in stores  Any comments on this rod?  http://www.fishusa.com/tackleshop/catalog_...B6BA46&fx=1
269376,BillM,2008-11-19 16:41:00,17367,The reviews don't look very promising.
269381,kemper,2008-11-19 16:48:00,2232,"Never fished with a sheffield but I do have a lower model as a beater rod for floating salmon when there is nothing else to do. It fishes like a 13 foot piece of wet spaghetti...that said I HAVE landed a ton of fish (salmon and steelhead) on it without and problems.  Its probably heavy, and probably suffers from tip sag, but you get what you pay for."
269400,jdmls,2008-11-19 18:10:00,575,"for $200 I would buy a St.Croix Wild River Monday, Tuesday , and twice on Wednesday .... Okuma Steelhead gear is bottom of the barrel . Makes good backup gear....new Sirata included"
269409,kemper,2008-11-19 18:46:00,2232,"  For $230 I BUILT one.  and I love it...mostly because I built it.  St croix rods are a good choice if you are not looking to break the bank on a float rod. Its no IMX but hey, it does the job"
269548,okumasheffield,2008-11-20 00:34:00,318,thanks for the input  was looking for comments from people who have used it
