They decided it wasn't fair to make one of them stay with him the whole time, so they voted to take turns.  The first guy slept with Ralph and comes to breakfast the next morning with his hair a mess and his eyes all bloodshot.  They said,' Man, what happened to you?'  He said, 'Ralph snored so loudly, I just sat up and watched him all night.'  The next night it was a different guy's turn. In the morning, same thing - hair all standing up, eyes all bloodshot.  They said, ' Man, what happened to you? You look awful!'  He said, 'Man, that Ralph shakes the roof. I watched him all night .'  The third night was John's turn. John was a big burly ex-football player; a man's man. The next morning he came to breakfast bright eyed and bushy tailed.  'Good morning,' he said.  They couldn't believe it! They said, 'Man, what happened?'  He said, 'Well, we got ready for bed. I went and tucked Ralph into bed, patted his butt and kissed him good night. Ralph sat up and watched me all night.'"
