269564,canadadude,2008-11-20 00:54:00,769,"Thats why we fish Port D, nice steelie dan"
269569,canadadude,2008-11-20 01:05:00,769,"Dude it's not that wide a harbour, why bring the boat in there ??? if you want to fish the drift do it from shore, if you fish from the boat do it in the lower sections away from the shore anglers, if you want to fish the upper come fish on shore an drift!! It 's not nuclear science here dude if you want to fish the upper drifts leave the boat on the trailer if you want to boat fish, fish the areas the shore dudes can't reach!!!!! But don't run your drift through 35 shore guys or there going to get ticked, don't you get it!!!"
269570,aniceguy,2008-11-20 01:11:00,1094,  wow I cant believe you actually told me to leave my boat on the trailer lol........I dont even know how I can respond to that LMAO wow....Im still chuckling....
269573,Feldie,2008-11-20 01:15:00,3,Hey Dan It's me Chris Feldman (FishinFeldie)
269575,knightfisher,2008-11-20 01:16:00,237,"  Why would anyone go up a channel where they see at times 30 or so guys on either side, chucking lead. The channel is maybe 50 yards wide by half a mile long. Us shore guys fish the beginning of the channel maybe using up 40 or 50 yards of it. I would never bring my boat up in there looking at either side see guys casting, and think every single one of them is going to see me and stop fishing. I was fishing the channel a few weeks back from a boat, with a bud Paul. As he approached the shore guys he basically stopped far enough away to ensure he would or the boat would not be in their way. Smart thinking. I mean you have a half mile channel to fish, why going in tight amongst the shore guys, makes no sense at all. But then that's just my view point."
269576,BUSTER,2008-11-20 01:18:00,1336,WOW
269581,Feldie,2008-11-20 01:25:00,3,Hey Dan I'm the unknown guy in the picture. FishinFeldie (Chris)
269582,canadadude,2008-11-20 01:25:00,769,"We are shore trash, but thats because unfortunatly we don't have a boat, sorry for my comments before dude but I can set you up on a pile of trouties and you will not have to put up with any shore dudes. PM the dude I'll set you guy's up on a few drifts"
269585,knightfisher,2008-11-20 01:28:00,237," Hey Chris, I thought it was you, but was not sure with the side profile, sorry Corrected buddy."
269590,canadadude,2008-11-20 01:32:00,769,"Fish'in fredie, I'm the dude or Johnny  nice pic brother I hope to see you drifting soon, ya I'm the ugly guy that rides the bike, in the grey coat in the pic!! Looking good freedie hahahahahahaha"
269598,canadadude,2008-11-20 01:46:00,769,"Take me out and let me run your boat for the day dude, I'll set you up with lotsa trouties and we'll never bother a shore fisher all day, I know that harbour and don't worry the dude will catch fish! When the fish are up tight in the fast drift leave your boat on the trailer dude, you may be chuckling but I know the fish down there, I know what freaking runs there sitting in, I can call fish if I hit the right spot on the drift so don't freaking laugh dude, I fish that harbour 12 months a year, I know every drift in there hahahahahahah"
269616,BeRad3000,2008-11-20 02:03:00,65,"This has got a little out of hand don't you think guys. Were all on the same team. Team OFC. Good luck out there! It sounds like an awesome spot, i'll have to make it up there sometime this winter."
269626,solopaddler,2008-11-20 02:10:00,8605,Suddenly Port Dalhousie looks a lot less appealing to me.
269631,canadadude,2008-11-20 02:14:00,769,"Your right dude the whole thing is way outa of hand, if you come up this winter and see me on the bike don't be afraid to say hello!! Lottsa of steel in the winter in the harbour but streamers seem to be the answer then, give the dude a shout I tie my own and know what colours are work'in"
269647,Greencoachdog,2008-11-20 02:44:00,8163,"I will say it is ignorant for any boater to encroach on a shore fisherman's opportunities, I've had it happen to me before and it's not a pretty sight (I was fishing from shore). A boaters opportunities are nearly infinite, whereas a shore fisherman's opportunities can be very limited!  It's just plain rude and stupid!!!"
269649,Roy,2008-11-20 02:47:00,13728," It probably looks a lot less appealing to many folks. I think we should just let them re-load and let the Port D chamber of commerce have at least a tiny chance at trying to fix this.Getting your picture in the paper sure turns some folks into..well, just very strange. Good luck, DUDES."
269487,canadadude,2008-11-19 22:24:00,769,"the posse did not only comment on this behavior we got the MNR down there to lay a few thousand $$$ in charges, and stop the rappage of our smallmouth fishery. We are a small group of local anglers but we do not in anway put up with overharvesting and rapage of our fishing hole!! Our efforts have lead to increase MNR presence and the protection from the white bucket brigade, in noway do we encourage vistors or anyone not to harvest a few fish for a meal but we don't want to see our fishery raped! As for me I encourage people to come down and enjoy what our fishery has to offer it's good for business and it's good for the community. I will say that at times we will be very vocal and will watch anglers if they abuse limits and such and you wil be reported, like I said before catch your limit but limit your catch"
269519,bluetop,2008-11-19 23:38:00,3,"Hi Bruce are you trying to hurt the club things that you type about are insane as secretary of the stcatharines game&fish as well as the other executives we have a duty to promote our fishery whats wrong with your mind.On your other thing about my ""partner"" if your talking about Jay Pusikiw mypartner who runs the trout derbies you have mistaken him for another Jay its not nice creating slander about someone who helps the fishery a great deal.Keep up the effort Jay and ugly your sniffin to much lead"
269521,irishfield,2008-11-19 23:41:00,26272,Sad when even the steelhead threads with no steelhead go into the dumpster....
269525,canadadude,2008-11-19 23:52:00,769,"Well dude I'll tell you it's because we catch lots of fish, it may look like a zoo and it is at times but some of us don't have $30,000 boats so this the chance to access the fishery!!! We all catch our trouties and the more people that show up INMO shows the government how important this fishery is!!!!!If we didn't get the crowds and such the MNR will have no idea how important the stocking program of the great lakes is!! I like seeing the out of towners coming to fish our resource, it brings in business to the local tackle shop and such and perhaps may put Port D as one of the great troutie destinations on the map, at least thats the goal for me, so I don't mind the crowds in fact I like it, it shows the MNR the potential of our area!!!"
269536,canadadude,2008-11-20 00:05:00,769,"I know what your saying dude , but hey if any of you dudes need some advice down at Port D ,hit me up , I'm the dude riding the  bicycle you can't miss me, I'll set you up with leader length and weight for the right bounce imformarion is FREE dudes just ask"
269537,jediangler,2008-11-20 00:05:00,1923,"Why have I never seen a fight between fishermen of any species other than trout? I stopped fishing Bronte creek years ago because of fights I witnessed. I'm not making a judgement, just asking a question. Must be because of the proximity between anglers. I guess if musky fishermen had to fish shoulder to shoulder they might scrap too, but somehow I doubt it. Maybe it's because of the reverance placed on the species as an almost holy entity and the fact that catch and release is nearly 100%. While the trout is viewed more as a meal and if someone tried to steal off the table of my family I would probably act the same way. Is it only coincidence that most of the bashing on all fish boards, not only OFC, revolves around these anglers?"
269545,solopaddler,2008-11-20 00:29:00,8605,"I've fished off that wall a fair bit this fall since moving to Grimsby, can't say that I've encountered anything other than pleasant like minded people.  Although I can see how a novice not in sync with everyone could wreak havoc LOL!"
269550,ironstone74,2008-11-20 00:34:00,201,"I only fished Port once last fall and I had a blast.  We were there early 4:15 and got into some fish.  It's a busy spot but I must say, the guys around me were very friendly and helpful.  One gentleman, Tommy, actually gave me a warm drink to help me stop shivering.  I was really impressed and will be back soon; I owe Tommy one!  Paul"
269551,knightfisher,2008-11-20 00:36:00,237,"Well said Canadadude and bluetop you guys speak the truth.  Here is a fish I caught today, and bluetop got yesterday.          "
269553,rhare,2008-11-20 00:38:00,387,"   its more the circumstance then it is the fish type. How many other species besides trout and salmon do you see guys lined up along the river for? Its not just port its anyplace you fish with these types of crowds.Look at the docks in barrie, guys getting heated over some dinky perch.    On a side note the locals at port have never been anything but nice to me, they even offer up a coffee if a extra is kicking around!"
269557,canadadude,2008-11-20 00:42:00,769,"I totally agree with you, some how a fresh chrome steelie or brownie brings out the most  of the angler comunity, but in there defence I fished walleye, Bass, Muskie and all other sportfish but once I started steelheading the other species come a close second.hahahah !! I mean I go out on erie and get 6lb smallies and they still don't give me the thrill of getting a 3lb steelie fresh run, I guess I'm a trouter now, steelhead fishing is a disease and I love it! Perhaps it's there look or there crap not to bite but what ever it is once you start steelheading you get adicticted quick, it's like crack to fishing hahahahah"
269563,aniceguy,2008-11-20 00:54:00,1094,Port D what else can be said then what was said......I had a boat 2 boats ago that had a dozen dents from some shore anglers thinking they own the river and figure its ok to cast at my boat that was pretty much straght into the middle of the place.....even a few weeks back when we were very cautious of the shore anglers we still had a few OZ come close to hitting the boat...and it was on purpose of that I have no doubt.  I have fished off the shore there many a time and never really had an issue ( of course continual casting over ones line isnt an issue there I guess ) but get on a boat and forget it the entire dynamics change where some and Im not slamming anyone or anythign like that but some of the shore anglers think its ok to brush off a boat with an OZ of lead.  Shore trash in some cases at its finest
