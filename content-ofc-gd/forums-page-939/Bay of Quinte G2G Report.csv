268584,Joey,2008-11-17 22:00:00,9122,Great report and pics as usual Mike.  You got my mouth watering with those filets in the frying pan pics.  Joey
268586,Terry,2008-11-17 22:03:00,14456,good to see you again and great report  I am glad to say I didn't get any sheephead this year.......LOL
268817,Mike the Pike,2008-11-18 03:25:00,3421, Hey Don I looked for you guys Skeeter sent me a pic of his new boat but I could not spot you.  I threw off quite a few people saturday I opted for my black Mustang jacket and full rain gear. No big bird suit.  BTW congrats on getting rid of the three year curse the skunk is finally gone . I was skunked last year so it felt good to land some decent fish..Have not had a double digit since 2006
268820,Mike the Pike,2008-11-18 03:29:00,3421, Yes Roy they do give quite the tug and run they just look so ugly and smell like dirty socks.  Sometimes when the fishing is slow it gets the blood pumping that is good on a cold November day.  Well thanks for the kind words folks.  MTP

269651,huntervasili,2008-11-20 02:49:00,1604,Way to go out there Mike looks like ya had a great time. Glad to see even the guy in the yellow suit catches a fish now and again. Hopefully I can get over there for next fall... Thanks for the report
268255,Mike the Pike,2008-11-17 01:48:00,3421,"Well it was that time of year time for my 4 day trip to my Favorite fishing hole the Bay of Quinte.  Arrived around 8:30 am Thursday with good friend GlennK met up with Superdad while we unpacked had a great chat with Dave Was finally great to meet Dave who has had so many entertaining BOQ reports.Chatted for or while until Percher,Slowpoke and Fishin Devil arrived.The boys arrived and I got some new toys that Percher picked up for me.  He also picked up this special item a full face mask for cold November.   The boys all had there laughs about my new portable winshield. Yesterday Irishfield showed me a pic of me zooming by Friday morning sporting my mask Maybe he can post Darth Vader in the tiller boat     The winds and rain  picked up so we made a decision to launch at the ferry and that was the right decision.  Now on with the report and pics.  So we finally get out on the water Thursday and my rod goes off ZZZZZZiiiiiiiiinnnnnngggggg and I knew right away oh no its a sheepy Now the thought went through my mind then I remember meeting up with Terry in the BOQ October 25th and must have caught Sheepyitis from him.What a scrap though all 11lbs of the slimy stinky thing   The fishing was a little slow but I did manage this little guy before we ended the short day.   Here are some more pics from the our weekend.   First for GlennK of the weekend.      Well what do you know and my line goes off again Zzzzzziiiiiiinnnngggg. This time I was trying to take my sweater off but had to grab the rod so my suit dropped down around the boots OH NO then Sheepyitis set in        A shot of Percher and Slowpoke ,Fishin Devil was out with Memart.   Caught my smallest Goby to date how did this get on   Saturday evening a shot of Slowpoke and Lexington. This years winner of the Quinte G2G was Lexington who caught a 13lb 1oz walleye Congrats Paul find a place for the Trophy for one year.Please post us a pic of that beauty fish.  Gerritt,BassmasterMike,and Ted.     A shot of Bitsmith2K another guy named Mike  Good to have finally met Sean TBayboy thats him having a good time laughing like   You will have to forgive GlennK he is getting better with the Camera but hardly uses it due to the fact I had to take several pics of his fish this summer cause I wasn't catching much this year.            Thanks to GlennK we had hot Homemade Pea Soup in the pouring Damp miserable rain Saturday.  Saturday evening alot of people said they could not find me Saturday on the Water. I swapped the yellow Big Bird Floater Suit for my Mustang jacket and rain gear. Nice thing about my suit people can spot me a mile away       We kept the little ones for the table let the big ones go to swim another day. Unfortunately one took the hooks too deeply so she was kept for consumption.   Friends Phil,Kenny,Slowpoke,Memart and Percher,GlennK and Fishin Devil.   Some one was thinking about me and yellow    Well I hope you enjoyed my report!!!!  Scroll Down   Would you like to see some more.   Are you sure!!!!!!    Some more pics   Are you ready   Ok just some teaser pics   Here they are.  Oh wait a minute   1 2 3         MTP"

Thanks for report and posting all the pics!"
268301,superdad,2008-11-17 02:56:00,353,"Good report Mike.  Fishing was slow on Thursday and I guess again on Friday, BUT it sure picked on Saturday - EVERYBODY was getting fish.  What a Difference a Day Makes........  Nice to have had a chance to chat a while - we'll see you again on Quinte....  David  aka  Superdad"
268304,fishdawg,2008-11-17 03:13:00,912,"nice going  curious tho as to why the sonar was in ""Fish ID"" mode?"
268306,Mike the Pike,2008-11-17 03:16:00,3421, Fishdawg for now I find it really hard to identify the fish in regular mode with arches just more comfortable this way.
268327,HTHM,2008-11-17 04:18:00,4082,Looks like I missed a good time Saturday night......&^*)(^*^%$&%$&*# car!  Well there is always next time!
268331,Badger Shark,2008-11-17 04:31:00,291,Sat. was definitely the best day this year.  And the arch setting is a much better way to use your electronics.
268332,Dondorfish,2008-11-17 04:33:00,1000,"Way to go Mike! Sorry we didn't get a chance to cross paths with you. I was trying to watch out for you guys, and I am sure we past each other on the water. We ( Skeeter and myself ) did not have as good of luck as you guys, but we did manage to pick up a couple -the small one was just over 2 lbs ( but really fat ) and the larger one was 6.6 lbs.  Don"
268339,OhioFisherman,2008-11-17 06:29:00,6623,Great pictures! Nice fish!
268345,Roy,2008-11-17 11:17:00,13728,Great report Mike. Glad you had a good (and safe) trip. You have some nice fish there. I know that sheepies are not what you were after but they still are a lot of fun to catch aren't they?  Thanks for sharing.
