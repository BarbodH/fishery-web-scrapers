269799,drwxr,2008-11-20 17:02:00,453,sometimes its the action of the lure not the lure that needs to be changed.
269802,BillM,2008-11-20 17:31:00,17367,"Not ice fishing related at all, but when fishing for steelies, I make a change every 10 drifts or so..  I got more then one hookup by doing this with the new bait on the first drift."
269841,wallyboss,2008-11-20 19:23:00,1095,It all depends on what the fish tells me. If they rise to take a look at it and don't take it. I'll change the action first then i'll change the lure usually downsizing it.
269930,Wild,2008-11-20 23:10:00,704,"Since fish rely heavily on sight color is the most important factor followed by size if they are inactive, subtle changes make all the difference."
269934,kemper,2008-11-20 23:15:00,2232,  Wow every ten drifts?  Ive been known to throw the same bag out there for 50-60 drifts...hahaha
269947,Muskieman,2008-11-20 23:49:00,2472,I think that I've had the same Jig on my line for 2 seasons this will be my 3rd  Make sure it's sharp throw a Minnow on it and send it down.  ..chartreuse/orange works for me!  RFS
269951,Muskieman,2008-11-20 23:52:00,2472,  EH!    I just watched that video  had his minnow been put on the hook properly he'd of caught that Walleye faster...nice fish though.  Just goes to show how presentation plays a BIG role in catching or not catching fish.  RFS
