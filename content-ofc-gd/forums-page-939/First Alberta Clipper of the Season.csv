An Alberta clipper over western Lake Superior this morning will make a beeline towards the lower Great Lakes tonight. Snow is expected to spread into southern Ontario during the day. It will reach the Golden Horseshoe area by this evening.  Periods of snow should continue tonight before tapering to flurries early Thursday.  Snowfall accumulations of around 5 to 10 centimetres are likely for many regions. The snowfall will tend to be rather wet in the shoreline localities along lakes Erie and Ontario including Toronto. This may limit accumulations somewhat in these communities.  Snowfall amounts over eastern sections such as Peterborough Trenton and Kingston may be somewhat less as these areas will be near the edge of the weather system.  In the longer term..A significant snow squall event is shaping up For Thursday and especially Thursday night and Friday for areas to the Lee of the Great Lakes. A snow squall warning will likely be issued this afternoon for the affected areas.  Motorists should use extra caution later today and tonight due to reduced visibilities and potentially accumulating snowfall making roads somewhat hazardous. The Thursday morning commute may be longer due to slippery conditions and some snow accumulation.  Listen for further statements. Additional information may also be found by consulting the latest public forecast. The next public forecast will be issued by 11 AM.  END/OSPC
