269511,tinbanger,2008-11-19 23:25:00,1028,"ate way to much at Madarin last night and woke up before 5 am.  decided to take the long way to work via Midland !  Been hoping to get back out on GBay one more time but with - 17 degree temps at 5 am things are not looking good. Midland launch has been 'plowed' most likely by the dreging company who appear to still be working ( barge and excavator) in the channel. about 1 inch of comacted snow/ice makes launching out of the question even with a shovel and salt.  Took the 5 k drive to Pentanguishene and the ramp there has been plowed and is BONE DRY concrete Should brought he boat along as forecast is not looking good for the next several days. slight skim of ice but still workable . some smart guy still has his boat in the marina there.  Fiqures . stored the boat way too early last two years , held out this year and look what happens.  I know , I know go ice fishing ! But Nov 19 is way too early .   Will just need fairly decent driving weather to get down to Niagara ..maybe friday  TB"

269554,Cudz,2008-11-20 00:40:00,2652,I work in Penetang. I saw today that there was a thin layer of ice on it but by no means unusable.  Last week end a buddy of caught a 16 pound eye in the bay.  Good fish there right now
269556,irishfield,2008-11-20 00:42:00,26272, I won't hold that against you! LOL  Problem with ice... it's real hard on transducers/speed sensors/trailer lights launching !
