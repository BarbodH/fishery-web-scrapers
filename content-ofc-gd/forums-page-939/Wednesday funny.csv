The doctor arrived, and examined the baby, checked his weight, and being a little concerned, asked if the baby was breast-fed or bottle-fed. 'Breast-fed,' she replied. 'Well, strip down to your waist,' the doctor ordered. She did. He pinched her nipples, pressed, kneaded, and rubbed both breasts for a while in a very professional and detailed examination. Motioning to her to get dressed, the doctor said, 'No wonder this baby is underweight. You don't have any milk.' I know,' she said, 'I'm his Grandma, but I'm glad I came.'"

269475,Ron,2008-11-19 22:03:00,1683,"Hey Wayne,  I had hoped to attend the festivities but Mom just got home Thursday night. With some great help from Cupcake on Wednesday and Thursday, I was able to abuse my friendship and he let me lean on his shoulder for a couple of days. I can't thank him enough for being there for me.  I'm hoping to be able to spend some more time on this forum once again. I have stepped down from being the webmaster for MCI and was going to take a break. I am still actively working on the FMZ 17 advisory council and seeing as I had time on my hands stepping down as webmaster, I er should I say we, have formed a new Chapter of MCI in the Kawarthas. More on this latter.  Looks like you guys had a blast out there on BoQ! Too bad I missed it."
