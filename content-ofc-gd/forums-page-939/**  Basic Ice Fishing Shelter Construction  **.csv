269761,jerdog,2008-11-20 15:10:00,39,One piece that is wrong in that video is that Carbon Monoxide (ie. the silent killer) is heavier than air. The vent at the top may help bring new air in but don't depend on it to let the CO out.  http://www.safety-council.org/info/OSH/carbon.htm

269897,jerdog,2008-11-20 21:54:00,39, Except that hole is filled with water and even heavy gas is lighter than water and a lot of anlgers put snow around the hut to keep the draft out.  Every year a couple anglers die in the fish hut due to CO poisening.  If you use a heater in your hut be aware of the dangers.
