You reel steadily along a weedbed giving your rod a twitch now and then, when suddenly the water explodes and your rod is suddenly bent in half as your opponent tries to dive for deeper water.  You play the fish out, wondering what on earth could pull so hard, but finally bring it to the surface beside the boat, where you find...  THIS:    !  Possibly a photo-chop job, but I'm not so sure.  Anyone ever come across something like this?  B"

269642,bigfish1965,2008-11-20 02:37:00,3382,"Wait till you see the picture of the pike caught in Manitoba/Alberta/Lake Nippissing or the sturgeon caught in BC/lake Nippissing/Lake Erie We've got quite a litany..we could have our own Snopes page here. Fishing Snopes... Fish 1- Pike with two bodies, one head..False...the smaller fish has its head under the gill plate of the larger fish Fish 2- GIANT Ontario/Manitoba/Saskatchewan et al Northern Pike...False...the fish is a northern pike but was caught in Scandinavia...most likely Holland. Fish 3- GIANT Lake Sturgeon caught in Ontario/Sask..etc....False..it is a White Sturgeon from the Fraser River in BC."
269644,irishfield,2008-11-20 02:40:00,26272,Now come on Rick... Fish #3... absolutely not true. Caught by a group of OFC'rs... going thru 15 cases of beer over 2 days while reeling that baby in!

269682,douG,2008-11-20 04:46:00,2693,"Richard, Richard, Richard.  That massive pike was caught in Holland.  People from Holland don't say Holland, they say Netherlands.  Sorta like saying Czechoslovakia, that place doesn't exist either.  And Netherlands is many many miles from Scandinavia, about 2000 Km from Amsterdam to Helsinki.  Not real close.
