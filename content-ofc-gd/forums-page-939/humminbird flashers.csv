269196,buckster,2008-11-19 01:07:00,530,I have owned 3 vexilars and i stand by them 100% They take a beating and have never let me down
269386,Leecher,2008-11-19 17:26:00,7832,"Last year I used an FL-8 that a friend had and enjoyed seeing pan fish bite my micro jig on the way down  Here is a link to Vexilar site, check out their different pack they have available for the FL-18  http://www.vexilar.com/pages/products/prod..._fl-18_ice.html"
269408,Uncle Buck,2008-11-19 18:45:00,1000,"They Look Great, i'd however wait a year or 2 to see what kind of reviews they get and to see how they last...  which marcum do you have? I've got an LX5 and see no reason to ""upgrade""  all in all, any flasher will help you put more fish on the ice...  vex is like the lowrance of flashers... good unit, overpriced, lacking features, living off it's name rather then innovations"
