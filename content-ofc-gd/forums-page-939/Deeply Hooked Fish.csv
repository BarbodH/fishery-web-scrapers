269329,Greencoachdog,2008-11-19 13:34:00,8163,"Not everyone is familiar with this method, but it is the best way to remove the hook from a fishes gullet! I stumbled on this method as a kid fishing for Bluegills and have used it my whole life. It's not just for baithooks, it works with lures and treble hooks too.  http://www.in-fisherman.com/magazine/artic...oval/index.html"
269331,Leecher,2008-11-19 13:50:00,7832,"Thanks Glen, very informative and will surely give this technique a try if I ever deep hook a fish"
269334,forrest,2008-11-19 13:55:00,1032,"Great link GCD.  I am going to try that too.  There is still the common myths that fish hooks will dissolve from stomach acids and leave the fish OK or rust out.  Both of those things are false, often fish are released to experience a slow and painful death.  forrest"
269342,snag,2008-11-19 14:19:00,1932,"Thanks Doggie,  Bookmarked!"
269345,jwl,2008-11-19 14:25:00,1056,"hey pretty cool  when I was a kid I always thought the technique was to take the sunfish, put on the ground, step on it's head and yoink the hook out    Then you could take a knife, cut it up into strips, use that for bait when you ran out of worms and rocks to turn over, cast your bobber back out there, and repeat the process   All kiddin aside, I have used that trick in the article before with bass, works pretty good, thanks for sharing the link"
269347,Whitespinnerbait,2008-11-19 14:26:00,2038,"Excellent tip GCD.. Thats a must try for next season , thanks"
269361,bicephalic,2008-11-19 15:46:00,112,Great to know - thanks for the link!
269363,Wild,2008-11-19 15:52:00,704,I remember that trick from years ago and it still is a good method. Thanks Dawg I will send some ice fishin weather down your way as a little bonus
269365,DANIMAL,2008-11-19 16:08:00,215,Great technique. I read another artical by In-Fisherman that suggested that 80-90% of fish released with a hook in there thoat or stomach die within one year.
269367,qaz,2008-11-19 16:19:00,26,"The biggest improvement has been the increased use of ""barb-less"" hooks. With out a barb the hook is nothing more then a curved needle and will slide out of flesh very easily.  Good for fish and fisherman when it comes to hook removing.."
269387,ctdd2006,2008-11-19 17:31:00,531,Awesome stuff!   I didn't know that.  Thanks GCD.  Maybe that'll mean less snot rockets coming home from now on!
269399,Hotrod2066,2008-11-19 18:04:00,40,"That's a great technique for removing the deep hooks, I've been doing it for a few years and it works well and is alot better than leaving the hook in."
269552,MCTFisher9120,2008-11-20 00:37:00,3761,"wow, looks fairly simple and if the event ever happens i will be sure to try my best to do this. Thanks for showing the tip."
269603,aws,2008-11-20 01:52:00,53,Hey Thanks!! Never knew about that but always wondered if there was a better way.
269611,canadadude,2008-11-20 02:01:00,769,"Great post, I knew I'd learn somthing off this site!! That is the all time greatest post I've gott'in off the internet dude I'm definitly going try that technique......Thankyou"
269914,ccmtcanada,2008-11-20 22:42:00,7971,Wow...ya learn something new everyday.  I'll have to give that a try...thanks Glen.
269928,Daplumma,2008-11-20 23:07:00,1961,"Good link.It works like a champ.I fish mostly with barbless circle hooks when I use bait,makes deep hooks few and far between.Most of the deep hooks I get now are from Senkos. Joe"
