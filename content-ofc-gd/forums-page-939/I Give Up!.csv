269305,carp-starter,2008-11-19 08:46:00,253,"Would I be correct to assume that you have lost what you had written?  No matter what I write, I always compose my literary piece using a ""WORD DOCUMENT."" I also save the document frequently.  I finally will do a ""copy & paste"" into the area where I could have composed the narrative. In your case it would have been from a Word document to the narrative area of setting up a post.  Doing it my way, you do not have to worry about accidently hitting the wrong keys, have your computer go down or what ever.  The most wonderful thing about my way is that you will not have to spend a lot of time rewriting your original should there be a disaster. But do not forget the frequent ""saves"" while you are typing.  I know it hurts to lose 7 hours worth of writing. Good Luck.  carp-starter"

269324,Greencoachdog,2008-11-19 13:03:00,8163,"I've had the same thing happen Bubba, and it is very frustrating!!!  I guess a word document is the way to go, but I don't use them. I will however copy my long reports and post before hitting the ""add reply"" button now though. Then if it goes to smithereens the first time you can paste it for the second time."
269326,johnnyb,2008-11-19 13:24:00,3413,"Ouch...sorry to hear, man.  Sounds like it was a good 'un"
269327,steverowbotham,2008-11-19 13:27:00,1800,git back at er.  we're waiting lol
269335,Paulus,2008-11-19 13:56:00,522,"computer crash? Sometimes I just hit ""back"" on the browser, and all the stuff is still there. But if your computer  died after you hit send or post or whatever, then it's definitely time to mix a drink and relax for a while. I find nothing more frustrating than trying to start over, right after a disaster like that.  a short cut for you: if you ""edit"" your post on the ""other"" board, you can copy/paste it into your post on this board. They use the same BB coding. You'll have some minor edits and probably major additions to make, but at least you've got a workable pre-written version...  p.-"
269337,forrest,2008-11-19 13:58:00,1032,I feel for you solopaddler.....been there.  Make a backup of your post via copy and paste and your typing will not go to waste.
269343,Leecher,2008-11-19 14:21:00,7832,"Sorry to hear that solo.... hope you'll reconsider  Like others said, I always select and copy the text I just typed and then hit the preview button to review for typos then hit submit  Leechman"
269350,highdrifter,2008-11-19 14:36:00,2534,"OH NO!!!!  I feel your pain Mike...  At least it wasn't 12 pages of an insurance policy that you had to translate and it was 4 in the morning and your boss was on the verge of castrating you because you were spending too much time on that stupid fish site!!  How about just supplying us with the pics?  With all the hooplah and the loyal following from all your minions, your credibility may be on the line a little..  C'mon!  FISH PORN!!!  cheers HD"
269366,solopaddler,2008-11-19 16:13:00,8605,"Should've copied and pasted, didn't. That won't happen again. I'm going to start again right now."
269430,Pachone,2008-11-19 20:14:00,276,"ouchhh. I really HATE when that happens. Take ur time mikey, even though everytime I look at the threads, im just waiting for it to pop up. Hope ur fam is doing well.  Pachone"
