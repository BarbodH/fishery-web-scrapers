269290,dp3200,2008-11-19 05:27:00,31,"What are peoples thoughts on neoprene vs. breathable for waders? Based on the reports, it looks like breathables are preferred, but what about in the winter? Is a pair of fleece pants enough under breathables to keep warm?  Personally I have always used neoprenes. I never fish in the summer months and I've always found 5mm of neoprene nice in the cold waters of the eastern tribs. Now that mine are leaking I've been considering a pair of breathables. My main concern with them is a)keeping warm and  durability.  I know there is a big price difference between the two, but I buy a pair every 10 years, so I'm not too worried about $200 for breathables instead of the $100 for neoprenes."
269299,kentooley,2008-11-19 06:24:00,208,I used neoprene waders for years. Pain to get on and off and you sweat like a pig in milder weather. Bought a pair of breathables last year (way more comfortable)...fished 3-4 times a week all winter...no problem. Polypropylene socks and underwear in extreme temps and in milder weather you can go commando.  :lol:  :lol:
269300,kentooley,2008-11-19 06:25:00,208,Sorry. Double post.
269354,tbayboy,2008-11-19 15:02:00,1497,I've got breathables and even with long underwear and double wool socks I found myself going a bit numb fishing the rivers in October (wading up to my waist at all times).  That said they're great for every other time of the year but I think next season I'm going to have both available.
269355,anders,2008-11-19 15:06:00,1168,"i have both.  I really like the neoprene waders in the winter and fall, with long underwhere and wooly socks, very rarely do i get cold.  The breathables are awsome in the summer."
269379,DANIMAL,2008-11-19 16:46:00,215,I find breathables a lot more comfortable. And if you buy them big enough to fit        3 or 4 layers of fleece under them they are plenty warm.

269668,Dozer,2008-11-20 03:19:00,896,"I use neoprene... early winter make sure you have some T.P. handy, its a quick and unexpected assault most of the time, especially after a long hike"
269669,Paulus,2008-11-20 03:29:00,522,"I switched to breathables a long time ago, and have no issues with cold. My only beef with them is that they are not as durable - but since I fish late into the spring with them, I'm happy compromising durability and a bit of cash for comfort and ease of use.  They also dry a lot faster, inside and out. That's a big plus in most conditions.  p.-"
