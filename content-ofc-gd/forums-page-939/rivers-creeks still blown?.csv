Love the site and the fish porn:) I'm no newbie to fishing but like women, it is very unpredictable;)... I was thinking I know we got alot of rain on saturday and the temps are pretty cold. But i have the day off tomorrow and was thinking of hitting a local trib, it is pretty resiliant to rain unless its the spring. I was wondering if anyone has seen the water levels as of late or if everything is blown still? Also from experience I dont recall the water freezing up after only a few short days of cold temps, am i wrong? Conditions look perfect tomorrow, besides the ice on my guides and floats. If the water is anything but blown im sure It will be better than it has been. Crazy inconsistent weather this fall for the steelhead, but its looking alot more promising as the season slowly comes to an end, I have a serious itch to go before it freezes up. Any advice would be much appreciated since I dont drive and have to take the go train everywhere. Thanks in advance everyone, looking forward to my time at OFC."

269170,ccmtcanada,2008-11-19 00:20:00,7971,"Water shouldn't be blown tomorrow if the last major precip was Saturday in your area.  In fact, it was probably prime today to fish.  Not sure where you are thinking of trying but if it's not far, then take a drive to take a look...you just never know!  Welcome to the board...hope to see a report from you soon."
269172,carpediem,2008-11-19 00:22:00,4,"   lol I hate those debating situations, I think I will tho just wont forget I tried going last spring to the same trib at least 3 different times, and it was blown everytime, we had lots of snow tho, wish me luck, and damn I wish I had a camera, I will post a report when i get back, gotta love this time of year when the salmon snagging and crowds die right off, nothing like fall/winter steelheading!!!"
269175,carpediem,2008-11-19 00:27:00,4,"Thank you and I am from the gta area, going to fish the west end. I would figure it would be better now but we did get like 40mm of precip in the last week"

269187,ccmtcanada,2008-11-19 00:46:00,7971," Last spring it took forever because of the daytime melting caused many of the creeks to be very dirty, even though there was no precipitation.  No issue with daytime melting as of yet.  Go fish and report on your experience!!"
269223,jdmls,2008-11-19 02:32:00,575,no car Hmmmm.... Just jump a cart on the CN rail...It'l pass right over lots of fishable creeks. Try to tuck and roll on the jump off    ... just f'n with you... any creek east of the 400 should be a no brainer right now...
