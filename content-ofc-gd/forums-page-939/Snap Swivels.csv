If I am constantly changing my presentation throughout the day with numb fingers.....I think I would be wasting precious fishing time fumbling with the line and lure.  What are the pros and cons of using a snap swivel?  Should I use one at all?  Thank you in advance for your help."
269794,richyb,2008-11-20 16:41:00,774,I always use one while ice fishing ..  quick to change hooks and also you dont get the mssive line twist you would get from jigging a spoon tied direct.
269798,DANIMAL,2008-11-20 17:02:00,215,"Unless line twist is an issue, Just use the snap. I use stay lock snaps in 30-50 lb and they are small and light enough that they dont effect the action of most baits. For small jigs and live bait I like to tie direct to be a little more finesse."

269832,dheitzner,2008-11-20 18:50:00,314,"I never use a snap or a snapswivel while icefishing or otherwise(next to pike/musky fishing with a leader). I think that in clear water especially, the snap/snapswivel discourages bites.  If line twist is an issue, I'll throw a micro swivel 12 to 18"" up the line. I have had more than one occasion when I am killing without a snapswivel and my buddy isn't getting any action with one. Trust me, it's worth the cold hands while tying a knot."
