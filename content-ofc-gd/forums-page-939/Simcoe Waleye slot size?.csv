269416,Cudz,2008-11-19 19:40:00,2652,is there a slot size for Lake Simcoe Walleye? I want to fish for them tonight and was just wondering.
269418,bassjnkie,2008-11-19 19:50:00,1101,Yes. Here you go. Click zone 16 http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsF...L02_163615.html
269419,DANIMAL,2008-11-19 19:52:00,215,"S-4; not more than 1 greater than 46cm (18.1 in.) C-2; ""                                                          ""  You really should get a copy of the regs."
269422,Cudz,2008-11-19 19:58:00,2652,"So what I understand is that I can keep a total of 4 walleye with one being over 18.1"" .  That is cool so there is no real slot walleye that have to be thrown back unless you already have one over 18.1"""
269423,DANIMAL,2008-11-19 20:00:00,215,  You got it.
269462,Mattitude,2008-11-19 21:27:00,155,I hear a Simcoe walleye is a very elusive fish.  Good luck!
269464,jwl,2008-11-19 21:33:00,1056,"yepper, when they generalized the regs in a couple areas, that's the deal. For example, where my trailer is used to be 6 fish no slot, as of 2008 it's 4 with the same 18.1 fish in the mix"
269493,misfish,2008-11-19 22:43:00,29133,"Theres been alot of acedental(sp?) catches here in the bay the last few years,and when you do get one,they are a good size. They seem to follow the crappie and perch that come in."
269510,Cudz,2008-11-19 23:23:00,2652,lol!  Yep A couple of tens recently from the shore.  THey are crushing smaller perch when the perch is caught and refuse to let go.  I am on my way out there tonight.  Should be nice and cold but I don't care.
269512,misfish,2008-11-19 23:26:00,29133,"You cant use perch for bait. ,L M A O Good luck to ya Cudz."
269529,Cudz,2008-11-19 23:57:00,2652,I know but if I catch a perch and reel him in really really slowly... lol.  Just kidding.  I bought a dozen medium minnow at Simcoe bait and Tackle at 4:45 this evening before they closed (she actually gave me about 18).  You are more than welcome to come.  I will be out there at about 9 pm.  It will be like ice fishing but without the ice.
269609,Rizzo,2008-11-20 01:59:00,4754," ah that explains it. I had my little guys out a while back catching some dink perch on the scooby doo rod when one of the rods just bent over. We lost the fish, I just figured it had been a pike."
269640,steverowbotham,2008-11-20 02:34:00,1800,I've caught two in the bay .. ever.  But they were 7 and 9 pounds.
269687,Cudz,2008-11-20 05:37:00,2652,"Fished from 9 pm until 11 pm.  Only caught a bunch of perch.  Lots of them there that is for sure.  Oh well, still got out fishing."
