I don't know the town well at all but I'll have my GPS if anyone feels like sending me a PM with a decent place to go.  So if you see a guy in a suit fishing from shore say hi   Thanks all.  Geoff"
269174,kerr,2008-11-19 00:25:00,77,try whippin a few off the causeway for pickerel or pike as well as of the puc docks near hotel dieu hospital. there is also thousands of lakes north of kingston that arent too far with some good shore fishing.
