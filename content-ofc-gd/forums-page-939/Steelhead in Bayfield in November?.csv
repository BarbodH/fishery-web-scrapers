265006,bowj,2008-11-06 01:32:00,8,Does any body know if there are steelhead in the Bayfield yet?  I am heading down there for steelhead for my first time on Sunday and was just wondering if it is worthwhile.  Or should I head to Goderich?

269633,solopaddler,2008-11-20 02:15:00,8605,Bayfield should be on the high side but fishable. Definitely fish in the river.  Welcome to OFC btw.
