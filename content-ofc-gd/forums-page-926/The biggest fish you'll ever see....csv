282058,Handlebarz,2008-12-20 22:03:00,3790,Why's that fish trying to eat a white rabbit?
274370,danc,2008-12-02 04:46:00,4677,"I found this incredible photo on a local fishing message board, and I just had to pm the poster asking him if I could share it here. And thanks to Mike Faulkner, he obliged. So check this out. Does this look like a good place to drop a line or what??  Thanks Mike.  "
274371,Pigeontroller,2008-12-02 04:47:00,2793,"He shoulda got a pic with measurements!  Sorry, couldn't help myself!"
274372,Beats,2008-12-02 04:49:00,543,I looked at that pic the other way at first and it kinda looked more like Nessie.

274415,SlowPoke,2008-12-02 09:07:00,2984,Where's the fish? All I see is a cloud shaped like a cormorant lying down.
274417,solopaddler,2008-12-02 10:02:00,8605,"No Dan, this is the biggest fish you'll likely ever see!  ""Each year, a few people were drowning or disappearing mysteriously in Huadu's Furong Reservoir. It was not until recently, when the son of a government official went swimming in the reservoir and was drowned, that the secret was revealed.  It is a 3 metre long man-eating catfish whose head alone is 1 metre  wide! After cutting up the catfish, people were surprised to find  the remains of another man inside!  Swimming  in the reservoir is now forbidden because it is feared another similar man-eating catfish is still lurking in the waters.""    "
274421,Clampet,2008-12-02 11:01:00,1947,Looks like a Snook.
274423,Spiel,2008-12-02 11:09:00,9065,"....That is really one spectacular photo Dan! Thanks for sharing it.     And this man eating catfish sure looks like a harmless whale shark to me Mike, praps you're just baiting us?"
274425,Rich,2008-12-02 11:17:00,3927,"Geeze if I ever saw that over a lake anywhere, anytime.. I'd be going to fish there. That's just way too much of a sign!!"
274433,outllaw,2008-12-02 12:09:00,1232,here kitty kitty. i can imagine the glob of worms you would need.
274435,Canuck2fan,2008-12-02 12:18:00,1444,"Both pics are awesome!!!  However I thought the biggest ""fish"" I ever saw was me in the mirror when I got hooked into buying red Trilene XT fishing line? Oh well I won't make that mistake again LOL."
274438,joonmoon,2008-12-02 12:27:00,528,Nice pics guys and I have to agree with Canuck2fan. I don't much care for the red line either.
