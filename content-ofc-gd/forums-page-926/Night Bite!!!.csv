281642,iceslayer,2008-12-19 17:54:00,97,"Went for a Night Bite crappie hunt last night.  I was the first person on this pond so far and man were those fish ever on...  About 15 bluegill's and 5 crappies in 1 hour, but they were HUGE.  It was a lot of fun all domed up in my new Scout, with a lantern hang'n above my head and endless, drag'rippin, panfish at my toes.   Man I love this early ice.  I wanna head out to Valens on Sunday.  I've never fished there before and was wondering if anyone wants to join??  Cheers!  "
