281823,nancur373,2008-12-20 01:55:00,1211,Must have missed tihs post. Nice fish.
281860,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-20 03:27:00,3761,O no it's the end of the world
250859,ozaibak1,2008-09-18 15:40:00,401,"What a beast, congrats!"
250866,JeffBornFishin,2008-09-18 15:49:00,260,Nice fish!  Way to go!  Thanks for the post
250870,johnnyb,2008-09-18 15:57:00,3413,yup -- definitely a BIG bass...nicely done!  Now go get a measuring tape and put it in your tackle-box!!!
250879,Rizzo,2008-09-18 16:34:00,4754,"zoinks (said in best shaggy voice) that is a beauty. 5 pounds for sure, but I've never actually seen a bass over 24 inches so not too sure about that. Seems like when they get to 22 inches they just get fatter rather than longer. Either way, one heck of a bass"
250889,Mr. Follow,2008-09-18 17:06:00,34,Nice Fish what a cow or is that Muskie bait??????hmmmmmmmmm
250905,sharper,2008-09-18 17:37:00,279,"Great Catch! Rapalas are the best, caught some of my biggest fish on them as well."
250969,wuchikubo,2008-09-18 20:58:00,1114,WTG and Congrats on your PB bucket mouth!
250977,salmon,2008-09-18 21:32:00,334,Hey Nice Bucket I know were that is I am going on the weekend with my two sons. How is the weed situation ? Jose
251039,Pigeontroller,2008-09-19 00:24:00,2793,"Thats just an average Bass, for Florida!!!!  WTG! I say its abit over 6 pounds, maybe pushing 7 pounds!"
251049,Radnine,2008-09-19 00:54:00,1538,Wow man! Well done
251060,frozen-fire,2008-09-19 01:16:00,542," Choked with weeds as it is all the time. Doesn't really change haha. I was about 30 feet away from shore. The fish were caught in about 2-3 feet of water with about 3 inches of free water between weeds and surface. Perfect for topwater if you plan your casts according to where the weeds are. It's tough... every other cast we would be bringing up strands of weeds. Pays off though, cause big fish like hiding in weeds hehe.  I would love to get a replica done, but i have no proper measurements and it won't be the same. photos will do.  Seriously... what are my chances of catching another one like this?"
251137,splashhopper,2008-09-19 12:49:00,2931,"nice fish.  Hint: When i forget to take a measuring tape, i will lay the fish down at the butt end of my  rod and snap a few pics. Then I can measure from the pic later.  I can't get the weight though."
251224,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-19 18:16:00,0,Nice hog! Chartreuse is the best color for big largies!
281782,profisher25,2008-12-20 00:21:00,185,"WOW, amazing fish!!!!! what size lure is it?"
281787,Terry,2008-12-20 00:34:00,14456,"you realize you are dragging up old posts, some over a year ago... why you wanted to welcome someone to the board who joined in aprils..just isn't cool"
281789,mikegta,2008-12-20 00:40:00,39,now thats a bucket mouth...........congrats
281792,profisher25,2008-12-20 00:46:00,185,"Well... first of all, i was only browsing the forum and i simply wanted to congratulate him with his fish, i didn't realize that it was such a problem to comment on an old post, i really don't see the problem, but whatever, also,, this was posted  only about 3 months ago,so its not really that old, plus, i  don't understand, but if you seem to have a problem with ppl commenting on old posts, why are you commenting? Look, i don't want to start any problems between you and I so do not take this as some sort of war."

281794,Leecher,2008-12-20 00:54:00,7832, This is the third time this week that I noticed so what is it with replying to old post??  Why not just pm the member??  No offense and certainly no war..... just asking why???
281796,modny,2008-12-20 00:59:00,502,haha that guys head could fit in that fish's mouth
281798,Rich,2008-12-20 01:01:00,3927,Nothin' wrong with seeing some old fish porn make a comeback!
281800,BassAsin,2008-12-20 01:08:00,806,ok i realize this is an old thread AGAIN! BUT! lol     if you didnt get a measurement i can help ya with a few measurement s on the computer comparing the size of the J-11 in his mouth compared to its full length the fish would be just shy of 25 inches long if that lure is 4 inches in length!  sorry folks didnt really wanna comment on an old thread but figured i could let ya'll know the trick of comparing to a known object in the pic and P.S nice bucket!  Matt!
281803,Terry,2008-12-20 01:19:00,14456,you  are right some are ok  but bringing up an old welcome thread from a year ago isn't cool and I felt you are starting a trend. so I made my comment....a pm on an old thread is the practical way to go
281807,BassAsin,2008-12-20 01:25:00,806,are you sure you have been here long enough to be voicing that kind of opinion terry?   hahahahha jk
281812,Terry,2008-12-20 01:33:00,14456,yup as I always say anyone can voice their and I have been doing it from post one/ day one ...LOL
250738,frozen-fire,2008-09-18 03:38:00,542,"My friend and I decided we would do some 'close to shore' fishing in an inflatable. We hit the lake at about 5 PM and starting to fish in some very weedy water. I had a nice topwater hit on my second cast and I manage a decent 1 lb largemouth. We don't see anymore action til about 6:30 or so when I get a nicer 2.5 lber. Not nice enough for pics though! A couple casts later, I see something making a disturbance in the water, following my rapala J-7. It was like a torpedo! It hit, and I set the hook. Solid. Fish took it deep into the weeds. It feels really good, as it gets closer to our inflatable, I see it swirl it's body. I notice that it was really long looking, and the first thing that came to my mind was that it would turn out being my first musky! I start to get worried as it gets really deep into the weeds and won't move. I eventually pull everything up and see a huge head... it's a largemouth! I lip the thing not knowing how big it was and when the whole fish is out of the water, I start screaming. Didn't have a scale and also no measuring tape. It still swims and is to be caught next year by me when it gains weight This fish was over 2 feet. Heaviest bass I've caught, and I've managed to get a couple 5 lbers in the past. Pics don't really do it justice as we were on a tiny inflatable and couldn't take any better ones.    "
250742,Governator,2008-09-18 03:58:00,879,"Wow.. Very nice congrats!! Amazing pics, I think he makes you look tiny."
250743,HTHM,2008-09-18 03:58:00,4082,"Well, I am impressed. How long did it take to briing it in?"
250744,Cudz,2008-09-18 04:00:00,2652,Nice hawg!  Congrats!
250749,brickNblock,2008-09-18 04:12:00,598,Thats one heck of a bass there Bud....... I dont know about 2' but it sure is one heck of a hog and ifn you've alreaqdy caught several over #5 then you would know for sure if your approaching #6... Regardless.... Thanks for letting me view that great looking bass. bNb
250751,limeyangler,2008-09-18 05:13:00,5204,that is a real hippo....lol......nice fish....congrats
250752,frozen-fire,2008-09-18 05:41:00,542," It was probably a few minutes... before it threw itself into a pile of weeds, it was an awesome fight! It never came up to take a leap, just kept it's nose down and took us for a ride in the inflatable. I find that fish tend to stop fighting after getting wrapped up in some weeds. It seems to subdue them."
250754,frozen-fire,2008-09-18 05:46:00,542," wow, now that you mention it... i do look tiny! pics could've been better, they were just taken with my cell phone, and we were in an inflatable. Pretty much sitting next to each other, no room at all to get a better shot in."
250756,OhioFisherman,2008-09-18 07:18:00,6623,"Nice fish for sure, just hard to get a guess from just a picture."
250758,Tarzan's Jane,2008-09-18 07:44:00,1183,Nice fish...congrats on your PB.  I'm sure you had double the fun in the inflatable.

250773,ChrisK,2008-09-18 10:44:00,2772,Now thats a bucket mouth if I ever seen one. Nice fish !! If you ever get the oportunity to do a replica of that bad boy in the future it would be a great wall hanger.....  Congrads
