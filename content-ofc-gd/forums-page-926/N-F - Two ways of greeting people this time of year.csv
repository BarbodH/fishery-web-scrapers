I am posting it because it was and is humourous.  carp-starter   To my Liberal friends,  Please accept with no obligation, implied or implicit, my best wishes for an environmentally conscious, socially responsible, low-stress, non-addictive, gender-neutral celebration of the winter solstice holiday, practiced within the most enjoyable traditions of the religious persuasion of your choice, or secular practices of your choice, with respect for the religious/secular persuasion and/or traditions of others, or their choice not to practice religious or secular traditions at all. I also wish you a fiscally successful, personally fulfilling and medically uncomplicated recognition of the onset of the generally accepted calendar year 2008, but not without due respect for the calendars of choice of other cultures whose contributions to society have helped make America great. Not to imply that America is necessarily greater than any other country nor the only America in the Western Hemisphere. Also, this wish is made without regard to the race, creed, color, age, physical ability, religious faith or sexual preference of the wishee. By accepting these greetings, you are accepting the aforementioned terms as stated. This greeting is not subject to clarification or withdrawal. It is freely transferable with no alteration to the original greeting. It implies no promise by the wisher to actually implement any of the wishes for herself/himself/others, and is void where prohibited by law and is revocable at the sole discretion of the wisher. This wish is warranted to perform as expected within the usual application of good tidings for a period of one year or until the issuance of a subsequent holiday greeting, whichever comes first, and warranty is limited to replacement of this wish or issuance of a new wish at the sole discretion of the wisher.  For My Conservative Friends:  Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!"

Turns out as she was leaving  BestBuy, the greeter said the her ""Happy non-denominational holiday!"" She said to him ""What!?!"" He explained that management was not allowing them to say Merry Christmas to people anymore. She told him ""That's stupid"", and wished him a Merry Christmas anyway."

281676,POLLIWOGG,2008-12-19 19:23:00,835,"This anti anti Christmas thing all started from an American white supremest publication as a rant against well pretty much everybody that wasn't an American white supremest . So the greeting they really want you to use is a raised fist and ""white power"".  If everybody tries not to get sucked into promoting it , it might go away in 10 or 20 or 30 years."

281695,irishfield,2008-12-19 20:31:00,26272,"FROM:    Patty Lewis, Human Resources Director  TO:         All Employees  DATE:    October 01, 2008  RE:       Gala Christmas Party  I'm happy to inform you that the company Christmas Party will take place on December 23, starting at noon in the private function room at the Grill House. There will be a cash bar and plenty of drinks! We'll have a small band playing traditional carols...feel free to sing along. And don't be surprised if our CEO shows up dressed as Santa Claus! A Christmas tree will be lit at 1:00 pm. Exchanges of gifts among employees can be done at that time; however, no gift should be over £10.00 to make the giving of gifts easy for everyone's pockets. This gathering is only for employees!  Our CEO will make a special announcement at that time!  Merry Christmas to you and your family,  Patty   ===========================================================================3D  FROM:    Patty Lewis, Human Resources Director  TO:         All Employees  DATE:    October 02, 2008  RE:       Gala Holiday Party  In no way was yesterday's memo intended to exclude our Jewish employees. We recognize that  Hanukkah is an important holiday, which often coincides with Christmas, though unfortunately not this year. However, from now on,  we're calling it our ""Holiday Party."" The same policy applies to any other employees who are not Christians and to those still celebrating Reconciliation Day. There will be no Christmas tree and no Christmas carols will be sung. We will have other types of music for your enjoyment.  Happy now?  Happy Holidays to you and your family,  Patty    ============================================================================  FROM:   Patty Lewis, Human Resources Director   TO:        All Employees  DATE:   October 03, 2008  RE:        Holiday Party   Regarding the note I received from a member of Alcoholics Anonymous requesting a non-drinking table ...  You didn't sign your name. I' m happy to accommodate this request, but if I put a sign on a table that  reads, ""AA Only""; you wouldn't be anonymous anymore. How am I supposed to handle this?  Somebody?  And sorry, but forget about the gifts exchange, no gifts are allowed since the union members feel that £10.00 is too much money and the executives believe £10.00 is a little chintzy.  REMEMBER: NO GIFTS EXCHANGE WILL BE ALLOWED.    ============================================================================  FROM:  Patty Lewis, Human Resources Director  To:        All Employees  DATE:   October 04, 2008  RE:        Generic Holiday Party   What a diverse group we are! I had no idea that December 20 begins the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which forbids eating and drinking during daylight hours. There goes the party! Seriously, we can appreciate how a luncheon at this time of year does not accommodate our Muslim employees beliefs. Perhaps the Grill House can hold off on serving your meal until the end of the party or else package everything for you to take it home in little foil doggy baggy. Will that work?  Meanwhile, I've arranged for members of Weight Watchers to sit farthest from the dessert buffet, and pregnant women will get the table closest to the restrooms.  Gays are allowed to sit with each other. Lesbians do not have to sit with Gay men, each group will have their own table.  Yes, there will be flower arrangement for the Gay men's table.  To the person asking permission to cross dress,  the Grill House asks that no cross-dressing allowed, apparently because of concerns about confusion in the restrooms.  Sorry.  We will have booster seats for short people.  Low-fat food will be available for those on a diet.  I am sorry to report that we cannot control the amount of salt used in the food .  The Grill House suggests that people with high blood pressure taste a bite first.  There will be fresh ""low sugar"" fruits as dessert for  diabetics, but the rest aurant cannot supply ""No Sugar"" desserts. Sorry!   Did I miss anything?!?!?  Patty   ============================================================================   FROM:   Patty Lewis, Human Resources Director  TO:         All F#$&*ng Employees   DATE:  October  05, 2008  RE:         The F*%#ing Holiday Party   I've had it with you vegetarian pricks!!! We're going to keep this party at the Grill House whether you like it or not, so you can sit quietly at the table furthest  from the ""grill of death,"" as you so quaintly put it, and you'll get your fu&*^%g salad bar, including organic tomatoes. But you know, tomatoes have feelings, too. They scream when you slice them. I've heard them scream. I'm hearing them scream right NOW!  The rest of you weirdos can kiss my *ss.  I hope you all have a rotten holiday!  Drive drunk and die,  The B* from HE*^!!!!!!!!    ============================================================================   FROM:  Joan Bishop, Acting Human Resources Director  DATE:   October 06, 2008  RE:        Patty Lewis and Holiday Party  I'm sure I speak for all of us in wishing Patty Lewis a speedy recovery and I'll continue to forward your cards to her.  In the meantime, management has decided to cancel our Holiday Party and give everyone the afternoon of the 23rd off with full pay.  Happy Holidays!  Joan"
