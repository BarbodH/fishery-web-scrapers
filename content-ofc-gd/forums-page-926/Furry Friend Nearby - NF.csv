281157,Leecher,2008-12-18 17:18:00,7832,"As I was leaving the building from work and walking towards my car, something caught my attention in the corner of my eye.... I looked over and I thought it was a cat but to my surprise, it was a rabbit     Did not have my camera with me    but only my Blackberry Curve with built in camera, 5x zoom.  Tried to take a shot from a distance but the zoom is not the best so I proceeded to walk towards it slowly.... it did not move. When I got close enough, took a quick shot of it eating grass    I took a few more steps and snapped another shot    Since it did not move I thought I'd take a few more steps to get closer but this time I was too close for his comfort, started running and stopped a couple of feet away.... snapped another shot and this time the pic is a little better but not the quality of a digi cam    The building is located in a residential area next to the Gatineau Park and just never know what animal you'll see come close to the houses in the neighborhood. Thought I'd share this moment Leechman"
