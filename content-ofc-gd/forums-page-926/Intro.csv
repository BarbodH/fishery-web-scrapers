281492,mikegta,2008-12-19 12:17:00,39,hey guys  well i have been a member of this board for about a year now and for the most part have been a lurker. i figured it was about time i introduce myself so here it goes  as my nick states my name is mike. i am 24 yrs old and live in hamilton. I work in oakville/mississauga in construction. I am VERY busy over the summer months so i tend to frequent the board a whole lot more in the winter months!!!  I just got out for my first ice fishing excursion last new years and have been addicted ever since  I have gotten ALOT of very helpful information from this site so i think it is about time i try and contribute what i can     MIKE

I have however got some great info and insight from many of the regular contributors.  Thought I would introduce myself, my name is Dirk and I have a cottage on Rice Lake in the Roseneath area. I have always been into fishing but really didn't become serious about  it until purchasing a cottage and a boat towards then end of the summer this year.  Hope to make many more visits to the site beginning today.  Dirk"
