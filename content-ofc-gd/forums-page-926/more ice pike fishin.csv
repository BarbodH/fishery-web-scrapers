281311,BassAsin,2008-12-19 00:29:00,806,went out to a little lake other than my favourite today always good for a feast of perch and some pike ended up with a bunch of good perch 3 pike and a small wallie too! didnt know they were in there. i know your all saying i should have let the pig go but she was caught pretty good in the gills and i didnt think she would have made it!   
281369,pike slayer,2008-12-19 01:55:00,1177,im pretty sure the pike your holding isnt the one in the other pics. what was the size of the pike laying on the ice?
281379,BassAsin,2008-12-19 02:12:00,806,one on the ice was 36 inches about 13-15 lbs it was taken just before dark when we were leaving and no flash on the cell phone camera. the other might of git the 24 inch mark
281380,Leecher,2008-12-19 02:18:00,7832,Great report and pics BassAsin  Real nice looking pike there..... WTG Looks like you guys are freezing on the last pic  Great job and thanks for sharing Leechman
281383,waterwolf,2008-12-19 02:23:00,556,"if she's hooked pretty deep and not sure she'll make a healthy recovery,, don't chance wasting a beautiful pike. better on the table than rotting on the bottom. even hardcore c&r guys have to keep to take some colateral damage home sometimes. great day on the hard stuff ,, and a bonus eye to boot .   congrats."
281392,ciceri,2008-12-19 02:33:00,535,"you are a lucky man, i'd love to be out hammering them."
281396,BassAsin,2008-12-19 02:44:00,806,thanks Leech!   and yea it was getting cold 17- and 27- with wind
281399,BassAsin,2008-12-19 02:47:00,806,SHE big female was hooked bad enough that from the fight the gills on one side were almost coming out her mouth. i always use a single 2/0 soft plastic wide gap worm hook to help prevent this from happening but gonna taste good i think and your right i didnt need to be feeding the mudpout and crayfish.
