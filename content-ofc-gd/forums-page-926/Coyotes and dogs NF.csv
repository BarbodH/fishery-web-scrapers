QUOTE(fireball Posted Today, 11:19 AM) I agree.  But I think we're outnumbered around here so I'm keeping my head down.  The reason is relatively simple - because this is a residential area and IF the animal posses a risk then in a residential area precautions do have to be taken. If you read the original post is was posted as a general question with concerns for a family pet that is being let loose in a fenced back yard and knowing that wild animals in winter time look for food any place they can get it I was just trying to get educated about the capabilities of a coyote.  I for one, enjoy the thought very much knowing that any time I look out my window I have the pleasure and privilege to see a number of exciting creatures such as Hawks, Eagles, Blue Herons, Beavers, Deerâ€™s, coyotes , rabbits, owls and even once a grouse.

I can see if the farmers have problems with their livestock, I have no problem in them protecting that. As for not questioning YOU, I'll leave it at that and go watch some nature in action while there's still some left."
281203,ch312,2008-12-18 19:25:00,1590," odd, i have yet to meet a hunter that doesnt shoot a coyote any chance they get. you clearly have no idea how bad coyotes can be for the wildlife you love to watch. too many yotes in an area will decimate the population of small animals, turkey and deer. coyotes are like noodle roaches...you can kill a bunch of them, but never all of them.  hunters (and farmers) who shoot all the coyotes they see are not trying to ""play almighty"" like you claim. they simply know how bad of an effect coyotes can have on an ecosystem if their population is not kept in check. the only predator of the coyote are wolves so here in SW ontario, its a hunters duty to keep the population in check.  are you a hunter?"

If you take too many out of the equation, then the other critter become more prevalent.  Now if we could train the coyotes to visit Jane & Finch..."

I have never shot anything living that I didn't want to eat or that wasn't a danger to myself, family, or livestock (or needed to be dispatched for humaritan reasons). It's just the way I am!  Last year I had a coyote walk out in front of me, a mere 20 yards away, it had no idea I was even in the area and believe me, if I had wanted to shoot it, I could have, no problem! I chose not to for a number of reasons; it was beautiful to watch, it hadn't done me any harm, it wasn't a threat to me or my family, and I was deer hunting.  Do I regret it? not for a second! Do I judge you because you choose to hunt them or shoot them, not for a second but I don't think your statement "" i have yet to meet a hunter that doesnt shoot a coyote any chance they get"".

281443,Northhunter,2008-12-19 03:45:00,214," Nature does keep itself in check... too bad there's not much of it left that doesn't have some human influence messing that balance up (that's not a reference to hunting).  Coyotes are very intelligent and opportunistic. In an area like southern Ontario a bad winter will not kill them off. They can do very well on on things like carrion and deer, but when that resource isn't easy pickin's they can simply fall back on things like livestock, if such things are not the staple already.  The fluctuation you see from year to year is more likely due to disease (stuff like mange takes its toll) or simply animals moving on to a different food source."

281665,POLLIWOGG,2008-12-19 19:01:00,835,"Let them eat the coons first. WE trapped over 50 coons last year and less than 10 this year after a pair of coyotes moved in. You could see the tracks in the corn fields where they hunt coons and skunks.

Never seen them eat a lot of corn before.  Saw them run up the road out front last night."
281746,ch312,2008-12-19 23:04:00,1590,"i think the coyotes love coons because of all the fat they have. fat = energy. coyotes need lots of it to survive harsh winters, along with most other critters.  the problem with letting nature take its course and self regulating populations is once coyotes have moved into an area, their numbers wont start to go down until all the food in an area is gone. then they move out of that bush after they've eaten all the critters and then it happens again.  im a member on a couple predator hunting forums and a guy who shoots hundreds every year always uses the saying ""after dooms day there will only be 2 animals that survive. coockroaches and coyotes"". judging by how smart and resourceful these critters are, id agree   they should have their nice thick coats now...good for auction"

281930,Ramble,2008-12-20 08:24:00,713,"if you have 'yotes in the area, then keep an eye on the pouch when he's outside. After dark letting him run and take a leak then bringing him back in is no problem. Leaving him out side for extended periods might not be the best plan but it doesnt sound like you are doing that. If don't see sign of them in your yeard, or up against your fence i wouldnt worry too much.  As for all this other stuff. I feel the need to remind you guys about the fecundity of coyotes 1st, and their highly adapatble nature...not to mention a few guiding principles of population ecology.  #1 Fecundity...bacically the harder you hunt the coyotes the harder they reproduce. Females will bread in year 1 instead of year 2 if their population is under pressure. Litter sizes will increase and the females will really try and protect their young, by moving them everynight to a new den site if need be. A common problem with 'yote populations is that they are hunted hard for a few years, then the hunting stops...BOOM population expolodes in a few years time.  #2 Super adaptible animal, for their size nothing beats them. About the only thing that can keep them in line is wolves. They have a serious hate on for each other. There is 'yotes in the industrial parts of TO that are totally nocturnal, living in an ashphault environment. They are amazingly resourceful animals.  #3 Bad winters and you see coyotes preying on more deer. That is natural selection in action. Coyotes taking over the role of the eastern wolf. it'll keep your deer populaitons healthy, so don't worry about it too much.  #4 Carying Capacity. Coyotes can't exist on nothing. If you are seeing high populations of coyotes then there must be a high population of food stuff. They have an extemely varied diet and with most species they will feed on what ever provides the most energy, for the least amount of work. That usually translates into whatever has the largest population. Pets fall nicely into that spot. Easy targets. Especially tied.  #5 populations will adapt. Except for a few critters such as Fishers and Marten, its fairly hard to decimate an animal population to the point its gone. Turkeys are smart and populaitons are growning, of course coyotes are going to eat them. If they are eating them, then they arnt eating something else, likley something that has a lower population level. Remember all this stuff works together as a system. Sometimes portions get a little out of balance, but hunting as a management tool is ultimatly flawed. The system is missing something or else it would be in balance. Hunting for coyotes takes the place, and is an excellent tool for situations for example where coyotes have learned to prey of cattle calfs as they are being born.  But for large scale populaiton control, it's very hard to acheive results with hunting. Some animals hunting can work for like bears, but coyotes are far too adaptable long term. However it is the easiest option for the gov't and hunters like to hunt, so it works very well.  Anyway i think i have rambled on enough here....just a little food for thought.  -R-"
