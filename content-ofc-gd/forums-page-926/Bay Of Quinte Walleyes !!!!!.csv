I'm sure you guys had a blast. Geoff, did you use anything else than the Double Cowgirls for them walleyes? ha ha ha ha  Cheers, Ron..."
264494,GNODDY,2008-11-04 02:46:00,163,Ron you leave my cowgirl out of this. She hasn't done anything to you LOL.    I have to say it was a tough day until the afternoon when we started changing things up and using a little longer lines. It was a pleasure to fish with you Shawn and I appreciate you letting my tag along. Percher that fish was dynamite my wife would probably give you a kiss right now if you were in Oshawa. She was in heaven when she came home from work tonight and I had it all cokked up and ready to go.  Geoff
264514,Moosebunk,2008-11-04 03:23:00,3970,"Great fishing man, in some crappy cold temps.  Warm weather up here in the north this week.  Maybe it'll head your way for the weekend."
264521,ehg,2008-11-04 03:48:00,2666,Those are some amazing walleyes for sure. Lots of big walleyes for you this year so far. Probably more to come...

281463,profisher25,2008-12-19 05:51:00,185,"I have heard way to many stories about the walleyes that come out of that bay.... the size of them are ridiculous!!!! ... I dont want to seem stupid or anything, but does anyone know how well the ice fishing is there?... also in the summer.. is there any good shoreline fishing on Quinte?PM me if you can reply, thaty would be greatly appreciated."
264151,fishindevil,2008-11-03 02:04:00,6254,"Well off to the bay of quinte myself & jeff[gnoddy] went,we left oshawa about 3:45am !!! and got to the bay in search of big walleyes,about 6am,and before we left the glenora launch jeff made a sacrifice to the walleye gods,and we had our fishermans prayer,and we started about 6 miles east of the ferry,and fished,and fished,and fished,for hours without getting any walleyes but we did get 3 big sheep-heads and 1 was at least 12lbs,they are huge,and man they fight hard too!!!!,we did lots of lure changes as well as depth changes trying to get a few of the tons of fish were were marking and no takers,so finnaly after not giving up,we started to get into some walleyes about 1pm in the afternoon,as we were running very long leads,sometimes as much as 280ft behind the in-line boards,i was using manns stretch 20's and tail dancers #11,running at 220ft back,at about 30ft,there were lots of big fish down 30,40,60ft but that can be the death zone,for walleyes as they might not survive the depth change so i did not try for the fish deeper than 40ft,so we hit some very nice  walleyes all between 8-11lbs !!! i have some of the pictures and jeff has some too,it was a blast fishing with jeff,he is a great guy,and is welcome in my boat anytime,thanks for comming to the bay with me jeff !!!!im sure jeff will make a report as well,he had a camera as well,and took pictures too,so i will post mine ,i also have some scenery pics of the bay !! sunday i fished with dan a.ka. percher,and it was very cold at -6 with windchill at -10,man everything was frozen and the bay was very rough with 3-5ft waves and wind comming from the west at 20kph,so if you know adolphus reach you know thats wicked,and big waves we were in dans new lund,man what a machine !!!!well we didnt get any walleyes just 10lb sheep-heads,and called it a day at 11am !!! so there will be more report to come,enjoy the fish-porn !!!! cant wait till 2 more weeks when we are down for 4 days at our get together !!!!

264202,Badger Shark,2008-11-03 05:24:00,291,"Well good for you guys staying in and working that area hard, it paid off for ya.  Wish we had the same luck but Sat. was the only skunk in my boat this year, not even a sniff.  But hey what can ya do.  I think it was just to nice out there and way to much in the way of boat traffic driving the fish deep.  In retro-spect we should have gone away from all the boat and worked it.  Nice to see you again.  I am going to get down when you guys are there for the get together, wish I could stay the weekend but at least a day so I hope I can meet a few of you then."
