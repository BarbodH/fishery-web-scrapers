I watched that video and knew right away what that guy had coming.  Granted that's some seriously thick ice, but come on.. think about what you are doing."
281891,irishfield,2008-12-20 04:46:00,26272,Reminds me... I need to get an extension shaft for my Jiffy (ya I know.. the wife already told you all that!). Ice is gonna be THICK this year! Already a foot plus at my dock I'm told... and it's -28C tonight. Last year we only had 10 to 12 inches of ice at best in Feb.
281894,ctdd2006,2008-12-20 04:56:00,531,.....cold for sure!   My beer froze tonight while working on the ice rink!  Ice will be thick and I too think I need to find an extension for my Jiffy!  Let me know if you find a good spot.
281897,douG,2008-12-20 05:10:00,2693,"Beats, ya, that's what burned em, the auger spinning in the hole which lead to the stomp and resulting screw up.  It looked like they were still short on the uh length, they had  bottomed out before at the beginning of the clip.  It was still hilarious - ""I told  you the manual crank is the way to go""."
281962,BassAsin,2008-12-20 14:34:00,806,if this weather keeps up wayne you may want to get 2 or 3 extensions for that jiffy!  
281968,johnnyb,2008-12-20 15:23:00,3413, I dunno...I seem to recall getting pretty tired with the hand auger out there last Feb...had to be more than 12 inches...I can't be that old already!
282048,fishindevil,2008-12-20 21:45:00,6254,"WOW...i wonder how far up north they were to have 5 ft of ice !!!!! man that would be some serious manual drilling thats for sure,  better have a good heart to do that, in a situation like that there is always DYNAMITE !!!!"
