281625,silverstreak,2008-12-19 17:31:00,146,River fishing has been tough lately so it was nice to finally find a fresh run of December chrome. Even managed to hit a bonus Brown. Didn't use a single roe sac as steelies and this Brown found a pink Riverworm to their liking. Cheers. 
281626,BassAsin,2008-12-19 17:33:00,806,nice report and a gorgeous lookin' fish! keep em' comin
281628,Leecher,2008-12-19 17:35:00,7832,Great report and pics silverstreak  Beautiful colors on that brown.... Congratulations Thanks for sharing Leechman
281631,jdmls,2008-12-19 17:39:00,575,funny I can only get them to hit the powerworms ... Those Riverwood's just don't give as much action compared to the powerworms IMO...Good to see you got some on them..
281633,solopaddler,2008-12-19 17:42:00,8605, Nice brown!  I've always found that the products I make and market work best as well.
281638,muskeybugged,2008-12-19 17:46:00,282,Nice photography or Gorgeous fish? A bit of Both.  Good job!
281641,silverstreak,2008-12-19 17:52:00,146,Here's a chunk of steel that also hit a Pink Riverworm. Hey solo......did you want me to lie and say it was caught on a berkley worm? Anyhow it was a great day for artificials.To bad about all the blood on the snow though. Lord knows what we would do if we couldn't use roe. 
281643,solopaddler,2008-12-19 18:00:00,8605," No...don't lie, but be a little more upfront with what you're trying to do.   I personally love all of your products and use them regularly and from what I've been told you're a decent guy as well... it's just that your posts are bordering on spam. (In a subtle way  )"
281644,BillM,2008-12-19 18:03:00,17367,"Nice fish!!!!  What was the blood all over the bank for?  Last time I checked,  fish don't bleed when you milk them...."
281674,silverstreak,2008-12-19 19:21:00,146,OK boy's I don't want this to turn into a pissing match. Solo......Point taken however product names are used everyday. Billy.....careful. Round one with the driveway now complete. I love snow just not shovelling. Cheers.
281743,fishindevil,2008-12-19 23:00:00,6254,"Nice brown & some winter steel you got there !!!.  ..pink roe bags were always my favourite color too,the company that made the spawnee,roe tying machine used to make a dull pink color mesh,and other than fishing in dirty water,it was the best overall color hands down !!!!   i wonder if they still make that color,as i dont do much trib fishin anymore cause of my screwed up back ....cheers"
