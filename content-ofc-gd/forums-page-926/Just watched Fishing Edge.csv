281093,BUSTER,2008-12-18 12:14:00,1336,"Would it bother you if during my fishing show i took a minute to slip in a speech about the almight head of cabbage that i pray and worship too?    ummmm that would be a no , i am sure you dont want to here about how this head of cabbage has changed my life and if you accept this head of cabbage your life will change too....it's a fishing show not gods fishing edge by AL?   now i really want you to know i like Al and have watched the show, however like i said. If i thought cabbage was my lord would you want me to talk about it during a fishing show and say you should embrace my head of cabbage into your life? you'd think i was a NUT.    stick to the fishing and keep your religous thoughts to yourself..  oh by the way i was raised roman cath.  alter boy when i was a kid, church and religion thru school years , and no i do not practice, nor do i force my kids to believe in almighty head of cabbage.....back to fishing talk.."
281113,Greencoachdog,2008-12-18 13:40:00,8163,I hate cabbage worshippers!!!  I prefer to worship the almighty Rutabaga instead!!!   ... there is only ONE Rutabaga!!!   PTR!!!
281182,bukee,2008-12-18 18:29:00,58,HAHA...good one RAF.
281211,kill n grill,2008-12-18 19:36:00,9,"Why all the fuss about Jesus and God? I hear it quite often and wonder why do they continue to persecute the Lord. I don't hear people squaking about other faiths-- OUT loud.  Al, keep up the good work brother and I will meet you in heaven worshipping our Lord and Saviour  Merry CHRISTmas,"
281213,fishingisliving,2008-12-18 19:38:00,170," Dave Mercer's Facts of fishing would be close to it. Dave is all about the excitement of fishing. If he is fishing for small walleyes you see him pull up small walleyes, if he is catching big lakers.. then you see the big ones and the small ones.  I dont pretend to know what goes on in the editing room but this show feels like it is showing legitimate times on the water and the fish are not trophies at every cast... it has a very realistic feel to it.  But so did Saving Private Ryan...  :-)"
281223,fishermccann,2008-12-18 20:20:00,655,"If you keep your god away out of this fishing site I will keep my tooth fairy, easter bunny,santa out as  well!!!!"
281229,Rich,2008-12-18 21:03:00,3927,Praise cabbage.
281231,The Urban Fisherman,2008-12-18 21:07:00,2050," Thanks Fil - I know exactly what goes on in the editing room seeing as I'm the editor of the show!    I'll tell you what if you know anybody who wants a part time job counting Dave's casts and such let me know!!!   haha  On those tough-bite days, they sure do add up! It's not so bad though -  all part of the job!"
281289,Greencoachdog,2008-12-18 23:38:00,8163,"  I feel that ones faith should be private and kept to themselves... I don't need to be ""saved"", converted, or imbued in others religious beliefs!!!  Some Christians can be the most obnoxious of all faiths, that's why they get knocked on!... remember the hari krishna's of yesteryear, did you appreciate them trying to push their religion on you?  Ok, with all that said... let me explain to you why Scientology is important to me!!!"
281432,Markystang,2008-12-19 03:32:00,131,I've got no problem with Al's little sermon. It takes up maybe 30 seconds at the end of the show. Big deal. Great show though. Those boys are definitely doing something right on the water.
281456,silvio,2008-12-19 04:50:00,433,"Nothing wrong his religious segments of the show. honestly if your going to get heated up about a little religious talk then don’t watch the show. one day there will come a time when your in despite need of help, and someone you need to turn to, to give you hope.  Now weather its Buddha, Jesus, Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu or any others it doesn't matter. I had to sit through a world religion class last semester and learn about every religion in the world and I was not offended at all, I found it interesting.  And if Christians are annoying at times then what are Jehovah witness that ring my door bell Sunday morning and give me a brochure in every language possible? in the end there just expressing what they believe in and that’s all.  If your going to get heated up over a little religious talk then you got to much time on your hands, its one thing not to agree or like it but to get mad over it is ridiculous."
281458,danbo,2008-12-19 05:36:00,2646,All these Shows are aired to Entertain & teach you. If it doesn't..change the Channel & go back to your vegetating..
280630,Cudz,2008-12-17 02:36:00,2652,Does Lindner use some kind of a convex lens on his cameras because every fish on that show seems to be huge.  Maybe it is just the way they hold the fish but I am always amazed at the size of the fish.  They are good fishermen and it doesn't hurt having God on your side but seriously they seem to catch big fish all the time.
280757,Rich,2008-12-17 12:02:00,3927,That's what happens when you're fishing 300 days out of the year for 30 years
280770,holdfast,2008-12-17 12:56:00,1813,"Yup, as far as I can remember he pioneered the stretched camera optical illusions.  Most shows do it and you'll even see it here with the pics.  That's why I always use either a Reel or something to give the size some relativity as I don't weigh them"
280775,Greencoachdog,2008-12-17 13:32:00,8163,Could a guide and editing 80 hrs of fishing into a 20 minute show have anything to do with it?
280777,bucktail,2008-12-17 13:38:00,1857,He has EXTREMELY long arms!!
280779,Mike Pike,2008-12-17 13:47:00,1332,"All that aside, it is my favorite fishin' show!  ""I don't care what bady of wada you're fishin' an.""  lol"
280793,The Urban Fisherman,2008-12-17 14:33:00,2050," well if it takes somebody like Linder 80 hours to shoot a show then they're doing something wrong because our average shoots are 2 to 5 hours with the odd day that goes sun - up to sun - down on a tough bite.... and if you do the math on a 13 episode shoot it'd take 130 days to shoot a season's worth of shows...which wouldn't be very cost effective at all! lol  Being an editor myself, I sure wouldn't want to sift through 160hrs (2 camera angles) of footage for each episode.  I doubt I'd have time to finish editing a season in time!  I'm just buggin' ya GCD - but either way, there's no denying that Linder know's his stuff, his show is of top notch production quality, as it should be with as many years that he's been in production, and I'm sure if we did a poll on OFC his show would be right up there in the rankings....  Cheers, UF"
280799,Greencoachdog,2008-12-17 14:54:00,8163," HA! I knew I could get a rise out of you Urby!!!   ... so when are we going to see the ""We got Skunked"" show???"
280800,forrest,2008-12-17 14:54:00,1032,Guide (tips) + prefish + good fishing guy = caught fish.  Oh and in the case of some: -snagging -rehooking fish
280803,Greencoachdog,2008-12-17 15:07:00,8163, ... but how do they go from a blue shirt and khaki pants before the commercial and green shirt and blue jeans after the commercial... do they change in the boat???
280808,forrest,2008-12-17 15:25:00,1032, I guess I have not seen as many different shows or maybe those are the olde tyme shows where the camera was not on for the full 12 hours of the day.  From the few I have seen most are shot over a 1 day period or they explain that they are shooting over X number of days.  Speaking of Olde Tyme shows...just how old are you GCD?...are you refferring to Red Fisher?  forrest
280815,Greencoachdog,2008-12-17 15:48:00,8163,"My birth date is in my profile forrest....  I've seen this on several different shows, they bank on people not remembering after their mind has been polluted with the fishing propaganda that supports these shows. Make a mental note of the attire the next time you watch any fishin' show."
280820,chickenhawk,2008-12-17 15:57:00,612,GCD is right.....but then again the good shows will explain that they are filming over a number of days....
280823,The Urban Fisherman,2008-12-17 16:07:00,2050,"I watch WFN alot, and I honestly can't name a recently made, credible show, that has done that without mentioning somewhere that it's a different day of fishing, and usually a different species..."
280829,TennesseeGuy,2008-12-17 16:19:00,957,The Lindners can catch fish.  Others can as well.
280830,Grimace,2008-12-17 16:22:00,2020,"Al is the man.   If anyone can outfish him and put on a show, go ahead.  I am not a fan of his god stuff but that doesn't matter.  He is a legend.   I don't like it when people sit back on there couch and cut up the people who are out there doing it.  Al has put a great show together for decades and now most recently with this one.  He started in fisherman and has carved out a great living and quite a little legacy out of doing something that we all love.   I am pretty sure if ya went up to lake of the woods with Al Lindner, Doug Stange, Gord Pyzer and Dick Pearson for a fishing trip those boys wouldn't have to change there clothes too often between fish."
280878,BUSTER,2008-12-17 20:12:00,1336,"I can do without the god stuff too,same as that hunting show on wildtv"
280881,Raf,2008-12-17 20:23:00,3495,al can practically walk on water
280882,TennesseeGuy,2008-12-17 20:27:00,957, Does that mean he can't part it?
280887,Raf,2008-12-17 20:38:00,3495,  he got in trouble for that  
280913,Cudz,2008-12-17 21:51:00,2652,I like the God part of the show.  Does not offend me at all.
280920,Roger_Dodger,2008-12-17 22:18:00,9,"when you have the time & resources that they do, your gonna catch lots of quality fish  not trying to derail this thread, but i have no probelm at all with Al taking 20 seconds or so to share his faith"
280924,Radnine,2008-12-17 22:31:00,1538,"Cudz, Is this not a bit of the pot calling the kettle black? I mean what is that, about a 12 pound smallie in your avatar? Jim"
280939,Cudz,2008-12-17 22:56:00,2652,lol.  7 pounds
281084,SlowPoke,2008-12-18 08:08:00,2984," Agree. I'm not a religious person but I don't tune out at that portion of the show. It's very tastefully done, well thought out and performed with good intentions. I don't know why anyone would be offended by it.  In my opinion, one of the best fishing shows on air - and it should be given their budget!  Here's the camera and crew...    The camera boat...    And the underwater team...  "
