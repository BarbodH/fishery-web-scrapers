278139,alexmedic,2008-12-11 02:53:00,186,"Just wondering if any one can recommend a good lodge to fish at for the upcoming season (4 night stay).  Usually we are a group of 15 or so, and like to travel say no more than 5-6 hours from Barrie.  We are very flexible with the species of fish, we just like them to bite!!  Since we want to fish and not cook, An American plan is a must.  Thanks!!"
278152,Riparian,2008-12-11 03:45:00,269,"there are many lodges available. I cant recomend any that I havent been to but my advice to you is to use google earth. Choose an area that is in your travel zone and start googleing the nearest city or town with the keywords lodge, fishing, cabin, etc.  You will find what you need. There are few poor ones out there. Most lodge owners value your business and will treat you well, but no lodge operator can guarantee you fish.  Good luck!"
