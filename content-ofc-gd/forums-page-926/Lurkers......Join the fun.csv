281121,blaque,2008-12-18 14:12:00,2419,"I notice on many occasions the ""guests"" vs. the members online is almost a 2 to 1 ratio.  This morning there were 135 people browsing the forum.......89 were guests, and 46 were members.  COME ON IN GUYS, sign up, . By the time you got done surfing here this morning , you could have been signed in and taking part in the conversations...."
281125,Roy,2008-12-18 14:58:00,13728,"I hear ya Blaque. Lots of guests. A large portion of those guests are actually Google, Yahoo etc... type spiders looking for data. The rest are lurkers who eventually register."
281137,Beans,2008-12-18 15:42:00,3339,"I wonder how many ""guests "" are guys like me that clear their ''cache"" every time they look up their bank info which in turn books us out of here and miss signing back in next time...???"
281139,carp-starter,2008-12-18 15:56:00,253,"The time right now is 10:42am and the numbers have gone up.  128 guests, 72 members, 0 anonymous members  Lurker or not means nothing to me but maybe ""total members"" does to forums sites. I do not know.  You know how some of the members are - they like to post worthless posts just to increase the totals for the number of posts they have posted. Or maybe nothing better to do?  What I would like to know and ask is - DOES ANY ONE WORK? I mean, it is now 10:48am. Or, are some at work and playing on company time? 200 people online is a high number.  Thank you - carp-starter  the totals are now up again -  128 guests, 75 members, 0 anonymous members"
281140,blaque,2008-12-18 16:01:00,2419," Well, at least somebodies thinkin this morning, that never crossed my mind bean.........but you are totally right. I do the same (clear out my cache many times a day) and dont realize i am on as a guest every morning till i find something to respond to or go to start a new thread and realize i am not signed in. Good point."
281141,shane,2008-12-18 16:02:00,652,I used to get signed in automatically every time I came to this site but then something changed and it doesn't do that anymore.  So I only log in if I want to post  Same thing has happened on other sites but some sites still remember me.  Strange.  Stupid computers.
281143,blaque,2008-12-18 16:04:00,2419, I am indeed at work........i wouldnt get thru a day at the office without comin on and reading something about a fish being caught. lol
281144,blaque,2008-12-18 16:06:00,2419,"lets see what happens on lunch break, the numbers should go thru the roof lol"
281301,Kerry,2008-12-19 00:01:00,383,If I'm browsing while on IE I'm lurking less I log in.If I'm browsing on Firefox I'm always logged in. Kerry
281318,MarcusDiGiovanni,2008-12-19 00:37:00,182,"LOL,  I used to be a lurker, however I changed my ways and got in on the action"
281362,irishfield,2008-12-19 01:46:00,26272,"Many are members at work who don't want the boss, who's also browsing, to see that they're on OFC and not dealing with customers!  Others are people that have been banned... or told us to stuff it etc.. yet still have to get their daily fix !!!"
281375,JohnF,2008-12-19 02:06:00,3494, I have my computer open on my desk and online all day long for work. But since I have the attention span of a 3 year old I keep getting distracted from my work. I suspect I may be pretty typical of OFNers in that regard. If we could stay focused on our work we'd probably rule the world.  JF
281514,diggyj,2008-12-19 13:48:00,548,Long time lurker!  Just signed up!  Dirk......

281692,JohnF,2008-12-19 20:24:00,3494," Well, there goes yer chance at ruling the world. Hopefully, fer your sake, you can't get at a computer at work.  JF"
281742,fishindevil,2008-12-19 22:54:00,6254,"Ya i guess im guilty as well,i usually end up not signing out either !!!   and will surf from work too,but at work all the so called chat sites are automatically blocked,so at work all i can do is just surf,so one of those lurkers are me !!!!..LOL..LOL..  cheers"
