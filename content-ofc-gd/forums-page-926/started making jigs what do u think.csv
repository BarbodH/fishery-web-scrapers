274776,Wild,2008-12-03 01:48:00,704,Can't see the jigs too well they look a little fuzzy

274791,danbo,2008-12-03 02:10:00,2646,Kewl..ya can add some flashabou strands for sparkle too. Here's  a neat link..  http://jigssalmonsteelhead.com/jig-fishing.htm
274802,GoneFishin,2008-12-03 02:37:00,349,"They look nice, I do see something wrong though (at least to me) could be fine though, but I always attach the bead with a small nail through the bead tied onto the hook."

274819,Leecher,2008-12-03 03:09:00,7832,Great job bigredfisher Those really look nice
274836,kemper,2008-12-03 03:44:00,2232,"good start, next batch try slipping a pin through the bead head, and then tying the pin onto the shank of the hook. It makes for a cleaner look (although I really doubt the fish car)  Keep it up!"
275092,PERCHER,2008-12-03 21:39:00,787,Nice job.They would be nice to have out on simcoe this winter.Keep up the good work.
275126,motv8tr,2008-12-03 22:42:00,2587,It's what the fish think that matters most  Look good to me though Maureen
275336,chickenhawk,2008-12-04 12:18:00,612,if i were a steelhead....i'd eat them....    Hawk
275337,singingdog,2008-12-04 12:19:00,1047," Jigs are supposed to be fuzzy  Nice ties bigred. The fish don't care where the beads are. Personally, I put them on the way you did...one less step."
275339,tributaryhunter,2008-12-04 12:36:00,108,"very nice looking jigs, now go out and try them lol"
275340,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-04 12:40:00,3761,"Nice job man, they look prett good to me."

275659,moparhawk,2008-12-05 02:51:00,146,this is just wrong if it took
282063,profisher25,2008-12-20 22:12:00,185,"impressive!, have you ever tried making hard bait lures.. ill tell ya, its a long process, but its fun making em. I make lots of topwater baits, easiest to make in my opinion, you should try it!"
