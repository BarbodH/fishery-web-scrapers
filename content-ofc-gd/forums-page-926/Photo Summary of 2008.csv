279327,Ramble,2008-12-14 07:55:00,713," Well i was gonna write a bunch of stuff and slap the pictures into it, but I decided against it. I played around in photobucket for a while and made up this bad boy. It's all photos from this year. (Takes a minute to load)  http://s236.photobucket.com/albums/ff314/g...nt=871e4304.pbr  I had 2 great trips with my dad too Algonquin, good times with my fishing buddies and had an absolute blast at Kesagami. There is only a couple K-Sawg photos in the line up.  The bulk of them are waiting for the report I'm going to write. I even stuck in a picture of the doe I dropped this fall. It ends with ice fishing photos from last winter....I can hardly wait to get out on the hard water this year.  The pic's are in no particular order, and i slipped some scenery and wildlife shots into the mix.  It's about 4:30 long, and probably take you less time to watch then reading an actual report of my year if i had written one. The song is the best i could come up with from the limited selection they offer.  Hope you enjoy it.  -R-  "

Matt!"
