This isn't the case today, but I wonder if the blowing snow has got in some place? I don't give a rat's butt about the alarm, but I (and I'm sure my neighbours) don't want it going off all the time. Can disable it? Nothing in the owners manual about that.  Ideas?"
281864,SlowPoke,2008-12-20 03:32:00,2984,"Bummer! My Tahoe has been acting up lately. The drivers side rear door lock mechinism freezes and only partially engages or disengages the lock. When the vehicle is warm, no problem. Is there a chance it could have condensation/freezing issues? If you can keep it warm overnight and try to recreate the problem, you might have a direction to follow. -Brian"

281942,e-z-out,2008-12-20 12:54:00,1052,What year is the car make and modle? I myself ran into the same problem a few years ago. My alarm was always going off after i locked the car. Tured out that my swich the one that is mounted on the door itself had rust build up and had to be sanded down and hit with some WD40. Never gave me problems after that.  You might want to look into that first. could be an eazy fix
