281603,paul_614,2008-12-19 16:49:00,168,You could call Valens.  
281616,bigugli,2008-12-19 17:01:00,6138,Most of the ponds I know in Niagara had lost most of their ice with the rain.  Nothing safe to my knowledge.
281632,iceslayer,2008-12-19 17:40:00,97,I'll find out if there is ice on Valens.  Anyone wanna fish it on Sunday??
281635,iceslayer,2008-12-19 17:45:00,97,"Oh yeah!!!!   5"" solid ice.   Who's in??  I've never fished it before and would love to try it.     Cheers!"
