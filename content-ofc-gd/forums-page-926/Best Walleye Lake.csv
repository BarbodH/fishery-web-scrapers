278520,Zubris21,2008-12-12 02:01:00,563,"sounds like your pretty firm on wanting a small lake, but I'll mention this anyways.  The St. Lawrence River has some excellent walleye fishing in the Iroquois/Morrisburg area.  Had many days with 40ish fish boated and always get some size in there.  I'd say the average is about 3lbs with the bigguns we've caught going up to 12+.  Plus since its a major water body there are always some decent pike mixed in there.  PM me if you want more specifics on locations/techniques."
278892,Reelpro,2008-12-13 01:06:00,73,"  The stats they publish are pretty much based on what people keep, not what they actually catch. They are also based on voluntary reporting, so unfortunately there is a fair bit of crap.  Check out Lac Pin Blanc, or Watch, or Du Fils.  I have fished them all dozens of times - worst miserable cold front day on the water was still about a 20 walleye day. Normal days are 50 to 100 walleye Per angler. YUP Jammed with em.  Cheers Mike "
278919,Tomcat,2008-12-13 02:03:00,395,"Hi Mike:  Thanks for replying to my post. You made a good point about how records are kept within the ZECs. Its truly sad that some fishermen seem reluctant to accurately report their catches to fish biologists trying to manage the resource.  Anyway, for the lakes you mentioned, according to the 2005 harvest stats, for Pin Blanc, 770 walleye were reported harvested during 638 fishing days (number of fishermen X number of days fished) for an average success rate of 1.21. Similarly, for Lac du Fils, 2399 walleye were harvested during 1953 fishing days for an average success rate of 1.23. There were no stats reported in 2005 for Lac Watch.  Continued success with your walleye fishing in la belle provence. My walleye fishing is in the same general area of Quebec (e.g. Lac Kipawa, Lac Ogascanane, Lac Sasseginaga and Lac Truit).  Jay"

272198,Stoty,2008-11-26 17:23:00,2910,"Hey everyone,  Just wondering what the best lake would be to hook into some good walleye. We would be looking for size and numbers, either is fine....ideally with the best shot at both.  We are in Cobourg (30 mins east of Oshawa), and are looking to drive about 4-6 hrs.  Any input would be greatly appreciated."
272199,Stoty,2008-11-26 17:25:00,2910,(Besides the Bay of Quinte)
272205,jwl,2008-11-26 17:44:00,1056,4-6 hours from there.........summer.....Lake Erie
272210,Stoty,2008-11-26 18:00:00,2910,Quebec is also an option.  We are hoping for smaller lakes...Erie is too big.
272226,hirk,2008-11-26 18:55:00,571,Rice but you already knew that  BTW nice tank your holding buddy
272235,bigbuck,2008-11-26 19:10:00,2449,"What about Nippissing?? Mind you, if you're willing to travel, keep going North, the further the better."
272238,Stoty,2008-11-26 19:15:00,2910,"Ya, we are willing to head a little further north than that. Know of any good smaller lakes?"
272247,LeXXington,2008-11-26 19:38:00,1928,  Agree  Lake St Clair in the spring
272280,Trevor0179,2008-11-26 21:05:00,65,YOU SHOLUD TRY LAKE NIPPISING IN THE NORTH BAY AREA  CHEERS

272312,fishindevil,2008-11-26 22:50:00,6254,"Well i think the best thing to do,is go on-line,and start checking out different areas,and pick one where you want to go,and then call local baitshops talk to people that have fished the area,and then get a map and start by getting a game plan,on when is the best time,and the best lake that will put the odds in your favor !!!!i have been doing that for years,and have found some amazing fishing spots,and met great people,and fished alot of areas in this great province,in other words do some homework,and it will help you more that you will believe !!!! cheers"

272408,brkygetr,2008-11-27 01:11:00,425, Agreed...good lake. Though I would east past Shining Tree. Though more than 6 hours...unless your a Nascar driver and a wee crazy....the #144 is a crazy highway.
272433,Stoty,2008-11-27 02:13:00,2910,"Where is this ""Bicscotasing"" Lake?"
272440,pike slayer,2008-11-27 02:35:00,1177,just go all out and do the drive to like the chapleau area or somewhere good like that.
272441,irishfield,2008-11-27 02:37:00,26272,Take a map of Northern Ontario/Quebec and throw a dart at it Stoty !
272450,Stoty,2008-11-27 02:54:00,2910,Hahaha
278319,Stoty,2008-12-11 18:04:00,2910,"We are thinking about the area just NE of North Bay (Temiscaming, QC). I'm assuming that walleye/pike are in all the lakes up in that area, correct me if I'm wrong though. Does anyone know of any good lakes there that we would be able to camp on? All the places I am finding are lodges that charge $400 for a 3-night trip."
278345,highdrifter,2008-12-11 19:09:00,2534," Temiscaming's a great lake, but it might be a little big if you're prospecting..  If someone doesn't physically put you onto fish, you may cover alot of water, just to be casting in oblivion..  Have you considered, Lady Evelyn?  It's not far from Temiskaming. It's mostly provincial park, so you can count on there being lotsa good camping spots, motor boats are also permitted, and the fishing is great in early spring.. Also, it's a breathtaking part of the province!!  PM me brotha.  HD"
278374,The Urban Fisherman,2008-12-11 20:51:00,2050," lol that's funny stuff irish.....  Lady Evelyn is a nice lake for sure, but you'll want some charts so you don't bottom out as I believe it was a flooded reservoir once upon a time, with plenty of underwater structure to hit.....and from my experience it's a live bait lake...tough bite without dem der' minnow's...  Cheers, UF"
278390,Stoty,2008-12-11 21:21:00,2910,Oh really?? Thanks for the heads up!
278402,Handlebarz,2008-12-11 21:45:00,3790,Tomiko has some very nice fishing there you can find some huge eyes also. As for lodging you can not go wrong with Tomiko lake lodge Lisa is a very nice person and will treat you right the prices are very good but you will need to bring bedding and a BBQ here is a link to there place and you are with in 2 min for pickerel fishing or right off the dock works well also. This is just north of Stergeion Falls so if yer there at teh right time you can always bust down the door of the Big Boss and if yer lucky you can get to see Tj also. I have fished this lake twice and will be back again for sure.  http://www.tomikolakelodge.com/products.html
278407,highdrifter,2008-12-11 22:02:00,2534," That's true.  Proceed up Lady Evelyn river with caution dude.  The route I mentioned in my PM.  Fishing is way better in the spring when you can still find em in the shallows.  I went up last year in mid August, so only the lodges seemed to put people onto bigger fish..  Minnows are allowed, but worms work really well..  Don't forget your crankbaits, I caught more fish on them then anything else.  HD"
278427,Reelpro,2008-12-11 23:03:00,73,"Hey Stoty  If your interested in Temiskaming area. You need to go to the Zec Restigo.  If you want 100 plus walleye days, and a shot at a 15lb Walleye. That's where you want to go.  It's a few more bucks, as you need a Quebec lisense and you pay the Zec by the day, but there are dozens of beautiful empty lake you can camp on. They are all JAMMED full of walleye. Lots of Pike too, with 30LB plus Pike caught every yr.  If you want more details drop me an email."
278511,Tomcat,2008-12-12 01:46:00,395," Just a question  I took a look at the latest harvest statistics I have (2005) for ZEC Restigo. According to those harvest statistics, if there are any lakes in the ZEC JAMMED full of walleye, I guess they weren't biting in 2005. The best ZEC Restigo walleye harvest stat in 2005 was 1.53 walleye per fishing day on Lake Restigo. Has the ZEC opened some different walleye lakes since 2005 where the walleye fishing is better? I'll have to send away for the latest stats."
