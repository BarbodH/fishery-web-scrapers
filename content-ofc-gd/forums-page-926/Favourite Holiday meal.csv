281799,Rich,2008-12-20 01:04:00,3927,Hate to say I eat prime rib so often it's nothin' special anymore.  I'll be having the classic turkey & fixin's. Though I've always been a bigger fan of Christmas ham.
282023,Billy Bob,2008-12-20 19:05:00,5865," I have to agree with you, dry aged beef especially prime rib is the best roast out there.  I do something similar and recommend this for anyone else that likes prime rib. Get a Standing Rib Roast, it's the same as prime rib but still has the bone in it. MOST butchers have this cut of meat as a standard selection. Rub it with kosher salt, pepper and some garlic powder. Roast in the oven (can't remember the temp off hand) until it reaches between 138 -140 degrees. Let it rest for at least 1/2 hour and slice it so every piece has a bone in it or you can slice it thinner so every other piece has a bone in it. I REALLY believe that the bone adds a lot of flavor to the meat. If you remove the bone prior to cooking you have yourself a piece of prime rib ready to cook.  BTW I did a standing rib roast this past summer on a charcoal grill and it turn out the best roast I every did.   We will be dining on Christmas Eve in our home with a five course meal. Here is our menu for Wed.   * Fresh cooked Shrimp cocktail chilled on ice with homemade cocktail sauce. (if you never cooked raw shrimp and chilled it for shrimp cocktail you don't know what you are missing. The frozen already cooked shrimp is soft a mushy compared to cooking it yourself for only 5 minutes)  * Homemade mushroom soup  * Caesar Salad  * Slow Roasted Prime Rib with the bone still in (Standing Rib Roast)  *Chocolate moose for dessert  *** A nice nap to let all that food process so I can indulge in Christmas cookies later   Merry Christmas everyone and a Happy New on the water,  Bob"
281331,bigugli,2008-12-19 00:54:00,6138," Because our Christmas is a month long celebration, it is difficult to list all the food we will stuff ourselves with. Might need a couple of pages.  Dec. 6th was an open house with sil, swedish meatballs, devilled eggs, slaw, potato salad, pickled everything, and a mountain of fish. Desert was trifle, ice cream cake and X-mas cookies.  Tonight we have roast beef, baked chicken, baked squash,  creamed peas, boiled new potatoes.  and in the week up to Christmas there is a special dish every day.  Prime rib on the 25th. Turkey on the 26th. and a glazed ham Jan 1st."
281340,irishfield,2008-12-19 01:14:00,26272, exactly Larry...even if it's dry and sticks to the roof of your mouth!
281346,jwl,2008-12-19 01:19:00,1056,"  if you folks are down my way again like last year on Boxing Day...don't be shy, bring the Ugli's and stop on into the mad house"
281349,fishinfool,2008-12-19 01:24:00,366,"Hey fil where can I buy a good dry aged Prime Rib Roast? I have been looking for a good butcher for years with no luck. I live in Ajax, anyone know a good butcher?"
281417,highdrifter,2008-12-19 03:16:00,2534," Tanya just corrected me about the carp.  Apparently, it's boiled, then stuffed.. and then baked..  Doesn't that just sounds scrump-diddly-umptious?!!  I think I'll have another cabbage roll, spasibo!!  What about your missus dawg?  Anything cajun?!"
281442,Greencoachdog,2008-12-19 03:43:00,8163,"I suspect it's going to be a Honey Baked Ham, greenbean casserole, simmered yellow squash, sweet potatoes, and spiced apples.  Nothing real lavish... pretty tame actually, but I'll take it any day of the week!!!"
281444,sturgman,2008-12-19 03:47:00,249, Sounds mightty Yummy to me Glen!! The green bean casserole sounds yummy!!
