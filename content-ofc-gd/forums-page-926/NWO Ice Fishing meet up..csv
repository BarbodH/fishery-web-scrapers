280819,limeyangler,2008-12-17 15:57:00,5204,"  Excellent Rickster!  looking forward to our earlier trip just after Xmas, i'll be working on xmas day and Boxing day, so we might wanna sort out the details before then.   Cheers mate   Simon."
281749,limeyangler,2008-12-19 23:06:00,5204,"Hey Guys,  we're getting there!!!   So far we've got Brkygetr, BenBeattie and Rickster from OFC.   I've also been enlisting from an Ice Fishing forum i visit and there are another 5 guys who say definitely coming as far as possible, and 2 more maybes.    So as it stands we have a possible 11 signed up including lil' ole me. I know some of my buddies want to come who are not members of either forums, so thats another 3 or 4.   Guess we should start thinking about venues etc pretty soon."
280116,limeyangler,2008-12-16 03:04:00,5204,"Hi Y'all.   I see all these great Lakair and other similar get togethers happening but they all seem to be way south of us up here. I would really like to arrange something like that for the NWO contingent of OFC, thats not to say all are not welcome   I have been in contact with around 4 members already from the area....1 definitely up for it, waiting replies from others, but if your interested please reply to this post so we can start the list and work on the where, who, when...lol why.....of it all.   There are some NWO members of an ice fishing forum i frequent already interested so we could have around 10 people already once yo include family, friends and pets...lol    Look forward to lots of replies hopefully, but even a few would be fun.    Thanks   Simon"
280123,Joey,2008-12-16 03:11:00,9122,"Hmmmm, wonder if Wayne is busy, maybe we could all book a flight up  Sounds like it would be a blast Simon.  That's pretty dang far tho.  Joey"
280124,irishfield,2008-12-16 03:13:00,26272,Joey !  Good luck Simon putting this together. Always fun.
280126,Bernie,2008-12-16 03:15:00,3190, I bet the fishing would be great Joey! On the other hand it's probably about the same distance to GCD's Southern home.
280129,limeyangler,2008-12-16 03:31:00,5204,  LOL..i dont think Glen would come...he'd have to wear at least a T-Shirt....lol
280150,Sinker,2008-12-16 04:47:00,8692,How far would that be driving?  Just curious........I have 14 days off coming up. Hows the whitie fishing up there  Sinker
280159,limeyangler,2008-12-16 05:08:00,5204,"  Hey Sinker,   its a good days drive if you try and do it in one haul...but i did that once....best to do it in 2 days.   I'm heading out on saturday for whities, i'll post a report. Will be doing a lot more whitie fishing after january as most of the whitie lakes are trout lakes...trout not open till Jan1st....just avoids any hassles and harm to fish out of season...as you will always get trout while fishing whities."
280250,Leecher,2008-12-16 16:04:00,7832," Hey Simon, that sounds like a good idea but for me it's a long drive to go up there.  Just did a quick search in Google maps and Dryden is 1799Km's from Gatineau and would take roughly 22 hours to drive out  I don't think I'll be joining this year Jacques"
280293,TennesseeGuy,2008-12-16 17:55:00,957,"Simon, a few of us can make about a 30 minute stop at the Dairy Queen in Dryden on May 15.  I met your neighbor, Skylane, there last May."
280301,limeyangler,2008-12-16 18:19:00,5204,"  hey TennesseeGuy, that would be cool, i'll put our order in now!"
280313,limeyangler,2008-12-16 18:38:00,5204,"Hey all,   Thanks for the replies so far.   The intention of this is not to be as big as lakair...or even like it actually, really wanted to meet and put faces to NWO members.....SO COME ON WHERE ARE YA!"
280316,danc,2008-12-16 18:44:00,4677,"I'm pretty much booked solid at work for the next 6 months Simon. Long hours with no end in sight, so I can't commit. Great idea though. I'd be more interested in a soft water meet up."
280323,Whopper,2008-12-16 19:05:00,2174,Connie you go to Dryden.....I usually take the scenic bypass
280324,brkygetr,2008-12-16 19:06:00,425,I'm in for sure...as long as were fishin whities or trout.... l have thought about this for a while as well. Glad you got the ball rollin' Simon. It's gonna be hard pickin a lake that is central but I am sure it will come tougether. Keep me informed and if you need any assistance just let me know.  brkygetr
280328,highdrifter,2008-12-16 19:15:00,2534,Ya know Simon...  Lakair was awesome... for the nightlife!!  I wanna catch me some eaters.   My father and I would love to come up.  What dates did you have in mind?  HD  GCDawg?!!  Where you is brotha?!
280344,Handlebarz,2008-12-16 19:47:00,3790,If I still lived in Sudbury that would be alot more doable but dang that sure is a far drive for a weekend LOL.  Hey Buster what do ya say to a good O'l road trip dang would be fun to do it all over again where did them days of Friday night pick a place and just go and not worry about how or when yer getting back.
280398,BUSTER,2008-12-16 21:38:00,1336,ahhh the days eh .....mr eh!   iam off starting this friday for 2 wks 3 work days to go!!!  cant wait  heading to sudzbury for some hardwater  .sorry but drydens a little far
280402,BUSTER,2008-12-16 21:40:00,1336,you know those fridays your talking about it seems to me i mooched a ride from you most of the time!
280426,limeyangler,2008-12-16 22:17:00,5204,"  Wow! Awesome Highdrifter. Would be great to ge ya ya up here.   The whole thing is early days yet.....watch this space and i'll update regularly...would like to go before february though, might be a March long weekend though to accomodate those who arent local though...who knows...we'll get a few more in numbers nd go from there.      Hey Dale, did i PM you...sorry if i didn't, you were definitely on the list , couldn't imagine you'd pass this up, great to have ya onboard!"
280433,highdrifter,2008-12-16 22:32:00,2534, Ahh gotcha.  That would make for an interesting g2g..  Looks like you know the lakes well..  But I'm thinking more of an opener or after opener kinda thing..  Dryden is a bit north for a vacation in February..  Somewhere south is called for when the temperature dips and my coco becomes a solid lump in my thermos .  Like the mediterranean!!  cheers HD
280521,brkygetr,2008-12-17 00:19:00,425,"Hey Simon...are you thinking a weekend deal where all who attend stay in one location or just a day event??? Just wondering as that would increase the oppertunities for different species and different lakes. I know there are lots o' camps, within reach of various lakes/species, that could accommodate a gathering of cold, hungry, thirsty fisher-people."
280638,limeyangler,2008-12-17 02:42:00,5204,"  Aaaaah...gotcha too HD, was kinda wonderin' about a trip all the way for a days fishing, but yeah...an opener up here would be fun, Joey jokingly suggested it, could be one for the future me thinks.....we are on 9 acres here by the lake...so plenty of room for campers/tents!!!!    Hold that thought HD!!!"
280645,limeyangler,2008-12-17 02:50:00,5204,"  Hey Dale,  Your thinking exactly the same thing i was just 10 minutes ago...your way ahead of me! a weekend would be great hey...like you said more species could be covered.   I was thinking of  letting this recruitment/sign up thread run until start of next week, then go with how many we have then , see where the majority are located/ do a vote for species preferred/ something like that to determine how this meet up will take place etc. Of course anyone can still sign up to come along after next week, but i think by then most of the NWO Members would be signed up...there's not that many of us it seems:unsure:    sound good?  please wade in with all suggestions as we go though, i'm gonna need help workin this all out.   Cheers    Simon."
280647,highdrifter,2008-12-17 02:51:00,2534, Will do Brah.  Keep us in the loop!!
280776,rickster,2008-12-17 13:32:00,495,Hey Simon  You can count me in and let me know if I can help at all. I will give you a call on boxing day and we can make  a plan for Sat or Sun trip  Rick
