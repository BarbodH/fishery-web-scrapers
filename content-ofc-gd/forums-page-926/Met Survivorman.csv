277549,bukee,2008-12-09 19:34:00,58," Already been done, it's called  ""Cops""........bad boy, bad boy, wha you gonna do.....haha."
277564,dp3200,2008-12-09 19:56:00,31,"I know I will take some heat for saying this, but doesn't anyone else think that Les Stroud is a complete joke? I laugh through most of the show at what this guy does.  ""It's critical that I don't get wet or I will freeze"" - 10 minutes later, he is fully clothed and knee deep in the water.  ""I can't eat the dogs meat because I need them to get out of here"" - 10 minutes later, what is he doing? Eating the meat.  Nothing he ever tries works. Hunting, fishing, building a raft. It fails virtually every time all the while he is lecturing you how to do this stuff... All he seems to do is sit by the fire and starve for the week. Well, SOMETIMES the week.. most of the time he doesn't even last that long!  Man vs. wild may be staged and more ""hollywood"" but at least he shares real valuable survival tips. Survivorman truly does not appear to have any idea what he is doing.  And before anyone says something - no - I do not think I am some survival superhero or something. I am not saying I could do a better job. I just think that Survivorman should be hosted by someone who can actually....survive."
277572,ch312,2008-12-09 20:21:00,1590," when it comes to survival, you do what you have to. urine will hydrate your body and climbing a wet cliff may be your only option. i dont think neither of the shows tell you to do something that would harm you in any way as long as you are careful.  survivorman is kinda boring and basic while man vs wild is more entertaining and more extreme. both of them are great shows.  one thing though...survivor man sure does need to get some of his ideas to actually work!"
277583,solopaddler,2008-12-09 20:38:00,8605," Speaking as someone who's spent long spells alone in the bush (4 months the longest) and have some skills in that area myself, I enjoy the show. Take it for what it is and nothing more, entertainment.  The biggest danger anyone faces being alone in the wild is fear. If you can overcome that you'll likely be fine. It's all mental..."
277784,nancur373,2008-12-10 02:21:00,1211," Well said. As far as I am concerned they both are actors. But I do believe Bear has some sorta Special Forces training. Did I mention Les pulled his kids out of school and organized sports to go live ""off-grid"". What a thing to do to adolescent children."
277813,holdfast,2008-12-10 04:09:00,1813," I agree also reference the Fear.  Also what I found out too is that you must have the survivor instinct.  I watched students ( NCOs and Officers) Bum out real quickly.  I found the person with the best attitude (Survivor Instinct) did well while the others not so well.  Yea and you could put out 20 Snares and you might be lucky to get one Rabbit.  As far as sitting around the fire, Fire lifts your spirits. As A Winter Warfare Instructor, I find Survivorman Entertaining and actually realistic.  Trust me, not everything you do and learn will work.  You have to work at it which he preaches.  As a Tidbit.  How many smokers, would Bum out knowing you only have one smoke left, but you are in a survival situation and your there for the long haul."
279920,TennesseeGuy,2008-12-15 16:57:00,957,"Check Les Stroud and the Pikes.  Same guy, making music.  Also a decent pike fisherman when he has proper fishing gear."
279932,forrest,2008-12-15 17:34:00,1032,"#Man vs. Wild is not fake.  They are very open about how the show is made.  There is always a crew and safety people around. #Survivorman is nuts...he has a search and rescue crew.  But, he could be eaten and turned into bear stool by the time they found him  the other thing I notice about Les Stroud is that he is a northern specialist.  In places like the Amazon he is out of his element.  He does manage to survive though"
282089,profisher25,2008-12-20 23:04:00,185,"Les is my hero! Survivorman is like the best show ever, one of my dads friends met him once, i wish i waas there"
282094,BassAsin,2008-12-20 23:09:00,806,"he's an excellent guy, playued hockey with him in new liskeard a few times in a mens leaugue hes not the greatest hockey player but very respectable one of a kind    true class he alos had a show caleed ""off the grid"" he and the whole family lived off thr grid and it was a pretty good show as well."
276765,Governator,2008-12-07 19:23:00,879,Met him at a book signing event in Barrie today (5min from my house).  Very cool guy - he seemed very professional and well spoken.  Just thought I'd share.     
276769,fishindevil,2008-12-07 19:31:00,6254,"Thats great !!! i watch his show all the time,and he is a very smart educated man for sure,and he really likes meeting people,and learning new things,and as we all know he is a true  Mc GYVER !!!!!"
276776,holdfast,2008-12-07 19:47:00,1813,I like his show in that he is his own cameraman.  I can really get under my Wife's skin when shes watching Survivor or Big Brother and i tell her that there is a camera crew around them with lights and makeup as well as a perimeter fence and the animal scenes are shot in a zoo.  Very Realistic!
276793,Skud,2008-12-07 20:22:00,739,where?
276794,Skud,2008-12-07 20:24:00,739,"Costco, 7 min from my house. Dang!"
276795,Governator,2008-12-07 20:25:00,879,"  Was at Costco on Mapleview dr.   I'm on survivormans newsletter list, so they sent mail mentioning the book signing a couple weeks ago.  Almost forgot, glad I marked it down lol."
276798,lew,2008-12-07 20:31:00,12767,"There's not a whole lot on TV that I like anymore, but Survivorman is an excellent show and one that I never miss. Watched the episode yesterday where he was stranded up in Alaska while doing a kayak trip.  I've been wanting to see him do an arctic show in the dead of winter but haven't seen anything like that yet but I think it would be really interesting."
276800,Bernie,2008-12-07 20:35:00,3190, Geez Lew. You just finished saying you liked the guy. And now you want to send him to the Arctic- in the winter?   Bit of a mean streak do ya?
276802,lew,2008-12-07 20:44:00,12767,"The guys got it too easy sometimes Bernie, just sittin in the warm woods waiting for the helicopter to come and get him, I just wanna see him really earn his money once in awhile"
276808,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-07 21:04:00,10439,"He did do a Nunavut snowmobile breakdown show that was pretty good even if it was filmed in April or May.   A January or February episode on the barrens would be nice to see, be hard to keep the cameras working though."
276845,Sinker,2008-12-07 23:36:00,8692,"I watch the show as well.  I'd really like to see him over turn a boat in cold water and survive. He'd need some good camera gear, but it sure would be interesting!!  Or how about a snowmobile breakdown when its actually winter and cold?  Sinker"
276848,irishfield,2008-12-07 23:40:00,26272," I guess he already did one better sinker when my buddy Peter dropped him off to fake the crashed airplane scenario in Temagami. Pretty sure Les wouldn't have made it out of that one if his helicopter hadn't picked him up when he ""timed out"".. while walking the wrong way down the lake .....he wasn't headed for town/highway etc!"
276849,Sinker,2008-12-07 23:45:00,8692,"  I watched that episode too. Not bad, but there were a few things I would have done different. I would have been eating rabbits everyday no problem.....I dunno how good of a trapper he is, but there were lots of rabbit tracks and he only got one or 2?? They've got to be the easiest thing to catch in the winter with a snare!!  I also would have set up my camp, and stayed put until someone found me. It makes no sense to travel in the winter if your lost......just set up shop, and stay put. Someone will get ya after a spell  Sinker"
276924,youngvedder,2008-12-08 02:10:00,72,"just finished watching his ""off The Grid"" episode....excellent show....would love to see a follow up to it to see how he is progressing.   great show!"
276926,nancur373,2008-12-08 02:28:00,1211,"Love his show. Like to see more episodes. Also, do you guys watch Man vs. Wild. Also very good show."
276933,Mattones,2008-12-08 02:38:00,587,You lucky guy! that would be awesome meeting him!
276938,fishing n autograph,2008-12-08 02:55:00,2540,"he's done a few ""winter"" style survival shows. The latest one was in Labrador and he was dog sledding along the ocean. It was cool...."
276967,Zubris21,2008-12-08 04:10:00,563,"  Survivorman is a great show!  Man vs. Wild on the other hand is not.  Often times he tells you do to things that are completely ridiculous in a survival situation.  Ex.  Drinking your own urine, or climbing up a cliff of slippery rocks right at a waterfall.   Also Bear Gryllis (man vs wild) has a camera crew with him and apparently spends his nights in resorts/hotels.  I saw The Hour about a year ago with Les Stroud on it and he basically criticized Bear and called him a fraud...  Need an example...  "
277070,bigbuck,2008-12-08 16:04:00,2449,"I'll second the Man vs. Wild fraud. The guy has a crew with him that I'm sure share some of their food and water. Mind you, he eats things that 'would make a billy goat puke' a la Rambo. Les Stroud on the other hand does it completely solo. Snaring rabbits may be easy when you have commercially available snares, he's doing it with a stick and a rock like the cavemen did. It does not get more realistic than that. It's a good show that people who spend time in the outdoors should watch on occasion to learn a few things."
277091,ricoboxing,2008-12-08 16:49:00,398,he should do an episode at Jane & Finch
277256,nancur373,2008-12-09 00:25:00,1211,"I'm not saying it is not fake. Just that he has some good survival tips. Also as much as i love watching Survivorman, don't you guys think Mr. Stroud is all he's cracked up to be either. He always has a safety crew just incase."
277421,Jer,2008-12-09 13:11:00,1426,"   ...well geez...it is just a TV show...nobody wants to see the guy die out there.  Then everybody would be sayin ""what an idiot, how could he go out there with no safeties in place?"""
277426,danbouck,2008-12-09 13:22:00,4380,He did an Alaska special that was great! He had all the gear plus a crew but he went into the water almost freezing to death to show how to get yourself out of broken ice.
277446,Governator,2008-12-09 14:55:00,879,"Les has a crew, but they are far away like 1-5km away at a camp.  He has  satellite phone to call in case of emergencies.  That still impressive imo and I feel like I learn something while watching his shows.  They might not be as exciting as man vs wild (Which is just hollywood) but they are addicting to watch for some reason."
277480,HUKDONFAWNIX,2008-12-09 16:38:00,135,Where can I find this book?  Indigo.ca says it will ship in 3-5 weeks.  I can't wait that long.
