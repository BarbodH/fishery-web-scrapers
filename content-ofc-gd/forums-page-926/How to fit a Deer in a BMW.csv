281809,Gerry,2008-12-20 01:27:00,257,"Wayne, nice Superbee. That picture makes me sorry for not keeping my beauty, 67 Plymouth GTX 440 convertible. That beast was fast and never could open it up because of the crappy tires we had back then. Of course, I'm lucky to be here today to talk about it  "
281814,Bernie,2008-12-20 01:40:00,3190,About 4 or 5 years ago one of my customers hit a beaver with a Sunfire. He wasn't a speeder. It still wracked up a $2800.99 bill by the time it was repaired.
281402,PatrickGG,2008-12-19 02:50:00,562,"Came Across this on the internet, Apparently this BMW was Doing 140MPH when the Impact occurred in Germany, Take about WOW! And oh yes it's a 150 pound Deer ""so they say""..     "
281403,Beats,2008-12-19 02:56:00,543,quality automobile.
281410,Leecher,2008-12-19 03:09:00,7832,OUCH
281420,BassAsin,2008-12-19 03:19:00,806,drop the hood and it would look like a little fender bender u could drive away from!
281424,Mattones,2008-12-19 03:23:00,587,how the hell...  Now that would be a site to see in person.
281427,sturgman,2008-12-19 03:28:00,249,Looks fishy to say the least
281428,irishfield,2008-12-19 03:29:00,26272,Pics been around a long time... I'd believe a fox !
281435,PatrickGG,2008-12-19 03:34:00,562,"I was kinda skeptical myself Irish, thats why i ended it off ""so they say"", 150 pounds of Deer would probably do more damage but than again 140 Mph is purty fast."
281436,irishfield,2008-12-19 03:36:00,26272,140 is just about the time your passenger gets his arms wrapped around the bottom of the bucket seat... 180 is when the telephone poles look like a picket fence! lol Ahhhhh the good ol' days !
281437,wuchikubo,2008-12-19 03:36:00,1114,"Looking at the pics of the fur, I'd more likely believe you too, the hair looks too long and softer than what a deer's coat resembles. Question is looking at the height of the impact and entry seems a bit higher than what a fox's level would be."
281439,irishfield,2008-12-19 03:39:00,26272,Well what ever it is Stan... it's DEAD !
281441,sturgman,2008-12-19 03:42:00,249,Gheese almost looks like a dog... Maybe a golden retriever
281445,Stoty,2008-12-19 03:47:00,2910,"I'd agree with a fox. A deer is just TOO big to ""fit"" (for lack of better word), through the grill. Maybe the fox saw it coming and tried to ""jump"" out of the way, when it was INHALED by the beemer.  But wait a sec........ a BMW going fast on the highway????? NO WAY!!!!!!!! HOAX!!!!"
281448,bigugli,2008-12-19 03:58:00,6138,"Not all deer are large in their stature.  Whereas the red deer is a very large and majestic creature in size and stature, the fallow deer would be a 1/2 it's size.  A fallow doe might reach 40"" at the shoulder, more likely 32-36"". A fawn even smaller. I agree that no creature at 150lb is going to show so little impact damage to the car, but a fawn?"
281450,waterwolf,2008-12-19 04:10:00,556,"this a crock . 150 lb deer don't disappear under the hood of BMW's. i agree with the dog idea .. fox ,, no!! at 140 a deer would destroy a car ."
281473,Rich Clemens,2008-12-19 11:16:00,3131,Packed in there quite nicely.  Fill in all that open space.
281479,outllaw,2008-12-19 11:37:00,1232,definately a hoax. and yes irishfield. those were the days.
281483,OhioFisherman,2008-12-19 11:46:00,6623,Furburgers! Never hit anything at 140mph and wouldn`t want to see the result if I had. The poles do look like a picket fence.
281540,Fishing 24/7,2008-12-19 14:46:00,709,i agree its a 350 lbs moose!  those bmw you never know!
281558,Nemo,2008-12-19 15:20:00,727,"Looks like deer fur to me. I think a fox would have gone under rather than over the bumper. The engine looks like it was pushed back and down (as it was designed to do on impact).  I am not sure a Fox would have had the mass to do this.  A Roe Deer is the right size and color.  The weight of 150 pounds was probably overestimated to conform to North American White Tail conceptions.  European Roe deer are typically smaller.  ""The Roe Deer is a relatively small deer, with a body length of 95-135 cm (3.1 - 4.4 ft), a shoulder height of 65-75 cm (2.1 - 2.5 ft), and a weight of 15-30 kg (33-66 lb). It has rather short, erect antlers and a reddish body with a grey face. Its hide is golden red in summer, darkening to brown or even black in winter""  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_deer  My theory anyways. We need a Snocket Rientist to do some calculations along the lines of F= MXA to determine the forces involved.   Or a DNA  test minimum..  Wow did I just actually waste 15 minutes of my life wondering about this...  Nemo"
281566,1Harringtona,2008-12-19 15:28:00,77,there's supper  Bon appetite
281569,irishfield,2008-12-19 15:34:00,26272," I've still got the original ""weapon"" of choice George... just no where that I can do it in this ""day and age""!  "
281600,Fisherman,2008-12-19 16:46:00,7201,"Like a couple others have said, the deer in Europe are no where near the size of those in North Am. As for those naysayers, maybe FNA can call you out to a few of the more gruesome accident scenes."
281761,outllaw,2008-12-19 23:37:00,1232,"irishfield that is me drooling. i loved them beautys. my buddy had a hemi roadrunner, 68."
281769,irishfield,2008-12-19 23:49:00,26272,"'69 Bee... 383 magnum.. 4 gear.. ramcharger fresh air induction hood... 4th gear swapped out for an ""overdrive"".. 2:73 to 1 rear end. Radar'd at 181 one evening on the highway from North Gower to SFalls at the end of a good 12 mile perfectly straight highway section... and on good ol' CTC tornado tires for god sakes ... but I digress.  I think it's a fox ! lol"
