279372,Tdel,2008-12-14 13:42:00,393,Amen to that.  For some reason each year there always seems to be a nut out there who wants to run Penetang Bay at first ice.  Tom

280061,irishfield,2008-12-16 00:50:00,26272,"I was down at the dock lunch today at 2PM.. there are some open holes in the bay straight out from the docks. If you don't know where the springs/current are in there... stay off it.  Good thing is, is that the rain +9C this morning knocked ALL the snow down... so it's freezin up tight as I type."
