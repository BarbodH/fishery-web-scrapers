I want to get another rod with the extra thick grips you built for me this spring.Do you still have the specks for the little one I forgot what guides and handle we used? If not I can send you a picture.  Thanks  Art

I'd love to have a custom 9' rigger type rod (med action)... long handle ... suitable for a Penn 309 loaded up with 12 lb leadcore and for hanging off  a double salty ... for chasing specks at 9 colours over 120 ft of water in a Laurentian lake .... if you can do custom inscription I'd love it to read ""Kifinti"" in bright red (which means ""how are you"" in Maltese)"
502238,Spiel,2010-09-08 00:14:00,9065, I'm sure I can help you with that and yes I can inscribe it. Shoot me a PM anytime you want to start talking details.   
502261,SlowPoke,2010-09-08 01:27:00,2984,Details? What more info do you need other than whether he likes to fish in the morning or evening? Hehe!  We might need to talk as well. I've longed for a set of mooching rods.
