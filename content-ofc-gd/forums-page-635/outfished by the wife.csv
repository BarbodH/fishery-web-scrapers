Anything from walleye to perch to a nice little smallie. today the winds were lighter so off we went. i know its me holding them,but she's catching them.        These sheepshead really put up a fight, but she got this one all by herself. im gonna get her to hold one next time. just have to convince her that they aren't yucky !!!!!"
