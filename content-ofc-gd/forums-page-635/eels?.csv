We just started, and have only done a few sites in the Ottawa and Rideau rivers so far and no eels yet. They were once abundant in these areas, but sadly are now endangered in Ontario.  So I was wondering if anybody has caught any in these watersheds, or knows of any being caught in the area. I joined this site a couple of months ago and have really enjoyed the articles and opinions posted on here, and thought it wouldn't hurt to ask around and possibly help narrow our search!  Thanks!
