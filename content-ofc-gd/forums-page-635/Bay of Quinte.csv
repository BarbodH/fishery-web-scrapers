Spinner and worm combo was working a week ago, perhaps the terrible weather might have changed them on the weekend, but it has settled down - so maybe they're still on the bite."

502044,Stoty,2010-09-07 12:43:00,2910,"The fishing on the Bay has been great all summer long for us! We have yet to head out and come back disappointed.  We have been fishing out of Picton, using our deepwater weedline techniques. Be sure to utilize your electronics, in order to dial in on deeper weedlines. Throw deep running crankbaits along these weedlines, and you should do well!  For more info on what we've been getting them on..check out our Blog   Good luck dude!  Stoty"
