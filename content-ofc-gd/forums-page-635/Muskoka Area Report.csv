494219,ADB,2010-08-13 21:53:00,444,"This past weekend I fished a cottage in the Muskoka Area.  The bass were on fire to say the least.  In the late morning I hit a fish off of an island with an x-rap.  I then had two more short-strike on my spinnerbait.  Knowing the fish were in the area, I slowed down.  I nailed one a stick worm, and three more slow trolling with the x-rap.  I was fishing alone at this point, so excuse the quality of the pictures.        This one was the fattest of the bunch...maybe in the 3 lb range:    I also tagged a couple of the dock with the x-rap.  One even coffed up a plastic worm:      After some lunch and some rest, I ventured back out around 7:00.  Armed with a skitter-pop, I hit fish everywhere I turned.  Throughout the night I caught around 20 fish, and must have missed or lost at least 10 more.  Of those fish, only one was caught on something besides the popper - a worm - and most of the fish were over 1lb.  The only worm fish:        Great largie:    Nice release shot:      This smallie was pretty dark:      Most of the fish, without exception, would hit the popper after two pops.  I would cast as close to shore as possible, two pops, and a pause.  That would usually enough to do it.     I hope you enjoyed."

494229,ADB,2010-08-13 22:07:00,444, Pink was the colour of the day...but that was also the only colour I threw.
494231,spincast,2010-08-13 22:20:00,3279,"beauty fish, and looks like light tackle. I bet they gave a good run or two before they hit the boat"
494234,ADB,2010-08-13 22:25:00,444," Not too light...spinning rods were medium action, and rigged with 8 lb test.  But yeah, some of the smallies made some incredible jumps."

501788,ADB,2010-09-06 16:32:00,444," Yeah, caught just a few days before the report...for some reason the camera (my mom's) was set to have a date stamp and, obviously, the date was set incorrectly.  No ice* fishing for me lol."
