501980,splashhopper,2010-09-07 02:26:00,2931,enjoy the time you have with her Ryan.. it goes by waaay too fast for me now.
501981,Victor,2010-09-07 02:27:00,1609,"Love the post Ryan. I remember seeing those pictures in every one of your reports since the day she was born!  That last pic is awesome, looks like the WGSF is HUGE!"
501994,ctranter,2010-09-07 03:24:00,543,Averie looks like an awesome fishergirl!  In her short life she has already challenged my 23 years in fishing supremacy.  Thanks for the heartfelt read.
501998,Twocoda,2010-09-07 03:44:00,4130,"Thats it!!!!! that right there is the reason i wanted a ""daddys little girl""....i am soooooo jealous!!!! Man did you just yank my heart strings right out of the cold concrete case i keep it in ...  Many years from now when its her time to marry....her hubby better have some pretty big waders ...to fill her daddys  Cheers Ryan ..your setting the ""bar"" very high"
502004,bigugli,2010-09-07 04:55:00,6138,"Boy does that ever bring back memories. First days of school were scary.  Just remember Dad, you are the parent. If you and the daughter need a little extra together (fishing) time, then so be it. I was notorious for yanking the kids out for some prime father/ child time (So was my one uncle). The kids would be at school next day bragging at show and tell, and I'd be having another talk with the school principal to put him in his place. Besides, you can probably give your child a far better education about nature than some stuffed shirt in a classroom or another NFB reel."
502007,BillsTheBassMan,2010-09-07 05:08:00,932,"That's a beauty post Ryan.  You can rest assured that this bonding time you have spent with Averie will stick with her forever and that the two of you will always be best friends.  She may find herself away from fishing for some time (I fished with my dad growing up, but went away from it for 6-8 years) but she'll always look at it fondly and it will always be something you've shared.  Wish the little gal good luck on her first day from all the OFC'ers.  Cheers, Ryan"
502027,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-07 11:52:00,2050,"Hey Guys and Gals!  Thank you all for the kind words and encouragement.  I thought of this post yesterday, because to day is the first day back for most kids, though for Averie this week she'll just be meeting her teacher and checking out the class room and such... next week is the big week!  Thanks again all - have a good week in the office!  Cheers, Ryan & Averie"
502038,mepps,2010-09-07 12:27:00,1301,"Crazy, I cant believe shes starting school already! One more year for my little boy!"
502043,lookinforwalleye,2010-09-07 12:41:00,4399,"Cool post and some great shots!  I am sure Averie will knock em dead at school,I hope there are no creeks or ponds near school!"
502058,Harrison,2010-09-07 14:00:00,2202," My daughter is 4 and starting school next week.  I hear you loud and clear, just seems like yesterday she was an infant and would pass out in the car seat on the way to Port Hope and I could get a couple hours fishing in(could park right beside me as I fished).  Time sure does fly!"
502069,TJQ,2010-09-07 14:41:00,7806,"Great post Ryan.... Avery just got his drivers licence and its Jadens first day in High School..... OMG.. Thery grow up fast,,, no doubt.        "
502072,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-07 14:47:00,2050,"Awesome pics TJ! Thanks for posting them....  I meant to tell everybody to post their own!  And wow - what a pretty girl... thankfully she didn't take after her old man!  Cheers, Ryan"
502121,Sis,2010-09-07 17:12:00,24,"Wonderful post! And like you said, cherish it.  They do grow up so quickly and before you know it, she'll be asking for the car keys, or boat keys lol. "
502148,rock34,2010-09-07 17:46:00,215,This is an awesome post!!  i have a 7month old daughter right and I hope to have a post like this in a few years with her fishing progession!!  tTanks for sharing.
502202,sneak_e_pete,2010-09-07 21:53:00,540,"Honestly man, that is AWESOME!  I am taking my son ( 3 years old) on our first fishing trip this weekend....after seeing your pics...wished I had started sooner!  Excellent job!"
502213,bigugli,2010-09-07 22:53:00,6138,"I forgot to say... Cherish every moment you have with them. Eventually comes the day when they begin to strike out on their own, the home feels emptier, and you feel older. I'm experiencing that event this year and would give anything to have a few more of those father child moments."
502240,mistyriver1,2010-09-08 00:24:00,600,Awesome post.    Good luck to your daughter in school.
502246,Beans,2010-09-08 00:57:00,3339," I wish I could post some Ryan but unfortunately they are mostly in my memory bank...Nice that we have our digital cameras today...even the cheapies like mine ($93 Polaroid Digital from Home Hardware) take excellent pics...   Way back when, it was expensive for film and developing (if you owned a camera)...  "
502277,Moosebunk,2010-09-08 02:25:00,3970,Exceptional report.  Something really cool to enjoy here.  Thanks for that.
502287,Rattletrap2,2010-09-08 03:13:00,1652,Pretty awesome post Ryan! Something very special between you guys. Cherish it.
502321,Rich,2010-09-08 12:21:00,3927,"Well Ryan, at least at school you don't have to worry about your buddies using her head as a beer holder! LOL  She is a cute, responsible kid and I'm sure she'll #1 love school and #2 do very well at it. She might daydream about big fish once in a while though.. haha  Great post dude."
502342,seaman,2010-09-08 14:11:00,11,"Amazing Report...My Girl is 11, and it seems like we went fishing for the first time yesterday.....I would say ""cherish the moments while you can"" as they grow up soooooo fast, but you already have that covered!! My Uncle used to say ""A family that fishes together, stays together"" Good on you!! Thanks, for a great read!!!"
501855,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-06 20:35:00,2050,"I joined OFC right around the time Averie was born, and made a post proudly presenting my new baby girl!  Here's a picture of her only a few days old, fishing Humber Bay Park for gators! haha     Shortly after that we moved out to where we are now and she's been my best fishing buddy ever since....  First fish hold...   We spent many early mornings beating the banks together...never once did she complain about having to spend time with dad...     Her First brookie.. all be it a stocker...   Then she took well to Ice Fishing...   And the boat opened up a whole new world of opportunities... such as ice out perchin' on the bay...   She out-fished me right from the beginning...   Some days were meant to remember forever like when she caught her first bass!   This past winter we started ice fishing in style!     We've spent many wet nights picking worms...   She's whopped the big boys in local kids derby's...   And this summer she's smashed personal best....   After Personal Best...     After Peronal Best..   When I first wrote reports that included my new and best fishing buddy I was told to cherish the moments while they lasted as they grow up all to fast.  Labor Day weekend is nearly behind us, and before I know it my best bud is going to start her first day of school where she'll make new friends, and open up a whole new chapter in her life.  I don't think I've ever been so excited, and scared as a dad in my entire life. Having a home office, unless I'm on the road, she's only been but a few steps away since the day she was born..... I wish her nothing but the best in school, and the same for all of you parents out there who have kids starting school, or going back again this year.  In the end, as long as she's willing to wet a line with her old man for years to come I guess there's not much more I can ask for!  Enjoy what's left of your weekends and best of luck to all the young ones going back to school next week!  Cheers, Ryan"

501858,Fang,2010-09-06 20:47:00,1330,They do grow up so fast. My oldest is going into grade 12 and my son is grade 7. Sure makes you stop and wonder were the time goes. Could have sworn just last week we were changing diapers.
501859,Spiel,2010-09-06 20:55:00,9065,"I'm with you Ryan, my oldest came in a gave me a big hug and kiss this morning then left for University. I'd give anything to turn the clock back to her first day at kindergarten, man where did the time go.....  You're an exemplary Father Ryan, make the best of every day the rewards of your efforts will come back ten fold.   Thanks for sharing the pictures, oh the memories are flooding back now..... *insert crying emoticon*"

501866,Pigeontroller,2010-09-06 21:16:00,2793,"She's a lucky kid to have such a proud and loving Dad!  My boy's starting grade 4, seems like yesterday I left him at his first day of JK, he was crying abit, so was I...  Great Pics!"
501872,ctdd2006,2010-09-06 21:22:00,531,.....wow!  Do I hear ya!  Gonna be a bitter sweet morning in our house too!
501874,fishnsled,2010-09-06 21:28:00,3520,Excellent post Ryan.  You'll both be fine tomorrow.  I'm sure Avery is VERY PROUD to call you Dad and that you'll be the topic of show and tell one day.

501895,BrownTown,2010-09-06 22:04:00,103,Awesome Post Ryan.. By the looks of all the pictures you are one heck of a happy father! I still remember your videos of fishing the thames...

501925,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-06 23:25:00,2690,"Juli and I just read this one together...all I heard was ahhhhhhhhhhh, oh my God, that is too cute.  Great post Ryan, hopefully you've made a fishing buddy for life out of her. That wouldn't happen to be a Clam 2000 ice hut, would it???  Just got one myself this past March from Steve Rowbotham (of the forum), can't wait to use it....well I can wait a bit, still some good boat fishing to be had!"
501927,Handlebarz,2010-09-06 23:31:00,3790,Great post for sure Ryan and dont forget to save them pics on different formats as we lost the first 2 1/2 years of Jade other then the ones we printed off. This post reminds me of me and my little girl last year she did not get out fishing with me for fall musky she was to busy with her friends even the end of last summer was the same but this year she wants to get out as much as possible I was glad to have my fishing buddy back.  Keep up the great work with the family Ryan they will pay you back time after time.
501938,Rae,2010-09-07 00:07:00,21,"Great Pics, thanks for sharing.  My daughter is 19 months old now and I'm looking forward to doing some ice fishing this winter.  Rae"
501945,Nipfisher,2010-09-07 00:27:00,2449,My oldest starts grade 2 tomorrow. I remember the horror of the first day. We put him on the bus and as my wife was taking a picture of the bus pulling away an older kid on the bus flipped her the middle finger. I swear I had to restrain her from chasing down that bus and pulling Alex off of it.  Good job Ryan. Averie will learn alot of important lessons that can only come through exposure to new people and situations.
501951,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-09-07 00:52:00,1107,Dude that almost brought a tear to my eye LOL she's such a little cutie and prolly the only girl Kaleb has every played with without being mean to LOL good job at starting her at fishing so young Kaleb doesn't have the attention span to fish for more than a half hour or so hope to get him out ice fishing or trout fishing this year

501968,Leecher,2010-09-07 01:50:00,7832,"Awesome post and pics Ryan I remember when Mélissa started kinder garden, we were so nervous leaving her to school that morning all by herself amongst the collective that me and my wife stayed in the school yard until she was inside.... but to make a long story short in the end she made new friends and was a very happy little girl.  I think Avery will do just fine and you don't need to worry.... Kids are resilient and do adapt very fast.  Make sure you take lots of pictures of the event!!! Jacques"
501973,alphaalpha,2010-09-07 02:07:00,475,"Awesome report thanks for posting!  My niece just turned three today and I was hoping to take her out in my canoe this summer but it didn't pan out and she is still a bit uncordinated to be fishing out of it.  Hopefully this winter I can take her out on the hard water in my hut so we can focus solely on fishing and not have to worry about her going in or getting hooked as easily.  I got her a tinkerbell rod at easter and she has loved casting the rubber fish around so i think it should go well.  This gives me inspiration to get her out asap, thanks again!  AA."
