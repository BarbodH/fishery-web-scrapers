501816,scugpg,2010-09-06 18:00:00,1373,We ventured up to the Kawartha's this weekend to a cottage and it was tough fishing out there. Rain and high wind made it tough to control the boat. Spent most of it fishing bass.  Last night it finally calmed down for a bit so I decided to troll some bucktails close to dark. Felt a hard tug and the fight was on! I brought her in pretty quick which was surprising.  We did have a tough time getting her out of the net so didn't get any good hold shots of the fish. It did take a couple minutes to get her swimming well again but she eventually came around. I'll be getting a new net next time out. Its amazing how delicate these creatures can be.  When we did a quick measurement in the water it measured 43 inches. No time to weigh it I wanted to get it back in the water asap. A few pics.      What a rush though I think I'll be muskie fishing again very soon

502008,fisherboy,2010-09-07 05:09:00,48,Nice catch and release. I was on Rice Lake on Sun and weather was nasty as well. Couldn't really fish the main lake so I only fished the river. Tough condition.
502127,diggyj,2010-09-07 17:24:00,548,Nicely done catching your first Musky!
