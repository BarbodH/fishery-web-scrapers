501095,mepps,2010-09-03 13:06:00,1301,silver/black buctail or silver orange bucktail for me - with #7 or 8 French blade!
501118,linweir,2010-09-03 14:25:00,202,"To Lower Buckhorn, I caught Muskie trolling 10"" Strawberry Believer in deep water. Another good lure is TubeJig."
501120,craigdritchie,2010-09-03 14:45:00,1586,"Couldn't agree more on the Muskie Killer. Lots of excellent baits mentioned in this thread, but none are as versatile as the big spinner, and for a lot of reasons:  1. Excellent hooking percentage 2. Comparatively lightweight, so more difficult for fish to throw 3. Casts fairly well even in stiff winds 4. More weedless than jerkbaits or big body baits 5. Can be fished really fast to cover water, or really slow when fish are lethargic, or in-between 6. Can be fished shallow or deep 7. Great stealth bait when muskie are fished hard or otherwise spooky 8. Easier on the arms and back than big jerkbaits 9. Cheap! 10. Also catches the occasional bonus monster bass or walleye  If I could only have one muskie lure, then the Muskie Killer would be it - hands down. But isn't collecting tackle part of the fun?  From An Angler's Dictionary, by Roy Beard and Henry McKie:  Unsporting: Any fishing technique developed around the actual catching of fish, rather than the collection of fishing equipment."
502343,hoops12,2010-09-08 14:11:00,127,"Thanks so much for everyone's advise. I ended up using a black muskey killer inline spinner and man it worked. I landed 6 skies over the weekend, the biggest measuring 45 Inches. Not sure how to post a pic, but will when i find out.  Thanks again"
502353,ehg,2010-09-08 14:55:00,2666,"Congrats on the good weekend! The black bucktail inline spinner has worked for many years.  Try uploading your pics from your computer to photobucket.com, then using 'insert image' button above put image code in. Can preview post to see how it works. Probably better explanation found somewhere on this site."

Thanks again    Hey Guy's  Heading to Lower Buckhorn this weekend and want to try my luck at musky fishing.  The only thing is i don't have a lot of musky related tackle.  So the question is...if you could recommend one, go to Musky bait, what would it be?  Thanks for your help  Hoops12"
500577,lew,2010-09-01 17:32:00,12766,"If I was limited to only one bait for muskies I'd make it a very large black spinnerbait with orange blades.  You can fish it fast or slow, deep or shallow and it works equally well going over rocks, sand or thru thick weeds.  It's also VERY productive being trolled or casted.  "
500578,ehg,2010-09-01 17:33:00,2666,"I am no expert but for the Kawarthas, when casting a silver blade/black bucktail is good and for trolling a perch super shad rap seems to produce. The fish there aren't huge but give a great fight Good Luck"
500583,Roy,2010-09-01 17:46:00,13728,"Yes, you don't need many baits.  Without sounding like a stick in the mud, You should get yourself a proper net and release tools for muskie prior to going out. If you don't have a heavy enough rod, reel, line and leader, there's good chance you'll be killing your first muskie. I know that this sounds really negative to someone who's starting out and I certainly don't want to be discouraging you but it is something to at least consider.  Good luck to you and give us a report of how you make out."
500585,jediangler,2010-09-01 17:51:00,1923,Mepps Musky Killer in Gold blade with Black buck. Every Canadian tire in Ontario carries them. For trolling I'd say an Orange rapala J-13 also at Canadian tire.
500586,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-01 18:00:00,2690," Good point, Roy.  Once he is set-up properly.  In-line bucktail spinner black with either red/orange or chartreuse would be my choice if I could only have one bait.  You can cast it or troll."
500589,hoops12,2010-09-01 18:10:00,127,"Thanks guys for your fast replies.  @Roy...i understand your concern.  I have the proper Rod/reel and craddle as i do a lot of pike fishing, i also make my own flouro leaders. I just haven't tageted musky before.  Thanks"
500590,jbailey,2010-09-01 18:11:00,866,ah the secrets to success lol
500592,solopaddler,2010-09-01 18:15:00,8605,Black and orange inline bucktail.
500594,Joey,2010-09-01 18:17:00,9122,My most productive is the firetiger Super Shad Rap.  Joey
500595,BillsTheBassMan,2010-09-01 18:18:00,932," Jedi, they have those Mepps Musky Killers @ Fishing Fanatics for 9.99 versus the 14.99-17.99 that Canadian Tires have them for.  I bought a pair of them, but don't get up to Musky water very often."
500620,muskeybugged,2010-09-01 19:48:00,282,if you can only use one lure....... I'd be rich!!!  Buck tails and or spinner baits easy to use
500627,Matty,2010-09-01 20:14:00,19,"I have only fished there a few times, but orange blade and black skirt bucktail or spinner bait would be my choice.  I also hear guys do well on walleye colours.  Good Luck!"
500647,esoxansteel,2010-09-01 21:39:00,1307,"Im going against the grain and would use a 10 inch Jake, which will cover more of the water column then some of the other mentioned lures, they are great twitch baits casted and can be trolled at high speeds to at least 7mph or less depth range from surface to 18ft with wire or 10 to 15 with braid and floro or hard mono, cant go wrong with perch or walleye colors."
500667,PAZE,2010-09-01 22:34:00,132,"Well this is easy, you want fish and one lure to run, 10"" jointed believer, without a dout one of the best.  Paul"
500671,Handlebarz,2010-09-01 22:47:00,3790,   Dang Roy how did you beat Dax???
500675,OhioFisherman,2010-09-01 22:59:00,6623,"Any bass tackle, and yes it may have the out come Roy mentioned."
500838,Kawartha Kev,2010-09-02 13:18:00,281,Hoops  My go to musky lure for Lower Buckhorn is definitely the large Super Vibrax #6 black with a bit of red bucktail with the silver blade can't tell you how many musky I have caught on it.  Kawartha Kev
500840,hoops12,2010-09-02 13:25:00,127,"Thanks so much for the info guy's, much appreciated.  Hoops12"
500847,[emailÂ protected],2010-09-02 13:56:00,25,"A big dumb suspending jerkbait...look around there are lots of lures that fit this modus operandi.  You can still cover a lot of water with long casts AND you are targeting active and inactive fish. Deadly!  I can't stress enough though...bolt cutters, bolt cutters, bolt cutters...and lots of spare hooks.  I've seen way too many fish that look like a grenade went off in their mouth.  Good luck"
500885,muskeybugged,2010-09-02 15:32:00,282, You forgot to mention bolt cutters!!!
500902,stubbex1,2010-09-02 16:36:00,164,"i would say either a jake or a believer, either 8 or 10 inch, perch pattern.  Ive caught both of my biggest muskies on these, both while trolling, but they also work great casting as well."
500960,Garry2Rs,2010-09-02 20:45:00,1425,"Spinnerbait in Black.  The blades would be Silver or Gold for the flash, on a sunny day, Orange or Chartreuse, for visibility on a cloudy day. Garry2R's"
501031,Pigeontroller,2010-09-03 01:36:00,2793,"  Mike, my computer was in the shop!  Another vote for a 10"" Jake, Orange Tiger or Walleye colour."
501092,hoops12,2010-09-03 12:44:00,127,Thanks again guys.  I will let you know how I did?
