I even spent some time reading old posts and I believe I've got a handle of how she works here. You know what I found the most entertaining? Reading the locked threads...there are some funny and off the wall comments in those. Very entertaining and humbling.  I'll post up my reports and fishing pics as they come in, for now I'll just post one old pic, no point in recycling all my past photos. Enjoy the pike  Cheers,  Rod Caster"
