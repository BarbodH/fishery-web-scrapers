Considering we dealt with HOT! temps, Sunny skies, Winds and a crazy Algae Bloom we got a few fish and had a great time.  The pics...  Fidel with the largest Walleye of the trip. Must say buddy, your the master of the slash baits.       The Nasty     Off we were to find clean, clear water...     We found some and where there was clear water, there were Smallies!           Feeling great after a much overdue trip up north. Nature really is amazing!  Feel free to add a couple pics Fidel.  Till the next battle which I'm sure will involve some STEEL."
