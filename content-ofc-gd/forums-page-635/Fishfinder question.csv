501573,Fisherpete,2010-09-05 18:00:00,1814,I have a Humminbird portable unit that lost its tranducer (suction cup released + prop = chop). Could I splice this unit into my current Humminbird 525's transducer cable rather than having to buy another transducer? Can two units run off of one transducer? Somehow methinks not...
501574,GBW,2010-09-05 18:07:00,8460,"Pete, I have an old one that may work for you.  what connection to the back of the unit does it look like?  Can you take a pic and post it?"
501575,vinnimon,2010-09-05 18:12:00,2593,"  Not sure about the ducers,but all the plugs should be the same.I use my old hum100 base and power cable for my 535 portable. Call lebarons,they have a decent stock and on the packages its labelled,which ducers are compatible with what units. Since you brought it up,Im going to try my 100 ducer on my 535 unit,and see what happens!If it works,im using it for ice fishing! as a spare!"
501578,Terry,2010-09-05 18:19:00,14456,no they can't....run 2 at the same time but yes you can if you put a switch in line so it only gets a signal from one fishfinder at a time and isolates the other finder
501579,Tybo,2010-09-05 18:24:00,1373,"I believe you can buy a splitter box. With shielded cable is not a good idea,It is hard to get the shield to work properly and you will get frequency interference."
501581,vinnimon,2010-09-05 18:34:00,2593,"Splicing the cable will void waranty if any!Or may short out your unit. Pete! I asked the same question a few yrs back,it wont work!But thats what they say to save their butt!  "
501586,Terry,2010-09-05 19:24:00,14456,for some units you can buy a switch.....they have been making shielded antenna switches for years and years and this is far less power.... for that matter you can put quick switch connectors on the cables and just switch lines quickly  here one but it does one unit but can switch between two transducers no reason why it would not work in reverse  http://radioworld.ca/product_info.php?cPath=4_96&products_id=6278   
501590,vinnimon,2010-09-05 19:36:00,2593,"With all do respect,mes think you missed something here! suction cup let go + prop =gonner! PETE! If my 100  ducer works on my 535!I will post it pics and all!"
501591,Terry,2010-09-05 19:49:00,14456,yeah so he wants to run 2 fishfinders off one transducer and as I have said and I have done yes you can as long as you only run one at a time  what is it you think I am missing here  2 fishfinders  one transducer  one splitter box and run whichever one you want
501594,vinnimon,2010-09-05 20:13:00,2593,"shoot,sorry terry,i figured he was running one finder!My apologies"
501604,aplumma,2010-09-05 21:29:00,6896,Here might be the answer but the price makes it as cheap to put another transducer on the boat.  1transducer to 2 unit switch    Art
501625,Billy Bob,2010-09-05 23:16:00,5865,"Without a splitter switch where you can direct the transducer's signal to only one unit it's not possible.  Now if it was a modern Lowrance unit then YES...but that's because of Lowrance's software and a Ethernet connection between the two units. Then you can even choose of two different transducers either running each unit independently or just one transducer running both units. I have this set up on my boat with two Lowrance LMS 520c units, one at the console and one at the bow with one transducer on the transom and other one on the trolling motor. Both are also networked together using Lowrance's  NMEA2000 network system. This way if you punch in a waypoint let's say at the bow it's also automatically enter into the console unit. Now if they could only get these things make the fish bite..."
501764,Vanselena,2010-09-06 15:07:00,269,Terry is correct.
