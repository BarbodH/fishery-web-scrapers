500869,jayess,2010-09-02 14:47:00,187,Eight of us went into the park over the past weekend. What beautiful weather... 30+C days on a nice spring-fed lake. Fished around for specks on a remote lake for a few hours with nothing to show. At the last minute a friend suggests weighting down our lures. We put on a couple of 2oz and 3oz snapweights and we were instantly rewarded -- action was non-stop on a silver panther martin over 40-60ft of water.

500886,Roy,2010-09-02 15:33:00,13728,"Fantastic, WTG! Great shots too! Thanks."
500944,kickingfrog,2010-09-02 19:28:00,8333,"Nice photo for scale, and two very nice brookies.   However, don't ever let me catch you using one of my paddles as a cutting board."
500950,BillsTheBassMan,2010-09-02 19:47:00,932,Beautiful Specks . . . thanks for sharing (I smell a trip next spring   )
500978,Musky or Specks,2010-09-02 22:16:00,2710,Bill maybe we can arrange something.
500980,Rod Caster,2010-09-02 22:20:00,5784,Beautiful fish. So tasty. Good call on dropping your lures past the thermocline.
501020,camillj,2010-09-03 00:56:00,1988,Awesome Specks ... and great work changing it up to match the conditions ... most of our fish last week were 7 colors or deeper ...
501312,Leecher,2010-09-04 01:24:00,7832,Awesome report jayess and beautiful specks Those specks sure are tough to get sometime.... but you made the right change at the right time.... congrats Thanks for sharing Leechman

501373,fishhunter,2010-09-04 12:27:00,604,"WAY TO GO,GREAT LOOKING FISH"
502131,diggyj,2010-09-07 17:27:00,548,Great markings. Bet they tasted great.
502151,johnnyb,2010-09-07 17:58:00,3413,"You REALLY impressed Solo....he commented TWICE!    Seriously though...when I saw the topic, I thought someone dragged up an old post from the spring...nicely done!"
502155,Spiel,2010-09-07 18:16:00,9065,"Beauty, love Brookies. One of my fave ways of hitting them in summer would be the same tactics that I use in winter. Vertical jigging spoons."
502182,torco,2010-09-07 20:14:00,656,Well done as everyone said its hard to get specks in the heat of summer and to think you could take a swim after catching those beauties. Not usually a possibility when you think speck fishing in Algonquin.
502185,solopaddler,2010-09-07 20:28:00,8605," I thought I had commented then was unable to see my reply so I replied again.  Was pretty sure I was losing my mind, but apparantly not LOL!"
502220,Grimace,2010-09-07 23:10:00,2020,That is fantastic.  Well done.  I like the paddle shots.
