501710,Bly,2010-09-06 12:19:00,1556,"Plans for the day have changed, if anyone feels like braving the elements to fish, shoot me a PM.  I haven't a preference for location or species.    Have a great day everyone!  ps  what happened to the old hook up section?"
501712,Terry,2010-09-06 12:26:00,14456,"when they went to the new board program we lost the hook up section but now more people see it here on the main section , so life is good"
501715,Bly,2010-09-06 12:45:00,1556," Thanks Terry, thought perhaps I was just not seeing it."
501717,Spiel,2010-09-06 12:47:00,9065,Well I hope something works out for you Carole.
501724,Bly,2010-09-06 13:09:00,1556, Thanks Spiel.  Weather any better down your way?
501756,Spiel,2010-09-06 14:38:00,9065, I don't know what the weather's doing out your way but here it's overcast and looking like rain. It's fairly warm with a light SW breeze which is supposed to kick up to 30K later this morning.  Shouldn't affect me too much at my rod building desk......   
501846,BITEME,2010-09-06 19:54:00,1968,YOUR A CLASS ACT DAN(Percher)!!!!!!!!!!!!
501873,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-09-06 21:25:00,1362, Too bad we weren't living closer Bly!!!...The elements don't fizz me unless there's lightning in the skies!!
501877,Bly,2010-09-06 21:36:00,1556,  Ditto Steve but then again I have been known to fish even when there is lightening in the area
501881,fishnsled,2010-09-06 21:43:00,3520,"  Heard that story, one of those I wish I was there but glad I missed it.  lol!!  Had my own close calls with lightening.  Did you make it out today?"
501888,Bly,2010-09-06 21:54:00,1556,"  Wasn't able to co-ordinate so I decided to make use of my kitchen instead....home made vegetable beef, cream of broccoli, and cream of potato soups and a beef and cabbage dish."
501890,fishnsled,2010-09-06 21:56:00,3520, Sounds like any of those will go down nice on a cold muskie fishing day.  I'll drop off my thermos.
501892,Bly,2010-09-06 21:59:00,1556," That was my thinking, what time should I expect you"
