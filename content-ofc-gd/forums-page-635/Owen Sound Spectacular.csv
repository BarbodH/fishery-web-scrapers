501862,Fisherman,2010-09-06 20:58:00,7201,"Well after many hours of trolling in straight lines, loops, S bends, and other maneuvers, I finally hooked up with an 18.43lb salmon.  Landing the fish was another comedy, me out there alone, holding an umbrella, net not yet extended, holding the rod in one hand, knee knocking the tiller to stay away from other boats,  finally close the umbrella, cursed a blue streak trying to open the net, meanwhile she's trying to get away, line peels past the backing knot, hope that holds.  Finally get her close, set the net handle between my legs wit the net overboard, get the fish into the net and sit down on the handle. Get the fish in the boat and she spits out the lure. Lady luck was smiling on me. A couple other boats around me let out a whoop.  Off to the weigh station with another boater, made second place for thursday and 10th place overall.  got a nice prize package.  Barely get back into my truck, the phone rings and 12footspringbok says, what did you get?  There goes the new smoker already, he deserves it, he spent many hours out there at the start of the week with me."

501923,Fisherman,2010-09-06 23:17:00,7201,"I think 19.25 was the winner, it was just mere ounces between the top 10.  Someone got a 16+lb rainbow for the trout category, quite a nice fish."

502019,12footspringbok,2010-09-07 10:37:00,459,Tough fishing up there for sure! I guess it was persistance and putting the hours in that finally paid off! Just a coincidence that i was in the market for a new smoker when you one this one this past week   Decent week off nice scenery will have to try her again next year i think.
502020,Roy,2010-09-07 10:55:00,13728,"Good fish for sure, WTG!"

502026,Fisherman,2010-09-07 11:42:00,7201,"Oh they're in the harbour already, some of the entries were caught from the ""wall"" and trolling inside the harbour."
