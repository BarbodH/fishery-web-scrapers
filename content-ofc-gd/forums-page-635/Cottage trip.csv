500334,jjcanoe,2010-08-31 22:57:00,744,"The family and I made the annual trip to the cottage last week and we managed to get a few...  just missed beating the rain there by about 10 mins it was following us all the way from London didn't even take the boat off the trailer until Sunday afternoon   didn't stop me from taking a few casts at the shore before bed where I nailed my 1st fish of the trip, seems I catch this Pike every year on the first night casting from the shore(first fish the last few years have been a pike from the same spot)   Next morning was a very misty and a few passing showers until around noon, finally put the boat in the water but not before netting this pike by jj jr off the beach   fire up the boat and hit some familiar spots, This dock always has something under it, last year it was a nice pike, this year a big fat smallmouth.   First bucket of the week,   by mid week there didn't seem to be many fish in the slop so we changed up a bit and fished weed edges for a while jj jr.   Doubleheader with the uncle-in-law (Theo) Rock bass on a minnow and sunfish on a 6"" crankbait!   Probably the biggest rock bass I've ever caught! smashed a topwater frog   Tuesday, we cracked open the Dora rod for my daughter, 2 casts, 2 fish. I had a real rod in the pick-up for her but the wife thought she would like the Dora rod better   Took the little girl for a walk to the campground that evening to watch the sunset ""it's too bright!""  ""Good night sun""     took a ride up to Bon Echo P.P.on Thursday   Friday was the best fishing day of the week, we even got up early    after a slow but peaceful morning we decided to head to the ""go to"" spot 1st cast  5th cast  6th cast OH YEAH!   slowed down for a bit afterwards a few more small bass and a little pike, went in for a lunch break and hit the water again    Last fish of the trip was another shore pike which crunched a popper "
