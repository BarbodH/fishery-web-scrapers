501291,nroadrunner,2010-09-04 00:31:00,113,"Well I have had little time ( hour here or there) to fish since mid July.  I have not had the boat in since then just been shore fishing, with not much luck.  Nothing bigger that 8 inches since late July.  Of course every day I have taken off this year it has rained, and today was no exception.  Decided to go fishing for an hour after dinner at the dam, about 2 min walk from my house.  Was going more to practice with my baitcaster, did  not think I would get much.  Rain held off for the hour temp are dropping.  Was 30 ish all week today around 21.  Put on a Bandit 100 series crankbait in perch, 10 or so casts later nice fish on.  I call my wife at home, while fighting fish, to bring camera down to dam.  About 90 seconds after I land it she shows up snap a few pics and back she goes.  Weighed in a 3lb 3 oz on my new digital scale.  Not a monster but after a hard month I was very pleased  This fish was caught in about 1 foot of water right beside the rapids, exact same spot I caught my PB 6lb smallie in early July.  Hopefully the pics work             Ian"
