501732,bassman87,2010-09-06 13:17:00,586,Did you try calling them?
501733,Terry,2010-09-06 13:17:00,14456,I am getting them on expressvu so it's a rogers problem and not from the first transmitting station
501754,Rae,2010-09-06 14:31:00,21,"My Rogers (ch 426) seems to be working fine.  I also just noticed that ch 542 is now WFN in HD, never noticed that before and don't know how long thats been there.  Rae"
501832,adempsey,2010-09-06 19:05:00,1498,"A free preview for WFN was on until August 24th.  If you subscribed, then I have no clue.  Good luck contacting customer service.  Cheers."
501899,fisherman7,2010-09-06 22:15:00,325,Got it working. Had to reset the box. Thanks All!
502009,fisherboy,2010-09-07 05:14:00,48,"since someone mentioned WFN HD, do you find it contains a lot of HD content? or most of the programs are still in SD?"
502087,Rae,2010-09-07 15:40:00,21,"  Well, I just discovered I had WFN in HD on the weekend and from what I saw most shows were ""filling out the screen"", where the old channel would have to be stretched to fill it out. Now, it doesn't seem to be ""Discovery channel"" quality but it looks much better than than SD WFN. Maybe I'm just getting used to HD now and it doesn't stand out anymore when I see it.  Rae"
