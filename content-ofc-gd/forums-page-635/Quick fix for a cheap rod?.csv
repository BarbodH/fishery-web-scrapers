501789,Spiel,2010-09-06 16:40:00,9065,Are these cracks on the male or the female end?
501791,Dave Bailey,2010-09-06 16:43:00,1641,"Oops, female (if fishing rod anatomy is analogous to human   )"
501797,Spiel,2010-09-06 16:54:00,9065,Okay then I would ask are these cracks in the finish over the ferrule winding or in the blank itself?
501802,Dave Bailey,2010-09-06 17:17:00,1641," Um... yeah. Have to admit I have no idea what you mean, although I probably should. Let's just say that they start at the very tip of the ferrule, where the male part begins to slide in. (Damn, now I need another cold shower...  )"

501961,Dave Bailey,2010-09-07 01:25:00,1641, My pants don't go down that far.
501987,HTHM,2010-09-07 02:49:00,4082,The reason they do is; They charge a twonie a minute and it's a coin slot....
