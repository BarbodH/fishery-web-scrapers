501366,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-04 11:48:00,0,Great report. That 3rd one is a solid fish!Did you weigh it?
501405,Shaun Rickard,2010-09-04 16:25:00,144,"Johnny Bass, I didn't weigh it but I'd give it a good 14 to 15lbs, it was a really thick fish. Also, when looking at the pictures, bare in mind that I'm 6ft 6in and weigh 275lbs, I tend to make any fish look small  Cheers, Shaun"
501409,uglyfish,2010-09-04 17:55:00,981,"dude, what happpened to the show?? used to love watching it! was always great to see places so close to home and the way u showed what great angling opportunities were in our back yards!"
501416,Shaun Rickard,2010-09-04 18:55:00,144,"uglyfish, I can't say too much right now but we are working on some ideas to get the show back up and running again. Unfortunately we lost a major sponsor due to a corporate takeover as we began production of season-3 and the funding just wasn't there to get the show to air.  If you're interested you can join our Facebook group for updates etc, I post a lot of reports and videos etc their that you may be interested in.  Here's the link: http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=6426308129&ref=ts  Thanks for your feedback and interest, much appreciated  Cheers, Shaun"
501448,Bly,2010-09-04 23:52:00,1556,some very nice Pike....good luck with whatever is in the works for the show.
501911,mark02,2010-09-06 22:53:00,27,"""... but I'd give it 14 or 15lbs.""  You're delusional!  There's no way it's even 10."
501956,uglyfish,2010-09-07 01:09:00,981,"thanks shaun! i joined up. sucks about the sponsor, but glad to hear ur working through it and pushing forward with season 3! all the best bud!"
