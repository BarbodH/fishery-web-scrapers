500955,cityfisher,2010-09-02 20:22:00,959," Thats a tough question to answer. It all depends on the condition of the bike.  First quad was a 01 formanES... Bought it with 6500km on it. Sold it 10 months later. Only because I hated 4wd all the time, the crappy brakes , no efi, and the Electric shift that would work when it felt like.  Bought an 04Arctic cat 650v2, fast and good get through all sorts of crap, hated the carb, let me down a cuople times in the cold weather, belt blew twice leaving me stranded , overall crap quality. it had 3500 on it.  Bought an 06 Polaris 500x2... 500km on it.. Like new ...mint condition, EFI is amazing, 2up and box come in super handy, never let me down YET. Only bad thing about it is that it wieghts 800lbs ! friggen tank.  In the end its all about the condition.....the price should reflect that"
500989,Big Cliff,2010-09-02 23:07:00,6899,"Sorry my friend, I won't say you are wrong but I'll put my Polaris up against anything else out there. I worked the heck out of my little 350 for nearly 10 years. It never, ever, left me walking and I went places no normal human would walk. The only time it ever quit was when I drove it into a 5' deep mud hole and kept it going."

The guy had 5 models , honda , mitsu , Toyota and 2 subarus but they all are pretty much the same 4x4 ,800cc . This Toyota model was a little different with the wheels of a side by side and a camoflage wrap . He has sold quite a few including a bright lime green model that is driven by an 80 year old man with a grin from ear to ear . The older gentlemen brags that it is the best vehicle he ever had as he also takes it out on the atv trails and says he can go where ever the atvs go . They are about the same width as a side by side and are road legal . You wouldn't use these special wheels on the road obviously but you can change out to the road wheels very quickly .

498323,Abraxus,2010-08-25 18:15:00,104,"This is another thing to consider as well. The solid rear axle is great if you actually intend to use the bike to tow a great deal of stuff!  Ex: Pulling wood out of the bush or towing heavy loads.  Otherwise, its not really good at all for trail riding, road riding or riding in the deep thick rough stuff.  On trails, The solid rear axle offers no articulation of the suspension.  This will often lead to one tire being high sided and not having contact with the ground, resulting in traction loss and a tipping hazard.  Riding on roads with a solid rear axle is okay, but when you go into turns at high speeds, the solid rear axle cannot suck up the turn like independent suspension will.  This leads to wheel hopping and yet again, a tipping hazard.  In the deep thick rough stuff, the solid rear axle almost ALWAYS gets hung up on something! As such, you either must have winch (highly adviseable anyhow) or you have to dismount and start lifting, pulling, pushing and generally humping your backside off in order to get the bike unsnagged.  Not so bad or difficult with a little 350 or 400cc bike, but a major back busting, butt sweating hassle if you are riding a 600lb Big Bore or Twin 650-800cc quad.  The question will be... do you use the bike specifically as work horse, or do you intend to pleasure ride with some occassional use as a work machine.  If the answer is the latter of which, the independant suspension can pull, push and hump just fine, but it will also afford you a great deal of comfort and safety when riding for pleasure as opposed to a solid axle bike.  Ab"

498330,johnyd,2010-08-25 18:37:00,7,I have a 08 sportsman 800 with a lot of mods on it and it have been a good bike for me i beat the crap out of it and it just keeps asking for more.Alot of guys here are correct the Honda's are a great machine but come with the price tag to match. I have 8 freinds with the suzuki's all 700 or 750's they are a great bang for your buck almost all of the problems that i have seen with them have been operator related. The yamaha's are a nice bike but for there dollare they cannot compete with the others. Can am i have a few freinds with those and they are nice but expensive.If i were looking to do what you want i would either look at the Polaris 500 you can get it in either 500EFI or Carbed models with a lower price tag. also the suzuki like i said they are a good bike aswell and come in the 450 and 750.
498416,ch312,2010-08-25 21:46:00,1590," tires have more to do with snow riding than weight of the machine, unless you are riding in deep powder. you need a tire that is designed to push you forwards rather than digging down. the problem is most all terrain and mud tires are designed to dig down to find hard ground and traction. you wouldnt believe the difference tires designed to push you forward will make on any size atv.  highlifter outlaws are probably the best all around tire."
498417,Big Cliff,2010-08-25 21:51:00,6899," Since I hope to be doing a lot more ice fishing this year, what would you suggest are the best tire for the deep snow? I did manage to get stuck once last winter in a huge snow drift. I just plain got hung up but for an old guy even once is too much! I put snow tires on my car, and that sure makes a big difference. Why not my ATV?"
498467,ch312,2010-08-26 00:15:00,1590," i've heard great reviews regarding the ITP tundra cross. they dont have an aggressive tread which helps you ""float"" on the snow rather than digging in. they come studded which definitely makes a big difference on ice. highlifter outlaws are one of the best for pushing through mud and snow as they dont dig either.  itp holeshots and maxxis bighorns are suppose to be very good as well. you also have to consider the traction in reverse. many tires can go forwards very well, but as soon as you try to back up they start spinning immediately. theres a name for what im referring to, but i cant think of it right now.  i have mud lite xtr's and they do quite well in the snow, but im planning on grabbing a set of outlaws very soon..."
498477,Big Cliff,2010-08-26 00:40:00,6899, Thanks! I'll be looking into them for the winter.
498497,Bernie,2010-08-26 01:22:00,3190,I found these tires worked very well. My old BRP traxter isn't a great trail machine but man does it pull. I ended up breaking trail for the group and I was also pulling a trailer. The key for a tire that works in snow is deep and open lugs. Smaller patterns and the snow tends to stick on the tire not allowing the tread to do it's job. Chains do not work as well on this type of tire though as the chain stays below the lugs more. 
498635,wallyboss,2010-08-26 15:01:00,1095,"I have a Kawasaki Power Brute 750 and I had issues with it until I got rid of the original CDI box. Now I have a bit more horsepower but no more of the small ""check Belt"" light coming on and dropping my Power by more than half for no friggin reason.  I have Mudlite XL  1 1/8"" lugs, it'll go pretty well anywhere in snow. Great for ice fishing."

498769,ch312,2010-08-26 20:16:00,1590, u forgot to tell everyone what tires they are   im guessing mudzillas? the less aggressive zillas are an awesome all terrain tire and are one of the lightest out there in its class.  one trick for those who dont want an extra set of tires for the winter is to mount the tires so the traction is reversed. it really helps with keeping the machine going in deep snow.
498782,bbog,2010-08-26 20:44:00,665,"No experience with BRP but a bit with Yamaha, Polaris and Honda. Considering the amount of abuse the owners of these machines (not me) gave them - they all survived. The Polaris in particular had the crap beat out of it on a weekly basis and while it needed gorilla strength to get it to run straight - would not die. The Yamaha owner managed to break both front axles (two different times) by putting too much tension on the front end. There are limits to how much they will climb and at what speed!!  If I had to choose it would be Yamaha followed by Honda. This is largely due to the amount of time I spent on a Grizzly, working it big time and then taking it to the trails and track. Solid machine and no complaints with what you threw at it.  Buddy bought a 2010 Polaris Sportsman 500. Factory tie wrapped (tight) the tank breather tube. This caused small problems due to the use pattern but could have collapsed the tank had it been used for speed runs.  I know you are buying used but one indication of quality is the length of warranty - compare and see for yourself which manufacturers don't have faith in their products.  Just my opinion YMMV."
498794,ch312,2010-08-26 21:02:00,1590," all of the performance and clutch mods people do on newer machines adds a lot more stress on the axles. add in some good mud tires that bite and you have a recipe for disaster. you know the factory ones will break, but who knows when. i'd say they need to beef up the axles straight from the factory for all big bores. spending $1,000-$,2000+ on a set of heavy duty axles isn't my idea of a ""fun"" expense. but, i'm still getting bigger tires, programmer, exhaust, and clutch kit that are sure to snap factory axles like a twig. i guess you gotta pay to play   i bought my 07 grizzly 700 used from a man in london. it was a fair price for what was included and he was only selling to upgrade as he does every 2 years. i was just the next lucky guy in line to get a barely used atv that was treated properly. the same can't be said for the first one i viewed in binbrook. the optional 30"" tires he had were the first hint that it was a mudding machine. loose bearings and cv joints sealed the deal that this machine was beat on. always check them over carefully."

498827,thefireman,2010-08-26 22:53:00,51,"Sell your sled and buy a grizzly 700 with power steering! Go and get a track kit for it and you got the best of both worlds, for what you want to do! The grizzly 700 is one of, if not THE best ATV around.  I know there will always be debate, but I've seen the grizzly do a whole lot more than most bikes ( Polaris, Honda, Arctic Cant and Can-am) All though to be fair Honda is only a 3 wheel drive!"
498869,Bernie,2010-08-27 00:40:00,3190," Oops...Yep they are Mudzillas. I only put them on in the fall for hunting. I have another set of rims and tires for the rest of the year. I had a set of Super Swampers before these Zillas. They were OK but the Zillas are much better. My Traxter gets used daily, pushing cars in the shop, snow plowing, and even occasionally commuting from home to work. I'll throw my opinion in on the best machine. The 800 Outlander. Although the 400 is usually enough for most."
498910,ch312,2010-08-27 01:48:00,1590," FYI...you have mudzillas, not zillas. zillas are a much lighter and less aggressive tire made by the same company, maxxis. just to avoid any confusion in the future"

My dad has a Yamaha Grizzly 600 and he has had no problems with it(2001) and mostly uses it for hauling wood and hunting and other petty things, but again a solid machine.

497802,K_F,2010-08-24 15:28:00,107,you will get years of reliable relitively maintenance free performance from a honda machine.  Preferably with a solid rear axle.  I personally own a 400 suzuki eiger.  However my family own hondas - I could not afford one.  The suzuki i chose was as close to a honda as you could get without the price tag.  The hondas last forever and that to me is worth more than having a 700twin with this and that.  I used a website called powersportsnetwork.com - i think - it has all sorts of reviews of machines and specs and whatnot - I chose a machine based on a reliability rating and the price tag -  my opinion
497810,fishnsled,2010-08-24 16:00:00,3520,"A buddy of mine told me to look at ground clearance and independent suspension.  You may have less maintenance with a solid axle but from my few times riding them, you are pretty beaten up after a long day of trail riding.  Far more comfortable with the independent suspension.  That is just my opinion.   As for a make or model, Arctic Cats use to have the most ground clearance, my buddies machine has served him well for the last 7-8 years.  I believe he has the H2 700.  Nice machine, uses it for plowing snow and trail riding.  I have 2 other buddies with machines,  one Honda and one Bombardier, both have been very happy with them.  Check out the link that K_F posted,  Ask lots of questions, and you'll find something that you will be happy with.  Personally I don't have one but someday...."
497921,Big Cliff,2010-08-24 19:04:00,6899,"Well, I am on my second Polaris. First one lasted me about 10 years and I put that machine through places that a man couldn't walk. I hauled trees out of the bush (and I'm talking 40' poplar with a 12 - 14"" butt and green), drove through mud holes that other machines were stuck in, and even pulled some of them out. It was an Explorer 300 and until the day I drove it into a mud hole that was over the handle bars, it never let me down. Even then, when the water and mud was drained out of the cylinders and crank case the stupid thing started and ran just like it had never been submerged.  I traded it in and bought a new Sportsman 500 in 2006. That machine like the first is beyond belief! 18 of us went on a ride last fall, we went through mud holes and bush that a moose wouldn't go through. I ended up pulling a Yahama for the last 35 or 40 km (I'm not trying to run down Yamaha, his starter quit and his engine kept stalling) but I had no problem driving my Polaris and towing him through some really rough crap. And I am not bragging when I tell you that there were other machines getting stuck in some of the holes I was towing the Yahama through. The facts! Nothing but the facts!  In my opinion the Polaris is the work horse of ATVs, many if not most of the other makes are faster but if you want a machine that will work like a horse for you then my choice would be the Polaris. The big secret to owning one of them is to keep it in Low(automatic) unless you are out and running the road, they like to have their RPMs up there when they are working.  So, for ice fishing, pulling a hut, bringing in firewood or just a good reliable work horse, I don't think you'll go wrong with a Polaris. (although that Artic Cat disel looks good too but I haven't had a chance to do much more than test ride it)( I do have to admit though I did put it through some rough stuff and it did come out shining)If you want a sport bike Yamaha, or Honda, what ever you do, do not buy one of those ""CTC/TSC"" specials they won't stand up the way the brand names will.  disclaimer: The opinions expressed by this writer do not necessarly reflect the opinions of the owners/operators of this board!"

I dont have a need for anything higher than a 500 sportsman. my buddy owns both 400 and 500 HO's at his camp. the trails are ROUGH! rocky as heck, muddy like you wouldnt believe. just hell for those machines and they put up with it time after time.

498079,ch312,2010-08-25 02:15:00,1590,"in the atv world many consider polaris to be an entry level machine. they are well known for having problems and they simply cant stand up to the abuse of serious riders. i ride nearly every weekend with 4-25 guys at a time and polaris machines always have problems. on our last ride a newer polaris 700 broke 2 axles while an older 700 smoked off a belt that only had 800kms. plus they also weigh a fricken ton  can am have horrible frames that get bent up quite easily and replacement parts are expensive. they do seem to be reliable and they are the fastest stock machines, but a bent frame = $$$  most consider yamaha to be the best for quality with kawasaki and suzuki not far behind. i have 3300 kms of hard riding on my 07 grizzly 700 with power steering and there have been zero problems. i literally treat it like i only paid $5 for it and really beat the crap out of it mudding. its been rolled 6 or 7 times now and the plastics are in rough shape, but she keeps on trucking without missing a beat.  the thing with buying a small bore atv is you wont have the size and power there when you need it. you may not use the power all the time, but its much better using a big bore for work and plowing.   really bad pic, but its all i have. im in the process of modding it to make a mudding machine. i highly recommend full skid plates to avoid costly repairs...

498084,ch312,2010-08-25 02:24:00,1590," considering my belt driven grizzly can do wheelies no problem with me sitting down, id have to say no to that one  belts can slip when riding in deep water where the shaft will keep going. shafts are strong and require less maintenance, but when something breaks its probably going to be expensive. a belt is $100 and easy to change."

498104,DRIFTER_016,2010-08-25 03:25:00,10439,We have two vintage Hondas up at the lodge and they just won't die. I'm not sure what size they are but one is kid sized and the other is probably a 250 I think. They have been used on a daily basis for at leat 20 summers and are still running like new.  Here's a couple of pics of my buddy on the baby bike. We loaded into the boat and took it over to our air strip to run his gear up the hill.

498186,doubleheader,2010-08-25 13:22:00,497,If you're talking reliability ask just about any atv mechanic and Honda is at the top of the list followed closely by Yamaha and the Suzuki.
498188,ckrb2007,2010-08-25 13:26:00,449,Is any one machine better than others in the snow? I do a ton of ice fishing on Lake Simcoe in the winters.
498203,K_F,2010-08-25 13:58:00,107,"a good set of tires will get you through the snow - and if thats youre only concern - buy a bike woth lots of ground clearance  that powersports website i posted will show you the ground clearance specs for all the different machines  like i said before i have a  ""little 400"" with less than 10"" clearance - a set of mud tires and it always get me to the deer stand in the snow"
498234,Abraxus,2010-08-25 15:38:00,104,"' Well Colin, you will get many varying oppinons on this topic.  That being said, I do have some thoughts of my own to offer.  I for one own a Suzuki King Quad 700.  The Suzuki King Quad is ranked as one of the best over all, go anywhere ATV's on the market.  Down sides, it is heavy!  The Suzuki's are very reliable and my beast has never left me stranded anywhere and has cost me very little money in maintenance in the time I have had it.  Now, as for the other brands, each have their pros and cons.  I personally would stay well clear of the Polaris and Artic Cat brands.  They have the reputaion of being great when they are new, but they have a heavy burden on maintenance and lack relaiability down the stretch. Their resale is really not that great either.   Honda has the reputation of having the best reliability of any bike on the market!  They are simply bullet proof! However, their technology is really behind the times when it comes to ATV's.  They do not have authentic, true 4X4 capability.  Their 4X4 system is a limited slip set up.  Meaning, when you really get into the deep nasty stuff (that you WILL encounter on occassion, even if you have no intention of looking for it) the Honda lacks the ability to select the 4X4 Differential Lock.  The Diff Lock will get you out of stuff that the a limited slip just cannot. Anyone who tells you otherwise, has not really buried their bike bad, whether accidentally or intentionally.  Kawasaki Big Bores are monsters!  Total hair raising beasts. Though I have heard they have some issues with reliability as well.  CAN AM's are way over priced for what you get.  This all having been said, I will tell you the same thing I told my brother when he was looking to buy an ATV.  I have a Suzuki King Quad and I love it, but bang for buck...you just cannot go wrong with the Yamaha.  They offer everything!  Reliabilty, easy maintenance, an abundant availability of parts when things do go wrong and they are one tough peice of kit!  The Yamaha name is one of most recognized and distinguised brands when it comes to ATV's.  They can do it all.  Push a plow, pull a cord of wood, dig down deep in the mud, raise hell with big bore power on the straight stretches.  They also have EXCELLENT resale value.  My brother bought his Grizzly and thanks me often for guiding him in this direction to this very day.  Anyways, thats my oppinion on the subject.  I would also advise you go check out this website. www.nyrocatv.com. It will virtually be one of the best resources that an ATV rider could ever have!  The members on here are super helpful and will assist you with any questions, problem or concerns you would have as an ATV owner, Rider, or potential buyer!  Save it in your favorites, because it will come in handy! TRUST me on that!  Ab"
498254,pike n' whities,2010-08-25 16:14:00,131,"  Yes, they do. Although they're pretty solid machines, not really all THAT bad. but my buddy is having some issues with his clutch even at low idle. his winch works when it wants. constantly blowing fuses. best part is that it keeps running  .... that's the brute force 650. I think it's a 2006 or 2005. his other deal, brute froce 750. 2008 I think, hasn't had any problems yet to my knowledge. i'm sure they'll be commin' around the corner though. one of the best quads i've ever ridden for comfort IMO. Independant suspension on the 750, but straight axel on the 650. Again, both pretty good quads, but not something I would personally buy.  As you can tell, I like this thread. lol  JP"
