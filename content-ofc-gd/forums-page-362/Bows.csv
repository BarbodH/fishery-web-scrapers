734680,lew,2012-10-05 15:56:00,12766,"From what I read Bill, the fella was just asking a simple question as to whether folks were catching anything in a river and he didn't appear to be asking for specifics.  Just my opinion, but lately I think far too many guys are too quick to hammer a new guy for no real reason.  As ehg mentioned, things used to be alot more civil around here."
734683,Christopheraaron,2012-10-05 16:11:00,3525," Never saw that civil time that you mention, but I definitely agree a lot of people just overreact now..."
734684,Spiel,2012-10-05 16:15:00,9065,If all members new and old were completely familiar with the forums rules we wouldn't be discussing this now.
734383,[email protected],2012-10-04 13:21:00,2,Anyone catching Bows below Paris yet?
734385,BillM,2012-10-04 13:24:00,17367,Go and find out then let all of us know.
734386,sauce,2012-10-04 13:31:00,219,Trout are closed upstream from brantford as of Oct 1st. There are probably some around anywhere down from brantford. Check the regs to find out about what's open in your area.
734388,fatherof3,2012-10-04 13:47:00,1769,"actually from 100m downstream of the highway 2 bridge( the high level)in paris is an extended season till Dec 31 for trout as per the regs. Having fished that area for years yes you should be able to get trout at this time,hope that helps"
734392,ttahhan,2012-10-04 14:28:00,191," Hello , Nice to meet you, and welcome ..... thank you for the introduction and little about yourself.....what is a paris ???"
734393,mirogak,2012-10-04 14:49:00,387, Lol - LMAO - nice reply Top Water!
734394,Pikeslayer,2012-10-04 14:54:00,1443," Yes. According to friends down that way, they have started to turn on.  good luck."

734398,lew,2012-10-04 15:33:00,12766,"I spose there's folks that think about joining this board, then read replies like those posted above, and move on to other boards."
734399,kemper,2012-10-04 15:43:00,2232, Go and find out then DON'T let all of us know....
734401,BillM,2012-10-04 15:48:00,17367," I hope he got my sarcasm , lol."
734406,12footspringbok,2012-10-04 16:07:00,459,"My experience says when people start asking about fish running in a spot, they've probably been there for at least 2-3 weeks..."
734407,Harrison,2012-10-04 16:12:00,2202,Caught outside Marselle.  
734409,Christopheraaron,2012-10-04 16:30:00,3525,Check your pms.  And LOL Harrison!
734417,[email protected],2012-10-04 17:03:00,2,"I apologize for not introducing myself, certainly like most on this board I'm a fishing fanatic and outdoorsman. Thanks to those who provided positive feedback ... much appreciated.  Tight lines ..."
734420,northernpike56,2012-10-04 17:26:00,717, lmao
734434,adolson,2012-10-04 18:17:00,783, TL;DR
734435,ttahhan,2012-10-04 18:17:00,191, Is that a Rainbow ?
734436,ttahhan,2012-10-04 18:21:00,191," Hey there again, sorry for that reply, its just being new its always a good practice to introduce yourself...no harm no foul.....Welcome"
734447,Live2fish85,2012-10-04 19:11:00,1633, Funny I don't recall you making a introduction in your first few post. It wasn't't until someone made a post about it. I do recall you making a lot of useless poll threads though.  Keep up the good work there.
734454,Spiel,2012-10-04 19:48:00,9065,"Alright, enough of the snottiness, everyone here was new at one time. Not everyone introduced themselves before jumping in, myself included (way back when).  It's not a prerequisite but it does help, as for the negative comments I've read on various posts today, I'd expect or at least hope for better from the members here."
734495,ttahhan,2012-10-04 21:49:00,191, OK
734662,ehg,2012-10-05 15:01:00,2666,"You are right Lew. Back many years ago there was a different helpful spirit here, Now...  Useless, cool hero comment."
734666,cuzza,2012-10-05 15:10:00,467,"FWIW, I wouldn't think there'll be many fish that high up yet, it's early and we haven't had much rain. I fished that area this same weekend last year (when conditions were more favourable) and didn't see any signs of fish let alone catch any.  That said, it's probably worth a go - check the regs before you do though, Paris to upstream of Brantford Conservation Area is artificials only."
734676,BillM,2012-10-05 15:47:00,17367, Kemper is right though... There's no need to go bang a few fish then come here and spill the beans about it because you want a little internet stardom.  Keep it under your hat and enjoy your little secret for as long as it lasts...
