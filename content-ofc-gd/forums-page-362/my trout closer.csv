At one point I had a very large brown trout, probably around 16 inches, which would have been the biggest fish I caught from this particular stream on, but I got him beside me and attempted to lift him out of the water by the line, and he shook and got off. As you can imagine, some choice words were muttered after that.. lol.  Matt."

734178,Joeytier,2012-10-03 15:17:00,3990,the panther strikes again!  good stuff dood
734209,ehg,2012-10-03 16:53:00,2666,Nice resident browns. Those Panther Martins are best on headwater trout even chubs like them
734339,northernpike56,2012-10-04 01:37:00,717,I have caught a lot of trout with panther martins. It's worth the cost of buying a few each year when you get them stuck in trees
734346,GreenCanada,2012-10-04 02:49:00,375,"Nice Brown Trout! I wouldn't suggest lifting a 16"" Brown out of the water by the line. It puts unnecessary stress on the fish and even worse, they can shake off!"
734348,BillM,2012-10-04 02:59:00,17367,Pinch those barbs while you're at it boys!   Great fish.
