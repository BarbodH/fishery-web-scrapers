From what I can find out, they are best fished under a float/indicator a few feet off bottom. Can anyone give any more tips for rigging them up? Are there conditions when they'll outfish other baits or is it just a case of changing things up til something works?  Thanks!"
734681,Christopheraaron,2012-10-05 16:07:00,3525,Just finished tying a few flashy steelhead flies myself! never fished jigs for them before but steelhead love anything that flashes so I would imagine there is no wrong way to fish them. They look great by the way.
734686,highdrifter,2012-10-05 16:24:00,2534,Nice!  But I think TJ owns the rights to that word...
734707,krixxer,2012-10-05 18:39:00,274,you don't have white?   Not conventional but last year I used a (heavy)fly just like that under a slip bobber. I had great success in the lower with that set up.
734710,Christopheraaron,2012-10-05 18:43:00,3525, I found a streamer made of only blue crystal flash works alright too.
734715,cuzza,2012-10-05 19:13:00,467, I did think of TJ when I was typing the title  The one second left is white with a splash of pink (looks more pink in the pic TBH) - was planning on doing some more so flashy blue and pure white seem to be the order of the day. Thanks for the feedback guys
734724,Handlebarz,2012-10-05 20:07:00,3790,Sorry any thread with that title must have a pic of Monique holding more fish then TJ.  Btw nice jigs
