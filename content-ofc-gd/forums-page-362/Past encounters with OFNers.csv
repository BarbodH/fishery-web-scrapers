733345,fishdawg,2012-09-28 22:57:00,912, Colin & Skeiner are 2 different folks   but both excellent fellas to hang on the water with
733378,Leecher,2012-09-29 02:06:00,7832,"For me, had the pleasure to meet 3 OFC members and share quality time with    Mike the Pike, vinnimon and carll2.  I truly enjoyed meeting them face to face and shaking hands... was like I've known them for the longest time   The best part for me was being able to speak to each other in real time and share stories  Mike, Vince and Carl, thanks ever so much for the time we spent together   it was a real honor to meet you"
733383,Bernie,2012-09-29 02:45:00,3190,"Had a lot of fun with several OFC  folks. Can't say I caught any wood however.  This was several years ago. Haven't heard from this fellow for a while, but whatever he's doing, he's having fun.   Look here, Joe with a fish!   And CCMT got one in the winter!   Gerritt up after a nap.   Fishnsled....   Spiel & Joe couple weeks ago.   There have been a couple others as well, but can't find the pics."
733418,Moosebunk,2012-09-29 14:03:00,3970,"Historically haven't had the easiest opportunity to meet up with people from the boards being that I was rather far away... but that said, over the years the number of folks from here and elsewhere I have met and fished with is really quite remarkable.  OFC'ers I have had the pleasure to fish with have been a rock solid 100% awesome bunch."
734043,highdrifter,2012-10-02 19:45:00,2534,That day we had last fall was pretty amazing..  Glad you posted this.  Let's get out soon budday!
734051,mepps,2012-10-02 20:33:00,1301,Good stuff man! I was just fishing with HD yesterday!
734297,misfish,2012-10-03 22:51:00,29133,"Well I can check off this fella on my list.  Nipfisher (Blair) and I spend sometime on the riv today. Introduced him to the pin. Took a bit,but he was getting the hang of it.       Also met Lazlo,out at the parking lot when we came out. He has a good story to tell Highdrifter.  Nice to meet you Lazlo."
734298,Terry,2012-10-03 22:53:00,14456,looks like he did better then me
734299,misfish,2012-10-03 22:55:00,29133,Ah NO. He cursed just as much as you. HAHAHAHAHAHA    
734300,Fisherman,2012-10-03 22:59:00,7201," Hey, hey, hey, what's with the drinking pinky sticking out.."
734310,manitoubass2,2012-10-03 23:49:00,11391,"The only board member I've had the privilege of fishing with was Limeyangler (Simon).  We had a great time and alot of laughs, sometime we'll get out again. 6 billion amazing lakes between him and I in a 3 hour stretch. The tough part is gonna be picking where to fish, lol.  We didnt get on the walleye quite like we wished, but we caught some good numbers. Also had some great scenery.  I had a good laugh when Simon took it upon himself to harass some of my neighbors, bwahahahahaha          He also caught an old lost rod of mine,    Dood is a class act"
734314,Nipfisher,2012-10-04 00:05:00,2449," New RESPECT for you ""pinners"". My shoulder is sore and my hand is still cramped. Thanks Brian and nice to meet you Lazlo."
734804,LeXXington,2012-10-06 03:43:00,1928,Great post  I have met many OFC'er over the years either out fishing or at G2G all are great people. It was good seeing the pics of old friends.  Almost feels like the next BOQ GTG is right around the corner  See you on the water
734811,Handlebarz,2012-10-06 10:05:00,3790,I must say I have met so many great people from the OFC board that I will not list them its to long. All I can say is that people from the fishing community are awesome.  I almost only share my time with people I met through fishing I guess its because they have the same passion for the sport of fishing or the sport of getting away from the rest of the world and enjoying being on the water.  If it were not for fishing in my life I can just imagine where I would be that is one of the main reasons I have tried to instill the outdoors passion into my kids. I love this dysfunctional OFC family we have here and look forward to meeting more great people from here.
732949,Jigger,2012-09-27 00:40:00,1237,"After you've been around awhile, you get to chatting with enough folks and one thing usually leads to another. Aside from Pike opener and Bass opener, I find that I tend to g2g with more OFNers in the fall. More often than not Bass is the main quarry. But you never know when something out of the blue might surprise you. I've fished with a pretty good number of past and present board members Bucktail, Sinker, Crazyhook, Cudz, Lucid, Highdrifter, GBW, and a few others may have passed this way or that. Thanks to all that have shared a boat, a pier, lakeside, shoreline or a riverbank. I've taken away something from each of you and, hopefully, left something in return. Just thought I'd start this thread in honour of OFNers that maybe YOUve spent some time with and maybe drop a story, or simply a pic of others that have passed your way... Thanks OFC for being the resource that brings us together!  Sinker and I got out a few times in search of skis in the Kawarthas. But there was a cursed net involved that didn't help matters. Don't let him fool you, he loves catching these. Who doesn't?    Lucid enjoys slowing down the pace and really picking spots apart. Was out with him this past bass opener and he put on an absolute clinic! Sure hes known as a T.O. pike guy, but hes a self-admitted bass addict.    Highdrifter joined me last Thanksgiving for a day up in Haliburton. I owed him one after getting skunked the last time he was in my boat. He brought a friggin banana on board. Guess what? As soon as I made him throw it overboard we erased the skunk that had been dogging us that day too! He did ok for himself that day...    theres a vid of this one, but I can't figure out how to embed it. So...    I've been blessed to fish with Cudz a few times the last couple of years and can't thank him enough for the lessons learned. Hes the first guy to show me the dropshot technique. Even offered me a rod pre-rigged. I turned it down thinking my tube would be adequate. I got schooled. He can grow a heck of a 'stache and catches ridiculous fish...    GBW and I come from a relative past. We knew each other back in highschool but never enough to go fishing. Been out a couple of times now thanks to OFC. Unfortunately for us, aside from a nice fish early on my side, fish were scarce this day until we were just about ready to go he says ""I don't care if its even a perch, just let me catch one!"" As if on queue...    Thanks again OFNers, you're alright by me."
732993,Sinker,2012-09-27 02:46:00,8692,"Its been a while man, we should hook up!!  S."
732995,SLA,2012-09-27 03:03:00,23,.
732996,GBW,2012-09-27 03:05:00,8460,"You forgot to mention it was damn cold that day... Again, let's get out and get out SOON!  TKSGIV weekend is out but others have a small chance due to kids hockey.  As to the intent of the post, I have pic's of headhunter, ccmt, young_one, fishensled and a bunch of others here that I have met through this great site that I will look for a post later.  THANKS TJ AND CREW for OFC/OFC!!!!"
732999,fishdawg,2012-09-27 03:15:00,912,"""Colin"" was my first OFC'r & internet fishing pal I met back in 2004. Ive met and fished with many since and to this day some of my closest fishing pals are/were at one time or another active OFC'rs.  Thanks again TJQ  heres a few quick ol photos i found bonus points for the 'oltimers who can name 'em        "
733000,e-z-out,2012-09-27 03:17:00,1052,Was nice to fish with you on the ice a few years back. Still looking for that jig that lights up lol
733073,ccmtcanada,2012-09-27 17:15:00,7971,"I have fished with quite a few OFC'ers since I joined back in 2006.  A few of them I consider very good friends today...ones I would have never met if it wasn't for this site.  I did a little thank you song for the site a few years back...anyone remember how it goes?  That being said Jigger...we live what...10 minutes apart??  We have to stop saying ""we should get out soon"" via PM and just do it! LOL"
733093,misfish,2012-09-27 19:29:00,29133,"Have had the pleasure to fish with many here,and many I have not yet. Lots to do with time frame. CCMT (Cliff) will be the next one soon. Looking forward to that one."
733094,NAW,2012-09-27 19:49:00,4022,"I've fished with a pile of guys/gals from this wonderfull site.  Posts like this come every now and then.  I have an expanding OFC Bucket List of folks I would like to fish with.  Not to point anyone out....  But:  Fish up north with Moosebunk Go an a Mike Borger Adventure Hit the rivers around the Sault with Tdun Go bass fishing on Simcoe with Cudz (preferabliy while he is supporting the ""monkey tail beard"".) Fly into the temagami with Irishfield Beat the rivers with BillM and Brian for a day Hammar some geese with Sinker Hit 6-mile for a day with Bugugli Musky hunting on LSC with some of the musky guys!  The list is much longer then this..  But I don't have time right now to type it out.  It's funny, becayse everytime I think of who I want to fish with from this forum, my list keep growing longer and longer."
733096,lew,2012-09-27 19:52:00,12766,"I've been a very lucky guy and in the 10 1/2 years I've been hanging around this board I've had the pleasure of fishing with almost 70 different members.  We've boated 100's of nice fish together and even been skunked a bunch, but we ALWAYS had a great time  And I've never met an OFNer (OFCer)I didn't like"
733097,misfish,2012-09-27 19:58:00,29133," Anytime bud.    That ones very close to the top of my list. Ok number 3 closer to 2.LOL  Maybe we can hook up and get him to get us out.   The very first OFC member I hooked up was Wolfville (Randy)  When I fish with Lew,we have a good understanding. I fish for bass,and leave his muskie alone."
733098,lew,2012-09-27 20:11:00,12766, And we always have a blast !!
733099,misfish,2012-09-27 20:17:00,29133, 
733103,glen,2012-09-27 20:39:00,2641,I caught wood with Terry and Wanye.
733127,ccmtcanada,2012-09-27 23:01:00,7971, Looking forward to it too Brian!!!
733141,GBW,2012-09-28 00:59:00,8460,"15 min as he's 4 from me, LOL!  that's just wrong knowing Wayne (face to face) and Terry from here (but hope face to face perch'n this winter)...  Been fishing with a bunch of folks here over the years and forgive me if I miss anyone.  Jigger (he started this whole post, so LOL), CCMT, Sinclair, young_one, HH aka headhunter, fishnsled, bitsmith2, gerrit (sp), lincon and a bunch of others that I know right now but all I can think of is real names and not OFC/OFC names.  Love it here..."
733142,GBW,2012-09-28 01:02:00,8460,OH!  and the ever so missing SNAG's!  MISS YA MAN!
733143,Jigger,2012-09-28 01:04:00,1237," One day the stars will align. Im sure of that!   Lots of time left for it to get cold again! Lol    Pretty cool seeing that ski swim by the hole! You can have that jig. It needs a new home...   I remember that little ditty! Pretty much like NAW said. Every once in awhile a thread like this pops up, this little oasis being what it is.  Im hoping weve already got the ball rolling for the fall     Not really what i had in mind with this thread. Not that theres anything wrong with that"
733160,EE_,2012-09-28 01:54:00,36,"Fishdawg If Im not wrong Colin is aka Skeinmachine, Skiener Always enjoy reading his posts in those days Do not see him post any more in Spoonpullers since the new management though"
733207,Headhunter,2012-09-28 12:49:00,5703,I'm sure Terry and Wayne enjoyed that! HH
733224,wormdunker,2012-09-28 14:07:00,1711,"I enjoyed the M&G on Callandar Bay last January.  Met many wonderful OFNers that day.  Hey Nipfisher any plans for a M & G this coming hardwater season.  I left Sudbury in July, now working in Fort McMurray so my time is limited to keep up to date on the board."
733281,ehg,2012-09-28 18:39:00,2666,"Fished with Sinker at Pigeon as well.  Have fished with many from this forum just by running into them at Toronto Islands. Mostly about 7-8 yrs. ago. Fished some with SNAG, FHR, Highdrifter, Patrick GG, Dude,Lucid, etc...  A picture of Lucid about 7 years ago this was mid-March.   Dude with nice pike late March about 9 yrs ago.   Ran into Mikeh at Pickering outflow 6 yrs.ago in winter.   He helped me with this musky from Pigeon. Not biggest but healthy looking musky.   Even got out with BillM for Rocky Saugeen specks about 5 yrs.ago   Never attended G2G or anything but still met plenty of OFNers. Every person i have met from forum were exceptional, friendly folk."
733284,Christopheraaron,2012-09-28 18:51:00,3525,"I'm still a newb on this board but have met with Garry (2rs), Bahrum (redpearl), Matt (northernpike56), and I stood at Lew's house LOL!"
733306,Spiel,2012-09-28 21:04:00,9065,"Wow, if I had to throw a number out there for the number of guys I've fished with and socialized with through this forum it would be well over a hundred. I won't even try to list them all as my memory is not what it once was and I'd be upset if I forgot to mention even one.  I will state however that everyone of them I'd be happy to spend time with again."
733308,Terry,2012-09-28 21:20:00,14456, that is wrong  so very wrong in oh so many ways   lol
