732254,Toddyc20,2012-09-24 22:50:00,141,After a tough year on simcoe i'm just wondering if the smallies are back to being somewhat predictable yet? All year I was having a difficult time locating them due to the extreme temperatures. I'd love to hear from all of you simcoe experts.
732256,davey buoy,2012-09-24 22:53:00,5505, I'm definitely no expert but we found good sized ones this year in 10-30' of water. They were a little deeper than normally but real nice size.!
732289,d_paluch,2012-09-24 23:40:00,343,"I've yet to find them, but always love reading about people who have. Was out today...a little too choppy that's for sure and managed 1 Goby.     "
732294,solopaddler,2012-09-24 23:49:00,8605,Exhaustive radio telemetry studies have shown a mass migration of large smallmouth bass into Lake Couchiching.  That's where everyone should concentrate their efforts.                   
732464,Toddyc20,2012-09-25 13:46:00,141,Hahaha good attempt to mislead us. This is my first year putting in a solid effort on simcoe and so far it has not been worth it. I really hope that this fall turns things around for me.
732477,ra95,2012-09-25 15:08:00,49,Even pike refused to show up this year. Maybe we should have stocked the boat at August when bass stopped biting.
732485,misfish,2012-09-25 15:40:00,29133,Time will tell. Lets see what the BPS OPEN guys bring in.
733001,Toddyc20,2012-09-27 03:47:00,141,When is that tournament?
733016,misfish,2012-09-27 10:48:00,29133,
733029,Toddyc20,2012-09-27 12:42:00,141,Thank you for the link. I don't think I can wait till the end of October to find out how the fishing is so I think I'll head out this weekend to try and find some.
733129,davey buoy,2012-09-27 23:22:00,5505,"Will be out Sat for large and small mouth, will be plenty of both I'm sure. Hoping to get into some big gators!"
733132,Dan668,2012-09-27 23:47:00,1120,I'll be out saturday Also. Have done well on couchiching. Great numbers but nothing of great size
733181,Toddyc20,2012-09-28 03:35:00,141,I wish you both luck. I hope you have good reports to get my hopes up for Sunday.
734824,Sour_Squirrel,2012-10-06 12:52:00,196,Caught  a few in the 2-3 lb. range during the week at the north end of Snake Island in about 8-12 feet of water. I was fishing the drop-offs into deep water using pumpkinseed coloured tube jigs with 1/8 oz jigs on 4 lb test line.
734841,BillM,2012-10-06 14:31:00,17367, You'll wanna beef up that rig if you plan on fishing the deep stuff for the monsters.
734850,Toddyc20,2012-10-06 15:32:00,141,Thanks for the info. I tried to get out to the deep water last Sunday morning but the wind was fairly heavy so I stuck to cooks bay.
734905,krixxer,2012-10-06 21:32:00,274,"I was around fox last Sunday, didnâ€™t find any bass but the perch were hot  Tomorrow looks like a good day. I'll be dragging tubes on the north end of cooks.   "
734927,Dan668,2012-10-06 23:08:00,1120,"I managed a fair amount of bass, nothing over 2lbs. Lots of keeper perch and Two small pike last sat. Was thinking Simcoe again tomorrow but I think I'm going to hit up honey harbour"
734934,Sour_Squirrel,2012-10-06 23:53:00,196,"   No need. I set the reel's drag with the right tension and I'm good to go. The rod I normally use is a 6'6"" ultralight Shimano Compre.   I hook the fish and take my time playing it out. Besides it's a lot more fun catching Smallmouth using light tackle."
734936,Grimace,2012-10-07 00:07:00,2020," You can't feel the fish's full strength on really light line like that.  When you have to set the drag that light, the fish just takes drag uncontested and you really do not get the sensation of their strength. I like 6 pound.  I know 6 is the next step up from 4 but the difference is significant.  The line isn't so strong that you can muscle them in and there is enough tension that the fish has to work for it and show you his strength."
735007,Ron,2012-10-07 09:18:00,1683,I go with 5 lbs. It's the best of both worlds. You can take your sweat time fighting the fish and there is just enough resistance to think you will appreciate the strength of the fish. Then again I am using felt covered hooks so as to not harm the fish.
735027,Cudz,2012-10-07 13:58:00,2652,"I typically use 15 pound braid with a 6ft 8 pound fluoro leader.  I have used 6 pound in the past but find it breaks easily, not from fish but from being compromised by rocks and muscles on bottom.  Too many reties. When fishing 30 ft in the fall I don't believe that 8 pound will make too much difference compare to 6 pound."
