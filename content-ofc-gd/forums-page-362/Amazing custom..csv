734537,Live2fish85,2012-10-05 00:14:00,1633," Yea my daughter eats on the floor now haha, just kidding. I keep it in the closet in the 2"" rigid pvc case I made. No chance its getting broke."
734685,highdrifter,2012-10-05 16:23:00,2534,AAOOHHH!!  much better...  Can't wait to see the fish porn.  cheers HD
734692,bare foot wader,2012-10-05 17:07:00,1354,I definitely think that hardy looks way sharper than a guru would....sweet looking combo
734704,Live2fish85,2012-10-05 18:21:00,1633,"Thanks guys. Hopefully I will land something worth posting haha.  bfw, I agree. After talking with the guy at the store I went with that. He said if I plan on doing salt water fishing then the guru would be better. In fresh water they will both hold up great."
734201,Live2fish85,2012-10-03 16:21:00,1633,Well I finally got my first custom done. I had Spiel build me a 8wt 9' on a Rainshadow RX7.  I have to say that this thing makes my other fly rod really feel and look cheap. Which it was cheap in the fly world but Spiel is amazing.  I have been out with it a few times now and wow is all I can say. I haven't landed any good fish yet on it just a few annoying bass. I was out this morning with it and had a salmon go for the fly but I pulled it away before he could get. Chris recommended that I don't go for the boots with it which is fine.  Well I continued fishing and a few cast later bam fish on. A nice brown. I am not fishing a river or creek just so you know. Any ways I continue fighting the thing get him to shore go to net it and oops I hit the line with the net and snapped my line. Talk about a piss off.  Regardless of that I have to say that the rod is amazing in action as well. I have never used such a amazing rod. This thing is amazing.  Any one looking for a new rod no matter what you are fishing for talk to Spiel. He truly does amazing work.  Thanks a ton  Chris.  I can't figure out the copy and paste thing on this new phone yet so when I can I will post pics.
734202,Twocoda,2012-10-03 16:35:00,4130,Congrates!!! to both of you...happiness is almost always fishing related...now put that thing away and get some upgrades Cappy
734233,capt bruce,2012-10-03 18:32:00,820,"You have just joined the club of well satisfied people that have the pleasure of owning a very special piece of fishing gear , enjoy it."
734241,Stoty,2012-10-03 18:52:00,2910,Looking forward to seeing some pics!
734274,Christopheraaron,2012-10-03 21:31:00,3525, x2!
734303,misfish,2012-10-03 23:05:00,29133,"I dont need to see pics,I totally understand your respect for the new build."
734338,Live2fish85,2012-10-04 01:35:00,1633,I need to figure this new phone out haha. I will read the instructions later. Then I should be able to post the pictures.  Maybe Spiel can post a couple I know he has and then I will figure out how to post the others of the rest.  Brian it is so true. I can't imagine any one could have a rod by Spiel and be unhappy with it.
734421,highdrifter,2012-10-04 17:26:00,2534,Sooo uummmm..  Can we see it now?  Pretty please?!
734424,Spiel,2012-10-04 17:30:00,9065,Glad you're enjoying your new rod Chris.  The only picture I have is of the handle and I posted somewhere previously but here it is again.     
734430,Live2fish85,2012-10-04 17:51:00,1633,Thanks Chris.  I am still trying to figure out why I can't copy my link from photobucket.
734432,bare foot wader,2012-10-04 18:01:00,1354,"what reel did you end up putting on there?  the rio versatip lines are pretty slick too, well worth the money IMO"
734437,Live2fish85,2012-10-04 18:24:00,1633,I went with the Hardy DD 7000.  I also put on Rio Steelhead and Atlantic line. I am going to get another spool and put Rio gold on it I am thinking.
734439,Twocoda,2012-10-04 18:31:00,4130,Chris if you can figure out how to email them to me on your phone.. ill post them for [emailÂ protected]
734440,cuzza,2012-10-04 18:43:00,467,"I seem to remember you like pike fishing? If you want to cast half a chicken, try a Rio Pike (same as the old Clouser taper), Mainstream Bass or even the Outbound Short which would probably cast a whole chicken  My 8wt does double duty for steelhead in winter/fall and bass, pike and carp in summer and I use two lines as well, a Steelhead taper for nymphing and a Mainstream Bass for everything else, as the two seasons don't overlap I swap them - my job for tonight as it happens!  Nice rod BTW"
734441,Live2fish85,2012-10-04 18:49:00,1633,Thanks Dave. I can send emails no problem from my phone just a pain with the copy and pasting. I will email you them in a few minutes thanks.  Cuzza your are right. I will be doing a lot of pike fishing with it as well as bass and carp in the summer. What line would you recommend I gets for targeting all them.  Also I never really though of just taking it off and putting the other line on. I think I will save the mine and do that.  Thank's all.
734465,cuzza,2012-10-04 20:23:00,467,"I use these http://www.rioproducts.com/fly-lines/freshwater/specialty/mainstream-bass-pike-panfish/ at $40ish it doesn't matter if I stand on it or get it caught round a tree limb. I also overline by one weight so use a 9wt on my 8wt - makes casting a bit easier.  These look good too http://www.rioproducts.com/fly-lines/freshwater/specialty/power-fly/ but to be honest any bass/pike line will do as they're meant for casting big flies, carp flies don't tend to be big like a massive pike fly or a popper so whatever will work for those two will cover carping as well."
734469,Live2fish85,2012-10-04 20:45:00,1633,Awesome thanks cuzza. If the weather this winter is like last winter. I will probably be doing a lot of fly fishing for pike. As well as steelhead.
734471,bare foot wader,2012-10-04 20:54:00,1354,"if you're new to fly casting overlining by 1 weight or the rio outbound line will help you feel the rod load  the gold is a good line but don't think it'll serve you well if that's our intended line for throwing pike flies...plus it's expensive  can't remember what blank spiel said you built on, but action/tapers for dedicated pike and steelhead rods are pretty different...you can definitely fish multi species but if you want a dedicated rod for throwing half chicken pike flies then a 9'6"" moderate action steelhead rod isn't gonna shine in that department...and vise versa, a 9' xfast pike rod isn't gonna roll cast that well or be too pleasant to fish on the river for steelies  definitley need to see pics of another spiel masterpiece with the reel mounted...what thread colours did you go with?"
734473,Spiel,2012-10-04 21:02:00,9065," Blank info BFW.......  Rainshadow RX7 - F908 - 9'0"" - 2 piece - 8 weight - butt .415 - tip size 6 -Med-Fast - blank weight 2.17oz - Large & Smallmouth Bass /bonefish/light Salt Water"
734475,Bill Shearer,2012-10-04 21:04:00,456,"Chris has so much talent and expertise when it comes to building a rod, that even though I still might be able to build one, I would never be able to do it as well. That's why he is my ""go to rod builder"" Perfection is what he attains every time."
734488,cuzza,2012-10-04 21:25:00,467," Go with the Rio Pike or a Coldwater Clouser (eBay is your friend here) - some of the bass lines have a warmwater coating that will stiffen up a bit in very cold conditions - it never gets tropical warm up here anyway so the coldwater stiff will be fine.  BFW has a good point on the action (hence I have 2 8wts  one very fast and one softer) but i recon that blank will be fine, easier to roll cast with something a little too stiff than cast chickens with a noodle."
734508,spincast,2012-10-04 22:44:00,3279,"sweet rod Chris  congrats - are we gonna loose a troller to a tier, or are ya still gonna be looking for those summer bows sammies and reef bending bass?"
734516,Live2fish85,2012-10-04 23:09:00,1633,"Thanks Rick.  No I will still be chasing the bows and salmon through the summer. As for bass, I don't think I will be targeting them to much anymore. I will still get out for bass at the reef as its right there. I will be doing a lot more musky fishing though."
734524,Twocoda,2012-10-04 23:48:00,4130,sorry Chris ...just got home from fishing heres the photos   Very nice!!!!
734528,Live2fish85,2012-10-05 00:06:00,1633,Thanks a lot Dave. I really appreciate it.
