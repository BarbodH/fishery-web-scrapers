A compilation of the film footage from the few days I managed to get out fishing in September. Lots of Walleye plus a Muskie, some Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Rock Bass, and Perch caught in the Winnipeg River and Minaki area in Northwestern Ontario.<br style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18.200000762939453px; background-color: rgb(236, 236, 236); ""> <center><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/iiDgrEkvO5Q"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>"
