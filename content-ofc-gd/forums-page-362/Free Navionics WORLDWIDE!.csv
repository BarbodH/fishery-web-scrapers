734350,young_one,2012-10-04 03:55:00,620,"Is it only me or is the Navionics main site giving free access to worldwide major marine charts? http://www.navionics.com/  Excellent detail for most of the lakes around me. (All Kawartha's, Great Lakes, Muskoka, Quinte and etc)  I think this is a limited access/bug, or else how can I justify my PC App purchase?  Take advantage of this while it lasts!   "
734354,fishnsled,2012-10-04 04:29:00,3520,"Seems worldwide, depths seem to be in fathoms on all the charts."
734356,young_one,2012-10-04 04:33:00,620,"you are right Will! Tittle changed. This is too good to be true.  It is really interesting, I'm exploring ocean depth around Japan, harbor areas around Hong Kong, Honolulu in Hawaii, Red Sea, Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Caribbean Sea, and etc.  Navionics really have a huge data base!"
734369,Harrison,2012-10-04 12:18:00,2202," Perfect!!! Thanks.  I use them for the different shades and contour lines, not depth anywhow."
734373,azebra,2012-10-04 12:39:00,168,"I think I know what I'm doing all day. A chart of the depth of the estuary section of rivers would be awesome,, so if I'm reading this correctly, the mouth of the Humber river says 0.5. So is that 1 yard 3 feet deep? I always thought it was like 15 20 feet deep, maybe that's just cuz of the dirty chocolate color?"
734374,lew,2012-10-04 12:40:00,12766, Multiply fathoms X 6 and that'll give you depth in feet.
734375,BillM,2012-10-04 12:41:00,17367, Mouth of the Humber is shallow.   Within casting distance it's 4-6ft.
734376,azebra,2012-10-04 12:42:00,168,If it is in fathoms.... What does the M mean a little further out from the mouth of the Humber. My guess meter depth but so and so^^  got me calculating fathoms
734379,darsky,2012-10-04 13:01:00,586,can these be downloaded to mmc card or just available for print screen?
734380,BillM,2012-10-04 13:01:00,17367,Those depths are correct and are in fanthoms..   Navionics isn't going to give anyone free charts    They want you to oohhh and awwww about them so you purchase their map cards.
734438,hotsky,2012-10-04 18:30:00,400,Stupid question but how do you read the depth? They're in feet im guessing? what does it mean when there are 2 numbers with one just below the other?  Just looked up fathom.. 1 unit is 6 ft on those maps? Makes more sense i guess.
734462,MuskieWannabe,2012-10-04 20:13:00,79,"I've been playing aruond trying to find the 40 acre shoal, but where I thought it was it is still close to 100' deep...Any helpers want to provide a picture of where they think it is?"
734463,Terry,2012-10-04 20:22:00,14456,it's in a lake    and without a name for the lake it would be hard to give help
734546,hotsky,2012-10-05 00:41:00,400,"Just looked at lake Ontario max depth which is 244 on the map, which has to be in meters sense lake O. is 244m deep."
734559,MuskieWannabe,2012-10-05 01:28:00,79,Never heard of the 40 acre shoal???  Musky haven on the Larry....hoping to make it out there in the month or so.
734561,Terry,2012-10-05 01:33:00,14456,"The 40 Acres"" as an area that spreads itself north four miles from the head of Grindstone Island to the Canadian Admiralty islands, near Gananoque and then west five miles to the area stretching south from Howe Island to Wolfe Island"
