I am looking for eyes, bass,muskie, and specks if there around. Just moved form the soo and don't know any one to fish with so any help would be appreciated.  Thanks"

734606,bare foot wader,2012-10-05 03:37:00,1354,"a pair of waders/wet wading during summer and the otonabee will be your friend....below london st dam/hunter st bridge is a good area all the way out to the gazebo  look for a cheap used canoe(always on kijiji/craigslist) and you'll open up a lot more great areas, on the river and within a 2 hr drive"
734631,Live2fish85,2012-10-05 12:49:00,1633,There are a lot of good places. As bfw mentioned the London st dam is a good area. As well as near lock 19. Just make sure you know your regs as it is closed longer then usual at lock 19 in spring.  Also theres a few spots just past Bensfort rd. (May have spelt that wrong).
734641,Sour_Squirrel,2012-10-05 13:27:00,196,Try the causeway at Bridgenorth on Chemong Lake. You can catch nice Bass and Walleye right from the shores there.
734733,esoxansteel,2012-10-05 20:54:00,1307,"You are a half hour from Port Hope, and some of the tribs flowing into Lake Ontario, which will provide you with the same species as in the Soo. There is also 6 dams on the river road, from Trent University to Lakefield on the Otonabee River that hold the usual warm water species ie walleye, bass, musky, and panfish carp etc. plus there is a dam at the Zoo, as well which all dams hold oxygenated water, and usually deeper holes below them, check them out access can sometimes be difficult as fences have been put up on some to prevent drownings on Hydro properties, there is lots of cold water streams for resident trout, but you will have to search them out on your own, which is half the fun anyways. There is no shortage of fishing spots from shore in this area."
