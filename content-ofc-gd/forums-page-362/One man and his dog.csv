734590,ProFishermanJones,2012-10-05 02:58:00,77,cool video and awesome dog!!
734592,backbay,2012-10-05 03:05:00,773,awesome dog is right. He's a handsome pup for sure!
734597,gino,2012-10-05 03:14:00,400,"Simon, your dog is getting bigger and he seems to love fishing...he is my favourite color for labs. Nice amount of walleye from just shore fishing...even with the bad weather it was not a bad day overall."
734599,The Urban Fisherman,2012-10-05 03:15:00,2050,Good stuff Simon - what an awesome looking pup to!  Thanks for the post!
734604,manitoubass2,2012-10-05 03:26:00,11391,Awesome as always Simon!!!!  Snow should be at your doorstep any time now
734614,spincast,2012-10-05 09:26:00,3279,"also knows as Simon goes to the seafood section... so was this off the the end of your yard or did you actually have to drive more thn five minutes to get this feast?  Nice stringer.  Rolof wont be a pup much longer., but he sure is  growing into a good looking dog.  I suspect he and Jack are pretty tight too?"
734649,fishnsled,2012-10-05 13:56:00,3520,Roloff sure makes for a great fishing partner! Great report and I'm sure that many of us are jealous of that sweet shore spot. Thanks for the report.

734700,limeyangler,2012-10-05 18:10:00,5204," Thanks man  We definitely got one of the better ones of the litter. His brother lives just up the road and is all shaggy and half Roloff's size.      Thanks, he just needs to calm down a bit.....lol.      Yhanks Ryan, this time last year i would not have believed i would enjoy having a dog.....i still cant believe it....lol.       It hit overnight Rick....Jack literally squeeled with delight when he saw it this morning...we were out in it by 7:30am                  I actually had to drive for 15 minutes....friggin hardship! Jack and Rollff have a LOVE/HATE thing goin' on.....lol.       Thanks dood.       AWESOME looking pup! She looks real smart and well trained too.
