734825,wall i,2012-10-06 13:02:00,48,"Been on a bit of a ""reel"" binge over the last month. Back in the mid 70's I acquired three reels that I've fished exlusively with for the past 35 years+_. Two ABU ambassadeurs and an original series Zebco Cardinal. Theyve been rebuilt over the years and I guess I was a little reluctant to retire them as they held so many good memories but more so I guess because they performed flawlessly. I like buying quality and get a bit of satisfaction from a piece of equipment that can last years with just a bit of maintenance. Anyways, went out this month and bought three new reels....two ABU Record series..a 40 & a 50 and a Quantum KVD Tour low profile. I expect these reels will outlive me (Im in my mid 50's). Kinda nice that given our manufacturers overall penance for cheap quality short lifespan goods...as a fisherperson, one can still acquire well built gear to build memories with."
