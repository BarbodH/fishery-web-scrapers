734633,SirCranksalot,2012-10-05 13:01:00,3291,"I use reading glasses already. It's not just a vision problem. I use pliers because, when I grip them between  my big thumb and forefinger, the lead is in such an awkward position that I can't get the line in the tiny slot."
734635,BillM,2012-10-05 13:02:00,17367,"I use my teeth..  I'm sure I'll keel over one day in the river due to lead poisoning, but it works great"
734651,Crazy Ivan,2012-10-05 14:04:00,184,I got one of these -  Warning - happy music during the video.
734656,cuzza,2012-10-05 14:47:00,467,"I've made the move to non-toxic this year which seems to be designed to be moved, just push a thumb nail into the slot and they open as long as you don't clamp them on with pliers.  I get mine on trips to the UK where the only shot you can buy is non-toxic apart from size 10 and down - not as cheap as lead but being easier to re-use makes up most of the difference."
734669,strakey,2012-10-05 15:15:00,78,Hi there u can go online to centerpinangling.com and order them along with specialized pliers for removal of said shot. Toronto based company but shipping is 8 bucks minimun so make it an order
734672,blaque,2012-10-05 15:37:00,2419," Ugh, same here......and its really been on my mind the last couple years. Im going to try and make a concerted effort this year to try and stop. Its certainly the most productive way to get it done......its not going to be easy trying to mess around with hemo's and tinh shot with numb fingers all winter that for sure  Ive got some inventions kicking around in my head for a fix but havent gotten around to prototyping any of them just yet lol"
734673,BillM,2012-10-05 15:43:00,17367,"  There is a lot of residue in the Blackbird shot, rinsing them off then putting them back into the containers would most likely help quite a bit."
734674,ch312,2012-10-05 15:45:00,1590,time for some questions from a noob...  is there really a significant difference in numbers of fish caught on winged vs non winged shot? are steelhead really that fussy? how much does winged shot effect the way your bait drifts? same size weights from top to bottom?   i need to get dialed in. 4 outings with zero fish sucks
734675,davey buoy,2012-10-05 15:46:00,5505," Are they lead or non lead?,what would you recommend if they have both?."
734677,davey buoy,2012-10-05 15:50:00,5505,"i need to get dialed in. 4 outings with zero fish sucks  Me too, great question but have to increase my odds by listening to proven veterans. ."
734679,BillM,2012-10-05 15:54:00,17367,"Your shot pattern all depends on the river you are fishing.  For the most part it's bigger to smaller (Unless you're fishing fast flows and you want to bulk shot right about your leader)...  Steelhead aren't fussy, biggest mistake I see new guys make (And I did when I started) was running their rigs way too shallow and using far to big a float and too much weight..  All you're doing with a rig like that is smashing your roebag/bead whatever into the bottom and dragging it around..  That's not a very natural presentation..  I like to run a longer leader then most 36in+ with a 4-5gr float in slower flows... and if I need a few dust shot on it, then so be it..  If you aren't getting bit on your first 6 drifts, change something..   Making the same drift over and over again without changing up if you aren't getting bit is silly."
734690,ch312,2012-10-05 16:52:00,1590," thanks for the tips. it's hard learning the game when i don't have anyone to physically show me prime water and proper technique to fish it. therefore, i could be making critical errors without even knowing. on the other hand i could be using the right techniques, but applying them to the wrong water or i could just be fishing at bad times.  as with any other fishing, i know that changing thing's up to find what's working is important. the problem here is nothing has been working for me so far and the only success i've had is honing my casting skills around the lumber."
734691,BillM,2012-10-05 16:57:00,17367,You definitely wanna drift in tight to the wood   Sometimes 6-7inches will make all the difference between getting bit or going home with a skunk.
734870,misfish,2012-10-06 17:59:00,29133,"  Yep. I love the wood now,even if it means retieing at times."
735012,super dave,2012-10-07 11:47:00,323," I do the same except go one step further.  When I get home,  I'll take a pocket knife and pry open the shot for reuse."
735013,davey buoy,2012-10-07 12:05:00,5505," That's the way to do it,no waste!"
735079,SirCranksalot,2012-10-07 21:19:00,3291,  I do the same for medium size shots but I find that my big fingers won't let me do that to the smaller ones. 
734448,davey buoy,2012-10-04 19:33:00,5505,"Other than a couple line tangles,I guess that is why some of you guys use wingless bb weights for float fishing. Went to a ct store and two small tackle stores and they all have the same. Will have to hit a bigger store for them but do you think it is really necessary? I have loads of winged ones. Just trying to put the odds in my favor a bit, if it's a better option.  Thanks Dave."
734450,BillM,2012-10-04 19:39:00,17367,"Winged shot act like fins in the water, you aren't getting a very natural drift with them pulling your bait all over the place."
734452,Spiel,2012-10-04 19:45:00,9065,"Definitely, absolutely, always go wingless shot Dave or float fishing."
734455,davey buoy,2012-10-04 19:50:00,5505,"Thanks guys, I'll try and get some,but they can be a bugger to get off. Sometimes the easiest things aren't the best."
734456,Spiel,2012-10-04 19:53:00,9065," They're not meant to come off Dave, once expired slide them together and tuck them in a pocket for proper disposal."
734457,misfish,2012-10-04 19:54:00,29133,"Didnt believe me?  Oh,and I have gone to bulk shoting. World of difference.   See,I listened .LOL"
734458,davey buoy,2012-10-04 19:57:00,5505," It's not I didn't believe, it's what I had,and now I have to find them locally. This learning curve is very long. lol."
734460,ratherboutdoors,2012-10-04 20:06:00,132,Rack and reel used to have them.  She closes most days around 2 and she may be on vacation this week?
734467,Roy,2012-10-04 20:28:00,13728,Wingless BB size are $3.49 for 150 at BPS if you're the area.
734468,misfish,2012-10-04 20:31:00,29133, Grab me 4 bags Davey.
734470,davey buoy,2012-10-04 20:51:00,5505,Won't be till next week as of now. I will grab you 4 bags Brian than. Thanks Guys.
734476,davey buoy,2012-10-04 21:05:00,5505," Thanks for the tip Roy!,I take it that's a decent price."
734491,bare foot wader,2012-10-04 21:28:00,1354,"decent price if they're soft shot  I like using sure short, blackbird makes good shot too...pinch them on lightly too, will adjust easier without damaging your leader"
734492,davey buoy,2012-10-04 21:34:00,5505," What would be the difference other than the obvious?, ""better"" or just a personal preference as you say. Thanks."
734493,misfish,2012-10-04 21:37:00,29133,"BLING BLING.  Like in a post way back,soak the shot in Javix. Makes it go black. No more bling."
734496,davey buoy,2012-10-04 21:50:00,5505, Well I'll be damned!! Thanks.
734497,bare foot wader,2012-10-04 22:10:00,1354, what he said...don't want the shiny stuff...soft lead is the best shot but getting harder to find
734498,esoxansteel,2012-10-04 22:16:00,1307,"  I did buy some their and they were not very consistent in the cut, not in the centre, making most of them close to the edge more, and therefore falling off easily, bout 3 packs and they were all the same, might have been a QA problem, or a bad lot, but im sticking to Water Gremlins, and allowing them to tarnish as always to remove the shininess from them."
734503,davey buoy,2012-10-04 22:24:00,5505," I'm using water gremlins also,but their winged. Very soft and easy to squeeze. Now you have me thinking,maybe try JB's or Le Barons for the wingless ones."
734504,Christopheraaron,2012-10-04 22:28:00,3525,I got one of the raven multi sized tins from bronte outdoors.
734506,davey buoy,2012-10-04 22:32:00,5505," I have more than enough multi sized weights,it's the bb size,in the right style I'm needing now."
734554,Twocoda,2012-10-05 01:12:00,4130,no complaints with Sure Shot...  heres a link to etackle ...Phil has everything you didnt know you needed  http://www.etackle.ca/float-fishing/
734557,Jet,2012-10-05 01:26:00,364," If you have nails on your fingers (which is why I keep some growth during float fishing season) and use water gremlins, you can squeeze the nail of your thumb and index finger into the gap on each side and open them back up again. I do it all the time and save a lot of shots.  If you don't have nails, then you're likely out of luck."
734568,SirCranksalot,2012-10-05 01:50:00,3291,Does anybody else have trouble putting those small shots on the line? I have trouble seeing the slit and I usually have to hold them with needle-nose pliers. It's bit bit awkward and I still spoil a lot. Anyone have a slick method of putting the shots on the line?
734572,Twocoda,2012-10-05 01:54:00,4130, Yep....reading glasses...
