734028,kickingfrog,2012-10-02 17:52:00,8333,"That's an easy way to get seriously hurt. If you think a 300lb linemen can make a QB look like a rag doll, just imagine what a wild animal more then twice as big would do to that CO."
734030,mercman,2012-10-02 18:40:00,7054,Dont matter KF..Thats the most amazing thing i have seen in a while. I believe the moose knew the CO wouldnt harm him.
734032,bare foot wader,2012-10-02 18:50:00,1354,"very cool video...siras moose though, don't think anybody would be trying that with an alaskan bull...but an alaskan probably would've dragged the swingset away with it anyways lol"
734038,Jigger,2012-10-02 19:12:00,1237,Shouldve used knipex
734039,NAW,2012-10-02 19:14:00,4022,That sure is one tough swing set!  I would have thought that moose would have ripped it out of the ground.
734048,Christopheraaron,2012-10-02 20:13:00,3525,"Very brave trooper! (if you look he's a trooper, not a ranger). But I agree with KF, even though this moose was not violent it could have been, they should have taken extra precautions (sedating, emergency crew, tranquilizing)."
734050,woodenboater,2012-10-02 20:22:00,2277,"Indeed, this could have gone wrong is so many ways and I'm amazed it didn't. Makes you wonder if animals have some kind of sixth sense as this moose didn't look *that* nervous around the guy and it almost seemed like it knew what he was trying to do. or it was just so wary and held back.  A part of me hopes it wasn't on the wrong end of a later hunt either."
734054,manitoubass2,2012-10-02 20:42:00,11391,"Incredible video!!! That dood was very brave!  To me, the moose sounded pretty exhausted and or very stressed out. Who knows how long it was fighting the swingset???  Anyhow, this is one of those videos where if it goes right your a hero, or it goes wrong and your dead and/or the laughing stock of the internet"
734055,F7Firecat,2012-10-02 20:51:00,347,"beautiful animal, great deed"
734057,misfish,2012-10-02 21:04:00,29133,"I,m a firm believer,that when an animal is in distress,and a human is trying to help it,theY sense it. That moose was stressed (like said,you could tell by the breathing). It never made one aggrasive move towards the guy trying to help, cut it loose. He moved slow,and at one point,even petted the moose.  Well done IMO."
734058,NAW,2012-10-02 21:05:00,4022," Ya, the moose is spent.  By the time a full blown resuce team would have came, that moose might have been close to dead.  It sure was breathing heavy, and his tung was hanging out of it's face.  Just look at how many times the chains where wrapped around.  The moose might have been there for hours.  Who knows."
734060,esoxansteel,2012-10-02 21:23:00,1307,  X2 on that one MF
734061,lew,2012-10-02 21:27:00,12766,Always enjoy seeing folks helping critters in distress.  That guy did an exceptional  job there.
734063,kickingfrog,2012-10-02 21:49:00,8333,"It's not about the animal making an aggressive move, it's about a stressed animal panicking. A person, capable of logic, panicking in the water will pull under rescuers because their brain really isn't in control anymore.  I'm glad it worked out, but it would take so little for it to have gone very bad. People see something thing like this and think: ""That worked out for that guy. I'll help bambi out of this clotheslineâ€¦."""
734068,chris.brock,2012-10-02 22:28:00,4053,"cool video, it did look pretty dangerous for the officer, it also looked as if the moose understood what was happening too"
734081,BillM,2012-10-02 23:22:00,17367,That moose was pretty beat trying to get out of the swingset (You could hear him breathing extremely heavy)..  CO did the right thing..
734092,GBW,2012-10-02 23:43:00,8460,"Same here  I was going to say that, LOL!  mind you they were red...  Either way, I got the feeling the moos understood what was going on and thought with every 'snap' of the clippers it thought it was free and tried to move on.  Brave yes, ended up worse than how it did, for sure it could have.  at the end of the day, has winternet set in already to nitpick over this?  Not that I know of, it was a cool video that the OP found to share."
734114,Stoty,2012-10-03 01:53:00,2910,"Very cool!  And totally off topic... but I just noticed a post on FB from a guy (onto the Gander Mountain page), that he saw a young deer get chased into a creek by a large dog, and it got caught up in the lily pads and went under. He was in his bass boat, and went over, pulled the deer out, and literally gave it CPR! he posted a picture and everything!  Very cool stories!"
734157,iFish4real,2012-10-03 12:56:00,386,I would have kept it there until the moose season opening ....kidding
734164,fishinmortician,2012-10-03 13:24:00,100,That made me sweat watching that!  Good thing that moose was wiped
734451,castgame,2012-10-04 19:44:00,161,"ha 'the moose whisperer'. what a calm and collected guy! i'd like to say i'd have done the same but no way am i getting that close to 400kg of panicked antler and muscle. very cool to see, thanks for sharing!"
734472,Live2fish85,2012-10-04 20:55:00,1633,Awesome video.
