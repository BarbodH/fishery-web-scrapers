734532,hotsky,2012-10-05 00:08:00,400,I wouldn't be surprised if you could count all the walleye in there on your fingers.
734607,northernpike56,2012-10-05 03:42:00,717," binbrook. I thought I heard that some of the left over walleye that get put in hamilton harbor go into binbrook once, but I kind of doubt that's true."
734637,Christopheraaron,2012-10-05 13:13:00,3525,"They're in there, but count yourself lucky if you catch one!"
734079,hotsky,2012-10-02 23:15:00,400,"Was just looking at Google maps to see if I missed anything close to home that can be fished. I've been to obvious and popular places like the Harbour, Coots, Binbrook, Grand river, Mountsberg, even 50 point conservation pond. As well as some others a little father away (Guelph and Fanashawe lake, Thames river, Dunnville, Long point, Big creek). That's since picking up the hobby in May.  I love trying new places and wondering if I'm missing anything else close close by (about half an hour away from Hamilton, that I zip down to for a few hours after work or on a weekend). Any good smaller creeks or lakes/ponds that I overlooked? As to what I'd like to fish for, bass, pike, carp, catfish, haven't fished for trout yet but basically if they're biting I'm interested  Thanks"
734080,bassman87,2012-10-02 23:20:00,586,join the zoo at petro canada park
734084,Christopheraaron,2012-10-02 23:29:00,3525,You are missing sooo much
734086,hotsky,2012-10-02 23:31:00,400,"I thought about Bronte, 16 mile and Credit river. Haven't tried any of them yet. Heard they get busy, and I'm a fan of solitude when I'm fishing unless im with a buddy of course. Out of the 3 which one is the least busiest? best fishing? Any of them have pike?"
734090,Christopheraaron,2012-10-02 23:40:00,3525,"you might find a pike or two in the marinas but not many, 16 is probably least busy but you have to really look for places where your allowed to fish."
734096,ketchenany,2012-10-02 23:48:00,3229,People here mention the Toronto Island for Pike. May have to drive a bit faster to make it in 1/2 hour!
734105,Christopheraaron,2012-10-03 00:40:00,3525," For sure, and any of the shoreline around the harbour front."
734109,hotsky,2012-10-03 01:19:00,400,"I'll try Hamilton Harbour again first, I heard there supposed to be pike there as well. Toronto Islands sounds tempting but I just got a speeding ticket recently...  I'm just not a big fan of driving there... one time I'll try it."
734111,Christopheraaron,2012-10-03 01:30:00,3525,"If you do look for the clearer water, thats where I've had luck."
734117,craigdritchie,2012-10-03 02:04:00,1586,"Bronte is a sewer. Check your PM, Gray-Wolf."
734121,Rod Caster,2012-10-03 03:18:00,5784," Are the soil remediation activities completed at PC park? They found a lot of old, leaded gas in that area."
734123,northernpike56,2012-10-03 03:20:00,717,    lol nice
734155,hotsky,2012-10-03 12:35:00,400,Thanks guys. Any decent ponds that are worth checking out?  PM me if you don't want to share out here.
734288,HyperActive,2012-10-03 22:24:00,56,"I don't mean to hijack your post Grey but as a young teen my buddies dad used to take us to  place around the Woodstock area Haven Lake, Lake Haven or something like that. Back then it was always good fishing, been racking my brains trying to think of it so I thought I would post here to see if someone knows a place close to that name somewhat in that area.   Not to be confused with Park Haven on Highway 59 N,"
734290,northernpike56,2012-10-03 22:26:00,717,"waterford ponds, binbrook, 50 pt marina (PERCH!!!)  "
734304,HyperActive,2012-10-03 23:06:00,56," Hey Grey,  The name of the water I was thinking of is called Lakehart."
734335,hotsky,2012-10-04 01:26:00,400,"  Hyper Active, so that's around Woodstock area? I did a quick search but didn't come up with anything by that name."
734336,northernpike56,2012-10-04 01:32:00,717,  you won't be dissapointed if you go there...  bass pike crappie and the odd trout apperently (though i've never caught one)
734342,Christopheraaron,2012-10-04 01:55:00,3525," Have you seen any walleye? Last time I was there some people caught a very nice one around 20""."
734344,hotsky,2012-10-04 02:31:00,400,"No never caught walleye, I really don't think there are a lot of them there."
734381,Christopheraaron,2012-10-04 13:04:00,3525,"I know, just wondering how the population's doing."
734395,pikehunter,2012-10-04 14:58:00,1659,check your pm
734416,Hooked,2012-10-04 17:02:00,891,You don't have to confine yourself to the pond at 50pt.  You can fish in certain area's in the marina this time of the year and you can also fish off the rocks on the lake.  Both area's you can cath trout and salmon. You can also head down to Jordan Harbour or Port Dalhousie.  Another area you may want to check out the old Welland Canal in and around Dane City (by the John Deere plant).  Several different species there and not that far away either.  Good luck.
734423,northernpike56,2012-10-04 17:29:00,717,  LOL... there's like no walleye in there.
734453,Christopheraaron,2012-10-04 19:47:00,3525, Where are you talking about?
