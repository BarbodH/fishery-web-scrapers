733735,Luke V.,2012-10-01 12:55:00,286,"Well I got out on Friday afternoon. Was a great day. Somewhat cool, overcast with periods of sun, light wind. Perfect conditions. Loaded up and was on the water for 1:15 Went to my normal locations on the Lower Niagara River and the fishing was great. The bass are certainly in feeding mode, and are fattening up nicely for the winter. My buddy Matt came along with me, Unfortunately for him there was nothing he could do to boat a bass. It took over 5 hrs, for him to boat a fish and it wasnt a bass.   This is the first Pike I have ever had caught in my boat while on the Lower River. (maybe the are making a comeback) I have seen one other one that was caught two weekends ago from the same area and thats all for this year.  Bass for me were on fire, in all shapes and sizes      Heres an interesting action shot      Then just as the evening was coming to a close I boated a Monster. This is by far my PB 21 inches and thick! Heres a few pics.     Cool Release shot     Thanks for looking. Tight Lines"
