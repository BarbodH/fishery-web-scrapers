William Cheung, at the University of British Columbia, predicts that changes in the climate will continue to warm the world’s oceans. Fish will adapt by getting smaller.  I doubt I will still be fishing by 2050, but it's interesting reading in any case. Click here for the full report."
733832,Twocoda,2012-10-01 19:42:00,4130,Like Button pressed...lol...thanks for sharing
733854,kickingfrog,2012-10-01 21:13:00,8333,Big deal… my fish have been getting smaller already.
733894,EC1,2012-10-01 23:23:00,930,"Screw him and his report! I like my fish bigger and bigger!  Hopefully the freshwater fish in Canada are an exception, I'll be happy if climate change makes our bass grow like Florida largemouth! I'll also give up ice fishing for a year round softwater season as well!"
733990,Hoppy,2012-10-02 14:45:00,95, Ban outboards I need ice
734000,Musky or Specks,2012-10-02 15:28:00,2710,Fish will get smaller until they get off boatside
734031,craigdritchie,2012-10-02 18:45:00,1586,LOL ... ain't that the truth.
734040,mercman,2012-10-02 19:31:00,7054,Thats not the only thing getting smaller:w00t:
734070,chris.brock,2012-10-02 22:31:00,4053,"I read that today, my first reaction was that sounds like bad science, he's making alot of assumptions off the cuff"
734091,Rich Nelson,2012-10-02 23:41:00,332,Fish will get smaller due to warmer water temps? What a joke....
734115,Aaron Shirley,2012-10-03 01:57:00,655,Is that your excuse these days Craig? Hehe  Couldn't resist  It doesn't make sense to me. Warmer water will add longer growing seasons here...
734128,craigdritchie,2012-10-03 03:47:00,1586,"That's right Aaron! It's too warm! If it weren't for climate change, those trophy 11-inch smallmouth I manage to catch every now and then (no, really, it's true!) would weigh six pounds instead of six ounces.  Stupid global warming."
734141,bushart,2012-10-03 10:55:00,2628,"All joking aside  Not sure about the size thing  But this summer's heat and drought taught many, many, many anglers that typical summer patterns were changed  could be a permanent thing soon"
734320,Rich,2012-10-04 00:27:00,3927,I wouldn't worry. We'll  be out of fresh water by then anyway.
734357,Musky or Specks,2012-10-04 04:37:00,2710,One thing I'm worried about is the low water I've seen everywhere combined with more weeds than I've ever seen If we get an early ice and it stays all winter. Could have some serious winterkill this year
734377,Dabluz,2012-10-04 12:53:00,701,"It's not climate change that makes fish smaller.  Fish are getting smaller due to fishing pressure, diminishing water quality, invasive species and general decline in genetics.  I could explain further but it would take days of writing."
