One with a cleaner and one with a water repellant....  Applied it today  I tried pouring water on my suit in the basement.... and it practically bounced off my suit....  So far so good.... Suit looks brand new again...
734878,msp,2012-10-06 19:14:00,1336,I have been thinking of doing the same thing. Where can I purchase nikwax ?
734879,Fisherman,2012-10-06 19:15:00,7201,"Nikwax is definitely good stuff.  I use the stuff for winter boots, apply twice a year, no leaks and the leather doesn't suffer from road salt."
734920,mike rousseau,2012-10-06 22:41:00,4661,I bought the kit containing both bottles you need for $19.99 I believe...  Ordered from Cabelas...
734928,SirCranksalot,2012-10-06 23:08:00,3291, At an outdoor store. I bought mine at Sojourn in Barrie.
735008,blue pickeral,2012-10-07 10:56:00,267,"Mountain Equipment Coop sells it. Also has the product for down filled coats. If cleaning a down filled coat, a tennis ball or hackey sack put in the dryer with the coat fluffs up the feathers."
