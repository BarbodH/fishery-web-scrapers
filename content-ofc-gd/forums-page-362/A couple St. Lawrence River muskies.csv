734203,ehg,2012-10-03 16:36:00,2666," Nice muskies there. Fishing the St. Lawrence there puts you on classic patterned musky and potential world record size. Yes, that one has weird colouring on half.    Since you don't post pics last many years, was always curious if you caught any ski's over 48"" since you live up around Stony and Lower Buckhorn?"
734249,lew,2012-10-03 19:36:00,12766,"Yes Eric, I've been fortunate and after 40 years of chasing muskies I've boated alot of fish between 48 @ 50 and even a few Kawartha fish over 50, although 50+ is rather infrequent in this area.  Strange as it seems though, I'm on Clear and just a short run from Stoney, but I almost never fish either lake and spend most of my time now on Chemong, Upper Buck & Pigeon."
734250,lew,2012-10-03 19:41:00,12766,"OOPs, I posted something in the wrong thread, sorry bout that..."

734282,migs,2012-10-03 22:12:00,4,Nice fish and story. Anytime is a good time
734287,ehg,2012-10-03 22:24:00,2666,"Again, those St. Lawrence muskies are awesome!  Surprised you fish so little of Stony,Lovesick,Lower Buck have heard good things there. Was just curious as you don't post fish since you live in that area."
734291,lew,2012-10-03 22:28:00,12766, Just too many musky stories end up going down the tube lately Eric so I  don't usually bother posting much anymore.
734296,MCTFisher9120,2012-10-03 22:48:00,3761,"Awesome report Lew, the day I decide to Musky fish I'll be giving you a call  Thanks for sharing,  MTBF"

734307,lew,2012-10-03 23:16:00,12766,Great picture Mike and thanks for giving me back my boat
734308,mike rousseau,2012-10-03 23:19:00,4661, I considered pushing you over the side and keeping it... Lol  But then you probably wouldn't come back...
734309,lew,2012-10-03 23:34:00,12766,"I'll be back as always Mike, just so long as you don't force anymore of those Philly samiches on me"

733863,Dutch,2012-10-01 22:14:00,831,Nice - thanks for sharing Lew.
733877,Stoty,2012-10-01 22:35:00,2910,Beauty fish Lew!!! Tanks!
733883,MJL,2012-10-01 22:57:00,2427,Sweet! Looks like an amazing weekend  Really loving the 7th picture.
733893,Lungelarry,2012-10-01 23:19:00,294,"Lew,say it ain,t so.....................your trolling"
733896,lew,2012-10-01 23:28:00,12766, Every once in awhile I slip over to the dark side Larry
733901,walleyejigger,2012-10-01 23:39:00,876,"very nice,  never fished for muskie so may be a dumb question but bare with me. What is the purpose of having the rods in the water like that? I guess you know you have a fish when you hear the drag peeling? thx"
733910,mistyriver1,2012-10-01 23:49:00,600,"Beauties Lew !  I haven't fished there since the late 80's, early 90's.  My Dad and I used to fish around St. Anicet and Ste. Barbe.  St. Anicet was always a little more wind friendly as the lake wasn't as wide around that stretch. Got to get back there again.  Congrats and looking forward to finally getting a ride in that skeeter down at St. Clair.  Jim"
733913,Handlebarz,2012-10-02 00:10:00,3790,Great report Lew glad you guys had a great time.
733915,Rizzo,2012-10-02 00:22:00,4754,"well done Lew and Mike, those are some gorgeous fish!"
733919,Roy,2012-10-02 00:27:00,13728," The main purpose is to keep your bait cleaner longer so you waste less time cleaning weeds off you lures. The rod in the water picks up weeds so that they don't travel down your line to your bait. Also, if you're fishing close to the boat, your bait will travel a couple of feet deeper compared to what it would if you had the rod in a standard trolling position.  ps. There are no dumb questions."
733921,mercman,2012-10-02 00:34:00,7054,Lew It was an absloute pleasure to meet you.You are one of the members i respect most here. Tite lines to you always.
733927,Fish Farmer,2012-10-02 00:53:00,2234,"Nice fish Lew, I'll catch the bait for you if you like   Be nice if we had a couple those girls in the river. The only thing my tackle is a little on the light side"
733931,Moosebunk,2012-10-02 01:08:00,3970,Muskie Guru Lew does it again!  Solid couple days young feller!  Great skis!
733936,Beans,2012-10-02 01:19:00,3339,"Nice lunge Lew !...  Don't hear them called that much anymore...my granddad wouldn't know what you were talking about if you called them ""musky"""
733937,Whopper,2012-10-02 01:22:00,2174,"Well done fellas, some nice looking fish!"
733966,lew,2012-10-02 11:01:00,12766," How'd you guys make out Paul, any luck with the pickerel ??"

733970,mistaredone,2012-10-02 12:02:00,913,Solid fish!  Love the 50/50 markings
733997,mercman,2012-10-02 15:15:00,7054,"  Yup.....caught this nice girl. Not sure but the sores on its side, i believe, is VHS.Have caught a few bass in the St Lawernce that have the same thing on them.Red, bloody leisions. "
734001,lew,2012-10-02 15:29:00,12766,"Nice one Paul, great to see you had some luck out there.  Good yakkin with you & Mike too after all this time."

734116,captpierre,2012-10-03 02:03:00,2521,"Couple of nice girls, Lew.  You look like you were trolling pretty fast.  What speed were you going?"
734118,Aaron Shirley,2012-10-03 02:07:00,655,Very nice muskies
734139,lew,2012-10-03 10:05:00,12766, Mostly around 4-5 MPH
734153,Harrison,2012-10-03 12:32:00,2202,"Nice to see shots of you, muskie and your smile again Lewskie."
733712,lew,2012-10-01 09:53:00,12766,"We always do a fall musky trip to the St. Lawrence River and Mike Rousseau (formerly Musky Mike) said he'd like to join us this year. Turned out my regular partner couldn't make it this time so Mike and I decided to hook up anyways.  I hauled my boat down  to Eastern Ontario Friday afternoon, booked into my favorite B&B for the weekend and then met Mike at the boat ramp Saturday morning.  The day started off slow but after a few hours of trolling Mike hooked into the 1st fish. A tough girl that pulled out 25' of tight drag when she hit. It took a few seconds to cut the hooks free so Mike decided to err on the side of caution and not worry about taking a picture.  We trolled another 30 minutes and then it was my turn with this girl. She hit the bait and immediately came 3' outta the water which is always fun to see, specially in the colder water.  Fast pic and she was off again.    We fished till dusk then called it a day and headed in while we watched the sunset which is always a great way to top off a successful day on the water.    Sunday morning we headed for Quebec waters to giver another shot.  A couple hours into the troll and this pretty lady hammered my bait. Another great fight, a couple pics and off she went with a wag of her tail and a wave goodbye.      I always try to be gentle with my muskies but some times the ladies don't appreciate it and get a bit nasty. I spose it's only fair for them to take a few shots back every now & then.    This girl had some really unique colours on her too. There was an almost straight line down her back with different colours on either side, even her stripes changed 1/2 way down her side.  Very nice looking fish.      That was it for the weekend but we had a great time together and hopefully we'll do it again next year.  Pretty sure Mike became a convert though and realized how nice full windshield boats really are. He started driving my boat Saturday morning and and never gave it back to me until we were finished on Sunday    Saturday afternoon we ran into Mike the Pike and Mercman out on the water so we shot the bull with them for awhile too.  Good meeting you boyz !!  It was 800 Km of driving for 2 days of fishing but it was well worth it. Lotsa laughs, some good food, good times, and a few nice fish to go along with it"
733713,Skipper D,2012-10-01 10:03:00,1970,"You look good on the Larry there Lew ..... lol , great bunch of guys over that way hu , and the fishings not bad too .... lol , good to see yous done well ."

733725,Rod Caster,2012-10-01 11:39:00,5784,Thanks for posting Lew. That half n half musky is certainly a unique looking lady.
733726,Roy,2012-10-01 11:59:00,13728,"Hey Lew, what were the water temps like there on the weekend? Low/mid 50's maybe?"
733728,lew,2012-10-01 12:10:00,12766,"Thanks guys, it was an enjoyable weekend for sure.   Actually Roy, temps were 63-64.  Pretty choppy on Saturday but not so bad Sunday.  We lucked out with the rain though as it stayed away all day Saturday and then started early Sunday but stopped before we hit the water. Started up again Sunday just as I got the boat loaded on the trailer and then pretty well rained all the way home.  Can't ask for better than that."
