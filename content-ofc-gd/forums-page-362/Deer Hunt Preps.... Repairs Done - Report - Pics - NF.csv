733511,Leecher,2012-09-30 00:47:00,7832,"Today, brother and I planned on heading up to our hunting grounds early and repair his ground blind that was in much needed repairs    3 sections needed to be replaced because of water damage and got it all done  This time around, there was no ATV to haul our stuff up the hill so I new it was going to be hard work ahead of us   Left home around 7h30am... pit stop for some hot brew and the way we go   Got back at 5h30pm  Weather wise, couldn't ask for a better day    Kind of chilly early in the morning with temps at 4C and moderate winds.... as the day progressed, went up to 16C  Did not forget my camera this time and snapped a few pics for your viewing pleasure Hope you enjoy!!! TJunkie  Trail going up to our blinds    This where we got stuck last week    One of the boulders    Up on top    Trail leading to my blind    A little further... Can you see it?    Again front view, much clearer this time    Shots of the feeder... Corn as been dissamated but not the carrots      Three sections needed to be replaced (top, back and part of one side) Here after it was all removed... Happy brother    Top view    Part of one side    After hauling our stuff from the trailer up the hill and getting busy installing new plywood, pleased to say that the repairs are 100% done and water proof    View of the back    View of the entrance side... even built a ladder to get in  "
