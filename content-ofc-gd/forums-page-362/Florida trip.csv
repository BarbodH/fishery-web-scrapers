734378,davew3,2012-10-04 12:54:00,430,Check out these 2 sites.  I have been researching myself for a trip down there.  http://www.cyberangler.com/fishing-reports/florida/  http://www.islamoradasportfishing.com/florida_keys_fishing_reports.htm  and take a trip down to Key West for some evening fun.  Regards
734411,captpierre,2012-10-04 16:35:00,2521,Lots of charter guys down there.  Small or party boats.  Went 2 yrs ago but were unable to go out due to winds.  They seem to catch a lot and variety
734736,Dutchy,2012-10-05 21:10:00,416,I've been out of Miami Beach and Clearwater many times. Pretty much any of the party boats are going to be good value ($50 or so for 4 hrs). Problem is they tend to catch lots of smaller fish cause they hit reefs etc. Still alot of fun. Just pick one and do it. They are all the same pretty much  in my experience.
