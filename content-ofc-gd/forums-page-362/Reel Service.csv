734880,Sour_Squirrel,2012-10-06 19:21:00,196,I have a Daiwa Fuego 2000 spinning reel.   It's one of the older red coloured magnesium bodied reels. The rotor and handle doesn't spin as free and smooth as it once did. Also the bail doesn't trip as nice as it did before.    
734940,ttahhan,2012-10-07 00:26:00,191,"Here's some info on your reel, if it has not been sand damaged then......find the access port and apply 2 drops of oil in it, then take off your spool and apply 1 drop on the bearing as well.... hope this helps....   Exploded Parts View  Reel Butter"
