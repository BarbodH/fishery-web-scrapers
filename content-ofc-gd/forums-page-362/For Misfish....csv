Last year we didn't have a good snowfall until the middle of November, the 14th if I remember correctly.  I've heard reports from 8cm over the weekend to well over 20cm. We'll see I spose.  Walleye time!!!!!      and what I just had to fill my belly before I head out fishing. Walleye breaded with croutons  then baked with onion. MMMMMMm   "

734522,Roy,2012-10-04 23:42:00,13728,I can do without that stuff for another while too.   That'd be baby corn.The chips are out of camera range.
734531,Joeytier,2012-10-05 00:07:00,3990,You must not be eating your vegetables!  Baby corns are delicious.  Possibility of snow in the bay by sunday or monday last I saw.
734603,manitoubass2,2012-10-05 03:24:00,11391,"lol, yeppers, thats baby corn. Only problem was I didn't make enough of it!  Well it's still snowing. Had the river all to myself today, not one boat in site. Fished for a few hours and had fun. Steady action but no big girls today. She was pretty cold out on the water with 65km/h windgusts and snow/sleet blowing up in my face!!!! I love fishing that dirty nasty weather .  Afterwards I took the kids to the gym, played some basketball and volleyball with the local kids, then had a workout. Came home and made a nice big ol bowl of some leftover homemade chilli and a beer.   Perfect day, time for bed"
