700129,mike rousseau,2012-05-27 19:25:00,4661,"the way i look at it... a new 16 foot aluminum...bare bones...basically a row boat... with a trailer and a 25hp 2 stroke with no electronics...no seats other then benches...no lights...no bilge...no switches or fuse panel...etc...etc... goes for $6,000 or more...  i personally think this used package is a more valuable  boat then the new one i have described above...  just some food for thought...  but hey...as far as your concerned... go as low as you can...   ..."
700155,SlowPoke,2012-05-27 20:50:00,2984,"Just to confuse the issue a little more... As far as I know, that motor should have an oil reservoir and won't run if it's low on oil. If it was clean and running, I would say $6000-$6500"
700162,Terry,2012-05-27 21:00:00,14456,well I am hoping  its worth 8000.00 or my boat just lost a thousand or so
700202,aplumma,2012-05-27 22:02:00,6896,"I would agree on a price for the boat as is + he fixes the motor with you paying the first $500.00 in repairs. I would suggest both of you be there when you talk to the mechanic so it is repaired completely to both of your satisfaction. I am not sure what the going price of the boat is up there however there are always great deals to be found I purchased a 1989 Ranger with a 150 that was not running right for $2200.oo and put a grand in seats, motor parts and electronics. The end result is as good as new even though it is 23 years old age is not a factor as much as was it cared for.   Art"
700262,Billy Bob,2012-05-28 00:05:00,5865,I guessing Randy is no longer interested as the first post was March 24th....but I wouldn't give a dime over 4k
700264,SlowPoke,2012-05-28 00:16:00,2984,   I'm guessing he is still interested since he bumped it 2 days ago.
700268,Billy Bob,2012-05-28 00:32:00,5865, Ewwwwww........missed that........good catch on your part....that could be the catch of the day.....
700297,Muskieman,2012-05-28 01:28:00,2472,"I'm going to see him again tomorrow , I will show him these posts , hopefully we can agree on a happy medium . ..  I'm willing to take the chance .. I'll probably trade in a repaired 75 Mariner and my 2001 Tracker SGV 14-T w 1998 30hp Evinrude on a 90 or 115 E-Tec ... I hope all goes as planned ... I find that it's a little underpowered with the 75 ..it apparently runs very well but with a little knock. ... Wish me luck !  Thank You !  Randy "
700300,Muskieman,2012-05-28 01:30:00,2472,The engine is a worry but .. The boat itself is like new .
700326,SlowPoke,2012-05-28 02:48:00,2984," If you with stay with Merc you should be able to keep the current controls. If you have your heart set on the E-TEC, do the research 90 vs 115. The consensus is more bang for the buck + built-in oil reservoir on the 90."
700564,dave524,2012-05-28 21:58:00,4508," Depending on what you pay for it and the cost of upgrading to more horses you are probably going to be at this dollar figure, looks just as clean, maybe a little bigger hull, will defintely run over 40 mph and a great looking colour coordinated bimini, kicker is extra. Honestly, I think the 75 will be fine on that boat.  http://london.kijiji.ca/c-cars-vehicles-boats-watercraft-powerboats-motorboats-Must-Sell-W0QQAdIdZ383028874"
700568,SlowPoke,2012-05-28 22:08:00,2984, Too bad it's sold
702482,joesmink,2012-06-03 20:34:00,3,"  I paid 6000 for a similar boat; 1988 starcraft mariner 210 cc with a 1988 ninety horse mariner with no riggers. Absolutely love my boat I get 30 mph on gps and the motor runs great. I like the idea of agreeing on a price and then the two of you going to the mechanic and your paying the first 500 then your friend deducts any more expence from what you agreed to pay for the boat. My 90 is 32 years old and runs fine I was lucky to buy this boat from the original owner and believed him to be upstanding about its condition and care and I didn't have to worry about it going through a bunch of different owners and who knows what. Offer4500 and you pay 500 towards engind repair,  seems like a good deal!"
702595,HTHM,2012-06-04 03:04:00,4082,"I have a line on a, I believe, new in crate 115 Yamaha 4 stroke. Not current year."
734312,Muskieman,2012-10-03 23:53:00,2472,I never bought it ... !!!!  5K gets it !  message for details ...
734548,John Bacon,2012-10-05 00:44:00,3277," From my understanding, if the Mariner was made in the USA then it is identical to a Mercury.  If it was made in Japan then it is a different motor; probably made by Yamaha but not necessarily the same as an actual Yamaha brand."
679334,Muskieman,2012-03-24 16:18:00,2472,"A friend of mine has this boat for sale....  He has no clue wht to sell it to me for... neither do I.  it's a 1995 Starcraft 1700 Walleye edition... fully loaded with an older 55 Minn Kota cable steer. 3 new batteries and 2 depth finders, 2 Scotty down riggers and a few more things along with all the safety gear.  the motor is a 1995 Mariner 75hp 3 cylinder ( 131 hours )that needs a main bearing in the middle piston ( ran out of oil ) I seen the repair estimate and it comes in at 475$... other than that the boat is immaculate..  He has to sell it to me for more than he paid for it ( 20 $ ) He won it in the OFAH lottery along with a new Jeep in 1995..  Now, without ripping each other off, what would be a fair offer on this unit ?     Randy "
679341,Nipfisher,2012-03-24 16:39:00,2449,"Randy, That is a nice little boat package.  I have a 1993 Starcraft 170C Walleye Edition with a 1995 Yamaha 90hp on it. It came with 1 old fish finder and a 36 lbs. thrust motorguide cable steer bow mount 2 batteries, and some gear. I got itfor a ""friend price"" and I would think yours should be a bit more then mine. That boat is 2 years newer, has the down riggers and is in better condition. I think a fair ""friend price"" would be $4000 - $4500. On the market I figure he could get around $6500 - $7500. You should be able to get $2500 for yours."
679344,Muskieman,2012-03-24 16:43:00,2472,"Thanks Blair .. But I'm keeping my Tracker .... I'm thinking that it's a little underpowered with the 75 , what would be top speed WOT ?"
679345,Sinker,2012-03-24 16:47:00,8692,"Ya, 36 mph would be pushing it. Maybe on a calm day, with just the driver, and an empty fuel tank with the wind at your back, going downhill.  It would run 30 no problem though, I would think.  Its a nice boat, a buddy of mine has one just like it with a 90 Mariner. It fishes real nice too.  If you can get that for $5G, your going real good.  S."
679346,musky66,2012-03-24 16:48:00,273," I like it, I have a 98 Superfisherman 17' with a Yamaha 115 and it is a great package- easily towable and handles pretty rough water to boot. Good luck."
679355,Nipfisher,2012-03-24 17:06:00,2449,  Ya I get 40-42 mph alone in my boat on a calm day with a 90hp. Max out at 38 mph in a chop with another person in boat. My guess is that boat is rated for up to 115hp so a 90-100 would match it well. I just searched Ontario kijiji and CAN'T BELIEVE the asking price for 17' Aluminum Starcraft packages.  I remember researching mine and it was rated really high in the US as a utility boat. Wide beam and deep hull is good for rough water.  Mine has live well up front and a split bait well in the back. One thing I miss is the rod locker was removed when the boat was re carpeted.   Does that boat have the split transom (tree is blocking the other side)? Mine is designed to fit a short or long shaft kicker.
679411,Live2fish85,2012-03-24 19:50:00,1633,"I can't see it doing that speed, my friends got a 17'5 Lund Mr. Piker with a 115 and with the two of us and full tank it goes 40-42 mph.  Regardless sounds like a great boat."

699687,glen,2012-05-25 23:34:00,2641,What it is worth.  Motor $1000 Trailer $1000 Boat $5000  A fare price for both of you $4500.  If it is forsale let me know.
699689,glen,2012-05-25 23:34:00,2641,Offer $3500.

699697,Muskieman,2012-05-25 23:51:00,2472,I'd feel guilty at 3500$

699734,Nipfisher,2012-05-26 01:43:00,2449,Pretty sure my 1st reply is bang on. Offer $4000-$4500 and as a friend he will take it. Probably worth $6500 - $7500.
699741,Dutch,2012-05-26 02:08:00,831,"In the end you are buying an almost 20 year old vessel, regardless of the shape it is in, or the number of hours on it, with a already required $500 fix.  Makes you wonder what else may be involved.  Id suggest $4,500 - $4,800 if you have to pay for the fix  Don't forget about taxes - an extra cost on top of what you pay."
699751,SlowPoke,2012-05-26 02:50:00,2984,"FWIW, I sold my '87 18' Starcraft CC for $6,000 a month ago. It had a 75 Mariner and would do 34mph fully loaded/fueled with 2 in the boat. A 75 will do fine but that boat rocks with a 90. Very nice ride."
699752,Pigeontroller,2012-05-26 02:51:00,2793,"I'd be nervous about that engine...""Ran out of oil""?"
699806,dave524,2012-05-26 11:37:00,4508," Ditto , hate to see you pay a good dollar and that bearing is just the tip of the iceberg when they get into it."
700048,Fish Farmer,2012-05-27 13:38:00,2234,"My thought also. How does he know middle bearing, must have had it apart plus what other damage with the NO OIL thing. Plus it's a Mariner, they don't make them anymore."
700054,mike rousseau,2012-05-27 14:16:00,4661,"if the motor get fixed and runs great...  then minimum $5000 for a boat like that... comparable boats in the states are going for $6000-$10,000...now most of those had slightly bigger engines so id say for him to list at $6500-$7500...  but for you id use the motor issue to you favor and id try to get the package for around $5000"
700062,landry,2012-05-27 14:41:00,1005,   As it is now though - I would say 4000 is fair if he is a friend and it needs work. It will likely cost u 1000 more somehow after u buy it.

700087,JamesG,2012-05-27 16:36:00,32,"make sure to make differnt receipts for the boat, motor and trailer...   it'll save on taxes.  If the engine is not apart i'm unsure how the mechanic could tell it was only 1 cylinder that was damaged.. little or no compression? a nock noise?  is the paint burnt or peeling on the engine block? if it is, i'd think there is more damage or since you are friends, maybe you could get it to the marina have it taken apart and make sure its just the one bearing and then make an offer.  looks like a nice ride.  btw i have a 16.5ft lowe with a 1999 90 mariner and it'll run 42mph 2 ppl and full tank of gas"
700103,bigbuck,2012-05-27 17:52:00,2449,"4-4.5k. That's it. It needs motor work. Who knows what is going to be found once its opened up. Count on at least a grand to fix the engine. Once its apart, the rings and pistons may as well be changed on the other cylinders and it may need To be bored and honed. How old are the batteries?? Electronics?? Etc......"
