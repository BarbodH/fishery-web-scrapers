732978,bigcreekdad,2012-09-27 02:00:00,546, I might try to make it up around the 8th. I'll watch the weather....might stay at Bryer Lodge...hope to see you.
733021,Gallie,2012-09-27 12:17:00,1215,"Hey guys. Im heading up to bryer lodge on the 12 for my first time on the french. I have done some muskie in scugog and the kawarthas but i would like to see some better numbers. Myself and some buddies went to the moon river basin the last two years for 3 days each time and we did not SEE a muskie. I have 2 guys in my boat who have never caught one. I have a cradle, cutters, gloves, and pliers and a small assortment of lures. I was wondering if you guys had any tips on lures or depths that you could help me with? I would like to get these guys on a ski no matter the size. Thank you for your time. Tightlines"
733024,Gallie,2012-09-27 12:22:00,1215,One more thing i forgot to mention. Every muskie regardless of size will be released from my boat. I have watched my favorite pike lakes be demolished and i would never keep a large pike or muskie that can help restock. Thanks
733039,Rich Clemens,2012-09-27 13:42:00,3131,THAT'S NOT FAIR .....  I wanna come back up again.     I seem to be on a bit of a roll. Ya'll have a great time and I want to see lots of pics of really BIG fish.  The three I caught on the North Channel of the French were all on a Double Cow-Girl.   Black Skirt and Nickel. Blades.  This has been my go-to lure the past two years and is doing quite well for me.  All of mine came while fishing cabbage beds - burning the lure over the top.  Best of luck guys - go get 'em
733068,Gallie,2012-09-27 16:14:00,1215,Thanks for the tip. I have a #10 vibrax black blade and skirt would that work as well?
733171,F_ast,2012-09-28 02:25:00,154,"Rich, how did the weeds look on Wolseley?  I have found this time of year that most of the fish up there relate to rock or current this time of year.  I have seen fish the cabbage, but non that are aggressive eaters.  If there is weed on a rock spot, that is a good sign.  I also know that spot where you caught that decent pike.  The muskie I have got out of there have all come from the outside of that shoal and around that point that goes into that deep channel between the islands.  Gallie,  Look for pebbled shore lines, and the most diverse structure possible.  Everything on the French looks like it should hold muskies, but you really have to pick your spots. Areas that have alot of walleye fisherman on them tend to always hold muskies too... so if you see that, fish it. Shoals, relatively shallow points that project into deep water, sand flats with bowlders and light current areas will be your most productive spots.  I will be at Wolseley tomorrow night... Black Lund Predator 2010ss"
733187,Rich Clemens,2012-09-28 10:16:00,3131," The weeds seem consistent as in past years - at least on the spots that I have fished before.   The sand bar at the launch there at Wolseley is less than a foot under the water now, so you have to be careful when launching / loading - and go out around it.  Saw more than one boat churn up the sand and mud there.  The only ""real"" hit that I had, fishing out of Wolseley, came off a small point on an island with a rocky shoal and some weeds around it. Not a big area, but it looked good.  Fishing purely cabbage beds (no rocks) - I saw nothing at all that wek.    Strange though - I fished the same kind of structure at Rainbow Camp and nailed 3."
733191,Gallie,2012-09-28 10:50:00,1215,Thanxs for the help fast. Ill try to pick and choose my spots. I was going to try a good bit of trolling big cranks and stopping to cast at goid lookin spots
733192,migs,2012-09-28 10:51:00,4,"Gallie, The Hamilton Chapter of Muskies Canada is holding an outing on Wolseley Oct.12-14. There will be lots of boats around to get tips from. I'll be in a 16' Starcraft with tiller stop by if you see me. We'll be staying at Totem Point Lodge"
733195,Rizzo,2012-09-28 11:08:00,4754," got some bad news for you. Kawarthas not uncommon to have a 3 fish day. French not uncommon to have a 3 fish week. Not the place for numbers in my opinion, but a place for bigger fish (ie heavier)"
733197,Rich Clemens,2012-09-28 11:21:00,3131,"  I would agree here too. I heard the Kawarthas is good if you are looking on quantity.  I've heard fish in the 30's/40's are common, but not the really big girls.  Never fished the Kawarthas, but I love the Canadian Shield and I'm looking for that elusive 50"" - and I know they are up there. One of these years."
733274,Gallie,2012-09-28 18:11:00,1215,"I would like to get a 50 myself, my pb is a 46 out of scugog but im trying to get the other guys a fish each. As long as we get at least 1 it will b worth the trip. Sounds like there will b quite a few boats out there hopefully theres some left : )"
733276,Gallie,2012-09-28 18:14:00,1215,Hey migs ill either b in my 12 ft tinny w a merc or my buddies 16 ft with a 70 vro. Look for two big boys and a skinny 1
734823,Sour_Squirrel,2012-10-06 12:48:00,196,Nice fish!! I used to catch the odd one up there years ago using a good old classic Mepps Musky Killer in a Blue or Orange blade.   
734826,esoxansteel,2012-10-06 13:08:00,1307,"   Yes theres no 50s in the Kawartha's, they have been genetically altered to stop growing at 49 1/2, so you should try the big water and its tributaries that flow into it, and stay off the Kawartha's"
734827,bigcreekdad,2012-10-06 13:11:00,546,"  I have found orange to work well on the French. The only lure I troll (when I do, and it's not that often), is a large orange spinner bait....two muskies (largest 43"") and a mid 30's pike on it. I've also had success with a bucker tail....orange blade and black bucktail."
731947,bigcreekdad,2012-09-23 16:43:00,546,
731948,lew,2012-09-23 16:50:00,12766,"Nice chunky fish for sure, congrats  !!"
731949,Rich Clemens,2012-09-23 16:51:00,3131,"Heard you got one and waiting to see the pic.  I tried a top raider and patsy gave a suick a try one evening, but no takers.  Glad to see you got one.  Love to see the big girls."
731950,mike rousseau,2012-09-23 16:54:00,4661,Nice catch...  That's a fatty....
731951,bigcreekdad,2012-09-23 16:57:00,546,"  I love topwater....my only two landed this year were on them. Conditions have to be right though.....those darn sunny, still days don't work. After dinner, it's the only lure I throw."
731952,Joey,2012-09-23 16:57:00,9122, I find that hard to believe
731953,Joey,2012-09-23 16:58:00,9122,"Oh, and nice fish BigCreekDad, nice fatty"
731962,Gregoire,2012-09-23 18:05:00,1397," I would not hesitate to throw a topwater lure at any time of day, out of any position in the boat, but that is just me.  Really nice and fat fish."
731963,John,2012-09-23 18:08:00,2956, :whistling: 
731964,John,2012-09-23 18:11:00,2956,Nice fish BigCreekDad...I will be up there in a couple of weekends..
731965,misfish,2012-09-23 18:13:00,29133,Glad Im not the only one with his mind in the gutter.  :rofl2:  Nice fish
731967,Andrew Grant,2012-09-23 18:15:00,201,.
731969,Rich Clemens,2012-09-23 18:17:00,3131,Hey !!!!!!   It spell checked better than suick did.   Stoopid phone fixes the words a bit.
731972,John,2012-09-23 18:25:00,2956, Glad you guys had a great time Rich. Hope I do as well in a couple of weeks.....
731985,mercman,2012-09-23 19:13:00,7054,Wow !!!! Thats a fat bottomed girl if i ever saw one!!!
731996,bigcreekdad,2012-09-23 20:48:00,546,
731998,Handlebarz,2012-09-23 20:58:00,3790,Fatty for sure  Them top raiders work all times of the day not early and late.
732007,mistyriver1,2012-09-23 21:30:00,600,"Nice fish man, congrats.  If your camera has a delayed timer u can still get in the picture with your fish.  I do it all the time."
732018,F_ast,2012-09-23 21:56:00,154,"Yes, that and laying a muskie on your carpet is pretty bad for the fish.  Pulls their slim right off.  Nice fish though. Looks like they are eating up there."
732020,Christopheraaron,2012-09-23 22:14:00,3525, sorta like stupid?
732021,bigcreekdad,2012-09-23 22:14:00,546,
732031,davey buoy,2012-09-23 22:54:00,5505,I new there was something different about that carpet!.
732058,bigcreekdad,2012-09-24 01:07:00,546, Dan...that's because you are the eternal optimist....I'm a half empty guy myself.
732064,Gregoire,2012-09-24 01:31:00,1397,"That's because a hungry musky is an apex predator that will eat anything it wants to. Sometimes when a ski is looking skyward it will eat a topwater even though other appetizing lures may have passed right in front of it. Sometimes a large musky will eat a topwater in the middle of the day not because it's hungry, but because it can. It's kinda like a Chuck Norris thing."
732065,bigcreekdad,2012-09-24 01:42:00,546, Dan  Ahh....you have given me hope. Have you tried smoked muskie recently?
