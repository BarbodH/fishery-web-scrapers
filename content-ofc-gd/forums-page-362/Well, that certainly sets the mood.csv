734410,TennesseeGuy,2012-10-04 16:30:00,957,Take all of your warm clothes out on the lake with you.  Good luck with some huge fish.
734442,Crazy Ivan,2012-10-04 18:56:00,184," Ha Ha, I call it the 'in-fisherman' hold. Reach toward the camera and make the fish look huge.  Nice fish!"
734443,TJQ,2012-10-04 19:07:00,7806,Id say that would set the mood....  fish porn!!
734529,craigdritchie,2012-10-05 00:06:00,1586,"Nothing like fish pictures shot with a super-wide lens. Provided you keep your hands hidden, it makes any fish look like Moby Dick."
734565,Whopper,2012-10-05 01:44:00,2174,I don't care what kind of lense was used to capture that shot but knowing Ben that is still one hell of a fish.  I'd be tickled to death to be on my way to fish LS with Ben
734579,Moosebunk,2012-10-05 02:05:00,3970,Photoshopped!!!  Joking Bennie!  You're a slayer of fish in a world full of leviathans.  Props dood!  Another day at the office for ya!?!?!?

734668,ehg,2012-10-05 15:12:00,2666,"What a great trip that must be. Lac Seul with trapshooter as the guide for muskies. Apparently it is 3 degrees rain, snow and wind to add to the adventure."
734670,taper,2012-10-05 15:32:00,611,I can tell you from first hand experience this summer that Ben is 100% professional and will do everyting in his power to put you on fish.
