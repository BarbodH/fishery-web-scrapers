734660,RangerGuy,2012-10-05 14:59:00,564,"So I used to fish walleye/musky quite late in my old ranger. The motor a 89 60hp Johnson stroke was very good at self draining.  After pulling the boat out for the day I would leave the motor down for a few minutes and pull the kill switch, turn her over a few times. It would drain or kick out all the water no problem.  It seems to me my new yamaha holds much more water in the passages. I can pull the boat out, leave the motor down while packing everything up and then put the transom support bar and tow it home. When I get home and put the motor down again it dumps a lot of water out of this little hole in the front facing edge of the lower unit.   So I'm curious what everybody does late season once ice/snow starts to build up to prevent thier yamaha's from freezing and splitting s over night OR while anchored in sub zero temperatures?"

734750,Steve,2012-10-05 22:21:00,2075,"i've ran my yamaha 12 months a year for 9 seasons....  never had an issue.  just pull it out, trim'er down, let it drain....  just before i trim it back up to leave, i quickly turn it over to get out anything else...  after that, it sits in an unheated garage.  thats why you bought a yamaha. they are the best."
734752,davey buoy,2012-10-05 22:39:00,5505,"On a couple of my old outboards I use to put on the ear muffs.Add 2' garden hose with a large funnel.Fill up the funnel with a jug of plumbing antifreeze.Start the motor in idle,and before you know it,antifreeze out the tell tale and exhaust. Shut off before antifreeze runs out. Just a bit of extra insurance. Usually I would run the motor with water for 5 mins or so"" first"" to make sure thermostat is wide open if equipped. Done."

734812,bigbuck,2012-10-06 10:39:00,2449,"Enjoy it till you store it, then change the oil, the gear oil and stabilise the fuel and that should be about it for an outboard."
