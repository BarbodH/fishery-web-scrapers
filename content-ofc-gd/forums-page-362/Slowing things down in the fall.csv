Last time out I misses a fish on the eight, and I think if I would have slowed things down she may have ate. I am using a conquest currently, and am not burning the blades in, but I think the winch would force me to be just a bit slower. Especially with thge cold front rolling a slow approach may help. What do you musky guys think?"
