734947,FinS,2012-10-07 00:58:00,463,looking at a purchase on the 7'6 daiwa dmx any good or bad about it cant seem to find any reviews whatsoever and would it pair up good with a 400 corsair
734951,Gregoire,2012-10-07 01:35:00,1397,I have a Daiwa VIP rod that is ok. Not as nice as my compre. From looking at the specs it looks similar to the Compre but without the lifetime warranty. At that price point I think you are better off with the Okuma EVX rods which also have a lifetime waranty. All I can really say about musky rods is that if you ever buy a legent tournament everything else will feel like crap
