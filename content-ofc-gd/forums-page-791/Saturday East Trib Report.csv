380483,Who Da Man,2009-09-07 15:05:00,21,Hit a few east tribs on Saturday to see if there were any fish around but did'nt have a very sucessful trip.  The first spot the lawn chair anglers had already filled up the hole and the few fish that were there had been spooked.  Did'nt even bother taking my rod apart.  Looks like that hole has been overtaken by the lawn chair crowd until the salmon run dies down.  Headed upstream to see if any fish had pushed up but did'nt see anything.  4 years ago I saw one of the best runs on this system.  I'm curious to see if it can bounce back to those numbers but right now it doen't look like it.  On the way back checked out another trib and the water was low but had a nice chalk tinge.  Nothing in a few hours.  Check the dam and a few were trying to jump but not to many in numbers up yet.  Guess I'll have to wait for the next rain and push of fish.  Good Luck
