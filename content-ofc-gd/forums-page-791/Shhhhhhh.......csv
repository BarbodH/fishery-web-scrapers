380369,bassman87,2009-09-06 22:12:00,586,^^ Lol Great job StoneFly you helped feed his family.
380372,StoneFly,2009-09-06 22:43:00,574," Lol,..YUP,..but feed them what?  I cant be held responsible for the reprocussions,..ROTFLMAO  He said his wife cooks them in salt,...Whatever that means..."
380377,bassman87,2009-09-06 23:59:00,586,"Sounds YUMS, probably boiled them with a pinch of salt like lobsters lol. Were the ones you caught really bronzish or did they still have a quite bit of silver to them?"
380388,StoneFly,2009-09-07 00:42:00,574,"Well they were silverish, going on copper,..Lol,..not the freshest I have caught, but not the least either,..they had a load of E tho,..one of the first time I have seen mature salmon take air and they were hooked in the mouth. ..my guess is that they have been in the trib for about 4-5 days."
380390,Twocoda,2009-09-07 00:48:00,4130,i had one yesterday that spent more time out of the water then in and one tonight that didnt even break the surface after ten minutes fighting it ....until a guy next to me desided he should cross my line...lol...  the insanity is only beginning ...
380851,morrashi,2009-09-08 18:23:00,2,"Dear StoneFly,  Great job!  I had always doubt that salmon don't bite once they are up the river/creek during spawning. Anyway, you have proved it that they do bite if the bait is presented properly.  Did you use Barkly Grub? What was the size and color of the grubs, size of the hook, and how did you present them?  Many thanks."
380931,StoneFly,2009-09-08 21:34:00,574," Well just to be accurate, again these fish were pretty fresh and wont be spawning for a little while.  I wont even be heading out again until the next run.  All my hooks are #12-14, including the flies.  I bummed the grubs off another angler but I do believe they were Berkley, sorta off-white, grey in colour about 1' long.  Make sure you use a Flourocarbon leader.  As for the presentation, thats harder to explain, but just do everything you can to be in the strikezone and make sure that the first thing and hopfully only thing they see is your bait.  Good Luck."
380958,KelfuN,2009-09-08 23:25:00,246,black/olive wooly bugger has been the ticket so far for the past 3 weeks...easy 5+ fish days

380062,danbouck,2009-09-05 02:21:00,4380,"Your from Stoney Creek and Bronte seems dirty, checked the credit yesterday, nothing ... damn u tell me where they are!!!"
380070,bassman87,2009-09-05 02:42:00,586,"This was the only pod I seen though, sucks."
380071,bassman87,2009-09-05 02:43:00,586,"For that hour, LMAO."
380075,fishinguypat,2009-09-05 03:03:00,547,i have had this happen that you see the trout or salmon but how would you catch them in this situation?
380076,[emailÂ protected],2009-09-05 03:05:00,290," Get a friend, get 2 nets, go on both sides and then watch chaos ensue. "
380077,bassman87,2009-09-05 03:07:00,586,"Earplugs are a good enticer bait. Try purple or yellow, orange is killer when they aren't willing."
380081,CLofchik,2009-09-05 03:27:00,854,"Pffft, I doubt that pic was taken on Bronte or Credit, I don't see a single hook in their back!  This th'd needs some video...  "
380126,Greencoachdog,2009-09-05 12:29:00,8163,  
380133,Twocoda,2009-09-05 13:14:00,4130,with the water being that clear you might try a single egg or a stonefly with 2 or 4 pound test leader line.......is this pic and video footage current ( someone had to ask)
380148,bassman87,2009-09-05 14:18:00,586,Pic was taken Sept. 3rd.
380151,bigfish1965,2009-09-05 14:28:00,3382, LOL...Dawg you are a pain in the butt!! Just need a stick and a bonfire....
380156,johnnyb,2009-09-05 14:39:00,3413,Yup...the stick he uses for stirrin' and the fire...well...we all know he's fully flaming
380200,StoneFly,2009-09-05 19:45:00,574,"Stonefly's, Prince Nymphs, grubs and small red roe bags helped me go 0/4 today, lol.   Alll fish in the 20lb range,  they gave me a good 20 minutes worth of fun altogether though.  One broke my main line, one broke the leader and 2 straightened out hooks.  While I didnt bring a net, where I was standing for all 4, a net woulda helped me land all 4.  While trying to tail them,...my buddy actually touched my leader on 2,..does that make it 2/4...lol  The fish were few but movin around like crazy.  Only saw one other guy get one, but that was by the tail,..lol  Still a fun day!!!  Rain Rain Rain!!!"
380209,bassman87,2009-09-05 21:08:00,586,"Good job StoneFly, but I don't think the leader-touch rule applies here."
380361,StoneFly,2009-09-06 21:03:00,574," I think you are right, lol, and while it always adds to the satisfaction to be able to unhook the fish and release it yourself, it was a blast nonetheless.  What was even more rewarding is that there were 8 other guys fishing the hole that clearly only had 8-9 fish in over 2000 ft.sq. and I was the only one catching them, clean in the mouth each time.  Not to bring up a tiring topic, but I will argue that these salmon WILL strike in the right cicumstances when in the river.  I have proven it to myself countless times.  For example:  There are 4 fish in a lane that is about 300 sq ft.  they are swimming around aggressively.  Drift a white roe bag 20 times,..nothing, a yellow 20 times, nothing,...a red once,..bam, hit...., FEEEESH AWWWWNNNN.  A grub once, bam, a grub twice, bam, a grub 3x, bam, a grub 4x, bam,..Feeeeesh AWWWWWNNNNN.  The same applies to the prince.   I love swtching it up and getting a hit on the first drift..., that is KEY!!!  The 3 long fights all occured within one hour and Im sorry to say that the entire pool was spooked out after that.  So even though it was 0/4, it was 4/10 or so for what was available, lol.  The one that broke my mainline was snagged about 20 minutes later by another guy doing the, ""big weight heavy line, let it sit and wait thing"" (i dont even know what its called), but once he netted that fish, I went over to have a look (and get my float back, lol) and my hook and red mesh were in the fish's mouth, I congratulated him (  ) and he said he was keeping the fish as he handed my float back and I could see in his eyes he felt guilty.  Noticing it was a male I just   and said, ""if I land a female, do you want to eat her?""  and his eyes lite up.  He said in broken english, ""I land this fish, but what you did was AWESOME, thanks for fighting her out for me"".  I just laughed.  Open invitation to all the non-beleivers and Naysayers to see for yourself.  RAIN RAIN RAIN!!!!"
