380348,Mattitude,2009-09-06 18:09:00,155,I thought it was cool that after 60+ years that bakery is on the same corner.  I didn't realize how much stucco until now!  If you look close in a few of the new photos you can see what looks like the old bullets holes and shrapnel damage.

380617,kickingfrog,2009-09-07 23:56:00,8333,"I work at a retirement home a few days a week. One of gentleman there was 25 years old and living in England when Great Britain declared war with Germany 70 years ago on Sept 3rd (yes that means he is 95 now). He hasn't talked about the war itself much, but he has been telling me stories of the radio broadcast that they would listen to as Churchhill would speak to the country. Fascinating and horrifying all at once.  I was so taken by his stories that I looked up Winston Churchill's speeches on the net.  Here is one of the speeches my friend mentioned by its famous four last words, pure Chuchill:  http://archives.cbc.ca/war_conflict/second..._war/clips/778/       Never again."
