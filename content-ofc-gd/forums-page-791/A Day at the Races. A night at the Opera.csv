380767,Bernie,2009-09-08 13:05:00,3190,"On Sunday my son and a young fellow who works with me entered their cars in a demolition derby at our local fall fair. It is a definite crowd pleasing event with probably a thousand or more people attending. Nick (my son) and Ash probably spend 40 hours each preparing their cars for a spectacle that destroys the buggy's in 10 minutes or less. They do it for fun as the prize money isn't near enough to cover the gas money alone. Ash was the first one in the ring for his entry in the 4 cylinder class. He got flagged out because an oil line took fire. Turned out it was residue oil from a line no longer needed. Nick's first heat he took a hit right away and it broke a tie rod end. But after a quick repair he re-entered the consolation event and won it. Great day and a lot of fun.  After the race a gang showed up at the cottage for a time to celebrate. Hence the ""Night at the Opera""  Nick and his GF, Miranda    Ash and his GF, Christine.    Glad to have a tent to keep the sun off.    A view of the track before a run.  "
