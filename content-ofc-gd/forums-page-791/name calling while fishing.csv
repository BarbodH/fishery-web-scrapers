380630,chinookhunter,2009-09-08 00:25:00,68,So everytime i go fishing people call me fat and say things like save the whales. just wondering if anyone else has been called names while fishing?
380632,Cudz,2009-09-08 00:28:00,2652,I've been called names before.  Usually after I fail to net a buddy's fish and managed to knock the lure out of the fish's mouth at the same time.
380633,Greencoachdog,2009-09-08 00:29:00,8163,Heck yeah!!!   ... down here in the South the call me Sir!
380635,kickingfrog,2009-09-08 00:30:00,8333,Not funny.
380638,bassman87,2009-09-08 00:39:00,586,Is that you in your display pic?
380641,chinookhunter,2009-09-08 00:40:00,68,I have a glandular problem its all genetics.
380642,Rizzo,2009-09-08 00:41:00,4754,"I always talk trash with my fishing partners...name calling, mother jokes, insults...helps the day go by when the fish aren't cooperating"
380647,ironstone74,2009-09-08 00:51:00,201,"It's not cool to call people names, obviously the name callers have some esteem/confidence/insecurity issues.  Keep fishing and forget the insulters - silence them by outfishing them, or ""accidentally"" knocking them into the drink!!!  Paul"
380652,chinookhunter,2009-09-08 00:56:00,68,Thank you I will its people like you that make this site great!
380659,CrankbaitJon,2009-09-08 01:04:00,13,"My close friends do alot of name calling when the fish aren't biting but its all in a fun manner.  Same thing with Cudz though, had an incident with a missed net attempt ending up with a fish taking off without the hook and people get angry for a few minutes  Jon"
380663,Cookslav,2009-09-08 01:10:00,1457,I've been known to call the fish a few names as they swim towards a log jam...or after they spit the hook.
380664,chinookhunter,2009-09-08 01:12:00,68,I am so sick of walking upwards of 100 yards to go fishing and be called names to the point where I have to walk all the way back to the car and drive home. no one else on here gets called names while fishing?
380670,Greencoachdog,2009-09-08 01:21:00,8163,  I like you're glandular signature!!!
380673,Lunatic,2009-09-08 01:28:00,536,"LMAO!!    i like the ""mmm food"" quote in your profile"
380676,Guest gbfisher,2009-09-08 01:34:00,0,"What kind of names would you like to read? I'm just curious of why you would think that anybody gets called names on a regular basis, while fishing. I'd think it was a regular thing really. How much do you weigh? Am gonna guess 800 pounds. Without measuring even or good scales. There's HEY _ _ _ _ _  you're on my spot. OR..Hey _ _ _ _ _ that's in the slot. or...You are on the wrong side of the marker buoy you idiot."
380677,bassman87,2009-09-08 01:34:00,586,This feels like a level.
380678,Syn,2009-09-08 01:35:00,519,"Accept yourself for who you are. People will name call other people because of their looks fat or skinny, pimple faced, old wrinkled skin, what clothes they wear, what car they drive, etc. You can't let them stop you from enjoying life. Life is too short to be stopped by someone name calling you.  We've all experienced name calling at some point in our lives.   or you can do like this guy and then maybe the name callers will be so freaked out that they'll be scared of you. Just totally freak out on them and yell at the top of you lungs while shaking your fists at them http://www.break.com/usercontent/2009/9/a-...ts-1201219.html"
