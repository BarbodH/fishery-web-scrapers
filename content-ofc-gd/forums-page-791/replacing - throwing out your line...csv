380776,Jet,2009-09-08 13:20:00,364,I collect mine in a bag and drop it off at Bass Pro for recycling.
380777,ohhenrygsr,2009-09-08 13:21:00,947,Yea just bring it to your local fishing store they will dispose of it
380778,kickingfrog,2009-09-08 13:27:00,8333,"Judging by some of the places I've fished, you just leave it on the shore.  Recycle it at a store that collects used fishing line, failing that, maybe burning it in a fire."
380788,Fishnwire,2009-09-08 13:56:00,983,"When I'm at camp I throw it in the wood stove.  I have a bag of it at home for when I do it there.  I bring it into the tackle shop for recycling every now and then, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if all the line they collect just ends up getting burnt somewhere eventually anyway.  Could they really recycle a bunch of different makes and types of line back into something like monofiliment?  You'd think the constituents of a product like that would have to be very closely controlled."
