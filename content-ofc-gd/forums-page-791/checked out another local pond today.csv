Well I got there put the tnner in and started to scout around. lots of lily pads,and the water was muddy looking (brown). I tossed a frog about 5 or 6 times then changed to a brown worm with yellow tip. the place is called little lake. i was thinking it might be a bit less fished just got to figure out what to use in it    it was 230 -330 when I was out there and a bit of wind . had my little girl with me so couldn't get too serious she just wanted a boat ride"

We used to go out there in a little two seater ""bass"" boat with just and electric motor and fish it all day.  I always used the smallest spinner bait I could get my hands on and we would catch 100 fish a day easily, lots of crappies and the occasional largemouth.   Nothing of major sizes, but there's huge quantity all around the outer edge."
