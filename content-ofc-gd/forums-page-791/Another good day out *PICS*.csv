We got out around 4pm and the boat traffic was insane!  We moved out to deeper water (25-30 feet) figuring it would push the fish deeper.  We caught a few small fish around 2-2.5 pounds, moved to a break from 22-28 feet and started getting into some better fish.  Landed 10 all together, all on tubes.  Lost 2 on a jerkbait.  My trolling motor blew out at around 7:15 and we headed in.  This thing has been giving me issues all season.  Oh yeah, we had smallies puking up gobies.  First time I've seen it out here!   My old man with a few nice fish   Smallies' new diet!"

380243,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-06 01:03:00,3761,"Nice job man! Can't wait to get out fishing again. What brand is your trolling motor?  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
380268,Cudz,2009-09-06 04:00:00,2652,nice day. Probably a goby but could be a sculpin.  I believe they are native to the lake.  I picked up a rock the other day and there was one laying under it.  It was darker than a gody but similar shape.
380277,Harrison,2009-09-06 11:03:00,2202,"Nice Steve, deep huh!  I've NEVER had a scuplin or goby spit up on Simcoe before  Cool pic.  Gives me a bit more confidence in some baits I was wanting to try.  Thanks for sharing that pic."
380278,Joey,2009-09-06 11:28:00,9122,"Nice report and pics Steve.  I'll be doing exactly the same thing today, taking my dad out for some smallies.  Hope I can put him on some.  Joey"
