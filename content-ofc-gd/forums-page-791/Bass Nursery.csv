There are dozens if not hundreds of little (two inches or less) bass that I can see when the light is right and the water calm.  Yes, I'm sure they're bass.  I have two questions though:  1)  Besides the juvenille smallies, there are several two pounders under that dock that instantly hammer whatever comes their way, with the exception of their younger brotheren.  They seem to pay no attention to one another.  I see the little ones right in the strike zone and the big ones leave them alone.  What's up with that?  It would make sense that they're genetically programmed to not be canibals, but how do they even recognize their own kind?  2)  Is there anything I could do to make the ""nursery"" more desirable or effective.  It's gravelly with few rocks, should I add a little structure or cover?  Is there anything I could fed them, or provide them with that might increase their survival rate?  Any theories?  Thanks."

Rocky bottoms are what smallies like to hide in, and the dock provides shade and an ambush point for the larger bass. Also keeps them out of the sun.  You there, my friend will probably have an outstanding year of smallie fishing in a few years"
