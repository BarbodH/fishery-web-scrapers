Got lots of work done but did manage to have some fun with the kids tubing and also got out fishing a few mornings!  The first morning I got up at 5:15 and headed straight for an island not too far from the cottage.  Spent a few hours casting senkos at the shore line which had lots of good structure and looked promissing for the nice bucket mouth I've been looking forward to getting this summer.  Senko wasnt' producing even a bite so I headed off to an area with lots of lilly pads and weeds and tossed the scum frog for awhile...still nothing.  Decided to finish off the morning trolling a bit in the hopes of getting a smallie, walleye or maybe even a muskey...still nothing.  Next time out I headed for the other side of the same island and decided to cast a wake bate in the open water (8' deep with weeds 3' from the surface) and landed this little guy in the first 15 minutes or so.  Not really picture worthy but after being skunked the first day I was happy to get something!  Continued that for an hour or so and got 2 others about the same size but then decided to head back to the slop on the other side of the island.  I was sure there had to be some nice ones in there and I have been looking forward to landing a nice bucket on the scum frog all summer but don't have any real good spots near my house.  I started casting a few around a fallen tree and had a strike on the second cast but tried setting the hood to quick and lost it.    Tried a few more time in the same area but couldn't get him to bite again.  I moved down a bit and casted just beside a little cluster of weeds and almost instantly had a blowup!  This time I paused for a few seconds and then gave it a good yank...this time I had him!  I started reeling in, he was putting up a good fight but then all of a sudden it felt more like a snag.  I was sure I lost him and was now hung up on a log so I releast some tension and instantly felt him swimming down.  I got it to the surface and dispite not having a net got him in the boat.  It wasnt' huge, but it was my PB at 3.4lbs and every bit as fun as I had hoped!    Sorry the pics aren't great as I was alone with only my blackberry camera.    Fished for a while longer and got this 1.7lber.  I do wish I had had a bit more time for fishing but it was a working vacation after all. We also did some family fishing of the dock and all four of my kids managed to catch at least one pan fish which made them happy as well although you wouldn't know it by the expression on her face.
