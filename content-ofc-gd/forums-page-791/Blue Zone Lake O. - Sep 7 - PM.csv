And only caught 1 (one) Bow. Almost got skunked for the first time this season....one hit = one fish....Oh well, could have been worse....rough ride back got a bit wet too but made it...my wife wasn't feeling well with all the waves pounding us so we called the day 3 hours later. Here is the fish of the day )couldn't get a picture of the only plane of the day;-) ha ha ha    Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
