379852,troutologist,2009-09-04 15:22:00,951,"Chris,  I will agree with you there has not been an in-depth peer reviewed study on this issue. Since this topic has risen here on OFC I have looked into it online and in various journals. There is very little on the topic save a number of allusions and addendums in other C & R studies. Now you seem to be somewhat informed on the process of science and understand various routes of seeking information.  Don't take this as a personal dig, just maybe some explanation as to the lack of rigor in this area of study. Catch and release effects have been studied extensively to various ends. It has, is and will be a ""hot topic"" in biology since there are a multitude of interests at play. Attempts to conserve resources under varying uses. Political lobbying of anti groups and pro sportfishing groups etc. This has/will ensure C & R studies will receive sufficient funding. So there is funding for this type of research, it’s a known issue, why no studies? One major factor is the need for standardized testing and control of certain variables. As you stated there is a difference between good and poor science. Peer review works to catch this.  I spoke to one of Canada's top biologists on C & R physiology regarding this issue. It is difficult to develop a standard protocol and set of circumstances to test the hypothesis of a vertical hold harming the fish. As discussed earlier, this phenomenon is perceived to be have greater deleterious effect on larger/longer fish. Where does one find and house a sufficient number of large fish (e.g. Esox) to have a sample size which permits statistical significance. If angling for these fish, how does one accurately compare the characteristics of the fight, landing, unhooking etc? There are so many variables out of the researcher’s control it makes for a difficult study design. When this occurs there is a lot of qualitative data, estimation and conjecture; flags which will be raised during peer review.  Going back to your points, you elude to a single instance of a large muskie being caught and held vertically. This is precisely the point you are arguing against. It certainly debunks nothing. There are exceptions to every rule and theory. To debunk anything you must have sufficient numbers, drawing a standard curve with one point is challenging.  To finish up, a scientific theory or study the best information available at the time. New information arises, new technology for study, new insights. The perception of today may be different tomorrow. Now, at present there may not be a peer reviewed study expounding the merits of a horizontal hold on fish. There seems to be a lot of agreement that this may be the way to hold a fish to minimize stress. With the information presented to me, I have made a choice to make every effort to 1. Unhook fish in the water with you handling or, 2. hold a fish horizontally with a hand to support its weight.  You or others should not feel obligated to do so, nor should I feel the need to denounce your catch and release techniques. Any attempt to preserve the fishery is admirable. Perhaps as technological capacity increases, a computer simulation will prove all fish should be supported in a net with a mesh size of 75mm at an angle of 11 degrees….I like science."

For real though, the essence of research and science in general is not to prove anything it is to disprove!!!  you either accept or not accept the Null hypothesis.  The Null hypothesis means 'no difference'  between treatments among variable/s in a properly controlled experiment.  So if the Null hypothesis shows to be false, there is something significant happening and that is always a commentary as to what the difference is caused by.  Almost every refereed journal paper ends the same way, 'further research is neccesary in order to vailidate these findings'.  dont even get me started on stastical methods that are used to back it up.  Not sure how to translate all that into DAWG, lol  how you do any of that reagrading this topic is beyond me.  did you see those fish jumping 10' vertical slam into rocks and then jump again though?  lol"

379437,Jet,2009-09-03 14:18:00,364,"I really hate seeing when people bash other about holding fish vertically, especially when they take the time to contribute a report. What better way to say ""Thank You"" especially when they bash someone for holding a fish and not first asking if they kept it. They always seem to assume the worst first. Regardless of who's right, you can educate without bashing.  As GCD and others pointed out, people get bent out of shape about fish held vertically, touching the shore, on grass, but ignore the fact we rip hooks through their mouths, often with great force. Let's not forget about the times it gets stuck in the gullet. The whole sport starts by hurting fish, regardless of whether they feel it or not. Since that part cannot be avoided to enjoy fishing then after that mandatory procedure takes place, we owe it to these fish to be as proactive as possible for the well being of the fish when releasing.  That said, I think if you apply the golden rule of ""Treating others how you want to be treated"" is a good rule of thumb when dealing with fish.  Do you like to breathe? If you do then get the fish back into the water as quickly as possible. Do you like to be held by the neck or foot? Perhaps it doesn't hurt fish as much as some might believe, but I'd sure rather be cradled with two hands.  Some common sense can go a long way."
379494,bubbles,2009-09-03 16:37:00,591,"I prefer to put mine on a metal stringer, let it float behind the boat all day, forget about it a few times and drive away, THEN get to the dock for a photo holding it up by the stringer."
379576,bigfish1965,2009-09-03 21:32:00,3382," How about three years of fish and wildlife studies at Sir Sandford Fleming School of Natural Resources? Plenty of biologists there...plenty of biology and anatomy classes...The mass of the fish is greatly reduced by the buoyancy. They evolved in that conditon for millions of years. The same type of thing happens to us when we travel in weightless environments...certain body structures depend on a specific gravity to function properly. Extended time in space leads to many maladies which is why they use gravity simulation exercise equipment. The opposite is also true. If we were placed in an environment where the g forces were consistently higher than what we evolved in, it would cause significant damage and heart failure. Our heart is strong enough to pump blood in a specific set of conditions. There is no need to have a heart that does more. Consequently higher g forces cause us to black out as blood flow to the brain is reduced. I do not recall the specific g force reduction by water, but it is significant...even more so in salt water. And Dawg..a fish jumping is different because of the momentum of the fish. All of its parts move at the same speed with the forces equal. It's forward acceleration propels it out and up, until gravity brings it back down. Even when gravity is affecting the fish to fall, its organs are falling at the same rate and keep their relative position.  It is more a lesson in physics and anatomy than biology. But common sense also should make most of this obvious."
379579,Raf,2009-09-03 21:41:00,3495,there have been instances where large fish (muskie) have broken their backs while jumping during a fight vs angler. it can happen & many anglers have started keeping their rod tip low to try to prevent the fish from jumping.  lots of things can happen; it is fishn and there will inevitably be some injuries/fatalities but i think the more we can do to educate ourselves and minimize any damage the better.  including supporting large fish horizontally.
379584,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-03 21:51:00,3761,"There's the science and the fighting. End it already, if a dozen more anglers go out and catch a pike or a muskie or a bass and give it a little more support and in the water time then that's a plus in my books.  We can't chance what we have or have not done, all we can do is lookout for the future instead of living in the past. One thing that needs to stop of the removal of fish slime, don't put fish on grass or dirt or whatever, sometimes a wed dock or a wet boat carpet will eliminate slime removal but their only defense to bacteria is there slime.(at least I think)  Let's get all of us to stop posting reports of fish covered in dirt and see more fish being held proudly and clean."

379779,Chris,2009-09-04 12:40:00,405," I typically try to refrain from responding to snide comments from those that have shown themselves in the past to be left-leaning tree-hugger liberal types, but here goes: I checked the gr 11 physics and gr 12 biology books and nowhere did I find any info stating that fish species had large oversized cavernous huge abdominal spaces to house ""loosely"" arranged organs. In fact I saw something that eluded more to fish being structured very tight and streamlined leaving little room for organs to be displaced. It did not mention anything about abdominal spaces at the rear of the fish where displaced organs could move to.  Mr. Salvalinus, there are many scientists and biologists in the world and they all have opinions on things scientific or biological. Many of those opinions differ, some very widely. Take the debate over climate change for a prime example. So their findings need to go thru peer reviews and stuff like that. This is done to prevent speculation from becoming fact. Believe it or not, there is incompetence in every walk of life....there has to be safeguards.  There has never been a peer reviewed study done on the effects of holding a fish vertically. For every anecdotal story claiming this hold has negative effects there is a story about the complete opposite. For example, I have pics of a huge 51lb. muskie taken from a body of water that rarely produces fish even close to that size. It was caught during the hot weather, in shallow water, fought for an extended period of time on bass tackle, held both vertically and horizontally for pics with two different guys holding the fish, meaning the fish endured some extended air time. It had very few teeth left and had distinct markings including a deformed fin. It was succesfully released. Many would argue that fish would be dead in a few hours. However, this very old toothless one-finned wonder-fish was re-caught a year later and although seemingly very healthy when re-caught, it unfortunately died because the suick that the guy caught it on was swallowed with the fish's mouth clamped down. The pictures clearly showed it was the same fish. In fact this particular story suggests that the simple act of fishing in the first place is probably more detrimental to fish populations than how you hold the fish. While this doesn't ""prove"" anything, it certainly debunks claims such as ""A vertically held fish is a dead fish"". That, BTW, is an actual quote from one of the half dozen or so scientists and biologists that are quoted in the 2004 M. Butler ""vertical hold"" article that Marc referred to.  Doc, you forgot to comment on the possible effects of a hand pushing up into the abdominal cavity and bruising organs during a horizontal hold. You also forgot to comment on the effects a fish might feel after being hooked by a lure travelling at 6mph. BTW, I didn't see anything about those things in the school books either.  My suggestion to you and others of your ilk....heed what one of this board's most intelligent and insightful men said.   ""Hold your fish the way you want and let others hold their fish the way they want."""

It is important to think about the landing/release process before hooking a fish.  I read recently that BC has a rule citing all wild steelhead must be released without being removed from the water...not great for photos but better for the fish I suspect.

What about when a fish jumps straight up out of the water 3'-6' high... and then does a belly flop?... and not just once, but several times!!!... Fish LOVE to be vertical!!!  ... they just save it for special occasions!  Then there's another scenario, take a relatively healthy human being and hoist them up by one leg (one of the strongest parts of the body)... more than likely you won't hurt them.  Take that same human being and put them in the water (they're a lot lighter there eh!) and take that same leg and put a rope around it, lets make the rope 200' long... then tie the other end of the rope to a nice Lund, tell the person with the rope around his leg to start swimming in the opposite direction of the  boat as fast as he can (nowhere near as fast as a fish can swim!)... then fire up the Lund and start running at trolling speed (6 mph) What do you think is going to happen when the rope tightens up... I think someone is going to have a hurt leg!!! Maybe a dislocated knee or hip, maybe pulled tendons or broken bones!  Now when a fish swimming at top speed (a helluva lot fast than any human can swim) strikes a lure trolled at 6 mph with his MOUTH how much damage does it do???  Think about it!"
379290,alctel,2009-09-03 00:21:00,26," The fish when it jumps out of water isn't being held upright, so its organs 'go with it' as it jumps and shifts with the rest of the fish. The movement is no way comparable to being held vertically.  Also regarding your 'human being leg' comment, human beings and fish are structured very differently inside!"

I'm talking about the claims that are started with ""OK here's the biology of it"" but have yet to be backed up by science and are presented as undeniable fact, such as the claim that the fishes organs are ""forced down into the rear of the abdominal cavity, stressing the heart and causing serious damage"".  Besides what about a horizontal hold that pushes those same organs up into the middle of the fish. I'm not expecting to see Rick reference any studies because there are none! Period. GCD, don't expect any speculation or responses to your idea that hooking a fish with a 6mph trolled lure can harm the fish because I've made that same arguement before and have never had a response. I guess it's easier for the h-hold proponents to ignore things that don't agree with their position than it is to debate them."

My question is this;  what is the difference between holding a 4lb bass by the lip vertically, or a 4lb walleye vertically, salmon, pike, muskie etc?

Just depends on the fish i guess, with a ski or a pike there body is so long and lean a second hand would be better rather than a bass being short and stout.  Just my opinion, I don't bash fish holding."
378914,Roy,2009-09-01 20:43:00,13728,"I think that holding a bass horizontally by the lower jaw is just as bad. IMO. Because the fish have little or few teeth they feel compelled to hold it by the mouth. The perch might be all of 9"" but they still feel that they must ram their thumb down its throat prior releasing the fish.  I'm guilty of it too. I'll try to be more careful."
378922,Jet,2009-09-01 21:12:00,364,I've watched Italo Labignan hold pike vertically many times on his show and he always indicates he's not holding it by the gill but rather the bone at the top of gill opening closest to the mouth to show he's holding it safely (in his opinion at least).  http://www.in-fisherman.com/content/conser...olding-big-fish

Let's forget all about how we caught that fish, on a huge swimbait with 7/0 trebles trolled at 6 mph!!! Never mention the fact that the fish struck at a right angle to the lure at full speed and when he hit the lure he tried to turn to back to his lair... but the enertia from the 6 mph lure, his speed and body weight sends his eyeballs sailing thru his butthole when was hooked... let's not talk about that!  The 2 strongest parts of a fish are the mouth and the tail!!! The gill plate is part of the mouth! You should be careful of the gill rakes, but they're pretty tough too!  The biggest danger to a fish isn't how you hold it... it's your hook removal skills!!!  I've never seen a fish die from a vertical hold, I've never seen ones jaw break!!!... I have seen many people kill fish with poor hook removal skills!!!  I think the people that whine about the way a fish is held are just jealous because they didn't catch it and want to find something wrong about you catching it!!!"

378947,Leecher,2009-09-02 00:01:00,7832,"This topic surfaces every now and again and imo don't think a vertical or horizontal hold has any fatal impact on any fish that are being caught.   The handling part / time out of the water will determine it's faith.  The more time it takes to return it to it's environment the less chance it has at surviving.  Any fish, big or small will loose a lot of energy fighting to free itself from the hooks that are lodge into it's mouth, so the faster you can get them to the boat the better....  A net will play a crucial role for the handling part.... if you have a livewell, you can use it too.... put it in there and leave the pump running to create oxygen so that it regains it's strength until you release it.  So that being said, for me and this is just my opinion the holding part is no concern.  The quicker you land and release the fish, the better it's survival. Leechman"

378951,hooksetgod,2009-09-02 00:11:00,9,Why does the fish have to be held anyways? Taking a pix in the water does for me. I don't feel I need my mug in the same shot to prove i caught it.
378952,angrypigeon,2009-09-02 00:17:00,31," agree.  i don't think vertical vs horizontal holds drastically change probability for survival.  imo, the worst hold for a fish is holding it on a stringer."
378955,Leecher,2009-09-02 00:24:00,7832, Excactly!!!
378964,Muskieman,2009-09-02 00:47:00,2472,"I believe that a vertical hold from the gill or mouth probably does not harm the fish...... BUT.....I DO Believe that a vertical hold from the tail {upside down} on a large fish can KILL it....Especially a Muskie or Large Pike...THE ONE AND ONLY Muskie that I have on My wall was killed that way...I was a rookie Muskie angler and didn't know. I actually ""felt, heard"" the vertebrae separating..kinda like cracking knuckles.. In no way did I intend to kill this fish , I was lifting it from the ground ""caught from shore"" to cradle it for a safe release..... I spent 30 minutes in the water with her to let her go ... but alas no go...can't swim with a broken back. Although not that big at 49.5 "" 30Lbs...she's a reminder on my wall.   Just my 5 cents.  RFS "
378967,Pigeontroller,2009-09-02 00:59:00,2793,Any fish of larger size sure won't mind a little extra support.

378977,Guest skeeter99,2009-09-02 02:03:00,0,  what's the difference you ask?  one hold will get 2 replies  the other will start a war and lock the thread  LOL!!!
378982,hooksetgod,2009-09-02 02:08:00,9,"I'm currently working on a water filled table which to hold the fish in a perfect ""living state"" therefore allowing everyone on the lake to have their picture taken with the fish.lol"
378984,JPD,2009-09-02 02:15:00,296,"Hey Roy,  What if his hand is really small and the Perch is really big... "
378985,craigdritchie,2009-09-02 02:15:00,1586,"In-Fisherman had an article a couple of years ago on this. They concluded that holding a bass vertically by the lower lip generally doesn't hurt the fish. Different story if you crank the jaw downwards, so its mouth gapes wide open. Then, the fish's full weight goes on a couple of small tendons, causing permanent damage. At best, the damage makes it more difficult for the bass to feed. At worst, the fish cannot feed properly at all, and dies a slow death from gradual starvation.    You see guys show off their fish like this at tournaments all the time, and it always makes me cringe. The research cited in the In-Fisherman article said up to 50 percent of these fish croak a couple of weeks after the tournament. They suggest that the heavier the fish, the more likely anglers are to cause permanent damage this way.  Totally agree with previous posters .... there's generally no reason to handle the fish any more than absolutely necessary."
379022,Greencoachdog,2009-09-02 04:05:00,8163,"  ... and that's why all the TV star fishermen feel like they have to hold the Bass by the lower lip and rotate it horizontal???... watch the TV fishing show ""Gods"" and see what they do!!!  Like I stated before, the 2 toughest parts of any fish are the mouth and the tail... with the mouth being the tougher of the 2!!!... the tail propels the mouth!  Surely the TV fishing show gods wouldn't harm a fish!!!  Hook removal time and time out of the water are the 2 most crucial factors in C&R survival!!!... if you can't remove a hook properly, you should practice on Bluegills and Perch until you can!!!  If you want to hold a fish up and    for the camera, revive it in the livewell first!!!"
379056,anders,2009-09-02 12:57:00,1168,"thanks for the replies guys!  I would have to agree...if your not keeping it, the less time out of the water the better, but your right GCD (cringe)...hook removel is essential for survival."
379072,BillM,2009-09-02 14:22:00,17367,I vertical hold bass and small pike.  Anything with a decent amount of weight gets supported underneath the belly.
379083,anders,2009-09-02 14:44:00,1168, Thats the question though Bill....whats the difference?  The weight on there little bodies is the same as a big fish...proportion wise!
379106,bigfish1965,2009-09-02 15:31:00,3382,"Okay here's the biology of it all...   When a fish is in water,t hey weigh considerably less than when out of water due to buoyancy. The internal organs are all lined up in a specific way and are relatively loose inside the body cavity. This allows them to move around quickly and bend laterally. But the organs are designed to always be in that position...horizontal. When you remove the fish from the water, there is no bouyancy and the weight increases dramatically. Holding fish, especially larger fish, vertically causes the internal organs to be forced down into the rear of the abdominal cavity, stresses the heart and can cause serious damage. Horizontal holds keep the organs in relatively the same position. Yes, picking a very large fish up by the tail can cause significant spinal injury. Put the fish back into the net if you cannot get a decent hold of it then place it back into the water.  The ideal landing to release for a very large fish should be something like the following...  Fight fish to net or cradle. Leave fish in the net or cradle in the water for a minute or so before pulling it out of the water....this allows them to collect some oxygen before being taken out. Cut/remove hooks while in the net/cradle if it is safe to do so. Prepare camera. Wearing protective gloves (filet gloves work well) slide one hand under the gill plate up to the front closest to the mouth being sure not to get a gill raker .. those things will chew your hand up and hurt the fish..lift the fish up and toward you while sliding your free hand under the fish. You should now have the fish horizontal and for very large fish you can place it on your lap or use your forearm for additional belly support. Get your pics quick. Place the fish back in the water as close to horizontal as u can holding with both hands. Release your hold on the front of the fish and hold the tail until the fish struggles free of your grip."
