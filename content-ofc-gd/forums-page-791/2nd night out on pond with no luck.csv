I didn't get even a atempt. i was tossing a texas rigged yum buzz frog then tried a buzz bait and spinners then a hula popper then on to some stuff that is under surface and no luck  the pond was like glass  saw few jumpers  but nothing  there was some other guys out there and they had no luck either   next chance i might have to go out will be sat morn   and looking for ideas on things to try
379387,splashhopper,2009-09-03 11:30:00,2931,"stay one more hour.... at night  I don't get to the place I fish until 6:30pm , or about 90 minutes before dusk.... and I leave about 30 minutes after it gets dark on the local ponds..  When salmon and trout season are in full force, I will fish till midnight at least...  Keep up the efforts... you WILL be rewarded soon"
379389,Greencoachdog,2009-09-03 11:35:00,8163,"Skinny!... you're a Jonah!... a Jinx!... an Albatross around the neck of fishing!!!  Try live bait next time, worms or minnows."
379419,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-03 13:42:00,3761,"It wasn't luck that makes the fish bite it's using the right bait at the right times. Sometimes just throwing out any old lure will work. Go back and stay earlier or IMO a morning bite can work wonders. Gives the fish all night to cruise around in the silence, get out there at 5am then throw some topwaters around...*cough* Skitter Pop.  MTBF"
379429,Leecher,2009-09-03 13:57:00,7832,"Don't know how deep the pond is but if you have a depth finder, try and locate underwater humps and work the drop offs with crankbaits.  My preferred one is a white BigO.  You can also work senkos around stumps and weed lines or like GCD said ""live bait"" Good luck to you!!! Leechman"
379431,spinnerbaitking,2009-09-03 13:59:00,1622,"I had a buddy that couldn't catch much & I always teased him that he stunk, after bugging him enough about using sent he finally started to use mine and ended up catching alot more fish, some people do have an oil that could turn fish off, worth a try, Mega Strike Richard"
379764,Greencoachdog,2009-09-04 10:59:00,8163,"Here's another tip for you Skinny.  It sounds like you pond may have a fair amount of fishing pressure, and if so... you may want to downsize your offerings, small inline spinners on ultra light tackle work for me under those conditions. You may also want to consider using small tubes and jigs as well. A Beetle Spin may work wonders!"

380323,[email protected],2009-09-06 15:58:00,290," Coming from Brantford, 403 to Rest Acres Rd I think it is, Which I believe is 24 south?..  Then turning left onto Thompson.  I know theres other ponds but I don't know how to get to them"
380327,skinny,2009-09-06 16:10:00,442,ok on 24 south turn left just before the overpass (thompson r is left after the overpass after turning left just drive you will find the ponds i usally fish the last one to north if you pull into the little parking area by boat launch and there is green ford truck((super cab) parked i'm prob out there
380418,[email protected],2009-09-07 02:50:00,290," I think me and the GF will be going out there tomorrow to do some shore fishing.  I'm sick of fishing at Wilkes with 300 other people right beside me constantly casting over my line.  Although it was interesting yesterday, I threw out my line with a worm on it, and it started tugging so i set the hook. I reeled it in, and on the end of the line i hooked a big clump of weeds, and then running through that horizontally was someone elses line (that they cut and left it out there, who knows how long ago), and it had a big sucker on it. So I caught a fish that wasnt even on my hook lol."
380558,[email protected],2009-09-07 21:50:00,290,"Just got back from Waterford Ponds.  We were on the road on Mechanic St fishing the south pond.  We fished for 4 hours and caught 2 sunfish.  Whatever was eating our worms was doing it in 1 hit, it was getting very frustrating. The stupid piece of crap rod that I was using for live bait sucks at setting the hook, and I got mad and slammed it into the ground. No more rod. lol... Guess you get what you pay for.  The guy right next to us caught a nice 2-3lb smallmouth though..."
