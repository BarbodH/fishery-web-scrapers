378603,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-31 23:02:00,3761,"  lol, i was saying it was 6 14 in the video because it was...but the photo that came out was the bass with the 6 13...i figure the lure was close to a ounce and hey it will be easier to beat then a 6 13.5lb largie. The scale was jumping so I choose the lowest # I saw and yes there was a foot of line and that 2"" Skitter pop  As for the sign...umm ya about that...the fish was needing air and i had to release it. yes it would be a extra 2 pts for our team but as i told the captian i wanted the fish released as quickly as i could.  btw-im still waiting from ontario angler awards for the 21"" largie I caught so we can at least get those 2 bonus inches.  We need a musky and some trout dude!! Do u fish for either species?"

378708,JPD,2009-09-01 02:43:00,296,"Congrats Mike on a fish of a lifetime!!! Well done on the video and the release as well. You'll remember her for the rest of your life and smile every time you think about the fight!  Fish like that have a way of embedding several things in your brain... how warm the water felt that day, the smell in the air that morning, the temp and even the sound of the strike... enjoy it bud, you deserve it! Keep at it and eventually you'll get your 7.  JP"
378715,ciceri,2009-09-01 02:56:00,535," Nervous? There's alot of college girls around town now, should give you something to do this weekend haha. I'm not around on weekends, but the best fishing is in the evenings though. We were out there tonight, 5-9, i landed 2 dink smallies and my bud got a sized rockbass, lol. Lot's of fish missed as usual. Hopefully the musky will start hitting soon."
378754,rbaquial,2009-09-01 12:16:00,968,Whoaaaaaaaaaaaa BRO!!! That's FREAKIN' HUUUUUGE!!  Nicely done!
378765,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-09-01 12:35:00,0,WOW! Nice lunker bass! Great video too! You fought it like a pro. Congrats on your personal best.
379006,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-02 03:25:00,3761," I might have to take you up on that offer next season. Maybe some smallie action with tubes?  Thanks JP! All I remember is how cold that morning was until I hooked into that giant. My heart racing and the constant smile and the ability not to fish after I brought that  biggin in. Too much excitement for a young angler. I'll keep my eye's open for the date of one of your BPS seminars during the spring classic and get to meet you in person.   Not sure about the other's but in my books that's my bass of the year! But hey, the year is now over yet!   Thanks dude! I have this popper fishing down flat. I twitch it as if it were real lol. Too bad I didn't get the camera on sooner then you could of seen the up's and downs of the rod in my hand while I was keeping the fish from leaping into the air lol."
379017,Victor,2009-09-02 03:55:00,1609,"Congrats Mike!  That ""6"" we don't see too often here!!!! I was pretty excited when i saw the pic too! Congrats once again!"

380912,NAC,2009-09-08 20:21:00,369,very nice hawg largie you caught there Mike and excellent recount of the event.  Video and pictures tell it all without even having to add the commentary.
378242,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-31 00:03:00,3761,"  That's ok, I think ur PB smallie was 7lb's in change. My PB smallie is 4 in change...guess were even...for now"
378245,Leecher,2009-08-31 00:07:00,7832,"WOW Mike.... UNREAL....  first of, I'd like to say congratulations on landing that hawg from shore    That is the biggest largie I've ever seen and certainly a fish of a life time!!!  Watching the videos and seeing you pat yourself on the chest and say ""MY HEART..."" brought back some flash backs and know exactly how you felt Such sweat reward for your efforts and speaking of mention..... here is your quote and mine from my last report   I just didn't know it would be that soon LOL Again EXCELLENT job and hope you get a replica cause this is truly a fish of a life time Keep up the good work and thanks for sharing! Jacques aka Leechman"
378250,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-31 00:11:00,3761," Thanks for the comments man. Once time is free and I got a vehicle, well go and do some bass fishing together...I might be wrong but we may have the the top 2 spots for bass on this forum so far this year.(May of not seen all big bass)  For that we should be grateful!  Cheers and good luck out there, you never what will smash your lure next!  MTBF"
378266,CLofchik,2009-08-31 00:32:00,854,"Nice sunfish  Oddly enough all of my trophy sunfish have come from topwaters or twitch baits.  Never really thought about it until you mentioned it in your video but I never thought of topwaters as hawg lures, even though they've caught all of my 5lb+, huh."
378288,Garry2Rs,2009-08-31 01:07:00,1425,Great fish Mike Congratulations!
378315,ehg,2009-08-31 02:00:00,2666,Congrats on that HUGE largemouth  Nice work on getting the video and release. There are some big bass in that system. Remember a few years ago someone posted an easy 8lb+ fish from the Otonabee River which is in the same level of flow. Keep at it and there could be bigger ones.
378331,fishnsled,2009-08-31 02:38:00,3520,"EPIC I'd say!  I've only seen one bigger in my life at 7.25 pounds  it was released as well.  Very nicely done MTBF!  The catching, videos, pics and releasing will make for some great memories."
378341,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-31 03:03:00,3761," Thanks for the comments, and I believe it, they had a bass mounted in the office that was 8.3lbs caught out of that lake.  Unreal water and there are some big smallmouth out there that love to jump around in the weed beds(or so we see). Previous to my fish a bass was brought in at 6lbs 10 ounces...so I'm in the lead but big fish are there, it's up to us to be responsible and release those bigger than a pound or two."
378345,ciceri,2009-08-31 03:26:00,535,"That's exciting, congrats Mike."
378370,mattyk,2009-08-31 09:57:00,2110,great hawg! Thats a fish of a lifetime. I have been fishing for a long time and have never caught a largemounth that big! Great job on the release!

378408,kennyman,2009-08-31 13:07:00,737,That fish was GIGANDOUS !!!!! And you got it on topwater to boot.   That would be awesome. It's going to be a tough fish to beat. I think you'll have to head to Okeechobee to top that one. Thanks for sharing.

378535,Harrison,2009-08-31 19:53:00,2202,"awesome fish bud, especially from shore.... rarity for sure.  Seymour is a wicked big fish part of the trent system, IF you can find them.  Kudos, and from shore!  Mint."
378540,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-31 20:01:00,3761,"  Thank's man. I had to see it for myself to beleive it. Unreal, it's not normal or possible to catch them that big everyday. You keep going at it pal and you will get your biggin or ur nickle if i still have yet to achieve that. But man, you have had a very succesful season so far. I don't any of us have caught so many 4lb+ bass this year lol.   Lol, ya I had the lure in it's jaw. I waited until the release vid to take it out just in case she shook in between the in and out's from the water during photos.   Thanks man, I'm headin up to Lindsay this Saturday so the following weekend or so we need to meet up and do some bass fishing in the river!   Are you serious? Nobody has a bigger largie  Hmm, hopefully somebody can get something bigger!    And a huge thanks goes out to all the other members that have and will be leaving comments. A few years back if I would of caught this bass only family would be able to see it and well for us fishermen praise and appreciation brings a smile to any anglers face after a great catch!  Thanks and this is not the end for Mike The Bass Fisher"
378595,pro190,2009-08-31 22:41:00,13,That was one INCREDIBLE bass!  Congrats!
378596,richyb,2009-08-31 22:43:00,774,"*COUGH COUGH* dont forget to minus the 1/2 oz for the lure in its mouth while weighing haha, j/k sweet fish man , nice upgrade for our team also. I hope you had the sign ?"
378136,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-30 20:03:00,3761,"Well, this weekend was a blast. Most importantly I caught my new PB Largemouth Bass and boy was this fish a HOG! Here's the story, We drove up there late Thursday night(Lake Seymour) and set up the trailer got some rods ready and went to bed.  I set my alarm for 5:15am the next morning and it was perfect out, flat water, no breeze and not a sole out on the lake. My favorite and most productive topwater bait is a skitter pop(2""). So I fished off the main dock in the cold for a good 20-30 minutes and without a single strike. So I'm thinking O great those OFC guys are going to be right..SKUNK!  Well, I was fed up so I walked across the shore to the next dock and casted out to a old retired dock that had a old broken up crib off to the side of it. On the first cast right after I set up the camera I threw the popper in and BAM! This huge bass came and swung at my bait like a train, waited a second and set the hook. With a lighter action rod and 12lb mono I was scared to death that I was going to loose it, so handling the biggest fish of my life I go 1 handed with the rod just to set up the camera and to get some of it on video lol. Let's not forget I'm 6' tall and 200lbs...the pic of me standing makes the fish look perfect in perspective.  As heard on camera I thought i had a 5lb bass on so finally a nickle but nope she was bigger. Fight video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmt6O4RfJTw  Ok but as you could see in the release video she was fine and strong after a few pictures and back and forth in the water.  Picture 1 and 2, man was I excited and stunned at the girth and weight of this monster that was caught from shore. 6lbs 13 ounces  Again  Shot with the scale 6lbs 13 ounces   Can I say it again? 6lbs 13ounces  More  1More    And as always a animal pic and a sky picture!     All and all this was the best and most exciting catch of my life and well it will be a hard fish to beat. Now that I have suppressed the nickle and a penny mark I'm on hunting for the 7lb bass!    :D  :D MTBF    Definitely looking into a replica mount"
378139,Syn,2009-08-30 20:07:00,519,Holy Cow that's a huge bass. Congrats!!!

You would not want to see the slime my camera had on it due to me with the fish in and out between the 5second timer lol  was fun and a rush!  Thanks for all for comments, will check back later!
