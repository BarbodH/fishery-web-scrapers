380737,Twocoda,2009-09-08 03:52:00,4130,salmon should be in there now ...after the next rain it should be pretty productive.....do your homework on a float set up and go get em ...worms roe or flys ( pick your preference).....check your regulations and have some fun ....good luck landing the fresh ones   welcome to the board
