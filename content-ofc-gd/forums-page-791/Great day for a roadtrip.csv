Today's travels took us to the town of Elora on the banks of the Grand.  A quaint town with it's own rustic charm and sights to see.  Lots of shops for the women. I fished for smallies from the parking lot for part of the morning.  As you cross the main bridge ther are floating sculptures in the  river, made right in town.   The Mill dominates the town and the falls behind it are worth the trip even if they have been photographed a thousand times.   A mile down the road is the Elora Gorge CA with a nice hiking trail to spend an afternoon on.      I even found a snug little bear cave to have a wee nap in.   The best part of the adventure is having the family together for today's outing. Judy is home to stay and, hopefully, Anna will be home to stay soon as she completes her treatments. "
