380449,singingdog,2009-09-07 12:20:00,1047,I will be in Morrisburg this weekend. I am taking the yak and would love to get on the water early mornings. If anyone could point me toward decent launch spots I would appreciate it. I was thinking the St. Lawrence for smallies. Should I bring pike/musky gear?
