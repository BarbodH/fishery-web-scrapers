I guess it must be difficult to gauge the success or lack of without folks answering too much but as far as I'm concerned it's a goldmine of important news tailored to our passion for the outdoors.  Thank you sir!  ps. Kickingfrog (Rob) has been contributing too!

380317,Radnine,2009-09-06 15:17:00,1538,"There are many wonderful things on this great forum that the average user (me) isn't even aware of. I like the ""Get North!"" section for day dreaming and looking up article in the old e-zines. I am not sure of how the management structure works here on the board, but everyone deserves a pat on the back for the way that it runs. Jim"

380598,kickingfrog,2009-09-07 23:30:00,8333,"Ah shucks... I just post stuff to start fights. Spiel's the serious one   Seriously though, OFC is a great resource to funnel information. I also feel that the media does not always give some of these issues the coverage we think they deserve."
