380096,CLofchik,2009-09-05 04:44:00,854,"Wow that's a HAWG, there's been a few real pigs caught off Bronte lately.  They lose a chunk of their weight when they get dark but that's still North of 30.  Were you the last boat out there, heh now I know why you didn't want to come in  Oh if the last boat out there was you pick up a stern light before you get dinged."
380098,steelhead hunter,2009-09-05 04:50:00,152,we got off the lake around 9ish and there were still  boats out there when we came in had to get the old man home he tore some thing in his arm releaseing his fish sucks to get old
380101,bigfish1965,2009-09-05 07:25:00,3382,"Wow... I have not seen a 42"" salmon in a long time. In the salmon glory days if the 80's we saw them up to 45"". I found then that the fish were basically a pound an inch when they were over 35""."
380115,Cudz,2009-09-05 11:36:00,2652,"That is big.  Wow.  I am a bit confused from your post. THe fish actually weighed 45 pounds but yout thought it was only 30 or 35? Either way, that is a huge great lakes fish.  congrats With your weight guessing skill it might be safe to say that your dad's fish wasn't 25 pounds, it probably weighed 35"
380118,Twocoda,2009-09-05 11:51:00,4130,Nice fish ...its about this time of year the record fish are caught ....this one may be late for the derby but if you keep plaggin away at it ....you could possibly break the record fish
380168,steelhead hunter,2009-09-05 15:00:00,152,when we were on the lake we figured it was around 30 35 we have never seen a salmon that big before we never would have thought 45  thanks for the congrats from everyone
380199,danbo,2009-09-05 19:45:00,2646,A Thrill fight for sure!
380222,fishinguypat,2009-09-05 22:40:00,547,trolling or what?
380228,steelhead hunter,2009-09-05 23:36:00,152,yes we were tolling 30' over 100'
380264,jediangler,2009-09-06 03:11:00,1923,"Congrats on the nice fish man. I caught a 42"" X 24"" from the pier at Bronte years ago that weighed right on 30lbs."
380379,chinookhunter,2009-09-07 00:05:00,68,too bad you didnt have a scale . no one will ever no if it was 30 or 50 lbs for sure.
380384,steelhead hunter,2009-09-07 00:23:00,152,I could care less what people think it weighed it as calculated out at 45.38lbs just because I didn't have a scale means nothing
380488,Who Da Man,2009-09-07 15:18:00,21,"Nice size fish.  Have'nt seen any that long in a while.  I remember about 14yrs ago getting a 42"" out of a northern trib.  Now your lucky if they are 24"" if anything at all.  Ah, I must be getting old cause I'm starting to sound like those old timers that tell stories about the good old days!"
380613,Sinker,2009-09-07 23:47:00,8692,"I got one 40 x 27 that was 30lbs on the money. Yours doesn't look as thick, but its prolly just the picture. Its a good 30lber for sure.............nowhere near 45 though.  "
380740,CLofchik,2009-09-08 04:02:00,854," When they get dark with the fully developed kype it's been 3+ weeks since they've eaten last, bucks will thin out and lose over 1/4 of their weight before they spawn.  Saw a 44"" fish up the river last year that wasn't even 25lbs.  SHunter is probably safe if he calls it a 35, but if he wants to stretch it to 45 it's a good thing he doesn't bring a scale"
380771,anders,2009-09-08 13:11:00,1168,What a tank!! Congrats...i got 4.5 lbs last night!
380856,corvette1,2009-09-08 18:30:00,1765,awesome fish congrats
380915,steelhead hunter,2009-09-08 20:25:00,152,I don't know were you get the idea that the fish hasn't eaten in 3+ weeks we were like 2 miles out in the lake and it was caught in the middle of a huge school of bait but what ever makes you feel better
380935,CLofchik,2009-09-08 21:45:00,854," It's basic salmon anatomy, as drastic as the spawning changes are on the outside, there are just as drastic changes going on inside.  Pacific salmon are incapable of digesting food long before they get dark, doesn't matter if they are up river or still in the lake waiting to run."
380941,Sinker,2009-09-08 21:51:00,8692,"regardless, its still not 45lbs. A good fish for sure, but nowhere near 45lbs.  S."
380952,steelhead hunter,2009-09-08 23:14:00,152,well just got done talking to advanced taxedermy about getting a mount done and even they say it is over 40 before I even said anything about the weight but what do they know
