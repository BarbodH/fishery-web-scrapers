However, my canoe is at home in the GTA and I'm without a car. I would likely be going only as far as the intersection of Hwy 69 and the river itself.  Does anyone know of any services that cater to this sort of need? My canoe is a 16fter."

380824,Raf,2009-09-08 17:17:00,3495,how do you intend to get up there?  there's an outfitter on hwy 69 just south of the french r. bridge that may shuttle you and your canoe but you'd have to rent from them.   i don't remember their name off the top of my head but they're at the cutoff to grundy lake PP.
