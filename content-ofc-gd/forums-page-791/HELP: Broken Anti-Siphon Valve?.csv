From what I have been reading, I believe this is the anti-siphon valve (?).  I may be completely wrong about that though.  Fuel was allowed to leak out of the end of the line (there was nothing stopping it).  Is there a repair for this or will I need to replace the fuel line (it is a mid 80's Merc with the old connector)?  And can I live without it and still run my motor until I get it fixed (a few days)?  My Grandpa is coming to visit/fish tomorrow, so responses asap would be great!  I really hope I can still go out on it without these pieces/valve.  Thanks!!!"

Cut off the old connector, insert the new one and tighten the hose clamp and yer done!! Take the broken connector into a Napa store or marina and they should have a replacement."
