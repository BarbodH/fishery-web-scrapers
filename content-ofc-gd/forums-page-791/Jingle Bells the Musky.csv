380804,Muskieman,2009-09-08 15:35:00,2472,"It's the LEGEND of a Muskie so large and has snapped off so many lines ...It still has all the lures in Her mouth ...that when she swims  It sounds like "" Jingling Bells""   RFS "

Apparently, whenever it jumped out of the lake, it would jingle and had all these spoons in his mouth, no one could reel him in - not sure if he was ever caught. Minnesota I believe. Anyone else have experience with a Fish that kept getting away!"
380841,LucG,2009-09-08 18:06:00,779," I once hooked onto a monster smallmouth with a topwater jointed jitter bug on some tiny lake back in boulter. Short story, it broke my line and all day long that thing was jumping out of the water trying to shake that lure out of his mouth. About 3 hours later, no word of a lie, I saw my jitter bug floating at the surface of the water. I was happy to get that lure back, but prob. lost a PB."
