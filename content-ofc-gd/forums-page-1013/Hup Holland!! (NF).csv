215275,Terry,2008-06-13 20:47:00,14456,"I didn't know they were at war.... France must have wanted their pot, women and dikes........oh wait...same thing"
215276,timmeh,2008-06-13 20:48:00,609,It was a great game. The Oranje look pretty unstoppable right now. 7 goals vs italy and france!
215278,Mike01,2008-06-13 20:56:00,378,"great game....I wanted to name both my sons Arjen, after Arjen Robben.  The girlfriend is Dutch, but didn't want her son named after a soccer player!!"
215280,Spiel,2008-06-13 20:59:00,9065,"....Thanks Gerritt, you can't begin to imagine how the knowledge of this has already begun to improve my life."
215281,Gerritt,2008-06-13 21:00:00,6129,I am glad to be able to expand you're horizons Chris LOL!  G
215283,limeyangler,2008-06-13 21:08:00,5204,"The dutch look awesome at the moment, i have always rated Van Persie, even though he plays for Arsenal...guess someone has to. Can you imagine a team with Van Persie and Ronaldo playing up front...wow."
215284,misfish,2008-06-13 21:10:00,29133,Yer Drunk arent ya G? LOL
215288,Gerritt,2008-06-13 21:15:00,6129,"Arsenal.... we all know United has Arsenal by the bullocks!  My wife is not happy that England is not present this year.... she is sobbing in her tea, while I cheer with a beer   Arsenal.... Pfft!  G"
215289,Gerritt,2008-06-13 21:16:00,6129,   Naw... watched the game and packed up the truck.. Off to Nipissing in the morning!  G
215290,tbayboy,2008-06-13 21:20:00,1497,Time to jump on the old heritage bandwagon I think!  Considering our fishing gang is all dutch and italians (and one asian - not sure how he snuck in  ) should make for some good ribbing
215292,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-13 21:31:00,0,Lets hope they beat Romania!!!  I cant believe any team could ever score more than 3 goals on France. They are a very disciplined team.......But a female friend of mine predicted that Holland would score 3 or 4 goals against France.
215296,JohnF,2008-06-13 21:57:00,3494," Yeah, but can these guys even skate?????  JF"
215302,Greencoachdog,2008-06-13 22:07:00,8163,"""There's 2 things I hate in this world... people that hate people, and the Dutch!""... Nigel Powers"
215303,misfish,2008-06-13 22:07:00,29133, Safe trip bud.

215383,Andy,2008-06-14 01:45:00,330,"""The dutch look awesome at the moment""   And this is news to some people?? It's more like what else is new...Gerritt, as a fisherman and fellow Dutchman, I am happily jumping on your heritage bandwagon. Andy"
215391,Gerritt,2008-06-14 02:15:00,6129,"Thank you Andy, both my parents are right off the ""boat"" so to speak.... but  I am torn.. I am Dutch and Portuguese.. My father is Dutch.. my mother is Portuguese... but my mother is adopted.. So I do not know that side of my heritage..  I have been pretty much raised as a Dutch kid...  Wooden head, Wooden shoes... wooden footprints against their skulls!  G"
215395,HTHM,2008-06-14 02:37:00,4082,"no, it is wooden head, wooden shoes, wooden listen. I think this might be Hollands year! Let's not forget that we have a tendancy to fall apart at the seams, but still to beat both world cup finalists, is something special."
215772,jjcanoe,2008-06-15 20:01:00,744,"Being married to a Dutch woman has taucht me a few things, don't ask how I know all this....   a 'pot' in Holland is slang for a lesbian, a 'dike' is also a lesbian and a woman can be a lesbian!  oh yeah,  !Hup Holland Hup!  jjcanoe"
215792,HTHM,2008-06-15 21:01:00,4082,"Look up the olympic records for speed skating. There used to be a race called the Elfestendentoch (sp) wich roughly translated is, ""The eleven city tour"". Now with the climate change it is not held as often, as it is an outdoor race on the canals. So ya they can skate."
