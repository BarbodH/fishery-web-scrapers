I think the rainbows like temps in the 50-60 degree range and am not sure about the walleyes???  We don't have a temp guage for the bottom of the lake, nor the $500.00 it costs to get one just now. (We just have our depth finder with the surface temps on it.)  Could i attach a thermometor to the cannon ball and then bring it back up 5-10 minutes later for a reading until i can afford something better?  Thanks splashhopper and botbot"

215943,HTHM,2008-06-16 02:43:00,4082,"As CCMT says it will be going through different temps, but it should only make a difference of a few degrees at worst. I say give 'er a shot."
215959,jace,2008-06-16 03:38:00,472,some stand alone temparature probes are under $20 and the add-on probes for fish finders are generally $75 and less if you have one that has inputs for one.

You drop the device to the bottom, raise a few inches, shake it around to get the air out and let water in, and let it sit for about a minute.  You then reel it up as quick as possible.  Inside the glass case there are two measures: one for temperature and one for depth.  You will know now the water tempt at the indicated depth."
