My buddies and I are heading to the lake of the woods area next weekend (June 19th-22n, 2008) fishing off of Rice lake. It's a Tournament and i'm just looking for a leg up on my competition. We troll the coast lines, usually in about 12-25 feet deep water and I was just wondering if anyone had any ideas of lures or techniques on ho0w to bag loads of fish. The bigger the better. I primarily use crawler harnesses or Mepps agalia longs#3 or #4. Again any input on where they hide or how to get some strikes. We hit the water at about 6am and fish till about 9 at night. Well heres hoping I get some hits, no pun intended. Thanks to everyone who posts any comment and happy fishing all.   Sincerly CS"

Otherwise keep trolling over likely looking structure and switch up on the colors. Try locating clouds of baitfish, and work those also."
