Senior Metrolinx official, John Howe, says well over $2.8-billion  dollars a year for the next 25 years will be required to dramatically  expand  public transit.  The angency has come up with a list of new ways to pay for huge  investments in public transit being considered to fight traffic jams  and greenhouse gas emissions in the greater Toronto and Hamilton  regions.  Implementing any one of the following ideas could generate as much as $1 billion a year:  - charging 10 cent per kilometre or more to drive along the DVP, Gardiner and 400 series highways  - a gas tax increase of 20 cents per litre or more  - a $1 weekday charge on every non-residential parking spot  A draft plan of the financing options and a draft of Metrolinxs  proposed public transit improvements are due by July 25.  The final  list of options will be presented to Queen's Park in the fall.  Plans must be approved by the Metrolinx's board, which includes  Toronto Mayor David Miller, Mississauga Mayor Hazel McCallion and  Chairs of York, Halton and Durham regions."
