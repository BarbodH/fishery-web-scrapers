215606,forrest,2008-06-15 01:20:00,1032,Stickers or paint?  Once a boat has a license number on it is it ever removed?  I heard it is bad luck.  whats the best way to go paint/stencil or a premade sticker? Like car pin striping are there guys that do numbers?  forrest

215644,wallyboss,2008-06-15 03:30:00,1095,Depends on the boat. my old tinny was stencil and a can of white spray paint. Not pretty but it's legal.  New boat nice vinyl stickers.
