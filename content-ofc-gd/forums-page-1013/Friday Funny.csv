The blonde cop asked to see the blonde driver's license. The driver dug through her purse and was getting progressively more agitated. 'What does it look like?' she finally asked.  The policewoman replied, 'It's square and it has your picture on it.'  The driver finally found a square mirror in her purse, looked at it and handed it to the policewoman. 'Here it is,' she said.  The blonde officer looked at the mirror, then handed it back saying, 'Okay, you can go. I didn't realize you were a cop.""  Meely  Have a great weekend......"

I was in a great mood ... and then ... I rear-ended a car.   So there we are alongside the road and slowly the driver gets out of the car ... and you know how you just get sooo stressed and life stuff seems to get funny?  Yeah, well, I could NOT believe it .. he was a DWARF!  He storms over to my car, looks up at me and says,  'I AM NOT HAPPY!'  So, I look down at him and said, 'Well, which one are you then?'  ............ and that's when the fight started."
