I do most of my fishing at Lake Scugog and have had my boat docked there the last six seasons. Fishing seems to be good this year. I was out last Wed night and nailed a musky, 3 walleye pickeral  and the usually rockbass/perch. Here is a pic...    Also was up there last night...nailed another 5 walleye pickeral!! and 1 largie.  Cheers"
