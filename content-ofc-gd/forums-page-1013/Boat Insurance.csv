215366,danbouck,2008-06-14 01:02:00,4380,I got Northstar Insurance for my new boat and it runs about $400 per year
215367,Gerritt,2008-06-14 01:02:00,6129,Call the company that insures you're home....  G
215417,POLLIWOGG,2008-06-14 04:01:00,835,"If you put the boat on your house ins. will a claim on the boat drive up your house ins. or maybe they will drop you?  I don't know, I don't insure the boat."
215450,JorgeCarlos,2008-06-14 12:08:00,109,is the law to have insurance in the boat or just up to the owner??
215498,danbouck,2008-06-14 15:54:00,4380, It is not the law YET!
215530,workwear,2008-06-14 19:55:00,592,it is not the law as of yet...but my thinking is ..if it is an expensive boat wh  not insure it.....also if you ever entertain on the boat ....tubing or takin friends out ....i think it would be best to do so ......i currently pay bout 600 a year and its on its own policy...i would have to claim it on my house and then have a claim and be rejected the year after on my house.....but on smaller vessels its possible.....do your homewrok....and find the best price  other than that .....its piece of mind...... i hope never to run over a log or some rocks....but i do know that im coverd if i do ......    cheers  peter

215616,Landlocked,2008-06-15 02:06:00,171,"Depends on the value, you can add it to your homeowners but preferably it is much better to insure with a marine specialty company.  That being said, find a local broker who deals with Cowan Insurance. If you're not worried about damage to the boat you can likely extend liability coverage from your homeowners fairly economically."
