Its so much fun seeing all the animals (i think i got a kick out of it more then my 2 year old)  Here are some pictures from the day!  My wife and son    The rhino, one of my favorites of the day for sure!    And a video fo the Rhino up close.  What a beast!   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaOUCDkW77s   Got to love the big a-- lion laying in the sun     For those of you that have never been to the zoo, if you do the canadian area, be prepared that you see all these animals, bears, moose cougars (the ones at the bars) in real life when your fishing!  The hill you have to walk up is a killer and with a 2 year old in a stroller and a hundred pounds of gear its pretty tough!  THat being said to see a grizzly 10 feet away that isnt trying to eat you is worth it!    My son and I having a rest before we attempt to go up the huge hill that seems to never end lol    I got to admit getting this close to a tiger is pretty cool stuff!    Behind the Waterfall    Looking at the Waterfall    Well that is all!  It was a great day!  It was packs with a whole bunch of knee high animals, some were cute some should have been in cages themsleves and some were great and there parents should have been in cages lol  The sun stayed away until we got in the car which was perfect!  Cheers!"
