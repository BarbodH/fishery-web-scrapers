You have no fear, because you are intimate with fear.  Don't listen to Snag, he goes to work with salmon juice on his pants, plus he eats harbour pike.  He's a very small, spiteful old jigga.  yyyeeee booyeee!  Welcome to my domain.  H to the D"

215291,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-13 21:24:00,0,Very Impressive. It looks like 1 pike is about 38 inches and the rest are over 40! Were they caught trolling or casting?
