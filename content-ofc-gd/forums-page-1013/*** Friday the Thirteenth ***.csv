215117,Clampet,2008-06-13 14:06:00,1947,"Well I don't consider myself to be the superstitious type, but this is how my day went..  Discover this morning, I am out of white shirts to wear with my suit to go on a 9:00 interview.  Call the interviewer, and figure, honesty the best policy, and request we re-schedule fer next Monday.  He says, ""Don't worry about it, come in today anyway"".  So I wore dress pants and a short sleeved colared shirt. I drive there, I'm about 3 minutes late as I arrive at the underground parking lot.  I park the car.  I lean over on the passenger seat with my elbow, and hear a crunching sound.  I pull myself up and discover I just broke one of the arms on my prescription eyeglasses.  Now I'm ticked.  I say to self, ""Now is a test of my resolve and ability to cope with stressful situations.  Yeah, that's it.  Yes, I will calm myself down and pretend nothing happened.  I can deal with the sunglasses later.  So.. I make my way over to one of those automated pay to park machines. Some other guy is ahead of me.  He gets his ticket, and discovers he got gypped on  $9.00 he put in.  He reluctantly, slowly walks away grumbling, so I deposit what change I had in the coin holder, a coin at a time, and all I had was $1.80. The machine has a message on the display: ""Insufficient money please deposit"" or something to that effect.  So now I'm screwed. I reason out I could take a chance, but quickly dismiss that thought, turn around go back to the car, get in, start 'er up and drive back home.  I come in and go to my daytimer on the wall to erase the appointment, and notice today is Friday the 13th.  I know there are measures I could have taken as preparation, it's just that it seemed everything was conspiring to go wrong. Very spooky!"

So I dismiss it and open a fruit bottom yogurt to eat while reading OFC, and there is NO FRUIT in the bottom!  Not as bad as your day, but still strange!  Tony"

So I get to the site and our sales guy measured the entire elevator wrong   All ticked off I get back to the office and call about the truck, ""it's ready"".
