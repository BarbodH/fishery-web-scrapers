215205,bucktail,2008-06-13 17:46:00,1857,Has anyone seen any deals on the Spro frogs out there. I find they have the best hooking % but at 10 dollars plus it starts to get expensive when your in toothy critter water fishng for bass?
215213,lookinforwalleye,2008-06-13 18:01:00,4399,I was at LB the other day and I think they were going for 7 and change.
215225,huntervasili,2008-06-13 18:20:00,1604,I love em... The spro frogs and scum frogs are my two favorites... I know what ya mean with the pike... I have had many go for it and reeling as fast as possible doesn't help much... I often loose 1/2 an inch of half the rubber fibres when I get a pike strike.
215386,allbusiness,2008-06-14 01:56:00,23,7 bucks each is a great deal  I pay 13$ plus tax for one  I think I'm getting ripped off.  Where is LB? Is it close to guelph/kitchener?
215401,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-14 03:20:00,2585,lb is lebarons in missasauga just off dundas is the closet to you.  cheers!
215451,Fang,2008-06-14 12:10:00,1330,fished em all since the first snag proof original came out years ago.  Spros are good but very pricey.  Scum Frogs best for $ IMHO. Try the new bigfoot model. They turned a lot of good fish for me last fall.  Grimsby tackle was clearing out tournament style frogs from Great Canadain baits. 3/$10. I bought 9 to try em out this year
215476,bucktail,2008-06-14 14:08:00,1857,7 bucks is a good deal!   Fang.  I will give those bigfoot models a go this year for sure.
