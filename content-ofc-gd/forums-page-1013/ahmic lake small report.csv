This year it was my first time fishing.  work has been crazy busy and havent had the time even to cast a line for an hour.  I was super excited.  I got held up in the big smoke and didnt end up checking in untill sunday at about midnight.  I was up early and fished all day monday, i was the only boat on the water all day!  It didnt get any better then that!  I didnt get into alot of fish.  Check that i caught alot of these. About 50 of them, mainly hitting my jig and grub.    I also caught my fair share of oos bass.  It was frustrating.  they were hitting big musky/pike spinner baits, jig and grub in 20 feet of water.  Even a spoon!  I guess they are done spawning on this lake?  I tried to move on if i got into 2 bass in one area but they were all over the place.     On monday the craziest thing happened to me.  I went out to a spot that was about a 25 minute boat ride.  the spot has a very small island.  all around it is a sharp drop off to 30 feet of water and its prime walleye and pike territory.  Well i was standing in the boat and all of a sudden i hear whhhhhhoooooooooooommmmmmmm!!!!  what the ---- it almost jumped me right out of the boat.  It was a seagull!!!  it swooped down at me and did it about 4 or 5 times.  I think it either had a nest on the island or it was mating season and they thought my rugged good looks and muskol scent was competition.  I caught this little video of it, if you listen close you can hear the whhhhooooooooommmmmm.  Visit My Website  Needless to say there scare tactics worked and i left my hotspot.  On tuesday I did get into a few walleye and pike, however i didnt get any pictures as the weather was bad and i didnt want to take my camera out of the water proof pouch.  Overall it was a great couple days with nobody on the water but me and the crazy a-- seagulls!  Can't wait to the long weekend where I will be fishing nipissing!  Cheers!"

215382,johnnyb,2008-06-14 01:44:00,3413,THat's like a clip from a certain Alfie Hitchcock movie!  Good luck on Nipissing...and be careful --  I think the cormorants can fly even faster than those gulls!
215394,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-14 02:21:00,2585," lolmyeah no kidding!  i cant wait, imo nipissing is the best lake in ontario when shes calm"
215457,ccmtcanada,2008-06-14 12:35:00,7971,LOL...great video!!  Nice report as well.  Bly and I will be fishing up there again the second week of August...and hopefully get into those elusive walleye again!
215607,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-15 01:26:00,2585," Yeah i remember you got into a nice ""eye"" on ahmic last year.  They are much harder to catch in the summer, in the spring they are all on the east end in the summer they scatter all over and end up in deep pockets.  Still catchable but not as easy.  I was at the weast end and its a 45 minutes boat ride to the river so that was unfortunately to far for me to go this trip.  Still one of my favorite areas in the province.  Cheers!"
