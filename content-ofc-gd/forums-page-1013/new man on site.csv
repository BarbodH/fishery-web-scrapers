215829,Newfieman,2008-06-15 22:32:00,19,Hi everyone this is newfieman I'm new to the site. I have heard lots of good things about it from my friend fishing fool. Just this year I started to really get back into fishing and I guess you could say I'm hooked.  I just bought a new 16' legend extreme and I try to get out every weekend with my buddy fishing fool. So far this spring we have done well on Balsome for crappie and Dalrymple.  The weekend of the 20th I have booked a cottage on pigon lake with the family and l am looking forward to fishing the lake for the first time.  Looking forward to chat Newfieman.{james}

You will like it on this site, lots of info and plenty of pics and the people will answer all your questions (no women or politics questions though) lol Check out the classifieds for the downrigger and baitcasters you are looking for. Sorry you missed the action on Balsam today, we did pretty well. Kept one under the slot and one over which was 25 1/2"" I caught about 6 in the 18"" range and Greg did about the same. We were rippin Bucktails through the weeds. Sorry, left my camera at home.  We'll hook up next weekend!!  Stan"
