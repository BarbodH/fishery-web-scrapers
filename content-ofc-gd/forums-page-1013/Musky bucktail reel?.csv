215698,Garry2Rs,2008-06-15 13:49:00,1425,"I would advise you to stay with a lower gear reel for all Musky baits.  Something around 5.3. Big baits block plenty of water and put a big strain on your wrist etc. cranking them in with a high gear reel. I tried to used a 6.2 Chronarch to crank Bucktails at the Moon River one time and learned my lesson...grin. High speed reels are okay for Bass size baits, but anything over an ounce will wear you out."
215700,Pigeontroller,2008-06-15 13:56:00,2793,The Abu Garcia 7000i HSN is nice 5:3 reel for bucktails. the large diameter spool and power handle will bring in Bucks plenty fast!  
215722,Musky or Specks,2008-06-15 16:04:00,2710,Yup thats what I use
215723,jediangler,2008-06-15 16:07:00,1923,"I use the Abu C4 because of the high ratio, 6.3 to 1. It's great for bulging the surface with bucktails. I have caught musky up to 48"" on it without a problem. I don't fish for musky 100 times a year though, but I've had the reel since 2001."
215731,Musky or Specks,2008-06-15 16:48:00,2710,Jedi  are you a member of KW MCI?
215746,danbo,2008-06-15 18:37:00,2646,I guess a Cardiff 400 will do..I don't get out like I used too!
215804,jediangler,2008-06-15 21:30:00,1923,"No MCI for me M&S. What did Groucho say, ""wouldn't want to be in any club that would have me as a member""."
215924,Raf,2008-06-16 02:10:00,3495,what do you mean by muskie bucktail?    the lure on your left (mepps muskie marabou) you can throw with a 200 curado.  the lure on your right will make a c4 tremble.
215968,jediangler,2008-06-16 04:30:00,1923,"Mepps Musky Killer. I tried some of the larger ones but I don't like double trebles, and I couldn't make them go fast enough for my liking. They're cheap, they're durable and they go 100mph. When I need to go faster I use the Giant Killer with the willow blade. "
216005,danbo,2008-06-16 11:51:00,2646,I like Blue Fox MuskyBucks!
216034,Musky or Specks,2008-06-16 13:26:00,2710,The bucktail on the right gets my jones going.   Jedi I just thought if you were a member I might know you.
