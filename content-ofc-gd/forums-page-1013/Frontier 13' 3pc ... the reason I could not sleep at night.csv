215146,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-06-13 14:54:00,0,"Ok, i know I have asked questions regarding steelhead rods for a while but still could not get convincing answers  Are there any OFNers who own Sheffield Select 13' 3pc rod? If there are, please give me your experience and opinions.  I am so sick of thinking about this over and over again!  The Frontier 13' 3pc rod I bought yesterday - is not significantly lighter than Sheffield - is much softer - costs me Can$300 - the rod still tips forward with my 4.5' Sheffield centerpin  Are there reasons why I should not return it? I wonder if its reflex action makes my cast further, easier? or what advantages it has when fighting fish?  I am looking for scientific facts not just personal opinions  Thanks again!"

215419,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-06-14 04:16:00,0,"Ok, I was so ticked that I actually weight them  Frontier: 5.6 ounce and it is 13' ft Sheffield: 5.4 ounces and it is 13'4 ft  I immediately returned the rod with no second thoughts  man, i love science"
215647,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-06-15 03:35:00,0,"With help from other friends, i also weighted the following  IMX 13' = 5.0 ounce GLX 13' = 3.5 ounce"
215679,aniceguy,2008-06-15 12:11:00,1094,A float rod doesnt catch fish the person holding it does.  That being said the frontier is a batson rod ( visit thier site for additional info) The sheffield is more then likely made in a factory where additional rods are made over seas. I will say the mandrels are more then likely a knock off on the taper of a higher end rod and the graphite is of IM6 material.  With the Loomis you are paying upwards of 100 for the name alone ( of which that name no longer exists) What I do recomend is scouring some sites ( FF.NET) and others in search of a decent used rod.
215822,kentooley,2008-06-15 22:17:00,208,Frontier is IM7 material.
215847,jace,2008-06-15 23:27:00,472,"   the rod can make fishing certain ways easier but i agree with the first statement.  I don't like noodlerods and i once went fishing with a friend on the bayfield.  I brought a short, stiffest spinning rod i have just to make a point.   I brought in the biggest fish of any we saw caught that day, a 9#-10# rainbow.  As far as the cost, a big part of that goes to warranty servicing also, just like Sage.  Although many companies have long term or lifetime warranties on their rods and blanks, from my experience, the higher premium priced rods/blanks  have the most painless replacement process including expedited service.  Just as normal shimano reels have good warranty servicing, but the top shelf reels like DC's include their lifetime Platinum service plan in the price"
