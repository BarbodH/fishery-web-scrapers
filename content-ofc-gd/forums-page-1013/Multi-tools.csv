215430,kickingfrog,2008-06-14 08:57:00,8333,"I noticed an add in a fishing magazine celebrating the 25th anniversary of Leathermans multi-tool (Wow, time flies!). I have the original (with the bit adapter), the wave and the micro. The wave is the one that I use the most when camping because it has locking blades.  I haven't used many of the other brands out there, so: What are your likes and dislikes for multi-tools? Do you prefer the real original Swiss army?  Can you tell that it's 5 in the morning and I've been up for a couple hours because I can't sleep?"
215432,jace,2008-06-14 09:53:00,472,"I almost bought one of the anniversary edition PST's when i saw them about a month ago but i didn't think it was for me because i like to use my stuff and don't baby anything.  I have mostly leatherman brand multitools.  One original PST from about 15 years ago, maybe more.  a PST2, Charge Ti, a micro, and a wave which is my least favorite..too cheap feeling compared to the other full size models.  I tried 3 Gerbers and i won't be trying another, one full size and two pocket size.   The only one i can name is the keychain model which is the Solstice.   Gerbers okay but don't feel as solidly made, i don't think any of the imitation brand multitools are as well made/designed as a real leatherman.  just like Visegrips and Channel-locks, nothing equals the originals.  I forgot about swiss army.  good knives but i'm always so disappointed when a plastic side broke, cracked or started chipping or wearing away which happens to all of them.  The metal sided models never appealed to me.     One day when i have a bag of money to blow, i might be tempted to get a super geek novelty model that i saw on tv, it has absolutely everything and it's about 5-6"" wide."
215439,kickingfrog,2008-06-14 11:21:00,8333,"For me the Swiss Army knives lack of locking blades is an issue (Need all my digits for spherin'). I've never thought wave as ""cheap feeling"", but that's me, and a difference of opinion makes a horse race. Of course I own a better ""pocket"" knife, better pliers and better screw drivers, but I'm not bringing all of them on a canoe trip or carrying them in my tackle box."
215441,ChrisK,2008-06-14 11:31:00,2772,Gerber for me. I like the slide action of the pliers
215444,Greencoachdog,2008-06-14 11:34:00,8163,"I own both Leathermans and Gerbers, and prefer the Gerbers hands down... much better quality IMO. I think I have every model of Leatherman and Gerber, my favorite is the 700 series Gerber Fisherman. I use it for both Saltwater and Freshwater fishin, very high quality cutting blades on it too!  Never that impressed with the Swiss Army knife."
215446,danbo,2008-06-14 11:47:00,2646,I like the cheap ones from the flea market..if I lose 'em..who cares. If I lend 'em & never see them again..oh well!
215448,kickingfrog,2008-06-14 11:58:00,8333, I like the idea of the slide action but since I haven't lost or broken my other ones I don't need to buy a new one... yet.
215449,Greencoachdog,2008-06-14 12:07:00,8163," You ""need"" a collection of them!... that way I can borrow a couple..."
215458,kickingfrog,2008-06-14 12:42:00,8333," So much to buy, so little to spend."
215461,Billy Bob,2008-06-14 13:05:00,5865,None of them ever appealed to me. I have a small tool box in my truck that I can do almost anything with and just a few hand tools in the boat. There is not too much you can do on the water anyways so I have no need for a lot of tools aboard.  A good knife is always a must. I have three in the truck and 5 in the boat
215464,forrest,2008-06-14 13:28:00,1032,"I like the 2 $5 CTC multi-tools I have.  The pliers are large and have come in handy, bottle opener is great, no locking blade though.  I leave them sitting around and would never feel too bad about loosing them.  My small swiss army does have a locking blade, sissors and a few useless items.  Its small and I do not have to worry about loosing it: $15 PS: it came with a salmon emblem on the side that is a bit of a mystery because it is not geared for fishing.  forrest"
215475,glen,2008-06-14 14:07:00,2641,"I like a 3"" swiss army knife because it is small in your pocket.  As for the multi-tool i dont use one very much."
215483,Greencoachdog,2008-06-14 14:27:00,8163,"This is my Gerber 700 series Fisherman:   Very long needle nose pliers for easy hook removal.  Fiskars scissors for cutting braided line  File w/ hook sharpener groove (other side)  Smooth and serrated blades (razor sharp!)  Screw drivers  Awl  Bottle opener  Replaceable wire cutter blade  Crimping tool  I can have a hook out of a fish before a Cat can lick his  All tools lock in place.  Stores in a nylon sheath on my belt, always at my finget tips!"
215487,tibbs,2008-06-14 14:51:00,650,I have the Swiss Champ swiss army knife.  It has everything including the kitchen sink!
215492,Burtess,2008-06-14 15:32:00,901,"I started out years ago with a Leatherman PST (got it from my in-laws, best gift they ever got me!) and now use a Charge Ti. Wouldn't use anything else, the handles on the Charge Ti are much more robust than any of the stamped handles out there.  Burt"
215517,huntervasili,2008-06-14 17:49:00,1604," Agreed... I have the Gerber recoil (spring loaded pliers) and love the thing... great when when you have a fish, all you have to do is press the button and remove the hook!"
215597,Clampet,2008-06-15 00:22:00,1947," Geez GCD, I never realized how serious you take this stuff! I pity the fool that speaks ill of a Gerber 700 series Fisherman."
215962,holdfast,2008-06-16 04:05:00,1813,"Around 1994 I watched a documentary on Canadian Engineers clearing Booby Traps around a water pump house in Croatia on the Fifth Estate as my friend WO Dan Hartford narrated as one of his men was cutting a trip Wire with a Leatherman.  Danny slyly mentioned that QUOTE "" his soldier had bought the Leatherman with his own money because the Army didnt see fit to buy it for their Soldiers.  Within a Month the Engineers were given a leatherman which became our most important tool.  A few years later they went with Gerbers, but after a couple of years they went back to Leatherman because the Gerber would pinch the hand and the jaws would break.  I some how kept my leatherman as they are a returned piece of kit that has to be signed for.  My Opinion, leatherman if you got the money, or Carolina selling in CTC.  On sale this week with a decent rugged knife."
215964,jwl,2008-06-16 04:09:00,1056,"I got one I won in a fishing derby, it was in a Remington kit with a multi-tool, a buck knife and flashlight  in a nice litle wooden box, it's pretty handy to have around camp"
