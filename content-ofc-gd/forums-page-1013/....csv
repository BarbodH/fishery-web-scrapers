215421,Sinker,2008-06-14 04:47:00,8692,"Geeze...am I gonna have to come up there and show you how to catch some eyes for dinner? Man, its easy.  Just keep it light, and use live bait. You can't go wrong. It shouldn't even be legal its so easy......how can they resist a perfectly presented minnow? I use a 7' ultra light rod, with 6lb line. Use as little weight as you can get away with, and still keep contact with bottom.  I usually use a white 3"" grub, on the lightest jig I can get away with, depending on conditions. Just a slow drag along bottom, just fast enought to keep the tail turning. They'll pick it up light, so if you even think it might be a fish....set the hook!!  Good luck up there bud, I might just show up.....ya never know  Sinker"

Johnson's silver minnow tipped with twister.... anything that'll keep ya above the abundant weeds  works ... in deeper water the X-Rap works well.  Walleye .... well .... go where all the other boats are after supper. Bring worms and jigs with a trailer hook.  Was there last weekend in the rain and did pretty good...lotsa medium sized fish... nothing that was camera worthy... but alot off fun.   Good Luck.  Randy
