2439,fishdawg,2006-11-20 00:46:00,912,"take as much stuff outta the boat as you can & cover 'er up as tight as you can  - if your gonna pay someone to winterize, you mzy as well pay for shrink wrap too while your at at it.  Motors arent difficult to winterize your self, but again if its your first year, for warranty sake you can have someone ""authorized"" to do it. Maybe you can watch whomever do it & then you'll know how next yr.  Batteries - take all of em out, unhook your sonar units & bring em inside. Batteries - keep them off any cement floors & give a charge every two months untill you ""spring-ize"" your boat  im from an expert, its all i can offer to ya"
