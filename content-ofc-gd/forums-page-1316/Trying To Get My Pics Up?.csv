2380,tjsa,2006-11-19 23:06:00,1578,"download this program that Terry put me onto a few years back:  http://www.download3000.com/download-Visua...t-reg-8155.html  Windows XP resizer probably works also, but I have never used it.  Make a folder on your desktop called anything you like. copy your pics into it. Start up this program, and point it to that folder, then hit resize. It will make a new folder in that folder called resized.  Point your attatchments to that resized folder and files therein, and all will be good.  And get the lead out will ya, we want pictures, lol."
2397,mepps,2006-11-19 23:30:00,1301,You probably want your images 640x480 and under 80k in size. The above post certaily provides teh tools to make it happen.
2408,tjsa,2006-11-19 23:44:00,1578,"Oh yeah Mepps, I did set the parameters for 640 x 480 for resizing, forgot about that. Did that a couple of years back, and that setting has been there ever since. It's the little fiddly details we forget to mention, lol."
2421,Greencoachdog,2006-11-20 00:14:00,8163,"I'm sure that program will work real well...but would prolly be quicker and easier to use the ""bucket""... not to mention the space given to each post is kinda small, 3 or 4 decent pics and that's about it... with the ""bucket"" you can plaster them all over the place if ya want!"
2422,bigfish1965,2006-11-20 00:15:00,3382,We've had a few guys try to upload 2 or 3 Mb pics. It has to be a reasonable size. 150K or less is ideal.
2425,setomonkey,2006-11-20 00:21:00,872,"photobucket works, or you can resize your pictures and upload them here. I like Irfanview, it's a free viewer that you can use to resize pics. Also lets you cut & crop, so you can focus the photo on what you want.  Mike"
2437,tjsa,2006-11-20 00:44:00,1578,"Since the new board started up, we can now upload pics directly from our pc's without the use of photobucket, or other pic hosting sites. As long as they are not to big, megapixel wise. http://www.download3000.com/download-Visua...t-reg-8155.html The above program allow us to do that, probably window XP resizer also, but like I said, I have never used it, got used to the above program and use it all the time. It usually resizes to less than 100k for my 3.2 mp full size pics. Never had an issue here, or with other similar software boards."
2535,sturgman,2006-11-20 03:53:00,249,Good link Tom. Will it work for windows 98? Im still in the stone age here
