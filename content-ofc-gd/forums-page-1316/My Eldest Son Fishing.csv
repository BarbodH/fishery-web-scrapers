1658,ccmtcanada,2006-11-18 03:47:00,7971,"Hey there Nautifish...or Amazon...or whatever....hehe  I watched more of your videos tonite.  Great job on them!! You have a real talent for editing clips!  My fav was the fishing with family and friends video.    It really captured the fun of fishing.  Oh yeah....there was that one video I hope no one here sees (You know....Amazon girls gone wild)....sorry I had to mark that one ""offensive"" because of adult content....."
1678,nautifish,2006-11-18 04:36:00,1416,My fav was the fishing with family and friends video. It really captured the fun of fishing.   LOL  Actually that happens to be my favorite also....I think its because its more a poor mans fishing video....lol  Not all of us can afford the big fancy boats and all the equipment that goes with them.  Or fishing  holidays down to to the bahamas or fly ins to certain spots up north or where ever.  But in my videos I like to show people it does not matter whether u have a boat or not...You do not need all the fancy equipment & you most certainly do not need to have lots of money.  You can still go out have a great time and catch some great fish.    I have a video of me and rich when i caught a double header carp.....Another of my favs.. It really is a funny video. But there is some naughty language on there so am not posting it because i know we have young ones that read the forums. 
1709,JFR,2006-11-18 10:35:00,498,"Hey Amo or Nautifish, nice video, good quality, not jerky or shaky.  Thank you for sharing  John"
