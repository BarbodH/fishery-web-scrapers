1409,Chris,2006-11-17 19:34:00,405,"Hi, I've seen a similar post in the past and thought it was cool seeing everyone's old fishing pics. Here's a few pics from the past. This is my dad on the right and my Uncle Mike with some Lake Nippissing walleye in 1960   This is my grandmother, probably on the St. Lawrence with what appears to be a small pike or muskie. The date on the back of the picture is 1949   I don't have any info on this picture, but it appears to be my Uncle Stuart. It was in with the other pics from 1949 so I'm assuming it's from that era, and probably taken in Cornwall. "

1679,cisco,2006-11-18 04:35:00,597,Nice pics. Thanks!  The beer bottles stump me since I thought stubbies were around till the 70's.
1685,Nemo,2006-11-18 04:49:00,727,Love those pics. Thanks for posting  Here are some of my fav's  http://www.antiquefishingreels.com/galleryFishing.html
1875,Chris,2006-11-18 20:00:00,405," Thanks guys. Cisco, if you look closely those are the old quart bottles.  Lew, I learned to fish using an old extra long bamboo pole similar to the one in the pic."
1878,Rattletrap2,2006-11-18 20:10:00,1652,"Good eye there Cisco! I was going to say, that North Bay was the only place I ever saw those ""Quart"" bottles. Why is that anyhow? I saw them there in the 80's, but no where else to my knowledge."
1896,mattyk,2006-11-18 21:26:00,2110,That last picture was really cool!

2206,setomonkey,2006-11-19 16:12:00,872,"I really like the old pics, maybe because my parents didn't fish and I only started fishing as an adult (so I don't have the same history as a lot of OFNers do).  Mike"
