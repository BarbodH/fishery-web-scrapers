1596,Rizzo,2006-11-18 00:57:00,4754,"I got skunked in 2 days last week-end on the upper.  I had planned on going back this week-end, but when I saw the forecast of big winds on Thurs and Friday I cancelled.  Gonna stay in my nice warm bed instead.  Not sure if the winds ever materialized, but I'm staying put."
