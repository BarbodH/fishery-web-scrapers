1805,bigfish1965,2006-11-18 16:22:00,3382,PM any mod and we will delete it for you.We had trouble with some stirring the pot then deleting the post.
1806,TJQ,2006-11-18 16:23:00,7806,Rick... You'll have to help with this one... ive got all the edit buttons.. but Im sure reg users dont see 'em...
1916,sturgman,2006-11-18 22:14:00,249,"Mods, is it possible to add a ""delete thread"" button to the common users like me? It would have come in handy yesterday when i created the red fridays survey.After it was oficially posted i was unhappy that the pic I thought was putting up wasnt there. At that time I would have liked to pull it and try again, but wasnt able too. Not being whinny here, just a suggestion.  You guys have done a faboulous job with the new site!!"
1923,bigfish1965,2006-11-18 22:37:00,3382,"You an always edit your post, sturg, but I have no way to differentiate common users from uncommon.. Rather than pull it and try again, just go back and fix it."
1925,sturgman,2006-11-18 22:48:00,249,"thanks Rick,  Its not always easy @ 2 a.m after a few wobblys!!"
