1300,ehg,2006-11-17 17:27:00,2666,"Did this post on last couple of versions of board. Trying out the new system   Anyways, about 1998 caught a musky in about 45 ft of water while jigging for walleye. Realizing quickly that it was a musky i reeled it in nice and slow letting it decompress itself. Was using 6 lb. test but brought it in anyways since i was concerned the stinger would fuse the upper and lower jaws shut. A few years later i caught a musky on a shallow shelf adjacent to the deeper water. No big deal, used the cradle quick photo and released. A few years later flipping through musky pics these two were back to back. They sure looked somewhat similar, but the white bar above the tail fin was the give away.  If there the same sure shows proper care and handling (C&R) helps when fishing these beasts. Fish looks stronger and healthier second time around.    cheers,  ehg"
1318,dustink,2006-11-17 17:43:00,526,So cool....that's good Karma getting back to you from the first release!  nicely done.  dk
1321,Nemo,2006-11-17 17:44:00,727,Not sure bout the Musky but it looks like you're wearing the same coat. LOL
1324,TJQ,2006-11-17 17:46:00,7806,LOL.. no its definatly two different coats... but i could see where you could be mistaken...
1326,GbayGiant,2006-11-17 17:49:00,1780,"Nice fish, they do look similar and there both nice. I accidently caught my two fist muskies walleye fishing as well both on worm harnesses in the same year, that's what got me started. I wonder how many more I would have got walleye fishing instead of using my big musky gear."
1341,setomonkey,2006-11-17 18:23:00,872,"I can't tell if they are teh same (same opinion I had in the previous boards, I think), but they are both nice pictures!  Mike"
1344,kemper,2006-11-17 18:28:00,2232,"If you ask me, I think the first fish is longer than the second. Which would mean that it cant be the same fish...but they sure do look alike."
1349,Puckhead,2006-11-17 18:31:00,377,"They look damn close... Can't tell 100% but the fin markings do look similar - Call them the same, what are the chances of catching two musky with near identical markings anyway..."
1359,kemper,2006-11-17 18:46:00,2232,"Well I saved both pics to my computer and used the photo editor to look at the size ratio of the head of each fish to the body. In my opinion, musky one is definatly longer.  but im no scientist  Just bored... lol"
1362,snag,2006-11-17 18:51:00,1932,"The Musky loves you.  Could be a re-incarnated fishing buddy or relative.  Try talking to it.  One swish of the tail for Yes, two for No."
1402,Pete Maina,2006-11-17 19:31:00,213,"Boy, that fish sure looks similar to me. Interesting thing is if it is the same one, it appears to have a better build than prior, which is cool.  Either way, it's way cool.  Pete"
1404,TJQ,2006-11-17 19:33:00,7806, Maybe it was working out to impress the ladies....
1430,Rippinlips,2006-11-17 20:00:00,16,"Look very close at the head,especially the gill plate, the markings are almost identical. I noticed where the black fades into the lighter colour and the lines are exactly the same IMO. Very nice both fish or the same onr lol. Excellent"
1436,pikeie,2006-11-17 20:12:00,380,"nice fish there, they do look alot alike tho, hey who knows it might be the same fish!"
1440,lunkerbasshunter,2006-11-17 20:22:00,2585,sure looks like the same fish but i wonder what the size difference is on them?  you think after a few years it would grow?  or is the growth rate that slow as musky mature?  Anyway great fish!  Cheers!
1452,Guest mistyriver1,2006-11-17 20:31:00,0,"ehg, I remember you posting that before.  Sure, looks like the same guy/gay ?? to me.  Nice fish"
1491,Jigger,2006-11-17 21:26:00,1237,They are both most definately Musky. Other than that...  .
1522,DT10Sam,2006-11-17 22:24:00,480,"That Musky caught the same guy.  Regards, Sam"
1550,Squid,2006-11-17 23:20:00,1656,Nice fish either way.
1692,ehg,2006-11-18 05:16:00,2666,"Thought that the second picture makes the fish look shorter. Its that bar of white, posterior to the caudal peduncle, that is unique in both fish. Most other things match up as well. Ya but whatever...  Are you saying that muskies can be gay? Whatever floats your boat!  cheers,  ehg"
1729,Guest mistyriver1,2006-11-18 12:52:00,0,  I meant guy/gal
2356,ehg,2006-11-19 21:37:00,2666,"No worries, MistyR1"
2570,Fisherpete,2006-11-20 06:10:00,1814,"had a similar experience last summer with a 34"" Musky my buddy caught, and then I caught the same fish, in the same spot, with the SAME LURE two weeks later!!! (Mepps #5 glow) I guess this guy didn't learn his lesson the first time! Here's the 2 pics...    "
