2144,Brian,2006-11-19 14:09:00,33,Ya looks good from here to.  Although I was just getting the old one figured out. lol
2165,JFR,2006-11-19 14:53:00,498,"Manly board, Yes, but I like it too"
1288,Dave2,2006-11-17 17:12:00,33,"Why did we have to have a new ""board"""
1306,misfish,2006-11-17 17:34:00,29133,To keep up with the Jonzes.
1312,Puckhead,2006-11-17 17:38:00,377,Something to do?
1314,ccmtcanada,2006-11-17 17:40:00,7971,I believe the security features from an admin standpoint are much better.  There seems to be more flexibiilty and user features here as well....and well....yes...to keep up with the Joneses?
1315,Nemo,2006-11-17 17:40:00,727,Ya Something to do with the watchamacallit and how the the thing a ma jig connects to the ISP u know.....
1316,TJQ,2006-11-17 17:41:00,7806,"I feel like I should answer this as its come up a few times..  The first thing was that the photogallery was hacked and beat up pretty badly.. which meant that I was going to have to reinstall a new one anyway....  Secondly, more than a few new fishing messageboards have popped up recenly and I realized.. after much himming and hawing (ask the mods.... they'll tell ya.. lol ) We decided that it was time to step this up to a whole new level.  So our resident geek who is an invision powerboard supermasterooo... set this up...  This way we will keep on top of all upgrades and we have a board, photo gallery and members only classifieds all in one place... permanently..  I also realize that a feature rich board like this is getting to take some getting used to, but that progress for ya....  Oh yes... and there are a TON of great new features to help us moderate better...  stinkin Jonzes anyway..."
1327,98Fahrenheit,2006-11-17 17:51:00,108,"I like the look and feel of this ""new"" board.  Way better than the previous one which was kinda plain.  That's my two cents."
1337,cityfisher,2006-11-17 18:14:00,959,I think the new board is a great idea  rich in features and looks really clean and professional
1338,The Urban Fisherman,2006-11-17 18:20:00,2050,"Well this thread give me the opportunity to say ""THE NEW OFC ROCKS"" good job guys!  I think I speak on behalf of the whole gang when I say you did a great job!  Cheers, UF"
1340,BabyHerc,2006-11-17 18:23:00,285,"I may be alone on this one but I like the new OFC MUUUUUUUUCH better.  Those Jones's, always tryin' to one-up us... I'll show them *clenched fist*."
1343,Puckhead,2006-11-17 18:24:00,377,Great call - this new board is brilliant!!  All the hemming and hawing was worth it if this was the result!
1350,trapshooter,2006-11-17 18:37:00,1234,Waaaay Better!!!  Thanks TJ and Everyone else involved.  Ben.
1365,bigfish1965,2006-11-17 18:54:00,3382,"I think Gerritt was bugging TJ to go php about 5 years ago and then I started on him about  2 years ago too, so there was a real team effort to get TJ into the 21st Century."
1368,Seahag,2006-11-17 18:59:00,19,This will definitely take some getting used to.  Lots of everything everywhere.  A little overwhelming with options and features.  I'm sure over time (a week) we will all be back to normal.  I will say it was a little annoying to have to re register and get my post count back but i guess pretty minor if this is going to make the board better.
1371,paxlux,2006-11-17 19:04:00,6,"From what I've seen so far you guys did an awsome job, keep it up"
1382,redfin,2006-11-17 19:14:00,79,first try
1542,Mike Pike,2006-11-17 23:08:00,1332,"Like anything new, it'll take a bit of getting used to but, man, she looks pretty slick!  Nice work guys.  I'm guessing it took many hours of work but when it finally comes together, it must feel good, eh?  Cheers!"
1565,Gerritt,2006-11-18 00:15:00,6129,"  Yup and the miserable bugger fought me tooth and nail LOL .... I see the posts about ""Why Change?"" that was TJQ's exact response back in the day  Now look where we are!! This had to happen I am sure you and I both saw it coming Rick... you can only use a website that is ""ducktaped"" together for so long  Good job boys.  Gerritt."
1575,misfish,2006-11-18 00:30:00,29133,"Hey Gerritt  Thats a good look,n young,n you got there.What a cutie."
1579,DT10Sam,2006-11-18 00:33:00,480,"And I like it too!  Regards, Sam"
1587,PatB,2006-11-18 00:44:00,104,"I like the new board, just went throught most of it,. Fantastic job Rick and TJ."
1612,Rich Clemens,2006-11-18 01:45:00,3131,"Yeah - This is gonna be a learning curve.  Seems like there is just so much here, gonna take me quite a while just to see what all the mods put into this one.  Looks like a lot of great things here."
1732,Gerritt,2006-11-18 12:58:00,6129,Hey Thanks MisFish....He's my little man!  Here is a larger one    Gerritt.
1742,Greencoachdog,2006-11-18 13:30:00,8163,"This new board is Most Excellent!!! I Really like all the new features and the new graphic design... except for one thing, can we get a new skin chooser in here ASAP? That piece of DRIFTWOOD at the top is Really Freakin' Me Out Man!!!... It keeps Lookin' at me and Mockin' Me! If I Had A Virtual Ax, I'd Hack It To Smithers and BURN It!!!"
1755,rob v,2006-11-18 14:18:00,535,My first attempt on the new board. Board looks good.
