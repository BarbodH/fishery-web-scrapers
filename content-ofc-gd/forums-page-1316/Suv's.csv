2032,sunfire50,2006-11-19 03:38:00,5,"Honestly this is my last time asking for advice! I have narrowed my search down to either a Ford Explorer -8cyl or a jeep cherokee 8cyl, If anyone has anything good or bad to say I would love to know.   Thanks"
2172,sunfire50,2006-11-19 15:02:00,5,No one owns one of these trucks or can give some advice?
2230,aplumma,2006-11-19 16:53:00,6896,I own neither and you posted this on the weekend of the G2G. someone might post a reply during the week when they get back.  Art
2244,bigfish1965,2006-11-19 17:21:00,3382,All I know about those two choices is...I hope you own a gas station.
2275,pigeonfisher,2006-11-19 18:10:00,696,I have driven a number of explorers.  The I can't stand it for the leg room.  Havn't been in a cherokee for a few years. so no comment there.
2281,Rizzo,2006-11-19 18:17:00,4754," Can't help you on those vehicles, but I agree with the above statement.  With the price of gas these days, and the amount those pigs use up, if a 6 would do I'd opt for that"
2291,sunfire50,2006-11-19 18:27:00,5,"test drove a few 6 cylinders and 8 cylinders of both makes on the highway for 80+K and the 8's get better milage. I couldn't believe it myself. As for searching the net for advice the problem is that there are way more explorers out there so needless to say more complaints. What I am worried about is on each and trying to research is Jeeps transmitions, air cond, Fords all aluminum V8, Sealed transmition (no dip stick to check fluid) both of thier long term reliability."
2298,Daplumma,2006-11-19 18:41:00,1961,For the kind of mileage you are gonna get you may as well just get a Suburban or a full size.If the Jeep is a grand Cherokee I know they used to get terrible gas mileage.Good luck! Joe
2323,sunfire50,2006-11-19 19:47:00,5,15 to 20K hopefully
2326,Rizzo,2006-11-19 19:55:00,4754,"the problem with some of those on-line reviews is that its the people who are upset, looking to vent, write them.  I nearly backed out of buying a Pacifica because of the horrible on-line reviews. Went ahead and got one despite all the ""doom and gloom reviews"" and we've been very happy with it.  Sometimes you just have to go with your gut feeling"
2411,sunfire50,2006-11-19 23:53:00,5,"I to thought about the pacifica, nice looking vehicle"
2417,Rizzo,2006-11-20 00:06:00,4754,"we picked ours up last December, it was a 2005 with 32,000 kms on it.  Paid 23,500.  Nice car, 6 bucket seats, all leather.  The drawback like a lot of these bigger vehicles is the gas consumption"
2587,slumberbunny,2006-11-20 11:35:00,2," I own a '99 GC with the I6... I didn't want the 8 for 2 reasons: 1- fuel 2- the 4x4 setup is not as versatile (The QuadraTrac is actually a better system but you don't get to pick 4x4 or not). However, the rear seal can blow out and it's big bucks. With the I6 it uses totally different Selectrac 4x4 and that transmission is bullet proof. The extra 50hp would be nice sometimes though"
2600,sturgeonx,2006-11-20 12:36:00,1,"My father in law is on his 3rd Grand Cherokee and has no complaints, sure its hard on gas but so is my Ford Escape V6 and the tank is so small on the thing you are always filling it up.  Sturgeonx"
2636,JFR,2006-11-20 14:12:00,498,"Neither is a CHEV, can't help, now if you were looking for a real SUV"
2684,Tomcat,2006-11-20 15:29:00,395,"I've owned my 6 cylinder 4.0 litre Ford Explorer XLT 4 X 4 since 1991. Its been sprayed every year with RustCheck and has its original paint. Highway mileage has routinely been 24/25 mpg. Although I only have 170,000 km on this vehicle, maintenance costs have been acceptable. I have no reasons to recommend not buying a Ford Explorer. However, if I were buying another one, and I wanted to use it as a tow vehicle, I would opt for an 8 cylinder."
