1826,TJQ,2006-11-18 16:59:00,7806,Could be some really good deals here for anyone in the Toronto area.  http://www.woodscanada.com/  Good bye to a great product....
1831,Nemo,2006-11-18 17:09:00,727,Just FYI it has been going on for a few weeks so a lot of the good stuff like tents and packs are gone but still some sleeping bags etc.  Sad part is all product will now be made offshore.
1834,brookieman,2006-11-18 17:16:00,68,"Just came back from the sale.  Almost nothing good left, although they had one Arctic 2 Star sleeping bag left for $ 169.99.  All the good packs are gone, no canvas left and no prospector tents.  Bug jackets are only in small and x-small.  They have a ton of parkas left though for at least 50 % off."
1882,Fisherman,2006-11-18 20:20:00,7201," Ya, it's almost a novelty to find something made in the western hemisphere."
1883,Gerritt,2006-11-18 20:22:00,6129,western hemisphere???  Gerritt.
