1844,woodro,2006-11-18 17:53:00,168,ya man it was insane how fast that little adjustment changed my day. Its always good to change it up if the regular is not producing.
1946,canadian_copper,2006-11-18 23:29:00,925,YA HAVE TO PLAY WITH DEPTH ALL THE TIME!!! FISH ARENT ALWAYS SITTING ON BOTTOM!!! WHEN THERE SUSPENED YOU CAN DRIFT RIGHT UNDER THEM ALL DAY LONG!!! FISH LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD AND UP!! SO RUNNIN SHORT WHEN THERE SUSPENDED PAYS OFF WELL!!
1976,BrownTown,2006-11-19 01:06:00,103,"i would add some comments, but alot of guys gave examples i was going to use!! awesome info guys!"
1995,wishn4fishn,2006-11-19 02:27:00,108,"Don't forget to play around with your shotting arrangment for the appropriate drift.  Stacking or evenly spread out makes a world of difference.  Don't forget flies such as wooly buggers, nymphs and stoneflies."
1292,madtekniques,2006-11-17 17:17:00,15,"If you care to share, what has been producing for Steelhead the last couple weeks?  Roe? Worms? Spinners?  I was out last weekend with no luck on roe or pink worms under a float."
1309,BabyHerc,2006-11-17 17:36:00,285,"All of the Above!  Possibly no fish where you were fishing, hence no takers.  Give it a go today, tomorrow, and the next few days; this rain should bring in a few fresh fish, ready to hit whatever you throw at 'em."
1323,wuchikubo,2006-11-17 17:46:00,1114,"All should work including some spoons, vary your presentation speed to see how active they are.  HF"
1346,wishn4fishn,2006-11-17 18:29:00,108,"try plastics, different roe imitations and steelhead jigs work well"
1347,kemper,2006-11-17 18:30:00,2232,"This rain should help, Ive been out a few times lately but the water has been WAY to low and clear. When you can see the fish, and identify them as male or female, and pick out the browns in the pool, you probably wont catch any!"
1393,tonyb,2006-11-17 19:26:00,1637,"All of the above!  Roe generally works well this time of year, as do spinners, and worms after a rain  Tony"
1396,Rich,2006-11-17 19:27:00,3927,Chartreuse roe bags right now.. big ones!
1449,tonyb,2006-11-17 20:30:00,1637,"LOL Rich, I was looking at my roe tying supplies, have peach, white, hot pink, but NOT chartreuse.  Might have to hit Bronte Outdoors after work.  It looks like I am going to be breaking out the Oreo's and hitting a trib tomorrow.  It's gonna be blown, but it beats doing nothing.  Tony"
1455,Rich,2006-11-17 20:34:00,3927,Well the pink usually works well in the mud too but I am too stubborn to switch from my chartreuse ;D
1459,kemper,2006-11-17 20:40:00,2232,"  Ill be doing the same, tying up some HUGE pink and chartruse bags right now."
1505,canadian_copper,2006-11-17 21:48:00,925,FALL CHROME IS ROE AND JIGS TIME!!! ROE IN MORN AND WHEN BITE STOPS ITS TIME TO GET JIGGY WITH IT!!!
1507,FishHeadRic,2006-11-17 21:49:00,226,It's still warm enough to gather earth worms as well.  I've had great success just running 2 or 3 smaller ones  under a float like a roe bag.  FHR
1508,tonyb,2006-11-17 21:52:00,1637,"Copper,  Do you use a slip float and twitch the jig, or run it like a roe bag and let the current work it's undulations on the maribou?  Tony"
1511,setomonkey,2006-11-17 21:54:00,872,"Out of curiosity, how big is BIG? Quarter-sized? Loonie?  Mike"
1512,canadian_copper,2006-11-17 21:55:00,925,TONY IF THERE IS ANY CURRENT AT ALL OR EVEN A WIND CHOP ON THE SURFACE THERE IS NO NEED TO TWITCH IT!! WATER SUPPLIES THE ACTION FOR YA!!! IN DEAD CALM WATER AND NO CHOP I TWITCH IT JUST ABIT EVERY 2 FT IT DRIFTS!!! PERSONALLY I DONT USE A SLIP FLOAT!!
1515,tonyb,2006-11-17 22:00:00,1637,Thanks man!
1527,charlied,2006-11-17 22:38:00,584,got 2 on small pink worm and gulp black shad minnow under a float.
1578,The Urban Fisherman,2006-11-18 00:33:00,2050,jeez all this steelie talk - i'm going to end up getting myself into trouble this weekend by sneaking out for some fishing!!!  Good luck guys UF
1635,Kerry,2006-11-18 02:46:00,383,"Ok Copper you got me wonderin as I've never tried a jig.What size do you use 1/16,1/8?Do you dress it with marabou or plastic.I use 6lb line and don't go under that and probably wouldn't need to right now with the current amount of runoff. Kerry"
1656,kemper,2006-11-18 03:43:00,2232," Heres some sizes Id carry on any given day. Please ignore the el cheapo roe, its all ive got at the moment.     Crap....what did I do  again...  THERE SHE IS! I like this link the picture straight from the computer business!  So i used something that I know more than a few OFNers recognise as a reference. Corona cap to the right, dime to the left."
1696,ehg,2006-11-18 05:31:00,2666,Alot of excellent info for the same question i was pondering. Who needs floatfishing.net?  Great thread. Thanks!  ehg
1726,ChrisK,2006-11-18 12:27:00,2772, Also try these while floatfishing.... cut baits like the end of squid tenticles(this works) dead minnows work too  Good Luck !!
1828,canadian_copper,2006-11-18 17:01:00,925,AS FOR ROE SIZE U HAVE TO CARRY THEM ALL!!! FROM 2EGGS ALL THE WAY UP TO A TOONIE(VERY DIRTY WATER)  I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WEIGHT THE JIGS ARE!!! THERE MARABOU JIGS TIED BY JIM BUTLER! RIVERWOOD JIGS THERE CALLED !!! SMALL AND LIGHT!!! NEW COMP SO I DONT HAVE A PIC OFF HAND !!!
1832,woodro,2006-11-18 17:11:00,168,"most of the time its not the roe bag, size, colour etc, its the way it is presented!! the other day i fished for over  1.5hrs with guys nailing fish, i couldnt ge one to bite until i changed my leader no more then 8"", as soon as that little change was made i landed 5 fish in one hour. I think it may have slowed the bait down just enough for the steelies to take a good look at it. all on different roe (trout/salmon) in a variety of colours"
1837,madtekniques,2006-11-18 17:28:00,15,"Great replies everyone, thanks a lot.  woodro, that's interesting I'll have to make sure I try different lengths when I get out tomorrow."
