Its always funny to see a hookup on walleye tackle, because the odds of actually landing the thing is about none. You can tell when a boat has one because everyone on board is running around like a chicken with its head off trying to figure out what the hell to do.  Its quite common to see them jumping."
1996,smellin fishy,2006-11-19 02:27:00,21,I've heard of 85lbers caught in the St. Clair River near Sarnia.  I have heard of them being caught of the Leamington Marina (Western Lake Erie) roghly 25 years ago.  Big Ones.  Haven't seen any though.
2026,bje,2006-11-19 03:22:00,11, Thanks for the info! I'm not surprised. Personally I thought a fish that size in the great lakes would be an absolute freak of nature. I also thought it was interesting that the caption said it took about 6hrs to land???  and was caught at 11AM. In May - it would still be light out at 5PM!!! This pic was taken in the dark.  Oh well - still a nice fish - wherever it was caught!
2030,Moosebunk,2006-11-19 03:33:00,3970," Sharp spines down the backs of these fish, especially the smaller ones.  Use a glove or towel if handy, and tail it.  If it's a big fish, once tailed roll it over in the water belly up then stick your hand right in it's mouth.  Log roll it into your arms and into the boat.  Keep it subdued and don't let it thrash about in the boat so to hurt itself."

1803,Moosebunk,2006-11-18 16:19:00,3970,"Here's a story behind the fish.  The guide is definetely ""FishWhisperer""   Asger Michaelsen with his 11 ft. trophy sturgeon On Nov.16, 2006, we have hooked, landed, tagged and carefully released one of the largest sturgeon EVER caught in the Fraser River. In our last fishing report, we mentioned a group of die-hard sturgeon fishermen from our tour operator in Denmark, Atlantik Travel www.atlantiktravel.com This group - on their last day - wrote a piece of fishing history...  When the group arrived from Denmark last week, we were approached by the group leader and asked for a very patient guide, as 3 anglers in their group could neither hear nor speak. I replied to him, that all our guides are patient, as fishing is not a job, but a lifestyle for them. He looked around at all the guides present and into the room walked Kevin, a guide of few words. His nickname is ""The Fishwhisperer"" (thanks for the name, Carolyn Hansen). I said ""here is your guide, the 3 of you don`t talk, Kevin doesn`t either - perfect"". They hugged and up they went. I`ve learned, that, after every sturgeon they`ve landed, it was ""hugging time"" - approx. 20 times per day average. This was their way of saying ""thank you"". All guides, John, Steve and Kerry, did exceptionally well, landing lots of fish and lots of big fish, but the biggest smile was mostly with ""Asger Michaelsen"", ""Jornaa Pedersen"" and ""Bjarne Toft Loholt"".  It was in the afternoon, as Kevin called me on my speaker phone: ""we just hooked a big one"" ... ""OK"", I replied, ""how big?"" ... ""big..."" (remember, a man of few words). That`s as much information as I could get out of him. Knowing Kevin, I knew, that`s a serious fish. Almost 3 hours later, Kevin called again with the stunning news; The Sturgeon has a total length of 329 cm or less than a fingertip short of 11 ft. with a girth of 136 cm, that`s over 4.5 ft. around. We estimate the fish at 120 years old with a realistic weight of 750 to 800 lbs. The sturgeon was measured, tagged, photos taken and released carefully and unharmed. The fish was hooked and fought by ""Asger Michaelsen"" for 2 hours and 53 minutes - all by himself without any help. Asger is a strong man, but this fish took his toll on him."
