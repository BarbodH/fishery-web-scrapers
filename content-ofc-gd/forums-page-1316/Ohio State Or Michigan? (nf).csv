1880,Gerritt,2006-11-18 20:19:00,6129,Seeing as how I am a huge Football fan... and college football is more entertaining then the NFL (fewer premadonnas) I just want to know where OFC'rs loyalties lay...  my vote is for the Wolverines!!! Go Mich Go!
1959,FISHEYEZ,2006-11-19 00:16:00,49,"I dont think so..... lol.... NOTHING is gonna get in Ohio States way.....please.......      i like ""blue"" too,   but man, State is  GOOD     the Big 10 IS GOOD.......who knows"
1961,Krisco,2006-11-19 00:19:00,67,"Was a great game anyway you slice it! Was hoping for a Mich win but it didn't work out, Bo would still be proud."
1962,Gerritt,2006-11-19 00:23:00,6129,it was a great game!!! wow!... I was bleeding blue... too bad it didnt go in their favor... I think it could have easily went either way..  Ahhh well...  And Yes RIP Bo.    Gerritt.
1971,TennesseeGuy,2006-11-19 00:39:00,957,Looks as though Michigan will stay number 2 in the national rankings.
1981,express168,2006-11-19 01:32:00,327,"Sad loss for Michigan but they still deserve the second national championship spot. They lost to #1 on the road by 3, they spanked Notre Dame earlier this season and USC lost to a much weaker team. That is my opinion but I think they will get screwed out of it and end up in the Rose Bowl. Either way a great game to watch today! Rest in Peace BO!"
1990,Whopper,2006-11-19 02:16:00,2174,Sorry Gerritt but all is good in Whopperville!  OSU 42 That Team up North 39  Buckeyes the Next National Champions!  Whopper
1994,tomO,2006-11-19 02:26:00,363,big ten and national champs plus a heisman trophy.
2056,Rizzo,2006-11-19 04:28:00,4754,all I saw was the first offensive series for each team...touchdowns for both.  Sounds like it was entertaining the whole way through
2114,steve_paul,2006-11-19 12:21:00,658,"Great game, sad to see the Wolverines lose though.  Hope there is a rematch for the championship too come Jan.  RIP Bo."
2128,fatdaddy,2006-11-19 13:23:00,19,"That was a classic of a game!     I have been a huge buckeyes fan since the days of eddie george, terry glenn and joey galloway!  I too would like to see a rematch in the BCS championship game, although if Rutgers wins out, I think they should go.  Michigan IMO is better than any other 1 loss team.  Rutgers is a HUGE surprise, but they beat Louisville a few weeks back, so they must be for ""real""."
2167,oxcowboy,2006-11-19 14:57:00,544,"by far the best game of the season, it lived up to all of the hype.  i agree that the team up north should get a rematch, but i dont think the powers that be will allow it for some crazy reason.  ohio state should have alot easier game for the championship.  Go Bucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2180,TennesseeGuy,2006-11-19 15:22:00,957,Rutgers met reality in Cincinnati last night against a so so University of Cincinnati team.  I appreciated the class of both teams yesterday in Columbus.   No wolfing.  No shucking and jiving.  Just great effort and team play by both teams.  I hope the Monday papers don't have any post game violence to report coming from Ann Arbor or Columbus.
2360,Whopper,2006-11-19 21:46:00,2174,I'll pose a question here. After hearing a lot of peoples opinions about how the Wolverines should get a rematch does that mean if Ohio State would have lost yesterday that the would have automaticly played for a national title?  IMHO don't thinks so.   Whopper   UC's win last night was huge for their program.
2734,OhioFisherman,2006-11-20 17:14:00,6623,"The only football I watch anymore OSU! As it turned out the pick four lottery winning number here that day was 4239, LOL the fix was in? Great game they kept it interesting!"
