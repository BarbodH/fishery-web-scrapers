2155,ccmtcanada,2006-11-19 14:36:00,7971,"I went to a website to post my picture of that Walleye I caught back in October. (http://www.ontarioanglerawards.com/Splash.cfm).  I had no idea, but they send a certificate in the mail....and I received it yesterday.  You can order extra cool things like pins and crests.  The money for these are used for studies, research and other conservation initiatives in the province of Ontario.  Here's a pic of the award....pretty spiffy!!!    For those interested, here's a pic of that 12.5 pounder....    Later everyone! Cliff"

2290,trapshooter,2006-11-19 18:27:00,1234,nice and nicer!  Way to go Cliff.
2303,Britmick,2006-11-19 18:55:00,29,"Great job Cliff, beautiful fish."
2339,Fisherpete,2006-11-19 20:54:00,1814,"I agree the OFAH angler awards  is a great program. It gives you targets to aim for every time out! I started in 2004, and got the Avid Angler award that year (Muskie, Pike, LM Bass, Perch & Carp). In 2005, I had 8 entries, but only 4 different species so no award. So far in 2006 I have 3 species, and SOOOOO MANY close calls (tons of 17"" and 17.5"" LM, need an 18"", and 28, 28.5 and 29"" pike, need 30""!) The certificates look great framed next to pics of the fish on the wall. Here's one of the walls in my fishing room (yes, I have a fishing room lmao!)... featuring the 45"" Muskie I had done at Advanced Taxidermy    The rest of the certificates go next to the pics in the fishing photo album."

2604,ccmtcanada,2006-11-20 13:00:00,7971," Hey fisherpete!  Great idea for the certificates!! I think I'll hint for that kind of treatment for Christmas....great inexpensive gifts the kids can get me....hehe.  I'm not even close to the avid angler treatment, so congrats on that one!!  Hopefully I'll get out more next year....a full season of fishing.  I only started up again this past August.  Cliff"
2708,wuchikubo,2006-11-20 16:15:00,1114,Hey Cliff WTG!  With a start like that it'll be hard to put the fishing rod down again! LOL  Stan
2724,1leggedangler,2006-11-20 17:01:00,364,"Congrats Cliff,  That is a fish to be proud of for sure.  Cheers, 1leg"
