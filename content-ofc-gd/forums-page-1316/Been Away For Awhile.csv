Any fishing stories to tell?  I have had to change everything due to new computer And now I am trying out Linux too, has a few bugs but is alot better than Gates creation! (Windows Hubby's business is finally really taking off  Hope this finds all the people who have been suffering doing better And hope the families of troops are coping best wishes to them  I love this new LQQK very appealing to the eyes Alot easier to navigate too.....  And of course gotta love those smileys!  Lorissa/Daisy_girl58"
