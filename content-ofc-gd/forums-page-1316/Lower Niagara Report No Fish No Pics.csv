Well after the drizzle and wind at the end of last week the clarity of the water was terrible.  Saturday afternoon was tough and most peeps we ran into said they weren't having luck.  We drifted with roe all around queenston without a sniff.  beauty afternoon, not to cool, Water was clearing.  Sunday afternoon and monday should be better days for anyone going down.  I think the boat is going away for the winter now so this is my last open water report.  Looking forward to posting some ice fishing trips.  Ciao  Greg"
2501,Rizzo,2006-11-20 02:36:00,4754,no no no...you can't go out on a last day like that.  Hold off on the winterizing and give it one more shot.
