1891,Chris,2006-11-18 20:50:00,405,"Hi, I see there are some dog lovers on the board. Loved the ""look-a-like"" pics of Lew's dog Marvin. Here's a few pics of ""Lilly"" the little dog we got for our daughter Caroline this past June. She was pretty small for her first bath but looks pretty comical soaking wet.     Lilly's hair just kept on growing until she looked like a dust mop.   Finally after a visit to the barber... "

1912,Rich Clemens,2006-11-18 22:02:00,3131,"Here's a few of our girls.  They go with us on all our fishing trips and just love it.  They are both very good in the boat as well .... until someone gets a fish on, then everyone is hanging over the side of the boat.  The Airedale is 6 years old and the Lab is 1 year old.      "

Here he is at 9 months...    His fishing moment occurred at Lake Scugog....he was walking backwards....right off the boat landing and into the lake!!! My 4 year old laughed silly for over 20 minutes, while the poor dog shivered!!!"
