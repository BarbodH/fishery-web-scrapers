1973,TennesseeGuy,2006-11-19 01:01:00,957,"That's a chubby pike.  The guy holding her hasn't slept on my floor, but he's eaten plenty of my walleyes.  I fried two limits of four and my meal was the two little ones.  That net couldn't belong to you two.  Looks like something a guy from the U.S. would use."
1987,PatB,2006-11-19 01:52:00,104,"Nice report Raf, sweet pike."
1999,Daplumma,2006-11-19 02:30:00,1961,"Good job Raf and JP.Very hardcore fishermen,the both of you. Joe"
261,Raf,2006-11-16 13:31:00,3495,"Nothing unusual here but after a mild week, the weekend brought another cooling trend. Saturday featured high winds with light rain turning to light snow in the afternoon. Sunday was cool as well but we stayed dry and the winds had died down to only about 5km/hr. In fact, with very little boat traffic, it was a very nice cool November day on the water.  Water temps were in the mid 40s. The game plan was to cover a ton of water, find some activity and fish it hard. That meant a lot of trolling with a little bit of casting thrown in. We ran our baits in 10' and we ran them in 100'. Covered miles and were finally rewarded with a nice pike.  Remember this guy??    Nice goin' bud.  I'll let him tell you about the lure right here (click me).  36"" and a little chubby, the fish made a good account of itself. Judging by the head shakes when it was first hooked, we though we had a 'ski."
