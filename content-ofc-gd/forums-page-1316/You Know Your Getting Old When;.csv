Last year one of the guys had developed Parkisan desease so we had to carry all his stuff into the lakes for him. This year  of the other two , one has had a heart attack and the other has to have a hip transplant. I guess this year Ill have to carry everything or maybe Ill just take them to Wasaga Beach."

2286,TennesseeGuy,2006-11-19 18:21:00,957,Back in 1962 I was coaching/teaching in a H.S. in Ohio when my wife and I put together a fishing trip to the Chapleau area that included two other teachers and 5 students.  This past May I was still hobbled from a couple of back surgeries and there was no way I could make the 1445 miles north for a fishing trip without help.  One of the students from 1962 and his buddy put me flat on my back in the second seat of their pickup truck and hauled me round trip for 9 days of catching.  Work some young bloods into your fishing parties for when you get on down the road in life.  It paid off for me.
2330,Smokey,2006-11-19 20:06:00,1278,"Speaking of getting old Eddy, I think there's a guy in the family turning the big 60 soon. Like very soon.  "
