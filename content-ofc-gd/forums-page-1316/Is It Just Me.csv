1870,bigfish1965,2006-11-18 19:42:00,3382,Is it just me...or does it seem like it has rained every day since Labour Day? I cannot recall a wetter autumn that this one. Still got leaves in the yard and cannot clean them up cause everything is too wet...

I think I heard that Lake Superior is at an 80 year low, and all of its tribs have been reduced to a trickle. And there's concern about lack of well water this winter. Not good..."
2063,bigfish1965,2006-11-19 04:37:00,3382,Dan I have had standing water in my yard since mid-September. This end is getting lots.

Low rainfall this summer, along with low precipitation levels over the past few months has led to the city receiving only half the precipitation it normally does.  Rural water users dependent on wells are especially at risk, and are asked to begin conservation efforts now.  As well, the Water Response team is asking all users to lower their consumption by as much as 20 per cent to head off any further problems this spring.  Another indication of just how serious the problem is, Lake Superior is at it's lowest level in over 80 years."
