2631,dsn,2006-11-20 14:09:00,1018,I was just wandering if there's any Ice fishing seminars going to be on this season. Just as a past time thingy while waiting for the weather to get colder.  Something to do. I know they had some in the past.  dsn

Very well known angler on lake Simcoe. Last years event was a huge success.  It had great info, draw prizes and some great deals on ice fishing gear.  get there early for a seat at the seminars as it filled up quickly unless you don't mind standing."
