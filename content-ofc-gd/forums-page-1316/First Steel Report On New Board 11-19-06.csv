Kept 20"" for the pan, lost a bunch, released both.  nice buck   PB 29"" female   wicked day to be out and about fishing for trout."

Really nice fish, but does anyone else think that the background thing is getting out of hand? I know if I catch a trout Im gonna post the picture with the background. Hell Ill even tell you where I caught it, because the Oshawa Creek isnt exactly a secret.  Unless you fish a small, or relativley unknown trib, in which case disregard all above."
