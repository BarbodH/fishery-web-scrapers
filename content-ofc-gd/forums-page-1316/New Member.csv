1277,tonyb,2006-11-17 16:56:00,1637,"Welcome needtofish  I am in Burlington, shoot me a PM if you want to get out fishing sometime.  Also, keep an eye out for the OFC Christmas Swill that should be taking place near the end of December.  If you can make it out to that you should be able to put some faces to names from some of the fish-a-holics from here.  Tony"
