After a brief chat with him we headed into Picton for a shot a some night fishing off the public launch.  Unfortunately John was unable to bring his boat so we were stuck to shoreline fishing. Fished until 4:45 am with only a few little nibbles that were likely very small perch, no takers (nothing landed). Took a quick nap in the car, woke up at 6 am to the lights and sounds of the boat launch lineup! Headed back to Merland to see if we could meet up with some more OFNers. Met Terry and Icefisherman (who seemed a bit under the gun) as he was trying to get out onto the water as he had only a little time left (I would have liked to join him but he only had space for only one other guy   and we were two).  Wayne, I waited a few minutes as Terry thought you had just woke up. But my friend John was itching to catch something before we headed back home. So I asked Terry to say, ""hi"" for me and we headed to the Glenora Ferry docks. After fishing to just after 1 pm. we called it quits with 4 bite offs and only a bunch of perch to show for the outing. Throughout the morning, we saw some of the boats trolling past us further out, including Icefisherman going solo.  Anyways, thanks for the opportunity to meet some of you! Hopefully, the next time out I'll be able to get out earlier and meet a few more OFNers and to catch a 10+ lber 'eye which is still eluding me.  I'll have to get out to meet some more OFNers at the x-mas swill. Is there a date and time set yet?  Stan"
