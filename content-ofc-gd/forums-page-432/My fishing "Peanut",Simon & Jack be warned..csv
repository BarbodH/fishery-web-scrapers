675157,irishfield,2012-03-12 02:08:00,26272,What a great shot with the dog standing guard!!! Reminds me of our old Lab that did the same with kids.. no training required!  She's a keeper... that's for sure!

675180,wormdunker,2012-03-12 03:12:00,1711,She's a keeper!  I remember taking my 2 daughters on the ice when they were 8 & 10.  They're now 38 and 35.  Memories is what its all about.

675247,limeyangler,2012-03-12 13:47:00,5204,"Awesome Rick!  Cutie for sure! The minnow bucket is also a non stop source of entertainment for Jack too.  I think Jack will have to be careful of her, she looks taller than him already!!!!"
675251,bigugli,2012-03-12 13:54:00,6138,That way she'll keep Jack in line
