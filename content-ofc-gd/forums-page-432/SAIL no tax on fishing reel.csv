674098,Wolf 3,2012-03-08 02:54:00,134,Friday March 5? Just kidding. Thanks for the notice.
674100,captpierre,2012-03-08 03:02:00,2521,just reels?
674101,2jack2,2012-03-08 03:02:00,92,"Sorry, March 9 Friday,"
674104,2jack2,2012-03-08 03:08:00,92,"Their regular VIP sale will start much later in March, which is no tax on everything in the store with some exception. March  9 - March 14 is just for reel."
674240,mugsmuffin,2012-03-08 16:23:00,17,I found that Gagnons in Oshawa was at least 10 to 20 percent cheaper than Sail on pretty well any thing to do with fishing
674448,2jack2,2012-03-09 03:16:00,92,"Update on the no tax sale, they have no tax on all fishing products, with the only exception on electonic. I dont know about Gagnon's pricing, never been in there before. Comsumer have their choice where to shop, I just past on the information."
674475,boombap,2012-03-09 05:35:00,310, On ALL fishing products huh? May be getting myself a new rod and reel
674486,MCTFisher9120,2012-03-09 11:24:00,3761, Ahh should of come in last month...20% off everything all month it was.
674804,skeeter99,2012-03-10 12:59:00,109,  LOL  that is great you will get 15% off and item that is 20% to 25% overpriced compared to any local shop  sounds like a great deal
675004,Weeds,2012-03-11 04:44:00,782,Cut the original poster some slack. He was most likely trying to do you a favour. I'll bet theres at least a few bargains to be found.
675006,registerfly,2012-03-11 05:23:00,198," kinda blanket statement don't you think? Have you ever purchased anything from there? There prices are on par with items I have seen at other shops, and cheaper in some cases. I saved over $300 on my shotgun there.  And if like some of us that live in the west end, it sure beats driving 80 clicks to Gagnon. I shop at Gagnon and took advantage of last months' 20% off, but be realistic, almost 200km for a round trip is fiscally irresponsible, at least for me. I'm just grateful we have options!"
