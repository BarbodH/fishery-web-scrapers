672191,Lip-ripper,2012-03-02 15:21:00,228,"From someone who's been there, keep up your strength by making sure you eat even if you lose your appetite and eat healthy. A positive outlook is also one of the most important things. Picture being out on your favorite lake trolling around or on your favorite river casting if you need a mental break. I used Lake Temagami as it was one of the lakes I grew up fishing. A fellow survivor I spoke to once told me that whenever they were receiving treatment, they pictured a little mouse inside their body, eating the bad cells, and it really helped them. Kick it's butt SBK!"
