Lots of fresh stealhead ready and willing to play...5/9 was the score today...lost couple large fish but oh well still got to fight them so it all counts ;-)  Almost dropped my cell phone in the water while taking one of the shots... I smell a lot of nice fishing days coming soon with this beautiful weather in the background...    Here are the photos for your viewing pleasure:                    Cheers,  Ice Fisherman"
