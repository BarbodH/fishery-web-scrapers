674910,peter23,2012-03-10 19:21:00,95,"going to be getting ready for spingtime crappie as well as panfish, just wondering what line you use for them? name, pound test, briad mono fluoro? any help?  thanks"
674912,Billy Bob,2012-03-10 19:37:00,5865,"Any name brand #4 mono....like Triline XL or Stren or Cabela's Proline that I have been using for about 15-18 years now without any issues....just keep it simple with small 1/32 jigs and a small slip bobber or I just use a small foam cigar bobber. Catch lots of crappie, bluegills and pumpkin seeds....all good eats. Oh, a longer 6.5' or 7' rod really helps you cast that light stuff, especially on those windy days....short rods are not good for this kind of fishing.  Have Fun, Bob"
674989,Joeytier,2012-03-11 02:22:00,3990,4 lb Trilene XL...The only line you'll ever need for pannies.  Don't let anyone tell ya you need that fancy stuff...
675015,crappieperchhunter,2012-03-11 08:53:00,2582,X2...it's all I have used for years. I like the green line myself.
675017,Handlebarz,2012-03-11 12:06:00,3790,I had always liked the 4lbs magnathin or Stren 2-4lbs
675041,Sinker,2012-03-11 15:42:00,8692,"I'm kinda partial to the P-line Fluoroclear. Its a combo of mono coated in fluoro. Same qualities as mono, only more abrasion resistant.  I haven't had any issues with it so far.  I use 2-4lb myself on a 7' ultralight.  S."
