674921,vinnimon,2012-03-10 20:58:00,2593,"i have an abu ambassador 5501c3 on it so far and its getting tired,. I do like the balance but I feel the reel is a little small for my likings. Esp targeting skis.  Replacing the reel with the same model would be ideal since i will have spare parts for it, but like I said i think the reel is a little small for those big feirce fish. I also dont want to be braking the bank either. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated Thanks in advance  v"
674926,Handlebarz,2012-03-10 21:17:00,3790,I like my Abu big game 7000 I picked it up last summer for $149 in the US I still have my old 7000 but like the new one better it has off set gears and power handle.  The 7000's are bigger then you 5501.
674930,Pigeontroller,2012-03-10 21:38:00,2793,"Vince, what do you plan on doing with it? Is it an all-around Muskie rod that you plan on casting and trolling with? Or is it technique specific, like to be used for Jerkbaits?"
674934,Roy,2012-03-10 21:52:00,13728,Dax has the right question. Can't help much without knowing that.
674958,vinnimon,2012-03-10 23:39:00,2593,"  Casting & possibly trolling, so an all round reel would be great."
674966,SlowPoke,2012-03-11 00:00:00,2984, The Calcutta 400B is a great duel purpose reel but might be a little more money than you'd like to part with.
674977,Pigeontroller,2012-03-11 01:02:00,2793,"Since you'll be trolling with it a clicker is a likely must have feature...A Calcutta 400B is good choice, as is a Daiwa Luna 300, both are over $200 though...But well worth the money. A St.Croix Avid AC300 is about $225, exact same as a discontinued Daiwa Millionaire CV-Z 300, which is a bombproof reel! And very similar to the Luna and Calcutta 400B. I'd suggest spending a bit more and never worrying about replacing it."

675088,Raf,2012-03-11 20:27:00,3495,"get a 6501 c3, it'll be a good all 'round reel without breaking the bank.  the clicker is loud and it's a solid reel."
