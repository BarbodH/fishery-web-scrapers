674857,solopaddler,2012-03-10 16:13:00,8605,"Picked up my new float rod yesterday and once again Spiel has outdone himself. It is truly a thing of beauty!  It's a 13' 2pc CTS blank rated 4-8lb.  Handle was built precisely to my spec's.  Wood components in the handle had an astounding amount of green in them when Chris had the block of wood turned down and I think it looks phenominal.  Old English bronze reel seat fittings match the wood perfectly I think.  At my request there are also two matching wood accents in both the fore and rear grip.  I requested an oversized version of a western fly rod grip for my foregrip. Chris turned the cork to perfection. There are some teeny flaws in the cork (really good fluoro grade cork is impossible to find), but beyond that, it's the nicest foregrip I've seen on a float rod.  Overall very subtle and classy, I love it.  I am so over the plethora of composite inserts most guys are putting on their handles these days.  That candy cane look is just so last year!    Guides are titanium frame Fuji SIC with dark brown main wraps and two subtle turns of metallic copper trim.  Everything blends together seamlessly.              Thanks buddy, you da man!"
674861,BillM,2012-03-10 16:19:00,17367,"Yup, I'll be making a few drifts with that rod shortly then probably ordering one.  Thanks Mike, for making me spend money!!!!!!!!"
674862,solopaddler,2012-03-10 16:22:00,8605,  That's my goal in life.  The plan is working to perfection.

674879,Big Cliff,2012-03-10 17:27:00,6899,"I have had the pleasure of seeing some of his custom work! he built a rod for me for a very special friend some years ago. Truly beautiful and functional creations.  While I do have two very beautiful custom rods that were given to me as gifts over the years I do not have one of his but someday, I will!"
674880,FUSION,2012-03-10 17:34:00,81,Rod turned out awsome bud! I would also recommend Mr. Spiel for anyone looking to have some rod work done. First class service all the way!
674882,corvette1,2012-03-10 17:38:00,1765,sweet looking rod mike. congrats to you chris awesome job
674895,Ralph Field,2012-03-10 18:25:00,1018,A beautiful rod made by a gifted rod maker.
674898,Big Cliff,2012-03-10 18:34:00,6899,And you know what makes them so special? There is a heart in every one of them!
674899,Spiel,2012-03-10 18:37:00,9065,"My thanks to all for the compliments..  It's always a pleasure for me to meet the requirements of my customers and have them pleased with the end results.  I see it didn't take you long Mike to get the line through the guides for it's maiden run tomorrow, I hope it exceeds all your expectations."
674908,Roy,2012-03-10 19:12:00,13728,"I remember the first rod Spiel made for me. It took me a while to match a reel to it. I really didn't think any reel was worthy and that's a fact. It finally came down to a Calcutta 700 and it's just a perfect muskie trolling combo. Now my planning is a little better so the rods he's crafted since, already had a reel waiting for them. I'll be asking Spiel in the next week or so for another."
674913,misfish,2012-03-10 19:53:00,29133,Sweet piece of work there Chris.   Your going to stop and pick me up right? So I can get some on the job training.
674917,solopaddler,2012-03-10 20:30:00,8605,"  Or we can head out together without Bill, he's a pain in the   anyway.   "
674923,esoxansteel,2012-03-10 21:06:00,1307,"  Ah Mike if you think Bill's a pain in the  I guess theres no hope for me, theres no emoticons there to describe me thank god, BTW the new CTS is gorgeous, and it has Speil's heart and soul into every creation of his. Wont take too many drifts to break her in the way the runs have been."
674925,solopaddler,2012-03-10 21:13:00,8605,"  Just kidding Steve, Bill's a great guy.  At some point we should definitely fish together!"

674971,Fish Farmer,2012-03-11 00:32:00,2234,"I must say, my Sheephead Rod he's making, surpasses anything he has made as of yet. What till you guys see the master piece. Only one in the world Till then Mike, yours is number one."
674973,Live2fish85,2012-03-11 00:49:00,1633,That thing looks awesome. I am going to have to get a rod made by Chris as well.  Spiel you do some awesome work that thing looks amazing.
