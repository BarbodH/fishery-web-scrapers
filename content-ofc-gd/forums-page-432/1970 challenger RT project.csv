674848,irishfield,2012-03-10 15:32:00,26272,"Wish I had pictures of half the stuff we did when we were young and foolish (and indestructible). I stuffed a 318 into the nose of my brother's Volkswagon when he was at University... 9"" Ford rear end. I was 14/15 at the time and he was none toooo happy upon his return that summer. I thought I was doing him a favour getting rid of that air cooled thing that never worked.. lol  We put a 302 in a pinto, while Jeff's Mother was off on a one week vacation.. with some preplanning / part gathering before she left. 426 hemi in our 1969 Fury II family car when my sister and I took it over from the parents. Made some good money with that sleeper on Carling Ave in Ottawa. 429 in a 70 Mustang, 392 Hemi in a Duster. Then you get older and spend 5 times the money putting everything back to get your concours car back in one piece.. as was the case with my '69 Superbee. #'s matching car, but who cared when you were 18/19 throwing out the bench seat because you wanted it to look cool with buckets. Toss away the original rims for some cool CTC mags and wide tires. In my late 20's I spent a fortune trying to find the original bench seat going junk yard to junk yard, to return it to stock and many other parts that had been removed for the cool factor. Still haven't found the original 14"" wheels.  Oh.. and Liverelease.. Billy's already seen my bird!!"

675273,addy79,2012-03-12 15:16:00,573,nice project!  My Dad's restoring his '69 Roadrunner. Is that an E body?? If so I can relay the message and see if he's looking for parts.  Is that a 383 in the Challenger??
675286,cuzza,2012-03-12 16:06:00,467," I saw that too - looks like a Murcielago   Some very nice Italian toys in that shop, 360 Spider, couple of Integrales and a very pretty Alfa  Looks like a great project Jose, look forward to the pics when it's done"
675301,e-z-out,2012-03-12 16:51:00,1052,Sorry that's a 440 in the challenger  Yes that's a police interceptor. its a 2006 murcie. Lots of toys at the shop right now trying to push them out before we get busy again.
674446,irishfield,2012-03-09 03:09:00,26272,I don't even plate them anymore Bill... as we're gone all summer. I know.. another waste!

674459,Cudz,2012-03-09 03:35:00,2652,"my question is this. WHy not keep the car numbers matching and if you don't want it, sell it for $50 - $60k plus and then go out and buy a slighly more worn 318 car and do the mod on that one.  Just makes no sense to me.  I must be missing something here."

674497,DanD,2012-03-09 12:38:00,2223," Are you willing to sell the LS1; if so how much? I have a customer that might be interested in it for his 64 Impala. The car has already had a drivetrain swop; so stuffing one of these in would bring back some of its value. We’ve installed a LS1 in an 87 Mazda RX7 with a manual six speed. The car was originally turbo charged, which meant it came factory with a 4:10 posi differential. Talk about the best of both worlds; low 11’s with shinny (No traction) 60 series street tires and then approx 35 miles to the gallon, doing a buck 20 on the 401. We haven’t found what the top end is yet; but at 280Kph in 5th gear, we pulled the foot out of the throttle. This year there’s a cam, 6lt heads and some valvetrain work to be done; which should take us up another 100hp. After that the roll cage and some body mods, so we can stuff some decent rubber under her. The most common remark we hear from people is “that don’t sound like no rotary”. LOL It's still an ugly duckling now; but wanting to finish off the power train and then cosmetics. Trying to keep her looking as stock as possible; the factory hood closes right on top of the LS1. Don't want too many knowing what’s pushing her down the road, not until the right time anyway.  Dan.  "
674503,grimsbylander,2012-03-09 13:11:00,3016, LOL I'm sure there's some road rash he's not telling us about.
674531,Raf,2012-03-09 15:38:00,3495," Although it does make me cry a little (I love the FC and FD Turbo RX7s), that's very cool too DanD.  I suppose it's a drag car -- I'm saying that because stuffing the ls1 would likely ruin weight distribution for road course and add a few pounds on top of it?"
674538,BITEME,2012-03-09 15:49:00,1968,  Impala fitting name it should be impailed  MOPAR ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

674575,DanD,2012-03-09 18:09:00,2223," You’d be very surprised at how well the car candles a road track; this little car just loves the extra weight of the all aluminum V8 and the power; well if a car could smile it be from headlight too headlight. Also with the engine almost back touching the firewall and the length of the six speed; the front to rear weight distribution is pretty good. Looking at the rake of the car, other then a bit lower (2-2.5 inch front and rear) it looks stock. All I know is stick her nose deep into a corner from the outside and plant your boot; she just squats and grabs for asphalt with very little push, too correct for.  Dan."
674585,RSF,2012-03-09 18:32:00,47,"I see there are suspension mods. Was it originally torsion bar? Worked for chrysler when younger and a mechanic friend of mine had a Duster 440, traction was always a problem but it sizzled on the highway.  Challengers were hard to find new back then. Seems after Vanishing Point came out in the theatres the cars could'nt be made fast enough in the sense of availability. I liked the old Charger and Super Bee too."
674587,Bernie,2012-03-09 18:36:00,3190,"Hi Dan. Going to keep it. It's still in a car, running. The car is pretty rusted, but it runs real strong.  Wish I had of kept my 83 Grand Prix. Would have made it a real fun car."
674655,DanD,2012-03-09 22:08:00,2223,"Bernie I hear yea, I’m not that much of a wheeler dealer myself; when I get something I like, I hang on to it, just in case. If by chance you do find something to put that drive train in and you need the PCM tweaked, let me know. My Son is getting the software, so that he can go in and change programming of the PCM; rather than just dealing with GM’s per-written parameters. If you want a different timing curve, more fuel, less fuel, turning certain emissions devices off (not that we’d do that); this software should do this. It cost us a couple hundred for a guy to do this for us on the Mazda/LS1 and now that we’re adding a few more ponies, it’ll need changing again. With our own software we’ll be able to tailor programming to the car’s needs, while on the road or dyno and our foot into the throttle, while under load. Just ask an we’ll deal with logistics and of course it’ll be on an OFC/OFC deal. Sorry for the hijack and going back to the thread; that MOPAR; is going to turn some heads for sure. Just the thought of the snake pushing that vintage down the road warrants an acknowledgment of respect. Dan."
674673,jedimaster,2012-03-09 23:53:00,3472,I jammed a 400 stump puller into a 1991 plymouth acclaim then chopped it into a 2 door pickup elcamino style... I wish I had pics of it. The only one I have is one from part way through the project....

674400,e-z-out,2012-03-09 01:44:00,1052,So here is my winter Project a 1970 Dodge Challenger RT From Mint to stripped lol  Dropping a 2008 Dodge Viper motor with full suspension.  Here are a few pics of what has been done so far i know its not much but its a start. will post more as the project continues. I still need to strip down the full interior that is in mint shape. It kills me to strip this beutiful car but the build will be crazy once its done.                            By the way if anyone knows anyone looking for parts for a E body Dodge let me know i will be selling lots of parts.
674405,irishfield,2012-03-09 01:54:00,26272,That would be E Body parts...  And all I can say is WHY Jose.. WHY... please put it back together.. don't do a resto mod...
674407,misfish,2012-03-09 01:54:00,29133,Im drooling. A viper? Thats so sick and nasty.

674414,e-z-out,2012-03-09 02:05:00,1052,  Sorry Wayne your right E body The funny thing is the motor only has 2000 miles on it and we decided to do this project.  We have a few other Projects that will fallow after this one that i might post
674415,GBW,2012-03-09 02:06:00,8460,There is a tear in my beer looking at this post...
674416,e-z-out,2012-03-09 02:07:00,1052,  Roy why have toys if you cant play with them lol. We all like custom rods and reels why not custom hot wheels

674421,irishfield,2012-03-09 02:17:00,26272,At least tell me it wasn't a numbers match drive train... and I'll feel a little better! lol  It's yours Jose.. you do what every you want with the baby. Hard to find an E body in Canada in that nice of shape after 42 years! My 'birds that clean underneath.. but my 'bee is not.
674424,e-z-out,2012-03-09 02:21:00,1052, Sorry to brake your heart Wayne she is all matching numbers.  Soon she will be all apart and sent off to the frame shop for cutting.  Need to cut the firewall and part of the floor to fit the viper motor.
674425,Bernie,2012-03-09 02:22:00,3190,Looks like fun Jose. Do you have all the wiring harnesses and computers to go along with the V10? How do you plan to hook up the speedometer and other things that do not match?  I have a nice GM complete LS1 powertrain. Just waiting for something to put it in.
674427,Roy,2012-03-09 02:24:00,13728,"And just in case anyone missed that, let me repeat it. Wayne's bird is clean underneath."
674428,e-z-out,2012-03-09 02:27:00,1052,  We have just about everything we need for now. We have a custom dash on order and all the gauges as well. All custom wiring will be made as needed.

674434,Pigeontroller,2012-03-09 02:30:00,2793,I didn't even know Wayne had a bird?!
674435,irishfield,2012-03-09 02:30:00,26272, I spent the night in Niagara Falls.. trust me it's totally clean!
674436,e-z-out,2012-03-09 02:32:00,1052,  Thats from the first time it was restored about a year ago. $45k was spent the first time. This time around i think we are going to hit the $60K mark  Sorry wayne it's not mine if she was i would never do that to her.
674437,HTHM,2012-03-09 02:34:00,4082,"Gasp, how could you do that! But hey it is up to the owner to do as seen fit....."

Such a pitty."
674442,Tybo,2012-03-09 02:55:00,1373,There guy`s out their that will destroy a beautiful 63 Impala`s to try and make them look pretty. So it would only be a improvement from the Chrysler stable.
