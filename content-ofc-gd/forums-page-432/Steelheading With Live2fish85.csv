Today I had the opportunity to meet and fish with him for the first time, and while the catching wasn't so great, the fishing sure was a lot of fun. It was just a gorgeous day out there today!  He's a fine young man and I'm very glad to see he's on the road to recovery with such a young family at home relying on him.  I'll be looking forward to getting out with you again bud!  We put a few miles on the truck today in search of fish and was very glad to see Chris pull one out in the bottom of the 9th with this silver beauty. Well done!   "
