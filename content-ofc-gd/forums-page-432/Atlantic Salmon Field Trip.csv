First, the background...  My daughter school is involved with the Bring Back the Salmom program. Their school had a hatchery supplied by the OFAH (a special temperature controlled fish tank). In this tank they had 100 fertilized Atlantic salmon eggs. The eggs hatched and the students recorded the progress. My daughters school has 95 of 100 eggs hatch which was an excellent ratio. When the fry get to be about 1"" long they took the fish to a designated creek and the students get to release them.  This is where the field trip come in....  We were meet at the school by a OFAH volunteer. They loaded up the fry and lead us to a small creek that is part of the headwaters of Cobourg Creek. This area was identified as a historical Atlantic salmon creek. It has been rehabilitated to create the perfect conditions for the salmon.  The salmon nursery!   Each student got to name and release a salmon fry. My daughter named her's Sarah. The OFAH rep then explained the life cycle of the Atlantic salmon. He showed the class a variety of water bugs that the small fish would be feeding on for the next 2 years. He was an excellent presenter and talked to the kids at a level they would understand.  Here's my oldest helping my youngest to release her salmon.   My daughter holding fresh water shrimp   Things I learned:  - it takes 4 years for an Atlantic salmon to mature and return to the creek to spawn - the program is 5 years old and they are starting to see salmon return to spawn - Atlantic salmon are multiple spawners. They don't die after spawning, they will return for several years. - People are starting to catch Atlantic salmon in Lake Ontario. - I was surprised how much life (small insects) were in this small fast moving stream!  I know there is some controversy with this program and I don't have the knowledge to wade into that debate. All I know is that this program has an excellent education section. The kids loved hatching and raising the salmon. My daughter loved the field trip and still talks about the stuff she learned.  It sounds like the Atlantic salmon are starting to take hold and that this program may be able to create a self sustaining population. I think it's worth a try!"
