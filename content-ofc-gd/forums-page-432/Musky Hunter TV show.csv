671339,Snidley,2012-02-29 16:44:00,620,Bob I noticed that you use Otter boards. I've heard about them and they look like thewy track well. What are your thoughts on them vs other boards?
671343,BillM,2012-02-29 16:46:00,17367,Am I the only one that read Jims reply heard him inside my head at the same time?  LOL!
671367,mike rousseau,2012-02-29 17:19:00,4661,"  i could hear him right where his posts reads...""a musky is a musky""...lol"
671542,Bob Devine,2012-02-29 21:54:00,251," I like the way the Otters track and they store beside my seats without scratching the fibreglass on my boat. I have used others, wood ones could scratch with the bolts and rods they are made with. Large molded boards did not seem to track well or were too long to store. I was happy with the performance and storage of the Otters and have used them for about 11 years."
671573,Pigeontroller,2012-02-29 22:54:00,2793,Jim will be at the Niagara Outdoor Show this Friday and Saturday!  http://niagaraoutdoorsportsandboatshow.com/
671674,darsky,2012-03-01 02:27:00,586,"MH's best shows are when he is fishing with Lazarus. That dh'er with 2 50's a few season's back was quite memorable. And then there was...... "" Jim the 45""er on this side is nice but the one you got on there could eat this one...."""
671961,Jim Saric,2012-03-01 23:58:00,2,Looking forward to Niagara tomorrow.  Love filming with Mike Lazarus.  He is full of incredible one liners.    Of course he's also a great fisherman.
671963,Roy,2012-03-02 00:01:00,13728,"In my opinion, Mike and Marc are probably the two best muskie minds there are."
672148,darsky,2012-03-02 13:34:00,586,"Roy- "" Probably "" ?????????"
675137,scugpg,2012-03-12 01:14:00,1373,Looks like the preview is out for this Friday's upcoming episode with Bob and Jim again on LSC  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmb23OyrEvY
668700,scugpg,2012-02-22 01:07:00,1373,"I've been enjoying the new season of Musky Hunter this year on WFN. Did anyone else have a chance to see the episode they filmed in the Kawarthas a few weeks back? It was neat to see them cover that area. Also saw that Bob Devine will be in the one this coming weekend filmed on LSC which should be cool to see.  For the guys that went to the Toronto show, how was the seminar Jim put on? I hope to catch it next time around."
668791,Gman,2012-02-22 12:35:00,126,Should be a great show!  Cheers G.
668800,DoubleDigits,2012-02-22 13:02:00,140," I saw the episode, and it was cool to see. I had always wondered if he would come to the Kawarthas."
668858,glen,2012-02-22 16:29:00,2641,can we see it online?
668928,Gregoire,2012-02-22 19:42:00,1397,"I beleive you can watch Musky Hunter episodes on-line for a fee. I think it is something like 2.99$. As far as the seminar at the show, it was pretty good, but dominated by Gord Pyzer, who shared a lot of useful information with the crowd."
669199,Bob Devine,2012-02-23 19:10:00,251,"I was at the seminar and found it informative. Great to see a very good cause and all those involved to make it happen, from Andy and Vita to all the volunteers."
669322,bucktail,2012-02-24 00:41:00,1857,I saw it too and kept lookin for Lew!!
669335,scugpg,2012-02-24 01:13:00,1373, They have clips on their Youtube channel but don't think they have full episodes  Kawarthas http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUhQT39ybH8  LSC with Bob http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zG4t3AnlT2c
669750,scugpg,2012-02-25 02:44:00,1373,Great episode tonight Bob!
670812,scugpg,2012-02-28 16:45:00,1373,The LSC/Windsor episode is on again tonight at 7:30 on WFN for those who want to see it.
670836,bassjnkie,2012-02-28 17:06:00,1101,Kawartha episodes where great. Learned alot more that I knew about the techniques/lakes.
670872,Snidley,2012-02-28 17:47:00,620,"I was surprised that while trolling St Clair there was not more emphasis on the specialty lures that are so key to success there. They did show two specialty St Clair lures but the key there are Producers, Woodies, Gotcha's, Fingerlings and Lokes. I guess they were using the Joe Bucher's that sponsor the show but the guys I know that work St Clair wouldn't give those Bucher lures any face time."
670888,Roy,2012-02-28 18:24:00,13728,"We may be getting some ""inside info"" as Jim Saric is one our newest members."
670910,Bob Devine,2012-02-28 18:58:00,251,"We trolled a number of ""local"" baits and the Shallow Raiders. They all caught fish, but one ""local"" bait did better getting  5 of the 9 bites we had during that day of filming. Yes it was all done on 1 day from about 10am-430pm. As was mentioned in the show there was a front circling the great lakes and we had a little bit of, sun, wind and rain."
670911,DoubleDigits,2012-02-28 19:01:00,140, Very cool. He puts out one of the best fishing shows out there
670932,Snidley,2012-02-28 20:14:00,620,Last time I was there we got 9 fish in the morning from 9am till about 1pm. Frankies were in the lure mix as well. Some very nice fish too. Truly a superior fishery. I've heard that there are approximately 50K Muskies in Lake St Clair. I guess how big those Muskies are is fairly important as well.
671001,Handlebarz,2012-02-28 23:14:00,3790,Im looking forward to the show tonight looks like it will be a good one.
671038,Handlebarz,2012-02-29 00:32:00,3790,Just starting now get off OFC and in front of the tv
671047,Jim Saric,2012-02-29 00:54:00,2,"Glad you like the show.   I had a lot of fun filming the Ontario episodes.  The Kawarthas reminded me of stepping back in time in WI ten years.  The lakes were beautiful, but we didn't have to deal with all the fishing pressure.   The show with Bob on St. Clair was a blast as well.  I have fished St. Clair off and on for years and like everywhere else there are ""favorite lures"".   However, a musky is a musky, and you can catch muskies on almost any lure on St. Clair.   Like Bob indicated, we fished mostly ""local"" baits the first day and were fortunate to get a great show.  So, on day 2 we decided to run Depthraiders and caught a bunch more and filmed a second show.   That episode will air in mid-March.  There were some questions about the episodes being available for download.  We make each episode available saturday morning and the cost is $2.99 (us) to download the episode.  Finally, hope to see some of you friday and saturday at the Niagara Outdoor Sports and Boat show this weekend.  I'll keep checking in when I can.  thanks and keep watching.  Jim  "
671049,Handlebarz,2012-02-29 01:01:00,3790,Great show guys congrats on the fatty
671051,Muskieman,2012-02-29 01:03:00,2472,Great stuff.. !
671053,mike rousseau,2012-02-29 01:06:00,4661,cool show...  that open water trolling is where its at...  i wish i could wet my lines and drive all day... river musky fishing is a lot more run and gun...  hey Bob... what kinda rods and line are you running?
671066,Roy,2012-02-29 01:44:00,13728,"Thank you for your post Jim and thanks for registering. You have fans here too.  And you're right about muskies, (and most other fish) if it moves, it's food."
671074,Bob Devine,2012-02-29 02:20:00,251,"  Thanks Mike and others, you never know when you are going to catch a ""big"" fish and you want it to come at the right time. This one did! I prefished for 2 days before the shoot and we could not break 40"". As you can tell it all worked out with a mix of fish from 32""-??"" lol."
671078,Handlebarz,2012-02-29 02:23:00,3790,Bob your right about not knowing what the next one will be that is what keeps us coming back time and time again it's also the reason I have a bunch of rainbow gear still in the BPS bag from 4 years ago I can't get away from them toothy critters
