674324,tightline,2012-03-08 23:31:00,322,Was thinking of heading to Dunnville on Sunday due to super sweet weather and an Itch I haven't been able to quite scratch.  Any chance for some Cats out there in this weather or not worth the drive from Guelph?
674326,uglyfish,2012-03-08 23:35:00,981,"call fishmasters bait and tackle. he'll tell ya. with the warm weather we've had, u may find some in there. theres always some in there. but i dont think you'll get into a lot of them and not likely to see anything big."
674329,tightline,2012-03-08 23:39:00,322,"Yeah I know about fishmasters and will call in the morning, the way I see it is sittin around in the sunshine with a line in the drink, gonna be the best Sunday of 2012 so far."
674354,Frank,2012-03-09 00:31:00,74," Might see ya there, i've been itching to get out for Cats at the Grand."
674432,Steve Piggott,2012-03-09 02:28:00,196,Water is sill cold 37 F. When the water get in the mid forty's to fifty is a good time to start chasing cats. Here is were you find the tmps in the grand http://www.grandriver.ca/index/document.cfm?Sec=2&Sub1=7&Sub2=1
674501,Fish4Eyes,2012-03-09 13:09:00,1022,"Based on trends in past years, they should start turning on in 2-3 weeks. Wouldn't be suprised if it came earlier this year with the mild temps we've been having on and off."
674513,Frank,2012-03-09 13:59:00,74, Thanks for the link Steve.
674928,Fishmaster,2012-03-10 21:37:00,920,Dont depend on that link the readings are from way up river and the 37 temp was taken thursday with my prob.I will be out allday tommrow will let ya know whats going on .my guess is they are starting .Fishmaster
674940,Frank,2012-03-10 22:12:00,74,"Thanks Steve, ...I might go giv'r a shot tomorrow too. That is if you have dew worms for sale at you're shop?"
675008,tightline,2012-03-11 05:40:00,322,"Called him today, and hes opening the shop doors tomorrow...no cutbait yet but I would bet he has worms.  Anybody tried to do any pike or walleye fishing in southern Ontario?  Never had the oppertunity really to do much river fishing this time of year? Curious as to how to go about finding pike in these conditions."
675009,fishing,2012-03-11 06:06:00,167,"Walleye and pike were/are biting, but they may not be open? You can buy worms for sure."
675013,Bondar,2012-03-11 06:51:00,817,Lol here we go again
675023,tightline,2012-03-11 13:31:00,322,Walleye is open until March 15th and pike til the 30th in zone 16..there are some Grand River exceptions as always.  But it sounds like some good possibilities are out there if you know where to look...Now where to look?
675032,Fishmaster,2012-03-11 15:24:00,920,Walleye and Pike are closed on the grand river ...last day of Feb
675221,tightline,2012-03-12 12:04:00,322," Only on your end...open from caledonia up there still open, with a few exceptions."
675223,tightline,2012-03-12 12:06:00,322,Hey Fishmaster you said you were going out yesterday when we talked on the phone..any luck?
675226,Roy,2012-03-12 12:10:00,13728, Check out his thread a third of the way down this page.
675227,Fish4Eyes,2012-03-12 12:13:00,1022,"tightline: given where you live, you should not be asking about pike advice  check PM."
675229,tightline,2012-03-12 12:23:00,322, Thanks Roy dont know how I missed that
675230,Roy,2012-03-12 12:32:00,13728, Don't worry about it. You can still be in the report because it didn't happen until later today.
