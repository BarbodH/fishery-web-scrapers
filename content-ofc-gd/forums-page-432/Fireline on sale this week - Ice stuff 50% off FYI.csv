674227,BillM,2012-03-08 15:42:00,17367,Thanks!  Going to stock up!
674232,Roy,2012-03-08 16:06:00,13728,Yes $14.95 instead of $24.95 but the CTC here never carries bigger than 20lb test.
674257,Live2fish85,2012-03-08 17:46:00,1633,Good thing the stuff is garbage. lol.  I wouldn't pay that when Power pro is 3 bucks more. I got the new power pro on my new reel and its awesome.
674258,ah_long,2012-03-08 17:58:00,354,"BPS has the Suffix 832 on sale @ 20% off, time to stock up"
674357,bucktail,2012-03-09 00:36:00,1857,"Suffix 832 really is the way to go, I was really impressed with it last year and I have used all three extensively."
674396,Live2fish85,2012-03-09 01:26:00,1633,The new Power Pro slick  is way better.
674401,Roy,2012-03-09 01:47:00,13728,"Thanks for the heads up anyway, Darsky. Most of us appreciate it."
674404,e-z-out,2012-03-09 01:53:00,1052,Well said Roy
674438,BillM,2012-03-09 02:40:00,17367, 832 is awesome if you want to tip wrap like crazy!  Definitely not a line you want to fish topwaters with!
674937,atvaholic,2012-03-10 22:03:00,271,Thanks for the heads up...I just went and cleaned my store out of 6lb.
674939,Dabluz,2012-03-10 22:09:00,701,"I don't need any more Fireline.  Still using the first spool I ever bought when it first came out over 10 years ago.  I have bought other spools since then too.  The ice fishing stuff.....there was nothing that I needed.  I was hoping that the Rapala jigging minnows were on sale.  However, the store I went to also had a big bin full of lures on liquidation.  I bought a 14 cm Huskey Jerk in silver, blue with orange belly for 6 dollars and a 11 cm Rapala Deep Tail Dancer in a similar colour for 7.99"
674941,Weeds,2012-03-10 22:12:00,782,"I just picked up a spool of the Fireline Tracer braid, 40 pound test. Always willing to try something different, looks funky and for 14 bucks why not? I checked, the 65 pound Tracer was still regular price."
674946,boombap,2012-03-10 22:40:00,310, I picked up a spool of 20 # test in green. Do you notice there is just a tad bit of memory on it?
674964,davey buoy,2012-03-10 23:56:00,5505,I guess the bait casters and other reels weren't on sale yet?.
675108,Sudzy,2012-03-11 22:40:00,88,"Burlington store has a selection for 40% off.  Have rod bags, rods, scoops, tip ups, lots of augers ect.  Picked up a few things today."
