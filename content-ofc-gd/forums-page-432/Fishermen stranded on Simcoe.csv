675050,jedimaster,2012-03-11 16:46:00,3472," At some point you have to ask yourself is it me or bad luck? Clearly everyone and I mean everyone knew that area was not safe.  Everyone on every site had been talking about how the BBP area and pretty much anything on the east side was sketchy.  Heck I only went out once on simcoe this year and it took me all of 5 minutes to figure out the normal areas I go ice fishing were not safe.  There is allot of information out there on where the safe ice is and isn't. Yes everyone wants to fish and everyone wants to have fun, and noone wants anything bad to happen. Sometimes common sense should prevail.  This reminds me of a time about half a dozen years ago I was up on Opeongo. I was taking a group of newcomers to the sport up to the North arm for some lakers. When we were waiting for the water taxi there was a group of clearly inexperienced fishermen out in canoes. They couldn't paddle worth a crap, few if any of them had life jackets. The water was pretty rough that day. I called out to them to stay close to shore cause the water is rough. They heard me and kept going. We picked up a ride in the taxi and went on our way. A week later when we came down the guy told us about a group of canoers that went into the water right near the store and some of them drowned. I want to say something like within a few hundred feet of the docks. I knew instantly who it was.  I have been on the other end of advice I did't want to listen to but I have long since my lesson to listen to what people have to say. Safety before pride people. With the boating season coming up this should serve as a lesson to everyone. When people say its not safe, or put your lifejacket on, or watchout the waves on Lake X are bad, find another thing to do or make adjustements. Be informed and be safe. Don't let foolish pride get in the way of good judgement. Thankfully noone was hurt. Who is to blame? Not mother nature, she has been doing this for eon's and will continue to do so long after we leave. We are Fishermen. We are Outdoorsmen. Respect mother nature and she may just allow you to get home safe and sound."
675065,lookinforwalleye,2012-03-11 18:15:00,4399,Borelli called wants to know if you want to go ice fishing?  Once or twice each and every year icefishermen leave me shaking my head once again they did not disappoint!
675076,Sinker,2012-03-11 19:15:00,8692,"I hope everyone who reads this understands that it was an offshore wind that caused the problem. NEVER venture out on ice that ends at open water, with an offshore wind....EVER. Any thickness of ice can crack and go adrift with the wind. I'm sure there were some guys out there who just didn't know better, or never even gave the wind direction a thought, but there were guys out there who were just taking a chance.  They are all VERY lucky to be alive. Don't mess with Mother nature. She has no mercy, and will kill you in a second. She's a force not to take chances with.  S."
674829,MCTFisher9120,2012-03-10 14:43:00,3761," You are one of a kind you know that right.  Borrelli “I’ve been fishing on Lake Simcoe since I was five years old and I’ve never had anything like that happen,” he said. “We floated a good mile out (on the floe) before anybody got to us""  Maybe he's telling a fib or maybe not. Point is it was freakish that the wind blew it apart. Wind changes and you shouldn't be so silly to know that. Went from 10km to 50km gusts one day out there this winter. No warning or anything. We stuck it out and were fine. Might of happened like that also. It was very cold out too(-11 right now out that way) so the ice is not getting thinner, during this time frame we are looking at.  I don't know. I just think that those that go out for first ice like I have are a little crazy too but a concern is falling through. Not staying dry and floating off on a ice sheet. To me ur ""dumbass"" accusation on these individuals  is ignorant. Plain and simple. People went through on Scugog too the same day I was out there. I was on good ice they found the bad ice. It happens that way sometimes.  The dummies are the anglers at home like me wishing they were fishing"
674830,danbouck,2012-03-10 14:45:00,4380, Dummies because they didn't go out in bad conditions
674833,Dan668,2012-03-10 14:53:00,1120,"Have to agree with sal. With the winds lately and poor conditions why would you be out there. Third time being rescued, wow.."
674834,MCTFisher9120,2012-03-10 14:54:00,3761, Nope never said that Dan.
674836,mercman,2012-03-10 14:57:00,7054,"Fishing (all kinds) and boating are inherently dangerous sports.Everytime we go out on the ice or in our boats, we are taking certain risks.Should we stay at home and watch WFN, or weigh the risk factor, prepare for the worse case scenario, and go enjoy our passion  I think everyone of us has the dumb  gene in us. No exceptions."
674837,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-10 15:10:00,0,"  I'm really not.  I'd like to think MOST fisherman are smart enough not to get caught in that situation.  I'd say the guy who has been rescued 3x is one of a kind.  There is nothing FREAKISH about spring conditions... they are unpredictable... that's the whole point.  And if you see open water, don't go near it!"
674838,MCTFisher9120,2012-03-10 15:14:00,3761," Very true merc, i was out in my little tin boat this summer fishing away...flat water 2km from home dock. It's kind of funny but my seat in my boat has a hinge on each side of the back rest. Well when i leaned back the power wire for my trolling motor was in that hings just barely somehow...i moved the gas can around when i left dock and the wire was up not down on the floor.  I leaned back and pinched the wire, all of the sudden this 12' boat looked like a thick smoke cloud. I heard burning and saw smooke. Didn't know what was happening, I thought my motor 7.5 was on fire or the gas tank..ne was it was the cord rubber burning like a mother..pulled the wires off the battery and i just peeled the rubber off the wire while i pulled it. Point is this simple fishing evening could of had me dead like a bomb with that gas tank beside me.  As fishing goes, crap happens and i got a brand new Trolling motor the next day. Looking back at this I shake my head but hey were all just fishing in the end right."

674846,BillM,2012-03-10 15:28:00,17367, I'm just saying the wind took it's toll on the ice way before Friday morning...  That last wind storm was the kicker.
674849,woodenboater,2012-03-10 15:38:00,2277,"Although technically it wasn't one, offshore winds need to be respected.  For those in Barrie and the area, were there any official warnings about ice and wind conditions for Friday ?"
674850,Big Cliff,2012-03-10 15:42:00,6899,"Sue and I were out on Lake O when that storm hit. Everything was beautiful and the forecast was for it to stay that way then within minutes the sky changed color, and I headed for shore.  We were about 11 miles out in a 14' with a 25 on it. (before you go calling me stupid for even being out there in a 14'). This was a boat desigined for West coast waters and I had easily handled 10'+ waves with it so even though it was small it was desigined to handle rough conditions.  We were ok and made it back to shore, unfortunatly others didn't."
674852,Sinker,2012-03-10 16:05:00,8692,"Oddly enough, I have to agree with Dr. S on this one. Those guys should not have been out on that ice, with strong offshore winds. They are all lucky to be alive. The guy who has been rescued 3 times is just an idiot, clearly.  You can't mess with mother nature. She has no mercy. If you get in her way, your a goner!  However, I don't agree that they should be charged. They took a risk, and it went bad real fast. Hopefully the rest of them learn thier lesson. The 3 time rescue guy will pay the price one of these days, and I will have no sympathy for him at all. If you can't learn from your mistakes, you will never learn at all.  Glad everyone made it to shore safe. It could have been a lot worse.  S."
674854,misfish,2012-03-10 16:08:00,29133," When it sounds like a frieght train out there (due to the cables holding the tower) you know the winds are up in the 50-80 range. Now that I think of it,and this is true. When I left for work yesterday morning,it was loud,but I couldnt feel the wind. Is it possible the wind didnt reach down to where I was? Some barametric thing? It did get cold real fast when the wind did hit the lake."
674855,BillM,2012-03-10 16:10:00,17367," You made it back to shore because you were prepared and you knew your boat could handle the big water.   That's smart if you ask me, not stupid."

674888,Big Cliff,2012-03-10 18:09:00,6899,"Well, I guess that all I can say is: that if I ever make an error in judgement be it by incompetance or lack of information, no matter what the reason, I hope that my final days are not judged by some of the responders to this thread.  I would never intentionally put my life or the lives of others in jepordy. I would truly hope and pray that if the choice came down to ""him or me"" the choice would be to save him/her and let me go because I don't think I could live knowing that it cost someone elses life for me to survive.  I am so proud of the people that risked their lives to save the lives of others, I'd love to see OFC do something to recognize them. I personally stand and salute them with admeration in my heart. They are truly heros.  I am so pleased that no one lost their life through this whole ordeal. Young and old it doesn't matter, life is life. We all get but just one. It is how we choose to use it that matters most!  God bless the rescures, he has already blessed the survivors."

674774,moxie,2012-03-10 04:48:00,1566,Everything has been said. IMO there should be a small fine of maybe... $1000 each to help cover the cost and effort of the rescue but more importantly to give it a higher visibility since being rescued will probably just give them and others the idea that there will always be someone to pull our dumb asses out of harms way when we make bad decisions.
674776,ah_long,2012-03-10 04:55:00,354,"I do agree there should be a fine, but I don't think there's a law that allows us to fine them...  what happens if the guy says, i ain't paying the $1000, u gonna leave me to die or what?  I'm just saying without an existing law, it's hard to levy a fine against the idiots"
674781,chris.brock,2012-03-10 05:37:00,4053,"I was canoeing down a remote river, we dumped the canoe and lost it down a nasty rapid filled gorge. Way too far to walk out (no roads), we had to sattelite message for help. We were flown out by helicopter.  When they pick you up they don't mention fines or the potential for fines, they just get you out and safe. The OPP later asked us questions about our experience, how much we were drinking, smoking any dope, our equipment etc., I'm guessing to see if we were competent. I guess they deemed us competent, and the wrecked canoe was just back luck, and the trip out was no charge for us.  I'm glad these guys are safe, I think they should cover the bill though.  It is good to know, if you do need help, there's people and equipment to help you."
674782,Tdel,2012-03-10 05:37:00,393," I think you and Misfish are missing my point.  Anytime during the season when the ice is unsafe or questionable there are always people who access the ice because they have done it for years and know how to judge safe ice. This happens everywhere people ice fish.  There are always experts who disregard the warnings because they are smarter, more experienced and have done it for years. They don't listen to anyone telling them the ice is unsafe. They are the experts who disregard warnings from police and fellow fishermen and go out anyway.  They are usually regarded as experts until they break through the ice or need to be rescued. That is when all of a sudden they are called jerks and idiots by people who don't even know them.  I am sure many who were rescued today probably thought that they were experts, if they didn't, why were they out there disregarding warnings and taking a chance with their lives? How many times in this thread have they been called idiots and jerks by people who don't know them?  So an expert is only step away from being a jerk.  Don't worry your record of not flaming people on OFC continues, no heat was felt.  Tom."
674783,Cudz,2012-03-10 06:00:00,2652,possible fine is $410 per person per truck and 5 trucks were used.  Possible $2050 fines.  That was real training for the rescuers.  REally tested their equipment in horrible conditions.  Some equipment was not up to the challenge.  Similar to when the oro fire dept lost a boat a few years ago during a rescue.  Some stunning video from rescue.  Amazing how fast the ice sheets break up in the waves.  You think anyone was trolling off the back of the sheet? lol  Best possible scenario for all involved.  Incredible!  Glad the opp chopper was so close in Orillia.
674786,Chuck Best,2012-03-10 10:40:00,308,"After recieving a phone call from my good buddy who was the 3rd last man picked by the chopper,I really don't know what to say ,just glad they all made it home....We were on that spot on Weds.and we talked thurs.and both agreed not to go ,but it was -10 all night and my buddy went to look Fri. morning after watching the weather network for the forcast ,he says they were forcasting 10 k winds and all the water on top was frozen with not a breath of wind,so he decided to go.Well he got out there and it started to snow and when that stopped ,BAM in came the wind,he said it moved his portable with him in it and all he could do to stop from blowing away,was put his feet in the hut and his arm down the hole.....he held on for almost 5 mins ,then it stopped,he packed up and as soon as he was packed ,it came back with a vengence.He was fishing near 2 others and the 3 of them headed back to the dock at BBP,but got to about 90 fow and there was a 10 ft crack of open water ,so they turned around and headed for Oro.It was blinding winds with the snow that just fell and the whole bay started breaking up,they had to jump 3-4 cracks about 2 ft wide to get to the large group of people,but when they were waiting to get picked up,all he could do was lie on the ice as not to get blown in.He says he looked at the sheet they were on and 30 yds to the left there was 3 ft waves and 30 yds right of him,same thing...Glad they all made it and that's quite an end to this years season.....TC and tight lines all......Chuck..."

My only comment is how many people have gone out on the lake when the forcast said light winds but then in a couple minutes the wind changes and the winds turn to a gale from the worst possible direction.  I am glad we have people trained for these events. Sometimes stuff happens.  If there was a fine I would pay it and smile.. If there was no fine I would be making a donation to the fund for fallen rescuers.  Now back to prepping my boat for spring

Where I was last weekend off the 4th the ice was 1"" think in spots with 3"" of half frozen slush on top.  My foot broke through once.  Spud went thru in one hit several times.  It's great they everyone survived, and only the idiot on the quad who tried to jump the crack got injured.  Watching the video, I'm very surprised that someone didn't loose their life.  We can sleep easy tonight knowing that no fellow fisherman lost their lives.  Hopefully a few people learned a lesson today"
674691,misfish,2012-03-10 00:40:00,29133,This will make a great thread for every ice season to come. Should be pinned  before every ice season.
674692,Tdel,2012-03-10 00:40:00,393,"It seems to be that if you go out on the ice and fall through, you are an idiot, jerk, dumb, stupid or Darwin's candidate, etc.  If you don't go through the ice you are an expert, knowledgeable ice fisherman, experienced, careful, safety minded, or I have been doing this for 20 years and never fell through. etc.  Sometimes the former are the same people as the latter. The only difference is whether you break through the ice or not.  Tom."
674702,misfish,2012-03-10 00:54:00,29133," I think you are missing something,,,,,,,,,  There have been many warning from ""those that know,knowledgeable ice fisherman"" that have been posting on this and other sites,the ice was not safe.  It really funny how there,s complaints about guys posting thier catch and back grounds on the WWW,then when the real deal meaning stuff,LIKE UNSAFE ICE,gets a back seat,and when the filtered try again please hits the fan,it comes down to this.  LOL The good the bad and the ugly. Sorry Bruce"
674704,kickingfrog,2012-03-10 00:58:00,8333,Some people risked their lives and were very fortunate today despite their decisions.   Some people risked their lives because that's their job (and we thank them).   Some people stayed home based on the conditions.

674714,Joey,2012-03-10 01:12:00,9122," Well I stayed home all season, so that makes me smart, safe and terribly bored   That being said, it was a valiant effort on behalf of the rescuers and a bit of stupidity on behalf of the fishermen.  We all go out there thinking we'll be safe and will make it home to our warm bed at the end of the fishing day with a sink full of fish.  Sometimes that happens, sometimes it doesn't."

All the ice fisherman that I fish with, who I trust with my life, all gave up on this area last weekend.  They ALL strongly warned everyone to stay away from that area for the rest of this season.  I'm glad these guys all survived, but I'm ashamed on their behalf as an ice fisherman.  They shouldn't have been there.  End of story."

You are driving down the road, it was claer and dry. You suddenly hit a patch of black ice that shouldn't have been there. ""OH crap""!  You put something on the BBQ, the phone rings, you answer it and get distracted. Next thing you know the BBQ is on fire and close to setting everything within easy range on fire ""OH crap""!  People in their right mind don't go out there to put their or anyone elses live at risk but sometimes ""OH crap"" happens. Cut these people some slack and I truly hope you never find yourself in an ""OH crap"" situation but if you do, I hope there is a HERO there to give you another chance!"

674633,tonyb,2012-03-09 20:59:00,1637,"  The problem is inexperience, many guys will go out just because someone else is out there.  It's never a good idea to be on ice adjacent to open water first of all, and more importantly not when the wind is blowing hard (40KM/Hr today) towards open water!    Uploaded with ImageShack.us"
674634,BillM,2012-03-09 21:03:00,17367,That ice was 3 inches thick two weeks ago..  There were guys riding around on snowmobiles and 4wheelers..   Talk about stupid!

674636,Rod Caster,2012-03-09 21:10:00,5784,"Great job by the rescuers!  Each person on the ice flow had the opportunity to step back, assess the situation and decide if they were willing to take that risk. ..unless they were kids, addicts or mentally challenged, the responsibility was their own but the consequences were shared.  Police warning, high winds, warm temps, open water are all clear signs that they should not have been ice fishing in that area.  Luckily everyone survived, it could have been worse. That's some scary but it will make people in other countries laugh."

674642,lew,2012-03-09 21:27:00,12766,"My brother used to be a volunteer firemen and they received a call late one night from someone in a cottage saying he could hear someone calling for help out on the ice somewhere.  My brother and 3 other firemen took a ladder and some ropes and started out towards the voices.  Trouble was the ice was very weak and they actually broke thru a couple times but eventually they located the fisherman in the water. One man was dead and the other was close to it.  They used the ladder to get close enough and tie ropes on them and eventually they pulled the fishermen out and got the one man back to shore and into the waiting ambulance then went back to retrieve the dead man.  My brother and the other 3 rescuers did an excellent job in a very serious situation but very nearly died themselves in the process.  So yes, some folks make mistakes and die, but sadly they often take the rescuers with them.  Be careful out there folks."

We have never looked at thease men as stupid in any way , just today it was the wrong place at the wrong time ."

I squeeze my butt cheeks every time i see or hear of people out on the ice but this will go on for ever and hopfuly we will always have others who will go get them if they get in trouble . Theres nothing any of us can do to stop it and i except that and wish them a safe return ."
674660,adempsey,2012-03-09 22:25:00,1498,"Ice fishing is generally fairly safe if you use your head and follow some simple rules.   The thing is, people have been fishing that area on Simcoe for quite some time and I am sure those anglers thought today wouldn't be any different.   I am sure they all knew that fishing in that area so close to open water wasn't particularly safe...but, nothing happened last week or the week before, right?   People take those sort of risks every day.  Ever drive down the 401?  Half the people are doing 140km/h+.  If that's not dangerous for them and everyone else on the highway, I don't know what is.  Personally I have not fished for whitefish/trout on Simcoe at all this year because I am not at all comfortable fishing in Kemp bay with open water to the east on the main lake.   It was just a matter of time before the wind pushed that ice out.  I am surprised it hasn't happened sooner.  Anyway, I am glad everyone was returned safe and there were no unfortunate mishaps with the emergency personnel."
674562,Joey,2012-03-09 17:39:00,9122,Just watching CTV news and they say some fishermen are stranded on a piece of ice that broke off and is floating  Search and rescue being dispatched!!!

674586,fishnsled,2012-03-09 18:33:00,3520,"First and foremost, I hope everyone is OK.  Not sure why anyone would trust that area for fishing right now. Anyone shed some light on this? I guess I'm over cautious but would be interested in knowing what the conditions are like up there. Certainly different early in the season when you have 3-5 inches of good clear ice. But now with the mild temps and rains, I would think that ice would be going honeycomb, maybe I'm wrong.  Not trying to stir anything up here, just more for my own interest."
674588,BillM,2012-03-09 18:37:00,17367,"After the winds we've had the past couple days and the main lake being open for the past 2 weeks, I can't understand why ANYONE would be out there in places where it would be considered 'iffy'..   Hell I wouldn't even be out in Kemp..."
674591,Terry,2012-03-09 18:40:00,14456,there was a fair bit of ice there yesterday a guy was bombing around in a truck... if it wasn't windy there would be no issue  some of the shoreline was open but once on the ice there's lots of ice but mother nature thought Beaverton needed the ice more then Shanty Bay

674599,Joey,2012-03-09 18:53:00,9122,"Yup, an OPP helicopter rescued two rescuers and an air boat just got the rest.  Terrible conditions out there tho, windy, broken ice.  Sheesh.  Kudos to them all for a great effort, hope they are okay as I saw them slipping and falling into the water alot!"

None of us go out there thinking ""I'm going to go get myself into trouble and see how long it takes to rescue me"" do we? We go out there thinking we are safe, have taken all the necessary precautions or unless we have a death wish we wouldn't go.  Suddenly you find yourself in a situation where you underestimated/overestimated a situation and you could be fighting for your life. If you survive it's usually because of heros and people call you stupid. If you don't survive some people still seem to like to call you stupid! It is way too easy to judge someone else isn't it?"

While we sit safely in our homes wondering what would possess these folks to be out there, they had an itch. Truth is some of these folks could be OFC'ers or even a good friend. I hope they all return home safely and I'd be remiss if I didn't applaud the heroic efforts of the rescue people. Watching the helicopter video a few moments ago clearly showed how nasty and precariously close to death many faced out there, not nice!"
674607,kickingfrog,2012-03-09 19:26:00,8333,"Agreed, no one heads out thinking ""I'm gonna' be on T.V."" but we are also judging someone by questioning their comments.  So yes, it is too easy to judge someone else."
