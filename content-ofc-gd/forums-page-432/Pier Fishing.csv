Are there many people out there this time of year? or just on select rivers that have opened seasons? I'm talking about lake Ontario tribs btw. I'm not asking where the best places are just if it is a common method this time of year. Thanks"
674158,fishindevil,2012-03-08 11:24:00,6254,"yes go now !!! guys have been hitting fish off the piers for weeks,places like the ganny,oshawa,whitby bommanville,lots to pick from"
674180,BITEME,2012-03-08 13:23:00,1968,Yep they are out there!
674201,torco,2012-03-08 14:45:00,656,"Most piers along Lake Ontario are open all year and you can get into fish all year round, my guess based on timing is that now would be a good time. Enjoy, and good luck."
674270,esoxansteel,2012-03-08 18:50:00,1307,"Theve been in the rivers for over 5 months now, yes there is extended seasons on many rivers, and fishing into the lake is zone 20 and is always open.  "
674289,elusive,2012-03-08 20:08:00,77,Lots of fish to be caught both at the piers and extended open areas on the creeks!

Saw fish about 50-100ft from shore but good luck casting your roe that far.  I'll be taking a spinning setup along with a new crankbait rod/bait caster and some lures and try my luck."
