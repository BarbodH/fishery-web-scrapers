673940,davey buoy,2012-03-07 19:36:00,5505,Semi solid ice 1 hour ago at tiffin. Still doesn't look good for a while yet.
673969,misfish,2012-03-07 21:10:00,29133,Back it in at the bridge in Angus.
674001,Skipper D,2012-03-07 22:19:00,1970,"  Thank you Brian , i think am to big to go in there . I find it hard to beleive how fast it happens when it starts , guess it wont be to much longer if we have this weather a bit longer . Thank you too Dave ."
674009,misfish,2012-03-07 22:42:00,29133,"If you really need a perch feed,fish the shore line open spots."
674010,Billy Bob,2012-03-07 22:45:00,5865,"Lots of open water down here......boat coming out of winter sleeping next Wed or Thursday........then maybe some CALICO fishing, weather permitting......"
674012,misfish,2012-03-07 22:48:00,29133, CALICO = Crappie. I be all over that.C&R.
674048,Rizzo,2012-03-08 00:43:00,4754," whooh, thanks for clarifying. I thought BB was out fishing for cats. Now that's a Redneck!"
674099,Sinker,2012-03-08 03:00:00,8692,"You guys are looking for an open boat launch, and I was driving on the lake today  Crazy season this has been.  S."
674161,Billy Bob,2012-03-08 11:33:00,5865, Here kitty kitty kitty..... 
674932,Rob,2012-03-10 21:49:00,467,"There are a couple of spots in Oro that you could put a small boat in now. Just past the 7th on ice road is one spot and the other would be the 6th line. You would need a 4x4 due to the snow and ice on the road to the water, but the shoreline is pretty much free of ice. I haven't checked the 9th line boat launch so not sure how it is looking.  Rob C"
674936,Skipper D,2012-03-10 21:58:00,1970,"  Awsome RC , i'll have to take ride over that way tomorrow ."
674948,misfish,2012-03-10 22:53:00,29133, You failed to mention the windshield tag thats required.
674949,Skipper D,2012-03-10 23:00:00,1970,"Heyyyy !  ....lol    	If theres no docks at thease spots , not sure cause i've never used them before , my boat might be to big to launch at them . If there any thing like the spot at the sixth , i now i can't launch there ."
674952,davey buoy,2012-03-10 23:15:00,5505, I wonder if Gull Rock Marina would let you launch?Years ago kept a boat there.
674954,Skipper D,2012-03-10 23:24:00,1970,"  I dont mind if i have to wait till the ice gets out of the bay , its those nice sunny days till then that worry me .... lol ."
675025,Cudz,2012-03-11 14:21:00,2652,nope. Golden Medonte now. Private.  I think there is more open water now around shanty bay.  lol!  Maybe too early for joking around about that.
675028,Skipper D,2012-03-11 14:53:00,1970,"This is my first year to have a boat in the spring ,  when dose it start to happen generally at the Tiffen st Launch ?"
675034,davey buoy,2012-03-11 15:26:00,5505,"I would think Ron this year especially,you'll see boats out as soon as it's safe to do so. Ice fishing being short for lakers and whities for most."
