674505,Gerritt,2012-03-09 13:17:00,6129,"Does anyone own one of these tents? they seem very cool and if they do as they say, I am thinking it is time to get rid of alot of my old tents...    http://www.tentsile.com/  G"
674506,lew,2012-03-09 13:24:00,12766,Could be kinda dangerous for sleep walkers
674514,Roy,2012-03-09 14:00:00,13728,The heaviest dude gets unwanted company every night.
674518,Rod Caster,2012-03-09 14:16:00,5784,Very cool idea. I'd be interested in the 2man version... but i'm sure the price won't interest me.  I'm not sure if it would be more or less bear safe. One slice at the bottom and watch the pinata candy fall out...  
674527,whiskywizard,2012-03-09 15:21:00,305,I've slept on enough rock in my life to think this is a pretty cool idea. How much are they?
674529,johnnyb,2012-03-09 15:29:00,3413,"Seems more novel than practical.  The 2-person weighs more than a tent that will comfortably sleep two....and certainly doesn't seem to have much room.  The 3-4 person is cool...but heavy, having to rely on trees or set up those huge poles they show in some of the pics....I don't know.  I suppose if you are setting up at a not-too remote campsite and just want it for the ""cool"" factor....doesn't appeal to me though"
674533,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-09 15:41:00,10439,  That's exactly what came to mind as soon as I saw it!!! That and the fact that it would suck on the tundra!!!
674535,Musky or Specks,2012-03-09 15:43:00,2710,I'll take my Hennesey hammock over that anytime  http://hennessyhammock.com/catalog/#hammock
674542,solopaddler,2012-03-09 16:28:00,8605,"I can see several inherent design flaws.  For car camping check out Oz Tents. Very pricey, but probably worth it."

674559,NAW,2012-03-09 17:26:00,4022,Neat idea..  Not for me though.  I can set my tent up in a few minutes.  And what would happen if I tried to wake my wife up after some night trolling for walleye..  Not much room in one of those limbs for two. Just sayin
674606,d_paluch,2012-03-09 19:16:00,343,I don't know about you guys but when I go camping I enjoy drinking around a campfire. We all know how that ends up at the end of a night...I wouldn't want to be climbing up a tree to sleep......   I guess it would be fun though
674610,Terry,2012-03-09 19:34:00,14456,if the person buying it drinks if the person trying to get up into it drinks if the person wondering how to get out of it to pee drinks if the person sleeping in it drinks  I can see him spending many nights laying on the ground looking up wondering how to get up there or wondering how he got down there  taking a pee a 2 in the morning would be a pain too  not for me
674611,Spiel,2012-03-09 19:36:00,9065," I see a market for ""Depends"" sleeping bags."
674612,Terry,2012-03-09 19:38:00,14456,now that would sell   well I guess it depends
674752,John Bacon,2012-03-10 02:47:00,3277, Probably more unpleaseant for the guy in the first sentance than the one in the second sentance... just saying.
