674959,ld17,2012-03-10 23:40:00,319,So does anyone know if we have to register or make phone calls before we move into US waters.  Are we going to get fines.  Who should I call.  Thanks
674961,Joeytier,2012-03-10 23:44:00,3990,"That's a pretty vague question.  If you are fishing in US waters, you have to have all appropriate licenses and papers with you, depending on the state you're in.  Simple as that."
674965,irishfield,2012-03-10 23:58:00,26272,You'd better have a passport in your pocket as well....
674967,Steve Piggott,2012-03-11 00:02:00,196,Call this # 1-888-226-7277 when you come back into Canadian waters Give them the information they ask for If they send a guy to the launch stay in your boat and wait for them. No big deal.As far as going from Canadian side to the U.S waters just go and fish with a NY state license. To obtain your N.Y license call: 1-866-933-2257. Please allow 10 business days for delivery by mail. Don't touch land or anchor in U.S waters and you should be OK.
674995,Pigeontroller,2012-03-11 02:59:00,2793,"I fish NY waters...Was told by a border guard carry your passport to avoid any trouble. Last spring I was topped by NY DEC and County Sheriff, they only asked to see licenses and PFDs...I won't be calling the 1-800# when I return home...I'll just have to risk it!"
674997,ld17,2012-03-11 03:01:00,319, thanks
675002,mercman,2012-03-11 03:33:00,7054, Hummmmm....i wouldnt be saying that too loudly on a public forum Dax.
675012,Bondar,2012-03-11 06:43:00,817,"I'm not surprised thats all the New York guys asked for as that law has nothing to do with them , it's when you come back home that there may be a problem"
675022,Paulus,2012-03-11 13:16:00,522,"So it's very similar to border customs. Going there is no problem, it's always coming back that's the headache."
675205,Billy Bob,2012-03-12 10:03:00,5865,"Up  until last year the deal was you could travel back and forth visa versa as long as you did NOT anchor and did NOT dock or come a ground....but that all changed last summer when a NYS fishermen got fined in Ontario Waters while fishing the St Lawrence.....there was a big article last year in the Buffalo News......but then I ""think"" both countries have since back off again and it's back to where it use to be, come and go freely...but that can change again in the blink of an eye..... ....I, myself have fished in Canadian waters hundreds of times while launching out of Buffalo in Lake Erie and will continue to do so....so if you read about a crazy Redneck being dragged into Ontario jail, it's only me..."
675208,mercman,2012-03-12 10:53:00,7054,"  If that happens Bob, use you free call and let me know. I will get another Canadian survival kit to you"
675209,Billy Bob,2012-03-12 11:01:00,5865, But it has to include the Canadian Maple Syrup and you have to include the vanilla ice cream....
675210,Skipper D,2012-03-12 11:03:00,1970,Our Canadian guys working this side of the water have gone up to my brothers boat on the St Lawrence and checked him out then after told him 30' feet more that way was U.S waters and that he did'nt want to go there . What was that all about ?
675211,Billy Bob,2012-03-12 11:05:00,5865," They didn't want to lose him.....once they cross over to our side, most never go back....LOL"
675212,Skipper D,2012-03-12 11:07:00,1970,"  What , you don't want the Maple Syrup candy file Billy Bob with that ......... lol"
