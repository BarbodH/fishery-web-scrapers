It's been an easy winter but I've still had more than plenty.  And also folks, with the time change its also time to replace the batteries in all your smoke and co2 detectors."
674881,Roy,2012-03-10 17:38:00,13728,"Yes, twice a year like clockwork.  And Lew is right, it's a great time to change all of the batteries in the battery powered detectors. I've gotten into the habit of changing them twice a year, every time change. Test each detector afterwards.  We're looking at a 16 for Thursday here."
