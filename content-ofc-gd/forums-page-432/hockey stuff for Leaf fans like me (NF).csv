674130,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-08 04:17:00,0,  ouch.  we're not all like muskymatt you know.  i would have thought you would have said habs fans.  i haven't met any toronto or ottawa fans as obnoxious as a habs fan when they are winning. OLAYYYYYYYYYY!
674146,chris.brock,2012-03-08 05:35:00,4053,"Alot of guys at work seem to have choosen to be fans of teams that consistantly do well, I don't get it really, we don't get many RedWing's games on TV over here, at least Musky Matt now lives in Ottawa so that makes sense"
674148,chris.brock,2012-03-08 05:45:00,4053,"I was at a Leafs game in Tampa against the Lightning, there was about equal Leafs/ Bolts jerseys, but the Leaf fans were louder (not like the suits sitting on their hands in the ACC), it was pretty cool"
674174,muskymatt,2012-03-08 13:08:00,2608,"Dis me eh? And a big ""ARE YOU FREEKING KIDDING ME""??????? Scotia bank place against the leafs is like taking my purebred lab to the dog park and a bunch of yappy ornery little pocket dogs won't leave you alone. I witnessed a leaf fan sucker punch and knock 3 teeth out of a Sens fans mouth for simply razzing the leaf fan after a loss. The leaf fan looked to be in his 40's and the other guy was just a kid, probably 20. I've sat with my dad and had to listen to F bombs dropped by leaf fans like they were getting paid for profanity. My dads in his 70's, do you think he enjoys that? I have seen leaf fans staggering around pissed to the gills puking in the garbage cans. All because they wanted to go ""out cheers the sens fan in our own building"", come on. You call that being a hockey fan??? I don't!! Ignorant, disrespectful, out of control little asses if you ask me! There has been a few time's my old man has saved a leaf fan form a beating! So how did the laffs do last night boys?????????? Another year with no playoffs and as far as I'm concerned it's karma! You get what you deserve! Bahahaahahahahaha"

674198,bushart,2012-03-08 14:36:00,2628,What gets me about Habs fans---and not dumpin on the team  the fans want to cheer and Ref the game---gets annoying
674199,bushart,2012-03-08 14:39:00,2628,Also Matt----if you wanted to see fan clashes  should have seen some of the Cats/Argos games at Ivor Wynne when I was a kid  Was not a blue friendly zone
674209,muskymatt,2012-03-08 14:58:00,2608,"I can imagine, I've heard some stories about it!"
674213,solopaddler,2012-03-08 15:10:00,8605,"   Ever heard the expression ""the pot calling the kettle black""?"
674215,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-08 15:13:00,0,it's not a diss...  you're just really good at being obnoxious!
674221,solopaddler,2012-03-08 15:16:00,8605," I'm a diehard Cats fan, had seasons tickets for years. You're right back in the day that was a ferocious rivalry...not so much anymore.  Ivor Wynn is still the best place to watch a game, you're literally right on top of the players.  Something will be lost when they build the new stadium next year."
674224,bushart,2012-03-08 15:39:00,2628,L'il off topic here Solo---sad to see Medlock go to nfl  I guess good for him
674226,muskymatt,2012-03-08 15:41:00,2608,"LoL, why thank you!!"
674229,solopaddler,2012-03-08 15:47:00,8605,"  No kidding that's a huge blow. A bit surprised Carolina signed him, the No Fun League doesn't like left footed kickers.  Wish they'd have have kept Wilbur last year in training camp instead of Medlock. Now the Cats are screwed LOL!"
674284,[emailÂ protected],2012-03-08 19:52:00,119," That's two more teeth than I expected him to have.  Gotta say, I would be puking in the garbage cans too, if I had to spend any amount of time in that dump of a city.  Ottawa sucks."
674303,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-08 21:31:00,0, you two are made for each other.
674306,muskymatt,2012-03-08 21:47:00,2608, LOL Right! LOL
674511,Frank,2012-03-09 13:55:00,74," I've never been a Leaf fan, but I respect the Maple Leafs and their history in hockey, pretty much say the same for all original six teams. My family is heavily into stock car racing and I grew up going to race tracks all over eastern Canada and USA. I never really got into hockey until 1999 or so, when a friend brought me to a Jr B game and I have been hooked since. My team of choice is the Columbus Blue Jackets as I have been following them since they came into the League in 2000, I loved their Logos and colours and hockey was a new sport to me and a new team just came in the NHL so that was my team and I have been faithful ever since. (Jackets aren't any better than the Leaf's either...lol) I live in Welland, Ontario and we are technically in Buffalo Sabres territory and for some reason, the NHL would rather block the Sabres televised games here (unless you buy sports pack) cause we are apparently in ""Leafs"" territory, I am sorry, but 20 minutes from Buffalo, NY as opposed to 75 minutes from Toronto, makes us in Sabres territory, but the news agencies, radio stations and NHL would rather shove the Maple Leafs down our throats here.  Go Jackets!"
674670,muskymike,2012-03-09 23:47:00,772," Matt,  I as a Leaf fan completely agree with you. I was at the 5-0 Leaf/Sens game last month. I knew at least 40 people there, maybe more. 3 of which were completely hammered, rude and insulting, those are just the people I knew. I saw MANY others acting the same way. Its disgusting actually. BUT, I also saw the same amount of Sens fans acting the same way. There were definitely more Blue and White jerseys at the game, and yes, Leafs fans were louder. But the Sens fans are equally as bad.  I go to at least 30 of the Sens games a year, unfortunately I get given my seats which are always in the 100's. I listen to obnoxious Sens fans who do nothing but talk really bad about the Leafs and Habs and never say anything good about their own team. (this happens at least 60% of the time). That's the issue with most Sens fans, its not that they love their team, they hate the teams to the east and the west whereas Leafs and Habs fans just love their respective teams.  So, as much as you are 100% correct, you are 100% incorrect as well. There are Leaf fans that are embarrassing to a lot of us, and hopefully you see the same in your Sens fans, they exist just like we do.  Keep up the Leaf bashing, it is entertaining to say the least. You bring out the best in a few.  PS. I still want to get out on the river with you. Lets get out this summer if you are down."
674759,muskymatt,2012-03-10 03:14:00,2608,"A reply worth listening to, thanks MM. Lots of good, valid points! And yes to getting out this summer, good times!"
673751,chris.brock,2012-03-07 03:32:00,4053,"I grew up watching the Leafs with my Dad, 30+ years ago, on CHCH on Wednesday nights, and on CBC on Saturdays and have been a fan ever since. I've always lived in the GTA, and always followed the Leafs. The friends, and friends of friends and co-workers who claim they are fans of other teams tick me off, the teams they jump on the bandwagon with are always solid teams- Detroit, Boston, Flyers, Habs, etc, I don't know any Blue Jacket , Panther or even Predator fans, I think they should go away and live in the city with their teams, it doesn't make sense to me"
673752,muskymatt,2012-03-07 03:35:00,2608,Spoken like only a laff fan can! You might want to get out of TO for a bit into the real world! Might do you some good.
673753,irishfield,2012-03-07 03:36:00,26272,"""Make sense"".. maybe they don't live in the land of make believe    (and yes I'm a Leaf's fan as well.. )"
673762,chris.brock,2012-03-07 03:42:00,4053,"I know we (the Leafs) have sucked, but they're my team and always will be, ""I Am Canadian"", this is where I grew up and live, and I'm in it for the long haul (for better or worse)"
673767,muskymatt,2012-03-07 03:46:00,2608,"What does being a laff fan have to do with being Canadian? There are plenty of other good Canadians who are fans of other teams, some even of US teams! See, that's where the Laff fan mentality irks non laff fans."
673771,chris.brock,2012-03-07 03:51:00,4053,"yeah, there are, there have been and likely always will be, other ""good"" teams I could choose to become a fan of, the leafs suc but so do the sens how many sens shirts and hats do you see when you're travelling abroad? it's all leafs and some habs"
673774,muskymatt,2012-03-07 03:55:00,2608,LoL
673792,Sebastian,2012-03-07 04:52:00,208, You seem to follow the Leaf posts very closely. We get it. You dont like them. You call them Laffs. Haha very funny. Every hockey thread goes 10 pages because of your criticism. Get over it.
673801,hawk-eye,2012-03-07 07:00:00,141, I think he is just trying to get his fix of hockey talk. TO seems to be the only place where the fans care enough about the team to talk about them. Walk into a sports bar in Ottawa and they have CPAC on the tubes.  I like how every comment seems to come off as an insult. If you hate Leaf fans that much.....dont talk to us.
673812,Radnine,2012-03-07 11:36:00,1538," Let me get this straight; People that like other teams should sell everything they own, uproot their families, and move to where those teams are. Yup, you're a leafs fan alright. Jim"
673823,Rod Caster,2012-03-07 12:43:00,5784,"as proud of gustavsen as they come!  I'm a coyotes/jets fan because when I was kid collecting hockey cards I liked their team and I've stuck with them.  You must love the thousands of young ""penguins"" fans who follow that team because of Crosby!"
673829,Hud,2012-03-07 13:15:00,140,Go Blackhawks!
673835,Lungelarry,2012-03-07 13:33:00,294,"Boston Bruin fan since 1967......... I never understand the reasoning of having to like a team because you live there. To me its like religon,just because your parents are of a faith ,doesn,t mean you have to be the same,use your own brain and choose because YOUR experiences and ideas(free thinking). I saw Bobbby Orr play in the Jrs.and decided at 10years old ,that would be my team......You have choices in life."
673841,SirCranksalot,2012-03-07 13:51:00,3291,If the Leafs won the cup every 30 years or so then everybody would be happy!!

673885,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-07 16:59:00,0,"there are bandwagoners in every sport for every team, including your precious leafs.  i know plenty of leaf fans that disappear for months at a time and then as soon as they win 2 straight the hats and t-shirts come out, and the annoying facebook messages start... habs fans are especially notorious for disappearing... hell, in their 100th season i didn't know the habs HAD that many fans!  it's funny that you associate cheering for the leafs with being canadian though... that's very typical of leafs fans, and why they are the laughing stock of the country."
673897,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-07 17:36:00,0,"this is by the author of the ""crap MY DAD SAYS"" website on being the fan of a sports team.. hahaha... It's not for minors as it contains coarse language but it gives perspective for all of us fanATICS.  http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7654198/the-writer-crap-my-dad-says-why-your-team-give-damn-you"
673901,Headhunter,2012-03-07 17:47:00,5703,"The Leafs are Canada's team... there is no denying it! Check out any road game they play and tell me that you don't see any Leaf jersey's in the crowd. Very much like the Yankee's are America's team as well as the Cowboys... It sure makes them easy to hate, doesn't it!? I think that that alone, is enough to get every other fan worked up! And the Leaf's propensity towards making stupid personel decisions and their inability to win anything of significance also makes them an easy target. Haters are gonna hate! HH"
673905,walleyejigger,2012-03-07 18:13:00,876,"I've had the pleasure of listening to the same debate at a well known ""southern Ontario"" university. It came down to pretty much a somewhat racist approach to sports. ""I'm Canadian, so I cheer for the leafs"" how that makes any sense is beyond me, but it is interesting.  I myself am Canadian, born and raised in northern Ontario, There are photos of me around 2-3 years old with an oilers jersey. Why? I have no idea. My mother says it was because it was in the early Gretzky era and the jerseys were abundant n cheap. A few years later i got my first habs jersey. Why? I have no idea. But I've been a proud habs fan ever since. What boggles my mind the most is my mother hates hockey, and my father is a leafs fan.  To say all Canadians have to cheer for Toronto, or any Canadian team for that matter is narrow minded. Plain and simple. I guess that comes from a Toronto is the be all and end all of Canada state of mind. Have fun down there.  It's a game, quit over analyzing it and enjoy it for what it is.... a game."
673906,solopaddler,2012-03-07 18:13:00,8605,      Chris you're welcome in my boat any time buddy.
673928,Governator,2012-03-07 19:11:00,879,"  Thanks, that was a great & hilarious read and by all means true.     While I agree Toronto has one of the biggest fanbase in the league, the fans don't do the team any favours by spending the $ they do for the product they get.  From merchandise to tickets, leaf fans have to break away from their stubborn ways and not give them more $ then they deserve. They are only ""Canada's team"" by geographic location and being an original 6.  It's Canada's team because it's Toronto, the most populated city in Canada.  Aside from that, it's run by Americans and played by foreigners (Unless 'call up Kadri' counts).  It's funded by blinded rich folks who feel the ACC is a good place to either show off their latest Armani suit or host a business meeting all the while being waited on for overpriced drinks.  I've had the displeasure of watching the Leafs fail all my life.  I've been to dozens of games, tickets given to me each year but in 2008, I remember just sitting there in the golds surrounded by guys in suits in every direction not caring about anything on the ice.  It irritated me to the point that I have no desire to go anymore, I'd rather be at an OHL game any day of the week.  I'd bet money that when the Leafs play in Buffalo or Ottawa there is just as many if not more Leaf jerseys in the crowds then at the ACC.  It's sad, the real fans deserve to be treated better, both on the ice and in their own building.  I go to a few Barrie Colts games each year and have a blast every time.  OHL is a different breed and a lot more for fun, not to mention every fan cares about the team on the ice."
673930,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-07 19:14:00,0, I am a season ticket holder with the soo greyhounds.  I love OHL hockey because it is phenomenal hockey by kids who have something more than money to play for.
673934,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-07 19:17:00,0,"  There's only one ""canada's"" team so get over yourselves.  "
674114,blaque,2012-03-08 03:34:00,2419, I can vouche for that. The Toronto fans actually create a fun atmosphere. I'll give you 3 guesses which out of town fans consistantly make me wish I hadn't bought a ticket???
674129,solopaddler,2012-03-08 04:11:00,8605," That's easy, Ottawa fans."
