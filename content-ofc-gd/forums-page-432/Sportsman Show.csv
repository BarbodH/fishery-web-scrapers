I was wondering if anyone here cold confirm this? I would like to take the kids and that is a pretty good deal if it is actually true."
674672,muskymike,2012-03-09 23:51:00,772," Can't confirm as I am stuck in Ottawa and only get 640 every once in a while, but every year they have a really good price after $5, so you probably heard right."
674674,d_paluch,2012-03-09 23:58:00,343,"You heard correct! Sponsored by Rapala, $5 after 5!"
674696,captpierre,2012-03-10 00:44:00,2521,Glad you mentioned the $5 after 5pm.  Nothing about it on the website.  Only open till 8pm.  6pm on Sunday
674700,express168,2012-03-10 00:50:00,327,"Thanks for the confirmation, and your right it isn't on the website. The kids are usually tired after about 2 hours of it anyway so the $5.00 deal is perfect."
