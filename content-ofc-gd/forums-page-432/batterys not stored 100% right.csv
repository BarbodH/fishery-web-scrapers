675068,skinny,2012-03-11 18:31:00,442,ok here is what I did  I took them out of my boat late October or November and put them in my non heated garage on a piece of wood and I guess walked away (I thought I put my sloar charger on them). So today I happened to kind trip on them and thought oh no I didn't do anything to them.  I have a solar charger and a big shop type battery charge that will do 2 amp charge.  What should I do to hopefully lesson and damages from not keeping them cycleling .  one is a group 27 interstate the other is a nautalist battery both deep cycle I believe  any pointers would be great
675069,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-11 18:39:00,10439,Stick them on a charger and bring them up to full charge. Hopefully they had a decent charge when you put them away or they might have froze. Check to see if the cases are bulging at all. If they are they probably froze and you will be out purchasing new ones.

675073,Roy,2012-03-11 19:10:00,13728,"Don't get sidetracked by technicalities. If you have a meter, tell us the voltage readings on both the Interstate and Nautilus are. Then tell us what the liquid levels are in both batteries."
675074,Sinker,2012-03-11 19:12:00,8692,"That's all I ever do to my batteries. As long as they were charged when you left them there, they should be fine. Hook them up to your charger and charge them up. They should be fine.  S."
675078,skinny,2012-03-11 19:22:00,442,ok I just stuck the interstate on a 2amp charge and as soon as i find my solar charger I will add it to the other I'm pretty sure they both had near full charge on them when I took them out.
675082,Roy,2012-03-11 19:47:00,13728,And placing them on a piece of wood doesn't help anything either. On the concrete floor will do just fine.
675096,skinny,2012-03-11 21:10:00,442,I know way back i was told that now days it didn't matter if on wood or not . but back long time ago was always told not to put batterys on concrete. I guess old ways stay around  the interstate when to full charge with in an hour have swiched to other now
675101,Sinker,2012-03-11 22:02:00,8692,I'd say they're fine.
675126,Fisherman,2012-03-12 00:19:00,7201, Very good article. I've got a couple of CTEK chargers keeping my batteries happy.
675127,Dutch,2012-03-12 00:22:00,831,Charge 'em up and maybe do a quick load test.  They'll probably be just fine.
675243,Fish4Eyes,2012-03-12 13:38:00,1022,"Like mentioned above, if charged before putting the boat away they are fine. I find my batteries are still full even when I do go to charge them up after a couple months."
675245,Rizzo,2012-03-12 13:41:00,4754,they are ruined...leave them at my house and I will look after them for you
