674399,misfish,2012-03-09 01:37:00,29133,"Ok theres a winner,but what was the answer Cliff?"
674413,bigugli,2012-03-09 02:05:00,6138,"Sturgeon, as in England, only the Crown may harvest them. A few years back an angler made a rare catch in a river and representatives of the royal household quickly visited the gentleman to claim his fish. Whales are also royal fish, although in fact mammals. Just as swans are the exclusive property of the Crown"
