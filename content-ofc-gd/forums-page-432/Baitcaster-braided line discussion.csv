665046,rufus,2012-02-09 21:48:00,267, With 30 lb Power Pro on my low profile bait caster just about all of the line comes off the spool when I cast. It goes a mile. If I went any lighter I wouldn't have any line to go further anyway. Perhaps that would be a consideration for you as well.
665050,boombap,2012-02-09 21:51:00,310," See, I can only manage a quarter of my spool IF that with 50 pound on this reel.. Ill definitely be trying out some 30 pound.. either the regular stuff or the super 8 slick."
665055,boombap,2012-02-09 22:01:00,310," I've tried them all, I have only used this reel 2-3 times with light lures.. Im sure something heaver would toss out some more line. A have a spinning reel that I can almost spool with the same lures I tried out.. it has 20# power pro."
674922,boombap,2012-03-10 21:05:00,310,"Here's a update on one of my braid setups.  I picked up a chronarch CH201E5 and paired it with my crucial crankbait rod. I love the setup, extremely light. I also picked up some power pro super slick #20 test. I spooled the reel last night and it seems that the line keeps digging in to the spool. Although I havent used it yet, I think I am going to face some problems when I do."
674933,Dabluz,2012-03-10 21:51:00,701,"  Those were independant tests carried out by Tackle Tour people about 10 years ago.  They did 5 or 6 tests on each line they had at the time and yes, Fireline was way stronger than the other lines.  They also tested abrasion resistance in those tests.  Mason Tiger braid won the abrasion tests.  Fireline on the whole behaved very well in those tests.  So, even if Fireline does not have a strong knot test, from what I have read, the knots do test out stronger than the rated breaking strength of the line.  Pretty well all the braided and fused lines have a knot strength around the rated strength of the line itself.  I'm sure that somebody will eventually make some new tests because most fishing lines have improved over the past 10 years.  I would bet my money on the fact that there are no really bad lines anymore.  It's now just a choice on whether or not you want a coated line or not, how well coated the line is, how the line is braided, how silent or slick it is etc."
675118,bucktail,2012-03-11 23:31:00,1857,"I find it interesting that people use braid smaller then 30lb on their baitcasters.  Line diameter is very important for braid on baitcasters, smaller then 30lb and the line with its smooth surface will bind down on to the spool resulting in some nasty backlashes that do not want to come out.  Something to consider when you spool up the baitcaster."
675125,Dutch,2012-03-12 00:18:00,831," I find that braid binds if it doesn't go on the spool tight.  Also - if there is a difference in casting distance with different braid ratings/diameters I don't think it would be all that significant.  Tip wrap isn't the fault of the the braid - it's the user 98% of the time.  Accuracy is a lot more important than distance, especially in bass fishing.  Frog fishing may need longer casts, but if you need more distance, just get a longer rod and make sure the lure rating is correct for the rod so the blank is loaded properly."
675130,Bassnbows,2012-03-12 00:35:00,58,"I use 30lb. Power Pro for most applications and have recently went to 20lb. Tracer Braid on a spinning reel for a test. Works great for casting Live Target Cranks, so sensitive and great for long casts. On sale now at CT."
675165,Dabluz,2012-03-12 02:25:00,701," I've never had trouble with line binding into the line already on the spool.  I use a very light drag.  I pump the rod otherwise, only the reel handle turns.  I use 18 lb test Mason Tiger braid on 2 baitcasters and have never had problems with line digging into the spool.  The strongest braid I use for softwater fishing is 30 lb test and this line is rarely used."
675177,BillM,2012-03-12 02:59:00,17367,"I never get line digging in on my baitcaster.  I run 20lb Suffix on my Calais, never an issue."
675215,MCTFisher9120,2012-03-12 11:38:00,3761,"I have my pitching rods for bass where I use 50lb braided Super Slick, then frog rods with 65lb braid. I am going to try and use 30lb braid on my 6'10MH/Calais. It's a spinnerbait rod mostly but would be good for a chatterbait or buzzbait rod too. I use 30lb braid here because it's plenty strong to pull fish to the boat, but it's a nice diameter of line at a 8lb line diameter vs the 12lb diameter of 50lb braid. That being said, they make Super Slick in 40lb braid also that has a diameter of 10lb mono. It's a nice in between and is just right.  30lb .28mm 40lb .32mm 50lb .36mm  I used the 40lb yesterday casting around some pike baits. It handled great and was very impressed with it."
675331,boombap,2012-03-12 18:10:00,310,Yesterday in my backyard I put a small 1/4 oz weight on my 7ft crucial/chronarch with 20# super slick and it casts a mile! Was very impressed. No line digging in the spool.. We will see when I throw heavier lures on there.
664751,boombap,2012-02-08 22:45:00,310,"DOS, I will keep that in mind!"
664755,EC1,2012-02-08 23:22:00,930,"There's far too many lines on the market for everyone to agree on one. I'd say have a budget for 2 different braids and try both..I'm pretty sure you'll like at least one of them. There's not very many bad braids out there...And even the braids that aren't so good, there are people that like them. I've hated on Duracast for the longest time because of its line diameter."
664764,rufus,2012-02-08 23:58:00,267,I have been using 30# Power Pro on a baitcaster for several years and love it. I have tried other brands but always ended up with problems. Power Pro is always problem free.  I used 60# Tuff Line XP on another reel for a few years with no problems. Good inexpensive line. I didn't like the lighter pound test Tuff Line though.  I have since moved up to 80# Power Pro on that reel now but still would not have a problem with using Tuff Line in the heavier tests.
664767,Dabluz,2012-02-09 00:21:00,701,"I like braid that does not have any extra stuff to make it slip or render it less limp.  Yes, the main reason that stuff was added to braid was the problem with tip wrapping.  However, the thinner and limper the braid is, the further it casts.  I have tried a bunch of braided lines and have switched them from spinning to baitcasting reels and back to spinning.  Oddly enough, I have never tried mono on a baitcaster.  Anyway, my favourite braid is Mason Tiger braid in 18 lb test.  I get great distance with this line.  Another line I like to use is Tuff Line....not the Ultra nor the XP or anything like that....just Tuff Line.  It has no added substance to make it less limp.  I don't have any problems with tip wrapping but I rarely leave enough slack line for this to happen.  I have used Spider Line and I still have 20 lb test Power Pro on one baitcaster.  They are both good.  In any event, most of my braided lines are 20 lb test except for the 18 lb test Mason Tiger Braid.  I have a 300 yard spool of Tuf Line (no additives) in 35 lb test (salt and pepper coloured) that I have in reserve.  The only braided lines I have thrown away since they came out is the Spider Line and Remington Braid that was junk.  I still have some original Gorilla Braid on a baitcaster and it works great.  The only braided line that I have come across has been the Remington Braid.  I think I paid about 4 dollars per spool on Ebay.  I gave it away and made a few people hate braided line....lol."
664774,rufus,2012-02-09 00:34:00,267,Just a comment about the difference between Tuf(F?) Line and Tuff Line XP. Tuff Line will dig into the spool rendering the spool unmoveable (usually too far in to fix) when the drag is set tight. Tuff Line XP does not.
664787,BillM,2012-02-09 01:10:00,17367," Most 20lb braid breaks around 30lbs, some over 40lb.  I dunno where you got your numbers but they don't seem very accurate.  I know I can easily snap 20lb mono, 20lb braid on the other hand takes a lot more effort.  "
664805,SirWhite,2012-02-09 02:26:00,210,"  lol, I disagree"
664806,BillM,2012-02-09 02:38:00,17367, 20lb mono with gloves?  Not a hard task.  Do you have to ask your mom to open the jam jars for you?
664807,salmon,2012-02-09 02:39:00,334," I was drawn in by the hype also I had it on several reels, now I am back to the regular Sufix perf braid. No tip wrap from this line."
664808,BillM,2012-02-09 02:40:00,17367,"Jose, the braid that was on the Calais I bought from you was great.  I think that was Suffix Performance braid if I'm not mistaken...  Great stuff."

The orange colour was garbage though, thing was frayed after a few trips  With the 20lb test being strong, I'm sure it is. But when you cast, with a quick or whip cast the line snaps like nothing lol. Prob is the way I cast, I've always used next to no braking and never thumb the spool and bomb the lure out. Have to be gentler with braid"
664837,SirWhite,2012-02-09 04:49:00,210," So you need gloves on than? Think that kinda proves my point, if you need to wear physical protection as to not create an injury.   "

664862,Roy,2012-02-09 11:54:00,13728, I agree.

I run 10lb power pro for trolling... I didn't break off all year... And I'm making contact with rocks...weeds...zebra mussles... Wood.... And landed some big musky by accident also...

664925,bigbuck,2012-02-09 15:24:00,2449,"A couple of things that everyone has seemed to ignore in this thread. Yes, a lighter line should get you further casts. Another thing to consider is making sure your reel and it's bearings are lubed nicely. I love Quantum HotSauce, it smoothed up my Abu 6500C4 musky reel and made it feel like something completely different. Another thing is possibly upgrading the bearings in your reels or even upgrading your reels. You didn't mention what kind you have. A $50 Canadian Tire Baitcaster is never ever going to cast anything like a Curado or more expensive."
664936,BillM,2012-02-09 16:14:00,17367, Did you only test two lines?  I'd like to see what 20lb Fireline Crystal fails at.

664609,boombap,2012-02-08 13:37:00,310,"Hi,  I was cleaning up my rods and tackle last night, jonesing for the soft water season to commence  I've always used 50# power pro braid on my baitcasters, but I feel that Im not getting enough distance on my casts. What are everyones experiences with using a lighter braid on a baitcaster? I was thinking of switching to 30# but just worried about backlashes.. since 30# braid is equivalent to 8# mono, right? How do you all decide on what # line to use? Technique? Species? Anyone input would be great.  Thanks  Edit: Also, are some brands of braided normally thicker than others with the same # test line?"
664612,mike rousseau,2012-02-08 13:51:00,4661,i normally use the heaviest line i can get away with... without effecting lure action of course... or dive depth...  im assuming your talking about bass set ups... wich is something i know little about... so thats all i can say about that...   ...
664616,Jer,2012-02-08 14:11:00,1426,"I use 50# Power Pro on my MH rod, but only 30# on my lighter medium action baitcasters with no issues. Backlashes occasionally happen, but usually it's user error.  Actual line diameter is usually listed on the box."
664634,EC1,2012-02-08 15:08:00,930,"I usually have 55# daiwa samurai on all my bc's. I think what you're looking for is a better casting braid. All of the 8 weave braids should be better in the casting dept, but check your line diameters before hand or make sure at the store. There's lines out there that are way thicker than they should be, some thinner(samurai is one of them). Samurai does break a little easier, so I dont recommend 40 for bc's. It will take a trip or two to get used to it, but I love that line."

664644,Live2fish85,2012-02-08 15:43:00,1633,As someone else said backlash is because of the user for the most part. If you adjust the spool tention accordingly to.all your lures you should be fine. I mean I get the odd birds nest on bot my baitcasters and its generally because I have a brain fart an do something dumb. Also if you are using a cheap baitcast reel your not going to be casting as far as someone with a higher end one. Regardless of the line one it. I know my Citica doesn't cast like my Curado or my friends Core. I don't think the line makes a difference on distance though. Never noticed any from 50# to 20# on the Citica.  Bill I agree with you about the Suffix 832 I couldn't stand it. On top of what ypu mentioned I found it frayed alot more as well and quicker.
664645,bigmac1984,2012-02-08 15:43:00,193,"To each their own I guess, I don't think brand really has anything to do with it.  I've used 15lb PP on my Medium action baitcaster without any issue. I agree with most posts saying that you should try as best you can to match the #test to the lure(s) you are using which typically matches the technique. I use 30# on one of my MH setups, and 50# on the other, and run 65# PP on both of my heavy setups. I find I do get some backlashes but its usually human error thats causing it, not the diameter of the line."
664648,BillM,2012-02-08 15:53:00,17367, I think the fact it got super limp when wet was why it was wrapping so badly.   I fish a lot of topwater and it was driving me insane.  It casts very good however.  Never had an issue with braid doing this before.
664650,backbay,2012-02-08 16:05:00,773,"I use braid ranging from 40to 80 lbs on my baitcasters, and don't have any complaints with casting distance, but I tend to throw heavier baits. Backlashes are pretty much always of my own doing, for sure. As far as diameter is concerned,I still have a spool of Sufix Performance Fuse 30 lb, on one of my baitcasters. It's almost as thick as the 80 lb Power Pro. Mind you, that line is older by a couple of seasons, and has seen a lot more action, so it's ""fuzzier"", but a thick line for its rated strength, for sure."
664654,Harrison,2012-02-08 16:09:00,2202,"Boombap, below is my braid setups.  30lb braid for spinnerbaits, topwaters, and basically any other horizontal type baits where you are casting.  However now I have gone back to 17lb mono or fluorocarbon when throwing the above.  50lb or 65lb braid is what I use for topwater frog fishing in heavy cover.  50lb for flipping and pitching  80lb for punching slop mats and dunking thick weedbeds.  You didn't ask about spinning, but I go with straight 20lb, doesn't matter what I am throwing when I use braid.  Backlashes are due to user error mostly. In time they slow down, but never go away.  I still get them, especially when there is a camera boat around or some folks watching from shore  Good Luck,  Phil"
664655,mercman,2012-02-08 16:28:00,7054,  X2 on the tip wrap. Switching back to PP this season also.
664665,Live2fish85,2012-02-08 17:04:00,1633, Same here if I am not out drop shottin I am generally in using top water in bays along Erie and I had the same problem. An yes it does cast better then power pro but not enough to counter the problems with it. Even if I am tossing spinners I found it to do the exact thing when you jerk the spinner. Stuff is just garbage other then casting. I also found the nanofil wasn't great other then for casting. Mind you nanofil is nice for icefishing.

664719,jedimaster,2012-02-08 20:47:00,3472,"The thinniner and lighter the line the further it will cast, as there is less resistance and weight. Also the smooth the line the further it will cast. the better the reel the further it will cast. Better guides etc... lots of factors to consider."
