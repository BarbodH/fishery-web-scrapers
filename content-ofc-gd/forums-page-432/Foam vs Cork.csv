674772,MJL,2012-03-10 04:24:00,2427,"Aside from cork on my float and fly rods, I could care less...The rest of the time my hand is on a hard plastic/graphite reel seat anyway.   Not to forget the wood filler used to fill in the pits and holes in the cheaper cork handles...A couple months later, you'll start to see it flaking out bit by bit."
674773,Muskieman,2012-03-10 04:28:00,2472,"I used to love my cork ....I loved the firmness and sensitivity ... but after holding my wet cork all day, my hand got itchy ..I had to rub my cork for relief... I after 15 years have since switched to foam .. It's softer,thicker and more slimy than the cork I love ... I may have an allergy to cork ... so,soft ,thick and wet are what I have to settle with.. My wife on the other hand ,loves it and can handle the cork, with both hands ... She's ambidextrous .  Randy "

674799,Alumacraft,2012-03-10 12:24:00,139,I know I tried to edit my post but could not figure out how to do it on my phone.

674809,OhioFisherman,2012-03-10 13:32:00,6623,"I thought I read somewhere that quality cork is in short supply? I have a mix, including some of the early 1980`s Shimano fighting rods? It`s a rod action thing for me more than what the handle is made of."
674811,Alumacraft,2012-03-10 13:38:00,139,Lew no problem . None taken.
674938,Dabluz,2012-03-10 22:04:00,701,"I guess we will have to resign to the fact that good cork handles will become rarer over the years.  Yes, there is a cork shortage...especially good quality cork.  There are some great new materials for rod handles and they are great to use.  I hated the first generations of foam handles and if I ever have to buy a rod with a synthetic handle, I sure will look it over real careful before buying it."
674942,danc,2012-03-10 22:13:00,4677, It's those damn wine drinkers causing this. Wine should be made illeagal until the cork supply rebounds.

674694,bucktail,2012-03-10 00:44:00,1857,I am starting to feel like an old man with my cork handled rods ( mostly Loomis and St Croix ).  Can someone who switched from cork to foam  please offer up there opinion on there likes and dislikes.  Is there any difference in sensitivity and more important handling in cold weather. I have a Core on the way and want it to be a part of a super light weight crankbait combo for smallies and such.    Thanks      Darren

674703,Gerritt,2012-03-10 00:54:00,6129,Foam is for kids.... cork is for men.
674706,Pigeontroller,2012-03-10 00:59:00,2793,"funny, I remember as a kid in the early 80s cork seemed to go out of fashion and everything went to foam...then back to Cork, foam,cork,foam,cork,foam"
674707,Live2fish85,2012-03-10 01:01:00,1633,Cork all the way.
674708,lew,2012-03-10 01:03:00,12766,I learned to fish with cork in the 50's and I'm still using it today. No sense in changing a good thing.
674709,Djeep,2012-03-10 01:03:00,199,I will always prefer cork but the foam on the new compre/crucials felt pretty nice compared to other foam handles
674710,kickingfrog,2012-03-10 01:06:00,8333,"Love cork. Hate the synthetic stuff.  My head is willing to allow that the today's synthetic stuff (not that foam junk from 25 years ago) is likely better, lighter, and more sensitive, but my heart does not care, and never will. In time I am sure my kids will snicker and make fun of me, but I will not waver."
674715,Sinker,2012-03-10 01:12:00,8692,"I find some of the newer foam handles hold up in rod holders better than cork does over time. My trolling rods are foam, the rest are all cork.  S."
674720,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-10 01:29:00,10439,Cork and if you want warmth cork flocked with nylon fibers!!
674736,jim,2012-03-10 02:04:00,124,There's nothing like the feel of cork in my hand. I think it's more sensitive and just feels right!
674741,MCTFisher9120,2012-03-10 02:19:00,3761,"I love cork but maybe it's just because cork handles ended up on all the G.Loomis and St Croix rods that I own. Doesn't mean I won't buy a Cumulus or Cumara, they feel and fish amazing. Anybody who won't fish a high end ""foam"" grip is crazy."
674744,Sinker,2012-03-10 02:25:00,8692,There used to be a member of this board who was allergic to cork. Her options for rods was limited to foam only.  S.

674750,Dan668,2012-03-10 02:44:00,1120,Cork for sure
674754,coreyhkh,2012-03-10 02:54:00,163,My first fishing rod was foam I still have it but I would never buy one. Cork all the way.
674757,jedimaster,2012-03-10 03:04:00,3472,"I have a cumara and I like the handle, but the foam feels weird in the rain. I wouldn't say slippery, just weird. I prefer cork. Howver the cumara I have is super sensitive."
674758,jedimaster,2012-03-10 03:13:00,3472,If a fishing rod and a cork handle costs 110 dollars together and the fishing rod is a 100 dollars more than the cork handle how much does the cork handle cost?
674763,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-10 03:28:00,10439,"  Not enough!! Good cork costs way more than $10 to build a handle!!! Really good cork is $3-$4 a ring. I have seen factory rods that look like they have nice cork handles, but when you start to disassemble the handle it's a cheap plastic cylinder with 1/8"" cork covering!!"
674765,jedimaster,2012-03-10 03:38:00,3472,10 dollars is not the answer to the riddle..... Try again.
674766,kickingfrog,2012-03-10 03:41:00,8333,   I'll need some more punctuation then.
674768,BillM,2012-03-10 03:43:00,17367,"I'll gladly pay extra for cork, I hate foam handles..."
674769,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-10 04:05:00,0,nothing worse than the feel of wet foam. cork all the way!
