244138,bigcreekdad,2008-08-28 12:36:00,546,"It's been awhile, but this is always fun. What are your favorite ways of frying fish, and what coatings do you like? Also, do you pan fry, deep fry, or saute? Also of importance is your preference of types of oil.  One of my favorites for pan or deep frying is simply to pat the fish in a plate of flour before frying. The difference is to mix thouroughly into the flour cayenne pepper....you can add as much as you want, but i like enough to so that the mixture has a pinkish tinge to each. Try it....it give this basic recipe a bit of a kick.  Damn, I'm getting hungry!"
244141,Greencoachdog,2008-08-28 12:40:00,8163,Fish dredged in in flour seasoned with garlic salt and pepper.. makes for a very light coating.  Peanut oil so hot it will ignite a match when dipped in it.  Deep or pan fried.
244156,TennesseeGuy,2008-08-28 12:56:00,957,"I'm a little off topic, but here's a hint.  I filter my peanut oil after each use and am able to get two weeks out of a gallon while feeding four people fish all but a day or two.  I'm not dealing with light eaters.  Talking about Whopper, Norton, Choo Choo, and JP, to mention a few from the board.  LipDip is probably the champ.  I give fish a buttermilk bath, then coat with Zatarain seasoned batter.  A thermometer is a must because I bring the oil temperature to 375 F. before dropping in the fish."
244246,Mike Pike,2008-08-28 17:27:00,1332,"Hey, funny that you mentioned that Tennessee cuz I filter my oil after frying some fish too.  Seems a shame to throw it all out when all ya have to do is put it through a strainer to get rid of the bigger pieces and then re-use it a few times.  Honestly I don't think there is any difference in flavour."
244250,TennesseeGuy,2008-08-28 17:40:00,957,"Yep, Mike, it's stays clear especially if I fry up a batch of French fries about Tuesday.  I try to use batter that sticks to the fish instead of gathering in the oil and burning.  Sometimes we fry a big pile of walleyes."
244253,bigugli,2008-08-28 17:53:00,6138,"Fried, deep fried or sauteed, makes no diff. All very yummy. Fave coating of others at the table would be my beer batter. It's amazing how many people will show up at my place for a pot luck fry.  As for the oil, it's whatever is on sale. Filtering is good, but it also needs to be clarified. As you finish cooking throw a few pieces of potato in before turning off the heat. Potatoes will absorb the residual flavours, juices, etc... that will make oil go cloudy with repeat use. With the crowd I feed that means taters to start. Followed by the main event. Finishing with a last batch of taters. I also like to take my left over batter, thicken it up with pancake flour, and make deep fried bannock. I was taught there is no waste in bush cooking.  Just thinking about this is making me drool."

244329,watertight,2008-08-28 22:29:00,50,Do not eat deep deep fried mars bars. It will lie in your stomach like a concrete block. And they don't taste that good anyway.
244332,bigugli,2008-08-28 22:36:00,6138,I'm still working on perfecting my recipe for deep fried coleslaw
244341,Zubris21,2008-08-28 23:12:00,563,"Personal favorite is pan fried in butter, or 1/2 butter 1/2 veggie oil.  For batter, I used to make my own but was recently introduced to using simply seasoned bread crumbs.  I was a little skeptical at first, but the seasoned (or italian) bread crumbs have a ton of flavour, and cook up nice and crunchy!"
244378,medmart,2008-08-29 00:47:00,587,I like mine with salt and pepper then fry in bacon fat  Rob
244380,jwl,2008-08-29 00:54:00,1056,"there's so many ways to prepare fish I don't even know where to start...not my profession now, but I worked as a chef for years, have had my papers for 20 years almost, and occasionally work for a catering company on weekends in the summer for the last 3 years as a way of making some fun money on the side.  For battered, like the Bigugli said...can't beat a simple beer batter..great pre-mix, just add beer is..Krusto...just had a good little fry with that at my trailer on Tuesday night (reprt to come tommorrow after work, noi time today..kid has been on the computer and just got off,gotta leave for work at 4 am so going to bed soon  )..I been to a few good pot luck cookouts with the Bigulgi bunch..we whip up a pretty darn good feed together  If anyone ever needs some good ideas for cooking up your fav fish or game, don't be shy, I know tonnes of recipes for just about anything that swims, crawl, runs,flies"
244623,modny,2008-08-29 18:57:00,502,i filter my oil afterwards and then dump it in my gas tank
244628,TennesseeGuy,2008-08-29 19:04:00,957,"Micro H, good move on putting oil to good use.  Are local fast food restaurants being friendly to you?  What vehicle are you using and what adjustments have you made to it?  Maybe you would start a new thread on this one.  I'd be interested."
