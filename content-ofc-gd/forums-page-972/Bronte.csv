243562,James007,2008-08-26 16:24:00,7,"heading out to the Bronte this friday to wet the line, with all the rain and cold nights, anyone think the salmon have started making their run up early this year? or has anyone headed down to the bronte already or the credit?  thanks guys"
243700,sharper,2008-08-26 23:16:00,279,I was at bronte last night. Many guys on the piers but nothing being caught.
243702,BabyHerc,2008-08-26 23:39:00,285,Salmon are in some GTA rivers...
243728,idesign,2008-08-27 01:16:00,149,Can you lets us know which rivers.thx
243738,GBW,2008-08-27 01:56:00,8460,That depends on how far North you are looking in the river.  Why don't you got for a walk with your gear to the rivers/creeks close to you and have a look see?  I know that up by me there is nothing yet but I know if I went South by 10KM or so I should find some...
243802,canadadude,2008-08-27 11:53:00,769,"Just starting off the piers now depending on the water temp, if it's warm nothing when it cools below 60 degrees the fish come in."
244018,idesign,2008-08-28 00:10:00,149, Went to Duffins Creek this morning  to check out but saw nothing moving yet.
244074,henryko,2008-08-28 03:30:00,41,"I was there on sun between 10-2. Got a hit or 2, but nothing land among about 10 ppl on both sides of the pier...."
244265,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-08-28 18:37:00,0,Checked Duffins Creek ... nothing yet  will go to Oshawa today .. wish me luck
244275,BillM,2008-08-28 19:04:00,17367,"Still a bit to warm, but these cold nights should move things along considerably."
244280,Marko,2008-08-28 19:12:00,854,"The biggest salmon run i have ever seen was in Owen Sound and the whole creek was full of dark salmon. It was so thick you could amost walk across the river on them and not get your feet wet. It snowed that day and it was really late in the season, week 6 or 7 in nfl i think."
244303,chickenhawk,2008-08-28 20:40:00,612,was fishing an eastern trib yesterday.....caught 3 and seen plenty more.....fish have already made their way uptop on that creek.....good luck
244308,l2p,2008-08-28 20:58:00,346,"^^ fish are in, just go look for them.  btw, if a fish dies of natural causes would person be able to keep the fish? i found atleast 6 dead females which were all fresh and full of eggs. figure just take those eggs so dont have a kill one."
244367,BillM,2008-08-29 00:27:00,17367,"I don't see why not, mind as well put the eggs to use...  They are going to do anyone any good rotting away in the river."
244816,CLofchik,2008-08-30 02:35:00,854," It's illegal to be walking around with just a bag of eggs, if a CO sees you it will be a fine ($110+Victim Surcharge Tax)  Ethically fine, but every roe raper & their brother (he's downstream with the net) would just claim ""but officer, I just found a dead hen and didn't want to waste the fish""."
244835,Rich,2008-08-30 04:59:00,3927,"The pinks are coming up some Lake Erie tribs now, won't be long before the others move in too."
