244301,JorgeCarlos,2008-08-28 20:31:00,109,"i would like to know what color senkos work best for bass on Quinte bay and what size hooks for whacky style, thanks a lot.  Jorge"
244305,chickenhawk,2008-08-28 20:50:00,612,bubblegum is one of my favourites.....you can never go wrong with white either....good luck...  Hawk
244309,GBW,2008-08-28 20:59:00,8460,# 91 - WATERMELON/CREAM WHITE
244315,singingdog,2008-08-28 21:32:00,1047,"There's only 3 colours of senkos: dark, light and in between  I would never head out without watermelon/black, white pearl, and one of the laminates. I use size 1 or 2 circle hooks for wacky rigging."
244334,mikeh,2008-08-28 22:45:00,824,"last weekend we used berkley 5 inch fat sinking worm in breen colour and the fish loved them, the water was fairly clear in the Kawarthas (Buckhorn)"
244350,canadian_copper,2008-08-28 23:45:00,925,BUBBLE GUM AND THE WAVE WORM BRUSIED ORANGE HAS BEEN LAYIN A BEATIN ON THEM AS OF LATE!!!
244366,BillM,2008-08-29 00:26:00,17367,"I've caught both smallmouth and largemouth on Yamamoto 5"" Senko's in bright green flake, along with pumpkinseed.  Natural in the clear water, a little brighter in the stained..  This is just what I've found so far this year"
244434,SBCregal,2008-08-29 05:51:00,688,"i like bubblegum, white, black, pumpkinseed"
244436,JorgeCarlos,2008-08-29 07:20:00,109,"Thank you guys, always so helpful,"
244439,Paully,2008-08-29 09:57:00,712,I was out on buckhorn last week... RootBeer senkos worked great
244465,charlesn,2008-08-29 12:15:00,551,"Is there a senko colour that a bass or pike will not eat?  lol  Charles  P.S.  The answer is no.  I own 30+ colours and have caught fish on every single one of them.  It's the ultimate ""no-brainer"" of a bait.  Quinte this weekend is going to be a bit busy and pressured though, there is a big tournament going on with potentially 100+ boats that will have also all pre-fished for a week.  I would recommend elsewhere for this weekend if you have a choice as you ""might"" (you also might not) find it a bit tougher than usual under these conditions for bass."
244539,BeRad3000,2008-08-29 15:16:00,65,"Never fished there, but iv done well with all the colors mentioned. White 5"" i find to be the best."
244546,FishingInTheDark,2008-08-29 15:45:00,25,has any one found colors that don't seem to work well?
244557,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-29 16:26:00,0,The water is deeper and murkier this year. Stick to dark colors.
