244392,Mattones,2008-08-29 01:58:00,587, aw no way thats gotta be harsh..  for a prank you should take his keys for the lock and remove the boat during the night. next morning record him shitting himself as he sees nothing but the chain on the driveway.  Though I am sure he wouldnt take you fishing for a while
