244732,mistyjr1,2008-08-30 00:45:00,97,"One of my goals for this year at Lakair was to keep my Lakair trips with a muskie streak going, the last two trips i had got 3.  This trip kept the streak going.  This was my first decent size muskie casting and I caught it on a the first bootail I made which is named the ""Gay Seagull"". Here she is a beautiful 40"" lakair musky there was not a single scratch on her...  And the release, i know she looks like she is belly up but i just put her in the water when Dad took the picture...   Thanks for reading, Corey"

244808,danc,2008-08-30 02:23:00,4677,"Congrats Corey. Beautiful fish. Chip off the old block, eh??"
244821,ehg,2008-08-30 02:39:00,2666,Real nice fish
244829,Joey,2008-08-30 03:12:00,9122,"That's just awesome Corey, way to go bud.  Nice looking ski there.  On your own lure too, that's fantastic.  Joey"
244845,b2kptbo,2008-08-30 10:52:00,1505,"Nice healthy looking Muskie Corey, WTG..."
244851,Greencoachdog,2008-08-30 11:45:00,8163,"Is it just me?... or does it look like Lew passed his fish around the boat for everybody to have their pic taken with it?  Just messin with ya Corey!  An Excellent fish and I'm jealous as hell!!!  I'm guessing the Gay Seagull had some pink on it? A lot of Fishermen are afraid to use pink because of what others might say, but it is a darn good fish catching color under certain conditions... especially when the water starts to cool off! I know a certain lure maker that is scared to death to even buy pink paint!!!... but that's ok, more for us eh Bubba!!!  Congratulations on a beautiful fish and catchin' it on one of your own lures!!!"
244868,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-30 13:24:00,0,WOW! Another nice Musky from Lakair. It must be a great feeling to land a fish like that on your own homemade lure. Good job!
