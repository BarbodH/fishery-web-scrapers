244418,scuro,2008-08-29 03:45:00,386,Great report but where is the Kesagami guide report!!!?
244425,Ramble,2008-08-29 04:26:00,713,"Thanks for the compliments....my camera is just and old Nikon Cool Pix i've had for years.  The Kesagami report wont be around for a while. i dont have all the photo's yet, and it takes weeks to write, its not a couple hours like this one. It'll probably be done some time between the 1st snow, and the spring thaw lol.  Hope this blurry picture will hold you over.  -R-  "
244428,Cookslav,2008-08-29 04:52:00,1457,Thats a heck of a report!  The flora and fungi pics are just unreal!!!! Algonquin holds a special place in my heart...thanks for sharing your trip.
244441,Paully,2008-08-29 10:07:00,712,Cool underwater shots. What kind of camera do you use?
244443,lunkerbasshunter,2008-08-29 10:58:00,2585,wow what a great report!  Thanks for taking te time  cheers!

244089,Ramble,2008-08-28 06:05:00,713,"  We weren’t back for long, when the rain set in again. We were warm and dry by this point. So we had an early supper and packed a few things for the trip out the next day before heading to bed.  When we awoke, the air was down right cold. We found out later it had gone down to about 5 Celsius that night, and frankly it felt like it. Thankfully it was clear and sunny…but I could have done without the breeze blowing. We donned our warmest gear, packed up and headed for home. Fishing along the way of course.  I came across this guy within the 1st half hour of the paddle out.   Booth Lake Dam   The portage out of Booth, was standing room only, and a cluster of canoeists prepared for the portage. We passed straight on by to the dam. Here we fired up the Coleman stove and ate the better part of a loaf of bread with peanut butter and jam for breakfast.  Afterwards we portaged over and shot the rapids down to the bottom. The high water made the trip faster, and easier then usual. Although that’s about as much water I’d like to be in the river with heading down stream.  Once at the bottom, the people had just got into their canoes after the portage. I must say…I prefer our way better…if only for the toast.  We headed on to the access point without a lot of action. We took our time and enjoyed the paddle.  We saw some nice water lilies in the morning sun.     I tossed the torpedo a bit with limited success. So I switched a favorite crank bait I’ve had for years, and found a small pike.    We continued on and an eagle graced us with its presence.   Before we were done we found a couple smallies, all on top water.   For one of them I busted out the water proof camera case and went to work. I managed these pictures, which I am quite proud of.        We packed the vehicle fairly fast, and had the usual 40 minute chat with the access attendant about all things wildlife and weather.  The trip ended up being a success despite the toughest fishing we have had since we started going, and the ever changing weather. I lost a lot of fish this trip. It seemed that I was getting every 3rd fish to the boat, no matter what I did. I switched between braided and 10 pound mono with no difference in the outcome. I switched baits, and played with drag. The fishing gods were not in the mood to make it simple it seems.  All-and-all we had a blast and accomplished everything we wanted to do. Can’t wait for next year.  Tight lines  -R-    "

I've never seen half of the plant life you captured, nice to learn something new.  The fishing shots were great as well, love the underwater shots.
