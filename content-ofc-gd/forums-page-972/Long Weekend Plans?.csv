245088,KelfuN,2008-08-31 06:57:00,246,possibly heading up to the grand on monday.
245089,Jonaton,2008-08-31 07:11:00,72,"Looks like we are heading to scugog instead of sturgeon, still looks like a beautiful day maybe not so good for the fishing though."
244674,ccmtcanada,2008-08-29 21:55:00,7971,"Well, hard to believe it's the Labour Day weekend already!  What do you have planned?  For much of Ontario, it's looking to be the picture perfect weekend.  Light winds, temps in the mid 20's and no rain in the forecast.  A slight cold front is coming through today, but only affecting the temps by a few degrees.  Bly and I are going to try to head back to Sturgeon Lake on Saturday....and then a camping night in the backyard with the little one in our tent.  Have a great long weekend everyone...looking forward to the reports.  Be safe on the road and on the water!"
244678,Bernie,2008-08-29 22:04:00,3190,Last weekend of the summer but going to make the best of it. Looks like great weather coming here too. Today I dug a trench for an outside phone jack at the cottage. Just to be able hook up the laptop in the great outdoors on nice days. The seadoo might get a good workout with the kids. Have to attend the Powassan fall fair on Sunday afternoon. I'm the pit crew for the two cars we have entered in the demolition derby. That's a fun time. Just may go fishing a couple times too.
244680,JohnF,2008-08-29 22:12:00,3494,"No fishing. Was hoping to get out to the river this evening but business stuff got in the way. Golf and theatre with friends from T.O. Saturday, then off to Cleveland on Sunday morning for a few days.  JF"
244681,oldphart,2008-08-29 22:13:00,665,"~~~~Lady Simcoe on Sunday, looken for some Deep water Jumbos"
244683,Wild,2008-08-29 22:25:00,704,Nice weekend although I will be stuck in the office and shop most of the time looks like a BBQ is now in the plans  
244684,JeffBornFishin,2008-08-29 22:26:00,260,"Plan is to fish the next three days.  Usually by lunch time each day the tri lakes are a write-off because of heavy boat traffic, sea-doos, wakeboarders and general bad boating behaviour.  The water ends up having a chocolate milk consistency.  So early am and late evening tends to be more sane.  Not impressed, I didn't get around to filling the gas tank on the boat and now the price here is $1.30/Litre.  Bend over  Good luck everyone and stay safe out there!"
244685,canadian_copper,2008-08-29 22:27:00,925,PUTTIN THE LUND IN ON HER MADIEN VOYAGE SUNDAY ON SCUGOG. FISH WILL JUST BE A BONUS THAT DAY!!!

244696,fishnsled,2008-08-29 23:10:00,3520,"Well I'm still at work   but on the bright side the traffic should be over when I leave.

244715,ccmtcanada,2008-08-30 00:05:00,7971, I'll look for the boat for sure!  We have two Ontariofishing.net stickers on our boat...one on the bow and one near the stern....same thing goes for you ok?
244716,tdotfisherman,2008-08-30 00:07:00,317,"3 Days on Georgian Bay.. The last time I went up the fishing was tough.. too many largemouth bass, not enough smallies and pike.. I like fish that actually fight, not just flop around when they are hooked.. hopefully the fishing this weekend is a bit better.. I'm currently in Salmon mode, so i'll have to tone it down a bit for the bay.."
244725,mikeh,2008-08-30 00:24:00,824,"either Scugog,Sturgeon or Buckhorn on Saturday we usually decide in the morning and  Georgian Bay (Victoria Harbour) on Sunday as the weather forecast is for 5km winds, have a safe weekend everybody"

That makes today/tonight our campout in the backyard day.  Our little one still wants to catch fish, so we are headed somewhere for some shore panfishing around lunch."
