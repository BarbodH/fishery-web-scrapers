244598,Joey,2008-08-29 17:55:00,9122,"Well Goolllleeeeeee, I feel special alright.  Maybe she likes sitting in coolers too, since she read my profile and says we have alot in common."
244599,danbo,2008-08-29 17:56:00,2646,"Gee, I never get any good ones like that..just hate mail in mine!!"
244600,Gerritt,2008-08-29 17:57:00,6129,Give them your full mailing address! They want to send you millions! and you get to keep 15%! if you forward the rest back to them in Camaroon!  G
244601,Joey,2008-08-29 18:00:00,9122," Ya, I usually get those in emails tho Gerritt, not PM's from a member.  But I do have hope that the emails I answer and send my bank account info to will come through one of these days  Joey"
