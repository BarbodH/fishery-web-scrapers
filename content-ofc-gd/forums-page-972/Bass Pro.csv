244475,Wild,2008-08-29 12:35:00,704,"BPS seems to have such low regard for the Canadian shopper in the first place, the web site and printed catalogs are focused on US customers and all pricing is in US funds. If you notice in the latest BPS ""Toronto"" flyer the tailgate sweepstakes is open to legal residents of the US and district of columbia. So we should shop at BPS why?"
244479,JPD,2008-08-29 12:52:00,296,"Why are so many people on this board so intent on taking a shot at BPS all the time? BPS does support Canadians by employing more of them than all of the tackle stores in Canada combined. They also donate more to local fishing and conservation clubs than anyone.  To say that they have the same selection as Le Baron's is ludicrous. It's not even close. Le Barons does have better pricing on some things but has no where near the store, selection, employees, tank, seminars or bills to pay. Let's try to compare apples to apples here.  As for BPS.. I have never seen another store get more people interested in fishing than BPS. There are more and more people enjoying this great sport because of the look of the store and the ease of it all. This is not to bash any other store because I have friends who own fantastic stores like Fishing World, Angling Outfitters, Angling Specialties and Gagnon's and they all do a great job. They will also reap the rewards of newbies being introduced into the sport by BPS.  The sheer fact that BPS doesn't rock bottom their prices like Walmart does should speak volumes of their integrity. They easily have better buying power than anyone else but still choose not to try and eliminate the competition by trying to starve everyone else. BPS also has supported quite a few individuals from this board and have never expected anything in return. I think they have been an asset to this industry and I am very grateful they are around.  If you get the chance, go see the store. It is incredible. My jaw dropped by the amount of taxidermy and the sheer size of it all. It is a work of art.  Regards  JP"
244490,Beans,2008-08-29 13:17:00,3339,"You should visit a Bass Pro Shop at least once in your lifetime just for the experience...try to make it on a visit to Florida...  Same could be said for Cabela's I guess...  I get to go to Vaughan once in a while as our family doctor is still in Richmond Hill and that is only a twenty minute drive further...no way would I drive the 2 1/2 hours to BPS only...Hell, I don't drive to Lindsay or P'boro unless it is for several items at today's gas prices...  Like I said it is an experience..."
244494,Roy,2008-08-29 13:28:00,13728,JP said it all but was a little more polite than I would have been.
244496,Wild,2008-08-29 13:33:00,704, People are allowed to voice their opinion besides most business owners or corporations take such criticism in a constructive way to improve their service and customer relations do they not? When more than a few consumers voice negative opinions then it's time to take notice and deal with it. While no business is perfect the successful ones do pay attention to the details of their customers. Enough said?
244498,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-29 13:43:00,0,"To me BPS is like the Fisherman's disney world. Its like the Spring fishing show that is open all year round. Lots to see. And it has a big tank filled with some really nice fish.  The prices are competitive. Seeing that the rent there is crazy. But when they have sales, there are some major savings.  Its close to my house(10-15 minutes) and watched it being built, and visit it very often.  The only complaint I have is that sometimes they are low on quite a bit of stock. Apparently, the minute they come in they are sold out again. You'd think they'd learn and buy more, but I guess they work on a budget like everyone else.  I'm not sure I would drive 4 hours to see the store, but if I was ever in the area, I would definitely stop buy. When I was in Windsor years ago, I just had to drive to Auburn hills Michigan and take a gander and I was really glad I did."
244517,fishinggeek,2008-08-29 14:31:00,325," Sorry, I was the one saying the selection is comparable.  I should've worded it better.  They comparable for the things I buy.  I know both stores and catalogues inside out, and for the items I buy, they're comparable.  My perspective's a bit selfish then, and I admit BPS has more distinct items than Le Baron, but those extra stuff are things I tend not to be interested in.  I'm not sure that their high prices mean they have ""integrity"".  The fishing retail business definitely has traits of an oligopoly, and I suspect BPS is playing a smart game of differentiating themselves with their big box/fish tank/etc experience, and using this to capture more of the consumer surplus.  I am loyal to no store.  I pick what I want, and find the best price.  If I knowing pay more for the exact same item at one store, this goes against the ""law of one price"" and is inefficient to me.  By knowing paying more for the exact same price, this implies some people might get some utility out of shopping at a particular store, for whatever reason, and are willing to pay for this utility.  Like I said, I can get all the experience I want out of the fish tank, the decor, or whatever, without having to pay a cent.  I'd buy my tackle in an alley if it was cheaper.  Like most people, I work hard for my money, and I'd rather not leave any of it ""on the table""."
244525,TennesseeGuy,2008-08-29 14:51:00,957,I'm hurting for a week or two of fishing at my favorite fishing hole in NW Ontario.  It's a little under 1500 miles one way.  And double that figure for the round trip.  I've been home 26 days from my last fishing trip to the same spot.  Using the logic that's being spread on this thread I could make it a really complicated decision and bring all sorts of opinions into the mix.  To do that would be ridiculous.
244528,BeRad3000,2008-08-29 14:55:00,65,"Really cool store, but after a 3 hour drive it probally won't stand up to it's reputation. Id wait till i was in the area.   Really cool store though."
244545,Wild,2008-08-29 15:38:00,704,"I must add some positives about BPS though, their customer service reps all are top notch.  And by the way an new Canadian store will be opening up and I believe it will be in the Montreal area."
244550,blarg,2008-08-29 15:56:00,289,"I drove in to vaughn mills from North bay a couple weeks back, and if you love to fish you gotta go to bps at least once. There was nothing i had ever seen or heard of that wasn't there, and about a million things that i hadn't seen, i didnt spend much, but it was worth the trip just to walk around it imo.  We didnt go specifically for bps, my wife wanted to go shopping, and the mall has alot of stores for the ladies as well."
244659,Silo Buster,2008-08-29 21:11:00,81,I rather support my small local shops.  Thumbs up to the small bizz owners.
244705,Cudz,2008-08-29 23:45:00,2652,I like the small biz as well and I do support my local but I have been to BPS 6 times this summer and I always buy something.  They have specialty stuff that you often can't find elsewhere (eg. tungston drop shot weights etc.).  Best fishing store in these parts for sure.
244837,Stern Rules,2008-08-30 06:05:00,342,"I would definately say it is well worth the drive, except the Toronto traffic. I'm an hour away and I make the trip at least 10 times a year! Good thing I'm rich. You'll be like a kid in a candy store.    The mall is nice too but I don't usually go anywhere else except Bass Pro. Be prepared to stay awhile and have lots o' cash. Bababooey!"
244889,Rich,2008-08-30 14:37:00,3927,"BPS, I'd say no.. if your wife likes malls however, the mall attached to it may be her cup of tea. It's huge!"
244918,Mark Kulik,2008-08-30 17:27:00,348,"I do most of my fishing tackle shopping at smaller places, Fishing World, JB's, angling Outfitters, mainly because I know them, they have become my freinds, I like to support smaller Canadian stores, however I concur with JP on the side of Bass Pro- just the huge high-profile place it is draws people to fishing that would otherwise never go into a tackle store, thats what we need in Canada, before we had a store in Vaughn my wife and I drove to Auburn Michigan, it was a cool experience, as well as a nice getaway for us both, as far as the Vaugn store, I really enjoy going in to just clear my mind and talk to enployees who have become my freinds, my kids love it there also, while I dont buy a lot of tackle anymore, I find they hve really good clothing , marine , shoes etc.. that I buy, I believe that Bps is drawing more first-time anglers into our sport which is good, this will also benefit our smaller stores in the long run.So don't go there thinking that you will save a ton of money, but go for the experience."
244931,Wild,2008-08-30 18:34:00,704,A quick question about JB's is it a good place to shop? Unfortunately I never  get the chance to drop in.
244942,Mark Kulik,2008-08-30 19:10:00,348,"Yes Wild, I think it is , good selection, and some hard-to find things too, lots of Musky, bass, steelhead and salmon gear."
245021,Wild,2008-08-31 01:06:00,704,Thanks Mark I  will have to make an effort to visit the store then.
245046,BillM,2008-08-31 02:20:00,17367, Bring your wallet.. I can't seem to go in there and leave empty handed
245058,bigugli,2008-08-31 02:58:00,6138,I have yet to meet the angler who can walk out of a tackle shop empty handed.
245060,salmon,2008-08-31 03:15:00,334,"Bill Stop it your killing me man. Want to buy another reel? LOL I have the Avid 10 1/2 Ft casting rod on order, mating up to a Calcutta 200GTB Jose"
245063,Wild,2008-08-31 03:23:00,704,"Actually I did walk out of BPS and in fact le Baron this year after finding they did not have the items I wanted in fact that would have been a rather large purchase. I wonder if Cabela's will decide to set up a store here, looking through their online catalogs today and they have quite the selection"
243826,cranks bait,2008-08-27 13:29:00,721,"So being that I am boatless for a few weeks, and the long weekend is coming up.  I am going to be one bored fisherperson.  My wife has suggested going to BPS (and the other stores there).  Neither of us have been.  Is it worth a 3-4 hour drive one way to go check it out?  Don't really need anything, and will be a LeBaron Saturday as we will be in Ottawa."
243830,Spiel,2008-08-27 13:42:00,9065,....Considering the drive time and the fact you don't need anything I'd say NO! Spend the savings on fuel over at LeBarons since you'll be there .
243831,bigugli,2008-08-27 13:54:00,6138,"If its about dollar value and road time, I would say no. At an hour's distance I go twice a year.  Just keep in mind the saying ""if mamma ain't happy, nobody is happy"". Treat it as an adventure. Lots of neat toys and eye candy."
243833,goodtimer,2008-08-27 13:56:00,53,"yeah that's a long haul.  wait till you need some gear and then go.  definitely go check it out at least once though.  but i guess if you really have nothing else to do just go for it.  you can easily kill 4-5 hours in there and if you're at all interested the rest of the mall is pretty huge.  even though you don;t NEED anything, be prepared to spend some cash!"
243834,Rombo,2008-08-27 13:59:00,39,Don't you need a new boat ? If so the trip is worth it
243836,Headhunter,2008-08-27 14:02:00,5703,"TO my mind, it's only worth it if Rogers is working! Heck of a drive to see virtually the same things as you will find at LB's. And from a pricing perspective, you may find things cheaper locally. However, that being said, if you in the market for clothing, BPS is virtually 2nd to none in that department... I find their fishing department to be the same as any other fairly large retailer. On the other hand, if you wife is a ""shopper"", than Vaughn Mills mall is her Utopia! And as mentioned above, Momma happy, daddy happy! If you do go, make it a point to see if Roger (BPS Bassman is his board name)is working... you will know if it's him, he's the guy that walks around with a huge smile on his face all the time, because you know what, he likes his job and more importantly, he like fishing people! HH"
243849,cranks bait,2008-08-27 14:45:00,721," New boat is being made, going to be another few weeks before I get it.  As for the shopping, that is what I am scared of.  Still need to pay for that boat."
243851,danbo,2008-08-27 14:51:00,2646,"I'd go to Hull, Quebec instead & go bar-hopping!"
243852,ccmtcanada,2008-08-27 14:53:00,7971,"Unless you have other things to do locally in the Toronto area, I'd say skip the trip to BPS.  I live an hour from it and maybe go there 2 times a year."
243854,John,2008-08-27 14:55:00,2956, IMHO probably not. Why not head down to Watertown NY and hit Gander Mountain. Have lunch or dinner in Sackets Harbor on the deck at the historic Maddison Barracks Inn?
243873,fishinggeek,2008-08-27 15:59:00,325,"If you're already going to Le Baron, you'll find they have comparable selection and much better prices than BPS.  But if you want to see a spectacle, like their fish feeding, along with a mall attached to it, BPS can be entertaining.  I rarely buy anything from BPS but I go there for the experience.  I save a lot of money from going to Le Baron."
243875,Zubris21,2008-08-27 16:05:00,563,"  I was also going to suggest this, and if you about 2 hours further there is a bass pro shop just outside of Syracuse."
243881,Cudz,2008-08-27 16:26:00,2652,This came as a bit of news to me but apparently Hull is now officially called Gatineau.  I think.  Re. the trip. Vaughn Mills shopping center is very good.  Wonderland is right there too so if you make a full day of it and if the wife likes to shop I would say YES.
243884,mikeh,2008-08-27 16:36:00,824,"Bass Pro Shops has a way bigger selection than Lebaron's, but I wouldn't drive that far to go there. Shop online and save the gas money."
243892,ketchenany,2008-08-27 17:03:00,3229, I live 5 minutes away from it and have only been 2 times since it opened!
243913,maybe,2008-08-27 18:17:00,307,"I'd say go...but think of BPS as a museum.  You might pick up a few little things in the gift shop, but it's really just about wandering around enjoying the decor.  On your way over, you might want to stop in at Gagnon's.  They're ridiculously convenient from the 401, and they've got skids of stuff I've never seen at Bass Pro or LeBaron's.  You'll find the price tags can be kind of scary on big items, but may deflate if you ask.  Note:  the Park Rd exit was recently removed - you'll need to take Stevenson Rd.  For your wife, BPS is on the way to the Cookstown Outlet Mall and the 400 Market.  Cookstown is stuffed full of designer outlet stores, as opposed to Vaughan Mills being mostly regular retail pricing.  The Market is 105,000 square feet - flipping massive.  The building's divided into 2 halves, part flea market (decent), and part antique mall (spectacular!).  As far as interesting shopping in Vaughan, there are lots of factory outlet stores sprinkled around.  Lots of designer stuff cheap, if you know where to look.  Have your wife take a spin through Shoestring Shopping for a heads up on what's really interesting in Toronto and the GTA.  It's an amazing resource."
243921,cranks bait,2008-08-27 18:47:00,721," Good grief.  We'd only go for one day and with a limited budget at that.  You think I would tell my wife about these places?   I sure sure hope she doesn't read this.  Thanks for the tips.  I know she wants to go more than I do.  Yes she loves to shop, and see new places.  I'm the lucky one that gets to drive."
243945,bigugli,2008-08-27 19:55:00,6138," Ahh, the sounds of wedded bliss. Cash registers ringing and the husband crying 'why me?' Remember the three golden rules of marriage: Yes dear. No dear. Anything you say dear. Your ticker will last a lot longer."
243946,Fang,2008-08-27 19:56:00,1330,Not worth the trip  Save the $ in gas and treat yourself to a guided trip somewhere and for something you don't normally get a chance to fish for
243953,steverowbotham,2008-08-27 20:07:00,1800, Hey I think I do a pretty good job also!  I work Monday to Friday til 2pm
243993,bassfighter,2008-08-27 21:28:00,366,"Sign up at Basspro.com, and they have better deals than the store, They will bombrd you with their sale almost twice a month as US economy is not good this year.  Bass pro is for your eyes only, nice to visit it for the fun of seeing a huge fishing store with tons of fishing stuff, and then you will be turned off by their prices.  It is a good place to check out products such as reel and rods, and then buy them at ebay or other US on line retailers."
243996,Wild,2008-08-27 21:53:00,704,"I drive by every thurs or Fri stopped in once this year and bought nothing, plenty of people in there though. When they get serious with Canadian catalogs and fair prices then we will see... Meanwhile order a catalog or two and start building your want list"
243998,forrest,2008-08-27 22:00:00,1032,"Casting another vote for ""not worth it"".  The fish tank is cool and if you get there on the day they have a sale on big items you want then it feels good.   But 4 hours to get there?  nah.  Shop online with Lebaron's and BPS.   forrest"
244422,gb charters,2008-08-29 04:11:00,4,"My suggestion is to support your local Canadian owed tackle shops and they will continue to be there when you need them. Or, keep buying from the big USA companies and you may be sorry in the long run..  Support Canadian!!!"
