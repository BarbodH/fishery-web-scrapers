244357,Bass Tard,2008-08-29 00:07:00,128,"Hey all, I started dating a girl in the winter who is really new at fishing, but to humour me she's been comming out with me a lot.  Its great, she's a trooper through 8+ hours of fishing as long as I'm up for it.  I pretty much always use baitcasters.  I like to fish for largemouth and pike, so I'm usually in heavy cover, and pretty much any other water I fish I use my ultra light setup because its just so much fun.  So, I don't really know what to set her up with?  I try and find deeper water and let her use jigs a lot because its easy.  Right now she's borrowing my OLD Shimano Spirex 4000 with 10lbs test on it.  It seems to work okay, but its a big reel and after a long day of fishing she'll complain about the weight a few times.. So I need to replace that reel, but I don't know what to do.  Nex summer I'll just train her on one of my old baitcasters, but right now she still has a lot of ""oops"" casts, and it would be a major PITA if she was on a different reel than spinning.  So, what are your simple bassin' setups?  What kind of reel, what kind of line?  Thanks!"
244364,BillM,2008-08-29 00:24:00,17367,"Shimano Sahara 2500FB, along with a Clarus 7ft medium action rod.  Some 6lb mono or braid would be good.  Keep it simple if she is a first timer (Also expect this rod to maybe end up at the bottom of the lake)  "
244368,bigugli,2008-08-29 00:28:00,6138,"For just starting out keep it simple. A decent $50 mid range reel spooled with 6 -8lb. mono on a medium light rod. Maybe a 6' Uglystick Light because they handle the abuse a novice can dish out on equipment. My wife of 20 years is still a novice, and boy does she punish the gear.  Just remember to breath deep and smile."
244382,Wild,2008-08-29 01:02:00,704,Dude you have to take her to a fancy store and let her pick out what she wants and what she is happy with ...        Or there may not be 'next summer'
244383,maybe,2008-08-29 01:07:00,307,"I'm using a Shimano Sedona 2500 RB.  Good price, light enough to run all day, and rear drag adjust is a thing of beauty.  I'd buy another in a heartbeat.  As for line, Rapala Titanium 30lb braid.  The Power Pro on Jeff's rods is fine, too.  Either way, this gal doesn't need to worry about birdsnests from mono's memory, or lost lures when she panics and the wussy line snaps.  Leave those ""perks"" for later when she's an old pro and in the mood for aggravation.  I've got a cheap Berkley Enforcer rod I picked up at Crappy for I dunno...$25-ish?...2 years ago.  It's a poster child for Viagra, but the handle makes up for it.  It's a big foam thing, with no sharp trim pieces, and no huge gap over top of the reel.  You wouldn't believe how hard that is to find.    I know it looks like heck, but it's supremely comfy, and the foam surface kind of grips you back.  Makes keeping control of the rod very low effort, even soaking wet.  Jeff's expensive cork handled rods take about 10x the work, even though they're lighter.  Just thinking that might be part of your girlfriend's ""weight"" complaint.  Either way, congrats on finding a gal who'll come out with you.  Hope she finds a setup that really fits her well!"
244409,bfong07,2008-08-29 02:50:00,13,"Shimano Stradic 1500 St Croix Triumph 6'6"" ML 15lb PP  Handles like a dream. Entire setup weighs less than 12oz. No fatigue after a 8+ hr day.The $200 price tag will let her know she's something special, lol."
244412,Bass Tard,2008-08-29 03:08:00,128,"Thanks, good advice so far..  I'm not sure that I want to spend a whole lot of money on a setup for her when I'm not too sure how much she's going to get into it.  I mean I think I should get a decent entry level spinning reel for $70ish tops.  The Shimano looks good, I've always like their reels, both my spinning setups are made by them.  Power pro is a braided line?  I know lots of people on here seem to love it, I really love my monos.  But for her, maybe a braid would be better.  I found I missed a lot of fish with them because I was so used to the mono stretching, I guess she wouldn't have to un-learn that.  Also, I just picked her up a new rod the first time we went out, she was using my Quanutm Energy spinning reel and broke it the first time out!  I tried to fix it and my trolling motor fugged up while I was looking at the broken reel all compfuzzled.  Off to bass pro I guess.."
244449,Victor,2008-08-29 11:15:00,1609,"it sounds like the reel's the thing that needs to be replaced? If everything else is working fine, downsizing the reel should make her day alot more comfortable.  I have experiences with quite a few Shimano reels and I'm happy with all of them ... she'll probably do fine with the Sedona as Adrianne mentioned above, very smooth reel for the price. Even though I've got my Saros and Symmetre now I'd still use my Sedona if I didn't throw it into the lake last year ..."
244509,BillM,2008-08-29 14:05:00,17367,"Could always go down in size to the 1500RB or even the 750RB, if she finds the reel a bit big.   I doubt she'd get spooled even using the 750 UL setup...."
244511,Billy - Curtiss,2008-08-29 14:13:00,241,I picked up a Pflueger President in and around the $70.00 range and it is super smooth and light weight and I haven't had any problems with it as of yet.  http://www.pfluegerfishing.com/products/products.php?p=12
244520,Raf,2008-08-29 14:33:00,3495,"Like mentioned, keep it simple.  a 1500, 2000 reel will be plenty for bass and hammerhandle pike and will be very light.  My opinion, stick with mono on a spinning reel for a newbie.  8lb test.  Shimano & Daiwa both make nice spinning reels for under 100.  I'd stick with those, my preference lies with the latter."

Iv got the same reel combo'd with a BPS rod, im very impressed. So smooth! Got the combo on sale $99 excellent value."
244556,Canuck2fan,2008-08-29 16:22:00,1444,Get her an Ugly stick or Pfleuger trion and a President Pflueger reel..... If you go to LeBaron's and let her try the President against any other reel up to double the price she will PICK the President. It is the easiest to turn reel out there for the money and very durable as well. After her using the Pflueger everything else will feel like grinding silverware in the garbage disposal especially similarly price Shimanos!!!
