244086,Cudz,2008-08-28 05:07:00,2652,I caught a 19 the other day on simcoe and it weighed almost exactly 4 pounds so yours will be heavier than that.
244177,bucktail,2008-08-28 13:51:00,1857,"Simcoe smallie can range alot in weight during the season, If she was very thick she could be in the 5.5 area or if she was thin as low as 4. 8 weeks from now she might even be able to push the 6lb mark when they really pork up."
244178,ccmtcanada,2008-08-28 13:53:00,7971,Yep...length alone doesn't really tell much.   You'll need a girth measurement as well.
244226,Fisherpete,2008-08-28 16:27:00,1814,"This 20 incher I caught at Rice Lake last summer was 4.2 lbs. It was not a super thick fish, didn't have that 'football' look like some of them get in the fall. The one in the first picture was 16"", just for comparison. I rarely weigh any fish these days, but the 20"" was (and still is) the longest smallie I have caught, so I took a weight out of curiosity.  16""   20""   Here's my biggest by weight - 19.5"", just under 5lbs. Caught last October, and FAT.  19.5"", 4.9lbs  "
244576,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-29 17:13:00,0,A 20 inch Simcoe smallie would be usually in the 4.5 to 5 lb range.
244582,snagmaster,2008-08-29 17:34:00,250,"I agree with johny...I caught a bunch this year that were 20""...probly around 4.5 depending on how thick she was..."
244722,love2fishhave2work,2008-08-30 00:20:00,212, that is what i figured.  thanks for the help.
