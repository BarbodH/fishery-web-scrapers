Great Day out there today Dave....hopefully you landed a mamoth on the fly rod after I left !!   The one I landed causing a catastrophic failure....   The release...  And what she left me with when all was said and done !!!! How's Okuma's warranty ?? Hopefully they are forgiving !! Hey Urban Angler, I am gonna need a copy of the recipt for the rod if you still have it, LOL !! "

244976,DMASSE,2008-08-30 21:34:00,420,"Dave  Thanks for the day.   Its was great.  After you left we stayed in that spot  and hooked into tons of fish.  I think between the 4 of us there we must have hooked into high 40's .  Un real,  Phil broke his rod as well,  He was fighting a huge chrome chinny and it snapped.  The fly rod was good today with Brown stone flies taking most of the fish...  Thanks again  dave"
