244892,Mike Pike,2008-08-30 14:53:00,1332,Stopped by a KW area trib of the Grand River yesterday afternoon to try my luck wading for Smallies.  Started pitching my Mepps spinners but the only takers were the Rock Bass( and plenty of 'em ).  So I switch up to tubes( white )and started working the same areas( just way slower )and that's when I started to connected.  These weren't the same crazy jumping Smallies of a few weeks ago.  They pretty much stayed down in the water and gave a good account of themselves in the current.  Also they were not as aggressive and striking short.  I wasn't able to bring any in 'til I set the hook way back into the tentacles of the tube.  Caught 4 smallies between 12 and 15 1/2 inches.  This was the day's biggun.   And away she went.   One of the bass spit up a bunch of pale crayfish which confirmed why the white tube was such a good choice.  Working 'em slowly around the rocks did the trick.  Hope everyone has a great Labour Day weekend!
