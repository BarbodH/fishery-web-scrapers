244693,Crazyhook,2008-08-29 22:59:00,1154,Bull like half the other emails that come through
244697,Dutch,2008-08-29 23:13:00,831,I got this too.  It has to be a scam - I guarantee that you will have to eventually provide your banking information/credit card number/ or pay pal info.  Just delete it.  There's no such thing as free money.....
244712,ccmtcanada,2008-08-30 00:00:00,7971,"Check this link....  http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/nothing/paypal.asp  There is a legitimate class action suit that involves paypal, but the case number in your email does not match the case number from snopes.com, so I'd suspect the one you received is a scam of some sort.  There is a link in that snopes article that you can click for more info..."
244739,maybe,2008-08-30 00:51:00,307,"The first whiff of a telemarketer, door-to-door salesman, spammer, scammer, or other Amway-type parasite approaching, and my claws come out.  That in mind, I started digging on this class action suit.  Here's what I found:  The url steelesettlement.com was registered for a 2 year term starting August 1/08.  It's owned by  Garden City Group 105 Maxess Road Melville, New York 11747 United States (631) 470-6823  Garden City Group is a subsidiary of Crawford & Company, which trades on the NY stock exchange as CRDA and CRDB.  Quick googling found GCG supporting autism, winning site awards, and adding executives.  If they don't exist, they're darned good at making ghosts.  105 Maxess Road is a corporate center.  The phone # is unlisted cable.  These guys have a bloody ton of class action suits on the go.  Take a look at their ""lawsuits beginning with S"" page.  This PayPal thing is on it...along with cases involving Saab, Sears, Sprint, Panasonic, HP and Staples.  Their NY office has had some people complain to the Better Business Bureau, but the OH office has been BBB approved since 2002."
244910,bassfighter,2008-08-30 16:44:00,366,"I agree with Tangled lines.  I went through their site as well, and notice all the lawsuit going on. The site looks legit or well planned by professional scammers. NO telephone is an indication of something fishy.  I typed on Google, and this new class action suit case was not found. All I found was the previous Class action suit before 2004.  I need to investigate more as it might be worth for me to get my $1000 back. I lost the money in 2006 without getting a software developed. Paypal did not protect me at all.   I am also searching for the reason how a scammers would benefit, if we are not to provide any info of our paypal account. Are they charging a fee?"
244974,Zib,2008-08-30 21:16:00,369,That is a scam. They had that story on the local news here in the Detroit area warning everyone about it.
245048,BillM,2008-08-31 02:26:00,17367,"Is there a link within the email to ""Confirm your Paypal Account""  ?"
