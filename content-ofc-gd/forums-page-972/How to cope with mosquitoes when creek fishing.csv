I noticed that unless the weather is either really really hot, cold down-pouring rain or windy ... they are everywhere and they hit me regardless of what repellent(s) I use, sun-protecton glove I wear  The worst part ... they know my face is where with the least repellent ...  Any advices?  ... here is one more reason to go WINTER steelheading ..."

244858,Greencoachdog,2008-08-30 12:39:00,8163, I use the full jacket... it works!
