Here are some pics.    A hot colour today black and green spey fly     Broke in the new G LOOMIS 9wt today, good stick for these fish   I will be out again on Friday and if anyone would like to fish on Sat let me know  Dave  P.S  Thats for the info SCOTT"

244504,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-29 13:48:00,0,"Nice! Man if my ankle wasn't swelling up again, I would definitely like to go fish some tribs. Haven't in years. Oh well, thanks for the report."
244527,DMASSE,2008-08-29 14:53:00,420,"Fishing pro  good to meet you as well.   We should go fishing sometime, you sound  hard core as much as I am.  All fish were females, and all had tons of eggs in them  ALL SKEIN.  Plus I usually dont get eggs from wild fish..   I like to buy hatchery eggs..  Personally I think this weekend is going to be great,  some of the waters I were at yesterday were prime and fish were starting to move around..  Looking forward in going again on Sat  Dave"
