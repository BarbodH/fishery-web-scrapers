244679,oldphart,2008-08-29 22:10:00,665,"   The K9 above is Brutus, a military K9 at McChord.  He's huge - part Boxer and part British Bull Mastiff and tops the scales at 200 lbs. His handler took the picture. Brutus is running toward me because he knows I have some Milk Bone treats, so he's slobbering away! I had to duck around a tree just before he got to me in case he couldn't stop, but he did. Brutus won the Congressional Medal of Honor last year from his tour in Iraq . His handler and four other soldiers were taken hostage by insurgents. Brutus and his handler communicate by sign language and he gave Brutus the signal that meant 'go away but come back and find me'. The Iraqis paid no attention to Brutus. He came back later and quietly tore the throat out of one guard at one door and another guard at another door. He then jumped against one of the doo rs repeatedly (the guys were being held in an old warehouse) until it opened. He went in and untied his handler and they all escaped. He's the first K9 to receive this honor. If he knows you're ok, he's a big old lug and wants to sit in your lap. Enjoys the comp any of cats.  K-9 Congressional Medal of Honor Winner  Thought you'd find this interesting.  Talk about animal intelligence and bonding with humans!     Remember that they can't do a lot of things for themselves and that they depend on you to make their life a quality life!  A PET'S TEN COMMANDMENTS.........  1. My life is likely to last 10-15 years. Any separation from you is likely to be painful.   2. Give me time to understand what you want of me.   3. Place your trust in me. It is crucial for my well-being.   4. Don't be angry with me for long and don't lock me up as punishment. You have your work, your friends, your entertainment, but I have only you.   5. Talk to me. Even if I don't understand your words, I do understand your voice when speaking to me.   6. Be aware that however you treat me, I will never forget it.   7. Before you hit me, before you strike me, remember that I could hurt you, and yet, I choose not to bite you.    8. Before you scold me for being lazy or uncooperative, ask yourself if something might be bothering me. Perhaps I'm not getting the right food, I have been in the sun too long, or my heart might be getting old or weak.    9. Please take care of me when I grow old. You too, will grow old.    10. On the ultimate difficult journey, go with me please. Never say you can't bear to watch. Don't make me face this alone. Everything is easier for me if you are there, because I love you so.    ~Take a moment today to thank God for your pets. Enjoy and take good care of them.  Life would be a much duller, less joyful experience without God's critters.    ~ We do not have to wait for Heaven, to be surrounded by hope, love, and joyfulness. It is here on earth and has four legs!"
