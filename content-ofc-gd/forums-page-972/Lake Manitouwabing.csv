244967,Smokey,2008-08-30 20:46:00,1278,"I fished the lake as a kid once a summer and it's how I got hook on the north. I can't remember names and places on the lake as they didn't seem to matter back then. I do remember catching lots of pike, bass and some walleye. I do also remember seeing some monsters coming out of the lake in the high 40's.  Hope you had a great time up there."
