240338,MCTFisher9120,2008-08-17 00:37:00,3761," Na man check the regulations. The best 5 bass man. Or for me at least. You did good to, i can't wait to see these fish. I got to use my american fishing snakes to catch some Canadian bass. My PB Largemouth bass for 2008(so far) and a PB Northern Pike and a PB Bowfin. When ever i had time i was out in our blow up boat fishing away. I broke the boat jinx on my recent trip to Bass Lake and i am finding my self catching more and more fish from a boat rather than shore. I only caught 1 fish from shore the entire time and that was the 2.11lb LMB above. Thanks for doing this with me L.A. and maybe we will do something like this next year. If we want to hold a poll feel free to post your pictures on this thread and just put the link to here on the poll thread. Have a good two weeks and i will be back with a Lake Seymoure Report.  Thanks Again  Mike!!!"
