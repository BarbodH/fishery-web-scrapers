Be careful out there and always remember if you are fishing alone, have that life jacket on...   As always the kids had a great time... and fishing beside us Sherri caught her personal best Walleye at just over 10lbs.  Way to go !     Little Jigger adds that he didn't even have to jig for these ones... lol...  Cheers Jen"

244986,Billy Bob,2008-08-30 22:31:00,5865,VERY nice fish. I have 3 hours tomorrow to catch a couple while drifting some worm harness. I hope to I can do half as good as you did.
