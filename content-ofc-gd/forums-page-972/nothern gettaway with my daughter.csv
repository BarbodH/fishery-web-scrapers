We were only there for two nights but well worth the drive up it was very nice to see my old friends again and get to visit some for the first time we even managed a few fis hfor the short time we did go fishing but that was not teh reason to get up there here are a couple pics from the weekend     my Daughter with a new friend the inch worm she let him go by the tree  :cheers:    not sure how this got up there I thought the wife was at home but maybe her boyfriend stole my boat and headed up with out us :???:      Oh yea we did get some fish also  my daughter with a perch then a pike       my daughter and I with a 19"" LM    Me and a 26"" pickerel   and a very awesome way to finish off a night out and a weekend away  "

Roy you are right that boat is one nice ride and makes for some comfy fishing with them bench seats and better seats up front then my Freightliner has you cant go wrong.  It would be nice to one day get up there for June but like I said we are booked for teh next??? how many years with MCI.
