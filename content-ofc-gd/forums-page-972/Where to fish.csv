243899,FLEX ROD,2008-08-27 17:36:00,394,"Hi Peps,  Simple you are in Aurora  - Simcoe Cooks Bay.  FLEX"
243900,bukee,2008-08-27 17:37:00,58,"From Aurora your a stones throw from Cook's Bay.  There you can get into perch, SM and LM Bass, and pike.  Good Luck and report back where ever you go."
243906,Peps,2008-08-27 18:02:00,191,"thanks guys,  i was thinking Cooks Bay, but i also had Scugog on my mind but I don't know where to launch in Scugog....any thoughts?  Peps"
243931,FLEX ROD,2008-08-27 19:26:00,394,"Peps, I still stand by my first post, go to COOKS BAY, you have it all and to boot it is in your back yard.  By any chance any space on board, I know Cooks Bay quite well if you are interested please let me know.  Thanks,  FLEX"
243932,ccmtcanada,2008-08-27 19:35:00,7971,Scugog is a tough lake to fish if you don't know where to go...especially this time of year when lots of it is just thick thick weeds.  That's why I don't fish it after July....unless someone out there wants to give up some secret spots....LOL.  Kidding...just kidding....(about the locations...not the weeds)
243948,Peps,2008-08-27 20:00:00,191,"I guess sucog is out....thanks Cliff. Flex if there is room i will let you know.  supposed to be 3 of us and that pretty much max out my boat, sorry dude maybe next time  peps"

244538,Peps,2008-08-29 15:16:00,191,"I gave up river fishing some time ago, after a not so pleasant encounter with a couple of treble hooking snaggers   .  It's to bad cause I really enjoyed it, and after that day I promised myself I would not go river fishing again.  So back to where I'm going might hit Sparrow Lake.  Peps"
