244926,Cudz,2008-08-30 18:21:00,2652,Got out this morning for some early smallmouth action.  6:30 until 10 am.  Got a bunch of fish but only a handful worth talking about.  Here are some pics.

244929,issamhay,2008-08-30 18:27:00,77,"If you dont mind me asking what is the general area you are fishing for them, around the 9th line of oro?"
244930,issamhay,2008-08-30 18:34:00,77,"Im getting desperate for some bass, haven't caught any this summer (all catch and release)."

244952,MCTFisher9120,2008-08-30 19:46:00,3761,Nice fish
244954,Greencoachdog,2008-08-30 19:54:00,8163,"Early morning is the time of day to get them now, before the boat traffic gets heavy!!!  Nice Smallies!!!"
244956,Cudz,2008-08-30 20:01:00,2652,lol.  yeah if you know the area at all it is a no brainer.  Were you out this morning?  There was someone else fishing around there as well.  Wasn't sure if it was anyone from this board though.
244970,misfish,2008-08-30 20:56:00,29133,"Was not I,but you can bet I,ll be out there come Monday AM,looking for some of the same action."
244973,issamhay,2008-08-30 21:15:00,77,"Something I've noticed is that Simcoe smallies don't really have much color and stripes, maybe its due to Simcoe's colder and clearer waters."
244985,Billy Bob,2008-08-30 22:30:00,5865," From the pics they look normal to me, but if not I believe it's because they are moving a lot (not holding in one area)."
