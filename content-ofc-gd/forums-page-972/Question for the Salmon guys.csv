How far offshore are guys charting fish now and other than rolling the dice, any preferred colour to use? Also with the price of gas / where the fish are, is there better places to start out from (ie-Pickering or Mississauga?). We are in North York and Bluffers is closest  Thanks - appreciate the help!"

How far offshore? that depends on where the fish are at and a lot of that depends on things such as water temperature and where baitfish are etc. Sometimes you can fish in tight in 50 or 60 feet of water (FOW), which maybe within a mile of shore, or you may have to go out into the blue zone in over 300 FOW and then you are looking at 4 miles or more.  The unique thing about Bluffers is that there is an underwater bluff that parallels the shoreline. This bluff tends to attract fish. The underwater bluff becomes more pronounced as you move closer to the islands. That is why the RC Harris water filtration plant is located at the foot of Vic Park. The underwater bluff off of the filtration plant drops off very rapidly, from 100 FOW to over 200 FOW within about 20 to 30 metres. Its this rapid drop off is where the raw water intake is.  Right off of Bluffers there is a rapid drop off at about 75 FOW and then another one at 100 FOW. Most people fish between 250 FOW and about 100 FOW. But again, you go where the fish are and you may find them in tight. Offshore trolling is much like hunting, because the lake is so big, you have to hunt for the fish and find that patch of water where they're at.  Hope this helps.  See you on the water."
