It was a wild ride, and lots of fun even though I was behind the camera... I did however get a chance to catch my first ever shark on this trip!  Enjoy!    Cheers, Ryan"

612502,The Urban Fisherman,2011-08-16 01:09:00,2050," Hey buddy,  They usually aren't so big and come in a lot easier! haha Captain Art doesn't just fish them for fun, he does all kinds of research and takes part in studies.... What was shown earlier in the show and in a previous episode is that the sharks are tagged, measured, they do samples and sometimes even put radio transmitters on them.... All that went down between landing the shark and releasing it.  Art is an awesome guy and shark fishing in Canada should def. Be on anybodies bucket list!    Cheers, Ryan"
