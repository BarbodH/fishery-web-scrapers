612204,Rich,2011-08-15 02:35:00,3927,"40 degree days with no wind, 2 different lakes and 3 rivers, brought in results we will not complain about. We did our best.  On the other half, we did somethin different from previous trips. Instead of camping in the cheapest possible spot, we rented a cabin for a couple nights. Well worth it. Ammenities, for very little more than a campsite with hydro.  The fish:                  The memories:                And don`t forget, ever, ever, the KAWARTHA DAIRY!    This has been a photo memory journey. Hope you enjoyed a bit of the good life like we did up there.  "
