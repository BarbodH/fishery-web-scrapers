613528,cram,2011-08-19 11:25:00,1733,...but that drunk lunatic could have run down some family of innocent bystanders in his paddleboat!!!  Wish the gov would focus law enforcement on people doing evil and/or endangering others.
613532,Rod Caster,2011-08-19 12:12:00,5784,Everybody here has done something stupider than this in their lifetime. Did you get arrested? Do you think that you deserve to be charged for your silly actions? Would you not defend your actions? This guy gets something similar to a DUI and will have a heck of a time getting a job now.... that's not right.  The cops should have led him home and if he turns into a drunken goon... then arrest him.  
613539,NAW,2011-08-19 12:34:00,4022,"Maybe I'm alone on this one..  But I see no issues with charging this guy.  Maybe not for the DUI, but for not have all the requires safety gear, or something.  The guy broke several laws.  Sure, he wasn't endangering others life, but he was endangering his own.  Just like wearing a seat belt, or a helmet on a motorcycle."
613542,cram,2011-08-19 12:47:00,1733," Then give him a ticket for no safety equipment.  A few hundred bucks, instead of a DUI on his record that impacts his drivers license and insurance.  If you're a drunk driver of a car or motorboat, you endanger the lives of others (as well as your own). I don't see this fitting in the same bucket."
613554,NAW,2011-08-19 13:04:00,4022, That's what I was getting at.
613576,craigdritchie,2011-08-19 13:44:00,1586,Definitely a slow news day.
613688,Tybo,2011-08-19 20:45:00,1373,I think they should spend billions of dollars to make individual laws for each and every one of us. Get a grip people!!!!
613689,Jer,2011-08-19 20:50:00,1426,"  Do we get to pick our own laws? If so, I'm in..."
613692,Tybo,2011-08-19 21:04:00,1373,Know what I truely; I think the tax payers should fork out a 100k to fined his dead ass corpse before I hit his dead ass with the Verado!!!
613703,misfish,2011-08-19 21:36:00,29133,"Is a Verado a motor or an engine? New law coming soon.   What happen to the days of ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Never mind. To many bleed hearts.   Im totaly against drinking and driving,but,,,,,,,,,,,,,   Like I said,,,,,,,,,,,  Never mind."
