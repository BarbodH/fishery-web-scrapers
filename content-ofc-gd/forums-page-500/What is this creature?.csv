613402,Terry,2011-08-18 22:52:00,14456," well I would agree, but I got caught up in the facts that it had an eye and mouth and died...with kept me going in a different direction "

613435,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-19 00:14:00,4399,  Yes indeed Science north is in on it! Donald Sutherland been there lately?
613445,mercman,2011-08-19 00:37:00,7054, And how do you explain the splash heard by the witness......Hummm? A deformed snake in a gelatinous mass would have mad a much different noise. More of a sploosh than a splash.
613492,HTHM,2011-08-19 02:17:00,4082,You're such a conspiracy theorist Paul... I am truely dissapointed. *sigh*
613493,GBW,2011-08-19 02:19:00,8460,I just coughed up one of those things too...
613497,adempsey,2011-08-19 02:24:00,1498,Looks like the thing ate a snake.   They are looking at the stomach contents!!  Very weird regardless.
613499,mercman,2011-08-19 02:27:00,7054,  Are you in on it to Albert? I never woulda guessed....

613630,Joey,2011-08-19 17:02:00,9122,Tell your friend to tell Science North she wants it back so she can get a second opinion.  It is hers after all!
613732,spincast,2011-08-19 23:09:00,3279,its the government white paper on doing away with the long form census. Where else would it go? A Walmart parking lot?

613209,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-18 11:26:00,4399,"I am telling you they are alien pods from the body snatchers, it`s all part of the master plan.  They have been sucking the life out of you by having you watch the Kardasians and swamp people now they are moving in with the pods with the final phase. If you seen Donald Sutherland walking around you know its true, kinda strange why they picked Sturgeon Falls first! well maybe not!!!"

613231,Rich,2011-08-18 13:10:00,3927,I know what that is. I've watched enough Spider-Man cartoons. It's the venom symbiote!
613234,Lip-ripper,2011-08-18 13:18:00,228,A turd that fell from a plane that flew by? That would explain the splash!  In all seriousness though it looks like a Bryozoan.
613250,hammercarp,2011-08-18 14:39:00,964,Looks to me like a chunk of lily pad root with and egg mass or one of those bryozoans on it. The jelly could also be just a result from the root breaking down. But I like the pod theory the best.
613258,Rod Caster,2011-08-18 15:03:00,5784,  http://www.magma.ca/~syatabe/water_brains/water_brains.html  Maybe a Bryozoan...doesn't explain the catfish eyes and mouth though

Really....  a Biologist at Science North called to tell her that it was a snake`.. actually multiple snakes... they counted 12 of them with 1 1/2 heads something to do with the egg sacks ... kinda like siamese twins, it was destined for death and was about 2 months old....a freak of nature.  She'll get more news tomorrow....   Randy "

613391,Rod Caster,2011-08-18 22:31:00,5784,That is NOT what I had expected. The photos show no signs of a snake at all... a two month old garten snake would be tiny... I can't see how it would swell up that large. I'm not a biologist so I can't argue... but I still say it's a new species hahaha.

They showed it off to cottagers and none of them knows what it is.... honestly neither do I  .  She described it to be about as big as a 600ml Pepsi Bottle or a Tall Boy Beer Can...maybe a little bigger,  She said it has no legs but tentacles like a squid..eyes and mouth like a Catfish  and about as hard as a Tadpole... apparently had what looked to be a translucent skin and weird colors....along with a lot of slime...she swears up and down that it's not a joke.. and she's a rather serious person.  She should get information back from Science North sometime next week..  Have a look see ... whaddaya think it is?      Randy "
