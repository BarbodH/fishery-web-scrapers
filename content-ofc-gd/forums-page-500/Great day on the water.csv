613050,GBW,2011-08-17 21:47:00,8460,now till Nov is my fav. time of year!  the kids go to bed when it's getting dark and that means I get more time on the water and off the dock!     I'm soooo looking forward to this weekend.
613063,limeyangler,2011-08-17 22:24:00,5204,love winter...bring on the ice...but we still have fall walleye fishing before....win win situation.  Nice picture though.
