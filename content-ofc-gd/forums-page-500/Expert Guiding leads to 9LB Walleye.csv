613096,mike rousseau,2011-08-17 23:20:00,4661,  pauls pb...  its my biggest in the boat this year...
613097,mercman,2011-08-17 23:22:00,7054,  So that means you owe me big time Mike Good for advertising.Nudge nudge...wink wink
613254,limeyangler,2011-08-18 14:51:00,5204, lol...i knew that...sorry Paul.
613494,mercman,2011-08-19 02:19:00,7054," Thats OK Simon, It was great seeing his face as he helped get it into the boat.First thing he did was text his brother who was fishing further up the lake.Even his brother was excited, which made me feel great too. Mikes a great guide and good friend. We are going out again in October and i'm gonna get a 30incher. I can feel it in my bones"
611988,mercman,2011-08-14 02:43:00,7054,"Met up with Mike(Musky Mike) at his place in Cornwall around 10am.Met his little guy,what a great Kid gonna be a great fisherman like his Dad too. Grabbed a quick bite and headed dow the the Franny for some Walters.Got on the water around 11.30am, and within 20mins i had my first one on.Nice 2lber. The day was starting out right Then the bite stopped.We hit a couple of his spots, and nothing.I could see the concern on Mikes face.He was starting to think that something was wrong. I get fish outa here all the time, must be a weather front or something, he said.Third spot yielded a few more nice eaters. Now we had 4 fish on bord.   This kept up, and Mke had finally dialed them in.All were caught trolling crankbaits, the type and style of which i swore never to reveal. Stopped for lunch, and then back out.All in all, we caught 15 really nice fish, i took home my limit, and i through this one back.29in 9lb.Bigest walleye i have ever seen.The biggest Mike has had in hes boat this year  Mike really came through for us today.He proved his skill, and for the rest of the day, he consistantly put us on fish after fish.In 6 1/2 hours on the water, we caught 15 fish.Not little weiners like i am used to catching, but big, fat, beautifully colored and healthy Walleye. If anyone wants to get into some of these beautyes, PM him, and set up a day. I am thrilled with my time on the water with him today.So far we have fished together twice, first time he put me onto my first Musky, now, the best walleye fishing i have ever had. Thanks Mike!!!You know your water, and your fish. Here are a few more pics. The huge Perch was given to me by a guy coming off the water.Showed him my cooler, and his mouth fell open  "
611990,Handlebarz,2011-08-14 03:04:00,3790,Great report Paul congrats to you and Mike for another great day on the water

612007,adolson,2011-08-14 04:29:00,783,Very nice fish! Sounds like Mike will be very successful as a guide. Kinda makes me want to take a trip..
612018,Whitespinnerbait,2011-08-14 10:43:00,2038,  If his wife was with him it would be............. 12!!   That's what i'm assuming  BTW  Looks like ya hit a Gold Mine. Congrats
612019,Terry,2011-08-14 10:50:00,14456,I would say his wife someone took the photos   nice going
612025,mike rousseau,2011-08-14 12:05:00,4661, Well I wanted one for supper...  I clean all the fish for guests at my house... So I kept 1 for supper and sent Paul and Barb home with 8 and a perch...  We could have had 12 in those newspapers...
612030,Billy Bob,2011-08-14 12:30:00,5865,VERY NICE outing....and some GREAT eating to look forward to...  It looks like Musky Mike set the bar VERY high today...
612031,mike rousseau,2011-08-14 12:33:00,4661,Hey Paul... I believe that gives you the biggest walleye in the OFC tournament...
612033,mercman,2011-08-14 12:38:00,7054,"  Of Course the wife comes with me.She is the best fishing partner i have.Because she likes to fish, i get to fish whenever i want.We were 3 licenced fishers in the boat."
612034,mercman,2011-08-14 12:41:00,7054," Looks like it Mike.The season is still young Maybe next time we're out, i'l get a 30 incher ."
612038,SlowPoke,2011-08-14 12:51:00,2984,Nice job guys! Cornwall eh? I need to start packing a rod or two when I go through there everyday!! lol

612096,misfish,2011-08-14 19:51:00,29133,Well done Paul. Nice feed of fish there.    Lightly batter and dip in Cattleboyz.    I found a local with that sauce.Good to go for a while.Thanks for the introduction.
612108,mike rousseau,2011-08-14 20:22:00,4661,Can't wait to try walleye cooked with cattle boyz... Maybe tomorrow...
612112,Nipfisher,2011-08-14 20:41:00,2449,My appolgies to everyone involved in the trip. I am used to guides NOT fishing. So I was thinking a 2 person limt. I have P.M.'d Paul with an apology. I am not like that. It was past midnight and I was exhausted (horseshoe tournament and lots of beverages). I should have never questioned it on a public forum.  Sorry to Musky Mike as well. It was a beauty fish Paul and matches my PB which I caught when I was a teenager.  Lesson learned it will never happen again.  Again very sorry.   Blair
612117,mike rousseau,2011-08-14 20:51:00,4661,"I always fish... But I don't really catch much...lol... The guests are in the front half of the boat and run on a ""normal"" length of line... And I run a LONG like behind their lures... It's mostly for feel so I know where our baits are... But the long line does get the odd fish...  No hard feelings on my end nipfisher... I've questioned people in public threads about stuff that maybe I shouldnt have...  And I've also had some beverages is the sun all day... You get PRETTY relaxed after a dozen wobbly pops playing horseshoes... Lol"
612119,mercman,2011-08-14 20:56:00,7054," Hey Blair. I kinda figured you were tired, cause its not like you at all. Lets put it behind us and get fishin. I still like and respect you as a bud  Paul"

612129,fishnsled,2011-08-14 21:25:00,3520,Great day on the water!! Congrats on the hog Paul!
612130,Terry,2011-08-14 21:26:00,14456,group hugs all around  glad we are all friends  sometimes a picture only says 100 words instead of a thousand words that it is suppose to say and the meaning gets lost  glad we got it figured out
