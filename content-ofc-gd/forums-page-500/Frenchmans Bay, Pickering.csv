My buddy told me his neighbour went out and caught a bunch of smallies the other day. I was thinking it was mostly Largies and Pike.  Anyone had any luck lately???  Thanks in advance  Jason"
613033,sunfish,2011-08-17 20:36:00,57,My son likes to go there to kill some time and fish.  This year he says he's caught tonnes of Rock Bass and Gobey!  I think he has mentioned the odd largie and last year he almost pulled in his first Pike.
613075,GoneFishin,2011-08-17 22:45:00,349,Never caught a smallie in the bay but have caught largies. They don't tend to hang around in the bay very long so you would probably be better off going to the nuke plant and trying for smallies.
613155,Anthonyd,2011-08-18 01:41:00,6,now youll get largemouth pike catfish in the bays itself ice time youll get pike jumbo perch slab crappies the odd sheepshead and trout if you got a boat go to outflows of the nukeplant fish for smallies there or go right out of the mouth near the large red and green buoys fish either side of it it gets 10ft and drops there theres rockpoints on eachside where you should get into some fish be carefull you dont get to close
613170,addymark,2011-08-18 02:11:00,69,saw an episode of fishin' canada where they fished at the nuke plant... the water looked a lot cleaner out there than what I have seen in the bay.  is the bay fairly shallow... never fished it.

Was told this by security detail when I remarked about the waters probably making for good fishing, kinda like the old Hearn Generating station in Toronto and it's outflows."
