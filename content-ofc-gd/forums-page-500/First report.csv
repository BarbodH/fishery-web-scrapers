612928,mattp33,2011-08-17 14:30:00,290,"Well finally got out to do some serious fishing from friday until tuesday.  We headed up to sparrow lake to a friends cottage.  We left at 11 on friday and made a few stops on the way up.  Traffic was horrible going through barrie.  They were calling for t-storms sunday but they seemed to pass us by to the south.  we had pretty good weather. I wasn't sure about how the fishing was going to be, I hate fishing post cold front conditions.  We were hunting for some bass for fun and walleye for food.  The bass were tough to come by but the walleye were always biting.  Not a night went by without having some walleye action and dinner.  I finnaly hooked up to a nice bass on tuesday.  I think they started to come off the structure they have been clinging to all weekend.  My girl friend even got into the walleye fishing and schooled me a couple of night.  This bass a got in about 4 FOW, he was sitting in the middle of a small isolated pocket of lilly pads.  I pitched a senko into the middle and got a little tug, when i set tho there was nothing there.  I threw right back in and let it settle, gave it a twitch then WHAM!  it was on!  He wrapped himself up in a few lilly pad stalks, as i was fighting with him I had this really strange SNAP!  Then I noticed that the tip of my st croix legend tournement had broke?  what the hell?  I finally got him in.  He had a fin sticking out of his gullet so I gave it a slight pull.  Long and behold he had a 6 inch sunfish digesting in his stomach.  The thing was so big that the body was in his stomach and the tail fin was sticking out into his mouth.  What was he thinking?      Thanks for reading my first report!  Hope it was ok  Sparrow is on fire this year!  Oh ya almost forgot.  I had heard about dog fish but never caught 1 until this weekend.  We were trolling worm harnesses for walleye and I hooked into at least a 20lbs dog fish.  What an ugly fish, but what a fight!  I thought I had the mother of all walleye.  He had a minnow rig still in his mouth.  I did him a favor and pulled that out as well."
612938,asdve23rveavwa,2011-08-17 14:50:00,2690,Thanks for posting.  Shame about the St. Croix.
612942,mattp33,2011-08-17 14:59:00,290,yeah its a heart breaker.  I am going to warranty it as it has a life time but the down time on the rod will be a few weeks at best.  I have a fleet of them and this have never happened to any of them.  I just picked this 1 up last week and its my first time with line on it.  MUST be a defect! (I hope)  I shed a few tears for the rod back at the cottage.
612947,SmokestackLightnin,2011-08-17 15:11:00,390," That must have been quite a fish, the Ontario record is 15.1 pounds, caught in none other than......wait for it...... Dog Lake."
612948,ccmtcanada,2011-08-17 15:14:00,7971,Great first report!  Interesting about the bass biting off more than it could chew!!!  Sounds like you have the walleye dialed in nicely there.  Thanks for posting!
612950,mercman,2011-08-17 15:17:00,7054,Nice fishin !!! At least the wife will hold a fish with gloves.Mine wont go anywhere near them Just likes catching them.  
612955,johnnyb,2011-08-17 15:25:00,3413,"Nicely done!  Lots of boat traffic on Sparrow, but it's an impressive fishery"
612970,mattp33,2011-08-17 16:11:00,290,Ok maybe it wasn't a 20lbs dog fish but it was HUGE! I didn't want to touch it to get a weight let alone a pic.  They have an impressive set of teeth!
613010,beginner,2011-08-17 18:59:00,542,nice fish  
613024,Rod Caster,2011-08-17 19:49:00,5784,What's a dog fish? Is it also known as a mud puppy?
613025,mercman,2011-08-17 19:57:00,7054," No RC, Ever see those fish that follow around catfish all day? Those are dog fish.....Sheesh....Gotta tell ya everything"
613026,Rod Caster,2011-08-17 20:00:00,5784," Haha Ohhh, meow I get it."
613068,limeyangler,2011-08-17 22:31:00,5204,":thumbsup_anim:  :thumbsup_anim:   You write a mean report!  Great moment by moment description of that bass,was with ya all the way it seemed."
613071,mattp33,2011-08-17 22:34:00,290,"I was told that a dog fish is also known as a Bowfin, often mistaken for snakehead.  I can tell you they put up a wicked fight!  I took my rod into a local shop today and they said its no problem to get a new 1 for me.  Just takes 2-3 weeks.  The boat traffic is crazy, always something coming out of the servern of going in.  The mouth is the best place and where we got most of out walters."
