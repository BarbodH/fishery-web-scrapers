I suppose there would be some resident browns, but they seem kind of hard to catch for a newbie like me...  Would I have better luck by the pier?  Thanks"

Further downstream near the lake, you'll mostly find warm water fish. There may be a few salmon kicking around at the pier after dark. Try throwing some glow in the dark spoons off the pier.
