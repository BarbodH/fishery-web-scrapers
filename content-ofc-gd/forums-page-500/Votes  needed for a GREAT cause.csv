611967,Handlebarz,2011-08-14 01:11:00,3790,Come on OFC we can get a lot more votes for Ted on this heck its only gone up by 40 votes since yesterday I hope by Monday when everyone is back from the weekend we can push him into the lead this is a great cause

612023,vance,2011-08-14 12:01:00,719,done this is a worth while cause     vance
612087,Handlebarz,2011-08-14 18:57:00,3790,I would say the OFC factor is working as he has gained a lot over the last day or so since we have started to help out keep him going as he is still way over 100 votes behind
612190,Handlebarz,2011-08-15 01:28:00,3790,WOW less then 50 votes to go and he is in first place I think the OFC family is showing the strength we have thanks for the help I hope tomorrow we smash past 1st place on the 12th when I first voted he had 233 votes now he has 453 very cool the burned kids will love this for sure.
612230,Handlebarz,2011-08-15 10:02:00,3790,Dang 553 that's 100 votes in less then 9 hours and all over night keep it going lets put Ted so far out front he can not be caught.
612289,Chance,2011-08-15 15:08:00,420,Another vote on its way Mike.This is an amazing camp and really needs all the support it can get !!!

612297,Chance,2011-08-15 15:18:00,420,"For some reason I click on the ""vote for this vid"" and cannot place a vote.Anybody else having this issue?"
612543,Handlebarz,2011-08-16 10:06:00,3790,Dang over 780 now that is amazing I know not a lot of people are replying here but it seems as they are voting thanks for helping this great cause out.  Chance I had the same problem at first but then tried again and it worked. I did also comment on his video yesterday and see it is gone now???
612884,Handlebarz,2011-08-17 09:34:00,3790,Well he is at 970 today I hope a lot of the support if from OFC I know not many are posting here but I hope your the ones voting for him. Keep up the votes if you are.
612896,ccmtcanada,2011-08-17 12:00:00,7971,"Wow...with second place at 544 votes, lets hope he gets it!!!"
613371,Handlebarz,2011-08-18 21:34:00,3790,he can still use some votes for this cause. I have posted twice on the site and both times it has been removed kinda weird. Any way hope we can get some more votes.
