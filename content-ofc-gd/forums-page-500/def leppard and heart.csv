613640,Stern Rules,2011-08-19 17:25:00,342,"I was gonna go but didn't like the price of the tickets, even the worst seats were too much. Would've paid that for the Hysteria tour but not this one. Had tickets when they were supposed to hit Hamilton with Styx and REO but that got postponed and replaced with Billy Idol. Passed on that one. Was pissed about that."
