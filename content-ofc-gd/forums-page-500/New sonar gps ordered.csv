Ordered the humminbird 597ci hd di Wich has down imaging... On sale for $599 and a free screen cover... From cabbalas...  A big review is soon to come next week...  im exited about that color display over my black and white...  and im really pumped to play with the down imagiing... as well as switchfire...  im not exited about plugging in my 150 waypoints from my lowrance... is there an easy way to do this? maybe save to a blank sd card or something? my lowrance is pretty old so i dont know what kinda options i have with it...
