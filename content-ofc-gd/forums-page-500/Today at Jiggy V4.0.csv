610205,Rod Caster,2011-08-08 13:27:00,5784,Nice size bass man!  Is Jiggy part of the OFC Community?
610220,TJQ,2011-08-08 14:27:00,7806,"Thanks all!!! Im hoping to get up here as much as possible in august.	The Lures are the Mangler frog lures, you can use em as a topwater and then they dive down about a foot for the retrieve, the side to side action is really good. I casted and trolled all day with them.    I have ni idea why the duck is mooning me, and wayne, stay tuned , youll have lots of time to visit!!  Joey, i think its her nails that attract the fish!!!"

613585,adolson,2011-08-19 14:13:00,783,"I ordered some lures from that site on Aug 8th, and they arrived today. Looking forward to trying them out! Great prices, really. Thanks T.J.!  Edit: I tried them out tonight. FIRST CAST I got a smallmouth with the darker green frog! Lost it at the dock as I bent down to grab it the hook popped out, so I didn't get a pic. Great lure!"
