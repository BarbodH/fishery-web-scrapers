613128,limeyangler,2011-08-18 00:11:00,5204, Those jigging raps are an awesome product....starting to use them more in summer when conditions are right...and they have always been KILLER through the ice.    Thanks man!
613184,Nipfisher,2011-08-18 03:09:00,2449,Put it up on the Team 2 board. That is an inch bigger.
613197,Jewelbee,2011-08-18 08:33:00,422,Nice fish! Love your video.
613221,asdve23rveavwa,2011-08-18 12:34:00,2690," I might have to take one or two up to Windermere...can experiment on the eyes, or lakers."
613242,Old Man,2011-08-18 13:48:00,822,Nice one Simon. I'll have to pay a visit to that lake this year.
612805,limeyangler,2011-08-17 01:29:00,5204,"Hi All,  went to our local provincial Park the other day. This is a deep lake that holds Lakers too, i usually catch at least 4 or 5 lakers when jigging in the boat in summer, but the trout have been few and far between this year.  However, i have been catching walleye like never before....and like most walleye from deep trout lakes....they are big! I had caught some really nice walleye in a spot there 2 weeks before and decided to give it another shot....see if it was just chance or i'd stumbled onto something.  After 2 hours of seeing walleye on the bottom not responding to anything i put in front of them i wandered off in search a trout.... LOL....and caught a walleye in 56' FOW!  I headed back to the original spot and not long after the bite turned on. I think i got around 6 or 7 walleye none under 22"" with a real pig and this year's PB for me at 28"".   <iframe width=""560"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/pb1wnA-jNac"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>                        "

612877,Hooked,2011-08-17 05:12:00,891,Nicely done!  What is the name of that jig?  Looks like some kind of jigging rap?
612883,spincast,2011-08-17 09:31:00,3279,  Maybe a bunch of us can buy a place (or more) together and turn it into an OFC timeshare / resort for GTGs?. Then every time Simon goes out to fish he'll have a convoy of boats behind him As always Simon - nice Fish - need that jeaous Icon with druel down its chin. Frankie65 is taking this real hard - gold is his fave
612890,trapshooter,2011-08-17 10:50:00,1234,Nice fish Simon!  A 28 is a great walleye.

612999,ehg,2011-08-17 18:07:00,2666,That is a super nice chunky big walleye musta been around 8+lbs. You live in a great area for fishing.  That jig is called a Jigging Shad Rap. Thus the chunkier profile. Here is a link to them. http://www.rapala.com/products/lures/jigging_rap/
613124,limeyangler,2011-08-18 00:03:00,5204," thanks Roy    Thanks Bruce.    Thanks Randy.   Yup...i was on Red Bull.    I was using it to straight jig lakers, i also use them in the fall on lac seul on calm days when fishing for walleye...very effective sometimes....white 4"" tube jigs work good too.....i decided to try them all last year...why not when straight jigging...no different than fishing through the ice.....right?    Thanks Cliff.   ["
