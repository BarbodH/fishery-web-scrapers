612926,NAW,2011-08-17 14:21:00,4022,"I might have an opportunity to purchase this motor:  2004 Yamaha 20hp Long shaft 2-Stroke  The motor is as his cottage, so he can't take the measurements that I need to know.  Just wondering if anyone has this motor, and could let me know a few things.  1.  The distance from the top of the transom to the center of the prop?  2.  How are these motors on gas?  3.  Running a light 14' aluminum, what kind of top end speed would I expect?  Looking on the Yamaha website, the shaft of the SS is 15"", and the shaft on the LS is 20"".  But I don't know how the shaft length corresponds to the transom dimension I asked about above.   Here's a link to the motor - http://www.yamaha-motor.ca/products/products.php?model=3791&section=td&group=O#contentTop  I know it's a bit of a long shot, but any help on this would be great.  If the dimensions work out, I may drive up the Perrysound and pick it  up.  Might be able to grab it for $1000 bucks..."

612932,NAW,2011-08-17 14:36:00,4022, It's going on my duck/fishing boat.  No link.
612935,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-17 14:41:00,10439,Shaft measurement is from the transom bracket where it rests on the transom to the cavitation plate on the lower unit. You want the cavitation plate an inch or two below the bottom of the transom.
612969,Fisherman,2011-08-17 16:11:00,7201,"If it's a long shaft, it will be approximately 19-21 inches.  If your transom is around 14-15 inches, you need a short shaft."
612983,NAW,2011-08-17 17:18:00,4022,"Thanks for the info Gents.  Just measured my transon.  15"".  I guess I keep searching.  If any one knows of a someone selling a 20 or 25hp motor, fire me a PM."
