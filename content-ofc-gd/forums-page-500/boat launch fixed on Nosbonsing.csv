613187,Nipfisher,2011-08-18 03:29:00,2449,Those are my Red Head sandals. Not lonley and the bast sandals I've ever owned. I had them off to help them out. That launch is closed until Friday but the one on Big Moose Rd. is all fixed and is terrific. Nice to have deep water at the launch you can drive on and off your trailer.
