We launched from Centennial Beach on Kempenfelt Bay because of the easy beach area for the little guy.    After it was established that he wasn't going to try to jump out, or throw a fit, I set about trying to coax a panfish or to from the depths.    There was some concern he would drop my ultrlite combo into the abyss.    And despite expert advise on not reeling the fish right up to the tip-top he was no match for the expert.    No worries about holding on the the fish.      Although he was more interested in playing with my spare paddle in the water.       Great day.  "
613318,Nemo,2011-08-18 18:26:00,727,Nice shots. Good outing for the young one. Who was taking the photos?
613321,johnnyb,2011-08-18 18:29:00,3413,Well...the canoe doesn't look THAT short....but it definitely looked like a great day on the water
613330,Joey,2011-08-18 18:42:00,9122,"Great photos, looks like a nice day out there.  I'm guessing it is a GoPro camera on the canoe?"
613334,NAW,2011-08-18 18:52:00,4022,"Great day on the water eh!  A good way to get the boy into fishing.   If you would have gone out yesterday, you would have seen a military search and rescue helicopter flying around the bay."
