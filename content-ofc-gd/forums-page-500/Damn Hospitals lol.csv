612449,spinnerbaitking,2011-08-15 22:15:00,1622,"OK my Temperature has been down 48hrs last night & I was thinking I should be out of here today, yesterday when the Doctor made his rounds my IV Antibiotics scipt ran out so the Doctor says I'll add some & we'll see what happens tomorrow, when your Doctor comes in, well my Doctor comes in & says I see they put you on Antibiotics for another 48 hrs yesterday that's not a bad Idea so we'll keep you until tomorrow & you'll likely get out of here Tuesday lol, I said what ever I'd like to make sure I 'm Health enough to get my next Chemo Treatment on Aug 19th so do what ever you think you need too, I guess no Fishing for me This week Maybe Next week like you guys are saying they'll be waiting for me when ever I get to go lol, this giving me lots of time to work on my new idea & its growing every day I get to spend time on it, Wednesday should be a good day. Thanx & Tight Lines Richard Elliott Jr"
612451,irishfield,2011-08-15 22:17:00,26272,Generally a 5 day stay if you admit with fever and no white's Richard. If this happens again ask them about Home Care and a portable pump for the antibiotics... it's all free and a well run service.
612452,spinnerbaitking,2011-08-15 22:23:00,1622,"I'm going to have a talk to my Doctor's lol, I'm finding out more from you then them lol, I imagine I'll find out lots on Aug 19th my next Chemo Treatment I actually have Questions know lol Thanx & Tight Lines Richard"
612457,irishfield,2011-08-15 22:42:00,26272,"We, unfortunately, didn't get Jen the home care option until her 4th admittance for fever, that only came to light out of frustration. So if everything else is okay and you're just lying there getting an antibotic IV.. it's a lot nicer for you, and cheaper for them to do home care with a portable battery operated pump!"
613759,spinnerbaitking,2011-08-20 00:39:00,1622,"Hey Guys Just got home from my 2nd Chemo, everything went well, Blood work at 08:30, met Doctor & Nurse at 10:00, Treatment at 12:30 & finished by 4:30, not too bad at all, Thanx for the words of encouragement & my battle is 1/3 over, doctor said she had all the Scans & Reports back & looking at them I have a 70% chance of a CURE, what more can you ask for. Oh ya I found out I'm Stage 3 today not that it's a big deal Still going to be getting the same Treatment Thanx & Tight Lines Richard"
613763,ccmtcanada,2011-08-20 00:52:00,7971,That's great news Richard!   Hang in there with the great attitude...I believe that has a lot to do with beating this disease.
611605,spinnerbaitking,2011-08-12 14:20:00,1622,"Hey I was told if my Temperature went above 38.2 that i'm supposed to go to the Hospital right then any time of the day or night, well yesterday at noon it was 39.3, off to the hospital I go, they did white cell counts & said they don't like to see them below 1 & my are .5 figures lol, so I'm admitted until my Temperature comes down & stays down for 48 hrs, looks like I'm here for the weekend, I'll let everybody know what's happening as I find out Thanx & Tight Lines Richard Hope everybodies been busy catchin the big ones, I'll try & get caught up on what I've been missing the last 1/2 week"
611607,irishfield,2011-08-12 14:27:00,26272,"Sorry to hear that Richard... but don't say I didn't tell you so !  You have no immunity.. don't let anyone near you with a sniffle. Be vigilant that staff are gloving and gowning!  At home... hand sanitizer at each access to your home. DO NOT let anyone past that dispenser without using it... no matter how many times they say ""I'm just here for a quick hello"". If they're not healthy they don't come in the door...period... that includes family so be sure they have alternative places to stay if they become the slightest bit ill.  If people have dry hand issues there is a moisturizing sanitizer mfg by Gold Bond. We had to bring it up from the USA.. but recently saw it in the Rexall Drug Store in Mount Sinai."
611608,bushart,2011-08-12 14:41:00,2628,Take Care
611609,Pikeslayer,2011-08-12 14:42:00,1443,"Richard, As Wayne has stated, you gots to be extremely dilligent. And here's my two cents worth of experience; 'Positive Recovery Attitude/Behaviour' will be a game breaker in you winning this thing. BUT, there is a fine line between PRAB (hmmmm, I like that acronym) and overdoing it. Conversely, you don't want to go to the opposite end either; negative recovery attitude/behaviour (which BTW it sems you are not capable of). If you think about, you've probably gone and done something you shouldn't have??  Pushed the envelope a little too far perhaps???  Get that cell count righted and stay well !!  Regards, Simon"
611612,Spiel,2011-08-12 14:56:00,9065,"I've had more than a few hospital stays over the last few years Richard, while no one wants to be there I'll admit they treated me like royalty! I hope you are receiving the same treatment. Worry not, you'll be out soon and as right as rain."
611614,spinnerbaitking,2011-08-12 14:57:00,1622,"Hey Irish I was thinking the same way, they told me i would need to wear a mask when someone came in to see me, I just laughed & said so they can come in here & spread their germs in my room & leave then when I take my mask off I'm Breathing in what ever they left, I said as of now if I leave my room I'll wear a mask, but know one comes in to my room with out a mask Period & they went & got a box of masks & put them at the door, so I didn't listen to your advise about that idea I want to do, but I sure did about the Medical stuff, know if I could just remember everything, I just asked the nurse if they have a sign that could go at my door saying hand sanitizer needs to be appied before entering & a mask needs to be put on or stay out & she's gone to get them. Thanx & Tight Lines Richard"
611615,Joey,2011-08-12 15:00:00,9122,"Hope your temp comes down soon.  I remember when they told me the same thing, and then when my temp went up over what it was supposed to be, I did not want to go back to the hospital.  But in the end I did and they were right and it is for your own good.  As Wayne said, be diligent in staying germ free and you'll be out of there in no time.  Take care and be well.  Joey"
611617,irishfield,2011-08-12 15:02:00,26272,"They rarely do it anymore.. but it's called ""reverse isolation"". You lie in bed.. they do the gown/glove/mask work! Demand it... it's your life not theirs!"
611634,spinnerbaitking,2011-08-12 15:35:00,1622,"I believe sometime you need to go over & beyond so when I got home I went down to work Gay Lea Foods our Dairy plant & ordered 4 Chesse basket Trays one for each of the wards I stayed at in Wingham & KW Grand River Hospitals & they will be delivered by me, I thought the next time the main nurse i had at Wingham was working to be shared with all the staff & 3 for KW Grand River Hospital wards I was on, will be taken down on my next treatment day which is Aug 19th, to say THANK YOU for the 1st class treatment i received while in hospital, the Store Manager just Deliverying the basket so they can have it for their Lunch & Break, that nurse is working too, lol, should have seen the look on the faces of all the staff, it was priceless, the basket has to be $75 to $100 worth of Cheese, Meat, Crackers & Dipps & Gay Lea Foods is Donating it for Me SWEET Thanx & tight Lines Spinnerbaitking"
