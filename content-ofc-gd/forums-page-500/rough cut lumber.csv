611732,Freshtrax,2011-08-12 23:55:00,2215,Hey guys i need help. I have bin trying to find some rough cut white oak lumber. But sawmills dont generaly have websites or advertise in the yellowpages unfortunatly. Im workin on a cedar strip runnabout and need to replace a bunch of ribs.. Boatshops charge an arm and a leg i would rather give my money to some hillbilly in the woods with a family owned sawmill... Anyone have any ideas?  Also anyone know where to find solid brass nails and screws?
611733,irishfield,2011-08-12 23:57:00,26272,"Probably help to know where you are... I know of some real nice ""Hillbillies"" in Powassan that may help with what you need..."
611734,Freshtrax,2011-08-13 00:00:00,2215,Anywhere south of huntsville and west of ottawa will do.  I travel allot for work
611735,Freshtrax,2011-08-13 00:01:00,2215,I was just kidding with the hillbilly thing.. I consider myself one
611736,irishfield,2011-08-13 00:03:00,26272,I was thinking the Giesler's may be able to help you out in Powassan. Not sure if they sell out parts from the boat shop or stick to building their own.
611738,ChrisK,2011-08-13 00:12:00,2772,Kevin at Lakair Lodge has a hole pile of it on his property if I'm not mistaken. He cut down a bunch of trees a few years ago and sent them to a sawmill and now it sits rough cut piled up on the back of his property. http://www.lakair.com/
611739,Freshtrax,2011-08-13 00:15:00,2215,Ill track em down maby they can point me in the right direction anyways... Theres a mill outside of huntsville i bought cherry from when i was a kid and made canow paddles out of it i cant for the life of me remember where it was though.

611784,nroadrunner,2011-08-13 02:55:00,113,hey freshtrax  there is a mill just east of huntsville on a sideroad from HWY#60  Nadrofski's mill  on Tally ho winter park road.    Ian
611797,Freshtrax,2011-08-13 07:42:00,2215,Thats the one. Thanks man. I sent millers an email.. This forum is awsome. You can find the answers to almost anything
611915,Musky or Specks,2011-08-13 21:17:00,2710,Its not the term rough cut your looking for its air dried. Try A&M Wood Specialties  http://www.forloversofwood.com/default.aspx
613029,Freshtrax,2011-08-17 20:18:00,2215,Well i spent 5 hours last sunday looking in my uncles woodlot for a sutable white oak to send to the mill. Checked every tree in 40 acres.. Only found two. One was too small. And one i would have felt realy guilty cutting down for 250 board ft of lumber.  It was 80 ft tall and HUGE.  So we called his neibour and he conviently had a green log he would cut up for 2bucks a board foot. It worked out quie well
613031,Dara,2011-08-17 20:28:00,3052,I think a more common wood for canoe gunwales would be white ash
613067,Freshtrax,2011-08-17 22:29:00,2215,Working on a ceader strip fishing boat keel ribs and transom are white oak
613072,dhickey,2011-08-17 22:35:00,1038,2nd the ash. Cant beet it on boats.

613090,Freshtrax,2011-08-17 23:06:00,2215,Sorry for the doubble post..ill take some pics this weekend im startin the restoration..its probably not worth restoring. But it was my uncles boat who died a few years back. I learned to fish in this boat and its bin in the family for sixty years
613205,Musky or Specks,2011-08-18 10:58:00,2710,If its still in log form it going to need about a year and a half to season once its cut and thats probably still pushing it. Problem is no one really builds boats using white oak anymore. So there is no market for air dried material. It mostly gets cut up into Kiln Dried Qrtd White Oak and is used in furniture and millwork applications.
613220,Dara,2011-08-18 12:32:00,3052,I can get air dried black ash up here and I have a pile of air dried red oak that I cut and dried myself for furniture. We have a yard that sells ash strips 16 and 18 feet long for gunwales but they are pretty proud of them.
613341,Freshtrax,2011-08-18 19:29:00,2215,The ribs are all bieng steamed. Steaming works best with green oak anyways.  The transom and keel boards 2 1/4 inch stuff were gonna stack (spaced) under a pile of my uncles stuff. And check the moisture content in the spring. Hopefully it will be ready to go.  The reason red oak is unacceptable is it lets water in the ends of the boards and rots really fast compared to white oak. Wich has a totaly different cell structure.  Theres gonna be a vintage 35 hp eatons viking hangin of the back.. Im building for strength.  I promise pictures to come
