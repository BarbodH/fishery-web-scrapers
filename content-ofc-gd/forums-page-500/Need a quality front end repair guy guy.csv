613416,F7Firecat,2011-08-18 23:22:00,347,ok thanks!
613418,irishfield,2011-08-18 23:25:00,26272,Pending the boat size.. someone could even run to the Pete Peterson boat launch dock with the boat and after dropping your truck you can just walk across the road and about 300 feet to the ramp for the ride/fish back to HHarbour.
613421,F7Firecat,2011-08-18 23:30:00,347,I will definitely entertain that Wayne.  Thanks for the help.  Bryan

The boat launch is clear across the street beside the ball diamond. You can see the walk path to it from behind what is a sales office trailer across the street from Adco.  This narrow channel is beside the sailing club.. dead center as you come in to the bottom of Midland Harbour. "
