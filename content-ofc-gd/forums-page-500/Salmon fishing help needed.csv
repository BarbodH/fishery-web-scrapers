613051,Pikeslayer,2011-08-17 21:47:00,1443,"Can anyone recommend any books, videos or DVDs on how to catch lake Ontario salmon? I have some fellow OFC members booked on trip trades this weekend and would like to at least look like I know what I'm doing. Any tips on lures and tackle would be helpful too. Would worms and bobbers work? Where would be a good place to rent a boat? Do you need a license? Where should I fish? It looks like a kinda big lake out there! GSP thingies would be appreciated.  Any help is greatly appreciated and advice (no matter how bad) is welcome.  Thx in advance,  Slayer"
