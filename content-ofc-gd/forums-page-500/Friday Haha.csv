After two visits and exhaustive Lab tests, he said I was doingâ€™ fairly well' for my age. (I will soon turn Sixty -Two).  A little concerned about that comment, I couldn't resist asking him, 'Do you think I'll live to be 80?'  He asked, 'Do you smoke tobacco, or drink beer, wine or hard liquor?'  'Oh no,' I replied. 'I'm not doing drugs, either!'  Then he asked, 'Do you eat rib-eye steaks and barbecued ribs?'  'I said, 'Not much... my former doctor said that all red meat is very unhealthy!'  'Do you spend a lot of time in the sun, like playing golf, boating, fishing, hiking, or bicycling?'  'No, I don't,' I said.  He asked, 'Do you gamble, drive fast cars, or have a lots of sex?'  'No,' I said...  He looked at me and said,..   ""Then, why do you even care?"""
