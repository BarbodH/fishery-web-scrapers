611882,stasbrute,2011-08-13 17:09:00,206,"What a great afternoon on the Upper, the lake was rough at Crystal so we launched at Fort Erie. The Smallies were on!! typical baits, tubes (dark colours). Around Strawberry Island I decided to put on a small Muskie bait (small Grandma lure) and troll for a bit, maybe pick up a small ski or a large walleye or bass. Just as I am taking a bite of my sandwich SLAM!! something hits the Grandma!! It was heavy, I am thinking ski or large walleye, it's not coming up. I get it up to the boat and its a monster smallie. John hoists in the net, its aboard, and we giggle like school girls. It measured 22.5 inches long and an incredible 19 inch girth, what a pig. Lots of bass were caught in the 2 to 3 lb range by both of us and to cap the evening off, I picked up a 22 inch Wally at the river mouth before getting off the water at around 9pm.  here are the pictures                     "
