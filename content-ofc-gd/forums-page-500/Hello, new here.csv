613322,mercman,2011-08-18 18:30:00,7054, Albert.....Are you in Crisis again?
613324,mercman,2011-08-18 18:31:00,7054,Especially if you keep launching your boat the way you seem to be doing it. The boat is used for fishing....not the truck
613326,HTHM,2011-08-18 18:34:00,4082,"What do you mean ""Again?"""
613329,Oryx,2011-08-18 18:42:00,186,"  The truck was borrowed, I told him I washed it inside and out.  That and he owed me $20 for the engine shampoo."
613333,Joey,2011-08-18 18:50:00,9122,Welcome Aboard
613336,Headhunter,2011-08-18 18:59:00,5703,"Yah, but did the trailor hubs get wet?! HH"
613337,Oryx,2011-08-18 19:00:00,186,"Nope, I'm careful like that"
612980,Oryx,2011-08-17 17:06:00,186,"Good Day,  I just joined up and wanted to introduce myself I have been enjoying the topics on the forums and some of the humour that is present.  it is nice to see a laid back forum with a vast knowledge base.  A little bit about me.  Live in Pickering, I Just bought my first boat, a little older, but new to me. I love fishing, but am no good at it.  I am originally from the Picton area and have NEVER fished the Bay of Quinte. Looking forward to reading alot more posts and learning from others.  Cheers  J"
612981,ccmtcanada,2011-08-17 17:10:00,7971,"Welcome to the board!! You will like it here...lots of knowledge for sure.  If you get to know people, before you know it you'll have new fishing partners as well.  I have met many on here who I now consider great friends and I have learned so much from them.  We like pictures...so if you have any...post them!  Start out with your boat maybe!  Cliff"
612985,Terry,2011-08-17 17:20:00,14456,welcome aboard
612986,asdve23rveavwa,2011-08-17 17:24:00,2690,Welcome to the board!!
612987,grimsbylander,2011-08-17 17:26:00,3016,"  Oh man, I was hoping you could help us!!  Welcome aboard!! You'll get good solid advice here Oryx."
612989,Oryx,2011-08-17 17:37:00,186,"Thanks for the warm welcome.  I would love to post some pics of the boat, but it is sitting in storage until the 29th in Deseronto. Until then, no fishing or boating for me.  The boat itself is a 93' Fisher SV 3 SC. 17.5 ' with a 90hp Merc,  9.9 kicker, a craptacularly old motorguide trolling motor on the bow and the fishfinders make the pong game look like hi-def.  It is fun though!  And beats the hell out of shore fishing."
612991,grimsbylander,2011-08-17 17:42:00,3016,"  The fish don't know the difference. Sounds like a great boat and you'll have fun with it. Oh, and I have the same electronics on my boat! Next year I'll invest the $$ maybe $$$$ on a better unit."
612992,ccmtcanada,2011-08-17 17:43:00,7971,"Craptacular?  Pong?? LOL  You'll fit right in here!!  If the trolling motor trolls, and the fishfinder finds bottom then it's all good!"
612993,NAW,2011-08-17 17:47:00,4022,Oryx like the bike??   Welcome aboard man!
612994,fishnsled,2011-08-17 17:52:00,3520,You can still get Pong??!! Where!!??  If all is working on the boat - all is well.   Welcome aboard.
612996,Oryx,2011-08-17 18:02:00,186," That's right.  Was my first racing Mountain Bike, liked the name so much, I use it for pretty much all my forum handles."
612997,misfish,2011-08-17 18:04:00,29133,"Welcome aboard. Nothing wrong with that vessel.Fisher is a good boat.      LOL Yep,walk to the fridge,grab a cold one and be back before the ball was returned to you."
612998,grimsbylander,2011-08-17 18:06:00,3016,"  Tried beer pong?? from what I remember, its fun."
613000,Headhunter,2011-08-17 18:08:00,5703,"Welcome! Quinte eh? Well it's a good thing you never fished it cause everyone knows, there's no fish in that body of water... especially Pickereyes! Lookin forward to your posts! HH"
613003,Oryx,2011-08-17 18:29:00,186,"  Thanks for the vote of confidence in the boat, As the interwebs have sweet nothing for information on them.  The only thing I do know is that it was built by Brunswick (Mercury) and they sold the brand to Tracker (Bass Pro) in 1999."
613008,adolson,2011-08-17 18:56:00,783, Is it a Humminbird LCR4ID!?! That's what I have! Red and black Tetris bricks FTW
613012,Oryx,2011-08-17 19:00:00,186," Not even close, pure greyscale here.  Humminbird Platinum ID"
613014,Rod Caster,2011-08-17 19:07:00,5784,Welcome aboard. Enjoy the boat... it beats a sportspal canoe in many ways. Cheers.
613023,mercman,2011-08-17 19:47:00,7054,"Welcome Oryx. From what i've seen, you will fit right in Sounds to me like a nice Vessel you have.Comfort when fishing is top priority, and they are a good comfortable boat to fish out of.   PAUL  "
613046,crappieperchhunter,2011-08-17 21:22:00,2582,"Welcome. Come on in sit down, relax and enjoy.  Good group here and newcomers are always welcome. Good luck when you get your boat in the water."
613064,limeyangler,2011-08-17 22:27:00,5204,Welcome to the site
613101,HTHM,2011-08-17 23:27:00,4082,"Why is everyone being so welcoming????? The guy has to pay his dues first, don't you remember what it was like for you?!! Just because he sounds like everyone of us, ""Not good at fishing, but I like it"" and is able to turn a phrase very well, apparently, does not mean we should stand here with open arms and just let him into the group. I have HAD it with guys who have a sense of humour being welcomed like this. Heck, it took YEARS for me to be accepted, (and I'm not sure if I am yet).  OH BTW - welcome to the board, you gonna fit right in! I LOVE the PONG line - classic! The best piece of advice I have ever heard regarding fishing - ""If your hooks not in the water, you're not gonna catch a thing"" Good luck and have fun here."
613111,adolson,2011-08-17 23:38:00,783," I keep telling my cousin that, and he wonders why he still hasn't caught a bass."
613294,Pickeral eater,2011-08-18 16:42:00,155,"Welcome! I myself am new and received a warm welcome as well.  I'm pretty new to the sport and am picking up lots of info from other members. Tonnes of knowledge, experience and tips on this site. Enjoy Bill"
613306,Oryx,2011-08-18 17:32:00,186,"It is gonna be tough on my wife (banker) very soon.  I work in Woodbridge 3 Mins from BassPro, and they are opening up a Sail beside my workplace....our mortgage will never be paid off!"
