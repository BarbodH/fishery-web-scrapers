I expected the hot summer to make fishing tough but it has been a really productive summer out there. I think I left off at my crankbait day on Couchiching, so from there I went to fish a tournament on Lake Dalrymple.  We started the morning fishing shallow docks and pads throwing a combination of flipping jigs and frogs.  After only a couple of small fish, we went to the deeper weeds in 7-11 feet and started fishing jigs slowly in the thickest spots.  We quickly picked up a 14-15 pound limit, but needed some bigger girls to cash some coin.  Around 2pm we hit the shallow stuff again with jig in hand.  We ended up pounding them as a wave of fish seemed to move up for the afternoon.  Ended up weighing 18.63 for second place.  Since then, my mind has been on Simcoe.  I've come across a pattern that seems to be working really, really well and I'm trying new locations around the lake with similar features and it has been producing quality fish.  This lake never ceases to amaze me.  I'm getting the fish on a mix of XZone Slammers, tubes and deep diving crankbaits.  Enjoy the pics and the video, I appeciate all feedback.                  I'll be adding more photos from yesterday as they are sent to me"
