Its definitely a different way to fish and I found it quite enjoyable using his craft.  After using his, I’m thinking of upgrading mine so if anyone has one that they don’t use, drop me a PM.  I would be interested if the price is right.  Fishing was mediocre.  IT was our first time there and man, there is a lot of boat traffic there.  For such a small lake, I’m surprised that big power boats are allowed.  Just a couple hammer handles and that was it.  Lots of fellow anglers as well but I didn’t see anyone get much.  Anyone else have decent luck at this place?"
