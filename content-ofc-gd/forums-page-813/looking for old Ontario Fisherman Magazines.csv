364679,quickme,2009-07-21 14:20:00,261,do you care what condition they are in?  I may have some stored in my parents basement...  they are NOT ripped and torn but i'm sure the corners are alittle bent...  Let me know..  I'll try to visit the folks sometime in the next 2 weeks.  Nick

He came and picked them up, but i can't remember who it was!  If I find a few more around the house or up North,I will gladly give you first shot at them!  They were a good read back then and those were the years I mainly kept."
