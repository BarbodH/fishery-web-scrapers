363896,bigugli,2009-07-19 10:38:00,6138,"In the pond, take 2 approaches.  1)  the float.  worm set just off the bottom so it drifts and moves with the wind. If using corn  have hook resting on bottom with a little slack to give a cat or carp time take the bait. Use a micro tube on a slip float gradually twitching it back to you. The rise and fall of that tube can be effective. 2) casting.  Try a couple of varieties of spinnerbaits, twitch bait, popper, floating rapala, etc...  Use both slow and fast retrieves to try and entice a surface strike.  These are just standard tactics for working any shallow pond or pool."

364368,TC1OZ,2009-07-20 17:32:00,987,"I'm a big fan of just using a smaller hook (not too small) with a 1/3 of a worm (i like to hide all of the hook and knot except for the tip) and about 2 feet up two little weights. Then just cast, wait for it to sink a bit, and then reel in fairly slow!  Hope you have some good luck!"
