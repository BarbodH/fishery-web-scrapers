Fishing was slooooooowwwwwwwwww...  Smallie hits were barely detectable, often it was just a sudden dead weight.  Most fish taken on white twister tails slowly dragged along the bottom while drifting, a new pattern for this lake.   All in all we boated about about 10 including my new PB smallie.  Just over 22.5"" and just about as girthy...lol...   "
