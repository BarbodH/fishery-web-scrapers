Unfortunately I've only gone fishing 3 times all year  ....next summer should be different going to northern Quebec or Labrador for 3-4 weeks!!  Our new Suzuki Grand Vitara V6-JLX    Our new cat enclosure which the cats love!!!   And the new pond which is how we spent Canada Day and several days after.....solid clay   Had to use the jack hammer to bring it down 40"" so the gold fish can survive the winter freeze.    "
365384,markiemark70,2009-07-23 12:58:00,158,Sweet I live backyard ponds. I used to have one at my old place and it was so relaxing to sit out there and watch the fish. I cold spend an hour out there. Someday I will have another one. Good job.  And the cat enclosure is a cool idea too. Is there a way for them to get out to it directly from the house? I always wanted to do that so that we did not have to have the litter box inside.
365389,blaque,2009-07-23 13:12:00,2419,"Dude, forget the new car, lol...........that cat enclosure is one of the coolest ideas ive seen lol  I have an ""inside"" cat.........and let her out on the porch but as soon as i have to get up to go do something and cant watch her, she is up on the railing and trying to get down on the grass to graze lol. She wont take off, but loves to eat her grass and of course puke it back up. That is one great idea to give them outdoor time but not have to babysit. Never seen anything like it. Great idea."
365395,Basskicker,2009-07-23 13:23:00,421, Thanks...I installed a cat door through the side of the house......with a double flap (actually amazingly weather proof) from Home Depot  
365415,gdelongchamp,2009-07-23 14:02:00,199,  Check out the articles in google regarding raising tilapia in back yard ponds like yours. Very interesting. And a good eating fish. Grows fast. 
365423,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-23 14:10:00,3761,"Cool pond, very nice...I would want a pond I could fish and stock myself, but that's not likely to happen lol. As for the new car, she looks nice, and well....at least it was purchased in Canada.   MTBF"

365435,solopaddler,2009-07-23 14:31:00,8605,Wow bud you said you'd been busy....you weren't kidding!  Nice vehicle and great job on the pond and encloseure!
365441,Radnine,2009-07-23 14:48:00,1538,I love the watering can sprinkler idea in the pond. But I thought cat houses were illegal Jim
365448,TC1OZ,2009-07-23 15:09:00,987,"  It's outdoor storage, the cats just enjoy playing in it!"
