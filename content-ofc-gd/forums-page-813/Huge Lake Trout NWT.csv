George Kenny and his son Jordon, 13, caught the huge trout while fishing near Broken Plate Creek along the Great Bear Lake. The lake is home to the biggest lake trout in the world.  Kenny said his son was a bit startled when he first spotted the large trout.  He was kind of scared of it, Kenny told CBC News on Monday. But I told him its only a bit alive. Its not going to do nothing.  Kenny said the trout was badly tangled in the net. He tried to return the fish to the water but it wouldn't come around. So he brought it back to Deline and weighed it.  Word of the large catch quickly spread through the community. People came out to see and photograph the giant fish.  Kenny said he caught an even bigger trout last year but he returned that one to the water.  The Deline Land Corporation plans to mount the fish, Kenny said."
364801,Cudz,2009-07-21 20:05:00,2652,with a net??  Too bad. I believe a 102 lb was netted there as well.   That fish must be 1000000 years old.

364811,TC1OZ,2009-07-21 20:45:00,987,Looks like he was trolling with a net....I'm guess he was either working for a company? or hes native and they don't have laws.....

364834,charlied,2009-07-21 22:48:00,584,Too bad they didn't let it go back to the deep!!!
364851,Paully,2009-07-21 23:41:00,712,Biggest fresh Lake Trout in the World  caught in Lake Athabasca  102lb and 6 Oz in the year 1963 
365067,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-22 15:41:00,10439,  Easy now!!!! There is no commercial fishery on GBL. He was subsistance fishing for his family. If I wanted to I could get a subsistance netting permit and I'm not native. Things work a lot differently up here than they do in Southern Ontario.
