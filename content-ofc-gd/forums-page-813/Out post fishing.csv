365279,irishfield,2009-07-23 02:28:00,26272,"Also remember if there is a slot size on the lake you are fishing that you have to retain the whole thing gutted to prove it's not a slot fish...  As for confusion... I said yes because if they wanna go in they're gonna and I haven't bothered to look for the actual Ontario Regs but it was at least at one time a no warrant issue to come in and check a freezer or garage for illegal hunted deer/etc. You shouldn't have anything to hide anyhow and keep in mind they are trying to protect YOUR fishery. I don't see Wil (fishnsled) too bent out of shape about it and he's the one with the fine. Probably worth looking into though as he wasn't transporting... but someone in his group might have said ""we've kept a couple to take home"" !"
365281,TJQ,2009-07-23 02:35:00,7806,I have been on numerous fly ins and have never been inspected.  I think that is an answer to your question.
365284,irishfield,2009-07-23 02:36:00,26272,"1. Fish caught and retained may be gilled and gutted but fish length must be readily measurable at all times for fish taken from waterbodies where size limits are in effect, unless the fish:  are being prepared for immediate consumption; are prepared at an overnight accommodation for storage; are being transported on the water from a temporary overnight accommodation to that person's primary residence and that person is NOT engaged in sport fishing; or; are being transported overland.  2. In addition, when packaging all fish for transport or storage, anglers must ensure that a Conservation Officer can determine:  the number of fish that you have; the species that you have in your possession.  When Packaging Fish, Anglers Should:  Leave a large patch of the skin on all fillets for identification; Pack or freeze fish separately and flat so that they can be counted and identified (clear plastic bags or clear plastic wrap is preferred).  Conservation Officers  Conservation Officers have powers of inspection, arrest, search and seizure under the various statutes they enforce, including the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act and the Fisheries Act. When carrying out their duties Conservation Officers may do the following:  Stop and inspect a vehicle, boat or aircraft; Ask questions relevant to the inspection; Inspect buildings or other places; Search with a warrant; Search without a warrant in circumstances requiring immediate action; Seize items related to an offence; Arrest anyone the Conservation Officer believes has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offence.  Conservation Officers operate random ""Fish Check Stations"" throughout the year. At these stations, Conservation Officers collect information on fish caught by anglers and make sure the regulations are obeyed in order to manage and protect Ontario's fisheries resources.  Police Officers appointed under the Police Services Act, RCMP Officers, National Wildlife Officers, National Park Wardens and Conservation Officers of all border states and provinces are designated Conservation Officers in Ontario."
365285,Dara,2009-07-23 02:40:00,3052,"  Me neither, but don't think you never will be."
365322,Jonny,2009-07-23 03:37:00,1380," Well that's pretty clear, thanks. I read that a while ago but forgot about it in this context.    So much for all the stories we hear about what a CO can and can't do. He can do basically anything he wants, with what he considers to be reasonable grounds. The worst that can happen is that the charge is thrown out IN COURT, with not much repercussion for the CO, but expense in time and money for you."
365332,irishfield,2009-07-23 04:21:00,26272, Yep the Canadian Judicial system.... but sure better than Saudi Arabia where they just cut your hand off...
365336,Jonny,2009-07-23 04:38:00,1380,"Talking to a CO is kind of like the customs check when crossing (either way) between Canada and the USA. You get asked some simple questions, your attitude and nervousness are judged, there's a look for anything that seems out-of-kilter, and you either get waved through or you're pulled over for a thorough check."
365360,doack,2009-07-23 11:40:00,46," Thanks TJ, those are the types of answers I was looking for.  I have been going on fly-ins for 20 years up in Ontario, and never had one come in.  That is why when I saw a thread on another site about it happening pretty frequently I thought I would come over here and see what the board members are seeing or hearing.  Any other comments along these lines would be appreciated.  It just doesn't seem right to go in and ruin someones vacation when they are the only people on the lake, and having a few beers while fishing all day."
365361,Fish4Eyes,2009-07-23 11:45:00,1022,"They definetely don't need a warrant to enter. Some of the senior board members will remember this, but a while back a CO went into Anglers Kingdom and demanded that the owner open the door to one of the cabins when the people were not even there to have a look in the freezer.  Its always possible for them to land in. You do see them coming though, so use that to your advantage if you can. Although I'm sure they are watching you with binoculars before they even land to see if your nervous and panicking. Get drunk before you go out if your that worried about it."
365376,Whopper,2009-07-23 12:31:00,2174," TJ I've been on numerous flyins and although I haven't been personally checked (on a flyin) about four or five years ago we had a plane land which had both a CO and OPP officers on the plane, they checked three of the four boats in our group and also checked the cabin freezer without anyone being present in the cabin, seemed they were only there to check for licenses and possession fish which our group was good on. They didn't make an issue about beer in the boat at the time which they could have, but I have a feeling that if the same thing happened today they wouldn't look the other way about the beer. We've had a CO waiting at base camp on our return from an outpost to check creel limits as well with no problems. From what I've heard and read this happens more in northwestern part of Ontario, just my opinion. Fisheyes is correct too about Co's coming into outpost camps and checking cabins without permission or warrants, there is a certain CO that likes to visit Sportsmans Lodge and Anglers Kingdom north of Red Lake, it happens every year. Last year we were stopped by CO's and OPP's  just south of Ear Falls (HWY 105) and they were stopping everyone going south for a fish check again no problems for us (no fish) but they were writing tickets to everyone not in compliance with the regs.  doack I'm not going to tell ya that it's not impossible for you to get a visitor but then again the chances are slim.  Good Luck on your trip and I hope you enjoy yourself"
365401,doack,2009-07-23 13:30:00,46,"  Thanks Whopper, we will do so, and again, I am not real worried about it, we do have a few (2-4 during the day) and just don't want the hassle if they are coming in more frequently.  Sounds like we will be ok, just keep the cans out of the boat when done with them.  And no, I won't throw them in the lake lol.    Take care all."
365424,Jonny,2009-07-23 14:11:00,1380, I think you might get a visit this time.
365426,Dara,2009-07-23 14:18:00,3052,  yep...bring your cheque book
365458,doack,2009-07-23 15:37:00,46,"   lol, didn't think that one through."
365467,Jay T,2009-07-23 16:00:00,282, I can't believe you come on hear to ask your question about drinking in a vessel while out fishing. Then give up your location where you will be You are a
365505,doack,2009-07-23 17:03:00,46, Gee thanks bud....
364658,doack,2009-07-21 12:33:00,46,"Anyone ever been stopped at a only cabin on a lake type fly in trip for alcohol, or general check?  Just curious, we have been going up for 20 years, and never had a problem. Reading on another board a thread about how they are checking outposts much more frequently, and if they land, they will do their damnedest to find something to ticket.  Just curious, don't want lectures, or pissing matches, just curious if anyone has seen this happening more.  We usually have a handful of beers out while fishing all day, but it sounds like you better not have an empty can or open beer or you will have big troubles.  Just curious."
364747,doack,2009-07-21 17:49:00,46,"You can tell if you have or haven't been checked, its ok!  Just looking for some feedback."
364776,TC1OZ,2009-07-21 19:02:00,987,Are you talking about open beer on a boat?
364781,fishnsled,2009-07-21 19:19:00,3520,"Had the MNR fly in a couple of years ago.  4 fish in the cabin (between 5 guys) that they wanted to see, no skin on the fish, $125 fine.  As for the beers in the boat, the laws of the province would apply although I haven't heard of the OPP dropping in on these lakes.  Not to say they wouldn't but perhaps they have bigger fish to fry so to speak."
364782,Toronto_Angler,2009-07-21 19:28:00,698,I believe open alcohol in a boat is just as bad as open alcohol in a car. I know too many people who have lost loved ones as a result of alcohol related accidents whether on the water or the road.
364786,irishfield,2009-07-21 19:37:00,26272,CO has the authority now to lay liquor charges and you're darn tootin that those yellow Beavers gets around... 
364804,TC1OZ,2009-07-21 20:14:00,987,"I wasn't sure if thats what he was asking...  But yes, getting caught with open beers in your boat is just as bad as drinking beers in the car on the drive to the cottage"
364809,Handlebarz,2009-07-21 20:37:00,3790,Dang Wayne with them yellow beavers getting around so much I am glad I never fell into one of them or don't remember it anyway
364816,muskymatt,2009-07-21 21:11:00,2608, I thought it was only during transporting fish that you had to have a patch of skin on them???  You couldn't have told them they were for supper that night??  That sound a bit much to get a ticket for that...I'd have some choice words for them that's for sure.....
364991,Fish4Eyes,2009-07-22 11:52:00,1022,"They have to have skin on them right up until you are about to cook them. So if you don't plan on cooking them right away, keep a patch of skin on them."
364993,doack,2009-07-22 11:59:00,46," So are you talking a one cabin only outpost fly in camp?  I agree out on the water with other boaters around is a real bad thing, and I am not talking about be drunk off my ass.  But at a true outpost camp, with only your group on it, you really look at having a couple of beers in the boat during your day as a horrible offense?  Again, not what I was looking for in info, just curious if guys  have had them drop in and check out your boats, camps, and such looking for a ticket reason.  This is what the thread on another board was about, and there were a lot of mixed messages on it.  Take care all, any responses on having them swoop in on your private camp for the week would be appreciated."
365110,camillj,2009-07-22 19:09:00,1988,It happens ... just often enough to keep you honest
365114,Dara,2009-07-22 19:23:00,3052,"I have had them swoop in on me in winter fishing in Lake Superior Provincial Park. You can generally see them coming, but I have heard they can cut the engine and come in pretty quiet. or sneak in over the trees.  For the guy that got busted for no skin in camp. I would have gone to court over that one. Thats a load of crap."
365160,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-22 21:26:00,10439,"  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, and it's a SWEET Turbo Beaver to boot!!!!"
365179,fisherman7,2009-07-22 22:21:00,325,"They stopped in on us north of Hearst. One guy was an absolute dick, but the other's were OK."
365186,misfish,2009-07-22 22:49:00,29133," Yellow beaver? Sounds nasty.  Leave the beer and drinks for the cabin,or the cuddy.LOL"
365188,Jonny,2009-07-22 22:59:00,1380," That one surprised the hell out of me. Isn't your camp your home for the time you've rented it? I can see having to have patches of skin on fish that are being taken along at the end of the trip, but not this!"
365194,lunders,2009-07-22 23:18:00,33, Wow... Sounds like some clowns from MNR there... Can they just go ahead and check your cabin for fish like that? No warrant needed?
365196,irishfield,2009-07-22 23:19:00,26272, YES!
365199,moose,2009-07-22 23:22:00,266,thr only time when i heard of this when there were complaints from the owner of camp or canoers that they stop to check things out
365200,Ziki,2009-07-22 23:25:00,128, What about the charter?
365210,irishfield,2009-07-22 23:57:00,26272,Here's the first one I found without wasting much time on it.   They are supposed to have a warrant to search a building.. but most figure they haven't done anything wrong and just let them in as I figure was the case with fishnsled.
365271,Dara,2009-07-23 02:11:00,3052,"  Key words are ""reasonable and probable grounds that an offence has been commited""  Thats why you don't invite them in for coffee. They get comfy, chatting, asking how the fishing is. oh, can i see em. They didn't fly all the way in there to not get the gas paid for."
365274,Jonny,2009-07-23 02:18:00,1380," Confusing. First you said YES they can enter the cabin. Now you say they need a warrant.  Here's the situation I see developing if you refuse entry: The CO's call in the OPP with a warrant, on the grounds that they think you're hiding something. Neat way to ruin your holiday --- especially if you think you haven't done anything wrong.  Seems like the only way to keep some of these buggers off your back, even though you're doing more than what the regulations require, is keep a good sized patch of skin on every fillet or piece of fillet until it's ready to go into the pan or until you have it at home (your legal residence). Even better, leave the fillets intact and leave ALL the skin on. I can see that being a gooey mess with pike but not so bad for other fish."
365278,Dara,2009-07-23 02:28:00,3052,"They can go in your cabin, but they need to have reasonable grounds to believe an offense has been committed. Like the guys down the lake saying they saw you with 30 or 40 walleyes. Or they saw you carrying a heck of a stringer into camp.  Or if you invite em in"
