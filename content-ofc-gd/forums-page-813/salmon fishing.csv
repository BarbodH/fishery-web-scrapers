There is also some advantage to the no stretch properties of the braid at those depths.  On the flip side, the no stretch properties may not be ideal when running higher (<80') as when large fish strike hard they put a great deal of stress on the system, very quickly.......so, some stretch can be quite helpful.  Personally, I run mono off the riggers and reserve the braid for the dipseys or the torpedo divers. I will run an SWR off the riggers from time to time, which is a combination of mono and a couple of colours of core.  Experiment and find out what works for you.  Tightlines!"

They're only a problem once the water warms up, but they'll stick to braid like nobodys business, wire or a thick slippery line like 30lb. Big Game is the only way to deal with them.  Run braid through a bad patch of fleas and it will look like a foot of elephant snot got caught on your rod."
