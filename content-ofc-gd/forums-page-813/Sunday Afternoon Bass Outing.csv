361669,Fishing 24/7,2009-07-13 20:32:00,709,Love how you put this one together paul!  Im still tromatized with yesterdays outting.  its funny how this happened to so many people befor.  finaly happened to us.!  Here are a couple of picture i took with my camera.    paul lipping what seems to be a BEAST! ended up beeing a 2 lbs bass!  had to get the joker to put a smile on whitespinnerbaits face for this one!    a pair of 2.8 lbs bass! Twins caught back to back on the famous northam spinnerbaits White!  Here is another funny story.  that 4.8 im holding up regurgitated a perch that was longer than some bass we were getting.  so add a seriouse 3 to 4 ounces on that bass and shes a 4.11!  not bad HEIN?!?!  she was caught on a 5'' black sinking minnow '' GULP'' wacky style! fishing a big log in the middle of a bay!

We started off working the shorelines using the Famous Northam SpinnerBaits , sure enough the bass were on the feed , first Bass of the day    I guess this loon dropped by to see what all the fuss was about...    Mid morning we moved out and starting Gulping the logs ....  Can you say Bucket Mouth...      I decided to throw on a White Big-o , First cast I get a hit = a one pound bass as it nears the boat .....Bang !!!! A 7lb pike comes out of nowhere and tries to take off with '' My '' bass   :angry:      24/7 reaches down and picks up the Long water snake .......  :wacko:      Bass Rat     The bass seem to be somewhat more active ..............Finally !!!!!   :worthy:  :worthy:"
