365471,ironstone74,2009-07-23 16:03:00,201,I have used Gulp Leeches several times for Smallmouth in rivers without any luck.  How do you guys rig them and present them for SMB???  Thanks  Paul

365516,Cudz,2009-07-23 17:37:00,2652,drop shot.  I do not go through the sucker hole as I find you lose too many too quickly.  I actually thread it on the hook like you would a worm.  I used them today in the rain and went 4 for 8.

365523,Cudz,2009-07-23 18:03:00,2652,"I use both. I have better success with the 3""  but they are both good."
