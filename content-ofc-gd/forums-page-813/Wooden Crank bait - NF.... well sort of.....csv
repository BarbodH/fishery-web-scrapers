364662,snag,2009-07-21 13:00:00,1932,"Nice job Leechy  I might just give that a try with the kids in the family.  Cheers,  S.  "
364666,limeyangler,2009-07-21 13:21:00,5204,Thats flippin' AWESOME Jacques.  cant wait to here how it makes out on your trip to sis's cottage.
364688,TC1OZ,2009-07-21 14:47:00,987,I predict fish!  Nice work!
364695,LeXXington,2009-07-21 15:03:00,1928,"Very nice, hope it works for you."
364697,Joey,2009-07-21 15:06:00,9122,"That's really great.  I like the looks of it     You should be proud of yourself, that's a job very well done.  Joey"
364716,wallyboss,2009-07-21 15:50:00,1095,"Good work Jacques,  To try it out remove the treble and go to visit somebody that has a pool.   on your next prototype you might want to bring the treble ahead to the bump on the under side and find a way to put a single hook on the back end as a trailer hook."
364725,bigugli,2009-07-21 16:10:00,6138,Looks good.   Mee's a like
364766,Leecher,2009-07-21 18:44:00,7832,"Thanks again folks for your kind replies I promise to post a report of the outcome!!!   Thanks Dan!!!  That is a good advice for trying it in a pool and for the hooks, well just want to try it this way for now but I'll keep this suggestion on the back burner for future one depending on the results. Thanks again everyone!!! Leechman"
364774,wallyboss,2009-07-21 18:58:00,1095,"Hook it's only because I like to have one on the tail  for short biters.  About the pool , I used to have a pool  and just before winterizing it I used to test all my new ice lures so I would know how to work them."
364827,splashhopper,2009-07-21 22:07:00,2931,"great colours on that ""little woody"""
364836,solopaddler,2009-07-21 22:57:00,8605,"Nice job on The Little Woody Jacques!  Here's mine, it's 14 inches long and has an incredible action.  I call it THE BIG BONER.  "
364874,JohnF,2009-07-22 00:30:00,3494, Something that long should have tail planes to keep it level.  JF
364892,Leecher,2009-07-22 01:17:00,7832, Thanks Mike!!!  The big Boner of yours looks pretty good     Have you landed any fishes with it??  Today just made a couple more with a slight variation of colors on the dots..... still have to give it another coat of varnish and then will be posting the pics.  Thanks again everyone!!! Leechman
364899,The Urban Fisherman,2009-07-22 01:28:00,2050,That's awesome Jacques! Hope you don't mind but I'm going to totally rip off your idea and give my own lures a go!  Keep us posted as per your results!
364907,Leecher,2009-07-22 01:42:00,7832," Thanks Ryan It's OK, I don't mind and totally understand LOL"
364929,Leecher,2009-07-22 02:30:00,7832,Just finished a couple more and made one a little bigger.  Ran out of red and black stickers so used blue instead     Also positioned the eyes a little higher on the head!!!  Here's a couple of pics      Hope you enjoy! Leechman
364958,Jonny,2009-07-22 03:34:00,1380,I made one of my own lures a while back - a musky lure of all things. I may have the courage to post it some time.
365060,Leecher,2009-07-22 15:19:00,7832, Please do Jocko.... would like to see it.
365066,LucG,2009-07-22 15:31:00,779,I want to see a fish hanging from one of those hand made lures
365105,chuckymcd,2009-07-22 18:48:00,144,"AWSOME! ive been thinging about trying this for a while, you might have got me motivated now"
365305,Leecher,2009-07-23 03:10:00,7832, I sure hope that it can    Just need the weather to cooperate   Thanks Fins and Skins!!!  Please post your creation when you do
365324,Cudz,2009-07-23 03:44:00,2652,Ok. Now we need to see something.  Either a vid to see it moving in the water or a pic of a fish with it in its mouth.
365326,Jonny,2009-07-23 03:47:00,1380," Well I'd have to dig it out of a box and get a picture of it. But I just might do that.  People tie their own flies, so I'm surprised we don't hear of more people who put their woodworking and artistic skills to use skills to use and create their own lures.  Did you catch this thread a while back?... It involves painting of an already-manufactured lure but I still thought it was neat! ...  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...c=34127&hl="
365328,Leecher,2009-07-23 04:03:00,7832," Ok Cudz, I promise to have pics and a video (if weather permits) of it in the water this weekend.... only 3 Dodo's to go LOL  No I did not catch this thread and it looks awesome!!!  Thanks for posting it"
364219,Leecher,2009-07-20 03:40:00,7832,"After coming back from CTC this morning and buying another load of fishing tackle for the up coming trip to my sister's cottage, got thinking about the prices of lures and how expensive they are and thought I could copy my favorite crank bait and make a wooden one.  Well I started right away with this idea that I could carve it out with a knife and I did try for the longest time but the results were not even close to what I had anticipated..... So I went down to the basement and got my band saw and trace the contour of the lure onto a piece of pine wood and got busy.....  Well let me tell ya that after cutting the piece of wood on the saw, the results was a real joy....  Had to hand sand the piece for a few hours to my likings and truly like the end results.  Here is the piece that I made.... it looks very similar to a BigO with some modifications and will call this one "" a wooden plug ""  as I do not have a name for it yet LOL    and again different angle    I still have to paint it and varnish it for the trial run this upcoming weekend and hope that I can finish it in time. Hope you enjoy! Leechman"
364228,Jonny,2009-07-20 03:55:00,1380,Should be fun trying to catch a fish on something you made yourself. Good Luck!  My suggestion for a name: The Little Woody.
364229,Rich,2009-07-20 03:57:00,3927,"Good job.  Will it dive with the wooden bill? I used to whittle topwater baits out of pine when I was at the cottage in my downtime. The flatfish imitations always did well for us.  My only suggestion is putting a couple of hooks on, for counter-balance purposes and also just to hook more fish."
364238,Leecher,2009-07-20 04:14:00,7832," Thanks Jocko.... but I think I'll keep ""wooden plug""  for now    Thanks for the suggestion   Thanks Rich.... don't know if it will dive.... will be trying it this up coming weekend.  but I think it will, it's got a big enough bill... just like the real thing.  I will report back with the results Leechman"
364255,Gerritt,2009-07-20 11:33:00,6129,bring some sandpaper or a knife to tune it when you give her a shot!.. nice looking little project there. Good Luck!
364267,splashhopper,2009-07-20 12:13:00,2931, I second that name
364269,bushart,2009-07-20 12:16:00,2628,Looks Good Leechman  What are you going to use for a ring to tie your line to?--Are you going with a small eyescrew into the body or something through the bill.  Are you painting it White?  Bushart
364274,Cudz,2009-07-20 12:28:00,2652,Or Morning Wood Looks cool.
364288,Mike Pike,2009-07-20 13:03:00,1332,What a great project Leechman!  Should be fun giving 'er a trial run and then paintin' 'er up!  Looking forward to hearing about how she works for ya and seeing the final product.  Good luck!
364289,Radnine,2009-07-20 13:10:00,1538,"Jacques, You have an opportunity here to test the theory about it being the movement that catches the fish over the pattern painted on the lure. Give it a go with no paint and see what happens. You could single handedly change the way that we all think about fishing (and destroy the lure making industry). Looks like a fun project anyway you go. Jim"
364297,JohnF,2009-07-20 13:37:00,3494, Save that name fer yer first musky lure.  JF
364520,Leecher,2009-07-21 00:14:00,7832,"Thanks everyone for your kind comments!!!  This weekend will be the true test and just can't wait   Bushart I will be using the eyescrew type into the top of the head for tying the line to and will be painting it white which is my favorite color.  ***** UPDATE ***** Got to the painting stage this morning and by the time I finished, my mom drop by for a visit for the afternoon and stayed for supper.  Could not come on line to post this update.  Here is the final product as far as it goes  All dressed up and ready for a good test after a couple of white coats and varnish....    another angle    I truly like the end results.... Hope you enjoy! Leechman"
364541,Leecher,2009-07-21 01:12:00,7832,"Well guys just did a water test, drop it into the bathroom sink and she floats    Leechman"
364544,Bernie,2009-07-21 01:16:00,3190,"Nice looking work there Leechman! An uncle used to make his musky lures. Caught one of his biggest ones on one that was natural wood color varnished. There is another guy on here that makes his own musky lures, very nice ones too.....right Roy?"
364548,Leecher,2009-07-21 01:25:00,7832," Thanks Bernie    Now I just have to try it this coming weekend.... Have confidence that it will work just like a real BigO would I thought I would've needed some lead in it to help stabilize it but after this trial, no need for it  Will report back later with the results!!! Leechman"
364553,Greencoachdog,2009-07-21 01:30:00,8163,"Excellent work Jacques!!!  Looks like you would give Norm Abrams a run for his money in the wood shop!  ... as for the name, I like ""Bite My Wood""!!!"
364558,Leecher,2009-07-21 01:37:00,7832," Thanks Glen Yeah the ""New Yankee Workshop"" is one of my favorite shows!!!  Thanks for your suggestion, much appreciated and noted! Jacques"
364559,Fishing 24/7,2009-07-21 01:41:00,709,Jaques put me up for an order of 10 of those woodies!   the wife told me i need them!       Great work BTW  cant wait to see how They worked out!  jaques isnt there a hook in the back usualy???
364562,misfish,2009-07-21 01:50:00,29133,Excellent work Jacques.  I like it my friend. Reminds me of the old school lures.
364565,Leecher,2009-07-21 01:54:00,7832," Thanks Kev    Let me test it first and then will talk production LOL Yes there's usually a couple of sets of treble hooks on them but wanted to make one with just one set.  Sometimes bass will inhale the lure when they strike and get the two treble inside their mouth, just want to avoid this and keep it simple.  Will report back on the results later on!!! Jacques"
364566,Leecher,2009-07-21 01:56:00,7832, Thanks Brian   It sure does
364603,ohhenrygsr,2009-07-21 03:20:00,947,Awesome job hope your field testing is on a lake with no pike or musky lol. Would hate to loose that on the first cast or snag on something lol.  Well you got many names for the bait. How about The Dirty lure Company as your company name lol.
364609,Leecher,2009-07-21 03:30:00,7832,"Thanks Henry The first cast will be close to the cottage on the shoreline where the smb lives!!! I think this lure will perform to what I expect it to do and if I hook into a fish.... that would be awesome Thanks also for your suggestion, it's duly noted Leechman"
364619,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-07-21 04:02:00,0,neat project.  hope to see a report with some fish caught on your creation.
364622,Leecher,2009-07-21 04:11:00,7832," Thanks Dr. Salvelinus All I hope is when I cast it out (I know it floats well) that when I start the retrieve, that it behaves like the real thing.... as for catching a fish.... well that would be bonus  Fish or no fish.... will be reporting of the outcome Leechman"
