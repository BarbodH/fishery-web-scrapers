365252,love2fishhave2work,2009-07-23 01:40:00,212,Fished a few days ago starting from Pickering and trolled my way to the Bluffs and back.  Went 3 for 7 with one large fish lost because the braid got caught in the real and the fish ran and snapped it.  The other 3 misses were just knock offs.  Did land 2 very nice fish and a shaker.  The two landed were 22 and 26 lbs.  One caught on a SD and white fly the other caught on a black and silver spoon.  Fish taken shallow in 70 ft of water and a bit deaper in 100 feet but all were in the 30 to 50 feet of water.  Here is a pic of one of them.
