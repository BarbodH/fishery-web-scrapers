364808,Calender Don,2009-07-21 20:33:00,39,The lower grand river has been slow lately I was wondering if the lake Erie has pick up yet and if so how far out do you have to go.
365107,doubleheader,2009-07-22 19:02:00,497,"I can't speak for most of the lake but around Erie PA it's been slower than usual, but some days have been pretty good. I think the weather has things kind of fouled up. Fish seem pretty scattered.  Here's a good website    http://www.fishlakeerie.com/"
365125,Bob Devine,2009-07-22 19:45:00,251,Not sure if you want to drive a bit but Leamington is giving up limits and Wheatley is going strong with rainbows and walleyes. 
365173,Billy Bob,2009-07-22 22:00:00,5865,"The walleye migration trend for years has been the warmer the weather/water the more the walleyes migrate east and of course the fishing gets much better here usually by July through Sept.......but not this year with this crap weather we continue to have.......... however, the perch fishing has been great........best advice is go with the flow and load up with some LARGE Lake Erie perch......"
