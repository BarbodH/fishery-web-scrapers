365181,Nanook,2009-07-22 22:38:00,565," Just got back from a vacation,and here is the list of woes The Fridge in the camper quit Lost the turn signals thro' the trailer harness Wifes car broke BOTH front coil springs Interac had been 'compromised'   Now for the accolades.  The fridge is under warranty,  :thumbsup_ Van 7 Truck world agreed to fix the harness  at NO COST, as they remembered a problrm awhile ago My mechanis rembered somthing about coil spring recalls. I went to Ford dealership, and ,yes, coilsprings on certain models have a 10yr extended recall warranty. Got her car fixed up NO CHARGE  [$500 would have been the cost which included the tow] Got the cards changed and no loss of funds  All the people I dealt with were top class and BOY......am I relieved.  I think I'll go get some lottery tickets"

365299,irishfield,2009-07-23 03:01:00,26272,What year Focus's does this recall cover??? Son is driving a 2005...
365308,Nanook,2009-07-23 03:16:00,565,"No ignition problems.....yet ryan. Is there a recall on that as well?  Wayne, Jackie's car is a 2003 Focus ZX5, as far as I know, the 'normal' warranty has been extended to 10 years because of known problems. Maybe he should have them checked out at the dealership.  RUST and material quality seems to be the problem."
