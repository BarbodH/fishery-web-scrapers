The sign that is up at the launch says $15 in/$15 out or so.  Don't know how well that is enforced.  I typically just pay for yearly use of the launch, so I wouldn't know.  There should be lots of parking, just drive around to the other side of the marina towards the big boat storage shed and park to the right of that (there should be other cars/trailers).  Free options in that area are Chapman's Landing in the Town of Nipissing (decent dirt launch) and a launch right in Callander (beware, VERY shallow!).  You may also be able to launch for free at Wade's Landing.  Great fishing along the South Shore there.  Good luck!"
