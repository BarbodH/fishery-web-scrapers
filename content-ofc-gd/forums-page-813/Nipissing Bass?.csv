Heres a map of the area  http://www.promisedlandcamp.net/fishingmap.html  . Just wondering where the bass will be hiding how deep and what has anyone has success on lure wise? Last year only caught one around some time jigging, no one was having success with bass. Why was teh bass fishing so slow last year?  Thanks ,LA"
