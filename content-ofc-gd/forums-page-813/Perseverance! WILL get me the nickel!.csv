364536,Fishing 24/7,2009-07-21 01:08:00,709,Today i was SOOOO close to a nickel....  I MUST GET HIM!!!!  I WILL GET HIM!!!     Stephanie brakes the ice with a Healthy 3.2 lbs Green trout.  There so clean.....      Cought on a chartreuse northam Buzzbait !8)  Then it slowed down..... DEADLY heat.... NO wind...  3-4 houres go by and its seems like only steph was getting them...  she got 3-4 of them.  nice 2-3 pounders.....  Stephanie gets a great idea.  why not explore this lake a litle more...  we find a bay that holds TRIANGLE HEADS!!!  HEAVEN!  I throw my BB Straight in the jungle of weeds.  The bait flows like the wind threw the triangle heads....Just like butter.  Then it happens.  A bass comes out to play.  a WAKE comes out of the weeds..... *BOOM*  Set the hook. Then the WEIGHT .  i feel it trust me.  my drag is set to the max i have 40 lbs Powerpro and a heavy rod...  Its pulling me right into the water.  GET THE NET! This time she gets him!  First thing i do i weight him....    the scale reads 4.11 lbs...... DOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH    The only thing i say is .  NOT A NICKEL!?!?!?!?!?  Here are the other pictures of the \\\'\\\'Not Nickel\\\'\\\'      Seems like everytime i got fishing they gain onces....  whats next a 4.15.............................................................  24/7

364571,Paully,2009-07-21 02:05:00,712,  I dont see a  crown but im real sure i see a horse shoe sticking out of his a........
364575,Whitespinnerbait,2009-07-21 02:08:00,2038,Bring WhitespinnerBait along with you tomorrow = Nickel  
364592,Cudz,2009-07-21 02:58:00,2652,Is that 4 pounds 11 ounces or 4.11 pounds.   There is a big difference.  4.11 pounds is actually 4 pounds 1.76 ounces.  I am assuming it is 4 pounds 11 ounces because you as what is next 4.15 which I think you mean is 4 pounds 15 ounces. Either way that is a nice fish indeed.  I would have guessed 5 pounds for sure.
364703,Fishing 24/7,2009-07-21 15:21:00,709, this week its me and my girl friend fishing all our favourite lakes.  i asked her if she wanted to HIPHOP camp but she rather sleep at home and go fishing every now and then!  next week is 6 days on a island with old buddies fishing the same lake OVER AND OVER AND OVER!  your right getting away in the wild will take my mind off of things.  i WILL get away!  and get ready for a 6 day report misfish!

365038,Fishing 24/7,2009-07-22 14:39:00,709,  sometimes i wish i could buy 30 of them and ship them to all the people who post's a 3 lbs bass and say.  im GUESSING its a 7 lbs bass.

365077,Fishing 24/7,2009-07-22 16:26:00,709,the actual size.??  do you think these fish are photoshoped?  im putting the fish right in your face so you can see it.  who needs the lenght . im giving you the weight.  mesuring the fish is just something else to do and more time out of the water. wich i dont want .  im known as the EXTENDED ARM FISHERMAN.  i cant let these people down.  When i look at my pictures i want to see the bass Not my ugly face!  ill give you the lenght of the 6 + ill catch you can be sure but the 4lbs + are going back in the water A.S.A.P!  these 4 lbs bass are what 18-20'' maybe? somewere around that!  i remmember catching a smallie that was 19.5 '' 4.8 lbs.....  mike the bass fisher.  ill think of you next time .... the bass will be so close to my bodie youl laugh you head off!
