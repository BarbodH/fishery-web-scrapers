I am heading to a cottage on Hassard Lake (The Magnetawan River) near Kearney this weekend, and can't find much information about the fishing. I assume they have bass, pike and pickerel, but if anyone has any experience with these bodies of water, advice would be much appreciated.  Thanks in advance!"

365521,shepdaug,2009-07-23 17:50:00,2, Thanks for the reply! Have you fished Hassard Lake in particular? Are there any spots in the area that seem to produce better than others?  Thanks again.
