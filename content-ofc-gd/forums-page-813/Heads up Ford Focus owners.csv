365316,Nanook,2009-07-23 03:24:00,565,Just a heads up about the front coil springs on the Focus. Just recently I found out that regular warranty [3yrs?] has been improved to 10yrs due to problems with rust and material quality. Check with your Dealer.  Nanook

365342,Sandbag,2009-07-23 05:45:00,533,A coil spring broke on my wifes Ford Taurus about one week after I received the recall notice.  It went when the car was parked in the driveway.  Tore right through the front tire sidewall when it let go (thank God it was parked at the time).  Ford replaced the springs under recall and the tire as well. No charge.  The intersting part is they showed me the spring that failed and it looked brand new.  No signs of rust/corrosion.  Must have been a material issue.  Cheers  Craig
