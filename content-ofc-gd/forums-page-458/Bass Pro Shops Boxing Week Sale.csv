I don't really need anything in the flyer but thought maybe some of you guys would like to know the deals!   Any thoughts on the BPS Enigma reel+free rod? Might be my chance to try baitcasting..."

650742,206,2011-12-24 17:01:00,563,"  Looks like a great deal, look at the reel on their site there are plenty of reviews....for 70bucks it might be a great place to start for a beginer if you can master it or enjoy then upgrade if not your not out much coin.  As well i notice they have a new model of this reel coming out so its a clearance item now."
