I think we fished maybe 15 hours at the most this year for skis but what a great few outings. With Mickey getting his 45 incher on our first outing to me getting a 45 and 50 fifteen minutes apart off the same spot we got that 45 the day before that was a night I will never forget just the size and beauty of those fish do something to you undescribable  45""   50""   Then I moved to bass fishing for most of the summer fishing tournaments and fishin my home water Sadly I couldn't catch bass like i was on my own time in the tournaments. That will change next year though heres my biggest bass from the season.... Still pissed about being alone and getting crappy pix            And heres the section over five this year... that i can still find pictures of  :x        And my big girl 6.2     I then ended my season with something i really havent done alot of... TROUT FISHIN heres a couple good ones           hope you guys enjoyed the pix just waiting for ice now"
