Instead of dreading, I decided to search out some open water to drop my canoe in. Arrived just before noon at the pike spot, and had about 3 hours worth of fishing done. Was really a bad trip at the beginning, as me and my buddy casted away for nearly 2 hours without even seeing a sign of fish. Just as we were about to call it quits, I say I'm going to switch up my spoon and make a couple more casts and I caught this guy on the very first cast of the bait change.    Was great today, as this might be my last softwater trip of 2011, and I caught a fish!"
