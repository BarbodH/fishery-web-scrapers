Not sure if the sale is at all TSC stores but I thought id let you all know...  Bonus... These ones are green instead of red... Great for hunters...    
650345,Zamboni,2011-12-22 17:08:00,235,I posted a classified ad here today for a Big Buddy Heater (18000btu) for $110....brand new in box. Big Buddy is $190 + tax at Princess Auto.  Please delete if this post plugging my ad is breaking any rules-I will only post once.

650353,mike rousseau,2011-12-22 17:19:00,4661, Big buddy was 99.99
650361,Zamboni,2011-12-22 17:43:00,235," Hmmm...checked and it still is $99 at Tractor Supply (US). Plus taxes of course but might 'hurt sales""...luckily I only have the one. Curious, same heater on same page is $130 at Tractor Supply if CARB compliant....Mr Heater makes 2 versions of these heaters. http://tsc.tractorsupply.com/search?w=Big+Buddy&searchButton.x=24&searchButton.y=10"
