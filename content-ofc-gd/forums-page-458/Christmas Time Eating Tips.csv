650455,Live2fish85,2011-12-22 22:35:00,1633,Thanks Skip. I know I will be fine as well. This will be my third heart surgery. I will be happy when I am good to get out on the ice if we get any and then snowboarding will be a bit later lol.
650456,Bob,2011-12-22 22:52:00,370,Mine will be home made because the store bought stuff makes my glucometer mad at me. It will be really light on sugar but definitely WILL have some rum in it.
650461,SirCranksalot,2011-12-22 23:11:00,3291,"Nothing new in that list---been doing that for years and have the arteries to prove it!  (""Seriously"",  LMAO, ROFL and a few more acronyms, then forwarded to a bunch of people)"
650465,kickingfrog,2011-12-22 23:44:00,8333,I have a strict see-food diet at this time of year. It's only been the last 3-4 years where it has caught up to me.
650502,Canuck2fan,2011-12-23 03:47:00,1444,There were some good egg nog recipes except for one thing in all them SUBSTITUTE half and half or heavy cream for all the milk. Do it in the spirit of the list LOL.  I remember making egg nog years for the hotel owner's christmas bash. 3 of the ingredients were... 2 liters of whipping cream 3 liters of half and half and a 40 of Planters Rum. 2 glasses of that nog and you weren't allowed to use the snowblower.
650505,dhickey,2011-12-23 04:03:00,1038,Personaly I eat and drink anything going this time of year knowing full well buy the middle of Febuary Ill have it burned off ICE FISHING. Eat up enjoy the festive season  Pls be  nice clear your ice..
650331,Billy Bob,2011-12-22 15:45:00,5865,"Christmas Time EATING TIPS  1.   Avoid carrot sticks. Anyone who puts carrots on a holiday buffet table knows nothing of the Christmas spirit.  In fact, if you see carrots, leave immediately.   Go next door, where they're serving rum balls.  2. Drink as much eggnog as you can. And quickly.   It's rare..  You cannot find it any other time of year but now. So drink up! Who cares that it has 10,000 calories in every sip? It's not as if you're going to turn into an eggnog-alcoholic or something. It's a treat. Enjoy it.  Have one for me. Have two.  It's later than you think. It's Christmas!  3.  If something comes with gravy, use it. That's the whole point of gravy.  Gravy does not stand alone. Pour it on. Make a volcano out of your mashed potatoes. Fill it with gravy. Eat the volcano. Repeat.  4. as for mashed potatoes, always ask if they're made with skim milk or whole milk. If it's skim, pass. Why bother? It's like buying a sports car with an automatic transmission.  5. Do not have a snack before going to a party in an effort to control your eating. The whole point of going to a Christmas party is to eat other people's food for free. Lots of it. Hello?  6. Under no circumstances should you exercise between now and New Year's.  You can do that in January when you have nothing else to do. This is the time for long naps, which you'll need after circling the buffet table while carrying a 10-pound plate of food and that vat of eggnog.  7. If you come across something really good at a buffet table, like frosted Christmas cookies in the shape and size of Santa, position yourself near them and don't budge. Have as many as you can before becoming the center of attention. They're like a beautiful pair of shoes. If you leave them behind, you're never going to see them again.  8. Same for pies. Apple,Pumpkin, Mincemeat. Have a slice of each. Or if you don't like mincemeat, have two apples and one pumpkin. Always have three.   When else do you get to have more than one dessert? LaborDay?  9. Did someone mention fruitcake? Granted, it's loaded with the mandatory celebratory calories, but avoid it at all cost. I mean, have some standards.  10. One final tip: If you don't feel terrible when you leave the party or get up from the table, you haven't been paying attention. Re-read tips; start over, but hurry, January is just around the corner. Remember this motto to live by:  ""Life should NOT be a  journey to the grave with the  intention of arriving  safely in  an attractive and well preserved body, but  rather to skid in   sideways, chocolate in one hand, body thoroughly  used up, totally worn  out and screaming ""WOO HOO what a ride!""  MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!  Bob"

650411,mike rousseau,2011-12-22 19:44:00,4661,"got this off the net...  this is basically the recipe i use...  Easy Eggnog Recipe Ingredients  6 eggs 3 cups milk 8 tablespoons sugar 3 teaspoon vanilla essence 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, ground Easy Eggnog Recipe Directions  In a large bowl, beat the eggs using an electric beater (if available). By turn, add milk & sugar. Continue beating until mixture thickens slightly. Add in the vanilla essence & ground nutmeg. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled (at least 3 hours).  Serves: 8.      or     Traditional Eggnog Ingredients  12 eggs, separated 6 cups milk 2 cups heavy/ thickened cream 2 cups bourbon 1+ 1/2 cups sugar 3/4 cup brandy 2 teaspoons ground nutmeg Traditional Eggnog Directions  In a large bowl and using a mixer, beat the egg yolks together with the sugar for approx 10 minutes (you want the mixture to be firm and the colour of butter). Very slowly, add in the bourbon and brandy - just a little at a time. When bourbon and brandy have been added, allow the mixture to cool in the fridge (for up to 6 hours, depending on how long before your party you're making the eggnog). 30 minutes before your guests arrive, stir the milk into the chilled yolk mixture. Stir in 1+ 1/2 teaspoons ground nutmeg. In a separate bowl, beat the cream with a mixer on high speed until the cream forms stiff peaks. In yet another bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the egg white mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Gently fold the cream into the egg mixture. After ladling into cups, garnish with the remainder of the ground nutmeg.  Serves: 8.              or            Alcoholic Eggnog Ingredients  6 eggs 2 extra egg yolks 4 cups whole milk 3/4 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup plus 2 Tablespoons of sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 Tablespoon vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg 1 cup bourbon Alcoholic Eggnog Directions  Start by whisking the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and salt in a large pan until well-blended. Keep on whisking while you slowly pour in the milk until it is completely mixed-in. Next, set the pan on your stove's burner and turn it to the lowest possible setting. Continuously whisk ingredients for 25-30 minutes or until the mixture reaches 160Â°F and will coat the underside of a spoon.  Next, remove the mixture from heat and strain it into a large-sized bowl, making sure to get out any pieces of cooked egg. Now stir in the bourbon, vanilla, and nutmeg, and transfer your mixture to a covered dish. Refrigerate the mix for at least 4 hours before proceeding.  Finally, when you're ready to serve your eggnog with alcohol, grab the heavy cream and whip it well. Now just fold in the chilled mix, pour, serve and enjoy!  Makes 14 servings."

650442,Big Cliff,2011-12-22 21:38:00,6899,That's the way I make mine but I leave out the first 8 ingredients and tripple the bourbon. Saves a lot of trips to the fridge especially if you serve it in a beer mug
