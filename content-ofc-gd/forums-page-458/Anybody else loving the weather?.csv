650319,Rod Caster,2011-12-22 14:40:00,5784,"To answer the original question... no, I want ice and snow. The weather is pleasant however. 0 deg, no wind... feels like spring."
650320,COUNTRYBOY,2011-12-22 14:41:00,130,CRAPPY BLOODY WEATHER..BRING ON THE WINTER..I'M PART POLAR BEAR
650321,manitoubass2,2011-12-22 14:41:00,11391,"I'm enjoying the weather, but.....  I do want to go ice fishing, and I'm very concerned about the water levels on rainy if this keeps up. We already have very low water levels...."
650322,fishindevil,2011-12-22 14:46:00,6254,for me i want to go snowmobiling bad !!! and if we dont get all the snow that we usually do its gonna mean really low water levels next year as most of ontario watersheds are 80% dependant on snowpac for their water supply it was interesting to read that as its something i thought only happened in the mountains but it does here too....
650325,mike rousseau,2011-12-22 14:55:00,4661,i guess im lucky...  water levels never change here because of the dams and the ships...  they have to maintain enough depth for the ships so the dams keep the water level pretty much the same all year....  if the water level changes a foot... thats a huge change here...    however the section of river upstream thats connected to lake O gets hit pretty hard with water fluctuation... 3-4 foot drop throughout the season... messes up the ice too sometimes... we get ice then the water drops a couple more feet and the shoreline breaks apart...
650330,manitoubass2,2011-12-22 15:34:00,11391," On Rainy river, we had one heck of a weird year. All ice season was good. But when the upstream rivers let go, we had darn near flood waters for the first time ever. Went from 7ft average to over 21ft average. Took all of spring and a bit of summer for the water to stabilize, and the fishing was just strange. I had to figure out new spots, new patterns etc, lots of fishing water with zero visibility, it was kinda a nightmare. Then towards the end of summer, everything dropped, down to a 2ft average, and went gin clear.  It's still around 3ft average now. If we don't get snow, I'm not gonna like next season very much (if there even is a season).   "
650347,BillM,2011-12-22 17:11:00,17367,"This weather is awesome!  Sinclair, you gotta start steelhead fishing"
650352,12footspringbok,2011-12-22 17:19:00,459,This weather is terrible.  Bring on the -20 and snowsqualls.
650366,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-12-22 17:51:00,535," Same here. I launched through the ice in November and decided to put the boat away then it warmed up again. I'm kicking myself now, especially since I got a new (to me) boat and only had it out a few times. Never even went out in the Bay this year."
650379,mike rousseau,2011-12-22 18:27:00,4661, Just think about the fish your gunna get next year with that boat... And the knowledge you've absorbed from this site and multiple guides...  Your gunna be a musky weapon...
650392,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-12-22 19:05:00,535,  Haha I don't know about that but I sure hope I can get a musky before September this time around lol. I'm not going to spend as much time fishing Baptiste and Elephant up north (fish there while visiting family) which seem to be pretty tough musky lakes and I'm going to focus more on the good musky waters closer to where I live.
650420,dhickey,2011-12-22 20:02:00,1038,"On the bright side...  For all the HARD WATER FISHERPERSONS?  We all know January is comming.Cold nites and short days. In my opinion these warm temps keep all the risk takers off bad ice.During the festive hollidays. When the cold temps hit it will lock up Simcoe almost overnite.  Ill take a warm CHRISTMASS and a cold start to a new year.  And 8"" of black ice any time :thumbsup_anim.  My prediction.  (Jan 12th)fishing Lady Simcoe  IMO.  Looking forward to cold hands and tight lines  Saltydawg.  Bring it on.."
650431,davew3,2011-12-22 20:50:00,430,"Right now for people traveling for the holidays this is great.  But after,  I hope it snows like a Bass.  Being on the BOQ the water in the late summer and fall is so low launching is a pain in the butt.  We need the water table to come back up.  Plus I want to see what my new 4x4 does in the snow.  Merry Christmas everyone"
650441,kickingfrog,2011-12-22 21:36:00,8333,If this was the type of weather I liked for winter I'd be living in Virginia.
650668,mikeseb,2011-12-24 02:58:00,201,"im with bill, who needs ice when youve got steel?"
650669,BillM,2011-12-24 03:05:00,17367,"I've got at least 5 days straight of steelheading next week, bring it on!!!!"
650673,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-24 03:25:00,10439,  And I have 10 days of ice fishing.
650675,blaque,2011-12-24 03:33:00,2419,"I had off yesterday and today lickin my chops but the water just wouldn't come down for me!!! Ah well...next 2 days of family and food, and off all next week. Hope Santa brings green water"
650222,mike rousseau,2011-12-22 01:26:00,4661,Looks like I'll be in my boat well into january...  2 week forecast has mild weather...  I'm loving this..  Anybody else still putting the boots to the fish on the open water...?  Might get in another trip to quinte at this rate...
650223,kuhaman,2011-12-22 01:31:00,503,Put the boat away a month ago and got the ice fishin gear together
650224,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-22 01:34:00,10439,Put the boat away in mid October and have been hitting the ice since then.
650226,solopaddler,2011-12-22 01:39:00,8605,"Steelheading hasn't slowed down in the slightest.  Had a fantastic day today up north.  So yeah, I'm loving the weather."
650227,kuhaman,2011-12-22 01:39:00,503,I hate you LOL How many hours of daylight do you have?
650228,mike rousseau,2011-12-22 01:41:00,4661, I was gearing this one to the folks of Ontario...lol  BTW... Where ate the reports?     That's the exact reason why I don't winterize my boat...  Doesn't make much sense when we only get ice for 3 months...at the most...
650229,Rizzo,2011-12-22 01:44:00,4754,"winterized it for the second time this past Saturday. Thank goodness musky is closed or it would be MIGHTY tempting to haul the tarps back off, get it off the blocks etc etc yet another time"
650233,kuhaman,2011-12-22 01:48:00,503,Usually by this time of year I can't even get my boat out of the driveway. Stays that way til March.
650234,crappieperchhunter,2011-12-22 01:48:00,2582,In a word...NO. I really love the ice...so this prolonged unseasonal weather is very frustrating  Glad all you others are enjoying extended seasons on the fishing you enjoy...but man I just want to get on some solid ice.
650235,mike rousseau,2011-12-22 01:49:00,4661," So why not ""winterize"" the boat once the ice forms?"
650237,Rizzo,2011-12-22 01:52:00,4754, ...solid being the key. Sometimes when the ice takes longer to form than normal people get a bit antsy and head out when they shouldn't
650238,kuhaman,2011-12-22 01:52:00,503,By the time we get ice in southern Ontario I'm already up to my waist in snow here on the shores of lake Huron. Rather take care of the winterizing before that.
650242,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-22 02:16:00,10439," 4 hours & 57 minutes, but starting tomorrow we gain 6 minutes a day!!!"
650243,kickingfrog,2011-12-22 02:31:00,8333,"  Nice, down here it's more like 3 or so."
650251,jjcanoe,2011-12-22 03:12:00,744,lots of solid ice in the Canadian Tire parking lot in Arnprior..... nearly fell on my butt when I got out of the truck!  5 more deliveries between here and Quebec City tomorrow and the radar is showing freezing rain all the way up there :-(  wonder if the manager would let me try out a nice gas auger in the lot while he unloads me?
650253,OutdoorDan,2011-12-22 03:17:00,325,"I winterized my boat second week of November when the first cold hit.  So no, I am not enjoying this weather because not only am I kicking myself for that, it looks like I won't be able to hit the ice for a while.  Yes I'm jealous."
650270,BillM,2011-12-22 04:15:00,17367,"Steel, steel and more steel.  Icefishing can wait!"
650277,highdrifter,2011-12-22 05:23:00,2534, Yah but some fresh pow on the slopes would be a groove..  This winter's gonna be pretty bleak if we don't get snow.  Thought environment canada was predicting a cold winter!!  What the frigue..
650287,pikehunter,2011-12-22 10:22:00,1659,"Nope, don't mind it at all! However I can feel for those that depend on ice and snow for income and I do have concerns for the environment if it continues too long."
650290,lew,2011-12-22 10:49:00,12766,"My boats up on blocks, but I'm still loving this weather !!  Only 3 months till spring, bring it on"
650291,Billy Bob,2011-12-22 10:49:00,5865,Today's the first day of WINTER.....anyone going ice fishing on Lake Erie....  If I never see ice and snow again it would be too soon....  (I know I'm going to pay for this later this winter)
650297,Fisherman,2011-12-22 12:21:00,7201,It's a whole lot cheaper heating the house and no snow to push or blow.
650302,OhioFisherman,2011-12-22 12:46:00,6623,"We have been increasing our yearly rainfall record, it seems almost daily, for almost two months, but better that than snow."
650307,HTHM,2011-12-22 13:12:00,4082,"If this keeps up, we may have to be concerned about our fruit crops for next year."
650312,mike rousseau,2011-12-22 13:36:00,4661,Last couple years I've got my boat in the water mid march...  If that's the case this year I might only get about 2 months of fishable ice...  And I'm ok with that...
