Works okay, but, I figure the proper ice transducer will be alot less fuss. Anybody have one kicking around they want to part with for a reasonable cost?  I can get a new one from Jocelyn, but, if anyone has any other suggestions I'd be happy to hear them. Feel free to PM.  Cheers, Frank"

650034,asdve23rveavwa,2011-12-21 03:30:00,2690," Yeah, I've already talked to him about it, Ron.  Just looking for a slightly cheaper alternative.  Never hurts to ask, someone might have one kicking around that they aren't using."
650035,irishfield,2011-12-21 03:35:00,26272,Grab one if he has it now Frank... they get as rare as hen's teeth when you really need one !
