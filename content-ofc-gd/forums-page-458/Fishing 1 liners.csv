650354,Garry2Rs,2011-12-22 17:21:00,1425,"Fishing related... Fishermen never really grow up...But, the good one's learn how to act in public.  I told the guy at the tackle shop I wanted a spinning rod for my wife...He said ""We don't do trades!""  I asked my girlfriend if she had given the minnows fresh water...She said ""No!""  ""They haven't finished what you gave them yesterday""  What do you call a Musky with a gun? ... Sir  What do you call a deaf fisherman? ... Anything you like, he won't hear you!  What do you call a fish with no eye?...FSH!!!!  I don't believe in Catch and Release...I didn't fight my way to the top of the food chain to be a vegetarian!  A Newbie asked, ""How much does it cost to get a really good fishing outfit?"" I replied, ""I don't know yet, I'm still buying tackle.""  Work Related... I thought I wanted a career, turns out I just wanted paychecks.  A bus station is where a bus stops. A train station is where a train stops. On my desk, I have a work station...  Life related... If God is watching us, the least we can do is be entertaining.  God must love stupid people. He made SO many.  The voices in my head may not be real, but they have some good ideas! Garry2R's"

Today my regional director approached me and asked what I was passionate about, and I of course explained ""fishing"".  I went on and on for about 20 minutes, then he asked me to relate fishing to business and if I combine the two, would I be as passionate about my job as I am my hobby.  He also asked my to come up with one liners that relate fishing to business.  Is there anyone out there that may have a few I could borrow? Thanks for your help"
