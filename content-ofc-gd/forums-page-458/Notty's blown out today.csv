650603,esoxansteel,2011-12-23 21:17:00,1307,"  I think you and Jasper should move after that comment, that was definately below the belt, and deserves a 5 minute timeout"
650605,rhare,2011-12-23 21:31:00,387,    Do you know something no one else does?
650610,12footspringbok,2011-12-23 22:11:00,459," I can only hope your kidding. I'm on the notty probably 30-40 different days a year. Never once been checked there. The only time I ever see CO's is on simcoe in the winter or up north in the spring.    I like to keep the odd fish in the fall, and I know lots of other people that do as well. So I'm not a big fan of making more of the Notty C&R. I'd like the idea of maybe a slot size a bit better. Maybe protect the prime spawners say 24-32 inches. I don't think its fair that the honest guy keeps getting more restrictions imposed. The poachers are going to keep taking fish either way, and I don't see the commercials on the bay releasing incidental by-catches either. I hate to even get on that topic here on OFC but that a big problem as well."
650611,BillM,2011-12-23 22:11:00,17367, Not very good spawning water   Even the nooks don't stop there!  lol
650625,davey buoy,2011-12-23 23:12:00,5505,"I've had some strange looks as well Bill,also been confronted as to why would I be fishing and not keeping the fish. That was at two different times. Some people get really aggressive . You can tell they are not from the area."
650651,Rustic-Fisher,2011-12-24 01:15:00,826," LOL yes, i have kept him in the dark on that one. As far a the tag idea goes, I understand the funding issue, but I would sure rather pay for a few tags per year  instead of an  ""Essa  township fishing pass"".  (And FYI I don't entirely agree with the parking tickets and the IBP parking fees for ice fishing.) Before ""Fisherman"" jumps on me  LOL..."
650657,Fisherman,2011-12-24 01:48:00,7201,"Ha, no sweat, I live here and absolutely hate the Essa pass. I don't even fish there anymore. I can see maybe paying a few dollars for parking at IBP, the daily amount they make there on weekends can easily offset the cost for snow removal and a bit of garbage disposal. $10 a day is a bit much if you get lucky and have a 2 day fishing weekend.  Even worse they only make you pay early in the morning, it seems the late crowd gets in free."
650660,BillM,2011-12-24 02:16:00,17367,Parking for icefishing just irks me the wrong way.
650661,Rustic-Fisher,2011-12-24 02:16:00,826," LOL, lets save the IBP parking pass issue for when we are all pulling whities from atop 12' of good ice. Till then, Good fishing! R"
650349,Familyfisherman,2011-12-22 17:12:00,188,"Tried the Notty near Baxter this morning (Thurs)...up about a foot, VERY dirty...give it a couple days...only a couple fish, although a Beaver did swim by within a few feet which was interesting..."
650372,Rustic-Fisher,2011-12-22 18:03:00,826,Not far from there you may see a couple river otters engaged in their river antics.  Not great for fishing but hilarious to watch. Thanks for the update. R
650399,BillM,2011-12-22 19:30:00,17367,"Let's hope the winter weather gets her so everyone will start ice fishing.  More reports on Simcoe, less on the rivers."
650433,rhare,2011-12-22 20:57:00,387,at least a good portion is C&R not like a few other slaughter houses around...
650439,misfish,2011-12-22 21:32:00,29133,"  One of the reasons I love fishing the stretch from Angus to Alliston. C&R. FUN FUN FUN. If I want a feed of trout,I head to a local place for my needs.   Ah Bill,  hear ya."
650462,BillM,2011-12-22 23:31:00,17367, Best thing that's ever happened to that river.  Wouldn't mind seeing a few more Gbay tribs follow suit.
650470,rhare,2011-12-23 00:02:00,387,"  100% agree, the amount of guys fishing this fall everyday is crazy. I also can't believe how many guys are there day after day taking home fish. Hope some changes are made soon the CO's are all for it and see the damage thats being done."
650472,Kingsalmon,2011-12-23 00:21:00,107,Even in NY they lower their limit to one steelhead in tributaries (LO tribs).  If the MNR would lower the limit a lot of people wouldn't bother driving two/three hours for one fish.
650477,Rustic-Fisher,2011-12-23 00:46:00,826,"Would  love to see a Tag system implemented on the Notty. Wonder how many fish at any given time are in some of the ""Angus crews"" freezers Lol."
650480,BillM,2011-12-23 01:31:00,17367,If they make it past 'the kill zone' they're lucky!  lol
650523,12footspringbok,2011-12-23 11:59:00,459, Way to generalize.... Its always the meat hunting locals fault...  Who exactly is going to enforce a tag system?  The Co's that are already spread so thin they can't even properly enforce the C&R section or the 2 fish possesion limit?  In all the hours I've spent on that river over the past 13-14 years the closest I have come to seeing a CO is the card that was left on my windshield 2 years ago.     You'd be surprised Bill. I seen alot of prime spawning hens released by the most unlikely candidates this fall in the lower sections. I think catch and release really is starting to catch on for some anyways....
650527,Rustic-Fisher,2011-12-23 13:01:00,826,"""Angus crew"" are not all from Angus but fish it daily @ hwy 90. Check out how Florida manages their Tarpon tags. Not saying go that extreme but it's an idea. No COs in 13-14years... Better get out a bit more lol. Thou I agree that it's a well known problem that They are spread sparingly to start."
650528,BillM,2011-12-23 13:25:00,17367," Education is way cheaper then a tag system   I never fish the lower stretches, so I'm only going by the handful of times I've ever fished right in Angus.  I've gotten some strange looks after releasing fish"
650540,ch312,2011-12-23 14:52:00,1590," while i understand where you're coming from, i see no harm in posting reports on water conditions, daily catches, or what presentations worked that day. a general report like this causes no harm.  IMO, your post is worse than the OP as it states a specific place to fish. you're clearly against people posting reports on rivers, but yet you tell everyone there's fish to be caught in angus. just sayin...  "
650547,BillM,2011-12-23 15:58:00,17367," You see no harm in up to date water conditions, fish caught and what presentations worked?  I guess you like people doing the leg work for you  BTW, mentioning Angus is like mentioning Erindale park on the Credit (OMG did I just ruin that fishery to?!??!?!)"
650554,newb09,2011-12-23 16:42:00,49, I thought notty is is no kill zone.
650559,BillM,2011-12-23 17:01:00,17367, Only from the confluence of the Boyne/Notty to the confluence of the Pine/Notty.
650570,Fisherman,2011-12-23 17:21:00,7201,"Ya, wonder how many many whities are in the freezers from the lowlanders around Innisfil and their retarded parking rules and outrageous parking rates."
650574,Rustic-Fisher,2011-12-23 18:21:00,826,"Likely a bunch, not in my freezer though. And good for you were able to read I live in Innisfil and than call me ""a lowlander"" lol Merry Christmas Bud LOL....."
650578,rhare,2011-12-23 19:03:00,387,"  Yeah it's easy to change the subject and point fingers at other fisheries. Fact of the matter is that it's the same ""type"" of angler that abuse a fishery. Angus,Innisfil,Jackson Point,Gbay shore lines, the list goes on. Every night for  weeks I saw the same guy cleaning fish at the fish cleaning station on hwy 90. Its pretty hard to argue that there's a serious problem there.   As far as a tag system lets be realist.If we don't have the cash to enforce the current laws then how are we going to monitor a tagging system? It would more benefical to make some other tribs C&R as well and maybe extend the C&R zone on the notty"
650579,newb09,2011-12-23 19:08:00,49, Good to know.. Thanks Bill
650588,Fisherman,2011-12-23 20:09:00,7201,"Well if you see the same guy cleaning fish every night, there's the option of calling the MNR.  I would rather see the present C&R zone become a no fish zone outright.  At least then there's a good area for the fish to grow, spawn and not be bothered."
650591,rhare,2011-12-23 20:26:00,387,  I've made more then my fair share of phone calls on both the tribs and in the winter on Simcoe.  Making the present C&R zone a out right no fish zone isn't going to accomplish anything. The fish aren't spawning in those areas and they aren't spending much of there early life there either. How many parr have you caught in the Notty? The headwaters and the tribs that flow into notty are the main spawning areas and most are fairly well protected as it is.
650592,BillM,2011-12-23 20:29:00,17367, They don't spawn in the C&R zone....  Making it a no fish zone would be pointless.
650598,misfish,2011-12-23 21:01:00,29133,  EH?
