650169,jedimaster,2011-12-21 19:35:00,3472,Hey does anyone happen to have the hockey game taped from May 17th 1999? I was on tv during the opening with Ron Mclean... been looking for a copy for a while as I lost my copy.
650183,I'mHooked,2011-12-21 21:31:00,525,Why don't you just check with Mclean? He's probably got his own keepsake copy!
650186,jedimaster,2011-12-21 21:52:00,3472,"yah, I asked him but he just got a brand new bottle of pepper spray, so I figured it was best to keep my distance. lol"

650240,Rizzo,2011-12-22 02:02:00,4754,"the Leafs don't play hockey in May, you must mean a different month"
650245,vance,2011-12-22 02:48:00,719,Asked the down load expert-my son- and he looked and tried BUT it is not out there and even if it was more than likely you wouldn't get the non game extras.The CBC would have the footage you just have to ask NICELY for it.  vance
