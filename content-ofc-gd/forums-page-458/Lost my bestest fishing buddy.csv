I have always said when I retire one of the first things I wanna get is a ""fishing dog"" to join me whenever I head out to fish. Peanut was the perfect fishing partner and full of happy excited energy that couldn't help but put a smile on your face.  My thoughts are with you Bruce, you have lost a good pet and a great friend.  Take care of yourself my friend and remember the many good times you 2 shared together."

Only a dog; anyone that would think that has never known or felt the unconditional love that they bring into our lives, they have no idea what they are missing.  Bruce I know how much Peanut ment to you as our beloved Andy did to us. They are not a dog, they are part of our family and our lives. Some will never understand but those of us who have loved and been loved by them do!  Keep strong my friend, There is a hole in your heart for a reason, it is the very best place to bury someone so special!"

I'm not sure what the fate of that shepherd would have been if it was me on the end of peanuts leash. I don't trust shepherds. The only dog I never trust. I'd rather be greeted by a pitbull any day.  Crazy story. I really feel bad for you.  S."

Peanut did a great job training you ....share that with your next family member  Condolences"
649513,bigugli,2011-12-19 15:35:00,6138,"  First, let me thank all of you for your kind words and wishes.  Despite  the attack and the wounds. Peanut was still quite spunky and lively. Some of the injuries were healing. Sadly the wounds to her skin would not heal and the skin kept deteriorating. It was only a matter of hours before it would begin to rot. I could not let her suffer. Now she is at peace in a far better place. Many think, ""big deal, it's only a dog!"" Well she was not just a dog. She was an individual, a real personality who loved unconditionally and was loved. I've never known a dog to actually hug and not let go, or give a contented moan when you hugged it back. But she was more than that. The past few years have been less than kind, as some already know. My wife and daughter would both be in hospital for weeks on end. I had to throw my son out because of the trouble he kept bringing home. During those lonely, frustrating days and nights, my only friends to turn to were my dogs. When I was ill Peanut stood watch over me. Every night Peanut always crawled under the covers to snuggle beside me. Peanut, especially was my ray of sunshine. Always happy and excited to see me as I walked in the door. Always ready to go the moment you mentioned ""car"", ""walk"", or ""fishing""   She was my shadow wherever I went. Only exception was when fishing buddies like Dave or Bill came by, then I was chopped liver. But forever a happy dog. Even in these last days. I truly feel as though I have lost a little child.  I will surely miss her.."

Ever since your thread about Peanut being attacked, I keep a real eye open for bigger dogs out there when I walk Ralphie.  Something I never thought about before.  Remember the good times and know that he loved you very much.  Sounds like he was there for you no matter what and you two had a unique, loving relationship that was mutually beneficial.  Peanut sounds like he was a great companion so hold that in your heart forever.  Joey"

I fully understand your anguish unfortunately... I have had to put down a pet once and have never since forgotten that day. I don't regret the decision as it put an end to his suffering but it was by far the single hardest thing I have ever had to do. A ""planned"" loss that gives you time to say good bye does not by any means make it easier....if anything I believe to be harder.  Having to make that decision...this time of year... when the situation is a result of someone's negligence..that is as tough a spot as they come. You have My deepest sympathies,"

649575,solopaddler,2011-12-19 20:06:00,8605,What an unexpected blow. Even harder when you're forced to take action yourself out of love. That takes an enormous amount of courage.  I've been through it myself once and know how it feels. You and your family have my deepest sympathies.
649576,woodenboater,2011-12-19 20:07:00,2277,"Wow, this is not something I was hoping to read here for a long time to come. My sincerest condolences Bruce and I hope you keep the happy memories Peanut shared with you, deep in your heart where it will give you strength and peace of mind. As others said, this is something only dog/pet owners can really appreciate and I hope the words you read here help you in your time of loss."
