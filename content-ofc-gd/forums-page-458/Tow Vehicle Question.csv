I may have the option of mooring the boat as well.  I live in Grimsby, and my family has a trailer in Lowbanks...I may be able to leave the boat at the trailer."

650129,dave524,2011-12-21 16:30:00,4508,"2012 will be my 30th anniversary of towing a rig identical to what you are anticipating. 18 1/2 Sylvan aluminum, V4 OMC, built in gas tank , 9.9 kicker, riggers and other gear for a 2500 lb total. Started towing it with a 79 GMC 3/4 ton van and a 4 bbl. obviously no problem  next were a pair of 4.3 L GM vortecs, a 88 Chevy full size pickup and a 97 GM Safari, both did admirally  . Now I've just retired and down sized to a Jeep Liberty 3.7L. The Jeep is fine at this weight, it is rear wheel drive with a solid rear axle and the 2 speed tranfer case makes a slippery ramp a breeze, rated to tow 5000 lbs. That being said, I live a couple of hundred yards from my usual launch ramp here in Grimsby and only several times a years will go to Lake Erie at Port Colborne or Port Maitland and that is all regional roads at 80kph/50mph. What I will not do with this combo is go on 400 series highways at 120+ kph, personnally I don't like the idea of a short wheel base on a tow vehicle at high speeds, just saying  edit: Oh that $30 thousand rig was less than $10,000 including taxes in 82"
650131,Billy Bob,2011-12-21 16:38:00,5865," I really can't see the problem ""IF"" the tow vehicle and or trailer has sufficient braking power....I towed a 3k pop up trailer with a Ford Escape  without a problem on a trip out west that include Ontario, 17 states and crossed the continental divide twice that endured 6,500 miles in 30 days, 100% trouble free....think tractor trailer for one moment."
650134,bigugli,2011-12-21 16:50:00,6138,"I used Ford minivans with 3500lb tow capacity for towing, but they are not in production any more. That being said, having a family of 5 and all the attending baggage that goes with a family that size, a crew cab might do, but I'd be leaning toward a passenger van."
650137,dave524,2011-12-21 17:06:00,4508," Not really worried about the braking but sway with the short wheel base, everything I've read seems to say that when you could get a bad case of tail wagging the dog ."
650138,Billy Bob,2011-12-21 17:12:00,5865," That's why I said think ""tractor trailer""....it doesn't happen to them and it didn't happen to me in over 6000 miles of high speed highway travelling."
650140,irishfield,2011-12-21 17:24:00,26272," I hope that's WHEN towing the trailer Mike!  My 5.0 x F150 XLT dash screen Average fuel consumption is currently showing 13.4 l/100km, after some hard runs around town for supplies this morning. That's 17.55 MPG for Billy Bob and 21.1 MPG for us North of the ""gallon shy"" line. When towing a draggy/heavy 22' enclosed trailer I average under 20 litre/100km... usually about 18.2 or so... but at 20litre/100 that equals 14.1 miles per imperial gallon."
650143,bigbuck,2011-12-21 17:45:00,2449,"If you plan on doing ANY significant amount of towing, get a proper vehicle to do it with. This question always pops up in the silly season. A minivan can do the job BUT it takes a beating and you can forget about a panic stop. That's an overlooked issue. My minivan can tow 3500lbs. My boat gear and trailer come in around 3300 lbs. I can cruise at a hundred kph but stopping is another issue. That's why the only time I pull my boat is either really early in the morning or really late at night. A real tow vehicle won't be great on gas but will be useful. Besides, a fwd minivan sucks on unimproved or gravel boatlaunches. Good luck selling it to the wife. I presented the boat as a fait accompli. I went and bought it right after we bought our travel trailer and said 'Surprise'!!!"
650150,mike rousseau,2011-12-21 18:15:00,4661, Every day driving...  Tow my boat 3 times a week... Some highway... Some in town...  I've crunched the numbers based on how many km I get per fill up...  I usually end up around 16L/100km  But my fx4 has a 5.4 and is the heaviest f150 line up due to the skid plates...  My truck weighs 2700kg
650154,Raf,2011-12-21 18:29:00,3495,My '01 grand cherokee 4.7 v8 is my tow vehicle  I get about 20-21mpg (10-11 L/100km) on the hwy when keeping it under 110km/hr and 15mpg (14-15 L/100km) in the city (not towing)  my boat/trailer weighs under 1000lbs but the jeep will pull 3000lbs easy.
650157,lew,2011-12-21 18:40:00,12766,"If you want to tow a heavy boat, get yourself a strong truck.  If you get yourself a strong truck, don't expect real good gas mileage.  If your worried about poor gas mileage, get yourself a small boat that can be towed with a small truck.  You can't have everything boys.  I bought myself a boat that's around 3500 pounds, so I also bought myself an F-150 supercrew with a 5.4 motor to tow it with. It's a stong truck and does a great job of towing the boat, it also stops very well and has plenty of room for carrying my gear.  It's OK on fuel consumption but not good, but I knew that when I bought it and as such, I don't worry about it.  It is what it is."

650165,michigander fisherman,2011-12-21 18:59:00,64,if you havent bought your boat yet. look at alumacraft. my grandpa bought a 165 ft classic. great fishing boat couldnt ask for more. it could easily be towed behind minivan or small vehicle. they make nice 18 ft boats too. he got his from cabelas in michigan
650171,bigbuck,2011-12-21 19:36:00,2449,"An 18ftr rigged with trailer is probably north of 2500lbs. That means a real tow vehicle. So, what Lew said!"
650174,Roy,2011-12-21 19:40:00,13728, Got a picture of the minivan?
650176,misfish,2011-12-21 19:53:00,29133,"Cars/vans and trucks have changed lots. If you need comfort for the family driver to pull that boat,look at the ford edge. The guy that bought my 18ft bayliner cudie, drove away with it driving an edge. He pulled the boat out of the steep ramp with ease and no sag was to be seen. I was dumb founded.   Just saying."
650181,OutdoorDan,2011-12-21 20:56:00,325,If the Edge was an AWD 3.7L then it would be much more suitable for towing than a van though.

We get about very close to 20MPG on the highway with it and somewhere around 15 in the city. Not bad for a 5.3L V8 with 310HP in a heavy truck like this.
650198,ecmilley,2011-12-21 23:25:00,2163,"one option is going used if you can afford an extra vehicle, seen lots of mid 90's grand cherokees selling in the $1000-$2000 in decent shape, yes there tough on fuel but they can pull just about any kind of fishing boat under 20 feet, run into stuff go into some nice back lakes a jeep will get you there parts are pretty cheap and widely available and with all the help on OFC you can keep it running good for a long time and if it blows up oh well no big loss if using it as a weekend vehicle"

649991,Bigfisherman,2011-12-21 01:37:00,100,"Before buying a new $30k boat I would buy a smaller boat and learn the ropes. Then buy the bigger boat. As for a tow vehicle any used Jeep for $15-20k would tow 3500#s no problem(not the 4cylinder ones tho I'm talking Liberty, Cherokee, or a Commander). No need to spend $40k just so you can tow something."
650000,OutdoorDan,2011-12-21 01:51:00,325,"Pete,  I was in exactly the same shoes as you this spring.  I knew exactly what I wanted in a boat - big and capable of handling the Great Lakes, but the family vehicle was a Dodge Grand caravan, not capable of towing a boat that size.  I ended up getting a 20 foot Fishmaster and just had it docked at one Marina for the year.  If you are just starting out this isn't a bad option as at least you are always forced to be in the same place and can learn the area.  There is also the convenience of not hauling a boat up the 400, launching it, etc.  You just bring your fishing gear, jump in and off you go.  If you get bored of the same Marina you can have it docked somewhere else next year.  That way you can put off getting a car to tow it with until you are ready.  I would not settle for a smaller boat if you know you want a bigger one.  If you get a small boat now and want to replace it in a couple of years, you will have the headache of selling it and again need to search for a new one, which can take a while depending on how picky you are.  Also you are overestimating how much a car capable of towing the boat would cost.  Cars depreciate pretty quickly and you can get a used truck down the road to tow it with for well under 20k.  I think the comfort of the boat and having it suit your exact needs is much more important than having a car that does the same.  You are using the boar for pleasure, whereas the car is more of a tool for transportation (although I'm sure some car lovers would disagree).  I would gladly put up with a slightly less than comfortable ride if I knew it meant spending the day in the perfect boat.  On the other hand I wouldn't want a situation where I get a sweet ride to the boat but then I have to spend the day trying to enjoy myself in a boat I settled for."
650022,sneak_e_pete,2011-12-21 02:38:00,540,"Thanks for the replies.  I appreciate the insight.  I do have a nice little boat now (16 ft aluminum with 40hp), but I also have a 4 year old, 2 year old and 2 month old boys that I will want a bigger boat for in a few years.  I want a very comfortable set-up for us to hang out in.  Thanks again."
650024,barrystrs,2011-12-21 02:49:00,75,"Most minivans are rated to tow 3500 lbs are you sure you need a new tow vehicle.  My neighbour tows a 19' nitro fish and ski and a 150 with his mini van.  I'm not sure I agree with this, but it depends how often and how far you tow."
650026,OutdoorDan,2011-12-21 02:53:00,325,Getting the boat out of the water with front wheel drive is going to be the bigger issue than highway towing.
650061,Billy Bob,2011-12-21 11:05:00,5865,I agree a 16' boat will be too small for a family of five so your stuck between a rock and a hard place.  Lota lota's advice is probably the best but I would look into a boat slip on a inland lake with those little guys....forget the Great Lakes for now and enjoy the precious moments you have with them little guys in a 18' boat or larger on some small lake...then down the line you may afford a larger SUV/Truck to move that boat to the Great Lake or wherever the fish may be biting.  Bob
650062,skeeter,2011-12-21 11:21:00,1907," Most mini vans are 2200LBS and less depending on the type and options. They are built on car frames. The only one's that were built on truck frames were the gm astro & safari's and the ford aerostar with a 5000LB rate, they stopped making those a few years ago."
650064,scugpg,2011-12-21 11:56:00,1373,Escape V6 4x4 might fit the bill and most say its not too bad on gas. It can tow 3500lbs.  2009's and later have the 6 speed so that will give you better mileage. Lots of them out there at reasonable prices.  It may be too cozy for a family of 5 though.
