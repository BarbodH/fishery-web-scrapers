649952,motion,2011-12-20 23:27:00,403," Hey Terry, any idea where we can get them here in Canada? How about yours Dave, are they avaiable in Canada. I like the idea that you can leave either style out when reversing. Either style may work well on my air cooled Polaris.  Thanks."
649958,Terry,2011-12-20 23:45:00,14456,I had to order mine on-line from the US
649976,skeeter,2011-12-21 00:58:00,1907,"Yes you can get them here . 16610 bayview ave, newmarket.

649978,skeeter,2011-12-21 01:00:00,1907,"Terry, in the add it shows it attached to the rail. You say it can go on the ski also ?"
650004,Terry,2011-12-21 02:00:00,14456,"yeah the rail is more effective  I have them as an extra, so if I am going for a very long trip on ice with no snow, I like having as much powder as possible going into my sliders and heat exchanger so I use both types at the same time and can add the bolts to the ski too  you can never be too prepared"
650050,carll2,2011-12-21 04:30:00,443,"i use to use slidekicks for my 154 inch track with 2.5 inch paddles and after 1 season i find the wire isnt as effective and have as much ""down pressure"" ive gone back to normal ice scratchers"
650063,skeeter,2011-12-21 11:40:00,1907," Mental note, ""never try to follow Terry across the lake"" Then again IF I could see threw all the ice and snow flying out from your sled I wouldn't need scratchers.  I like your way of thinking Terry, now I'm making plans for my sled."
650145,motion,2011-12-21 17:49:00,403,Thanks Dan!
650267,barrystrs,2011-12-22 03:58:00,75,"Don't forget that sliders melt at a specific temperature.  Slow down if you feel them dragging or can smell them, this makes a huge difference."
650357,richyb,2011-12-22 17:37:00,774,how are you guys using bolts on your skis? will they rip out on roads?
650359,Sinker,2011-12-22 17:40:00,8692,I've shoveled snow from a snow bank into the tunnel and it will get you where you gotta go in a pinch. Also the slush from your holes will help if your in a pinch!   S.
650363,Terry,2011-12-22 17:44:00,14456," you put a 4"" bolt and only put the nut just on the boat  that gives it lots of play self adjusting as it was..  but I only put them on when I need them and hit the ice and I always remove them before I leave the ice  I forgot to remove them a couple of times and there was no damage from the road"
650490,skeeter,2011-12-23 02:29:00,1907,"Terry, any chance you can re-post the pictures of your skis?"
649717,Sharkbait22,2011-12-20 02:33:00,297,"How do people manage sledding on crusty snow and ice without burning off the slides? Last year on Simcoe, there were a few times we had rain and then freeze-up.  I installed scratchers this year and new graphite-loaded slides.  These scratchers fit on the skid. It's a 1997 380 Skandic.  I've read about people using bolts through the skis.  I think Terry might have tried this. Any pointers appreciated.  PS someone wake Mother Nature up already. Make some ice!"
649718,irishfield,2011-12-20 02:38:00,26272,Terry has scratchers.. I have bolts thru my skis for the days they're needed. Both seem to do the trick. Mine's air cooled so I'm only worried about the track/sliders. Terry's is liquid cooled and I think he also added something to mist the cooler...or that may have been Fishhunter/Lloyd.
649720,Terry,2011-12-20 02:42:00,14456,"I have bolts through the ends of the skis, they work not too bad but scratchers work best    <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvid25.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fc52%2FMrbeee1954%2FVideos%2FDIGI0007.mp4"">"
649725,skeeter,2011-12-20 03:03:00,1907,You need to make that video longer Terry. Now I've got the itch and need to scratch it.  Those are the store bought kind are they? Where did you buy them? Royal dist.?
649731,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-20 03:21:00,10439,I have a pair of Tric Ice Scratchers and they are light years ahead of any of the hard spring steel scratchers out there. They ain't cheap but the first time you accidentally back up with the regular scratchers deployed and trash them you will wish you payed the few extra $$$ for them.  I have had the spring steel scratchers and they do work quite well but they become pretzels if you back up with them deployed and need to be replaced while these are made of heavy stainless cable with a replaceable stud as the point that does the scratching.  
649732,irishfield,2011-12-20 03:24:00,26272,Do they really get enough force going to make a good spray Dave?? I have lots of stuff around here to make something similar....
649733,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-20 03:29:00,10439, Yeah they work very well.  I'll try and get some video on the weekend if I remember. I'm old and don't remember things too good any more.  They are carving up the deck on my sled trailer pretty good if that gives you any idea.
649736,irishfield,2011-12-20 03:34:00,26272,"Okay.. I have lots of cable ""cut offs"" with no other use for them.. swagging tools and some cable ends around here that I can fabricate a point or installed a sharpened bolt into.... so I think I can make something similar with no real expense but my time."
649742,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-20 03:40:00,10439,  There you go. Once you get em figured out ya can send me a couple of sets for Arctic testing.  As I said the set I have are drilled and tapped for a carbide track stud. They hold up well and are cheap and easy to replace.
649774,Terry,2011-12-20 10:40:00,14456,the spring steel scratchers work very well but you bugger them up if you go in reverse   I have these too I mount them on my skis when conditions are real bad and you can go in revers with these ones    http://www.firstplaceparts.com/15-6430.html?gclid=CKPq17K6kK0CFYHrKgoddj0p6A    
649787,ecmilley,2011-12-20 12:17:00,2163,"spring steel ones work great, as do the ski mounted cable ones, there is also a fin style that can screw to the inboard side of the ski that is supposed to work well and you can go in reverse"
649811,mike rousseau,2011-12-20 14:31:00,4661,What are the purpose of these scratchers your talking about...?  Having a hard time wrapping my head around this one...
649812,BillM,2011-12-20 14:42:00,17367, Cools the sliders and for the aircooled sleds cools the exchangers as well.
649813,mike rousseau,2011-12-20 14:52:00,4661,Ah... Better tell my brother then... He burnt his sliders of in a couple days last year...  Not much snow on the st.lawrence...
649816,irishfield,2011-12-20 15:27:00,26272, That would be the heat exchangers for the liquid cooled sleds... but we knew what you meant!
649821,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-20 15:38:00,10439,  I guess you could mount them so they throw snow into the fan of an air cooled sled for Bill so he can be cool too.
649834,BillM,2011-12-20 16:58:00,17367,"I'm a snowmobile rube if you guys haven't figured that out yet, lol!!!  My parents neighbour said the spiked track on mine chews up enough ice as is, no need for these things."
649837,fishnsled,2011-12-20 17:13:00,3520,"  Would disagree with the neighbour. Seen a few sleds over the years over heat from the lack of snow, even with a studded track. Might be enough to lube the sliders but I wouldn't bet on that."
649857,porkpie,2011-12-20 18:36:00,2521,  Spray some pam on your sliders!
649863,fishnsled,2011-12-20 18:49:00,3520," Not going to keep the sled cool but will might make the cooling fins non-stick so you could do a couple of eggs.  For the sliders, I've heard of dish soap as well. I had a buddy that drilled holes in the slides and injected them with a high heat grease. Seemed to help."
649866,BillM,2011-12-20 19:01:00,17367, Luckily for me I'm rarely if ever out on glare ice with no snow
649871,Sharkbait22,2011-12-20 19:08:00,297," Irishfield, Thanks for your reply.  How do the bolts fit on the skis?  I have steel skis with plastic skins.  I have a 3"" 3/8 (grade 5) bolt.  I'm most concerned about it damaging the ski (egging-out the hole). I'll likely see how these store bought scratchers work first but the bolts would be cheap additonal protection."
649872,Sharkbait22,2011-12-20 19:12:00,297," I have studds (109 of them) and my slides melted a bit last year.  I tried to hit the snow vs ice patches as much as possible. Even had my feet down at times to dig in the snow, but they still melted a bit. Legs were a tad sore after 14km.  BTW- my scratchers were bought for $60.  They tuck up out of the way when not needed."
