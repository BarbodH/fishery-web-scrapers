649883,Rod Caster,2011-12-20 19:48:00,5784," A bit smaller than the 4runner, but check out the new Kia Sorento. I rented one the other day and it is a very nice SUV especially for the $$. That engine pulls like a steroid donkey and it's loaded with options. I'm sure many people will balk at Kia, Heck even I do, but this thing is worth a double look. They have definitly improved they vehicles."
649929,Billy Bob,2011-12-20 22:07:00,5865,So I guess it's a Toyota 4Runner....good choice...you will never look back with a Toyota....and maybe someday you can get a TUNDRA.....

650006,Michael_Brown,2011-12-21 02:03:00,411,"I bought a Hyundi AWD Santa Fe a few years back. The thing is bulletproof, the single best winter driving vehicle I have ever owned and the only reason I go to dealer is for a visit. It has a 3.3L V6 and towed an 18ft Lund and then a 17ft Triton, never an issue. Averages 10L/100km for regular driving and 12.1L/100km towing the triton back from Kentucky at 120km. Great warranty, no problems, great to drive and I'm not a small guy. Well designed and seats 5. The bride will not let me sell it unless we get another one.  I get a new vehicle every year at work and domestics are getting better but even though they are covered by warranty I get annoyed getting something fixed every couple of months. I owned a Dodge truck for a couple of years, make sure you get the option of the tow-behind fuel wagon. Nice looking but terrible mileage. Chevy Sierra with a 4.8L engine was a good truck but I will stick with the Hyundai.  Great family/driving vehicle. Works for us.     I'm sure we are just confusing you but hey you asked for advice..."

650032,Sharkbait22,2011-12-21 03:12:00,297,One thing not mentioned here is the beauty of part-time 4x4 for backroads and messy snow.  My current vehicle is full 4wd which doesn't seem to cut it. Live and learn. I think the 4runner is part-time as do most of the trucks.  Many SUV aren't. Jeep seems to have several 4x4 configs.  Also having owned a few trucks I went to an SUV for the added interior space and security.  In the truck I often looked behind me to see this big empty box that I used once and while. Had my hockey gear stolen one year too and I had a cap on the box. Now I have a landscape trailer which I can beat and use for all sorts of jobs.
650440,Fisherman,2011-12-22 21:35:00,7201,"Just for the curiosity on my side, I sat down and tallied up all the fuel used since new, 19 Jul 04 until a couple days ago, 15,345litres for 114,522km, works out to as close to 21mpg as you can get.  City/highway combined pulling a 22' travel trailer or a 16'boat.  I don't think any of the gas engines can come close to this in reality, no matter how much the manufacturers say the can. Beyond that, it will pull far more than a 22' trailer without a lot of effort."

Bottom line no truck or large SUV is going to give you great gas mileage.....if someone tells you different...well then, I have a bridge for sale...  But if you want a Big Strong RELIABLE truck get the Toyota Tundra and you will never go back to the Ford, Dodge or GM vehicles again...and yes they ""may"" cost more at the time of purchase but they hold their value much better when it's time to trade it in.  I have also owned many vehicles and I have sworn off the Big Three forever....Toyota Tundra for hunting/fishing for me....Honda Civic for running around when I want great gas mileage."

Let's not even get into the debate about the Tundra vs everything else.  Should I start with the fact that the Tundra doesn't even have a SERVICEABLE REAR DIFF?????????  That's the mark of a real truck if you ask me, lol."
649608,Billy Bob,2011-12-19 21:13:00,5865," By who's mark....  Ford, GM and Dodge trucks need to be ""serviced quite often"" and that's why I no longer own one. My Tundra other then brakes and tires hasn't need any service in almost 5 years now.  Merry Christmas, Bob"
649609,kuhaman,2011-12-19 21:13:00,503,No point in servicing something that doesn't need servicing.
649612,kuhaman,2011-12-19 21:20:00,503,5.7 vortec is a great reliable engine. The stuff wrapped around that engine is not up to snuff in my opinion. Then again I couldn't afford any new truck unless it said tonka on it LOL

649700,JTorra,2011-12-20 02:03:00,50," Hate to disagree but the 4Runner will have a TON more room that the style of Blazer you are coming from Krawler.Not a Tahoe, but the S-10 based Blazer, much more space for sure. And the new Runner's are even larger than my 2007.  If you go for the 4runner you will not be disappointed."
649707,Rustic-Fisher,2011-12-20 02:15:00,826,"I have had Grand cherokees, Explorers, Xterra's, Jeep Wrangler and now drive a dodge Ram Megacab with the Hemi(should of got  cummins) Xterra (supercharged) = no problems until the head gasket went @1400000 KM   Jeep Wrangler= lacked cargo room, Unreal off road machine right out of the box. I really pounded that jeep heading in to brookie lakes up north and had no problems with it. Traded it in @ 60000km   Dodge Ram Megacab= tons of room for both dogs, hunting/fishing gear, and six passengers. I have over 80000kms on this truck and its by far the best rig I have owned.   Negative's are FUEL, parking in tight lots (truck is 20') and finally the big one..... can't get it down many ATV trails that I use to hit my brookie lakes. God forbid I ever had to turn it around on the trail. Trucks like fuel, no way around it. Past few years I have become interested in the Toyota Hilux, Surf,  and Land cruisers.

Back to reality, im leaning more and more towards the 4Runner.  Without taking the step up in truck size or buying a pickup it is the biggest model in its class.  Much larger than my 2 door blazer.  test drove an xterra last night, very cramped inside not for us big people, although i do like the rugged exterior.  The 4runner is pricey in canada.  Im getting quotes for 44 plus tax where as stateside im getting quotes for 33 plus tax for the same model.  Even with all these extra fees, buying in the states may be the best option!"

649202,krawler,2011-12-17 20:45:00,167,"Just got back from the Ford dealer, i like the F150!!  I'm interested in the supercrew but dealer told me the 3.7 V6 is not offered in it, only the Eco-boost or the V8 is offered in the supercrew.  Need to do some further research on the ecoboost.  But the deals they have are really nice on new trucks."
649205,irishfield,2011-12-17 20:54:00,26272,  I'm gonna say it just one more time... you DO NOT want the Eco-boost engine! Way too small an engine to be pushing a full size pickup let alone towing anything with it. That is why they are burning 18 litre/100 km vs the 5.0 only burning around 13litre/100km. The engine is working too hard to push an EMPTY truck. My older F150 had the 4.6 litre triton V8 in it.. just under 300 cu inches and it was working HARD to pull a heavy trailer... can't see the 3.7 even making it up the hill in North Bay from a red light at the McDonalds!
649223,Sharkbait22,2011-12-17 22:18:00,297,"Go with the bigger engine.  Little is gained by going smaller in mpg, but you loose potential power.  Newtons laws. The truck is still the same just a slightly heavier or lighter based on engine size. The truck without the engine still has the same mass. Sounds like the ecoboost is an ecobust."
649242,BillM,2011-12-17 23:37:00,17367," Dave, your Pilot is only AWD when the speed sensors kick in and the computer realizes the front tires are going faster then the rears..  Other then that, it's FWD..  I wish Honda had a better AWD/4x4 system with locking diffs..  (My BIL owns a Ridgeline, same deal)"
649244,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-17 23:55:00,10439,"  True but have you seen our roads? Starting in late October until April they are snow and ice covered. It's always kicking in the rears. I wish they were rear wheel drive with selectable 4X4. The fact that they are FWD first creates a lot of wear on the front tires as even on dry pavement if you give 'er a little too much gas the fronts slip just a bit until the rears kick in. It's a minor annoyance but an area I think they can improve on.  It does however have a center locking diff which will equally sperad the power to all four wheels but it's not the same as real front and rear locking diffs. It does work pretty good though but it only works in 1,2 or R and only up to 30kmh.  When I got my new tires a couple of springs ago I wanted to see how they were so I drove to my friends place on the ice and put 'er in low locked and crawled up the granite outcrop in front of their cabin. I would have easily made it except my trailer hitch hung up on the ice because I did not have a big enough departure angle. I was pretty impressed as it's pretty much a soccer mom mobile. It would be nice if Honda made a ""real"" truck."
649248,JTorra,2011-12-18 01:11:00,50,"Alright, true gearhead sounding off here....38 cars since 16. I'm only 37, Do the math. I have a sickness.  I had a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland with the H.O. V8 and LOVED it...when it wasn't being fixed. 2 front hub assemblies per side, 2 rear carrier bearings, broken window regulators (oddly, they always went went in the dead of winter, for extra P.I.T.A factor),$1600 climate control fix...and on and on. If I wasn't a bit of a wrench myself I would have gotten rid of it in the first 3 years instead of driving it for 5. It got 12.8L/100K on the highway to the cottage and 17.8 around town, consistently. Won't buy a Jeep again...after owning 3.  I just recently bought an 07 4Runner with 171K. Yes, 171K. It drives better than any Jeep I ever had when new. I did my research and unless Toyota is including lifetime ""massage spa"" memberships with their 4runners, there is a reason they seem to have a cult following based on reliability. I tow a 16' full windshield boat around and get 14-15L/100km. Set the cruise at 110km/hr on a long trip and I see 11.5L/100km in the summer, unloaded. It swallows up big bins of camping gear with ease, has a true 4wd system with 2wd mode and does VERY well offroad stock. I just did BFG AT's with a small lift so I can get Bill M and Wallacio back into some nice brookie lakes without them ruiningmy stuff in an ATV and trailer...  That said, I got sucked into the Ford Ecoboost marketing on their website and was very intrigued but I too have heard that 29 MPG is very optimistic, but the power is there for sure.  I would say drive a 4Runner. Maybe even save a whack of cash and looked used. They hold their resale value like nothing else, which will hurt you now but help you later.  My .02"

He drives london to North Bay twice a month and says he gets 30mpg. He  also pulls a 4000lb trailer with it and again says it does the job perfectly."
649294,bow slayer,2011-12-18 05:53:00,1074,"also to add my wife and I rented a brand new (only 20 kilometers on it) Silverado for a weekend,let me say this what a piece of crap the f150 has it beat everywhere ride,handling comfort. There is a reason gm holds down 4 out of the  top 10 spots of  worse reliability list. I have always been a gm guy and I still own a 1987 buick Grand National I bought brand new but it will be the last in my drive way."

649452,krawler,2011-12-19 02:25:00,167,"After test driving a few vehicles this weekend, studying the specs, reading reviews online, i came to the conclusion that a big SUV or truck does suit my growing family and my lifestyle such as an F150 or Tahoe. However one obstacle stands in the way; the fact that these are all as bad on gas or worse than my current vehicle which was something that i wanted to improve on.  The F150 does seem like a good choice but there are too many bad reviews on the ecoboost most people call it the ecoBUST, the V8 is a guzzler and the V6 does not come in the supercrew option. Other pickups on the market are likely just as bad or worse on gas than the F150.  Size is a factor for me, i need ample storage space and the ability to tow an 18' lund, the only reasonable choice right now is the Toyota 4Runner.  It's as close to a tahoe or f150 as i can get and still have ample space, comfort, reliability for the whole family.  The cross over market is not for me and it seems as though the explorer is heading in that direction based on consumer demand.  Thanks for the help OFC!  I appreciate all the opinions.  I have not purchased the toyota yet so my mind is not completely made up.  i enjoy the search for a new vehicle and enjoy reading everyones thoughts and opinions, so feel free to keep them coming, for all i know i could be wrong in my choice but will continue to do my research.  thanks again  k"

649519,craigdritchie,2011-12-19 15:59:00,1586,"Toyota 4Runner is a very good truck - powerful engine, quiet ride, high quality, and very well made. But you said you were looking for more interior space than you have in your current Blazer, which is one thing the 4Runner just won't really give you. Like your current truck, it's a mid-sized vehicle that was originally designed around a V6. It might be a little more spacious that a four-door Blazer but not by that much.  The Chevy Tahoe gets excellent fuel economy for a full-size SUV. Last one I drove (GM press car) had the 5.3L V8, and cost about $90 to fill from E. For that, I got about 475 km, which works out to something like 15 L/100 km.  By comparison, I seem to recall that last time I drove a 4Runner (also a press car) it had the 4L V6 and cost about $70 to fill, taking me about the same distance. That works out to around 13 L/100 km.  Bear in mind, both of these are brand-new vehicles still being broken in. But you get the idea. There's not as much fuel economy difference as you might think.  If you want more space, you're most likely looking at a full-sized truck of some kind. If you want better fuel economy than you already get, you're most likely looking at a newer mid-sized. Sorry to say, you can't have both in a 4x4 SUV."

The fuel millage is not that different but the room and power of the Titan is a lot higher. The Titan is poor mileage in the city but the highway driving it is very respectable. I drive my Titan with a load of gear and a Ranger bass boat up and over the mountains to Canada every year and it is a real pleasure between the comfort and the ease of towing you will hardly feel the boat behind you. 14 Hours in the seat and you can still walk the next day too.

Pulling my 176 Princecraft Pro 115hp Johnson and a 9.9 Honda kicker. I got 15.5 Miles to the gallon. I try and keep it under 2000 Rpm. It's a Truck, when I need the power, it's there. Steep ramps, Heavy loads, know worries. One draw back, tires very expensive 18"" $350.00 each. Just a heads up example. I have been thinking about going to the darkside  ""RAM"" nice looking truck, ""but"" it's a Dodge"

649026,myot,2011-12-16 22:52:00,131,  I have two friends who have the same year F150 one with the ecobost V6 on with the 5L the ecobost V6 does everything and more than the V8 its smoother quieter better on fuel more power tows better. I belive he gets close to 1250km to a 120L tank 30mpg. As for comfort thats a matter of personal preference I have been in many full sized trucks and also owned a Dodge Ram and I would say that the Ford is on par with all the full sized trucks comfort wize but alot better fit and finish on the interior   Dan

649042,ecmilley,2011-12-16 23:52:00,2163,"THere are many vehicles that would work for you, depends on what you like. Towing you really can't beat a v-8 comfort is a matter of opinion i am 6'1 and 230ish i find the x-terra and toys a little cramped,the mitsus have a good drivetrain but feel cheap, jeep wranglers good off roading 2 doors limited in storage and I don't like how they feel towing cherokee not bad overall (still a dodge though) again f-150 4 door not a bad truck, I feel they need work in the seats as well dodge trucks look ok, most likely typical mopar quality control if you get a good one it'll be the best truck ever, otherwise you'll be cursing it. I prefer gmc trucks, best seats in the biz awesome soundsystems big drink holders, best hwy fuel mileage in the biz and you should see the places my stock z-71 can go. seen add in the paper this week 4x4 ext cab nevada edition 26700 and 4 door 4x4 was 28ish, looking at the build sheet for my truck from 2003 it was 43780 can't believe how trucks came down in price. but with a family nissan armada, tahoe's/yukons chrysler aspen/durango are all good suv's to look into"
649044,scugpg,2011-12-17 00:05:00,1373,If you get a GM with the 5.3 and the 3.08 (I think) gears it should be decent on gas. It was rated around 30mpg as well with those gears. Depends how much you need to tow.
649052,Dutch,2011-12-17 00:21:00,831," Couldn't have said it better myself, Lew.  I have the same truck and I really like it."
649057,irishfield,2011-12-17 00:40:00,26272,"  Well I meet a cop at a ride check tonight that would totally disagree with that. While asking me if I'd been drinking he said to me ""what engine do you have in this"". I told him the 5.0 Coyote engine and he said ""you're kidding me... No way.. 12.8 litres/100km!!"". Shows how observant he was.. he'd already read my dash LCD! He said that ""his piece of crap had the econoboost engine in it and he was averaging 18.1 litres/100km with it"". I really  made his afternoon when I told him I hadn't reset my computer since towing a trailer!!!  How you can get quieter than the 5.0 in a 2011 is beyond me, I can't even hear it running half the time and think it has shut off."
649065,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-17 01:46:00,10439, An easy fix for that is a Magnaflow cat back exhaust system. A couple of hours of your time and your anemic sounding F150 will sound like a manly real truck.
649074,Millhouse2020,2011-12-17 02:38:00,152,"I have to vote for the F150.  I bought a new 2011 in January of this year and it has been great.  Its a 5LV8 FX4 with a supercab and 6.6`foot box.  It pulls my 18`Crestliner fine and has been better than expected on gas if driven sensibly.  I love the fact that I can just toss my gear in the box and go.  Its a fine looking machine as well.  I had initially wanted a Toyota 4 runner but by comparison they are much much more money for the same or similar options.  The F150 comes in a V6 Echo boost which is supposed to be a phenomenal new engine.  I have been driving my truck all year, its got 14000 kms on it and hasnt required an oil change yet.  Its got a smart system which monitors oil and other engine and vehicle systems and notifies you when you need to change oil or need other service.  Have not been into the dealership since I bought it.  Mind you, I expect to bring it in soon for an oil change since the oil life is around 9% now I think.  I don`t think you will be disappointed, I havent been.  The deals on pickups now just cant be beat and Ford is making a great product.  My fiance and I tested all the major brands and were impressed with Ford the most, the Dodge Ram was a close second and we considered buying but the Ford was more affordable for us.  Plus given that you are a big fella, the pickup will accomodate you comfortably and you can select a number of different configurations for the cabin and box.  Plus tons of accessories if you like.  We love the backup camera and sensors since its been an adjustment driving such a big vehicle and the camera is also great for trailering.  Lets me hitch up all alone without any issues...  Have fun with your purchase!"

649087,Sinker,2011-12-17 04:06:00,8692,Around here its called the Ecoboom!
649089,irishfield,2011-12-17 04:23:00,26272, If I'm nice to it on the highway I can get it down to 11.7 litre/100 km Paul with cruise set at 112kph. General all around driving I'm averaging about 13.6 litre/100km. I'd just returned from Newmarket on cruise at 118kph when I encountered the ride check on the 400/93 ramp and the computer was showing 12.8
649096,krawler,2011-12-17 05:30:00,167,"Wow lots of interesting views and opinions.  Seems like Ford is getting a lot of votes.  I dont tow as much as most of you guys probably do therefore if i was going for the F150 i would likely go for the V6 without the ecoboost. Im just not sure if a pickup is geared toward my lifestyle.  Im surprised many of you dont have opinions on the 4runner.  it seems very spacious and the fuel mileage is good.  I would love to get a Tahoe but am afraid the fuel mileage would be the same or worse than my blazer (16L per 100km).  What is the fuel economy of a tahoe realistically.  I am going to look at Jeeps tomorrow but i think they may be too small and too expensive for me.  Also going to look at the F150 again and really consider a pickup as an option, i do a lot of city driving in toronto, mon-fri.  keep the info coming i enjoy the reading."
649097,ecmilley,2011-12-17 05:51:00,2163,"toyotas are nice but for the size of there engines the do get terrible city fuel mileage, friends with a 4 runner and a honda ridgeline actually use mor fuel than my 4.8l v8 seirra in all conditions all similar power i figure"
649098,Henricus,2011-12-17 06:10:00,118,"I am coming up on my one year anniversary with my '08 Yukon Denali.  Because of the mileage I wouldn't recommend it but otherwise the truck is awesome.  It's all wheel with the 6.2liter engine so mileage could be better...albeit it's a lot of fun when you air it out.  The SLT's come with the smaller 8 and I don't think they are full time all wheel drive so they would be better in the mileage dept.  Space, towing, comfort and features, the truck just can't be beat.  Before you rule one out, take it for a drive.  You will never look back.  Good luck Rick"
649118,danbouck,2011-12-17 13:47:00,4380, The mileage will be slightly worse with a Tahoe
649152,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-17 16:09:00,10439, I won't deny that the fuel mileage could be better on the Honda's. The full time all wheel drive knocks it down a bit.  I will also say that the new Sierra's are nice and get excellent mileage. And as an added bonus the seats are really comfortable.
649153,Tybo,2011-12-17 16:17:00,1373,Wayne. What does your truck get in fuel just running under the rev limiter.
649154,irishfield,2011-12-17 16:24:00,26272, With or without the traction control turned off???
649167,Canuck2fan,2011-12-17 17:00:00,1444,"Krawler if you do go new with any manufacturer shop around, check out ALL the incentives and find out which ones are stackable. For example on some fords you can get up to 3000 on trading in your gas guzzler, another 1000.00 off if you are a costco member, plus whatever other incentives are available at the time of purchase. Dealer incentives change a couple of times a month too. Also check the small town dealerships if you are going with a real truck of any type. They will often smoke big city auto marts on truck pricing because they sell more trucks to farmers. The last truck I bought I got in a small town 15 minutes from where I live. 4 dealerships in KW, Hamiltion and the GTA told me they couldn't even buy the truck themselves for what I paid...  So many good deals and makes out there right now it is a bit of a buyer's market, bargain hard once you know what you want."

648907,krawler,2011-12-16 15:35:00,167,"Its getting close to buying a new SUV, my chev blazer is getting to small for the family and its time for a 4 door.  I dont like the trend of many manufacturers going to a cross over vehicle.  That being said my choices are limited.  I travel to the cottage every weekend throughout the year, need a suv for my finacee, 2 dogs and loads of gear.  I often trailer my 16'lund Alaskan back and forth from toronto to the cottage and always pulling road trips for skiing or fishing.  On occasion i like doing some minor off-roading as well.  Ideally something more fuel efficient than my current blazer would be nice.  Options as of now are 2012 Nissan Xterra, Toyota 4runner and even considering and F150 but only the V6 model. I am willing to buy used if i can find a good deal.  If you have any experience with the above mentioned suv's please post your likes or dislikes and fuel mileage info.  My budget is around the $40,000 mark.  thanks for your help. i hope this post may help others in their search for an suv as well, i assume some people may be in the same situation as i am.  If anyone is interested in a fully loaded 03 Chevy Blazer ZR2 150,000km, please let me know."

648911,davew3,2011-12-16 15:47:00,430,For the price check out the 2012 Dodge Ram quad cabs.  Lots of room and a good price for a brand new vehcile.  Regards

648927,Skipper D,2011-12-16 16:42:00,1970,"One of the things we ran into was the all wheel drives is it means no two wheel drive if you want it , every one knows when your in two wheel drive you burn less gas then you do when your in four wheel or the all wheel drive , We walked away from a new Commander last winter for that reason and it blew the sales man away , he know i was right , but each to hhis own i guess ."

He has ridden as a passenger in my Pilot and did not look wholey unconfortable even with the seat forward due to there being 3 more peeps in the back seat (all dressed in wading gear I might add).  The Mitsubihi's are nice but I find them a little lacking in overall quality of components. The guy that works for me had an '08 Outlander and I found that it was hollow sounding when closing the doors (like they really should have dynamatted them to make it more solid sounding). The Endevour may be different and they do have an excellent warranty."
648958,bigbuck,2011-12-16 19:06:00,2449,"New F150 with the EcoBoost engine will do all you ask of it and more. The fuel economy will be on par or a bit better than your current truck with more usefulness. And besides, its a real truck."
648969,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-16 19:57:00,10439,  The only problem with it is it's excruciatingly painful on long trips as the seats are about as comfortable as old wooden bleachers.
648978,esoxansteel,2011-12-16 20:29:00,1307,"If you like 60,000 km warranties buy a Ford F150, my company truck is one, and a V6 its a pig on fuel, its on its 3rd CD player and 3rd fuel pump, and Ford says in the manual that you only have to change the oil every 12,000kms, and you know what that leads to, hence the 60,000km warranties I guess  My personal vehicle is a Jeep Grand Cherokee LTD with a 5.7 litre HEMI it gets 27mpg on the hwy and 18 in the city, and has tons of pep, has the MDS as well where it cuts back to 4 cylinders if your not on the pedal hard, my previous vehicle was the same with a 4.0 Litre I-6, that was bullet-proof and has over 450,000 kms and is still going strong"
648980,solopaddler,2011-12-16 20:31:00,8605," F150 is a great choice imo, but you'll get way better gas mileage on the hwy, especially towing with a V8.  The V6 in a full sized truck is working too hard and gas mileage suffers.  I drove to Nakina twice this year in 2 different full sized F150 crew cab 4X4's.  Great vehicles, tons of room, and believe it or not just slightly more expensive to drive up there and back than my 2.4L 4 cylinder Nissan XTrail. I was absolutely amazed.  Ford has lots of incentives right now too if you're in the market."
648982,BillM,2011-12-16 20:33:00,17367," Mike, the EcoBoost is a turbo charged V6 making 365hp/420ftlbs.   It's pretty much dead on with the V8 motors that Ford offers.  Now a normal, naturally aspirated V6, absolutely...  I'd pick a V8 over that anyday..."
648986,Fang,2011-12-16 20:38:00,1330,"If you're close to an Autopark Krawler, drop by and test drive a few to get a feel for size and comfort. I've bought my last several vehicles from them (gently used). When we bought my wife's SUV (GMC Envoy) we test drove a Toureg, Murano, Cadillac SUV, Ford Edge and a few other I can't recall all in one afternoon.  I wanted to drive a Hummer H3 and the Ford 250 but my wife wouldn't let me.  I've got a Ford expedition and love it. Been looking at the Honda Pilot as a possible replacement in the next year or so"
648988,bigbuck,2011-12-16 20:44:00,2449,Cherokees are kinda nice too but I've had a bad experience with JEEP and would never go back. Ford is staking a lot on the new motor and I think it will be a good one. I haven't heard anything really bad about them.
648993,craigdritchie,2011-12-16 20:50:00,1586,"I think you'll find both the the Xterra and the 4Runner have about the same amount of space as the Blazer. None of them are particularly roomy vehicles compared to a full-size truck.  If you're comfortable with a used vehicle, you can find plenty of good deals on lease-return Suburbans and Tahoes. Depreciation on these is huge, so you can save a bundle by going with a two- or three-year old truck. Most of these were only used to go to and from the mall, mainly by people who like to buy the image of being rough and adventurous. They're surprisingly good on gas, and will tow pretty much anything.  If you prefer a new vehicle, Ford's current pricing deals are really hard to beat."

I've got the Supercrew and the space in the back seat is unbelievable, specially with the rear seat folded up and it would be fine for your dogs.  It's very comfortable, even the seats that Drifter doesn't seem to like  Mines got the 5.4 V-8 and it's more than enough power to haul my 3500 pound boat around. Mileage isn't all the great but I knew that going in and if I was concerned about gas mileage, I woulda bought a Honda Civic."
649000,solopaddler,2011-12-16 21:20:00,8605,  So no difference in gas mileage then between the two?
