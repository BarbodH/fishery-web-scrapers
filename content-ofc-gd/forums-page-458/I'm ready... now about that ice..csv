649384,kickingfrog,2011-12-18 18:21:00,8333,Still thinking it might be 2012 before there is ice for me to fish.  
649388,misfish,2011-12-18 19:08:00,29133,"If all going to plan Rob,I,ll be on the ice before that."
649389,Rob,2011-12-18 19:13:00,467, Little lake or St. John  You off for the holidays Brian

649399,asdve23rveavwa,2011-12-18 21:25:00,2690, Now that's what I'm talking about!!!  Bring it ON!!
649400,BillM,2011-12-18 21:27:00,17367,Lots and lots of steel out there boys   No ice fishing equipment required!
649401,asdve23rveavwa,2011-12-18 21:30:00,2690, Might take advantage of that during my week off at Christmas!
649402,Leecher,2011-12-18 21:44:00,7832, You can Rob... Up in La Belle Province that is One as backup and you're go to go
649412,NAW,2011-12-18 22:54:00,4022,"Little Lake in Midland, and Orr lake are both skimmed over today.  No sign of open water at all.  Temps aren't looking amazing for the next few days.  But at least it's gunna be cold at night.  Should be able to get out somewhere before 1012"
649431,livinisfishin,2011-12-19 00:46:00,661,Geting two new ice rods this year..should make my fishing a bit more productive...would be interested in getting out with you guys from barrie if you don't mind a tag along!
649763,limeyangler,2011-12-20 07:22:00,5204,i like the look of rods 1 and 3  (top to bottom)
649932,kickingfrog,2011-12-20 22:11:00,8333, Those are my favourite walleye rods. The bottom three are laker sticks for 100 foot water.
650300,limeyangler,2011-12-22 12:34:00,5204,  I knew there was a reason i liked 'em!  I dont tend to use the bigger style rods.....so far i've not hooked into any 'monster' lakers and rarely fish deeper than 60' for them......i find my walleye set ups with a tube jig does the trick for lakers.
650405,iceslayer,2011-12-22 19:37:00,97,   How much ice you got up there limeyangler??  Might be worth the drive...lol
