650120,ch312,2011-12-21 16:08:00,1590," unfortunately, i don't have any that i can think of. this was about 10 years ago or longer and i've lost any that i had. walking around the neighborhood with him on my shoulder definitely got a few reactions to say the least.   as for oppossums being aggressive after being cornered. show me a wild animal that isn't willing to defend itself after being cornered. coons, possums, squirrels, rats, canines, felines, groundhogs, nearly everything around here will defend itself. hell, even gerbils and hamsters are known for biting their owners when they don't want to be bothered. it's something called instinct"
650122,torco,2011-12-21 16:19:00,656,My brother inlaw tells me they can be pretty vicious when cornered. His shops guard dogs kill many things including possums usually if its a racoon or something they are no worse from the wear but when they kill possums they usually have some battle wounds the next morning.  Of course the poor possum doesn't stand a chance to win because its 2 on 1 but can still do some significant damage. I'd be worried about your dog.

650351,keiths,2011-12-22 17:19:00,30,"Sounds like a cool pet, beats a coon for sure"
649750,HTHM,2011-12-20 04:14:00,4082,"I have a possum that has decided my deck is a good place to hang out. We have seen him two nights in a row and both times my lab chased it away into a corner and wore her vocal cords out barking at it. Can they cause any problems? I don't want to have to deal with it if it won't be a problem, kind'a a cute critter actually. Not at all aggressive even when completely cornered. Mind you my lab wouldn't hurt anything, she'll just bark at it trying to figure out why it doesn't want to play."
649753,irishfield,2011-12-20 04:30:00,26272,"They are ""Opossums"" in Canada and a similar nuisance as Racoons. Biggest issue to pets will/would be flea transfer and the diseases that can go with it."
649754,Dozer,2011-12-20 04:32:00,896,"Lucky, the possum around our neighbourhood is a nasty fellow.  Our possum eats our grapes and we find fecal matter all over the roof."
649755,HTHM,2011-12-20 04:39:00,4082,looks like my son in law is gonna come over with his twelve gauge.

649778,solopaddler,2011-12-20 10:58:00,8605,  Is your son in law Jethro?  I hear granny makes a mean possum pie.  
649782,Billy Bob,2011-12-20 11:45:00,5865,A .22 long rifle will dispatch the  possum problem with a LOT less noise if your concerned with how loud the muzzle report will be.  Wild animals are never a good thing close the house.  Bob
649793,Chuck Best,2011-12-20 13:22:00,308,"We had one in our yard,but he departed when I introduced him to my hard rake,no all know ,but they fart similar to a skunk and can be VERY nasty when cornered,and they're not originally from around here ,so I had no problem helping him to depart....TC and tight lines all.... Chuck..."

649815,jimmer,2011-12-20 15:26:00,2730,We had one around our pool during the spring thaw one year. Never saw him again after that day. They usually move on if there isn't any food around. They do have wicked teeth.

649848,Fang,2011-12-20 17:51:00,1330,I got it right away when I read it. one of my favs  laziest possum ever  My link
649851,mercman,2011-12-20 17:58:00,7054,  NOW i remember.....too funny.Ever notice how all the old women smoked a pipe back then   weird.
649852,ch312,2011-12-20 17:58:00,1590,"considering i had a possum from baby to 2 years of age, i'm probably the only one here that would suggest relocating it. their life expectancy in the wild is only 18 months, so he won't be around long anyways.  it's amazing how easy it was to litter train him and it was like having a cat, but way cooler and more affectionate than most cats.  he tops the list for my coolest pet so far."
649853,Rizzo,2011-12-20 18:07:00,4754, you have low standards  . A possum is like a giant rat but twice as ugly and 3 times as mean. If you have found a gentle one you're lucky...most will fight back when cornered...that's when they meet Mr 9 iron
649960,SirCranksalot,2011-12-20 23:56:00,3291,"Do they make good bait, for pike for e.g. and, if so, can they be bred in captivity?"
649962,Dozer,2011-12-21 00:05:00,896," Super cool, post any pictures?"
650033,northernpike56,2011-12-21 03:16:00,717,"They are pretty much the same as raccoons. They will knock over all your garbarge and tear it apart to eat, leave poop EVERYWHERE, and they can get real mean when cornered. I had one that decided he would like to move in with me so I ended up trapping him and re-locating him on the other side of the QEW."
650072,Rizzo,2011-12-21 12:56:00,4754,ya the side with the moving traffic
