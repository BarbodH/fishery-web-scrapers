The only ice is on very small lakes, and you could throw a rock threw the thin ice that does exist. Large lakes are completely free of ice. I think that trout opener may be an open-water affair this year."

650217,skeeter,2011-12-22 01:00:00,1907,Well there's a little more ice on them today. The rock cuts along 35 have solid ice where the water usually seeps out of.
