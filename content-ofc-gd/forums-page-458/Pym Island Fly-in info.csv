I have read a few great posts regarding past trips and was looking for any advice  or tips regarding everything from lure selection to packing the right things, or any additional knowledge or experiences that would enhance out trip. Thank you in advance."
650118,BillM,2011-12-21 16:05:00,17367,You can throw anything there to catch pike   Personally I like a Johnson silver minnow with a big white 5in twister tail on the back.  Walleys will hit anything as well..

650147,gatorchaser,2011-12-21 18:00:00,5,  Thanks for that! I will check into Attawapiskat for more info.
650164,Moosebunk,2011-12-21 18:58:00,3970,"2011 Trip -   http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=55120  2008 Trip -   http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=21455   Agree with Bill... anything could work.  If I had to pick just 3 lures I'd go with what Bill already said as one of them.  Second, an inline-bucktail spinner like the ""L'il Hustler"" as that's what has killed 'em for me in the two trips.  And lastly, jigs and twister-tails.  Gotta catch eyes to eat, and they'll catch pike too.  Something weedless is a must... there's plenty other things you could experiment with that'd work too.  Your trip conditions in July should be more like what we had in the 2011 trip.  You'll then rely more on the guide for river travel, but you'll be quick to learn spots.  For food... find out if anyone has things they won't eat.  Then one of you plan each meal for the week (you can count on fish meals) so you have an entire menu.  From that menu you should be able to almost count the eggs and everything else needed to the perfect amount.  This will keep your weight down when shopping for only what you know you'll need... and I remember in 2008 we left only some jam and eggs behind, and ate like kings.  Our limit was 500lbs for 5... and we weighed in just 10 pounds over.  You'll have a great time.  It's an amazing place, amazing camp.  Harry and Norman are two cool Ogoki dudes who have traveled the entire 800km length of that river in their freighter canoes.  Depending when you go, sturgeon might be open too.  They'll know a spot or two near camp you could always try drowning a chunk of meat for a half hour or so.  Good luck.  Tell Melanie I say hello.  Looking forward to the report."
650172,gatorchaser,2011-12-21 19:36:00,5,"Thanks Moosebunk, I have viewed your past trip reports and enjoyed them alot,so much so that we changed our plans to go to from Napken to Pym based on your reports! Maybe you should get a cut from Hearst Air..  . We are going in the first week of July, so we are hopeful to have some of the same luck you were able to have. Thanks for the tips and if you think of any other bit of info we may need please post. Looking forward to posting after the trip with some pics."
650720,fisherman7,2011-12-24 15:20:00,325,  I've been to both Napken and Pym and Pym is my favourite but Napken was a good second bet. One piece of advice I'll give is get the guide for the first two days. Have them take you up river and down river. After that you can go on your own. It's an awesome place to fish and I'll be heading back at some point. Hearst Air is a first class operation and you won't be disappointed.
