649990,GBW,2011-12-21 01:34:00,8460,"Found on another site...  VHS (viral hemorrhagic septicemia) has been confirmed in gobies, perch, and bullheads in Lake Simcoe. The Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) responded late this past December by creating a new zone around Simcoe up to Gravenhurst where baitfish movements by commercial sellers will not be allowed in or out as of January 1, 2012.  article"
650005,FishAbout,2011-12-21 02:00:00,106,Going to put the price of minnows up in the area past gravenhurst. Does this mean lake erie shinners can be sold in around simcoe now?
650008,GbayGiant,2011-12-21 02:08:00,1780,"If it's in Lake Simcoe, it is all through the Severn system and more than likely all ready through the great lakes."
650016,dhickey,2011-12-21 02:21:00,1038,Well we all saw it comming so I guess its time to learn new fishing techniques. I have always been a bait fisherman mainly if I may speek for my self it realy pisses me off when ignorant people bring bait in from other regions  No respect for local eco systems  Ignorance is not bliss but rather a pain in the  for those that respect nature  Rant done  (4 now)
650039,mercman,2011-12-21 03:47:00,7054,"Back in July, i was talking with a local bait shop owner, and he predicted this ,i believe. He spoke of a meeting between bait collectors/sellers and the MNR taking place in September, and possibly the partial banning of live minnow sales."
650065,outllaw,2011-12-21 12:08:00,1232,"Sadly, vhs will make its appearence in most waters. We rant and rave,but the true lawbreakers are. goverment,shipping, . Invasive species we have are to many to type. Here where i live in southern ontario,we have watched, diseases and different species invade. just think.With global warming,inaction from goverments,whats to come.. if one looks for laws on the books from our own mnr,a kid could do better. in lsc you can use canadian minnows, but u.s. visitors cant use them if there purchased in michigan, even if there dipped from the same lake. we need folks that actually understand biology, not pencil pushers."
650067,porkpie,2011-12-21 12:20:00,2521,I haven't used a minnow for perch fishing for years.  I have used them occasionally for pickeral though.... thats about the only time I'd miss it!
650075,Rizzo,2011-12-21 13:03:00,4754,haha porkpie you have a funny name. I will miss minnows during the ice fishing season but other than that not so much
650076,steverowbotham,2011-12-21 13:06:00,1800,"I rarely use live bait as it is, but this is not good news for the live baiters."
650082,lhousesoccer,2011-12-21 13:59:00,442,"The unfortunate fallacy of the OMNR's approach to VHS management is that VHS doesn't just ""show up"" and get detected immediately.  For the VHS virus to replicate in individual fish, and spread through the population and into multiple species, it takes time.  If VHS is detected in a waterbody, it's a pretty sure bet that it's been there for a year or two already prior to detection.  So - the OMNR allows baitfish harvest and distribution out of Simcoe until suddenly it comes up positive, and then they lock it down.  Guess what?  In all likelihood, VHS has been shipped out of Simcoe in emerald shiner catches for the last couple years.  Wherever those emeralds were taken and used as bait has a very real chance of becoming VHS positive now itself.  Too little, too late."
650083,Nipfisher,2011-12-21 14:02:00,2449,Need emerald shiners for walleye on Nipissing during the winter. My guess is we will see prices of $10-12 a dozen when the supply starts to run out.
650105,mike rousseau,2011-12-21 15:13:00,4661,  Need or want...?  I haven't seen a situation yet where artificails/lures/dead bait can't keep up with live bait...  You just have to put in time with different presentations... And work your lure...  No more dead sticking...
650141,motion,2011-12-21 17:25:00,403, Does this mean that the minnows cannot be harvested and moved out of the area or that they cannot be harvested at all?
650210,Nipfisher,2011-12-22 00:35:00,2449, On certain days dead sticking is the most productive. We generally have one tip-up out (dead sticking) with just a split shot and hook and shiner while we jig inside. However when the herring (cisco) are biting they will hit the jigs. Kind of a pain in the butt because the stink. Perch can be caught on either. There are times when a Sweedish Pimple or Williams will get you some eyes. Usually the big ones.
650216,mike rousseau,2011-12-22 00:54:00,4661,"  i started using a wind-lass tip up as my ""dead stick""  it harnesses the wind and jigs your line for you... this really helps with dead bait... you can even put a light spoon on (thin metal) during heavy winds and ill will really bounce..."
650236,Rizzo,2011-12-22 01:50:00,4754," I truly fish like a madman in the summer, don't stop to eat, drink, nothing...but come winter, if I can't just sit there and stare at 2 orange flags while doing absolutely nothing I ain't going"
650262,Nipfisher,2011-12-22 03:49:00,2449,"  Rizzo, you're welcome in my hut anytime. You ever get up to Nipissing P.M. We can stare at the tip-ups all day. Sometimes we just let the perch pull on the minnows. Not worth running outside sometimes if you know it's a perch."
