650504,Pguzik,2011-12-23 04:01:00,34,Hi guys need some help. Looking to buy a vex fl20 or marcum lx5. Im not interested i the lx-7 as it is toooo new and all computer  I have a Marcum 826sd and like the over all finish. Ive used a vex but never a marcum flasher. I liked the flat screen on vex.  I have read the Marcum has crisper detail of lines. Any opinion would be appreciated especially if you have used both units. Cheers guys WP

I've read that when only 1 chrystal used for both frequencies, the secondary frequency is not as 'clean' a signal. Whether it'll have much impact on finding the fish I couldn't tell you. Hopefully someone else can elabrate a little more. Was looking at the LX5 last year, but ended up liking/buying the Humminbird ICE 385Ci combo."

FL-18 . . . . 	when the FL-20 hit the stores, I couldn't resist the urge to 'keep up with the Jonses.' Well the FL20 is nice, but I'm afraid I liked the ol' FL-8 SE just as well. The only real complaint I have about the FL-20 . . . . .   too many numbers jammed into that small screen, gotta put my reading glasses on to read 'em! If ya got good eyes, I think you'll be VERY happy with an FL-20. One other potentially troublesome thing with a Marcum . . . . .    I set up about 50' away from one . . . . 	my Vex gave him a lotta interferance, I had to move a bit more to allow him to fish? Apparently the Vex will interfere with other flashers too? I'd check that out before plunkin' my money down."
