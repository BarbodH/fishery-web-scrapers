250142,BillM,2008-09-16 12:28:00,17367,Excellent job Roger!  Nothing beats a smile on a kids face  I'll make sure to hunt around for you the next time I'm in BPS!
250150,Headhunter,2008-09-16 12:52:00,5703,"Well Roger, I must admit that I am not at all surprised by this post... I've said it many times, you are the reason I go to BPS! You've just shown us all that I have been right the whole time! Kudos to you, the Daves and BPS for taking the time to help make a family happy. I understand some of the challenges the family faces as my son is also diagnosed as being ""high function"" autistic. It's hard work, but the rewards although different from most parents milestones in their kids lives are 2nd to none. You and your generous gesture have helped to reach a child who in all likelihood, has a difficult time reaching others. Thanks Roger... keep smiling! HH"
250161,jwl,2008-09-16 13:12:00,1056,"this is a great story, and a great example of what some of the people on this board are all about when it comes to helping others  the looks on the boy's face say it all  My wife's freind has a small boy facing simular problems, and it can be a big challenge for any family,something like this for the day can really help a family get a big possitive break from thier every day challenges"

Roger you are a great ambassador for the sport of fishing and for BPS. It's great people like you that make this sport what it is. Also thank you George and the whole gang from Bass Pro it is great to work with a company that CARES so much.  Dave Mercer"
250186,wuchikubo,2008-09-16 14:37:00,1114,"Thanks for sharing the story Roger, my nephew has autism too and I see how much work it can be through my brother and sister-in-law.  A great job by some great people at BPS. Give yourself a good pat on the back, as well as to the Daves and George.  Although I don't go to BPS that often, I'm always have ""meet Roger"" on my list to do when I'm there (you're usually off the times I've been there)."

250298,bassboy,2008-09-16 21:29:00,161,"Awesome story Roger!!!  I was there on Sunday too...in fact I was turning the corner to go down the Gulp aisle when they were taking those pictures with Dave Chong.....I wondered what was going on.  I witnessed how great Dave Mercer was with kids when I was waiting in line to meet him....he took time with everyone, but especially the kids. Its a great thing to see!!!  Both are true Gentlemen in every sense of the word!!!  Dave M must have thought I was a complete doofus.....all I could do when it was my turn was smile and say thank you half a dozen times!  DOH  Thanks to Roger, Dave and Dave for all they did that day, especially with young Jacob!  Things like that make a long drive worth it...I can see why you do it Roger!  Thanks for posting this!!  Bill"
250302,JohnF,2008-09-16 21:38:00,3494,Nice!  Thanks  JF
250305,Radnine,2008-09-16 21:46:00,1538,What a fantastic thing to read about. For every crummy thing you read or hear about there are a thousand stories like this that never get told. Thanks for telling this one. Jim
250374,brickNblock,2008-09-17 01:08:00,598,Great story Bud! Rog............ You'll never ever see a bad word from me bud nor have youever.....(BPS and its people) WTG. I know why you work there ............. pete    edit:   WTG Dave's ..Chong and Mercer
250404,Marty,2008-09-17 02:14:00,873,"Roger, thanks for sharing.  You certainly deserve some props for this one.   You were part of a magical events.   As for Dave Mercer, he gratiously provided some prizes for the OFC Lakair event in June and my 5 year old son (here in the states), loves his show.  He has a Dave Mercer autographed hat and a Fact of Fishing shirt that he reveres.  It was a true reflection of Dave to provide these materials as well as other items for the G2G.  As for BPS, they came up big for the event too.   Kudos to all."
250426,ProCameraGirl,2008-09-17 03:56:00,1,"Hello!  Thank you Roger for writing a wonderful story about my son Jacob and our fantastic visit at BPS.  It has been a wonderful experience getting to learn techniques and hear stories about fishing.  I can't thank you enough for giving us such a special time.  Dave Mercer You have become Jacob's idol.  He absorbs everything you do and say!  Can you tell me your secret?  Thank you so much for making this event a memorable one.  I was overwhelmed when Dave Chong was introduced to us in the store.  Dave and I talked for a bit and then all of a sudden Dave was gone?  So was Jacob?  I found them checking out the Gulp bait!  He gave us tips and explained how this product is biodegradable and how it is more environmentally friendly.  Each time we visit BPS we learn something new about the products that are hanging in the isles or where would be a good place to cast our lines close to home.  (Since Jacob would go fishing on a daily basis!)  This event that George Wallace put together in his office will be forever in our hearts.  I have honestly never in Jacob's entire life time seen him so happy as I did on that Sunday afternoon. Really a wonderful experience with all your sales staff and ambassadors.  Please try to keep understanding families with children/adolescence with Autism.   It's really hard to go shopping, but, not anymore at BPS!   Thank you for all your support while shopping in your store.  Roger your an amazing ambassador to BPS.  Cheerfully, Dee mother of a future great fisherman!"
250607,Ron,2008-09-17 22:12:00,1683," Firstly, in the above picture I'd be honoured to shake any one of those peoples hands, in fact I have shaken a couple of them, (Roger and George). I see the real heroes in this photo, each and every one of you. And to think I would be willing to drive for an hour and a half getting ROAD RAGE to go to BPS just to chat, I always look out for Roger, it's about 50/50 for the amount of times I see the poor smuck there. Always a lot of laughs.  My hats to you my friend. It's nice to see guys like you Roger going the extra mile and help the young kids take interest in this sport. I am still envisioning Jacob with the LED ball cap with all his loot lined up on the bed = PRICELESS!!  Thanks for making my day a better one bud.  Cheers, Ron..."
250620,mepps,2008-09-17 22:31:00,1301,Great stuff!
250656,Sandbag,2008-09-17 23:49:00,533,"Roger  My hat is off to you, both Dave's and George.  Truly a heartwarming story.  Made my day!!!!!!!!  Cheers  Craig"

250052,bpsbassman,2008-09-16 02:54:00,941,"People are always asking me why I would drive 100 kms to work at Bass Pro on weekends.  The following story might help explain it. I was working at Bass Pro a couple of weeks ago and I met this really cool customer.  His name is Jacob, he is almost 8 years old and his Mom told me that he suffers from severe autism, and that he goes through aggressive therapy through the week.  The two of them had discovered fishing together a few weeks previous and it had done miracles for Jacob.  It took him to a much better place.  Jacob was already quite knowledgeable and took a keen interest in everything I was showing him. I told them about Dave Mercer coming to the store on the 13th and that Jacob would really enjoy meeting him.  I contacted Dave and George Wallace (BPS Promotion Manager) and they arranged to meet Jacob in George's Office before Dave did his presentation. I met Jacob and his Mom in the store on the 13th and what followed was truly magical!  I first introduced them to George who was busy outside Bar-B-Qing hotdogs for Ducks Unlimited.   George dropped everything and led Jacob all over the store gathering goodies   By the time he was done, Big Dave was in his office waiting to meet Jacob and sign all the gathered paraphernalia.  As you all know, Dave is awesome with all kids, but he was exceptional with Jacob.  I really can't describe the feelings I had at that time, watching all this magic happening.     Later on he met Dave Chong and Chonger spent a ton of time talking and listening to Jacob.    This one says it all   His Mother says that she found light coming from under Jacob's bedroom door after he had gone to bed that night.  He had his shirt, hat, lures, Dave ""Bobble Head"" and all his other new found treasures all lined up on his bed and had his new LED hat light illuminating them in the dark. The fishing industry is blessed to have people like the 2 Daves (Mercer and Chong).   I witnessed something truly magical this weekend. What also impressed me was the length George Wallace went to ensure Jacob had a truly wonderful day.  I see Bass Pro continually getting trashed on this site and I find it particularly frustrating when I know of all the good works that BPS continually performs and so often done under the radar, not doing it for the publicity but because ""Its the right thing to do"" It wasn't only Jacob that was the beneficiary of all this attention.  I also saw the joy in his Mother's eyes as she was capturing these beautiful pictures through the lens of her camera.  She was obviously getting as much out of this new experience as Jacob was and was truly overwhelmed.   She is as brave as Jacob in dealing with the day to day challenges that were being masked by this magical moment. Combine that with meeting great customers like all the OFNers I meet and a fabulous team of co-workers in the Fishing Dept. and you might get an idea of what makes it all worthwhile! Kind of helps explain what makes that 100 km drive a non-event. "
250053,tibbs,2008-09-16 03:00:00,650,WOW!  You did an awesome thing there for him!  He sure looked happy!
250057,danc,2008-09-16 03:05:00,4677,What a touching story. Don't forget to give yourself a pat on the back too Roger.

250089,steverowbotham,2008-09-16 05:15:00,1800,"I used to drive from Lindsay to work at BPS 5 days a week.  Financially, I cant do it anymore, but I certainly don't regret it, a great place to work when you have great people like Roger to associate with, and the customers you meet from every walk of life.  Great job Roger!"
250091,Ramble,2008-09-16 05:40:00,713,That's fantastic. I'm glad there are other anglers out thier making the effort. Reminds me of the Great Denny Leeson.  -Ramble-

250097,SlowPoke,2008-09-16 08:37:00,2984, And I thought it was for the 'staff discount'  That was a great post Roger and another example of how a little time and effort from our lives can make a memory of a lifetime for someone else.  -Brian

As I read the story and viewed the images, I felt my eyes starting to fog over (damn allergies )  What a wonderful experience for Jacob.
