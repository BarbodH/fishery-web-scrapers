250796,Gerritt,2008-09-18 12:33:00,6129,Well after alot of searching... and I mean alot! I finally found exactly what I was looking for...  I would like to introduce you to Hunter.    He is the yellow with the black nose..    I pick him up on Oct 2nd... man is it going to be a long couple weeks!  He will certainly be a welcome companion.  (Hope no one sees this as spam..) Incase anyone is wondering I purchased him from Silver D Kennels.. More dedicated breeders you will not find. They are CKC registered and Hunters' Sire is a national field champion. http://www.silverdkennels.com/index.html  G.

250815,steve_paul,2008-09-18 13:35:00,658,"Nice looking pup G, hope you guys have many great years with Hunter."
250822,Landlocked,2008-09-18 14:08:00,171,Looks like a beauty!  Great choice on the black nose and big blocky head!
250831,snag,2008-09-18 14:29:00,1932,Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
250840,bbog,2008-09-18 14:47:00,665,That is one beauty you picked Gerritt. I'm a Golden Retriever guy myself but the Labrador Retriever is an extremely close second!!  Treat Hunter well and you'll get it back in spades.
250848,John,2008-09-18 15:05:00,2956,"Congrats Gerritt, very cute.  I sent you a PM by the way..."
250852,ccmtcanada,2008-09-18 15:13:00,7971,Awesome G!!! He looks like a fine puppy!
250854,Wendel,2008-09-18 15:16:00,213,"Nice choice Gerritt! I would have went with the Chocolate myself.  I miss my dog so much, wish I had my own place and I would get another in a heartbeat. Is this your first lab?"
250882,Tarzan's Jane,2008-09-18 16:52:00,1183,"Too cute....but you can have that 'Puppy Stage'!  And just a bit of a caution...when we got our Puppy (years ago), I ended up with a very nasty, nasty infection in my sinus.  It took over a year to detect as the pain was being felt in a tooth.  So...after the regular dentist then a specialist and then a final specialist (grumpy old man) who told me to lay off the advil (was taking 2 every 4 hours for a year) and to see my doc.  They were quite surprised with the x-ray and put me on heavy duty antibiotics for 21 days.  I finally was able to put the advil away after 14 days on the meds.  Give him a good bath when you get him home."
250888,Mr. Follow,2008-09-18 17:04:00,34,Congrats What a cute pup.
250902,LeXXington,2008-09-18 17:32:00,1928,ahhhhhh.. too cute.
250904,blaque,2008-09-18 17:36:00,2419, Man!.........way to rain on a cute puppy parade lol (jk)
250919,ChrisK,2008-09-18 18:15:00,2772,Fine pup you got there !!! Congrads....
250932,bbog,2008-09-18 18:54:00,665,"  Actually the advice is excellent. You want to get the puppy used to baths, paw handling, nail clipping, teeth brushing, ear cleaning, etc.  Nothing worse than a large ill mannered dog when trying to do the basic things that will ensure a long and healthy life.  Edited to add ear cleaning - how could I forget having a GR."
251004,Casey123,2008-09-18 22:52:00,461,Make sure he doesn't out fish you.
251029,Gerritt,2008-09-18 23:57:00,6129,"thanks for all the comments and advice guys and girls..  This is not my first lab, I grew up caring for them... and I chose him because he had a ""Box like head"" much like his father who in my eyes was stout and strong... Hunter was the largest in the litter too I should add..  I picked up a crate today from Albert (Hometownhandyman) what a great guy he is! I just wish I had alot more time to chat with him... Soon enough eh Albert?  Thanks to everyone for their comments.  G"
251079,Nanook,2008-09-19 02:13:00,565," Nice looking pup ya got there Gerritt, wish you many years together We just got ours last week,and he already makes a difference to our lives"
251092,HTHM,2008-09-19 03:28:00,4082,Thanks for the kind words. You failed to realize that we now have a obligation to go fishing together soon. (grin) I enjoyed meeting you as well. Use the crate in good health!
