250641,Dutch,2008-09-17 23:24:00,831," That's the thing - supply and demand are NOT currently driving the gas prices.  Market speculation is.  Gas prices are set using the daily NYMEX rates which have been all over the place lately.  S&D should be driving the price, but it's not - gas is not following the basic ""rules"" of economics, which is leading to huge problems in many areas - namely the US.  Market speculation in the US and the US sub-prime mess is dragging the entire World into a recession."
250643,Dutch,2008-09-17 23:31:00,831,"Another thing - I don't think that there is too many ""independant"" gas stations out there that actually ""own"" the gas they pump.  It is far too expensive and a comparatively small business for the ""big"" oil companies to sell to independants.  I would bet that most gas stations are filling up with Petro Canada, Shell, Mobil gas and taking a per litre commission for pumping the gas for the big companies.  Come the time the tanks are re-filled (or maybe when they are filled), the driver takes the readings on how much was pumped and a cheque is cut for the fuel, less the commission.  I have seen Shell trucks filling tanks at non-Shell independant stations.  Just a theory I have."
250650,Sandbag,2008-09-17 23:38:00,533,"People in Venezuela are not paying world prices for the oil and gas that comes out of their ground. So why are we paying world prices for Canadian fuels. That is the bigger question. Why a gas station charges this or that price is simply price fixing to max profits. Oil company, investors and the tax man all win. We get screwed. The bigger screw is the one all us Canadians get shafted with when we sell all our resources away and pay triple, or more, to buy it back. All the while, the boys on Wall St and Bay St. laugh while they make their puppets dance in Ottawa. Why do you think the main political parties have leaders that look pretty, but lack the necessary backbone to face real issues.  That's my rant  The price of gas in Venezuela is subsidized by their government.  Cheers  Craig"
250651,Billy Bob,2008-09-17 23:38:00,5865,What a dream business to have.......... A distant threat MAY be happing thousands of miles away that may never happen and you can immediately raise your prices without any ill effects to your business.  Pretty much seems like a monopoly to me.  Bob
250665,Wild,2008-09-18 00:09:00,704,Right now the big three producers in Canada have a monopoly and have decided to work together for their own benefit. If you notice the profit margin has increased significantly and they want to keep it high. That is the real reason why pricing has now become standardized. Why are traders selling off oil & gas now? They have to cover their margins due to the market crash.

250424,Rattletrap2,2008-09-17 03:44:00,1652,"Clamp-it, We do understand your very rational approach to all of this, but who said we were talking about rational people or processes? LOL  I try to buy the majority of my gas from a small independent station on my way to and from work. I do this because he always charges a cent or two less than the others around him. Since i am in there on a regular basis, we always discuss the prices while my credit card purchase goes through.  On many occasions, he has shown me the paperwork that he receives from his fuel supplier (Sunoco) that gives him what price he will pay for the gas sold each day. This price sheet is for a month in advance and details each day of the week or month. For instance, he showed me that his cost would go down 2.7 cents per liter plus GST at midnight tonight.  So, he receives his regular fillings from the tanker to keep his underground tanks full, but the price he will pay for the actual liters sold on a given day will cost him a pre-determined amount per liter. It has nothing to do with the price of a barrel of crude or the hurricanes in the south. It is all a game that they are forced to play. He decides how many pennies per liter he wants to make. He always stays slightly lower than his neighbouring stations and his volume is always higher for a given day.  The profit for the station is only a couple of cents per liter.  Another station I go to for boat gas up north told me that their volume is very low for any given day. They are on a lesser travelled road and only have so much traffic to deal with. She told me that if even one customer drives off without paying for their gas, that their entire profit for the day is lost. I would think She is telling the truth. They have to operate a store as well to pay their bills.  I also used to service Petro Canada stations for a few years. Their Management told me that the profit to the station from gasoline sales was peanuts. The real profits come from their car washes first, and then their convenience store sales second."
250427,John Bacon,2008-09-17 04:16:00,3277,  What happens when the gas drops in price?  Would he be expected to continue to maintain the higher price because he bought it at the higher price?  What if a gas station across the street just filled up with the new cheaper gas and was passing the savings on to the customers?  He would either have to sell his expensive gas at a discount (possibly at a loss) or close his station until the price rose again.  Nobody is going to buy his gas if he is charging more than the guy across the street.  If you were an owner who had filled up on day one at 50 cents a litre while the station across the street had filled up on day two at 55 cents a litre.  Suppose that it is now day three and gas is selling for 60 cents a litre.  Would you price your gas 5 cents a litre below the station across the street knowing that you will run out of gas and have to re-fill at 60 cents a litre and then have to choose between selling at a loss or pricing your gas 5 cents a litre more than the station across the street.  How much gas do you think you would sell if your price was 5 cents a litre more than the station across the street?  What do you if the price is back down to 50 cents on day four and you have a full tank of 60 cent a litre gas that you bought on day three?  In summary; no I do not think that it would stand to reason that they could lock their price in because they were luck enough to have filled up before the price increase.
250472,fishinggeek,2008-09-17 13:37:00,325,"Here's my take on it.  Gas stations are often independently owned, and there are many of them, so it is a highly competitive market.  If one station owner decided to lock in the price at the level they paid for it, in other words, until the tank runs dry, the station owner absorbs all the short-term price risk.  Now this wouldn't be a problem if every single gas station did this, but if only one out of many would adjust their prices down by just a bit whenever the gas spot price lowers, then we have an arbitrage situation because customers can get the same gas for a lower cost.  This gas station owner would reap all the profits, so others would follow suit and stop locking in prices.  The ones that don't over time will not survive because of the high level of competition.  This is the reason why the suppliers in highly competitive markets must be ""price takers""."
250498,Stoty,2008-09-17 14:59:00,2910,"Basically, its just a bunch of Bull.  Two words sum it all up..... Supply & Demand.  The gas companies know we HAVE to have gas, therefore can charge $1.38/L and we will pay it. Heck, they can charge $2.00/L and we are still going to pay that. Until a whole bunch of people take a stand and don't buy guys for a while, nothing will change.  I just dont know how certain people can sleep at night knowing they are bending everyone in Canada over each time we go to the pumps. How can you be alright with charging people the same price per litre today, when a barrel is worth $91, as you did a few weeks back when it was $140ish a barrel? Its obvious that its gouging....but no one is doing a darn thing about it."
250503,Guest gbfisher,2008-09-17 15:15:00,0,Buy a Gas Station and find out...... Don't worry though. It will go back up. They buy gas at different times each month. Depending on what they get charged upon delivery. They set their price. If it goes down. They lose. Up they make. Its rather simple really. If you could make more money off of something that everyone needs. Wouldn't you make it? OR would you give everyone a break.........
250507,Stoty,2008-09-17 15:25:00,2910,"There a big difference between making ""more money"" and ""bending people over""."
250508,keram,2008-09-17 15:42:00,585,I do not see it.
250511,Stoty,2008-09-17 15:55:00,2910,"How can you not see it???  How can they charge $1.29/L when a barrel is worth $140ish a few weeks ago....YET... still sell it today with a barrel being worth $91ish. Explain how thats not ""bending people over"" and taking advantage of ""Supply & Demand""??"
250515,ozaibak1,2008-09-17 16:05:00,401, Exactly. The price of the gas and oil is not actually dictated by the 'free market.' The reason the prices fluctuate so much is people are manipulating them. The dictators dictate the price. Its quite simple.
250532,Canuck2fan,2008-09-17 16:58:00,1444," They could do that but then the millions of rich little blood sucking speculators wouldn't be able to make an extra profit. The excuse is that since it is a commodity it is OK to pillage customers at EVERY opportunity. Funny though pork bellies are a commodity too and I don't see someone in a supermarket running about madly with a pricing gun everytime the price changes for them in Chicago at the Merchantile Exchange.  I am starting to see the very real possibility that in the not too distant future a blissful time for us customers where these speculators, oil execs and toady politicans who allow this sort of thing to go unquestioned are tried for and convicted of crimes against humanity LOL I can dream can't I?"
250610,Billy Bob,2008-09-17 22:17:00,5865,There are THREE things we all need to live.  1) FOOD  2) WATER  3) GASOLINE (in today's modern world)  Now here's a question nobody what's to address.......... Why are they still selling gas for example $3.99/9 per gallon. Didn't this outlive itself when gasoline started to sell for over $2 per gallon ? ? ?  (Please forgive the US denominations)
