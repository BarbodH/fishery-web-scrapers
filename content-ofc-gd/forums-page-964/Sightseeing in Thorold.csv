For those of you not familiar with Thorold, the town is surrounded by a series of ponds, channels and canals known as L. Gibson. Boating is not allowed so shoreline  fishing is all you can do. Wading is also not allowed  There is far more shoreline than you can hope to cover in a day. The back areas are beautiful with an abundance of wildlife just steps from town. There are also a couple of hiking trails following some of the shoreline. As for the fishing, today was not a banner day. The bite was off. I said I brought 3 rods: one for spinerbaits-useless. One for worms, and one for tubes.  Lot of trial and error before connecting, but today's ticket was small baits. 4"" carolina rigged worms and 2"" tubes. There were no big fish caught. 6 dink bass in all      But look at what else was hitting my plastics. This fella was on a 2"" tube    The perch was big fish of the day at 11 1/2"" on the 4"" worm. The panfish were hungrier than the bass thats for sure. In all, no skunk, lots of fresh air, exercise and peace. Just gotta love it"
