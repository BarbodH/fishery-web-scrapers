250972,fishdawg,2008-09-18 21:16:00,912,a couple mature lake O salmon salmon each season is no worse for you then a pack of smokes IMO but yes the smaller ones 2-5 lbs are the best
250984,camillj,2008-09-18 21:41:00,1988,Been eating L.O. salmon and trout since I was a kid (and thats a long time ago)... I have found them both tasty and healthy  ...in fact  I would say ... the salmonids are a good barometer of healthy waters ... if they look or act sick dont eat them ... but if they look and act  healthy ... well you're probably good to go ... but then .... I was a smoker for 25 years so... your results may vary
250993,Beats,2008-09-18 22:04:00,543,"    Oh man, that made me laugh."
251090,Canuck,2008-09-19 03:05:00,491,"Eat it.  I agree on the planking.  Here is a good recipe that takes the alewife taste out. Marinate clean filets (skin taken off) in a mixture of a lot of maple syrup and a little lemon juice and some salt.  (only for a few hours).  Take the fish out and boil up the marinade and reduce until its as thick as the original maple syrup was, add some butter salt and a bit of pepper. Then plank on a soaked cedar board in the BBQ and baste the salmon on the plank with the syrup while it cooks.  You will love it!"
250629,chickenhawk,2008-09-17 22:53:00,612,"Here's the thing, my step mom went on a fishing charter yesterday out on Lake Ontario......and she ended up catching a big chinny pure silver and everyone else caught trout.....well seeing as she LOVES salmon she wanted to keep it.....now heres my question......I myself don't eat the fish I catch out of Lake Ontario especially the salmon....should she eat this thing? or should I get rid of it? What do you guys think?  Hawk"
250634,uglyfish,2008-09-17 23:02:00,981,"its harmless. i;ve eaten many and so do many ppl i know. i personally prefer the smaller fish, as with most species i decide to invite for dinner. but it won;t hurt her. my buddy smokes the big ones, they come out great!"
250637,Terry,2008-09-17 23:10:00,14456,well you could but I wouldn't here is the fish eating guide   http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/envision/guide/  check it out
250638,jediangler,2008-09-17 23:12:00,1923,I've caught 5 lake Ontario salmon and two of them were horribly deformed. I wouldn't eat them. 
250646,Billy Bob,2008-09-17 23:33:00,5865,"Been eating them for over 20 years without any ill effects.  Answer yourself this question.  How safe is the BEEF or PORK you eat ? ? ?  Of course you will think GOOD because they both have lobbiest that want you to think that. HOWEVER, everyday people are suffering and being hospitalized from ill effects of eating red meat. But you don't have WARING labels on those products do you ? ? ?  WHY ! ! !  I will take any salmon, trout, perch or walleye from Lake Ontario or Lake Erie that anyone thinks is unsafe to consume.  Now think again,  where are the salmon caught that are being sold world wide........... It's anyone's guess most times.  ANY fish or other foods now possess continents because of our environment these days........  many of our crops are watered with Great Lakes water........... need I continue ... :<("
250661,silveradosheriff,2008-09-17 23:56:00,1025,"If you focus on shakers, you will be fine."
250664,Beats,2008-09-18 00:07:00,543,"Everything in moderation.  I mean, look at the numbers of ppl out there catching and eating fish from any body of water.  If the fish looks good and the fillets look ok then I would say a single fish/meal wouldn't do any harm.   But if you strongly feel you shouldn't eat it, then by all means don't."
250669,Wild,2008-09-18 00:31:00,704,"It all depends on an individual's risk factor and the specific chemical cocktail present. Keep in mind that toxins can be stored in our own bodies for years and carcinogens other nasties can be  absorbed from a variety of sources from air pollution, that water you drink, plastics, processed food, that bottle of pop, even the shampoo you use even that Lake O shower:0 Would I partake in a LO dinner? No not really and I cannot recommend it ether."
250679,bbog,2008-09-18 00:50:00,665,"You didn't say what size this fish was - but anything in moderation ""should"" be ok. Consult the guide (Terry provided the link).  I have a few fillets in my freezer right now but like some others have said prefer the smaller ones."
250680,bbog,2008-09-18 00:50:00,665,Trust it so much I posted twice
250741,CLofchik,2008-09-18 03:58:00,854," Heh, that's an accident from the hatchery when it was just a little guy.........now the 20lb hen I caught with two mouths and deformed eggs, that's another story.....  Okay, have you ever eaten at MacDonald's?  Lake O salmon are safer. Now the flavour is a totally different topic.......alewife fed fish don't taste that great.  White, oily, greasy fillets.  The smaller guys are still targetting invertebrates, and have nice pink tasty meat.  But the big alewife stuffed kings......not so great.  Have you ever planked fish on the bbq?  Smoking them is the best, gets all the grease out, but planked Lake O salmon isn't bad. However you cook it, lose most of the belly and only cook the thick back part.  Most of the fillet below the lateral line is stored fat for their run up the tribs, not so great.   And any wild caught fish beats whatever processed garbage you'd otherwise eat."
250766,blaque,2008-09-18 10:12:00,2419,......Not as far as i can throw em'
250772,rhare,2008-09-18 10:42:00,387,    That is not actually true. The pictured fish has WHIRLING DISEASE.   Whirling disease is a parasite that causes the deformed apperence of the fish. It can in some cases kill the fish. Most often the fish are stocked. I have caught Rainbows in Gbay with it. lots more info on the net.   Ryan
250780,Randy,2008-09-18 11:24:00,115,"I'd agree with what Terry said, follow the MOE guide for eating sportfish. Afterall, this is the only scientific information available that deals with the subject."
250790,BITEME,2008-09-18 12:00:00,1969,I would'nt make a career out of it ...but its all good smaller ones are much better
250861,ozaibak1,2008-09-18 15:42:00,401,"Don't eat them too often and you'll be fine. Having a Lake O salmon once in a blue moon is not risky at all, or not as risky as you'd think."
250864,Stoty,2008-09-18 15:46:00,2910,considering everything that has happened recently............(meat) I would think its almost safer to eat then a sub!
250871,xrap,2008-09-18 16:01:00,683,"I heard people make milkshakes from gobies, so salmon yeah i guess there safe"
250876,bukee,2008-09-18 16:30:00,58,"Nothing wrong with eating that fish.  Just make sure you lose the belly fat.  Lake  O salmon are much safer that 90% of the fish we buy.  You wouldn't believe how much crap is in Tuna, swordfish, etc.  Enjoy that Lake O salmon with your mom and feel good about it."
250883,jwl,2008-09-18 16:53:00,1056,"I just think somewhere is an evil plot to kill off the guys  , all the guidlines always say that women in child-bearing years and children should not eat the fish"
250886,BillM,2008-09-18 16:57:00,17367,I couldn't imagine eating a fish out of a lake that when I was young my parents forbid me to even step foot in
250887,Mr. Follow,2008-09-18 17:01:00,34,I got a nioce 14 lber a couple years ago and gave it to my parents they are still alive today with no ill efects. Like the guys say I don't think I would have kept it if it was much bigger but it was a great meal for my folks. Enjoy it with your Mom
250930,huey graphite,2008-09-18 18:51:00,362,  Does he know you speak of him in this manner    I would only trust them as far as you can throw them
250933,chickenhawk,2008-09-18 18:58:00,612,Well.....I can assure you that I am not going to eat it cuz I still don't trust Lake O and I really do not like salmon at all.....but my step mom says she is going to eat it and it is cut into steaks....so hopefully thats mainly the back part of the fish.....  Hawk
250968,mattyk,2008-09-18 20:55:00,2110,"No,i would not eat any fish from Lake Ontario."
