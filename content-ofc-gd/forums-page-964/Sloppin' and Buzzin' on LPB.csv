Nothing big, Sleded got the biggest at about 1.5 - 2lbs but we held them close enough to the camera that they looked decent... lol  First two were caught on scum frogs in the heavy slop near St Williams and the last two were caught on the weedbeds near Port Rowan, on buzzbaits. I think we caught a dozen in total and took pics randomly.  Only other thing of interest is I hooked a nice rock bass and a nice pike (possibly musky, more likely pike) came out of the depths and chased it all the way to the boat before taking off.  The fish weren't big and it sure wasn't easy, but anytime you get into topwater bass it's a great day on the water!          Thanks for coming out Sleded, its been way too long!"
