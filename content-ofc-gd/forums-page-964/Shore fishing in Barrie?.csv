250593,JDMITR,2008-09-17 21:04:00,12,Hi I'm a brand new member here and love the information I have gathered already.  Just out of curiosity does anyone know of any good places to shore fish in Barrie or the surrounding area?  I've read some posts about Little Lake and the government docks.  Are you able to shore fish at Little Lake?  Thanks in advance!
250689,Rizzo,2008-09-18 01:09:00,4754,I'm not sure about shore fishing at little lake as I've only ever ice fished there but I believe its pretty shallow close to shore. Won't be long now before people will be at the Barrie Marina filling garbage bags full of 7 inch perch though
250695,jdmls,2008-09-18 01:18:00,575,"little lake shore fishing, nope... Is your ITR right hand drive, or did you just buy a front clip from Japan Auto, LOL !!! Just kidding around , welcome to the board ....my JDMLS intetgra was one of my first cars..Ahh memories.. I used the name for all the car message boards and it sorta stuck as my online name ."
250700,Fisherman,2008-09-18 01:29:00,7201,"You can shore fish down at the bottom of Bayfield St, usually someone fishing there or at the little park area at the Tiffin St launch.  Once the boats are out of the Barrie Marina, the hordes decend on the docks."
250730,Cudz,2008-09-18 03:15:00,2652,Shore fish the dock at the end of dock road.  There are thousands of bass there (rock bass lol).  You will catch loads.
250745,Governator,2008-09-18 04:00:00,879,  By far the best spot from the shore in Barrie.  All panfish but loads of action.  Sad part is they are building a brand new subdivision off that road and soon it'll have more pressure than it can handle.
250747,Cudz,2008-09-18 04:06:00,2652,True. You can also throw out from the rocks at Tyndale park.  Lots of perch. You can also fish the North side of the lake (good when the wind is from the North).  Find a park on kempenfelt drive.  Park there and walk through the park down the steep bank and look for a waterski slalom course.  Lots of fish.  Use a float and about 4ft of line below.
250897,JDMITR,2008-09-18 17:20:00,12,"Thank you everyone for all your input!!  Does anyone know if Balsam Lake is any good for shore fishing!? We are not looking to catch a monster of the shore but decent 1-2 lbs fish.  JDMLS I don't have the car anymore, but I had a '97 with the front clip.  From my knowledge I believe we were one of the first to have the front clip in Ontario. *I miss that car!*"
