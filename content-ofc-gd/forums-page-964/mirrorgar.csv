But it was alot smarter back then. So I guess when they get older they get...     ok ok, so the water color is differnet. I was fishing two different places but not the same day of course.  I'm really happy about the mirror. Its been how long...5+ yrs since I started carp fishing and never landed or had one on.  dsn"
