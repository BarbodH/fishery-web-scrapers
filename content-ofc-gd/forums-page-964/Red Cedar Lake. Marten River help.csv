250655,Magnaflux,2008-09-17 23:45:00,1,I will be at fishing Red Cedar Lake in the beginning of Oct. Can someone give me some tips for Walleye and Pike? Thanks...
250659,Beats,2008-09-17 23:56:00,543,I was there a couple years back and didn't have much success except for pike and the odd bass.  Do a search and see what comes up.  I didn't hook into any pickerel up there but my friend did and they were all caught just drifting worms on jigheads through saddles between the mainland and islands at dusk.
