I have gone back through the search engine for info posted by OFC'rs to see what was up...and for the most part it seemed a difficult fish. I've also researched the navionics topo's and Adventure Maps edition of the waters and are just searching out for a little more info on locations N-S-E or West. PM me if you choose......all info will be appreciated.. Thanks Kindly... BnB"
250615,Ron,2008-09-17 22:23:00,1683,What species are you targeting? I might be able to help you some what...
250657,purekgw,2008-09-17 23:50:00,585,"stoney lake has ALOT of largies  quite a few musky but last time we where up only got two walleye that might have been just bad luck we usually do good and if u dont know the lake or dont have a good Gps i wouldnt go ripping around in areas you dont know to well, lots of large rock points most are marked"
250719,brickNblock,2008-09-18 02:45:00,598,"Ron..hey there Bud...long time no see around these parts..perhaps its only me. I wont be targeting musky this weekend... Bass/Walleye only The cabin we have is located on the extreme south end just east of McCrackens landing...actualley..GilchristBay. Ive courses plotted to the south from there going south through Fairylake both east and west but it looks like the south end will be the most productive from the info I have. I was also thinking about ging north towards Burleigh Falls....there are pools around the basin where the falls sorta chill out.  Pure... I do have a finder combo..the L-522iGPS. Ive been looking and its not called stoney for nothing...seems more islands or sunken islands. You can be sure there wont be too many times we'll have 'er wide open. But, Thanks for the heads up."
250726,Stoty,2008-09-18 03:05:00,2910,The big Stoney Lake Combo tournament is on this weekend! Make sure you get out there EARLY if you want decent spots.
