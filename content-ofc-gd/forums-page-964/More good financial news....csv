250395,danc,2008-09-17 01:47:00,4677,You'll still be covered Tom. That's not the problem. Just continue watching your pension money disappear into thin air tomorrow...
250396,Casey123,2008-09-17 01:49:00,461,I could use an extra $85 Billion.
250399,Stoty,2008-09-17 02:02:00,2910,Do you work for a gasoline company?  
250401,lookinforwalleye,2008-09-17 02:05:00,4399,"Must be nice to be able print up a few billion, it will catch up with them eventually."
250405,tjsa,2008-09-17 02:14:00,1578," Yeah, I know I am still covered. Fortunately they are not my pension provider."
250410,danc,2008-09-17 02:38:00,4677, Yikes Tom. Do some reading my friend. We are all at risk here. The AIG takeover is just the latest threat.
250440,bucktail,2008-09-17 11:52:00,1857,"Dan is right. Better to bite the bullet now then erode this system and have your kids pay for it. Peoplle have to live within there means, businesses to. Hey I am worst offender of that but this is a reminder!"

250506,OhioFisherman,2008-09-17 15:24:00,6623,"Parker Bros. announces it will sell it`s monopoly games with real US money, debt is making the dollar worth about the same as the play money.  If you spend? sooner or late you have to pay? LMAO, the finest financial minds in the world? Just ask them!"
250600,TennesseeGuy,2008-09-17 21:34:00,957,"AIG has over 1 trillion in assets.  AIG pays aproximately $82 million in claims each day.  Our federal government will receive a 79.9 percent equity interest in AIG.  That scares me the most.  Look how our government handled Fannie and Freddie the past 2 + decades.  Hopefully Warren Buffet will see this as a buying opportunity and seek control.  He could make it work.  Eliot Spitzer chased off Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg in charges about nothing.  Hank had probably the best chance of anybody to keep AIG above water.   He offered his help again and was turned away."
