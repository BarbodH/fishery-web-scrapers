I wouldn't mind catching a few walleyes for dinner one night and any help you can provide would be great.  Also, are the muskie deep or shallow?  colours?  Any help would be fantastic.  Thanks,  Todd"

250430,Spiel,2008-09-17 09:53:00,9065,  ....You could just stop in at the Lakair Lodge docks and show me/us in person. There will be about 20 or so of us from this board there on the weekend.   You might even snag a few tips from some of the regulars to the west arm.
250523,Toddyc20,2008-09-17 16:36:00,141," This would be a good idea.  Now i really hope i can catch something worth showing off.  Anybody hear how the fishing has been up there this week?  I was in the south bay of nipissing last week and fishing was tough, very tough.  Hopefully we all catch a lot of fish and have a great time."
