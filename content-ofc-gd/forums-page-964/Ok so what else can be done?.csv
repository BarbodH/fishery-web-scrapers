They also said I may not get a replacement. Do they really test the rod for age, place of breakage, and so on? Does anyone know a short-cut through the bushes with this one?"
250239,bassjnkie,2008-09-16 17:38:00,1101,"They don't do all that testing. And you don't have to do all that work. Angling specialties or Aikemens sporting goods will send it for you and you get an equal replacment. Just a heads up, the rod won't be returned quickly.  aikmans sports linklink  http://www.profilecanada.com/companydetail..._Mississauga_ON   Angling specialties link  http://canada411.yellowpages.ca/bus/Ontari...l?adid=00562850  Hope this helps.  Daniel"

250368,Rizzo,2008-09-17 01:03:00,4754, does this matter?
250413,urbanangler1990,2008-09-17 02:54:00,933," they may not return if it doesnt past the ""test"" i guess  but as Dan has put it they dont check, so i have learned something knew, that is if your right Dan, haha,  i appreciate your comment"
250414,urbanangler1990,2008-09-17 02:56:00,933,"  in this kind of society it very much is important, as the ways of making good money or money to at least make it through the month thin, we have to work that much harder for what we have, sadly money talks..."
250415,urbanangler1990,2008-09-17 02:57:00,933," Thank you, i didnt know about this as I have never tried to replace a rod through a store other then BPS"
250425,kemper,2008-09-17 03:48:00,2232,"if all  else fails they can be repaired, just like a busted hockey stick... but why not try to get a new one!"
250562,POLLIWOGG,2008-09-17 18:38:00,835,"I sent them half a rigger stick years ago, I think I told them I stepped on it or something like that and asked to be billed for the replacement as I was at fault. They sent me a new half at no charge, WoO HOO .  But I think they have changed ownership since then so they might not be so generous.  Browning was another that was very good to me."
250566,bassjnkie,2008-09-17 18:50:00,1101,"Aikems is not a store they do warranty work for most companies. If you are still stuck send it yourself, buy a tube, tape it up and send it. Pay the shipping there and back. Done, you will have it by Chrismas.  Daniel"

250699,jdmls,2008-09-18 01:25:00,575,"LOL , hey bud...funny as how both the rod's we traded each other, broke...I returned mine for an over the counter replacement at KTL in missisauga...For fenwick I am almost positive that you can bring the rod in to Aikmans and they will give you a replacement right there and then..I have had 2 buddies go their with broken rods, and they don't ask any questions , they even give you a couple options if your rod is no longer available..."
250725,GoneFishin,2008-09-18 03:01:00,349,I got realy desparate and tried to glue a fenwick back together after I slammed a door on it. They sent me a new one lol. Dont expect to be using it this season though. Will probably get it back in time for spring.
250739,CLofchik,2008-09-18 03:43:00,854,"Isn't there a Fenwick distributor in Mississauga? They do alot of the Ontario warranty work, you can just walk in with a broken rod and walk out with a new one?  Darn, forget where the place is, it's been that long since I've owned a Fenwick."
