250943,bigugli,2008-09-18 19:40:00,6138,Thank you for the listen   I've not heard that tune in many a year.   Used to get the squid right in the harbours in N.S. You grab a rod and a couple of squid jigs and head for the pier from late afternoon til dark. Even the small squid puts up a heckuva fight.
