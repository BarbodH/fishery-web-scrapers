164814,Casey123,2008-02-27 00:20:00,461,Just wondering where everyone is planning on spending their first soft water fish day of the year?  Whenever it gets here.  We usually waarm up on some Crappies in the advance of the Last Saturday in April.  This year I will be staying as far away from Algonquin Park as possible.  You can read a previous post and it will explain why.

165155,cranks bait,2008-02-27 18:23:00,721,I got out in the boat in January with no luck.  Hopefully the ice will go away here before the end of March so I can get some pike fishing in.
