Heres a pic of one of the lakers that I landed that was easy double digits in weight(size 11 snow boot as reference to size), sorry for bad pic but I was solo and wanted to send him back down the hole ASAP. All fish were caught in 77' off Long shoal using a small half half williams spoon. Ice conditions were great for sleds, ATVs and I did see a bunch of trucks out today.  Tight lines, RF "

165372,waterwolf,2008-02-28 01:27:00,556,"nice thick , healthy ,  fish. solo pic's never really do the fish [ or fisherman ] justice. lol.  my best pike was photo'd solo. 39 inches, looked about 5lbs. flat on the ice next to the rod and reel.  what a joke .  feel your pain.  a guy about 1\3 amile away for a good pic wasn't worth losin' a great fish .  thanks for the report . tight lines ."
