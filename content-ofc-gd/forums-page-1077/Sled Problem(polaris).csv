164079,buckster,2008-02-25 01:47:00,530,"I have a 99 indy spot touring 440   Seems like for some reason this season when the sled is cold it takes me many a pulls to get it started.  Tried new plugs and same deal.  If its sits for 6-7 hours outside my hut, same deal plenty -o- pulls.  checked the choke cables they seemed to be ok.   Any ideas?  Maybe a fuel problem?"
164082,Sinker,2008-02-25 01:51:00,8692,Are you sure the choke is working?
164088,buckster,2008-02-25 01:56:00,530,i checking the cable on one carb and it seemed like it worked.  When i put the choke on it came all the way up......... but i didnt check the other carb to be honest with u
164091,Sinker,2008-02-25 02:00:00,8692,"Sure sounds like a choke issue to me.....I""m no mechanic though....just an educated guess.  Does it run OK once you get it started?"
164093,buckster,2008-02-25 02:02:00,530,ya seems ok not to sure if it sounds to crisp though but i think im just paranoid
164094,Sinker,2008-02-25 02:03:00,8692,Shoulda got a CAT......
164098,buckster,2008-02-25 02:06:00,530,i towed in my firends cat 2 sundays in a row lol
164120,carll2,2008-02-25 02:44:00,443,my non efi yamaha srx takes 6-7 pulls on a cold morning..its perfectly normal
164121,Sandbag,2008-02-25 02:47:00,533,"I tend to agree with Sinker that it sounds like a choke issue.  I would unscrew the choke cables at the carbs and ensure that the cables, and springs are functioning properly"
164135,buckster,2008-02-25 03:06:00,530,  i wish it were only that many
164142,Bernie,2008-02-25 03:16:00,3190,"Don't work on sleds too often but It seems like a lack of fuel problem cold. Not sure whether this has a choke or a fuel enricher, depends on the type of carburetor. Don't think this would have a choke plate so its likely a stuck valve or plugged ports. If you haven't had the carbs off this year it may be a good idea to take them apart and clean them up anyway. It may save you a burned piston."
164266,ecmilley,2008-02-25 15:15:00,2163,"before you do anything, do a compression test, when they start getting old and wearing out they get progressivley harder to start, if the compressions in spec, due as Bernie suggest's and clean and check carb function"
164337,Hookset,2008-02-25 18:57:00,367,My 1972 Snow Cruiser starts on the 6th 0r 7th pull...shoulda bought a Snow Cruiser...  kidding.  Definitely sounds like a fuel flow issue to me.  Hookset.
164420,Casey123,2008-02-26 00:14:00,461,"I now exactly how to fix this problem.............  A match and a can of gas.  All joking aside, it is def. a fuel problem.  However, on a 8 to 9 year old sled, it is perfectly normal.  I doubt replacing your fuel delivery system is cost effective.  Besides, Think of the extra exercise."
164455,carll2,2008-02-26 01:07:00,443,if you havent done a tune up thid yeasr i would recomment having one done...sometimes a dirty or plugged up jet or needle in the carb will do it
164881,buckster,2008-02-27 01:39:00,530,  20-30 pulls is normal lol........ i might aswell walk.  Sled only has 1100miles
164942,Kerry,2008-02-27 03:57:00,383,My 2004 Panther 570 fan takes up to 6 pulls if I do it by hand.I just had it all rebuilt and it still does the exact same thing even with one size larger jets.Some are just like that. Easy things to check: Choke settings- toggle freeplay 1/16-3/32 or somewhere round there'll get you close. Make sure you are pulling the choke right over to 180 degrees and not just to the first 90 degree notch-that'll definately require a lot of pulls cold. Rubber carb boots not cracked.(between the carbs and airbox.) 1999-I'd want to put a new gas filter on just from age. Air pulse line from crankcase to fuel pump is tight at both ends as well as the gas lines. Air box doesn't have a mouse nest or anything in it. 1100 miles doesn't mean your crank seals may have dried a bit over time.Easy check on the clutch side is to spray Wd40 at the seal behind the clutch while it is running.Any change in RPM and you're looking at seals otherwise you'll lean out the motor for sure.Of course don't get the oil on your belt or clutch.  A little more involved: Carbs cleaned-usually just need to be cleaned and can reuse the gasket.May need new needle and seat.Make sure all the jets are removed and cleaned.The pilot airjet is the smallest one and is the one that affects low speed the most.. Fuel pump might be getting weak from age.Usually a Mikuni kit to rebuild.  Kerry
165178,buckster,2008-02-27 18:54:00,530,wow good stuff thanks Kerry............ I think i solved the problem thanks everyone!!!!
165272,Bernie,2008-02-27 21:31:00,3190, So what was the solution?  Good advice Kerry.
165301,buckster,2008-02-27 22:38:00,530,1) the choke cable setting 2) cleaned and carb and something to do with the float.  Done and done thanks to my old man lol....... i was lost after setting the choke lol
