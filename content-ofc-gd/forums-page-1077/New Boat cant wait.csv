164987,lunkerbasshunter,2008-02-27 12:16:00,2585,wow sweet ride for sure!  I cant believe how much you can save buying a boat across the border!  Cheers!
164990,DanTheMan,2008-02-27 12:21:00,257,Sweet Ride indeed!!!  Congrats Benny!!
164998,Big Cliff,2008-02-27 12:45:00,6899,"Beautiful package, would love to get love to get something similar but it'll have to wait until I win a lottery or something.  BTW if you do hit a reef in 27' of water don't worry about it, worry about what caused you to get down to the reef in the first place LOL."
165003,OhioFisherman,2008-02-27 12:49:00,6623,Nice ride Benny!
165184,icefisherman,2008-02-27 19:02:00,952,"  Benny,  I live west of GTA but up North, your way is my anual trip every summer. Have done it last two summers, no reason to miss it this summer. Temmagami, North Bay and Algonquin - got lots of fish with my old boat and sure hope my new one follows the lead  Should be coming your way late July or first part of August, so PM me some contacts and I'd love to do side by side fishing with you Bud. By the same talking....any time you come down to the big Smoke let me know and we'll check and see how the Salmon is doing in Lake O.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
164623,BENNY,2008-02-26 15:37:00,37,"So I went and picked up my boat in the US and now have it in my drive way. 2003 Lund 1900 ProV SE IFS. 200 Yammy with an 8 hp yammy kicker. Very easy to do and would do it again. Special thanks to Icefisherman,Krisco,eyefish and gerritt for all the questions they helped me out with and to everyone else who helped out in different posts.  I will try and put some pics on if I can get it to work.....   Benny            "
164624,Blue_Axela,2008-02-26 15:44:00,88,Sweet ride!  Congrats!  How much did you pay for the package if you don't mind me asking?
164630,doubleheader,2008-02-26 16:02:00,497,Really a fine looking rig.  A Pro-V will last a lifetime. Congratulations
164634,bucktail,2008-02-26 16:12:00,1857,Thats the exact setup I wantto get!! Great rig man! Was it much of a hassle getting across the border? I hear the trailer is more complicated then the boat to bring over.
164641,Terry,2008-02-26 16:30:00,14456,good looking boat
164645,lew,2008-02-26 16:45:00,12767,"Great looking new ride Benny, congrats on the purchase.  I've always been a fan of the Pro V's"
164647,BENNY,2008-02-26 16:49:00,37," To be honest it was riduculous how easy it was... I feel stupid for looking into it as much as I did. We crossed at Fort Erie and the girl we had wanted to go on her lunch so she rushed through it. She didnt even ask for the TITLES!! or the BIIL OF SALE for the boat. She needed the bill of sale for the trailer to fill out the form 1 but that was it. I could have said I paid 5,000 for the boat they didnt even look at the boat or search it lol. It depends who you get but all you need for sure is the bill of sale for boat and trailer seperatly and also the titles for both as well signed over to you. In and out in 10 min. You pay PST and GST on boat right there at the border and only GST on the trailer, you pay the PST on trailer when you register in in Canada. If you ever have any questions let me know I have er down to a science now lol.  Benny"
