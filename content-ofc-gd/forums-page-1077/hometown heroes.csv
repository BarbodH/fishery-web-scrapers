165493,maybe,2008-02-28 13:28:00,307,"I've got one like yours.  77 with a bad back, and has been practically living at the local art gallery for years.  We're happy he's ""slowed down"" to shovelling snow and building/hauling fixtures around, after his last volunteer career.  When he was 70, it was time to get rid of a massive white pine in his front yard.  The town was looking for big tree donations as material for the bandshell they were building.  The light went on - donate the tree, they'll cut it down and haul it away for free.  Normally, that'd be the end of it, but something happens when retired builders smell sawdust.  Next thing we know, Dad's followed the tree to the construction site, and at 70 is volunteering more hours than the paid builder is putting in.  Stumbled onto  Dad wound up with a hernia from hauling cedar shingles up onto the roof, but it barely registered.  Got it fixed after the project ended, and is back to running 100mph as usual.  Last time I dropped into the gallery, I met several of the committee members.  They all gushed at length about how they didn't know what the gallery would do without Dad.  He just beamed.  It was a wonderful thing to see.  Sounds like your father's found himself the same kind of niche mine has.  If you can keep yours from getting a hernia, you're golden."
