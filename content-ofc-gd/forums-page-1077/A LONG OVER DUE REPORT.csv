164801,Tarzan's Jane,2008-02-26 23:47:00,1183,"You are very selfless to see what truly does matter.  Thankfully for you, your wife didn't give up.  We all need ""me time"", and as long as there is a healthy balance, I believe all will remain well with everyone in the family. Thanks for sharing that."
164823,canadian_copper,2008-02-27 00:29:00,925,TX ALL.  SORRY FOR THE DOUBLE POST. CAN AN ADMIN DELETE THAT FOR ME.   TY
164831,irishfield,2008-02-27 00:35:00,26272,Now if Scott's wife would just take away his caps lock privileges life would be swell !  Some nice fish there fella.!
164839,taper,2008-02-27 00:53:00,611,Nice report. Glad to hear from you again.
164841,danbo,2008-02-27 00:55:00,2646,Atta boy!
164904,ccmtcanada,2008-02-27 02:16:00,7971,"Way to go Scott!  Both on the fish and the life realization.  You are right...fishing can be addictive and relationship destroying if taken to the extreme.  It sounds like you are a much happier man...keeping a balance in life is what it's all about.  That being said, I still want to fish with you in the spring...LOL."
164911,spoonman,2008-02-27 02:22:00,103,Copper thought you fell off the earth. Nice going bud Cheers Al
164918,danc,2008-02-27 02:58:00,4677,Very touching post CC. I always wondered where you found all that time to go fishing. Thanks for putting it into perspective for the rest of us.  And an excellent report. Great photos. Thanks for sharing..
164926,johnnyb,2008-02-27 03:27:00,3413,"Happy wife, happy life -- way to go man   And nice fish too!!"
164935,Gawel,2008-02-27 03:45:00,27,Nice pictures.  Good advice in your post.  Sometimes guilty of it myself too.
164983,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-02-27 12:03:00,1362,Great report....I think we're all a bit guilty when it comes to priorities and fishing!! I'm headin' up North for trout on Friday with a bunch of lads I haven't seen for years!!  It was my wife that kept insisting that I go and have some fun with old friends....I plan on coming home early Sunday instead of Monday to surprise her (it's her B'day) and pamper her for the day!!!
164986,b2kptbo,2008-02-27 12:15:00,1505,Good stuff Scott...
165005,OhioFisherman,2008-02-27 12:55:00,6623,GREAT PICTURES AND REPORT CC!
165007,Marko,2008-02-27 12:56:00,854,I thought something had happened to you since i havent seeen any posts from you this winter. I remember last year every 2 days there would be a report written in caps and knew it was you.  Good to see you are still alive and still catching fish and being a father and a husband at the same time.  Nice fish by the way.
165202,Douger,2008-02-27 19:27:00,116,"nice report scott!  i have an 8 month old and missed the fall season entirely, but i have no regrets b/c i was doing what had to be done. family first!!  you have to make deposits into the relationship account before you can withdraw,  and if the balance is zero...  take care, and keep up the great work."
165286,blaque,2008-02-27 22:07:00,2419,"Youve carved a niche with your CAPS LOCK lol.....so i remember alot of your posts as well,  from here and other boards. And seem to remember a ""lil C"" in alot of them. You can have your cake and eat it too. Nothing wrong with takin the fam along with you to share in what your passionate about. Get a chromer on the end of that float rod for the wifey and she should be in for good too. Although it might put you in the poor house tryin to equip all 3 with steelhead gear lol."
