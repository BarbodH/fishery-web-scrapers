161883,boomer74,2008-02-19 06:05:00,2,Can any body tell me where I can find a shop or somebody to fix my fishing rod? The top section broke about a foot from the tip.

161989,bassjnkie,2008-02-19 16:32:00,1101,Angling Specialties on HWY 7
162086,Spiel,2008-02-19 20:22:00,9065,"....A foot from the tip, I'd try and get it replaced or buy a new one. A foot off any rod is not repairable and using it a foot shorter than it's origional length is not desirable nor recommended."
162126,irishfield,2008-02-19 21:56:00,26272,Somehow I tend to agree with Spiel for some reason...can't quite put my finger on it.. but i do! lol  That first foot is the sensation trigger for you.. fishin them finicky pickeral fishes.
