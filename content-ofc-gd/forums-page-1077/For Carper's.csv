I was there picking up a few things from their $1.00 sale and noticed the corn on sale so I stocked up for the summer months to come.  I would use maize but I have no ride and no place to store and ferment such experimental toxic projects like that.  dsn"
165293,Gawel,2008-02-27 22:22:00,27,Thanks for the heads up.  At that price I can buy two cans for each outing so that I don't have to munch on my fishing corn when waiting for the fish to bite.
165326,waterwolf,2008-02-27 23:41:00,556,i'm thinking 'bout goin' out sunday. is corn not considered decent winter fare for hungry carp?
165330,Photoz,2008-02-27 23:46:00,792,I buy a couple 40 kilo bags up in Queensville for $8.00 a bag. I use the equivalent of about 15 cans just to chum with each trip!
165379,shane,2008-02-28 01:38:00,652,I get the cheapest cans of corn niblets I can find at the cheapest discount stores.  Two or three for a buck. They are usually great big kernels in some kind of corny slime.  I wouldn't dare eat the stuff but it makes excellent carp bait.
