His vehicle was a little different than the pick-ups I am used to seeing.  This one was a rap video style Chevy SUV which was no big deal. This SUV had ""CANINE"" written on the back.  Now I have never seen this before nor have I come across a CO with dogs in the field before.  Anyone one even experience CO's using dogs when patrolling?  Are they used for special investigations??  Any info would be great.  Also, very recently in a parking lot in almost the same area, I believe it was Walmart, I also saw a Fisheries Enforcement vehicle.  This one wasn't an MNR vehicle, it was a federal officers vehicle.  Any information on this?  Just curious what the federal enforcement officer would be enforcing compared to what an MNR CO would be enforcing.  Either way, its good to see both vehicles."

Always with them before Lake Trout season opens and the dog can tell the difference between a whitie and a laker buried in the snow.... 100's of feet from where you're fishin!

The DFO guys deal a lot more with habitat and making sure Federal regulations are followed. I'm not saying that the CO's don't enforce federal regs, i'm saying that there are some that fall specifically under the DFO.  -R-"

In my case none were to be found..... there was a CO... and a   VERY VERY PRETTY  25 or so year old Handler  she had a black lab.... his name was Cody.  The kids had a blast with Cody......he went on to find some frozen perch under 2"" of ice."
