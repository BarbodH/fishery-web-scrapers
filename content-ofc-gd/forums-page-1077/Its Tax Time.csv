165001,Randy,2008-02-27 12:48:00,115,I was wondering if anyone has used  Studio Tax to prepare that personal income tax? Its free.

165152,bbog,2008-02-27 18:20:00,665,Based on your question I downloaded and gave StudioTax a shot. Provided the same results as UFile.  Looks like a decent product at the right price.
