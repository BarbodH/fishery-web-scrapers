165230,TJQ,2008-02-27 20:08:00,7806,"I know.. I know... Were so darn busy..  its crazy... with the decline in US tourism, we are becoming a very attractive, low cost solution and alternative to higher priced print advertising and sport shows.  It has occurred to me that as stupid as this sounds, a bad year for tourism is actually good for business for us.  Also I'm working on some larger advertisers as well.  I will be at the Sportsmans Show all day Saturday the 15th though and will be available to sign autograph's... lol  we should try to put together a  meet, eat and greet somewhere that nite!!"
