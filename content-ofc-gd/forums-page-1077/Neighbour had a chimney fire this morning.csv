Sorry I don't have pics of all the vehicles(two trucks and seven volunteer vehicles)as I never even thought of a picture,just wanted to make sure our neighbours were OK.  Kerry"

I have been burning wood every year since 1990 in my wood burner, only problem I had was when I tried to go two years without cleaning, yellow jackets had built a nest in the chimney. With that and the creosote build up it blocked it and smoke started coming into the house.  Care is needed, my neighbors had a chimney fire and it ruined the tile chimney liner, they had to get a stainless liner. I like to get at least two years wood at a time, plenty of room to store it though for me. Well seasoned burns cleaner."

165732,Kerry,2008-02-29 00:06:00,383,"Fortunately theirs is only about three years old,so it's all lined stainless.I think they didn't get nearly as much hardwood mixed in as they probably should have.The chimney sweep came in this afternoon and they are OK to burn.I think they will be a little more wary from here on as will I seeing as it's along my driveway side.
