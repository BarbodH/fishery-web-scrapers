I believe I signed up a couple of years back, probably under a different name, but wasn't able to contribute as much as I would have like to.  So this is my second attempt.  I live and work in Toronto.  I will fish for pretty much anything, however, I find I spend most of my time chasing migratory rainbow trout in Lake Ontario tributaries.  I have been fishing them for a while, but its really the last 5 or so years that I really started focusing my attention on them.  I sometimes fish for them by bottom bouncing and throwing lures, but most times I find it hard to put away the float rod and reel and fish for them under a float. I also do some ice fishing, bass, pike, and walleye fishing, but again, 90% of my outings last year were spent chasing rainbows. I look forward to learning about all types of fishing on this board and contributing when ever I possibly can."

164895,John,2008-02-27 01:59:00,2956,"Welcome Gawal, we all contribute in our own way. Pics are nice too...."
164933,Gawel,2008-02-27 03:40:00,27,"Thanks for the welcomes.  I usually take a bunch of shots on my excursions.  Since I mostly fish rivers for rainbows, I know how passionate steelheaders can get, especially when pictures of fish are posted online.  Although I can appreciate their concerns, I hope I can add some pictures here in the near future (using my best judgement of course). Now on to reading some of the other topics (looks like it will take a while)."
