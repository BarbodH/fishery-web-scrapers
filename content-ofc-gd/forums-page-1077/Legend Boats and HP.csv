165285,Pinch,2008-02-27 22:07:00,231,"Hello all,  I'm looking at getting a utility boat for fishing with the family this year!  I see that there are a few people here that have a Legend boat and was wondering what they are like quality wise!  Also what size motor would be recommended for a 16' tinny?  This is the one I'm looking at.  http://www.legendboats.com/en/view/boat/16_prosport  Apparently it has a 'free' upgrade from the 9.9 HP mlh to a 25 HP mlh, but for $400 you can get a 30 HP elh!  What do you guys, and girls, think??  Thanks a bunch, Pinch"
165305,JerseyDog,2008-02-27 22:48:00,190,All I can say is get the biggest motor you can hang on it.  Also might want to consider the 4 Stroke which is the more conscious choice.  I'd like to upgrade all my motors to 4 Strokes.

165311,irishfield,2008-02-27 22:57:00,26272,Bet I know what it says! LOL
165421,pikehunter,2008-02-28 02:47:00,1659,25 hp minimum.  30 is better and if you can swing it a 40.
165429,BillM,2008-02-28 03:06:00,17367,My oldmans runs a 15ft Legend with a 40HP 4-stroke Honda.  Perfect combination.  I see about 35-37mph on the GPS flatout.
165450,mrpike,2008-02-28 05:32:00,151,THE hp MAXs is always the best way to go. For you and for resale value . I would not go lower then a 30 hp . And 4 stroke all the way when its going to be a till model .  GOOD LUCK  and always boat safely.
165524,Pinch,2008-02-28 15:10:00,231,"Thanks for your help guys, Im heading to my local marina today to see what they have available there.  Pinch"
165596,lunkerbasshunter,2008-02-28 18:44:00,2585,go with a 4 stroke!  It will save you bundles on gas!  its not as noisy as 2 strokes either.  Cheers!
165612,mikeh,2008-02-28 19:21:00,824,"you can also compare the weight of the motors, the 30hp 4 stroke weighs 172 lbs vs. 247 lbs for the 40 hp 4 stroke. I am not sure how much more speed you get out of a 40 vs 30hp ."
165616,Sinker,2008-02-28 19:28:00,8692,"Max the HP!!  I have a 16ft Starcraft with a 40 2 stroke and get 30MPH on GPS. I don't need all the power all the time, but it sure is nice in rough water to have that little bit of umpf when I need it!!!  Sinker"
165617,LeXXington,2008-02-28 19:32:00,1928,"Love mine, 15.1 alsport  with a 25 (4)  Built for economy,, Its rated up to 40hp but with just me the rattleing at that speed with waves might make all my teeth fall out.  See you on the water"
165668,danbouck,2008-02-28 21:19:00,4380,For that price go for the 30 but if you have some extra cash bump up to a four stroke! I don't see why you would need a 40 on there.
