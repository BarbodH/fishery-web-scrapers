165347,johnnyb,2008-02-28 00:45:00,3413,"There are definitely a couple operators down there, as I was asking around while I visited in the summer.  All I can remember right now is the local bait & tackle guy -- Rotten Ronnie.  This link should work:  http://web.kwic.com/serranno/  If that doesn't work, you can find him on Google ""Rotten Ronnies + Long Point"".  When I stopped in and talked to him, he had all the angles on who to go to for huts, and where to fish. Good luck!"
