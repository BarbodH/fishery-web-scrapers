After reading the Fishing News section, a Toronto man gets $4,500. fine with 53 rainbow trout and then a Thunder Bay guy gets a total fine of $10,600. for $6,000. for 30 walleyes and $4,600. for 23 brook trout. Same total of 53 fish, please explain how this works???"

IE:   My buddy KILLED two while drunk driving...he got 2 yrs.... he then drove drunk again and KILLED  his girlfriend in the process while out of jail for the holidays [while he was already in jail] Ya following me?    the same Judge imposed another year to his Driver's permit suspension...and a ""blow to go"" device in his vehicle...oh and for the KILLING of his Girlfriend....and additional 6mos probation after his release.......   what the heck!!!!..... he's no longer  a friend.  On the other hand..  My pal ....""J""  a pretty big guy...6'7""  350 lbs...was in a bar fight  when yer big they gang up on you he ended up Breaking 2 arms by ""wrist twisting""  [2 different people]   he got 6 yrs..and was released after 2 full years..I was there It was self defense.  as for my Drunken ex-buddy   he ended up doing  20 months total....go figure.  Can you explain that ?  Like I said It all depends on the Judge.."

With all the commercial fishing, poaching, and limited restocking efforts it is hard enough to keep a healthy sports fishery. Therefore if a judge understands the amount of effort and money it takes to sustain this fishery he will dole out a healthy punishment."
