I'm told that there is a huge rock near a gravel pit on Hwy.25 in rural   Iowa. For generations, kids have painted slogans, names, and obscenities on this rock, changing its character many times.   A few months back,  the rock received its latest paint job, and since then it has been left  completely undisturbed.   It's quite an  impressive sight.   Be sure to scrolldown  and check out the multiple photos.  (all angles) of the rock.  I thought the flag  was draped over the rock, but it's not. It's actually painted on the rock  too.          Here's  the artist   Ray  ""Bubba"" Sorensen.    AWESOME  Work, RAY...   Thank  you!    ""God Bless America  "" AND   ""OUR  SOLDIERS AND VETS"""
165771,Rizzo,2008-02-29 01:19:00,4754,"wow, very neat.  Sadly, it will be vandalized some day.  Didn't we just have some incident in our own country where some people ""relieved"" themselves on a war memorial (or something similar, I forget the exact details).  Nothing is sacred these days, not even honouring those who lost their lives for peoples' freedom."
