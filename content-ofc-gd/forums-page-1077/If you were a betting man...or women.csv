165778,Casey123,2008-02-29 01:38:00,461,"Just wondering what everyone's best guess is when the ice will be off Lake Simcoe, my best guess is we will still be able to fish for pearch well into the last week of March.  The longterm (March 13, 2008) shows below normal temps (and below 0 temps) till at least the middle of March. "

165786,Jen,2008-02-29 01:51:00,833,I don't think I am the betting on ice type... Have seen how fast it can go out and it is terribly frightening!

165839,Sinker,2008-02-29 03:46:00,8692,Hopefully mid april......even late april would be fine
165863,Guest lundboy,2008-02-29 05:01:00,0,Oh oh someone said the GW words again....  I say it will be on a Tuesday at 2:34PM
165867,crappieperchhunter,2008-02-29 05:07:00,2582,I think April 11 was my  latest day on the ice. A good possibility this year to get close to that. Here's hopin as I love last ice perchin.
165943,Rich,2008-02-29 15:01:00,3927,"I dunno, it can stay cold around Lake Simcoe, I don't fish there. But I want summer temps by the end of April down here. That'd be great."
165948,Beans,2008-02-29 15:23:00,3339,The ice is not as thick as previous years (12 to 14 inches) so it should go out early this spring...I'll guess no safe ice after end of March and gone by 15 April...
