I've been having some luck since the hut went out on January 21st but mostly ones and twos for the past two weeks, and this weekend it was the big Skunk for three of us. The fish seem to only bite in the first hour after sunset, then nothing. I've tried fishing in the daytime and have always found it to be useless. Yet I see people all over the ice during the daytime, surely they must be catching the odd fish ? Currently we are in 5 to 6 fow over a mud flat with weeds nearby. Does anyone know where the fish move to at this time of year, as they seem to have vanished ? Any suggestions on bait, depth, time of day, jigging vs. a set line, lures or anything else you can think of would be greatly appreciated. Good luck and tight lines on the BOG !!"
