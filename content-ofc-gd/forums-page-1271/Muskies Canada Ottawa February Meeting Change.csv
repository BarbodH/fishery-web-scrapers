32932,Weekend Angler,2007-02-10 04:52:00,13,The Muskies Canada Ottawa Chapter meeting will be held on Tuesday February 13th instead of Wednesday February 14(Valentines Day) for obvious reasons. Our wives would kill us!!  Just wanted to give a heads up for the members and any one else wishing to attend the February meeting. The topic is fishing Barbless for Muskie.  The time and place is the same;  7:30pm Downstairs in the Bells Corners Legion on Richmond Road.  Hope to see you there.  Ken Taggart

33199,crusty,2007-02-11 04:43:00,83,How much is a membership?
33217,Handlebarz,2007-02-11 10:43:00,3790,$40 untill the Oddisy then it's back to $50
33256,Weekend Angler,2007-02-11 14:44:00,13,Just another quick reminder.  There will also be a discussion about Release Tools and tactics.   Richard: Sorry you can't make it. It was either Tuesday 13th or it was going to be cancelled for the month.  It would have been a much smaller turnout on Wednesday anyway. Only the single guys... Wait a minute... isn't that all Muskie fisherman eventually...   Crusty: The cost of a membership it is $50.00 for the year ending January 31st. Pro-rated for new members.   Later  Weekend Angler
