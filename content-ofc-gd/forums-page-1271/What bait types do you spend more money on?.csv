33104,urbanangler1990,2007-02-11 00:26:00,933,i think i spend most on all
33105,huntervasili,2007-02-11 00:30:00,1604,"Crank baits for sure... Not only do they tend to be the most expensive but, I prefer them over almost everyother bait nearly all the time..."
33106,pikeie,2007-02-11 00:36:00,380,"nearly all of mine is on plastics, senkos to be specific lol allmost 10 dollers a bag, but they work great lol"
33108,urbanangler1990,2007-02-11 00:52:00,933,"yea plastics r pricy, scpecially those senkos, but hey bass cant resist em..."
33109,Black_Blade,2007-02-11 00:52:00,258,"Plastics here too...have the most success overall...with spinnerbaits a close second.  Wanna make apoint of really hammering some spinners this year...made some up with the kids, so hopefully will be a good time.  Been thinking of getting the supplies to make your own plastics, to save some $$$ and think the kids would enjoy making them too."
33111,fishindevil,2007-02-11 00:59:00,6254,"well thats a loaded question  ,being that i fish for everything,and that i have about 10 tackle boxes & bags,   it really never ever ends,it just keeps going,i buy everything all colours and sizes its really a diesease.  well its a good one..lol..lol just make sure you hide the reciepts from the girlfriend...  ...like i said there is no such thing as enought lures and rods & rells and toys for the boats,thats the only reason i have a jobis not to get ahead its to fish,fish,and more fish..  ..as long as i can get a new boat every 6 or so years...im happy although my new LUND i will have for alot longer,needless to say im working for quite a few years yet...lol..lol"
33122,Rich,2007-02-11 01:21:00,3927,Wire baits for sure.
33130,SlowPoke,2007-02-11 01:37:00,2984,Crankbaits for me without doubt but I'll bet there will be some spoonpullers looking for a box to check off.  -Brian
33137,mikeh,2007-02-11 01:57:00,824,"I spend more money on plastics, seems every time I go into the store they have some new ones I can't resist buying, also wish they'd make them last a little longer."
33212,OhioFisherman,2007-02-11 07:14:00,6623,"Per each crankbaits, I try to by soft plastics by the hundred so the cost is lower, spinnerbaits and buzzbaits are pretty snag proof so again a lower cost overall, I don`t need to carry as many. Jigs? I make a lot of my own. Topwaters are a bit pricey too depending on what you use. I carry more soft plastics than anything else. I can swim an unweight lizard or worm on the surface over weeds and lilies, swim it on a jig head like a crank, or drag it on the bottom. Plastic are probably more versitle."
33230,Rich Clemens,2007-02-11 13:16:00,3131,"I had to vote for all the above, although I have very few jigs.  Try to keep a nice well-rounded assortment.  Although jigs are high on my list for this coming June (Yeee Haaa !!)"
33239,lilkynan,2007-02-11 13:42:00,173,"Mostly spoons, flashers and heavy gear (Down riggers, cameras) - salmon hunting - but now that I moved to Barrie - I think that will change"
33246,mattyk,2007-02-11 14:00:00,2110,I spend money on all. But good crank baits are pretty pricey and muskie lures are the most expesnive lures that i get.
33268,fishdawg,2007-02-11 15:14:00,912,"as of late, its been crank baits  ( skinny trolling kind) , as well as spoons, flashers....   never ends"
33271,xrap,2007-02-11 15:22:00,683,Topwater for me. I just love that feeling when you see the big splash.
33295,Cookslav,2007-02-11 17:22:00,1457,"All of the above for sure...  Year to year I buy new lures that I find to work well...then I buy more of them just incase. And then I buy variable colors and sizes of the same bait.  I'm not one to buy a bunch of different baits all at once. I tend to test my lures, and expand on them....if that makes sence?"
33350,Ben_Daniels,2007-02-11 21:54:00,435,Definately crank baits. I use allot of soft plastics but whenever i go  to a tackle shop I end up coming home with a firetiger crankbait of some kind and I have no idea why.
