33359,Guest mistyriver1,2007-02-11 22:44:00,0,"As some of you know, I have been making some musky baits since Christmas.  Jeff (TEP) gave me some helpful pointers at the get together just after Christmas and with each one I learn a little something different each time.  Plus I have a couple of Jeff's to follow for example .    There not as good as the teacher's but they're coming along. I don't know if they'll catch any fish but they are sure are fun to make.  Anyways here's a few pics of my creations thus far...  The two on the right I had previously posted but I cut the shafts a little shorter...   Now some bucktails....   A couple of variations on these guys...I went for that burnt orange/yellow combination on the first one.   These ones I kind of like...     Got some more in the works...  Jim"
33361,lew,2007-02-11 22:58:00,12767,"Very nice indeed Jim, looks like you were paying attention in class"
33366,crusty,2007-02-11 23:08:00,83,Are those glow beads? Your colour selections are great. Keep it up so I can relieve you from a couple that are not good enough for your high standards
33382,fishindevil,2007-02-11 23:48:00,6254,"way to go jim  ,those colors look great and i have no doubt that they will catch a big ski no problem..  ..very nice work are they for sale????     cheers"
33394,brickNblock,2007-02-12 00:26:00,598,"Right -On MistR Wait to you catch a big'in on your own lure...thats the payoff. Exellent baits. You may want to attempt less thread.....say, 3 wraps per hair, then head cement....... After many baits you'll find it much easier to work with that way plus a mite easier in appearance. I never did attend 'out2llunges',  bait workshop, but know many that did and little tips as this go along way....................Jigger, now goes by the name 'northwood', also makes exellent bucktails. Keep up the good work, your colour selection is great. 'Lil tip........ When you get within an inch of the end of your tying......... Start planning on your finish wrap........ Generally, I'll tie at least 8 wraps towards the end and then work my finish back-up with all in all approx., 12 wraps to complete. My first lures used probably a spool per lure...........LOL The baits are far superior now but I get maybe almost 3 per spool........... Keep up the good work."
33395,huntervasili,2007-02-12 00:31:00,1604,"WTG... If you dont think theyll catch fish I will take em ... They do look great though and good luck getting some big guys this season, and int the future..."
33396,Bernie,2007-02-12 00:35:00,3190,Nice job on those.    Looks like they will catch a fish or two.
33397,mattyk,2007-02-12 00:35:00,2110,those are some nice looking baits!
33415,Marc Thorpe,2007-02-12 01:19:00,621,"Scumptious,they eat those"
33432,Smokey,2007-02-12 02:12:00,1278,They look great. Good Luck with them.
33439,Joey,2007-02-12 02:50:00,9122,"WOW Jim, those are really great.  I'm impressed.  I still remember what you told me about making them, now I think I'm going to have to give it a try.  Thanks  Joey"
33442,jjcanoe,2007-02-12 03:02:00,744,I have always wanted to give muskie fishing a shot but with the price of lures!!!!!! I might just start to think about making my own to cut down on the prices. BTW they look great and will for sure slay them this year!  jjcanoe
33448,Crazyhook,2007-02-12 03:29:00,1154,Jim  Nice work man! I have my eye on a few of them!

33729,Squid,2007-02-12 22:24:00,1656,Really nice job there Jim. Now you only have to wait another 5 months before you can use them.
