That leaves the copyright free to use for your Inn.  MY INN:  When your feet are burning, Soiled with the highway's dust; When your soul is yearning For the rest which it knows is just; When the sweat-drops blear your eyesight, and night rolls up the linn-- Beyond the road's last turning You'll find my Inn.  Like a bower in Maytime All year the flowers blow, And there is no haytime, For green the grasses grow. And the sunshine is your brother, and the birds are all your kin, And all the work is playtime At my Inn.  When the tempest lowers O'er the world, and thunders crash, Then friendly showers Tap merrily on the sash; For there's never a storm comes blowing to trouble you with its din In the fair vale of flowers Where hides my Inn.  Would you enter lightly? Step quickly to the door, Howe'er unsightly, Travel-stained and sore. For the door is always open, has neither bolt nor pin: You are ever welcomed rightly At my Inn.  Be it late or early, You will not lack for cheer: From the well-spring, pearly, They'll bring you vintage clear: For there's never an empty barrel, nor ever an empty bin-- And the lettuces grow curly At my Inn.  If you'd rest or slumber, The beds are clean and soft; Cast off your cumber, Mount you up aloft. And there you may sleep till doomsday with the clothes tucked round your chin: For the hours have no number At my Inn.  Oh! a place of pleasure Is this sweet Inn of mine, Where you get full measure For all that toil of thine. And they never ask a penny--to pay twice were sin !-- Bring only your heart's treasure To my Inn.  Be you faint or weary? On ever to the end ! Tho' the way be dreary, Somewhere you'll reach that bend; And beyond the road's last turning, where the flowered paths begin, You'll see lights twinkling cheery From my Inn.  Toronto, 1911."
