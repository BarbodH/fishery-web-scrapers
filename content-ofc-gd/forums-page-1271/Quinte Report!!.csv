33169,Corey,2007-02-11 03:17:00,355," I had cash! But I wasn't going to spend $159 on a pair of boots when I got a $150 pair at home. I was going to just run to Cdn Tire or Walmart and pickup some cheapies for the day. Big thanks to BricknBlock for the loaner boots. He saved me $40 or so on a cheapie set. If I can make it to the Tyler event, I will find a way to repay you.  Boots  Corey"

Didn't get on ice until 3:30ish stayed till 6:00 or so. No fish, some hits. The wind did get brutal, forcing me to constantly use the skimmer.  Some pics of the wind    This car was abandoned the whole time i was there.   Great report again! Nice to see some fish caught.  ehg"
