33644,Nater,2007-02-12 19:42:00,68,"hey guys  on the way back in form simcoe yesterday towing the hut behind a sled without a cover I think when we hit a bump my transducer for my VX1 bounced outa the holder and musta ripped off. When we got back in it wasnt there and with 6-8"" of snow on simcoe no way we would find it. I dont think that it coulda been repaired since it ripped right off of the cord. what a kick in the boys that was since we got skunked  Anyone know somewhere in canada to purchase one ASAP? I need one by the weekend  possible to run a vexilar ducer with the marcum unit? would make it much easier to find one  Nate  thanks guys"
