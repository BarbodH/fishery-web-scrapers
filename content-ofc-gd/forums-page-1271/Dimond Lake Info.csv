33532,Nemo,2007-02-12 14:27:00,727,Uhh which Diamond Lake? There are a few I think.
33542,Stretch8z,2007-02-12 14:46:00,6,The one over by Bancroft.

33568,cheese,2007-02-12 15:48:00,27,OK Diamond Lake in Bancroft has Lakers and bass. I've only fished it in the winter....caught lakers in the area furthest away from South Baptiste Lk. Rd. Good luck.....
