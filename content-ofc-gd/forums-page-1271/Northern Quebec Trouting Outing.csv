33157,glen,2007-02-11 02:53:00,2641,Nice report.  It looks like a nice day to be out.  So i guess your cleaning fish for a while.
33158,mattyk,2007-02-11 02:54:00,2110,looks like a great day! Thanks for sharing.
33170,irishfield,2007-02-11 03:17:00,26272,Great stuff Mike...but if I was that close to Tremblant I wouldn't have been sitting out on the ice. I'd have been riding the gondola up and then been skiin the North face all day!
33175,Greencoachdog,2007-02-11 03:25:00,8163,Excellent report and pics Mike!!! Looks a bit chilly up there though?
33179,Joey,2007-02-11 03:32:00,9122,"Thanks Mike, that report was great.  Love the part about you setting up the hut as your son cleans up in the fish dept  Looks like it was a great day.  Joey"
33181,Gerritt,2007-02-11 03:43:00,6129,"Mike awesome report and pics!!!! Glad to see the BlackCat is working well for you... I have no complaints about mine either thus far! heats a small in quick order, infact turns it into an oven in no time! Nice to see the little man getting into em.. always great to see the smile on a kids face when a fish is on! one question??? In the one picture with your son with the ski goggles on... their appears to be alot of down trees Logging? or natural causes?   again awesome report man... I may just have to drive my rear end up there for a little fishing adventure!   Gerritt."
33186,Mike the Pike,2007-02-11 03:47:00,3421,  Gerritt that would be some of the damage we received during the 1998 ice storm.You will notice alot of downed and damaged trees in various areas of Quebec.Mike

33200,huntervasili,2007-02-11 04:43:00,1604,WTG Man... Great Job with the report and pictures and taking the little guy out to get some fish...
33216,Clampet,2007-02-11 10:06:00,1947,"Very special, mon vieux! Some great memories were made, eh! Those fish are a welcome break, we do not see those Speckeld Trout very often.  The little devils cooperated very well. They will make a very scrumtious meal. Interesting snow buggy there, I can imagine Santa being envious.  Well worth the trip, and awesome pictures."

33255,JEREMY,2007-02-11 14:37:00,300,Great report and pics the onlythingthat would have made the report better would be a LEAFS towel in that pic.lol
33258,lew,2007-02-11 14:46:00,12767,"Thanks Mike, sounds like you had a great day.  Luv the part about your son catching all the fish while your still setting up  Great idea taking the Coleman on the ice with you too, lots better than cold food !!"

33296,carll2,2007-02-11 17:25:00,443,hey mike good to see you had an awesome day. just from seeing your pictures i booked myself there for a day in march. must have been lots of traffic on the 15 up near mont tremblant?
33422,Mike the Pike,2007-02-12 01:51:00,3421,Carl there was not much traffic however I did see a couple of boneheads who were driving too fast do the tango with black ice and end up driving off the road.  You will like this place for ice fishing .Many times during the day the staff would drop by on there ski doo's and ask how we were doing they were willing to move us if we were not catching .Very clean and well organized place.You should enjoy it.This is one of the best Trout outfitters I have visited so far.good luck in March. MTP.
33445,camillj,2007-02-12 03:20:00,1988,What a great report !  I'll bet your son will remember that for his whole life !  IMHO those little specks are better than any other fish and for sure the tastiest !  Thanks for sharing !
33446,ccmtcanada,2007-02-12 03:24:00,7971,Nice job!  Great pics and a great time.  At least you guys saw fish come out of that hole!!! LOL.  Thanks for sharing!
