32304,Big Cliff,2007-02-08 10:25:00,6899,justherb asked me to post this for him.  OFC - I can't get on to the site. When I try to log in it tells me I'm not a member and when I try to register or re-register it tells me there is already a justherb. I haven't signed on for a couple of months. Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong?  Thanks Herb please respond to his email address    [email protected]
32310,Terry,2007-02-08 11:28:00,14456,did he reply to the email that was sent to him to complete the register process often in ends up in their spam/junk mail folder and they miss it
32316,misfish,2007-02-08 12:00:00,29133," You got spam/junl mail .HEHEHEHEHE I know,it,s still early.LOL"
32321,Gerritt,2007-02-08 12:24:00,6129,"Have justherb try the ""Help if forgotten my password!!!"" link it will email him his password to the valid email address he provided... hopefully it'll help   Gerritt."
32619,Big Cliff,2007-02-09 10:45:00,6899,"He may in fact have originally registered on my computer, neither of us can remember for sure (we're both getting old LOL).  I was busy all day yesterday and will be in and out quite a bit today, so if someone can sort this out for him please send the replies to his email address. [email protected]  Thanks  Big Cliff"
32694,just herb,2007-02-09 15:18:00,7,"Thanks for the suggestionson how to get on the site. I ran into the same problems as before when I tried them. Either got a ""no member by that name"" or ""already a member with that name"". So I tried to log on as usual and I am here. As Big Cliff said I'm getting old and forgetful but not as much as him. LOL  I have no idea as to what I was doing but should be OK now.  Thanks again Herb"

33219,Big Cliff,2007-02-11 11:29:00,6899,"It's not Cliff's dock, it's Andy's dock  He just lets me and my buddies fish there if we are nice to him LOL."
