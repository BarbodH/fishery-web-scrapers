33669,RobHall,2007-02-12 20:26:00,261," I think you are right about Matt Lindland being too small for Fedor.  Just take a look at these Feder highlights and tell me what you think.  Matt will be beat badly.  Got to give it to him though....he is stepping in with one of the best, if not the best heavyweight out there today in my opinion.  He hasnt lost an MMA fight since late in 2000.  He's beaten many great fighters like Cro Cop, Mark Coleman twice, Renato Sobral, Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira to name a few.  With Feder at 230 lbs, Lindland will giving up 20 to 30 lbs if he comes in at his target weight.  <object width=""425"" height=""350""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXC-tUwfeVE""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXC-tUwfeVE""></param><param name=""wmode"" value=""transparent""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXC-tUwfeVE"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" width=""425"" height=""350""></embed></object>   FOTB "
33677,Bitsmith2k,2007-02-12 20:42:00,396,fotb.. thanks for that clip.. i could watch fedor highlights all day.. my two favs would have to be the zulu and randleman..
33685,charlesn,2007-02-12 20:54:00,551,The randleman fight was insane.  Randleman was coming off a huge upset KO of Cro-cop.  He picks Fedor up and absolutely slams him down on to his head/neck and gains side control in the process.  About 0.02 seconds later the fight is over and Fedor has won the match easily.  Fedor is not human.  Charles
33691,RobHall,2007-02-12 21:02:00,261, No problem Bitsmith2K.  I would have to say he is one of my favs too.  I agree the fight with the 400lb zulu was a good one and the randleman fight wasnt bad either.   FOTB 
33704,Crazyhook,2007-02-12 21:28:00,1154,Zulu is a can though
33707,Bitsmith2k,2007-02-12 21:44:00,396," touche.. but he is training with his dad, and wants a rematch..  i hope we see him v. barnett sometime this year.."
33864,glirw,2007-02-13 02:11:00,200,"Zulu ? Are you kidding ? His style resembles that of Eric Butterbean Esch .... now , THAT would be a nice slugfest that would last 10 seconds !!  Fedor is a god among mortals .... and you have to teach me how you linked that video to the message board like that ..... I tried it didn't work :@"
33867,Crazyhook,2007-02-13 02:28:00,1154,"lol @ "" Zulu"" wanting a rematch... dude cmon!"
32119,dobee,2007-02-07 22:31:00,301,"if you watch the fight silva had his arms on lutters shoulder for most of time he was mounted which stopped lutter from getting punching power, silva is awsome, hopefully some big name sin middleweight will challenege for the belt. someone worthy, not someone who wins the best of the hasbeens.  fedor is the #1 heavyweight, he has not lost in his mma career i believe, if he has its only been 1 loss, lindland has no chance. hes got balls like eddie sanchez, but no chance.  GSP could easily drop down and fight silva, that would be 1 hell of a fight.  Terry martin vs mike swick?>!?!?!?!??! hell ya!  and what about tyson griffen and frank edgar?? man what a battle, and one hell of a knee bar, still dont know how he didnt tap.."
32135,GbayGiant,2007-02-07 23:19:00,1780,"Go, Chuck !"
32735,Crazyhook,2007-02-09 17:33:00,1154,aNYONE HAVE THOUGHT ON THE NEXT pRIDE usa SHOW  I think that Dan Henderson will beat Wanderlei Silva
32744,glirw,2007-02-09 18:24:00,200,Silva is gonna come back very strong after losing to CroCop .  Henderson is gonna get KTFO'ed.  First fight between those two :  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xe4ur_sil...-12900-pride-12
32745,Crazyhook,2007-02-09 18:29:00,1154,Henderson has been training with lindland and Team Quest and has had a new striking coach for the last year. You watch he will be a threat on his feet. Hendo is also a fisherman  Hendo with my daughter 
32757,JPD,2007-02-09 19:14:00,296,"Nice link, thanks for the vid.   JP"
33526,Mark Kulik,2007-02-12 14:13:00,348,"That was good -that Silva is an animal! to be honest Henderson can learn to strike but it still won't put him in Silvas league, it may help but in the end barring a submission I predict the Axe Murderer will win!"
30400,Gerritt,2007-02-03 18:12:00,6129,I know I will be for sure!   Here are my predictions....   Anderson Silva Over Travis Lutter  Roger Huerta Over John Halverson  Mirko Cro Cop Over Eddie Sanchez  Quinton Jackson Over Marvin Eastman  Scott Smith Over Patrick Cote   Looks like a great Fight Card.... Silva is headlining....but I think Cro Cop will be the fight to watch!  Have fun tonight boys & Girls!  Gerritt.
30406,pigeonfisher,2007-02-03 18:22:00,696,I think I will wait to see this one on Monday.
30408,Rob,2007-02-03 18:23:00,467,"Ohh Yeah!!  I agree with most except for Travis Lutter and Patrick Cote fights. Lutter is pretty good on the ground, I think he will submit Silva. Glad to see Cro Cop in the UFC, someone need to kick the begeebers out of Tim Silvia. (hopefully Randy Cotoure  !!).  Rob C"
30445,sirfish,2007-02-03 20:04:00,175,All fun agames till someone gets killed. Can't believe it hasn't happened yet. The things we will watch for entertainment. Post your feelings when someone dies. I'm sure you won't be as enthused. Just my opinoin.
30462,Davis Battah,2007-02-03 20:45:00,31,"Actually Sirfish,  It's a much safer sport than people think/ are aware of.  Professional boxing is far more dangerous and has had numerous deaths and often brain related injuries.  People die in Nascar, but I've never heard a negative comment towards that.  There have been no deaths resulting from a profesional MMA fight.  I think some just see it as a barbaric sport and don't see the technical side and the devotion to the training that these guys have given.  It's one of the safest fastest growning sports out there.  Heck I wish I could do it!  Cheers,"
30475,Carp,2007-02-03 21:10:00,1488,"I watched the first few UFC's, but haven't seen any lately. When it's something new, there's always some excitement. If I get a chance, I'll watch a bit, but it's not on my ""to do list."""
30481,ChrisK,2007-02-03 21:17:00,2772,"Davis, I heard somewhere that according to the stats, fishing is one of the most dangerous sports in the world....... "
30499,Spiel,2007-02-03 22:03:00,9065,"....A bunch of testosterone fueled men pummeling the tar out of each other, ah no I won't be watching."
30500,Terry,2007-02-03 22:14:00,14456,"so many people complain, when clearly they have on idea what they are talking about.. I will be watching it..."

30503,Roy,2007-02-03 22:22:00,13728,"People fights are fine. Hitting another human being is fine. Hey, there's money in it. They banned noodle fights cause there's less money in it...also, hitting someone elses' noodle is bad."

30518,GbayGiant,2007-02-04 00:15:00,1780,"A lot of sports have the possibility of death, Canada's favorite Hockey is more dangerous if you ask me (puck to the face, skate to the face, concussions from hits), football, rugby etc.. etc... etc.... the list goes on, this is what these guys train for, sure if they were to fight an average man they could do a lot more damage but they are prepared mentally to take the pain and protect themselves as good as possible, eventually there could be a death but  the same goes for everyone who drives a vehicle, does that stop you from driving ?  I'll watch it, these guys have a lot of heart, modern day Gladiators."
30532,Clampet,2007-02-04 00:45:00,1947,"Anderson Silva is amazing. I like the way he shut that reheaded punks' mouth, I can't remember his name."
30539,Crazyhook,2007-02-04 01:28:00,1154,Cote!!!!! should be a great show

30602,glirw,2007-02-04 05:17:00,200,"I just finished watching the events , and I have mixed views.  It was a great card on paper , how can you not like it when you have Mirko CroCop and Quinton jackson fighting in the US , and top that off with Anderson Silva defending his belt (not) against travis lutter  The Cote fight was decent , not enough action , Cote seemed pretty explosive and certainly had good kicks and strikes , he deserves his win no doubt . I just wish it was an all about slugfest like Scott Smith brought last time .  Cro Cop's fight was just FUNNY , how Sanchez RAN AWAY from him all around the ring , that's just hilarious , and retarded at the same time , but it was obvious Cro Cop would win .  You could definately tell both CroCop and Jackson were NERVOUS , neither has fought in a cage for a WHILE , if ever , and you could tell they were being extra cautious . I was expecting a big slam from Jackson , or a spectacular KO , but I'll settle .  The short lightweight fight isn't even worth mentioning  And the main event where The striker tapped the submission guy was just boring to watch . You could tell lutter wasn't at the top of his game . I am not taking anythin away from Silva , that dude is just awesome everywehere , but what happened to SPRAWL buddy ?!?! Especially with lutter's sloppy double leg attempts . You could tell Lutter was dehidrated and slooowww , and that cost him , and he got an embarresing loss on his record from somebody who IS a BJJ black belt but is not known for submissions .  The next card is gonna be more interesting for sure . Former champs making their way back , and Couture gonna try and prove that Sylvia sucks , good luck with that."
30690,Mark Kulik,2007-02-04 16:30:00,348,"I watched the fights last night and thought it was entertaining but not the best card I've seen for sure! Sirfish -people have been fighting for years! the ring/octagon is where violence belongs, these guys are highly trained atheletes , and know the risks before they step in , look at the concusions and injury rate in hockey or race cars! this is not just guys throwing punches and kicks , it is very much a strategic game in there, boxing is far more dangerous, taking 500 head shots in a 12 rounder is what causes the damage, plus the refs step in quick, long live MMA !"
30697,CoolB,2007-02-04 17:01:00,47,Best part of the show was Crocop coming out to the PRIDEFC  theme music.  All in all a boring show unfortunately. Can't wait for PRIDE 32 The Real Deal.....then the next show....then the next show....hehehe.  Oh and yes.....LONG LIVE MMA!!!!!
30703,dobee,2007-02-04 17:52:00,301,"loved most of the fights, but the most entertaining was the lightweight fight between edgar and griffen that knee  bar at the end was insane!!!!! i couldnt believe he didnt tap,   great ufc... the best are still to come in '07"
30835,JPD,2007-02-05 01:20:00,296,"I have to agree on a couple of things, the fights were less than spectacular but I will love to see Cro Cop tee off on Silvia's head. His opponent's facial expression was like a deer caught in the head lights except he was running scared not just standing there. Anderson Silva's take down defense was less than spectacular as well but nice choke out on Lutter. He needed to be punished a bit more for not making weight for a championship fight when he obviously had a bit of gut left over.  Secondly I definitely agree that MMA is waaayyy safer than boxing and most other sports as Mark said. The refs do a great job and keep those guys from getting out of control. They are truly gifted athletes who have sacrificed years of their lives to master so many disciplines. I did notice that there was a lot of booing from the crowd last night because of the ""lack of action"" in their opinion however 99% of them would be out of breath by just walking to the ring!!! They have no clue how much endurance training these guys do.  Can't wait to see the next one, maybe Franklin will bounce back!!  JP"
