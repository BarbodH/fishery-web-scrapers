33355,chilli,2007-02-11 22:34:00,199,Thanks for the replies guys. I'm surprised I didn't see more pike. Salmonoids and walleye seem to dominante the replies. I haven't got out too much this weekend so no pics from me. My kid keeps winning these hocky games so maybe no fishing for 2 weeks!!!  Great pics  :worthy:  Hey Dan I love your camera. Nice shots.
33387,Mike the Pike,2007-02-12 00:00:00,3421,Artificials 90% of the time.I go to the good old worm when all else fails.  white Mr.Twisters.   The good old red devil.  A very large Rapala  manns lures  spoons .williams quick silver  Rapala  7 inch Yozuri hydro minnow.   Mike
33512,ccmtcanada,2007-02-12 13:21:00,7971," Here's a pike I caught just last month from shore...on I believe a Jointed Shad Rap #7....I had tried minnows a bunch of times over the past year, but truthfully I have NEVER caught anything using one.  "
33553,Puckhead,2007-02-12 15:12:00,377,I don't even remember the last time I used live bait...  ice fishing a few years ago I think.
33561,misfish,2007-02-12 15:30:00,29133,"I am a live bait guy only in the winter months,at times,other then that it,s all artificial.                   "
32920,chilli,2007-02-10 04:16:00,199,"Well with the VHS topic hot the MNR has already hinted that if things are as bad as they suspect, live bait fish including all auquatic baits (leeches, crayfish, frogs etc.) may be banned within 2 years. Your live bait may be reduced to maggots, worms, crickets etc.  This thread is not a VHS thread however. With the possibility however that it may cause the discontinued use of live baits, I've started this thread for catches using artificials only. Post your pictures where you used stick/body baits, plastics, spoons, fly's etc without tipping with live bait of any kind including worms.  Now Fishmaster I know this will be a tough one to stay out of but please guys............... lets limit the replies to artificial catches only and refrain from reopening the live bait debate..........  get it?  I'm going to try to hit the ice tomorrow between games and I'll bring the camera. Hopefully I'll put up the first post.  Oh ya tell us what you used and if you can get it in the picture is even better Dan"
32929,huntervasili,2007-02-10 04:41:00,1604,You are talking Ice only or all fishing chilli...
33007,chilli,2007-02-10 17:20:00,199,"All fishing, ice/stream/boat etc Just looking to see how guys make out on artificials. It may be possible that it's mandatory soon so lets see if there are any success stories out there on a regular basis.  I would however say that the ice pics will be the hardest to come by. Prove me wrong and show us how you did it  Dan"
33010,danc,2007-02-10 17:30:00,4677,"I can't remember the last time I've used organic bait. Probably while ice fishing, which was several years ago. I use 100% artificials these days.      "
33014,ccmtcanada,2007-02-10 17:51:00,7971,"Here's a nice Walleye...30"" and 11 pounds.   A close up of the lure...    My wife and I didn't catch anything on live bait this past year...all our fish were on artificials."
33015,lew,2007-02-10 17:58:00,12767,"Except for a few minnows we used on the Lower Niagara last winter and a couple ice fishing trips, I haven't used live bait in probably 40 years and I usually do pretty good."
33018,eye-tracker,2007-02-10 18:10:00,89,"Hello, I fish walleye tournaments and live bait is slowly being replaced by artificial. A good example was this past summer in July when I was fishing Michigan's Upper Peninsula with Ron Seelhoff - the 2006 PWT angler of the year. Most of the anglers where catching fish with live bait and bottom bouncers and Ron was contour trolling Lead-core and small shad raps to catch the big fish.   -sheldon"
33020,huntervasili,2007-02-10 18:11:00,1604,"I too seldom use live bait... The only times being in the winter ice fishing or when I gou out with friends who just want to catch fish the easy way ... besides that I always use artificials, from plastics, to cranks, poppers, whatever..."
33023,FishFinder,2007-02-10 18:19:00,481,A small bow caught on a Jig...    Although I have to admit I am pretty Roe dependant
33028,Castmaster,2007-02-10 18:49:00,86,Strictly artificial anymore. 
33035,jjcanoe,2007-02-10 19:28:00,744,A nice river 'bow caught on a rebel minnow this fall. I haven't caught one on roe in a while.   jjcanoe
33038,drufis,2007-02-10 19:51:00,45,Only use artificial.  My 2 year old girl picked out this storm lure for me while she was running around walmart and I caught my first walleye with it on Rice.    
33040,drufis,2007-02-10 19:58:00,45,"Opps, can't forget this prize winning sunfish caught by my other daughter with a platic worm.  "
33047,setomonkey,2007-02-10 20:17:00,872,"I fish artificials 99% of the time and I do okay. Well, some days anyway!  I think all, or almost all, the pics I've posted on this board have been on artificials.  Mike"
33061,fishindevil,2007-02-10 21:35:00,6254," well here is just a few of the many caught on artificial....but i still love my dew worms,they will without a dout catch anything that swims....so there they are...cheers"
33064,fishergirl72,2007-02-10 21:45:00,455,"Here are some of the beauties that I have caught on artifical lures. Using Shad Raps, worm harnesses with Berkley power worms and northport nailers have caught me some great fish!   The Salmon was my best catch ever weighing in at 26.9 lbs and she won me the ExtremeFishergirl Contest.   IMG]http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p134/fishergirl72/0009.jpg[/img]   "
33069,OhioFisherman,2007-02-10 22:09:00,6623,"I don`t have a lot of pictures and really am not good at figuring out how to post them anyway.  Caught a lot of fish on artificial baits, including some you wouldn`t expect to like carp and catfish.  I don`t usually use live bait."
33080,Motorhead,2007-02-10 22:29:00,163,Here`s a couple of pictures of some smallmouth caught on a small hook tipped with a piece of rubber worm...    and       Yummy....  
33091,FinS,2007-02-10 23:19:00,463,so when are they gonna ban artificials???  This hard water season ive caught plenty of perch and pickeral(walleye) on w2-w3 rapala ice jigs who needs minnows when you have a handful of artificials
33092,FinS,2007-02-10 23:24:00,463,
33094,dheitzner,2007-02-10 23:33:00,314,"no pic, but yesterday i caught a 13.5""(actually measured) perch on a medium gold jigging shad!"
33095,jediangler,2007-02-10 23:33:00,1923,"All the fish I catch are on artificials, as that is all I use. This one might be the most surprising although I'm sure some guys (Ohio Fisherman) have done it as well. "
33116,Greencoachdog,2007-02-11 01:09:00,8163,"When I fish the dam, I'm always using artificial.      All of these fish except the pike (and thousands more) were caught on an inline spinner with a dressed hook."
33132,mason05,2007-02-11 01:48:00,258,Here's a pike I caught on a perch xrap just before the ice hit this year.    Small largemouth from late fall off a mini xrap  
33304,Cookslav,2007-02-11 17:53:00,1457,"I'm 100% artifical bait guy.... Used to fish some limited live bait, but stopped about 4-5 years ago completely. I just enjoy the challange, and Invlovment more I guess?  Sorry no picks of the lures...they are all removed before I take any pics(I'm a bit of a stickler for getting the hooks out ASAP) But these are all recent catches from last season, and every one was Taken on artificals.   Little Sauble river football on an off set spinner Black white and green.    Another decent Sauble area smallie....one of many that day dragging a black jig through Deep reeds.   My PB 31"" Sauble Steelhead on a last ditch effort...roe, flies, plastics were not cutting it this day. So O'L faithfull came out and did the job....origional Rapala black & Silver   Algonquin park Splake, on a Perch colored floating Rapala.   2 Algonquin Lake trout both took a Perch colored Rapala.   30"" Bay of Quinte Pickeral on a clown color X-rap   My PB 31"" x18"" Quinte Pickeral on the same Clown Color X-rap   I guess its safe to say Rapala made my year a little more productive this year"
