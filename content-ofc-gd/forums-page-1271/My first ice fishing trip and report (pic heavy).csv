33509,007,2007-02-12 13:19:00,537,Thanks for all the kind words guys.  Glad you liked the pics.  It was just such a great feeling out there and I'm sure I will try to get out there again before it melts.  I will really consider renting a hut to get out of the wind and cold next time though.  Good luck to all of you out there on the ice 007

33842,007,2007-02-13 01:33:00,537,Thanks again guys.  I'll try and get another ice fishing report in before the end of the season.  Snag - you're right it was quite a walk but well worth it.  Perhaps I should do more ice trekking to lose a few more pounds - would certainly make my wife happier if I did LOL
