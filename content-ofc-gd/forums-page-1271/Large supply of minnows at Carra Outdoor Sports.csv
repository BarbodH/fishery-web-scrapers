I have just received 7,000 minnows and have another 10,000 coming for the weekend.  Checking around the area it seems most dealers are out of minnows and most of the suppliers are not trapping many lately. It seems that their ponds are not producing many to trap and the high demand for minnows is strectching quite far as a result of the bait ban in the area.  We should be in good shape for the week and weekend. Moon's in Deseronto has minnows as well as Sandy's in Stirling.  Best regards, Sam"
