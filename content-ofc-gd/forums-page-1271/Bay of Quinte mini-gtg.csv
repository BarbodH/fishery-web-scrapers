33154,Corey,2007-02-11 02:45:00,355,"Well, twas the night before quinte and all through OFC, some members were sleeping some members were not.  We all woke up pretty early, some ealier than others. Troutologist, Uncle Buck, Gerritt and myself all hit the road about 3:30am from Hamilton. Stopped in Ajax to pickup GoneFishing and then made a beeline to Carra's in Belleville. It seems our chauffeur has a slight relation to Mario Andretti as we made quite possibly record time, such good time we got there 1/2 hour before Carra's opens.  Once Laurie and Glen opened the store (at the proper time), we were pleasently made aware that for today, all of the OFC members there were also getting 10% off any tackle we needed to pickup. We also bought a load of minnows that were specially put aside for us and as it turned out was about 3 times as many as we needed, but we got a good deal nonetheless. Total props out to Sam and his staff at Carra in Belleville, would recommend them in a heartbeat to anyone heading that way.  Next we are going to omit the part of the story that I am sure others will tell. Don't believe them, I wore boots today!  After hooking up with a few other OFC members we headed out to the secret spot and started the journey. Out to the red buoy we walked, gear in tow. Turns out because of lack of space Gerritt was unable to bring his hut. From ths point on, we will refer to Uncle Buck's hut as jabba the hut, darn that thing is big.  We got all setup, drilled a series of holes and started to fish... not much going on.  A couple of the guys headed on a scouting trip to look for a place to move and setup camp number 2. They found a small pressure crack that had opened up along a transition and while checking it out, watched a guy 50ft away land a 5+ pound walleye. Cha Ching! we now have location of camp number 2. Drilled some more holes, in a more spread out pattern. a few minutes later we hear a slight roar, which turned out to be Uncle Buck hollaring FISH ON!!! wee little guy, back in the drink he went. Not much longer and a few more fish are pulled up, 2-3 pounders, good eaters.  Things are kinda getting slow, the wind is picking up (ok... it could have been gale force winds at that point). While some of us are hiding from the wind, yet another, much louder roar erupts. While not being able to fully comprehend what was said, the next thing heard was so load and clear it had people from far away coming over. There was no mistaking Uncle Buck (with a big smiley on the face) yelling out IT'S HUGE!!!. Keep in mind Uncle Buck has never fished for walleye through the ice and landing a solid 8 pound 4 ounce whopper was definately the highlight of the day... but wait! Was it really the highlight of the day? Adam and Sandy, tucked away in their hut brought another bohemoth to the hole, only to find out that the fish's head was to big to fit through the hole. Maybe a tie for highlights... 1 huge fish landed another huge fish released without coming through the hole due to size.  In the end, the wind got to be a little too much to handle and we decided to pack it in for the day and head home. It was a great experience for everyone there and a lot of OFC'ers met eachother for the first time and it seems everyone had a pretty good time.  I'm sure people will post some picks later on in this thread and add their bits and pieces to it.  Corey"
