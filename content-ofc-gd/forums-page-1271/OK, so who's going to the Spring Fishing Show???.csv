32685,Ron,2007-02-09 14:55:00,1683,"I'll be there setting up the Muskies Canada Booth Wednesday night and working the floor on Friday and Saturday. We'll have booth numbers 134-135. Not sure where exactly but was told it is on a corner. We will have tickets available for the Muskie Oddessy there as well. Please feel free to pop in for a visit and bring lots of CASH!...  We will have membership forms for renewals as well as for new members. Don't be afraid to ask us questions about the Lake Simcoe Muskie Restoration Project. We have had some trying experiences with this project but every experience is a great learning experience. The Sir Sanford Fleming Collage has also stepped in on this project with us as well. This is a great opportuinty for 1st year graduates to practice what they have studied.  There are other MCI projects under way but the Toronto Chapter has undertaken this one. Hopefully there will be a few other members from Kitchener-Waterloo and Hamilton in particular, to help with any questions on what we are all about."
