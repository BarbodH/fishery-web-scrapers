33305,pameladallaire,2007-02-11 17:55:00,470,Great report Wayne!
33332,Gerritt,2007-02-11 20:49:00,6129,Wayne cool report!! Thanks for sharing! Did you happen to get the number off of the hut that left their crap behind? If not perhaps in the future you could note them... it is against the law to litter water included...  Sounds like you had a great time though! Awesome!   Gerritt.
33334,irishfield,2007-02-11 21:03:00,26272,"Nope...I'll have to put my CSI team together on the pictures I took to get the # off the hut door! I think my neighbour knew whos hut it was, so we'll be ""talkin"" I'm sure!"
33335,Gerritt,2007-02-11 21:07:00,6129,I have all the Seasons on DVD your welcome to watch them for any tips it might take to catch em.... I am sure Grissom will give you valuable pointers.  LOL   Gerritt.
33339,carll2,2007-02-11 21:24:00,443,looks like ya had a good time..i always look forward to your reports they are some of the best..whens the next report ?lol
33447,irishfield,2007-02-12 03:28:00,26272,"Around March 13th Carl and hopefully with many Laker shots ! That's Laker...not the usual ""lake"" shots!"
33474,Carp,2007-02-12 05:43:00,1488,Thanks for the report Wayne. Too bad the fish didn't co-operate. At least you had someone to get cozy with back at the cottage.  The boat looks great. It'll look sweet parked at your dock. Enjoy.
33498,kennyman,2007-02-12 12:27:00,737,HMMM.................chesterfield rugby eh    LOL! Sweet looking boat! Nice cottage.I'm envious.  Nice life Wayne.
33517,Raf,2007-02-12 13:40:00,3495,"Nice shots Wayne.  You've a great place up there.  When it's that cold, the fish seem to know it too and tend to shutdown."
33534,Sherriff,2007-02-12 14:29:00,252,Great looking new ride Irish!  Looks amazing.....  Sherriff
33543,dustink,2007-02-12 14:47:00,526,"Nice report Wayne!  Tells a great story, and some great pics too!  That boat is beautiful, and I'm looking forward to seeing the reports this summer!!  dk"
33548,Guest mistyriver1,2007-02-12 15:00:00,0,"Nice report Wayne, some really nice pics."
33549,DanTheMan,2007-02-12 15:04:00,257,"Great report Wayne.Love the NEW ride, she looks like a beauty"
33559,ccmtcanada,2007-02-12 15:21:00,7971,"Awesome read!  That's dedication, heading out in -30s and -40s with the wind chill!!!  Thanks for taking the time to post the pics and write the report that went along with it.  Sweet boat too!!!"
33580,irishfield,2007-02-12 16:55:00,26272,"Thanks Guys and Cliff...I wouldn't say too dedicated! Needed to drill for water...that or use the outhouse in those temps LOL. Figured may as well fish if I was getting water. Dedication would have been sledding 5 miles up the NE Arm, where I would have had a better chance at catchin something. Was easier just to drill there and then quickly retreat to a heated cottage only 200 feet away! LOL"
33594,lunkerbasshunter,2007-02-12 18:10:00,2585,that was a fun report to read!  Thanks for sharing!  Love your new boat!!!  Cheers!
33732,Squid,2007-02-12 22:36:00,1656,"Nice boat Wayne!! We can race up in the west arm   . I only problem I see in the picture of you in the boat is that you are wearing a leafs sweatshirt   Sorry Carp, had to."
33748,irishfield,2007-02-12 23:06:00,26272,Gotta wear the free Christmas gift clothing somewhere Pete. I knew someone was going to clue into it after the picture was taken.  Did you wanna have a kicker race...or did you want me to fire up big bertha?
33090,irishfield,2007-02-10 23:16:00,26272," Nope...that's just my 200sx portable that I use mainly to see what depth I drilled at. I've had it for many years..and the 6 volt lantern batteries hold up very well. As matter of fact they are a few, possibly 4, years old. I used it many times a couple summers ago...stored all winter in the cottage, used it twice for probably 6 hours each time last summer and once again stored in the cold and used it a few hours this week. Batteries still okay and for those worried about their screens in the cold....worked just fine with a minor fog up when I took it from the warmed up cottage out into the -27C. No issues with the screen actually freezing and it didn't fog up the first time I used it taken from the cold storage location out onto the lake."
33117,cisco,2007-02-11 01:14:00,597,"Lake's full of thievin' whitefish. They love taking minnows off jigs. Try using tiny hooks with little or no weights and let the minnow squirm around on bottom. When you get a strike, let em take a minute or so to ingest the bait.  Mmmm! Panfried whitefish!  I don't generally fish where another hut has just left. For one, he left for a reason, probably to do with poor fishing.  Second, the fish left are now a bit thinned out and what's left is probably there since able to thwart angler antics.  Sorry you didn't catch anything. Always next time."
33125,Joey,2007-02-11 01:28:00,9122,"Great report wayne.  I can't believe you actually made it Wednesday before you went for your conjugal boat visit, it must have killed you  Sorry about the skunk, but you'll get em next time.  Joey"
33127,irishfield,2007-02-11 01:32:00,26272, I knew better..that if we stopped on the way into town that it would be well after dark before we saw the cottage!
33144,Spiel,2007-02-11 02:13:00,9065,....Great post Wayne with some great shots. Super looking boat as well but what's wrong with black.
33145,silveradosheriff,2007-02-11 02:16:00,1025,That is one sweet ride!  :-)
33148,irishfield,2007-02-11 02:29:00,26272, Nothing Chris...this way they'll be able to tell us apart!
33151,Spiel,2007-02-11 02:39:00,9065,"....lol, I'm sure everyone willl be able tell tell us apart Wayne when you blow by me and leave me bobbing around in your wake."
