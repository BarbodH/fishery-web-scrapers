33277,ccmtcanada,2007-02-11 15:55:00,7971,"Well, as stated in a thread earlier in the week, bly booked a hut on Scugog for an early Valentine's day treat!  Well, we got there at 4:30pm...a half an hour early, but Kerry and Cyndi (operators of Lake Scugog Ice Hut Rentals) got our stuff loaded up right away and took us to our hut.  They were great hosts and made every effort to make our stay as comfortable as possible.  I've never been ice fishing before, so it was kinda cool for me standing out in the middle of a lake that I usually fish in the summer.  Here's a pic of bly outside our hut and a pic when the sun was going down.        Once inside, we got everything ready.  The hut was propane heated and nice and warm for us.  There was a minnow bucket inside already filled with bait.  There were 4 holes inside so we set up our 2 tipups and 2 rods/holders and then waited for some action.  The ice was nice and solid...around 10"" think from what I could tell.  Bly then made us some fresh coffee on the propane stove and we were all set!        Kerry came around to check up on us to see if we needed any minnows and noticed that our hut was dark, so he dropped off a lantern for us to use.  At around 6:30pm, one of our tipups was set off!!  Carole was closest, so she set the hook and began to bring in the fish.  Unfortunately, the fish ended up with a free minnow!!!  Oh well, we'll wait for the next hit.  Suddenly, the rod in front of me went crazy, but I was too slow....by the time I picked up the rod to set the hook, it was gone.  Things were kinda slow after that, so we had our romantic valentine's dinner.     We then decided to break out the cards!  I noticed that ice fishing tackle is downsized....so we used downsized cards as well....lol.  And you guessed it...we played Go Fish...she beat me 3 games to 2.     We had the option to stay out there all night long...Kerry offered to pick us up at around 5am, but we decided to leave at 11pm instead.  With Carole fighting off bronchitis and the bite being really slow, we thought we'd head on home.  Kerry and Cyndi run a great operation.  They were out checking on us to see if we needed anything. He even shovelled some snow around the hut to cut on drafts coming from underneath.  Kerry was going to drop by to fish with us for a bit as well, but we ended up leaving early.  They take you right out to your hut on a snowmobile.  He has a heated bathroom on the ice as well, so that's really convenient.  Our hut came equipped with 4 holes, 2 nice folding lawn chairs and a great comfy futon!  So, I must say, that even though we were skunked, I had a great time out there.  I can see us doing this again soon...I'm not much of a cold weather person, but hey, this was like fishing in luxury....LOL.  Thanks bly!  It was the best valentine's gift I've ever had."

33410,charlied,2007-02-12 01:03:00,584,don't worry i got skunked there too......guess scugog has no fish....LOL.  6 hours sitting in a chair in the wind with no fish  I got pretty frustrated and angry....then realized i was so cold so the anger and frustration went away!
33412,canadian_copper,2007-02-12 01:05:00,925,TOO BAD ON THE SKUNK BUT A GREAT V-DAY GIFT INDEED!!!
33414,Bassnbows,2007-02-12 01:16:00,58,Just make sure you have enough PROPANE to get u through the night if u decide to stay  next time. We were out from Fri to Sun with them $110/ea . Switched huts three times  bacause  Kerry had a few large groups going out. Ran out of PROPANE both nights.  The fishing was not  good at all. Got 8 small perch in all that time. Tried everything. Glad to be home.
33472,Carp,2007-02-12 05:24:00,1488,"Sorry to hear the fish weren't co-operating the way you had hoped.  Guess with the slow bite there was time for other activities. Futon, cozy hut, dim lighting, romantic dinner. Was that hut a rockin' ???  Thanks for the report."
33539,snag,2007-02-12 14:36:00,1932,"You lucky bugger,  I think the only way I could get my wife out fishing in the winter would be very, very far down south!"
33552,DanTheMan,2007-02-12 15:11:00,257,"Eve though you got skunk, looks like a great trip.Looks like a nice set up also you had there.  Very nice romantic dinner you had there  :D  Great report and pics bud"
