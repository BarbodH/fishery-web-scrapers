Only a few 5-6 inchers here and there after that.  The nice 10+ inch fish that we did get were all in 15 fow on two different baits.  Shiner on a small hook and split shot, and maggots on a marmooska jig. Hopefully next time we can tangle with em for a couple more hours, but overall not too bad.  Pics are on a disposable as my digital batteries ran dry, freakin cold weather, so I wont have them for a while, sorry guys."
