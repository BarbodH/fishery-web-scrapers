33347,FinS,2007-02-11 21:47:00,463,2
33348,huntervasili,2007-02-11 21:49:00,1604,yup... 2 lines per person in the water...
33352,jeffw,2007-02-11 22:13:00,267,2 lines but all most all the lake trout lakes in the haliburton and minden area are one line only. I f you are not sure look in the regs for that particular lake and they will tell you if there is or not. Cheers Jeff

33423,huntervasili,2007-02-12 01:52:00,1604,WOW... 10 is alot... Interesting to see a group of 3 or four guys with 10 rods each in a school of fish eh...
33425,irishfield,2007-02-12 01:58:00,26272, Wouldn't change my success !
33434,Mike the Pike,2007-02-12 02:25:00,3421, 3 years ago I fished with an outfitter from Lac St.Pierre which is a very wide part of the St.Lawrence river 20 minutes from 3 rivers Quebec.According to the regulations there a fisherman can use 10 holes while ice fishing.The day I was there it was about -45 with the windchill .Maintaining 10 holes in those temps is alot of work.The holes froze after 30 seconds so I spent alot of time scooping the ice out.  Just take this weekend where we are aloud 5 holes.We missed many trout because we did not get to the tip up in time so in less they are hooked well you can miss alot of fish.Believe me 2 holes are enough I don't think more holes increases your catch.It just increases your workload.    This is the place and day I was talking about.  MTP.
33435,Spiel,2007-02-12 02:33:00,9065,"....As stated two is the norm throughout most of Ontario with exceptions. Personally I often tend to focus all my attention on one. It keeps me mobile (less work packing up and resetting) and often prevents the fish of the day from getting tangled in my second line, a real bummer if your angling alone."
