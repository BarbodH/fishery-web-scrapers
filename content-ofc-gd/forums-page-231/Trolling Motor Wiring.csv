858462,Matt Janes,2014-06-15 03:00:00,49,"So I just installed a new Minn Kota trolling motor plug and receptacle at the bow of my boat. There was already existing wiring and an existing receptacle but I couldn't find the plug to fit it.  Everything seemed good but when I went to run it, it ran for literally 2 seconds and then quit. Now all of the sudden there is no power to the receptacle anymore. Would there be an inline fuse installed somewhere between the front and the back of the boat?  It's 8 guage wire if that matters.  Thanks.  Matt"
858464,Paudash,2014-06-15 03:26:00,273,should be a fuse right at the battery connection or does it go through the main power switch on the console.  It may have a fuse in the the main fuse box at the console.  If it only ran ran for 2 seconds then it sounds like a fuse blew
858467,Matt Janes,2014-06-15 03:36:00,49,I will check to see if it goes to the console or just straight to the battery. Hopefully I don't have to change out the 8 guage for 6 guage...
858582,BillM,2014-06-15 20:01:00,17367,8 gauge should be fine... I'm guessing you popped a fuse somewhere.
858585,musky666,2014-06-15 20:09:00,126,"Circuit breaker most likely, needs to be reset, but the fact that it popped signals another problem I installed a MInn Kota 60 amp circuit breaker in my bow compartment with the batteries this spring. Used a new MK bow plug and 6 gauge wiring from bow plug to batteries, with crimped lug terminals- no issues so far. Your system 12 or 24 volt? make sure wise are run correctly if more than one battery. Mine run from red of trolling motor to positive on first battery, another cable from negative terminal of first battery to positive terminal of second battery, then black or negative cable from my Terrova to negative terminal of second battery."
858586,Matt Janes,2014-06-15 20:09:00,49,"Turned out it was a fuse. There were 2, 32 amp fuses back near the battery and one was blown. Hopefully they don't keep blowing! I will have to wait till next weekend to see..."
858590,Matt Janes,2014-06-15 20:14:00,49,12 Volt system.
858612,Lape0019,2014-06-15 23:06:00,647,Cut those out and buy a resettable one from minnkota. As stated before I think your motor is rated for a 45 or 50 amp but you can check that on the minnkota website. 32 amps is too small for that motor for sure even if there are two of them...
858634,BillM,2014-06-16 00:53:00,17367,"12V systems will run higher amperage, so yeah 32amp isn't going to cut it."
