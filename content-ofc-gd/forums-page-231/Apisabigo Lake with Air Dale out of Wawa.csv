857722,RickOnt,2014-06-11 19:54:00,669,"As soon as my 2013 trip was over I was searching for a place to go in 2014.I have 2 bucket lists#1 is the ""dreamers"" list and has spots like Plummers and the Tree#2 is more realistic, and after reading James Smedley's article in Ontario Out of Doors Apisabigo was added to this list.So when the opportunity came up to Fish a Spot from the ""List"" I quickly said ""Book me In""You know its gonna be a good week when the third cast produces a nice 16 incherThe cabin was great very well equipped, Propane lights that worked perfect, 2 Fridges, Indoor shower, 4 sets of single bunks, A gas and motor shed, 5 boats and 5 motors.The water system is gravity fed and there is a pump you just start up once or twice a week No priming just give it a pull.We caught fish all over and you did not need to go far This one was right from the dockPike were plentifulSome very nice Walleye alsoWe ate wellDinner for fourFish and ChipsWe had some rainBut then we had a rainbow!!Walleye were mostly caught on Jigs with a piece of worm. Best color tails were chartreuse, orange, pink and purple.Mepps #3 and #4 Black flurry also produced well.Shad Raps in bright colors cast or trolled caught there share.The big Pike were caught on Mepps #5 bucktailThe Walleye, I believe were post spawn, the males were not milking but had the remains of a dried milk sack.We never caught a fish deeper than 16'I tried Worm Harness and bottom bouncer but to my surprise they did not produceEven the bugs were minimal I bought a fancy new bug coat and never had it on once, You could even walk up the trail to the little house and sit and not get ate up!!!Once again Martin from Outpost Camps Inc was the best!!as promised the Sat phone and Generator were at the air base on our arrival.Another ""Great Memory""Thanks MartinMuch AppreciatedCheersRick"

857989,RickOnt,2014-06-12 23:16:00,669,"Hey Guys and Gals  It was a ""fun"" trip and thanks for reading  Mitch      We flew out of Wawa  TimRm  The hockey stick works the 'best' But I think I am dating myself with an aluminum Easton!!!  LOL  Sylvan   PM anytime  Bri    The Arrius is the first out of the rod locker here on Simcoe But because its a one piece I do not take it on Fly ins. Pilots are OK with one piece but the 2 piece pack much easier   Cheers Rick"
