858526,kickingfrog,2014-06-15 15:23:00,8333,"Aw heck, now even Lew is promoting products.  btw if Lew Said you had to stand on your head to catch musky I'd do it."
858537,captpierre,2014-06-15 16:37:00,2521,You mean you don't stand on  your head?

Wish I'd known you liked them so much as I don't use them anymore and gave a bunch away a couple years back, I could have sent them down to you."
858540,lew,2014-06-15 16:52:00,12766,"Aw heck, now even Lew is promoting products.  I have no problem promoting good gear Rob, I just wish I got paid for it"

It's sure been an incredible go to bait for you over the years that we've been fishing together.  Now to break your new PB."
858642,SuperDave,2014-06-16 01:40:00,204,Nice clean fish. Congrats on the PB. Those suicks are deadly in the right hands.

858404,ccmtcanada,2014-06-14 20:55:00,7971,"Fishnsled and I had planned to fish today.  We didn't know what we were going to target but we knew we wanted to get out and fish!  Because of the winds, we decided Lake O fishing was out so we decided on going for some Muskie in the Kawarthas.  With a cold front and 25km/h winds we were saying it may be a tough day out there.  We got to the launch at 8am and searched for some Muskie waters.  It was a chilly 8c!!  I was throwing my go to lure...a suick...when at around 820am as it's getting closer to the boat I see these huge jaws clamp around it!  I set the hook but somehow it didn't take...Fishnsled turned just in time to see the splash it made and it dove back for cover.  A few casts later, the lure had just hit the water....a few sweeps of the bait and BAM!!!  Another one hit.  This one was hooked well and it ended up beating my old 41.5"" PB.    This one beat my old PB by 1.5"" and came in at a solid 43""!   Here's the release shot...    A while later, Fishnsled gets on the board and does a quick release boat side...    Things slowed down after that and we were off the water by 2pm.  Always a great time fishing with you Fishnsled!!  Even better when we boat a few nice fish!"

858508,ccmtcanada,2014-06-15 13:45:00,7971,"Thanks everyone!  Was definitely a thrill to fight and land that fish!!!  The suick is my go to lure!  It's caught me more Muskies than anything else.   I told Will that if I ever lost it, I'd probably cry.  Lol"
858510,ccmtcanada,2014-06-15 13:47:00,7971,8 to 10 feet of water with some weed growth was where we had luck.  Hope you got a few!
858512,lew,2014-06-15 13:54:00,12766,"  The suick is my go to lure! It's caught me more Muskies than anything else. I told Will that if I ever lost it, I'd probably cry. Lol  Suicks are an old classic that work as well today as they ever did and the muskies never tire of them.  I remember taking a friend out a couple years ago who was new to musky fishing. I suggested a few baits to buy including a Suick. He tried everything and nothing worked so he put on his new Suick and got bit on the very 1st cast.  It then became one of his favorite musky baits"
858515,Handlebarz,2014-06-15 14:02:00,3790,Nice going Cliff congrats on the PB
