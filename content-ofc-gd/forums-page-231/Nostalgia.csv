Richmond Hill, Ontario, Yonge street between 16th ave and Major Mac facing east toward the David Dunlap Observatory.  Thought some of you might find it interesting.

858786,cheaptackle,2014-06-16 16:19:00,849,"What a difference!  I remember a field trip in school way way back when to the observatory and it seemed like a long ride in the country on the school bus from east end T.O.  Also, I seem to recall the observatory having said it would cease operations at one time - due to ""light pollution"" caused by urban sprawl.  That too was many years ago, the late 80's or early 90's.  Wonder if that's a reality now?  Michael"

858791,fishindevil,2014-06-16 16:45:00,6254,"Like the song says ""they paved paradise put up a parking lot "" !!!!!  Took all the trees put them in a tree museum,charged the people a dollar& a half just to see them !!!!  The good old urban jungle !! Nice comparison Joey !!! What a difference for sure"

Michael, I don't believe they really use it anymore, it's more of an education centre now."
858804,cheaptackle,2014-06-16 17:41:00,849,Thanks Chris!  I have at times wondered if it was even still there - the land must be in high demand I'm sure.  Michael
858806,grimsbylander,2014-06-16 17:42:00,3016,Wow. Those trees have grown!    Just kidding....that's an amazing contrast. I lived around Yonge and Maj Mac for a few years so I remember the area. The thing I notice is the lack if corn fields. You used to drive past huge corn fields when heading SOUTH from Richmond Hill.
858808,cheaptackle,2014-06-16 17:48:00,849,Just did a quick search on giggle - observatory seems to have closed for a while & reopened in '07 in full operation - lotsa events to go to.  Michael
858842,Joey,2014-06-16 20:55:00,9122,"Yes, the observatory is still open, but you can't just go up there.  You have to be part of a group.  I went up to take pictures and they kicked me off the land.  Said I was trespassing and that they'd have me arrested if I came back.  He even made me show him the bird pictures I had taken to prove that's all I was doing.  I called the ""owners,"" a big corporation, and asked permission and they also said no.  Said i was a liability and if I got hurt, they would be liable.  The other day I was just in the area, but not on the property, and saw the gate open and lots of people walking up there.  So I followed suit and the guy at the gate was nicer, said have a nice walk and he hoped I got some good pictures.  We had a chat on my way back and he said they were filming a movie there so that's why the gate was open.  I told him about the guy who kicked me out and he laughed.  He did mention that there were alot of coyotes (which I got pictures of before some of you may recall - but I was on the other side of the fence) and that there used to be 25 deer there, and they were down to 4 or 5, but up to about 25 coyotes now from a smaller amount.  Said they find the freshly killed deer carcasses all the time.  It won't matter soon, they've gotten permission to build there now, even though the original owner had a clause in his will that nobody was to ever built there.  Guess when you're dead, you can't complain"
