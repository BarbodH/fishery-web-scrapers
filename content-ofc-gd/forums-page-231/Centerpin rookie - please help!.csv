855013,Bill Shearer,2014-05-24 19:12:00,456,"I also do what Ralph says, but go one further. I always have my pouch on my wading belt, if it's not on the reel. After the fish is beached, netted or tailed, I always put the pouch on. Takes 10 seconds at most, and stops crud, ice, snow from getting into the clearances on the reel. This is especially good if fishing sandy areas."
855020,misfish,2014-05-24 19:46:00,29133,"As for drag,your finger or palm will be it. Small fish I will use my index finger. Bigger,I will palm the pin. I also wet my hand for comfort from getting skin burn. There are guys that will say lock it down and put the boots to the fish,but I like my rod to much to hear the snap. I play them all out.  Once you get use to your outfit,you will know when and when not to put pressure on the fish.  Im still a rookie learning as well. Just posting what works for me."
855021,Bill Shearer,2014-05-24 20:04:00,456,"Misfish brought up a good point, about drag on the reel. The size of your hands, the way your reel was designed, and how you hold the rod, all play a big part in landing the fish. Some reels like the Islander, have the spool very close to the reel foot. Others like the Anspec can have quite a gap between the spool and the reel foot. So if small handed person used an Anspec, he might use a longer finger to provide the drag. Conversely, a large handed person with an Islander might have difficulty applying drag with the larger fingers. I use a Kingpin,(which has a gap between the spool and the reel foot that is similar to the Anspec,) and apply drag with my little finger, and on larger fish pair it up with the ring finger. Works for my small hands. It all comes down to what you are comfortable with. Personally the index and second finger are the strongest on my hand, and using either of them for drag, leaves me holding the rod with less strength than using the little finger and ring finger. Some flows and some fish would test the limit for sure. I have developed what works for me over 30 years of pinning. It may not work for you at all. Get out and play with some carp, channel cats, bass- whatever. Now is the time to learn. And you don't have to worry about cold hands! Misfish mentioned that he wets his hand to stop from getting friction burns, when putting on the brakes of a hot fish. Works for him, and for me it spells disaster. My point is that you can read all kinds of pointers and opinions, but until you start doing it yourself, too much information is no help at all."
855023,misfish,2014-05-24 20:17:00,29133," Not sure where I said ""put the brakes on"". I use it as a comfort when putting drag on the reel."
855033,Bill Shearer,2014-05-24 21:55:00,456,"Sorry, I took this ""I also wet my hand for comfort from getting skin burn."" to  mean that heat, caused by friction from trying to slow a fishes run, or 'putting the brakes on', was why you wet your hand. Obviously I was mistaken."
855038,Ralph Field,2014-05-24 22:46:00,1018,"I don't put the pouch on my reel when landing a fish because I developed a wading staff with a rod holder built into the shaft, so when I land the fish my rod is put into the rod holder in my staff which is stuck in the ground. I,like Bill don't want to get any kind of crud into my reel by setting it down and I don't want myself or anyone else stepping on my rod."
855040,Bill Shearer,2014-05-24 23:00:00,456,"Great idea Ralph! Sooner or later we all develop ways to land  and protect the fish, and our equipment."

855228,landry,2014-05-26 16:19:00,1005,Bill is correct. As u get more comfy float fishing u will get a sense for what they will do next. Never palm the reel. Apply varying finger pressure as needed - go easy when they run or jump and apply more at other times... They r great fish fighting reels - way better than a spinning reel.
855229,bare foot wader,2014-05-26 16:34:00,1354,"I mostly apply drag to the line itself, not the spool, with my middle/ring fingers but I do palm the spool too...fingers or palming, you'll get a feel for it and learn not to lock the reel  biggest thing is keep your rod at a good angle, don't crazy high stick it, but do keep it bent, it's a 10-13' shock absorber, let it work for you  if you have any carp or catfish around you, that's great practice, you can bottom fish with a pin reel too, no rule that says you need to drift with a float"

859333,Miranda1,2014-06-19 00:06:00,3,"Hi Folks  First time posting on this forum, joined after doing some searching on the web for local (Ontario) centre pin sites. Looking for some guidance and recommendations from you on a good quality float rod. I started float fishing back in the mid 80s after returning from Europe where I lived for a while. Float and match fishing with long float type rods were the norm back then and once exposed to that type of fishing I was hooked. When I moved back to Canada I brought a couple of rods from Europe with me and purchased a nice float reel from Phil Clough when his dad released the original ""Clough"" float reel, I fished with it for a couple of seasons, the reel has been sitting in storage for years and at one point I actually thought of selling however in hindsight I'm glad I didn't.  I recently decided to get back into the sport, looking for a good quality rod to use with this reel so I would appreciate what is out there right now in terms of rods.  Thanks"
859393,BillM,2014-06-19 12:00:00,17367,"What's your budget?  Lots and lots of rods out there.  Also, you need to make sure you pair that Clough with something really nice  :)"
859450,Miranda1,2014-06-19 20:12:00,3,"Hi Bill  Thanks for the reply. I really haven't landed on a set budget, most of the Sage fly rods that I've accumulated over the years are on the higher end of the price scale so I would expect that float rods would be similarly priced. Ideally a multi section rod so that I can travel with it back to Europe in the mid-length range would be perfect."
859457,Bill Shearer,2014-06-19 20:39:00,456,"If you are looking for a rod that will fill your needs and be easily packed for carry-on, you will need to get a 4 pc, Spey conversion blank, custom built . There are many good options on the market. I have done a couple. Although not inexpensive, they are quality blanks, that befit your quality reel. Choose either a Sage ONE 6126, or Sage ONE 7136 blank, and get someone like Spiel on this forum to build it for you. He can provide some photos of each as well as prices. As always there will be other opinions on blanks and builds. What you decide to do is up to you."

854579,shaker,2014-05-21 20:48:00,23,"I just bought my first centerpin, an Okuma Aventa.  I've been fishing for steelhead with my spinning rod for 3 years and am feeling very comfortable reading the water and have been catching my share of fish, so I finally decided to try a pin.  I'm a bit nervous about trying it, but hope I'll catch on without too many problems.  I have a lot of questions and have been reading the forums which are helping immensely.  My first question is about line.  The guy at the store said I should use backing, but I've read mixed things about this.  Is it necessary?  If so, what kind and how much should I put on?  Also, how full should the spool be?  Also, hopefully this question isn't too stupid, is there any advantage to reeling with your left hand vs. right hand?  I've always used my right, but it seems I'm in the minority.  And if you have any advice for my first time out, please let me know.  Thanks.  "
854587,Bill Shearer,2014-05-21 21:16:00,456,"Backing saves you money, at the end of the day. I prefer dacron, since it is lighter than old mono, and does not absorb water like mono. It saves money because you put as much dacron on the spool as you need, then only add 200 yds/meters of mono to take it within 1/8"" of the lip of the spool. EVERY TIME YOU CHANGE LINE. If you usually reel with your right, it means that you are a left handed person to me. Why change? you probably will cast more accurately and further than you would with your right arm. Ergonomics. Welcome to the fold!"
854591,lew,2014-05-21 21:26:00,12766,"I've always used my right, but it seems I'm in the minority.  Don't worry about being in the minority, go with whatever the heck feels good to YOU."
854597,Ralph Field,2014-05-21 22:00:00,1018,"I'm in the minority, and never worry about it. Very few can ask me to test my gear. Follow floatman's advice and you will be fine."
854598,Canuck2fan,2014-05-21 22:02:00,1444,"I can say from experience that practice will make it a lot more fun when you hit a river with it. I went out with mine when I first purchased it a couple times and couldn't cast for crap with it. I was in a river with everybody else catching fish because they were able to place the float where it needed to be. I was determined not to have to go back to the car which was only 50ft away and revert to using a spinning reel setup because I had spent good money on a float reel. So after 2 trips where I wasn't getting fish when I should have been I went out in the field beside my apartment and practiced. It was great I saw about 10 friends who I fish with drive by and wave honk their horns and have a good laugh at my expense. I also managed to figure out what I was doing wrong.  Next trip out I was able to cast with a bit more precision and I caught fish, just as easily as I had with my spinning reel."
854640,shaker,2014-05-22 02:23:00,23,"Thanks guys. How important is it to fill the spool right up to the 1/8"" from the lip?"
854641,BillM,2014-05-22 02:27:00,17367,"Thanks guys. How important is it to fill the spool right up to the 1/8"" from the lip?  Not super duper important unless you're making long bomber casts where your distance will be affected.  As for line, stick to something simple like 8-12lb Trilene and utilize the side cast.   You'll get some line twist, but it's the easiest to learn.."

But just learning I would suggest just filling the reel with mono.  A spool of Raven is only $13.  Put backing on the next time you go to change the line.  JMO  Dan"
854708,shaker,2014-05-22 17:30:00,23,"My first outing with the new reel wasn't a total disaster but I have a lot of practicing to do.  Good news, no birds nests!  The bad news, I couldn't control where my float was going at all.  After a few years of figuring out how to read the water, I could not hit my spot or even come close.  More than half the time it landed less than 10 feet away from me.  Needless to say, no fish.  Also, my wrist got really tired so I must be holding the rod incorrectly or something.  Thanks Dan on your line filling suggestion, that is what I had done so I don't feel like I'm doing anything majorly wrong on that, but I will go to backing eventually since that's what most of you are saying.  I'll keep at it and maybe post and update in case anyone cares"
854723,Bill Shearer,2014-05-22 18:20:00,456,"When you spend the time to learn any skill, (doesn't matter if its casting a CP, or a spinning reel or tying a new knot) repetition and paying attention to the small details, all help. I don't know one person that learned how to cast a Centerpin in a single outing. So enjoy the journey."
854732,bare foot wader,2014-05-22 19:01:00,1354,"as for casting and float control...practice, practice, practice...summer time carp will get you ready for fall in no time  with the wrist thing...how/where is the reel mounted? sliding rings or fixed seat? if sliding, try adjusting where the reel sits  when I first started out it seemed like everybody mounted the reel closer to the butt, which does not work for me...so eventually I just did what felt most comfortable for me, and mounted my reel slightly forward of the center point on the handle....I've since had a few custom rods built with a balancing weight system in the butt, I had right hand issues and having a rod that was overall heavier, but balanced made a huge difference"
854734,misfish,2014-05-22 19:28:00,29133,"Dont be afraid to ask while your out there on the banks. When I started I was horrible. BillM made a trip with me and got me started on the casting. Then I hooked up with a fella on the river which showed me the ins and outs. Im  a side caster. To help prevent line twists, I run a micro 3 barrel swivel. It helps"
854737,Bill Shearer,2014-05-22 19:38:00,456,"^ Very valid points made by bfd! Balance is one of the keys to comfort. I might add that how you hold the rod also makes a huge difference as well. If your wrist is sore, you need to let the portion of the rod behind the reel rest under and against your forearm. Trying to hold all that weight with your wrist will result in severe tendonitis/ carpal tunnel issues. I might add that when it comes time to be setting hooks, or lifting the rod for retrieval of line after every drift, sore shoulders and elbows can be a result. I'm speaking from experience here. (I've had several cortisone shots over the years) Golfers and Tennis players have similar issues when they try and overcome technique or equipment issues with their bodies.  I'd recommend that you talk to, and observe CP anglers while fishing. I once sat back and watched a guy so long on the stream that he became concerned for his well being! lol. I then divulged my reasons for watching him, and he was very helpful; thanks!"

854890,shaker,2014-05-23 18:37:00,23,"If anyone's interested...my Day 2 update:  My casting has really improved thanks to some of your tips (see below).  I've been trying the side cast and Wallis cast and am hitting my spot maybe 75% of the time.  I know that means I still have lots of practicing to do, but compared to yesterday I'm pretty happy.  Still no fish though, but that may be a blessing in disguise, as I can focus on practicing my casts.  I moved the reel away from the butt and that made such a huge difference, I can't thank you guys (bare foot wader and floatman especially) enough for that advice.  While I'm at it I might as well add another stupid question.  When I use backing (which I'm not now, but will eventually), how do I connect it to the main line?"
854893,bare foot wader,2014-05-23 19:06:00,1354,"glad to hear it, if you're not comfortable you're not going to fish as focused or as long  many different knots to connect to mainline, somewhat depends on the type of backing you use...for myself I have most confidence with an improved Albright, easy to tie and goes through guides easily  I like to use 20 lb Dacron, but mono and cheap fly line are also popular...I probably fill up more Dacron than most, I do a good 2/3 to 3/4 of the spool with Dacron to take up space, and I only run about 100 yds of mainline...I like to fish fresh mainline, fresh handles better, plus it's more expensive than Dacron and don't really need a half spool of it...when a fish runs into my backing, I have complete trust in my Albright knot, and on most ON rivers it's highly unlikely to let a fish get more than 100 yds out on you  how you hold the rod/reel was also very solid advice, my butt is usually tucked under my arm pit/against ribs, kind of acts as an anchor point when I set the hook....and under the forearm when you're extending your arm for more reach, little things to reduce the strain on your hand and wrist....try different hand positions until you find what you like"
854901,Bill Shearer,2014-05-23 19:46:00,456,"Lots of different ways to utilize the backing.I tape the end of the backing to the bare spool with masking tape. Then wind on the Dacron till there is a little less than 1/4"" of room on the spool. Then I tape down the end again. No need to tie the backing to the mono, since you will never get to it while fishing. This eliminates trying to cover knots, and it keeps the bed of the spool smooth. Then you just tie on the mono with an arbor knot, and wind on 250-300 yds of mono. I've been doing it this way for a few years. Works well for me and others I've mentioned it to.I should add that I use 50lb kite string as backing. I bought a 3000 ft spool for $20 a few years ago. I've done many reels, and still have enough left for a few more. The 50 lb fills up the spool faster, and is easy to keep level when winding on.Price is up from three years ago.Try here;https://goodwinds.com/line-winders/braided-dacron.html"

Soon I'm hoping to land some fish with my new setup (I guess that goes without saying).  I landed my share with my spinning setup and it was relatively easy with the drag etc. but I'm sure it's going to be a whole different animal with the centerpin.
