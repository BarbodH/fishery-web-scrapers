859135,cheaptackle,2014-06-18 00:28:00,849,High tech looking ain't it?  Ya need a license to run that?  I gotta 20 walmart thingy that takes a paper filter & folger's - don't look nothing like that at all.  Not an espresso fan myself but that sure looks like it'd get the job done right!  Michael
859143,adempsey,2014-06-18 01:19:00,1498,It's a boy!  Lol.   Lookin good!   Probably should stop buying Starbucks and saving up for something like that myself.  Can't beat a good Cafe Americano.

After years of only drinking green tea in the morning, I'm starting to switch back to coffee...making it at home for the first time using a $5 french press. Best part of my coffee is the homemade maple syrop shot I add to each cup"
859169,DRIFTER_016,2014-06-18 02:38:00,10439,I think a trip to Yellowknife is in order.  The giant troots and poike have nothing to do with it huh Bill? P.S. My old grinder is still good and the espresso machine has been repaired and is ready for camping and cottage duty. Think I'll haul it out to the lease this weekend so I don't have to go without.
859171,BillM,2014-06-18 02:43:00,17367,Nothing to do with giant snakes and greasers at all!
859172,DRIFTER_016,2014-06-18 02:44:00,10439,Nothing to do with giant snakes and greasers at all!  Didn't think so.
859191,solopaddler,2014-06-18 09:02:00,8605,"Nothing to do with giant snakes and greasers at all!  It's all about the coffee for me, fish are secondary.  Here's my new morning duo.  "
