858989,steelhunter,2014-06-17 16:28:00,81,What you don't hear and I heard this from a Mnr officer last week in aurora is that when they are convicted of their charge they have to pay court. time too this can add to 1000's on top of what the fine is. They can not release this information because it is not part of the offence they were charged with.

858995,Jds63,2014-06-17 16:55:00,1365," This kind of statement needs to be challenged absolutely , directly and immediately whenever it occurs....YES....STEREOTYPING HAPPENS FOR A REASON.....IT HAPPENS BECAUSE PEOPLE HOLD IGNORANT BELIEFS AND ATTITUDES LIKE YOURS TO BE SELF EVIDENT TRUTHS!  Are you defending people stereotyping other people? Even if 99% of the people there were 'not born in Canada' ( how the heck you could possibly know that I dont know) Asian and Russian....you sure about that? How do you know?  As for garbage left lying around at popular fishing spots....it happens at every popular fishing spot I have ever frequented, suppose those 'Russians and 'Asians' should feel ashamed for that too....What the heck is an 'Asian' anyway?  I dont usually get involved in stuff like this cuz it makes me so mad, but I see so much going on recently I cannot stay silent any longer...screw it...the gloves are off!  I just wish  was more eloquent and articulate in these types of discussions....it does not help that i get really mad!  All the best  Limeyangler.  PS...until you speak to me and know all the cultural influences in my life you can never accurately define who or what I am...and I will always reserve the right to define myself anyway...so stereotype away...but you are wrong!  (Born in Toronto to  Nigerian+Danish biological parents,  adopted by English and Grenadian parents, schooled and lived in in Canada, England, Sweden, Italy and the Netherlands)  I agree 100% with you Simon .... Its funny how there are so many MNR busts in northern Ontario for illegal poaching but hardly ever mentioned ... oh yeah thats because they are not visible minorities so you can't blame some ethnic group for that ..."
858998,Headhunter,2014-06-17 17:06:00,5703,"Well, I completely disagree with the above statement. I can most confidently say that should someone be caught poaching in the north and we hear about it, I can say without question that everyone here would applaud the MNR as well as any fines the guilty receive. Issues in the south get more attention simply because there are more of us here, than there. I would hazard a guess that most here would applaud ANY efforts to support our fisheries... HH"
859013,Sinker,2014-06-17 19:09:00,8692,"Whaaatever!!  Nobody is blaming any ethnic groups for all poaching. Its just common knowledge that some ethnic groups are known to keep more than their share of fish, smaller fish, and any species of fish. I have no problem with any person catching a limit and taking it home to eat, I do it all the time, but for some reason there are certain ethnic groups who keep everything caught, and are ignorant to the regulations and other fisherman. I'm not pointing fingers, and I don't have to, because I'm sure everyone here reading this understands what I'm saying, yourself included.  Are there other ethnic groups who do this? Hell yeah.....  Are they as common?? NOPE!!  Sorry to burst your bubble.  S."

858701,jbailey,2014-06-16 12:47:00,866,"SCUGOG -- Two men were fined a combined $4,000 after they were found with more than 100 black crappie in their boat following a day of fishing on Lake Scugog. The two men, one from Markham and another from Scarborough, were found to be keeping 105 black crappie alive when they were investigated by two Ministry of Natural Resources conservation officers on May 2. The anglersâ€™ licences only permitted them to possess a combined total of 60 black crappie, putting them 45 fish over the legal limit. On June 4, Hongrui Mei of Markham and Li-En Zhou of Scarborough pleaded guilty and were each fined $2,000 for catching and retaining more than the legal limit of black crappie. The case was heard by Justice of the Peace Duncan Read in the Ontario Court of Justice, Whitby. The MNR reminds anglers that it is an offence to transport live fish, other than baitfish, and that fishing limits are in place to maintain a sustainable fishery. For more information on fishing regulations, visitwww.ontario.ca/fishing.   Possibly selling them to a restaurant? hmm"
858702,cram,2014-06-16 12:53:00,1733,Should have fined them 4000 each. Or 5x as much.
858704,BillM,2014-06-16 13:00:00,17367,Those two definitely aren't helping the stereotype.
858709,Headhunter,2014-06-16 13:04:00,5703,I wonder if the MNR also checked out their freezers at home? HH

How much fish can two people eat? I have fish at least once a week no matter what, and feed 3 people.....I don't freeze much fish, but I do try to stock up on panfish in the spring, but there is absolutley no need to keep more than the legal limit unless your eating fish every day, and feeding a massive family......or your selling them.....

You will also know its covered in a pile of garbage. Forgive me for sounding that way, it was wrong for me to say it like that.

858954,akaShag,2014-06-17 13:14:00,2073,"I think TimRM may have been inflicted by that terrible ailment called Political Correctness.  In assuming that the poachers may be something other than white anglers, and assuming that non-white anglers would somehow be treated differently under the law because of their non-whiteness, then of course the actions of the poachers are completely forgiveable.  In this type of thinking, people who did not grow up in Ontario (and these folks may be twelfth generation Canadians, we do not know, right?), anyways non-Ontario born anglers can't POSSIBLY be expected to know OUR laws and follow OUR rules, because you see they may have different customs, and such.  They probably grew up so poor that they HAVE to keep every fish they catch, they can't help themselves.  And other codswallop like that.  Apologists for criminals can always find ""REASONS"" for their views.  So yes, suggesting these poachers did not get a fair hearing effectively suggests that TimRM thinks the judge is racist.  Which I personally doubt very much.  JMOYMV"
