Any suggestions of where to start out or where carp are known to frequent? I'm going to be staying right by Craigleith in Collingwood, would prefer not to venture too far but will in order to hook into a few pigs. Any help would be apprecaited.  Cheers, Phil  "

859040,Ironfish,2014-06-17 21:10:00,2,Thanks gentleman. I'll give it a go.  Also what else swims in the Harbor? Any perch or blue gill? I'll be taking a 6 year old out with me whos trying out fishing for the first time. I want him to have a positive experience.
