858480,OhioFisherman,2014-06-15 05:35:00,6623,"The hook point rides up, no rotation, a keel shaped head also prevents it."
858486,Gerritt,2014-06-15 08:42:00,6129,"Used to use them up on buckhorn years ago, they were deadly tipped with a night crawled"
858500,Paudash,2014-06-15 12:50:00,273,"used them for years in Pigeon, boring lure to use but they were always effective."
858599,DOS,2014-06-15 21:43:00,119,"Tip it with half a worm,  one of my favorite lures,  all red or red and white.."
858600,Parnelly,2014-06-15 21:47:00,108,Yep the half worm tipped works well on Rice too. We were pulling them out of the weeds with the chartreuse color tipped with a worm.
858997,forgop,2014-06-17 17:05:00,9,Any secrets to knowing how deep they go when trolling?
859000,Hooked,2014-06-17 17:30:00,891,"I had a hard time slow trolling them, seemed the blade would not rotate.  That was the only issue I found with them.  I know guys would jig with them too with success on Rice."
859001,jimmer,2014-06-17 17:34:00,2730,They twist your line like crazy. Troll them using a baitcaster.
