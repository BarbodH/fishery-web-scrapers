858848,ccmtcanada,2014-06-16 21:09:00,7971,Hey everyone!  I have a good friend who is looking for a good bass/walleye/pike lake with campsites.  It doesn't have to be a provincial park with all the amenities.  It can even be crown land.  He also has a boat and can haul his gear to an island or boat access site only.  The only ask is that it's within a 3 hour drive of Toronto.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks!
858853,DRIFTER_016,2014-06-16 21:22:00,10439,I spent a lot of time chasing fish and camping in the Honey Harbour area. â€‹Great camp sites on Beausoliel Island in Georgian Bay Islands National Park.  ;)

858882,BillM,2014-06-17 00:16:00,17367,French River or the delta would probably be a good bet.  The middle French has some amazing views and little to no boat traffic.
858884,SirCranksalot,2014-06-17 00:23:00,3291,I know a lake just past P Sound that has lots of bass and crown land camping. Not going to name it here--PM if interested.

859134,farsider,2014-06-18 00:27:00,456,"I would echo backbay comments about Mass. PP.  We have always done well there for Pike and Bass and being on GB there is always the potential for Musky or others.  There is lots of water, backbays, etc. to explore and fish with little other boat traffic.  Cheers, Mark"
859222,highdrifter,2014-06-18 13:32:00,2534,"I'd check out Balsam Prov Park..  I've stayed there before and was impressed.  Stayed at a friend's cottage just to the left of the park last weekend.  Great location within 2 1/2hrs of Toronto.  Nice clean beach, a good launch..  and the fishing ain't bad either!  I'd sneak out for the morning fish and got some nice eyes, pikes and a coupla lunges as well.."
859232,ccmtcanada,2014-06-18 15:08:00,7971,Awesome suggestions guys!  Thanks!
859345,MuskieWannabe,2014-06-19 01:04:00,79,Elephant and Baptiste Lakes....Not sure if within 3 hours but both good lakes I have had great success at.
