859405,Court R,2014-06-19 12:52:00,213,"I recently purchased a gold card for my Humminbird unit and I see that all the contour line are way off , at times it shows im on shore, any ideas?"
859406,BillM,2014-06-19 13:01:00,17367,"You probably have to play with the map offset on the unit.   I had to do something similar to mine.   GPS isn't as accurate as people would like to believe  Find a well known spot on the map (An island or hump, etc) then make the adjustment."
859407,Gerritt,2014-06-19 13:03:00,6129,"To add to the previous suggestion, make sure you have the correct region selected for the card itself for the area you are fishing. As elevation etc will be off if not selected properly.  G"
859408,Consigliere,2014-06-19 13:12:00,121,"You may need to do some GPS diagnostics as well.  Make sure you are locked into lots of satellites to improve accuracy.  Google how to do this, there is a special way to do it that I can't recall right now.  Could be that map for that lake is not great, try updating maybe?"
859409,BillM,2014-06-19 13:13:00,17367,"He's got a GPS/Satellite screen on that HB which will tell him how many he's connected to, etc..   I don't think this is a GPS issue, almost every map I've had needed some sort of correction so it's dead on.   Also gotta remember some of these maps are extremely old, a lot of them are from the same 50 year old hydrocharts."
859410,Court R,2014-06-19 13:41:00,213,"Ok will look in to that stuff guys, thanks."
