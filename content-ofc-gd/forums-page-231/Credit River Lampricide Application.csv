Lampricide will be applied for approximately 14 hours from a point on the river near the municipality of Cheltenham, but will take several days to reach Lake Ontario.Assessment studies will be conducted prior to the treatment to determine the upstream distribution of larvae, which may reduce the length of river treated.Timing of the treatment is dependent upon streamflow and weather conditions, and is tentatively scheduled for the period between June 19-23, 2014.Lampricide selectively kills Sea Lamprey larvae, but may also result in the death of other fish that are weakened by disease, spawning or other environmental factors. Although lampricide is not harmful to humans or other animals at the concentrations used during treatment, any use of stream water for irrigation and drinking should be suspended for a 24-hour period during the treatment.The Sea lamprey is an invasive species in the Great Lakes. Since the 1950’s, DFO’s Sea Lamprey Control Centre has worked under an international agreement with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission towards the delivery of effective Sea lamprey control in the Great Lakes.For more information contact:Sea Lamprey Control CentreFisheries and Oceans Canada1219 Queen St. East, Sault Ste.
