858824,Jon,2014-06-16 19:49:00,209,Canadian rules for flying the flag:  http://www.pch.gc.ca/eng/1359048153800/1359048247377  Not sure if this is the law or just a guideline.  Jon
858826,Pikeslayer8,2014-06-16 19:56:00,336,"As an American, I also find this very disrespectful to the home country.  Morons."
858829,misfish,2014-06-16 20:09:00,29133,"At the main plant,we have three flag poles. The Canadian one is always on the middle one and the highest. When we have visitors,their flags are flown on the other two. Germany,USA,China where ever they are from."
858833,Lunatic,2014-06-16 20:31:00,536,thats not right at all.
858843,Terry,2014-06-16 21:01:00,14456,it's not right tell me where it is and I will burn the place down   with them in it yeah that will show them  I am not that concerned about that not high on my list of concerns
858939,Fish Farmer,2014-06-17 11:57:00,2234,"As an American, I also find this very disrespectful to the home country.  Morons. Thank You Pikeslayer8, I like wise."
858986,Thrilla,2014-06-17 15:46:00,164,"I try not to let little things bother me personally... This would be an example, who cares how he wants to fly his flag? mind your own business and worry about your flag?"
858703,Fish Farmer,2014-06-16 12:58:00,2234,"This picture was taken on Sister Island on Big Gull Lake, Ontario Canada. Can you see anything wrong? I Did.     How many years will it be OK and Official? My Quote, (The End Is Coming)"
858705,BillM,2014-06-16 13:00:00,17367,Reverse the flags and everyone can be happy.
858707,bushart,2014-06-16 13:02:00,2628,Tells me that beer and flag raisin don't mix
858714,cheaptackle,2014-06-16 13:09:00,849,"I'm not 100% sure but isn't it a federal offence to fly another flag above the Canadian flag?  Pretty sure it's the same south of the border too.  Wonder if these might be american ""sunbirds"" summering up here and just don't know any better?  Michael"
858716,BillM,2014-06-16 13:10:00,17367,"That settles it, burn the cottage down.  It's the only solution."
858721,Tybo,2014-06-16 13:15:00,1373,It`s ok. The American flag is up side down.?
858724,lew,2014-06-16 13:19:00,12766,"Don't know if it signifies the end of anything Dave, but it's not right.  Something I've seen that's much worse is a waterfront home on the Quebec side of the Ottawa River where a guy  flies the Canadian flag upside down on a regular basis. I haven't been there for a couple years but I did see it several years in a row."
858725,Fish Farmer,2014-06-16 13:19:00,2234,"Wish I could have taken the picture the day it was windy, didn't have my camera, it wasn't upside down."
858731,Tybo,2014-06-16 13:32:00,1373,Dave A upside down US flag means DISTRESS.
858733,BillM,2014-06-16 13:35:00,17367,I'm out of beer!  QUICK FLIP THE FLAGS!
858736,lew,2014-06-16 13:43:00,12766,Dave A upside down US flag means DISTRESS.  It can also mean disrespect for the country the flag represents Paul.

You have certain first amendment rights, freedom of speech.  It maybe a bit disrespectful? Aren't there more important issues in both of our countries to take issue with?"
858741,bushart,2014-06-16 13:52:00,2628,C'mon Art---If I told ya once.. I told ya million times  When raisin a flag...half hitch man...half hitch....jeeez
858742,Gallie,2014-06-16 13:52:00,1215,Im pretty sure most people can take issue with many things big and small at the same time. I find it disrespectful.

Aren't there more important issues in both of our countries to take issue with? I'm personally not taking issue - I was merely curious on whether it was a point of law purely from an interest point of view.  I agree we've more important topics perhaps, but this post was titled ""see anything wrong"" which to me is asking for input, perhaps to confirm the OP's own thoughts or to hear if it is an issue.  Never hurts to ask and learn.  Michael"
858755,Dave Bailey,2014-06-16 14:37:00,1641,"Protocol, but not law (as far as I know), says that on Canadian soil, the Canadian flag flies higher than any other on a group. And putting both flags on the same staff is, well, tacky."
858758,DanD,2014-06-16 14:41:00,2223,I bet it would be a concern if things were turned around with the Canadian flag on top and the cabin was on US soil. I’m pretty sure we’d have to deal with the American second amendment of the constitution and we’d be warring Kevlar suits.  Dan.
858759,bushart,2014-06-16 14:44:00,2628,Just as long as a Leafs flag was'nt higher
858760,OhioFisherman,2014-06-16 14:47:00,6623,"LOL Dan! For some of the wackos here it probably would be a concern, some of those people seem to think Canada is a socialist country.  Is it wrong to own property in both and love both countries? A degree of respect should be observed though, love the one you're with enough to put their flag on top?"
858763,big guy,2014-06-16 14:51:00,414,"Ya, the canoe should upside down so it won't get filled with rain water"
858764,Gallie,2014-06-16 14:51:00,1215,"No its not wrong, you should show respect to the country you are in though."
