858555,Musky or Specks,2014-06-15 18:08:00,2710,It's great fishing for pike and walleye. Slow trolled worm harnesses was the key for us. Pike as all places up north hit any and everything.
858632,pikeyminnow,2014-06-16 00:40:00,18,"We stopped there are on our way out west for a night last June and the hordes of black flies pretty near carried us away. My wife wouldn't even come out of the trailer although she isn't a real bush person anyway. I did talk to a couple of guys who said the fishing was excellent, if you could put up with the flies."
858672,Dan668,2014-06-16 03:49:00,1120,"My uncle used to go their a lot. Said the fishing was excellent. But, out of every park he's been to in Ontario, for flies, he said it was hands down the worst. Like the previous poster mentioned.  I was going to make it down their one year, i thought it was one of the parks shut down a few years ago. Guess not. Post a report when you come back."
