693953,bushart,2012-05-07 20:16:00,2628,There's no fish over there  I've caught some nice eyes over the years in Bark--big smallies as well
694112,skidoosafari,2012-05-08 02:27:00,46, Have to agree with bushart. Nofish in hay/drizzle or bark lakes. When I get some time I will pm ya some info
694116,solopaddler,2012-05-08 02:33:00,8605,You're also right on the doorstep of Algonquin Park as well. And everyone knows there's no fish there either.
694124,woodenboater,2012-05-08 03:08:00,2277,well not without a canoe eating 5km carry at least
694130,mirogak,2012-05-08 03:35:00,387, I can attest to that
695658,Bigfoot2,2012-05-12 22:32:00,12," House is bought, boat is bought, and you almost gave me a heart attack,,,till I saw the sarcasm sign. Any info would be appreciated, but if nothing else they look like beautiful lakes. Glad I am getting the electric motor too for some quiet motoring.  Cheers."

I've been fishing Algonquin for the past 4 years (middle of august) and have absolutely no luck on the trout lakes.  Went to a lake which I was told had smallies, but all I got were rock bass (gross).  Are there any bass/walleye/pike in Galeairy?  I'd really like the kids to catch something this year.  They got quite frustrated last year fishing all day and coming up with a few rock bass and sunfish Thanks in advance. Chris."
