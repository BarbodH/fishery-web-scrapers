Copy of DSCF1372.JPG   So your sayin ya need fertilizer for the garden??  Actually muskie is the one species I've never sought---caught a few incidentally but never targeted  Fishin willys one day years ago on Wabigoon----hot summer day--dead flat and calm---had a monster come up and roll beside the boat---and kept rollin---had to be well over 50lbs---huge fish
