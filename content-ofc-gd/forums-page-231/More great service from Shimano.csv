859041,lew,2014-06-17 21:10:00,12766,"I'm heading north on Saturday for a 7 day musky trip and wanted to be sure my #1 reel, a Calcutta TE 400, was working as good as possible so I dropped it off at Shimano in Peterboro Friday afternoon.  They just called to say it's all ready.  It was completely stripped down & cleaned in some sort of bath, reassembled with new drag washers and lubricated and made like new again.  All for $30  Pretty impressive in my books.  "

859104,BillM,2014-06-17 22:46:00,17367,"I gotta send in my reels, why I didn't in the off season is beyond me"
859105,lew,2014-06-17 22:54:00,12766,I meant to take this one in earlier too and totally forgot about it till Friday. I was worried they couldn't do it in time but they really came through for me.

I was worried they couldn't do it in time but they really came through for me.  Must have been your smile.  If I lived closer I'd take some of mine in. I've got a TE that's not as smooth as a B and a Curado that could use some professional tlc.
