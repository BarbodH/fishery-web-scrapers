857646,grimsbylander,2014-06-11 11:55:00,3016,You're stating the obvious. Targeting OOS fish is illegal and whether you've been fishing 4 days or 4 decades it's still illegal. We all agree. Now pay attention...the issue is the grey area when you're fishing for one LEGAL species in a way that others PERCEIVE as you targeting the OOS fish. To imply that there are no common angling techniques between species or that people don't make irrational judgements is as near-sighted as believing people don't target OOS fish.

857878,Old Ironmaker,2014-06-12 15:51:00,8243,"I haven't gotten into this. I have Smallmouth spawn and bed right in front of my place. They are still on the beds. Grimsbylander, they will not only hit those baits, at times they will hit anything that moves. They were on the beds in 92 for opening and we were having a few pops on the deck. I made a bet they would hit a cigarette butt. Put 1 on a hook with a splitshot, I won the bet.  Both males and females are very aggressive at this time of their spawn cycle. The hens are on a post spawn feed and are overly aggressive.  What do we do this year when the Bass are still on the beds and legally take them? We are not going to wipe out an entire generation taking a bass off it's bed for the time it takes to land and release it, or even keep it. There are more than a dozen beds within the 75 feet of shore I have here, and those are only the beds I can see from the deck. There are millions of beds on this lake based on those we have right out front.  I've fished for many species both fresh and saltwater on more than a few continents. If I was told I could only fish for 1 species for the rest of my life my choice without even thinking twice would be Lake Erie Smallmouth, hands down the best fish pound for pound anywhere in the world. If I want to reel in a log, Walleye, heck Freshwater Water Drum outfight that lazy fish. I don't know about Musky I've never had the pleasure. King Salmon are up there for sure, as well as big Steelhead. But give me a Bass or give me death."

858286,dhickey,2014-06-14 03:54:00,1038,The next question ...  If the bass are still on their beds after opener would you target them??  I would not and have switched over to pike in the past.  Going after bass defending their fry is like shooting fish in a barrel (shame on you) Accidental catches while fishing for other species is common but you as a responsible angler need to decide what's rite based on your moral disposition.

857515,cityfisher,2014-06-10 18:46:00,959,Good discussion Guys!  I was at the cottage the last 4 days. Only witnessed one account of Obvious bass fishing. One guy in a kayak throwing spinner baits in one of the ussuall spawning ground.  I trolled an hour or 2 a day and only pulled up 4 eyes for my efforts. Only one OOS bass over 24fow too.  Only thing we can do is call people out on it and then they have to make the decision themselves.
857521,Dan668,2014-06-10 19:38:00,1120,"Spinnerbaits can be used for anything. I was on balsam Sunday, fishing weedlines away from shore and managed pike in the double digits, a few musky, perch and bluegill (surprised me) and 4 walleye over the slot (all released, don't keep or eat fish). Only one OOS brute smallie.  When its a cloudy day with some or little chop, spinnerbaits are my favourite lures for walleye, same with lipless cranks. They just flat out catch them."

Is a beatdown worth telling a stranger not to fish for bass before a date? Call MNR it is there job not yours to be judge and jury on this issue. If they do not respect the law what makes you think they will respect you?  Be safe and be careful I hate for any of my friends to be injured over a fish is my point.   Art
857592,dhickey,2014-06-11 01:25:00,1038,Lets just step back for a second. Fishing OOS fish in Canada is illegal . Whether its for herring on Simcoe /bass on a back lakes /musky/walleye /lacers/whiteys/pike Or any thing else you want to fish for the plain fact is that if you have any knowledge you set up your gear for the fish you are seeking.? Given that. It becomes imperative to set your gear up in order to TARGET whatever species  your fishing for....  As it states in the regs.....  MNR looks for that.....  So the Key may lie in education? Or what about a graduated licence?? Start as 1 of any species and go from there?  I have fished  since I was 4 yrs old I am 48 at the end of June I would pass any test no problem....  As for taking things into your own hands go for it . But educate them instead of threaten them....?  Canada has fought hard for conservation over the past 30yrs .....  RESPECT IT....  Don..    If you choose to ignore what responsible ANGLERS respect .   THEN SHAME ON YOU.   KISS IT............
857613,grimsbylander,2014-06-11 03:07:00,3016,"A graduated fishing license??? You're kidding right? A few jerks break the law, just like any other laws that get commonly broke and out come the cowboys to form a linch mob and those ready to make more unenforceable laws."

Yes this is unfortunate, I catch a lot of pike using a spinnerbait White or White or Cht and I get some OOS Bass.  Basically some of the lures overlap, I'm not intentionally targeting them and I do my best to keep my colors more geared to what I think Pike traditionally will strike more than a bass...but I still catch that OOS fish, I don't take pictures I quickly unhook and release them when that happens.

I also know when and where the fish are.(I think)  Based on 40yrs of fishing along with the experience of endless days of fishing.  And yes.........

857630,fishindevil,2014-06-11 07:37:00,6254,So because I'm fishing a weed edge 20ft from someone's dock with a jig someone might think I'm fishing oos bass !!!! That's a joke as most of my walleyes this spring have come from spots like that !!!! So sometimes it's just idiots that assume you are fishing oos bass !!!! And I have even left fishing spots as I have had some big bass follow my bait and I have purposely pulled the bait away from them as not to catch them !!! So again it's sometimes that just because the know it all guy thinks you are fishing for bass oos it's them that really have no clue !!!!! Which is typical !!!!!! So it does work both ways

Walleye can be found via ripping reeds, jerkbaits and jigging not just long lining like you stated.  You probably are right and they are targeting bass as you know the waters better than I do.  Take some notes of the boat, numbers and towing vehicle and report.  Its all you can do.  You start slashing tires and getting into confrontations and you could end up on the wrong side of a beating.  Not worth it for a bass."

I fish crappie and pike in shallow bays, fish pickerel and pike in waters that smallmouth frequent and catch a fair share of all species including some bass that don't happen to be in season. I don't flip docks, I don't throw tubes or senkos, but I still catch the damn things every trip out. To me bass are a species of last resort that I will only fish for if nothing else is doing. I just can't get stressed if some dude wants to target a fish that would bite a beer can with hooks.

If you held their heads under water for the same time that the ""special TV hosts"" hold fish out of water to garner some photos and blah, blah blah, etc, then maybe they would come to realize you're suffocating the fish.  Depriving it of water to get O2 through their gills and remain in their neutral buoyant state to keep their innards in the right place.  Maybe Magilla Gorilla should hold them horizontal by the jaw and see how they like it.  Anyway, OOS catching and photographing seems to be an annual event and rant, something the common nitwits don't grasp."
857010,Terry,2014-06-07 01:40:00,14456,"i have read that the pan fish that eat bass fry will sit all day picking one off here and another one there till they get their fill,then they stop feeding till they are hungry again or the female is pulled from the bed and they get their fill and they stop eating till they are hungry again but at the end of the day they do eat about the same amount of fry.. inany given  lake the pan fish will get their food if not from one bed then another, so many people believe c&r at spawning time has little effect, many US states seem to prove it with year round open season on bass and they still have great bass fishing, look at all the other fish that have open season during spawn with no ill affects so as long as the season is closed I will not fish for them, but if it opened up, I would be there fishing for them"

857081,Steve,2014-06-07 19:12:00,2075,"vigilante justice is never the answer but at least in Canada you can rest assure that most all of the people you confront will not pull out a pistol and shoot you. In the US there is a certain amount of courtesy that is unspoken because of our gun laws and truth be told I like it. It cuts down on people who are having a bad day making a ""cause"" the adrenaline spike of the day.   Art  Wow.  Courtesy should be something that is earned, or you show out of respect, not offered ""in case they have a gun""."

857086,moxie,2014-06-07 19:39:00,1566,Its a shame but I guess people will do what they do. I bet there will be even more Idiots that will be voting lieberal next week though.
857088,dhickey,2014-06-07 19:42:00,1038,Are they allowed to carry a gun in Canada when fishing?? I don't think so?  And yes bass fishing does teach you how to target kinda like hunting.  Hunting for fish??? Or hunting for deer???  Different methods/tools same goal..... (catch and release is the only difference)  Respect that...  Don.
857090,misfish,2014-06-07 19:59:00,29133,"Its a shame but I guess people will do what they do. I bet there will be even more Idiots that will be voting lieberal next week though.  Who dat?????????LOL   Don    Caught me a large mouth and a smallie this morning.1.5 inch tubes dont know, they are for pan fish. Rules are rules here.. Dang me.  "
857092,dhickey,2014-06-07 20:19:00,1038,In a tube shallow water? 
857093,Steve,2014-06-07 20:20:00,2075,"i reguarily fish for species that would tow bass all around the lake....but for me, bass fishing isn't the ""fight"", but the ""hunt"".  With that said, successfully landing a 5lbs plus largie out of the slop or wood is not an easy task....."
857095,bushart,2014-06-07 20:43:00,2628,Its a shame but I guess people will do what they do. I bet there will be even more Idiots that will be voting lieberal next week though.   How many degrees of separation does it take to get from OOS bass to voting Liberal----only a true campaigner will know for sure

856806,cityfisher,2014-06-05 18:17:00,959,"Hey all,  My family cottage is on a small lake in the Haliburton area.  Last couple years Ive seen a alarming amount of morons targeting bass this time of year. I have confrontted a couple of them and that didnt go over well. EIther i get the ""take a hike"" or MYOB or im targeting walleye ( yeah sure)  The lake im on also has walleye but a very small population compared to the bass & mostly only bites on a long line troll.  What are your thoughts on getting the word accross? The ministry is no help due to the minimal access and size of the lake.  "
856811,jimmer,2014-06-05 18:42:00,2730,The same old story. All you can do is call the MNR and report. It gets frustrating and is a growing concern.
856816,e-z-out,2014-06-05 19:25:00,1052,Take pictures of boats guys and if your lucky trucks or cars they are driving. Send them in see if anything happens
856817,grimsbylander,2014-06-05 19:44:00,3016,Unless they have them on a stringer I'm afraid you're probably not going to get much attention. It seems the MNR doesn't want to chase people in hopes that they can lay a charge with no physical evidence.
856818,Gallie,2014-06-05 19:49:00,1215,"I see it from march till june around my place, last guy tried to back talk me while hauling in a bass from under my dock, i made a quick movement towards his boat and he almost fell out lol. I call people out on it constantly so they at the very least know that someones watching. I threaten to call mnr, i call mnr, i pretend im taking pics and sometimes do. My new favourite is having my gopro on my head and pushing record as they go by, sure makes them hustle out of my neck of the woods. Why cant people wait??? Is there no other fish you can catch?? No other place to go?? They should all be kicked square in the arse with a steel toed boot"

856826,BucktownAngler,2014-06-05 20:37:00,582,"hopefully you don't get punched in the face, or worse over a bass"
856827,misfish,2014-06-05 21:02:00,29133,"I for one,can understand your frustration. I was like you,in your face  Make the call,let it go after that."
856828,dave524,2014-06-05 21:16:00,4508,"Take pictures of boats guys and if your lucky trucks or cars they are driving. Send them in see if anything happens  Rather than sending them in , make copies and post in conspicuous spots around the lake. Probably stand a better chance shaming them into compliance."
856829,e-z-out,2014-06-05 21:25:00,1052,Yes that would work great
856830,Pigeontroller,2014-06-05 21:31:00,2793,I'd get a good telephoto lens and make it my new hobby to build a case and have 'em busted!
856831,misfish,2014-06-05 21:32:00,29133,And to add  Post pics here.
856832,davey buoy,2014-06-05 21:38:00,5505,That may work??good idea.
856838,dhickey,2014-06-05 22:28:00,1038,I would think that educating these people as to the negative effects of pulling bass off beds might go a long way . I think allot of people miss the point that you must target a particular fish when others are out of season that means not encroaching on fish that are spawning or pre spawn.  What these people don't know or care about is that they have all but ruined that fishes yearly reproduction cycle. Thus giving themselves as well as other responsible anglers less opportunities in the future ..  I have long been an advocator of fishing courses or at the very least a written or on line test in order to get a fishing licence.  Case in point. I work with some one who is educated and has purchased a fishing licence last week and he was raring to go. So I asked him a few basic questions after talking to him and I was wondering (in my head) why this was such a big deal? As it turns out he had absolutely NO idea of the regulations  and I sent his head spinning to the point that he either gets his hands on the regs or he is afraid to go out in fear that he is doing something wrong.  Education is the only way ...  As for the wall of shame cool idea. This could probably work if we all talk to our local bait & tackle stores and who knows OFC might jump on in?   Don.
856840,sneak_e_pete,2014-06-05 22:35:00,540,These guys know what they are doing...and know it is wrong.  Confrontation is always risky...but letting someone know they are being watched is likely a good deterant
856852,Gallie,2014-06-05 23:24:00,1215,"I have gotten in ""confrontations"" before over far less(not in a long time) if im going to go to bat over something im fine with it being against these idiots."
856855,chris.brock,2014-06-05 23:41:00,4053,"it's a little tricky on the multi species lakes, on May 24 weekend, we were catching lakers in shallow bays in 4 fow,  with the pike and walleye expanding their range in Haliburton, the pre-season bass fishing is going to get worse  good for you for doing something and giving the offenders something to think about"
856860,Acountdeleted,2014-06-06 00:13:00,2562,"We're getting guys at my parents cottage flipping all sorts of stuff in 6 inches to 2 feet of water. I give them a fair warning. If they don't move, I go to the dock and start tossing muskie lures towards their boat."
856861,grimsbylander,2014-06-06 00:15:00,3016,Trading one crime for another is senseless. I know with my luck which one of us we end up behind bars. They'd be fishing and I'd be bartering cigarettes.
856866,dhickey,2014-06-06 00:35:00,1038,OK lets try this . You cant fish any lake until the fish have finished bedding/spawning?  Ice out to bass opener?????  What do you think about that????
856871,porkpie,2014-06-06 01:33:00,2521,"I think that people are getting bent over a fish that is just about as prolific as can be.  For gods sake they are big sunfish.  I fish crappie and pike in shallow bays, fish pickerel and pike in waters that smallmouth frequent and catch a fair share of all species including some bass that don't happen to be in season.  I don't flip docks, I don't throw tubes or senkos, but I still catch the damn things every trip out.  To me bass are a species of last resort that I will only fish for if nothing else is doing.  I just can't get stressed if some dude wants to target a fish that would bite a beer can with hooks.  Particularly given all the northern states that have early or year round seasons and still have excellent bass fisherys.  Weird!"
856873,chris.brock,2014-06-06 01:49:00,4053,"it's also about playing by the rules Porkpie, whether we agree with them or not  I know a few bass guys who would be gritting their teeth when hearing you refer to them as those ""damn things"", just sayin'"
856874,Whitespinnerbait,2014-06-06 01:53:00,2038,MYOB.......Would you also stand at a stop sign and start casting Musky lures at those who do an American stop ??
856875,Acountdeleted,2014-06-06 01:53:00,2562,"Our lake has Bass, Walleye and Muskie. After Ice out I won't fish it until bass opener. Lots of other lakes without spawning fish in it. Call me old fashioned I guess.  Spinner, oh if only I could.  Porkie, I've gotten more people interested in fishing and the environment with 'those damn things' then anything else. Kids and people with a short attention span love catching fish. Get them hooked bringing in countless bass then teach them patience with other species."
