858552,grizzlybri,2014-06-15 17:42:00,565,very nice Brian
857524,misfish,2014-06-10 19:53:00,29133,"It amazing what you can find on the net. When I was looking for the replacement support bar, I came across a float tube site that had some nice additions for the tube.  https://www.google.ca/search?q=cumberland+float+tube&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=FV-XU8HoLYSayAT6h4CoBg&sqi=2&ved=0CCsQsAQ&biw=1024&bih=710   I can understand why these inventions work. Strapping the rod beside you is very tight. Well for this guy any ways.  So going through the pics on this site,I took a bit from one,then another, then added my own kickers.  I was planning on hitting the water after work,but parking was crazy.  Anyways,heres my pimp,n.           The front rod holder swivels and so does the finder, so I can get away from  sun glare. The grey clips are for attaching a stringer or some coil retaining clips. The unattended pipe will be for a net.  Total package set me back 26 bux. Also made a new support bar.  "

857529,Terry,2014-06-10 20:01:00,14456,nicely done
857533,kickingfrog,2014-06-10 20:15:00,8333,Misfish is handy with the pvc pipe.
857534,NAW,2014-06-10 20:16:00,4022,Looks awesome!  I have some time off (from June 13 till june 30. We need to get out for a float..  I've you don't mind a 16' blue kayak following you around!

857540,jedimaster,2014-06-10 20:28:00,3472,Imagine sturgeon fishing from a float tube?
857541,misfish,2014-06-10 20:30:00,29133,Looks awesome!  I have some time off (from June 13 till june 30. We need to get out for a float..  I've you don't mind a 16' blue kayak following you around!  Sure thing Nick.
857542,misfish,2014-06-10 20:45:00,29133,"Imagine sturgeon fishing from a float tube?  I dont think I could flip those flippers fast enough to hold my spot.LOL  I,ll stick with perch,bass and pike ,Thank you.  Still waiting for my first laker fight. That will be interesting."
857544,Terry,2014-06-10 20:50:00,14456,"if you get a sturgeon, I want to video it  youtube.... man watersking on a float tube behind a sturgeon last seen near the Pacific rim"
857545,Christopheraaron,2014-06-10 20:51:00,3525,"Nice work! It'll be interesting to see what happens with a 13'6"" float rod sticking out going down the notty LOL."
857625,Twocoda,2014-06-11 05:45:00,4130,Brian did you drill holes in the PVC to keep it in the water or is it going to float up on its side...i suppose you could fill it up if you needed....innovative fishermen are the best fishermen
857632,spincast,2014-06-11 09:21:00,3279,very slick.  I had the same thought as Dave about the holes ? So which one is the drink holder?   Or is that on the other side?
857633,misfish,2014-06-11 09:38:00,29133,I didn't seal off the back part. This is where the water will enter. Just tip and drain.
857663,hoops12,2014-06-11 15:25:00,127,lol....that looks awsome!  Very creative!
857671,lew,2014-06-11 16:11:00,12766,"That's great Brian, really nice job"
857690,Joey,2014-06-11 17:56:00,9122,That's pretty cool B!
857692,Ralph Field,2014-06-11 18:06:00,1018,Looks great !
857696,Headhunter,2014-06-11 18:16:00,5703,"Looks good Brian! Using my little brain here, would it be a good idea to fill the tubes with expandable foam, so should the worse happen and the frame lets go while your fishing, the tube would float you gear? HH"
857707,misfish,2014-06-11 19:02:00,29133,"Thanks guys  Joe,there is a bungie cord that gets attached as well. If I used  floatation,then I would get what Dave (twocoda mentioned)    The coffee cup holder is built in the tube Rick.   Cant wait to give it a go."
857845,Moosebunk,2014-06-12 12:15:00,3970,I soooooooo want the same now Brian.  What an awesome idea and build.  Seriously great.  Right side mount here please.
857873,JoshS,2014-06-12 15:19:00,729,Cool!! Looks cozy
858535,misfish,2014-06-15 16:18:00,29133,"Well it,s back to the drawing board. But I think a simple fix will make it work. It sat above the water which made it flop towards me. So now I have to put in new longer eye bolts so it will get below the water line.  Other then that, it worked well Even had the rod in the front holder trolling with flipper power and caught a fish.LOL  The new little anchor works well too. The claws dig right in and hold.  Folds up in the shape of a hand grenade.  "
858545,Fisherman,2014-06-15 17:28:00,7201,Was that you out there early gently bobbing away by the dive site out front from the beach?  I tried to shout but the fountain makes too much noise.  I'll bring my slingshot next time...
858549,misfish,2014-06-15 17:36:00,29133,"Yes Erich that was I. That water is still dang foot numbing.  The perch were very active at first light,but died down once the  east breeze started.  You should of swam out to say howdy."
