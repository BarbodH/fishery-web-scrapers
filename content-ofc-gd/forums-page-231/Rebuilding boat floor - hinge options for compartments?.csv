858953,Fish4Eyes,2014-06-17 13:10:00,1022,I am currently redoing my boat floor. The carpet and plywood being used is thicker than before and I'm noticing my compartment doors are recessed below the floor line a litte too much for my liking using the existing offset piano hinges.  I seem to be having a hard time finding a offset piano hinge with a bigger offset. What are my options in terms of hinges so the compartments sit flush with the floor? I would prefer not to have the hinges visible on the top of the floor.  Where can you buy this stuff in the Hamilton or surrounding area? It would need to be stainless steel.
