858589,misfish,2014-06-15 20:12:00,29133,Now I see this. But I know I cant have one. No truck and no space to keep it.  Cool invention though.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUNKWDrIqRk
858598,leaf4,2014-06-15 21:41:00,2466,nice one of those would be real fun
858981,hoops12,2014-06-17 15:16:00,127,Interesting!
858987,crappieperchhunter,2014-06-17 16:07:00,2582,Would be perfect for my perch spot in the fall on Lake X. A big improvement over a yak or a tube for solo fishermen IMHO. Any idea how much$$$$?
858988,leaf4,2014-06-17 16:09:00,2466,"I looked around on the site, buying direct it's $1200 USD"
858999,Shloim,2014-06-17 17:16:00,515,"Not such a bad price, I wonder how much it weighs and what transporting and launching it would be like?"
859002,misfish,2014-06-17 17:42:00,29133,"If you watch the full video ,it shows you Shloim"
859004,BillM,2014-06-17 17:47:00,17367,I'd like to see one of those out on Simcoe when it gets bumpy
859008,Shloim,2014-06-17 18:21:00,515,Yes didnt watch the whole thing...
859010,Terry,2014-06-17 19:00:00,14456,"in the video there was 4"" waves and they said see how it handles rough water...don't think it would handle water I fish and storing it transporting it would suck...tube, yak or folding boat would be a better choice for me"
859011,misfish,2014-06-17 19:01:00,29133,"I'd like to see one of those out on Simcoe when it gets bumpy  Bill I have rode 2-2.5 ft wakes from boats in the tube. Not an issue. It,s better then wonderland rides. LOL"
859021,DRIFTER_016,2014-06-17 20:27:00,10439,It's hard with all the different boats out there. What do you think of this for me to chase lakers in? Have to get a custom iPilot Terrova built for it though.

I pucker up,if you know what I mean  ,when I see nice rides,then the gas that it takes to get from A to B."
859037,davey buoy,2014-06-17 21:02:00,5505,"4 7's motors putting out close to 6oohp each,and on a 47' boat if memory serves me right ,getting around 87mph.Sweeeet!!!"
859044,Roy,2014-06-17 21:19:00,13728,My son's boat is powered by a 40HP YANMAR.  Dry weight is 9 tons. Impressive craft but it's something that I can no longer handle by myself. Not my kind of boat...it's just too much work.
859057,aplumma,2014-06-17 21:37:00,6896,     Meet the twins on my boat. They are Chrysler 318's.   Art
