859114,glen,2014-06-17 23:19:00,2641,"""It should be noted that at no point did the bear attack the joggers. This suggests the possibility that it was merely a curious juvenile, looking to make friends. However, we don't blame the frightened fitness-enthusiasts for not sticking around to find out.""  Ya it just wanted someone to tickle its belly. From the inside."
859124,spincast,2014-06-17 23:52:00,3279,"Yeah, he was just circling them and feinting and climbing trees so he could get better look at the camera.  I gotta charge out of the ""pause work out"" line too.  Beat his heart beat meter was off the scale."
859152,Terry,2014-06-18 01:36:00,14456,my underwear would smell so bad that bear wouldn't come near me
859174,limeyangler,2014-06-18 03:26:00,5204,WOW...bet he pooped his lululemons

859176,DRIFTER_016,2014-06-18 03:30:00,10439,"OH, and by the time I got back to the car that bear would be in the next province!!!!"
859202,BillM,2014-06-18 11:27:00,17367,That bear did look like it just wanted to have some fun at the expense of a few terrified joggers
859203,lew,2014-06-18 11:32:00,12766,Maybe the bear just wanted the guys to lead him to a place where he could spend the night LOL  
859213,Dara,2014-06-18 12:26:00,3052,And thats why you don't carry peanut butter and jelly samiches in your pocket while jogging
859216,Rod Caster,2014-06-18 12:45:00,5784,Does he ever seem playful. Can I keep him?
