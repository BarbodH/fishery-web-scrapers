Is the fishing worth it?   I'm mostly into bass/pike/pickeral fishing, but if the trout fishing is any good, I thought about grabbing some spinners, my ultalite and floro-carbin and seeing if I can get lucky.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?"

I'm going to Galeairy in late July with the family for a week of camping.  Did you have a chance to go fishing?  Was it any good?  Online, I've seen quite a few pictures of bass caught there but no pickerel."
