858363,Hooked,2014-06-14 18:14:00,891,"Decided to try a home made weed killer, since the ones in the stores weren't doing ANYTHING!  And the stuff actually works.  Figured I'd pass it along to fine folks on here.  Keep in mind that it will kill grass too though.  And best to do after the dew is off the weeds in morning and no rain in forecast.  Works fairly fast too.  Quite amazed.  4 Litres of vinegar 2 cups of epson salt 1/4 cup of Dawn dish soap (the blue original, mind you not sure if brand really makes a difference)  Give it a try. "

858369,ketchenany,2014-06-14 18:39:00,3229,I do what Lew does! It will also kill grass! The stuff that they sell is the same thing with fancy names and a picture on the sprayer of a dead weed.
858371,ketchenany,2014-06-14 18:41:00,3229,"Forgot to add, I have converted a fabric softener spray bottle and when I spraying my neighbour thinks I'm nuts and asks if it works lol"
858372,manitoubass2,2014-06-14 18:41:00,11391,Just thought id throw this here. Pure vinegar will also kill ants
858377,ketchenany,2014-06-14 18:59:00,3229,"My mom, bless her. When we lived at home she used vinegar for cleaning and desenfecting, The worst was when she would wash ciramic floors! We could never talk her out of it!"
858378,Big Cliff,2014-06-14 19:01:00,6899,So does WD 40. works for wasps too and it is biodegradable. haven't tried it on weeds yet but I might do that this weekend.

I am not convinced that WD 40 is very biodegradable.  I heard people claim that it is made from fish oil; but I pretty sure that is just a myth.  Someone did post a list of ingredients in WD 40; fish oil was not on the list.
858409,Big Cliff,2014-06-14 21:11:00,6899,"Persuant to your post I did some reading  up on WD-40. Turns out you are correct and I was wrong, I was always under the impression that it was fish oil based which it seems is a myth. I always appreciate learning about things and I do appreciate your comment! I have learned something new again. (but it does kill wasps LOL)."
858426,Hoppy,2014-06-14 23:03:00,95,I thought this thread was about homemade killa weed.  Legalize.
858436,dave524,2014-06-15 00:58:00,4508,"Lots of stuff will kill weeds , the trick is to kill them and have the soil suitable for planting something else in a few weeks, not a barren sterile spot for a few years."
858444,wildeye rainbow,2014-06-15 01:26:00,123,"I use the vinegar, table salt and dish soap combination in my sprayer - works great.  It kills anything green.  The only thing about using it, you get a hankering to go and get some fries."

858648,big guy,2014-06-16 02:14:00,414,"Just plain salt will do the trick. Used it on weeds growing up thru the gravel on the driveway last year worked like a charm, still haven't grown back. Plain old table salt, easy as that."
