859350,captpierre,2014-06-19 02:03:00,2521,Gonna get a new aluminum prop this weekend from Kawartha Prop in Buckhorn.  Been looking on line.  Can get several brands for about $150  (13 in x 19p)  Would rather buy local.  perhaps they would exchange in case got the wrong one.  Not sure what brands they carry.  Likely don't carry junk.  Any brands to be avoided?
