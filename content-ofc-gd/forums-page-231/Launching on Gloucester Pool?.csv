859197,kenzy31,2014-06-18 11:01:00,261,Exit 400 at Port Severn Rd. North and follow it straight until you pass the LCBO. At that intersection it turns to Kelly Rd and there's a public launch on a big rock. Parking is across the road. This launch brings you into Little Lake and it's a short 2-3 min boat ride to the narrows into the Pool. Good luck!
