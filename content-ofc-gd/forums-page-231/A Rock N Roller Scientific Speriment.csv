I spared no expense to conduct this experiment to finally find The Truth  So out side I goes to the Barbee (not Barbie) pork chops in  one hand--pop in another  Now The audience is all laying down and I assure them I'm cookin Pork  Said Audience....  Now what's a cook-off without tunage--4 doors open---cd installed....this is what the Nature of the Beast has shown  1st observation...The tune is by The Cowsills (flower Girl)---they all stand up and come to the gate lookin....Cowsills....Duh  2nd Observation...Tune is James Taylor---""I've seen Fire and I've seen rain""---They turn their tails towards me---think they like Carly Simon??  Last Observation...Tune is The Monkees---""Sometime in the mornin""---they all turn towards me and start to Moo (or sing I'm thinkin)  So in Conclusion I can only summarize that if you were a hippy in the 60's and have left us---you may have come back as a cow  Now I could be wrong  So also ---if your down to the A & P lookin for Condensed milk and see Reincarnation--it could be milk from dead cows (Mad magazine)  More experiments to come..."
