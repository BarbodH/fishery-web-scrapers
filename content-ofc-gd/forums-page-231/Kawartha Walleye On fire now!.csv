858863,Slayingm,2014-06-16 22:40:00,204,With the warming lake temperatures and increased weed growth the Walleye have been on the feeding mode lately for sure! The past 3 weeks customers have all caught some nice Walleye's and the action remains steady and should only get better the next few weeks. Various plastic grubs and minnow shaped baits have all worked well.  Depths in the 9 to 12ft range along weedlines with hard bottom areas have produced the best action so far. Light braid line with fluorocarbon leaders tied directly to the jigs have been the key to success.Get out and enjoy the action while its hot!Good luck and be safe out there.... Greg.

858927,Hooked,2014-06-17 05:31:00,891,I hope it stays on fire until the end of July and first week of August!  As I will be up there then.

858967,BillM,2014-06-17 14:12:00,17367,That fish actually appears to be on fire.
858993,Slayingm,2014-06-17 16:47:00,204,I hope it stays on fire until the end of July and first week of August!  As I will be up there then. The deepest weedlines and rock humps produce well that time of year so you should do well.  Good luck!
