Anyone have any ideas where I could get access to the Saugeen River or a pier or whatever. Could someone give me a hint on where I might try my luck. Thanks in advance."
5567,Cookslav,2006-11-27 16:43:00,1457,Well....your first post shouldn't be a request for spots. Just have a quick read over the rules sticky and post a quick little intro first. No harm done...just a freidly gesture we like to see  What kind of equipment you bringing? Do you have wadders?
5574,jsalz,2006-11-27 17:03:00,8,"Yep I have waders and a 10.5 foot rod. Sorry about the introduction, I did say hi on the old board. Didn't think of doing it on the new one. My bad. Btw the new board looks great. A little graphic intensive for my crackberry though. Lol"
5674,Cookslav,2006-11-27 20:47:00,1457,"Ah I see, your were on the old board...my bad then didn't recognize the handle  I'd go in at Dennys Dam in Southampton then and walk down drifting the runs. I've found the chute(first big bend) good this time of year but you will probobly have to find room to squeeze in...lotta guys go after work to wind down.  If the water is to muddy(which it often can be) Make the treck to The Sauble river...tends to be 90% more clear but can be hit and miss.  Good luck,"
5697,jsalz,2006-11-27 22:09:00,8,Thanks for the tips!
5716,FISHEYEZ,2006-11-27 22:55:00,49,"yup...dennys dam is a great place to start,    try some of the pools around the abutments too,     and then make your way around the big bend at the parkin lot.......   thats enough for one day,  a lot of marching  good luck,   post a report when your back"
6302,jsalz,2006-11-29 03:34:00,8,"Just as an FYI, got skunked two days in a row. Keep in mind, I was only out for about 2 hours yesterday and 2 and a half today. Also keep in mind, that I'm a complete rookie when it comes to bow fishing. I'm not really sure how much leader to leave. Should I use floater spawn bags or regular, how much weight should I use and how many, what spots to target?. This is starting to be alot like golf! Oh well, trial and error I suppose. Damn Rainbow"
6480,Cookslav,2006-11-29 17:51:00,1457,"Float fer sure in that area.... just enough lead to be off bottom, and bounce.  Don't be afraid to switch up to a Pinky, Fly's, cleo's, spinners, and rapala's if the roe isn't working.  When its on..its on But when its off....it can be slow"
6519,just2manylures,2006-11-29 19:26:00,144,"I don't get much of a chance to go nail some 'bows myself, But I have found that Cookslav mentioned.  When they shut down.....THEY SHUT DOWN  my 2 cents  2many"
