Two"" Oakville is quiet a hike for me not sure i fancy driving back too late. But then do not want to drive all that way just for a sake of a few hrs.  Is anyone going to be staying over night in oakville? As in hotel acomodations?  Are their any close to where the swill is?  I do not know oakville at all......  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanx"

Ask for some info. It could be the same hotel Gerrit is talking about.  That's the reason Friday is better for the big show. Most people aren't working the next day and long distance travellers can relax and enjoy the evening, rather than leave early to get home or not come at all.  Hope to see you there."
