6674,fishindevil,2006-11-30 01:29:00,6254,"its a medium line unit with fairly decent power for most inland medium depth lakes ,it also has a user friendly menu and is quite easy to operate,one hint you may like to use is put it in the manual mode and adjust the sensitivity and grayline and depth cursure your self,you can also zoom in on your own numbers on the side bar,what i mean is you can use the depth cart in manual and it will get the most of your graph instead of using it in the auto mode i never use auto mode in my lowrance i always use manual and it works harder and better to see what you need to,all in all its a good unit for the price and pretty reliable...hope this helps...ps..read the manual about manual mode ....operation"
