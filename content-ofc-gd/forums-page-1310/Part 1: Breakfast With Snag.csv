6751,snag,2006-11-30 04:41:00,1932,"Had to head out on biz early in the morning Yesterday.  Thought I would experiment with new lures and location.  Minor success.  Feisty, not too big, not too small but really scrappy.  Probably Irish.     Then this dude hit. aaaand I lost it! Lampreys left a few hickies on him/her (Now look closely, I know the picture is poor but, I hadn't hooked him/her. He/she just wouldn't let go until I attempted aquatic expulsion therapy)   Thank you.  The End     NOW GET BACK TO WORK  YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.  BAD PEOPLE. BAD."
