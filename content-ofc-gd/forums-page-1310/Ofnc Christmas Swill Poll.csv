2779,robin,2006-11-20 18:19:00,46,Friday 29th Robin
2805,bpsbassman,2006-11-20 19:12:00,941,"Friday the 29th, although Wednesday or Thursday would probably work as well."
2808,fishdawg,2006-11-20 19:16:00,912,Tuesday tradition!
2818,setomonkey,2006-11-20 19:24:00,872,I voted Thursday but I could probably make Wed or Fri. Tues is tough b/c I'll probably have Christmas-related plans that night.  Mike
2835,TJQ,2006-11-20 19:47:00,7806,tuesday seems a bit too close to my xmas hangover...

2873,Handlebarz,2006-11-20 20:46:00,3790,Firday for me also tuesday is out but any other day could work I am off for the week
2875,Guest mistyriver1,2006-11-20 20:48:00,0,"I voted Friday, but could make probably any night."
2891,wuchikubo,2006-11-20 21:13:00,1114,"What time does this normally start?  I voted tues, but any friday is okay as well."
2906,tonyb,2006-11-20 21:46:00,1637, Usually about 7:00 PM-ish until we run out of one of the following: a) Beer Stomach room for wings c) Fishing lies
2924,Ron,2006-11-20 22:21:00,1683,Friday would be the best day for me. I will be working all the other days except Boxing Day.
2928,Carp,2006-11-20 22:25:00,1488,"I like Friday because most people aren't working the next day and it would be easier for people coming from farther away. People are more likely to stick around and chat since there's no hurry to get to bed.  Having said that, I should be able to make any night."
2938,Greencoachdog,2006-11-20 22:41:00,8163,"Right now I'm plannin' on bein' up there that week, so any night would prolly be ok for right now... will have to evaluate as the time draws nearer."
2973,Carp,2006-11-20 23:45:00,1488,"Try taking off your shirt up here at that time of year tough guy. That's how we can tell who the tourists are. As soon as the temp gets below freezing, they have to put shirts on.  Will be nice to meet you in person GDC."
2977,PatB,2006-11-20 23:50:00,104,"I'll be Friday, unless the majority picks Tuesday, I'll there too."
2983,Gerritt,2006-11-20 23:56:00,6129,With the amount of biz we bring them.... ask if they will offer us 2-4-1 regardless of what day we decide to make it... I am sure they will be more then willing as this is hardly our first time there...  myself personally Thursday would be best Boxing day is gonna be difficult for most.. see as how there are two sides to most families and alot like myself split it up one day one side the next day the other side...  Just my 0.02  Gerritt.
3026,motv8tr,2006-11-21 01:14:00,2587,"Well dang, looks like I'm not going again this year, and here I thought I booked my days off well   Wed. is the only night I can go  .  Tues is a big family thing, and I'm back to work early Fri. morning...  We need to plan this much earlier so I can pick my days off to go....so next year, set the date by early November would ya  Maureen"
3031,Rattletrap2,2006-11-21 01:17:00,1652,"Wed., Thurs., or Friday would work for me. The 26th would be tough if not impossible. I voted Thursday!"
