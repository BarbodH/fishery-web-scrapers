3738,kennyman,2006-11-22 05:31:00,737,"I'm addicted to my WFN. I like alot of fishing shows. Keep in mind I'm a newbie so my opinions may vary greatly from some of the seasoned veterans on this board. Classic Patterns may be the most informative for me. It's really good at teaching you how to fish. What to look for as far as structure,weather,reading the water etc. Charlie Ingrams on Fishing university is pretty good at teaching too and he's funny with lines like ""it excites me down to my googles"" LOL. Fishin Canada is a very good show IMO and one of the few that will give you the locations they fish (right down to coordinates sometimes). If I had to pick one TV fishing celeb to go fishing with it'd probably be Pete Bowman from this show. Actually Ron James from Fish TV seems like he'd be fun too.If you're looking for something intense Extreme Angler definetely fits the bill. Man can that guy catch some Kawartha bass..... awesome! Definetely ""power fishing"". On a completely different wavelength, the scenery and production of Mark Krupa's Hooked on Fishing is great. He's also really excited about fishing (almost in awe) and that comes through in every show. To use a musical analogy,Mark Krupa is jazz, K-Dawg is thrash metal. It depends what you're in the mood for. Darryl Choronzey and Bob Izumi are great to watch but sometimes they pump the products (older shows especially) so hard it drives me nuts. I guess that's what pays the bills sometimes it just get a little excessive. I'd still love to go fishing with either one and that shore lunch would be great.. yum. Now The Next Bite I've only seen once so far. Either I have a conflicting schedule or it's not on that much. Seems like it's only on at 1:30 in the morning darn it. I'd love to watch more about those ""toothy critters"". Man I could go on all night.  Go to WFN and check it out. They have some shows on demand right now so if you have high speed you can watch some shows. Seriously ....... check out the Lumberjack Larrgemouth Extreme Angler (go to the top 15 tab on the top of the page). Happy couch warming."
3747,Marc Thorpe,2006-11-22 10:34:00,621,"  Thats why you surround yourself with RottWellers  Actually the nice thing and beauty of OFC is its always been a safe board and place to contribute  Congrats on the beauty board guys Been awhile ,needed a break  I like em all,I guess cause I work with em all  I do know,you wanna watch The Next Bite,Getting Hooked with Aaron and Barry and Urban Outdoors this coming winter,We got some great footage and I think some great singning also  Do you have the time to listen to whine About nothing and everting all at once I am one of those melodramatic fools ,Neurotic to the bone no doubt about it"
3754,rwheeler,2006-11-22 11:16:00,2,"Similar to T.J. I'm a little biased on this one because I know Shaun, but met him as a fan after I started watching (so I guess it's not that bad.)  My favorite would have to be Urban Outdoor Adventures. I regulary watch quite a few others, but this show seems to be a little more cutting edge and faster paced for my taste. I grew up watching shows of the south with hosts yelling ""look-a-that-bayass"" and have grown very tired of it. I seem to gravitate towards shows that are more informative and aren't just a couple of talking heads telling bad jokes.  Ryan"
3860,ccmtcanada,2006-11-22 15:54:00,7971,"Thanks everyone!  Rogers Digital is offering WFN free of charge for now, so I'll sit back and start watching! Thanks to all who posted their fav shows, and to those who are either host the shows or work on them, thanks for adding your posts as well.  Looking foward to watching, and learning....and hopefully catching more fish next spring."
3876,ricoboxing,2006-11-22 16:24:00,398,my fav is Shelley and Courtney. Whenever I can't fall asleep I just watch one of their episodes!!
3888,setomonkey,2006-11-22 16:38:00,872," LOL!  I don't mind not having cable anymore except in the winter, when I could at least watch fishing shows while waiting for the next season to start...  Mike"
3892,ricoboxing,2006-11-22 16:46:00,398, thats why Jesus made ice augers!!
3893,setomonkey,2006-11-22 16:49:00,872,"I tried ice fishing once last year and didn't think much of it. Rented a hut on Simcoe, had one bite and lost it on the retrieve b/c I didn't get a good hookset.  But I'm thinking of trying it again this year.  Mike"
3930,Ben_Daniels,2006-11-22 18:19:00,435,"Being new to Canada I find Extreme Angler TV to be my favorite by far, its new to me and extremly well put together. For entertainment FNC uncut is great. Anyone seen FishOMania?.............boring."
3938,Kirk,2006-11-22 18:45:00,347,"Since getting WFN, although never been tarpon fishing personally, the tarpon shows have caught my eye as a new favorite."

5080,kemper,2006-11-25 21:14:00,2232,Just about anything...except the dimebag fishermen
5100,irishfield,2006-11-25 22:10:00,26272,Really enjoying Pete Maina fishing with Thorpe right now. Pete looks great with his matching blue umbrelly ! LOL
5105,BLACKFISH88,2006-11-25 22:18:00,191,ACTION ANGLING!! hands down.....LOL!
5329,spoonman,2006-11-26 19:53:00,103,"I think Urban Outdoor Adventures is by far the best fishing show on tv here in Canada. I am getting so sick of Italo fishing with his wife, Barb. Cronzeys days are done, just do an eating show he would like it better. Food network for him.LOL Izumi still has a decent show but hats off to Urban Outdoor Adventures."
5352,Jacques,2006-11-26 22:27:00,97,"I agree -- Mark Krupa has a great show -- even though I'm not a fly fisherman.  I *hate* the driving rock music on the 'extreme' fishing shows.  They turn me off wanting to watch WFN.  The whole point of fishing, for me, is to escape the noise and respect the environment.  I don't get a sense of a whole lotta respect for the fish on those shows..."
5654,Muskyfanatic,2006-11-27 19:50:00,3,"Thanks to TJ for e-mailing me a link to this thread. I haven't posted in a while as I've been pretty busy, I have to say that the new board looks great, good job guys!  Thanks for the kind words about the show, it's great to hear that people are enjoying what we put together each year. It's a lot of work but what a way to make a living, I'm truly blessed. I'm also fortunate to have a very talented and committed crew behind me.  For those of you that may be interested, or perhaps missed us over the past 2 years on OLN, CTV and CH, we just signed a deal with WFN. They will be rerunning seasons 1 & 2 of Urban Outdoor Adventures over the next 52 weeks. We should start airing around December 1st, but you may want to check the WFN site for our official air dates and times: http://www.wfn.tv  Thanks again everyone, and from all of us at Hook More Fish Television Inc we hope you continue to enjoy the show. We have some pretty exciting new stuff that we're incorporating into the show next year  Cheers and all the best,  Shaun"
6043,Aaron Shirley,2006-11-28 19:16:00,655,"I would also like to say thanks for the great feedback for Getting Hooked with Aaron and Barry.  I know many of you don't get the channel Wild TV that we air on currently, however most of you should be able to watch our show starting January 7th Sunday mornings on the Outdoor Life Network.  Make sure to tune into our show Sunday mornings on OLN this January, as we have filmed with two members of OFC this year, Marc Thorpe and Tony Bolger!  When I'm not busy working on the show, this message forum is my favourite place to visit on the web.  TJ and the crew here are great, and the members that make this forum are top notch people.  This is a great internet community and a great place to meet other anglers that share our passion.  Good fishing!  Aaron Shirley"
6057,bpsbassman,2006-11-28 19:40:00,941,Hope to see you at the next swill again Aaron.
6098,Aaron Shirley,2006-11-28 20:39:00,655,"I would like to get out to another swill.  I don't always have the time to get on here and see the swill dates working two full-time jobs.  If you could send me a pm or e-mail with the next swill date, I'll do my best to be there... unless I'm working of course.  I had a lot of fun at the last swill I was at.  Good fishing!  Aaron Shirley"

3435,K-K-DAWG,2006-11-21 19:54:00,31,"Hey T.J,  Thanks for the invite, your site looks like a great place for anglers to share the ""addiction or passion""as some like to call it; Our show, EXTREME ANGLER TV has grown in popularity very quickly with viewers and supporters alike ... season five starts in January on WFN, and we have introduced an even WIDER variety of species to our 100% ALL-CANADIAN CONTENT menu for a greater appeal to more multi-specie-angler tastes;  Mixed in with the monster bass, we we`re fortunate (lucky...lol) enough to capture some incredible footage at locations most canadian anglers can drive to; here`s a sample of what viewers can expect in `07:  Spring Lake Trout Jigging spoons Detroit River walleyes on the curly tail grub Tube drag bronzebacks Lake Erie summer steelhead on the troll Oversized largemouths hiding in the wood Slab sized crappies in spring Topwater smallmouth on poppers Big bronzebass in shallow largie water Open water whitefish on the spoon Jumbo yellow perch on plastics Trophy bigmouth bass hiding in deep trees Black crappie in fall on weed clumps Walleyes on the worm harness Lake Erie`s ""super-sized smallmouths"" Frog bass gone wild Stick-worm largemouth November smallies on the kawartha shoals Shallow Docks = Big Bass and so much more!  And, our All-Fishing publication, Canada`s EXTREME ANGLER ANNUAL, looks like it`s going to be our biggest issue ever, released nationally across Canada and the northern USA in January. It`s jammed packed with multi-specie topics, how-tos, when-tos, and with-whats, written by some of the hottest anglers in the bizz....and best of all written for and by Canadian anglers. check us out  http://www.extremeanglertv.com  gotta go...thanks again for the invite till next time, KK"
3439,Rich,2006-11-21 19:58:00,3927, Best show on TV IMO
3451,Smokey,2006-11-21 20:35:00,1278,Hey TJ. The upgrade can be done now and you get a credit back on your bill for the cost along with the free installation. I had it done last week and its a full upgrade to make everything highdef if I ever upgrade the tv in the future. Now along with WFN you can also get Wildtv a Canadian network with all fishing and hunting shows. PM me if you want anymore info on how to go about getting it done with credit.  Mike
3452,xrap,2006-11-21 20:35:00,683,"  AGREED, love that show"
3469,tonyb,2006-11-21 21:00:00,1637,"Getting Hooked with Aaron and Barry is great since they film a lot of locations right here in S. Ontario.  I think they film in popular areas using new/different techniques to catch more fish.  Personally, I think that is the most important aspect of a show, not guys going to fly-in lodges or exotic locations where the fish hit anything you throw at them.  I am keeping my fingers crossed that their show is a big success.  They are the type of guys that deserve the most success, as they are stand up guys that would give the shirt off their back to help someone in need.  I believe they air on WildTV now and will be airing National on OLN come January.  Cheers, Tony"
3470,motv8tr,2006-11-21 21:00:00,2587,"  Hey Mike, I called them about it and wasn't impressed with how they do it.  They told me they would need to take 90.00 off my credit card, then give me 15.00 credit for 6 months.  Why not just put 90.00 on my bill then give me the credit in full on the next bill, or better yet, put it back on my card.  That's why I haven't done it yet.  Maureen"
3475,Smokey,2006-11-21 21:14:00,1278,"Hey Maureen they are supposed to do a full one time credit to mine, I must have hit the right person on the phone. I'm going to phone them to confirm and will let you know.  Mike"
3476,urbanangler1990,2006-11-21 21:14:00,933,"i love urban outdoor adventures. I am an urbanangler and dont travel too far, not that i even can, and this show is great, teaches u urban angling spots and techneques, and that u dont have to travel far to hook into a trophy."
3528,fishindevil,2006-11-21 22:43:00,6254,"THE NEXT BITE ,IS BY FAR THE BEST,        and i have WFN,so ive seen them all,"

We're excited about this upcoming year too, as we just started the editing process on the coming year's shows ... some great stuff on the way. Truly have some very talented young guys putting it together for us.  (Of course the whole thing is a little tough right now, as the deer season is on here ... hard for me to concentrate on stuff like editing. Still waiting for my big buck to stumble by.)  Best,  Pete"
3624,moemoe,2006-11-22 01:47:00,352,"I have a bunch of preferences....I know I know lot of people say it's one big infomartial....but I like Fishful thinking, Charley Wray always explains tackle and presentation well,......Extreme angler and next bite, also pretty  good, but  I am a guy that likes loud music ie Metallica, Audioslave, but I think Extreme Angler would be more enjoyable if the backround audio was turned down a notch... Really I enjoy all shows save Dimestore ""Dail It UP!"" .....They drive me crazy"
3627,dheitzner,2006-11-22 01:48:00,314,"personally, my favorite 3 are: 1 - Classic Patterns 2 - CFT Tour 3 - Extreme Angler TV honorable mentions go to Fishful Thinking(Charley Wray), Bob Izumi & Roland Martin, whos shows I also really enjoy."
