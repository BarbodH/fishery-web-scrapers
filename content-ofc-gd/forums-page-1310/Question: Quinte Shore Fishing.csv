6438,spinnerbait,2006-11-29 16:07:00,1,"Not ready to put away the tackle, and too scared to venture out at this time of year.  Is walleye fishing from shore at Quinte an option this year?  Can someone catch like that?  Anyone have any suggestions for location (not looking for honey holes, just general thoughts)?"
6591,brifishrgy,2006-11-29 23:21:00,559,"can go to Trenton , Bellville, Desoronto or Picton and have a chance at shore fish .. best time seems to be evening but can also get them during the day"

Ended up catching pike and walleye as sun went down using deep diving minnowbaits.  Hope this helps,  ehg"
