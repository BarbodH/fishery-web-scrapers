I've received an offer of employment from the York Regional Police. I'm heading to OPC in January, but my training starts in 2 weeks with York. So I won't be working to hard next week, i have a pulled muscle in my back so I have to relax...  No more worrying about money or how i'm going to feed the family.....it's nice when years of hard work have come together!!!!"
