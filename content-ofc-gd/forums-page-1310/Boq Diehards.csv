6784,Harrison,2006-11-30 11:58:00,2202," Finally, hoping maybe these cooler temps will open up some more water... even mid week now your zig zagging lines and boats.  Busiest Ever.  As for presentation with this incoming system, try higher in the water column and a slower/wide wobble bait...  Good luck.."
