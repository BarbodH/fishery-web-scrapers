5562,glirw,2006-11-27 16:22:00,200,"Oh , how cool it would be go fishing one of these days . It has been too long .  Awesome report ! Nice fishies !"
5682,majorlifts,2006-11-27 21:11:00,171,"WoW!!!! That was a great time. I didnt think it was possible but we got er done. I cant believe the amount of white bass we caught, and I tell ya, because of the climate change we have seen some pretty wild changes in the fishing. For instance, we would go and catch browns from dust till dawn, no eyes and maybe a few white bass. Now, BAMM!!! eyes like crazy, and no browns. Crazy changes. We also have had similar changes on other lakes as well."
5727,The Urban Fisherman,2006-11-27 23:25:00,2050,What a report!!!!! Talk about a beauty line up of fish!  congrats!
5728,Kerry,2006-11-27 23:27:00,383,Nice pics guys. I was going to say the same thing fishdevil.My buddy in Toronto used to get me to come down and go out at the pickering plant with him in FEB/MARCH.That outflow had everything and was a hoot.Don't know if you can even get near there now.The hardest part was getting the truck unstuck at Frenchman's bay pulling the boat out in that sand. Kerry
5742,JEREMY,2006-11-28 00:10:00,300,Good job i have not caught anything in a month except a bit of greif from the old lady lol.
5826,ehg,2006-11-28 03:24:00,2666,"Just a word of caution to anyone thinking of taking a boat out on Lake Ontario at night or mid-winter, it can be very treacherous.Even though there was no wind that night we were still a tad scared out there, even though we have done this well over 50 times. Actually the big lake has quickly blown up in the past and i've never been more scared in my life.  Majorlifts now your 'Dude'?  That walleye was probably 8 lbs as well, very fat.  cheers,  ehg"
6129,Aaron Shirley,2006-11-28 21:09:00,655,"Awesome report, those are great white bass!  I have caught some nice white bass on the lower Niagara River fishing for steelhead in the spring, but those fish you guys got into were true hawgs!  WTG  Aaron Shirley"
6296,007,2006-11-29 03:14:00,537,Thanks for the info Baby Herc - may be I'll see if I catch one of those white bass from shore next spring :-)
6446,Tacklebuster,2006-11-29 16:24:00,303,"I remember one spring seeing a guy on GB catching them by the bucket load.  So my question is, do they fall under the same catagory as SMB and LMB in the regulatations?"
5214,ehg,2006-11-26 05:54:00,2666,"Went out this night with buddy (Majorlifts) to try and find a few walleye like recently reported. He ended up catching a pile of these..  and another one  another  white bass  more  at least he caught something different  an ugly sheepshead. oh well  Finally he caught what we were looking for   Personally, i caught nothing despite using same lures, equipment etc.. Dave had a good night. All the white bass were 17 - 19 inches and fat. He caught all fish on silver rattlin rap.  Don't see the white bass too often.  cheers,  ehg"
5215,BabyHerc,2006-11-26 07:03:00,285,Those are some nice white bass!
5216,Bob,2006-11-26 07:45:00,370,"One of the true basses in Ontario waters.  They're related to the sea basses, unlike the largemouth and smallmouth which are sunfish.  They're tasty too!"
5221,jediangler,2006-11-26 08:46:00,1923,Nice walleye to finish the day off. How do those white bass fight? I've never caught one but they look stocky enough to give you a battle tougher than the walleye probably did.
5249,setomonkey,2006-11-26 14:06:00,872,"Sounds like a fun night, thanks for posting the report...  Mike"
5271,Carp,2006-11-26 15:19:00,1488,Those are some chuncky white bass. Congrats on the walleye too.
5275,woodro,2006-11-26 15:40:00,168,"sweet white bass man, ive never caught one of those before. can you find them in any fresh water lake?"
5288,Spiel,2006-11-26 16:42:00,9065,"....Different, I'll say. I know a bunch of guys myself included that would love to get onto some big silvers like those. Nice catch indeed."
5289,mattyk,2006-11-26 16:46:00,2110,Those white bass are a lot of fun. I catch a ton of them in the Ohio River in Kentucky. Thanks for sharing the pics.
5297,BabyHerc,2006-11-26 17:07:00,285,"Woodro, white bass are found in all Great Lakes, except Superior, and in Lake Nippising."
5299,Bly,2006-11-26 17:11:00,1556,Great looking bass!  Always nice to have success!!  bly
5303,Clampet,2006-11-26 17:26:00,1947,I think they're also called Silver Bass  http://www.ohiodnr.com/wildlife/Fishing/aq...id/whtebass.htm
5346,Mike the Pike,2006-11-26 21:39:00,3421,
5354,PERCHER,2006-11-26 22:42:00,787,Nice eye.Looks like you had a successful night.
5370,007,2006-11-27 00:17:00,537,Great looking fish.  Congrats.    Have never seen a White Bass before - thanks for sharing.  Do they live in deep water in Lake O. or can you catch them from shore?  007
5387,Rattletrap2,2006-11-27 00:59:00,1652,Those fish are fantastic! A rare catch for sure for most of us. A nice mixed bag with the Walleye and Drum added in. I have heard of them (White Bass) being caught in the summer around the moored yachts and stuff along the Lake front. Probably the closest thing to Striped Bass we will get.
5427,ehg,2006-11-27 03:09:00,2666,"The white bass fight much like largemouth except they don't jump. Very scrappy. They don't get much bigger in Canada than these ones. Very rare to run into them anyways. Probably my favourite fish next to musky and steelhead.  Oddly, i fished same lures, same spots, and caught nada. Strange.  ehg"
5438,MuskyBill,2006-11-27 03:40:00,311,"Great mixed bag, Erik.  I was at your spot today (I think) & all I got were Sheepshead. I saw big schools of the Bass, but they were much smaller than the ones majorlifts caught.  Say what you will though, Sheepies put up an awesome fight...."
5445,snag,2006-11-27 04:44:00,1932,Nice report!  I love the night shots. Bet you didn't have too much company.
5480,ccmtcanada,2006-11-27 12:47:00,7971,Wow!  Great job guys!  I've never seen those bass before.  Nice to cap it all off with that walleye too!
5498,b2kptbo,2006-11-27 13:27:00,1505,Good size white bass and the others aren't too shabby either...
5523,fishindevil,2006-11-27 14:40:00,6254,"very nice catch guys ,i havnt seen any white bass since we were allowed to fish the pickering nuke plant ,they used to school around the nuke plant all winter long and were always fun to catch,but nice report & pics guys"
5551,woodro,2006-11-27 15:50:00,168,thanks herc
5560,BabyHerc,2006-11-27 16:18:00,285,"No Problem Woodro.  007, white bass are an open-water schooling fish.  They don't relate to structure too often; they mostly relate to schools of pelagic baitfish (shad, emerald shiners).  They are catchable from shore in May and June, though, during the spawning run.  They run up larger rivers like walleye and steelhead."
5561,Puckhead,2006-11-27 16:18:00,377,Fantastic!  You learn something new everyday... Never knew we had white bass around...
