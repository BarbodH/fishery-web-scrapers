5204,holdfast,2006-11-26 05:07:00,1813,"For some reason, when I hear the Doobie Brothers song ""Black Water"", I think of fishing at a particular time when I was fishing as a kid in Vermont. So I mellow out. <<<<Nothing to do with drugs>>>>.  How about you folks, is there such a song, and why??"
5211,sturgman,2006-11-26 05:46:00,249,"Holy Diver, Ronnie James dio..  Listening to this will give you the creeps on a back bay still fishing at night when there isnt a soul for miles."
5217,Bob,2006-11-26 07:50:00,370,"""I'm Gonna Miss Her"" by Brad Paisley.  Love that song and I sang it tonight."
5218,Moosebunk,2006-11-26 08:03:00,3970,"FISH ON!!! and, The Ol Diamond Back Sturgeon by Primus, just because of the lyrics.  That ""I'm Going Fishing All the of the time and my baby's going fishing too,"" song at the intro of ""Going Fishing,"" but then, at the end of the same show they have that different ""Going Fishing"" song.  On any given day either one will be humming in my head as I'm touring up river in the boat. lol  Travelling Riverside Blues by Zeppelin is likely my longest running and favorite going fishing song.  At the same time, whenever I hear it it reminds me of taking off in a plane on the runway at the airport in Moosonee."

Just teasing  There were three guys about 12 feet away from us out on the water this morning and we got to listen to them singing Kareoke for the best part of an hr......Then i could not take anymore and had to move......The fish had stopped biteing i thought it was there singing...lmao....Turns out it was a nice size pike that had turned off the perch......They pulled it into they're boat and a beauty it was.
