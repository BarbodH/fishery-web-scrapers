Most of the bites we got were right at sunset and we still couldnt get any after dark which is very strange! Brett did manage a new PB with a 12lb even fish caught on a Manns stretch 20 in pearl.    Due to boat traffic and slow fishing we decided to trailer the boats to Big Bay and hit some spots out there. Not alot of fish but a steady pick of large fish. Most caught on regular taildancers and shad raps. Blue and silver seemed to be the colour of choice this weekend.  My best fish this weekend was a 10.7 lb fish picked up on a blue and silver shad rap off of a inline board.    We did manage a double of 7.6 and 8.7 on Saturday.   Saturday evening we blew 3 big fish in a row. All hooks pulling out.  With the weather repoirt for the next 15 days it looks like that may be my last quinte trip, didnt beat my PB of 14lbs and 34 inches but there is always next year."

6484,Terry,2006-11-29 17:58:00,14456,wow the great BOQ reports just keep coming
6501,Headhunter,2006-11-29 18:40:00,5703,"Great pics and report! I can't believe how calm Quinte has been in the last few weeks! It looks like a mill pond in the background of those shots. Wondering  if you happen to recall the water temp when you were there? Thanks, HH"
6506,bucktail,2006-11-29 19:08:00,1857,The water temperatures ranged from 39 in the shallows to 41 out past the ferry. We didnt mark much bait up in big bay but with reports coming from Belleville of fish being caught we knew they must now be spread out throughout the bay. Most fish were running deep down 40-70 in 80+ feet of water east of the ferry. We had our riggers but chose not to try for any eyes below 30ft since its an automatic keeper then. Still amazed at how many 10lb+ are being kept. God get a repro done its all most the same cost. Our crew kept two 6lbers for the table as that was the smallest we caught and I havn't kept an eye in a couple of years.
6507,fishindevil,2006-11-29 19:09:00,6254,"thanks for the report,and very nice pics,you guys are the first that i know of from here to get fish up in big bay,way to go"

6530,b2kptbo,2006-11-29 20:15:00,1505,"Yeah, gotta like the BOQ reports, lots of biggins..."
6577,Ron,2006-11-29 22:50:00,1683,"Nice read Bucktail.  Keep the beard bud, it makes you look younger! LOL  I just get over the weather we're having still. If it stays like this, I will be out on Quinte with the boat til mid Feb."
6584,Clampet,2006-11-29 23:01:00,1947,Jethro says it's a shame the BOQ Walleyes aren't any good eating. 
6640,Carp,2006-11-30 00:43:00,1488,"Excellent outing, even if the fishing was slow. The quality makes up for the lack of quantity."
