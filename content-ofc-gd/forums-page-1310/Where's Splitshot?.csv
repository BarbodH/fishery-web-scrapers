Anyone out there heard from Splitshot?  Old buddy, old pal we need you back on here.  Your the voice of reason.  my 2 cents  2many  PS you can have the board admin add your post count to your new account once you re-register.  I know I was really worried about that."

I just hope you can make a decision that is best for you old pal.  I know you will make the right one, I just hope we can get you back on here.  We miss you  my 2 cents  2many"
