5233,MuskyBill,2006-11-26 12:38:00,311,"If you've decided to start collecting the set, please send me a PM.  It'd be much easier to collect the set with more collecters, & we could even trade through the mail, or in person if you're around the area I'm in....  I just started, on a whim, but have decided to collect the set. Unfortunately, I've already got a small pile of doubles...."
5250,danc,2006-11-26 14:11:00,4677,"I haven't looked Bill, but I think the tv commercial said something about trading cards at the McDonalds web site. Good luck.."
5282,steve_paul,2006-11-26 15:55:00,658,"Bill, Ryan is after me to get some.  I will let you know what he gets, see if you need em.  Here is the link for the Rotten Ronnies trading site too.  http://www.mcdonalds.ca/McDonaldsHockeyCar...en/default.aspx"
5285,walleyejigger,2006-11-26 16:18:00,876,"not a collector but, i was talking to a guy who is a time keeper at work who gets a collection every year, says he expects to spend almost $200 to get the set, some of the special cards have odds of 1 in 100 packs or something like that, the first day they were on sale he purchased $60 worth,  good luck on your quest, hopefully trading with others will bring your cost down"
5374,Fang,2006-11-27 00:30:00,1330,"keep me in mind as well Bill. Although I tend to keep all cards even if I get doubles, triples.  I do the sets each year but take note No Crosby card. Guess he didn't get enough money  I got a poster the other day that showed all cards. Sub sets are nice especially the goalie cards."
5377,pidge,2006-11-27 00:35:00,438,"Are they still upperdeck? Not that I'm gona start collectin, but I was just curious if anyone knows if those sets are worth much. I'v got old ones I use to collect when I was younger that I still havent opened."
5503,Fang,2006-11-27 13:43:00,1330,Yep still upper deck.  The Becketts guide might still list em but last time i looked you had to get one of the annual guides
5507,Terry,2006-11-27 13:54:00,14456,"well I would trade Mc cards, but everytime I eat their food, I get the McChits ...I think I could find better stuff for my kids to eat...    ...............................super size me................"
5837,MuskyBill,2006-11-28 04:09:00,311,"Thanks for the link, Steve....& everybody else for the advice...."
5846,glirw,2006-11-28 05:07:00,200,"I have a small pile that was passed down to me .  It's all yours , I couldn't care much for hockey PM me if u want to pick it up , or if you wait until winter break I'll put it in the mail for you , it's only 29 cards."
6108,98Fahrenheit,2006-11-28 20:49:00,108,Sell them on eBay.  The next issue of Beckett should list them in the back of the issue.
6123,ccmtcanada,2006-11-28 21:03:00,7971,The McDonald's down my street has been demolished and a new one is being built.   Didn't even know the hockey cards started again!
6665,Carp,2006-11-30 01:11:00,1488,Picked up 3 packs yesterday William.  Just got me curious when I read this post.  I'll pm you with the players I have.
