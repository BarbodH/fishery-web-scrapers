6655,Pigeontroller,2006-11-30 00:58:00,2793,"TJ, thats butchery of a Classic Marley lyric!"
6659,setomonkey,2006-11-30 01:04:00,872,"Nice to hear that it's worthwhile to take pics or video and pass the info along to the MNR. Better than ignoring it or possibly getting into a confrontation.  Keep us posted, Rick!  Mike"
6681,Ron,2006-11-30 01:38:00,1683,"Not sure where this is all going to end up, but it sure is a nice start! I can't really divulge any information on the situation as of yet. One thing for certain, this photo sure will get the word out to other poachers."
5951,bigfish1965,2006-11-28 15:52:00,3382,We see you...and so does the MNR. More to follow soon.
5952,douG,2006-11-28 15:59:00,2693,Ooooooooh.  A mystery!  I like mysteries.

5959,Roy,2006-11-28 16:12:00,13728,"If it's any consolation, it'll have been worth a few refreshes...."
5962,setomonkey,2006-11-28 16:24:00,872,"okay, you've piqued my curiosity...  Mike"
5963,bigfish1965,2006-11-28 16:34:00,3382,"Let's just say it is likely the conclusion we were working towards may happen. Not all parties involved have responded yet, so that's all I can say for now."
5966,Cookslav,2006-11-28 16:36:00,1457,Thats encouraging...
5967,yellowboat,2006-11-28 16:38:00,211,"That sounds promising, If it works out the Mods should think about an area where we can post our pictures of poachers ""THE WALL OF SHAME"""

5987,Beans,2006-11-28 17:28:00,3339,Better check with our resident mouthpieces before posting photos...you just might get T.J.s ass sued off !!!
5989,Terry,2006-11-28 17:29:00,14456,oh great they are going to fire all MNR COs and have volunteer junior rangers look after everything.....lol
5995,bigfish1965,2006-11-28 17:37:00,3382,Any picture you take in a public place is fine for reproduction on a web site provided the content is not copyrighted. It is only in places where there is expected privacy that you can run afoul of the law.
6002,misfish,2006-11-28 17:44:00,29133,"Interesting...........I was asked to sign a waiver this summer during a tourney just incase my photo was used on the WWW,so I couldnt sue them."
6003,irishfield,2006-11-28 17:48:00,26272,Is Lakair a public place or a place people expect privacy...LOL  I don't know whether to go back to the shop or sit here and click refresh..
6004,wuchikubo,2006-11-28 17:50:00,1114," Now Terry, you're dating yourself when you still use ""Junior Rangers"", I was in the last group called that.  They're are now upgraded in name to ""Ontario Rangers"" (the last I heard anyways).  WTG, Rick on keeping this up for the MNR COs!"
6012,ccmtcanada,2006-11-28 18:18:00,7971,"Darn it!!!  I read this at 1130, went to lunch...came back hoping for an update....oh well...hope all works out for the best!!!"
6039,walleyejigger,2006-11-28 19:03:00,876,"a bump in request for a progress report, WE WANT DETAILS"
6044,bigfish1965,2006-11-28 19:18:00,3382,"Here's what I can say so far. We were contacted by the MNR. They are investigating the images posted on another thread and they asked us for our cooperation as well as the cooperation of a few members. I am glad to say that all members contacted by us have so far agreed to help in any way they can. I won't say who the MNR is contacting on this, but those involved can speak up if they wish. The CO I spoke to is working towards putting together a case against the individuals involved. The MNR is taking this issue very seriously and expressed gratitude that anglers are aware of the need for all of us to help out when we can."
6049,Terry,2006-11-28 19:30:00,14456,"well, wouldn't that make you feel like a tall boy..."
6050,ccmtcanada,2006-11-28 19:30:00,7971,Very cool.  Great work everyone!!  Glad to see people walking the walk and not just talking the talk.
