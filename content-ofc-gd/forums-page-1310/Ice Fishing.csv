Heading  to one of my favourite lakes tommorow, looking for eyes through the ice! Seems very funny running in there with the 4 wheeler instead of the snowmobile. It was a big decision, lakers or walleyes, the eyes one. Will do Lakers on the weekend. Hopefully will get some good pics to share! I will think of you all.  Have a great day, I will !!!"

6329,charlied,2006-11-29 04:37:00,584,And how far North would that be....just curious.
6334,medic,2006-11-29 05:25:00,16,"Charlied,  Hearst is six hours north west of Northbay, most northern point of highway # 11 , or six hours north east of Thunderbay, six hours north from Sudbury. Basically in the middle of Gods country.  Irishfield,  I know Aurele well, a group of us get togethor for a friendly game of poker when its possible! Aurele is always invited, easy money for the rest of us !! Small world !!!"
