I was a member on the other board, however not as active as most of you. My real name is Dave, and I joined in April 2006 under yt11 and had maybe 70 posts or so. I am 21, I live in the great little town of Caledonia and am a 4th year Chemical Engineering student at McMaster. I enjoy fishing a variety of species, especially walleye (see nickname). Unfortunately I am home from classes sick this week, but I guess it gives me a chance to get caught up with the new board. I'm yet to recieve a few pics from some friends, but here is a little summary of my fishing year thus far.  Enjoy!  A few nice Walleye and a nice Laker through the ice this winter north of Temagami:    Some spring perch action in Long Point Bay:    A nice spring chinook on Lake Ontario:   Summer downrigging on Lake Erie:     Summer walleye from the Grand River:   This 30"" Walleye my friend pulled in north of Temagami made braving the tough wind and rainy conditions all worth while!:    Hopefully after exams I can get some winter steelheading in, and the ice season is just aroung the corner, so there should be a few reports just around the corner.  Talk to everyone soon!"
