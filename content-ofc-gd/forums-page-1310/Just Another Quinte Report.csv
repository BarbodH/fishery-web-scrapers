6248,Dondorfish,2006-11-29 01:30:00,1000,Well the skunk is finally over - but barely!  We launched outta the public launch behind the now closed Tip of the Bay. Real nice launch  We were out on the water and set up fishing by around 7 am. First fish was a medium sized pike that really fought well. Thought I was into a good walleye and was dissapointed when I finally got to see it. It was caught off the boards in about 45 feet of water using a deep diver perch pattern.   After that it was nothing for a couple of hours - then the rigger went off and I got a 6.3 lb walleye - not hugh by Quinte standards but it was good to finally get one. Walleye was caught on a glass perch ( purple ) down 32 feet off the riggers.         Thanks to Dann  ( skeeter ) for being such a great net man!  Don
