5961,Basskicker,2006-11-28 16:18:00,421,I recently purchase 2 Chronarch 51 mg's and was wondering if anyone else has used these lightweight baitcaster reels?  This is a review of the reel and an excellent site for reviews of fishing related products. It amazing the difference in prices from the U.S. and here.  I saved $268 on 2 reels.  http://www.tackletour.com/reviewshimanochronarch50mg.html  Jason

6005,trapshooter,2006-11-28 17:56:00,1234,I own that exact reel.  Have it on an Avid crankbait rod.  Love the entire setup.  Smooth long casts and lighter then anything.  You'll love em.
6025,Blake,2006-11-28 18:51:00,418,Your going to love the new reel.  They are truly incredible.  The write up on it was an excellent read for anyone looking for a great casting reel.
6031,Weedman,2006-11-28 18:55:00,32,"I have a Chronarch B myself which won a bunch of awards in 2004, the year it was launched.  Got mine at the Sportsman's Show for a great price.  They're $100 more to buy them now.  Didn't think that I could do better than my Team Daiwa Z, but that reel is golden.  Mine's on a new St. Croix rod as well.  Can toss baits with that outfit all day with little or no arm fatique.  I just bought up 12 St. Croix rods outta the US and saved some money.  Heading to Niagara Falls, NY to pick them up tomorrow, can't wait.  I will have some for sale, if anyone's interested.  We'll get them posted to Classifieds later this week hopefully."

6231,PatrickGG,2006-11-29 01:05:00,562,"Nice looking reel, I am hoping to pick me up one of those for next summer."
6285,Basskicker,2006-11-29 02:33:00,421,"I purchased both reels from Ebay for $249.99 (each)Canadian no tax, I checked at BassPro and the retail for $370+Tax (each).....just do a search on Ebay for Shimano Chronarch 51 mg and you'll see them...I believe his name is Reelseller or something close to that.  Ask him to ship them as a gift....It helps at the border.  Jason"
