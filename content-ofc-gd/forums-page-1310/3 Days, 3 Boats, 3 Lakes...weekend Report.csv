6572,Jigger,2006-11-29 22:44:00,1237,"Nice report, Bill. Good to see the COs in force!  BTW PM alert to you MBill."
6620,steve_paul,2006-11-30 00:18:00,658,"Good report Bill, sad to see 6B's away for the winter.  Good job again on the 'eyes.  Congrats"
6244,MuskyBill,2006-11-29 01:24:00,311,"I had decided to take 6B's to see my marine guy for Winterization on Saturday, but with the awesome weather we had, how could I pass up another run at The Bog before I dropped 'er off?  So, I arrived at the Port Perry launch, & quickly noticed 4 things, right away.  1. A boat out in the middle of the lake, presumably fishing???  2. A boat at the launch.  3. The Gov't dock has already been removed.  4. These guys...    When I got out of my truck, one of them asked what I planning on doing. I told him I just wanted to run up the lake to blow out the carbon & crud in the motor before she gets stored for a while.  ""No problem"", he says, & asked if I needed any room to back down the ramp. ""Nope, I'm ok, but what are those guys doing out there?"" I asked.  ""We're about to find out"" he replied. The C.O.'s had just called them in for a few questions.  SO, it turns out, the boat at the shore got dinged for fishing OOS. Buddy was taking his nephew out for a day, & thought The Bog was still open! It also turned out, the boat in the middle had THREE brainiacs fishing OOS!!!  In 5 minutes, 4 (four) charges, $240 each.....not too shabby for a days work!  Once I was in the water, I realized one more thing. Most of the lake had ice on it....    I had to go pretty far before I could find enough open water to open 'er up!      Once opened up, I quickly found out that I couldn't make it up the lake. Way too much ice to break....    Anyways, after a few minutes of wasting gas, I pulled out & dropped 6B's off at the mechanics, & found parking right beside out2llunge's vessel....     Sunday was met with more fantastic weather, but what was I gonna do? I had dropped the boat off! Fortunately, I still have some friends that still have their boats 'in season'. With the low-wind conditions, a plan was concocted to hit Lake O, near the Plant. I used to fish it from shore, about 12 years ago, but I'd never fished it from a boat.  Frenchman's Bay like glass...    Heading out on the big Lake....    Well, I had to resort to my old 'shore techniques', but it seemed they still work...    Even at night, the Sheepies like their minnows!      Because of a work-related schedule, I ended up getting the next few Monday's off, but will have to make up for it on Saturdays....  So, when I got home on Sunday night, I was excited to see my buddy Graham had his friend Frank from work cancel on him, last minute like, & an opening was created for another trip to The BoQ, for monster 'eyes.  When I got to his place @ 5:00am on Monday, he was just getting off the phone with his other buddy Keith who was ALSO cancelling...so, it was us against the Bay.  Here's where we stayed last weekend, & probably where I'll stay in the future. Fantastic breakfast!    We blasted out of Picton, heading towards the cement plant for the 2-line thingy....KIDDING Wayne!!!    Once past the ferry, we set out our puny 4-rod spread. Once the spread is out, in goes the sock...    I'm really diggin' the planer board stuff. It's really foreign to me, but everytime one gets clipped onto the line, it's like sending a soldier out to do battle....    Ya know what they say, find the bait...    .....find the fish....    Gotta love the smile! Graham's becoming quite the BoQ guy, his boat always sees success!  We had quite a hard time with one particular bait. Every now & then. the reel would do it's 'zzzz zz zzzzz z zz' thing, but there was never a fish on the other end!??!!  We wondered if maybe the fish were just getting off, or maybe after a while, the bait would go 'off track'. Who knows, who cares, we found fish. We were also surprised with the boat pressure out there for a Monday!  Doesn't anyone work anymore...."
6252,tjsa,2006-11-29 01:33:00,1578,"Nice report Bill, good to see the CO's, with their limited budgets nowadays, enforcing some specific areas."

6256,Ron,2006-11-29 01:39:00,1683,Nice read Bill.  Tis a sad sad day when you have to put your boat to rest. A moment of silence would be a nice gesture.  Some nice shots you got too.  Good to see the CO's out an about. Tis nice to see them there 240.00 tickets.
