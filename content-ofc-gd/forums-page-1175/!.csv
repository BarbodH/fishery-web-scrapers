96011,Hookset,2007-07-19 23:48:00,367,"Jeez guys, give him a break. You all know that Batman cannot reveal his true identity. or was that Superman ? Spiderwire Girl maybe ? damn, now I'm all confused.   Hookset."
96020,Muskieman,2007-07-19 23:58:00,2472,"12 pounds my ass!    I have a 22 1/2 on my wall i'm looking at right now, it weighed in at 6lb10oz. and was very fat when i caught it, as for the age , you can take a scale and count the rings like a tree to determine the age within a year or two, this works on bass that are over 15"" or so, i caught mine in Gull Lake behind River Valley my taxidermist said it was over 20 years old , i also have 2 x 20"" on the same peice of driftwood and he estimated those at around 17 years of age. as for the taste , Bass is'nt the best in the first place it must of tasted like a pair of wet muckluks, never mind the rubber boots. Are there any pics of this fish anywhere?  Randy"
96071,fishindevil,2007-07-20 01:40:00,6254,"Today i went to the O.F.A.H headquarters in peterbourgh...and i quote "" thats not a 12lb smallie""   he is known to have been saying that about fish he has caught in the past like a 19lb walleye ,a 50lb muskie,and so on....well nobody ever sees his big fish soi right away it would raise alarm bells.....the formula would make that bass round and prob not be able to swim at all.....its maybe about 7lbs....thats what they told me...so he is a scam......NOT  tRUE......why didnt he know about what he might have had...is he an IDIOT...well thats an easy answer??????"
96096,camillj,2007-07-20 02:16:00,1988,"All I can say is that if the fish he is holding is anything close to 24"" girth .. then he has 12"" fingers .... he's a GIANT !  My guess .. that fish is 4.5 TOPS"
96122,danc,2007-07-20 02:56:00,4677,"This story doesn't interest me at all. But I'd just like to point out the a few comments have said that if the girth was equal to the length, then the fish should have been round. Please take a moment to learn what girth actually means."
96127,Crazyhook,2007-07-20 03:11:00,1154,somewhere a reporter is hiding **
96134,silvio,2007-07-20 03:22:00,433,If that guy holds the fish any closer to the camera it's going to become part of it. Any closer and the only thing were going to see is 1 scale. No way is it 12 pounds.
96559,Rich Clemens,2007-07-21 13:19:00,3131,Yeah  .. I saw that pic in the Ottawa Sun while I was on the Rideau Last week.  There's something wrong with the photo ... it just doesn't look to be anywhere near 12+ pounds.  But ... I wasn't there.
96633,kemper,2007-07-21 22:08:00,2232,Dad caught a 22 incher last summer.  It was 4 lb 7oz.  So that 22 incher DOES NOT weigh 12 pounds
96739,singingdog,2007-07-22 15:35:00,1047,"I haven't heard anyone present this possiblity: the scale was set to Kg, not lbs? 12kg would be right about 5.5lbs, which seems fairly close to what that fish looks to weigh."
96742,Carmen,2007-07-22 15:50:00,72,"Actually 12Kg is more like 26Lb, I think the problem is he was using the old imagination scale."
96744,addict,2007-07-22 16:23:00,475,"what a tool.nowhere near 12lbs,probally half that its a nice fish to bad he ate it.those are the kinda fish with good genetics."
96748,irishfield,2007-07-22 16:39:00,26272, That's about the only part of this whole thing I'll believe....she'll do anyone!

96843,Roy,2007-07-22 22:47:00,13728,"2,000 + hits on a nice fish but certainly no record. I kinda feel bad for the guy now. Let's call this one quits."
96862,Rich,2007-07-23 00:03:00,3927,12lbs before or after he shoved the downrigger balls down it's throat?
96884,bushman,2007-07-23 01:31:00,23,
96892,danbouck,2007-07-23 01:46:00,4380,  Isn't that the pic you posted for opening day in June?
96895,bushman,2007-07-23 01:50:00,23,yes it was first day been on hollidays for 3 weeks lost track to the time
96949,LesCulpJr,2007-07-23 04:48:00,75,length x length x length 1600  =6.655lbs  but I doubt the measurements are actual looks alittle over 4 to me.
97155,keepinitreel,2007-07-23 17:50:00,15,I think buddy is on the pipe and should get to rehab
97548,singingdog,2007-07-24 15:10:00,1047, Oops! Thanks....I knew there was a reason that I don't teach math.
95782,Fish Farmer,2007-07-19 14:43:00,2234,"I have a 22"" smallie on my wall and it's 6 1/2 LBS."
95792,Hookset,2007-07-19 15:36:00,367,"I think the Ottawa Newspaper should be embarrassed for even printing the story. If they spent 2 minutes trying to verify, they'd come to the same conclusions as everyone on this board posted. That's something you would expect to read in the National Enquirer. Right next to the story about Paris Hilton giving birth to an Aliens Baby. If the dude who caught the fish has near to as much experience fishing as he claims he does, he would know it's no record. Or even close. 12 pounds my butt !!!   Hookset."
95805,steve_paul,2007-07-19 16:09:00,658," She didn't?????  Oh ya, forgot to add nice fish, not 12lb, closer to 6 but nice fish all the same."
95807,fishboy,2007-07-19 16:10:00,550,The only thing lamer (is that a word?) than him eating the thing is thinking it weighed anything over 7.5 lbs-and that's being generous.  Obviously the newspaper reporter has never caught a decent smallie.
95813,lakeman,2007-07-19 16:16:00,19,Biggest  Smallie......i caught    was pushing....20 inches.....wasnt even  5lbs...!!!

95836,mattyk,2007-07-19 16:58:00,2110,why would anybody eat such an old fish?
95838,icedude,2007-07-19 17:04:00,459,nice fish but not a chance-12 pounds--you're killin me here..lol!-we play that SMB Lake Simcoe game on a weekly basis--yesterday we tucked into them pretty good--3-4-pound range--10-16 FOW--shoal fishin-most success from a watermelon-colored Husky Jerk Rap--went snorkeling--water was 72 degrees--we saw some amazing SMB down there-water plays funny games but 6 pounders to be sure and some long pike--pike would follow every cast--no hook up  The Lake Simcoe Bass Factory will hold the world record in this anglers opinion  Tight Lines all!  Cheers!  ID1
95847,bassjnkie,2007-07-19 17:46:00,1101,"12Lb 6.5oz  I have a grafite mount 5Lb 2oz smallie and it looks similar in size. He's holding so far out,  Maybe next time he can put the fish in the camera. 12Lb my A##."

95888,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-19 19:30:00,2585,its a beauty of a fish!  But 12lbs is pretty unrealistic.  I would say it would be close to 7 but im seriously doubting the 24inch girth they claim.  That fish is easy 10 years old.  Wish he would of let it go.  Cheers!
95893,lookinforwalleye,2007-07-19 19:38:00,4399,I think it`s all been pretty much said but I will add the guys a fool and the paper should be embarrased for printing such a story.
95900,Handlebarz,2007-07-19 19:51:00,3790,Whoes eyes look foggier the fish or his? Maybe his scale starts at 6LBS good luck to him and by the way I want him on our team to do the measuering.
95912,Cookslav,2007-07-19 20:14:00,1457,If that fish is 12 pounds.... He's got a VERY happy Wife I'd bet (see the size of his fingers???) LOL!!!
95928,charlied,2007-07-19 20:53:00,584,Didn't someone in our fishing derby claim a 20 something inch bass....maybe thats a record too....LOL
95929,pigeonfisher,2007-07-19 20:56:00,696,I was there when he weighed it.  Happened to be passing through on business.  It weighed 12 6 on two scales.  Beleive 1/2 of what you read and none of what you hear!
95930,danbouck,2007-07-19 20:57:00,4380,I caught a 19 pound largie yesterday that was 21 inches long! Too bad I forgot the camera
95932,Weedman,2007-07-19 21:08:00,32,"Well, at least a couple of you caught the fact that the guy's fingers are the envy of any proctologist in the picture.  It's a classic case of camera trickery.  Matter of fact the fish is so far out from the guys body, I don't even think his elbows are bent.  The fish is 6 1/2 to 7 pds. max!! But, a very nice fish none-the-less.  It looks just a little bigger than my PB of 6 1/4 caught on a spinnerbait from an island saddle in Chemung 3 summers ago.  Can't believe the reporter getting snookered into printing that story....."
95935,ADC,2007-07-19 21:23:00,82,I think someone forgot to carry the 1 or something.  
95937,highdrifter,2007-07-19 21:29:00,2534,"Noice fish, bad wheight estimate...  Le gars y'est surement dans les patates!!"

95995,fishboy,2007-07-19 23:17:00,550,I wonder how he gets a hat to fit; maybe a cardboard box?  He needs to smooth the corners a bit there.

95703,Roy,2007-07-19 11:06:00,13728,"OK, I'll start. That fish is far from 12 pounds. It might be 6 pounds. MIGHT. It's still a nice fish just nowhere near the record books."
95704,Crazyhook,2007-07-19 11:11:00,1154,LOL!
95705,lew,2007-07-19 11:14:00,12767,Someone should tell him not to stand on the scale himself when he weighs his fish
95707,Jigger,2007-07-19 11:17:00,1237,"Good morning, great strory. That guy is going to feel bad once he realizes the kind of $$$ he could've got."
95708,OhioFisherman,2007-07-19 11:23:00,6623,Only 22 inches? I just don`t see it being a 12 pound fish.
95709,Tacklebuster,2007-07-19 11:28:00,303,"I have a hard time believing its anywhere close to 12 lbs.  Having caught plenty of salmon in that range, it doesn't compare in size.  Still a very nice fish, and too funny."
95710,Tacklebuster,2007-07-19 11:28:00,303,"I have a hard time believing its anywhere close to 12 lbs.  Having caught plenty of salmon in that range, it doesn't compare in size.  Still a very nice fish, and too funny."
95711,pikehunter,2007-07-19 11:29:00,1659,"Not likely a record bass, hard to believe it is that heavy, but it is one big bass"
95712,Whopper,2007-07-19 11:29:00,2174,If that fish was 12 pounds it visited Jenny Craig before the photo op. Nice looking smallie though.  Whopper
95713,Jay T,2007-07-19 11:33:00,282,There is no way that fish is almost 13lbs. Could he hold out that fish any further??
95715,mart,2007-07-19 11:40:00,93,Now that's a far fetched 12lber!!! Maybe 6.5lbs but not even close to the record. Compare it to this 9.83lber.... http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/fishing...tory?id=2931118 The two don't even compare. Wander how many pops he had   ????
95718,Crazyhook,2007-07-19 11:53:00,1154,"notice the girth is 25"" and the length is 22"" the fish would be round!"
95720,ccmtcanada,2007-07-19 11:54:00,7971,  oops.
95731,Roy,2007-07-19 12:12:00,13728,That fish makes dat boy's hands look HUGE!
95733,ilario,2007-07-19 12:18:00,166,i think its closer to 15lb...   mmmm... yummy sm
95735,bucktail,2007-07-19 12:19:00,1857,Thats a nice 5 pounder!!!!!!
95740,Zib,2007-07-19 12:26:00,369,If someone believes that fish is 12 Lbs. then I've got some ocean front property in Iowa to sell then.
95741,HotelTango,2007-07-19 12:28:00,21,"LOL, nice fish. But I do beleive the weight is a bit off LOL  Cheers Marc"
95748,rickster,2007-07-19 12:47:00,495,6 MAYBE 6.5LB still a nice smallie still wouldn't have eaten it still probably tasted like a rubber boot
95752,PatrickGG,2007-07-19 12:52:00,562,If it was a 12 pounder it would have easily been over 15 years of age and it baffles me how some people would eat a record fish.
95754,Dutch,2007-07-19 12:55:00,831,"Not 12, not even close.  Pretty crafty camera work holding it so far out from his body.  The scientists will tear that picutre apart once they analyse it.  There is no way that fish had a 25"" girth.  My wife's waist is 27"" around and that ain't even close.  I just wated 5 minutes reading that article - wish I had it back."
95760,oncogene,2007-07-19 13:06:00,154,... maybe that SMB ate alot of lead sinkers/weights lately... who knows
95762,ehg,2007-07-19 13:08:00,2666,"I caught a 23 inch smallmouth in Pigeon that was a tad under 7 lbs, so i'd think that was a 6.5 lb fish held right to the camera.  ehg"
95776,Tom McCutcheon,2007-07-19 14:09:00,627,I've got a picture on my wall of two 7lb. perch being held out at arms length.
