97098,Shaun Rickard,2007-07-23 15:46:00,144,"Anyone interested? I need a Spotter for the 2007 Tightline/Enticer Salmon tournament held out of Bluffers Park on Saturday August 4th  You will not be fishing and may not necessarily be in our boat, but you do get a free day on a boat and a chance to learn some great techniques on salmon fishing on the Great Lakes.  You will need to be at Bluffers Park by 6am on the day, we will be off the water by 3pm. You will also need to be available at 7.30pm the day before the tournament for the Captain and Spotters meeting, this will be held at the Dogfish Pub at Scarborough Bluffs.  Tightline Shootout website: http://enticerlures.com/Shootout/index.htm  Please PM me ASAP if you are interested in participating as a Spotter.  If you're not interested in being a Spotter but maybe looking for something to pass the time that day everyone is welcome to come and watch the weigh-in. I have a feeling that there will be some BIG Salmon coming to the scales again this year.  Cheers, Shaun"
97099,nautifish,2007-07-23 15:50:00,1416,okay what the heck is a spotter?
97100,douG,2007-07-23 15:52:00,2693,"That sounds like a great day on the water.  I just read the rules for that competition, and one caught my eye.  All fish caught may be subject to polygraph testing in order to maintain good conservation practices.  It's about time we put the onus back on the fish."
97150,aplumma,2007-07-23 17:42:00,6896,  I am so with you on this one almost 75% of the Catfish at the last tournament were found to have lied about their weight. ( strangely 100% of the 75% were wimmins type fisheeees go figure).   Art
