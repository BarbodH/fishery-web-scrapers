Last I heard they were collecting more samples. btw, a friend of a friend has a small fish pond in his back yard and lives on pigeon, He did a water change with the water and all the carp were dead byt he next morning, and they looked the same as the dead carp found in the lake. seems like it may be something in the water???"
