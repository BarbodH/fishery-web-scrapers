97764,Dutch,2007-07-25 03:55:00,831,"I have seen sooo many threads on this board ""discussing"" the laws and people asking for clarification on rules.  Usually those threads end up without a clear-cut answer or agreement.  Just goes to show that OPP/Local/Even some CO's (maybe) can't be expected to know the rules inside out.  I think they are vague for a reason.  As far as licences go, I buy a sport license even though I usually keep only perch and crappie within Conservation license limits - Why?  I hope the money goes towards funding the MNR."
97358,fishdawg,2007-07-24 01:19:00,912, totally agree.... there shouldnt even be a consv. lic. ( ontario is the only prov that offers one correct?) Im suprised the bloodsuck'n Govt has'nt figured out that it would be an easy way to make a couple extra bucks for our gas thirsty CO's to only offer a sports license....

97735,rapala14,2007-07-25 02:18:00,44,i've been pulled over by the OPP so many times now its not even funny.  half of'em dont even know whats legal and what isnt.  is fishing liscences and what not even part of there jurisdiction anyway?  isnt bodies of water a Federal matter not a Provincial matter?  i've always wondered this.  i even asked an OPP officer and he couldnt give me a straight answer.  but anyway as for the sport or conservation liscences.... i'm conservation all the way.  not gonna keep any of the muskies i catch.  only keep any other fish if its hooked deep.  so why would i spend the extra bucks for a liscence that doesnt suit me?  i'm not givin the government anymore money than they already screw me out of.  its not like those few extra bucks ACTUALLY goes to the MNR.
97749,bigfish1965,2007-07-25 02:52:00,3382," Yes the police (OPP or local) also have jursidiction over resource laws. It is clear that some of them do not have a complete grasp of the laws, and it's no wonder. We spend half our lives fishing (the other half wasted) and struggle with the laws sometimes. All monies from licenses and from fines levied on resource violtors does indeed go to the MNR. While the waterways are federally controlled, they usually direct reponsibilty to the province. The wildlife in the water is partly provincially regulated and part federally regulated."
