97429,Mike the Pike,2007-07-24 03:36:00,3421,Another bow fin .Man it takes me a week to catch that many fish  MTP
97484,bassman,2007-07-24 11:54:00,384,"I had no idea that bowfin put up such a nice fight, but man are they ugly. Good thing I got  lip grip.  I know the figures sound inflated, but it was one of those rare occasions where it wasn't called fishing, it was called catching.  Cheers!"
