97601,ilario,2007-07-24 17:54:00,166,Hi folks:   Anyone out there know what it would approximately cost to fix a crankcase gasket leak and a gear shift that only works intermittently? I wanna bid on an older 25 HP  Evinrude motor on ebay but I need to get a handle on the costs...  thanks

97613,BITEME,2007-07-24 18:49:00,1969,There is the doityourself option as well if you get the shop manual its eaiser than you think
97641,Zamboni,2007-07-24 20:56:00,235," Split crank, clean with acetone and apply omc sealant....under $20.  Gear shift-often the rod itself rusts out on those engines-flexing instead of shifting causing that intermitent prob....is ebay seller local so you can have a look? If its violently jumping out of gear that's different, more $'s....clutch dog-possibly new gears."
