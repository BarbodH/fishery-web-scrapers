Rented a cottage for the week, just North West of Perry Sound on Shawanaga Lake... boating, fishing, swimming and more fishing was my plan... not to mention a bit of R and R...  Taking the kids fishing has really nothing whatsoever to do with relaxation though! Their smiles were worth more than money can buy.  Although the lake didn't yeild the kind of fish I was looking for the kids were so very happy.  Enjoy the pics,                                        "
