I am very new to fish finders and was wondering if anyone can provide feedback or recommendations on whether it should be used in auto or manual mode.  I am fishing on Lake of Bays, a large and deep lake.  I am fishing for Pike, Smallmouth and Lake Trout.  Any recommendations are greatly appreciated."

You'd be surprised what you miss.  Then try it in the manual mode,  without fishing, just doodle around with it and notice the difference.  Remember what the sensitivity bar is showing in the auto and use about the same in the manual mode.  If you don't have the book, you can download them from the www.lowrance.com site.  And turn off the Fish ID if it has one."
