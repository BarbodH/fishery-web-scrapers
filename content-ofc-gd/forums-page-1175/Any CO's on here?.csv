Urgently need help with this!
97405,solopaddler,2007-07-24 02:49:00,8605,"Don't bother with the Tips line, call the O.P.P. directly, and take pictures of the offenders."
97406,bigfish1965,2007-07-24 02:50:00,3382,You can also call the Niagara Regional Police. I must be a pretty lousy fisherman cause I've never come close to catching over 100 fish there.
97407,Motorhead,2007-07-24 02:50:00,163,That`s Brutal....  100 --- 200 bass a day????  What the heck??? Hopefully someone see this and does something about it....
97410,bigfish1965,2007-07-24 02:52:00,3382,"I have a feeling the actual numbers are quite a bit less. Besides, anyone eating 100-200 bass will soon be quite unable to continue (they'll be dead from the toxins)."
97411,charlied,2007-07-24 02:54:00,584,LOL...true Rick..I am going in the AM with my video camera to record everything!
97450,Deg,2007-07-24 04:48:00,51,"Sorry to hear that you have the same problem in your area. Good advice call the police and take pics.  The Grand River has been getting hit hard from late April on.  I gave up with the MNR 3 years ago .. they never respond.  The OPP last year at least came and charged one with trespassing.  Unfortunately the fish were dumped when they drove in. A lot of large bass went out in coolers before the season started.  It's so blatant that they fish at the base of the dam in Paris all through May and the local paper took a picture and posted it with the headline ""Warm Weather Brings An Early Start To Bass Season"". That got a good response from honest anglers.  The editor printed a small apology the following week."
