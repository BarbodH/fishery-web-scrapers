97330,silvio,2007-07-24 00:23:00,433,I have an older outboard for my aluminum boat. I was wondering if buffing it would make it glossy? Or is there a way to paint outboards I have a spray gun? Also were can I possibly to get mercury decals for my outboard the ones on it make it need to go. Thanks allot.

The colour and font wasn't something that I've seen on a merc before.  Unfortunately, I don't know the answers to your questions as to where they got the paint/stickers.  On the positive side, the older and dumpier your motor looks, the less likely someone is going to ""pinch"" it."
