97538,yellowboat,2007-07-24 14:31:00,211,Well I found out on the weekend that the transom in the doral is rotten  .  My question is has anyone ever tied to use a product called Seafoam to replace a transom rather than the traditional method of plywood and if so how did it work out.  Thanks YB

I know what I'm getting into I don't want to do the job but there is know way in he** in paying over a grand to have someone else do it and I don't have the fund to get a new boat this tear."
