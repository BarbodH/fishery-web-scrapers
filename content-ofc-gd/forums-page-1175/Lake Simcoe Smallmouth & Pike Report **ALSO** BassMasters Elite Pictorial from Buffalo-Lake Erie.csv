Its been a jerkbait bite over 16-20 feet of water in the morning for aggressive fish, followed by drop-shotting later in the day. Multiple fish following after hookup and its been fun hooking the followers with Senkos.  Some not too shabby Pike on some of my traditional bass areas caught on Spinnerbaits and fighting real HARD.    Made it down to BassMaster Elite Series for the weekend and fishing was great too.  Highlight for my wife was meeting Mike Iaconelli. Great hanging with some of these guys and listening to how frightened some of them were in the BIG water.  Enjoy the below pictures...i gotta go ice my shoulder.  Bassmasters Lake Erie 2007-Buffalo  Mark"

Thanks for the Senko tip for followers, the last time I was at Simcoe that`s all I had was followers never thought to throw a Senko at them I will have rod pre-rigged with a Senko next outting."

97666,woodro,2007-07-24 22:27:00,168,"it looks like Xibit got a hold of those rides and pimped them out! Its too bad there is no money on the tournament curcuit up here, I would love to sport a rig like those."
97670,lookinforwalleye,2007-07-24 22:47:00,4399,Big money requires sponsors with deep pockets and sponsers with deep pockets want a good ROI and to get that you would need a good TV deal so they can promote their wares and I fear the market here is just too small.
97786,blaque,2007-07-25 12:10:00,2419,"whats funny is alot of the boats up close were pretty hammered actually. Which you could understand when you see them all tied up to each other when waiting to get outta the water, or just bouncin off each other when alll grouped up. I guess this is their work vehicle lol.........like a work truck, it gets a beating lol. You can see a nice chunk out of the right rear of that Advanced Auto Parts boat lol"
