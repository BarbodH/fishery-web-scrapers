97624,Fang,2007-07-24 19:47:00,1330,I've always been a Lowrance user but had a thought to pick up a seperate unit for back lakes and ice fishing.   http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...0001000_200-1-1   Any experiences good or bad? At that $ it's disposable!
97667,misfish,2007-07-24 22:34:00,29133,"Hey ya Fang.  I had a bottom line  years back. Never had any issues with it.Used both on the boat and on the hard water.For that price,I cant see ya going wrong."
97669,PERCHER,2007-07-24 22:44:00,787,Looks like a great deal to me.
97676,silveradosheriff,2007-07-24 23:09:00,1025,Have a buddy who loves them.....
97772,aplumma,2007-07-25 11:27:00,6896,Ran one for years no problem with the unit.   Art
97800,HookNrelease,2007-07-25 13:18:00,85,"I guess it must have been a typo as its disapeared today, just when i was gonna make the drive and get me one,,,grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"
97804,Roy,2007-07-25 13:29:00,13728,You guys watch Bottomline in the next coupla years. They're going to be a force to be reckoned with. They almost made it a few years back but now the big players are getting fat and lazy and starting to make mistakes.
97851,davis,2007-07-25 15:58:00,128,"I was at BPS last night to pick up a new fishfinder. The selection/stock is pretty slim from what the guy told me. I had a quick look at the bottomline stuff they had, but it didn't look like they had any available. Worth a call before you make the trip.  Oh, and good thing BPS price-matches - after I bought my Humminbird, i found out that LeBaron has it for $30 less! Now i just have to go back to BPS to get the difference back - saves me from making a trip to both stores."
97852,misfish,2007-07-25 16:01:00,29133,"  Roy you speak wize words. When they came out, they had the best pix,but IMO they priced themselves out of the market.  If they come up with a gps/sonar for a resonable price,Im getting one."
