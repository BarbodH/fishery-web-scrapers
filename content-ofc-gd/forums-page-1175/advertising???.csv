97235,Gerritt,2007-07-23 21:12:00,6129,What happened to the advertising in the upper right hand corner?? Just google ads now? Some of those banners led to some great info!   I should add all I ever see is the Sea-Doo ad.... is it just me?  Gerritt.
97266,TJQ,2007-07-23 22:12:00,7806,Ummm they are htere.... you must have an ad blocker working???
97272,ccmtcanada,2007-07-23 22:15:00,7971,"mine have disappeared too..hmm...I didn't enable an ad blocker...a pop up blocker yes, but not an ad blocker...."

97301,Rich Clemens,2007-07-23 23:11:00,3131,Hmmmm.. Digital Solutions.   Maybe that is how you can turn a 5-6 pound bass into something 2 to 3 times that size.    Now we know how he did it.  Just wait until I get my 70# musky.  Oops ... Memquisit is there now.   Sorry.
97302,TJQ,2007-07-23 23:13:00,7806,Im using firefox...
97304,Terry,2007-07-23 23:17:00,14456,really...they do not show up here... when on firefox but do if I go on iexplorer
97314,bigfish1965,2007-07-23 23:44:00,3382,They show up on my Firefox.
97324,ccmtcanada,2007-07-23 23:57:00,7971,"When bly is logged in the one in the top right corner appears, but when I log in they are not there....  Strange...."
97326,Gerritt,2007-07-24 00:02:00,6129,I am using firefox and not seeing a thing.... just Sea-Doo over and over....  Certainly there has to be a work around....They were working before w/ Firefox.... those ads pay for this site! I would click them because alot of them were useful and helped me choose destinations!  Gerritt.
97327,Bly,2007-07-24 00:04:00,1556,"Guess you just have to be ""special"" to see the adds"
97328,Terry,2007-07-24 00:08:00,14456,they don't show up in the default skin club skin they show up.......
97332,Gerritt,2007-07-24 00:26:00,6129,Terry you are quite right.... change the skin and they appear... it is not a firefox issue but a programming/CSS/Java? issue.... good catch and nice eye.   Gerritt.
97346,Terry,2007-07-24 01:00:00,14456,I hate an unsolved mystery ......
97364,bigfish1965,2007-07-24 01:23:00,3382,"I will disable teh default skin till we can find the issue. We had some troubles with the software before, so there may be a file pathway error."
97464,Terry,2007-07-24 10:02:00,14456,it's back I see ads
97473,Gerritt,2007-07-24 11:29:00,6129,Not working here with the driftwood skin.  Gerritt.
