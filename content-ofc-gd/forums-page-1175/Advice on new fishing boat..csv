97322,steve_paul,2007-07-23 23:55:00,658,"Nauti, I have a 19' Larson that I bought last fall all set up as you are looking for.  You ever want to go out for a day to see what you like and don't like, let me know and we can set something up.  It is docked in Port Rowan, we can hit the outer bay and go after some bows and eyes.  I'm not selling it but might give you more of an insight into what you want / don't want.  I bought it from a guy here, 1986 19' Larson, 4 electric downriggers, GPS, VHF, Sonar, Stereo, Top, 5HP Honda Kicker, etc etc etc for the price range you are looking at.  Let me know and maybe we can hook up and get out for a day.  I did buy it though in the fall after the season was over and he had already purchased a new boat, seemed then that the deals were a little better but that was when I was looking."

97448,Deg,2007-07-24 04:33:00,51,"Nauti, I have been looking for 'best boat' for 3 years and I think I have found the answer ... there isn't one.  I started with Lund/Crestliner/Starcraft, etc. and worked up to a fiber glass Grady White 208 (probably one of the highest rated by JD Powers over the years).  Not a boat to haul to Lakair but definitely suited for Lake Erie.  Finally I started looking at 'high end' aluminum boats .. I want to tow it. The Eagle Craft is great but I didn't win the lottery. LOL Finally found the one I like, a North River Seahawk.  It is heavier aluminum than anything we have here.  Made for the west coast rivers and Pacific shore.  Great fishing boat and definitely sets a high standard.  The trouble is, the closest dealer is Ohio and it has a few draw backs when you get into the options.  Example ... small bow makes a it difficult to mount an electric trolling motor and have an anchor well.  One boat doesn't fit all fishing styles.  All that said, I have been downrigging for several years with a 17.5 ft Starcraft (90hp) and often run to Long Point Lighthouse on good days.  Buy any solidly built boat, pick your days wisely, and if the weather turns bad, take it easy and find the safest route to port.  Rivets or welded doesn't really matter if you don't pound the crap out of it on every wave.  The one thing I would suggest for L.E. is bigger is better .. I would like at least a 20'er to get on the waves and not roller coasting between them.  Have you looked at a Habourcraft?  I have never been in one but have been told they handle the lake well.  Good luck and enjoy whatever you buy. Deg"
97466,Greencoachdog,2007-07-24 10:14:00,8163, Hey Mike!... if the hat fits... wear it!!!  
97486,Tacklebuster,2007-07-24 11:59:00,303,"I think if your going to be fishing primarily large bodies of water, your outings are always going to be weather permitting, unless you have a boat thats at least 30'.  I am bias towards Lund for a variety of reasons, but there are plenty of good boats out there.  A reliable motor that can get you back is as important as the boat.  One manufacturer I would stay away from is Bayliner.  They are nice in terms of cosmetics, but lack in quality as far as their materials.  Their fiberglass hulls are known for blistering, and their materials within the rest of the boat are of the lowest standard or non marine grade.  You definately want a boat with a deep V hull design,and a full windshield as well.  I have a lund 1700 with a 60 HP merc, and have spent many hours on L.O. and Simcoe, with the odd day I have had to turn around at the launch.  As long as you play it safe, keep your eyes and ears on the weather, most boats in the 18'+ class will give you plenty of hours of enjoyment."

I am looking to buying either a brand new or used fishing boat but must be ready for the water  needs no work and fully kitted for fishing   mostly  lake erie.  So i was wondering what all of you thought was the best out on the market right now?  I do not know too much about boats but am looking for something that will handle a bit of chop and seat 4 - 6 people & specifically for fishing.  Thanx so much.  Nauti."

97091,nautifish,2007-07-23 15:21:00,1416,ohhh BLIMEY!!!.....  I just want advice on a real good  fishing boat to buy.
97094,bigbuck,2007-07-23 15:23:00,2449,"4-6 people fishing on a boat on Lake Erie, you'll need something big, 18+feet, also, take into consideration what you have for a tow vehicle (ie. a Honda Civic won't be towing that). You'll need at least a 115 on the back because on the big lakes, the water can get rough quick when a storm blows in, you gotta get back to the dock asap. And the biggest question mark is how much do you want to spend????"
97095,BITEME,2007-07-23 15:27:00,1969,LUND!!!!!!!
97096,douG,2007-07-23 15:34:00,2693,"Just buy Wayne's boat.  Once it's finished, of course.  He can keep the snazzy jackets."
97097,nautifish,2007-07-23 15:41:00,1416,"Blimey!!   I am looking to spend between $6000 - $10,000 more if its the boat i really want, New or used as long as its ready for the water and as i previously said kitted up for fishing. I know how lake erie gets i live right next to it and fish it often. Which is why i am looking for a bigger boat for fishing.  Gerrit let me know if u got my pm i have no luck with pms on this site.....Grrr!!!"
97101,Gerritt,2007-07-23 15:55:00,6129,I got it and thank you Tracy.. I replied back  Gerritt.
97105,watertight,2007-07-23 16:06:00,50,I doubt you will find a new 6-10 people Lake Erie boat in that price range - but if you look around you may find a good used one. Erie is a great fishing hole. Good luck.
97107,watertight,2007-07-23 16:07:00,50,"Sorry, meant 4-6 people boat."
97109,Bcee,2007-07-23 16:18:00,25,I like the Bayliner 195.  Can get em like new for under 10 here in Cleveland.  I owned a Bayliner years ago and it was hassle free.  http://www.austinboats.com/printnew.php/37
97116,nautifish,2007-07-23 16:33:00,1416,I got it gerrit and thankyou.  Luckily watertight i live in a port town on lake erie there are allways good deals to be had but i am looking for oppinions as too whats a good boat. I am steering towards the trophy bayliner which i know is more money and as i said previously will pay more if its what i am looking for.  BCEE thankyou for the link.  Nauti.
97134,Bcee,2007-07-23 17:04:00,25,"Traci, If you are leaning towards the trophy, make sure you get the hard cover.  Its a better option than the bimini, IMHO.  Brian"
97135,davew3,2007-07-23 17:04:00,430,"Nautifish, for a boat for 4 to 6 people you may be limited to what you buy.  It will be a larger boat for sure. check out this site    http://www.trader.ca/search/default.asp?ca...yid=6&CAT=6  Good luck."
97146,charlesn,2007-07-23 17:32:00,551,"Nauti, you should definitely not discount looking across the pond.  boattraderonline.com is the site I used to find my last three bass boats, all purchased in the US and all when our dollar was significantly less powerful than it is now.  Your money will go further than it has in a long time against the greenback and it will be worth the hassle I bet because you will get a lot more boat for your dollars.  Lots of posts on OFC about how to deal with the border crossing too.  Good luck in your search, they say the best two days are when you buy the boat and the day you sell it.  Charles"
97174,Fang,2007-07-23 18:21:00,1330,"Hi Nauti  Defintely keep an eye on the boat trader sites.  I Fish Ontario and Erie in a 17'5 Crestliner and get wet and bounced around a lot. Even an 18ft aluminum like Lund, Princecrafts and Crestliners will be tight for 4 people and a full day fishing. 3 guys in my boat is enough.  If I spent 100% of time trolling I'd have gone fiberglass and more of a cuddy cabin  I was looking on line the other day and came across this one  http://www.trader.ca/Search/Details.asp?mk...;ADS=6275570%7C  Something like this would interest me if I was looking for a walleye/salmon trout boat for erie  just type in 18 ft to 20 ft in the search on the baot trader and see what comes up."
97181,bigfish1965,2007-07-23 18:29:00,3382,"I would not go on Erie in a Bayliner. Just my opinion, but I think they are terrible boats. In the classifeid section here, Shaun R posted a few boats for sale that look ready for Erie. You live on the shore, so you know how ugly it can get and how fast. What do you want to be in the day you get caught out there? You will get caught..it happens to everyone eventually."
97188,tonyb,2007-07-23 18:40:00,1637,The IPS 2 hulls on Lunds are designed to take a pounding in the waves...but Lund boats are not cheap.  Here is a quick reference for questions you should have the answers to when searching for a boat to purchase...  It assumes you are going with an Aluminum hull though http://www.lundboats.com/boatbuyingguide.html  Tony
97208,lookinforwalleye,2007-07-23 19:33:00,4399,Personally after an incident I had on Lake Ontario many years ago that put the fear of god into me I would not venture out on any of the great lakes in anything less than yacht.  How about a nice 40 foot tugboat there should be a few of those kicking around Port Dover might be kinda tough to tow however.  Good luck on your search for the perfect boat.
97214,pikehunter,2007-07-23 19:58:00,1659,"There is a Trophy that is at least 20' with a small cabin and twin 120 hp Mercs on it located in Burlington on Queensway Dr. between Guelph Line and Brant St. at a small motel next to the Best Western.  It sat covered with tarps for what seems like an eternity, presently it is uncovered but it never moves from it's parking spot. From the appearance, as I'm driving past, I would say the motel owner is the one that has it. There isn't a for sale sign on it but I bet it could be bought if he was approached. Might be an OK boat   This sounds like it fits your description of the ideal boat.  Just let me know if you want me to check it out for you."
