97632,Carpe Diem,2007-07-24 20:11:00,61,"Only in America!!! Lived in the USA for 2 years. Used to think to myself if you can't buy ""it"" here in America, then ""they"" just don't make it. Anywhere.  Thought at the time that was a good thing, by the way. Wouldn't want  to start any international incidents!!!!  Lived in New Orleans actually. A fantastic city filled with wonderful, welcoming people. What happened there after Hurricane Katrina, (and what continues to Not happen) is just wrong.  When i lived there, any excuse to have a ""Festival"" was a good one. Now people are lucky to have a roof over their heads."
