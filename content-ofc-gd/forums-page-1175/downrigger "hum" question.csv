97352,fishboy,2007-07-24 01:10:00,550,"I don't know what tune it's trying to play but my downrigger cable makes an audible vibration/humming noise. This is the first time I've used a downrigger & never having been on a boat with one, I wondered if this noise is normal. It's a clamp-on type rigger on an aluminum boat , so I'm thinking I need to put something to dampen the vibration between the rigger and the gunwhale. Any suggestions?"
97355,Nemo,2007-07-24 01:12:00,727,I think it is normal. The water across the wire creates a vibration.
97357,Dondorfish,2007-07-24 01:18:00,1000,yup - its normal   Don
97362,fishboy,2007-07-24 01:21:00,550,Not to sound too stunned but how loud?  The volume I'm getting is enough to make me wonder if it would spook fish.

97372,Deano,2007-07-24 01:32:00,767,"Yeppers, if the line's humming, your going the right speed. When you start to here the humming sound when downrigging, that's when you know your at the right speed. If it's humming really loud, slow down a bit."
97374,Fisherman,2007-07-24 01:33:00,7201,"If that noise spooks fish, then all the ones I caught were deaf.  That noise happens around 2.8km/h, seems to be the speed that salmon want the lure to go."
97404,sonny,2007-07-24 02:48:00,511,"the noise does not spook the fish it actually draws them in like an atractor,,,,keep em hummin!!!!"
97409,fishboy,2007-07-24 02:51:00,550,cool-thanks for the reassurance!
97489,lilkynan,2007-07-24 12:05:00,173,It is a lovely tune!! - I miss it - have not been out yet this year on Lake O -  Can you Record and send a file?? -  You can actually hear the tone change when a fish its - just a few tricks of the trade  Tite Lines!!!
97517,tonyb,2007-07-24 13:18:00,1637,"HUM = Good! Although if it isn't humming and you're catching fish, don't change a thing  Tony"
97546,douG,2007-07-24 15:01:00,2693,The answer to the question is obvious - it hums because it doesn't know the woids.
97590,bbog,2007-07-24 17:24:00,665,The humming is normal and I hear it while downrigging in my canoe. The tune is so subtle that I don't hear it at all when downrigging from a boat (over the kicker).
97696,Greencoachdog,2007-07-25 00:12:00,8163, Sheee-yiiiit!!!  I've always loved that answer!!!
97755,fishboy,2007-07-25 03:24:00,550,  Maybe it's the quietness of having a 4-stroke that makes the hum seem loud...
97796,Bob Devine,2007-07-25 13:13:00,251,"Fishboy that is the sound of the sea. The whine and hum is part of downrigging and will, not like the others stated scare your fish. Enjoy your experience, I find the pop of a downrigger and the scream of a reel awesome!! "
