97384,mepps,2007-07-24 01:56:00,1301,"My parents spent last weekend at Jack Lake, and my step dad got to do a little fishing. I gave him several spinner baits to use, but he didnt have any heavy gear, and stuck to worms at leeches catching several nice bass off the dock infront of the cottage.   It has been a couple years since I have been to Jack lake.  It was the Second Kawartha Lake I ever fished (behind Scugog) and we have been makign trips up to our friends cottage since the mid 90s.  I caught my first musky on Jack lake, and several more follow each time.  Our family friend Tom (the cottage owner) taught me alot about fishing when I was young, but we havent fished together in several years.  Gillian and I are moving out east to Nova Scotia in at the end of teh week, and had one last chance to get away and enjoy the beauty of Ontario.  We both decided there was no where else we would rather be then Jack Lake, so we called up Tom to set up one last fishign trip.  No better place to end our stay here in Ontario, by fishing the lake I have fished more then any other, and spend time fishign with the only person I knw who uses a Mepps Black Fury as much as I do.  We got in late Thursday (my birthday!) after a LONG drive.  We fished a little off the dock before the mosquitos chased us into the cottage. Fishing was pretty tough after heavy rain stroms passed through later that night (and ealier that day)  I managed a few decent bass, and after several hours of tossign spinnerbaits, finally found a Jack Lake musky.   Fished out of a peddle boat most of the trip!      Caught the biggest bass of teh trip right under the dock in about 1 foot of water...    Sorry team 5 - I had my ofncommunity.com paper with me, but it blew into  the water as I set up for this photo!   My first and last musky of 2007  Tom wasnt able to join us until Sunday, but we spent most of the day fishing with minnows and leeches (well he did, I used spinner baits) but fish were scare, awe each caught a few bass and perch.   All in all, a great way to spend the weekend."
97386,Nemo,2007-07-24 01:58:00,727,Sweet report. Thanks for sharing. Paddle boat Musky that has to be a new category. Nice work.
97387,007,2007-07-24 02:00:00,537,Nice pics and fish as usual Mepps.  Goes to prove your spinners catch more than just pike!  007
97388,mattyk,2007-07-24 02:04:00,2110,"nice pics, good luck out in nova scotia."
97390,solopaddler,2007-07-24 02:13:00,8605,"Man you guys sure have lived in a lot of places! Nova Scotia now eh? Well congrat's, that's a beautiful place to live and raise a child! Nice report as well and out of a paddleboat to boot. Just goes to show you a person doesn't need a $30,000 dollar boat to catch fish, you mostly need skill."
97391,Rizzo,2007-07-24 02:17:00,4754,One of these days I'll have to get me one of those dang black fury's (used em all the time as a kid actually...so that's one old lure we're talking about).  All the best on the east coast Clive
97394,mepps,2007-07-24 02:28:00,1301,"Thanks guys, we are pretty ecited about the move - maybe I can get into some of those blue sharks Aaron was catching!  Still looking for an IT job, but im sure something will turn up."
97421,tbayboy,2007-07-24 03:06:00,1497,Happy belated birthday and good luck on the move. I fully expect to see some photos of blue sharks with your spinners hanging from their mouths in near future
97422,bassmaster4,2007-07-24 03:08:00,801,great report nice fish and have fun in Nova Scotia
97437,Mike the Pike,2007-07-24 03:50:00,3421,Nice report and pics now I see why you called yourself Mepps  MTP
97440,Aaron Shirley,2007-07-24 04:09:00,655,"Clive, you lucky, lucky dog!  Blue Shark fishing galore man!  I really like Nova Scotia, it is a beautiful province.  I have been twice in the last 2 years.  No traffic and clean air.  Fresh snow crab and lobster, mmm.  Although the smallmouth and brook trout in the inland lakes are generally small, you have great muskie fshing close by in NB St.John River.  Striped bass fishing can be great, and Nova Scotia also has sea run brown trout and Atlantic salmon that are making a comeback.  The ocean is what really fascinates me.  Mako sharks can be caught as well on occasion while shark fishing.  Nova Scotia is a very interesting province, and I wish you well in your new home.  Congrats on the move!  Aaron"
97471,steve_paul,2007-07-24 11:04:00,658,"Must have been quite the job trolling for muskie in a peddle boat  Good luck on the move out east this week, hope all goes well out there for you two.  Looking forward to the East Coast reports."
97472,ccmtcanada,2007-07-24 11:28:00,7971,"What a great report mepps!  The great thing about the internet though is that just because you move, it doesn't mean we wont see you around here.  Great pics in this report...congrats on the first and last muskie of the season.  Good luck with the move...hope to see a report or two once you're set up on the east coast."

97913,redfin,2007-07-25 18:38:00,79,"Hey ""Mepps"" what's that lure you were using to catch those smallies??? LOL Nice report thanks. Good luck in Nova Scotia.
