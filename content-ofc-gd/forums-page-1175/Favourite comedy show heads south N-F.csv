97505,pikehunter,2007-07-24 12:46:00,1659,I was just wasting some time looking at Corner Gas clips on You Tube and came across a reference to Corner Gas being picked up by WGN Chicago.  CTV Release link  Clip  I like the dry humour the show and the laid back style of Brent. Now if we could get them to do an episode about fishing in Saskatchewan that would be great!

97600,pikehunter,2007-07-24 17:53:00,1659," I must have missed that one!  Trailer Park Boys is a different sort of humour again. I'm not a prude, but crap there is a lot of swearing in that. The UK version of the Office has a fair bit of language in it too, I saw a few episodes of it and thought it was really funny but was set back a little with the use of the ""F"" word. I was sort of surprised at the British openness for what I guess is a primetime TV show. Most of the Brit shows we see over here are a bit older than the Office so the language is not as bold.  Glad you enjoyed the Trailer Park movie English."
