93322,icefisherman,2007-07-12 14:14:00,952,"I hear the Temagami shoal map is useful tool to have while on my 6 nights fishing/camping trip in August. Unfortunately it seems to be priced very high at $25. All the other maps for the area were in the $6-$7 and I got the camping map from the Temagami Chamber of Commerce. Wandering if anyone has the shoal map scanned or maybe an old copy I can borrow for a week?  Thanks in advance.   Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
