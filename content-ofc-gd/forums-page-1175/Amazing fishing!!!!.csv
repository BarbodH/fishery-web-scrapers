96918,fishingguy28,2007-07-23 03:22:00,98,"hey guys, a buddy and i went out to a small lake we know yesterday in hopes of catching a few buckets... 8)  8)   i gave hime a trusty top water that i knew would be successful due to the conditions when we arrived.... about 2 mins after we started fishing the magic of the top water lure had begun....   here was a little guy to start him off    a few casts later and the size increases a little!!    and again    it was about time i was thnking  of putting on of those bad boys on...  but i didn't.... i wanted to try out some new baits i had purchased... which i never ended up catching any fish on.... if anyone has any pointers of successful techniques used to fish horney toads (zoom) let me know!!!  anyways there was about a 2 1/2 hour lull where nothin was caught....we had a little snooze on the boat and then i thought i would give it one last crack.... here are the results.....      each of us with our double header pic!!  and then i started to DOMINATE!!!!          it was a great feeling..... i found a system that was working, stuck with it and it paid off.....all fish were released to catch another day!!!!!!!!   hope you enjoyed the report!!!!!"

96957,Rich,2007-07-23 10:47:00,3927,"Wow, the incredible ""increasing size"" pond/ If you stayed out there til this morning your fish would probably be into the 20 lb range! lol  Great report, looks like you had a blast!"

96977,ccmtcanada,2007-07-23 11:57:00,7971,Wow!  Great report and some really NICE bass you got there!  Congrats on a great day out there.
96988,charlesn,2007-07-23 12:17:00,551,1 simple tip for the horny toad.  Keep throwing it.  It's one of the best baits on the market.  I don't leave home without em.    Charles
97012,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-23 13:12:00,2585,those look ike some awesome bass!  Great report!  Cheers!
97014,fishingguy28,2007-07-23 13:13:00,98,"well that's what i have heard about the horny toad, resulting in me buying about  6 packs in various colours.... i noticed when i am casting them out there however they tend to sink and sometimes turn over... is thos ok or should i be presenting them different???  i am rigging them weedless with a 5/0 wide gap hook or corkscrew hook...  thanks for the info...."
97046,charlesn,2007-07-23 14:28:00,551,"I fish em on 65 lb braid with an Owner 6/0 EWG.  They will sink if you are not retrieving them but I've caught them while they are sinking as well.  They will turn over but it's not a big deal.  Often once it is chewed up, I'll flip it over and re-hook it to get a few more fish out of it.  Charles"
97265,fishingguy28,2007-07-23 22:09:00,98,alright that pretty much what i was doing... guess i'll just keep pluggin away until i get confident in the bait!!!!!
97271,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-07-23 22:15:00,0,Nice job! You'd be surprised what kind of monster bass live in Ontarios smaller lakes.
97351,fishingguy28,2007-07-24 01:08:00,98,i know i love fishing the smaller lakes rather than the bigger ones.... you dont have to worry about weather conditions nearly as much!!!!!!
97373,Aaron Shirley,2007-07-24 01:32:00,655,"Nice buckets you guys got into, nice work  Aaron"

97459,fishingguy28,2007-07-24 08:47:00,98,hey .... when i have a day like that i gotta share it.... lets just hope there are many more to come!!!!!!
97462,Rich Clemens,2007-07-24 09:56:00,3131,You caught more bass in one day than my wife and I did in an entire week ... last week.   Way to go with finding the right combination to trigger strikes.  Nicely done.
