97547,douG,2007-07-24 15:06:00,2693,"I'm thinking that this was another Boois trip, as they have an outpost on Joyce lake.  Glad to hear that your trip went so well."
97586,ADC,2007-07-24 17:10:00,82,Holy Pike!  500 fish in a week! thats crazy!  Between 2 people at 8hrs a day for 7days thats an average of 1 fish per every 10minutes.  Thats my kind of fishin!
97765,Letpikego,2007-07-25 03:57:00,29,It was a really amazing.  We would find a weed bed where we would catch a Walleye or get a bite a on every cast with the occasional pike- over 30 inches.  Since when do they hang out together?  When we fished in weed beds we used Johnson silver Minnows with a yellow twister tail.  My son pointed to an eagle and told me to get a picture.  While I was messing with the camera a fish hit my silver minnow dangling in the water next to the boat.  I almost lost my rod.  It was a 36 inch pike!  We have already set up our reservations at the same place for next July.  God blessed sunset country in Ontario.
97878,Whopper,2007-07-25 17:00:00,2174,Got to love those outpost lakes! Awesome report and I'm sure it's one that your son will not forget. Congrats!  Whopper  PS those pike aren't hanging with the walleye that's their dinner
