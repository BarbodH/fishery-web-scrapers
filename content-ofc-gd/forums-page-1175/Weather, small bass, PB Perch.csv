Forgot the camera some days, didn't bother bringing it others since it is a pain taking pics when solo. Decent weekend bass wise. Found most of them deeper than normal for this time of year. Boated nine last night in a little over two hours (no camera). Most were smallies in about 12 feet of water and almost all of them were caught on a wacky rigged white worm drifitng to bottom.  These shots are from a couple of morning when i sneak out prior to kids waking up. Small bass but pretty sunrise.  A shot of a storm rolling in across the lake.  And for the finale, my PB perch caught this morning off the dock while I sipped a coffee. Caught on a # 2 hook with about 3 inches of stale worm I found at the bottom of a container. I marked the fish on my rod and measured later and the fish was between 15 1/2 and 16 inches.     "
