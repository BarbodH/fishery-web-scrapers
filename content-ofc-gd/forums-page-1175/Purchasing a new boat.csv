97331,Gerritt,2007-07-24 00:24:00,6129,  Think Bass Boat.... alot of them have that design as well.... is moves the motor a touch more to the centre and it pops up on plane almost instantly... it looks different on an aluminium... but is very functional  Thanks MM... this weekend cant come soon enough!  Gerritt.
97336,Corey,2007-07-24 00:40:00,355,"nice boat, wish i could come for the ride. as a side note, my place is on the way to the lower grand."
97338,Daplumma,2007-07-24 00:47:00,1961,"Looks like a stout boat,should serve you well.Thought Bernie would be involved when you said it was up north. Joe"
97353,Lostchild,2007-07-24 01:11:00,153,"Congratulations,very nice looking rig!  The one thing I did notice though is you are going to need to add some navigation lights to her."

97871,Jen,2007-07-25 16:33:00,833,"Niice... very very nice...  Congrats on finally finding something that you like...  Look forward to all those fishing reports to come.  Just a side note... For just under $200.00 dollars costco has those storage garages on sale... 10X 20, that way you have somewhere to store the boat and putter around in when it is raining outside. Kinda like a portable garage.  Cheers and again  Congrats  Jen"
97885,kennyman,2007-07-25 17:25:00,737,"Congrats on the new toy. Looks perfect to me. Nice size,storage etc. That thing should FLY with that 40 on there. Have a great weekend captain."
97904,Gerritt,2007-07-25 18:11:00,6129,Thanks for the heads up Jen!  Gerritt.
97914,Garyv,2007-07-25 18:39:00,547,"Buy it you'll like it!  Just looked at a used package today for a friend.  16 Ft alum with a 40 Johnson 4 stroke.  Motor is 2 years old, boat is well used asking price $9000.  Don't know what your deal is but if your satisfied thats all that matters."
97055,Gerritt,2007-07-23 14:49:00,6129,"Well as most of you know My old boat has finally given up the ghost.. She was a fine ride and served me well. I always knew she would be temporary until I could afford something else...  Well I have found something else  And if all goes well she'll be mine on Friday!  I had a good friend put her through the ropes, to make sure it was packaged properly etc. and the results were glowing! and trust me this person knows his boats. He did this to make sure it was what I was looking for before I make the 3 hour trip up north to put her through my test  I will be heading up this Friday to give her a good run and to deal with the paper work should I think she is the boat for me... which by all accounts I am 99.9% positive she is as I have done alot of research on this brand and model... I have yet to hear one single complaint about it..  Well here she is... a brand new 2006 Polar Kraft 17',Brand new Trailer, The motor is a 1993... however this motor has less then 10 tanks of fuel ran through her and is in almost new condition it has electric start and power T/T... I still need to add my trolling motor and sonar etc to her... here she is bare bones.               I appreciate everyone's offer of deals on their used boats etc.. It was certainly appreciated! But I am getting this at a fair price and got a fantastic financing offer...  This is my first Brand New boat purchase.... I am a bit excited as I am sure you can tell through reading this post..  Again I would like to thank everyone that PM'd me offers, Trips out and even one person Loaning me their boat! you guys are the best.. thank you!"
97058,tonyb,2007-07-23 14:52:00,1637,Congrats Gerritt! You must be totally pumped and smiling ear to ear  Something like 200+ more sleeps until I can feel that rush...  Tony
97062,ccmtcanada,2007-07-23 14:55:00,7971,Gerritt...wow...sweet looking boat!!!  A very nice upgrade from your last one.  I'm sure you'll be boating lots of great fish in this one.  Maybe you'll have to take me out again so I can catch a bigger muskie...LOL.  Congrats Gerritt...this community really is the best as attested by you in your post....enjoy the maiden voyage...I'll expect a nice long report with pics of you in your new ride!
97063,ccmtcanada,2007-07-23 14:56:00,7971,Double post...oops...

97075,Joey,2007-07-23 15:07:00,9122,Very nice Gerritt.  That's a sweet boat.  Congrats.  Joey
97108,BFSC Kevin,2007-07-23 16:17:00,1351,"very nice upgrade gerrit!, just wondering, how much are you paying for it if you don't mind pming me."
97114,pikehunter,2007-07-23 16:28:00,1659,They are a nice well made boat. If you decide to make this purchase I'm sure you will be happy with it.  BTW you have a PM...
97118,John,2007-07-23 16:35:00,2956,Sounds like a terrific opportunity Gerritt. Good luck. That 40 should give you lots of power.  John...
97120,Gerritt,2007-07-23 16:37:00,6129,"Hi Kevin, I would love to divulged  the price I am paying... But I am unable to at the moment as I would not want to upset the person selling me the boat... I will ask him if it is ok (I am getting a deal after all)  and if he says no problem I will sing it from the rooftops LOL  I am sure you understand.  Gerritt."
97122,BFSC Kevin,2007-07-23 16:42:00,1351,not a problem at all.. jst wondering.. not bad of a set up at all.. maybe i'll move to something like that later on when my 14 footer breaks down... but i think i would want a console.. getting tired of holding the throttle..lol
97137,aplumma,2007-07-23 17:10:00,6896,Nice boat Gerrit looks like a boat you can slime and then take a garden hose to bring it back to new. If you get a chance while you are testing it make sure it does not have alot of rattles or that the hatch cover gaskets don't leak when they are in the closed position. Dont forget your buddies when we come up to Lak Air next year we need someone to show us the unicorns I mean Muskies they have their.   Art
97141,dustink,2007-07-23 17:23:00,526,Congrats!!  That is a sweet looking boat....  dk
97145,Gerritt,2007-07-23 17:31:00,6129,"Well I thought I would pass on who it is I am purchasing it from... Give credit where credit is due  I am dealing with Giesler Marine in Powassan, Bernie's (Nipissing) Family owns it...  They have been great in answering my never ending thousands of questions and have shown a awesome amount of patience in that regard.  Bernie was awesome in taking it out for a weekend to make sure it is what I would want ... and to make sure things worked as they should.  Larry (their salesman) is a great guy and a straight shooter. I would recommend my grandmother to him if she was purchasing a boat. He is that good.  I am heading up to Powassan this weekend for a weekend of Fishing and hopefully getting some slime on her  Those of you that met Bernie @ Lakair know what a great guy Bernie is... it made my decision on where to buy my boat an easy one.  Not to mention it is best to keep things in the family.... The OFC family.  Gerritt."
97152,douG,2007-07-23 17:45:00,2693,"Sweet, Gerritt.  I hope all goes as well as possible for you this weekend.  Good Luck!"
97179,Rizzo,2007-07-23 18:27:00,4754,I've got one like that with a 15 hp and it moves pretty good.  That thing should fly with a 40!
97240,Gerritt,2007-07-23 21:20:00,6129,"  Cliff you and Carole would be more then welcome in my boat any day of the week... Hell your better company then alot of my fishing buddies! LOL  Thanks,  Gerritt."
97246,danc,2007-07-23 21:28:00,4677,Nice looking ride Gerritt. I'm sure you'll get many years of use from it.
97248,steve_paul,2007-07-23 21:29:00,658,"Gerritt, congrats on the new ride.  She looks great, looking forward to your reports from her.  If you are ever want to bring her down to Long Point, let me know and we can hook up for a day on the bay."
97270,Sinker,2007-07-23 22:15:00,8692,"That is a perfect boat. Very similar to mine. Easy to launch alone, easy to handle alone, and it handles big water very well.  I get 32MPH on GPS with a full floor, 2 batteries and a full tank of fuel, trolling motor and 2 big guys.....mine is a 40 mariner......on a 16.5 starcraft.  I'm sure you'll be more than happy with it. I love mine for its versitality!!  Sinker"
97278,Greencoachdog,2007-07-23 22:19:00,8163,That looks like a great boat Fat Boy!!! You oughtta be able to really slay the Perch and Gobies in that thing!... and if you're real nice to me... I'll teach ya how to catch Wall-ice in it next year at Lakair!
97309,JFR,2007-07-23 23:30:00,498,"very nice looking rig, you'll enjoy it for many years  Thanks for sharing  John"
97318,Pigeontroller,2007-07-23 23:49:00,2793,"That looks like a great boat, lots of room to customize, pick up a Cabelas Marine catalog and see what you add to make it the ultimate fishing machine! Strange looking transome though...I've never seen that design before?"
97320,musky_man,2007-07-23 23:50:00,159,"Gerritt,   That should give you many years of fishing pleasure - congrats, my friend!"
