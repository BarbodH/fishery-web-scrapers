97348,Nemo,2007-07-24 01:05:00,727,My cousin is in town on vacation and his neice deleted all the vacation pics on his camera.   I have heard you can restore them. Does anyone know what program or service to use?  I have googled a bit but was wondering if any OFC'ers had some thoughts/suggestions on this issue.  Thanks in advance.

97476,Tacklebuster,2007-07-24 11:34:00,303,"snap files data recovery, if you google it, you should be able to find it and download it.  Its free, not a trial version, very simple to use, fast, and can recover most file if they are not too old.  I had a similar problem, tried all kinds of programs and this was the only one that worked, it even recovered an excel document that was lost 6 months ago, which I was very happy about because it was my fishing log . If you are interested pm me and I will email it to you."
97834,Seaweed,2007-07-25 15:01:00,135,Man I wish I would have thought of this last year.  I caught the Walleye of my life and had a couple of great shots of her.... until I tried messing with the file delete function at two in the morning as I was drooling over the pictures.  I will try to see if I can still get the deleted shots off of my photo card though... you just never know.  Thanks to everyone for posting this info.
