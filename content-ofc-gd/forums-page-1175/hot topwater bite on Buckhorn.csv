96719,Jer,2007-07-22 14:19:00,1426,"My girlfiend's son, Brandon, & I went out last night for just a quick fish before dark.  The wind had calmed down nicely so I was looking forward to a good topwater bite. I wasn't disappointed. I was throwing my favourite Pop'R (firetiger) while Brandon sped things up with a buzz-bait.  The slower presentation of the popper seemed to be the key. While Brandon only managed one LM about a pound and a half, I must have caught at least a dozen bass (all LM) including these two beauties, both solidly over 4 lbs:     In our haste to get out after dinner, we forgot the camera, so I brought them home in the livewell for some pics, both fish were safely released (hopefully to take up residence under my dock, lol). I've never caught two 4+ bass in one day before, never mind in less than an hour.  Here's hoping for another calm evening tonight."
