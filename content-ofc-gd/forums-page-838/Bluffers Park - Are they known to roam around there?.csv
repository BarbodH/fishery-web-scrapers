348162,rbaquial,2009-06-04 06:02:00,968,"Hey OFC'ers,  Just a quick question - Does anyone know if BLUFFERS PARK in SCARBOROUGH have MUSKY rolling through the area? The reason I ask is because, I know Pike are known to be there.  If anyone can supply an answer - it'd be great!  Thanks in Advance! RoB"
348163,cram,2009-06-04 06:09:00,1733,"Yep, and tarpon."
348164,rbaquial,2009-06-04 06:13:00,968,"I don't know if I should take you seriously or not... The simple fact you said Tarpon (from my understanding, are only available in Sea Waters) confuses me :s   **Are we thinking of the SAME 'TARPON'??**  PS: I'm sorry if that sounded rude - Just really confused when you said ""Tarpon"""
348172,Weeds,2009-06-04 09:43:00,782,He's pulling your leg about the Tarpon and I've never heard of anybody catching musky there.
348176,siwash,2009-06-04 10:40:00,683,"Maybe not Bluffers, but you never know what you might catch along toronto's waterfront or anywhere in Lake Onario for that matter... What has been confirmed is the presence of musky in and around Toronto's Islands... That is an MNR confirmation... mind you, you're not likely to catch one b/c they're rare"
348205,BITEME,2009-06-04 12:07:00,1968,"there has been a couple caught around the west end of the O over the last couple years smaller 48"" but very promising they were not targeted it was incidental catch"
348600,rbaquial,2009-06-05 04:50:00,968,LoL Thanks Guys
348604,cram,2009-06-05 05:18:00,1733,"Sorry about the tarpon comment.  I was being too cheeky.  Anyway, there are musky in lake ontario but for whatever reason tehy are incredibly unplentiful.  You could likely fish for them every day of the season (or 5 seasons) and never see a fish.  You're MUCH better going for pike (you've never caught one, right?) and enjoying that.  Try for musky if you're ever in the kawarthas where they're plentiful. Otherwise, enjoy fishing more plentiful species."
348605,rbaquial,2009-06-05 05:21:00,968,hehe - no problem!  I caught my 1st pike already  can't seem to find the post - but here's 1 of my posts...  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...mp;#entry344059
348670,leighfns,2009-06-05 15:10:00,103,I know they come in the Bay of Quinte from Lake O(not alot of them but some big ones) although these are likely fish that would otherwise be in the St Lawrence.
348676,BillM,2009-06-05 15:48:00,17367,Your best bet for muskies in Lake O will be the Niagara river area.
