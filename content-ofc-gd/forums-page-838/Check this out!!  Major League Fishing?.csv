348515,TJQ,2009-06-04 23:38:00,7806,"GREAT news for our good friend of the board!!  -----------------------------------------------------  Major League Fishing? Professional Angler Dave Mercer to Throw First Cast  June 3rd, 2009 Port Perry, ON  Dave Mercer Outdoors Inc. is proud to announce that history will be made on September 21st, 2009. For the first time ever in major league baseball, the opening pitch will actually be the opening cast, cast by professional angler and host of television’s Facts of Fishing®, Dave Mercer.  This historic cast will take place right before the Toronto Blue Jays take on the Baltimore Orioles at home in the Rogers Center, downtown Toronto. Obviously, this is not the first spot one would think of when planning a cast, but this will come as no surprise to Dave Mercer fans as the fishing funnyman has made a habit of bringing his beloved sport to mainstream audiences.  Dave Mercer stated, “Not only is this a dream come true because I’m a huge baseball and Toronto Blue Jays fan, but I feel it’s a great opportunity to put the sport of fishing in front of a lot of people that may have never fished. I am also elated by the support I have received from the Blue Jays, turning this historic event into a fundraiser for Casting for a Cure.” Fishing and baseball fans alike will have the opportunity to take this historic event in from the Facts of Fishing® section at the Rogers Center, where, after the cast, Dave himself will be taking in the rest of the game with family, friends and fans. Thanks to the Toronto Blue Jays, a portion of the proceeds from this section’s ticket sales will be going to Dave Mercer’s Casting for a Cure benefiting the Canadian Cancer Society.  Blue Jays Quote: Jason Diplock from the Toronto Blue Jays Baseball Club states, “The Toronto Blue Jays are thrilled to have the opportunity to work with Dave and his team at Dave Mercer Outdoors Inc. This promotion allows us to showcase two great summer activities while raising funds for a terrific cause.” Tickets are $20.00 and may be obtained at www.bluejays.com/specialevents or by calling 1-416-341- 1234.
