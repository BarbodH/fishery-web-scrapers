348130,ohhenrygsr,2009-06-04 02:58:00,947,Have fun with the pike Big too
348196,Stoty,2009-06-04 11:50:00,2910,Is there anything on the Lake that I need to watch out for (boating wise) ?
348242,steverowbotham,2009-06-04 13:32:00,1800,"just follow the marker buoys and you'll be fine.  the pike fishing has been awesome, walleye fishing is tough, but there are some fish to be had."
348342,bigbuck,2009-06-04 17:28:00,2449,"Stoty, there are really big pike in there, my buddy caught a 22lb'er on May 2-4 weekend, it was quite the battle bringing it in. As for walleye, I've heard it's really tough. Good Luck."
348714,Stoty,2009-06-05 18:20:00,2910,"22lb?!?! WOW! I'd LOVE to hook into one of those bad boys!  I'll be at a cottage on Acton Island. Any decent spots around there?  I took a peek on my GPS and noticed that the lake is REALLY deep. I assume hitting the first major drop off from shore, is a good bet for the Pike?"
348715,muskeybugged,2009-06-05 18:24:00,282,"I hear the lake is about as hot as the Red Wings in game 3 & 4!!!!  Had to after reading the ""other"" post.  Best of luck with the fishing.....not so much with the Series..."
348718,Stoty,2009-06-05 18:29:00,2910,Hahaha  Thanks.
348733,johnnyb,2009-06-05 19:15:00,3413,"Head for the outlet of the Muskoka River, if it's nearby...been hearing some excellent reports from that area."
348736,Stoty,2009-06-05 19:29:00,2910,"Sweet, thanks for the tip. I'll check out where that is."
348776,solopaddler,2009-06-05 22:02:00,8605," Scrolled down quick to see if anyone'd mentioned it. Yes the delta area of the Muskoka river is a key spot. Also the delta area of the Indian river. Earlier in the spring they'd be in the river, now they're likely dropping back. Troll the muskoka river at night for walleye."
348793,musky66,2009-06-05 23:25:00,273,Check the regs- muskoka river has a closed season. There are Walleye in there- took us many years but my son and I have our spots. The closed season on the river has contributed greatly to the comeback of the 'eyes.
348962,siwash,2009-06-06 20:10:00,683,  Is the outlet near St Elmo? I believe the east side of the lake...
