I joke a lot in life and when I come on here it will be no different.  In picking on someone's spelling or taking a poke at fishing ability I'm just trying to have a laugh.  I hope that sort of makes sense.  This isn't an ego thing and meant no actual disrespect. I also don't see what age has to do with anything.  As much as you expect to be respected for your age, I expect that being 28 is not something to be patronized for.  Looking back on this thread I think I did state my actual opinion pretty clearly, and most of what I said is in fact valid. If my opinions don't sit well with you that's your right.  I think maybe if you lightened up a little you'd see that I'm not snide nor egotistical...just a guy who stated his opinion and had fun along the way."

NICE GCD, post shoulda been closed after your comment, cuz it hit the nail on the head. "
348554,Guest gbfisher,2009-06-05 01:41:00,0,Horizontal or vertical?  .............................Neither! Just hoise em up by their eyes like a bowling ball.
348572,Jigger,2009-06-05 02:41:00,1237,I find that bigger fish of most species tend to be more calm when held horizontally. You can hold a walleye or bass by the belly without the distended jaw hold or gill hold. They're more often than not fairly docile in this hold. Vertical holds and tail grab holds seem to piss them off more.
348586,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-05 03:12:00,0,"here's a study on various factors that contribute to fish mortality...no specific mention of horizontal vs vertical, but interesting none the less... http://www.acuteangling.com/Reference/C&RMortality.html"
348593,pike slayer,2009-06-05 04:16:00,1177,"the one thing i dont understand the whole point of this is when you set the hook you are pulling on the fishes mouth and reeling in the fish is fighting and trying to pull away. Doesnt all this tugging and pulling cause strain maybe even more then holding the fish vertically. also what about those bass fishermen in tournaments that dont have the time to net and just pull the fish up and flop it in the boat with just the rod? alot of small fish i catch i do the same, if its pike, bass, walleye, specks, etc. that must be causing more strain on the fish. also when holding the fish horizontal and the fish starts to thrash around and go crazy in my hands i end up squeezing the fish tightly, maybe to tightly and it just happens on accident cause im sure dropping the fish isnt good at all. now when i squeeze the fish they've crapped themselves and im sure thats not very good for them. im not so sure its a bright idea holding them horizontal squeezing their guts, i could be wrong..."

348319,muskymatt,2009-06-04 16:15:00,2608,"Nothing wrong with holding the smaller fish vertical as they don't have the weight to cause damage from the vertical hold. Once they have weight and mass a vertical hold puts too much stress on the jaw and can damage/break it. The vertical hold can also cause the guts to slip to the bottom of the fish causing internal damage..the guts are basically weightless in the water, once out of water and held vertical the gravity on them is too much for them to stay in place.  That being said an improper horizontal hold can be just as bad. If held by the head and extreame end of the tail the back can arch and cause damage.  The hold imo that makes most sense is a gill plate hold with one hand with the back hand either at the back fins or on a bigger fish a cradle hold..but then slime can be removed....sometimes you just can't win  Bottom line is too just try to do the best you can.Limit the time out of water and revive em before letting go of them."

The last time I filleted a fish there wasn't this big open pocket of nothing in there, it's no different than our own bodies. Everything is connected and has its place, how is it possible that things can shift around?   I think, somebody, somewhere really needs to do a study on this."
348341,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-04 17:27:00,0,"a fish expends huge amounts of energy and oxygen in battling vs. an angler. at the end of this fight the fish is held in a matter in which his normally neutrally buoyant organs and hanging way down, and the fish's heart has to pump MORE blood than it normally does (because the fish has exerted itself), only now it's working against the grain to get it to reach the head/brain.  it's just physics really.  our body is the same way.  that's why they suggest that a person about to have a heart attack/stroke should not lay down...they are supposed to lean forward while sitting in a chair because it puts the least strain on the cardio/pulmonary organs and maximizing blood flow.  this alone is reason enough to hold a fish horizontal."

348416,Greencoachdog,2009-06-04 21:02:00,8163,"Ok, these are my real thoughts on the subject.  The best way to hold a large fish is with both hands!... I'm not a big fan of the one handed gill plate hold... but it's better than holding it by the eyes.  This is not a bad vertical hold:    I am supporting part of the fishes weight with my left hand around the tail.  The best hold for a large fish IMHO is neither a vertical nor horizontal hold... but on a 45 degree angle.    I've held C&R fish both vertical and horizontal and on an angle, they have all swam away none the less for wear and tear!  I think the worst thing you can do for a fish if you plan to release it, is to have poor hook removal skills... this kills more fish than anything I know of in C&R fishing.  Thanks for all the replies and I'm glad we could keep this discussion fairly civil!"

Ah well, for me smaller fish I catch generally are held vertically, and big fish are held horizontal with a hand under the fish."

348450,big guy,2009-06-04 22:06:00,414,"  Why is it that you can not make a statement or argue your point with directing shots? Your above statement is ridiculous and only shows the rest of us the size of your ego. From your pictures, it's obvious that your a fairly young compared to quite a few guys on this board including myself. It's doubtful that you have managed to catch and release as many fish as a lot these people, once again, including myself. So can you do me a favour, lighten up with the snide remarks and argue your points with validity.  Thank you  Now, having said all that, I have released maybe a thousand fish I suppose and the only trouble I've ever had with possible fish mortality was when too much time was taken getting the fish back into the water for whatever reason. The way it was held, the way it was released didn't seem to matter near as much as the time it spent out of its environment."
348457,4thgen,2009-06-04 22:12:00,157," Net? You don't do alot of shore fishing do you? Nets for the most part do more damage than good (aside from the weighty rubber models). I'm talking about shore fishing here. Some people don't have the luxury of a boat and are forced to fish from steep rocky shorelines with four foot waves breaking, piers, etc. What do you propose then? The way I see it, holding a pike horizontally requires two hands, unhooking the pike requires one. Last count, I had two hands, meaning that one is left holding the fish and the other unhooks it.   Have you ever fished from shore? Do you have any idea what that entails?? Have you ever been to the Toronto islands? I doubt it. Carrying a net while you are hiking 10km+ a day is ridiculous. Keeping them in the water while being unhooked? Try it while you're standing on a 10ft breakwall. Oh, and you're going to correct my grammar after that series of fragments you posted? Do you know what hypocrite means?  I've caught more pike than most on this board have seen and I limit the time that they are held vertically and take any pictures horizontally. I don't like to see fish mishandled but as GCD has pointed out, I would like to see some sort of data relating to the negative effects of it."
348501,holdfast,2009-06-04 23:17:00,1813," Yup and your pretty good at it too I recall.  Now Im being very nice to you, and its so Hard."
348192,Greencoachdog,2009-06-04 11:39:00,8163,"Does it really matter?  Is the vertical hold tabu just propaganda contrived by MCI/P3TA???  Is there any hard scientific data that proves  the horizontal hold is better?  Why is it ok to hold a Bass vertically, but not an Esox???  Is it really better to turn an Esox in a big ""U"" shape by trying to hold it horizontally than it is to hold it vertically and straight in it's natural form?  Does it really matter for the short time you'll actually be holding the fish for the picture? (usually less than a minute)  What do you think?"
348193,Spiel,2009-06-04 11:45:00,9065,"Well Dawg, I have no experience in musky but I do know with large salmon you can literally hear the vertebrae seperating (pop, pop) when hoisted vertically."
348197,big guy,2009-06-04 11:52:00,414,"  Separating, or just nitrogen bubbles popping? You know, the same sound you hear when the chiropractor cracks your back, or when you crack your knuckles."
348198,Greencoachdog,2009-06-04 11:52:00,8163, Maybe that's like a chiropractor adjustment and actually feels good to them? Maybe their vertebrae are just popping back into place from when you sling-shotted him into next week when he struck your trolled lure?

I usually fish alone from shore for pike and I don't see how it is possible to unhook them without holding them vertically (aside from throwing them on the ground which is likely worse). I realize that it is better for the fish to be held horizontally but I don't see how you can unhook them. So the question to those who jump on everyone for vertical holds is: How are you unhooking your fish? or are you just a bunch of hypocrits?"

348230,Raf,2009-06-04 13:09:00,3495," not sure what is the difficulty in understanding.  fish doesn't leave the water & stays in the net, is unhooked with pliers or hook cutters (if needed) or if it's a dink, doesn't even come in the net and gets unbuttoned boatside.  unhook pissed off muskie"
