First looked at the site and made a spelling error(Port Parry lol) Now i see it's Port Perry.  Anyway...well now I can't complain and saw that there is nobody that wants to clean up the area but infact there are.  Not going to register but when I go out Saturday, guess I'll bring a bag and take out a small portion with me.    MTBF  http://www.vanaqua.org/cleanup/home.php?in...p;submit=Search"
348116,bassboy,2009-06-04 02:32:00,161,"Mike,  You may want to try Port Perry instead of Port Parry......looks like there are 4 sites available for registration...  Check in here:    Shoreline cleanup registration It tells you how to register the site you wish to clean up, or suggest an alternate site not listed....  Bill"
348141,frozen-fire,2009-06-04 03:32:00,542,You're spelling it wrong... there are some sites listed as was mentioned.
348142,mikeymikey,2009-06-04 03:36:00,376,"several years ago, there used to be a large garbage can there but filled up faster than whomever could empty it. i've also seen volunteers on regular basis clearning the shore lines...  last time i've seen them was... several years ago.  maybe you should put on a vest and start?"
348180,MCTFisher9120,2009-06-04 10:54:00,3761,"lmao, oops there now I see it.  Either way, get off your buts and help clean up some garbage.  Until next time MTBF"
348270,Toronto_Angler,2009-06-04 14:42:00,698, How about leading by example instead of preaching? I've always found that more effective
