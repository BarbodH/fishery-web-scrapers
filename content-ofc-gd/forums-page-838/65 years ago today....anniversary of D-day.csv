Even of the ones that do (and Ontario is one that does), it is at the discretion of the individual teachers and schools as to how detailed they get into it.  I recall learning more about the fur trade, explorers, Jesuit Priests, and such from the 1600's than we were taught about world wars I and II.  It really is appalling!!! I don't think there is anywhere else in the world that this type of situation could exist."
