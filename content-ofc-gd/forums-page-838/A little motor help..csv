So I was thinking Prop seal leak. I pop down to the store grab the seals, and head home. pull the plug to drain the oil, and its not dark or black at all its clean?.... So I stop draining, and check the level....its full?  So my question is....what color should the oil be? And if there was water getting in would it not be mixed in, and visible? And.... Could this gooey black stuff be exhaust debris? (its a mixed gas system)"
348949,Roy,2009-06-06 18:59:00,13728,Yes it is exhaust.
348951,Sinker,2009-06-06 19:11:00,8692,"Yep, unburnt oil coming out the exaust. Run some seafoam thru it and you won't get that problem.  Sinker"
