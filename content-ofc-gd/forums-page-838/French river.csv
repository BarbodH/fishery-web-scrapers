347776,taper,2009-06-03 13:56:00,611,I can't personally verify this but was told a group of Americans were on the main channel of the French river a week ago and not having much luck. The water level is still very high and fishing has been tough. They landed  very few fish during their stay but did manage a 52 lb. musky. There are pictures of it and if I can get my hands on them I will post them. Just thought some here that frequent the area may be interested.

Our group, first timers, were pretty successful last week with ""football size bass"" a bunch of Pike and a BIG one that they missed.  They couldn't find the Walleye though.  I should mention that we, they were fishing the Upper French river near Lake Nipissing."
347943,BillM,2009-06-03 19:25:00,17367,Catching bass on the beds isn't very hard   Hopefully they realized that bass season wasn't open yet.
348009,[email protected],2009-06-03 22:23:00,6,"Oh! I'm sure catching all those bass was an accident, just like the 48"" Muskie that was brought in for a photo opp.  Todd (my husband) grabbed that fish so fast that it made everyone's head spin."
