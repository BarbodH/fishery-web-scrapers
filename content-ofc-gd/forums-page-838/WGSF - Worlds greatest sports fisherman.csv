I put it in his hands and as I go to take a picture he starts to reel the darn thing!?!?!    I put down the still camera and grab the point and shoot (with video option). Not as good as the first time, but still funny/cute. Quality is low but hey, I'm a photography guy and have never used the video feature before.      Have a great weekend folks!"
