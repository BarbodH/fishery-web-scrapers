347654,siwash,2009-06-03 03:31:00,683,I know these reels are a little dated and 'no-frills' - are their any opinions out there on them - positive or negative?  Thanks...
347664,camillj,2009-06-03 04:22:00,1988,Depending on your application .... fabulous ... I use them to troll lead line and they are indestructible ... I also use one to troll 30lb mono for big toothy critters ... and love it ... as a casting reel ... well there are probably better options ... but I am a huge fan of the  209 (and 309) and have a number that are almost as old as me .. and thats OLD !
347684,siwash,2009-06-03 09:51:00,683,thanks! what do they usually retail for? i will strictly troll with it...
347838,SlowPoke,2009-06-03 16:14:00,2984,"I love 209 & 309's. Silky smooth drag, large capacity, great clickers and bulletproof. The downside is slow retrieve rate. If you're buying new, have a look at the 209LC - linecounter. The benefit of a linecounter plus a slightly better gear ratio."
348123,Jonny,2009-06-04 02:43:00,1380,"I've got a 209. Had it since about 1977. Nice smooth reel for trolling, but yes, the gear ratio means a little extra cranking.  If I recall correctly, the main difference between older ones and newer ones is that the newer ones have a plastic spool instead of metal. I don't think that would matter much."
348189,Randy,2009-06-04 11:26:00,115,I have 2 and use them for salmon trolling.
348917,siwash,2009-06-06 14:35:00,683,"Just bought a pair of these for $40! In very good condition. They're made in the U.S. so a bit older but probably better than the ""made in china"" 209!  Both reels were spooled with flee-flicker...  I think I got a good deal..."
349013,musky_man,2009-06-06 23:17:00,159,209s and 309s are as solid as they come -- great reels.  Often find the older ones (as good as new) on E-Bay for peanuts.
349061,siwash,2009-06-07 01:55:00,683,"  Ya, but Ebay's a pain in the arse.. shipping, waiting, unexpected costs...plus yu don't know what you're buying... I saw mine on Kijiji (the best thing ever invented) got in my car and drove 15 mins, inspected what I was buying and paid $20 each for spooled and quality reels.."
