348430,Trevor0179,2009-06-04 21:15:00,65,I think a buddy of mine was telling me about a little creek somewhere around welsley that is spring fed and is home to a nice brookie population ive been thinking about going to check it out
348433,JohnF,2009-06-04 21:26:00,3494," Share! I guess that's quite possible, even probable. Nature drew some invisible fence around Stratford that won't let trout inside. They're close by on the southeast and up towards the Grand if you go Wellesley way so it's very likely. Dunno if they're in that part of the Nith. Anyone?  JF"
348556,Silo Buster,2009-06-05 01:47:00,81,"The Mennonite community is not a simple one to define.Waterloo County alone has over twenty different groups.They range from the conservative(e.g., Old order Menn) to the moderates (e.g.,Markam Menn) to the progresive groups(e.g.,General Conference Mennonites).The common ancestry springs from the early 1500s,when Menno Simons,a former Dutch priest,provided leadership to a Reform group that had left the established Catholic church.Their basic tenets of faith included a belief in adult baptism upon confession of faith and a stand of pacifism.As the faith's followers grew larger,they became known as Mennonites.   To answer the origional ?  Bass or Redfin."
348798,Musky or Specks,2009-06-05 23:30:00,2710,That invisible fence is soils. To much clay around Stratford you need gravel and sand to have trout streams or limestone. Ive found many a good trout stream by simply consulting soil maps. Yes there is a trout stream(marginal water) around Wellesley.

348847,Jonny,2009-06-06 02:31:00,1380,"No doubt gravel, sand and rock are good indicators of a speckled trout stream, but I've been on a few where those are scarce commodities, from what you can see from above the water.  The one that sticks out in my mind the most is the Dunrankin River, west of Foleyet along the CNR line. A friend and I had the ""milk run"" train drop us off there with our canoe and camping gear a number of years back. The stretch of river we fished for two full days was basically about 5 miles of slow water flowing through swampy flatlands, bordered with bulrushes cattails and lily pads. The bottom was mud. To look at the scenery would have gladdened the heart of a duck hunter but not a trout fisherman, and the specks were insane! We kept count (just for the hell of it) and caught 96, most of which, of course, were returned to the river.  Maybe the swampy environment was filtering the water as well as sand and gravel normally do?  The Shawmere River between Foleyet and Chpleau is much the same. To look at it you'd think it prime habitat for perch and hammer-handle pike, but it's a speckled trout stream, and a good one."
348875,Musky or Specks,2009-06-06 11:21:00,2710,Historically the upper Thames watershed probably did have trout mush the same way the main Grand River did. As for rivers in general its not the actual soil in the bottom and banks of the river its the surrounding soils. The upper mad and noisy rivers are prime examples of swamp brook trout streams. Also once you get into the Canadian shield the rules for BT streams change. Deep pools able to keep cool temps as well as forest cover cooling the rivers with the odd spring here and there from sand deposits on the banks. Regardless all brook trout streams must have some sort of groundwater upwelling or else the brook trout would not procreate. Fontinalus is  their name because it is their prefered boudior.

348015,Jonny,2009-06-03 22:38:00,1380," You have mixed praise and criticism here.  They raise their children to be devout, devoted to family, hard-working, and sober in thought and action. I'd say that probably qualifies them to be good citizens, even if we ourselves would not like to live that lifestyle.  EDIT - spelling"
348021,Toronto_Angler,2009-06-03 22:56:00,698,hmmm...I love how people assume that they don't have licences
348022,solopaddler,2009-06-03 22:56:00,8605," Of course I do. It's impossible to be entirely critical of anyone with those kinds of morals and values. As mentioned however it's a narrow minded existence, one which limits opportunity...and I mean opportunity in the broadest sense. Personally I see that as a pretty big negative in this day and age. Would you want your child raised in that type of environment? If yes then fire away.  I've seen a lot in my time. From the heartbreaking poverty when I lived in Manila to the desperation in the eyes of the youth in the remote native communities of our far north. Why is it that per capita the suicide rate is off the charts among youth in those remote native communities?  I believe that you can take a lot of good things from the way those people live, but nothing that extreme can be good. There's got to be a happy medium."
348031,Jonny,2009-06-03 23:20:00,1380,"Would I want my children raised that way? If I was Mennonite - yes!   Precisely because they are yearning for something they can't have. Mennonite youth, if they were to yearn for it, can. But if the communities are growing (as they are), maybe the youth are content with the lives they have been nurtured in. What price that satisfaction?  I think you assume that everyone has to have the opportunity to reach out for the modern world. If you're living close to the land, maybe that's a desire that's best left to those who havve been raised to want it. I don't see Mennonnites stunted by their lifestyle. It's not one I would choose for myself, but they seem happy enough leading a simpler life. If you're happy, and you're not encroaching on your neighbours,  what else matters?"
348050,solopaddler,2009-06-03 23:57:00,8605," Each to their own.     I know that you're exactly right. Perhaps my point wasn't clear.      No....just to have the chance to decide for themselves how and what to do with their lives. The young in those communities are so innured to the Mennonite/Amish way of living most never change.      I myself have lived literally years in the bush.....alone....living as simple a life as humanly possible. I can understand the beauty and simplicity of it. The difference between someone like myself and them I did it of my own free will.    I do.   I think you're contradicting yourself now.   Well you know what they say, ignorance is bliss.    You can't possibly deny the fact that their lifestyle choice is narrowminded."
348053,solopaddler,2009-06-04 00:12:00,8605,"And just to add and hopefully end my part in this interesting debate...  I don't really care.  I do feel sorry for the young, but live and let live.  As far as I'm concerned they can churn out as many blanket boxes and jars of apple butter as they want.  "
348059,HTHM,2009-06-04 00:29:00,4082,"By virtue of your initial statement you do agree, "" I was raised by my parents to believe that I could do anything if I put my mind to it, that the world was my oyster and to have a broad and open mind"" . This community is raising their children as they feel they should, just as I am, and just as you are. Your parents raised you as they saw fit, if they were Mennonite we would not be having this conversation."
348064,Burtess,2009-06-04 00:44:00,901,"I've got to put my $0.02 in here as well I suppose....  For you that think they live a very simple life with no electricity, treat the environment with respect, etc... , it doesn't always work that way.  They are allowed to use electricity as long as they are not plugged into the ""grid"".  They use massive diesel generators to power their industrial businesses (powder coaters, fencing manufacturers, metal finishers, etc. etc.).  This mode of electrical generation is MUCH more environmentally harmful than hooking up to the grid.  One even wanted to dump his waste cleaner solutions into his 180,000 litre manure pit and spread it on his fields.  When I explained that this was illegal, and that after he spread that on his fields and his family ate the vegetables and cattle that grazed there, that they would be ingesting the pollutants as well, he thought I was nuts.  After sending him written notification strongly suggesting he not do it, he said he would not.  Don't know where that cleaner went though......

Farms the have diaries and creameries all have to regulated by the government and inspected, they all have power. But yet they will buy a farm that already has a house on it and strip the house of all electrical and plumbing.  One of the funniest things I ever saw was at the place they manufactured their sheet metal, they build buildings, sheds, roofing steel there etc. Here is a great big building with power running to it and behind the house sat a radial arm saw with a little Honda gas motor attached to it. Made me scratch my head.  The big thing with them is that they don't want to rely on the ""outside"" world for anything, but yet they still have to buy their fuel"
348077,Jonny,2009-06-04 01:15:00,1380," Oh for all of us to be free of our parents' and society's expectations! In the microcosm of Mennonite society do you really think things are any different?   You're suggesting they're brainwashed, and if they are, so are we, just not in such a recognizable form. Those kids in the Arctic that you mentioned were sure brainwashed to want things they couldn't have.    It's no contradiction to say I wouldn't want to live that way and in that society, but yet respect (and even defend) their choice. It IS a free country, and if your whole idea is that Mennonites are coerced to stay as they are, they coerce themselves by their own expectations, and their attitudes (which their youth obviously adopt). I think you misplace your sympathy when you feel sorry for Mennonite youth. If it was such a bankrupt way of living, you'd see more of them turning away from it. They DO have that choice. No one is going to go after them with ropes and pitchforks.    Narrow-minded by whose definition?  I wonder if a Mennonite could be coerced to offer an opinion of your life?  You see, that's another thing about them, if I read them correctly... they may reject your way of life, and talk about it in their own community, but they won't openly criticize you for it."
348084,solopaddler,2009-06-04 01:30:00,8605," Yes.    Pretty much, yes.    I don't believe they have a choice for reasons already outlined. People like myself do.    Narrow minded by its literal definition. Actually I would be fascinated to hear a Mennonites opinion of my way of life, if he could be ""coerced"" of course. I'm pretty sure there'd be some interesting criticism.    (btw JP Jonny, welcome to the board!   Agree to disagree?)"
348091,Jonny,2009-06-04 01:46:00,1380,"  Well if it describes them, it might describe you too, and maybe me!   Thanks, Solo, I got more of a running start in it than I had thought I would. Lots of interesting stuff here!  Of course we can agree to disagree. Interesting debate though."

348245,JohnF,2009-06-04 13:45:00,3494,"I've been avoiding jumping into this particular fray, but hey, my name's on the durned thang.  I can argue both sides of this so forgive the contradictions to follow:  We have a lot of Mennonites in our area, obviously. When my wife finally went back to work after rearing the kids to school age we arranged for the neighbour lady to keep them after school etc until one of us was home from work. The first summer she asked if they could go to vacation bible school with her kids as she was one of the people running it. We said sure. We knew and trusted her and her family implicitly. After some weeks our kids said we were invited to the bible school final day so of course we went. We were aware that it was a country church but were a little surprised to see all the black cars, some buggies, and a predominance of long dresses (on the women) when we arrived (and no a/c in the church on a very hot muggy July evening). If you were to meet the members of that family you'd never guess they were practising Mennonites.  Some years ago a young friend of ours (actually he'd been a best friend of our eldest son and had kinda adopted us as family) started bringing his girlfriend of the moment to visit us - a very nice polite modern young lady dressed in the latest styles etc. I was so impressed with her that I arranged for her to work as a part time receptionist at our office. She graduated from high school and left our employ, presumably (by me) to go on to post secondary edykashun etc. By this time she was no longer involved with our young friend. He went through girls like I went through beer. I was quite surprised, even mildly shocked, to run into her on the street one day wearing that long dress  and apron favoured by the good Mennonite women of the Wellesley area, and the little coffee filter like hair thingy. She caught my surprise, laughed, and explained that her folks were of the older more orthodox (not sure she used that exact word) order and that through her teen years she really didn't want to live in their style. Around the time she finished high school she made a life choice to return to the fold so to speak and immediately her folks arranged a marriage for her and she became a part of that old order community. I have since run into her several times, even calling her to come in as a sub at the office on occasion, and she tells me she's happy as a clam with that simpler life. She's not a dumb little girl, far from it, and it was meaningful to me to hear her describe how much happier she is in that life style.  On the other hand in my high school and university days I worked with some of the boys from the Mennonite community, with many levels of acceptance of our modern trappings, and one constant with most of them, they could party with the best of us. There was nothing staid and somber about them when they got a snootful of lager.  The only complaint I have is that at times they present something of a traffic hazard. If it isn't tourists gawking at the anachronistic mode of transport and dress, it's one of us locals trying to figure out what new modern automotive components some enterprising Mennonite has been able to incorporate into the evolution of his ride, or just having to slow down to swing wide to get around the buggy. I'm just not that familiar with horses and the idea of the horse spooking and swinging out in front of my vehicle concerns me, despite the extra wide road shoulders provided for the buggies in certain areas.  I'm no farmer so I can't comment on their nutrient, land or manure management practices, and it's obvious to someone who has grown up seeing Mennonites all around that it's getting more and more difficult for them to maintain their old order ways as they become of necessity assimilated by our modern society. And in a way that's a shame. I often think of the aforemmentioned young lady and how content she seems with her life now. There are virtues that escape most of us in that old order lifestyle, and some criticisms that can made too. Basically it's none of my business how they or anyone else choose to live provided they stay within the law.  So, that being said, why shouldn't they be required to buy a fishing licence just like me?  Respectfully, and with abject apologies to Roy (the devil made me do it)  JF"

347899,big guy,2009-06-03 18:09:00,414,"  Wow, simply wow. Maybe you should do a little research on Mennonites.  There are hundreds in the area north of Lindsay. They get rides into town from local people, in their cars, they go to the hospital, shop in the stores in town and use gas engines on the power tools such as radial arm saws and balers. And don't we all live in ""handbuilt"" homes?  It sounds to me like you feel kind of sorry for them. If so, don't. It's the life they have chosen to live and that's great, all the power to them. Poor they are not however. When they started moving into my area, they bought some of the best farms in Victoria County and paid cash for every one of them.

347996,HTHM,2009-06-03 21:59:00,4082,"That is precisely why you have the values and morals that you have today. You were raised that way, regardless of how you may feel that the way that they raise thier kids is wrong, it is a way of raising one's children with a lot of positive attitudes towards teamwork and getting the job done together. They are passing on thier values and morals to thier children. As well, the children do have a chance to explore the outside world and see if that is the way they wish to live thier lives, (or perhaps it is the Amish), at the mid point of the teen years. One parent may find it repugnant that you took your 5 year old daughter out for a weekend fishing trip in the middle of no-where, (I find it laudable), as one should not expose ones' childern to the dangers of the wilderness. Once again  an example of different values in play. Just my two cents."
348007,solopaddler,2009-06-03 22:17:00,8605,"  Don't agree at all. I was raised by my parents to believe that I could do anything if I put my mind to it, that the world was my oyster and to have a broad and open mind. These people may be some of the nicest around but broad and open minded they're not. That their teens are given the choice of another life is commendable, but frankly too little too late. That would be akin to uprooting your own new age teen and saying ""How's about you try living like a pioneer for a while, perhaps you'd like to live your life that way?"" In most cases that 'aint gonna happen. Peoples morals ideals and personalities are already entrenched by that late age...  Yes they live a simpler life with positive attitudes.... But unless you truly believe that such a narrow minded existence is the right one in this day and age then those kids are getting the short end of lifes stick.  But then that's just one mans opinion."
348012,Jonny,2009-06-03 22:31:00,1380,"I guess I was wrong about internet use. I found a site which appears to be Amish in origin (quoted from, below). We have a tendency to lump all Amish and Mennonites roughly together, but there is a large range of belief and custom among them.   I have it on what I consider good authority that the 1985 movie ""Witness"" with Harrison Ford is a good window into Amish life for one particular sect. The female lead lived with the Amish to immerse herself in the role.  I am very skeptical of telling these people that they are not raising their children right, and I would hardly agree with a suggestion that they are similar to a cult.  I'm pretty new to this board so I don't know whether this kind of post fits, but I thought it might be helpful in light of where the discussion has gone."
347571,Jonny,2009-06-03 00:41:00,1380,"Hi John F.   I see in your profile you're in Stratford. My wife and I just got back from a three day stay in Stratford and area. Beautiful town and countryside!  When we went through Wellsley and picked up some apple butter, we saw Mennonite buggies tied up along a fence line. They were fishing a creek/river just south of the town. Any idea what they were fishing for?  I'm guessing speckles? I'm not at all familiar with the area and I'm just curious. "
347601,Woodsman,2009-06-03 01:53:00,1286,Hard to tell by your pictures but the top end of the Nith river runs through the area near Wellesley. At this time of year there is a sucker run through the river. Also some pike and panfish. Bass are also in the river and open a little later in the year.
347615,johnnyb,2009-06-03 02:23:00,3413,I think John F is the feller' yer lookin fer.....  ?
347647,Jonny,2009-06-03 03:08:00,1380,"Damn, you're right.  I tried to post earlier today and the board was not working for me, then later when I went back I typed ""John L"" instead of ""John F"".  I changed it, thanks."
347660,Cookslav,2009-06-03 04:03:00,1457,"Pike,  Thats whats in there.... Lot ""O"" bass too but out of season just yet.  I fish the Nith now and then, and have run into a few good Mennonite folk fishing old school bobbers and minnows looking for a feed of Pike."
347665,JohnF,2009-06-03 04:28:00,3494,"The others have probably nailed it. We don't see trout above Stratford, at least not that close. If you go just a bit south and east of Stratford you'll find the trout, or at least so I'm told. I've often thought I should head over Wellesley way to try some of the creeks. To be honest I'm not certain what I'd find fishwise. Generally we have carp, suckers, pike, and lots of smallmouth bass with just enuf little bitty cats to say we got 'em.  JF"
347666,JohnF,2009-06-03 04:32:00,3494,I think I recognize the spot in your pic. I'll have to check it out to see what might be in there.  JF
347730,big guy,2009-06-03 12:34:00,414,It would be interesting to know if any of them have a licence. Maybe someone familiar with the area and the situation should let the MNR know so they can pay them a visit.
347733,splashhopper,2009-06-03 12:39:00,2931,  Now why would they ahave a fishing license?  most of the ones i know don't have Social Insurance Numbers
347735,big guy,2009-06-03 12:42:00,414,  exactly  Does anyone know a CO local to that area?
347740,Jonny,2009-06-03 12:50:00,1380,"Thanks, gents! Curiosity satisfied.   We came out of Baden (Castle Kilbride) heading west, turned north at a high school, stayed on that highway toward Wellesley. Just as you come around a corner and you can see Wellesley just up ahead (some kind of lumber yard or the like sticks out in my mind), you cross this creek/river. The Mennonites were fishing just on either side of the bridge.  ---  EDIT - as far as siccing a CO on them, I don't know about that. Seems a little extreme considering the way they live. I'm thinking thre's probably a balance struck there already? You guys familiar with the area would know better, of course."
347743,JohnF,2009-06-03 12:53:00,3494, I know the area. I'll check it out. Mebbe those boys have a honey hole in there.  JF
347744,jediangler,2009-06-03 12:54:00,1923,"I've fished that bridge and many others over the Nith river. I believe they are fishing for pike. There are bass and carp as well as some perch. A buddy of mine once caught a 33"" pike from under that very bridge. I was fishing the Conestoga river in Macton once when a C.O. came by and started checking everyone for their license. There were about a dozen people fishing for pike on both sides of the river. After checking eight people they left without checking the mennonite family of 4 fishing right beside me."
347750,Jonny,2009-06-03 12:57:00,1380," I guess they've established a ""modus operandi"" well in the past."
347780,Rattletrap2,2009-06-03 14:10:00,1652,"Having a CO hassle these people is the last thing I would want to see! They live a simple life and should not be bothered.  NOW, as for the one ""redneck"" buggy there with the automobile seats on a huge platform.....that there is a feat of engineering! LOL These folks would definitely be leaning towards ""new order""! (Kinda bordering on ""trailer trash""!!"
347784,Raf,2009-06-03 14:15:00,3495,you're not kiddn rattletrap.  that's one pimpn moe-beele.  i'd be rolling in one of those fo sho'
347799,cambo,2009-06-03 14:32:00,62," Most Mennonite's in my area fish during open seasons and they are mostly kids that I see,I wouldn't be to concerned about it. Probably canning suckers anyway."
347812,big guy,2009-06-03 15:13:00,414,"Laws are laws boys, whether a certain group of people want to recognize them or not. Everyone of the appropriate age should have to buy a licence and abide by the catch and possession limits, I don't give care who you are, or how you live your life.  If indeed they are catching pike, I wonder how many limits they have at home canned or otherwise."
347815,Governator,2009-06-03 15:27:00,879,The picture in the bottom left... nice convertable mini van.
347819,Harrison,2009-06-03 15:36:00,2202,I hope they don't run across the pictures of their hotspots as they surf the net.
347841,leighfns,2009-06-03 16:20:00,103, I guarantee they have far less impact on the environment than 99.9% of the people on this board.  If anything they should be coming after us for all the useless waste and pollution that we generate which has far more effect on fish populations.  Just let these people be...
347845,big guy,2009-06-03 16:40:00,414,  horse crap  laws are laws and we are/should all be equal under them
347855,Governator,2009-06-03 17:09:00,879,"  I totally agree, they are lighter on the environment than anyone.  Let them do their thing."
347866,Jonny,2009-06-03 17:28:00,1380,  :D  I don't think that's in their repertoire!
347869,maybo,2009-06-03 17:34:00,86,nice spot
