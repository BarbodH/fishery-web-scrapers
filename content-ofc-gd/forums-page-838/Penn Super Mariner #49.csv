348710,Jonny,2009-06-05 17:57:00,1380,"I have a big Penn Super Mariner #49 loaded with about 3-400 ft of steel line. It has caught some very nice lakers in its day, from way down deep.  I haven't wire-lined for lake trout in years, I almost exclusively fish Lake Nipissing now. So my question is, do you think there's any other use for it (with or without the steel line)?  Keep in mind it's not a level-wind. You have to guide the line back and forth up onto the spool with your thumb, no big deal for lakers once you get used to it, but I wonder if anyone has used this kind of reel differently than I have?"
