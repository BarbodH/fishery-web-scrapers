348099,Spiel,2009-06-04 02:12:00,9065,"  Okay I got ask, how so?"
348146,HTHM,2009-06-04 03:56:00,4082,"Because those are MY boats....  And I am looking to upgrade, tee hee"
348417,aplumma,2009-06-04 21:03:00,6896,  If I show this to pops and he got to keep the accessories  I bet he would road trip with me... Don't tempt us.    Art
348431,Spiel,2009-06-04 21:17:00,9065,Damn I'd say anything just bout anything to get here.
347532,Spiel,2009-06-02 22:55:00,9065,"Okay here's the deal, I have a 4 stroke 75 horse Merc and according to the Merc web site it is identical (near as I can tell) to the 90 horse in every detail. So the question is how do I, or can I tap into the extra 15 horse?  75 EFI FourStroke Specifications  90 EFI FourStroke Specifications"
347536,Terry,2009-06-02 22:59:00,14456,might be a different carb and manifold    multi-port  Injection...so maybe not....LOL
347538,Spiel,2009-06-02 23:03:00,9065,It's electronic fuel injected (EFI) Terry. I'm thinking it's a computer module type thing.
347539,Spiel,2009-06-02 23:03:00,9065,You edit to fast.
347541,ptmpete,2009-06-02 23:09:00,49,Could be Cams and timing or Comp module
347542,Terry,2009-06-02 23:19:00,14456,"yup, I was thinking old school  you can buy different chips for trucks that can change the hp , so why not"
347543,Bondar,2009-06-02 23:22:00,817,http://continuouswave.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/014043.html  heres a link i found if you feel like doing some reading
347548,Tybo,2009-06-02 23:45:00,1373,"Different cams,injectors,intake manifold,exhaust manifold,timing,spark plugs,cylinder heads and ECM."
347551,Spiel,2009-06-02 23:51:00,9065,"  Thanks for that Wiser, it explains in terms beyond layman (my level of understanding) what I pretty much suspected. I'm stuck with a 75 horse outboard."
347552,Spiel,2009-06-02 23:53:00,9065,"  Remind me not to let you near it Paul, especially if we've had a few."
347555,Tybo,2009-06-03 00:04:00,1373,"You could always look into a power head exchange. After the core charge, It could be reasonable. Done through the factory,you would still have warranty."
347566,danbouck,2009-06-03 00:16:00,4380,Irish told me last year that it is the computer and it costs about $1500 to replace. My 50HP is the same as the 40 and 60
347567,Tybo,2009-06-03 00:18:00,1373,"Chris, After a few. It would be, Hold my beer, I'm strapping on the Turbo'ed,Super charger."
347575,kickingfrog,2009-06-03 00:48:00,8333,  I'd love to watch that.... as long as it's not mine.
347711,John,2009-06-03 11:51:00,2956," Hmmmm, note to self, buy lock for motor before Lakair.........."
347978,Tybo,2009-06-03 20:48:00,1373,"John. Locks are . So you don't tempt a honest man.  There alway some inexpensive way of getting a few more hp's A port and polish. shaving the heads.cold plugs.recarbing.prop. and a tweak to the ecm.(Timing) You will be close to  80hp, But run a higher rpm. With running the higher rpm's you be close to running the same as a 90 stocker.  Jack plate and a surface drive. That would go good on a TILLER!!"
347997,JohnF,2009-06-03 22:01:00,3494, Wouldn't the headers scare the fish?  JF
348000,JohnF,2009-06-03 22:02:00,3494, Change the motor shroud. Who'll know?  JF
348001,HTHM,2009-06-03 22:03:00,4082,"Or, just be content with what you have...."
348002,JohnF,2009-06-03 22:06:00,3494, Ya mean like you are with the boats you've got now?  JF
348037,aplumma,2009-06-03 23:37:00,6896,If I was u I would sell the whole thing to Art and start out fresh with a 90HP. Don't forget my favorite boat accessory.................. brook though.     Art
348046,Spiel,2009-06-03 23:55:00,9065," LOL, it was the dealer that told me the cowlings were interchangable which led me to discover the motors were pretty much identical. What irks me is I would have bought a 90, no question. But here's the rub, my boat with a side console and steering wheel is rated for the 90, tiller model (which I have) is rated 75 max, on the same damn hull.     The dealer would have installed the 90 if I requested it but you know what that would do the boat warranty and the issue of obtaining insurance."
348048,Spiel,2009-06-03 23:57:00,9065, Will you come and get it
348054,JohnF,2009-06-04 00:14:00,3494," Perhaps you should just learn patience, my son.  JF"
348055,HTHM,2009-06-04 00:16:00,4082,"No, no, that's different"
