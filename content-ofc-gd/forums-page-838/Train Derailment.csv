A ten block area has been evacuated around the area. A couple of cars ended up in peoples backyards. This city is taking an ass kicking this year, I hope everything works out for those affected."

From what I know, on of the cars on the train contained a house hold chemical...hopefully it has not been ruptured in any way."
