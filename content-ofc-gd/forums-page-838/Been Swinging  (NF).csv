346731,Greencoachdog,2009-06-01 02:15:00,8163,Golf was invented for people that aren't very good at fishing!

346743,Greencoachdog,2009-06-01 02:50:00,8163,"  I dunno about all of that... but she did give me $50 and told me to fill the boat up with gas and to keep the change for ""minnow money""  ... do you think she's tryin' to get rid of me?... or does it not get any better than that???"

347391,solopaddler,2009-06-02 15:55:00,8605, I've gotta admit when I saw the title of the post I was thinking along the same lines.
347397,JohnF,2009-06-02 16:20:00,3494,Golf is a great game. My son the golf pro tells me it's even more fun when you learn to do it right.  JF
347456,glen,2009-06-02 20:09:00,2641,I gave up golf.  It was cutting into my fishing time.
347469,Roy,2009-06-02 20:48:00,13728,I'm still too young and active to golf.
347477,misfish,2009-06-02 21:13:00,29133," Ah yer to modest Roy.  Nothing wrong with swinging a club now and then and slinging a gun or bow now and then.  Fishing well,I like reading Dawgs reports."
347491,limeyangler,2009-06-02 21:50:00,5204,Welcome back.....but golf?! oh well each to their own. Its like that fishig show skins  and fins....i just dont get it how ...or why would you want to stop fishing to go swing a club?  especially in some of the locations they get to fish in.....
348513,Tarzan's Jane,2009-06-04 23:35:00,1183,"Just a quick response to all you lazy men who prefer to sit on your tush...golf is a great work out.  And no I haven't given up the fishing just trying out new stuff.  Hunting...well I need to target shoot first...not sure that I can kill wabbits nor bambi, heck probably not even gentle ben....  Roy....you wouldn't be able to last a full 18 holes!!  I won't even double dog dare ya on that either....I saw pics of you from your days at Lakair...pretty sad indeed.  hahaha"
