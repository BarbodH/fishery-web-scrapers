Should I have a battery for the trolling motor on its own ? or can I run the fish finder and light off the same one ?  Also, what guage wire should I use for the trolling motor ?  thanks !"

I would have a battery dedicated to the motor.  I haven't had any problems running a 42 lb thrust motor with 8 gauge wiring.  I wouldn't go lighter than that, six gauge would be better."
348766,gone_fishin,2009-06-05 21:42:00,481,usually the manual will give you a recommended gauge wire to use... mine recommended 6 gauge. and definitely get a separate battery for your motor.
348785,ohhenrygsr,2009-06-05 22:37:00,947,Rule of thumb is to run a dedicated Trolling Motor Battery and it has to be Deep Cycle.  Then have your starting battery run your electronics and outboard.  That way your not having any interference with your fish units
