Any other suggestions out there ."

Tighten the adjuster needles in and back out to the same spot (count the turns). Check screen or filter from tank to carb for blockage.  I don't have an outboard but those are the first things I'd check on my lawnmower or blower. Fuel shortage is usually pretty easy to isolate.  But wait for Cliff. He's the small engine guy here.  JF

Run some Sea Foam to your fuel and go run it. If this doesn't solve the issue a carb rebuild may be in order. It could also be a fuel pump problem, but I would check the carb first."
