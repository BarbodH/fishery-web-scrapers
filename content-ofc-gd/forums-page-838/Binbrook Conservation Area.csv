I am looking to fish for Crappie. Can anyone tell me of any particular spots on the lake that are hotspots for Crappie and also what tackle (live, lures, etc. - no preference) would be ideal  to catch Crappie. I have been there a couple times at the Tyneside entrance fishing down the trails but have had no luck, I assume because of the fact I am new to fishing I am not going to the right spots or using the right stuff. Any sort of help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks everyone.  Anglers2Be..."

Good luck and post a report of your actches.... there will be catches.  take some pics if you can."

It was non-stop for a couple of hours with white jig heads and white twister tails. Sold the boat but I am looking at maybe getting an economical inflatible with a cheap electric to fish areas like Binbrook and Mountsberg that have really good fishing if you can get on the water."
