330890,Pigeontroller,2009-04-16 21:12:00,2793,Looks good to me.
330901,lew,2009-04-16 21:27:00,12766,"Thats an excellent looking bait and certainly doesn't look like the 1st time you've tied one. Black with silver is also a good colour combo too.  You asked for feedback so I'd like to just offer a tip if I may.  With musky size hooks being so large and to reduce doing any further harm to the fish, many of us simply cut the hooks off, rather than trying to pull them back out again.  It only takes a few seconds to replace the trebles and were back in business, but with your skirt tied directly to the hook it would basically ruin the whole set-up if one or more trebles had to be cut off.  Best bet is to tie on a skirt directly to the shaft, but have a split ring inside where a treble could be added, then when it's cut off there's no damage to the skirt section and your good to go again.  Just my thoughts though and again congrats on a fine looking bait."
330927,Dnthmn,2009-04-16 21:53:00,128,Thanks for the tip lew. I'll give that a try on the next few I make.
330969,Weeds,2009-04-16 23:50:00,782,"I'm kind of thinking along the same lines as Lew.... sort of; I'd suggest going one step further and going with barbless trebles. I'm not even sure if any of the big musky lure makers do it (meaning Suick, Drifter Tackle, Musky Innovations, Mepps,etc) but you could really corner yourself a piece of the market. I've already pinched down a few barbs this off season but I'd be happy to purchase barbless in the future providing it was available and cost competitive.  What you've got there looks good too though! I can't wait for Musky opener!"
331033,Dnthmn,2009-04-17 01:30:00,128,barbless...things that make you go hmmmm.  I'll have to try and find a supplier for 5/0 barbless trebles!  Thanks weeds.
331036,tinbanger,2009-04-17 01:35:00,1028,"Barbless ? hadn't thought of that , wonder if due to size of the hooks and fish yopu may lose more fish ?  With my only muskie ,, cut the hook of without a second thought  TB"
331045,irishfield,2009-04-17 01:48:00,26272,25 cents every 5 years isn't a big deal is it Dave.. lol  Nice work there dtheman
331048,tinbanger,2009-04-17 01:50:00,1028,"hey , be nice   every THREE years  TB"
331088,Ron,2009-04-17 03:53:00,1683,"  Hope we can change that for ya Dave.  As for the spinner, looks great! As mentioned though, would be a bonus if it could be rigged up some how with the treble being removable."
