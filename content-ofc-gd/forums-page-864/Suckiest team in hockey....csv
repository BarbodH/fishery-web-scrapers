331053,jediangler,2009-04-17 02:04:00,1923,What's with the Habs new tendency of gooning guys while they celebrate a goal. Kind of Hunter like. What about Komisarek doing some eye gouging after the final whistle. Has all the class gone out of this once storied franchise?

331098,Sebastian,2009-04-17 04:14:00,208, You can really spot the Americans in an Ontario Fishing Forum. Hockey is a Canadian sport. Keep watching Americans do 400 laps in a circle in GM cars. Definately much more entertaining and physically active.

331112,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-17 05:45:00,0,"it's not our fault that hockey is just plain too rad for anyone too far below the 45th. they tried to dumb it down on fox with the lazer puck and yanks were still too stupid to get a sport that didn't involve tailgating, scantily clad women, or driving around in circles.  hell, they even stole the name ""football"" from another sport because they couldn't think of their own name! hockey is rad and the playoffs is 2 months of heaven (and my team ain't even it it this year)"
