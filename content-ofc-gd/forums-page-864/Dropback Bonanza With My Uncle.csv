330585,solopaddler,2009-04-16 01:22:00,8605,"Amazingly I managed to convince my supposedly retired (but busier than ever) uncle to join me on the river  today. There's not much substance to this particular report. After almost 60 hours with no sleep and up and at 'em again tomorrow I just don't have it in me.  However I will say it was a ridiculous day, the fish were numerous, ravenously hungry and seemingly suicidal. (Those are the types of conditions my uncle prefers.  )  The fish were almost entirely raggedy beat up dropback fish. Most had battle scars and all were full of spunk and energy....  I'll let the pic's and video clip tell the story.....                                       Short video clip here. My uncle's got this soft old Browning ""Dick Swan"" noodle rod. He missed a bunch of fish today because of it and you can hear him complaining about it. It's kinda funny. His excitement is obvious though.     Cheers,  Mike"

330684,solopaddler,2009-04-16 08:05:00,8605," My uncles got chronic back pain, it's especially debillitating when he walks around. (That's why he only fishes with me maybe twice a year).  Anyhow he built that thing on Tues night. It's basically a shaft of wood with a small hinged seat that locks into place. He sat/leaned on it all day as well as used it as a wading staff.  (pretty cool I thought)"
