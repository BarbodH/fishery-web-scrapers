Those steps are usually level with the dock in the summer months. A few pics of the marina. Was nice to just sit and soak in some rays,long time coming.      After about a half hour of that we started walking again and low and behold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Number one son is catching a feed for thier dinner.        Then  this little angel appears.    So after a quick visit, we are off to finish our walk.  OH, OH, I know this aint no 4lt jug.LOL  "
