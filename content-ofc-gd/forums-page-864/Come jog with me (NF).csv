329717,Joey,2009-04-13 23:36:00,9122,"I've been jogging recently, on a really nice path not far from my home.  It takes me about 40 - 45 minutes to run and it has a weaving river that runs through it.  Here is the path, which they have been doing recent work on, hence the tire tracks.    This is the river.  This is the average width, but it does get wider in spots, to about 10 feet across.  There are tons of crayfish and smaller fish, not sure what they are though, in it.    Visability is good right now    Then I jogged past something that looked like a human scull.  Thought I might have to call CSI in, but upon further inspection it appeared to be harmless.  Can you figure out what it is?    The path is beautiful in the summer.  I'll take some pics when it gets all nice and green.  Joey"

330400,fishnsled,2009-04-15 18:20:00,3520,Well I soon discovered how out of shape I am.  Let's just go for a walk next time.
330445,huey graphite,2009-04-15 20:56:00,362,"  I used to jog but the ice kept spilling out of my drink    Perhaps Ray, Ricky, Bubbles, and Julian were driving by and threw there pi$$ jugs out the window."
330493,Ron,2009-04-15 22:56:00,1683,    Now I'm all flustered!  Forgot to mention I thought it was one of those Halloween Skeletons.
330804,Carp,2009-04-16 16:59:00,1488,"Ummmm. Looks like a skull.  Yeah, first thought was a plastic bag caught round some brush, but the hole gives it away as a plastic jug. I used to run a lot, but she kept calling the police and they would always bring me home."
