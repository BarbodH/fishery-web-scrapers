Not a sniff for the first hour or so until the water warmed a little. Float fishing was a waste and settled on bottom rigs. With this NE wind everything seems to be hugging the bottom. 10 minutes after switching rigs I get that first  tap,tap,tap, followed by 2 hours of steady action. There were perch, gills and rockies. There was also a few of:     This fellow lost a fight with something (another rocky)   Back home by 1 to meet my daughter from school and whip up a pot of scratch pea soup for tonight's supper."
330407,spyder3g,2009-04-15 19:01:00,50,Nice silver bass. Can we take them in this period or they are closed as pigs (small & large M basses)?
330416,bigugli,2009-04-15 19:37:00,6138,Silver/white bass and white perch are classed as panfish and open. They come from a different family of fish 'Morone'. Whereas what we normally call bass  are sunfish in the 'Centrarchidae' family.
330419,steelheader42,2009-04-15 19:41:00,44,Isnt that a white perch? l tought siver bass has stripes on them...Has far has l know down here in zone 16 they are  open all year...
330509,bigugli,2009-04-15 23:33:00,6138, Quite right. Also in the family 'Morone'
330512,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-15 23:35:00,3761,"Great report dude, but what was that silver looking fish? Some kind of Crappie?  Thanks for sharing!"
330540,BassAsin,2009-04-16 00:26:00,806,"read the previous posts mike    great report bruce, thats quite  a mix bag of fish. is the tail on the cat in the 3rd flat with the back? or just the way it appears in the picture?  Matt!"
330618,bigugli,2009-04-16 02:07:00,6138,Once a bullhead sticks the fins out you cannot lay the head on it's side. It's just a deceptive appearance thingy.
330640,Greencoachdog,2009-04-16 02:43:00,8163,"Nice Morone americana in the first pic, looks real healthy!!!  The Crappie would've been a throw back here, 9"" limit on most lakes and 10"" min on others.  Those Bullheads fry up real nice if you've never tried them!!!"
330644,tibbs,2009-04-16 02:45:00,650,Nice Job!  Must be nice to get out.
330645,BassAsin,2009-04-16 02:46:00,806,ok i wasnt sure i have never taken a picture of any of my cats before normally toss a few in a pail and the rest in the lake thought maybe it was a deformity like a 2 tailed bass or something! i say that cuz i caught one this past summer
330660,bigugli,2009-04-16 03:05:00,6138," That crappie was just over 9"". I've got big paws   Anything less than the spread of my hands goes back. (except smelts)  Actually, I love eating coldwater cats this time of year. I just kept  enough pannies (3) to give the puppies and I a decent brekkie tomorrow."
330706,bigugli,2009-04-16 12:15:00,6138,"And what is a panfish report without the ""after"" photos?    and one each for the pups "
330770,spyder3g,2009-04-16 15:10:00,50,"Really nice report and great photos! Thx About those silver basses (sometimes people call them blue basses). Last May - June on Grand (Caledonia) I got many of them. One was a big one (for that kind of fish) 550 – 600g. However, they almost did not bite in July – September."
330792,bigugli,2009-04-16 16:35:00,6138,"The silver/white bass only come up the river to spawn. By July they are back in L Erie. They are a schooling fish and if you suddenly see a big commotion on the surface, that will be a school chasing a bait ball to the surface. You can have a real blast casting into the middle of that."
330834,spyder3g,2009-04-16 18:43:00,50,Thanks for info about white bass. I didn't know about that.
