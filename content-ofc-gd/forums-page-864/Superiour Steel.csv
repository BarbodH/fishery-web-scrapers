331092,pike slayer,2009-04-17 04:04:00,1177,"i was thinking about dragging out the 12' tinner and trolling the mouths of the pancake, carp, chip, etc. im sure i'll hook into a few out there!"
329665,pikeie,2009-04-13 22:05:00,380,"Well I have been looking at the steelhead reports from all you guys down south for some time now, wishing I could get out. Problem is Superior is still frozen solid and the water temps to cold.  On the weekend a few of my friends and I decided to go for a drive up the superior shoreline and hit a few rivers. We werenâ€™t expecting too much as the first river we got to still had people ice fishing at the mouth!!  But we started drifting anyways, 10 minutes in I had I pick up on a size 12 gold ribbed hares ear, I got the fish on and when it got to shore I realized  it was just a whitefish about 2 lbs, then the hook pulled out lmao... that was it on this river. Got some nice pictures though.   So we keep driving and decide to hit the famous Chippewa River lol. It sure is some beautiful water to fish.       After being there for a while and no fish being hooked by any of the four of us, my friend Wes gets a hit and finally fish on. After a short fight he gets his fish on the bank and unhooked.... I ask him what he got it on and he said wax worms! I have never heard of this but I figure the fish just wanted to see something different.   So finally the steelies are starting their spring run, and it can only get better from here on, they better be quick though.... I've only got 17 days till I'm done school and on my way back down south.   Pikeie"
329675,tinbanger,2009-04-13 22:36:00,1028,nic pics matt  you were at those falls about 17 years ago on a trip up to Nipegon for moose hunting !  Look forward to seeing you in 15 days !  TB (Dad)
329685,Joeytier,2009-04-13 22:51:00,3990,Good stuff.  You're lucky to be fishing those rivers.  I've only seen them in the summer.  I'd sure love to be up there this time of year.
329695,aniceguy,2009-04-13 23:07:00,1094,sweet pics spent time sitting on that very same rock...Im actually contemplating coming up that way in a few to pay a visit to the harmony for those small little tasty critters
329697,pike slayer,2009-04-13 23:11:00,1177,"nice pics matt! i was planning on going out to the carp for ice fishing at the mouth early morning then hit up the carp later in the morning, my buddys were they today and they said they cleaned up!"
329727,Joeytier,2009-04-13 23:42:00,3990,"Could one of you soo boys do me a favour and give me an update on the rivers this coming Friday?  If they look good, I'll be coming up next weekend."
329738,pike slayer,2009-04-13 23:50:00,1177,"i'll be out tomorrow and give you a report for then, as long as the weather is decent it should be awesome bow fishing on the tribs and locks!"
329745,Joeytier,2009-04-13 23:56:00,3990,Keep me posted!
329762,pikeie,2009-04-14 00:29:00,380,"hey keep me posted too! lol i might be out tomarrow, trying to figure out where. might end up goin out for specks in the west end. but wouldnt mind a nice steelie!! and is the carp river open yet? buddy of mine said it was still solid in most places  pikeie"
329768,solopaddler,2009-04-14 00:36:00,8605,"Just beautiful, thanks for posting."
329809,pike slayer,2009-04-14 01:39:00,1177,"we are heading out at 6am and for the first part of the morning we will be ice fishing at the mouth of the carp, i've been told theres 5inches left and its suppose to rain later this week and all the ice will probably be gone by the weekend or early next week. then later in the morning we will be heading to the chip and putting on our waders and try some river fishing. i'll post how it goes! maybe even get some pics!"
329813,Raf,2009-04-14 01:42:00,3495,nice shots pikeie!
330021,pike slayer,2009-04-14 18:23:00,1177,"me and a few buddies went out at 6am this morning and ice fished the mouth of the carp from 7-10 and missed 3 whitefish and that was it. theres about 5inches of ice and it will probably be gone by the end of the week, the ice is out from the shorelines and doesnt look to safe. We tried the pancake river for a bit and it was a mud river and didnt look to promising. then we went to the chip and there was a few ppl out fishing and we tried a number of different things, spoons, spinners, bottom bouncing spawn and float fishnig spawn, we didnt get anything and either did anyone else there. the river is muddy and gross. i hope within the next week it picks up!"
330086,pikeie,2009-04-14 21:57:00,380,"ya my friends said the same, they were there this morning from 7-10:30 with out a hit. the water was really brown they said. were going agian on thursday afternoon, and agian on the weekend."
330094,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-14 22:12:00,0,I've just been sticking downtown. Have actually been getting fish in the tailrace without even venturing into the rapids.  My buds have taken several fish in the last two evenings late on spinning gear even.
330176,tjsa,2009-04-15 01:16:00,1578," Pikeie, go a bit further north in the next week. I used to go for steelies in that area in the middle of April. The Harmony, Batchewana, Pancake, Coldwater, Sand, all the way up to the Old Woman(my favorite in that area) should be good to go within a week."
330194,Mike the Pike,2009-04-15 01:38:00,3421,Well good luck to ya on your next outing thanks for the pics Matt.  I think your Dad should lend you the boat once in a while
330312,troutologist,2009-04-15 12:52:00,951,  We need a good rain until most of those rivers are fishable. Lots of ice on them still. If the weather man is right about this weekend mid to late next week should be doable.
330335,Dara,2009-04-15 13:59:00,3052,Nothing but sunshine in the forecast except for a slight chance of rain Saturday and Tuesday next week. Still early yet. Wer'e having a late thaw this year. One good thing is the Goulais ice is out so we don't have to be concerned with flooding this year. I gotta get to the rapids...you guys are giving me the bug
330525,pike slayer,2009-04-15 23:51:00,1177,"the pancake is one chocolate looking river right now, i seen 2 guys out in a tinny at the mouth of it fishing though, im not sure if they were getting any or what. i think the rivers will be in there prime either this weekend or early next week. i was out past ranger today on mini spike and there was about 2 feet of snow in the bush and only 1 foot of ice, i think if we get that rain this weekend by the middle of the week most of the ice on the inland lakes will be gone or definitly not save to go on if you can even get on the ice cause the shorelines are all melted and theres 5feet of open water. so if you wanna get out ice fishing one last night this weekend is the time to do it then start getting the boat ready."
330673,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-16 04:07:00,0,soooooon.  melting ice on the inland headwaters with a bit of rain and we are in full swing. has anybody been out east of town?
330803,pikeie,2009-04-16 16:56:00,380,a few of my friends went to check out little rapids the other day but no fish were seen...
330990,Joeytier,2009-04-17 00:34:00,3990,How are the rivers looking up there?
330995,pike slayer,2009-04-17 00:42:00,1177,rivers of chocolate!!
331087,pikeie,2009-04-17 03:50:00,380,"ya their a mess right now. but they should be clearing, unless we get the rain their calling for this weekend. but theres always the st. marys river rapids, the rapids are always clear...."
