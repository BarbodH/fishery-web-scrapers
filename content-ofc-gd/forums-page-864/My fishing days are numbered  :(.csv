330265,Ron,2009-04-15 04:57:00,1683,"My fishing days are numbered, or so my daughter thinks. A bit of background here.....  My daughter has been riding horses going on 12 yrs now, we bought our first horse just over 2 yrs ago. The horses name is ""Pork Chop"", it has good blood lines and just didn't cut it for being a Quarter horse racer. Steph has been working on her for Barrel racing for only 6 months now and on the weekend was her first competition. She was successful at teh races winning both heats with the fastest overall time in her class. She also won the ""Dash for Cash"" as well. There were about 40 horses entered in the various classes and Steph had the second fastest time overall at just .055 of a second slower. She definitely turned some heads as people were asking who this ""kid"" was and where does she train?  So now her next competition will be near Hamilton where if she does well she could come home with some serious coin. This will be held on opener of the walleye season in the Kawarthas. A small price to pay to see my daughter live her dream.  Enjoy the pics...            Cheers, Ron..."

330278,Big Cliff,2009-04-15 09:29:00,6899,"Fantastic pictures! I especially like that second one, both Pork Chop and your daughter look like they are comfortable and confident and giving it their all! All the best to both of them in the up coming event and you are right, it is a very small price to pay!"
330289,Bob,2009-04-15 10:53:00,370,Beautiful!  I rode pleasure-class competition MANY years ago and found the hardest part of the whole thing was learning to put a lot of faith into one of the most neurotic creatures that walks the face of this earth.  What a lot of fun!  Yeehaaawwww!!!
330307,danc,2009-04-15 12:39:00,4677,That's awesome Ron. Thanks for sharing..
330347,Carp,2009-04-15 14:44:00,1488,Forget the walleye opener. You can fish walleye anytime of year. Your daughter's competitions are more important.
330349,e-z-out,2009-04-15 14:47:00,1052,  Family first fishing right after  Remo you not working today?
330354,fishnsled,2009-04-15 15:02:00,3520,"That's just awesome Ron!  Congrats to Steph and good luck in the next competition.  Love the 2nd and last pics.  They seem to show the power and speed of Pork Chop, great looking horse."
330384,irishfield,2009-04-15 16:45:00,26272,And people think boats are expensive to maintain!  Great stuff Ron.. she's a keeper for sure !  She just better not have an event.. say around the 3rd week of February....
330399,osmondrs,2009-04-15 18:11:00,61,"Congrats & best wishes to you & your daughter   .  If I were you, I wouldn't worry about fishing on such a day.  One day of horsing around is not likely to affect your fishing around career...  Os"
330402,bigugli,2009-04-15 18:37:00,6138,"Nothing more satisfying, as a parent, than to see your child pick up a hobby/sport, thoroughly enjoy it, then excel at it. Who cares about the fishing when your child is getting that chance to live the dream. You must be proud as a peacock."
330404,Tom McCutcheon,2009-04-15 18:48:00,627,That explains why he was STRUTTING around last night at the MCI meeting.  HIS FEATHERS WERE OUT....  Congrats Ron.
330406,bigugli,2009-04-15 18:52:00,6138,Good un
330410,Michael_Brown,2009-04-15 19:17:00,411,"The horse's name is Pork Chop?  .... I wonder who he is named after. Congrats to your daughter, Ron. Don't worry about fishing, you never catch anything anyway. See you tomorrow night in Coboconk."
330413,pigeonfisher,2009-04-15 19:28:00,696,My Father runs the Holstein Rodeo...A few years ago was the first time I saw that event.  WOW...very impressive for your daughter.
330418,Joey,2009-04-15 19:40:00,9122,That's great Ron     I used to ride myself and did a few jumping and trail competitions in and around the Elliot Lake area.  Had a blast and I will remember it fondly forever.  Good luck to Steph  Joey
330896,Pigeontroller,2009-04-16 21:22:00,2793,Amazing pics!  I do think she needs a better helmet though Ron!
331095,Ron,2009-04-17 04:08:00,1683,"  A 50.00 helmet for a 50.00 head is what I always said. (Just a FYI, that is one of the best helmets on the market and yes slightly more than 50.00! ha ha ha)  Thanks for all the encouragements guys. So, anyone want to buy a Lund?"
331096,Ron,2009-04-17 04:09:00,1683," Talk to the hand Mike.... Hey, I listened to your opinion, now you can listen to mine.... ha ha ha"
