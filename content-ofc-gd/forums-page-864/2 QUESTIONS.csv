330438,kemper,2009-04-15 20:30:00,2232,1) Same day as trout opener  2) I have heard it is as low as 68 and as high as 75. Low 70s on the kawarthas usually does well for me
330440,SylvanOwner,2009-04-15 20:36:00,266,I'm thinking it might even be different for LMB vs. SMB?  and water body dependant?

330737,Stoty,2009-04-16 13:49:00,2910, SM prefer cooler water temps. Most of them hang out in the deeper water near offshore structure during the heat of the summer.
