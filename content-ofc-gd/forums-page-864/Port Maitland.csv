329990,LeXXington,2009-04-14 16:19:00,1928,Hi All:  Does anyone know  if the docks are in at Port maitland yet  Thinking of heading down later this week. For some kitty action.  Thanks
330004,bdox,2009-04-14 16:54:00,329,"Are you going by yourself? We launch at Maitland in November to fish Erie smallies. No dock required. 2 person job though. One to back the boat in and one to back the boat off. And just hover around until the driver is ready to hop aboard. If you're going by yourself though, you might want to launch in Dunnville or at Fishmasters (both pay launches)."

330011,LeXXington,2009-04-14 17:57:00,1928,Its the first boat launch of the year  need the dock to make sure all is AOK.  Too early in the year to be saved by the coast guard
330130,Radnine,2009-04-14 23:32:00,1538,Hey Lexx What about calling them at Fatts Bait and Tackle (905-774-4577)? Jim
330369,LeXXington,2009-04-15 15:51:00,1928,"Thanks, Jim that was my next question for the name of the bait shop  If all else failes I have to drive on the otherside of the river to Fishmasters."
330394,brifishrgy,2009-04-15 17:37:00,559,  there is a new trailer park (couple years ago) across from the airport that has a launch .. not sure if its any good or not but might be worth a try before you drive all the way back
330688,pikehunter,2009-04-16 10:02:00,1659," Expensive! And the owner is a well, you know.... used it once about 2 or 3 years ago and they charged 10 bucks and did nothing but carp about the free launch at Pt. Maitland and the BBQ launch price.  It's all gravel BTW and the dock is too high from the water. Use BBQ or Fishmaster."
330810,brifishrgy,2009-04-16 17:06:00,559,  thanks .. now I know not to bother goin there
330849,Radnine,2009-04-16 19:37:00,1538,Talked to the lady at the bait shop and she said that the dock is not in yet and usually goes in around the end of April. Jim
