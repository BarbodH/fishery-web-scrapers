329767,nautifish,2009-04-14 00:33:00,1416,Well after working all over the easter weekend at LPB.  Yesterday evening got home close to 6.00pm and decided to drop the boat in at a local spot we fish for cats here in Dover...... We launched close to home and fished a favorite spot of ours....Were not long there when i caught a little Guy        ....Tossed her back and a few minutes later caught a nice channel cat...  Put her back in the water when sins pulled in a little guy also.   a few minutes after that i get a hit rod goes down and i knew i had a big fish on.....Tryed to let off some slack on my line but was to late and lost my whole set up....Man was i ever niffed....lol...  Then before we knew it sun was down so headed back in.....Hope to get back out in the morning.....  even though i spent all weekend working the cart it was nice to be able to get out for a few hrs before sundown......Something tells me i won't be having much time for fishing this summer.... Some of my customers who stopped by for a NAUTIDOG THIS PAST WEEKEND.       Hope everyone had a great easter weekend.  Nauti.
