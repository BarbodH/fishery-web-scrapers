330348,Stoty,2009-04-15 14:45:00,2910,"Alright, considering they start tonight...let's see everyone predictions! This isnt a Habs/Leafs/Sens bashing thread, so please dont turn it into that!  Here is where I see the playoffs going:  First round  Bos over MTL in 6 Wsh over NYR in 5 NJ over CAR in 6 PIT over PHI in 7  SJ over ANA in 7 DET over CBJ in 4 VAN over St.L in 5 CGY over CHI in 7   Second Round  BOS over PIT in 7 NJ over WSH in 7  SJ over CGY in 7 DET over VAN in 6   Third Round  BOS over NJ in 6 DET over SJ in 7   Cup Final  DET over BOS in 6"
330355,dobee,2009-04-15 15:06:00,301,i thought SJ and DET played eachother in the 2nd round?? that is if they both win the 1st round..
330357,troutologist,2009-04-15 15:12:00,951,"You have that much faith in the red wings D and goaltending right now? They need to pull a serious 180 if they want to get out of the 2nd round.  The east is gonna be interesting, especially if certain goalies steal some games"
330364,Stoty,2009-04-15 15:26:00,2910," No its always the highest vs lowest seeds.  SJ is ranked #1, so they will get the team ranked #4 in the second round, and Det (#2) will get the #3 team. They won't meet until the Conference Finals."
330442,charlied,2009-04-15 20:41:00,584,Well I hope its not Detroit in 4 cause I have tickets to game 5...LOL.Mason is too good to get swept! 
330453,Maverick,2009-04-15 21:23:00,371,St Louis vs. Boston final with Boston taking it in 6.
330457,Daplumma,2009-04-15 21:35:00,1961,I wouldn't count Washinton out so early.If they get thru the first round the momentum will carry them a long way.They have last years OT 7th game loss to avenge. Joe
330458,dobee,2009-04-15 21:37:00,301,st. louis??? you crazy!!!  NJ and BOS cant play in the 3rd round.... they will meet in the 2nd round. no?
330498,walleyejigger,2009-04-15 23:03:00,876,"i think it`s gonna be a tough playoff all around, no sweeps,   First round  Bos over MTL in 6 Wsh over NYR in 6 NJ over CAR in 7 PIT over PHI in 5  SJ over ANA in 5 DET over CBJ in 6 VAN over St.L in 7 CHI over CGY in 5   Second Round  BOS over PIT in 7 NJ over WSH in 6  SJ over CHI in 5 DET over VAN in 6   Third Round  NJ over BOS in 7 SJ over DET in 5   Cup Final  NJ over SJ in 7"
330505,NAC,2009-04-15 23:25:00,369,Boston over San Jose in 6 or 7  I soooo would love to see a Caps - Pens series ending with Ovechkin doing a fist pump over Crosby(whiner) after scoring the series winner!
330507,Daplumma,2009-04-15 23:31:00,1961,I like the way you think Mr Nomad. Joe
330516,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-15 23:40:00,3761,"First of all, Congrads to Crosby for lighting up the lamp tonight first, then congrads to Malkin for getting the assist.  Now, my prediction for the 2009 Stanley Cup Winning Team Is:..............................................................The San Jose Sharks, and I always have a back up so that will be my Pittsburgh Penquins!  I either want to see Crosby life up Stanley or Marleau...no other team.     Let the playoffs continue!"
330614,Stoty,2009-04-16 02:02:00,2910," That's what happened to me last year!! Then I missed out on Stanley cup tickets because there was a glitch with ticketmaster's website! I wasnt too impressed to say the least!  Still cant see anyone beating Detroit. When they are on, no team even comes close. And with the addition of Hossa, just makes them even more insane.  I agree that Crosby is a little baby, and I wouldnt want to see him lifting the cup.  Ovechkin deserves it, that's for sure. He is a machine!"
330626,BassAsin,2009-04-16 02:27:00,806, BOS over MTL in 5 NYR over WAS in 6 NJ  over CAR in 6 PHI over PIT in 7  SJ over ANA in 6 CBJ over DET in 6 STL over VAN in 5 CGY over CHI in 7    PHI over BOS in 7 NYR over NJ in 6  SJ over CBJ in 6 CGY over VAN in 6   Third Round  NYR over PHI in 7 SJ over CGY in 7   Cup Final  NYR over SJ  in 6
330628,BassAsin,2009-04-16 02:29:00,806,NO!
330630,Fudd,2009-04-16 02:32:00,94,Van over Bos in 6 ... mark my words.
330718,JohnAB,2009-04-16 12:53:00,178,Boston over Mtl in 6 NYR over Caps in 7 NJD over Hurricanes in 6 Pitts over Philly in 5  SJ over Ducks in 6 CBJ over Detroit in 6 Canucks over Blues in 6 Hawks over Flames in 6  Bos over NYR in 6 Pitts over NJD in 6  SJ over the CBJ in 5 Canucks over Hawks in 6  SJ over Canucks in 7  Bos over Pitts in 7  SJ wins cup in 6
330735,Stoty,2009-04-16 13:46:00,2910,You guys actually think CBJ will take out DET???   Mark them with what...? There is no way that VAN will take out SJ and/or DET.
331004,Northhunter,2009-04-17 00:55:00,214," LUONGO is one. A hot goaltender can steal a series.  There is no ""no way"" in the playoffs. When Edmonton lost to Carolina (luckiest team to ever win the cup, IMO) they took out San Jose, Detroit and Anaheim. 3 powerhouse teams - done away with by the lowly 8th seed."
331008,misfish,2009-04-17 00:58:00,29133,"One is right ,BOS will be there,but thier counter part will be GAL."
331077,holdfast,2009-04-17 03:22:00,1813,"Wow Rangers beating the Capitals,  I guess Avery was his constant self being an instigator, while Josie was his inconsistent self"
331080,Stoty,2009-04-17 03:37:00,2910,Capitals in 5
