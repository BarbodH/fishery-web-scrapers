330979,Spiel,2009-04-17 00:22:00,9065,"Great shots Wayne, I'm not in any of those boats but with a little luck maybe next week."
330980,BillM,2009-04-17 00:23:00,17367,"Wayne, it's starting to get a bit of it's greenish tingle back.  I assume you were down towards the mouth?  I wonder what it looks like up towards 89."
330983,irishfield,2009-04-17 00:26:00,26272,"See pic # 1. Almost got myself in do do following creeks and not paying attention to where I was... almost overflew base Borden on my North bound flight!  Didn't take as many pics as I'd usually... wasn't my personal airplane... so not as comfortable ""knee flying"".."
330986,Joeytier,2009-04-17 00:27:00,3990,"Assuming there's no more rain, do you think it will be good to go come Saturday?"
330987,irishfield,2009-04-17 00:29:00,26272,I don't know.. hasn't rained in well over a week and look at that silt outflow !! There's still lots of snow in the bush and even in drainage ditches in wide open farmers fields.
331012,tinbanger,2009-04-17 01:03:00,1028,Glad to hear you made  it home ok.  Now the question is ...where you gonna put it ?  TB
331016,irishfield,2009-04-17 01:08:00,26272,Right where you parked your van yesterday.. have no choice.    Now what I'm gonna do with the floats from it after I pick them up tomorrow... or the other airplane coming in Saturday.. I have no idea. All I know is I'm never gonna get to the lake....
331023,Terry,2009-04-17 01:12:00,14456,"good, maybe you will be around for the beginning of muskie season"
