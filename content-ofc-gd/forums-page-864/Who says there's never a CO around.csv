330699,Cast-Away,2009-04-16 11:48:00,790,"Wayne, were they at the pond down on Giants Tomb!"

330713,JohnF,2009-04-16 12:45:00,3494,Those gloves look familiar. Does this new hybrid OFNer go by the moniker Irishpaddler or Solofield?  JF

330795,misfish,2009-04-16 16:41:00,29133," Not only the winter time Wayne, but during the fall perch feast here in the bay aswell.Rick is one kean CO.   See what I mean.  If your reading Rick,GREAT JOB."
330796,Carp,2009-04-16 16:42:00,1488,Nice to see the boys and girls in green on the job. Report poachers with as much info as you can gather.  Wish the government would put some more cash into enforcement. I'd like to see the number o CO's in Ontario double. About one third of Canada's population is found in this province and the number of CO's protecting our fish and wildlife should reflect this as well.
330918,ozaibak1,2009-04-16 21:45:00,401,"LOL NICE PHOTOSHOP!!!   Was the green Irish glass edited IN, or OUT, now that is the question"
