330504,purekgw,2009-04-15 23:22:00,585,"i have had it with these poachers, headed down to the grand to day to get some sucker meat for some nice dunville cats when i look over to see this guy fighting a very nice fish after about 5-7min he gets it in and turns out to be a steel head i almost snapped but when i see him throw it against the rocks i had seen all i could take. So we walked to shore and headed over to the guy and just as i thought i see a steel head laying on shore so we make a comment about how there out of season and he pipes up ""o well i have been fishing them all week in hamilton, and they open on the 15"" well Bull today is the 15 so he tries the ""o well i thought they were open""  well after words were passed we left seeing as the fish was already dead, but i snapped a couple pics of his plates and reported him to MNR.  Im done with it next person i see going to keep one im calling OPP on the spot   :angry:  :angry:  :angry:  :angry:  :angry:"
330513,mad_on_fishing,2009-04-15 23:36:00,21,"i know the feeling.. my father and i see a lot of people poaching walleyes, splake, lakers,,,you name it..."
330515,bigugli,2009-04-15 23:40:00,6138,There are a few local regulars down at the Port Maitland pier who keep bass from the beginning of June. I've reported them and haven't seen them pinched yet.
330543,timmeh,2009-04-16 00:31:00,609,"I know how frustrating you feel, and I probably know exactly where you were on the Grand as well. Good for you for saying something and reporting the guy."
330550,purekgw,2009-04-16 00:44:00,585,even walleye people have already started targeting them like there closed for a reason.
330552,Roy,2009-04-16 00:47:00,13728,You seem to run into a lot of that stuff. Maybe the MNR should be following you around.
330553,BassAsin,2009-04-16 00:48:00,806,poaching splake? arent they open year round as they are a man made fish with no size limit?
330554,purekgw,2009-04-16 00:48:00,585,i spend alot of time at the grand what can i say
330557,Gerritt,2009-04-16 00:54:00,6129,Roy... we are literally a minutes walk from the Grand.. Heck it is across the street from me.. all sorts of crazy stuff happens there
330561,Roy,2009-04-16 00:57:00,13728," So, no MNR presence there at all or is it a way of life there?"
330568,Gerritt,2009-04-16 01:02:00,6129,Very few and far between I am afraid Roy... the grand is a large river system.. and it is hard for them to be everywhere... but it seems people from all over come to fish it... mostly from out of town..  G
330570,purekgw,2009-04-16 01:04:00,585,i have only ever seen one officer down there and thats when the steel head open and your lucky to get near the river
330575,Roy,2009-04-16 01:09:00,13728,It kinda sounds like a place to stay away from.Or maybe a place for everybody to show up at to kinda set the pace for other less enlightened anglers.
330578,purekgw,2009-04-16 01:14:00,585,gerritt let me know if you wonna head down with some bats and beat the regs into them
330580,misfish,2009-04-16 01:17:00,29133," SILLY SILLY MAN,,,,,,,OR IS THAT BOY?????????????????  I know the feeling you have burning in yer gut about this,but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,That is not the way to handle this.   Yes??????????????????????"
330583,Gerritt,2009-04-16 01:19:00,6129,"stuff the bat... I like the way I look with blood dripping from my knuckles LOL  as much as I have walked the dogs by the damn etc.. I have ""talked"" to more then few anglers down there... most either dont care or all of a sudden do not speak english.. It would be nice to see some enforcement and education... perhaps a sign in varying languages explaining the seasons, so there can be no doubt... then enforce the laws... perhaps a suggestion to our Mayor is in order...  G."
330587,purekgw,2009-04-16 01:25:00,585,"i was kidding and the sign might work but you will still get people who dont care, laws need to be enforced better by OPP or something i always see cops sitting at the top of the hill by the dam only one has come down and that was to talk to use about good spots to go fishing along the grand with his kids nice guy tho"
330590,misfish,2009-04-16 01:32:00,29133,"Now yer talking my english G.LOL J/K.  That would be a great start,BUT,,,,,,,,,,Were talking dollars here and they say we/they have none."
330721,Gerritt,2009-04-16 12:54:00,6129,Perhaps Caledonia Anglers and Hunters can help.... heck I am for a C note...  G
330753,POLLIWOGG,2009-04-16 14:30:00,835,Get rid of the fishing license and free up some time for the CO's to go after poachers instead of checking everybody for a license..
330848,Radnine,2009-04-16 19:33:00,1538,"I email the Mayor all the time, she reads them all as well (and usually forwards them to the right people). How about a big sign posted by the dam ""The following fish are in season right now.........""or ""nothing in season, if you are fishing now you are breaking the law"". Maybe to differentiate the instruction you could show pictures of what people are allowed to keep. Any sign that is put up though would last about a nano-second before some   spray painted over it. Jim"
330887,misfish,2009-04-16 21:04:00,29133,Jim you are so right about the spray over.IGNORANCE.
330929,ch312,2009-04-16 21:57:00,1590," LMAO...how old are you, 14?"
330931,purekgw,2009-04-16 22:02:00,585,i dont know if i wonna tell u
330962,ch312,2009-04-16 23:40:00,1590, bahahaha!   :lol:
