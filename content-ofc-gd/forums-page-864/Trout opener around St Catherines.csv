330726,krawler,2009-04-16 13:07:00,167,This year will be the first time im missing opener on GBAY rivers.  Ill be in st catherines competing in a salmon derby.  That being said i would love to hit a river or pier in the area for the evening bite.  Any rivers in close proximity that gets a run of fish that i might be able to hook into?  I strictly catch and relase.  No specific locations just names of rivers/creeks unless you want to pm me with more info.  Just rivers or creeks.  i love smaller creeks but will take anything.  thanks
