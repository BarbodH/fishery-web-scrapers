330676,mistaredone,2009-04-16 04:36:00,913,Wow!  Keen eye fisherman!  I will look for replacements.  This forum is a wealth of knowledge.
330703,Mr Twister,2009-04-16 12:07:00,71,Ok I understand the MTO collects the trailer taxes but who collects the boat sale taxes on a used boat?  I thought it was the Vessel registration dept as well?  Thanks
330861,Guest skeeter99,2009-04-16 20:03:00,0,"  youre right one or the other  but the opp are pricks and ask for both, got warned twice for now having paddle now I carry a plastic one from the blow up rafts just to piss them off.  a paddle is a paddle LOL!!!"
330476,mistaredone,2009-04-15 22:23:00,913,"Ok, so I finally bought my first boat   a 1993 15 foot cobra bass boat with a 90 Evenrude tracker pro ( pics to come ) and have been going through all the motions to make it official.  My first trip was to the MTO to get a plate for my home made trailer $35.  Next to a Canada service building to do the pleasure craft licence document.  I was under the impression that this is where I pay taxes on the boat but that was not the case.  Am I missing a step?  Next was saftey gear I price compared BP and CT and I ended saving a bundle at CT.  3 clip Life jackets, entry price CT $20  BP  $40 7 foot boat oars  CT $26  BP $40 Container with rope,light,whistle ect  CT $9  BP $29 1000000 candle power light  CT $12  BP$20 15 foot marine rope  CT $13 Bumpers  CT $9 each or 4 for $34 Solid looking trailer lock  CT $9  Keep in mind the BP gear may or may not be better quality but I was looking to save $$$  I was also wondering about marine audio?  I was looking at the housing for the sterieo witch looked prettey water proof and was wondering if I could get away with a car sterieo?  As for steakers I was thinking of installing them under the deck where they should stay dry.  Is this just a bad idea?  Can I get speaker covers that are water proof for my car speakers?  Other than Audio Im installing battarie guages for the trolling and starting motors.  I should be on the water by Friday, ready for the warm weather.  As always thanks for all the help.  Still trying to load pics.  "
330481,Roy,2009-04-15 22:33:00,13728,Congrats on the boat purchase. Boat licensing is just that. It has nothing to do with taxes. It has to do with having a boat number to identify the vessel. I have no idea why you want oars for a bass boat. Am I missing something here?
330482,Guest skeeter99,2009-04-15 22:36:00,0, he needs oars because it is the law  you must have a paddling device
330483,Gerritt,2009-04-15 22:36:00,6129,"First of all congrats!!  Hmmm.... the MTO should have collected the taxes... but since they did not.... they could however come back later on for them... not uncommon.  I would suggest more then 15' of rope.. and would definatly have at least two lengths on board..  one for bow and stern as well as one for miscellaneous purposes (ie. towing etc)  I picked up my housing at Cabela's for cheaper then I could get it here if I remember correctly...  I purchased a marine stereo kit (CD,MP3 and radio + two weather proof speakers) for 149.00 + taxes and built two small boxes for the speakers  Good luck! now the fun begins!  Cant wait to see the pix!  G"
330484,Gerritt,2009-04-15 22:36:00,6129,  Unless you have a trolling motor..  G
330486,Roy,2009-04-15 22:40:00,13728,Actually no. You need oars OR an anchor. Re-read the regs. I have one oar in mine to help pole me out of a shallow situation but not required legally.
330488,Tom McCutcheon,2009-04-15 22:42:00,627,I thought an anchor was also a must.
330489,mistaredone,2009-04-15 22:43:00,913,I was thinking regs when buying but they are also great to push off stumps and rocks when in the shallows.
330499,Fisherman,2009-04-15 23:10:00,7201,"Oh, can you please post the reference for that.  Hate to see someone get dinged.."
330500,Roy,2009-04-15 23:14:00,13728,A trolling motor has nothing to do with this.
330501,Sinker,2009-04-15 23:17:00,8692,"Roy has it right, you need an anchor OR paddles. I always have both on board, and an electric.  Make sure your light floats and it has good batteries. If it doesn't work, it won't pass.  Haved fun with the new ride........there is always something else that you ""need"" for a boat.  Sinker"
330502,irishfield,2009-04-15 23:20:00,26272, One or the other... not worth the arguement though with some OPP.. have both!  Gerritt... the MTO does not collect taxes for boats.. trailers yes.  Crap shoot.. he may or may not get a letter from Oshawa looking for said PST.
330503,mistaredone,2009-04-15 23:22:00,913,Sweet!  Pics are finally small enough.  
330506,Gerritt,2009-04-15 23:28:00,6129,My understanding was you needed another method of propulsion period....  And Wayne.. the MTO will collect the taxes on the entire package not just the trailer.. as I found out when I purchased Spiel's old boat.
330508,irishfield,2009-04-15 23:33:00,26272, They will.. but they don't have the legal capacity to collect taxes on a federally registered item !  You shouldn't have and you should have had a bill for the trailer.. and the boat seperate.
330518,Muskieman,2009-04-15 23:42:00,2472,I was pulled over for speeding in a no wake zone....clocked @ 15 in a 9 kph zone ....  They stripped searched the boat and this is how it went...as I recall.   from a checklist.:  life jackets.. paddles.. whistle.. bailing bucket.. anchor and rope.... 40' throw rope..working flashlight...good registration and ID.  I also have a fire extinguisher on board and a survival kit.. they gave me kudos for that. They let me off with a warning for speeding and that was that.  Enjoy the New Boat...  As for the stereo   an automotive unit will last for years so long as you buy the 25$ cover....   RFS 
330521,Roy,2009-04-15 23:45:00,13728,"Your understanding and the regulations are two different things. For any powered boat under 19'8"", this is what you need.   It should also be noted that an anchor with the required length of rope/cable/chain is a far better propelling device than an oar."
330533,Rizzo,2009-04-16 00:15:00,4754, as long as you're in water less than 50 feet deep!
330547,tinbanger,2009-04-16 00:36:00,1028,Nice looking boat  looks in great shape esp for a 16 yr old boat!  TB
330551,mistaredone,2009-04-16 00:46:00,913,Thanks!  The boat was stored indoors and the motor is a1.  $5000 with trailer seemed a good deal compared to whats been on the market in the last few months.
330556,Roy,2009-04-16 00:52:00,13728,"You did good, Mistaredone. I hope you have a great many years with your boat."
330559,Fudd,2009-04-16 00:56:00,94,"Nice boat matey, for that price you got a deal. I hope that it is blessed with many fish.  Keep your lines tight  Dave"
330560,fishinfool,2009-04-16 00:57:00,366,"That's a really nice looking ride, I especially like your ""home made trailer"". LOL Now you just have to get used to backing it in and taking it out in under two minutes at the launch.  SS"
330574,mistaredone,2009-04-16 01:08:00,913,LOL!  Yeah I could spend hours watching guys at the launch. Now I get to be that guy.
330617,Fisherman,2009-04-16 02:06:00,7201,"One thing I noticed on your trailer, the safety cables, they don't have safety clips on the hooks."
