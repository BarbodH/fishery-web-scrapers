330736,Joeytier,2009-04-16 13:49:00,3990,"I was considering going to this, but I can't really afford it at the moment.  I'd be more desperate to go had I not gone to see them last March.  Easily the best show I've ever attended."
330778,Carp,2009-04-16 15:41:00,1488,"    I was at the ACC last March as well. First ever Iron Maiden show for me. Awesome show.  Got there early and Bruce was back stage talking to a couple of guys. They spotted me pointing the camera and tried to stand in front of him to block my view. Then, he walked right by me (standing at the tunnel) to go get ready for the show, but I wasn't prepared for it and missed the opportunity for a pic.  Had the first seat at the right front corner of the stage, near the bands entrance/exit tunnel. Got some nice pics and video. A few pics and video of them clowning around back stage too.  Bruce looked right at me a number of times during the show (with camera at the ready), then made a comment during the show about people and their audio/visual/picture/digital stuff and it was obvious it ticked him off a bit. Then told the fans he couldn't do anything about it, but they knew who the people were and could do something. It's probably a good thing I didn't try and stop him for a pic when he walked by."
