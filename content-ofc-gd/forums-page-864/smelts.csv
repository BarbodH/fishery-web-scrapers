328088,waterwolf,2009-04-09 02:06:00,556,"nothin' buzzin' yet, will let you know if things start up.  make some calls ,,should be soon for sure."
328092,BassAsin,2009-04-09 02:10:00,806,perfect they usually start 3-4 days later here that southern ontario   K-W brampton that kind of area
328863,fishboy,2009-04-11 14:40:00,550,still haven't heard anything yet
328893,Big Cliff,2009-04-11 17:29:00,6899,"My son lives in Noelville (French River), I was talking to him yesterday and he was telling me that a few of the guys have been reporting getting some. He kind of thought that they should be starting this weekend."
328951,Sinker,2009-04-11 21:05:00,8692,"This full moon usually gets them going, but the water is still really cold. Its always worth a shot though......  Sinker"
330043,quickme,2009-04-14 19:33:00,261,"anyone know if they have started on Lake Simcoe yet. ( sibbalds, jackson's point, Beaverton?)"
330046,misfish,2009-04-14 19:57:00,29133," Heard today at work, they were just starting to trickle in.I would say this weekend will be the start and the finish."
330316,quickme,2009-04-15 13:02:00,261,  awesome..  I'm going on Friday.  Thank you!!!
330801,hookerdown,2009-04-16 16:52:00,110,You fish for smelt using a dip net or seine net.  Some guys on Simcoe catch them while ice fishing using a glass bead and a small treble.
330802,pike slayer,2009-04-16 16:53:00,1177,"waders, smelt net and flash light or what works better is one of those head strap lights"
330836,smokin joe,2009-04-16 18:51:00,226,They're in on the Niagara from what I hear
330844,misfish,2009-04-16 19:18:00,29133,"You would not believe some of the contraptions that are set up,by these smelt fanatics. One guy I remember very well,had christmas lights strung up along the rods of his net.In the water.LOL Another group had a wench set up. Sit and crank the net up.  Me,when we did it,drop the net (didnt need a light cause there were enough to light up a small town),start haull,n up, hand over hand."
330845,misfish,2009-04-16 19:22:00,29133,"I should,no must add.You guys that bring generators out on the docks,and it,s in a populated area,not very cool.It,s late at night and people dont need to hear it.There are bylaws,even tho some may think they are silly,but they are there and I know here in the Barrie area,they will enforce them. Alot of good areas have been posted with no parking the last couple of years,due to noise and ignorance."
330854,BassAsin,2009-04-16 19:45:00,806,"went out last night and hauled in 15 pounds of them 482 to be exact, enough pike bait for all of next year on the ice. already salted bagged and in the freezer, goin tonight to get a snack of them for myself and a few others."
330855,BassAsin,2009-04-16 19:48:00,806,"just use a dip net swipe with the current scraping bottom and lifting up hard, as for the lights a small flashlight to see where your going and to find your spot if they're running they're running no need to shine the light on the water it simply spooks them is all."
