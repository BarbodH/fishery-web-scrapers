330903,Rizzo,2009-04-16 21:28:00,4754,"Last summer I know the owner had some heart issues. A few times I went there and they were not open, it was kind of hit and miss. I had heard that he was recovering well so to hear he may have died (see above) is a bit of a surprise. It has been for sale for quite some time"
