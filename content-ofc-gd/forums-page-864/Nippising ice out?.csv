329940,duber,2009-04-14 13:43:00,220,Just wondering if the ice is on its way out on Nippising yet.My buddy bought a new Alumicraft up there and has to wait till they can test his boat before he can pick it up.He don't say much but I'm sure he is going bonkers waiting for that magical day when he can go get his new boat.We have been fishing open water down here for 2 weeks now and I'm sure thats not helping much.  Thanks

329953,Bernie,2009-04-14 14:25:00,3190,"Nipissing still for the most part is ice covered. Fish Bay is about half open but that happened a couple weeks ago. Some has since refrozen Be at least two weeks yet, more cold weather next week. yuuuk!"

330610,Northhunter,2009-04-16 01:57:00,214,Will be a while yet. Anything with current opened up quick. Everything else is gonna be a couple weeks.  I took a drive north on the weekend looking for ice-out brookie/splake prospects and they are still ICE FISHING!!!  This is only an hour north of Suds.

330619,Bernie,2009-04-16 02:08:00,3190,Fish Bay is open. There was just a little ice out from the dock.
