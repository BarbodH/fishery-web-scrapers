A buddy and I decided we were going to have a shot at some crappie last night, so we got all suited up and took off, it was a late start, but we just wanted to go to get out ! We were fishing with minnows about 8"" below the float. Not very deep at all. It was a pretty slow night, I got one hooked but being the rookie crappie angler I am, I set the hook a little to hard. The next bite and I was on. That was pretty much the action for the evening. Everyone was getting the odd bite, but they were barley hitting. Altogether we landed 2 fish in about an hour and a half.  :wallbash:  I went out with a couple friends tonight and we were all using a small tube under a float... That was my first try with one, but they fish with them a lot I guess, any how, none of us got a fish. So after a couple hours I packed it in and went for dinner !  Here are some pictures of the fish from the first night !      Thanks for looking , although there is not much to look at !   :P"
