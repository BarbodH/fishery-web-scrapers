324900,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-01 15:17:00,2050,"Hey guys - first off I'm going to get 1 thing out of the way.  Anybody who see's this thread as ""spam"" will have to deal with it.  I've been a part of OFC since long before I even met Dave, and as a member of OFC have every right to try and get some of the gang together, and what could be a better excuse?  Anyways - I'll be at all the show's, bust seeing as London is my closest major Center, and where I spend most of my time when I have to ""run into town"" I was thinking maybe we could set up a London OFC G2G on the 16th.  I was thinking everybody could hit up the FOF Live Seminars with Dave, JP (both OFNER's) and Paul Powis, then head out for a couple cold ones afterwards?  Or if you bring the family for the show maybe go somewhere that the kiddies could accompany us?  Who's in?  I've never been able to make it out to a London G2G and would love to meet some of you guys.  C'mon Brian - Let's get'er done!!!  Cheers, Ryan"

326140,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-04 12:08:00,2050,"Hey guys - Let's try to gather up a bit more of the london crew, and try to figure out a place to meet.  Anybody know of a place we could have a few drinks but also maybe have the family tag along.  I'm fairly certain my wife (8.5 months pregnant lol ) and 2 year old will be tagging along...?  Cheers, Ryan"
326154,trapshooter,2009-04-04 13:22:00,1234,"I'm pretty sure the London crew usually meets at a place at the NE corner of Southdale and Wharencliff Rd, Jacks maybe?  Waaay back in the day we used to meet at Bernies, which is on Adelaide just south of Oxford (ask Roy, haha).  It certainly doesn't matter to me, I'm not even 100% sure if I can make it yet."
327495,jjcanoe,2009-04-07 15:14:00,744,"Final Score was where the London G2G have been recently. Since the ownership change, the best wings in town have gotten horrible (in my opinion) My vote would be to go to the Alibi on Oxford just east of Wharncliffe.  jjcanoe"
327521,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-07 16:22:00,2050,I've been to alibi on several occasions...might have to book some seating with them though....any thoughts on this guys?
327580,trapshooter,2009-04-07 18:51:00,1234,alibi is fine with me.  What time?
327677,Dnthmn,2009-04-07 22:40:00,128,The Alibi sounds good to me.  Did you want someone to make a call Ryan?
327697,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-07 23:25:00,2050," I'll do a quick poll or role call on the board when I get a chance to get an estimate on numbers and then if you want you  can make a call, or I can doesn't make a difference to me!"
328141,TDunn,2009-04-09 07:16:00,680,Alibi sounds great to me....   Tyler
330054,trapshooter,2009-04-14 20:20:00,1234,"Sorry gang, as it turns out I won't be able to make it thursday."
330287,scugpg,2009-04-15 10:43:00,1373,heard the Sarnia show was awesome! Looking forward to seeing it in London tomorrow
330471,Handlebarz,2009-04-15 22:16:00,3790,check out the thread that TJ started I posted some pics there from Sarnia and yes it was awesome.
330787,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-16 16:20:00,2050,"Hey guys!  What a week so far!  The crowds have been awesome the past two nights!

330797,TDunn,2009-04-16 16:42:00,680,I was going to go to the Alibi at oxford and wharncliffe right after the show..... Post if this works for you...  TDunn
330872,Dnthmn,2009-04-16 20:44:00,128,  I thought that was the plan as well. I might not be able to make the show depending on whether or not I want sleep but will try and meet up with everyone after for sure.  Cheers.
330952,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-16 23:10:00,2050,Shows about to start.  Packed house again!
331035,Dnthmn,2009-04-17 01:32:00,128,"well guys, I slept in a little longer than I wanted to and looks like I won;t be able to make it out tonight. Hope everyone had a good time at the show!"
