From what i've been reading Fresh cut bait seems the best.. Is there a baitstore there I can buy a couple suckers, as I'm sure now you can't use fish from other water bodies.  And i'll be fishing from shore: Where can you park and where is your best bet to catch them.  Any help will be most appreciated"
