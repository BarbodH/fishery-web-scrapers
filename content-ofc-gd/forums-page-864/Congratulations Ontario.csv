330842,misfish,2009-04-16 19:10:00,29133," Can you believe they have had one for the last 3 mornings,6AM yes 6AM on Fairview dr.People are heading to work,and ya maybe a bit late and got the peddel pushed a little harder 50 km is the limit(which is way to slow for that area). 6AM,they better be serving coffee when they say,have a nice day."
330916,2 tone z71,2009-04-16 21:41:00,1311,"yeah why not pick on the working class taxpayer, where easy targets ,dont worry about protecting  us from the child molesters, Kiddie diddlers,drug dealers or such,get the important  easy things in life a speeder"
330941,irishfield,2009-04-16 22:32:00,26272,Nobody bothered me doing 132 MPH back from Brampton this afternoon.....
330945,Cudz,2009-04-16 22:55:00,2652,It's hard to do 50 up by that McD's just before it turns into BBP rd.  I often look down and am pushing 80 through there.
331002,Cookslav,2009-04-17 00:52:00,1457," Yup nothing spurs an economy like taking away any disposable income we have left, and increasing our cost of living a few percent...oh wait does that make sence? yup....he's an  I like the feds idea about 100x better, but then again...not like I'll see any of it."
331003,JohnF,2009-04-17 00:54:00,3494, They didn't look up.  JF
331034,tinbanger,2009-04-17 01:30:00,1028," That where i got my last ticket ( 6 years ago) no points just paid a $175 ""admin fee"" and took a drivers safety review ( 15 min) at the  cop shop. Kingston was doing the same untill it was challenged in court .  cash grab ? Nah  TB"
331040,siwash,2009-04-17 01:44:00,683,"  Now if only Quebec would give us back the 10's of billions we've given them to protect their language and culture and day care programs!! that'd be something, huh?  lol"
331061,Cudz,2009-04-17 02:30:00,2652,Wow.  Between your Habs thread and this statement you are sure to win over our boys from Hull (Gatineau) and Roy.  Having said that I don't think Leechman likes the Habs anyway.
331071,holdfast,2009-04-17 03:01:00,1813," Well, is he wrong?  You might find that he may be right weather some people like it or not.  Actually Ontario gave out 60% of its Share to Quebec alone on the so called Equalization.  Being a former Quebecer.  There is no way in the world that they should be pampered with their resources and manufacturing.  They got more than just Hydro.  I have seen once one of the Most Beautiful cities, and I may add most Modern in that it was a World marvel, turn into a crumbling dump.  Coincidentally, it started falling Apart when the Head Offices moved out over, Ill just say, Political reasons."
330104,holdfast,2009-04-14 22:38:00,1813,Heard on the Radio that you recieved your first check of 24 from the Feds for being a have not Province.  Spend it wisely because I still have family in Ottawa.
330108,Cudz,2009-04-14 22:42:00,2652,Well I guess it is our turn to finally get some rather than give some.  Doesn't make up for the past 100 years of Ontario paying for most other provinces but at least it is a start.
330143,HTHM,2009-04-14 23:51:00,4082,WHY YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE??? I'm callin' you on this one. How long ago were you an Ontarioan? 2 - 3 years? Is this you or Jack talkin?
330146,irishfield,2009-04-15 00:49:00,26272,"Cheque... where.. when.. how do I get one??  Maybe this is why the OFC ""light"" went out for a bit ! lol"
330150,Terry,2009-04-15 00:52:00,14456,"well it was only a couple of years ago that the fed gov said ontario will get some money when hell freezes over, so when OFC went down I started thinking it's servers must be in hell"
330154,misfish,2009-04-15 00:54:00,29133, Thank god for poker stars.LOL J/K
330156,wiggler,2009-04-15 00:57:00,16,Are we talkin' beer?
330158,e-z-out,2009-04-15 00:59:00,1052,I'm with wayne on this one where can i get some money
330159,misfish,2009-04-15 01:01:00,29133,"  THIS COULD BE GOOD FOR SAY, 12 ROUNDS.  hometownhandyman ,Im not all knowing, but have read enough of your threads to realize that, you know what you are talking about.  Fair game ALL."
330197,cram,2009-04-15 01:50:00,1733,"Its going to be even more have-not over the next couple of years (or longer).  Anyone noticed way more speed traps lately?   As in, WAY more?   Province needs dough."
330214,Cudz,2009-04-15 02:25:00,2652,I might have called him in a thread that I made but it quickly got shut down and deleted.  Quite fairly I might add.
330218,holdfast,2009-04-15 02:29:00,1813,"Yup Albert, unreal.  Ontario once the mightest province.  Who would think that after all these years it ended up like this. Ontario has a special place in my heart.  15 years and great fishing.  I may still may retire in the Petawawa Area though"
330224,gone_fishin,2009-04-15 02:36:00,481,"  OH YEAH!!! like every other day i see them! tons of traps out lately... haven't been on the highway much lately, but on smaller streets (especially 80km zones that turn into 60km zones)... they are there!!!"
330229,kickingfrog,2009-04-15 02:43:00,8333,"Canada's population- over 33 million Ontario population- 11 plus million (someone else can look-up the exact #'s)  That is pretty close to 1/3 or 33% of the people. That is a lot of tax dollars.... Have, or have not.  A country, a company or a family is only as strong as it's poorest, laziest or weakest member."
330240,Joey,2009-04-15 03:18:00,9122,"Well my son got one, but Paul and I certainly didn't     That's 1 out of 3.  pretty crappy average if you ask me!"
330246,Greencoachdog,2009-04-15 03:26:00,8163,Ontario???...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLMkV7VyPns
330295,Jer,2009-04-15 11:48:00,1426,That was hilarious...
330320,Marko,2009-04-15 13:13:00,854," Ohhh that's just dirty!! How bad is it when you have to make you cop car look like a cab so you can give out few tickets. I remember few years ago there were couple supt up cars that cops would drive around and nail street racers, cant blame them for that really but the cab trick is just dirty lol"
330342,JohnF,2009-04-15 14:27:00,3494," Hey! That's not a bad idea. As long as the LEO's are just cruising around establishing a visual presence, clocking speeders, and burning gas, why not pick up a little gas money from folks needing a ride?  JF"
330360,kemper,2009-04-15 15:17:00,2232,"and here I thought CANADA meant the whole country...apparently some people think there is an imaginary line somewhere around Winnipeg, and another around Ottawa."
330433,cranks bait,2009-04-15 20:08:00,721," When I lived out west the cops used to have ski racks with skis in them on top of their cars?  As for checks?  I haven't seen one.  Must be one of the three lies, I love you, the checks in the mail, and I won't c.... can't repeat here."
330437,Jer,2009-04-15 20:28:00,1426,I just got a cheque today...pretty sure it's just some of my own money back though...
330477,JohnF,2009-04-15 22:28:00,3494," Sorry to burst yer bubble, my friend, but you will learn that there are all kinds of lines drawn in our society. Perhaps (hopefully) your generation will be the one to wipe them out and bring about the world we idealized in the 60's and 70's, the one all about flower power, peace and love. I don't mean that to sound particularly profound, or naive. It's just that throughout my life I've constantly run into real and imagined boundaries and lines my friends and I are not to cross, that divide Canucks from other Canucks, or Canucks from Americans, etc. The funny (and I use the word loosely) thing is that when we're able to forget the boundaries of race, class and income we all have a lot more fun. Despite that it seems that just when I start to thinking I've transcended all those lousy boundaries I discover that I'm still a closet bigot in some subtle or peculiar way. I see major improvements in my son over me in that respect so I hope it means that for all the big talk from us old farts, you young guns are getting it righter (more right?).  JF"
330496,Greencoachdog,2009-04-15 23:01:00,8163,"  You forgot ""I'm from the government, and I'm here to help you!"""
330602,ctdd2006,2009-04-16 01:49:00,531,"As a 32 y/o ""young guy"" (I think).....I say cheers to you JohnF!"
