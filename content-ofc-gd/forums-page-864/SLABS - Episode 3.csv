Always nice to get the first slab, because they come in a group... I find them to be a nice fish - the pictures don't capture the purple sheen or the mirror shine under the scales...    This fellow is around 13"" in length - with his lips extended!! Otherwise only 12""...   Another Dinnerplate Slab!!   Total of 6 slabs were invited over for dinner...  I'm having fun this spring with the Crappie!!! I hear that the season is later around central Ontario... Good luck to all when it opens there... O4T "
330961,GBW,2009-04-16 23:38:00,8460,nice looking meal there for sure.
331018,frozen-fire,2009-04-17 01:09:00,542,omg... you are slaying them...  good job out there they sure beat all the tiny ones i've been catching. can't wait until zone 17 opener... i'm hoping for ones that look more like yours  and i know what you're talking about with the colour...they can be gorgeous.
331031,ozaibak1,2009-04-17 01:23:00,401,Wow that first slab is a beauty! Way to go you're slaying them! You fishing off a dock or by boat?
331078,Out4Trout,2009-04-17 03:22:00,98, I've done both shore and boat this spring - the last two reports (larger slabs) were caught from my boat... shallow water without shore access.
331079,Zubris21,2009-04-17 03:28:00,563,"beauty slabs!  Im also from eastern on, not currently there but will be back in the summer... how far east are you fishing?"
331090,Out4Trout,2009-04-17 04:02:00,98,Hi freshwaterfanatic I'm NE of Kingston. They're pulling a few slabs in along the Rideau as well...
