This is nothing like you have ever seen before. And by the looks of it, it has extreme potential getting BIG Bass out of there holes.  But it looks like a kids toy."

330665,Bondar,2009-04-16 03:15:00,817,Do you work for these guys ?? Thats the second post promoting them just curious

330800,Roninramirez,2009-04-16 16:51:00,19,"Thanks for blowing my cover as possing as a OFC member. Geezzz . I was about to offer a 99% employee discount on Shimano Core 100MG & 100MGFV.  But seriously guys that Kinder Surprise lure could be an advantage over tough situations and as for working for thetackelwareshouse.com I wish !!!   Another resource site is http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=TheLureTour&view=videos  They feature underwater footage of lures, so you know what action they produce before buying."

330873,ADB,2009-04-16 20:45:00,444,What will they think of next...  It looks like something my cat would play with.
330880,GoneFishin,2009-04-16 21:00:00,349,I don't care if they are promoting them! I'm gonna make some of my own and give them a shot this year! Those look great. Thank for posting the link.

Whether this poster works for an advertiser or not I don't think its that important, what is important is what their post contains which I found to be somewhat relevant. If anything, this could show the advertiser the potential of this board. I think this board has HUGE advertising potential, I've seen a few good targeted ads in the banner but I still have to say I don't click on most, they've gotta be real good to get my click.  But back to the video, I was expecting to see a fish hit the bait... did I miss something? It's the result that gets people 'hooked' thats why people can sell a piece of plastic (the line dancer I think) for money because people see a big fish and say COOOOL I can do that too!!!"
330997,mbac31,2009-04-17 00:45:00,904,"Dont Bother. I got roped into buying that last fall. The thing is junk. Tacklewarehouse even has them on sale now from the previous higher price. They are still a great bunch of guys to do business with. Its for bedding fish I think. I caught fish on it but not that great. If you want a realalistic craw, Try buying the Huddle Bug. I have great success with them."
