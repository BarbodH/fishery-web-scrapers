9022,Josh Rogers,2006-12-06 19:34:00,79,"Hey everyone. Was just wondering if anyone is going out steelheading this week. If so would you be kind enough to post trib conditions please. ie colour, current speed and any fish caught. Thanks all ATF"
9024,tonyb,2006-12-06 19:38:00,1637,"You won't get too many replies to that sort of question  Anyway, the conditions in most Lake O tribs should be ideal right now, with clearing water conditions.  With not much rain in the forecast, expect low-clear water conditions by the weekend.  Get out there and give us a report. Tony"
9030,Josh Rogers,2006-12-06 19:47:00,79,I was thinking about going down to wet a line on friday afternoon. Wanted to go tomorow but have a job interview and an exam that I gotta do so I think it will be friday for sure.  the thing of it is I have to drive at least an hour to get to a trib and like to know what the conditions are before I go so I don't waste what precious little money I have at the moment to get there.
9032,solopaddler,2006-12-06 19:48:00,8605,"I'll be fishing Ohio tribs later this week, would be happy to pm you with details if you so desire"
9034,Josh Rogers,2006-12-06 19:49:00,79,Sure that would be great. Thanks man
9048,dgr8t1,2006-12-06 20:18:00,15,"the conditions are always fine now. Inspecially since the cold came in. Just try any tribe and don't give up, it takes a while but somethings gotta give. You also need a lot of patience but when they hit it'll all be worth it.  cheers and great fishing"
9096,charlied,2006-12-06 22:29:00,584,"Niagara is still dirty....managed to get 3of 4  fish today!  Only about 8"" visibility"
9117,FishFinder,2006-12-06 23:10:00,481,"got skunked today at my fav trib, visiblity was very low"
9122,Canuck2fan,2006-12-06 23:17:00,1444,"One caught on Tuesday at my second favorite trib, heard nothing happened on my first favorite though. Water conditions were PERFECT just nothing happening except one fish who just couldn't resist the half dead worm I was using at the time....."
9144,brickNblock,2006-12-07 00:05:00,598,"Ive hit my Trib every morning this week. Nadda, nadda, nadda.......Ive been there before tho Ive walked this trib since the mid seventys and know just about every hole there is to There are fish there always... you have to spend the time to find out what they want that day.. Some days you have to pay special attention to your approach to the river side so's not to spook and on other days you may have to drift from the opposite side of the water. Either way, the fish are always there no matter the cons.... Time on the water is whats it all about Ill be at 'er again tommorrow. Best of luck to you.  Using an assortment of sizes and colours of both troutNsalmon eggs right now."
9155,huntervasili,2006-12-07 00:18:00,1604,I m gonna hit the credit on friday I think so ill tell ya what i see... Maybe i will have some luck
9172,brookieman,2006-12-07 00:39:00,68,"Did fairly well today.  Water was pretty good, fairly clear.  I love fishin in December."
9183,camillj,2006-12-07 00:50:00,1988,This is (almost) my favourite time for chrome .. they dont get much fiestier ... water in the small tribs is IDEAL ... bigger ones are a little touch and go between the rain and the snow its alot of fluctuation from one to the next .. got a pretty good snow today so Credit is muddy again .. but eastward ... its all good !
9210,ccmtcanada,2006-12-07 01:17:00,7971,"Never tried trib fishing before, but there are lots around me.  I'd love to hook into one of those awesome looking steelies!!!!"
