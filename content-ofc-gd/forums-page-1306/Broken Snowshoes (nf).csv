9564,TJQ,2006-12-07 21:25:00,7806,I'm looking for a couple of pairs of broken snowshoes to try to repair... anybody got any kicking around in the garage??
9566,Whopper,2006-12-07 21:31:00,2174,"No snowshoes TJ, but I do have a couple pair of old work boots that I use to cut the grass with that you can have.    Whopper"
9567,douG,2006-12-07 21:34:00,2693,How about socks?  Do you do socks?  I have a few pairs with pink spots on them.
9572,Uncle Buck,2006-12-07 21:50:00,1000,"if anyone sends me a pair, i'll sit on them, that'll break them for sure. then we can send them to TJ...  group effort LOL"
9575,TJQ,2006-12-07 21:55:00,7806,Ohhhhhhh..... you guys are alot of help.....   you must be  a riot when somebody hurts theselves... lol
9580,irishfield,2006-12-07 22:06:00,26272,You talkin the wood frame busted or the stringin?? I'll go check the many pairs hanging on the hangar wall. Shipping would be the profitless side of this.....
9582,Daplumma,2006-12-07 22:08:00,1961,I may have a pair I wore the treads off of .Not much snow here and the gravel tears them up.
9588,TJQ,2006-12-07 22:25:00,7806,"Doesnt matter what shape they are in....  if the woods broken thats ok too...  I can get the stuff to repair them, so i just want to see what kind of a job I could do...  And no art.. no gravelly ones...  geeezzzzz"
9705,Ron,2006-12-08 04:56:00,1683,"  Geez TJ, the reputation you have with equipment, I am surprised you couldn't fill out this request yourself!"
9808,pameladallaire,2006-12-08 16:13:00,470,"You can't have mine, we use them to decorate the house when they are too worn.  Pam"
9814,Headhunter,2006-12-08 16:42:00,5703,"Dirty Snowshoe recipe; 1 part Jack Daniels 1 part Peppermint Schnapps ice, stir and enjoy!!! Darn, different type of snow shoe! HH"
