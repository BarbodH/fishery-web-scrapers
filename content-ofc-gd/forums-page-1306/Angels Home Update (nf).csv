9241,camillj,2006-12-07 01:51:00,1988,A few months ago I posted about my aunt who had sold everything including her home and belongings to be able to build a childrens home in ethiopia.  I wanted to post an update as construction has begun and during this time of sharing I know there are many who would love this story...  Here's an article published in the Malta Times about her project http://www.kifinti.com/angels_home  And here's a pic of the new home under construction :    PM me if you would like information about helping her
