8922,Terry,2006-12-06 15:53:00,14456,"welcome aboard so what do you fish for.....  for many of us right now..not much fishing, boats are put away and waiting for ice to get thick"
8926,shawnf,2006-12-06 15:56:00,46,"Welcome to the boards!  These guys can definitely give you great advice, as I've been poking around myself picking up a wealth of information, and it appears I'll be following your posts as well!  I think I've gathered enough intel to kick my boss's ass next year when we head to the great lakes for salmon fishing.  Of course... there never is enough information for me, so all your tips are very well appreciated!"
8927,Josh Rogers,2006-12-06 15:57:00,79,I fish for pretty much everything. In the last year I have gotten right into steelhead and salmon fishing. In my first year I have caught 2 chinook 1 coho 1 brown and too many steelhead to count. The thing I like about fishin the tribs is you don't need a boat so you don't have to worry if its put away.
