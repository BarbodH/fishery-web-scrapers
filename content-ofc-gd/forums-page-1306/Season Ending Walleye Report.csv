9167,Carp,2006-12-07 00:35:00,1488," Wayne, my friends at Advanced Taxidermy have walleye moulds up to at least 17 or 19lbs. Should be no problem to get a replica made of the 15lber. I've seen their 15 lb. mould and the finished product personally.  Super catch blyght. You should be very proud of such a magnificent fish."
9174,wuchikubo,2006-12-07 00:41:00,1114,"Cliff and Carole,  Awesome report again! Congrats on the new PB!  I hope your luck continues on the ice, it'll be nice to see your reports if it continues like it has.  Stan"
9205,ShaunB,2006-12-07 01:10:00,73,Some beautiful fish u have there...may I ask...BOQ or Lake o.  It is getting pretty cold for fishing especially at night.  Looks like you had a great spot for your wally season.  I haven't been out for them since I wsa fishing the Kawarthras...and that was up until the 15th.
9213,ccmtcanada,2006-12-07 01:21:00,7971, Thanks fishindevil.  The pleasure of meeting you and fishergirl72 was all ours.  We'll get together again soon....maybe even over the holidays to trade more fishing stories!  Thanks again for takin me under your wing on your new boat....I learned TONS that day.  Cliff
9324,ccmtcanada,2006-12-07 03:16:00,7971," Well....Since BOQ is technically Lake O, my answer is Lake O"
9361,Squid,2006-12-07 04:10:00,1656,That is just awesome way to go team!! I am with Yo on this one. The two fo you went out and did it on your own. Congrats Carole on the 15 lber.
9509,Bly,2006-12-07 17:56:00,1556,Thanks Squid and Yo!   There is a special kind of satisfaction when a reward like that comes from hours and hours and did I say hours? of working for it  blyght
9045,Bly,2006-12-06 20:18:00,1556," I am mostly clueless when it comes to this process......never thought I would catch anything worth mounting!  Any suggestions on where to start, who to contact etc would be much appreciated!     Thanks Don!  When I was a kid my brother and I would ice fish......never had a hut though....we used to build a fire on the ice and take our skates to help keep us warm.  Not sure if we will be doing any this year but after a month or so without fishing.....you might hear from us.  In regards to next years reports, I am not sure I can ever come close to a season like this again, but definitely going to try   I wanted to thank everyone also for your remarks on the non-release, I feel a bit better about it now.  blyght"
