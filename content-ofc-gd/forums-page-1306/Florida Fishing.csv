9124,setomonkey,2006-12-06 23:24:00,872,"Goran,  There's a good forum at this website: Florida Sportsman  And I've found a couple of guides now through this website, but not in the Pompano Beach area. Cyberangler  Crazyhook has fished in Florida a lot, I'm sure he'll jump in if he sees this thread.  Have fun, I'm going to Florida in February and hope to do a little bass fishing and maybe some saltwater shore-fishing...  Mike"

The sailfish bite is happening on the Southern coast, if you want to charter a boat elt me know and I will let you know some names if you can't hook up with osmone frmo the board.  Also if you want to drive a bit the peacock bass ( yes the same ones form Brozil) are biting arund Miami... also I will PM you some spots if you are interested.  If you like shore fishing there are three piers close to there ( Pompano), deerfield and Anglins)  Bring a few rods with you and I can let you know what tackle to bring down  Bass pro IN lauderdale is worth thr visit and the IGFA is right beside it. If you have some Blls... fish the lake in front of bass pro! loaded with bass including some 7 pound peacocks!  set a monkey.. where in Florida you going in feb? I am working on something right now...  Also UB check out www.boatlessfishing.com good shore site with erports and people post reports on whats biting at the pier"

9321,setomonkey,2006-12-07 03:13:00,872,"ch,  we're going to be in Orlando for a couple of days, and then off to stay at an inn on the east coast.  Any suggestions welcome. The inn we are staying at is on the waterfront so I might do a little fishing off their pier. They've got a canoe & kayak for guests to use too.  Mike"
9335,Crazyhook,2006-12-07 03:26:00,1154,you haev a car or car rental?  maybe join me for a night or swordfishing around Boca... about a 3 hour drive
9520,setomonkey,2006-12-07 19:02:00,872,"Hey ch, yeah we'll be renting a car, but the plan is lay low and take it easy.  Too bad Boca's 3 hrs away, would be fun to try something new fishing in FL.  Mike"
