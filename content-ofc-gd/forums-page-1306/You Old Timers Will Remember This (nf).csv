These great questions and answers are from the days when ""Hollywood Squares"" game show responses were spontaneous and clever, not scripted and (often) dull, as they are now. Peter Marshall was the host asking the questions, of course.  Q. Do female frogs croak? A. Paul Lynde: If you hold their little heads under water long enough.  Q. If you're going to make a parachute jump, at least how high should you be? A. Charley Weaver: Three days of steady drinking should do it.  Q. True or False, a pea can last as long as 5,000 years. A. George Gobel: Boy, it sure seems that way sometimes   Q. You've been having trouble going to sleep. Are you probably a man or a woman? A. Don Knotts: That's what's been keeping me awake.  Q. According to Cosmopolitan, if you meet a stranger at a party and you think that he is attractive, is it okay to come out and ask him if he's married? A. Rose Marie: No; wait until morning.  Q. Which of your five senses tends to diminish as you get older? A. Charley Weaver: My sense of decency.  Q. What are ""Do It,"" ""I can help,"" and ""I can't get enough""? A. George Gobel: I don't know, but it's coming from the next apartment.  Q. As you grow older, do you tend to gesture more or less with your hands while talking? A. Rose Marie: You ask me one more growing old question Peter, and I'll give you a gesture you'll never forget.  Q. Peter, why do Hell's Angels wear leather? A. Paul Lynde: Because chiffon wrinkles too easily.  Q. Charley, you've just decided to grow strawberries. Are you going to get any during the first year? A. Charley Weaver: Of course not, I'm too busy growing strawberries.  Q. In bowling, what's a perfect score? A. Rose Marie: Ralph, the pin boy.  Q. It is considered in bad taste to discuss two subjects at nudist camps. One is politics, what is the other? A. Paul Lynde: Tape measures.  Q. Can boys join the Camp Fire Girls? A. Marty Allen: Only after lights out.  Q. When you pat a dog on its head, he will wag his tail. What will a goose do? A. Paul Lynde: Make him bark?  Q. If you were pregnant for two years, what would you give birth to? A. Paul Lynde: Whatever it is, it would never be afraid of the dark.  Q. It is the most abused and neglected part of your body, what is it? A. Paul Lynde: Mine may be abused, but it certainly isn't neglected.  Q. Back in the old days, when Great Grandpa put horseradish on his head, what was he trying to do? A. George Gobel: Get it in his mouth.  Q. When a couple have a baby, who is responsible for its sex? A. Charley Weaver: I'll lend him the car, the rest is up to him.  Q. Jackie Gleason recently revealed that he firmly believes in them and has actually seen them on at least two occasions. What are they? A. Charley Weaver: His feet.  Q. According to Ann Landers, what are two things you should never do in bed? A. Paul Lynde: Point and laugh."

9428,Terry,2006-12-07 13:07:00,14456,it was always entertaining... but they were given the questions well before the show and they or their writers would write the reply and it would be well practiced before it was shot  doesn't make it less funny but.....I think it makes the people less funny
