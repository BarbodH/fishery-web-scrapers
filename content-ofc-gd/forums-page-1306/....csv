9778,OhioFisherman,2006-12-08 14:40:00,6623,"I must have missed that post Glen, sorry to hear it. I lost one this spring, it`s tough.  Hope yours will be OK!"
9797,Squid,2006-12-08 15:53:00,1656,Good to hear that the pup is on the mend Glen.
9802,specktacklure,2006-12-08 16:01:00,56,I have a 9yr old boxer same kinda story .He was hit when he was around a 1yr old.Driver didn't stop as well .The vet said we would have to amputate his leg because of his fractured elbow but 8yrs later he walks with a bit of a limp but he still has the old leg and he is just fine.Good on you for spending the money to rehab ( i know it's not cheap ) and you will be surprised how well he recovers and gets along.good luck
10056,GbayGiant,2006-12-09 07:11:00,1780,"I have a cat that got hit by a jeep at 1 year old and ended up with a paralyzed left front leg, we decided to leave in on and she has benefitted from it ever since she uses it as a crutch and still climbs trees and gets mice at 15 years old. It might be different for a dog but I would give it as much time as you can before deciding to amputate because he might do better with the leg.  I hope I'm not the only guy that watches the Oprah show  but has anyone seen the dog missing both his front legs that walks like a person ? anyway that dog looks like the happiest dog alive, I think it's tail moves so fast that it levatates. I hope your dog pulls through, lives a happy life and inspires people to try harder."

9129,walleyejigger,2006-12-06 23:29:00,876,"glad she's coming home, you don't know how much you miss them until they're not there,"
9131,steve_paul,2006-12-06 23:36:00,658,"GCD, very happy to hear the pup is going to make it.  Amazing how resilient they are too.  I am sure she will adapt well to the amputation and be as spunky as ever."
9133,ChrisK,2006-12-06 23:44:00,2772,"Glen, Good to here your pup is coming home ....They are real troopers when it comes to adapting to new circumstances......"
9168,Daplumma,2006-12-07 00:36:00,1961,"Good news bud,you already know how I feel about his. Joe"
9171,motv8tr,2006-12-07 00:38:00,2587,"Glen, I'm so happy to hear your pup will be coming home.  If amputation is the best way to go, then your pup will adapt. I have seen much older dogs bounce back and be very active.  Make no mistake, she'll still do all the crazy puppy stuff and out run ya  , and of course you and your wife will love and spoil her even more  Maureen"
9177,camillj,2006-12-07 00:45:00,1988,"Thats good news ... one day at a time my friend ! One of my favourite dogs is a three legged doberman who stands guard at a friends house in barbados ... named aptly ""tripod"""
9184,ccmtcanada,2006-12-07 00:51:00,7971,"Wow...we know what you mean....we recently went through some scary moments with our little guy.  Glad to hear he's gonna make it, even though he has a way to go before full recovery.  Best of luck!"
9235,bpsbassman,2006-12-07 01:46:00,941,Never saw the original post GCD. Glad to hear that things are progressing in the right direction. Keep us posted on the progress.
9237,Garyv,2006-12-07 01:47:00,547,"Hope the leg does get better, but if not here is a short story on another dog that I know.  The vet I take Amy to 12 years ago took in a lab that was hit by a car.  In the end the dogs rear legs were paralized.  She  made one of those mobility walkers for the rear quarters and kept the dog as a vet office mascot.  Still there today at 12 and enjoying it's life."
9392,lew,2006-12-07 09:34:00,12767,"Good to hear the little guy is gonna make it Glen, and I've been waiting for this report since your original post.  Hopefully the leg will be OK, but if not, like others say, he should be able to adapt and still enjoy himself. Be sure to keep us informed as to how he's making out.  Tell him Marvin sends his best wished too"

9495,1leggedangler,2006-12-07 17:08:00,364,"Missed the original post also. So sorry to hear about the puppy and the jerk that didn't have the decency to even stop. Hope everything works out for the best Glen and you would be surprised how quickly puppies can adapt to new challanges. A lot of other people would have given up on the little fella(the vet bills aint cheap) so good on you and wife for rehabbing the pup. All the best!  Cheers, 1leg"

9585,Eddyk,2006-12-07 22:13:00,195,A few years ago I used to see  a little dog with no hind legs. His owner had a little wagon that the pup put his bum in and used his front legs to take him where ever he wanted without a care in the world.
9607,MuskyBill,2006-12-08 00:18:00,311,"Wow, I missed the original post too, Glenner....BUT, I'm glad I caught this one, & even happier to hear you're all doing better!  Hang in there, man...."
9624,douG,2006-12-08 01:16:00,2693,"Errrrr,       So, this heavily armed limping dog walks into a bar.  He surveys the patrons, then shouts, ""Alright.  Which one of you idiots is the one that ran over my Paw""."
