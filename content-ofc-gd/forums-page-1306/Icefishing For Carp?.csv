9598,wishn4fishn,2006-12-07 23:12:00,108,Last season one of my first ever ice escapades for perching.  My friend snagged a carp and we thought it was a monster pike/perch.  I'm uncertain they're willingly to bite in winter.
9600,Rich,2006-12-07 23:50:00,3927,"They will be very difficult to locate and even more difficult to make bite in the winter time.  That being said, I did successfully catch two last year through the ice in about a 5 hour period on a pond.  My best advice is drill three holes in a triangle and chisel out the middle, use lots of chum and stay back from the hole as they are very spooky."
