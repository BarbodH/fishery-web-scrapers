8934,Deano,2006-12-06 16:15:00,767,"Hi all, finally had time to sign up. Just bought a jiffy ice auger from CT, are they any good, anyone have any good or bad opinions on them. I can still bring it back if need be. Any imput would be helpful."
8939,Terry,2006-12-06 16:23:00,14456,"well I have had mine 20 plus years I throw it in the corner I never drain the gas I have never changed the plug and some how that thing just keeps going and going and going....  so I have had my moneys worth out of it 10 x over.....   I have heard great things about strikemaster or whatever it is called, but I will reserve Judgment on them till someone I know has  abused it for 20 years"
8940,lew,2006-12-06 16:24:00,12767,Was wondering where you got to Deano and it's good to see you finally found us.
8943,Deano,2006-12-06 16:29:00,767,"That's good to here Terry, maybe i'll open up the box now. LOL Lew, got heavily into ATV""ing and Geocaching this summer, sold my camp, and only used my boat about 6 times. Just got signed up and hoping to do some hardwater fishing to make winter go by a little faster."
8946,cplummer,2006-12-06 16:34:00,165,they are the best in the business...
8951,Fisherman,2006-12-06 16:43:00,7201,"Jiffy #30, excellent, drilled more holes than a mad pack of termites in balsa."
8952,Garyv,2006-12-06 16:45:00,547,"I'm satisfied with mine, and so are my friends that used to hand drill holes when we went out!"
8953,Deano,2006-12-06 16:45:00,767,"that's what it is, #30 with 10 inch blade. Right now on sale for $439. $110 dollars off"
8967,douG,2006-12-06 17:14:00,2693,"Attaboy, Deano.  When we going ice fishing?"
8973,Pete Maina,2006-12-06 17:35:00,213,"They're awesome. I'd agree with the ""best in the business"" comment. Mine will be fired up here soon.  Pete"
8981,Joey,2006-12-06 18:01:00,9122,"We have had our Jiffy for about 7 years now and have never had a problem with it.  We're the same as terry, never drain the gas or oil and she fires up every year.  Joey"
8987,tjsa,2006-12-06 18:10:00,1578,"I have owned two, a model 30 with a 10 inch bit which I bought some 20 or so years ago, sold that to a bud 5 yrs. ago because we just did not need a 10 inch really, and all it needed was a slight tune-up which I had never ever had done to it. I then bought the Jiffy Lightning 8 inch from CTC, and use and abuse it regularly. I do always drain the gas in the spring, and fog the engine, replace the plug, spray the exterior of the drill with WD-40, and wipe the powerhead with an oil soaked rag, put it in its box that my bud built for me, but thats it. Takes very little time to do that in the spring, about a half hour at best. First ice fishing trip, fill with gas, full choke, pull 3 times at most, and let it warm up on ilde for 1 minute, then drill like crazy.  Have heard the blade styles of the strikemaster cut better than the jiffy, but have never actually tried one myself to know for sure."
9046,Moosebunk,2006-12-06 20:12:00,3970,"TJ, I've used a new Strikemaster and it was quicker than my Jiffy I'd say.  Last year used a Husqavarna too.  Thing was quiet, sleek, but after about 20 holes after just being taken out of the box, the guy bent the auger shaft on the thing.  Not understanding this he kept drilling and burned the thing right out.  It was insane.  I like my 10"" Jiffy.  I hope to sometime find someone whos motor has gone and I can pick up the 6-8 or 9 auger extension and add that to my collection.  Had to buy the 10 last year for pulling up big pike and bending them into the holes in 1 foot depths."
9175,Carp,2006-12-07 00:44:00,1488,"We have a Jiffy 10"" and it's been going strong for about 20 years. Don't think we ever did anything to it except spray some cleaner around the throttle mechanism when it got a bit sticky."
9370,allstar,2006-12-07 05:09:00,3,good good good
9478,gaffer,2006-12-07 15:09:00,12,"Ya Jiffly makes a nice product, never had a problem.....knock on wood"
9500,Deano,2006-12-07 17:36:00,767,"Thanks Guys, I'm gonna have to fire her up when(as soon) I get a chance. Sounds like I made a good investment. Now hopefully I can get out and catch some fish. Bring on the hard water."
9565,irishfield,2006-12-07 21:26:00,26272,"Noticed that the 9"" is also a $100 off for $399 in CTC. One on the shelf in the Bayfield St CTC in Barrie for sure... as of 3pm this afternoon. Not sure what I was doing in the fishing isle looking for Christmas stuff for Leah..but I was ! lol"
9628,Rizzo,2006-12-08 01:17:00,4754,"I've got an Eskimo ""Barracuda"".  Went to a meet and greet with my buddy Lurch (may he rest in peace) a few years back with some Fishontario guys.  Brutally cold out on Miner's Bay.  My auger would not run in the -30 temps.  Who came to the rescue but somebody with a jiffy.  For style points a like my barracuda, but to do it all over again the jiffy seems more reliable.  Mi auger wouldn't start until the sun came over the horizon and heated it up a bit."
9653,Blake,2006-12-08 02:06:00,418,You will love it.  My friend had his for over 15 years and is an ice fishing fanatic who is out as often he can and drills alot of holes. He finally bought a new one just because.  The old one is still going strong from the person that bought it.
9681,fishindevil,2006-12-08 03:12:00,6254,"yes i have the #30 and she works great ive had it for about 13yrs and all ive ever done was change a plug and a little tune-up and she is ready it also is a 10"" blade the only downfall is its a little on the heavy side if you have to carry it by hand for a ways,but its a long lasting unit and should drill you several million holes before you die,or pass her on to the next generation...lol...lol"
