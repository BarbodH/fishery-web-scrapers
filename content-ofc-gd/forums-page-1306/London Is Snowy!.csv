9823,Rich,2006-12-08 17:01:00,3927,Bust out the snowmobile!
9935,trapshooter,2006-12-08 23:11:00,1234,my folks live 10k outside of the city of London Limits and they got none of that snow.  It was a really localized streamer.  Nuts.
9937,ShaunB,2006-12-08 23:15:00,73,Yeah I have family in Kitchener and they didn't get anything.  How long are we going to have to wait in the Toronto area to get a nice blanket of snow on the ground?  It is starting to seem like we are never going to get it.  Mother natures keeps teasing us.  We had the cold weather this week and now it looks as though things are gonna warm up a bit for next.  I wonder when we are going to be able to get out on the ice.  The sudbury guys are already saying they may be out by the weekend.
9940,Woodsman,2006-12-08 23:25:00,1286,I live about 15 mins. NE of London Airport. We got about 1/2 or slightly less snow than reported in London. As it was light fluffy snow I was able to drive through it to go to work in Stratford today. If it would have been wet heavey snow I would have not even considered trying it.  Best Wishes: Rick
