8858,hawkeye,2006-12-06 13:17:00,162,you're assuming that there will be hard water on Cooks by then. This morning in Keswick it was +1 and the long range forecast ain't all that good

I've never been, but I hear the bass fishing is amazing, and there's some good offshore stuff too if you're into that sort of thing...  Mike"
