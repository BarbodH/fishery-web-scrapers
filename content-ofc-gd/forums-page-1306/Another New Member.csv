9104,setomonkey,2006-12-06 22:43:00,872,"welcome to the board.  Don't know Simcoe very well, but there are lots of good lodges on Nipissing. If you haven't already noticed there are lots of fans of Lakair Lodge (West Arm) here.  I stayed at Memquisit Lodge last year and would recommend it, just under the highway bridge from Lakair & Samoset.  Mike"
