9631,outdoorguy61,2006-12-08 01:23:00,220,Espanola through to Thunder Bay as my ideal. The reality (for me) is sadly quite different....lol.  outdoorguy61
9696,troutologist,2006-12-08 04:01:00,951,Grab a stocking list from the MNR and look for a lake that is stocked frequently in the last few years...smaller fish but more. Also the further you're willing to walk the better chance you'll have. tough to get the name of a speck lake outta most folks
9698,iceguy,2006-12-08 04:07:00,341,"North of the Elliot lake area, is a good start. Get the stocking list from that area, The further you go the better, use minnows, run and gun and always fish the last hour."

9910,Bob,2006-12-08 22:12:00,370,"Tons of trout lakes in the area both north and south of town.  East and west too. Heh!  If you're thinking of travelling this far, get in touch and I'll try to find out which lakes are producing best.  I've always found morning best for specks up until about 11 AM, after that, you can get lakers and many of these lakes have both."
