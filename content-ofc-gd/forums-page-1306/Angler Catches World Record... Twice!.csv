8520,Headhunter,2006-12-05 17:10:00,5703,"Here's a link to a story outta the U.K. about a carp angler who caught the same fish, twice, a year apart and re-setting his own record! http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006560230,00.html (I'm technically challenged, so just copy the link... enjoy!) HH"
8526,irishfield,2006-12-05 17:15:00,26272,Link works ...   ...and BTW..book delivered fella.
8528,Headhunter,2006-12-05 17:27:00,5703,Thanks so much I.F! Much appreciated! I guess I'm not as inept as I thought! HH
8529,ccmtcanada,2006-12-05 17:27:00,7971,"It was a pretty bad article with very little detail, but it looks like there will be a video of the new record released tomorrow sometime.

8535,Spiel,2006-12-05 17:42:00,9065,"....Yep, saw a picture of it earlier this morning....  "
8546,snag,2006-12-05 18:07:00,1932, Good god!  What's wrong with it?  Looks like an alien is about to pop out.  Locals should lay off the donuts for bait idea.
8554,mattyk,2006-12-05 18:46:00,2110,Thats one serious pig!
8694,fishindevil,2006-12-06 00:22:00,6254,"HOLY, thats a huge carp,   its a wonder it can even swim........"
8699,GbayGiant,2006-12-06 00:47:00,1780,Looks like it's been sitting on the same couch he caught it on last year.
8700,Rizzo,2006-12-06 00:52:00,4754,I think when buddy caught it a year ago he plugged its butt.  That thing looks real bunged up
8724,mepps,2006-12-06 01:54:00,1301,"Well, next year when he catches it it should be over 90lbs, and the year after, over 100!"
8728,Gerritt,2006-12-06 02:00:00,6129,I wonder if carp is any good in the smoker..... and would it fit? Hmmmmm modifications will be needed I think.  Gerritt.
8893,crappieperchhunter,2006-12-06 14:52:00,2582,"LOL Gerrit. That would have to be the mother of all smokers.  I would go another route. As BBR would say ""Chowda""...you could make gallons of it.  This second catch really doesn't surprise me however. I just finished my 2nd full season of Carpin and have a ""swim"" in Bobcaygeon I bait regularly. I have caught this one carp with a good scar on it at least 5 times....stupid fish...over the last 2 summers."
9341,setomonkey,2006-12-07 03:38:00,872,"That thing is grotesque, not b/c it's a carp, but b/c it's freakishly huge.  Mike"
9364,Squid,2006-12-07 04:18:00,1656, That is probably so true Gbay    It probably never moved from  the spot that it was    caught the first time
9394,Carp,2006-12-07 09:58:00,1488,"  I'm good at a lot of things, but I don't smoke dude.  As for fitting in. Well, I have to admit, it wouldn't be a bad thing if I shed a few pounds."
