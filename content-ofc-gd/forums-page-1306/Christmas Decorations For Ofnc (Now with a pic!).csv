9084,Bly,2006-12-06 22:03:00,1556,Absolutely wonderful and not overly Christmas for all the scrooges/grinches on here!!  blyght
9111,walleyejigger,2006-12-06 22:59:00,876,"looks good, warm and inviting"
9415,Bob,2006-12-07 12:11:00,370,Looks good to me and I had my cataracts fixed.
9432,bpsbassman,2006-12-07 13:28:00,941,When does it arrive??
9434,Roy,2006-12-07 13:33:00,13728,"I like it. I find that it's easier to read than the standard one even. Great layout.  Roger, bottom left of this page there is a drop box with different skins...just click on the Christmas one."
9436,ccmtcanada,2006-12-07 13:34:00,7971, Must only be available to mods/admins....I only have one skin choice still.
9441,lew,2006-12-07 13:41:00,12767,"Roy, that drop box existed for a short time after this new board started, then it disappeard a couple weeks back, but I think Rick said we'd be getting something in the near future for changing the skins.  Myself, I'd prefer something other than the driftwood that we currently have, but perhaps that's just me. I think a white background would be preferable to those of us with ""older"" eyes"
9474,bigfish1965,2006-12-07 15:00:00,3382,"We will be having an assortment of skins. Some designed for looks, some for speed. The thing is I have to do manual edits to each for the links, ad codes and the spell check."
8485,bigfish1965,2006-12-05 15:46:00,3382,"Maybe a tree and some nice Christmas lights. Stay tuned! Was thinking of using the falling snow trick, but that would likely be over the top."
8494,motv8tr,2006-12-05 16:09:00,2587,"Ya Rick, a snow fall would be over the top...all I need to do is look out the window to see snow , and that's more than I want  Maureen"
8496,Bly,2006-12-05 16:14:00,1556,"Over the top??   Hmmm, Don't think I have ever seen a Christmas decoration that was over the top     But then again, every hanging picture in my house is wrapped to look like a present and so are all the kitchen cupboards!  Go for it Rick!!"
8497,John,2006-12-05 16:16:00,2956,Maybe santa hats for everyone?
8506,irishfield,2006-12-05 16:42:00,26272,Bah humbug !  ..anyone wanna do my shoppin?
8507,misfish,2006-12-05 16:44:00,29133,"  Sure thing Wayne.I,ll be by to pick up the credit cards."
8508,John,2006-12-05 16:45:00,2956,"Wayne, you've done enough shopping for one year......."
8510,irishfield,2006-12-05 16:49:00,26272, Probably true...I did get her a captains chair for her side..think that will do?
8512,John,2006-12-05 16:52:00,2956,Air-ride?
8515,Terry,2006-12-05 17:00:00,14456,maybe we can have some of that xmas music playing in the background too or better yet  lets keep things the way they are
8518,Whopper,2006-12-05 17:08:00,2174, Nope  I'm in the same shape Wayne only beside xmas she has a big birthday tomorrow and I ain't got squat  Whopper
8521,irishfield,2006-12-05 17:11:00,26272, Yep with slider even...am I good to go?   ...oh and Rick...what Terry said ! Thanks anyhow....
8522,lew,2006-12-05 17:11:00,12767,"Rick, will we get presents along with the decorations too ??"
8525,bigfish1965,2006-12-05 17:14:00,3382,Music? No..embedded music is a total sin in the web designers handbook. Keep things the same? Also a sin. Everyone likes options.
8530,Terry,2006-12-05 17:29:00,14456,"well good make it a skin, so we can see it if we like or have things just the way it is for us scrooges"
8531,Raf,2006-12-05 17:31:00,3495,Scrooge here.  I'd like to see a no-frills version with a little less bells and whistles.
8532,Headhunter,2006-12-05 17:33:00,5703,"Maybe we should bring back Dano's ""Charlotte"" and put bells on her as she does her Xmas wiggle! That would get my Xmas spirit going!!! HH"
8544,pameladallaire,2006-12-05 18:02:00,470,"Hey, my brother-in-law has a santa hat ball cap.  Maybe we could have OFC santa caps."
8573,TJQ,2006-12-05 19:42:00,7806,Ive seen the skin.. its really nice.. we should leave it on...
8591,John,2006-12-05 20:18:00,2956, Only if it vibrates when you inset a quarter........
8790,ccmtcanada,2006-12-06 03:40:00,7971,I figure Christmas comes once a year...I can live with some holiday cheer on here....my wife went crazy with about 4000 lights in the house anyways...what's a few hundred more on this site??
8808,bigfish1965,2006-12-06 05:26:00,3382,Here's a sneak peek. It really doesn't do it justice. The detail is absolutely incredible. I wish I had half the talent this fine young Aussie lass designer of ours does! 
8810,Joey,2006-12-06 05:32:00,9122,Looks good Rick.  Looks like you put some thought  into that  Joey
8839,ccmtcanada,2006-12-06 12:11:00,7971,You know what?  It looks great Rick!!  Bring it on!
9083,Garyv,2006-12-06 21:58:00,547,"Looks good to me...but get other opinions , I have cataracts!"
