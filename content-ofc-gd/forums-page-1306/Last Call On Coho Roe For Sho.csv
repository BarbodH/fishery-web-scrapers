""You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, you get what you need""-some song which spills wisdom like a faucet.  Anywhoz we kept practicing our casts all morning with no takers on massive dime, nickel and quarter size bags.  Even brown roe wasn't getting a sniff.  Unusual moment took place when some old skooler caught a bow and mentioned that he released it.   When wading across the river we stumbled on his stringer with the specimen still attached.  Stringer release?!?!?  Perhaps.  Stomach acid release?!?!?! Undoubtably.  Delusional?? Most definetly.  Nice weather for mid week fishing, seen 2 fish landed.  Overall a semi splendid day.  Here's the documentation   Workstation and Fruits from our efforts "

9222,fishindevil,2006-12-07 01:33:00,6254,so it looks like he just gutted the fish  and then tossed her back in the creek  hes lucky there was no ministry around....   but glad you hit a few fish
9224,FishFinder,2006-12-07 01:37:00,481,"I have not once seen a MNR officer at this trib, nor any other of that matter"
9226,ccmtcanada,2006-12-07 01:40:00,7971, I believe that is what he's talking about.   edit:   Oh sure fishfinder...edit your post so I look like an idiot....

I've been checked several times in the past couple of years, but I had never seen a CO the first few years I fished.  One of those times was on the Credit; I was glad to see him. He was working his way down and checking every angler for license etc.  Mike"
