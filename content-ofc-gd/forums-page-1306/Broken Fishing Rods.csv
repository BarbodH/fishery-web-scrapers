10028,Tdel,2006-12-09 04:50:00,393,"I broke 2 rods.  I went on a long weekend fishing trip to the French river and got the lure hooked up in a tree.  Snapped the end off trying to free the lure.  When I arrived home I went out and bought another rod and went fishing that evening. Before I could get to the water the tip of the rod tried to wrap itself around a small tree branch and snapped off.   So that shows you how good a fisherman I am, both rods broken by trees and me.  That was many, many moons ago.   Nothing since I bought my Ugly Stick.  My brother tried to break it by closing the car trunk on it once but couldn't do much except bend the eye.  I straightened it out and all was well.  Tom"
9824,bigbuck,2006-12-08 17:04:00,2449,"I've broken 6 rods in 30 years of fishing (2 tips on the Muskoka river on snags, 1 Berkley had the handle crack, and 3 this year (I should change my handle to Snagglepuss), my St Croix Muskie rod on a snag up on LOTW this past summer, my St Croix bass rod on the Muskoka river by the falls in Bracebridge (a snag) and my replacement St Croix Muskie rod on Lake Muskoka on a snag going for big pike. All were bought at JB's and all were replaced no questions asked. Those guys are great for service. Hopefully, next year I'll be a teeny weeny bit more careful and won't break anything (just cut the line and move on)."

10020,Cookslav,2006-12-09 04:14:00,1457,"LOL Big Swede...  I've broken 2 in my life.... 2 years ago and they were with in 10 minutes of each other.  While Fishing some heavy reeds I got stuck....it was about 4 feet from the boat side, and I was useing 30lb PP so I leaned on the rod a bit to swing the boat over a bit closer to pull the reed out.(somthing I had done 1000's of times before) and the rod snapped at the base?  I was heartbroken...I loved that rod. I had used it for the last 6-7years, and had a lotta good times with it...some big fish to boot.  So anyway... Big Swede being the swell guy he is lent me his Spare. Well wouldn't you know it I got stuck on a reed again, and leaned on the rod a bit to feel out how solid the Snag was, and snap!!!  All hear behind me is Big Swede gasping ""Guy....did you just break my rod""  LOL.... That was the 2nd time and hopfully the last. I bought him a new rod and we're Freinds again"
