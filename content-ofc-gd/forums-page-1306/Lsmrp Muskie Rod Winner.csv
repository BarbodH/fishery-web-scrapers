9371,Ron,2006-12-07 05:11:00,1683,"Well, firstly I would like to thank everyone who generously donated towards a great project. Thinking of having an oportunity to fish for Muskie on Lake Simcoe in another 8 yrs sounds intriging. There are still a lot of learning curves to overcome in raising a wild Muskie, but every year will be better.  The effort put forward on your donations, raised another $555.00. This is a great start in what will be an ongoing project.  Congratulations Joey on winning the St. Croix Rod, I am sure you will enjoy years of use and abuse from it.  Once again, thanks to all who donated."
