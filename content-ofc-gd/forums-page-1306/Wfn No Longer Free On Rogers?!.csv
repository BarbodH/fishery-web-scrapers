8721,Nemo,2006-12-06 01:47:00,727,Just sat down and tried to switch on WFN (426). It is no longer free on Rogers.  A message comes up telling me to order.  It was good while it lasted.  Don't think i'll order it though.
8726,bigfish1965,2006-12-06 01:55:00,3382,AT least you had the free preview..Cogeco here never did. Still doesn't.
8727,irishfield,2006-12-06 01:57:00,26272,Xpressview goes till Jan 31st I believe...
8761,FishHeadRic,2006-12-06 03:01:00,226,I'm still getting it for free and I'm on rogers.  FHR
8765,salmon,2006-12-06 03:07:00,334,FHR I'm telling LOL Turned it on this evening and no WFN. Called to order it and they also gave me 5 channels free for 3 months. Gives me something to do in the winter.... Jose
8766,Nemo,2006-12-06 03:09:00,727,Hey Salmon what do they charge and what other channels did you get?
8786,Gerritt,2006-12-06 03:31:00,6129,this is why I HATE the cable companies and Rogers is by far THE WORST GOING... Get a Pansat and be done with it!    Gerritt
8811,Joey,2006-12-06 05:36:00,9122,"It's like $2 per month for it on Rogers.  I pay more for coffee in a day.  Go on, live a little and splurge for it.  If  you have a package you can add it and take out one of the channels you don't watch too much.  Joey"
8816,verno,2006-12-06 06:15:00,178,"I switched to bell to get the WFN and WildTv too.  Love them both, when its over im subscibing for sure."
8838,Crazyhook,2006-12-06 12:08:00,1154,its worth the 2 bucks IMO
8842,ccmtcanada,2006-12-06 12:23:00,7971,Not working for me either (Rogers customer).  But I'm going to swap out the Game Show Channel for it....
8914,Seahag,2006-12-06 15:43:00,19,I have cogeco and i had it free for about a month or so.  I checked in on it  everyday and haven't got around to ordering it.  I have pirated express view which doesn't get it and now my cogeco doesn't get it.  Any idea what it costs a month.  Maybe i just have to change my free lifestyle package. right now i have leafs tv and sports but i get all that for free on the dish.  hmmmm  i guess i'll look into it.
9095,JEREMY,2006-12-06 22:28:00,300,I have it on rogers and would rather get rid of my wife than channel that has fishing 24/7.
9103,fishchaser,2006-12-06 22:41:00,17,"I'm on Rogers and some of you guys are lucky, even though I would like to pay for WFN, it's not available in my area  fishchaser"
9703,John Bacon,2006-12-08 04:44:00,3277,  Why would this be a reason to hate cable companies?  Is it because they don't include all stations for one standard price instead of providing a choice of getting a few channels for a lower price or lots of channels for a higher price?  They provided a free preview of a specialty channel; why would that make you hate them?
