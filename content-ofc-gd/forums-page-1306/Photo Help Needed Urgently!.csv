9953,Gerritt,2006-12-09 00:22:00,6129,"Moosebunk thank you for your reply... Yes my son has been diagnosed with eczema he is seeing both a Dermatologist and a doctor that specializes in adolescent allergies. My son has been prescribed more creams and  more antibiotics then I can even begin to count... problem is they have little lasting effect..  and he too young for the majority of the drugs available to help him cope.. we all hope he will grow out of this and is just a stage but we have to be prepared that it just might not be temporary..  He also suffers from severe food allergies, Wheat, Eggs, Dairy Products, Soy, Legumes... and all the by products of the above... try and go to your Grocery store and purchase something without the above ingredients... it is difficult.. he carries around Epipen just incase...  He sees a nutritionist to make sure he is growing properly sand getting the nourishment he requires from the foods were are able to feed him. He is doing well in this regard as I am spend a small fortune on specialty foods from specialty shops to cater to his needs. he eats alot of Organic veggies and fruits.. and his protein comes in the form of certified organic Meats etc.. Turkey, Rabbit, Lamb and wild game are all considered less allergic compared to other meats  I never thought I would know as much as I do about foods and nutrition and food ingredients and that stuff you cant pronounce on food labels....but I had no choice but to receive a crash course  and the good thing.... I have lost 20lbs myself by eating better  Just a small synopsis on my little mans experiances in life  Gerritt."
9956,Moosebunk,2006-12-09 00:31:00,3970,"Melaluca (sp) is a newer organic thing being put into some creams coming out of Australia.  It's harmless, like aloe.  Look into it more if you like.  It helped very much with two very pale white kids up here.  Your boy is a cute lad, great Xmas pic."
9611,Gerritt,2006-12-08 00:41:00,6129,ok most of you know about my sons allergies and with them come eczema as well as asthma... we took a bunch of shots for xmas that we would like to send to family... but in them his skin looks way worse then what is normally is...  I need you photo gurus to help me fix it if possible to get rid of the redness     thanks in advance guys...  I can email you the original file 1.65 mb... if you are able to fix it... pm me your email  Gerritt
9612,TennesseeGuy,2006-12-08 00:47:00,957,"Gerritt, your son looks fine to me."
9614,Gerritt,2006-12-08 00:57:00,6129,"TG it is the redness in his face we are trying to resolve...while my son is perfect to us... we would like to have something that looks a little cleaner to send to family, alot of the time his face is potted with scabs and blisters... While we know he what he is... He a vibrant young little man and Stubborn!! like his dad... but some people cant see though his condition and constantly ask questions... and personally we are tired of answering them... especially from the older members of our families   it is something he will/should grow out of...  Gerritt."
9615,wishn4fishn,2006-12-08 00:59:00,108,You should add a bowl of pasta to the photo.

9663,danc,2006-12-08 02:40:00,4677,"Terry's your man here Gerritt. I can make the original photo a little better if I had to but I don't do photo alterations. I'm sure that Terry will fix you up real good when he gets things back together again. In fact, I'm sure that you'll be amazed."
9665,Gerritt,2006-12-08 02:41:00,6129,Guys please dont get me wrong... I love my son more then anything on gods great earth. We deal with his issues daily. We just dont want others to worry any more then they already are.. we are not trying to sugarcoat anything.. just want to make him look like he does when he has his good days..  Here is an example of one of his good days...      They look like two totally different children  but I assure you they are the same... just turns out that his allergies are acting up... so I would like to clean the xmas pics up a bit... and trust me.. when his skin is not bothering him he is delightful..  right now he is a handful lol  thanks for understanding guys... it is hard to see him like this right now.. as there is little we can do for him other then ask to stop trying to scratch his face off...  Gerritt.

9820,1leggedangler,2006-12-08 16:55:00,364,"Gerrit your little guy is just awesome! The talent of some of the board members just amazes me, great job Fishfinder.  Cheers, 1leg"
9874,aplumma,2006-12-08 20:13:00,6896,"Hey Gerrit the term is ""airbrushing"" and is quite common on most of the photos you see in the magazines and other printed media. It is used when skin blemishes appear or even when the light hits a feature wrong and exagerates a shadow or colorment. I have cured a ton of red eye and lightened and darkened photos to make them closer to real life and what a beautiful item or scene can look like.  Happy Holidays  Art"
9938,Gerritt,2006-12-08 23:16:00,6129,Hey guys I would like to thank everyone for their help in getting this put together..  FishFinder & Rick a HUGE thank you.. I have ordered the prints based on your guys work...  I wish you and yours all the best this holiday season.  Gerritt.
9947,Moosebunk,2006-12-08 23:55:00,3970,"Gerritt,  If you're looking to try different remedies for what is ""likely"" a type of dermatitis partly related to your sons developmental stage, but, could be a hereditary or environmental issue here are my thoughts.  Your son is teething I can see.  If he is a thumb sucker, finger biter or blanket in mouth while sleeping drooler, he is keeping moisture to the outside of his face longer than normal, and, because ""babies skin is sensitive"" (like the commercials so truthfully say) he is causing either a contact dermatitis, heat rash, a fungal type of dermatitis very much like diaper rash, or, a combination of all.  Either that, or he has eczema (often hereditary form of dermatitis)  First and easiest medical treatment is.....  Vaseline or any Glaxal based ointment applied sparingly to the face a few times daily.  If no relief see your family doctor and they may possible prescribe creams or ointments with hydrocortisone.  Cortate is a commonly used medication for dermatologic conditions.  It is not an OTC medication so you will likely need a prescription.  Anything med treatments like this and you should always see your doctor first.  I do not know your sons medical history, they should, and they should know what is safe.  Some new things are on the market, other advice can be given, but, I can't get into any trouble with this public and common medical advice posted here.  I don't need my butt sued if things don't work out."
