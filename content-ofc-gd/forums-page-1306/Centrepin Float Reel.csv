9747,luv2drift,2006-12-08 13:24:00,147,This question if for all the centrepinners out there.  I recently came across a centrepin float reel that has no identifiable brand names on it.  It is heavy and brass colour.  I think it might be a stream runner?  Has anyone out there heard of this and if so who sells them.
9844,babaganoush,2006-12-08 18:59:00,105,i believe they stopped making these reels a while ago the first generation stream runners did not have any writing on it   but the stream runner II will have the name printed on the back....great reel  came with a spare spool and spins like a dream but is on the heavy side my stream runner is more of a silver colour than bronze  if you like i could take a pic of my reel and post it up later today
9851,Harv,2006-12-08 19:27:00,19,I have a Stream Runner I and it is written on the back.  I agree it is a good reel just a little on the heavy side.  I will try to attach a picture of mine for you.  HARV

10029,luv2drift,2006-12-09 05:06:00,147,"It looks just like that one Harv posted only there isn't any writing on it....the guy who sold it to me thought he did have a spare spool with it.  ""The guy"" sold it to me as a combo with a g loomis 13foot Gl2 for 150 bucks....But I want to find out if  this is a stream runner??  and it is heavy.  and Harv I think I asked you this question on another board about this reel.  You'll figure it out by the questions even though the names are different."
