Joe
9253,Smokey,2006-12-07 02:02:00,1278,It was Mike (EH) that was looking for the tails. Maybe he can tell you the best way to prep them.
9273,misfish,2006-12-07 02:24:00,29133,"I found it best to turn the tails inside out.I just throw them in a bag of rock salt.Remove for a day.let them air dry outside,then put back in the bag.Repeat til the hide is dried."
9377,Ron,2006-12-07 05:38:00,1683,"The best way I have done is by slicing the skin, the same way as field dressing. Go through the white portion of the hair. Remove bone and if possible, scrape what fat you can out of the skin. Rub a generous amount of Pickling Salt into the skin and this will form a ""hide"". Try to avoid a plastic bag as the moisture won't escape out of the skin. Scraping the fat out of the tail is the most crucial.  Second way is like some the True ""Northerners"" do it. Stretch it on a board. Let it stand in the Sun for a month or 2 and then chew on it to soften it up. You can try it this way but I prefer doing it the first way."
9407,aplumma,2006-12-07 11:40:00,6896,how do you get the deer to stretch out on the board before you chew on his tail????   Joe

9471,TEP,2006-12-07 14:52:00,68,"I'll trade whatever you like outta my hairy box for a bunch of tails. Hoping to make the G2G, if I don't ,someone there will have the goods from me!"
