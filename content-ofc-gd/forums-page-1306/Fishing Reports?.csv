9363,Rich,2006-12-07 04:16:00,3927,"lol, report posted  Oh yeah, I did repair the rod. It's still 6 inches shorter though! haha"
9365,POLLIWOGG,2006-12-07 04:20:00,835,"Just think of it as a little less awkward, still makes a goog lightning rod."

Well last night around 7.30 decided i wanted to go fishing so rich came with me.  Took my dog princess......She was in the back of the van picked up rich he put his rods in the back and as we were driving princess i guess decided she would lay where one of riches rod ends ....lol......Anyway we got there he fixed up his line i grabbed a rod......Could not see a blooming thing.......WAS FISHING THEN I SEE RICH YANKING AT HIS ROD AND FOR Second thought he had a fish...As it happened he had a tree....lmao so he lost everything....I was casting and could not see where the heck my line was going...Anyway i am thinking hummm summit does not feel right , Remember it was pitch black....lol......Shine a light on the end of the rod and everything is all twisted up so we gave it up.....lol......But what the heck atleast i got out for an hr....When ur stuck working all day inside who cares if its dark and cold when u go out fishing...Its just nice to be beside the water and get some fresh air and be able to drop a line in the water.....Day off tommorow  Anyone wanna go fishing?"

9799,ehg,2006-12-08 15:56:00,2666,"I think that April is actually the worst month for fishing, unless your into carp or have a Great Lakes boat for spring salmon. Yup, musky closes province wide Dec. 15th.  cheers,  ehg"
8397,ehg,2006-12-05 04:21:00,2666,"I've never seen so little fishing reports, in the few years i've seen this board, as there is on this first page today. Must be the weather this weekend and the closing of fishing on most lakes around the province. Not to worry though there is more BOQ to go and once ice is on Simcoe there will be many, many perch reports  cheers,  ehg"
8399,snag,2006-12-05 04:32:00,1932,"I'm workin' on it!  Trying for more quality and not quantity. I've been catching fish, just not happy with the sizes......"

8455,nautifish,2006-12-05 13:55:00,1416,Yup the weather has for sure played a big factor in the lesser amounts of fishing reports but i doubt it will be for long......  &^ did i hear someone say PERCH?  MMMMmmm
8478,setomonkey,2006-12-05 15:21:00,872,"I think this is typical of December?  Lots of people have put their boats away, Kawarthas closed, only some never-say-quit anglers still out...  Mike"
8482,ccmtcanada,2006-12-05 15:43:00,7971,"Yeah...reports are hard to come by now.  If someone hooked a minnow on the end of a hook and posted the pic, I'd probably get all excited!!!!"

9332,ccmtcanada,2006-12-07 03:23:00,7971," After what you've been thru lately nautifish, nothing surprises me.  I just hope your boat isn't at the bottom of the lake...."
9344,nautifish,2006-12-07 03:40:00,1416,lmao nope no boat involved thank goodness....But i reckon rich is wishing he had just stayed home now......lmao
