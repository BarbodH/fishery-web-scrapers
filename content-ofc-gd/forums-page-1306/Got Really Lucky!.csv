8995,Chrispy,2006-12-06 18:47:00,168,"On Saturday my cousin came over to help me raise up the boat off it's wheels and put the trailer on jacks....all is going ok, we get it off the ground and one of my tires is hanging reel low....I take a look under it and the axle is broken off of the trailer!!!!!  I couldn't believe it!!!  It must have happened when I trailered the boat up north and back (over 2000 KM there and back)....we have to travel some pretty crappy dirt roads to get to the cottage.....I checked the other site and it has a crack in it also....I can't believe how lucky I am that the wheel didn't come off on the highway!!!  Again I am lucky, my cousin works for a construction company and he has a portable weilder that he can throw in his truck and come over and fix it for me at no cost to me.....  When I sit and think about it if the boat would have flew off on the highway I could have killed somebody!!!!!  Please everyone check your trailers a few times a year....I know I will be from now on!!  Chrispy!"
9013,ccmtcanada,2006-12-06 19:16:00,7971,Wow...scary to think of what could have been!!!!  Glad you're getting it all fixed up.
9015,Smokey,2006-12-06 19:21:00,1278,"Your right, you did get lucky. I make a habit of doing a walk around and a look under anything I trailer at every fill up. A habit I got into years ago when my Dad and I used to tow for people. You never know what you'll find and fix along the way.  Lesson learned I guess, glad to hear it wll worked out in the end."
9016,Bly,2006-12-06 19:21:00,1556,Really does put things in perspective when something like this happens......I remember years and years ago making a 1.5 hour trip and finding out when I got home that I had been driving with a broken control arm.  Great to hear that everything is going to be taken care of!!  blyght  Time to buy a lottery ticket!!  hehe
9041,Chrispy,2006-12-06 20:14:00,168,"This is my first year with the boat so I had no idea about checking something like that....I always made sure my lights work, my tires are filled, my bearings are good and greased, etc.....never a thought about looking under.....your right one lesson learned!!!!  Off to buy my loto ticket now!!!  LOL!!!!   Chrispy!  I also meant to say that the break would have been hard to see unless you got down right under the frame of the trailer and looked hard.....it still looked like it was attached until you lifted the tires off the ground.....I am going to check it a few times a year by jacking up the trailers wheels off the ground....   Chrispy!"
9268,camillj,2006-12-07 02:18:00,1988,I'm thinkin instead of buying a lottory ticket maybe a small donation to a charity ... as a thank you for blessings already received might be appropriate (ya dodged a bullet there)
9390,Sinker,2006-12-07 07:30:00,8692,"Hard to see usually......most times they crack right  where the axle sits on the springs.......if the axle is on top of the springs.....  Good thing to watch for, that's for sure. Live and learn!  Sinker"
9460,Chrispy,2006-12-07 14:28:00,168,That's exactly right Sinker....that is how it is....very hard to see!!!!  I just hope this post will remind everyone next spring to take a really close look at their trailer....I've learned an important lesson from this and I hope it helps someone else as well!!!!    Chrispy!
9494,Chris,2006-12-07 16:47:00,405,"Wow, that coulda been a catastrophe.   Best time to check is after you launch your boat and park. Makes it a lot easier to check it all over."
9505,Entropy,2006-12-07 17:49:00,747,You did get lucky... when did you pick the boat up?
9526,Chrispy,2006-12-07 19:26:00,168,"Entropy, I got the boat just over a year ago....I did the same last year when I put her away so I know I did it somehow....  ChrisS, that is a perfect time to check.....When I first started backing up the trailer without the boat I used to have to pick it up and move it by hand because I sucked at backing up...LOL!!!  So I know that would work!!!  LMAO!!   Chrispy!"
