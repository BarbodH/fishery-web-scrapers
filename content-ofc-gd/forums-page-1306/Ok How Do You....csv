8899,lew,2006-12-06 15:02:00,12767," OK, I'll bite, where's the delete button ??.......Jeeez, maybe I really DO need glasses"
8900,Terry,2006-12-06 15:03:00,14456,I think you go to edit then you will find the tools
8904,Raf,2006-12-06 15:09:00,3495,No delete is not available to us mere members.  Prolly an admin/mod only function.
8917,Whopper,2006-12-06 15:44:00,2174,Correct me if I'm wrong but as a member I think all you can do is edit a post and if you are the one that started the thread you can only edit your text and not your Topic Title.  Whopper
9312,bigfish1965,2006-12-07 03:03:00,3382,"You can edit your topic title too by using the ""Full edit' feature rather than Quick Edit. Deleting of posts was removed after some where taking advantage by stirring up crap then deleting the evidence."
9316,Rizzo,2006-12-07 03:08:00,4754, people would do that on the internet? Frankly I'm shocked and appalled
9406,Whopper,2006-12-07 11:37:00,2174," Rick The full edit button does not let me change Topic Title on a thread that I started, matbe I broke it  Whopper"
