651630,Rod Caster,2011-12-29 17:45:00,5784," X2. When I'm in a canoe on a lake that gets three visitors a year, I'll take my chances and bring a few ""pops"". I guess in a canoe/paddleboat, both people are considered ""operator""."
651632,cram,2011-12-29 17:47:00,1733,"I assume having an open beer on my dock is considered drinking in public?  Or, sitting in my boat while tied to the dock after 3-4 beers risks a DUI."
651639,lew,2011-12-29 18:13:00,12766," There was a time Bill when that wasn't such a big deal as long as everyone was behaving themselves.  Probably 25 years ago myself & 2 buds were heading out for a day of fishing in the Kawarthas in my boat and we had a cooler with samiches and 6 beer when we got stopped by the police boat. They asked for all the usual safety gear and when he was satisfied with that he asked me what I had in the cooler.  I told him straight up about the beer and his answer was ""thank you gentlemen and have a good day of fishing""  Everyone was sober and behaving themselves and he could see that.  Wouldn't want to try that today though."
651651,corvette1,2011-12-29 19:26:00,1765,"if you are the owner of the boat you are also the capt even if you did not drink you take the hit they can take your boat, trailer, truck and all your gear and beer is buy the can 125.00 each i know for a fact. i have been checked in nakia and timmins they do check in remote places. when you see that boat or plane coming at you your all but caught"
651658,LeXXington,2011-12-29 20:29:00,1928, The LLA that covers open alcohol in golf carts. and it overrides 32(1). The driver just cannot drive while holding onto a drink. Sec. 75 Regulation 719   Impaired charge can still apply.
651714,Mike the Pike,2011-12-30 00:14:00,3421,Unfortunately over the years the laws are strict due to too many incidents.  I rarely bring beer with me in the boat.When I go way up North in Quebec where it is permitted I do enjoy 1 or 2 beer while out in the boat.  What I can't understand in Ontario is why is there zero tolerance for booze and Ice fishing.There is no way you can fall through the hole unless you were renting a simcoe hut.  Ontario is a bit too harsh at times.  c'est la vie  MTP
651783,Fisherman,2011-12-30 02:44:00,7201,"Usually everyone goes home at the end of the day and that's where the problem comes in, booze and hmmm.. whooze goink todive ome? If you can't fish without booze you have a problem."
651785,BillM,2011-12-30 02:50:00,17367," Lew, I always remember my Dad having beer in the boat.  Not so much that he'd be drunk (I've never seen him drunk) but he'd always have a few.  I really didn't even think about it..  We used to do Algonquin Park in the spring when I was a little kid and he'd bring two beer balls (I'm sure you remember those) for a week!!  lol!!"
651787,Spouph,2011-12-30 03:06:00,115,"correct me if I'm wrong however, driving in a boat boozed is just the same as driving in a car as far as licenceing is concerned.  My buddy just spent ten grand getting of an impared.  It's really not worth the buzz to get caught by the fuzz.  Saying that I allow a couple beers on the boat all the time to my passangers.  I'll even provide one or two and have been stopped by the police many times.  The key is to not be showing the police any reason to charge you.  The police for the most part have been reasonable, and obviously don't leave it lying aroud don't get pissed.  treat it like you were 15, sneaking a beer from the old boy.  He always knew but it was how we acted that prompted his reaction.  good luck and great fishing"
651797,Mike the Pike,2011-12-30 03:25:00,3421,  I agree perhaps that is the problem Drinking and driving.  Don't have a problem.Once in a while I enjoy a couple of beer while ice fishing in the Province of Quebec where it is legal to do so.  Nothing wrong with a couple of moderate drinks.
651823,sirfish,2011-12-30 06:09:00,175, ...and they would find that they are NOT permitted back into Canada via any border as thier passports are swiped and it will get flagged.The same applies on the U.S side for us Canucks. Hence virtually eliminating any further problems concerning alcohol in the boat next trip.

651860,doubleheader,2011-12-30 14:11:00,497,Your friend is not respecting the Canadian law nor is he respecting you. Obviously this bothers you or you wouldn't have made the post. Do the right thing and you won't have to worry ever again. Turn your head and you'll be worrying every time he's on your boat.
651882,lookinforwalleye,2011-12-30 15:50:00,4399,Never any beer in my boat period!
651922,smally21,2011-12-30 19:27:00,993,"'zero tolerance' on anything is essentially someone (the man) admitting they are unable or unwilling to catch and punish the actual offenders. throw a blanket over everyone and they are easy to enforce.  if it was legal to drink in moderation in your boat enforcement agencies would actually have to tell the difference between a dude having a beer with his old man in the boat and a bunch of lunatics in a high powered wakeboard boat terrorizing the lake with their stereo cranked. laws are written 'for the greater good' so the largest group has the highest level of safety, real or imagined.  it is the way it is can't really point the finger at who screwed it up in the first place...  all i know is beer and sunny days and good friends seem like a pretty good combination. if it wasn't unlawful, cold beers would be on my boat in reasonable quantities. the law being what it is, it is not worth the expense and penalties for the sake of a cold beer.  like our moms asked us in college ""can't you have a good time without drinking?"" seemed like a stupid question when i was nineteen...  as i slowly grow up, the question makes more sense"
651925,Muskieman,2011-12-30 19:44:00,2472,Well....  In 2000 I was in a paddleboat that had a built-in cooler{ full of Molson EX & Smirnoff Ice}... sunshade.. stereo and rodholders... My buddy and I paddled all over Nipissing's Cache Bay with it. By the time we made it to the mouth of the Veuve River we were going in circles...PLASTERED!!! We were using weeds as bait our shorts as facilities and looked like Lobsters..  And out of nowhere the OPP!! They told us that they were 20 yards away all along for the past 10 minutes laughing at us. We had the lifejackets and the whole shebang ... we even kept the empties and were good boys and didn't pollute the lake.  Charges were: Public Intoxication 65$ If I remember correctly.. We were not put under arrest our Booze was not confiscated and we were allowed to leave VIA paddleboat so long as we didn't drive when we got to shore.   But on the other hand.............  After camping on an Island on Gull Lake hwy 805 60 miles from nowhere.... My buddy came ashore sober after spending a night on an Island with his wife. The alcohol he had brought with him for the week was In the bow of the boat a half full 60oz of rye.  The OPP made him pour it over the firepit and proceeded to charge him with open alcohol...110.00$ 60 miles in the bush...It was 7:00 in the morning ...go figure..   I guess you never know.  Randy 
651393,Roy,2011-12-28 16:04:00,13728,The rules for alcohol and boating here in Quebec are the same as anywhere else in Canada. I concede however that the authorities here are more tolerant.

651404,Fish4Eyes,2011-12-28 16:42:00,1022, I remember thinking how the heck is this legal when I'm so smashed
651408,wjw,2011-12-28 17:02:00,35,"Andy, thanks for the detailed response and to everyone else that contributed.  Something that I should have added in the first post is that we rent our boat, alternate days of driving, and share all the expenses. Under the belief that I was in compliance, the alcohol was not an issue and totally his personal choice/risk. Any suggestion to keep it back in the cabin was simply for the purpose of saving him the expense/trouble. Now that the drivers responsibility has been clarified, something has to change."
651413,wkrp,2011-12-28 17:18:00,656, I grew up the same way and sometimes wonder how I made it this far!
651417,danbouck,2011-12-28 17:39:00,4380," ya, it's also silly that I can't drink while driving my truck down the highway. I just want to enjoy the drive  "
651437,fishing n autograph,2011-12-28 20:29:00,2540,"  That's like saying its okay to sit in your car, in your driveway drinking in the drivers seat...."
651438,fishing n autograph,2011-12-28 20:35:00,2540,"  To answer your question, if you're the operator of the vessel and haven't been drinking you're fine under the criminal code. However, under thr LLA you're looking at about 4 or 5 tickets totalling about $600.....  And to clarify, if you are driving in Ontario and you get a ticket here it will affect your drivers license if you're from another province and the majority of the Northern states and vice versa for us Ontarians...."
651453,Fisherman,2011-12-28 21:34:00,7201," And, if I not wrong and you don't pay, try renewing you DL or registration."
651470,GBW,2011-12-28 22:31:00,8460,if I had a sip of beer in my mouth it would be all over my desk!
651483,Jer,2011-12-28 23:17:00,1426,   You mean it isn't? Why not?
651484,Jer,2011-12-28 23:20:00,1426,"   It would surprise me if that was an offence as well. I do it all the time fishing from the dock, sometimes I sit on the rear pedestal seat in my boat. How is that illegal?"
651486,Woodsman,2011-12-28 23:24:00,1286,Liquor out of residence!! Even if it's your dock it is still in public waters.
651499,fishing n autograph,2011-12-28 23:40:00,2540,"Its a vessel, no different than drinking in your car so there is still a chance to be charged with care and control or over 80"
651502,cram,2011-12-29 00:02:00,1733, Except that in your boat it is in fact legal.
651503,fishing n autograph,2011-12-29 00:04:00,2540,Not if it doesn't have the proper facilities
651505,NAW,2011-12-29 00:17:00,4022,"A buddy of mine was floating about 15' off the end of his dock in a paddle boat.  He had a fishing rod, and a pint.  OPP roll up, and charge him for having the drink on the boat.  Told him he got off luck, because he didn't have his fishing licence on hand, and a PFD was not on board."
651532,BillM,2011-12-29 02:20:00,17367,"I'll be the first to admit I like having a beer with lunch while I'm out fishing with the oldman.  However this only occurs when we are way up north and in the middle of no where (Not like that makes it anymore legal).  I rarely if ever bring beer with me fishing (Unless I'm on a flyin or similar)...   I don't wanna know how much beer I consumed on our trip up to Eddies a few years ago..  It might have been a world record, lol!!!"
651550,Dozer,2011-12-29 03:08:00,896,"Just hide it really well, or dump it when you see them coming, wasn't in your boat at the time was it?  So its not yours.  Great system"
651582,Jer,2011-12-29 11:49:00,1426,"   But what about just having a beer or two, not to the point of impairment?  So the police have the power to enter my property and give me a ticket for having a beer while I work on my vehicle on my own driveway or on my boat tied to my own dock?  When did Ontario become a police state?"
651593,Fisherman,2011-12-29 13:17:00,7201," Why is it that some people don't bother to get educated about things and then just babble.  Unless you're a complete    and and doing stooopid things, working on the car/truck doesn't gather attention.  Similar to having the boat anchored/tied up and having the required amenities."
651602,mike rousseau,2011-12-29 14:50:00,4661,  ive learned to appreciate the lunch/afternoon pint/quart as well...just 1  but its always at a licensed restaurant on the water... or back at the boathouse...
651606,BillM,2011-12-29 15:16:00,17367,"There are certain times and places where I'll bend the rules.  But you wouldn't find me out in the Kawarthas with a cooler full of beer, lol."
651609,LeXXington,2011-12-29 15:29:00,1928, so sitting on the back tailgate of my truck and drinking a beer on my drive way is a no-no.  Guess you can thank the government for this one.  Driving a golf cart while drinking is fine.. but sitting on your boat tied up to your own property is a no-no.  Will someone please JUST THINK OF THE CHILDREN!!!
651620,fishing n autograph,2011-12-29 16:50:00,2540,actually drinking in a golf cart is illegal too lol it's considered a motor vehicle under the criminal code
651242,wjw,2011-12-27 23:31:00,35,"We fish Ontario every year,coming in from the states. Years ago I would take a few beers out on the water when I wasn't driving the boat. I stopped that practice when the authorities began cracking down. I have a fishing buddy that refuses to leave the alcohol back in the cabin. I keep telling him that it is only a matter of time until he is spotted or checked. He just flatly refuses to leave the booze behind.  I for years had thought that I was not violating any of the drinking laws because I was not drinking. Recently, someone told me that by driving the boat I also was in violation. This person added that with a conviction, I could be banned from coming back into the country. Hence, no more fishing trips or vacations there with my wife. Does anyone know what the law is?"
651243,OutdoorDan,2011-12-27 23:37:00,325,"If you have open cans/bottles of alcohol in your possession in the boat, it's going to be considered that you consumed them.  Even if they are not open, you are not allowed to consume the alcohol in a public place (ex. in the middle of the lake in your boat).  What happens in this case (if you are stopped and have unopened alcohol in the boat) depends on the circumstances.  If you have a water-access cottage somewhere and are transporting unopened packages of alcohol there, you are going to be fine.  Likewise, if you are going camping and have the proper equipment to stay overnight, you will be fine.  If you are obviously just going out fishing for the day in your boat and have booze on hand, it's going to get sticky..."
651244,Joey,2011-12-27 23:38:00,9122,"Well I'm not absolutely positive, but as far as I was told, the person with open alcohol would get a citation for alcohol out of residence.  If it is now you drinking it, you should be okay."
651293,Andy,2011-12-28 01:38:00,330," If he is drinking and has open alcohol, you will get a ticket as driver/operator. Here is the text from the Liqour License Act re; open alcohol on boat.  **No person shall operate or have the care or control of a boat that is underway while there is contained in the boat any liquor, except under the authority of a licence or permit. R.S.O. 1990, c. L.19, s. 32 (3).  Exception  (4)  Subsection (3) does not apply if the liquor in the boat,  (a) is in a container that is unopened and the seal unbroken; or  ( is stored in a closed compartment. R.S.O. 1990, c. L.19, s. 32 (4).  Search of vehicle or boat  (5)  A police officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that liquor is being unlawfully kept in a vehicle or boat may at any time, without a warrant, enter and search the vehicle or boat and search any person found in it. R.S.O. 1990, c. L.19,   Here is text that defines a boat as a private place which would allow consumption of alcohol.  ***7)  A boat with permanent sleeping accommodations and permanent cooking and sanitary facilities, other than a boat used to carry passengers for hire is considered to be a private place while the boat is at anchor or is secured to the dock or land. R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 718, s. 3 (7). (like an anchored houseboat)  (8)  If a boat is considered under subsection (7) to be a private place and is secured to a dock or land to which the public is not ordinarily invited or permitted then the dock or land is considered to be a private place except at the times when the public is invited or permitted access to it. R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 718, s. 3 (8).  I don't know how I got the smiley face in there, just ignore that. I don't know if a ticket would keep you out of the country. Andy"
651296,craigdritchie,2011-12-28 01:43:00,1586,Here's all you need to know: http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety/debs-obs-quick-quick_visitor-1610.htm  In a nutshell:  Alcohol may be consumed on board the pleasure craft only if it meets all of the following conditions:  The vessel has permanent sleeping facilities The vessel has permanent cooking facilities The vessel has a permanent toilet The vessel is anchored or secured alongside a dock  End of story.
651299,Jer,2011-12-28 02:03:00,1426,"  A ticket for violation of the Liquor License Act will have no bearing on entry to the country. The Act is provincial legislation no different than the Highway Traffic Act and a speeding ticket.  As long as you, the operator, has not been drinking beyond impairment, there would be no criminal charges that could affect entry. Simply a monetary fine and probable confiscation of the offending alcohol.  That being said, if it's your boat and you don't want any booze aboard, you should be telling your ""buddy"" to stay ashore."
651304,Fisherman,2011-12-28 02:39:00,7201,"You're the owner/operator/captain of the boat, get a belt, pull up your pants and grow some kahunas or go back into the kitchen and find an apron."
651355,Fish4Eyes,2011-12-28 13:20:00,1022,"I tell people that I don't recommend you do that and remind them that it is not allowed. If they insist, I let them know that they will be paying all fines associated with a potential incident."

651358,lew,2011-12-28 13:39:00,12766,"10 years ago 2 friends of mine were out fishing and the passenger was drinking a beer (the only one he had) and was spotted by the police. He was given a $125 ticket and the driver, who wasn't drinking, was told that seeing as he was in charge of the boat,  could also be charged, basically for permitting open beer in his boat."
651360,Ralph Field,2011-12-28 13:45:00,1018,"Since the anglers are from the USA they would be fined , but probably not have to pay the fines. US citizens don't have to pay speeding tickets or 407 charges unless they choose to."

Not to mention the fishing's better and most of the people are more pleasant to be around.  There are so many boating rules in Ontario it's silly. We can thank the cottagers in Muskoka for that.

651379,LeXXington,2011-12-28 15:28:00,1928,"  This is correct, just never plan on coming back to Canada ""ever"".  I also think they are now sharing traffic ticket information cross boarder.  Have fun."
651380,Lip-ripper,2011-12-28 15:29:00,228,"All I meant was...  When you have a deluge of weekend warriors ripping all over lakes every which way in every type of PWC and boat available, I agree that a stricter stance on drinking should be enforced.  However, when a few fishermen want to have a couple beer and enjoy a day on the water, they can now be fined. Silly IMO.  Heck, part of the reason for it now being law to have your boaters card was because of the boat traffic on these busy lakes."
651382,LeXXington,2011-12-28 15:34:00,1928," I thought, if you are tied up at your own dock, you can sit on your boat and drink as its considered private property.  I would be interested if anyone can confirm that?"

You can't go fishing without a beer in the boat, somethings wrong. I like my beer like the next guy but I save it for land plus the fish get bigger after a few"
651387,mercman,2011-12-28 15:40:00,7054," Not in an small open fishing boat you can't.Plus, we have some pretty unfriendly people here, just like anywhere else. Cant figure out why it so important to drink beer in your boat Cant drink beer in your car, and we are all still alive."
651388,craigdritchie,2011-12-28 15:41:00,1586,"Um ... who on earth told you that? Fines do not become voluntary when someone lives out of jurisdiction.    Not true. Most Canadian boating regs are Federal, not Provincial, since they fall under the Shipping Act."
