The operator said, ""I'll be glad to help, dear.  What's the name and room   number of the patient?""   The grandmother in her weak, tremulous voice said, ""Norma Findlay, Room 302.""   The operator replied, ""Let me put you on hold while I check with the nurse's   station for that room.""   After a few minutes, the operator returned to the phone   and said, ""I have good news.  Her nurse just told me that   Norma is doing well.  Her blood pressure is fine; her blood   work just came back normal and her physician, Dr. Cohen,   has scheduled her to be discharged tomorrow.""   The grandmother said, ""Thank you. That's wonderful.  I   was so worried.  God bless you for the good news."" The operator replied,  ""You're more than welcome.  Is   Norma your daughter?""  The grandmother said, ""No, I'm   Norma Findlay in Room 302.    No one tells me crap."""
