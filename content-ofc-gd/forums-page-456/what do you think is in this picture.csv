651537,Leecher,2011-12-29 02:28:00,7832,Looks like a spud that's frozen in
651541,limeyangler,2011-12-29 02:39:00,5204,  Its an axe...yes....but there is no snow.   LOL...nope.
651547,Entropy,2011-12-29 02:58:00,747,part of your toe?
651548,Terry,2011-12-29 03:03:00,14456,a wax job to stop it from rusting
651556,limeyangler,2011-12-29 03:31:00,5204,lol...ok...its pretty disgusting...but its actually a layer of our dogs tongue stuck to the axe head. We heard an almighty yelp....then the dog appeared from inside the garage with blood around his mouth....that was a lesson learned the hard way....dont lick metal objects when it is minus -20 C!  Dog is fine by the way.
