651565,steelie hunter,2011-12-29 04:42:00,55,"Did for a few years, a few years back. The cottages are excellent, warm, big kitchens, tv, dvd player, great after a day in the hut.  The huts were of good size too, with a nice propane stove, could wear t-shirts inside, even on the coldest of days.  The fishing was hit or miss. One year about 5 years ago, couldnt keep the eyes off the hook, a few whities, lots of perch. Then the next couple years it was just whities and perch, and a couple eyes, the odd pike. Due to school I havent been in a couple years, as well as the fishery being in rough shape, but it sounds like it is starting to make a recovery at least."

I have to disagree with this statement, the walleye catches during spring, summer and fall have been fantastic in the last few years. Something has changed in the feeding habits of the walleye during the winter months on Nipissing. Now the sport is to find out new ways to catch them."
