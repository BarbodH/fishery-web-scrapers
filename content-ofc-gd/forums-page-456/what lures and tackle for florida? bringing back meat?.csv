651683,ch312,2011-12-29 22:03:00,1590,"what lures and tackle should i take along for our trip to florida? i've found quite a few places to fish on the east side and the keys, but can't figure out what to take. i figure a 7-8ft medium action ugly stick with 40lb PP will work, but what about tackle?  let's say i catch a couple keepers. will i have any problems crossing the border with a few fish?  what about gator and other exotic meats?   i've looked on the border services website, but can't find anything about these meats."
651686,waki5,2011-12-29 22:22:00,34,if your fishing the inner coastal  i had lots of luck with a gold Mepps Syclops 5 and 8 grams. just remember to rinse your gear and wadders with fresh water at the end of the day.
651687,BillM,2011-12-29 22:37:00,17367,"Docs Goofy Jigs and half a shrimp...  Catch all kinds of stuff (Pomps, whitings, mackeral, sharks, etc)  "
651689,Rich Nelson,2011-12-29 22:40:00,332,"Jig and shrimp will catch lots of different things... Gold spoons work well, and some rapalas/ minnow imitators. No idea about crossing border with fish."
651690,GBW,2011-12-29 22:44:00,8460,I would say NO to border crossing with fish and or other meat.  you can't even bring oranges to Ont from FLA by car.
651691,BillM,2011-12-29 22:46:00,17367,"Yeah, I'd probably just eat as much fish as humanly possible while you're down there and don't bother bringing any back across the border."
651824,sirfish,2011-12-30 06:24:00,175,"Ch..No worries on bringing back fish.I have done it the past 10yrs from the outer banks and Chesapeake bay and I also bring back Steelhead and Walleye from New york State.Its no different from going to Tops for groceries. Make sure its prefrozen and packed in ice. There is a difference when it comes to fruit..we can't bring it back and we can't bring it over from Canada. You should be able to pick up some Pompano rigs at most tackle shops,great for fishing the surf for Pompano,Blues,Croakers,Sea Trout(all edible) and anything else that decides to scoop it up. Good luck good fishing. P.S those Docs are killer."
651863,Mike Pike,2011-12-30 14:43:00,1332,"Although I've primarily fished the piers and shore along the west coast of Florida, I found live shrimp cast out with some weight a foot or two up the line to get 'er down to the bottom pretty much worked for everything.  Snappers, Jacks, Sheephead, etc.  Fun, simple and productive.  Any bait and tackle shop will let ya know where there are good locations to fish from shore and which locations have bait shacks with live shrimp.  Good luck and good fishing( and good eating! )."
651917,ch312,2011-12-30 19:06:00,1590,thanks for the tips. my tackle is packed and ready to rock.  pics will be posted shortly after our return along with some gopro videos
