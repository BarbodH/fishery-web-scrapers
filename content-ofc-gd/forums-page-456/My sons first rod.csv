Close enough...lol  I figure I can help him hold and crank this toy... So he's ready for the real thing ASAP...  Sorry  Forgot the pic  
651715,Live2fish85,2011-12-30 00:15:00,1633,Thats awesome. My daughter just turned two. This summer she was always pretending to fish with me from my parents dock and now she is reeling in and can cast about 5 feet lol. I am sure in no time your little guy will be catching musky bigger then him.
