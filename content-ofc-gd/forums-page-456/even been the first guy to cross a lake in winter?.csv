WNPS Nipissing Caution:  ""West Nipissing Police Service would like to advise the public that as of December 29th 2011 safe ice has yet to form on Lake Nipissing and surroundings Lakes and Rivers.  On Thursday two snowmobilers from Sturgeon Falls area attempting to cross Lake Nipissing, broke through the ice near Iron Island and managed to swim to safety and walk back to mainland.  The West Nipissing Police Service is asking the public to use proper and extreme safety precautions before venturing onto frozen surfaces.  Although climate has been favorable over the past few days, we want to advise that proper ice as yet to form on Lake Nipissing and area waters.""    Johns observation:   On Being First Across the Big Lake in Winter:  ""I often wonder what it feels like to be the first across the lake in winter ? I wonder is it just the plain old adrenalin rush of the first really fast ride across with no other tracks to follow ?  Or is it that anxious electric twist that occurs in the colon knowing full well that $13,000 worth of hi-tech toy could disappear from betwixt ones legs at any time into an unknown depth of water in a very lonely part of the lake ?  Is it the swell of pride that occurs knowing that ones best buddy will surely risk his own life for you, unless of course he miscalculated too and ends up testing his new floater suit and is equally filled with helplessness, raw fear, exquisite pain and instant remorse as the suit fills with needle like icy water ?  Is it the self importance that if the suit protects one from hypothermia but one cannot get out of the water that one may still depend on our friends in the local rescue services that will likely put their own lives at risk to get one out of this predicament brought to one by self will run riot ?  Is it hope knowing that there are hospitals where one can be helicoptered to for treatment of hypothermia complications ? I wonder what it feels like ? There is always someone first across the big lake with varying degrees of success. I wonder if there is some secret prize ?  If one lives, is he the winner ? If one dies out there it must be a horrible lonely way to go.  So fear, hope, pride, self-importance, or the electric twist of a lower bowel could all be feelings associated with this annual activity in the north. But then so could an absolute feeling of hopelessness as one reaches the end out there. all alone and helpless.""  I hope I never find out.  J.B.    Randy "

651933,COUNTRYBOY,2011-12-30 20:55:00,130,BEEN THE FIRST TO CROSS THE LAKE BUT WITH SOME CAUTIONS IN HAND AND COMMON SENCE OK SO FAR. ALSO I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO GO THROUGHT THE ICE AND PUT MY ARMS OUT TO STOP ME FROM GOING UNDER. THE COLD WATER AT THE TIME DIDN'T SEEM TO BOTHER ME AS MUCH AS THE FACT I WAS ALONE..CAN I GET OUT WITHOUT THE ICE BREAKING MORE...AND IF I GET ON TOP AGAIN...WHERE DO I WALK  BE SAFE
652033,bigugli,2011-12-31 03:13:00,6138,"Been first across a few times. Shoulda soiled my drawers on more than one occasion. Running 6 Mile, full out, on an old Olympic listening to the ice breaking beneath me as I ran through one of the narrows. Also been fool enough for several years to be first one swimming after ice out. First few seconds is mind numbing shock followed by sheer exhilaration and an adrenalin rush. Mind I was one of them Finns who jumps out of a 200F sauna to roll in the snow.(before the coronary  )"
652045,mike rousseau,2011-12-31 03:26:00,4661,Someone dies most years in my area...  Current and ice dont mix well...  Be carefully on the rivers everyone...
652081,manitoubass2,2011-12-31 06:06:00,11391," Very, very true. I'm on Rainy and I can speak from experience that all rules of the lake/ice are out the window. Especially near heavy current/rapids.  My vouche to take it easy on Rainy this year was in due to some close calls last year. We had very experienced people all pulling the shacks off near the same time and all of us had some close calls. The river does some crazy things.  Of course the current plays a part, but alot of people underlook the raising/lowering water fluctuations.  34"" in one spot, 3"" in the next. Very unpredictable. Always drill your way to the spot! (on a river anyhow)  ***This post is made under the influence. It made sense to me at the time. Please be safe on the ice!!!***     "
