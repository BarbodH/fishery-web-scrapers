650983,SirCranksalot,2011-12-26 02:31:00,3291,One Xmas we made  a trifle with rumpot/rumtopf instead of the regular fruit.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumtopf

651004,woodenboater,2011-12-26 04:22:00,2277,"I thought you were referring to the huge Asian supermarket lol. That turkey looks great and the dogs look like they were scoping out leftovers  btw, that trifle looks enormous for one person or is the glass deceivingly large  ?"
651011,HTHM,2011-12-26 04:58:00,4082,"Sorry Joey, but my wife's turkey was better.....Yours was very good, but I gotta stand up for my wife. However the trifle, now that looked fantastic!!   :thumbsup_anim:"

651029,shane,2011-12-26 15:20:00,652,Why do you need a dishwasher when you have two dogs in the house?
651150,Squid,2011-12-27 15:10:00,1656,Dogs are giving the dishes a pre-wash!! Love the Trifle J!
651151,limeyangler,2011-12-27 15:26:00,5204,MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM....turkey looks yummy.   LOL...i have to laugh....the pic of Ralphy in the dishwasher reminds me that i keep shutting our new puppy's head in the dishwasher...as soon as i open it...his head is in there...and i'm still not 100% used to having him around.   Q: What is over 1000 feet high?   A: The 'TRIFLE TOWER'..
651191,misfish,2011-12-27 20:03:00,29133,"Boy he,s growing fast J. Looks like you dont need a dish washer. They,ll just lick the plates clean.LOL"

651309,Joey,2011-12-28 03:50:00,9122,"Thanks Guys, the trifle went a long way, but sadly, had to be put to rest today, got all runny.  I'm sure I gained more than 3 lbs eating it, let alone looking at it  Yep, he's growing like a weed B.  He's a ton of fun to watch grow and learn.  Really enjoying him and can't wait to see how he grows up and for all the new things he'll see for the first time, like snow tonight  "
