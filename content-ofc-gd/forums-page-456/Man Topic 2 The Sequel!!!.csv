652053,richyb,2011-12-31 03:34:00,774,I only have 2 for some reason I had to buy one for my wedding and also my brothers wedding
652055,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-31 03:36:00,10439, Why didn't you just use the one you bought for your wedding for your brothers wedding. It's not like it was worn out!!!
652059,richyb,2011-12-31 03:44:00,774,  The one from my wedding was black and he wanted to have his wedding party to wear white ones .. blah blah blah as if photoshop couldnt fix up the pics later. I had to get the brother in law to tie both of them for me. lol

652101,Familyfisherman,2011-12-31 12:10:00,188,"I wear ties weekly at work...need more than 10 for sure.  If you changed these polls to ""how many shirts you actually HAVE"" and people had to actually count their shirts/ties that would be pretty interesting...sadly I'm sure everyone's numbers would be MUCH higher than they realize..."
652102,crappieperchhunter,2011-12-31 12:18:00,2582,Not sure how many I have. My son works at a bank now so I gave him some he liked cause he wears one pretty much everyday.  The last time I wore one myself was about 10 years ago.
652114,fish_fishburn,2011-12-31 12:50:00,1311,I got two new ties for Christmas. That puts me around ten I think. At 40 to 50 bucks a pop there nice gifts if you wear ties every day. The double windsor knot is my knot of choice.
652118,Roy,2011-12-31 13:02:00,13728,These dingbat polls remind me of facebook drivel. I don't know when this happened...I never received a memo.
