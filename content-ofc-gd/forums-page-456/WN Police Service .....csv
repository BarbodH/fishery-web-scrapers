651699,Roy,2011-12-29 23:24:00,13728," Yes Brian that's the terrible part of ice fishing...the start and end of seasons. Meanwhile there could have been a couple of very knowledgeable, experienced fishermen out there who knew that they were safe on that thickness....but someone decided to ride their sled over to ask them how the fishing was and BANG!  PLEASE be careful, others aren't."
651701,Muskieman,2011-12-29 23:28:00,2472,"must have been cottagers or joyriders, fishing is closed on Nip ... opens on Jan 1st."
651702,misfish,2011-12-29 23:29:00,29133,"  Yep, seen it last year Roy. But really,a sled on first ice? Walking ya,but some people need to use their noodle a bit more."
651712,Fisherman,2011-12-30 00:02:00,7201,"Unfortunately that's where natures stuck some peoples brains, in their ""noodle"". Fortunately no rescue guys had to stick their necks out for them."
