He found his ball and saw an opening between two trees he thought he could hit through.  Taking out his 3-wood, he took a mighty swing. The ball hit a tree, bounced back, hit him in the forehead and killed him.  As he approached the gates of Heaven, St. Peter asked, ""Are you a good golfer?""  The man replied: ""Got here in two, didn't I?"""
