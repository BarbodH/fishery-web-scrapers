He had his on for about a minute, as it just held bottom, gave some head shakes and then the hook slipped. I don't know how he missed it since he set the hook three times... dull hooks maybe, or maybe he hooked it in soft flesh. My big one was a log as I set the hook, but it slipped pretty much immediately.   Oh well... I'm all smiles at catching my first good feed of walleye for the ice season at a new spot. Can't wait for Nipissing to have over 12"" of ice so I can hit my regular spots. I hope others are enjoying the recent cold spell too.  Sorry no pics, my hands got cold quick after scooping the minnows with my hands. I forgot a bucket and dip net.  Fish on to all  "

651758,mercman,2011-12-30 01:45:00,7054,"  Forgot to ask. Were ya trolling, or jigging Chad?"
651759,Rod Caster,2011-12-30 01:47:00,5784," You guys caught a bunch earlier this week didn't you? I only caught perch at that spot on Monday... I think that was you guys beside us, was it? I was the guy who drilled like 15 holes before a couple friends showed up."
651762,Rod Caster,2011-12-30 01:49:00,5784,"  All vertical. 7 inches of ice. We treaded lightly and followed the shoreline, but the ice in our spot was safe for walking."
651763,spud7378,2011-12-30 01:51:00,68,"  nope this was our first time out this year, nip was up north and had a few i think? i was thinking about heading back out tommorrow? were you using chubs or shiners?"
651771,Rod Caster,2011-12-30 02:01:00,5784,"  I'd like to go tomorrow as well, but I have plans for dinner. We used shiners. Nipfisher knows where we were... just look for our drill holes."
