651827,Roy,2011-12-30 08:10:00,13728,"Unless regulations have changed recently, it's legal to sell trout roe in Ontario provided you have a license."
651837,HTHM,2011-12-30 12:21:00,4082,"Tell the MNR, then us."
651838,Roy,2011-12-30 12:24:00,13728, That's also a good point.

652074,Glaucus,2011-12-31 05:18:00,48,"   Uh oh!!!  Buying or selling includes ""barter or trade""    http://ontariofishin...showtopic=45141        If the mods have any integrity they won't delete this post!!!!  The mods as well as the community know who to call:sarcasm:"
652076,FieroLuke,2011-12-31 05:23:00,24,Only a registered business can sell it from what I understand and then I believe it has to be bought from a fish farm and not wild caught.  Not only is it illegal but that price is also a rip off. You can buy legal roe for a lot less than that at some local online fishing stores.
652079,ChrisK,2011-12-31 05:45:00,2772,"No reason to delete this post. Spiel and his friend merely gifted each other some game and there's nothing wrong with that unless there was no beer consumed at the time of the gifting,then  that would be just wrong...."
652082,spinnerdoc,2011-12-31 06:28:00,556,So why not you then? Haven't got the balls?
652105,solopaddler,2011-12-31 12:25:00,8605,"  Wow, you're digging pretty deep here.  Not sure what your motives are, but I'd suggest you get a life."
652127,HTHM,2011-12-31 14:00:00,4082,"I think if integrity is to be called into play, then this issue should have been dealt with in a PM between yourself and the individuals called into question. Since you have gone public, so will I. Oh, I also agree with Solo, there is a life to be had, go find one."

If he decides to take it to P.M. with the person he feels has ""wronged society"" then we will reevaluate this thread.   Art"
