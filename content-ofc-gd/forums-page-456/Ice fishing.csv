651870,oldphart,2011-12-30 15:02:00,665,"~~~~The only real downer of this post is the City view, and my building where I work is the Condo on the right. Tried to phish the inner canals one year the Police forced us off saying we were endangering our lives, along with the people that would be dispatched to save us, that year we had 8"" of ice"
651934,Rob,2011-12-30 20:55:00,467,"Hey Terry, I was looking at your post and those changing pictures at the bottom of your posts, the one with holding that big Lake Trout, that is my old sled in the background. I remember that day you caught that, you got it on the Meegs jig and it just hammered your line and put up a good fight. The guy was there from meegs and he video taped you getting that. If I remember right you were the only one to catch a fish that day. Nice picture.  Rob C"
651935,misfish,2011-12-30 21:01:00,29133,"I knew, I seen that sled some where."
651937,Rob,2011-12-30 21:05:00,467,"Yup she was definitely a back breaker that one  That time I went out with Ravine Rat and did the loop around the lake I just about died, every muscle and joint was just a achin! Sold it for the same price I bought her for and the guy drove it right on to his trailer.   Rob C"
651944,Terry,2011-12-30 22:00:00,14456, yup that was the fish it was a fine fish

651468,Terry,2011-12-28 22:26:00,14456,thanks all it was great to get out and fish on the ice....... hope to be getting out again soon but where oh where
651469,GBW,2011-12-28 22:29:00,8460,"maybe at Sin's ice hut warming party?  after all, he's going to need 30 people to move it...."
651493,Terry,2011-12-28 23:35:00,14456,"sounds ok  but will it seat 30  and is he supplying the beer   back on shore after a day of moving the hut because we all know ""water on the water and beer on the pier"" and it would be wrong to drink out there  once we have ""safe ice""  hope I covered everything...LOL"
651496,misfish,2011-12-28 23:38:00,29133,  Party pooper. LMAO
651526,Ron,2011-12-29 02:11:00,1683,"Obviously you can tell Lloyd wasn't with you.....   ""TERRY CAUGHT A FISH TERRY CAUGHT A FISH!!!"" ha ha ha   Nice haul Terry, good on ya bud...  Cheers, Ron..."
651549,Terry,2011-12-29 03:04:00,14456,LOL  there is some truth in that statement  but I wouldn't tell Lloyd  LOL
651594,Moosebunk,2011-12-29 13:19:00,3970,This whole report Terry kinda seemed like a dream come true day out for ya.  Impressive fishing!  Good show.  Andy makes me laugh too..
651598,Terry,2011-12-29 13:43:00,14456,"OK OK you caught me Bunk  I took some old photos and put my head on some I found on the internet with a mess of crappie and did a fake report  I am sorry but it seemed funny at the time everyone knows I couldn't catch fish if my life depended on it..but it made me feel so good     LOL         got you  of course I caught those crappie, you guys found it easier to believe I made the story up...LOL  but I did, I really did catch those beauties ...    no really I did"
651631,BucktownAngler,2011-12-29 17:46:00,582,"i dont get the blurred backgrounds? and the ""Lake X""  i thought this was a community? whats the point of posting this then? Just to brag?"
651637,Roy,2011-12-29 17:58:00,13728,Calm down boss. Terry has been here long enough that he knows what he's doing.
651638,Terry,2011-12-29 17:59:00,14456,"yes it is to brag  so I can say I am better then you  if you don't understand why I would remove the big building in the background that many people would recognize, then there is little reason to waste my time chatting with you but I did state that it was not my spot and I am sorry if it bothers you that I respected the guy that took me there as to not give up his spot..not of the guys I went with are members here... oh when I see you posting where you are fishing when they are very small secret spots, I just might do it too well not this spot because I told the guy I was with that I would blur the background .........."
651641,Roy,2011-12-29 18:20:00,13728,"And boss, I've read all of your posts (111) and they are almost without exception, questions about where to fish. Not one single report either. That's your choice but it certainly does not weigh heavily in you favour. Sorry but facts are facts."
651643,aplumma,2011-12-29 18:33:00,6896,Thats a nice wack of Crappie you all found. It is one of my favorite fish to eat.   Art
651645,BucktownAngler,2011-12-29 18:42:00,582," fair enough, i can respect that.  that shouldve been directed to the whole community and not just you.  i see a number of guys who do that."
651646,Terry,2011-12-29 19:06:00,14456,"I have only done it when someone I am with asks me to  but as there are so many people that come to this type of forum and their only goal is to find new spots by saving all the photos and trying to match them to the lakes.......so many people blur all their photos or just quit posting them  I come here to share with friends, and if you saw my posts from my first 2 years of going to temagami icefishing you would see I went 14 days without catching a fish and still I posted my trips.......just to share with friends...nothing to do with bragging  just sharing good times with friends"
651647,BucktownAngler,2011-12-29 19:10:00,582," i bet the majority of people who do that arent even members, they just do a quick google search, and find their way onto here."
651653,misfish,2011-12-29 19:48:00,29133,"For as many fish you catch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,YOU WERE BRAGGING."
651247,Terry,2011-12-27 23:52:00,14456,"I got asked to go to Lake X for some crappie fishing and couldn""t say no, I have been dieing to get out, Knew I had to do a bit of traveling to get some ice. we found the spot, threw a big rock on the ice and it did not go through so the march was on.. chip chip step was not the route this time it was chip chip crack craaaaaacccckkkkkkkk run crack step seems the water level had lowered sense the ice formed so there was a bit of a space between the ice and the water so we spud a hole and the ice cracks in 4 directions and you could feel the ice drop to the water level. I saw it drop where the ice met the rocky shoreline . after the first scare we checked and had 4"" of good black ice and all the way out it was the same thing, the one time I am sure I could see the crack run 400ft and shake a dock when it got to it.. but again good 4"" of ice we set up fishing and Andy gets 2 bass real quick he wasn't happy getting green bass as his first ice fish of the season..LOL I got the first crappie and we continued catching lots of them right through the day it started snowing pretty good and the wind picked up so we called it a day for the long ride home   <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=lakeX1.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/lakeX1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>   everyone had lots for a meal    this poor little frog was on the ice and half frozen, so we got him over near the shore and some open water so he could get down to some mud for the winter...or we just fed a big bass a nice frog.....     it was great getting on the ice  I can't wait to get out again closer to home  thanks guys it was great fishing and fun day"
651249,OutdoorDan,2011-12-27 23:56:00,325,"Wow, you nailed them.  Great work!"

651267,Terry,2011-12-28 00:38:00,14456,"yeah, It's not my spot so I can't say..  sorry"
651271,GbayGiant,2011-12-28 00:47:00,1780, That is great Crappy fishing. It is grood that you keep places like that to yourself.
651279,davey buoy,2011-12-28 00:58:00,5505,"If I could catch fish like that,I'd give ice fishing a third chance lol. Good going Terry!"
651305,Fisherman,2011-12-28 02:49:00,7201,"Hmmm, you really have to put in some more effort for the backdrop in the 4th pic."
651307,NAW,2011-12-28 02:56:00,4022," Hey... No worries Terry.  I'm gunna give my spot a try tomorrow.  Hopefully I run into some safe ice, and a few fish."
651308,Fish Farmer,2011-12-28 03:09:00,2234,"Nice catch Terry.   Just talked to my buddy, he suggests we may have to go farther north this year for safe ice. Built a box for my ATV, hope I get to use it."
