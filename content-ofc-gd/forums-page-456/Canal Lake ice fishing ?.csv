651587,turtle,2011-12-29 12:24:00,274,I am staying at a cottage on Canal Lk Jan 13th weekend and have plans to fish Simcoe with Tim Hales for perch.  As a back-up plan if the operator doesnt have his huts out looking to fish Canal close to the cottage. Location appears to be in the n-w arm of the lake.  Never fished Canal so looking for some advice.  I understand its a shallow weedy lake with panfish and pike.  Find the weed edges in 5-8 ft like on Scugog? Thanks.

I really wanted to post because I know there is a pretty good current moving through the main channel, I personally would be weary of the ice in that area.  Good Luck"

651625,turtle,2011-12-29 17:24:00,274, Thanks for the info and the head's up about the current. I've had the unfortunate experience to watch OPP divers pull bodies out of a hole in the ice in a narrows area between two lakes where there is current and always lousy ice.
