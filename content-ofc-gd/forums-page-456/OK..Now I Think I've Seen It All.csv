652125,mercman,2011-12-31 13:51:00,7054,Wonder how something like that slipped past the editors bench Or maybe it was intentional
652126,Live2fish85,2011-12-31 13:56:00,1633,I dont think they look at loons the same as us here in Canada. But regardless sounds like hes a crap fisherman when he has to snag something lol.
652128,farsider,2011-12-31 14:07:00,456,"I have not seen the loons episode but, I caught another where this dolt was fishing for Pike with what looked like a dinky butterfly sized net. Many, many attempts to ""net"" the fish.  Topped off by senseless thrashing in the boat.  What a tool!  Cheers, Mark"
652130,Roy,2011-12-31 14:11:00,13728,I never would have heard of the stupid show had you not posted about it ...but that was the producer's intent. We talk about it/they get limelight.
652142,bushart,2011-12-31 14:38:00,2628,Had this been Tomorrow I could have blamed it on New Years parties---for my hearing  But could'nt believe that one---I'll make sure I won't watch another minute of this guy

652155,Muskieman,2011-12-31 15:33:00,2472,"Loons like Ducks and most waterfowl mate for life , monogamous relationships .... If you are aware of the polygamy laws in Utah... that could possibly be a reason ."

652196,uglyfish,2011-12-31 18:28:00,981,"lol yea i seen that episode yesterday. show is really not a good one at all, seen a few episodes... now, i think he was joking about the loon thing, u could kinda see it in the way he talked and smiled... but... there are LOTS of ppl out there that arent good at reading between the lines... and im sure there are certain animal activists out there that will have a word about it. lol"
