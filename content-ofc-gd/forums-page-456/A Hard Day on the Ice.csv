Damn, you dasturdly whitefish!!!! At one point the bottom 9' was lit up like a Christmas tree but they just wouldn't hit. I ended up with just 2 hits the entire time and none hooked or landed. Time to go piking to get my groove one tomorrow. Here's a couple of shots.  The morning sun rising in the South (yes it rises in the South and sets in the West in the winter up here).    My LX-5 all lit up for the season!!!    Oh, ice thickness was close to 24"" and pure black!!!"
651570,Leecher,2011-12-29 05:19:00,7832,"Hey Dave... I think you should stick with pike   I saw your other report and those were nice gators   At least you have safe ice  Question:  Are you stuck using barbless hook in the north west territories? No obvious reason I ask, just curious?"
651571,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-29 05:22:00,10439,"Yep, it's all barbless and no live bait."
651573,Leecher,2011-12-29 05:37:00,7832," Ah I see... thanks for the info Dave    Must be frustrating at times to fight a fish a long time, only to see it spit the hook at the very last moment"
