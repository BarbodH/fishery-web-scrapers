So rule one is,no working alone.Was pissed I wasted my day not heading out with them,but I was going to make the best of my day. So,head home, grab my river gear and head out.  I went 1-5.3 were lost in submerged logs,the other was a leap and spit.  Great day for the riv. Met up with a friend and landed this one.   Work forsure wed/thurs,but the temps look good for a friday/saturday riv fish."
651195,Spiel,2011-12-27 20:19:00,9065,"No loss there Brian, you saved what started out as a lousy day!"

And before anyone says,oh your reel in the sand,ya I know.I had to remove the spool and wash it,an all was well again.Love this easy wash and go stuff.HAHAHA   I do have to add,Im getting away from the raven swivels. To many break off at the loop.Not the first time. Not sure what it is? My knots are no dif then any other I tye,and never had an issue."
