651677,Fishnwire,2011-12-29 21:33:00,983,"I've seen similar videos of people rescuing stuck deer and have also been left with the suspicion that the animals were too exhausted to fend for themselves afterwards.  It's still nice to see and I'd probably attempt the same thing.  Exhausted or not, the deer has a much better chance of survival on solid ground, than flaying on the ice endlessly.  Apparently, in this instance the deer eventually walked off into the bush...good stuff."
