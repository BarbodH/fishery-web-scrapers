650619,l2p,2011-12-23 22:46:00,346,"Been such an awsome fall season and for one am happy that its all about to slow down, I never thought id say it but I think im a little fished out haha. Ice season is taking its time but im not rushing either and I'll never officially put the float gear away as Niagara trips are often in the winter but sleep will be my best friend for the next few months   The restaurant is also in full holiday mode so after my short but sweet 10 days of time off in Jersey will be pretty much work work work, but thats never a bad thing!  Anyway here is my photo recap on being a river bum for the last few months...  So ended off the salmon season with my bud Mike hitting(actually hit and deep throated his bag) this spawned out ""dropback"" chinook right at the lake... lol.   From then on we switched over to Chrome mode and went hunting...  Lots of early morning days, most of which started of like this...      Ofcourse on trips(2-3 day missions) we would have extra time waiting for the sun so this became part of breakfast...   We ventured far and wide in our weekly search of steel. Exploring and walking stretches of rivers, some familiar some not.     Chrome        Colors       Rarely seen Gems    And on a very recent trip I managed to tame one of my biggest yet, I never measure or bother so I just go by what I remember... Trust me its hard to forget the big ones...  Shes almost double the cork on my 14 ft raven im8!   Nabbed her ""little sister"" later that morning.   And of course the beautiful end to everyday.     Wish everyone Happy Holidays and Tightlines!!"

651105,l2p,2011-12-27 03:10:00,346,"Haha lets just say that some of my friends hated me this season  Atlantics are always a great surprise! That one was my first adult, ive caught two other atlantics and they had yet still to return to the lake. What made it even more special was the fact that I saw it blast from the other corner of the pool in the corner of my eye to smash my roe bag that was just entering the pool through the top of the drift! That memory has been etched into my head"
