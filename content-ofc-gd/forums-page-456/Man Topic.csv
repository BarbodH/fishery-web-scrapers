651967,IndySKS,2011-12-30 23:44:00,134,"Ok i need to settle a dispute here:  Take into consideration how many different types of shirts their is, T shirts , golf shirts long sleeve dress shirts...well u get the idea.  Now how many shirts total should a man have?"
651972,Moosebunk,2011-12-30 23:53:00,3970,Whoa... good question... never thought about it.  7+7+7+7... gonna say about 20-30.
651974,OutdoorDan,2011-12-30 23:56:00,325,90-100?  Seriously?  Even at an average of 30$/shirt that is 3k you would be spending on just the shirt part of your wardrobe.  I have maybe 5 shirts I wear regularly and then a few other odd ones for around the house/outdoor trips.
651975,davey buoy,2011-12-30 23:56:00,5505,Don't forget about all the ones with the tears and holes in them that your not allowed to wear Lol
651976,ckrb2007,2011-12-30 23:58:00,449,i can honestly say that I don't own one single dress shirt or golf style shirt. lol Yet...I have a closet full of t-shirts - go figure.
651977,mike rousseau,2011-12-31 00:01:00,4661,i have a load of t-shirts....and a half dozen hoodies...  other then that i have 3-4 lol
651980,OutdoorDan,2011-12-31 00:03:00,325, Those are exactly the kind I wear on fishing/camping trips...
651983,Muskieman,2011-12-31 00:12:00,2472,  Yep.
651988,Skipper D,2011-12-31 00:52:00,1970,"I'll have to ask my wife , i don't have a clue"
651990,Rizzo,2011-12-31 01:34:00,4754,"This is a tough one. I don't ""need"" that many shirts, but the wife keeps on buying them. I have no clue what I've got so I'll take some guesses: T-shirts 25, long sleeve t shirts 5, dress shirts 20, casual shirts 12, golf shirts 10, hoodies/sweaters 10...in other words waaaayyy too many and I give a bunch away every year. My wife truly has a shopping problem"
651998,irishfield,2011-12-31 01:41:00,26272,What's next week.. shoes.. grow some pants!

652023,vance,2011-12-31 02:45:00,719,All a retired guy needs is some tees and a funeral outfit to wear to someone else's funeral   vance
652025,mercman,2011-12-31 02:46:00,7054,"  Shoes !! Good idea . 2 pairs casual, 1 dress, 2 sandals and 1 winter boots."
652030,Fisherman,2011-12-31 03:08:00,7201,"Even 10-20 is far too many, you can only wear one at a time."
652040,bigugli,2011-12-31 03:24:00,6138,Most of my shirts are disposables. 1 day of nicotine stains from greenhouse tomatoes and the shirt is ruined. Not worth trying to wash. I have just enough decent shirts not worn when farming.
652068,skeeter,2011-12-31 04:33:00,1907,I have over 50. I need them to match my fishing rods.  As for shoes/boots. I have a few of those but I like my pointed cowboy boots. They are great for kicking someone in the    that is deserving!
652119,mercman,2011-12-31 13:16:00,7054,"  Skeets, you are such a ""HAPPY"" man."
