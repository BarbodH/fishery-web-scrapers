Early yesterday 50 to 60 kilometers north of Toronto we has a pretty good little snow storm that lasted to the wee hour of this morning that left as much as 8'' on the ground north of hwy 400 & 11 ...  What's it means , its the largest snow fall so far this winter and with the amount of snow received it should help to bring the water temperatures down and help hurry along the ice forming process . I feel for all you guys who are patiently waiting and hope this bit helps . Now wish for cold nights ."
651394,Joey,2011-12-28 16:05:00,9122,Good news indeed.  I doubt I'll be catching my New Years Day carp this year tho
651395,Raf,2011-12-28 16:06:00,3495,"if you're hoping the snow will help ice production on thinly ice covered lakes, you are wrong, it will hinder it.  regardless, the snow was nice! got about 5-6 inches where I am."
651398,skeeter,2011-12-28 16:11:00,1907,Thanks for the good news skipper!  :thumbsup_anim:
651399,mike rousseau,2011-12-28 16:18:00,4661,That snow is just hitting us now...  And all my early ice sports have 1-3 inches... Now they will have insulation against the coming cold weather...  : (

651405,mercman,2011-12-28 16:47:00,7054,  Git the broom out Mike !!! gotta try my new ice rods
651419,Billy Bob,2011-12-28 17:52:00,5865,"Hey Skipper, what's this ""kilometer"" you speak of....   ....and how many days does it take to travel 50-60 of them....  Sounds like safe ice is just around the corner depending how many kilometers the corner is from you...  edited to change the typo word of ""is"" to ""ice"".....I don't want to be confused with President Clinton who asked the congressional committee what the meaning of ""is"" is..."
651427,Terry,2011-12-28 19:00:00,14456,"as stated snow is bad news for ice making cold weather , no wind is great news for ice making"
651457,misfish,2011-12-28 21:51:00,29133,"  Yea ,the snow makes no sence in the matter of the water getting cold.The river is cold,I know ,as I stood in it yesterday,frigg,n cold,but no ice. Like said,no wind and cold temps will make the ice form. The fog has been off for a week or so,the lake is ready.   BRING THE COLD NO WIND TEMPS."
651487,trevy727,2011-12-28 23:26:00,351,"Hey Billy bob, what is this ""safe is"" you speak of? Why don't you spell check your post before you make fun of others spelling."

651497,Twocoda,2011-12-28 23:39:00,4130,"i hope this ""ice disease/condition"" isnt contagious....i would hate for it to happen in my area...."
651498,trevy727,2011-12-28 23:39:00,351,got it
651500,mercman,2011-12-28 23:42:00,7054,"  I dont see fun making Bob and Skip are friends. Bob is in NY, so he deals in miles, not kilometers. Now you get it?"
651578,Billy Bob,2011-12-29 11:12:00,5865," Oh, good catch......it should of read ""safe ice""....."
651579,Skipper D,2011-12-29 11:26:00,1970,"Good morning Redneck , you going fishing ta day?"
651580,Billy Bob,2011-12-29 11:32:00,5865,"No ice here....not even close as of today.....and boat is in storage, but I gave up late boat season a while back when I had the ""indecent"" towing my rig up a hill with about 1"" of snow on the road...."
651581,Skipper D,2011-12-29 11:37:00,1970,"Trucks , trailer , hills and snow , fun hu ......... We live in some hilly country where i am so i know what you mean .Any how there old boy , i have to get out the door here and take care of a couple of new customers , you have your self a good one , keep your  out of trouble ok.............. lol"
651583,Jer,2011-12-29 11:51:00,1426,   ...maybe you need some better tires on that Tundra...
651584,Skipper D,2011-12-29 11:57:00,1970,  Are'nt  all those rednecks suppose to have tractor tires on their pickups ? ...Have a good one boys
651586,Billy Bob,2011-12-29 12:23:00,5865," Tundra has great tires.....just ask the Bridgestone man and he'll tell you why they cost over $800.00 for set of 4.....  However, this was my Ford E-150 Van that only made it half way up the hill before the whole rig decided to slide down backwards in the dark on a winding hill....only through my expertise driving skills (luck) that I was able to gain control of this frightful event with just minimal damage to my boat and trailer (right tail light broken and very small ding where the transom and starboard gunnel fasten) when we came to rest against the guard rail....  But I didn't give up because I was still young and dumb....we pushed on to Chautauqua Lake by going around the big stupid hill (add about 30 miles to the trip) where found some ice at the boat launch....but again this didn't stop us.....broke through the ice with my trusty Grumman like a friggin USA Coast Guard Icebreaker only to find out my steering was frozen up on the boat.....like a good little Redneck a quick solution was found by pouring lake water onto the frozen area....  We then motored up the lake about 7 miles to my favorite December hot spot where we knocked the nuts off them their walleyes.... ...(think limit times 3)...  At least on the way home the sun burned off the snow off the roads so I didn't have to drive home the long way...  Was it worth.....back then I would have said yes....today I would say I must have been nuts to go through all that for a fish.... ...and that's why my trusty Grumman is in hibernation until sometime in March..."
