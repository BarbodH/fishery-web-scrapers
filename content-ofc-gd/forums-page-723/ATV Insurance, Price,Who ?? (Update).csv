434806,Fish Farmer,2010-02-19 17:41:00,2234,"Guys, I just bought an ATV. Can you tell me were to get cheap Insurance. Didn't think it was so hard. My Home and auto, don't insure ATV's. One place I called wanted $800.00 Thanks Farmer"
434810,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-02-19 17:57:00,1362,I go through The Personal Insurance Co.  My 2008 Kawi 650cc is costing me $251 with $300 deductible....that's full coverage all perils.....$800 is crazy!!  Keep in mind that I have our 2 trucks insured with them as well....It may be difficult to get insurance just on the ATV.

434838,Fisherman,2010-02-19 20:30:00,7201,"TD Primmum, they do individual items, no need to have home/auto or other things with them, most likely the cheapest too.  Call before you leap into the frying pan."
434917,Fish Farmer,2010-02-20 02:24:00,2234,"Pm sent, thanks cityfisher    I've been calling around, some company's tell me if I have my auto and home with them, they give you a brake, it's cheaper. If it's just an ATV, your going to pay large. The cheapest I've got so far is with Believer Plus, $315.00 bare bones, just liability add fire theft $470.00 I'll try TD and see, but I may have to have an account with them, which I don't. I'm still trying, now it's the weekend. have to wait now for Monday. I'll let you guys know the verdict. Thanks Guys"
