435452,archie_james_c,2010-02-22 02:10:00,618,"Ok, I'll admit it...I NEED the ice to go so I can haul some Walleye in!!! I threw some new harnesses together, revamped some old ones and changed the line on them. I need to go get some different colour beads and blades. My variety right now isn't much of a variety, more like a bunch of similar coloured colorado blades. Hooks by the way are Mustad Ultra-Point Octo-beaks in 6, 1/0 and 2/0 for trebles I use Eagle Claws almost exclusively.  Anyone have any suggestions for patterns?    Floaters    "
435512,tomO,2010-02-22 03:47:00,363,Nice looking rigs there. I gotta get some done too!
435514,BillM,2010-02-22 03:52:00,17367,"Those look great!  Are you working from a kit, or just by piecing them together?  I'd love to whip up a few of my own."
435517,tightline,2010-02-22 03:57:00,322,Very nice rigs...yeah are you working from a kit or is there a book on patterns....would be really interested
435519,archie_james_c,2010-02-22 04:01:00,618,All my stuff is from scratch. Thats another reason I posted...hopefully to get some veterans to share their patterns or secrets   .
435521,archie_james_c,2010-02-22 04:02:00,618, Its as easy as learning to tie a snell knot Bill!! and I find it a fun past time...
435524,pike slayer,2010-02-22 04:14:00,1177,so thats what you've been doing in your room all alone with the door shut
435530,BillM,2010-02-22 04:33:00,17367, Looks like I have something else to do for the spring time walleye bite
435535,young_one,2010-02-22 04:54:00,620,"Try those 'float pill' looking things behind the Colorado blade. I usually use my harness behind a walker type sinker, and I like the worm very buoyant and float above the bottom. Works well for less than 1.5 mph trolling or drifting. Adjust your weights accordingly.  loop----3 foot lead----[single bead][Colorado blade][single bead][float pill][single bead][#4 octopus hook] --2""--[#4 octopus hook]"
435536,uglyfish,2010-02-22 04:57:00,981,"no real patterns. lol, each day can be a different color pattern. it can change from hour to hour. i have tied... oh god... i dont know how many thousands of harnesses. i tied them for a tackle store, and i learned that anythin i tied would catch fish, obviously some colors worked better then others. ive tied some GOD AWFUL harnesses, and they caught fish... one i tied was so ugly it scared me... lol, but my buddy used it on erie and landed a 12lb walleye to win a tourney and made me tie 6 more for him. so a never know!"
435538,archie_james_c,2010-02-22 05:08:00,618, Yah one thing I've noticed so far is the Walleye I've caught don't seem to care about the pattern of beads on a spinner. I could put a Perch blade on one line with green/orange alternating beads and then the same blade on another line but with 3 green beads in a row followed by 3 orange ones and they are both going to produce the same amount of fish.  What I find more important (and harder) to do is find the hot colour on a new lake you've never fished before.
435540,bigugli,2010-02-22 05:21:00,6138,The big thing is keying the right colours to the colour of the water and the forage.
435554,denisk,2010-02-22 12:29:00,163,Those look good     When we fish lake erie or deeper waters the color is usually picked by the depth of water and light conditions.
435558,blaque,2010-02-22 13:03:00,2419, Glittery Polkadotted Float Pills Mmmmm Mmm  
435562,Roy,2010-02-22 13:21:00,13728,"Great job on the harnesses guys. I seldom have more than 2-3 pre-tied with me but I keep a small kit aboard to make  them as I need them. They only take but a minute or two to make and you can tweak them as conditions dictate. Works well for me, anyhow.  "
435583,Governator,2010-02-22 14:31:00,879,"How do you guys store them that are already made?  When I first started using them they would get tangled up with everything, then I started trying to put them back in the bags they came from.  That's a pain too when you just want to fish.  I can see if you make your own, but what if you're not just starting out with worm harnesses and just buying off the shelf?  Where do you put them heh."
435589,blaque,2010-02-22 14:46:00,2419,"I have just coiled them up and put into ziplocks..........ive wrapped them around a tube, i dunno........usually just bag them and try anfd be good about rebagging them at the end of a day if ive used a bunch of colors and have them whipped all over the boat lol"
435626,archie_james_c,2010-02-22 16:43:00,618,Heres my *little* setup. The snell holders are Lindy brand.   
435661,BillM,2010-02-22 18:34:00,17367,"Any specific places you guys pick up the blades, beads, floaters etc?"
435662,archie_james_c,2010-02-22 18:42:00,618,Bill I just get mine from my local shop. The good thing with that is you can talk to other fisherman and get their opinions on how to set-up harnesses...but first you gotta decipher what is Bull and what is truth   .  I found a good thread on another board on this topic...   http://www.michiganwalleye.com/forum/showt...d.php?p=3086971
435668,Roy,2010-02-22 18:59:00,13728,"I get almost all of my stuff from luremaking.com. As an added bonus, they're also a sponsor here. Have a look at their online catalogue. They also have tip sheets on how to build different baits. They're also based in Ontario."
435671,BillM,2010-02-22 19:09:00,17367,Thanks Roy!
435672,solopaddler,2010-02-22 19:09:00,8605, That's what I use as well to hold my snells. Pretty much standard.    Cabelas. Your head will explode when you see how much stuff they have.
435711,BillM,2010-02-22 21:25:00,17367,I guess I should have asked you after seeing your tacklebox
