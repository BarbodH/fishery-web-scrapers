436183,cheaptackle,2010-02-23 21:08:00,849,"You could try contacting the vendor (look for ask the seller a question option) to withdraw your bid. If all else fails, you could renege on payment & take a bad report post.  Not a good way to do it but if it's a last resort....  Michael"

436196,cheaptackle,2010-02-23 21:33:00,849,"Well.... I could also add that if I was INTO hockey I would have got it.  I'm really not, but once I figured it out, well, it's still a groaner!

After thinking it through (meaning I read it again along with the rest of the replies) I got it.  Actually is pretty funny when you take it the right way. You got me good, my hat's off to you!  And Vance, you do have a great sense of humour - you could have slapped me down for my reply but instead you seemed to have enjoyed it!  Cudos to you! Michael"
