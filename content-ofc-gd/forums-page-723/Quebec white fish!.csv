STEPHANIE... yet again... and this time  i wasent the only one JELOUSE!  we left at 6:30 am and on the way to 31 miles lake with the new snow on the pavement stephanie lost control and we ended up in the ditch!  good thing no other cars were comming because we crossed lanes .  we were lucky because only the back of the car went in the ditch ryan and i were able to lift and push the hyundai out of there!  FIEW!  get the the number one shoal @ 8:30  punch the holes and paul brakes the ice with his first white fish EVER!  yep took him 2 years to get one! :shock:    Congrats bird freak you deserve it!  i tie on the new spoon i just bought yesterday.  and i get into some action also!  punch a hole in 30-35 FOW...  stir the bottom up and BOOM!      sweet whitie!  this one is hooked deep in the eye... i mean trebbled gore eye socket style.  so i keep this one for super!  then i go to the MENS corner leave my rod on the ground... come back..  what do i see....  steph.... in my seat... with my rod.... in my hole......  im thinking .. ya know what she can have that hole i just pulled out the only whity in there anyways... :roll:  :roll:  bad decision! :x  2-3 jiggles.. FISH ON!     release the beast.  she puts the same lure in the same hole....  BANG. got em again!      well steph got all of us jelouse cause she got the frenzy on and it shut off to nothing after...  she pulles out 4 white fish back to back....  one  got unhooked at the hole and paul missed grabbing it. youl see the video once its done! its hilariouse.  we switch spots came back and the only thing that was bitting was on pauls line and they were OOS LA GRISE.  so we packed and called it a day!  6 white fish  were caught thats day.  note to self.  if steph shows up to fish.... leave the erea she WILL catch them all and leave nothing for the rest... shes just too damn GOOD!
