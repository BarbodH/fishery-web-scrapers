436412,archie_james_c,2010-02-24 04:25:00,618,I'm hoping to pair this reel up with a 7' Croix Legend Walleye 7' medium/moderate I plan to buy this week. Hopefully in a couple weeks I can give you guys my opinion on it along with some pics   .  EDIT- The Stradic Ci4 I am talking about...
436446,CLofchik,2010-02-24 11:31:00,854," I haven't had a single Shimano spinner last a season of King fishing, ever."
435915,tomO,2010-02-23 02:42:00,363,Anyone heard of them? I cant find any info on them but gander mountain has them for $100.00 off their regular price.
435922,JPD,2010-02-23 03:02:00,296,"Hi Mudbutt,  They are last year's models if they are the MgFB. Great reel, water proof drag, Paladin gearing, all the top features but since they brought out the new Ci4 Stradics they are blowing them out. Great deal at $100 off!  Here's a link to an online page that has all the details for you: Stradic MgFB  JP"
435923,trapshooter,2010-02-23 03:04:00,1234,"Wow, great deal!!  If I didn't already have 5 Stradics, I'd be taking advantage of that offer."
435924,tomO,2010-02-23 03:08:00,363,Thx JPD
436017,cranks bait,2010-02-23 14:48:00,721,"Ok now that you have my attention, where are these reels on sale?  Just checked out their site and saw them at regular price?  These are a great reel and I would scoop a couple at that price?"
436030,Fang,2010-02-23 15:20:00,1330,In store special. Saw them at Xmas in Buffalo and they only had stock of the 1000 and 500 size. I think it was $129 or something around that
436033,trapshooter,2010-02-23 15:24:00,1234,"1000 size is ideal for walleye, bass and I use my 1000 size on my my ice rods as well."
436043,BillM,2010-02-23 15:45:00,17367,Oh I could use one of those... I think I need to take a trip down there.
436055,solopaddler,2010-02-23 16:14:00,8605,  I went in the Buffalo Gander with Dave just before New Years and they were sold out. Better check first. I did pick up a 3000 MGFB on ebay for $90 last month though.
436060,BillM,2010-02-23 16:22:00,17367,I need something for pier chucking that can double for pike
436068,tomO,2010-02-23 16:33:00,363,"The instore adds were from my area Colubus ohio, charelston Wva., and washington Pa. They had revos to for $129.00"
436069,Syn,2010-02-23 16:34:00,519,I think a 2500 is sweet for bass or 3000/4000 for bigger pike would be good sizes.
436070,solopaddler,2010-02-23 16:35:00,8605," 4000 series Shimano, either Stradic or Sustain. I picked up a 4000 Sustain for just over $150 shipped on ebay last month as well."
436073,Syn,2010-02-23 16:40:00,519,"lol yeah love Ebay! Awesomely picked up a stradic 2500 Fi for $100+shipping and a decent muskie 8'6"" IM7 rod for $36+shipping, not to mention all the one of a kind painted muskie gliders."
436103,BillM,2010-02-23 17:57:00,17367," Yup, I'm thinking a 3000 would be about perfect.  20lb chrome kings tend to go on very long runs"
436104,Bondar,2010-02-23 18:03:00,817,"yea the 3000 is the way to go , same reel body as the 2500 just has a deeper spool for good long cast and long runs"
436105,Fang,2010-02-23 18:11:00,1330,"Hey Solo,  last week through the day there was a bunch of Stella's on ebay all ending around 3 pm. Had sizes from 1000 right up to 8000. About an hour before the end of the auction there were still a whack of them under $80. Darn it if my boss didn't drop by for a sit down ""brain stormin"" session. When he left it was 3:15 and I missed them all. Gee I hate being interrupted at work!!"
436119,solopaddler,2010-02-23 18:57:00,8605,  Stella's? Wow that's amazing. I never check for Stella's 'cause they're normally out of my price range.
436204,bassman,2010-02-23 21:47:00,384,"I still love the FH series (white ones). JPD, do you have any old ones to sell?"
436247,scugpg,2010-02-23 23:26:00,1373,They are a great reel! Especially on the prices they are clearing them out at!
436256,beertech,2010-02-23 23:40:00,118,does anyone else not like the tiny foam handle on the new c14.   I can;t see it not wearing out quickly number 1.  And why so tiny number 2.  I personaly and hooked on shimano and the 3000 paddle handles just don;t get this
436260,scugpg,2010-02-23 23:45:00,1373,"For those interested in the Stradic MGFB's in Ontario, give Jos a call at Angling Outfitters he has them on clearout at a great price last time I checked!"
436294,Syn,2010-02-24 00:24:00,519,+1 But I can't be absolutely sure its foam because I never held a CI4 (looks like foam though). The rubbery paddle handle I like even better than the old type round type wood handle. On my old stradics I would file down of both sides of the wood paddles and re-schlac them. pic
436299,tomO,2010-02-24 00:28:00,363,"My old stradic had a wooden handle too but it now lays at the bottom of the ohio river, thasnks to a very large fish hitting my chicken liver and launching it outa the boat, went about 8 or 10 feet before it hit the water, I about cried it was the first really nice rod and reel I ever bought"
436396,JPD,2010-02-24 03:35:00,296,"The new handle is EVA foam, same material they use on the Cumara and now Cumulus grips. Pretty durable stuff but I do agree that the 3000 handle is the cat's meow... the Septon grip is also great even when wet. There's a possibility that they may be bringing out a 3000 and 4000 Ci4 this coming year so keep your fingers crossed for the paddle.  JP"
