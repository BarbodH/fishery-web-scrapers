435574,danbouck,2010-02-22 14:09:00,4380,About the same as any other winds
435575,bushart,2010-02-22 14:16:00,2628,At the 1st onset of an east wind---fishing can actually be better  Generally once it's blowin a while I have found things to slow down a tad---probably that whole barometric thing accompanied by old rhymes  Bushart
435579,trevy727,2010-02-22 14:26:00,351,"i've caught some really big fish during an east wind, but they are few and far between. very low numbers of fish."
435584,ehg,2010-02-22 14:34:00,2666,"No doubt that prolonged east winds had a negative effect on the fish feeding on the Kawarthas. After many, many years i have seen it very often. Hard to get rock bass to bite on those days."
435883,irishfield,2010-02-23 02:05:00,26272,From the East .. brings out the Beast !
435889,Sinker,2010-02-23 02:11:00,8692,"East winds almost always bring weather with them. Its that weather that shuts the fish down, not really the wind direction.  S."
435967,Twocoda,2010-02-23 05:36:00,4130,For the lake huron coast in the tribs an east wind is highly favourable.....out on the lake things seem to shut  down....probably cuz no chop on the water...but it makes for a great boat ride
435971,cram,2010-02-23 06:19:00,1733,"east is least, west is best."
