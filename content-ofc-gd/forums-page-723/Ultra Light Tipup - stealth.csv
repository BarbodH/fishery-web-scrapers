435172,Leecher,2010-02-21 04:04:00,7832,Here's my latest creation for hard water.... been working at it all afternoon.... smallest tipup for any species of fish..... well almost anyways LOL  This will be used on my next outing..... rigged it with 8Lbs mono Trilene and a GCD special jig head I think this will get some attention under the ice.... check it out    Here it is next to a standard tipup    another    and this one    Enjoy!!!

435184,richyb,2010-02-21 06:02:00,774,"its not about the size of the stick, its how its balanced. My tip up in my hut is bigger than most but i have it balanced so soft that I can blow on it and it comes up nice. I have a good feeling about your rigs that they will catch fish."
435333,Leecher,2010-02-21 22:02:00,7832," Thanks richyb!!!  Very true about balance.... I have drilled 10 holes in the top for that, plus the reel has an adjustable knob for drag.... those are very sensitive, the slightest wind will make them tip"
435349,Fishing 24/7,2010-02-21 22:17:00,709,WOW JAQUES!  when i think you thought of everything !

435353,Syn,2010-02-21 22:25:00,519,Great Job JAQUES. You have an good idea and then make it happen. The tip up looks like its ready to be sold in stores.
435376,Leecher,2010-02-21 23:08:00,7832, Thanks Kev!!!  This one is the most compaq yet..... will fit nicely into the 5 gallon bucket The reel was purchased at Techniques Chasse PÃªche a couple of years ago.... can't get braid on there cause the spool is too small but good for mono    Thanks Syn!!!  It sure does

435516,BillM,2010-02-22 03:55:00,17367,"Jacques, these would rock for those finicky Simcoe whitefish!!!  Awesome job man, they look outstanding!!"
435518,tightline,2010-02-22 04:00:00,322,Looks like anther grand slam Leechman...sweet looking little rig...could have used an 8 pack of those on the weekend!!
435721,Leecher,2010-02-22 21:44:00,7832, Thanks Bill!!!  Small and light was the thinking behind this smaller version.... The drag knob of the reel and 10 adjustable holes brings sensitivity..... mono brings stealth to the presentation under the ice   Thanks tightline!!!
