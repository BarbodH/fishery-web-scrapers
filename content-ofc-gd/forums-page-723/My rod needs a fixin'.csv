436395,Skud,2010-02-24 03:33:00,739,"I have a great Pikin' rod that had a little mishap when I was up north with Solopaddler catching big Gators. The plastic end cap fell off the cork handle(which I lost) so as the week progressed the cork started to break up. The handle was constantly in contact with my body for support since I was casting large Bucktails all day which caused the breaking. The cork broke right up to the rod blank which hurts my hip when retrieving in a lure since it has sharp edges. The rod is a Shimano (Bob Izumi Signature Series) and about 6 years old. Is it covered under warranty? If not, can this be fixed?  I really like this rod and want to salvage it if possible. Any help is appreciated.  "
436397,solopaddler,2010-02-24 03:41:00,8605,"Those pike were vicious weren't they?  Easy fix Doug. Buy a $2 butt cap and measure it against the end of your rod. Carefully cut away the cork with a razor blade and clean it off the end of the blank. Tape up the exposed bit of rod blank with masking tape and glue the new butt cap on. Sand the cork so it's as even as possible with the new butt cap. If there's any gaps take some of the cork dust, mix it with a bit of white glue, fill in the cracks and sand.   (Or just do what I'd do and buy a new more expensive rod.  )"

436401,Skud,2010-02-24 03:51:00,739,"Thanks Mike, but who sells a good assortment of butt caps so I can get one that is a close match to mine?  Oh, and I am certainly not done buying more great Pike rods."
436405,solopaddler,2010-02-24 03:59:00,8605,"Butt caps for freshwater rods are pretty much standard in diameter. There's a place in Midland that sells components, Backwater Tackle (I think?). Angling Specialties on hwy.7 just south of Bass Pro would be another source.  Of course there's countless online sources for rod components as well. Google is your friend."
436411,archie_james_c,2010-02-24 04:19:00,618,"I vote you strip the old cork off, sleeve on a new ass end and make it a split grip handle!!!"
436429,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-02-24 04:55:00,1107,Call shimano should be covered under warranty pretty sure they have a lifetime over the counter warranty but its been 6 years since mine burnt up in a house fire they wouldn't waranty that.
436431,Skud,2010-02-24 05:01:00,739,  What is a split grip handle?
436432,archie_james_c,2010-02-24 05:03:00,618,  
436433,Skud,2010-02-24 05:06:00,739,Interesting......but I don't see the advantage.
436434,archie_james_c,2010-02-24 05:07:00,618, Um....its cooler????  Just a change in pace is all
436449,cheaptackle,2010-02-24 11:45:00,849,"Not my idea but a fast & cheap method - take the rod to Home Depot (or equivalent) & find a chair leg cap that fits.  Glue it on.  Done. I never had to do it myself, but I did see it on a couple of musky rods  - seemed to be just fine, the owner was happy with it. Michael"
436451,aplumma,2010-02-24 11:59:00,6896," The split grip lets you feel the rod blank without the cork. We use them when worm fishing or jigging so you can feel the pickup or what the bottom is doing. Spooled with power pro I have seen people call out rocks, branches and even what the bottom is made of correctly. It's a good tool if you are one of the gifted people.  Art"
436452,Spiel,2010-02-24 12:01:00,9065,PM me your home address Doug and I'll send you a butt cap.
436464,solopaddler,2010-02-24 13:08:00,8605,  Yeah but who's holding the blank behind the reel anyway? The split rear grip seems pointless to me other than for aesthetic reasons. The little bit of cork you're eliminating weighs virtually nothing so it's not a weight issue.
436478,Skud,2010-02-24 14:02:00,739,"Remember I use this rod for fishing Pike. I really only use it to throw 3/8 to 1 ounce spinner baits and bucktails and I have 50lb braid on the reel.  I can feel a Gator hit just fine the way it is. Just need a nice round, smooth cap so it does not dig into me. "
436499,Spiel,2010-02-24 14:31:00,9065,"Doug, Doug, DOUG, pay attention.  I have what you're looking for as seen here.  I have all three sizes just let me know which one you want (measure the cork diameter)."
436517,Skud,2010-02-24 15:11:00,739,Thanks Chris.
436518,BillM,2010-02-24 15:13:00,17367,Doug.....those are monsters.    
436520,Spiel,2010-02-24 15:22:00,9065, You're very welcome.
436541,Skud,2010-02-24 16:18:00,739, Be nice Bill. Those are just the small ones from the Cook's Bay spring opener to take home for dinner.  These guys go back in.
