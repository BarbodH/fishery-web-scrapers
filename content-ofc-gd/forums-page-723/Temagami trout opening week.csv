435930,switchback,2010-02-23 03:14:00,10,Just got back from the opening week of fishing at lake temagami for trout.  They were biting but not that well.  They just would not hold on but by the end of the week they were getting better.  Hope who ever goes up next has better luck.  Good luck to all cause we certainly did not hurt the population lol.
435936,irishfield,2010-02-23 03:27:00,26272,You do have to set the hook ! lol  Monday to Thursday were great... shut down Friday through Monday.. but even in that period we still managed a few fish.
435943,switchback,2010-02-23 03:51:00,10,We did okay but nothing like last year.  We ended up using stingers to get the trout and then that was okay but they sure were not hitting hard.  Our biggest for the week was 10.5 pounds sure cant seem to find the monsters that we know are there
435945,irishfield,2010-02-23 03:54:00,26272,Yep.. a lot of short hits.. we trimmed the tails/frills etc off our baits and had stingers on a few designs we were using.  One of these years we have to have a G2G at half lake or something! lol There were other OFC'rs up there as well... I called one of them from the ice on Kokoko on Thursday... just to tell him how much fun I was having pulling Lakers and 'eye's up through his holes... while he was still working in the big smoke at the time! lol  Our monster this year... estimate 43 lbs... a 4 footer!
