436230,Billy Bob,2010-02-23 22:37:00,5865," YOU have to be kidding...RIGHT....if not check on the stats of the game alone if you didn't see it....MILLER IS THE MAN without question.....I was being realistic as most of the game was played in the USA end of the ice.....if there is another MILLER TIME if and when USA and Canada play against each other again, well get out you hankies.....but I will repeat, without another MILLER TIME Team Canada is Superior to any of the other teams....relax and enjoy the hockey games..you should enjoy yourself.....BUT.........  Bob"
