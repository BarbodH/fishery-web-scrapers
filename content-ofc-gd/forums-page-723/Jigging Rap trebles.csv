435720,crappieperchhunter,2010-02-22 21:41:00,2582,"I use #2 and #3 size jigging rapalas for perch in the winter. My go to weapon of choice as a matter of fact. This winter I have had the bottom treble come off on 3 separate occasions on me. The gap on the top where the hook is attached sometimes is a little wide and the fish can actually shake it off. I have gotten into the habit of pinching the gap with some pliers before I go out so I probably will not donate anymore trebles. However I am having a heck of a time finding small trebles to replace on my 3 ""Bare"" rapalas.  It would be nice if Rapala solved this problem or made replacement hooks more readily available. Until then if anyone knows a source for small replacement trebles I would be grateful for any help."
435723,Mike Pike,2010-02-22 21:47:00,1332,I've had the same problem with my jiggin' raps too.  I have several 'bare' ones just waiting for the right size treble when I find em.  I'm always surprised how a company like Rapala can make such a common mistake.  Oh well..
435728,cheaptackle,2010-02-22 22:01:00,849,Would I be breaking any rules if I recommend a source that is not my own business? Michael
435730,crappieperchhunter,2010-02-22 22:05:00,2582, Myself I would be grateful for any help. BTW I fish perch big time in the fall in the uptergrove neck of the woods
435735,cheaptackle,2010-02-22 22:17:00,849,"PM Sent. Fall is good but so is the Orillia Perch Festival (starts in April, around the 3rd weekend I believe).  Great way to warm up for the main season opener! Michael"
435795,buckster,2010-02-22 23:26:00,530,"I had the same problem with my jigging raps Steve,and also with the fine wire hooks on my chubby darters always breaking off.   I picked up a few packs of mustad trebles.   Problem solved.    Small sizes are not that easy to find mind you!"
435798,crappieperchhunter,2010-02-22 23:27:00,2582, Where did you find the small trebles Tony?
435814,Rob,2010-02-23 00:04:00,467,"ahh come on guys, it's gonna benefit all of us! Tell us where!  Rob C"
435818,cheaptackle,2010-02-23 00:13:00,849,Now that I've seen it posted in another thread I guess it's ok - I suggested luremaking.com to crappieperchhunter - minimum quantities might be involved but a couple guys could get together & make it happen. Michael
435831,bigugli,2010-02-23 00:34:00,6138,I could order a bunch for folks next time i put in my order for parts. What size exactly? Smallest I found is a size 14 Eagle Claw
435833,solopaddler,2010-02-23 00:40:00,8605,If it was me I'd be putting one size larger treble on them anyway. The stock hooks are too small.
435862,crappieperchhunter,2010-02-23 01:23:00,2582,  Like I said I fish these alot. The hooks maybe small but the stock hooks have a nice fine point..perfect for tipping maggots with. Most small hooks if not thin or sharp enough can really butcher a maggot. My perfect solution would be getting the exact hooks from rapala.
436095,Leecher,2010-02-23 17:36:00,7832,If it was me I'd replace them with Excalibur..... CTC and Walmart carries them Leechman
436109,Raf,2010-02-23 18:37:00,3495,lebaron would probably have them too.. i am guessing #8 size treble.
436133,cheaptackle,2010-02-23 19:20:00,849,"Just thought of it - Place just south of the 401 near you called ""Gagnon's"" I believe - if they're still there I'd bet they have a selection that should find you what you need.  Haven't been in it for decades, but I seem to remember still being able to see it from the highway.  Shoot me a p.m. if you're still stuck, I have a bunch of damaged stock I might be able to pull the hooks off if they're the right size for you. Michael"
436136,Headhunter,2010-02-23 19:26:00,5703,"I've had the same problem with Jiggin Raps and I end up just taking a treble off of an un-productive lure in a pinch. I too, use a Jiggin Rap for perch and my biggest beef with them is the clear plastic tail breaking off of them for no apparent reason... I bought a new one this year and it only last one outing... reeling it in to find the plastic tail was gone... pretty crappy quality for such a productive and expensive bait. HH"
436137,solopaddler,2010-02-23 19:26:00,8605,If you're dead set on the tiny trebles and can't find them anywhere just buy a handful of small stinger hooks for jigs and cut the treble off.
436228,crappieperchhunter,2010-02-23 22:32:00,2582,I've received alot of PM's and suggestions here from many of you. A couple have suggested using stingers and I think that would be my option of choice once I check some out to see if they will work for me. Truthfully I have tons of these jigs so it could be years...or never...before it could really be a problem.  It does however seem that Rapala has a problem here that should be addressed.  Thanx to all for taking the time to offer your help.
436283,sirfish,2010-02-24 00:14:00,175,I find the Mustad  3550R  #12 or #10 in blood red are awesome for the jigging raps .I tie them in a stinger fashion with fleuro  about an inch below. that way it hangs much like the nils master jigging rap
436341,crappieperchhunter,2010-02-24 01:19:00,2582,Sounds like a good idea. I picked up some hali dropper hooks to try as well on my raps. Haven't actually had them out for a swim yet though.
