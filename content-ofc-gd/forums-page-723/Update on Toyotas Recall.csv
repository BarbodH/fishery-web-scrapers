All are running perfectly - the only repair in the last 5 years has been one brake job and an O2 sensor on the Camry and some headlights.  Crap car.  On these three cars we've put about 450k km over these 5 years.  No batteries, ball joints, radiators, alternators, mufflers, transmissions, shocks, starters, modules of any kind.  No plugs, cables, brake lines, air conditioners.  Even all the power stuff still works.  I know that this proves nothing - it's called 'confirmation bias', but it's been my best 5 years in operating cars.  The Subarus also sound like great vehicles."

A car literally having its paint peel off.  Yup, they have always been a domestic.  As far as Toyota going down hill, only the big three can ever hope.  Once Toyota sorts out this part that is defective (Made In Mississauga) all will be well.  By the way,I own an 09 Corolla."

I'm   glad my employer is trying to fix this as quickly as possible and bieng as upfront as they can be (due to class action suit filed against them). I have a feeling this will turn out for the better for toyota in the long run because of the HUGE focus on saftey and quality in the assembly departments hopefully resulting in some more quality awards for Canadian made Toyota  vehicles."

429464,Jonny,2010-02-04 15:59:00,1380," Yes, there obviously is a problem. But in the manner of a lot of news nowadays, it's hyped up extensively.  It's probably hard to separate fact and fiction in a claim that a gas pedal got stuck because of a faulty part. You can bet some claims will use that excuse to cover up driver error.  Even that stuff about the floor mat creeping forward and getting stuck under the gas pedal --- people should notice stuff like that but they don't pay attention. I noticed it in my old Matrix until I had the floor mats clipped in properly (there are clips in a Matrix to hold them in place - I assume those clips are in other Toyotas as well).  When I traded in my first Matrix to buy the 2010 model, I kept the rubber floor mats that go over the fabric ones. They used to clip in ""doubled up"" in the old car, but the design changed ever so slightly, so in the new car I had to remove the fabric mats so the rubber ones would clip in and hold.  I've never owned a Big 3 vehicle that even had floor mat clips.  I wonder how much of the ""floor mat problem"" (the other aspect of the Toyota discussion) is simply because people just get in a car, turn the key and go. That would be typical, just like people get in and go without clearing their rear-view mirrors, back license plates, snow off the roof, stuff like that.  Sloppy, good enough, let's go.  People buy non-OEM floor mats all the time. Has anybody ever sued a manufacturer because they didn't pay attention and they slipped out of place? Not that I've ever heard."

I wasn't sure I was affected by the recall but I assumed I was. As soon as I had heard that the recalls and repairs were to start, I called the dealer, booked an appointment...no waiting, it was handled very efficiently at Duval Toyota in Boucherville. I drove the car to the dealership and they drove me home. Two hours later, they called me back to say that the car was ready and that if it was ok with me, they'd pick me up to drive me to the dealership to pickup the car. They arrived on the dang minute they said they would...drove me to the dealership...I walked in, they gave me the certificate and my keys, told me which number parking spot I was at and I was on my way. Absolutely painless and scary efficient. I'm a happy dude... ESPECIALLY that it's J's car and I know that I don't have to worry. Did I say they washed the car too?  Good stuff."

They didn't wash the truck though as it was already cleaned on the outside. So they vacuumed the inside instead!  This was done at Vandemeer Toyota in Cobourg. I bought the truck at Clairington Toyota.  I am one happy camper for the service you get with Toyota. Definitely this is what was missing with Ford.

My F150 is now 7 years old now..the local Ford dealer still washers it everytime it's in for service, or an oil change, and each time I'm in I request and they give me a loaner car that I can drive anywhere I want with.. even if that meant I'd planned on heading to Winterpeg that day! Truck is in once every 6 or 7 thousand KM's. It has needed nothing but normal service and an exhaust manifold in 123,000 km and 7 years."

I don't care about all these recalls because my Toyotas are considerably older models and were made in Japan not North America. Say what you will but my 1994 and 1997 are still going strong. How many Fords, Chryslers and Chevs can you say that about?"

The service manager told me, ""We checked, and you're good to go til we get the replacement.""  I said, ""So the car is safe to drive?""  He said, ""If it weren't, you wouldn't be leaving here.

427203,craigdritchie,2010-01-29 14:18:00,1586,"This is a pretty damning article from today's Torstar wire service. I'd be willing to bet Torstar ran this through their legal department before publishing it, because if the author can't prove he is 100 percent dead-on with his facts, both he and Torstar will be in court with Toyota for years to come.   The Myth of Toyota Quality  Rush to growth sacrificed the product January 29, 2010 David Olive Torstar News Service  My friend Mary Lou in Michigan knows that Toyota's reputation for quality is a sham. On a recent visit, she swept her arm across the width of the dashboard of her year-old Camry, bought new. ""Every piece of this trim has fallen off or warped,"" she said of America's best-selling car.  An analyst at J.D. Power and Associates, the sine qua non in rating vehicle quality, told The Canadian Press Wednesday Toyota's recall of 2.3 million vehicles in the U.S. and 270,000 in Canada ""signifies that (Toyota is) not afraid of doing the right thing for the right reasons, that short-term sales and profits are less important than taking care of the consumer and making sure they're safe in Toyota vehicles.''  I'd argue that not one word of that is true.  To start with, Toyota took the extraordinary step this week of suspending production at three U.S. and its two Canadian assembly plants because it was forced to by U.S. law. ""It's not a voluntary thing,"" Toyota spokesman Mike Michels told the Wall Street Journal Wednesday.  More important, Toyota's quality problems go back many years, before the latest recall and last year's massive 4.2-million vehicle recall.  As it embarked on a goal of becoming the world's biggest automaker, Toyota failed to insulate itself from the ""big-company disease"" that humbled General Motors Co. As Toyota quickly ramped up production of its vehicles, its employees strayed from the automaker's ""Toyota Way"" of exacting quality control and continuous improvement in manufacturing methods.  It almost had to turn out that way. By 2007 Toyota was adding an average of two new factories a year to its global network, including a second Canadian plant in Woodstock that opened in 2008. Toyota's annual volume growth of about 500,000 vehicles equalled the entire production of Ford Motor Co.'s Volvo brand. By that same year, some 200,000, or two-thirds, of Toyota's workforce was located outside Japan. Toyota could no longer rely on word of mouth to convey the firm's managerial and manufacturing methods.  From 2004 to 2007, Toyota recalled a staggering 9.3 million vehicles – a number exceeding its total annual output, and up from 2.5 million recalls in the three years previous to 2004. In 2005, Toyota's rate of recalls as a percentage of vehicles on the road hit 10.1 per cent, compared with 6.8 per cent from GM and 2.5 per cent at Chrysler Group.  In 2006, Tokyo censured Toyota over improper business practices for failing for eight years to disclose and act on reports of a design flaw implicated in loss-of-control incidents. Loss of control due to accelerator pedals caught under floor mats triggered last year's huge recall, and caused four deaths after a Lexus abruptly went off the road in California.  In the 2007 J.D. Power survey, the Toyota brand scored below that of Hyundai Motor Co., a firm better known for price than quality. And the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety withheld its ""top-pick"" rating from Toyota's Camry and RAV4 SUV after their substandard performance in whiplash tests.  Also in 2007, Toyota's U.S. division settled a class-action lawsuit brought by motorists claiming that oil-sludge buildup destroyed their engines despite compliance with Toyota's maintenance guidelines.  A long three years ago, then-CEO Katsuaki Watanabe acknowledged to reporters that Toyota's long run of shoddiness was jeopardizing the company. ""The world-class quality that we've built is our lifeline.""  Yet, despite opening two quality ""institutes"" in each of North America and Europe to inculcate the ""Toyota Way,"" there has been no meaningful improvement in Toyota quality. Like GM, stuck with too many plants as its market share dropped in half, Toyota has been compelled to keep all its new plants running flat-out to generate the cash flow to finance their construction, even as customer complaints have mounted.  Unlike Honda, Toyota is not an engineering trailblazer. And no one would accuse Toyota of being a trendsetter in styling akin to, say, BMW. Quality is principally what Toyota offers the market.  Toyota realized its goal of eclipsing GM as the world's largest automaker last year. The goal was a dubious one, given the risks. In any case, by late last year, Toyota had been overtaken by Volkswagen.  The only thing saving Toyota is a decades-long reputation for quality that people who still buy its cars don't realize the firm has not lived up to for more than half a decade."

That can be a bit of a trap.  My opinion that Toyotas are better than Big 3 cars I have owned is based on comparing relatively new Toyotas to Big 3 vehicles that I have owned going right back to the 1970's. I have little first hand experience concerning the build of Big 3 vehicles for the past 7 years or so.  What I do know is that I bought a second Matrix after owning my first one because in the years of ownership of the first one, not one thing went wrong - not one. Nothing broke, nothing fell off, nothing wore out, and regular maintenance at the dealership was an efficient and pleasant experience.  Now maybe I could have gotten that with a newer Big 3 car from a Big 3 dealer, I don't know. (By all indications the Big 3 are building better cars than they used to.) What I do know is that I'm not going to pull the plug on my opinion of Toyotas based on a recall that has received a lot of publicity and comment that is at times almost gleefully critical of Toyota."

428236,Sinker,2010-02-01 04:58:00,8692,"  Its worth it for what i get out of it though. I can travel most ATV trails without even spinning a wheel, snowy roads are a pleasure to drive on, and once I get off the trail and hit the pavement, I can blow away most other rice burners  I was sceptical at first, but so far, the forester has been unstoppable, and I've had it in some crazy places!! It tows my boat just fine too, so I can't complain at all.  I'm getting around 500km/60L tank of premium, so its still not bad for what you get. Comparable to most V-6 motors with similar HP, but with the best AWD technology going.  S."

If you own one of these vehicles, call your dealer and get it serviced asap! This isn't about bashing any one brand, but presented in the interest of safety. Copied verbatim from an AP press release. No word on any action by Canadian dealers. CR   TOYOTA SUSPENDS SALE OF VEHICLES INVOLVED WITH ACCELERATOR RECALL  TORRANCE, Calif. — Toyota is suspending U.S. sales of eight recalled vehicle models to fix accelerator pedals that stick.  As part of the plan, Toyota is halting production at five manufacturing facilities for the week of Feb. 1 “to assess and co-ordinate activities.”  There are 2.3 million vehicles involved in the recall, which was announced last week.  The Japanese automaker says the sales suspension includes the 2009-2010 RAV4, the 2009-2010 Corolla, the 2009-2010 Matrix, the 2005-2010 Avalon, the 2007-2010 Camry, the 2010 Highlander, the 2007-2010 Tundra and the 2008-2010 Sequoia.  The recall came months after Toyota recalled 4.2 million vehicles due to gas pedals that could become trapped under floor mats, causing the vehicle to accelerate."

426307,DanD,2010-01-27 14:57:00,2223,"All of the parent off-shore auto manufacturers have been playing this game for a long time.   It’s about time they’ve been called on their “defects”; it’s just too bad people had to get hurt, before they stepped up and openly took responsibility. I know a number of techs that work for some of these companies and they were constantly repairing defects on vehicles. Vehicles that were brought in for basic service work (oil change) and the defect repaired without owner’s knowledge; just to keep their shinny reputation. Point being their vehicles now, are no better then the former big three.  Dan."

426336,Jonny,2010-01-27 16:52:00,1380,"I called the local Toyota dealer and I was told that despite Toyota Canada not having issued recall letter yet, they would be happy to take in my 2010 Matrix right away and check the accelerator linkage to see if there is any problem.  Can't ask for much more than that.  It sounds to me like a lot of the press that Toyota is getting about this potential problem is pretty overblown, considering the high-quality build of their cars. I'm on my second Matrix, the first one was so good."
426341,lookinforwalleye,2010-01-27 17:28:00,4399,"  Ya overblown but so what every time a domestic manufacturer farts it`s gets disected and slammed so I think whats good for the goose is good for the gander.  I have owned 2 Japanesse cars opps sorry 3 I was not going to count the first made in Japan car I owned because  the body bio degraded right in front of my eyes so quickly there probably would not have been enough of the car to bring back , anyways with the last 2 Japan cars I have had 3 recalls and the too numerous domestics I have owned over the years I have had 1 recall."

426458,splashhopper,2010-01-27 22:37:00,2931,  Did you ever drive a Dodge caravan?  I never got any recalls either....  but on both of the Grand Caravans I have.... I have had to replace:  Starters... front strut towers... AC condensers ... .... power steering racks.... clocksprings in the steering column... rear door hatch regulators....  These two vans are the same models and the vehicles are 5 years apart in age....  Makes u wonder why the same parts go on these eh ?  ..

426489,holdfast,2010-01-27 23:52:00,1813,"   I just talked to my dealer face to face and you both hit it on the nail according to my dealer in Saskatchewan. Monday it goes in and they will check the mats to ensure that they are original Toyota, and no extra matting underneath, as well as they are pinned to the two floor hooks.  He will also test the pedal, they have some sort of instrument that will test the press and depress pressure.  Apparently the problem with the pedal is once you take your foot off the pedal it sticks or decelerates abnormally slowly.  There are the two different manufacturers and yes it is the Toronto/Mississauga part that is the culprit.  His test requires testing once then letting the car sit for two hours then doing a second time.  If it passes, we are good to go unless Toyota decides to replace the part anyways.  I heard both good and bad about the company because of this.  Since they have been outstanding in the past I will believe the good comment.  Toyota is unique in that it is recalling all their vehicles because it is against their Culture and Mission Statement not to knowingly sell defective cars. I give them kudus to completely stop any further manafacturing till it is corrected.  I Never heard the Big Three doing that.  Remember when this exact thing happened to Audi.  It near killed their North American Market and later it was found out there was no problem however they never the less spread their Break and Gas pedals further apart any ways."
426527,sirfish,2010-01-28 01:29:00,175,"Sooooooooooooooooo, what are all the Toyota owners going to do when the problem in fact doesn't go away after the pedal replacement...oh yah, go faster. Funny, talking to a friend who works in the cambridge vacility today, he says  the Streetsville CTS manufactured part is exactly the same as the one from its parent company....Hmmm  and wonders why they would put it in 4million cars if it was in fact the problem, which he is very sceptical about. If it turns out this does fix the problem then its a design issue not CTS."

426567,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-01-28 02:51:00,1107,  This is completely the supplier not a design issue the bushing in the pedal is causeing it to release slowly I looked at one today and let's face it they have to much to loose with this they have no choice but to fix the problem to protect their good name and yes I am a employee and believe I build quality vehicles.
