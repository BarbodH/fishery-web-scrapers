432267,Bondar,2010-02-11 17:10:00,817,"i have a lowrance x67c ice machine , would someone be able to tell me if its possible to go from a 7amph to a bigger say 20amph motorcycle battery or will it damage the unit?  thanks in advance for any info Jeff"
432271,Fisherman,2010-02-11 17:17:00,7201,"No damage will occur, the X67 only takes as much power as is needed, the battery doesn't ""feed"" the unit.  A 7A battery should do about 3 days, I've got a 12V 12A battery that goes pretty much a week before recharging is needed although it gets done after each day to properly maintain it."
432276,johnnyb,2010-02-11 17:28:00,3413,"I would think that's right, so long as you have the 3 amp fuse wired in....?"
432279,Bondar,2010-02-11 17:32:00,817,yup fuse is there
432303,motion,2010-02-11 18:48:00,403,"No damage will come to the unit, however, why are you looking for such a large reserve capacity? Is it because you have one lying around and want to use it? I purchased an extra 12 volt 7ahr from Radioworld for $30.00. I charge a couple of them and use one as spare. Lasts 2 long days on a charge for my X102."
432312,Bondar,2010-02-11 19:12:00,817,"yea i have one sitting here so i was just curious and my old battery is no good anymore , are there any stores maybe close to Niagara region anyone can think of to pick one of these up?"
432322,Terry,2010-02-11 19:57:00,14456,just make sure you use a gel or Absorbed Glass Mat battery if you use a regular battery and it spills say goodbye to you finder

432338,Fang,2010-02-11 20:47:00,1330,Hey Bondar  I use a 12aH now that I purchases at Magnacharge in Mississauga for $43. Running a color Humminbird for ice fishing and after a full day hardly budged the voltage. They do sell a 20aH battery for only a couple bucks more but I found it really heavy and it is double wide over the typical 7aH
432390,danbouck,2010-02-11 23:04:00,4380, I use to get all my batteries from them and they have good prices
432434,Bondar,2010-02-12 00:20:00,817,thanks for the info everyone !!!!!!
434486,cityfisher,2010-02-18 14:56:00,959,just picked one up from AA Electronics in Sauga... 18.95 for 7 amp
