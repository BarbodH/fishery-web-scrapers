436584,anders,2010-02-24 18:22:00,1168,"I use ebay a lot, and i always see cheap prices on stuff that is located or says its located in Hong Kong.  Ususally see an item in bulk and has a ridiculously cheap price attached to it.  Does anyone know what the deal is with this? Is it legit, or scam?  Just curious, thanks"
436589,Harrison,2010-02-24 18:39:00,2202,"Be careful, usually knock offs and even if the pricing is really good, look at the shipping!  However, this is where alot of lures are manufactured, so the could just have really really good pricing, or they are the defects!"
436591,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-24 18:45:00,10439,I have never had issues buying from China on ebay. In fact I seem to get faster delivery than the States!!! Yesterday I ordered a spare battery and charger for my new digicam for $12 delivered. We'll see how long it takes this order to get here. I'll probably see it next week.
436597,jayess,2010-02-24 18:52:00,187,"As others have noted, I think it depends on what you buy...  Would I buy name-brand clothing? No. In fact, you can find several eBay guides on how to detect fake items -- in my interest was Arc'Teryx clothing.  I have bought several camera filters (B+W), Canon lens accessories, and laptop AC adaptors without issue. Most of these include free shipping and tend to be noted as 'gift' by the sellers, without my requesting so.  In the end, be smart about it. If it's too good to be true (i.e. savings of over $100), it probably is."

436607,Raf,2010-02-24 19:10:00,3495,i've ordered electronics (cell phone supplies) and tattoo stuff from china and it's the real deal with really fast shipping to boot (quicker than from the US).  never an issue.  your mileage may vary.
436616,solopaddler,2010-02-24 19:37:00,8605,Doesn't make much of a difference since buyers are protected pretty well on ebay. There's not much of a risk.
436620,Hud,2010-02-24 19:52:00,140,some of it is knock off some refurbished.  I've had great luck just be careful to the point made earlier in that sometimes the price is great only to see REALLY high shipping and handeling charges
436622,Marko,2010-02-24 19:55:00,854,"If you want to know more about the seller and whether the stuff he or she is selling is fake or not just read some of the comments that other buyers have left. I bought stuff from China, mostly electronics tho. So far so good! Good luck!"
436623,bare foot wader,2010-02-24 19:58:00,1354,"I also read as much as possible on the seller's history and customer feedback, look for any previous complaints....a lot of knock offs out there, esp for clothing....but things like electronics I've saved 300-400 before on genuine product, saved some decent coin, 100+ of fishing and mountain biking stuff too....be smart about it, do some research, don't bid unless you feel good about it"
