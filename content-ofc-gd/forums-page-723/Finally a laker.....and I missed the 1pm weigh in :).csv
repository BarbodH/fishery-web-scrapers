I ended up driving back to 9th and making a haul from there.  Two quick whities and before you know it, it was time to come in..   On the way back I just had a feeling and had to drop the transducer down and take a look.  My suspicions were right as I started marking fish right away.  I look around and not a soul in sight..  Gotta love that.    The fish loved to come up and take a quick look then back down to the bottom.. This was the trend for most of the day..  Finally I dropped my BadBoy + white tube jig down on the bottom, stirred some silt up and let it sit there for a good 30 seconds.  Thinking that lure wasn't the one, I started to reel up real quick and this fish rockets from the bottom and absolutely smashes it.  The rod buckles over and I think I have a whitefish from hell on... Pulling drag, direction changes...what did I have on?   I get a quick peek down the hole after 15mins and what do I see?  Mr Lake Trout!!  w00t!    Got him out of the hole, he posed for a few pics and back down he went..  Not a monster by any means, but a lot of fun out of 100+ feet of water.  I apologize for missing the 1pm weighin time, I was looking forward to meeting some of you fellas..   "

435590,BillM,2010-02-22 14:58:00,17367,"TJ, I made it back to IBP at around 2:30 or so, but I got off the lake at 9th, the same way I went out.  If you saw a black S10 ZR2 with GLoomis stickers on the back, that was me"

435783,BillM,2010-02-22 23:07:00,17367,"Jacques, I think I picked the wrong sport!!   I'll keep my limit of whitefish (2) for my oldman and any jumbo perch I catch, but those lakers are too pretty not to let go."
435800,Leecher,2010-02-22 23:30:00,7832,Very true Bill.... trout are the most beautiful fish of all species
436007,MJL,2010-02-23 14:07:00,2427,"Well done Bill  My last 4 trips to Simcoe (Pretty much the last 4 weekends), the lakers have been eluding my friends and I.  Good to see at least somebody catching to give us the hope we need to continue on  We've been getting pwnd the last 5 weeks by a fish with a brain the side of a pea"
