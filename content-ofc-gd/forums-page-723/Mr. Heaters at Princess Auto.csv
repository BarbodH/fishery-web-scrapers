They unfortunately don't have any of the mid size Buddy heaters. Those are great prices for these units and a good time to grab them if you need them (I did!!).  Also, they have telescoping shovels for $3.49 that make a great portable hut shovel.  Cheers!"

436495,motion,2010-02-24 14:28:00,403,"It doesn't show up in the flyer. It caught me totally by surprise as well. They are at the back of the store in two piles clearly marked. When I got to the cash, they had to over ride the price but they gave it to me for 59.99. Better go quick before they take the signs down."
