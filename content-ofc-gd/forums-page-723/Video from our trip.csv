436458,Spiel,2010-02-24 12:32:00,9065,Tank !
436536,ehg,2010-02-24 16:08:00,2666,"Nice ice fishing trip! That big laker must be 25-30 lbs Great video, thanks for posting it."
436571,irishfield,2010-02-24 17:39:00,26272,The laker calculator puts it between 41 and 43 lbs... here's a similar fish that was kept and weighed in at 43 lbs. I think Lloyd's fish was slightly longer than this one. None of us really care what it weighs... it will be hard to beat in years to come for sure.. but gives us a goal ! lol  
436015,Terry,2010-02-23 14:45:00,14456,here are some videos of the guys fishing at the 3 minute mark it gets exciting  when you hear me saying bleep..it's to hide the more colorful words
