805533,davis,2013-08-29 17:19:00,128,"I've had my 50"" plasma (Samsung)  in the basement up until we moved to a new home a couple of months ago. It's now in the main floor living room, which gets a lot of natural light and is quite bright during the day. Key is that the windows are on the same wall as the TV - so as long as there's no direct light hitting the screen, plasma is totally fine. Glare/reflection is a plasma tv's kyrptonite. The overall brightness of the room hasn't impacted the picture quality at all.  +2 on the power consumption/heat - it does get pretty warm. not as efficient as an LCD/LED.  I'll be in market for another tv later in the fall, for the basement, and I'll definitely be getting another plasma."

805595,danc,2013-08-30 00:10:00,4677,"My LCD recently crapped out on me, so I did some research (on a tv junkie forum, not on a fishing forum) and ended up with a Panasonic plasma. The die hards there liked plasma probably 10 to 1 over LCD/LED. That surprised me a bit, but that's the way I went and I'm very happy with my choice."
805793,bow slayer,2013-08-31 07:15:00,1074,"nothing beats the picture quality of a plasma,not lcd,not led.especially for live action sports,yes they run hotter and use roughly 35 bucks a year more in energy cost....but well worth it"
806020,Beans,2013-09-02 16:35:00,3339,"About a year ago we bought a 42"" Toshiba flat screen Lcd  that we enjoy very much...only complaint is with my cable company...they want an extra $15 a month for the HD converter (?) or $250 to buy it outright...what a piss-off as some companies will give it for free if you sign up with them...Unfortunately they are not in this area...  I am thinking of getting a 32"" Sony or Toshiba Lcd for my bedroom once I save up enough...(Damn Hydro took the $1200 I had saved ) (reconciliation bill in June)"
806025,Squid,2013-09-02 17:13:00,1656,LED all the way just as Raf mentioned. Dark room then its a Plasma. LCD is the old technology and that is why they are so cheap to buy.
805369,davey buoy,2013-08-28 19:29:00,5505,"Looks like my 42"" plasma LG is on it's way out.A lot of dots and getting to the point that I think it's time.Had it for 8 years,on about 12 hours a day so I believe it is done.I do remember paying $1800.00,and that was a heck of a deal,how things have changed .It looks like most tv's of this size now are in the $4-$500 range.If you guys were to buy one now,what would you think would be the best picture and value in your opinion?.Any one who has bought one recently,I would be interested in your feed back. Thanks Dave. On a side note,are the big box stores the way to go when they have sales?.Or would it be better to buy on line?.Not really sure if to buy on line what would be my best buy for value.Were really thinking of trying something other than plasma,since our living room does have two windows,so it is fairly bright most times.Thanks for your opinions."
805370,Raf,2013-08-28 19:36:00,3495,"if you're a heavy moviephile/tv elitist and the tv goes in a dark room, get a plasma  if you want an excellent all-round tv that you can watch in a brightly lit room get an led  lcd backlighting is old technology now.  led tvs are least power hungry, plasmas most if that matters to you  picture quality plasma generally win but the difference is not very big.  http://www.rtings.com/info/lcd-vs-led-vs-plasma"

805376,John Bacon,2013-08-28 19:53:00,3277,Plasma also has the highest refresh rate.  That makes it better for sports and action.

805379,Bill Shearer,2013-08-28 20:03:00,456,"Plasma for me, and from Costco. Best warranty available, with no hassle. But since its your money and your families eyes that watch it, buy whichever you like, but buy it from Costco, IMO"
805380,Richie Razor,2013-08-28 20:09:00,536,LED all the way. Have a sony bravia and never seen sports and colours this vivid before....plus low energy usage.
805381,kickingfrog,2013-08-28 20:16:00,8333,"x2 for the Costco warranty.  I now treat tvs as the disposable trash that the companies now make them. Took me a long time to come to terms with buying junk but I don't worry about it anymore. It's a tv, not my recreation equipment."
805382,DRIFTER_016,2013-08-28 20:24:00,10439,One thing to remember LED TV's are LCD TV's. The older non-LED versions of LCD TV have a Liquid Crystal Screen with CCFL back lighting (florescent tubes) and the newer LED TV's have a Liquid Crystal Screen with LED back lighting (light emitting diodes). The LED's make for a brighter image and use less power. They are also less likely to have the back lighting fail or dim over time. If purchasing LCD make sure to get the highest refresh rate available so you don't get any motion blur when watching action flicks and sports.  I have a plasma as I watch plenty of sports and I also believe the colour and image quality is superior to LCD units. I find the LCD units to be a bit harsh and I notice motion blur even on the high end units.  I bought mine at a local retailer but would probably purchase at Bestbuy or Future Shop if it wasn't 1200kms away.
805384,Headhunter,2013-08-28 20:35:00,5703,"I have a Panasonic Plasma TV in 46in scale. It's been a great tv, no issues, no problems. With all that said, the only complaint I have with the plasma is that it generates a great deal of heat. Now that's fine in the cooler months, helps to keep the TV room warm, but in the warmer months, you can sure feel the heat coming off that screen, even with the A/C on. I also have to believe that plasma is much less efficient then other systems. HH"
805385,BillM,2013-08-28 20:37:00,17367,I'll stick with my Panny VT plasma until something better comes out

805393,adempsey,2013-08-28 21:21:00,1498," Couldn't have said it better myself.  One key thing to consider is the software behind the TV.  I personally hate the Samsung software (I have a Blu-Ray and a Plasma TV) and wouldn't buy another because I just can't stand it.   Of course, the others might not be much better.  f you can find a TV you like at Costco, it's a great place to buy it since they have a 90 day return and a two year warranty, IIRC."

Led seems to be the better of all worlds, if you find a lower price almost everyone will try to match prices to make a sale or offer you better pricing on any accessories you might need or want and consider looking into what advantages the ""smart"" set will offer your needs. Good luck."

805489,Fish4Eyes,2013-08-29 12:57:00,1022,"LED or plasma should come down to light levels in the room as Raf mentioned. Plasma shows glare in well lit rooms, especially rooms with alot of natural light. Other things to consider is the heat that the plasma gives off, which is not a good thing in the summer.  I also vouch to purchase a TV at Costco. I have a premium membership and when I bought my Sony Bravia I got 3 years warranty included with no additional cost. Their pricing is usually the cheapest around as well for electronics. If price of TV changes in 90 days, they will also reimburse the difference. Not sure how big of a rush your in but when I hit Costco next time I can take a few pics of what they got for you. Send me a PM if I can help. i would need to know the size and type (plasma/lcd/led) of TV to look for."
805500,hutch4113,2013-08-29 14:03:00,374,"I have a 39 inch LCD, and enjoyed the picture.  It was in a bright room, etc., so it was the correct choice.  However we just finished our basement, and put a entertainment area in, so it was time to upgrade.  After a lot of research, I went with a Samsung F8500 - 64 inch.  This is their flagship model that competes with the Panasonic VT model (now ZT I believe).  Colours are definitely sharper, clearer.  And on the plus side, the Samsung is probably the brightest Plasma around.  It will really come down to - Budget, Room Type, and what you watch.  I used this forum in the decision process -> http://www.avsforum.com/f/.  Everyone will have their opinion - and think their TV choice is the best - but what I was mainly looking for were problem issues, etc.  Next do some searches on the the model you are looking for, RE: reviews.  CNET usually has some good reviews and can point you in the correct direction. Finally the big box stores, including Costco, have I guess what I will call the ""general"" market TV's.  If you are looking for the high end models (Like the Panasonic VT/ZT or Samsung F8500), will have to go to smaller stores, like 2001 Audio, etc.  (I can point you in the direction - have a friend that works there - he won't upsell you) - course that only works if you are in Barrie...hahahahahaa.  FInally - TV's still cheaper in the US.  This guy was extremely helpful -> https://clevelandplasma.com/.  I ended up buying my TV locally, but it was a close thing."
805531,Mike Pike,2013-08-29 16:35:00,1332,"I preffer plasma myself, and enjoy the movies and all the sports I watch on it.  My advise would be to go for a bigger screen this time, Davey.  I was glad I did!  Remember you don't need to sit back far away from the tv with these screens, so room size isn't an issue.  And I have never heard anyone say; ""Man, I wish I had gotten a smaller screen!""  lol"
