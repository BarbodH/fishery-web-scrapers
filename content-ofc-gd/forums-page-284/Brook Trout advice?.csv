But from what I understand, they get to be a much better size in the lakes. Either way, I don't really know where to start looking. I live in the durham region, and have tried some of the headwaters of some tribs... only to find chub and once in a while a resident rainbow. I've heard flies, spinners and spoons work well for them.Any recommendations of where I should begin my hunt? I'm not asking for spots in particular, unless you are willing to give up a lake name lol... but more of general area. Anything remotely close to the durham region?  Thanks in advance for any hints that you may or may not send my way."
