The motor came with a 5 year warranty when I bought it, just wondering if these are transferable? Im also wondering what work is involved in transferring the title of the boat and trailer to the new owner? One final question, I paid just under 18000 brand new for the boat what can I realistically expect to get for it now. These might be silly questions but this is the first boat I have owned and first im looking to sell. Any input would be greatly appreciated."
805708,misfish,2013-08-30 19:49:00,29133,"My pop had the same boat. Paid just a little less. Sold it last year with less then 50 hrs on it for $12,500. It was powered with a 50hp merc.  Hope that helps for selling cost."
805711,wannabefisherman,2013-08-30 20:10:00,19,"check the ads (kijiji particularly) to see what your boat and/or similar goes for.  part of it will depend on the market for that type of boat.  the warranties should be transferrable. it will be in the documentation you got with the boat.  ownership, etc... is all the buyers responsibility. you just sign the ownership of the trailer over.  and do up a bill of sale, that's all."
805723,bawbag,2013-08-30 21:04:00,48,"Cheers guys, glad to hear its a pretty painless process"
805736,lookinforwalleye,2013-08-30 21:54:00,4399,Yes painless if you consider losing several grand after two years. When you look for a larger rig try finding one that is a couple year old and return the depreciation favor.
805749,aplumma,2013-08-30 23:02:00,6896,"The market is about to be flooded with boats the fall is typically not the best time to sell to maximize the profit. On the same not the spring is not the time to replace the boat either. Best of luck on the sale. The perfect storm is buy in the fall then sell yours in the spring if it is possible,   Art"
805751,bawbag,2013-08-30 23:06:00,48,Ya the hit im taking to upgrade to a bigger boat definitely isn't painless lol Two good points Art thank you.
805755,kickingfrog,2013-08-30 23:17:00,8333,The counter is that you have to store the boat(s) during the winter.
805775,porkpie,2013-08-31 01:24:00,2521,"The used boat market is pretty flooded right now, and prices are lower than usual.  Something to think about!"
805795,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-31 11:13:00,8243,"I'd suggest you look to trade it for a larger boat, there is someone out there looking to downsize to a smaller boat."
806006,pics,2013-09-02 12:55:00,1268,It might only be worth $2 grand or so but I'll give you $4 !!  This is definately a buyers market..but then again you will also save on the bigger boat...
806011,Renegade67,2013-09-02 13:30:00,86,Here is everything you should need to know on how to transfer a boat registraion; http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety/debs-obs-paperwork-paperwork_boat_licence-3211.htm I just did one and it arrived in less that two weeks.  You need to mail the information to New Brunswick.  It does not cost anything.  This is for the registration and is not an ownership.   You keep the original BOS for that.  The regsitration is good for 10 years.
