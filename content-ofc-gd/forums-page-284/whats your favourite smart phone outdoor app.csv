805796,i2cool2fool,2013-08-31 11:16:00,349,I use: - Navionics - WeatherBug - MyRadar - Grog Knots
805805,Pikeslayer,2013-08-31 13:42:00,1443,While fishing...the off button. And it's free  Pre-fishing...I take advantage of the apps previously mentioned. Some great tools . I'll add Sailflow. Most important for the big water and very accurate.
805814,Angler management,2013-08-31 14:55:00,280,"Navionics, google maps, sky view, and TWN"
805815,BillM,2013-08-31 14:59:00,17367,"Wundermap, best weather app out there.  Although when I'm on the water, the cell phone is back in the truck."
805831,Joeytier,2013-08-31 18:26:00,3990,"The CanadaMaps app is great for navigating the maze of forest access trails, and a good radar app is helpful as well, but I use my garmin for everything else."
805836,fishindevil,2013-08-31 20:12:00,6254,For the Great Lakes and simcoe wind guru is a good one as well of weather office it's the government weather site for waves and wind and all areas if Ontario it's cool too !!! Global sky tracker is a good radar map for showing rain and snow and wind as well !!! There are tons out there and yes navionics as well for my iPhone is way cool too
805865,Cast-Away,2013-08-31 22:41:00,790,King City radar or Britt when on Gbay.
805888,nexstar,2013-09-01 00:49:00,63,Navionics & The Weather Network Apps are my go to.
805892,vance,2013-09-01 01:13:00,719,Rain alarm and the weather network for weather when i am in cell coverage
805893,irishfield,2013-09-01 01:20:00,26272,Leave it in the cottage window and go out fishing... my favourite outdoor app !

805973,manitoubass2,2013-09-01 21:51:00,11391,Wunderground for weather wind and radar. Navionics and that's it for me
805998,adolson,2013-09-02 04:03:00,783,"Another Wunderground fan here, though I don't use the app as much as the site itself.  OruxMaps for GPS needs, if I forgot my Garmin.  That's about it. I tend to keep my phone with me if I'm alone, in case of emergencies."
806048,spincast,2013-09-02 20:33:00,3279,the off button. Although I do take it with me just in case. On one occasion it saved my bacon on a very cold day.
806120,Stoty,2013-09-03 03:44:00,2910,"Navionics - won't leave home without it, especially on the ice..... Wind Finder AccuWeather And of course my fishing log web application that I wrote"
