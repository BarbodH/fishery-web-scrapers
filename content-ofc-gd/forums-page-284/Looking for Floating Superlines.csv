806084,okumasheffield,2013-09-03 00:04:00,318,Looking for floating superlines or superlines with minimum water absorption  The only one I know is - Nanofil - HydroFloat   Thanks  
806086,MJL,2013-09-03 00:13:00,2427,P-Line Hydrofloat?  Never used it myself but it's supposed to float
806091,BillM,2013-09-03 00:30:00,17367,Use Nanofil.
806096,landry,2013-09-03 01:13:00,1005,Fire line crystal. Awesome senko line. Floats and it is visible. I attach 8lb flouro and u can see slightest movement.

806174,BillM,2013-09-03 14:46:00,17367," Word of caution, once the below zero temps get here switch back over to the Raven..  Ice in the guides will rip Nanofil to shreds..  That being said nothing comes close to it in above zero temps.. Casts a mile, zero stretch, mends like crazy."
