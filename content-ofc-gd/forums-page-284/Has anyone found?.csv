805449,Christopheraaron,2013-08-29 03:10:00,3525,"The other day (Monday) I was on Oshawa creek, using my pin. The line got wrapped up inside the reel so I took the spool off to try and get it out. Of course as I'm doing this it slips out of my hand and I lose it in the drink, it's a Greys Bewick silver centrepin spool, I lost it just below the Thomas st bridge. PLEASE if anyone finds it shoot me a PM or email me at [emailÂ protected] if anyone finds it I would be glad to tie 20 steelhead/trout flies of the persons choice. Thanks"
805461,Musky or Specks,2013-08-29 04:48:00,2710,Damn Chris that sucks.
805491,mike rousseau,2013-08-29 13:07:00,4661,Was you line not attached to the spool....????
805494,Christopheraaron,2013-08-29 13:23:00,3525,The line managed to get cut somehow on the clicker....
805496,Ralph Field,2013-08-29 13:27:00,1018,"That defines a bad day on the water,hope someone finds it for you."
805522,ketchenany,2013-08-29 15:48:00,3229,I'd go back with a powerful magnet and sweep the area. Many years ago I had a guy return all of my lures I dropped in Meadord.
805528,Roy,2013-08-29 16:16:00,13728, Yeah....an aluminum magnet would be best.
805536,mercman,2013-08-29 17:51:00,7054,You are a bad man Roy
805539,esoxansteel,2013-08-29 18:20:00,1307,"Check one of the many shopping carts that are thrown in the creek, it might be in one of those, or an old tire, or a soggy diaper"
805541,Sinker,2013-08-29 18:34:00,8692,"That sucks dude!  How deep is the water where you dropped it? I guess the water was too stained to see it on monday, but it might be cleared up enough now to find it. Have you been back since??  S."
805546,davey buoy,2013-08-29 19:07:00,5505,"That sucks as well,I almost lost a rod on the boat,and was all cleared to jump in.Always anything of value off.Not quite the same at the river bank I know. But would still be worth a swim IMO.Never know when that may happen.Nothing a couple hot totties wouldn't cure  ."
805552,bare foot wader,2013-08-29 19:30:00,1354,"crappy luck, hope you can recover it.....i'd be careful of needles if you're swimming around in that creek...maybe take a long handled net and try dredging the bottom"
805584,ketchenany,2013-08-29 22:09:00,3229,"Maybe some fool should inbed an iron wire/button just in case.  I have convention buttons that are hard to pull apart, les than 1/4 inch across!  On my way MERCMAN coming for a good French wedding! Hope they don't put iron in the putine, ok fries with gravy and chesse."
805598,MJL,2013-08-30 00:57:00,2427,Find someone with an underwater camera like an aqua vu. Mount the camera to a stick and probe the bottom. You definitely don't want to be digging around with your hands in Oshawa creek.
805600,Joeytier,2013-08-30 01:04:00,3990,I wonder how many people will be rooting around the dirty old Thomas st bridge tomorrow morning...  Best of luck in finding it.  I strongly suggest the magnet idea
805623,Christopheraaron,2013-08-30 01:44:00,3525,Is that an offer?
805647,hirk,2013-08-30 10:55:00,571,Chris pm me exact location if you can and i will wear my polarized  and take a look while walking the dog.
