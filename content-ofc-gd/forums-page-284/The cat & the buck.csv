I watched him rooting around in some bushes for about 10 minutes and couldn't figure out what he was doing until suddenly a black cat came flying out. Don't know if he was playing with the cat or just inquisitive, but it was pretty comical to watch.  A young buck with 8"" antlers.    You can just make out the cat to the left of center.     No idea why the pictures are fuzzy though, maybe cause it was still fairly dark when they we're taken ??"

Can't miss the cat Lew, his eyes give him away  All you need now Lew is a lake in your front yard to cast for those BIG girl Muskies Got any places for sale near you Lew? If I could only talk the wife into it"
