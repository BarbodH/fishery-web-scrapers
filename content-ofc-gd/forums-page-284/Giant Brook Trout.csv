805273,solopaddler,2013-08-28 00:14:00,8605,"A very good friend of mine in Thunder Bay sent me these photos a couple of days ago. I'm just in total awe of this fish myself and thought it was worth sharing.  A hair over 25"" long, incredibly thick and fat, and 8.1lb's on the digital scale.  The photos aren't the best, he was fishing alone as he usually does, but nevertheless very impressive.  What gets me, he told me he had an even larger fish rush in and swipe at his lure a couple of days later.  What's killing me is I don't have time to get up there and fish with him. It's torture LOL!      "
805275,BillM,2013-08-28 00:16:00,17367,"Holy crap, I think it's a relative of the one my oldman got!!!! LOL!    So thick and wide, just insane!"

805363,mike rousseau,2013-08-28 17:04:00,4661,So fat
805364,MrSimon,2013-08-28 17:05:00,217,That fish looks almost unhealthily fat.  Any chance there is something wrong with it that made it look so bloated and fat?
805367,BillM,2013-08-28 18:14:00,17367," It's not bloated.... And it's defintely not unhealthy, lol."
805368,Paulus,2013-08-28 18:56:00,522,"Although, reportedly it did complain about feeling bloated at the time.   "
805377,misfish,2013-08-28 19:55:00,29133,Very very nice.  Thanks for posting Mike.

805665,siwash,2013-08-30 12:35:00,683,"Beauty fish, Mike...  Wow!!"
805688,Joeytier,2013-08-30 16:26:00,3990,"It's amazing to think that the record was still much, much larger than that gigantic fish."
805694,jimmer,2013-08-30 17:24:00,2730,"Nice fish! Thanks for sharing Mike. Funny, we are usually envious of you when we see your pictures; always wishing we could visit your fishing locations."
