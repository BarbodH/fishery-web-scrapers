805673,Tybo,2013-08-30 13:47:00,1373,"Thank you.  .A tear of joy swell from the corner of  the eye placing it's self  on a weathered cheek. The thought of the years that have past.Some with dark shadows.Other with great victories. Most though, carving out a living. For on this day I have became 50 of year. For the joy is not for that. It's one more year I can tell the devil to kiss my a$$."
