803175,Locnar,2013-08-13 23:55:00,645,"As one who  doesn't know a lot about Salmon fishing... especially in the creeks and rivers... Do they tend to run up the same creeks as the trout? And tend to run as far up stream? I'm going to give it a shot this year, and was just wondering about that.  I know that after September 30th, I'd have to stay below Hwy 2. in my region."
803177,solopaddler,2013-08-13 23:55:00,8605,"Hours of daylight play a role, but a minor one at least imo.  Bear in mind different strains of fish will run at different times. A prime example being the Notty. That river traditionally always sees the earliest runs of fish.  The two biggest factors are water temps and rainfall.  Beyond the first couple weeks of July this has been an extraordinarily cool and wet summer. Fish are showing up in certain rivers waaaay earlier than usual. Pulaski for example has seen an inordinate amount of rain and there's already been a substantial amount of fish enter the Salmon river.  Locally guys have been hitting kings, browns and rainbows off the local piers for a while now. Again, way earlier than usual. Many of the salmon are already dark and are staging off the rivermouths for a while now, again much earlier than usual.  Watch the weather forecast. If your favorite river gets hit with another good slug of rain there will be a push of fish."
803226,Musky or Specks,2013-08-14 05:21:00,2710,Your right about the Notty Mike I've caught them up in Angus on Simcoe Day and of coarse the river shakers all come in to feed so its also a good early Steelie river
803484,Twocoda,2013-08-15 19:38:00,4130,I went down fishing to the river last night because it feels like the middle of Sept and fish were jumping ...and the only excuse i can come up with for being skunked is ....i didnt have my lucky underoos on...so that is a key factor as well...
805062,redpearl99,2013-08-26 13:51:00,259,anyone think this rain will finally cause them to head up the rivers?
805065,BillM,2013-08-26 14:09:00,17367," Salmon hate rain, they'll go out to the middle of the lake instead."
805069,porkpie,2013-08-26 14:55:00,2521,There will be a false run with this rainfall in certain tributaries indeed!
805090,Twocoda,2013-08-26 17:35:00,4130, was trying to post some Data from a spead sheet of early fish counts but it wouldnt load properly so deleted 
805091,Twocoda,2013-08-26 17:42:00,4130,lol...kinda like the way Wayne Newton hates the sun
805120,BillM,2013-08-26 20:13:00,17367, LOL!
805136,Sinker,2013-08-26 22:18:00,8692,I predict the piers and harbours will be loaded tonight. With people.....probably some fish too.  S.
805139,Christopheraaron,2013-08-26 22:34:00,3525,"was just out east, no fish yet, lots of people though."
805986,vinnimon,2013-09-02 00:39:00,2593,A good sniffer will sense when it's just the right time to cast a line!
802568,wask,2013-08-10 16:09:00,174,"Hey guys, been a long time since I've been around and a long time since I fished the Salmon run.  I have a friend that wants to come up and fish the salmon run in Southern Ontario.  We were thinking Bowmanville, Port Hope ext.  What is the window for that?  My best recollection was it was the first big rain after the weather turns but about when is that?  Thanks in advance...  "
802576,Canuck2fan,2013-08-10 16:27:00,1444,The guys I fish with are having the same debate as well. I won't make any predictions this year because the weather has been so strange. I am just waiting until I hear the water temps are in the range at the mouths and then will give it a go. It could snow or be 40C next week the way things have so far this summer LOL.
802577,Sinker,2013-08-10 16:30:00,8692,Full moon in august always brings fish in. Temps don't meat squat!  S.
802579,BillM,2013-08-10 16:50:00,17367,Fish are already being caught off the piers.
802581,misfish,2013-08-10 16:58:00,29133, Not the one I was at this morning. 5-7 guys chucking.Nadda.
802582,BillM,2013-08-10 16:58:00,17367," Try a different one, lol."
802584,fishnsled,2013-08-10 17:02:00,3520,Told you not to listen to Cliff...LOL!!
802585,misfish,2013-08-10 17:05:00,29133," Good thing he,s bass fishing. I would give him the what for.LOL"
802590,Tim Mills,2013-08-10 18:22:00,476,there have been years when  tempeture drops at night have triggered runs on the credit.
802594,Rich,2013-08-10 19:32:00,3927,"I dunno what triggers em, but I start the last week of August on the Erie tribs.  Erie is about a month behind Lady O most years.. so you should probably get chucking!"
802596,danc,2013-08-10 20:19:00,4677,There are several factors that determine the run. I'd say that the amout of daylight hours is one of the biggest.
802598,misfish,2013-08-10 20:32:00,29133,"Back when,(off the old Texico plant) my best times were off shore for them,was at early morning and dusk  Thats when they are on the move."
802600,Photoz,2013-08-10 20:42:00,792,"I've spent about 4 days in the last 2 weeks washing Cleo's, Rapalas & roe  in the Ganny. . . .   haven't had a sniff of anything yet. I've been checkin' out the garbage cans in the fish cleanin' station after the boaters come in, the roe left in there is not nearly mature yet . . . .    probably 4  -  to 5 weeks before the females egg cache is gonna be ripe. Lotsa FREE roe being dumped from the cleaned fish . . . . .   it's there for the taking . . . .   you don't have to kill any fish to get it!"
802644,Musky or Specks,2013-08-11 03:03:00,2710,I predict lots of marshmallow and flossing.
802649,Richie Razor,2013-08-11 03:37:00,536,"I was going to say, I was in the supermarket today and noticed they were completely sold out of the larger 'mallows in the white pattern. They still had ample supply of the multi-coloured 'mallow pattern. Basically it's a guessing game to which pattern works best, however don't count out the lowly cigarette butt!!! Works wonders in frog water in the white as well as the tan pattern. Good luck!!!"
802650,John Bacon,2013-08-11 03:39:00,3277,I was out today.  We were catching salmon in 400' of water; about 12 miles off shore.  The three we kept all had eggs.  I think the pier fishing may have to wait.
802653,danc,2013-08-11 03:44:00,4677,"Salmon don't have access to weather forecasts, thermometers, or raincoats. Length of daylight is what triggers the run."
802655,Sinker,2013-08-11 06:10:00,8692,"Photoperiod controls a lot more than most people realize.  Watch the moon phases. That full moon that's coming will have fish up the rivers regardless of temps, rain, or conditions. It always will.  S."
802749,FloatnFly,2013-08-11 22:48:00,1640,"there is no definite answer, they'll run when they are ready, this time last year i was catching them in the creeks"
802794,Rich,2013-08-12 10:13:00,3927,I think they have shifted from photoperiod migration to vibration migration. When there's about 250 spoons being retrieved at the same time off every pier it really bring em in.
802815,laszlo,2013-08-12 13:35:00,487,All factors to consider:  1) Hours of daylight  2) Rain  3) Water temps  4) Moon phase
802877,davey buoy,2013-08-12 19:15:00,5505,All I know is I have to make the effort to find them myself.I'm sure they will be running in the next month or three  .lol.
802903,Richie Razor,2013-08-12 21:02:00,536,"Just checked a local river where they would be easy to locate if they were indeed in.... NADA. Need more rain, and cooler nights - then the madness begins!!!!"
802912,Twocoda,2013-08-12 21:42:00,4130,Agreed...when the vegetation start to starch they can taste home...it isnt on fire up here yet....but there are fish being caught...
803166,jjcanoe,2013-08-13 23:39:00,744,"The lower Niagara usually gets an early start, August 8th was the earliest date I ever got a fish in the whirlpool, that was in the early 90's. Back then if you didn't have your first salmon by the 20th, you were doing something wrong! Queenston, the Glen or he 'pool are almost always your best bet for the first run, and theres lots of other bonus fish around if the salmon aren't, big strong bass, double digit walleye, and the odd large musky, my pb was 44"" caught on a lime Canadian wiggler in the 'pool."
