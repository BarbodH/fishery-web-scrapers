805469,pics,2013-08-29 08:28:00,1268,"Can't say I know much about the fishing but if you are in a dingy(especially one of the cheaper Can tire ones) powered with an electric motor, wear a life jacket and make yourself visible.. Lots of big, fast boats running around there...."
805480,mistaredone,2013-08-29 11:52:00,913,Lots of Pike and bass and pretty well everything else you might want to target.  Throw a spinner bait with a leader and you'll get into some fish.
805757,fishsevern,2013-08-30 23:25:00,112,"I'll be on Little Lake this weekend.  For your small craft, keep to the south end for accessibility and decent fishing around the islands.  The regattas have to slow down through there so you should be ok."
805808,fisherman7,2013-08-31 13:57:00,325,I fish the PS area in my little inflatable as well. I only use a chartreuse spinner bait and usual catch 3-4 pike on my outings. Try fishing in 12-14 feet of water around the islands.  PM me and I'll give you a location or two.
806103,nexstar,2013-09-03 01:37:00,63,G pool has some good smallies. But your inflatable boat might not get you out far. Stay around docks and shorelines.
