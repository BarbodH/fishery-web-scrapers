805630,Dan668,2013-08-30 03:29:00,1120,"My maytag dryer died today. Was 27 years old. The washing machine on the other hand is 8 years old, and needs a new transmission, also a maytag. Going to go and look for a new pair. Not familiar with washers/dryers. Whats the general consensus on top/front load? Anyone have a recommendation on a machine/brand? Would like to try to stay under $2000 if possible.  Thanks"
805631,ctdd2006,2013-08-30 03:45:00,531,Sears has a great deal this weekend on a Samsung F/L set.  Steam dryer.  1399.99 for the pair.  Great feedback.

805634,John Bacon,2013-08-30 04:50:00,3277,I normally don't like extended warranties.  But I bought an oven from Sears a few months ago.  They offered a five year warranty.  If we do not use the warranty then we get the value of the warranty as a store credit after the five years is up.  I am not sure if that is standard on all Kenmore products; but that is something to consider.
805653,fishing n autograph,2013-08-30 11:27:00,2540,"Anything maytag, whirlpool, GE will do and I definitely recommend a front loader. You can do so much more laundry in less time and they are more efficient"
805655,scugpg,2013-08-30 11:48:00,1373,I have had great success with the lg front loaders. the wm3470 is the model I would look for in the washer if I was buying today. dryer anything 7.3 cubic ft and higher.  not sure steam is necessary on either but having a sanitize (built in heater) on washer is good for dish towels etc.  oh and if you can get the pedestals it makes things much easier
805656,leaf4,2013-08-30 11:54:00,2466,The sanitize is great for my dirty work clothes...  gets out all sorts of  crap that shows up in a day of ductwork in messy work plants but it's a 2 hour cycle on my LG so I make sure it's after 7pm when I throw it on lol
805660,DanD,2013-08-30 12:09:00,2223,"We just bought a dryer from Sears and that extended warranty deal goes on most of the products they sell. Doing some research and reading consumer reports; I found that these steam dryers do as they say (less wrinkled clothing); but after people buying them, rarely use the option; most clothing is permanent press. It went on to say that the people that do use this option, mostly use it to ""freshen up"" their shirts, rather them wash them. (office workers?) Again according to the consumer reports, a good feature to purchase on a dryer is a moister sensor. With this feature the drying cycle stops when a certain moister level is felt in the dryer. Rather then using a timed drying cycle, where it'll continue too run until the set time has elapsed. I'll tell you how it works later; the new dryer is still sitting in the basement not hooked up. LOL  Dan. "
805781,Dan668,2013-08-31 02:16:00,1120,"Thanks for the suggestions. I think we may stick with top loaders, tried to convince the rest of the fam to go the other way, no chance. Liked a few of the lg, samsung and maytag offerings."
805806,fisherman7,2013-08-31 13:55:00,325,"Best advice I got from the washing machine repair guy was ""the more bells and whistles you get, the more I make"". We just bought a new dryer and washing machine last year. Rotary dials and no electronics gizmos."
805813,Muskieman,2013-08-31 14:43:00,2472,"Top load all the way , we gave away a perfect Inqlis TL and dryer so we could keep up with the Jonses by buying a FL Whirlpool and a matching dryer ... 2x POS ... Washing machine lasted 2 yrs and the dryer kept blowing the tensioner ... we lucked out and got our old appliances back , they run like the day they were built in 1995. We also have a FL at work it's always broken .  My 2Â¢"
805936,aplumma,2013-09-01 13:19:00,6896,Top loader for me also. I had a front loader but their dirty little secret is they mold if you keep the door closed. I now have the samsung toploader that works great and is also a direct drive so no belts to worry about.   Art
