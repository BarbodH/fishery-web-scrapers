805885,mike rousseau,2013-09-01 00:43:00,4661,I was told at 100/1 some had issues...  I had a 9.9 that said 100/1 and I mixed 50/1... Never had a problem... Didn't really smoke
805891,vance,2013-09-01 01:09:00,719,My dad had that exact motor and ran it 100/1 .If you ran it wide open for a while and shut it off to fish it was a HARD pull to yank into life.Convinced the oldman to go to 50/1 and there were no more problems.  vance
805896,porkpie,2013-09-01 01:31:00,2521,I have a 96 Johnson 15 (same motor as Evinrude.) I run it 50-1 and have always done so.  I would not run 100-1.  I use amsoil synthetic and have very little smoke.
805903,walleyejack,2013-09-01 01:56:00,358,ok   thanks.. consensus is  50:1        and i use synthetic in everything..  thanks again
805935,aplumma,2013-09-01 13:15:00,6896,If you are using amsoil or an oil that is formulated as 100:1 you are safe. Personally  I mix at 80:1 using amsoil in some high performance motors and never had an oil related failure.   Art
