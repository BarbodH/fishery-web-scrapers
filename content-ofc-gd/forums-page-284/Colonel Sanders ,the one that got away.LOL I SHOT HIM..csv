Where he came from,apparently no one knows. The workers dont seem to mined him hanging around.I get a great laugh every morning when I get woke up by his cocka doddle doo.  Some here,not so much. So sad.   LOL  Reminds me of the country.  He even stopped traffic today. Gives the real meaning to,WHY DID THE ROOSTER CROSS THE ROAD. LMAO  Everytime I see him,I think,fire the BBQ.LOL      He,s a bigg,n    I think this is so cool.  "

804940,Terry,2013-08-25 20:05:00,14456,  ok  I don't know why  but that just sounded wrong    not that there is anything wrong with that  the first part not the second
804943,Big Cliff,2013-08-25 20:15:00,6899,"Had a banty rooster many years ago, he was one mean, tough little bugger. He would chase the dogs, the kids, anything or anyone that got near the hens. I finally had to shoot the darn thing, you couldn't catch him.  Wife cooked him up; I came in the house and CJ was sitting at the table crying. When I asked why he was crying he said ""I can't eat roostie"". I told him it was no different than any other chicken and he looked at me and said ""well, you try"" so I did. That bird was just as tough cooked as he was when he was alive. Needless to say we ate something different that night!"
804965,Richie Razor,2013-08-25 21:29:00,536,"You need to net it, behead and dress it, and into a roasting pot with onions, carrots, and celery.... Nothing better than free range chicken."
804966,MJL,2013-08-25 21:31:00,2427, Free range indeed...He's got the whole neighbourhood.LOL  I'm surprised a coyote or a fox hasn't gotten it yet
804968,Richie Razor,2013-08-25 21:42:00,536,"Actually it would be a good frying chicken, cut up in pieces, soak in buttermilk and tobasco overnight, dredge in your own homemade Kentucky batter, and right into some hot peanut oil. Oh man I'm getting hungry"
805051,porkpie,2013-08-26 12:42:00,2521,Crock pot!  Only cure for rooster!
805054,Rich,2013-08-26 13:09:00,3927,Mmm beer can capon
805057,Headhunter,2013-08-26 13:13:00,5703,"That bird would cook up nice with some curry and a can of coconut milk! After about 4 hours of stewing, some slaw and rice and peas and your golden!HH"
805058,Roy,2013-08-26 13:21:00,13728,The rooster's last crow.
806014,misfish,2013-09-02 14:50:00,29133,The bugger crossed the road and made a visit. This is one dumb bird.      
806017,Crazy Ivan,2013-09-02 15:35:00,184,The first scene in this cartoon seems relevant.  
806021,Richie Razor,2013-09-02 16:43:00,536,That was your chance!!!!!
