805597,Angler management,2013-08-30 00:53:00,280,"Last minute decision to go camping with a few friends. Most sites are booked up and regardless, we would prefer crown land camping. Hoping to find a spot maybe 2hrs. From gta with good fishing and swimming for the ladies. Thanx in advance guys!"
805601,Joeytier,2013-08-30 01:06:00,3990,Good luck...lol
805604,Angler management,2013-08-30 01:11:00,280,Is this like asking for fishing spots?? Or the 2hrs from gta that make it a crazy question? Nothing near kawartha highlands or maybe a little further?
805605,danbouck,2013-08-30 01:12:00,4380,2 hours from GTA is likely not going to happen
805606,Raf,2013-08-30 01:14:00,3495,not much crown land within 2 hrs especially sites you can drive-to.
805610,Angler management,2013-08-30 01:17:00,280,What about islands or portage spots? I find it hard to believe there isnt good spots 200 kms from durham. Even big island on pigeon lake was crown up until recently...
805611,irishfield,2013-08-30 01:17:00,26272,"Everything that was available that close along the 400 has been posted no parking... the hwy ditches changed so you can't get off and park in the grass etc to use the crown around 6 mile, McCreary, Gibson, etc. unless you really do your homework."
805612,Angler management,2013-08-30 01:21:00,280,"What about further north east area? A little further then 2 hours isnt out of the question, just thought we wouldnt have to go that far to find something."
805613,NAW,2013-08-30 01:21:00,4022," Not to sound like a sap.  But a nice crown land campsite is a precious thing.  Specially within 2 hours of the big stink.  I can only think or a dozen or so.  But they where found through lots of research and ground pounding.   I'd tell you where they where.  But because of the good old Internet, you need to show up a day before the long weekend to get a spot."
805614,johnnyb,2013-08-30 01:25:00,3413,"If you have a canoe head for the Magnetewan, French or Pickerel River.  Find a marina or lodge to pay a few bucks for parking and paddle till you find a spot you can make do with.  2 hours or closer isn't going to happen"
805616,Angler management,2013-08-30 01:29:00,280," Thats true, never thought of it that way when i wrote the post. I found OFC very helpful in the past with similar info and figured it was worth a shot and a lot easier then calling up family and friends for days to get helpful information about places i wasnt familiar with. Im sure we will find something, just going to be harder then i though. Thanks for the input tho guys."
805617,NAW,2013-08-30 01:31:00,4022,I don't mean to sound like a dick head or anything.It's just a tough question to get answers to the day before a long weekend. No matter how great OFC is!
805618,can u fish,2013-08-30 01:34:00,326,PM Sent.
805619,Angler management,2013-08-30 01:34:00,280,"Perfectly understandable, i think i might have come across some spots near apsley and bancroft. I just hope they pan out and arent a waste of a long weekend lol."
805620,SirCranksalot,2013-08-30 01:34:00,3291,I know a place just N-E of P Sound where you could camp and catch bass. PM me if interested.
805633,livinisfishin,2013-08-30 04:01:00,661,I thought that was a fair and a straight to the point answer! I wont lie kinda made me chuckle a bit....when you called it the big stink.
805669,torco,2013-08-30 13:36:00,656,"I am thinking the same place. I was just there last weekend and I doubt he would get a site, it was rammed last week. I was there bout 4-5 years ago and we were the only group around."
805672,Angler management,2013-08-30 13:40:00,280,Ya i think we're going to extend our drive a little bit and find a nice quiet island to set up camp. I want to thank all the great ppl who sent me PMs and even offered private land to camp on. You guys are the best!!!
805674,lew,2013-08-30 13:50:00,12766,We used to have a member on this board who camped on the islands of Lower Buckhorn north of Peterboro on a regular basis. As far as I know he was never hassled but that was 8 or 9 years ago and I have no idea how things are today.
805675,Angler management,2013-08-30 13:55:00,280,"We were looking for a lake more suitable for swimming, but we used to camp Big island on Pigeon years ago without any hasstle. Shame that island is private property now. It was sooo convenient for a fishing outing with the boys. But now my feiend owns Rolling Hills Estates across the pond and is even more convenient. Lol"
805677,BillM,2013-08-30 13:58:00,17367,"Six Mile lake PP has open spots, was there lastnight to do a little fishing with the oldman.  Good ramp, decent beach, fishing is good if you know where to go."
805680,Governator,2013-08-30 15:25:00,879,"That's a pretty bold question to ask the day before the last long weekend of the summer.  I think the further north you're willing to drive (like North Bay to Subury), the more open people get for their crown land spots but within 2hrs from TO is pretty tight sealed I think from everyone.  I'm sure if you made a few calls or checked online you'll fine some campsites still available.  Looks like there are open tent spots available at the KOA in Parry Sound.  There are boat launches around, one just a minute down the road and a beach a little further, plus a pool.  That's assuming you don't mind a freight train whaling the horn close by a couple times a night LOL!  Also, maybe check Sibbald Point PP, you got boat launch for simcoe and a big beach for the ladies."
805727,irishfield,2013-08-30 21:16:00,26272,"To the best of my knowledge that island has been private land for decades and many just assumed it was crown land. You were trespassing in days past like many others, they just won't tolerate it anymore. Lots of land like that in Ontario where ""I use to take my kids there to picnic.. and suddenly someone put up a fence"". Check out the MNR land atlas and next time you'll know what you're on."
805792,bow slayer,2013-08-31 07:00:00,1074,I just got home from 6 mile tonite and most of the spots i came across were full or filling
