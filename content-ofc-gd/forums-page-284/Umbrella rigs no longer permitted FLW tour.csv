That said, umbrella rigs will be permitted in our other tournament circuits, but with restrictions that limit them to a maximum of five wires outfitted with a maximum of five spinners and five lures, only three of which can have hooks. This decision is consistent with the wishes of a majority of our anglers while heading off potential conservation concerns.” After taking a wait-and-see approach with regard to use of umbrella rigs on the FLW Tour in 2012 and 2013, FLW officials came to the conclusion, after seeking input from FLW Tour pros, that it was in the best interests of the sport to prohibit the use of umbrella rigs at the Tour level. “It’s definitely a step in the right direction,” said 2013 Forrest Wood Cup champion Randall Tharp. “From the very first tournament of the year I saw where this was heading. The biggest reason I didn’t like it was that it made a whole lot of other technologies obsolete and that’s not good for the sport. The question for me was: Where do you draw the line? At Beaver Lake some people were throwing 20 baits on one rig. So where does it end? I realize that new technology has always been part of the sport, but I think in this case, FLW did a good job drawing a line where they did.”"
