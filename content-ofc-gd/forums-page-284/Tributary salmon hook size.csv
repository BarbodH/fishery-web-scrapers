805712,redpearl99,2013-08-30 20:17:00,259,Can someone please tell me what is the best hook size to use for trib fishing for salmon with roe bags?  I have size 10 for steelhead but I assume that's too small for salmon.   Red
805713,danjang,2013-08-30 20:35:00,148,The gauge is more important than the size. Get extra strong hooks. They are thicker and meant for the larger fish. Also I find cheaper brands bend or break more often.
805716,redpearl99,2013-08-30 20:50:00,259,"If i do get strong hooks, what size should they be in?"
805722,Bill Shearer,2013-08-30 21:01:00,456,"Raven extra strong Octopus in #6, #4, should be more then adequate, IMO. Those same hooks in #10, #8, account for 90% of the steelhead I catch. I used  the #6, #4, and sometimes #2 for steelhead in BC this spring, but I pinched down the barb, as per BC Laws. They held every fish without any fail. Actually graphically showed me how little the barb really matters, if you pay attention to to the fish!!  Bill"
805758,Twocoda,2013-08-30 23:31:00,4130,honestly it depends on the size of bag your running and that depends on the clarity of the water your fishing ...which in turn determines the size of hook you should be running...presentation is everything ....there is alot to be said for catching a huge arse salmon on a size 14 hook...cheers
