The plan was troll... Troll ... Troll... As usual... We were rigged with deep diving minnow baits as well as worm harnesses on 3 way rigs tipped with gulp...  We headed out just after noon... Lines in around 1pm... Or what magazines would say isn't a good time to fish... Well... Not the case...  We had a 12 fish limit of nice walleye in 2.5 hours... From 100-330pm... And no... We weren't deep... All fish were in 12-20 feet of crystal clear water... The walleye were biting so well that at one point we had a double header on the harnesses and I had to put my rod in the holder and stop the boat to net the 2 fish... I got the 2 walleye in the net at the same time... Sit down... Lift my rod outta the holder... Fish on... Lol... It picked it up off the bottom while I was netting the other fish....  After that  We headed to a local marina/restaurant for some burgers to fuel us up for the long trip I had planned...   We bounced around after that picking up one here and one there... Got one on a new spot...that is always great...  Then just as it gets dark (not kinda dark... I'm talking black....) I decided to try a spot... I haven't got a single walleye there all year... But my gut told me to try it...  We pulled 10 walleye outta this spot in about 1-1.5 hours.... All fish were 3+ lbs and 2 were 27"" And 7-8lbs...We were just at the right place at the right time....  We finished the night with 28 walleye boated and a handful of smallies... One around 4lbs... Dropped about 10 fish easily... Well... One of us did.... Lol  We were giggling like little kids all night... Lol...  I'm just glad I was with great friends when I hit this awesome day....  Here's a few highlights...        "

805879,Joeytier,2013-09-01 00:16:00,3990,Great stuff.  Maybe ill be adventurous enough to try the gulp on the harnesses someday.
805881,mike rousseau,2013-09-01 00:29:00,4661,Trust me.... They work great...   Especially anywhere there's gobies.... They destroy worms... But not the gulp

806204,kickingfrog,2013-09-03 18:18:00,8333,"Great day!   Gulp here for this guy too, or other scented plastics. More efficient, cheaper, cleaner and just as effective."
806213,Joeytier,2013-09-03 20:13:00,3990,"I use gulp minnows religiously, they work fantastic on walleyes, and even i can say theres still definitely a time and place where minnows/leeches cannot be beat.  I also dont have gobies/sunfish/any other panfish to contend with."
