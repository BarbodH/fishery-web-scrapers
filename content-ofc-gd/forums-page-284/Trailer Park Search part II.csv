Way back in the day I used to hunt moose in Kapuskasing. Since that camp fell apart I have not been hunting. If I could find a place to rent I think I'd like to get back into; deer, upland birds, turkey.  Any tips would be appreciated kris"

806234,krixxer,2013-09-03 22:34:00,274,Thanks Randy I know!  My master-plan is to find a park where I could keep my boat and 4x4. I'd like to use the place as a halfway house outside of the city.  As much as I like fishing I also need to do a little shooting a few time a year and that's where the idea of the crown land came in.
