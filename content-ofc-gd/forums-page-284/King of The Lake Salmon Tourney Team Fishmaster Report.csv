806216,Fishmaster,2013-09-03 20:47:00,920,"Thanks Justin ::: Well the weekend started on Thursday fishing in my aluminum off the bar. Started setting lines and before we could get them all in the water the braid diver takes a good rip with a glow pro troll and lime bubble glow ITO fly decent king to start the day    Finally got all 5 lines in the water 2 riggers pulling meat rigs 2 divers with pro troll flashers and ITO flys and our hail marry rig on the copper a 6 inch KJ special ITO fly  Next rod to fire was the wire diver back 100 over 65 fow on the ledge, very scrappy kings this morning! Managed to land him he fell victim to dew smart fish flasher and a key lime punisher ITO fly      Next we got our rigger bite goin back to back fish on our 11 inch glow pro troll flasher and meat rig down 55 over 85 fow    Picked away at kings all the way from the border to 4 mile creek and pulled lines in at 1 close to the border was the best, ended up 7 for 11 on the day  Big fish Friday:  We knew there was fish at the bar so that was gonna be our plan B, we wanted to find fish closer to home so we set up in 30 fow right in front of the canal Steve had a decent bite there the last few days, set 2 divers and 2 riggers and before we knew it we were doubled up on riggers both screamers, dropped the first one half way to the boat but after a long fight Lucas landed his fish it was a slob and it ended up being his first tyee! Landed a few more big matures then we pulled lines and left lol didn't want to beat on those fish and didn't want everyone to see us fishing there:p    Off to Jordan we went we had a good staging bite off the greenhouses last year so we decided to set up in skinny water and troll back towards Dalhousie. And it was slow decent screen but gin clear water and bites were few and far between.   At 1 pm we met the guys from shark cannon balls out in front of Dalhousie they had an underwater diver and wanted us to troll past for some footage of the cannonballs and our rigs, team rock and troll also participated, made a few good passes and headed in we had to wait and see what our big guy weighed on the tourney scale because Lucas's beard was on the line he had been growing it out all summer waiting for a tyee to shave it! Ended up being 31.3! Good dnough for 2nd place big fish friday, The beardwas comin off!!!  Congrats to Reel therapy and royal flush for there 1st and 3rd place fish  Before the tyee   After the tyee   He decided to keep the porn stash lmao  Saturday:  So we had our game plan and at the shotgun we headed to the canal and set lines in 35 fow again, same as Friday within minutes riggers were popping landed 4 decent matures but within the hour the bite died to we started to poke out a bit deeper because we saw some good teams fishing 45-65 fow, and on our way out we figured out our key program for the rest of the weekend double divers on each side pulling pro troll flashers and ITO flys! 2 high braid divers and deep wire divers they took 4 more big matures for us between 8 and 10 am. Our best rigs were a dew pro troll with a KJ special ITO fly and chrome 2 face echip with a lime bubble glow ITO fly thanks to rob ripka of team striker for bringing me that flasher:p our last bite of the day was a screamer on the copper with a 6 inch KJ special ITO fly he peeled a ton of line and sunk out line board then snap broke off at the backing - copper swivel, kind of a funny story but we ended up gettin our rig back from another fisherman that snagged our copper  Ended up with a solid box now jus wait and see what everyone else had we ended up with 110 lbs good enough for second place with 4 or 5 good teams behind us over 100 lbs and silver junkies with 117 lbs we knew we had our work cut out for us on day 2.  Sunday: headed right back to the canal and to our surprise only a handful of boats followed us as soon as we set lines we saw silver junkies triple up and saw Steve jablonski (fish dance) double up but we couldn't move a rod! It was disgusting lol we were pullin our hair out! We ended up catching 4 small fish under 15 lbs After an hour we decided we couldn't move the fish that they were catching so we moved out to our 45-55 fow way points and went back to our 4 diver 2 riggers spread, we hadn't taken a rigger shot since the previous morning we worked hard to try and find what they wanted on the riggers our dew coloured flashers were working so I found 10 inch dew spinny with crushed ice tape and a dew meat head as I was sending it down we doubled up on divers Steve and Luke grabbed those rods so I was gonna be net man Luke got his fish close to the boat and the dew spinny rigger pops I hook up with him now were tripled we landed all 3 fish and they were all upgrades to our box all 3 around 18-22 lbs,set back up and worked hard for the next few hours we had a decent box but we needed at least one more big upgrade Steve made up a new combo for the other rigger and 20 minutes after slamming it down it goes off and that was the upgrade we needed 28 lbs! On our last pass towards Dalhousie off the west corner of the canal in 40 fow a 180 copper that we made up Saturday night was up the shoot and it takes a hard whack with the 6 inch fly on it got it 50 ft behind the boat and saw it was another 25+ and it straightened a brand new owner 2x hook we figured we needed that fish to stay ahead of silver junkies and the other guys behind us but we still had another big box so we were happy with our day, our 2 rigger upgrades were what we needed but our divers pulling pro troll flashers and ITO flys were the key to success this weekend!  Headed to weigh in and heard mixed reports from guys so it was an agonizing wait to weigh in last we knew screamer had a huge box those boys tracked back n forth across the skinny water in front if the canal all day! And they hammere the kings lol we weren't sure about the silver junkies but we knew that they were great fisherman and it was gonna be tight we ended up with another 109 lb box and we edged out screamer and silver junkies!  Couldn't have won it with a better group of guys captain Steve hardcastle, Lucas dracz, and branden Kriter. Thx to Steve's finance Tanya for keeping us inline:p and cheering section of boaters on D dock!    Congrats to silver junkies on winning the overall king of the lake title they put in solid performances all year!  Congrats to team screamer putting 2 solid days together to take 2nd place this weekend.  Had an awesome year fishing the new Trojan and making some new friends! Yankee troller and striker can't wait to get Trojan row going again next year!"
