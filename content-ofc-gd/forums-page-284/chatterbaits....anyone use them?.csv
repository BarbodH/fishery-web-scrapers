805394,bigcreekdad,2013-08-28 21:28:00,546,"When I was on the French last week,  a father/son/son threesome in camp were using chatter baits almost exclusively. They did OK, but nothing spectacular. I had never heard of them, much less used them.  Anyone have any experience with these odd lures?"
805398,aplumma,2013-08-28 21:56:00,6896,I use them in place of spinnerbaits sometimes. They have there uses and in some areas they haven't been seen by the fish ad nauseum. Having a perch pattern and a white in the box can save the day.   Art
805400,Christopheraaron,2013-08-28 22:05:00,3525,I have one but no clue how to use it lol
805410,jedimaster,2013-08-28 23:03:00,3472,"Not too hard, just cast and retrieve. The quicker you go the shallower they run. Try running them on top of submerged weedbeds just ticking the top of the weeds, or alongside weed edges. They do work well but you have to put lots of casts in just like a spinner bait. Also try and mix up the trailer plastic you use. Sometimes that can make all the difference in the world."
805423,solopaddler,2013-08-29 00:18:00,8605,"I've used them a lot with very little luck.  Cool  bait though, I'm not ready to give up on them yet."
805427,Richie Razor,2013-08-29 00:55:00,536,"Never used em, but also see them on the clearance bins"
805428,jedimaster,2013-08-29 00:57:00,3472,I have found they are hit and miss. If the fish are chasing then they work awesome. If they are spooked or finicky they are just purdy to look at.
805435,Peps,2013-08-29 01:24:00,191,"I use them quite often, cast and retrieve, around stumps,docks,pads all with good success. It's all about confidence and it usually takes a couple of solid fish on a lure or technique to gain that confidence.  Give it a shot you'll be surprised..............."
805440,Dutch,2013-08-29 02:16:00,831,"I used them pretty much exclusively in place of spinner baits for bass.  I've had great luck with them on the way into the shallow spots I usually fish.  I used them with a trailer - they are a must.  Usually a Swammer or a Zoom Horny Toad (oopps did I say that out loud).  Horny toads are a great trailer, just cut the body down to fit the hook better.  I've had better luck with light colours than dark.  Yes - I see them a lot in clearance bins myself.  They have fallen out of favour, but are still really effective and a regular part of my bass arsenal."
805445,nexstar,2013-08-29 02:36:00,63,add a soft plastic swimbait to it and just retrieve it slowly. It's a deadly presentation.
805448,Ainsley,2013-08-29 02:55:00,142,I have a few in my jigs tray.  I have yet to throw one though. I'll have to try one of my keitech swimbaits on one. I've been throwing these swimbaits steady this summer.
805457,Woodsman,2013-08-29 04:36:00,1286,I have had good luck with them in the larger sizes for pike.
805459,BFSC Kevin,2013-08-29 04:42:00,1351,I used to prefer them over spinnerbaits. They do a nice wobble and you know there is a hit or snag when the wobble is interrupted.
805471,steelhead75,2013-08-29 09:34:00,35,"i have used them in salt water and had a tonne of sucess with them i first bought them in louisiana and the red fish love them.  then used them for pargo and snapper in cuba. i have caught a walleye on one in sturgeon lake,  the ones i have is like a rapala shape with the same lip as the plastic bait ones. the flash in the water is a great attractant.  baarcuda cant resist them but again anything flashy and fast is a barracuda meal."
805478,singingdog,2013-08-29 10:21:00,1047,"I never had much luck with them in lighter colors (white, chart), but have caught some great fish on them now that I am using craw patterns. My favorite is a 3/4 oz football jig that I converted to a chatterbait: dark green/brown with a craw trailer. I fish it like a crankbait, bouncing it off logs and rocks."
805538,mercman,2013-08-29 18:10:00,7054,I bought a bunch of BooYah chatterbaits last year on special at Sail. I tip them with Slammers and they are awesome for Bass and Pike.
805540,BillM,2013-08-29 18:28:00,17367," Spinnerbaits are the same way... if the blades get screwed up because of weeds, easy to feel (especially with braid)"
805566,Rich,2013-08-29 20:55:00,3927,"Mine constantly get destroyed by pike every September, catch lots of bass on them all summer but I have yet to get a big bass or big pike for that matter on one. Good for fast action."
805780,spinnerbaitking,2013-08-31 02:11:00,1622,"Nothing odd about them just buy a few different ones & try them they do work, LM & SM  plus Rockbass on them today, Yum chunks with crazy legs, I usually use Yellow or White with the odd Black if needed, Tight Lines SBK"
