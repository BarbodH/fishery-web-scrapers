875863,DanD,2014-10-08 10:47:00,2223,"Wouldn't fishing with this mink be the same as hunting with a ferret?  Don't know where this guy is from; I'm asking about here in Ontario.  Dan.  http://www.outdoorontario.net/AskMNR/mnrfaqgame.html  Question 165: Is it legal to use ferrets for rabbit hunting in ontario. I've heard alot of people say there illeagal but there are a few that say you can use them. I was wondering if you could clear this up. Asked August 20, 2003 Answer from the MNR It is illegal to use a ferret to hunt in Ontario."
