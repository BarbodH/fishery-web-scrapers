875902,James77,2014-10-08 17:08:00,175,"Hey Folks, Was out on Lower Buckhorn on Sunday and Monday Morning this week.  Sunday night I ran into two boats one with 6 people in it roughly, the other with one guy (supervisor?) in it. I spoke to the one guy, he said they were live trapping fish to study the lake, said they had a 16 pound musky, a bunch of walleye, some other cool fish marked that day.  He said they live release most of the fish.  Anyone have an idea who they might be? I was purely curious whether it was MNR or a University/College or if by chance someone was harvesting Walleyes.  I'm a bit confused.  What are the regulations on fishing with nets in Ontario?  James  PS. Was able to land a 4lb Large Mouth and a 34"" Musky while trolling. Weather wasn't co-operating with us.  "
875916,jbailey,2014-10-08 18:46:00,866,Probably work for the MNR or a conservation authority.  Are you sure they weren't electroshock fishing and just scooping the fish out with the nets when they float to the surface?
875919,James77,2014-10-08 19:02:00,175,"It was a really large net, they had 6 people in the boat pulling it in. It was strange because I was seeing them throw fish out of the net behind them, not tossing but like throwing them. If it was a conservation authority you think they'd treat all the fish with more respect.  I also thought if it was related to that the gentleman would have disclosed it."
875921,BillM,2014-10-08 19:04:00,17367,"That's a live release net, MNR uses them all the time."
875923,Sinker,2014-10-08 19:11:00,8692,"Sounds like a hoop net....or trap.  Could be MNR, or Fleming college students doing surveys.  Was the lone guy in a 20ft flatbottom with a big yammy on the back?  S."
875926,James77,2014-10-08 19:19:00,175,The lone guy had a 14' with a smaller merc. I just got a weird vibe.
875962,sofabed,2014-10-09 00:05:00,119,It's the local college or university ( i forget which one). They have been completing studies for a few weeks. I stayed at Beachwood a couple of weeks ago and they were staying at the resort as well. They have found some big bass in the lake.
875972,chris.brock,2014-10-09 01:46:00,4053,"Sounds weird, was it a 14' tinny or fiberglass? If fiberglass, what color boat?  I did stuff like that as a summer student job thing, we were always coached that we are in the public eye and how to conduct ourselves, tossing fish around isn't cool on the job or not  if your getting a weird vibe, likely you've got a cell phone, snap some pics"
876095,Kawartha Kev,2014-10-09 22:49:00,281,Without getting to specific where did you see the people doing the netting I have a cottage on Lower Buckhorn and am curious if it was out in the main channel or on the main lake or in some of the back bays no need to get to precise if you are worried about giving location.  Thanks Kawartha Kev  P.S. I am familiar with where Beachwood resort is.
876120,Big Cliff,2014-10-10 09:03:00,6899,"It is Fleming college students doing surveys. I have two of them staying with us doing their second year in fish and wild life.  I'll talk to them about the ""throwing fish"" and ask them to pass it on to their instructor that the public isn't impressed."
876207,206,2014-10-11 01:33:00,563,"Call me ignorant, but don't take this the wrong way....Were they Native? They have their own rules?"
876240,Big Cliff,2014-10-11 09:12:00,6899,"Call me ignorant, but don't take this the wrong way....Were they Native? They have their own rules? Did you read my post? IT IS FLEMING COLLEGE STUDENTS! It is part of their course and has nothing to do with being native or not."
