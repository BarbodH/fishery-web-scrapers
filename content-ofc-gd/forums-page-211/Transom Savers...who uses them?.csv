Just how hard was your buddy ramming that poor motor into the transom saver to produce that kind of pressure? lol  I think he almost might need a lesson in physics.

I agree, never ever crossed my mind until a very well known pro staff bass guy mentioned it the other day.  How tight should the motor be to the steel kind with the rubber pads?

875496,Old Ironmaker,2014-10-05 21:39:00,8243,"What is the physics behind "" pulling "" a boat off the trailer? Something I've never heard or gave a thought to  As for how much pressure to apply that's a good point, I have a tilt button on the side of my 115 so I drop the motor until it is snug, back it off and then snug it up again, that's it. I can see putting too much pressure on the hydraulics if you can' see the motor pushing against the ""Y"" in the bar. My pal has a 90 and has to use the tilt on the main control, it's tricky for him to do it solo."
875511,kickingfrog,2014-10-05 22:57:00,8333,"Not sure I see how any of that makes sense either and if the part about the straps did I'd still rather go through some of them at less then $50 a pop then a motor, boat or trailer."

If it's not snug, it's defeating the entire purpose of the transom saver in the first place."
875556,NANUK,2014-10-06 01:56:00,797,"Just snug is good enough, I always use bungee cord, Any "" pro staff "" claiming that a transom saver can pull the boat of the trailer is trying to push his sponsor product like ""My Wedge"" which might be called a ""motor hydraulics saver"" but does nothing to save your transom."
875566,irishfield,2014-10-06 03:34:00,26272,"If you're going to use them... make sure that your boat is absolutely tight to the winch post. If not when you slam on the brakes in a panic stop and the boat slides forward, that is when the transom is going to get damaged (or the engine's hydraulics or attachments). Myself, I will not use them on my 275 Verado on the advice of a well versed marine mechanic. That's what the trailering latch was designed for. Transom savers change the load path and will accelerate the wear of the engines pivot points. My 9.9 gets trailered in the down position and I throw a ratchet strap around it to the trailer so it doesn't bounce."
875568,Old Ironmaker,2014-10-06 03:59:00,8243,"Oh my, another thing to think about, damaging my pivot point and hydraulics as well as the boat flying off the trailer. If the winch strap, 2 ton safety chain and s hook break as well as both rear straps break I think I have more to concern myself than my boat flying off. My truck would probably doing 360's down the mountainside by then. I'm not sure what stress the pivot points and hydraulics have going at 5000 rpm but if I'm not too concerned with that I shouldn't be too concerned about some pressure on the hydraulics against the V in the transom saver. I don't think the hydraulics are under much pressure at all unless I forget to take my finger off the tilt control, yes, no? When I have absolutely nothing better to do and done everything else in life I'll put a pressure gauge on a hydraulic line and see what pressure the line is under when I set the transom saver. I'm going to guess that the bracket holding he pin for the transom saver will bend before the fuse goes for the hydraulic pump. After writing this it looks like I have nothing better to do already."
875576,BillM,2014-10-06 11:55:00,17367,Don't forget your safety chain breaking as well
875595,irishfield,2014-10-06 14:14:00,26272,"Look at it anyway you want and do what ever works for you to let you sleep at night. There is no need for the winch strap, safety chain or rear straps to break for the boat to move forward, if it hasn't been brought right tight to the winch post. Rear straps keep the boat from bouncing or going sideways off the trailer. They won't keep it from moving forward in a panic stop (the geometry won't allow it!) if the boat wasn't right tight to the post, which can be hard to do with a heavy boat on bunks if the water happened to be shallow at the launch."
875596,Fisherman,2014-10-06 14:16:00,7201,(the geometry won't allow it!) Exactly.
875601,hirk,2014-10-06 14:48:00,571,"The name is a misnomeaner, that hollow tube from the gearcase to the trailer wont save anything, it will as irishfield mentioned wear out you mount bushings due to the vibration being transmitted from the trailer to the gearcase because the trailer suspension causes the harmonics of the boat/trailer bouncing to be out of wack.There is far more stress and torque put on a transom running rough water than bumps on the road."
875603,Sinker,2014-10-06 15:10:00,8692,I've never used one and trailer my boat with the engine tilted all the way up for the last 21 years. Transom is as solid now as it ever was.  S.
875605,Mister G,2014-10-06 15:19:00,1429,If the boat is not right up against the trailer post I can't see how it would damage anything if it did slide up against the post on a quick stop unless that post is weak to begin with.

875334,BillM,2014-10-04 14:24:00,17367,I always use one on our F115 main.   As for the bolts?  No need to worry about anything coming loose (I'm not to sure how/why this would happen anyhow)

I no of 6-10 motors that have fallen off from guys not checking. Even Bob had 1 come off on Simcoe.  You can buy spacer to go on your steering racket to stop motor from leaning to the side. The smaller motors have a screw that you can tighten to reduce this problem."

There is a great write up on Proctor Marine website about the advantages of using one by Larry Mellor. I have seen transoms flexing while driving down the highway behind a boat. I can't see why anyone with anything heavier then a 9.9 wouldn't use one. I also strap a rubber bungee around the bottom of the lower unit to the end of the transom saver. I don't want to drop a transom saver on the road after hitting an unseen pot hole. Overkill? I don't know but Larry does it and I bought his boat so that's what I do too."

I always make sure my motor is turn all the way to the right so the steering rod is inside the motor while towing.

I was out with a guy the other day and he only uses the small bracket that takes pressure off the hydros and thats it.  He said the transom saver can push the boat off the trailer and place a lot of strain the the straps.  I use big boat straps so I guess i dont have that problem.  He also said the torque of the big motor and the force of waves and rough water is far worse than the force on the transom when trailering.  Anyone had 1 of these push a boat off a trailer"
