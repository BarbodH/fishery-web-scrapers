875362,mistaredone,2014-10-04 18:28:00,913,Snap traps are great to deal with your current problem but bait and kill stations are the only way to go for the long run. You can buy pet/kid safe ones at HD
875372,Cookslav,2014-10-04 19:59:00,1457,"We have an issue at my camp...not to much you can do out in the woods to keep them away really. But we employ the use of traps when we're there and the Buckets when we're not.  On the traps we've used peanut butter the abd had them licked clean as well. Nothing works better then a hunk of Cheese, or bread mashed onto the trigger before you set it. I've seen the little buggers pulling on it to get it...then SNAP We use the old fashin wire snaps and they work with nearly 100% effeciency when we bait them with mashed in cheese or bread. The key is to really ""mold"" it around the trigger so they have to pull on it.  BUT.... I have to tell you we recently tried those ""sonic"" plug in deterants on the market. Where we used to kill 7 or 8 each trip...we haven't seen a mouse since July. We leave them plugged in on a Solar battery system and the draw is so litle we've seen no issues. But I should tell you we used 4 units plugged in at strategic area's that we though they may be entering.  All I know is it ""appears"" to be working. We were 100% skeptical, but hey...if you have power it might be worth a shot. Its working for us. Cheers,"
875385,simonl,2014-10-04 21:38:00,28,"Cookslav, I am very interested in how you are running these. I have the same issues at my camp with mice and this year seems particularly bad! I have a solar/battery system that I power the camp with through an inverter when I am there. Do your sonic devices work on DC or do you have to leave an inverter on during your absence to run them? The only ones I have seen plug into an AC receptacle. I have always wondered about them. Glad to hear you are having success."
875388,ketchenany,2014-10-04 21:57:00,3229,"I have one(sonic) in my garage! Only a red light comes on? Did I buy a nightlight?

875594,Cookslav,2014-10-06 13:58:00,1457,"  Ours system is overkill for our needs, we have 6 monsterous 6V Batterys running off solar pannels which feed a 1500W inverter. I am not 100% what my 2 Pannels are rated as they were in place when I bought the place however I am fairly certain they are 500W each. All we have running off the system is lights and a few receptecles for a radio and recharging some electronics (GPS, Walkies etc...) although we do have a TV that seldom is used to check the local news, and sometimes we pick up the Odd Petes game... We're also wired with a generator to run the coffee maker/toaster in the morning and could recharge the batteries but have never needed to. The Guy I bought it from used to live there from April to December so I guess he was using more juice perhaps??? Anyway, We leave the Sonic units plugged in to the AC recpetecles with no issues what so ever. The draw of those 4 units is so insignificant that every time I come up to the camp the Batteries are still fully charged. I have a brother whom is an electrician and he checked out the units draw for me while he was there last time and in his oppinion the power comming in from the sun daily is more then enough to replenish their use and still top up the batteries.  I honestly did not beleive these things would work...but they seem to be...so far. One thing to note is being a ""sonic"" pulse it does not penetrate walls or even a chair. They are used ""directionaly"" meaning you can't plug it in and expect it to give coverage around walls, through doors etc.... Thats why I used 4 of them. We have one in basically each corner of the main floor which points to the other corners....more or less ensuring coverage along the perimeter of the cabin walls(inside of course). If you set them up make sure there is nothing in front of them or you will create a pocket where in theory there is no sonic deterent."
875597,Headhunter,2014-10-06 14:20:00,5703,"Make sense as high pitched frequencies are directional, low frequencies are not. HH"
875598,wallyboss,2014-10-06 14:23:00,1095,"Keep in mind that if you use the ""sonic ones""  that after a year or so of use ( it's usually stamped on it)  they don't work anymore.  They are great but they can get expensive."

The old school traps work great providing they're working properly and are set in the right place. Every other kill trap that's been invented since is basically another persons attempt at recreating the wheel.  Homemade tin can live traps also have a near 100% success rate when set properly in the right spot.

Sounds like you are getting things fine tuned. Yes, keep that peanut butter well back in the trap  so they have to get their head well in there before setting it off.

873843,Beans,2014-09-24 16:07:00,3339,Hey Mike...  These traps are fairly inexpensive 2/$4 @ Home Hardware and are easy to bait as long as you remember to hold the back end down while baiting...(a couple of sore fingers later...I learn the hard way)...LOL  Disposale is easy as you don't have to touch the mouse (works like a clothes pin)...and they are reusable  I'm thinking maybe putting a gob of peanut butter in a roe bag and tying it to the trigger as my next move...  Then I might try buying some sticky paper traps and put the baited traps in the middle of those...sort of a double whammy !!  My granpappy is probably looking down and laughing his a$$ off...he used to trap muskrats in the winter in the swamp at our farm...

Set up a 5gal bucket with a clothes hanger wire across the opening, threading an old toilet paper roll length-wose on it so it spins around the wire.  Fill bucket 1/4 with anti-freeze, smoother some PB on the roll and set up a ramp(s) using old pieces of wood up the side of the bucket.

This one FAILED (Victor Rodent Trap):  This one worked (Wilson Predator):    This one worked (Victor Tin Cat) as long as it was put in the correct spot.  It had five mice in it when I cleaned it out:  Honestly, I think the snap traps have a high fail rate regardless of which ones you use.    They are fairly cheap though so you can set up a bunch.   The live trap is probably the best and unfortunately the most expensive."

Do not put the peanut butter on the trigger, put it up inside the lid above the trigger, works every time and you always get a good clean kill that way. I keep 4 of those traps set around here at all times and don't even use the old wood ones anymore.  Also, put them near a wall with the open side facing the wall so the mouse has to enter it from the side of the trap, again it will increase your catch/kill rate.  let me know how that works for you."

Our cottage has a hole in the foundation to which my father has spent 6 years now attempting to plug, yet somehow the little critters consistently come into the crawlspace year round. The only preventative measure is to literally continuously set a swath of traps every cottage visit. Basically its like the Iron dome of mouse traps. You gain access but before you have time to set up camp and breed, you die.  I have an odd situation in my semi detached home as well. I am about 90% certain my unsanitary neighbor has mice in his home regularily as about once every couple of years a mouse finds its way into the one internal wall that is open that runs the plumbing from my upstairs bathroom down to the basement. There is once access panel that goes under the bathtub, and sure enough every couple of years a mouse finds its way up into my upstairs bathroom and decides that the garbages and our closets are nice places to roam at night.  Luckily both times the critters have woken me up in the early morning crawling through the trash can in my bedroom. I then chase them back into the plumbing wall in the bathroom, fill the plumbing area with poising and set the great wall of scott up   Works so well i dont even need bait.  As an FYI both of these traps seen are ""the same"" the manufacture discontinued the ones with the red V...turns out they are the only ones that really work, hence my use of them in the kill zone.  For anyone out there, my dad and I have been setting mouse traps every weekend for 5 years straight, My dad has literally purchased every single product from home hardware available and the most consistant killer are the victor traps with the red V. The new ones just dont seem to be as touchy."
