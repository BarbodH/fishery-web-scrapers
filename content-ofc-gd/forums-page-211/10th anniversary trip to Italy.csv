875509,kickingfrog,2014-10-05 22:51:00,8333,"Married for 10 years and together for 16, my wife really wanted a big trip to celebrate. My suggestion of a remote fly-in for some fins and feathers was only half in jest but I don't even think it made the long list, let alone the short one. I knew our October wedding was going to cause some conflicts for me and the fall fishing and hunting but the thought of stewing in my own juices inside a tux for a summer wedding was even less attractive 10 years ago.  AirMiles account cleaned out, kids off to the grandparents' and we're heading to Pearson for our 9 hour, 6 time zone flight to Rome. A few days there and then a <2 hour train ride (Trains are the cat's behind in Europe) to Florence. A few more days and then another train to Venice before flying home and some sleep before Ryan's first ever organized hockey practice this morning.   10 of the 2000 odd photos I took since any guide/tourist book will have better ones, but these are some I liked the first time through:  Rome     Florence        Venice   Ambulance. Things only move via boat, handcart or foot.       The little fish market ^above^ is on the middle/bottom right and the we had a great seafood meal at the restaurant with the little oval yellow sign just above the market's tarp. The black and red boat in the middle of the canal is a bus.   The trip was incredible. The food was awesome. The only real language issue was when I tried to use my very limited italian (One waiter actually turned is head like a dog and said ""What?"" in perfect English.  Boy they smoke over there like it's an Olympic sport though.  Now time to get some birds and fish of my own.  "
875513,spincast,2014-10-05 23:00:00,3279,cool trip; great shots. Congrats on the decade of marital bliss. Maybe for your 20th you can swing the nature adventure trip? If you start now......
875517,captpierre,2014-10-05 23:15:00,2521,nice.  could've trolled a Rapala behind the gondola
875520,Rich Clemens,2014-10-05 23:30:00,3131,Great trip Rob.  Don't be shy in sharing some of the other pics
875522,davey buoy,2014-10-05 23:33:00,5505,"What history,and a completely different world I could imagine.Thanks for sharing,and congrats on the 10th.!!!!!!"
875528,kickingfrog,2014-10-06 00:07:00,8333,nice.  could've trolled a Rapala behind the gondola  Not for the 100 Euro they charge for a ride.
875560,Moosebunk,2014-10-06 02:15:00,3970,With those pics a real teaser that was Rob.  Incredible place it must have been to visit.  Congrats on 10 dood!
875571,Old Ironmaker,2014-10-06 04:22:00,8243,"Yep that's Italia. They sure don't live like we do. Listen, by the time it's your 20th your wife may encourage you to celebrate with hunting and fishing, maybe even without her."
875575,kickingfrog,2014-10-06 11:42:00,8333,"That's for sure. The time change is one thing but the 8-9pm start time for dinner (and you can't eat out in less then 2 hours, because the staff expect you to linger, have a conversation and savour the food) really doesn't suit me normally. It was great for a vacation without little kids but at home I like to be done dinner by 6pm. I'm getting kinda set in my ways as I get older."
875606,Dara,2014-10-06 15:28:00,3052,Looks like a nice trip.  I was there 30 years ago with the wife...brings back good memories
875669,silveradosheriff,2014-10-07 00:23:00,1025,Great pics - thanks for sharing!
875764,Shloim,2014-10-07 20:30:00,515,I was there myself 22 years ago while backpacking. Likely a different trip mine involved alot more PB&J sandwiches and chasing a lot of girls with very limited success. Awesome pictures...
