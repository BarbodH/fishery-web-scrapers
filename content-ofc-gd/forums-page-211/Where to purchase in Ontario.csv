I have seen them on Amazon and ebay etc. I am not in the mood to spend triple the cost for this item in shipping from the US. Thanks  Ken"

875773,aquarianwolf,2014-10-07 21:04:00,9,Bass Pro Shops too.
875789,Gerritt,2014-10-07 21:41:00,6129,Honda powersports should be able to get them as well.

875798,irishfield,2014-10-07 21:57:00,26272,"Princess Auto for about 5 bucks! and if the thread is not right for your motor..... one of those multi cut caps for a tube of silicon fits one of the adapters in the pump kit and will fit any size hole in your lower unit, just cut to suit! You can also use the plastic applicator from a hemorrhoid cream tube."

875851,chris.brock,2014-10-08 07:54:00,4053,"Is that tool necessary? I just cut the tip off the gear oil, push it in the threaded hole, and slowly squeeze, catch the drips in a rag"

I just cut the tip off the gear oil, push it in the threaded hole, and slowly squeeze, catch the drips in a rag  that works too.   little cleaner and less waste with the pump and the fitting but i did my lower unit just like you describe for a couple of seasons."

876130,Mister G,2014-10-10 11:58:00,1429,"The hand pump kit that actually screws into the lower unit is much better tool then trying to squeeze a tube into the lower unit, especially if the outboard is of the larger variety and holds quite of bit of lower unit oil.  Remember, if you purchase the proper tool now it will serve you for the rest of your fishing life and make the job much easier. Quality tools are worth their weight in gold IMHO and they only cost more next year."
