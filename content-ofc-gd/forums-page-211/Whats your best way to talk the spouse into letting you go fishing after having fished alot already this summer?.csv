875302,Sharkbait22,2014-10-04 01:30:00,297,"Like already said it's not about permission but courtesy, especially for overnight(s) trips. If you don't have kids then there is less of an issue. I hear young guys talk tough ""she knew I love fishing when we met"".  I usually laugh and say ""good luck with that"".  That's all fine, but try having a fun guilt-free trip when she is at home dealing with kids or whatever.  She may ask about your priorities as she is exhausted and ready to throw in the towel. She needs help. Face it, children fundamentally change your life but in many ways for the good.  The Kitchen Pass method works well and as the kids get older you'll have more free time and possibly include them in the fishing. Grandparents and family can be very helpful. In the meantime you may find yourself on some internet site loosely about fishing.  Another word of advice is understanding that a fathers free time is precious because he probably gets so little, so be on time for fishing."

Shloim it's not to late, you absolutely have to stop looking at you doing something you love by only getting permission to do it. A lot of us out here have many years of service in the field of domestic relationships, hell I've been married for 42 years, 3 different women but it all counts. My future ex wife and I have been together for 23, so I'm finally doing something right for a change, like loving her madly because she doesn't want to change me and she told me off the top ""I'm not your Mother"". If I don't hold up my part of the bargain it will be future ex for certain. If what you are saying is that perhaps a day out on the water isn't in the budget well that's different, your asking permission to risk going into the red. Fishin ain't cheap.  It's compromise my friend otherwise it will be hell, for a very long time, or a short time, your choice."

So that will never change !!!!   But I have had friends that have to ask permission to do anything well that doesn't go over well with me that's for sure !!!! All I ask is that if there is some commitment I need to attend or she would like me to do something to give me plenty of warning days or even a week or 2 in advance !!! As my weekends from march till November are always booked up for fishing !!!! And then it's snowmobiling and she is used to that now ...... So it's all good"

It isn't about asking permission, it is about being courtious and considerate of the other person. Sue would never say NO but she might point out that we already had another comittment that neaded to be taken into consideration.

So I'm going to call it a stroke of genius some may call it desperation, but I figured it out. I asked my zone if he'd want to go if we brought one of his buddies and he went for it.
