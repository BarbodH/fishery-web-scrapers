876135,woodenboater,2014-10-10 12:30:00,2277,you can probably get a propane shop to make up an adapter or get one of those Coleman distribution posts. kinda tall but lets you attach several items to one tank
876136,Terry,2014-10-10 13:09:00,14456,There are adapters
876138,NANUK,2014-10-10 14:15:00,797,"Adopters are available, I have seen them at Home Depot ."
876142,quickme,2014-10-10 14:51:00,261,"we can work out a trade ( ice fishing stuff, etc) .  for the stoves."
875775,gaspumper,2014-10-07 21:07:00,393,"Anyone looking for 5 lb tanks Madoc Home Hardware has them all ready filled for $47.50,after you empty them any refill station can refill them,tanks are good for 10 years."
875777,davey buoy,2014-10-07 21:10:00,5505,"That seems pricey?,I know it's convenience,but can't you get a 20lb new and full for in and around that price?.Interesting,maybe my numbers are off."
875782,cheaptackle,2014-10-07 21:17:00,849,"Supply & demand - 5lb have always been comparatively MORE than 20lb - they make & sell a gazillion times more 20 lb than they do 5lb.  That's IF you can find them, not a whole lot of availability which is why many people refill the 1lb ones - and that's a whole other discussion that's been hashed out many times.  Michael"
875783,misfish,2014-10-07 21:18:00,29133,"You drag around a 20 pounder all winter Davey.LOL  Thanks for the heads up.  I,ll be checking my local store and see if they can bring them in."
875784,misfish,2014-10-07 21:23:00,29133," And I for one,will not try this practice. Power to those that do and have luck with it.  Cabelas has thier green bottles on for $4.23 each. I still have 6 from last year when wally world had 3 for $10."
875785,Roy,2014-10-07 21:26:00,13728,I don't nor ever have used 5lb tanks. But I can buy a 20lb tank and fill it for $42. so how come 5 pounders are so expensive?
875786,davey buoy,2014-10-07 21:32:00,5505,"You drag around a 20 pounder all winter Davey.LOL  Thanks for the heads up.  I,ll be checking my local store and see if they can bring them in. I think you missed the point Brian,who would ever carry a 20lb'r unless they have the means to.I use a coleman stove to heat and cook on the ice.Light and fits wellm in the bottom of the sleigh"
875788,misfish,2014-10-07 21:38:00,29133,"I don't nor ever have used 5lb tanks. But I can buy a 20lb tank and fill it for $42. so how come 5 pounders are so expensive?   Heres my thinking.  I would sooner pay that high price,yes as outrages as it may be, and have no answer to why they charge that amount (I can get it refilled safely) and not fill the land fill with green bottles. That,s my answer."
875793,irishfield,2014-10-07 21:53:00,26272,I use a 20 lbr on the ice all winter!  ..and if you don't like filling 1 lbrs Bri... you could fill 5's the same way ! lol

875826,porkpie,2014-10-08 00:51:00,2521,"$47 is pretty much standard for a 5 or 11lb tank.  Expensive, yes, but its been that way for years."
875831,livinisfishin,2014-10-08 01:33:00,661,I have been using a 5lber for a couple years now. Was a little pricey up front but works great with my single tank top heater and is small and light for transporting in the sleigh.

I am now interested,who sells the tank top burner/heater at a good price?.They screw on the top of the tank I believe and you could put a small pot on top to cook?,if that's what I'm thinking."

876038,Stoty,2014-10-09 15:22:00,2910,I picked up two 5lb tanks for $40 off Kijiji in the spring.

876068,Terry,2014-10-09 18:55:00,14456,"are they made for 1lb tank or 5 lb tank, as they have different fittings"
876069,quickme,2014-10-09 18:59:00,261,now that you've mentioned it I think they may be for 1lbs but I'll check when I get home with my 5lb/20lb tank.

876083,misfish,2014-10-09 20:26:00,29133,Those are for the 1pound. I have the same ones.
876107,livinisfishin,2014-10-10 00:49:00,661,My heater is from princess auto when they were on sale. Ive never tried cooking on it but im sure you could. I just traded my portable shack and buddy heater this summer because i never used them. On the really cold days where i feel like i need a heater i just plunk the tank in the snow and blast the heat right at me. I found that just having the tank top heater made all the difference. Being on the tank its up higher and is just at the right level when sitting. It also works well for keeping ice off of your line when jigging and keeps my hand toasty when tying up a new lure.
876127,quickme,2014-10-10 11:48:00,261,the stoves are for 1lbers.  It would have been nice for them to work with my 5lber.
876129,davey buoy,2014-10-10 11:55:00,5505,the stoves are for 1lbers.  It would have been nice for them to work with my 5lber. I guess no adapter available?.
