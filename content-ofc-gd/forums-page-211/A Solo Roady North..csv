Another great adventure with some awesome miles put on that Rebel...way to go. I also have a healthy respect for the lake conditions on Forgan and Lake Nip.

F.W.I. the tagged fish is not mine (I only tag on the right side). I did very little tagging in that area, choosing to leave it alone over the years. However the MNR went in there last fall and ""sampled"" the area by netting and tagging. I haven't heard the results of that study as my biologist contact who ran the tagging program has retired. Hopefully someone in the MNR will take over responsibility, but I suspect the tagging program has run its course and I'm done this year anyway. I really enjoyed the read and the determination to take on such a solo adventure. My compliments. So I won't see you again next year??? Yea, right."

873053,Sinker,2014-09-18 14:33:00,8692,Do you ever get any info back on those tagged fish?  Kinda like a banded goose/duck...its always the info that amazes me the most.  S.
873176,Wagoneer,2014-09-19 16:11:00,118,Is this legal? I always thought you had to be MNR or part of a government cleared scientific study to tag any animal? Or do they contract tagging out to fisherman to clear a budget?

Your boat is waaaay too sexy for running in that Forgan mine field Al.  Thanks for the reply... and you ""probably"" will see me again.  It is sorta planned to go back in 2015 as it's hard to imagine missing a year there.   BTW leave the red head for me!   She asked about ya Mike.   Bears encounters are always something to be aware of, Never let your guard down.  That one in your campsite must of had the cheeks puckered up a bit!!   Too busy being angry that it dared walk in my wilderness.   I don't get around much on the forums anymore but when I do its nice to see you're still getting out and sharing your experiences. Great report as always Bunk   Thanks Les.  Good to hear you're still checking in.   Do you ever get any info back on those tagged fish?Kinda like a banded goose/duck...its always the info that amazes me the most.   Didn't report on the tags this year Shane but did last year on every one, and yes, the MNR biologist up there heading up the tagging program contacted me to return the info each time.  Also, my best fish over the years was a tagged fish that had been caught and released several times over the course of her five year life, 2004-2009.  Various stages of her growth recorded and the places she was found.  It is the only speck I have kept from the lake and it was awesome to have her life history which I added to a little plaque that accompanies the mount.   Wow...are u ever ugly. Just fish pics please. Nice report.   Uglier every year... inside and out.  Thanks man!   BTW, if you liked Three Day Road, you will enjoy Boyden's second novel, ""Through Black Spruce.""  Read ""Through Black Spruce"" first, Boyden did an amazing job researching and capturing life on James Bay, many parts and characters truly depicted.  Just finished ""The Orenda"" in Attawapiskat and it's worth the read as well.  I'll take you up on your offer too Doug.  We'll hopefully talk soon.   Thank all."

Also noticed the specs in there were a bit on the small side, never had any luck with big snakes though.   I've fished Bonner as well, but it was way too late in the year for it.  7 years Bill... some summer's multiple trips.  Wouldn't say it's more or less busy really.  Some trips I'm surprised and hardly anyone is around, other trips are a zoo.  This one was relatively quiet overall.  More laker guys out there than speckleheads in June/July.  Agree though that Forgan is nasty... 90 to 5 is a familiar teeth gnasher in there for sure.  I have never done a trip to Nip in July. Fishing for Brookies would definitely be a challenge that time of year.  The first camp site, did you see the Moose skulls and hides? Looked like they were there from last fall. It is a great secluded camp site. No matter which way the wind blows. It's a great area for going solo in my opinion. Done it a few times now.  Didn't really go as much for specks but just kinda ended up fishing them Ron.  Wanted more than anything to find a decent vertical jig bite some place, working lakers like I'd just done so on Slave and through the winter on Nipigon. Second to that, wanted some pike action as there was no planned pike/eye trip this summer. Too tough on Nip this time around for the laker jig so ended up putting time in on specks.  Water temps 58-65 through the week made that easier.  You and Keith want to plan something for camping on the Skake sometime, I'm game!  Skulls and hides...?  Awesome trip report!

A ""tale"" is all it was too... everything including the photos all fiction.  Haha fooled ya little buddy, and thanks!  Its only 3.5 hours from my front door.  l.....you are a brave man for venturing out there solo...cudos...that lake scares me!!!  We got to hook up for some GIANT pike fishing some time!!  3.5 hours!!!  Heck, I'd commute to work and live there.  Would like to get a BIG pike trip with a BIG group together sometime in the future Jay.  A pike/eye mix especially, is always a recipe for a good vacation.  Your 652 lake holding that big girl... wonder how she'd measure up today?  When I think,can your fishing expeditions get any better,you post this.  Haven't the time right yet Brian and expected come Wednesday to get hit with one of the heaviest workloads I've had in years, but a buddy and I just returned from Northern Saskatchewan on Saturday... the lake trout but especially some of the scenery photos had my jaw on the floor yesterday.  It's coming...    Thanks gang!"
