875855,misfish,2014-10-08 09:44:00,29133,Raining. What else is new.
875856,Handlebarz,2014-10-08 09:45:00,3790,Looks good here it's about 1/4 covered but my cell camera will not pick up the dark side. Good luck to everyone fishing today
875858,davey buoy,2014-10-08 10:19:00,5505,"I'm in Burlington,looking good!"
875859,Handlebarz,2014-10-08 10:30:00,3790,Totally covered now from the top of the ambassador bridge.
875862,misfish,2014-10-08 10:44:00,29133,I just caught a look at it. The clouds finally moved out. Just a sliver left. Very cool.
875865,ketchenany,2014-10-08 11:11:00,3229,Had a great view in Woody. Watched the whole thing.
875870,Terry,2014-10-08 12:15:00,14456,Got to see it real  well but my iPhone did not do well taking a picture of it.
875871,BillM,2014-10-08 12:18:00,17367,Clouds cloud and more clouds.
875872,misfish,2014-10-08 12:21:00,29133,"Bill  When the clouds cleared, it was right out your front door. I surprised you didn't get pics.  YA my cell couldn't pic it up either. To many lights around."
875873,BillM,2014-10-08 12:23:00,17367,I guess I went to bed too early
875894,Dara,2014-10-08 16:10:00,3052,"Thats so romantic....the whitefish out ""spawning"" in the moonlight"
875899,Rodwrap,2014-10-08 16:52:00,130,"out ""spawning"" in the moonlight  Those days ( nights) are over.."
875925,can u fish,2014-10-08 19:17:00,326,Cloudy and rain here could not see anything.
875933,Rodbender,2014-10-08 20:59:00,1027,I had the camera in the truck going to work this morning every time I'd pull over off the 401 clouds would come in pulled over 4 times then had to say Forkit gonna be late
875935,spincast,2014-10-08 21:35:00,3279,we managed to catch a few glimpses of it as it started. A shame we don't have a more powerful lens as for about 10 minutes we had a beauty clear view.  Then it slipped behind the trees  
875939,davey buoy,2014-10-08 21:45:00,5505,Pretty good shots for what your view was!!
875942,misfish,2014-10-08 22:21:00,29133,The last shot is what I got to see. Nice going.
