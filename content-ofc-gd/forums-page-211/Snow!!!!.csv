Only available on line and I am not responsible for any wrong information in this post, check it out yourselves.  Personally...I can't wait for the trails to open"
875791,Joeytier,2014-10-07 21:50:00,3990,"OFSC trails around here are terrible compared to the trails across the border in QC...which are absolutely amazing, but even pricier than Ontario"
875819,Steelheadphycho,2014-10-08 00:25:00,470,"We in bro-hio are not so lucky (at least here in the canton area) to have dedicated snow mobile trails. But did I read prior posts correctly, you have to pay $180 for permit to ride them?!?! Nah....... No thanks! My wife and kids have walked them and they are very nice but $180 nice? Man I dont know."
875837,Dara,2014-10-08 02:20:00,3052,"Well, I ride in Ontario and Michigan...Mi permit is $45.00  Ont is $240 after Dec 1...still worth it  My sled gets 4,000 km a year"
