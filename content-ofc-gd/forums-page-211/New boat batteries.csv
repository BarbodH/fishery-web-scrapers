876196,Fisherman,2014-10-11 00:01:00,7201,"http://""People kill more deep cycle batteries with poor maintenance practices, than die of old age!"" Lead sulfation actually starts when you remove the charging voltage a lead-acid battery. The lead sulfate crystals are converted back to lead during the normal charging cycle. The real question is, if all of the lead sulfate crystals are not turned back into lead, how long does it take before they become so hard that they can not be converted? The answer is that varies--it could be weeks or months and depends on a number of factors such as the quality of the lead, temperature, plate chemistry, porosity, Depth-of-Discharge (DoD), electrolyte stratification, etc. Porosity is a measure of how porous the plates are. During the normal discharge process, lead and sulfur combine into soft lead sulfate crystals are formed in the pores and on the surfaces of the positive and negative plates inside a lead-acid battery. When a battery is left in a discharged condition, continually undercharged, the electrolyte level is below the top of the plates, or the electrolyte is stratified, some of the soft lead sulfate re-crystallizes into hard lead sulfate and it cannot be reconverted during subsequent recharging. This creation of hard crystals is commonly called permanent or hard ""sulfation"". When it is present, the battery shows a higher voltage than its true voltage; thus, fooling the voltage regulator or smart charger into thinking that the battery is fully charged. This causes the charger to prematurely lower its output voltage or current, leaving the battery undercharged. If a wet lead-acid battery is not periodically recharged, undercharged or not properly maintained, sulfation will account for approximately 85% of premature battery failures. The longer sulfation occurs, the larger and harder the lead sulfate crystals become. The positive plates will be light brown and the negative plates will be dull, off white. These crystals reduce a battery's cranking performance, capacity, and ability to hold a charge or be recharged. This occurs deep cycle and some starting batteries are typically used for short periods, seasonal powersports or applications, vacations, weekend trips, etc., and then are stored the rest of the year to slowly naturally self-discharge. Most starting batteries are normally used several times a month, so sulfation rarely becomes a problem unless they are undercharged or the plates are not covered with electrolyte. As a consequence of parasitic (key-off) loads or natural self-discharge, permanent sulfation occurs as a wet lead-acid battery discharges while in long term storage. Parasitic load is the constant electrical load present on a battery while it is installed in a vehicle even when the power is turned off. The load is from the continuous operation of appliances, such as an emmissions control unit, clock, security system, maintenance of radio station presets, etc. While disconnecting the negative battery cable will eliminate a parasitic load, it has no effect on the natural self-discharge of a lead-acid battery. Self-discharge is accelerated by temperature. For batteries that are over 77째 F (25째 C), the self-discharge rate doubles with a 18째 F (10째 C) rise in temperature. Thus, sulfation is a huge problem for wet lead-acid batteries not being used, sitting on a dealer's shelf, or in a stored vehicle, especially in HOT temperatures."
876220,NANUK,2014-10-11 03:21:00,797,"LOL The wonderful world of www has an endless supply of cut & paste information and some wonderful theories In a perfect world under perfect conditions, an on board charger should perform as good as the description on the box, BUT in reality, there are too many variables, like quality/make of charger, condition of batteries, wiring, location and embient temprature (or in some cases a closed compartment temprature during charging) etc. I deal with 36v auto floor scrubbers on almost daily bases, all have 12v heavy duty commercial duty deep cycle batteries and come with state of the art microprocessor controlled automatic chargers. I have seen a few ""cooked"" batteries and heard of a few fires because on board charger was left plugged in, Had endless discussions with battery wholesaler and technician, nobody can argue that in theory an on board charger is better and very convenient, but in reality there are too many variables like I mentioned above. Mybe its just me, but I just don't like to take my chances with today's offshore made ""reliable"" electronics. Besides, I figure if every time before charging, I have to open the battery compartmant, battery box and the compartment where the on board charger is mounted (ventilation), I would be better off to just use a good quality portable charger with charge rate and charge level display, I have it sitting somewhere where I can read this information every time I open the garage. and disconnect it when the battery is fully charged.  Do whatever works for you, specially if you are getting over 10 years out of a single battery, To be honest, I have never heard of such long usefull deep cycle battery life.  To each his own."
876223,irishfield,2014-10-11 03:32:00,26272,"8 summers on my deep cycles in the bow of my Lund... they're about done, but from neglect. 8 summers on the AGM's for the Verado and kicker motor and they still load test as new. Battery in our steel boat w / 25 Honda.. 9 years / 10th summer and it load test as new. Moral to the story... use your boat!  As for leaving chargers plugged in overnight or 24/7... like Stonefish... not a chance! As matter of fact I forgot that I plugged my cordless 18v battery in yesterday morning and opened the shop to lithium ion gas today and a liquid pool of battery goo, deformed charger and melted battery pack. Thank god I set it on my steel jig table, although I found it all on the floor. Got so hot and bubbling I guess it hopped itself right off the table!"
876241,Mister G,2014-10-11 09:32:00,1429,I must be the lucky one because my boat has been on charge when not fishing for over 15 years. But that's what everyone says when we go fishing too.  Last cranking battery was 9 years old and I only changed it out because it was 9 years old.  Life is good and my on-board charger makes it even easier and one less thing to worry about.
874525,icefisherman,2014-09-29 14:49:00,952,"Well the time has come...after 9 years one of my Sears DieHard deep cycle batteries gave me problems on Saturday. Had to use jumper cable and the other battery to start my main motor at end of day. So I am thinking it maybe time to replace both of them, Both were made in 2005. Any idea where can I find same battery? Needles to say I am happy with them and see no reason to change. If they are not available locally my other choice would be the Costco ones as they come with very good warranty and decent price. Any other ideas or comments?  Thanks,  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
874674,misfish,2014-09-30 09:28:00,29133, Save time and gas and go to Costco. Lots of boaters using their batteries. Have not heard of any complaints.
874678,Wagoneer,2014-09-30 10:32:00,118,The diehards are really hard to find in Canada. I've gone in to sears with a part number and they tell me that it's not a Canadian part number. They seem to stock them at random times and the not carry them for years.  I've been super impressed with my kirkland deep cycle from Costco. It goes through hell being used as my trolling motor battery. My dad also uses four on his boat. He uses a single deep cycle (not the starter/deep cycle combo one they sometimes carry) as the starter battery for his 150 and she's never had a problem starting. Value-wise you just can't beat the costco flooded batteries.
874688,DanD,2014-09-30 12:05:00,2223,"Kirkland batteries are manufactured by Johnson Controls, which is a well respected company; that manufacture batteries for a number of different labels. These batteries are not built to Cosco's specifications; but to their cost point. In other words Costco tells Johnson Controls we want X number of batteries and are only willing to pay you this. From there Johnson Controls builds the best battery they can too meet that cost point. When you see a Kirkland battery on sale, make sure you check a few things before you buy. What is the CCA/MCA, the amp hour and the reserve capacity of this battery, compared to their regular priced battery. If not sure pick up each one of the batteries the heavier battery is the better one; more or thicker lead plates. The other thing too check is the date code that is heat stamped onto the top or around the top edge of the battery. Johnson control battery's date code reads like this. It'll likely be a 4 digit like 2B1A. It's the first 2 digits you want; the first is the year number 1 - 0 repeating every 10 years. The second is the month code. A -M skipping I. So the code on the battery above would have been made in Feb of 2002. You wouldn't want to buy a 3 - 8 or 10 year old battery, especially that they've been on a shelf wet with acid. Just know what you're buying and almost any of today's batteries will work well for you.  There's only something like 5 lead acid battery manufacturers here in North America Dan.  "

They were still asking full price.  It was a deep cycle, but I have used deep cycles for starting a 55hp before.  I am not sure if they would work for a larger engine.  I think most places will be out of stock and will not be restocking until spring.  I was there again and they had five Marine/RV batteries; a mix of deep cycle and starting.  Still full price though."

876132,Mister G,2014-10-10 12:11:00,1429,A good smart on-board charger is just as important as what battery you choose. And it should be plugged in at all times when not fishing.
876151,NANUK,2014-10-10 16:31:00,797,"A smart on board charger is convenient but not important for keeping your battery charged and healthy, Any good automatic charger with proper charging rate (Amps) can do the job, Deep cycle batteries have to be charged quickly after use, but you don't have to have the charger plugged in at all the time after the battery has been fully charged."

I've got a couple over 10 years old, I keep mine on a maintainer plugged in constantly when not in active use. Yes, I agree.........especially since there are many old type chargers that will give you a quick charge or even start your vehicle but will also overcharge and boil out your battery....NOT GOOD ! ! !  With the new Smart Chargers that most on-board chargers are nowadays they not only charge said battery(s) but also go to their de-suffocation mode and then into a maintain mode for the rest of the time. Money well spent when you consider how much each of these batteries cost X3.......  And yes, I agree with stonefish that they are extremely convenient and that also makes them a wise choice."
