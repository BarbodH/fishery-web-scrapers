874878,Tim Mills,2014-10-01 12:16:00,476,Apparently some guys at the station were asking him about the car while he was filling up and he wasn't paying attention.  He says he over filled by 3 or 4 ounces and the next thing he hears a couple of pops and see's flames...  guess he'll have to carpool it down to Bay St.

875024,Steve,2014-10-01 23:31:00,2075,"porche is offering a free new vehicle if he doesn't sue them.  the engine is in the rear, but wasn't designed properly. if gas over spilled, the engine compartment should have protection to keep the gas from hitting the engine and igniting.  I'm quite sure he'll pass on the free replacement and sue however.  I'm sure the gas station's insurer will also sue porche for damages.  interesting situation."

875336,Steve,2014-10-04 14:42:00,2075,"you have to find negligence.  they ""may"" find the driver slightly negligent, as he did ""squeegie"" the gas towards the back where the engine was....however, 99% of vehicles could have gas spilled on the hood of the car and not do that.....  porche is backpedaling as we speak."
875404,FloatnFly,2014-10-05 00:50:00,1640,but was the driver in THAT much of a hurry he couldn't turn his car around so the passenger side as facing the pumps?
875461,Old Ironmaker,2014-10-05 16:14:00,8243,"I don't think you drag the hose across a million dollar car. I won't on my $1500.00 car. He could have thrown a gallon of fuel on the car and he wouldn't be 100% liable, cars aren't supposed to catch fire when fuel touches it, it's not a Pinto or Corvair."
