Can't beat glass-calm water, a LiveTarget frog, and hungry fall largies.(watch in 1080p HD for best quality)Cheers,Justin"

875929,misfish,2014-10-08 20:41:00,29133,"Had to wait til I got home to watch Justin. As you know,I like watching your bass adventures.  That first spot with the scattered pads. Those are my favorite kind of spots.  On to 3:34.  Kinda reminded me of a baseball game. Swing batta batta batta swing.  Like you said. Not a big one,but still fun to catch.  Thanks buddy."

875937,JustinHoffman,2014-10-08 21:42:00,482,"Thanks for the comments, guys - much appreciated. Was definitely a fun day on the water. Was fishing scattered vegetation in water between 3 and 5 feet deep. As for the fish at the 2:15 mark - probably should have reached for the net  It was a decent fish.Nothing overly big that day but always fun when you get them - or miss them - on top.  Already looking forward to next season...at least for the topwater aspect.  Brian - I was determined to get that fish at 3:34, lol! Besides, I had a boat full of spectators passing by  Good Fishing,  Justin"
