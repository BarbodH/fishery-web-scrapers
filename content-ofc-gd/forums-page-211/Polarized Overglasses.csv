874073,floater,2014-09-25 20:52:00,220,Can anyone recommend a good pair of Polarized glasses you can wear over your regular glasses? I'm in the GTA but willing to travel to get a decent set for the boat. Thanks
874075,NANUK,2014-09-25 21:14:00,797,"Cocoons are good polarized fit overs , LeBarons have the Cocoons and a cheaper brand ( I don't remember the name ) You can get polarized fit overs at shoppers, Costco and most eye glass places."
874094,floater,2014-09-25 22:39:00,220,Good stuff. Heading to Lebarons sat I will check them out. THanks
874097,John Bacon,2014-09-25 23:43:00,3277,Another option is to order your prescription glasses with a clip on lense.
874101,vance,2014-09-26 00:26:00,719,Clip on polarized lenses are a good option but they don't provide the protection that overs do.The trouble with overs is finding ones that actually fit especially if your glasses are wide. The best for your buck are the ones that I always buy at the fishing show for $20.  vance
874102,bassjnkie,2014-09-26 00:35:00,1101,"I bought a polarized fit overs from Walmart Optical for I think $40.. They worked great for many year, just recently purchased polarized prescriptions which is a big weight difference...."
874105,vance,2014-09-26 00:45:00,719,BUT if you have bifocals they can't be polarized unfortunately...   vance
874115,Ice Fishing Ham,2014-09-26 08:48:00,83,"Check out Shoppers Drug Mart, I got my last pair there."
874116,fishindevil,2014-09-26 09:50:00,6254,I have about 6 pairs ISO !! Everything from $25 amber strike kings to $250 Maui Jim's !!! Which by the way are the best glasses I have ever used  I always have different color lenses and still find amber to be my fav color for most fishing conditions !!! There are many brands and styles & prices for sure try to get a pair that has sides or a arm that covers the side of the glasses so you don't get glare Comming on from the side !!! Make sure they are UVA & B as it's your eyes and the more protection the better
874119,floater,2014-09-26 10:06:00,220,I Have a few pairs of those clip ons from Shoppers for driving and I find they are weak in bright sun. I'm going to try out a pair of those Cocoons in Amber. Thanks guys
874121,NANUK,2014-09-26 10:25:00,797,"BTW, Cocoons come in 3 sizes, S M L to fit over many style of eyeglass frames, properly fitted they provide good coverage from all sides."
874122,dave524,2014-09-26 10:41:00,4508,"I've been wearing Bifocals for the last 15 years, I've always found the EasyClip Brand of glasses to meet my needs for a polarized glass. They are very light weight and fit so close that it is not obvious that you even are wearing clipons. They attach by magnets.  This site shows good photos of the brand.  http://www.perfect-eyeglasses-guide.com/easyclip-eyeglasses.html"
874137,glenner,2014-09-26 12:37:00,56,"I wear progressive bi-focals and had my prescription put on a pair of Ray Bans a few years ago and just recently did the same thing with a pair of Oakleys - both polarized - and they work great, no issues."
874146,Propwash,2014-09-26 13:28:00,19,"Before I had laser eye corrective surgery (best thing ever), I used cocoons in amber over my glasses.  They work real well and block out the light coming in from the sides.  I have a pair of aviator rayban-P's now, still in amber.  All around the best tint IMO"
874155,Beans,2014-09-26 15:29:00,3339,"I have a pair of ""Fitovers"" that I purchased from Marks Bait Shop a few years ago and they work well...The only problem is that they dig in too tightly behind my ears unless I wear them with a baseball type cap...  I also have a pair of prescription sunglasses but was told the could not be made in bifocals back when I bought them..."
874175,Ralph Field,2014-09-26 16:58:00,1018,"The ""fitsover"" are Australian made and come in different widths. They run around 50 dollars."
875323,dave1965,2014-10-04 12:35:00,41,"I used to buy them at Walmart but when I bought a pair at Costco I've never used any other, They are that good. You have to go to the optical department. They are about $35 plus tax.and work great for fishing, golf, and driving."
875324,floater,2014-10-04 12:52:00,220,DR.Dave what brand is it you get from Costco? I'm gonna head there on monday. THanks for all the tips guys.
875707,canliq,2014-10-07 12:57:00,24,"go to Maui Jims, They have over your glasses and the best polarized glasses I ever have."
