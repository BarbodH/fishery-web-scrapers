875218,jimmer,2014-10-03 15:11:00,2730,This was a surprise last minute catch. Amazing what will hit a muskie bait trolled at a higher speed. 
875220,Lunkerhunter,2014-10-03 15:13:00,455,always nice when the birthday guy gets a catch. thanks for sharing jim.  cheers
875223,mistaredone,2014-10-03 15:32:00,913,I never mind getting skunked if I can put a buddy on a fish. A nice bday present
875224,AKRISONER,2014-10-03 15:38:00,5558,"ive always said, that a fish in the boat is the boat's fish. Its a team effort out there.  Well done."
875225,Rich Clemens,2014-10-03 15:39:00,3131,"Interesting.  Last year I had a 20"" LargeMouth hit my Double-Cow girl on Nippissing. Nice to see some folks are catching some ski's this year."

875237,Gregoire,2014-10-03 16:40:00,1397,That looks like a Musky...they must be related.

875241,misfish,2014-10-03 17:07:00,29133,Thats why I fish bass. LOL  Nice bonus for his BDay.
875309,Wagoneer,2014-10-04 03:14:00,118,"I've had two PB's of other species (LM and SM bass) while trolling for muskie this year. Can't say I've been very successful for muskie, just a couple small ones, but it's crazy that bass will still hit a 8"" lure being trolled along at 6mph!"
875622,jimmer,2014-10-06 17:33:00,2730,That looks like a Musky...they must be related. It is but we always dream of multiple fish days.
