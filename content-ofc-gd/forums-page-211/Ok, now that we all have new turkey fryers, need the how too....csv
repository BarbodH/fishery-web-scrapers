Take note of level of liquids for oil level, remove bird, clean pot.  Prep bird by cutting off wing tips, pokes nose (sp?), extra neck fat.....it all just burns. You will now see where the brine has pooled under the skin, poke holes to let let it drain. This is where oil would pool after bird is done, so helps with that.  Dry bird thoroughly, place on stand legs up, tie up legs, cut and fold wings back on themselves. Use hook and broomstick with two people to SLOWLY lower in bird. Have oil just shy of 400f, turn off flame before lowering safely, the fire it up again. Get temp to about 350f, 3.5-4 mins a pound. Take temp, when breast hits 165ish, 175ish on legs, pull it out.

873381,Canuck2fan,2014-09-21 00:08:00,1444,"When you have used your oil a couple times and it is about at the end of it's life.... You can get extra value out of it by doing a couple of things you wouldn't want to do when it was fresh.  If you like farmer sausages for breakfast buy 20 lbs or so and simmer them in water in the small pot until cooked. Then heat the oil and BROWN them in the deep fryer for a few minutes. Freeze them on apart on cookie sheets and then bag them in meal sized lots. Reheat the sausages in the microwave on lower power for few minutes on a paper towels. Once you get the microwaving part down you can have eggs and farmer sausage for breakfast in about 5 minutes.  Another thing to cook off in large quantities at the end of the oils life are meatballs. THERE is NO better way to get a perfectly browned, not dried out meatball than in a deep fryer. Use your own recipe or buy frozen uncooked one and once they are cooked again freeze them on cookies sheets covered with waxed paper. Once frozen put them in meal sized packages.  One thing that goes GREAT with deep fried turkey or fish are buttermilk onion rings..... Cut a large onion into 3/8"" slices break apart and soak in buttermilk overnight in the fridge.  In a large ziplock mix 2 cups all purpose flour 2/3 corn starch 1 TBSP Lawrys seasoning salt  Drain the buttermilk from the onions. Toss the onion rings in the flour mixture in small batches and separate them on a cookie sheet place them in the fridge for 10 minutes to set the coating. Then deep fry until golden. They will only have a thin coating but people will gorge on them.  You can use the exact same recipe for fried chicken just add more of your favourite seasonings to the mix. If you like spicy food instead of buttermilk, coat the chicken with Franks red hot sauce instead but do not leave in the hot sauce for more than 5 to 10 minutes. If using wings cook at 350 F if using bigger pieces then cook at a lower temperature around 330 to 340F, so it will cook the chicken before it gets too dark.. Make sure though to thoroughly coat each piece of chicken with the flour mixture by reaching in and gently squeezing the flour mixture onto each one. Again for best results after coating lay out apart on a sheet and set the coating by refrigerating for 10 minutes to 1/2 an hour before frying.  If you have fish n chips made in the fryer you have to have deep fried mars bars/snickers or turtles afterward at least once.  Chill your chocolate bars or turtles in the fridge. I like to use bite sized bars myself. I developed a chocolate batter because the standard fish batter most people tend to use is just wrong LOL.  Chocolate Batter Ingredients:12 Fun Size Mars or Snicker Bars cook better than full sized ones IMO 1 cup plain flour1/2 cup corn starchA pinch of baking soda2 Tablespoons Sugar Dark Chocolate MilkOil for deep frying Directions: Chill the chocolate bar by keeping it in the fridge, but don't freeze it.Mix the flour, corn starch and bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) together.Add Dark Chocolate milk mixing until you get a batter with the consistency of Heavy creamDo NOT make the batter too thin.Heat the Fryer until the light shuts off or set at 350 F if you have temp controlRemove wrapper from chilled chocolate bar. Coat them with all purpose flour to help the batter stick Then dip completely in batter use a chocolate dipping fork if you have one Carefully lower into hot oil and fry until golden brown. Serve, with ice cream and caramel sauce, if you're so inclined.  Last item to try are homemade panzerottis. Find a bakery that will sell you wholewheat pizza dough for a really amazing result. I used to buy 24oz frozen wholewheat pizza dough from Buns Master. Do up and fry off a few dozen then freeze them. You won't waste your time buying hot pockets ever again."

A lot of people in the south though share the cost of the oil and propane by having 3 or 4 families do their turkeys one after another.... Makes is a lot more economical."
