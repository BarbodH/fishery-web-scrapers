875742,solopaddler,2014-10-07 17:26:00,8605,Thanks for the plug Chris. As far as you not being a steelheader we'll have to change that this fall.  Now that I have some time I'm going to start writing something on our trip north of Armstrong last month. I think I have 500 photos and about an hour and a half of video to sift through. Should be epic. For those that don't know we fished Whitewater Lake on the Ogoki River system and had one hell of a trip. Lots of walleye and some truly goliath pike.
875776,Rod Caster,2014-10-07 21:07:00,5784,I just checked in on your website the other day. Looking forward to reading the new piece and anything about yours/chris' recent trip

875868,Beavertail,2014-10-08 12:03:00,331,"Yeah, it was a good read. Wish it was around when I first started steelhead fishing, probably would have saved me a lot of fruitless time on the water! I gotta say, I'm still fairly new to the forum here, and I'm continually blown away by the amount of knowledge and experience shared by the members....it's pretty amazing."
