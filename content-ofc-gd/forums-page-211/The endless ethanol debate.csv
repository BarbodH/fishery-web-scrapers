That makes sense Raf,thanks for the info."

874676,spincast,2014-09-30 10:07:00,3279,"I didn't want to hijack the seafoam debate; reading it got me going on researching the ethanol question, With a new boat and 2 new motors and my first winter coming up, the interest was somewhat heightened compared to previous years/ A couple of interesting reads I came across:  from Evinrude: http://www.evinrude-parts.com/boat_ethanol_danger_precaution.html  A 2011 article with some very interesting quotes from Mercury http://www.boatus.com/magazine/2011/december/ethanol.asp  one from a guy who has way more time after every outing than I do, but who knows his way around a motor way better than me: http://www.injectorrenew.com/The_Facts.html (note - a lot of what is here is the same as in the Evinrude article)  and those led me to start investigating the concept of a water test kit, which led me to the statement below, which is very interesting. Of course this raises the question - if the ethanol absorbs the water, would the response of the food colouring be as described, or did this individual make a wrong turn at Albuquerque when going down the  deduction highway?  (this guy is into airplanes BTW)   While driving 20 miles into Mississippi to get ethanol-free gasoline for my airplane I was contemplating what must be in the blue dye that is in the Quick Check Solution kit. It occurred to me that what ever it was had to be water soluble so it would mix with the ethanol.  I always check the suppliers of ethanol-free fuel before pumping any gas as I have been lied to about it. Anyway, the test kit that you add water to is a hassle and takes a few minutes to settle out. The blue Fuel-Check works great but is expensive. When I got home I got my wife’s red, blue and green food coloring out; it’s water soluble. A quick check with pint jars of ethanol-free fuel and adulterated fuel indicated that a drop of any color food coloring will dissolve and turn the adulterated fuel the same color as the food coloring.  Putting a drop of food coloring in pure gasoline, the drop just goes to the bottom of the sample and rolls around there as little globules. Now I just carry a bottle of inexpensive and readily obtainable food coloring and a quart glass jar – it’s easier to get a fuel sample into – and have an instant indication of ethanol free fuel or adulterated fuel.  and Shell claims that the V-Power in Canada contains no Ethanol? I didn't think that was universal? Be interesting to confirm if the above article works. BTW - more than one of the reads indicated some  gas stations ( qualifier: these articles were all written in the US ) have been found to add additional ethanol to improve their profitability, some to levels that were causing serious damage to motors.  I'd be interested to hear everyone's experiences, and comments from our mechanic / DIY  members on these statements "
874680,Wagoneer,2014-09-30 10:40:00,118,"I've heard the same rumours about shell V-power but I can't see how that is possible. Maybe a couple years ago it was true, but the even the v-power now has the label ""may contain up to 10% ethanol"". Usually the higher octanes actually contain more ethanol than the lower octanes. Just a cheap way to raise the octane rating.  But the sad fact is that we live in Canada. Our gasoline standards are lower than third world countries. All of our gas, including diesel (ESPECIALLY our diesel) is crap.  BTW, that guys theory doesn't make any sense. He's been sniffing more aviation fuel than what makes it into his planes."

874750,cram,2014-09-30 18:27:00,1733,"Irishfield described a good/simple test on this site somewhere.   I think it was something like....put a bit of water in a mason jar,  mark the level of the water, fill the rest of the jar with gas, shake it up.  If the water/gas separation is higher than the original line, you have ethanol in the gas (which mixed with the water, increasing it's volume).  If not, you have pure gas. Or something like that. Maybe he can chime in."

Guess it's not the same thing, but thought I remembered him describing that test on here somewhere.  Or I just have a creative memory.  Either way, the test works on the same concept.  Water absorbs the ethanol (or visa versa), and the separation line will change if there's any in the gas.  You can buy kits that measure the % of ethanol by how much the level changes."

874762,irishfield,2014-09-30 19:50:00,26272,"Figured no point discrediting Rick's finding on the internet of using food colouring, without just testing it myself. Easy enough to do, but I did have to get out of my arm chair. I'd just bought 2 cans of cheap CTC regular this morning and had some Shell V power premium in the hangar already.  Took 2 clear mason jars 1/2 full of each fuel and just added a few drops of food colouring... and both did the same. The colouring went through the fuel and beaded at the bottom. Not what I expected, I had faith in the regular turning blue.  SO.. I grabbed another jar, put some water in it... marked my line and then added the regular fuel. And low and behold, our CTC regular has no ethanol in it!!!!  So if someone has a known source for thinned out gasoline, do us all a favour and try the food colouring in it and see what happens. Real science will put this to rest...  BTW... food colouring drops right through the 100% gas and then turns the water to blue! Imagine it will turn ethanol laden fuel blue as well, but that remains speculation at this point!"

Way back, I had a 1996 Cavalier that had that notorious chevy shake in the motor when idling. I called a bud who`s a GM mechanic to ask. He advised me to use premium gas and synthetic engine oil. By the second oil change she smoothed right out. Been using premium and synthetic in everything I own since.  Oh BTW...the Husky I stopped at the other day has ethanol in their premium as well. Drove to the nearest Shell instead."
875102,irishfield,2014-10-02 15:46:00,26272,500 to 400 makes a lot of sense Newf... as 15 % ethanol in gasoline brings it's BTU's (energy content) down to about 80% of straight gas. Less BTU's per litre and you need to use more fuel to go the same speed.
875117,Sinker,2014-10-02 17:59:00,8692,"I'm lucky to have gas stations with NO ethanol in any of the fuel where I live. There are 3 or 4 stations with NO ethanol.  Before that, I was running Shell V-power in everything.  I find a big difference in mileage with no ethanol fuel, similar to PURENEWF. I get an additional 100+km per tank with NO ethanol regular fuel.  S."
