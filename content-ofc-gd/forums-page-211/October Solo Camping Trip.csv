875989,Tim Mills,2014-10-09 03:28:00,476,"I went camping a little east of Bon Echo PP last weekend.  I knew the weather wasn't going to be ideal but I was running out of weekends so the dog and I went anyway.  There was only 1 other site occupied that weekend.  Our campsite for a couple of nights.  The lake is drained for hydro in the fall so summer water levels are down 6-8ft      Sandy Beach and good wind protection for the boat    The fishing was decent but not as good as last fall. More pike, smaller bass and no walleye.      My best pike, jigging a white grub      Steady rain Friday night until Saturday noon but we stayed dry.    I was hoping for better fishing but the beer was cold, the food was good, and the camping was free.      The dog roughing it    Some Bear tracks in the creek bank behind the campsite.      "

875994,Rod Caster,2014-10-09 07:08:00,5784,Breakfast of champions!!  That is the kind of trip that eases the mind and soul.

876000,solopaddler,2014-10-09 11:04:00,8605,"Man, I wish my gsp would be so laid back in a boat, she's like a tasmanian devil LOL! Looks like a great time!"
876011,Jer,2014-10-09 11:59:00,1426,I think we've camped that exact site. Crotch Lake #8? Love it there.
876012,glenner,2014-10-09 11:59:00,56,"Classic picture of your dog relaxing in the boat. My Lab does the same, gets in and goes right to sleep, doesn't even get interested when I bring a fish into the boat. Some great pictures and looks like a beautiful spot, great solitude."
876023,Steelheadphycho,2014-10-09 13:13:00,470,"Absolute perfection.  That's exactly how I'd do it. Although, I don't think I could without my son.  Thanks for sharing!"

876035,bare foot wader,2014-10-09 14:30:00,1354,"looks a great time...rain or shine my lab will lean lurched over the gunnels, intently focused on my casting, doesn't matter 4 hours or 12 hours, doesn't take too many breaks...I feel so bad not catching anything and he gives me that ""look""...definitely why do you suck so much type of look"
876042,Joeytier,2014-10-09 16:06:00,3990,The pics of the pup are hilarious.  I grew up fishing and camping on that lake.  Very pretty spot

I know what you mean Mike, he is 10 and really calmed down after when he turned 9, he used to be crazy but for some reason has always been good in the canoe and boat.  These trips take alot out of him though, its about a 2 day recovery."
876051,Tim Mills,2014-10-09 16:56:00,476,"The pics of the pup are hilarious. I grew up fishing and camping on that lake. Very pretty spot Joey- if you know the breed, you know they are eccentric.  The dog is under the table for 2 reasons, he wants to stay dry but he is also biting at rain drops as they fall off the table.  It is a nice spot for 4 hours away, but I was told that there will be changes due to the recent land claims.  I was told by a cottager that one side of the South Access road and Big Island were going to be lost to the land claim."
876053,Terry,2014-10-09 17:09:00,14456,looks like a great trip
