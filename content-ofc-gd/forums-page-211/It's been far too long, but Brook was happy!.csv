We all went fishing this past Sunday (along with daughter's boyfriend) in my boat which has been dry docked for 3 and a half years (sadly).  Fishing was slow but the weather was beauty. Daughter out fished both her Dad and boyfriend, nothing earth shattering in size or numbers but it didn't have to be, it was the ""just being out there"" kind of day for all of us.  I'm sure I'll get more pics in my email but for now all I have this.    "

874650,MJL,2014-09-30 00:28:00,2427,I'm pretty sure I still have some of Brook's hair on my fleece jacket from the last time we fished together.LOL  I also have nightmares of sharing the same room with Cliff and having a black lab licking my feet at 2am in the morning.  Great to see you finally got out
874962,motv8tr,2014-10-01 19:26:00,2587,"Glad to hear both you and the boat, along with Brook, and your daughter of course, sounds like it's been way too long.  No surprise the girl out fished the boys though  Maureen"

Your girl has a good eye.  How's that mobile 5 star hotel working out? All the comforts of home, just don't crawl in the back for a nap and put her in cruise control."
