875564,Moosebunk,2014-10-06 02:25:00,3970,"Jeez fellers, that's a fun days jiggin' right there.  Nice chunker too Doug!"
875984,Tim Mills,2014-10-09 02:29:00,476,"Awesome Report Bill, very inspiring results, I hope to give that a try in early Dec."
876004,BillM,2014-10-09 11:28:00,17367,"Awesome Report Bill, very inspiring results, I hope to give that a try in early Dec.  Thanks man, we had a riot out there.   Next time I'll be fishing these things is through the ice!  Hopefully I'll be fishing the exact same spots"
874223,BillM,2014-09-27 01:50:00,17367,"Couldn't ignore the weatherman...  Stable weather for the past few days, a season about to close and one of my fav fish to chase.   Hit the water in a thick thick fog, got worse the closer we got to our destination.    I don't like riding the GPS but you couldn't see 50yrds in front of the boat this morning. So the nav lights were turned on and we made out way out to spot #1 at a slower than normal pace.  Immediately the the graph was lit up, fish all over the place.   Found a nice hump out of deep water, my buddy Doug dropped down and a few mins later I was greeted with this.    First fish of the day was a fat chunky laker.    After that it was non-stop.....We were out there laughing like schoolgirls.   Doug would get one on I'd scream out ITS TIME FOR DOUBLE DOUBLE! and WHAM! Fish on!   I can't count the number of double headers we had, 8?  9?  I dunno..   I also don't want to count the number of fish we missed, lol.   The nice thing was the average size, a good 6-8lbs with a few teeners thrown in and a few TANKS!!!        Doug with a cow!      I got into the action myself (After losing I think my first 4 fish?  Swapped that hook out with the quickness!)    Huge guts on some of these fish.  The runs they were making were crazy... We'd get them up to the boat and back down they'd go..  This would happen 3-4 times...  Reels were screaming today!          Bluebird skies?  Didn't matter the big ones kept on coming.      What a day, some of the best laker fishing I've had since the spring on the southern shore of Lake O.   I think my buddy Doug upped his PB a few times today...   We didn't take any measurements but a few were pushing the 20lb mark some them were so thick across the back.  , all on 7.5ft ML spinning setups, 1000 series reels with 6lb braid, no need for the meat sticks!   Some of the runs these fish made were just insane, super hard hits and just screaming.. We had to chase two of them with the trolling motor because they just weren't stopping."
874224,misfish,2014-09-27 02:00:00,29133,Nice.  Looks like Skud has shed a few pounds. We could pass as twins.LOL  NICE FISH GUYS
874226,msp,2014-09-27 02:09:00,1336,"wicked dude ! i just took 3 days off chasing my favorites too, with great results. Gotta love fall"
874228,creditmaster,2014-09-27 02:18:00,190,nice lakers man
874239,Skud,2014-09-27 03:11:00,739,"It was a fun day for sure! I think my best laker before today was 6lbs. Shattered that record by far with my biggest today. And yes, we were laughing like school girls. Thanks for the great day Bill."
874240,4x4bassin,2014-09-27 04:19:00,1025,"Looks like a great day guys , a couple tanks there for sure. Heading up to a Parry Sound area lake tomorrow for the last kick at the can laker hunting . Hopefully I will have as good luck as you ."
874246,fishindevil,2014-09-27 08:06:00,6254,Well done guys !!!! Some real nice greezers !!!! A few fat tanks !!!!! Looked like a stellar day !!!! Fish-on ......
874247,Terry,2014-09-27 09:25:00,14456,nice going
874248,davey buoy,2014-09-27 09:34:00,5505,"Now that's Laker fishing!!!!!!!!,WTG guys,great shots!!"
874250,spincast,2014-09-27 11:02:00,3279,"sweet! Those would be a riot on light tackle like that!  Curious as to your set-up? Not riggin', obviously. Do you run three way swivels or something else?"
874254,Rod Caster,2014-09-27 12:54:00,5784,"wow, that's quite the outing. Worth the stress of driving in the fog"
874255,Ralph Field,2014-09-27 13:00:00,1018,"Always good to spend time with a friend on the water, especially when the fish are cooperating."
874256,Walleye72,2014-09-27 13:14:00,156,"Wow!  Sounds like a great day on the water.  ""Right place, Right time"" as they say."
874257,RickOnt,2014-09-27 13:24:00,669,"Sweeeet!!  Fantastic day right there.  Jigging is by far my favorite way to get Lakers,  Well done"
874275,BillM,2014-09-27 18:24:00,17367,"sweet! Those would be a riot on light tackle like that!  Curious as to your set-up? Not riggin', obviously. Do you run three way swivels or something else?  Nope, nothing complicated.  Jigging spoons and jigheads with an assortment of different coloured swammers.  No live bait or anything like that.  These fish weren't picky."
874280,spincast,2014-09-27 19:11:00,3279,awesome. one of these days I'm gonna have to try that. I'v never tried jigging that deep - the hit must be a rush and a half
874292,BillM,2014-09-27 21:51:00,17367,"awesome. one of these days I'm gonna have to try that. I'v never tried jigging that deep - the hit must be a rush and a half  Some of them were small 'ticks' as you let the spoon/whatever back down.  Some were downright crazy, super hard hits then 100yrds of line gone from the reel in seconds    Half of these fish had no idea they were hooked until they got to the surface, then all hell broke loose."
874295,Joeytier,2014-09-27 22:32:00,3990,"Wow, that is a nutso laker slay.  I've never really deviated from trolling for greys, but that looks fantastic"
874296,xxgoaler,2014-09-27 22:34:00,106,"Beauty fish, heading out in the morning, hope we have half the fun you guy's did"
874534,AKRISONER,2014-09-29 15:51:00,5558,"so encouraging for me, yet so depressing i missed the opportunity for a day on the bay with the bite on.  Till next season!"
874567,MJL,2014-09-29 18:14:00,2427,The last few days I've been dreaming of sonar screens and 'chases'.LOL  Nicely done Bill
874623,solopaddler,2014-09-29 21:50:00,8605,Way to go boys!!
874827,Rustic-Fisher,2014-09-30 23:36:00,826,"Nice, you caught more lakers in a day then I've caught all year !!! R"
874896,adolson,2014-10-01 14:54:00,783,"Nice, you caught more lakers in a day then I've caught all year !!! R And than I've caught all my life! (My count is at a measly 5 right now...)."
