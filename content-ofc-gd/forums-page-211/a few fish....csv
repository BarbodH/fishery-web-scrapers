875643,spincast,2014-10-06 21:54:00,3279,"kinda wondered where you wandered off to, or was that floated? Last time you stopped by things were looking a little wet that way if I remember correclty? Glad to see the fish all came back to play.  As Rodcaster said - that is one tank of a walley."

The high water also brought in perch and crappie. That walleye my son is holding is not as big as it seems. He was helping release tourny fish. That wasnt our catch, it was our cousins. If i remember correctly it was 8.41 lbs. Still a beauty though"
