875259,jedimaster,2014-10-03 20:29:00,3472,"Just thought I would drop in here and see if anyone else partakes in woodworking. Drop your photos, it may give others some ideas of what project to tackle next.  Here is a set of Muskoka chairs I built a few weeks ago. Hopefully will get around to make the matching foot stool and side table. Western Red Cedar, used some pictures and plans but ended up with a bunch of changes. I used 5/4 x6 for all the structural pieces as well as 1x2 for the slats  I guess I should add a few in between steps.  I was originally told Muskoka chairs aren't comfortable so I told her to come down and help me make a custome template for seating portion...   Some of the pieces cut and awaiting ASSembly.    All done and ready for treating...  [/url]   The happy I finished it shot...     A shot of our picnic table out back. This is 2x6 for the table top, 2x4's for the rest. The legs are 4x4's all made from western red cedar.  A better shot of the table..   "

875265,Big Cliff,2014-10-03 21:10:00,6899,That is some beautiful work there! Wood looks good too!
875266,jedimaster,2014-10-03 21:27:00,3472,umm.. Thanks Cliff.
875268,Ainsley,2014-10-03 21:34:00,142,"Great looking pieces.  I'm in the process of turning my garage into a shop. I do a mix of metal and woodworking, I even make my own knives."
875269,jedimaster,2014-10-03 21:38:00,3472,Nice I have often wanted to make some knives. Keep us updated on how it goes. I have really enjoyed having the radial arm saw. I got a great deal on one in pristine condition. Makes doing repeated cuts a breeze. They do have there dangers though as far as tools go. I much prefer it over my compound mitre.
875272,Ainsley,2014-10-03 21:49:00,142,"My dad has always been a radial arm saw kinda guy, they're great for wide cross cuts! If I had room in my shop I'd probably get one but I get by with my makita mitre saw and rigid tablesaw with a cross cut sled."

875276,captpierre,2014-10-03 22:00:00,2521,bought a couple precut/ready to assemble Muskoka chaires at Costco.  $50  nice but they are pine.  would have preferred cedar like yours
875277,Spiel,2014-10-03 22:01:00,9065,"I love wood working. However I'm not doing anything as large as your work JM which looks amazing. Love the Muskoka chair.  I hope you and the family are well and settled in after that long journey (I was horribly remiss in replying to the great post detailing the journey, it was awesome! My bad!).  I'll share a few wood working pictures though that are of a much smaller scale.                  "
875281,2 tone z71,2014-10-03 22:20:00,1311,Beautiful.. nothing like taking pride in your craftsmanship ..Spiel gonna message ya on a rod... info
875283,jedimaster,2014-10-03 22:38:00,3472,Thanks Spiel and awesome work on the rods and the knives as well. I have wanted to get into some smaller more fine detail for a long time.
875414,John Bacon,2014-10-05 01:48:00,3277,When I saw the heading I thought you wanted to form a union.  Nice work on the furniture.  Those benches look good and stable.
875493,aplumma,2014-10-05 21:28:00,6896,Nice wood work for sure. If you feel like doing knifes give me a holler I have a few sources here in the States that might be of help. The first photo you posted I thought you were making a coffin lol.      
875495,aplumma,2014-10-05 21:32:00,6896,I figured I would also post this picture of the bench and table my Pops built. He is a wood working genius. for sure.         Art
875515,Rod Caster,2014-10-05 23:09:00,5784,Looks great guys. I have neither the patience or the skills to do nice work like that. I can cut a tree and chop up the wood though haha.  I have an unlimited supply of yellow birch burl if anyone is interested. Some of them are massive.

875580,Ainsley,2014-10-06 12:18:00,142,"Aplumma, I really like the santoku and pairing knives. Do you do your own heat treat?  Here is an assembly picture of one of the three racks I made to hold plano 3700 series trays, I don't have any finished pictures right now.  Two were made to hold fasteners in my dad's and my shop and one is to hold my tackle.  Here are a couple more projects, I don't really build furniture, more just random ideas and projects.  Wine barrel coat racks, I sold all but two of these of 10:  Mounting pieces made of Ipe (to match the existing teak) for my boat, I also made the trip from Ipe "

875641,fishindevil,2014-10-06 21:47:00,6254,Wow !!!! Some awesome work there everyone !!! Quite a talented bunch here on ofc !!!! Cheers
875654,aplumma,2014-10-06 22:54:00,6896,"Aplumma, I really like the santoku and pairing knives. Do you do your own heat treat?  I have found that the cost of the kiln and the other pieces of equipment to expensive to buy for just a hobby. I already have a Tig , Mig, plasmacutter, powder coating and Sandblasting booth for restoring motorcycles and cars as a hobby.  I invested in an expensive knife sharpening set up and fund it with some custom knifes and a few chefs send me their knife rolls to repair there  handles and regrind their edges. Most of my materials come from this site   http://www.knifemaking.com/default.asp. they can get the full spectrum of blades from blanks to finished edges. The pairing knifes are actually a pretty high end blank they were made for a client who had them forged  in Japan in the damascus style using a blue steel core and 128 fold overlay ( R 65).   Art"
