875389,misfish,2014-10-04 22:22:00,29133,"Heading out this morning,I had notice I had used a  quarter tank since tuesday. Since I was getting a coffee and the station was there as well,I decided to fill up the top end of the tank just to see. It cost 33 bux to top it out. I fill to the brim. So full tank to start,I,m now at 235 km. 30 km at pick up,so I have driven 205 km. Is my math off? It works out to me as 7 lt per 100 km. Correct me if Im wrong."
875390,BillM,2014-10-04 22:25:00,17367,"How many litres did you put in?  The best way to do this is to fill the tank, run it until the low fuel light comes on, fill it back up, record how many litres then do the math."
875392,misfish,2014-10-04 22:37:00,29133,I paid 1.22 a lt Bill.

875460,Woodsman,2014-10-05 16:05:00,1286,"At around 10,000 km the milage on my 3.6 showed an improvment of 1-2 litres per 100 km."
875463,Old Ironmaker,2014-10-05 16:36:00,8243,"I just took a run to Nipissing towing my 19 footer with a 115 and kicker on it and got a respectable 14.5L/100K,2011 V8/4X4 Silverado. I didn't do over 110 KPH, no start and stop on any highway and always run with the towing mode on, always. I can't complain with that at all. When you do the math an extra liter per 100 KMS is about $1.40 per 62 miles. Pennies per mile, but it adds up.  I always put in the high test when pulling the boat for a longer distance. I will put in the good stuff every 3rd fill up as I do very little if any driving over 90 KMH, the entire county doesn't have a 100 KPH highway. I don't know if it matters but I feel it can't hurt, can it?."
875475,danbouck,2014-10-05 19:23:00,4380,"Nice truck, you're gonna love it! I just hit 10k on my 14 crew 4x4 with the 3.6. Averaging 10.5L/100km right now and it goes down to 8.5 on the highway.  The price between the HEMI and v6 changes from trim level to trim level. HEMI was an upgrade in the SLT trim.  Mine sure makes closing the cottage easier  "

875112,Fisherman,2014-10-02 16:44:00,7201,Last I just heard they can't keep the Ecodiesels on the lot and can barely keep up with orders.  Looks like they will double the line to accomodate the demand.

And the feeling of a brand new out of the package new anything, but a truck, even better new. I never bought a new vehicle and I have been killing vehicles for 44 years. My wife(s) had new cars but I never did. After getting some very bad health news my lady was driving us home and we were on Upper James in Hamilton, dealers alley. She pulled into the John Bear GM dealer and told me, "" you my dear are getting a new truck "". I did and I love her, my wife too.  I got a 2011 in November of 2011 and I wasn't even thinking about a new truck that winter, my 90 GMC 4X$ short box stepside was fine for another winter. But with the incentives I got a full size Silverado 4X4 crew cab with the chrome package and bigger V8 for more than 10K off the window sticker price.  The price that Ford and Dodge wanted for the similar models was 8K to 15K more. If anyone is thinking about next year for new wheels shop now, you won't be ordering options and section is limited but the prices can't be beat in the fall.  Again, nice ride, love the Black on Black."
875200,Steelheadphycho,2014-10-03 12:41:00,470,"Nice rig! My brother has a 1998 F-150 with the 3.9L V6 that still to this day has sufficient ""stugatz"" to pull his boat full of gear and haul 4 obese dudes 12 hrs north. Always gotten great mileage and totally dependable. No 4 wheel drive or power anything. Just keep a good wax on it. His black on black looks real old (cuz it is!) Congrats man!"
875222,canliq,2014-10-03 15:30:00,24,Congratulation Brian for your new ride. Now you can put your toon in the trunk without need to deflate. Also you can carry a kayak with that truck..

874763,misfish,2014-09-30 19:57:00,29133,"The Avenger mopar powered sweet ride was real nice,but she was holding me back. I had a heart to heart with her and said girl,your so fine. Your lines are so slim and sleek. You make me look soooo fly for an old guy. BUT,BUT You need to look for someone younger then I. We said our sad good byes,a tear or two was shed. I watched her slowly roll away,  When she was out of sight,I did the happy dance and said HELLLLOOOOOOO NEW GIRL    She will fill that void I,m sure. I,m so sure,as I forgot all about the other girl as soon as I pulled out of the parking lot. HA HA HA    My new 2014 Ram 1500. 3.6/ V6. Black on Black         Here,s the kicker. All this talk about trucks are gas guzzlers. This one like to sip. 8 speed transmission and the RPM,s never broke 1500 all the way home.  Starting point,401 and Dixie.  Set cruise 105.

Buyers price.  Davey. Black on black. Always loved it.  Bernie. Thanks. Just dont tell Joe. LOL  anders. I was a ford boy as well. But like you say,they just knock it out.  Hooked. Thanks. It drove smooth. When it the city here on bumpy roads,you know it,s a short box. But Im ok with that,  Ryan. I just got it. Give me atleast a day or two.  Joey. Yes, it is not 4x4. here was my thinking here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  I wanted a truck that had little to no extras that could go wrong. I tried to find something that was pretty much plane jane. Manual locks,manual windows. 4X4 was IMO just something else that could go wrong and could cost me later on after warranty. I also need something that would get me back to some back lakes that require some height clearance. Thats where the Avenger didnt help me.  With a change in my life style, I can now afford some extra cash to feed the fuel cell when need be for longer trips. I was also surprised that my insurance dropped 130 bucks. That,s another bonus in my favor.  Now for that other guy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   NO  NO  NO  BOAT IN MY FUTURE.  THE TOON SERVES ME WELL"

874883,Terry,2014-10-01 13:20:00,14456,I think the v6 is more then the basic hemi.  Basic hemi. 6 speed tranny.  V6. 8 speed. Tranny
