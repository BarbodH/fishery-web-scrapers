The thing is, there is no transducer on the back of the boat, it would appear as though they are through hull or something???  How would I go about using the same connectors if that is even possible..?If not, how in the heck can I run it through the hull like its equipped, as I dont want to drill into the transom??  Thank you very much, I know nothing about this stuff and have found this boating business to be a complete nightmare...."

You can also attach a piece of plastic  to your transom for mounting transducers too,( the name of the stuff escapes me at the moment, but it looks like the white plastic cutting boards. Just glue it on with 5200 or similar, then screw to that.)  or you can re-install a new thru hull for a new unit. Its not hard at all.  Sinker"
