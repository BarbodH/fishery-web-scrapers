I have heard that the forks of the credit can be productive for trout (brookies or rainbows don't remember which at the moment).  I know there are a few here that fish there, and there may be some special regs so make sure you check them out before you decide to go.  Good luck with it."

Check regs as they may be barbless hooks, no live bait, or fly fishing only. On hwy 24 (?) there is actually river access for fishermen on the south side, and a walk trail down to the river."
