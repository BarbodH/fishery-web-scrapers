I found that it went without any warning, wouldn't knot, and would crack off.... absolute poo! but I went back out and respooled my reels and it was the same again, starts off great for the first couple outings.. then goes down hill..  ..just baught some Triline 100% and will tell you how that goes..!  another idea.. check out ->  http://www.tackletour.com/menuarchive.html its a great place to get reviews on different line , reels , rods , luers .. etc !"
