Where are pike generally found this time of year?  I was planning on using some spinnerbaits and jerk baits....any other suggestions?  Thanks."
340323,bigpikemike,2009-05-11 16:43:00,52,right up on shore....find weeds and points....ambush spots for the pike....dont be afriad to cast into 1.5 fow to catch them....shallow bays and inlets as well
340324,rromberg,2009-05-11 16:50:00,10,"Pike usually stay shallow until the water warms. They can still be found close to their spawning grounds ( weedy bays). Check corners of bays, rocky points and along drops in the ten to twenty feet range. I find using lures like rapalas, ripplin redfins or other minnow baits work good in the spring. Fish them like a jerk bait. If the wind picks up try your spinners. Remember to use a wire leader or using lures can get pricy. One of the most productive ways to get spring pike is to fish a dead smelt or sucker under a bobber.  Hope that helps, good luck."

340598,splashhopper,2009-05-12 11:28:00,2931,"  Why so heavy test?  Is it to save the tackle I have been losing the past week ? Snag city !  Or, is it because of teeth on the fish ?  Thanks."
340632,sneak_e_pete,2009-05-12 13:03:00,540,Thanks for the info.  I appreciate it.  I'll let you know how I do.
