340005,BillM,2009-05-10 17:04:00,17367,"What is that thing, like 6lbs????  HUGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
340011,salmon,2009-05-10 17:33:00,334,Huge!!!!!  WTG
340031,Sandbag,2009-05-10 18:26:00,533,That is a fatty....nice job  Cheers  Craig
340037,Joeytier,2009-05-10 18:37:00,3990,"Wow, what a giant.  Was it bleeding from the gills or something?  Doesn't look too healthy."
340046,Big Cliff,2009-05-10 19:14:00,6899,A real beauty for sure! Fish isn't bad either.
340047,mj2112,2009-05-10 19:20:00,46,"That fish was bleeding from the lip, it was caught on a sonar (blade bait) and it must have cut it.  It was fine though, we release all of the fish and that 1 swam away to be caught again by someone else."
340050,Joey,2009-05-10 19:54:00,9122,What a monster.  Congrats to the GF.  Joey
340059,bigpikemike,2009-05-10 20:23:00,52,dont know what looks nicer this fish or the gf!
340166,rbaquial,2009-05-11 01:39:00,968,OMG! That's a BEAUT.... the fish isn't bad looking either! Seriously.... nice catch tho!  Congrats to the GF!
340192,SNAGKING,2009-05-11 02:24:00,43,Did you drop it between pictures? His tail got ruin in the 2nd pic.
340194,ciceri,2009-05-11 02:34:00,535," that's weird eh. Nice fish, but what happened to it's tail?"
340232,Musky or Specks,2009-05-11 11:19:00,2710,I would imagine the tail is beat up from the rigours of spawning. Nice pig
340245,mj2112,2009-05-11 12:21:00,46,"I don't know what happened to it, I had to look at it after you mentioned it because I didn't see that before.  I thought the tail was bent from the fish wiggling while she held it but it does look damaged. I am leaving her home next time."
340304,wallyboss,2009-05-11 15:39:00,1095,The tail??? Is it the same fish???? One picture the tail is fine and the next the tail is gone.  Don't tell me you got a piece of tail in the boat?
340375,fishermccann,2009-05-11 19:35:00,655,I thought thats why you take  them fishing!
340401,Beats,2009-05-11 20:47:00,543,  
340580,Fisherpete,2009-05-12 05:17:00,1814,"The tail is still there... have you ever watched a LM's or SM's tail while you are holding them by the lip? I don't know if this is the correct word, but often the tail 'undulates' as you hold them... looks almost like that breakdancing move called the worm... LOL even more confused now? And by the way WOW, nice fish! Here's a pic of a nice LM I caught 2 summers ago with his tail doing the worm LOL.  "
340615,mj2112,2009-05-12 12:12:00,46,Nice Largemouth! We caught a few of them but not that fat. That tail did not break off of that smallie cuz it would have been in my boat and that fish never hit the ground.
340828,Leecher,2009-05-12 23:26:00,7832,Great report and pics mj2112 That is the perfect gift for mothers day.... Congratulations to your GF for landing this beast Thanks for sharing Leechman
