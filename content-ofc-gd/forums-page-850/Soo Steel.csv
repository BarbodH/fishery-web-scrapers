340339,TDunn,2009-05-11 17:39:00,680,"This report actually will start from last thursday evening. I took a ride up highway 17 along the Lake Superiour shoreline to check out the river levels and brought my rod along to make a few casts. Water looked great and I hiked up a trail to a set of falls just off the side of the highway. Second cast and I hooked into a beauty female. I was flying solo so I took a few pics while releasing the fish.        As I was taking the photos these two meatheads showed up and immediatley started casting my pool after seeing me with the fish. They hooked two while I was releasing the hen but did not land them and completely spooked the hole which is really only big enough for one or maybe two guys...So I left feeling a bit annoyed and returned early the next morning with a bud for an hour and to my surprise never hit any fish at the falls. But.....I did land a small male in a tight run below the falls on a pink worm. Kept this fish because the hook was very deep......          Saturday I hit up my honey hole with my two cousins. It was a fantastic day and we actually found another new spot to fish......Basically untouched....We landed 3 fish,  2 of which were females and were not spawned out yet. Releaed all fish..... Oh, I hope you like the underwater footage. We hope to get more soon for you guys....This was the first time we got to use the camera.          Underwater Video of Release    And the pictures of the 3rd fish of the day is on my cousins camera so I do not have a pic of it....yet.. Also have video of its release....I may post it if he sends it to me soon....  Enjoy!  TDunn"

Woke up to a frigid -1 this morning and got out with my uncle for a few passes in the river for whatever would hit...... Pine St boat launch was closed so we had to launch in Garden River at Bens Baits and ran the river up from there. The fishing wasnt hot but we managed a few bites....  My first Atlantic of the year......Small guy.....    Few pics of the river.....       And then ended the morning with this tiny coho that was super chrome....    All fished released....   TDunn
