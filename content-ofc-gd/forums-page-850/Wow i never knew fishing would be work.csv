340541,Kenny G,2009-05-12 02:40:00,118,Backbreaking fishing I would think. Those fish are going nuts! Kenny G.
340544,Greencoachdog,2009-05-12 02:59:00,8163,You should come deep sea bottom fishing with me sometime 'enry... I'd like to see how much spunk you had left in you after pulling a 30lb. Grouper up out of 200 FOW!!!... and that's just the warm up!... Then we'll move to the Amberjack hole!!!  Did I mention the blistering sun???
