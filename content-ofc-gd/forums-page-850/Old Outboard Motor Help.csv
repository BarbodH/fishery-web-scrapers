The motor was given to me by my wife's uncle several years ago, and I finally pulled it out to try and get it running.  2 new spark plugs and it fired right up.  The question I have, is that it seems to smoke a lot, and I am not sure what is normal for a motor of that age.  I started it with water in a garbage can, and it spit water out fine.  I double checked that I had the correct fuel mixture and it was correct at 50:1.  The smoke was coming from the garbage pail.  At idle it was minimal, but when I gave it more gas, the smoke increased quite a bit.  I did change the lower unit oil before running it.  Is this normal for a motor of that age?  Any help is appreciated.  Thanks."
