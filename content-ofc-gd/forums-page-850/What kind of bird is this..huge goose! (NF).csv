340954,bigfish1965,2009-05-13 03:15:00,3382,I saw this bird tonite. It was huge. Almost swan sized...much bigger than a Canada Goose. The colours were exactly like a seagulls.. I looked through the Ducks Unlimited site and saw nothing close. Maybe some kind of hybrid?? 
340955,irishfield,2009-05-13 03:16:00,26272,Maybe you'd been drinkin Rick and it didnt' really look like that ! lol
340957,bigfish1965,2009-05-13 03:18:00,3382,Maybe..lol..but my camera was sober.
340958,Bondar,2009-05-13 03:19:00,817,LOL that goose is pretty famous i think i've seen his picture on every board around now haha   thats from queenston different bird but similar
340959,Mattitude,2009-05-13 03:21:00,155,Looks like a Snow Goose to me. http://www.alandsuejohnson.com/assateague%...s/scan0051.html
340960,irishfield,2009-05-13 03:22:00,26272, LOL.. looks like some version of a Snow Goose.
340961,bigfish1965,2009-05-13 03:24:00,3382,"Because of the different bill, I was thinking snow/domestic cross. There should be no snow geese here this time of year."
340962,Bondar,2009-05-13 03:24:00,817,i just figured it was some kind of farm escape artist
340964,dave524,2009-05-13 03:25:00,4508,"It is a domestic goose , looks like it has a lot of Greylag Goose in it, maybe something else, Heinz 57 of the goose world."
340965,kickingfrog,2009-05-13 03:26:00,8333,LOL! The add at the bottom of this page when I looked was something called Duck Duck date.

340972,Ron,2009-05-13 03:37:00,1683,Domestic Greylag Goose it is...  http://www.birds.cornell.edu/crows/domgeese.htm
340974,irishfield,2009-05-13 03:39:00,26272,So there ya go Rick.. you can kill it and eat it ! Cut your grocery bill now bud..
340975,bigugli,2009-05-13 03:39:00,6138,"Domestic and wild geese interbreed quite easily. Maybe a little Snow, a little Greylag, a little ?..."
340976,dave524,2009-05-13 03:40:00,4508,"These guys interbreed with a Canada's , we've got a couple down at the mouth of Forty Mile Creek, then things really get interesting hence my former Heinz 57 comment  http://www.flickr.com/groups/hybridbirds/d...57601783757808/"
340980,Greencoachdog,2009-05-13 03:47:00,8163,His/her name is BIG BIRD!!!   ... kin to MTP I think...
340984,smokin joe,2009-05-13 04:02:00,226,That one's the supper goose
340988,young_one,2009-05-13 04:13:00,620,"Grey Goose, hopefully the same kind they sell at LCBO (expensive vodka)"
340993,dave524,2009-05-13 04:41:00,4508,"  this is the greylag/canada cross from Forty Creek, he has been there a few years now, sired a few offspring I think"
340995,l2p,2009-05-13 05:08:00,346,"that thing has teeth!! saw a show on the dicovery channel about people altering fertilized chicken eggs by adding ""dinosour"" genes into the embreyo and they hatched a ""chicken"" with a long tail talons and teeth. kinda messed up in my opinion."
