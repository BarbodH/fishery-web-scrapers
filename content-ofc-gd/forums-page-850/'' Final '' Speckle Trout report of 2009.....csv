340498,Fishing 24/7,2009-05-12 01:05:00,709,.......  i have to say ...  those nature shots are getting to me....  that loon landing on its belly ir a real nice shot....  and the speck on the flotting log.... outstanding work.  yeah i was sick as a dog / and or hog .  but he dragged me up to the lake ...  and then the adrenaline kicked in when i hit the first speck. a nice 1 lbs .  ate that one like there was no tommorow.  that fresh fish gave me the strengh of 10 men and then i hit that beauty.  the colors are this one was OUTSTANDING!  a true quebec red... the type i was looking for.  3.4 lbs on the scale. thats my trout of 2009 right there.    i still cant believe some people claim that this lake is stocked.   LOOK AT IT! HOW CAN IT BE!       i spraise this lake and all the great fortune it brought us!
