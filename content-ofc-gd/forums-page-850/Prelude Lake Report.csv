All this sun and warmth is taking it's toll on our ice....................yeah, yeah, I know Boo Hoo!!!! Yesterday was my last day to drive my truck on the lake this winter as the landings are getting sketchy.  :'( Now I'm going to have to haul my gear on foot, DOH!!!!!  Here's the approach to the lake yesterday. It's starting to look a little soft in places.    Luckily there is safe ice on both sides of this soft section to gain access to the safe 3 foot plus ice beyond.    A random shot on the way to my favorite lake.    Arctic Ice Porn!!!

340032,Sandbag,2009-05-10 18:28:00,533,Very nice report and pics.  really neat to see places that i have never been to before.  Thanks  What camera are you using?  Cheers  Craig
340033,Joeytier,2009-05-10 18:29:00,3990,Beautiful fish.  Looks like a perfect day to spend on the ice.
340042,DRIFTER_016,2009-05-10 18:48:00,10439, The camera is actually my 6 year old Olympus Stylus 300. One of these days I'll have to upgrade. It has taken a beating over the years and it's still kicking though.
340094,Fishing 24/7,2009-05-10 23:00:00,709,awesome report.  still ice up in yellow knife!    thats a nice fish congrats!
340107,solopaddler,2009-05-10 23:28:00,8605,Nice Dave. Have to say I'm glad ice fishing is over with down here though.
340142,irishfield,2009-05-11 00:38:00,26272,Thanks for the ice report Dave. Now get out the flame thrower and onto open water....
340147,DRIFTER_016,2009-05-11 00:50:00,10439,"  Open water, that's a novel idea. The only open water around is the Yellowknife River and part of Yellowknife Bay. The rest is mostly 3 1/2 to 4 feet of solid ice. The boat won't see service for another month or so. I will probably get the 'toon out on some smaller lakes sooer though."
340795,Leecher,2009-05-12 22:37:00,7832,Great report and pics Dave  Now with the sun being 17.5 hours day leaves you with more time for fishing  Good looking laker!!! Congratulations and thanks for sharing Leechman
