340522,Garry2Rs,2009-05-12 01:59:00,1425,"Yes this will work. If you connect red to red and black to black, you have made a bigger 12 volt battery."
340525,dada2727,2009-05-12 02:04:00,108,"Thanks, that's what I thought but wasn't 100% sure.  Now as for an onboard charger, should I get a 2 bank charger to charge both deepcycles?"
340573,DRIFTER_016,2009-05-12 03:56:00,10439,"  Yep, one bank for each battery."
340590,Garry2Rs,2009-05-12 10:01:00,1425,"If you leave the batteries hooked up in series they will recharge together from one charger. This will be slower and the weaker battery might not get a full charge It would be less convenient, but I think recharging them individually would be best, but I'm not 100% sure. Don't over look a three bank charger if there are accessories running off the cranking battery. My three bank came with one set of wires labeled for the cranking battery"
340595,Jer,2009-05-12 10:51:00,1426,"The problem you might have is isolating the batteries for charging.  With both batteries hooked up in parallel to provide only 12V, I don't think you can hook up separate charging banks to each battery without causing some sort of short, or more likely the charger just shutting off because it senses a full charge not coming from the battery, but from the the other charging bank.  You might need some sort of switching mechanism to isolate the batteries from each other for charging (at least the positive side).  ...or I could be totally wrong..."

340689,scugpg,2009-05-12 15:58:00,1373,Is there such thing as a 24V battery that is of similar size to a 12V?
340697,Tybo,2009-05-12 16:25:00,1373,Make sure you hook them up parallel. If you hook them up in series you have 24 volt.  When using multiple batteries. you must start with fresh batteries(new). For your batteries will only be as strong as you weakest. the weaker battery will draw from the other until they are at the same amperage.  You can hook up multiple chargers if the batteries are fresh.
