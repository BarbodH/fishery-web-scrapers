340263,Uncle Buck,2009-05-11 13:34:00,1000,Got out yesterday with a buddy of mine to give the carp a go...  tried Hammy Harbor - Froze like idiots for an hour and a half  switched it up and went down to St. Catherines  for the rest of the morning/afternoon...  Landed my first carp of 09  
340277,fishermccann,2009-05-11 14:14:00,655,"Good job on your first of the year, I too was out for some Carping on Friday . I just happened to be on my favorite eastern trib. and caught my personel best, just over 30 lbs. It looks like it is going to be a  fine year."
340279,Mike Pike,2009-05-11 14:21:00,1332,"The first of many this year for ya, Buck!  Good shootin' and it won't be long for the action to heat up at the harbour!"
340308,Victor,2009-05-11 15:46:00,1609,"Congrats on the 1st of 09!  The bite has been pretty good at the hammy already, i guess the cold front just turned them off a bit."
340322,Gerritt,2009-05-11 16:39:00,6129,"awww crap... Goran, have you switched to the dark side too? Geez man!  G"
340360,Uncle Buck,2009-05-11 19:02:00,1000," No, I'm just waiting for you to call and say lets go trolling...  don't worry i've got 10X the amount of salmon gear compared to carp gear"
340392,jediangler,2009-05-11 20:19:00,1923,"Nice one Buck, what was the bait of choice? Or is it a secret    ."
340428,Uncle Buck,2009-05-11 21:43:00,1000," It's Corn, but don't tell anyone... i don't want the word to get out on my secret bait...  I don't believe that boilies work all that great down here unless you really dump alot of them in there...  for me corn works best... i think i've only caught 1 carp on a boilie"
340438,jediangler,2009-05-11 22:25:00,1923,No secret cherry kool-aid or jello crystals in the mix?
