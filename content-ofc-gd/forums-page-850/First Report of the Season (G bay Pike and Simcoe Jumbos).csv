Thank God  My buddy Bon and I hit Simcoe two weeks ago for some early season perchin. It was an awesome day. We managed to catch around 75 perch. 40 of them were between 10-13” and my bud got a 14.5” Hog. Heres a pic of the Hog.   It was a great day draggin jigs around for perch and alot of action is always good for people new to fishing.   I was planning a three day trip up to Gbay for Pike opener but the Numnuts at school messed up my marks so I had to cancel to sort things out. Managed to get out for the day this Tuesday.  Took my bud Rob out for his first real day fishing and boy was it a good one. It was a gorgeous day but I was worried about the east wind. The fish Didn’t mind the wind tho. We landed 20 fish. 19 Pike and one accidental smallie. We also lost another 10 or so fish. We caught all fish on jerk baits. A lot of  7 and 8lbers and only 3 fish under 5lbs. The real treat was that I got two Hog pike. A 10lber and a 11lber.Most fish had bigger shoulders then last year so guess there healthy. It was a blast. Here are a few of the fish.         sorry about the verticle hold guys         I really needed a day like that after a long year at school. Needless to say, my buddy Rob had a blast his first day fishing. Thanks for reading and love the Quinte reports guys.  Goodluck on the water  Snagmasteral"
