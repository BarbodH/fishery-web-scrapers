Left a little later then I wanted to, but when I left it was warm and sunny. As I got closer, the clouds started rolling in so by the time I got up and settled(unloading the car), it started getting  really cloudy and then some very low dark clouds rolled in.   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-05-09  The thunder and lightning was in the air and sure enough it was a severe storm that passed very quickly. After it passed the sun came out for a while and then more dark clouds rolled in and once again it poured as the skies opened yet again.   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-05-09  So fishing for Crappie on Friday night was out of then question. Then rain continued all night so I sat infront of the BOOB TUBE and watched some hockey and other various sporting activities.  Early Saturday morning there was a nice full moon so I thought that Saturday morning would be nice. By now I was heading out onto the water to get an early start and to get to the Walleye spot where they always seem to be. That was in fact the case as the morning gave way to a sensational early season sunrise.   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-05-09   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-05-09   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-05-09  When I got the spot in question there were 2 other boats there and by the time I left a few hours later, I counted about 15 boats in that one spot with well over 20 in the general area.  In the early season and since it was WALLEYE opener I thought it would be best to throw crankbaits as you could cover lots of water and get it down to the correct depth. I started out by deciding to go with a Rapala Husky Jerk bait and I put on a #10 in the Firetiger color. At around 7 am I hook into something and after bringing it up from the depths, I see that it is in fact a walleye. A small one but one nonetheless. Unfortunately it got off just prior to me landing it. Hard when you have to reel in and man a net all by yourself.  A short time later, once again I hook up with something, This time it is somehting bigger since it feels bigger and puts up a bit more fight, still sluggish so I assumed it was a walleye. I was correct. It measured 23"" and weighed in at 3 lbs 12 oz's. Again caught on the HJ-10 Firetiger. Both fish caught in 8 FOW, water temp was 60 degrees F.  Action was generally slow. Only saw 2 boats land fish, they landed 2 each, so that is 4 into total, for all those boats. Needless to say, I am happier then a Pig in Dung with my efforts. Talked with a few boats and they were not having much luck. The one boat caught his on HJ's also, where as the other boat was jigging the bottom with black bucktail jigs. Heard of one Muskie being caught.   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-05-09  Pulled up to my neighbours dock and he took these pics for me. Thanks MIKE. I kept this fish and I now have some nice walleye filets in the freezer for a future fish fry.   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-05-09   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-05-09  This is the point in time where I post and edit because I'm sure it has happened to all of you, you work on a report then you screw something up and all your efforts are wasted and you start over. PART II  After heading in just after 8 am for breakfast, the skies opened up again slowly then it was an absolute downpour.  After it eased up again I chatted with a couple of guys who weren't having much luck, some small bass and a catfish for them. They asked what I caught mine on so I showed them because they weren't sure what a Husky Jerk looked like. I made a cast and whammo, I hook into a monster bass. They couldn't believe it. I had to take a quick pic and weigh it. It was 4 lbs 8 oz's. Was that illegal, probaly, but it was thrown back right away. Couldn't resist as my buddies wouldn't belive me. Pic is blurry because it was done as fast as possible to not harm the fish in any way.  They mentioned wanting to try out worm harnesses' but they didn't have worms so as my beer fridge is always stocked with worms I decided to give them 2 dozen worms. Hope they brought them some success.   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-05-09   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-05-09  Just as fast as I caught it, the skies opened up yet again. It was on and off all weekend. As it become heavier most of the boats disappeared. The thunder and lightning did not deter the 2 guys I chatted with. I give them credit because they were troppers, not having much luck and to become completely drenched, well 2 thumbs up to you.   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-05-09  Here is what I was looking at from my boathouse as they stuck it out in miserable conditions.  The weather has been so unpredictable lately it makes for some tough fishing. I did however enjoy getting up to the shack and get some fishing in finally. I was very happy to get out onto the water and have some success. In summary I caught 2 walleye, landed 1, caught 3 bass, one monster.  Looking forward to getting out again this week and next weekend. Shawn you better show up this time. I wanted to stay up there tonight and fish and also fish tomorrow but since this is my Wifes first Mothers Day, I just had to come home so I would be here in the morning otherwise I would have been in the doghouse for life if I missed the first one.  Hope everyone had a successful weekend of fishing no matter what you were going for.  Happy Fishing.....DIRK................."

339885,love2fishhave2work,2009-05-10 12:27:00,212,Nice pics and report.  Are small mouth bass in season on Rice these days?
339887,Stoty,2009-05-10 12:30:00,2910," Nope, 4th sat in June everywhere"
339943,limeyangler,2009-05-10 14:21:00,5204,"Great report DJ,  good on ya for giving the worms away.  i love the picture of the boat in the pouring rain."
339948,John,2009-05-10 14:30:00,2956, You guy's crack me up!....
340109,johnnyb,2009-05-10 23:30:00,3413,"Nice work, Dirk...one walleye down....lots to go!"
340173,bassmaster4,2009-05-11 01:49:00,801,"those are some nice fish, glad you had a good opener too bad about the weather though"
340203,EC1,2009-05-11 03:27:00,930,awesome fish dirk!! Haven't heard from you fishing in a while!
340280,fishermccann,2009-05-11 14:23:00,655,"Just wondering is there a slot size on Rice, yes or no will do no need to reference the regs, thanks."
340285,bigreddog,2009-05-11 14:53:00,84,"Yes.  Regardless of license type (sport or conservation), you can keep 1 over 18.1 inches.  The rest of your keep must be 18.1 inches or less."
340303,River Rat,2009-05-11 15:35:00,161,"slot is 4 fish max, all for under 18 inches or 3 under and one over....that one was over 18 but OK to keep as long as there are no other over 18inches in his possesion.  I assume that smallie was caught of the dock and you dipped in for a quick pic ? Just keep in mind, even if you put it in your live well to take it to shore for a pic, the MNR guys would eat you for lunch if the caught you....be careful!  I went to Rice Sunday and looked for my weedline that I slam fish on normally....the wall wasn't well defined yet so I ripped jigs for a bit and decided to move to a weed flat in 8 to 11ft of water....threw a huge swimbait and crwled it along the top of the weed to the ege and whack.....good 4-5lb eye had the thing in his throat on the first cast......I figured I was on to something but that was the only eye I caught.  RR"
340340,diggyj,2009-05-11 17:42:00,548,"Yes it was caught off the dock in about 10-15 FOW. Never put in livewell as the 2 guys can attest to. A quick net job and pic, then relesed immediately.  Can anyone clarify if you can in fact take a pic of an OOS fish? Not 100% sure so I just want to make sure that I have done nothing illegal. I have seen other reports of guys taking pics of OOS fish, so a definate answer would be helpful. I am aware as you mentioned that putting it in the live well would be illegal.  Thanks,  Dirk....."
340346,mj2112,2009-05-11 18:00:00,46,great pics and report.  I fished there about 7 years ago and it was good to see pics of the lake again.
340822,Leecher,2009-05-12 23:17:00,7832,Beauty report Dirk Real nice looking eyes!!!  Congratulations Thanks for sharing Leechman
340832,solopaddler,2009-05-12 23:31:00,8605," Uhhhh, no. Bass are in season right now in Ontario where I fish for them.  Beyond that, beauty walleye Diggy, nice way to start the season."
340894,irishfield,2009-05-13 01:19:00,26272, Well Dirk.. here's the letter from the MNR North Bay District that I carry in the boat (that I finally get a chance to squeeze in with all the other OOS posts locked! LOL)... Question was asked to both CO's and Biologists...They don't have a real issue with it.. unless you have to go get your camera in camp....... I think you came close to that ! 
340898,johnnyb,2009-05-13 01:25:00,3413,"Great post, Wayne!  And the CO's not kidding about the boot thing....I knew a guy who got busted for stuffing the pockets he'd sewn on the inside of his pants with fish that were over his limit!"
