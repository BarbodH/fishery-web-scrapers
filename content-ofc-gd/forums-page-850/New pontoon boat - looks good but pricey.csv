340577,DRIFTER_016,2009-05-12 04:11:00,10439,There are plenty of other toons out there that are more reasonably priced. They generally start around $350 and go up from there.  I have a OUTCAST FISH CAT COUGAR and it is a very good quality toon. Remember you get what you pay for. There is a good representation available through the Fishing Hole.  The Fishin' Hole
