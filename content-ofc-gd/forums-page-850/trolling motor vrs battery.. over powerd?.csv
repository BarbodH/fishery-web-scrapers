340325,fish-miester,2009-05-11 16:57:00,864,"hey guys , so i watched a guy ""magiver"" his bow mount trolling motor (which is supose to run off a 12volt) to a 24volt marine battery on the weekend.. the original orings wouldnt fit on so he basicly just strapped them on with clamps..  was wondering what would happen to the trolling motor if you used the wrong sized battery..? aka its supose to use a 12 volt , but he has it hooked up to a 24 volt.  will this kill / fry his motor or will anything happen to it ? very currious lol.."
340326,Billy Bob,2009-05-11 17:01:00,5865, I am bilingual (English & Canadian) but I have no idea what your trying to say........
340327,cranks bait,2009-05-11 17:05:00,721,"If he hooked two batteries up in parrellel he will be fine (I did this with my starting batteries cause my fishfinder and live wells suck a lot of juice).  It's still twelve volts, it'll just last longer.  If he wired it up in series he has made a twenty four volt.  Motor will not be so good."
340328,fish-miester,2009-05-11 17:10:00,864,"he has his new min kota powerdrive hooked up directly to a 24volt battery. he said ""im sure it will be ok"" haha"
340329,Tybo,2009-05-11 17:10:00,1373,He wired it to 12 volt. one battery. This is not a good. It will draw more from the one. decreasing the power in both. In mutable batts set up. Your batts are as strong as the weakest one.
340333,fish-miester,2009-05-11 17:22:00,864,"he took his 24volt batery he uses in his 20 bay liner, and put it in his fishing boat to hook up to his trolling motor.. but the trolling motor is supose to be used with 12volt batteries   what could happen?"
340335,Sinker,2009-05-11 17:26:00,8692,I'm not sure you can buy a 24V battery........can you?  Sinker
340336,scugpg,2009-05-11 17:26:00,1373,"Its not meant for that....oddly enough I was talking to a guy one day who had a 12v powerdrive hooked up to 24v and he told me ""they can handle it"""
340337,fish-miester,2009-05-11 17:33:00,864,haha if you didnt live in london i would think you were talking about the same guy .. lol  im 99% sure it was a 24.. and it ran everything in his bayliner ...  i just wanted to warn him if it could mess his trolling motor up.. :S
340349,Billy Bob,2009-05-11 18:14:00,5865,"I never seen a 24 volt ""battery"".  But if you are hooking up a 12 volt motor to a 24 volt system bad things can happen, bad things........... ........ ....."
340357,bassjnkie,2009-05-11 19:00:00,1101,"24v source hooked up to a 12v system. I don't think that good, but if you see BLUE smoke, it's done."
340365,wallyboss,2009-05-11 19:17:00,1095,"Never heard of a 24v battery.  A 24v system yes, but not a single battery."
340373,Roy,2009-05-11 19:33:00,13728,Not common but lots of 24 volt batteries around...even Optima has a nice one. $450 or something and almost 100 lbs.
340417,DanD,2009-05-11 21:30:00,2223,"I’ve seen a lot of systems wired with cranking and accessory batteries in series parallel configuration; like the diagram below. It does away with having a third battery or a converter/transformer for 12 volts, to crank the engine or run other 12 volt devices. Maybe this guy was doing the same thing by only connecting to the one battery of a 24 volt battery pack and didn’t feel like or couldn’t go into an explanation. When using one of the batteries to power a 12 volt device it will not drain the other battery. The only time both batteries are being drained by one device is if the device is connected to the 24 volt circuit. As for connecting a 12 volt trolling motor too 24; man do they ever spin fast for a short period of time and it’s amazing how much heat & smoke can come out of such a small unit. It’s not a complete lost though; on that ONE colder day, he’ll have a place to warm his hands; in mosquito season he can fog the bushes in that back bay. Just thought of another good reason to try this; he’ll get an upper body workout; as he’s paddling the boat out of that bay. Sorry my attempt at humor. LOL I do agree with Tybo that the total amount of available voltage depends on the condition and state of charge of both batteries.  Dan.  "
340431,fish-miester,2009-05-11 22:04:00,864,so all in all bad idea ? lol i'l let him no .. i just didnt want to sound like the retarted neigbor
340506,irishfield,2009-05-12 01:23:00,26272,12 volt item on a 24 volt supply... releases the magic smoke.    It's called magic smoke because everything works while it's still hidden inside.. but nothing works when it's released!  Like Roy said.. plenty of 24 volt batteries out there... they're actually called 28 volt in the Aircraft world.
340508,Garry2Rs,2009-05-12 01:24:00,1425,Some trolling motors are twelve or twenty-four volt. These can be run on either set-up
