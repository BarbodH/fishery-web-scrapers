340369,BabyHerc,2009-05-11 19:23:00,285,"I'm looking for a 7'6"" Avid spinning rod.  I've checked Fishing World, JB, Angling Specialties, Tightlines and Bass Pro for this rod.  Any other St Croix dealers likely to carry it?"
340378,Jackie,2009-05-11 19:53:00,124,Try Lucky Fishing Tackle at the SE corner of Midland and Sheppard.  Also try Grimsby Tackle if you're in that area.  My friend got an 8' Avid spinning from them last fall for a very good price.
340400,ryansusanna,2009-05-11 20:39:00,27,"Give Chad a call at rainbowsports.ca, i am sure he will order for you if he does not have in stock.  i know he carries a lot of st. croix"
340403,Bondar,2009-05-11 20:53:00,817,Peters in St.Catharines has st.croix

340406,JDMITR,2009-05-11 20:57:00,12,Here is a link to the St Croix dealers in Canada.  http://www.stcroixrods.com/dealers/canada.asp
340408,bigreddog,2009-05-11 20:59:00,84,Gagnon's Sports also carries St. Croix.  I've had Angling Specialties (Mississauga) order for me in the past with good results.

340433,BabyHerc,2009-05-11 22:10:00,285,Thanks!
340435,Billy Bob,2009-05-11 22:16:00,5865,Cabela's has a LARGE selection of St Croix rods. A bit expensive for my taste but if you can afford it go for it. Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page to get to the St Croix rods.  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...rentId=cat20166
340441,bigpikemike,2009-05-11 22:33:00,52,believe it or not but walmart now carries them
340451,wallyboss,2009-05-11 22:46:00,1095,So does CTC they carry a small choice of the Premier series.
340491,bigbuck,2009-05-12 00:46:00,2449,"I'd imagine Steve or Brian at JB's would order one in for you, as would any of the other dealers mentioned."
340516,mjack 7,2009-05-12 01:42:00,22,"I had someone call me last week and ask for the same model. AVS76ml2. Not sure if it was you but we had it instock. (Fishing world). If you did not want to drive to Hamilton, It would be less than $15 shipped."
340578,Forester,2009-05-12 04:29:00,46,"If you are in richmond hill, you can also try Pro J tackle on Sheppard just one block east of Warden. Last time I saw they have a few different models of avid there."
340579,Hooked,2009-05-12 04:34:00,891,"Are you fixed on St. Croix?  I found that the 7'-6"" Shimano Crucial had a way better feel to it, but that's just me.  I actually settled for the 7'-2"" Crucial, it's awesome.  It's a tough size to find though, usually stores will only carry a couple that size.  Quantum also carries that size if you are interested, a Tour PT at Grimsby Tackle, maybe FW too.  Think I seen a Cumara that size too, which is a ridiculously awesome rod.  Good luck"
