340416,wallyboss,2009-05-11 21:29:00,1095,"In 2 different paragraphs , In the paragraph that talks about photograph says nothing about releasing immediatly.  Compare apples to apples.  The point here is OOS fish should be released immediatly period.  Then they say if you catch fish and you want to take a picture do it quickly.  Show me where it says if you catch an OOS fish you can take a picture then release it !!! Then I will agree. If CO's can't make up there mind how are we supposed to.  You think you're right and I think I am right."
340420,bigpikemike,2009-05-11 21:33:00,52,when fishing trout we got a couple of trout and one 8lb splake...we were using spinners and unfortunately we caught some oos bass...as my buddy was unhooking the fish i would snap a pic on the fishes way back into the lake or vice versa...and we had a great shore lunch of splake                  
340423,cram,2009-05-11 21:34:00,1733,"Depends entirely on the CO.  There is more htan one rule in the regs that relies on subjective judgement.  I suspect this is by design so that the CO can apply if/when the fisherman is taking advantage of rules and/or just needs an attitude adjustment.  For example - is it legal to fish for musky (with plans to release all catches) with a conservation license?   Some COs will say its fine as long as you ""immediately release""....some will say its illegal to target muskies without a full blown license.  Further, if its illegal to take a picture of an OOS fish, is it illegal to take a picture of a 47 inch musky in a region where the minimum size is 48 inches?  Lots of rules that could be applied if the CO thinks you need some attitude adjustment."
340426,Terry,2009-05-11 21:39:00,14456,"well it doesn't but  in the release tips they use the term must be Immediately released, then in the next paragraph in the tips on release section it states to take a picture...are you saying Immediately mean one thing here and another thing if the fish is OOS or are you saying that if you are releasing a fish you can't ever take a picture you can't have it both way either they stated  ""release the fish Immediately, but if you want to take a picture do it quickly"" or  release the fish Immediately, but if you want to take a picture you must keep the fish because you did not release it Immediately   oh and as for the muskie thing, it's on there website, you can catch a muskie with a con lic. and it goes on to say see tips on releasing fish.. where it states if you want to take a picture do it quickly.....just because some COs are misinformed we can't all live in fear.....if it's on their website you have the law on your side"
340427,wallyboss,2009-05-11 21:40:00,1095,"BPM   this is taken form the OFC rules  ""We would prefer that you do not post pictures of fish caught out of season. ""  Seems like you enjoy rubbing people the wrong way.  Possibly why you got booted from F-H. cause they have the same rule.   Terry it all comes down to you agree with it  and I don't. You won't change your  mind and I won't change mine!!!"

Isn't the internet a lot like TV or the radio?... if you see/hear something you don't like, turn the channel/page or turn it off!!!  I've seen the 2 pics in question here, the one in the boat is perfectly acceptable in my opinion!!!... I sure that fish was released in a very timely manner!  The one in the boathouse, maybe not so acceptable... but I'm sure both fish swam away happy to be alive, not that much worse off for wear and tear, and to make make many more baby fishes!!!  The fishermen were proud of their catches and just wanted to share!  If you're not too lazy or ignorant to read the entire regs... you'll see that it isn't illegal to take a pic of an OOS fish!"

340456,MCTFisher9120,2009-05-11 22:52:00,3761," lol, BPM didn't bug me. Guess there's at least one happy OFC member.  *Please Advise* This thread will be closed in the near future as people are constantly flaming  each other, as the last OOS thread was closed. It's not necessary to continuously  say that fish need to be put back ""Immediately"" over 20 times is it. Some people don't understand the consequences to fish leaving the nest and others do. All we can do is advise anglers and tell them to limit the time out of water both for unhooking the fish and for a photograph when necessary . The only problem i have is when people are taking pictures of every singe OOS fish they catch big or small. Obviously bigger fish have the bigger nests, but why bother taking pictures of smaller bass like BPM did.  Not much else to say as everybody else did but come on people, settle down and be cautious when fishing. If you catch a OOS fish, move on and be smart.   Mike"
340458,Guest gbfisher,2009-05-11 22:56:00,0,  Now everyone is weighing them....lol
340460,bigfish1965,2009-05-11 22:57:00,3382,"Okay...everyone take a time out... Remember that the summary of the regulations you get are NOT THE LAW. The law does not say you must immediately release a fish..it just says you cannot possess said fish. It goes the same for out of slot fish...you may not possess the fish, but THE LAW does not say you must do it immediately...same deal with a musky on a conservation license. The LAW is written in two parts, one Federal, one Provincial with Provincial being the lions share.  Now go read the LAWS not the readers digest version. Even the summary this year gives an unofficial okay to take a pic in its release directions."
340351,diggyj,2009-05-11 18:35:00,548,"Can anyone confirm what the rules are regarding taking pictures of OOS Fish? Is it legal or not? I have seen it done in many reports and all of them say released immediately. Any clarification would be great as this is a topic I do not know the correct answer to.  I am aware that storing them in a livewell for pictures is 100% illegal and should never be done but can you take a quick pic and release it thereafter?  Thanks,  Dirk.........."
340352,bdox,2009-05-11 18:41:00,329,Here is a quote from the MNR website.   Link
340353,brifishrgy,2009-05-11 18:42:00,559,
340355,e-z-out,2009-05-11 18:43:00,1052,You know it's a bass or another OOS fish unhook it and let it go in the water no need to bring it out. Your fishing with a friend have that friend take the picture of the fish at the side of the boat. Makes for a better picture and your not the bad guy for posting it out of the water. There is no need for it to ever leave the water even to unhook.
340366,highdrifter,2009-05-11 19:17:00,2534," I second that notion.  Emmediatly, meaning not taking the fish out of the water, walking over to budday's boat shed with it to take a picture.  Emmediatly.  Too bad there's no Laymen term for it eh?!"
340368,purekgw,2009-05-11 19:22:00,585,its not always that easy tho when we were up north for walleye opener my dad got a musky and we had to bring it in the boat to unhook it there was no other way
340374,shane,2009-05-11 19:34:00,652,"  I would put that in the same category as speeding to the hospital when you have a woman about to give birth in the car. Justifiable something or other.  Otherwise, I agree with Highdrifter and Aile.  Leave them in the water."
340376,e-z-out,2009-05-11 19:38:00,1052,If you have a good set of cutters just cut the hooks off. Easier said then done i know when it comes to muskies.
340377,Terry,2009-05-11 19:49:00,14456,"nice but in my boat I have to lean way over to unhook a fish in the water and many boats like Waynes big lund you need to bring them on board and torpedo them back into the water to release them, many charter boat  are the same, way too high to do what you  suggest  and if you think it's against the law then who is breaking the law, the guy holding the fish or the guy taking the picture cause often I take a picture of the other guy holding a fish  by saying his name while he is unhooking it he looks up to see what I want and I snap the picture..love to see him get a ticket for that...... the mnr talks about catch and release and say to take a picture quickly and to remember if you don't release it immediately it counts against your limit......which, without a doubt implies/states/says you can unhook it , take a picture  and still  immediately  release a fish ""cut and paste from MNR website Here are some tips for successful catch-and-release:   Angling    * Use barbless hooks; avoid using live or organic bait. * Reduce the time a fish is played. * Angling-induced stress and mortality increase considerably as water temperatures increase.  Generally, the cooler the water the better the chance a released fish will live.  Taking a fish from deep, cool water up to warm surface water can be especially stressful.  If you plan to release your catch, avoid fishing during extremely hot periods of the summer.   Handling    * Keep the fish in the water as much as possible and handle the fish gently. * Reduce handling that removes the slimy protective coating on fish. * Do not squeeze or touch the gills. Grasp the fish just behind the gill covers. For panfish and bass, it is best to grasp the fish by the lower lip. * Use long-nose pliers to remove the hook quickly without tearing or injuring the fish. If the fish is hooked deeply, cut the line and leave the hook in when the fish is released. * Never put a fish that you may release on a stringer, use a functional livewell or release the fish immediately. Remember that all fish kept (in a livewell, on a stringer, etc.) and not immediately released count toward your daily catch and retain or possession limit.   Photographing    * Be ready ahead of time! Take pictures quickly, minimizing the amount of time the fish is out of the water. * Hold the fish in a horizontal position, supporting its weight with your arm and hands. Do not hold large fish in a vertical position.  Releasing    * Revive the fish before letting go. Hold the fish upright in a swimming position in the water, moving the fish slowly forward and backward so water runs through the gills. * Ensure the fish is breathing and can swim away under its own power before it is released.    Remember the future of fishing is in your hands!"""
340380,e-z-out,2009-05-11 19:56:00,1052,Well put Terry With some boats you have to bring the fish out and with others there is no need to do so. So use common sence Guy
340381,Stoty,2009-05-11 19:57:00,2910,"As long as the fish is released (in a timely manner), who really cares if you take the extra 10 seconds (literally) to take a picture??  Heck, trying to keep the fish in the water to unhook it, for lots of people, would actually take longer and do MORE harm than bringing it into the boat, unhook, picture, and release."
340382,LeXXington,2009-05-11 20:01:00,1928,OOS fish catches happen if you want too or not. Sometimes they live sometimes they die. Its part of fishing.  Even the pro's take pictures..
340383,Crazyhook,2009-05-11 20:02:00,1154,"Releasing    * Revive the fish before letting go. Hold the fish upright in a swimming position in the water, moving the fish slowly forward and backward so water runs through the gills. * Ensure the fish is breathing and can swim away under its own power before it is released.   I know this was taken from the MNR website... moving a fish back and forth is NOT a way to revive them. How many fish have you seen swimming backwards... fish should just be moved forwards and NOT backwards.... my 2 cents"
340384,Terry,2009-05-11 20:03:00,14456,"yeah I really think the problem is people think well if I can take a picture, then I must be allowed to catch it and if I can catch it, I must be able to fish for it'. so I will go out this weekend and fish for bass OOS..and that is not the case........you must not can not fish for OOS fish period......"
340385,bushart,2009-05-11 20:04:00,2628,Have I just entered a star trek time warp and gone back to Saturday?  This is where Roy shows up and says ok a father got lambasted for this scenario some time back...lock er up  Mr Chekov warp 5 and bones I'll need 10 cc's rye and coke stat...
340387,MCTFisher9120,2009-05-11 20:09:00,3761," Why would you cut the hook, I can understand if the hooking was really bad but if the hooks can be removed within a minute or 2 then take the time to get the hooks out. I don't think a OOS Musky want's to be on there bed(if they have beds like the bass do) with a big hook in it's mouth.  Maybe I'm wrong I just think that it would be better to have the hooks out."
340388,jediangler,2009-05-11 20:11:00,1923,"If you follow the law, as it is, you cannot take a picture of an OOS fish. Immediately means just that. Not measuring, not weighing and not mugging for a camera. You can do as you please, but don't try and justify breaking a law because: 1) that species hasn't started to spawn yet, 2) It was the biggest one of that species that you've ever caught (PB Poachers Best) or 3) because you want to show off the fish in your report on OFC."
340394,Burning Babies,2009-05-11 20:24:00,150,"I can't speak directly to the laws in Ontario, but in Ohio, the intention of specifying immediate release is to prevent someone from from putting a fish in a livewell or stringer for release later.  Law enforcement here is not going to ding you for snapping a quick picture.  I would suggest anyone concerned about this consulting with the MNR, rather than relying on the OFC legal department, however."
340396,Terry,2009-05-11 20:29:00,14456,"jediangler, you are wrong Immediately means within a reasonable time that will not affect the health of the fish Immediately means quickly the mnr stated and I already posted it, Immediately mean not putting it on a stringer or livewell but you can take a picture..not the MNR state that on their website , so how can you argue.... if a cop is following you and over their PA system call out pull over Immediately, do you  pull over that very second, because they said Immediately, even if that means running over people walking or a parked car, but they said Immediately, so you kill 3 people well don't be stupid, they mean pull over in a reasonable amount of time when it is safe.....and that is what Immediately means in the law, within a reasonable amount of time and if the fishing world it means in a timely fashion that will not cause more harm to the fish ...  it s not against the law to take a picture of a fish, get over it"
340397,anders,2009-05-11 20:30:00,1168,"this is like the old saying ""beating a dead horse""....wow!!"
340404,Guest gbfisher,2009-05-11 20:55:00,0,Some funny comments. Its truly hilarious that most don't know the rules regarding fishing regulations. Taking pictures of OOS fish is completely LEGAL. No harm done and as Terry said. .............GET OVER IT!..
340410,highdrifter,2009-05-11 21:05:00,2534, Maybe you outta get over yourself?!
340411,wallyboss,2009-05-11 21:10:00,1095,"But it also doesn't mean that you can pull over, get out of your car , get your buddy to take your picture then see what the police officer wants??? Immediatly means just that.  As soon you can.   If they meant as soon as you can after taking a picture and weighing it they would've said so. It is against the law  You get over it!!!!!"
340412,Radnine,2009-05-11 21:15:00,1538,"Do yourself a favour Digs, show us the walleye, save the bass. Jim"
340414,Terry,2009-05-11 21:21:00,14456,"wallyboss, then you did not read my cut and paste from the MNR website, they use the word ""Immediately"" then said take a picture but do it quickly, the only thing you can read into it is, they are using the  legal definition of the word Immediately, to mean in a timely fashion that will not cause more harm to the fish,  again they say release  the fish Immediately, but if you want to take a picture do it quickly what else can that mean but yes you can take a picture"
