340185,irishfield,2009-05-11 02:14:00,26272,My f-in-law bought himself a 16' Keylargo last season to play out on the Sound in. I'd never seen it 'till last night. Not a bad little unit..    Couldn't think of anything for him for Christmas.. so stupid me bought him a Mag 10 Cannon Downrigger for it from North East Shark (thanks for the deal Darrell). Only issue with that is of course I get stuck installing it. I forgot all about it 'til the f-in-law shows up with the boat last night and says how come you haven't installed this yet !  Noticed the trailer lights weren't working when he brought it over. Not surprising with the Dutch man... but figured I might as well have a look and sort that out for him now... cause it'll just be me later anyhow! Step one is always GROUND. Slap a set of booster cables on and usually the problems disappear. Nope.. gonna be a long day.    How many times can you splice the tongue wire??    Heck... #12 house wire and some marretts    Well why not.. I guess it works 'till those solid wires break from vibration and the marretts rott off.    Why you should use some chafe protection.. bare wires sparking in the frame.    What it should look like... just need to hook the white ground to the frame.    Now with that all done I can finally get onto what I was supposed to be doing. Swivel base didn't fit the gunnel area... so whip out the router... it's not my boat!    Spot all ready to drill the holes. Two outer right thru the gunnel edge flange for bolts/washers/nuts and the inner two holes received well nuts/rivnuts/threadserts... which ever you wanna call them.    Drilled a hole thru his battery box area.. hooked that up (fused) and he's good to go.    Figured the day was toast at this point anyhow.. so I drained and refilled his lower unit and then proved a small household garbage can fits a 50 merc just fine. Started right up and peeeeee'd great.    Now I can get it out of here and pray he has nothing else for me....

340191,ohhenrygsr,2009-05-11 02:23:00,947,Wow what a mess.  I'm sure them transducers won't give him any interference what so ever
340193,irishfield,2009-05-11 02:31:00,26272,The middle large unit is a brand new Garmen map unit and it's speed sensor to the left.. the other on the right some old fishfinder. He thinks they work fine... I'm not asking any question! lol
340205,carp-starter,2009-05-11 03:43:00,253,Aaaaaaaaah...... The joys of being married..........  carp-starter
340235,Billy Bob,2009-05-11 11:43:00,5865,He know needs another downrigger for the other side (Father's Day)
340238,corvette1,2009-05-11 12:01:00,1765,hey irish you know the saying if it ain't broke don't fix it
340239,doubleheader,2009-05-11 12:03:00,497,You're a good son-in-law.
340246,JohnAB,2009-05-11 12:36:00,178,Good job all around.
340258,limeyangler,2009-05-11 13:24:00,5204,"Thanks for posting that, laughing still at the 'peeeeed' bit........it does look like that lol.  my ucnles trailer lights are also a pain....i think its the earth too...good tip using the jumper cables...will try that."
340261,bigbuck,2009-05-11 13:30:00,2449,I thought you were on your way up to Temagami.
340270,irishfield,2009-05-11 14:03:00,26272, So did I....
340273,POLLIWOGG,2009-05-11 14:06:00,835,"Tip for trailer lights ---for the price of a light kit, just replace everything when it looks like that.  My buddy with a garage says its cheaper for the customer to replace it than hunt down the problem."
340301,LeXXington,2009-05-11 15:28:00,1928,"Cool, nice rig for sure.,."
340317,Fisherman,2009-05-11 16:07:00,7201,"Ya, but if it was installed right in the first place, with proper dedicated grounds to each light fixture, then you don't have that problem."
340476,irishfield,2009-05-12 00:11:00,26272," Ah.. okay, he can do it his way ( I know what he's saying at $90/hr shop rate), but no reason to do so for the guy in his yard DIY. One tongue plug $5 and maybe 35 feet of (aircraft) wire... oh and 2 #194 bulbs for his side lights and it's as bright as it could be. And yes Fisherman.. each light has it's own ground strap bolted to the frame.. not slipped under the attach bolt like Easy Hauler in North Bay does...without scrapping the paint off under it I might add!"
340478,Terry,2009-05-12 00:18:00,14456,no wonder you can't get away  could you look at my front trolling motor the shaft is bend  oh wait that was last year....LOL
340479,irishfield,2009-05-12 00:22:00,26272,  You called that BENT ! Exploded maybe.. kinda like breaking pasta for the pot...
340487,bigbuck,2009-05-12 00:40:00,2449,"Well, if you don't make it up anytime soon, I know all about drs. appts and the like, we'll be up at our new trailer in Honey Harbour if you feel the need to wet a line."
340494,irishfield,2009-05-12 00:54:00,26272,"Thanks bigbuck.. that's exactly what we're waiting for, but hopefully we can head North Friday am."
340558,ohhenrygsr,2009-05-12 03:22:00,947,Hey wayne what's your f-in-law's number.  I gotta tell him there's interference with the transducers maybe you can help him fix that.
