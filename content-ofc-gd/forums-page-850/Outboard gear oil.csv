I was wondering since I will not have a chance to visit my Yamaha dealer to pick up Yamaha oil will the Nautilis SAE90 gear oil be suitable for the lower unit on a 2005 F90 4 stroke?  Thanks"

340634,wallyboss,2009-05-12 13:09:00,1095,Did you change the gear oil when you winterized it.  That is when you should change it.  If you did no need to re-change it.
340693,Tybo,2009-05-12 16:10:00,1373,Any 80w90 gear oil will work.
340694,bigpikemike,2009-05-12 16:16:00,52,just dont mix synthetic with organic oils....make sure u buy the pump and pump the oil in for the bottom hole
340705,Billy Bob,2009-05-12 17:01:00,5865, I agree 100%.  OR you can spend twice as much and get the same gear oil in a fancy Yamaha labeled bottle.......
340720,scugpg,2009-05-12 18:10:00,1373,Get amsoil synthetic gear oil. Its good stuff and like $10 a quart.
