Was planning on camping on Crown Land on the shore of Ivanhoe and then Horwood Lakes. Pass through the area on the way to Moose camp every year but have never stopped there. Any suggestions for other road access fishing lakes I should try while up in that area?? Going up with a 12 foot aluminum so I'll be very portable.  How about suggestions on the best locations to put up a tent (road name, location)?  Thanks in advance for the help on this one!!!"
