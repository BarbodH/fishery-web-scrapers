340386,digitalkreation,2009-05-11 20:07:00,25,"Hi all,  I want to give my motor (1986 9.9HP Johnson) a nice checkup and have just received my TinyTach in the mail.  I want to also check compression, but am not wanting to waste time in getting the wrong one.  Can I find a decent one at Princess Auto or Crappy Tire?  I know that outboards sometimes have a weird size plug (different from cars), so if anyone has one for a small Johnson, could you steer me to a place to pick one up?  Many thanks, Mark"

340486,BITEME,2009-05-12 00:40:00,1968,Canadian tire they have threaded adaptors in different sizes included dont get press fit rubber
340497,DRIFTER_016,2009-05-12 01:00:00,10439, The one I posted has the threaded adapters as well as the press fit rubber and should fit any engine. They also have a kit with only the threaded adapters that you can purchase and return if the adapters don't fit.
340635,Whitespinnerbait,2009-05-12 13:10:00,2038,1986 9.9 Johnson   Compression test ????  That motor is not even broken in yet...Should be good for a Million hours before a compression test is required

There are many things that could affect compression including a cracked reed valve, cylinder scoring from wrong fuel mixture or overheating. A simple compression check will let him know if all is ok. Peace of mind is worth $50, no?"
