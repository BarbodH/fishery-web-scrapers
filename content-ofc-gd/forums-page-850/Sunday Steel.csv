The pay-off was three nice fish out of 5 in just a few hours of fishing. Water was quite muddy, but trying a few trick I was able to coax a few steel on the run.   Here's a fiesty male that put up a very nice fight.       This hen took me for a nice long run downstream in a strong current and went straight under a long overhanging tree and appeared about 8 feet on the other side. Had to keep the rod tip way low in the water to keep it from getting all tangled up. Lost one previously after it ran under a big log and jumped out on the other side, so I was extra determined not to fall victim to another tree. Luckily I got it to shore.     Here's another spunky male. "

Bringing them in the mud and sand for picture, is it really worth it?  Pic number 2 looks great!  Still in the water.  Keep in mind that the mud, dirt and sand remove that slimy coating that protects them from disease."
