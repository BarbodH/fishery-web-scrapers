340618,dakota,2009-05-12 12:20:00,7,"for transporting fish you are required to pack they for easy counting and also leave a patch of skin for indentification. What is the proper way to transport walleye ,now with the new size regulation how do they know if that fish was 17 3/4"" or 18 1/2"". Rob"
340622,bigugli,2009-05-12 12:29:00,6138,"With the size limits, as with slot sizes, you must transport the fish whole, gutted."
340623,Greencoachdog,2009-05-12 12:31:00,8163,"The best way to transport any fish is to ""field dress"" them.  A slit up the gut starting at the anal vent and going all the way to the chin, run your knife around each gill and the guts and gills will come out in one piece if done properly... this leaves the body of the fish intact with the head on... the fish will keep much better this way while in transport.  Any CO that stops you to check your fish while in transport will definitely be impressed, minimizing and problems you might encounter."
340679,anders,2009-05-12 15:07:00,1168,"I have also seen a CO with a chart with measurements, to measure the fillets...dont know how accurate this would be, i guess just to give an estimate...i wouldnt chance it though"
