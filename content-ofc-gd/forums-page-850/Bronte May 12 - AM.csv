Fished 140-160 fow, 40 feet down. Had a deep rod too (100') but no go there. Spoon bite (had flies but no go). NK NBK and Green and Silver. Two on the leadcore and two on the riggers. Here is the Blackberry shot. Sorry for the picture quality:    Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

As for the camera, probly needs a cleaning like mine did.. Couldn't believe the difference afterwards.. Even have before and after shots! Just use a Qtip with a little rubbing alcohol diped on the end.. and roll it between your fingers to clean the lens. do that 2-3 times each time with a fresh Qtip. Make sure you only get enough alcohol to dampen the end.. You don't want it dripping wet. and then use a final clean dry Qtip to buff it up, don't use much pressure thou.. And your good to go! Surprisingly Blackberrys can can decent quality shots for the web! And during the day set it with flash off! Not auto."
