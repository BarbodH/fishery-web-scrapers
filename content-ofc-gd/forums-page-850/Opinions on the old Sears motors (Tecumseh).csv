Would only start at full throttle and would only run at full throttle and was the most unreliable piece of crap I owned (at the time.  ). I once owned a Dodge after that."

I had one years ago too and it was a fine motor (noisy) as long as I went over it every second trip and retightened every screw and bolt on it.  I thought about loctite briefly but then, if you ever had to do repairs, you'd have trouble getting it apart."
