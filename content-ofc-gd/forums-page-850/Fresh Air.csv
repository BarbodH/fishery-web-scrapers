Over the past week and some, perch have been up into various inlets and ponds from L Ontario. Provides for 3-4 weeks of shallow water perch fishing. I had the whole area all to myself again with bright sunshine and a gentle offshore breeze. Being there quiet and content, it is wonderful to see such a diversity of birds and fowl that are making a comeback. Saw my first wood duck, locally in years, a little green heron, 2 pairs of kingfisher, but they were not close enough for a pic.  Two blue herons came in to feed on the schools of minnows, and were totally oblivious to my presence.   They were followed shortly after by the family. They weren't more than 10 feet away.   Almost forgot, I did do some fishing. Lots of perch and a couple of crappie. Was in such a rush to get supper started, forgot to take a pic until after they were carved. Kept enough for dinner. "

340901,bigugli,2009-05-13 01:32:00,6138,Sometimes Ma Nature's show is as enjoyable as the fishing and then some. Only one tiny teeny problem. I was so busy watching the birds I missed twice as many fish as I caught
