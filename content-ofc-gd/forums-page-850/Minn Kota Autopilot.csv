340257,scugpg,2009-05-11 13:21:00,1373,Hi all - I'm upgrading my Minn Kota powerdrive and I'm wondering if I should consider getting the autopilot feature on my next powerdrive (or Terrova). How do you guys like the autopilot on the powerdrives? I have the co-pilot already and love it but wondered if the autopilot is something to really consider as well.  thanks - scugog

It tracked a line with no problems and made it easier to hold along structure lines while I was actually fishing.  When I get my next boat, I will definitely get both (autopilot and co-pilot) when I buy the trolling motor.  One thing I found was that the Universal Sonar was not very good.  Hope this helps.

340289,cranks bait,2009-05-11 15:07:00,721,I love the auto pilot.  My big motor doesn't troll down slow enough.  So I use the bow mount.  I forgot about the auto feature and was constantly playing with the pedal.   Then I remembered and set it and forget it.  I trolled for about an hour on auto while sitting with my feet up.  Life was great.
340530,scugpg,2009-05-12 02:24:00,1373,Do you guys find in Autopilot does it steer smoothly (in small increments?) or is it have larger adjustments and go back and forth.  I noticed the co-pilot steers way better than the Powerdrive pedal.

340636,cranks bait,2009-05-12 13:15:00,721," The auto is way smoother than the pedal.  It moves in tiny increments instead of over shooting like I do manually.  I'll lean it this summer, hopefully?  I had the wind blow me sideways off couse once.  All I had to do was manually steer where I wanted to go and it readjusted itself.  No need to get out of the chair and turn it off.  Just steer to where you want to go.  I find I steer much better with my hands.  Maybe I should try holding my fishing rod with my toes?"
