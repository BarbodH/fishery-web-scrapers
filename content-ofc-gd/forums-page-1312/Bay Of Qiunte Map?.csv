5028,irishfield,2006-11-25 16:59:00,26272,Don...the one you need isn't available at BPS. Only one they don't have on the shelf. They have it in the office at Merland..$20
5036,bigfish1965,2006-11-25 17:46:00,3382,Where did you find this information?  Don..are you a member of the SCGFA? If so I have charts somewhere and if you're going to the meeting Monday I'll bring them there.
5038,Dondorfish,2006-11-25 17:51:00,1000,Thanks guys - weather I am required to have one or not - I will pick one up as I would like to have one on board. I did receive a great topo map from one of our board members that will fit the bill nicely - just have to get new cartridges for the printer so I can print one off. Thanks again to the board member!   Don

5144,Dondorfish,2006-11-26 00:40:00,1000,Sorry Rick - didn't see your reply. No I am not a member as of yet. I will probably be joining in the spring. I am aware of the club and the good things that it does. I have not fished the Great Lakes much in the last 15 years but now I find myself gaining interest again. Hope to get out on Erie and Ontario in the spring before the boat heads north to the trailer for the summer. I did get a very good map sent to me by a board member and in turn I sent it to my wife's computer and she printed it off for me. Thanks for the kind offer thou.     Don
