I ended up buying an AquaVu Scout XL on Ebay for a great price.  Unfortunatly he (my husband) saw the web page on the computer, put two and two together and knew what he was getting..... He went fishing for the day today and took the camera out (so much for waiting 'till Christmas morning) but he loves it so what's a month or so in the scheme of things. But anyways, thanks for the input, it was a great help! "

5207,theoldlady,2006-11-26 05:19:00,3,"sorry, I guess I could've said that since he's already used it. It's iceguy on the old board I said a lot of you know him but I was exaggerating, he's met a few of you but I didn't want to lead him to guess it was for him."
