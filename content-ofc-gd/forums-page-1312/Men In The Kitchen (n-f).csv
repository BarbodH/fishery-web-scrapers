4429,PatB,2006-11-23 23:37:00,104,"I do most of the cooking around the place, the wife only eats that green stuff. She won't touch my venison, elk or caribou even fish she leaves that to me. I love cooking, trying different things. Our Christmas lunch at work we all to take in something, this year is dessert. Chocolate Turtle Cheese Cake....."
4440,douG,2006-11-24 00:14:00,2693,"PatB cooks just fine,  thank you very much.  He drives a BBQ like Steve McQueen, and his chili is not that bad at all, considering.  I know that pic in your avatar, Pat.  Could that indeed be Lake Babaganouche?"
4449,Daplumma,2006-11-24 00:28:00,1961,I do all of the cooking and shopping during the week and she cooks on the weekend if i get the stuff.She is a great cook but I have more time and do a pretty good job.Over the last winter I made two rooms into a big litchen so I could have a bit more room.   
4467,skiel,2006-11-24 01:06:00,30,main cook here. The wife is exceptional at making reservations and other entertaining things.....
4470,Whopper,2006-11-24 01:16:00,2174,"daplumma I'm just glad your stove works!  I cook on the BBQ all year round and have been known to put a few other meals together.  Cooked a 23lb turkey today, made a cheese ball and did all the slicing and dicing for all the other side dishes today, truly a combined effort between my wife and I for our thanksgiving dinner.   Whopper"
4477,Smokey,2006-11-24 01:26:00,1278,Hey Brian. I haven't gotten that far into the books but I'll have to have a look.

4536,ehg,2006-11-24 03:51:00,2666,I'm a chef so i feel comfortable around foodstuff anywhere. Kids and wife like simple food so i'll get it ready fast. Having dates come to my place for a dinner always worked out pretty good as well  ehg
4660,setomonkey,2006-11-24 15:47:00,872,"My wife and I both like to cook, and we probably split it about even. I'm better at some things and dishes and she's better at others. I do almost all the BBQing and she is amazing at sauces.  And you single guys, forget the flash clothes or car, if you really want to impress a date, learn to cook!  My wife still mentions the wild mushroom & rosemary pasta I made for her on our first official date...  Mike"
4675,cityfisher,2006-11-24 16:16:00,959,"i cook for me and my gf most of the time.....i love creating new dishes and playing with ingrediants ... i told her "" i have no problem with cookiing but I AINT CLEANING"" then i spurted out "" thats a womens job"" ( trying to be funny ) ..... she didnt like that much ...lol"
4679,Moosebunk,2006-11-24 16:24:00,3970,"Bren usually manages meals such as pasta, meatloaf, stirfry and such.  I handle the meat, fish and potatoes.  In the end, it's a pretty even split.  We're both shiftworkers."
4681,Britmick,2006-11-24 16:35:00,29,"We spent £££££s on a new kitchen and appliances but the food still came out the same  Angela tends to cook most of the time but I do have a go sometimes, our daughters are dab hands at it.  Mick."
4685,douG,2006-11-24 16:44:00,2693,"BTW for those on the west side of the pond, 'dab hand' could be transliterated as 'exquisite expert'.  Hope this hleps."
4694,Raf,2006-11-24 17:09:00,3495,What is hleps transliterated?
4700,hawkeye,2006-11-24 17:31:00,162,"I do almost all the cooking, why, take Tuesday as an example. Grilled cheese sandwich at 10PM why, was served under cooked ducky at 7:30. No thanks says I, you can't rush fowl it just has to cook until it's truly done. Results wife PO'ed didn't speak the rest of the night  She does try though but her offerings are limited. She makes a bang up borscht. Something she did manage to learn from her native country. And something called meat with mayonnaise. Sounds horrible but really it's not. A layer of onions, a layer of veal, a little mayo on top of that and a layer of cheese, maybe mushrooms too. Into the oven and man what a meal.  Anyway I cook and she cleans up and its been a happy 9 years so who's to complain"
4702,Britmick,2006-11-24 17:38:00,29,"Thank you douG for transliterating for me,   Mick"
4953,Beans,2006-11-25 04:47:00,3339,My mother and father split up when I was young so I had to learn how to cook at an early age...My first wife's step-father graduated from the University of Hong Kong as a chef and I have spent the past fifty years trying to duplicate the flavor he put into Chinese cusine...I come close but not exactly the same...I think it has sumpin' to do with the tonic wine he used...Never got any complaints from Meely or Crappieperchhunter and his wife Debbi  Like most here I have a small library of cooking books (50+) and the first thing I read in magazines or newspapers is the recipes...I usually follow a recipe once then I improvise.  Maribeth is a good cook but since I was first home from work way back when  it was natural for me to do dinner for us...Mike and Motv8tr were with us then...She still does the cleanup...mainly just pots and pans now that we have a dishwasher...
4970,bigwaternut,2006-11-25 13:07:00,5,I always was pretty good at cooking using cook books and recipies from friends etc. Then along came the internet. Check out this site.....it has literally changed our lives. Now I cook like a master chef.  http://www.epicurious.com/  search: 'roasted mushroom soup'....IT'S OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!
