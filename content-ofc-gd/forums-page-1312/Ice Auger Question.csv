5383,Bear,2006-11-27 00:52:00,106,4 stroke ... 4 hp ...... curious  sounds like it may be a heavy rig to carry ariund
5384,Fisherman,2006-11-27 00:54:00,7201,"Strikemaster has a 4 stroke this year, no bigger than the 2 strokes."
5391,2jack2,2006-11-27 01:05:00,92,"I am petty sure there is none out there. I just need to double check. There was one time a lady call and looking for the 4 hp 4 stroke power auger, I told her as far as I know, there is none on the maket. she won't believe me. She said she saw it on TV. She call one of the local Canadian tire and they told her they have it in stock. When I ask her how much was the price, she said $550. I keep telling her for that price, it could be a 3 HP only. There was one unhappy customer because she think I know nothing about ice auger. Wait until she try to pick one up from Canadian tire....."

5410,Fisherman,2006-11-27 02:07:00,7201,"Here's the dealer list, DC Marine in keswick is a close one, the rest: http://www.strikemaster.com/dealers/canada.html"
5416,tjsa,2006-11-27 02:14:00,1578,"I agree fishdawg, CTC only carries jiffy. They did have eskimo at one time, but not now. Strikemasters should be available at other specialty tackle stores. Too bad my jiffy is basically brand new, I would buy the 4 stroke if it weren't for that. I have a feeling more of the few major manufacturers of augers will be offering 4 strokes really soon."
