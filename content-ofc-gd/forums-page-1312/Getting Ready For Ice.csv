5102,dwc67,2006-11-25 22:11:00,140,i made some  creepers for this season. it's ron's design  and they are the best i have seen. thanks for the material bud    i made this wind anchor for my trap to replace the one i lost last year    it ties to your trap/hut and you put the pipe down another hole. when you want it out you pull the rope on the end of the pipe.  
5119,FinS,2006-11-25 23:23:00,463,"i needed this, the anchor tho i fish in 8x8 huts but when the time comes to travel to other lakes this will work out great with my clam 2000 http://www.clamcorp.com/clam_2000.html i enjoy it picked her up for $75 come on ice"
5131,Ron,2006-11-25 23:51:00,1683,So ya got them finally built eh Dave! Kinda spiffy lookin too. Man those things should be good for walking on ice banks too.
5136,Terry,2006-11-26 00:07:00,14456,don't forget to take them off before you walk on the hardwood floor my motorcycle studs weren't that aggressive
5177,jason27fish,2006-11-26 03:10:00,90,good idea
5181,Fisherman,2006-11-26 03:11:00,7201,"Nice work but, have you ever tried to walk in a pair of downhill skiboots? I think you might get the same effect of not being able to bend the sole of your foot.  I think that's why you'll see most commercial made creepers are flexible."
5196,Ron,2006-11-26 04:03:00,1683,Have you ever tried to walk in a pair of steel toed boots? These creepers are about the same.  The reason you see commercial creepers flexible is because they are mass produced and cost effective.
5306,crappieperchhunter,2006-11-26 17:32:00,2582,"Looks like you are getting all geared up for the ice. I buddy of mine has those metal creepers. Alot of the ""Old Rainbow"" fishing guys do. However my friend never wears them anymore because they are too darn heavy. I do alot of ice fishing. A few years ago I got -100C rated boots solely for ice fishing. The only time I wear them is for ice fishing and I never wear boots while I am driving my car.  So I went to Crappy Tire and got 3/8 hex screws and screwed them into the bottom of my boots. This will work on any boots suitable for winter wear. The head of the hex bolts give you more then enough traction. Nothing to strap on ...no extra weight. If you find your new creepers too heavy or a bit of a bother give the hex bolts a try. I'm sold on it.  P.S. I found after 3 seasons some of the heads where getting a little rounded and my ice traction was not as good. Just take em out and screw new ones in.  Bring on the ice."
