I don't know about going after great whites but musky and pike are a blast. Caught 4 muskies this year in the kayak and one of them  knocked my digital camera out of the yak and into the lake. Here's a pic of a 35"" pike I caught last year that turned the yak around twice before I could lay a hand on it. "
