4636,fishnsled,2006-11-24 14:58:00,3520, WOW  Great stuff!!!!!  I think Irishfield has the right idea.  I hope you have lots of room!
4639,ehg,2006-11-24 15:03:00,2666,"Thats an awesome report  People spend many thousands of dollars on boats etc... only hoping to get into fish like that. I'd be very careful about  revealing that location even through PM's  again very amazing,  ehg"
4642,setomonkey,2006-11-24 15:11:00,872,"Congrats, that's an amazing night of fishing. Glad you persevered, and nice to hear that the OFC community was helpful to you in your quest for fish.  Shore fisher unite!  wtg!  Mike"
4645,fishindevil,2006-11-24 15:17:00,6254,WOW....WOW   THATS AMAZING YOU CAUGHT AND RELEASED THAT MANY TROPHYS IN ONE NIGHT THATS AWSOME WAY TO GO.....
4654,Chris,2006-11-24 15:38:00,405,"Real nice, man there's been some big eyes caught in the last week. Congrats"
4663,Moosebunk,2006-11-24 15:55:00,3970,"Ha!!!!  This report is funny.  I'm reading it wondering and waiting who will finally ask.... ""Where were ya fishing???""  Gotta be killing some of yas not to know.  Great report, good night out.  How many pm's are ya up to know???"
4668,ccmtcanada,2006-11-24 16:05:00,7971,"LOL...before today, I had maybe 3 PM's in total.  Since this post from last night, I've had 8.  Some have asked where we were, some have offered trades for info, and some just to say ""great work and DO NOT TELL ANYONE"".  Just so people know, we are not ready to give up this location....it literally took us 6 weeks of fishing about 4 times a week at night....freezing our butts off in rain, wind and even snow.....trying new things....trying new locations....going home empty handed on most nights....buying and trying different lures....logging water conditions, wind speed and direction etc....  The payoff was golden though!!!  It may never happen again to this degree, but at least we had our one great night.  "
4673,Moosebunk,2006-11-24 16:12:00,3970,"8 pm's!!!!! ONLY 8!!!!!  Again, good for you.  You're obviously at an easily accessible spot to anyone.... the shore. lol.  You're thread will reach far and wide posted here.  Give it away once, twice, and there it goes..... snowballing downhill for you everytime you go there afterwards.  Your good hardwork and time paid off for you.     PM sent.     kidding."
4677,snag,2006-11-24 16:21:00,1932,DEFINATELY KEEP IT A SECRET!!    except from me.
4693,1leggedangler,2006-11-24 17:08:00,364,"Congrats to the both of you. Beauty fish to say the least. Good for you for finding that honey hole and most definitely keep it to yourselves. You did the leg work you reap the rewards. All hail the best shore fisherman/woman this site has seen in a while.  Cheers, 1leg"
4701,fishdawg,2006-11-24 17:32:00,912,"well done hold on to that spot,  definetly earned"
4703,Gman,2006-11-24 17:39:00,126,"Solid effort and report,,,well done and CONGRATULATIONS on the pay off  Cheers, Gman"
4705,SHAD,2006-11-24 17:40:00,134," That statement, right there, is what separates you from 95% of the people on this site.  Way to go man, never give up that location!"
4752,snag,2006-11-24 19:33:00,1932," 95%? I'm sure you're not being that literal.  I know for myself and the few members I've met (not to mention all the members who's life/angling experience far dwarf my own dedication) that maybe 20-40% may come close.  Either way,  Kudos guys!!"
4798,Jigger,2006-11-24 21:04:00,1237,Awesome job guys! I'm not going to ask where it was you were fishing. But in no way do I object to being invited to carry the bait bucket on your next excursion  Congrats again!
4844,drufis,2006-11-24 23:44:00,45,"I can't add anything that has not already been said.  Congratulations, great job on what must have been fun night."
4845,Weedman,2006-11-24 23:46:00,32,"Blyte, I owe you an apology.  Note to self......pay closer attention to the people in the pics instead of being consumed by the size of the fish.  I just would've assumed a woman wouldn't be out braving the wind, rain and cold temps like that at this time of year so kudos to you guys as a husband and wife team, you're truly the dynamic duo.  As far as the spot you guys were fishing from, don't even think about disclosing it.  You've worked hard to find it and you deserve to keep it to yourselves for awhile.  Perserverance pays in the end!!!! Congratulations again, you guys have one of this year's best fish stories for sure....."
4851,Golfisher,2006-11-24 23:57:00,586,Simply speechless.
4853,Greencoachdog,2006-11-25 00:23:00,8163,"WoooHoooo! what a night!!! Excellent report and pics!!! I don't care where you were fishin', I want to know what you were usin'??? I see what looks like a perch swimbait in one pic and maybe a pink and white HJ or X-Rap in another? If you don't feel comfortable saying on the board... I understand.  A BIG CONGRATULATIONS to both of y'all!!!"
4865,Bly,2006-11-25 01:05:00,1556," Thanks for the apology....but it wasn't really necessary!  Because of exactly what you said and the layers of clothes, people who see us fishing assume the same thing.  As you may have figured out, I'm not the typical woman...I just love fishing and will go to extremes to get out there.  It's actually a funny joke in our house when I'm all dressed for fishing.  Thank you"
4866,Carp,2006-11-25 01:08:00,1488,Super outing for you.  Make sure you keep checking the rear view mirror on your next trip.
4543,ccmtcanada,2006-11-24 05:33:00,7971," Joining this messageboard and getting great advice and motivation - Free  2 new pairs of warm gloves - $60  Landing 60lbs of Walleye in 3 hours - PRICELESS!!!!!   Blyght and I decided to try a new location and new lures for our fishing tonight.  After landing four 11 pound+ Walleye in the last 6 weeks, we thought our season may be about over.....that is until tonight.....we landed 5 and lost 1...the smallest was a 10 pounder!!!  Take a close look at our NEW coats....LOL...looks like we'll need them washed after tonite!!!!  On the first cast of the night I had a hit...FISH ON!!!!  This one was 11lbs, 30"" long with a 17"" girth.   The following are the rest of the pics.... Blyght caught this one....12.25lbs, 29"" long with a 18.5"" girth   I caught this one.....11.25lbs, 30"" long with a 17.5"" girth   I also caught this guy...10lbs, 28.5"" long with a 16"" girth   Finally...the biggest one of the night....a NEW PERSONAL BEST for Blyght....a huge 14.25lbs, 32"" long with a 20"" girth!!!!!   There were a few key factors that we believe led to our success tonight.....the first is this board!  We were talking about it and although most of our nights yield NO fish, reading all the reports on here motivated us to keep on going out and trying!  The second....and VERY helpful tonight was all the advice on warm gloves.  We needed LOTS of pairs tonight as they kept on getting wet.  We went out and bought a few different kinds to try out and they kept our hands nice and warm on this chilly night...there was frost on the car when we left for the night.  So....THANKS EVERYONE!!!  PS....All fish were caught and successfully released....we want to catch them again next year when they're fatter....hehe"
4546,Joey,2006-11-24 05:41:00,9122,What a great report.  Contgratulations to both of you.  Great pics and great fish.  Joey
4547,bigfish1965,2006-11-24 05:42:00,3382,That is insane!!  Awesome fish. Congrats to blyght. I know some pro's that would kill to catch one like that!!
4549,Weedman,2006-11-24 06:10:00,32,"Ok guys, that is an absolutely awesome night of fishing!!  Without giving too much away, were you guys fishing off shore?   If so, you may also have a record bag of fish from shore.  Blyte's fish could be a record weight for this year.....has anyone else bagged a walleye over 14 lbs?  If so, let us know....we gotta keep track of these large fish and award a prize for the largest live release of the year!!  I'm guessing that a 15 lber is gonna be caught at Quinte before freezeup 'cause the fish just keep getting bigger as the water gets colder.  I can't give away my secret walleye spot on Lake O, but let's just say my buddy Duane and I landed over 150 lbs of walleye in 5 hours of fishing one night many, ok....many, many years ago hotshotting Bomber Long A's in a current area.  We just couldn't miss! Largest was a 34 inch long, 21 inch girth fish that tipped our scales at 16.75 lbs.  I'll never forget it.....Congrats gentlemen, when we're open to learning new tactics, isn't it great when they pay off?.....you guys have raised the bar big time!!!"
4550,ccmtcanada,2006-11-24 06:17:00,7971," Thanks for the great post!!!  We knew we had a great night going, but we had no idea just how big until after reading your post!  We were fishing off shore....we are poor and boatless....hehe.  One thing though...blyght is my wife....LOL.  Here's a picture of her in the summer....without 4 layers of clothes under and oversized coat.....  "
4551,cplummer,2006-11-24 06:46:00,165,WOW..... some real beauty eyes there 4 sure... congrats on a great nights fishin.. cliff..

4567,RangerGuy,2006-11-24 12:31:00,564,AWESOME REPORT!  Those are some real hogs!
4568,SlowPoke,2006-11-24 12:31:00,2984,"Those are monsters! What do you charge for 1/2 day guides? LOL!!!!  P.S. Blyght, your 14lber has apparently eaten my personal best walleye and small mouth bass for breakfast. ""All hail the walleye king and queen!"" -Brian"
4570,Blake,2006-11-24 12:36:00,418,Awesome report and congrats on your PB.  Glad to see they went back for another year.  Kudos to both of you for releasing those great fish.
4573,BITEME,2006-11-24 12:41:00,1969,Very nice fish
4576,Stevejr,2006-11-24 12:43:00,13,"Holy smokes,,,, what an insane night of fishing. 14 lbs thats increadible. What a bonus to be fishing with your wife. Wish mine would join me. I am heading out to Picton to try some action on this Sunday I'll post a report on the action. Hopefully I can better your 14lber, but not likely.  cheers"
4580,mepps,2006-11-24 12:46:00,1301,great job guys!
4584,lunkerbasshunter,2006-11-24 13:10:00,2585,very cool that you released those monters.  Good on you!!!! Nice to see some huge fish being caught form shore as well!  THanks for sharing your report!  Cheers!
4588,Mike the Pike,2006-11-24 13:15:00,3421,now that is quite a fish .well hope to get over 11lbs next year.
4601,irishfield,2006-11-24 13:51:00,26272,And to think we went to BOQ for less. Maybe we need to rethink this Cliff and next November we'll all just bunk in with you two !  What a bunch of monsters!
4604,tonyb,2006-11-24 13:58:00,1637,"Congrats on the phenomenal catch!, and from shore no less!  I hear you on the 'poor and boatless' thing and know first hand what it's like to have many trips with limited success but then have it pay off a few days a year.  The feeling is priceless!  Look forward to more of your 'team' reports.  P.S. I hope you guys can make it out ice-fishing this year, the hardwater allows you access to all those offshore places that are unavailable without a boat normally.  I believe there is going to be at least one OFC get together this winter, hope to see you guys there.  Cheers, Tony"
4608,trapshooter,2006-11-24 14:00:00,1234,Wow!  Serious props to you 2 for an amazing night.  All at a new location too.... think you'll go back?!?!  hahaha.  That 32x20 is a real impressive fish (as are the rest of em).  I'd be going to advanced taxidermy for a replica if I caught that pig.  Thanks for the report.
4609,wuchikubo,2006-11-24 14:01:00,1114,"awesome report Cliff, and congrats to your wife on her PB.  sent you a PM."
4611,The Urban Fisherman,2006-11-24 14:03:00,2050,You two are an inspiration to shore fisherman and women on OFC! haha  you two rock!  UF
4620,Headhunter,2006-11-24 14:26:00,5703,"What, you couldn't find a shore spot that held any big fish!!! Seriously, some really nice fish there! There's a bunch of Quinte guys who are currently hanging around in front of your house, waiting to follow you where ever you go!!! Great report... I'm already losing sleep over it! HH"
