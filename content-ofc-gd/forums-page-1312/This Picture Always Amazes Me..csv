5037,misfish,2006-11-25 17:50:00,29133,Sure some happy faces there Dan. Never seen it before.  Thanks   BTW What are you doing on your sundays now  Atleast I got the bow hunt still.
5085,fishindevil,2006-11-25 21:25:00,6254,WOW....thats a huge monster pike for sure depending on what he used he might even have a world line class record as well and not even know about it......
5143,BabyHerc,2006-11-26 00:35:00,285,That's a fish and a half!
5154,cisco,2006-11-26 01:32:00,597,"Beauty native-caught northern!  Seen it before, but do you notice the marks behind the gill? Looks like a 3 or 4 prong fish spear got it."
5155,Terry,2006-11-26 01:41:00,14456,I can't believe that was 99. I it seems like it was only a year to 2 ago
5158,Rizzo,2006-11-26 02:18:00,4754,"caught in 99, still eating it today!"
5175,jason27fish,2006-11-26 03:09:00,90,big fish
5246,Guest Trophymuskie,2006-11-26 13:57:00,0,"Sure is a huge pike, but 70 inches or 80lbs it's not  LOL. I would guesstimate it at maybe 56 inches and 40 lbs max. Still an unbelievable pike."
5247,Motorhead,2006-11-26 14:02:00,163,"Now I eat alot of fish but not sure how that one would taste  , sure would be fun to catch though  Doug"
