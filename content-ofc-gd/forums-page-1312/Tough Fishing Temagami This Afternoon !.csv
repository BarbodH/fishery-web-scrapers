4116,irishfield,2006-11-23 01:25:00,26272,A pictures says a thousand words!    I'm also now boatless....    I know there was a few here that had interest in my Glastron...but I couldn't pass up saving the tax on the trade value. If anyone has interest PM me...I know what they are going to list it at and of course what they can afford to let it go for.  Wayne
4136,Dano,2006-11-23 01:48:00,719,"Geeeezus Wayne, what the heck? Is that a fuel barrel or what? You didnt waste any time heading up there huh?"
4143,irishfield,2006-11-23 02:01:00,26272,Figured the sun was shinnin and I could run it up without worrying about the cover. Glad I took it up now...already snow on the ground and the lake is STIFF.  That's just an empty barrel..holding the dock anchor chains for the winter.
4214,fishdawg,2006-11-23 07:12:00,912,love the look of that stiff lake!
4220,Roy,2006-11-23 11:22:00,13728,"A fine looking boat, Wayne. I'm sure it was well looked after so it should sell pretty quick."
4221,motv8tr,2006-11-23 11:31:00,2587,"Geez Wayne, how lazy can you be...just break a little of the ice and away ya go  , it's not that thick...sheesh...at least now you can go fishing with Tinbanger if he still has room for one more...  Maureen"
4254,fishindevil,2006-11-23 14:26:00,6254,"wow,frozen already ,you might get to go out there real soon,is the opener on jan1,or can you go out now ,as soon as the ice is safe?????"
4288,irishfield,2006-11-23 16:33:00,26272,"This was just the back bay where the marina is. U could still launch a boat at the town dock and go up the main lake. Ice fishing is ice fishing as far as I know...if the ice is there drill a hole and go, even if it's August! Just watch what is still open etc.  There was ice on most smaller lakes all the way up...and even some ice floating on Midland Harbour when I left yesterday."
