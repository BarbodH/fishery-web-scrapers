5372,007,2006-11-27 00:22:00,537,Just imagine how big they could grow in Lake Simcoe if they weren't all caught and fried before they had chance to mature?? Would be great to catch a few that size - bet they fight well   ?

5409,nautifish,2006-11-27 02:02:00,1416,    Riesige Sitzstange <<<<< Jumbo Perch.  Lived there for seven years there is some great fishing on mainland Europe.
5414,Fisherman,2006-11-27 02:12:00,7201,"I really don't think so, what you have translated works out to a ""large perch"", but the kind of perch that a bird sits on. Like a roost."
5421,nautifish,2006-11-27 02:35:00,1416,  Actually fisherman Jumbo in german they say jumbo They just sound a little different  saying it because they have an accent....Kinda like me......   but if u say Jumbo perch that is how it is translated.  You say jumbo yellow fish it is translated too (  Riesiger gelber Fisch )
