4931,Carp,2006-11-25 04:10:00,1488,"That's a good diet sport 'cause you'll perspire, defecate and urinate yourself on the decent and be lighter by the time you get to the bottom.  I know I probably would.  Crazy kids."
4933,Rizzo,2006-11-25 04:15:00,4754,"what a wuss, I skied that run without a parachute.  Dinged my edges up real bad"
4989,Rich Clemens,2006-11-25 14:49:00,3131,"I recall driving over the apline passes in Switzerland several years ago.  No guide rails, maybe a small concrete post every few meters.  Ya look down over the side of the road and it take you a heck of a long time finally hit bottom if you went over the edge.  Those mountains are truely impressive.  This is definitly on my list of things to NOT DO BEFORE I DIE.  Cool video though."
