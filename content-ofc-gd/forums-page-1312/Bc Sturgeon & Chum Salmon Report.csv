5020,TroutSlayer,2006-11-25 15:58:00,64,Great report KC!  Thanks for posting that! Someday I'll give those fish a try!
4671,K.C.,2006-11-24 16:11:00,14, No we didn't Bunk.  I asked the guide if he has ever tried some and he told me they were not to his liking. Something about the meat being more white then pink and being a little tougher.
4674,Moosebunk,2006-11-24 16:15:00,3970,"So you marinate it to the color, texture and taste you want. lol.  If it's good enough for Capn' Highliner to vaccuum pack, freeze and send all the way to us high society folk here in the Moose, well, it's good enough for you. lol.  EAT IT."
