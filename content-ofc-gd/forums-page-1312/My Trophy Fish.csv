4972,wishn4fishn,2006-11-25 13:37:00,108,"i'll see ur midget bass and raise you a bass fry.  We made cosmo's at a friends cottage, played cards and i was catching minnows using a butterfly net. Together with the minnows this bass was so aggressive it attacked and nipped all the other less worthy fish.  I have another shot of this fry beside a cigg filter, it's incredibly small "
