3874,ccmtcanada,2006-11-22 16:22:00,7971,"Looks like you have to pay for the manual.....here's a link....the Honda website re-directs you to the following page, so it seems legit.  http://www.helminc.com/helm/Result.asp?Sty...UKLWQARGX1N8BR2  Nice ATV btw!!!"
3880,cityfisher,2006-11-22 16:28:00,959,Your not touching it !! lol jk   Thanks !! gonna order it now !
3887,Terry,2006-11-22 16:35:00,14456,here is a good place to buy stuff at their store or online  http://www.royaldistributing.com/   I find these are good for rods rifles and augers http://www.royaldistributing.com/servlet/M...dex_s_04_A.html
3890,Smokey,2006-11-22 16:43:00,1278,"Nice bike. I agree with Terry, Royal usually has some great deal. Your also close enough to run down to Snow City Cycle on Kennedy south of Elesmere for deals on gear. I got my 2 helmets there for 49 buck each on sale. So you could give them a try. I bought an extra key from the dealer and they cut it there. Some might not be able to cut them but can still sell you the blank and then you could take it to a good locksmith shop to have it cut. Avoid the ctc or home depot for cutting unless you want to buy more blanks if they screw it up, sometimes easier to go to a pro right off the bat.  Good Luck with it."
3905,cityfisher,2006-11-22 17:33:00,959, Thanks guys ! im gonna stop by Snow City in a couple mins .... right by my work
3943,walleyejigger,2006-11-22 19:09:00,876,"the first bit of help you NEED is get rid of the honda and get yourself a yamaha   jk. good luck have fun and drive safe, you're gonna have a ball"
3964,carll2,2006-11-22 20:32:00,443,"hey cityfisher nice bike. i had  the 450es for a couple years and have nothing to complain baout it except for one thing in winter when going through water or slush the electric shift seems to screw up.the gears seem to freeze in place,always let it dry out after use in the winter. and for the keys i had to order mine at the honda dealership and go to whereever i wanted to get it cut.   very nice bike"
3969,misfish,2006-11-22 20:51:00,29133,"YELLOW ,SWEET  Nice ride dude."
4023,ecmilley,2006-11-22 22:20:00,2163,"honda is good and reliable, and there is many web boards dedicated to atv alas all I know is the yamaha sites"
4039,tjsa,2006-11-22 23:10:00,1578,Nice ride. Below is a decent atv site.  http://www.atvtime.com/phpBB2/
4153,Dabluz,2006-11-23 02:15:00,701,"You've got a great ATV.  I've got an 88 Yamaha Big Bear.  As to which is the best ATV, that's impossible to answer.  It's like asking which is the best car or pickup.  I suggest you buy a Clymers or Haynes Honda ATV manual at Canadian Tire.  It will only cost about 10 bucks but you will be able to do a lot of your own maintenance.  I know nothing about bikes or ATVs but I have taken apart and rebuilt 2 bikes (78 Honda CB400T and 83 Yamaha Virago 920cc) and my ATV just by using the manuals."
4540,cityfisher,2006-11-24 04:38:00,959,  I ordered a Honda Manual and should be getting it soon.  Looking forward to the hardwater season !
4614,Entropy,2006-11-24 14:14:00,747,Congrats on the new bike....  It will be two years before I can buy one.  What will something similar cost? I need to start squireling away.  Entropy
4621,cityfisher,2006-11-24 14:27:00,959,just over 4 grand... not sure if i got a good deal... but i think so
4626,misfish,2006-11-24 14:35:00,29133,  Thats a great deal cityfisher.  Wonder if cityhunter got the same one
4637,cityfisher,2006-11-24 14:59:00,959, let me ask ....... Yup he does
4653,Dabluz,2006-11-24 15:36:00,701,"If it came fully loaded ""like in the photo"" you got a great deal.  ATVs don't depr√©ciate much.  The 450 Foreman is about the best there is.  The only thing I don't like about the Foreman is the fact that you have to put it in neutral before putting it in reverse.  It slows down tasks like plowing snow."
4669,cityfisher,2006-11-24 16:10:00,959," Yup thats the actual ATV. I gotta take a good pic when i take it out for the first time .... came with front and rear bumpers, windshield,winch,2upseat/storage, almost brand new mud bug 25' tires and the front brakes & front wheel bearing were just changed."
5337,carll2,2006-11-26 20:58:00,443,"great deal same prices over here in quebec,, i bought mine lasy year fully loaded for 4600$ with 5k on it..one thing i love about honda is they keep thier value compared to other  kinds"
