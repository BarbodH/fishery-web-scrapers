5040,misfish,2006-11-25 17:56:00,29133," Yes they are open all year,but as far as a no limits  .Check the regs in the area you are fishing.  Easy fishing on Simcoe from shore up here in Barrie.50 for sport, and 25 is the con."
5074,xrap,2006-11-25 20:49:00,683,open all year and no limit  Exception- Lake Couchichingand lake simcoe tributaries
5089,irishfield,2006-11-25 21:38:00,26272,"This is why it's critical to get your own copy of the regs and read it fully before heading out on any body of water. Like Misfish said...read the regs.  Xrap is correct for Division 4 that you are planning to fish, but for other outings/people reading this thread... Limits apply many places other than Couch and Simcoe.  Divisions # 1/2/5/16/17/20/21/22/22A/24/27(Nippissing -where there is also a season!)/28/30/31/32/33/34 all have limits on Perch"

5293,setomonkey,2006-11-26 16:58:00,872," You can get them online, or pick up a copy the next time you are at a tackle store. I always check them before heading out to a new body of water, and it's handy to have with you as well, either on the boat or at your cottage or ...  Happy fishing, Mike"

5389,Rattletrap2,2006-11-27 01:04:00,1652,"Just curious....I was at that exact spot today....Hwy #89 and Hwy #10....Shelburne area. For the life of me, I can't figure out where you would go to catch Perch in that area. Trout perhaps, I saw lots of parked cars and trucks that were probably doing just that, but Perch is another thing altogether."
5393,pidge,2006-11-27 01:20:00,438,"Sorry about that, but I ment 10 and 9 not 89. Made it up to Luther Marsh for the day, but got skunked. All ice around the shore except by the damm. Oh well. Thanks to everyone who replied."
