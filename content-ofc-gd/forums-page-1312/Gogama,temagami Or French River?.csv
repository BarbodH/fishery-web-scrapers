Looking for a new spring destination for some good pike fishing. we have done the Port Loring area many times and Red Cedar Lake last year. I personally am leaning towards the Gogama area but would like to hear some additional opinions. I know Lake Simcoe is good and close to home but we like to get up north for this trip. Any opinions and advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
5148,Spiel,2006-11-26 00:51:00,9065,....Personally I think you'll do better numbers wise in the Gogama/Gowganda area. Of the areas you've mentioned it would be my first choice for pike action .
5151,BUSTER,2006-11-26 01:24:00,1336,go north
5284,walleyejigger,2006-11-26 16:13:00,876,"if you plan it right (may long weekend) the gogama area is great for shallow water pike fishing, fishing them by sight is a rush, and of course the opener of walleye season,  ps never too early to start planning"
5286,woodro,2006-11-26 16:18:00,168,"those spots are all good if you know what your doing, personally i think the further north you go the easier the fishing may become (most of the time) How did you like red cedar camp nesr temagami? i was thinking about going there with my father last year for smallies"
5302,BabyHerc,2006-11-26 17:21:00,285,How about Manitoba near The Pas?  70lb Pike: can't go wrong there!
5304,Clampet,2006-11-26 17:29:00,1947,Gogama for size and numbers. Lake Nipissing for budget minded.

5347,express168,2006-11-26 21:43:00,327,"woodro, in all fairness to Red Cedar Lake Camp the weather was so terrible last May 24 that we truly didn't get to appreciate the fishing and the camp. For the price the cottages were alright and there is alot of area to fish on Red Cedar Lake. I am not too sure about the Smallmouth fishing as all we targeted were pike that weekend."
5433,Bing,2006-11-27 03:31:00,33,"I've been fishing the last week of June at Minekwa Lodge in Gogama, with 12 guys and we always catch are limit of pickeral halfway through the week.  We also had a lot of bass action, I expect to keep going back for several years. They have lots of dock room as well."
