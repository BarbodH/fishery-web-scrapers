4969,Greencoachdog,2006-11-25 12:59:00,8163,"There ya go Phil! That looks a little better, almost gives it a little ""scale"". How big was that little booger? Did you have a curly tail on that jig?  I'm fixin' to head to the river in a few mins. for a little fishin' time, they aren't ""pullin"" water like they were last week, so I don't expect much... but ya never know 'til ya go!  S'posed to be 72 here today with light wind.. may get off a couple ""nudie"" shots!!!"

5365,Whopper,2006-11-26 23:53:00,2174,"Thanks guys.  Glen I was fishing for saugeye when I caught that cat. Caught nine small saugeyes when it hit I though I had big bertha, the cat fought hard in the current. I caught on a 1/4 ounce jig and chartruse curly tails that was garlic scented. It probably weighed between 2 1/2 to 3lbs.  Whopper"
