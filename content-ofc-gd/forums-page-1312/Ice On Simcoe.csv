Had to launch through it, not too bad though. It won't be long now. The fishing was pretty good, we were going to fish out of Pefferlaw but there were no other boats there and we forgot our fishfinder. No way we were going to try and find them without it... We went into the Bay South of Georgina near the Ferry run and right away got into some really nice sized Perch. Between the two of us, we brought home about 80 or 90 nice sized Perch. Sorry, I only took one pic of the boat when we were launching and then forgot all about pics once I started to fish. LOL "

It was an awesome day. Wanted to go again yesterday but the motor was having some trouble on the way in (99 Evinrude Ficht 150, need I say more) so we decided to play it safe."
