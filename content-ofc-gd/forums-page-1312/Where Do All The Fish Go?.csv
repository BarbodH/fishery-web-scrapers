The Islands is full of fish  - bass, carp, pumpkinseedfish, perch, pike, bullhead, etc during spring, summer and fall    but at this time of the year they all disappear   .  Now I understand that they look for warmer deeper water but does that mean deeper water in and around the islands or do they all move out of the islands completely and head really deep into Lake Ontario?  Oh and what do they do down there? Do warm water fish like bass and carp keep eating down in the depths or do they just 'chill out' till spring??  007"

Drinkin' Zebra Mussel ""Shine"", smokin Hydrilla, talkin' trash to all the ""babe"" fishes, and laughin' at the guy fishin' in the shallows for them."
