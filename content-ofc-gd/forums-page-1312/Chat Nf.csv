4909,tjsa,2006-11-25 03:35:00,1578,"the thing about the chat room now, is that when someone enters it, you don't know unless you check every minute. It used to be, that when someone entered, and you had your sound up, you would get a sound message saying someone has entered the room. That does not happen now with the new chat room, so I missed you by about 1 minute nautifish. Stay there for a bit, to see who shows up, you may be amazed. AND, for a long time now, 2 yrs anyways, tuesday nights around 8:30 pm, is a general meeting time for a bunch of us ""irregulars"" lol."
