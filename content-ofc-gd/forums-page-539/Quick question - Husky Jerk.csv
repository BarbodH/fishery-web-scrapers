582820,Roy,2011-05-14 17:10:00,13728,Take what you'll be comfortable to cast with cause all those sizes will work.
582821,ckrb2007,2011-05-14 17:20:00,449,I agree with Roy......all of those will work. Don't forget a few spinners as well. They'll cast a good ways and are great for gaters.

582825,Garry2Rs,2011-05-14 17:33:00,1425,"If you haven't figured it out yet, the number of Rapala baits is the length in millimetres.  The real question is, what weight will your rod cast best?  Again, you're probably aware of this, but there is a decal on your rod that will tell you what weight baits will work best. Garry2R's"

582832,bassjnkie,2011-05-14 17:42:00,1101,Have to agree with garry. Check the lure weight on the rod(s)and match it up. If you go heavier than stated you will actually lose distance.
582837,crossover,2011-05-14 17:57:00,172,"1/8 - 1/2 oz, meaning any size will do. Will probably go for a couple of 12s and 14s (I'm buying online since cheaper, don't have a car lol)"
582840,craigdritchie,2011-05-14 18:06:00,1586,Adult pike regularly eat baitfish the size of a shoe. Any size will work.
582841,Garry2Rs,2011-05-14 18:11:00,1425," Yes Centimetres...sorry, I'm an old throw back to Imperial measurement and I'm easily confused by all these foreign words."

582875,Dozer,2011-05-14 20:10:00,896,X2 on the pliers post.  Triple treble hooks sometimes get real messy.
