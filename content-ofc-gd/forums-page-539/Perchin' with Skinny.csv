583001,danbouck,2011-05-15 01:58:00,4380,Met up with Tim (Skinny) at the boathouse this morning for some perch and pike fishing. After spending an hour loading up his tackle   we were on our way to the perching grounds.  It's nice to see that the water level seems good this year    The bite started out with only the babies coming out to play but after a bit Tim hooked into the first healthy 12 incher.    I was only managing small ones for a while but it started to pick up and the size was increasing throughout the morning        Love the colours on this one      After we ran out of minnows we went in search of some pike. I ended up losing one boatside   and we had numerous follows but failed to get one in the boat.  Ended up catching around 100 perch and a few OOS smallies and largies. So all in all a good day

583019,skinny,2011-05-15 02:33:00,442,oh thanks a ton for the day I had a great time.  Sorry for the pile of Tackle I over do it and in the end didn't use very much of it for sure. I need to figure out how to loose the blue box I use but it holds my  spinner/buzz bait boxes. I just remembered I still have a bird nest to pull out too  some of those following pike were nice looking fish for sure
