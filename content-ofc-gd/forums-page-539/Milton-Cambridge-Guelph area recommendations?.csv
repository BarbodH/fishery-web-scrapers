583122,pics,2011-05-15 11:46:00,1268,"Conservation areas were often created to manage water levels after Hurricane Hazel. They then created a monster by offering more and more ammenities. The Government then told them they were going to fund just the water management part of it. THAT'S how they come up with the charge to get in!!! I guess in Quebec our tax dollars make everything seem free..."" user pay "" is here!! I hate the high fees as well..."
583140,Roy,2011-05-15 12:42:00,13728,"Some people might find this mildly entertaining. I just see it as a minor annoyance....it's bug season, what can I say. So, crushdem, go bore people on your home board if they'll still have you.  And just so we're clear on things, you'll never qualify for a man card."

583242,GreenCanada,2011-05-15 16:47:00,375," I had given some tips on the lakes/areas in question after scouring the Guelph area for great locales and even giving some of my general ""spots"" away to be kind.  I felt they should be deleted after reading your following posts."
583246,GreenCanada,2011-05-15 16:59:00,375," Let me know when you're drinking on the water so I can stay clear...  I was genuinely surprised by this particular post, because it went from a thread I was happy to contribute to, to one I'm not sure if I should stay a part of.  The conservation fees, laws, and fishing licences are designed to help protect the environment and allow for continued investment in our fisheries so we may continue to enjoy them. The heavily populated GTA might require slightly higher fees to help moderate the overuse of the land. It is a supply and demand industry and having too high a demand might cripple the resource to the part where it may collapse. It is unfortunate to hear that in the Ottawa/Hull area you never heard of a fishing licence, could drink and drive (a boat), never heard of a ""conservation area"", among other things.  I'm still shaking my head at that post...  Not surprised Sun News (aka Fox ""News"" North) is in the background..."
583257,rdjrowley,2011-05-15 17:27:00,13,"They have not STOCKED KELSO in (20) years. The guy who is in charge of conservation Halton. is fat fat slob who only goes to free lunches paid by people who pay very high prices for no services at these parks. If the sportsman club did not put rainbow trout in the Milton pond each year the kids wpuld not have any local fishing in Milton. The Chairman, Mr. g. Carr and the Mayor Mr. G. Grants are out of touch and only interested in what brings in the money like the ski hills."

583277,crossover,2011-05-15 18:01:00,172, lol
583278,Oggie,2011-05-15 18:05:00,588,I'd say go back to Ottawa! Dan O. PS. I grew up in the West End of the Valley and we had more laws than you do in Ottawa???? Go figure?
583279,Roy,2011-05-15 18:08:00,13728," On April 28th you said that Kelso had not been stocked in 10 years. Which is it? You might have a problem with authority figures, especially the heavier ones."
582911,Crush,2011-05-14 22:43:00,13,"Hey guys,  I was wondering about Kelso Lake, Guelph Lake and Puslinch lake and area. It's fairly close to where we live. 45 min away from us in Mississauga.  There is a $6.25 per adult entrance fee (I'm VERY much biting my tongue right now) and I have no idea how much boat rental costs.  If I fish from the shore, I don't want to catch tiny sunfish. I'd like to catch something fun and have no idea what's in the lake as the conservation websites say that all the lakes have all the fish God created and they aren't very helpful.  Also I can't seem to find user info for these conservation areas. Even my backpack map doesn't list these lakes or describe what's available.  I'm curious about boat rental fees also. I'm willing to pay if it's 'worth it' and would like to know what you guys would recommend?"
582912,muskymike,2011-05-14 22:44:00,772,Here we go again!!!
582913,Crush,2011-05-14 22:48:00,13, Here what goes again?
582916,BUSTER,2011-05-14 22:57:00,1336,"Belwood is 70 for 4hrs and 115 for 8hrs 14ft tin and yammy 8hp 4stroke  , pike,bass,perch,catfish...  Guelph lake has a few area's you can launch a tin or canoe but no gas motors. "
582917,Crush,2011-05-14 22:59:00,13, For Belwood would you recommend off shore fishing as the boat prices seem 'insane'.
582926,misfish,2011-05-14 23:09:00,29133,"Im going back to,what are you listening to now.  As for your Kelso ?. I fished the dam 30 years ago. Both top and bottom ,even a mile or so stretch further south. Caught browns and rainbows.   Bellwood, the same pretty much as kelso."

582935,Crush,2011-05-14 23:20:00,13," Hey thanks.  I actually have Sun News on in the background. Great news TV station. Excellent channel.  But yeah I guess I'll have to go and pay and see for myself as there's so little info available. Who knows, there could be a CRAZY amount of fish, fully stalked, but no one go's because of the fee's."
582943,danbouck,2011-05-14 23:31:00,4380,There is a lot of info online about each lake including fees.
582945,pics,2011-05-14 23:36:00,1268,I believe they stock Kelso... Christie Conservation area near Dundas has stocked trout ponds but it's a bit pricy to get in....
582946,Crush,2011-05-14 23:45:00,13," There's info about entrance fees sure.  But not where to fish, or what the lakes offer as far as fishing goes or where to fish."
582948,muskymike,2011-05-14 23:47:00,772," Yes, and when someone finds this information, please pass the information on to me on where to fish on Georgian Bay..."

582974,F7Firecat,2011-05-15 01:05:00,347,"gotta pay to play, please add me on the email list regarding GB also...."
582982,irishfield,2011-05-15 01:20:00,26272,$6.25?? That's only $3.13 per line !
583006,Crush,2011-05-15 02:09:00,13," I'm from Ottawa. I've never heard of a fishing license, let alone a 'conservation area' until coming here to the GTA and am amazed at big brother police state in Ontario here.  Where I'm from, you could smoke in restaurants, smoke and drink in a boat, park your boat where you want, even have airplanes parked out in the water out in constance bay.  Now, we're at a point where you can't use lawn pesticide, have to have a license for your pet, fishing, boating, hunting, etc etc. You can't talk on a cell phone in your car. You can't do ANYTHING anymore. We really have become a police state in these last 7-8 years.  I have to say that as a tax payer and Canadian, I am VERY offended to get charged $6.25 fee to be able to use land that is my own. I never, ever saw this until coming to the GTA. In Ottawa we never had these rules. Ottawa/Hull area is where I'm from and learned where to fish. Lots of stories from back home. Ottawa river right by the Parliament buildings.  Here's what I'll do. I'll go explore these pay 'conservation areas' myself and report my findings. I'll speak to the anglers myself and find how the fishing is, how much the boats cost, etc.  I'll check out the alchohol laws and see what is allowed and what isn't. In Ottawa you just didn't think about this stuff cause it wasn't a police state. But things have gotten so out of control now to the point they might search my car, place me under arrest and put me into holdings. Who knows! Put handcuffs on me and tie me to the truck and drag me to get some giggles.  As soon as the weather is good to go out I'll be report back my findings and am going to start with lake Kelso in Milton. Very close and right off the 401 for everyone to get to."
583009,irishfield,2011-05-15 02:16:00,26272,"I'm sorry.. but Ottawa has the same rules. Fishing licences in Ontario have been around for a VERY long time now. Alchohol in public.. maybe it's just a ""valley"" thing to think that's okay.. it's not legal anywhere in Ontario. (BTW.. I grew up in Sin City.. if you don't know where that is you're not really from Ottawa!)  Oh.. I almost forgot.. airplanes on Constance Lake.. legal and a federal right to everyone in Canada. The Province/Townships/Cities/Towns have no constitutional capacity to access any planning power over aviation. I can even say I've enjoyed that aerodrome!"
583014,danbouck,2011-05-15 02:22:00,4380,There is a difference between crown land and a conservation area

583027,Grimace,2011-05-15 02:54:00,2020,"Sounds like you might work for sun news.  I understand your sentiment but at the same time I have this awful feeling that your trying to insult the intelligence of the average guy here.  Of course you have heard of fishing licenses and drinking in boats is off side.  Are you really trying to get Info on Kelso or Belwood?  Or are you scolding the horrible society that we have created.  Go fish the lakes. Use your knowledge to dissect them and keep your information to yourself.  And if you feel you must lecture the Toronto people on ""way of life issues"" , keep it to yourself.  You don't want the granny state (neither do I ).  So why do you want ""Granny"" to tell you where to fish and how?   Grow a set and earn it."
583029,BillM,2011-05-15 02:57:00,17367,Never heard of a fishing license?  Interesting..
583040,muskymike,2011-05-15 03:07:00,772," Being from Ottawa has nothing to do with you trolling   This is the funniest comment I have ever heard. You didnt really think of it before you wrote it though. I have 4 ""Conservation Areas"" withing 5 kms of my house. I live 45 mins from downtown Ottawa. Ottawa must also not be in Ontario? Which Ottawa are you from? Ottawa PEI?   Oh, you must have just come from 1963. Welcome to 2011. Again, you have succeeding in making me laugh. I have been in Constance Bay 8 times so far this year, not once have I seen a float plane. Yes, as Wayne said, there are 2 guys on Constance Lake that have planes, but not many in the Bay on the River. I have a friend who lives a few mins from Fitzroy, I'll let him know to keep an eye out for you.   I grew up in Stoney Creek. Near Hamilton. Dafasco and Stelco are there. Right by Burlington Street. Lots of stories too. I have never learned where to fish though. I learned how to fish. Every time I am out I learn somewhere else to fish.  I dont even know why I wasted my time giving in to you, but I did. I typed to much already to just cancel it. So I am posting.  It would be nice if a mod would just lock this. This guys posts are comical, I know there will be more. So just lock this one and let him start another"
