582819,Lunatic,2011-05-14 17:08:00,536,"cool, i always wondered what happens when they get hit by lightning."
582847,cranks bait,2011-05-14 18:24:00,721,"A friend of mine flying to Victoria about a month ago was in a plane that was struck by lightning.  She said it was a huge bang, very loud.  No turbulance or anything.  She said other than the BANG you'd never know.  When they got off the plane they look and the front of it was all black where it had hit."
582849,craigdritchie,2011-05-14 18:29:00,1586,"It's not terribly unusual for jets to get hit by lightning. But pilots generally avoid thunderstorms at all costs .... lots of wild turbulence, convective air and wind shear .... makes for a rough ride at best."
582850,irishfield,2011-05-14 18:29:00,26272,"Had ""St Elmos fire"" on the left wing tip of my old Cessna 182 over scugog island in 1995.. that's a flight I'll never forget. That and finding, then landing on the strip on the island in a terrential downpour. Holding the airplane off just above the strip because the water was about 5 inches deep on the grass runway. Landed and stopped with about 50 feet left before I would have hit the barn wall (that we couldn't see until the last minute)!"
