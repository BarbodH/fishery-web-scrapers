583805,BFSC Kevin,2011-05-16 21:40:00,1351,I just drove by AV fishing tackle on Sheppard this morning and I think I saw a FOR SALE/RENT sign. Is it really closed? Anyone know if they relocated or what happened?

583808,BFSC Kevin,2011-05-16 21:44:00,1351,OHH!.. thanks for the info. I guess rent is cheaper or they bought the new location instead.
