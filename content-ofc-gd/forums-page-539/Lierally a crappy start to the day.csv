So this means I'm up with our 6 month old baby girl by 530am, no worries, well, until I go to give her a morning change.  She's wearing some tights underneath a one piece pull over sleeper, Daddys favorite outfit on her, looks like the ultimate snuggie.  Then I go to pull of her tights and pull a little too hard, it smacks me in the face/mouth. Then it hit it, literally.  She soaked through with a massive runny poop.  Just great:clapping:"
