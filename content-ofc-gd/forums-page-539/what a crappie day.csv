Moved down stream to a reservoir that i fish a lot.... targeted pike.... lost one and then no more hits.  Decided to target some panfish..... the crappies were on fire.... a LOT OF SMALL ones... and plenty of gills to be had.... I had the place all to myself all day....  Kept these ones for an afternoon snack    Fishing the windy shores was a little tough.. but worth the effort..... net time I will go earlier."

583588,splashhopper,2011-05-16 13:25:00,2931,"I don't know what the temp was, but when I reached down a foot in to the reservoir to retrieve a lure I snagged up, the water was Warmer than the air I was standing in. Maybe I will get a portable thermometer??  I wonder if they have one that can be used when fishing from shore though?"

583668,Beans,2011-05-16 16:23:00,3339, Two of my fishing partners would disagree...they both prefer bluegills over crappie...  Nice catch Ron...
