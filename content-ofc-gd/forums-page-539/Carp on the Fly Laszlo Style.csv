I only had 30 minutes to spare before I had to get ready for work so I had to move fast. As I approach the river I see 3 Carp feeding. First cast into a mud cloud and...fish on!!!      Got him on a black/orange egg sucking leech.  Fidel...This carps for you buddy."

582661,shane,2011-05-14 00:24:00,652,"Nice one!  Man, you carp/fly guys are killing me. I've been trying to catch a carp on a fly for two years now with no luck. Maybe this year."
582674,highdrifter,2011-05-14 01:02:00,2534,Gross me out greeners..
582737,iCarp,2011-05-14 09:51:00,50,"Great photos, Laszlo.  You're fortunate to have it all nearby- deer, river, carp.  What a great way to start the day before heading off to work."
582783,laszlo,2011-05-14 13:11:00,487,"Thanks guys.  Most anglers hate on carp. I myself can't sit still long enough to fish for them the traditional style but on the fly set up, the action is fast and you see the takes. They're decent fighters too.  Don't get me wrong though...if there were trout directly behind my place...I'd be after them."
582796,The Urban Fisherman,2011-05-14 14:00:00,2050,Well it's nice to see some of you hardcore steelhead boys put slammin carp on the fly! Good work dude
582929,MJL,2011-05-14 23:12:00,2427,Nicely done Laz...Great pics  Shouldn't be too long now till I break out the carp gear
583349,ehg,2011-05-15 22:04:00,2666," Walking out into your yard in T.O and seeing a deer is cool. Have seen coyotes around Humber Bay parks, n clear view of CN tower and Gardiner expressway at same time.  Catching carp on fly rod must be a tussle."
