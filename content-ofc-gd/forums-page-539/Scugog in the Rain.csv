583442,Homer Is King,2011-05-16 01:01:00,305,"There was a break in the rain on Saturday so all 6 of us headed out to our favorite pan fish spot on Scugog. I didn't know what to expect since it was walleye opener. The boat launch and parking was full but not crazy. There were a few other people shore fishing but we didn't see any fish. We got the lines set up and started fishing. It was cold, windy, and it was still spitting. We were under dressed and I didn't think the kids (or the wife) would last long.    We fished for about 10 minutes in light rain with no action. The ""can we go now"" starting and I know I couldn't force this one. I had just started to pack up when my 3 year old yells out and pulls in this guy!    Shortly after that my 5 year old pulls in this fish - awesome colours!    The action then picked up but so did the rain. It really started to come down!      The biggest (longest) of the day!    We were soaked to the bone but I still had to drag them off the dock! We only got to fish for about 20 minutes but it's good to know our spot is starting to produce now. We're already planning our next trip!"

583446,Michael_Brown,2011-05-16 01:05:00,411,Nice report. Love to see families out fishing together.
583453,fishindude,2011-05-16 01:19:00,220,Great to see the little ones persevere through that! Good on ya and thanks for sharing
583455,ehg,2011-05-16 01:27:00,2666,That's the best! My daughter still talks about her first panfish trips years ago. They will always remember that day fondly. Cheers!
583463,BillsTheBassMan,2011-05-16 01:41:00,932,"Way to soldier it out through the rain and give the girls a day they'll remember for a long time!  I'll be on Scugog for the long weekend . . . looking forward to it.  Cheers, Ryan"
583560,Homer Is King,2011-05-16 13:02:00,305,Thanks guys!  It's always a blast fishing with the kids.  Their pure excitement is contagious.  They remind me of what fishing is really all about.
583564,Harrison,2011-05-16 13:07:00,2202,"Homer, I see you are in to B-Town too.  If you see a dashingly handsome man with 2 lil girls fishing that spot or areas around B-town, tell him I want my kids back.  Seiously, I am out with my girls all this time, they are 5 and 2.  Say hi.  Cheers Phil"
583572,Afraz,2011-05-16 13:12:00,250, X 2  Also its cool how those panfish look so huge when a kid is holding em up lol..
583586,The Urban Fisherman,2011-05-16 13:24:00,2050,"awesome! I love the fact that they're slammin' pannies in the rain!  Troopers them kids are!  Very cute...love the reports with the little ones.  Cheers, Ryan"
583652,oldphart,2011-05-16 15:36:00,665,"~~~Darn it all, your kids stole all my phish, I was hoping to be there next weekend but they caught all the phish in the lake, Drat"
583710,Homer Is King,2011-05-16 18:04:00,305,"Sounds good Harrison, I'll keep my eyes open!  It true!!  I figure it's a ratio thing.  If my 3 year old (2 ft tall) catches a 7"" sunfish it's the same as me catch a 25"" fish!!  Inch for Inch her bluegil is a MONSTER!  Don't worry Oldphart! Lots 'o pannies left in the bog!  LOL!"
