Also Just wondering is the gold version worth getting or should I just get a map card?  Thanks

If I understand the info I've read so far correctly, it appears that the DSI models are only good up to a depth of 200 feet which if true, automatically disqualifies them.  Until I read that I was seriously looking at the Mark 5x DSI for $320.  I'm not sure what route to take now but am open to recommendations in that price range."
