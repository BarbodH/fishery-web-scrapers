583388,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-15 23:18:00,10439,Dragged the boat out today and checked out the fit of the new kicker (thanks to HTHM adn Solopaddler for getting it and shippping it out to me) and I installed the new Minn Kota bow mount I picked up last summer for a song. Even better is I have someone that wants to buy my old TM for what I paid for the new one. The main use od the little Merc is going to be on my inflatable but will do double duty on my big boat until I repower the boat in 2013.  The new motors look good.            Now I just need this to go away.
