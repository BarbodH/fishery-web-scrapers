582983,aplumma,2011-05-15 01:25:00,6896,"If your engine is made to run on 87 then run 87 it does not have less cleaners than the higher octane. Some of the higher octane does not have the ethanol but it depends on the brand. I have 138 gallons of fuel in my assorted boats at any given time and use sta-bil marine in all of them with no alcohol issues. I will also use seafoam on the first gas tank in the spring and every 5th fillup. One of the boats lives at the marina and the others are stored in a garage. I would rather spend the money treating the fuel correctly to keep me from expensive repairs. I have torn down carb's in boats,motorcycles and cars and their is a difference the ones that are maintained and those that are not. Also if you decide to switch from ethanol treated gas to non ethanol gas do not mix them they will gum up the carb's from chemical reaction (phase separation)  and you will get a orange gel that will clog the filters and orifices.

Irish is it fine to drain it before I leave...just wanted to do it so I can find the right washer to put into it once I'm home...1h tops.  As for the metal in the oil or milky color...i wont be happy if i see that lol. Got the prop off today with GoneFishin over here and saw a nice 5mm ball of mono under the prop...good thing we did it, nice to get that out...lot's of sand behind the prop too...cleaned it out with toothbrush tho."
582995,MCTFisher9120,2011-05-15 01:51:00,3761,"O, going to try and find another shear pin too I think...any other ""backup"" parts I should look at?"
583000,dave524,2011-05-15 01:57:00,4508," Exactly  if your are making a mess, you're doing it wrong, you don't need any fancy pumps or fill nozzles if you buy it in a tube. I might add you do this with the engine perfectly vertical"
583011,irishfield,2011-05-15 02:19:00,26272,  You can let it drain all week if you want Mike.
583075,Sinker,2011-05-15 03:43:00,8692,"Shell V-power has no ethanol...........yet!  You can run any gas in it you want, just make sure to use a good stabilizer in it,  ALWAYS. Seafoam works great for me. I put a few ounces in each tank for maintenance/stabilizer, and run about a half can spring and fall to decarb the engine and clean the fuel system.  Fill from the bottom, put top screw in first, remove oil from bottom hole and put screw back in quick. No mess. Takes about 4 minutes.  Measuring how much comes out is not a good idea if it is low already, Glen. Fill it till its full and call it done.  Mike, 20ml of oil per litre of gas. Don't over mix it, it doesn't need more oil.    S."
583109,MCTFisher9120,2011-05-15 11:01:00,3761,"So by your number Sinker 360ml of oil goes into my 5 gallon tank. Is it bad to mix oil in my 5gal and 1gal jugs and just keep it up at the tents...could be a week before it get's touched. I'll have the sea foam stuff in them. Or is it best to keep the mixing in the metal gas tank I have down in the boat. Sorry, silly questions."
583144,Jer,2011-05-15 12:55:00,1426,"   There may be others, but both Shell & Ultramar premium grade are ethanol free."
583182,Sinker,2011-05-15 14:55:00,8692,"  I fill/mix mine right in the tank. If I put in 10 litres, I add 200ml of oil.  If your mixing a full, 25l tank, you will need 500ml of oil. Forget about gallons.  Just remember, 20ml of oil, for every litre of gas, and your good to go.  ALWAYS use stabilizer of some sort, trust me. Ask me how I know that??  S."
583264,Muskieman,2011-05-15 17:38:00,2472," No ,I'm not doing it wrong....  I always make a mess no matter what I do..  painting, staining, spaghetti sauces... oil changes  Man.. even when I drink beer.  Randy "
583315,MCTFisher9120,2011-05-15 20:26:00,3761,"Well guys I did it all today. Got the Nautilus oil and did the change. Followed the steps you all gave me and ended up 380ml taken from the bottom.... split a little and lost a little...the oil that came out was clean and had no metal in it. replaced washers and gently tapped screws in with hammer while turning it...turned the motor on it`s sides and up and down once or twice and it doesn`t leak a drop. Well see better when I run it in a little while. Took a picture of the work station. Dad had to sand the prop a little and re paint it haha..same with the hood. he did a great job, looks like a awesome motor.  Thanks for the advice, it really was as easy as it get`s. Get the little pump thing..it helped out.  MTBF"
583328,irishfield,2011-05-15 21:00:00,26272,"Great stuff Mike... ready to go. Now for next time.. the tapping of the screws is only when they're coming out if they are so tight you can't get them to loosen. Stop tapping as soon as they turn! No need for tapping going back in.. just snug them good by turning the screw driver, otherwise you'll end up stripping those delicate aluminum threads."
583346,MCTFisher9120,2011-05-15 21:50:00,3761,"I did it both ways irish. I didn't crank it too hard, the lines are lined up almost as they were before. Was sure to be careful.  Just need to get the fuel additive and fuel line and I'm golden."
583416,HTHM,2011-05-16 00:09:00,4082,"Did you do the impeller too? I am glad it has a good home, I was kinda sad to see it go, but it should give you years of service. As for the mono behind the prop......Someone else used it last.....Apparently he has his ups and downs I think the oil you drained had 7 hours of service on it."
583419,dhickey,2011-05-16 00:15:00,1038,ARE the geese flying south 2day???  ENOUGH all ready.!
583438,MCTFisher9120,2011-05-16 00:54:00,3761, No didn't do the impeller. Only if it's needed to be done I'll get it done. Something to do this fall after I run it good. Obviously if the water doesn't pour out nicely I'll get it replaced but if she runs good and strong then I'll put it off until end of August...a very pricey replacement so hopefully after a test run the part will be fine for use.
582879,MCTFisher9120,2011-05-14 20:24:00,3761,"Hey OFC, I got a 7.5hp Evinrude 2-stroke short shaft. Just asking what to look for at canadian tire for a change of the lower unit oil. I picked up Quicksilver oil for the gas/oil mix. Just want to know what to get for the LU and what size container to get would be helpful.  Thanks guys,  MTBF"

582898,Roy,2011-05-14 21:51:00,13728,"Yes and if you can spare an extra coupla bucks get the screw-in nozzle kit. You'll save yourself a big mess. Make sure you check the washers for wear and replace if needed. Use a LARGE flat head screwdriver for the screws...and as Wayne would say, if you can hide it in your shirt, it's too small."
582902,MCTFisher9120,2011-05-14 22:04:00,3761,"Good advice, another trip to cdn tire is in motion tomorrow then. I'll look for a large one then as well as the little pump thing. Not doing it myself, my friend is going to help me do that before I go out to Leeds & Thousand Islands...well run it once before too to make sure everything is sealed up good and runs ok. If I get a gas line this week I'll give it a test run in the yard"
582906,misfish,2011-05-14 22:17:00,29133, Cant go wrong or better Milo.
582907,Muskieman,2011-05-14 22:31:00,2472,Castrol EP90 part #0152-39... and as Roy stated... get the 15.00$ refill hose kit and avoid the mess.  *edit.  get a can of SEAFOAM for good measure  put about 1/2 in the gas tank.
582910,MCTFisher9120,2011-05-14 22:37:00,3761, I read about sea foam...why use it what does it clean and do? I'm not going to complain or steer away from 15bucks that makes things run smoother...just foolish
582918,misfish,2011-05-14 23:01:00,29133,"  Were talking a 7 an a half here Roy  . It,s a simple task. Remove like said, the top and bottom screws, with a ""LARGE FLAT HEAD ""driver. Let drain. When you want to fill,push the lube into the bottom hole. Once it,s coming out the upper hole,plug the bottom with the screw and tighen.Then put in the upper screw. WHILE TIGHENING UP THE SCREWS,A LIGHT TAP ON THE HEAD OF THE DRIVER WITH A HAMMER WILL HELP SEAL AND TIGHEN THEM UP."
582921,pics,2011-05-14 23:06:00,1268,Check out the seafoam website...looks to be a good product for outboards..
582927,glen,2011-05-14 23:09:00,2641,Princess Auto has the refill pump on sale for about $5.  That lower unit  should hold about 300ml of oil.  Nautilus oil is in a 1L blue bottle.  That is what i have been using for a long time.  I would like to buy it buy the 4L jug though.
582930,4x4bassin,2011-05-14 23:13:00,1025,I would spend the extra couple bucks and get the quick silver (mercury) bottom end oil as well as the mix ! It should be available at CDN tire as well .
582931,GBW,2011-05-14 23:14:00,8460,the other CTC store (parts source) might be closer for you Mike and they may have it on sale.  I still think Princess Auto over by the 401 and Thickson is your best bet.  If you need a hand tomorrow let me know.  I might be able to get out for a bit.  G
582938,misfish,2011-05-14 23:25:00,29133, I give up. What mess  Maybe doing it wrong?
582939,glen,2011-05-14 23:26:00,2641,Are you filling up from the bottom hole like you are suppose to?
582940,glen,2011-05-14 23:28:00,2641,One of the things i have been doing when changing any oil is measuring the amount of oil that came out.  Then i make sure i put the same amount back in.
582952,irishfield,2011-05-14 23:55:00,26272,I also suggest once it's full and coming out the top hole... to put the TOP screw back in FIRST while you still have the bottle squeezed in the bottom hole. If air can't get in then oil won't come out the bottom. Top screw in first.. remove the bottle/pump and then install the bottom screw.
582953,zeeter,2011-05-14 23:58:00,92,"I have the exact same evinrude motor.  Good motor, but use ethanol free gas only - higher grade.  Anytime you plan on not using the motor for a couple of weeks disconnect the fuel hose and run it till it stalls and the fuel is out of the system.  Winterize properly.  It will be a great, dependable motor if you keep up with those things."

582955,irishfield,2011-05-15 00:00:00,26272,Hey.. I look out for you newfs!
582957,strik,2011-05-15 00:16:00,175,  Hey not trying to jump the thread but i was wondering where you get ethanol free gas i was told all gas now had at least 10 % in it however the guy in town who sells gas told me that  maby he dont not want  to see me go lol  Anyone ever uses a product called Phaze 4?  Take Care
582964,glen,2011-05-15 00:34:00,2641,Sunoco or shell my still have ethanol free gas in there highest octane.  I dont have either anywhere near me though.
582969,Roy,2011-05-15 00:52:00,13728,"Top back in first.....think ""airlock""."

582978,MCTFisher9120,2011-05-15 01:11:00,3761,"Hey everybody, I'm getting the products I need tomorrow. Thanks for the tips and advice.  Here is what I think I should do lol  Remove top and bottom screw...measure out how much drains out of the unit.  When filling up, fill from the bottom to the top...once full and coming out put the top screw in first...tap gently while turning it in.  Then put in bottom screw(super quick I assume)  Get Nautilus or Quick silver lower unit oil.  Buy Premium fuel for it...the expensive stuff...simple right?  And do I need to winterize...I like the run until it stalls on last trip out then store back in my bacement would be fine..maybe get the ""fogging"" advice from some of you...will be stored until early to late march when I get into some calm weather trolling for trout.  And have fun doing it  Thanks for the solid advice guys, If I'm putting in fancy gas I am not spending money on sea foam....2 bucks a L for the crap probably haha"
582981,irishfield,2011-05-15 01:15:00,26272,Mike.. put container under skeg.. pull bottom screw first! Remove top screw and let drain. If it's milky you have a sealing washer or a prop seal issue. Run your fingers thru the oil.. make sure there's no metal in it. Fill thru bottom hole... fill until it's coming out the top hole well and it's clean new oil. Put top screw in with new washer.. remove bottle and put bottom screw back in with new washer. You don't have to be real quick.. but don't be a snail!
