583377,danbouck,2011-05-15 22:49:00,4380,"We decided that it's time to get rid of my Grandfathers boat and I'm trying to figure out a selling price. I'll throw on some pictures and if anyone can let me know a ballpark price that would be great.  It's an old (no idea on year) 18' Starcraft Holiday with a 115 Evinrude. Comes with a custom made trailer that's built like a tank, comes with a box that mounts on it when the boat's in the water. My grandfather bought it new.  Once I figure out a price, it will go in the classifieds here.  The Problems:  - The transom will need to be replaced, it still holds strong but should be replaced. - The motor has only been used a handful of times in the last couple years so it will need a tuneup - It's an older boat that sat in the water 4 months out of the year and is stained below the water line - The ownership for the trailer is long gone  The pics that I have, can grab more this weekend      "
583403,HTHM,2011-05-15 23:52:00,4082,"Based on the trim that I can see in the opics, I would judge it to be a early to mid 70's hull. To redo the transom is a big job, but if done will add at least a thousand to the value IMHO The motor is probably worth 700 - 1500- it's old and a fuel hog. The trailer would be worth ~500 on a good day - ownership is easy just re-register as a home-built. This paticular hull is very sought-after as it is proven to be one of the best big-water hulls out there. And the fact that it is setup for an outboard is an advantage as a lot of them were I/O. It is much easier to upgrade your powertrain if it is an out board. I have seen these for as little as $300 and as much as $9000 when I was looking for the bow rider version of this hull. I would be tempted to take on another project, but..."

583483,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-16 02:25:00,10439,Dan I would say it's worth somewhere in the $2500 range just looking at the pics. If you could get some better pics with the trailer it would be easier to tell.
583484,SlowPoke,2011-05-16 02:29:00,2984,"The good news is, it's an outboard. The bad news is, it's a closed bow. Just a wild guess from the limited information but I'd say $2200-$3200. If it's on the ratty side of needing work, closer to $2200. If good care and maintenance is evident but still needs some reconditioning, closer to $3200."
583485,livinisfishin,2011-05-16 02:32:00,661,"I bought a 16' 1974 holiday with a '89 mercury 45 hp. I paid 2000. In my opinion you get what you pay for my boat is solid and so far has been very reliable. I didn't have to do anything to it. That being said I still have original sleeper seats, they are ready to come out. Transom is good and strong and it doesn't leak and the motor is great I saw the exact same boat with a '74. 70hp johnson on the back with 4 new swivel seats asking 2500. With a 115 I think you could probably get a decent amount."
583486,landry,2011-05-16 02:33:00,1005,"My pop just passed away and we went through this same sort of thing. We sold his beloved organ for a song. He loved playing and singing for his family and it was a great organ and looked after but it was old. It felt wrong to sell it for so little but nobody wanted it and an older gentleman was really excited to get it.Unfortunately, I think you'd be lucky to get 1500 for it - not meaning to be rude. It is a very old boat and buying it would be a gamble or a lot of work and maybe more $ invested. Just my guess Landry   "
583488,dhickey,2011-05-16 02:36:00,1038,HT knows somebody els that wants and needs a boat and has the know how to get it done.. So I am intrested in taking a look.
583489,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-05-16 02:44:00,1107,I got well over all the prices given So far for my 18' holiday I/O but mine had a updated interior and I spruced it up a bit just by cleaning and fixing a few things if everything works I would list it for $4000 and see what happens you don't want to give it away.
583515,solopaddler,2011-05-16 09:38:00,8605,I'll agree on $2500 give or take for the package as well.
583519,danbouck,2011-05-16 10:02:00,4380,"Thanks guys, i will pull it out this weekend and really go over it. Probably at least get her running strong and clean her up. But my mom does want it gone so i dont have too much time to do much to it."
583592,craigdritchie,2011-05-16 13:28:00,1586,"Fair price really depends what else is out there at the time. Somewhere from $2,000 to $2,500 is probably fair based on your description. This is definitely the right time of year to move it."
