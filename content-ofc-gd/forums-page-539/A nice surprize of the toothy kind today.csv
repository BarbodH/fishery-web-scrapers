Within a half hour I had one on, softly hooked. It managed to get away , fine by me there must others around that are more hungry. Yah right, I missed my opurtunity alright Casting away, I caught a few smallies about a lbs or2, threw them back in a continued casting, then I  hollored FISH ON!!! THIS ONES BIG!!! A 29.25 inch Gator Why am I happy about a little gator? Because I havent scene nor caught one with a girth like this in years in this area. It reassures me that things are good in the river For the better part she swam away quickly and unharmed   "
