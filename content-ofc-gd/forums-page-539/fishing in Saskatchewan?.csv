583531,Handlebarz,2011-05-16 11:37:00,3790,Hey all I might be heading to Saskatchewan about 3 hours north of Regina I was wondering if anyone here knows of some good pike walleye or bass fishing that would be around there?  My Brother does some fishing but they don't catch a lot of fish so I thought the OFC family might have some pointers for the area. Heck I would love to get out trout fishing if that is close by.
583534,HTHM,2011-05-16 11:40:00,4082,"When you are in northern Sask, take a dart throw it at a map and you should do alright. The fishing there is very good. You going to Prince Albert?"
583538,Handlebarz,2011-05-16 11:51:00,3790,No not prince Albert a little east of there Melfort I think its called.
583583,ehg,2011-05-16 13:23:00,2666,You could be a lucky guy. Maybe the best walleye fishing going is about 30 miles to the northeast of Melfort in Tobin Lake. Check out this link... http://www.walleyeheaven.com/world-record-walleye-ice-fishing.htm  Huge walleye and pike are found very close to where you will be. Good Luck

583591,jim,2011-05-16 13:27:00,124, Ditto!!  I grew up not far from Melfort.  Every puddle has pike and 'pickerel'.  You're in for a real treat.

583644,Handlebarz,2011-05-16 15:18:00,3790,I think there trailer is on Tobin lake. Any ideas on what works on them bodies of water? I know he likes to use red/white spoons.

583687,Twocoda,2011-05-16 16:54:00,4130,as others have stated ...throw a dart at a map ... Ive fished Waskasue and Pike Lakes amongst other smaller ones with great success but ultimately Lake Diefenbacker is on my bucket list for the record breaking rainbows...  Good Luck ...my memories are over 25 years old and still vivid as if they were yesterday...
