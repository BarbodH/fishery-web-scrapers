So I head off to Scugog for a bit after 1:00PM.  The walleye bite was a short bite and ended up 0/3 on the 'magic' bait and ended up with tail bite off's only.  after a change of plans I eneded up with 5 OOS bass, 5 perch (dinks), 2 crappy's (keepers but let them go) and a good 50 or more sunfish!  Some keepers and some dinks but all went back to swim another day.  It was a fun day for 2 hours or so on the water when I wasn't planning on going out.  Sorry, no pic's as the rain was brutal and I didn't want to kill my wife's cam as she would kill me if I did.  G"
