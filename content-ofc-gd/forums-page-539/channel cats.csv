583325,Michael_Brown,2011-05-15 20:54:00,411,"The Town of Pembroke, Ottawa river offers some of the best channel catfish action anywhere. Not the real monsters like Dunnville but it can be non-stop action and good shore access.  For me the best bait is hands down frozen mackeral chunks. The skin is tough and stays on the hook, the bait is oily and if they is a catfish around it will eat this. Just get a frozen mackeral at the grocery store and cut small steaks about 1 inch thick.

583345,ehg,2011-05-15 21:48:00,2666,The Grand R. around Dunnville is probably closest and your best choice. Good Luck
