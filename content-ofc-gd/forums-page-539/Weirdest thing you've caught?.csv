I get there i and i start feeling up around for my hook, when i looked down i realized i was feeling up the end tip of the grenade that never detonated in ww2 probably. Told some firefighters about it and they pulled it out gently lol."

496697,kgeary,2010-08-21 04:25:00,82,"Oh this is fun, brought out some great memories.  I can recall catching a line attached to a daredevle in a 44 inch pikes mouth. I removed the hook and released the fish.  A stringer of walleye.  Lots of rod and reel combos The strangest was when I actually watched a guy lose his rod, caught it a yr later, gave to my sister in law, watched her throw it overboard when she hooked a fish and had a glass of wine in one hand. (she said she didn't want to spill her wine) . Then I caught that rod for the second time the following yr. ( I let her use it again this summer).  Watched a guy fishing off the dock and a pike take all his line ""spooled him"" jumped in a boat went out and scooped the line up with my rod tip and tied it to my line reeled in a forty something pike for him. released it.  A stringer of walleye with a pike that swallowed one of the walleye on the stringer.  had pike eat walleye on stringers tied to the the dock or the boat back in the days before livewells. (guess that says something for using a stringer aye! )  rocks that I've actually landed (many times).   The best was a 6 foot balsam tree Had me very excited for a while it moved slowly with slow head shakes and moved in a semi circle I was sure it was a huge walleye for a few minutes.  a 12-14 foot wide Manta Ray ( in the bahamas) on a hand line. It came out of the water and did a barrel roll. Didn't land it.   I've had pike jump into the boat One time from the opposite side from where I was casting.  Had a pike do a head stand on the gunwale of the boat.  A pair of sunglasses.  various clothing.  an anchor rope with an anchor attached.  Watched a guy lose a 40 something pike with a Johnson silver minnow on which he had paintes little smiley facesand then caught that fish with the same spoon 4 miles away a few hours later. Have caught Pike with lures in their mouths many times but that was impressive.  A 48 inch silver pike ( world line class record)  A pike with an exact muskie stripe pattern but in reverse  Thanks for the thread"

Fast forward a few hours and I ended up dragging his rig out of the deep after he'd left.  I've dragged ticking watches, children's Snoopy fishing rod with a 10lb bow still attached, women's underwear up when pier chucking but just in pure dollar value that one topped everything else combined.  Score for me.  The weirdest one though was definitely the zombie carp I caught out of Hamilton.  Couldn't believe this thing was still alive let alone actively feeding through the hole in it's face.

On my first carping trip ever one of these guys was circling around my lure and kind of ruined the spot lol.  I really do like them though.  I saw one the other week swim up right beside me and stick his head out of the water and look up at me.  He hung out for a minute and swam about 6 feet away and just chilled.  It was the biggest snapping turtle I've ever seen.  It looked like something pre-historic.

After about 15 minutes trying to get it in I am standing there with the net and he reels in a 10 lb rock with a weird hole in it. Thats where his rapala hooked on to it. The look on his face was priceless, he was so pissed he snapped his rod over his knee and threw the whole oufit in the lake. Then we spent an hour fishing for his Curado which we got back but the Crucial was a gonner. Everey time I think about that I still laugh my ass off, I actually thought for a bit that he was going to punch me in the face cause I was teasing him to the max."

Weirdest thing for me was an albino smallmouth bass, it was about three pounds and even had pink eyes, otherwise it was white, thought it was a cisco at first. Caught in Three Mile Lake in Muskoka. I never even thought to keep it, we just stared at it for a minute and dropped it back in.  I caught a blind pike once, missing one eye and the other was obviously damaged, probably a bad hook job but it still hit a spinnerbait.

I got him close and the ms. snapped a pic before managed to free the hook from him with long pliers and he swam away happy. Very respectable and aggressive creatures.  The way it hit I was hoping it was a monster bass but no luck!  Got a carp after jigging in the river and catching on to someone else's line that broke off and had the carp on the other end.  
496029,Parisite,2010-08-19 02:57:00,66,Caught a seagull at Ramsey Lake in Sudbury.  I was using a top water lure.  The seagull spotted it and dive bombed it.  He realized his mistake and tried to fly away but he was hooked.  I flew him like a kite for a few minutes while trying to figure out how I was going to get my best top water lure back.  I reeled him in and covered him with a sweater while I tried removing the hooks (Treble on each end).  I would get one end free and the other one would hook him.  As I cut the line to make things easier he squirmed and pecked his way out of my grasp and took off with the lure.
