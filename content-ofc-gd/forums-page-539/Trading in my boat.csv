583215,Billy Bob,2011-05-15 15:58:00,5865,After much thought and a lot of rain I have decided it's best to trade in my beloved 1985 Grumman boat motor and trailer for a Ark....don't have any experience with Arks but it seems like the right thing to do...and after I get the Ark I will be collecting the animals...of course some will not be invited.... mosquitoes will not be allowed and it's not looking good for cats either. I guess the round gobies and dreaded zebra mussels wouldn't make the cut either....LOL....any other pest I should leave out...

583758,Headhunter,2011-05-16 19:36:00,5703,"Hey BB, check out the F650 thread, might be an answer to your towing concerns! HH"
583764,mercman,2011-05-16 19:45:00,7054,  A couple of Cummins b series would do the trick if you could sync the props Bob
