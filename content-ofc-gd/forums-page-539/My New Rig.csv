583436,Millhouse2020,2011-05-16 00:50:00,152,"  Yep, its a 2006 Canadian 18ft.  The engine is a 60HP Evinrude Etec.  Played with it a bit this weekend.  Once I had the trim dialed in correctly, it rode pretty good.  Scary fast, Im not used to that kind of power in a tiller but I will just have to get used to it.  I am looking forward to the walleye opener next weekend..."
