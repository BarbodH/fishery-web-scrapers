I added Bread crumbs to my giant maiz arson and landed 3 in 2 hours while fishing during the rain yesterday. Lorne's previews post also suggested that we need to puncture each corn for it to absorb the sweet vanilla while being stored in the container. For 45 minutes, I was using a corn that has not absorb much sweet vanilla, nothing was happening, than I selected and replace my corn with one that had absorb the sweet vanilla, also packed bread crumbs around it to create scent that will disbursed to the surroundings. I then start landing them soon enough. I could have caught more, but due to the rain, I was contented by then.  The advantage of using giant corn versus Canned corn, they are more durable, I was able to salvage the corn even after landing a carp. Of course, Hair rig is always used. My shoe is exactly 11"" long, you do the estimate of the size of the fish. Due to the size of these carp, if we let our drag a touch lose just for the challenge, our reel will squell for a while before the actual fight. I was using 10 lb line.  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/IMG_0011-1.jpg http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/IMG_0009.jpg http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/IMG_0013.jpg  Water still cold and fish are not always actively feeding.  I used to just apply Canned corn to my hair rig, they work if there are no small fish trying to steal our bait. With the new Giant Maiz and packed Bread crumb combo, it seemed more efficient and the corn stays longer on our hair rig. I will only used canned corn during emergency or when not planning ahead of time.  I read that dried sweetened Pineapple sold at bulk barn are excellent bait as well.  Did not do well this year on trout fishing, so this small successful day made me feel good again."

583618,Homer Is King,2011-05-16 14:19:00,305,"Beauty carp!!  I noticed that the last carp looks different.  It has a much different scale structure.  I assumed that is what you guys were talking about when you said ""nice mirror"".  A quick google seach confirmed this.  My linkhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_carp  Congrats on nailing a rare carp!"
