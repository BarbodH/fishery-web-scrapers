583380,mercman,2011-05-15 22:59:00,7054,"Just got a couple of Mustang Inflatable PFD`s. Auto/manual operation. Question i have is this, Do i have to keep the regular PFD`s on the boat also, or can i just have the inflatables on. I have been told that with inflatables, you must where them at all times, if you do not have regular PFD`s on board.I have done some searching,but nothing really answers this clearly enough for me.  Thanks for any info  Paul"
583408,HTHM,2011-05-15 23:58:00,4082,An inflatable is not considered to be a PFD unless worn. If you have a LEO that wants to give you grief then your best defence is to have a regular PFD within reach while you are fishing. Otherwise keep it (inflatable) on at all times. Not a bad idea when you think about it.
583415,workwear,2011-05-16 00:09:00,592,must keep it on at all times.......dont know why....but ive heard its the law!!!!
583450,Tom McCutcheon,2011-05-16 01:13:00,627," It is no good to you if you don't have it on when you go in the drink, is it? If it is not auto inflate then it would be tough for you to grab it and pull the cord when it is sinking too, or even still on the boat. If it is auto inflate, they normaly have to be about two to four feet under water before they deploy. Again, no good to you. That is why it is law to wear them, not just have them near you."
583451,vance,2011-05-16 01:15:00,719,"Yes you need to have it on for it to count as pfd,I always wear mine as I figure if push comes to shove and you really need it you won't be leaving the boat voluntarily but under duress and maybe unconscious!!!  vance"
583467,mercman,2011-05-16 01:47:00,7054,"But if i am wearing it (The inflatable)at all times, do i need to bring the other, standard vests on the boat also."
583468,irishfield,2011-05-16 01:48:00,26272,NO
583473,mercman,2011-05-16 02:00:00,7054,"thanks Wayne. Case closed. Cause i always wear my PFD when i am in the boat, even if it means i lose my Man Card  Thanks everyone"
583487,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-05-16 02:35:00,1107,I wear mine all the time to Paul
583566,bigbuck,2011-05-16 13:08:00,2449,"I wear my inflatable all the time too and I always have more PFDs on board than I need. Mine is a manual, I heard that the auto inflatables inflate sometimes when stored in a very damp place."
583576,The Urban Fisherman,2011-05-16 13:18:00,2050," Ditto - I don't have an auto inflate but I do wear my PFD all the time when alone, with the kids or with my brother who can't swim! lol When I get a Mustang A/I I will wear it all the time regardless of who I'm with.  I'm going to wear one all the time this year while filming Facts of Fishing THE SHOW with Dave and I might just ""forget"" to put it back in the boat compartment when I leave one day....   haha He's offered me one a bunch of times but I always forget to grab it.  On a side note, it's always nice to have something on board that floats - (mandatory safety rope is fine) but I still like to have a spare (regular) PFD on the boat for back-up.  Just the way I am as I always have at least one of my kids on board and you can never be to safe.  Cheers, Ryan"
