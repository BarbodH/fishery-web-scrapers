Rick missed a decent pike on a minnow bait...had it hooked up then she let go...fished some more and I pulled out a small pike on a firetiger spinnerbait.    That was it for this weekend, next Friday I leave for the next 2 months guiding for giant pike and walleye this summer! Very excited and determined to be the best guide I can be, looking forward to learning a lot and making some good friends along the way.  So guess this is my last report until the last week in July...I will have a dandy of a report then.  Take Care OFC!  MTBF"
