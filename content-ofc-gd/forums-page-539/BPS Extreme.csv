583724,NAW,2011-05-16 18:39:00,4022,"Hey guys,  My friends Dad purchased a BPS Extreme bait cast combo a few years ago.  He never could get used to the rig, and so it sat in his boat, and never got used.  I think he might have taken 100 casts with the rod.  Maybe a little trolling.  He decided to sell the combo, and told me to make him an offer.  My offer of $50 was accepted.  Now that I've purchased this rig, I have a few questions.  Has anyone used this rig before.  7.1:1, right hand, on a BPS extreme MH single peace rod.   I'm just wondering if anyone has any input, good or bad, about it.  Tips or tricks specific to this set up.  I was also wondering about line.  I have about 80 yards of Power-Pro 30Lb braid I was going to spool it with.  Mostly want this rod for pike, Musky, and trolling for deep water walleye, and Lakers.  I realize this in an entry level combo, but I figured it's a great rod to start with for Bait casting, and If I don't like it, there's always the OFC classified section.."
583959,ehg,2011-05-17 02:40:00,2666,Had an Extreme baitcaster/rod combo medium i bought 5 yrs. ago. Paid 100 bucks for it new at Bass Pro and used it quite regularly with 30 lb. Power Pro with no problems. Used it for bass topwaters and spinnerbaits. I wouldn't use it for muskies. It found the bottom of lake last year by accident. 50 bucks is a good price.

Thanks for the info.  I only was going to string it with 30 lb power pro, cuz that what I have kicking around my place."
