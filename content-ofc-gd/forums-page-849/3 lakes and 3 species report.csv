I had heard the suckers were in the creek and thought it would be fun to have a go catching some. I had a net which would have been easier but the kid wanted to use a rod and line, so i grabbed some small minnows and we headed out. I got 2,  the kid tried but was unlucky.   QUITE A FEW IN THERE, GOT A COUPLE SMALL ONES      After that we headed up the road to a good bass lake by the highway, i kinda thought the water might still be a bit cold and the bass not very active as the lake is spring fed and the ice only cleared of it a week ago. I was wrong, we were there for an hour and got 5 all from shore with slip bobbers and minnows, i lost a real lunker...aint that always the way.    KID HOOKED INTO FIRST ONE, IF IT WAS NOT FOR CONFIDENTIALITY YOU WOULD SEE THE BIGGEST GRIN ON HIS FACE      I GOT 3 SMALLER ONES AFTER THAT           AND OF COURSE THE BIG ONE IS 'THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY'      After work i decided to have a few casts at the bottom of our yard......and finally got a decent pike...water must be warming up now, lots of minnows and shiners in the shallows.  It should be non-stop big pike down there now for the next 2 weeks before the water warms up more and they move away from the bay, they are always around, but for 2 weeks at ice out there are usually large numbers of  large pike right there. I only had one big minnow left so after i got that one i called it a day and grabbed a few moments to watch another beautiful sunset.    THATS MORE LIKE IT.....MAYBE 30""      USUAL GREAT SUNSET        "
