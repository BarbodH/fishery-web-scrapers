Everything was caught trolling #7 shad raps, chartreuse and perch, in 10-12 feet of water near new weed growth  Water temp out from the west shore (Long Beach) ranged from 54.5° to 55.5°. Water temp along the south shore around Kennedy Bay was around 58°. Still pretty chilly.  Mighty nice to be out."

Lets just say the wallaye didnt  like our lures on sturgeon today. Only a few OOS bass. Oh wel, all the whities and lakers satisfied my fish catching needs of the day. I always find  kawartha walleye to be much more avtive once the water temps get over 60 and the weedlines are more defined"
