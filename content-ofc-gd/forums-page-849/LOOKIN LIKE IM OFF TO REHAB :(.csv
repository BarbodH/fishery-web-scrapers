WAS DEBATING TO GO BACK TO THE CAR AND SAID OK JUST ONE MORE CORNER. WASNT IN A RUSH SINCE I WAS SOLO TODAY. WELL I HIT THE CORNER AND STARTED DRIFTING . LETS PUT IT THIS WAY . I ROLLED 30 ROE SACS LAST NIGHT. I WAS OUT BY 9AM. THEN WENT TO THE PINKIES. AWESOME STAINED WATER BAIT. STARTED NAILING THEM ON THAT. AROUND 11 THE WATER STARTED CLEARIN UP QUICK. THE BITES STOPPED. NO FISH LEFT TO BITE MAYBE MOST WOULD THINK AFTER CATCHIN THAT MANY. TURNED OVER TO THE JIGS AND IT STARTED ALL OVER AGAIN.

341035,River Rat,2009-05-13 13:17:00,161,"I assumed you were hitting the rehab for steroids!!!  Ok, don't rage on me now...jus kidding.....and thanks for the ""rub in"" text on the way back from the river. I had to avoid sharp objects for a while till I got over missing the hit.  P.S. got out Monday night and hit the water at 6:30......I haven't seen smallies like that anywhere but Simcoe, some real pigs. OOS of course so no pics, released boatside in water........as the sun set I found those late hitting eyes I was telling you about, stayed out till 11pm and whacked em good! Had 4 or 5 litterally smack my crank as it hit the water....weird feeling for them in the dark.  RR"
