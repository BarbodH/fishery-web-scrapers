340879,mepps,2009-05-13 00:51:00,1301,"Harris park used to be a fav spot of mine, but as of last week the water levels were VERY high. If the rain would stay away for a bit, the fishing should be solid.  The carp in the area LOVE corn. In teh heat of the summer, when the water is low, you can see them all over the place.  Good Luck!  Heres a nice little pike and carp I caught a couple summers ago...    "
