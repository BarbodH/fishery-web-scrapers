341001,Roy,2009-05-13 10:04:00,13728,"Thanks for posting, Jamie. I must say, very photogenic and you too. Nice yak too. When's marlin season open?"

341021,jediangler,2009-05-13 12:19:00,1923,"Nice one Jamie. They do give a great sleigh ride, don't they."
341044,Guest gbfisher,2009-05-13 13:48:00,0,Nice deal for sure there Jamie.  Gotta get the Bow goin!....
341048,bassjnkie,2009-05-13 14:56:00,1101,"Nice carp!! That must have been loads of fun from a kayak. What was you setup, rod, reel, bait? Do you anchor the kayak? Anyways, great job."
341054,Victor,2009-05-13 16:24:00,1609,Great catch Jamie! Looks like it must be fun catching them on the yak! Gotta try that someday
341055,gdelongchamp,2009-05-13 16:25:00,199,Nice fish Jamie. Why is it looking up at you in that pose?  Did you try tying a  harness to it and let it pull you around in that water. Trolling.
341072,Crazyhook,2009-05-13 17:15:00,1154," classic set up, baitrunner combo with my new secret corn receipe!"
341075,Guest gbfisher,2009-05-13 17:18:00,0,  ...pose? ....at least he isnt covering up the tail ..........
341120,hammercarp,2009-05-13 18:51:00,964,Nice fish. Another carp another happy angler.  I gota wonder what a 30+ would be like out of one of those cockle shells.
341179,Leecher,2009-05-13 22:48:00,7832,Beauty carp Jamie Well done and thanks for sharing Leechman
341181,ccmtcanada,2009-05-13 22:51:00,7971,"Love the Solopaddler pose!!! Great fish!  I've caught a carp and chinook in our canoe before...not as small as a kayak, but had both of them tow me around!!"
341232,lazybum,2009-05-14 00:55:00,142, Sometimes I don't know which one smells worse MJL's secret recipe or the carp itself. Victor's is pretty potent too. Whew!!!  I did find that the carp in Long Sault and Waddington NY didn't smell very much. I guess they didn't get much chance to eat those two guys secret bait.

341254,MJL,2009-05-14 01:27:00,2427,Awesome job with the yak Jamie!  One thing I've always wanted to try was to hook a big carp from a float tube.
