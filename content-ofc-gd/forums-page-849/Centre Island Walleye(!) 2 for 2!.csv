341083,slashbait,2009-05-13 17:34:00,3,"Hey guys... I just joined up here now that I've re-discovered my childhood fishing fanaticism.  I just started going to the Toronto Islands last year, when I caught a couple of pike.  I've been out both of the past weekends, but can't seem to find the pike yet this year.  However last Sunday (the 10th), the first cast of the day brought in this walleye in the same spot where I caught a nearly identical one the week before:    The one from the week before (no pic, sorry) was on a firetiger Rapala HJ-14, this one was caught with a clown x-rap (XR-10 size, 4"" for scale).  Not that I'm complaining, but I'm still jealous of some of you guys with your 5 and 6 pike days out there...  Maybe the long weekend will be better to me."
341086,Victor,2009-05-13 17:46:00,1609,"That's pretty good for your first report! Have rarely heard of walleye being caught out of the islands, but it's a good thing to see them there i guess!  Welcome aboard!"
341087,highdrifter,2009-05-13 17:48:00,2534,There goes the neighbourhood...  Was it released?  Nice fish!!  Cheers HD
341089,Carp,2009-05-13 17:50:00,1488,Good to see the walleye around the islands. They're biting during daylight hours too. Bonus !!!  Nice shootin' !
341094,CLofchik,2009-05-13 18:01:00,854,"There've been two pickeral (they're not walleye until they cross the US border!) caught in Hamilton Harbour in the last week, nice to see them making a better comeback then the Atlantics  Pike are officially late this year with the water temps......or it will be just a crappy year for them.  Every harbour west of TO I caught pike in this time last year I haven't gotten a sniff.  Live Target's Smelt sure looks purdy in the water though"
341097,slashbait,2009-05-13 18:02:00,3," Thanks! To answer your question, it never left the water.  I just popped the hook out, turned the fish around, and after maybe 2 seconds of ""reviving"" off he went. Quick and easy, plus the slime stays on the fish where it belongs rather than getting all over me, my camera, etc."
341098,mepps,2009-05-13 18:02:00,1301,"Nice!  I've never caught a walleye out there, got a nice pike last Saturday though!"
341103,Jet,2009-05-13 18:16:00,364,Nice catch. Indeed a rare thing to see on the Islands.
341104,highdrifter,2009-05-13 18:18:00,2534," Well done!  Would be nice to hook into more of those than them pesky, toothy snoot rockets.  Pike suck!!  Imagine a sustainable walleye fishery, in the downtown core...  Wicked.  props brotha.  HD"
341106,spinnerbaitking,2009-05-13 18:21:00,1622,Nice WALLEYE something I haven't fished for alot Richard
341110,sandmann,2009-05-13 18:24:00,51,"I agree, it is great/surprise to see pickerel in local T.O."
341116,EC1,2009-05-13 18:41:00,930,nice to see you catch walleye at the toronto islands!
341125,JoshS,2009-05-13 19:00:00,729,Thats what I like to see!  Goodstuff!  Better than any pike under 35in IMO
341138,mark_74,2009-05-13 20:03:00,24,FYI Walleye and Pickerel are two seperate species. Walleye are part of the perch family and Pickeral are part of the Pike family.
341144,bigredfisher,2009-05-13 20:31:00,300,walleye is Canadian and pickerel is American
341149,yakpiker,2009-05-13 21:01:00,160,Hey SlashBait...congrats on your second walleye.  I think I cruised by you in my kayak the day you caught your first.  Were they both in the same area?  YakPiker
341150,irishfield,2009-05-13 21:04:00,26272, ummmm NO !  Great fish for the islands fella !
341154,Beans,2009-05-13 21:26:00,3339,Never heard of walleye until I started reading fishing magazines and the American writers called them walleye...  My grandfather and my father called them pickerel and so did anyone I fished with...  I s'pose Canadians (guides)adopted the name so as to not offend our southern neighbors...(God forbid !!!) (Who won the war of 1812 anyways?)  Pickerel forever !!!
341167,mark_74,2009-05-13 22:14:00,24,Here's some reading material for all you Pickerel fans!  http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/ind...s=A1ARTA0006280 http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/ind...s=A1ARTA0008425
341182,siwash,2009-05-13 22:53:00,683, FYI a number of Atlantics have been caught and positively ID this spring in Lake O
341185,siwash,2009-05-13 22:57:00,683," The War of 1812 was acrually won by the British! Canada didn't even exist as a nation at the time - and we didn't make a move w/o British approval until about the WWII!  Then we had to listen  to another master... Unky Sam... it ain't so bad being a colony of two great empires!  Walleye, pickerel.. what's the diff?!"
341384,bigbuck,2009-05-14 13:54:00,2449,"Walleye and pickeral taste the same. I can't tell the difference..........LOL  In the states, there is a species of fish called the Chain Pickeral, it's a pretty cool looking fish."
341402,msp,2009-05-14 14:49:00,1336,  Not really
341408,Spiel,2009-05-14 15:09:00,9065," We have pickerel in Canada, Grass Pickerel, Chain Pickerel and Redfin Pickerel."
341411,irishfield,2009-05-14 15:17:00,26272, ..and the tastey YELLOW PICKERAL !!
