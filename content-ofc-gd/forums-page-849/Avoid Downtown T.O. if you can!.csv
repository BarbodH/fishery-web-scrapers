341060,Headhunter,2009-05-13 16:41:00,5703,"are everywhere in the downtown core this morning. It appears as though they are positioning themselves for the rally going on at Queens Park. Here, at Bay and Queen, we have two bus loads of ETF, dozens of riot equiped police ... so, if you don't have to come down town today, don't! HH"
341063,fishnsled,2009-05-13 16:48:00,3520,Get out while you still can HH!!! We need you to be north this weekend
341066,JohnF,2009-05-13 16:58:00,3494, That's what I tell people every day.  JF
341073,Headhunter,2009-05-13 17:16:00,5703,"It appeaars they are serious this time! Walking around at lunch, I noticed uniforms from all over the province. OPP and T.O. cops together, court officers, you name it. HH"
341076,Toronto_Angler,2009-05-13 17:20:00,698,I work at Bay and Queen as well....Lots of ETF
341077,mdej,2009-05-13 17:21:00,98,"Yes the police presence is large.  I'm by the Royal York and police in riot gear everywhere.  However my understanding is the human chain that was to span the downtown core was called off earlier this morning buy the organizers.  Looking out my window now all I see it some police and Timmy's cups, not a protester in site.  In fact a very nice day downtown!  Not sure about the Queens Park area."
341088,lookinforwalleye,2009-05-13 17:49:00,4399,"It does not take a protest for me to avoid TO. LOL, Toronto has nothing I need or want you can keep all your protests and all your special interest groups!  I moved out of Toronto in the early 80's and have never looked back, the fam and I are quite happy living north of the mullet line."
341100,Carp,2009-05-13 18:09:00,1488,Just another day in the core of Toronto. I avoid that place like an east wind.  Very nice to view the city from the lake at night though Last year I stayed out until dark just for that reason. No roads for the protesters to block out there.  Late nights driving along the Gardiner Expressway is very nice too. Providing there are no pedestrians going for a stroll across the highway.
341164,holdfast,2009-05-13 22:11:00,1813,"Maybe (The ""Abandoner""), Iggy will step in again and make promises like he did the other day to protesters that blocked your Highway over crap outside this Country who are Terrorists.  What a Pussy."
341194,RuNnYoOzE,2009-05-13 23:16:00,270,"Toronto is lovely downtown until the sun sets and ""things"" emerge."
341301,outdoorguy61,2009-05-14 03:09:00,220,"I really wish that those that want to fight and protest would consider their options carefully and leave Canada, if they feel so strongly, rather than instill age old hostilitys, into what is a most welcoming home for most immigrants.  outdoorguy61"
341309,Greencoachdog,2009-05-14 03:40:00,8163,  Like you???
341316,RuNnYoOzE,2009-05-14 05:30:00,270,  Gee thanks I guess there is bias when it comes to flaming......great thanks ..wow
341319,fishing n autograph,2009-05-14 07:03:00,2540,Pretty much every service in the GTA is lending Toronto their public order units (those guys you see in riot gear)....it's pretty scarey how fast things can go south and it will sooner or later
341368,holdfast,2009-05-14 12:59:00,1813," Too Bad WE have to spend money so you, our public security has to uphold Law and Order against a bunch of Losers that have absolutely no Business disturbing the piece for their ( Not Mine) agenda.  Who bloody well cares about their crap.  Like my RSM always told us.   IF you don't like it.  GET OUT.   These pussies know that they have it good here, but just don't appreciate our tolerances."
341370,holdfast,2009-05-14 13:03:00,1813," Sorry, I forgot.  Thanks for putting your family life on hold because of these Idiots.  I know you dont get paid overtime, however your on Duty 24 hrs with the same pay.  I appreciate that as I know a little what it is like."
341374,ketchenany,2009-05-14 13:18:00,3229,"Holdfast, You hit the nail right on the head, my sentiments exactly."
341381,Fish Farmer,2009-05-14 13:46:00,2234,"If their so concerned, send them back to help their own. Why did they come here? Now it's costing us money. We have enough problems here, we don't need there crap."
341382,Headhunter,2009-05-14 13:46:00,5703,"Funny how a thread I started to help out my fellow members, ie avoid down town, has once again been hijacked into a promoting one's political opinions. None were asked for, none were required. Start your own thread! Thanks guys! HH"
341391,lookinforwalleye,2009-05-14 14:17:00,4399,Well you knew that was going to happen didn`t you?
341394,Headhunter,2009-05-14 14:28:00,5703,"Well, I had high hopes that a level of decorum would prevail, but alas, I was once again incorrect. One can still hope though, can't they. HH"
341398,Roy,2009-05-14 14:33:00,13728,"Thanks for the heads up, Joe."
