341018,Marko,2009-05-13 12:09:00,854,"Decided to hit a local pike pond, lots in there just fairly small. Got there with Victor and Trevor and washed our lures for about an hour and not even a sniff. If the pike are in there usually we`d have a few in an hour. I guess they have not moved in yet, might try it again on the weekend. Realized there was a small trout pond just down the road, and there is a little creek connecting the pond to Nith river. Decided to give it a go, had some worms to drown. Managed to get into few little ones, some of the prettiest fish you`ll ever see.  First fish of the day   Not sure what this little guy is, is it a baby brown??   This was the biggest one of the day, did not really want to kill him but he was bleeding prety bad and hooked very deep   Victor got 2 little trout as well as few chubs. Trevor got skunked.....again haha  All in all a nice day be out with nice company"

341058,pikeie,2009-05-13 16:37:00,380,nice fish! yep thats a brookie!
341091,lucabrasi,2009-05-13 17:55:00,114,"nice catch! At least you got out and had a good day. Yeah pike fishing is a bit slow for this time of year, in two trips I got 1 and lost 1. Could be the water temps, maybe a late spawn   I've also noticed fewer or no weeds at all in the areas I normally fish. I'm sure this is a factor as well. From talking with other anglers, slow fishing has been the theme so far. Maybe some warmer temps would help with the weed growth. I was talking with an old timer who fishes the islands a lot, he seems to think the lack of weeds is due to all the silting the city has been doing around some of the popular fishing spots."
