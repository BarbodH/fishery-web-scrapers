340937,camillj,2009-05-13 02:50:00,1988,Just thought I would mention it (no commissions or anything ) .. my new Humminbird 565 was speck-tacular .... I had set it up on a small plywood board with my H2Oc mounted beside it to keep it portable yet stable on the boat in rough weather ... used it for 4 days and ran a 12V gel cell ($25 from Le Baro*) ... two batteries lasted me for the four days at about 15 hrs a day ... perrrrrrfect ... marked fish and structure in places I hadnt realized were over 150 ft deep on my older Humminbird ...  Anyhow .. for the $$$ it was a GREAT investment ...still toying with the side scan technology but not viable as a portable just sucks too much juice ...

I was able to mark lots of fish & structure...the bad part about the unit, it doesnt make the fish bite!  cheers,  Yv"
