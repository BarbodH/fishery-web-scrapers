The day started with the tossing of the T.J Special - the venerable silver and blue streak Lucky Strike spoon. Got a walleye to follow the offering right up to the boat on 3 consecutive casts but alas no strike. Dang I regretted not tipping the spoon with a piece of worm...  The attention soon turned to the dozens of turtles swimming around us at the base a a waterfall. Fantastic    then off for some classic shoreline trolling      aside from some rock bass, only landed fish of the day - oos smallie, released with no harm    A great day and will definitely try to go back Thursday if this massive rain front can magically dissapear"
340997,solopaddler,2009-05-13 09:04:00,8605,Sweet. You might be okay for Thursday they just downgraded the rain forecast where I'm headed from 20mm to 3mm.

Right now the forecast for my gbay area is like 20mm overnight and 15 on Thursday... man I really would love to go fishn on Thursday; got the day off, got the fishn buddy to agree to plans, etc...  btw I owe you a Kenogami River report - man what an adventure; let's just say we fished for like 5 min and the rest was pure adrenaline!"
