341245,ben306,2009-05-14 01:13:00,59,"Well been in Toronto a week now and managed to get out 3 times fishing, 1st time I went down the waterfront and managed to carp on surface baits, one a high single, then the other a mid teen.  Went again yesterday, managed to get a few follows on the spinners but nothing else.  Then decided on the islands today so got the ferry at 11 and fished til about 5  Got a very good carp, chuffed to bits with it, got to be a high 20, in the 26lb-29lb bracket going off similar fish Ive caught in the uk. Baited up an area Id seen them and left it to rest for half an hr then returned to catch this nice common. 8lb main line, with a 6lb hooklink.  Thats a 2 foot landing net to give you an idea, and it was one FAT fish    Also managed to get two pike on the spinners, unfortunately I only got a picture of the smaller, as I unhooked the larger one in the water and let it go before I realised.  Biggest one was about 9lb, and then there was this one at about 3-4lb, all in all a good day tho.    Also had the joy of meeting a number of friendly people fishing who where happy enough for a quick chat, including the 2 daves (one being master basser) nice to meet you"

341248,ben306,2009-05-14 01:21:00,59,"I catch half of my carp back in England on surface baits, its all about getting the confidence of the fish up, which isnt such an issue here as theres very little pressure on the fish from anglers"
