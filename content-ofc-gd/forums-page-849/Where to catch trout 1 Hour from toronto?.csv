Would the credit still hold steelies? If so where abouts. I have yet to catch one and I've gone on multiple occasions. We're just looking to enjoy the outdoors and possible catch some fish.  Thanks -Dan"

From what I've heard and read, there are plenty of opportunities close by...just do a bit of reading and you'll find what you want closest to you.  Good luck!!!"

341542,holdfast,2009-05-14 21:54:00,1813,Coldwater creek above the 400 and Moonstone.  Follow the Rail Tracks and fish the down stream of the culverts that run across the tracks.  If I had a map Id give you a grid reference.  Youll never find them sitting on your fat butt or driving straight to the spots.  You have to actually work to find them otherwise theyll be fished out.  Small split shot and hook with worm for the brookies.
