340771,MSBruno,2009-05-12 20:49:00,369,"I'm here on my blackberry staring at this school of fish.  I'm not sure if they're trout or carp or small pike, but there's about 12 of them. I can't get a close enough look at these fish, so my guess is just that, a guess.  Anyone fish here or know what they are?  Right at the mouth a saw a monster carp and a small trout."
340772,MSBruno,2009-05-12 21:01:00,369,I walked back over to the school and the sun is hitting them right and you can see that they are a school of carp  I'll upload pics when I get home..
340774,muskeybugged,2009-05-12 21:06:00,282,You didn't get the Blackberry with the Telescoping fishing rod?
340775,Twocoda,2009-05-12 21:15:00,4130,could be suckers too ...it wouldnt surprise  me .....you know if you go down there after dark ...with a shad rap or a canadian wiggler ...youll get rainbows....right under the walk over bridge.....either side but try them both ...
340777,DRIFTER_016,2009-05-12 21:25:00,10439,Good silver bass fishing down river from the QEW too.
340778,MSBruno,2009-05-12 21:29:00,369,Silver bass?  
340781,MSBruno,2009-05-12 21:34:00,369,1

340788,The Urban Fisherman,2009-05-12 22:00:00,2050,"At the mouth of, and in the first km of the credit river you'd be surprised what you can catch...I've caught the following and know there's other species in there.  1) Carp 2) Sheephead 3) Pike 4) Bass (large & smallmouth) 5) Rainbow Trout 6) Salmon 7) Walleye  Do some research and get fishin' and it won't be long before you're laying a beat down on them.  Good Luck, UF"
340897,Fang,2009-05-13 01:24:00,1330,my guess is that they're smallies starting to climb the river. The credit is a good spawning river for lake smallmouth and it's about time they started to show up in the pools north of Dundas. Always hit a few when drifting for late steelehead end of May.
340987,MillerPhoto,2009-05-13 04:10:00,147,"I lived about 5 min away for the past 6 months, just moved back up to Colborne thou..  There is a nice stream that you can access down at the east end by Dixie Rd..  For those who do not know the area. when your on lakeshore heading east, just past Dixie Rd, on the right is a enterence to a public park area, before you go over the bridge, follow the road down and it will bring you to the mouth of the river, seen alot of guys fishing there mid April. Never stayed long enough to see anything caught thou."
341006,Kenny G,2009-05-13 11:19:00,118,Pretty sure it's Marie Curtis park Miller. Boat launch there to right? Kenny G.
341007,MSBruno,2009-05-13 11:21:00,369," after looking on google earth, I was actually at this stream.  It's on the west-most end of Lakefront promenade"
341025,Fang,2009-05-13 12:40:00,1330,"That would be Etobicoke Creek. Way back in the 70's when I was a wee lad I fished that creek from lake Ontario right up to Dundas. Every weekend in the summer I did the Tom Sawyer thing. Packed a sandwich in the morning and take my fishing rod down to the creek. Spend the whole day messing around. In all those years only saw a couple of wayward rainbows in the spring. Mostly chub, shiners and suckers. Down by the mouth at Marie Curtis you'll hit the odd bass but mostly carp"
341292,MillerPhoto,2009-05-14 02:53:00,147,"Thanks, yup that would be the one i'm refering to! )  Have you tried up at Humber Bay Park?? I know its not much further, I have went up there a few times to shoot photos. Looks like it would be prime for pike maybe???? Rockey bottom, weed patches...  Im defiantly going to have to get back up that way this summer thou! Try out some of the spots I never had a chance to.."
