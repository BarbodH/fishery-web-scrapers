I was thinking of going back and trying my luck for the pike that the conservation area's website says are in there. Does anyone have any experience on this lake? Any lures that were productive or areas that I should try? PM me if you would prefer, thank you."

Be prepared to catch a lot of OOS bass though. It was during on of these spring excursion for pike that we actually found an old dead guy floating in a back bay."
