I'm sure ice out was barelly a coupla weeks or so ago, weather's not looking so good for this weekend.  Was supposed to head up to Temiskaming Shores but decided against it.  Needs a good week of warmer temps for the pickeral action to start heating up.  Some good trouting around Charlton if you're in the area!  cheers HD"
