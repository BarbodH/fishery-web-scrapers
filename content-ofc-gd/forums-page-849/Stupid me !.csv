I'd be getting someone to weld a piece back on. Nope not riveted... the one place welding, and losing 30 to 40% strength of material, is allowed in my book ! lol"
341203,tinbanger,2009-05-13 23:40:00,1028,"I knew you would have something to say   I knew there were rocks I just didn't know they were so hard!  Actually the section missing start about 1 1/2"" up on the leading edge and tapers down towards the prop side .In fact the I don""t think amy material is missing from the side of the skeg next to the skeg. Maybe just hit it with some black spray paint  Maybe it'll make me faster too LOL  TB"

There are many models, some add some drag, you have to decide either sacrifce drag of your prop. My engine hits somethign at lest 3 times a year even if I am very careful, but the skeg protector has saved me from any damage to my skeg and prop"
