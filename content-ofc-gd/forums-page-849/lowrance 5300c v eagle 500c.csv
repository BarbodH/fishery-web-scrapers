341523,mistaredone,2009-05-14 20:53:00,913,I'm trying to decide between the lowrance 5300c and the eagle 500c. I know the eagle is a few years older and has a lower pixel screen but is it worth an extra $300 dollars for a new lowrance?  Anyone have either of these units?  I figure with the money saved I could pick up hot maps.
