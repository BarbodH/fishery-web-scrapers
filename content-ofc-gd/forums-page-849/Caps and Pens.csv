340794,Angler16,2009-05-12 22:35:00,188,Just wondering what people think on who will take the series. any cup predictions. Mine are Chicago Washington(if washing ton wins and beats Carolina)
340802,Lunker777,2009-05-12 22:52:00,866,Wings and Pens.... Re match from last year.... Same result though
340823,MCTFisher9120,2009-05-12 23:18:00,3761,I agree with Lunker except this year it's Pittsburgh's turn to win the Cup...going to be a exciting game tomorrow night!
340859,Angler16,2009-05-13 00:25:00,188,"I believe caps deserve it more, i cannot stand Crosby and they had their shot last year."
340862,holdfast,2009-05-13 00:27:00,1813,Best teams will be eliminated and Im afraid another Boring Pens and Detroit series.
340870,Marty,2009-05-13 00:41:00,873,I hope I get to watch the boring series.    Not so sure though.
340900,bucktail,2009-05-13 01:28:00,1857,The question is who will be fed to the wings again. I think its a Boston - Detroit original 6 final but I have a feeling it will be another Wings cup. How do pick anyone else?
340904,Angler16,2009-05-13 01:35:00,188,"I think carolina will win the series and take on the caps. Ovie will turn it on all the young guys like backstrom,semin and even older guys like ,federov, kozlov and clark. The key is Varlamov. If the Canes win this series i truly believe washington is the faster better team. When it comes to Chicago i honestly thing their young roster will Patty kane on fire and Byflugien in front of Osgood they will do ok. I dont want detroit to win it again."
340907,Daplumma,2009-05-13 01:41:00,1961,If the refs let the boys play tomorrow the Caps will have it.They have killed the Caps to a point that they are afraid to finish a check cause they will be penalized.I love my boys but this is not the year.Next year and the next few after they will be very stout.I do hope the Pens go down in flames cause I so love Marty. Joe
340910,jediangler,2009-05-13 01:44:00,1923,Original six sounds good to me.  Boston vs Chicago final.
340985,holdfast,2009-05-13 04:05:00,1813, Speak Canadian Plse.  Oh now what have I started.  Just kidding little fella.
340986,smokin joe,2009-05-13 04:08:00,226,I'm rooting for.......... nope not gonna do it cause I'll jinx it
341017,snoil,2009-05-13 12:07:00,139,Hawks over Ducks in 7. Caps over Bruins in 7. Hawks win cup in 6!
341214,goodtimer,2009-05-13 23:58:00,53,"5-0 after 2 periods....what a disappointment after such anticipation.  was such a thrilling series, gonna miss watchin ovi play.  oops - 5-1 now.  go caps go"
341215,Marty,2009-05-13 23:59:00,873,"Hmmmm.   Daplumma, how's things?"
341218,MCTFisher9120,2009-05-14 00:10:00,3761, Exciting indeed    Let's Go Pens!
341223,kickingfrog,2009-05-14 00:41:00,8333,"  That's one way to always be right.   I don't have a rooting interest, I was just hoping for some good hockey and maybe 3-4 overtimes. I don't think too many people would have predicted this after six pretty good games between these two teams.   Two more games tomorrow."
341226,Daplumma,2009-05-14 00:46:00,1961,I so hate you Marty.
341233,MCTFisher9120,2009-05-14 00:55:00,3761,Glad to see them win! I can't wait to see them again in the Stanley Cup final!
341260,Marty,2009-05-14 01:33:00,873,"I'll waive to you all from the Igloo.   Hey TJ, can you get me a black and gold OFC hat?"
341263,JohnF,2009-05-14 01:39:00,3494," Like him or not, he's setting a very high bar. Ask Ovechkin if you have any doubts. It's one thing to be a flash in the pan, albeit a bright and reasonably consistent flash, and a whole nuther world to be Crosby right now. He's proving that you don't have to be I'm Mr. Centre Of The Universe to win games for your team. I'm more and more impressed with him and his work ethic.  JF"
