I want to keep them in a small container and since they are dead is there a liquid i can put them in where they wont stink LOTS and start to rot in...something i can make around the house, or do i have to deal with the smell?  Thanks, MTBF"
341163,gone_fishin,2009-05-13 22:08:00,481,"did you salt them before freezing??? that usually helps with the smell, as they don't rot as fast when salted."
341168,Greencoachdog,2009-05-13 22:29:00,8163,"Make a brine solution with ice cream salt (rock salt) and ice, put some ice in an insulated container and pour some rock salt on top of it and stir.  This will keep your minnows nealy frozen and preserved with the salt, add more salt and ice as needed."
341171,Bob,2009-05-13 22:33:00,370,"Un-thawing?  Shouldn't that be un-freezing?     Just bury them in pickling salt.  It'll suck the moisture out of them and stop any bacterial action.  When you stick them on the hook and drop them in the lake, they'll reabsorb the lost moisture."
