We hit Couchiching for some gators!  We started the day off in about 12 feet of water throwing jerkbaits and big grubs.  We landed a bunch of long, skinny fish.  We moved onto some sand flats in 6-8 feet and got some better sized fish throwing flukes and flappin shads on 3/16oz jigheads.  We eventually made out way into a marina on Simcoe and landed a few more fish crawling the big grubs in the deeper pockets of the marina.  Any questions, PM me.

340829,danbouck,2009-05-12 23:27:00,4380,I don't quite know how to reply after that one  Nice Pike!
340860,Leecher,2009-05-13 00:26:00,7832,"Great report and pics Steve  Pike opener for us is this coming weekend and after seeing this report, can't wait any longer!!! Great jobs you guys and thanks for sharing Leechman"
340878,steverowbotham,2009-05-13 00:50:00,1800,"The bite was slow today, the jerkbait fish were caught on LONG pauses and the jig fish were all on a very slow drag/hop retrieve."
340882,solopaddler,2009-05-13 00:57:00,8605,"Nice job Steve. Not surprising how you caught them. My number one bait for shallow post spawn pike is a 4"" power leech on a light jighead. They suck it in like candy."
340891,ozaibak1,2009-05-13 01:16:00,401,"Nice report and results Steve considering a tough day. I noticed the tree in the side of the pictures, with the shade, that's always been a great producer of fish for me, regardless of the species! I find finding that nice shaded spot during the day gather quite a few of the smaller fish attracting the bigger predators in the area."
341123,steverowbotham,2009-05-13 18:58:00,1800," Generally I would say thats true, however at this time of year with the warming waters, the pike seem to spend more time sunning themselves"
341129,tinbanger,2009-05-13 19:11:00,1028,"Nice work ! and a great day to be out .  Our opener on Saturday was fairly prouctive ( untill the rain !) 8 smaller fish with one over 30"". The rain seemed to really shut them down .  will post a report later.  TB"
