Whatever issues there were appear to be resolved...but that doesn't mean we won't run into any new ones. The upgrade contains a full version set of changes and new features. There will be a completely revamped posting area with new junk for you guys to play wiht. Also you will able to embed YouTube or Google Video right into your posts. There is also a big component we are thinking of trying out. We'll see how the moderators vote on whether or not we can try and keep it effectively monitored. The new version also offers a huge personal profile area. This is especially of interest to guides and pros but will be very handy for everyone. You'll have a greatly enhanced Control Panel to set your preferences.  Issues I suspect will come up.. Stay tuned...there will also be some big news, some small news and some more big news."

25512,bigfish1965,2007-01-23 16:08:00,3382,No this is just software upgrading..not a new software system. Re-enlisting will never have to happen again.
