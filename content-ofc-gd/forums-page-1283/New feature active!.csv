This will create a 'Live Bookmark' on your browser (tested in Firefox and Opera...I don't know if it worrks in IE..but it should). This gives you a live an d continuos feed of the last 10 posts on the site refreshing every 15 minutes. I don't know if that is a decent refresh time or not, but we will soon see. This is very handy for dial-up members and for those at work needing a more 'discreet' interface to view the site. http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...rssout&id=1"
