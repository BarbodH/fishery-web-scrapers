25390,Gerritt,2007-01-23 02:40:00,6129,Sorry you were unable to respond to the thread you started. No hard feelings I hope. The Gods decided to close it.  Gerritt.
25400,lookinforwalleye,2007-01-23 03:12:00,4399,I can`t understand why a good discussion gets locked there was nothing rude or nasty just good discussion.
25401,ccmtcanada,2007-01-23 03:14:00,7971,Discussions like this typically go nowhere.  It was an opinion based thread...and not everyone has the same opinion...and it could lead to nasty comments later.  I dont think any more could have been added...it's all been said before and debated to death on here....there are still active threads on this topic.
25402,bigfish1965,2007-01-23 03:17:00,3382,The original topic is still open. There was no need to have two debates on the same idea especially when one had become a debate on the rules of other boards.
25403,Gerritt,2007-01-23 03:18:00,6129,it appears there was some things said that were not appropriate... although I never saw it and I was keeping up to date on the thread often.... the offending remarks were removed and the post locked... that was the explaination I received...  However I was also informed the original thread is still ongoing and available for discussion... although for how long I am not sure.... but your right things seem to be different as of late....  Gerritt.
25420,Bojangles,2007-01-23 04:14:00,46,"I don't even feel like going on further.. and for those who sent me PM's and understood my side of the story, thanks, you guys know who you are. Some people here just jump to assumptions and take things down the other side of the road. I could babble on.. but Im not gonna do that..  Releasing steel..  "
25438,snag,2007-01-23 04:57:00,1932,Both of you are gentlemen.
25459,huey graphite,2007-01-23 12:51:00,362,That's an incredible looking release shot. I gotta get out fishing!
25477,Mike Pike,2007-01-23 14:29:00,1332,"That's a terrific release shot, Bojangles.  Could you please tell me exactly where you're fishing?  lol"
25481,Joey,2007-01-23 14:38:00,9122, Good one Mike!  Thanks for the chuckle this morning.  Joey
25678,Bojangles,2007-01-23 22:39:00,46,"Thats how fish should be taken care of. They shouldn't be all over in the mud unless they aren't going to be released.  Cheers,   Bojangles"
25681,Pinch,2007-01-23 22:45:00,231, Wow you must be the guy nick named Happy.  Cant you just accept the compliment without critisizing or having a dig at other people??
25697,Bojangles,2007-01-23 23:12:00,46,I don't know what you mean by happy.. Im looking at being more 'ethical'.
25706,Pinch,2007-01-23 23:24:00,231," By Happy I mean you sound miserable, like calling a fat guy slim or a bald guy curly.  There were two people giving you a compliment and one person saying sorry, and all you can do is be critical of other people.  Surely instead of making a snide comment you could have just said thanks or appology accepted or something similar."
