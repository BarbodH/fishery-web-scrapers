24465,pikehunter,2007-01-20 13:50:00,1659,Great news!  Glad to hear you are progressing along. Before you know it you will be back to work and will be wondering where the time went.

24481,Carp,2007-01-20 14:57:00,1488,"That's the kind of news we like to hear Charles.  Seems like you healed up pretty quick, but I know there's still a lot of healing left.  I broke a vertibrae in my spine a few years ago and took at least 1 year to heal enough to say it was O.K, but it will never be 100% again.  Wish you all the best with the recovery bud."
24552,Loonietoon,2007-01-20 19:25:00,1450,
24573,Whopper,2007-01-20 20:03:00,2174,Great news Big Congrats!
24582,steverowbotham,2007-01-20 20:19:00,1800,"I'll PM you when the ice is thick enough.  It's funny, I fish a minimum of 100 days a year.  90% of those days, I'm bass fishing.  But, I still have never caught a whitefish!  I've gone out to Simcoe, dropped spreaders, Badd Boyz, Half and Halfs, all I ever catch are lakers !!"
24627,wuchikubo,2007-01-20 22:18:00,1114,"Great news Chuck, sounds like you're making good progress, but remember to take it easy as you (and probably everyone else here) don't want you to do anything that will set things backwards.  I'll get on that Free guided list! (if there's safe ice)  Take good care, Stan"
24654,Garyv,2007-01-21 00:02:00,547,"Great to hear your making progress.  Should you decide to go just be careful out on the ice, the last thing you need to do now is fall!"
24660,tjsa,2007-01-21 00:15:00,1578,"Fantastic news Chuck, hope everything continues to improve for you. Wish I was living down there now, so you could guide me to those whitefish hotspots. We have a few areas up here that offer that resource, I just haven't taken advantage of the opportunities yet.  One of these days, will try for 'em. Lakers up here I know well."
24663,TJQ,2007-01-21 00:21:00,7806,Ya... but Chuck.. I can still take you.... lol
24778,joonmoon,2007-01-21 05:44:00,528,"Good news Chuck, I'm recovering from a spinal injury too. I have been 1 1/2 years out of work and will be returning in a week or so. Take your time to heal even if you feel really good it could be a false sence of security and you can reinjure weak tissue quite easily so take your time. Fresh air, and fishin should really help. Physio and stretching will take time but will help. Good luck and I too would like to be added to the free guide list. I'll be in touch when its good."
24806,cisco,2007-01-21 13:36:00,597,"Makes my day to hear the great progress report! Maybe during the next week or two we can get together. GT and Chuckles have been buggin me re your recovery status.  I'll lettem know and maybe we can all go drown some worms on Simcoe together!  Hey TJ, I bet Big Chev has pushed bigger guys than you out of the way TO GET INTO A GOOD FIGHT!"
24807,Terry,2007-01-21 13:44:00,14456,good to hear Chuck  I'm sure  I will see you out there fishing a few times this year
24816,Joey,2007-01-21 14:11:00,9122,"Great new Chuck.  Now remember, with the brace off now, don't tick Shelley off, she can choke you now  Now if you could just pray for some more ice, we'd all be set.  Cheers.  Joey"
24821,OhioFisherman,2007-01-21 14:16:00,6623,"Great news Chuck, don`t rush it though."
