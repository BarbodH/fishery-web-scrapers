25565,steverowbotham,2007-01-23 18:18:00,1800,"I've caught both smallmouth and largemouth through the ice.  Last year I got a 16 inch largemouth on the first weekend in March, got it on a live minnow while fishing for pike.  The next day, while fishing for perch on Simcoe, in 39 fow, I hooked what I thought was a whitefish, but ended up being a 19.5 inch smallmouth.  Got her on a 1/32 oz teardrop and maggots."
