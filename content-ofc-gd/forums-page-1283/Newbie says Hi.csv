My name is Frank and I live near Cambridge.  My wife and two teenage girls like to boat/fish while we're on summer holidays and I'm chomping at the bit to get out ice fishing in Long Point.  Thanks eveyone for all of the tips on....well just about everything and I hope I can drop the odd pic from time to time.  O yeah and the name Frankypro- it's not because I'm a pro at fishing, it's from the computer Golf game Links 386 years ago.   When you played against the computer to practice you always played a "" pro "" Hence Frankypro was born."
