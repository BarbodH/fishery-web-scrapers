The real challenge for me is trying to catch walleye. I pay for access to these lakes in summer.  If the ice gets thick enough to be safe, I will be attempting to ice fish near Perth. I have a truck(but not a 4x4) and a sled to hold my ice fishing gear. The access points that I pay for in summer are not good access points for ice fishing.  I want to be able to obtain access to Christie, Bennett and Crosby lakes for ice fishing this season. Does anyone have a property which is accessible in the winter and is willing to allow me access(I will pay for access) ?   Len"
