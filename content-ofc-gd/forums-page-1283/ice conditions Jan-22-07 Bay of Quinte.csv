Point-Anne is still very scary and so is Massassauga point. Big bay has the best ice along with Herkimer.  Pete’s Point has a huge pressure crack that is taking its time to seal up so watch it guys and gals. We now have a solid 6 inches at Big Bay and a solid 5 at Herkimer and Potter’s creek. Even though we have this thickness does not mean that it’s those measurements all-over the place, caution still needs to be used. It’s really looking like this coming weekend is going to be a go. I still will not recommend it safe for all those that want to go out. I’m getting a lot of good reports to-day from many different reliable sources but they are with the same feelings I have.(CAUTION NEEDS TO BE A PRIORITY) As far as fish go big bay seems to be the most consistent area Herkimer is a close second. Potters seems to be on one day then off the next. Not a lot of reports from Pete’s Point. Hopefully the forecast holds true and we have our cold weather all week. Remember be safe and use caution if you must take your chance. ………Ron"
