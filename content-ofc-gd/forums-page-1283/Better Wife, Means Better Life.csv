Does it really exist? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFgQlRuHpGg...ted&search=   Marriage....What I've Learned  I've come to understand that love is entirely a matter of chemistry. That must be why my wife treats me like toxic waste.  When a man steals your wife, there is no better revenge than to let him keep her.  By all means marry. If you get a good wife, you'll be happy. If you get a bad one, you'll become a philosopher.  Woman inspires us to great things, and prevents us from achieving them.  The great question... which I have not been able to answer.... ""What does a woman want?  I had some words with my wife, and she had some paragraphs with me.  ""Some people ask the secret of our long marriage. We take time to go to a restaurant two times a week. A little candlelight, dinner, soft music and dancing. She goes Tuesdays, I go Fridays.""  ""I don't worry about terrorism. I was married for two years.""  ""There's a way of transferring funds that is even faster than electronic banking. It's called marriage.""  ""I've had bad luck with both my wives. The first one left me, and the second one didn't.""  Two secrets to keep your marriage brimming. Whenever you're wrong, admit it. Whenever you're right, shut up.  You know what I did before I got married? Anything I wanted to.  My wife and I were happy for twenty years. Then we met.  A good wife always forgives her husband when she's wrong.  Marriage is the only war where one sleeps with the enemy.  I once inserted an 'ad' in the classifieds: ""Wife wanted"". Next day I received a hundred letters. They all said the same thing: ""You can have mine.""  A buddy once said to me ""My wife's an angel!"" I said ""You're lucky, mine's still alive.""  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Beauty Of A Woman  The beauty of a woman, isn't in the clothes she wears, The figure that she carries, or the way she combs her hair.  The beauty of a woman, must be seen from in her eyes Because that's the doorway to her heart, the place where love resides.  The beauty of a woman, isn't in a facial mole, but true beauty in a woman, is reflected by her soul.  It's the caring that she cares to give, the passion that she shows, And the beauty of a woman, with passing years, only grows."

24834,Bob,2007-01-21 15:10:00,370,Milady says she wouldn't marry me if I was the last man on earth. She tried marriage once and it didn't work. I've tried it twice and it didn't work either time. Milady and I have been together now for nearly 16 years and we're still best friends.  She backs me up in every endeavour and we seldom trade a cross word. Doesn't get any better than that.  I should also mention that she loves fishing and often pushes me to go if I'm having a lazy day.
