By the end there was 5-6""in the bay area and made it nice to access the ice with the sled's. Will be back on the 25th till 28th for the anual Ice Guy Adventure Trip yahoooo! Hope you like the pic's of the gang/fish. Pauly     "

25137,tonyb,2007-01-22 15:37:00,1637,"Hey Mr. Twister, great report.  I was wondering if you could share some information about the bait situation?  Were you able to get live minnows up there?  I know with the bait ban now in effect I have been warned by the operator we booked with in Temagami that they have no access to live minnows?!!  Thanks in advance. Tony"
25167,Clampet,2007-01-22 16:49:00,1947," Great report fellas. Now y'all got everyone rarin' to go.  Minnows are available if you go to the right place. We were able to get shiners in Sturgeon Falls where we fished, at $5.00 / dozen."
25192,Mr Twister,2007-01-22 18:19:00,71,"As for the minnow situation up there,there was some bait shops around the area that had some.Make arrangements before you head up I would sudgest!Good Luck......Twister"
25207,GbayGiant,2007-01-22 18:47:00,1780,"Nice fish. Just currious, do some people call those lings dog fish ? cause I've seen some huge ones before that looked like that ling picture and my grandfather told me they were dog fish."
25347,Spiel,2007-01-23 01:04:00,9065,".....Hey, now there's a couple of familiar faces. Good to see (and read) that you all had a good time."
