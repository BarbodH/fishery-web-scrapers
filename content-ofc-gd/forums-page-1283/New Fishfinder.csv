It's a pretty decent unit and was much cheaper at LeBaron's for $268 and change, at BPS, it was $319.99. It takes 8 D-cell batteries or a 12 Gel-cell. I stuffed it with the D's and have played around with it. It's a nice unit that should meet my needs, whether they be a boat rental or HOPEFULLY, a fly-in trip this summer. For the money, it's great and on fish-finder-review.com, it's considered an absolute best buy in LCD fishfinders. So, I'll break it in hopefully on the Muskoka river on May 2-4 weekend fishing for Pike at my buddie's cottage. That is, if the wife and kiddies let me sneak out for a couple of days."

25653,Smokey,2007-01-23 21:36:00,1278,"Congrats on the new unit. I was checking it out on LB's site, It should do you well. Once you learn how to get the most out of it with the features you'll love it. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the lowrance/eagle products.  Good Luck with it."
