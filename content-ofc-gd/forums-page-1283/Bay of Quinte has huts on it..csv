Our staff and pro-staff have been out fishing everyday now for a few days and reporting in on conditions. The ice is in good shape and has been for at least 4-5 days now. Today was also a good sign on the bay when Fish Finder Charters placed his huts out on the Bay. AS soon as I am in tomorrow morning at our store I will get the information that Fish Finders Charters has left on our counter and make available to everyone here.  Best regards, Sam"

25436,BLACKFISH88,2007-01-23 04:48:00,191,I walked out yesterday myself in belleville and there were no huts only one crazy guy with a portable that had gone over a big pressure crack and was between another one few feet away. Where on BOQ are these huts located. I seen about 5 inches of ice where people were fishing just wondering if it was a different location Sam.
