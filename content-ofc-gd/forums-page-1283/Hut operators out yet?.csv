25480,Spiel,2007-01-23 14:31:00,9065,....I've heard some are on ice or soon will be in the Pefferlaw area Tony. I'm heading up there Sunday with a group of 47 and we have huts booked for the day. Thought it was going to be cancelled but the operator called to say his huts are going out and will be ready for the weekend.  Quinte

25490,tonyb,2007-01-23 15:07:00,1637,Holy crap 47 Spiel?!  Who did you rent from? Sounds like a blast.  With 15KM winds and -5 temps it might be nicer in the shelter of a hut for the day.  Tony

25698,Beans,2007-01-23 23:14:00,3339,Sounds like Pefferlaw Fish Huts to me Spiel...used to book with them until my No 1 grandson reached the age of 12 yrs old (then I was charged full price for him)...  It made the day too expensive so we bought our own auger and built a couple of wind shelters...  Sure miissed those great breakfasts in the dining room though and the great hamburgers Jerry would bring out to us at noon hour...  I'm sure you will enjoy their service...
