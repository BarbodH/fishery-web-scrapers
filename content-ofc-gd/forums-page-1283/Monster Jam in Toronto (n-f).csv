25010,Carp,2007-01-22 04:11:00,1488,"I attended the MONSTER JAM show at the Rogers Center today.  My two oldest (5 & 7) are crazy for these monster trucks. When they first started mentioning the Monster Jam show was on T.V, I thought it was some sort of cartoon.  It was a good time watching (and hearing) these powerful machines. I couldn't believe the decibal level. It was probably as loud a rock concert, but the noise just wasn't as consistent. Some kids had hearing protection on. Didn't help that we had front row seats and were about as close as fans could get.  I managed a few pics, but the dust and smoke makes them look a little fuzzy. Oh yeah. A couple were just due to being a dorky photographer.  This is one monster truck called Superman.      .....and the fan favourite Grave Digger.          The driver was O.K. His name is Randy Brown.    We met Randy at an autograph signing in Mississauga last Thursday. Nice guy. He signed a couple of souvenier pictures and I snapped a couple of pics of him with the kids, but the high resolution I used doesn't allow me to load them on this site. I'm not very good at re-sizing.  Well, that was my Sunday afternoon. Much better than working on ""the list."""
25014,Gerritt,2007-01-22 04:28:00,6129,carp cool report! glad to hear the kidlets had a blast!! wicked...  want a simple way to resize pics?? Use Windows paint!!!! LOL sounds stupid I know... Use the Stretch/Skew function... 50x50 usually does the job... Be sure to use the SAVE AS function afterwards.   again cool non-fishing report!  Gerritt.
25019,Carp,2007-01-22 04:57:00,1488,"Thanks for the info Gerritt. I'll see if I can figure it out, but right now, the bed is cold and waiting for me to warm it up."
25035,canadian_copper,2007-01-22 10:31:00,925,WAS THERE TOO WITH LITTLE C !!! WAS A GREAT SHOW BUT DUMMY ME FORGOT THE CAMERA!!!!LOL OH WELL NEXT YR!!!LOL
25043,motv8tr,2007-01-22 12:20:00,2587,My Nephew took his two year old son on Sunday...I imagine they had a blast as the little guy loves all trucks....i just hope his hearing was damaged  Maureen
25055,dsn,2007-01-22 13:11:00,1018,Great action shots. Carp. Too bad the show is only on for 2 days. Would have loved to check it out too.
25061,Sherriff,2007-01-22 13:18:00,252,"I went Saturady with my son, my brother and his kids.   Was my first time.  It was a blast.  The kids loved it.  Amazing the beating these trucks can take..  We had a pit pass before the show and we could get down on the floor and get a closer look at the trucks etc.  I am still amazed at the idiot adults pushing kids outta the way so they can get a picture of the suspension or engine of the trucks.  I like trucks as much as anyone but come on, budding in front of a 4 year old so you can touch a truck.  Give me a break.  I think Guinness World Records should stop by for the largest collection of mullets and plaid shirts in one place....  Still a great time... Sherriff"
25149,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-22 16:03:00,0,Great stuff Remo.  I took my boys the previous 2 years and they enjoyed it. It's good value for the money.
25321,Carp,2007-01-23 00:12:00,1488,"I knew it would be near impossible to take a decent picture with the kids if we got down to the stadium level to check out the trucks.  That's why I didn't bother, but rather went to Parts Source in Mississauga to see the truck and driver.  There were a few people hanging around, but we had opportunities to take as many pictures as we wanted with the truck. Inside, the Grave Digger driver, Randy Brown, signed personalized free souvenier pictures of the truck for the kids and jumped out of his seat in an instant when asked if we could get a photo with him. Very accomodating and seems like a genuine ""nice guy.""  My right ear took a beating yesterday. The trucks were loud, but the kids behind me leaning forward and screaming just inches from my ear is what did the real damage. I think I might have some permanent hearing loss. The right ear has been kinda funny all day. Might have to go see our bud hearingfish and get it checked out."
