There was 7 to 8"" of ice where we are, but a large number of pressure cracks, there is a large wet spot right near shore, but it's only 1 ft deep there.   Good Luck to all.   Entropy"

25657,Smokey,2007-01-23 21:41:00,1278,"Thanks for the report. With the cold lately looks like we might get a bit of a season after all. Great pics Thanks and better luck next time.  I'm with you on Patb's avatar, everytime I see it I crack up."
25755,PatB,2007-01-24 00:27:00,104,"Entropy, this is a long shot, but you mention Veiw Lake thats the area I fish, A buddy of mine lives up there, Peter Bostelman, just wanted to know if you have ever ran into him? He has lived up there all his life, did guiding, tourny's and raced his snow machine a few years back. As I said long shot....  Smokey, I'm up at Youngs Point a lot from walleye opening to closing in November, if you are into a little walleye or musky fishing when the time get's a little closer let me know, I'll send you a map. The venison and crab legs are on me.  Sorry guy's to go off topic a bit, I'll add some reports as soon as I can get on the ice."
15173,ecmilley,2006-12-22 17:29:00,2163,think i might just trade the sled in for a jet ski and a good wet suit
15176,Entropy,2006-12-22 17:32:00,747,"Ya, it might be a good idea.  I was starting to plan on saving some money for next fall to buy a good sled, but ..... it might not be worth it."
15314,Fang,2006-12-23 02:15:00,1330,I think I might launch the boat at Port Perry on the 1st and drift in front of Goreskis.

Some slush beyond that.   I'm sure there is some ice in non-windy areas of the lake, but not enough to venture out on.   Scugog Fire and Rescue issued a public warning this week to stay off the ice.   Loading the boat up, or not, or ... I don't know what to do.??  Entropy"
21438,fishnsled,2007-01-11 18:56:00,3520,Thanks for the heads up.  I heard on the radio this morning the warnings go out.   DO NOT GO ON THE ICE AS IT IS NOT SAFE!!!  Another week of the cold temps and there might be a few areas to get out on.  Be safe everyone!
21447,mattyk,2007-01-11 19:21:00,2110,I agree with bill and jedi. I think they should close the ice fishing on the Bog.
21450,Entropy,2007-01-11 19:32:00,747,  Close Simcoe too.  Much presure and still open.

So, a total of 3"" of ice, but like I said that top 1"" did nothing but sluff off when tapped.  As of last night it was a no go for walking out (for me).

Popped a few holes in, didn’t get anything, but then again I was only in 2.3 to 3 ft of water with no weeds or structure around. After you scrape the snowy slush off the top there was only 2"" of clear ice, didn’t really want to venture out to “the spot” yet. Saw a guy touring the shoreline on a new Skidoo. Let’s hope for some thickness for this weekend.   F.N. & SHR I might not be able to make it out Sunday morning, I have a house warming to go to at my “Best Man’s” house Saturday evening, might not even see Sunday morn. Lol,   I saw another guy out near where I was, had a floater suit on, great idea, he was out always. I’ll have to invest in one for next year. He didn’t appear to be catching much, maybe a few perch if anything. Had my FRS radio on CH 19 nobody out there from here.   As for Sunday Morning, I might (“might”) be up and at it. Where are you guys thinking of meeting up? View Lake ?? If I’m alive I’ll head over, have a radio on so I can find you guys.   Awww, this house warming thing is becoming a bit of a thorn, might have to call it an early night, heck it will cost me the evening bite and morning bite, that’s a lot of fishing time to lose.   I’ll be out Friday evening, within 300 feet of shore, and a buddy of mine is coming down for Saturday morning. I’ll have my FRS on ...   Entropy"

Walked out 100' drilled 3 holes along the way, there was anywhere between 4"" to 5"", however 25% of that was white ice.  I will be out (after first confirming the ice is safe of course), Friday evening, Saturday and some of Sunday.  Play it safe, check often, be able to float, have picks, a rope, and a partner.

When I stepped out on to the ice it definitely cracked under me.  Stay off. Danger.  It was so warm last night I was only wearing a t-shirt when chopping fire wood.  The driveway was more than a little mushy, it has defrosted!  I asked my neighbor 2 questions.  #1 Do you think this ice will melt? Answer –> No, not completely.  #2 When do you think it will be safe to venture out onto the lake? Answer –> Sometime during the first 2 weeks of January.  At lest we are not complaining about shoveling the snow.  I actually thought about throwing some grass seed down, with the next 5 days being warm and wet, it would likely sprout.  18 Days 13.5 Hours  Entropy  Waiting for the ice this year is like watching grass grow .....

11750,misfish,2006-12-13 18:42:00,29133," Bill,what do you mean? Since there is a chance of an accidental hook up with a musky you would not fish the BOG?  We up here have the same chance of doing this on Couch,but still fish it.Hooks are too small to even worry about hurting the big guys.  Just my 2 cents.   I,ll be out on the bog once this year.Friendly  meet up with some of the byes."

11954,MuskyBill,2006-12-14 02:29:00,311,"The chances of hooking Smallies on Cook's Bay through the ice just doesn't compare to the chances of hooking a Musky on Scugog through the ice.  I know of LOTS of Muskies that were caught or broken off ice fishing Scugog, BUT I can only think of ONE report where someone actually caught a Smallie, & it was on Simcoe, not Cook's.  For me, it's not worth the aggravation, so I'll avoid it.  Personally, I don't think Scugog should have an ice season, but that's another topic, & MY opinion."
