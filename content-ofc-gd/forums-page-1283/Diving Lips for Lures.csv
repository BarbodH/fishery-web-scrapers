24058,muskiesRus,2007-01-19 02:31:00,18,Do any of you luremaking type guys have a source for stainless diving lips [muskie bait size]? I was talking to Real Pro Luremaking today-they don't have them and can't get them-in fact she asked that if I found a source for them to let her know. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I have several lures just sitting there waiting for lips. THANKS!!!

An order of 50 to 100  will keep you going for a while,,,cost is still cheaper than buyin them..... AND more satisfying.  "
