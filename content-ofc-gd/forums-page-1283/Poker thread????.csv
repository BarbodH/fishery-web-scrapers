25610,Gerritt,2007-01-23 20:15:00,6129,"I think the boys are making a very valid argument and are doing so with tact. I would also like to add I agree with Terry on this one. We have both been long standing members, members that saw this thing grow and grow and i like to think in a way helped build it to what it is today, and told our friends about it who in turn told thier friends etc.. and it is a shame when something you loved to do (chat on OFC) changes in a manner which alot of us view something less then it once was... Money can ruin a great many friendships... One man started this thing built it to what it was and made a livelihood from it and because of circumstances is backing away... now we have many men running the show and we are now talking about Incorporating this thing we all hold near and dear to our hearts with a select few members as the CEO and CFO and CIO and Chief legal counsel..  This place used to be about Community now it seem it is about the almighty dollar with many hands in the pot.  With the exception of ""He who shall not be named"" there were not a ton of posts that were edited killed or deleted back in the day...  Alot of the people using these forums will say so what? those people also have not been here 5 or 6+ years watching it grow and dont really now any better then what they have right now before their eyes.  I understand things will never go back to the way they were.. we have grown just to large for that... but perhaps you guys can ease up a touch? and let that sense of brotherhood continue?  I did not write this to slam any of the mods or the corporate owners or whoever else is running the show... just expressing what I as an individual sees feels and understands.  Gerritt."
25618,Spiel,2007-01-23 20:30:00,9065,"....There has always been loads of posts deleted, nuked, locked or whatever on all previous boards. For some reason it always becomes an issue when it's ""your"" posts being nuked, yes that's right it's ""what happened to my post?"" wah!!  It's a message board, not much has changed imo other than you all need to get out fishing."
25619,Daplumma,2007-01-23 20:30:00,1961,"Gerrit,If i read it correctly a while back the owner was making 1% of his income from the site and was taking up a large percentage of his time.I have been here for a long time also and yes the place has changed,some ways for the better and some ways for the worse.If the guys want to incorporate and make a go at it I will support them.I hope they do well.I have met all of the mods here,as have you ,and can say they are all top notch guys and would not hesitate to help them in any way I could just as they would do the same for you or me.They are not a faceless mega corperation but a few guys trying to make this thing work out.Just my thoughts on this subject. Joe"

25187,Harrison,2007-01-22 18:00:00,2202, no longer OFC.  Its OFC
25190,bigfish1965,2007-01-22 18:02:00,3382,"Before someone falls off their high horse and breaks a hip...let me explain what is going on. Online poker is illegal in the US now (Jan 01/07 under new Homeland Security Bill). We are hosted by an American company. So while having a discussion publicly about poker is fine, having a direct link (either physically or by use of the OFC name) may be a violation of our terms of service. Until we can get a legal opinion on it, we have placed the thread in an area that is not visible. (Online poker is also technically not legal in Canada, but falls under the 'stuff we'll never enforce' area) As you will notice in your terms of service, any question as to reasons for a thread being pulled are to be done by PM."
25191,Spiel,2007-01-22 18:14:00,9065,"....Actually I believe it was pulled for a number of reasons. But mostly because it had been discussed among the Admins that we do not want the registered and privately owned OFC name associated with online gambling. The use of the name was never sought nor was permission given to use it. As for swills, well it is an opportunity for board members to get together and meet with others for the purpose of talking fishing over a few beers (or not) which of course makes it entirely fishing related. To that extent posts looking to get board members together for the purpose of talking fishing over a few cold ones will still be found from time to time.  While I personally am not interested in online gambling at least one Mod has expressed interest in playing is onside with keeping it off the board and discussed via e-mail or PM's. While I personally didn't pull the thread and don't know who did (or care) I support it's removal as do all the Mods."

25218,RobHall,2007-01-22 19:08:00,261,"It was no surprise to me, when i realized the ""poker"" thread was removed.  This type of thing is best handled via PM's.  I do not like to see underage gambling in any way, shape or form and posting a thread about an online gambling event, would most certainly attract many peeps under the age of 18....especially on a fishing forum like OFC.  I know there were a few who were interested.  Anyone needing the date, time and password for this event....just shoot me a PM.  There is already 7 registered.  18 or over please!!

25226,charlesn,2007-01-22 19:15:00,551,"Rick,  As I understand it, on-line poker was not banned in the US.  The funding of on-line poker accounts however was made very difficult for US citizens.  However, there are still ways to do so albeit not so simple as a few mouse clicks any more.  In an attempt to discourage or kill on-line poker in the US, they went after the funding mechanism as opposed to the sites themselves.  It makes sense for them though, not as much for us here.  In the states, they TAX gambling winnings.  Something that was impossible to do on web-sites.  Here the gov't does not, so there is less reason to ram through any legislation.  I can find out if the name can be changed, just wanted something that could be recognized by the people here.  Charles"
25230,RobHall,2007-01-22 19:21:00,261," Thats a good idea.  Just shoot a quick email to support and ask them to change the name.  I'm sure they can do it.  Maybe change it to one of your earlier suggestions...""The Angler Assassins"" Poker Tournament.  fishinonthebrain "

25312,Carp,2007-01-22 23:53:00,1488,"I respect the decision to pull the thread. We should be doing this by e-mail/pm's.  We have to understand and respect the heads of state not wanting the OFC name associated with this kind of thing. That's cool. Doesn't mean it can't happen at all. I wouldn't want to be involved in anything that could jeopardize the future of this site. It's a lot of work to create and maintain the OFC and our governing body has the right to be concerned for the reasons mentioned.  Fishinonthebrain seems to be taking the bull by the horns on this one, so send him you e-mails and pm's as he has requested. We can have a decent game of cards without ruffling feathers."
