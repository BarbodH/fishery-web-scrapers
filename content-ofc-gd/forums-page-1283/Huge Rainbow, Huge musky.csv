25560,jason27fish,2007-01-23 18:12:00,90,that has to be the biggest musky that i have ever seen
25029,GbayGiant,2007-01-22 06:37:00,1780,"I'm sure some people seen this rainbow, but I think it's worth lookin at again.       And this huge 61"" musky was caught and released near the same area just north of my fishing grounds. I need to find some of these next year, I know there out there, now it's the ofners time to reel some in.  "
25034,Greencoachdog,2007-01-22 07:01:00,8163,I'd like to see a measuring tape on that Mucksie.
25051,Gerritt,2007-01-22 12:49:00,6129,Thanks for the info!  something just doesnt look right with that muskie pic....  Gerritt
25053,Crazyhook,2007-01-22 13:01:00,1154,beauty fish!
25056,mepps,2007-01-22 13:14:00,1301,wow!  very impressive!
25062,Clampet,2007-01-22 13:20:00,1947, The anglers' top hand grip seems outta proportion to the distance from his face.
25066,Roy,2007-01-22 13:25:00,13728,"Ya, and the muskie seems out of proportion too! It's way too big. Congrats."
25071,glen,2007-01-22 13:32:00,2641,The only thing wrong with the muskie pic is that it aint me in it.
25095,1leggedangler,2007-01-22 14:16:00,364,"I noticed that too, seems to me it would be more of a struggle to get a grip on that beast then the way he seems to be holding it. Nice fish though.  Cheers, 1leg"
25116,mattyk,2007-01-22 15:05:00,2110,Those are some sweet lookin fish.
25155,lew,2007-01-22 16:20:00,12767,"Just once it'd be nice to see someone post a picture of a huge musky without all the ""experts"" picking it apart.  No wonder so many folks don't post their pics anymore.....me included."
25157,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-22 16:26:00,0,Both nice looking fish.  Really like that ski !!!
25159,wuchikubo,2007-01-22 16:29:00,1114,"Great pics John, those are some huge fish!"
25166,mason05,2007-01-22 16:43:00,258, Good point Lew. You try to share something and others see the need to scrutinize it. Just enjoy the photos and keep the opinions to yourselves. Nice Musky!  Corn Nug
25169,silveradosheriff,2007-01-22 16:53:00,1025,"Hey Lew, that's getting dangerously close to a vertical hold for the dog.  :-)"
25172,Peter Panfish,2007-01-22 16:57:00,46,That muskies just ridiculous.
25193,GbayGiant,2007-01-22 18:21:00,1780," I know what  you mean, and it looks legit to me, plus the angler released it and wasn't looking for any attention any way, and the rainbow is allot more outta proportion if you ask me, but no ones questioning that ?  Anyway Lew, we believe you   don't stop showing us those beauty fish."
25317,fishindevil,2007-01-23 00:07:00,6254,"well they sure are huge   fish either way i have seen both fish before,and the rainbow is waiting to be certified for the record books,and that ski is a mighty big fish ....kinda gives ya cabin fever eh????"
25320,Gerritt,2007-01-23 00:12:00,6129,My reply was in no way meant to be negative LOL... I figured that the photoshop thread going on etc that it might have been a bit humourous.... guess not..  Gerritt.
25326,GbayGiant,2007-01-23 00:21:00,1780,"No worries Gerrit, it's hard to tell when people are kidding or not because people have been questioning the size of muskies since the very first one posted on the net.  You would need a certified scale, tape measure, 100 pictures from every angle and a holly priest fishing with you to confirm the size if you wanted people to believe you."
25331,camillj,2007-01-23 00:35:00,1988,I fish GB ALOT .. and I can vouch for girls that big and even bigger in there ... now getting them aboard .. thats another matter .... all I can say is WOW ... nice fish.
25334,silveradosheriff,2007-01-23 00:42:00,1025,Maybe two holly priests.
25345,GbayGiant,2007-01-23 01:03:00,1780,"Wow that's a pig, nice fish. Lemmy guess, 54.34334"" + 26.7564756"" = 51.947578573846738473875 LBs. Could be off by a few due to the camera angle and lense type. LOL."
25384,Puckhead,2007-01-23 02:31:00,377,"WOW! that's one big @ss musky...  Seem the rainbow before, looks like it inhaled a football..."
25520,Cookslav,2007-01-23 16:35:00,1457,"That rainbow is a freak of nature! I saw the pictures in the paper when it was caught....A little jealous am I.  I think they confirmed it as an farmed escapee, but who cares....if thats what the escapees become I say let em all go!  That Ski is a beauty as well...definatley took advantage of the ""length pose"" but again...who cares you can tell how big and beautifull it is regardless.  Again...jealous am I"
