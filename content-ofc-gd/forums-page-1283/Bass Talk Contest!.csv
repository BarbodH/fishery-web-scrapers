21699,motv8tr,2007-01-12 11:40:00,2587," JP I would love to go, but I'd likely only go to the one in Vaughn, I do enough driving as it is  . As for work, well ya I think I work too much     , but I do work weekends, my days off are during the week.  Good luck to everyone who enters, and don't forget to take notes for the rest of us  Welcome aboard Dave  maureen"
21778,JPD,2007-01-12 18:44:00,296,"Maureen, you are the lucky one. I used to have weekdays off and loved every minute of it. All of the fishing spots had little to no pressure and traffic was better since I would always be going against the grain.  Nothing beats seeing the look on peoples faces when you are headed out with a boat hooked up and they are headed into work!!!  JP"
25528,David Chong,2007-01-23 16:50:00,836,"Thanks for the warm welcome! We are going to do the draw Mon. Jan. 29th and announce the winner!

Cheers, Dave"
