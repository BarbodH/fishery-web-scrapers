If you want yer soup hot, you have to heat it there.  Do you  grill sardines too?  What's a pork smokie?  Inquiring minds need to know."

25446,misfish,2007-01-23 11:02:00,29133,"  Yep we (the mrs,s and I)were like that.We would fish during the night hours at Chubbs fish huts off of hwy 48.Get yer minds out of the gutters.  . Then one night, one of those real cold ones,a crack lets loose that shaked the bejeezerrs out of the hut. Yep,that cured that problem. I do ask just so she feels wanted,but the answer is always NO.   She likes the warm days on the boat instead."
25449,Big Cliff,2007-01-23 11:17:00,6899,"I feel your pain misfish  Roy, last time I asked Sue if she thought I should go ice fishing or stay in bed and cuddle she just said ""dress warm sweetie""..... Sue never was a morning person LOL."
25499,fishdawg,2007-01-23 15:21:00,912,"For sure!  I dunno what it is, but I love my icefishing - like Terry it said , for almost all of the province for a coupla months, its the only game in town  as other have touched on, ice fishing can more of a social thing. I find people (complete strangers) are much more friendlier this time of year.  Gotta love a hot coffee in the portable hut & soft hypnotic hummming of the Vex & perch on the floor"
25508,Greencoachdog,2007-01-23 15:51:00,8163,  Yer killin' me FD!
25513,Cookslav,2007-01-23 16:16:00,1457,  Your wives are warm? My wife's feet are always 2 degrees below zero on a normal day I swear. And if I've been out with the boys the night before... I tell you...she's Dam cold Maybe its time I start Ice fishing?
25545,steverowbotham,2007-01-23 17:52:00,1800,"I used to hate ice fishing, until I invested in a floater suit, now I feel safe and warm !  To me, ice fishing doesnt compare to open water bass fishing, but it does help me to get through the winter and at least into May when pike and walleye open.  Even occasionally I'll find an open trib and drift for bows, but ice fishing is getting to be more enjoyable as I learn more about winter patterns."
25552,Roy,2007-01-23 18:06:00,13728,I enjoy ice fishing as well. I just don't get to do as much as I'd like to. I haven't even put the float suit on once this year. I hope maybe I can hit St-Pierre this coming weekend.
25554,jason27fish,2007-01-23 18:09:00,90,real fisherman fish through the ice lol
25409,Rich,2007-01-23 03:47:00,3927,"I think there is a certain social aspect of ice fishing that you cant get from regular fishing. Sure a group of guys can go out in boats and yell to each other, but out on the ice is like a big gathering. Share tips, stories and cold 'pops'. Not that ice fishing alone isnt just as good."
