25709,GbayGiant,2007-01-23 23:26:00,1780,"I fish the same water 90% of the time and have yet to get a WASS/gps and do fine without one, but I would be blind without a fishfinder.  For all you guys that have both or have used both before, what sytem would you choose if it could only be one or the other, a GPS or fishfinder ? I know having both is nice, but what do you depend on more ?"
25714,Terry,2007-01-23 23:32:00,14456,need my fishfinder.......... can't live without it
25722,fishman1023,2007-01-23 23:49:00,6,I guess if I could I would get both.  You never know when you will be fishing another body of water and then you would wish you had it.  I think the GPS portion as come down in price quite a bit the past few years. I would be lost with both.
25724,aniceguy,2007-01-23 23:51:00,1094,I ll take a handheld with a navionics chip any day of the week
25730,Bernie,2007-01-24 00:00:00,3190,Gotta have the depthfinder.   Those walleye are at a certain depth on a shoal the gps isnt accurate enough.
25734,Rich Clemens,2007-01-24 00:07:00,3131,Fishfinder for me.    Suspended fish eh ?   Where have I heard that phrase before ?
25808,fishindevil,2007-01-24 01:39:00,6254,well thats a no-brainer   lowrance 339 IGPS/dumb ass...... all the way
25813,kemper,2007-01-24 01:45:00,2232,"neither. I fish blind, and probably always will. To me it seems like being able to see the fish is just unfair. I like the challenge of trying different patterns untill you locate the fish. Try it one time, turn off the fishfinder on a lake you dont fish alot and try to catch something, if youre used to always having the electronics you might find it more difficult than you expect."
