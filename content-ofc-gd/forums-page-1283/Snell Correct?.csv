I used red hooks and chartreuse line for this sample just so the knot was more visible. One more question, what pound flouro should i use in general to tie up my harnesses and what should i end up with hook to hook. Im starting with 3"" but if theres any suggestions why i might go smaller or larger feel free to explain. Thanks guys.    "
