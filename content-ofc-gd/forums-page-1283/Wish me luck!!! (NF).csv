25119,Headhunter,2007-01-22 15:19:00,5703,"Well, after scouring the east end of Scarborough for the last three weeks, my wife and I have finally settled on which new to us house we are going to offer out on!  We will be making an offer this afternoon and hopefully, the vendor accepts it. It will be a real ""culture shock"" for us, as we have lived in the downtown core for 13 years, but our house has gotten too small, with the recent arrival of two kids. My hopefully new home has a few things I don't have now; -a drive way! -a 2 car garage!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -3000 sq. ft, compared to 800! -a pool! I could go on... but I'm pretty nervous/excited/ worried/ well, you get the drift! Making a decision that will affect your life for the next 20-25 years is HUGE... but I know it's the right move! HH"
25122,motv8tr,2007-01-22 15:22:00,2587,"Good luck HH, I know what you're going through, did it myself a year ago...and I don't regret it one bit and it was worth every little bit of stress  Let us know how it goes...  Maureen"
25124,Joey,2007-01-22 15:24:00,9122,Good Luck HH.  I sure hope you get it for the future OFC Pool Parties  Joey
25129,Headhunter,2007-01-22 15:32:00,5703,"Thanks Moe and Joey! A summer OFC pool party sounds like an awesome idea... and everyone could bring their rods, we could walk the 5 mins down to the lake and try  for some big Lake O carp! HH"
25134,Nemo,2007-01-22 15:37:00,727,Good luck can the garage store your new boat?
25139,Headhunter,2007-01-22 15:44:00,5703,"Nemo... yup! It's a two car garage and will hold my ""new boat"". HH"
25140,Terry,2007-01-22 15:46:00,14456,good luck
25158,ketchenany,2007-01-22 16:28:00,3229,Hope you get HH and then you can stock the ceement pond and cast from the comfort of the patio table while downing a cold one. Best of luck
25164,John,2007-01-22 16:39:00,2956,Good luck HH..
25165,SHAD,2007-01-22 16:41:00,134,"Sounds like a sweet pad, you win some coin $$$, lol, gl dude"
25174,Clampet,2007-01-22 16:59:00,1947,Good fer you an the family. You won't be too far from Lew. Grannies plannin on havin a hoot'n annie in yer honor! 
25180,Headhunter,2007-01-22 17:26:00,5703,Thanks for all the kind thoughts everyone! I'll update this as soon as I know more! Highland creek in my back yard... no excuse not take the kids down to the lake and start teaching them there is more to life than the big city offers! HH
25352,Garyv,2007-01-23 01:17:00,547,"You won't miss the city.  Before we moved to Canada we lived in a ""village"" outside of Chicago with 80000+ people, were 1/2 block away from one of the largest zoos in the world ( Brookfield Zoo ) and were surrounded by shopping malls, super highways, and of course Chicago visible to the east with it's millions of people.  Our first house in Canada was in Acton Ontario until we moved where to where you visited me 2 years ago.  I couldn't nor would I ever want to live in the city again.  Everyone has preferences and mine is just to visit them and live away from them.  You will be happy with your purchase, hope everything goes ok for you."
25445,Big Cliff,2007-01-23 10:54:00,6899,"I remember when Sue and I bought our first house, $40,000.00 mortage and we woried our selves sick over the ""what ifs"". LOL.  Was the smartest thing we could have done! Don't worry, be happy! Good luck!"
25448,motv8tr,2007-01-23 11:11:00,2587,"OK HH, what happened???  Do you own a new house yet???  inquiring minds want to know  lol  Maureen"
25450,Rich Clemens,2007-01-23 11:19:00,3131,"Well HH .... hopefully you'll know soon.    My best too ya ... even if it is a day late.    We have a two car .... I mean a one-car / one-boat garage too.  My poor ole truck gets to sit outside now.  I tried to say it was a one-truck / one-boat garage, but that did not go over at all, if you know what I mean."
25478,Headhunter,2007-01-23 14:30:00,5703,"Thanks again everyone for your kind words of encouragement. We made our almost best offer last night, but we were rejected by one half of the owners. What I mean by this is as follows; We are dealing with a couple who are either separated or are in the process of splitting up. The husband wants to keep the house and buy his wife out, the wife simply wants out. The husband has a number set in his head and simply will not budge. The house has been on the market for the better part of 8 months, with only two offers, including mine, both rejected. We really had our hearts set on this house, but as it stands right now, our agent has suggested that even if we were to offer their price, it might not sell. We will find out today if the house is being pulled off the market as the vendor's agent is fed-up as well! There's a very slight chance that after their long chat last night, they may come to some kind of compromise, but I highly doubt it! It looks like it's back to searching and looking! Again, thanks for all your kind thoughts... and Gary, I'm with you 100% when it comes to getting out of the big city. HH"
25519,TennesseeGuy,2007-01-23 16:31:00,957,"I hope wife's boyfriend doesn't figure out a way to sell the house to the company that is providing fire insurance coverage.  It happens, especially when the dwelling is unoccupied."
25564,motv8tr,2007-01-23 18:17:00,2587,"I went through something similar with my first house, huge pain in the butt....in the end I got the house though. The house I'm in now was actually my second choice, the first one I wanted fell through when the seller changed his mind right after I finally agreed to his price  , personally I think in the end it worked out better for me.  I hope it works out for you, nothing worse than really wanting a place and having it fall through for something like that.  Who knows, maybe you'll find a better place if this one falls through.  Maureen"
25578,Headhunter,2007-01-23 19:13:00,5703,"Well I just heard from my agent and the house has been removed from the market, the husband has bought out the wife! Oh well, there's plenty of houses out there! Thanks again to all! HH"
25593,Chuck Best,2007-01-23 19:52:00,308,"All that means is that it was never meant to be HH,Keep looking there new ones around every corner...."
25617,Headhunter,2007-01-23 20:28:00,5703,"Exactly my thinking Big Chev4x4! Admittedly, we are disappointed, however, I learned a ton from the experience and know that we will find the right house for us, in due time. HH"
25664,TAH,2007-01-23 21:57:00,133,"sorry to hear that HH, keep looking the right house will come to you.and maybe at a cheaper price."
