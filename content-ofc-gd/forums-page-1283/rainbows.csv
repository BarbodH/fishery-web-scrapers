25369,crusty,2007-01-23 02:05:00,83,anyone wanta tell me how to catch Calabogie rainbows......through the ice. depth lure bait time of day  much appreciated
25370,urbanangler1990,2007-01-23 02:10:00,933,"as far as i know u can catch rainbows in stocked lakes or usually river mouths for running steelhead, im sure Canadian Copper can help ya more..."
25382,kemper,2007-01-23 02:30:00,2232,"ask CC, it seems that if there is a chromie to be caught, well its probably on the end of his line!  most steelheaders go home when the river freezes, CC just knocks a hole in the ice and keeps fishin."
25389,GbayGiant,2007-01-23 02:39:00,1780,"I use to go to a river mouth as far out on the ice as I could to get to the open water, beach cast a egg sinker and floating roe bag about 12"" of bottom. Worked good for me."
25405,canadian_copper,2007-01-23 03:25:00,925,"JUST LIKE ICEFISHING ANY OTHER FISH!!! MAKE A HOLE AND DROP A LINE  LOL  I WOULD USE A CHIPPER TO MAKE YOUR HOLES!!! AUGER IS TOO SMALL!!  12""AROUND CHIPPED TODAY!  PRETTY HARD TO PULL A 15LB STEELHEAD THREW A 6""HOLE  LOL  SAME BAITS YA'D USE IN THE SPRING RIVER FISHIN!! MINNOW JIG (SMALL BLACK WHEN THE MAYFLY HATCH IN FEB!!) ROE WORM LITTLE CLEO  SUNUP AND SUNDOWN IS BEST TIMES!!! NO DIFFERENT THEN THE SPRING BESIDES A HARD COLD SURFACE  LOL"
25418,charlied,2007-01-23 04:07:00,584,Hey CC.....is that in a tributary your ice fishing....can the ice really get thick enough to stand on....I am from Niagara and we don't have the tribs around here to test that!
25428,FishFinder,2007-01-23 04:28:00,481,"yes, in the eastern ""ditches"" the creeks are really small and there is almost no flow to the water so it freezes over pretty well."
