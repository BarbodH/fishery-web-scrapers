25103,Crazyhook,2007-01-22 14:36:00,1154,  Perfect why post anything actually...  back to just emailing my fishing friends
25109,Joey,2007-01-22 14:47:00,9122,"I have touched up my photos if they are too dark, but I never change the background and never will.  If other people want to, I don't really care.  Their photos aren't going in my album, mine are.  Joey"

25156,douG,2007-01-22 16:21:00,2693,"We are all different in many ways.  Post whatever you want, however you want to do it.  This world and the bigger one outside (the real one) would be a boring tedious place if we were all the same.  Everyone have a nice day, now."
25189,ccmtcanada,2007-01-22 18:01:00,7971,"Ok...here's my two cents....  I'm fortunate that all my pics have been taken at night, so there is nothing in the background anyways.  However, after a particularly great night...I posted a bunch of pics on here.  I had PMs of people telling me to make sure no one could use my pics to see where we were....and to keep out spot a secret.  I even had one guy look back to all my previous posts and point out where landmarks were that are recognizable...even though the pic was at night.  Shore/trib fisherpeople are at a disadvantage when it comes to fishing spots...especially in urban areas.  It's one thing to take a pic out on a lake, but in my opinion, the risk is greater for us that the spot will be found/destroyed.  Anyhow, photoshop away...I love seeing the pics of the ppl and fish....and reading the reports.  It's what brought me to this board in the first place."

25412,FishFinder,2007-01-23 03:55:00,481,lol now no one says a thing
25413,Rich,2007-01-23 03:59:00,3927,Can someone photoshop me some banana bread? I'm hungry.
25494,kemper,2007-01-23 15:14:00,2232,"Im against photoshop in most cases, (read post in locked thread) but in some cases (I.E snag) it is a very good idea to photoshop the pictures. Something recognisable like the CN tower in the background could definatly add pressure to a spot. Now where I fish, unless you recognise that rock in the river or the pine tree over my shoulder, you would never find the place. And if you did, it would be because YOU HAD ALREADY FISHED THERE.  kemper"
25538,Steve,2007-01-23 17:32:00,2075,"It all boils down to if someone really wants to know where your fishing, they'll find out. I mean it doesn't even take pictures...just being part of an active board does it. You can be careful as you want, like CCMT, however, all it takes is reading his posts outside of fishing reports....chatting about his daughter with crazyhook, the beans were spilled....intentionally? of course not.  as soon as someone makes a post, even without pictures, your opening up a chance of having your fishing spot fished....."
25020,Gerritt,2007-01-22 04:57:00,6129,"   To be honest Snag for me (me myself and I) I like pics that show scenery... I personally think that the reason I fish is because I love being outdoors surrounded by nature. How can I say this and get my point across correctly....???? If there are obvious landmarks say a skyscraper, or a fishing lodge, a bridge, yes if you are concerned about your spot then by all means blurr it out as it is an obvious landmark... but if you are surround by trees and rock (yanno nature stuff) then leave it in. It adds so much more to the report and to the pictures in general.. In away I agree with you yes some reports are a type of self gratification... but as of late some of these reports have gotten worse and worse... look at my trout I caught it in the Grand Canyon! these are hardly reports but are more along the lines of see me and my fish!! I took heat (in pms) for posting my last report because I didnt edit the pics and I told people where I was... for christ's sakes you could see the Blue Mountains in the background... heaven forbid..  I will not edit my pictures as I think pictures of mothers natures beauty are just as deserving of praise...  perhaps we should start editing the backgrounds of Owl pictures too.... just so NOONE else can photograph them... understand what I am trying to convey?   not to mention the fact that SOMEONE owns the pictures that have been used as backgrounds... and could be sued without having permission to use them or paying royalties. This site could also be asked to remove said pictures via legal channels. <--- Just a thought..Please do not post copyrighted material.  <-- as per the board rules...  we know OFC doesnt need anymore legal hassles.  Gerritt."
25100,snag,2007-01-22 14:29:00,1932,"Looks like we are pretty much on the same page.  I have never inserted another image to conceal a location, only blurring.  I don't have the time or skill to bother.  I also prefer the au' natural look; whenever possible.  I will also preserve mother natures beauty by posting hard to locate, un-adulterated photos and posting blurred, don't-come-here-and-ruin-the-fishing-for-me photos.  I have to warn you now that I feel an urge to include your likeness into one of my future posts!!!  Cheers"
