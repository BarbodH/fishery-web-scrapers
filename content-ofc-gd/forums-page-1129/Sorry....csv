126564,TJQ,2007-10-25 00:58:00,7806,"Every year I post pictures of the first fresh wild meat meal of the year.  One reason that I do this I do this to remind myself that one of the reasons I love hunting and fishing is the harvest of bounty that were allowed (I like the beer too...  but someone else makes that...)  So here we go...  Moose meat on the BBQ...  tenderloin with Montreal Steak Spice,  loin steak with Bulls Eye BBQ sauce... and round steak in my soya marinade.  a bit of mashed potatoes, some green peas and some rose and  BAM!!!!        "
