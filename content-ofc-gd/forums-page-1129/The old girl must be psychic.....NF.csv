I opened this mornings paper and there it was.........yup, the joint burned up last night, only about 6 hours after her comment.  Maybe it's time for the Mrs to go out and purchase a few extra lottery tickets"
126983,Joey,2007-10-26 14:39:00,9122,"Wow, that is freaky Lew.  Or she was out there with a pack of matches last night while you slept  Seriously, things like that happen to me and my mom all the time, its kind of eerie.  Definately get her to go buy a lottery ticket, although it never works for me, you just never know.  Joey"
127011,irishfield,2007-10-26 16:26:00,26272,"Like Joey says...and now since you put it in print the police are gonna come bangin on the door to arrest the Mrs for arson! lol  I live with a house full of ""witches"" that see stuff like that in advance...."
127014,Weeds,2007-10-26 16:35:00,782,Hopefully she is psychic; I bought 10 bucks worth of tickets for Wednesdays draw and have no idea where I put them! Maybe you could ask her for me?
127035,GbayGiant,2007-10-26 17:56:00,1780, That's classic Lew.  Get those tickets.
127070,Handlebarz,2007-10-26 19:53:00,3790,Lew please ask Diane if I should get out this weekend (well I know that answer) now what sould I use?
127132,Fisherman,2007-10-26 23:56:00,7201,"Ya, if they'd a spent the money that was in one brown bag for a couple of cheap smoke detectors..."
127137,Terry,2007-10-27 00:18:00,14456,that's wild but don't buy tickets they will just burn down
