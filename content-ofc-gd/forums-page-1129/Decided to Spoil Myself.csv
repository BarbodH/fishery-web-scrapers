127307,Spiel,2007-10-27 17:47:00,9065,"....So out of necessity I'm in the process of putting together a new steelhead float fishing outfit. The reason being simply the inability to use my center pin reel thse day due to a work place injury. Without getting into details the problem is one of right arm pain and almost instant numbness when gripping anything for more than a few minutes. So not willing to give up on floating for steelies I decided to build myself a new float rod designed to be held in my left hand and to be paired with a quality bait caster. The rod is an 11 1/2 foot Frontier rated for 4-8lb test and will be fitted with top of the line Titanium framed S.I.C guides. The reel, well it's a thing of beauty! With the help of some dear friends south of the border I was able to get a bargain price on a Shimano Calcutta TE 200DC. I'm telling you this reel is sweeeeeet. I've no doubt this reel will surpass all my expectations. The spool free spins every bit as well as my center pin which of course is crucial for drifting float rigs. The digital cast control I expect will allow me to toss even the lightest of set ups without fear of birds nesting. Now all I need to do is get off my butt and get my new rod assembled.    To my friends south of the border, a million thanks, you're the best."

127313,silveradosheriff,2007-10-27 18:04:00,1025,Sweet Reel!
127315,Terry,2007-10-27 18:17:00,14456,yup it is a great reel  I love my Shimano Calais TE 200DC.
127316,lew,2007-10-27 18:24:00,12767,"Everything I've heard about those reels says their excellent Chris, and if your making the rod, it's guaranteed to match up perfectely.  It'll be a great set-up  !!"
127331,aplumma,2007-10-27 19:30:00,6896,"Now thats a reel bud, I can't wait to cast it at lak Air but I am afraid once I do I will be alittle poorer from the experiance.   Art"
127350,Dano,2007-10-27 21:12:00,719,"Hey man, sounds like a sweet set-up, good on you."
127363,SlowPoke,2007-10-27 22:34:00,2984,You did spoil yourself! I never thought of using a baitcaster for a float rod until I saw a used combo for sale. The one for sale was on a twist rod. Are you going to make a twist rod for your setup? -Brian
127369,Spiel,2007-10-27 22:40:00,9065,....Yes Brian I will be doing a twist. Actually with the light action of the long rod it's the only way to go. The concept of using bait casters for float fishing is not new however. I had a friend who was doing it over 25 years ago. And friends of mine who've been using center pins like myself for over 25 years have become devout converts to the bait cast system. They swear once I use my new outfit I'll never go back.
127396,solopaddler,2007-10-28 00:28:00,8605,"That's a sweet reel. I've got a buddy who runs one on a converted Sage 131/2' float rod with a spiral wrap, pretty awesome rig. Can't wait to see how the Frontier turns out, that'll be interesting."
