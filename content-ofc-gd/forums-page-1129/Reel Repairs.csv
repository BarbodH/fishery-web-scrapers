I seem to have misplaced their info? I have a 2000 Symetre I use on a rod for perch / crappies that needs an overhaul, and Aikmans is a bit far (40 minutes across 'Suicide Alley') for something as simple as a good cleaning. Apparently Lebarons has the 1000 & 2000 Stradics on for $130.00, but if I can get my 6 year old Symetre back in good working order (handle sticks a bit when rewinding) for about $25.00, right next door, that's the way to go. Any info on these guys would be appreciated. T'anks."

When I came back to get them, he told me reel #1 needed some new parts, but he didn't bother ordering them   When I asked him how he made out with reel #2 he just shrugged his shoulders and said he never looked at it, and handed them both back to me  When I asked why he disn't fix them, he just said   ........again  I got the impression I was intruding on his time, so I took them out to Aikmens who fixed them up like new as he always does.  It's a long drive out to Aikmens for me too, but ya gets what ya pays for"
127511,MJL,2007-10-28 14:52:00,2427,I heard there was a place at Pharmacy and Finch near the gas station but a few people told me it closed down.  Never been there myself.  I usually take my reels to Angling Specialties for servicing.

T'anks for the heads up Lew!"
