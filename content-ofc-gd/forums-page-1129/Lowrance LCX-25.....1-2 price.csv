120840,Terry,2007-10-05 13:26:00,14456,"dang, that is a good deal if only I didn't just buy an expensive reel and the boat and the seats and the rod holders and  the reel with the line counter and and ...  lets see what excuse can I think up to tell the wife"
120846,Hedfish,2007-10-05 13:44:00,76,"""Honey, remember all the fishing stuff that I bought lately? It's all useless if I don't know where the fish is, so I need to buy this tiny little last thing. It's on sale, so it's practically free.""  Try this one. The key is to use words ""useless"", ""fishing"" and ""sale"" in one sentence, this is supposed to put women in a good mood."
120853,Roy,2007-10-05 14:10:00,13728,"That won't work. She'll just say ""You're right honey, it IS a useless fishing sale."""
120875,Terry,2007-10-05 14:52:00,14456,Ok ok  how about ...oh honey I know how busy you are so I did some Xmas shopping so you wouldn't have to.... and I think it's the perfect gift .....and yada yada yada....  hey it could work
