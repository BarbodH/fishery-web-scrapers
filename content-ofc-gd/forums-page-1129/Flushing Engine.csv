Im not exactly sure of where to put it. The only place that i have found is right above the prop on the little wing thing (i dont know the technical name of it) But if i attach it to this place the prop will smack it. So do I have to remove the prop to do this, or is there another place on the outboard that i am not looking to attach the hose to with the ear muffs. Thanks. by the way I have a 15hp 4 stroke merc."

126870,mattyk,2007-10-26 02:12:00,2110,"No, not in saltwater. But i want to winterize and i want to run the engine while its not in the water. I doing this so that i can put fuel stablizer in the engine and run it for about 15 mintues."

As for placement; they muffs need to cover the water intakes in order to function.  Make sure that water is coming out of the tell tale hole on the motor so that you can be sure that you are getting water trough the pump.
