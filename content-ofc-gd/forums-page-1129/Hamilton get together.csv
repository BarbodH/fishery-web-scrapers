126863,Loonietoon,2007-10-26 01:55:00,1450,"Well just returned home after meeting hometownhandyman at Cheers as planed. Albert made the arrangements for us to have a nice spot.. they brought in extra staff and the only ones that showed was myself and Adam... nice showing for a guy new to the board and wanting to meet with others that said ""lets get together for a pint or two""   others responded that yes they were going and he setup a place... now he feels like an   ...............s.. Nice meeting you Adam.. and yes you have a seat in my boat anytime I am going out"
126867,HTHM,2007-10-26 02:08:00,4082,"Yes it was a disapointment that only the two of us showed up. I felt the worst for the resturant though, they were expecting a large number of people and had added an extra staff person to take care of our needs. Well, at least WE were well taken care of!"
126869,Gerritt,2007-10-26 02:11:00,6129,First off... I have to apologize to everyone.. We were given the unfortunate task of helping my wifes Grandmother get down into a nursing home as she is no longer able to care for herself... (due to injury) The Social worker was very nice and understanding however... just sad that such an independent woman has been reduced to this.... However it is only temporary until her injuries heal    She has had both Hips replaced last year... and had a spill this year...Please accept my apologies again.. lets setup something else and soon...  Gerritt.
126872,Joey,2007-10-26 02:13:00,9122,"Geez, that really sucks guys.  I'm too far from Hamilton so I never would have made it, but I'm surprised the people that said they would attend didn't show up.  What a bummer.  How were the wings?  Joey"
126924,solopaddler,2007-10-26 11:26:00,8605,"Hey that's too bad guys. As mentioned before I couldn't make it last night, but if there's another opportunity on either a Friday or Saturday night and I'm around town I'm there for sure!"
126927,Sherriff,2007-10-26 11:41:00,252,"Sorry guys, did not get out of work till too late as mentioned earlier.  Sherriff"
127056,Spiel,2007-10-26 19:19:00,9065,....How unfortunate. I would have been there if I could but alas I was in on the long 12 hour nightshift.
127079,henryko,2007-10-26 20:41:00,41,"Sorry to hear that. If I have a car or can catch a ride to the event next time, I'll never miss an event like this!"
127153,Loonietoon,2007-10-27 00:50:00,1450,I don't know about the Wings Joey.. you would have to ask Albert...   He seamed to be making a good job of cleaning them out
