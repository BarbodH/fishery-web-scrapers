126281,misfish,2007-10-24 13:23:00,29133,"Charles,make the run up to Cooch. 5 fish limit no worries.LOL  See you there."
126291,Mark Kulik,2007-10-24 13:59:00,348,"Thank-you Darcy hope to meet you there!, Hi Charles, glad your'e getting out too, I'm pre-fishing thurs. and Fri. its been a mild fall, so perhaps blind may be the best betLOL like Brian said Couch is loaded , the stupid part is a 20 lb. bag won;t event get noticed!"
126294,misfish,2007-10-24 14:10:00,29133, I was helpping with leading the blind Mark.LOL  Maybe see you out there . Were out aswell thursday.
126298,charlesn,2007-10-24 14:20:00,551,"I'm a non-boater for this one, so I'm just going to sit down, shut up, hold on and fish hard.  But if we're not on 'em by 9 AM or if it is cold, windy or rainy, you'll be able to find me having a nice warm breakfast at the Virginia Beach restaurant til about noon...  lol  Will see you boys there, it's going to be fun.  Charles"
126308,gregger27,2007-10-24 14:43:00,14,Is couch fishable during the simcoe open or is it only Simcoe waters?
126324,misfish,2007-10-24 15:33:00,29133, I was only pulling Charles leg. Not sure if it is.
126334,charlesn,2007-10-24 16:03:00,551,"It's open Gregger.  Not sure you'd want to go there, but the option is there.  Charles"
126355,gregger27,2007-10-24 16:57:00,14, That would be a heck of run to get up to Couch!
126433,Mark Kulik,2007-10-24 21:32:00,348,"Couch just doesn't have the same size of fish on average as Simcoe Gregger , not to mention losing a lot of fish-time on an already short day! I wish all the guys good luck, and I'll be out thurs.& Fri. see you soon guys."
126437,misfish,2007-10-24 21:50:00,29133,"Short day,good friends and hopefully lots of big fish. What can one ask to finish off a year of bass,n ????????????????? 5x7 pounders would be nice.LOL Good luck to all.Looking like the weather will be just fine."
126580,Blake,2007-10-25 01:49:00,418,Hope the record gets broken and goodluck to all anglers.
127018,gregger27,2007-10-26 17:02:00,14,Is the lake starting to turn we were out on Thursday and it was tough finding fish and then getting them to bite?  Anyone else finding it tough out there this week?
127033,misfish,2007-10-26 17:46:00,29133,"Tough wasnt the word yesturday.3 ft rollers from the north hard to hold on spots. If my luck is true,my partner and I should do very well. Prefish was very bad,so tourney day should be good.LOL  Temps were 53-56 all over.  Saturday forcast 30 from the west. Going to be a rough ride day."
127047,gregger27,2007-10-26 18:34:00,14,Anything on Saturday will be better than we did during prefish.  Have a good one see you at the launch.
127072,Terry,2007-10-26 20:00:00,14456,good luck to all  get 'er done
