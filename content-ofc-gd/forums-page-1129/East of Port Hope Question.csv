We have recently located in the Ottawa Valley and I was wondering if there were any Salmon/Steelhead opportunities that may be given say East of Port Hope possibly towards Belleville. Not having much luck talking with baitshops down there or finding internet info.  Just trying to find something to attack with waders and C&R.  Thanks  Bushart"
