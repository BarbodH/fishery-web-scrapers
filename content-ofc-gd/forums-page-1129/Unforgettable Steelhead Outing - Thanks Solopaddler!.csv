127180,ccmtcanada,2007-10-27 01:59:00,7971, Yeah...the scenery was amazing...the fall colours were just at their peek.  It was an amazing setting to fish in!
127181,ccmtcanada,2007-10-27 02:02:00,7971," When I first saw the crowd I was thinking ""Oh crap...I'm gonna piss lots of people off today"" LOL.  As it turned out, I saw no one being rude, only 1 crossed line, and everyone kept a very respectful distance between floats.  The fish were on the smaller side, so controlling them wasn't a huge issue.  A weekend...hmmm...as much as I liked that place and experience, a weekend crowd probably would have sent me screaming like a madman...LOL."
