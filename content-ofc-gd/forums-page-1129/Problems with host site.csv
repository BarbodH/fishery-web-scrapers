126936,Mike the Pike,2007-10-26 12:15:00,3421,Myfishingpictures.com has just changed there format and now nothing works can't log in or re register.  I may have to change to another site does anyone have an alternative besides photo Bucket  Help.Mike
126937,jediangler,2007-10-26 12:20:00,1923,"I've had the same problem, all my pics are still there, I just can't link to them."
126938,Roy,2007-10-26 12:20:00,13728,Why do you bother with a host site? Leave the pics on your pooter and post them from there.
126939,Mike the Pike,2007-10-26 12:22:00,3421, How do I do that Roy?
126940,Roy,2007-10-26 12:25:00,13728,"When you post to a thread, lower down that page there's a place that says attachments. Click on 'browse' then upload the pic you want. It/they will not show in the preview mode but will once posted to the board."
126982,tbayboy,2007-10-26 14:36:00,1497,"I'm a fan of flickr, similair to photobucket but with more flexibility (at least in my mind).  The problem with posting as attachments from what I've heard is that you've got to resize and get them to fit within the attachment limits (but I can't say for sure since I haven't tried)."
127019,BITEME,2007-10-26 17:10:00,1969,This is where we think the dump will be just talked to a guy i work with who has a cottage up there and this was the first he had heard about it 
127159,mistyjr1,2007-10-27 01:03:00,97,Maybe try Filehive.com
127164,danc,2007-10-27 01:18:00,4677,"  I'm not a big fan of myfishingpictures.com. Believe it or not, I was the first person ever to upload a photo there. Ding ding ding!!!! We have a winner. I was promised a free tee shirt for being the first. I never got it. The site has been hacked repeatedly lately as well. Someone had a good idea but never looked after the site. I look at some of the newest photos occasionally, but have no use for it otherwise."
127165,bigfish1965,2007-10-27 01:32:00,3382,You can also use the photo gallery here. Everyone has their own gallery. Use it..we pay for it!
