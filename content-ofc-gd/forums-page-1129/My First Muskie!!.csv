127089,wuchikubo,2007-10-26 21:03:00,1114,"Congrats on your first 'ski, I'm looking for my first legal muskie myself, my first one was like Zib's."
127111,John Glynn,2007-10-26 22:30:00,25,"Congrads My first muskie was 20 inches. I have not caught one since after about 80 hours on the water, but I will keep on trying."
126034,Jacques,2007-10-23 17:11:00,97,"Last weekend I had my third kick at the can trying to land my first muskie.  I headed up to my buddy Don's cottage in the Kawarthas.  The weather was unsettled with a good wind -- just right for a muskie drift.  We spent mornings and evening fishing for walleye -- managing about six between the four of us plus a lot of bass -- it seems smallmouth are establishing a bigger presence in the lake we were in.  We drifted for Muskie using lures made by Don and his Dad -- Spinner/weight combos hooked with a large minnow.  I have to say, I was totally prepared to *not* catch a muskie.  So when my rod rapped twice and then doubled over, the old heart started thumping big time.  I set hooks but was pretty nervous about losing the fish -- my worry compunded by the fact I was using a baitcaster that wasn't mine and was familiar enough with the drag while you're sititing around, but not so much in the heat of the moment.  She fought pretty hard and had a good run near the boat.  Man, I was shaking and reliving that fish for the next hour.  I got bit by the muskie bug hard on this trip.  As you can see from the pic, I don't have a flattering hold on the fish but she was just over 40""...    Tim's muskie birdnested his reel but he managed to detangle and hold onto the fish...    Now here's Don's secret tip to catching muskie... Pretend you're fishing for walleye and rig up some eight pound line with a 3/8 oz white jig and a small minnow.  Don't bother using a leader -- you won't need one to land the fish.    It was a great weekend and thanks to all you Muskie guys out there for posting your pics and giving us newbies something to aspire to!  Jacques"
126035,Rich,2007-10-23 17:13:00,3927,Nice work and congrats on your first!
126037,irishfield,2007-10-23 17:15:00,26272,Some nice fish there. Gotta tell Tim he's gotta stop crossing his arms....
126040,dsn,2007-10-23 17:19:00,1018, That's what you call a pro. One who can untangle a birds nest and still fight the fish at the same time and manage to land it.  I'm not one of them. 
126041,bpsbassman,2007-10-23 17:20:00,941,Congratulations.  Great looking fish. You've got all winter to enjoy that one!

126987,djackson,2007-10-26 14:52:00,1,"Nice Fish Jacques!! But you forgot to mention about the TOTAL, UNBRIDLED PANIC that set in intially, before receiving some friendly advice and relaxing and enjoying it (lol). As for ""Tim's"" picture, he got the bird's nest out of his reel, but had difficulty getting it out of his arms. It took him a couple of days to straighten that one out!  I know this, because I'm the dude beside Jacques in his picture.   It was truly a GREAT weekend!!!"
127042,GbayGiant,2007-10-26 18:15:00,1780,"Very nice, those are some beauts, congrats on the first, I'm sure it won't be the last, you'll just be more addicted now.  Zib, that's crazy never sen a fry musky, but look at the colors, perfect."
127043,bigbuck,2007-10-26 18:25:00,2449,Nice 'ski for a first!!! Remember the  boy scout motto when fishing 'be prepared'. Fishing for walleye and nailing a nice 'ski.........PRICELESS!!
