127010,lew,2007-10-26 16:19:00,12767,"I'm thinking of purchasing this sonar for my boat and wondered if anyone uses it and has any thoughts on this model, good bad or ugly.  It'll be used in conjunction with my Lowrance Globalmap 7200C  "
127012,Squid,2007-10-26 16:34:00,1656,Looks nice?
127017,Roy,2007-10-26 16:54:00,13728,"Good unit Lew. I don't know where you want to install it. Putting it next to your Global map is one option but I'd  try to install that one at the bow and connect it to your Global map. That way, you should be able to share information between units at the touch of a button. Look into it Bud. I'm pretty sure it's doable  with the 510. Both those units are NMEA certified so it shouldn't be a problem."
127095,lew,2007-10-26 21:31:00,12767,"Thanks Roy, but this new unit will be replacing the one on the console. I already have another unit on the bow now."
127237,tschirk,2007-10-27 07:21:00,261,Hey Lew I have the previous years model LMS334iGPS And I am quite happy with it. The maps aren't cheap but work great. Cheers Ted
127480,Smokey,2007-10-28 12:30:00,1278,I don't think you can go wrong with any of the Lowrance products. A friend of mine is using the 510 and I fished with him on Erie and it worked well on the big water. For sure the colour unit is the way to go. Both my units on the boat have been updated to colour and what a difference quick glances at them make to identify features and fish. It's something I should have done years ago to get rid of the old unit supplied with the boat.
127488,lew,2007-10-28 12:58:00,12767,"Thanks Mike, that's what I wanted to hear, and if it's 1/2 as good as the Globalmap I'll be more than happy. Lookin forward to getting rid of the b/w unit and catching up with the 21st century"
