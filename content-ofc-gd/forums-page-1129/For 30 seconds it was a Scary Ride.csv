126498,Garry2Rs,2007-10-24 23:02:00,1425,"Hi guys; Buck and I left our Summer home in the Kawartha's and headed south for the Winter after breakfast on the 12th of October.  We arrived in Yuma Arizona on the evening of the 14th. Along the way we wrecked our boat and trailer when a leaf spring on the right side of the trailer snapped in half and sent us into a very interesting skid and spin-out.  Fortunately we missed the other traffic and the guard rails and got stopped with no damage to ourselves. The boat took heavy damage to the right rear quarter when the wheel on that side tried to climb into the boat...the axle is bent, the tires are scrubbed bald, the skeg is broken, the SS prop is mangled, but everything is insured and we were able to drive away...after the wrecker took charge of the boat and trailer. We await the insurance company's decision regarding fixing or writing off our stuff. In the meantime we are shore fishing at a local pond.  This time of year there are Catfish and some type of Sunfish available.  The Cat's are hatchery raised Channel Cat's.  They appear steel gray rather than gold like the wild ones.  The sunfish have a long blue ""ear"" and are fairly light in colour with subtle vertical bands, sort of like some Muskies.  I have pictures but I left the camera to PC connection cord at home...Dawh...You will have to wait until I get a new cord or a card reader, which ever costs less...GRIN. Garry2rs"

126562,pikehunter,2007-10-25 00:51:00,1659,"Wow! Scary ride! Glad  to hear that you are all well after the incident.  Yuma is a dry dusty town, at least for the couple of days we stayed there back in the winter of 1989/90. I believe it's one of the warmest places in Arizona during the winter. We were there right around the time that there was a big gem show happening.  Have a good time down south and post some pictures of your adventures."
126587,Joey,2007-10-25 02:00:00,9122,"Wow, glad you're okay Garry.  That must have been scary.  Looks like a good call leaving this weather up here for that weather  Joey"

126687,Seaweed,2007-10-25 13:13:00,135,Wow scary stuff.  Look on the bright side though.... if the insurance says buy another boat... you are in the area for some good deals...  Glad no one was hurt.  Sorry for the boat.
126694,Bly,2007-10-25 13:49:00,1556,Glad to hear that you and Buck are OK.   Best of luck with the boat repair/replacement.  Look forward to seeing some of your pictures.
126792,MuskyBill,2007-10-25 22:05:00,311,"Well, your trips south are always interesting Garry, aren't they?  The blown trailer tire in Dallas in the middle of the night was bad enough, but GEEZ, you didn't have to go through all this trouble, didja??  Glad to hear you're both alright..."
126793,fishnsled,2007-10-25 22:17:00,3520,Glad everyone is OK.  It would have be quite sad if this had turned out for the worst.  Looking forward to some reports of the fishing variety!

126918,steve_paul,2007-10-26 11:06:00,658,"Garry, sorry to hear about the accident but thankfully you and Buck made it there.  Enjoy the warmth and hopefully all turns out well with the boat and insurance."
126981,cisco,2007-10-26 14:28:00,597,Glad you're both OK! Have a great time down there and I hope the insurance settlement is quick and fair!
127046,bigbuck,2007-10-26 18:31:00,2449,"Good to hear you weren't hurt! Who cares about the boat, it can be either fixed or replaced. Yuma huh, I've got a buddy who moved down there and is a teacher and a soccer coach. He hates visits in the winter now, the poor guy is wearing a coat, sweater, longjohns etc.... INSIDE THE HOUSE!!! when he comes up to see family/friends."
127048,Spiel,2007-10-26 18:37:00,9065,".....Scary stuff Garry, I'm glad the two of you came out unscathed. The collateral damage can be replaced unlike yourselves."
