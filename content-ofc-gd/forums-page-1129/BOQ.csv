127351,brad&rim,2007-10-27 21:16:00,3,Nice to hear everyone is catching fish.  I am new to the board I am heading out to BOQ tomorrow for the first time. Never fished there on open water before. We were hopeing to fish the mouth of Hay Bay but are not sure where launching is possible.  We are coming from the west(Port Hope area). Any help would be greatly apreciated.
127384,superdad,2007-10-27 23:47:00,353,"Easiest to get to would be the launch at the East side of the Glenora Ferry, exit for Napanee south, turn left past Timmes and keep going to the Lake and turn right to the ferry.  That way you won't have to drive thru Picton, or Prince Edward county.  Lotsa Luck"

127423,Mike the Pike,2007-10-28 01:40:00,3421,I was on the BOQ today I hope you have a big ass boat cause it was nasty at times close to 5 footers.  We managed only one eye just past the ferry a nice little 8 pounder my buddy got into a 11lb sheeps head and another boat who was with us caught a 15lb sheepy.Report to come.  MTP
