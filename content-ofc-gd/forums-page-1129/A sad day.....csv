I went to close-up the cottage yesterday and do the fall clean-up etc. After raking about a half an acre of leaves and winterizing the cottage I'm beat and bummed out. The weather was bad and the lake level was too low to make it worth while trying to launch the boat for a final try at some fall musky fishing. Oh well only 7 months to walleye opening!!!

Terry didn't even turn green...but he sure ate his share of water that came over the windshield!  I always hate the feeling of closing up the cottage...but look at it as another chapter in the book. Close it up...drive away and fish some other lakes 'till they ice up."
