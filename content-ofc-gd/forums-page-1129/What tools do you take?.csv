127244,OhioFisherman,2007-10-27 12:19:00,6623,"If your planning a trip through northern Ohio e-mail me and I will give you my number. I know a little about repairs, and don`t work so usually I am available. Can`t do much except guide you through what you might need to do.  I have tools and stuff around to help. AAA is a good idea. Canadian auto club? My plan will tow my car like 100 miles. If your vehicle can`t be fixed quickly I a room to leave it."
127256,Zamboni,2007-10-27 13:10:00,235," Princess Auto or Canadien Tire often have ratchet strap kits on sale, great to secure your boat to the trailer. Its frightening how many boats are bouncing around while being towed, not good for boat either. Ratchet straps on transom tie downs and bow eyelet are all you need, easy to hook-unhook at ramp also.   edit-Princess Auto latest flyer has 4 peice ratchet strap set on sale starting Tuesday for 12.99"
127257,Pigeontroller,2007-10-27 13:11:00,2793,"This might not apply to your tinny Cliff, but I recently bought extra fuses for everything in my boat. A good idea for the boat registration is to photocopy and laminate it so the copy stays dry in the boat."
127268,irishfield,2007-10-27 14:58:00,26272,It's illegal to laminate any government documents any more PT and has been for over 24 years.. as all our kids have paper birth certificates that are a PITA compared to my laminated one I've had for 45. Best you can do is a zip lock bag.
127269,lew,2007-10-27 15:08:00,12767," Exactly what I do Wayne, photcopy the papers, put em in a ziplock and tape it to an inside compartment of the boat. I was stpped by the OPP twice this summer and both times the coppers said that was the best way to do it.  Always accessible and always dry."
127276,POLLIWOGG,2007-10-27 15:31:00,835,I think someone said photocopies aren't any good now due to some anti terrorist policy.  Best tool might be to sighn up for a Power Squadron boating coarse.  Bare breasted woman calms an angry wind and makes help arrive faster.
127279,irishfield,2007-10-27 15:38:00,26272,The newer vessel licenses coming out of Services Canada are printed on a lazer printer with absolutely no signatures. Can't tell the difference between a photo copy and original. The older ones had signatures..but I've shown damp/runny copies of them to the OPP as well in both my Glastron and steel work boat without incident. I only carry photocopies of vehicle ownership in our trucks/cars and it's legal. There was someone here on OFC that claimed he was charged showing a copy and had to go to court to show the original to have the fine waved. I think he just found an officer that was PMS'ng or he'd ticked him off....or if I remember correctly he had the copy laminated...and that's a NO NO
127280,lew,2007-10-27 15:38:00,12767," According to the OPP this summer, photocopies are perfectly legal and totally acceptible."
127290,SlowPoke,2007-10-27 16:08:00,2984," I will add this as it pertains to cars... if you carry copies of your registration, make sure you have both sides of the document. Your permit sticker is on the back of your registration. The only document you can not use a photocopy for is your insurance pink slip. You must have the original on hand. -Brian"
127327,Pigeontroller,2007-10-27 19:27:00,2793,"Wayne, I did mention photocopying, do not laminate the original."
127332,camillj,2007-10-27 19:39:00,1988,Wow I never heard about the laminating thing before .. is there a particular reason this was made illegal ?
127338,irishfield,2007-10-27 20:10:00,26272,"Because it's easy to hide defects in forged documents by laminating over top of them..based on technology we had a decade or so ago to do so. Now that you can scan, photoshop, etc you can make what ever you want for a document (like temporary paper boaters cards), so laminating may not be such a big deal,,,but someone here on OFC was charged for his copied/laminated vessel licence last year and had to go to court with the original to have the charge withdrawn. I have photocopies in nothing but a zip lock bag in our steel work boat. It's just thrown in the bottom of the rubbermaid container that we store our lifejackets, rain coats and safety supplies in. The inks a bit runny after a few years of getting moist from condensation etc...but OPP didn't have an issue with it as late as first week of September this year. I always have a spare photocopy in the cottage and home in file for when/if it can't be read anymore."
127343,lew,2007-10-27 20:25:00,12767,"My wife recentely applied for a new Birth Certificate and it came by Purolator last week, and it's just a paper document.  I'm like you Wayne, I've had my small, laminated, wallet sized card forever.  Life used to be so much simpler....."
127374,POLLIWOGG,2007-10-27 22:45:00,835,"My bad , it must have been the laminating I was thinking off."
127380,didoban,2007-10-27 23:34:00,65,"tire repair kit and small 12 v air pump.  Also, outboard motor lock if you leave the motor in the boat.  Cheers!"
127118,Muskieman,2007-10-26 22:55:00,2472,"for the boat.  tools... small tool kit .. pliars, little wrenches and screwdrivers..hammer...prop nut wrench. spare pull cord plugs & plug wrench spare drain plug. duct tape. wire  and spare fuses, navigation light bulbs.

127123,Deano,2007-10-26 23:19:00,767,"I always seem to not have the one tool that I need at the time. LOL  spare paddle, I know it's the law, but always make sure you have your spare paddle. Sometimes you (or your kids) take it out to use in a canoe or another boat, and you only realize it once it's needed.  Also a good idea to get the boat to shore to start working on the motor, you drop a tool, part or bolt in deep water and your not gonna be able to retrieve it."
127129,Garyv,2007-10-26 23:47:00,547,"Enough tools above to sink the Queen Mary....and don't forget make sure your safety chain ""S"" hooks have a snap lock to hold them on.  open ended S hooks ar no longer legal for towing."
127130,camillj,2007-10-26 23:49:00,1988,"OK .. not sure if its just me showing my age ... but the FIRST thing I add to any boat is a shear pin which I tape to the tiller with black electrical tape ... first time you touch bottom its gone and you're stranded .... I ALWAYS also carry a long nail and nippers in my tackle box(which could in a pinch be cut to size to be used as another shear pin for someone elses boat) ... I guess the newer motors dont use them anymore  Aside from the 'usual' safety items  - like 100' rope, flashlight, whistle, 2-way radio I also make a spark plug wrench and a small piece of emery cloth a ALWAYS items ... then at least I can pull a plug and 'clean' it in a pinch ...WD40 also adds a certain je-ne-sais-quois for starting cranky/damp motors"

A length of hose that fits over the spout of a Jerry can(need to fit snug,so wont fall off) that will reach your tank. One end on can, one end in tank= no spillage. Also assortment of fasteners and screws(stainless steel). And some of the other stuff mention  It seem like a lot, but will fit in a large zip lock bag.  I carry alot in the truck."
127179,lookinforwalleye,2007-10-27 01:58:00,4399,the only tool that I have ever carried in my boat is a spark plug wrench and a couple of spare plugs I see no need to keep all the other stuff because I wouldn`t no what to do with it any ways  Just carry a cell and call a tow truck if you need help.
