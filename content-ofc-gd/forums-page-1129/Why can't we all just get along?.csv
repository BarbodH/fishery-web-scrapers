So the question is...can I eat the one that got it's neck broke by the other one...or do I leave it where I did for fox food?  Some people pay good money to watch this kind of action! They went at it for a least 20 minutes before I even bothered walking into the house, grabbing the camera and then heading across the field to photograph."
127058,Fishmaster,2007-10-26 19:33:00,920,I no i would eat it .....call the MNR and say what you seen im sure they would glady invite themself  over for dinner ..cool shots ..
127062,Fishnfiend,2007-10-26 19:43:00,357,"Great shots! If one of them does have a broken neck, call the mnr and u might be allowed to have (eat) it."
127063,Spiel,2007-10-26 19:43:00,9065,....I'd have had it plucked and cleaned before even posting the pics Wayne.  Cools shots by the way.
127067,Roy,2007-10-26 19:51:00,13728,Top two pics look like a baseball argument with the umpire.
127069,pigeonfisher,2007-10-26 19:53:00,696,You should call the local oil supplier and load up the fryer...
127080,irishfield,2007-10-26 20:43:00,26272,"Unfortunate that my camera batteries died after the last shot here. The next one would have looked like WWF as the turkey went from being bent back out of view to a full cartwell and body slam. Neck looked like a limp noodle going around.  I wasn't disappointed...just watched the red fox, that follows these guys around day in ... day out... walk off with supper.  Sorry if the pic are coming and going folks...our server is up and down right now. Got some power issues going on in the Penetang industrial park it appears."
127083,wuchikubo,2007-10-26 20:52:00,1114,Sounds like the turkey gifted you a turkey.  Should have grabbed dinner before the fox.
