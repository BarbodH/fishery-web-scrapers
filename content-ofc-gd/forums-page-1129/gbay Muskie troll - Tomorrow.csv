126693,irishfield,2007-10-25 13:47:00,26272,It's unfortunate that nobody could take Dave up on this offer....I even gave him a certain address to try this morning before he launched !  You OFC'rs need to get your priorities straight.... work is over rated !
126707,Guest gbfisher,2007-10-25 14:32:00,0,Are ya sure she'd be receptive for 2 different fisherman only 2 days apart?  Friday is the day......lol....ya ya...Thats what I'm telling myself anyway..

126733,largemouth,2007-10-25 16:45:00,112," after reading this, 2r's post and few others i have to ask....  why do you always have to make it about you?"
126736,Roy,2007-10-25 16:50:00,13728,Easy there LARGEmouth. Abide by the rules please.
126738,steve_paul,2007-10-25 16:56:00,658," You're so right Wayne, just wish my boss was an OFC'r too and understood  And largemouth, what is the problem    - Wayne is good enough to give a fellow OFC'r somewhere to try that holds a trophy size fish and you have a problem with that?? Also, from what I have seen, Wayne is usually the first one in line when it comes to helping out.  Just my .02 worth."
126741,Guest gbfisher,2007-10-25 17:07:00,0,Some one feeling left out?
126748,largemouth,2007-10-25 17:20:00,112," I wasn't aware I didn't abide, I thought I just asked a simple question about something I noticed. Thanks for your concern though, it is greatly appreciated."
126759,tinbanger,2007-10-25 18:14:00,1028,"sure was a nice morning out there , no fish unfortunatly but...who cares.Took a ride out of the bay before I left it was so calm and sunny .saw only one other boat all morning  Wayne , wore a hole in the water at  that CERTAIN SPOT of yours but no luck maybe next week.  TB"
