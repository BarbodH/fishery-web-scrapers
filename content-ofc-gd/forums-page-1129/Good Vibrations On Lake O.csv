The icing on the cake was making the board in the salmon derby this Aug(29.12 lb). I'm looking forward to next year but It will be hard to beat but I'll be out there trying.  I've posted this Multi-specie video before as well but here is a link in case you haven't seen and I hope to put more out in the future(icefishing musky and BOQ are in the cards),thanks for watching."
