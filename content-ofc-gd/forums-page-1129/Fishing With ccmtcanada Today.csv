126890,sharper,2007-10-26 03:12:00,279,Those are some amazing pictures you took there.
126894,Jigger,2007-10-26 03:31:00,1237,"Great shots! Reminds me of some of the runs in BC. Looks like you could walk bank to bank across their backs! A thing of beauty, thanks for sharing."
126920,solopaddler,2007-10-26 11:12:00,8605," Wow, you are insane! But your enthusiasm is infectious"
126922,solopaddler,2007-10-26 11:14:00,8605," That is correct sir. Even if it was legal to fish this spot, there would be no point even trying. Quite a sight though  ."
126959,fishnsled,2007-10-26 13:28:00,3520,Awesome pics!!
127001,blaque,2007-10-26 15:51:00,2419," Exactly.........  That would be more fun to me to just sit and watch their behavior, than to even think about wetting a line.  GLAD to hear that is a protected occurance, thats just awesome"
127025,jdmls,2007-10-26 17:22:00,575,"  You don't, LOL......there almost always sanctuaries !!!"
127038,GbayGiant,2007-10-26 18:01:00,1780,"That's amazing, never seen that many in one spot before. It's cool how you can see the color differences on each fish when there side by side like that."
126797,solopaddler,2007-10-25 22:39:00,8605,"I think I'm gonna let Cliff tell the story, but another friend of mine Andrew and myself hooked up with Cliff today and we found a huge run of chromers!  (these pic's are all from today)        (I should probably mention we didn't fish this spot, LOL!)"
