Green Bay - Wisconsin  Late yesterday afternoon, Popular guide and Walleye tournament angler Rick Meverdan, passed away unexpectedly while releasing his largest Musky to date, a 50‚Äùer. Luckily, Jeremy Vanert and Shane Mason were nearby, and were able to get to Rick quickly. Shane wanted to thank Jeremy for his CPR efforts, and Dannyboy(Ricks partner for the day) for driving the boat to meet the ambulance.  Rick was a helpful friend to anyone that knew him, and will be sorely missed by all of us. I just regret not accepting the short notice invite to fish the best of the best tourney with him last weekend, though am sure his partner(Jan Regal) is equally happy that he got to spend those hours with him.  Foremost, condolences go out to Ricks family at this time. You are in all of our prayers.   Hey on a positive note.... if you are going to give me a time and a place to die.... this would be in my top five."
