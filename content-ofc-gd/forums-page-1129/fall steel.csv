But we managed to have a decent night.  after a night of nothing, and not seeing anything caught we thought we would wait for a cooler night. we headed down at about 430. each of us getting 2 fish by 7 and missing a couple. mine were small 5.5 and about 3.  my buddies 7.5 and 4. unfortunatly we had to keep 2. only 3 pics wanted to get the other fish back in asap.  saw a few more fish getting caught mostly on metal but I didnt have the casting rod maybe another day.
