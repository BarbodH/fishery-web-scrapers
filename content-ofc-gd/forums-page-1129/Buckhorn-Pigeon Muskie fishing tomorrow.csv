126977,Whitemikeca,2007-10-26 14:15:00,138,I also posted this on the hookups board but I am not sure if anyone reads it so I am posting it here as well.   I am planning on heading up to Buckhorn early tomorrow morning for some muskie fishing and my usual partners have bailed on me.  I have a small boat docked on Upper Buck.  If anyone in the GTA area is interested in some serious muskie fishing and want to join me then please leave me a PM with your number before say 8pm this evening.  Please only respond if you are serious about muskie fishing and have all your own quality muskie gear and tackle.  I will drive up and ask that you pitch in for gas.
