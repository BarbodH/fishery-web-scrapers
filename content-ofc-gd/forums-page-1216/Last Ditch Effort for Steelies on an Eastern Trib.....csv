I went to a favourite hole of mine...crept up and peered into the pool....they are very spooky right now.  What did I spot?  Three steelies....one small and 2 BIG ones, just sitting there.  I walked a little upstream...took out my trusty roe, and began a drift.  They haven't been hitting anything I've drifted by them lately...flys, small jigs....even live wax worms.  As my float entered where I last saw them, my pulse quickened.......suddenly....my float goes down!!! I set the hook expecting a nice fight.  Unfortunately, I brought this little rock bass in.  Oh well...it was not to be...Difting for another 45 minutes yielded nothing.  The trout would actually move out of the way when my bait drifted near them.    It measured at 11.25""...quick pic and back in the creek.  I wasn't thinking and forgot to take a pic with the ofncommunity.com sign...oh well, I'm sure someone else will catch a bigger panfish for the OFC Tourney.  The cool thing is that it qualifies for the OFAH awards.  With this little guy, I have 4 of my 5 species needed for avid angler status for 2007!  I have a 32"" Pike,  28"" Steelhead, 34.5"" Carp and now this 11.25"" Pan Fish. I'm hoping to get at least one Walleye and maybe a Salmon that qualifies later in the year.  Anyhow, I think that will close my season on the tribs...what a season...learned lots...and caught a few fish in the process."

71903,ccmtcanada,2007-05-15 17:20:00,7971," Actually...I didn't use the new rod...that fishing trip was the day before I got it.  The board has been so slow, I didn't bother posting it until now.  I'm sure I'll like the convergence though.  After playing around with it...feeling the action...I already like it more than the one I broke!  Thanks for the tip btw...helped me make my purchase decision.  I'll post again when I receive my 5th species for OFAH...getting avid angler status was a goal of mine this year....although I have to be honest...I didn't think I'd have 4 this early in the year."
