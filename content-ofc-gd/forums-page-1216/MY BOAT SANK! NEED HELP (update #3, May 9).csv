70441,JerseyDog,2007-05-11 12:37:00,190,"OK - well if its a 2004 - same story for the dealer.  Boats should float at bare minimum. If you bought a car and the undercarriage fell off the day you drove it off the lot and destroyed the car and half your gear, would you want a new car?"
71285,walleyemen,2007-05-14 02:51:00,316,"i agree with eye tracker on it being a 04 , but regardless if it was purchased as a new boat all warranty's apply, and tracker does state a lifetime on the hull. not knocking tracker as i own one myself and dealt with problems as well, they will come though for you as it is a long process, they did for me, repainted my boat decaled it twice, because it was not done right the first time, any how if it was bass pro , John Miller will come thru for you,and rudness will get you no where's with this guy, just get it all in writing, another go to guy for tracker canada is David Dusome, he is the head guy for tracker canada, getting a new boat is far a few between unless there was a serious manufactures defect,( a SAfety issue)The key is to be patient, as far as electronics speak to lawrence from lowrance canada in missasuga, this is a great company. Hope all goes well for you."
69329,marvin,2007-05-09 01:01:00,37,"Thats right the boat is aluminum. Its the same as mine, they only look like glass. There was a freighter around  trhat morning but it would not sink the boat. It would have to be one huge wave to do just that and why were there no other boats damaged. I'm telling you I've bought three trackers before and the compant they use for their pumps are famous for leaving it unlocked and thus the water will trickle in from the pump being knocked loose. It almost is for sure mechanical. I would inspect all the welds at the stern,  as there are no more visable for cracks. You have to check your hoses and pumps every time before you go on the water. What does it take 5 minutes, big deal. I've seen it happen to some of the best boats on the market. I use a little bit of thread seizer on all the clamps to ensure they dont get knocked lose during some rough rides.  Hey young one. I went over my boat tonight with a fine tooth comb. Your boat will dryout easily. Seems to me that our boats have a very heavy guage wire so it will handle the water easily. You fuse block will be ok for sure as its designed to get wet, no problem there. Go out and buy plugs for your livewells and baitwells that you can put in when not in use just like I have. You should dry your boat out completely and buy a can of marine grade adhesive for some spots that will or might have lifted a little. Power wash the inside first though as to get out any sand and debris. I power wash my boat twice a month and trust me it gets fully wet inside like yours. I would have your motor serviced at a proper mercury dealer. Dry out everything well and spray a anti mold spray deoderizer. You will be fine. Drain all the fuel and change any fluids and clean and check all wire connections. Hope it works out."
69334,irishfield,2007-05-09 01:06:00,26272,Thanks guys for slappin me back to reality. I was always taught to never grind a weld.
69340,FinS,2007-05-09 01:15:00,463,so did you manage things up?
69371,marvin,2007-05-09 01:58:00,37,lol
69377,young_one,2007-05-09 02:05:00,620,"After a really long day for my parents, and I joined them after school. We have new updates! The dealer is still in the process of boat inspection, they found some problems. The only thing that both parties can confirm 100% is that, the boat was NOT swamped. I'll continue to update any news that I receive. Thank you all for your concerns and expertise. Through this topic, I can truely feel the sense of community in this forum. Thank you OFC Community"
69383,Dutch,2007-05-09 02:14:00,831,Thanks for the update - I want to see how this one turns out!
69385,didoban,2007-05-09 02:18:00,65,"assumming all the assumptions are right, then it got vandalized.....some people are jealous and will do crazy things.  Boat near yours with hose attached to their livewell pump (some use to clean their boat)  and pumped to your new boat.  I know this is distorted but it had happened to us while we were docked and returned unexpectedly. We caught the idiot in the act.  He was almost drowned and charged with mischief...Funny thing was, the wifey dropped kicked him to the water and asked question later.  We  returned the favour and gladly took the hose to his 30' cruiser while he stayed on another boat.  Cop showed up about 2 hours later.  He had more water in his boat than ours.  You/Your boat will survive this misadventure."
69412,mrpike,2007-05-09 04:25:00,151,ANYONE out there NO if there is such a thing as a water alarm you could install . THAT would sound of if the water got higher then lets say 6 to 8 inches from the bottom of your boat.  JUST A THOUGHT.    MAYBE wired into the horn on the boat .
69438,Fisherman,2007-05-09 09:00:00,7201,"Sure, use the same type of float switch that's used to start the bilge pump.  When the float rises, it closes the switch to turn on the pump or horn in your case."
68959,Rich Bowman,2007-05-08 01:20:00,2,"Sorry to hear  about your boat.  I had a similiar problem with my  boat at our camp on  Black lake  New York....It  was always  tied to the dock  with the motor  facing  out to the open  water  because of the depth near our dock....All summer there were no problems,  the  boat was always  covered  with a custom made cover....  A freak  early September  wind storm  blew the waves in the perfect direction to break the waves just between the back of the boat cover  and the motor, and  there was  just a small opening  around the motor.  It  was enough to sink the boat  and  the bottom of the boat  was pounding on the lake bottom  for hours....  Ended up with a damaged  hull,   that was fixed  by an  auto  body  shop that  specialized  in working with  aluminum.  It was fixed  so that it  didn't leak  but  I figured I'd sell it while I could..  Got  a new  boat, had the cover made to fit right up to the motor, no openings  and had the bilge changed  to a float switch.   The  boat  was a 17 foot bass tracker with a 50 on it.   The insurance  did pay for the repair.....  Sounds  like  you might have been swamped if there was any wave  action  at all.......  Good luck keep us informed....  Richie in Pulaski NY...."
68540,bigfish1965,2007-05-07 02:40:00,3382,This is a brand new boat? No question I would want a replacement. They will likely want you to go to your insurance company for items lost that were not part of the boat and your insurance company would then likely go after the manufacturer for reimbursement. If there was big waves they can fill up a boat quick that has the rear end pointed into the wind...but I wouldn't think that much water... Isn't there an auto-bilge on it?
68542,irishfield,2007-05-07 02:42:00,26272,Livewell pump/intake thru hull fitting let go or as others have suggested..it got swamped from wave action. Once one wave gets in..each one after it is only easier and a bilge isn't going to keep up with it...especially since you turned all the switches off by the sounds of it.  They are not going to replace your boat if it got swamped.
68543,glirw,2007-05-07 02:44:00,200,"Holy cow dude . That looks disastrous . I don't have much experience with boats , but I wish you the best of luck . Don't go there until you are 100% sure you know what the problem was . If you seem unsure , they might try to Bull you , depending on their customer service. GOOD LUCK ! It could've been worse."
68544,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-05-07 02:44:00,0,"That really sucks!!!!!I would not be at all pleased for sure!!!!You need to get that boat inspected by someone other than them, to make sure what the problem was!!! Just in case they decide to shaft you!!!You dont want them saying its your fault!"
68545,young_one,2007-05-07 02:47:00,620,"Rick, my boat doesn't have the option of auto-bilge. Like I said before, everything was shut off when I left the boat."
68546,irishfield,2007-05-07 02:52:00,26272,"$30 for a float switch to put in series with the one you have or to put on a seperate switch. Good for rainy nights!  Situation really sucks and I feel for ya young one.  BTW, least of your worries right now.. But who put the registration on the boat? NO xxxxx instead of the proper ON XXXXX"
68548,young_one,2007-05-07 03:00:00,620,"Holy poop, your right. I suppose ON stands for Ontario? NO is definitely wrong? (I'm not experienced with boat plate) The dealer did the registration."
68549,irishfield,2007-05-07 03:01:00,26272,Bass Pro?  Yes it should be ON = Ontario
68565,BLACKFISH88,2007-05-07 04:19:00,191,I don't think it was wave action I can attest for that I was on the bay from 1am till 11am the next morning and it was calm until then the waves didn't pick up untill later in the afternoon between 1-3pm definetly a leak somewhere.
68576,Tarzan's Jane,2007-05-07 08:42:00,1183,"Do not settle for less than a new boat - as a future investor...I definitely will want to know what dealers to avoid should they not come through for you.  Please update us, Nancy"
68579,lew,2007-05-07 09:16:00,12767,"WOW. really sorry to hear about your bad luck !!  I agree with GCD, that spot you marked inside the transom appears too high above the water to be causing the problem, and my 1st thought was the transducer on the outside of the transom at the bottom. There's gonna be at least 2 holes drilled for that and possibly 4 and if the installer forgot to caulk the holes before fastening it, it would allow alot of water to come in past the screws.  Sure hope they get you fixed up fast so you don't miss out on too much of the season.  Please keep us informed"
68581,Greencoachdog,2007-05-07 10:28:00,8163,"You wouldn't have happened to have made the mistake of docking the boat with the transom (motor end) pointed to open water and the bow pointed to shore? I know people are saying there wasn't any wave action, but from all the fishin' reports... it sounds like there was alot of boat traffic out there. Boat wake can be worse than natural wave action."
68582,fliptheslop,2007-05-07 10:33:00,112,"They are going to ask you if the hull was facing the waves. I am familiar wit MHB and if you were on the inside docks you probaly drove in meaning that your hull was facing shore, if that the case i doubt you will find a leak, you got swamped, sorry but insurance may be your only recourse."
68589,aplumma,2007-05-07 11:06:00,6896,Sorry to hear about the problem. The first thing to do is remove everything that you can from the boat and get it dry. That means using a hair dryer on the electrical contacts and move alot of air thru areas that are closed off. You should pull the spark plugs on the motor and crank it thru by hand a few times then use the starter motor and pump thru for 5-10 seconds. Then send some fogging oil ( normal amount 1 second per plug hole) into each plug hole and replace the plugs but not the wire. Crank over for 5 seconds. Hook up the plug wires and start the motr using the water hose and run at an idle till it warms up. Go back to the electrical connetions and use a spray electrical contact cleaner on all of the connections you can reach remember to remove the fuses and spray down the socket and the fuses. Plug it all in and turn on the items to make sure they work. Take the boat back to the water and go fishing close to the dock. With the fact that you were fishing in the boat for quite awhile and no water appeared and you were careful not to hit any objects that could have holed the hull you need to prove to BPS that the boat leaks and were from before you should confront them. The area you circled on the transom is cosmetic and not below the waterline pointing it out will only weaken your case for replacement IF you can prove a leak. IF you have a leak keep your case to BPS that it leaks don't go off on bad fuses and lights that don't work you will only sound like you don't like the boat and looking for an excuse to return it. The way that this will likly playout is that you were swamped from wakes or waves. The good side is that it is freshwater and you will likly have no lasting damage from the water after all it gets wet when it rains. I would advise you to install a bilge pump that is twice the size that the factory pump is and make sure it has a float to take care of the times you are not their. Read the schematics for the auto pump most of them need to be wired to a switch and directly to the battery for them to protect you when the master/key is off.
68592,1leggedangler,2007-05-07 11:27:00,364,"Wow! so sorry to hear about your boat. Hope it all works out for your in the end with the littlest of aggravation. Just an FYI, try to not leave any tackle on board after a day of fishing, theft and vandals, sorry to preach.  All the best, 1leg"
68596,Daplumma,2007-05-07 11:45:00,1961,If this is a 4 stroke motor do not start until tou have changed the oil and filters.If it is a 2 stroke do as aplumma outlined above.Sorry to hear about your boat. Joe
68601,silveradosheriff,2007-05-07 12:20:00,1025,"Dude - that sucks, sorry to hear it!"
68609,Guidofisherman,2007-05-07 12:46:00,206,"Another suggestion. Don't rule out foul play. If the police contacted you, they should have a ""incident number"". If you did not get one from the reporting officer, get one! It may help authenticate the incident if you need to go a legal route or for insurance purposes. Alan"
