67951,Hookset,2007-05-04 23:44:00,367,"This pic is taken from one of my favorite Walleye spots. There's a face in the rock if you look close. To me it seems to be saying ""You just missed another fish dummy"" Wondering if anyone has a pic to share showing a face or something in a rock cliff or wall ?  Thanks,  "
71784,ccmtcanada,2007-05-15 12:05:00,7971,"Dont know how I missed this post...but I clearly see the face...and it doesn't look happy!!  Very cool picture.  I dont have one to add, but I agree...it's like it's watching over the lake....like a guardian.  How's the fishing there...you think it's warning the fish of your presence?? LOL."
71786,misfish,2007-05-15 12:08:00,29133,"If you look hard enough,you can see scooby doo,top left corner."
71789,Roy,2007-05-15 12:12:00,13728,"Strange what wind, rain and a little imagination can do to a rock face.  "
71794,Terry,2007-05-15 12:22:00,14456,I think I see someone in this rock  
71822,Danubian,2007-05-15 13:22:00,65,The Wise Old Chief.    BTW: Why all my pics are always reduced? Is there a setting I should change?
71840,Terry,2007-05-15 14:06:00,14456,I don't know I can't see any faces   
71871,misfish,2007-05-15 15:30:00,29133,Hey that looks like Wayne.
71872,misfish,2007-05-15 15:31:00,29133, Alls good Dan. We just click on them and they enlarge.Cool.
71876,Terry,2007-05-15 15:41:00,14456,there are 8 faces in my last one can you find and name them all photos from this website
71877,keram,2007-05-15 15:43:00,585,"Well, it is not a face, but with little bit of imagination you can see the Lion      and what about this elephant  "
71881,camillj,2007-05-15 16:02:00,1988, Well I found all 5 faces .. cant  name them  ... but I could swear I see a little jiggly churchy girl .. and I believe I also see a little (original) OFC logo in there too !
71882,misfish,2007-05-15 16:05:00,29133,"I see the Lion.laying there like a king.  The elephant,not seeing it."
71890,Hookset,2007-05-15 16:14:00,367,"ccmtcanada - I think there was a post going on about posting pictures the day I posted this, so it probably headed off the front page in a hurry lol. And yes, it's a great Walleye spot.  misfish - I can't see Scooby, but my girlfriend says I resemble Shaggy, if Shaggy was overweight........  Roy / Terry - The power of nature is incredible, why nature would want to display the 3 stooges plus Schemp and a picture of Wayne, I'm not sure but hey, it's nature.  Danubian - I'll keep lookin but I haven't seen it yet.  Keram - The Lion is very cool but I'm still looking for the elephant.   Thanks for the replies All. I like these kind of pics because I always wonder how many hundreds of years ago someone else looked at a rock and said ""Hey that looks like Wayne"" or whatever lol.   Hookset."
71891,keram,2007-05-15 16:18:00,585,"The elephant is laying too, and looking and you, Just something bad happened to his ears"
71892,easton13th,2007-05-15 16:20:00,371,I have one of Newfoundland I will try and scan (it worked I think). It is looking over the city of Cornerbook. The old man in the mountain  I see the elephant and the lion(better of the two) Impressive shots.    Easton
71900,Entropy,2007-05-15 17:03:00,747,I can only see the backside of an elephant.     .... not that I'm familiar with one.
71902,misfish,2007-05-15 17:14:00,29133,  He looking at you straight on.LOL  Very cool and fun thread.
71904,Terry,2007-05-15 17:21:00,14456,if you smoke the right stuff you can see lots of faces  
71911,keram,2007-05-15 17:32:00,585,here there is an elephant ( sort off )  
71916,Hookset,2007-05-15 17:38:00,367,"I see it now misfish. I wonder how many fish I will miss this weekend trying to point that one out to the G/F. Terry.....that's how I found the face in the first place lol, now I have more to find.  One of my fave pics was one posted by a member showing the ""Sleeping Giant"" on Superior. Was from a long time ago tho'.   Hookset."
71927,Danubian,2007-05-15 18:08:00,65," It's like a profile of an old man, Terry.  (Actually, the original has the right contrasts, but when I uploaded, it's either the browser or somthing else that flattened the contrasts.)  You can see the nose - to the right of the rock - and the scorched and wrinkled cheecks. The eyelid is kind of heavy and swollen. Anyway, I'll better trace it... Here..."
