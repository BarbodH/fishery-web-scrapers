Good Luck all and C&R one for me."

69803,Hookset,2007-05-10 01:59:00,367,"A WEDDING !?!?!?!? That's just wrong. I skipped out early on my girlfriend's sister's wedding a few years ago because they got married on Opening Bass Weekend. Her family got over it. I still missed opening morning though. Everyone needs to get married in the winter. Oh ya, good luck on the Bog.   Hookset."
69808,Dondorfish,2007-05-10 02:03:00,1000,   Couldn't agree more with ya - weddings should only be allowed in the winter - when there is no ice!!   Don

70217,jediangler,2007-05-10 22:27:00,1923,I was going to go walleye fishing this weekend but with the cold front coming through Friday night I think I'll try my luck with some pike instead. Winds changing from W to NW to N to NE to E by Sunday. High Friday 26C low Saturday 5C with a high of 15C. It won't keep me from fishing but I'm trying to increase my chances. Good luck to all who get out this weekend.
