71813,Entropy,2007-05-15 13:11:00,747,That didn't seem like a smart idea in the first place.  Is that ever done by any rescue org?
71870,tundra,2007-05-15 15:29:00,18,to quote Forrest Gump......stupid is as stupid does
71886,ccmtcanada,2007-05-15 16:10:00,7971,I dont think we have to worry about calling this guy for a tow...seems like he took care of any additional business.....you know...with his helicopter sitting at the bottom of the lake and all....LOL.
71894,easton13th,2007-05-15 16:23:00,371,WOW! That is amazing and stupid all in the same.  Easton
71915,Kirk,2007-05-15 17:36:00,347,Maybe the helicopter needed help landing
71917,Row Boat,2007-05-15 17:41:00,19,"Thanks for sharing, it's amazing how people can think ""hey, I got an idea"", and not see the potential consequences.  It's even more amazing to have a camera ready to capture these occurances.  RB"
71918,Headhunter,2007-05-15 17:41:00,5703,At least he had the common courtesy to create an new artificial reef with his helicopter!  I wonder if the GPS points are available! HH
72012,Dondorfish,2007-05-15 22:41:00,1000,  LOL - Thats what I was thinking! - Obviously the cameraman is on a different boat - why not use that boat to tow them in?  HMMMMMMM........................   Don  
72016,Clampet,2007-05-15 22:45:00,1947,I think he needed a longer length of rope.
72034,Muskieman,2007-05-15 23:29:00,2472,ya gotta wonder sometimes.... was that a Sea King helicopter?
72079,Rizzo,2007-05-16 00:57:00,4754,Is anyone truly that stupid?
72150,Stern Rules,2007-05-16 04:07:00,342,I remember seeing that clip before and I believe that was supposed to be a shoot for a movie but the copter wasn't supposed to crash.
