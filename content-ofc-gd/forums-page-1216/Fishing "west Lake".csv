71966,huntervasili,2007-05-15 20:14:00,1604,"Ok all I am going to be out on west lake (PEC) near sandbanks PP, this weekend and was wondering if anyone has any idea of some good baits in there... Think its pike and walleye if I am not mistaken... any and all help is greatly appreciated!  Bill"
71968,Hookset,2007-05-15 20:28:00,367,"Good Bass too Bill,  (when season opens, as you pointed out  For a hoot go over to the shoreline that runs along the sandbank separating West Lake from Lake Ontario. Wade the shoreline (all sandy) and cast to the isolated clumps of floating weeds. You can walk for almost a mile casting to these clumps and they hold lots of Largies. Kind of a nice break from boat fishing while the ladies sunbathe on the beach. Just don't get confused and cast to the ladies. They fight waaaaay too hard. But if you find a lure the ladies hit on, let me know.  Hookset."
71970,huntervasili,2007-05-15 20:30:00,1604,Wont be targetting bass as it is this coming weekend and bass is out of season... thanks for the help though
71971,BLACKFISH88,2007-05-15 20:31:00,191,You might wanna check the regs on bass in that area but I'm sure the season is closed untill somewhere near the end of June. Try spinners and worms for the eyes and pike find some shoals and troll away......
71972,Hookset,2007-05-15 20:32:00,367,"Oh ya good point - I suppose my misguided info. would fall under ""future reference"". Sorry about that Bill. I got all excited. I didn't have much luck with the Walleye when I was there. Most people I saw were drifting thru the mid lake where the deeper water is. The lake doesn't have a lot of features and the Walleye that I did get were off the main point at the north east end. there's a trailer park / campsite there. File my bass info. for a few weeks.   Hookset."

72010,sirfish,2007-05-15 22:37:00,175,Try a slow troll or drift on the west side of the lake where there is a channel leading out of the lake. Had good success there about 8 yrs ago. If drifting a luckystrike victor spinner with a worm or a go-getter .
72072,Rizzo,2007-05-16 00:47:00,4754,Find the weedline and troll parallel to the sandbanks.  Catch every species there
