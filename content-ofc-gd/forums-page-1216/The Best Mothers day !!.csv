71277,Jen,2007-05-14 02:35:00,833,"The day started off at a reasonable hour, 10:00am or so , although my camera like my eyes was having a hard time adjusting.  Setting up    First fish of the day, I was so jealous, slippery little guy!    Wasn't but moments and then it was my turn!    And again!  Wow    Then a quick break for some artistic photography of a couple of the smaller fish that were put on the boat.      Then I pulled in this double header...    Next thing you know, fish on , times two!    All in all there were over 30 salmon brought into the boat, a couple got away, heartbreaking moments for sure.  My PB for the day was a 34"" beautiful fish,    The best mothers day gift in the entire world,  a chartered fishing trip, sun, wind, great people, and a whole lot of fish...  Thank you to my family ... and FISHMASTER for an awesome day on the big pond.  All but four of the fish caught today were live release, what a sight watching them swim away!    FISHMASTER even cleaned them so that they would be ready for Mothers day dinner.    The perfect end to a perfect day... !  Cheers,  Jen"
