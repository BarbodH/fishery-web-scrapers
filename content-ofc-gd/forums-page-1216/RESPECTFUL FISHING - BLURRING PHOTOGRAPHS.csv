69804,glirw,2007-05-10 01:59:00,200,"This talk about bad apples , are we talking about people who leave behind more than just foot prints ? Or are we talking about people who use your OFC posts to find new fishing spots ?  As far as ticked off property owners go, even if fishermen/women clean up after themselves , if they come in droves , no parking and No Trespassing signs can and will still be put up due to noise, too many cars, or simply lack of privacy for the person suffering from the fisherpeople's presence .  Lads and lasses, it's very simple. When we post a report , we know from the get go whether or not we had success, or lack there-of in a secret honey-hole , or a popular spot , like Centre Island.  If you're concerned about your fishing spot , then shoot towards the ground, mask it out, or don't post a picture at all , and be brief in your report , or don't report at all ! It's your choice how conservative an approach to take.  If you caught a bucket of big crappies from Cannal Road or what not, lets face it , everyone knows cannal road , just like everyone knows of Centre Island , then you will know that whether you post or not , the fishermen will keep coming; some will get skunked, and some will find the fish.  If you post a honey hole , and that upsets other OFNers , it's not a honey hole, just another fishing spot .       Another way to solve this issue is to switch to Carp fishing. We Carpers never face shoulder to shoulder fishing. Plenty of ridicule, but little pressure"
69809,snag,2007-05-10 02:04:00,1932,"I agree,  I've only taken issue with posts that literally can put you within 3 feet of where the pic was taken.  That's all."
71905,lucid,2007-05-15 17:21:00,9,"Agreed Grant.  I've been doing what Aron said these days. I try to take photos of fish on an angle that doesn't give away the spot. Infact, I was just cropping a few pics right now. One of them I can't even post because it's just too obvious and it's one of my favourite spots. I've said too much in the past and it's part of the reason I don't post reports so much any more.  I also think what Erik said about the fishery is true. I still see and catch plenty of fish. I haven't been skunked yet this year. Although, I never specifically divulge a select few spots. Maybe that has something to do with it.  The litter thing is extremely disturbing. It's a crying shame if a good spot gets shut down for that reason. I just don't understand how people can leave garbage lying around like that. I think disrespectful fishermen is the biggest problem here.  I'll probably post reports this season. But it's unlikely anyone who doesn't already know the spot by heart will recognize where it is. It's just safer that way.  Cheers  EDIT: And greggy is right about other reasons why spots get shut down. Droves are droves, and are usually not too welcome outside of places such as woodstock."
71959,snag,2007-05-15 19:45:00,1932,"Cool Dougy,  I want to clear up some confusion. Meant to do this earlier but thought this was a dead horse.  Toronto islands may have unlimited fish but not spots. If islanders are serious, they may reduce angling areas.  Areas inside and around marinas are already restricted.  Last year I had a talk with a resident who said that they wanted picnic areas and any boat mooring spots restricted. She said a couple folks wanted more ""sanctuary"" designations too.  She indicated Hanlans point to the Trout pond and the Bandstand shore. Wards island near the ferry is also under attack. She did mention some other areas but at the time, I can't remember them or if they were even fishing spots. I wasn't really paying attention.   1. Bandstand shore- Apparently, picnickers complained about people fishing. Dangerous hooks flying about, disturbing nature, litter (smoke butts, tackle, food garbage, etc.)  2. Hanlans point to the Trout pond- mostly for boaters and some picnickers. same as above  3. Wards island near the ferry- the marina there wants the same restrictions as ALL OTHER ISLAND MARINAS-NO FISHING. They are tired of trespassers on the docks and sick of avoiding fishing lines when leaving the marina.  I told her that fishing provides tourism to the island. She said they did a study and it really didn't generate much. The school groups and general population during the height of summer paid the rent.  She also said that accidental garbage was an issue (fishing line). Boaters complained about it's presence. I said it was probably coming from Lake O than from shore fisherman. She seemed to care less.  I would also like to know what time of year these anglers are the biggest nuisance.  Anyways, just another reason, for me to be more cautious.  I know it's not us. We are good anglers Of course.  For the record: The original thread wasn't intended to transfix on the islands anyways.  I'm sure this rings true just about anywhere though.  "
71979,007,2007-05-15 20:52:00,537,"Hey snog, if they did indeed restrict fishing at the locations on the Islands mentioned - that would be the end of most of my best fishing spots!  Though during July and August Hanlans to Trout Pond is pretty much a no go as there are so many boats moored in the way of prime LM bass fishing water. Perhaps us shore anglers should complain about all those boats preventing us from fishing public areas!  Can't resist..... How can the residents of the Islands complain about litter and mess - have you seen most of their front gardens, they're like junkyards! LOL  Edit... Just remembered, while I was down at the islands this winter I saw a number of old rusty kitchen appliances that local kids had found lying around and had decided to drop onto the ice from the bridge at Wards Island (now presumably on the bottom of the channel) - perhaps a real indicator of how much the locals care about their environment down there!  That said there is a problem with litter caused by anglers in the GTA - but my guess is these are casual anglers and the kind of people who probably litter regardless of whether they are fishing or not in which case its a wider education issue."
71980,bigfish1965,2007-05-15 21:01:00,3382,Remind them that only the MNR or the Federal Government may impose fishing restrictions. It is not within municipal or regional government powers to do so.
71982,snag,2007-05-15 21:08:00,1932," Actually,  I did kinda say that to her. I'm not sure if they were putting pressure on them to make changes.  This brought up the whole marina/water/leasing discussion a while back.  Like I said,  I wasn't completely paying attention, fishing was on the brain   I also added what a bunch of slobs boaters can be sometimes be. I remarked on the garbage they ""accidentally"" lose annually."
69455,aplumma,2007-05-09 11:00:00,6896," Here I thought I posted pictures of a fishing trip so you all can see other places and styles of fishin. I guess Glen should stop sending them winter time care packages that he puts together to help us all thru the cold season. I post a fishing trip not just pictures of fish, I like that shot of up the river and the sunset or the heron even if their is a sign that says Occuquan Bay in front of it. I also like to show what the days effort has yielded in fish for the table or the results of a good hunt. Break out the cameras people take pictures of what you love to do add a few photos of areas that you drove by that have no fish mix them in if you are afraid of fishing stalkers. I have yet to envy someone from the number of big fish they have photos of I however have been fishing with some really great fisherman who have shared knowledge and trips that impressed me for life and by their wishes still go unnamed. So please dont think of it a E braggin that would make me stop posting my trips because it is not the spirit/reason  that I post in.   Art"

69515,ccmtcanada,2007-05-09 13:38:00,7971,"Wow...this subject is always a bit touchy.  My reports have lots of pictures in them...I try to make my reports stories...and not just ""here my pics"".  Snog does a great job at this as well...and in a lot of cases, his story is more interesting than the pic!!  His pic only helps tell the story...dont care if they are blurred...it still added to the story.  Bly and I have a few secret spots, but we are fortunate that those spots produce only at night...so there is no background anyways.  I am very conscious about what's in the background in pics....it is possible to take them where it's still nice and scenic, avoiding the blurred out photoshopping.  If I post a pic that even remotely is questionable, I always say ""PM me if you have any issues about these pics"".  I have never received a PM wanting me to take down a pic.  I think both sides have valid points....if someone posts something questionable, perhaps just send a friendly  PM asking them to edit the pic....I'd venture to say that 99% of them will thank you for pointing it out to them....as most are newer to the board and just dont know."
69542,tbayboy,2007-05-09 14:34:00,1497,"Its a tough one; for example what if the report states ""I went over the bridge just past xxx town and hung a right and went by that old dock and caught non stop 30 inch+ pike."" then has a picture of a big fish.  Hiding the picture won't help.  If I recall the post that started this was a 'friend' being taken to a site who then ruined the site - didn't start with a picture here at all.  I totally understand the blurring of pictures to hide sites but I've learned more about locations from this site from descriptions then from pictures (being new to the GTA fishing scene I don't recognize landmarks but I can google place names and learn from the rest of the description).  Anyhow, I have no problem with blurring photos to hide locations or making people sign up to see them (besides which more users = more advertising fees for the site = less slow loading days) but I don't think thats the only problem, people writing reports (AND PLEASE DON'T STOP WRITING THEM - WE LOVE THEM) just need to take the whole report into consideration if its a spot they'd like to keep to themselves."
69785,snag,2007-05-10 01:30:00,1932,"WOW,  That's why I appreciate this site and you.  Sorry but time is short, I have to feed my 1yr. old son, and,  I am too technically challenged to respond individually so I'll say this;  1. I support Rick O's thread which is a great idea initiated by: Bill Parker, I believe,  2. Grilw, For the record, My ego's an exageration, I enjoy participation, . A true egotist would divulge locations for self gratification.  3. Please see what is happening now. Brian (Misfish) has it right; view convervation now to preserve future opportunities  4. Chrome Hen and Fish on thanks; We need to clean up after ourselves and others unfortunately  5. Peace, EHG  6. Mepps (stumpy a la more') I'm not a fan of censorship. I'm only interested in preservation and conservation here. We bare the responsibility of information disemination to deter unrightious exploitation .  7. Dsn, we've shared many a spot and the wanting emails requesting locals. I'm trying to save one of our spots.  8. Mr.Thorpe knows a thing or two about preservation, Thanks Marc!!!!!!!!!!  9. Aplumma, RIGHT ON! Post it baby! big, small, quantity, skunk and all beloved misc. , just do it.  10. CCMT, Can't wait to meet you two.  11. Ricola, Thanks for getting me on board and some great trips together. You are right. The internet is too powerful sometimes and I think we all forget that.  In addition everyone, Please remember this post years from now. We are at a turning point in immediate information exchange. There are Bad apples inside and outside this site. We can only control our own house. So, lets just take responsibility here at least.  Babies crying, adios!!  Thanks,  S."
69150,Terry,2007-05-08 17:03:00,14456,"mixed feelings here  I had a kawartha lake buggered up because of photos I posted..it only took 3 weeks and the spot was dead....so I do know what you mean...... but the fish should only be part of the reason we fish..I enjoy the scenery behind the angler and not to know where they are fishing but because I like the scenery ....  and it kinda kills the idea of what the internet is for...  and I have seen people get upset just because someone posted the name of their favourite lake  I don't know, I guess we need to find a balance some where some how"
69159,Kirk,2007-05-08 17:39:00,347,Toronto? wheres that? anyone have GPS coordinates? can we fish from shore?
69170,Mako,2007-05-08 18:13:00,25,"One technique instead of blurring is to shot from a different angle.  The angler with the fish crouching and the camera guy standing shooting down ward.  Unless your those crazy trout float guys that screams ""I know that pebble in the shot...how could you!"" the shots should hide any land marks."
69172,kennyman,2007-05-08 18:21:00,737,"I agree to a point, but I too am worried that posts like this deter people from posting at all. I am learning all the time from this board and suck up as my much info as my tiny little brain will hold. I guess that posting exact locations may be wrong I still don't see anything wrong with pics (within reason). For example I love hearing something like ""I was looking for gators on the south west side of the island, throwing a flame tiger husky jerk in a #13 all morning (nice day by the way,water was like glass), but had more success with the silver/black HJ-10 "". To me that followed with a pic of the guy(oops, or girl) holding a gator with the HJ#10 hanging out of it's mouth and the Toronto skyline behind them would be perfect. If he happens to get a rock or tree in the picture, oh well. If someone can differentiate between rocks or trees on the island they know it well anyway. From a distance using the skyline (CN tower) as a guide you'd have a hard time telling precisely where they were standing or at least I would. You may get the general vicinity (within a half mile), but that's not exactly GPS coordinates is it? If that's not acceptable, what is? How close should we come in describing an area we're fishing in? Who gets to set the guidelines? I'm not trying to be an arse, just that so much of acceptability is in opinion and perception. I understand and agree with the general principle, I'm just not sure where the line should be drawn."
69191,aplumma,2007-05-08 19:17:00,6896,This is kind of funny because I am a member of a board that is for catfishing that is nationally known. It is broken down into type of catfish and states with even specific bodies of water. The site owners  on their have a filter that to view attachments you must be a member which some hide their photos behind but in the long run just make the site have more members. The photos are not blurred and the members all openly say were they were fishing and when they are going to be back out their. It is like lining up a fishin party with a group of friends rather than a contest as to were you can catch the secret fish. Granted the catfishin population practice catch and release of the big fish and only keep the 3-5 lbers for food. I can start a thread to the board and have a fishing guide give me a list of spots that he has been getting the bite on lately and even invited me out for a free trip since I was having such a bad run in figuring out the patterns.Since he did that I gave him a long list of places to try when he comes up to my neck of the river and a free trip if he wants it. I am not sure if the difference is the people or the amount of people that make the difference between fishin the North and fishin around here. I have always treated the people up North when I am fishing the same way I treat the catfishin community here giving spots or lures or trips to people who are not having much success. Most have given back a lasting friendship or a laugh or a beer for the opportunity to turn a fishin trip into a catchin trip. I am not sure their is an answer that will cover everyones zone of comfort however if you see me and you are fishless I will be happy to give you the lure off my line and a direction to fish it.   Art
69196,snag,2007-05-08 19:25:00,1932," Yes I did thank them. We still fish together. Lucid is marrying my sister.  I'm not being a martyr (don't you have to die first?) I'm not worried about fish stocks being depleted either.  I'm more concerned about spots being shut down from us. Which I think is reasonable.  I just went to O.P. and in 1/2 an hour saw more fishing tackle gabage and met an idiot who said he was trying to snag suspending pike. Obviously not an OFNer but if a moron like that used his computer to find a spot I posted, well maybe I would just die and then I'd be a martyr  Thanks ehg"
69200,snag,2007-05-08 19:41:00,1932," Thanks OO7,  I had blurring/photoshopping. I agree with you and Mako about better photographic practices. Sometimes the only place to set-up the camera is on a rock that shows your locale.  I haven't been out much and I'm kinda doing what my mentors have done and not really post anything under 30"".  Thanks for the kind words"
69201,snag,2007-05-08 19:44:00,1932," I agree.  It's the posts where you can tell EXACTLY where someone is that's the issue for me.  We are one, brother"
69203,snag,2007-05-08 19:50:00,1932," Yeah, a whole lake is kinda touchy, unless it's the musky guys territory..................."
69210,snag,2007-05-08 20:12:00,1932, I'm the same way. The problem here is that in an urban center opportunities are reduced and access can be terminated.  Love to have seen T.O. 300 years ago.
69221,lookinforwalleye,2007-05-08 20:59:00,4399,"Personally I tend to ignore pictures that have been doctored I have no interest in them go buy a fish from the fish store and photo shop that to me it has the same effect. Do you guys get upset when one of the local fishing shows do an episode from a local lake seems to me that would have a much more negative affect.  The way I look at this subject is simple these spots that people want to try and keep all to themselves have been around for years and no doubt the protectionist out there were probably introduced to the ""spot"" by a fellow angler,magazine,internet site etc. and now they want to try and keep the spot to themselves seems kind of selfish to me.  Who died and left you king of the ""spot"""
69226,The Urban Fisherman,2007-05-08 21:21:00,2050,"Meh, try your best to take a picture with a neutral, but attractive backround, and if at the end of the day you're still worried about it, go ahead and blurr away!  I'm not a fan of it myself, as it takes away from what could be a nice looking shot - but hey, if it makes ""said"" fisherman feel better about his/her fishin' spot then go for it.  We all know it's the few dummies out there that are ruining it for the rest of us.  I have a limited time frame for fishing therefore I fish relatively well known spots and time and time again I see the same old thing.  ""part-timers"" who don't have licences, keep everything they catch, and leave all their carbage behind.  I fish 100% artificials (except for corn hah) and somehow I always end up leaving with a few worm containers?  I hate to say it Snag, and I hope I'm wrong, but I don't think it's going to get much better anytime soon.  How many ""no fishing zones"" have you seen switched back to ""ok to fish"" spots?  I could be WAY wrong on this call though, because I am still newish to the GTA.  Weirdest thing to me is the amount of coconuts in the Credit!!  I didn't know there were palm trees in Toronto? heh  Cheers, UF"
