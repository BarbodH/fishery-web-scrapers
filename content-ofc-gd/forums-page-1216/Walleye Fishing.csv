72029,danbouck,2007-05-15 23:16:00,4380,"I'm planning on Dunnville this weekend, then puslinch in Cambridge. I've never been to Dunnville but Puslinch is about 10 -15 feet, clear water"
72030,Muskieman,2007-05-15 23:22:00,2472,"usually if you fish a river ... a 3/8 os jighead /trailer ... worm  .. chartreuse ,light pink  or white jigs are a safe bet. if yer fishin lake with clear water light colored 5/16 jigs tipped with 2"" 3"" shiner works well . if yer fishin stained lakes.. chartreuse/orange 3/8 jigs  tipped with ared or yellow dace minnow works well too. if fishin's slow try a lindy rig type set up .. with a minnow or a worm.. and if the water is warm enough you can even try a leech.. although it's still pretty early for leeches. i'll be putting my tips to the test this weekend. GOOD LUCK!!  hope i've been of some help. p.s try casting a big Rapala over your spot before using live bait.. it usually produces more active and bigger fish..if they're there  especially in a river.   Randy"
