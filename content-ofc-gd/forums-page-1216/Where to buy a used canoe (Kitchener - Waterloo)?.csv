Anybody know of a used floating canoe for sale in the Waterloo / GTA region?  I was looking to purchase one to go for the occasional canoeing / fishing trip. Any suggestions about types of canoes?  I hear that Scott's are pretty good, but pricey?  "
71207,Victor,2007-05-13 23:34:00,1609,"try looking at sites like ... craiglist, kijiji, buysell, etc.  they have alot of used canoes/boats on there ... you might not be able to find one in the KW region but i'm sure u can find some within an hour drive. That's how i got my used canoe.  Good luck with ur search"

71247,irishfield,2007-05-14 01:32:00,26272,Scotts are nice and yes like many brands can be expensive. Leah bought her 16 foot Prospector at the mfg in New Liskeard as a scratch and dent and think she paid around $2 grand for it. 1/2 the price of the Langford she had looked at.

71523,JFR,2007-05-14 19:41:00,498,"Why not try Swife Canoe and Kayak Co in Dwight Ontario  http://www.swiftcanoe.com/  The company make fantastic canoes, and at the end of the season sell their rental fleet. When you contact them enquire about their travelling sales show. I think they make a stop in Kitchener.   When I was able to trip into Algonquin Park, I would always rent their canoes, stable, lightweight, and can carry a large load.  John"

71728,Weeds,2007-05-15 03:39:00,782,"Just checked, there's one, a 12 foot Sportspal on Craigslist(toronto) for 125 bucks. Looks like a good deal for someone, located 45 minutes north of Barrie. If I hadn't just got one I'd snag it myself."
