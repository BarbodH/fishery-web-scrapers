Firstly, our very own Pam Dallaire painted a picture of my daughters testing the water temperature last year during Pike/Trout/Whitefish opener on Simcoe. I received the paintings in the mail and had some frames made and presented one to my Wife and one to my Mother in Law for Mother's day....  Special thanks to Pam. Both said they have never received such a beautiful gift, for any occasion!  The girls and my wife....    The girls and my mother in law....    And then today for ""Good spouse/son in law day"" (only sometimes celebrated after mother's day), I received some goodies...  Lowrance LMS 525C dumb ass, Navionics Gold+ Eastern Great Lakes, 12 Cabela's Walleye lures and a Tie Fast Magnum    Who's coming over to help me install this fishfinder??? LOL  -Brian"

72027,danc,2007-05-15 23:09:00,4677,"Very nice Brian. I didn't receive any fishing goodies in the mail lately, but I did receive a Pamela Dallaire print of a cougar photo that I took a while back. It is simply amazing. I have it framed in the house and everyone that walks in asks about it. When I tell them the story and then show them the photo that was the blueprint for the painting, they are awestruck. The eyes of the cougar in the painting are hypnotizing.  Geez. I just went to Pams web site to find my print on the front page. Pamela did this painting for the Ontario Puma Foundation. Thanks again Pamela.  Pamelas web site    "
