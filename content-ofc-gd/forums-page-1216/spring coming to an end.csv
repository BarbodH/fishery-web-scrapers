71975,LipDip,2007-05-15 20:43:00,39,"Those aren't from a 'spring's' worth Raf....those were two weekends, remember?! One in April and two weeks ago for pike opener. Four days fishin (Sunday's always a half-day, too). On  the trip with HipTrip, 350 pics were shot on three cameras. There have been a few pics left out ha ha. Look out walleye this wknd! Really notice a difference in Raf's/Ben's cameras vs. mine too, no contest in terms of photo quality."

72000,danc,2007-05-15 22:00:00,4677,Stellar report guys. Thanks for sharing.
72002,mepps,2007-05-15 22:04:00,1301,great job Raf!
72081,Cookslav,2007-05-16 01:01:00,1457,Wow...great start to the season bud! If the rest of your season carries on like that your in for a heck year! Thanks for shareing.
72186,Raf,2007-05-16 11:52:00,3495,"FinS, the usual suspects, spoons, spinners and minnow baits.  We'd sometimes take a hot bait off just to see what else we can get to work.  I think LipDip has an article on ice-out trout in the March or April '06 OFC newsletter that summarizes this topic well.  Thanks gang.  Spring is a great time of the year, air is crisp, trees are budding, wildlife is abundant.  Don't wait till the end of may or you'll miss some of the best fishn to be had."
71672,Raf,2007-05-15 01:09:00,3495,"to me, May 2-4 pretty much symbolizes the end of spring, beginning of summer.  sure the nights have been cold and it may not quite feel like summer yet but sure as shoot we'll be complaining about the stifling heat soon enough.  not sure yet if I will be out this weekend or not but i thought i'd post a photo summary of how the spring season has gone.  'eeeeeeeeeere we go  first fish didnt take very long    or the 2nd    there were some double headers    and double releases    some great action          and some nice fish        yeah, even some personal bests          fabulous sunsets    ...and best of all, FISH WITH TEETH!    Bring on the summer!"
