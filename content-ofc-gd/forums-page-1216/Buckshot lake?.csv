It was the only lake that had a depth reading (5.6 meters).  Apparently it is a very clean lake with no invasive species.  The fish in the lake were Lake Trout, walleye, largemouth, and smallmouth bass. Bass is closed till 4th Saturday in June. However,  i know little about fishing oligotrophic lakes for LT, or pickerel and never fished this lake.  Good luck,  ehg"

There are three places that would make good starting points on that lake.  There is an underwater point running out to deep water on the southwest shore, just north of Buckshot Creek. Can be good for Walleye, on north side it falls into deep water, good for Lakers.  There is a shoal off the east shore in the narrows that drops into deep water.  There is a shoal off the northwest side of Craig Island surrounded by a large flat.  Hope this helps."
