71612,Victor,2007-05-14 23:00:00,1609,thanks to all the admin for the amazing work they're doing ... that's why OFC is the best
71614,tjsa,2007-05-14 23:06:00,1578,"Glad I was at work, and missed it(hate reading those kind of posts, or any other inflammatory posts) that can cause members to get bent all out of shape.  Glad it was turfed, and that the mods were on top of it. Thats why we have 5 moderators here(at least), to be able to be on top of things every second of every minute of every day, so that this kind of crap gets nipped in the bud right away.  Kudos to you guys for sacrificing your time during the days, evenings, weekends, being either at work, at home, on holidays, etc. etc. You must have to talk to each other a lot to make sure at least one of you is around here when the others have some other things to do during your everyday life. (I was asked if I wanted to be a mod, but I could not commit any significant time to it, if ya can believe that, lol see my post count).  And, members, if you see an inflammatory post, logged on, or not, then log in, and hit the ""report"" button on the bottom left of the post, so that a mod can be notified a.s.a.p. DO NOT respond to it, it just fans the flames."
71618,pezeveng,2007-05-14 23:08:00,6,Even though Iam not a regular poster I do a lot of lurking I find that this site is one of the most tamed and helpful ones on the net.  A few other boards I frequent are horrible with the trash and the racism.  Way to keep a great board clean and informative.  
71619,silveradosheriff,2007-05-14 23:09:00,1025,Zero Tolerance!
71621,Tarzan's Jane,2007-05-14 23:13:00,1183,"Great stuff, glad I missed it, happy to know that it got taken care of without having to vote      OFC is family and I am more than proud right now to be a part of it."
71626,express168,2007-05-14 23:40:00,327,"I am glad I missed it, we are all fishermen or women here, race is not an issue. ALL WELCOME! Great work by the Admins."
71632,ccmtcanada,2007-05-14 23:50:00,7971,"Wow...thanks everyone for the words of support...Joey...you are too funny...LOL.  Growing up as a visible minority, I've had my share of racial comments.  I know that the majority of people are not like that, so I concentrate my life on those people.  My post on this thread said it was ""somewhat directed at me"".  I didn't mean to imply that it was explicitly about me.  Thanks everyone...the situation has been taken care of...I'm still the happy camper I was before that guy posted his topic.  Now...let's just get back to fishing!!!  Cliff"
71634,douG,2007-05-14 23:55:00,2693,Cliff = Class.  Best to you and Carole.
71640,Gerritt,2007-05-15 00:06:00,6129,now... if only we could learn the ancient time tested secret to catching massive PICKERAL!....   Cliff your a class act... I am honoured to call you friend.   Gerritt.
71495,bigfish1965,2007-05-14 19:06:00,3382,"Someone decided to post a horrendously insulting racial attack on here today. Neither myself nor any of the admins here will tolerate any type of racial comments. You will not be allowed to post here ever again. There is no warning, there is no second chances. If you do it, you are done and if you try and come back under another name I will very quickly report your actions to the Internet Service Provider you are using. They will take your service down in two seconds. If that doesn't work I will ban your IP range. I'd rather lose a few viewers than risk some racist idiot ever coming on this site again. I am deeply embarassed to even have to make this post. I thought we were somehow above this crap. To those who were offended by the post, please accept our sincerest apologies. The comments were in no way indicative of the feelings of this site or (I hope) the vast majority of members."
71498,Roy,2007-05-14 19:16:00,13728,"Well done, Rick."
71500,ccmtcanada,2007-05-14 19:19:00,7971,"Rick...I read it...shook my head (as it was somewhat directed at me), and replied.  Roy saw it as I was posting and it was gone.  My reply (which would have been the first) never saw the light of day....that's how quickly it was taken care of.  No need to apologize Rick...you guys cant read the minds of the people posting.  I knew right away that that post didn't reflect the members of this great board.  I do applaud you and the rest of the moderating team....you are all stand up people, who takes care of business quickly."
71502,JFR,2007-05-14 19:20:00,498,"Late arrival today, seems like I missed quite a bit, or maybe not.  Thanks Rick for taking care of it.  John"
71503,Terry,2007-05-14 19:20:00,14456,"yeah, I saw it and made a great big reply on why he should not post things like that just to find the thread was gone, as it should be gone"
71509,Gerritt,2007-05-14 19:25:00,6129,"While I missed the post... glad I did, there seems to be quite a few posts recently that have a heavy racial undertone to them. Good job on cleaning it up fellas... perhaps this will pose as a lesson that there are consequences to your actions. So to those few that feel the need to make racist comments in threads heed this as your warning.   Good job guys,  Gerritt."
71511,Whopper,2007-05-14 19:27:00,2174,"Well put Gerritt, don't know how i missed it glad I did.  Good job fellas!  Whopper"
71512,motv8tr,2007-05-14 19:31:00,2587,"Hmmmm...think I'm glad I missed that one....I can't believe how on top of things you guys are Rick, good job as always.  It's sad that such things still exist in todays age.  Maureen"
71519,tonyb,2007-05-14 19:38:00,1637,"I am amazed at how much racism there is out there still, I used to keep my mouth shut, but now I always speak up when someone makes any kind of racial remark.  Zero tolerance around me.  Remember...everyone except native Indians are technically 'immigrants'.  Tony"
71528,just2manylures,2007-05-14 19:50:00,144,"I didn't see the post, but I think your policy is 100% dead on.  There is no place for that here.  Great job keeping on top of things."
71531,BFSC Kevin,2007-05-14 19:54:00,1351,boy that went by fast. i didn't even get to see it.
71533,Row Boat,2007-05-14 20:01:00,19,"We all got a good thing going here at the generosity of the moderators. Membership to this board should always be considered a privilege.  Those that have an intolerable viewpoint, get out of our board, your kind is unwanted here.   Now how does it feel ?  RB"
71535,misfish,2007-05-14 20:05:00,29133,"  How can anyone say anything bad about this guy???????????????????? You got to be the most straight shooter in the bunch Cliff.  Now me,I can see it happening....................  Leave the board for 15 minutes I misit.  Probly a good thing."
71540,snag,2007-05-14 20:11:00,1932,Racism is the purest form of ignorance and stupidity.  I'm in an interacial marriage and get to see racists of all colours.  I like to poke fun at cultural stereotypes but try not to cross the line  Thanks again Mods
71542,lunkerbasshunter,2007-05-14 20:13:00,2585,glad i didnt see it and im glad the mods took care of it!  Cheers!
71545,Joey,2007-05-14 20:16:00,9122,"I agree Brian.  If I see anyone say anything bad about Cliff, I'll personally take them behind the woodshed and lay a whoopin on em!!!!  Kudos to the Admins and thanks Rick, you're the best.  Joey"
71548,Jen,2007-05-14 20:20:00,833,"I as well read the post and shook my head, refreshed the page and it was gone...  Not only attentive but efficient!  Well done!  Jen"
71550,daisy_girl58,2007-05-14 20:22:00,116,"Gotta love this board! My Daddy had a term to go by.....He said someday you just might be out in the middle of nowhere and you never do know who will help you in a time of need....Can't be choosy then, may never get a second chance!  Lorissa"
71554,Gerritt,2007-05-14 20:35:00,6129,ok who hid the chip dip??.  Gerritt.
71572,easton13th,2007-05-14 21:05:00,371,Thanks! I am sure all the proper actions were taken.  Easton
71595,Bernie,2007-05-14 22:01:00,3190,As a child one of my best friends was a native. He lived across the street from me. We did a lot of things together and had a lot of fun. I remember his father built a huge slide out of ice and snow for us. What a great family they were. It was a very sad day when his father was transferred to another place. Never in my family was it said anything bad about other races or religion. It doesn't matter where people come from there can be good and bad and has nothing to do with race. There is absolutely no place for racism here at all. Way to go mods!!
71600,Clampet,2007-05-14 22:25:00,1947,"Hard to beleive or understand how anyone could possibly say anything negative about ole Cliffy. He is without a doubt one of the nicest people (along his wife, Carol) on this board."
71601,ketchenany,2007-05-14 22:30:00,3229,"Glad you threw out the ""garbage"" Rick."
71604,Terry,2007-05-14 22:32:00,14456,"people it had nothing to do with any one person..it was a b!tch fest on a whole race of people, but he had every right to be offended"
71611,Roy,2007-05-14 22:46:00,13728,"No, it didn't have anything to do with any one person but it IS ironic that when this 'lesser' joined, the first person to welcome him was an ""Oriental"".  We just won't put up with the crap.  At least I won't."
