Tried again after lunch and I must say, it's running much faster!  I'll have to try at home...where most of the problems have been.  I did notice though that the number of people browsing the board is back up to over 200....a big improvement over the past few weeks for this time of day."
71462,Terry,2007-05-14 18:33:00,14456,looking good here at the office so far..thanks

Anyone still experiencing issues will have to contact their ISP. We've done all we can."

71741,Badger Shark,2007-05-15 04:44:00,291,Seems very fast to me.  Nice to see you guys on top of things.
71754,aplumma,2007-05-15 10:31:00,6896,Hey thanks guys the new server is blazing fast here in the states. The old server was slow and sometimes would not allow a post to go thru here also so I am not sure how that ties in with the Rogers explanation. I sure hope that TJ can sell enough ads to pay the new bills. Thanks again for working on the board and keeping it healthy Dr. Rick and co DR'S.   Art
