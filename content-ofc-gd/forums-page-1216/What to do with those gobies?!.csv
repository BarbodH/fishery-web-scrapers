71688,michaelkovacs,2007-05-15 01:51:00,48,"So, what's your policy?  I don't often go panfishing, but when I'm getting skunked all day, anything will do!  I was fishing off of Lake O. in a little inlet, and caught a few gobies off of my nightcrawler rig (was fishing for perch).  When I didn't throw them back, another guy (that had his son with him) looked at me like I was some cold-blooded freak for not putting them back.  On the opposite end, I was perch fishing and one guy came beside me, took 5 minutes and caught about 12 gobies.  Then he cut them up, alive mind you, into chunks which he proceeded to use for the perch fishing.  Just curious what everyone else does.  cheers, MK"
71700,Dondorfish,2007-05-15 02:02:00,1000,destroy any and all of them  Don
71701,brandon,2007-05-15 02:04:00,857,yeah most will destroy them however its illegal to use them for bait I believe
71705,xrap,2007-05-15 02:14:00,683,i feed em to the seaguls
71724,wolfville,2007-05-15 03:22:00,396,"My son caught over 30 of them while I was busy fishing for carp the past Sat. At the end of day we put them in a bag, tightly tied, and they went to garbage can. I explained that we shouldn't put them back and why to my sons, and why we put most of other fish back."
71725,Dondorfish,2007-05-15 03:25:00,1000,Good on you Wolfville - teach em' young. Those things should have a bounty on them!   Don
71729,MJL,2007-05-15 03:40:00,2427,"If I get them, it's usually just one or two quick slams into a concrete slab, tree, wooden boardwalk or anything hard.  My friends usually step on them but I'd hate to soil my gore-tex hikers.  After I toss them back to become seagull or catfish food.  For those who are wondering, they can go 45+ yards using a carp sling shot with a carrying wind. 80+ yards if you use the right spod."
71747,Victor,2007-05-15 06:26:00,1609,you just love slingshotting/spodding don't ya MJL  so... from ur previous experience ... does worms or gobies go further? ...
71748,Rich Clemens,2007-05-15 10:00:00,3131,"Good one MJL.  Just like we clean up the trash from around our fishing spots, we can also clean up the trash in the water.  Dispose of properly .... dead that is."
71791,michaelkovacs,2007-05-15 12:14:00,48,"I personally think disposing of them is the right thing, but needs to be done properly.  I like what the one post above said... a quick whack on the head, then into a bag.  It looks horrible to see someone doing needless things to these fish.  They are an invasive species, which should be killed, but no need for cruelty...do it fast then dispose of them...not leave them on the shore."
71809,OhioFisherman,2007-05-15 13:05:00,6623,"Here in Ohio it is illegal to use them for bait, or have them live in your posession like a livewell or bait bucket."
71845,Fishmaster,2007-05-15 14:27:00,920,Put them in the Garbage ....all gobies carry eggs so its better to make sure nothing eats them ..
71848,michaelkovacs,2007-05-15 14:37:00,48,I know it's illegal to use as bait in ontario as well... doesn't stop some people though!
71856,easton13th,2007-05-15 14:54:00,371,"Seagull dinner. But I never thought about the eggs, THANKS Fishmaster. It will be garbage for now on.!  Easton"
