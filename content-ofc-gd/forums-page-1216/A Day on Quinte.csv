Trolled for several hours, changing colours from time to time. Didn't see any action from the boats around us so headed back to shore.  While on shore another boat arrived that had gone 4/7 ranging from 4-9lbs. Their success came from using smaller body baits less deep than the Reef Runners. So we change it up and head back out back out again for another 4 hours. NADA once again.  Sometimes you win, sometimes the fish win! Nice day on the water anyway.  We'll have to give it another go later.  Cheers, Barnie"

70906,Mike the Pike,2007-05-12 23:12:00,3421, Quinte is hot right now in the spring you must do things differently.Last weekend I only managed a few but saw many anglers get their limit.  The key to succes in the spring is a very slow troll.Fish in 10 to 20 ft of water.The good old worm harness is the way to go in the spring.Crank baits are more successful in the fall in Quinte.  This is what you have to do use a floating worm harness double hook chartreuse or silver and black put a white Mr.Twister on the bottom hook or some gulp bait from Berkley .Attach all this to a one ounze bottom bouncer and just watch how it will out produce the crankbaits.Troll slowly  Better luck next time.MTP
71408,bbog,2007-05-14 16:37:00,665,Thanks for the tips MTP - I'll certainly give them a try if I get back to Quinte in the near future.
