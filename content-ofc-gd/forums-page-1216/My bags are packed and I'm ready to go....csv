71506,ccmtcanada,2007-05-14 19:23:00,7971,Have a great trip!  Always look forward to your reports....scenery and all....LOL
71627,Bernie,2007-05-14 23:42:00,3190,Well he made it as far as Powassan by noon today. Wayne and Leah stopped by for a quick visit at my shop. It was the first time meeting the good folks for me. We really didn't have a lot of time to chew the fat today as Wayne and Leah were anxious to get up to their great place at Temagami and I was shorthanded at my shop. Wayne will not have an excuse for not catching any fish because I know he has at least a handful of jigs to use. Good luck and enjoy yourself folks.

71154,irishfield,2007-05-13 20:09:00,26272,"...  Picked out a couple rods to get us by for 10 or so days.    Have everything here from the boat, as I cleaned it out before trading in, so more than usual to fit in the truck. Puzzle goin together in the box    and I made it all fit with room in the back seat of the cab for our food/plug in cooler and our clothes    Good thing the ford has a deeper box than a GMC !  Hope to have  a nice report in when I come back...probably just more scenery on the lake...but hell you're used to that by now!  :Gonefishing:  "
71155,Dondorfish,2007-05-13 20:40:00,1000,Enjoy your trip Wayne and we look forward to your report upon your return. Try and take a little time away from work to wet a line! Play safe   Don  
71159,irishfield,2007-05-13 20:55:00,26272,"The only work I have planned Don is putting the water intake line in, getting it primed and running and then rehooking my floater docks up to the crib dock. The rest of the time..play with new toy and FISH.  I know it won't go that way...but there's always hope!"
71162,ch312,2007-05-13 21:10:00,1590,"hmmm...i guess ""before"" reports are the new fad?"

71182,GbayGiant,2007-05-13 22:16:00,1780,I'm sure the wife will still have a daily check list of jobs to do under the magnet on the fridge every morning.  Try to get out in the morning before she wakes up and sneak out quietly.  Have a blast Wayne.

71246,irishfield,2007-05-14 01:27:00,26272,Thanks everyone and CH go kill a squirrel or something!  Have fun Phil....no shore lunches for ya when you get there and hopefully things don't change so that you can indeed get there. That Minnesota/Ontario fire is raging out of control. All the way up past Red Lake is also a total fire ban area. Check everything you can and Geary before heading out.
