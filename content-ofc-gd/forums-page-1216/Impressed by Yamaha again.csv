It was from Yamaha, after my spring purchase of the kicker motor they were sending me a survey to fill out. It asks about customer satisfaction with the product as well as the dealer and the explanation the dealer gave on delivery of the product. I received 2 of these from Yamaha on my main motor purchase last year. I know the dealer that I bought the kicker from and he explained that if there were any negative comments on the reply Yamaha investigated further to insure customer satisfaction. To me this seems like a great way to keep in touch with the customer and make sure your dealers are doing what they are supposed to do. Along with the survey they sent an embroidered Yamaha marine ball cap. A nice touch in my opinion. Probably most important is both products have worked very well and Yamaha has me as a repeat customer."
