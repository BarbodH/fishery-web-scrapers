I want to take my wife and 2 year old son for couple days camping over this coming long weekend. I'd like to fish Lake Simcoe and instead of traveling 2-3 times back and forth round trips it'll be nice to set up the tent and stay there, launch the boat, fish, relax etc. This way I could save on the gas cost. Called Sibbald Park...full...called few cabins/motels...everyone wants $100+/night. Is there not a crown land in the area I could just go and set up my tent for free? Doesn't have to be right on the lake...it's fine in the close proximity. Might be to naive but who knows...it's worth asking. Appreciate any and all ideas.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

72054,icefisherman,2007-05-16 00:14:00,952, Yes I just saw McRae P.P. has few open spots but they are too far from Jacksons Point/fishing action. It'll be quite a drive by car or by boat to get there daily. Hope to find something closer. Thanks.  Ice Fisherman
