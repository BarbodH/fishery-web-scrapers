Been lurking though and applaud everyone on their recent successes following the openers, keep it going!  Truly I haven't had much to report for the last while although I do promise to post a few pics when I get them from my friends.  I will be paddling the Serpentine lake loop this coming long weekend and I wonder if anyone can provide some insight on this route.  I'm not a ""hardcore"" paddler but I do love this stuff and I have never caoned this particular route (north Kawarthas).  If you've ever done this route, would you kindly fire me a reply with any tips or hints you could provide?  What I'm looking for is...  1.)  Recommended campsites 2.)  Where you rented your canoe 3.)  Best fishing lake on the route, tips, of course! 4.)  Any pitfalls to worry about?  Anyhow, would just appreciate it if someone would share their experience more than anything.  I have a plan in place but I always welcome feedback from someone in the know.  Many thanks in advance.  I promise pics - hopefully of BIG FISH!  Tight lines to all,  MOB"
