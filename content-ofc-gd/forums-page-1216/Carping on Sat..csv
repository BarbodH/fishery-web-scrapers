71394,Victor,2007-05-14 16:03:00,1609,"Got out with Wolfville and his family for a couple hours of carp fishing on saturday. We got there at around noon and only one fish was caught in the morning so i prepared myself for a ""skunking day"" lol.  Before i even got set up... Randy's alarm and baitrunner was screaming and here are the pics ...  seems like his sons are well trained  ... they're all ready to net it   i still remember wolfville's ""first post of 2007"" ... where there's a pic of Sullivan looking at the big fish photoz caught ... he was probably thinking ""dad isn't as pathetic anymore""   some nice color on this 17lber   here's the 2nd one of the day for Randy, a 15lb fish ...   just as i was thinking if i'm doing something wrong ... my alarm went and got this 15lber ... 3lbs bigger than my previous PB   big fish of the day ... and my new PB ... weighted in at 26lbs 5oz ... i couldn't be any happier   Throughout the entire day Shawn (wolfville's older son) did a great job helping the gobies population ... he must have gotten 25+ of them ... now he's named the ""Gobie King"" ... here's Sullivan with his brother's catch   all in all it was an amazing day ... finally christened my Nexave and my Baitrunner ... also got my new PB ... now this one is going to be hard to beat ..."
71404,Terry,2007-05-14 16:27:00,14456,some nice sized carp there  I never fish for them but they always give a real nice fight when I hook into one
71407,urbanangler1990,2007-05-14 16:33:00,933,"nice ones, wtg"
71416,ccmtcanada,2007-05-14 16:59:00,7971,WOO HOO!!! Great report and pics!  Congrats on your new PB too....I believe I predicted not too long ago that you'd start to catch the bigguns.  Great job Victor.
71422,jdmls,2007-05-14 17:15:00,575,nice report.....is that the mouth of the credit?
71423,jediangler,2007-05-14 17:25:00,1923,"Congrats on the PB, and it's good to see the kids working on the invasive species. Great report."
71426,wolfville,2007-05-14 17:36:00,396,"Thanks for putting together the report, Victor. Congratulations again for the PBs (twice in an outing).  Sean is so hooked on gobie fishing now, althought he did admit carp are a bit bigger than gobies ;-) And he is ready for CAG Invitentiaonal... at least now we know he won't be bored."
71439,Victor,2007-05-14 17:58:00,1609,Thanks everyone  cliff: can you please predict when i am going to catch my first 30? lol ... that number seems hard to break  wolfville: .. opps now i know it's sean not shawn haha ... i'm sure we're gonna be busy with unhooking fish and putting worms on the hook that day
71616,The Urban Fisherman,2007-05-14 23:07:00,2050,"Hey Victor,  I see you were fishing the mouth of the Credit - I fish that area quite often and might be able to show you some good carping spots if you live nearby!  Thanks for the report!  Cheers, UF"
71623,Jackel,2007-05-14 23:17:00,25,Way to go Victor   I remember fishing that same spot a few years ago with my dad and he pulled out a 37lb.  Congrats on your new PB.  Jackel
71641,tbayboy,2007-05-15 00:06:00,1497,"Congrats Victor, great job"
71648,Golfisher,2007-05-15 00:13:00,586,"Moving from a palmable carp to a 26 pounder in just a week... at this rate, you'll break the Ontario record before the end of the month.  WTG."
71651,Clampet,2007-05-15 00:14:00,1947,"Great Carp report, and the color in those Pictures sure do Spring justice!!"
71661,mattyk,2007-05-15 00:27:00,2110,very nice PB carp!
71685,007,2007-05-15 01:45:00,537,Congratulations on your PB carp Victor - Great report and some great big fish.  What was the bait of choice? Corn or boilies?  Cheers 007
71695,bpsbassman,2007-05-15 01:56:00,941,WOW!! beauty job Victor and great report.  Very impressive job shattering your PB!!
71723,Victor,2007-05-15 03:12:00,1609,thanks again everyone!  007: both fish were caught on maize ... it wouldn't be a good idea to use canned corn because of all the gobies in there
71731,MJL,2007-05-15 03:42:00,2427,Where are your textbooks?  You should be studying!  You need a girlfriend to put you back inline.  Great pics

71884,wolfville,2007-05-15 16:10:00,396," Yup, can't wait for CAGI.... Victor is my guest.  Vic, it's gonna be a while before you get invited to an invitational bass tourney, so let he bass opener go for once ;-)"
