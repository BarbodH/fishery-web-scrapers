71124,TennesseeGuy,2007-05-13 18:39:00,957,It's a good lake with plenty of walleyes and pike.  It's C & R except for a few to eat while in camp.
71317,Letpikego,2007-05-14 04:26:00,29,Have you been there?

You may want to introduce yourself as people 'round these parts are a little more friendly and helpful once we know a little about you.  If you do go up there be sure to post a report with pics, we love that here as well.  Welcome!"
71735,Letpikego,2007-05-15 04:05:00,29,I appreciate the welcomes.  My 12 year old son and I are going to Joyce Lake early July.  I hope to have lots of nice pics to post.
