There were lots of boats out, more boats fishing than I have seen our fish’n since I moved here last July.  Saturday afternoon my wife and I headed up to her parents farm. As, she and her parents sat and chatted I hoped in our little 4 x 4 and headed down the trail to their lake (basically a very large pond about 40 acres in size) I took 1 cast = nothing; 2nd cast = a pike hit, 3rd cast = pike on ( man was I glad I had a good leader and a baitcaster loaded with 50 lb test power pro there’s tons of stumps and logs.); 4th cast = nothing; 5th cast = nothing; 6th cast = nothing; 7th cast = another pike.  It’s at this point that I realize what a special little treasure they (and me too) have here, apparently a number of years ago and 2 owners ago someone had stocked pike in this big pond and they are doing ok. I released all 6 that I ended up catching; I’m hoping to make it up there again next week to catch them again.  Sunday afternoon my wife and I headed out on Scugog and to her pleasure she was the only one that caught a walleye. Me, somehow, snagged a carp, but after 1min. The scales came off.  I saw some guys fishing at an access down the road from my place. Between the two of them they had about 6 walleye, all of which were very small ( 3 were the size of perch). Looks like the best fishing is to be had right off shore.  How’d you make out?  Entropy"

Saw some big carp swimming around.  Problem is for us, we have no idea where to go....tried some spots on the map...I guess it's just gettin out there and trying."
