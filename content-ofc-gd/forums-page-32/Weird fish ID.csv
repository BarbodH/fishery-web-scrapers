1058448,Freshtrax,2020-03-31 14:59:00,2215,Anyone I'd the weird little fish.   Some thing killed it and dropped it near my buddy's farm pond.   About 4 inches long.   Got a weird tail on it  
1058457,chris.brock,2020-03-31 16:31:00,4053,"central mud minnow would be my guess, a native species"
1058461,OhioFisherman,2020-03-31 17:00:00,6623,http://wildlife.ohiodnr.gov/species-and-habitats/species-guide-index/fish/central-mudminnow I am guessing Chris is right.
1058471,Freshtrax,2020-03-31 17:42:00,2215,Thanks chris .  That's it for sure.
1058478,kickingfrog,2020-03-31 19:29:00,8333,It'd be nice to see the true shape of the tail. I was thinking a small snakehead but wouldn't put any money down.
1058479,Canuck,2020-03-31 19:44:00,491,Looks to me like a baby bowfin.
1058488,Jon,2020-03-31 22:22:00,209,Central Mudminnow for sure. Hopefully the link works. Ontario Freshwater Fishes Database - Central Mudminnow.  Jon

1058544,Freshtrax,2020-04-01 14:56:00,2215,Yea this is a small farm pond not verry big.
1058769,Chuck Enwinde,2020-04-03 10:57:00,247,First time I saw one in my bait bucket I chucked it in the bush for fear of unleashing a baby bowfin on a little brookie lake.
