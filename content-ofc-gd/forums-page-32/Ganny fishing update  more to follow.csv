1059372,chessy,2020-04-09 22:07:00,610,"Request for Provincial Order to postpone or cancel opening of spring fishing seasonÂ  	CouncilÂ passed a ResolutionÂ to request that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry issue the necessary regulation or order, and enact the legislation required to postpone or cancel the opening of the trout fishing season on the Ganaraska River in an effort to limit the potential for crowds and gatherings to form. Council requested that this Resolution be forwarded to Premier Doug Ford, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry John Yakabuski, MPP David Piccini and area municipalities. Camping during trout fishing seasonÂ  	CouncilÂ amended By-law 54/2017, being a By-law that permits an exemption to camping restrictions for the Cavan Street Park and Optimist Park during the opening season of trout fishing. The amended By-law will not permit camping in these parks throughout the duration of the declared Provincial emergency, in an effort to reduce group gatherings of more than five people."
