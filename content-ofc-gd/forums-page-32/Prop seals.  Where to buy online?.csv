My son is a marine engine mechanic and might be able to get them for you, they have been designated an essential service because they service OPP and MNR equipment so he is working on a call in basis."
1059471,super dave,2020-04-11 01:28:00,323,Hey BC. That's great. How can I get a hold of your son?
1059472,super dave,2020-04-11 01:29:00,323,Thanks OF.    I'll take a look at the link.   Watch a lot of danger marine vids too.
1059484,Big Cliff,2020-04-11 10:11:00,6899,"Send me the make modle and serial # of your motor, I will have him check and see if they have them in stock or can get them."

They can get you anything marine related and will sent it to you. I have dealt with them for years and trust them and find their prices are very fair. It's good to know I am talking to a human being that I know and trust rather than fill out an order online from who knows where. Why buy online? I always deal with a bricks and mortar as locally as I can get than some obscure website. Yea I know, call me old fashioned. I like to support my neighbours, yea I'm old(er)."
