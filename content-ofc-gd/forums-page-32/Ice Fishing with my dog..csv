I used to take my dog fishing lots more than I do now, even though he makes it quite clear when I am heading out that he wants to go. Unfortunately for him he suffers from the same thing I do, my brain still behaves like a 17 year old, but my body doesn't, and he will injure himself in pursuit of what he loves. With less snow, warmer temps and the need to drive to access lakes I can normally get to by sled, taking the pup with me becomes more feasible. I just wish he could hunt as well as he fishes, lol, its a complete @#$% show taking him grouse hunting.  "

1058748,Bill,2020-04-02 22:58:00,140,Your dog sure gets excited when you catch a fish.
1058762,limeyangler,2020-04-03 03:10:00,5204,"Lol, trying to hatch a dead grouse....lol. He sure does. Because I’m always videoing when fishing, he now knows that when he hears the 3 beeps of my GoPro starting to record I probably have a fish on and comes running over...so smart!"

My dog LOVES fish.  We were out in cold weather and caught a fish let it go.. Doesn't the fool stick his head down the hole up to the ears chasing it. Then runs out into the cold.  Wet long fur cold.. His mouth fur froze shut together then panics. Once in back in the hut, all was good but will forever laugh at it.. My dog too old for ice fishing now but in his mind he wants to still come"
1058838,limeyangler,2020-04-03 20:26:00,5204,"Yeah, Roloff used to accompany me more often,  he loves chasing the snow machine but just can’t keep up anymore, First ice and spring was usually our ice time anyway, way too cold for him to be out for hours the rest of winter here, especially on the ice, his pads get tore up pretty bad even when it’s mild, and he would be a nightmare to have in the Otter pop up."
