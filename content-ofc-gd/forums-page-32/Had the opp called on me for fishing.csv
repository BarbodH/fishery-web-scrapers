1059718,pics,2020-04-14 01:34:00,1268,I have a lot of friends that think it's all a big conspiracy.¬† In the future it will be clearer what steps worked and what didn't and which countries messed it up. What we should take from this is we can't expect other countries to bail us out in crisis.¬† Made in Canada really does matter...
1059719,chris.brock,2020-04-14 01:59:00,4053,"Yes, made in Canada really does matter, in this crisis, and also when there is no crisis and everything's normal, being able to produce stuff and being a seller is the way to prosperity, not being a constant buyer of chinese crap what I have taken from this- the people we have elected and the people they use for guidance are terribly incompetent "

1059444,CRAPPIE,2020-04-10 17:10:00,213,Good news for some anglers
1059445,CRAPPIE,2020-04-10 17:11:00,213,Good news for some boaters to launch their boats
1059451,misfish,2020-04-10 18:02:00,29133,Barrie launches were added yesterday . Barrie‚Äôs marinas and boat launch will be closed to the public until further notice as required by Ontario‚Äòs emergency order amid the coronavirus pandemic.
1059453,irishfield,2020-04-10 18:43:00,26272,"Penetang's wharf, park and boat launch are closed.. mind you the bay is still full of ice..."
1059467,chris.brock,2020-04-11 00:11:00,4053,"there was caution tape and signage around he ignored, the cops were hiding and popped out and yelled for him to come over, he was close to his house and jogging by himself"
1059483,lew,2020-04-11 09:59:00,12766,"OK thanks Chris, I spose if he ignored the signs there's not much he can do about it."
1059485,Garnet,2020-04-11 11:01:00,2056,If I got a charge like this I would be fighting. The courts will be clogged and most will likely be dropped. Sorry don't pay taxes for nothing.
1059513,limeyangler,2020-04-11 17:34:00,5204,"It‚Äôs about managing densely populated areas, zone 17 includes most of the population of Ontario, whereas as in Zone 1 its only Moosebunk and his family, a¬†few beavers and an elk."
1059516,ecmilley,2020-04-11 17:52:00,2163,Due to resident complaints at a private launch the opp visited and convinced the owner to gate the launch so no one can access the lake. Guess this means I'll be breaking the law lol. 2 man operation can have the ranger off the trailer on 30 seconds and drive truck back to house
1059526,Old Ironmaker,2020-04-11 20:48:00,8243,"Like living to a ripe old age? Sumptin' like that Beans? That's what I'm looking forward to Cliff, and if it means not taking the boat out well that's what I am going to do, look forward to living longer and doing my absolute best to ensure I am not the one that passes on this thing to people I love and care about, simple as that I am going to tell you all what I say to everyone I know that goes for a ride to get out of the house because they all say they aren't in contact with another soul and not harming anyone. The idea is that if for any reason 1st responders need to be called out resources are squandered. Vehicles should be on the roads for 2 reasons. 1, to get to and from work if you are considered to be essential. 2, to get to and from grocery stores,¬† pharmacies and getting fuel to get to and back from an essential job. I think that is pretty simple. I won't delve into the discussion as to whom and what should or shouldn't be essential. I will say this though, our 1st responders are the most essential people we have right now. Please just stay home. It's tough, it's boring, it's terrible but it's better than being dead. I don't know how hard that is to understand. In my humble opinion and that of the leaders we elected to make the tough decisions for us just stay home. Nice fish but please just stay home."

1059612,big guy,2020-04-12 23:21:00,414,"Partly, but also partly that the virus is not as dangerous as what we are being led to believe. How much of this is being done to take away our individual rights and freedoms? To drive an agenda."

1059624,BillM,2020-04-13 03:55:00,17367,An agenda for who exactly?
1059277,ecmilley,2020-04-09 03:39:00,2163,So out doing some crappie fishing today. Few boats out there guess the people in the canals and back bays been calling g the opp for fishing . As it turns out they can't stop me but with the Kawartha lakes closing the parks and all municipal launches and you decide to park there they will tow your vehicle and trailer be warned friends. 
1059281,Big Cliff,2020-04-09 08:58:00,6899,"Nice fish, hope you didn't get towed."
1059327,mamona,2020-04-09 14:38:00,597,"I should stop reading this forum, it makes harder staying home. Nice fish!"
1059359,ecmilley,2020-04-09 19:33:00,2163,Nope was on private property. All is good there. But finding it odd people calling the cops everywhere about fishing and the opp showing up . Seen someone deciding a private launch was off limits and made a sign of closed ramp lol. This pandemic bringing the pettiness and racism out fairly good
1059377,Big Cliff,2020-04-09 22:23:00,6899,"I just heard today that they may close zone 17 this spring, they are worried too many people will go fishing and they haven't got the staff to police all the access points."
1059382,porkpie,2020-04-09 22:35:00,2521,At least you got out fishing!
1059390,big guy,2020-04-10 00:11:00,414,"this is gutting me, i had so much confidence going into this spring"
1059395,chris.brock,2020-04-10 00:33:00,4053,"Nice slab! And yeah, the cops have been instructed to enforce. My uncle got a $750 ticket today for jogging by himself through a park by his house."
1059399,DanD,2020-04-10 01:09:00,2223,"Ok. I'm a bit of a history buff and hearing the stories my dad has told me; about the¬†occupation of Belgium; during WW2.¬† This pandemic sounds very familiar. Where people for minimal reasons call officials on their neighbors. Sad that people think that they're¬†doing the right thing by calling¬†the ""officials""¬† for/on people for things that are not harming anyone. I think these type of things are going to continue; until were afraid to do anything without being prosecuted??? Dan. "
1059401,Fisherman,2020-04-10 01:32:00,7201,That's going a little too far if he was by himself.¬† Next time tell him to carry a bag of donuts.
1059403,Weeds,2020-04-10 01:57:00,782,"How can you close just one zone? I can‚Äôt imagine they have enough staff to police all the access points in any zone. Although I can see it happening, I did after all just shell out close to 200 bucks for a three year sport and small game card. ¬†With a little luck they‚Äôll cancel hunting in the fall too."
1059406,chris.brock,2020-04-10 02:17:00,4053,"I think their intentions are good, they are listening to their medical experts and saying STAY HOME!, but as politicians they are inherently dumb and now they are over thinking, a bad combination"
1059411,Garnet,2020-04-10 12:06:00,2056,The courts are going to be clogged these types of fines.
1059413,lew,2020-04-10 12:28:00,12766,"What exactly did he get the ticket for, from what I understand it's still legal to be in a park unless signed otherwise and your not using any park equipment including benches. Seems really strange he'd get a ticket for simply being in a legal place."
1059415,Terry,2020-04-10 12:29:00,14456,If the park was posted covid19 closed and he was in it it‚Äôs a fine

1059420,grimsbylander,2020-04-10 13:45:00,3016,As I understand it Lew the park lands are completely closed and in fact most are taped off and have signage indicating it. I saw a couple walking their dog through a waterfront park here in Grimsby and even I thought it was strange. They must have ducked under the caution taped to get in.
1059421,grimsbylander,2020-04-10 13:49:00,3016,"Wow $750 is pretty damn steep!!! Looking back over history, if he would have snuck in to the park and been poaching trout during the off season using dynamite, it would have been $100."
1059422,lew,2020-04-10 13:58:00,12766,"If you go down a couple paragraphs it specifically says ""green spaces such as parks"" will remain open, but perhaps that's also been changed since this was written. https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ontario-closes-all-playgrounds-sports-facilities-and-off-leash-dog-parks-1.4875261"
1059425,grimsbylander,2020-04-10 14:06:00,3016,Yes it‚Äôs right in there! It seems every municipality has their own spin on how to manage it.
1059426,Terry,2020-04-10 14:08:00,14456,Yup some municipalities are reopening boat ramps with strict rules on distancing
1059430,CRAPPIE,2020-04-10 15:04:00,213,Where is it?
1059431,lew,2020-04-10 15:14:00,12766,"I'm no lawyer but if the Premiers words are written in plain English saying parks will remain open, but some municipalities put their own spin on it and fine someone $750 for doing what the boss says is OK, there shouldn't be any problem beating it in court. And for $750 it's sure be worthwhile fighting it."
1059432,Terry,2020-04-10 15:30:00,14456,People that are being fine are going in posted areas ¬†and from what I read the sign¬†states ¬†covid-19 ¬†and they are being fined under health board regulations
