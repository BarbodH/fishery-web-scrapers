We also know that many of you have questions related to the impact this situation may have on your spring outdoors pursuits. With all of the rumours and speculation, the OFAH is pushing for answers from the government.""

1059545,MJIG,2020-04-11 23:02:00,227,"Here’s the statement from the province: https://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2020/04/ontario-takes-further-action-to-stop-the-spread-of-covid-19.html A direct quote from the above link: “Prohibiting recreational camping on Crown land as of April 9, 2020.

It's a form of a travel ban. If we don't get it we will be forced to follow what other countries are doing like Italy. Curfews."
