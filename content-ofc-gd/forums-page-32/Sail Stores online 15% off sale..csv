1057731,captpierre,2020-03-22 16:31:00,2521,Ends tonightÂ I think.
1058449,AKRISONER,2020-03-31 15:18:00,5558,"20% off this morning free shipping over $50.  Couldnt resist...grabbed the last of a couple of good colour yamasenkos for $8 a pack. Megabass stuff has been ravaged but i managed to get a sonic side for less than $20 thats basically 40% off tacklewarehouse price. Bought some keitechs and a couple of reel covers! with our dollar being so low, its actually a crazy good deal on the high end stuff.  Their stores are all closed so they are obviously trying to flood as much cash flow via online sales as they possibly can to keep the business floating"
1058452,grimsbylander,2020-03-31 16:12:00,3016,I hate hearing about sales like this...I have so much stuff now I canâ€™t justify buying more...but I wanna!!!
1058453,AKRISONER,2020-03-31 16:17:00,5558,the one thing that probably saved me is that their website isnt that great for managing stock levels or selecting colours. They dont provide the proper names for anything's colours so it can be difficult to get exactly what you want. It took me cycling through their senko colours and attempting to order various amounts before i would hit the sweet spot and find things that actually would go into my cart because they were in stock lol.  if they were anything like tacklewarehouse I would have spent far more lol.
1058454,misfish,2020-03-31 16:18:00,29133,"Heard Cabelas will be going on line sales, but you can pick up outside at the store ."
1058458,captpierre,2020-03-31 16:35:00,2521,Buy something. Its therapeutic. Â We need it these day
1058459,misfish,2020-03-31 16:42:00,29133,"Sails site is so funky . Also ,all their fly tying stuff is in store only . No online sales ."
1058462,mamona,2020-03-31 17:03:00,597,"Yeah, most items I am interested in are in store only or not on sale. 	Plus you pay for shipping."
1058463,AKRISONER,2020-03-31 17:12:00,5558,free shipping over $49 lord knows i blow past that barrier in seconds lol
1058464,mamona,2020-03-31 17:13:00,597,"Hahaha, I wish you did not tell me that!"
1058474,porkpie,2020-03-31 18:56:00,2521,Iâ€™m with you. Â The only thing I need is more storage room!
1058560,Tjames09,2020-04-01 16:40:00,664,"Looks like all the megabass stuff is ""in store only"" which makes no senses the stores are closed lol."
1058590,AKRISONER,2020-04-01 19:07:00,5558,"wouldnt have mattered buddy, if it wasnt I would have bought it all outÂ ðŸ˜†"
