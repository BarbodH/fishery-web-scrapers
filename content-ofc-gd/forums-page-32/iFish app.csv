1058436,Tjames09,2020-03-31 12:17:00,664,Im not a big fan of sharing fishing spots. It makes the learning curve zero and floods spots with boats. People post a picture of a musky and then Where they caught it. That post stays online forever so now anyone can look that up and everyone will fish that spot.
1058445,Musky Plug,2020-03-31 13:49:00,398,This is the reason I seldom post fishing pictures online.If I do I blur or alter the background or make the person turn to open water so it’s harder to recognize. We put a lot of time and effort into finding those spots and it could take no time for them to be blown up.
