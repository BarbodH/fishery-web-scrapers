1059149,grimsbylander,2020-04-07 13:32:00,3016,"If by lines you mean the taped off areas and the signs indicating the parks are closed, I’m going go with - of course not."
1059151,Terry,2020-04-07 14:05:00,14456,It seems if you can find a place to access the water that isn’t taped off and isn’t park land then you are not breaking any laws at the moment but things are changing by the second
1059152,antonio77,2020-04-07 14:07:00,32,looks like all along Niagara everything is tapped and with signs saying - closed.
