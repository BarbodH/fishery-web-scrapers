1059324,KraTToR,2020-04-09 14:34:00,506,"I may be taking a contract position at Bruce Nuclear this spring and other than the Salmonoid fishing in Lake Huron I'm wondering about the area just north of South Hampton.  The area along the west side of the Niagara Peninsula has an abundance of structure (Shoals, islands, etc) so I'm thinking this should be a hotspot for Bass, Pike, and maybe even walleye.  Similar to Georgian Bay but on a much smaller scale. Any thoughts/experience to share? TIA.  P."

1059468,AmblinRamblin3,2020-04-11 00:31:00,11,are you sure you don't mean the bruce peninsula?
1059473,jjcanoe,2020-04-11 02:01:00,744,"Yes quite similar in structure but not as many islands, there are lots of bass near shore and on good days you can almost sight fish them. Walleye not so sure and as for pike I've heard stories about good pike fishing in the area but they might be stories, or maybe not?  Try and find some drop offs rocky shoals or flats or river mouths"
