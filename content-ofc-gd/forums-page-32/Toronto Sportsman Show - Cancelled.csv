1057231,SmokestackLightnin,2020-03-13 14:16:00,390,"Effective immediately, the 2020 Toronto Sportsmen's Show (March 18-22), which was set to take place at The International Centre in Mississauga, will not be opening. In the 73-year history of the Toronto Sportsmen's Show, this is the first time it has had to suspend the event. This action is being taken based on the recommendations made by the provincial Chief Medical Officer of Health and Peel Public Health to help reduce possible risk regarding the spread of COVID-19 (Coronavirus). Attendees who have already purchased tickets will be notified by email. TSS staff will contact exhibitors as soon as possible with more information."

1057240,HTHM,2020-03-13 16:11:00,4082,I'm wondering if Hamilton Bassmasters swap meet will be cancelled as well? Might be in everyone's best interest if it is.
1057241,Fisherman,2020-03-13 16:23:00,7201,"It might be a bummer, but do you really want to take a chance."
1057242,misfish,2020-03-13 17:04:00,29133,"They have closed the schools for 3 weeks. I feel for those parents that have to stay home from work or shell out money for day care and cannot afford to pay or lose their wages due to staying home . Many live pay cheque to pay cheque..Â Â  I am staying away from groups and even have gone as far as wearing gloves when using a key pad for when I pay by debit. Everything gets wipes down with cleaner here that we both touch. Faucet,door handles what ever we come in contact daily.Â  Not sure if I am over reacting,but I don't feel like getting sick for this 2 week lock down they have in place .  I have not read anywhere where it says if you get this virus, stay quarantined for the 14 days and get cleared, that you cannot catch it again."
1057243,chris.brock,2020-03-13 17:29:00,4053,"everything is cancelled, including MY WORK! WHOAAA! in seriousness, I hope everyone stays well and we weather this storm"
1057245,Headhunter,2020-03-13 17:51:00,5703,"What I have heard Brian is that people who get it, beat it and feel well enough to go back to work can still be shedding the virus... and they don't know how long that will continue. HH"
1057247,Tjames09,2020-03-13 17:54:00,664,I figured that was going to happen.
1057255,Fisherman,2020-03-13 20:13:00,7201,"Apparently a few have gotten ill a second time.Â  If you can make it past the land mines, gun emplacements and auto phazers you have a chance to visit me, lol.Â Â  Stay away from crowds of more than 1. Did a quick run of staple groceries, holy cow, shelves are emptying fast, oatmeal, flour, sugar, canned milk hard to find."
1057256,misfish,2020-03-13 20:30:00,29133,"Got a freezer full of stuff to cook up. Was atÂ  Brants factory and Starskys this morning. Loaded up . Going to make a mash potato,herring and beet salad this weekend."
1057257,Old Ironmaker,2020-03-13 20:46:00,8243,"This is a historic time in our modern society. Most of us are boomers or of later generations. The last time in history that society has been effected this much would be WW2 in my estimation. Cancelling any function where large numbers are involved is prudent. My God Daughter's wedding is coming up in mid April. 300 invited, what to do?"
1057263,Fisherman,2020-03-13 21:56:00,7201,"Occasions like that only happen once,Â  I would look at the good and the bad side of things and weigh the pro's and con's.Â  Maybe the bug will minimize by then, who knows.Â  Personally I would opt out and hope they understand that the elder population is much more vulnerable than the young ones."
1057278,Old Ironmaker,2020-03-14 03:14:00,8243,"My thinking exactly Fisherman, postpone for now. Even if the risk of a large gathering has diminished by the time her day has arrived the couple will need to make a decision ASAP. Not something one can postpone a week before the event without huge ramifications and associated costs for both the couple, the Family and guests.Â  Her Father told me today that she is devastated. In the scheme of all things it's easy for someone to tell her that her nuptials are not as important as the Health and Safety of her loved ones that are to attend. But try telling that to a 24 year old bride to be. We will be visiting them this Sunday."

Was hoping to get my hands on a few new baits that I don't have. More than likely now all of the bait makers are going to raffle off their baits online, which I think is stupid."
1057320,captpierre,2020-03-14 19:20:00,2521,Peterborough fishing show/swap postponed to May 31. Cottage Life Show cancelled. ðŸ˜³

1057330,pics,2020-03-15 00:47:00,1268,Although they may have a refund of their vendor fees I'm sure a lot of exhibitors already put out money beforehand.Â  It was already hard for retailers there to recoup their costs and all the extra stock they're now stuck with they're going to have to sell off somehow..
