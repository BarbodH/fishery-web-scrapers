Found this kids craft tube stuff . Figured I would see if it would work . It is a bit on the stiff side, but I found by pulling it through your fingers, creating heat friction, it softened up and stretched nice and worked great for soft tube or ribbing . Now if I could find it in different colors .      Still working on my stone fly tie . Getting there . Need to be more  patient .😠   "
