1058825,Bill,2020-04-03 17:51:00,140,https://ckxsfm.com/local-boat-ramps-and-launches-remain-open-for-now/  I do not agree with this. Thought I would share it though.
1058846,porkpie,2020-04-03 22:17:00,2521,"I would Un share it.  A number of the small unknown launches I frequent are still open.  I’ll be darned if I’m going to post all these spots for people to flock to.  Mums the word in all instances.  But, I absolutely applaud Chatham- Kent for their stance.  If every dummy and his brother can flock to his nature trail while he’s on mandated holiday, why can’t I go fishing alone in my boat on my days off."
1058851,grimsbylander,2020-04-03 22:28:00,3016,Yes. Everyone should have the right to be equally irresponsible.
1058855,Terry,2020-04-03 23:08:00,14456,I agree. And huge fines for morons who don’t keep their distance
1058876,porkpie,2020-04-04 03:43:00,2521,The ticket is pretty steep Terry.  $880 with court costs.
1058878,Big Cliff,2020-04-04 11:05:00,6899,"It's a gamble, $880.00 if you get caught. If you get Covid 19 it could be your or someone else's life. I'm not that much of a gambler."
1058880,Terry,2020-04-04 11:30:00,14456,Well I sure would not try to launch at a closed ramp with a fixed income that would really hurt
