1058960,KraTToR,2020-04-04 23:09:00,506,My nephew from Calgary wants to come this way for his 50th this year some time.  He's never fished for Bass or Muskie. Depending on when he can make it (Covid not withstanding) I want to take him to longpoint and to the area outside of wood's bay for bass and the Kawartha's for ski's if its that late in the year.  That should bust his noodle.. yes/no???
