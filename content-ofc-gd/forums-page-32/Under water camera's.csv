1057055,Fisherman,2020-03-08 15:23:00,7201,"From reading on other sites, a lot of satisfied people."
1057057,misfish,2020-03-08 17:59:00,29133,Your doing alright winning some nice prizes . I will have a camera next year. Or sooner. If they go on sale .
1057059,GBW,2020-03-08 20:18:00,8460,Thanks Mr B.  I will be honest I have spent a few bucks trying for items but YES I am still ahead of the game cost wise.
1057060,irishfield,2020-03-08 20:38:00,26272,I have no want for the extra piss off of knowing they are actually down there and not biting!!
1057061,gino,2020-03-08 20:57:00,400,"My buddy, has one. Works great, he used it on Simcoe and was awesome in seeing how whitefish bite. I would say it's a game changer. You will enjoy it. 👍"
1057063,misfish,2020-03-08 21:49:00,29133,"I want to know the bottom structure . Sand,mussels and what the hell the clouds of fish are."
1057066,akaShag,2020-03-09 00:08:00,2073,scary photo on the monitor.................😉 Doug
1057068,BillM,2020-03-09 00:30:00,17367,How many feet of cord attached to the camera? 
1057069,porkpie,2020-03-09 01:01:00,2521,It’s awesome for checking the bottom structure.  We used them all winter to see if we where sitting on rock and to see if it was holding gobies.  Worked great!!
1057070,GBW,2020-03-09 01:32:00,8460,This one is 100 feet Shag (aka Doug) no it isn't
1057528,Canuck,2020-03-19 10:33:00,491,MY son got me the same camera for Xmas.  I have not tried it yet in the water.  Looks decent.
1057561,BillM,2020-03-19 19:59:00,17367,I'd love one for fishing deep lakers.   I'd probably be on the camera more then fishing though...
1057565,misfish,2020-03-19 20:19:00,29133,That is my big fear Bill. LOL
1057593,GBW,2020-03-20 01:12:00,8460,Well with my luck and the way the world and weather is going I wont get to test this unit out till the boating season.  But I thank you all that have replied.
1057602,J Roelofsen,2020-03-20 07:25:00,84,"They're ok for Lakers if your consistently pulling them off bottom......until you hook one and it wraps the cable 1/2dz times 😄 Ask how I know lol....Better left for smaller, bottom oriented fish and verifying bottom composition IMO Josh "
1058350,Bill,2020-03-30 00:29:00,140,I have one but don't use it a lot. I trust my Raymarine to show me fish and structure. I use it when the fish are off bite and I am bored.
