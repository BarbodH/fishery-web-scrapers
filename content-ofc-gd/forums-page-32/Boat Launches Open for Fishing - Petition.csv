1059302,RPW,2020-04-09 13:10:00,24,An interesting read... https://www.thecollegefix.com/epidemiologist-coronavirus-could-be-exterminated-if-lockdowns-were-lifted/?fbclid=IwAR20QdNDfblDXR017NCSNQfpxtqDhoafElFOYXxYRhDD_AH0SfIoqFJ3YS8
1059306,lew,2020-04-09 13:22:00,12766,I see from your petition at the bottom of your page that you still think because your a fisherman your more important than pleasure boaters....so sad.
1059313,RPW,2020-04-09 13:46:00,24,"You cannot modify a petition after it is started, and I have little faith that it will make much difference anyways - therefore I am not starting a new one just to include pleasure boating. Thanks for your valued insight though."
1059314,BillM,2020-04-09 13:54:00,17367,Ramps being shutdown left and right.  Not much to do now
1059315,lew,2020-04-09 13:59:00,12766,"Nothing to do with valued insight, I just have no use for folks who think they're more important than others."
1059317,RPW,2020-04-09 14:14:00,24,"Well thanks for the information. Not that it really matters, at all. But I drive a bow rider, and use it mostly for pleasure boating - and occasionally fishing. I often enjoy taking the wife out for a ride in the evening booting across the lake without fishing at all, and even more enjoy going out with our friends and sitting at the local sandbar with the radio going and swimming. So do I think I am better than pleasure boaters? No, I am one. I believed by chances of getting ramps re-opened for fishing purposes to be greater than pleasure boating - and that is why I chose that route."
1059318,grimsbylander,2020-04-09 14:28:00,3016,"According to the signature count, in over one week there has been less than 300 people think it's a good idea; there is a message here. This thread alone has had 7500 views. You do realize it would take a WELL into 6 figures, probably 7, before anyone would even read it?? More and more ramps are being shut down every week and you're going to start another petition? lol I've seen petitions on this petition.org before and unfortunately, 99% of the time it's nothing more than a vehicle for people that want to push their own agendas. Last month there was a woman who wanted her son's 8 year old's hockey team to be able to continue playing because ""they really worked hard and were probably going to win"". God help us combat Covid-19 and stupidity. "
1059319,SirCranksalot,2020-04-09 14:30:00,3291,It is quite obvious that this petition is going nowhere and for that I am thankful!

1059323,LefroyFisherman,2020-04-09 14:34:00,602,"I’ve quite enjoyed thinking and listening about both sides of this. It’s a nice thought but I think the best thing to do is shut them down, not even people would follow the rules."
1059325,RPW,2020-04-09 14:36:00,24,This is the article I am talking about at the moment. Nothing about the boat ramps.
1059326,SirCranksalot,2020-04-09 14:36:00,3291,and so richly deserved
1059328,RPW,2020-04-09 14:42:00,24,"Wow you guys are all pretty short sighted eh. The last 10 posts were completely irrelevant to the post I made. Fun group we have here, enjoyed the intellectual conversation, guys."

People could be shore fishermen, or not a fisherman at all, just showing an interest in the topic. Its impossible to know why people view certain topics. As for the comments on this page, its no wonder threads get locked, why cant people discuss things rationally? Like the old saying, if you dont have anything good to say..."
1059347,Big Cliff,2020-04-09 16:52:00,6899,Exactly!
1059348,SirCranksalot,2020-04-09 17:00:00,3291,I think it started odd quite polite but turned nasty after the OP persisted.

1059066,big guy,2020-04-06 13:37:00,414,"Was talking about this very thing with a buddy yesterday. What will the fishing be like next year, or whenever we get to fish again, if we aren't going to be allowed to be on the the water for a while. It will be interesting for sure."
1059070,SmokestackLightnin,2020-04-06 14:22:00,390,"The same day that Ornge airlifted a 37 year old man from Pembroke to Ottawa hospital, Ornge released this statement: https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/air-ambulance-service-urges-ontarians-to-stay-home-as-it-transports-injured-in-atv-crashes/ Ornge, the province’s air ambulance service, is warning people to listen to public health officials and “stay home unless absolutely necessary” as it reports that crews across Ontario are beginning to transport patients injured in ATV crashes to hospital. There were 3 atvs at this scene.  The one driver was taken by ambulance then flown to Ottawa.  Second driver was charged with more than 80 mg per 100 ml of blood and the third driver registered a ""warn"" on the screen device. The point is not about drinking and riding,  which is not right, the point is  how many emergency people were involved with this one altercation. Every single medical officer of health, be it federal, provincial or municipal are asking people to stay home, isolate, and only go out if it is absolutely necessary."
1059071,Terry,2020-04-06 14:23:00,14456,Well on Simcoe if the weather is good for the spawn. There will be an extra 20 million perch fry (babies)  and 1 million extra crappie fry to try to grow up
1059072,SmokestackLightnin,2020-04-06 14:25:00,390,"You likely see stronger breeding classes in the years to come with minimal fishing pressure this spring.  Think of the breeding walleye that put the feedbag on after the spawn, with little to no angling pressure right after the spawn it could mean that there will be more breeding fish in the years to come.   I doubt that the fry from this year's spawn will be any different then normal but there will be more spawning fish from this around to spawn again."
1059077,LostAnotherOne,2020-04-06 17:22:00,956,Quick question guys.  Can the cops give you a ticket if you are hauling a boat to a private launch?  It would be pretty hard to miss.
1059078,Fisherman,2020-04-06 17:28:00,7201,Are you supposed to be traveling?
1059080,LostAnotherOne,2020-04-06 17:31:00,956,Just a question.  Wasn't planning on heading out.
1059084,porkpie,2020-04-06 17:42:00,2521,No they can’t because there is no travel restriction in place in Ontario.  I hauled my boat to a private launch this morning. People are making up rules here.  Go to the province of Ontario website or the OPP website if you want accurate information.  It’s far superior than internet rumours and manufactured laws.
1059085,grimsbylander,2020-04-06 17:57:00,3016,"I don't understand how people are making the leap from public boat ramps being closed to no fishing or boating allowed. There are two separate entities in play here...the new laws regarding temporary closures of public ramps and the moral issue of staying home. I personally have seen nothing that indicates you must stay indoors at all times. IF you can access your favorite lake without utilizing a public ramp, and IF you will not require stops for fuel, etc., and IF the risk(however large or small) that your well thought out plans will not require close human contact...have at it. Like many of you I have a boat in the driveway that is fueled up and ready to go. I also know which ramps are still open and give me access to the lake. But for now, I have decided to make the sacrifice(and I feel silly even typing that word) to not go. That's just between me and my conscience and has zero to do with anyone else. Maybe in a week or two I'll be out if things change. If people want to go and to them the risk is less than the reward, have a good time. But, last week when I see guys with their boats on the back at gas stations and Canadian Tire, I call Bull. All in my IMHO only."
1059099,fish4me,2020-04-06 20:25:00,59,"I can’t trust anglers from picking up their own garbage so I certainly am not going to  trust them that all will comply with social distancing.   Fishing is a recreation for most of us, it is certainly not essential.  Dave Chong said no fish is worth dying for during an ice fishing seminar and I agree but it applies in all situations.  Once you get or give the virus, there are no ‘do overs’, no take me backs.   I’m smart enough to know when I don’t know what I don’t know. There’s so much to this we and the medical community does not know yet.  Health care and front line workers are dying trying to save people.  If you don’t have your health, you have nothing, at the very least maintain what health you have.  The arguement to compare fishing to other activities that are essential is ignorant during a pandemic.  Stay at home and self isolate as much as you can, it is the most effective way to avoid infection."

1059163,porkpie,2020-04-07 16:32:00,2521,"You know what, your right.  All fishing is closed, it’s illegal to go outside your home.  The fine for being in a boat or on a riverbank is 1 miiiiillllion dollars!!!!  Zeeee Geshtappo vill arrest you for unlawful travel!  There that ought to do it, it’ll be a lot quieter on the water for the rest of us now!"
1059171,Rattletrap2,2020-04-07 17:19:00,1652,"I am still reading all the posts, but in case this point does not come up, I would like to throw this out there. I would love to be fishing as much as anyone. Have you given thought to this: There is way more to this than just ""social distancing""! By encouraging you to STAY HOME, there is less chance that you will run into an accident or something that will force medical and other first responders to have to tend to you. The more of us that are out on the roads, the percentage of likely hood of this happening. These first responders  and hospitals are already maxed out. I know you can stay a distance from each other at the ramp and in the boat, but it is bigger than all of that. Just Stay Home!"
1059178,big guy,2020-04-07 19:21:00,414,"Actually, unless things have changed in the last few days, a lot of hospitals, in this part of the world anyway, Lindsay area, are not maxed out. I have a sister that works there and she says its really nice working there right now, people are staying at home and not running to emerg for sniffles and cut fingers, the sort on non emergency stuff people always swamp the place with. Not disagreeing that first responders need to be able deal with whats important right now, but its a misconception that hospitals are swamped with covid patients. Most people are staying home to recover, only 3% of patients in the country are need of critical care to date. Unfortunately, when this is all said and done, i imagine the emerg units will return to their normal state of chaos, mostly for no reason."
1059179,lew,2020-04-07 20:15:00,12766,My daughter's been in Toronto Western Hospital  for a week now....not the virus....and she says it's unbelievably quiet in there and almost seems like there's nobody around other than medical staff.
1059181,big guy,2020-04-07 21:07:00,414,Hope she is feeling better soon
1059183,lew,2020-04-07 21:15:00,12766,Thanks big guy
1059192,Crimsongulf,2020-04-08 01:52:00,294,"Even though I am way down south, when I went out the other day, the boat is on a lift in the backyard, I was out about 4 hours and was never closer than 500 yards to another boat.  When we get to the Napanee cottage in June it will basically work the same way."
1059193,John Bacon,2020-04-08 02:09:00,3277,"That could be misleading.  Covid patients have specfic needs such as an ICU & respirator.  Even if half there are a lot of empty beds, they may still be near capacity for the specific needs of Covid patients."

1058974,AKRISONER,2020-04-05 02:10:00,5558,Lol the “essential list” is basically bogus FYI...it’s Inherently designed to simply stop store front operations aside from grocery stores. Aside from that nothing else closes. My brother literally works at a board game distribution company and they Are considered to be an essential service because they are involved in “manufacturing and distribution”  insane right?
1058993,big guy,2020-04-05 14:51:00,414,"Pretty sure no one on this board needs more tackle and you dont need bait to catch fish. Gas stations will always be open. Personally, i want to go fishing and should be able to given the places i usually go, which are off the beaten path."

1058998,LefroyFisherman,2020-04-05 15:29:00,602,I do the exact same thing BillM
1058999,Terry,2020-04-05 15:52:00,14456,I do the exact same thing and I am so close to the lake I don’t think I will need gas for months for the truck and have more cans of gas sitting here then I know what to do with.
1059000,Big Cliff,2020-04-05 16:04:00,6899,Deaths in Canada jumped by 20% today alone and its going to get worse! The biggest cause is people thinking the rules don't apply to them.

1059002,SirCranksalot,2020-04-05 16:15:00,3291,The Notty passes our house but is muddy. Could someone on here pls clean that up ASAP?? 
1059008,big guy,2020-04-05 16:45:00,414,"There have been 258 deaths in Canada so far, 22 of them have come from 1 nursing home in Bobcaygeon. Its caused by close contact, not by being 100s of feet apart on a lake."
1059009,misfish,2020-04-05 16:53:00,29133,Might need to cut up some chicken gibblets and fish for cats Harold . .
1059013,Big Cliff,2020-04-05 17:27:00,6899,"You are a little behind, 274 deaths, over 14,000 cases and unless people start following the rules it going to get even worse and last a lot longer.  You might think you are invincible and you should be able to do whatever you want. I hope and pray that it isn't a member of your family that makes the list because someone wasn't willing to be inconvenienced! One thing I do know, I will do everything I can to make sure I don't contribute to the problem. Too bad many people only seem to care about themselves!"
1059020,big guy,2020-04-05 18:11:00,414,"I understand that you worried about all this, we all are or should be, but I have been living with it since the middle of March when my wife started showing symptoms. She works at the Pinecrest home in Bobcaygeon and was diagnosed with it, her positive test result came back on March 27th. She has since recovered and has had 2 negative tests and is returning to work tomorrow. I'm not saying I am an expert about any of this, but when 1 person of your family has it and brings it home and the other 3 people in the home have yet to develop symptoms (knock on wood), since March 17th or so, it proves that isolation and taking precautions can work. Living in the same home with it, is far different than going fishing for a day where, as I said before, you are literally 100s of feet from another person. In my personal situation, I gravitate toward the smaller lakes of Haliburton and Eastern Ontario, where you see very few fisherman over the course of the day, sometimes none. Even launching in Fenelon, to fish Cameron Lake, you are never that close to another person to be worried about it being transmitted to you. If someone gets within 10 feet, you tell them to back off, it's that simple. Making comments about people being selfish does not help facilitate an intellectual discussion about it either. At the end of the day, the government will make the rules and the police will enforce them. So far there has been no mandatory order to stay home, just a strong suggestion and those suggestions are aimed at the people who weren't being smart in the cities that were taking their kids to parks etc. I don't see how a person fishing on their own in the middle of a lake is anywhere near the same situation. When and I believe it will happen, the government orders us to stay home and the police stop me from towing my boat to my favourite lake, then I will, until then we should be able to fish... with caution and using common sense. It really is a to each his own debate."
1059022,Dutch01,2020-04-05 18:31:00,1431,"I tend to fall more on Cliffs side of the debate as my previous posts would attest. But I do appreciate that you have thought this through using the lens of your personal experience and have come to a different decision than I did. There are degrees of safe conduct and you're not wrong to say people at the park in Toronto are a whole different thing than you alone on a lake in Hali.  However there are still good reasons why the police don't want you to travel. They've been posted before So I won't repeat them again. A lot of people are saying they will stop when the law forces them to. That actually does make the job of the government harder.  It's not easy for a federal government to declare martial law, it changes the dynamic of the federal provincial relationship. It actually takes a lot of power away from Premiers who are local and probably have the best idea of what's needed in their province. It forces the federal government to manage over the premiers on many different battle fronts. And the Premiers have been asking Trudeau not to do it for this reason.  But as far as I know the Premiers cannot legally force us to stay inside, that has to be federal. That is why they are literally begging people to comply rather than be forced. Being forced complicates the fight. I am also begging everyone on this board to reconsider. I won't browbeat you all about it (anymore!) but please think about why the PM, Premiers and Mayors are begging you everyday to stay inside. Good luck and stay safe everyone."
1059028,big guy,2020-04-05 18:52:00,414,"Good reply Dutch01, you make a strong case, but I wonder where we would be with all this if the Feds had gotten off their asses earlier than they did. They left the barn door open far too long in my opinion and that is why we're talking about these things, things we shouldn't need to discuss at all. But I guess I am digressing a little. Anyway, we'll see what happens in the very near future."
1059030,lew,2020-04-05 19:29:00,12766,Your wife is a very brave lady big guy and really good to hear she's recovered now.

1059054,Crazy Ivan,2020-04-06 02:53:00,184,"In my opinion it comes down to this. Closing boat ramps is one less burden on the manpower needed to police the waterways. Also if you need to be rescued while on the water for whatever reason it is much harder to get to you than someone walking a dog on the sidewalk. Let's give up our leisure activities for a while, wait this out and save some lives."
1059055,SirCranksalot,2020-04-06 03:00:00,3291,The chances of this petition succeeding is so close to zero that you'd need a microscope to tell the diff!!

1058905,grimsbylander,2020-04-04 16:11:00,3016,"I have no idea what your point is. The thread is about public boat launches. Not launching a small boat from anywhere. If people just can’t reason out the difference between going for a walk and filtering activity through a ramp, this explains why it continues to spread.  	If there was ever a time to use a sledgehammer on a finishing nail, this it it. We can either all observe the rules and be done with this in a month, or cheat because we think we’re smarter than the health officials and still be living this crap in September."
1058906,Dutch01,2020-04-04 16:13:00,1431,I knew you lived close to the lake and I suspected that would form the basis of your argument. Every government official and public health official in Canada is begging people to stay at home and warning that failure to do so will cost lives. As people continue to flout this advice they are bringing in ever stricter measures to try and gain compliance.  If you will only do the right thing when forced to under penalty of law then that is unfortunate.
1058907,Walltrout,2020-04-04 16:16:00,18,I’ll be fishing Monday with my wife. It’s safer to feed us this way then a dirty food store.

If you can avoid going out and possibly spreading the virus stay at home. If you need to go out for an essential trip take all of the precautions that you can. I  wear a  cloth mask over my mouth and use sanitizer  on my hands before I leave my vehicle as well as when I get back in. I do this because I do not want to spread this to my family. I think I might be able to  survive  the virus but what if I don't? What if I do survive it but kill my Mom or brother? I don't want to find out so I do what is needed to lessen the risk. This is NOT the Flu it is much worse. Are we making more of this than what it  needs to be? We will never know because if we do these steps it will be over quicker and have less casualties so it proves both sides of the argument. Take the time to try to understand that  this is not like a war where you know that the enemy is just over the hill and you might die but think about it as a invisible enemy that will attack you 10 days before you know you have been shot.

1058900,Dutch01,2020-04-04 15:26:00,1431,"People typically walk their dog within a few streets distance from home. If you live a few streets from the lake you might have a leg to stand on though I don't think so personally. The overwhelming majority of Ontarians drive, often for hours, to get to a lake. You can be asymptomatic and not even know you are bringing COVID-19 into the small town you are traveling too. The local emergency services and hospitals are staffed to the level of the local populace, and 100 or 1000 additional fisher people in  a region has the *potential* to put a strain on those services. If you have an accident at home and have to be treated you are keeping the potential exposure within your immediate community. If you make any stops on route to the lake (food, gas, restrooms) you are bringing that potential Exposure into another community which is how it spreads. And you may not know you're sick, it is contagious for days before symptoms show up. As far as I know no one here was around for WW2. Hundreds of thousands of Canadians put their lives on hold, most voluntarily, to support their Country and community. Many paid the ultimate price Now our country is asking something so simple and so easy, and all I see is people ranting about their freedom or government conspiracies. Shame on you all. Don't let me see you guys talking about being proud Canadians down the line. You are putting yourself before your country and your people. Wrong is wrong, even if everyone is doing it. Right is right even if no one is doing it."

If you eat some of your catch you are actually doing a service to all if it keeps you out of a grocery store even once. And of course there is far less a chance of contracting this thing out in the middle of a lake than anyone that is essential and goes into work everyday. My wife for one. Rant deleted."

Many members here and/or their loved ones fall into the category of at risk of severe or fatal repercussions. Opening up boat ramps is not the answer. Staying at home and sucking it up is! We are still not getting it.......construction projects still business as usual. Furniture stores like Leons and The Brick still open, go figure!. Cannabis stores still open with social gatherings outside. Some still using Timmies and McD drive throughs and then socializing in the parking lot. Until a unified national effort is in place with ALL non essential services closed and only essential inter-provincial travel (trucks) allowed, this will get MUCH worse, quickly. I can only hope that I am very wrong and say hi to many of you on the water during 2020."

1058651,Big Cliff,2020-04-02 11:41:00,6899,"Good for you, I  doubt your petition will ever amount to much but wrong or right you are fighting for what you want. I have nothing against fishing, in fact I love to go fishing! My issue is you might follow the rules of social distancing at the ramp but you can bet there will be others that won't. It sounds like you are going to do whatever you want regardless of the consequence. I truly hope and pray that neither you or any of your family or friends pay the ultimate price for your actions. Me, well I am going to continue to be socially responsible and do my best to insure that I am not part of the problem."
1058653,Bill,2020-04-02 11:57:00,140,"I think the government had to close boat ramps, both public and privately owned, not to stop those going fishing but to stop those who party at spots on the lake. Lake St. Clair has an area known as Grassy. Huge amounts of boaters gather there to party. The water is only 4 feet deep there so everyone is swimming and having a good time. Just like if they were all in a public pool. I dislike this government decision but I understand the why behind it."
1058655,RPW,2020-04-02 12:07:00,24,"Hi Bill, I completely agree with what you're saying. I do believe this is the reason the government closed the boat ramps, but I feel that they should remain open to those who choose to use the ramp for fishing purposes, and not partying at the Grassies. Rather than shut the ramps down to everyone, they can allow access to those going to fish, and fine the ones who aren't being socially responsible. They keep mentioning these $750 and $1,000 fines for not following the new emergency orders, why not hand a few out to the people who are ruining it for everyone?"
1058657,Bill,2020-04-02 12:11:00,140,The fines will be issued but it isn't going to happen immediately. Party weather isn't here yet.

1058670,AKRISONER,2020-04-02 13:18:00,5558,"the bass boat central forums are full of stories from where the air is warmer and the boats are out in droves. Guys saying last weekend on lake of the ozarks was like the 4th of July...Thats why the ramps are closed. Party boats, people tying boats together, people congregating and swimming in the same areas. Once again, if you actually want to go fishing that bad...you easily can, you just might not be able to fish out of the launch at heritage park in barrie or crystal beach on simcoe is all."
1058676,porkpie,2020-04-02 13:45:00,2521,Your right on the mark Terry!  It’s a much bigger gamble just going to the grocery story and I’m pretty sure some of these guys are doing that 3 times a week right now.
1058677,woodenboater,2020-04-02 13:45:00,2277,you can be sure that people will be holding Columbus Day Regattas much earlier this year. will be same thing as spring break beach crowds. it's the demographic that laughs in the face of the risks
1058679,SmokestackLightnin,2020-04-02 14:10:00,390,"Here is my personal situation.  I have a water access cottage but also own a drive-to lot that has a wet slip boathouse.  Inside the boathouse I have a boat hoisted up and sitting on beams overtop the water for winter storage.  It would be no problem to put my boat in the water without the aid of a public or private boat ramp.  So technically I could launch my boat without breaking the order. However, my opinion is they should be making all waterways closed off, not just the access to them but keep all boats off the waterways.  Yes there will be some extenuating circumstances but stop all pleasure craft use.  Currently our first responders are so taxed in these unsettling times.  I don't think it's the best use of our first responders if they now have to keep an eye on the waterways and potentially rescue or enforce the social distancing orders on the water.  The closure is until April 13.  Yeah, it can and likely will be extended but, if we look at the big picture, we all need to sacrifice and our first responders need all the help they can get right now to focus on the true issue at hand.

1058558,RPW,2020-04-01 16:32:00,24," Please click Here to view the petition on change.org.  Hello Everyone, I have started a petition to try to allow boat launches to be open to people who will be fishing (with some social distancing restrictions). I am hoping the fishing community can help obtain some signatures and share the petition. I am not sure if this will make any difference, but it is worth a try! Thanks!"
1058562,Big Cliff,2020-04-01 16:46:00,6899,NOT A CHANCE! This defeats the STAY AT HOME so this virus doesn't spread. There will be lots of time for fishing once this is over (for those that survive it)
1058566,RPW,2020-04-01 16:52:00,24,"You're definitely entitled to your opinion - but I don't see how jumping in your own boat, alone or with a family member from the same household, and going out on the water to fish is spreading the virus. I don't see how prohibiting this is, in any way, beneficial. Creating new (temporary) rules and regulations prohibiting multiple people, or people outside of your family from fishing together is more reasonable and understandable. I actually see this is counterproductive as the alternative is to stay in your house and do nothing at all? How is this beneficial to our health?"
1058571,BillM,2020-04-01 17:33:00,17367,Not hard to keep your distance at the ramp but common sense isn't so common unfortunately.

Because it keeps people separate where they can't spread the virus. Perhaps you're Captain Awesome, and you won't cause any sort of problem. Unfortunately, there is a large population of asshats in the world, and exceptions to rules only grant them the ability to screw everything up. I read your petition. You're really reaching on a lot of the points you've listed."
1058575,RPW,2020-04-01 17:52:00,24,"Thank you for your reply Ronzo. I do agree that there is a large portion of the population that does not take this seriously, and there are strict fines already in place for these people. What I do not agree with is punishing those who are willing and able to follow the rules of social distancing, and want to have some way to pass the time while doing so - while maintaining personal health and bringing some food home in the process. All of my points can be backed up by some simple research online, and they were all drawn from various sources. The following point is directly from https://www.ontario.ca/page/fisheries-ontario   The following point is not from ontario.ca, but can be found from many other sources. Also, can you argue against fishing benefiting physical and mental health?  https://www.ontarioparks.com/parksblog/health-benefits-fishing/"

Don't you think EVERYBODY would like the opportunity to go for a cruise on the lake to get a break from what's happening these day ? Seems to me you somehow think your better than the family that doesn't fish but enjoys a boat ride."
1058578,RPW,2020-04-01 18:07:00,24,"To be honest Lew, you make a valid point, and I did not consider that. I was more thinking of the people who will launch their boat just to sit at the sandbar surrounded by others. I guess by ensuring there is fishing equipment on board you have a better chance of limiting people from going to the local swim hole..."
1058593,Big Cliff,2020-04-01 19:12:00,6899,"The problem is that YOU might follow the rules but too many others won't.  Where are you going to get gas, where are you going to get bait, tackle..... where are the others going to get their supplies?  Do you WANT to go fishing or do you NEED to go fishing?"
1058595,gaspumper,2020-04-01 19:17:00,393,If your not part of the solution your part of the problem.
1058597,AKRISONER,2020-04-01 19:23:00,5558,"already been said multiple times...Im certain that I could go to the ramp launch my boat and maintain distance, but judging by my experience at the grocery store this week, 1 out of probably every 10 people is completely hopeless. Go and look at the ground at your local grocery store parking lot. The amount of used gloves laying around on the ground for the cart kids to pick up and expose themself too is exactly why they need to close public ramps. Hence, one bad apple or in this case many bad apples amognst the bunch spoils the bunch!"
1058598,RPW,2020-04-01 19:25:00,24,"Hi Cliff, I do agree that a many people won't follow the rules and fines have been set in place for this. It just needs to be enforced. As for getting gas, bait, tackle, etc. there are ways to do so with limited to no contact. For example, a local boat ramp in my town is partly attended, they have a mini bar fridge full of bait at the ramp with a lockbox next to it and a camera aimed at it. You drop your cash in the box, take your bait, and you're on your way. For the boat ramp they have a machine similar to a parking machine. You pay using the machine and it spits out a ticket which you place on your windshield - and there is always someone floating around monitoring the ramp who could sanitize the machine after each customer. As for gas, I would just pull up to the pump as I always do and gas up, then sanitize/wash my hands before I touch anything in my truck. At some point over the next couple of months you're going to need to leave the house to do some kind of enjoyable activity. Not to redirect your point, but I think the more critical focus should be on the list of ""essential businesses"", not people heading out to fish."
1058600,Big Cliff,2020-04-01 19:28:00,6899,"426 new cases in Ontario, the largest single day jump so far, they didn't happen because people are self isolating."
1058601,AKRISONER,2020-04-01 19:28:00,5558,"so inherently what you are implying is that theres lots of ""essential businesses that shouldnt be open"" but the guy that has to hang out and monitor the boat ramp to save the idiots from themselves and from everyone else, while also sanitizing the boat ramp machine is essential? If you need to get the boat out...there are many ways to do so without using a public launch. The great lakes are very very large and have plenty of shoreline that one could manage to launch a boat in if he absolutely had to. But telling everyone that the launch in barrie is open guarantees a total crap show."
1058604,RPW,2020-04-01 19:56:00,24,"Probably partly to do with everyone who ignored recommendations and travelled for March / Spring break. Or the herds of people waiting outside of Costco two hours before they open. Wonder how many of those cases were caused by someone sitting on their own in the middle of the lake fishing... I'm just saying there are ways it can be managed. It is possible (and not very difficult) to get bait, get to the ramp, and go fishing without coming into contact with people. I think fishing is the least of our concerns when it comes to spreading this virus - and I feel that it is counterproductive to prohibit it."

As I ran down the river I saw a guy get out of his truck, he was waiting for me to leave .it is a very safe activity.
