We have a new boat as of last year a 2019 Alumacraft 205 Tiller with a Yamaha VMAX 115hp. I'm not happy with the cover that came with the boat. I would like one that fits over the TM and is snug enough that it doesn't flap on the highway and rain won't pool on it. I'm also looking to be able use when docking over night. Hoping someone can suggest a good place with in a hour of the GTA but I would be willing to travel a couple hours for the right company.  "

1058373,GBW,2020-03-30 16:03:00,8460,I got one done a few years ago at K C's Custom Boat Top's near Fenelon Falls and been very happy with the quality.
1058391,RangerGuy,2020-03-30 20:00:00,564,Thanks guys! I will give them a call
1058392,Old Ironmaker,2020-03-30 20:02:00,8243,"I just picked up the custom cover Reg and his wife made for me last week. A great deal for high quality Sunbrella and totally custom fit including over the elec. bow troller. They even covered my kicker which I didn't ask them to. And they used the boat as a template not the old cover. If you want to get your boat done by him don't wait too long. He is booked solid and I got in only because he had a cancellation. I was quoted $1500.00 by a company in London, I paid 1/2 of that."
1058440,RangerGuy,2020-03-31 13:04:00,564,They are 2 hours from me. Wondering if you had to leave your boat there or did they measure while you waited?

1058446,Musky Plug,2020-03-31 13:52:00,398,There’s a place on Kenora St in Hamilton by the transfer station that does boat covers. I had then do a repair for me a couple years ago.

1058466,Old Ironmaker,2020-03-31 17:25:00,8243,They want your boat there while they do the cover.
1058535,Alan from Texas,2020-04-01 13:51:00,4,"RangerGuy: a comment and then an off topic question. Comment: that is a really nice boat! Question: About the rod holders that are visible in your photo. They do not appear to ""clamp"" all the way across the gunnel. Are they permanently attached rod holders or are they portable? If they are portable, how are they secured since they do not cross the entire gunnel to clamp. The reason I am asking is that although I live in Texas I go to Nestor Falls in NW Ontario to fish Lake of the Woods every year, and the rental boat I use has about the same size gunnels and I cannot find portable rod holders that are wide enough to clamp over the gunnel and I am hoping the ones on your boat are portable. In either case, can you share what brand and model the rod holders are?"

1058585,RangerGuy,2020-04-01 18:48:00,564,"Those holders are mounted on Alumacraft Track brackets. I have since changed those out for 2 72"" Black TraxTech Tracks and 4 matching ratcheting rod tubes"
