1058398,Old Ironmaker,2020-03-30 20:23:00,8243,I was 20 the 1st time I went north of Toronto. It opened up an entire world of cottaging and nature I didn't know existed. I had never been in a boat until then. A real city boy. Great memories and we are still making great memories.  The good old days are what we do today.
