I hope everyone is staying healthy and happy as possible.  Personal distancing NW Ontario style below.   "
1058551,OhioFisherman,2020-04-01 15:27:00,6623,"? LOL, can you get germs at the local bait store? Seriously though you do have to buy minnows? or can you trap them?"
1058553,limeyangler,2020-04-01 15:32:00,5204,"I bought 10 dozen and have a bait tank, our local bait shop is deemed an essential service as it has a laundromat attached. I still don't go there as of last week and will use plastics and mainly fish crappie when the minnows are done. The ling are also active now and I have a whole bunch of frozen ciscos, they will whack a chunk of that on a 3"" Little Cleo, so pretty much keeping ourselves to ourselves out here with 9 acres and the occasional shopping trip and dump runs. Having said that the work i do is supporting people with disabilities to live independently in the community, I am on holiday for the next week but will be returning to work. One of my jobs will be taking clients laundry to the laundromat, so while I'm there might as well load up with bait if needed, yes, only one laundromat in town."
