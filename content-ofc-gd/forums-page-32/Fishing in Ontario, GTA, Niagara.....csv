1059683,porkpie,2020-04-13 17:47:00,2521,"Pal, go out and do some exploring.  The pandemic police are in full force on websites and Facebook.  Anyone who knows isn’t going to tell because Karen will call it in.  Anyone that doesn’t will need to do their own groundwork  or have a good buddy network already in place. "
