1057852,David Chong,2020-03-24 01:33:00,836,"This beast of a Yellow Perch which I do believe was caught in Wisconsin was 17"" long and had a 16"" girth! They didn't scale it for weight as they released it! Absolute GIANT! "
1057866,misfish,2020-03-24 09:37:00,29133,That Is going to make lots of baby's. HUGE
1057867,Woodsman,2020-03-24 11:20:00,1286,"Yup extend the arms toward the camera. Makes it look like a 30"" plus fish. And damn the guy has thick fingers."
1057869,Terry,2020-03-24 11:43:00,14456,Looks to me his elbows  are well back against his body. Not strait out
1057870,Cast-Away,2020-03-24 11:51:00,790,Chernobyl Perch or what?
1057871,buick14,2020-03-24 11:57:00,741,Undeniably Large perch regardless
1057908,GregF2,2020-03-24 21:59:00,46,What a bad pic.  Wish he would have taken a normal picture.
1057935,gordy28,2020-03-25 01:02:00,638,Wow - that perch looks much bigger than the average walleye or at least the average walleye I catch!
1057936,Rizzo,2020-03-25 01:11:00,4754,"what??? That thing is huge...but yes, the camera does appear a little close to the fish. That bruiser doesn't need creative photography"
1057948,Chuck Enwinde,2020-03-25 07:49:00,247,You don't have to extend the arms if you put the camera close to the fish.  The purpose of the photo is to showcase a great fish.  Mission accomplished I say.  Congrats to the angler.
1057953,crappieperchhunter,2020-03-25 11:29:00,2582,Nice fat fish but there is no way anyone could accurately guess its size from this photo. I'm sure many people who target perch like I do have caught fat 12 or 13 inchers and if held as close to the camera as this fish is would get similar photos.
1057993,David Chong,2020-03-25 17:48:00,836,"This fish was on Green Bay in Wisconsin and they measured it at 17"" in length & 16"" in girth! It was released because the season for Yellow Perch there is currently closed!"
1057998,Old Ironmaker,2020-03-25 18:46:00,8243,"17"", why not take a pic of that beast next to a tape measure like many do for trophy fish before released. I don't want to be pessimistic but that guy wasn't doing the elbow tuck. Regardless it is scary huge. edit: I did a unscientific experiment. Assuming the guy is of average height and his arms are pointed straight out from his body I measured the distance from my 2 index fingerswith my arms held out straight from my body  which I measure it to be 12"". The guys right index finger looks to be 1"" from the fishes mouth so +1""=13"". The mans left hand index or ring finger is under the fishes anal fin so I would add another 4"" from the anal fin to the tail pinched together. Guess what? That massive Yellow Perch  measures 17""!!!!! I take my naysaying back. It's a 17"" grotesque Perch."
1058221,Sinker,2020-03-28 14:21:00,8692,Theres lots of video of this fish for all you armchair measuring scientists. Its legit.  S.
1058315,captpierre,2020-03-29 14:43:00,2521,Euro perch?
1058332,misfish,2020-03-29 19:29:00,29133,
1058368,Sinker,2020-03-30 13:09:00,8692,"Pretty quiet in here now, eh? LOL  S."
1058394,David Chong,2020-03-30 20:06:00,836,"Nope, caught in Green Bay, Wisconsin!"
