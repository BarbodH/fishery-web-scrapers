1058803,offgriddin,2020-04-03 15:29:00,39,I am going on a trip off grid and have a power bank and solar charger but it is usb... I need a usb to 6v or 12v that has aligator clips to charge the finder  Does anyone know where I could get this adapter?
1058807,DRIFTER_016,2020-04-03 15:51:00,10439,USB output is 5 volts. The only way is with a DC to DC step up transformer. Look for one like this: https://www.amazon.ca/Step-up-Power-Module-Converter-Connector/dp/B01L6AJS1E Be aware that the process of up-converting uses extra power so you will get lees available power from your bank to charge the battery. You would be better off with something like this. https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/motomaster-eliminator-750a-lithium-ion-booster-pack-and-power-bank-0111906p.html I have one and it outputs 12 volts as well as having a USB port for charging your phone and other small electronics.
1058809,Terry,2020-04-03 15:57:00,14456,"Yeah. Most usb is only 2 amps and 5 amps  at most And I don’t know how many amps your 5 volt solar unit is, by the time you step up to 12 volts  You may not have enough power to drive anything"
1058818,offgriddin,2020-04-03 16:54:00,39,Ok.thanx so much for your replies...it helped a lot
1058819,smitty55,2020-04-03 17:06:00,928,Max usb current is .5A for USb2.0 giving a max 2.5W output. USB3 rises to 900mA max so 4.5W Cheers
1058828,Terry,2020-04-03 18:40:00,14456,Forgot a decimal here and there lol
