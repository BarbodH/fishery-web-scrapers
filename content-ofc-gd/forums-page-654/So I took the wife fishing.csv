487593,grt1,2010-07-23 00:48:00,638,"So I took the wife fishing, this is something she loves to do but her back has been giving her grief for the last few months and she wants the water to be flat before she'll venture out.  I on the other hand have been out a lot, 25 to 30 times and the biggest fish i've caught is 24 3/4 inch walleye.  So the wife nails this one and i haven't heard the end of it    this is one of the largest fish caught on Gullrock this year  28 inches, 7.5 pounds"
487595,spincast,2010-07-23 00:53:00,3279,no wonder her backs sore if every time you take her out she catches fish like that.
487596,alexcba,2010-07-23 00:53:00,634,LOL! nice! hopefully more calm days ahead and she gets out with you more often. great walter!
487604,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-23 01:15:00,0,Very impressive pickerel for Gullrock for sure! Its a shame about her back....Gotta get her some pain killers for when its rough!

487680,bigugli,2010-07-23 11:13:00,6138,"None wrong with that at all. Nice walter.  My mother still likes to put me in my place when we go fishing   It's the way things were meant to be. Look at poor TJ as a classic example. Without his Mrs catching the fish, he might starve."
487683,corvette1,2010-07-23 11:41:00,1765,nice eye congrats to your wife
