487394,Guest LivingLegend,2010-07-22 05:09:00,0,This is my 1st deep cycle battery ( Optima blue top D34M dual ). I understanding charging it correctly is important so my question is: Is it a good idea once I decide to charge it to turn on the motor and let it die out completely? I think its almost due for its 1st charge time and i was gonna just let it run until the prop stopped spinning. Pls advise...........  Thanx!
487397,sauce,2010-07-22 05:48:00,219,Not good for the motor to run it dry. It could overheat. If you want to drain iyour battery maybe run your boat lights with it for a few days. Trickle discharge?
487404,ohhenrygsr,2010-07-22 06:23:00,947,Get a smart charger that will deliver the proper charge at any juice level.  Like a Minn Kota Charger
487411,Terry,2010-07-22 09:01:00,14456,as said get a smart charger it will charge it in 3 stages and that is the best way to charge them
487417,lifeisfun,2010-07-22 10:02:00,99,"That battery is not recommended for deep cycle application: http://www.optimabatteries.com/product_support/charging.php   OPTIMA BlueTop Charging Information The following charging methods are recommended to insure a long battery life - always use a voltage-regulated charger, with voltage limits set as described below.  BlueTop Type: 34M These batteries are designed for engine starting applications. They are NOT recommended or warranted for use in deep cycle applications."
487423,Ksword,2010-07-22 11:12:00,40,"As mentioned, the smart chargers are the way to go.  Also, completely discharging any (including deep cycle) battery is very hard on it..."
487424,scugpg,2010-07-22 11:22:00,1373, That is incorrect. The D34M is designed for Deep Cycle.  Get a proper charger! http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/4/Auto/BatteryChargersAccessories/BatteryChargers/PRDOVR~0111522P/CTEK%252BMulti-use%252B3300%252B3.3A%252BBattery%252BCharger.jsp
487431,Fisherman,2010-07-22 11:42:00,7201,"Not a true Deep Cycle, but a dual purpose model."
487437,Fish4Eyes,2010-07-22 12:15:00,1022,"You should never drain the battery  entirely, unless circumstances force you to. After your done using it, just charge it back up again at a low amperage. When I went to the Interstate warehouse the guy recommended using a CTEK charger."
487511,aplumma,2010-07-22 18:07:00,6896,Your battery is not the same as a lithium battery it does not need to be discharged fully to correct a memory issue. A proper way to get the best life from the battery is to discharge it with your natural fishin trip and then recharge it as soon as you can with a 3 stage charger. A full battery does not have a negative chemical reaction going and does not shorten its life. Keeping the battery on an approved charger plugged in will keep it fully charged and ready for action.

I will run it out during my next fishing adventure and stick it on the charger at 2amp trickle.  Thanx again!!!"
487606,lifeisfun,2010-07-23 01:17:00,99," Sure, I guess optima doesn't know what they making"
487641,Guest LivingLegend,2010-07-23 02:37:00,0,  It is for both starting and deep cycle applications. I have a three stage charger and will charge it on the lowest amp (2amp).
487643,Guest LivingLegend,2010-07-23 02:41:00,0,  Forgot to add that the blue top battery with dark grey case isnt for deep cycle like the website you posted......but the blue top light grey case is the dual for both starting and deep cycle.
487679,scugpg,2010-07-23 10:56:00,1373, My bad you are right. I have 2 I should know
