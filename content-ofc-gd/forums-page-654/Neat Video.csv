487229,fish-miester,2010-07-21 18:05:00,864,thats pretty cool. using small pike as bass bait!
487239,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-21 18:49:00,932,Classic Video - Makes me love Bass (and the 5 of diamonds) that much more.  Thanks for sharing TJ.
487255,alexcba,2010-07-21 20:02:00,634,lol TJ dont you know its against the law to use sport fish as bait?
487272,ch312,2010-07-21 21:36:00,1590,"cool video...but i thought fish should are suppose to be landed as quickly as possible to limit the amount of stress on the fish? if it were a musky, even you would somehow be banned from here"
487340,TJQ,2010-07-22 00:55:00,7806,LOL Point taken..
487360,OhioFisherman,2010-07-22 01:45:00,6623,Ever been fighting a smallie and seen 3 or 4 more following it? Trying to steal the food?
487384,alphaalpha,2010-07-22 03:50:00,475,"That's pretty neat, i always figured the fight of catching a fish would spook the others at least for a short time...."
487385,Bly,2010-07-22 03:54:00,1556,"Cool TJ.  I love seeing the underwater vids that you post, they answer many questions."
487569,bassjnkie,2010-07-22 22:44:00,1101,Cool!! Great video!!
487648,young_one,2010-07-23 03:01:00,620,"LOL, looks like you are jigging for smallie with a live pike as bait! Good quality waterproof camera."
487673,Handlebarz,2010-07-23 09:05:00,3790,That was cool Tj but I think that ch312 has it wrong there you can take your time fighting a fish to get it in and as for stress on this fish I think it made out just right the bigger question is why Tj does not listen to his mother maybe one day he will stop playing with his food   I could just imagine a swift backhand if ya lost dinner there Tj.
487687,corvette1,2010-07-23 11:45:00,1765,cool video tj
487930,Leecher,2010-07-24 00:36:00,7832,Cool video TJ But I think you need to put in some heavy rock audio to harmonize the suspense   just saying   but that's just me Leechman
487968,TJQ,2010-07-24 02:46:00,7806,LOL.. I had youtube add a blues toon... he couldnt have been happy!!!
487977,Leecher,2010-07-24 03:25:00,7832," LOL  TJ, not sure which program you use for creating vids but I use Windows Movie Maker and it allows you to import vids, audio and pics.  I use Photobucket for my uploads but are real pain for MP3's.  When creating the vid in MV, the trick I found is to re-size it to remove the beginning of the song which contain the copyright information that Photobucket or Youtube scans for.  I know that Youtube will remove the audio of the vid that's being uploaded and let you share it without sound and you will have a chance to select from a list of songs that are not copyrighted.... Photobucket will deny your upload.  That being said.... here's a vid I made last February while ice fishing with my daughter... most likely seen it and you'll notice that I have 4 different songs that are playing throughout.... my kind of tunes Enjoy Leechman  <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvid732.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fww321%2Fleechman1%2F2010%2FHardWaterFishing-FatherDaughterDuo.mp4"">"
