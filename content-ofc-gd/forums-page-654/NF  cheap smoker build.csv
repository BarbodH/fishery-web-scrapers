Finally got around to it, taking me from horizontal to UDS :roll:  My good friend Jim is a boss at a barrel mfg. plant 3 miles away ( Berenfield),& got me some brand new drums.  So, I burnt this one out, then took it to the carwash & pressure washed it.    burnt & washed..   Drilled 3/4 holes 2"" from bottom, figure the refridg. magnets are the way to go for me. Bought Weber charcoal rack & 22.5 food rack. Put 6"" X 3/8"" carriage bolts in to hold the charcoal rack {{ figured a guy COULD use 4 red bricks on  edge to support the charcoal rack, too :idea:  }}  Charcoal rack & can in place..    painted with 500` engine paint, installed 2"" X 12"" nipple in bung.  test fire.    yanked the can out, after 20 min put lid on waited 30 min. checked temp    half-hour late I figured might a swell not waste the fire & tossed come chik pieces on. To my surprise, temps hold VERY WELL :!:   just puffin' away..    anyway, I'm learning to 'smoke upright' thanks to the Ringers   :wink: I DID have to remove the small bung in the lid,too. I'll need to learn 'Tweaking the Temp"" with it.    OH BTW...I left the lid off ( by accident) while I was prepping the chicken...temp SHOT to over 500`...so I tested the paint...did good!"
487535,misfish,2010-07-22 19:51:00,29133,Chicken looks delish.  I like tht old smoker in the back ground.You still use that one? Is it an old missil ?
487543,fishnsled,2010-07-22 20:13:00,3520,Beats the price of the Big Green Egg.  Chicken looks GOOD!!!
487549,Rodwrap,2010-07-22 20:54:00,130,"LOL...the ol' gal in the back was given to me about 6 years ago. I ""cut my teeth"" on the old horizontal stickburner. I think it's made from an old boiler of some kind.  My 'problem' is I need more capacity as my BBQ expands. The drum smoker is VERY effecient...airtight...easily controlled...& I can leave it for 6-8 hours unattended.  The old horizontal, thou, is at least 3/8"" thick stuff..once I get it warmed up, It cooks the same even if it's 10 below outside..."

After years of looking at being built, seeing them in progress and looking at the final result..(that being food) I have been looking for a source for a food grade drum for some time.. but have come up empty  anyways... good looking cook! I would hit them!  G"
