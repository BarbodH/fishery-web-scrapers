485628,timmeh,2010-07-15 23:55:00,609,"Been out a few times in the last few weeks and found the fishing pretty hit and miss. Some days I've only found the dinks but I've had a couple real good days. Took the fly rod out for bass and got into some pretty good numbers, including a 17"", but the camera batteries were dead so no photos. But even 10"" smallie can put up a nice battle on the fly rod, and the big guys are just a riot.  Still get out with the spinning gear for a little wading as well. He's a shot of the biggest of the year, a solid 20"" from the Canada Day weekend.     Every once in a while I pick up a few of these guys too..     Have notice quite a few deer around too.     It required a bit of patience but I was able to get quite close to this fella. He was quite curious, and even though I was swinging around the fly rod he didn't run. Hopefully he wises up by fall.     Hellgrammite     Crayfish     And a couple frogs that I haven't IDed yet but am going to look up soon. Any ideas?    "

485641,lunkerbasshunter,2010-07-16 00:29:00,2585,  Pike i think?  Great pics!  awesome deer shots!  cheers!
485669,houski,2010-07-16 01:31:00,61,"Wood Frog, and Gray Tree Frog respectively."
485698,timmeh,2010-07-16 02:57:00,609,"The second pic is a pike. I got a little to close and the image is a little blurry. I'm still learning to use the camera, hence the experimenting with colors on the first 2 pics.  Houski, I thought that the last one was a gray tree frog, but wasn't sure about the first one, thanks for the info."
485707,alexcba,2010-07-16 03:19:00,634,lol that pike looks pissed!
487289,houski,2010-07-21 22:30:00,61,You're welcome. Fish and Wildlife and Natural Resources Law Graduate here...lol. So I should know.
487300,Bob,2010-07-21 23:19:00,370,The frog on the stump looks like what we call a spring peeper around here.  There are a zillion of them in the marsh out back but you have to look really hard to find them.  They're loud but nearly invisible.
487334,houski,2010-07-22 00:45:00,61,"Spring peepers are a dull green colour, and have a darker green, or brown 'X' pattern on their backs."
487393,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-22 04:14:00,932,Great Report Tim.  I can't even find the frog in the first frog pic.  We saw an Egret @ the bass spot tonight but failed to get it on camera sadly - it was massive.
487432,blaque,2010-07-22 11:50:00,2419,"  lol, i had to go back like numerous times to spot the frog"
