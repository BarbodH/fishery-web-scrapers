487753,Terry,2010-07-23 15:05:00,14456,I was looking for Maxwell House Coffee Singles for a fly-in fishing trip I have had them before and they are not too bad..not tim hortons but better then instant  I could not find them anywhere checked their website..pretty but useless as hell hit contact link and it takes you to karft canada website I wrote them 3 emails over a 1 month period asking where In this area could I buy them as their website states they are at selected stores only  not a word from them........you would think they would just not put up a contact link rather then no answering questions............  so screw them and the kraft dinner they rode in on  does anyone know where they sell them in the bradford/north of toronto area or what do you do for fresh brewed coffee in the north country

487770,Terry,2010-07-23 15:26:00,14456,thanks the superstore in newmarket didn't seem to have them  I will go back and ask them again thanks
487777,troutologist,2010-07-23 15:33:00,951,"Are you on a canoe type trip where weight is an issue?  I usually bring a perc and ziplock full of coffee.  Also bring filters for the perc it makes cleanup much easier.  Starbucks singles are good too but pricey, I buy a couple for a treat and drink the regular stuff mostly.  Another trick when you can't fit a big perc in is to hoard the single (tea bag type) coffee packs from hotels. This way you can brew in a regular pot and not worry about grounds."
