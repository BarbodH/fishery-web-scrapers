She says over by the A channel.I say Ok.So off we go.She knows that turkey and deer have been in the area,cause Bob shows them during his weather report. .Hell were just accross the road.So not thinking much,I put on the flip flops,,,,,,,Head on over for a stroll to see if we see any animals. No animals just feathers,,,,  She,s happy      Now I get,,,Lets go for a venture into the bush,,,,,OK    Looking like a good deer trail,I say ok lets venture. Boy we found alot of stuff.  The guys that drag this in, must of really need a dime bad.    On we go and come a cross the mrs,s fav berry.    Not far away, was this old pan.It was very heavy and had to be old.Sorry for the look away,she got bit.LOL I warned her about the skitters.    It,s amazing what you will find in a small bush.Old fence lines,,,     Old jugs,,,,No, not my mrs,s. Good thing I and she, have a sense of humor .    OH OH,getting dark.Not really,but with the heavy green cover from the trees,the bush was getting dark. Now this is where she finds out who knows what.Cant stress the mrs,s out. I say to her,just head for the sound of the road.I knew where we were,but this would be a good test for her.I let her lead the way.She finds a mud hole.but was still egar to find her way.    And I must say she did a great job.She found her way to the raod.    And bringing up the rear was I.Never leave a lady behind,    Home for a quick wash up,,,Oh ,did I say I wore my sandels for this little walk? LOL    We went though alot of stickles and swamp.It was a great adventurus walk for us. She now understands what we go through in the fall. I for one will not tell her,it much easier in the fall.  That was fun.  It aint a fish,n report , but it,s liv,n."
