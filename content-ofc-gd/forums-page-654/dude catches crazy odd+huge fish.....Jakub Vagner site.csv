487725,NAW,2010-07-23 14:07:00,4022,Those are some crazy looking fish!
487731,craigdritchie,2010-07-23 14:17:00,1586,"The 'Russian steelhead things' are taimen. They're found in lakes and rivers in central to eastern Russia, and can reach more than 200 pounds (though the average is closer to 25). Strong fight, but they don't seem to jump much. Sort of fight like a big laker."

I've always been interested in foreign monster fish.  2 other globetrotting guys who I've been following over the years via magazines, films and articles are:  Henry Gilbey (if you're a photography nut, you'll enjoy his work) http://www.henry-gilbey.com/photo_essays.html  and  Tony Davies Patrick (aka Globetrotter)- He used to have a better web-site with a gallery. http://www.wilderness-photo.co.uk/"
