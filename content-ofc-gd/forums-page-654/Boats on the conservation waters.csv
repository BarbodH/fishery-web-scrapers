Any info would be great."
487924,ld17,2010-07-24 00:20:00,319,you will be able to launch with your outboard no problem.  You can bag it if you want but you don't have to.  I was there last week and the place is very choked with weeds.  The bass bite is dead almost.  The crappie bite was very slow.  I caught lots of bluegills though.  Bring a push pole if you have one to get right in the thick weeds and try flipping for the bass.  Good luck there.  If you need any more info just give me a shout.

487927,bigugli,2010-07-24 00:28:00,6138,Best to call ahead. Each conservation authority has it's own definition of the no motor rule.
487928,vinnimon,2010-07-24 00:34:00,2593,  Electric only for both!
487933,skankbutta,2010-07-24 00:50:00,32,Deer Creek will not let you on the water with a gas motor on your boat. I know this first hand.
487936,smally21,2010-07-24 01:02:00,993,"they are hit and miss. the grca policy states no gas motors, some let you some dont.  same with hamilton and niagara.  binbrook allows the boat as long as they can see the motor in the upright position.  i email or phone a human to get an answer (and take a name and print it out) before dragging the boat there.  by now you cant canoe through the slop at half of these places, and the fish are only on their websites. still beats working!"
487963,The Urban Fisherman,2010-07-24 02:28:00,2050,I second deer creek not letting you.... no chance at all.  I was able to wrangle up permission last year for my fish-a-thon for cancer and people who have trailers at the reservoir were complaining about it....
