He just returned from a week up there and told me about all the slab crappie he and his wife caught!. Well it didn't take too much convincing on his part to talk me into goin up for a few days! We fished  Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and half of Wednesday and the fishing was phenominal! We caught slabs and some smaller ones nonstop! Funny thing is we got them in four feet of water right off the dock and also near the lily pads ! Water temp was 80 deg. and i've never heard of crappie being this shallow in such warm water! My buddy says that all kinds of strange things happen on his lake so it dosn't surprise him! I always thought that after the spawn they headed out to deep water but i guess i'm wrong! Anybody have the same experience in the Kawarthas this year or ever. Please help me unravel this mistery!"

They're in pretty thick right now over weed flats that are in about 15 FOW, but the top of the weeds are only 3 feet or so down from the surface.  Cheers, Ryan"
487726,frozen-fire,2010-07-23 14:08:00,542,"gil, what time are you getting these slabs?  I find that schools of crappie will roam into shallower water during the evening hours and into the night. During the afternoon, in the high sun, they will be out in deeper water. Only select locations get really dense schools of slabs though. Looks like you have a good spot. I find these locations where the fish congregate in the shallows changes from year to year."

487730,gil,2010-07-23 14:17:00,41,  We got them from 7 am till about 10am right off his dock. Then evening bite was from about 8 pm till 9 pm then misteriously shut down  ( or we caught them all!!! LOL!)
