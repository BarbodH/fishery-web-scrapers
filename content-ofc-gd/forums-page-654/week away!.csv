Had a great week away at the cottage (south of Espanola on Lang Lake)and managed to get in some good fishing time   ...Lots of variety, except the one we have been trying to get (walleye)...none the less, had to show you a quick pick of my GF's first 5 pounder...we weighed it on a RAPALA and it hit 5.04oz....nice fight and a beauty!  hope this pic works  if not: cheers!
