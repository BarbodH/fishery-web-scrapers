482915,alexcba,2010-07-06 16:59:00,634,"our long weekend went fantastic. the walleye were in thick whether you were trolling, or casting it was insane with the amount of hook ups we had all weekend. from thursday to sunday afternoon we boated dozens upon dozens of walters and smallies.  on saturday afternoon we were heading back to the docks and decided to troll there. about 100 yards from the dock my rod bent over and at first i thought i had snagged some of that top water grass. so i killed the motor and stood up, the moment i did that my reel started to peel off, i looked over at vince and said ""not grass, not a wally!"". to my amazement this thing came out of the water by about 6 feet right next to a bass boat and started taking line again. i started to worry cause i was 5 mins in and had the wrong rod on. i was using my 7 ft medium fast buck tail burning rod. i was casting a live target perch with it and had 15 pound braid on. the reason i worried was for the fish, i can always by more tackle. so i tightened up on the drag, kicked the boat into gear and started a pursuit with the boat. she was headed right for our dock. the fight lasted about 10 mins total and she finally gave up and let me gill her out of the water.  we took a couple of pics (still waiting on others from my friends cam, he also has the release pics) and measured her at 48 in the water. it took a really long time to get her swimming again. i was bent over the boat for a good hour + before she finally tried to rip my arm off and took off under the dock. i waited around the dock for a few hours drinking beer and watching the water to make sure she didn't belly up. later on i took a few casts off the dock and directly under me when my lure got close to the dock i saw her bolt off into the deep. i was so happy she got back to her self again that i had a huge smile and finally wanted to go out again.  heres the one pic i have, i will update the rest of the pics once i receive them.     better pic.   the release   more release.. this went on for about an hour and a half..   moooorreeee release..  after we got out again about 15 mins in and about 100 yards in the opposite direction i was casting out a live target perch again (3 inch 6-8 ft diver) on the edge of a weed line dropping off into about 15 fow. i saw a huge silver flash out of the corner of my eye and POW! another ski. with the mate right beside. we fought for about 10 mins, got it to the boat and at this time i was using a flouro leader, and my newbie fishing buddy got a little excited and even tho i told him not to bother with the net he attempted to scoop it and nailed the line with the net tubing (no rubber on it) and clipped it off. not like it would have done anything anyways.. this thing was damn near a foot longer than the last one and fatter. quarter of its head wasn't going in lol. anyways i had an incredible weekend. sorry for the wall of text. i will update once i get the other pics."
482917,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-06 17:06:00,2690,"Nice post, congrats on the 'ski!  Too bad about the ""net incident""."
482920,fishindude,2010-07-06 17:16:00,220,"Awesome stuff alex, seems like you really got a hold of things on Rice.  Keep the reports comin man!"
483014,alexcba,2010-07-06 22:00:00,634,"yeah man. the sonar helps big time tho.. i mean we found this small hump in the middle of the lake in about 10fow that held so many smallies. anyone that doesnt have a fish finder, get one, learn how to use it, and you will never regret it."
483019,LegitFish,2010-07-06 22:23:00,69,"What size of live target were you using? I totally have to get one, just not sure what size.."
483023,alexcba,2010-07-06 22:27:00,634,"i was using the 3 inch perch, got both musky on it, plus most of the walleye. i got quite a few smallies on the crawfish too. it works great cause it has an incredible low speed wobble."
483025,Raf,2010-07-06 22:32:00,3495,"nice rice fish  but your tape measure must start at 8"" ?"
483027,lunkerbasshunter,2010-07-06 22:33:00,2585,nice ski!  Cheers!
483028,alexcba,2010-07-06 22:36:00,634, if i was gonna lie i would have said 50 lol. it was 48.. maybe the fact that im a rather large human being makes it appear smaller to you? buh..
483030,Guest gbfisher,2010-07-06 22:41:00,0,An hour long arm tearing release.......  Nice one.
483033,tightline,2010-07-06 22:52:00,322,Pretty fish Bud!!!  Dang I love personal bests  !!!!! Congrats
483063,Rizzo,2010-07-07 00:16:00,4754,good for you sticking with the fish for a successful release. Maybe I read something wrong but are you saying the next fish was 60 inches long (foot longer than the first one)???? Perhaps you were being sarcastic (which is so dang hard to figure out through computer!
483065,Syn,2010-07-07 00:26:00,519,Great job! Looks like a good size. But how did you survive in those track pants. Weather is soooo hot.
483067,alexcba,2010-07-07 00:29:00,634," lol i was being sarcastic there. it was more like half a foot, and thicker lol."
483132,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-07 03:04:00,0,Nice ski. Sucks about the one that got away and the net. I hear there is not alot of Musky in Rice but there are some real monsters.
483188,fishermccann,2010-07-07 15:10:00,655,"Yes when fishing for Ski. the moment of truth is the netting of the monster, it does not always go according to plan."
483199,Sketty55,2010-07-07 16:04:00,52,Really glad to see the extra effort made to ensure that this ski lived another day to fight! Good for you!!
483266,alexcba,2010-07-07 21:55:00,634," LOL! it was cold in the morning, didn't realize we would be out as long as we were. at about 1030 am i was in my boxer briefs before we started to head back  friggen hot!"
483268,Handlebarz,2010-07-07 21:59:00,3790,great story and very nice pic Congrats on a great Slimmer some times in the hotter weather they take a bit to get going but as long as they are keeping them selves up right you can let them go and just watch them  to make sure that some  jet ski does not run them over.  Looking forward to some of the other pics
483270,Roy,2010-07-07 22:26:00,13728,"A really nice fish Alex, way to go!"
483272,Ron,2010-07-07 22:26:00,1683,"HEY! GET OFF MY SPOT!                    Just kidding, nice fish though! My calculations put that Muskie at 49 inches btw.  (Sreiously, every bit of 49 inches I would say).  Cheers, Ron..."
483300,Leecher,2010-07-07 23:36:00,7832,Beauty ski Alex    Congrats
483305,ehg,2010-07-07 23:51:00,2666,"Nice 40+ inch musky, good thing you stayed the duration making sure it was alive."
