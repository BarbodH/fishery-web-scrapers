The only thing different is that there is not a lot of bait fish in the the general vicinity as there is in the fall. So I put a worm inside the trap to try and get some extra attention to it. Any suggestions as to what else I could use as bait?"

487461,livinisfishin,2010-07-22 14:03:00,661,Would I just break a piece off and just put it in the trap or do I need to hang it inside?
487464,torco,2010-07-22 14:11:00,656,just break up some pieces of bread and put it the trap. It should help attract minnows.
487465,smally21,2010-07-22 14:13:00,993,i dont do alot of minnow catching these days (or fish really) but when i was a kid i slayed the minnows by the dozen on lake huron with bread. the crust lasts the longest just throw it in the trap.  take the bread out if there is any left or you catch mice in the boathouse with it....
