I have been enjoying it to date, and was somewhat reminded by my family last night at the dinner table of the frequency of my enjoyment: as we ate some port hope trout (courtesy of fishunter charters - thanks Lloyd!)  My son - Dad, this fish is delicious - is it one you caught My Wife - What do you think Garreth, what's your Dad done evey weekend since fishing season opened? My Son - Fish My Daughter - Fish, My Wife - fish, fish, fish Me - um, I know there was at least one weekend I didn't ....."

We do have to remember that family is important as well, great when you can combine the two at times...but, sometimes they just want to do something different. Funny on the fishhunter trout...Juli and I just finished the last of our walleye caught with Lloyd at Quinte tonight!!!"
