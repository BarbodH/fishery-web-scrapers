487073,Cudz,2010-07-21 05:28:00,2652,"I had a big rant about this but luckily, probably for me, it got erased. Here are my basic points You get a university degree you get paid more.  That is the bottom line. Of course there are exceptions to the rule but they are just that, exceptions. Here are some easy to follow chart (I bet even some university grads could understand them) Compare a high school diploma salary with a basic bachelor's degree salary http://www.earnmydegree.com/online-education/learning-center/education-value.html  Even SMART people don't always hire experience over education.  Bill Gates Microsoft is known to do the opposite.  Rarely hires experience and almost always hires fresh uni grads. RIM does the same and both companies hire more students from the University of Waterloo than any other uni in the world. http://uwaterloo.ca/aboutuw/  I am not sure what you mean when you say ""some university grads couldn't even fill out a resume.""  Did you mean they couldn't fill out an application form? Did you mean they didn't create a resume or hand in a resume?  I have never filled out a resume at a job so I too might fail that test.  Knowledge of resume creation is generally not taught at university.  The potential employee's failure to submit a resume, or their innability to create a resume, probably stems from being absent too many days while in high school, where that skill is taught.  Resume writing is taught in the careers studies, a grade 10 compulsory course (all students are required to pass in order to graduate high school).  This is a half credit course and the course code is GLC 2O.  Perhaps these uni grads went to school before this course was compulsory.  I do agree that there are many brilliant people out there without a formal post secondary eduction, but those people are certainly few and far between these days.  As unfortunate as it might seem for some, post secondary education, whether at a college level, a university level, or via the trades route is almost essential for those higher paying jobs (note I said almost, there are some great factory jobs and entrepreneurship possibilities out there).  Good luck with the job search.  Keep your chin up something will happen for you as you are still young."

487118,JohnF,2010-07-21 13:30:00,3494,"Think outside the box. It's amazing what great ideas are out there.  Look at this one definition of the word ""paradigm"" - ""A set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality for the community that shares them, especially in an intellectual discipline.""  Now apply that definition to your career search. And then ask yourself if you're really looking for a career, or just another job. Of the possibilities you're considering, do you see yourself being happy in them for the rest of your working life? Remember that excepting professional athletes, too many career trades can be counter-productive.  A good friend of mine started jumping companies looking for something better. On the plus side he reduced his daily commute to 30 minutes. He increased his annual salary by over $100,000. He qualified for bigger annual performance bonuses (6 figure bonuses). He got out of NYC and into downtown Boston (that's an improvement for some folks). The downside was that each new position was progressively less satisfying and he finally had a serious nervous breakdown (in the words of his Ph.D medical author wife ""He had a total meltdown"").  Now he works for the harbourmaster in a small New England island port collecting berth fees from yachting tourists. He loves it, says he's happy as a clam. He wears shorts to work all summer and has his own little harbour boat to tool around in. He tells me he should have stepped back years ago and looked at all his options. Instead he just reacted to the money, titles and prestige caring nothing for personal happiness. They are wonderful folks but somewhere along the line they lost connection with their kids who have grown into dysfunctional screwups (their mother's words).  I'm not suggesting that this is likely to be your story but merely offer it for the insight my friend finally found, painfully - that one needs to step back, analyze, then be proactive in choosing a career.  Hopefully it will get you looking at more than just the obvious employment solutions. Even if you have current financial responsibilities to honour you should still look at all your options. Here's another cliche that applies ""Short term pain for long term gain.""  JF"

Demand in the field is high and the jobs are competitive.  it took me a full year of applying to get in even after I had my education done  and was  licensed by the Ministry of the Environment.  the reality is, good jobs will take time to land, thats usually the way it works. so don't panic. it takes time.  in the mean time, try to get something just to keep cashflow coming in. it prevents resume gaps and shows future employers you were making good use of your time off in between 'real jobs'.  one thing that you might consider is once you are working again is doing night school at a local college or university. I did this for two years and earned a business certificate from the University of Toronto while working days at the wastewater plant. you can do a few courses per year, basically you have class one night per week for 3 hours. it is a good way to upgrade skills, get a diploma on the wall and pad that resume for future employers. You can also do online courses too.  here is the link for U of T's continuing education school. no prerequisites are required so anyone can apply:  http://learn.utoronto.ca/site3.aspx  have a look around.  as far as the education thing goes, it can be tough out there if you don't have the degree or diploma. thats the reality of the job market these days. I did a university degree and a year of college and it was still tough. the Bill Gates's of the world are the exception, not the rule.  thats where something like nightschool can really help.  a family memember of mine recently got laid off from a management position after 12 years. He is running into issues because he didn't finish university way back when so he doesn't meet the educational requirements for anything remotely close to what he was doing. it sucks.  it sucks because you can be an expert in your feild, have great experience and some yahoo in the HR department puts your resume in the 'do not call' pile just because  you don't have a degree or diploma. its crap if you ask me. but unfortunately, it happens all the time.  best of luck and keep your head up. you will find something and look into upgrading your education with nightschool. it can only help.  -12 Volt"
