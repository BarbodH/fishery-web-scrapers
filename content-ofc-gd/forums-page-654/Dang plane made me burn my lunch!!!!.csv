487851,DRIFTER_016,2010-07-23 19:21:00,10439,I got home for lunch just after noon today and after dropping a couple of hot italian snausages on the grill heard some jets running around out back. Off I go to have a look see. It's the annual Yellowknife Air Show this weekend so I figured it wasn't Westjet. LOL I was right!!! It was the Snowbirds running through their routine for tommorrow. I ended up watching them for nearly a 1/2 hour so needless to say the brats were burnt (but still edible). I snapped a few shots (sorry about the quality though)
