487693,solopaddler,2010-07-23 12:29:00,8605,"So I'm talking to my dad last night to see how things are going. Him and my mother have been up at the camp for the last few days.  Even with the low water there are no rock hazzards in my lake. Apparantly though 2 days ago my dad smashed into a huge one and screwed up the lower end on my almost new 40hp Yamaha.  ""Where did it happen?"" I asked.  ""It was those rocks in front of the cabin"" he says.  ""What, you mean the small island? You hit the island?"" I ask in disbelief.  ""Yes the island!"" he sputters.  ""Okaaaay"", says I, ""What's wrong with the motor, how badly is it damaged?"".  ""Well the forward and neutral gear doesn't work anymore, so I had to backtroll the boat back to the marina!""  (This is about 8km away  )  ""Did you get the boat to a mechanic?"" I ask.  ""I was going to, but then I realized I left my trailer hitch at home!""  ""So what did you do?""  ""I grabbed one of Perry's extra boats then left a message on his cel asking if he could tow the boat into town for me. (Perry owns/runs the slips where my boat is moored and is a friend).   ""Okay then"" says I, ""I'll keep my fingers crossed"". ""So beyond that how has everything else been going?""  ""Not good"" says my dad.  ""What do you mean? What else has happened?""  (By this time I'm starting to get nervous).  ""Well yesterday I had a huge leech on my big toe!""  ""So what?!"" I say laughing.  ""Well we couldn't get the damn thing off and it inflamed my gout!"" He practically yells.  ""It got so bad your mother had to drive me to the hospital in Kirkland Lake!"" (Picture George Castanza's dad yelling now  )  By this time I'm laughing at him, and that made him angrier.  ""On the way back from the hospital the front left tire blew out on my van!!""  ""OMG, really?!"", I say.  ""YES REALLY! AND MY SPARE TIRE WAS FLAT TOO!""    ""Okay, okay calm down. How did you get the tire fixed?""  ""I called CAA. They came, but it took hours. We just got back to the camp 15 mins ago. I've got to go, I need a drink! I'll call you tomorrow!!"".   (I hope my motor is okay, guess I'll find out today.  )"
487695,Terry,2010-07-23 12:33:00,14456,ah yes you have got to love them
487696,solopaddler,2010-07-23 12:37:00,8605, For my entite life dad has been my inspiration and my hero.  As he's aged he's slipped a tiny little bit and I worry about him.  (Especially when he's at a water access camp with my mother 7 hours north).  He's still a tough old dude though.
487697,The Urban Fisherman,2010-07-23 12:38:00,2050,"LOL Mike that was a great way to start my day!  Hope your pops is alright, as well as your motor.  My dad's got the same thing going on with gout.  Enjoy your day bud!  cheers, Ryan"
487698,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-23 12:38:00,2690,"Now THAT is a string of bad luck.  My old man's latest, was thinking he is still 20 (actually 74) playing soccer with one of the better halfs boys.  Dove for the ball and just about put himself out of commission. Good luck with the motor"
487700,Grimace,2010-07-23 12:39:00,2020,But other than that things were going well?
487702,Rattletrap2,2010-07-23 12:48:00,1652,"Solopaddler, I fail to see either the humour or comedy in any of this! That......in a nutshell....is my life! Sucks getting old! Not that I couldn't hit rocks or have flat tires when i was younger, but it didn't all seem to happen in the same trip back then! LOL  Hope things take a turn for the better for both of them. I'm sure they deserve this R&R! Yeah, right!"
487705,solopaddler,2010-07-23 12:54:00,8605, It happens to everyone no doubt.  Personally I found it hilarious though.  I'm sure things will be take a turn for the better. As far as my dad goes he's still more than capable 90% of the time (he has his own business and still puts in 60 hour weeks).  That's what makes these mishaps even funnier.
487708,John,2010-07-23 12:59:00,2956,"Thanks for making my morning Mike.......after cleaning my keyboard of coffee I can relate to your post. Barbara and I are dealing with her Dad who in his 80's is reverting back to his teens. God love him, but sometimes we need to take a walk to avoid killing him. We need to remember that they brought us into this world and mostly were responsible for our growth as humans.....I find that Scotch helps...a lot...  J..."
487743,doubleheader,2010-07-23 14:51:00,497,That was priceless
487747,alexcba,2010-07-23 14:57:00,634,hahahaha poor guy..  
487759,ccmtcanada,2010-07-23 15:14:00,7971,Oh man Mike...  Thing is...I've met your dad and seen how you two interact....and can totally picture this conversation between the two of you!!! LOL.  Hope all works out ok!!
487760,Joey,2010-07-23 15:14:00,9122,"That's funny Mike.  I'm reading a book right now called ""Sh**t my Father Says"" and its very funny.  You'd probably enjoy it so if you ever come across it at a store, buy it.  Joey"
487765,TC1OZ,2010-07-23 15:20:00,987,"  Story of my life! When it rains, it pours. At least when good things happen they happen to me this way as well!  "
487788,highdrifter,2010-07-23 15:58:00,2534,"HAHAH!!  That was great Mike.  My old man is starting to slip too..  His favourite responce to the old ""what do you want for your birthday?"" question is:  ""I want a brain transplant...""  cheers brother HD"
487795,Cookslav,2010-07-23 16:17:00,1457,"LOL...  Ya parents get funny as they age...especially when ""the routines"" start LOL!  My parents now have ""shopping day""(Wed), and ""visit day""(Mon), and every saturday my Dad HAS to go to my uncles auto shop...the shop is closed so they usually tinkers with small engines, drink beer, and smoke cigars...not much Auto work going on LOL!  It makes me laugh, but hey...if they are happy and healthy its all good. Cheers,"
487796,bigugli,2010-07-23 16:18:00,6138,"It may be funny   and your laughing now  , but remember this lesson I give to my son. Your dad is the mirror image of you in days to come. It will come back to haunt you."
487833,solopaddler,2010-07-23 18:12:00,8605, If I'm still half as good as my dad at his age I'll be in good shape.
487881,TJQ,2010-07-23 21:22:00,7806,Ouch.....
487884,misfish,2010-07-23 21:35:00,29133,"  You got that right Mike.Oh the stories that could be told,but me pop reads this board now and then."
487892,Big Cliff,2010-07-23 22:12:00,6899,Be glad you still have him with you!   I'd be giving anything to have mine with me today!
487897,Guest LivingLegend,2010-07-23 22:25:00,0,looks like bad luck can happen in double digits............
487902,Jewelbee,2010-07-23 22:47:00,422,OMG.............
487916,spincast,2010-07-23 23:49:00,3279,Hey Solo: I hope I can have that relationship with my son when its that time for me! Good on both of you for that level .  Assuming of course he pays for the motor repairs
