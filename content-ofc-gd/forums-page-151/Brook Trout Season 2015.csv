It includes some funny video and release shots that normally don't make the cut. All the fish were caught and released while fly fishing. Most of the fly fishing on the Nipigon is done using streamers with heavy sink tips to get down in the current, but this year we had some success with dry flies. Can't beat a take on the surface. Got my personal best brook trout this year also. Measured just over 25"" with a 17"" girth and weighed 8.5 lbs. This fall I ran into Moosbunk at one of the popular spots and the fish were colouring up for their spawning as shown in the photo below. Also had to post one of my signature ""pop-out"" photos. 2015 Video Trailer"

Congrats on that tank PB, and even bigger congrats if you nabbed it on the fly.  Nice to know such fish swim, even on small fish years.  Wouldn't be a trip up there without bumping into you at least once or twice.  Great little vid, may bump into you next year, never know. Good luck in 2016."
