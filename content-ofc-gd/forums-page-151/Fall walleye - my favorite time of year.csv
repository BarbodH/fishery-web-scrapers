943025,mr blizzard,2015-11-02 13:58:00,1589,"Well done, have not caught one in 4 years up here, maybe I should put my boat away more often, lol great times esp with the kids"
943044,Sinker,2015-11-02 16:39:00,8692,"Its funny, I live within 30 mins of about 10 of these spots, and have never tried it at night in the fall. I'm missing out apparently. If you ever want company, let me know! My son would enjoy this too I bet. Good stuff!!  S."
943045,Dutch01,2015-11-02 16:44:00,1431,"A couple of people have made comments like they might actually know these spots :[  If you PM me where you think it is and you're right, I'll confirm and maybe we can go one night.  How old is your Son?"
943046,Sinker,2015-11-02 16:47:00,8692,"My son is 13. Pm sent. I might not know the exact spot, but I bet I'm close  S."
943051,Dutch01,2015-11-02 17:22:00,1431,PM replied.  Let me know if/when you're headed up. Maybe we can meet up.
943086,chris.brock,2015-11-02 21:58:00,4053,"PM replied.  Let me know if/when you're headed up. Maybe we can meet up.  If you and Shane are fishing Saturday or Sunday night shift, it would give me a good excuse to get out for a couple hours, if it's the spot I'm thinking of"
943087,Dutch01,2015-11-02 22:02:00,1431," I have one spot I have to hold back because I promised to and that's how I got it in the first place! I'm there tomorrow.  I gave Shayne two spots, one is popular and not a huge secret but does have fish. The other is one I've never tried but have wanted to. It's possible I'd head to one of them on Saturday."
942922,Dutch01,2015-11-01 19:29:00,1431,"I know, I know, a   thread from Dutch?  Who would have thought.....  I just created a photobucket account and have to experiment on you guys!  Seriously, though.  I love this time of year!  My boat is new (to me) and I don't have a survival suit, so I put her to bed for winter:    Luckily, I don't need a boat to catch walleye this time of year  DISCLAIMER: I am very aware of regs, and would never break them.  Instead of explaining if every picture of fish or a stringer was legal, let me say right now YES.   We had some very slow days to start off but I think we were just over-eager and started too early.  They've really been ""on"" lately - except for last night but that's another story   The ""supermoon"" over my favorite lake:     The fish we caught early on were fairly skinny. You'll see a difference in some of the later fish.        A true (one man) double header.  This blew my mind, I was using a pickerel rig and fighting in a fish.  Suddenly there was a big weight, but no real fight anymore. I shined my light and I thought there was a walleye following the fish I was fighting (it all happened so fast).  When it was all over, I could not believe what I saw in the net!       We get fish like this all the time:      That's my bro in law.  Our kids are now 12 and love to come with us, even at night, in the cold, in the rain etc they're loving it.  The smiles are priceless!  Nephew with a huge smile (some spot hiding necessary!):     My Son caught a whopper last weekend! A true five-pounder, trust me the picture does not do it justice!  He caught 9 of our total 23 fish for the night, and hasn't let me live it down since    It was so worth the razzing though, he asks me every other day when I can take him again  It's nice that there's a place to make a fire, this time of year it really makes a difference.  Luckily I get free junk pallets from work so I have all the firewood I need, I just have to carry it out there.  Which sucks.  But whatever!     It's 98% walleye at my spots but occasionally we get an outlier (sorry for the focus, night pics aren't always easy to take):      Sunday two weeks ago, and Saturday last weekend were two of the best days I've had in a while.  Due to darkness and weather (and the fact the fish didn't stop biting), we didn't take pics of each fish, but this will give you an idea of how they are fattening up!  This is what we kept Sunday two weeks ago (many more were released).  Note the giant Musky bite on the one walleye!  I missed it in the dark until I got home.  I would have let him go if I'd seen it.  The fillet's were pretty chewed up and gross.     And this was last Saturday in the crazy wind and driving rain.  It was a wild night!     Last night, I was sure they'd be on.  Famous last words.  I got a 19"" at my first spot, and a 12"" at my second.  Sloooooow.....  It's been a great fall already and I still have two weeks until close at my spots.  Someone told me yesterday about a shore spot on Quinte, so I may just extend my season after Nov. 15!  I've never shore fished Quinte so I might post on the board when I'm headed and see who will be in the area.    Good luck out there guys.  Dutch"
942924,leaf4,2015-11-01 19:41:00,2466,Nice report and sweet fish you're slaying them!
942925,davey buoy,2015-11-01 19:49:00,5505,"Looks like a lot of fun,some good eating there.Nice when the kids want to go !!!!!! Thanks for posting.!"
942928,2 tone z71,2015-11-01 20:07:00,1311,"Looks like a nice pile of gold ya got there,a nice fall snack too"
942934,wkrp,2015-11-01 20:34:00,656,"Good stuff, but do you ever fish in daylight?"
942936,Dutch01,2015-11-01 21:02:00,1431,"Good stuff, but do you ever fish in daylight?  I do not!  Well, rarely anyways.  I have to once in a while so people don't start thinking I'm a vampire"
942937,misfish,2015-11-01 21:24:00,29133,Reeling them in. Nice Dutch.
942938,KraTToR,2015-11-01 21:25:00,506,Hey you snuck a bass in there!!  Some nice eating Dore you had there... Its been a while since I've had a nice feed of walleye...
942940,fishnsled,2015-11-01 21:47:00,3520,That's some good fishing!  Nice to have a few for the table as well  Good stuff!
942944,Dutch01,2015-11-01 22:12:00,1431,Thanks all. I'll be back out there again Tuesday night. I can't wait!
942963,Joeytier,2015-11-01 23:07:00,3990,You've got some great shore fishing destinations.  A lot of great fish in those pics congrats!  My shore spots tend to cool off in the fall but the burbot should be picking up soon...do you ever get those?
942966,Dutch01,2015-11-01 23:21:00,1431,"No, I don't even know if there's burbot in these lakes.  My fav spot tends to have bigger fish in the fall than spring, and less fishermen to boot."
942968,Gallie,2015-11-01 23:29:00,1215,Mmmm tasty dinners right there nice work!
942977,solopaddler,2015-11-02 00:19:00,8605,Wow that's pretty darned impressive! Well done!
942982,mike rousseau,2015-11-02 00:49:00,4661,Nice job...  Those first 3 walleye pice the fish look really skinny...
942983,manitoubass2,2015-11-02 00:52:00,11391,Wicked!!!!  Boy are those first 3 ever skinny!  Great pics looks like a fun spot!!!
942984,manitoubass2,2015-11-02 00:53:00,11391,Wicked!!!!  Boy are those first 3 ever skinny!  Great pics looks like a fun spot!!!  What kind of weight are you using on those pickeral rigs?
942986,chris.brock,2015-11-02 01:06:00,4053,"I've noticed that too there, early fall they are skinny, now until the 15th they are chunky.  Looks like you've got them figured out Dutch, nice! Makes me wish I was fishing night shift eyes right now."
942989,Dutch01,2015-11-02 01:15:00,1431,"Shoot, I wish I could be there every night!. The gas bill is killing me  though (it's 90 minutes each way)!"
942991,Dutch01,2015-11-02 01:20:00,1431,"It depends on which spot I'm at. If low current, 3/8 to 5/8, if more current then 5/8 to 3/4.  Truth be told most of those fish were caught on a red Gamakatsu octopus hook, split shot and minnow under a float.  One of my spots has a pier and I'll take the float off and ""walk the dog"" up and down too.  I don't use anything other than minnows this time of year."
942993,James77,2015-11-02 01:34:00,175,"Great fish, it's a real treat to get those consistently!"
943007,4x4bassin,2015-11-02 06:59:00,1025,Well done Dutch .
943019,Rod Caster,2015-11-02 13:04:00,5784,"wow, what a shore spot!"
943021,NANUK,2015-11-02 13:29:00,797,Nice haul !! Who needs a boat eh
943023,Headhunter,2015-11-02 13:48:00,5703,Nicely done! I would have felt sorry for those skinny Pickereyes! Might be inclined to give them a marshmallow and send them on their way! LOL Nice shootin! HH
