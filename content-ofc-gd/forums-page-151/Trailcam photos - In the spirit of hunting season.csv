942971,Rod Caster,2015-11-01 23:39:00,5784,"Thanks all! I spend so much time in the bush here; it's funny how the forest sometimes seems empty of animals, but clearly it's teaming with wildlife.  Here are some recent shots. 10 pointer!        "
942978,Nipfisher,2015-11-02 00:20:00,2449,You have me PUMPED!
942979,Joeytier,2015-11-02 00:25:00,3990,Hopefully they're not only active at night this week!
941972,Rod Caster,2015-10-27 13:57:00,5784,Deer (riffle) season is almost here!  This is what I'm seeing on my camera. The bucks seem to be moving now that it's colder and the rut is on it's way.                  
941973,Joeytier,2015-10-27 14:03:00,3990,"Hope one of you guys can drop that buck!  What a beauty (montser bull too, wow)"
941974,Dara,2015-10-27 14:09:00,3052,Thats a pretty busy spot you got there
941977,NAW,2015-10-27 14:16:00,4022,Go Get em!!  I can't wait to get back in to deer hunting!  Once my boy is old enough to sit still in a ground blind.  I give it 2 more seasons on the bench for me..
941978,BillM,2015-10-27 14:31:00,17367,First weekend of Nov can't come soon enough!  Buddy has been seeing lots and lots of rubs around his place.  The boys are getting excited
941981,wormdunker,2015-10-27 14:40:00,1711,Those pix are awesome!  Lots of activity in your area.  Thanx
941982,captpierre,2015-10-27 14:42:00,2521,Hey. You must live in a zoo. Nice shots
941983,Beavertail,2015-10-27 14:44:00,331,"Very cool! When you're in your stand or blind and hear foot steps coming through the brush, you just don't know what it's gonna be!! Sure keeps things interesting. If all goes as planned looks like you could be in for a good season."
941991,chris.brock,2015-10-27 15:58:00,4053,Looks like a pretty busy corridor you're set up on there Chad. It won't be long now.
941992,AKRISONER,2015-10-27 16:01:00,5558,are those fishers?
941995,Rod Caster,2015-10-27 16:25:00,5784,"Live in a zoo hahahah.  Yeah, the variety is awesome here!  I believe those are Pine Martens. Someone here might be able to confirm that?"
942000,Joeytier,2015-10-27 17:11:00,3990,Pine martens.  Fishers are much larger
942009,LucG,2015-10-27 18:01:00,779,"Definitely a fisher Chad. Pine marten are usually much smaller, and have much lighter colors. Looks like a smaller female. As Joey mentioned, male fishers can get quite large. Nice pics!"
942018,Rod Caster,2015-10-27 19:42:00,5784,Great info thanks Luc!
942022,misfish,2015-10-27 20:00:00,29133,Just the spot I have been looking for Chad. Now to get my stand up there.LOL  Good luck with the hunt and some great captures.

942044,manitoubass2,2015-10-27 21:31:00,11391,Nice shots chad!!!  I was gonna mention something else but ill bit my tongue...
942046,mukluk,2015-10-27 21:48:00,196,"Just one problem.  The ""yote"" in the first picture is looking up at your tree stand.  He's going to tell every one to stay clear.  Nice clear pictures.  Thanks for sharing."
