942988,Whopper,2015-11-02 01:10:00,2174,Where in the world have you been hiding?   Congrats to the angler on a great fish!
943000,irishfield,2015-11-02 03:00:00,26272,Yah I was going to say Jamie's been AWOL for some time!
939527,landry,2015-10-14 02:15:00,1005,There may be bigger caught but it is a VERY big Muskie and it's rude and petty to undermine someone's accomplishment.
939532,Sinker,2015-10-14 02:44:00,8692,My thoughts exactly. Jealousy does funny things to people.  S.
939534,Old Ironmaker,2015-10-14 03:01:00,8243,"It always seems to be a problem posting or recording a record fish or a very large fish. As soon as it happens people begin to doubt it. '""Look ay the way the fish is held, it must be Photoshopped"" and a lot of other nay saying, that's why some choose to keep it to themselves. If someone says they caught a big fish one's word isn't enough, show me is what some people say, here on OFC.  That is a wonderful catch and I envy her for the excitement she must have experienced."
939543,mike rousseau,2015-10-14 03:48:00,4661,It's definatley a very big musky  I'm on a world class fishery and she just beat my personal PB...
939641,steverowbotham,2015-10-14 18:34:00,1800,Christine is legit too.  I've spent time on the water with her and she is better than most anglers I've fished with.  Great fish!
939647,JustinHoffman,2015-10-14 19:11:00,482,"Tell me about it, Steve! She kicks my butt with the largies 90% of the time, haha!"
939658,fishdawg,2015-10-14 20:51:00,912,Yep definitely not Christine's first day at the office. She logs lots of hours on many different water ways all over the province. Great fish Chris! Congratulations again.
939675,Steve,2015-10-14 22:35:00,2075,"also, she serves our country, and is in better shape than 90% of us on this thread (in relation to her ability to hold a fish like that).  again - huge fish!"
939787,mikeh,2015-10-15 12:41:00,824,"huge fish and a great picture to boot, thanks for posting Justin"
939804,PUMP KNOWS,2015-10-15 14:32:00,937,"Wow, thats a beast and a half!"
939847,esoxansteel,2015-10-15 19:46:00,1307,"A wold class muskie in any body of water, and a clean spottie to boot, congrads"
939849,jimmer,2015-10-15 19:55:00,2730,So jealous! I've been looking for one of those all my life!
939858,mistaredone,2015-10-15 20:44:00,913,Crazy awesome fish!!!!  Great pic too. Props on the smile and hold. She has more steel than me lol
939864,irishfield,2015-10-15 21:28:00,26272,"The first time I saw the pic on FB I thought it was photoshopped... as I know I certainly couldn't hold my 53.5 out like that a few years back. Then I saw another photo and no doubt it was the real deal. A GREAT fish. Hoping I can find something similar in the month+ to come, while cruising the Severn Sound."
939888,Sinker,2015-10-16 00:35:00,8692,"Oh its the real deal. I was texting them the whole day they were out there. Christine is quite the angler. She would kick most guys asses easy, mine included.....at fishing too!  S."
939891,chris.brock,2015-10-16 00:53:00,4053,"Giant ski! The head looks like a watermelon.  Just curious, so what's Christine's story? Probably heard her name before but I didn't take note. She seems to know everybody. Does she have a blog or website?  If I get one half the weight this weekend I will be ecstatic."
939904,JustinHoffman,2015-10-16 02:37:00,482,"Chris Brock - Christine was a fixture on the Fish-Hawk forums for many years. She is also a member of the Reelbuddies board. That is how she knows a bunch of the guys, as she would go on many of the group trips and events - and fishes with many of the members regularly. A few of the pics I have taken of her have been published in OOD magazine, also.  An extremely accomplished multi-species angler....that like I said, generally out fishes me! haha.  Cheers, Justin"
939907,chris.brock,2015-10-16 02:51:00,4053," Very cool, crazy expertise here on OFC, gotta love it!"
939977,Spiel,2015-10-16 18:47:00,9065,  Outstanding!
939985,jimmer,2015-10-16 20:14:00,2730,I wish my wife was into the fishing scene like her!
940029,Sinker,2015-10-16 23:09:00,8692,"My gf loves to fish, and I love to go with her. We are a great team.  BUT...now I can't go without her LOL  Its all good though.  She can out fish most of my buddies, and kicks my butt all the time!  S."
940101,GbayGiant,2015-10-17 15:10:00,1780,Everyone does better with a women in their boat!  Known fact Shane!  
940126,i2cool2fool,2015-10-17 16:33:00,349,Impressive catch!
940396,Jigger,2015-10-18 17:07:00,1237,That fish is ridiculous.
942838,Crazyhook,2015-11-01 03:41:00,1154,Christine is a great person and am so happy she got to smile with this great fish
939305,JustinHoffman,2015-10-13 01:46:00,482,"Hello All,Some may have heard, but my good friend Christine Cope landed a monster 55"" muskie this past Saturday while fishing Lake St. Clair. Not only is this fish long, but it is fat and such a clean-looking specimen.I put together a short write-up detailing the catch after talking with Christine yesterday. You can find it here:http://www.wideopenspaces.com/female-angler-lands-monster-55-inch-lake-st-clair-muskie-pics/Good Fishing,Justin"
939306,2 tone z71,2015-10-13 01:51:00,1311,Omg what a gorgeous Muskie ..congrats to her
939307,Gallie,2015-10-13 01:52:00,1215,"Wow, awesome fish"
939310,206,2015-10-13 01:58:00,563,"Wow can't wait to show my daughter, that'll knock her down a notch lol  That's a beauty!!"
939311,Steve,2015-10-13 02:01:00,2075,Christine is a rock star!!! A well deserved fish for Chris.
939312,Henricus,2015-10-13 02:05:00,118,Congratulations on an awesome fish and experience!
939316,Whopper,2015-10-13 02:38:00,2174,Great looking fish!! Congrats to the angler
939320,leaf4,2015-10-13 03:03:00,2466,"Wowowow, beauty fish to boot look at those spots!"
939335,Joey,2015-10-13 07:05:00,9122,"Hmmm, Envious    what a monster, congrats to her!!!!"
939356,OhioFisherman,2015-10-13 12:41:00,6623,"Dang! Great fish!  "" They were marking shad in the area, ""  On Lake Erie here if you are marking shad or seeing them? You stand a decent chance of snagging one! Shad that is! LOL"
939370,mike rousseau,2015-10-13 13:29:00,4661,"I'm impressed with the hold she's doing!!!  Most men in my boat can't hold a fish that well for a picture...  And if you haven't been lucky enough to hold a fish like this go fill a 5 gallon pail with water then hold it away from you body... For 20-30 seconds... With a smile on your face!!!  unless your Lew...  Then think to yourself... ""Her fish was heavier""..."
939373,mr blizzard,2015-10-13 13:37:00,1589,Great job congrats
939381,Beavertail,2015-10-13 13:55:00,331,What a beast...its got a head like an American Alligator.
939392,captpierre,2015-10-13 14:21:00,2521,Monster beauti!
939395,Moosebunk,2015-10-13 14:30:00,3970,"I'm impressed with the hold she's doing!!!  Most men in my boat can't hold a fish that well for a picture...  Christine is and has been tougher than most men, all her life.  She's straining to hold this fish and crack that smile though, I can tell.  This might possibly be the best St. Clair fish I've laid eyes on and Justin's right to get excited for her.  She's just an awesome angler and person all around.  Congrats again Chris."
939456,outllaw,2015-10-13 19:44:00,1232,a nice fish from st clair. not a monster but a nice fish.
939465,landry,2015-10-13 20:07:00,1005,Outlaw - what are you talking about? Give me a break. What an untimely post.
939466,Rich Clemens,2015-10-13 20:07:00,3131,That's the fish dreams are made of.
939478,Brettiop,2015-10-13 20:42:00,279,a nice fish from st clair. not a monster but a nice fish.  How many st clair fish have you seen bigger then this?  If this isn't a monster then i guess St clair isn't capable of producing one...
939482,Sinker,2015-10-13 20:56:00,8692, You have pics or proof of something bigger or comparable? You should have left it at nice fish.  S.
939489,JustinHoffman,2015-10-13 22:06:00,482,"Hello All,  Just wanted to say that I passed along this thread to Christine and she was very appreciative of all the kind comments and well wishes.  As for your comment, 'outlaw' - I will leave you with this. After doing a bit of research, a 56"" fish (girth of 26"") caught in 2009 was deemed the largest muskie ever taken from the lake according to records kept by the Michigan-Ontario muskie club. If a bigger fish has come from those waters since then, it is unknown. If not, Christine's fish would be the second largest ever caught from St. Clair.  Would I deem that a monster? A trophy? A giant? I'd say yes to all three.  But that's just me.  Good fishing to all...  Justin"
939495,outllaw,2015-10-13 22:54:00,1232,"boys you take this toooo serious lol. beauty fish. monster,, . .I'm not worthy. I bow to the musky gods. remember its supposed to be fun."
939504,Rizzo,2015-10-14 00:15:00,4754,Great Caesar's ghost what a fish! Nicely done. Probably tasted like an old boot though.
939506,mike rousseau,2015-10-14 00:29:00,4661,"Plenty of big fish are never heard about  I know a bunch of guys that have broken the Ontario carp record... Lol  And this is a great fish but I'm sure there has been bigger or at least longer caught this year... Actually I'm sure I saw a pic of a 56.5"" just the other day..."
939509,manitoubass2,2015-10-14 00:37:00,11391,Ill take it for ahat it is  A monster fish landed by an angler?  Wicked catch on ANY body of water that holds skis
