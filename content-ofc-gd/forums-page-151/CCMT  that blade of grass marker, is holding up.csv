Brian I have a crystsal ball and today I asked it, ""where can I go to grease Brian out of his drift""...And it worked  The fishing was only tough if you didn't have the secret bait or the secret lure  Great to share a drift with you again"

I brought out the fly rod today along with the pin. Nothing like trying to throw a fly and it comes right back and smacks ya in the face. Wind was brutal today."

We city boys had no problems landing them after a good Mcdonald's feast for lunch  For the stretch we fished today, we were mostly sheltered and drifting/casting wasn't too bad...You gotta learn how to spey cast!"
942976,ccmtcanada,2015-11-02 00:13:00,7971,I'll be hitting the creeks tomorrow morning.  Hopefully I get one or two...
943002,frozen-fire,2015-11-02 03:19:00,542,  Us city boys can land some fish after a bit of food in the tummy.  Nice seeing you Brian.
