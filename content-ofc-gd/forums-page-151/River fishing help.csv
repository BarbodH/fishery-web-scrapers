Ive got waders for us both and want to take my 12 year old son who hates sports and needs to find an activity that doesn't involve a video screen. Fishing in the boat is great as long as hes on fish in 10 min otherwise he's bored and wondering when we are leaving otherwise hes on my phone playing games in the boat. Any suggestions as to where we can find some fish in a trib. not too far from TO. would be great! I promise not to share and put everything back. The only thing we take is usually some trash if we find any. Thanks in advance Sheldon"
