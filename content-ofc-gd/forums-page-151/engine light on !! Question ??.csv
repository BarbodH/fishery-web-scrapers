942743,fishindevil,2015-10-31 20:38:00,6254,A quick question for the car guys in the know a 2006 Chrysler Sebring 2.7 litre engine  needed a litre of oil and it's 5w 20 and it was just above the add line poured in a litre of oil and almost immediately the engine light came on checked the oil again and it's showing just a little bit above the max line could that be enough to set the engine light on ?? It's maybe a 1/8 inch to a quarter inch over the line just wondering if that would cause any problems  thanks
942745,Freshtrax,2015-10-31 20:45:00,2215,I would hazard a guess that the excess oil may be sucking through the PCV and is messing up one of the emission sensors.    Is oil pressure within spec?  Why is is loosing a L of oil in between oil changes.?   That's concerning.
942746,Old Man,2015-10-31 20:46:00,822,"I suspect the oil level and engine light is just a coincidence. You have another issue, ie. malfunctioning O2 sensor, ignition issue etc. etc. Can be one of a 1000 parameters tracked by your cars power train control module. Only way to know for sure what it is, is to dump the codes. Either buy a OBDII code reader or take it in to get them read."

942810,Joeytier,2015-10-31 23:56:00,3990,Invest in a code reader!
942813,mike rousseau,2015-11-01 00:13:00,4661,Yup  Get a code reader... Got one a few years ago and it's saved me and my friends and family thousands...

942833,SBCregal,2015-11-01 02:39:00,688,"you can  pick up a bluetooth obdII adapter on amazon for about 20 bucks shipped.  if you have a smartphone you can download a free app to read the codes.  you can pull most codes with that combination, as well as a few other neat features.  the code number and google will get you a whole bunch of info and tips."
942861,fishindevil,2015-11-01 12:36:00,6254,Wow awesome guys thanks !!! I will check it out and see if I can get a code from it
942863,fishindevil,2015-11-01 12:42:00,6254,It's showing P0420 code ??
942864,lew,2015-11-01 12:47:00,12766,It's showing P0420 code ??  A quick GOOGLE check brought this up Shaun.  https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCUQFjACahUKEwjt4ObZoO_IAhXG_R4KHROmAsw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.obd-codes.com%2Fp0420&usg=AFQjCNHd7t8ZMIKonkCe1ZPS3hklrOz-9g
942867,fishindevil,2015-11-01 12:55:00,6254,Seems it could be upstream o2 sensor or downstream o2 sensor or inefficient CAT

942923,bigbuck,2015-11-01 19:39:00,2449,"That usually means the catalytic convertor is toast. You are burning oil and that is murder on the cat. Mechanics have a saying...'catalytics dont die, they get murdered'. Something caused it to die, you need to figure it out before replacing it."
942930,fishindevil,2015-11-01 20:12:00,6254,Well thanks for all the information and links and YouTube vids she was able to take the car in this morning to Canadian tire and diagnosis was made and car on the hoist everything checked out ok it seems it was about almost 1 litre overfilled with oil they measured the oil as it came out and checked it on the computer and refilled it to the exact level and the light went off and everything seems perfect and good to go she is happy and I am as well she said to say thanks to everyone for all the help !!!! Cheers ?✌️?Thanks
942932,fishindevil,2015-11-01 20:13:00,6254,They also added some fuel injection cleaner and said it could have even been some bad gas !!!! Hmmmm that one code can mean a lot of things as well at least it wasn't a bad cat as that would have been $$$$$$$$
943052,Freshtrax,2015-11-02 17:28:00,2215,Fairly confident oil was being sucked through the PCV and messing  up the readings. .   Glad it all worked out.    You still need to figure out why there was a litre of oil missing in the first place.
943056,AKRISONER,2015-11-02 17:45:00,5558,"guys, dont overfill your oil, it puts a pile of pressure on your seals...you are better off running a little below the max line than over.  When you overfill your oil, you get oil blowing through the seals and into combustion...which is not good on all accounts.  You can actually severely damage your car doing this."
