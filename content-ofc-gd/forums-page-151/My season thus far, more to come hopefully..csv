Got a few good pike outings in the early spring, and caught my first muskie back in August! Didn't really get out for bass until two trips in September. I also went down to Hilton Head with my family back in April where we caught a bunch of Bonnethead Sharks and Red Drums. I have a trip to Costa Rica coming up in late November, hopefully we'll be able to get out for some deep sea fishing.          "

943105,Locnar,2015-11-03 00:31:00,645,"I don't really have an itinerary for the trip, just heading down with the family. Boat loads of beer is on the list. Anything you recommend?"

Rent an SUV for the week, split the cost with the others, it's a safe place to wander, and lots of cool stuff to see off the beaten path, the west coast, around Mal Pais, a magical place, can't wait to go back there"
