Great news for outfitters and hunters!  https://news.ontario.ca/mnr/en/2015/10/ontario-proposing-to-expand-black-bear-hunting-pilot.html

The only line I'm a bit wary of is this...""Baiting of bears during all bear hunting seasons would be regulated to help address possible public safety concerns."" Not sure what that means exactly so we'll have to wait and see on that one.  Cheers"

942655,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-31 02:06:00,10439,Good!!!
942676,Rod Caster,2015-10-31 13:31:00,5784,"yeah! Next step maybe will help tourism in N.Ont and allow non-residents to hunt spring bear.  I didn't hunt as much as I wanted to, but I really enjoyed the Spring and Fall bear hunt!"
