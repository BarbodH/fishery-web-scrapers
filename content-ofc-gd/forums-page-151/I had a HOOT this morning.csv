942951,misfish,2015-11-01 22:46:00,29133,"This morning was a HOOT.  I am always getting to my fishing spots way before light. I like to get all set and ready.  Coffee and a toasted bagel to get my belly ready for the mornings event.  This morning was a bit different. As I was getting my waders on and getting the gear ready, there was a couple of owls hooting away. Total darkness and listening to them chatter about was so cool to listen too. I listened for a bit then well,,,,,,,,,,,,,  I thought what the hell, put the camera on the back of the truck, press record, and try to chat with them.  It didnt take much to carry on a conversation with them. There was one to my right a fair distance away on the other side of the river. He seemed to be the one that wanted to chat the most. There was one to my right that joined in. He would hoot a bit and fly. I could hear him launch from tree to tree as his wings made a loud noise.( couldnt pick that up on the recording saddly) Is was a pretty cool experince.  Turn up the volume a bit. Sorry  for my bad hoot calls, but they seemed to work.  "

943085,misfish,2015-11-02 21:56:00,29133,"Great Horned Owl   Thanks Dozer  I wonder if these owls will stay put once day light comes? If so, and I can  pin point the direction of the  calls in the dark, I could find one to take some pics. The trees are getting baron. Would they stand out?  Edit to add  I did notice the calling stopped just aspartial daylight had started."
