And I normally just head out to where all the other boats are, and start my hunt from there.  Just wondering if anyone has been out this fall, and if they are getting any decent hauls..?  It's a bit of a pain now that we have to pay for parking, and even though Midhurst might as well be Barrie, I still have to pay!"

If you launch the yak at hooters, you will be fine. No paying on weekends.  I know that the shinners are in full blown. Been stopping by the marina every morning to watch them flip and flop on the surface.  I have even tried chucking some big jerk baits for monster pike, but no luck yet."
