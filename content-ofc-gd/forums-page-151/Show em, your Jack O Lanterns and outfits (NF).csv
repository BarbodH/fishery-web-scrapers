Me and my good friend next door neighbor set up the front yard. We have eerie music blasting, flood lights shooting back to the sidewalk so people can't see what's back there.    Chiminea burning and drinks in the back.    With little kids we take off our masks and be nice, with older kids we are merciless, no speaking,  jumping out of bushes, grabbing ankles while hidden in a pile of leaves, throwing cherry bombs in the chiminea etc    Love it! Neighbor bonding, fun, and no rain."

Yes, we showed no mercy with the older kids.  Kids stopped coming to our door for a few years. Some vague rumour about an axe wielding psycho?????"
