How could we ask for anything else in November? Mainly targeted bass and we boated about 20 of them. Mostly largemouth and all between a pound or two. They seemed to like the white twister tail, but also caught some on a drop shot with a gulp leech. Tried deeper water with the drop shot for smallies and caught a few, then got this surprise out of 25' of water. Let it go, even though they are open all year in this lake. "
