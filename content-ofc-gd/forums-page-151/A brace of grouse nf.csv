942689,kickingfrog,2015-10-31 14:53:00,8333,Busy times lately but I made it out Friday for a hunt. Saw more and flushed more driving than I did walking but did manage 2 birds. My brother went out earlier in the week before the storm and got his limit for the first time in at least 15 years he figures.  Numbers seem to be up this year.  
942690,Acountdeleted,2015-10-31 14:56:00,2562,Mmmmm. Grouse. Well done.
942691,Beavertail,2015-10-31 15:03:00,331,Nice going. Good to hear that numbers are up in your area.
942711,Fisherman,2015-10-31 16:54:00,7201,"Very nice,  we definitely have more around our area this year.  Hopefully they have an easy winter and increase their numbers."
942727,Rod Caster,2015-10-31 19:02:00,5784,I regularly see 12 in a day. Good numbers here too.  Love the look of that gun
942731,Joeytier,2015-10-31 19:32:00,3990,Beautiful shotgun.  What is that?
942732,alexmedic,2015-10-31 19:33:00,186,"I was at my old faithful spot today and didn't even get a flush. Funny how it works.  I was there last week, bagged 3 and flushed out 10."
942737,kickingfrog,2015-10-31 20:12:00,8333,Beautiful shotgun.  What is that?  CZ Mallard in 20 gauge. Second season using it.
942750,captpierre,2015-10-31 21:00:00,2521,Tough couple of winters. Glad to hear of good numbers.
942775,Sinker,2015-10-31 22:06:00,8692,Good stuff! Been seeing lots in my area too. I need to go for a walk with the gun!
942831,manitoubass2,2015-11-01 02:34:00,11391,Lots up here too. Seem to go in cycles.  Beauty 20 gauge!  I prefer a 20 over a 4/10 or 12  for birds
943138,pics,2015-11-03 06:56:00,1268,My old Stevens 410 got quite the workout at moose camp.. lots of birds around Nipigon this year.. too bad there were no moose
943171,Sterling,2015-11-03 18:06:00,477,"I was talking to some MNR guys here and they say partridge populations work on a 7 year cycle, where every ~7 years there's a huge upswing in population due to the number of offspring or whatever. Can't exactly remember the details.  Everybody seems to be reporting great numbers for partridge. I even saw my very first partridge EVER at my place. Funny story but the silly thing actually flew into my window and killed itself.      "
