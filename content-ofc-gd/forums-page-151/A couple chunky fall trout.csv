The trout seem to be doing well, as these two were bigger than anything I've ever caught here previously.  My lucky strike Ford spoon struck again...amazing these don't get used more by lake trout anglers as I've had some incredible success with these spoons!      ...Then the torrential rains showed up again and that was it for me.  Surprisingly warm forecast for the next week or so they may be one more trip in the boat this year yet!"

943018,Rod Caster,2015-11-02 12:59:00,5784,endless rain is not a joke. My trails are slop after an otherwise dry year.  Those are beauts for sure! Big for your 'average' lake trout that's for certain.
