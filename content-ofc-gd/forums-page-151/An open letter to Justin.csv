943455,lew,2015-11-05 12:30:00,12766,I've always liked the idea of putting people in charge of ministries who actually know something about them and having a combat veteran as Minister of Defense sounds real good to me.  Never could understand having someone heading a department who knows nothing about it.

Quote from an article in the Mop and Pail...  ""Conservative MP Tony Clement, the former industry minister who cited privacy concerns when he cancelled the long-form census of 2011 and replaced it with a voluntary national household survey, said he would not criticize the Liberals for undoing his efforts. Mr. Clement told reporters on Thursday that the decision to bring in a voluntary census had been made “collectively” in 2010 by the Conservative government. In hindsight, he said, “I think I would have done it differently.” There may be better ways to capture data while protecting the privacy and security of people, said Mr. Clement: “I’ll take the blame for that – I should have posed that question six years ago.” End quote"" Is the Clemster maneuvering for a stab at the big chair of the CCP"

The most common version of the story is that the CIA had an operative give Marley a pair of boots as a gift, and the boots had a radioactive wire hidden in them, which caused the cancer on his toe.

We should constantly and continuously hold our politicians to a higher standard.  They are the custodians of OUR money and our services for our money.    Taxes will be low for all of us, if the politicians could ensure that governments and government agencies are run as efficiently and effectively as possible.  No wasting of money.  No excess head count or overly highly paid executives or employee groups.  If a party aligns its priorities with the majority of voters AND then executes on those promised priorities efficiently, then we have great government.  The provincial Liberals have NOT run an efficient government and have wasted money.  They will raise OUR  taxes to pay for THEIR incompetence, and then will take credit for reducing the deficit or managing the deficit.   Its crazy.  Anyone who voted Liberal last election CANNOT complain about any increase in power rates or taxes.  You gave up that right when you voted Liberal.  The ONLY thing that matters is efficient and effective government.  Taxes and fees will be as low as they can be if that happens.  But that won't happen in Ontario."

As of Sunday:  The price for off-peak hours goes up 0.3 cents to 8.3 cents/kWh. The price for mid-peak hours goes up 0.6 cents to 12.8 cents/kWh. The price for on-peak hours goes up 1.4 cents to 17.5 cents/kWh.  Sunday's rate hike means that the on-peak price of electricity has jumped 77 per cent since Smart Meters became common five years ago. In November 2010, the price was 9.9 cents/kWh.

943017,GbayGiant,2015-11-02 12:46:00,1780,"I'd take that photo down man.....stuff is still illegal. What is legal and what is illegal?  It's legal if you are sick and it has been prescribed to you.  It's illegal if you buy it from anything other than a high priced system the Cons tried to set. A 'new MMPR system' which handed the whole market over to the BM.(they'll never admit that) It replaced the MMAR which allowed patients to grow small amounts of their own medicine which was put in place back in 2001, by court order I might add. The MMAR was made legal under court injunction after the new MMPR system was put in place.  Health Canada threatened the sick with by sending the RCMP to their doors if they did not comply and jail. Another recent court order was that the sick can ingest their medicine rather than smoke it. Epileptic Children don't need to smoke their meds when they can take it other ways with no high what so ever. There is CBD as well but I wont get into all that. If you'd like to read more about this, its all over the WWW.  Take it or leave it..it's a choice most would like to have and a right they have been given by court order after the cons tried to get it away. They see money in this little plant and they don't want to let anyone control it other than themselves. It's the peoples plant after all and it will treat the ones badly who try and control it. It will work well for the ones who don't try.  cheers"
943071,John Bacon,2015-11-02 19:41:00,3277,What is legal and what is illegal?   Moonshine is illegal.  I am pretty sure that that is the phtoto that was being referenced.
943073,GbayGiant,2015-11-02 20:20:00,1780, Moonshine is illegal.  I am pretty sure that that is the phtoto that was being referenced. There were two pictures. One was inferred as Moonshine in the form of Maple syrup. The other was what appeared to be MJ.  Both must have been illegal to have been taken down.  It's kinda sad someone would actually post illegal moonshine on the site and pass it off as Maple Syrup. There is nothing legal about moonshine. Now MMJ on the other hand is legal here in Canada. To post illegal MMJ would be on that same line as well.  Funny how back words the ideals of some people are in this regard. More hypocritical from a lack of knowledge really.  cheers.

942845,Dutch01,2015-11-01 05:44:00,1431," He studied 5,000 subjects for 20 years.  His study found no increased cancer risk in light to moderate users.  Take his word for it:  ""We expected that we would find that a history of heavy marijuana use--more than 500 to 1,000 uses--would increase the risk of cancer from several years to decades after exposure to marijuana,"" explains physician Donald Tashkin of the University of California, Los Angeles, and lead researcher on the project. But looking at residents of Los Angeles County, the scientists found that even those who smoked more than 20,000 joints in their life did not have an increased risk of lung cancer.""  Even clearer on weed versus tobacco:  ""Regular smoking of marijuana by itself causes visible and microscopic injury to the large airways that is consistently associated with an increased likelihood of symptoms of chronic bronchitis that subside after cessation of use. On the other hand, habitual use of marijuana alone does not appear to lead to significant abnormalities in lung function when assessed either cross-sectionally or longitudinally, except for possible increases in lung volumes and modest increases in airway resistance of unclear clinical significance. Therefore, no clear link to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been established. Although marijuana smoke contains a number of carcinogens and cocarcinogens, findings from a limited number of well-designed epidemiological studies do not suggest an increased risk for the development of either lung or upper airway cancer from light or moderate use, although evidence is mixed concerning possible carcinogenic risks of heavy, long-term use. Although regular marijuana smoking leads to bronchial epithelial ciliary loss and impairs the microbicidal function of alveolar macrophages, evidence is inconclusive regarding possible associated risks for lower respiratory tract infection. Several case reports have implicated marijuana smoking as an etiologic factor in pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum and bullous lung disease, although evidence of a possible causal link from epidemiologic studies is lacking. In summary, the accumulated weight of evidence implies far lower risks for pulmonary complications of even regular heavy use of marijuana compared with the grave pulmonary consequences of tobacco.   Source: http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201212-127FR#.VjWgx1-s_CQ   I'm sorry, I mean no disrespect, but I'm going to take a professor of medicine at UCLA who specializes in studies on smoking and lung function as an authority on the subject."

Seen far too many guys get nasty on booze & want to fight everybody in the room but never saw it with anyone smoking marijuana.  It's always seem pretty darned hypocritical to me that you can legally buy all the booze you want but grass is illegal.  Makes perfect sense to me that you should be able to go into a store and buy it just like you can buy booze.
942869,fish_fishburn,2015-11-01 13:11:00,1311,"Thought I would share this. My brother had a dog (Alaskan Malamute) with a skin condition. Dry flakey patches and hot spots etc. That poor dog would scratch till he bled. The vet put him on 100.00 a bag food and steroids as well as other medication. Was costing my bro a lot of money and his wife was not to happy about the money he was dropping on his dog. The Vet wasn't sure what was wrong but was making good money off of him. When one thing didn't work try something else.  I suggested we give the dog small amounts of weed on his food and see what happens as I had read that cannabis works for pets as well. So we got some and carboxalated (sp)it in the oven and he started to add a small amount to the dogs food. It only took a few days and the scratching stopped, within a month his skin issues were gone. I have also read that if your dog is older and they develop arthritis that small amounts of cannabis will work wonders for that as well. Go figure. Must be the cannabinoids."

942877,GbayGiant,2015-11-01 13:58:00,1780,The truth is people.  There is a huge reason why this is being legalized here in Canada. Medical and recreational is only one little piece of the giant puzzle. This is a multi trillion dollar industry which anyone can do. That is the real problem behind this little green plant. There are lots of natural plants on this planet that see people killed every day in the name of money.  Time to wake up.

942879,GbayGiant,2015-11-01 14:02:00,1780,"It's not all about getting high...  Cannabis used for medicine, food, fuel, paper, rope, maps, bricks, oil, paint, furniture and much more. CANNABIS IS THE MOST VERSATILE, EFFICACIOUS PLANTON EARTH Go to the Index 'Efficacious' means effective, or productive as regards the desired effect. This is particularly concerned with cannabis biomass (explained soon). Cannabis is versatile because it has so many uses. It's uses can be traced back to thousands of years before Christ. PRODUCTS WHICH CAN BE MADE WITH OR FROM CANNABIS (for more details see below) medicine, fuel, paper, food, rope, maps, clothes, nets, lace, soap, sails, shoes, plastics, explosives, caulking, fiberboard, paint, sealant, methanol, gasoline, fibre for fuel, bricks, charcoal, auto bodies, packing mass, lubricants, oil for lighting, oil for fuel, oil for lights, animal food, furniture, mats, varnish, lotions, ointments, lacquer, salad dressings.... There are an estimated 50,000 commercial uses. Until about 100 years ago almost all the world's bibles maps, sails, clothes and books were made out of cannabis. Much of the world's population has survived by eating hemp seed, cooked into a porridge called 'gruel'. CANNABIS BIOMASS Biomass is the amount of plant material which can be converted to fuel, usually by gasification. Biomass is biologically produced material. Methanol is a biomass substance. Biomass can be converted into virtually any sort of energy. World production of biomass has been estimated at 146 billion tons a year. The thermochemical process which converts organic material to fuel is called pyrolysis. This consists of applying heat with little or no air. It can produce charcoal, gasses, acetone, methanol and other organic liquids known as pyrolitic fuel oil. When the biomass of cannabis is converted to fuel there are no harmful waste products (compare with radioactive sources of energy) and there is no environmental pollution (as with fossil fuels). The FCDA have produced their 'biomass equation' which shows that cannabis biomass is the most efficient (and potentially the cheapest and most reliable) way to produce energy. It is estimated that up to 90% of the energy produced by the use of fossil fuels could be produced from biomass. Hemp can be converted to methane, methanol or petrol. Br ridding ourselves of the pollution factories and the resulting sulphurous smogs which are released into the atmosphere we could dramatically reduce acid rain and begin the reverse the Greenhouse Effect. Henry Ford's first Model T was designed to run on a methanol petrol produced from hemp seeds. PAPER 75 to 90 percent of the paper used for books, maps, bibles, banknotes and newspapers, was made from hemp until about 1883. Hemp paper had been used since the first century AD, by the Chinese, and it was used in Europe since the 5th. Cannabis can be harvested in 3 to six months as compared with 30 or more years for trees. It can produce double or more fibre as wood chippings and requires no dangerous chemicals in the paper pulping processes. No chlorine is needed for bleaching and no deadly dioxins are thrown into the environment. Hemp paper will outlive even the best quality wood pulp paper or papyrus paper. FOOD Hemp seed is one of the easiest to produce and nutritious food crops on earth. For many centuries it was the staple food crop for most of the world. The oils produced from the seed contains the highest amount of essential fatty acids in the plant world. Hemp seed oil helped clear the human system of cholesterol. The seed itself can be ground to make a porridge - gruel - or baked into cakes or bread. Hemp seed is the single most complete food on the planet and can be grown quickly almost anywhere, yet the world is allowed to starve as a result of the often total prohibition of cannabis. During recent years, some countries, notably the Maldives, have given life sentences to people found with even three seeds, whilst in the Western world it is readily available for use as bird food and fishing bait. That alone reveals the real evil behind this senseless banning of foods BRICKS, PLANKS, PLASTICS Hemp is for replacing wooden materials. as it can be pressed into a variety of forms. It can be used to make furniture and beams, being stronger and more flexible than timber as well as more financially and environmentally beneficial. Isochanvre, produced in France, is a method of making a building material from the hurds of hemp, which sets into a very hard mineral state ideal for construction. Archaeologists have found a bridge in the South of France, over 1200 years old, made from a similar material. Several house have already been built from hemp bricks. Hemp can also be used to make plastics for pipes for plumbing etc and almost any item made from plastic at this time; however, the processes involved are far less polluting. As well as using hemp fuel for his Model T, Henry Ford used hemp plastics to build the body work. TEXTILES Approximately 90 percent of sails and most rigging, nets, rope, flags and sealant was made from cannabis until this century; even nappies and towels.. Even the sailors shoes and socks were produced from cannabis fibres. The original hard wearing Levi jeans were made from cannabis. In 1938 Popular Mechanics, a USA magazine, stated that hemp was the ""standard fibre of the world"". Clothes made from hemp are more durable yet softer than those made from cotton, a plant which requires much pesticide and fertilizer to grow. Of course the huge pharmaceutical companies who profit from these chemicals would suffer if hemp was re-introduced widely into the markets, which is one reason such a process may be slow. This profit is important to remember when examining the true reasons for the prohibition of cannabis. PAINT, VARNISH, LACQUER For hundreds of years hemp seed oil was used to make paints and varnishes. Some of the greatest works of art were created on canvas (incidentally a Dutch word meaning cannabis), including works of Rembrandt, Van Gogh etc. OIL FOR LIGHTING Until this century hemp seed oil was used to produce most of the light in the world. It burns with an even light and odes not produce the soot characteristic of modern oils. It can also be used as a lubricant.

This is done to assure that the quality of the information is sound because that information will be review and used by other scientists in furthering the research and knowledge within that field. The fact that the University of Washington author used (referenced) 21 separate studies in writing this gives it more credence than most of the non reference crap that is publish on the net nowadays,  My background in science is in biology and agriculture. I made my living as a plant breeder and through the years wrote and submitted many papers of my own to journals.

942832,GbayGiant,2015-11-01 02:34:00,1780,"There's Very Good News for the Lungs of Marijuana Smokers The news: Conventional wisdom generally says inhaling any kind of smoke is bad for your lungs, and, to that end, smoking marijuana is just as bad for your health as smoking tobacco cigarettes. However, according to data recently published in the journal Annals of the American Thoracic Society, inhaling one marijuana cigarette a day over 20 years is not associated with adverse changes in lung health. In the largest cross-sectional analysis study of its kind, researchers at Emory University in Atlanta found that cannabis exposure and inhalation were not associated with negative spirometry changes, just FEV1 (forced expiratory volume) declines or problems with small airways disease. Additionally, the researchers found that vaporizing marijuana users reported even fewer issues than those who inhaled combusted marijuana. In other words, unlike tobacco cigarettes and their well-documented highly negative effects on smokers' lungs, marijuana cigarettes cannot be said to have the same correlation. On top of that, the researchers concluded marijuana smoke exposure could be ""associated with some protective lung effects among long-term smokers of tobacco,"" reports NORML. However, the study found that inhaling marijuana smoke led to an increase in symptoms of bronchitis-like coughing, sore throat and shortness of breath. So, some risks are certainly still present, but they pale in comparison to the same risks when smoking tobacco cigarettes. ""In a large representative sample of U.S. adults, ongoing use of marijuana is associated with increased respiratory symptoms of bronchitis without a significant functional abnormality in spirometry, and cumulative marijuana use under 20 joint-years is not associated with significant effects on lung function,"" the study's authors concluded. ""The pattern of marijuana's effects seems to be distinctly different when compared to that of tobacco use."" Growing science: Previous studies have also shown marijuana to have health effects much different than generally expected, including its effects on pulmonary functions and similar studies on the effects of marijuana smoke on the lungs. Not only does this data show marijuana smoke isn't as dangerous as tobacco smoke, but that cannabis could potentially be an effective method of treatment for a number of medical issues, considering the myriad of potential uses. Already, many state have legalized marijuana in one form or another, though most have approved cannabis for medicinal use. And as the body of science behind marijuana's positive aspects grows, you can expect even more states to be jumping on board and legalizing. h/t reset.me"

942794,manitoubass2,2015-10-31 22:57:00,11391,"Im gonna go on abit of a rant here.  One of the reasons marijuana is so safe and effective is because of its make up of active ingredients.  Things found in nature most often produce checks and balances.  Cannabis contains somewhere around 80 active ingredients, including flavanoids.  Synthetic drugs, heroin for example, is a highly concentrated extract containing one ingredient  Same with other synthetics for the nost part(always some exceptions)  A good example to the effect/cause is antidepressive medications in the selective serotinin reuptake inhibitors class(SSRIs)  Because the neuro anatomy is wildly fluctuated between every human, the drug itself is highly unstable. Might help one person, kill ten, make things worse for 60, etc. Because there is no way to see the amount of neurotransmittors active in a human, you 100% cannot know what is causing depressive symptoms and the like.  Cannabis is much more effective because of its high amount of active ingredients(checks and balances) it binds to receptors signalling the brain to produce neurotransmittors of imblances within the persons neuroanatomy( it might raise dopamine and suppress serotonin, or vice versa, dependant on need)  So does it work 100% of the time in a positive way, absolutely not. But cannabis has WAY higher potential to be positively effective then other drugs for this very reason.  If you suffer back pain, and im your dr, and i say I can give you one of two medications.  A is effective 80% of the time(without major side effects)  B is effective 5% of the time but might kill you  What do you honestly choose?"

It does nothing to take into factor a high amount of issues before, during or after(such as hereditary disease, exposure to other inhalants, race etc)  3. The amount of tar from marijuana needs to be compared directly to cigaretters in a controlled manner. Ie.

942734,John Bacon,2015-10-31 19:39:00,3277,"I remember reading a comparison between Holland the USA a few years ago.  Marijuana use in both countries was similar; but the USA had a higher percentage of harder drug users.   The theory presented was that the dealers in Holland only sold marijuana while US dealers also sold harder drugs.  Since marijuana was legal in Holland, and harder drugs were not, the dealers would not want risk their legal business by selling illegal drugs.  In the USA where dealers were already breaking the law by selling marijuana they were more likely to also sell harder drugs.  The US dealers didn't have a legal business to risk.   Since the dealers in Holland were unlikely to sell harder drugs, pot users were less likely to graduate to other drugs.  The availability of a legal high to customers probably made them less likely to experiment with illegal drugs as well.  In Holland the customers are not taking a legal risk by using marijuana; however, they would be if they tried harder drugs.   In the USA the dealers are already taking a legal risk by selling marijuana.  Likewise users are also taking a legal risk by buying a using it.  There is not a lot of additional legal risk by graduating to harder drugs.   All of this resulting in fewer users from Holland graduating to harder drugs.   Hopefully, legalization in Canada can lead to lower usage of some other drugs. "

The thought of people getting behind the wheel of a car in that state scares the hell out of me. I'm all for medicanal use but not legalizing it for recreational use.   if you think for a second that people who felt like you did, get behind a wheel and drive...  How..  It does not happen like that but......  Maybe that person should have warned you that taking other peoples meds are not a good thing, not to mention, against the law!

942682,Acountdeleted,2015-10-31 14:10:00,2562,"Ok, so my full opinion on this.  When I was a teen (which wasn't super long ago). Everyone knew a guy. I'm talking like 14-15-16 years old. If you wanted to get marijuana it was easy. Everyone knew someone. I didn't think of it at the time but there was something scary about that. We would hear about pot laced with all sorts of different things. That's how it becomes a 'gateway drug'. Not because people want to try other stuff but because dealers lace their weed with cocaine and heroin to create a market.  I don't smoke anymore as I find it just makes me tired and paranoid but I am all for legalizing it. When pot is legalized, you regulate it. It is known to stunt brain growth in people under 20 so you make the legal age to purchase and consume marijuana 21. You hand out harsher sentences for trafficking and really lay down the law on anyone smoking behind the wheel or at work without a doctors note.  It would be no different then alcohol or cigarettes except probably much more thoroughly regulated.  Saying no one will smoke if weed is illigal is just silly. Saying no one underage will smoke if weed is legal is just silly.  But I'll take the lesser of two evils."

942685,Dutch01,2015-10-31 14:36:00,1431,"A very reasonable and pragmatic viewpoint, except the laced part.  I have always heard people talk about ""laced weed"" and in the decades I've spent around drug culture, I've never seen it.  I can never understand why someone would take something that sells for $50-100/gram (coke, depending on the decade we're talking about) and add it to something that sells for $10/ gram. Plus I'm not even sure how you would do it. You can't just sprinkle coke over weed. It would end up at the bottom of the bag anyways. I believe it's an urban myth, personally."
942686,Acountdeleted,2015-10-31 14:43:00,2562,"It's probably true in terms of method but in terms of reasoning behind it I totally understand it.  In college, my first weekend I was wandering around Rez and a couple of guys asked me if I wanted to come into their house and meet some new people (it's college and this was on campus so I didn't think much of it). I walk in and their kitchen table has 3 lines of cocaine running the length of the table. They told me to enjoy myself and that as a frosh special it was 'all you can eat. For free'.  I took a pass. I've never had interest or curiosity in cocaine but I know why they did it. As a 'first timer' I don't imagine I could have taken more then $30-$50 worth of drugs but they were hoping they would have college kids as customers for life.  I know it's a little more subtle with marijuana but I could see trying to get kids hooked on the harder stuff. As you said though, not totally sure how they would get it to stick."
942687,Dutch01,2015-10-31 14:51:00,1431,"I'm sure in the scenario you present it makes sense. Give someone a line, not a big investment on a new customer.  If I were a coke dealer I'd have weed on hand so if someone asks they don't go to a competitor. This all leads into my point though. Prohibition encourages people to deal with criminals who sell other drugs too."

Like I stated earlier in this thread I dont smoke to get high, more like a buzz, and with the high potency of marijuana these days all it takes is one tiny lil chunk(like half the size of a dime) to get that."

942697,Dutch01,2015-10-31 16:16:00,1431,"No all heroin is tar heroin. You could probably dissolve the heroin in a solvent (i'm not sure whether heroin is alcohol soluble, but if so you could use ISO), the spray the weed and let the alcohol evap.  Any chemists in here?  The point is, no one is going to go to that trouble to ""try to hook someone on weed "".  That's reefer madness level propaganda right there."

942591,GbayGiant,2015-10-30 20:31:00,1780,"people don't ""try"" pot in their late 30's. They either do it regularly, or are casual recreational (ie: weekend) users at that age. and you know this how?"

And as for hiding money, when people are living pay-cheque to pay-cheque, there isn't a whole lot of wealth to hide anywhere, now is there? When you have to hide your money out in the open just to make sure you can retire some day, there isn't really millions of dollars left to send to that Caymans. But of course, it's only fair that those people should be able to take advantage of loopholes while everyone below them plays by the rules. I went from a gas pump jockey at the age of 14 to owning a plumbing company with lots of assets to draw on as I age. My first investment was stocks from my job pumping gas it was not wasted on pleasures. I have not sent a dime offshore which is legal but my retirement is secure. Sorry but with sacrifice comes reward with hard work comes reward. Ask the people who have made a million and lost a million and still managed to do it again. Not everyone will become rich but trying and sacrifices will always improve your quality of living. People who are check to check did not start out that way they had to spend more than they make. For some this was not their choice due to medical or other unplanned issue. Some abuse credit and remember the difference between being in debt and not is timing. If you do not have it do not spend it. If you spend it when you have it then you have no debt.

This is......I'm not even sure how to respond to this. I have advocated for a society that a. allows responsible adults freedom of choice, where that choice does not infringe on the rights of others and b. holds individual adults responsible for their decisions - as opposed to holding us collectively to the lowest standard of the least responsible among us. I'm not sure how you make the leap from that to a wild west anarchy with shootouts to solve disagreements. Maybe I'm missing something here.... Having said that, the status quo requires me to deal with criminals in order to obtain my marijuana, so it's much more likely I will be shot now under a prohibitionist regime, than under the society I envision and advocate for.     What I propose is not only possible, but the minimum standard that we should all aspire to.   I called them losers because it was expedient, which does not make it right. I am a Child and Youth Worker by training (though I do not work in that field any longer). I have education and experience in developmental psychology and addictions counselling, so I believe I am qualified to speak on this subject. I didn't intend to disparage people who are down on their luck, and to anyone offended I apologize unreservedly. I was illustrating the point that if marijuana didn't exist, it is likely these people would be in the exact same life situation, only with a different drug of choice. In any case, because the adults in this example act irresponsibly, why should I be included in a collective sanction? Can you please quantify and qualify the manner and degree to which you believe legalization will ""damage society""? I'm looking for arguments with citations here, not anecdotes.    Who best to determine need? Drug companies with profits to earn? No thank you. I am the best person to make decisions in my life that affect no one else.   Thank you, I appreciate that (sincerely). If this place doesn't exist then I guess I will have to redouble my efforts to make it so! I am still struggling to understand why anyone believes they have the right to make my choices for me.

But as soon as I move past relative harm to individual liberty (the more relevant argument in my mind), I'm suddenly trying to foment revolution and anarchy ?!?!? How many of you on this site like being told what to do and how to live? I'm guessing none. If I was a vegetarian and attempting to force the government to ban hunting and meat eating, I would be roundly vilified (and rightly so). I am not asking anyone to change their life in any way - I don't want anyone to take up smoking, I'm not asking to smoke in front of children at a park, I'm not even asking people to like weed. I am asking them to let me make my own choices, lest I get the idea I can start making theirs for them (t!t for tat!). I Think we both want the same thing for the most part just my travel is along a different path. I grew up on a different line of thinking down here in the USA and it just won't let me grasp the way you think on some matters. I am good with that though your path just might work.

942406,aplumma,2015-10-29 18:44:00,6896,"The 1 % are the people to aspire to not the people to hate on. Along my path I had the choices to spend my money or save and make it work for me. I chose not to spend and to not have new cars when I was young. I chose to buy houses and invest in my future. I chose not to spend money on alcohol and pot or exotic vacations so when I reached 50 I am financially secure and I now have the cars and the trips and any thing else I want. I may not be a 1% but I am always talking to them for advise on how I can get there. I did not have old money to help me it is all about how bad do you want it. What will you give up to make it. I tell everyone you can be as great as you want to work to be. A few members here have overcome major(unplanned medical expenses for one) financial burdens and every time they get low on money they busted their butts to get back on the plus side of money and they did it with a smile.

They hire the best mathematicians out of uni to write algorithms, build high frequency trading hubs on internet backbone to gain fractions of a second, then sit back and collect fraction of a penny pet transaction on millions of transactions.  While your stocks tank, they make billions.  It's a scam, and we're the marks.  They use loopholes in International regulations to pay little to no tax.  Before you try to call me out on that, Warren Buffet is on record saying he pays less tax than his secretary. If you aren't in this club already, you are more likely to step foot on the moon than ever join it.  We are supposed to have a level playing field so everyone has an equal chance.

"" by giving them everything they need and want instead of saying NO work for itl"", the implications here is if someone is poor, it's their own fault. After all, they could have just worked for it.  ""Just like lazy and entitled breeds lazy and entitled ? ? ?"". This statement was made I the middle of a discussion about income inequality. It's far from unreasonable for me to infer that you are calling poor people lazy and entitled.  So yes, I did ask that question and no, you don't answer it.  I don't know if you live in Canada or the U.S., but in either case you were lucky enough to find yourself in a place where even the poorest have more than most of the rest of the world. It wasn't ONLY hard work that brought you any success, it was also random happenstance. Because if you lived in Syria, Sudan, Sri Lanka, or Yemen (just to name a few examples), you'd be lucky to be alive, and your best chance of upward mobility would be to become a good bomb maker (they're on demand right now).  I find the lack of compassion for other human beings I read in your posts unsettling. I hope I'm just wrong about you."

But I noticed in grade 11 that most (not all, but most) of my buddies that smoked every day, didn't have the marks to get into University so were dropping down to non-academic courses and were planning on stopping at 12 and getting a job.  Most of my friends that only smoked on the weekends were all thinking about what University or college they wanted to go to.  I started to realize I had bigger plans than trying to figure out how to buy the next dime bag and ditching math.  So I started to hang with the other crowd more.  Look back in your own past and your friends or yourself and think about if there is any pattern. I think there is.  That said, it makes no sense to have guys like me when I was young, or any of my friends from those days, having a criminal record.  So I am OK with decriminalization.  BUT.  I think their needs to be very tight controls over its use.  We have drinking ages for a reason and pot should also have a legal age, and its not 16.  One last point, somewhat joking.  I think that the pot legislation should divide the pot smokers and the non-pot smokers in our health care system.  Maybe a pot leaf symbol on your health card to allow you to buy pot at the outlets or LCBO or something.  Then, anyone with the ganja health card can only be seen or have surgery performed by Doctors and nurses that are carrying the same card."

It's all a matter of choices in life........some decided to not further their education after high school and smoke dope for a pastime while others looked further into the future and wanted a better life then their parents. I say GOOD FOR THEM.
942372,Canuck2fan,2015-10-29 16:01:00,1444,"10 Milion for a up grade. You're kidding. A 1 milion dollar place would be enough And it just started!!!!!  Sadly, all PM's for last 40 years have been too afraid to do what needs to be done. If it wasn't a historical building we could rip it down and put up a damn fine replacement for a couple million.... Since it is a historical building all the work has to be done WITHOUT changing the appearance or destroying the heritage. Work on historical buildings is NEVER cheap because the materials aren't readily available at home depot and the workers with the skills to replicate how things used to be done won't work for free.  24 Sussex it isn't just a home for the Prime Minister, it is our White House or 10 Downing Street, where Canada's leader is supposed to represent our great country to other world and business leaders. It doesn't leave a good impression to have rain water dripping into the guests soup during a formal dinner.  The U.S. went through this in 49 when Truman was forced to move out of the White House and a 55+ million dollar renovation, in today's dollars was done. Here is a link to some images from that project.  https://www.google.ca/search?q=truman+white+house+reconstruction&espv=2&biw=1180&bih=510&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0CBsQsARqFQoTCKvexrSG6MgCFcEmHgod4g8Jww"

It's this kind of thinking, always blaming others that will hold down most of the population down while others have that twinkle in the eye and the energy to be a better citizen, father, wife or neighbor through hard work.  I will tell you one thing, the poverty population will continue to grow because now we have treated them like a separate community by giving them everything they need and want instead of saying NO work for it. All these different charities are actually harming them more then helping them and now it's out of control. You can't go anywhere without someone asking for another donation. It's sad."

942208,Big Cliff,2015-10-28 19:37:00,6899,"Please explain Cliff, please explain the problems it has caused. Please, let us all know the real issues of Pot and the harm it causes? Don't just say someone had issues. Explain yourself .,, That way I can try to show the error in that kind of thinking.   It's been drilled into everyones mind.  the truth is coming out.  Please explain the issues at hand Sir. I'l try and quench each thought as you go.  Fair enough ? What part of this don't you understand?:  I know that pot has ruined a few lives, I know a family that have borrowed money from and stolen from almost every member of the family so they could buy their $300.00 or $400.00 a month in pot. I have seen them borrow money from friends, hock family jewlery for peanuts and never get it back, go to the food bank get what they can and sell it, send their kids to school without proper shoes or food...... all so they could buy their bag of pot. They spend anywhere from $300.00 to $400.00 a month on pot and more if they can get it.  (Most of the family won't even let them in the house any more because of the thefts. I know for a fact she pawned her grandmothers rings and other jewlery for pennies of what it was worth just so she could buy pot.  They bought a car from a family member for a very good price because someone was trying to help them get back on their feet then never paid for the car, borrowed money from her grandmother and anyone else that she could because she always had a good jerk story and never paid it back.  They moved in to a family members basement apartment because they had no jobs and no place to live, it was a beautiful two bedroom apartment and all they were suppose to do was pay utilities and help out around the place. They never paid a cent, never contributed an hour of help, caused hundreds of dollars in damages and finally had to be forced out ""but they always had enough money to go buy their bag of pot!""  It has driven a wedge between other family members to the point where many of them don't even talk to each other any more. Her own father she bled dry to the point where when he passed away there was no money to bury him other than what the government paid and even then she was trying to figure out how she could score a few bucks. It was so bad that even her own brother and sister wouldn't attend the service. Go ahead and pick that apart all you want)   I know another young man, never did drink, just doesn't like the stuff, use to fish and hunt all the time, loved being out doors and always worked hard; today you can't get him off the couch, he doesn't get excited about anything unless he is down to his last bud or vial of oil and even then it is like he is in a fog. You can tell me it doesn't ruin lives but I have seen it with my own eyes but to be honest with you I have seen a lot more lives ruined from booze than from pot!  ( what use to be a bright hard working bright young man with a beautiful family is now out of work more than he is in it, doesn't get to see most of the rest of the family just because he can't be bothered, his sister has stage four nonhodgkins lymphoma and is on her fifth round of chemo. He is always too busy ""sitting out back smoking a joint"" to even go and see her. The only time he has even seen his father in the last three years is when his father makes the effort to go and see him and then it's sit and watch him smoke up"".)  You go right ahead and pick that apart all you want! I am not saying that pot should be banned, I have seen booze do a lot more damage but you can't tell me pot has never destroyed any families!  Now if that hasn't explained the issues clearly enough maybe it's time to cut back a little"
942215,Dutch01,2015-10-28 20:09:00,1431," First, no offense but these people you describe are losers.  The world is full of them.  But pot is not why they are losers. If it wasn't pot, it would be something else (another drug, food, sex, etc.).  If they were fat and dying of heart disease, while still stuffing their faces with cheeseburgers, would you be blaming beef? Would you be saying beef should be banned for everyone because *some* people can't handle it? I seriously doubt that.  I know you are just responding to a question, so I'm not singling you out specifically.  I can't change attitudes by staying silence though. I want society to start holding individuals responsible for their failings.  I want society to stop telling me that I have to live a certain way because someone else f*cked up.  I often hear people from older generations than mine say that the problem with society is that no one is held responsible for their actions anymore.  They may well be correct. In this case, those two parents are the problem, and I shouldn't be affected as a result of their failings."

I have nothing against pot or booze or even tobacco for that matter, each to their own. You want to come sit on my deck and twist one I'd have no problem with that, heck I might even share a toke with you but steal from me so you have enough money to go buy pot/booze/smokes, now that I would have a problem with.

The down side is so does everyone else. You smoke your weed and I get to shoot you because I want to exercise my right of not having weed smoked around me. The argument you propose is just not possible so to argue it is to go to hypothetical situations that have no relevants in living here and now.  I have had lots of people as you call losers who are just people who are down on there luck and with a helping hand they climb back up into society. The ones that turn to drugs, alcohol, or other life numbing items will stay down in the hole. Making a drug easier and glorifying it just as we did to alcohol and tobacco will damage society. Make it a pharmaceutical regulate it, tax it and limit its availability to those that need it is fine.

She didn't want it so gave it to me to help my pain and disability from broken back and relapsing-progressive MS.  I too use it for the exact same thing..I have been making my own RSO (weed oil) and eating a small rice sized bit every night before bed..I have never slept so well , I have lost weight and gotten off blood pressure pills for the first time since I was 30.. im 41 now.  I have zero lifestyle changes..The only thing that has changed is the consumption of the oil.. works as a good pain killer  It did relieve pain for sure. Did the rice size bit in the morning to take edge off pain (never had sleep problem). It would make me more active and quite productive. Kinda was equal to 3 beer sipped over 12 hr.  Would have some for 6 months go without for 6 months. No addiction but desired the relief. Maybe i should drink sometime.   Once cannabis is legalized not much will change in our society.

That's an issue when you look at a family living in poverty. Kids suffer because of the choice made by their parent.  Some parents also buy fancy cell phones and big screen TV's but get food stamps and welfare from the government. They spend their $$$ on non-essentials while their kids go without essential items.  Both these scenarios are about poor choices nothing more.

And as for the ""ruining lives"" argument: I think it comes down to what people are capable of regardless of what drug or crutch they have. Smoking weed isn't going to ruin the lives of normal people.

This new found property makes cannabinoids useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of wide variety of oxidation associated diseases, such as ischemic, age-related, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The cannabinoids are found to have particular application as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage following ischemic insults, such as stroke and trauma, or in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and HIV dementia. Nonpsychoactive cannabinoids, such as cannabidoil, are particularly advantageous to use because they avoid toxicity that is encountered with psychoactive cannabinoids at high doses useful in the method of the present invention.

The drunk driver or a stoned driver are both impaired. The diminished capacity of the brain on drugs no matter what form either alcohol or pot has repercussions both to ones self and other innocent people around you. I have been around both people who are stoned and people who are drunk and there is no way you can say they are at 100% of there game while enjoying either one. I think pot as a medication is viable thing but to add another way to incapacitate ones self is socially self destructive.

942028,Big Cliff,2015-10-27 20:38:00,6899,"I know that pot has ruined a few lives, I know a family that have borrowed money from and stolen from almost every member of the family so they could buy their $300.00 or $400.00 a month in pot. I have seen them borrow money from friends, hock family jewlery for peanuts and never get it back, go to the food bank get what they can and sell it, send their kids to school without proper shoes or food......  all so they could buy their bag of pot.  Now, that being said; this same family would probably be spending it on booze (and they do some of that too) or cigaretts which they also do if it wasn't for the pot so it is unfair to claim that pot is to blame. They have just chosen a life style that they will live regardless of who else suffers.  I know another young man, never did drink, just doesn't like the stuff, use to fish and hunt all the time, loved being out doors and always worked hard; today you can't get him off the couch, he doesn't get excited about anything unless he is down to his last bud or vial of oil and even then it is like he is in a fog. You can tell me it doesn't ruin lives but I have seen it with my own eyes but to be honest with you I have seen a lot more lives ruined from booze than from pot!  I have smoked pot; YES, YES, it's true   but I didn't inhale (well maybe a bit once in a while  ). It was fun at the time but that was a long time ago before this stuff got so potent, heck we could smoke a joint and giggle and all was good.  A few years ago I took a couple of drags on a joint (I was in a drunken stupor at the time  , well at least that's my excuse) I was so wasted It scared the heck out of me and I haven't touched it since.  I do believe there is a place for it, I am told that it really helps with the nausia from chemo treatments and several people I know that suffer chronic pain say that without it their lives would be hell. As a recreational thing, well I think tobacco already does enough damage but I don't know if pot is any better or worse.  I do know that if it was legal a lot of people would grow their own, heck a half dozen good plants would probably produce enough to supply the average person for a year or two. Think of all the money the drug pushers would loose, heck they might even have to go get real jobs! But lets work a few numbers; 6 really good plants would probably yield 6 lbs of pot. 6 lbs of good pot = about $3000.00/lb = $18,000.00.  Well that would put all that extra money in famlies pockets and take it out of the drug dealers pockets. It would also save our police forces and courts huge amounts of money in trying to catch and prosecute people for having small amounts of pot and think of all the lawyers that would have their incomes reduced from being able to prosecute or defend pot users.

Our democracy is sounding more and more like a dictatorship every day!  I recognize that we live in a social(ist) democracy.  I grumble about high taxes (like everyone else), but I am generally happy that I live in a safe, kind and generous country (many caveats to that statement but that's not the rabbit hole I'm headed down here).  Yes, the government creates laws, but they have limits.  First, we have a Charter of Rights and Freedoms that limits the laws government can pass.  We also have a Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of laws passed by parliament.  So the notion that a law is just because it's a law is a logical fallacy.  For example, you can do something legal that is immoral - ie. Bank CEO's getting bonuses after creating a global financial crash that hurt us all - and escape legal punishment.  But you're still wrong.  You can do the right thing, but still be breaking the law.  I'm stretching for an example because I am pressed for time (BBQ is almost heated up!).  I believe it was Peru that passed a law recently that said abortion is illegal under all circumstances, even a pregnancy that was caused by rape or threatens the mother's life.  In this case, a women who chose to have an abortion rather than die is breaking the law, but in my opinion doing the right thing (who am I to judge her choice anyways?).  At one time it was actually illegal to sleep with another man.  Now that idea is anathema to current public opinion.  The point I am making is that there are issues where the government has no business telling me what to do, and I believe personal use of marijuana is one of those areas.  I refuse to be told what I can and can't do on this issue.  If that means I have to go to jail, you can be sure I will be appealing to the SOC en route to the slammer!  This is silly but what the heck:  When the cops came for the stoners, I remained silent; I was not a stoner.  When they locked up the drinkers and smokers, I remained silent; I was not a drinker or a smoker.  When they came for the meat eaters, I did not speak out; I was not a meat eater.  When they came for the hunters, I remained silent; I wasn't a a hunter.  When they came for me, there was no one left to speak out.      We all have to speak out for each other.

941266,manitoubass2,2015-10-23 15:14:00,11391,I fully support the legalization of marijuana for both medical and personal use.  Its from nature for frig sakes and not altered (as opposed to coca and poppy)  Heck id even have zero issues with mushrooms being legal

Dont get me wrong, im not going to vouch for people doing anything to their bodies, be it weed, liquour or even fast food...but everyone dabbles time to time in some kind of vice do they not? if you dont, well holy crepe good on you!  I think the biggest point of contention with all of this is people driving under the influence...which i will never condone be it, the drink, the weed or the pain killers or any other mind altering substance. i think that has been the biggest difficulty in the whole legalization discussion. Aside from that though, the idea of taxing it like alcohol not only saves on, enforcement, and legal costs, it also removes billions of dollars in funding from organized crime as well as increasing public safety.  All while becoming an additional revenue source for the government...how can you lose?   Manitou, in the essence of the government being so concerned with public safety, ive heard of people having bad trips...and getting in to trouble...dont get me wrong people do terrible things while drinking too...its just all relative i guess."
941269,Oggie,2015-10-23 15:30:00,588,Long term excessive use of weed is no different than long term excessive use of alcohol IMO.  It does seem to relieve pain and discomfort in some people but I'm not buying that it IMPROVES your health if you're healthy to start with.  I'd legalize it and tax the hell out of it just like alcohol.
941270,Dutch01,2015-10-23 15:31:00,1431,"Most polls I read still put a third or so of the country in the anti-legalization camp. On the plus side, I do believe that number is going to dwindle further with time.  I agree with you regarding impaired driving, but I don't consider that issue to be related specifically to weed. We should add texting, reading the newspaper, putting on lipstick and every other kind of distraction or impairment to that list (you wouldn't believe the things I see Toronto drivers do!). Driving is a privilege (legally speaking), and with freedom comes responsibility.  I guess that's kind of my point. Hold people responsible for their own actions. Don't hold me responsible for what others might do.  Impaired driving can't be the ""reason"" (excuse) for not legalizing. Impaired driving is dangerous and illegal. Increase enforcement, increase penalties. If we as a society limit the most responsible of our citizens to only the freedoms that the least responsible can handle, we wouldn't be a free society at all."
941271,dave524,2015-10-23 15:36:00,4508," Income splitting benefited me, and I was not in a high income tax bracket last year.  My wife of 16 years is a landed immigrant, never worked a day in Canada or gets a penny of pension, although he says he is not touching income splitting for pensions, the loss of splitting would be disastrous for me. The TFSA is really not a big deal, you don't get  a tax deduction on the amount you put in like an RRSP, only no tax is paid on the interest or other income earned within the plan, with the puny interest rates of today or market conditions it really don't amount to a hill of beans."
941275,Big Cliff,2015-10-23 15:46:00,6899,"Legalize it already. For recreation as well. The same bud is used for both situations, if you think its different your sadly mistaken. I don't think these old fart politicians should be making the rules on cannabis when most say they have never tried it. Maybe get a panel of long time cannabis users and scientists to sit down and hammer out a new policy.  It should be regulated and taxed but not over taxed because that will just defeat the purpose of getting rid of the black market. Growing your own has to be included as well. Most people will go to the store to buy it anyways just like tomatoes.  Taking cannabis is a great way to maintain good health. Ingesting the oil is the best way but smoking is the easiest for most since oil capsules are not readily available. Topical cremes and tinctures are going to be a huge part of the business in the near future.  My 80 yr old mother has arthritis in her knee and foot that's been bothering her for awhile. A few weeks ago I ordered her some marijuana cream to put on the affected areas. She has been applying it two or three times a day for the last couple weeks and when I spoke to her yesterday she said she has been pain free for about 3 days now. The cream is infused with cannabis resin and is 100% natural ingredients.  As for me I have been a consumer for forty years and haven't had to take a prescription drug for at least thirty five years and am in perfect health at 55 yrs of age. I also live a healthy lifestyle of course, don't smoke, not much of a drinker, and no fast foods and very little fried foods. Call me what you will but I think the use of cannabis has played a large part in maintaining my good health.  M.D.s quite frankly scare the crap out of me. I look at how unhealthy society is and have to say I give them a failing grade. There the best when it comes to trauma because that is what their trained for. But for nutrition there the last person you should be talking to. They have no interest in curing disease or even want to know why you have it. All they are interested in is managing disease because you are a customer to them. Sad to say but that is how I feel People have to start taking control of their own health if you want to stay healthy. End of rant lol. There are a lot more old drunks and pot users running around than there are old Dr.s You just might have something there!"

941285,manitoubass2,2015-10-23 16:21:00,11391,"No, not at all. And cannabinoids stay in the system long since they like fat cells.  Only way I could tell is the pupil test.  But i am positive a simple test could easily be designed to measure cannabinoids in the bloodstream. It wouldnt be hard"

941288,Dutch01,2015-10-23 16:25:00,1431,"There currently isn't a roadside test, no.  Several companies are working on one though.  I'm not sutre why that should be a roadblock to legalization.  There's currently no roadside test for how long you have been awake, no test for cough medicine or legal opiate's such as oxycodone, etc.  Also, under current law, an officer can charge you for impaired driving under the influence of marijuana solely based on his observations/professional opinion.  If you have an accident then they can blood test you as well."
941289,manitoubass2,2015-10-23 16:25:00,11391,"But thats a slippery slope.  I might add its very dangerous to operate a vehicle under the use of opiates as well, or other narcotics  Thats important to.  If someone has prescribed opiates should they have their license pulled since they are basically under narcotic influence 24 hours a day?"
941290,manitoubass2,2015-10-23 16:26:00,11391,Heck even driving on Nyquil is dangerous

But i am positive a simple test could easily be designed to measure cannabinoids in the bloodstream. It wouldnt be hard   All of the states that have legalized weed have blood tests that are administered when one is suspected of driving under the influence. The test measures the amount of THC in the system and if above a certain level you are considered impaired just like if you had too much to drink.  Unfortunately there is no roadside breathalyzer type test. The cops are trained in spotting the symptoms of stoned people.  Even if a breathalyzer is used road side to arrest someone for alcohol impairment they do several tests back @ the station in order to confirm the fact the person is drunk."

If you want to see how some of the problems with production, licensing and the sale of pot is administered check out Pot Barons of Colorado on youtube.  As for use in public here is a site on how that is handled.  http://blogs.findlaw.com/blotter/2014/07/is-it-legal-to-be-high-in-public.html  As for driving under the influence, it will be societal pressure more than anything else that help keep it under control. Having draconian laws only goes so far. The big strides against drinking and driving have come from people who stop other people and general awareness. The same thing can work for pot, texting and other distractions. Of course it will still happen no matter what but hopefully to a lessor degree."

You're right though, being drunk or high at work no matter what your profession is a bad idea, but making it legally available isn't going to change that. You have reasonable concerns but I think they all have pretty simple solutions/answers.  The only thing they need is a proper way to test people for intoxication like a Breathalyzer.

Now let's say richer family is single income and wife stays home with kids. that's keeping daycare costs in their pockets.  two people making less per year shouldn't, imo, have to pay as much as a single earner making what the couple is making.  won't even get into single parent households which obviously won't benefit from the split.  if we all agreed on everything this would be a boring board but this is my take.  I still say let's see how things shake out, unfortunately or fortunately depending on your political bent, nothing can be done till the four years runs out. so fingers crossed. tightly lol  You can write off 8 or 9k in daycare (against the lower income) if you are both working.

I wish I could pull up my post on here, from circa 2003, when I made a comment about enjoying a puff while fishing.  the VAST MAJORITY of this board ripped me a new arse for saying it. Many members, and no I'm not naming names, were 100% against it...while now those same people are singing a different tune....  AND THAT IS FANTASTIC!  folks are opening their eyes and minds to the truths....it is great to see a society start to become more tolerant. Its no longer considered (by most) to be the evil devil it was once looked at as.  Still a few folks refuse to accept....we'll see how the coppers handle it when they lose their revenue stream for seizing goods relating to the criminal sales. Colorado, the first to legalize, had a number of cops interviewed...and the cops said they truly didn't care that it was legal, but they missed the seizures they had relating to the criminal aspects of it....but the state collected so much taxes that the state funneled some extra coin to the coppers, and they quickly shut up about it....  all about getting their dollars.  Even Bill Blair has done a total 180, now that he's not a cop. When he was a cop, he advised that pot should be kept illegal (gee, what a surprise).  Now that he isn't part of the blue brotherhood, he's all for the legalization of it.  Anyway, glad to see the tune has changed by the majority of our population...and for those who refuse to change...well.....so be it...they are now the minority, not the majority."

How about we do the same with pot and see if it works since the status quo has not made a dent in usage rates?  Also, as posted above, pot use among youth is correlated with schizophrenia, but correlation is not the same as causation. Pot does not cause schizophrenia, period. It can only advance the onset of it.  It's important to be clear about that point. We cannot base sound public policy on propaganda and lies.

940859,Dutch01,2015-10-21 18:05:00,1431," Trudeau is not an ""admitted pot head"". He admitted to using it once after a dinner party. More than 3 million Canadians have admitted to trying pot in their lives, so he is not alone. As for the USA, they are leading the charge right now and we are behind the curve.  Finally, and the most fundamental issue for me, is the matter of civil liberty. I do not accept this government's right to infringe on my civil liberties unless they can show demonstrable harm to society will result. No government hearings of this sort have ever made the determination that my personal pot use causes harm to society (quite the opposite in fact, see the Le Dain commission).  Further, I do not accept unequal treatment under the law. If alcohol, which is demonstrably harmful, is legal, then the government cannot make a case that pot prohibition is about the degree to which a drug (which alcohol also is) is harmful.  I do not agree with organized religion (and on another day in another forum I could perhaps make the case it is more harmful than pot), but I will fight for your right to believe and worship because I believe I have to live and let live.  The same can be said of those here who in recent weeks have used derogatory slurs against Wynne.  I despise the woman personally, but I respect her right to sleep with whom she wants.  We, as Canadians, have to decide if we want a truly free society. If the answer is yes, you are going to have to tolerate some things you don't like (as others may have to tolerate your lifestyle choices that they may disagree with).  That's the kind of Canada that I want to live in. How about you?"
940867,Dutch01,2015-10-21 18:13:00,1431,"You're the guy who made the derogatory slur about Wynne right? If so, I'm not interested in what you bring to the table. If I am wrong and it wasn't you then I apologize."

An entertainment ""news"" presenter as the next PM? I will grant that a lot of people vote for the cool guy because they think it's a popularity contest, but absolutely no one will take Ben Mulroney and his fake orange tan seriously.  As for the fresh weed debate... If there are medicinal uses for it, which I'm honestly on the fence about too (a friend of mine who is a pharmacist and has smoked as much weed as anyone I know says there are far better synthetic options to treat the symptoms that marijuana reportedly treats), then fully legalizing more recreational use removes its status as medicine, doesn't it? Don't get me wrong, if it were legalized in Canada I'd be more than willing to buy some. The biggest issue with marijuana is the fact that it is illegal. The most unsafe thing most people do with marijuana is buy and distribute it illegally. Otherwise it's relatively harmless. Definitely no more or less harmful than many shelf bought or over the counter recreational and medicinal drugs currently available at your local drug store, liquor store or corner store."

940886,Dutch01,2015-10-21 19:14:00,1431," Prescription drug overdoses cause 23.6 deaths per 100,000 people every year in Canada (Source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2789126/). To put that in perspective, many on this very site have ranted about the ""rampant"" gun killings in the USA recently.  Homicides by gun in the USA occur at a rate of about 3.5 homicides per 100,000 people (source: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/homicide.htm)  According to these stats, we have an epidemic of deaths by prescription overdose. But by all means, lets listen to these drug companies say ""weed is bad, Mmmkay?"" while they wash the blood off of their hands."
940891,Dara,2015-10-21 19:43:00,3052,"Since your primary criteria appears to be safety, I assume you support full prohibition for alcohol, cigarettes, transfats and any recreational activity that can lead to harm?  Trudeau is not an ""admitted pot head"". He admitted to using it once after a dinner party. More than 3 million Canadians have admitted to trying pot in their lives, so he is not alone. As for the USA, they are leading the charge right now and we are behind the curve.  Finally, and the most fundamental issue for me, is the matter of civil liberty. I do not accept this government's right to infringe on my civil liberties unless they can show demonstrable harm to society will result. No government hearings of this sort have ever made the determination that my personal pot use causes harm to society (quite the opposite in fact, see the Le Dain commission). Further, I do not accept unequal treatment under the law. If alcohol, which is demonstrably harmful, is legal, then the government cannot make a case that pot prohibition is about the degree to which a drug (which alcohol also is) is harmful.  I do not agree with organized religion (and on another day in another forum I could perhaps make the case it is more harmful than pot), but I will fight for your right to believe and worship because I believe I have to live and let live. The same can be said of those here who in recent weeks have used derogatory slurs against Wynne. I despise the woman personally, but I respect her right to sleep with whom she wants.  We, as Canadians, have to decide if we want a truly free society. If the answer is yes, you are going to have to tolerate some things you don't like (as others may have to tolerate your lifestyle choices that they may disagree with). That's the kind of Canada that I want to live in. How about you?   Yup, I'll go along with all of it, including the religion part. The only part I disagree with is the One time at a party...no way did he just try pot one time at a dinner party.  Same with Wynne, trash her for her fiscal policies but don't bring orientation into the mix  I have only heard the schizophrenia argument for being against pot. The Harvard study will make me look a bit closer. I have 2 brothers greatly affected by the disease so I am a bit biased but willing to learn"

Think about how much more productive any worker here whether white collar or blue collar has to be, to offset a MONTHLY price increase in the cost of single family dwelling of 8600.00. That is how much those types of homes went up by averaged over a year in Toronto. I don't care how hard anyone works it isn't sustainable in any field to out compete the rest of the world with those types of cost increases for accommodation. (I realize that Toronto is a high extreme but the trend is the same pretty much the same a slightly slower pace anywhere there are good employment opportunities.)  A lot people will say, yeah but my house has appreciated so much I am getting rich. Which is only true if you can sell it for more so you can then live somewhere for less.
