942361,netminder,2015-10-29 14:54:00,514,"according to the report, a fence blew down and allowed the dog out unto the street. It didn't sound like it was on the loose often   Of course we don't really know the facts-----just what was in the media reports. The relationship between those 2 things can be quite tenuous!!! Reporters don't tell facts, they tell stories. Some hack at the local rag probably caught on to this and thought he stumbled upon a goldmine flooded with oil.  Police officer behaving badly? check  Old defenceless dog? check  Grainy video with women crying and screaming? check  Possibility of headline resulting in instant public outrage and page clicks? you betcha  The more I think about this, the more I have to believe that there was no way to go about this. Animal reported as coyote, acting funny, therefore possibly rabid. Would you get out of your car? Even if you did, would you open fire in a residential neighbourhood? I'm sure this guy feels bad for what he did, even if it turns out it was a coyote. It's not like he was the officer in the other facebook video I recently saw where he knocked on the door, shot the dog three times and then calmly walked away while the dog bled out on the walkway."

942618,irishfield,2015-10-30 22:36:00,26272,I wish we could just go back to the days of the rotary dial phone screwed to the wall...
942619,crappieperchhunter,2015-10-30 22:46:00,2582,I wish we could just go back to the days of the rotary dial phone screwed to the wall... I'm still sorta there Wayne!!!!  My only phone is still screwed to the wall....it's just not a rotary dial.  But I hear what your saying and I agree 100%.
942632,SirCranksalot,2015-10-30 23:38:00,3291,I wish we could just go back to the days of the rotary dial phone screwed to the wall...   What about the ones with a hand crank? Did you throw out yours already??
942635,Steve,2015-10-30 23:44:00,2075,I wish we could just go back to the days of the rotary dial phone screwed to the wall...  So do many cops.  I'm happy that little brother is watching.
942639,manitoubass2,2015-10-31 00:11:00,11391,Me as well

942645,porkpie,2015-10-31 00:32:00,2521,"LOL, can't you just shoot him in the leg."
942658,manitoubass2,2015-10-31 02:24:00,11391,"Well in theory, absolutely!"
942671,davey buoy,2015-10-31 12:11:00,5505,"LOL, can't you just shoot him in the leg. That I could not agree more with !!"
941035,chris.brock,2015-10-22 04:41:00,4053,"yeah, lots.  I am always held responsible. So should everyone else be held responsible, cops, docs, teachers, politicians...  I think Bowslayer should stay in Canada, it's the people with coyote phobia that should consider moving somewhere else."
941037,manitoubass2,2015-10-22 06:01:00,11391,This is silly  Im with chris on this.  Coyotes are out howling as I write this. Last thought on my mind is calling the OPP.
941038,Joey,2015-10-22 06:27:00,9122,"It's Canada, there are coyotes and wolves.  Run them over????"
941058,SirCranksalot,2015-10-22 12:48:00,3291,"Maybe they've been watching ""The Grey"" movie!!"
941060,netminder,2015-10-22 12:50:00,514,"I'm not going to watch the video, but something tells me this wasn't the right way to handle this. I don't know what would be the right way, but running it over and then backing up and then shooting it seems... inhumane.  Another point though, it was storming outside hard enough to blow over a fence. In a suburban neighbourhood like this why did this woman leave her 21-year-old deaf dog outside in the first place?  Anyway, here's a news article about it:  http://www.thespec.com/news-story/5970899-owner-feels-sick-after-opp-admit-killing-dog-they-thought-was-a-coyote/"

941077,BillM,2015-10-22 14:57:00,17367,A 21 year old dog?  Is that some sort of record? lol
941079,manitoubass2,2015-10-22 15:10:00,11391,I was thinking the same!
941102,Big Cliff,2015-10-22 17:04:00,6899,"There are too many unanswered questions here to pass judgement on anyone. I will say this; if I had a 21 year old blind, deaf dog with dementia we would have made a one way trip to the vets before this could have ever happened. Non the less it sure is a heart breaker."
941111,Cloudy15,2015-10-22 17:55:00,141,"I wonder what sort of collar it had on? Might have to go and buy my dog a brighter and more distinct, maybe an orange vest as well.."
941112,Big Cliff,2015-10-22 18:23:00,6899,"Well, if you have a 21 year old, blind, deaf dog with dementia and you are going to let it out to wander around on a stormy night, it might be a good idea!"
941122,jimmer,2015-10-22 19:43:00,2730,Making a mistake in the social media age is something else.
941123,solopaddler,2015-10-22 19:49:00,8605,Watching the video was like a scene out of Superbad.
941138,Gallie,2015-10-22 21:49:00,1215,"This was too hard to watch, i dont see a good enough reason for this to have happened how it did. The only thing i can think is that he was scared and if thats the case he could have called for assistance to put the animal down. Doesnt matter how old the dog is or what ailments it may face, if you cant properly identify the animal what business do you have killing it? if that was a hunter who thought he was shooting a coyote and it was a dog he would be grilled to the max and likely be charged."
941139,davey buoy,2015-10-22 21:54:00,5505,"3 times,c'mon,way to excessive IMO.No excuse unless the dog was causing harm.I'm not a cop,and I would think that is probably not the best way to go about this?.Guess we'll find out more soon enough."
941152,FloatnFly,2015-10-22 23:07:00,1640,A 21 year old dog?  Is that some sort of record? lol   mixed breeds tend to live longer than purebreds. a neighbour around the corner from me has a daschhound mix breed that 19 years old in fairly good health age considering
941409,pics,2015-10-24 01:01:00,1268,95% of cops are great but these days with social media and cameras the bad ones are exposed pretty quickly. The cop had no reason to kill it the way he did. I had an old dog that would sometimes wander if I accidentally left my gate open... I would be devastated if she died that way..
941474,moxie,2015-10-24 13:14:00,1566,Another fine example of well paid mediocrity in the public service.

941990,Terry,2015-10-27 15:45:00,14456,If he thought it was rabid and did not want it attacking him. Running it down would seem ok to me. Had it been rabid and locals were afraid. They may have called him a hero If someone told me there was a rabid coyote  in my driveway. I wouldn't think twice. It would be ran down.   People come first with me period.
942066,Sinker,2015-10-27 22:59:00,8692,Does that dog look like a yote to you?
942077,manitoubass2,2015-10-27 23:20:00,11391, Cops maybe not so much.  I dont like it but Terry raised a good point(s)
942108,Paudash,2015-10-28 03:26:00,273,still have to ask why was not on a leash and how does a 21 year old blind dog run away  To me it looks more like the neighbors were tiered  of this dog running around so they made up a story and called the cops.

940952,huddy,2015-10-21 23:36:00,16,"Not sure how to post a link, but apparently an OPP officer purposely hit a 21 year old dog thinking he was killing a coyote in Collingwood. Many people disgusted/disappointed with his actions. He then proceeded to shoot it. Video was posted by a resident on you tube."
940953,Whitespinnerbait,2015-10-21 23:52:00,2038,Wasn't intentional !!!!
940954,Paudash,2015-10-21 23:53:00,273,Don't point your anger at the cop who thought he was doing the right thing Point it at the owner that let the dog run freely  It was not only the cop that thought it was a coyote it was the people watching and the person that called it in as a rabid animal
940956,Burtess,2015-10-22 00:12:00,901,"Wasn't intentional???  Doing the right thing??   Shoot the ""coyote"" if it was deemed dangerous..... don't run it over.... bad judgement call by the officer.  Burt"
940958,bow slayer,2015-10-22 00:13:00,1074,"if doing the right thing is running over a blind deaf 21 year old dog 3 times,then I have nothing more to say. It was intentional he backed up and run it over . The lengths at which people will defend anything cops do amazes me."
940959,FloatnFly,2015-10-22 00:16:00,1640,Was it intentional? absolutely......did he know it was a family pet and not a wild dog? maybe not
940960,irishfield,2015-10-22 00:18:00,26272,"Knew a gal that did that during her drivers test in grade 11. Not allowed to back up so they went around the block and hit the dog again. She failed, as did this officer."
940961,huddy,2015-10-22 00:21:00,16,Domestic pet or rabid coyote I think it was inhumane what he did. He could have dispatched the dog with his sidearm if he was to scared to get out and investigate.
940965,jtracc,2015-10-22 00:42:00,97,It was the same cop that shot the bear
940967,FloatnFly,2015-10-22 00:45:00,1640,"Yes, he could have got out and shot the animal, however, hes in a residential neighbourhood, where there have several complaints about coyotes killing pets, the dog was over 20, deaf, with dementia, it was dark, say the officer tries to shoot the animal in middle of the street, and misses, and hits a bystander? what then?  the officer i believe was trying to both maim/kill the animal by running it over, so that the risk of a miss when the animal was shot was not there"
940970,BowSlayer101,2015-10-22 00:48:00,296,Not the first time something like this has happened. Last year I witnessed an RCMP officer in B.C. shoot a youbd deer crossing a road closed from both sides. Some people wonder why I'm not a supporter of our police...
940977,jtracc,2015-10-22 01:09:00,97,Have you ever had to call 911 for police assistance because of an emergency?  Have you ever been in a car accident where police showed up to take care of the scene?  What would you do if you showed up and had to arrest a billionaire for killing 3 children and thier grandfather because he decided to drive home drunk?  Some people wonder why I'm not a supporter of ignorant people...
940984,mr blizzard,2015-10-22 01:19:00,1589,"yes they are cops not co s, have u never made a mistake in your occupation, really but when u have an issue with your property who r u going to call, the  cos apparently according to cliff u might have to wait  a few weeks, stop the bashing, maybe some of u should change your occupation and your underware, grow up maybe your jobs should be in the public eye its easy to judge behind a glass screen"
940987,mr blizzard,2015-10-22 01:27:00,1589,"if u don't like supporting our police go and live in another corrupt country and see what happens u will wish u lived in Canada, u don't know your freedoms till u lose them  Tell that to ww1 and ww2 vets and the military officer who lost his life in Quebec and the other officer who died in Ottawa, I believe his memorial is tomorrow Bowslayer if u don't like living in Canada leave, and Wayne I am surprized"
940988,Pigeontroller,2015-10-22 01:27:00,2793,If the dog was 21 it was Euthanasia!

941002,G.mech,2015-10-22 01:46:00,830,Here's a link to the CBC report.  https://youtu.be/2TIbOKGCGOA  No comment beyond that.
941008,SirCranksalot,2015-10-22 01:58:00,3291,"the officer i believe was trying to both maim/kill the animal by running it over, so that the risk of a miss when the animal was shot was not there  After running over it he got out and shot it.  So the danger of a miss was still there. Can a cop 'miss' if he's essentially aiming at the ground?"
941009,fishing n autograph,2015-10-22 01:59:00,2540,Anything is possible but I'd be more concerned about fragmentation and possibly hitting the civilian onlookers
941012,woodenboater,2015-10-22 02:04:00,2277,don't know if he had one or not but could the dog not have been tazed ?
941014,fishing n autograph,2015-10-22 02:05:00,2540,Taser isn't used for that. Why immobilize a wounded animal?
941018,woodenboater,2015-10-22 02:11:00,2277,"I dunno, as an alternative for shooting it ? I haven't seen the video so just wondering how similar this dog looks to a coyote. If the dog was a snarling mess of teeth I would understand the extreme prejudice..."
941023,SuperDave,2015-10-22 02:30:00,204,I believe the officer did what he thought was best with the info. he was given. I also believe they didn't want to shoot in case they missed. It's an unfortunate incident.
941024,FloatnFly,2015-10-22 02:32:00,1640,"the dog looked be some kind of sheppard/husky mix, so in the dark, it most certainly would have looked like a wild dog, could have had rabies, the mange, probably confused from dementia, not an easy situation to be in"
941025,leaf4,2015-10-22 02:34:00,2466,"Tough call, you have reports of a wild animal from people thinking its a coyote/wolf, what any of us would do in the same situation is hard to say"
