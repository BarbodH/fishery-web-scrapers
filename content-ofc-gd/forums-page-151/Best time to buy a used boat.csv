943371,CRUD150,2015-11-04 19:49:00,87,"So I just picked up my first boat today.  Its a 14' Lund with a 20 on the back.  Comes with a sweet trolling motor and 2 fish finders.  The inside is pretty much all set up and I don't even think I have to do anything.  I like to thank Hoser (Mark) for setting me up with his fathers boat.  You guys gave me a deal and I appreciate it.  Its a beauty and I promise to treat her well.  Also like to thank Big Cliff and Sinker for pointing me to another one, but unfortunately it wasn't the one.  Thanks guys  Oh yes, it is your first boat!  Congrats on the new vessel!"
943380,misfish,2015-11-04 21:25:00,29133,Nice unit for sure.  Nice buy.
941507,LostAnotherOne,2015-10-24 15:39:00,956,"Heading to Lindsey in about an hour to check out a boat.  I know its a drive (3hours) just to see a boat that I haven't seen yet, but its worth giving it a try.  Its a 14' with a 15 four stroke on the back for $3000.  My mindset is that if it doesn't feel right I'm heading home empty handed."
941517,porkpie,2015-10-24 16:03:00,2521,In Lindsay your should be able to arrange a water test.  Remember there will always be another deal.  Good luck.
941548,Sinker,2015-10-24 17:44:00,8692,I think it will feel right. Its a good looking rig.  S.
941569,Steve,2015-10-24 18:35:00,2075,"sounds like a good starter rig. I know the water you fish bud, and it'll fit your needs perfectly.  if it can't be water tested, see if you can get in writing that the boat is leak free.  that'll at least allow you some recourse in the spring if it leaks like a sieve.  I believe it was mentioned it was a starcraft? They are likely the best aluminum boat manufacturer out there right now....I'm sure it'll be rock solid!  Good luck bud!"
941612,Big Cliff,2015-10-24 22:36:00,6899,"I'm anxious to hear how it went. Water test shouldn't be a problem, there is a boat launch right across the street."
941621,LostAnotherOne,2015-10-25 00:30:00,956,"Just got back.  Almost 7 hours driving today.  Anyways we tested the boat and its great.  No leaks and motor runs well.  The problem is when we hooked up there was no electrical.  Cant drive on the 401 with no trailer lights at night time.  The good thing is that he's going to take it into the shop to get fixed.  Was hoping to bring it back today, but I may have to wait until next week.  The electrical stuff is not the problem I'm worried about, but the fact that he doesn't have ownership for the trailer.  He's got a receipt that I'm going to bring into Service Ontario on Monday to see if they can accept that.  The seller is very nice and knowledgeable about musky.  When he started showing me all his pics I was embarrassed to show him my 44"" I caught last year.  If anyone can give me advice on how to deal with this issue with ownership that would be greatly appreciated.  I also couldn't see the Hull number on the side of the boat.  I really want this boat."
941623,leaf4,2015-10-25 00:41:00,2466,"Can't help with the hull numbers, but the trailer should be able to be registered as a home made one."
941625,irishfield,2015-10-25 00:52:00,26272,"Sounds like trying to buy something from my father in law. No excuse for not having a trailer ownership... if his plate is legit just get him to go to service Ontario and get a replacement ownership.  The first thing cops ask for now when they pull you over is trailer ownership and sometimes boat ownership. A good thing to try and deter stolen boats from travelling the highway. Everyone on this forum should have the trailer ownership in their vehicle glove box and the boat ownership in it's glove box.  As for numbers on the boat, again vessel licence is mandatory to have on board the vessel. He should have it!  If he can't produce either, walk away."
941636,porkpie,2015-10-25 02:23:00,2521,"He can get a replacement ownership for the trailer at service ontario without trouble.  If the boat has a serial number, you can do a cpic check online to check for stolen.  It's not a flawless system, but it will give you some idea.  Serials on boats are typically located near the rear grab handles on tinnys.  You can usually register a boat with a sworn affidavit.  Most towns have a commissioner of oaths that for $20 or so will commission something for you to send in to register the hull.  In short, it's not impossible, but requires more legwork.  Here is the link to cpic  http://app.cpic-cipc.ca/English/search.cfm"
941638,Sinker,2015-10-25 02:55:00,8692,"What porkpie said... its a bit of paper work but I believe its a great boat for the price. A replacement ownership is no big deal, I just did one. Service ontario will hook him up easy.  Nice boat though, eh?  S."
941640,Big Cliff,2015-10-25 07:44:00,6899,I don't know Jim well but from my experience with him he is a very nice man and I am sure he will get his side of it all sorted out for you!
941641,LostAnotherOne,2015-10-25 09:52:00,956,Its a really nice boat that's for sure.  I'm hoping to get it all cleared up on Monday.  Will keep you posted.  Thanks guys

942849,Big Cliff,2015-11-01 09:43:00,6899,"Congratulations, looks like you got a super deal!  I was kind of wondering what was happening because I saw the other boat sitting at Jim's but in a shelter."
942853,Roy,2015-11-01 10:43:00,13728,"Congrats on a great purchase, Jeff. It should be a super season for you."

941126,LostAnotherOne,2015-10-22 20:19:00,956,"This will be my first boat and I have a cap of $3000.  Cant get anything pretty but looking for a 14' aluminum with hopefully a 4 stroke, but most likely it will be a 2 stroke.  My question for you guys is when is the best time of the year to get it?  I keep saying spring, but would it be smart to grab one now.  Thanks"
941127,mukluk,2015-10-22 20:40:00,196,"I would say ""jump on buying one now in the off season"".  Might get a better deal as some may not want to pay storage or winterizing fee etc."
941129,irishfield,2015-10-22 20:45:00,26272,"Buying a boat in the Spring is about as smart as buying a sled in December! Issue is most guys know that and even though they plan to sell they won't do so until Spring when there's an open, higher priced, market for their boat. Buy now...."
941131,jtracc,2015-10-22 20:46:00,97,"Well, the more expensive and bigger the boat the better the deal. End of season would be your best bet.  A 14 ft tin is not that hard to store and not that hard to sell.  Where as a larger boat like a bass boat or deep v takes up space and money to store so the faster the seller can get rid of it the better.  If I was selling my tin boat my price wouldn't be that flexible as I can sell it any time.  I store in my back yard upside down on the trailer, easy.  My 18 ft crestliner takes up my garage, plus I have to plug in all my batties....  Keep your eyes peeled and ear to the ground, you'll find a deal."
941132,steelhunter,2015-10-22 20:49:00,81,Kijiji has tonnes of boats for sale right now If you wait till spring it will be late June before you get one
941133,Joeytier,2015-10-22 20:52:00,3990,Yep!  Start looking now.  3 grand this time of year gets you a very decent rig.
941134,wkrp,2015-10-22 20:58:00,656,Lawn mowers in the fall. Snowblowersin the spring. Same applies to boats.

941159,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-22 23:39:00,10439,Now is the time to buy. The hard part is sitting in your boat in the garage all winter pretending you're out on the lake!!!!
941162,porkpie,2015-10-22 23:43:00,2521,"Buy this if the motor is decent.  I have an SF14 starcraft as my duckboat with a 20, and it's a solid boat.  I ran it previously with a 15, and it's just fine for fishing.  The only time you want more power is carrying heavy decoy rigs for duck hunting.  To answer the original question, buy now if you have the cash."
941172,MCTFisher9120,2015-10-23 00:25:00,3761,"Spring you will find more options but you will pay more money. Fall is the time to find a deal as guys that are ""done"" won't want to bother winterizing/storing there old rig. I just found a boat this week similar to what you are looking for. 14' with a 2-stroke and I came in well under your budget. Spring I got work to do re doing floors and carpet but that's part of the ""deal""  Good luck in your search!"
941181,LostAnotherOne,2015-10-23 01:10:00,956,Thanks guys for the advice.  I decided I'm going to act now instead of spring so hopefully I can get it out for some November musky.

This is what i did last fall...ended up getting a sweet boat for a good price and managed to get out and catch a few musky before the season ended.  Go for it!

Its just down the rd from big cliff......nice deep and wide tinny. Just sayin.....asking $3000   S. Is that the one down across the road from Lunge Haven? I went down there but there is no sign or or anything on the boat, (was on a black trailer) tried knocking on the door but no one answered, I'll try again this evening. I did go out to 36 and down the other way to Pleasent Point but the only other one I saw didn't have a motor on it and it looked like it needed a lot of TLC."

Very decent boat he has already painted it, and redid the carpeting said that cost him just over 300.00.... Now if the wind would ever die down when he is off we might get out fishing in it before the snow flies."

941501,moxie,2015-10-24 15:06:00,1566,When most are hanging up the fishing gear and later. Would be better served if you can test it on the water as testing an outboard in a driveway wont tell you how it will perform on the water and tough to tell if there are and leaks in the hull. Good luck.
