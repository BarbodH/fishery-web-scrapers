940477,Spiel,2015-10-19 11:14:00,9065,"Thanks again guys.   Any idea on how scratch resistant the acrylic is?  It does appear Mike as though it'll scuff easily. I made the owner aware of this before putting it all together. He's not worried as he travels with a pouch over rod and reel at all times with of course the exception of when he's fishing. As for treating scuffs and scratches, I have a few ideas to try if needed."

940544,Fish Farmer,2015-10-19 19:08:00,2234,"Might be able to wash the minnow scales off easier than cork. I'd be worried about the fish slim on my hands from, Sheephead, Catfish, and the rest, rod would fly out of my hand. Look nicer with a black spinning reel, Mitchell 300 comes to mind. Another masterpiece, one of a kind You seem to out do yourself bud"

942636,FloatnFly,2015-10-30 23:49:00,1640,  It's doable.       hehe im scared of the cost....... lol  I hear you're building a rod for a mutual friend though
942663,spinnerdoc,2015-10-31 03:18:00,556,  The owner I heard is very careful of his gear so we need not  worry of scratches â˜ºStellar as always my friend ?
940222,Spiel,2015-10-17 20:09:00,9065,"A friend of mine approached me over a year ago with a vision. He had an idea for a rod to play up the beauty of his custom RSG Vyper reel.We discussed many things and I agreed to take on the project though it had me working in 2 new mediums, that being carbon fiber grips and acrylic components.There were issues sourcing all the needed components but I finally had all in hand this past August and set about practicing and destroying some of the new materials.In the end I'm happy with the results, it's not perfect but it was a most enjoyable adventure from routine.Roughing out the acrylic seat....          Checking the now fitted hood/grip to the seat for a perfect fit....    All dry fit on a threaded mandrel for a first look at the concept....      Now almost ready to battle Steelhead. The tip section still needs winding finish.The details.....11' 6"" CTS in clear glossCarbon Fiber/foam core gripsAcrylic reel seat/butt cap and trim piecesLemke LC24 black hardwareLiquid black winding checkBlack nylon windings with metallic black trim bands (visible in sunlight)Fuji BYAG guides chosen for being all black....

940225,misfish,2015-10-17 20:17:00,29133,"TIFA Chris  I hope your wearing a mask doing that carbon.  It,s black magic.  My only question is grip? Sliding in the hand.  I really like the look dude.  Great job.  I have not seen the vyper ? Who sells it? Or is it a promo reel?"
940226,misfish,2015-10-17 20:24:00,29133,Never mind. just enlarged noticed 2/12

940242,Canuck2fan,2015-10-17 21:07:00,1444,"Always enjoy seeing what an artisan can create...  Can I ask what does the entire rod weigh, without a reel?"
940245,Spiel,2015-10-17 21:18:00,9065,"Thanks guys.     My only question is grip? Sliding in the hand.   One would think so Brian but I've wet tested it in house and it's not slippery. Mind you I didn't add any roe goo to my hands.   Always enjoy seeing what an artisan can create...  Can I ask what does the entire rod weigh, without a reel?  I weighed the entire rod at 200 grams, with the tip section coming in at a whopping 22 grams."

940444,Spiel,2015-10-18 21:29:00,9065,Thanks again all. The goal with custom obviously is to provide to the customer with what the customer desires. This time I moved way out of my comfort zone but I along with the customer are pleased with the results.  I through some research believe this to be a first ever (near) seamless marrying of the handle and reel seat in these materials. I previously did do the same in wood and cork for this customer and I believe that was also a first(?).
940453,GBW,2015-10-18 23:20:00,8460,I honestly think the RSG Vyper reel company should be using that for an ad! Great work!
940456,aplumma,2015-10-18 23:50:00,6896,Can you make me one for the 9mm round please.  Very well done as all the rods I am lucky enough to own and the ones I get to see. The tips you have graciously give me over the years on wood finishing has turned my knife handles into works of art. . Art

940458,MJL,2015-10-19 00:06:00,2427,"Nicely done Chris. It's definitely not my style as you know, but I'm really liking how the rod and reel came together as 1 theme. Any idea on how scratch resistant the acrylic is?"
940461,solopaddler,2015-10-19 00:33:00,8605,Any idea on how scratch resistant the acrylic is?  Give it to me for a week and I'll let everybody know.
