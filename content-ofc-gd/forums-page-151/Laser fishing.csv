943481,DanD,2015-11-05 15:08:00,2223,I wonder if that would fall under the reg of not using artificial light to attract fish? Be neat to try in the fish hut this winter; might be able to start a perch feeding frenzy. LOL  Dan.

If catch and release angling is not harassing wildlife I seriously doubt this would be."
