My 3 destinations include Balsam lake, Lake St. Clair, and Long Point Bay.  I have a buddy joining me for Balsam so SW Ont. is open.  Based on the current forecast it will be LSC on Monday and LP on Tuesday.  I simply ask that you bring the appropriate Musky specific equipment (I have the net!), pay half the gas (boat and tow), and a winning attitude!  Also, I don't allow alcohol on the boat.  All the best!  Patrick."
