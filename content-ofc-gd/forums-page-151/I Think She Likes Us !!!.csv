But for those that have not seen my previous reports about this fish I will give you a quick run down . A small group of friends and I fish a fairly large backwoods lake in north/central Ontario a couple times each year ( love to fish it more but just too hard to get there )  Anyways starting in 2011 and continuing to this year we have caught the same lake trout out of the same bay 5 years in a row . The fish is identified by a small scar on its side and a small deformity on its tail . I have contacted the MNR about this and they can't believe it . They also advised me that this fish is a very old fish ,  25 years old if not older !  I have never heard of anything like this before especially a lake trout . I have heard stories of a musky or bass being caught 2 or 3 times but never 5 times . Incredible/lucky story if you ask me . Here are the pictures everyone , enjoy             For those people that say catch and release doesn't work on deep water lake trout , I would have to disagree Cheers all  "

942113,manitoubass2,2015-10-28 04:22:00,11391,5 times thats just rediculous!!!!  Awesome stuff man!!!
942117,wormdunker,2015-10-28 10:09:00,1711,Wow!  So C&R is alive & well.

942132,NAW,2015-10-28 12:24:00,4022,What's her name?
942134,Sinker,2015-10-28 12:49:00,8692,"That's impressive for sure! Pretty cool! You'd think it would learn to not bite, eh? LOL   S."
942148,Steelheadphycho,2015-10-28 13:41:00,470,That's cool! What would be crazier is if you caught her on the same lure every year!
942209,misfish,2015-10-28 19:41:00,29133,"5 times thats just rediculous!!!!  Awesome stuff man!!!   When it,s the only one in the lake, of course your going to catch it 5 times.LOL  Thats amazing"
942216,JoshS,2015-10-28 20:17:00,729,Neat stuff! You gotta keep that streak going!  What a great catch and release story to tell people.
942482,jtracc,2015-10-30 00:14:00,97,"That's funny Dave.  What are the odds, nice to see he goes back every year.  Nice job looks like a nice lake!  I'd like to try and catch Luke the laker one these years..."

Lots of people say this chris and it obviously is not the case . Live release works . This fish is a jig fish and its coming out of 50 ft of water during the warmest water period (August/September) We tend to not bring them up too fast and try not to fight them hard around the boat (thats when they stress) As well as a quick picture . I'm not going to lie but one of those times my friend dropped the fish in the bottom of the boat and it went under the seat and we couldn't get it out for a bit , we thought she was a gonner but wouldn't you know it she slowly swam away and returned to our boat this past August alive and well . These fish are more resilient then you think even when you unfortunately don't practice ""good live release"" at times  This is a natural lake trout lake chris . Wow!  So C&R is alive & well.  Sure does !!! That's impressive for sure! Pretty cool! You'd think it would learn to not bite, eh? LOL   S.  Not to many people fish this lake so they don't see many lures That's cool! What would be crazier is if you caught her on the same lure every year! Actually we do , this is a jig fish coming out of 50 ft of water every time"

Not really .  That's funny Dave. What are the odds, nice to see he goes back every year. Nice job looks like a nice lake! I'd like to try and catch Luke the laker one these years...  Thanks Joe , ya maybe get you in there next year ! Two words of advice.  Lotto Tickets!  I have been told that a couple times That's excellent and congratulations, and as someone else suggested it certainly shows that C&R works.  My best was a musky I caught 3 times in one season and another was a musky I caught twice in a weekend. Sure does Lew , sounds like you have a couple C&R stories yourself  Judging by the way you/your friends are dressed in the pictures, that fish likes that bay all year round! Have never caught it on our annual spring trip , just in August and September !"
942668,Joeytier,2015-10-31 05:23:00,3990,"That's pretty amazing.  Judging by the big old looking head and relatively small body, he's probably about maxed out for size eh?"
942719,ehg,2015-10-31 17:41:00,2666,"That's crazy! Five times same fish, year after year.  Did similar post back a decade or so about a musky i caught twice years apart... http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=223  It would be really something if you caught that fish again!"
