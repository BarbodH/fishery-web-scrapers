Steelheading in southern ontario tribs in the spring, and lots of pics from working for the better part of spring, summer, and fall on the Attawapiskat River at Eddie Norths.  Did some early season guiding at Windsor Lake, and then working at main camp at Beteau.  What a great experience it was!!! I've been going here for 4 straight years, the first 2 as a guest and the last 2 working.   It's hard to put in to words what this place means to me.  So many great adventures, memories and friendships made.  Demanding, challenging and rewarding are the adjectives I'd use to describe the experience.  Not to mention some of the best fishing I've seen yet, it's been a great year.  Caught my pb steelhead this spring,  as well as my pb walleye  and my first sturgeon  Can't wait to get back!!!!    "

941969,Sandbag,2015-10-27 13:11:00,533,"Awesome slide show Matt.  Congrats on a great year. With all the hand-feeding of the animals I saw, I half expected to see one with a bear or a moose eating out of your hand.  Great picture and tune.  Cheers  Craig"

942286,crappieperchhunter,2015-10-29 01:46:00,2582,Thx for sharing I enjoyed that. Did your pet groundhog come home with you or is he still up there...lol.

Did your pet groundhog come home with you or is he still up there...lol. I think he reached the end of the road. He disappeared in the middle of the summer.  He'd been there for at least 4 years.  We named him Jack because he once drank a guests unattended jack and coke and then passed out on the grass for about 2 hours lol  Pretty cool ground hog, he would sometimes wake me up by scratching on my cabin door in the morning and he would come inside and we would share a granola bar."

Great story. After that you would absolutely have to call him Jack  I have a crow at the cottage that I share my mornings with. I do a few sudoku puzzles on the porch with my morning coffee and I have a bag of peanuts to share with him. Started out he wouldn't come within 30 feet of me to grab a peanut. By the end of the summer he was within 5 feet. I'm hoping he is around next summer and I can eventually feed him by hand."
