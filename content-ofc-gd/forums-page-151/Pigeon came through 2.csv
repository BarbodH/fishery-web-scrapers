943373,SylvanOwner,2015-11-04 20:35:00,266,Nice fish Jimmer!  If you're thinking about a GoPro but don't want to pay out the big bucks check out SJ CAM 4000.  Good luck on the water.
943378,Fisherpete,2015-11-04 21:13:00,1814,Nicely done!  I have a simple camera setup that works very well for me in my boat - will take a pic and post for you.  Pete

943461,jimmer,2015-11-05 13:51:00,2730,Thanks for the camera idea guys!
943463,AKRISONER,2015-11-05 13:56:00,5558,"nice job, that water looks cold!"
943471,lew,2015-11-05 14:35:00,12766,"Here's a very simple and cheap camera mount jimmer and one that works very well. Just a wooden dowel the same size as a seat post hole in your deck and build a little box on top. Set the camera in the box and when your ready to lift  the fish out of the net, hit the timer & smile.    With a bit of practice you can get pretty decent pictures when your alone in the boat.  "
