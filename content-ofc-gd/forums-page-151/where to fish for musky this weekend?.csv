943711,2 tone z71,2015-11-07 04:27:00,1311,How far you wanna drive ...try Britt hwy 526 ..you don't have to go far from the launch and if there willing there usually decent size
943712,irishfield,2015-11-07 04:29:00,26272,"Water is back to normal median on GBay, so no need for docks at launch. Midland has a board walk beside the launch and with that said as of Wednesday the dock beside it was still in. You are in need of a parking permit if you have a trailer though, but not sure anyone actually checks this time of year."
943717,mikeh,2015-11-07 04:54:00,824,the launch at Muskies Landing is pretty good and if it gets rough there are lots of sheltered areas to fish.(not sure if they still have there docks in)
943732,Rizzo,2015-11-07 14:00:00,4754,"another vote for Britt...haven't been there since we moved away from Barrie, nice spot and some King Kong muskies"
