Stuffed turkey burgers with mutza. First, I halfed some red bells and grilled them on the BBQ,along with some Portabello mushrooms and a full globe of garlic. 20 minutes on the grill and I brought them in. Diced and sliced the mushroom and pepper and squeesed out the garlic gloves.What a sweet smell.Put in a pot together and simmers to a thick chutny for 2 hours.You can add some spice if you like.    Time to mix up the 1 pound of ground turkey,savory,pepper, salt and scallions.Mix  it all together,let stand in the fridge for an hour. Remove then split into four patties. Add some mutza to the pattie, and cover and pinch the edges.    While the wife is cooking up her famous whole grain tuna salad,I thew the burgers on the grill for 25 minutes on med/high. While they were cooking away,I had time to fix up our flowers and garden friends.        Picked up this bug eyed guy today.Very cool I think.    Oh dinners ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Got to go.   Hope you enjoyed as WE DID.  Oh the chutny was the topping for the turkey burgers.Just incase ya didnt know.LOL"
