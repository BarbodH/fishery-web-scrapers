336870,smokin joe,2009-05-01 01:40:00,226,"I had rumatory authrities when I was 15 due to a broken knee that I didn't know about.  Went through a couple of years of knee drains once a week with a needle (talk about pain!!)  Anyway I went in for surgury and had it shaved, haven't had a problem since except for the fact that you can tell when the rain and cold weather's coming"
336919,workwear,2009-05-01 06:06:00,592,all the best to your wife dave.........   im sure itll all work itself out...     cheers peter
337459,tinbanger,2009-05-03 02:15:00,1028,"well in at 9 am for the procedure Surgeon walks in and after review of the MRI thinks that there is no tear in the cartilige but suggest the scoping would still be a good idea. No tears , ACL ok But lots of inflammation and fluid Few hours later we are on our way home.  Very painfull but the painkillers seem to be working ok.  will have to wait the outcome of the blood tests for more info. He is suspecting Lupus .. will know more in 4-5 days .    TB"
337462,pigeonfisher,2009-05-03 02:28:00,696,Well...I just looked up lupus as I didn't know what it was.  Seems like it can be dealt with.  Hope all is well and recovery is quick.
337469,tinbanger,2009-05-03 02:39:00,1028,"yes we did the smae and spoke with our pharmisist as well.  always a bit scarey when anything is followed by the word 'disease'  combination of diet ,exercise and drugs will help ... IF that is what it is.    TB"
337639,moose,2009-05-03 19:22:00,266,"i had mine scope had a double bucket tear of the meniscous . scope friday umpired slo-pitch sunday night witha cane, drove tractor trailor monday morning,all depends on pain tolerance and how fast you want to recover the recovery is to move it to make it work, and have ice pacs ready for rest time"
337668,dobee,2009-05-03 20:54:00,301,"i had my meniscus surgery in september... there will be minimal movements for a few weeks... just do the stretches and excercises they tell you too every day and she will be back to normal in no time...  my tear was a ""bucket handle tear"" which apart from completely tearing the muscle is one of the worse ones...the only problem i have right now is i cant fully bend my knee 100%... so no crouching... its about 85% right now... and getting better everyday..   good luck!"
336544,tinbanger,2009-04-30 03:38:00,1028,"My wife injured her knee late this winter and is scheduled for a scoping tomorrow.   Any idea of what she can expect post surgury and tips to help speed her recovery ? keeping her off it will be the key ...and difficult  On a side note , a thumbs up for the Medical system. Saw the Specialist on Monday , MRI tuesday night , surgury Thursday .....  TB"
336545,Raf,2009-04-30 03:44:00,3495,"what happened to her knee?  i tore my anterior cruciate ligament (inside of knee).  unfortunately, it did take a long time to heal but i was able to get around with a knee brace that kept the leg/knee locked."
336547,tinbanger,2009-04-30 03:51:00,1028,She has a tear in the Meniscus (sp) cartiliage .resulting in her knee being in a locked position. Good news is there appears to be no Ligiment damage and the cartilage was not folded over into the joint .  TB
336549,Fudd,2009-04-30 04:00:00,94,If it is just a scope.. 7-10 days nps and she will be back to normal...it they play around in there it takes a bit longer. I have had both my knees reco'd and like 4 scopes.. running on artifical turf for the lose
336550,bigfish1965,2009-04-30 04:03:00,3382,Had my meniscus shaved 15 years back..felt like a new knee within 4 or 5 days. No problems since.
336551,HTHM,2009-04-30 04:05:00,4082,"That sounds dirty, but it's not....."
336552,Raf,2009-04-30 04:06:00,3495,i hope the surgery goes well tb.  i can't offer advice as my case was different - that knee is a pretty complicated piece of us. the doctor told me the 'good' news was that I didn't appear to damage the meniscus and could likely avoid surgery.  recovery for me was in the vicinity of 7-8 wks.
336554,tinbanger,2009-04-30 04:08:00,1028,"hoping for the best , the Dr seemed to indicate a week to 10 day recovery but I'm sure we will know better after complete. TB"
336564,Greencoachdog,2009-04-30 04:35:00,8163,"  Yeah, a week to 10 days is more realistic... aboot 3 weeks to full recovery.  It's more or less a piece of cake, the first 3 or 4 days are ""tender""... after that it gets a lot better!!!  One of the best things I ever did was to have my knee scoped!!!"
336580,walleyemen,2009-04-30 09:28:00,316,"Best thing is a day or so after surjury, start walking on it,, i had the same thing, knee locked up, tore the meniscus 60 %, recovery is longer than you might think, feels better, but you still have some discomfort, never 100% again."
336582,Gerry,2009-04-30 09:50:00,257,"The scope itself is not that big of a deal but get her to walk on it ASAP and get physiotherapy. I have a torn ACL (3 yrs ago) and so my problem is a bit different but I had a scope 2 years ago and getting the 2nd one soon. I was back at work in 3 days when I had the 1st one, albeit it was still tender but a week later I was pretty good. It depends how much cutting and twisting of the knee that they have to do. In my case I was on the table for quite a while because when the ACL popped it did a lot of damage to the meniscus. In my case I thought the general anesthetic was the worst. I still have to wear a huge brace because of the ACL."
336583,pikehunter,2009-04-30 09:51:00,1659,"I was wondering the same thing, if or how many on the board have had this done? I'm scheduled to go in on May 21st for the same procedure and for the same reason. The surgeon told me that time off work could be maybe 6 weeks or even 2 months however that depends on how strenuous the patients job is. How much walking, twisting, lifting, time on your feet etc. Since I'm on my feet all day twisting, lifting, walking, stretching pushing, pulling, climbing ladders he told me to expect maybe 6 weeks  He did not mention how soon that the pain or ability to get around would take except that I may need crutches for maybe 4 days after.  No problem I said....pickerel season will be just beginning!  This is really fast for your wife, I thought that I ran through the system pretty quickly, about 6 or so weeks from my first doctor visit to the day of procedure and this was stated by the people I work with. Day 1 family doctor, day2 surgeon and x-ray, day 10 MRI, then booked in for the arthroscope in May.  I wish her well"
336588,ricoboxing,2009-04-30 11:16:00,398,"i've had my knee scoped 3 times for the same problem. you can walk on it the same day, just a little tender. a week later you should be able to start doing light exercise to strengthen the muscles surrounding the knee. the sooner you start doing physio or strengthening to it, the faster you'll recover. lots of ice helps alot too."
336597,Gerritt,2009-04-30 11:44:00,6129,"I have had both knees scoped.. my right one three times. each time I was up and back to normal in about a week... sure there was still a bit of tenderness though.. the important thing for me was to keep it mobile,  It still gives me fits from time to time... normally when bad weather is coming I feel a bit sore.  G"
336599,pikehunter,2009-04-30 11:46:00,1659, Sooooooooo then....you are a better predictor of foul weather than the weather channel!
336600,FLEX ROD,2009-04-30 11:57:00,394,"Tinbanger,  Good luck to your wife, you have had a lot of great info here as one that has had his right knee scoped 4 times and left knee done now 2 times and waiting for number 3 I will put my 2 cents in.  Scoping the meniscus is not a big thing, the two most painfull parts are the twisting of the knee so that the doc can get in from all angles, and the second is from the pressure cuff that they put on your thigh. Again I concure with what has been said, get her to start walking ASAP, and staight leg raises.  I hope that your wife's situations ends better than mine, as they left floaters in the knee and the first time aronud 10 days later with doctors permission after me rehabing the knee to death I was skiing with the family in Vermont, and that is probably what got the floaters moving faster and creating more damage hence the second surgery, which was in September.  Since then I have been going to physio 3 times a week doing my own thing ice and I have hade 4 injections into the knee of Durolane a silicone for lubrication and I got a good brace and the last thing and basically the only thing that has helped Accupunctur.  Today I am finally off the cane last week but still wearing the brace and my knee is still sore my surgon does not have a clue what is wrong and does not now what to do so I am waiting for a referal to a new surgon as the only thing that I will execpt is for it to be scoped again by a new set of eyes, as MRI is good but MRI does not show all and with the knee being what it is I really need it fixed.  The above mentioned things should help your wife a truelly GOOD LUCK, and keep us posted.  FLEX"
336610,Bitsmith2k,2009-04-30 12:41:00,396,no worries about a meniscus scope.. i had it done about 10 years ago walked out of the hospital and took it easy on it for about a week..
336612,holdfast,2009-04-30 12:48:00,1813,"Yup I had a torn Meniscus (sp) cartilage that was operated on in 2004, from what I remembered I crouched out of the hospital the same day.  Walked without crutches within a couple of days.  Running in a couple of weeks.   To this day however there are times when the knee still hurts.  But that may be due to a sore Hip.  As a matter of fact the whole Leg including the Ankle that I busted and had it set with screws.  However I still run and don't use pain killers.  Of note though, for the last couple of months it hasn't been bad as I guess weight loss also helped.  As a Side note.  As far as the Knee was concerned, I just happened to notice it was sore when I was exercising on my own.  Limped it for a year then reported it to the military Doctor.  I tried to get Veterans comp for it, but was turned down because I was told I didnt suffer Trauma.  Meaning I guess jumped in a ditch with my Rucksack on and then noticed it.  I should of lied.  Any Brain Dead Idiot would know it was due to Military duty as WEAR and TEAR.    Just curious on how your Wife ripped it."
336709,outdoorguy61,2009-04-30 17:45:00,220,"I have stretched the ligaments in my knee too many times to remember.  Having had my knee scoped once, I have had nothing but good things to say. That said, it has changed things for me a lot, and I now lead what to me is a fairly docile life, compared to running, playing hockey, etc. Recovery time was very quick following my surgery, with me weakly walking within a couple of days. This was now nine years ago.  I still miss running and playing hockey, but feel the risk is too high. Hopefully I will resume walks, backpacking and perhaps riding my bike. All have sadly taken a backseat.  I wish your wife well.  outdoorguy61"
336740,addy79,2009-04-30 19:48:00,573,"i tore my acl and cartilage playin hockey, most painful injury OF ALL TIME!! trust  me!  your supposed to keep it relatively mobilized before and after surgery...i had to pay about $400 for a brace that limited the range of movement but did let me swing it a bit...  i was on cruches for over ten weeks though and physio for bout 6 months...  they will zap her knee once or twice a knee to stimulate the muscles since she wont be able to do much on it, this way it avoids muscle atrophy  wish her all the best and a speedy recovery, and DO STAY ACTIVE/MOBILE for a speedy recovery"
336760,desship,2009-04-30 20:34:00,96,"Hat both knees scoped twice each.First three were fine ,the last one got infected off work 19 months still having problems 7 years later.Too young for knee replacement. Trying laser therapy for scar tissue and arthritis in shoulder if it works I'll try it on knee.  Good luck,listen to doctor and do the therapy after surgery."
336764,justin elia,2009-04-30 20:40:00,151,"Had my knee scoped in August.  Had a 2/3 torn ACL, manicus damage and they had to shave some build up on my bone.  Brutal recovery, still dealing with it.  As for just a torn maniscus, if its not a bad injury, she'll be up and walking in a few days.  Every body is different, and every injury is different."
336767,tinbanger,2009-04-30 20:42:00,1028,Thanks for all the best wishes and advice .Sounds like following directions for a smooth recovery is the key.  Bad news is surgeury has been pushed to Saturday  For the inquiring minds it was a couple of falls in the driveway late in the winter and a bad encounter with a patio umbrella  ( don't ask)  TB
336840,salmon,2009-05-01 00:13:00,334, I have had my knee scoped out ages ago. Knee was locking up until they went in and cleaned it out and removed some loose debris. But I ruptured my ACL and they reattached both the loose ends. A couple of small incisions with a bit of swelling. Jose
336865,HTHM,2009-05-01 01:25:00,4082,OK now I'm askin'
