I called sandboy and oldcut and they dont start renting until the may long weekend. So if you know any other places that rent, let me know.  Im almost considering renting a canoe, the water shouldnt be too bad."

One thing I can say is that there's still plenty of bay to fish once the sanctuary kicks in.  And though the pike fishing is better during the ice out season you can still get them all summer long.  There's a solid resident population .  Cheers, UF"
