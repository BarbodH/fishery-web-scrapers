337691,JeffBornFishin,2009-05-03 22:21:00,260,I heard a few days ago that a large dock had broken loose and was floating around Chemong south of the Causeway.  Was out driving across the causeway today and I can confirm that it is in fact very large and floating around south of the causeway.  There is no way you would see this at night.  Keep a good watch if you are out there.
337692,frozen-fire,2009-05-03 22:25:00,542,Thanks for the heads up. Good on you for warning others on this forum
337695,irishfield,2009-05-03 22:28:00,26272,Thanks Jeff... I would hope that some caring boater would tie onto it and pull it to shore.
337700,JeffBornFishin,2009-05-03 22:32:00,260, That would be a tough task...this thing appears to be bigger than a large patio boat or two.
337701,irishfield,2009-05-03 22:35:00,26272,Tie to bow.. pull backwards for steering control. Could be done with a 9.9

337790,skeeter,2009-05-04 01:03:00,1907,thanks for the heads up.. i have a triler at baileys bay if its still out there next weekend i will pull it to shore. its only a 15 ' mirrorcraft with an older 20 merc but it should do the trick. hell if its a good piece i just might take it down to baileys bay and use it .....lol
