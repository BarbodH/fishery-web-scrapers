Sunny skies, birds a chirpin, a cool breeze and lots of fish.  I started off tossing a float out on my ultralite, hoping for some perch. Figured that would give me time to  set up a bottom rig on the uglystick.. That little task ended up taking over 20 minutes. 4 cookie cutter cats in that space of time all 1-2 lb size.   Finally got the heavier rod rigged and line out with cut bait to catch some more kitties   It was a great afternoon. Fish biting every 10-15 minutes. The place all to myself except for the birds, and a few came to visit. The blackbird was oblivious to me sitting there.   This heron just kept getting closer and closer. Don't have the greatest zoom so the pics are a bit blurry.    Big fish of the day was another fat carp. They seem to like the cut bait at the moment. I don't often hear of lamprey striking carp, but the big hole on this carp's belly sure looks like it.   Just another wonderful afternoon."

337447,ccmtcanada,2009-05-03 01:40:00,7971,Looked like a great day out there!  Some nice fish!
337453,bigugli,2009-05-03 01:47:00,6138, How so?  I would think quickly beached on wet sand is preferable to being tangled up in a net or put up on dry ground. Minimum handling
337457,fish_finder,2009-05-03 02:00:00,370," Rolling around in the gravel probably isn't the best place for em.....its one thing to lift em up out of the water for a second or two to get a shot, but on the ground like that, dry or wet....not a good idea man.  I'm not trying to criticize buddy.....just trying to educate.  There are countless articles written about proper catch and release techiniques....that ain't one of em!  And yes, a soft material net left in the water would be more preferable."
