337287,Sandbag,2009-05-02 13:19:00,533,"Can't really help you with Kings this time of year, but you won't have to go to far from the harbour for Browns.  You will likely see several people trolling the mud line where the water changes clarity.  That is a good spot to start   Cheers  Craig"
337301,Squid,2009-05-02 15:28:00,1656,"Don't be shy, get in close to shore 12-15 ft of water, long line blue white raps and other colors , jointed or sticks, 8inch baits. They could also be out in 20-30 feet. make sure you have plenty of line on your rod. If you hook into a 25lb king he/she will take you for a ride if you are using a spinning reel with 12LB test. As mentioned, there could be a mudline but I have caught fish inside the mudline too. Trolling at 2-2.5 mph and good luck to you."

337638,wolfmachine,2009-05-03 19:19:00,89,"i'm not too sure about the baitfish....  my graph didn't stop marking fishing all day, so i'm sure there are lots there"
