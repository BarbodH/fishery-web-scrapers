It takes that long for news to get there. Watch out for SARS in Sask.  By the way, everyone in the U.S. and Canada are going to die."
337419,Cudz,2009-05-03 00:47:00,2652,that is a fact.  Everyone will die
337440,keram,2009-05-03 01:24:00,585,"very simple way to prevent the flu, just follow WHO guidelines   Make sure you get your daily dose of fruits and veggies.Take your vitamins and get plenty of exercise because exercise helps build your immune system. Walk for at least hour a day, go for a swim, take the stairs instead of the elevator, etc. Wash your hands often. If you can't wash them, keep a bottle of antibacterial stuff around. Get lots of fresh air. Open windows whenever possible. Get plenty of rest. Try to eliminate as much stress from your life as you can. You can take the doctors office approach. Think about it, when you go for a shot, what do they do first? Clean your arm with alcohol. Why? Because alcohol kills germs.   So......   I walk to the liquor store (exercise), put lime in my Corona (fruit), celery in my Bloody Mary (veggies), drink on the bar patio (fresh air), get drunk, tell jokes, and laugh (eliminate stress) and then pass out (rest). The way I see it, if you keep your alcohol levels up flu virus can't get you"
337443,Greencoachdog,2009-05-03 01:32:00,8163,  I like the way you think!!!

337549,Ramble,2009-05-03 13:27:00,713," Speaking of drunk talk ""Read"" doesnt usually have a 3 in it LMAO.  Every 10 years or so a new flu strain makes the jump from critters to people. In a few years it'll just be another strain added to the list. Ther has be others which have jumped from pigs to people before. The spanish flu was from birds they think and if i remember correctly there was one that jumped from horses.  Only reason it is any concern is because it's different enough from the other that it catches the immune system off guard and infection occurs more rapidly and extensivly then most of the others. When the immune system does kick in it ""over reacts"" for what the body can handle. You end up with a lot of fluid in teh lungs and the damage to the lung tissue and fluid can result in death, or set you up for a secondary infection such an pneumonia which inturn can be fatal.  Most of us think ""Well i am not eldery or a child and i'm in good health."" When it comes to sever respiratory infections that is the recipe for for the most lung damage.  Anyway, it will be interesting to see how this thing plays out.  -Dave"
337550,Guest skeeter99,2009-05-03 13:31:00,0,"  that is not to bad actually  on any given year 200,000 are hospitalized with the flu and on average 36000 people die in the U.S.  cant find stats for canada but would be proportionate to U.S.  this swine flu is really getting stupid  no one in a first world country has died from it, the people in mexico who are dying are dirt poor and dont have access or can afford to go to the doctor and when they do it is to late  yes a 24 month old child died in texas i think but he was from mexico and died on U.S. soil  I was in subway the other day and a lady ordered a BLT and asked for no bacon she did not want to catch the swine flu, when I got up for my sub I asked for the ladies bacon since it was paid for"

337581,cram,2009-05-03 14:58:00,1733,"We'll see how this plays out.  I know no one not in mexico has died from it yet, but i also don't remember (in my lifetime) the world health organization freaking out like this.  Also know that the worst pandemic (1918) didn't kill many people on its first wave either (was the second flu season when it went nuts)...it only killed 2% of infected at its peak, and it ended up killing 50-100mm people (i have heard both #'s...not sure the difference btwn how they're counted).  I'm not saying this is the spanish flu or anything close...just saying that i don't think its ""nothing"" yet.    The normal flu may kill 35000 a year, but those that die are almost always elderly or the immune-compromised (i.e from AIDS).  If this one is killing young adults its very different."

337705,Greencoachdog,2009-05-03 22:44:00,8163,"... just in case y'all didn't do the math, they predict more Canadians to die per capita than Americans.  300 mil @16000 dead vs, 30 mil Canadians @4000 dead... that would be like predicting 40,000 Americans dead from the illness!!!   Do they not have faith in the Canadian Healthcare system?... or do they know that most Canadians don't go to the doctor like they should?"
