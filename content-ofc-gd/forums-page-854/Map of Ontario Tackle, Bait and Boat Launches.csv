If you cannot view the map above, plaese click the ""View Tackle/Bait/Boat Launch Map in a larger map.  If you would like to add a Tackle Shop, Bait Shop, or Boat Launch to the map please: 1) Post a Reply or Private Message me with the FULL address of the Store or Boat Launch with an optional breif description OR 2) If you would like to get involved with the project and update the map as things go, please send me a PRIVATE MESSAGE with your email address. You may need a GMail account, or you will have to register your existing email through Google (ex:hotmail, yahoo, ect).  Please avoid giving a review of the store (ex: Customer Service, High/Low Prices, ect). However try to include the following if you want: Hours, Contact Info, Products Carried, or the Cost of the Boat Launch.  Please DO NOT post any fishing spots!And yes I know, it probably starts off zoomed way in on Sault Ste. Marie.  Edit: I have most of the major tackle and bait stores up, so if anyone knows any of those smaller family owned stores please post the address. I also only have a few boat launches posted, so again if you know where one is just give a couple of streets around it and I should be able to find it. And thanks to people who have contributed!"

Ill check it out for you.  Sorry, I cant quite get it to work. I can only export waypoints to gps, not POIs. So basically it would be a pain in the arse to use on a gps. Checking out the map beforehand, and setting a waypoint on your gps is the only way."
