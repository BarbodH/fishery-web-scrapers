337737,Fishing 24/7,2009-05-03 23:47:00,709,whats the difference between a male and a female speckled trout?
337739,irishfield,2009-05-03 23:51:00,26272,Well one thinks about sex every 40 seconds and the other once a year....
337743,BillM,2009-05-03 23:54:00,17367,Males will be more brightly coloured closer to the spawning season.  They'll also develop a hooked jaw like most male trout do.
337756,kickingfrog,2009-05-04 00:19:00,8333, And being a char they spawn in the fall.
337778,BillM,2009-05-04 00:45:00,17367,"  Yes sir, you might be lucky enough to hook into a male right before the season closes.  I got one last year that had some amazing colours."
337798,rbaquial,2009-05-04 01:09:00,968,  LMAO!! Ur a Joker!  That was too hilarious!
337808,Guidofisherman,2009-05-04 01:27:00,206,"When they are young and smaller, I find it harder to tell, but when they get bigger and older, there are some distinguishing chasracteristics to look for. Here are a few photos to compare. Both were about 5 lbs. and caught in the same pool within one week of each other in June.  These are some of my generalizations and observations. Males:  *generally more colourful fins in the fall *more of a hump on the back *the lip plate extends past the eyes  in a more pronounced fashion * there is a kype developed closer to spawning  Females:  *more tapered, smaller head profile *occassionally can feel the eggs in the belly * usually tend to ""school"" more as males show up later for the big event. I guess we all do that.  Body shape is not necessarily a distinguishing characteristic as either sex can be long and lean like a lake trout or more of a football shape. By the way, the world record brook trout was a female."
337846,silverstreak,2009-05-04 02:15:00,146,Males I have caught tend to keep good color all yr long. 
337852,silverstreak,2009-05-04 02:18:00,146,Females tend to stay on the plain side....at least that is my belief. Both spec's hit tiny Riverstones. Cheers
