337665,JPD,2009-05-03 20:49:00,296,"Fast ""snaps"" of the rod is mostly used. Think of ripping your lure free from a weed. That's the kind of force you want to put behind it. Vary your cadence as well and figure out how aggressively they want it that day... it changes all the time."

337683,brifishrgy,2009-05-03 22:03:00,559,I like using the rip .. pause ... retrieve for a couple feet then repeat .. vary the amount of rips and lengh of pauses .. I get alot of hits on the 2-3 ft retrive .. I believe the bass think the minnow got injured by another bass freaked out then started swimming normally and they want to hammer it before it gets away

To me it,s something that cant be explained.Just jerk and twitch.Ya,ll get it."

337690,pike slayer,2009-05-03 22:19:00,1177,"i try different patterns and do and try different times for pauses till i find somthing that works well. there is no right or wrong way to fish a jerk bait, play with it and figure out what works for you."
337783,Garry2Rs,2009-05-04 00:54:00,1425,"Since different baits react/behave differently, you might want to try a short cast in shallow water where you can watch what is happening...A swimming pool would be great, but I guess it's too early for that...HAHAHA"
