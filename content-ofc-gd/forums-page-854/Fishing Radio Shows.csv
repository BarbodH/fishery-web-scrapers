337395,beertech,2009-05-03 00:00:00,118,All i know is I caught the fishing canada one a few weeks ago. It was pathertic it was a non stop comercial for their sponsors.   Interview with the owner of radio world then an interview with the castrol canada  people. Had very little to do with fishing.

337779,Mike Pike,2009-05-04 00:46:00,1332,Bob Izumi used to have these Real Fishing Show radio segments a few years ago that I heard at various times on various stations.  If you go onto their website you can replay them.  I dunno if they still make them though.  And I echo everyone's sentiments on the Outdoor Journal radio hour on the Fan 590.  I haven't listened to worse programming in my life!!!!!!!!!!!
