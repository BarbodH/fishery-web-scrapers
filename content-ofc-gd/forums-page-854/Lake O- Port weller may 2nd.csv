337922,rhare,2009-05-04 11:30:00,387,I was invited to fish a tourney this weekend with some friends of mine Al and Deanna from Spoonmaster. It was a beautiful day on the water and although the bite was a little slow we managed to put together a nice box. We ended up going 6/6 with one brown and 5 kings. We finished just outside the money but a couple pounds of course : 5 fish came off the swr and 1 off the 10 colour core. All on spoons. Biggest went 18lbs Fishing on Lake O is getting HOT if your interested in getting out check us out... www.wepoundemfishing.com  tightlines  Ryan Hare  Al with his first of the year   Deanna with her first of the year   Dan with a nice brown   Me with my first of the year off the 10 colour.. sore arms!!   our box for the tourney
