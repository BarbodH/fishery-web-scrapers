337441,frozen-fire,2009-05-03 01:25:00,542,"WOW there were a lot of people out there today chucking lures... from both shore and boat. Picked this one up 15 minutes into the day. Very clean pike! Ended up being 31"" and is my personal best so far. Nothing amazing. My girlfriend still has me beat as hers is 33"" from last year Was the only fish we managed to see aside from one caught from a boat. No follows at all... which is weird for me.     Admiring a beautiful predator.   Back where it belongs.    "

337472,SBCregal,2009-05-03 02:41:00,688,"nice fish i wasnt lucky enough to get into any at all today.  tried bayfront park in hamilton and the bridge down by valley in road in hamilton/burlington.  the wind was killer and the water was all muddy.  gonna try and get out tomorrow too for a bit, hopefully its a little more comfortable out.  ryan"

337740,CLofchik,2009-05-03 23:52:00,854," Did the same and a few other spots around Hamilton.  Complete blank, no follows.......not even a sheepie.  Water was alot murkier at Bayfront than it usually is, but temp was good.  Even Hot Steel drew a blank in Steeltown.    Remember to operate a boat in TO you need a Harbour License. http://www.torontoport.com/PortAuthority/p...rmits_intro.asp"
