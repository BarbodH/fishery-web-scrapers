337993,putzer,2009-05-04 14:47:00,1,just fishing for some info. I live in Calgary and I am planning a trip to Ontario and need a little help. I plan to fish for some pike on Lake Couchiching for the long weekend and I am going with a friend who does not know the lake very well. so........what lures to buy and where to fish on this Lake for spring pike. any help would be greatly appreciated.  seeing as I don't have a boat I shore fish for trout out here. Fished the bow river yesterday and caught one rainbow which was about 17-18 inches and then a beautiful brown trout which was around 21-22 inches. wish i had a pic to show you guys. will bring the camera next time.
