337660,Dutch,2009-05-03 20:40:00,831,"Is this a fair price:  2004 18.5 foot LUND   04 Lund Adventure Series,  05 115 Merc 4 Stroke, live wells front and back, 4 pedestal seats, 2 jump seats, bimmini top along with mooring covers, motor under warranty until 2011, boat and motor have 38 hours on them. Minkota 65lb removable trolling motor, hummingbird fish finder. Shorelander trailer included.   $15, 0000"
337661,danbouck,2009-05-03 20:42:00,4380,Sounds like a good deal to me
337663,irishfield,2009-05-03 20:45:00,26272,Have you seen the warrantee card?? 6 year on a Merc isn't out of line.. just isn't normal. They had the offer to do so in the USA.. but not Canada when I bought mine in 2007.  I've never priced that series.. so can't offer much.. but do know that for $15k I'd suspect that if it was brand new that barely covers the motor and the trailer.. nothing else.
337666,express168,2009-05-03 20:50:00,327,"I never owned a Lund but that sounds like a good price to me, the motor alone is worth a good chunk of change as Irishfield said."
337670,Terry,2009-05-03 20:58:00,14456,I would buy it for that
337672,mikeh,2009-05-03 21:03:00,824,sounds like a good deal and a nice boat
337677,BillM,2009-05-03 21:39:00,17367,Sounds like a US boat.

337693,rob v,2009-05-03 22:26:00,535,Sounds like a pretty good deal to me.  http://www.boattest.ca/boatsandplaces/test...p;engineType=OB
337708,Dutch,2009-05-03 22:58:00,831,"Thanks for the comments guys, unfortunately boat sold to a Sudbury resident, dealer of all people, according to the seller.  Apparently I was third in line and #2 took it.  Really kicking myself now as it was a fantastic boat at a very, very competitve price.  Just goes to show you have to act fast.  Well, there may be another one out there someday....."
337713,Greencoachdog,2009-05-03 23:10:00,8163,If you should happen to buy a Lund some day... don't forget to ask for your hat!!!  
337718,irishfield,2009-05-03 23:21:00,26272,I'm gonna start charging  you royalties on that pic Dawg... lol
337721,Dara,2009-05-03 23:23:00,3052," Not on your life!!!    Look around at the price of new stuff that you want. keep an eye on what used stuff is worth. When the deal shows up, jump on it. You gotta do your homework first. Looking at new prices helps to educate you a lot"
