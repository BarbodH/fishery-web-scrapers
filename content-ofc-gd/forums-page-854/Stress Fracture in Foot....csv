337467,pigeonfisher,2009-05-03 02:34:00,696,"DANG...  I have had crushing pain in the outside of my right foot since a raquetball game a couple of weeks ago.  I played again on Friday for about 1 1/2 hours and it didn't hurt while I played; however, since playing it is all I can do to walk on it without the aid of ibuprofen or alcohol.  I did change shoes for Friday as my previous shoe was fine for treadmilling and elipticalling etc. but failed miserably in holding my foot for the raquetball game.  Could a shoe change cause this mess?  Anyone dealt with this?  I guess I see the good doc sometime this week and try to get a diagnosis or a referral to the pediatrist.  DANG"
337471,cram,2009-05-03 02:40:00,1733,"I had a stress fracture in a little bone in my foot (outside'ish).  Went to a sports doctor and he told me its.... - common - something he can't really do anything for...just rest  No way of knowing if its the same bone, but shoes could make a difference.  And if it is the same, only thing that you can do is rest it.  Heals relatively fast."
337475,pigeonfisher,2009-05-03 02:43:00,696,"Cram,  Thanks.  Rest meaning don't kill it or stop walking?"
337476,tinbanger,2009-05-03 02:44:00,1028,Sorry to hear that . Can't offer much help I'm afraid  best of luck tb
337479,cram,2009-05-03 02:47:00,1733," Stopped sports for awhile.  The bone was outside-front'ish.....basically the outside of my front ""pad""...if that makes sense.  It did hurt to walk on for a bit, but went away relatively quickly.  Also, the bone in question was relatively tiny."
337484,pigeonfisher,2009-05-03 02:53:00,696,"Mine is on the outside middle of the foot.  If you could imagine a pressure point of your foot moving in a lose shoe as you reach for a ball and then pivot back in the other direction.  I was hoping it was bruised but it seems to be lasting.  Well, we will see.  I have a game scheduled for Monday and then the rest of the week I will stick to the pool.  See if it gets better."
337486,SoDa,2009-05-03 03:01:00,3,"Three stress fractures in ankle and foot and it was the most intense pain I ever felt, that same accident also got part of my achilles. I guess you got to follow doctors orders."
337495,Joey,2009-05-03 03:27:00,9122,"I had that once Steve.  I jumped up to catch a baseball and when I landed, my foot was sideways, so I landed on the side of my foot.  It hurt like you are saying and I had xrays and there was a hairline fracture.  Had to walk with crutches for a week or so.  Hurt like the dickens.  Healed on its own.  Sorry for you pain buddy, I feel it.  Joey"
337498,DRIFTER_016,2009-05-03 03:41:00,10439,"Did the same bone last September jumping down from a river bank. I took 6 or 8 weeks to fully heal. No cast, crutches just limp along for a while."
337501,bigfish1965,2009-05-03 04:28:00,3382,Perhaps you exceeded the recommended load maximum.  Sorry your foot hurts bud. Thankfully fishing requires little foot strength.
