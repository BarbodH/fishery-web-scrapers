337827,johnnyb,2009-05-04 01:52:00,3413,"Hey Spinnerdoc...the lures look good...X-raps and similar jerkbaits are also a popular choice.  If you do a forum search for ""toronto islands"" or ""toronto pike"" you should find all the info you desire.  Also hit up facebook for the toronto fishing fanatics group.  Good luck!"
