336127,bigugli,2009-04-28 23:50:00,6138," In the mid 1980's we had the big swine flu scare in Toronto, Emergency and contigency protocols were established. Immunization was strongly urged, but not ordered mandatory, for health care workers. We had the big media blitz on radio, television and print. The end result, more health care workers were incapacitated by the vacinne than the virus. Truth is that in this crowded world, disease travels faster than any policy or program. Governments don't have the oomph to lay down quarantines like they once did. Any body remember the red  cards that were posted to your door if you had mumps or measles. Immigrants used to be quarantined on arrival. Closing the border to specific nationals. These are measures which are designed to slow the spread of an outbreak until suitable countermeasures can be put in place."
336128,bigfish1965,2009-04-28 23:58:00,3382,Well it looks like it doesn't matter now. CNN just did a story and one of the interviewees was the head of Ontario's Health Dep't says this has probably been going on for two or more months and we are just now getting confirmation as all the pieces came together. Containment is no longer possible but it appears the cases in Ontatio and the rest of Canada have all been mild. Thinking back to a few weeks ago when I was sick..I am left to wonder. Many of my friends have been to Mexico over the last 2 months.

Toronto - Ontario's chief medical officer of health said Tuesday four people in Ontario have mild cases of swine flu, the first cases for the province.  The province's Medical Officer of Health Dr. David Williams said three patients in Durham Region and one in York Region are suffering from the virus.  Williams said all four cases in Ontario are considered mild and the individuals are recovering at their homes.  He added that testing confirmed that the virus is the same as the one in Mexico and the United States.  The Ontario cases, which all involve people who travelled to Mexico, put the nationwide total at 13.  There have been two cases of the swine flu in Alberta and four in Nova Scotia, all of them mild cases that didn't require hospitalization, and British Columbia has three cases.  Earlier in the day, Toronto city officials said there were no confirmed cases of swine flu in Toronto, but that they had a plan in place for any outbreak.  Toronto's Medical Officer of Health Dr. David McKeon said hospitals, doctor's offices and EMS staff were watching closely for any cases of respiratory disease that could be Toronto's first cases.  ""This type of surveillance and reporting of influenza-like illness and cases with a travel history has been in place in Toronto since the 2003 SARS outbreak. So, these procedures are not new to us, and they're not new to our hospital and healthcare provider partners,"" McKeon said.  The city confirmed it has an ample stockpile of antiviral drugs, which would be reserved to treat anyone who becomes ill and the frontline medical staff who have to treat them, because they are the highest risk of contracting the disease.  There have been 152 deaths in Mexico, with most of them suspected cases of swine flu.  Source - 680 news"

There is a big crackdown on the drug cartel especially in northern Mexico which has reeked havoc in the country. The Canadian Government (like the U.S.) is typically powerless to assist so you're on your own. I believe the major airlines are offering a change of destination without penalty while this swine flu is around. There are many alternatives in the Caribbean as well so it may be wise to avoid a hotspot until things cool down. Most sun destinations have an unwritten rule where tourists are somewhat protected, Cuba being a good example. Mexico would be the opposite in my opinion (for all it's worth).  Best of luck!  Peter"
