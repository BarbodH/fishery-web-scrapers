Well, all I can say for my first night fishing experience was it was awesome ! We were fishing in roughly 20' FOW about 90-100 yards from shore. We were using a new technique to me... Chugging... We have a three was swivel... 18"" down was a 3oz pencil weight.... then off the back we had a 6' line to a pencil plug, off the back of the pencil plug another 6' of line tied to a rapala husky jerk. It was an interesting way to do things hahah a lot of line to get tangle, but if your careful, with the 2 of us on board. it went very smoothly.  I'm curious.... for the guys that fish with this technique.... Where can you buy chugging rods ??? I don't see them anywhere... I have the BPS catalog and Ive looked and found nothing.  As far as action goes.... Stover landed 1 good size walleye and had a few bites.... I on the other hand came up short ahah Oh well, it was more for the learning experience last night than anything... Now I know what to expect next time !  I didn't get any pics really.... nothing to be to excited about..... Well... The Lake freighters going by a few hundred yards away it pretty sweet... I must say !   Well... Time to go work on the boat ! Have a good day folks !  Tyler"

Never used them myself but I'm told once you get the hang of it it can be very productive.  Hand lining is said to work well also.
337619,Lunker777,2009-05-03 17:50:00,866, Yea Stover was telling me about a time he went out himself and caught 8 fish in about 30 minutes... I think its still early in the season... and the water was pretty muddy if that makes a difference !  I'll have to get to the Gander mountain then... his rod and reel combo was about $100.
