337667,evster,2009-05-03 20:53:00,367,"I have a small little boat trailer which carries a barebones 14 foot aluminum boat and a 9.9 motor.  So not much weight.  The tires on the thing right now are 5.20 - 10.  I want to replace them both, one is completely flat and the other one should probably be replaced as well.  I'd also like to replace the rims.  Problem is, I have checked both princess auto, canadian tire and another trailer part shop and none of them carry 10 inch rims and tires.  Its either 8 or 12.  First off, does anyone know of a place that might carry 10 inch 4 bolt rims and tires?  Second, should I be able to get away with an 8 inch rim?  The tire is only about an inch and a half from the fender so I don't think the 12 inch will be an option.  Any input is much appreciated."

337815,evster,2009-05-04 01:36:00,367,Thanks guys!  I will try checking out those places and call around to some trailer shops in the area.
337853,irishfield,2009-05-04 02:19:00,26272,Walk into any good tire shop. They can order and have the next day.. rims included.
337908,Woodsman,2009-05-04 11:10:00,1286,"I had the same problem a few years back. My tires were quite old & a size not common any more. Rim size does not always correspond to tire height. My old tires were: 6.90/6.00 X 9 and were 20"" high. Replaced with: 5.30 X 12 that are 20"" high. To order the older tires it was going to be over $100 each. New tires & rims IIRC was $70 each. It was far cheaper get new tires & rims. Go with the largest tire height you can, it will decrease tire & bearing wear. Also ensure the weight ratings on your tires is suitable.  Rick"
