From what I've read and heard from many of you in the past few months (thanks a bunch) is pretty much this.  Have approximately 2 ft of leader and add spaced out split shots so that the bobber floats totally vertical and travels at the speed of the current.  Of course I've heard of many other varients but for the most part these are the basics.  Now for the scenerio.  Lets's say the rig is working fine for the pools but I notice a large eddy created by a hard rock.  Unfortunately, this eddy is in a run or riffle and the depth is no more than let's say 2 1/2  feet.  What must I do to the rig to float it by the eddy and still keep a realistic presentation of the bait?  Finally, one last question.  If you can't achieve a perfectly vertical bobber is it better to have the tip of the bobber pointing upstream (leader not having enough weight) or the tip pointing downstream (leader having too much weight)?   Thanks again."

You want to trot your float (Holding it back a bit with the reel) so that the presentation stays downstream of the float and not directly under it or upstream of it.  There are also different shot patterns for different river conditions..  If you are fishing fast water you'll want to be bulk shoting right underneath your float to c.o.c.k it correctly and also right above your leader in order to get the bait down quickly.  If you find a nice eddy out in the middle of a fast run I'd bulk shot like crazy, cast out beyond the rock and pull the presentation in quickly behind it.  I'm sure a few other guys will chime in and offer their help."
