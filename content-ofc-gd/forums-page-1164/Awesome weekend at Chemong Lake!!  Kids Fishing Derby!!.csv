103165,ccmtcanada,2007-08-13 00:28:00,7971,"A good friend of mine invited us up to his trailer up on Chemong Lake in the Kawarthas for the weekend.  This was our frist time up there and we had a BLAST!  His two daughters were there and my little one had LOTS of fun swimming, playing, watching movies, and of course fishing!  Perfect weather on Friday and Saturday...and it started to rain as we were packing up to head back home on Sunday.  On Saturday, there was a fishing derby.  Over 70 kids had registered and it was a ton of fun.  The trailer park organized this FREE event.  Each kid got a hat and a bag full of candies and toys for participating.  The kids were divided up in to two groups....ages 3 to 6 and then 7 to 12.  My little one competed in the first group...she's 5.  Here's a group shot just before the lines hit the water.   She did fantastic!  The little kids only had 30 minutes to fish and she ended up with 11 fish in that little time!  The winning kid had 15, but that placed her in Second Place...a great accomplishment for her first time in a derby.  We were very proud of her!!  Here's a few shots of the action...the first...and her secret was that she hand picked all her bait.  The second pic shows her intently waiting for her float to go down....     Bly and I went out in my buddy's boat a few times while we were there, and while no BIG fish were caught, we did manage to waste away a bunch of hours relaxing and chatting out on the water.  Here's a few shots of our catches...  My buddy with a largie...   The first time ever for me...I caught a crappie!! LOL.   Our order of Jumla's came in just in time for this trip, and while I didn't have much luck with them, bly was trying to see just how many species she could catch with them.  Here's a short summary....  Largemouth Bass....   Crappie....   Walleye.....   She also caught Bluegill, Sunfish and Perch...all with those Jumlas!!!  My buddy then took us all out on a great little boat tour.  My little one laughed and screamed the whole time.  She wants to know when we can get a big and fast boat...LOL.    Anyhow, my little begged us to head back to the docks to go fishing before we had to leave on Sunday, so after a morning swim and lunch, we headed back down there to see what was hanging around.  She caught about 25 fish in about an hour, and not just little baby panfish like the day before.  Here was a few of her larger ones....she was very cute.... ""DADDEEEEE come here and take this picture...he's HUGE""....LOL.  A few of them almost yanked the rod out of her little hands, but she fought them...bringing them back out from under the docks...she was a little pro out there.        So, as usual when I fish with the family, I caught the fewest and smalled fish....LOL.  I believe the Jumla count was 26 fish....5 species, although Bly may correct me.  We all had a GREAT time up there this weekend.  The smiles on the kids' faces were all the reward I needed.  Now it's back to the reality of the office....UGH!"
103167,Blake,2007-08-13 00:31:00,418,Glad to see you had a great weekend and also the kids getting into fishing
103169,bigfish1965,2007-08-13 00:35:00,3382,"Ahh yes...Heinreich Jumla would be proud. I'm not just saying that cause I am the VP of the company! Jumlas are only available through Avery's Tackle in Sturgeon Falls. There have been some cheap knock offs, but there is only one Jumla."
103178,canadianguy33,2007-08-13 00:54:00,121,"Sounds like a great weekend.  Looking at that 7th picture (the one titled ""Crappie"" with the two islands in the background on the right) I'm 95% sure I know where that is (the cameraman is facing the Causeway right?).  Anyways, if you're up on Chemong again, try fishing on the north side of the big island in the picture.   I've caught all kinds of 2-4lbs LM bass there just swimming around in the thin weed bed.  I don't fish Chemong much, but that's the spot my brother and I take my nieces for a quick fish.  Another tip, grab some Berkley Power Baits.  The kids will be pulling all of sorts of stuff in faster than you can take them off the hook."
103184,mattyk,2007-08-13 01:05:00,2110,"great pictures, thanks for sharing looks like a great time!"
103228,Bly,2007-08-13 02:15:00,1556,"  Close, the cameraman has his back to the causeway in that picture but I think I saw the island that you are referring to....thanks for the tip! If we are able to get back up there will have to try it out...oh and thanks for the tip on the Berkley bait!!!"
103233,tbayboy,2007-08-13 03:07:00,1497,Great stuff.  Your daughter continues to be the most adorable fisherman(person?) out there and I can just imagine how proud you were of her second place.  5 years old and she outfishes dad - I love it
103245,fatherof3,2007-08-13 04:07:00,1769,"great report, good to see you and your family having a blast fishing"
103246,dustink,2007-08-13 04:09:00,526,"some great pics, Cliff!  Looks like you guys had a great time!  dk"
103252,canadianguy33,2007-08-13 04:45:00,121,"  lol okay so I was wrong about the spot.  Anyways, not that it's important, but the spot I was referring to is north of the Causeway. If you start your boat at the Causeway you'll pass the two islands in the photo.  Keep going until the second set of islands and fish on the north side of the big island.  I like that spot for the simple reason that it's close to the Causeway where I usually park (I'm sure you know how quickly kids can tire of fishing lol)."
103262,Tarzan's Jane,2007-08-13 07:10:00,1183,"How cute is that.  Cliff when you write about your daughter, there is so much love and pride - thank you for sharing your weekend with her with us.  Bet ya Daddy is going to try to get that faster boat for his little princess   lol"
103297,motv8tr,2007-08-13 11:35:00,2587,Sure looks and sounds like a great weekend!  Your little one sure got herself some nice fish!  Maureen
103345,MJL,2007-08-13 13:51:00,2427,Great pics Cliff...Congrats on the little one getting second place...You've got a match fisher-person in the making.
103366,wolfville,2007-08-13 15:29:00,396,"In my opinion, eveyone took part in the event won the first place. Great report and thanks for sharing."
103386,wuchikubo,2007-08-13 16:50:00,1114,"Hey Cliff,  I know that exact spot, my brother is up there as well. According to my mom, who just visited him yesterday, one of my brother's sons (he has 3) won his division (Age 7, maybe 8) with 40 sunfish and the largest fish (bass) to give him the double crown! PM me the name of your friend and I'll pass the name to my brother (who's up there every weekend) to see if they'd like to hook up some time.  Glad to see your daughter had fun!  Stan"
103408,ccmtcanada,2007-08-13 18:07:00,7971," Hey Stan,  I remember that kid!  He was a machine....LOL.  The younger kids fished for 30 minutes, while the older ones had a full hour.  He did a great job out there.  The trailer we were at was actually my friend's parents...my friend isn't up there all the time. Nice hearing from you again Stan,  Cliff"
103445,Joey,2007-08-13 19:43:00,9122,"Wow, that looked like a great time and awesome weekend.  The weather was sure on your side.  Good job on the Crappie.  I've yet to catch one of those little........  Love the pictures.  Joey"
