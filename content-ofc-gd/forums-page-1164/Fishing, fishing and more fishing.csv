First up is the most successful of the 3, the always productive Lake St. Clair. Got out for a couple hours on both Friday and Saturday and was rewarded with some nice smallies, a couple of hard fighting sheephead and even a silver bass thrown into the mix. You never really know what you're going to have bite the end of your line when you're out on LSC. Following are some of the highlights...  A beautiful Friday morning, no other place i'd rather be than on the water             Last weekend I took the family for some camping at Elora Gorge, some frinds and my little brother joined us. We were mostly there for the camping but wouldn't have been disappointed if the fish were biting too. Got out for an hour or two a couple of the days we were there. Nothing spectatular.  Quite a few this size.   My first brown trout, first fish from the salmon family actually!!   The largest bass caught, a solo pic thus half a fish.   Beautiful scenery nonetheless, and awesome weather.       And a great first camping trip for Addison.     Yesterday we decided to try out the Niagara River. About 5 hours of fishing and nothing to show for it except a decent tan, burned calories and some nice pics of the scenery.  We started out above the falls.   And ended at the whirlpool.     The walk out would have been a lot more enjoyable had we memories of fish, but still a good day outdoors.   Until next time.  d"

103162,canadianguy33,2007-08-13 00:14:00,121,Great pics!  I love the one with the big rock face.  I notice that the vertical striping on your bass seems really faint.  I've often caught smallies with either dark or very light striping and I've always wondered why they're different.  Does anyone have any insight?
