I tried searching, but the latest mention was the pike derby at the end of May.  Feel free to PM me if you want to keep things private. I am wondering whether I should put the cartopper in by the dam and fish the south end or put it in at the north end and fish up there...?  Any hot baits for the lake?  Any help is appreciated."

It was my first time on the lake, so I am by no means the master of Belwood, but I kbow how to catch a Bass, and we asked some regulars who said that they had not marked a single fish on thier electronics.  The only action seemed to be at the bottom of the dam where it was shoulder to shoulder. Apparently there are Walleye at Belwwod now, so I assume everyone was going for them.  I am going on another local fishing day next weekend, and from what I have heard, Guelph lake is a better bet.  TIFWIW"
