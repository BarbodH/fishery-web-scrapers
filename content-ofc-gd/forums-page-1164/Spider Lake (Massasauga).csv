I spend most of my work day reading post and looking at pictures from other members.  The board has been a great help thus far.  Spider Lake (Massasauga) is the reason for my first post.  Can anyone give me some info on this Lake (fish type, lures, or just an overall comment on the lake and campsites)  Thanks for your help."
