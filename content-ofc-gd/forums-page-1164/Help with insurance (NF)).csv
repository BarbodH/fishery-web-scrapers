I'm looking into a couple of options, one getting a new car to replace the one I have and two, looking at using a new car as a back-up non-commuting car.  the company I'm with now says to add a second vehicle, it will cost pretty much the same as I'm paying for the beater I currently have....I am the only driver here.  Also looking into Life insurance as opposed to Mortgage Insurance.  If you can help...please PM me  Thanks  Maureen"
