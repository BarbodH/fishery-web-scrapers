The fishing was about the same, as it warmed up the fish were biting. My son showed me up by out numbering me and pulled out the two biggest fish of the day (large mouth and samllie). Sparrow continues to be my 12 year old's favorite lake producing his first ever ""big"" fish a few years ago and now his biggest fish a five pounder plus. I'll never forget when he caught his first bass as he kept yelling, ""it's a bass, it's a bass"". Memmories for sure!!  "
103106,Carp,2007-08-12 17:41:00,1488,Always great to get the kids out there fishing. Looks like he had a blast. Thanks for the report and pics.

103120,motion,2007-08-12 18:34:00,403,"Thanks guys he sure had a blast. Funny, he knows more about fishing now then I did at twice his age! At the very least I know he is not out somewhere looking for ways to get into trouble."
103190,bucketmouthjohnny,2007-08-13 01:14:00,115,"OMG, he looks like a miniature Dave Mercer with that shirt !!!!  Nice Fish!!! Keep pounding!!  John"
103209,motion,2007-08-13 01:46:00,403,"You've got that right, Dave is his hero. Mercer is great with the kids. He sent my boy that shirt last year and he wears it everytime we go fishing."
103240,fatherof3,2007-08-13 03:59:00,1769,nice job and report

103293,motv8tr,2007-08-13 11:25:00,2587,Nice fish!!!  Maureen
103295,ccmtcanada,2007-08-13 11:33:00,7971,He sure looks like a pro out there!  You never forget the excited voice of a kid who has caught their first or biggest fish.  Great report and pics...thanks for sharing!
103320,motion,2007-08-13 12:29:00,403,"I will never forget it......he won't let me. He keeps reminding me of the day he ""caught one bigger than dad's"" The nice thing about the fish he caught in the pics posted, is that he picked a spot on the lake, picked his bait and nailed them all by himself. Makes me proud to be a dad."
103322,JFR,2007-08-13 12:34:00,498,Nice outing and fish.  Always great when you can take your young ones out for a day of healthy activities.  Enjoy all your time with him.  Thank you for sharing

And if he likes sparrow lake, you should take him to other lakes like six mile lake. Sparrow is the only lake I have ever been skunked and not once but TWICE!!  Looks like he is a better fisherman than me, and has good fisherman instinct."
