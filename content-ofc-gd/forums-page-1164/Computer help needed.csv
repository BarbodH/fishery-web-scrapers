103527,Kawartha Kev,2007-08-13 23:49:00,281,Sorry to post this here but I posted it also in the help forum but don't seem to be getting any responses thanks if you can help me out.  I recently upgraded my antivirus from MCaffee to the Rogers Yahoo online protection with Norton Antivirus and firewall and now I have major problems viewing the forums in the Hi fi version. The only way I could do it was to disable the anti virus and firewall completely and it is dead slow compared to when I was running Mcafee. I seem to remember other people having similar problems can anyone help me out. All ican get to on the hi fi version is the main forum listing and then when I try to go into the general discussion forum or help forum all I get is a blank page  Thanks Kawartha Kev
103530,Gerritt,2007-08-14 00:00:00,6129,Sounds like yu might be experiencing a Java issue... Norton is a PIA always has been... it could also be because of the ads... I would suggest you look at your Norton Settings and look for mention of Javascript and Adblocking.  Sorry I did not see your post in the help forum..  Post your results.. and lets try to narrow this sucker down.  Gerritt.  PS.... I hate NORTON!!!!!!
103532,Kawartha Kev,2007-08-14 00:06:00,281,I updated Java and will have a look around in Norton to see what I can find. It seems to work if I disable the fire wall part of Norton so maybe somewhere in there is where the problem could be. Does this sound likely?  Kawartha Kev
103533,Gerritt,2007-08-14 00:08:00,6129,uh huh.....  I have not used Norton product since Utilities ... so I cant comment on direct settings to change however sounds like JavaScipt or adblocking is the most likely culprit.  Gerritt.
103535,Kawartha Kev,2007-08-14 00:12:00,281,Can't seem to find anything about Javascript or adblocking
103537,Corey,2007-08-14 00:17:00,355," You waited less than 30 minutes before deciding to post this in here? I suppose those who know the computer stuff should monitor the Computer Help area each minute for someone to post so that we can immediately help them out?  I would ban you.  oh... and because I feel nice... go into your control panel, add & remove programs, and remove everything that says mcafee, rogers, security, norton, etc. and then just reinstall a single protection suite of your choice. The more the merrier doesn't apply here. You have a whole buch of competing software on your machine and they are fighting eachother screwing everything up."
103539,Kawartha Kev,2007-08-14 00:23:00,281,Sorry to post it so fast in this forum I just though tmore people might see it here and I have been trying to deal with this issue for 3 days and am getting  a little frustrated thanks for the input  Kawartha Kev
