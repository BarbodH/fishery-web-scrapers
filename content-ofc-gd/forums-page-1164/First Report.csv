103460,mgarre01,2007-08-13 20:39:00,6,"This is the first post from me on this forum, the names Garrett. A friend of mine is on here (Abberz), and told me about the site. I got out for a fish yesterday and I decided to make report about the success we were having. We were feeling pretty hung over but managed to get on the water around 3:00 and the smallmouth/largemouth bite was on. Jeff was able to bring this monster in right off the dock while we were still loading the boat.    It took about 15 minutes to land our next fish and shortly after we were interrupted by rain. The rain lasted about 10 minutes and my buddy Dave (LandOLakesLunker) pulled out this porker of a largemouth while flippin’. Weighed in at 4lbs. 11oz.    The action picked up and was very steady throughout the afternoon and into the evening. LandO got this 3lb. LM.    I had started to get pretty frustrated and more determined, so about an hour later and a half a deck of cigarettes, the smallies finally came. LandO and I pulled these bad boys out of a different weed bed in the evening around 7:00 and they put up one heck of a fight. Hauled them into the boat KVD style and carried on.      It ended up being an awesome day out on the water and topped off a great weekend. All fish were released. I’m getting out on the water about 3 times a week these days so I hope to have more reports in the near future."
