I headed out at about 5 or so and fished untill 8 and since I didn't have the keys to the boat lock I just fished from shore. In the couple of hours out there I had many strikes and pulled in 3 or 4 decent bass maybe a couple pounds and a bunch of one lbers these were all on pink Senko's or fin-s shads I also grabbed a couple on some spinnerbaits and even pulled out a couple pike on the spinnerbait too... I hope to go out a couple more times this week as I need to do some fishing to catch up so expect some picture packed reports of bass, Pike and possibly walleye and also some trout reports if the rivers decide to cooperate... Have a great summer all and good fishing.  Bill"
