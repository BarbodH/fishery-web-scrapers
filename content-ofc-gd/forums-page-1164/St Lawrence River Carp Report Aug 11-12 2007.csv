103735,Roy,2007-08-14 17:32:00,13728,A great report Tony. Yes Long Sault is  certainly one of the carp hot spots. I camped there a couple of times last summer. Fairly clean water too. From our campsite we could sometimes see a US patrol boat with a gun mounted on the front. :-) I think it's probably illegal to fish that way though.
