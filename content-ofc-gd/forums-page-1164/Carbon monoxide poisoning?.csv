The boater gets confused and ends up over the side. There have been warnings from boating publications and trans ca. about this in the last year or 2..  I know a couple that were slowly cruising BOQ. heading with the wind and they both passed out.  So be aware of the possibility when your out there."

I could see noxious gases ""knocking"" someone out... in a closed environment .... but even if the wind was dead calm or at their back... I would say this is an old wives tale... as it would only take a mild wind to air out an open boat... unless I was sleeping on the floor due to the Ol' Millwackie!   Gerritt."
