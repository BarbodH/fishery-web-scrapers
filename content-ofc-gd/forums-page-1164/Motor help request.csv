The motor is an old Evinrude 15hp.  The pull cord won't recoil so I have to pop the lid and recoil it by hand to pull the cord each time. The engine starts fine and runs well. The cord connects to a small disc with gears that raises and engages the flywheel.  Is it easy to replace the spring to recoil the cord or can it be a bit of a pain reassembly everything afterwards? Also, are there any tips or tricks or pitfalls to be wary of.  Thanks"
103704,Gerritt,2007-08-14 16:11:00,6129,I replaced my recoil spring on my 25hp Johnson last year when it snapped while on vacation.. I did it on a picnic table and it took about 45 minutes.. Get an extra pair of hands to help you once you put the recoil spring under tension. It is a simple fix and  can be completed with an average set of tools (decent socket set) this is certainly a repair a novice can tackle.  Good Luck!  Gerritt.  Ps. while you have it apart it would be a good idea to replace the pull cord at the same time.
103718,bowshep,2007-08-14 16:38:00,378,What Gerritt said. Out of all the Jobs on a motor its one step up from an oil change. Note do not get the cord covered in dirt it will reduce the life of the cord. Peace Ken
103741,jughead,2007-08-14 17:37:00,92,Thanks guys. I think I will give it as shot myself. Also a good suggestion about replacing the cord while I/m in there. That is very logical and makes good sense which is why it would not have occurred to me.
