I have a new prop I am going to be trying out and I figure heck I might as well give some skies a whirl for an hour or two. Anyone hit any skies lately on scugog and able/willing to offer some insight.. colors, depths, location etc....?"
103443,Fishnfiend,2007-08-13 19:41:00,357,Good luck to ya!  I can't offer any advice as I haven't been on the bog since hardwater season.
103444,BFSC Kevin,2007-08-13 19:42:00,1351,"i couldn't make it out this past weekend, but i'll be sure out in 10 days! for the first time on scugog for some skis too. good luck!"
103447,jedimaster,2007-08-13 19:53:00,3472,Like I said mostly out to test a new Prop on the boat but you can't very well go out in a boat on the water without getting a line wet. Hopping to get in an hour or two. Doubt I'll hook anything but I'll try to have a picture or two.

103463,mcallister.grant,2007-08-13 20:44:00,327,I never fished the bog myself; but good luck to ya!
103556,jedimaster,2007-08-14 01:07:00,3472,"got home late from work only had time to run some seafoam through the carb and and try out the new prop, works good. Man those weeds are thick on the north end, I didn't think I was gonna make it through them.  Saw a couple big cruisers having hard times as well. Only got a few casts in, so didn' really fish."
