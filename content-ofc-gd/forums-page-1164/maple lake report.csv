103004,Matt15,2007-08-12 02:11:00,107,"Went fishing today on maple lake in the haliburton area. We were mainly fishing for musky.  At around ten o'clock I had a fish on, right away I thought it was a musky since we were told there were no pike in this  lake.  When the fish finally revealed itself I couldn't believe that it was a northern.  It wasn't what I was targetting but it is a personal best for me so i was happy. In the picture my dad is holding the fish.  I regret not taking a picture with it but I wanted to get it in the back in the water.  I forgot to measure it but i think its a respectable northern.   matthew"

103137,Lostchild,2007-08-12 21:29:00,153,"Interesting...is this the Maple Lake connected to Beech and Green Lake? None of the 6 or more lakes in that chain list having pike in them, in fact nowhere around Haliburton has any lakes with pike in them. (i know elephant and bastiste do, closer to bancroft)  Anyhow, it is a very nice pike you caught there!  "
103173,Matt15,2007-08-13 00:43:00,107,thanks banger and thanks lostchild for enlarging the picture. When we showed some of the locals the pics they couldn't beleve that it was from maple lake. It is the lake connected to beech and green.

103574,tbayboy,2007-08-14 01:49:00,1497,Nice pike - I'll take a surprise fish like that anytime.
103926,Matt15,2007-08-15 03:00:00,107,"Thanks everyone, Tbayboy I thought the same. A surprise fish like that is better then catching nothing so it put me in a good mood even though I didnt catch a musky."
