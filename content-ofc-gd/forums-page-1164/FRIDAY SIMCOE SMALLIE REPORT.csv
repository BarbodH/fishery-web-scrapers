Mark"

I have been out to Simcoe a couple of times this year fummbling my way a round but I am slowly starting to get the idea. I figure in a few more years I may have some decent knowledge of the Simcoe smallie.LOL  I was out with my son last week for a few hours and we caught 8 smaliies,I was up on him 6-0 at one point and he was getting frustrated until he finally had a pick up when everything was said and done he boated a nice smallie that was pushing 6 pounds maybe more didn`t get a weight on it ironically it was his first trip to Simcoe and his first ever smallmouth the smile on his face was priceless."
