103052,ORSON,2007-08-12 11:51:00,2,I am heading up to the west arm the last week of August and was wondering what I can expect for fishing conditions. How is the water level? Typically which species would be most catchable? Any advise would be greatly appreciated.

This trip I will mainly fish for walleye, pike, small mouth bass and if we are lucky a musky.  I've fished the West Arm a few times in the past, just really concerned with the low water levels and dry warm weather we've had this year.  Again any info would be helpful.  Thanks again."
