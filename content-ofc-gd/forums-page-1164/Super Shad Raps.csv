103358,Weeds,2007-08-13 14:48:00,782,"Hi. Maybe kind of a stupid question but I can only afford one so I'd like to choose wisely first time around. I'll be targetting musky with it in the Kawarthas, casting rather than trolling and generally shore fishing. I realize there may be other/better choices but I'm committed to the purchase as I hear they are pretty decent lures. So anyways, are any colour  choices better than others? I'm leaning towards more of a natural type of pattern as I already own a few gaudy lures (firetiger, orange and black, fire perch, etc, etc.) Thanks for any advice you might care to share. Rossco"
103360,BITEME,2007-08-13 14:54:00,1969,The pearl white
103363,Headhunter,2007-08-13 15:01:00,5703,As Biteme says... Pearl White or Fire Tiger! HH
103364,Roy,2007-08-13 15:04:00,13728,"As Biteme and HH have said...pearl white, firetiger or perch."
103365,Squid,2007-08-13 15:04:00,1656,"Pearch pattern hands down. Catches muskies, bass, walleye and big ones too."
103369,mattyk,2007-08-13 15:46:00,2110,Here is one that i caught on a Perch Super Shad Rap.  
103374,jediangler,2007-08-13 16:22:00,1923,"I'v caught muskies in Pigeon on both the chrome and gold chrome Super Shad Raps. And if you want to catch a cancer musky, this one was caught on a bluegill Super Shad Rap. "
103376,mattyk,2007-08-13 16:24:00,2110,thats a nasty looking sore on the fish.
103395,ehg,2007-08-13 17:40:00,2666,"I swear by the Perch Super Shad Rap for the smaller Kawartha muskies! Sometimes i should try other things but...  Took this picture maybe two years ago of a perch SSR chunked by muskies, with a rapala DDHJ-12 chewed by Toronto pike.   ehg"
103467,Pigeontroller,2007-08-13 20:49:00,2793,  Its called Lymphosarcoma. I think I have the spelling correct.
103470,canadianguy33,2007-08-13 21:06:00,121,I'll swear by the perch as well.
103557,Weeds,2007-08-14 01:10:00,782,"OK, thanks for all the advice; I went with the perch.  Seemed to be the most popular choice and at Canadian Tire it was either that or Bluegill. If I like it maybe down the road I'll pick up a Pearl white one."
