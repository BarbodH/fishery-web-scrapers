The fishing was kind of an afterthought as it was just nice to get out on the river by myself for some peace and quiet. When I got back my youngest was mad until I said we could go out after supper. We had a couple of hits each but nothing caught.He was all happy though as he found a green mepps spinner and I said it could be his own lure.Anyways,here are some more pics of fish and scenery.Sorry for the fish pics,was trying to juggle my rod,camera,fish while standing in the river."
