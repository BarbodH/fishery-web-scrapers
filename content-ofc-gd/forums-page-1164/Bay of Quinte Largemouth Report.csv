I fished with him Saturday, but it was a really tough day of fishing, and Barry told me what no angler ever wants to hear ""You should have been here yesterday"". Doh!  We still enjoyed a beautiful day on the water with about 10 largies up to 3lbs on Terminator Pro flipping jigs in black\red and black\blue tipped with black\blue chunk trailers. Barry even got two walleye on flipping jigs! We also got a few hits from gar  We targeted 4' to 9' on the edge of coontail, and also open pockets in shallower sparser coontail.  There was a bad algae bloom in some areas, and dying weeds in a lot of the shoreline.  The fish were located in the healthy weeds.  Only got one pic, but it's on Barry's camera. Will post the pic when I get it from him... if I ever get it  Good fishing!  Aaron"
