102925,joonmoon,2007-08-11 17:57:00,528,My buddy Inspector Gadget and I decided we needed to get his nefews out for a morning of panfishin.    Zach caught the first fish with his new rod and reel he got for his B-day.   His younger bro Conner was not to be outdone and landed this beauty Sunny.   We had a blast fishing some local ponds and plan to do it again soon. The kids really enjoy fishing and don't get a chance to go very often so we'll get em out for some action again real soon. If all else fails with the fish at least there's plenty of nature to explore and frogs to chase.

Did have a largie on the tail of my grub for a few seconds but when I lifted it out of the water it let go, only about 3"" long...lol."
