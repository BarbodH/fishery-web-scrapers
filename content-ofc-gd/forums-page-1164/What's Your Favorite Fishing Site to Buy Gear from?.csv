I've been browsing Ebay today and I'm quite impressed with the prices but the selections and pictures make it kind of a pain in the arse.  I'm wondering what sites you guys use to buy your fishing gear?"
103774,BFSC Kevin,2007-08-14 19:05:00,1351,ebay or instore.. never tried other sites.. or perhaps classifieds like this one on this site!
103775,mattyk,2007-08-14 19:14:00,2110,"i buy almost all my stuff online. My favorite places are ebay, Rollie and Helens Musky Shop and Musky Tales."
103777,rickster,2007-08-14 19:14:00,495,CABELAS  of course I guess I am prejudiced beacause the place I work at is a Cabelas canadian dealer/distributor and I am the lucky guy that takes and places the orders for our customers
103779,tonyb,2007-08-14 19:19:00,1637,"Cabelas all the way, no hidden fees or extra duty charges.  What you see on your online invoice prior to clicking the purchase button is all you pay.  $179.99+ for a reel here vs $109.99 at Cabelas.  What's the U.S. exchange rate? 1% now? the savings are clear.  This applies to all tackle except big bulky items which could cost a lot in shipping.  I got ripped buying a rod pod and carp net here locally, only because of the size of those things it is not appropriate to buy on the Internet.  Tony"
103792,BFSC Kevin,2007-08-14 19:35:00,1351,cabelas eh.. i'll look into that one!
103799,canadianguy33,2007-08-14 19:47:00,121,"Thanks for the help fellas.  I'm really diggin' Cabela's, and Rollie & Helen's Musky Shop, although the really big lures there are about as expensive (maybe even more so) as the local tackle shops up north."
103839,Greencoachdog,2007-08-14 23:12:00,8163,Cabelas.
103844,barracuda,2007-08-14 23:26:00,41,Cabelas S/H is absurd. Tacklewarehouse all the way.
103859,danc,2007-08-15 00:12:00,4677,"Cabelas, since about 1972 or so. Never been disappointed yet."
