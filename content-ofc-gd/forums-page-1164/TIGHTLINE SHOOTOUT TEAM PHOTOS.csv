My hats go off to John, Chris & Vito and all of the volunteers who make this Salmon Tournament the most respected and saught after on the North Shore!  Your tournament committee thought it would be a great idea if we could provide each team with an 8 x 10 photo as a momento of the event.  So as everything else that your tornament committee as for and they recieve.  There are 8 x 10 photos of each and every team that took the time to have there picture taken at the event available for them to pick up at Tightline Fisherman's Warehouse.  Enjoy the images and we look forward to seeing everyone again next year!!!!  Tightlines & Catch The Big ONE!!!  Mitch                                                    "
