Last weekend as a surprise for our wedding anniversary and my birthday, my wife surprised me with a trip to Las Vegas.  We really couldn't afford it but since we've been married this is only the second time we've ever been away alone since the kids have been born. We're not big gamblers so we did a lot of sight seeing and took this one day trip of a lifetime.  We took an ATV ride through the Valley of Fire State Park.  It was a 28 mile track and alot of fun.  For the three days we were there the weather was 108, 104 and 100 degrees respectively.  The thing there is that there is no humidity which is awesome.  It's still plenty warm but without the humidity its alot more bearable.  Anyways here's some pics of the ATV ride of a lifetime...  Getting ready to go..     This is the vehicle we followed which had our lunch and water in it...   The start of some of the awesome scenery...This is where they filmed the desert scenes in the Star Wars trilogy.  We're also near the famous Area 51!!    Our first rest stop.  Tom (the tour guide) showing Sue some of the animals and plants that are in the desert.        I had 5 bottles of water on the trip which lasted 3 1/2 hours, never even had to pee once.   A stop in a valley.....         We stopped for lunch in a nice shaded spot...   While we were having lunch, a pack of desert mountain goats appeared in the mountain ahead of us !!!   A truly awesome day I will remember for the rest of my life.     If you ever head to Vegas, I'd highly recommend trying this.  At a $150, it's a bargain.  Jim"

103232,Deano,2007-08-13 02:37:00,767,Now that gives me a reason to go to vegas. Must of been an awesome ride.
103243,dustink,2007-08-13 04:05:00,526,Looks like a cool trip!!  dk
103247,fatherof3,2007-08-13 04:09:00,1769,"wow,great pics and report. That looks like it would be a blast"
103249,canadianguy33,2007-08-13 04:29:00,121,"Damn, that sure is a lot of ATV's on that truck and that's the baddest looking 'beware of snakes' sign I've ever seen.  That's not a bad deal for $150.  Do you have a link or company name for the ATV guys?  I know my brother is heading down to vegas in the fall and he'd probably jump at the chance to do that kind of thing."
103263,Tarzan's Jane,2007-08-13 07:16:00,1183,"Truly a nice get away.  I too did something similar to that a few years back in Arizona, we rented a jeep and like you had a blast.  Great Birthday/Anniversary Gift.....your wife did real good.  lol"

Hope this help, Mistyjr1"
