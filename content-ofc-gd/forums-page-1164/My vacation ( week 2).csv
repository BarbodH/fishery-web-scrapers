After first week on the shore of Baptiste lake we went home for one day to "" recover"" . Then next day I've hooked up our tent trailer and drive back to the same area ( about 50 km apart ). We've set the camp on the shores of Lake Kamaniskeg. After lazy couple days  in grocery store we've met our old friend. He was at his cottage and invited us to join him. So next day we are on the way. After about 30 km on the back roads (sometimes asfalt, mostly gravel ) we've arrived at the gate. He is waiting for us. From the gate there is another few km through the woods    I've almost hit a tree after seeing this    At the end ( about 30 min drive),we've arrived at what I call Heaven ( no pictures - I will explain leter )  There is beautiful log cottage on the rock, overlooking small private lake    My daughter waiting for the big one    No electricity ( solar panels on the roof), no phone. And this small lake  It was stocked with trout, bass and walleyes. Inside the cottage there are some pictures of some bigger catch (two 35"" rainbows, 30"" walleye, 8 LB 6oz bass,  )  All caught from one of this canoes    The deepest hole is 120', and the ice fishing is unbelivable   . I'm ""Booked"" already   .  We've spend three afternoons/evenings at this place and I'm getting ready for fall and winter trips.  I've lots of pictures of this place, but I've decide not to post them for two reasons:  First of all I do not have permission ( I did not ask ) from the owner, secondly this place was ""raped"" twice in last few years. First poachers with gill nets cleaned this lake of every fish bigger then 12"", then there was a brake in, almost every piece of funiture, glass, all contents were destroyed ( even couple of frying pans were found in the lake). It is sad, because I would like to share with you my experience, but at the same time I do not want to provide any info in regard to the location of this place. Like I've said, for me it is HEAVEN"

103456,mcallister.grant,2007-08-13 20:29:00,327,"I find it amazing how a few idiots can ruin the fun for everyone. Do you know if the gill netters and robbers were apprehended? Thanks for the report, I am sure you had a blast."
103514,Joey,2007-08-13 23:11:00,9122,"Wow, from the pictures you posted it does look like heaven.  Its really too bad about the fish netting and the break in     I don't know what is wrong with people.  Karma will come and get them.  Great report Keram.  Joey"
103517,keram,2007-08-13 23:19:00,585,"about three hrs on the main roads, then I even do not remember   No, they were not  ( it was ""just only fish"" in one case  , and ""you got insurance"" in the other )"
103519,BFSC Kevin,2007-08-13 23:23:00,1351,"so i guess 4 hr drive, wow.. not bad, 4 hour drive to a little piece of heaven!  that's a real shame how people don't respect private property..  kevin"
