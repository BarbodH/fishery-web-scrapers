In the past I have fished some of the other lakes ( Kagawog, Ice, Wolsley etc. ) but never for some reason Manitou.  Since we won't have a lot of time to find spots if anyone can give me some info on better areas to fish for Bass and Laker's it would be appreciated.  Feel free to PM me if you don't want to give your spots or numbers out for all to see. Thanks"
