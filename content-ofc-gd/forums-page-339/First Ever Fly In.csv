757006,hoosier,2013-01-07 00:41:00,29,"Two of the last three years I have taken my sons to drive to lakes. While we had a good time at both locations, I wanted to go to the next level for our 2012 trip. After looking around we decided to do a fly in with Hawk Air. After spending the night in Wawa we arrived extra early at the sea plane base. This was our first fly in so I wasn’t exactly sure what the procedure would be. To my surprise after a quick check in, we were winging away to Lobo Lake an hour ahead of schedule. Once at the cabin we hastily stored our gear and hopped in the boat to get some fishing in before the predicted afternoon storms arrived.  Our first target was pike. We only boated one tiny pike in the first two hours. With the slow fishing we decided to troll back to the cabinet and regroup. Luckily my son caught this guy on the way. It was to be our lunch.   The storms rolled in and kept us off the water for the rest of the day. As we sat around the cabin my mind started to wander. Did we just drive 700 miles and spend a decent amount of money for subpar fishing? I mean aren’t the fish supposed to jump in the boat on a fly in?  The next morning we decided to go after walleye. We did a little drift fishing with jigs and picked up a couple of keepers. Not exactly fast action but at least we were catching a few. A little later in the morning rain once again drove us off the lake. High winds would keep us off the lake until the evening.  That evening things would take a turn for the better and put all my worries to rest. We caught more walleye than we had ever had in any of our past trips including a PB of 24” for my 9 year old. The next day we discovered the world of bottom bouncers and worm harnesses and caught fish consistently the rest of the trip.                           All in all a great trip. Nice clean cabin and the best fishing we have ever had."

757022,kickingfrog,2013-01-07 01:11:00,8333,Great trip! Great memories for sure.
757097,Rod Caster,2013-01-07 10:25:00,5784,"Nice turn of fortunes. I bet you were worried for a couple days there! 24"" is a good PB for a young man!"
757167,Jds63,2013-01-07 15:58:00,1365,Great report ... the smiles on the boys faces says it all !
757635,Whopper,2013-01-08 22:20:00,2174,"Awesome report , I'm sure you and your boys won't forget this trip ever.  I like the display of the wishbone C"
757707,corvette1,2013-01-09 01:35:00,1765,congrats on your first fly-in
757710,solopaddler,2013-01-09 01:47:00,8605,"Great report, thanks for posting! If I'm not mistaken Lobo was originally just a pike lake and Hawk Air stocked it with walleye. It's nice to see the walleye population took hold. Glad you had a good trip, but I'm frankly not a big fan of Hawk Air."
757711,adempsey,2013-01-09 01:56:00,1498,Thanks for the report!  Looks like you all had a great time.  It reminds me of my brother and I when we were young.   We're in our 40's now and we still are doing the fishing trips with our father.  I am sure it will be the same for you guys.
757713,Acountdeleted,2013-01-09 01:57:00,2562,Sometimes the anticipation makes catching fish that much more enjoyable. Great report.
757719,hoosier,2013-01-09 02:12:00,29,Thanks for the comments everybody.   Not for sure about 2013 yet but 2014 for sure.    Correct on the stocking. I think the walleye have been in the lake for about 10-12 years.   That would be a little bit of heaven if my boys and I end up doing the same.
757755,freddyp,2013-01-09 05:33:00,27,Great report!
