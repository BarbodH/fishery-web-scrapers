757800,adempsey,2013-01-09 16:16:00,1498,I am surprised since they put all that advertising in it now.
757858,irishfield,2013-01-09 19:16:00,26272,"Yep..advertisers.. start calling them up in your quiet hours in the store... tell them ""Did you know"" and the printing presses should start back up."
757920,moxie,2013-01-09 22:34:00,1566,"Nice!!!! Can't follow the rules if I can't get a hold of a play book. It isn't up to us to seek information when we have paid dearly to have that taken care of that for us. MPs and MPPs don't listen to anyone but their masters for whom they tow party lines. Lip service seems to be the little we get in return for our dime, action must be a higher priced option."
757922,creekman,2013-01-09 22:50:00,18,Canadian Tire has a lot of regs out
757972,jim,2013-01-10 01:50:00,124,Qubec regs. are only available on line. A real suprise for any one coming to Quebec from other Prov' s or U.S.
757973,Dutch,2013-01-10 02:08:00,831,"Pretty common to for things to be available only online these days.  All those paper copies probably wound up in the garbage or recycling anyway.  The paper is thin and doesn't stand up to water or the elements.  They're available in PDF format on the Ministry website - easy to download and have avaialble on any phone, tablet or laptop out there.  This is a good move."
757978,whiskywizard,2013-01-10 02:16:00,305,"Finally, the voice of reason! I keep my regs as .pdf copies on my phone. Always with me, always current.  Anyone thinking they have to possess a paper version before they'll be held to those regs is only fooling themselves."
757981,jedimaster,2013-01-10 02:34:00,3472,I personally like the idea of not printing any more regs on paper. This should lower the cost of our fishing licenses as they used to pay to print them.... holding my breath....
757982,jedimaster,2013-01-10 02:35:00,3472,On second thought I better start breathing again.
