757979,Joeytier,2013-01-10 02:20:00,3990,mmmm...sure is
757980,vinnimon,2013-01-10 02:30:00,2593,Sure looks like one
757988,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-10 03:02:00,10439,UH HUH!!!
758003,Nipfisher,2013-01-10 03:50:00,2449,Just a little Smelt thogh.
758006,BucktownAngler,2013-01-10 04:51:00,582,this is a smelt  
758025,Rich,2013-01-10 11:25:00,3927,I thought limey's was an alewife..?
758028,Roy,2013-01-10 11:57:00,13728,Both pics are smelts. Alewife has a rounder body.
758078,4x4bassin,2013-01-10 16:56:00,1025,"Maybe a cisco , but either way it would look good on a jig !"
758083,adolson,2013-01-10 17:10:00,783,That second one is an Atlantic.
758084,mpt,2013-01-10 17:13:00,158,"If it doesn't have an adipose fin, just before the tail, it's not a smelt. Can't tell from your pic.  "
758091,Jon,2013-01-10 17:22:00,209,"Great point about the adipose. Could eliminate Smelt really easily if there is no adipose.  Another way of telling if the fish is alive and in hand - smell it. If it smells like cucumbers, Rainbow Smelt.  My guess would be Emerald Shiner.  Jon"
758149,misfish,2013-01-10 21:09:00,29133,Simcoe use to have alot that size. They called them rainbow smelt.
758150,Christopheraaron,2013-01-10 21:19:00,3525,THIS is a smelt!  
758251,camillj,2013-01-11 03:47:00,1988,Actually  that last one looks alot more like a (salt-water) mulllet
