757249,misfish,2013-01-07 20:58:00,29133,"When  Live2fish85 asked if I wanted a few home made pike flys,I said sure. Today I got more then I expected,and cannot wait to flick these baits for some early season pike. Im sure the bass will kill them as well.  A big shout out to ya brother.  They are awesome.  Thanks a bunch.   "
757252,Rod Caster,2013-01-07 21:03:00,5784,Noice!
757256,Christopheraaron,2013-01-07 21:07:00,3525,Nice!
757257,kickingfrog,2013-01-07 21:07:00,8333,Kidz wear those as earrings.  Nice feathers.
757264,Spiel,2013-01-07 21:24:00,9065,Good stuff B and nice work Chris. I don't see you having to much trouble with your first lesson tomorrow Chris.
757269,davey buoy,2013-01-07 21:33:00,5505,"What a variety Brian!,Something to look forward to spring:good:"
757272,dhickey,2013-01-07 21:38:00,1038,  Nice I know of a little spot where those would get gobbled up in a hartbeat.  Well done
757307,Rustic-Fisher,2013-01-07 23:19:00,826,Those red and white patterns look deadly !!!
757308,BucktownAngler,2013-01-07 23:22:00,582,very nice  can you throw those with a spinning setup?  are they weighted at all?
757311,misfish,2013-01-07 23:28:00,29133,"You could with some I would think,but the head weight is light.  I,m just looking forward to throwing them with the fly rod and ripping line and getting a smash.  My fav is the  middle one,second row. it,s got good head weight. I can see it diving as I rip the line,then popping up."
757329,Christopheraaron,2013-01-07 23:57:00,3525," There's only so much you can weight them, they feel like the lightest crappie jigs you've ever used on spinning gear, but put one on a fly rod and it feels like you're whipping around a 6 oz weight!"
757339,kickingfrog,2013-01-08 00:10:00,8333,"The wind resistance also factors into things, not to mention the line and rod that you could cast the flies with would be less than ideal for fighting the fish targeted."
757441,BillM,2013-01-08 04:36:00,17367,You aren't tossing those things with spinning gear.  You'll have a hard enough of a time tossing them with fly gear unless you've got some meat to your setup.
757459,mercman,2013-01-08 12:05:00,7054,"Nice haul !!!! Chris is one of the members that i have really gotten to know. He is a stand up guy and a true gentleman. He and i have shared many PM's during the few years i have been in here.Some happy, some sad, and i consider him one of my closest friends. Great job bud!!!  And post the pics of anything you catch on them Brian. I'd love to see them:good:"
757465,cuzza,2013-01-08 12:37:00,467,"Nice ties Chris! Top right would be first out of the box for me  Was making a list of materials yesterday to get some pike flies tied up myself, much more satisfying than making a size 16 soft hackle!"
757474,Live2fish85,2013-01-08 13:12:00,1633,"Brian, I am glad they finally got to you, glad you like them as well. Some of the beefy flies have a heavy barbell weight and have a heavier led wrapped around the shank to help get them down.  As for the colors, I have caught some pike on the red styles and the chart, the gar pike like the orange ones though.  I have no troubles tossing them with my 8wt.  Brian if you want this summer I could get you out on Long Point bay and catch a ton of pike, most of them are little guys but still a blast on the fly."
757481,I'mHooked,2013-01-08 13:43:00,525,Nice looking flies!
757558,misfish,2013-01-08 18:57:00,29133, That sounds like a blast.
758098,mpt,2013-01-10 18:07:00,158,"Chris,  Can you ship south of the border? Beautiful work."
758127,Christopheraaron,2013-01-10 20:19:00,3525,"Just noticed that top middle one, that's my first, I do love the old red and whites, can't beat the classics"
