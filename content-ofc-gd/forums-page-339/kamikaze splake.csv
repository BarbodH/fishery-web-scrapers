Hit a productive splake lake with relatively high expectations, which were exceeded greatly with an absolutely insane mid-afternoon flurry of action.  Fish came in waves, which is typical of splake, and had a couple bursts of action that produced 6-7 fish in under 30 minutes between 4 lines.  Fish were primarily small, which I was more than okay since it's tough to beat a small char in terms of table fare.  Was hoping for big bertha to rear her head at dusk but it wasn't meant to be.  Next time...  Stationed out around a high current area in 6-10 FOW...     splitshot and a shiner was all that was needed but I was experimenting with williams spoons and a dropper rig and produced a good number of fish on it as well...     Splake a-la stick is always a treat...   Still waiting for lakers to open up here but these guys are filling the void nicely!"
