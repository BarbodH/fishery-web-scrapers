757901,camillj,2013-01-09 21:40:00,1988,"So here's the scoop sports fans .... I could go ice fishing in beautiful Muskoka on Monday Jan 28th ...  or I can play for the Toronto Maple Leafs Alumni  at the Powerade Centre with the likes of Darryl Sittler, Darcy Tucker, Gary Lehman, Mike Palmateer (coached by Johnnie Bower) ...  Any guess which choice I've made ???   Anyhow any one wanting to see a long-in-the-tooth  OFNCer don a Leafs Jersey (once and probably only once) ... let me know (tickets are also available at ticket master)  I can assure you this opportunity came not because of any particular on-ice skill .. other than the skill of giving to charity  But I am right now headed out to the outdoor rink - stick in hand - to see if I can last a shift or two with some of  my HERO's !!!  "
757905,Joeytier,2013-01-09 21:50:00,3990,I'll be fishing
757906,lhousesoccer,2013-01-09 21:52:00,442,"Fishing or Hockey?  As a Canadian, the correct answer is BOTH!"
757909,davey buoy,2013-01-09 22:02:00,5505,"I think over the winter,you'll be able to get enough fishing in.  . Sounds like a fun time."
757912,Christopheraaron,2013-01-09 22:10:00,3525,"Well, as much as I love watching hockey, I absolutely stink at it, so I'll take fishing  Have fun with some of the greats!"
757961,Toad Hunter,2013-01-10 00:41:00,261,I would think you're asking the wrong forum lol but sounds like a great oppertunity
757965,jedimaster,2013-01-10 01:16:00,3472,Are you playing indoors or out on a lake? If on a lake you have the perfect opportunity to drop a tip up and play hockey.
757999,asdve23rveavwa,2013-01-10 03:39:00,2690,"Sounds like fun, I say go for it! Any other time....Fishing!!!!!!!!!"
758040,craigdritchie,2013-01-10 13:23:00,1586,"What's ""hockey"" ?????  (understand, I live near Toronto, it doesn't exist around here)"
758042,Fish Farmer,2013-01-10 13:30:00,2234,Wouldn't waste my time if I could go fishin.
758048,fishindevil,2013-01-10 13:49:00,6254,there is no comparison !!!!  FISHING IS IT......
758051,solopaddler,2013-01-10 13:57:00,8605,"That is truly awesome! Whatever you did to merit this opportunity it must have been something special, good on you. Have fun, it should be an amazing experience."
758053,Jds63,2013-01-10 14:01:00,1365,"thats awseome ... ask your agent if he can sign me up if I donate $100 ...  lots of chances to fish, this is an oppotunity that doesn't come up every day ... I think Tucker could still be a good addition for the current Leafs roster to replace Connolly (2 yrs 9.5 million)"
758058,Skipper D,2013-01-10 14:24:00,1970,"Go play , and for fun invite them back here to become members so we can get out fishing with them .... lol"
758113,Acountdeleted,2013-01-10 19:17:00,2562,"I don't blame you, I would take the same decision, but as an overall question I would take hockey because as I once told my buddy 'If all the other anglers go on strike or get locked out, its more fish for me.'  And as for the fish going on strike........ well I've had that happen more then once when I go out."
758133,Billy Bob,2013-01-10 20:46:00,5865,They tell me there was no hockey for over 100 days.....  ...never noticed....   DON'T EVER TRY THAT WITH FISHING....
758247,camillj,2013-01-11 03:41:00,1988,Well .. with these warm temps I am not sure about getting out on the ice (for lakers) ... but gonna give it a try over the next few days ... can't skate in this heat anyways  But starting next week its the high protien - high carb - high octane diet alll the way to the puck-drop !
758270,Guest,2013-01-11 10:49:00,0,You should tell Darcy Tucker that he skates like a girl
