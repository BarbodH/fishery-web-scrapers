758139,Gerritt,2013-01-10 20:51:00,6129,"Looking to have new hardwood installed in my house in Brighton... I have had a couple of quotes but thought I would offer up the job to members of OFC as well. I have 915sqf that need replacing in a 1800sqf (main floor) bungalow... three wide steps (treads and risers) and two reducers needed for bathrooms...  We are looking at white oak in a wheat colour with a matte finish for the main area... due to my dog (less noticeable scratches) and tiger eye in the bedrooms (darker colour)  not alot of cuts involved... Main living/dining room, hallway and the three upstairs bedrooms...3 closets and a linen closet.  I would easily do this myself...being a carpenter... but my job does not afford me the time to have it done in a timely manner.  I would be willing to supply the materials if need be.  Cash payment.   If you are out there... send me a PM or post here.  G "
