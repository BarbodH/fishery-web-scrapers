Off in the morning twilight to see if the big girls are hitting the early buffet table.    I was hoping for a repeat of yesterday when I had as soon as I put my dead stick down. The first fish of the day was this nice 36 incher.    It wasn't nearly as good a bite as yesterday and the fish were a lot more timid. The dead stick was outfishing the jig. I did get quite a few fish and lost a giant at the hole on the dead stick as well as breaking off another giant on my jig stick. Finally got that fish I've been after around 1PM. This bruiser taped out around 43"" and hit a black/white Northland Airplane jig.    :good:    "
