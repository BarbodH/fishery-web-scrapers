I will work on getting this format worked out, then we will ad a skin or two thats easier on the eyes... just need time and patience form everyone."
757575,davey buoy,2013-01-08 19:54:00,5505,"The format looks great,the old wood/veneer finish was the best imo.I'm sure you will get that fixed up  .."

757507,Roy,2013-01-08 17:03:00,13728,"No, you cannot. Sorry, it was the one I used as well. We're up and running with major work having been done. Skin should be the least of our worries for the time being.  Now we need to clean up and oick up the pieces."

757510,jedimaster,2013-01-08 17:05:00,3472,"I like the old look better.. I tend to stay away from forums with stark white backgrounds, too hard on the eyes."
757511,Skipper D,2013-01-08 17:07:00,1970,"You's are doing a fine job , i just had to say some thing to see if the place was still working ."
757514,Roy,2013-01-08 17:09:00,13728,Club is not compatible with this board version. It might show up but it's not stable. Thanks.
757515,TJQ,2013-01-08 17:12:00,7806,Over the next bit we will be looking at some new skins..  i like this but i know that the old site had a nice cozy feel to it... just give us a bit of time.
757516,Mike Pike,2013-01-08 17:13:00,1332,It wasn't real wood grain though.  lol
