757915,moxie,2013-01-09 22:25:00,1566,Is nothing sacred? Sheesh!!!
758016,Rich,2013-01-10 10:45:00,3927,How do you know he had it coming? Lol no details about the relationship are given..  I'd kill her.
758030,Rich Nelson,2013-01-10 12:41:00,332,  Maybe not the best choice of words on a public forum...
758056,Rich,2013-01-10 14:21:00,3927,"Why? If that lady auctions off my fishing spots, ill worry about my threat. Otherwise i dunno who she is. Nor her me. So my words are fine."

758076,Beans,2013-01-10 16:56:00,3339,"I guess you could say ""twit for tat""...  I wonder what a ""tat"" is ?"
758088,Grimace,2013-01-10 17:17:00,2020,I am going to put a bunch of random way points on my unit and sell it as a bunch of secret fishing spots and see what I get on eBay.
758148,hockeyplayerz_14,2013-01-10 21:08:00,160,"imo as a young guy i know all about these fake news cast and stuff like that. why would someone spend 3 grand on random spots? i could pin point spots on a lake and say ""ya tons of fish"" and get 3 grand for it? as a fishermen i would not spend 3 grand on ""secret spots"""
