758172,Christopheraaron,2013-01-10 22:13:00,3525,Nice! (Only took me like 5 seconds to load  )
758183,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-10 22:43:00,10439,Me too. I was just relaying the info from Simms about load times. Probably take a while on dialup.

758189,solopaddler,2013-01-10 23:11:00,8605,Whew! Missed it.
758245,BillM,2013-01-11 03:32:00,17367,This camo trend is disturbing.
758252,Bondar,2013-01-11 03:48:00,817,I have the bulkley jacket and love it!  So much I wear it everywhere but fishing LOL
