757990,limeyangler,2013-01-10 03:16:00,5204,How the hell did i miss this post!  Awesome job boys.  How deep were you using your gopro?....how did you rig it for underwater?  Is the marcum better in low light because it has infrared lights on the camera?   Fantastic fish too guys....that walleye was a piggy!
758013,Terry,2013-01-10 10:22:00,14456,"no I never use the lights I am hoping I can tweak the gopro settings and get better resaults, but time will tell"
