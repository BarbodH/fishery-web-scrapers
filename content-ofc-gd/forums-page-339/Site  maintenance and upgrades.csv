756340,Roy,2013-01-04 18:19:00,13728,We will be performing site maintenance and needed upgrades within the next few days. We don't know whether we will be down for any length of time so this post is just a heads up. The upgrades have mostly to do with security enhancement but will probably give us a few more bells and whistles. We will do everything to make it as painless as possible. Thanks for understanding.
756341,aplumma,2013-01-04 18:21:00,6896,Good to hear thanks for all of your hard work Roy and for keeping us healthy. A bug free site is a happy site.    Art
757375,Muskieman,2013-01-08 01:26:00,2472,"will there be a ""LIKE "" button ?"
757379,kickingfrog,2013-01-08 01:38:00,8333,"Only if there is an ""unlike"" button and a ""meh"" button."
757527,Muskieman,2013-01-08 17:29:00,2472,Ok ... It's working fine with the new layout on mobile (iPhone ) ... I logged on to my PC and attempted to change the theme to Club and it booted me out after I tried to change it back to IP...

757534,Jacques,2013-01-08 18:04:00,97,"New format looks clean, works great!  Thanks for all the work you guys do on this board."
757561,fishnsled,2013-01-08 19:22:00,3520,"Well I wouldn't say it looks clean at all, at least when I'm logged in - everything is all over the place.  When I log out, everything looks good."
757562,wkrp,2013-01-08 19:29:00,656,I like it!
757608,craigdritchie,2013-01-08 21:18:00,1586,"Seems to be working just fine for me, on both my Macbook Pro and my iPad. Tried it with Firefox and Safari on the Macbook, as well as Safari on the iPad. Nice job!"
757613,Terry,2013-01-08 21:26:00,14456,Right now my ipod is the only way I can read threads or post.
757702,NAW,2013-01-09 01:23:00,4022,All good for me so far.  Only logged in on one of my 4 usual devices though...  So we'll see. I do like the new format!
757703,NAW,2013-01-09 01:25:00,4022,"Well  I just tried to edit the post above.  But I was not able to save my changes unless I went in to the ""full Editor"" and saved them with that.  Weird."
757830,camillj,2013-01-09 18:05:00,1988,Is the old 'skin' gone ... can't seem to find where I set that
757985,ChrisK,2013-01-10 02:46:00,2772,Personal messenger doesn't seem to be working in the drop down
758094,Christopheraaron,2013-01-10 17:49:00,3525,When do you think we'll be able to use the other skins again?
758102,Roy,2013-01-10 18:16:00,13728," We won't, Christopher. They're unusable. We're looking at new ones."
758111,Christopheraaron,2013-01-10 19:11:00,3525,"Oh, ok. Will there be something similar?"
758126,Roy,2013-01-10 20:17:00,13728,Yes there will be.
758135,Christopheraaron,2013-01-10 20:48:00,3525,"Ok cool, the other look made it feel different and special compared to the other sites, just liked it that way"
