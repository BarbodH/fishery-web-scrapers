756846,nancur373,2013-01-06 17:23:00,1211,Hey guys. I want to take my 5 year old son out tomorrow. Would VB or Port Bolster be best? Just want to put him on fish. Size don't matter? Any help appreciated guys.
756892,BillM,2013-01-06 19:14:00,17367,Tomorrow is going to be a slushfest with these warm temps.   Be careful.
756956,nancur373,2013-01-06 22:24:00,1211,Low of -14 tonight and high of -3 tomorrow afternoon. hopefully it will tighten up tonight.
756963,BillM,2013-01-06 22:57:00,17367,Looks like that warm weather got pushed back a day!
757045,iFish4real,2013-01-07 02:07:00,386,"went to VB yesterday, came home with 14 keepers, lots of small ones, bite was bellow average I'd say, we could see the fish through the holes kissing the minnow and swim away  ...in the afternoon it died completely ice was 6-7"""
757059,nancur373,2013-01-07 02:58:00,1211,Thanks for the info guys. Thinking we may go to Port Bolster due to the 3 hour limit at VB
757070,nancur373,2013-01-07 03:41:00,1211,Where do you park in Port Bolster
757072,Guest,2013-01-07 03:43:00,0, Is there a three hour parking limit at Virgina Beach?
757073,nancur373,2013-01-07 04:07:00,1211,apparently on Hadden Road
757085,tapout,2013-01-07 04:38:00,166,I was there yesterday (Saturday) and parked from 7am to about 5 pm and no ticket.  Maybe its a weekday thing?  No signs posted anywhere that I could see.
757227,iFish4real,2013-01-07 19:47:00,386," same here...never knew about any parking limit, and no signs..."
757343,Locnar,2013-01-08 00:15:00,645,You guys think the ice will be solid enough to give'r a go for some Jumbos this weekend? Even with the brutally warm weather?
757364,misfish,2013-01-08 00:59:00,29133,"Sure m glad ,my mind is not on Simcoe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Thanks for back lakes,up nord."
757416,asdve23rveavwa,2013-01-08 02:52:00,2690, That's the bonus thing about living in the Barrie area Brian. Takes me 2 hrs just to get to Simcoe!
757419,Christopheraaron,2013-01-08 03:01:00,3525, I hope so! But if it's not safe I guess I'll try to sneak off around the muskokas
