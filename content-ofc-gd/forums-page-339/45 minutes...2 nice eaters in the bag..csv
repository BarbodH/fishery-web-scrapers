Finally wind died down, 2:30pm...hmmmmmm...not long considering nothing packed to go...ahhhh...screw it...just go for an hour....will be nice to get out!        In the end 4 fish iced.....3 of them in the first half hour....then one right at the end....got home before dark with 2 in the bag...nice way to spend an hour or so...at least i think so.  70'FOW, jig and minnows.....and 3 split shot and a circle hook with 18"" fluro leader on the set rod....set rod had 6""-7"" minnows.  Not many big fish in this lake (except for the walleye which are humungous and conspicuous by their absence) but always plenty of action with the smaller trout and ling in the winter."
