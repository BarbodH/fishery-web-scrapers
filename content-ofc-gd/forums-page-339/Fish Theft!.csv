757478,Rich,2013-01-08 13:38:00,3927,"haha, yep, made the same mistake fishing from a paddle boat at my grandmas cottage, twice! Once left a stringer of perch for a snapping turtle to eat like a chicken wing at the dock while i had lunch. Thought i had him beat next time, used a 5 gallon pail, went up for lunch.. oops this time the bear found it! Lmao"
757482,jedimaster,2013-01-08 13:44:00,3472,Lost a stringer of speckles in algonquin about 15 years ago to a snapping turtle. Also my brother had a hot dog stolen from him by a seagull on the beach right out of his hands.
757483,Christopheraaron,2013-01-08 13:49:00,3525," LOL! Happened to me too, those things don't get scared easily!"
757488,Fish Farmer,2013-01-08 14:16:00,2234,"Funny Rich, I'll tell you a story, it's true. A friend of mine was at 50 PT. fishing and fell asleep in his chair. When he woke up, someone had stolen his net he had on the ground behind him. True story, I don't think it was a seagull"

757620,ChrisK,2013-01-08 21:47:00,2772,I was in Dryden one year moose hunting and decided to go do some fishing. Caught some pike and decided to clean them. As I  filleted the pike I place the meat on a rock behind me. When I was done I turned around to get my fillets and caught a mink carrying off the last of the fillets to his lair which unbeknown to me was just a couple feet away from my pile of fish.  Bonappetit  !!
757664,GoneFishin,2013-01-08 23:15:00,349,"That must have left a crappie taste in your mouth haha....... There was a lake up north near camp that had lots of specks. My grandfather lost almost a full limit and thought maybe turtles got them or they some how shook off the stringer. He put another one on and almost lost it too, it was otters.. They moved in and cleaned the small lake out completely.. "
757668,skeeter,2013-01-08 23:24:00,1907,"Had a friend up to the ice hut fishing. When he left he took all the perch with him. I didn't think his name was ""perchslayer"". "
757695,Lunker Larry,2013-01-09 00:51:00,122,"The same thing almost happened to me. Had a half dozen trout on the ice in Gander, NFLD. Me and my dog were fishing and watching a spaniel run around steeling peoples fish. When he started coming towards us, my dog Max got up and steered him away about a half dozen times. The spaniel finally gave up and left. Max came back and laid back down. I never said a word the whole time. What a great dog he was."
