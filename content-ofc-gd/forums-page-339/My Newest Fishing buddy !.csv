757646,Toad Hunter,2013-01-08 22:54:00,261,"hey all, I know you guys don't know me personally, as many of you all do each other. But I have the new father bug and have to share with anyone that will listen. I am proud to show off my new fishing buddy Liam Austin Dykes (my we ""LAD""). He was born Sat. night around 630 pm and all was well until we noticed some jaundice and had to have him in the ""tanning salon"" for just over 24 hours . But he was finally able to come home with us and Natacia and I are just glowing. I think the only feeling that could match this is when I first hear him tell me ""daddy I think I got one!"" (even if its just a snag). And as long as he doesn't out fish me, he will be welcome in my boat any day. Thanx for letting my gloat and Hope everyone is enjoying the day as much as I have. "
757651,cowanjo,2013-01-08 23:01:00,249,"Awesome enjoy some time, and yes he will eventually outfish you and take your boat"
757654,chris.brock,2013-01-08 23:08:00,4053,"very cool, you must be ecstatic  put a Leafs jersey on the little guy and I would have written more  congrats"
757655,bigbuck,2013-01-08 23:10:00,2449,"Prepare yourself for, 'Dad, I need the boat to go fishing this weekend with my buds and NO, you can't come. ' Congrats!!"
757656,Toad Hunter,2013-01-08 23:10:00,261," Not in my house- we're a Blueshirts family (we already cheer for a losing football team, no way we want to waste money rootin for a losing hockey team as well  )"
757659,mr blizzard,2013-01-08 23:13:00,1589,"Congrats to all of you, best time of your life, and a very special one. I remember when my son was born  i tried to miss every pothole possible bringing him home.  I kept saying to him fishing fishing fishing, but his first word was mmmmmum,  Down the road if u ever have disagreements kepp to a minimum and resolve quickly, it goes to fast, our son is 17, I wish I could turn the clocks back to when he was 7,  Cherish every day, all the best."
757660,irishfield,2013-01-08 23:14:00,26272,Congrats fella... it just gets more expensive from here on out!! LOL (but I wouldn't trade fatherhood for anything in the world!)
757669,lew,2013-01-08 23:26:00,12766,"Great news, having kids is the best thing that can happen to a person."
757670,TJQ,2013-01-08 23:33:00,7806,Woot!!!!

757672,ketchenany,2013-01-08 23:44:00,3229,"Congrats. Irish said it best, it will get more expensive, but they are great to have (I have 4 adult girls) they liked shoes and coach purses!"
757673,Wolf 3,2013-01-08 23:51:00,134,Congratulations!
757679,lookinforwalleye,2013-01-09 00:06:00,4399,Yes like the great dads above said there is know greater thrill than becoming a father for the first time I still remember the drive home from St.Mike's at 4 in the morning some 34 years ago!  I have 3 sons and yes I still write cheques!  Congrats.
757684,rmarentette,2013-01-09 00:17:00,124,Congratulations!

757705,NAW,2013-01-09 01:30:00,4022,Congrets man!  My 4 month old is screaming his head off right now.......
757706,solopaddler,2013-01-09 01:34:00,8605,"That's big news, congrat's!"
757708,Toad Hunter,2013-01-09 01:38:00,261,Thanks everyone for the kind words..  Then you better believe he's paying for gas   I can only hope the biggest disagreement is the age old walleye vs pickeral - And I've kept his receipt incase he grows up to be a NY Jets fan to spite his ol' man   You mean it doesn't stop at the cost of hospital parking ?
757717,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-01-09 02:05:00,310,Congrats!!! This new fishing partner is yours for life!!!
757783,outllaw,2013-01-09 14:17:00,1232,lews words times 2. congrats
757822,Rattletrap2,2013-01-09 17:36:00,1652,"Man, you have every right to be proud! Go ahead and gloat all you want. This board has always been about so much more than just ""fishing"". Everyone here takes an active interest in others lives, and that makes it so special. I personally am past the point of raising 3 wonderful adult Daughters ( all of whom I am extremely proud of!) and now I am moving on the the Grandchildren phase! It excites the hell out of me! LOL I can't wait to fish with my new Grandson. Even if he does not take an active interest in it, I will make sure he is exposed to fishing and gets the opportunity to see if he enjoys it. His Dad is an avid fisherman, so the little guy has a decent chance!  Enjoy and congrats to you!"
757847,Squid,2013-01-09 18:52:00,1656,WOP WOP Congrats Man!!
