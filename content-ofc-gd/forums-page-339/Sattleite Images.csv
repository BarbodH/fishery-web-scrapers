I know that there is google earth and bing maps, but the images from that are from back in 2003-2005. The reason I am asking this is because as most northerners know the logging roads change constantly in the area with some getting blocked off and new ones being built up. It would help me find potential lakes without burning any gas just to find out the roads been dug out."
