Although we are having a hard time finding one because theres so many! This park has to be withing 2-5 hours from hamilton, must be on a good fishing lake, must have water sites that you can have your own dock etc. Any of you had expierence with seasonal sites ? Any reccomendations?"

It is truly a great spot for families. Everything you need is within walking distance ie.groceries, liquor store, bakery, ice cream shop, and library. If you are interested, PM me for more details."
