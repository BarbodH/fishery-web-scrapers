756851,misfish,2013-01-06 17:31:00,29133,"Havent eaten a fresh water fish in about 9 or so years,I thought it was time to have one. Crappie is all I wanted,and crappie is all I got.  Walked out,found the weeds,and drilled back til I was on the edge of them.    Start fishing. Didnt take long and the first was up out of the hole.    A few minutes later,another.    Then this one,going close to 12 inches,smashed the small jig.    It was a good bite.  14 total for the few hours I was out,    Playing with macro again.    Kept 4 to eat for lunch.It was delis.  "
