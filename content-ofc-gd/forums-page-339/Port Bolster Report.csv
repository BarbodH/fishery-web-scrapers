757396,bobowski,2013-01-08 02:05:00,360,Decided to go fishing on Saturday. Got there as the sun was beginning to rise. The winds were calm and it was a decent temp to be out on the ice. The first half km walk out was brutal as it was mostly pack ice and was very jagged. after that the ice was surprisingly a lot better. There was 5+ inches of ice in most spots. The bite was off and on for the time I was there. I managed to take home 8 perch all 10+ inches with the biggest being about 12 inches. Even caught a Herring which was released. I fished for about 4 hours as I had to be back home for an afternoon appointment. It was a great day and a good start to my ice fishing season. And a tasty one.
