757791,Christopheraaron,2013-01-09 15:24:00,3525,"Yesterday Jeremy and I ventured out onto a few lakes in the richmond hill area, spent most of the morning on a new lake to us, we found a bunch of crappie there, just couldn't get them to hit, by 2 we decided it was a lost cause and we packed up. Next on the agenda was my secret perch spot, on the way we passed a good crappie lake, we stopped and fished it for 20 mins, Jeremy got one hit but that was it. So we continued to my pond, upon arrival as always this spot seems dead, but  it had good ice and I reassured Jeremy that this was a lively spot. So we drilled a couple holes and started looking, when he first put his transducer down there was nothing to mark, still he dropped down his jig and within seconds was getting bit. This is what his flasher looked like as soon as the jig went down...  http://s1148.beta.photobucket.com/user/minientrepreneur/media/IMG_0407_zps197bbcc6.mp4.html  It didn't matter what we did, but almost every drop I would have a fish before the bait got to bottom, we don't have many pics just cause the fishing was so hot, but here's one that I took that was roughly 10 inches (a lot were this size, and I've caught multiple 13 inchers out of this pond)    It started getting dark, then the cop came, apparently they had been getting many ""concerned calls"" (which I'm sure were complaints) from people who live around the lake. First the cop yelled to us from shore saying that the ice was unsafe, we told him that we had been checking every 10 feet or so and that it was fine, we were both wearing float suits, had ice picks and a rope. Then he said that it may be safe where we were but the area infront of us was very dangerous, then of course he walked across the extremely dangerous ice to get to us. He asked us to measure (hoping he could get us)  I stuck down my tape and it came back up at exactly 4"" of good ice,  he proceeded to ask us if we were keeping any, how we got in, if we had licences, we didn't want to keep arguing and find ourselves packing in the dark so we backed down and left, WE WILL BE BACK LOL. In the end we got about 80 perch in the couple hours we were there, and I had my first perch (new favourite   )"

757839,Joeytier,2013-01-09 18:40:00,3990,It is not an officers duty to dictate what is safe for law-abiding adults on public land.  I would've loved to be in your shoes for that one.  Good job boys.
757841,davey buoy,2013-01-09 18:43:00,5505,"I guess it was dark Joey,no need at that time to get into a altercation I .They use to yell at us years ago,but not once confronted us.I think you might be right?."
757844,Christopheraaron,2013-01-09 18:50:00,3525,"Ya, if it was earlier in the day we wouldn't of backed down, but we were just about to leave anyways"
757867,Acountdeleted,2013-01-09 19:26:00,2562,"Chris is young and sadly I look like I'm a lot younger then I actually am (I get ID'd all the time at the LCBO) the officer probably thought he knew better then these two young 'punk kids' and could intimidate us into leaving. I was going to give him a perch and wish him a merry christmas and ask him to leave us be. Whatever, it was still a fun day."
757875,Joeytier,2013-01-09 19:34:00,3990,You should've snuck a small perch into his pocket as he was leaving
757882,Christopheraaron,2013-01-09 19:53:00,3525,Lol!

758114,Acountdeleted,2013-01-10 19:19:00,2562,"Next time we go I'll try to get a video of what I called the 'Perch power up.' Turned on the flasher, nothing except the bottom, dropped my jig down and it was like the bottom was starting to redline. One straight red bar shooting up to where me jig was. I couldn't stop laughing when I saw it."
758115,NAW,2013-01-10 19:30:00,4022,I'm very surprised he came out on the ice..   I always thought they would never venture out on thin ice.  Specially with out any safety gear.  That cop was just plain stupid in my opinion...
758121,Acountdeleted,2013-01-10 20:08:00,2562,"The really funny thing is we were fishing only about 20-30 ft off of shore. If he had walked along the bank he could have yelled at us from there. Looking back at it, the whole situation is kinda funny."
758123,Christopheraaron,2013-01-10 20:09:00,3525,Especially after he said that as soon as he stepped on the ice cracked...
758124,Christopheraaron,2013-01-10 20:10:00,3525,"Ya, I kinda hope he comes next time, lol"
758130,Billy Bob,2013-01-10 20:42:00,5865,"I'm confused....you said it was your secret perch spot...caught them there before, but you last sentence said you caught your first perch...."
758134,Christopheraaron,2013-01-10 20:46:00,3525,"Haha, sorry, ate my first perch  (first perch through the ice too)"
758204,fishindevil,2013-01-11 00:04:00,6254,It's always the same most cops know nothing about fishing regs or practices !!!! They try and think they do but they don't !!! Another member from the board and I were fishing scugog and the cops came up to us while we were trolling and seen my floating marker bouys out  that were marking a weed edge and he hassled me unreal telling me they were not even legal !!!!! Hahaha he didn't even know what they were !!!! Just clowns ..... They should stick to knowing cop stuff not about fishing or related stuff like ice safety and gear .....
758208,Christopheraaron,2013-01-11 00:14:00,3525,"LOL, I half expected to hear that he said you were littering!"
758215,Terry,2013-01-11 02:30:00,14456,   
758217,NAW,2013-01-11 02:31:00,4022, Well the Ice only cracks when its forming.  She must be good to go!
758220,Christopheraaron,2013-01-11 02:36:00,3525,"LOL, ya, but simcoe is like 50 000 times bigger then this pond!"
