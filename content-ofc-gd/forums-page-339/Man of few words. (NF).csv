His wife was standing there at the bench watching him. After a long period of silence, she finally speaks. ""Honey, I've been thinking. Now that we are married, I think it's time you quit hunting, shooting, hand-loading and fishing. Maybe you should sell your guns and boat.""Tim gets this horrified look on his face.She says, ""Darling , what's wrong?""”There for a minute you were sounding like my ex-wife.”""Ex-wife!"" she screams, ""I didn't know you were married before!""”I wasn't!“"
