647244,manitoubass2,2011-12-11 03:27:00,11391,"Mir in the second round, but hopefully I'm wrong  Can't lose that way, lol. But seriously, I'd rather see Nog win  all I can say is wow! who would have ever thought it would end like that? lol"
647246,woodenboater,2011-12-11 03:29:00,2277,"as long as Machida can beat Jones, I'll be happy."
647247,Dan668,2011-12-11 03:32:00,1120,"Lol big nog is a joke. Thought he had him, mir looked like crap"
647249,Dan668,2011-12-11 03:33:00,1120,"Up until that sub haha, did he break his arm?"
647250,Gerritt,2011-12-11 03:34:00,6129,I dont think he will be writing any checks tonight... broken arm.  G
647251,Terry,2011-12-11 03:34:00,14456,wow did you see that arm break
647253,Wolf 3,2011-12-11 03:36:00,134,OUCH!
647255,manitoubass2,2011-12-11 03:38:00,11391,"was that an arm break? Looked to me like the shoulder joint went? Either way, damn, ouch!"
647256,Dan668,2011-12-11 03:38:00,1120,Surpised mir outrolled him on the ground. Nog shouldn't of went for a sub of his own
647257,Jigger,2011-12-11 03:39:00,1237,That was crazy! We may not see Nog anymore after that. Don't think anyone expected that!
647258,Dan668,2011-12-11 03:39:00,1120,"Ya he dislocated his shoulder, after seeing the slowmo it was clearer"
647262,Gerritt,2011-12-11 04:05:00,6129,wow standing choke.... great fight!
647263,Jigger,2011-12-11 04:06:00,1237,Jones is the real deal after that. Great fight indeed!
647264,Dan668,2011-12-11 04:10:00,1120,"Too bad, machida was outstriking him. It wasn't until he got caught with the elbow, seemed like he lost confidence or something, wasn't moving around much"
647270,Sebastian,2011-12-11 04:25:00,208,I dont know why it took Jones that long to go to the ground after losing in the striking. What a great win for Mir! Very unfortunate for Hominick. He will be back.
647297,Terry,2011-12-11 11:48:00,14456,Jones is the man
647317,woodenboater,2011-12-11 14:09:00,2277,"Still not big fan of JBJ. He really needs to move up a weight class imo, not because he's clearing out the div, because he's not really lhw imo. He's a scrawny hw  Wish the Hominick/ Zombie fight had gone MUCH longer, woulda been epic I think."
647323,bassman87,2011-12-11 14:35:00,586,LOL at picturing jon jones vs brock or overeem hahahah
647337,steverowbotham,2011-12-11 15:19:00,1800,Lol @ anyone doubting Jon Jones now
647338,woodenboater,2011-12-11 15:23:00,2277,give him a steady steak and taters diet and 20-30lbs and he would be at home as a hw and tool bork.
647344,Dan668,2011-12-11 15:44:00,1120,"Jones is talented, just hate how fake and classless he is. Theirs a vid somewhere on the internet that his own trainer tells him to check on Machida, get some fans.."
647178,Gerritt,2011-12-11 01:05:00,6129,Anyone have working links for tonight's PPV? Been awhile since I haven't had the time to watch the PPV's... so I figured karma can pay me back finally lol  G
647180,Terry,2011-12-11 01:10:00,14456,Deleted: beat you to it
647181,misfish,2011-12-11 01:11:00,29133,"Payed this time bud. I got a virus the last two times. New PC, aint taking the chance. Great card,and the free is awesome. ."
647182,Grimace,2011-12-11 01:11:00,2020,Is that all you could come up with Terry?  :-)
647183,misfish,2011-12-11 01:13:00,29133," NO THANKS BUD.   I will pay,when the cards are worth it."
647184,Dan668,2011-12-11 01:16:00,1120,"Machida, mir, lil nog, hominick, ebersole. Who you guys calling?"
647185,Terry,2011-12-11 01:17:00,14456,Deleted: beat you to it
647191,misfish,2011-12-11 01:24:00,29133," Jones. both nogs,hom an ebe."
647192,Jigger,2011-12-11 01:24:00,1237,I really hope Mir gets his a$$ handed to him tonight. Would love to say Machida. Jones reach just might be too much. I'll second danbob with the rest.
647193,Nipfisher,2011-12-11 01:30:00,2449,http://www.firstrowsports.tv/sport/boxing-wwe-ufc.html    This one has worked for me the last few times. Not sure about tonight as it hasn't started but looks like it will.
647196,Dan668,2011-12-11 01:35:00,1120,"I still think mir will be too much for big nog, as much as I hate mir. Jones reach will be a prob, I hope machida ko's him though"
647198,Jigger,2011-12-11 01:43:00,1237,"As much as Mir beat on him the last fight, Nog looked awesome against Schaub in Rio. I think we'll see a much diffferent fight this time around. Jeez, Mir weighed in at 260! Dont know what he weighed the last time around, but I don't see him being very fast lugging that sort of weight around."
647200,misfish,2011-12-11 01:46:00,29133,I read that the MAN is coming back soon.
647202,bassman87,2011-12-11 01:51:00,586, 
647206,misfish,2011-12-11 02:00:00,29133,"Not TANK,but he was one hell of a guy that could giver and take.  Im talking   "
647210,bassman87,2011-12-11 02:11:00,586,
647211,Jigger,2011-12-11 02:12:00,1237,War Hominick!!!
647216,bassman87,2011-12-11 02:20:00,586, i think it took longer for you to type that than for the fight to finish
647217,Jigger,2011-12-11 02:20:00,1237,"wow, you're not kidding!"
647218,Terry,2011-12-11 02:21:00,14456,well that's 7 seconds I will never get back
647219,Dan668,2011-12-11 02:22:00,1120,"Tough loss, came in with a looping hook, left himself undefended, good call cause he was out"
647221,manitoubass2,2011-12-11 02:28:00,11391,http://www.vipbox.tv/sports/boxing-wwe-ufc.html  good quality feeds once you close the two pop ups
647222,woodenboater,2011-12-11 02:28:00,2277,"7 seconds ?? wow. this is the same guy who fought to the end in spite of a nasty hematoma, courtesy aldo so I would never have predicted this.  I feel bad for hominick."
647233,Dan668,2011-12-11 02:50:00,1120,Yup especially with his trainer passing away not too long ago.
647243,Gerritt,2011-12-11 03:22:00,6129,"  Thank you! Tito.. got his butt handed to him! looks good on him... afterall... he has Jenna Jamison to ""lick"" his wounds.  G."
