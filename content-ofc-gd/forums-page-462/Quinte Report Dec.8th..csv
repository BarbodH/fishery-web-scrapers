646757,Fish Farmer,2011-12-09 14:25:00,2234,"0 Fish Caught, 2 days, 4 guys. Some people that jigged caught fish, if you wanted to call them keepers. We saw people filleting 10""ers, what a shame.   Biggest fish we saw from the jiggers were about 4 Lbs. We trolled our 2 days looking for MR BIG, NADA. Last day wind was up to 45 K's, ""brutal"" My excuse, wrong brand of refreshments Boats away now. Ice fishing stuff is out and waiting"
646760,Roy,2011-12-09 14:30:00,13728,"Good on ya for sticking it out, Dave. Ice fishing is almost warm compared to 45K winds in a boat this time of the year."
646770,mike rousseau,2011-12-09 14:56:00,4661,That sucks....  I'll give u an A for effort....
646773,Joey,2011-12-09 15:01:00,9122,Sorry to hear that Dave.  At least you gave it a try.  C'mon ice fishing season

646813,fishnsled,2011-12-09 16:20:00,3520,"  Boats away??!! Next week is looking great.....well except for the winds again... ""A"" for your efforts Dave, a shame that guys are that desperate for a fish fry that they are keeping 10"" cigars.  I'm hoping for one (maybe 2) more trips but we'll see how mother nature is over the next few days. Thanks for the report."
