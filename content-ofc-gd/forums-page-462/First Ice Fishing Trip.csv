I was very deliberate at first, punching holes every 3feet, with a rope at arms length. We threw large rocks on the surface and jumped around but the ice was solid and did not crack at all....so we fished   Usually I catch smallmouth bass hand over fist at this lake but this time was different. All I got was one small lake trout which was released. I'll wait a for another inch or two before I start looking for bass in the open water. Anyone have suggestions on where to look for bass in early winter?      "

647114,Leecher,2011-12-10 22:06:00,7832,Nice going Chad   You are more gutsy them me    I'd never set foot on ice if a rope was needed to feel secure  I much prefer to wait for a few more inches to build before venturing  Nice laker btw!!! Good on you Jacques
647116,mercman,2011-12-10 22:28:00,7054,First fish for ya through the ice this season!! Nice!! Whats the green thing hanging around your neck?
647121,Rod Caster,2011-12-10 22:44:00,5784,  Thanks Paul. Those are my icepicks... just incase.   Haha. I was being over-precausious at first. I was more comfortable after I realized the large black spots were actually solid ice.  It's been colder north of Marten River than it has been in NBay... should be a fair amount of ice in Temag by next week.
