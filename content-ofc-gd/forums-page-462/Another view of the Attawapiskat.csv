645883,bushart,2011-12-06 15:38:00,2628,Apparently 3rd party appointee was tossed today out of Attawapaskat  Once again this will not be an easy fix
645980,Stef,2011-12-06 22:59:00,63,"Another link (video report) with a point of view... lays much of the blame on the locals and wonders where Charlie Angus was over the past seven years he has been the member there.  http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/video/1305119208001#.TthH0YE5rm0.email  An interesting discussion, I see a lot of validity in what Moosebunk has to say....."
645989,Rod Caster,2011-12-06 23:24:00,5784," The reporter says ...""I don't think anyone in the media had heard of it before""..... The CBC has been mentioning Attawapiskat and reporting from that area for years.  He brought up some interesting issues, but reporters like this seem to be more interested in the ""big headline story"" than anything else. He had no previous interest or knowledge on this subject and basically speed read through summary's and other peoples reports to understand it and re-summed it up in 10 minutes with an angry tone of voice ... I suspect he is not painting the entire picture, in fact I'm sure he's not painting the entire picture.  Like Mr. Bunk suggested, very few people know the full story, including I; hopefully the reporting has been mostly accurate since this story broke.... all Canadians need to learn about this because we are all involved in it somehow."
645991,bushart,2011-12-06 23:26:00,2628,Sun News is the Conservative publication daily---well known  And Again----I watched Charlie Angus bring these issues up 2 years ago  And I'm not even aN NDP supporter  Lots of blame to share here---Sun publications is just spinning their side---Can't have King Stevie Tarnished in any manner
645995,Bernie,2011-12-06 23:50:00,3190, Why kick a 3rd party appointee out? Just shows they have things to hide there too.  Like has been said. The problem is from both sides. No one is blameless. There is much more to the story than what we hear.
646075,Moosebunk,2011-12-07 04:39:00,3970,"I'm not a political guy at all.  Don't follow much in media or Government.  As far as cold hard facts, when something like this comes up and it's time to take note, I'm usually behind the 8-ball and have to read to get up to speed...  The only real knowledge I have on the subject of Attawapiskat and FN's of the James Bay comes from having of course, lived there, and from sharing today a life with one who's first home community and identity has been founded within Cree culture and life.  My take on Ezra and the video...  Harsh... but as I said above, ""there will be some eye-opening and difficult truths,"" and he did make some valid points.  A Conservative point-of-view is as appropriate as any other political party's point of view.  Especially PC's maybe, as, we did vote them to power.  Ezra is wrong by my understanding on a few things though.  The school and hockey arena.  The school by my knowledge came before the ""Reg Louttit Sportsplex.""  My father-in-law while serving terms as Chief of Attawapiskat in the 90's, was to raise half of the costs locally and the Governement would match.  It took years, but he and his council did this through fund raising events and charitable donations.  The school was a mistake made being built where it is, but it was separate issue and had nothing to do with the school and arena being a competition of spent funds for one thing over the other.  The school is wrong to be where it is.  The school is built over toxic-waste.  What Torontonian or any other community parent sends their kids everyday to the dump for an education?  The arena... well, IMO it is probably the greatest pride and joy, most appropriately used, and important social pillar Skat has.  Dances, bingos, weddings, Pow-Wows, public skating, basketball/volleyball, weight room, hockey/broomball, fund raisers... you name it, the Sportsplex provides that plus  community togetherness.  A zamboni... YEP... kind of an important part of a hockey arena.  School versus Arena as Ezra says... it wasn't ever a competition of choice, it was two separate and important entities.  Ezra speaks of Angus's timing.  Why 7 years?  Well, the bad housing IMO was the same in 2000-2001 as it is now.  I used to bike and jog those streets and walk the wood's trails weekly when not living for my work in healthcare there.  I've seen every inch of that town, over and over again.  When I was there last in 2010 for 6 weeks, I could honestly tell you that it was in the best shape I had ever seen it.  One word IMO was the reason... DEBEERS.  Ezra was right... they are giving, and Skat doesn't appear to be abusing that.  But, I can only speculate as to why Angus has gone to the media now, I'll guess it could be for maybe these reasons...  First, Chief Theresa Spence and Grand Chief Louttit combined are the right people to finally have at his side. (there have been some questionable Attawapiskat Chiefs in my eyes over the last decade)...  Two, the real issue that there is an actual housing crisis and it is a health-risk to Canadians does exist.  Or maybe, Angus' move at this time is just NDP taking aim at Conservatives.  I want to believe it is because someone is waking up, looking around, not liking what they see, and becoming proactive.  Those proactive people... Theresa and Stan in all likelihood.  The validity of their action... 100% undeniably understandable.  Remember, under the Indian Act the people of that community on Reserve DO NOT, any of them, working or not, qualify for mortgages.  Housing is the responsibility of the Band, Gov. and tax-payer.  Tough crud for all involved really, but whatta ya do?  I remember doing a home visit to a single room trailer down the street from the hospital and finding out 16 people live in it.  In one exposed corner of the small room, toilet, beside wash sink, beside stove.  No furniture, nada.  Mattresses on the floor, clothes on those.  The reason I was there, treat impetego and/or scabies.  If someone asked me if that was a housing issue... yep!  There's plenty of it going on up there... yep!  If someone asked me to take a crap in front of 15 other family members... nope!  Like Chief Spence is saying to the media... accounting isn't the (or her) issue right now.  Third party people and their slowing the process isn't many peoples issue up there right now... it's the housing.  Third party people may be a requirement, but at the same time, to the local Chief acting on behalf of her people, I can see third party officials just being insulting.  That poor housing, leads to illnesses.  Impetego and scabies are something I see at most maybe a few times a year working down south, up there ya see it a few times a week, if not more.  And psychological and social implications of living in overcrowded make-shift homes is a whole other plague on that society.  I think Ezra's take and numbers on Band spending has had several rebuttles seen online.  Band misuse versus Government oversight versus status quo... who knows?  Tonnes of tax payers money. I have with my own eyes seen improvements in Attawapiskat but also a fair share of what is and likely always will be, the norm.  Unless hard choices and responsibility are taken on by many folks whom are inadvertently (or not) dragging down their own neighbors, then a new house built up there today will be reduced to an ice shanty in no time.  Seen it, and even after Kasheschewan got their 40 new homes some years back, I was told first hand over a few beers shared on the Polar Bear Express with the head contractor (whom had just finished his return to Kash) that by contract he was forced to let all other lined up jobs for the summer go, because he had to essentially rebuild a community a year after erecting it.  So much which was shiney and new was destroyed.  10 of the 40'ish houses were OK, some of the 40 had the insulation ripped out of the walls because it had been easier to obtain and burn in the stove, than going out in winter and getting wood.  In a sense... I can see why there is some reluctancy by the Government to act too quickly with the wads of money that will be needed.    But... what a catch 22 really... the sick and poorly housed versus quick and costly repair.  Ezra stated that Attawapiskat has been helped time and again by DeBeers and yet the people in turn blockaded the ice-road to demand more money.  I was there for a number of those years, it was Kasheschewan that did this, not Attawapiskat.  Kash was paid the millions (as I understand it) by DeBeers to go away and stop being gun-toting trolls on the roads.  It worked for Kash, so they did it a number of years in a row.  Skat benefits from the mine, Kash does not.  Kash was the northern Walkerton some years back... although the water had tested bad, the media hadn't a clue the reality of what was going on, as I understood it.  That's another story.  Why the crappy houses but yet new skidoos, trucks and TV's with the homes?  Why not?  Working or not, no mortgage payments, just susidized housing paid to the Band.  The little house is falling over because no one ever earned it and it's treated like trash.  It's the responsibility of the Band and tax-payer to keep it up to code.  Many do respect their homes and many don't in my opinion.  The skidoo though... the truck... those are actually bought or put on credit and directly affect the household finances and quality of life.  They will be treated better as these are status objects much like they would be to anyone, of any race.  It's been said, to have a community there in the first place is a waste of time.  It's not viable.  Well, whoever says that is forgetting, it's the Governement who wanted and pushed for them all to be there in the first place.  And even if they hadn't done that, it was once a place that suited the Cree just fine.  Viability is a non-issue to them.  I said it above, I'll say it again.  HARD CHOICES.  NEVER BLACK AND WHITE.  HEART VERSUS HEAD.  PEOPLE FINDING SELF WORTH AND BUILDING COMMUNITY PRIDE.  GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP.  The years in the north I spent, certainly shaped me during what were the most cognitive and rewarding years of my life, so far.  When Brenda's beloved sister and community educator died in Attawapiskat in 2008, returning there after a six year abscence the place moved me again in a way I'll never forget.  All stores closed, the local TV channels tuned in, and the streets cleared out.  Everyone in the church (or watching the broadcast from their homes) attended the funeral.  Three days the community supported all out-of-towners when finally, in the gymnasium at Brenda's fathers dream come true ""Reg Louttit Sportsplex,"" I shook the hands of about 800 people, alongside my 40 some closest family members.  That's a different and beautiful kind of Native and community pride, love and respect, of which I have never seen anytime down here.  It's just sad that it seems to only be hardship or emergency that brings about this total community transformation.  So hoping that Attawapiskat's peoples and leaders show the Nation what it takes to really heal short and long festering wounds.  Good, good people whom require the basic food, shelter, health and education, to hopefully one day go that next level I think they are capable of."
646084,Skipper D,2011-12-07 05:52:00,1970,I believe you just painted the most perfect picture here MB for every one to be able to step back and see them selves and made it clear for the rest of us to understand what needs to happen . Thank you

646112,Skipper D,2011-12-07 12:09:00,1970,  I wish i knew how to have it put on the front page of the Nationial Post this morning .
646199,Stef,2011-12-07 17:48:00,63,"Moosebunk... well written, honest and I think the best summary of the situation I have read.  Applies to the whole social assistance ""welfare"" dilema, not just to Attawapiskat or Kash.  I don't have to go to James Bay, I just look in my own neighborhood.  We have non First Nation homes and families here in similar situations.  I think there isn't a person on this site who wouldn't put out their hand to help out someone who's fallen on hard times and give them a lift back up... and do so happily with great self satisfaction.  But I also think there isn't a person on here who feels they must hold on to that hand forever, to the end of this generation and then unto the next as the children emulate the circumstances and conditions they have grown up in.  Dependancy isn't a natural human trait except for a baby, its a learned thing  Its a question of whether to give a person a fish or teach them how to fish,  building ""self worth"" as you mentioned (the individuals themselves) and changing the infrastructure (the governing bodies) to allow people the time and environment as well as the encouragement, opportunity and need/reward of making that change.  To fix the James Bay situations you have to fix that whole other question as well... a long process.  What to do for people in immediate need is more pressing."
646374,ehg,2011-12-08 03:25:00,2666,The replies to this thread far exceeded my expectations. Hopefully more folks will be attentive to this situation.

Send food, water, medicine and the skilled people to get this righted now! Deal with the attitudes later. It's that simple. We send out help internationally at the drop of a hat, let's do it for our own people."
646787,bigbuck,2011-12-09 15:14:00,2449,"It is simply not acceptable for this to go on in Canada!! Period!! We spend millions upon millions of dollars helping other countries and places when this goes on in our own backyard. Utter nonsense. We need to FIX THE PROBLEM, not just throw money at it. Where does every penny go?? The Auditor General needs to take a very close look using a microscope where every single dollar goes before it reaches the band level. I think there is definitely a bloated bureaucracy at work here. The bands have to do something at their level as well. There are social problems that are well known, alcohol and substance abuse need to be dealt with. We have a lot of problems here at home, can we not make them the focus of our efforts for a couple of years?? The media needs to pay attention to our domestic problems and not sensationalizing the problems abroad."

644970,Rod Caster,2011-12-02 22:14:00,5784,"Living in non-traditional-type houses, the people living in Attawapiskat and other similar places should be trained properly and provided with the proper equipment for building and maintaining these types of homes. Small wood mills, shops, tools and training opportunities. Even a modest house in that area can cost $1 000 000.00 to build because the materals and labour are shipped in from the south. These massive Gov. provisions end up being a huge money pit which ends up being a huge burden for the residents when they require support. This is difficult and nearly impossible to sustain... The Gov and religions are to blame for countless faults when it comes to our Natives and the locals are also to blame for not being very creative and pro-active when it comes to helping themselves. I honestly feel bad for both sides and I believe that Canada is in for some huge changes in regards to the Canadian-Native Nation.  Everyone is SO sensitive about this issue that it's like walking on egg shells....but nobody wants to walk at all.   Both sides need to be a little less sensitive and use  more logic to get out of this one."

645061,Moosebunk,2011-12-03 04:12:00,3970," And on that note...  This is an absolutely impossible topic to pick sides on...  Most people have little to no idea of what is real, what is media driven and what is total Bull.  It's difficult to even find a starting point and it's such a coin toss which points to weigh in on as, it's almost day-to-day or heart versus head, which call to make.  My opinions over the years on many things have flip-flopped often simply because of apathy, empathy, sympathy, anger or any other mood.  Aside from Angus who I've never met, Dr. John Waddell is a friend whom I've shared quite a few good times with in Skat and Moose, and who was my reference for new employment upon leaving the James Bay.  John is as straight a shooter as anyone I have ever known.  Grand Chief Stan Louttit is my wifes uncle.  He's an honest, good hearted soul who has acted on behalf of the Mushkego Territory and it's people for some time.  Attawapiskat Theresa Spence is friend to the family, but especially Bren's late sister.  Those are your four involved in the birth of what has now become the ""Attawapiskat Crisis.""   It's grey people, it's NEVER so black and white.  Very dim stuff at times to truly dwell on, believe me I have wondered many days and nights over many experiences that affected me directly.  Aboriginal peoples issues are global.  If it's not the micro-populace model of Attawpiskat it could be Australia...?  With 12 years of direct involvement, 10 years of living amongst the Cree on James Bay, 2 years living two blocks away from those homes in the video from Attawapiskat, and having married one of the communities most brilliant and loved daughters from that unique, tight-knit, isolated, and interesting community, I can tell anyone 100% that if you think you know all the answers to what will fix and should be done with this recent housing; and beyond that our Indian Affairs issues, then you are an ignorant and arrogant fool.  It just runs too deep for any full understanding.  As far as the housing... the video doesn't lie.  It's accurate as I remember life to be.  Nothing much has changed since 2000 to 2001 and 2008 & 2010.  It's beyond Toronto, beyond North Bay, beyond Moosonee and all the way into a world that opens the eyes to something pretty foreign to most Canadians.  It's a town that shapes itself, as much as it is shaped by where it is, and by whom and what support it.  To say that the housing crisis is a result of one thing or another is false.  It's everything... it really is.  And unfortunately for me it's too involved to lay it all out here.  I'm happy to see this for Attawapiskat though.  Something needs to be addressed and it's not really just the housing, or funding, or Governance... it's the eye-opening and often difficult, TRUTH.  It's having more people educated, Native and White, and finding a common ground and understood appreciation of, and by peoples from both races.  It's about both peoples all living up to their fullest potential and using what life tools are provided to acquire those life skills necessary in achieving a greater quality of self being, and ultimately community.  It's about taking responsibility and making the right choices.  No more free and lazy living under a blanket of grace provided by tax-payers; that going out to all our healthy welfare recipients Status and Non...  Start with maybe trying forced education and/or hours labored in order to qualify for a therefor earned convenience of having, money.  It could be a start.  Because in Attawapiskat alone... I could take a day and think up a hundred things the hugely unemployed could be doing for their monthly cheques... men, women, and school-aged children.  Self worth could be so altering for many souls there, and that would only help reshape that town and society full of good people which has many whom just aren't living up to their potential.  It's up to the wise of both peoples to really rethink then begin forcing some changes towards a better future. Because as Joe here agrees as well, the past few centuries haven't really worked out in anyones favor."
645099,ehg,2011-12-03 13:58:00,2666,  Thanks very much Drew for the insightful and informative words drawn from experience.  Was provided the link by a native friend who suggested that attention should be drawn to this plight. I have no clue or worthwhile opinion so am humbled and very grateful for your response.
645110,Grimace,2011-12-03 15:23:00,2020," I feel the same way.  Thanks for your contribution to this discussion Drew and thanks to ehg for bringing it up.  I know next to nothing about this but I will add one thing.   De Beers is making a killing from the diamond mines and they should be forced by the government to help or get out.  De Beers has made mountains of money in Africa and has not done anything but fuel tribalism, hatred and slavery amongst it's people.  They are not a trustworthy corporation (are any?) so the Canadian government in my (uneducated, ignorant and meaningless) opinion should tag some more demands on to the conditions of their mining license.  Transportation of materials seems to be a very large issue.  De Beers gets all sorts of mining equipment up there.  Wherever De Beers seems to go, they fill their boots as the people who live where they extract live in severe poverty.  We shouldn't allow that here."
645113,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-03 15:45:00,10439,"  DeBeers, BHP and Diavik do a lot for the people of the NWT. They employ a lot of the native people and pay them excellent wages. They do a lot for the communities and for us here in Yellowknife. Millions have been donated for many projects and causes in Yellowknife alone.  I don't see how DeBeers can be blamed for African tribal issues that have been going on since the dawn of man."
645286,Moosebunk,2011-12-04 13:32:00,3970," Agreed.  Same in Skat, but not as good a deal as in the NWT.  Not for money back, work and culture issues.  But still, agreed Dave.  There are some good things DeBeers are doing.   The future corporate interests towards ""The Ring Of Fire,"" are certainly going to shape Ontario's north even more.  For the better or worse of environment and people, remains unknown."

I'm surely hoping that the Band and Government can really come together and make such a community better on more levels than just housing.  Talking with different co-workers and friends today whom ask me about Skat, it's kinda just great that on any level, people are curious.  This is the window I believe, during which the stage could be set.  Keeping informed and interested should only keep that window open longer.

644814,ehg,2011-12-02 13:13:00,2666,Enjoyed reading this... http://apihtawikosisan.wordpress.com/2011/11/30/dealing-with-comments-about-attawapiskat/
644817,Grimace,2011-12-02 13:26:00,2020,"I read that yesterday, I found it very interesting and informative.   It explains that side alot better than I had previously understood.  I still do not understand the majority of the issues and quite honestly do not have the time to but this is a good short valuable read."
644822,Terry,2011-12-02 13:36:00,14456,well that is one side of the story  the government has the other side  and somewhere down the middle is the truth
644865,ehg,2011-12-02 15:29:00,2666,   Thanks for the thoughtful replies...  After seeing the amazing fish reports from area was interesting to read a different perspective of the place.
644869,kickingfrog,2011-12-02 15:56:00,8333,"For what it's worth, my understanding was that the reserve is near/on James bay and the fishing lodges are hundreds of km upstream."
644872,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-02 16:15:00,10439,"True, it is located on the coast but that does not diminish the issues they are having there. The lodges are in between Attawapiskat and Lansdowne House (another native community).  Here is some more info on Attawapiskatt that may interest y'all.  http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/storm_watch_stories3&stormfile=attawapiskat_residents_recei_011211?ref=ccbox_weather_topstories"
644879,Gerritt,2011-12-02 16:45:00,6129,Here is a video of the situation faced by First Nations people in Attawapiskat...... So leaves me to wonder... where did all the money go? and shouldnt DeBoers be helping out this community?    http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/charlie-angus/attawapiskat-emergency_b_1104370.html#undefined    G.
644880,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-02 16:51:00,0,"There is a detailed analysis of ""where"" the money went posted online for all to see.  Let's put it this way... The government spent more on gazebos for the g20 than it has on housing in attawapiskat in the last 5 years.  In my eyes it is nothing less than criminal that there will be children sleeping in a tent tonight, and there's NO argument from the conservatives that will justify that."
644881,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-02 16:55:00,0,"at christmas time we are often shown shocking videos of 3rd world children, who because of circumstances beyond their control are lucky if they have a meal at christmas, let alone all of the decadent presents we will be sharing with our families. at this point it is no shock that we have people living in 3rd world conditions right in our own country and there's no excuse for that."
644882,kickingfrog,2011-12-02 17:06:00,8333,No intention to minimize the situation. As someone who was near the area this September it was a misunderstanding I had myself.
644885,manitoubass2,2011-12-02 17:21:00,11391,"Thanks for the read. I myself have been quite interested in this topic, and have been watching it develop.  Dr. Sal, I agree with the points you made.  I am a little dissappointed in how many seem to think this 90 million figure is just money handed to them (the reservations) to do whatever they so choose with it. Very ignorant statements being thrown around by alot of people, unfortunately. A lot of racial issues being brought up as well.  But with all the bull  set aside, very sad to see HUMANS suffering like this, in our country, or elsewhere.  And we wonder why people grow up with serious issues, mentally, physically etc. If they even survive to be adults  Sad..."
644890,bushart,2011-12-02 17:38:00,2628,Couple things.....  Dr Sal did hit that nail several times.  Last night I watched John Duncan---minister for Indian affairs say to the world that Charlie Angus NDP for attawapiskat region should have brought this up sooner  This is a crock-----I personally watched Angus bring up the Attawapiskat issues on numerous occasions for the last couple YEARS in question period.  I lived on Northern reserves back in the late 70's early 80's working for the Hudson's Bay Co.  One being Black Lake< Sask. up near Uranium city----one thing I recall is the town maintenance worker coming and dumping javex bleach into the town's drinking water to purify it---ta da---guess we're good  This is not a new story and emotions run high on both sides----education and understanding is what is needed.  That's bout as nice as I can say this.
644891,tb4me,2011-12-02 17:43:00,3295,"I have been watching this very closely too. I say a BIG thank-you to the Canadian Red Cross for airing the goverments dirty laundry, and bringing to light the situation at hand. It sickens me to think this is in Canada. There is no excuse for these living conditions. Does anyone know how much longer untill the ice road is passable to get supplies in there?"
644894,ehg,2011-12-02 17:52:00,2666," Great reply Dr. Sal. With the riches plundered from area their is no excuse not to share. It is further 'corporatism' without care.   Yup, further Bull, racism and pillaging so the rich get richer and the original people suffer still 300 yrs. later.    Thanks for sharing your experience Bushart.  Keep those paintings in flow..."
644896,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-02 18:03:00,0,"i should add that despite criticizing the federal cons over the matter,  the systemic failure plaguing our northern areas have long been propogated by members of all political stripes.  this is not a partisan issue and i don't want it to be any longer. it's time mp angus and minister duncan cease the political posturing and accomplish immediate and long term action plans.  i don't claim to know the solutions, but i demand more of my political leaders than to turn a humanitarian crisis into partisan politics.  the cons need to step up to the plate, defy their image, and be the party that sets in motion legitimate change for first nations peoples in the north and elsewhere.  the lefties need to stop throwing around petty insults like ""racist"" and ""colonial"".  every knows the dark history our country has with first nations leading up to this point, but extreme opinions on both sides are standing in the way of a people who don't care who delivers it, they just need help."
644904,bushart,2011-12-02 18:29:00,2628,Like I said Doc---this is not a new story---it has happened under a lot of watches  BTW don't look up levels of 1st Nation incarceration----it'll ruin the weekend
644905,ehg,2011-12-02 18:34:00,2666, Fully in agreement with you. It goes beyond political views this is a HUMAN problem that somehow exists in what is seen as the greatest and fairest country of the world. By remaining indifferent followed by silence is the greatest sin.  ehg
644907,bushart,2011-12-02 18:37:00,2628,Well your communicating an important issue EHG that many times flies under the radar---but hey the nightly news will ensure I know when some hollywood couple splits.
644917,COUNTRYBOY,2011-12-02 19:18:00,130,"shame on our goverment, all that money and for what...3rd world living conditions"
644921,Headhunter,2011-12-02 19:28:00,5703,"I find myself agreeing with most here... and do let it be known that I do not have any first hand experience with this or any other similar situation, I'm just a regular Joe, who goes to work, pays his taxes and tries to do good by my family and friends... but one line in this comment has me yet again shaking my head...  ""Yup, further Bull, racism and pillaging so the rich get richer and the original people suffer still 300 yrs. later.""  Three hundred years later and we are still dealing with ths same nonsense... it would seem that we could probably stay the course for another three hundred years and what will change? Where's the ""win""?! I simply don't get it! Is money the answer? Has that proven to be the solution in other similar situations? It's all fine and dandy for us to point fingers, but wouldn't a viable solution that everyone can ""live"" with be a better option than 300 more years of this! I wish I had that answer! HH"
644922,bushart,2011-12-02 19:31:00,2628,Trust me---both sides would like change
644926,kickingfrog,2011-12-02 19:37:00,8333,Ultimately the fingers should be pointed at us.
644927,bushart,2011-12-02 19:45:00,2628,One of the issues is ----your trying to change and adapt a culture in just over a century that lived that lifestyle since the dawn of time----not an easy task   gets harder and more confusing as well now when technological change reaches those once remote areas and the young people attempt to imitate what is beamed across the airwaves.  Ongoing also is the lands promised under treaty which were once too remote to mean anything---suddenly have resource value----ooopps  So in a nutshell-----no easy answers.
644930,bushart,2011-12-02 19:53:00,2628,Maybe I should also mention...  My step father was a Delaware band member from outside Chatham  I used to spend lots of time fishin on the Grand River in 6 Nations as a kid  And of course my time on the reserves in the north  My good friend is currently Chief of the Wabaskang band council at Ear Falls  My daughter studies these issues at Ottawa University  soooo----I probably have a pretty good reason to be interested---still not easy to answer though
644933,ehg,2011-12-02 19:58:00,2666,"  Hey Joe,  Little unsure of your intention...I was just thinking that part of this situation is rooted in further perpetuation of old colonial habits or attitudes. I could be wrong though.  Am without knowledge and experience as well. Wanted to draw attention to an overlooked Canadian perplexity here in a place that is quite familiar to many on this board.  Cheers..."
