There is already 1 hut out in the narrows with reports of 6"" of solid ice. My brother in law caught 7 pike and 1 perch on his 1st outing yesterday afternoon. His buddy caught a few keeper walleye the night before.      As of today Lake Nipissing has about 500' of ice (wind blown but solid) along the city shore and the marina is once again frozen over."
