On this day Fidel and I both got skunked so we cracked a few brews, took the pressure off and made the best of a slow day.     The release (I was laughing my butt off)      Private property that I had to depart on a solo mission. I was at least warned respectfully...but man that water was nice!    Finally, some fish.  Highdrifter landing a nice buck I got a while back.    And good number of Browns around this fall.      Lakers count too right?     All fish were released. Laszlo"
