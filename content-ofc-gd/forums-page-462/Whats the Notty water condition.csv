647091,J-M,2011-12-10 19:22:00,65,"Was at the notty this morning (near Angus), couldn't believe how high the water is! Still up about a foot and a half and running fast. Its starting to clear but still a bit too high. Confidence was low considering the cold morning we had as well...  Water is up about 2ft at highway 90. No fishermen in sight..  Hope this helps.."
647097,misfish,2011-12-10 19:58:00,29133,"Thanks  I had diffent water then you.High abit but decent vis.4 fish for my efforts this morning.Nothing big avg 3 pounds. Im numb from the cold.  Sunday should be a wee bit better,and warmer I hope."
647143,J-M,2011-12-10 23:39:00,65, Well done! That's a great day out. Good on ya considering the tougher than average water conditions. Did you fish the afternoon bite? Most of my fish have been in the same size range...
