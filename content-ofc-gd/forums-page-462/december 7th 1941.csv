646231,tb4me,2011-12-07 19:17:00,3295,Nice job on the Blog Craig. Way to remember the details. Imagine if they would have sent that 3rd wave of attack that day..Thanks for the reminder and sharing..

Anti aircraft batteries at that time early in the war were more of an afterthought than a real defensive force (besides, try hitting a moving target going at 300mph). Huge tactical error that shortened the war in a big way, all of the battleships (besides the Arizona) were refloated and refitted and saw action in the war. Had they searched for and sank the 2 carrier groups and left the battleships alone would have been far more successful. It was a watershed moment for the world and galvanized the US people into accepting the idea of going to war again which up until that point, they considered it a European problem."
