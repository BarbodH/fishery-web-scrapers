Looking forward to years of fun and companionship from him.  One blue eye and one brownish green.    Whew...luckily I installed that fire hydrant in the yard!! LOL  Thanks for all the name ideas.........it came down to Hank and Ozzy. My youngest boy made the choice since my oldest boy named my late dog Domi 14yrs ago. Only fair I thought.  Colin"

646438,ckrb2007,2011-12-08 14:21:00,449, LOL..I like it too! I got that hydrant from Base Borden in Angus about 10 yrs ago from the water/sewer crew. They were going around replacing all the older ones and I was making sure they didn't dig up our fibre optic cables so they offered it to me. I also got one for my dad as well.
646439,ckrb2007,2011-12-08 14:28:00,449, Here's a pictures of Ozzy's dad. I think there's a resemblance.

646721,limeyangler,2011-12-09 11:03:00,5204,Wow what a beautiful pup!  I had never heard of a 'Victorian Bulldog' before...but googled it.  Apparently a cross between 4 breeds.  I know that one of the breeds was a Staffordshire Bull Terrier....my absolute all time favourite dog......   Thanks for posting...what a great addition to the family.
