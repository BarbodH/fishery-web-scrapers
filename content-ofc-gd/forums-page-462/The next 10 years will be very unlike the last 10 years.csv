646999,dhickey,2011-12-10 04:02:00,1038,"Its human nature to addapt and overcome adversity. That is why we are here today dealing with the choices that need to be made to ensure survival and progress on a world wide basis.  This is why we have the right to vote/freedom that people sacrifice for.  To say that the world economies are doomed without oil or any other fosil fule is foolish.  We are only in the infancey of exploring energy sources ie. wind/solar/geothermal along with all other technolagy that is linked to it. such as zeoro riesistant wier.hydrophonics(food)bio technolagy.  So my piont is forget about the science of yesterday and focus on tomorow.  If we didnt make the jump from sticks and stones as cave people than oil or wind discussions wouldnt happen.  But they are because the future is bright.   ""Happyness is the best revenge""  So keep looking forward...   Great video."
647011,Tybo,2011-12-10 05:12:00,1373,"Telling me the problem without a solution is stupid. If thier is no solution, Is their really a problem.  For Any way you look at it."
647013,dhickey,2011-12-10 06:05:00,1038, The problem does exist and recognition of a problem is the first step to fixing the problem that exist??  So therfore why not be a part of the solution instaed of looking to others for a solution?  The world economy has about 100-125 yrs of fosil fule left .  Thats a credit to our ability to overcome adversity..?  We made the jump from sticks and stones in 60yrs .  100yrs is a tribute to the ability of the humman race for the intelegence erned and what is to be gained..?  Be a part of the solution not a sideliner.
647018,Tybo,2011-12-10 07:08:00,1373,"Salty I Don't know what  the solution will be. But I know when it will happen. When the rich can make a ton of money from use meager peasants.Or our tax dollar pays for it,Then rich buy it and charges use a insane amount."
