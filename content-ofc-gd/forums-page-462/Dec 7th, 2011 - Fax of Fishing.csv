We tried at least 20 different lures (big, small, high and low)  The results of efforts were    No Strikes and of course No Fish.   The water was very dirty with lots of floating dead weeds that ended up in the swivels at the lures. There was a large amount of run-off water entering the bay from all the creeks and ditches - that's the only thing (other than pressure change) that turned off the fish.  Other boats near us weren't having a great day also, we saw one net over the side very early and never again.  Hoping to get out again before Xmas  David  aka  Superdad"

They were all extremely sluggish.  We fished HARD and tried many different approaches from just after light until an hour after dark.  Yesterday was truly one of those times when it just wasn't on."
