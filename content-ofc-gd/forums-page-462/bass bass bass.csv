645951,mercman,2011-12-06 21:25:00,7054,  I love it !!!
645954,walleyemaster,2011-12-06 21:35:00,325," somebody here understands what im saying and a few others too. i have a 3 acre pond stocked with bass, and yes there are monsters in there, and yes to all of you who fish them black shoelace or even white shoelace then again pink shoelace works too. i fish many lakes with huge bass huntsville area for one simcoe area for two kawartha areas for three.. do i really need to go on...."
645955,kuhaman,2011-12-06 21:38:00,503,"I wish I had a pond, I would stock it full of walleye and pickeral"
646055,walleyemaster,2011-12-07 03:16:00,325, bass bass bass bass bass fisherman can kiss my bass...lol
646336,RobbieTheM,2011-12-08 00:58:00,35,  Canadian and American fish in the same pond?????
646343,Rizzo,2011-12-08 01:18:00,4754," ...ya, gotta hate it when that happens. Dang pesky muskies"
646361,SirWhite,2011-12-08 02:38:00,210,That's a pretty dumb statement OP
646440,Dave Bailey,2011-12-08 14:30:00,1641,"Those who only target walleye will never experience the greatest thrill in fishing - watching and feeling the smash of a topwater strike. Walleye may be tastier, trout may take skill, but seeing that very visible indication of the upcoming fight is a massive rush."
646476,mike rousseau,2011-12-08 17:18:00,4661,  I can see walleye coming for my lure when fishing from shore at night... Just keep the headlight on low you can see your lure and the fish eyes...  Even got a walleye on a figure 8 one time doing this...
646477,manitoubass2,2011-12-08 17:25:00,11391,"Yeppers MM  I've had then hit topwater frogs as well, when they push the shorelines"
646479,Harrison,2011-12-08 17:32:00,2202,Pound for pound nothing fights better then a smallmouth fisherman.
646480,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-12-08 17:35:00,535,  The water there is also crystal clear too which helps. Many lakes/rivers I fish have maybe 2-5' of visability. One of my favourite days of fishing was using a husky jerk this summer and seeing bass come out of nowhere to smash it.  Bass can be very fun to catch....when you're targetting them lol. It's definetely more exciting using lures to catch bass than live bait even though it's more difficult.
646486,manitoubass2,2011-12-08 17:49:00,11391,"What other fish would hit an xrap going backwards???  ok, pike I suppose"
646492,mike rousseau,2011-12-08 18:10:00,4661,  I had a musky nail a Topraider that was tangled and coming in backwards... Missed it... Recast... Caught it...
646494,manitoubass2,2011-12-08 18:18:00,11391," Right on!!!  I have one spot that I fish from shore, where it's heavy current heading west, just on the inside of an eddie. In the spring, I have caught smallies casting south, and letting the current pull it west and towards shore. I loosen up the drag and let the lure head west.  So at one point, the lure is going backwards for abit, and this is where the strikes come. Almost no action on the lure at all. and I've caught a ton off bass doing this."
646539,stasbrute,2011-12-08 22:05:00,206,"Bass fun, Walleye food......"

646658,Dave Bailey,2011-12-09 02:50:00,1641, Isn't that illegal? 
646686,msp,2011-12-09 03:58:00,1336,Since we are on the topic of easy fish to catch. Lets talk about a fish that returns to to same river every year. If thats not easy pickins I dont know what is.
646687,mike rousseau,2011-12-09 03:59:00,4661,  Read the quote...  I am not attracting fish with my light... Just seeing the eyes glowing behind my lure...
645781,walleyemaster,2011-12-06 03:51:00,325,"hi guys  was just looking at pictures the other day from the fishing album and i think i have only 1 picture of a bass in it.  its not because i have'nt caught many i've caught bass and big bass smallies the size of footballs.., its mostly because i hate catching bass. they are the easiest fish to catch, i sometimes for fun and to get a laugh i use a black shoelace and a hook and catch bass. oh whats that?? pound for pound they are the toughest fight, maybe but maybe not, i have tangled with some speckle trout that have pound for pound out produced a bass fight.. ive caught so many bass and big bass that it almost pissis me off when i get one on my line, especially when im targeting other fish..there so aggresive that you dont even have know how to fish in my opinion.. when i bring new people fishing , i bring them for bass so they catch a fish and have fun, i guess in this case bass are all not that bad, but they sure are easy.."
645782,manitoubass2,2011-12-06 03:59:00,11391,"start fishing bass tournys for the ""easy"" money, seems like the next logical step"
645783,Live2fish85,2011-12-06 04:04:00,1633,They fight better then walleye haha.
645785,walleyemaster,2011-12-06 04:10:00,325,"yes they do fight better then walleye, but easier to catch, thats all i was saying. if i entered a tournament i would probably never catch any bass, i have just found that almost everytime i go fishing does not matter what lake. i catch a bass..its a great starter fish for kids. but as you get older you want a challange, bass was the first fish i caught in a small lake and i was hooked with fishing, now its a challenge that i look for, bass = no challange"
645792,sauce,2011-12-06 05:02:00,219,Sounds to me like you are tryin to stir the pot. Great way to single yourself out. Lots of people like fishin for bass. I sure do. Good luck with mastering walleye. Hopefully you never catch another bass.
645793,Live2fish85,2011-12-06 05:20:00,1633,"I was just joking around. I like walleye to and they are a bit harder to catch, depending on where your fishing. After musky fishing I already can tell there will be alot less bass fishing for me."
645794,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-12-06 06:06:00,535,"I can get what you're saying but bass is very popular for a reason. They're very aggressive, abundant and put up a nice fight (especially smallmouths). It's also fairly inexpensive to do (well, it CAN be inexpensive), so it appeals to more people. You can buy a cheap rod & reel, grab some worms and fish off shore for LG in almost any lake, or you can be a pro in a VERY competitive tournament, or anything in between.   Since I got into musky fishing I've almost stopped fishing for bass because I wanted to try for something bigger and more difficult to catch, plus I fished for bass exclusively all my life, I wanted to try something new."
645806,singingdog,2011-12-06 11:57:00,1047,"Like he said, if you are so good at catching huge bass, go make yourself a million on the bass circuit.  Personally, I don't get the draw of walleye fishing. I have hooked 24"" eyes that have all the fight of an 8"" bass. There's a reason that some folks call them ""boots""; but they are tasty"
645807,mercman,2011-12-06 12:01:00,7054,"I am a bass fisher from way back,but i have recently switched to Walleye as my main target species,simply because they are more plentiful where i fish.They taste good though"
645809,MCTFisher9120,2011-12-06 12:05:00,3761,"Are you talking about bass or dinks my friend? Yes bas can be easy to catch...small bait live bait some days you cant keep small bass off but I never can have a day where every bass is over 3 lbs and big...To say they are the easiest to catch thats because small bass are readily available.  When I tye on a flippin jig or a scum frog and go ""bass fishing"" I'm not finding it easy...a half dozen morning bites is all I get sometimes and those are not small ""bass"" but quality fish.  Like you walleye fishing is easy....I have never caught a hundred bass in 2hrs ten ft away from my boat...but the almighty walleye please there is one lure u need and thats a jig and grub...real hard to catch"
645812,BassMan11,2011-12-06 12:30:00,583,Well take the live bait off your jig head then. And don't you think a shoelace might look like a leech. Throw some top water lures on. You can't tell me that is boring.
645814,Rizzo,2011-12-06 13:03:00,4754,"you want easy to catch and boring? try catching a hammerhandle pike. If I'm not catching a musky, I'll take a smallmouth any day of the week"
645819,Rod Caster,2011-12-06 13:20:00,5784,Haha strike a match and light the fuse. You know what is really easy? Getting bass guys going.  OhFN.
645823,Harrison,2011-12-06 13:37:00,2202,I was going to have fun and debate.  Then I remembered my number #1 rule.  Do not debate with someone who clearly hates capitals.
645831,lhousesoccer,2011-12-06 13:48:00,442,This guy should be KVD's next Classic competitor .... shouldn't be difficult at all for this guy to beat him.

645855,jimmer,2011-12-06 14:45:00,2730,Can you tell me your secret for catching fall bass in the Kawarthas?
645856,Remastered,2011-12-06 14:47:00,143,Show us tourny results. THEN I might just be impressed.
645867,DoubleDigits,2011-12-06 15:08:00,140,Any tips for a Simcoe 6 lber in November? Shoelace maybe???
645873,shane,2011-12-06 15:16:00,652,Shoelace??!!  Isn't that like flossing?
645921,kuhaman,2011-12-06 18:26:00,503,You can floss with a shoelace? Better see a dentist  I am a walleye fanatic but as long as somethings tugging on my line I'm happy
645932,adolson,2011-12-06 19:17:00,783,"OP, I feel the same way about pike. I don't enjoy eating pike.. I have, but it's so hit-or-miss. And I will handle them, but I need a chemical rinse afterwards. Here's a picture of me catching my last pike of the season, when I was actually targeting bass:    Same for me, but trout instead of musky. I am not giving up on bass entirely, but definitely spending more time going for specks and friends. (I am neither equipped nor in the correct part of the province to take up musky hunting. Some day I will give it a shot, though! (And hope it doesn't ruin trout for me.))  Yeah, I used to be one...  Then you showed me that walleye fishing can be not boring by pulling them in hand-over-fist."
645933,kuhaman,2011-12-06 19:25:00,503,"Dana, you gotta try pike the way I cook it. I bet you would change your mind"
645934,motion,2011-12-06 19:29:00,403,So many bass but NO pictures. Interesting...............
645937,mike rousseau,2011-12-06 19:37:00,4661,i personally dont like bass very much...  but they are nice for people in my boat that dont fish much... keeps em entertained between walleye...  for me when im targeting one species... any other species is anoying...  even a musky... i always think i have a giant eye on the hook... only to find out its another musky...   i do think in general... bass are easier to catch then most other popular sportfish... but it is very difficult to consistantly catch larger then average bass... i almost never target bass... and even i know how or where to get a couple all yeaer... even right now... i could go get some smallies tomorrow... not quality ones... but bass
