Anyone see it....sometimes History Channel for some reason delays the broadcast up north....don't understand why.  Bob"

646462,Billy Bob,2011-12-08 15:40:00,5865, Never heard of this one....or are you just making this crap up....

Its pretty funny to watch, and even scarey to think about  "

On the positive side, the producers have really good facial hair consultants - the characters really look the part of rough tough prospectors, complete with stern faces and crossed arms. The rest of it is horse pucky - trying to place 'the Klondike' as part of the USA - it is in Yukon, Canada. And they know next to nothing of placer mining.  Horrible damage to the environment - Tore up the equavalent of a few football fields with a bull dozer to find that the area had already been mined -idiots."
