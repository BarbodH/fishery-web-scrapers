647048,beertech,2011-12-10 15:28:00,118,Need imput here on new fishfinder purchase. I have two boat one a tinner at cottage and one for lake erie and ontario. I want a fishfinder with sideimaging that i can buy an extra transducer and swap between boats. The new lowrance looks great but not sure about the ability to swap it with the down imaging box. Humminbird is built in but not sure of the speed quality compared to lowrance. any imput would be greatly appreciated. Oh and will the structure scan allow me to follow weedlined.

Swapping them back and forth is a pain in the    and can be hard on the unit's plugs, etc....  I have seen Lowrance just came out with their 2nd Generation HDS units so their 1st Generation HDS units are on sale at most store that carry them...or check online, even check Ebay.  Bob"
