646681,Ben_Daniels,2011-12-09 03:48:00,435,I just recently found out what OP is... but what's ModQ?
646693,ccmtcanada,2011-12-09 04:02:00,7971, Modq is where a post by a watched user isn't posted right away.  A 'mod'erator has to approve it before its visible on the forum.  It sits in a line or queue to be approved is a way to look at it...that a mod approves.....hence modq
646697,GBW,2011-12-09 04:06:00,8460,can ya tell us in stupid terms?  I know there are users out there who still don't get it....  LOL!

646707,blaque,2011-12-09 04:31:00,2419,"I've got no issues with mods editing or deleting posts. Their house , their rules. I think it's happened to a post or two of mine and it confused me at first as i didnt know i could be edited lol. But i never gave it a second thought once I realized what happened. The instances this has happened, it was obvious why and I had no questions. If memory serves me, I used a word that was a little too colorful. It was changed and I said to myself.....""ok don't use that particular word again"", message received."
646708,dhickey,2011-12-09 04:44:00,1038,IMO I think it might be time for all involved in OFC/OFC to take a side step. ALL of us have this big red button engrained within our personality that is hard to controll for what ever reason? This red button can be pushed by any one at any time for any reason with seamingly no explination. As an OFC member when you go to your favorates bar and hit OFC You are commited to conducting your self in a way that is acceptable on a public forum. Having said that. Moderators are absolutly justified in thier attempts to stay true to the spirit of the forum they choose to moderate?  This comming from somebody that has been eddited several times and  put on the( Modd Q list once) within my first year..  All it takes is sombody having a bad day or week and BOOM YOU SAID SOMTHING OUT OF CHARACTER OR CONTEXT. Modds generaly keep that sort of reply on the down low(auwsum)...   Thanks man.   OFC/OFC    I LIKE IT  I LIKE IT ALLOT!!!!!   Ps.  No spellcheck
646716,Ben_Daniels,2011-12-09 06:08:00,435," Thanks for clearing that up Cliff! It definitely makes sense for Mod's to preview certain peoples posts that have a bad history. Changing peoples posts/wording(editing), if I understand some of the complaints correctly, is another story. It's completely alright by me to delete a person's post, but its not OK to change their post or wording... I hate anyone being censored, but deleting posts probably keeps a lot of crap off here. Having said all this, OFC is a privately owned Internet Message-Board, it's the Owners/Mod's board and therefore its their rules, even if they aren't right. (Most of the time I find them reasonable and easy to get along with, once you understand how the board works).  I've probably been put on ModQ at least once lol, a couple years ago I remember getting a couple messages from different Mod's telling me a certain post I made was offside and that multiple Mod's had raised my warning level and that they had to lower the warnings because too many Mod's warned me in such a short perios, after looking at my post I realized that it was a bad comment. There's a lot of cool people and great info on here once you get over some of the quirks of the members"

646746,chuckymcd,2011-12-09 13:43:00,144,"This thread was very entertaining to read! Good points made on both sides.  However, there is still lots of water out there still, so lets not argue and get out and fish."
646766,TJQ,2011-12-09 14:41:00,7806,"I'll weigh in here just a bit.. and reiterate (sorry.. it is the only word I could think of..) Arts comments are right on the nose. First off. Contrary to popular belief, were not making any significant money off this forum. We've tried over the years, we got rid of banners and advertising, cause people either never paid their bills or by having a banner, they thought they had even more right to spam us or want special treatment. After having to be moved to a dedicated server what little we make monthly off the Google ads pays the bills. That's it.. no big mystery.  Secondly, the mods do have lives and jobs and family's, some of us have businesses, some of us have day jobs, some of us have to go away for weeks at a time for work, and occasionally some of us have health issues which prevents us from being online to babysit all day long. So when a post gets removed or edited, you have to remember the fact that you just took time out of a moderators day.. his NON PAID time to edit something you said that you likely already knew was close to or was crossing a line. So if the mod is gruff, or DOESN'T SPEND MORE TIME to write you a nice little note explaining to you why your an idiot (hopefully in small words so the user can understand) you'll have to forgive us. Most of the mods here have been doing this for yes... 10 years, and although I stay out of the mod business. (I have received veiled death threats regarding MY family from users... I'm not kidding..) I am amazed at the jobs the boys do. This place wouldn't be here without them. If you had see ALL of the stupid crap that people do here.. over time you just wouldn't believe it. So bottom line is.. and here is a metaphor you can use.. If you drop a cigarette butt in our house and we pick it up without telling you, it doesn't give you the right to do it again, just because we didn't tell you we picked it up. You should have known better in the first place.  10 years.... members come and members go. Its just the way it is."

646641,Dutch,2011-12-09 02:15:00,831,"I tend to agree with the OP on this one.  If someone breaks the rules and their post is edited or deleted they need to know why, so they don't repeat the bahaviour.  I belong to another much larger board with the same number of mods/admins and my posts have been edited in the past there.  I always receive a PM from the mod that made the change and at least a copy of the rule I broke - guess what, I understood why and I don't repeat the same behaviour.  It's like training a dog or dealing with a child - no feedback, no change.  Mods would have an easier job if they told people why they got edited, that would lead to less people making the mistake in the first place on future posts.  If there are repeat offenders - put them on modQ and if that doesn't work, lower the ban hammer."

646652,Dutch,2011-12-09 02:38:00,831," I don't think there needs to be any notification that the post was edited, like a before and after.  What I've seen is the post will be edited, like it normally would, but a mod PM's the offender and puts ""your post in the following topic was modified due to rule #X""  If the poster has any issues with it, they can PM the mod back for explanation.  Ususally though it is very apparent from the quoted rule what the infraction was.  Obviously it is against the rules to start topics quetioning why a post was modified and those posts are deleted without explanation.  After 3-5 of these, put 'em on modQ."

646665,aplumma,2011-12-09 03:05:00,6896,Just to add a view here but the rules are very plain and their are no big words used in it's writing. If your post is edited/deleted or moved it is because you have broken a rule. The time to read this board daily mind you not just the ones we like is very time consuming. Now add in a full time job plus family and other obligations we run out of time. To then include sending notes to tell people they are breaking a rule just isn't possible. We all as moderators are here for the love of the site. We are not here for glory or monitory compensation it is simply a place we have come to value as a place for friends to meet. If you are here to find friends and share your good and bad spots in life in a manner that is inside the rules WELCOME. If you are here to express your world outside of the rules then your stay will be short. OFC is not about how many hits we get or how many members we have those are important only to sites that are for profit. We have members here who will give you the shirt off their back go outside of the rules and they get adjusted just like the people with 10 posts. I personally have edited posts countless times for mock cussing and after the person sees the @$&/ disappear from their posts do they really need me to send them a note?  We are a board that has both young and old here reading if you can not express your point without breaking our simple rules then we will help you by editing it. This is my opinion to this rant.  Art
646560,Guest chase4chrome,2011-12-08 23:02:00,0,"Now that the topic of rants has been broached I thought to post mine--admittedly on pain of further removal, elision, corrective ad nauseam.  Now I don't mind people expressing their opinions here--the very nature of this ""forum"" requires such exchange for its very vitality. Indeed, rants, off-colour jokes, verbal sparring, and even, as has elsewhere been noted ""pissing in cornflakes"" are all what makes for an informative, educational, and entertaining virtual AGORA.  It has elsewhere been said also ""I thy eye offend thee, then pluck it out...""  I also acknowledge that for such a site to continue to excel and be a rallying space for like-minded sportsmen an organising principle and concomitant formulation of decorum must also exist.  That having been said, and that is how far I am willing to extend my deference,... -IF a post is reported to have transgressed some rule or other then I think incumbent to alert the OP -IF as the result of such a report someone deigns to EDIT the OP's post then I should think that, again, the OP should first be alerted and be given the opportunity to make changes that are more sensitive to our broader readership. -IF the report continues to offend with no action on the part of the OP then I would agree that ADMIN action ought to be taken  It should be noted that I have received NO such notification, request, alert YET my post has been unilaterally edited several times (though I don't know be whom and am accusing no one in particular......""just sayin""). It is not the particular right of the person speaking that is curtailed, on the contrary it is your right to hear it.    Thanks for your considerations ladies and gentlemen"
646566,kemper,2011-12-08 23:29:00,2232,"If the mods had to go through that process every time something came up that needed to be edited TJ would need to hire 500 more.

There may have been others edited that I didn't notice but not that I'm aware of, I guess if I post something offencive to someone, the powers that be feel it is better to just remove it. Their site, their rules and I know that if I don't like it I can take my toys and go home."
646574,Terry,2011-12-08 23:44:00,14456,"post disappear and words get change..I think there is a big wheel like wheel of fortune..wing ding ding ding ..it landed on the word... but.......delete all post with the word ""but"" in it  ..well anyways as most are noticing it has got to the point of being stupid..."

646576,Bill Shearer,2011-12-08 23:45:00,456,"I remember the words of a fellow employee, after I whined about a management decision, in a place where I worked for thirty years. If you don't like it, quit! We are non-paying guests here, that are sometimes able to offer our opinions, subject to censoring without justification or prior notice. Just my opinion, FWIW"
646577,Guest chase4chrome,2011-12-08 23:46:00,0, Not too seriously at all Kemp--just acknowledging your platform and contribution
646579,Terry,2011-12-08 23:49:00,14456, and many are leaving or post less  but the members are this forum not the mods  the members go and what have you got..a few people q-moding each other
646581,danbouck,2011-12-08 23:54:00,4380,I think that the mods are doing just fine and shouldn't change anything.  EDIT: Maybe bring more Vitamin water XXX to Lakair!

646583,Big Cliff,2011-12-08 23:55:00,6899, Well said!
646584,Guest chase4chrome,2011-12-08 23:56:00,0,"   I see no problem with having the transgression explained--and true enough I can take my toys and go home too, but there is a larger principle at stake (it's just in my nature  )"
646585,Guest chase4chrome,2011-12-08 23:57:00,0,   AGREED

646588,Gerritt,2011-12-08 23:59:00,6129,"WoW.... you really do not ""mesh"" well here at all I have seen it in all manners of you're posts here...   I will not pull out my thesaurus and do battle with you're thesaurus.... to do so would be futile and waste Googles massive resources...  the simple matter of the truth is if you are having a difficult time here on OFC, it is usually because you.. yes yourself known as oneself (noun) is the issue... You seem to go against the grain.. much like when you were a wee lad in grade school... being picked after the girls to be on a team no one cares about... Yes.. we care that much if you stay or go.  this is a community... and as such we have those that choose to part of it which means compromise... those that think they are above the collective community.. and those that are obviously below it...  you choose where you belong... but trust me... leave you're Thesaurus at home... as it will not score you any points here...  Now... should I run this post through Google to make myself even more obtuse? or do you get the drift?..  Follow the rules we all observe as a community... or choose to be alienated from it... the choice is yours...  G."

646591,mercman,2011-12-09 00:01:00,7054,"I dont know what to make of it sometimes Perhaps its an effort to reduce the chance of elevateing heated discussions. Perhaps its an effort to maintain civility in the tone of certain threads Who knows I do feel that lately, the forum is over moderated, but i guess thats an effort to control the winternet phenomena. They just have to realize, that we are not children,and shouldnt be treated like one."
