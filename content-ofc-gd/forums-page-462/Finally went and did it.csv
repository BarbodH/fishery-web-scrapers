647064,Beans,2011-12-10 17:13:00,3339," I drove by twice on Thursday...First time I was in heavy traffic and missed the address and second time looking for 117 I got to 125 before I found an address...  Oh well, you will be there for many years...   "
647076,Sinker,2011-12-10 18:13:00,8692,"  Hey  Beans, he's just east of Emms, on the south side. Can't miss the big sign that says ""the shop"".  I've already booked my next appt  Tires are great Ernie!  S."
644908,Beans,2011-12-02 18:39:00,3339, My guess it was the two bait and tackle stores just down the street...  Congrats on the move Ernie and I hope all goes well for you...   
644910,fishnsled,2011-12-02 18:53:00,3520,Congrats Ernie!! All the best with the new business.
644913,ricoboxing,2011-12-02 19:03:00,398,"yes you are right, but I just want to make sure I go at it properly so I'm not in over my head. The fact that I still have a young family means that I have so much more to lose if I fail. The restaurant business has one of the highest failure rates! I want to crawl really good before I try to stand up and run!"
644934,Skipper D,2011-12-02 19:58:00,1970,"  That sounds like me twenty five years ago ....lol , ""if i fail"" . Back in my mid 30's i had an idea and ran it by a local buisness guy i worked for and he told me to go for it and i said to him my great'ess fear was what if i failed , then he told me i was cheatting my self thinking that way and asked me if i would feel better knowing i tryed and failed then never  having tryed at all . I left him and pondered what he said for a few days til it made sence , why cheat my self , i was a hard worker , nobody ever had to tell me what to do , i made the companies i worked for lots of money , then thought what if i worked that hard for my self , i could'nt go wrong , so i dove in with both feet , walked in and asked for a fifty thousand dollar loan and the stupid buggers gave it to me and i went out and bought my first peice equipment , then went home and said to my self what ta hell did i just go and do , scared to death . Now my friend 25 years later i have assets worth over 1.2 and i am just getting started at knowing what i am doing and loving it more and more each day and what i can achive . But thru it all i forgot one thing , i forgot to add in ones health and the old age that was coming . At 48 i got sick with  heart trouble , the kind they can't fix , i am know 56 and i am tired like an old man and with no medication i'd be gone in a few days and i am still putting my employees to bed every day . My only regreet is that i did'nt get off my ass sooner , if i had off i could of had all i wanted by the time i reached 40 , you know they say it all starts after 40 where you health is consern , just ask any of the older one's here . Don't wait to long my friend if you think you have what it takes ."
644936,jimmer,2011-12-02 20:07:00,2730,Congratulations! I will have to check you out the next time I can't do my own repair. Honour your work and you should do well. It's a small town and word gets around fast if people aren't happy.

644946,Miracon,2011-12-02 20:38:00,200,Congrats on your big step! You'll find it very gratifying! I've been self-employed for 17 years now and there will always be pros and cons but I would never have it any other way!  Do you need a website?!!

646663,Bernie,2011-12-09 03:01:00,3190,"Good for you Ernie. The first 5 years are the toughest. Lots of hours toiling to pay for equipment. But the hard work should pay off in the long run.  I started out in our community with a couple things no one else did. Alignments, AC and a lot of experience in ""new fangled stuff""  Worked out real well."
646668,irishfield,2011-12-09 03:10:00,26272,"So what are you saying Bernie... in another 10 years he should be able to go ice fishing again!!  Congrats Ernie... nose to the grind stone and remember there's nobody gonna pat you on the back but yourself for your hard work. It can get lonely, but enjoy the other side of the freedom!"
646731,ecmilley,2011-12-09 12:32:00,2163,"just gat my alignment set up and working wednesday, i am the first one in Canada apparantly with the new john beam laser 3d machine with the double targets 5 mp camera and pro 42 software all I know for sure is it works great. lots of hours for sure but at least there for hours for me still need an AC machine but that can wait till april, again thanks everyone for the support"
646732,Spiel,2011-12-09 12:33:00,9065,Best wishes in your endeavour Ernie.
646734,Big Cliff,2011-12-09 12:39:00,6899, So is it all set up and ready to go? If so I'll be coming in to see you very soon!

644711,ecmilley,2011-12-01 23:44:00,2163,"After 16 years at Active Green+Ross opened my own garage in Lindsay, 12 minute commute from home instead of 2 hours. Been unofficially opened for the last month working on the place, getting things organized and ready, my new laser aligner should  be in Friday and  I am good to go. I can even sled to work now if i desire, I am located on Queen st operating as ""THE SHOP"""
644713,cranks bait,2011-12-01 23:46:00,721,Congratulations!!!  Good luck on your new venture!
644714,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-01 23:46:00,10439,Good stuff!!! Having your own business is pretty satisfying but a ton of work. I had my own for over 10 years and got tired of the 7 day work weeks. Now I work 5 days and don't worry nearly as much.

I bought the company i was working for, 8 years ago, and love it.With good employees, i can still take long weekends all summer, and fish when i want  Just remember, take time for yourself, and when the key goes in the door at night, the work stays there till the next day."

644726,Familyfisherman,2011-12-02 00:24:00,188,"Good move for sure!  More risk, MUCH more reward.  Some work too much -- hire excellent staff -- NEVER settle...that way the work can continue even when you aren't there.  No one ever says on their deathbed they wished they spent more time at work...as MM says, take time for youself.  A happy business owner is a far more effective business owner...of course, too much fishing and you'll need to fish to eat, but you'll find that balance  Well done!"
644739,SlowPoke,2011-12-02 01:15:00,2984,Congratulations Ernie! I grew tired of lining everyone else's pockets for 20+ years and decided to go out on my own this spring. It has been pretty smooth for me and I've relied on great advice and insight from my accountant and others in my field. Enjoy the short commute and best of luck with your new venture. -Brian

Think of how many breakdowns occur 2 minutes after the shop closes!  Best of luck and may it go well!

644819,Harrison,2011-12-02 13:30:00,2202,"All the best my friend!  One little bitty piece of advice.  Get a book keeper, the cost is minimal and it frees you up to do what you do.  I can hook you up if need be."
644821,Skipper D,2011-12-02 13:32:00,1970,"  All the more reason  why you can'nt , are real reasons why you should , they will be what drives you . I started with a wife and two kids in public school and 200 $ from my laid off paycheck . Don't kid your self , if you think you have what it takes , go use it and if all go's well you will ask your self in the end why did'nt i do it sooner . Never wait to long because before you know it there is not enought time left . Good luck ..........Ron"
644831,aplumma,2011-12-02 13:49:00,6896,Glad to hear you are making the plunge. I have been self employed for 18 years now and the best advise I can give you is have a good accountant. Work hard and treat your customers fairly and the word will get around. Don't forget the elderly if one finds you and they are happy they will bring you their friends and they will come to you for everything from a light bulb to an engine from you.   Art
644840,crappieperchhunter,2011-12-02 14:08:00,2582,"  Truer words have not been spoken.  We own some rental property. Our first accountant was a friend of a friend. Saved us money so we where happy. Our current accountant is freaking unbelievable. The money he saves us with his knowledge just blows me away. Find a good accountant and you will benefit big time.  Congrats on the plunge and the best of luck with your ""New baby"""
644866,hirk,2011-12-02 15:36:00,571,Wow awsome Ernie. Nice change for ya. Be nice to your customers and they will be good too you . Best of luck!!
