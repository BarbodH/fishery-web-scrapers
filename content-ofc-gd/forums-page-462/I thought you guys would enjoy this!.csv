646362,RickOnt,2011-12-08 02:40:00,669,Great shot! Very Nice!  Rick
646366,ChrisK,2011-12-08 02:48:00,2772,Very cool Bill !!
646368,Jds63,2011-12-08 03:05:00,1365,great picture ...
646375,Fishnwire,2011-12-08 03:27:00,983,"If I took that photo, I'd probably sell my camera and stop taking pictures.  There's no way I'd ever top it, so why bother?  Amazing...seriously amazing pic."
646907,danc,2011-12-09 21:44:00,4677,Been away for a while and missed this one Bill. Incredible shot Bud!
646912,Joey,2011-12-09 21:54:00,9122,Just incredible Bill.  You should post the whole sequence
646917,BillM,2011-12-09 22:12:00,17367," I used 'One shot' instead of AI Servo for the focus, so instead of re-focusing for each shot, it kept the focal length from the original shot...   I am soooo pissed at myself for doing this, lol.   Anyhow, this is a big crop, some of the other pics after a crop just aren't sharp enough....  I'll have a Canon 100-400 on loan with me next year, so hopefully I'll get some even better shots!"
646939,Joey,2011-12-09 23:52:00,9122," Ah, I hear ya Bill.  Ruined many a shot doing the same thing.  Hopefully the Canon will bring us some nice pictures next year"
646073,BillM,2011-12-07 04:07:00,17367,"I know we have a photo forum but a lot of you guys don't go there    Captured this on a trip up north in August.  Backstory is I caught that brookie about 15mins before, however due to the regulations it was below the slot and I had to let it go..  I tried and tried to revive it (A good 30 mins) but it just wasn't going to work..  However it didn't go to waste as you can see.   I've got the complete sequence from the eagle staring at the fish, circling and coming down and taking it out of the lake!   Just an fyi but that's over a 20inch brookie, lol!!  "
646076,captpierre,2011-12-07 04:41:00,2521,Spectacular photo.  Would have been nice in the frypan with some butter
646078,blaque,2011-12-07 04:43:00,2419,Wow! That is a stunning image. I'm impressed on all counts. Id'a been fumbling for the camera and can almost guarantee I would have muffed the shot lol. Talk about seizing an opportunity!!!
646080,Moosebunk,2011-12-07 04:54:00,3970,"Fish killer!!!  Not the eagle... you Bill.   Great shot.  I know that bird, fish and spot all to well.  Captured perfectly dood!"

646117,Djeep,2011-12-07 12:30:00,199,"amazing pic, you must have quite the camera!"
646118,Skipper D,2011-12-07 12:48:00,1970,"You could'nt ask for a better picture to be taken , amagin if the hook had still been in , some one from a far would have thought you were out flying some new sort of remote ."
646119,Rizzo,2011-12-07 12:57:00,4754,awesome...better a majestic eagle than a stinky ugly snapping turtle
646120,corvette1,2011-12-07 13:06:00,1765,awesome shot bill

646128,Raf,2011-12-07 13:40:00,3495," yep, bald eagle nuggets are delicious.  nice shot bill."

646140,Twocoda,2011-12-07 14:36:00,4130,totally worthy of a double or triple mat frame and wall! excellent capture/release/capture Bill
646141,Pikeslayer,2011-12-07 14:37:00,1443,
646147,ckrb2007,2011-12-07 14:49:00,449,"That is one awesome shot Bill! I wish I had a camera like yours to capture the Osprey I see every morning ""fishing"" while bass fishing in the Kawaratha during the summer!"
646149,MeesterTweester,2011-12-07 15:00:00,2,I wouldn't want to meet that bird in a back alley. Huge.
646161,fishnsled,2011-12-07 15:39:00,3520,Terrific shot Bill!
646185,FishTracker,2011-12-07 16:53:00,47,"Fantastic shot, Bill!  Sharpness, colour....really great!  The way it's framed - using the eagle's wings - naturally force your eye to look at that sweet brookie in the claws!  Great work!"
