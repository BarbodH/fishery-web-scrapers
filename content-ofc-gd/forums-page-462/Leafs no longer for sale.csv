642914,Jds63,2011-11-25 15:04:00,1365,"Personally I didn't want it to fall into foreign ownership , but I guess if the price was right OTPP wouldn't care who they sold it to.  Not sure why Bell and Rogers don't split on the ownership, seems it would be a good fit for both corporations.  http://www.thestar.com/article/1092448--maple-leafs-no-longer-for-sale?bn=1"
642915,tb4me,2011-11-25 15:12:00,3295,"That sale would have never happened. Lawrence ""Larry"" Tanenbaum has first shot at matching any offer for them. He has enough investors to gobble up those shares in a hurry."

643228,bucktail,2011-11-26 15:03:00,1857,Thank god they didnt sell it to someone who wants to win. Isnt that in the bizarro world?

646763,ccmtcanada,2011-12-09 14:38:00,7971,Yep...heard on 680 news that the news conference at 930 this morning is to announce that Bell and Rogers are buying the majority stake in MLSE.
646765,Jds63,2011-12-09 14:41:00,1365," Yeah i had read the news this morning, maybe i could get a commission ... LOL"
646815,kickingfrog,2011-12-09 16:24:00,8333,When does am640 contract for Leafs radio games end?
646866,Rod Caster,2011-12-09 19:37:00,5784,"If Bell and Rogers buy them up, that could be the end of hockey night in canada. Bell and Rogers cause us daily headaches and own pretty much every canadian TV station, radio etc. If either one of those companies goes bankrupt in the future it'll cost taxpayers billions. Not a good idea in my opinion. Those two companies are big enough. Maybe Bell should use that ""investment"" money to fix their insolvency issues they had a couple years back, or god forbid, by making telecommunicatons cheaper in Canada for the people who pay for it. Everything will get more expensive, including ticket prices if this goes ahead. Grrrr to Bell and Rogers! Aren't your bellies fat enough already?"
646871,Kingsalmon,2011-12-09 19:52:00,107,"Me thinks this is going to be bad for the fans.  If you think the Leafs ticket prices are too high to begin with, wait until next year.  I'm sure their economists see that demand is far greater than supply and they are going to crank up the prices even more, and turning HNiC into Hockey Night on Sportsnet or TSN will make them even more money.  Good thing I never was a hockey fan.   I'd rather spend my money fishing!"
646880,tb4me,2011-12-09 20:32:00,3295,ya not a big fan either...This is a BAD deal for the CBC and HNIC..Should be interesting..
646983,NAW,2011-12-10 03:14:00,4022,Done deal by the sounds of it.  Bell and Rogers both part owners of the leafs.  This will be interesting
646984,misfish,2011-12-10 03:18:00,29133,"Get ready to pay,I mean pay,MORE to watch."
