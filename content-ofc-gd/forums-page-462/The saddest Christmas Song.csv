Poverty, illness and personal conflicts are all magnified at Christmas.In the beginning of December last year, i thought i was going to lose my mother, and through some miracle, she bounced back 2 weeks before Christmas, and is with us this Christmas as well. I am lucky, many are not.There are a few members of OFC, who will be spending thier first Christmas without a loved one, and i would like to lend my support top them.I know what you have gone through, and will go through in the coming weeks.Seek strength from thier memories.Include them in your conversations.Respect them with your love. Merry Christmas, and God bless you all.  <iframe width=""480"" height=""360"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/qq_ZSaDHI2M"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"

The cashier scanned the item and told him the total was S2.25 (including tax). So he said sorry and walked away. I called him back and handed out the cashier a couple of coins. The man looked at me and said thanks. In deed ""His clothes were worn and old. He was dirty from head to toe""."
