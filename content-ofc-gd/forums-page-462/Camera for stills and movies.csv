Looking for something no more than $1300.  I have a 1998 Rebel SLR with two lenses (28-80 + 75-300) so it would be nice to be able to use these if possible. Also wouldn't mind someting wider e.g., 15-80.  We want it for better quality stills and the ability to make some home movies. Any advice would be great."
647223,BillM,2011-12-11 02:30:00,17367,My Canon 60D takes some pretty impressive 1080p video...  With an external microphone the audio quality is fantastic.
647286,Twocoda,2011-12-11 06:03:00,4130,Canon http://www.dpreview.com/news/2011/11/4/canondslr4k  Nikon  http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond7000/page18.asp  If you already have Canon you may want to stay with them to utilize your other lenses
647357,Sharkbait22,2011-12-11 16:38:00,297,Thanks for the tips.  It seems DSLRs are becoming movie cameras in some ways.  Based on my reading they typically cannot autofocus during the shoot and create big files quickly.
