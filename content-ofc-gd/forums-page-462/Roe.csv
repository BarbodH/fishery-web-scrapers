647156,spinnerdoc,2011-12-11 00:18:00,556,"Depending on what context, An Ethical Comittee is correct grammar wise  Anyway as for roe, like the op I am new to the sport, and have tried tying myself and it worked out fine, uncured and just tied straight up"
647159,misfish,2011-12-11 00:28:00,29133,  Yes it is.  TY
642530,_Ra_,2011-11-24 02:37:00,16,"Hello,  First of a brief introduction: I recently got into fishing with a few buddies, this is my first season. I've been targeting panfish and Bass so far. I don't know any veteran fishermen so I've been using these forums to learn for the most part before going out and trying stuff out. I've learned a little bit - enough to hook into a few fish and get myself hooked to the sport.   I've been reading up on steelhead recently and I thought I'd give it a try. My plan is to use worm and roe for bait. Can anyone guide me to a baitshop that would sell these in Mississauga? Specifically I'd like to get pretied roe bags as I have no previous experience.   http://centerpinangling.com/spawn-products.html I found I can order them online but the shipping seems quite steep. Also I'd like to go out this Friday and I don't think I'd get them in time. Any help is appreciated!"
642540,Eazy,2011-11-24 03:07:00,260,"Most local baitshops will sell pre-tied roe, but it's pretty pricey stuff as far as my experience goes.  Rolling your own isn't very difficult either, just ask one of your steel-head buddies for a quick run down on how to cure and tie it."
642547,BillM,2011-11-24 03:21:00,17367,"No need to cure it, just tie it up and you're golden."

642550,Roy,2011-11-24 03:27:00,13728,I can't help you with steelheading but welcome aboard. Looking forward to hearing of your progress.
642552,mercman,2011-11-24 03:35:00,7054,Welcome to OFC Theres a ton of world class Steelheaders in here.I'm surprised you only got a few suggestions. Must be a game on somewhere
642563,rocheleauc,2011-11-24 04:47:00,205," x2, just cut up the skein in small pieces, tie it up,  and freeze what ever you're not going to use."
642565,spooner_jr,2011-11-24 05:30:00,193,"Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think Skippy has caught a steelhead/salmon/brown yet, he wants to know where to buy pre-tied eggs so he can try and catch one, not whether he should cure the eggs or not."
642573,Twocoda,2011-11-24 10:44:00,4130,welcome to the board...there is a tackle shop in Port Credit that sells pre tied roe cant remember the name of it though  Good Luck
642599,cuzza,2011-11-24 13:16:00,467,Bronte Outdoor (2560 Shepard Ave) or Angling Specialties (325 Central Pky W - behind Dairy Queen) both sell roe bags and they'll both probably give you some advice too
642617,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-24 14:29:00,0,"Good to see someone taking up the angling art--welcome. Kaveat (and this is, and always will be, my concern): when you source your eggs please ask how and where they were obtained. I think we have an obligation here to help new anglers develop an ethical practice with particular focus on ecological sustainability. Any use of eggs I take to be questionable (just my bias).  I think Kemper can source ""ethical"" spawn  (if I'm not stepping on any toes here).  Best"
642629,_Ra_,2011-11-24 15:04:00,16,"Thanks for all the help guys.  I'll try Angling Specialties for bait. As to the source, I assumed all bait shops get their roe from fish farms.  I'll report back if I have any luck with catching anything... don't hold your breath though!  "
642632,I'mHooked,2011-11-24 15:14:00,525," Good point. How would someone with no experience know what impact ""how and where they were obtained"" would have on his purchase of store bought roe? What criteria would you offer to someone new, such as the OP, to help determine what ARE ethical practices with particular focus on ecological sutainability?"
642650,BillM,2011-11-24 16:42:00,17367, Get all your roe from dirty stockers south of the border.  /Ethical committee.
643349,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-27 03:27:00,0, That should read Ethics Committee--but nice try 
643357,Remastered,2011-11-27 04:36:00,143,You mean go to New York for roe  Which ethical comitee is this?  Hopefully not the one i'm thinking
643399,BillM,2011-11-27 14:22:00,17367," Thanks Dad for the grammar lesson, I appreciate it."
643407,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-27 14:58:00,0,"    No worries, glad to help..."
643619,hoops12,2011-11-28 14:24:00,127,BillM gave me the same advice....NO CURE NEEDED!!  Trust me it works!  Thanks Bill!
643636,BillM,2011-11-28 16:14:00,17367, I know guys that cure roe and they catch as many fish as the guys using uncured stuff.  I think the most important thing is to store it properly... Cured or uncured...
647131,fishinguypat,2011-12-10 22:53:00,547,smuggling roe across the border... tskk tssk
647142,aniceguy,2011-12-10 23:36:00,1094,"All retailers of egg products in the province have to have proof of purchase for the product in thier store from a vendor, usually a fish farm locally or south of the border, it also must be cured in some respect"
647147,BillM,2011-12-10 23:56:00,17367, You aren't smuggling anything.  It's completely legal.
647151,misfish,2011-12-11 00:06:00,29133,"Hey Bill,still going strong with the roe,one bag left."
647152,BillM,2011-12-11 00:07:00,17367,I think that's some Port Hope chinnie roe   Glad it's working for ya!
