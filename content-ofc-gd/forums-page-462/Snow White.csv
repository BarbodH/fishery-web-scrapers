647173,Grimace,2011-12-11 00:55:00,2020,"Awesome!!   There are few of them unusually south this year.  My mother (huge birder) called me the other day to say that some had been sighted near the jobsite I was working on.  I looked all day but didn't see them.   They are daytime hunters so you should be able to catch a glimpse if they are around.  I remember a few years ago when the Great Greys were down south because of the lack of voles up north for some reason.   I took a trip with my parents and saw plenty.  Wicked to see the Great Greys, I hope I can catch a glimpse of a Snowy this year."
