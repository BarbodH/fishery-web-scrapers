645952,RickOnt,2011-12-06 21:28:00,669,Rizzo  Beauty Fish.  By the Pic I would guess mid forties for sure!!  Rick
645990,Rizzo,2011-12-06 23:25:00,4754, that's what I want to hear  . I have one buddy I get out with once or twice a season who likes to sing to the muskies. If I could have him crooning up front and you swooning in the back the fish won't be able to resist!
646041,ccmtcanada,2011-12-07 02:52:00,7971,Awesome way to end the season for you!
646062,cowanjo,2011-12-07 03:34:00,249,Awesome report for all the people on the couch i am jealous. per your pm look forward to sharing a boat in 2012  John
646098,limeyangler,2011-12-07 10:35:00,5204,Nice way to herald the noise of augers.
646108,Billy Bob,2011-12-07 11:08:00,5865,I'm guessing over 5 lbs...and that's a lot of smoked muskie fish sandwiches for ice fishing.  NICE GOING....you couldn't have ended the season on a better note....  Bob
646150,jimmer,2011-12-07 15:01:00,2730,Team work is best!
646242,ehg,2011-12-07 19:33:00,2666,"Must be in the high 40's range, real nice. I wondered if anyone took advantage of the later musky season in Kawarthas now. That is pretty hardcore fishing"
646252,jimmer,2011-12-07 20:05:00,2730,"I did get out on Balsam two weeks ago (nov. 25th) with a Muskie Canada buddy. Fished all day, trolling most of the time. My buddy caught a small one (23"") when we stopped to cast for a bit. I didn't see any trailers at the Nogies creek ramp(Pigeon) on the Saturday when I drove by."
646273,Rizzo,2011-12-07 21:35:00,4754," This is the first year that I have. Usually by late October I get the boat to the Niagara area and fish the upper river a few times before Dec 15. The past few years have been really lousy on the upper so this year I decided just to keep the boat here instead. I don't regret the decision! Doing it this way got me out to Kawarthas probably 3 extra times. Early November we got 2 (38'ish, 45), mid november was a skunking, early december we got this one plus the ""one that got away"". My 3 or 4 trips that I would have done in Niagara likely would not have been as good (based on how lousy we did in the past - 1 fish in 3 trips last year, 1 fish in 4 trips the year before - both mid 30's fish but chunky - they are heavier down there)"
646372,ehg,2011-12-08 03:17:00,2666,I remember back 6-8 yrs. ago there was Niagara River get-togethers where not much was ever caught but you caught a real nice little tiger musky at the time. With the Kawarthas now being open later it should be easier to put 'skis in the boat.
646411,Rizzo,2011-12-08 13:02:00,4754,"wow good memory ehg. I'll see if I can track down the picture later tonight. Gorgeous little fish. I know for years when we'd get together nobody got a dang thing, and finally one year 2 or 3 got caught, I think Adam got a 50? Then there was the year Wayne had to launch his giant boat first to break the ice at the marina. Either way, a 30% success rate was too depressing for me so I took the year off from Niagara. 10 years ago I used to do pretty good down there, but the last 4 or 5 haven't been good"
645437,Rizzo,2011-12-05 01:58:00,4754,"Got out Friday for one last attempt at sliming the boat. Greeted at the launch by a few inches of snow and 38 degree water temps. Thought we'd try jigging steep breaks. Zilch. We did notice though as we got further out from the break there were fish suspended 20 feet down over deeper water. Perfect. Time to sit on my butt and troll for suspended fish...beats banging bottom or casting in -4 weather! Got a real beauty which released itself at boatside, go figure, would have been my best fish of the season. Luckily we did get to see it. A couple of cold hours later we got this fish, the last one of the season for me as I winterized the boat yesterday.    Help me out. My partner ""couldn't find the tape measure"" (he wasn't actually looking now that I think about it) so we quickly let the fish go. Naturally he finds it as soon as the fishes tail kicks out of sight! Likely next time he can't find the camera. I am now accepting resumes for position of ""new fishing partner for next year""  I like to keep a musky log and have guessed a length of this fish, but if anyone wants to make a guess please feel free. If you guys are more generous than me maybe I'll revise my log!"
645438,skeeter,2011-12-05 02:04:00,1907,Stand in front of a mirror in the same position as in the picture. Have somebody else measure from the top your right ear down to the middle of your left knee cap. Should get you pretty close to the right size.
645440,Rizzo,2011-12-05 02:06:00,4754,haha that's way too much work...I'd rather just make a random guess
645442,Roy,2011-12-05 02:10:00,13728,"Dang, none of them are easy guesses, Roger. We (I) could be way off. It's not terribly fat for this time of the year either but I'll go between 45"" and 47"".  A great ending to your season. Congrats."
645445,mercman,2011-12-05 02:24:00,7054,"Beautiful Fish Rizzo !!! I give it 48"" even. Nice way to end the season."
645447,Leecher,2011-12-05 02:34:00,7832,I'd give it high fourties for sure    Congrats Roger    Awesome way to end the   season
645455,Joey,2011-12-05 03:13:00,9122,"Nice ending to the season Rizzo, well except for the lot fish and tape measure   At least you got out, lucky you"
645456,Gregoire,2011-12-05 03:26:00,1397,"Judging by the angle of your right arm, the 38 degree tilt of your head and the expression on the fishes face I would go with 46 inches. Remember that my guess is accurate to within 4.5 inches 17 times out of 20. In all seriousness that is a nice fish to end your season on."
645465,dhickey,2011-12-05 04:43:00,1038,"Sweet fish 47-49"" I dont have a fishing resume. But I can show ya my box"
645473,lew,2011-12-05 10:03:00,12766,"Atta boy Roger, nice way to end the season !!"
645474,crappieperchhunter,2011-12-05 10:32:00,2582,Nice way to end the season.  My guess is 60 x 29.5.  But what do I know
645480,Guest chase4chrome,2011-12-05 12:25:00,0,"Nice torpedo brother!!  Based on your height--fish likely from the top of your head to your knee (or almost), take it from there."
645485,Rizzo,2011-12-05 12:56:00,4754,...welcome to my boat
645488,Nipfisher,2011-12-05 13:15:00,2449,"  If crazy exagerated guesses will get me in your boat I say it is at least 65"" long.  Nice musky. Maybe a new catch and release record?"
645490,scugpg,2011-12-05 13:21:00,1373, Nice catch Rizzo! I'll have my resume to you by EOB
645492,Andy,2011-12-05 13:33:00,330,  That fish makes your Johnson look small. Nice catch!
645494,Squid,2011-12-05 13:45:00,1656,"Nice job Roger!! 48"""
645497,Lunkerhunter,2011-12-05 14:00:00,455,i'd say 45-47 as well. nice fish! too bad about the big one.  cheers
645504,Harrison,2011-12-05 14:20:00,2202,   Nicely done sir.
645511,johnnyb,2011-12-05 15:28:00,3413,Nice way to end the season for sure!  My first thought was around the 47 mark as well....before reading any replies.  
645539,Rizzo,2011-12-05 16:53:00,4754,"thanks guys. We had earlier lost a real good one so this fish ""looked small"" in relative terms. While I was  unhooking it in the water, my buddy tells me the tape measure isn't in the box. At that time I'm thinking it was a low 40's so didn't think much of it. Quickly lift it out of the water, snap a photo and then back into the drink. He opens first compartment and finds the tape as the fish takes off like a shot. It wasn't until I put the picture on the computer that I realized this one was actually decent as well. It's the memory of the one that got away though that'll keep me excited until next June. My previous outing I had been skunked, so at least I can erase the bad taste of that day and think happy thoughts all winter."
645569,ricoboxing,2011-12-05 17:52:00,398,"nice fish. Definitely over 36"". I'm guessing 38""   :clapping:"
645865,jimmer,2011-12-06 14:55:00,2730,"You da man! My hero, someone that can actually catch a muskie in the Kawarthas ( I know lots of you other guys can catch them too). I would put it at 48"" to 50"". As far as a resume: I live on Pigeon Lake, have a box full of lures, am not afraid to do a figure 8, will do the muskie dance if I have to, provide sandwiches and drinks, oh I have a map too! PM the date I start!"
645938,Pigeontroller,2011-12-06 19:38:00,2793,"Nice fish, high 40s"
645939,fishnsled,2011-12-06 19:49:00,3520,Nice fish and a great end to the season.
