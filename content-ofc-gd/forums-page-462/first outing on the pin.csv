646994,spinnerdoc,2011-12-10 03:43:00,556,"Sweet outing outing Miller, i like the last fish...pretty stout and the brown has amazing markings on the gill plate.  Congrats"
647017,EC1,2011-12-10 07:07:00,930,Took me about 10 trips before I got my very first a couple years back. Haven't gotten one since. That's great you went 6 for 9. Go get them again soon!
647043,Ralph Field,2011-12-10 15:00:00,1018,Congratulations on your outing. I know the rings on your rod fit tight but I would strongly recommend that you tape them in place so you can't knock one loose and have your reel fall off.
