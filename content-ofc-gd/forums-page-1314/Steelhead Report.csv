2302,madtekniques,2006-11-19 18:53:00,15,"Got up bright and early this morning in search of some chrome!  Left the appartment at 4:30 to pick up HighDrifter, stopped for some Timmy's and then headed across the 401 to a Lake O. trib.  We met up with my buddy Todd around 5:30 and made it to the creek by 6:00.  By 6:30 we were suited up, geared up and hyped up!  The sun started to come up and by 7:30 we each had a fish.  Not much action after that, one small 8"" bow and that was it.  Fish 1, mine.   Fish 2, HighDrifter.   Fish 3, Todd. (worked a double header with another angler in the pool)   A flash of chrome!   We fished until 11 then called it quits.  Great morning for us all but myself especially since this was my first Steelhead ever!"
