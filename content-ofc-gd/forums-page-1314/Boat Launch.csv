3988,Roy,2006-11-22 21:15:00,13728,"First of all, welcome aboard.  As for the Crystal Beach boat launch. Googling gave me the following:  Crystal Beach Boat Launch Completed in 2000 the Waterfront Park and Boat Ramp is located at the end of Ridgeway Road in Crystal Beach. The boat ramp will open for business in May and will remain open until mid September. There is no admission fee for use of the boat ramp. The Crystal Beach Waterfront Park itself offers a picnic pavilion, washroom facilities and ample space for parking"

If you have a large boat, there is a ramp just down river from the peace brigde. Its next to Nichols marine and there is parking there. Hopes this help. Good fishing."
