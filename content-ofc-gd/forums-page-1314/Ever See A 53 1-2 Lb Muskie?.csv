3680,PIKEMAN330,2006-11-22 03:04:00,10,Last time we fished there it was our best day of musky fishing ever and there was no one there but us.
3185,DrPhil,2006-11-21 06:42:00,30,This fish was taken by Howard Wagner recently from the upper Niagara River.  It weighed in at 53 1/2 lbs and had a girth of 28 inches.  Howard is one of Pennsylvania's top musky men and released the fish.
