3222,Chris,2006-11-21 13:02:00,405,"Hi, thought some of you may be interested in seeing this pic of the earliest full fossil of an esox type fish on record. This fossil was found in the 70's in Alberta and is called ""Esox Tiemani"". It was discovered in the western portion of the province in what is known as the Paskapoo Formation from the Paleocene period (approx. 60 million yrs. ago). It is small in size at only about 13"" length, but if one looks closely there is even a fossil bait fish in it's belly. Picture courtesy of Dr. Mark V.H. Wilson of the University of Alberta.  "
