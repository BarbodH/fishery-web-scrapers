3581,Gerritt,2006-11-22 00:37:00,6129,Sooo when we playing air hockey!!!! I am the king of the world on the white stuff!   Gerritt.
3585,outdoorguy61,2006-11-22 00:40:00,220,I think I drove by their place in Eufala Alabama before (that is where I was and believe this is the same company). I am always curious and would have enjoyed a tour.  outdoorguy61
3587,camillj,2006-11-22 00:45:00,1988,ROTFLMAO Gerritt ... nice pic
3604,jediangler,2006-11-22 01:10:00,1923,"Hey Outdoorguy, you should have stopped in to Mann's in Eufaula Ala. They had a real cool aquarium with a 16lb largemouth in it when I visited there in 1989. Also had some gar pike, big crappie, and albino catfish. I couldn't stock up on any lures as I was driving my motorcycle at the time. They had some real unique ideas for lures and soft plastics, if I remember correctly. Very nice people as well. It is located right on the border between Alabama & Georgia, on the shore of Lake Eufaula."
3609,outdoorguy61,2006-11-22 01:16:00,220,"When I am away with work and have some free time and a neat place to potentially see, I like to ask for a tour. I would have enjoyed seeing the bass and any other unique prototypes (the quirkier the better.)Leatherman while in Portland Oregon was a neat one, as is Scott Plastics (Scotty downriggers) in Victoria.  outdoorguy61"
3654,Greencoachdog,2006-11-22 02:30:00,8163," Sorry to say but Tom Manns fish World is no longer. I fish the AGC tourney down there every April and it has been closed for several years... but do stop in at Lakepoint state park and rent a boat to do a little fishin', even if ya don't catch anything... the wild Alligators are awesome to see!... did I mention that you'll be in a 12 foot tinny and there are 16 foot Alligators there?... not to worry though, they're harmless"
3669,Fisheye,2006-11-22 02:54:00,15,"Mike, nice looking baits! They're going to look good in the Fisheye box! LOL! Mike, don't you just bend the snap to tune them? I had trouble with a LEO and called Todd from Leo Lures and he told to bend the snap! And vualla, there it was, tuned! See you at the meeting tomorrow night!  Paul."
3947,Handlebarz,2006-11-22 19:41:00,3790,Outdoorguy yep it was from Eufaula  see ya tonight paul  I will post a pic later if I have time of the lip and eye placement they have a cool design for these baits its not just a eye they have a self centering system that is very cool cant wait to run one of these new ones I just wonder why they did not put the new system on the sea snakes to make them run better.
