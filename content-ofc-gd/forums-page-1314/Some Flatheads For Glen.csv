3487,Whopper,2006-11-21 21:44:00,2174,"Nice cats chiefvail. There a guy on a local board that brags about getting them out of the GMR down your way. I know those weren't from GMR but nice fish, Lake Monroe is a nice lake.  Whopper"
3503,aplumma,2006-11-21 22:10:00,6896,Nice cats bud. On the second picture I havent seen a face like that since I was Noodling and the fish had a good bite on the hand going.  Art
3524,Greencoachdog,2006-11-21 22:37:00,8163,"Excellent Catfish Chief! Did you take them on a rod and reel, troutline, jugs, or set lines (limb lines)?"
3533,Daplumma,2006-11-21 22:55:00,1961,Thems some big ol fatties there.Nothin I would eat but fun to chase! Joe
3564,tomO,2006-11-22 00:08:00,363,They say the bigger they are the better they taste around here. I'll take there word on it.
3593,GbayGiant,2006-11-22 00:59:00,1780,"Looks like the one cat tried to get your beer and your fighting to get it back,lol."
3597,Daplumma,2006-11-22 01:02:00,1961,Around here the larger have soft and yellow meat.They fry up a little tough.I prefer to eat the 12 to 18 inch ones but love to catch the big ones.Very strong fish. Joe
3606,tomO,2006-11-22 01:13:00,363,"I've never seen any of the meat. I release everything. Heck when I'm in canada I very seldom keep one. I cut meat all week and the last thing I wanna do on a day off or on vacation is cut into a critter, thats why I don't hunt any more. Yes they are strong fish My biggest so far last summer was 26 lbs and put up a heck of a fight once it saw the boat I'm lookin forward to catching bigger ones."
3788,john vail,2006-11-22 13:30:00,67,"Glen, I use 10' ugly sticks with either 4500 shamiano baitrunners or 6500 series abu reels with 30lb. p-line, and oh yea, my muskie net."
3822,Greencoachdog,2006-11-22 14:59:00,8163," You done good Chief!!!... usually when somebody tells me they caught a big Catfish aound here and shows me a pic, I ask them if they caught it on a rod and reel... they say no, I caught it on a trotline, jug or limb line. Any knuclehead can catch them that way."
