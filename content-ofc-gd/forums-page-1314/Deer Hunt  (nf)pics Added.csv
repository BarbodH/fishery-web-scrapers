1960,Daplumma,2006-11-19 00:16:00,1961,"Just finished having the traditional hanging loin venison sandwich.oinons,mushrooms and the hanging loins fried in butter and served on a baguette.It dont get no better than that!!Do y'all cut the hanging loins out up there?? Joe"
2136,fatdaddy,2006-11-19 13:38:00,19,"MMMMMMMMMM, Deer tenders.....(drool)  I always carefully remove the tenderloins from any deer and moose that we get.  They are delicious  I have heard stories of unscrupulous butchers who sometimes 'cough' ""misplace"" the tenders during the butchering process  Always eaten at camp, roll them in black pepper and coarse salt, and fry in butter, or wrap in tinfoil with a couple pats of butter and place on the coals.  8 minutes, then flip over, 8 more and enjoy!"
2137,tjsa,2006-11-19 13:38:00,1578,We do Joe if we butcher it ourselves.
2198,cisco,2006-11-19 15:57:00,597,"Congrats Joe!  Up here we even do jackrabbit (European hare)tenderloins by ""unrolling"" em with a knife and frying in butter. Oh and that deer sure is riding in style on that tractor! LOL!!!!!"
2226,aplumma,2006-11-19 16:50:00,6896,Its kind of deceiving but that is a 5 foot bucket on the New holland tractor he is riding in.We had to roll his butt to the back and curve his neck out the front to get him to fit.   Art
2254,crappiesteve,2006-11-19 17:37:00,220,"Nice buck aplumma,now send me my steak lol. Hope all is well with you two.My puter has been down for awhile,too much juice comming from the main line aparently,take care will ttyl.  Steve"
2258,Gerritt,2006-11-19 17:42:00,6129,and to think I just spent over 40 bux for some venison... 2 steaks and about 7 sausages... Grrrrr.... bambi sure is expensive!!!  Gerritt.

2474,motv8tr,2006-11-20 01:44:00,2587,"Hey Joe, I thought you just hunted them with a paint ball  Me, yesterday I packed 5 bins of bones and scaps for the dogs, did another tonight, have 3 more to go.  Going to have to repack my freezer   .  Nothing better than a winters load of free dog food  Maureen"
2478,Daplumma,2006-11-20 01:54:00,1961,"Good for you Mo.Venison for the pups??Good lean meat they are gonna love it!I have been known to paitball a few deer in the garden in the summer but this one showed no signs of being painted!Art dreads that early morning phone call from the tree stand.""Hey Art,get the tractor,we got a deer to gut"".He always says,I'll be there in a few minutes.That dude has gutted and skinned more deer than most people and he doesn't even hunt that often. Joe"
