3791,lew,2006-11-22 13:42:00,12767,Gorgeous pickeral Bill and congrats on your PB  About 10 years ago my son and I were camped on Adolphus Reach when that ESSROC freighter went by and she thru up such a huge wave that it tore my boat from the dock and shoved it right up on the beach  Luckily the only damage done was to the cleats that were ripped outta the dock.
3179,MuskyBill,2006-11-21 05:45:00,311,"My first ever trip to The BoQ was awesome. Unfortuately, due to circumstances beyond my control & an early sack time on Saturday night, I couldn't make it to Merlands from The Harbour Inn. I'll see most of you in February in Innisfil.....  Anyways, I took some cool shots of some of the many types of boats that could be seen all over The Reach on Saturday....  Trawlers....    Freighters...    Trawlers AND Freighters...    What was the other kind???  Oh yeah, TANKERS!!!!!    Yup, I think I'll try that place out again some day...hmmmm, do I have any more vac-time left...."

3317,irishfield,2006-11-21 16:24:00,26272,"LOL Bill...trawlers, freighters and tankers!! Beauty fish bud.

3329,LeXXington,2006-11-21 16:40:00,1928,"LOL, Bill that was a cool pic,  Great too have you out..."
3331,irishfield,2006-11-21 16:45:00,26272, Yep...I just hope I don't drive mine like all the ones we went head to head with....crowding us into the shoreline...cutting us off to the point I could bang my planner board off their transom etc. I'm gonna Krazy Glue exacto knife refill blades to the front edge of my boards for next year.
3332,fishnsled,2006-11-21 16:51:00,3520, A knife on the front of the boards eh?  Now that's a great tip!    There certainly were a few idiots doing that Wayne.  Why can't we all just get along.
3333,jason27fish,2006-11-21 17:02:00,90,wow nice fish
3542,fishindevil,2006-11-21 23:12:00,6254,ya i was right in front of the ferry when that huge tanker went right by me about 200ft away i made sure to get right the hell out of his way thats for sure......   the nerve of him to screw up my trolling direction  ....lol....lol
3661,MuskyBill,2006-11-22 02:41:00,311,"The first Freighter on Sat. was really movin'....  Being the rookies we are, we had to start our turn real early when we saw him comin', full steam ahead....  The 2nd Freighter was much easier to deal with. I thought it was kinda neat to be sharin' the water with these guys....."
3729,ehg,2006-11-22 04:33:00,2666,"Great post and fish!  cheers,  ehg"
