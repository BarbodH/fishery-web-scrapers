3657,camillj,2006-11-22 02:34:00,1988,  You da man Lloyd !
2373,GNODDY,2006-11-19 22:37:00,163,Myself and one of my best fishing buddys joined FishHunter on the U&ME boat for the BEST fishing I have ever had.  First fish of the Mornin   then this badboy   Nice size eye   Then a little smaller but still good size   Another one    This one also beauty I should of had a pic in between there of the biggest fish of the day but it slipped off the netDAMMM ITT   Another one!   Always nice when you get a double Header   and another    and another    So in total we went 13 for 14 with the biggest fish of that day getting of at the net which was my fault. We had so much fun and lucked out with the waether it was a gorgeous day. All Fish we caught were anywhere from 6lbs to the biggest at 12 lbs I am super glad we could tag along Thanks Fishhunter you da Man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2381,setomonkey,2006-11-19 23:05:00,872,"Congrats, some great-looking 'eyes!  Were you at the Quinte g2g?  Mike"
2385,fishhunter,2006-11-19 23:11:00,604,Your most welcome!!  Always nice to take OFC boys out for a day of eye hunting
2388,jason27fish,2006-11-19 23:14:00,90,wow nice eyez
2394,tjsa,2006-11-19 23:26:00,1578,"I rarely find fish that size, maybe in the 8 lb. range, but that is the reality of where I fish. BOQ is a much different place, seen pics and videos of fishing there, size wise, its foreign to me. Not that I do not like the size of the fish I catch, but would dearly love to tangle with some that size.  Good going Gnoddy, and thanks for the report."

2508,Big Swede,2006-11-20 03:03:00,23,Great haul guys! Looks like from a couple of recent posts that the bruisers are still east of the Ferry. What lures and colours were working for you? Sounds like purple and white were good choices but just wondering if you noticed the same or different.
