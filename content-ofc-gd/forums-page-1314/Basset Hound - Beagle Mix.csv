(on the old board) And it just so happens that my ""grandmother-in-law"" is looking to give her beagle / basset hound mix puppy away.  The pup is about 6 months old and was given to her as a gift, but Grandma doesn't feel up to taking care of another dog.  If you were the person seeking a pup, or if you're somebody else looking for a fishing partner let me know and i'll get some pics!  I'd take her if I could but i've already got a Beagle a Yorkie and a Baby! haha  Cheers, UF"
