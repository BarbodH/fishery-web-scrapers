1931,kennyman,2006-11-18 22:57:00,737,"Great info guys. What colours/patterns are you using? So for example if I bought a husky jerk, would you go silver/black or perch, both etc. ??? For what target species?If anyone is adding to this list the more specific you get the better it will be for ""us newbies"" here (I know some of you already were specfic,thanks). You don't have to let us in on ALL your secrets, but I for one can use all the help I can get. Is anyone using anything unusual that most anglers would say ""would never work"" but are having success with it themselves?"
1938,ChrisK,2006-11-18 23:11:00,2772,"My all time favourite lure would be the red and white Daredevil..Not because of its fish catching abilities but because it reminds me of the days spent fishing with my dad when I was young fella...He would open his box and pick out a bait for me to cast and 9 times out of ten it would be a redn'white daredevil....I caught smallmouth and pike mostly on them but only because of the water we were fishin back then....  My other two choices would be, Bucktails and Super Shad Raps  Cheers !!"
1967,Lungelarry,2006-11-19 00:30:00,294,"I don,t have a favorite, I try to use what the fish want, you must know what species your after and what time of year(spring ,summer,fall patterns) and that generally dictates  what lures you should use.. I know I don,t like spinnerbaits....tooo easy...cast and reel...cast and reel...cast and reel...."

418,kennyman,2006-11-16 17:12:00,737,I was enjoying reading about everyones favorite lures and now that the thread will be closing I thought it would be great to continue it here. This time your top three or four lures would be incredibly educational (and much appreciated) tool for myself and I'm sure others here. Next time I go shopping I'll be bringing a list compiled from the knowledge gained in this thread. I guess even though I'm a novice I'll start.  2. Hula Popper (frog pattern)  4. Storm Rattlin Chug (blue/silver shad). Topwater is my favorite.

Lots of x-rap fans on OFC but I've only got one and haven't really used it much yet.  Chartreuse/white spinnerbaits.  Hula popper. Nothing beats topwater action! My PB LM was on a Hula popper.  Twister tail jigs. Catch everything on these, bass, pike, walleye...  Mike"

1158,OhioFisherman,2006-11-17 14:09:00,6623,"My favorite would be a buzzbait, there is nothing like snaking one thru the lilies and seeing the water explode. I don`t use them as often as I should, just because other lures have a better hook up ratio.  Plastic worms and lizards, just for me a go to lure, they can be fished almost anywhere and the hook-up rate is high.  Jig and pig, jig and plastic, they will still catch a lot of fish.  Tubes my favorite multi species lure.  Really no favorites to speak of, I use them all until I figure out what is working best and where I find the fish."

1442,Matt15,2006-11-17 20:23:00,107,The two lures i use the most are strike king spinnerbaits and a jighead with a white grub when fishing for bass.  For musky I like big spinnerbaits.

1674,Weeds,2006-11-18 04:29:00,782,"1) Pretty much any spinnerbait-they generally don't break the bank, you can toss the heavier ones a mile, they rarely snag up and if you do lose em you're not out an arm and a leg. Plus they're fun to use. 2) Kinda keen on my Storm Deep Thunder right now too, another cheapie (relatively) and seems to have a nice action/wiggle to it."
