3995,snag,2006-11-22 21:24:00,1932,CUT THE LINE!    CUT THE LINE!! CUT THE LINE!!   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
3483,snag,2006-11-21 21:31:00,1932,"O.k the title, Snag is having a really bad run of bad luck lately.  Premature Evacuation: Losing fish moments before landing them.  I would say I lose 30% of my fish because I normally don't use a net. I believe I lost a possible PB today- Pike 40"" range. I am bitter.  Went to Gbay last week Saw the biggest muskie of my life follow on glass-like water. Soiled meeself. It was moving sooooo slow. It had a head like Ernest Borgnine - Massive  Got shaken down by da fuzz (OPP and CO together. They were great)  Caught some pike. Really, really scrappy. Yeehaw  0-5KM WINDS, stunning glass water and nooooobody around   Hunter scum- I filed a complaint with the CO about this    Hey, yous guys got any gobie I could use fer bait?  No, are you allergic to Latex, sir? Oh, geez  Some pike   This is from Niagara   Well, that's it.  Later,  Snag"
3491,b2kptbo,2006-11-21 21:48:00,1505,"Good report, kinda twisted but still good  ... Ya thinks da fuzz seen ya stach the beer can by da shells???"
3496,The Urban Fisherman,2006-11-21 21:51:00,2050,as per usual - great report.  Smart move blurring out that last one though! Dont' want anybody to head out after that monster pike!  UF
3499,Greencoachdog,2006-11-21 22:00:00,8163,
3500,douG,2006-11-21 22:02:00,2693,Head like Ernest Borgnine.  Hilarious!  Anyone remember Shack?  
3506,wishn4fishn,2006-11-21 22:14:00,108,try to think of it as long distance release  good stuff
3694,snag,2006-11-22 03:10:00,1932,"  OMG  YOU FOUND HIS PICTURE!  Doug, your great!  O.k. now picture him following a lure to your canoe, on a big lake, alone, scared.  "
3696,Rizzo,2006-11-22 03:11:00,4754,gotta love those muskies with big noggins.  But Borgnine big? That's a fish
3700,snag,2006-11-22 03:14:00,1932,  Turn your initials around.   
3702,Rizzo,2006-11-22 03:16:00,4754,"guy, you're killing me...wife thinks I'm nuts for laughing at computer"
3703,snag,2006-11-22 03:16:00,1932,"  Uh,  look closer my friend,  Bud!   'nuff said"
3706,Rich,2006-11-22 03:24:00,3927,Great report Snag.  XOXOXO
3708,snag,2006-11-22 03:33:00,1932," Why do I still see you naked?   I would use a net if I could carry one easily.  Why don't you wear clothes?    LIAR!!   Your wife is right here!  Right Rizza,    Grrrrrrrrrrrrr"
3714,Greencoachdog,2006-11-22 03:47:00,8163,"Why do I still see you naked?... it's my little ""treat"" to the world! I would use a net if I could carry one easily... if it was easy, we'd have women and children fishin' for Musky!  Why don't you wear clothes?... why don't you wear a body condominium when you fish for Salmon?... instead of sitting by the phone at home... hoping they'll call."
3728,snag,2006-11-22 04:22:00,1932," Yay,  GCD is stalking me!"
3757,Greencoachdog,2006-11-22 11:27:00,8163," Huh!... you should be so lucky!...eh?  I thought we were playin' ""Tag""...  If yer skeered... say yer skeered!   ..."
3783,ccmtcanada,2006-11-22 13:19:00,7971,Ok...first...this is yet another hilarious thread by Snag....thanks for that....  I do notice a pattern though...they all start about fish and degrade into....oh well...what can ya do...
3844,Joey,2006-11-22 15:26:00,9122,Thanks for the laughs guys.  Now if only I could get GCD to stalk me  Joey
3914,highdrifter,2006-11-22 17:48:00,2534,"Ahaha!  I can only imagine how the idea of Ernest Borgnine came to play..  But I luuuv it!  Grant, we need to talk about your ratios.  Let's not stray from the subject here.  You require professional help.  You're beyond help, but I could offer some guidance, dear sir.  We need to dissect your hook set, playing and landing techniques.  then and only then will we be able to get to the root of this terrible affliction.  hehehe  HD"
3921,snag,2006-11-22 17:58:00,1932," Yeah,  I need an intervention.  The playing and landing are impared. Mostly the latter.  Help meeeeee"
3925,ccmtcanada,2006-11-22 18:06:00,7971,This may help out with your premature evacuation.....    Give it a try and lemme know how it works out.
3952,snag,2006-11-22 20:02:00,1932,"Thanks,  However, the problem was getting it out, not up.  Is that lure only for hard water application?"
3966,ccmtcanada,2006-11-22 20:40:00,7971," The website said something about ""Those embarassing situations....""  I think the idea has more to do with CCCCCCOLD water and the problem you are having.....hey...if it helps keep it on for just a few more yards, it could have made all the difference."
3971,douG,2006-11-22 20:56:00,2693,"Snag, just rent 'Emperor of the North Pole' to see Borgie as Mr. Shack.  That will exorcise your demons, fer sure.  I saw that one about 30 years ago.  Unforgettable.  Definitely a guy's movie."
3974,SlowPoke,2006-11-22 21:02:00,2984,You don't know the meaning of scared until you have had this follow up to the boat...
