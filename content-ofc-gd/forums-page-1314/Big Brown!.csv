2916,Fishingelbow,2006-11-20 22:07:00,2,Wow! I can't believe how far and how fast those big brownies travel. Markus' fish was caught and released hundreds of miles away just two days ago!  
2929,lilkynan,2006-11-20 22:32:00,173,Awesome!!
2936,fishindevil,2006-11-20 22:38:00,6254,"WOW,they are some real pretty browns   way to go and a great report"
3363,jason27fish,2006-11-21 17:38:00,90,those are nice browns   those walleye are also hogs love to catch one of those
3595,sleded,2006-11-22 01:00:00,96,Seems like everyone has caught that fish   Me and rich were at BOQ and caught a couple nice ones 
2649,Markus,2006-11-20 14:29:00,25,"What a day!  Hit the local trib with my buddy and man am I glad we did!  First up was Jammer!  He landed a pig of a brown!  22lbs!  Caught on a 8 foot rod, with 8lb mainline and 6lb leader line bouncing bottom.    The fishing gods must have been feeling extremely generous, because my luck would be equally as good!  Another 22lb brown!!  What are the odds?    Now before everyone starts thinking that's the same fish, I just want to reasure you that it was caught in a totally different place.  This is one of the best fish I have every caught in my life!  So I took some time and got a really great picture.  Does anyone know what the Ontario Record is for Brown Trout?    In all seriousness, I want to say congratulations to Mike, a new local to our area.  He caught a pig of a brown trout and deserves a huge pat on the back for it too.  Fish of a lifetime as far as I'm concerned.  Just a shame it got pulled into a silly childish crap storm of Bull.  Congrats on your catch Mike!  I'm still drooling!  ...and I'm looking forward to meeting you on the water some day to share a few laughs.  "

2654,Guest mistyriver1,2006-11-20 14:40:00,0,Very nice.
2662,SHAD,2006-11-20 14:54:00,134,"What are the odds!  4 people have now recently got into 22lb browns, what a dang' fish class that strain must be, I am moving to Port Dover!!!"
2665,Fish Farmer,2006-11-20 14:58:00,2234,"Good one Markus  , you had me looking  . That is truly a nice Brown of a life time. Thanks for posting. Were heading back to Quinte Wens. How about you?"
2668,Markus,2006-11-20 15:05:00,25," FF, we were there yesterday working the walleye.  No iants for us, just your typical BOQ toads.     Good luck on Wednesday!"
2672,Fish Farmer,2006-11-20 15:10:00,2234,"Nice fish Markus, I hope we do half as good. Thanks FF"
2683,Joey,2006-11-20 15:28:00,9122,"What a beautiful Brown, yes he does deserve a pat on the back.  Nice job.  Joey"
2686,setomonkey,2006-11-20 15:31:00,872,Those are huge browns!  Congrats!  Mike
2689,TroutSlayer,2006-11-20 15:43:00,64,You haven't changed a bit Markus!  Still catching the hogs I see.
2701,fishdawg,2006-11-20 16:05:00,912,
2702,BrownTown,2006-11-20 16:05:00,103,excellent looking fish..not as big at rich's but hell!!!
2714,Squid,2006-11-20 16:36:00,1656,"MArkus, is this the same brown that you posted on NFN, that Mike caught?"
2716,Markus,2006-11-20 16:41:00,25,"Squid, Mikes buddy posted it on NFN yes.  It's also been posted here on OFC and other boards by another individually falsely claiming to have caught it though.  It's good to see credit being given to the correct person.  It's not everyday one of those are caught.  Heck of a fish."
2728,Squid,2006-11-20 17:06:00,1656,Thanks Bud that is what I thought also.
2746,Guest gbfisher,2006-11-20 17:34:00,0,A fisherman who makes up story's..  . Now who would figure?!?!  
2790,Cookslav,2006-11-20 18:48:00,1457,Thats a pig!!!  Congrats to th REAL Angler
2824,GbayGiant,2006-11-20 19:33:00,1780,"Those are some monsters, very nice fish."
2842,jordan,2006-11-20 19:58:00,136,Holy those fish are tanks i could not imagine reeling in one of those. W2G   jordan
2845,TroutSlayer,2006-11-20 20:05:00,64,Ah!  Mike caught it!  Now I understand!  Thanks lads!
2848,TJQ,2006-11-20 20:06:00,7806,Ya.. wow.. nice pickerals too!! Ive never caught a brown trout...
2851,PAZE,2006-11-20 20:09:00,132,"The only thing different about the top two pics is the faces, great work on the photoshop."
2862,kemper,2006-11-20 20:27:00,2232,"How far away was the second one caught..because as far as I can tell that absolutley IS the same fish. Theres too many markings that are exactly the same for it to be a different fish.  A nice one yes, but definatly one and not two.  Now that I read the post again...and notice that it is the same picture flipped around with a face edited in I realize that I was definatly in the wrong.  Sorry and nice fish!"
2864,Crazyhook,2006-11-20 20:34:00,1154,Both fish are awesome !great work Markus
2866,TroutSlayer,2006-11-20 20:38:00,64,I think those two Browns are related!  Probably cousins.
