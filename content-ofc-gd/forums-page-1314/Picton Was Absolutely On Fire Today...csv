2398,jason27fish,2006-11-19 23:32:00,90,nice fish man but i think u should have kept that first fish.....that blood indicates damage to the fish and it will most likely die.....but i like the rest of the fish
2457,fishindevil,2006-11-20 01:10:00,6254,"way to go guys ,great report and pics  and ya quinte was hot all weekend i seen lots of fish caught as well i did good to going 6 for 9 myself ,alone fishing all weekend,what kinda vehicle was that cause i seen him too almost hit me after passing me......"
2461,Matt15,2006-11-20 01:17:00,107,"Great report, nice eyes"
2476,RSB,2006-11-20 01:46:00,9," Hey Jason, you could be right, I have no idea. I do know I seen the blood and wiped it off and waited a few seconds.. NO MORE BLOOD, I figured it was just a little blood due to the hooks.. I even looked under the gill plates to see if there was any visable damage..I did not see any so I let her go, not that it means anything, but she did take off like a bullet..    Snagmasteral, OK, how do you have one of those hats??   What's your handle over on the other board??  RSB!!"
2483,Slyatv,2006-11-20 02:09:00,45,Sure Sure ..Now is the day you chose to catch fish ....   Couldn't be when I was with you LOL Look's Like a great day...   TAKE ME ! ! LOL ....
2489,RSB,2006-11-20 02:22:00,9,"Hey Sly, as I recall you got a hog of your own when we went.. Not sure if you want your pic posted BUT this was the one YOU got was it not??? When I got the ol' skunkaroo..    We'll go   again, no worries bro.. I got to get a couple more of those purple wonders..  RSB!!"
2550,Beans,2006-11-20 04:21:00,3339,Holy Crap !!!...Those are some real hogs George...damn near as big as those carp I netted for you behind the canoe club...LOL
2782,oldphart,2006-11-20 18:27:00,665,"~~~~Hey buddy thought I saw you down there one Saturday, but wasn't sure, we ended up with only one for the 2 days down there, oh well always next year"
2794,Guest gbfisher,2006-11-20 18:58:00,0,".Holly frig.  .......  ...........RSB fishing and catching something other than perch, whitefish or laketrout and posting it on another site other than the XXXXXX site..  WGT George!. Glad to see you are broadening your horizons. Thanks for the report and pictures!  "
2798,Rich Clemens,2006-11-20 19:05:00,3131,Wow !   THat must have been the trip of a lifetime.  Some real beauties there.   Sounds like this trip desreves another.   Thanks for sharing.
2809,dsn,2006-11-20 19:17:00,1018,Wow I can't believe I missed this report. Nice going RSB and your bro.
2817,Northwoodslivin,2006-11-20 19:23:00,2,"Hey guy's  Just wanted to comment on your fish.. Nice Eye's! I can't wait for the ice up here, almost there I'll be sure to make some report's of my own when that time come's"
2825,LeXXington,2006-11-20 19:36:00,1928,Great going looks like you hit the mother load... Yeap that was us going the 75k  When the boat tarp is up it's only rated for 80K  See you next year
2952,Carp,2006-11-20 22:57:00,1488,SWEET WALLYS.  Very nice day for you.
2975,irishfield,2006-11-20 23:46:00,26272,"Great report !!! Saturday WAS the day for sure in between the ""warm"" front going out an the cold front moving in. Wish our charter with Lloyd had of been Saturday vs Friday when we spent 10 hours in 40 gusting 69K ..all for two fish. Mine was 31.5 x 12 lbs+  As for someones comment about your bleeding fish...it had a much better chance than the @$$.... we TIMED netting and releasing via a two handed underhand basket ball shot into the lake after 6+ minutes in the boat taking pictures!"
3062,cisco,2006-11-21 02:03:00,597,Congrats on the big fish Wayne. Sorry to hear about the 6 minute photo shoot guy........  Wonder where he got the dumb idea that to delay release like that is legal/OK?  Hurts to see such irreverence practiced in the field.
3161,Guest gbfisher,2006-11-21 04:10:00,0,Nothing wrong with a picture.   Some people don't know how to take pics or how to release a fish. Fish survive a cut now and then or there would be dead fish all over the place just from being hooked.....
4159,ravinerat,2006-11-23 02:26:00,64,Those are some nice fish RSB. Looks like another productive day on Quinte. We'll be there in 6 wks.  RR
2029,RSB,2006-11-19 03:30:00,9,"Not to mention a LITTLE busy.. hahahaha.. I seen a few OFC'rs out there, passed on the hwy 33 who was doing 75 in an 80 zone.. THE NERVE..  That was me who honked at you as I passed..   Hope you guys have a blast at the M&G!!   It was truly a trip of a life time.. Something that I don’t think will ever happen again.. My brother and I got started just before 8:00.. Shortly after 8:00, a dippsy goes and my brother lands the first fish, a nice 29”, 10.2 lb beauty.. The 10 lb marker is officially broken.. hehehehehe.. BUT not by me, YET..    Back she goes..    OK, we are off to a good start..  My turn, not long after a planer goes and I get the twin of the first.. Just over 29.5” and 10.1 Ibs.. NOW we are talking..    Back she goes.. WOW, what a start..    Again, set back up, go to lite a smoke, dippsy goes off again, DAMN BROTHER, it’s his turn..    The BIGGEST pickerel I have ever seen, 31.5” and 11.6 lb’s… OMG.. Our first three fish were ALL over 10 lbs..    By 9:30 we were 4 for 6.. I thought, Man what a day.. MAN WAS I IN FOR A SURPRISE..    We ended up getting FIVE the were over 10 lbs and we lost one that I know was that big.. We could not catch a keeper..    At one point, I had to put the boat in neutral.. One fish just landed and released and then another rod goes off, WHILE I was doing a circle.. hahahaha.. I actually felt like there was to much going on, PUT THE DAMN  BOAT IN NUTERAL..    We did end up with 4 that were between 3 and 5 lbs that we kept for some good feeds.. And believe it or not, we ended up going 14 for 17..    All fish weighed on a Rapal scale.. All fish released appeared to swim away with no problems..  Like I said, a trip of a life time and I don’t think it will ever happen again, BUT IT DID happen and all I can say is …. WOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOO  BTW - COOL NEW BOARD!!  RSB!!"
2031,Moosebunk,2006-11-19 03:35:00,3970,"Great day for sure man.  And some eater size too, that's uncommon I'm told. lol."

2053,Rizzo,2006-11-19 04:26:00,4754,wow those are some awesome fish.  I've never got one over 10 pounds and you guys get several in a day
2060,kemper,2006-11-19 04:34:00,2232,Wow.   theres really nothing else to say
2067,GbayGiant,2006-11-19 04:41:00,1780,"Hard to beat a day like that ! I wonder if there were any super tankers in there with that school considering you guys were averaging 9lbs, lol."
2068,caper,2006-11-19 04:49:00,210,Great report and nice going on the fish..
2069,Big Swede,2006-11-19 04:52:00,23,"Nice work out there guys! This would have been the weekend I was planning on heading up but I went to Moon instead last week.   Man, when it's on, it's on!  Whereabouts in Picton were you guys working? I've had luck just east of the ferry, near the cement plant and in the actual harbour at night. And what were you trolling? Mine were caught on Clown Coloured Taildancers during the day and floating stickbaits at night.  Thanks for sharing!"
2071,snag,2006-11-19 04:57:00,1932,C'mon now!  Dang I was there last year at this time and nothing compared to that!!!!  Well done!

2110,RSB,2006-11-19 11:59:00,9,"THANKS FOLKS!!  Big Swede, we were working the area east of the ferry to just past the yellow bouy.. I tried to stay away from the crowds.. Most people seemed to be hugging the south shore for some reason.. As for the lures, the colour was purple and white.. The usual suspects did not work so good.. We got three on the Manns 20, BB Muffin and Dr D.. BUT Rapala kicked ass..  BigChev4X4 - Hope you are recovery my friend.. The auger blades will be replace soon and a drilling we will go..   As for the VEX, well, I did buy the FL 20 and I now have an FL 18 I'm not sure what I am going to do with..  Hey Dan The Man... To bad my brother didn't undo his floater suite.. hehehehe.. You would have seen your FAVORITE logo.. You know, that UGLY CH.. You hab fans..  RSB!!"
