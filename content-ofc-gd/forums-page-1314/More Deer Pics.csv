If ever there was to be a case of Buck Fever, that would have been it. Clean and fast, no tracking to be done. The other one is a nice little doe I got out of a tree stand at 80 yards with my boss's 12 ga It had a red dot scope on it and I was impressed at how accurate it was. (heart shot) Got both of these deer last year in Kirkfield.  Didn't get to go this year.  Stan "
1922,Pigeontroller,2006-11-18 22:33:00,2793,Isn't it more humane to just shoot them?
1956,Daplumma,2006-11-19 00:10:00,1961,THATS funny!!I dont care who you are!!Nice deer! Joe
1957,bigfish1965,2006-11-19 00:11:00,3382,I didn't even know they made deer snares.
1963,fishinfool,2006-11-19 00:24:00,366,You guys are wayyyyy to funny!! Feel free to lose this pic if you feel so inclined. Today was the last day for hunting with slugs in my WMU and I was thinking about deer (the four legged variety) Did anyone else have any luck this year?
1970,tjsa,2006-11-19 00:34:00,1578,"My bud's dad's deer from 2 weekends ago. Not a biggun, but he was happy.   Another buds deer last monday, rattled it in. Could only see the head and neck through the trees.   My best bud's deer, yesterday. "

2273,misfish,2006-11-19 18:09:00,29133,"All I can say is, WOW all nice deer.Congrats to all those that were succesful in your harvest.  I went 0-1 last weekend at pops.  Im down to the rest of the season with the bow.MAN I WISH IT WOULD GET COLD AND SNOW.   Hey Duber,thats one nice meat hanger dude."
2293,Daplumma,2006-11-19 18:29:00,1961,"Jason,That looks like nice midwestern deer.Good job. Joe"
2471,oxcowboy,2006-11-20 01:39:00,544,"this is a nice buck an amish man took opening day of bow season.  the deer was killed about 10 miles from my farm.  it should be #2 all time in ohio after it dries.  the only kicker is due to his religion hes not allowed to market the rack, or be photographed with it.  jason"
2482,Daplumma,2006-11-20 02:00:00,1961,Thats a killer Non typical Jason.Them midwest and Canadian deer grow big.Not like those Texas runts with nothing but antlers. Joe
3261,Motorhead,2006-11-21 14:23:00,163,With all these great deer shots I thought I`d add mine from a couple of weeks ago..  Here you go.......  enjoy and thanks for looking    Doug

3376,Fishnfiend,2006-11-21 17:55:00,357,"Awesome deer guys! Hopefully, I will have a picture to add to this collection soon.  Praying for snow, like other bow hunters..."
3380,Kirk,2006-11-21 18:03:00,347,"Just read oxcowboys post/pic...and man, I respect the deer and the guy that got it...if it were me, I'm afraid I might be clicking away with the camera and looking for a new religion.  Amish are admirable people."
3385,wuchikubo,2006-11-21 18:09:00,1114,Gee it must be getting close to Christmas with all of you putting up the tree ornaments! LOL  Nice Pics!
