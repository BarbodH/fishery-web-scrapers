3046,Spiel,2006-11-21 01:41:00,9065,"....I've been in the market for some electric riggers for the new boat. I've been leaning towards the Big Jon Captains Pak (electric) and have been slow to purchase due to financial constraints. Well a long time friend of mine who happen to come across a pair of used ones (minimal use, one season) and has been sitting on them for some time finally relented and sold them to me. This gentleman has bought in the neighbourhood of some 50 custom rods off me over the last three decades, often at great bargain prices and agreed to let me have these riggers at cost to him. These two riggers are complete with dual rod holders, 4 foot booms, swivel bases, mounting plates and assorted stainless hardware. I think I got a deal at $600.00, what do you think?     "
3050,cisco,2006-11-21 01:46:00,597,"Quit braggin ya dude!!!  Seriously, great deal. A coupla years ago I got 2 used ones with short booms, raised towers and swivel bases without rod holders for $550. I was very happy with that deal! You done good son!"
3053,Daplumma,2006-11-21 01:48:00,1961,Sounds like a sweet deal Chris.Exactly what are those things?Electric fishing rods? Joe
3054,irishfield,2006-11-21 01:48:00,26272,Great stuff Bud! The only thing that always amazes me with Big Jon though is that darn 110Volt plug they use for their riggers. Surely by now some dumm.... has plugged them into the wall at home to see if they work! LOL  You gonna drill holes in your gunnels or pick up the Lund Rigger mounts that fit your Sport trac and outboard track for cover?
3057,danc,2006-11-21 02:00:00,4677,Sweet deal Chris. I know a nice little lake where those would come in handy next September or so..
3059,Spiel,2006-11-21 02:01:00,9065,"....A little bragging is okay for a fishless fisherman, isn't it Cisco?  Ah yes Joe, electric fishing rods?  I was thinking of using the sport trac rigger mounting brackets Wayne but I've heard pros and cons. Think I'll order a pair and decide on their worth. As for those plugs, yeah I've heard of guys trying them in a 110 circuit, Duh! I will be changing those plugs to a simple two pole connector.  Dan, Jef and I have already discussed that."
3065,Whopper,2006-11-21 02:06:00,2174,"I wonder the same thing when I looked at that. I was on a fishing boat in Florida once and they had electric reels on some of the rods with the same plugs and I wondered the same thing then,  Whopper"
3076,cisco,2006-11-21 02:17:00,597,I think the built-in circuit beaker button thingees are also there for when guys plug into wall sockets! LOL!!
3081,irishfield,2006-11-21 02:23:00,26272, That won't save them from 120v AC Chris! Just find it odd Big Jon stil uses the cheap lamp cord they started with back in the early days...like when these were made...  
3121,fishdawg,2006-11-21 03:17:00,912,That is a good deal there Chris do I have feeling your gonna give the salmon a go next year?
3160,Spiel,2006-11-21 04:09:00,9065,  ....I used to do a whole lot of salmon/trout rigging on the big lake Mark and noiw that I have a worthy boat of my own I'd like to get back into it. Perhaps we can hook up in the spring and test out these new riggers.
3171,moemoe,2006-11-21 05:06:00,352,Beauty set up! Looking for something similar myself except manual!
3199,fishdawg,2006-11-21 09:27:00,912,"  just say ""when"""
3207,Chuck Best,2006-11-21 11:12:00,308,"I'd have to say ,I think you got a good deal there Chris......."
3208,misfish,2006-11-21 11:30:00,29133,"As long as the motors are in good shape,you got one hell of a deal Chris.  Nice find."
3235,Sherriff,2006-11-21 13:30:00,252,"Nice buy Spiel!!  Wayne, those are classics!  Sherriff"
3236,Squid,2006-11-21 13:34:00,1656,I'd say its a deal. I believe that they go for 700 bucks each brand new.
3270,SHAD,2006-11-21 14:37:00,134,"Looks like a good deal dude but, ummm, does your Lund get wet, LOL, ** jk **"
3272,snackpack5150,2006-11-21 14:45:00,79,  Good deal for you....nice to know some people out there are willing to pass on a deal and not trying to squeeze every cent out of you!!!  One turn desevers another   Ken
3277,fishindevil,2006-11-21 14:50:00,6254,"you got the beast deal ever just the mounting swivel plates are worth 130.00$ each,i will give you 500$ for all that in a second"
3284,TEP,2006-11-21 15:04:00,68,"FW sells them for $750 each. Plus the swivel bases, plus the mounting plates. Sweet deal Mr. Spiel. We'll put 'em to use next season, but September can't get here fast enough! Ready to give it another go Dan?"
3306,wilker,2006-11-21 15:52:00,6,You got a great deal there Chis. I have the same thing on my boat for about  ten years now an they work great with no problems. good fishing.
3315,Seahag,2006-11-21 16:21:00,19,Mine are identical and came with my boat this past September. You did great as i researched the pricing before purchasing my boat.  you saved a couple of hundy for sure.
3526,aplumma,2006-11-21 22:38:00,6896,Great now that you spent the $$$ on the down riggers it will be even longer before you can afford to adopt me. I am starting to get the crazy idea that you might be trying to delay that fateful day.  1/2RF
3527,danc,2006-11-21 22:41:00,4677,  I'm counting the days Jef...
