3154,ccmtcanada,2006-11-21 03:50:00,7971," Some ppl think it's important...it takes work and time to post and keep up on here.  That and every guy likes to say ""mine's bigger than yours""    hehe"
3175,BabyHerc,2006-11-21 05:18:00,285,"I think post counts do more harm than good.  Low posters are brushed off, high posters are hailed as royalty.  Both have good and bad advice at one time or another.  Can I have a permanent one-post count?"
