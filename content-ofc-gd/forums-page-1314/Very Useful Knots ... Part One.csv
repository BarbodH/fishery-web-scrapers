Draw knots as tight as possible. 4. Trim tag ends close to the knot. =====================================================================  Albright Special Knot The Albright Knot is one of the most reliable connections for joining lines of greatly unequal diameters or different materials (including mono to braided or single strand wire). It is easy to tie and should be in everyoneâ€™s arsenal of knots.   Arbor Knot An easy to tie method of securing the end of the line to the arbor of the fishing reel.   Big Bight Knot Another end loop can be tied quickly and easily using the Blood Bight Knot.  Double the line back to make a loop of the size desired. Bring the end of the loop twice over the doubled part. Now pass the end of the loop through the first loop formed in the doubled part. Draw the knot up into shape, keeping pressure on both lines. The Blood Bight Knot is often used for attaching a dropper when fishing deep water with several hooks.  Some anglers attached the hook directly to the end of the loop, which should be at least 30cm from the end of the line.  This is not a good practice, especially when the fish are shy. Far better to attach a single strand of nylon to a short Blood Bight Knot, using another Blood Bight Knot, or a Surgeon's Knot.   Blood Knot Use this knot to join sections of leader or line together. It works best with lines of approximately equal diameter.   Berkley Braided Knot   Double Turle Knot Tied in monofilament nylon, the Turle Knot may slip unless another Simple Overhand Knot is made at the end of the line where it leaves the Turle Knot.  It is improved substantially by using the Double Turle Knot.  Pass the line through the eye of the hook or swivel. Make two simple loops, and carry the line on to make a Simple Overhand Knot around both loops. Pass both of these loops over the hook or swivel. Pull on both parts of the line to draw the knot up into shape against the eye of the hook or swivel.   Double Uni Knot (Line to Line Uni) The best knot for joining together two fishing lines of approximately the same diameter. This knot can be used with braided lines. If you find the Blood Knot cumbersome to tie, try the Double Uni - it doesn't get any easier than this!   Dropper Loop This knot forms a loop anywhere on a line. Hooks or other tackle can then be attached to the loop. "

3626,Dabluz,2006-11-22 01:48:00,701,"I've been using the uni-to-uni knot for the past few years and it has bee superior to the blood knot.  The perfection loop is a good knot to learn but it is quite weak.  The dropper loop is about the handiest knot a fisherman can use but it does weaken the line a bit.  For fly fishermen, the best and the strongest knot is the little known George Harvey Knot.  It's way stronger than the turle knot, way easier to tie and it's even smaller than the turle knot.  However, when you want to retie your fly, you have to use nail clippers to free the knot from the fly.  You can find the George Harvey knot on the internet.  For the past 10 years or so, I have been using eyeless bait hooks that I buy in Europe.  VMC makes a great hook.  They are incredibly sharp, fine and light yet stiff and strong....but expensive.  There are a variety of snell knots that work equally well with these hooks."
