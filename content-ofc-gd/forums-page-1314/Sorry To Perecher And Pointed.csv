3213,BITEME,2006-11-21 12:29:00,1969,Just to let you know i will post the BOQ pics and report sometime today I spent the day at Oakville hospital yesterday apparently I tried to pass a Kidney stone yesterday this happened at o700 yesterday and i'm just waking up and at work now  PLEASE STANDBY EXPERANCING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES PETER
3215,Corey,2006-11-21 12:42:00,355,"ya man, kidney stones suck. I have had surgery twice to remove them. First set was 1 weighing in at just over an inch in diameter with a 1/4 inch kicker and the second time was for a set of triplets at 1/2 inch each. Kinda weird that they didn't show up until I was 27 and then got the second set within 2 years of the first surgery.  My doctor and I figured out what the probable cause was of mine, iced tea and other assorted tea's... very high in oxylates, very bad for production of kidney stones. Goto www.kidney.org and look at the dietary stuff for kidney stones. You will really be doing yourself a favour if you keep some of the restricted foods in mind when shopping for groceries.  For someone who has been there a few times, kidney stones suck.  Corey"
3216,BITEME,2006-11-21 12:44:00,1969,That sucks im a huge tea drinker

3243,PERCHER,2006-11-21 13:46:00,787,"Made out really well with a total of 11 fish.The biggest being 14 lbs.But Mike couldnt make it,He missed out this time."

3258,knotaclue,2006-11-21 14:12:00,136,"I'm glad you did well,theres always another day, we'll have to plan some ice trips this year even if it's half days ??"
3266,Joey,2006-11-21 14:34:00,9122,Well that's crappy news Pete.  I bet you thought the pain was from all the swilling you did eh  Hopy you feel better soon.  And that does suck about the tea thing.  That's what I drink now  Joey
3278,BITEME,2006-11-21 14:51:00,1969,Joey i dont know what your talking about  did you come with the cooler and if you did where can i get one
3338,PERCHER,2006-11-21 17:09:00,787,Terry you are welcome .Any time you are always welcome in my boat.Dan
3353,Chris,2006-11-21 17:29:00,405,"Hey BITEME you have my sympathies, not fun to have an attack.   Just got a stone blasted out this summer. Hopefully they blast yours out rather than surgery, much less recuperation time. Good luck, man."
3497,Corey,2006-11-21 21:55:00,355,"Hey... sorry to hijack the thread, but ChrisS... you went to the lithotriptor? Which city did you have it done at? And how was it? My first stone removal was a tube in through the back into the kidney and a dentist drill to bust em apart, 10 day hospital stay, the second was laser up the you-know-what, out of the hospital same day, but had a stent in there for a week after. Only one I haven't had is shockwave..."
3502,aplumma,2006-11-21 22:06:00,6896,The good news is that if you drink the 8 glasses of water everyday you are less likly to get stones. Cranberry juice and lemonaide are also on the yes yes list. The bad news is all dark cola's are high in ocxcilates and will make stones if you drink to many of them. Sadly I had to cut back from 6 to 1 a day. The funny thing is my brother drinks beer and I dont but he has never had a kidney stone could it be that beer helps flushout the kidneys and keeps them from producing stones?????  Art
3504,irishfield,2006-11-21 22:11:00,26272,Art...break the Pepsi back out...I asked my Doctor and friend exactly what you speak shortly after Lakair last year. He told me in his opinion dark pop had FAR less to do with stones than genetics. Maybe Joe's stones shatter when he runs those darn 5 miles every day. Maybe you should run along beside him...on foot...not the tractor for a change! LOL
3509,Corey,2006-11-21 22:16:00,355," Cranberry is on the very NO NO list... it's as high in oxylate concentration as Tea is. Cola's and other dark pops should not be drank at all. Phosphoric Acid is the thing to be avoided in dark drinks such as cola's.  Beer is actually quite good for the kidney's, or should I say the barley is... Cranberry's are good for the urinary tract, but bad for creating stones.  I drink at least 2 litres of water daily, and usually another 2 litres of gatorade and then a few coffees on top of it all. Pee like crazy but (knock on wood) it's working, as far as I know.  To shoot off on yet another tangent, on my last CT we noticed I have a 1.5mm stone in my prostate, but apparently that's common and nothing to be concerned about. eeks."
3523,danc,2006-11-21 22:36:00,4677,  PHEW!!! I was just speed reading through this thread and I thought that you were still talking about kidney stones.  Get well soon BITEME..
