2513,tinbanger,2006-11-20 03:13:00,1028,"Dropped the boys off at the Barrie Marina for an afternoon of fun while Dad had some chores to do.  Apparently the day started off pretty quiet , the boys moved from dock to dock untill they finally found some decent action. Things were moving along as planned with one out of every 10 fish or so a keeper.  Shortly before the day ended my youngest cast out his rig just when a seagull flew by a few feet away ... you guessed it the 4lb test wrapped around the bird as it struggled to gain altitude.Apparently when Pikeie looked over thinking his brother had a fish on the rod bent back over his shoulder. Pikeie grabbed the line as the bird was headed for shore tugged the linen and knocking the bird into the water. Of course the bird was in a bit of a panic , trying to fly , catching the line on the dock , splashing like crazy. All the commotion drew quite a bit of attention from bystanders not to mention a few laughs.  Finaly the bird freed its self and flew off.  Quite a storey and a testiment to 4 lb mono that didn't snap.  Tinbanger"
3372,jason27fish,2006-11-21 17:46:00,90,no thats a crazy catch. Never done that before
3377,ccmtcanada,2006-11-21 17:56:00,7971,"Cant say that's ever happened to me, but it kind of reminds me of Dave Winfield hitting one with a baseball....."
3378,wuchikubo,2006-11-21 18:01:00,1114,"Been there, done that, good thing the CO or Game Warden wasn't around else they would have had him cut the line off."
3381,Terry,2006-11-21 18:03:00,14456,been there ..done that  once you reel them in it's hard to get the hook out of their bill and don't try to lip them I ended up cutting the line cause I just couldn't stop it from flopping around
3471,tinbanger,2006-11-21 21:02:00,1028,"apparently the whole episode only lasted less than a minute ,most likly a lot less as time you tend to lose track of time when theres a pi##ed off bird on the end of your line  .  Luckily the gull didn't get hooked"
3630,dheitzner,2006-11-22 01:57:00,314,that is hillarious - the same thing happened to me on the niagara river this weekend.  a tearn went for my roe sac on the cast and got tangled up in my line.  happy to say that it was landed & released to fly another day!
3662,Hooked,2006-11-22 02:41:00,891,"Yeah, thats crazy.  Just the other day, one of those black and white ducks fly into my line.  Man, I was glad he didn't pull enough to get the lure up to him.  After landing in the water, shaking his head a few times, off he went."
3666,mason05,2006-11-22 02:50:00,258,Wait till P3TA reads this thread!    Do they care about seaguls? LOL  Great story tinbanger
3671,Rizzo,2006-11-22 02:58:00,4754,"nuts, thought that story was going to finish with a big pike picking it off the surface"
3689,Jonaton,2006-11-22 03:07:00,72,My friend and I were fishing the harbourfront last weekend when a seagull dive bombed his x rap and took off with it. The seagull was released unharmed.
3715,Rizzo,2006-11-22 03:49:00,4754,too bad
3726,ehg,2006-11-22 04:18:00,2666,Had a gull attack my topwater last summer. Didn't get hooked but tangled in the line. Little bugger pecked me a bunch before it was released.
