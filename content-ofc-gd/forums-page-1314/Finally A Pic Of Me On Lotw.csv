It's a pic of me on LOTW somewhere on the N/E angle of the lake (sorry but I won't mention what bay, gotta keep some secrets). Needless to say, we caught probably about 30-35 smallies on crankbaits and spinners in about 3 hours (3 of us on the boat, 2 wanted wally's but had a blast catching the smallies). It's REALLY gorgeous up there and I'd highly recommend it. I know of a couple of good lodges up there too that were lauded by some of our southern neighbours we met out on the lake for those looking for a place to stay. "
