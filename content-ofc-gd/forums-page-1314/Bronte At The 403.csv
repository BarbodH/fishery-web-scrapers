There is construction on the south side of QEW and guys used to walk down there from the car pool parking lot. You can still park there, walk across Bronte and slip past the fence by the gas station. You can't walk down the construction road.  Petro Can park closed this week so access to this area is pretty limited for parking. Nothing to the south part of the river. It's all posted pretty much now. Used to park in the church beside the park entrance and walk down but they posted that too."
