3681,DMASSE,2006-11-22 03:04:00,420,"YA fishing today was flawless, it didnt matter on what to throw at them,   The water was atleast 2 feet higher abd the water was still clear...   Cool Day"
3687,The Urban Fisherman,2006-11-22 03:06:00,2050,wow -what more can I say?
3711,madtekniques,2006-11-22 03:33:00,15,Great job!  I was out today with very little luck probably due to the gin clear conditions where I was.  We spotted a ton of fish but they wouldn't take anything we threw at them.
3719,Beats,2006-11-22 03:54:00,543,"Nice going with all those fish!  Though, if I can make a suggestion... Don't post your pics with the name of the location in the filename..."
3765,b2kptbo,2006-11-22 12:19:00,1505,Nice...
3771,wishn4fishn,2006-11-22 12:38:00,108,"sweet Jesus, Hallelujah.  Good timing on that river.  It's just one of those days where you almost get bored of catching steel, you must of sprinkled crack in your roe bags.  Great Report!!!"
3799,DMASSE,2006-11-22 14:08:00,420,"CRACK ROE LOL  no just salmon and rainbow roe,  SHH the secret is mashed garlic in the bottom of the jar so the roe smells good enought to eat...  actually small worm from my local pet store worked well.....  BEAT  yhanks for the advice I didnt reliaze that I posted the name as well...  Dave"
3801,ccmtcanada,2006-11-22 14:11:00,7971,17 for 23?? Oh man...I haven't caught that many fish this YEAR!!! LOL  Great job!
3803,TroutSlayer,2006-11-22 14:15:00,64,Very nice catch pal!  Congrats! I can't imagine the water in those shots above being normally 2 feet lower than what I see!
3804,DMASSE,2006-11-22 14:18:00,420,"YA it look decieving but the water was high for this time of year,  But i did notice that the pools seemed deeper, than usual...  maybe the faster water over the time made them deeper..."
