2749,OhioFisherman,2006-11-20 17:37:00,6623,"My computer has a problem and I can`t seem to get it figured out. I have been on the phone with my DSL provider, Best Buy, Compac and no one has given me an answer that fixes it.  I have no sound other than a beep every once in a while, no voice sounds, no music, I have looked and it`s telling me everything is working. I also have a delay as I am typing, sometimes it take 10 seconds for the new words to appear. I have done a recovery a couple times and a F-10 restore and nothing seems to make a difference.  My DSL provider sent me a new DSL modem package, should I install it? Does it sound like a modem problem?  LOL Thanks!"
2753,bigfish1965,2006-11-20 17:42:00,3382,"Sounds more like a resource problem. Something must be sucking up too much CPU resources. Right click on the blue toolbar at the bottom or your screen and from that select Task Manager. Click on 'Processes' and look for a big number in there (like more than 50,000). IF there is something big running twice (other than svchost) do a Google search on it. Just enter the name of the process (something.exe) in Google and see what you find. SOmetimes your browser will hang and not close properly and while it appears there is only one open, there is another running...big resource loss there. IF nothing is running twice, start googling from the biggest number to the smallest to see if you have a virus in there."
2758,dsn,2006-11-20 17:47:00,1018,I don't think its modem problem. I'm on DSL also with Sympatico. If its Sympatico you're with forget. I never got an good info from them when it comes to tech supoort. Try testing you comuter with PC Doctor. PC Doctor helps test variuos parts of the computer. I'n not much of a hardware person but more knowledge of a software.  Sure someone here can hep you. I think I saw a post back where some one had the same problem. dsn
2767,dsn,2006-11-20 17:58:00,1018,Here's the other thread about sound problem. http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=253
2918,Corey,2006-11-20 22:14:00,355,"Do a google search for ""hijack this"", download it, run it and post a log from it here, or pm me the log it generates.  A little more background on the situation would help. When did the problems start happening? Did you do anything at that time like new software/hardware? As well, make sure that you have the pseakers plugged into the right jack, generally the green one. You should also check in the control panel under 'Sounds and Audio Devices', make sure the volume is up and it's not muted. The beeps can be attributed to the system speaker inside the machine, which leaves a good possibility that there is an issue with the sound card or settings.  The system hanging could be something as simple as a virus definition update, or scan. It could also be some type of anti spyware issue, Windows Defender/MS Antispyware is classic for that. Either way, I would guess you have 2 seperate problems, so double/triple check the sound settings and connections, try different speakers or headphones too, make sure the speakers aren't shot.  Post that Hijack This log and we'll figure out what the system lag problem is.  Corey"
3780,OhioFisherman,2006-11-22 13:10:00,6623,"Thanks guys, it`s been a pain for about 3 weeks. My speakers are built into my monitor and I do get a beep if I  click on the wrong item, just no other sounds. I get a message that says ""supported sound card cannot be found"" if I try to play a game like Holye casino, I have re-installed the game and no help.  The computer is saying everything is connected and working. Mute is off volume is up.  I also get a message archlib.dll needs to be re-installed, and svchost.exe is the only thing using resources on the task manager besides FireFox in any amount.  No clue it`s still under a service plan but I have no idea if it is a hardware or software issue. I will run Hijack this and post the log."

4011,Corey,2006-11-22 22:02:00,355," Not to be rude, but the described issues are in no way, shape or form symptoms of a failing hard drive. Recommending someone download software that runs on a continual basis like HD Heartbeat does, accomplish's nothing more than slowing down a computer that much more with no hope of resolving the issues at hand.  Don't install HD Heartbeat. Make sure that SMART is enabled in the BIOS and leave it at that. Your computer will tell you when the hard drive is failing without the added bloatware."
