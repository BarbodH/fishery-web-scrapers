2391,silveradosheriff,2006-11-19 23:18:00,1025,"Background: My brother in law made this boat about 15 years ago and has since moved out east. I 'inherited' this fine vessel and have ran it with a 4.5hp on the back. Needs some TLC - it does take some water at the top seam but not too concerning. If anyone wants it, it is yours for free - otherwise it is headed towards the landfill.  PM or email for any other details.  It is about 7' by 3.5'.  SS.  e:[emailÂ protected]  "
2462,BLACKFISH88,2006-11-20 01:17:00,191,where do you live i would take it if you were close enough
2468,silveradosheriff,2006-11-20 01:30:00,1025,"Boat is located in Cambridge, will meet within 30 minutes or so."
2477,oxcowboy,2006-11-20 01:54:00,544,"great of you to offer up the boat,  i dont need it, but it would make a greater starter boat for someone who is just getting into the sport, or someone on a tight budget.   very nice of you. jason"

2791,Sherriff,2006-11-20 18:53:00,252,When we going out Corn Nug?  Sherriff
2801,mason05,2006-11-20 19:07:00,258,"Sherriff, We'll head out as soon as I give her a little TLC.  Thought it would be perfect for some of the conservation waters around that don't allow gas motors.  Mountsberg, Valens, etc.  Plus it will make for a little winter project.  Thanks again SS!  Now I just need a trolling motor and battery."
3037,silveradosheriff,2006-11-21 01:22:00,1025,Thanks Tinbanger- I ways comtemplating straping a couple giant trebles on it and doing some topwater trolling!  :-)

3625,mason05,2006-11-22 01:47:00,258,"Like I said lads, a little TLC and she'll be perfect for smaller bodies of water that don't allow gas motors.  Reports to follow.....it's not the size of the vessel it's how you use it.  LOL"
3861,Kirk,2006-11-22 15:55:00,347,I think that's the first boat I have seen that will double in value once you buy a lifejacket to put in it...LOL
