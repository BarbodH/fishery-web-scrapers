1016728,misfish,2017-11-01 22:43:00,29133,It was way down this summer. Visited the lake 3 times . Sad state it is in.
1016766,msp,2017-11-02 16:31:00,1336,not sure the status of the lake levels now. Buddy took out his lower unit on a 21 ft Triton this summer. Not good. can be a very dangerous lake

1016793,jimmer,2017-11-02 20:29:00,2730,Most of the kawartha levels are down at this time of the year. I was on that lake once and it scared the heck out of me.

1016805,Acountdeleted,2017-11-02 22:12:00,2562,We have a cottage on the lake. It's been a wreck ever since the dam was taken out. Fall the water levels are dangerous. Low water levels killed pretty much all the walleye. It's been a real mess for a while now. Makes me sad.
1016807,JohnnyS,2017-11-02 22:36:00,13,Thanks for the replies.  I may take a chance next week.
