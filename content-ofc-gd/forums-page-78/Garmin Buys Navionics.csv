1016412,DRIFTER_016,2017-10-27 15:46:00,10439,"https://www.garmin.com/en-US/blog/fishandhunt/garmin-acquires-navionics-marine-charts/    Garmin is proud to announce that it has acquired Navionics S.p.A., a privately-held worldwide provider of electronic navigational charts and mobile applications for the marine industry.  Navionics has long been known as a leading supplier of highly accurate navigational charts and mobile applications for boaters. By combining Navionics’ content with Garmin’s BlueChart and LakeVü content, we will be able to offer the best available breadth and depth of coverage to our marine customers. Going forward, we plan to retain the Navionics brand and will continue to support Navionics’ existing customers.  “Since our founding, Navionics has been passionate about creating products that enhance the boating experience,” said Giuseppe Carnevali, Navionics founder and president. “Garmin shares our passion for serving the marine industry, and is an ideal company to carry the strong brand and reputation of Navionics into the future.”  In addition to a popular boating app, Navionics has developed an extensive repository of nautical charts for oceans, rivers, and lakes. Many of these charts have been developed with Navionics’ proprietary surveys, done both in the field and with remote sensing such as satellite imagery and airborne laser scanners.  "

1016568,KraTToR,2017-10-30 14:14:00,506,"I'm sure someone will speak up on this with more detail but my information states that the Canadian charts are owned by a 3rd party and navionics is the only one with permission to use them.  That's why HB charts cut off at the border.  This should be available to everyone, how we got cornered into this one i'll never know."
1016569,Dutch01,2017-10-30 14:30:00,1431,"AFAIK, any hydrographic/bathymetric data held by the government is available to anyone. Many lakes are charted but not all. So if a private company graphed a previously uncharted lake, it would be up to them what they did with that data."
