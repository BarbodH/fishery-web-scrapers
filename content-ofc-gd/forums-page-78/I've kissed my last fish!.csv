1015837,Terry,2017-10-18 15:14:00,14456,Well. I have been known to kiss a fish But never open mouth kiss or French kiss Thats so wrong So a friendly closed mouth kisss is still fine
1015848,DRIFTER_016,2017-10-18 16:29:00,10439,If you guys want to get parasites be my guest and kiss all the fish you want. My buddy in Alaska decided to kiss a hooligan (like a saltwater smelt thing) and ended up in hospital with parasites. Lost nearly 20#'s during the ordeal.  Every time I watch Cyril kiss a fish I wonder why he isn't dead yet!!! Kissing Amazonian or tropical fish is the absolute dumbest thing on the planet!!!
1015858,JoePa,2017-10-18 18:27:00,179,There is a TV program that comes on once a week down here - it's called Monsters Inside Me - it tells true stories of people getting parasites various ways - boy when you watch that program it scares the hell out of you - a lot of people get very sick and almost die and a lot of times the doctors don't know what is wrong with you until everything else has been tried and tested - what I've learned is to wash your food - watch where you eat out - cook your food - keep your mouth closed when swimming - wash your hands - the one story was about a guy who ended up going blind in one eye because a worm was in his eye - it was a parasite that he picked at a horse show from eating from one of the vendors

Twice now I have gotten sick from fish slime.  First time I had some slime on my fingers holding a cig. Took a drag and the slime was on the butt. Sick for a week. Just this past winter, the same thing happen. As soon as I did it, I knew it was going to happen again. And sure as crap, I got sick.  I watched a vid of a member here letting his kid kiss fish. Put shivers up my spine."
1015996,Mister G,2017-10-20 16:16:00,1429,"I kiss fish all the time but that's after I retrieve them from the hot oil, before that is just plain stupid."
1016424,jimmer,2017-10-27 19:20:00,2730,"That fish looked a little large to be going down that guys throat.  We all have to be diligent around fish, algae and weeds.  I'm pretty sure there was a local man who died about 15 years ago from an infection he contacted on Sturgeon Lake in the Kawarthas."
