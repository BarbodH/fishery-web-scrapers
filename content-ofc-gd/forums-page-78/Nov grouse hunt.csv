1017133,Canuck,2017-11-08 00:10:00,491,Nice. I haven't hunted grouse in many years.  When my Slovenian grandmother still lived up in Kirkland Lake she would make a fantastic grouse stew from the birds we got.  She would clean them faster than I could ever do it too.   I miss her.  And the stew.  And the rush you get from the first bird of the fall.
