Took the flow meter out and connected some hoses to it and blew some nitrogen through, no plug there. Installed it again and still no flow. Getting really frustrated now. Pulled the flow meter again, and then realized that I had not removed the valve cores from the 1/4"" flare fittings on the meter. Felt like an idiot. Took out the valve cores, put everything back together, and it worked just fine after that."
1016273,LostAnotherOne,2017-10-25 19:35:00,956,Great thread.  I was driving on the 403 when i noticed a small spider crawling on the inside of my front windshield.  I decided thats the end for you.  I used my palm and got him good.  Unfortunately i used too much force and ended cracking my windshield with two four inch cracks.  That little bugger cost me $300.
1016275,lew,2017-10-25 19:53:00,12766,the hood of that Edge flipped open on the road test; the hood is buckled at the hinges and the windshield is smashed.  43 years ago my wife and I rented a cottage on Pigeon Lake.  I was sitting at the beach one day reading the paper and there was a boat house there with a sundeck on top. A guy was up there with his wife and German Shepherd dog and he reached over and put his arm around the wife and I spose the dog thought he was hurting her so he attacked. He was getting some nasty bites so to get away from the dog he dove head first off the roof but instead of landing in the water he landed head 1st in a boat tied up at the dock.  I ran over and the poor guy was in tough shape both from the dog bites and the 8' header into the boat.  He asked me to take him to the hospital and said to take his car as it was faster so off we go across hwy 7 towards Lindsay about 70 MPH when the darned hood flies open and smashed the windshield and bashes in the the roof. Turns out it was one of those deals where pins go up thru the hood and are held in place with rings that he forgot to clip when he finished working on the engine last time. I got it part way closed and was able to get one pin in and off we go again. Get about another mile down the road and I notice it's over heating now. Dood says that happens all the time and I have to pull off the road again to get some coolant from the trunk.  Finally get this guy to the hospital where he gets a bazillion stitches plus patched up from the 8' dive and eventually  get him home hours later.  I never met this guy before but it made for a crazy day and is something I don't think I'll ever forget.

They actually asked him if he wanted the 4. Lexus knows all of the superstitions known to man. He told him not a problem with the 4. They never ate at home so him and his wife went to Bayview Village for dinner. At 10 pm he came out and the Lexus was gone!!!! it was dark and he figured he parked it somewhere farther, no luck. Called our finest and they went where he parked it and on the ground was the lock cylinder! Had to call Lexus and tell them a $125,000 car was tone, they never did find it!

So of course I was rubbing it in ALL week long. As the week wore on to everyones delight I started to lose jigs being bitten off by pike. Soon I only had one left. One morning all three boats of us are fishing a small current area where we had done well all week. But it was slow this morning so I announced that it was time to use my last secret weapon to show the boys how real fishermen do it. I cut my line and dig out my last magic jig and tie it on...then throw it over the side of the boat to get going and realize I had just retied the jig I took off and threw my magical jig untied into the lake  Never got any sympathy from my buddies either....actually quite the opposite.

Inside these units there's a pretensioner; that pulls the seat belt back tight against you, when an air bag is deployed. When these pretensioners go off, they sound like a shotgun blast. So I clamp the retractor in the bench vice and connected a couple of jumper wires to a battery; leaving one jumper clip off. I turned my back to the bench and called the coop kid over to help me with something. While I wasn't looking one of the guys sneaked up to the bench and connects the last jumper lead. Bang off goes the tensioner; me and the kid hit the floor, on top of each-other. After I get up and check my pants for foreign objects; I see both my techs standing at the bay door laughing and ready to run. LOL  Then there is the acetylene bombs; that we'd connect to a spark plug wire and close the hood. Had a buddies car in for a hard starting issue; fix the problem and then installed one of the bombs.

I was moving things around in the basement storage so that I could get to my ice fishing gear. I put my minnow trap on top of a box but it fell onto one of my marine batteries.

After a minute or 2 of panic I was able to pry the minnow trap off because it was stuck to the battery.

On one trip I was taking my son out with me; planning the trip was lots of fun: what should we use 12 G or 20 G. Since we were going for pheasant and grouse we decided on the 20s. We packed a nice lunch, loaded up the car: guns, check: amo, check: dog, check: and away we went. It was only a couple of hours drive which gave us time to have our coffee and plan our day.  The trip was beautiful, we got to our destination and the sun was just coming up, it was going to be a perfect day. I let the dog out to stretch while we were getting our gear on and within a minute there was Andy on point at the edge of the parking lot. I told Clifford to grab his gun and go bag the first bird of the day.  That's when the fun started, Clifford uncased his gun and pulled out his 20 gauge, opened the amo box and found out we had brought the box with 12 gauge shells instead of the one with the 20 gauge shells. Poor Andy couldn't understand why I would take him off a perfectly good solid point and not even try to shoot that bird.

I proceed to turn on the new motor and it won't work for some reason?? A few hours of troubleshooting everything and I still couldn't figure it out? All the while I'm talking to my buddy about how I am going to buy a hole saw attachment tomorrow to cut a hole for a new latch to create a new hatch up front to better fit my new 24v two battery configuration. I still could not get the new TM to work for some reason however? Lots of troubleshooting later, while on the phone with minnkota they ask me to just double check the sticker underneath the motor to ensure it was a 24v. ""I'm sure it is the model you state, however let's just double check to be certain"". Had a massive OH SH#$ moment when I read the sticker and kindly thanked them for their time and hung up. Turns out the new motor I installed was still a 55lber, not the 80lb 24V as advertised. 1K, two new batteries,new TM plug installed, 24V wiring and 6 hours later, I had basically installed the same power TM I had just uninstalled and almost cut holes in my floor.

The hoist he was using will let an open hood of a vehicle touch the ceiling rafters; so he genitally lowered the hood.  Well he forgot the hood wasn't latched not even on the safety and took it for a road test. When he got back he sheepishly walked into my office.  Ah Dan the hood of that Edge flipped open on the road test; the hood is buckled at the hinges and the windshield is smashed. What do you want me to do. I said nothing right now, I'll call the customer and explain. Tonight after work, you come to my house. That night he shows up at my house. I had a rib-eye steak supper with all the fixings ready for us. We sat and talked about what happened and turned it into a good night and to think of things NOT to do at work. LOL Customer got the Ford fixed; I shelled out about $2500.00 for paint & body and he (Dave) is still my best employee. OK maybe not so funny a story to tell; but if you were at my house that night you'd understand how Dave thought he was getting his walking papers, instead of a great meal and a few laughs. The look on his face was priceless; like a puppy dog that knows something is wrong.  Dan."

My junior employee has only been with me for 16 years They both started with me as apprentices and haven't wanted to move on? Now that's funny if you knew what kind of prick I can be, LOL  Dan."
