1017057,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-07 00:40:00,8243,Exactly Grimsby. I've limited out more than a few times. I wonder if they have a pro tour? We used to fish Smallies 40 years back up on the Maitland River. We Microfished (new word for dictionary) for bait with an ice rod and a small bit of worm. That was before I ever heard of a dip net.
