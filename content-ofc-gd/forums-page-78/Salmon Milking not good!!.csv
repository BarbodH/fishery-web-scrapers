1016247,Terry,2017-10-25 14:58:00,14456,"I read as far as they dont like to see dead salmon all along the river and the smell, so it needs to stop Yeah. That will stop dead salmon along the river  and clean the smell right up"
1016251,John Bacon,2017-10-25 15:26:00,3277,"Re: '""When you look, there's dead salmon everywhere. There's just dead fish everywhere. It was horrible.""'All of the salmon are going to die.  Killing some for the eggs doesn't actually increase the number of dead salmon in the rivers.  I am not saying that it is okay to slit them open and leave them there, just that there will be just as many dead salmon along the river whether or not the practice continues."
1016253,SirCranksalot,2017-10-25 15:47:00,3291,"If they die in the river they will stay in the river or get washed out to the lake, not lie around on the bank stinking the place up."
1016254,DRIFTER_016,2017-10-25 15:52:00,10439,"If they die in the river they will stay in the river or get washed out to the lake, not lie around on the bank stinking the place up.  As long as the river level doesn't go up or down. I spend a lot of time fishing in Alaska and guess what, there are dead salmon everywhere!!!! It's 10,000 times worse than the Credit or any other GL river could ever be."
1016256,Terry,2017-10-25 16:36:00,14456,"i thought they were talking about people  who milk them and release them and they end up dying because they were out of the water too long, not that they were gutting and leaving them where they cut them so if they release them they would end up the same as if they spawned"

1016388,John Bacon,2017-10-27 03:14:00,3277,"  Yeah, fair point but the next rainstorm should flush them out.  Doesn't work that way.  Some will wash out, some will be deposited on land.  Many of the rivers in BC receive 90% of their nutrients from the dead salmon.  This wouldn't happen if they got washed out every time in rained."
