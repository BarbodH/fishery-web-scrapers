1016274,glen,2017-10-25 19:42:00,2641,Heard on the radio Cabelas BARRIE is having 20% off everything in store on the weekend.  Only heard the ad once so I hope thats the correct info
1016288,Fisherman,2017-10-25 20:54:00,7201,"Hmm, nothing on their website either."
1016289,misfish,2017-10-25 20:57:00,29133,Nope  Just this  https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/CabelasCA/6b797402-97d2-4119-afcc-519f7e1ba634?wid=610&hei=45&resMode=sharp3  
1016292,Fisherman,2017-10-25 21:34:00,7201,Glen needs hearing aids...
1016293,Fisherman,2017-10-25 21:37:00,7201,Nope  Just this  https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/CabelasCA/6b797402-97d2-4119-afcc-519f7e1ba634?wid=610&hei=45&resMode=sharp3  Thinks that's the US site.
1016301,glen,2017-10-25 22:30:00,2641,Well I guess I will call the store to see if Im deaf.
1016308,Fisherman,2017-10-25 23:11:00,7201,"Well I guess I will call the store to see if Im deaf. Just pullin your ear,  I have to wear them otherwise I tend to tune out the other half."
1016309,misfish,2017-10-25 23:17:00,29133," Nope  Just this  https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/CabelasCA/6b797402-97d2-4119-afcc-519f7e1ba634?wid=610&hei=45&resMode=sharp3  Thinks that's the US site.    Really  I see the Canadian site and it,s there  https://www.cabelas.ca/"
1016310,irishfield,2017-10-25 23:53:00,26272,20% ALMOST gets them down to reality pricing...
1016311,Fisherman,2017-10-26 00:55:00,7201,"  Really  I see the Canadian site and it,s there  https://www.cabelas.ca/  Well what the ..cabelas.ca, yes, I have the shortcut to the Barrie store and makes no mention of it."
1016319,wkrp,2017-10-26 11:56:00,656,20% ALMOST gets them down to reality pricing... X2 on that
1016336,Terry,2017-10-26 15:45:00,14456,Heard it on the radio. They said up to 20% on everything  Big difference then 20% off everything
1016387,PUMP KNOWS,2017-10-27 02:51:00,937,20% off everything would've been perfect  I'll even take 15% off everything
1016403,Fisherman,2017-10-27 13:53:00,7201,"Well worth the trip, got around $45 off a pair of waders."
1016426,misfish,2017-10-27 20:24:00,29133,"Im starting to think it,s to clear out the Cabelas brand, to make room for the BPS brand. I sure hope the selection gets bigger. This store sucks for this.  EDIT to add  The BAIT BUCKET IS MY GO TO FOR MY RIVER SUPPLIES.  Tom has gone above and beyond to make this happen. And as pricing, he is very reasonable IMO."
1016429,glen,2017-10-27 20:31:00,2641,Fisherman says Im blind or did he say deaf but he didnt mind saving $45.  Your welcome.  Glad it was good info.
