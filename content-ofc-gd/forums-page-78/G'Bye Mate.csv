972173,ccmtcanada,2016-06-03 02:15:00,7971,"When I was new to fishing and this board,  even though he had a way of rubbing people the wrong way at times, he was always helpful and supportive of my relentless questions.  He taught me a lot about carp and steelhead.  And he always replied in my threads with encouragement.  Sad news.  I knew his health had been failing.  At least where he is now, those issues are gone.  Hope your fishing your dream spot up there Steve!"
972174,OhioFisherman,2016-06-03 02:25:00,6623,RIP Photoz!
972177,mikeh,2016-06-03 03:03:00,824,"I fished with Steve a few times, the first time we went carp fishing he was in one spot and I was 40' away, he was out fishing me 8 fish to 1 and I suggested we switch spots to see if I could at least make the fish caught close, after we switched spots he started catching fish where I was and I wasn't having much luck, he ended up out fishing me 13-1, he supplied all the bait , I figured it was his lucky day.  RIP Steve"
972213,Whopper,2016-06-03 14:53:00,2174,Sad news indeed.
972235,wormdunker,2016-06-03 16:05:00,1711,Sad to hear when we lose a member.  My condolences to his family & friends. RIP buddy!

972296,Rizzo,2016-06-03 22:16:00,4754,I was afraid that this is what this post was going to be about. He had a very unique style to be sure. My condolences to all who knew Steve personally
978370,Twilight1,2016-08-02 17:56:00,1,"I had been thinking about you Photoz and so came back to OFC to read a comment of yours or a post.....this was not the news I expected to see.  Photoz became my friend - a very true friend and somewhat of a protector.  He and I communicated every morning via email for 6 years.  I had taken a wrong turn and found myself yet again in a mess.  Photoz was there for me, would ask the hard questions which forced me to look and see the deception in my life, he taught me to be on guard, and above all he never once violated my trust.  And Photoz, I'll always remember the time we fished for carp together but mostly I will cherish our emails which show how much you cared for me.  My story with Photoz began the day he reached out to me in a private message in answer to a post I made on this site.  (Back then I was known as Chromehen and then Twilight.)  His message to me went something like this; ""What kind of idiot are you....can't you see you are being used!""  That pure honesty drew me to him and he remained my confidant and the truest person in my life when there was nothing pure and true about it - including myself.  Photoz, I know that the Lord brought us together in order that I would have firsthand experience in seeing that I wasn't so damaged that I could never trust.  Our friendship was only for a short season yet it was enough time for me to get back on my feet.   You were dependable, reliable and true....exactly the male example I needed.  Thank you for your patience because I have come to see how truly lost I was.  I will never forget you.  The Ultimate Straight Shooter has revealed all truth to you and so I have comfort knowing that you now see how much I did care for you and why I had to stop the emails.  Your no nonsense approach helped me to finally do what I had always wanted to - and that was to read the Bible.  I now know truth.  Thank you Photoz!  I hope I will see you again...I truly do."
1016721,glirw,2017-11-01 20:45:00,200,"Like many who have already written before me I too will miss Steve and will remember him for being a passionate fisherman and outdoorsman, a photographer, a fighter, and a friend.  Between '05 and '07 Steve and I exchanged close to 300 e-mails about everything from fishing to family life. He was among the first people that I'd met in person off these forums when I was a teenager just getting serious about fishing, and Steve (along with Ron from Peterborough) introduced me to Carp fishing. Him and I also went on dozens of trips together chasing Salmon in the Ganny (albeit with far fewer catches hah), trout (in Whitecastle, he loved to try for them there), perch on the ice (He always brought his Vexilar, I would freeze my ass off), and even white suckers in Beaverton. But of course his favorite fish to catch was Carp.  For some time Steve became something of a grandfather figure in my life, someone I could rant to freely about teenage woes, and someone who could ask me for help with their computer or email.  I know that he had persevered through multiple bouts of cancer through the years, but his spirit seemed to be indestructible the entire time I kept in touch with him. I'd always admired that about him. It's truly unfortunate that he did not get to enjoy his retirement years.  RIP old friend.    "

1016738,fishdawg,2017-11-01 23:53:00,912,Always sad when old original OFNrs pass on... Never knew him well but recall seeing him and his Caravan in some of the Simcoe parking lots during ice season.
1016824,bigbuck,2017-11-03 02:52:00,2449,RIP. Catch a biggun up there.
1016827,Moosebunk,2017-11-03 04:04:00,3970,One of the good guys here for sure... Always liked Photoz.  Condolences to family and friends.

972075,Beans,2016-06-02 15:08:00,3339,"  I got a phone call from one of my carpin' buddies (Ron in P'Boro) informing me that we lost a fellow carper and long time OFC member a few weeks ago...Photoz.  I'm sure some of you remember him...He got a kick out of ruffling a few feathers of some of the members but I loved his sense of humour...  He is responsible for getting some of us interested in carp fishing...I will always remember him inviting me up to behind the Canoe Club in P'Boro to see him use his new European style carp equipment for the first time...He had paid $1320 for it ( I remember paying less for old cars than that !)...it boggled my mind that anyone would pay that much just to catch carp (I used to use a hand line with a bell sinker on the end and a drop line baited with a cornmeal doughball when I fished for carp off the Scugog Causeway when I was a young lad)...His first cast looked like a Tiger Woods tee shot...  Steve liked to fish for most species of fish spring, summer, fall and winter but his poor health caught up to him and curtailed his activities greatly the past year or so (buggered up knee and Parkinson's disease)  My memories of carp fishing with him are the best...I will sure miss sitting around shooting the breeze waiting for the sound of one of our bite alarms go off...  Rest in Peace old friend"

He was always trying to talk me into going carp fishing with him and said once I tried it I'd never want to chase muskies again but his persuasions were never strong enough LOL  Always sad when we lose another good guy."
972079,misfish,2016-06-02 15:23:00,29133,"WOW, This is sad news. Steve was the straight shooter, and some couldn't take it.  RIP  BYE"

That man would take his last hook off his line and give it to you if he thought you needed it. I didn't get to see Steve much in the last two or three years but we often stayed in touch through email. I'll miss that crusty old bugger! RIP my friend!"
972084,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-02 15:46:00,8243,I am so sad to hear that news. Condolences to his family and many friends. I did enjoy his banter many times. I'm so sorry Beans for you and really all of our loss.
972085,crappieperchhunter,2016-06-02 15:53:00,2582,Jeez Beansie where we not just talking about him a month ago while chasing gills and crappie.  Used to get out with Steve a lot. He is solely responsible for getting me into carpin.  We have lost touch the last few years because of his health but like Cliff we still exchanged the odd email.  A great guy if you where lucky enough to get to know him.  RIP Photoz.
