1016541,jnic,2017-10-30 01:15:00,158,Hi all   looking for a good outfitter in Ontario or quebec with a chance at catching 20 plus pike. I am from the Ottawa area but would travel anywhere this side of thunder bay. any info would be greatly appreciated. thanks
1016544,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-30 02:44:00,8243,Klotz Lake Camp. Highway 11 way up there before Long Lac. Guaranteed if you know what you are doing. Fishing not catching.
1016553,scuro2,2017-10-30 05:00:00,904,20 plus pike...what size? There are places you can go that doesn't cost a lot where you could catch 20 small pike in an hour.
1016559,mark demmery,2017-10-30 12:02:00,68,"I think Mike Borger did some pike trips this year. Can't remember exact lakes, but might be worth a call or trip to his website...."
1016562,AKRISONER,2017-10-30 12:50:00,5558,i think he meant 20lb + pike...  Id fish georgian bay with a guide personally. No need for extreme expenses for that one.

Gbay is great, but it's nothing like the Attawapiskat or other similar flyin lodges on big river/water systems.    The first day up on North Caribou I think we put 5 or 6 in the boat over 40in.  You're not doing that on Gbay."

The northwest territories has some absolutely ridiculous monster pike fishing.  If you have a the budget for a fly in, do it!"
1016574,BillM,2017-10-30 14:43:00,17367,I'm sure there are some great drive to places in Quebec that have a lot of big snakes.
1016605,adempsey,2017-10-30 20:24:00,1498,"Mike Borger did a report on Lac Evans.  Looks like it could be a good choice. You should check out all Mikes reports.  Hearst Air Camps - Pym, Canada Outpost  Kesagami Lake from either the lodge or the outposts that have portages into the lake.  As Bill mentioned, North Caribou Camps flies out of Thunder Bay.  Place is pretty awesome.  Go in the spring."
1016610,DRIFTER_016,2017-10-30 20:39:00,10439,There's some good ones in the Attawapiskat too.  
1016612,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-30 20:50:00,8243,"Ya gotta love Photoshop eh Big Dave. Nice fish you have there. Same camo as you have, planned?"
1016615,DRIFTER_016,2017-10-30 21:02:00,10439,"Ya gotta love Photoshop eh Big Dave. Nice fish you have there. Same camo as you have, planned?  I don't even remember how many fish over 40"" Mike and I caught on this trip. I do remember we each had 45"" fish as our biggest of the week. This girl was caught on the fly rod too."
1016626,jnic,2017-10-31 01:18:00,158,"hi all thanks for the replies, ya did mean 20lb plus, flyin not out of the question budget around 1500 per guymax. we have been with Cochrane air 8 times. Just want to up the anti as life seems busy with kids and hockey and could be last kick at the can.   thanks jeff"
1016627,jnic,2017-10-31 01:19:00,158,anyone ever been to pasha cabins?
1016634,BillM,2017-10-31 05:54:00,17367,"hi all thanks for the replies, ya did mean 20lb plus, flyin not out of the question budget around 1500 per guymax. we have been with Cochrane air 8 times.

1016640,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-31 12:20:00,8243,"Definitely talk to Mike, he will not steer you wrong. When we used to go up to Klotz Lake the outfitter had 14' boats on back lakes in the area and you got to them driving the Kimberly Clark logging roads to specific mile markers. We would run into fishermen that paid for fly-ins only to find out you can drive in for many dollars less and not be confined to 1 lake only. Something to consider. Those Yanks were not too happy to see us. That is until they realized we would drop off a few cases of Beer, ice and munchies for them at the top of the hill, more than once. Could have made some nice easy money but couldn't do that to them."
1016652,TennesseeGuy,2017-10-31 16:57:00,957,"Best way to be put onto boating huge pike begins when a fishermen convinces others that he appreciates the resource and takes great care in catching, handling and releasing all fish."
1016663,chris.brock,2017-10-31 20:23:00,4053,Definitely talk to Mike.  Less than $1500 and east of Thunder Bay-  http://www.eddienorthadventures.ca/nakinaflyinfishingcamp.htm  http://www.leuenberger.ca/washi.html  http://www.ogokilakeoutfitters.com/  http://www.aircochrane.com/adventures/lakes/partridge-lake/  are ones I've been to  some I haven't Mike says are good for big pike-  http://www.outpostcamps.com/Nameigos  http://whiteriverair.com/outposts/south-garnham/
1016678,jnic,2017-10-31 23:53:00,158,thans all I have contacted mike
1016770,maker a laker,2017-11-02 17:29:00,33,"I've been to several of the places noted above, but never caught multiple 20lbers. Try Air Ivanhoe website. Foleyet area 1 hr southwest of Timmins. They have Rice Lake and Rush Lake outposts on big lakes, exclusively pike. They are at the Sportsmans Show every year. Talked with guys at the show who had caught 2-3 20lb pike in the same week at those camps. Flyin, remote, much closer than Geraldton/Nakina area lower cost than many other options listed. Good Luck"
1016776,BillM,2017-11-02 18:09:00,17367,Multiple 20lbs at a place like the Attawapiskat isn't very hard to achieve.    But you gotta pay to play.
