1016927,G.mech,2017-11-05 13:20:00,830,If you can't find one you can buy a download version for 13 bucks.  I've bought a few manuals for various toys from this site and they are the actual OEM shop service manual you can save on your 'puter.  https://www.readmanual.com/outboard.motors/johnson.evinrude/1993.Johnson.Evinrude.ET.90.LV.Service.Manual.PN.508287.htm
