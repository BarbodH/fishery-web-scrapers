1016722,Dutch01,2017-11-01 21:01:00,1431,Most new cars won't allow you to use cruise control without traction control on.  In winter I turn off traction control but leave dynamic stability control engaged. Going around a curve one day and hit some ice and I was real impressed how the DSC gathered it up and put me back on track.

I'm not blaming the vehicles, it's the drivers I'm sure, I just found it funny(it's only a 3 ft ditch on a corner so I'm sure everyone is ok)  Last night my daughter's boyfriend shows up in his Dodge 2500 with a 20ft trailer to help us move. He goes through the field because it's really the only way to get it to the back door. He gets it through a 10"" dip no prob, after a 75 point turn gets the trailer in position, unhooks it. Back out and gets stuck in the lil dip plus maybe 6"" of snow/slush.  He's pissed, trying to rock it out, not working. I offer to pull him out, nope.  He's stuck for a good 10-15 mins, so I crawl through with our gmc in 2wd, waving and laughing. Now he's pissed.  I go around the block, hop in the traverse and do the same lol, now he's REALLY pissed!  I offer again to haul him out with our lil all wheel drive traverse ???. Again he declines.  Finally he gets out of that lil dip but again gets stuck in the open field. I'm dying laughing. A friggen car could drive through this zero issues.  Anyhow, after trying multiple runs he gets out.  Moral of the story? I don't care what make of truck you have, if your tires suck, your not going anywhere lol  Also, KNOWING HOW TO DRIVE YOURE VEHICLE HELPS ALOT???"

We bought there as they had the best selection for 2011's as the 2012's had already been out for a few months plus an old pal got the commission. I went for service there 3 times and then tapped out. Terrible service, plus it's 45 minutes to get there for me. Like I said all show and no go. I don't need WIFI or to look at a big screen to see where my truck is in que. I need an oil and filter change in less than 90 minutes, and that's with an appointment booked. The last time after an hour I asked for my keys back and they begged me not to leave because they knew I wasn't coming back. Stopped at Searle's in Caledonia on the way home and had the truck serviced in less than 40 minutes, no appointment. On my way out of Bear I stopped in to talk to the GM and gave him my 2 cents.  I bet 60% of all vehicles I have owned since 72' were Silver Grey as is my silver Silverado. My wife's black Altima looks dirty because of water spots pulling out of the car wash."

A/C on, Fan on higher speeds, lightly pushing brake pedal or putting a trailer light test plug in your bumper receptacle to fool it into thinking you're trailering.  On my ta du list for this week to figure out a permanent work around as as you say it's a PITA.

1015899,scugpg,2017-10-19 00:53:00,1373,I love the ecodiesel so far it's been great. Recently looked at a truck for the 2nd vehicle and test drove both the 8spd hemi and ED. The hemi performs well but to be honest I find it a tad noisy and have to really push the pedal to get into the power band compared to the ecodiesel. That plus I found the MDS annoying as you could really tell when it kicked in. Affects the sound and feel of the truck and no way to easily disable it. Should be a sport mode or something to have the option love the Jeep does. Gave decent mpgs for a v8 though in the brief drive.  Still considering the hemi though as I know it's solid and the Ram with the air ride and interior is awesome to anything else I've seen.

I have a similar feature on my Silverado where the engine drops to 4 cylinders if the truck is within a certain speed/rpm range. I'm fine with it because I never know if it's doing it until I watch the display and the dash(V8>>V4). Maybe we're talking about two different features?
1015994,Dutch01,2017-10-20 14:42:00,1431,On the Chevy you have to drop it from Drive to M5 for it to stop using four cylinder mode. Whether you're in tow/haul or not.

Just got back from a trip yesterday. I can get there and back on a quarter tank not towing, I used 3/4's of a tank towing this week. I don't drive hard, anymore."

1011567,Raf,2017-08-17 22:36:00,3495,i did the math recently comparing a diesel vs gasser truck  assuming:  30k per year driving  3l/100 difference between vehicles  fuel at $1/liter  = $900 in fuel costs per year savings.  propably doesn't matter to someone driving <10k a year but it adds up quick when you drive a lot.

Would've also gone with a Tundra had the dealership had any interest in selling me one. My MPG is horrible compared to the numbers I'm seeing posted here, I'm averaging 17.2 litres per 100 km over the first 3000km on the odometer. Mostly city, some highway and some towing. Hope to see an improvement as the engine breaks in maybe. Otherwise seems decent. Big and reasonably powerful although somehow preferred the throttle response on my old tundra. Haven't managed to run against a hemi yet, imagine it would be pretty comparable off the line. I think I would've been just as happy with a full size 4x4 from any of the other manufacturers though.

Thought it may have just been the MAF or O2 sensor as the truck seemed to be running totally fine. But im still under warranty so I bring the truck in to Downsview dodge.  Over time i have also noticed that my coolant has slowly been draining, did a little research and learned that there are issues with the EGR coolers leaking.  Anyways truck goes in I get a call the EGR system is totally blown. full of soot and needs to be completely replaced. They swap the entire system out and i go and pick up my truck. I immediately notice that the truck is now making a very strong whistling sound...but the dealer is closed. I also need my truck so whatever a vacuum leak isnt the end of the world, ill take it back in to get it fixed...im not impressed but it is what it is....except that on the drive to Georgetown to drop my dog off an hour later, driving down the 401 my truck whistling away boom shudder, throttle control hits i get a big red lightning bolt and a warning to service to throttle control sensor and i throw another CEL....great  i limp my truck to georgetown dodge  (its 8pm) and they tell me that they cant service my truck because downsview had done something wrong. Their suggestion is to get it towed using road side assistance, back to downsview. I tell them that I will deal with it tomorrow and they say thats fine that i can park it there until it can be towed.  The next day comes around, i have to go back to toronto for a doctor appointment so i drive my moms vehicle back to toronto, go to my appointment and drop the key off with downsview dodge. I then call roadside assistance where they proceed to tell me that  1. They wont tow vehicles from one dealer to another 2. That the tow exceeds my allowed mileage 3. that the tow truck driver needs to keys (which are at downsview)  i basically tell the lady on the phone ""ok ill go put my truck in neutral and push it out into the middle of highway 7 and then you can tow it for me...and you can send the invoice for the additional mileage directly to downsview chrysler.  They get my tone and work everything out. I have to call the tow truck company and convince them to just frigging tow the truck on a dolly...they dont want to but I explain that whatever costs associated with the trouble will be covered by the dealer its not my problem.  They eventually oblige and its now been 2 days and I just right now found out my truck is available for pick up.  I will never buy a dodge again.

Well you might get a bit uncomfortable pulling a (RvW) Rip van Winkle waiting that long.   They were contemplating the Cummins 5.0 but they too fell asleep and Nissan grabbed them.  Not all that great for mileage either.  Read a bit about some of the Yota diesels, some good, and some were total junk, at least by owners comments."
1011494,Cosmos,2017-08-16 23:17:00,588,I own 2016 outdoorsman with v6 and 8 speed transmission. I am very happy with this truck. It's my first brand new car. My fuel consumption is 12 l/100 km with mostly city driving.
1011505,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-17 01:39:00,8243,I have no idea how many litres/100 km I get. All I know is when I'm low on gas I fill it up. Unless those that have a vehicle for business I know of no one that has sold there ride because they are using a few liters more than he guy in the other vehicle. 1 liter more of fuel over 62 miles (100KMS) is .0174 cents per mile at $1.08 a liter. How much is a Hortons coffee now?

1011508,Terry,2017-08-17 01:49:00,14456,yeah but how much savings is it once you reach 200000 km
1011509,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-17 03:03:00,8243,"Driving 24,000 KM per year that would be around $12,166.00 of Tim coffee buying 2 cups a day, not factoring in inflation. They say a person that buys some coffee and snacks or 10 bucks a day spends over $100,000.00 in ones working years, if they retire after 30 years, not factoring in inflation.  Yes we can 2 dollar a day ourselves to death. I don't disagree Terry, I just don't want to add it all up as I go through life. I just can't stress over a few bucks a week for fuel driving as little as I do now, which yes adds up of course."

Sorry to say the Titan is a gas sucking pig. Fun to drive and well built but the mileage has been an issue in my 2005 and my buddies 2012. Keep your foot out of it and it will shift for economy after it realises you are not an aggressive driver. Keep on top of recalls and they stick to there warranty schedule way tighter than Ford does.

I rechecked into Dodge Ram promaster in 2015 as well as Chevy, Nissan and Ford. The Dodge Ram was using a front wheel drive and a new motor from Fiat. The sheet metal work and fit and finish was substandard compared to the other 3 but it was on par with the price they cost. I test drove it and at 65 mph the sides flexed and made noise as well as the wind noise made it unpleasant to drive. The Nissan had a sold build but the fuel mileage was horrible. That said a fellow tradesman ran his for 150,000miles with only maintenance and a rear axle replacement. I decided on the Ford full size 250 Transit with a ecoboost gas engine. At 45000 miles it has had no repairs only maintenance and averages 14.7 per 100 kilometers combined with a full load of tools and material. The difference between them price wise was around 10,000.oo dollars that I am glad I spent because of the way it was built and the way Ford supports it. This is the second eco boost that I have 2012 f150 is doing well and so far I am still pleased with it.

So I say, black for the price of the white, this amount for my Avenger as the trade in. The reply was, will you be taking it before sept 1st. Ah ya. Then Im thinking, thats was a weird question. Find out that was the dead line for their , win the dealership award for selling the most cars and trucks. Leverage to me. So I say now, Black truck plus a hard top cover and we have a deal. HMMMMMM OK. So black truck,cover out the door,$18,000.Still owed on the avenger,so it all balanced out in the end.  Bought it in Mississauga. Ontario Crysler. Barrie was out to lunch on their prices. I couldnt by a used truck for that price here."

Outdoors man has lsd diff and 3.92 gears best of both worlds  with the 8 so very little issues with 8 so tranny hemi bombproof so long as regular lof done.

1011080,Canuck2fan,2017-08-11 02:03:00,1444,"Are you sure you can't do better overall getting a new Ram with all the deals they have now? Unless you are paying cash it would have to be almost a give away for me to look at a used Ram given the current deals available on new ones... As the monthly payments could easily be less for a new vehicle, with full warranty and hopefully a higher resale value in the future.  If you can find the trim you want that is.  Some dealerships are offering 30%+ off new. Up from 25% off in the last few months so the selection might be slim now.
