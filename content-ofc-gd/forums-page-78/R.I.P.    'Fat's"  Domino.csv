He had many hits and did concerts with Rick Nelson. His version of Blueberry Hill has many memorys for many people,  haha. May he rest in peace in Rock and Roll Heaven.."
1016266,DanD,2017-10-25 18:44:00,2223,Great performer; he'll live on with his recordings. In my 50 Chevy I pay his music all the time and its good and loud! It is sad but he's at rest now and wont be forgotten; by his fans.  Dan
