Just killed perch and mostly all good sized ones...very few throwbacks.  Can't wait to see what it's like during the first half of the season.  Always have enjoyed and looked forward to the ice season. This coming season even more.

Made a ply wood retainer this year for the sand bags. 200 pounds per side. Man that truck rides so smooth with this weight.   The hut and smitty fit nice. Enough room for the auger beside it and my 2 milk crates. Fits like a glove.The 5X ELITE is back in it,s ice bag as well.

When I lived in Brampton in the early 80,s, I was in the same mind set. I was in the middle of the winterfest. South open water,north the covered waters.  Living in Barrie, and I still have the same decisions, but travel is much less. The winters are not the same. Rivers here are open in December and lakes are not harden up. So traveling is much less ,when I decide where to go. Nice to have the best of both I would say."
