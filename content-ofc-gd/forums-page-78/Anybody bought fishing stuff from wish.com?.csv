I bought a few baits, some braid at a fraction of the price of Power Pro and a hand held wireless transducer fish finder ($30) I hope to use when portaging into back lakes.  I'm still waiting and haven't got anything yet.  Any experiences? is this gonna be a Chinese garbage let down?"

She bought me a wireless Bluetooth speaker and it's awesome!  Their shipping sucks something fierce though. She's complained about packages showing up 2 months later

But the hooks I bought (no name) and swivels were great and a fraction of the price I would have paid anywhere else Cheers Gordy"
