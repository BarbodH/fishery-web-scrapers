1016215,Rustic-Fisher,2017-10-24 22:58:00,826,"Hey Guys , thoughts  on the 20'Legend camo cc? thinking of buying one with a merc 115. As a family we fish and duck hunt  , this boat seems to fit the bill.  Zero info on the net as far as reviews for this rig. Any opinions? Thanks guys. R "
1016217,porkpie,2017-10-24 23:10:00,2521,"indknt know that I'd go with a 115 on a 20, I think I'd step up to a 150 especially in a deep V.  My boats 18.5 with a 100 inch beam.  I have a 140 Suzuki and while it gets on plane quickly, and is decent with just me in the boat, it's not a speed racer especially if I have a couple of guests.  If your hunting your probably going to do the 75 plus decoy spread or even layout boats if your looking at that size hull so that plus guys is a lot of extra weight.  As for legend, well no experience other than knowing guys that have bought them, then sold them a few years down the line."
1016219,OhioFisherman,2017-10-24 23:34:00,6623,  Do they still make that model?
1016220,Rustic-Fisher,2017-10-25 00:06:00,826,No . It's not in the line up anymore . Seems it was a short run .
1016221,DRIFTER_016,2017-10-25 00:31:00,10439,115 will be plenty of power on a 20 foot john boat. I would think it would be a great duck boat. Would be rough in a chop though. I bought my boat from Legend back in '91. It's been a great boat.  Looking at getting a 14' utility boat from them to add to the fleet.
1016222,OhioFisherman,2017-10-25 01:26:00,6623,"No . It's not in the line up anymore . Seems it was a short run .  I know nothing about duck hunting, but that boat might have been too big of an investment for people that pursue the sport with a very limited season? Low sales might have killed it? Looks like it quite capable of doing both, a 115 should push it well."
1016223,Freshtrax,2017-10-25 01:37:00,2215,I want one . Is all I can say.
1016225,porkpie,2017-10-25 01:47:00,2521,"I didn't even know legend made Jon boats, I just assumed it was a V.  Yeah in that case a 115 would be plenty."
1016226,chris.brock,2017-10-25 02:13:00,4053,"You're asking for opinions so- I'm not big on Legend, the Merc 115 or the Jon boat hull design, JMHO  Like Ohio FM said, the duck hunting is likely a small fraction of the time you're going to spend in the boat"
1016239,Sinker,2017-10-25 11:27:00,8692,"As you know, i duck hunt a lot. I hate john boats. Im not a merc fan, or legend either.  Youd be far better off with a deep V utility style boat IMO. That center console is hard to hide, and even harder to put a blind on. Picking up decoys is a pain in the butt without a tiller too. Id be looking for an alaskan, or starcraft tiller if it was me.  Again, its just my opinion. Im just a guy who duck hunts and fished way too much.  S."
1016240,Rustic-Fisher,2017-10-25 11:30:00,826,Thanks guys . Keep the info and opinions coming   appreciate it !
1016485,Rustic-Fisher,2017-10-28 21:28:00,826,"Thanks again guys , went ahead and purchased the rig, its actually a Polar Kraft Sportsman with Legend Decals LOL. Boat will pull double duty as a Duck Boat AND fishing rig, at 20' everyone should have room while chasing ducks . R"
1016487,DRIFTER_016,2017-10-28 22:27:00,10439,A lot of their boats are re-branded other manufacturers boats. Mine is a Fisher.

It's all about finding something that fits your needs and budget."
1016494,John Bacon,2017-10-29 02:16:00,3277,"A lot of their boats are re-branded other manufacturers boats. Mine is a Fisher.  I think they all are.  From what I understand, Legend does not build any boat hulls.  I think they do add some of the trim on boats."
1016498,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-29 03:21:00,8243,"Congrats Ryan, I hope it works for you. Watch your wind prediction sites and be smart before heading out in that boat on any lake. I will never set my butt in one since I saw the ""White Light"" in a Jon style boat on a 500 acre wind protected lake. That's when I bought our StarCraft deep V."
