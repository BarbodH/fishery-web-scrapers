A few things I noticed, a good amount of blood was being spewed out from the gills on the one shark at the start of the video, injured from competing for the whale maybe. I can't see it coming from the Whale. Is that a crack on the right side of the sub's windscreen? I hope not at any depth let alone 750 metres down the abyss. Those guys are gonna' need a bigger Sub!"
