1017285,BassMan11,2017-11-09 21:58:00,583,Just got home from my local Cabelas here in Ottawa. Seem that they are having an end of year clearance on high end rods. Certain Legend Extremes and G.Loomis NRXs (all sold out in Ottawa) Were on sale for 199. Along with lots of other rods and reels on sale at clearnece prices. Also some terminal tackle as well ( tungsten weights on for 2.99).  Just a heads up since they will be gone fast!

1017295,BassMan11,2017-11-09 23:02:00,583,I asked the guy there if there were any left. He said as soon as the price list came out employees at the store bought them all. The were a couple GL3s on sale for 199 as well as IMX float rods for 199.  Even a St Croix legend extreme in the 500 range on for 199. A couple of them in Ottawa as of 430pm today.
