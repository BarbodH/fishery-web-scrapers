1016198,davis,2017-10-24 18:33:00,128,Well. Talked to rapala today. Told me to bring it back to CT. Thank god i swiped my CT money card or there would have been no record of me every buying it. Exchanged it for the same lure. Lets see if this one lasts longer than 2 days and few fish..... Just fyi - i returned an item to CT on the weekend without a receipt. They used my debit card to find the transaction as proof of purchase.
1016202,Lape0019,2017-10-24 19:59:00,647,"Hate to break the news to you but a $13.00 lure is on the cheap side these days. It should still hold up better than yours did but with Lucky craft in the $20 range and Megabass over $30 for a jerk bait, Rapala is on the lower end of the spectrum.  And no matter how expensive the lure, there is always something that someone won't like about them."
1016460,b_cdot,2017-10-28 01:37:00,270, Gotta love that! No one keeps receipts for that stuff
1016461,b_cdot,2017-10-28 01:38:00,270,Throw at your own risk around the toothy critters. Too bad i love em for smb but there are always fish with line snippers hanging around

They just don't work as well as others, Reef Runners, Ripplin Redfin, old AC Bombers, Greasy Chicken, Limp Richards, Mamas Stew and Pink Panties spoons to name a few of the crazy spoons here. This year Erie Dearies worked well, they came out over 40 years ago. As far as quality you pay for what you get. But I will never pay 15 bananas for a plastic body anything. I do have a few Live Target plugs I paid 20 bucks for that stay in the box in case I loose them. That should go in stupid things one has done thread.  You know the saying, new tackle catches more fisherman than fish."

1015632,bigugli,2017-10-16 03:43:00,6138,I had so much trouble with other plastic rapalas like the Shad and the X-rap that I refuse to buy any of their plastic product. I will continue to buy their wooden plugs. They have never failed me. Of course I rarely need to replace those as they seem to last forever.

1015734,manitoubass2,2017-10-17 03:02:00,11391,No it's just fishing heavy current. They run true on the lakes no prob
1015759,kickingfrog,2017-10-17 16:37:00,8333,Some might be confusing Lucky Craft and Lucky Strike. Lucky Craft are generally  $20 plus for bass type cranks and Lucky Stike are less then $10.

I have luck on the shad rap and some older wooden models, but that's it. LOL The same with reef runners, I went out a few years back when we were fishing Quinte often and bought a bunch because everyone raved about reef runners. I have not caught a fish on a reef runner. :-( The rapala price sure doesn't make them attractive and either do these reports."
1015841,Duckie,2017-10-18 15:56:00,305,"the newer rapalas may be garbage and overpriced, but I still stand by the Jointed Shad Rap and the X Rap Shad as two of the greatest crankbaits of all time. They have been around for a while now. but are really good. never had any issues with breakage etc."

1015910,b_cdot,2017-10-19 04:54:00,270,These baits aren't made to rise. They are slow sinking/suspending baits. Mono will help you work the bait a bit higher in the water column but dont expect it to rise on a pause

Fish it all day long caught 1 or 2 fish on it but notice that I am missing all my hits. Probably 10-15 strikes and couldnt hookup. Just figured it was one of those freak days. Then I have 2 big smallies following my bait went to pause it to get her to hit and the damn thing sunk like a stone and the smallie swiped at it and swam away. I checked it out and the bait was full of water. Went online and saw this was a common problem, I want to return in but is it worth it for shipping? Is rapala known for giving you more gear to makeup for shipping costs? Ive done this with strike king and they were happy to throw in some more baits to offset shipping, I can't believe rapala would throw these cheap things on the shelf. COME ON! Hope they fix the problem....  "
