Maine seems to be the last stronghold for wild native salmon and trout in the east.  NE used to have huge runs of Sea-run brookies too, but they're all but extirpated now I believe.  Sounds like there's been a big wave of homegrown conservation groups doing some great work with habitat restoration down there, I'm sure there's still plenty of hope still."
