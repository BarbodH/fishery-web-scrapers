1016545,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-30 02:47:00,8243,"If you told me any Walleye would be there today I wouldn't believe you. Good to see, congrats. Please DO NOT EAT IT."
1016546,japper,2017-10-30 02:54:00,31,"lots of big ones in there, big pike too, got a 15 lb last weekend. Wasn’t  really fishing for them though, trying to see if any Trout were in yet. And yes, it’s still swimming in the bay...... (although the Ontario guide to eating fish says you can indeed eat em)"
1016550,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-30 03:15:00,8243,I don't care what the guide says DO NOT EAT ANYTHING FROM THE BAY. Research Randle Reef.
1016551,japper,2017-10-30 03:22:00,31,"Ya, I’m familiar with it.  It is good to see the walleye coming back though."
1016573,BillM,2017-10-30 14:42:00,17367,Nice fish!
1016581,AKRISONER,2017-10-30 15:54:00,5558,"this is great to see!  it always amazed me that Lake O wasnt like the others, now i sometimes wish i had a boat down here as well...wait till the smallies really make a full come back around Toronto. I know theres some excellent largie and pike fishing in around the islands...itd be wicked to have lake erie style fishing right here in the city.  The salmon/trout guys probably think im crazy."
1016598,BillM,2017-10-30 18:38:00,17367,Lake O is loaded with smallmouth pretty much everywhere.    No one really bothers to fish them.
1016613,buick14,2017-10-30 20:52:00,741,"^ I try, however I fail ...miserably"
1016614,dave524,2017-10-30 20:56:00,4508,Lake O is loaded with smallmouth pretty much everywhere.    No one really bothers to fish them.  largies mostly on the south shore. Jordan Harbour and pretty much any marina and inlet has a good number
1016617,huzzsaba,2017-10-30 21:31:00,884,"congrats on the Walleye!  My question, why would they stock the hamilton harbour and not elsewhere? Walleye are probably the most sought after for eating, they should stock them in less toxic environment.  Would be nice to fish for them from the local piers."
1016620,japper,2017-10-30 23:22:00,31,"Thery have spent millions to clean up Hamilton Harbour. They stocked over 50000 walleye on 2012. They wanted to see if they would stay & grow. They have, in big numbers, now they want to see if they will reproduce in the Harbour."
1016621,Rizzo,2017-10-30 23:50:00,4754,that's a beauty fish
1016625,ketchenany,2017-10-31 00:59:00,3229,"I did the guide for a few years! OI is right don’t even touch it never mind eating it! It was a waste of money producing it! Promote CAR instead, we even did brochures in other languages.  I don’t think they print it anymore."

Thery have spent millions to clean up Hamilton Harbour. They stocked over 50000 walleye on 2012. They wanted to see if they would stay & grow. They have, in big numbers, now they want to see if they will reproduce in the Harbour. There are only so many fish available for stocking.  If they are spread the around the entire lake then they would be too spread out to create any fishery of note.  By putting them in one spot, they can create a local fishery.  Despite it's reputation, Hamilton Harbour does have good habitat to support walleye reproduction.  Going forward, they will stock Toronto in odd numbered years (100,000 in 2017) and Hamilton in even numbered years.  Perhaps they will eventually establish fisheries around the lake.    "
1016636,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-31 10:57:00,8243,"They may have used the Walleye as a Litmus test to ascertain true water quality in the Bay. It may have backfired, we know there will be some people that will eat them."
1016650,japper,2017-10-31 15:33:00,31,"It didnt backfire, walleye are doing well. Its actually become a very good fishery."
1016660,Mike Pike,2017-10-31 19:47:00,1332,"Growing up in Hamilton in the 70s and 80s, anyone who thought that we could have a walleye fishery in the harbour would have been considered delusional.  A walleye was a fish you had to travel north for.  But here they are.  Wow."
1016682,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-01 00:13:00,8243,"Backfire in as far as some people will consider if there are Walleye there they must be edible. I know there are some that will eat them regardless of warnings and the eating guides provided by the Ministry. A fish here and there won't kill you but if you knew what was dumped in there up to the late 70's you wouldn't even wade in that water at Pier 4. I fell in once when working as a weekend student in the early 70's (don't ask). It took a few seconds before I broke through the crud on the surface at the East Side Lagoon at Stelco. I looked like the Creature of the Black Lagoon when I was pulled out, black from head to toe covered in who knows what. The hospital treated me like I was in a Nuclear fallout accident. I spend 2 nights in the General. Which was a good thing I suppose, scared the Bejeezus out of me actually so I am somewhat weary of that water. Back then it was control pollution by dilution."
1016699,Henricus,2017-11-01 03:13:00,118,Nice fish.  Even though the kayak is stored for the season I am still curious as to the water temp?
1016702,japper,2017-11-01 03:34:00,31,It was 58 degrees last weekend. Got the walleye in about 12 feet of water.

Back then it was control pollution by dilution.  unfortunately Iron...in line with the thought process of the time...if you didnt immediately get sick they think you are fine. The carcinogens in the harbour take years to manifest and kill a person. Im sure your limited exposure is fine, but the ridiculous amount of biomagnification especially for a preditorial fish like a walleye...sheesh, they should have selected something a little less edible.  I can just see it now...the white bucket brigade has a hayday down there and starts spreading the poison through the entire community at the market. Jeebus. Fresh caught white fish!"
