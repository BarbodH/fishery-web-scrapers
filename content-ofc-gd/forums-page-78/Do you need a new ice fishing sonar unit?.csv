1016447,muskymatt,2017-10-27 23:01:00,2608,"That's insane. I was looking up ice hut and you can't get a quality one for under $700 +- Cordless drill augers are crazy $700 and up Gar augers $700 and up, closer to $1000 Even the less expensive flashers are almost $800 now Clothing is ridiculous with a decent set at $700 It's all a money grab now, getting into the sport if you want to set yourself up decently can run an angler over $4000  No wonder why I take care of my stuff and make it last as long as I can.
