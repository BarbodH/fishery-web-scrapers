However, under faster speed, it sputtered, then slowly stopped. Seems motor couldn't provide fuel under fairly high speed. I changed fuel line with bulb, fuel filter inside, plus filled some new gas in, but issue still there.  I am not sure it's related to fuel or electronics, or..? Any suggestion.  The motor is  year.2008 4 stroke EFI."

1016329,LeXXington,2017-10-26 14:09:00,1928,"Had my 2006 do the same.    Ran fine at lower speed put the throttle down runs for a few min then sputters and sometimes dies. Throttle back no issue.. Tried the same you did bulb, gas, filter,etc  Was electrical issue drawing more that the battery could output.  Replaced battery with bigger battery problem solved."
1016338,linweir,2017-10-26 15:58:00,202,"Txs for all tips Tried to use a deep cycle battery to turn ignition on, then ran. Problem still there. Sent it to marine for service. Hope it's not big deal.  Will keep it posted."
