1011208,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-12 17:17:00,8243,I had a similar Sea Eagle up until a few years ago. I actually had it for sale here. Take it from me you don't stand up in one. It came up from the US.

1011228,John Bacon,2017-08-12 22:01:00,3277,Cabelas used to carry Sea Eagle.  I am not sure if they still do.
1011242,J Roelofsen,2017-08-13 03:08:00,84,"The oars may leave something to be desired on those boats. If your primarily gonna use a trolling motor that may not be an issue. You can always add a higher seatpost to the toon you have if you want a higher seating position.  Speaking from plenty of experience (I own several toons and other small watercraft) I usually prefer a boat where I can kick my feet to orient myself for casting. 2 of my solo pontoons have pull out casting platforms but they rarely get used (except to relieve myself without going ashore). I think those boats would be plenty stable for standing in with the solid floor.  Your fishing situations may differ from mine tho, just things to think about...  There's one for sale on kijiji right now with a Shakespeare outboard, you may be able to swing a deal without the motor?  Josh"
1011246,misfish,2017-08-13 15:29:00,29133,This is my second one. I would be interested in what you meant by a pull out casting platform.Do you have a pic ?  
1011278,J Roelofsen,2017-08-14 02:37:00,84,"I've got a couple Scadden 'toons that are similar to this. I don't bother with the leaning bar, haven't found that I need it. The platform slides under the seat when not in use. It's definitely a handy feature;)https://flic.kr/p/WsLPNx  Also have a set of tubes that I can put my solo frames on and convert to a big 2 man boat. I find most passengers appreciate the leaning bar on this boat. A higher seat in the front allows for easier sitting/standing transition. I also built a detachable motor mount that serves double duty as a battery bay for days when rowing would be difficult or ineffective. I plan on building a custom one piece frame with a full floor for these tubes in the future. https://flic.kr/p/WsM75v https://flic.kr/p/Xrp6sE https://flic.kr/p/XGhM2X  I also have a Colorado XT I use as a lender boat. Great little toon to get started but the price is getting rediculous! I paid $250 for mine years ago.  Josh"
1011315,misfish,2017-08-14 22:47:00,29133,"Those are some upper class toons. WOW SWEET. Very nice.  I lucked out getting the one in the pic a few years back. CTC had them marked down for $199+ tax. Reg, $400.  A steal, considering a replacement bladder was the same in US funds + shipping.  I like  how light it is and how easy it is to maneuver. With oars or flippers.  Thanks for the pics Josh"
1017211,Supernewf71,2017-11-09 00:54:00,22,Would be neat to try. I am an avid kayak angler and love the ability to go where a lot of boatswain wouldnt dream of going
