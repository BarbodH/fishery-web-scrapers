1016316,bobowski,2017-10-26 04:02:00,360,Well this looks interesting. I can think of a few applications where this might come in handy.    
1016318,Acountdeleted,2017-10-26 11:35:00,2562,Pretty cool. Only problem is what happens if you lose it?
1016322,captpierre,2017-10-26 12:31:00,2521,So why didnt I think of this ?
1016332,JoshS,2017-10-26 15:12:00,729,That's pretty innovative. I'd buy some for deadbait tip ups.
1016335,Sterling,2017-10-26 15:44:00,477,Wish they made them smaller.
1016344,Crazy Ivan,2017-10-26 17:24:00,184,I hope the wife doesnt see this thing.
1016349,Fisherman,2017-10-26 19:27:00,7201,"I hope the wife doesnt see this thing.  Glad you said it, I wasn't about to touch it."
1016353,misfish,2017-10-26 20:19:00,29133," , I wasn't about to touch it.  And you shouldnt be ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
1016364,dave524,2017-10-26 22:35:00,4508,"fresh dead works as well as live ,IMHO,  P.T. Barnum was right"
1016372,lookinforwalleye,2017-10-26 23:15:00,4399,I hope the wife doesnt see this thing. 
1016374,Fisherman,2017-10-27 00:27:00,7201," And you shouldnt be ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  I wish mine could do that, but ya, dead ones work too."
1016379,Tom S,2017-10-27 01:00:00,362,"I feel like this would be 10 times better if it gave intermittent twitches and spasms rather than a steady beat. That steady beat while the bait doesn't move forward or backwards is odd as heck, you might as well troll with a lipped swimbait at that point in my opinion. A random twitch would really make that bait look like it's in distress and dying."
