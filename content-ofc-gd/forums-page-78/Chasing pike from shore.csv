Any tips? Already started exploring Niagara river and Welland.  If you would like to send me any info or simply help shoot me a PM."
1017000,dave524,2017-11-06 11:17:00,4508,Check out the Rec Canal in the vicinity of Ramey's Bend and Dain City if around Welland.
1017025,spyder3g,2017-11-06 18:51:00,50,"You may also tried lake Belwood, it's drained now and pikes concentrated in the remaining deep areas. 2 weeks ago I had some luck in the Northern part of the lake, just before the bridge. I used spoons and minnow jerkbaits."
1017028,Acountdeleted,2017-11-06 20:02:00,2562,"Same with Mountsberg. Resevoiors always do well for pike after they are drained. Jerkbaits, spoons and spinners are my go to."
1017151,mamona,2017-11-08 14:48:00,597,"Thanks, guys. I checked Mountsberg (the closest to my location). Is there any other spot than the dam? The dam was packed with at least 10-15 people."
1017157,spyder3g,2017-11-08 15:59:00,50,"other spot than the dam? I fish from the railway embankment in the bigger portion of the lake. However, itâ€™s prohibited. I think now, when Mountsberg is drained, you cannot find some deep enough spots for casting spoons or minnows. Unless you use heavy silicon baits on the offset hooks without waits."
