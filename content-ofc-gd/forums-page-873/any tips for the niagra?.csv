324678,Bondar,2009-04-01 01:23:00,817,"ice bridge is starting to break up , whirlpool has quite a bit of ice in it ! but the lower is always hit and miss on ice this time of year one day no ice the next it can be full with the ever changing water levels and currents  ice can come and go in an hour or so or hold up in the river with the wind, i'm yet to have a day since november that i couldnt navigate through the ice flows , some days you just have to travel real slow and weave in and out of the bergs ! (aluminum boat ) But with all this the trout action is good lots of steel in the system , be perpared for crowds this time of year on weekends any other questions just pm me happy to help ya out "
