324682,canadian_copper,2009-04-01 01:26:00,925,GOT OUT ON MON AFTER THE RAINS AND HAD A HAYDAY ON SOME STEEL. REALLY PRETTY FISH ALL AROUND THE 2-4LB MARK. LOST ONE TANK CLOSE TO 20 UNDER A PIPE. WATER HAD A GOOD STAIN. JUST A FEW.   NICE DROPBACK HEN. NICE TO SEE HER SPAWNED OUT BEFORE OPENER.   THIS MALE PUT UP A HELL OF A FIGHT   GOT OUT THIS MORN ON ANOTHER RIVER WITH KEV AGAIN. WATER WAS TOO MUDDY YESTERDAY SO WE KNEW TODAY SHOULD BE PRIME. WATER WAS AMAZING. JUST HARDLY ANY FISH. I'D HAVE TO SAY NOW THAT WERE IN APRIL AND WITH ALL THE MELT OFF AND BIG RAINS A HUGE PORTION OF THE RUNS ARE ALREADY UP. HAD TO WORK REAL HARD FOR THE FISH TODAY BUT HERES A FEW         PET-PEEVE OF THE DAY WHEN SOMEONE SAYS FISH ON DONT BE AN IDIOT AND STAND THERE LEAVING YOUR LINE IN THE WATER. WE USE SUCH LIGHT LINE ON SUCH A BIG FISH ITS HARD ENOUGH AS IT IS WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT EVERYONE ELSES LINE. ITS ONLY GOOD RIVER EDICATE TO PULL YOUR LINE OUT TILL THE FISH IS LANDED. YOU'D EPECT THE SAME FOR U. KEV'S ONLY FISH OF THE DAY AND IT WAS A TANK LOST CAUSE THIS GUY WOULDNT GET HIS LINE OUT OF THE WATER AND THEY TANGLED. LUCKY KEV IS COOL TEMPT. IF THAT WAS MY ONLY FISH ALL DAY AND U WANNA BE AN IDIOT U MIGHT BE A WET ONE.
