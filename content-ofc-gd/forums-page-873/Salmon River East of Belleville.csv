I want to do some canoeing on it, sometime this summer and thought I would also do some fishing as well. I will likely put in somewhere around the 401 unless there is a better stretch of the river. I am not looking for hot spots for fish, just if one stretch of the river is better for canoeing and or fishing. thanks in advance sunchaser81"

324471,sunchaser81,2009-03-31 17:28:00,11,Thank you ehg That's just what I was looking for. sunchaser81
324473,davew3,2009-03-31 17:30:00,430,"Sunchaser.   As you cannot park on the 401 you wouldn't be able to put in there.  But if you take Shannonville rd and follow it down you come to hwy 2.  Go straight through and there is a park there.   You can put in and travel down to the BOQ.  There is also a small side lake you can hit.   In here are bass, perch walleye and pike.   The water is usally smooth unless it is a west wind.  Now if you do look around just upstream there is a dam.  I do not know about putting in there but you could ask the people at the store. Good luck."
