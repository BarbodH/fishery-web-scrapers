While searching I ran into the Prodigy Round Baitcast reel on Cabelas site and it seems really interesting (I have a gear aquisition problem).  I know the low profile version of this reel is basically a Daiwa Advantage.  Does anyone know if Daiwa also makes this one?  If so do you know what model and if it is any good?   Thx, Leigh"
324142,leighfns,2009-03-30 21:30:00,103,Well either it really sucks or is the best kept secret
324150,mikeh,2009-03-30 21:39:00,824,If it's made by Daiwa it will be a solid reel. The reply's on Cabela's webpage are pretty good also. Get one and let us know how it goes.
324188,leighfns,2009-03-30 22:48:00,103, Sound like an idea to me   I will report back soon....
324201,danc,2009-03-30 23:38:00,4677,"I bought a Prodigy spinning reel last year. As you mentioned, it is a re branded Diawa. I'm happy with mine."
324293,NANUK,2009-03-31 03:14:00,797,"Cabelas spinning Prodigy is made by Daiwa for sure, however this round baitaster doesn't appear to be made by Daiwa, my guess its an Okuma, that's just my observation."
324322,leighfns,2009-03-31 04:19:00,103,  I think you are right...  Check out this Ryobi Varius
324337,jace,2009-03-31 08:27:00,472," ryobi sold their fishing division a few years back so it's hard to say exactly how their new products compare.   That's the reason they've dropped out of sight in our stores.   In the past though, they put out some top quality gear with a reel or two retailing close to $1000.     knowing nothing else though, i would go by the user reviews and make a judgement from there.  Besides that, i think Cabelas has 60 day return policy on cabelas branded items.   try it and keep only if you like it."
324338,jace,2009-03-31 08:37:00,472," The new spinning reel is a reworked Exceler, the older prodigy spinner is a Capricorn.   They usually add a bearing or something before they get a reel store branded so, in  a way, they're all better value than the originals.  you won't go wrong with their C5, the revo SC, and prodigy baitcaster either."
