324529,cricket220,2009-03-31 20:32:00,2,My family and I have been searching for a good resort for us to go to. We have two kids that are 10 and 13 and we want to bring them up to Canada for a fishing trip. The problem is we have never been and don't know where to go. We went to the Northwest Sports Show and Nungesser Lake seems to be one of the better spots. So We looked into the two lodges there and Anglers Kingdom was one the best looking ones. But we are still curious one other peoples opinions and ideas so if you can help us out that would be great.
