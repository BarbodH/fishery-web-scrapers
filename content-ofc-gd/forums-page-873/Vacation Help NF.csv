I know that many members on this board have travelled the world and I'm wondering if you could suggest somewhere. This is going to be a surprise and I know some of the lurkers on this board know my wife well, so V, keep it quiet!  Anyway, any suggestions or help, I have a reasonable budget and I'm looking for something special.  Thanks  Dave"

324050,grt1,2009-03-30 16:59:00,638,I guess any recommendations would depend on the time of the year you wanted to go. I don't think you'd want to be in Florida in July or August or Whitehorse in November thru February.  give us the timeline you are looking at I'm sure we can come up with somekind of romantic fishing resorts
324053,fishing n autograph,2009-03-30 17:07:00,2540,june or july

324059,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-30 17:16:00,10439,  Paris is nice. France not Ontario!!!! Although Paris Ontario does have it's own charms.  Italy would be another good choice at that time of year.
324061,RuNnYoOzE,2009-03-30 17:20:00,270,seriously need to look to Northern Ontario...Lake of the woods rent a cabin for a week....nightly campfires near the lake...millions of mosquitoes and GREAT fishing while the wife is sleeping..P/s don't forget the sleeping pills and very comfy pillow..you actually make her enjoy the trip and get some great fishing in it's win-win! ...did I mention there's great fishing there? and yea most cottages you can rent boats!

324092,charlied,2009-03-30 19:33:00,584,I would recommend any Riu palace except in the dominican republic.  They are a fantastic hotel....5 plus stars.  I have been to the one in cabo san lucas.  The town is very nice and tons of shopping for the lady.  The deep sea Marlin charters are very good as well.   Plus across from the hotel is  El Arco.....very awsome.  white sandy beach on one side and crashing waves on the other side to watch people body surf.  The beach at the hotel is not all that nice.  very hard sand and the water drops off very quickly makes it hard to swim.  Other than these 2 things I had an amazing vacation there.  hope this helps!
324114,Billy Bob,2009-03-30 20:26:00,5865,"VEGAS baby.......... You and your wife will LOVE 4 or 5 days in VEGAS. BOOK now and get some of the greatest deals around.... (cut rates because of the economy) We have been there 5 times and my wife would go again at the drop of a hat.  You DON'T have to be gamblers in the LEAST to enjoy VEGAS...... There are sooooo many top shows to see and FREE stuff to do you will LOVE it. The HOTELS are HUGE and have GREAT pools, SPA's etc.......  Now here's my best tip I can give you. We have been to several different hotel/casino's and I HIGHLY recommend GMG GRAND.....  MGM Grand has over 5,000 room and 28 restaurants with MANY being top rated restaurants. EMERILS, Wolfgang Puck etc...... are there and several others. Not to mention all the other hotels on the strip. The strip is over 4 miles long with one hotel / casino next to the other. But these places are so large it might take you 30 - 40 minutes to walk next door. BELIEVE ME there is so much to do there, especially if you plan your trip in advance you never have to gamble a nickel but you WILL...........LOL  If you don't mind driving down to Buffalo International Airport you can get a NON STOP flight leaving at 8am and arriving in VEGAS at 10:10am Vegas time. ALWAYS book the cheapest room and tip the check in clerk $20 for a FREE upgrade. WORKS every time. Make sure you check out Southwest VACATIONS packages.  Some of the top shows to see is Danny Ganns, Reda Rutner and La Famme (Crazy Horse) in MGM Grand. There are several other TOP shows including ""O"", Zumanty, Ka, Beatles plus several others.   Here are a couple links to get you started. (to get a good DEAL  check out the Southwest Vacations link)  http://www.mgmgrand.com/  http://www.southwestvacations.com/?cmpid=O...mp;referrer=S01  PM me for any more tips if VEGAS is your choice. Like I have said we have been there a few times and know many tips that might help you.  Bob"
324276,Dnthmn,2009-03-31 02:48:00,128,"Almond Beach Club in Barbados...You can send the wife to the spa for a massage while you head out reef fishing with a local guide. I believe they have an anniversary/wedding package that will include some spa treatments and the reef fishing is free but I suggest you tip your guide.  http://www.almondresorts.com/  I agree with the spots in Europe that were mentioned as well. Only one I'll add is Belgium (Brugge to be exact) The tourist district is actually the old walled city and many of the buildings date back hundreds of years. If your a fan of history, food and beer this is a great spot. I'll try to dig up some pics."
324301,Cudz,2009-03-31 03:27:00,2652,"I have lived in 5 different countries on 4 different continents and have visited countless others.  When you narrow it down shoot me a PM and I will let you know what I think. I spent my honeymoon in the Maldives at a 5 star resort.  Pretty much had what felt like our own island to ourselves.  Incredible time in an impressive place. I also lived in Dubai for 8 years.  Australia, Germany and England. If you have any questions about those or other neighbouring countries, I do have some knowledge."
