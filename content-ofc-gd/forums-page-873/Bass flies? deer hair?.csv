But you can also tie them so the tag ends face forward over the eye of the hook. Then you bend it back over towards the bend and wrap it a few times. Saves the mess of cutting. However the cutting allows you mix colours better. If you dont know what i mean, its a very similar method to tying the ""Tom Thumb"". You can google it. The only difference is you are using teh technique to make the head of teh bug, not the body. Its a little different for the bass fly but you'll figure it out.  -Dave"
