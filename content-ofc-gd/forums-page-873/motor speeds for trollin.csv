324149,white007,2009-03-30 21:39:00,16,Hey guys and gals i was wondering if anyone knows the maximum horsepower on a motor i can use without losing trolling abilitys. I am buying a used boat this year and i dont want to have to buy a kicker 9.9 just to troll with. If anyone can help i thank u very much in advance shaun
324152,Terry,2009-03-30 21:43:00,14456,"depends on the age and type of motor and prop, weight, size factors  I see people trolling nicely with a 300 hp 4 stroke"
324156,musky66,2009-03-30 21:47:00,273,"I have an aluminum Starcraft 17' side console with a Yamaha 115 4 stroke- no problem trolling for Walleye and Musky. Haven't had to but I could throw out a bucket or sock for a slower troll for 'eyes. I generally kick it up to about 900 rpm for 'Ski, and it runs at 700 rpm or so dead slow."
324157,glen,2009-03-30 21:51:00,2641,Help us out here a bit 007.  What are you fishing for?
324164,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-30 22:00:00,10439,"I have an 18 foot side console with Merc 90 horse 2 stroke and trolled Lake Ontario & Lake Huron for trout and salmon, Lake Erie for Walleyes, Pigeon for muskies.  Well you get the idea. It does depend alot on boat size and weight as well as hull design. What you want to troll for and with what boat/motor setup?"
324212,Pigeontroller,2009-03-30 23:59:00,2793,"I have a 16 foot alum. with a 90 4-stroke, I can troll down to about 2.2 mph, to get it any slower I have to trim it up, or throw out the buckets!"
324218,tomO,2009-03-31 00:15:00,363,When you guys throw out the buckets how far behind the boat do they trail?
324254,Kerry,2009-03-31 01:24:00,383,Tie off your buckets from the front cleats or rail if you have one about 4ft or so.That way you'll never get a line or rope caught in your prop.Plus it will be far enough away for netting a fish. Kerry
324314,white007,2009-03-31 03:40:00,16,"thanks for all your guys replies, and the main species i am fishing for is the guy u got in your hands glen. great pic"
324421,irishfield,2009-03-31 14:54:00,26272,"I troll for those with my 275, above idle, white007 !"
324475,outllaw,2009-03-31 17:34:00,1232,trolling plate 150.00
324570,glen,2009-03-31 21:56:00,2641,You should be able to troll for muskie with just about any motor.
324634,tomO,2009-03-31 23:54:00,363,THX kerry never thought about tieing them off the front lol. I've got a trolling plate works good in the lakes but I fish the river alot and if there's any current at all you really have to rev the engine up to move.
