Does anybody know how the fishing is on Tube Lake into Marion Lake, Kecil Lake and Lang Lake.  The resort is waterfalls lodge and just looking for a good place to take a family. Thanks for your help!"

I hear the lakes above it are great... wish I'd known that then... lol  Do a search.. pretty sure these lakes have been discussed before."
