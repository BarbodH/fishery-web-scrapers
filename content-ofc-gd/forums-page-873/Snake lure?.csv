324282,Angler16,2009-03-31 02:59:00,188,Hey all i was watching a video on youtube where a guy was using a top water replica snake? Do you think BPS would carry one of these or if you have one from somewhere else where can i get one? Thanks L.A
324285,steverowbotham,2009-03-31 03:00:00,1800,oh jeez... ask mike.
324286,Cudz,2009-03-31 03:02:00,2652,lol.  mike the bass fisher.  He knows.  I thought you two guys hung out together.
324290,Angler16,2009-03-31 03:11:00,188,No he lives in Oshawa and i live in brampton have not hung out just talk over msn and stuff but he wasnt on at the time so yeahh
324295,pike slayer,2009-03-31 03:16:00,1177,"last year there was an infommerical anout these rubber snakes for fishing and how they were soooo amazing for bass so my buddy ordered like $100. they were like 2feet long haha, my buddy tried them 2-3times and tossed them in the trash haha!!"
324303,kickingfrog,2009-03-31 03:28:00,8333,"Fish will eat snakes.  Snakes do swim.  However from a practical stand point a snake lure may be less effective than many other options. My big question would be the placement of hooks on a 10-plus inch lure intended for fish that may be only 2-3lb, and hooking percentages."
324306,ohhenrygsr,2009-03-31 03:32:00,947,When the Bass strikes at the lure let it eat it until it's about to poop it out then set the hook
324319,OhioFisherman,2009-03-31 04:06:00,6623,"A gimmick, they will eat a plastic lizard, plastic worm swum on the surface weightless at times too, and you can buy a bag of 8-10 lizards for 3-4 bucks."
324321,rbaquial,2009-03-31 04:09:00,968,"Yeah, BPS does carry then... Here's the link ... Also, go to  BassProfessor.Com  - he's supposedly the ""orginator"" of the snake lure... He's also got a few videos on that site, plus on youtube (just lookup Doug Hannon or Bass Professor)  Not too sure on how productive they would be (as others have mentioned; hookup percentage decreases) also... depending on where you are fishing - Do you think there would be snakes in the area?... just a few things to consider before purchasing...  You could do the same exact thing with a long enough Plastic Worm... Just hold the rod tip high while cranking in the lure... thus, keeping the ""snake swimming""..."
324347,MCTFisher9120,2009-03-31 11:04:00,3761,http://www.bassprofessor.com/elite/originalfishingsnake.php  I already got my next shipment in the mail  As said before they really do work. I caught a bunch of nice bass and a little pike last year on this great soft plastic topwater. If you can LA get some!
324371,BillM,2009-03-31 12:42:00,17367,Another gimmick like the Flying Lure?  lol
324375,Zebco,2009-03-31 12:48:00,123,"I caught many Bass on Flying lures, so many I used the whole kit about 10 yrs ago when they were popular."
324411,jjcanoe,2009-03-31 14:28:00,744,"I went to Florida when I was 15 with my family and came home with a Snake lure.  It had a hard hollow head with a hook built into it and you could add just about any type of larger sized plastic worm to it.  Pretty good design but not practical for the north with our ""smaller"" bass.  Last time I remember using it was when I cut the hook off and played with the cat in the backyard casting and reeling slowly and watching it stalk and pounce on the snake head. I was also gifted a box of ""flying lures"" when I was a bit older.  They sat around unopened for about 7 years before I finally figured out that they were great for Pike fishing. The ""flying ""action looked real yummy to the pike around here and they would just smack them on the drop when everything else including minnows didn't seem to work.   They are probably one of the first tube jigs I ever used.  jjcanoe"
324426,richyb,2009-03-31 14:58:00,774,"  I got my biggest bass on a flying lure, close to 8 pounds.  ofcourse not many other fish but ill give credit where credit is due"
