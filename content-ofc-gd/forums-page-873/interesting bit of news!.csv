324230,pike slayer,2009-03-31 00:41:00,1177,just looked on the mnr site and heres the full story on there!  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Newsroom/LatestNews/268465.html
324231,Guest skeeter99,2009-03-31 00:43:00,0,they are doing this with other FMZ's also  remmber 2 years ago  the toolkits the MNR had and were talking about  well now they are going to use that data plus other to make changes
324237,pike slayer,2009-03-31 00:58:00,1177,in their plan they are going to change the limit to 2 lake trout and only 1 over 40cm and 1 fish in high pressured areas. and their proposed idea that isn't passed yet is to change winter angling to feb.15 and brook trout are also next on the chopping block and will probably follow suit in the future.
324267,timmeh,2009-03-31 02:29:00,609,"I think it's fantastic that they take public opinion into account. Local guides and those who spend a lot of time fishing selected areas often have valuable knowledge about the state of those fisheries, and it's good for the MNR to tap into that knowledge."

324326,fishboy,2009-03-31 04:28:00,550,"I'm already used to a 2 fish laker limit with a slot & 1 line through the ice, so this doesn't seem ""out there""."
