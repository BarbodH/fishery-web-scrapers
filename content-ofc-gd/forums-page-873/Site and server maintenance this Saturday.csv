We will be optimizing the database and recounting and rebuilding site posts, members, etc. So our post and member count will drop to its correct level. Deleted posts and members numbers don't get dumped out of the database untill we do such a thing. Also attachments not viewed in more than 3 months will be removed..I think 3 months is appropriate. Anyone objecting is free to say so. We will attempt also to procure more resources for busy days and set things up to give preference to out MySQL server."
324920,GBW,2009-04-01 16:04:00,8460,thanks for the heads up Rick.
324936,TJQ,2009-04-01 16:24:00,7806,Ya.... what he said????
324937,Governator,2009-04-01 16:27:00,879,"If you have the server space, I'd keep the images up longer than 6 months+.  There are many times where we search for past posts to show off a fish like a ""blue pike"" or somethign that was posted in the past."
324939,bigfish1965,2009-04-01 16:31:00,3382,"It only applies to attached images...not ones posted by URL. Our disc space is now over 60% of capacity, so I would like it to be around 40%. I'll see how much we lose by optimizing and doing up the database first....I know our database is around 30 GB. Hope I never have to do a back up..that will wipe out my transfer from my ISP for the month..lol."
