323955,solopaddler,2009-03-30 09:52:00,8605,Excellent fish!  (Keep posting night reports and in no time at all you'll have the day shift all to yourselves LOL!)
324112,fishnsled,2009-03-30 20:14:00,3520,    Way to go on the PB Carole!!   Nice to see you two having your normal success with the evening fishing.
324145,drwxr,2009-03-30 21:31:00,453,"wow, looks like you guys been on the mission lately, nice fish. how do you see your float at night?"

324704,Mike the Pike,2009-04-01 02:31:00,3421,Very nice fish folks.congrats on yer PB Carole.
323453,ccmtcanada,2009-03-29 03:54:00,7971,"Well, after our success earlier in the week, we decided that we'd head out again tonight.  The conditions were about the same...pretty good visibility, waters a little faster than normal, but we had a pretty good feeling about it.  We started drifting for a bit and it didn't seem like anything was around.  Bly had some line tangle issues and was trying to fix that when my float when down....FAST!   I set the hook and this fish went crazy!!!  It swam to the other side of the bank in about 2 seconds...jumped high into the air and then came straight at me like a bullet!  It jumped again close to the bank and I thought the fight was over.  It looked like it was going to jump right out of the water and on the bank.  But it quickly recovered and jumped yet again in the middle of the pool.  Finally, I was able to bring it in nice and easy.  Anyhow, here's an entry to team 10...a 32.5"" steelhead.   After that was done, we got Bly's line issues resolved, I had a break off and had to re-tie.  Don't you know it, she says fish on and she's fighting a monster as well!  This one looked like it was going to take a bee line to the next pool down stream, but she expertly turned the fish around...managed to avoid a bunch of rocks and brought it closer.  Here's a pic near the end of the fight.   She lands her new personal best Steelhead, coming in at 32"" even and weighing about 12 to 13 pounds!!  Another entry for team 1 in the tourney.   I landed another smaller 18"" fish, but didn't bother with a picture.  All in all, 2 hours on a nice warm spring night...cant beat it...especially when there's fish involved."
323455,MarcusDiGiovanni,2009-03-29 03:56:00,182,Nice report
323456,snag,2009-03-29 04:00:00,1932,"Those signs look tasty,  How 'bout some ""humble pie"" when we cccccccccrush your team?     Aside from fierce competition,   WELL DONE!!!!"
323483,Greencoachdog,2009-03-29 04:34:00,8163,"All I can say is... Epic!!!  Congrats to bly on her new PB!!!  *Cliffs fish... not so much*    ... but... but, doesnt that mean you'll have to actually enter a fish???"
323488,GBW,2009-03-29 04:42:00,8460,"Wow, C & C you 2 are rocking the rivers!  good on ya!"
323507,mattyk,2009-03-29 11:05:00,2110,some great looking fish!
323509,canadian_copper,2009-03-29 11:10:00,925,BEAUTY FISH GUYS!!! GLAD TO SEE YA OUT TOGETHER!!
323513,Spiel,2009-03-29 11:22:00,9065,
323527,Streamerguy,2009-03-29 12:14:00,121,"WOW ...couple of great nights out guys,Congrats  I like the action shot of Bly fighting that fish,great stuff.  May I ask what the bait of choice was in the dark?  Again great couple of reports coming from the both of you,keepem comin    cheers Streamerguy "
323531,ccmtcanada,2009-03-29 12:20:00,7971, Hmmm....and your team has now many fish entered???   Well...seems to be bigger than any fish you've caught...   Hey Spiel...who's team are you on?  You're not supposed to make fun of your own captain!!   Roe....as stinky as you can get it!  It's all about scent at night.
323533,Spiel,2009-03-29 12:22:00,9065," Well Cliff, unitl I actually get out fishing I'm more like an anchor than a contributing team member."
323573,BillM,2009-03-29 13:27:00,17367,"Cliff, sounds like the bags of death are working out well for you  :)"
323577,Bernie,2009-03-29 13:33:00,3190,Well done! You two never cease to amaze me. Next time you come here to fish you have to bring Carole. You only catch them when she's around.
323584,Cudz,2009-03-29 13:46:00,2652,WOW!! Those are some sick looking fish. (A good sick)
323626,SlowPoke,2009-03-29 15:36:00,2984,Nice report guys! -Brian
323628,tjsa,2009-03-29 15:41:00,1578,"Well done Cliff and Carole, PB's are always great."
323646,The Urban Fisherman,2009-03-29 16:04:00,2050,"wow - awesome fish for both of you!  How do you see your floats in those conditions?  cheers, Uf"
323647,MJL,2009-03-29 16:05:00,2427,"Holy mother of chrome...Another report?  Congrats Carole on the new PB  I had a similar experience this past week on hitting size VS numbers.  Always seems surreal when you hit a pod of behemoths.  I'm guessing night-time steelheading is on Victor's mind now...He got into his first steelhead on the float set-up yesterday but couldn't land it.  Hey Vic, how about working 9-5 and fishing 5-9 this week?...I'll be up for it"
323650,kerr,2009-03-29 16:07:00,77,i cant believe u guys are hitttin them so good at night that rocks nice fish
323651,TJQ,2009-03-29 16:07:00,7806,Very well done!!
323688,Joeytier,2009-03-29 16:53:00,3990,Great stuff!  Two giant fish.
323713,ccmtcanada,2009-03-29 17:49:00,7971,"I should...I didn't catch anything up there without her....LOL.   We use those glow sticks...put them on top of the floats...when you don't see them anymore it's time to set the hook...LOL.   Thanks...most nights it's a bust.  More challenging as you can't see what your line is doing, but it can be done with practice."
323745,Joey,2009-03-29 19:45:00,9122,"That's a MONSTER Bly, way to go.  Well done  Joey"
323747,msp,2009-03-29 19:56:00,1336,Thanks for the report. Those are some good sized steelies. It seems that the larger fish seem to enter the rivers last as a general rule. No crowds at that time. You guys seem to be on fire.
323907,Leecher,2009-03-30 02:19:00,7832,Man you guys sure got them steels dialed in    Got to love the night time bite!! Congratulations to bly's PB  and thanks for sharing Keep up the good work!! Leechman
