324562,ShaunB,2009-03-31 21:41:00,73,I had a buddy pull one out of the credit in early august.  Probably in the 7-10pound range
324578,GoneFishin,2009-03-31 22:06:00,349," Did they stock Atlantic Salmon that big? I can't remember..  You would think with all the stocking they did at least a couple would show up. I've heard of a bunch of them being caught off Oshawa Pier in August which didn't make much scene since they didn't stock Oshawa creek. Any ways they ended up being Brown trout, since they were so silver people were thinking they were catching Atlantics. We'll see maybe some people here have caught a few..."

324593,kemper,2009-03-31 22:41:00,2232," DAWG!  We have been over this, come on.  Thats clearly a brown...I can tell by the shape of its third index tooth."
324622,douG,2009-03-31 23:39:00,2693,"I agree with Kemper, for what that is worth.  Still a fine feesh, Glen.  Thanks for that.  I guess."
324688,outdoorguy61,2009-04-01 01:54:00,220,"I have observed one in a creek east of Coburg. Note this was in the water and could be brought into question. This was about 9 years ago, before the larger program now undertaken.  I am hopeful this program will bear fruit in years to come, given the Atlantics historic significance combined with its ability to do repeat spawning runs.  outdoorguy61"

324750,CLofchik,2009-04-01 03:34:00,854,"  Fortino's, $6.99/lb    BTW--You can keep one Atlantic from the lake (25""+), but any caught in the tribs is C&R only."
