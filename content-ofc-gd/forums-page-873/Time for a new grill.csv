319332,lookinforwalleye,2009-03-19 21:43:00,4399,I have thrown my share of 200 dollar BBQ`s away so last summer I bought a Vermont Castings Q with no regrets.
319334,Dutch,2009-03-19 22:01:00,831,"I took the plunge and spent good dough on a Broil King last year - XLS90, it's real big, bigger than I need actually, but it had all the features I wanted at the right price point.  A must for me was 100% Stainless Grills and this beast has 3/8"" beauties.  There aren't many brands that actually have SS grills - I looked at porcelain coated cast iron and regular cast iron as well, they are somewhat prone to cracking and rusting if the coating cracks, so that's why I wanted SS.  In my reaserch I found that Napoleon, Weber and BK were consistantly rated very well.  Stay away from no-name brands, you'll replace every 2 years and won't ever get even heat.  HD and CTC sell brands of Napoleon and Weber, but they are NOT the same as you buy at speciality BBQ stores.  They are made for Big Box and some of the parts are inferior.  As for Vermont Castings - their parent company is in Bankruptcy as have the last 3-4 companies that have owned that NAME.  There is a lot of Value in the NAME, but stay away from the BBQ's, they are now made in China and are no-where near what they were 10-15 years and 4-5 owners ago."

319933,Garry2Rs,2009-03-21 12:42:00,1425,"About three years ago a buddy of mine, who is a amateur gourmet chef, bought a ceramic charcoal grill called ""The Big Green Egg""  It is an odd looking thing, that uses very little charcoal to quickly reach high temperatures.  There are ducts and flues to control the air flow, thus the heat.  When he closes all these vents, the fire is choked out.  The unburnt fuel can be used next time.  This is a high end product lined with fire brick and he swears by it."

321192,Headhunter,2009-03-24 13:12:00,5703,"Here's my 2 cents! I BBQ probably 100 to 150 days a year, you name it, I do it one the BBQ. About 9 years ago, I got tired of replacing burners in my cheap Broil Mate. I did some research and found that one of the keys to a good BBQ is it's abilty to provide steady, consistant and even heat across the grill. I bought a Vermont Castings  and am still running it today. The BBQ is virtually all porceline enamelled, the grills, cover and body. The grills themselves are cast iron coated with porcelin... I have never had and cracking, flaking etc... and I cook all year round. Like anything you buy, by in large, you get what you pay for. Quality parts cost more, it's pretty simple. The Big Green Egg is an awesome cooking machine, but it requires a lot of planning as like any charcoal burner, it takes time. One should also consider the warranty available on your next BBQ. My brother bought a Napoleon grill 12 years ago. About two years ago, he had a leaky burner. He called the shop he bought it at and they said they would send someone over to take a look... now remember, this was 9 or 10 years AFTER HE BOUGHT IT. He came home from work a few days later and noticed his BBQ wasn't where he left it... took a look and what did he find... the repair guy have replaced the burner, cleaned up the whole BBQ and no bill! That's service folks and you can be sure that the next BBQ he buys will be a Naploeon. Ducane makes a fabulous grill, they are just hard to find. I see there are many Weber fans here, personally, I won't have one! For the price, I can do much better with a Napoleon. Webers feel cheap to me, flimsy, thin metal and just plain cheap. Remember the key to a great grill is heat retention and I just can't see that happening with their thin cheap metal. IMHO! I wouldn't buy a BBQ without a side burner and I won't buy a BBQ that isn't natural gas. Many above have already mentioned the pain of propane tanks. My V.C has a side burner (corn in the summer!!!!), an infrared rotiseriery (sp) back burner and an ""overn"" burner. All have their applications, all get their use... don't discount anything, until you have tried it! Good luck... but think NAPOLEON! HH"
321204,Lunker777,2009-03-24 13:32:00,866," Good call !! I used to work at the Depot selling BBQ's and the Ducane was the only one I felt comfortable selling to someone LOOKING for a stainless steel grill. Easy way to test is take a magnet and place it on the metal... If it sticks to the so called ""stainless"" then obviously, its NOT true stianless. I stold a Ducane to a friend of mines family about 4 yrs ago, and they love it . Being 23 yrs old, I dont have the $$$ to go out and buy a $1000 grill hahah so I just opted for my trusty John Deere BBQ I bought at the shop here ( where I work ). I bought the cheapo one as it was all I could afford. I bbq all year and next time around, I will be going for something with a little more heavy duty parts.... IE... Cast grills or stainless..."

I put grill marks and cook steaks just fine on my dilapitated.. run over by my youngest daughter (with the Sierra) $99 CTC special propane BBQ. I think the fancy mega BBQ's do nothing but impress the neighbours (and drain your bank account)... but since my closest is 1800 feet away.. I'll stick with old faithfull !   
323770,JohnF,2009-03-29 20:59:00,3494,"So, at the risk of sounding like the compleat consumer and forgeting about price, what's the very best BBQ to buy in Ontario these days, bar none? I do all the family cooking. My kitchen stove cost over $3,000 but I still do most of my cooking outdoors. It's only logical that the BBQ should be my bigger investment. My current unit is a Beefeater made in Australia but I'm not knocked out by it. It's ok but I think it could be a lot better for $700+. I'd be happy to lay out more if the durned thing would give me what I want (even heat distribution, rust resistance, etc)  I really like the charcoal idea for flavour, but I use the BBQ way too much to wait for coals to prep for cooking every day. What I want in a unit is even heat distribution, corrosion resistance in the burners, grilles and drip tray, natural gas burners, a good igniter (or no igniter at all), some kind of insulation and a deflector for slow cooking, a decent rotisserie, perhaps even a smoker option if that's not asking too much.  Mebbe we need to put our heads (and money) together and develop a really good BBQ for these northern climes. Surely we have the skills, equipment, and expertise to match with our BBQing experience and expectations to build the better (best?) BBQ. I can see a dual fuel unit that will work on gas or charcoal depending on how much time you have to play. A smoker option isn't out of the question either.  Any inventive (and inclined to metal fabrication) souls out there ready for the challenge? I have a neighbour who'd probably do the welding. I'm sure he could weld marshmallows to Walleyes if need be (he does tricksy welding for aerospace engineering) and he loves to cook in the back yard (as long as beer is involved).  Send me your thoughts. I'd be willing to spend a little money to have him weld up some of them to see if they work.  Of course buying the best BBQ would be much simpler but so far I haven't found the perfect one.  JF"
323771,JohnF,2009-03-29 21:02:00,3494, Having burned out quite a bunch I'm inclined to agree with you. I used to just drill out the holes in the burners on my cheapos (to even up the heat) until they would drill no more. Or until the bottom of the unit collapsed. Mayhap we should just buy cheapies and replace 'em every few years.  JF
323777,irishfield,2009-03-29 21:09:00,26272,For sure John... I think the one at the back door is 10 years old or more..has some cement blocks holding it upright.. burner has flames coming from places it shouldn't.. but cooks fine if you know where to place the meat! lol  I'd rather spend the money on fishing gear and boat accessories... but to each their own! lol
323842,pigeonfisher,2009-03-30 00:13:00,696,"John,  Head over to the Napoleon store in Orillia.  You won't be dissapointed.  If nothing else, forget about buying a grill.  Just go for the education."
323979,Headhunter,2009-03-30 13:05:00,5703,"John, As I mentioned in my earlier post, consider the Napoeon and a huge plus 1 to what Pidgeonfisher said... My Vermont castings , approaching 10 years old still functions as it did day one. The ignitor still works, BBQ fires up first click. None of my burners leak, period. I can use the whole grill, I don't have to seek out hot or cold spots. It's big enough that I can feed 20 to 30 people at a time, but has consistant and even heat throughout the grill. It's expensive, but as Wayne mentioned, it's not the sort of thign everybody needs... if you only BBQ a few times a month, buy a cheapie, but you already mentioned that you BBQ alot, so the investment is worth it. Once you have ruined a few me3als, you'll see the advantage of a premium grill. Again, Napoleon, Ducane are two I highly recommend. I wandered through a Napoleon dealer on the weekend... some really nice grills in the $1500.00 to $2000.00 range... and be sure to check out the warranty they provide on the burners etc... HH"

319151,Jer,2009-03-19 11:43:00,1426,"Well my old Broil-Mate BBQ is finally on its last legs and I'm in the market for a new grill.  I wanna go with a bit better quality this time and was wondering if anybody had any recommendations.  I'm leaning toward a 3-burner, 450 square inch Napoleon grill I've seen at several dealers: Prestige 450. The going price seems to be about $800 (with most throwing in assembly, cover, cook-book, etc,). Extras such as side burners, rear rotiserie burners and such aren't such a big deal to me. I'd rather quality and longevity over all the bells & whistles.  Canadian Tire has a ""Ted Reader"" Signature Series grill by Napoleon that is a similiar size but includes the rear burner for about the same price. According to other Napoleon dealers, this unit is a Chinese-made model rather than made in Barrie as most other models are. Looking at it, it's hard to tell any difference in quality. All the Napoleon grills I've looked at (chinese or not) are of far superior construction (material & assembly) than most other grills on the market, save Weber.  To be honest, $800 is more than I would like to spend, and there is a better chance the CT unit will go on sale at some point in the next few weeks (the dealer prices are pretty well set for the year).  I guess it comes down to the classic: buy Canadian (as I would really like to) or: how much can I save on that off-shore stuff?  Maybe the question should be: Why can't Ted Reader put his damn name on a Canadian made grill?"
319156,John,2009-03-19 12:09:00,2956,"My father in law was in the BBQ (Gas Grill) business for over 25 years and the only thing that I can tell you Jer is that most of the imports that CT, HD etc sell are practically impossible to get parts for. They would send their customers to him for parts that didn't exist just to get the monkey off their backs. If you are going to buy an import (meaning China) buy something relatively simple, without all of the back burners and broilers and side burners and infra-red, where all that you will need to replace is burner and grills. In most cases burners can be modified to fit safely and generic grills that can be cut to size can be purchased at most hardware stores. If you want a higher end unit go to a dealer and ask about parts for that particular unit."
319158,alexmedic,2009-03-19 12:13:00,186,"I have owned a Weber Genesis Gold for the last 3 years and love it. It was just shy of a $1000.00 dollars, but it is kinda like owning a high end appliance - you get what you pay for.  The beauty of Weber/Napoleon is that the BTU's are much less, because it cooks much more even.  Lower end BBQ's have much higher BTU's to compensate for the corners that need more to heat up.  As far as Canadian/China, that's a tough one.  I'd personally go with my gut.  I remember when I first considered buying an expensive BBQ, it was a hard pill to swallow.  Now that I own one, I could not think of anything else..."

319172,Radnine,2009-03-19 12:43:00,1538," You have a point there Woodsy. I do all sorts of ""indirect cooking"" on my Weber which essentially means using your BBQ as an outdoor oven. When I smell the lighter fluid and the charcoal my senses send me back to childhood, and I love it. That being said, I am not well organized enough to use an old-fashioned type of que. More power to you though We own a Weber that we paid about $800 for about 8 years ago and have not put a nickle into it since. It cooks like a dream (well, I cook like a dream, it just sits there) and is showing no signs of slowing down. Bar-B-Ques are one of the few remaining things that are made in Canada (I think my Weber was made in the States) and you raise a valid concern about patriotic buying vs. taking money off the family table. I am sort of playing the same thing out with the rod that I want to buy. Do I save about $25 on the St. Croix Triumph (made in China) or buy the Premier (more or less same rod different country of manufacture). It might be time for those that can, to man up and buy local where possible. In the end really, patriotic buying may be the only control we have over our situation. Thus endith the sermon. Jim"

To keep up with competition Napleon started manufacturing in China a number of years ago.  The ones at Canadian Tire are actually imported BBQ's made to the same specs as the canadian models, if I remember right.  You can get some good deals at th Napoleon store!"
319186,John,2009-03-19 13:18:00,2956," I know that there is many schools of thought on this but IMHO charcoal adds no flavour to the food that is being grilled. It is basically carbon. Some professionals use hardwood..........fruitwoods, mesquite, maple, hickory, which does. Most of the flavour that we all love comes from the caramelization of the sugars in the food and the smoke that is generated from fat and juices being vapourized."
319191,fishingisliving,2009-03-19 13:29:00,170,"I am in the same place right now. My grill is only 5 years old and paid 600$ for it. But I think I grill a lot, I use 5-6 BBQ tanks a summer and another 1-2 in the winter. (I think the winter use has put my BBQ in early retirement, something to do with drastic temperature variations, from really hot to really cold and vice versa)  One thing I do not want to pick up is porcelain grill with low quality burners. The second you get a crack in the burner your flames get messy and your heat becomes uneven. And my porcelain grill cracked after the third winter season. Anyway, maybe it's just not ment to be used that way. But I was talking to a chef in an upscale steak house and he was suggesting I pick up stainless grill, or cast iron.  I would say, regardless if you spend 400 or 2000$, I would put the money in quality, not quantity.  Get a good quality grill, quality burners that are distributed evenly to ensure proper heat distribution accross your cooking platform and allows you to control and have mild-low heat on one side and searing heat on the other, and nevermind the side burners and other accessories. just my opinion."

What you have to be aware of though is that the parent corp of Vermont Casting declared bankruptcy last year - if you get a fancy one you may have some difficulty getting parts.  The one I bought was the plane jane 3 burner unit (made in Canada) - but for $275 I think I got a great unit - and the only parts of significance I,m worried about can be replaced with generic stuff easiy enough.  When I compared what $275 got me in other units this one was head an shoulders above the rest.  I think HD is trying to get rid of them also."

When I took it apart, it was a cracked valve/hose/regulator at the temperature control...took pictures and still Thermos wouldn't do anything but take my money for a replacement part....$65 US.  By this time, it was getting into winter so waited to put it in...finally did, lit it up and same problem...leaking VHR port on the brand new part...called and since I waited to put it in, they wouldn't replace it under warranty. Even though I could show it wasn't used (no burn marks, or discolouration), they denied me. As soon as I turned the gas on, it would leak out the temp. knob.  Also, the pictures I took showed that the flames went over and surrounded the lid so again, they said ""Grease Fire"" cause apparenlty, only grease will cause it to go on fire like that...yeah, right!  It was a good thing my wife went outside to get something at the time...she saw the fire before it lit up the deck, fence and tree that seperates the neighbours house. Man did that sucker go!  I talked to the fire dept....they saw the part and agreed it was defective but I live in a township where it's volunteer so neither they nor the City's dept. could do anything for me.  ...finally gave up and am about to buy a new one myself.

319304,legacey,2009-03-19 20:08:00,127,"I still use a cheap charcoal grill for the flavour. I did get a bit aprehensive, after I read this....  One pound of charcoal barbecue steak contains as much carcinogens (cancer forming agent) as the smoke in 15 cigarettes. The dripping fat on the charcoal causes a chemical substance called a benzopyrene to be released and is found in the black coating on the meat. Wrap the meat in foil for protection.  http://www.bellybytes.com/foodfacts/meat_food_facts.html  But then I figured I do too many bad things for my body already so one more thing won't be all that bad.
