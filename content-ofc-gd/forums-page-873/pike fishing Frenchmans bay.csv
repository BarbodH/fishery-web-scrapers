323801,fish-miester,2009-03-29 22:46:00,864,Was wondering if its open right now ? just double checking before i go !?
323805,Laker272,2009-03-29 22:52:00,45,The west side is open for sure. There is some ice hanging around the middle still. I saw a boat fishing it while I was casting on Thursday.
323806,fish-miester,2009-03-29 22:54:00,864,"oh alright , good to know thanks , I'v heard its open and that pike were being caught , but was confused about the regs ,  what are they hitting ?"
323812,Laker272,2009-03-29 23:05:00,45,"I've heard most were caught using large minnows with a float. I only use live bait on the ice, so i haven't tried them. Casting with firetiger and perch pattern in a 10 - 12 sized suspender slowly has also seen results."
323878,msp,2009-03-30 01:36:00,1336,Dont forget that pike is closed on Lake Ontario in April.
323885,douG,2009-03-30 01:43:00,2693,"TrooDat, msp, we have only until sundown on Tuesday to catch that Toronto waterfront pike.  I was out Thursday, Saturday and today too, with only one follow.  I suck at fishing."
323890,CLofchik,2009-03-30 01:47:00,854,Pike closes on the 31st.
323931,fish-miester,2009-03-30 03:48:00,864,"ya thats why i wanna get out there and do as much fishing for the next 2 days or so ,  any good spots around Durham for pike?"
323988,Joeytier,2009-03-30 13:35:00,3990,Frenchman's Bay is 100% open.  I'd say that's your best bet for pike in the east GTA.
324135,fishermccann,2009-03-30 21:11:00,655,For 2 days!!!!
324466,ehg,2009-03-31 17:18:00,2666,"Really one of your best spots for pike at this time, too bad there is only this afternoon and evening left until pike season closes."
