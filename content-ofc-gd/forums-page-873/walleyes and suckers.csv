323795,Ron,2009-03-29 22:23:00,1683,"Was up in Orillia, the Talbot, Beaverton, Pefferlaw and Sibbald Point yesterday. Open water in the narrows. Suckers running the Talbot and Beaverton. Nothing to be found at the Pefferlaw. Boyz still ice fishing at Sibbald. Pretty sure it's their last day on the ice."
323847,tinbanger,2009-03-30 00:36:00,1028,haven't seen the suckers in the creek behind our place yet . first one caught last year was April 12.  TB
323870,Bly,2009-03-30 01:23:00,1556,Caught one last weekend in the East.  I was thinking it was just a real early one but then I caught a few more later in the week.
323960,fishboy,2009-03-30 10:53:00,550,sounds promising for some spring action
323998,fishermccann,2009-03-30 14:09:00,655,Lots of suckers being caught in the Rouge River.
324368,OX!,2009-03-31 12:31:00,6,Yea plenty o fat suckers in the Rouge right now! Also a crap load of lazy brown bullheads =)
324442,Weekend Warrior,2009-03-31 15:49:00,27,We were out on a Durham area creek on the weekend and the suckers were hitting the bottom of our boat while we were going down. They were all over! Also talked to an old guy who claims to have caught a Walleye. I cant confirm that one though - it sounded a bit weird to me.
