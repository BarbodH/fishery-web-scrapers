1053927,Headhunter,2019-12-20 15:30:00,5703,"Saw this on the news the other day. With limited range, around 150km per charge, I can see outfitters re-fitting their Beavers and use these on their short haul flights. It's going to make that dash to the dock on out day a little tougher as you won't hear the Beaver coming until it's on you! https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/electric-seaplane-float-plane-test-flight-harbour-air-1.5390816 HH"
1053928,irishfield,2019-12-20 15:45:00,26272,"Prop noise is still there, just won't hear it chugging along taxing. Nothing you'll need to worry about Joe, as you won't be riding in one in your lifetime. Everyone thought the test flight was done fairly light, but he was almost at gross weight with just him and the batteries!"
1053929,Terry,2019-12-20 16:36:00,14456,An electric beaver  that‚Äôs what we all need
1053931,dave524,2019-12-20 17:04:00,4508,"I suspected the payload would be very low with the weight of the batteries and what do you do when it is on a remote lake without enough charge to get back to base, plug it into a currant bush ?"
1053933,Whopper,2019-12-20 18:02:00,2174,Quite shocking Terry¬†üòÅ Hmmm. I've never wired a beaver before
1053934,Fisherman,2019-12-20 18:04:00,7201,"Well they're like those phones that have wireless charging, on the beaver you just install the vibrator pad. "
1053935,Fisherman,2019-12-20 18:04:00,7201,Sure hope it has a loooong glide capability.
1053936,Headhunter,2019-12-20 18:17:00,5703,"I saw that as well Wayne. Your probably correct about them not being readily available for some time, but if we look at the advancements in vehicle technology, things are moving pretty fast. It's start! BTW - I think I prefer a passive beaver vs electric! I aint gettin any younger! HH"
1053937,Whopper,2019-12-20 18:49:00,2174,Joe the electric might help with stimulus
1053940,BillM,2019-12-20 21:36:00,17367,'Sorry boys we can't bring that extra few cases of beer or else I won't get home'  
1053943,craigdritchie,2019-12-20 22:47:00,1586,"Don't bet on it. That 150 km range means perhaps a half hour of flying time in the E-Beaver before you run out of juice. Then it sits on a charger for how long? Float planes don't earn their keep when they're tied up to the dock. By comparison, a standard gas Beaver has a range of around 700 km and can be refuelled in a couple of minutes. Headhunter is right, it's a start, but it's going to be a long time before this becomes truly practical or economically viable."
1053944,LeXXington,2019-12-21 01:52:00,1928,That sounds scary if i meet one in the fog again üò≤
