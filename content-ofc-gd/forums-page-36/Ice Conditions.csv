I won‚Äôt be venturing anywhere that I typically go later in the season. I‚Äôll be staying close to home."
1053945,AKRISONER,2019-12-21 01:59:00,5558,4-4.5 inches of solid black ice. Not too much snow. You should be good to go walking. Supposed to be a bit warm for a couple of days here so be careful in areas with potential inflow from melt off
1053949,Locnar,2019-12-21 04:25:00,645,Any idea if any of the smaller lakes in the minden/haliburton area are gettin' into safe ice conditions? I've heard reports of some people going out on a couple of them.
1053952,porkpie,2019-12-21 14:52:00,2521,"I was out on what Is in my opinion ‚Äúsafe ice‚Äù last Monday on a southern Ontario lake. ¬†There will be some safe ice in many areas of many lakes all across Ontario now. ¬†But not all areas of all lakes. ¬†The trick is that you or someone you have faith in needs to know what‚Äôs up. ¬†That‚Äôs experience gained only by getting out there and doing it. ¬†No one can tell you that Ice is absolutely safe, especially as a lot of larger waterbodies just started freeze up in the last week. "
1053961,Jds63,2019-12-21 18:00:00,1365,"just flooded our ice rink on the lake up in Haliburton for¬†the third time this week , 5 inches so far"
1053962,Eserf,2019-12-21 18:57:00,15,What methods do you use to flood? Just spray water or do you have a makeshift zamboni system?
1053963,Jds63,2019-12-21 20:04:00,1365,"i drill a hole with an auger and drop down a sump pump, attach to a small length of hose , and fill a big clam sled full of water , drag it across¬†and dump it ,.. it‚Äôs a lot of work .. my pump is not strong enough to hook a long hose and spray ... my friend picked up a gas powered pump and fire hose ... that is the way to go .. done in 2 minutes .. always do in the evening so night temps really set up the ice ... it‚Äôs still a learning process , i hope to have a better method next winter .. are you also doing a rink ?"
1053968,Eserf,2019-12-21 21:43:00,15,We make a rink every year for the last three years. We rent as a group once per winter for four days. We have a big group of guys so we make quick work of clearing the snow. Then we start a flood by using the auger to draw up water from the whole. This year i have a pump that uses the power from the drill to spin the turbine. Hope that doesnt freeze up but worth a shot.
1053972,AKRISONER,2019-12-21 23:01:00,5558,Every time I‚Äôve used a sump pump I end up getting shale ice...any ideas? Maybe it‚Äôs just too cold when I‚Äôve tried it causing the ice to not freeze nicely? My solution has been the extremely labour intense process of hauling buckets of hot water down to the lake and pre filling in the cracks that form with snow. Then running around with a puck and packing slush into the ruts. It at least patched up the bad areas and cracks but I‚Äôve never had luck straight up flooding the ice? Maybe I need more/less water? any ideal temperature? Tips? I plan on making a rink on Thursday
1054194,Eserf,2019-12-27 20:03:00,15,"Ice was great over Christmas even saw a couple snowmobiles out. Did catch anything but still tried. We also made a really nice rink. I got up to 8"" in some spots. It got warm Over the last two days with some rain so a decent amount of melt but before that was nice  "
1054195,Eserf,2019-12-27 20:05:00,15,Used a drill pump. Worked pretty decent i must say. I have a bunch of batteries so wasn't a problem. Just wish i zip tied the trigger to give my finger a break
1053650,Eserf,2019-12-12 21:15:00,15,"Hey there, I'm new to the community. I will be staying¬†at a cottage on Whitestone Lake over Christmas and hope to have suitable ice to fish with a group. This is a yearly tradition however we are new to the cottage and lake. Main question is how are the ice conditions in the area right now. With two weeks until we go it can only get thicker so I'm trying to see what the worst case would be (current conditions). Anyone been inthe area lately¬†(near Perry Sound,¬†Whitestone, Dunchurch)? we take ice safety seriously I normally go out there with one other guy on foot and auger some holes to take a measurement of the thickness. In the last three years we have had good conditions for a full ice rink even¬†so I'm hopeful. Anyway if anyone know what the ice is looking like in that area (whitestone, perry sound, dunchurch) it would be greatly appreciated of you could share."
1053651,misfish,2019-12-12 21:46:00,29133,Do not know about the ice conditions . You can see if the Duck Rock restaurant is still open and give them a call. Say it is¬† (705) 389-3322 They are on the lake in Dunchurch. There is crappie in that lake.
1053652,BillM,2019-12-12 22:05:00,17367,I bet if it's got any ice at all it's extremely sketchy.¬† Definitely try and get a hold of someone local.¬† Temps just haven't gotten cold enough yet this year.
1053654,irishfield,2019-12-12 22:13:00,26272,50CM of snow last night might put a damper on that.. literally!
1053655,Eserf,2019-12-12 22:16:00,15,Thats a good suggestion thank you
1053657,Eserf,2019-12-12 22:17:00,15,I read that today unfortunate for sure hope it manages to firm up still
1053658,Eserf,2019-12-12 22:18:00,15,Thanks for the reply I'm going to follow up with a restaurant in the area hopefully they have something good to say
1053659,Old Ironmaker,2019-12-12 22:40:00,8243,"Ice conditions here where we live, the North shore of Lake Erie, are perfect. There isn't any. But there were days when I skied I wished for snow. One year I remember going down to Ellicott NY we had a foot of good base the last week of November. I happened to get a bad flu on the Mon and Tues of that week.¬† Same wishes for ice when when we hit the hardwater.¬† One of the best Xmas days we had here with the entire Family we had a good 6"" of ice. My brother and I walked¬† out 100 yards and got a nice bucket of Perch. It can't get much better than that. Maybe call the folks you rented from, they may have your answer. I hope you get your ice and regardless have a great Christmas and welcome to The Ontario Fishing Community Mr. or Miss Eserf. Tell us a bit about yourself."
1053661,AKRISONER,2019-12-13 00:22:00,5558,I live in pointe au baril. Ice is still extremely bad having only truly formed within the last week. That area got absolutely hammered with snow over the past two days. However the squalls were extremely localized. Pointe au baril didn‚Äôt get a lot of snow while areas to the south got dumped on. At best you may be able to tread cautiously on foot on very well known areas but any sort of motorized transport would be 100% out of the question. There is a cold snap due next week but with lots of snow on the ice it‚Äôs not going to help anything.
1053664,Eserf,2019-12-13 01:14:00,15,Staying optimistic. We would only be on foot anyway not like I'm asking for enough ice to have a sled out there. Might have something decent by Christmas. My name is Evan I live in Vaughan
1053665,Eserf,2019-12-13 01:16:00,15,One year was bad but we still managed to make a small skating area just off shore fishing was no good that year
1053673,KawarthaAngler,2019-12-13 16:24:00,273,"Guys have begun ice fishing on south Chemong Lake, just north of Peterborough."
1053760,Theguyfromupnorth,2019-12-15 04:59:00,1,"Dear Eserf from Vaughan, I currently reside in Sudbury,¬†but I‚Äôm spending Christmas with my wife family in Vaughan. Last time I was there I noticed a¬†body of water on centre street just west of Yonge. Wondering if you have ever fished that body of water before, and if it would be worth bringing my gear south with me. Also wondering if you can tell me what species reside in that lake. Please let me know ASAP Tight lines - Theguyfromupnorth"
1053767,porkpie,2019-12-15 14:34:00,2521,"Thats the mill pond in Richmond hill. ¬†When visiting my grandparents, gramps¬†would drive me down there as a little boy when my grandmother¬†went to the mall (smart man, he wasn‚Äôt getting stuck shopping)¬†We‚Äôd fish for panfish. ¬†You‚Äôd catch the occasional bass as well. ¬†No idea what if anything you can catch in there now but 40 plus years ago that‚Äôs all that was present."
1053783,Eserf,2019-12-16 05:36:00,15,Thats Oak bank pond. People have fished there I haven't I'm not sure whats in there but I've people fishing small pond in my area and they do catch small fish. Not sure if there is ice on the shore yet. I can have a look if I drive by that area tomorrow. There is a wood deck that you can cast off if there is no ice I think you should be good.
1053784,Eserf,2019-12-16 05:39:00,15,Mill pond is on mill street accessible from Bathurst north of major Mackenzie. I believe he was referring to oak bank pond on centre street west of young. Mill pond has nice skating in the winter when its frozen and people do fish it in the warmer months for small fish
1053789,NAW,2019-12-16 15:03:00,4022,"It most likely will be good by christmas.  I went for crappie yesterday and found the ice to be really sketchy.¬† It's a few weeks behind last year, if that helps.."
1053863,Smarty Pantz,2019-12-18 21:17:00,203,"Friend of mine there said he checked yesterday and was only about 3 inches. Hope it's good for you by Christmas. If I was home, I'd go out and check myself but in Quebec right now lol."
1053864,Eserf,2019-12-18 21:19:00,15,Thanks a lot I'm getting more excited by the day
1053866,Smarty Pantz,2019-12-18 21:34:00,203,I bet. Whitestone is a great lake for fishing. My friend said he checked the ice where the town dock is. Not too far from the duck rock¬†üòä
1053867,AKRISONER,2019-12-18 21:41:00,5558,"very very cold for the next couple of days, you guys will be good to go for walking by christmas. its currently -16 up there right now supposed to be -24 tonight. That will help a lot."
1053886,Big Cliff,2019-12-19 15:53:00,6899,I was down to Port Perry yesterday and Scugog looked to be frozen over (I AM NOT SAYING IT'S SAFE) but I didn't see any open water anywhere.
1053907,AKRISONER,2019-12-19 23:41:00,5558,I will be on the ice tomorrow afternoon and will provide you with an official measurement from pointe au baril
1053910,Big Cliff,2019-12-20 01:26:00,6899,Just be safe!
1053911,Eserf,2019-12-20 02:18:00,15,Thanks for that! And be safe like big cliff said
