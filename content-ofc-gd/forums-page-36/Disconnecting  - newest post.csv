Since I generally feel much better after one of these trips and do some of my best thinking it made me think of the health and wellness benefits of just getting out there and disconnecting Cheers Andrew"
1053981,Fisherman,2019-12-22 15:41:00,7201,"Have to heartily agree on disconnecting.  The insane amount of people you see walking around with phone in one hand and a pretty close second place is their favourite version of coffee.  Health sources forecast a large amount of people will suffer from phone thumb because of the amount of time swiping, it's not a natural action. Secondly and probably more severe will be the head/neck bent forward staring at the device,  another non natural position."

The only 2 people in the universe that have my number are my wife and daughter and everyone else knows if they want to contact me to call me at home. I've never texted and wouldn't even know how to do it. We go out for dinner every Friday night and even sometimes for breakfast thru the week and I'm amazed every time at the number of people talking on their phones in the restaurant rather than the people they're sitting with. We were out recently and the 4 people at  the next table almost never spoke to each other and spent the whole time texting to other people. I've lived a long time without a cell phone and don't intent to start anytime soon LOL"

1054008,gordy28,2019-12-23 14:22:00,638,"Thanks guys  - I definitely think its easy to get hooked on being constantly connected I think of my youngest daughter - basically all she has ever known is having access to ""everything"" at her fingertips.  its one of the big reasons I am hoping she inherits our love of the outdoors Thanks Mamona - yes - its been a grind but I feel better and my wallet is heavier!

1054024,pics,2019-12-23 20:06:00,1268,I totally disconnect on my trips to Greenstone and the only way I talk to home is through my OnStar calling feature in my truck.  It satisfies my wife's desire to know that I'm still alive...lol
