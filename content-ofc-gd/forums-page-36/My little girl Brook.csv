1054018,Spiel,2019-12-23 19:05:00,9065,Many of you here surely remember my little girl Brook from our Lakair adventures. 	Sadly a week ago today in the early evening hours (Dec 16) I had to rush her to a 24 hour emergency center to have her laid to rest. 	She had developed what was likely a sinus cancer that spread to her lungs.  	R.I.P my Angel Baby. 	June 30 2007 - December 16 - 2019.Â Â    	Shown here with me at Lakair in front of Joey and Paul's tent.
