1054357,lew,2019-12-31 19:14:00,12766,Happy New Year to everyone and in this house it'll be EXTREMELY happy A week ago my wife went for her regular mammogram and got a call the next day that something showed up on the xray that shouldn't be there and they scheduled more tests for yesterday. It's been a very tough week worrying about what it could be. We went yesterday for the tests and everything is fine and the spot that showed up was nothing more than a mark on the original picture. Very Happy New Year for this family for sure.
