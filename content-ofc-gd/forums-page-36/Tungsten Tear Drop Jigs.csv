1053891,NAW,2019-12-19 17:29:00,4022,I love using little micro jigs for crappie.  But man are they ever expensive.  Anyone know a good reputable place online to but them?  I'd like to by 30 or 40 so I don't have to worry about it for a long time.
1053892,misfish,2019-12-19 17:50:00,29133,Northland tackle had 20%  off til Dec 3.  https://www.northlandtackle.com/
1053897,OhioFisherman,2019-12-19 19:23:00,6623,I don't know how important tungsten is to you? but there are options? https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33032903108.html?spm=a2g0o.detail.1000014.19.4e15272dzYmsCN&gps-id=pcDetailBottomMoreOtherSeller&scm=1007.13338.146400.0&scm_id=1007.13338.146400.0&scm-url=1007.13338.146400.0&pvid=b0594ed9-bb7b-4a74-a0bc-90ccadb6d1e0
1053899,NAW,2019-12-19 19:39:00,4022,Those look like decent little jigs from Ali.  But the expected delivery is 40 to 60 days!  Yikes! 
1053900,OhioFisherman,2019-12-19 19:51:00,6623,"Some of the stuff on Ali gets here pretty quickly considering the distance, other things get shipped on the slow boat?"
1053997,Ron,2019-12-22 21:40:00,1683,My Nephew had them for sale at one time. They were sold in a micro jig box with 30 tungsten jigs. 3 different sizes. I will find out if he still has them. He can be found on Facebook under Gremlins jigs I think.
1053998,GBW,2019-12-23 01:07:00,8460,This guy?   https://www.facebook.com/pg/gremlinscustombaits/posts/?ref=page_internal
1053999,waki5,2019-12-23 01:47:00,34,"PoolThe link is me. Best to pm me from that page. I sell the kit for $60 or $70 shipped. Pick up can be in Whitby or Cobourg depending on my work schedule. Case is empty on the other side. Three different sizes. 6mm, 5mm, 3mm."
1054000,waki5,2019-12-23 01:59:00,34,Hopefully in the next two weeks I should have more options. These kits I will not break up. I sat down with 5 other anglers to put these colours and sizes together. Only 8 kits left. I will also have raw tungsten jigs in 5mm and 6mm for sale.
1054009,NAW,2019-12-23 15:06:00,4022,"I assume they come with the case and everything shown? Does the price include shipping as well?  I'm in Barrie.  if so, that's a great deal.  I'll have to track you down and maybe get in touch.  I got 6 jigs at Trembleys yesterday.  But it cost me 23 bucks.  I need them for tomorrow though, so I couldn't wait any longer."
1054013,Fang,2019-12-23 17:37:00,1330,"I just ordered a 25 pack unpainted 5mm of amazon.ca. They were $26.23 plus shipping. search tungsten shelt as that is the brand name of the jig Figured it would be a decent painting experiment and keep me busy over the holidays waiting for some ice. Last year I bought a few packs of tungsten fly beads from Sail, Cost me a bout $10 a pack for 25 beads. These can slip over the hook and are easy to epoxy to the back of the jig body so I just upgraded a bunch of the old lead heads I had already. Bought the 1/8 and 1/32 size to play with. Both seemed to work fine"
1054016,NAW,2019-12-23 18:36:00,4022,Thanks for the idea man!  Sounds decent.
1054054,waki5,2019-12-24 11:19:00,34,Hopefully in a week or two I'll have my order. I'll beat that price. I just need to wait for duty charges to figure out my final cost.
1054107,waki5,2019-12-25 18:54:00,34,The kit includes the case and is water tight. 70 bucks is shipped to your door
