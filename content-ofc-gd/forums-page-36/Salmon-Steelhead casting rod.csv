However, since this would be something new to me I was looking for some advice from fellow anglers. I will be casting spoons from 1/2oz to 3/4oz. I would also be looking to not ""break the bank"" since this would be something of trial and error for me. Thanks in advance!"

Never fished for or caught a salmon, but the waters you fish may play a part in the selection? The rods and reels I used here for bass also seemed to work fine for steelhead, but it was mostly open water fishing."
1054266,BillM,2019-12-29 22:39:00,17367,"I use the same rod for salmon and steelhead.Â  Anything in the 6-10lb range, 10'6 etc should work just fine."
