1054198,b_cdot,2019-12-28 00:38:00,270,"Anyone ever have a tire go flat, top it up then it doesn't leak? Just put some new bridgestones on about a month and a half ago. Any idea what could cause this?"
1054199,ketchenany,2019-12-28 00:41:00,3229,Rim leak that sealed !  Dan will  know for sure.
1054201,GBW,2019-12-28 02:16:00,8460,Put some soapy water near and on the valve stem and take the dust cap off when doing so and look for bubbles.  I see more leaks there when it's not a nail/screw in the tire in most cases.
1054202,Weeds,2019-12-28 02:19:00,782,Did it happen to go flat during a cold spell?
1054203,Woodsman,2019-12-28 02:33:00,1286,Yes I had this happen to me. It turned out to be a screw through the tread area of the tire. It depended on where the screw was when parked. If at the top of the tire it had no stress from where the tire flattens out at the bottom part of the tire. If on a more curved area of the tire like where the edge of the tire meets the road it would leak.
1054204,b_cdot,2019-12-28 03:01:00,270,"Just last week, it was after a couple days of very cold weather followed by mild weather"
1054205,b_cdot,2019-12-28 03:05:00,270,did a pretty thorough inspection and I've ruled out nail or screw
1054206,GBW,2019-12-28 03:14:00,8460,You need to see the whole tire (off the car with a good light) to ensure it's not a nail/screw.  Trust me they can be small and lost the head and it's just the pointy body now causing the issue.
1054208,bushart,2019-12-28 12:27:00,2628,This happened to me last year one of those black rims for your winter snow tires--- was only a couple years old it rusted in the  centre of the rim--just enough for a slow leak pretty sure they don't use the best steel on those good luck
1054211,Fisherman,2019-12-28 14:20:00,7201,"Ya, neighbour had 2 of his winter rims on his GM rust out from the inside out, complete junk."
1054216,Loonietoon,2019-12-28 15:58:00,1450,Go Back to where they were installed
1054223,Headhunter,2019-12-28 17:55:00,5703,"I'm guessing you have aluminum rims. As aluminum contracts due to cold, the rim seal gives way and you have a slow leak. It's the reason I keep a tire inflator in my vehicle all year round. There are solutions, but it requires that each tire and rim be removed, the rim set needs to be thoroughly cleaned, re-painted and re-installed. It aint cheap! HH"
1054227,misfish,2019-12-28 19:56:00,29133,Had 2 tires go low and the alarm went off. It was after a over night cold snap. Thought it was weird. Had them checked and blown to normal pressure. Been fine since.  Wierd.
1054228,GBW,2019-12-28 20:00:00,8460,"As Joe said, alloy shrinks in the cold.  Steel doesn't.  I ""assume"" snows are on a second set of steel wheels for most as to why my replies have been the way they are."
1054229,misfish,2019-12-28 20:11:00,29133,Rims are steel. Original since 2014 new. Been holding the right pressure since.
1054259,Old Man,2019-12-29 20:27:00,822,"One wheel on my 2005 Silverado does this every winter. It is common problem with aluminum rims, especially as they age. As soon as the weather gets cold, the bead seal leaks. I can go all summer with no problem, in cold weather, it starts to leak. The colder the faster it goes down. I have to top it up regularly through out the winter."
1054262,misfish,2019-12-29 20:47:00,29133,"Oh and here I sit and type, I had low pressure again. LOL Topped up and fine. I think it,s the bead on these 10 ply . New tires coming soon, as these have run their course."
1054263,ketchenany,2019-12-29 21:16:00,3229,You can save on tire wear by not going to the river every  spare hour!
1054677,b_cdot,2020-01-08 03:03:00,270,Follow up- Had to refill with air last week. The leak was around the valve stem. The valve stem was replaced at no cost.
1054679,GBW,2020-01-08 04:28:00,8460,Glad you found it and it wasn't costly 
1054680,b_cdot,2020-01-08 05:03:00,270,And the winner is...... GBW. Thank you all for playing lol!!
