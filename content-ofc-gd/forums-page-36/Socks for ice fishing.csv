1054276,DanD,2019-12-30 15:14:00,2223,That's what I have been doing the last few years; but two sizes larger. One pair of regular (thin summer) sock and then a pair of heavy wool socks. Not so thick of sock combination that my foot is still loose; lots of wiggle room. Since I've been doing that; no more cold feet. Dan.
1054287,Headhunter,2019-12-30 17:30:00,5703,"Stay away from anything made of cotton, in the cold, cotton kills! Any nylon dress sock will whisk moisture away from the foot. A good wool sock on top and you should be good to go assuming you follow the advice above and remove the insole each night. Any boot rated for -100C is a definite asset. See the Baffin lineup. HH"
1054455,Sinker,2020-01-02 18:26:00,8692,"1 pair of merino wool socks in my baffin titans and I've never had cold feet.  Always, warm, toasty and dry.  2 pairs, and my feet are cold. You need some room for air in your boots. Too tight, your feet will get cold.  Do yourself a favour and get some baffin titans while your shopping for merino wool socks. S."
1054492,SirCranksalot,2020-01-03 03:16:00,3291,Get Titans and don't worry about socks!! 
1054497,AKRISONER,2020-01-03 04:16:00,5558,Eigers are even warmer for people like me that always have cold feet!
1054498,GBW,2020-01-03 06:25:00,8460,"So, huzzsaba what did you do or are you doing?  LoL"
1054505,Lape0019,2020-01-03 14:37:00,647,"Friend recently bought Baffin boots and they will definitely keep you warm. I do not ice fish but my wife just bought me a pair of $100 heated socks and they work well for skiing. She bought them off amazon and so far, I have been impressed. The cheaper ones seem to not last long (like, they only heat up once or twice before dying) and these are thick enough as is. There are more expensive options but so far, I do have not found a reason to go with them."
1054511,Sinker,2020-01-03 18:54:00,8692,"Yes, but twice the money, and the same liners. Are they really waterproof??  They dont look like they will stay waterproof forever, like rubbber does."
1054146,huzzsaba,2019-12-26 23:35:00,884,"What do you guys recommend for socks that will keep feet warm for a day of ice fishing? I have tried 2-3 pairs of socks along with my good quality columbia boots, but feet are still cold. Any advice would be appreciated."
1054147,misfish,2019-12-26 23:40:00,29133," Flip hut and a buddy heater. It,s what works for me. LOL I would of said Red Head socks, but their new line is crap.  I stood in 6"" of river water yesterday with my new NATS. Never felt the cold at all . This from a guy that gets cold feet easy.."
1054153,GBW,2019-12-27 00:25:00,8460,"I am a fan of ""Polar Paws Heat"" socks.  Work great in my Baffin's or any other boot for that matter.  Soft too.  Just find any brand really at the CTC chain of stores that have ""heat"" in the socks type and you should be good.  PS, a layer between your boots and the ice really helps keep your feet that much warmer even if it's $1-store foam pads."
1054155,chris.brock,2019-12-27 00:27:00,4053,"I'm not sure what model you have Huzz, but I'm wondering if the boots might be the issue more than the socks?"
1054156,misfish,2019-12-27 00:28:00,29133,Yup. I just bought a new foam mat there this week.
1054158,huzzsaba,2019-12-27 01:09:00,884,Going to keep the  foam pads next time. Thanks
1054160,huzzsaba,2019-12-27 01:14:00,884,"Chris, not sure of model but they do have some heat retain technology or so they claim. Will try some better socks and see if that helps."
1054161,huzzsaba,2019-12-27 01:15:00,884,Thanks for the advice!
1054166,smitty55,2019-12-27 01:27:00,928,"The best socks you can get are Alpaca wool but they sure are pricey. I've always been somewhat susceptible to cold feet but what I do now is add a good thermal insole and put a foot warmer pack between two pairs of socks, but make sure to put it on top of the foot not the bottom where they get compressed and get no air so they don't stay hot.  Cheers"
1054171,GBW,2019-12-27 01:52:00,8460,These type of 'pads' is what I mean if you were wondering.  https://www.google.com/search?q=kids+foam+pad+floor&rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA857CA857&oq=kids+foam+pad+floor&aqs=chrome..69i57.11399j0j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
1054173,Woodsman,2019-12-27 02:18:00,1286,"By ""2-3 pairs of socks"" I hope you don't mean at the same time Too many socks can displace the air layer which insulates your feet."
1054175,irishfield,2019-12-27 03:50:00,26272,Make sure you're pulling the liners out of your boots to dry each night. And especially the pad below the liner that absorbs all your sweat through the day.
1054176,16 Footer,2019-12-27 10:19:00,191,My Canadian made Sorrels  with good quality wool socks keep my feet warm. Drying the boot liners and socks each night is very important.
1054177,mitch seguin,2019-12-27 11:53:00,98,Dahlgren socks are a mix of merino and alpaca.  They are a recommended sock for folks who have 'cold feet' issues resulting from blood circulation issues.    I wear a poly liner and Dahlgren socks and stay warm considerably longer than the previous tries of finding a solution.
1054181,sauce,2019-12-27 14:26:00,219,"Find some thick sicks. Boots one size larger than ""proper"" fit. Layers of socks will most likely restrict circulation. The $50 kamik insulated rubber boots and socks with  ""thermal"" or ""heat hold"" in the name are what I wear. Like others mention - dry the liners after use. Also, don't let your feet get sweaty on your drive to the lake. Running shoes in the car. Damp feet in rubber boots will stay damp and therefore cold all day."
1054183,NAW,2019-12-27 15:06:00,4022,"I have been using a 2 sock system that was bought for me a few years ago as a Christmas gift.  Cant remember the name brands.  But the pack comes with a base layer sock that wicks the moisture away.  Then a thick wool outside layer.    So you are wearing 2 pairs of socks, but they work together like one to keep you warm and dry. They work amazing. "
1054187,Fisherman,2019-12-27 16:39:00,7201,"After trying different methods and socks,  I keep coming back to this product, just toe warmers on the milder days, full length ones for brass monkey days.  https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/grabber-foot-warmer-insole-0750117p.html"
1054215,16 Footer,2019-12-28 14:44:00,191,Anybody have tried or experience with electric socks that are sold through Amazon?
1054220,misfish,2019-12-28 16:39:00,29133,"Cabelas had the toe warmers on for .97 cents. I bought the last 5 packs. The full size foot ones are $3.98 a pack of 2.  I have read so many reviews on different types of these. Have yet to see 1 ,that was a solid 5 star report through out the ratings. Lots of garbage out there."
1054221,Fisherman,2019-12-28 17:29:00,7201,"No personal experience with the electric socks,  but like you said, hit and mostly miss and a crazy price."
1054222,Fisherman,2019-12-28 17:29:00,7201,"That's one of my regular Xmas gifts, good for another year."
1054240,AKRISONER,2019-12-29 13:09:00,5558,I second the comment about the boots. I wore sorrels with double socks and wool and everything and my feet always ended up getting cold by the end of the day. I switched to some Baffin Eiger boots which are rated as some of the warmest boots on the market and sure enough my feet aren’t cold anymore. And my feet are almost always cold even when inside!
1054252,gordy28,2019-12-29 17:37:00,638,I am a big fan of Merino Wool socks - ideally in heavy weight.  Best pair I have are Cabelas brand but I dont think they carry the heavy weight anymore. 
1054268,DRIFTER_016,2019-12-29 23:30:00,10439,I wear a thin polypropylene liner sock with merino wool over sock. For boots I have US military boots. Feet are never cold even @ -40
1054274,NAW,2019-12-30 14:11:00,4022,That's the ticket right there...
