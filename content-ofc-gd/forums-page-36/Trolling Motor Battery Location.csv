1054570,bigcreekdad,2020-01-05 13:55:00,546,"My Alumacraft Magnum 165 Tiller is 20 years old. My two trolling motor batteries sit in a compartment in the middle of the hull up front, I've had no ride issues at all, and, honestly, don't know where I would even fit them in the back. I would agree with the poster who said that the manufacturers of good boats such as Alumacraft, Lund, and Crestliner likely put serious thought into all this."
1054573,Chris J,2020-01-05 17:15:00,44,Yup.
1054578,Old Man,2020-01-05 18:17:00,822,My 2007 Fishhawk had the trolling motor battery in the front centre compartment near the bow. Came from the factory that way. HadÂ that boat for 12 seasons with no issue. 
1054585,porkpie,2020-01-05 20:57:00,2521,Iâ€™d absolutely use those openings. Â Itâ€™s basically unused space and in a location that likely wonâ€™t unbalance you boat much. Â Iâ€™d just stuff the batteries under there in the spring without doing any wiring and take it for a good rip. Â If it seems ok wire away.
1054591,DRIFTER_016,2020-01-05 22:52:00,10439,I'd put them on the left side to help balance the weight of the driver when running/trolling solo. If you put them on the same side the boat will list badly with only one person on board.
1054592,porkpie,2020-01-05 23:06:00,2521,Most equally balancedÂ boats develop a slight list to one side when the operator isÂ solo.
1054599,jjcanoe,2020-01-06 03:50:00,744,"Anything else you store down there will end up soaked if it rains or you take a good splash over the side while running down the lake, definitely don't put your charger down there if you don't want to constantly be replacing it. Batteries on the other hand aren't affected by mould or mildew or generally damp conditions that will be found in the lowest point of your boat. Like I said in my earlier post, there's a reason why manufacturers put the batteries there."
1054600,jjcanoe,2020-01-06 03:56:00,744,True if it's a tinyÂ boat.Â  A larger boat is pretty much unaffected unless the solo driver weighs 400+ lbs. What happens when you bring a buddy out fishing? Move the batteries around some more?
1054615,DRIFTER_016,2020-01-06 16:40:00,10439,My problem is my doggo likes to chill under the console. He adds another 65#'s the to drivers side. I put my tackle bag on the other side to balance out the mutt. If the OP were to put the 120#+ of batteries on the console side it would list badly. It would not be as bad if it were on the other side even with a passenger. Alternatively the batteries could be split between the two locations.  
1054631,Musky Plug,2020-01-06 23:52:00,398,There is an actual compartment with a lidÂ between those spaces that I intended to put the charger in.  If it does I can just throw my tackle bag there to balance out the weight.
1054453,Musky Plug,2020-01-02 18:05:00,398,"Hey Guys, Hope everyone had a fun and safe holidays. As I posted in another thread I started,Â I recently purchased at new boat. 1650 crestliner fishhawk.Â I'm looking for advise on the best place to put the trolling motor batteries. I have a 24v terrova and the current system is only a 12v power drive . The battery is in the small compartment closest to the front of the boat, but 2 batteries and a charger won't fit there. There is a bigger compartment behind that would fit everything but I'm worried it might weigh the bow down to much. In the main area of the boat there are to areas that are open for the passenger and drivers feet and there's a small compartment in the centre. Should I put the batteries in the foot space and the charger in the middle compartment or everything the big compartment near the bow? I put a link to pics of the same boat so every one can get a better idea.Â Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.  http://www.iowafallsmarine.com/2005FishHawk.html"
1054459,David Chong,2020-01-02 20:04:00,836,"Having owned about 12 different boats over the years, in my opinion, keeping the the trolling motorÂ batteries as close to the back of the boat the better! This allows for the best performance for the boat!"
1054461,Fisherman,2020-01-02 20:32:00,7201,"What David said,Â  bow slam in rough water isn't good for batteries either."
1054463,OhioFisherman,2020-01-02 21:10:00,6623,"I am not positive but I think Lew had the same boat, not sure what he had for a electric bow trolling motor. Like others mentioned as far back as you can."
1054465,DRIFTER_016,2020-01-02 21:57:00,10439,"That didn't work in my case. The batteries and charger were fine in the back until I swapped out the 2 stroke for a heavier 4 stroke. I had to move the TM batteries to the front livewell to get the boat to balance right. Before I moved them a wall of water would come over the transom when coming off step due to it sitting too low in the back with the extra weight of the new 4 stroke engine. Before I move the 2 TM batteries forward the transom was 3-4"" lower in the water than it is now. "
1054467,grimsbylander,2020-01-02 23:11:00,3016,"Depends on the boats construction. If glass, go to the back for sure. Aluminum boats are too light in the bow in many cases so adding 75 lbs to the back doesnâ€™t work. Personally, Iâ€™d try to move gas up front before batteries."
1054469,Pigeontroller,2020-01-02 23:51:00,2793,"I agree with above about rear placement if possible. That said, I have a 1650 Lund Sendero. 3 hatches up front, the forward one only allowed for a single battery. When I made the switch to a 24v Terrova I put both batteries in the middle of the larger comparment, unfortunately they are right under the pedestal and not easily reached. I have a 90hp 4 stroke and don't feel performance is greatly effected...Though I've never had them in the rear...Cause there's no rear compartment!"
1054471,wkrp,2020-01-02 23:59:00,656,Get some sandbags and move them around to find the best location for yourÂ Â batteries.Of course you will have to wait till spring
1054472,misfish,2020-01-03 00:05:00,29133,Kemp bay is wide open. Get it done now and save time. ðŸ¤£
1054482,Fisherman,2020-01-03 01:14:00,7201,Probably open until mid next week.
1054489,Musky Plug,2020-01-03 03:01:00,398," I also read about this however, underneath the rear bench is the gas tank which is 68L. It is not located in the floor of the boat, as in some other brands. Would that be too much weight with what would be threeÂ batteries ( 2 trolling motor and 1 crank) and the charger weighing the back of the boat down?"
1054490,Musky Plug,2020-01-03 03:02:00,398,Never end thought of this. Good idea.
1054491,Pigeontroller,2020-01-03 03:07:00,2793,"My Lund has the same set up, 68 L tank in the rear bench. I was thinking i wouldn't want more weight back there when fishing...with the 90 4 stroke weighing close to 400 lbs. If there's two adult males back there...."
1054493,Musky Plug,2020-01-03 03:23:00,398,"Yes, this is the same scenario I'm in. Im concerned that the wight of the batteries toÂ the front, which would be in front of the live well,Â as well as the weight of the live well with water and fish may weigh the bow down to much.Â That's why I was thinking the foot area underneath the casting deck for the driver and passenger? Which would be behind live well more to the middle of the boat."
1054495,Pigeontroller,2020-01-03 03:35:00,2793,Seems like a good location. Wouldn't want them there on my boat because id be looking at them....
1054499,Garnet,2020-01-03 10:37:00,2056,"Have you run this boat with current setup. Did it feel front end light. Think I would temporary install battery's maybe just on floor near the permanent location just to getÂ  idea. Another thing get some of those mid western walleye sites. Michigan , Wisconsin. "
1054508,DRIFTER_016,2020-01-03 17:05:00,10439,Here's some images of a boat like mine. It shows where the factory placement of the batteries is.   And this image shows where I moved my TM batts to and the location of the fuel tank.  I have the back batt compartment plumbed for an auxiliary fuel tank now that gets used on long distance trips to the East Arm of Great Slave Lake. The factory tank is 18 gallons and runs sid to side and the aux tank adds another 12 gallons. I can switch between the two with a valve at the back of the boat. I still have the rear livewell to use if needed.
1054510,boombap,2020-01-03 18:22:00,310,"Have my 2 group 31's front and center on a 16.5"" aluminum deep v.. works great."
1054513,wkrp,2020-01-03 19:48:00,656,"Every boat has its ownÂ  CÂ Â Â of G depending on engine weight, fuel tanks, weight distribution etc etc. It is important that you find this sweet spot for your boat for safety'Â s sake ,Â boat performance and your comfort. Take your time and experiment"
1054514,Musky Plug,2020-01-03 20:45:00,398,Not necessarily looking at them the casting deck extends a little to make a sort of compartment without a face and in between is a compartment with a lid. 
1054515,Musky Plug,2020-01-03 20:50:00,398,"No I haven't run it and yes thats what I think I might do either that or do the sandbag idea. I will have a look at those sites. Thanks.  Yes, I'm looking atÂ kind of a similar idea."
1054516,Musky Plug,2020-01-03 20:58:00,398,"Yes, that's what I'm worried about. I did this in my old tin boat and put everything up front and the bow sat Real low in the water. Had to move them to the almost the middle of the boat.  The engine is approx 330ish lbs if I remember correctly. Along with aÂ tank of gas, someone fishing, 3 batteries (1 crank) and a charger and whatever other things end up back there, I think might be a little to heavy for that boat?"
1054518,Sinker,2020-01-03 22:04:00,8692,I'd want to run the boat in a bunch of conditions before i did anything permanently. S.
1054525,Pigeontroller,2020-01-04 00:55:00,2793,I think you're over thinking it.
1054527,jjcanoe,2020-01-04 01:01:00,744,"I've got a Crestliner 1700 Vision, 2 batteries up front in the battery storage area dead center of the keel and the charger is under the console. That spot is designed for the batteries I wouldn't put them anywhere else. Move your charger, it needs air since it will get hot when doing it's job. Don't over think things! Too much weight at the back will affect your ride, I can get 45mph with my setup with a 115 4 stroke. Believe it or not, boat manufacturers put thought into this process and run plenty of tests for things just like this. (Weight distribution). It's not an 40 year old tin boat, it's a new boat, go with what your manufacturer recommends."
