Jan. 16, 2019 at 6:30 PM Please come on by if you are in the Durham or east end of the GTA. We'll be talking HT products, Slab Grabbers, Navionics, Garmin electronics, Daiwa gear, Freedom Tackle and so much more this evening. Along with tons of ice fishing info, there will be a bunch of door prizes, snacks & refreshments to make it even more tempting. Hopefully we have some safe ice by then! "
