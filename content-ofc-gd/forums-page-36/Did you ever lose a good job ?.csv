1053950,Rattletrap2,2019-12-21 14:16:00,1652,"Interesting topic Lew. I have only been laid off once in 1983 when I was an Apprentice and we were in a recession. The company was the worst I ever worked for and I never looked back! It was a blessing in disguise, but it sure brought on a lot of stress at the time. I had bought our first house two years earlier and I was making twice the hourly rate at the time of purchase before I decided to quit and become an Apprentice. We had our first baby that year too. A few years back, I was doing an event called ""Future Building"" in Bowmanville. This is where 6,000 to 7,000 Grade 6,7,8 kids come with their Teachers and Guidance Counsellors to see what the Building trades are all about. This couple comes walking through an I asked them if they were Guidance Counsellors or Teachers. The guy says neither, I am an out of work Auto Worker and looking for a new career! He had to be early to mid '50's and my heart broke for him. I mean it is not impossible to start an Apprenticeship at that age, but it ain't easy either. Let's face it. That is probably the toughest age to be looking for a career job. Too young to retire for many, but too old to really start over! Companies are not putting a lot of value on middle aged workers. They would rather get them young and cheap. When starting over, the years they put in do not add up to experience on the job. Maybe life experience and maturity, but no job experience when starting completely fresh."
1053955,AKRISONER,2019-12-21 15:22:00,5558,"Can’t say I agree about it being a crap shoot, My immediate family and myself have been burned by each of the domestic manufacturers now. My father was a ford man through and through until the 90’s when he gave up on them. He even gave them another chance and bought a escape for my mom and it’s been stupid as well. Countless recalls and stupid stuff breaking. my truck is a lemon...just straight up...I could make a list of all of the problems I’ve had and the truck has less than 100,000k on it. It’s a joke. my favourite part is that in the winter I have to drive with my windows open because my truck dumps exhaust into the cab. I took it in three times under warranty and it was never fixed. I literally have to turn my heat off at stop lights to avoid being choked out Ford and GM my interactions with their head offices through my work seems to hint at the problems and attitude being systemic in both of them. Go figure the attitude is shared by both companies. ive talked about it at length, from outboards, snowmobiles, quads and cars now, the Japanese manufactures just do the job right. My family isnt even loyal to one particular one! at this moment we have 4 outboards ones a Honda two are Yamahas and ones a suzuki! it can’t just be coincidence that between  4 outboards , two quads, and 4 different vehicles from Honda, Nissan and Mazda we’ve never had an unexpected problem or stupid annoyance with any of them...good riddance to GM. I’m sure their quality is bound to improve even more when they hire more cheap Mexican labour. im sorry to anyone that’s worked for them, they have done you dirty and it’s not surprising. i already know I’m bound to catch flack from the GM or Ford guys on the forum saying “I love my Chevy, dodge, ford, Mercury, BRP” etc etc you bet, like clockwork my rotax 600 blew up with 500km on it. Thank god it was under warranty. brother owned a Chevy cobalt, and a loose bolt went through a cylinder and ended up in his oil pan at 13,000km maybe it’s just bad luck...but It just can’t be coincidence anymore when 10 times in a row the domestics break, and then 10 times in a row the japanese have 0 problems. Fool me once shame on you fool me 10 times shame on me!"
1054004,DanD,2019-12-23 12:48:00,2223,"I've only worked for four different people. The first was on the families farm until I was 16. In 1976 my Dad arranged an interview for me, with two guys at a garage; who needed an apprentice mechanic. Stayed with them all through my apprenticeship and writing for my license. I new there wasn't enough room ($ wise) for three mechanics; so I left them on good terms. The next day I got a job at a small two bay garage; the owner was stuck; his last mechanic quit without notice. I'm pretty sure that was the only reason he gave me a chance. I was a snot nosed 20 year old, waving a mechanic's certificate. LOL I stayed with him for about 4 years. Until he came to me and said that by the end of the mouth, I'll have 2 choices to make. Look for a new job or buy him out; he was retiring. So I bought him out and have been ""self employed"" ever since. Why the quotations on self employed; I have approx 4 thousand people in my customer file. That's how many employers I actually have. I'll never will get rich at this; but I was able to help put both my kids through university. My daughter is a lawyer working here in town. My son is an automotive engineer working in Warren Michigan and in this thread, he works for the dark side; GM. LOL He's the release engineer for North American rear wheel drive vehicles; anything that deals with engine mounts, transmission and body. He puts his OK on these types of parts, before they go to the assembly plants. There's been so many times; that he has told me that GM could and has come up on the quality of their vehicles; but it is the bean counters that are in charge. Kind of like the patients running the asylum. Dan."

1054029,Old Ironmaker,2019-12-23 21:42:00,8243,"My 1st real job other than pumping gas and delivering prescriptions for the local drug store I got a weekend job in the steel plant as a highschool 16 years old as well as a labourer for another contractor in the plant. I worked more than a few 40 hour weekends after school. I started full time while in grade 13 and almost made it through the school year working full time on shifts as a receiving/shipping clerk at Stelco Hilton Works. I started full time for Stelco on Nov. 7 1973. We had 25 and out in the Ironmaking Division and at 45 years old/young I took my very early pension as a middle level manager for a number of reasons. I have never collected a single unemployment payment in my life. I have had to hand out pink slips to several hourly rated employees through the years. It was a tough thing to do but not as tough for the guys getting the layoff. Many were living pay to pay with good salaries so I worried they would have a tough go on E.I. Many did and many marriages failed under the stress. I was always told I was ""lucky"" to have a steady job. Luck had nothing to do with it. Going in for a night shift on a weekend or worse was a long weekend at 20 something years old when all the boys were going out to party for the weekend up north wasn't being lucky. I can't count how many stats including Christmas's and New Years  I had to go in for, year real lucky. I remembering having to get a shift change to stand up for my brother on his wedding day, real lucky. When I went on days I had to ask my wife what goes on Christmas and New Years Eve? That helped open my eyes and realized there was a big world outside the steel mills and more to life than putting in 60 hour weeks so I cashed out. I was lucky. The harder you work the luckier you get. Johnny D. Dan D. you should be very proud. You reputation is only as good as your last happy customer."

My BIL was a 35 year employee of GM in St. Kitts and has always refused to drive any GM product for the same reason, how poorly they treat their workers. They are a 100% Chrysler family. I never got why someone would not support the company that their livelihoods and their pensions and benefits are tied to. Their success is the employees and pensioners success, or failure. No one is too big to fail, of course except our Governments. We do all our service and auto repairs at a small shop in Caledonia. The bonus is they are right across the street from where my wife works. It's run by 2 young brothers and I have zero complaints. They know everyone of their customers by 1st name. It's Caledonia Tire on Argyle St. South, I highly recommend them to any of you that live close by. I can't say that about the GM dealer or the CTC in town."
1054117,Rob,2019-12-26 14:35:00,467,"I own an F-150 and I like the truck, but like with most others have had my fair share of recalls and stupid repairs that are for the most part ridiculously priced. I worked for Magna for 11 years as a toolmaker and then 5 years in process engineering before switching careers and now teaching high school shop. When at Magna, I was treated well considering it was a non unionized environment. With regards to quality in vehicles, I dealt with Ford, Honda, GM, and Chrysler. Honda's quality and the way they deal with quality issues was far more superior to the North American automaker's. The bottom big the barrel for me was Chrysler, you couldn't get me to buy anything they had to do with. I always thought they had great design to their products but the quality just isn't there. Within my family we have three Toyota Camrys and they have been great cars for us. Would I buy another F-150? Probably because I like the size and comfort, just hope to hell I don't end up with a lemon!  Rob C"
1053879,lew,2019-12-19 13:17:00,12766,"Been watching the sad news about GM closing down after a century and so many folks losing the jobs they'd held for years. They made good money for a long time but now I spose most of them have to start over somewhere else. Just wondering if any of you guys had good jobs you thought you'd have for a long time then had the rug pulled out from under you ? I did OK myself, after I finished school I went into the Navy for a few years then joined the Fire Dept. in Toronto and stayed there for 32 years. Both jobs were secure with no threat of lay-offs and I was able to retire at 53 years old. How about you guys, any sad stories like the folks at GM who thought they were set for life ?"

1053882,Big Cliff,2019-12-19 15:19:00,6899,"Ya, I've never been out of work really but after I retired I decided to go back to work because I wanted something to do. I started working for a small company that was struggling and created a new division for them which started to really take off. It was doing so well it got to the point that we needed more staff so, based on a friends recommendation I hired a young man, with a young family that needed an opportunity. Well, long story short; he was a very charismatic young man but he wasn't as advertised and wasn't doing a very good job. Then I caught him stealing from the company. It was right around Christmas so instead of firing him on the spot I allowed him to pay the money back and gave him another chance. I went away on holiday for three weeks, when I came back I found out he had convinced the owner of the company it was all just a big misunderstanding, I just had it in for him,  and that he could do the job I was doing for less money. The owner fell for it and I was out of a job. Within 6 months everything I had built was gone, the division was closed down and everyone lost out. The sad part is that there were no winners. I feel really badly for the GM workers and the people that work for all the supporting industries, the GM workers do have a lot of resources available to help them transition, sadly many of the people outside of GM that are affected don't have the same supports in place to help them. I recently heard that even a new hire at GM even in a basic position was costing the company something like $75.00/hour with wages, benefits, and pensions. If that is accurate I guess it just makes sense that the company had to make some changes to remain competitive. "

BUT...  The bank would not give me a mortgage being a contractor.  So I had to quit and get a full time job.  My intention was to return to teaching in a few years once my mortgage had settled out.  But while I was on a hiatus from teaching, the union went on strike and they changed around the entire part time teaching situation.  And now there is no way in hell I will be able to return to teaching because they are basing it all on seniority not, that I don't have."

Got on as an assistant strength and conditioning job at a pro hockey team (team name rhymes with Reafs) and had my own gym where I trained pro baseball, hockey and MMA athletes. Loved it more than anything. it was great but no long term stability really and the hours didn't work well with the new family I was starting.

At one time there was around 75 different union trucking companies of all sizes in the area here, a lot of things factored into the changes, but deregulation of the trucking industry was the biggest thing.

The city called and said I would have to do training and have to jump off of Cleveland's fire training tower into a net, like 90 feet below, I had to pass, there would have to be a real fire for me to even consider a jump like that!
