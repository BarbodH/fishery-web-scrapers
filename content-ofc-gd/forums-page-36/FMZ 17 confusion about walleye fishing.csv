1054474,Tjames09,2020-01-03 00:23:00,664,I’ve talked to quite a few people lately and they all believe walleye is open January 1st on Balsam lake. I’ve read the FMZ 17 and the wording is very confusing because it’s listed below Crowe Lakes exceptions. Here’s the wording:   
1054475,Terry,2020-01-03 00:47:00,14456,"Wow  I need to read again, seems open at first glance "
1054476,Fisherman,2020-01-03 00:49:00,7201,"Look to the left side of the page,  Jan 1 to Mar 1 and 2nd saturday May to Dec 31"
1054477,Fisherman,2020-01-03 00:51:00,7201,"Nothing confusing at all.   I think it's misleading where the first section under exemptions is for Salmonids (light blue), one part open all year, second part date exemptions.  Then it goes to Walleye Seasons for the 3 listed lakes.   Crowe Lake, then Balsam, then Mitchell Lake.  Can't figure out how Balsam landed between Crowe and Mitchell, normally follows alphabetically."
1054479,Terry,2020-01-03 01:05:00,14456,But it’s always been closed during winter.   	I read the ood list of changes for some 17 and the did have anything for balsam
1054481,Fisherman,2020-01-03 01:12:00,7201,"Ok, got it,  Balsam and Michell have different possession limit but Don't open until May.  Only gov't could make it difficult."
1054484,porkpie,2020-01-03 01:24:00,2521,Looks like zone wide seasons apply to balsam.  No winter open season dates.
1054486,GBW,2020-01-03 01:56:00,8460,Correct.  Hence the line between after Crow lake
1054500,Ronzo,2020-01-03 13:06:00,124,"Man, these people must be the same ones who read 2 lines of a 12 line work email and reply ""Yeah, got it"". Then you realize, when you see the work they did, that they only read the first two lines. I don't see anything that confusing if you read the regulations start to finish. ""Zone-wide seasons apply"" is pretty straightforward."
1054512,Sinker,2020-01-03 19:05:00,8692,"Its clear to me, but I've been reading the regs for 40 years. To the average joe who fishes once or twice a year its a gong show. I was looking up a lake in zone 15 over the holidays, and it took me an hour to check every thing, every exception, and then double check to make sure the lake was open. Its silly. They  need to arrange it by lake, and then list the exceptions for that specific body of water."
