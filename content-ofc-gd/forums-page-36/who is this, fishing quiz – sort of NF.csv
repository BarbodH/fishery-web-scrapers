1053965,lew,2019-12-21 21:35:00,12766,I'm thinking Tiny Bennett from the old Toronto Telegram maybe ?
1053967,ketchenany,2019-12-21 21:39:00,3229,I'm not that old Lew!
1053969,lew,2019-12-21 21:44:00,12766,I am LOL
1053977,Spiel,2019-12-22 14:01:00,9065,Me too. 
1053978,Spiel,2019-12-22 14:02:00,9065,"I think that is Powers. John or Gord, don't recall?"
1053982,OhioFisherman,2019-12-22 16:21:00,6623,""" used Anise oil on baits  "" Wow! Some of you guys are real geezers! LOL me too! I don't how much that helped, but it didn't seem to hurt, and it is still available. https://www.lurepartsonline.com/Scented-Worm-Oil"
1053983,pikeyminnow,2019-12-22 16:25:00,18,I’m thinking it looks like John Powers too. He used to be outdoors writer for the Toronto Star and I’m pretty sure he used to live in Beaverton.
1053986,ketchenany,2019-12-22 17:24:00,3229,"You are so correct, fished with hima couple of times "
1053989,misfish,2019-12-22 18:33:00,29133,"Way back when, I cut round roe bag size out of colored sponge , I dipped them in melted wax scented with anise, when I fished the whirlpool.   Worked great."
1053993,Beans,2019-12-22 20:34:00,3339,"After I have cooked my maise for carp fishing I always pour half a bottle of anise in it as it is cooling... Don't know the proof but there is nothing like a mad, drunk carp pulling your string...recipe by Photoz  !"
1053994,Fisherman,2019-12-22 21:02:00,7201,"Photoz, that's a name I haven't heard in a long time."
1053995,lew,2019-12-22 21:09:00,12766,He was one of the nicest guys on this board and it's always sad when we lose the good ones too soon.
1053996,Fisherman,2019-12-22 21:16:00,7201,"Long time ago used to fish with him in the Barrie marina, super nice guy and pretty mellow."
1054003,Garnet,2019-12-23 11:08:00,2056,I remember going into drug store  for oil of Anise. Long strait hair mid back about 20 not sure why I got strange look from pharmacist .
1054307,David Chong,2019-12-30 21:45:00,836,I had quite a few great conversations with John back in the day but never had the privilege of fishing with him. He was an awesome writer.
