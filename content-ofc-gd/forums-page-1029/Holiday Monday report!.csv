203635,Stoty,2008-05-20 12:39:00,2910,"My two buddies and I got out for some Pike/Walleye action near the Bay of Quinte yesterday, and the Pike co-operated, but the walleye and weather didnt! We were stuck fishing in one bay all morning because of the HIGH winds and 4 foot waves in the main lake!! It was insanely rough out there!  There were no monsters caught, but some decent fish.  My first Pike of the season..   My buddy Jay's first pike of the season..   A cool shot of Jay's Pike...   All in all, a good morning. Heck any morning spend fishing is a good morning!"
203641,Spiel,2008-05-20 12:45:00,9065,"....You persevered under adverse conditions and it payed off, good on you."
203644,muskymike,2008-05-20 12:48:00,772,"Nice Job Stoty, I wish I would have been able to get out this weekend."
203645,BillM,2008-05-20 12:48:00,17367,"Fish were tight lipped yesterday, water temp dropped 4 degree's from Saturday..   Had a follow from a big pike on the Severn River, but we couldn't rise her after that."
203648,Stoty,2008-05-20 12:51:00,2910,"Ya, the weather was nasty to say the least!  Weird though, because the fish we caught were super aggressive. They were chasing BIG crankbaits that were being reeled in FAST. The one I caught was on a followup. My buddy missed the fish on a spinnerbait, and I threw a jig/grub right behind it, and he slammed it.  Lots of OOS bass too, and some BIG ones. I lost a largemouth at the boat that must have been 5-6lbs, it was massive.  But for the conditions, the fish were abnormally aggressive, which I was surprised about."
203806,Rich,2008-05-20 18:00:00,3927,"Nice work! Good to see people getting out in all conditions. Too many of my buddies are ""fairweather fishermen"", lol, sucks to be them!"

203876,Reef Runner,2008-05-20 19:36:00,981,"Haven't had much time Stoty, just blew in from Punta Cana yesterday and I'm back at my desk playing catch up.  Thanks for the link...will watch with anticipation.  Too bad I can't help you guys out much until mid-June, LSAT studying that I've been slacking on.  I might get out for a weekend to raise some numbers.  on that note, I will make up my share once that damn test is over...so help me jebus."
