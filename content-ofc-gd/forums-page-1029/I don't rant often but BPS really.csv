203752,maybe,2008-05-20 15:48:00,307,"Since we were rained/blown off the lake, Jeff & I went wandering tackle shops on Sunday.  Was our first time stopping into Gagnon's, and I've gotta say...they've got an absolutely stunning variety of stuff.  I felt like I was let loose at Willy Wonka's.  The marked prices, however, were high.  $9 for a Rapala that's $8 at BPS, and $50 over MSRP on one Shimano rod (but BPS is $60 over for the same thing).  Pleasant surprise of the day:  JB's in Etobicoke had the same rod priced at MSRP...$50 less than the nearest competition.  Was starting to think I'd never see it."
203765,big guy,2008-05-20 16:32:00,414,"If you ask me, Bass Pro has really gone downhill over the last 2 years or so. Poor service, lack of stock are the main things to me.  On the flip side, Lebaron has way more stuff in than they use to have, they pretty well always have the shelves stocked and their prices on many items, especially graphs, are as low or lower. Case in point, picked myself up a Humminbird 717 on Saturday, $6 cheaper than BPS. They seem to be friendlier than they used to be as well, more willing to help if you need it."
203770,fishinggeek,2008-05-20 16:50:00,325,"  TL, thanks for the info.  I'll still pop in if I'm in the area, with my trusty LeBaron catalogue in hand, but it'll be a quick and cheap visit if I see high prices."
202723,Billy Bob,2008-05-16 21:46:00,5865,"I just had the complete opposite at the BPS store in Auburn, NY.  The manager at that store must have really done a good job screening applicants for salesmen. I have also experience VERY good service in the two Cabela's store I visited two years ago in MN and SD.  However, we have a Gander's Mountain store here that the service is the pits not to mention their HIGH prices there. I like to call it Expensive Mountain  Bottom line each store is a reflection of the store management."
202726,goteeboy,2008-05-16 22:03:00,175,"maybe the sales rep transferred from Lebaron. sounds like classic Lebaron service.  IMHO, generally speaking USA customer service is significantly better than Canada...BPS, department stores, Crappy service Tire (need I say more), etc.  Now Lowe's, I've only been there once but was very impressed w/ their customer service."
202755,Ron,2008-05-17 00:40:00,1683,"I was in at BPS a couple of weeks ago. I can't say enough about the great service I received. There is this guy by the name of Roger, you got questions, he's got answers! Anthony (I think that was his name), is an avid muskie angler. He and I had a great conversation, very knowledgeable. As for this Roger dude.....lets just say he looks pretty! ha ha ha  Nice chatting wit ya Roger. I hope that young lad did OK on those Crappie jigs I directed him to. His Dad was very interested as well, nice to be able to educate new and interested, willing to learn anglers of the future."
202770,bpsbassman,2008-05-17 01:24:00,941,"Yah, and you're a real looker too Ron!!!!   Hey, I learned a lot too Ron, but then again all the staff members are stupid One of the most rewarding things about the store is getting the young ones pumped up about fishing.  The guy you were talking to was Andrew and you're right very knowledable and friendly."
202788,mepps,2008-05-17 02:27:00,1301,"I get mixed ractions at BPS (and most places really) but then again I'm usualy dressed in a way that makes me look like I cant afford a proper shirt.  I find the reel guys at BPS are not very knowlegeable , I;ve only spoke with a few that were actualy helpful.  I walked in one day ready put dw $500 on a reel and walked out becuase they wouldnt acknowlege me - and when they finaly did, they told me that the reel I wanted didnt come in lefty.  I opened the Shimano book on the counter and pointed to the reel I wanted and read the text aloud stating that it was left handed and he simply said the dnt carry them.  Not an offer to order one for me or anything. He just walked away.  I'll ust wait for Roger next time!  I'll be at BPS in Atlanta Georgia tomorw, hopefulyl I can get some good servce, I want a new reel!"
202790,lazybum,2008-05-17 02:35:00,142,With all this talk about BPS I suddenly got that big urge to go for a visit this afternoon. And left $90.00 poorer. Service was good.
202955,brickNblock,2008-05-18 02:05:00,598," Actually..Gagnon's is one of the best priced places going. Dont get me wrong...I love my time at BPS and my old regular..'Tightlines' in Pickering but Gagnon's..... Jason..the young guy...he's the heir apparent and he'll deff. give you the deal of the day. Brian in electronics there really knows all the stuff and if you can find a better price anywhwre they will undercut it..by pennies..just the same..it'll cost less for your repeat bizz. That is what its all about tho.....repeat bizzzzz...for the small market or none BPS anyway. This year I put in my wish list to Gagnon's and they gave me a price that beat everyone elses.... You want to know why...because they know me...not personally but as a reg. customer and fisherman. They did their own research of the competition and gave me a block price on what I wanted far below the comp...(cuz they knew I would research it) Sometimes its far better to go to the small guy ....OFTEN. Gagnon's got just over $3500 in biz from me this year alone...prob saved me about $600  Another place I frequent often partly because of location...is Skevy's in Belleville....Why? The same reasons.... On any given day you can walk in there and see Keith, Gary ...Italo etc.. Again why?....because they have what it takes.....They know their stuff and will better then price match.....Again..its because you frequent their bizz. If its happening on the BoQ these foks know....and they have the fishermen in there every morning to prove it.  Good friend of mine off this board gave me a low down on some electronics from Radio World.... Not going to mention his name 'cept he dont smile in pics often... Gagnon's beat their price hands down...  I think you have to get out there and actually spend some time with certain bizz's ..and cha-ching. BPS IMHO has a great reel department...... Jackie..(2Jack2) was one of the best.....I believe he is now manager of that dept. Still, if he isnt there...service can be difficult and prices are as listed. I think you have to spend the time with the retailers....same as spending the time on here... its all for info on the sport we love."
202979,Rustic-Fisher,2008-05-18 03:17:00,826,"Actually most of the BPS staff in the fishing Dept also hold careers such as, Teachers, Police officers, Military, Firefighters and Business men. So your comment about dropping more money in the store than those two guys make in a year is irrational and down right rude BIG SHOOTER LOL!!!!!! Most the guys in that Dept work there for the love of the sport and enjoy talking to others about the sport.  RF"
203207,steverowbotham,2008-05-19 05:06:00,1800,"I work full time 5-2 at BPS, and I cant imagine a customer waiting 10 minutes for service.  Not on my shift at least, if someone is busy, they are usually right with you when they are done with the first guy.  Not to say it didnt happen, just that 10 minutes seems like a stretch.  We get so much new stock in, its hard for even the full timers to keep track of everything, and most of the reels dont come in a left hand retreive, so maybe the employee was confused.  Regardless, if you have a problem, talk to the manager."
203679,fishinggeek,2008-05-20 13:37:00,325, Thanks for the info!  I must've confused Gagnon's with another store.  I will be sure to stop in (with my trusty LeBaron catalogue in hand) next time I'm in the area.  Yes I too heard about how good the prices at Radio World can be.  I can't say enough how this board can be good for the price sensitive fishermen.
203709,ecmilley,2008-05-20 14:35:00,2163,"wellif you work there, then I'll make sure I go when your on shift. and it was 10 minutes according to my watch as well it was two people not one. in the end i do realize it's a big store and I never have a problem so long as I know what I am looking for. As for the left hand retrieve reels they are clearly marked at bps as to which ones are availabe in lhr I would expect some effort on the part of the staff to help me with my request."
202230,Rustic-Fisher,2008-05-15 17:11:00,826,"Yep, Ask for the MOD right away! This is one store that will go to great extents to ensure your expectations are exceeded ! Like Roger I also work part time at  BPS in fishing so if your in the shop say hey!!! "
202329,ecmilley,2008-05-15 20:29:00,2163,"Thanks guys, I really should have asked for the manager but seeing that i work customer service as well, and just finished my 11 hour day i was in no mood to play anymore games with the two people giving me a lackluster display of knowledge, seeing i wasn't able to get what I wanted that night I didn't see any point in pursuing the matter I'll just stop at gagnons on the way home tonight and check out what they have"
202345,fishinggeek,2008-05-15 20:54:00,325,"Isnt Gagnon's one of the most expensive stores though?  I've only been in there once or twice but I thought the prices were threw the roof.  BPS is good for one thing though, and that's the cure for cabin fever!  I rarely buy anything there, but it's good window shopping where you can physically examine the merchandise.  And watching the fish tank is pretty neat too.  And it's not hard to drag the mrs to the mall.  And when I find something I like, I just get it from a cheaper competitor like Le Barons, though I'll be sure to use allamericanoutdoors.com for the bigger ticket items.  That company sounds like a real deal, and I'm thankful they're supportive of OFC."
202347,misfish,2008-05-15 20:59:00,29133, I have the exact reel. It is a great price and I love it.
202438,danbouck,2008-05-16 00:39:00,4380, Well said!
202444,SlowPoke,2008-05-16 00:48:00,2984,"I have been to Bass Pro Vaughn a number of times and am always underwhelmed. When I did the Michigan tackle shop tour I almost left Bass Pro Auburn Hills off the list. I'm glad I didn't. Out of the seven or so shops I visited in Michigan, it was the best in terms of service and a close second in pricing to Sportsman's Warehouse. Retail/Customer Service is taken very seriously in the United States and it seems to lose something coming across the border re: Bass Pro, Wal*Mart, Home Depot etc."
202455,bpsbassman,2008-05-16 01:19:00,941,"Don't forget that BPS will price match.  No sense in running all over the country burning gas.   Sorry, I know I'm biased, but ask motv8tr or a few others about BPS' contribution to Fishing for Tyler and other events.  BPS puts significantly more back to the industry than any other store!  A lot of what they do goes under the radar, because in many cases they're not looking for the publicity out of it."
