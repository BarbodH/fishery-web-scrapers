203326,bucktail,2008-05-19 18:12:00,1857,Looking for some help on Lake of Bays lakers.  Going to the bosses cottage and would like to put him on some fish next weekend but I have never even seen the lake. Have the Navionics chip and I assume the Lakers will be in there usual mid May transitions spots = ALL OVER THE DAMN PLACE!  Can anyone help a brother out and throw him a few spots or patterns to look for.......all catch and release and tight lipped .   Thanks  Darren

When I was there last month we caught fish on a shoal over near Dorset, look for a small creek mouth and try around there.  I havn't really fished the lake much.  Try using the search feature, it might help more than I can."
