203268,Greencoachdog,2008-05-19 15:11:00,8163,Cheap advertising eh?
203271,ricoboxing,2008-05-19 15:36:00,398,"nope, free!!"
203272,sonny,2008-05-19 15:51:00,511,"Who better to learn from then someone who does it for a living,,,i welcome the tips from all the pro's on the board,,,Do you think you would try the set-up he recommends the next time you go out on your boat??  i know i'd be giving it a try! I'm sure there would be alot more tips from all the pro's if people didn't bash them for when they did,,,  just my opinion,,for i am just a fisherman always trying to learn!"
203273,Billy Bob,2008-05-19 15:56:00,5865,When do the BIG ones start biting
203277,Hellfish,2008-05-19 16:06:00,308,"GCD what the heck,u either need to go out fishing or just get over it. I know i dont post much but it is people like you bubba who give great sites like this the whole ""drama"" theme that nobody wants.Fishmaster is a hard working man who puts ppl all over ontario into fish im sure there are alot of people from OFC that he has helped a great deal he doesnt have a problem halping anyone out. Almost 600 posts of threads like this. What is the problem, look back last year you will see plenty of them as well. Fishmaster im sure cliffs board NRS would love the reports man keep em comming, either way your the man when it comes to the Salmonoids on Lake O thats for sure."
203281,kuhaman,2008-05-19 16:12:00,503,Can I promote my marine electronics business here? LOL
203297,Greencoachdog,2008-05-19 16:50:00,8163,  You say the sweetest things Hellfish!!!
203300,HTHM,2008-05-19 16:54:00,4082,"Yep, there is a section in the classifieds devoted to just that."
203322,Billy Bob,2008-05-19 17:55:00,5865,I think what GCD is trying to say is that if this is allowed and gets out of hand it could be detrimental to the site. It all depends if the poster is a regular poster here or if he just drops in to benefit himself. I don't think jumping on GCD was necessary or accomplished anything. But hey I'm just Yankee visitor here that really enjoy this site as it is. Good people and LOTS of good helpful info  Bob
203323,bucktail,2008-05-19 18:09:00,1857,That first laker is a real beauty!
203324,silveradosheriff,2008-05-19 18:10:00,1025,Great report....here is the link to the SM Derby.  http://www.salmonmastersderby.com/Leader_Board/advanced.php
203335,POLLIWOGG,2008-05-19 18:39:00,835,If your going to fish salmon you want all the help you can get from the guys that are out there every day.  Can I promote my marine electronics business here? LOL  Hey I got an old marineteck maxim that DOA .........
203375,Photoz,2008-05-19 20:17:00,792,"Yeah h h h h  h . . . . .    you let him advertise for free, next thing ya know somebody will be tryin' ta flog a new bait for free (under the pretence of givin' it away to a few lucky receipients) . . . .     then a new kinda fishfinder . . . . .     there'll be no end to freebies. . . .    gotta nip 'er inna bud eh? (Nice fish BTW!!)"
203380,fishindevil,2008-05-19 20:24:00,6254,"Awesome salmon fishing on lake o bud !!!!!.  ..grerat looking fish & happy customers too,keep up the great work!!!!! hope to see you on the water   cheers"
203402,Canuck2fan,2008-05-19 21:35:00,1444,Thanks for letting me know about the chance to win 500 bucks for the biggest fish of the day. Which is what the post was about. Adding some fish porn just made it better!!!!
203406,Clampet,2008-05-19 21:52:00,1947,"Some posters promote their business by incorporating the ad in their signatures. D****e did that fer his employer, who refused to pay any advertising fees, who in turn, rewarded him by terminating him."
203411,JohnF,2008-05-19 22:11:00,3494," Isn't this really just drawing the line between blatant self-promotion and fishing fun? Sometimes the two get crossed up and frankly, I'd rather run the risk of being exposed to a little promo for some member with a business interest than missing a chance to get at some real fish porn. And who knows, I may be in the market for a paid seeing eye dog to get me onto some real fish in an unfamilair environment, or a connection at a gear retailer. and who better than a contributor to our group?  If I find anyone's posts offensively commercial and self-serving, I'll just ignore 'em, and mebbe even manage to get in a little adverse publicity for them later on. It's no big deal. If they're too blatant they'll hear about it. Hopefully the mods will see fit to just eliminate 'em. But members, I'm okay with them mentioning their businesses. After all, aren't we all just looking for more fun out of this? Fun can easily be a trip to Bass Pro or a jaunt out on the rivers or lakes with a pro guide, right?  If it's too blatant we'll all gripe, and the message will get out - don't abuse the privilege here.  Respectfully JF"
203430,Squid,2008-05-19 23:03:00,1656,"  board rules John.  ""Spam will get you banned faster than anything else. Spam is any unsolicited business ad or offer. If someone happens to ask about a product or service you may offer, then you are of course free to mention it. If you come in here and spam, you will be given a pretty rude welcome by the population and it will only hurt your business! We have very reasonable ad rates and can set you up very quickly.Contact TJQ for ad rates.""  There have been 570+ hits of this post. I applaud Steve for posting his business on here and showing us some pictures to entice us even further. Richard Collins, An awesome muskie guide on the Ottawa, was banned for less than this. Maybe Steve owns part of the OFC which in turn allows him to get away with this stuff. Glen, you are right on the ball man. This post would have lasted 5 mins on this board 5 yrs ago."
203434,mikeh,2008-05-19 23:18:00,824,"When I saw this post the one thing that stuck in my mind was that there is a new derby on Lake Ontario with a chance to win $$$$$ , plus some pretty nice size fish with some details. thanks for posting."
203436,silveradosheriff,2008-05-19 23:28:00,1025,"Steve provided some good information on what has been producing, showed some kewl pics of his customers and let people know about the derby. Give the guy a break....."
203437,Bernie,2008-05-19 23:29:00,3190,So I could do it like this.  Hey guys I just went fishing in my brand new 2008 Brand X  boat that I just bought at -------- -------  for $--------. Heres a Pic at the showroom. I towed it with my pickup that I just had repaired at ------- -----  .  Hmmmm? Sorry but it isn't fair to all.
203441,silveradosheriff,2008-05-19 23:35:00,1025,Congrats on the new ride!
203444,Jen,2008-05-19 23:39:00,833,"We all fish because we love those moments, where line is peeling out, you have no idea what you will bring into the boat and your mind is reeling just as quickly.  These are the moments where we are not thinking about anything but what we love to do, our minds clear and adeneline pumps through our vains... THAT IS FISHING.  Some of us have the great opportunity to do this thing called fishing as a job... It is ""work"" !  Getting up everyday just as the moon starts to drop from the sky, days can be very long but they preserver.  Through no fish days, the price of gas, clients moods, they get out there to catch fish.  Many donate their time and money to our fisheries, belong to clubs to promote wildlife awareness, speak at meetings to educate fellow anglers, as well as donate their time and product for the good of others. This may be a dream job however it is still a job and very hard to post your stories without that being evident.  If none of the men or women that ""work"" for a living catching fish posted on sites us HOBBY fisherpeople wouldn't know as much as we do... Utilize the information!  The more we bash them, belittle them or pick apart their posts the less will be posted.  I can say I would miss out on enjoying not only some beautiful pictures but knowledge that I gather by reading all they share about their days on the water.  What ever happened to the day when you could come online to share your experiences with pride ?  This is about fishing... the reason that we are all here."
203454,TJQ,2008-05-19 23:50:00,7806,"Sometimes its a hard call...  fishmasters has posted some great stuff, and i look forward to more posts in the future.  Its been a long weekend and mods have been in and out.     I think the point has been made, but ill lock this rather than deleting it.  Thanks for listening....  Back from the bush... cold wet and miserable...  TJ"
