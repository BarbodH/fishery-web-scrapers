Quite often it will be the biggest speciman the angler ever encounters..be it a trophy Muskie or Bass.  The fact is..the fish should be released in the water, quickly & un-harmed ..not mugged for photos. It's about RESPECT for the creature & the resources.  Ethics/morals are slowly learned as a sportsman/woman matures & learns all about nature & her ways. Be safe & smart out there & catch a lunker this year..in season."
203692,Stoty,2008-05-20 14:10:00,2910,"Oh geesh, here we go.  As long as the fish is released in a timely manner, I dont see harm in taking a picture."
203694,danbo,2008-05-20 14:13:00,2646,"It's actually the Law, Grasshopper. Read the Regs. Why do you always pick fights with me?  How many Bass will get ripped off their nests this year? Ever wonder why the fishing aint what it used to be? How many monster Musky are found ""belly-up"" in the pre-season?  Dang!!"

203698,TJQ,2008-05-20 14:18:00,7806," That is correct Lew... we have had this discussiuon time and time again, and it always winds up with name calling... im locking this down, there is no reason to revisit this again and again."
