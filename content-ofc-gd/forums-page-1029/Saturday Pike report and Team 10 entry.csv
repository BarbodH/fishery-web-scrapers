203075,bucktail,2008-05-18 19:53:00,1857,"Braved the HORRIBLE weather on saturday and headed out to my favorite pike lake looking to get team ten in the books for thhe year.  Isolated showers turned out to be a POURING 5 hour rain.  Launched at 9 and me and Vothsky headed out to start my milk run of pike spots.  Second cast in Chris gets a 4 pound pike and the day is off.  We hit alot of different spots, water was very cold ranging from 46 to 50 degrees. No major fish in the main spawning areas in the morning, at leastthe were not active.  Moved off the spawning areas and fished some rocky shorelines connected to them and started picking up pike but nothing better then 6 pounds.  As the cold front started to pass the fish got really active with about 10 in 10 minutes but still no large fish.  decided to head about 5 Miles up the lake to a spot I had seen on a map that should be good. As we got there we saw a boat and 2 guys with fishing rods leaving.... damn , used water!!!!  Decided to go in anyway and the the first cast into 16 inches of water by a fallen log I pull out this 37 incher!!   That's better!  Sorry for the blurry image, camera was still soaked from the crap weather.    Next cast....... a 38 inch fish!   Fight him and stop lauging....almost exhausted now.  retie, check my husky jerk and proceed up the shoreling towards another fallen log.  Throw right tight in beside the log and bam another good fish, Chris asks me how big? I say not sure but big!, the water was very tanic.  Finally I see a big tail as she powers toward the log! I am hauling back with my 30lb Fireline Chrystal and stop her just inches shy. Spend the next 2-3 minutes really fighting this fish delicatley as the bay is full of sunken timber.  Finally Chris does the perfect scoop and 42 inches of thick heavy northern hit the floor.  Grab my OFC sign for the tourney and with 2 quick pictures she is pack in the water and full of spunk.     Ended the day with 30 pike, only the 3 were big and maybe 10 OOS bass.  Great day except for Chris not getting a big one and of course the weather. He still needs to pay his dues on the pike anyway.  Doing it all again on Thursday!"

203530,bucktail,2008-05-20 01:58:00,1857,"Thanks guys and girls! Going back on Thursday and looking for the elusive 50 incher. I really like monster pike, there so confined to certain times and places I think they are alot harder to get then big muskies....well at least south of the 50th. Monster browns are my other passion even tho it doesnt work out as well for them."
