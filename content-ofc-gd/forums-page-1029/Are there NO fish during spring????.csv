203611,YUMMYAPPLE,2008-05-20 11:58:00,9,"I went fishing at bayfront park in hamilton and i couldnt see a single fish in the water near shore.  NOT EVEN A ROUND GOBY!  needless to say, i didnt catch nothing either.   I always hear that you guys say that spring is a great time for shore fishing. What am I doing wrong?  When do the fish come out?"
203624,Clampet,2008-05-20 12:14:00,1947,"It is too cold right now.  We are experiencing a late Spring start. Maybe in 2 weeks, depending of course, on how quickly the sun comes out, you will be able to catch some fish.  Right now, they are in deeper water, where it is warmer."
203625,YUMMYAPPLE,2008-05-20 12:16:00,9, Oh I see.  Thank you

As I recall the perch run petered out in May, and I shore fished at Waterford for Crappie and Pike, and waded at Caladonia for Steelhead (Lake Erie Rainbow Trout) and Walleye in May. Garry2R's"

203786,CLofchik,2008-05-20 17:23:00,854,"There's plenty of fish down there, been out about half dozen times in the last two weeks and always catch SOMETHING. I like to cover water down there, 3-4 casts then move to the next spot down.  Some days I catch all my fish in Macassa Bay, others by Leander.  I cover the boat launch to the rowing club in about 2-3 hours, have caught pike (nothing over 30"" darnit, I lost my big one on Friday, whaaaaa!) lots & lots of drum over 10lbs, and a few oos bass.  Usually catch 3-4 fish in an evening.  Cordell Redfin & X-Rap have caught all my fish, nothing on spoons or spinnerbaits.  But I've seen some nice carp cruising around lately (20lb+), might give those a shot soon."
