You actually go downstairs to a classroom and watch the diver describe the fish as he is feeding them.  Usually have a conservation officer there too with a few snakes and other wildlife.  Very cool."
203673,mikeh,2008-05-20 13:25:00,824,"bpsbassman...the link was kids who videotaped two of there friends who jumped in a fishtank in one of the stores in the states , the video was put on youtube.  I read that there was enough evidence on the tape to identify them and charge them."
203681,bpsbassman,2008-05-20 13:41:00,941,I'll have to check it when I get home. What kind of lure did they use to get them out??
203686,Stoty,2008-05-20 13:53:00,2910,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA Oh man, that is the funniest thing I have seen in a while!!!  :lol:"
203696,Baptiste,2008-05-20 14:16:00,37,"Maybe I'm just getting old but I don't find that funny. Totally Disrespectful. I'm sure they have video of them spray painting graf on buildings too. I don't think a kid who goes fishing would do that, so why were they in BPS. F*cktards. Just my two cents."
203714,Zubris21,2008-05-20 14:41:00,563,I also don't find this very funny..  I hope those kids get a good punishment rather than just a slap on the wrist.
203777,jdmls,2008-05-20 17:04:00,575,BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH YOU GOTTA HAVE BALLS
203796,Pachone,2008-05-20 17:47:00,276,Funny cuz its ballzy
203797,Rich,2008-05-20 17:48:00,3927,"lol, sad thing is they probably planned that for weeks in advance. If only they'd put that much effort into a fishing trip."
203818,Stoty,2008-05-20 18:28:00,2910,"hahahah, I know eh   I wonder if they got charged for Stupidity?!?!?"
203897,tibbs,2008-05-20 20:07:00,650,"Ya, i don't find that funny even though i'm a kid.  It was pretty pointless too since they stayed in the water for 2 seconds and ran away like cowards."
203922,steverowbotham,2008-05-20 20:25:00,1800," Well seeing as they would have been charged.... running away was probably a good idea. Pretty funny if you ask me, although they do deserve a fine"
203937,misfish,2008-05-20 20:51:00,29133,"Hey Terry,what ya doin this saturday????????????????????????? Part of me found it funny, but the other side, found it  stupid and disrespectful. Guess Im getting old too.LOL"
203939,Zubris21,2008-05-20 20:58:00,563,"Just watched it again... I still think it's stupid and disrespectful, but it is pretty funny when the second guy yells ""cannon ball"" before jumping in."
