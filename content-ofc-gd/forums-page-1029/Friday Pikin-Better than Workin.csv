202778,joonmoon,2008-05-17 01:56:00,528,"My wife and I hit the pond again for our second Pikin this week. I landed 13 Pike from the squirt to 26"" and she 7 Pike with the biggun of the day just shy of 30"".   In no time we figured out a decent pattern and spent the late morning gettin slimed. Lots of fun today and plenty of hungry fish.   Met up with my Bro in his yak and shared the secret of the day puttin him onto some decent toothies as well. We left the water @ 1:30 pm so not sure how his final numbers made out but he was well on his way to double digits as well, I'm sure he'll pipe in here with results.    Gotta luv the Bluefox.  Once we got home we noticed the bumper on the van was squeakin as we drove upon further investigation... the frame has rusted out and the hitch bar and the bumper is pulling away from the frame when we haul the trailer....so now its time to get a new tow vehicle or the ""Augustawind"" will be parked, and we just can't have that now can we...lol."

202906,jediangler,2008-05-17 19:33:00,1923,"Great day on the water with you two. I fished until 2pm and ended up with 12 pike. After you left I tried the blue fox #4 in firetiger and that got me another 5 fish. My biggest was only 24"" but if you hold them close enough to the camera they look bigger    You are lucky that your tow hitch didn't come off while driving home on the 401 or this might have been the last photo of the ""Cooler w/seats"".    I'm still working on the video I took of you, it'll be done soon, I hope."
202918,007,2008-05-17 21:38:00,537,"Congrats on another successful day's piking.  With the exception of the little squirt, certainly looks like they're getting bigger.  007"

203460,jediangler,2008-05-19 23:57:00,1923,Finally got the video I took of you guys up on Youtube. The music is a little known instrumental from REM called winged mammal theme that was considered but rejected for the Batman movie. Here's the link.
