203719,lew,2008-05-20 14:50:00,12767,"I need a new bed for my tent and found this cot on the BPS website and it looks like what I'm after.  I like a big solid bed and this one is 89"" x 40"" wide so it should work well.  It's a Redhead model & BPS Vaughn has them in stock for $100  Anybody use one ??  "
203722,Fang,2008-05-20 14:55:00,1330,"Yep Lew, Actually quite comfy. In colder weather you'd be best to add a thermal foam pad. I found it a little cold close to the floor.  I've also been looking at these and found a offbeat Bed,Bath and Home place called Jysk. They sell the standard Green cot, identical to the one at BPS for $49. A little smaller at 75x26""  http://www.jysk.ca/ProductDetails.aspx?id=...;prodid=9008003"
203724,fishing n autograph,2008-05-20 15:01:00,2540,Lew....did the little missus kick you out of the house again????
203726,bpsbassman,2008-05-20 15:02:00,941,I've got one Lew and its been great.  I usually put an extra sleeping bag under the one I'm sleeping in just for a little padding.  You can also get accessories that attach to the side with lots of pockets to hold all your stuff.  Mine fits in the back of my van and it makes a nice little setup back there.
203727,lew,2008-05-20 15:02:00,12767," Thanks Bud, that's what I wanted to hear.  I'll stick with the BPS model though as I like an extra wide & long bed."
203728,BITEME,2008-05-20 15:03:00,1969,Had a simalar deal Lew it lasted about 15 years you might want to get a mat of some sort to put under the feet so it does not bore holes into your tent
203729,lew,2008-05-20 15:05:00,12767,"Thanks to you too Roger & Pete, we were posting at the same time.  And Dave, she actually helps me pack but I don't know if that's a hint or not"
