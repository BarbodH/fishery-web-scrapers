203608,Riparian,2008-05-20 11:34:00,269," That sounds like a plan. If it offends you, or might be dangerous, lets censor it.  That way we will all be safe."
203233,fishing n autograph,2008-05-19 11:08:00,2540,Should be shot with roman candles at point blank range...........  I've never been so busy in my life as I was last night....every possible kid was firing off fireworks...  And why is it that everyone has a problem with people setting off fireworks safely in their backyards???      i'm going to bed......
203235,Clampet,2008-05-19 11:12:00,1947,The Chinese did a long time ago.
203236,Terry,2008-05-19 11:40:00,14456,yup they should be banned
203238,Clampet,2008-05-19 11:42:00,1947, You want to ban the Chinese?!!
203240,Terry,2008-05-19 11:46:00,14456,"yeah, you got it......                      LOL  great another thread that gets locked    trouble maker  I meant fireworks should be banned"
203241,Big Cliff,2008-05-19 11:51:00,6899,"If fireworks hadn't been invented, we wouldn't have guns!  I have however seen some really stupid use of fire works, about two years ago there were three young fellows racing around out here in boats firing roman candles at each other. You have to wonder what they were thinking; gas tank + fire ball in a boat..... could have easily = someone getting seriously hurt or killed."
203242,Clampet,2008-05-19 11:52:00,1947," Whew, I was really worried there fer a minute, I could picture CCMT getting very upset, and getting even with you in a fist fight or worse, a gun battle.  I am so relieved you bear no ill will against our Chinese brethren.  Maybe you're not the scoundrel many say you are."
203252,Tarzan's Jane,2008-05-19 13:37:00,1183,I love fireworks.
203285,kuhaman,2008-05-19 16:16:00,503,My dog is so scared of fireworks he hasnt been outside for 2 days. He must have a really big bladder.
203293,Nanook,2008-05-19 16:37:00,565,Dont believe that for a minute. Check all the corners in your house and furniture
203294,kuhaman,2008-05-19 16:42:00,503," Good idea, I thought my house was starting to smell a bit funky."
203358,Fisherman,2008-05-19 19:32:00,7201,
203418,Billy Bob,2008-05-19 22:32:00,5865,"Hey, if you ban the Chinese where am I going to get my Chinese food ? ? ?"
203428,Clampet,2008-05-19 22:57:00,1947, I suppose Terry hadn't taken into consideration the consequences of getting rid of all the Chinese.
203466,Gerritt,2008-05-20 00:09:00,6129,"Uhmmmm... Clamp-It I think you're taking this a bit far.. Terry is a great guy and the last person to judge a person by his or her race...  Perhaps you're trying to stir the pot or you have a genuine problem with Terry... if the later is the case, might I suggest taking it to PM with him personally... as you are trying to call out a respect member of this forum and alot of people that do not know him could read into you're posts that he is Racist. Which is certainly not the case..  This attack is uncalled for in my opinion as we all know what he is trying to convey.  G"
203471,muskymike,2008-05-20 00:21:00,772,  Where is Stoty when you need him
203472,Riparian,2008-05-20 00:23:00,269,im thinking he was joking Gerrit.
203473,Gerritt,2008-05-20 00:24:00,6129,  Let's Hope  G
203478,muskymike,2008-05-20 00:32:00,772,"Way to ruin the fun G. Thanks, i have nothing now"
203479,Gerritt,2008-05-20 00:34:00,6129,"Sorry Mike.... Blame the weather, the rain, the freaking snow!!!... or blame the fact I fought our way home along Hwy 11 and the 400...  Grrrr..... yes the rage is strong.. I better Shower tonight... and the wife will hopefully be accommodating.  G"
203481,muskymike,2008-05-20 00:37:00,772,I specifically avoided traffic this weekend. Went to the states instead.  I understand G. Maybe hit up Valley Park with the kid(s) for the show if they are still on. Have fun if you do.  Mike
203482,Tarzan's Jane,2008-05-20 00:39:00,1183, A shower will certainly help      Hope you get some
203544,nautifish,2008-05-20 02:33:00,1416,"I think fireworks and those bloody sparklers should be both banned.   I think that fireworks should only be allowed to be used in places where it is controlled by professionals  & on such days as  canada day, victoria day what ever.  Here in dover they put on a fire work display on canada day at the end of the peir . The peir is roped off and there are professional ,fireman and ambulance all present incase something should go wrong.  They do not allow any of the public on the peir at this time and i think thats how all events should be.  They are Explosives plain and simple.  I beleive that fire works are now banned in the UK The public can no longer buy them.  Guy fawks was allways a crazy night over there  for the Emergency crews and hospitals.  It was ridiculous ever yr children and adults getting hands blown off severe burns u name it.  A few years ago here in dover a very young grl was holding a sparkler she was six yrs old and was being watched by her grandfather .  A hot amber from the sparkler caught on Her dress and her dress was in flames with in seconds.   She had 2nd & 3rd degree burns all over her body was in the hospital for  months in London, has had many skin graphs and other corrective sugery and this was from one simple sparkler.  One of the local bars here on town did a couple of fund raisers for the family which i think was great.  I like to go watch fire works also but only at such places or event as they do here on the peir in dover.  I have never had any interest to buy fire works and bring them home to let off in my back garden.  So yes they should be banned totally banned for use by the public & only used by professional in a controlled & safe enviroment."
203593,Clampet,2008-05-20 08:05:00,1947," Of course! I thought that was obvious.  Can you imagine Cliff getting upset, over that foolishness. "
203603,Chris,2008-05-20 11:06:00,405,"I got an idea.....why don't we just ban everything in the world and all live virtual lives on our computer....that way, nobody in the world will ever get hurt, offended, outraged, angered, etc.   ......ban, ban, ban......BAN  I think the word ban should be banned."
