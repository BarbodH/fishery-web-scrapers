203898,SlowPoke,2008-05-20 20:09:00,2984,No need to leave the GTA for great fishing. You'll come across some great reports from the islands and nearby if you do a little reading.

203913,tibbs,2008-05-20 20:19:00,650,  I'm with slowpoke with this one.  There are great fishing spots around Lake Ontario with a lot of different species of fish.  Go out and explore!
203994,charlied,2008-05-20 22:19:00,584,there is always the lower Niagara river in the summer for bass...anywhere in the Glen and whirlpool areas produce tons of bass.
