203085,kelvarnson,2008-05-18 20:29:00,15,"First boat outing of the year, and was chasing an agressive walleye bite on Rice.  While not as hot as I'd heard the opener was, still did pretty well.  Worked emerging weeds near deep water, caught all my fish on a bucktail jig (no live bait).  Was out 9:30 to 3, caught 5 eyes between 2 and 5 pounds (kept 2 of the smallest) and 3 O/S bass (1 SM, 2 LM)  Weather was perfect; overcast with a very light wind.      "
