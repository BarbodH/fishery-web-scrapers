203468,Canuck2fan,2008-05-20 00:15:00,1444,I was going to go pike fishing but when the weather was cold wet and windy. I went into work for 5 hrs at my part time job so I bascially have to work about 12 hours from now till Friday at both jobs. I considered it a good investment of time on account of the weather today.
203503,forrest,2008-05-20 01:13:00,1032, I called a local Legend/Mercury dealer.....they picked up the phone...I did not expect that and asked my question.
