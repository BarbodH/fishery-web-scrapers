203183,kingofthesteelhead,2008-05-19 03:03:00,140,I am sure a few of you saw the coverage of the accident down towards Warkworth where three young girls were killed in a  car accident Friday evening.Well I was awakened Saturday morning by a knock on the door of my trailer and looking out I see it is my nephew Mark. I find out that my sister's daughter was involved in that accident where a transport truck t-boned the car and all three girls were dead at the scene. Not a very way to start off the weekend.
