202442,johnnyb,2008-05-16 00:44:00,3413,"Hey all -- on my trip to Temagami and some of the small back lakes next week (can't believe it's almost here!) I want to bring a couple of small lake/gang trolls with me....any suggestions on what to tip them with?  I suppose a minnow would be the obvious choice, but live bait may not be the most convenient up there.  A tube jig?  Fly? If anybody has a suggestion, I'd love to hear it"
202445,Sinker,2008-05-16 00:50:00,8692,Marshmallow?
202446,johnnyb,2008-05-16 00:53:00,3413,LOL -- well I will definitely have those with me....could be worth a shot
202447,Sinker,2008-05-16 00:55:00,8692,"seriously, a minnow is my first choice. After that, any thing goes. I've even run them with worm harnesses off them for inland 'bows.  Sinker"
202448,johnnyb,2008-05-16 00:57:00,3413,well...I MIGHT bring the minnow trap...will probably have some worms....I'm thinking a tube jig fluttering along back there could do nicely.  maybe I could stuff the tube with some mallow??
202449,Sinker,2008-05-16 00:59:00,8692,I have good luck with berkley power nuggets stuffed in my tubes.....lol.  A Berkley power minnow or  similar will work just as well. Load up on plastics.  Sinker
202453,Greencoachdog,2008-05-16 01:17:00,8163,I was thinkin' a jig and Gulp grub if live bait isn't an option.
202457,CLofchik,2008-05-16 01:20:00,854,"What's wrong with a smaller ""peanut"" like they run for Lake O lakers?"
202466,johnnyb,2008-05-16 01:29:00,3413,Sounds good....what is it?
202471,CLofchik,2008-05-16 01:34:00,854," A little foam thing that looks like a 1 1/2"" J-Plug.  Y'know I don't even know what it's real name is, lol. All the trolling guys I talk to swear by the thing for lakers though."
202474,johnnyb,2008-05-16 01:38:00,3413,"Ohhhhh, I know the thing!  I've also seen little jobbys similar to that with wings on 'em...sort of a pimped out worm harness/ Thanks CLofchik.  I will add it to the shopping list for tomorrow"
203008,Clampet,2008-05-18 12:53:00,1947,Gang trolls are supposed to imitate a school of minnows.
