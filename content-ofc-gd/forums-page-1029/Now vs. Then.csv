202736,Clampet,2008-05-16 22:44:00,1947,"Sad too, in the sense that it would have been a better time to be in your early twenties back then (50's 60's). Oh sure, technology is more advanced, we drive fancier cars, etc, but the quality of day to day living has really, IMHO, deteriorated immensely."

203382,holdfast,2008-05-19 20:27:00,1813,"Maybe funny but so true.  -Got the strap in school, no problem, felt like an outcast for a few days but learned my lesson.  Fought after school instead of during after that -Got beat up by more than one Frenchman when I was a kid.  Cried to Pops but gave me a whack and told me Id get it worse if I came     home crying again.  Too easy, stood up for myself after that. - Tried to score many times by making the first attempt, sometimes it worked.  Wouldn't think of doing it again if I was a teenager again, with all the Harassment issues. - Told my kid I would spank her Bum if she didnt behave, while in line at the checkout.  About a dozen women looked at me with an evil look. - Watched a father get carted away and questioned by the Police as a Predator, when all he was doing was sitting in his Van waiting for his kid who was late. I witnessed a Mother calling police.  After that avoided as much as possible picking up my kids without my wife with me. -Played football and British Bulldog during recess, and never cried when I got thumped.  Had students that came up to me and asked me.  Warrant should I go to the Base hospital because of this lump or bruise on my leg.  Looked at the young man and asked him if he ever had a fight or played sports. No just video games. - Now we have students with hidden tape recorders, and a notebook taking notes in order to cry harassment every time they feel like they've been done wrong.  OH and its always the INSTRUCTORS FAULT"
