203025,bigcreekdad,2008-05-18 13:34:00,546,I generally stick to smaller crankbaits and bucktails at beginning of season. I typically don't start topwater till mid season. Going to fish opening week on French River this year. Has anyone had any cnsistent success using topwaters early on?

203038,BillM,2008-05-18 14:56:00,17367,"I'll be throwing Magnum Zara Spooks and some TopRaiders for the early opener on the French  I'm a complete muskie newb, but from what I've read in books and online, early in the season is the time to be throwing topwater."
203069,Musky or Specks,2008-05-18 19:02:00,2710,Ive caught plenty of fish on the opener on JackPots and Docs. The only two types of baits I really use that week are topwaters and bulging bucktails.
203088,bucktail,2008-05-18 20:45:00,1857,"Might be a little slow this year starting out on Topwaters, the water is very cold this year, hopefully we get some heat and the fish become more active."
203152,outllaw,2008-05-19 01:44:00,1232,smaller cranks up high work best here on st clair. remember warmer water outflows like creeks opening to main lake is a choice to look at.
203157,Crazyhook,2008-05-19 01:54:00,1154,I have moved fish on the open on topwaters for sure... never a bad time to throw them... fish eat them from opener to mid november!
203158,ehg,2008-05-19 02:15:00,2666,"As is mentioned above, topwaters get a strike most of the season(except when real cold). The problem is the low hooking % with musky on topwaters. I('ll go shallow with bucktails to hook them.  ehg"
203175,Musky or Specks,2008-05-19 02:51:00,2710,Yes god knows Im lucky if I hook up 25% of the time on topwaters. Sure gets the heart going though!!
203246,F7Firecat,2008-05-19 12:32:00,347,"You can go with topwaters no problem,  got one last year on opener on a super topraider.  From what I hear the water is still a lilttle cold, muskies will still hit it.  Being cold water, then they may be still shallow and close to their spawning areas makinga topwater a great choice to throw."
203667,Pigeontroller,2008-05-20 13:19:00,2793,"If there are young of the year water fowl swimming, its Top-water time!"
203803,Rich,2008-05-20 17:56:00,3927,"Only time I ever raised a musky with a topwater bait (that wasn't under 30 inches"" was on opening day 2 years ago. And man was it ever big. I'll be doing a lot more of that this opener! God I can't wait. Cats and carp are great, but musky are where it's at!"
203925,Squid,2008-05-20 20:42:00,1656,  Where are you going to fish ?
204046,BillM,2008-05-20 23:46:00,17367,I'll be throwing topwaters + bucktails on the French for the June 7th opener... And probably every other new bait I've purchased in the last 6 months
