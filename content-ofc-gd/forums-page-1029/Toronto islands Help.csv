What is wrong this summer, are the temperatures too cold for the pike to come into the shallows?"

203737,capt bruce,2008-05-20 15:26:00,820,A little late . Ive been watching the pike in the harbor all spring and most of the large ones are gone for the summer some smaller ones still in the weed beds around ontario place and wards island but its a mater of you should of been there a few weeks ago .Lots of carp moveing in to spawn now and  some bull heads . There are a population of smaller pike that stay all summer at the islands but the large spawners are gone .
