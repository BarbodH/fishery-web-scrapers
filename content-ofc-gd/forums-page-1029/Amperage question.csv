203439,Cast-Away,2008-05-19 23:30:00,790,I was wondering if anyone knows how many amps the alternator puts out on a 75 hp 4 stroke Merc when cruising?
203461,Fisherman,2008-05-20 00:02:00,7201,"When you check the Merc (Black Anchor) site, they should give it under the motor specs.  See here: http://www.mercurymarine.com/engines/outbo...specs.php?ID=77"
203462,Terry,2008-05-20 00:02:00,14456,"depending on the year, 20 to 50 amps"
