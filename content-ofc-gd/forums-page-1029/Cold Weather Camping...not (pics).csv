Although the fishing was rather horrible, 1 small pike, 1 very small pickeral and a couple of OOS smallies.  The weather was beautiful on Saturday, but very cold at night with lots of rain the last day.  The first trip of the year is always exciting.....here's some pics  The road into the lake....     Over the winter I purchased a rather large 4 season tent from Cabelas with a wood stove...no more roughing it.....       Here's a couple of more scenery pics..        We has an awesome time..... 4 days left until our annual trip north of Cochrane for some huge pike.....can't wait  Jason"

And Cliff as you know I am very allergic to the bugs.....no more trips to the hospital for me  Hey Mike....you are correct my fiancee is a trooper to the extreme.....she knew the cold and rain was coming for Sunday/Monday...and she was the one who wanted to stick it out....I am so lucky.
