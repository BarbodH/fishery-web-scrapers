198682,Cory,2008-05-08 15:37:00,170,I see the pinned thread is gone.....who goes on the sign?
198770,bigfish1965,2008-05-08 19:06:00,3382,Thread is set to invisible as TJ is up at the camp tending to things. Don't know what pic won or if he has even decided yet.
198775,Roy,2008-05-08 19:16:00,13728,He printed them all out and will ask Tookie to pick one on Saturday night.
198809,Cory,2008-05-08 21:07:00,170,"I thought he would use his profile picture, but that would scare too many away."
198916,Daplumma,2008-05-09 00:51:00,1961,"How can a guy with the name ""Tookie"" steer you wrong? Joe"
203706,Cory,2008-05-20 14:28:00,170,bump for the hedgehog.....
203708,TJQ,2008-05-20 14:33:00,7806,Well.... It comes down to this... I'm not sure I can afford to get a picture sign done....  turns out they want double what the original estimate was.  I'm debating what to do.  I can get a redo of the current sign for about 500 bucks which is much more in my price range... I will pick a winner though and at a minimum get some OFC swag out to them.  hedgehog.... hmmmfff...
