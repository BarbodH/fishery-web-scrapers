203992,spoonman,2008-05-20 22:13:00,103,"Friday I headed down to Toronto Islands with a client to do some pike fishing. The water was a little colder than I expected with 53.7 being the warmest we found. With the cooler weather in the past few weeks the weeds are not exactly growing fast. We started the day of using some Rapala Huskys in different sizes and colors. We finally saw a nice pike swimming just under the surface. The Pike was not interested in our baits so, we changed spots in hope of more fish. The day was going fairly slow so I went back to where we saw the Pike. About the 3rd cast in, bang, hookup.  It was a decent size Pike for a slow day.  Steve was very happy with his first Lake Ontario Pike.   With some warmer water temps the Pike should only get more active. Cheers AL"

204165,ehg,2008-05-21 02:51:00,2666,Those cold temps and lack of weedcover might explain the lack of reports from the Toronto waterfront. Nice pike and thanks for report. Better days should be ahead.  ehg
204171,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-21 02:58:00,0,Nice Pike! Lake O has a good population of big pike. And most people don't target them. There has to be some real monsters in there.
