203827,The Urban Fisherman,2008-05-20 18:37:00,2050,"The resevoir opened up for the season this weekend and with bad weather an plenty of work to get done around the house I was only able to sneak out for a couple hours Monday morning.  Fished a micro jig for panfish the first hour or so and managed a mixed bag of rock bass, perch, bluegill and OOS largies.  For the most part the bigger bluegill have already moved back out into deeper water.  Any weed edge produced a few fish.  Eventually my hands couldn't take the cold anymore and I decided to try trolling for bow's.  With ZERO experience I tied a 4lb fluoro leader onto my 7' spinning rod and tied a 2"" original floating rap to the end.  Started trolling, just poured myself a warm cup of coffee was about to take my first sip and my rod goes nuts, drop the coffee and reel in my first ever trolling rainbow - a perfectly pan sized 17 incher! Put up a decent fight on light tackle.   Next up was this suicidal bluegill.   Fished for another 45 minutes - had three more hits but only landed 1 more bow.   Cleaned them up and had fresh fish on the BBQ for dinner.  It was my first time keeping, or eating rainbow trout.  One fish had a much stronger taste than the other.  Could 1 be a stocker and the other a home-grown?   Anyways - it was a short outing, and I look forward to learning more about trolling for these little resevoir trout. Any tips are welcome!   Cheers, UF"
