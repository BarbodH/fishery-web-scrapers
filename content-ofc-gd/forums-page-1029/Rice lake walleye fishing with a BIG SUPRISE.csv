Headed out to Rice for some Walleye action Saturday morning...within the first five minutes of trolling I get a monster hit....This thing was peeling line for a good 30 seconds....We thought we had a record walleye on the line seeing as how pike and muskie are pretty much extinct on this lake.....I got its head up and caught eye with a brute OOS muskie.....Picked it up quickly to take the hook out and snapped a pic before releasing it.....not even 10 seconds of reviving and she was off....We trolled some new area's and did well for the three or so hours we had to fish before the storm hit...managed 7 good size walleye (lost one at the boat) and one accidental muskie...Who would of thought a Giant muskie like that would be hitting a fast running 2"" crank bait in 55 degree water !!! Nothing seezes to amaze me anymore !!!   "
203569,linweir,2008-05-20 03:43:00,202,"These eyes were caught by 2"" crankbait?"
203588,jediangler,2008-05-20 06:35:00,1923,Nice eyes. That's some good eatin' there.
203597,mbac31,2008-05-20 09:35:00,904,Nice fish. Muskie are far from being extinct on that lake. he sots are everywhere.
203610,BillM,2008-05-20 11:56:00,17367,"Rice is full of muskies, like most of the Kawartha lakes.  Not giants per say, but they make up for it in numbers."
203612,ccmtcanada,2008-05-20 11:58:00,7971,Great stuff!!  Always nice to have a surprise like that!
203627,Stoty,2008-05-20 12:22:00,2910,"I agree, lots of Musky's on Rice  Some nice eyes though, mmmmmm tasty! Good job."
203664,brooks999,2008-05-20 13:14:00,38,Nice fish...  Rice has produced well for me this year for Walleyes....Have caught a couple each time I have gone out. (Released them All)  Have yet to stumble upon any big hits that may be Muskie....Would enjoy that though  better hope danbo doesn't see that picture of the muskie.  You fish there often?
203685,danbo,2008-05-20 13:52:00,2646,I see it!...... nice stringer of pickerel though!
203689,jdmls,2008-05-20 13:59:00,575,"I guess they meant Muskie were just rare on this particular side of the lake.....yup small 2.5"" crank baits.....I usually just fish Rice for Walleye in the spring"
203802,Rich,2008-05-20 17:54:00,3927,"Nice 'eyes! Great to see Rice is still producing walleye. Slowed down there for a couple of years (for me anyway). Not that I've ever tried, I didn't really tangle with too many incidental muskies there. I always thought it was a poor musky numbers lake. Guess I'm wrong!"
