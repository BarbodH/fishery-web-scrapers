I spent a few hours tossing husky jerks for pike, in high cold water. No luck at all for the past few days. Just about to leave i tried slow rolling the shoreline with a spinnerbait. First cast, fish on. Maybe 5fow. Felt like maybe i hooked a stick, the a good head shake. Made me think mid 30's pike, until I got the barrel roll. Damn its a big walleye. Fought like a beast after that, i was thinking ten plus. Got it to shore, gave it a good look,  fish was about 7.5 -8lbs, plopped the hook then release. End of my day. Beauty lake walleye, nice clean colour, fat as all heck. But no eggs and not even a puckered butt. This year is gonna be brutal. Water temps still only 39. Just thought id share"

852124,SmokestackLightnin,2014-05-05 18:18:00,390,Walleye spawn is on right now on the Upper Pickeral River.  The Argyle Fish and Game club started to net spawners for their hatchery on Saturday.   Season opens May 17th so the spawn will be over by then.

852133,manitoubass2,2014-05-05 19:03:00,11391,I'm not too sure about how long it takes for walleye eggs to mature to the right size before depositing?(something to look into) but my bud on rainy lake said their about half the size they should be. Water temps here on the river are still at 39 degrees. At what point does time triumph conditions for the spawn? I'm watching my area closely to try to learn. Everything I've noted says 43-45 degrees and its on. Very possible those temps have been reached downriver at wheelers/LOTW
