851911,mike rousseau,2014-05-04 17:51:00,4661,Hello everyone...  GPS stopped working...  Unit is HB 597 ci hd di...  It was fine Friday night/Saturday morning...  Then today I had nothing... I fished for 3 hours and it never got a signal....  In the system screen it shows the GPS is connected...  Any ideas...?  If the reciever wasn't working would it still show connected...?  I updated the most recent software and it didn't fix it...  I put it on the portable pack and nada...  Please help...  Also looking for humminbird repairs as close to Cornwall/Ottawa/Montreal as possible... In case it doesn't get going again ...  Thanks
851914,mike rousseau,2014-05-04 18:09:00,4661,Nevermind...  Picked up signal in the driveway after 2-3 hours...

852600,bawbag,2014-05-08 08:52:00,48,I have the same unit and encountered the same problem. Only my signal never came back. Seems to be pretty common with the internal gps in these things just crapping out. Contacted humminbird  and they want you to ship to their repair center in North bay if I can remember correctly.
852605,mike rousseau,2014-05-08 11:11:00,4661,So sometimes I'm getting signal...  Sometimes no signal....  It's been on for 20 minutes today and still nothing...  So again I'm back to looking for a place to repair it... I'd prefer not to ship it to north bay for a month cause I need it to fish...  Is there anywhere in Ottawa/Montreal areas I can get it fixed...???

Bay Distributors is well known for the fast turn around on repaired HB units Mike and you may have it back in just a few days, at least that's the way it used to be. I once sent a unit to them and had it back in 3 days."
