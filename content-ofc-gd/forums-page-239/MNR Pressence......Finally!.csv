This thread shows CO's on one river, famous for blatant fisheries violations on the biggest day of the year for it...where exactly is the issue?  I get the whole issue of misuse of revenue generation and not going into the fisheries but it seems like you're literally huffing and puffing over any MNR enforcement of old and well-established regulations as if it's some hidden corporate agenda to fleece all the outdoorsman.  I'd like to hear a CO chime in on that"
851639,moxie,2014-05-03 01:31:00,1566,He was watching us eh? In the dark right? Those x-ray specs would certainly allow them to see through my pants and wallet to see my license and what was being kept in those white buckets the other anglers brought with them. Swallow what you will but I prefer to spit instead. Lessens the probability of infection.

851643,Joeytier,2014-05-03 01:49:00,3990,"So in essence, it is completely fruitless to enforce our regulations and penalize people for illegally and negatively impacting our fisheries if the money doesnt feed directly into the resources?  I'm as disgruntled as anyone over squandered funds but you must at least see te merit in enforcement?"

The creek was absolutely full of pike and there were up to 30 people ""scooping"" them out of the creek even though the season is closed.. Some volunteers from The Royal Botanical Gardens came along and removed over 1000 pike and relocated them to Cootes Paradise, with the blessing of the MNR... again, why no enforcement or charges??"

850821,Andrak,2014-04-29 02:28:00,1,I saw them too. Walked straight up to me and asked to see my gear and license. Talking to him after he said that he gave out many fines that day.
850823,Gallie,2014-04-29 02:33:00,1215,"I was very happy to see them out by my house, i have never seen so many people fishing ""crappie"" in my canal it was unreal. I saw one guy keep at least double his limit, most people dragging anchors through spawn beds while drifting, many others tying off to peoples docks and properties without permission. One guy went from chucking a rubber frog to a 6 inch rapala (hmmmm....) another guy was chucking a massive reef runner spinnerbait and when i told him pike and bass are not in season he switched to his decoy panfish setup hahaha. My brain hurts from explaining the rules to people and my throat is hoarse from yelling at them. I called mnr about the poachers and the over limit guy and they came in the truck a couple times but the shore fisherman were mostly legal. The boat guys were ridiculous.  Anyways, for revenue or otherwise its nice to see them keeping these morons on their toes, i hope they launch the boat next year because they will make a killing lol.  On a side note there are no crappie left in my canal havent caught one in days( wonder why)"

With the influx of new Canadians over the last twenty years or so it would have been advantageous to see the MNR step up to the plate and show the full force then. Better late than never doesn't fly with government agencies considering they have the resources to head issues off at the pass. Just like the cop ticketing blitzes to meet quotas this is a cash grab pure and simple. Glass half empty? Maybe but at least I'm not easily fooled or appeased by false pretenses."

I know that my zone has maybe 1-2 changes per year and I'm capable enough to locate it over the intra-net, but I like the regs book for bathroom reading material and have never had a problem locating one.

850995,chessy,2014-04-29 21:18:00,610,if i was present i would have certainly said something .. i would have first tried to contact our local police force  (port hope) they would have been there in a flash unless something big was happening .. but i have confronted my fair share of guys over the years... i gave a guy a heads up earlier in the day about fishing in the sanctuary i asked him if he could read English and he went off on me for being a racist  i said i don't care if your asian black white green or purple i ask every one that question when your fishing under signs that are 3 foot by 2 foot.... cause if your fishing next to them you can't.. his response to me was i can more than afford a 2000 dollar fine for fishing here ....but he soon left when i continuously called him a poacher so ever one down steam could hear me... he tried to be the tough guy but he thought twice ... most guys if you embrase them they will fold

Anyhow, i always like seeing the MNR out doing there job, i appreciate that. I can see where moxie is coming from(as well as others), and I'm personally pretty darn close to sharing the same views as him. As for the guy with a gaff, I'd assume he was native and thats a darned tough one to approach. Sort of like calling a guy out on a hunting infraction while he's holding a rifle. Dont be stupid and get yourself harmed over a fishing offence, as mad as it makes us all. And again, he may well be within his right do do so?"

MNR=General Revenue and its been that way for a very long time.  The guys and gals out in the field do great work and have a daunting task but if you pick their brain a bit you might just be able to get the real facts. The directive has been passed down.

Instead of posting links of articles or news flashes of people getting busted and how great a job their doing(You're doing their work for them by advertising, They're using you guys) why don't you guys post some backbone and let them know you see right through their charade.

We were fishing from shore last night and there were approx 15-20 people there. CO performed the slow drive by, made a u-turn and left without even asking how the fishing was. Why bother coming around putting wear and tear on our truck and wasting our fuel?   Oh I know. There weren't any cameras and/or reporters. See my point now? When I punch the clock I bust my hump the whole 10-11 hours I'm there. Why? Cause it is what I'm paid to do."
