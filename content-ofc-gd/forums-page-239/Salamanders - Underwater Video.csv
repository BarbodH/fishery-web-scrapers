851539,mattybculp,2014-05-02 17:23:00,388,cool video. I love salamanders I used to catch em and keep em as pets. I loved all the different colours I could find them in. good bait for sure.
851552,jimmer,2014-05-02 18:51:00,2730,You found the mother load! I used to find them in the bellies of brookies and splake that I caught in Algonquin Park. I don't think that you can legally use them as bait though.
851555,Musky or Specks,2014-05-02 18:53:00,2710,Very cool video thanks
851557,blaque,2014-05-02 19:16:00,2419,"Very cool.........love me some salamander huntin. The kids always get a kick out of them  Too cute to use as bait,......i could never"
851668,musky666,2014-05-03 11:10:00,126,"Wow, we used to catch some on rocky shorelines of Oxtongue Lake when I was a kid, never seen anything like that however. I am sure that like all amphibians they are under stress, hope no one is using them as bait, legally or otherwise."

851855,Skud,2014-05-04 05:13:00,739,My sons and I witnessed the same thing in my Dads pond a few weeks ago. They were the salamanders with the blue dots on them. I caught a couple so the kids could have a closer look. The branches nearby had thousands of eggs on them. Cute critters for sure. Great video
851862,mattybculp,2014-05-04 10:25:00,388,"Just want to make clear that I have never used them as bait, just simply stating that they would be good bait as I'm sure fish don't mind eating them."
851899,123chadder,2014-05-04 16:01:00,165,i dont think its illegal to use salamanders for bait in canada
852224,John Bacon,2014-05-06 02:23:00,3277,i dont think its illegal to use salamanders for bait in canada  It is illegal to use them as bait in Ontario.  I am not sure about the rest of Canada.
