852478,BillM,2014-05-07 18:37:00,17367,Pike will usually spawn under the ice in a lot of cases.  I didn't think Couch had a big population of pike anyhow.

852501,LefroyFisherman,2014-05-07 20:21:00,602,At the perch fest last weekend I saw a couple of pikes cruising around in the marina's but it looked like they didn't have much interest in feeding just yet.
