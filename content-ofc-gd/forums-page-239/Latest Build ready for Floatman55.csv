851146,bare foot wader,2014-04-30 17:16:00,1354,agreed on the 8136 and thanks for the info...that is one heck of a build!!!
851153,Headhunter,2014-04-30 17:30:00,5703,"Nice job as usual Chris... can't help but think I would ruin that fancy wood in short time, trying to stick a hook in there! LOL I know you use well sourced woods Chris, but I don't know if you or others are aware of CITES. There has been an international push to protect difficult to source wood species and as a result, you could find yourself in trouble should a well meaning border agent spot what they ""believe"" to be ""exotic"" wood. They can and will be confiscated... Here's some info that is oriented more toward guitars/musical instruments, but I think you will see that it could be relevant for fishing equipment as well. Not trying to scare anyone, just trying to make aware. www.aphis.usda.gov/import_export/plants/manuals/ports/downloads.pdf  HH"
851221,Bill Shearer,2014-04-30 21:54:00,456,"The Koa that Chris used, was purchased by me, from sources in Hawaii. Those sources certify that as Koa is a protected species, only dead, or diseased trees are harvested. The state of Hawaii is very aggressive in protecting it's native species, and the fines are very punitive for those that dare. The pieces I purchased are advertised on Ebay, and the HI DEC monitor all sales. As much as I love the wood, I would not want to cross them."

851346,Headhunter,2014-05-01 13:04:00,5703,"Good that the wood was purchased legally... I was simply trying to make folks aware that they may run into trouble crossing into the US or into Canada, with ""exotic"" wood. The border dudes are trying their best, but they are not experts in wood and could in all probability, cause you grief. Confiscation comes to mind. Sorry for the derail Chris, I think your work is 2nd to none! HH"
851450,Fish Farmer,2014-05-02 00:57:00,2234,I think a few MINNOW Scales would add a little finishing touch. :-)
851947,Spiel,2014-05-04 20:17:00,9065,"Thanks again all.  Good that the wood was purchased legally...

Sorry for the derail Chris, I think your work is 2nd to none! HH  No worries Bud, I don't see a ""derail"" just an opportunity to learn something I hadn't been aware of. Book marked the link for future reading. Thank you.   I think a few MINNOW Scales would add a little finishing touch. :-)  Define a few for me Dave as I've seen the millions on your rod (I presume your an extremist).....LOL"
850296,Spiel,2014-04-26 19:51:00,9065,"The latest completed rod out of the shop is for Floatman55. It was a bit of an undertaking with all the involved requests but in the end it came out quite nice. Both Floatman55 and I are happy with the end results.  Here's a wee bit of how it came together....  The wood is figured Koa, came to me as a 10"" long block by 1.5"" square. Here it is roughly rounded and oiled to see the grain....     After several hours of shaping sanding and finishing it became this. It's fitted with solid titanium hardware from Lemke (top shelf components bar none!).    Here's a look at the rest of the wood components before installation on the blank....      Handle now on the Sage One 6126-4 blank....         And finally the now finished rod. Titanium Fuji guides to compliment the Lemke Titanium reel seat with black wraps and metallic pewter trim to tie it all together....         Cheers"

850970,Spiel,2014-04-29 20:04:00,9065,Thanks guys.  Here's another piece of Koa (fiddle back grain) going on Floatman55's buddies rod in the next day or two.    
850973,misfish,2014-04-29 20:10:00,29133,I wish I could run into an angler using one of these.  Nice work as always.

851120,fishnsled,2014-04-30 14:57:00,3520,Works of art Spiel!!
851130,bare foot wader,2014-04-30 15:45:00,1354,"with that blank, and all titanium components, interested to know what the finished weight is?  I fell in love with the One 8136 spey factory stick, insanely light and it could be custom built lighter I'd bet....the wallet would also be lighter lol"
851140,Bill Shearer,2014-04-30 16:41:00,456,"That's a great question! The weight of the rod plus components totals 8.45 ounces. 23"" cork handle, Koa seat and trim, solid titanium Lemke reel seat, Fuji tysg guides, thread and epoxy. That is actually .3 of an ounce less than a similarly built 4-8 13'6"" CTS! An added bonus is the fact the rod has significantly more power than the CTS. It should be a real winner! Just waiting for the freaking rain to stop, so I can really give it a test. The Sage One 8136 is high gradient BC big river perfect. It weighs less than this 6 wt built as a float rod. The Sage One blanks are about half the cost of the factory rods."
