They've been launching float planes that way for decades.. but for some reason this video is making the rounds as the latest greatest idea. I've done a couple in the yard launching them off my 32' flat bed. Easy part is getting the truck up to 50 mph in the first 1000 feet... the hard part is stopping the truck and 4000lb trailer on a grass 2% grade in the next 1000 feet, before I crash into the forest at the end of the strip.  Was a guy in Collingwood that use to take off AND land his Beaver onto a moving trailer, until Transport Canada claimed he was endangering the driver of the truck (which he wasn't in any way)"
