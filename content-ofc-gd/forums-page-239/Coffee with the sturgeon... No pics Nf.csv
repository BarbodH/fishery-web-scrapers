Plan this morning was to have coffee on the deck and watch these majestic creatures jumping throughout the river. Pretty chilly this am but the river is glass:) i hear birds all over, watching loons chase the baitfish, in between those sounds come large splashes of the mighty sturgeon. Mostly smaller fish so far, but a few big ones too! Pelicans already poised at the rapids, and on a steep rock on the American side, awaiting a feed. Two bald eagles are also out this am, and one hawk:) coffee is good, life is good:) good morning OFC"
