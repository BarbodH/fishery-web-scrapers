851542,Shloim,2014-05-02 17:26:00,515,Interested in taking the kids out for some pan fishing on easy water close to Toronto. Kids have a short attention span so easy access and good numbers would be nice. If anyone can recommend something I would appreciate it. I'll keep it quiet and never keep anything anyway. PM me if you like and I greatly appreciate it!
