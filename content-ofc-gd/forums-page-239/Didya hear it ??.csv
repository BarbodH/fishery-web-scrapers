851964,lew,2014-05-04 22:25:00,12766,I live north of Peterboro near Burliegh Falls and about 4:20 this afternoon we heard a loud rumbling sound that lasted a couple seconds. Didn't know what the heck it was but a couple neighbors also heard it and we even got a call from friends 15 miles away.  Turns out it was a huge meteor breaking the sound barrier (obviously) and then blowing apart that was evidently seen by alot of folks.

851966,Parnelly,2014-05-04 22:27:00,108,"Yep, heard that loud and clear. Was wondering what it was until about half hour ago when we noticed the news reports.  Edit: Im in the west end of Peterborough."
851972,Weeds,2014-05-04 23:02:00,782,I sure did! Thought it was an earthquake or a tree falling on the house! I went outside to see what was up but there was nobody around to ask if they had heard or felt anything.
851978,bushart,2014-05-04 23:19:00,2628,Not sure if anybody has been followin this but seems to be more frequent these past few months of sightings---quite a few on the east coast  hopefully we don't see what Russia had across the sky--a while back  Bruce Willis---assemble the crew

852242,pidge,2014-05-06 05:06:00,438,"On topic did anyone happen to catch the huge fireball explosion in the sky last week. Forgive me on the actual date, but it happen around 2:30-3:30am between April 27-28 I can't remember the exact date. I went out for a Kate night smoke, just happened to look up and saw a very not so normal shooting star. Shooting stars to me look like a white light similar to a star. This thing was red/orange and exploded or broke apart sending hundreds of smaller red/orange pieces flying in the same direction as it was first heading. I saw this in standing in aproximetlly the middle of Brampton and it seemed to been moving over the Beampton/Woodbridge border in a South direction towards Lake Ontario. If I had to guess Id say it likely landed in the lake. Around the same time as this was happening I also heard a roar which sounded like an airplane, but not an air plane. It sounded very distant. Something I've never heard before, but an airplane sorta describes it best. I've asked a few people, but no one knows of it or anything. Anyone else seen this exploding fireball around this date and time. Btw the sky's were very clear that night and this thing stood out in the dark morning sky."
