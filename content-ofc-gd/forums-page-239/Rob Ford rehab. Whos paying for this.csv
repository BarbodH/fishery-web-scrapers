And those two statments are so far from the truth it hurts!  The fact that he has finally admitted that he has a problem and is seeking help goes a long way in my books. I don't support Rob Ford and I don't like some of the things he has done but I do give him credit for finally admitting that he does have a problem and I do give him credit for trying to get help to deal with it. I truly hope he is successful not only for his sake but for his families sake too!  Now if we could only get Justin Beber to follow the same path, he has all the basics down pat (drugs, drinking, lies, assault) but he is still idolized by so many and refuses to admit that he has a problem!  Cliff, do you think a 30 day stint in rehab is going to cure or even curb his addictions? Addicts will admit that it takes a lot longer than 30 days to subside the cravings of crack cocaine. Will the rehab address his bigotry, racism or sexism?? All this rehab stint is doing is making him look good for the upcoming election, as others have said. As for those who claim people on here think they are perfect and we are criticizing Ford because of our shortcomings, give me a break. I am far from perfect but I don't hold the position of mayor of the largest city in Canada. I am not in a position to influence large crowds of people or have children, other than my own, look up to me. I am not on the news daily with my ""imperfections"" taking center stage. If you are in the public eye, as politicians are, you will be held to a higher standard. Smoking crack, being a bigot and racist will not be accepted. Is this kicking him while he is down? The man is a bully and has been since he was younger. I worked with a guy that went to high school with Rob and Doug. I have heard the stories and you see it in his actions. He has brought this all on himself. If he didn't want the criticism and backlash he should not have behaved as he has while holding the position he holds.  Just look at last weekend with Donald Sterling of the NBA. There is no room for this behavior in society.  I do feel sorry for his kids, it is too bad really.  As for Beiber... where do you start."
851848,Duckie,2014-05-04 03:41:00,305,"the one thing that has really bugged me about the whole Ford story is that for months before the proof of the crack video, Ford was attacking the media claiming they were lying, it was a witch hunt, slander etc etc etc.  and it was all true and they were correct in their reporting all along.  where is Ford's apology to the media?"

851872,woodenboater,2014-05-04 12:49:00,2277,"Sorry all but imo, if he can't even stick to his efforts to lose weight (to much self promoted fanfare) then this is even more of an uphill battle. I would love to see him get better for the sake of his kids but I'm not expecting much change at all and he should have done this last year when the first video surfaced. I think this is why some people are quick to jump on Rob, because he HAD the opportunity to deal with it earlier. That's one year wasted. People (myself included) are just skeptical that this is a sincere effort and not just more pr spin.  I've known a number of alcoholics in my life (one a relative) and their stories weren't the ones with happy endings so I understand the Herculean struggle that Ford now trods.  Regardless, this is a very sad story that I hope doesn't end in an obit."

851898,landry,2014-05-04 15:53:00,1005,He is a clearly not a nice man and there are lots of stories going back to high school apparently.  My grandpa was a nice man. He came back from WW2 an alcoholic and was not so nice for a period of time. He battled and rebounded and returned to being himself.  Being an alcoholic or drug attic does not make one a bad person but some bad people become alcoholics. I think Rob Ford is in the latter group.

He cut library funding, he cut daycare funding, he cut XXXX....all of these services are what makes a society function in a manner that is most efficient and enjoyable to its residences.  Sure he may have cut more from the budget than other Mayors, but what effect will that have on the city in the long run.  For example, he closed down a firestation and four fire trucks, saving the city taxpayers an average of $0.02 per day (or about $1 million a year), but what will that do the homes that that station serviced...it may not be felt today, but maybe it will be realized the next.  Saving money is not what a Mayor should have as his top priority.  It seems like that is his go to phrase and many are gobbling it up."

He believes he is above everyone else and uses the word sorry way too often.  He keeps claiming that he isn't perfect but that's no excuse for his behaviour. Not being perfect should not be a free pass to be racist, homophobic, flip off your employer, swear in front children, pee in public, etc..., - even more so as the Mayor of Toronto  He should own up, and preserve what little respect he may have left and just quit.   Period. And if he doesn't quit, let's hope Toronto has the sense to make it happen for him.  Here are some of the 42 items that are in a list of Ford's most memorable moments.  11. November 2012: Paying TTC passengers are told to get off a bus in the rain so it can pick up Fords football team after an away game and drive them back to Don Bosco. After the police request the bus, Ford calls the TTCs chief executive officer on his cellphone, then calls him again when the bus does not arrive immediately.  September 2012: City officials acknowledge that Ford personally asked senior civil servants to approve a road and drainage project on the land beside the headquarters of his familys business, Deco Labels and Tags, in time for the companys 50th anniversary party.  August 2010: The Toronto Sun confronts Ford about an arrest in Florida in 1999 for marijuana possession. Ford adamantly denies the charge: Im dead serious. When I say no, I mean never. No question, Now Im getting offended. No means no. He later acknowledges that he had one joint in my back pocket. The next day, he says his memory had been fuzzy because he had been charged with failing to give a breath sample that same night. But even that is not true: he was actually charged with driving under the influence, to which he pleaded no contest.  38. June 2006: During a debate on HIV/AIDS prevention spending, Ford says, according to a National Post transcript, Why are we catering to one group with a disease that's preventable? It's very preventable. If you're not doing needles and you're not gay, you won't get AIDS probably. And I don't know why we're spending $1.5-million on this.    39. April 2006: Ford berates a couple at a Maple Leafs game with such comments as Do you want your little wife to go over to Iran and get raped and shot? When the couple complains, Ford denies even being at the game  though he had given them his business card. He eventually concedes and apologizes, saying he had been pretty well acting like an idiot.  40. July 2005: Ford calls Councillor Gloria Lindsay Luby, a fellow Etobicoke conservative, a waste of skin."

851770,glen,2014-05-03 19:16:00,2641,It's the cracks fault.
851778,davey buoy,2014-05-03 19:29:00,5505,"Seeing as how I don't live in Toronto, or the suburbs of Toronto, I have no opinion on the merits he has produced as mayor of the GTA...  Myself like most of those replying to this post do not reside within his jurisdiction and as such have no real right to comment about his performance as mayor.  Like or dislike the man, you are not affected by his tenure as mayor as you are not living where he governs.  Armchair politics and slander, from outsiders reading their daily rag.  All men have problems, it takes a real man to own up to them. As I believe Mr. Ford is in the process of doing... Everyone's rock bottom is different. Nice to see our membership kicking a man while on his knees.  I don't believe bashing a elected official with an admitted substances problem is conductive here.  I fully expect to take some flack from those that are perfect and do no wrong.  G I agree,I believe his addiction(s) were running his mouth.He had no control while in his past state IMO.It may be a way bigger problem then we all thought???Just sayin."
851799,woodenboater,2014-05-03 21:52:00,2277,"imo, dude is only stepping away to avoid having to deal with questions about the new video and the comments he made that were in the audio tape the sun posted. he ran the gamut but saying what he did about Stintz was pretty low. His slur against Italians was also beyond the pale. he's also going to have to talk about the report about the security guards and St. Paddys Day.  and if he thinks he can come clean in one, ONE, month, well I have a bridge Deco can buy. the addictions are a manifestation of deeper problems. deep enough that they will require ongoing help and jumping back into the piranha pool will just trigger the problems again."
851802,woodenboater,2014-05-03 21:56:00,2277,"His kids, wife & mother are the ones I feel sorry for.  I do as well but they (obviously not the kids)are part of the cycle of enablers who let it get to this point. He's surrounded by enablers and THAT is a major problem."
851812,Duckie,2014-05-03 22:48:00,305, you do realize the only reason he is going to rehab is because he is trying to get re elected and it looks good right?  this should not go far in anyone's books because he is only doing this now because of the ballot.  he got caught and he needs to try and get sympathy. its crap.  if he wasn't running again he wouldn't be in rehab.  he would just be doing the 'im sorry' angle he has done 10000x before..  luckily most people seem smart enough now to see right through the Bull.  he needs to resign.

851578,Terry,2014-05-02 22:20:00,14456,he is paying  his family has a very well off business and he is rich by my standards I don't think he even keeps the wage he gets as mayor ..  he will pay for his drug rehab
851582,manitoubass2,2014-05-02 22:25:00,11391,Stand up guy.
851583,irishfield,2014-05-02 22:25:00,26272,His brother Doug will pay the bill... just to continue looking like he has his brothers best interest in hand!  That said.. who cares as long as he gets his act together before he's re-elected in the Fall !
851585,Terry,2014-05-02 22:29:00,14456,and there is a very good chance he will be re-elected
851586,davey buoy,2014-05-02 22:30:00,5505,"I do some work in their plant from time to time,and they are always swamped for the last 5 years I've been going there.I'm very sure they are not hurting. Usually run 24/7."
851589,misfish,2014-05-02 22:31:00,29133,"Stand up guy.  Ya,when he,s sober.LOL   Ya Wayne,I always get a chuckle when his brother is always talking for him,but you dont hear from Rob his self. I think his brother is a duch.  That said   Ya,but yer living life,not killing yerself and family."
851590,dracokaos,2014-05-02 22:32:00,116,I think this was the straw that broke the camels back.....I think he's done as mayor....only problem is....who is the lesser of the evils??
851591,misfish,2014-05-02 22:35:00,29133,and there is a very good chance he will be re-elected  I dont see it happening.  He has pissed too many people off.

851632,fisher,2014-05-03 00:45:00,451,"Sad that anyone would even think that he would get re-elected, let alone actually voting for him.  Anyone who thinks he should be re-elected is setting a terrible example for our (your) kids.  That is basically saying it is okay to repeatedly lie, openly associate with drug dealers, lie again,  smoke crack, lie again, act like a buffoon (see his rants), lie again, have no respect to anyone (Flipping bird to another driver who caught him reading a paper while driving; whispering ""b**ch"" during a town hall that he hosted to a woman who presented opposing views; having enough to eat comment; and on and on) ....  Pathetic. And so sad. More so to those that still support him.  Brothers are so arrogant; believing they are above the law (even his sister is getting on that with her latest court appearance because she did not complete  the community service time that she was sentenced to for stealing toothbrushes). That whole family is the same.  Hope Toronto gets some sense and pushes him out.  All I know is that the voter turnout may set some records given how polarizing he is. Should be interesting and something the late night shows will have a field day with for some time to come."
851637,NANUK,2014-05-03 01:15:00,797,"I think he is just gone on a little vacation, he'll be back shortly."
851638,BowSlayer101,2014-05-03 01:25:00,296,"he screwed up ALOT and i highly doubt he will be re-elected for the choices he has made in the past, however, he has done waaay more for the city than any other mayor so.....he's got problems for sure but he did do good fore the city."
851648,Duckie,2014-05-03 02:52:00,305,"but what about all the sexist, racist, homophobic stuff he rants about? there is NO rehab for  being a jerk"
851653,dhickey,2014-05-03 03:20:00,1038,I hate politics ... He screwed up BIG TIME...  Forget him and move on.
