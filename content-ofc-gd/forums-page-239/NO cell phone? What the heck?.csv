852287,jedimaster,2014-05-06 17:17:00,3472,"Its nice to have a phone for the functions that we stopped using other things for. Stopped carrying a handheld GPS while hunting, Use navionics, No GPS in the car, Use my cell phone for pictures unless I bring my dSLR, don't wear a watch or carry a flashlight, was the source of music in the car as I hate the radio. a Cell phone has replaced a lot of other everyday items for me. I have no problem unplugging but those are a few of the things I missed while not having a cell phone. Contacting people or social media aren't really major priorities of mine. If you aren't already in my presence I probably don't want to hear from you. haha"

852463,NAW,2014-05-07 16:01:00,4022,"I'm glued to my phone all the time.  But the one thing that I have really noticed in the past few years..  Is my night vision is not what it used to be...  Not so much because of the constant staring at the phone, and the small text...  But because I ALWAYS have a flashlight now...  I used to walk around my house in the pitch black dark, and be able to see my way through..  But now I just turn my phone on, and it lights everything up.  I'm literally lost with out my phone now!!"

851701,jedimaster,2014-05-03 14:32:00,3472,"So I quit my job a while ago and took a week off in between. I had to give up my cell phone on my last day and don't get my new one til Monday. Some interesting things happened. 1) I drove from Toronto to a small town south of grand bend without getting lost with no gps only an old school map and directions. 2) When I got there they weren't home so I walked around and someone offered me there phone and a beer while I waited. 3) Its hard to sell stuff when people can't call you or text you. lol 4) It's really hard to meet up with indecisive people using only email, my gf I think is pissed at me. I read her email as she has lots to do see you next week. I said have a good weekend, she emailed me back saying now I am sad. what the hell. of course I said sorry, we will see how that goes.  I think I am gonna go fishing. They don't seem to care I have no contact with humans P.S. caught a great limit of crappie over the last few days from an oldschool sportspal and a 1960's 3hp motor that ran out of gas about 3 km's from the launch location. yah a nice paddle into the wind and rain yesterday.... We were tempted to rope the crappie and use them like dog sled dogs. 60 crappie powered canoe.... yeeehaaa  just my random rant of the day...  I MISS MY PHONE!!!!"

Its very odd to try and live a normal life without any contact to the world. lol I think I am starting to enjoy no cell phone though. outside of everyone that's mad at me for not getting in touch with them. rofl"

851723,Big Cliff,2014-05-03 16:22:00,6899,"Isn't it funny how fast we have become attached to and dependant on technology. I honestly remember the old crank phones when I was a kid! ""hi Helen, ring Doris for me please"". The first diesel engine came into our town when I was 6, everyone was there at the station to see it. Typwriters, Telex, carbon paper, fountain pens.....How did we learn so much so fast? My little I phone has more power and memory that some of our office computers had and this thing fits in my pocket. I can only wonder what the future holds for my kids and grandkids."

851740,jedimaster,2014-05-03 17:17:00,3472,Just broke down and bought a home phone. I was already paying for the service for 3 months came free as part of my package. So weird I had to phone someone to find out my number.  I wonder if it has voicemail. haha. And a pencil I still have those. They are what I use to tighten up my cassettes.
851744,lew,2014-05-03 17:24:00,12766,I still remember in school when we graduated from pencils to nib pens with an ink well in the corner of the desk.  We were in the big times then

852109,Governator,2014-05-05 16:09:00,879,"I disconnected myself from my phone for nearly 3 months last year between Aug - Oct when my phone battery completely died.  After a weekend away with a dead phone I realized I loved being without it, I purposely decided not to buy a $10 battery to fix it and instead embrace what I couldn't use and enjoy my family time.  It had been years since I felt that in touch with my family & enjoyed myself when ""work ended"".  I also realized no client actually expects an immediate response after work hours from an email or text message and they generally are never offended if you don't reply right away.  The problem I had was I tried calling Rogers to have them end of my contract and save me about $60/month.  I signed that darn 3 year contract just before they put in the 2 year law and I wasn't willing to pay to get out of it.  They wouldn't cut me a break even after seeing I never used the phone for 3 months and thus I felt forced to have to keep using it until the contract ends.  So I got the battery fixed and back to addiction mode."
