He wants me to fish for walleye on westerly lake. Was curious if anyone had some info they cared to share with me. Pm if you choose. I can't find much info on this lake, it appears that it is relatively shallow, first hand knowledge would be greatly appreciated as well as some technique suggestions. My pal doesn't fish much and isn't much help for me. But he is one heck of a marksman. Cheers MM"
