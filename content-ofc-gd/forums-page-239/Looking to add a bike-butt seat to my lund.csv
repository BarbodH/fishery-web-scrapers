844388,bawbag,2014-03-30 11:48:00,48,Has anyone added one to their lund? Any recommendations for posts or seats? Don't want to spend the extra money for one that says lund on it.  
844392,John Bacon,2014-03-30 12:42:00,3277,I think Swivl-Eze makes a lot of the pedestals used be the boat companies.  You may be able to get the same product for less if you buy that brand.
844398,moxie,2014-03-30 13:38:00,1566,If there is already a post socket buy the same brand at the height you need whether fixed or adjustable.  As far as the actual seat? They come in various colours. I purchased one a few years ago for 20 something dollars and it still serves its purpose. Call local marinas inquire if they carry what is specific to your needs and if they don't they might be able to direct you to somone that does.
844433,BillM,2014-03-30 17:21:00,17367,I use a Swivel-Ez adjustable post + seat from BPS in our 1700 Pro Sport..  No complaints...  Only thing I would do is get one with a swivel for the seat mount so you can lean against the seat instead of having to sit on it.
844451,captpierre,2014-03-30 19:13:00,2521,I have a Lund and have been thinking of doing the same.  BPS has an adjustable post for about $120 and they also sell a seat for about $35 I think.  Not sure what same would cost from the Lund dealer.  Let me know if you find out.  Can likely get  on line too
844472,Dan668,2014-03-30 20:41:00,1120,My Lund bike seat was 150 with a post.
844480,BillM,2014-03-30 21:12:00,17367,"No need to get it through Lund, do you guys buy your tires from the GM/Ford dealers?   As long as it's a notcedh 2 3/8 post, it will fit fine..  I just updated both our front seats from fix posted to air ride, can't wait to test them in on Lake O in a few weeks."
844485,Garnet,2014-03-30 21:27:00,2056,The hydraulic ones get tired after use. Bought BPS pole with manual adjustments and will never go back.
845048,bawbag,2014-04-02 11:03:00,48,"Thanks for the replies guys. After searching all over online, it doesn't look like swivl-eze makes a tall enough seat post for the 2 3/8 bases that came installed in my Rebel. They do have power pedestal options that fit the other bases though. danbob your lund seat and post for 150 doesn't sound bad at all after looking at posts and seats online. Was that through a dealer? I will see what the prices will be like through my local dealers and keep you guys posted."
845050,Dan668,2014-04-02 11:35:00,1120,Yes it was through a dealer
845798,musky666,2014-04-05 15:28:00,126,"I wanted to do the same for my Starcraft- bought a swivl- ese power pole and bike seat at Bass Pro, took a spare base from my boat and test fit the size- it is a similar design but wont latch- fits snug enough I think and looking forward to using it this season."

I can't believe you cannot find a post that's not long enough.  I'm 6'3 and I've got an adjustable pedestal post upfront that I actually have to lower because it's too tall on it's highest setting."
845849,moxie,2014-04-05 19:15:00,1566,I also run Swivel-eze 238 series and ordered a matching post for $78+Tx. Used one of the bases from a seat I don't use and afixed it to the butt seat.
851856,bawbag,2014-05-04 07:51:00,48,"Bit of a late reply but I made it into the local dealer today, they want $180 just for the post and another $30 for a generic bike seat. Not going to happen... ill be ordering online and using a seat base off an extra one I have."

851869,Parnelly,2014-05-04 12:03:00,108,"Canadian Tire has posts, not sure if they carry the bike seat though. I think it was about 85 dollars for the bigger post. Cheaper for the smaller ones depending on size."
851871,Wolf 3,2014-05-04 12:30:00,134," Do you remember where you ordered your post from?  bawbag,  Where are you located?  Most marine supply stores will have these in stock or be able to get them for you. I purchased mine a few years back from  Port Whitby Marine Supply. http://www.weblocal.ca/port-whitby-marine-supplies-whitby-on.html  For 238 extension post reference, http://www.attwoodmarine.com/store/product/Bell-Pedestals-Fixed-Height  For  238 series seat mount reference, http://www.attwoodmarine.com/store/product/238-seat-mounts  When choosing a length for a fixed post, make sure you take into consideration the height of the seat base/mounts and the height (thickness of cushion) of the seat you choose to make sure the total height isn't too much.  Not sure of current pricing.  I remember paying around $100 for the fixed post and base combo and almost double for the adjustable."
851923,landry,2014-05-04 19:11:00,1005,"The swivel eze 238 comes in 27"" fixed. That is what I use. It is a good height for me at 5'8""."
