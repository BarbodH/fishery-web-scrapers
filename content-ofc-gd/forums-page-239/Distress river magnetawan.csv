851988,boddah,2014-05-05 00:13:00,61,Is anyone familiar with this area?? I can't find any info on what fish are in the distress river. It flows into the magnetawan river which I believe has bass pike and walleye. Any info is much appreciated!!

852355,bushart,2014-05-07 00:18:00,2628,What town is near?---maybe a guy could call a local tackle shop?  Sorry myself---never been there  MNR may be another bet---call district office---they'll know species---and regs

852372,mikemcmillan,2014-05-07 01:16:00,50,"I have a place on Lake Cecebe, which is part of the Magnetawan River,  the Distress flows into the lake east of Magnetawan, Like Nipfisher say it's good for walleye, I have seen them just under 10 pounds, some large pike and a lot of bass. Haven't  fished the river since I was a kid back in the 70's and we would catch a ton of catfish in there, plus it was fun to run up the river in the boat. Lots of fish but the walleye can be hard to find. It's a nice area to visit and a lot of lakes close by to explore. Many of the lakes have public launches as well. Mike"
