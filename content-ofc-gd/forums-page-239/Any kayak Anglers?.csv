851035,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-30 00:17:00,10439,don't do it what will you do with the extra 2 feet if she gives you the boot. lol   Art  Drive around with it on the roof of his car!!!!!
851036,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-30 00:18:00,10439,The lure is sweet I would have given it serious consideration if there was a dealer close to me... Very wide and high which is great for fishing but not so much for paddling against the wind and current. I now recommend that everyone makes sure they love the paddling part as much as the fishing. I had a 5k paddle on Sunday against the wind and definitely did not love it! I now realize the weather is only perfect 10-15% of the time and the paddling can be an unpleasant chore at times. Just sayin...  Paddling against tides sucks too.
851907,misfish,2014-05-04 17:08:00,29133,"Jeti  I stopped into MEC this morning to have a look at this one. Looks like it will do me fine.  http://www.mec.ca/product/5036-046/feelfree-lure-10-kayak/?No=40&h=10+50004+50015+50795&f=10+50004+50795  I really like the wheel feature at the keel for when dragging it to the water. Saves buying the cart,They are a bit on the heavy side,but the beam is 31 inches.. Slip proof standing ."
851912,jedimaster,2014-05-04 18:05:00,3472,"Looks cool, I found a canoe I am gonna use til I buy a boat in the summer. So the kayak dreams are over for me for now..."
851916,misfish,2014-05-04 18:15:00,29133,"Looks cool, I found a canoe I am gonna use til I buy a boat in the summer. So the kayak dreams are over for me for now...  Enjoy the canoe.  Just to add to this yak.  You cant see it clearly,but there,s room on that back handle and strong enough, to install an electric trolling motor.."

851919,misfish,2014-05-04 18:27:00,29133,Nice  I have this thing about sit ins.  Not comfortable with that feeling..
852004,super dave,2014-05-05 00:54:00,323,I just bought one this year in march and still waiting for my maiden voyage.  Jackson big tuna.  I got kids so the versatility is nice.   If any of you yakkers want to get together shoot me a message.
852068,Garnet,2014-05-05 10:38:00,2056,Don't Kayak............We did win one on the weekend............still not going to yak.
850729,jedimaster,2014-04-28 20:36:00,3472,Just wondering if there are any kayak anglers on here that want to get together for some crappie/perch maybe some trout on Lake O this week/weekend. I am probably going to be picking up the new kayak tonight.
850731,misfish,2014-04-28 20:39:00,29133,Im still looking for my first yak. I dont want to buy just any yak and think I should of bought something different. They look like a lot of fun to fish from.
850732,Shloim,2014-04-28 20:42:00,515,Hey You are on every site huh? I just got my tarpon 100 and have been out twice. Id love to go catch some fish but Im thinking Im not ready for Lake O. Is that where your going? and what yak are ya getting? Ive been paddling the holland river as its calm but no fish to speak of yet.  Id love to get out sometime and maybe learn a little especially from a Jedi
850737,jedimaster,2014-04-28 20:58:00,3472,"haha, I will be starting all over in the yak. I live on Lake O and there is a fairly sheltered bay that I will dip into first. I am looking at the Old Town Vapor Angler 12xt. Its on sale at Sail for 399 on the 1rst. The lady said I can just buy it now and bring the receipt in for a price adjustment. I am going to go look at it now."
850738,misfish,2014-04-28 21:01:00,29133,Would like to hear what you think. I seen that on sale as well.
850739,Dan668,2014-04-28 21:13:00,1120,Would like to hear what you think. I seen that on sale as well.  Was also interested. Seen it in an email from them
850741,jedimaster,2014-04-28 21:16:00,3472,Just not too sure if I will be able to get a 12 footer up the stairwell into my apt... a 10 footer should make it. A 12 is cutting it close.
850748,misfish,2014-04-28 21:28:00,29133,"Im not going with the ten ft. Bigger is better,,so Im told.LOL"
850752,jedimaster,2014-04-28 21:40:00,3472,Yah the more I look at it the more I don't think a 12 will fit. A real man can make due with a 10. Haha
850760,Shloim,2014-04-28 22:08:00,515,I bought the 10 footer so that it would fit iun the car easy etc. its awesome for loading and unloading. I looked for a vapor 10 here and no one had them only 12's. I saw the 10 at dicks in buffalo  it looks great and comes with a bunch of stuff too I believe.
850778,jedimaster,2014-04-28 22:57:00,3472,I am doubting that a 10 footer will make it up the  stairs now that I got home... Gonna have to get out the tape measure. They had a nice looking inflatable kayak that looked very well made covered in canvas type. I wonder what that thing is like?
850789,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-28 23:48:00,10439,Do you have a balcony? If you do haul it up with ropes!!!
850790,grizzlybri,2014-04-28 23:53:00,565,"I'll be out on my yak this weekend for the big derby in Quinte, but any other time just give me a week heads up because i keep mine at the cottage"
850794,jedimaster,2014-04-29 00:02:00,3472,If I had a balcony I would.... I just measured my windows... no dice.  haha
850795,Shloim,2014-04-29 00:04:00,515,I think you might just have to move...
850796,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-29 00:06:00,10439,^^^He's right!!! I see a move in your future!!!!
850837,cuzza,2014-04-29 11:43:00,467,"Jedi - I can't seem to post links but Google ""Point 65 Modular Fishing Kayak"" which is a little more apartment friendly, they also do non angler versions that might fit the bill for a few less bills"
850871,jedimaster,2014-04-29 13:31:00,3472,"Looks cool, will be checking reviews. I am always a bit leary of anything collapsable. Fishing rods, umbrellas, tent poles... they all seem to collapse when you don't want them to... haha"
850900,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-29 15:27:00,10439,Forgot about those. Check this one @ Dick's. If you buy the mid section as well you could use it in solo mode on smaller waters and bigger waters with the centre section installed.  http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=21094086
850906,misfish,2014-04-29 15:51:00,29133,"The one I really like is the Feel Free Lure 11.5. Cant post links or pics from work. It,s a bit pricey,but looks like it would suit my needs."
850907,jedimaster,2014-04-29 15:53:00,3472,The GF has offered her garage to me for the kayak... we will see.... maybe a 12 footer is in order.
850919,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-29 16:56:00,10439,"In that case look at this one: http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/product/index.jsp?productId=20973116&cp=4406646.4413993.4417832.4417969 It's actually built from the Wilderness Systems Tarpon 120 (2009 model year) form. And is 1/2 the price of the current Tarpon 120.  I picked one up last month while on vacation and it's a really nice yak. Here it's is on it's maiden voyage in Tampa Bay. It didn't take me long to customize it with rod holders, fish finder, milk crate and action cam.  "
