850210,wormdunker,2014-04-26 11:44:00,1711,Questions for Saltydawg & others  What should the strapping spacing be? Can you walk on the steel roof without damaging it? Should the old shingles be removed?  Might be a silly question - but is it absolutely necessary? What guage metal do you advise?  Very good info here.  Thanx
850211,mcdougy,2014-04-26 11:54:00,274,"I'm not trying to get into any fights with anyone......sheet metal, here's what I know. The growing trend in sheet metal is 29guage high tensile metal. It costs less and covers more(wider sheet).  I personally refuse to use it and continue to use the tried and tested 28guage. I used 29guage on a buddies small lean too off his garage. It is very brittle/ shatter prone IMO . You can not walk on the ribs or they will crack, when you cut it, it is messy as far as paint chipping and burning. All of this caused from being high tensile. I asked  about trees because if you had a lot near the roof I would be concerned if a branch came down on the roof. Again  it's a concern with 29 gauge IMO, with 28 regular steel no concern it just seems that much more forgiving as far as it will take more abuse.  Mennonite steel....... Here's what has evolved in this area.....they bought a roll former from one of the major steel sheet suppliers, fixed it up and got it ready for use. THEN they needed rolls of steel to put through their roller so they started buying the REJECTED coils from the major supplier. Both were happy, Mennonites took the rejected coils at a discounted price, and the supplier had a outlet for rejected coils.  These coils could be rejected for several reasons....bad primer, pin holing, bad paint bond are the most common. Well if you buy cheaper steel, have your own roll former, and lotsa kids to help you can sell steel at a discounted price obviously. Well for this reason Mennonite steel caught on with non educated or bottom line consumer, business was booming. Then the issues started showing up, but  there was no warranty. They effected the market largely, causing the major steel companies to start lowering there prices to get more competeive.  Both parties had a pow wow and  major suppliers said were not selling you steel any more at a discounted price here's what it's gonna cost you now. This caused the Mennonites to start sourcing to the u.s. And caused the prices to be much more in line with the majors. They had another pow wow and decided that they would all raise there prices 15% over the original long standing price. Blaa blatant blaa  to be honest I'm not sure what the story is now on what the Mennonites are up too besides they sold the company around here to a regular joe.  So I guess that's what I am heeding caution towards in my experience, I would recommend a 28 gauge high rib steel ( which costs about 10% more than 29 )  and something with literature on the paint warranty. The product that I use and who will deliver anywhere in ontario or further  has a 25 year paint warranty.  Their application sounds correct as far as strapping with 1x4 on 24"" max o.c., if noise is a concern you can apply sheets of foil faced board like energy board on top of strapping then screw the metal through it to strapping.  Make sure strapping is nailed to the rafters and not just the plywood. Blaa blaa blaa. Anymore questions just ask..."
850212,mcdougy,2014-04-26 12:00:00,274," You need some air flow and a flat surface to screw the metal to, leaving the old shingles on is pretty standard, considering there is not 3 layers on there already, raising a weight concern. Each metal has a recommended strapping spacing, in general 24"" max. I like 28 gauge but some consider this ""old school"" mainly because it costs more but that's because it's better metal IMO."
850214,Roy,2014-04-26 12:09:00,13728,"And once a best price is arrived at, ask for an out building to be thrown in as well. Like a boathouse or shed..."
850215,leaf4,2014-04-26 12:10:00,2466,"I work in sheet metal and prior to you posting 28/29 ga. I was assuming 26 would be the metal used, I do agree with you that 29 ga is garbage, some suppliers make 30 gauge pipe and it's like tin foil, good info here for myself in the future though!"
850216,mcdougy,2014-04-26 12:23:00,274,"Cliff, you may want to reconsider putting snow jack on the entire roof, yes it stops the snow from sliding, thuss it makes the snow stay on your roof, thus not letting your roof clear can add a lot of weight, given your location. Sometimes i think over the doorways and where you park your car car is sufficient."
850217,Big Cliff,2014-04-26 12:36:00,6899,"Super information, thank you so much!  Just got off the phone, 40 year paint warranty in writing from the manufacturer however it is only 29 gauge. I did ask about 28 gauge and he said he has been using this for about 12 years now without any issues. He did say he could get and use 28 gauge but it is more expensive and he didn't think it was necessary but would quote us on that if we wanted.  I will ask for a quote on the 28 gauge.  Again, thank you so much for helping to educate me on what is good and why and what questions to ask."

850219,mcdougy,2014-04-26 12:53:00,274,"No problem, I have not heard of a 40 year warranty i would read the fine print there for sure. If interested I use VicWest metal, genarally in the supervic profife for roofs. Vicwest is probablly the largest company in canada when it comes to sheet type metal. See how there paint warranty wording compares to this products out of curousity, Im positive your installer will be aware of the VW products also. They have been around for a loooongtime."
850223,mcdougy,2014-04-26 13:01:00,274,"Also Cliff since you have some valleys, I would ask about a ""W"" valley versus the normal ""V"" valley. It helps slow the water from washing through the valley and up under the opposing metal.  Metal roofs are trickier to seal for alot of reasons..some previously mentioned. In general ask ""How do you seal the valleys? In general a tar impregnated foam tape is used vs caulking and the like."
850225,Big Cliff,2014-04-26 13:13:00,6899,"Will do! Should have posted on this sooner so I could have had a whole list of questions to ask. Anyone else thinking of going steel roof, here is a good place to get started!"
850227,mcdougy,2014-04-26 13:23:00,274,Theres never a dumb question only dumb answers....  Any self respecting contractor will spend the time to answer all concerns....especially if hes getting paid by the hour!!!!

850797,Steve,2014-04-29 00:18:00,2075,I'm in Hamilton and will be buying a new roof and shingles/or whatever.  I have saved up the money.  Anyone have a reputable rec here in Hamilton?
851867,cowanjo,2014-05-04 11:54:00,249,Interested in the outcome Cliff how did it all go
851902,Big Cliff,2014-05-04 16:12:00,6899,"Well, after considering all the information I received here and talking to Jason @ Elite roofing and several of his customers we decided to go with him on the 29 gauge. I would have prefered the 28 gauge because of what was recommended here but it was going to be about $800.00 more. I realize that there is a concern if someone was to walk on our roof and step on ribs or if there were large branches that could land on it but there is no reason for anyone to be up on our roof and no large trees nearby.  I also talked to several people reguarding the product that he was using and not one of them had anything negitive to say about the quality of the product and I couldn't find anyone that had ever had a warrenty claim (hope I'm not going to be the first LOL).  Jason was very well organized and very professional, he and his crew showed up and went to work, they had a bit of a delay because of high winds and rain but as of Friday night they had it all done. I was really pleased with the time they took installing trim and drip guards etc.. They really seemed to care about what they were doing. The other thing that impressed me was that everyone else I talked to wanted money up front, Jason didn't want a cent until all the work was compleated to my satisfaction. I asked him why and he told me he had never had any problems getting paid for a job because he always made sure that the customer knew what they were getting and he made sure things were done properly.  The most important thing is that Sue is happy, I have a new roof that should last for a very long time, and I got it for a very reasonable price compared to other quotes."
851908,lew,2014-05-04 17:08:00,12766,"Jason didn't want a cent until all the work was compleated to my satisfaction.  Good to hear everything worked out for you Cliff and it sounds like you found a great guy to do the work.  One thing I've noticed alot since moving to the country is the different attitude of the contractors compared to the ones in the city. I had a skylight installed 3 weeks ago and they didn't want any type of down payment either and other than a call from the boss on completion of the job to be sure I was completely satisfied, I've never even received a bill from them yet."
851915,Big Cliff,2014-05-04 18:10:00,6899,"Funny how that works isn't it Lew; I always worry when a guy doesn't want to give me a written quote (got burned on that once) or wants 50% (or more) up front. Word of mouth is so important to any business especially in an area like this!  Glad to hear your job worked out too! If I ever need a skylight installed, I know who to call!"
852003,ketchenany,2014-05-05 00:51:00,3229,"Cliff, this gentleman has a good business plan, keep your clients happy and they will come back and refer more. I have a cousin who does Reno work and new projects, he built his business on references, hard to do, but honesty is the best way to go.  met an honest small engine repair person just like you on the weekend  good advice and the price was right."
852060,mcdougy,2014-05-05 05:59:00,274,"I'm glad it all worked out for you Cliff. Being the fifth generation licensed carpenter in our family business  I can attest to clients surprise when they find out no money ""up front"" is required. Workmanship and professionalism speak for themselves. TRUST is what I appreciate  most, I'm doing work on someone's home and understand it is their investment of finance and pleasure. They do not want someone messing with that. The gratifying part is when the job is done,  how happy and most often life changing you have just made your new friend. Just like I'm hearing you speak of your contractor. There are many of us that DO know what we are doing and saying. Our business is purely referral work as well, we are not in the phone book/ internet at all. It makes it nice when you can also ask someone about a potentional customer via referral. Working for strangers is a bit nerve racking for my financial interests also, so it's nice when we all know someone in common. But if we all trust each other and stand by our words, it has always worked out. We have never been burned thankfully, nor had a dissatisfied client."
852071,Big Cliff,2014-05-05 11:22:00,6899,"And that my friend is what it is all about!  Again, I want to thank you so much for taking the time to help me make an informed decision! When I had my business going I always said that I never wanted to be embarrised in meeting one of my customers out in public or at a party. I am not going to say that I was perfect but I always tried my best! Perhaps that was the secret to our success."
850084,Big Cliff,2014-04-25 20:40:00,6899,"Well, it is getting to that time, our roof is 12 years old (so much for 25 year shingles LOL). It doesn't leak yet and I am told that they MIGHT be ok for a couple of more years but the last thing I need in my life is to wake up in the middle of the night in a rain storm and find water coming into my house.  I got a couple of quotes; 57 bundles of shingles (50 + caps and starters), strip the old stuff off, two rows ice and water shield, tar paper the rest, new gutters (2) $4600.00 all in.  Then I got a quote from a local guy (good reputation) to do it in steel. Snow guards and all $5200.00 and he (swares and guarentees) that it will never leak and will last many times longer than shingles. I wanted black, (our house is grey) Sue wantes charcoal grey (she is afraid black will fade over time)  Anyone else got any thoughts on this?   "
850086,2 tone z71,2014-04-25 20:47:00,1311,Steel all the way ..never worry about it again ..we do many roofs a yr ..some prefer the heavier laminate shingles..steels quick fast durable

I'd pick charcoal over black. Black will fade for sure......great for melting snow off though! My old place was red....never faded either.....and never held snow. Only put the snow stops over your door ways....or anything else that might need protected. Let the snow slide off. A charcoal coloured steel roof will melt off even on a real cold day.    S."
850089,irishfield,2014-04-25 20:59:00,26272,Yep... I've got 19 years on my Steel Tile roof (simulated clay tile) come October and other than needing to get up and tighten a few screws up this summer I'd never do shingles again (especially on a 12/12 pitch.. why I did steel in the first place!). It's gonna outlive me... even if I make it to 90!
850096,misfish,2014-04-25 21:21:00,29133," Not if you keep picking yer nose with those rods.LOL  Cliff,I,ll send you a PM in the morning about our steel roofing company. We have a sister plant that stamps and installs. So there,s no middle man.  I remember when they started and I was stamping out the panels.  The owner is the same man/family, that I work for today.  http://www.allsteelroofing.ca/"
850097,Bernie,2014-04-25 21:25:00,3190,Sick and tired of shingles. They don't last and getting rid of the old ones is a pain in the behind. Going steel at my cottage this summer.
850111,Fishwilly,2014-04-25 22:11:00,206,Big Cliff  I'm a general contractor and I'd suggest you go with the steel roof. Black or charcoal up to you. Woulnd't go with shingles as they only lasted 12yrs. That being said 12 yrs is pretty low for 25 yrs shingles. I'm thinking you might need better venting or insulation. Make sure they use the Maxxi vents and that your soffits have sufficient air flow. Lastly make sure you have styro vents in the attic at the wall transition to let air circulate and escape at the peak. I've seen plenty of older homes where the siding crews would install perforated soffits right over the old plywood soffits.
850127,bushart,2014-04-25 23:04:00,2628,I've seen many Black metal roofs after some years---wouldn't be my 1st choice for colour
850132,dracokaos,2014-04-25 23:16:00,116,"I have steel at the cottage, awesome roof. The only thing I would have done differently was insulate the roof before install. Not to keep it warmer but in a rain storm what a racket it makes lol....I don't know whats worse, the constant slow dripping after a rain as it drips from the trees, or the roar of a waterfall during a good storm...  But in the end steel all the way, almost %100 worry free"
850135,wormdunker,2014-04-25 23:33:00,1711,"Cliff - Where did you buy the 25 year shingles that only lasted 12 years?  I had a similar situation with Home Depot.

850140,Maverick,2014-04-25 23:46:00,371,"That price for steel, no brainer. As some have said here, the black steel does fade, a nice charcoal would look really good though."
850145,NAW,2014-04-25 23:57:00,4022,I need a few quotes for my roof as well.  I'm 95% sure it will steel.  But I also thin my roof will be more like 15 to 20 grand....
850149,mcdougy,2014-04-26 00:09:00,274,"Big Cliff, I have a few questions for you that will help me give you my professional opinion.  As there are a few things that can make a steel quote very different.....Whats your pitch? Do you have many valleys? What preperation were they doing to existing roof before applying steel? Was it a sheet type metal or individual tiles? Whos metal was it? What guage metal was it? was there any mention of paint warranty?  Do you have many trees close to your house? Did they discuss what types of flashings and vents they were putting on the metal roof? what material were they going to strap with? How close  o/c is the strapping? Not trying to hinder only help,  but there are many things to consider besides the bottom line."
850150,woodenboater,2014-04-26 00:13:00,2277,I'd go with steel as well and am thinking I'll need to do our home in the next little while. Question I have is can they install steel on gambrel style roofs or does it it need straight run ?
850153,mcdougy,2014-04-26 00:20:00,274,"I'd go with steel as well and am thinking I'll need to do our home in the next little while. Question I have is can they install steel on gambrel style roofs or does it it need straight run ? Steel can go on anything, anywhere really...your roof style would not be a problem.  The biggest thing to consider as a installer is... the water runs so darn fast on a steel roof...valleys are  tougher to seal due to how fast the water can run. I will pass on some roofs that are not suitable for steel IMO mostly the ones with 25' valleys on a 12/12 pitch.   If you went with RED and put a yellow M on the side yoou could sell 4 billion hamburgers tooo.  I only deal with sheet type metals, the""shingle type "" metal I have stayed away from, only a personal choice. There are alot of different ""shingle types"" out there."
850159,dhickey,2014-04-26 00:56:00,1038,Steel without a doubt.  Like any thing ells there are details you should be aware of.  And venting is extremely important because it helps stop the freeze thaw cycle  inherent to steel roofs and that's what does damage. You should also make sure that when the snow slides off it doesn't hit your eavestrough  and do damage to it. Another thing I would strongly recommend is cover the entire roof with ice and water shield on top of your substrate (plywood or God forbid aponite} because metal moves with temperature changes (winter/summer) as well as the freeze thaw cycle during fall winter and spring and don't forget the wood framing structure supporting your roof.(it moves independent of the steel.) Thus the  ice and water shield creates a flexible waterproof seal between the steel and wood over your entire roof not just the first 3 feet above your eavestrough. (VERY IMPORTANT) If you can post a picture of your roof and that would give us a better idea of material cost(aprox) labour and time is easy to figure out.  Its hard to judge a price without seeing the roof but on average it seems a little on the low side for a roof that will never leak?  Don.
850169,captpierre,2014-04-26 01:26:00,2521,I gotta say I've seen some pretty ugly steel roofs.  I'm sure steel will last longer but  I like the look of asphalt shingles.  Should last 20+ yrs.
850171,Gerritt,2014-04-26 01:31:00,6129,I would go one step further Don and suggest blue skin so I would never have to worry about it again.
850176,bigugli,2014-04-26 01:51:00,6138,"I've put up a few steel roofs on farm houses and barns some 20 odd years back. Many are still looking like new, and the one at my buddy's farm still don't leak. It's been a long time since I've seen a shingled roof last as long as a manufacturer claims."
850195,Old Ironmaker,2014-04-26 04:56:00,8243,"Cliff, 12 years on shingles is very poor performance. As suggested there is something going on here that isn't kosher. I re shingled 2 years ago. All the quotes for steel came in at least 30% higher than shingles. There were a few reasons we didn't go with steel, primarily the only steel my wife wanted was more than double the price. If my wife doesn't want something it ain't getin done. Plus we have a cathedral ceiling and sound could be an issue. We stayed at a friends place and slept upstairs and it rained and not hard and we never slept due to the definite sound. I have to add it was a low pitched roof that might add to the sound factor as there would be less space between the ceiling and roof sheathing.  Steel is a no brainer at that price but be sure to ask for a few numbers and addresses of customers they have done work for and call them for feedback. Call before the guy leaves. Drive by to look for yourself, you wouldn't believe how many contractors give you testimonials from family members that never had work done. Tough to do when we are talking a steel roof, easy to talk about a kitchen reno when you never get to see the kitchen.  I am very cynical aren't I. It's saved me money over the years."
850197,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-26 05:05:00,10439,"Planning on a steel roof on my cabin. Not only for looks and longevity but for fire resistance, being nowhere near fire fighting services."

Not trying to hinder only help,  but there are many things to consider besides the bottom line. I don't know what the pitch is, it isn't very steep but it isn't what would be classed as a low pitch roof I don't think. If I had to guess I would say it probably drops about 1' in 3'. There are 2 valleys no chimney 2 roof vents for plumbing. They said something about cutting shingles back from the edges a couple of inches all around the edges to allow for trim apart from that strapping the existing roof. It will be sheet but I didn't ask what gauge it would be, they are getting it from the local Menonites ""Stoll Metal Products"" which seems to be the supplier of choice around these parts. I haven't asked about what material the strapping would be but it is 1 X 4, didn't ask about spacing, I guess I just figured they knew what they were doing.  No big trees close to the house but I do have a row of cedar trees running along one side of the house that go about 15' above my roof line.  Flashings and vents. Ridge vents, snow guards on all slopes, not just over the doors, drip moldings and trim (caps) on all outside edges. The comapny we got the quote from is Elite Roofing Systems in Bobcaygeon his name is Jayson Doucet. Seemed very professional, and sat down with us and answered any questions we had and no pressure what ever.  I didn't think to ask about paint warrenty, Stoll have been around these parts for quite a few years and seem to have a good reputation. He did say that any color would fade to some degree given enough time and that is why we chose charcoal grey rather than black.  Hope this is enough to help.  Cliff"
