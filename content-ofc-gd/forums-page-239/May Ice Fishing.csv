851804,Basskicker,2014-05-03 22:04:00,421,"Yesterday we went and removed the hut and fished for an hour or so.  Just crazy to be still ice fishing in May!!! Still 2 feet of snow in the bush and 20-28"" inches of ice on the three different lakes we checked.  The rivers finally decided to let go about 2 days ago……opener is still in question?                "
851806,misfish,2014-05-03 22:13:00,29133,"WOW Terry and I started early,and you guys are still going later.  Unreal season.  Nice going."
851807,chris.brock,2014-05-03 22:19:00,4053,"crazy winter for sure, great job whoever built that hut  I don't care myself, but is that nearest rod holder device up to code?"
851808,irishfield,2014-05-03 22:27:00,26272,Uses a release clip just like down rigging Chris.. legal as it can be.  Great stuff J.. well if it was March! lol
851813,solopaddler,2014-05-03 22:51:00,8605,Man you have a lot of toys! When did you get the Argo with the tracks? (think that's what it is?)  Is there any outdoor related gadget/gizmo/transportation device you don't  own? LOL!
851816,Terry,2014-05-03 23:05:00,14456,very cool...for May..lol  and the rod holder only loads up the rod and  no other spring device so it is 100% legal
851817,Basskicker,2014-05-03 23:07:00,421,Man you have a lot of toys! When did you get the Argo with the tracks? (think that's what it is?)  Is there any outdoor related gadget/gizmo/transportation device you don't  own? LOL! Ha..ha...too funny Mike!!  Yes Mike I do have a lot of toys....but the argo and hut is not mine.  It belongs to another gentlemen in town here whom I'm privileged to fish with.  My hut is  A LOT bigger...lol
851824,Rizzo,2014-05-04 00:41:00,4754,"Like that rod holder! Can't believe the ice, what a brutal year"
851829,dhickey,2014-05-04 00:53:00,1038,Your so lucky. Just today I finally came to grips with the end of winter and put my gear away. Then you post your report..Arrg  Nice pike
851837,NAW,2014-05-04 02:16:00,4022,"I wish I could have made it out in may!  Things broke up in my lakes a few weeks back.  Ya.  Crazy rod holder.  I though they where illegal as well.  Does it not set the hook for you?  I always though ""spring loaded"" rod holders, or anything that sets a hook for you, was illegal?"
851845,Freshtrax,2014-05-04 03:08:00,2215,That would make down riggers illegal.
851849,Basskicker,2014-05-04 03:49:00,421,"Believe it or not, but the elder gentlemen that I was with has ice fished the 1st week of June.....now that's crazy!!!    Last year we removed my much larger hut on May 8 with snowmobiles....and there was still 2 feet of ice and lots of snow.  Global warming.....hmmm.....  The rod in question is called a Jaw Jacker for anyone that is interested.....they are awesome!!! They are completely sold out in North America for this year due to their high demand.....I actually tracked down the owner in the states on Facebook and called him at home.....great guy. He managed to track down 4 for me from a small mom/pop shop in ohio who them shipped them to me!!!!"

I always though ""spring loaded"" rod holders, or anything that sets a hook for you, was illegal? the rod does not count as a spring every time you set the hook normally you load up the rod which is a spring action that sets the hook...and so the spring devise has to be other then the rod to be illegal"
851865,wormdunker,2014-05-04 11:17:00,1711,That's awesome - Ice fishing in May - & fish on the ice !  That hut looks pretty nice too.  A little bigger it could be my house!
851884,moxie,2014-05-04 14:02:00,1566,Are you kidding me?!?!?!?!?! I'm afraid I'm gonna have to report this post and demand it be deleted. Ice fishing in May?!?!?! LET IT STOP!!!!!!!  Good stuff just the same.
