Looking to take a trip up that way in July and was hoping for some more info about the park and fishing.  Cheers,"
786335,chris.brock,2013-05-13 21:52:00,4053,I'd say drive the 40 min further up 144 and try Halfway PP and the lakes around there
786349,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-05-13 23:08:00,310,"My aunt has a cottage on that lake (for nearly 30 years now). No pike in there, although my cousin caught one 20 years ago. There is walleye, smallies, lakers, perch and whitefish in that lake. There are even rumours of brookies..."
786364,Stoty,2013-05-14 00:50:00,2910,"I just went on the Fish-online site by the gov't and it says Walleye, Smallies, Perch Lakers and Brook trout. They stocked the lake in 2009 and 2011 with Bookies.  How is the fishing there typically? I'd be looking for Bass/Walleye."
786441,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-05-14 03:14:00,310,"Bass fishing is pretty good, my cousin caught an eight pound smallie in there once. Walleye fishing is a little tougher but there are giants in there. It's a big lake with big fish but it can be hit and miss... And it ain't called Windy lake for nothing."
850392,35Wailin,2014-04-27 01:27:00,59,"I camp there quite often.  I like the park.  The only fishing I've done there so far is from my canoe.  I've also only caught Smallmouth and one Whitefish.  I was not successful with Lakers last spring, nor have I seen any Pike or Walleye.  This year, I am bringing my boat for the May long weekend, so I should be able to explore more places."

852547,35Wailin,2014-05-07 23:46:00,59,"I`ve been to Halfway a few times over the years.  Never fished there, but the skeeters were atrocious!!!  Beach was dirty as well, the one time I went swimming."
852597,Stoty,2014-05-08 05:57:00,2910,"Thanks for the replies. I've already book at Windy, so that's where I'll be headed. As long as there's smallies in the lake.. I'm good to go.  Thanks again for the info gents."
