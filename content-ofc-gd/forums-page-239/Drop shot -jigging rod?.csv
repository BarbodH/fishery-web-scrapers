852290,shimano19,2014-05-06 17:23:00,196,Is it possible to get a rod that can be used for drop shotting and also be useful for jigging a jig and minnow? Id like to get one rod action that can perform well while fishing those 2 methods. Or do they need two totally different actions. Thanks!
852292,EC1,2014-05-06 17:34:00,930,"Yes, tons of people have bought into one rod for one technique. But after collecting rods for a few years, I noticed that most rods are much more versatile than advertised. And most importantly, spend a day trying the rod. You might be pleasantly surprised"
852295,lookinforwalleye,2014-05-06 17:45:00,4399,I say yes most definitely but the talking billboards on TV would rather you buy 3 rods for each application!!!  How did we ever survive all those years with 1 or 2 rods....trolled with em...casted with em...jigged with em etc etc.!!!
852297,BillM,2014-05-06 18:05:00,17367,"I like something in the 7-75ft range, F or XF tip..   You can use a rod like that for all kinds of different techniques."
852298,musky_hunter,2014-05-06 18:15:00,328,What's the budget?
852309,shimano19,2014-05-06 20:16:00,196,"well I'm thinking around $150. Right now For spinning setups I have a avid and premier both medium, fast action. Would that be a good rod for both applications?"
852310,Lunatic,2014-05-06 20:23:00,536,"i have a shimano crucial frog rod,its a 7' med/heavy with extra fast tip, there isnt much difference between that and the jig rod i think. i use it for frogs/spinners/crank baits........."
852338,Joeytier,2014-05-06 22:33:00,3990,"I have 7'6"" st. Croix wild river that I use for those techniques specifically, and its perfect.  You'll want to get something with more flex throughout the rod imo, especially with live bait fishing"
852342,jbailey,2014-05-06 22:49:00,866,check out the st.croix eyecon
852360,porkpie,2014-05-07 00:51:00,2521,"St. croix eyecon 7'6"" extra fast.  You'll love it!! I do!  About $105-120 depending where you shop!"
852367,Maverick,2014-05-07 01:04:00,371,"For a dropshot I like a little more bend. I use a 7'6"" ML with an extra fast tip. I also jig for walleye with the same rod. I've even hauled up 10 lb+ catfish with it."
852369,musky_hunter,2014-05-07 01:06:00,328,The daiwa tatula 7' medium would be a good selection at that price.
852376,Henricus,2014-05-07 01:37:00,118,"To answer your question, as long as they are within a few inches of 7' in length, they should do just fine."
852404,Stoty,2014-05-07 06:17:00,2910,"I dropshot A LOT.... and I'd have to say that even though you can use a 7ft med for almost anything...(I've found) using the same rod for both dropshot & jigging wouldn't be ideal. I prefer a much lighter action rod for dropshotting than I would use with jigging.  I run two high end dropshot rods, both are just over 7ft and both are ML. I find ML to be a little too light for jigging...but that's just my personal preference."
