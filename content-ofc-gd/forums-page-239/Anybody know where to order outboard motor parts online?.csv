851925,chris.brock,2014-05-04 19:19:00,4053,I need a water pump kit for an old 9.9 Evinrude  thanks
851928,Sinker,2014-05-04 19:30:00,8692,PM bernie. He will know where to get them.  S.
851949,Weeds,2014-05-04 20:23:00,782,"I ordered one yesterday , for a 98 evinrude 9.9, it was 53 dollars from Gateway motor sports in peterborough, (I think that's what it's called) they should have it Tuesday. I'd thought about ordering one online but once you factored in shipping  and wait times I didn't really see any advantages. I need one for an old 6 hp Johnson too, let me know if you find a good place."
851986,Tim Mills,2014-05-04 23:57:00,476," I'm assuming the guy didn't stiff you after all Some local options, not online but very good service, I bought parts from these places in the past week:  Paul at klaus marine etobicoke, has some good after market options as we'll. Kim, I think was his name at Central Marine Markham Woman at Bay City Marine Hamilton"
852079,Cosmos,2014-05-05 12:25:00,588,x2 for Central Marine in Markham
852090,jimmer,2014-05-05 13:43:00,2730,You can get that stuff from Robinson Marine in Lindsay. They should ship if that's what you want.
852102,Woodsman,2014-05-05 15:32:00,1286,Try your local UAP/NAPA store. Ask to see the marine catalouge. They can order in many parts but if they have to come from the US wharehouse expect 3 weeks delivery time. 2-3 days if in the Ontario wharehouse.
852204,chris.brock,2014-05-06 00:57:00,4053,"thanks for the help guys,  I took the lower end off today to see if I needed a whole kit or just an impeller, the impeller looked fine and there must be a blockage somewhere else  the moral of the story, start with the simplest solutions first  if you read this, chime in Bernie if you don't mind, with your 2 cents"
852205,mcdougy,2014-05-06 01:03:00,274,"Try a hose at the eject port, hold it up tight and turn her full blast to try and push blockage down. Seems crude but has worked a couple times on different small engines for me."
852210,chris.brock,2014-05-06 01:21:00,4053,"Try a hose at the eject port, hold it up tight and turn her full blast to try and push blockage down. Seems crude but has worked a couple times on different small engines for me.  I used a bicycle tire pump to blast air back in, I'll try your idea too (once I get that stupid linkage cable set up right, Haha)"
852213,Sinker,2014-05-06 01:33:00,8692,A piece of weed whacker line works good for clearing the lines too.  S.
