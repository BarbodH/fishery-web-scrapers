852214,Hooked,2014-05-06 01:34:00,891,"We did alright, between the 2 of us we managed to land 18 fish.  My buddy was .02 ounces from 10th place in the Kiwanis derby, doh!  The fish ranged from 2.5lbs to 10.2lbs.  I can imagine the fishing for the next couple weeks being really good there.  Never experienced the water temp at the opener being 47\48 degrees.  Cold.  Usually around 54\55 this time of year."
