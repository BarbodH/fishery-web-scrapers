790714,gordy28,2013-06-06 00:23:00,638,"Check out Brennan Harbour Not sure they have many weekends available in peak season but they do in the fall Good pike fishing along w walleye, Muskie and big smallmouth It's on the north channel of lake Huron about 6!hours from Mississauga Cheers Gordy"
791012,Moosebunk,2013-06-07 02:06:00,3970,"Maybe look up around Baskatong (8 hours) or a little further?  Fishindevil was probably on to something... because you did post pike and walleye, and that combo within 10 hours of the GTA could be well served in PQ...  GBay I'd think could be OK.  Big Lake Ab if there's an outfitter?  Gogama area?  Do post a report."
791047,jedimaster,2013-06-07 11:23:00,3472,Timing and availability is the biggest issues. A Lot of places I called that have availability won't do a weekend and place that will are booked up.... that should say something to the lodges. haha thanks for all of the suggestions I am going to make another round of calls today and see what I can dig up. For now the best option looks like camping on crown land. Was hoping to get out for some guided fishing but the first round of calls didn't give much in terms of results.
791048,jedimaster,2013-06-07 11:31:00,3472,Do you know how to get there by train? Mar mac that is.does the train go right to the lake or do you need to be picked up? This sounds interesting..
791056,woodenboater,2013-06-07 12:29:00,2277,"Looks like the tracks cross the very bottom part of the lake according to Google maps. From there, looks like a nice boat ride."
791060,jedimaster,2013-06-07 13:05:00,3472,"Checked it out, can't return on a mon."
791064,jedimaster,2013-06-07 13:26:00,3472,"I am all for the drive, I really don't mind, beauchene is a place I wanted to try but there package times don't fit my availability. Will check kipawa"
791068,jedimaster,2013-06-07 13:40:00,3472,"Sounds like Kipawa Lodge might be a good option, waiting for a call back..."
852420,tbills50,2014-05-07 12:22:00,5,"Has anyone been fishing up near Esnagi Lake recently? Is there still ice in that area, and if so, how thick?  Thanks. We are planning on a June 15th trip up to hook some walleyes and pike!  Tom"
852423,BillM,2014-05-07 12:40:00,17367,You should ask your outfitter.
790350,jedimaster,2013-06-04 13:45:00,3472,"Hey guys, I am looking for a place to take my GF fishing. She wants to do some Pike and walleye fishing. I am willing to drive about 10 hours from Toronto. Looking to leave Thursday and come back Monday night.  Can anyone recommend me a place for trophy Northern's? This is a little mini vacation for us. We are looking to go for the long weekend. "
790359,BillM,2013-06-04 14:19:00,17367,Drive to or fly in?
790364,jedimaster,2013-06-04 14:42:00,3472,"Drive To, The extra coin for a fly in this year would be prohibitive. Plus we want to take the new truck for a nice road trip."
790365,Fish4Eyes,2013-06-04 14:46:00,1022,Check PM.
790366,jedimaster,2013-06-04 14:56:00,3472,"Was thinking about the something on the French, seems like a few lodges there. I have a 16' lund but I don't mind renting one as well if the rates are good. Anyone been to Chaudi√®re Lodge? If you want to pm me info about this place or another place please do."
790367,BillM,2013-06-04 15:03:00,17367,I wouldn't consider the French somewhere to go for trophy northerns...  I'd probably find somewhere around Gogama.
790388,Woodsman,2013-06-04 16:32:00,1286,Don't forget at that time of year places for a weekend may be in short supply. Many only rent for the week & with short notice even if they will rent for the weekends they may be already booked.
790400,doubleheader,2013-06-04 17:39:00,497,"Lady Lake Evelyn may have the best walleye bite in eastern Ontario, and good pike as well. I would suggest contacting Ellen Island Lodge if you want to make your own meals or or Red Pine Wilderness Lodge if you want meals provided. Both are known for outstanding hospitality. Either Lodge picks you up at Mowat's Landing in a large pontoon or boat, you travel a very short distance down the Montreal River, to where they portage into Lady Lake Evelyn River. From there it's up river to the lake."
790408,fishindevil,2013-06-04 18:26:00,6254,man go to quebec !!!!! in 10hrs you will be in paradise from toronto....the fishing in quebec is insane..
790409,jedimaster,2013-06-04 18:34:00,3472,Sure but where?
790420,adempsey,2013-06-04 20:07:00,1498,"Might be some nice places on Georgian Bay, but not sure how good the trophy pike fishing would be when you want to go.   Your biggest problem is being able to get a weekend at that time.   Might consider going the private cottage route instead.  For places in Quebec, this site is a nice one to do some research on outfitters."
790428,jedimaster,2013-06-04 21:01:00,3472,"Its likely that we will just do some crown land camping and fishing this time around, but if we can't do it this year we will next year."
790452,Pigeontroller,2013-06-04 21:56:00,2793,Chaudiere is an excellent choice. Not sure you'll get any 'trophy' Northerns but the fishing ain't bad on the Upper French. Steve is a great host and the Lodge and Cabins are very nice. Beautiful water too! Expensive but you'll be completely catered to!  I also highly recoment Totem Point Lodge on the Wolseley Bay section of the French. The food they cook is awesome!
790458,capt_hooked,2013-06-04 22:13:00,212,We had a fishing contest on the West Arm of Nipissing this past weekend... and rumor (good source) has it the winning team landed a 48-inch Northern Pike..!  -
790485,fishindevil,2013-06-05 00:01:00,6254,Well you cannot go wrong with beauchene please google it I can't link it with my phone !!! 5 lb Brooke's 12lb walleye and big pike !!!!!! It's paradise ..... Check it out
790486,fishindevil,2013-06-05 00:03:00,6254,If you want a trip to remember just go !!! You can go to the French anytime drive the 10hrs and catch fish that you will say was worth every cent !!!
790499,fishindevil,2013-06-05 00:27:00,6254,
790500,fishindevil,2013-06-05 00:28:00,6254,I somehow got the link to work !!!! Check it out !!! I think I'm booking a trip there as well
790531,Joeytier,2013-06-05 01:32:00,3990,10 hours gets you to some stellar areas...Timmins area...big ab...Kipawa...wawa/white river...gogama.  If you're giving yourself that much travel time then take advantage of it and go somewhere special
790574,fishindevil,2013-06-05 07:34:00,6254,Yes kip would be on my bucket list too !!! Agree 100%
790579,Rich,2013-06-05 10:05:00,3927,"Well, there's trophy pike anywhere there's pike so I'd say pick a lodge then pick bigger lures than what everyone else is using. Lol"
790607,BLOO KANOO,2013-06-05 13:06:00,20,"Fished the lower French last fall Jedimaster. Stayed at Atwood Island lodge. Reasonable rates. There are campsites on the Lower French as well, if that is what your looking for."
790624,capt_hooked,2013-06-05 14:30:00,212, Well I have been fishing Nipissing for 55 years now... and have fished some great lakes... miles up north... (2-3 hour fly-in)...  and have never caught a 48-inch pike...  I know they are out there... but they do not show often.  How many have you caught?
790626,kennyblackmax,2013-06-05 14:46:00,4,"You might consider training on VIA Rail out of Sudbury to some of the remote lakes and lodges available without having to do all the driving. I would recommend Mar Mac Lodge on Esnagi Lake, this lake is 27 miles long and has no road access and has some of the best Pike and Walleye fishing in Ontario. This lodge was featured this last weekend on the show Canadian Sportfishing. The boats are 18 foot cedar strips with 20 horse 4 strokes, you can also walk to another lake for trophy Brook Trout."
