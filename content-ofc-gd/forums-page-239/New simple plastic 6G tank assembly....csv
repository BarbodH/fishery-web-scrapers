852251,Raycaster,2014-05-06 11:25:00,528,Well not quite assembly but wondering what most people use for the fuel quick connector threading. (Metal to plastic gas connection).  The instructions always point to some kind of special thread sealer but never able to hunt it down at the local stores.  Thanks guys.

852270,Raycaster,2014-05-06 14:07:00,528,Thank you for the reply.  That would be the pink (gas) teflon tape right? Not the white stuff?
852285,DanD,2014-05-06 16:27:00,2223,"I have pulled more slivers of Teflon tape out of fuel pumps, carb needle and seats and injectors then I care to remember. I use this stuff and have never had a problem with leakage or contamination.  http://www.permatex.com/products-2/product-categories/gasketing/gasket-sealants/permatex--aviation-form-a-gasket--no--3-sealant-liquid-detail  Dan."

852351,irishfield,2014-05-06 23:58:00,26272,"It's just liquid Teflon Brian. I've never had a fuel, water or hydraulic leak since I started using it over a decade ago. That said... I'd want to see the ""fit"" between the plastic gas tank and the brass fitting before I committed. If it's fairly snug I'd use the PST592 and if it was a sloppy fit I'd go with DanD's recommendation, to fill the gap and lock it in place.. that or polygrip! lol"
