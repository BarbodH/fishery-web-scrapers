Ummm I ask the same about the percentage of increase from speculation on real estate and fuel, which in turn cause everything we buy to cost us more for less.  As for the cash grab at the MTO, I know about 20,000 pot holes on my commute to work where they could spend some of the increase LOL"

I took her advice.  ????

I simply said I hope people remember at election time what this government has done. Unless we stand up together this will not end but until then we keep booting them in their a$$es.
