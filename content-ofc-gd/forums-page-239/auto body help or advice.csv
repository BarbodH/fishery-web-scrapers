Now my buddies son is 17 6'3"" and 330 lbs. He has every CIS school recruiting him to play football along with several D1 D2 schools in the USA. The kid is a beast,well during his pushing attempts he pushed my tailgate in the size of a large pie. Anyone know if these is fixable by removing the inside panel and pushing it back out or is there a better way to pop it back out? It is on the tailgate of 2008 ford explorer. thanks"
851759,Big Cliff,2014-05-03 18:45:00,6899,I might be wrong but a body shop should be able to pop it back out with a suction cup. never done it myself though.
851863,mattybculp,2014-05-04 10:33:00,388,Blow dryer the spot till it's hot hit it with an a can of compressed air upside down. Having the can upside down is the important thing. I have seen it work amazingly well and others not so much depends on size and location of dent. I'm not an auto body guy but if it works it would have only cost you about 10 bucks for the air which you can pick up at staples etc.
852073,aplumma,2014-05-05 11:27:00,6896,If it does not have a crease to it you should be able to push it back out from the inside. The heat and chill works also but it stresses your paint and in some cases will cause it to peel/flake in the near future. Just keep in mind the force that created the dent needs to be counter acted by a force from the exact opposite direction in both pressure and location for the best results.   Art

852253,BillM,2014-05-06 11:42:00,17367,Some of those dentless repair places can do some amazing work.
852257,manitoubass2,2014-05-06 12:27:00,11391,Howah! Not sure if this is a testement to today's poorly made vehicles or how strong this kid is??? J/k. Id go with the dent repair shops. Since the invention of hail these guys got good:)
852266,fisher,2014-05-06 13:39:00,451,My dad had the same issue and bought a $6 suction cup thing from canadian tire and popped it out himself. Worth a try. It was in the auto aisles. Meant to pull out dents as you described.
852267,fisher,2014-05-06 13:40:00,451,Should add you may need to wet the suction if it doesn't grab at first. And push hard while setting the suction.
