The fellas seem to want to target big pike, Walleye and Muskey occasionally . Last trip we went to LOTW and had a amazing time but thinking something different. We are open to really anything within 24 hour drive but I am leaning towards keeping it under 12 if possible and under the a grand in price?  Your advice is appreciated"
