Do those of you who have Humminbird SI units do you feel that you got your moneys worth out of them? The cost is alittle over $300 dollars and could be used on other tackle if it's not worth it. Also how does the Down Scanning feature work for marking fish?  Thanks for your time and like always, Safe Fishing First, Jack"
