First of all I was impressed by his ingenutity, he is one smart young man! Second by his positive attitude and friendly demeanour. Dan I really enjoyed the time we spent working on that today, If you want to start serving your apprenticeship.....LOL  Oh, and thanks for the ride down to my mechanics, they wouldn't let me have the orange car LOL (not even the hot chick that went with it) heck, I'd have carried her home on my back.  Anyway, mine was all done and ready to go and I got two trimmers to fix for him LOL.  So I look out my window and here are two guys in a boat against my shore line, it's obvious they have a problem so me being me ask if they needed any help. I thought that was a fair question since one guy was in the water trying to hold the boat off the rocks? Guy in the water gives me kind of a ""look"", said no! Motor won't start we're going to get it towed back to camp!  Now normally I'd have said ""well, I'm a small engine mechanic, would you like me to have a look?"" But this guys attitude just kind of struck me the wrong way so I watched as they had some guy in a little boat with a 9.9 come and tow them away and thought to myself ""Go have a cold beer Cliff""! IT'S Saturday!"
