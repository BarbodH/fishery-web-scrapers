All the males in the class wrote:  ""A woman, without her man, is nothing.""  All the females in the  class wrote: ""A woman: without her, man is nothing.""  Punctuation is powerful."

It was freshman composition, listed as English 101.  I received a C, thought that was pretty good, and quickly signed up for English 102 under the same professor.  Got another C and was glad to have the course behind me."

472130,Roy,2010-06-03 11:23:00,13728,A woman without? Her man is NOTHING.
472150,Tarzan's Jane,2010-06-03 13:11:00,1183," That's not bad Roy....but ""A woman without?"" is grammatically incorrect.  Therefore you fail!"
