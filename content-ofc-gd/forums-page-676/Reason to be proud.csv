I never served on the Bonnie but we spend alot of time sailing with her on a couple different trips. Certainly nothing in comparison to the size of the British or American carriers but she served her purpose well in the Canadian Navy.  Here's a couple rather poor shots I took of Bonnie back in the 60's but I honestly can't remember where the heck it was. In the one picture you can make out the Tracker aircraft on the flight deck. I always enjoyed cruising along side her and watching the aircraft land and take-off from that small deck. Takes a special kind of talent and guts from the guys who do that kinda work.      Most of the men in my family have served in different branches of the Armed Forces in both peacetime & war going all the way back to my Grandfather in WW1, and with this being the 100th anniversary of the Canadian Navy, I'm proud of the fact that we served in the Navy too.  I did most of my time on the Annapolis in the mid 60's    My brother did his time on Columbia, also in the mid 60's    And my Dad served with honor for 5 years during WW2 after leaving the farm in Saskatchewan at 18 years old to fight for his country. He was on a few different ships but his favorite was the Corvette Kitchener when they escorted to convoys to Europe and North Africa    Thanks again for posting your story Bruce, the Canadian Military never gets the publicity like the Brits or Americans, but Canadians can be as proud of those that protect us as any country on the planet.  And congrats to the Canadian Navy for 100 years of great service !!  Infact, many years ago I knew a man who was in the very 1st class of Navy recruits when the RCN was formed 100 years ago."
