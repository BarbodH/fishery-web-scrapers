Its been pretty productive, but its not easy fishing for my two year old son because its pretty shallow and there are tons of rocks to snag. This weekend we decided to look for some bass and head to deeper waters. We hit up a nearby lake armed with LiveTarget smelt - I have been itching to use it since I got back from Toronto earlier this month.    It didn't take long to hook the first fish - a nice little smallmouth on the first cast!  I decided to hand the rod over to my son and within minutes he had his first fish of the day too! I thought it was still pretty early in the season for bass, but they were all over this little lure. He even had a couple of perch to end the day!      And finally when he realized that bass and perch arent quite as soft as trout, he quickly adapted to using the ole lip grip!     I did some solo fishing the next day and got into some nicer fish, the biggest around 2 lbs - but sadly forgot the camera at home!"

471375,Handlebarz,2010-05-31 19:18:00,3790,great shots Clive nice to see the youngster taking after the old man
471383,bigugli,2010-05-31 19:57:00,6138,"Looks like the pools around Dartmouth/Halifax. You can find some real Hawgs in town, just don't let the oldtimers know you're fishing for garbage.  Cute little fella you got there."
471393,highdrifter,2010-05-31 20:50:00,2534,What a trooper!!  He's rocking the fury pose just like his old man.  Way to go brother.  HD
472222,mepps,2010-06-03 16:02:00,1301,He's got the bug for sure!  Whenever we are in the basement he asks me to look at the musky lures I have hanging up!
472321,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-03 21:11:00,932," Hahaha, yeah, it's great seeing a youngster with ""the bug.""  My nephew is 6 and all he ever wants to do (besides actually fishing) is go through tackle boxes and read fishing books.  Great report and great pictures.  Ryan"
