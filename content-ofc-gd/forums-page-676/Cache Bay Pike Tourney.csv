Average depth of Cache Bay this year is 2.5'  26 teams out of 224 caught their 6 fish...122 caught 0. and many teams quit early.  We managed 1 fish 24.5""... and a sunburn  I missed 15 or so while using a Johnson's Silver Minnow tipped with a Yellow Twister Tail.... I think that the weedguard on the lure prevented a good hookset..???  I'll try again next year.  Take Off Video.   RFS "

Allthough we do have the option of going anywhere on Nip.  I'll keep your post in mind and stay away from cach bay, especially if there aint any fish."
471984,curlrap,2010-06-02 20:45:00,58,There's no fish in Nipissing.
471989,Muskieman,2010-06-02 20:55:00,2472, What are you complaining about?     You caught/measured  2... that means that you out fished me 100% and beat me.  But that also means that we got beat by more than 100 teams  If you're not working tomorrow ... I'm going up the river.  Randy
