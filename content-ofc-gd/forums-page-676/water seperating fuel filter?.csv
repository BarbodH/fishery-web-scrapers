471511,siwash,2010-06-01 04:18:00,683,Anyone use these things? Sierra brand.. Are they necessary?   I just bought some Stabil ethanol treatment so I am wondering if the water separator is required still.  Thanks

471546,canadadude,2010-06-01 12:58:00,769,"Used them on the inboards, Diesal motors never thought they would be needed on a 2 stroke outboard,I think that maybe overkill you should be ok with a good stabalizer"
471571,lew,2010-06-01 14:46:00,12766,My Skeeter/Yamaha combo came factory equipped with a water/fuel seperator so that tells me they must be a good thing.

471683,siwash,2010-06-01 20:44:00,683,Thanks!
471692,dagoat_1,2010-06-01 21:12:00,72,I'm with Lew on this. My 99 Evinrude 90hp 2-stroke has one built in so I dont see why you wouldn't want a water seperator.
471803,siwash,2010-06-02 03:47:00,683,Where can you buy them? I suppose any marine dealer?
471805,irishfield,2010-06-02 03:51:00,26272, My Verado has one right on the engine! Kicker is on it's own... lol
472450,fish_fishburn,2010-06-04 09:16:00,1311,My EFI Merc has one built into the motor as well. As a matter of fact I just replace it with a new one this spring. Think it was around 20 bucks.
