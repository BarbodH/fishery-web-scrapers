470415,fish-miester,2010-05-28 03:22:00,864,stop rubbing it in Syn ! haha how much did you say they were again ?.. If your ever lookin to sell one.. or both.. you know who to get in touch with..
470417,Syn,2010-05-28 03:44:00,519," Those little ones 4-5"" swimbaits you liked were about $12-15 (shipping included) on ebay. Totally reasonable price imo for that awesome looking shape and paint job. Some of those sammy types were on average $5 shipped. So its totally within many budgets considering spinnerbaits in Toronto are $6-8+ and taxes. Hardest part was being patient waiting for good sales. If I don't lose them then I'll pass them down to kids fishing.  The sebile softs were $13+5 for shipping. I cringed considering I only get 3 soft plastics for that price. But oh well, if they work as good as they look then it will make for some good fishing memories.   I'm really liking these frogs you guys (mostly Mikethebassfisher) were taking about in the frog thread. You guys opened my eyes to how good the frogs have become. Thats going to be my new slop bass toy this season. They sure came a long way from when I remember using frogs. This thing has a super sharp hooks , jointed eye to hook wire so the bass can't throw it out easily, a rattle and a lead weight in the rear end to keep its butt down. Bobby's perfect frog its called."
470484,fish-miester,2010-05-28 13:02:00,864,"hmm tempting me with all of the above syn, I dont have a credit card any more tho.. got one maxed it out.. then was in debt.. paid it off and shredded the card.. so I guess I'll have to get some1 to order me some..  as for frogs Im HIGHLY interested in ""Ish's Phat Frog"" made by snag proof"
472484,Syn,2010-06-04 12:40:00,519,"Not a new technique but it will be new for me:  Donkey rigging http://www.ultimateb...p?topic=50871.0  I'm liking this plastic, almost tempted to use a dropshot hook (probably use a thin wire 2/0 worm hook)> http://www.skinnybea...om/shadeye2.php"
469825,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-26 13:26:00,3761,"Hey everybody, looking to get some more tackle this weekend and I'm asking to see if there is anything that came up over the winter that I should try for bass this season. It could be new plastics, hardbaits or spinnerbaits. What ever it is share the info so I can look for some cool stuff. Also, would like to give soft plastic swimbaits a try this season. Berkley Hollow Belly or Money Minnow???  Thanks for reading, maybe well hear of some new gear!  MTBF"
469834,BillM,2010-05-26 13:40:00,17367,"If you don't have a Zara Spook in your box, you should probably pick one up."
469844,GBW,2010-05-26 14:12:00,8460,"Hey Mike, the Walmart in Whitby had a sell off bin of lures for $3.00 each and they had Spooks in it!  You should check your local one and see if they have any deals on lures.  Even if you have some of what's in the bin it's good to have a backup at that price..."
469846,ColdH20guy,2010-05-26 14:14:00,312,some soft plastics..hope this works        
469848,ColdH20guy,2010-05-26 14:17:00,312,sorry guys..the first 2 were too small     thx  dang it..still are!
469866,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-26 15:12:00,3761,"Hmm, I got a zara puppy(small spook) but I really dont use it. When I fish open water top water i fish Skitter pops. I'm a popper guy I guess but I'll check out wal mart.  Thanks guys!  As for the plastics all I'll really use are 3 and 4"" chigger craws, and 5"" senkos...snag proof frogs, spinnerbaits and flipping jigs.  Targeting big fish this summer, no more 2lb and under photo's haha"
469870,BIG FISH,2010-05-26 15:25:00,54,  buckeye lures mop jigs are great if your looking for big bites. as for hollow bellie swimbaits berkley hollow belly and the ones that bassmagnet maakes are the best ones on the market as far as im concerned. the spro little john md is a wicked crankbait you might want to try.another swimbait you might want to try is the jerry rago bv 3d line through theyre expensive but they got great action
469871,Roy,2010-05-26 15:25:00,13728,"Mike, they have dotted lines out now! You catch every other fish!"
469874,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-26 15:28:00,3761,Roy...your a funny guy sometimes bud haha
469914,Syn,2010-05-26 17:30:00,519,I'm gonna try these this summer. Sebile Magic Swimmer Soft Swimbait
469921,mbosh1980,2010-05-26 17:40:00,349,I had a lot of luck last year with the rapala wakebait.
469927,solopaddler,2010-05-26 18:00:00,8605,"Not exactly new, but Basstrix hollow bodied swimbaits. If you can find them."
469936,Dutchy,2010-05-26 18:21:00,416,"My go to bait now is Berkeley heavy weight worms. I have caught fish on these no matter where I have fished and they hit them very hard. When nothing else has worked these have every time.  They are not widely available in Canada yet from what I have seen. Cabela's, Wholesale Sports and BPS have them, but often on back order"
469941,Harrison,2010-05-26 18:28:00,2202,Forget about swimbaits... the words out!  
469951,Jackie,2010-05-26 19:01:00,124,   LOL!!!!!!!
469970,lookinforwalleye,2010-05-26 20:50:00,4399,ya gotta watch out for those evil doer`s!!!
470069,Dutch,2010-05-27 01:45:00,831,"I have read many of the guys in the states are using flutter spoons with some success.  Also can't beat a big flipping jig with a good chunk on it for big bass.  Cigar sized senko type baits have got me a big bass or two in the past - 7"" minimum."
470188,MSBruno,2010-05-27 15:31:00,369, I've been eye'ing these too.  Amazing action.
470191,fish-miester,2010-05-27 15:36:00,864,"  same!   as for new stuff the guys were on the money when they said Spooks ! I love spooks.. but thats cuz i probably have ADD and hate to ""pause"" my lures.. such as poppers. and much rather walk them. and have caught fish on them bass-pike-musky.. as for soft body swimbaits I baught a wack of them and never really got into it.. a few of my friends did.. and they do catch fish.  other then that being said I know personally that ya sure I'll keep adding to my tackle.. but I like to ""learn new techniques and try to perfect them"" instead of letting all my tackle pile up.. and pushing the less used lures into the corner.. only because i dont like them or never took the time to find out if they will catch me fish!  but hey new gear is always fun to play with.."
470334,sandmann,2010-05-27 21:57:00,51," I love the way wakebaits look in the water but I've never caught anything on them yet.  So, I'm really glad to read this post.  I'll have to give them another shot"
470341,fish-miester,2010-05-27 22:07:00,864,Sandmann every time I went out fishing I made sure I had a Bomber or rapala Wake bait tied on..! they work great!
470347,Syn,2010-05-27 22:18:00,519, I'll post what I catch on them and get back to you guys on my next fishing trip. Likely they will be ripped apart because of pike.    @fish-meister . You talking about the Zara spooks? I tried those way back when they first came out and over the years. I'm not so good at imparting action with them like the pro do. This winter I found the Sammy type topwater lures that I've been told make walking the dog is a lot easier and the rear end sits lower in the water for easier hookups. I'm hesitant to go out now and try them cause I don't walk to get accused of OOS bass.  Sammy
470358,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-27 22:59:00,3761,"Poppers rule! after my PB bass I love them haha, it's definitely a patience bait and its hard not to set the hook when the fish hits the bait but I practiced for at least 45 morning last summer and I got it down to a tee. haha"
470365,fish-miester,2010-05-27 23:30:00,864,ya Syn I have been looking at those Sammy's tempted. My goal this year is to get one of those beauty hardbody swimbaits that you teased me with when every1 was showing off there tackle/gear..!
470367,Syn,2010-05-27 23:36:00,519," Yeah I can't wait to try them too..in deeper water. I heard the 5"" ones are good for trophy bass too."
