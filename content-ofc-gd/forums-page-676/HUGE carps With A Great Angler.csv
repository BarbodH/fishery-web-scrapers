471096,Fishing 24/7,2010-05-30 22:42:00,709,Well rob my fish buddy was kind enough To bring me and whitespinnerbait For some carp today.   little did i know i was in for the ride of my life.  Here is a Sneak peak of what happened.  First in line is me.    i grab the rod and set the hook.  after a AWESOME fight i land my first and biggest fish ever at 19 lbs.    Then its whitespinnerbaits turn at the 12 ' rod.  he lands a nice bottom feeder.  His very first also.      after seeing these BEAST gold fish i fell on my    and said to myself.  they cant be bigger than this.  well ROB showed me a thing or 125 about carp fishing.    he lands a 21 lbs NUGGET!  But the best part of the day was yet to come.      Two lines go off. and they are both over sized CARPS....  Well after a 10 minute fight we both land these PIGS and that made my day RIGHT THERE!  To know the full story and to view more pictures.  Rob posted the full story on his Blog.  Check it out  head to RJ's site at www.rjnbirdeesoutdooradventures.ca

471106,Whitespinnerbait,2010-05-30 23:42:00,2038,"Awesome day spent on the Banks of the St Lawrence River...  At one point I did have a  '' FREIGHT TRAIN ''  on the end of my line , But it headed for the current and the 50lb test cut off on a sharp rock...    Thanks for the Great Day .......RJ"
471127,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-31 00:23:00,3761,"Looks fun, caught my first Carp of 2010 today lol, nothing like yours but it was fun!"
471130,Paully,2010-05-31 00:26:00,712,Wait till one steals your rod right off the bank! Thats a rush
471170,splashhopper,2010-05-31 02:19:00,2931,"saw a pile of them today on my way back....  damned if I didn;t land a little one too....   Glad u had fun,,,, they are a BLAST !"
471386,hammercarp,2010-05-31 20:05:00,964,WTG guys. The fight in that strong current must be incredible.
471387,TC1OZ,2010-05-31 20:10:00,987,"I wish I had a cool story about loosing a fish with 50 Lbs test on! hahaha. Sounds like a blast! I love catching carp! Sometimes the bite is slow and discouraging, but once you've landed a monster you know why people come back!"
471553,MJL,2010-06-01 13:43:00,2427,Well done guys...Beautiful fish...I absolutely love that river - I'm hoping to be there in September.  St. Lawrence carp are the strongest carp I've ever had the pleasure of fighting.  Great report
471554,mepps,2010-06-01 13:47:00,1301,"Great stuff, you sure have caught a lot of pound of fish this spring!"
471681,dsn,2010-06-01 20:42:00,1018, Yeah I had the rush happen to me twice. Both times the fish sent me walking home empty handed. (no gear) Never eat a bag of Hostess and let your rod do all thew work .
471721,Fishing 24/7,2010-06-01 23:29:00,709,  note to DSN leave your spool open!
471728,muskymatt,2010-06-01 23:47:00,2608, That's because they are either not married or have no kids...employment unknown...that said they sure as hell know how to fish and have the passion to drive them...Rob is an ambassador in his own right and anyone who get the opportunity to tag along with him is a lucky angler.  Great report guys
