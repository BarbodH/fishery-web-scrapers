472093,TC1OZ,2010-06-03 01:58:00,987,I'm sure NRP will get right on top of that one.
472096,marth11,2010-06-03 02:10:00,60,you mean the donut brigade me thinks we need the opp for this one cause this is one of the signs of a psycho
472113,pikeguy,2010-06-03 03:11:00,195, i grew up on the other side of the canal from there as kids we would go there often and enjoy the animals. There are way to many freaks out there
472114,vinnimon,2010-06-03 03:19:00,2593,"I can see yotes doing there rounds,but this is plain out pathetic,esp a petting zoo."
472116,packrat,2010-06-03 03:31:00,93,"Not just wrong its sick and St Kitts doesnt have a lock on ""people"" who get off on torturing animals.  According to news stories over the past few weeks Windsor has its share just not in numbers like this.  The most recent was a black lab that had to be put down because its genitals were destroyed from a sex act with a human."
472142,livinisfishin,2010-06-03 12:44:00,661,This is disgusting why even post about the black lab and just keep your posts about the incidents but sparing the details..
472147,canadadude,2010-06-03 13:06:00,769,sick freaks
472185,packrat,2010-06-03 14:19:00,93,"  I'm sorry if you found the post offensive----the details were there only as an example of how low some ""people"" can sink into depravity."
472196,fishing n autograph,2010-06-03 14:55:00,2540,Yeah I think the O dots and the behavioural unit needs to get on this...and lay off the donut jokes
