472137,marrex_mike,2010-06-03 12:27:00,40,Has anyone seen the huge article about that snakefish that they think is starting to invade the great white north?? This is the worst thing that could happen to our local fishing waters. This thing has lungs and gills so it could live out of water for up to 4 days and they say that if it comes our local fish don't stand a chance... If you don't know about it look it up it really makes you think.
472139,Lunkerhunter,2010-06-03 12:38:00,455,there is like at least 5 threads about this on here.

472154,mepps,2010-06-03 13:23:00,1301,I thought this was just a joke post...
472158,dsn,2010-06-03 13:42:00,1018,Nope its real. I posted a link to a vid from youtube on the other post what this nasty fish can do. But I'll post it here to just incase......        dsn  
472161,Flappn,2010-06-03 13:49:00,245,Why is a kid watching a fish eat another fish?
472203,Lunker777,2010-06-03 15:08:00,866,"I dont get why these things are gettin so much attention all of a sudden ???? Ive seen literally 10 posts from this site and others regarding this fish in the last 4 days !!!!!!!  The video is bogus.... its pretty easy to starv a fish in a tank so when you feed it, it just goes nuts.  Bite a fish in half ???? he ripped the TAIL off.... It didnt look like anything more then what a northern or musky would do !!!  I dunno... I think alot of people are over reacting !!!"
472216,blaque,2010-06-03 15:45:00,2419,"I think he meant that he thought it was a joke that another post was started lol. Not that the fish in general was a joke  And i just watched the guy from ""River Monsters"" fish for these the other day"
