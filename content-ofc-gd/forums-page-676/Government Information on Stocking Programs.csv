I've been talking to a few old-timers recently and they were saying that finding out information on bodies of water is easy via the MNR.  Specifically, I am interested in finding areas that have been stocked with ANY species of fish near my home, but not the common bodies of water that I currently fish.  What is the best way to attain this information from the MNR?  If you have any stories about dealing with the MNR in this manner, please feel free to share them."

If anyone has any decent stories, you can still feel free to post them, but I've got all the info I need to move forward.  My search of the website came up empty for stocking, so weird that it was there the whole time."
