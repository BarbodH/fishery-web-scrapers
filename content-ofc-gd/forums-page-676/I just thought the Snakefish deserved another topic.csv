472302,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-03 20:36:00,932,"Have you guys heard about this Snakefish thing (more than 8 times?)  I heard its as tall as a giant and shoots lightning bolts out of its ________ (movie reference guess gets you 1 point).  Jokes . . . Jokes.  What are everyone's fishing plans for the weekend?  Are you going to get some Musky-Hunting in?  Are you going to take advantage of this week's rain and go after some trout?  Are you working?  Or are you going to go fishless, like me, sitting at the would-be-inlaws place thinking of wandering around for spec streams."
472315,Governator,2010-06-03 21:04:00,879,"Sitting at my in-laws, leaving tomorrow night to Owen Sound."
472322,Terry,2010-06-03 21:16:00,14456,I am going fishing with the GREAT AND POWERFUL Lloyd
472366,aplumma,2010-06-03 23:12:00,6896,I really am going to fish for Snakeheads. Since I have a ready supply locally I would be foolish not to.   Art

472376,danbouck,2010-06-03 23:51:00,4380,Taking the boat out of the water Sunday    Will probably hit some creeks Saturday night
472377,Roy,2010-06-03 23:53:00,13728, Something wrong with the boat?
472381,danbouck,2010-06-04 00:05:00,4380," Nope, just gonna get her all cleaned up for Lakair. Want to spend the following weekend getting it 100% ready to hook up and go on the Thursday"

472541,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-04 16:27:00,932," DING - 1pt for the quote - I thought it would be a no-brainer.  It is 100% confirmed for me now, my weekend will be fishless until at least Sunday evening - sitting at the girlfriend's family's place in Wyoming (unless anyone knows some spec streams that I can sneak off too).  Sigh."
472567,Dutchy,2010-06-04 18:14:00,416,"My parents are coming over from Scotland. I will be fishless for 3 weeks, but I do get to see my parents."
