471676,addymark,2010-06-01 20:28:00,69,holy biology batman!  where is the reference list??
471679,fish-miester,2010-06-01 20:37:00,864,"what do you legally need to ""bow"" carp?"
471687,lhousesoccer,2010-06-01 20:54:00,442,"No problem.  I'm kinda in to fish biology  There are certainly alot of local colloquial names for alot of different fish species.  Burbot for example, can be called ling, or ling-cod, or cusk, depending on where you are.  I've heard bowfin called dogfish.  Where I live now (Vermont), people call brook trout simply ""natives"" and if you say brookie to them, they don't know what you mean!  They also call lake trout ""togue"".  It's different everywhere you go!  But the point I often try to make to people when I give presentations on fisheries biology is that when you have two fish that look similar with similar shapes and features, it doesn't always mean they are the same or even related, outside of just being fish!  I hear you on the native versus invasive though.  One man's garbage ... as the saying goes.  Look at rainbows, steelhead and brown trout.  All non-natives to eastern North America, and all of North America in the case of brown trout.  But we all love to fish for them.  Smallies were spread by train car in the early 1900's right across northern Ontario.  Who's to say what's right and wrong any more.  Man has spread everything pretty much everywhere.  There are some I don't think I want in my waters any time soon though, and that includes snakehead and Asian carp!"
471696,aplumma,2010-06-01 21:34:00,6896,"No I agree with you their the Asian Carp and the Snakehead would not be my first choice for fish I want to be in my waters. However since the window for eradication has pasted I put the best spin I can on them and I can tell you those puppies fight like few freshwater fish ever have. I was amazed at the battle it took getting the fish in it was both visual jumping in the air and a full heads on tug of war for 7 minutes. I was fishing with a 7ft medium heavy rod, shimano core reel and 20 lb power pro so their was a lot of pressure on him to come up and get released. The pattern to fish is very similar to fishing for pike in the weeds using lures that are in the top 1 ft of the water column. Once they see it hold on they will blow up the bait multiple times till they have it and then lock jaw occurs even after you get them in the boat. If you want to you can even keep him around for the rest of the day if you keep him moist he has primitive lungs that allow him to gulp air in low oxygen conditions. Kind of like fishin with your drunk buddy after he passes out on yaa.   Art"
471906,Lunkerhunter,2010-06-02 16:27:00,455,if i ever catch one of those things i will make sure the ugly thing is long gone. who cares how hard they fight....
471937,Guest gbfisher,2010-06-02 18:02:00,0,  They've opened up all the lakes for Bow fishing now. It's only a matter of time until we see the Asian carp show up. With a fish that can weigh up to 75 lbs or more..  ..it'll be a ton of fun shooting them I can tell ya.  Population control hasnt been something everyone understands or agrees with.
470800,aplumma,2010-05-29 21:33:00,6896,Here yaa go let the fight begin.      This is a 9lb Snakehead that has taken up residence in the Potomac river. While they are an invasive species they have all of the characteristics of a pike as far as habitat and food goes but they are all fin... boy do they fight. We finished the day with 4 bass (in season here) and 2 snake heads the other was only 4 lb's and was released at the boat side.
470804,John,2010-05-29 21:38:00,2956,"What's their native country Art? Are they considered ""welcome"" or not in the Potomac?"
470811,walleye_man,2010-05-29 21:51:00,135,hey is there any difference between bowfin and snakehead?
470813,Burtess,2010-05-29 21:55:00,901," They are native to Asia and Africa, and are banned in USA and most of Canada.  They are voracious feeders and have a primitive ""lung"" which they can recirculate water to facilitate breathing on land.  The one above is a Northern Snakehead, Channa argus, which can live in cooler waters. It is unfortunate that the smaller and only tropical species are restricted as well, since they make a very nice single specimen in a large aquarium.  Burt"
470828,BillM,2010-05-29 22:19:00,17367,I hope you killed it.
470831,aplumma,2010-05-29 22:31:00,6896,  Nope swam away just fine.  I also fish for the Blue Catfish which was also forcasted to destroy the fisheries both haven't happened. Given my druthers I would rather catch the 50 lb Blue Catfish and the Snakeheads both are alot more fun than bass. Even though the bass were also deemed an invasive species at one point in the Potomacs history and now it is one of the top bass fisheries in the Nation.    Art
470837,canadadude,2010-05-29 22:53:00,769,"Back in the 80's I had a 5 lb snakehead in a 200gal aquarium, while cleaning the tank it jumped out and took me over an hr to find, it flipped under the bed. I thought that was it but I tossed it back in the tank and way it went on it's business. It was a mean freaking fish, I fed it creek chub I got in the creeks couldn't afford to give it feeder gold fish.  That one should of been killed, I guess some people respect the enviroment more then others.I wouldn't think the native species in that watershed think the snakeheads are alot of FUN"
470856,Guest gbfisher,2010-05-30 00:26:00,0,As kids we used to feed one as much as it would eat. It would end up as rounds as it was long. Oscars and Piranha didn't compare...  Frigg in gluttons!!! Nasty eating machine.
470867,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-30 01:12:00,3761,"I bet ya a Bowfin would out fight a Snakehead??? lol, I'm the bowfin king...watch me later this season man"
470873,danc,2010-05-30 01:25:00,4677, Killing a Snakehead in the Potomac to try to control the population is like killing one smelt in Lake Ontario and hoping that you're actually reducing the population. Do some research Bill.
470879,Daplumma,2010-05-30 01:34:00,1961,"We are working on a skeet launcher that will fling the fish in the ar so we can hit it with some double ought buck.So far only the soft ray fish like minnows,chubs, and trout get a good enough launch to miss the motor on the boat.Small fish rock! Joe"
470883,danc,2010-05-30 01:37:00,4677, Sharpen up your archery skills Joe. That's how real men catch them.
470885,BillM,2010-05-30 01:43:00,17367, I was assuming this was a new species similar to the whole asian carp fiasco in Lake Michigan.
470891,Daplumma,2010-05-30 01:58:00,1961,Like this Dan?  Catch and release..into a steamer.
470893,danc,2010-05-30 02:03:00,4677, That's what I'm talkin' about Joe.
470900,[emailÂ protected],2010-05-30 02:10:00,15,"  That's not an asian carp, it's a common carp and it's been in north america longer than you have. People have failed trying to fight it off....."
470904,Daplumma,2010-05-30 02:21:00,1961, My asain buddies steam it up like a sauna at the gym.It has been here longer than my 50 years here for sure. Joe
470906,danc,2010-05-30 02:30:00,4677, I'm talking about archery. And I'll bet that I've been in North America longer than you have.
470916,Guest gbfisher,2010-05-30 03:14:00,0,"  Way to much fun if ya ask me and I know, you didnt.... I'm taking my Carpin rig with me tomorrow. Saw way to much boiling last time up. Should be a blast..."
470978,aplumma,2010-05-30 15:02:00,6896,here is a link to the research that is ongoing and why removing one or two at a time has failed.   report on snake heads in the potomac  Last year there were 6 snakeheads arrowed from the dock were I have the big boat slipped.   Art
471622,TC1OZ,2010-06-01 17:19:00,987,  That looks like a lot of fun... I don't eat carp so I'd feel bad killing it and not eating it.  I'd love to try this with someone who's going to eat the fish afterward lol.
471623,TJQ,2010-06-01 17:33:00,7806,   EEEWWWWWWWW!!!! WHAT THE HELL IS THAT???
471636,lhousesoccer,2010-06-01 18:13:00,442,"That's not entirely true.  It's a cumulative thing.  One adult northern snakehead with produce 13,000 to 15,000 eggs per spawn at a frequency of 1-5 spawns per year.  One dead snakehead relates to ALOT failed reproductive potential.  One angler killing one snakehead - maybe no big deal.  But if EVERY angler killed every snakehead they caught, cumulatively, it can add up.  Several US states with established snakehead populations have imposed fishing regulations that PROHIBT the live release of snakehead, if caught.  It's only the right thing to do with such an invasive species."
471637,lhousesoccer,2010-06-01 18:22:00,442,"Art - I'm not sure where you're getting your taxonomic classification information on snakehead and bowfin, but you're way off.  All organisms on earth can be classified into the following breakdown:  Kingdom Phylum Class Order Family Genus Species  Genus and species are what most anglers with a basic understanding of fish biology would be familiar with.  For example, the Genus and Species of some of the fish we go for would be:  Largemouth bass - Genus: Micropterus, Species: salmoides Smallmouth bass - Genus: Micropterus, Species: dolomieu Yellow Perch - Genus: Perca, Species: flavescens Northern pike - Genus: Esox, Species: Lucius Muskellunge - Genus: Esox, Species: masquinongy Brook trout - Genus: Salvelinus, Species: fontinalis Lake trout - Genus: Salvelinus, Species: namaycush  The K-P-C-O-F-G-S classification breakdown is how scientists describe the relatedness of species.  Clearly, largemouth and smallmouth bass are related Species since they share the same Genus.  Same as northern pike and muskie, and brook and lake trout.  However, you have to go back a step further to see other relations, like yellow perch, and largemouth and smallmouth bass.  All 3 species are in the CENTRARCHIDAE Family, which is the sunfish family.  Now look at bowfin and snakehead.  Northern Snakehead:  Kingdom - Animalia Phylum - Chordata Class - Actinopterygii Order - Perciformes Family - Channidae Genus - Channa Species - Argus  Bowfin:  Kingdom - Animalia Phylum - Chordata Class - Actinopterygii Order - Amiiformes Family - Amiidae Genus - Amia Species - Calva   Now look at some bass and trout:  Largemouth Bass:  Kingdom - Animalia Phylum - Chordata Class - Actinopterygii Order - Perciformes Family - Centrarchidae Genus - Micropterus Species - salmoides  Brook Trout:  Kingdom - Animalia Phylum - Chordata Class - Actinopterygii Order - Salmoniformes Family - Salmonidae Genus - Salvelinus Species - Fontinalis   For interest sake, here's tarpon:  Tarpon:  Kingdom - Animalia Phylum - Chordata Class - Actinopterygii Order - Elopiformes Family - Megalopidae Genus - Megalops Species - atlanticus   As you can see, just about all known fish species fall into the Class Actinopterygii.  That's as much relatedness bowfin and snakehead share, because they diverge significantly after that.  Yellow perch and largemouth bass are more related than bownfin and snakehead are."
471667,aplumma,2010-06-01 20:02:00,6896," 1HOUSESOCCER  Sorry on this point technically you are right realistically they are already established and no amount of killin is going to reverse the species foothold. This colony covers over 50 miles of waterways and has a very strong shad population to feed on.If you follow the link I posted previously you will see the map and the reported catches as far as DNR has documented. The people who are on the river have caught quite a few more and consider them a challenge to fish and catch.  I fish for the other invasive species Blue Catfish that were stocked in 1981 with no ill effects to the rivers health. It was also a kill them as you catch them advisory. The Blue catfish has a large following and accounts for a lot of fishing dollars both in tackle, guided trips and tournaments.   Thanks though for the biology lesson. What we called a Bowfin in Louisiana was always identified to me as a ""shoepic"" or ""snakehead"" by my elders. Back then we worried more about how to cook a fish than how to classify one and it appears it has allowed my ignorance to show in public here.  Art"
