The candies are being produced in a number of varieties, from generic “fresh office” to specific smells which mimic famous perfumes.  After being eaten, they produce what the company call “exit aromas” — which are said to be as effective as air fresheners.  A spokesman for the company, Dmitry Chistilin, told Metro about the product line. “We are creating a fart with a smell of Calvin Klein,” he said.  “I ate (one) with an exit aroma ‘fresh office.’  It’s the same principle as air freshener. There are no digestive disorders after it and the candy works for about two hours.”  The company is now attempting to patent the technology, he added.  One pack of the candy will cost around US$3.25. The different aromas offered so far include Sensation, Clara, and Calvin Klein. There are plans to produce more than 35 smells in all. It’s not known when the candy will be available in Canada."""

471947,Fisherman,2010-06-02 18:32:00,7201," You're right about that, they build up sooo much pressure it causes them to keep talking and gossiping allll the time, at least guys have to take a breath now and then....touche."
471951,dsn,2010-06-02 18:43:00,1018,"  Anything that moves has to release it gases some how. Even the transit trains have to occasionally stop and release it gases before the train can go any further. I've noticed it sometimes it can't go anymore and then it stops for minutes. Then all of a sudden, all the gas or exhust comes spewing out and its loud too.  And the train start to move off again with no problems.  If women don't far then I'd run when they do !!  Cause passing gas once in a blue moon can be deadly for the folks around them. Its more concentrated, and toxic.  Guys fire them off ,once and a while and doesn't let it build up over the days, months, and years.   dsn"
