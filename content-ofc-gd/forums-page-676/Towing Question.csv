472260,LucG,2010-06-03 17:53:00,779,"I recently found a really good deal on a hitch and receiver for my Ford Ranger. My question is about its size. It is a 1 1/4"" hitch, with 2"" ball.  I asked a few people if its size was suffisent before installing, and was told I shouldnt have any issues. It is in fact rated for 300 lbs tongne weight & 3000 lbs towing. Then I received a few oposing comments....  The only thing I will be towing is my boat (16 ft allu. lund) and my quad (Outlander 500 with small atv trailer)  Should I have gone with the larger size hitch, or will I be just fine?  Thanks"

472287,DRIFTER_016,2010-06-03 19:32:00,10439,You're good to go!! That Class II hitch will be fine for what you're doing.
472288,pikeguy,2010-06-03 19:35:00,195,your good to go. I tow my boat on my bumper ball and i have a 16 foot fiberglass boat 
472294,LucG,2010-06-03 19:48:00,779,Great!  I'll be able to tow with my mind at ease now.  Thanks
472298,Muskieman,2010-06-03 20:11:00,2472,No problem with that Class II.  RFS 
472334,Pigeontroller,2010-06-03 21:37:00,2793,"I had a class II hitch on my GMC Safari, It attached to the bumber bracket, not the frame. Of course, many people are towing with a unibody design and thats pretty much a big bumber bracket! I have a class III on my Nissan Xterra, not because I need the 5000 lb. tow capacity, but the security of a frame mounted hitch."
