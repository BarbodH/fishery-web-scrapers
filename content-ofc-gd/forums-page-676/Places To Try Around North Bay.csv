470992,Black_Blade,2010-05-30 16:46:00,258,"I have a 14 foot Sportspal with a 3 HP outboard and just have a minivan.  Hoping for some suggestions of places to try...not particular for species- they are all good.  Had suggestions to drift along the shoreline of Nipissing, but I imagine that would be tough with just the outboard motor.  I live five minutes from Trout Lake, but that is a pretty big lake as well to tackle with a 3 hp when you don't know where to go...lol."
471102,Muskieman,2010-05-30 23:30:00,2472,Eh! Black!    try hwy 11 North... Like Lk Turcotte and that chain..right by the Tomiko Restaurant.... or even hit up Morrison's pond for some Jumbo's and Splake... how 'bout Marion Lk just north of the 64 turn off..  or you could head to Sturgeon and try the upper river...Lk Tomiko?.. Muskasung in Field... and then there are tons of lakes north of River Valley on Hwy 805 that would suit your needs. All accessible by Canoe and Minivan.  Randy
