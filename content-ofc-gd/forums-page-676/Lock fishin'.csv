471975,Paully,2010-06-02 20:08:00,712,A buddy and I plan on checking out a few locks in the Kawarthas to test our luck with night fishing. We want to try minnows but should we bottom bounce or use a float. The water isn't that fast where we plan on trying. I will have a boat but night time is gonna be shore fishin..(Im sure i'll have a few beers)  Whats everyones go to lure for night time walleye?
471987,fish-miester,2010-06-02 20:52:00,864,honestly Im pretty simple.. jig head. or nuckle ball jig head.. with a bright mr.twister style grub.. its been workin for me at the lock just down the road from me..
472082,Paully,2010-06-03 01:29:00,712,not everyone at once now..  do you tip your jigs with worms or minnows?
472084,fish-miester,2010-06-03 01:35:00,864,"honestly no, but my friends do, and or with gulp leaches.. and if I am fishing during the day my go to lure is nuckle ball jig with a jumbo leach.."
472098,Paudash,2010-06-03 02:13:00,273,good quaility beer fishing at locks goes as follows Lawn chair 12 mimmows 3/8 oz egg sinker floating jig head  toss the line out as close but not in the edy as you can  drink beer until they show up and hope the rock bass don't eat all your minnows
472107,chris.brock,2010-06-03 02:48:00,4053,"I agree with Paudash, minnows are effective and good for beer drinking. If possible, lower straight down with a 3 way rig and a shiner, hope the rock bass don't hassle you too much We use to fish off a Kawartha dam, after dark, just this way"

472405,EC1,2010-06-04 01:19:00,930,"Especially for fishing walleyes at dams, minnows and waiting until your rod moves is a given, but if you want to have a bit more fun, I suggest jigheads and plastics - I usually use a 1/8oz (heavier as the water is more turbulent) with a gulp minnow - or a crankbait. The type of crankbait really depends on which dam you would like to fish.  Rapala Countdowns are always a safe bet because you can pretty much fish any depth, but I notice at dams you can even use a floating rapala as the fish are often willing to chase down your bait."
