470279,Slayingm,2010-05-27 19:46:00,204,Wow.... besides the amazing weather over the long weekend the fishing action was equally hot!!  I had folks out on the Severn River and Sparrow Lake on Sat and we got into a number of Pike and Walleye.  Sunday's trip on Rice Lake though was something else!!!  I have fished that lake including Walleye tournaments for many years and never experienced action like this before!  I had a father and son out for the day on Sunday who recently purchased property on the lake and wanted to get to know the lake better.  We headed out from a launch on the N. side of the lake at 8am and each of the 6 stops for the day produced Walleye.  In fact some of the GPS spots I have fished for years were so hot we had mutilple double headers of Walleye on and all on artificial baits.  We stopped fishing at approx. 3:30pm and had boated 50 Walleye's and lost others.  I have never seen the action so hot on this lake in 28 years fishing it.  We kept our limit of 4 fish each in the slot and had a blast.    The most productive pattern's were working deep weedine points on main lake weed flats.  Bucktail jigs and smoke and white grubs accounted for all the fish.  Beautiful day on the water with the amazing weather made the experience unforgetable. Attached a couple of pics of some of the fish in the slot kept for a great fish fry!       Take care and Good Fish'n.... Greg.
470280,Paully,2010-05-27 19:48:00,712,Nice going.. so much for walleyes being a night feeder.
470301,Joey,2010-05-27 20:44:00,9122,Your fishing skills never cease to amaze me.  I almost don't want to open your report  Good going.  Joey
470321,Big Cliff,2010-05-27 21:04:00,6899,"I have to say, you are a far better fisherman than I am. We fished Sturgeon Lake hard on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday and we tried everything we could think of. Shallow, deep, weeds, weed edges. Bucktails, grubs, spinners......... We managed to boat 5, 1 under the slot, 1 above the slot and 3 that were in the slot. I guess I'll just have to hire you as a guide to teach me some how and where to!  What would you charge for a day on Sturgeon lake? Might be a good investment for me."
470328,Dusky,2010-05-27 21:19:00,310,Man o man..  seems eyes just lub u...
470329,fish-miester,2010-05-27 21:27:00,864, Great Report! I would also be interested in going out on sturgeon
470330,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-27 21:45:00,0,"Great report! I had a similar experience with the pickerel! Smoke colored grubs and minnow baits did the trick for us, worked aggressively. They were on fire!"
470336,Big Cliff,2010-05-27 21:59:00,6899, What lake were you on?
470357,tb4me,2010-05-27 22:58:00,3295,what is the going rate for a guide on rice lake? We may be interested too! You can PM if you with to keep this info private
470390,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-28 01:02:00,0," Well a friend told me about this lake so cant really say. Anyways, I don't want to derail the thread, if you guys are interested in a pickerel guide? Greg Klatt(Slayingm) is the man for sure!"
470394,Terry,2010-05-28 01:27:00,14456,and that's why he posts here
470442,Garnet,2010-05-28 09:56:00,2056,I was out Sun and had the same action and know of 3 other lakes that were on fire. And Wed. and Thurs just ordinary 10 -12 walleye.
470449,Big Cliff,2010-05-28 11:11:00,6899, I have to say that is true loyality! Most of the guys I know would have given up the name of the lake. They might not tell you where on the lake or exactly what they were using. You deserve a lot of respect!
470581,Ron,2010-05-28 21:51:00,1683,"  Yup same here Garnet,  We put 48 walleye in the ourselves last Sunday. Still not one of my best days on the lake though.We were playing buck buck buck, that is why we were counting. I got the first, buddy got the biggest (24.5"") and I got the most (33)"
470583,Terry,2010-05-28 21:57:00,14456,so we should call Ron for guide service....
470600,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-28 22:42:00,0,Looking forward to Ron and Garnet's reports. Hopefully they are as detailed as Greg's. I will be posting mine soon. Have it written out but waiting for the pictures.
471385,Slayingm,2010-05-31 19:59:00,204," Hi Big Cliff, check out my website link below...  rates are reasonable $400- for a full day (1 or 2 person's fully inclusive! and  $75- for additional person's.

471769,Radnine,2010-06-02 01:43:00,1538,Some how this thread reminds me of the guys that only tell you about winning at the casino. The fact that I couldn't catch a cold on Rice lake in the last two weekends might have something to do with my bitterness (I also never win at the casino). Jim
471807,Sinker,2010-06-02 04:11:00,8692," Man, your doing something horribly wrong. I took two 8  year olds out on the weekend, and they had thier limit in about 2 hours. I didn't even put a line in the water, and that's not counting under slot fish.  Next time your in the area, get in touch.  S."
471826,Radnine,2010-06-02 10:59:00,1538," I know man! I think that I might be guilty of flogging a dead horse too much (going to the same spots that have produced in the past and not being willing to change). Or, I am just a tool. But I have had success in the past. The guys that I fished with last weekend were ""the guys"" more than fishermen, but there were twelve lines in the water and not much to show for it. On the long weekend however, I was with the B-in-L's and they can fish! We got some, but no where near limits (let alone in one day). That is the thing about fishing, I never know if it is just me, or if it the fish. Thanks for the offer Sinker. Let me ask you this: What methods were you/the kids using? Jim"
471953,Sinker,2010-06-02 18:45:00,8692,"With the kids we slow trolled worm harnesses. Its just easier for the kids. We only ran two rods, and the kids reeled all the fish in. When I go myself, I like to cast cranks, or jig them.  the key is deep main lake weed edges.  S."
