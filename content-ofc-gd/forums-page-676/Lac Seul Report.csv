471031,trapshooter,2010-05-30 19:15:00,1234,"Been super busy the last few weeks fishing, learning new water and doing some guiding.  Everything here on Lac Seul is 3 weeks ahead of normal with the early spring and warm temps.  The pollen from the Jack Pines has come and gone already, which usually happens mid-June.  Fishing has been good overall and I've covered a lot of area on this huge lake.  Here's a few pics from my adventures in the last little bit.  Bass.... another reason to love NW Ontario... they never close!        Walleye fishing has been fun too.        This one is the biggest so far for me this season, 28""    This next walleye I caught OOS while pike fishing with a huskey jerk... get this... it followed to the boat so I f8'd it and sure enough it came around and inhaled the bait.    Saw some big pike this spring too.. in fact the biggest I've ever laid eyes on was this 44.5"" my buddy Colin caught.    Makes my mid 30's fish look tiny!    Spent a day trolling for lakers and boated 19 fish but nothing over 5lbs.  Didn't even snap a picture.  So there's my update.  I'll be out a lot in June and before I know it, it'll be muskie season again."
