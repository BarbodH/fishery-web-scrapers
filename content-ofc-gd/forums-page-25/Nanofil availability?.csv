1066300,captpierre,2020-10-04 23:36:00,2521,Seems nobody has NanofilÂ Â in stock. Â Berkeley website still has it listed. Just sold out like a lot of other things? Tried the their X9 line instead but donâ€™t like it as much. Â Nanofil is my favourite spinning line.

I just put an order in to them, as there is no stock anywhere up here . My shipping was $15 for 8 items. If you are closer then I, you can pick up and save ship cost."
