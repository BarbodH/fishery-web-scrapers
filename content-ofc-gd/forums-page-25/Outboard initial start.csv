1066622,super dave,2020-10-16 21:59:00,323,Hey guys. Got another outboard question.   I picked up a 6hp Evinrude early 90s. It just won't initially start. If I give a little squirt of carb cleaner or starter fluid in the carb starts right up and stays running.  Idles perfect and revs great.    Then starting is no issue.  It's when I leave over night it won't start again.  Need to shoot a bit of fluid in the carb to get it going then no issues again.   Fuel pump is working. I took off the hose to the carb and it's pumping gas when it's running.   Any ideas?   I will clean the carbs but just weird how it runs great after it gets going.
1066623,Old Man,2020-10-16 22:25:00,822,Primer not working?  
1066624,super dave,2020-10-16 22:41:00,323,So I tried starting it with a long rope wrapped around the fly wheel and it worked.   My theory is the starter rope is too short. Does that make sense? I can see that the rope is too short to wind on all the thingy.  I attached a pic.   Fully extended the rope is 36 inches long.  Should it be longer?   I thought I read it should be 54 but my arms are not that long. 
1066625,super dave,2020-10-16 22:43:00,323,Primer bulb works.  I took off the gas line to the carb and it shoots gas when I pump it. I can smell gas after pulling with the choke on.  After it starts I can start it by just half pulling at a much slower speed.
1066626,Old Man,2020-10-16 22:48:00,822,Do you have a compression tester? 
1066627,super dave,2020-10-16 23:00:00,323,I do.    I should test that.  But it starts extremely easily after I get it going.  So starting again isn't an issue just first start. Thanks for your input old man.  If you have any other ideas I'm all ears.
1066629,DRIFTER_016,2020-10-17 01:48:00,10439,It could be a bit of a weak stator assembly and being able to get a more robust spin is helping to start the engine. I would replace the pull start rope with a longer one and see what happens. It could also be cracked or worn reeds too. This will show up in a compression test.
1066630,super dave,2020-10-17 01:50:00,323,Hey Dave. I'm assuming if it's reeds compression would be low?  There are no other symptoms of bad reeds.
1066632,DRIFTER_016,2020-10-17 01:59:00,10439,Correct. If the compression is low it makes it much harder to initially draw fuel into the cylinder. Wrapping the rope around the flywheel spins the motor over faster to help combat the issue. So I would change the rope and then do a compression test. That info will point you where to go next.
1066633,super dave,2020-10-17 02:18:00,323,Makes sense.   Thanks.
1066640,Garnet,2020-10-17 16:20:00,2056,Those 90's rude/Johnston where cranky initial starters. You need to trim down so motor is level. and then start. Think it's because carbs are at front making float bowl half full . After 1st start all good.
1066641,misfish,2020-10-17 16:26:00,29133,"Not to be rude,but I do not see the reason for a longer pull cord. Most engines I have had, you could do a short pull and they would fire up . Also,it looks like you are almost maxed out anyways."
1066660,super dave,2020-10-18 21:46:00,323,"Update.  Compression is low.  I'm getting around 70 psi in both cylinders.  I got some marvel mystery oil hoping it will free up the rings.   I can hear air escaping somewhere in the prop area to confirm the low compression.   Once I dump the oil in the cylinders, what position should I be resting the motor to allow it to soak?"
1066661,Old Man,2020-10-18 21:52:00,822,When you did the compression test did you pull it over at least five times with the throttle held wide open? Less than 5 pulls will not give an accurate reading on most 2 stroke motors. 
1066662,super dave,2020-10-18 22:13:00,323,Hmmm. Not with the throttle open. At least 5 yes.  I'll try again. Thanks all. This is my new covid  hobby.  Buying broken engines and trying to fix them.  If this is junk I can at least get rid of it for parts or I'm out 300 bucks. Not a big deal.  But would like to get it in good running shape.  I figure best way to learn small engines is to actually do the work.
1066663,Terry,2020-10-18 22:21:00,14456,If you can run it for 5 minutes then do the test
1066671,DanD,2020-10-19 11:00:00,2223,"Maybe before anything else try this. Drain the carb or let it run out of gas when you're done playing with it. Let the motor sit for whatever time it takes for it to become fussy starting. When you go to start it, pump the bulb to fill the carb with fresh fuel. Give it a pull and see how it starts. The small amount of fuel in the carb might be going stale? Yes I know that seems awfully fast for fuel to go stale; but it can and does happen; with very small amounts of gas; that is exposed to the atmosphere. If this doesn't help you're not out anything for trying? Dan."
1066673,super dave,2020-10-19 15:51:00,323,"Hi dan Thanks for the suggestion. I did do that with new gas and the issue was still there. I think it is a compression issue as Dave stated.  it doesn't have enough suction to pump up gas even with the choke on.   I was getting about 70 per cylinder and doing something to address that now. I noticed the flap that closes when the choke is on, has a few holes so I plugged up the carb vent with a shop towel and it started by the second pull. Appreciate all the input from everyone."
1066674,Old Man,2020-10-19 16:07:00,822,Cold Starting mixture is too lean. Check your carb settings.  
1066675,Old Man,2020-10-19 16:22:00,822,Here’s a link to rebuilding 1976 to 1992 Carbs for 6 hp OMC outboards. There are 3 video links in the article. The one on reassembling or the one on reinstalling should have carb setting information in it. https://www.boats.net/blog/johnson-6hp-outboard-carburetor-rebuild
1066691,super dave,2020-10-20 14:47:00,323,Thanks old man.  Was trying to figure out how to get the recoil off.  This helps a lot
1066724,super dave,2020-10-21 14:32:00,323,So did a marvel mystery oil treatment on the top cylinder and I'm getting about 112 psi in that cylinder now.  😁 Just put some in cylinder 2 and let's see how it goes.   Haven't started it up again so I'll update tomorrow.    Thanks for all the help from everyone. Hopefully this thread will come in handy for someone else.
1066727,Old Man,2020-10-21 15:48:00,822,Good to hear 👍🏻
