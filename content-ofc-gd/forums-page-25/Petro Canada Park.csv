I had never been so I wanted to see what the salmon run there was like and maybe have a couple casts. I arrived to 20 fishermen crowded around a small pool casting to the same couple of fish, guys in waders chasing around salmon in half inch water and tons of salmon with slit bellies rotting on the side of this tiny creek. Needless to say I will never go back. Where is the sport or fun in this though? It was disgusting."

1066348,Rizzo,2020-10-06 11:42:00,4754,wow. gross
1066354,mamona,2020-10-06 13:57:00,597,Credit and other tribs are the same. The only difference - every year there are more and more people.
1066359,DRIFTER_016,2020-10-06 15:22:00,10439,There was a reason I gave up on river salmon and didn't come out to fish until all the rubes left.

1066361,JonnyButts,2020-10-06 20:01:00,40,"I see this kinda stuff all the time. Salmon run brings out all kinds . Last night I had a spot to myself , just enjoying the evening. Iâ€™m retying and along come 3 guys in their early 20â€™sÂ , hop down and right into my spot. Bunch of carrying on , I lasted 20 mins before I got outta there. Sometimes I wish they required more for fishing than just a license, like maybe some Education and Etiquette on fishing . Iâ€™m looking forward to the cold weather, seems to weed out the riff raff of angling."
1066373,mamona,2020-10-07 14:45:00,597,Not a bad idea. Some countries require passing an exam to get the license.
1066440,Cando,2020-10-09 18:06:00,90,I use to go down to Erindale Park over 10 years ago and that was happening there. A lot of people complained andÂ the MRN would show up regularly to nab people. I don't know if they still go there or not. I remember BASS would go down and pick up the dead fish and the garbage lining the shoreline.

1066451,grimsbylander,2020-10-09 21:36:00,3016,"Wait, I thought early season catch and release for bass on the Great Lakes was the ultimate heinous crime? ðŸ˜‚"
