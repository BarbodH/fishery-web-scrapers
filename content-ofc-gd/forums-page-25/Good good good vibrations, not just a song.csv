First cast fish on, a sheephead of all things. Well at least I know I won't have the white stripe today. Second cast same area, pike on, nice size as well. A few more casts and nothing. Moved around using different lures, after a half hour, back to the earlier spot, and yep, put the Vibrax back on. Few casts later another pike. Nice I thought. Few more casts yet another pike. Feeling pretty good, that's for sure. Decided to change areas, and keep the vibrax on. One more fish to finish the day, an bass. All fish caught on the Vibrax, a first for me. T'was a good day on the water.     "

1066578,mamona,2020-10-15 14:05:00,597,This time of year/conditions could also add something to the Vibrax performance. You had a really good day on the water.
1066584,PUMP KNOWS,2020-10-15 15:36:00,937,I try to stock up on vibrax’s in size 3-6 whenever they go on sale.  They catch everything
