1064869,John,2020-08-14 13:20:00,2956,"We are considering trying a seasonal campground to park the trailer for a year or two. It must have decent fishing, prefer walleye, pike, bass and good access to larger lake systems. Prefer Kawarthas but would consider Haliburton and maybe Muskoka if it's Huntsville area. Any suggestions, recommendations? It seems as though it's a tough find these days. Thanks, John"
1064903,Hack_Fisherman,2020-08-14 23:53:00,720,There‚Äôs a park on the water in Huntsville (deer lake Rv)¬†and one in around Gloucester pool Severn area. The latter may be more permanent ‚Äútrotages‚Äù though.
1064915,John,2020-08-15 12:26:00,2956,"Yes I have been in touch with Deer Lake. I believe you can access Vernon and then of course Mary, Fairy etc etc.."

1066261,Rizzo,2020-10-03 02:42:00,4754,pigeon lake has scads of places...just not sure if they have openings. We have rented cottages at a place called Cadigans Camp on Pigeon just¬†south of Gannons Narrows...you could always call the owner John and see what he has
1066264,John,2020-10-03 12:49:00,2956,Thanks guys. I have exhausted everywhere in the Kawarthas. May have to look further afield.
1066266,lew,2020-10-03 13:23:00,12766,"Have you checked Elim Lodge on the east side Pigeon Lake John, I just looked at their website and it says they've got 3 sites available but I don't know how current it is. It's only a couple miles from Cody too LOL https://elimlodge.com/"
