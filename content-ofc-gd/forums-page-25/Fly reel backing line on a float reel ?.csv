1066124,misfish,2020-09-28 22:23:00,29133,"I know I should probly know this . Can I use the same backing line I use on my fly reel ,on a float reel ? I have lots of it right now. I just thought I might get away from buying new backing line for the new reel .  "
1066125,dave524,2020-09-28 23:18:00,4508,Cortland Micron Dacron in 30 lb was the go to fly line backing back in the day. edit : some guys are buying spools of kite string for float reel backing
1066127,Mr Greedydrift,2020-09-29 03:14:00,25,Floating fly line works well. It keeps everything light by not absorbing water. Also usedÂ black coated dacron. I think it was heavy duty ice fishing line. It was perfect backing for the float reel.
1066128,misfish,2020-09-29 09:36:00,29133,Will try this on by back up. Interesting . I need to re-spool 3 with new line this fall.
1066129,misfish,2020-09-29 09:38:00,29133,Off to the $ store
1066134,porkpie,2020-09-29 14:11:00,2521,Just buy some cheap Walmart 20lb line for $4 and away you go.
1066138,dave524,2020-09-29 15:31:00,4508,"Just be sure it is no stretch dacron line, they were getting it online in different colours, some were even neon and they would match it to the colour of their reels so it looks real purty through the ventilation holes. Stay away from any natural fibre that would hold water."
1066144,misfish,2020-09-29 19:33:00,29133,"Have read to stay away from that. It will not sit on the reel tight like dacron will and will lead the main line get clinched in it,s self. Yes,I seen that on the center pin anglers site. I like purdy, but the fish do not care. LOL "
1066145,porkpie,2020-09-29 19:53:00,2521,"Iâ€™ve done it as long as Iâ€™ve owned a float reel, which is a long time. Â Never had an issue. Â Careful what you read, a lot of the guys giving the advice these days have only had a bobber pole for a couple years. Â Anyhow, whatever floats your boat brother in the end it donâ€™t matter so long as the equipment operator is happy ðŸ˜ƒ"
1066148,misfish,2020-09-29 20:23:00,29133,"Just for that, I am going PURDY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
1066153,Mr Greedydrift,2020-09-29 21:13:00,25,Anything no stretch is better for backing. Mono if wound on tightly could bust the spokes in your reel from the pressure. Reels that don't have spokes would be ok? I don't know.
1066155,misfish,2020-09-29 21:42:00,29133,"Well purdy stuff ordered. Going neon blue backing with Sun Line hi vis tangerine main. ðŸ¤©  And to my other post about that hollow pencil lead. They had 1/8 and 3/16. Got 2 spools of each. I should be good for a couple of years with that stuff, unless my son goes through my stuff and finds it . LOL J/K, I will share with him."
1066229,Snidley,2020-10-02 01:15:00,620,"I'll share something I learned from Jos at Angling Outfitters re float fishing with a pin in cold weather. He uses, and sold me, a relatively inexpensive Rapala centerpin float reel. In the cold Jos covers hisÂ  RapalaÂ Â reel with black hockey tape. This he claims reduces the cold metal /finger contact freezing aspect of winter pinning substantially. I don't float fish much at all but in winter my approach is to use a baitcaster (I only winter floatfish the Niagara) with P-Line Hydro Float line. The line is coated so no water absorption and I can throw a baitcaster with gloves on."
1066236,misfish,2020-10-02 09:26:00,29133,I have this set up for those colder days as well .I have also seen guys with their backs of their pins taped up with hockey stick tape .
1066238,dave524,2020-10-02 10:03:00,4508,"30 years ago, when I fished the Niagara all winter , had stuff taped up with this to avoid hand to direct metal contactÂ  Â https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/drscholls-moleskin-plus-padding/6000016952930  edit : back to float reel backing , heard of guys getting thoseÂ thin adhesive backed cork sheets like they use on the back of coasters and precision cutting strips to build up an arbor on their reels , low weight and won't hold water. BTW my first float reel was a Grice and YoungÂ  back in the early 80's."
1066254,misfish,2020-10-02 20:42:00,29133,I believe Mike ( Solo ) does that . He had mentioned it on an old thread.Â Â  Cabelas had 100 yard 20 & 30 lb dacron backing in floro green cheap . I just did up one reel with it.
1066256,ketchenany,2020-10-03 01:49:00,3229,YOU have no clue on line? Come on you are the master. wine time Â I know.
1066403,Nycflyangler,2020-10-08 03:06:00,8,I use some no name brand gel spun polypropylene fishing line I got a few years back at Sports Authority for backing. It came in a variety of test weights. I used 60lb test.Â  Probably stronger than the fly line itself. The test didn't seem to affect the diameter from what I could see in the package. It was chartreuse yellow/green. $20 a spool. For like 250-300 yards. I used the whole spool on a large arbor reel and added practically nothing to it's diameter. Plenty of room for the line and leader on the spool. I nail knotted it to the fly line. Then soaked it in with cyanoacrylate adhesive.
