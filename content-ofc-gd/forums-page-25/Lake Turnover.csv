The fish have definitely transitioned a bit with it. Where I was throwing a crank right up shallow a couple of weeks ago was a dead zone this past weekend. They wanted nothing to do with moving baits, they wanted everything drop shotted and out into the edge back into 20 fow. Man once we found the fish again though it was a bloody gongshow. We caught 20 smallmouth in about an hour 1 to 4 lbs they were all sitting on the side of the same clump of rocks in the middle of the lake."
