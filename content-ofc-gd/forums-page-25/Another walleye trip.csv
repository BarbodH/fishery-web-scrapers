1065586,Lostchild,2020-09-08 00:14:00,153,"I headed back up to Algoma County to search out some more walleye. Did pretty good over a couple days. Trolling pretty much all flicker baits, almost all colors were working size 6 and 7, lures running 10ft apprx. deep, 100ft back, 12lb mono, 14ft to 20ft of water. All fish came off shoals and points that had deeper water adjacent to them.         "
1065589,smitty55,2020-09-08 02:20:00,928,"Right on, did you sit on any spots for the evening fish or was it all trolling? Great sunrise pic btw, got the lake level too. It would be a good print. Cheers"
1065591,Lostchild,2020-09-08 04:16:00,153,"I did strictly trolling there were other boats that sat on spots, they did pretty good also from a few of them I talked to. They said there were using leeches and catching lots of eater size. I found I was getting bigger fish suspended on the troll. Other boats were hitting some pretty good whitefish out in 35ft of water, i didn't try for them but maybe next trip. This lake is a fish factory. Thanks for the compliment on the pic, beautiful sunsets and sunrises up there this time of year. The corn full moon was awesome to see as well, I would have liked to have a good camera to take a picture of that."
1065593,Rizzo,2020-09-08 12:28:00,4754,"looks like a nice ""walleye chop"" on the water....that is a thing still isn't it?"
1065595,LeXXington,2020-09-08 13:49:00,1928,"lots of nice fish,"
1065596,mamona,2020-09-08 14:20:00,597,"Wow, that's a nice haul. I am assuming you released them all?"
1065597,OhioFisherman,2020-09-08 14:36:00,6623,"nice fish, great pics! what the heck is a flicker bait?"
1065608,Lostchild,2020-09-09 02:02:00,153,Yes it is! Lol  All of them were released to swim another day.  This is a Berkeys Flicker minnow 
1065610,Old Ironmaker,2020-09-09 03:22:00,8243,"As far as I know it is. Even an overcast Pic sky, is that a thing today too?"
1065613,gordy28,2020-09-09 13:01:00,638,Nice fish and thanks for sharing I love the flicker shads for walleye and it sounds like I need to invest in some Flicker Minnows as well! Cheers Andrew
1065614,wkrp,2020-09-09 14:27:00,656,Nice going.
1065615,Lostchild,2020-09-09 14:51:00,153,I did use the shade as well but for some reason they seemed to prefer the longer narrower baits. What kinda really dialed me in was the catch in the picture before...pretty close to matching the hatch as they say... 
1065622,Duker1,2020-09-09 19:09:00,1,Never been to Algoma Cty. On my bucket list.
1065625,Lostchild,2020-09-09 21:08:00,153,There are some awesome lakes and rivers up there. If you ever go and need info I would be happy to help you out.
1065752,Ralph Zettler,2020-09-14 15:03:00,10,Nice fish Went to Commanda lake 3 weeks ago did real well 1st 3 days had to work real hard for them last 2days  the pike were cooperating as well no hammer handles but the walleye were mostly cookie cutter with the odd one out of the slot size
