1066652,Rizzo,2020-10-17 23:52:00,4754,in the musky game...early fish is a bad thing. If I get a follow on one of the first 10 casts I might as well pack up and go home. Every time I connect a fish early the results are disastrous. Better hope that first one bites because you ain't gonna see squat the rest of the day
