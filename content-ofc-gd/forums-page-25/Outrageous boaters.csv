If there is illegal fishing going on contact the MNR hotline but to endanger people's lives because you feel you own the water or whatever is an asinine move! Sadly he'll probably get a fine and that's all! If you drove a vehicle recklessly through a bunch of people just hanging out, you would probably face some jail time! Hope that he gets prosecuted to the full extent of the law! Unfortunately, this type of incident is becoming more common place! Sober sane people do not do such things!"

1066420,Old Ironmaker,2020-10-08 18:49:00,8243,"As if revoking this duffuses boaters permit he will stop running a boat, like many idiots that have their drivers licenses suspended stop driving.  Until boating requires full liability insurance to operate a boat in Canada where insurance rates will increase when convicted of boating violations idiots like this will just keep on being idiots and the fines are just the price of entertainment, if they ever get caught and fined."

1066456,PUMP KNOWS,2020-10-10 02:06:00,937,I was told someone was doing this at the mouth of the credit this fall while guys were chucking for salmon from shore.  They would come close to shore and to tangle lines.  Some people got spooled
1066530,Snidley,2020-10-13 22:10:00,620,"I've seen a large charter boat running big planner boards amongst the kayakers, scullers, tinnies and myself in a Toon at the Credit estuary targeting salmon. It's the right move in deeper water away from the small, or tiny craft found at the mouth this time of year and the guy should know better, but he doesn't"
1066533,DRIFTER_016,2020-10-13 22:35:00,10439,That's almost as bad as the sail boaters setting up a race course in the middle of the pack area where all the charter and rec boats are fishing the staging salmon at Pt. Credit and then at the end just cutting the anchor lines from their buoy's to then get caught in down rigger cables.

Investigators were able to obtain video footage of the incident which showed the suspect driving a speed boat at a high rate of speed through a group of 25-30 small fishing vessels. Police say the suspect circled and drove between the fishing vessels several times almost causing them to capsize. The speed boat and suspect were identified by anonymous members of the public after local media outlets reported on the incident. 48 year old Randy Crossen of Cobourg, Ontario is charged with Dangerous operation.

Suddenly, out of the blue, a guy on jet ski showed up. And did exactly the same thing as the guy from the video. 	Thankfully he gave up after 2 or 3 rounds."

At worst the guy cant drive his stupid (compensation) large loud boat anymore because if he does hes going to end up in jail.  *edit* the video is also now getting international attention on other bass boat and fishing forums...someone is going to see the video and know where the boat is from at a minimum."
