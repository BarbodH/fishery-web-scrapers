1066082,PUMP KNOWS,2020-09-27 15:40:00,937,"I might be going tomorrow, I’ll update if I go"
1066086,Snidley,2020-09-27 16:28:00,620,Thanks that is much appreciated. By the way I'm told that the Whirlpool parking lot is now a pay for parking lot like the lot at the Glen so take some change or a credit card. The Glen parking is $10 so I'm betting that's the same at the Whirlpool.
1066087,misfish,2020-09-27 16:33:00,29133,"So if they are charging,are they putting money towards an escalator ? LOL"
1066089,grimsbylander,2020-09-27 16:46:00,3016,They only help you get down the stairs. 
1066090,Snidley,2020-09-27 16:59:00,620,"At this time of year you see guys heading up the path with a salmon and the you find the salmon half way up ,lol. It is a brutal hike."
1066091,misfish,2020-09-27 17:48:00,29133,"In the 80,s, I was doing it almost every weekend  when they were in thick. Loved it when the lakers came in. Was a blast to fish there . Never did I even think of bring up a fish."
1066095,dave524,2020-09-27 20:16:00,4508,"From what they are saying it is $1.50 an hour or you can get a season's pass at the machine for $15 at the Whirlpool, this is what is posted on the Niagara fishing forum"
1066097,bigugli,2020-09-28 00:42:00,6138,"From what I understand, they were trying to close the whirlpool trails. dropping trees across the paths, etc... back about 2 weeks past.  People were trying to put on a protest demonstration, but I believe that  fizzled."
1066101,Snidley,2020-09-28 08:15:00,620,I know earlier this spring they were cutting down trees to remedy some sort of tree disease. Or so they said. There is always the issue of people dying down there (I've seen 3 bodies myself) and perhaps they are looking to deal with the unfortunate death toll down there by making the whole beautiful place off limits. That would be a shame
1066126,bigugli,2020-09-29 00:16:00,6138,This was in response to this summer's outrageous numbers of rescues. 
1066178,PUMP KNOWS,2020-09-30 21:19:00,937,Didn’t end up making it down that way. When did they start charging for parking?
1066213,steellee,2020-10-01 22:27:00,21,Fished the pool today. First time this season. Water was surprisingly decent and fishable until mid afternoon when for no reason it was in trees and I got washed out. Parking is 2.50 per hr or 15.
1066226,Snidley,2020-10-02 01:01:00,620,Thanks steelee. Was the current going clockwise or counter clockwise for most of the time?
1066230,steellee,2020-10-02 01:20:00,21,Main current running clockwise.
1066231,Snidley,2020-10-02 01:21:00,620,Thanks again steelee.
