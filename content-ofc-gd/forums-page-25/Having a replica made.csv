1065486,LefroyFisherman,2020-09-04 13:34:00,602, Awesome fish Dave! Looks great!
1065494,LostAnotherOne,2020-09-04 15:43:00,956,If I could tell you who put together my grama's bass 40 years ago I would bud.¬† No replica here and still in mint condition. 
1065495,lew,2020-09-04 15:58:00,12766,"Another skin mount still in great shape that I had mounted way back in '74 Fish was 45"" and it cost me $125.25 to have it done. I hate the fact that I intentionally killed that musky but it was the 1st one I ever caught and sadly killing them back then was just the norm and I never killed another one. This mount now hangs at a buds fishing lodge up on Nippissing.  "
1065496,AKRISONER,2020-09-04 16:03:00,5558,did you catch it ice fishing? Whats the story about the pinned snowmobile.
1065497,lew,2020-09-04 16:13:00,12766,"Actually it was caught in August 1974 and that picture was a snowmobile I used to own, a 1984 SkiDoo ss25 but neither has anything to do with the other and I just needed a place to stick the SkiDoo picture LOL"
1065499,LostAnotherOne,2020-09-04 17:29:00,956,"Definitely back in the days it was different.¬† Nice that you donated your fish to a lodge.¬† Was thinking about donating my grama's bass somewhere, but would hate to donate somewhere and then they go out of business and the mount gets tossed.¬† Was planning on starting a thread one day to get some ideas on where to take it."

1065518,David Chong,2020-09-04 21:58:00,836,Almost 8 3/4 lbs.! My PB!
1065527,LostAnotherOne,2020-09-05 00:26:00,956,That wasn't caught in Ontario was it Dave?
1065528,David Chong,2020-09-05 00:28:00,836,Lake Simcoe!
1065529,LostAnotherOne,2020-09-05 00:45:00,956,"Wow and congrats.¬† You put your time into getting that one in no doubt.¬† Probably equilivant to landing a 60"" musky.¬† Hey if you caught that one a few years later we might of seen your name in the record books."
1065738,JoePa,2020-09-13 20:08:00,179,I had a replica made of a Quinte walleye I caught years ago - was fishing with my grandson Konrad on a cold November day - all day long there were snow squalls and boy was it cold - it is hanging on the wall of my den - whenever I look at it I am reminded of that fishing trip - I remember the launch was ice covered and some guy threw salt on it so we could get the boat out of the bay - on the way home 401 was blocked because trucks couldn't make the small hills - it snowed heavy all the way until we reached Syracuse NY - having that mount keeps this memory alive
1065739,LefroyFisherman,2020-09-13 20:14:00,602,"Sounds like a hell of a memory, I‚Äôm looking forward to having this memory for years and years. I can also see us doing some fly in fishing trips some places too at some point."
1065741,JoePa,2020-09-13 20:26:00,179,Oh I forgot to mention - it was a 13 pounder - we caught 3 that day - one was 11 lbs. and another was 11 1/2 lbs - we kept two of them to take home and show the family -
1065020,LefroyFisherman,2020-08-17 20:32:00,602,"I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for having a replica bass mount done, for the lunker bass my son just caught. I got a replica made for my own bass years ago but don't remember where I got it done. Barrie area."
1065023,cisco,2020-08-17 20:49:00,597,Advanced Taxidermy is well known.
1065032,misfish,2020-08-17 22:46:00,29133,https://www.facebook.com/Brains-Taxidermy-118291591698713/
1065035,akaShag,2020-08-17 23:42:00,2073,"They have an excellent reputation.¬† If I was going to have a replica made, it would be these folks that I would go to first."
1065048,DRIFTER_016,2020-08-18 04:11:00,10439,Another vote for Advanced. Got a couple of replicas I want them to do for me.
1065049,cisco,2020-08-18 09:17:00,597,Also important to keep in mind is that replica molds are from actual fish and can be 'adjusted' to fit the dimensions of the actual catch. Advanced would probably have the most different size molds to select from. Obviously they would like to chose the next size up rather than down to make the buyer happy. I have seen some pics of a fish that to me anyhoo looked¬†quite a bit smaller than the replica. Don't recall the artist though so I am not saying it was Advanced. But keep in mind the dimensions you provide should be size of the replica. Now there is no saying that the angler's measuring tape/ability may have been off a bit too......üòá
1065050,mitch seguin,2020-08-18 11:27:00,98,My replica mount from Advanced is 17 years old and looks like it could still swim away.
1065062,OhioFisherman,2020-08-18 14:24:00,6623,"I'm a geezer, I haven't had a fish mounted in 40 years, although I support the idea of replica mounts those are still pricey. You could probably get a picture blown up and put in a frame and take your son out and get him his own good quality rod and reel for the same price."
1065063,LefroyFisherman,2020-08-18 14:35:00,602,"Not a bad idea but I‚Äôd like a replica to go with the memories. They are pricey, but worth it I think."
1065064,LefroyFisherman,2020-08-18 14:37:00,602,Who would do such a thing as too exaggerate a tiny bit ¬†we wouldn‚Äôt be fisherman if we didn‚Äôt grow the fish a little lol
1065140,cisco,2020-08-20 20:39:00,597,Haha! OK but say your son's bass comes back bigger than yours even though you know¬†yours was a bigger fish. Keep a close eye on this one dad!üòú
1065143,Old Ironmaker,2020-08-21 01:51:00,8243,"Back in 1983 I had a Tiger Musky mounted. It looks new to this day. Maybe because it was always kept moist as I had it hanging in the kitchen for years. That and Mr. Martin of Hamilton did it. He was an award winning taxidermist. I hope he is alive and well, he would be in his 80's now.¬†It was¬†$450.00 to do it then, that's a good chunk of change even for today. I always felt terrible I mounted a Musky until a few¬†years back when I found out that Tiger Musky can not procreate. All those years of guilt for nothing. What does a good recreation cost today? I have more than a few personal bests that I have pics of and remember the dimensions to a T. The dimensions grow every year adjusted for inflation."
1065144,LefroyFisherman,2020-08-21 02:08:00,602,"The quotes I‚Äôve been getting are around¬†23 - 25¬†bucks per inch, then some more if you wanted it on a piece of wood or on driftwood. Little pricey."
1065145,Rizzo,2020-08-21 02:24:00,4754,"I caught a nice tiger about 10-12 years back, debated getting a replica and it was gonna be 1000 at that time...hard pass."
1065146,Rizzo,2020-08-21 02:25:00,4754,but I did stop in to Jeff Brain's shop (I think that was his name) up north of Barrie and some of his work looked really nice
1065163,Old Ironmaker,2020-08-22 19:36:00,8243,"I know I paid $450.00 in 83'. It is 40"", if my sciferin' is write that's $11.25 an inch. Sounds about write if a re creation is 25 bucks now. Hey Rizzo, if you want to start a heated discussion here or on¬†any other fishing forum say that you caught a Tiger Musky* in Lake Scugog NE of Oshawa Ontario. Addin' and subtragshin' is good but my spelen not so gould.¬† A tough language that English is, should and would is ""ould""¬†but good is ""ood"", why?¬†I remember a Japanese gent telling me that Chinese was easier to learn than English. Japanese and Chinese have zip in common he told me. Digress much JD? * Auto correct for Musky was Muslim here at one time. Doesn't look good when you type ""√è once killed a Musky."" and auto correct replaces Musky with Muslim. Not good to say the least."
1065164,misfish,2020-08-22 19:49:00,29133,Go for a walk along a river and get yer own wood. Get the fish and mount it yer self. It is not that hard to do. I did that for my mounts when I had them done. I do not have a single mount now. Gave them away. Even the big buck of my life is now hanging on my brothers wall. So I am told. LOL
1065166,OhioFisherman,2020-08-22 21:08:00,6623,"I had a 20 inch largemouth, a 20 inch smallmouth, a 28 walleye, and a 41 inch pike mounted, the cost for any of them would have paid for another week of cabin rental at Pointe Au Baril in those days and some cash left over. The pike wouldn't have swam away, kept it in the livewell which was too small for it so I could get back to camp to get a picture, all the others could have been released. Stopped keeping fish after that unless they were for a meal or weigh in, didn't even like to handle them too much."
1065206,Old Ironmaker,2020-08-24 20:25:00,8243,"We were C&R well before my American pals and relatives ever heard of it. early 80's. For the price of that Tiger mount I could have bought a winter beater car, or a few actually. It is the only mount I ever had done. It is almost 40 years old and looks new."
1065207,irishfield,2020-08-24 20:47:00,26272,"Yep Brain was $22.50/inch when I had him do the Daughter's 44.5"" pike that died on us on a back lake. God knows I tried for almost 2 hours to revive that fish, but it is what it is, a $1000 Christmas present.. lol Glad to see they're back up and running after the place burning down a few years back.

1065213,Old Ironmaker,2020-08-25 06:01:00,8243,Very nice mount Wayne. Looks alive let alone real.
1065477,David Chong,2020-09-04 01:06:00,836,"You won't be disappointed! All of my replicas are done by Shawn & James at Advanced, they're the best as far as I'm concerned! Here is the last one that I had done! "
1065485,AKRISONER,2020-09-04 13:29:00,5558,"jesus dave, guys talk a lot about smallmouth being Footballs...that thing looks like it ate a bloody beach ball. It had to have been 8?"
