1066111,OhioFisherman,2020-09-28 14:36:00,6623,"Did the bamboo pole myself as a kid, for spring crappie fishing a 12 - 16 foot long pole made it easy to drop bait right om their heads! First reel was a Langley bait caster on a True Temper steel rod, it cast well, but the drag sucked, it didn't have one except a thumb on the spool. https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Langley-Lure-Cast-330-Reel/184465599709?_trkparms=aid%3D1110006%26algo%3DHOMESPLICE.SIM%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D225085%26meid%3Da5af3318ea9743a6aff03f5e0bc55b67%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D2%26rkt%3D12%26mehot%3Dpf%26sd%3D313229209874%26itm%3D184465599709%26pmt%3D0%26noa%3D1%26pg%3D2047675%26algv%3DDefaultOrganic&_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851 Note the high tech vented spool!"

Inglis had a plant in Hamilton and True Temper had one in St Catharines, like to believe it was locally made. You won't find that today."

Dad tournament casted back around 1950, I inherited his wornouts for a while, think he went to a Langley when I got the Wonder Reel. He was pretty good, there was a 1st place trophy for 5/8 ounce bait and a fly accuracy 1st place¬† , won at the Toronto Anglers and Hunter's competition at the sportsman show.

We used to set the metal garbage pail lids out on the lawn and practice casting accuracy, by 12 I was pretty good. The lids gave a satisfying clang when you were on the mark.
