1065986,Rizzo,2020-09-24 00:40:00,4754,"As I slooowly get hooked on Lake Ontario and salmon/trout fishing, I find myself scouring kijiji and marketplace for a used downrigger. Am I nuts to even consider a manual downrigger? Or do some guys swear by the manual and say don't bother with electric? I have used electric on a buddy's boat a few times, never tried manual. Are the type that clamp on to the gunnel far too lightweight (ie only good for a 3 lb ball). Or are there clamp on varieties that would actually suffice? Lots going one here...clearly I am open to suggestions!"
1065994,John Bacon,2020-09-24 04:13:00,3277,I have always used manuals and I am fine with them.  They are not clamp ons though.
1065996,misfish,2020-09-24 09:24:00,29133,"Morning Rog If you are on fish, you are going to regret the manual. The Mag Scotty electric,s are sweet. Terry has them and they make the day much more enjoyable. I would stay away from clamp on riggers ."
1065999,fishindevil,2020-09-24 11:15:00,6254,go with electric it ups your game huge..... i spent 25yrs downrigging and trust me its well worth it....and i still have a ton of salmon gear and 2 big john captains pack riggers electric of course that i will be selling very soon as i live in kawarthas and do not salmon charter anymore
1066007,mitch seguin,2020-09-24 12:49:00,98,Budget determined that I use clamp on rigger.  I have used a Scotty 1080 for several years with 10 lb ball in combination with a dipsy rod as I fish solo from my tin boat.  I have not had any issues with that downrigger.
1066008,LeXXington,2020-09-24 13:20:00,1928,"I have both, Electric is the cats butt... yet manuals are smaller and lighter. If you plan on really doing the down rigging go electric. If cost and time spent are concerns manuals are just as good. one note if you plan on running heavy weights manuals will be a workout.   I use manuals on like Erie and when camping 5-8lb weights"
1066012,Hack_Fisherman,2020-09-24 16:18:00,720,"As a newbie to down rigging this year, I’ve already learned to hate manual Downriggers. I’m going electric as soon as I can afford it"
1066013,TJQ,2020-09-24 16:59:00,7806,"When I was fishing temagami alot I had manuals... If i could do it again, id get electric."
1066014,glen,2020-09-24 17:18:00,2641,I ran one electric and one manual.  For me the manual was good to 60’ deep.  Deeper and it got to be a lot of cranking.  So manual for shallow fishing
1066017,DRIFTER_016,2020-09-24 19:54:00,10439,I run manuals on my boat (Canon Easy Troll) but spent many years chartering on lake O and if I were getting electrics I would get Big Jon Captains Packs. They were always my favorite riggers to use.
1066026,porkpie,2020-09-24 23:23:00,2521,Electric all day.
1066028,Rizzo,2020-09-25 11:20:00,4754,"haha thanks...kinda figured electric would get the nod. Using them on my friends boat was pretty slick, you can get the line up and out of the way in no time while you are fighting the fish."
1066031,John Bacon,2020-09-25 12:36:00,3277,I don't have any trouble bringing a 16 lb Torpedo up from over a 100'.  But I am bigger than most guys.  	Electric would be nice so that I could get the weight up and out of the way while playing the fish.  But I think I spent about $250 on a pair of brand new manuals.  I wasn't prepared to spend the money for a pair of electrics.
1066049,LeXXington,2020-09-25 22:56:00,1928,Its when you just drop it too the 100' and set up them pop the clip that I hated
1066050,misfish,2020-09-25 23:11:00,29133,FAWKKKKKKKKK LOL
1066053,fishdawg,2020-09-26 00:35:00,912,Scotty 1116 Electrics no doubt...ideally 12-13lb balls are what most Lake O anglers should be using at a minimum to reduce blow back and have a good presentation.
1066055,BillM,2020-09-26 04:57:00,17367,Find some used Scottys.  1106 or 1116 (they're the same except for the dual rod holder).   Run some 12-15lb Sharks and you'll be golden for anything.
1066164,Canuck,2020-09-30 02:29:00,491,You can’t reel in a fish and raise a manual rigger at the same time. I fished Scotty manuals for 10 years and lost a lot of fish trying to do both. Walkers now. I wish they were Scotty electrics though. Walkers are fine but Scotty is nicer
