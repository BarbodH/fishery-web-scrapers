1040316,Old Ironmaker,2019-02-10 21:11:00,8243,Do you get HBO? It's must see TV for us. By the time I get off my butt and join the new world of TV technology it may be perfected. We now have enough bandwidth to support internet TV with the new modem. There seems to be too many to choose from. One guy says X is great and the next guy says no way brand Y is better. Buddy has a Kodi box and from what I see it sucks. I need to watch a NFL game while it is happening not 5 minutes after the play is over. Bell Sat. TV bill is killing us. 7 bucks plus HST for a movie rental. Probably $28.00 plus tax a month for movie rentals alone.
1040328,lookinforwalleye,2019-02-11 04:42:00,4399,"yes I get HBO and every network from coast to coast...every sports network you can think of...every news channel....every PPV event...every movie channel known to man...hundreds of 24/7 VOD channels to stream all the old classics, Bonanza... Hogans heros...Green Acres...All in the family...Sandford and son etc.etc.....I will see if I can get you some info, in the mean try this free option... ustv247.com   keep in mind with streaming you consume a lot of data....I stream movies,sports,tv shows and go through 500 gb minimum....unlimited internet is must and I would suggest at least a speed of 25 mbps.... And there is nothing wrong with Kodi....Kodi is just a media player, all streaming devices are not created equal there are good ones and there are bad ones and there is a learning curve but its not all that difficult....you do not need Kodi to use IPTV or stream movies/tv....and yes cable/sat/cell phone bills are crazy and that`s why I cut the cord several years ago!"

1021637,dave524,2018-01-23 11:32:00,4508,"No, but probably should. My wife got a couple of "" The Letters "" when she used to torrent a whole season of one of her shows from Pirate Bay or TorrentZ,  we been using Kodi to watch back episodes of stuff we missed when we had a life for 3 years now without a threatening letter. We tried going legal with Crave and Netflix but they are limited in what you can access compared to Kodi."
1021643,grimsbylander,2018-01-23 14:02:00,3016,"Same situation here. I work from home and connect remotely to our office servers by VPN, The thought of using another VPN connection kind of scares me! If it works, don't monkey with it! lol Kodi has been a pita the last year. It seems they start up an addon, run it for 3-6 months and shut it down, just to start another one."
1021646,KawarthaAngler,2018-01-23 14:16:00,273,"I have had a few media boxes over the years.  One of the boxes I currently have is an Amazon purchase of the Android kind (like an Android smart phone) and it has the Kodi App.  So it's more than just a Kodi box ... but I use Kodi the most because it is so good (I've been using it since its original creation years ago when it  was XBMC). Because my Android media box is pretty much like an Android phone, I can go to the App store and install Apps.  I have an annual subscription to Private Internet Access VPN.  I use that on my desktop computer.  On my Android media box I installed their App and typed in my credentials and BAM ... I have a private connection to one of their U.S. east coast servers.  That works to give me access to the U.S. only shows that can be accessed either through a Kodi plug-in/add-on .... or by installing an IPTV App in the App store.  Because I have a very poor rural DSL connection, I don't have the throughput for the VPN of TV shows to work.  They don't scale well to a slow connection.  I more=or-less installed the VPN and those Apps to see if they would work.  Too bad, because I could get stations I don't get on our Satellite subscription plus free-to-air sations.  Oh well. So I use the Kodi App to play video off my shared computers hard drive (works great for that) or the Netflix App (which scales great for my poor connection). Works well for the $60 I paid for it.  LINK -> http://amzn.to/2rsNHDe"
1021692,lookinforwalleye,2018-01-24 06:03:00,4399,The Kodi add-ons have taken a beating lately...a lot of the developers got scared when the letters started going around. Right now I primarily use the Terrarium TV APK for TV shows and Movies works very good and you can use a Debrid account with it. There is a new add-on called Cerebro which is a fork of Covenant and it looks promising and another one called Placenta ( god awful name) it works pretty well. As it stands now I use Terrarium about 75% of the time...For live hockey I use a paid service cost 20 bucks for the year including playoffs and I have access to every game!

Live TV can be hit or miss, at least for me.  I just updated my version of Kodi to the most recent 17.5. Then loaded one of the newest ""builds"" or even load specific programing individually. I just find the builds easier as all the content I would ever want has been gathered in one download. Some work better than others, so you may have to factory reset your box and reload to see what works better for you. Live TV can be spotty sometimes. After this newest update and programming, I'm seeing more quality streams in 720p and 1080p.  Some streaming requires extra downloads to make things work like ""fmtester"" or ""sportsdevil"". I assume these are like drivers for computer software. The newest ""builds"" seem to have everything piled in one download.  Enjoy!"

Plus they can forced to release any data they have on anyone's traffic.

It is my laptop for certain, it won't upload pics from the phone or camera now. That does seem rather strange. You could go into device manager to check the ports you are using. Right click on computer and hit properties. Then click on device manager. Go down to all your different ports and expand them. Double clicking on any of them will bring up an window that will show you if the device is working properly. I also wonder if you have probs with some of your system files. A system file check might be in order if you feel up to it. Hit the windows key and type in cmd. Up top you will see cmd.exe. Right click on that and then click on ""run as administrator"". A new small command window will show up. Type in sfc /scannow and hit enter. This will scan all your system files for errors and repair them if it can. When it's finished it will give you a message telling you what it found and what it did. Don't worry, you can't hurt anything with this command.  Cheers"

I guess what I was horribly trying to say was I can't even post a photo let alone do everything required to use Kodi. I imagine I can pay someone to set it up for me, sometimes you have to know your limitations and just pay that ""guy""."

I guess what I was horribly trying to say was I can't even post a photo let alone do everything required to use Kodi. I imagine I can pay someone to set it up for me, sometimes you have to know your limitations and just pay that ""guy"". I'm sure you'll manage with the PC stuff, if not let me know and I could walk you through it over the phone. As for the Kodi box I've never used one so I'm no help there.  Cheers"

A look on the Kodi Tips forum suggested everyone switch to the new one "" Neptune Rising"" so far so good,  if anyone else is having trouble I'd say give it a go. Kodi sure isn't a install once and forget it application , takes constant tinkering and updates to keep it current and working .  http://www.wirelesshack.org/how-to-install-neptune-rising-kodi-addon.html"
