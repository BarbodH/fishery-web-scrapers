I love reading trip reports and when available user reviews of resorts, lodges and products.  Trips aren't cheap and in some cases neither is gear and reading user generated opinions really helped our group take the plunge.  A big reason I started to blog was to pay it forward and ideally help others make their first trip or catch their first fish or buy a fishing kayak. With that in mind I wrote my first outfitter review (hopefully many more to come, health, wealth and wife allowing) I also tried my hand at a cabin walkthru of the Root Bay Outpost (forgive my camera work - first effort!)  - its embedded in the post https://www.northernjacks.com/post/outfitter-review-slate-falls-outposts  Cheers Andrew"
