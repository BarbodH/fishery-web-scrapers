1066267,Raycaster,2020-10-03 13:33:00,528,I have never stayed at the Provincial Park but with covid thought pitching a tent overnight might be a neat idea. Looking at bringing up boat for just 1 night. Probably a cold night but do able. Anyone done this? Any insight appreciated.

Should be nice and scenic now.  Honestly, Would go for two nights at Balsam.  Went for the first time this year and was amazing for fishing."

1066350,LeXXington,2020-10-06 13:29:00,1928,no issue camping even with snow.  Hint if you have moving blankets put them on the floor of the tent and under the tent fly.  They are insulated and will keep the moisture down and heat in. If you have a cot also helps keep you off the ground. Some parks are open till November but lots close this coming weekend.
