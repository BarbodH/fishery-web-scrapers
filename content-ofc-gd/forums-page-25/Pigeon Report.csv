1065466,tomkat,2020-09-03 21:13:00,246,Black perch believer has been my favourite colour. I don‚Äôt see them very often so I grabbed a spare a while back.
1065468,misfish,2020-09-03 22:01:00,29133,All are over thinking. Trolling worm harness for eyes works great.
1065471,David Chong,2020-09-04 00:31:00,836,Beautiful Muskies!
1065498,Hank Jr,2020-09-04 17:12:00,146,Nice Muskies thanks for the report
1065607,fishdawg,2020-09-09 01:45:00,912,Good stuff Roger Its been 8 years since I fished there Planning a trip back with my 13 year old son next year to get his 1st
1065901,DICKEYRIGS,2020-09-21 18:10:00,10,Gotta be there when they're biting ! My record is¬†14 in the boat in one day there ! 
1065913,Rizzo,2020-09-21 22:21:00,4754,for sure! Been skunked there...had great days there. Spend enough time on the water and you will experience both these things
1065308,Rizzo,2020-08-30 17:55:00,4754,"Well it has been a while since I posted a fishing report. The summer has seen short day trips to Lake Ontario as I try to figure out the salmon/trout thing. Although that has been a blast, my ""first love"" is still musky fishing. When our planned trip to Myrtle Beach got cancelled, the suggestion was made by family to head to Pigeon Lake. I was not going to argue with that decision!¬†Winds were big and the floating weeds were plenty. Thank goodness for rod holders that can get those tips down in the water. Since it was a family vacation, fishing was not the primary activity. However, the muskies were on and we¬† were able to catch a bunch over the course of the week. Each time I went, I took a few passengers along. Since they were all newbies, trolling was the way to go. Managed to get a few people onto their first (and second, third and fourth fish). One of the nicest fish came as I was out with my 2 oldest boys...a special moment!  "
1065309,misfish,2020-08-30 17:58:00,29133,"DANG Rog, you need a hair cut,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  That is a BEAUT there buddy. Well done."
1065311,lew,2020-08-30 18:33:00,12766,"Big fish Bud, way to go !!"
1065312,glen,2020-08-30 18:45:00,2641,Nice clean long fish. ¬†The water looks pretty calm. ¬†Now I want to go.
1065313,BillM,2020-08-30 21:13:00,17367,Clean looking fish!
1065315,LostAnotherOne,2020-08-30 21:50:00,956,Pigeon is my least productive lake in the Kawartha's.¬† Super jealous.¬† Well done
1065318,Rizzo,2020-08-30 22:10:00,4754,oh the water was not calm for most of the week! It was bumpy boat¬†ride most times we went out.¬†Luckily we did have the odd moment when the water layed down...then you could actually get the boat on plane to get to destination.
1065323,Pigeontroller,2020-08-31 00:42:00,2793,Nice one Rizzo! 
1065325,mamona,2020-08-31 14:19:00,597,"Musky monsters from Pigeon, impressive."
1065365,Rattletrap2,2020-09-01 15:11:00,1652,Awesome fish........and also nice to see a fishing report! Being with your boys with especially rewarding!
1065398,Rizzo,2020-09-02 12:16:00,4754,Yes they have been on board in the past for some typical Pigeon fish (38-40 inches) but to get a big slob for the first time was extra special. Other than their cousin's shadow blocking out part of the fish we got one of those epic photos too.
1065404,AKRISONER,2020-09-02 15:19:00,5558,those are some giants out of pigeon. my limited musky experience is primarily out of that lake and I know how special those fish are. Very well done.
1065414,tomkat,2020-09-02 19:12:00,246,Nice fish. Were you trolling spinnerbaits?
1065429,Rizzo,2020-09-03 13:24:00,4754,one of the big ones came trolling a spinnerbait the other big one was trolling a believer
1065431,Hack_Fisherman,2020-09-03 13:47:00,720,Congrats on those 2 beautiful muskies. I‚Äôm still dreaming of even one¬†like that...
1065434,LostAnotherOne,2020-09-03 14:16:00,956,I‚Äôm sure Pigeons gonna be busy this weekend after this report lol.
1065444,Rizzo,2020-09-03 16:22:00,4754,haha. We all know musky fishing....all those people will soon be discouraged and swear to never go back to Pigeon. Pretty sure I made that oath myself once a couple years back. 3 of us fished Pigeon for 2 days solid and went 0 for 1. That's the way it goes sometimes.
1065448,LostAnotherOne,2020-09-03 17:17:00,956,Every time I fish Pigeon I always watch the other person with me catch one. ¬†I know going in that I‚Äôm the net guy lol.
1065451,Rizzo,2020-09-03 17:31:00,4754,"based on your name...not sure I want you as a netman.üòÅ Have had too many partners¬†poking muskies in the face with the net. Thankfully, I don't usually take pictures anymore, so the boatside release is fine by me (as long as I have seen the fish and know it isn't a personal best!)"
1065454,tomkat,2020-09-03 17:41:00,246,Spinnerbaits and Believers have been my most productive lures in the Kawarthas. I think a big part of it is they both are fairly weedless.
1065455,AKRISONER,2020-09-03 17:45:00,5558,"this is why i havent fished pigeon in a few years, Im 5¬†for 5¬†on musky days there, even trolling with multiple people in the boat, ive never been skunked. Cant say the same for the people ive been with, and they are far better musky fishermen than me. My luck has to run dry at some point right? Thats part of the reason ive probably been skunked every single time I try for musky on G bay. Ive caught 1 mid 30's¬†fish in about 5 days of fishing now lol. Need to give it a run hard this fall though, its time for a real one."
1065460,lew,2020-09-03 18:34:00,12766,"Anytime I was going to troll, a Jailbird Believer was nearly always the 1st bait I clipped on and they're an excellent musky bait.."
1065461,LostAnotherOne,2020-09-03 18:53:00,956,That lure will now be in my tackle box soon.¬† Thanks Lew
1065462,lew,2020-09-03 19:16:00,12766,"You won't be sorry for adding it to your box, but try trolling it at different distances from your boat, even real close,¬†like 5' back of the transom and you may be very happy you did."
1065463,LostAnotherOne,2020-09-03 19:26:00,956,Will try that.¬† Any change from how I fish the Kawartha's will be beneficial.¬† I usually use big spinner baits and did well casting with them the last few years.¬† Not so much with the bucktails anymore.¬† Was looking for something I could troll deeper water with and hopefully that lure recommendation works.¬† Tried several different large cranks over the years but no success.
