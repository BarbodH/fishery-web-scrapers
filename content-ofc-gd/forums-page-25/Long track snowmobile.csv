1065320,Old Man,2020-08-30 23:22:00,822,2007 AC 570 FC Panther works great for me. 
1065322,Terry,2020-08-31 00:21:00,14456,Nice machine but I go by myself most of the time to I wanted something light and the long track 154”
1066441,Terry,2020-10-09 18:23:00,14456,And she’s home  and sorry with my luck there will be no snow this winter lol  
1066442,irishfield,2020-10-09 19:04:00,26272,"NICE.. but that seat... no ""buddy"" rides there!"
1066443,Terry,2020-10-09 19:28:00,14456,This thing is long. A person would fit behind me
1066444,Headhunter,2020-10-09 19:30:00,5703,"Just strap me to the back Wayne, not like I could see where we were going anyway! LOL HH"
1066446,Cosmos,2020-10-09 19:56:00,588,"Nice machine Terry, congrats! Brand new?"
1066448,Terry,2020-10-09 20:19:00,14456,Yup brand spanking new the last new skidoo tundra lt 550f sold in Ontario.
1066449,misfish,2020-10-09 20:21:00,29133,"Look at all that room for more sh, cr, I mean stuff. LOL Nice ride bud. "
1066453,irishfield,2020-10-10 00:24:00,26272,Especially if they were female...
1066461,grimsbylander,2020-10-10 23:35:00,3016,Very nice. I can sure see the attraction to the long track Tundra.
1066475,cisco,2020-10-11 15:29:00,597,Congrats on finding such a great machine! Only a matter of time before your tremendous imagination kicks in and some enhancements/'modifications'/additions happen re ice/snow be danged!
1066481,misfish,2020-10-11 17:31:00,29133,"When you fish after 10 am Wayne, there are no buddy riders. LOL"
1066528,Terry,2020-10-13 19:07:00,14456,This is a mock up of what I’m doing with a big box and auger on top of it and still room for two to sit  
1066529,LeXXington,2020-10-13 20:45:00,1928,"Very nice,"
1066531,Old Man,2020-10-13 22:12:00,822,"Make sure that auger is secure, or you might end up with a head ache. 😉😄"
1066532,Terry,2020-10-13 22:14:00,14456,Oh yeah I have a auger mount I will be using
1066535,cisco,2020-10-13 22:41:00,597,Nice design for flat land but my experience is uneven bumps like at pressure cracks and going off the lake can tip a ride over pretty easy. Once even cracked a rib rolling off after tipping going over a snowbank on a slight angle on a northern access road. Even ruts on the lake from freezing/thawing vehicles can cause tippy conditions. Is a tow sled out of the question? IMHO try going long and flat rather than high to keep a low center of gravity. Two story snowmobiles aren't that common maybe for the above reasons.
1066537,Terry,2020-10-13 23:12:00,14456,I hear what you are saying but for 10 years I had it sideways on a skidoo and never had a tipping problem so I think it will be fine. Time will tell 
1066540,irishfield,2020-10-14 01:29:00,26272,Trust me Cisco.. he's a master at carrying everything and the kitchen sink and always makes it home... but there was this one time at the gas station.. LOL  
1066541,Sinker,2020-10-14 01:29:00,8692,"Nice rig Terry. I'm looking for one too. Hard to find. That's a beauty! I wish yamaha still made 2 stroke fans. My 2000 venture 500 is awesome, and bullet proof!  S"
1064630,Terry,2020-08-04 16:28:00,14456,I am looking to buy a long track snowmobile for ice fishing. I want it light  and dependable in all weather. So should I get a550 fan or the 600 4 stroke    The fan can run with little snow  . They start easy and easy to work on. But they are louder.  And poor mileage  but dependable as they get 4 stroke not as loud great on gas.  but the heat exchanger needs lots of snow to keep cool so what would you buy if you were about to buy one.    Oh yeah skidoo 2021 tundras no longer have the 550 fan motor
1064635,Fisherman,2020-08-04 20:15:00,7201,"Well just a humble opinion, I would try and get a 550 Fan,  the way our winters are going, every year less and less snow.  If you're only using it on the ice, a good set or maybe double them up ice scratchers might do the trick with a 4 stroke liquid."
1064638,Terry,2020-08-04 20:38:00,14456,That’s was my thinking for the 550f . We just can’t depend on snow and cold weather thanks
1064639,LeXXington,2020-08-04 20:51:00,1928,Is this the death of the yamadoo
1064640,Terry,2020-08-04 20:55:00,14456,Yamadoo is sold.  	but UTVadoo May make an appearance but I had a lot of last winter I could not run the atv on simcoe but a skidoo could run the lake
1064642,irishfield,2020-08-04 21:15:00,26272,They always come around Paul ! You'll be next.. LMAO !
1064643,LeXXington,2020-08-04 21:52:00,1928,let me know when your selling yours 😁
1064646,irishfield,2020-08-04 22:50:00,26272,LOL.. I'll never give up my '98 x 500 Touring Fan and now that Leah seems to love that 75mph '95 Polaris Indy Trail 500 I bought here I think you'll have to use the buy and sell !
1064647,ecmilley,2020-08-04 22:59:00,2163,4 stroke more.reliable and much better than a 550 fan motor resale higher as well. As for cooling i have one the harder to keep cool 4 strokes and with the addition of lots of studs can run pretty much bare lake with no overheating of engine or sliders. Regardless of engine you need snow to lube slider rails also other tricks to get ice cystals spraying such as scratchers or putting a single stud through rear of a ski
1064648,Terry,2020-08-04 23:03:00,14456,Yeah I have always used scratchers and I have used a bolt through the back of the ski too I have also had a flying stud  Poke a hole in a heat exchanger
1064651,DRIFTER_016,2020-08-05 01:15:00,10439,Had a rock do that on my big Yamaha 4 stroke. Replacing the heat exchanger was not a fun job. Book calls for 16 hours of labour to replace it. I took my time over the summer. Had to almost completely disassemble the dang thing. The only other issue I've had with my sled is the battery croaked this past winter. You would figure they would last longer then 12 years. 🙄
1064669,ecmilley,2020-08-05 20:31:00,2163,Me too! I welded it back up filled and bleed system been good since 2009
1064684,porkpie,2020-08-06 00:27:00,2521,"I don’t know, I really like fans And normally I’d say fan all day, but I run a 97 Polaris touring 500 liquid, with studded track and it’s able to run in most conditions without overheating. Got it cheap from my father in law and it’s been pretty good.  Hard to say."
1064751,BillM,2020-08-09 21:47:00,17367,"I'd never buy another Polaris 550 fan again.   Glad I got rid of it.   Now a 500 fan on the other hand, absolutely."
1064752,Terry,2020-08-09 22:11:00,14456,"There are no new 2020 tundra  long tracks in Ontario. There are some in Quebec ,so it that or buy used"
1064753,Fisherman,2020-08-09 23:08:00,7201,"I suppose you being the Mcguyver type,   you could put a rad relocate on the outside of the hood, no worry about studs poking the heat exchanger.  Only scratchers to lube the sliders."
1064803,cisco,2020-08-12 20:56:00,597,"Since you're retired and pretty smart about vehicles why not get what I have. Old Skidoo Safari. 503 2 stroke with long and wide track. Circa 1984? Folks don't know about em but mine has pulled out stuck ATVs, big huts and didn't take much to replace all fuel lines and rubber intakes/exhaust 'manifolds'. Hey and when you park it nobody will want to steal it like the great equipment you got robbed of a while ago. You may even find some coins dropped onto the dash from pitying passer by's."
1064808,Terry,2020-08-12 22:07:00,14456,not a bad idea  	If I got one with boggies instead of sliders then you need no snow at all I am only handy because I’m breaking stuff all the time.   I was hoping to take a break from fixing things by buy buying new lol
1064809,misfish,2020-08-12 22:43:00,29133,
1064821,DanD,2020-08-13 11:17:00,2223,"I would still have mine, if they didn't steal it and my Avalanche that the sled was sitting in.  Same thing for me last year. I didn't dare take the Suzuki out on Simcoe. I ended up going to Nipissing; so I could try Sally out on the ice. "
1065294,Terry,2020-08-29 20:17:00,14456,Well I found a tundra long track 550 fan cooled so I’m good to go.
1065295,misfish,2020-08-29 20:21:00,29133,Come with pontoons did it ? LOL   Nice buddy. You still wont be out earlier then me though.LOL
1065296,Terry,2020-08-29 20:29:00,14456,My snowdog floats 
1065304,misfish,2020-08-30 15:37:00,29133,"It should with 25 PFD,s attached to it."
1065307,Terry,2020-08-30 17:15:00,14456,Just 2 and a couple of pool noodles
