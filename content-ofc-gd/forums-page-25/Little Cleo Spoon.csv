1065790,PUMP KNOWS,2020-09-15 15:09:00,937,I went to Gagnons on the weekend and they didn’t have the spoon I was looking for but found this.  I wonder how old this is?    
1065628,PUMP KNOWS,2020-09-10 00:51:00,937,Has anyone seen this little cleo in stores lately in 3/4?  I can’t find this colour anywhere in the GTA.  I had a lady in a kayak run over my line and unclipped my spoon off of my snap swivel.   
1065629,ketchenany,2020-09-10 00:55:00,3229,i have a blue from years back! Never seen green! She killed it?

1065631,PUMP KNOWS,2020-09-10 01:37:00,937,Yup
1065632,PUMP KNOWS,2020-09-10 01:38:00,937,I don’t think they’re stocking this colour at my local fishing stores
1065633,Old Ironmaker,2020-09-10 04:31:00,8243,"I haven't seen any for sale but I have the exact spoon in my weapons of mass distraction. It's an antique in my books.  I have a few Cleo's that haven't gotten wet in over 35 years. I must use them again, they cast like rockets."
1065635,misfish,2020-09-10 09:54:00,29133,What size is that pump ? You could buy any of the colours and just nail polish the green on.
1065637,mitch seguin,2020-09-10 11:17:00,98,I am down to my last one.  I need to hunt down a source as well.
1065638,dave524,2020-09-10 12:30:00,4508,The ones with the Hula dancer on the back work the best 😁
1065640,PUMP KNOWS,2020-09-10 13:47:00,937,Get out there and start casting those bad boys 3/4.  I thought about that but that’ll be the last resort.  I also even tried looking online for cleo blanks but haven’t had any luck finding anything similar to a cleo  I think I only have 2 left  I only have 1 hula dancer left
1065642,OhioFisherman,2020-09-10 14:58:00,6623,"https://naturalsports.ca/products/acme-little-cleo-casting-spoon?variant=23360987955258 http://hooklineandsinker.ca/acme-cleo/  No idea on what is local for you pump, i wonder how much of an affect this covid deal has had on lure mfgs? Some brands may disappear?"
1065646,Headhunter,2020-09-10 16:28:00,5703,"Just came home from a trip to CTC in Pickering. They had a number of Cleo's in stock, various sizes and colours. I didn't see your particular lure, but it might be worth a look at a local CTC to you OP. HH"
1065647,fishindevil,2020-09-10 17:42:00,6254,check the ones made by lucky strike...they work well too and they are in peterbourough
1065651,grimsbylander,2020-09-10 17:55:00,3016,How many do you want?  
1065675,pics,2020-09-11 12:43:00,1268,I retired my topless hula girl Cleos.. collectors items..😜😎
1065680,PUMP KNOWS,2020-09-11 14:43:00,937,Thanks.  I called natural sports but they don’t have it in stock even tho it’s says it was available on their website.  They just updated it.   Whats CTC?  I haven’t tried them yet but my buddy has caught salmon with their glow spoons before.  I find their glow ain’t the brightest and the 3/4 size feels a little bit light for 3/4   Worst case scenario I’ll be paint my own spoons for next fall I wish I owned more but I’m down to only 1
1065682,Old Ironmaker,2020-09-11 15:58:00,8243,"I have always painted hardware my favorite colours. Some lure colours have been discontinued for some reason. Go to Michaels and get almost any colour paint in a small jar or spray can and all sorts of glitter spray on. I like Michael because I can get smaller cans and jars of paint. Then I will seal them in urethane spray on.  A warning, I have taken the 2 plus hour return trip to our closest Michael and found the a can won't spray. I asked a store clerk if they had a piece of something I could try the spray on in the back room and I got a terse Hell No. I go out in the parking lot and try each can on a piece of paper I have in the truck. I brought the bad can in for exchange. Miraculously they have a large piece of cardboard in the warehouse to do exactly as I asked to do."
1065686,PUMP KNOWS,2020-09-11 16:16:00,937,thanks!  I’ll give them a try
1065690,Headhunter,2020-09-11 16:56:00,5703,Canadian Tire! HH
1065691,Fang,2020-09-11 20:20:00,1330,"Best line up around me is Sail, can't say exactly what they had Although my last buys were the clone spoon from Bass pro - Cabelas Fishermen series The Cabelas ones certainly worked for me this year on Niagara area Lakers and spring time casting for steelhead. They have that exact color I really like the wonderbread and metallic colors, Purple-Blue was good"
1065694,pics,2020-09-12 11:46:00,1268,I would try Canadian tire.. the last time I was in Sail the shelves were pretty bare.. they can't get any stock in..
1065733,misfish,2020-09-13 16:38:00,29133,No one has stock. Cabelas here has zero trout hooks. Time for Canada to start making a lot of things. Time to stop relying on other countries .
1065734,Dutch01,2020-09-13 17:25:00,1431,"I saw someone post on FB this morning that they picked up the silver/chartreuse little Cleo at Grimsby Tackle, maybe give them a ring."
1065735,Dutch01,2020-09-13 17:26:00,1431,... 
1065764,PUMP KNOWS,2020-09-14 22:17:00,937,That one in the pic is glow chartreuse l and not silver/chartreuse.  I’ll give them a call tomorrow to confirm. thanks
