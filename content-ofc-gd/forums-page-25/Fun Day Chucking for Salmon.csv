1066379,PUMP KNOWS,2020-10-07 16:56:00,937,Rapala J13 in Firetiger was the Hot lure of the day.    I made sure I stocked up when they went on sale  
1066381,mitch seguin,2020-10-07 17:13:00,98,My go to lure for those fish.  Such a great deal for those J-13 as well.
1066383,BillM,2020-10-07 17:31:00,17367,That lure has been a salmon killer for ever.  Love trolling those in close about 5ft down on the rigger and 50ft back or so for stagers.
1066395,Rizzo,2020-10-07 23:36:00,4754,for a guy getting into the salmon game...good to know. Better pick one up next year unless someone has cleared them all out!
1066454,Hack_Fisherman,2020-10-10 01:14:00,720,Very cool vid. I’d love to catch me a salmon. Would you mind sharing the location of the tackle shop and do they have any left?
1066455,PUMP KNOWS,2020-10-10 02:02:00,937,A few weeks before that they had them for $6.99.  I managed to grab 19 at the time and gave a few to my fishing buddies I find these aren’t made with balsa anymore.  When I look at the joint it’s plastic compared to my older j13s that were balsa I stocked up twice when I had the chance.  I was told they received 200 units This shop is in Oshawa called Gagnons.  Give them a call first if they still have them in stock

Even a new fly fisher got some of my single egg flys . Karma comes to those that believe .👍 I have a few of those and yes,plastic. . The long lip ones work great for hot shot. Any fire tiger pattern seems to work up here. Even the bagleys."
