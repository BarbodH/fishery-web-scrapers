Reports i see from Simcoe say the same thing, the fish are up reasonably shallow, stacked up and feeding like absolute crazy. I had one of the best days on the water in my life on Thursday. The sunny calmer weather vs that weird crazy windy weather weve been having seems to be like a light switch. Get out there and have some fun if you can! "
