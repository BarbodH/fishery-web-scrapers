Nothing crazy size wise but it was nice to finally get into some brookies after watching countless youtube videos, and doing tons of reading. This lake was about 40 mins off the main road and has been stocked regularly for probably the  past decade. All fish were caught on small bright colored jerkbaits, it was a riot. Heres some pics those are a few of em, also lost a real nice on that was super coloured up with the nice red belly. One problem we were having was the fish were really tail nipping the jerkbaits and our hook up/landed fish ratio was terrible. Probably less than 50%, dull-ish hooks most likely being the culprit but the way these fish roll when you hook em they seem to be very good at throwing hooks. Also one thing that surprised me was how acrobatic some of these fish were jumping 4 feet out of the water. Is this characteristic of brookies? Never seen this in any videos ive watched lol. Lastly all fish were caught tight to shore near fallen timber or boulders."

1065895,TJQ,2020-09-21 15:28:00,7806,Beauties!!
1065896,Terry,2020-09-21 15:37:00,14456,Real nice
1065898,bassmaster4,2020-09-21 15:54:00,801,"Yeah we tried #2 mepps, had no success. The jerkbaits casted far better and we were able to launch them into where we were getting hit and stay a good distance away so maybe that had something to do with it, a lot of fish came on the first couple of twitches of the jerk bait. I was surprised couldnt get em on a spinner. I’m sure we would have if we stuck with it long enough but it didnt seem necessary."

1065910,PUMP KNOWS,2020-09-21 22:01:00,937,Those are perfect eating size.  Did you keep any for the pan?
1065914,bassmaster4,2020-09-21 22:23:00,801,"No, it was my first time ever getting any decent ones so they all went back, not much of a trout/salmon fan and i assumed it would be a similar taste so i let em all back."
