1065763,OhioFisherman,2020-09-14 22:14:00,6623,Do you mean like these Brian? https://www.jannsnetcraft.com/fishing-sinkers/345490.aspx
1065768,misfish,2020-09-14 22:45:00,29133,"Maybe Paul. I have not seen them, but he knows of them. They save on adding lots of shot and a streamer then the eggs shape ones.  Thanks  Now to find a retailer from the Geen to the Ganny to Niagara. Kid fishes every where."
1065770,OhioFisherman,2020-09-14 23:09:00,6623,"Those are like a texas rig worm weight, just no taper to them, I do think the tapered ones hang up more."
1065772,grimsbylander,2020-09-14 23:28:00,3016,Call Peter's Tackle in St. Catharines. They cater to the trout/river crowd and there's not much they don't have.

1065775,DRIFTER_016,2020-09-15 01:23:00,10439,I use the rolls of hollow lead for that kind of fishing under a float. http://www.fishermans-marine.com/oregon-tackle-pencil-lead-wire.html And use a rubber dropper like on the left of this image when bottom bouncing.  
1065778,misfish,2020-09-15 09:40:00,29133,He hits Peters store every time he goes down.  Thanks Pump

1065911,misfish,2020-09-21 22:06:00,29133,"Well I found some on line local , also found a spool of it at Cabelas on Saturday. They had 1 spool of small. I used my old wire stripper ( largest hole ) to score the lead . Works perfect. Read how guys use dog nail clippers.¬† Split the roll with my son . I want to try this as well. I think it,s going to much easier then putting on split shot. I also have access to a small scale to cut them in different gram sizes."
1065982,misfish,2020-09-23 22:03:00,29133,"Well I got to use the scale today. 2"" piece of lead was 8 grams. So now I can do the math easy, to accommodate my float and bait. Funny how fast that roll got cut up. Need more, as I gave my son more then half it seems. üòÅ"
