1066435,DanD,2020-10-09 06:37:00,2223,Nice pictures Lew BUT!!!!! 	And Im sorry;Â forget the leaves and all the colours. I love your garage/shop!! LOL Closer I get to retirement and leaving my (work) shop. The more Iâ€™m afraid of not having a shop to go and play in.Â  	You must feel proud of being able to walk out your door and see/ feel the things youâ€™ve worked for.Â  	Gil.Â  	Postcard picture of what ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦Â is all about! Dan
