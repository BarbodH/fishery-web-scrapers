1066295,Ticket_Terry,2020-10-04 20:26:00,2,"Been a while since I've been on the water, but was thinking of going out on Pigeon Lake for the day with a couple friends (they don't fish very often) Looking for a couple decent spots just to catch a few Bass.  Maybe a spot or 2 to cast for Muskies. Looks like an ok day weather wise with 11km winds. Renting a boat from Buckeye Rentals so was thinking around the Big Island. Any advice would be greatly appreicated! Thanks Terry  "
1066299,captpierre,2020-10-04 23:28:00,2521,"If you have maps or GPS find a hump, anchor in 15-20 ft around the hump and drop shot a minnow, worm or scented plastic.  Will catch in this order: bluegills, smallies, walleye and even Muskie.  If no action move 20 metres or try another hump.   Good luck"
1066302,Ticket_Terry,2020-10-05 00:08:00,2,Thanks Captain!  Will give that a try!!
1066306,Rizzo,2020-10-05 11:34:00,4754,"can't go wrong around big island...I don't fish the other species you said but musky can certainly be found almost anywhere around the island. Let us know how did. I wonder if Buckeye rentals is the same older lady who ran the Buckeye Motel...Joyce...hope she is still alive! She had a few years on her when I used to rent rooms there, and that was a little bit ago!"
1066309,AKRISONER,2020-10-05 13:26:00,5558,"this time of year, for smallmouth definitely find a shoal and park on it and cast out a drop shotted minnow pattern. Youll catch a bunch of smallmouth. For musky fish nogies creek."
1066331,Beans,2020-10-05 19:22:00,3339,My boys have had good luck at the bottom of Big Island in close to the bullrushes... I myself like to fish points like Hurricane Point where they extend out into the lake (watch your motor...most are not marked)
1066337,LostAnotherOne,2020-10-05 20:50:00,956,Bottom left side of Big Island.  Saw a couple get caught there this year.
1066380,Lucky Eddy,2020-10-07 17:12:00,10,"I had a trailer at Gypsie Point for twenty years and always fished Bottom's Island,Red Rock at North end of Boyd Island,Gordon Rock, Taits Bay, Hurricane Pt., Dropping Springs,  Steamboat, Dead Horse Shoals, and farther to the South is Three Sisters Islands, all good for walleye and muskie fishing. There was a map called The Old Guide's Map sold in Buckeye tackle shop, it was very informative. John Eddy"
1066463,captpierre,2020-10-11 01:23:00,2521,So Terry how did you make out?
1066471,Rizzo,2020-10-11 12:27:00,4754,"yes I have been wondering how it went. I have a buddy up there currently, they got one musky yesterday in a few hours fishing"
