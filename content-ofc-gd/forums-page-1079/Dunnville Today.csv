163653,FISHINGNUT,2008-02-24 01:17:00,253,Well got a call around 9pm Friday night  from my buddy who wanted to head down to fishmasters walleye tourney .Thought for about 2 seconds great idea.So I rushed around got packed and was in bed around 11pm.Picked my buddy up at 4am Saturday morning and we were on our way.Wow what a turn out I am sure Steve will post the results and numbers but there had to be over 100 guys out there .Great weather but a little bright for the eyes .Landed one eye and lost three at the hole one in the 7-8 lbs range  Chris got the big skunkaroo he had a few hits but that was it.Great day out nice weather and a little bit of fish action.  Me after losing my third fish of the day it was either laugh or jam the rod down the hole     We were sitting on about 4.0 inchs of ice I prefer more but no problems     Supper
