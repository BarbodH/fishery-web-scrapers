I do quite a bit of fishing on beford lake, colpoys bay, cooks bay and spots around the niagara region fishing mostly for bass, pickerel, pike, perch and some trout.  I have a cottage in the wiarton area and I have never iced fished up there.  Curious as to if any one has ice fished on colpoys bay or know of any other good ice fishing spots close by.  I look forward to any feedback.  Thanks  Sunny"

Also the small inland lakes in the area don't see a lot of pressure in the winter but can be a lot of fun. Isaac lake, boat lake, sky lake and Chesley lake just to name a few. Chesley does see more ice fisherman then the others do."

163555,rowingsunny,2008-02-23 21:22:00,11,"LOL, that's funny the gentleman who runs the bait shack up there gave the same advice when I called him to ask him how the ice was.  Have you had much success ice fishing on colpoys??  I have caught some pretty nice rainbows in the summer there."
163557,Spiel,2008-02-23 21:28:00,9065,....I've actually spent more time ice fishing Owen Sound just because it's closer but yes I've had success on Colpoys for whities.
