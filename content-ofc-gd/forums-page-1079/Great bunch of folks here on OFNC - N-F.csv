164160,Crazyhook,2008-02-25 03:59:00,1154,Wayne  my thoughts are with your family! you are all strong!
164164,irishfield,2008-02-25 04:04:00,26272,"Thanks everyone... it helps she had a great surgeon, that even visited her today, on a Sunday with 6 interns in tow. Jen was told that She( the surgeon) removed 65 cm (2+ feet) of intestine and joined it back together leaving her with 385cm of upper intestine. The removed section was sent for biopsy and nothing found other than the Crohns disease. No cancer, etc."
164230,ehg,2008-02-25 13:59:00,2666,"Sounds like a strong recovery is on the way. Your daughter seems like a real trooper. Gives you a chance to continue being a proud yet more relaxed father. Great news, ehg"
164237,Headhunter,2008-02-25 14:10:00,5703,Awesome Wayne and Leah! Great news she's home and will be receiving the extra she needs for a full recovery. All the best to your entire family! 'HH

163363,irishfield,2008-02-23 02:13:00,26272,"Well Kelvin.. I've got the sled & cutter on the trailer... stole the battery out of our emergency lights for the fish finder. I'll be there... if I wake up. I've got one day, maybe two of freedom before the gals come home."
163371,bassmastermike,2008-02-23 02:26:00,295,Well i guess i missed that thread as well bet it is good to hear that your daughter is back on track. All the best to her for a speedy recovery and to you to Wayne & Leah  for holding out well times were rough. Hope to see you at the Fishing for Tyler event tomorrow Cheers Mike
163374,Loonietoon,2008-02-23 02:27:00,1450,See you there Wayne
163378,OhioFisherman,2008-02-23 02:41:00,6623,"Get well Jennifer! Glad to hear things went well Wayne! er, nice outfit. I agree on the doctor deal, I grew up thinking the doctors were always right. My illness changed my opinion of that, you have to be your own advocate. Some doctors seem to think slapping a label on an illness is the same as a proper diagnosis.  Again the best to you and the family!"
163399,fishindevil,2008-02-23 03:38:00,6254,"Glad the suregery went well,and i wish jennifer a speedy recovery !!!! she will feel good as new in no time"

163406,bassboy,2008-02-23 04:07:00,161,"Wow....she has been through a lot!! Glad they were able to get all of it and that hopefully now she will be free of it forever, as you said Wayne.  Wishing her a speedy recovery and I hope all goes well.   Bill"

163490,taper,2008-02-23 16:51:00,611,Wayne glad to hear your daughter is doing well. Oh and by the way I love her choice of sport team attire.
163577,lunkerbasshunter,2008-02-23 22:35:00,2585,good to hear she is ok. Hope she has a speedy recovery!  Cheers!
163608,Garyv,2008-02-23 23:29:00,547,Don't know where I've been but I first noticed this today.  Glad everything went OK.  Having had a section of my intestine removed last April just make sure and keep watching for any infection.  There is a lot of bacteria involved in this type of surgery and infection is somewhat common.  Shes a lot younger that I am so her recovery should be minimal if she follows her surgeons orders.
163625,irishfield,2008-02-24 00:16:00,26272,"THANKS everyone... she got her IV taken out this afternoon.. but still hasn't ""farted"" so can't leave yet. Another day at least."
163690,Mike the Pike,2008-02-24 02:14:00,3421,Wow I didn't know your daughter had Crones .  So young to have all that.  Good to hear she will get back on track.  Now the shot of you with those puke bowls well my pepsi just about came out my nostroles lol.  Best wishes to you and your family let the healing begin.  MTP
163692,irishfield,2008-02-24 02:22:00,26272,"Thanks Mike... she's a tough little package. She managed to do her 4 years of University, including her thesis, graduating with honours thru all this mess. I think she got more from her mother than just her looks......"
163910,irishfield,2008-02-24 20:47:00,26272,Discharged at Noon today and they just pulled in the laneway!
163912,Whopper,2008-02-24 20:51:00,2174,Best news I've heard all week  
163271,kennyman,2008-02-22 23:32:00,737,"I also missed the thread where any of this was mentioned. I'm glad everything went well for her. She certainly has a beautiful smile Wayne. She looks like a sweetheart (please don't take that the wrong way). That first pic shows alot of personality. And she's a Leaf fan too!! You gotta love it!     I can just imagine what you were going through. I would have been going nuts if one my kids were going through that. Just think, it's over now. She's going to be better.  P.S.  The puke bowls are quite becoming."
163279,Sandbag,2008-02-22 23:45:00,533,Wow....that's quite a story Wayne.  Sorry to hear that your daughter had to put up with the condition as long as she did.  I wish her only the best and I hope that this surgery will give her the freedom and comfort that far to many of us (myself included) take for granted.  She is certainly a beautiful young lady.  Cheers  Craig
163288,Gerritt,2008-02-22 23:58:00,6129,"Wow... Wayne.. I do not know how I missed these threads about your daughter!?! Sadly I dont read them all.... I dont know how the mods do it! The odd thing is I just heard about a study on Crohns today.. they took a whack of crohns patients and put them on the ""regular"" drug cocktail and gave the steroid's  after as a last ditch effort this control group had a 32% chance of remission... the other control group they put them on a hefty dose of steroids before and the regular meds (more aggressive therapy) This control group had closer to 70% chance at remission!  Funny how things work sometimes... first I listen to the news about this study.. then I find out about your girl...   I wish her and your family all the best Wayne. I hope this becomes a distant memory for her and something she can tell her grandchildren about   Gerritt."
163293,GbayGiant,2008-02-23 00:05:00,1780,"That's great Wayne, I hope for the best, sounds like she'll be better than ever very soon."
163323,Bernie,2008-02-23 01:10:00,3190,Glad to see she is up and about and the surgery successful Wayne. You never stop worrying about your children no matter what their age.
163335,Smokey,2008-02-23 01:26:00,1278,Good news to here she's recovering well and hopefully this will be the end of it. Make sure she gets lots of rest and give the area time to heal.  Best wishes to her.  Mike
163339,irishfield,2008-02-23 01:30:00,26272,"Thanks guys !  Yes Mike... she'll be coming back home with us for the next few months so she can recover fully and not get caught back up in the ""city"" life too soon (she actually lives just south of Jarvis and Carlton). I've just gotta remember to pull my end of the work load once she's home.... or I'll have another important gal of mine hospitalized in no time."
163340,jigger08,2008-02-23 01:30:00,38,"Best wishes for your ""tough-as-nails"" daughter."
163346,tbayboy,2008-02-23 01:37:00,1497,Glad to here things went well.  Best wishes to everyone.
163355,fishing n autograph,2008-02-23 01:55:00,2540,Great to hear! I wish her a speed recovery!
163356,Loonietoon,2008-02-23 01:56:00,1450,"Happy to hear thing are going well Wayne.. Like Mo said, we would like to see you both there but.... there are more important thing you have to do right now... Take care of them Girls Wayne  We will see you alll later but most of all take care of your self as well my friend"
163362,Nanook,2008-02-23 02:12:00,565," Great news Wayne, good to hear. Sounds like Jen has the strength and fortitude of her parents. Its easy to see where  she gets her looks from.   With TLC at home, I'm sure she will make a full recovery, and leading the life a young girl should. Best wishes to you all."
