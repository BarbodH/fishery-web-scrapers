Tried many of my waypoints from 7am-12pm with nothing but only a single bump on my williams.  Things didnt look good at this point but we never gave up!   Moved away from the  masses and fished some structure that i have produced fish off before.  Finally FISH ON!  Limits all around.  Nice to see the mnr out there, taking samples from our fish.   "
