As you can see, it was a wonderful day on Simcoe, with robins' egg skies, almost no breeze, and temperatures that rose to the freezing mark.  It was tremendous to meet  up again with old friends and share some stories, lies, and laughs.                                                It was an honour to be  part of Maureen's annual do once again, and to be part of this great group of folks."
