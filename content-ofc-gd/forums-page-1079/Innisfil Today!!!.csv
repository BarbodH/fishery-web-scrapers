Conditions on the ice will be great for your event in the morning. I even seen a few cars and trucks out bombing around( I would not take mine out). Marked good numbers of fish so hopefully they will cooperate on Sat. Sounds like your day will be a blast,  wish I did not have to work!!! Good luck! RF    Heres a shot off the launch looking out on the lake   One of the Lakers caught and released   A little whitie, Looks like a herring but its not. "

163735,Rustic-Fisher,2008-02-24 05:57:00,826,Head out towards the group of huts. That puts you in 70' min. From there break away from the crowds. Heading North East towards the Island may pay off  RF
