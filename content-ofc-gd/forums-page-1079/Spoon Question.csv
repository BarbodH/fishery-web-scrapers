The clacker was a short piece of wire maybe 1 1/2"" or 2"" long with glass and brass beads designed to tap against each other creating a tapping or rattling sound as the lure moved through the water.  They caught northern pike, walleye and smallmouth bass (of course they always catch fish on these shows).  It looked like a good idea and I was wondering if anyone had used a clacker on spoons like the Williams Wabler, Dardevle, Lucky Strike Half Wave, etc. and might have some advise."
