163568,irishfield,2008-02-23 22:24:00,26272,"So I went to bed last night around 1:45.. awoke out of my first deep sleep in weeks to an alarm clock going off at 4:55. First thought was who the hell set that...and then came to my senses and remembered it was me! LOL  Got the sled loaded up and headed for Innisfil. Watched the sun come up while I waited for Terry to arrive.    We got out in 80FOW for a few hours with Joey, Tybo, Reefhawg, Graftongal (and their nice lab) and Fishnsled, Percher and Biteme came along later on.  Terry with auger problems... had to actually drill a couple by hand this morning!    Reefhawg    Sandy playin catch with the lab    Dan (Percher) and Biteme show up and had moved three times.  Dan drilling a hole the easy way.    Biteme and Terry    We left Adam and Sandy behind.....    and moved out past Fox Island where many got into some Perch... including CCMTCanada getting his first ""ice"" fish. I think he's hooked now.. LOL.  Joanne looking good...    Bassmastermike, Tybo, Chuck in truck.. I think douG on tailgate and Bly.    I believe this is Shooter and his wife.    Fishnsled (Will) and CCMTCanada (Cliff)    Cliff with his first monster thru the ice.. come'on Cliff stretch them arms!  "

The bite picked up just after everyone left the area, so we kept on fishing and ended up missing lunch. LOL.    My arms hurt after stretching them that far for that pic too!!!!"
