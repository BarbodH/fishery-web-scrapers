Check out the link below.  http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/tournaments/live/index  I spent a lazy afternoon yesterday watching the anglers load their boats and head to the day 2 weigh-in.  Alton Jones leads with Charlie Hartley about 1lb behind.  So nice to see those boats out on the water in February."
