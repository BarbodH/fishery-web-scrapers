163685,Joey,2008-02-24 02:06:00,9122,"Nice report Ryan, and thanks again for the lures, it was very generous.  I'll let you know how they perform for me.  Its funny, the girl in your pictures has her cuffs on her pants turned up and when she was walking across the ice in the distance, before we knew who you were, we thought her boots were the florescent orange colour.  Gave us a chuckle.  Joey"
