163744,cisco,2008-02-24 10:35:00,597,Thank you for the posting help Iceguy and BillM.  10lb ling  whities snubbing our offerings
163747,Roy,2008-02-24 11:48:00,13728,"Great videos Chris. Glad you persevered through the posting process. If the ling was 10lbs, would you say those whities were in the 4-6lbs range? It IS interesting to see what goes on down there."
163760,Spiel,2008-02-24 12:56:00,9065,"...Way cool, I like how quickly that ling blasted skyward."
163783,Terry,2008-02-24 14:00:00,14456,great vid Chris lots of whitefish around
163787,Gerritt,2008-02-24 14:07:00,6129,Awesome vids!  I too like seeing that ling skyrocketing to the surface the camara was blasted by chummed minnows awesome!  Thanks again!  G
163789,tbayboy,2008-02-24 14:13:00,1497,"Very cool, lings are weird fish if you ask me .  By the way, now that you've gotten the uploads going there's one more trick you can do.  When your entering your post here look down under the editting box to where it says post options and switch it to html on - auto linebreak mode.  Then instead of putting in a link you copy the value in the video page thats called ""html code"" and looks like this.     And voila you get the videos right in your post here on OFC!  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i225.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid225.photobucket.com/albums/dd49/cisco5577/PLUS0004.flv"">  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i225.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid225.photobucket.com/albums/dd49/cisco5577/PLUS0006.flv"">"
163791,lunkerbasshunter,2008-02-24 14:18:00,2585,wow great videos.  I hope in that ling video all those minnows were real and not plasctic.  it looked like the whole bottom was covered with them.  cheers!
163793,Casey123,2008-02-24 14:22:00,461,Great quality on the video.  how deep were you?  Thanks for sharing.

163820,irishfield,2008-02-24 16:15:00,26272,Thanks for that great view of what goes on in the basement Chris !
163824,Photoz,2008-02-24 16:19:00,792,"Better'n watchin' TV, first time I watched something like that . . . .     who says fish are stupid . . . . .     they certainly were VERY cautious around the bait with the hooks? I've watched them on the Vex as l'il 'blips,' sometimes they'd rise 3' or more with the jig, before dropping back . . . .    musta watched 50 of 'em, over a whole morning one day, doing that . . . .    but nary a nudge? Wonder why?"
163827,cisco,2008-02-24 16:24:00,597,Thanx TbayBoy. Will do next time.  Got 3 whitefish 2-3lbs then next day lost one 7lbs at the hole then yesterday pals got a 6 and a couple 3-4lbers.  Re minnows... dead ones. Limit is 120 in possession so over a few days of dumping a few dozen down each day.... once down they're no longer in possession... the bottom has some tempting treats.  That ling was 9.8lbs exactly. Here's my pal's 10 year old son Hank holding up his prize. 
163834,Joey,2008-02-24 16:39:00,9122,Awesome videos Chris.  I like the ling one.  Ziiiiing to the surface.  Joey
