163462,wkrp,2008-02-23 14:31:00,656,To all you musky guys out there. What type or brand of hook cutter  works the best .
163463,silveradosheriff,2008-02-23 14:47:00,1025,I love my Knipex.
163464,iceguy,2008-02-23 14:48:00,341,Saw my buddy Siveradosheriff cut through some thick hooks like butter with a knipex(spelling?) cutters.
163465,mistyjr1,2008-02-23 14:49:00,97,"I agree with silveradosheriff Knipex. You can also use small Bold cutters, but they dont work as well.  You get what you pay for.  Mistyjr1"
163471,lew,2008-02-23 15:03:00,12767,"Yup, if your looking for top quality, definetely go with the Knipex. They'll cost you some extra $$$$ but you'll be very happy you spent a bit more when it's time to cut some heavy hooks in a hurry.  I'd suggest the ones with the spring in them for opening them up automatically too, at least that's the one I use and it just makes life that much easier.  Ordered mine from the Ringlord and had them in 2 days  http://www.theringlord.com"
163495,taper,2008-02-23 16:56:00,611,Lew are the ones you have the first set on the list of cutters?
163496,mattyk,2008-02-23 16:57:00,2110,I also got a pair of Knipex and love them. They work great and i bought them from chadstoolbox online. They were $15 cheaper than other places.
163509,lew,2008-02-23 17:39:00,12767, These are mine here taper.....cobalt cutter.......kx7111200  That spring makes a big difference in my opinion  
163525,taper,2008-02-23 18:58:00,611,Thanks Lew.
163528,camillj,2008-02-23 19:17:00,1988,  Yep ... I bought those too ... its amazing the difference .. like cutting through butter
163560,wkrp,2008-02-23 21:37:00,656,This is why I like this site. Thanks a lot guys. Knippex it will be
