The snowy winter of 2007 - 2008 continues.  Another snowstorm is expected to affect southern Ontario Tuesday.  The low pressure centre should develop over Colorado late tonight and track to the northeast as it intensifies Monday and Tuesday.  The latest computer models are showing that the low will stay to the south of the Great Lakes. This means yet another snowfall for most of southern Ontario.. Beginning Monday night over southwestern Ontario and Tuesday morning over eastern Ontario.  Snowfall in the Toronto area may start near the Tuesday morning rush.  Current indications are that 10 to 15 centimetres of snow are likely for regions near lakes Erie and Ontario with lesser amounts further north.  There is the potential for higher amounts of snow as well as freezing rain especially near the lake shores of Erie and Ontario and Along the St Lawrence river.  However this far in advance..Much uncertainty remains about the track of the low and the associated snow amounts.  Environment Canada will continue to monitor this situation closely and will issue further statements and watches and warnings as required.  Listen for further statements. Additional information may also be found by consulting the latest public forecast. The next public forecast will be issued by 5 AM.  END/ALSEN/MA"
