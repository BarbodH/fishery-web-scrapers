163569,Andrew,2008-02-23 22:24:00,54,"I may be wrong, but i'm guessing they are for the sugar plant.. Red Path or something??"
163571,irishfield,2008-02-23 22:27:00,26272,"If you're seeing three big ""stacks""... you've been into it too soon TJ."

163582,Sandbag,2008-02-23 22:40:00,533,Is there a McDonalds on the opposite side of Yonge Street from you.  Or can you see the hooker in the red pumps...lol  Cheers  Craig
163583,irishfield,2008-02-23 22:40:00,26272,  When is the show TJ?
163585,TJQ,2008-02-23 22:41:00,7806,OK... one more ticket to the person who tell me what floor im on....
163588,Spiel,2008-02-23 22:42:00,9065,    I mean way to go Wayne.
163589,Spiel,2008-02-23 22:42:00,9065,  How many choices are there?
163590,irishfield,2008-02-23 22:45:00,26272,Based on the camera angle.. I'd say... I'll let someone else try a guess!
163591,lew,2008-02-23 22:45:00,12767,"I think the stack on the right is the old Hearn generating station down at Cherry Beach TJ, and the one on the left looks like the sewage treatment plant over near Coxwell. Not sure about the one in the center but it's probably to do with the Hearn plant too.  If you pan your camera another 90 degrees to your left and look to the horizon, that's me waving to you from the house with the brown roof and the snow on the front lawn"
163592,TJQ,2008-02-23 22:46:00,7806,LOL.. Actually the show was last nite... found that out when we got here... it was really neat to see... Rick is a funny dude.. but was a bit irritated after I told him that his show was a blatent waste of my tax dollars... lol  he is a small dude.... but a really nice guy!
163594,Sandbag,2008-02-23 22:50:00,533,That is awesome TJ.  Rick Mercer is one funny guy.  I'll bet he would be a hoot to spend a few hours with.  Cheers  Craig
163596,Spiel,2008-02-23 22:51:00,9065,"....Wow, Rick Mercer standing with a well known celebrity.  Thanks Lew, I thought that was the generating station on the right, due to the building actually. Just couldn't remember the name."
163599,Roy,2008-02-23 22:59:00,13728,I'd say you're on the living room floor...about now.
163600,mistaredone,2008-02-23 23:10:00,913,21st?
163601,FishHeadRic,2008-02-23 23:10:00,226,Lew got  the two right. The one on the right is the ole Hearn power plant. Coal burner I believe. The one on the far left is from the poo-poo factory and the other one in the middle  I think is from an old brick yard  factory.   FHR
163602,mistaredone,2008-02-23 23:10:00,913,22nd?
163603,mistaredone,2008-02-23 23:11:00,913,23rd?
