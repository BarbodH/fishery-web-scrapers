If you or maybe your 20 something children would like the tickets, you can have them.  I'll even meet or courier them to you.  The concert is next Friday, February 29, at 8 p.m. at The Sound Academy, 11 Polson Street.  I was going to take them to the Tyler Event today as a giveaway, but forgot  Thanks  Joey"
