163662,GbayGiant,2008-02-24 01:32:00,1780," Yeah I agree, lot's of duplicates, but who knows how many he harvests, the fact he encourages keeping them is what gets me, but anyway it looks likes he's on the lower French, not far at all from the mouth of the bay."
163769,Spiel,2008-02-24 13:34:00,9065," Thanks Raf, I've learned something today. I actually have no idea where the damns are but there was a set of falls I could have gone over in the Dry Pine Bay area if'n I weren't careful. I suppose that led me to believe I was on the upper. That was some 26 years ago and It's still fairly clear in my mind but don't ask me what I did yesterday....lol"
163796,bassman,2008-02-24 14:52:00,384,"You guys have determined that this guy has been catching and eating his fish legally, however, you are still raking him over the coals. If you guys think that this species should be protected, take it up with the MNR not the guy who followed the regulations."
163416,OhioFisherman,2008-02-23 04:37:00,6623,"LOL John, Ohio Redneck not Virginia there is a difference. Virginia and Alabama rednecks can talk to each other without translators. I am far enough north to understand most Canadians! eh?  Catfish? fun to catch if they are big. Probably even ate some at some point in my life, gramps used to clean them and they lived upstairs."
163417,GbayGiant,2008-02-23 04:48:00,1780,"Yeah I should have remembered. I have a case of attention deficit disorder and short term memory loss, this was a self diagnosis but I'm sure the doctors would agree, I pretty sure the Alzheimer's will kick in around the time I'm 39 at this rate."
163422,Raf,2008-02-23 05:04:00,3495,this lodge is located in the dry pine bay area of the french.. it's what i would call the middle lower french.  just east of the hwy 69 bridge.  i believe (but would have to double check as the regs may have changed) that you are in fact allowed to fish sturgeon in this part of the river (ie. below the dams in nippissing).
163446,Spiel,2008-02-23 11:53:00,9065,"....While it has been some time since I fished Dry Pine Bay I think it's part of the upper French River (main channel). It's in the area south of Alban on the map. The lower being west of HWY#69.    And while I certainly don't condone keeping any sturgeon in the Nipissing region I don't think those pictures show lots of killing. Like the other pictures on the site there are many duplicates. I think in all those shots we're seeing three sturgeon.  From the 2008 regs....  Lake Nipissing - ncluding the waters of the French River from the Chaudière and the Little Chaudière dams to Lake Nipissing; the west bay of Lake Nipissing in Haddo Twp.; the northwest bay of Lake Nipissing to the falls of MacPherson Creek; the Sturgeon River from Lake Nipissing to the dam at Sturgeon Falls; the Veuve River from Lake Nipissing to the chutes located in Lot 5 in Conc. l in Caldwell Twp.; the South River from Lake Nipissing to Highway 654; and the entire West Arm of Lake Nipissing including Cross Lake. / Lake sturgeon closed all year.  Now if I could just find a copy of the old regs.  I think he also needs to bone up on his facts....  ""They have different names. People call them Lake Sturgeon and River Sturgeon but the proper name is White Sturgeon.""  White Sturgeon....Acipenser transmontanus Lake Sturgeon....Acipenser fulvescens"
163454,Casey123,2008-02-23 13:35:00,461," Allowed or not, it would be great to see someone use a little common sense. I will allow you to draw your own conclusions but if it tastes like alligators, I can gaurantee that the fishermen are not from Thunder Bay."
163538,walleyejigger,2008-02-23 20:00:00,876,"i wouldn't think anything that old n ugly would taste too good anyways, but to each his own, if nobody's breaking the law that is  sturgeon are the # one species that i've never caught but would like to catch the most"
163551,Moosebunk,2008-02-23 21:09:00,3970,"Funny, but the guy who outfits up on Ogoki for the sturgeon fishing up there seems to think they're ""white sturgeon"" too.  Check Wikepedia doods, it's free - online.  Anyway... regs in most places are 1 a day to keep.  Native folks up here seem to quite enjoy the taste, but, belly meat should be cut out.  If you're thinking of fishing them expect slow days, but a great fight once you hook one.  A friend of mine up here caught a 44""er that was 22lbs and that fish pulled at his 20lb test line for 35 minutes before finally giving up.  I've hooked one... couldn't land in on a light rod with 6lb mono, but man.. it gave me 15-20 minutes of insanity.  They're good hearty fish for sure, maybe as strong as chinook of equal weight, but a fair bit slower.  I don't think they should be kept at all.  Just personal.  They're ancient..."
163630,Raf,2008-02-24 00:32:00,3495,"spiel, for regulation purposes, ""they"" call anything below the chaudiere dams to gbay the ""lower"", while anything above them to nippissing is the ""upper"".   the dams are located in dokis (further east than your map shows), up-river from dry pine bay & the regs you quoted don't apply to this area of the french.  the regs in this area are probably more strict when compared to Nip with the exception of sturgeon - slot sizes for all sport fish including pike & bass and a 48"" muskie minimum which they are trying (& maybe succesful now) to implement on the ""upper"".  I'd let 'em all go too."
