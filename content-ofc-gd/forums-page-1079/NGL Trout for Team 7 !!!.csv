I am fully expecting to post my biggest 2008 NGL Trout for my team next weekend ... and would HATE to see it not count  ... I'm taking pictures with the logo ... but what date do I need to put on it ????   Just kidding .. besides ... now I am pretty much destined to do a peppy-la-pew  Oh .. btw ... in case I am not here ... I ONLY register fish for team 7 .. so its better that I get put on that team

164013,irishfield,2008-02-25 00:16:00,26272,Well I released the winner last week Jon ! Since a tourney hasn't been started yet... I guess I'll have to pass now. Will never get another monster like that...
