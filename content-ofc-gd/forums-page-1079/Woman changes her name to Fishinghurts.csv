She loves watching me fish off her dock and grill a fresh steak and freshly cleaned walleye on her BBQ.   Then I ask her, hows the veggie burger taste ? by the way you know your new purse and shoes are leather rite ?  Another question do you have to be a feminist or homosexual to apply to P3TA ? I'd be interested to know how many straight males are on board.  No offence to the awesome fishergirls, I know lot's of woman love fishing too."

In case anyone hasn't heard Bill Engvall's ""Here's Your Sign"" yet,  ""...Couple of months ago, I went fishin' with a buddy of mine.  We pulled his boat into the dock, I lift up this big ol string of bass, and this idiot up on the dock says 'Hey, did y'all catch all them fish?'  'Nope!  Talked them into givin' up.  Heeeeeere's your sign.'..."""
162944,JerseyDog,2008-02-22 01:15:00,190,"You know what - she might have a point.  I as well think fishing probably does hurt fish in some kind of way. I have no doubt getting slaughtered hurts the beef cattle and the chickens we all happily gobble down and I am pretty sure getting wacked with a .306 hurts the deer & moose we hunt (for however a brief period of time). And when I die, its probably going to hurt and its definately going to suck.  I just don't spend a lot of time pretending I'm any better or worse than my game or quarry. I am just one animal of many doing his best to survive in a cruel world.  And when its my time, I will return to the earth from where I came, same as all gods creatures."

163188,livinisfishin,2008-02-22 20:01:00,661,"I agree with jersey dog except for the fact that we as humans are just trying to do our part to survive. You dont see  a deer bustin' out a rifle and waiting for the next human to walk by. You dont see a fish actually fishing for humans. Animals dont exactly have a big chance to get away from that shot of a rifle and fish obviously arent all that smart to tell the difference between a lure and the real things they eat. Sure that girl is wacked out a bit but give her some credit for going up and doing something to try and make a difference. I am definately not going to throw in my fishing rod for hiking boots but i do try and minimize the ""pain or stress"" a fish endures while in the process of catching and releasing. I have never picked up a gun or bow to target a mammal but im not saying i will never do that either. Be thankful that the fish and the animals are there for us to hunt and keep or release."

163870,holdfast,2008-02-24 18:25:00,1813,"Come on, Typical of the bleeding heart society we live in and those trying to push it on people.  Lets face facts here, if it wasn't for some type of weapon, ingenuity (traps, pits, trained animals to hunt) etc we would all be living off each other.  Our forefathers have always hunted, usually with some sort of an advantage over the animal.  Now its mostly sport, I suppose you feed the birds or pigeons, which to some people are feeding the weak and sick but that's another story.  Now as far as Miss Nutcase, I also think that the Judge is a bit of a nutcase for allowing such Idiotic requests.  But then again, men with men, and women with women, are legally allowed to adopt, raise a child born through artificial or natural means.  So he is probably shaking his head as it maybe out of his hands.  But my question is when is this crap going to stop, never as long as there is only one who objects."

164192,Carp,2008-02-25 06:15:00,1488,"  Now that I think about it, whenever I know I'm going fishing, I always seem to be in an amourous mood. (before and after)  +  = more   I was never a great math student, but this equation seems about right to me.   This girl needs to find something else to draw attention to herself. How about running through the streets naked? The bait shops will be packed the next day."
162730,Joey,2008-02-21 15:20:00,9122,"Flagstaff, Ariz. - What's in a name? Just ask 21-year-old Flagstaff resident Rachel Feather, who is changing her legal name to FishingHurts. Although she requested the name FishingHurts.com--after P3TA's anti-fishing Web site--a judge denied the "".com"" suffix. So Feather decided to take the judge up on the offer to allow her to change her name to FishingHurts, and she intends to ask friends, family members, and acquaintances to call her FishingHurts.com anyway. Why the focus on fish? Feather--who went vegetarian on a dare from her friends after viewing an investigation on factory farms when she was 13--calls fish the ""forgotten animal."" She points out that fish experience stress and pain, just like chickens, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.  When fish are dragged from the ocean's depths, they undergo excruciating decompression. Many slowly suffocate, are crushed to death, or are cut up while still alive on ships' decks. On fish farms, they are stuffed into tanks so tightly that they can barely move. They stew in a toxic bath of feces, chemicals, and antibiotics until they are slaughtered. ""Sport"" fishing also causes suffering. Besides enduring the pain caused by hooks, a high percentage of fish caught in catch-and-release tournaments die within a matter of days.  Fish and Fisheries has cited more than 500 research papers on fish intelligence that prove that fish can use tools and have impressive long-term memories and sophisticated social structures. They develop relationships and communicate with each other, have individual personalities, and grieve when their companions die.  ""I hope that by changing my name, people will be inspired to trade in their fishing rods for hiking boots and their fish sandwiches for veggie burgers,"" says the soon-to-be FishingHurts, who grew up in a family of hunters but whose sister and mother are now vegan and vegetarian, respectively. ""Fish should be respected, not mutilated on hooks or dragged up from the sea. I'll remind people of that every time they say or read my name."""
162731,Roy,2008-02-21 15:24:00,13728,Someone should splain to Mrs. Potato head that fish grieve when their companion leaves because they sense that their next meal has just been stolen from them.

Lets see, she doesn't eat fish because it hurts them, she is a vegetarian though.  I bet you there is something in her Lifestyle where an Animal of some form has been killed for her sorry ass existence.  Can anybody think of a few.  Maybe we should feed it all to P3TA or whatever they call themselves."
162733,Roy,2008-02-21 15:31:00,13728,Great idea for a Youtube clip. Mrs. fishinghurts face to face with a cougar trying to explain to the cat that a brussel sprout would be far better for its health.
