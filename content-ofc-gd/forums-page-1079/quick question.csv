163610,BFSC Kevin,2008-02-23 23:34:00,1351,"so.. i noticed that bps has 3.5hp merc on sale. not too sure if its a good deal or not but then im just thinking, would 3.5hp be strong enough for my 16ft, 700lb crestliner as a kicker?  thanks kevin"
163612,Fisherman,2008-02-23 23:39:00,7201,"On a calm day it will get you where you're going, you might want to presubmit your Canada pension request though.  I tried a 3HP on the back of my 16' Princecraft, bare fishing boat, just not enough with the slightest wind.  I would not do it."
163616,BFSC Kevin,2008-02-23 23:44:00,1351,ah. gotcha. thanks
163623,lew,2008-02-23 23:50:00,12767,"Kevin, I had a 6 hp kicker on my Crestliner and even that wouldn't turn the boat into a good crosswind unless I cranked it right up."
163627,BFSC Kevin,2008-02-24 00:22:00,1351,"thanks Lew, looks like 3.5 will definitely be not enough.. but even 6hp was no good? your crestliner is probably bigger than mine though."
163631,lew,2008-02-24 00:33:00,12767,"Mines about 1400 pounds including the motor Kevin and the 6 hp moved it fine but just had problems in a turn with a good crosswind, but it would probably work well on yours."
164338,boatman,2008-02-25 19:00:00,350,Many people suggest a kicker of at least 10% the max rating of the boat. My boat is rated for 28 hp and a 3 hp is just big enough so I'd say its a fair estimate.
164341,Gerritt,2008-02-25 19:24:00,6129,"Kevin,  I have 9.9 2 stoke in awesome condition. I will send pics if interested.  G"
