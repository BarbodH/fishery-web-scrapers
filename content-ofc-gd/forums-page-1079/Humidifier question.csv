163393,Daplumma,2008-02-23 03:28:00,1961,Honeywell has a new steam humidifier coming out soon or may be out already.Has a remote steam jenny and tube to the plenum for tight installations.Anyone have one yet and what do you think of it? Joe
163461,bigfish1965,2008-02-23 14:20:00,3382,Uhhh..I had toast for breakfast.
163466,Tinman,2008-02-23 14:52:00,376,have you got a link to this humidifier that i may take a look at? I haven't heard of it yet. I recommend when i install a humidifier is a flow through type. But i wouldn't mind reading up on the steam one
163468,Daplumma,2008-02-23 14:58:00,1961,I cant find them on line yet.They were hyping them at the trade show and were to be released in late January.Was hoping someone had seen or installed one. Joe
163470,Tinman,2008-02-23 15:02:00,376,"I'll have to see fi they have any info somewhere, sounds like a great concept"
163472,Tinman,2008-02-23 15:03:00,376,http://yourhome.honeywell.com/Consumer/Cul...eam/Default.htm  here is the link i think
163474,Daplumma,2008-02-23 15:04:00,1961,"Let me know if you find anything.Its not the clunky plenum mounted,but the new one.Should sell for around 5-600 American. Joe"
163475,Tinman,2008-02-23 15:06:00,376,was that the correct link? I would stay away from the clunky barrel  style.
163477,Daplumma,2008-02-23 15:18:00,1961,I saw that link while searching and it may be that one.I left the spec sheet at my parents house.If I can find it I'll let you know.Found this also http://www.airassurance.com/hotproducts/humidifier.cfm and this..Not available until April.The price looks good though. http://www.cleanairsystemsinc.net/humidifiers.html Joe
163484,nofish4me,2008-02-23 16:13:00,404,"I would consider what it'll cost to replace components after everything gets limed up. Find out what average operating time will be before its all limed up and needs major cleaning or replacement parts. I've serviced several steam type humidifiers. Some have plastic canisters and they don't last the winter without problem, in certain water conditions. Steam is a great way for humidifying, but, but....."
163491,Tinman,2008-02-23 16:52:00,376,WHat is a good brand to look at then?
163510,Daplumma,2008-02-23 17:40:00,1961,I am concerned about the mineral deposits as we are on well water.My parents have a steam shower but so far so good with that unit.Our well should be about the same.I would love to talk to someone who has seen and installed one of these units but it doesn't look like it is available yet.It looks like they have addressed many of the maintanance issues. Joe
163622,Fisherman,2008-02-23 23:50:00,7201,"Ya, I just stand close to the coffee maker, lots of humidity coming off that and it smells good."
163699,Daplumma,2008-02-24 03:07:00,1961,"That coffee stuff is full of humididy for sure..I miss that cup of joe in the morning for sure, Joe"
