Let me start out by saying that Steve, Jen and the boys did a great job of organizing the event and they go out of their way to make you feel welcome.  Everybody that I talked to had a blast.  As predicted, the weather was great.  Arrived at 6:30am and unloaded for the 7:00am blast-off.  Set up straight out from the marina @50 metres from shore.  The morning bite was pretty good.  Our group of four landed five and lost a couple of others.  Dan (Percher) may recognize this hut        One of the guys in our group landed a good size Pickeral (7.85 lbs) early in the day and it hung on to be the big fish of the tournament.  Sorry I don't have a shot of that fish, but it was a live release tournament and we were ill prepared to transport it to the weigh station when he caught it.  I ended up dumping gear out of the cooler and filling it with water for the run to the scales.  Must have been pretty funny to watch from the sidelines.  Made it to the scales and she swam away to fight again another day.  Here is a shot of the end of the day at the prize table    A great day had by all.  Thanks again Steve and Jen for all your hard work.  Cheers  Craig"
