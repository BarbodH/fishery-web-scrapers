164243,snag,2008-02-25 14:18:00,1932,Your hired!  I saw Bob Izumi eating perch from T.O. water. Apparently it's O.K. when they are a small/young fish.  I guess what I'm saying is that if we get out in the spring again our new wager will be on who gets to clean and cook our shore lunch!
164007,ccmtcanada,2008-02-24 23:58:00,7971,"Well, I've been on this board for over a year now, and bly and I pretty much live release everything we catch.  Well, at the Fishing for Tyler event yesterday, we brought home a bunch of perch with the idea of trying our first fish fry..... <BR><BR> Ok...so we had a sink full of Perch....had to figure out how to clean them all...<BR>  <BR> A quick search on the internet brings up a bunch of videos and sites that show you how to clean fish.  So, I chose one of them and decided to try to clean them.  I'm sure I left some meat on them, but I managed to get thru this exercise in about 45 minutes.  I had my helper handing me the fish one at a time, while I sliced them up.....<BR>  <BR><BR>  <br> Then, using TJs secret batter recipe, we fried them up...and the kitchen was filled with sweet smells! <br><br> <embed width=""320"" height=""240"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i120.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid120.photobucket.com/albums/o185/ccmtcanada/Fishing%20for%20Tyler%202008/DSCN4998.flv""> <br><BR>  And here's the final result....and it turned out great!!! "
164011,Greencoachdog,2008-02-25 00:10:00,8163,That's great Cliff!!!  Your daughter looks adorable handing you those fish with the glove on!  Looks like the fish came out perfectly for you  ... I wonder what Muskie tastes like fried eh?
164021,Radnine,2008-02-25 00:31:00,1538,"I am having a hard time believing that someone with 4199 posts on a fishing forum has never cleaned a fish before! Thereâ€™s hope for me yet. I cleaned my first fish last summer (at the tender age of 45). It is still frozen in the freezer. It looks like it was a nice father daughter bonding moment, and thanks for the great video."
164023,solopaddler,2008-02-25 00:33:00,8605,"Nice job Cliff, the end result looks great."
164024,BFSC Kevin,2008-02-25 00:35:00,1351,yum...
164034,Sinker,2008-02-25 00:43:00,8692,WOW.....I bet you'll be keeping a few more perch from now on eh.....LOL.  Looks good for the first time......the filleting get easier the more you do it!!  Sinker
164035,Rich Clemens,2008-02-25 00:45:00,3131,A feast fit for a king and his family.    Very nice.

164039,Bly,2008-02-25 00:49:00,1556,"  There is always hope lol  As we were fishing yesterday Cliff was tellimg to me that I had work to do when I got home.....no worries, received a new fillet nice for Christmas and was looking forward to using it.....surprise....Cliff decided to give it a try!  He did a great job!"
164041,motv8tr,2008-02-25 01:03:00,2587,Looks good  Maureen
164043,Sandbag,2008-02-25 01:08:00,533,Radnine...you read my mind..lol  Cheers Craig
164051,ccmtcanada,2008-02-25 01:20:00,7971,"What??? LOL.  It's true...most of my fish are caught in Lake Ontario, and I still remember the days in the 70's when the warnings were around about not eating anything from the lake.  I just started fishing a year and a half ago (after a 20 year break) and today was the first time I ever tried to clean and cook fish.  These perch were out of Simcoe so I thought, why not??"
164053,irishfield,2008-02-25 01:20:00,26272, He probably just got tired of waiting for you to get off the phone Bly !
164059,Bly,2008-02-25 01:25:00,1556,    How many fish did you catch yesterday Wayne??
164061,irishfield,2008-02-25 01:27:00,26272,MY Simcoe Limit !
164074,danbouck,2008-02-25 01:41:00,4380,mmm perch!
164092,tjsa,2008-02-25 02:01:00,1578,Well done Cliff.
164102,Mike the Pike,2008-02-25 02:19:00,3421,Me thinks catch and release percentage is going to change.  Walleye is too yummy to throw back of course we don't see small walleye pics from you and Bly.  
164108,Joey,2008-02-25 02:28:00,9122,"Mmmm, now I'm hungry.  Looks like you did a pretty great job cleaning, got some nice sized filets.  So, tell me, how did you get TJ's secret recipe.  Obviously not a secret anymore then eh  Joey"
164112,Rattletrap2,2008-02-25 02:31:00,1652,Very nice work Cliff! looks great!
164159,Casey123,2008-02-25 03:56:00,461,"Cliff,  Way to go on the fish fry.  Nothing like the first time, don't worry its never as much fun again.  My wife and I had our first 2 years ago, now we are hooked on fresh pearch and the occasional walleye."
164214,ccmtcanada,2008-02-25 12:20:00,7971, He revealed it to Bly in a drunken state at Lakair last year...sworn to secrecy of course....  The reciepe that is...get yer mind out of the gutter!!
164236,TJQ,2008-02-25 14:07:00,7806,Cliff... nice job bud....  Your one of the lucky few I share that recipe with....  lol.. but  if i recall I had had a few and bly was hittin' on me....  hard to not give it up!!!  And Joey... we can make a deal... as long as Pauls not around....
