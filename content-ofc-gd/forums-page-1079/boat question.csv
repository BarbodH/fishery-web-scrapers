164015,Fisherman,2008-02-25 00:22:00,7201,"A compass, learn how to use it and your nav chart or map, did I mention A COMPASS, when the GPS dies or is shut off from above, the compass still works.  Do a couple practice runs, and believe in it, they have been around for a looooong time.  Some cheap raingear that stays in the boat in a ""dry box"", along with photocopies of your fishing licence, boaters card and boat registration."
164017,ccmtcanada,2008-02-25 00:29:00,7971,Extra plug!!!
164018,irishfield,2008-02-25 00:30:00,26272,Why Cliff... if you forget to install one... you're not going to remember the other one.....
164052,Guest lundboy,2008-02-25 01:20:00,0,Doesn't Lund chain the plug in so you can't forget or lose it?  Mine is.   Boat registration is a definite in case you are asked.  You can get a big heavy plastic zip bag from Le Barons that will hold papers and maps.  Good compass as mentioned is really important.

164071,danbouck,2008-02-25 01:38:00,4380,Get a safe boating guide and it tells you everything that is MANDATORY. Of course take a few extra things that have been mentioned above
164073,Rizzo,2008-02-25 01:41:00,4754,pair of mouth spreaders and pliars
164097,tschirk,2008-02-25 02:04:00,261,"Buy a water tight Sea Bag and tie a long poly rope to it (good as a throw bag) inside put whistle, flashlight, flares, knife, thermal blanket, waterproof matches, energy food bar, small first-aid kit and any other important items in case you end up abondoning ship (god forbid)"
164099,BFSC Kevin,2008-02-25 02:07:00,1351,duct tape
164149,forrest,2008-02-25 03:28:00,1032,Do people bring reserve gas tanks?  Some electric motors wont start unless they are on a full charge.  Does anyone compensate for that?  Extra batteries for the marine radio and a map to go with the compass.  forrest
164300,maybe,2008-02-25 17:15:00,307,"Plastic bags.  I always keep some ziplocks (""medium"" and ""large"" size, freezer grade) and black garbage bags (Glad ForceFlex) handy, just in case.  There will be times you'll want to keep some small things together (pieces to reassemble when something breaks?), or contain a mess.  If you're going to grab drive-thru, and then eat on the boat like we do, add some plastic grocery bags to the list.  No need to waste an entire black garbage bag just to keep some Timmies packaging from flying out on the lake.  On the mess front, Home Depot has plastic dropsheets for about $3 that store in tiny little places (like inside those 2 rolls of duct tape).  They can protect a lot of upholstry (or keep several people dry in a pinch).  A package of handi-wipes can be nice for anyone who doesn't enjoy powerbait on their sandwich.  One or 2 of those little plastic travel/purse packs of Kleenex.  Pen, mechanical pencil (doesn't need shapening), and notepad."
