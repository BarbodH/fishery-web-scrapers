878372,muskymatt,2014-10-27 00:32:00,2608,"I put a request up on Facebook to see if anyone was interested joining me for a muskie fish today and Patrick answered with a heck ya! It was cold and windy when we launched and it didn't get any better from that. Casting was pretty dead with no follows and boat control tough with the wind so we switched back and forth from casting to trolling. Water temp was 52.9 and it was full of floating crap. Right at the 10:15 am moon rise while trolling a 12' to 15' break line this gorgeous lady payed us a visit. Not much of a fight but just stayed deep and head shakes.  Tried to follow it up with a second fish but no takers.  49"" and no girth!  "

Sorry, actually what I meant was that we did not measure the girth, but she was a nice fat fish for sure! Very healthy and looked like it was starting to fatten up for the winter."
