879025,Rod Caster,2014-11-01 14:33:00,5784,"Of course it's about Halloween itself, and it's very warranted for change. It's candy making kids sick haha, to an outsider (even me, a born catholic), it's a dumb event no matter how much you sugar coat it (so to speak) and try to call it a 'tradition', Let's go back to halloween 100 years ago when it was likely more pure and I'll reconsider my position, then again if I chose not to participate in christian traditions then I likely wouldn't want to participate in halloween ..... There is a catholic school board; I'm sure they have kept that tradition more than the public system. There are also church/religion/community groups that do a great job of gathering people etc, nobody is trying to change a cultural identity, but it should only represent it's actual relevance/weight in society as a whole, still, the biggest point is that halloween is completely money driven now.  Family day is the best holiday and best represents the actual so-called ""values"" condescendingly and vaguely presented in the commericial holidays, until money ruins that too."
879042,kickingfrog,2014-11-01 16:16:00,8333,"Many Christian base religions do not like many, or all, parts of Halloween either but don't let that get in the way of indignation."

The fact is that it isn't just Halloween, it is about all the other things that we are loosing that were part of our heritage, customs, traditions and Christian religion. Halloween is just one more block in the wall that is going to devide this country; are you familiar with the term divide and conquer."

Halloween is just one more block in the wall that is going to devide this country; are you familiar with the term divide and conquer.   The topic is about halloween, halloween is a bastardized tradition built on freaking people out, marketing, money, unhealthy food and apparently, power. Obviously there will be opposition to it and eventually people will shy away from it. Customs like this have their place, but we can't expect everyone in the country, until the end of time to just play along. Have we ever known a massive group of people who all agree on the same thing forever??  If halloween was actually based on the fall harvest and reducing daylight hours (orange and black) it would be great! Most people don't rely on harvesting anything nor do they need to prepare themselves for winter like the majority of people did, many years ago. It's fallen out of step with the times. I even say this from the persepective of a person  (in my early 30's) who rely's heavily on wild food, gardens, raising meat and heating my house with wood off my own property. I wish a custom like halloween could exist, where kids dress up for fun, visit neighbors, and people exchange the things they've harvested/made/preserved that year. Not show off your most expensive pop-cultured costume then drive to a rich suburban neighborhood so you can drive a bunch of snickers into your face.  the relevance of Christianity is a completely different topic haha."

Im sure if I asked my parents they did it as well. What makes a tradition a tradition anyway?  I assumed something repeated over many generations made it tradition.

879358,Joeytier,2014-11-04 00:32:00,3990,"Public school boards are secular by nature, so I don't see what's so surprising about a school choosing not to participate in such an event, even if the religious aspect of the holiday is all but gone these days lol.  Once the kids are out of school, they can dress and celebrate however and whatever they want with their families, so the whole 'Christians getting stripped of their rights' argument is just downright ridiculous."
879377,bigugli,2014-11-04 02:17:00,6138,"For those Christians who feel slighted or offended by our secular school boards, there are alternatives. Catholic schools and other denominational schools might just be one way to help preserve and reinforce your Christian values and traditions"
878898,jbailey,2014-10-31 18:34:00,866,"are you kidding me?  https://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/dailybrew/happy-orange-and-black-day-canadian-schools-turn-122333329.html  It is that spooky time of year when Canadian parents and students in small pockets around the country bristle at being told their schools will not be celebrating Halloween this year. Instead, children will be welcome to celebrate something a little safer, something that doesn’t have its roots in the occult. Call it Spirit Day, or Black and Orange Day, or just Friday. This year’s Ground Zero for anti-Halloween outrage is Windsor, Ont., where parents are unhappy that Anderon Public School has barred Halloween costumes and parties. The Windsor Star reports that the public elementary school has instead implemented “Black and Orange Day.” Which, y’know, are the colours of the Halloween season. There will be no parade, and costumes are outright discouraged, with the school saying it would be neat if kids wore black and orange clothing. Though it’s not all trick, there will be some treat: Classes are welcome to hold discussions about the history of Halloween and the different customs that have been practiced over the years. On its website, Anderon Public Elementary School says they stopped allowing candy a few years ago, and the latest shift is to meet its commitment to inclusivity:   That’s the part that riles some parents: The idea of inclusivity through limitations. “Parents are upset about seeing Canadians continually give up traditions and losing sight of accepting others for whoever they are,” parent Shannon Taylor told the Star. “My nine-year-old son came home (last Friday) and said, ‘Mom, they’re taking away everything that was fun at school.’” The Windsor school isn’t alone. North Ward School in Paris, Ont., is banning Halloween for the first time this year for a variety of reasons, including the increased level of supervision needed to monitor the appropriateness of costumes, and the frequency with which hot, uncomfortable costumes make children cry during class. A London, Ont., school board candidate actually ran on the promise to deny schools the right to ban Halloween based on the fact there is no board policy on the matter. This issue is by no means new. In recent years, a handful of schools have joined the movement against Halloween. Last year, the popular Halloween alternative was “Spirit Day,” so at least we are making progress on that front. Black and Orange Day at least acknowledges that October 31 was once Halloween. Now it has just been given a maudlin name to avoid offending anyone. Sort of like how Ottawa’s CFL team is called the RedBlacks, because who’s going to get offended and mount a petition against a couple of random words smashed together? While Halloween has its roots in Christianity, that influence is gone completely at this time. TheVatican recently condemned Halloween for its “undercurrent of occultism.” Either way, it is increasingly becoming a non-starter in Canadian schools. And parents are noticing. Just wait until classes start marking Dec. 25 with Red and White Ho Ho Happy Day."

And people (adults) are trying to protect it as a value, or a Canadian tradition?  I'm as Canadian as they get and I do not understand the full out defense of these pseudo traditions in schools. They offer all kinds of non-school- based Halloween events in every community. Set up your own traditional event. I will be making up my own tradition with my daughter whereas we do not buy any directly marketed crap, she can dress up if she wants, no trick or treating and several good food donations  , hand delivered in costume maybe,  to charitable organizations, or friends, acquaintances etc . Who wouldn't rather get a deer roast or home grown produce or baked lasagna?. The orange signifies the harvest, now what happened to that aspect of Halloween?

It's the same reason that Christmas and the lords prayer are no longer in our public schools.  On top of that, why the heck shouldn't the kids be allowed to be kids and have some fun.
