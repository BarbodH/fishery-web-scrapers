Currently borrowing an older MAC.  Gonna take a bit of getting used to. Have been too busy to worry about the puter for the past while with harvesting and canning. Had 2 good fish outings with good friends CPH and BigCliff. The first outing was a catching clinic. last weekend was tough conditions and a lot of dinks. Regardless, its always a good time when we get together."
