Got a big male steel, probably around 12 pounds and a small brown around 6 pounds, nice hen, too bad it swallowed deep, tried releasing it but she just wouldn't swim off, so I kept her and was rewarded with a ton of brownie roe and some awesome tasting meat. Had another brown on and a few steel but was too dark to take pics, took a vid. but you can't see crap in it, just hear the reel screaming lol.[/url[/url"
878872,Sinker,2014-10-31 13:31:00,8692,Nice coho.  S.
878876,BowSlayer101,2014-10-31 14:02:00,296,its actually a steelie haha but thanks!
878887,Joeytier,2014-10-31 16:15:00,3990,"I definitely say coho as well, and a very nice one at that!  Very nice fish"
878890,Salmonidstalker,2014-10-31 16:37:00,265,steelie
878893,jimmer,2014-10-31 17:34:00,2730,It has a head like a steelie. You're a beast!!!! That's an awesome fish.
878896,BillM,2014-10-31 18:24:00,17367,"That's a steelhead.  If it were a coho, it would have a way bigger kype especially in almost November."
878904,bow slayer,2014-10-31 19:31:00,1074,"looks like a steelie to me......i just look at the tail,whole tail has spots,then it is a bow,if top half only has spots,it is a coho"
878906,Sinker,2014-10-31 19:31:00,8692,"Ok, so now we ID steelhead by the kype....got it.  S."
878916,Tim Mills,2014-10-31 20:00:00,476,Nice fish bow slayer
878982,Salmonidstalker,2014-11-01 01:28:00,265,"Although it's deceiving from the picture, large male steelhead will develop colour on their lower jaw.  Which makes them look like coho. That is a tank buck Steele. 12lbs at least."
878987,misfish,2014-11-01 01:43:00,29133,"I was going to yap off and say it was a koho, but have learned to wait for the right answer.  It sure does look like one though.  Very nice fish there dude."
878988,Sinker,2014-11-01 02:06:00,8692,Id bet my paycheck on coho.  S.
878994,solopaddler,2014-11-01 10:42:00,8605,Well done! Fishing at night can be very productive as you know. Great way to beat the crowds as well!  Regarding the fish my guess would be steelhead.
878996,dave524,2014-11-01 10:51:00,4508,"Looks like a twin to the steelhead in BillM's avatar, originally thought that fish was a coho, I was wrong."
879020,craigdritchie,2014-11-01 13:46:00,1586,steelhead. No question.
879031,BowSlayer101,2014-11-01 15:00:00,296,"It was a steelie, had spots on the tail and had a tiny bit of pink on the cheeks and sides, thanks for all the nice comments guys!"

879044,BillM,2014-11-01 16:37:00,17367,Id bet my paycheck on coho.  S.  You must like losing money.
