878363,Rod Caster,2014-10-26 23:52:00,5784,"I found two massive yellow birch burls on my property last year and vowed to do something with them. This spring I cut the tree (36"" diam) and removed the two burls then I had to make an actual atv trail to the tree. Finally yesterday after processing all the firewood from that tree, I hauled the burls out of the bush and started cleaning them up. I did all I could do (with the tools I have) with the big one and just started working on the second one, which has worms holes throughout; which, apparently is a good thing (will post pics when its ready).  Pretty cool looking eh? I'm mesmarized by it. In the last two pics, what do you see in the pattern?                    "
878364,spincast,2014-10-26 23:56:00,3279,"that is very cool. Amazing texture  and patterns in burls, but seriously difficult wood to work with - at least for my meager skills. Good job getting it all cleaned up - bet that took a while."
878366,Rod Caster,2014-10-27 00:02:00,5784,"The hardest part for me was getting it off the tree and moving it, kind of dangerous alone. It took about 3hrs to debark and pick clean today...so that part wasn't too bad, and no chance of crushing myself haha. I actually enjoyed doing it!  Lots of work remains to make it showpiece worthy."
878368,chris.brock,2014-10-27 00:18:00,4053,"I see a hunched over old man or fetus  I will give my opinion again when I'm feeling more ""artistic"", Hahaha  Do you burn birch in the wood stove?"
878375,Dozer,2014-10-27 00:34:00,896,"Wow - looks like a fetus or something along those lines... dude, you've got yourself quite the piece.  I see dollars written all over that"
878376,kickingfrog,2014-10-27 00:40:00,8333,I know nothing about that stuff but I can see why someone would pay some bucks for it.
878379,HTHM,2014-10-27 00:49:00,4082,"I see a headless Atlas, put a globe on that and you may have something. Nice piece! If you want to sell it I have a cousin in the business."
878380,Rod Caster,2014-10-27 00:51:00,5784,So it's not just me who sees the fetus shape. Also see a baby gorilla sucking its thumb in the fetal position...which is more pleasant than just fetus.
878381,Dozer,2014-10-27 01:02:00,896,"Fetus is sick and twisted and some will pay for sick and twisted - kijiji Toronto is your best friend if you are going to sell.  The Atlas idea is great too - a wrought iron mangled, warped, twisted globe sitting on top of that can make an artistic statement saying how disfigured and beat up the world is.... $1300 o.b.o."
878383,Dozer,2014-10-27 01:07:00,896,I want to see the finished product - whatever you end up doing to it
878384,Leecher,2014-10-27 01:36:00,7832,I see a bear cub curled over... nice job Chad
878387,Ainsley,2014-10-27 01:49:00,142,Beauty piece.  I'd love to see some of the internal grain on it.  Could make a lot of sweet knife handles with a piece like that.
878390,Rod Caster,2014-10-27 02:01:00,5784,"haha Dozer. I'm gonna leave the artistic touch for others.I have it listed on Kijiji, and I think it's viewable for all of Ontario. I'll definitely keep it if it doesn't sell, but I may have to flip it upside down so I'm not looking at belly fruit all day."
878391,Dozer,2014-10-27 02:05:00,896,"Whoa, never realized its that expensive!!!!!!!!!!!!  Artwork price just went up from 1300 to 3300! LOL"
878401,misfish,2014-10-27 09:57:00,29133,I see a bear cub curled over... nice job Chad   I as well  
878404,Rod Caster,2014-10-27 12:10:00,5784,"Do you burn birch in the wood stove? Yep, both white and yellow. Yellow is just as good as maple I find.  This tree in particular I got about 4-5 face cords."
878405,FloatnFly,2014-10-27 12:12:00,1640,"burls are very pricey, a big one goes for $10,000.   we used to sell the finished bowls at work, and they are impressive."
878413,Headhunter,2014-10-27 13:57:00,5703,"www.Woodchuckers.com Scarborough based supplier of wood for wood workers. Nice folks, I've been in their shop. A lot of ""bowl turners"" there and I wouldn't be surprised if they had a great deal of interest in your burl. Just be sure to move it quickly so it doesn't start to split... it needs to be cut and dried. HH"
878433,manitoubass2,2014-10-27 16:52:00,11391,Thats awesome!
878489,aplumma,2014-10-27 21:31:00,6896,"I have used a sawmill on Oak, Black Walnut, Maple, Cherry, Sassafras, Birch and ironwood. The wood you have is green and if not treated correctly will be as valuable as firewood in a short amount of time.. The wood should be edge sealed and dried professionally. This is done in a controlled environment using a ventilated controlled moisture content to keep the wood from splitting out. The rule of thumb for air drying without a dryer is 1 year per inch thick and seal the edges to keep them from checking and popping. Contact a wood merchant to get advise and help. Most people do not leave the wood as a large hunk because it takes to long to dry as well as a thinner piece is less likely to pop and check.  Best of luck  BTW I saw a bear in the burl.   Art"
878493,davey buoy,2014-10-27 21:37:00,5505,"That's amazing,this is new to me.Hope you can preserve it as mentioned."
878505,Rod Caster,2014-10-27 22:35:00,5784,"Thanks everyone, and Art/Headhunter for the tips on drying.  If I can't move it quickly, that is going to be an issue. That is the next step of research. Right now I need to let the excess moisture (it was in the bush for a few months) leave then I'll see what I can do about curing it properly.  For the second large piece, I think I'll cut it (or get it cut) into blocks so it's easier to handle/store. Who knows, I might want to carve something myself someday.  My neighbor saw a bear too. My Dad saw a fetus and went the artistic route ""we could make an amazing piece of art..."" haha"
878510,Musky or Specks,2014-10-27 22:56:00,2710,You cannot kiln dry burl. It should only be air dried. You need to seal your cuts on the end right away before it starts to check.  I know I worked here www.forloversofwood.com for 10yrs. And I dealt with burls from all over the world on a daily basis. What I see is a nice hand chiseled wash basin.
878526,Nipfisher,2014-10-28 03:29:00,2449,Looks cool. I see the bear cub.
