878374,jackz905,2014-10-27 00:34:00,6,just wondering if i can repair a nick on a blank or would that comprise the warrenty and would it give back almost all its strength
878378,FloatnFly,2014-10-27 00:47:00,1640,"any non factory modification done to the rod will void the warranty.  i had put some red epoxy alignment dots on my fly rod before it broke, and was told by the sales rep to take the epoxy off before sending it in otherwise they'd void it"
878490,aplumma,2014-10-27 21:34:00,6896,I don't know if a rod that was nicked is a warrentee issue. It is not a defect in the rod it is damage done to the rod. Send a P.M. to Spiel and see if he has some advise on the best way to reinforce the rod he is an excellent builder with loads of knowledge.    Art
878527,jackz905,2014-10-28 03:54:00,6,k i will contact the dealer and see if any modification will void the warrenty as i also want to tie a hook holder on above the cork because it doesnt have one
