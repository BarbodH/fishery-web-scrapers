878917,captpierre,2014-10-31 20:09:00,2521,Might not be a dock
878918,Raf,2014-10-31 20:14:00,3495,is there ever a dock there?  i've only used it in the fall and don't recall ever seeing one.
878942,JoshS,2014-10-31 23:26:00,729,Dock was there last Sunday... Not sure how long it stays in.
878947,fishindevil,2014-10-31 23:54:00,6254,I was by there yesterday .... And although I didn't directly look for it I'm not sure it was there ? Hmmm .... He usually pulls it out around this time anyways but you can launch there no problem without it !!!! Good luck  it might be icy there in the morning
