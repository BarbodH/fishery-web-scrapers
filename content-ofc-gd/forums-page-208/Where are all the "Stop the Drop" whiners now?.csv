878614,irishfield,2014-10-29 02:48:00,26272,"Been on the Bay for over 32 years now, tried to tell those that would listen it was cyclic ! 100's of thousands of dollars spent on ""what do we do"" meetings, in every Georgian Bay town and city, and nature took care of it on it's own."
878615,irishfield,2014-10-29 02:57:00,26272,"Nov 2007 level. Note the bumper board below the dock.. off the bow of the boat. This board is now over 4"" below the water. Level is up 2.5 feet since 2007. Back to about normal... the ramp to the floating dock is now uphill !"
878617,OhioFisherman,2014-10-29 03:31:00,6623,Photoshop?
878618,irishfield,2014-10-29 03:36:00,26272,"Nope.. no illusions here! Same docks in both pictures, you can see the ramp to the floating dock in the first picture and note it's up hill now.  Here's a shot when I plowed the ramp in Dec 2009.."
878621,OhioFisherman,2014-10-29 04:05:00,6623,"LOL Wayne, I don't see any rabbits."

878626,Terry,2014-10-29 09:02:00,14456,yup lets hope the levels hold for a few years
878627,misfish,2014-10-29 09:50:00,29133,OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH LOOK AT DA BUNNY. DA FURRY LITTLE BUNNY.

878641,AKRISONER,2014-10-29 13:31:00,5558,  My dock needs a bit of work
878651,Rod Caster,2014-10-29 14:41:00,5784,Haha. With the amount of rain we are getting this year they may have the opposite problem in a couple years
878654,fishnsled,2014-10-29 15:01:00,3520,Nice to see mother nature got things sorted out.
878663,OhioFisherman,2014-10-29 17:19:00,6623,"Haha. With the amount of rain we are getting this year they may have the opposite problem in a couple years  Often wondered about that, we set a record for rainfall a couple of years ago, last year a drought, this year, decidedly normal. I don't think the farmers in my area have been able to string together more than two decent years in the 24 years I have been here."
878761,FrankTheRabbit,2014-10-30 13:37:00,479,"Dunno if a solid conclusion can be made by just one season of returning water levels. It's such a huge water system to claim it as a cyclical event and naive to do so. I'm not sure if they've managed to implement a system to slow the outflow of water or perhaps the heavy precipitation from this past winter, but I do hope they are able to find a way to maintain the current water levels of GB and Huron."
878768,musky666,2014-10-30 15:15:00,126,"No doubt that it is cyclical, and looks good for the present, but wherever Men alter the landscape for the 'better' there is the risk of messing up Nature. I don't think it is a bad idea to ask questions, gather data, and be watchful for the benefit of us all."
878770,irishfield,2014-10-30 15:25:00,26272,My wife grew up on Sturgeon Bay... from 1965 on. Her father bought the property with 300 feet of front yard in those years. When I first went there in '82 there was about 80 feet of front yard because the water was so HIGH and everyone was complaining something was wrong on the great lakes. Last year it returned to about the same 300 feet of front yard and everyone was complaining the water was LOW. It's now back to 80 again.
878771,Headhunter,2014-10-30 15:27:00,5703,"It was expected that the levels would rise this year, given that the Great Lakes froze over completely, which eliminated a great deal of winter evaporation. Good to see it come back up. HH"
878809,brw,2014-10-30 20:57:00,101,"Irishfield hope you are right. All I know is that since the mid to late 90's?? or so until this year, seems like they pulled the plug in The Bay. If only we know who ""they"" were!!!"
878848,cram,2014-10-31 02:01:00,1733,Great to see.
878849,cram,2014-10-31 02:04:00,1733,btw - nice boat!!
878860,dave524,2014-10-31 10:08:00,4508,"Lake Ontario is better but still down to when I moved here in 83, I'd say we are still down 18"" to 2 feet from the high water of the 80's."
