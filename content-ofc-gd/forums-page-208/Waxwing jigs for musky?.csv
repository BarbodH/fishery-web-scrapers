879065,OhioFisherman,2014-11-01 21:12:00,6623,""" Waxwing Freshwater version performs the best with new Tranx reel, Compre Musky rod and PowerPro Hollow-Ace with Flurocarbon leader. ""   Sounds like they are trying to sell something?"
879097,Fisherpete,2014-11-02 00:57:00,1814,"I threw one for a few minutes that a friend bought, excellent action on it, similar to a Hellhound but you just do a straight retrieve with it. I don't fish glide/jerk baits much but I will probably have one in my box for next season."
