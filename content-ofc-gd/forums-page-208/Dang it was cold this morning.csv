Well it,s   wind that blows the cold that gets to me.It was a coin flip for todays fish.,Steel heading or the toon for some late fall smallies. Winds were not on our side,so we headed for the river. Temps at 5am was -6. I already knew my arthritic hand was going to hate me,but I cant let this stop me from doing what I love to do. Thats fishing. (reminder to self,need more pocket warmers)  Thanks to the camera man for this video,and it was a bonus to see Mike again. I think he had the best idea this morning. Bring the ice hub and heater next time. LOL Ya we laughed about it,but it might just happen.  YES THERE IS BACK GROUND IN THE VIDEO MR.BILL.  This is the first colored buck I have gotten. Sure was pretty.       "

879180,misfish,2014-11-02 20:10:00,29133,The sound of the line drawing through the iced up guides was nerving Rick.   I just peeled of 60 ft of line and retied for my Monday outing. Their calling for warmer temps.

879210,BillM,2014-11-02 22:31:00,17367,That's quite the coloured up buck for this time of year!  Nice fish man.  It was a frosty one this morning that's for sure.
879238,kickingfrog,2014-11-03 01:36:00,8333,T'was. Even in the sun.  
879241,MJL,2014-11-03 01:58:00,2427,I think next time I will try my new net poking technique on your fish...It involves poking the net at the fish and leader without actually scooping it up...I'm sure it would've saved you from getting your hands wet and cold  Next time you can bring your pop up hut and heater along with your pontoon. You can anchor up in the middle of the river with your fish finder transducer and Terry and I could fish inside your heated hut and watch steelhead chase our baits like lakers on the LCD
879247,miller,2014-11-03 03:56:00,223,"I have that same net, perfect for the rivers, a little tight when you get the real long fish but haven't lost one yet because of it!"
879273,Christopheraaron,2014-11-03 14:12:00,3525,Nice fish! I want to see Mike's pics!
