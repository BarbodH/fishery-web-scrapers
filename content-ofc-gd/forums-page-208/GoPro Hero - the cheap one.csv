878262,Burtess,2014-10-25 20:09:00,901,I got a couple hundred buckaroos for my birthday so I am looking at a GoPro Hero.  This is the new one without all the bells and whistles of the higher models.  It goes for $150.  This will allow me to get a clamp mount or a head mount as well.  http://shop.gopro.com/compare?category=cameras  Am I going to miss the swappable battery or the lack of BacPac accessories?  Advise from the GoPro literate?  Thanks!!!  Burt

878476,Craigson,2014-10-27 20:25:00,117,Battery life is about 1.5 hours when filimg 1080p. Atleast thats what i read and have experienced so far. I think im gonna bite the bullet and buy the battery bacpac. Not too fond of changing batteries in the middle of a stream or lake.
