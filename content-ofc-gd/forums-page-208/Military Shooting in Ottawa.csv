878437,fish_fishburn,2014-10-27 17:26:00,1311,The word terrorism is used rather loosely now days. I guess its for a better impact. Why hasn't there been any mention of the colossal failure of security on the hill.  Whoever is in charge of security  should be removed from that position. There is no way in my opinion that guy should of ever got as far as he did. Maybe our military should put a system in place and have the RCMP execute it to the T or do it themselves. Just a thought.

A statement hopefully has been very loud and clear to all terrorist organizations. Yes we as Canadians are passive and try too be politically correct; but you are not going to step past the line of our breaking point, not without suffering the consequences. Lets hope that this tragedy has helped people remember out National anthem, especially this line. O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.

We don't always get along even amongst the closest of pals but you bet we will stand on guard for thee. Thousands of strangers lined on highways is a testament to that. You want to break us? You will fail. ISIS is not welcome in Canada nor any other terrorist organization. To my fellow anglers think of understanding and acceptance over tolerance. we all have different histories and experiences, different beliefs, God or Darwin, jig versus drop shot, crank versus spinner, troll or cast, carp or musky we should be practicing more acceptance and understanding here and in our daily lives.

Hats off to those who took the time to line the overpasses and highway to pay their respects.  It sent a healthy shiver down my spine.  I know when my parents came to Canada in '52 from war torn Europe, they adapted and embraced what was here to flourish and do well.  Nowadays, it's become a real head shaker.  I'm of firm belief, you come here and adapt, you don't have to throw away your previous heritage, but don't try to make it another country. Its a power struggle. Good vs Evil. Simple as that."

She said it was unbelievably touching to see the respect being shown to the fallen soldier from so many hundreds of total strangers and is something she'll never forget.  Our Remembrance Day services in a couple weeks will be a little bit different this year.  I've always been extremely proud to be a Canadian and even more so when the country comes together like it has this week to honor our military.  I just hope the soldier that was murdered in Quebec the day before is receiving the same type of recognition as the one that died in Ottawa, but for some reason I'm just not hearing much about him on the news."
878244,ch312,2014-10-25 16:01:00,1590," I just hope the soldier that was murdered in Quebec the day before is receiving the same type of recognition as the one that died in Ottawa, but for some reason I'm just not hearing much about him on the news.  This is troubling me as well. Is it simply because the soldier in Quebec was an older gentleman while the soldier who was shot in Ottawa was a young and attractive man? It's a known fact that people are more emotional about the death of a younger man and I think the media is playing this to get more Canadians to react.   I simply cannot understand how or why the shooting of the soldier in Ottawa is more significant than the soldier in Montreal being run over. In both cases a Canadian soldier was murdered on our home turf and both deserve equal recognition."
878247,lew,2014-10-25 16:31:00,12766,"My guess is the shooting in Ottawa is getting the most attention simply because of where it took place, right at the Cenotaph, a place so sacred to most Canadians, while the soldier in Quebec was just in a parking lot.  I also think it's the same with the Sergeant at Arms being hailed as a hero for killing the punk, while the cop who killed the Quebec coward doesn't even have his name mentioned by the press.  It's unfortunate things happen this way, but it is what it is.  This is all just my opinion though."
878254,woodenboater,2014-10-25 18:32:00,2277,The Ottawa situation is receiving more coverage because firstly - it was in Ottawa and therefore more media attention and secondly - the gunman went to Parliament Hill after shooting Cirillo. Take away the Hill and it's still important but not as far reaching.  I don't believe it had anything to do with age but more the circumstances of how they died and the entirety of the events.
878255,Canuck2fan,2014-10-25 18:57:00,1444,"The reason the shootings in Ottawa seem to be getting so much attention comparatively to what happened in Quebec can probably be explained, by the fact that EVERY news corp has staff in Ottawa.  As for the police officer not being named in Quebec that might be his choice or his superiors choice as he\they might be worried what some other nutbar will do to his family, if his name got out?"
878256,wallyboss,2014-10-25 19:04:00,1095,"I completely agree with you Lew.  Every post that I see on my Facebook that only mentions the soldier in Ottawa I make sure to post that there was 2 soldiers killed this week. Not sure why it is happening this way, but it is kind of frustrating. My son is in the Armed Forces in Gagetown N.B. as a combat engineer which might be the reason I take it more at heart, but they were both innocent victims and they should both be remembered because they were victims only because they wore a uniform that every Canadian should be proud of."

They may have acted alone, but the idea of a massive attack is no longer a popular form of terrorism now. We can expect more and more lone wolf attacks. There were 3 attacks in 4 days, Quebec, Ottawa and NYC. All three people responsible are extremist supporters. It's more than just a coincidence  In terms of race, it's not an issue anymore. We have one white, one black and one middle eastern.... An ISIS is operating out of Mexico too so we will see Hispanic as well. Lone wolfs are hard to spot, especially when they are converts  And again I think the lack of info in the Quebec incident is because of the on going investigation. The issue in Ottawa is covered by the RCMP, they have dofferent rules. Quebec operates under their own version of the SIU so I think that has something to do with it.  I also think the attack in Ottawa is getting more coverage because it happened in Ottawa and the suspect stormed parliament. In comparison the pentagon attacks and the flight downed in Pennsylvania got less coverage than the planes that hit the towers. The media goes with the more popular story.

To see armed personnel at the airport and the bank is acceptable and has been for years. With the changes in the world climate we have to broaden the places that we guess is the target for terrorism such as major financial, political, monuments as well as places that if attacked will make the most spectacular news. Terrorism is about instilling terror not about damaging a specific place or person for the most part. The choice of the attack in Canada was to violate a sacred place not about killing SAA Vickers. Outrage is what I feel at this attack because it has struck at the foundation of a society that is close to me. Much has been taken away from the citizens of Canada and I do not nor do I suggest how Canada should react to this issue because I do not have to pay the price of the action taken. The US has changed since 911 for the most part we have continued to be able to have a normal semi safe life from terrorism but at the cost of billions of dollars and a loss of our innocents. It is a dirty road that we travel and it sickens me to see another country have to make the hard decisions that are being forced on you. I grew up with a society that finds it o.k. to show our claws when needed and to fight for what we feel is correct.

878162,Jds63,2014-10-24 17:48:00,1365,"Wow, ""Ignorant"" for a spelling mistake (and you couldn't even copy it correctly) that is a bit extreme perhaps some might even say radical! And you have the audacity to call me ignorant?  I do believe we have been far too tolerant of others customs and costumes!  Just a few examples:  We have changed our laws so that Sikhs can wear their turbans in the RCMP, they don’t have to wear a helmet while riding a motorcycle and they are allowed to wear their Kirpan in most public places in Canada.  How many changes or concessions have we made to Canadian customs or laws to accommodate the wearing of the burka or hijab? The list is long.  We have removed our Christian religious symbols, from most public places because they might offend someone, a Christmas tree for Christ sake; if it offends you go back to where ever you came from. Christianity is the foundation that this country and our values were built on. We are supposed to be tolerant of others but they don’t need to be tolerant of us?   As for a solution to the problem we face today:  Well, first of all when he wanted to leave Canada and go fight with ISIS, they should have let him go, in fact the remaining 90 or so that are still within Canada should be put on a plane and sent over there. That is when their passports should have been seized so that once out of Canada they would have no way to get back into the country.  You want to go and fight a religious war by all means go and fight like a man! Don’t hide here in Canada like a coward and think that because you can kill someone who is unarmed and protecting your rights and freedoms you are some kind of a hero.  I like to visit this place to read about my favorite past time : fishing  But in light of what happened in Ottawa I clicked on this thread and began reading the posts.

As I write this it still bothers me because it reminds me of the racism I noticed growing up even though being born in Canada. First of all I don’t understand how you are connecting Sikhs and turbans and Christmas trees with what recently happened. I can only think that for you ….  its hard to identify a white French Canadian with mental illness that becomes self radicalized and decides to kill people. But people wearing turbans must be to blame for all this including having no Christmas trees on display…. LOL (BTW Jewish people don’t celebrate Christmas) lets blame them as well.  I am proud to be Canadian and I will defend the rights that come with being Canadian. We have a Charter of Rights and Freedoms and that’s what makes our Country great… that’s what our soldiers fight for ….  Don’t paint everyone a terrorist because of what they look like.

I am sorry that you read my post as being a racist hate mongerer, again if you did know me you would know that this couldn’t be further from the truth and that I am always quick to stand up for the rights of others and offer a helping hand to anyone!  I am disappointed and yes perhaps even upset that we consistently seem to be having to give up our religious symbols and customs to appease others. All the while we are expected to just accept that they have a right to exercise theirs.  What about the rights of me and my family, my kids and grand kids.  I think it has gone a little too far when a school can’t even display words like “Christmas” or “Halloween”. When a Christmas tree can’t be displayed in a public place because it could offend someone who is not Christian or a crucifix can’t be worn openly but other nationalities religious symbols can.  You are free to have your opinion, this is Canada but I think that very soon we are going to have to stand up and demand equality! If we don’t, it won’t be long before this won’t be the Canada I was born in and served proudly as a member of the RCRs.

Hats off to those who took the time to line the overpasses and highway to pay their respects.  It sent a healthy shiver down my spine.  I know when my parents came to Canada in '52 from war torn Europe, they adapted and embraced what was here to flourish and do well.  Nowadays, it's become a real head shaker.  I'm of firm belief, you come here and adapt, you don't have to throw away your previous heritage, but don't try to make it another country."

I can tell you in the same breath that 1 in 10 people have the knowledge/training and the weapons on themselves all of the time to kill you. It is why I caution people to not make ideal threats on this forum. Personally I like that you do not know who the 1 in 10 are it keeps people honest in my opinion. Kind of like putting a sign in a watermelon patch that one of the watermelons has been poisoned to keep theft down. I do not want to detract/derail this post of this horrific act that happened in Canada.

878081,pics,2014-10-24 01:22:00,1268,Nathan was with his best buddy doing a ceremonial guarding of the war memorial. It's a great honour to get to do this.. the shooter was a coward who shot him from an angle that he wouldn't have seen him from..even if he had a loaded rifle there was no chance to defend himself. The  people who stepped in to help not even thinking of their own safety need to be commended as well. There were a lot of real Canadian heros that I saw in action yesterday and I'm glad to live in a country where people aren't afraid to step up to help.. there is a huge outpouring of support for the families involved in both tragedies.. Nathans son hangs around the gym where my daughter has gymnastics due to the fact that his mom is a coach there. Every time I see him it will remind me to be vigilant in protecting Canadian values.. Nathan' s buddy who was with him when he died learned about serving others from his father who worked at stelco... the community and the country will stand beside anyone who makes the ultimate sacrifice.... a group from the mosque in Hamilton came to lay flowers at the armory and to condemn the attack along with hundreds of others. Mt Albion falls will be lit up with red lights Friday night in his honor starting at 7.. The Canadian heros website and Facebook page has info on how to donate to the soldiers who lost their lives this week...

The misconceptions of the internet has lead Canadians to believe that we have armed people open carry in public is just not true. I was attempting to alleviate the fear that some have displayed that your country becoming a militant state with people on the street corner is miles behind the US on that road which has not even been close to starting here.  While I have a great deal of contact with Canada I do not follow the politics of your country I have my hands full trying to watch mine. lol  I will state here that what is considered good or right or fair in the US might be poison for my friends up North that I know. The path that your county chooses will be chosen by the government and the people of Canada after weighing the repercussions of their actions.

At no point did I say I had a problem with a policeman wearing a turban, all I was pointing out is that we have made many concessions to our laws, traditions, and way of life to accommodate others religions, beliefs and choices.    It seems we are expected to be tolerant of others but we are also expected to freely give up our rights, customs, and beliefs so that we might not offend them. It has to be a two way street, you want my respect, you respect me too.

What would have happened if they didn't take on middle east names and were indeed pissed off tax payers? Would that have made us feel any better? I willing to say yes most likely.. I don't have answers just more and more questions. I do think with this latest attacks on our freedom, our government is about to slowly start hacking away at those rights and freedoms. These men were indeed Canadians. Our federal government knew about them both and about 90 more of them..If they need to change our ways and cut back on some of our freedom and rights, i say start with them. Go pick every one of them up, every one that has pubicly threatened Canada. If your passport has been revolked and your a suspected terrorist your guilty untill proven otherwise.

It was done like that to appease the liberals fear of our military having real bullets in public. We did carry blanks though. Usually only issued 5 blanks per person and a bayonette.  Of course things could have changed in the last 15 years but who knows.  Would it have mattered realistically if he had of had a 30 round magazine of ball ammo with one stuffed down the chamber? I really don't know. I wasn't there. I am not saying he shouldn't have had real ammo. I just don't know if it would have made a difference. One thing that I do find VERY disturbing is that he was alone. A single soldier in public is a very easy target and is very vulnerable. Especially given they don't have live ammunition. If there was two soldiers with ammunition. Its possible this would have never happened to begin with and if so something could possibly have been done right at that moment. Even if all it was that first aid be applied immediately. Everyone in the armed forced in Canada undergoes emergency battle first aid that could have been applied seconds after. Of course there are many flipsides to this like, a gun fight in the streets between the second soldier possibly injuring others, or having two soldiers down. One thing I can say for certain, neither myself nor ANY Canadian soldier I know or knew would not have given up anything in the world to have been there standing beside him even if they fully knew this would happen and there life could have also been taken."

I do believe we have been far too tolerant of others customs and costumes!  Just a few examples:  We have changed our laws so that Sikhs can wear their turbans in the RCMP, they don’t have to wear a helmet while riding a motorcycle and they are allowed to wear their Kirpan in most public places in Canada.  How many changes or concessions have we made to Canadian customs or laws to accommodate the wearing of the burka or hijab? The list is long.  We have removed our Christian religious symbols, from most public places because they might offend someone, a Christmas tree for Christ sake; if it offends you go back to where ever you came from. Christianity is the foundation that this country and our values were built on. We are supposed to be tolerant of others but they don’t need to be tolerant of us?   As for a solution to the problem we face today:  Well, first of all when he wanted to leave Canada and go fight with ISIS, they should have let him go, in fact the remaining 90 or so that are still within Canada should be put on a plane and sent over there. That is when their passports should have been seized so that once out of Canada they would have no way to get back into the country.

Because they were ""different"" they were interned during WWII.  They were painted with one brush stroke as enemies because they ""looked"" like them.  They were in fact Canadian citizens.  Anyhow...this has been a terrible tragedy no matter who did it and what beliefs the shooter had.  What's important now is how we respond.  We are strong.  We won't let this make us cower in fear.

It needs to have good grounds to interfere in individual lives. So that means every now and then, somebody, somewhere, somehow may slip through the cracks.""

877887,manitoubass2,2014-10-22 18:10:00,11391,
877888,Whopper,2014-10-22 18:15:00,2174,For some reason I can't quote/reply.  mantiuobass2 I can only repeat what the media has said and that was US Intelligence had intercepted a threat from an outside source levied against your fine country and reported it. Too many crazies out there to speculate at this time exactly where the threats are coming from.  EDIT ADD: I hope who ever is responsible pay dearly
877892,BillM,2014-10-22 18:49:00,17367,"Do you guys think the level of response is enough? I have a feeling like if this was in the US that planes would be grounded etc... I wonder what sort of information is out there? Hopefully this is not the prelude to something larger.  They didn't ground planes in Boston..  I dunno why they'd do it for something like this.    Look at the guy who hopped the fence at the Whitehouse and made it in...   So much for security, lol."
877895,bigbuck,2014-10-22 19:00:00,2449,"Unfortunately, the Bull going on in the Middle East is finally showing itself here. The nutbar in Quebec running down a couple soldiers, now this.... if it is indeed connected somehow, we as Canadians just witnessed the end of our normal peaceful life here at home. In the US, every time you travel you remember 911 with all the security and heavily armed police everywhere. I for one do not want to see a police officer on every corner armed with a C8 or sub machine gun. I hope that is not the road that we are going to travel down now."
877896,manitoubass2,2014-10-22 19:05:00,11391,Now I see on cbc they have bomb detectors being rigged up. Must be checking every possible situation
877897,kickingfrog,2014-10-22 19:08:00,8333,Never make decisions based on anger.
877901,doubleheader,2014-10-22 19:18:00,497,"A very sad day. Wish there were answers, I'm afraid there are none. The only thing we can all count on is there will be more terrorist events in the future."
877902,manitoubass2,2014-10-22 19:36:00,11391,Any word on the city worker that seen a suspect escape in a police/or aid vehicle?
877906,moxie,2014-10-22 19:59:00,1566,The only thing that is surprising to me is that it took this long. Doesnt matter whether it is borne out of religious ideology or not it is evil and has finally reared its ugly head. Placing blame will be the way of the fool. Wonder how and how much things will change from now on. Oh Canada how we better pull our self absorbed heads out of our asses and stand on guard for thee.  Very sad and interesting indeed.
877908,jedimaster,2014-10-22 20:29:00,3472,Saying now that the dead gunman was Michael Zehaf-Bibeau age 34 Canadian born.  Some more info here including picture... http://heavy.com/news/2014/10/michael-zehaf-bibeau-ottawa-parliament-shooting-terro-attack/
877909,manitoubass2,2014-10-22 20:31:00,11391,and now talk about guns and security of parliament
877911,ketchenany,2014-10-22 20:35:00,3229,"Today is a sad day for Canada and for me personally. I sit here rembering why my parents came here; for a better life 60 years ago! I took a day off work to help my wife help her with dental surgery, not good, but how many can say that in Canada it's available! Good hard working people! I also follow Wayne's tread another true Canadian with a struggle to overcome!  Hopefully this is an isolated case and it goes away but it won't.  I have not served in any military capacity, but have a son in law who has.  Lets's take our country back, after this investigation is complte and not make assumptions on who do it yet."
877841,Fisherman,2014-10-22 15:03:00,7201,"Another disgusting moment, time to turn the tide."
877842,mattybculp,2014-10-22 15:24:00,388,just turned on the cbc. wonder what the hell is going on there !
877843,mattybculp,2014-10-22 15:24:00,388,1 confirmed kill inside parliament
877844,tb4me,2014-10-22 15:25:00,3295,this is horrible..just horrible..
877845,tb4me,2014-10-22 15:25:00,3295,reports of multiple gunmen..if this is ISIS we have major problems here...
877846,BillM,2014-10-22 15:26:00,17367,There's one gunman..  and he's dead.  (Let's at least hope this is the case!!!!)
877847,fishing n autograph,2014-10-22 15:31:00,2540,"No there's 2, 1 is dead the other is still active"
877848,mattybculp,2014-10-22 15:31:00,388,apparently could be multiple gunmen
877849,tb4me,2014-10-22 15:32:00,3295,cbc is reporting there is 2 or 3 shooters and one is dead..One fleeing on foot and one on a motorbike..again Re CBC
877850,mattybculp,2014-10-22 15:34:00,388,What kind of a coward shoots a soldier guarding the tomb of the unknown soldier. Pathetic.
877851,BillM,2014-10-22 15:34:00,17367,Let's hope they take out the rest of them the same way they did guy #1.
877852,tb4me,2014-10-22 15:39:00,3295,Let's hope they take out the rest of them the same way they did guy #1. Let Canadian women do it with pride too..If this is ISIS this is just the beginning..
877853,BillM,2014-10-22 15:42:00,17367,Why would it be ISIS?   That's jumping on the bandwagon a little soon don't ya think?
877856,mattybculp,2014-10-22 15:54:00,388,"yeah I'm not jumping on any band wagon yet either, I will wait and see what the ""reports"" say. What I do think is that we as country need to be a little more vigilant. A lot of people believe it cant happen to us, until it does, and then we will take appropriate measures."
877857,tb4me,2014-10-22 16:02:00,3295,"thats why I said ""if"" key word if..And why wouldnt it be? gun man had his head covered in a black and white scarf or turban.Surely this isint a group of ticked off tax payers..."
877858,leaf4,2014-10-22 16:08:00,2466,"Crazy to hear of this happening, especially on the heels of that guy running down the military member in the streets yesterday, as to ""why"" it could be ISIS should be blatantly clear lol  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/islamic-state-followers-urged-to-launch-attacks-against-australians  Quote from the article  If you can kill a disbelieving American or European  especially the spiteful and filthy French  or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other disbeliever from the disbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way however it may be, said al-Adnani.  Do not ask for anyones advice and do not seek anyones verdict. Kill the disbeliever whether he is civilian or military, for they have the same ruling. Both of them are disbelievers."
877859,BillM,2014-10-22 16:08:00,17367,"thats why I said ""if"" key word if..And why wouldnt it be? gun man had his head covered in a black and white scarf or turban. Surely this isint a group of ticked off tax payers...  No one knows who these guys are, that's why we should probably wait before declaring we're being attacked my ISIS or some other radical group."
877860,Fisherman,2014-10-22 16:10:00,7201,Looks like the Sargeant at Arms plugged one of them..excellent.  He gets a medal.
877861,Lape0019,2014-10-22 16:10:00,647,It's pretty crazy up here. All of the buildings in the downtown core are locked down...
877862,BillM,2014-10-22 16:11:00,17367,Looks like the Sargeant at Arms plugged one of them..excellent.  He gets a medal.  From the video it sounds like that guy was pumped full of lead.
877864,4x4bassin,2014-10-22 16:38:00,1025,It's a sad day for all Canadians when someone shoots one of our own standing guard at the tomb of the unknown soldier .
877866,tb4me,2014-10-22 16:44:00,3295,It's a sad day for all Canadians when someone shoots one of our own standing guard at the tomb of the unknown soldier . he is a Hamilton man..Disgusting hope he makes a full recovery...
877868,4x4bassin,2014-10-22 16:48:00,1025,"Yes , Disgusting !!!!"
877869,bare foot wader,2014-10-22 16:54:00,1354,"disgusting, hope they all get mags emptied, and tax payers don't pay for their standard of life in jail....but pretty big coincidence this happens the day after we send 6 jets to the middle east  I heard there was a third shooting at the rideau centre?"
877870,muskymatt,2014-10-22 17:03:00,2608,Sad day for Ottawa and Canada!
