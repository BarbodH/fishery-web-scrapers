878551,solopaddler,2014-10-28 14:52:00,8605,"There are many, many lakes that have rivers running into them though. I can think of 3 places that ive been, that I can drive to, that are open all year.  For all I know these were poached OOS, im just saying there are places where it is legal.....no need for you guys to jump on him.  S. Unless it's the one open river in zone 15 then it's not open all year, and nobodies jumping on anyone.  Where does the OP say it was in a river/creek? Is it based on the background in the pics? Or are the pics georeferenced? To me, it looks like a lake.  Jon Take a look at the 2nd pic.  I don't think anyone is jumping on bowslayer101. He is always providing content to this and other sites and seems to have big shoulders! Most just don't want him getting in hot water. Those are some great looking fish and I hope he has his own honey hole.  Exactly!"
878554,BowSlayer101,2014-10-28 15:12:00,296,"it was a mouth of a river and it takes quite a bit of bushwalking to get to, i doubt many if any on here know where it is, its a little back lake, its open i have checked several times, thanks for the compliments though!"
878557,misfish,2014-10-28 15:37:00,29133,"Mouth of a river.   Nice fish and thanks .  Now don't some of ya,s feel like a total shmucks? LOL"
878561,Tim Mills,2014-10-28 16:17:00,476,A lot of internet CO's in this thread.  S.  LOL.  Well done Bow Slayer. Looking forward to the Carp and Catfish reports.
878567,bare foot wader,2014-10-28 16:53:00,1354,"nice fish  I think you best post the lake/river mouth, along with detailed directions, so we can all confirm the regs, just looking out for board members eh"
878573,jimmer,2014-10-28 18:07:00,2730,He should be sharing after all the advice that was given to him on this thread! LOL Maybe a meet and greet in the bush.
878582,davey buoy,2014-10-28 20:59:00,5505,"People are quick to think the out of season part,agreed the op seems to know what he's up to.The advice in confirming I'm also sure was welcome.Good for you!!!!Now enjoy a little more !!  ."
878631,BowSlayer101,2014-10-29 11:31:00,296,"lol, thanks guys, Tim, I'm getting there, haha."
878632,porkpie,2014-10-29 11:42:00,2521,"How bout we let the posters worry about their locations and legalities!  Only one time have I ever let someone know that they may have been outside the lanes here. Turns out I was right, and he was blissfully ignorant, thanked me for it, and it was no big deal.  Because I did it all by PM.  Just a thought folks!"
878400,BowSlayer101,2014-10-27 09:46:00,296,"Had the chance to get out for a long awaited speck trip yesterday, managed around 30 specks and a few nice bass, lost a monster of a bass as well, brought home a few specks and some bass for a fish fry too! Hopefully ill be out there again before the weekend!"
878402,Joeytier,2014-10-27 10:07:00,3990,"Nice fish, but I've never heard of year-round creek specs"
878407,BillM,2014-10-27 12:48:00,17367,.
878410,kenzy31,2014-10-27 13:06:00,261,^^^^^ what he said.
878420,solopaddler,2014-10-27 14:56:00,8605,Have a look at zone 18 guys.
878427,kenzy31,2014-10-27 16:32:00,261,Whoops! I apologize for my ignorance. Thanks for the lesson Mike.  And to the OP...NICE SPECKS! Sorry for the misunderstanding.
878428,BillM,2014-10-27 16:34:00,17367,"Yup, I'll edit my previous post as well!  Nice specs kid!"
878435,solopaddler,2014-10-27 16:59:00,8605,"Assuming of course the young lad was in zone 18, nice specks!"
878441,BillM,2014-10-27 18:11:00,17367,LOL!
878445,manitoubass2,2014-10-27 18:21:00,11391,Hahahahaha
878448,BowSlayer101,2014-10-27 18:32:00,296,"Thanks guys! Also, zone 15 extended season"
878451,Musky or Specks,2014-10-27 18:40:00,2710,I'm not saying anything
878454,BillM,2014-10-27 18:49:00,17367,I'm not saying anything  LOL!  I would probably make a phone call to a CO and ask about that specific river/creek.  I have a feeling it won't be the answer you suspected.
878460,jimmer,2014-10-27 19:10:00,2730,I would heed the advice of BillM. I don't see any exceptions for creeks or rivers in FMZ 15. I think most here don't want to see you in any hot water.
878463,solopaddler,2014-10-27 19:21:00,8605,Zone 15? Careful what you post online son.
878465,fishnsled,2014-10-27 19:28:00,3520,There are a ton of lakes in Zone 15 open for specks and lakers all year long.  I guess we don't know all the areas we fish all that well with regards to the rules and regs.  Myself included.  http://files.ontario.ca/environment-and-energy/fishing/mnr_e001334.pdf  Some nice fish there Bowslayer101

878480,misfish,2014-10-27 20:41:00,29133,Could be the mouth of a river????

The kid was fishing in a river. There's not ""lots"" of year round rivers in zone 15, in fact there is only one. If the OP was fishing in that one very specific river then he has my apologies.  Like someone said earlier no one wants to see him get in trouble!"
878506,Musky or Specks,2014-10-27 22:38:00,2710,It's there fella's I owe him an apology and now I have a place to fish after Sept 30. Some nice specks there man.
