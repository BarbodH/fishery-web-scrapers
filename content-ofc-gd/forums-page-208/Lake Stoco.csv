I've never been so I wouldn't mind some help with info on accommodations, launch, and of course, a plan of attack.  I heard the island next to town is a good place along with where the moira river exits to the north.  Now I've never fished an exit before.. always a feeder which make more sense to me..lol  Any and all help is appreciated.  I'd also be willing to take a passenger if your a serious ski hunter....

Rates are good $70 bucks a night taxes in. 613-478-2326 Fish around the islands there are only 3 and also where the river exits my dad got a 50""er there years ago. Fishing is sometimes tough ..... sometimes easy. Great little lake produces big fish!"
878940,KraTToR,2014-10-31 23:15:00,506,Thanks for the info.  Leaving early and I'll let you know how it went.  Hopefully I'll have some pics..lol
