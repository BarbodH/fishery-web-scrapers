878414,Fishwilly,2014-10-27 14:20:00,206,In the process of buying new F150 and always had my father in law who's retired from Ford that gave me a pin for discount. However he isn't well and I really don't want to bother him so.....I'm wondering if anyone here works at or knows someone that is a Ford employee that can get one. It would be really appreciated and would knock a couple grand off the price of the truck.  Cheers
878434,John,2014-10-27 16:58:00,2956,I used to get X plan papers or A plan papers from my contacts. Found that with discounts offered on trucks in recent years I could do at least as well if not better without them. Car Cost Canada is your friend.
878442,Fishwilly,2014-10-27 18:13:00,206,All I know is dealer ran the numbers and said if I could get Ford pin he'd take 2k off.
878444,BillM,2014-10-27 18:17:00,17367,So you should change your post and offer up a few bucks to that Ford employee to make it worth his time
878511,Dave Jones,2014-10-27 23:04:00,50,"Your best bet would be to get a pin# from your father in law, it will save you more than a couple of grand. I got my brother in Law an A plan # and it saved him over 8K...also get yourself a Costco membership and that will knock another $1000 off the price. Shop around you will be surprised how much some dealerships will give you for a trade in. The price they knock off for your trade in also cancels out that much more in the tax you pay."
878518,Fishwilly,2014-10-28 00:12:00,206,thanks everyone for the advise/help. A fellow ofc member is arranging a pin for me. Much appreciated.  Cheers
