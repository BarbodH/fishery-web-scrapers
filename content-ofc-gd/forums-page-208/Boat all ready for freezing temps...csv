125029,irishfield,2007-10-19 22:50:00,26272,"Got to thinking about the livewells and power wash pump and realized that even if I blew/vacuumed them out, a trip on the lake would have water finding the pumps/low spots in the hoses and the power wash intake screen/pump filling with water. Fine in most cases when you are on the water...but the trailering home would freeze things and possibly bust things.  First I vacuumed/blew out the recir pump in each livewell. Then I removed the intake screens from the transom and attached a 1"" rubber hose and a funnel. Turned the bow live well fill pump on and added plumbing antifreeze until it spit out clean into the livewell. Then turned on my power wash and ran it, feeding in more antifreeze, until it came out consistantly pink. Same deal with rear livewell. All the antifreeze that drained out the livewell drains and intakes when I removed the hose was caught in a bucket. This antifreeze was then dumped into the boat hull bilge to take care of that small amount of water that never leaves the hull from rain.  I then put the plugs in the livewells and added a bit of antifreeze to each. Mainly the rear one is my concern as it's drain plug level is exactly freeboard water level..so if you leave the plug out it gets a shallow layer of water in it.  I then teflon taped the pump inlets and installed 3/4"" NPT caps on each of them to keep the water out...I hope.  I also filled a 16oz spray bottle with antifreeze. This is for in the boat to spray the rod locker lid seat and bow deck hatches so they don't freeze down from condensation...... that is very heavy in the fall with the water temp higher than the outside temp.

125041,irishfield,2007-10-19 23:46:00,26272,Nah...we're gonna eat'm all Bud !
125042,Dano,2007-10-19 23:51:00,719,"Mmmmmmmmm, not fillets, we'll steak those hogs!!"
125043,Rizzo,2007-10-19 23:54:00,4754,"WOW!  I just leave everything open...water expands when freezing and heads out the easiest way.  Oh well, I guess both ways work!  Call me lazy but its worked every year.  Then again, I only fish until mid december, not through the nasty cold of january and february"
125046,irishfield,2007-10-20 00:02:00,26272,"Just playin it safe Rizzo...took a total of 15 minutes, $6 for the caps and $3.50 worth of antifreeze. No matter what there are low spots in the livewell feed lines that aren't gonna drain completely. If a pump cracks off = boat sunk. The power wash was a $400 item and again if it cracks open = boat sunk. So for $10 (next year will be $3.50!) and 15 minutes of my time...I'll be doin this every year."
125048,Rizzo,2007-10-20 00:06:00,4754,"great, now you have me worried!  I've been ok all the years I've had boats, but maybe I will just toss a bit of antifreeze in there this year...then again, maybe not"
125050,Whopper,2007-10-20 00:18:00,2174,"Thanks Wayne just realized   that I don't have any of the winterizing done on my boat but then again I've never done it until a least December. So I should be good to go unless we get a real good cold snap, then I guess I'll have to teach the son how to do it under my supervision   jeesh this will be interesting.  Cheers"
125059,Ron,2007-10-20 01:03:00,1683,"Great thinking Wayne.  I do some what similar..... I always have a bottle of wind shield washer fluid in the truck with me. Once I pull the boat out of the water, I pour some into each live well. I haven't had a problem yet either. Also, I can still use the live well if need be. (makes for a great urinal in the real cold days)."
125062,Rizzo,2007-10-20 01:05:00,4754," I store my lunch in my livewell...Ron, you are never welcome in my boat"

125134,Jigger,2007-10-20 13:04:00,1237,Good thinking Irishfield. Guess that gives me something to do today.
125137,irishfield,2007-10-20 13:09:00,26272,"Some boats drain well. My glastron livewell was directly above the transom area and all hoses were straight downhill. Other than a bit of water the unit itself held..everything drained on it's own. This one I wasn't gonna take the chance with. The hoses go off the thru hull pumps and then drop a few inches into the hull and one is running ~ 15 feet to the bow..so who knows where all it goes...and the main concern for me was the power wash pump/intake screen chamber/hose/etc.  That said, many boats will be fine just pulling them out on the ramp, I just wasn't gonna take the chance with mine. Your mileage my vary!"

517674,canadadude,2010-11-05 13:21:00,769,so that antifreeze just gets pumped into what ever body of water your fishing????? yuk!!!!!....The MOE would love that
517678,Grimace,2010-11-05 13:40:00,2020,It would be less damage than the exhaust from a boat going through the water.  All the crap that runs through the storm drains go where?   After sewage is treated with a lot nastier stuff than antifreeze where does it go?   The water table.   This is an old post but I think it is a very useful one.  Thanks to irishfield for posting it a couple of years ago.  By bringing this post back up you may have helped some people out.
517685,irishfield,2010-11-05 14:06:00,26272," UMMM it doesn't get pumped into any body of water in my case.. it stays in the boat, hense the capped inlets. Come spring a garden hose gets feed into inlets, pumps turned on and flushed out here in the yard.  Maybe stop by the local marinas and see where the RV antifreeze goes... after they launch the boats! Every cruiser gets the antifreeze treatment. It's only alcohol.. it will evaporate."
517700,canadadude,2010-11-05 14:46:00,769," Cudos to you for flushing it out,Here in St Catharines most boats are flushed out before entering the water in the spring.The MOE was already down there for an antifreeze spill, they were not happy and fortunatly no fines were handed out for the first offence.It's not only alcohol,it's more like glycol and is highly toxic to the enviroment.It may seem like it's really nothing but we should all do our part to keep toxins from being introduced to the enviroment."
517878,aplumma,2010-11-05 23:10:00,6896,"While the Safety Data Sheet is a dry read the use of R.V. Antifreeze is not Highly Toxic and can be diluted and flushed without adverse effects to the environment. The dilution rate of 1 gallon of RV antifreeze diluted to 100 gallons can be consumed  however it would taste bad and you will get gastric distress. It is a chemical that can and will prevent costly damage to engines and plumbing systems with a small impact on the environment in large quantities at this time its advantages far exceed its drawbacks. So use it instead of the toxic Antifreeze used in automotive aplications.  Art   SAFETY DATA SHEET WINTER CARE RV ANTIFREEZE SECTION 1 IDENTIFICATION COMPANY NAME: CHEMICAL SPECIALTIES, INC.
