We almost moved this summer but found alot of issues with the house, which was a huge bummer cause the property was awesome. Now we found a semi secluded house, huge place with a great layout. About 10 acres of land! Nice birdhunting road out the backyard. Pinewood river beside the house leading into rainy river in front of the property. Right at the mouth of LOTW's, and a 20 minute drive from my ice fishing grounds on LOTW's. So stoked, and kids are very happy:)"

878100,manitoubass2,2014-10-24 03:16:00,11391,It also comes with a treehouse:) huge bonus for our kids! We will miss RRFN but had little to no choice. A parting shot as we left the water tonight after catching many walleyes;)
