879225,Fisherman,2014-11-03 00:20:00,7201,"Check the shipping, $8 + another 185 + exchange rate = they better be some darn good. I think you'll be pretty close to $70+"

879279,Dan668,2014-11-03 15:08:00,1120,"Have you tried these?  In trying to find gloves that double for fall and ice fishing.  Considered these,  the kast gloves or wool gloves like listed in the first post."
879280,BillM,2014-11-03 15:11:00,17367,You aren't steelheading with Kast gloves unless you're two handing.
879294,ratherboutdoors,2014-11-03 16:49:00,132,Don't forget that gloves with magnetic clasps will interfere with a compass.
879304,bare foot wader,2014-11-03 18:13:00,1354,"the orvis are pricey, especially after shipping and duty, holding out so far  my old gloves were seriously thick knitted wool, were fairly water resistant and blocked the wind  the magnet on the orvis is an interesting feature, don't use whip out a compass too often fishing, but definitely something to keep in mind  I have seal skinz and kast gloves that I wear with liners, fleece flip overs (not the simms model though), crappy wool fingerless gloves...my old wool flip overs were the best for cold weather, gonna be hard to replace, no clue where I bought them though  the fox river double wool mitts look pretty good and cheaper  http://www.foxsox.com/catalog/product.aspx?type=subcategory&sortorder=stylenumber&code=GLOMT&selectedstyle=9366"

879387,dave524,2014-11-04 09:43:00,4508,"Back in the 80's the mom of one of my steelheading friends was for a fee making/knitting the best glove that I have used. FWIW those gloves had only the thumb and first 2 fingers were half fingered, the ring and little finger were left full. I had no problem with the design using a float reel and spinning gear during cold weather. The wool was of the best quality of course, unfortunately have not seen the friend in many years and I'm sure the mom has passed.  Back in those days I wore the old canvas Columbia Steelheader vest with the wool lined handwarmer pockets at breast height, those gloves and a couple of handwarmers would fish the Niagara all winter."
