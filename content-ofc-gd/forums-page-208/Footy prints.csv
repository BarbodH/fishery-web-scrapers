879265,Rod Caster,2014-11-03 12:43:00,5784,"Great photo boys! So, what other kind of tracks did you see?  I set up the fourth deer stand on my property yesterday. After recently clearing several large fields with a huge excavator, the deer are starting to re-appear, with a particularily high percentage of buck tracks, which is good coz' nobody got a doe tag in our group.Grouse hunting is on hold until our deer hunt is over. Managed to eat two of them of Saturday. Grouse, fiddleeads and perogies! oh ya!  Seeing any rabbits? Those things are delish!"

879269,kickingfrog,2014-11-03 13:09:00,8333,"We saw one lone set of rabbit tracks. All the brown ones must have been staying home.  Porcupine, martin, wolf, deer, moose, vole, white footed mouse, grouse and red squirrel."
