878725,Skud,2014-10-29 23:59:00,739,What an awesome run you are having. Sweet pics
876137,msp,2014-10-10 13:34:00,1336,"It looks as if the boat will be put away a little early this year and the 2014 season will come to a close shortly. Priorities change and parental responsibilities kick into full swing by mid October.Once bass season is underway, thoughts and dreams of flipping a jig and pig clutter my mind. Largemouth love I call it. Everybody has their favorite fish to chase. For me its hunting largemouth.This season was a different season for sure. With the late and unseasonably cold spring, the lakes that I fish seemed quite different than I am used to. Fluctuating water levels and limited weed growth in the places that I usually fish had the fish spread out in not so typical locations. A tough season for big fish this summer for sure.I did fish a few times this fall on solo missions and got out with a couple of non-fishing friends that truly enjoyed just getting out. You know the fishermans saying "" one more spot ? "" Our saying is "" one more lake ? "" It is not uncommon for us to hit 3 or 4 lakes in one day, running and gunning to all of our hotspots.Enjoy a few pics from this fall. Two good ones from a new lake Two good ones from two different lakes that day Another new lake near Kingston A fat largie off a tree Found them under docks that day A nice fatty ( not me ! ) Hero shot !Although Im typically not a Muskie fisherman ( I don't know why ) This fish was the highlight of my fall.As we got closer to the launch at the end of a really tough day, I decided to fish one more spot. A rivermouth with a steep current break. The sun was goingdown and I was throwing a flipping jig into deeper water hoping for a big largemouth. BAM "" fish on ! ""A 46 inch fall fatty fought like mad in the current as my boat spun in circles in a back eddy. drag loosened off on the flipping stick , the fish was hookedperfectly in the snout. A great landing job by my buddy, she was in the boat.Hopefully a couple more trips this year if all goes well. I will report back if any big fish get boated.Thanks for looking !"
876139,Tim Mills,2014-10-10 14:17:00,476,Your reports are always impressive.  Jigging is a technique I need to improve on and try more.
876141,Joey,2014-10-10 14:48:00,9122,Some really nice bass there and awesome bonus musky!!!
876144,Steve,2014-10-10 15:10:00,2075,great fall largies!!! never try deeper cranks in the fall for buckets?  any info on water temps and how they relate to your success?  any fish in shallow once the water reaches the high 50's ?
876145,fishindevil,2014-10-10 15:28:00,6254,some nice fish man !!! well done....tanks....
876146,Sinker,2014-10-10 15:40:00,8692,Nice fish Mike! Love that musky!  S.
876147,buick14,2014-10-10 15:42:00,741,what a awesome year it looks like you had!  good job bud...

876156,Terry,2014-10-10 16:56:00,14456,some fine looking fish there
876159,msp,2014-10-10 17:04:00,1336,"Thanks Guys. I really should try cranks in the fall. From here on we will start to get good largemouth bites on jerkbaits though. Water temps were around 60- 63 degrees. A couple of fish were shallow but the key was that they had deep water close by. Many fish were near their summer spots ( shallow bays ) but they seem be hanging out in the deeper weeds just outside of the shallow bays. 8-10 ft or they were on rocky points adjacent to the shallow bays When the water starts to drop into the 50's typically we will target 8-12 ft depth with suspending jerkbaits, jigs and senkos. During the warm spell we just had in late September the days I went fishing there was little to no wind. Fishing was tough as hell but ended up getting a few good bites instead of numbers ( which is fine with me ) That was the day that I found a good dock bite. also seemed to be holding on deep wood."
876161,AKRISONER,2014-10-10 17:43:00,5558,thanks for the report and insight on the depths of the fish. I am heading out sunday for some bass as well!
876191,Steve,2014-10-10 23:27:00,2075,"truly appreciate the info.  although fishing different waters, I'm going to put some of what you have reported in action this weekend...  will be crankin for bass (with some jerk baits thrown in) this weekend."
876199,msp,2014-10-11 00:46:00,1336,"Steve, I find that the more subtle jerkbaits like husky jerks and rouges work better in the late fall as oposed to the more eratic jerkbaits like x-raps and lucky crafts longer than normal pauses too. Good luck this weekend !"
876526,Moosebunk,2014-10-13 17:00:00,3970,"Good info for some great fall bassin!  Haven't started any sort of bass season yet this year at all, but hope to in the next couple weeks.  Will pack some Husky's and a Rogue and see what happens."
876619,msp,2014-10-14 13:13:00,1336,    Got out for a couple hours with my son this weekend. The kid absolutely smoked them. I couldn't get a bite on the jig. The fish only wanted the senko. On Sunday he boated 13 in 4 hours and I boated 3 On Monday he boated 11 and I boated 4 Here are the 2 biggest. Around 3.5 pounds ?
876641,mepps,2014-10-14 15:20:00,1301,"Killer fall so far, especially that muskie!!"
876661,LucG,2014-10-14 17:36:00,779,Nice report and even better pics!!!!
878456,msp,2014-10-27 18:52:00,1336,Couldn't get out on Saturday due to family obligations. With 30km winds in the forcast and a high of only 8 degrees we knew the bass bite woulkd be shut off.Decided to target pike. Boat control was tougher than normal but the fish were biting well. Boated plenty of pike on jerkbaits.Here are our 2 biggest
878464,NewHips,2014-10-27 19:21:00,111,"Thanks for posting, looks like great Fall fishing."
878537,TDunn,2014-10-28 11:33:00,680,Nice brochettes man!! Good call on targeting some pike!  TDunn
878549,MCTFisher9120,2014-10-28 14:43:00,3761,"Mike nice report man! Those are some really nice buckets man! I love how ""open"" the water is. I am a slop magnet by nature haha but those smallies are a blast. Looks like you got a few of them also!  Thanks for sharing!  MTBF"
878607,Moosebunk,2014-10-28 23:49:00,3970,WoW!!!  Solid pike.
878609,TJC1973,2014-10-29 00:44:00,17,WTG...everyone is a quality fish!
