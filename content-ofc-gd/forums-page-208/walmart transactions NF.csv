That lady probably woulda lost her job   If I say they didn't charge me enough and they say they did, I walk out.  Sorry but it's not my job to convince the stupid, lol.  Bill you may be right. And Manitou, she probably would have lost her job. But amazingly enough, to this day that lady will look shoot us a cold stare and look away like WE did something wrong. I know the owner had a meeting with her at the time but it was hardly my wife's fault. It turned out to be a good case to follow Bill's motto. At least then she's have a reason to be in a snit."
878533,turtle,2014-10-28 10:35:00,274,"I never worry about a big company or bank taking a loss for my gain.  I always worry about the low paid employee who would be in trouble for making a mistake, probably money trouble.  I've returned money to a bank teller and straightened out cashiers.  More likely being over charged than under charged though and I watch for it."

I have always said that I want to be able to walk down any street or into any place and not have to feel ashamed of anything I have done regardless of who I meet. I try very hard to live my life that way, there are times when it has been a struggle but at the end of the day I know I might not be perfect but it sure won't be because I didn't try.  For those that think it is ok to rip off an insurance company or big box store; where do you draw the line? If I have more than you is it ok to rip me off too?  That kind of worries me, if you will take a penny, will you take a dime? If you will take a dime will you take a dollar?  The kind of people I most enjoy spending time with are the ones that are trustworthy. Seems some are, some perhaps not quite up to my way of thinking."

I have corrected mistakes that saw me getting a better deal and I have also done the ""start the car"".  Two best examples. Local hardware store the cashier rang us through for $4.85 for a $485 dollar item. We corrected her...and I hope that young lady never reproduces.  Local Sail. Got an Ice Armour suit for less then half price because the kid in the store gave the cashier the price for a cheap knock off suit that was on the racks right beside the one I bought. That was a start the car moment."

We then head back to the boarded and declare the booze and pay the taxes and duty on the stuff. It works out to be approx 16-18 bucks a bottle cheaper compared to the LCBO store.

I brought it back and the lady at the returns counter looked at me like I had four eyes for bringing it back. Just goes to show how rare it is for people to do the right thing.  My mom would have slapped me silly if she found out I ""stole"" a hamper, even at my age.  Doesn't matter that it's a huge chain store that could undoubtedly handle the kick back from it, you did the right thing and can sleep easy knowing it! Imagine if everybody did this. Maybe they could afford to sell that fishing lure for $1 cheaper, or give that dude who's been stocking shelves for 12 years his long overdue $0.12/hr raise."

So i checked my online bank and it was deducted, but i couldnt get a receipt. I get home and just outta curiousity, check my account. I was accredited the purchase??? Im gonna catch some flack here but i called them and told them i got several hundred dollars worth of stuff for free. Manager was relieved. Anyhow, most probably already do but it never hurts to keep a close eye on your debit transactions. It could easily go the other way. HAGD everyone"

Ive been in school for similar trades to pharmacology, and knew the street value would be well into the $40,000 dollar mark. Crazy.

She was extremely thankful because as she said at the end of her shift she would have had to cough it up out of her own pocket. So transaction mistakes aren't against companies in most cases they are against the overworked cashier, trying to crack out the customers as fast as possible... ( I know Walmart doesn't care about how fast you check out because if they did they would have more than 2 or 3 cashiers working at the 24 checkouts they have sitting there LOL)"
