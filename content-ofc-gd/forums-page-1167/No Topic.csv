101575,lunkerbasshunter,2007-08-07 11:24:00,2585,wow what a great report!  Huge musky!  Cheers!
101582,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-07 11:31:00,0,"What a monster Musky!!!! Do you catch those lakers down rigging, long lining or casting??? Although I hear they are poor fighters, I still want to catch one!"
101634,Raf,2007-08-07 14:17:00,3495," All depends on time of year.  Right now it's downriggers.  In the spring we get 'em off boards, dipseys, casting and long lines.  I think their rep as poor fighters comes from the guys who are trolling with heavy gear for salmon, they are certainly no chinook.  They are a lot of fun on fairly light tackle and they sure do put up a good fight.  They're a powerful fish."
101647,Joey,2007-08-07 14:52:00,9122,Awesome report Raf.  Beauty fish and I love the Osprey pics.  I see you're turning into Black Jacque Shallack again  Joey
