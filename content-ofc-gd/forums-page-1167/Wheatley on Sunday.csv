102124,Chrispy,2007-08-08 16:00:00,168,"Went out of Wheatley with FishTracker (Jerry) on Sunday......  Got up @ 4:00, met up with Jerry at 5:00 and was on the water by 6:00 or so..... and I donâ€™t think we had all 4 rods in the water and we had a bow on.....it was non stop action for most of the day!!  We went 18 for 20 on the bows, a couple of nice walleyes and a ton of sheephead....the coolest part of the day was when we said that we are going to go in around 11:30....just around 11:30 one dipsey went off and one downrigger....double header to end a great day fishing!!!!  We were straight out of the harbour about 3.5 - 4 miles in 50 something feet of water..... Look for the huge bait balls, that is where the fish are!!!! Downrigger balls went 25-30 feet down and dipseys were at 75 feet.....Rainbow and black/white/silver spoons took most of the fish.....  Nice to go out with someone guides, Jerry put us on fish right away and kept us on the fish all the time we were out.....  Chrispy!  "
