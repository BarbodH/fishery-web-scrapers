Over 100 anxious anglers registered for the event.  The event kicked off at the 0600 breakfast on the west side of Perfect Vue Camp Ground, everyone enjoyed the Egg Burritos or Eggs on Toast with all the special condiments.  Co-Chair Bob announced the rules and everyone headed for their boats to be on the water ready for the 0700 shot-gun start.    The shot gun blasted and so did the many boats all primed and ready to fish. There was a trail of boats heading at full speed towards the fishing grounds.  Many of the boats headed to Mallory Bay,(where the fishing had been outstanding the previous week), while others headed to other familiar spots - Shermans Point / Thompsons Cove.  Everyone fished HARD for the allotted time and the weigh-in was active from 1130 til all the boats who were there had weighed in their catch. Lots of fish were brought to the scale and weigh-master Bob announced each weight for Registrar Jack to duly note in the log.  All fishers docked their boats and discussed the mornings fishing, some had good luck, while others were not so fortunate. All said that the amount of boat traffic in Mallory Bay had a profound effect on the bite of the walleyes.  The prizes and BBQ were scheduled for 1300 and everyone was anxious to get the results. The crowd gathered around the podium and waited with patience. Some waited by the prize table - which was long and over flowing with lots of goodies.    Master of Ceremonies - Bob Fendley was in fine form and was pleased to announce the winners with a total catch of 14.1 lbs - The Three Amigos Fishing Team.    Hey Look at that- Superdad's team of Superdad's Dad / Laker John & Superdad. They sure looked happy with the prize $$.  Another BIG win for the Bayview Resort Campers and the Prize for the largest Sheepshead went to another Bayview Team - Jackie Parent and John Mydlinski Jr.    The prizes were given and the draws for the prizetable was underway as well as the BBQ lunch. Everyone had lots to eat and were kept laughing with the comments of Bob  F.  The crowd was most appreciative of all the action and all the hard work by the organizers.    Following the completion of the prizes, M/C Bob introduced the organizers for the 2008 Legends of Perfect Vue Derby. We wish them well and offer our best wishes and sincere thanks to Jack and Bob for their efforts in the last six years.  Tight Lines to all who took part in the derby and see you next week at Bayview.   David     aka   Superdad"
