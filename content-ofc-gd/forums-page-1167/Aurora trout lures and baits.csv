102061,Yellow14,2007-08-08 14:01:00,29,Hi everyone  Well I am planning to go up to Kirkland Lake around the 17th of August and I just learned that the Aurora Trout fishery is open this year from August to mid-October. Apparently it is only open one year out of 3 in the area or something along those lines. I figure this is my chance to catch a pretty uncommon fish but would like some advice on what bait or lures to use on this fish since I mostly fish for bass.
102072,TJQ,2007-08-08 14:28:00,7806,"I dont know too many people who have got one, however, I have heard ya fish them just like speckled trout."
102077,FinS,2007-08-08 14:36:00,463,u fish for them the same way as TJ mentioned
102085,Yellow14,2007-08-08 14:45:00,29,"Hmm, I guess it would have to be Wynn Lake. Why, what's going on at Wynn Lake?  It's not the only fish I am after, I will be just as happy with a pike or good size walleye or bass."
102089,FinS,2007-08-08 14:47:00,463,ahhh nothing im just jealous hahahaha
102106,solopaddler,2007-08-08 15:10:00,8605,"Like TJ said, fish 'em like specks. Good chance you'll see me there as well when it opens  ."
102114,Terry,2007-08-08 15:25:00,14456,I am waiting till they open up Carol Lake again and I will try to catch one
102197,solopaddler,2007-08-08 20:53:00,8605," I guess it would help to check these things  . For some reason my brain was telling me Aug.15th was the opener, but it was actually August 1st. Hope there's a few left when I make it over there..."
102227,Moosebunk,2007-08-08 22:45:00,3970,"I know all too well the heartaches of fishing for auroras.  Be prepared for the surprise closures and ""MNR. NO FISHING"" signs posted on the final tree beside the lake."
102233,Terry,2007-08-08 23:03:00,14456,yes they have done that  before...it's why I don't have my Aurora yet....last minute closures
