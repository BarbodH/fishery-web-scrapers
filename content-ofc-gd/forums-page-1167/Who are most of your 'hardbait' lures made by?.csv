101531,007,2007-08-07 03:18:00,537,"Hi everyone.  I've just been sorting through my tackle box and I've noticed that most of my hardbait lures (crankbaits, stickbaits, minnowbaits, jerkbaits and the like) are made by one company - Rapala.  I seem to have amassed quite a collection of lures but strangely I have kept almost exclusively to one manufacturer.  Having just looked through the Bass Pro catalogue I realise that there are many other lures of this type made by other companies that I could be missing out on.  So it got me wondering whether everyone else out there is loyal to one brand and what the favourite is or whether most of you have a mixture of lures by different companies.  Any suggestions on excellent hardbait lures I'm missing out on by sticking to the one manufacturer would also be appreciated...  Cheers 007"

101720,Bly,2007-08-07 18:30:00,1556,"We have several Rapala's and a few of the others but my favorite ""hardbait"" is a Cotton Cordell.  I don't generally shop by brand, I shop for the the type and color of lure I want."
101796,PHISHY!,2007-08-07 22:44:00,24,"Have all sorts of hard baits, but I love the Rapala's due to the success I've had in the past decade or so!  I absolutely love the x-rap's."
102005,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-08 10:58:00,0,Rapalas by far............
102022,OhioFisherman,2007-08-08 11:39:00,6623,"I have a mix, on some a mix of sizes of the same style and a mix of colors. Different profiles, running depths, actions, I like to be able to cover the bases. Even on surface lures some days one stlye(chugger, popper, torpedo, walker) will work better than the others.  Rapala makes some good lures, but Storm, Bandit, Cotton Cordell and others do also. LOL give them what they want, don`t try to force feed them."
102116,fishindevil,2007-08-08 15:28:00,6254,"Well lets see,you also missed alot of companies,like for us salmon fishermen,and walleyes guys,i have hundreds of spoons,and harnesses as well as jigs too,but for general fishing i would have to say i have tons of rapala lures,some that havnt even been wet yet.....good thread,its interesting    cheers"
102122,Raf,2007-08-08 15:59:00,3495,legend baits and drifter tackle I'd say.
