101792,Zamboni,2007-08-07 22:31:00,235,"My kids chipped in and bought themselves a Wii last month-plenty in stock in southern Ontario. Best Buy in Whitby has them-can you just call or email the stores and they ship it-pay cc?  Comes with 5 games on cd.....kids played with it 2 weeks, hasn't been on since."
101793,lew,2007-08-07 22:33:00,12767,"Hey TJ, I'm like solopaddler and have absolutely NO idea what that thing is either, but if you can locate one down here in the city and they won't deliver, I can pick it up and drop it off at your place on the 16th when I'm passing thru."
101947,TJQ,2007-08-08 02:24:00,7806,Nailed one at EB Games!!!   I was in there the day before yesterday and they said they had no idea when they were getting some.. thansk!!
101950,Whopper,2007-08-08 02:37:00,2174,"Glad ya got hooked up TJ or I'd a brought you one up, there a dime a dozen down here and my son is always whealing and dealing those game sets.   Lew & Mike they are video games systems   Whopper"
101980,Victor,2007-08-08 05:46:00,1609,hey TJ ... if you have figured out how to play it ... i think you should consider getting the rapala fishing game ... i have planning to buy it also just for that game lol ... sounds fun
102123,MJL,2007-08-08 16:00:00,2427,"I don't own one or know which stores have them in stock...All I can say is wear the wrist strap on controllers at all times when you're playing (especially baseball)...My friend threw his controller through his brand new LCD TV this past Christmas...There's also a web-site out there that shows many of the wii related accidents that have occurred since it first came out on the market.  On the brightside, you do burn a lot of calories while playing it."
102156,TJQ,2007-08-08 17:46:00,7806,LOL... Averys been playing it...  its hilarious... he 'a sweatin'
