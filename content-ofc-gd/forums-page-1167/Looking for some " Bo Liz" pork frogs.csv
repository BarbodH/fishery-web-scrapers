I'd be willing to travel a bit.Just can't find them local as of yet.      Not even sure if they still make them.I've been useing the same pork baits for some time now.  They are GREAT for big pike, with a weedless hook."
102068,ranger520vx,2007-08-08 14:17:00,164,"I know they were made by Strike King and discontinued about a decade. I have several jars left myself and love them. Ebay is your best bet.  Went by name ""PORK O..."""
102078,OhioFisherman,2007-08-08 14:37:00,6623,"Don`t think I have ever seen them, can`t find any info on them."
102098,banger,2007-08-08 14:56:00,95,"  that's the stuff!  I thought they were Uncle Josh.But your right! it was strike king. I just lost my last one, a while ago.And the lable was ripper/worn off.They kinda last a long time eh.  lol.  I guess ebay it is. ( I hate flea bay)   Thanks."
102102,fishinggeek,2007-08-08 15:03:00,325,"In case you weren't aware, I think Uncle Josh makes a similar product.  I was wondering how you rig such a bait?  I think I've seen Pete Bowman on FNC rig them with a single hook and a treble trailer but he didn't explain how to do it, and I couldn't figure it out in the split second I saw the rig."
102104,banger,2007-08-08 15:06:00,95,"I just used a weedless hook ( the one with the keeper) and ripped it through the weeds. A great Pike bait.  I use the smaller pork baits with my Johnson silver minnow , and one of my fave.The old pig & jig.Great for flipping in heavy cover."
