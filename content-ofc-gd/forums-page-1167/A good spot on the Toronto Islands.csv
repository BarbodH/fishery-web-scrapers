Cheers "

Its just down from the walk bridge.  Just fish in front of there and you should have luck.  Ive pulled out the nicest pike from that spot.  good luck"

101633,gforce,2007-08-07 14:14:00,63,Welcome to OFC Coop-dog!  It was a nice day on the islands....  The only thing we caught was the attention of those chics on the Ferry.
