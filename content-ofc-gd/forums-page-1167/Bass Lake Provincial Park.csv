Anyone have any luck so far this year? I convinced my wife to come camping, so hopefully there will be plenty of action on the water, to keep her entertained.  Whats in the lake? I am assuming Bass (lol), what about walleye and pike?  Thanks for any help!"

Most baits can coax them up.  There is a youth fishing tournament there on saturday, so try and be respectful of them, they want to have a good time."
