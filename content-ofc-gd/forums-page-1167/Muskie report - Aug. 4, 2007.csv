101330,Roy,2007-08-06 19:01:00,13728,"J and I had the pleasure of spending a few hours on the river with Marc Thorpe on Saturday night. It was a great evening, a little wind but comfy. We had two rods in the water and were trolling at about 5mph with perch coloured baits. We launched at 5:15PM and returned at 8:15. The final score was 2-2. Two solid rips but were unable to get a hookset. We were more fortunate with the two other rips. J got the first (and largest) fish of the evening and like a trooper, brought the fish in herself. I got the next one, a smaller fish but a great specimen all the same. We didn't bother sticking (measuring) the fish but J's was a decent size. J and I would like to thank Marc for a wonderful evening and all the knowledge. If anyone has a chance to fish with Marc, do it.  "
