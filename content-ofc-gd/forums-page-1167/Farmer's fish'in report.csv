100803,banger,2007-08-03 22:10:00,95,"Went out to the pond today, and hooked into my fish.Started @ 5:15 am on the water, and by 7am had landed 6 not to bad Pike.All around the 28 inch mark.( not worth of a pic, so I did'nt take the time to snap any shots of the Pike.  As the day heated up and the sun started to cook us.I changed my set up from the old jonhson silver minon with a big green grub.To the big lizard.This is when the Bass, started to turn on.They were not hitting the soft plastic.But rather just sucking it in, and sitting with it.The only way to tell I had something on was to just set the hook when it felt weird or felt like nothing.And that kinda bite was the way it was for the day.Just a suck & sit with it, kinda bite.But I did  pretty good, and only missed 3 or 4 bass.And had 5 clean cut off's from some toothy criters.  Here's some pic;s of the Bass I nailed.All were released, they are still ready for me next time I go.    Total for the day.  Banger. 6 pike around 28 to 29 inches. ( no pic's for hammerhandles) And 5 NICE! Bass. I did not tape measure any of the Bass, and I don't have a scale any more. I would have to guesstimate them at around 3 to 4 pound for the average.   Here's my shot's. Sorry for the blurry pic's my Cam sucks.    Enjoy.        "
