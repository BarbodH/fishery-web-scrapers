101851,mcallister.grant,2007-08-08 00:13:00,327,Just thought I would share this experience.... This is a pic of my wife's first walleye. I had some business to do up in Bobcaygeon so I thought I would bring my wife along for the ride. As well as 3 dizen minnows and my rod. After my inspection we went to the dam for some ol'time walleye action. Needless to say we weren't dissapointed. My wife managed to land 4 and I landed around 30. None of them were over 1.5 lbs but it was a memorable experience. This was 2 weeks ago but I am so proud of the pic. http://s206.photobucket.com/albums/bb46/gr...nt=DSC00780.jpg
