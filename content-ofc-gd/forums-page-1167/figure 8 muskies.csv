We fished everywhere from Wendover to Hawksbury and thought we'd run into you somewhere.   And Dax, there ain't no such thing as an ugly musky, some are just purdier than others  Actually I have no idea what those brown marks are on the sides of the fish. They just appeared to be some sort of discoloring in the pigment and were on both sides of him. Sure didn't stop him from scrapping though"
101568,JFR,2007-08-07 11:02:00,498,Great report and photos.  You have a lot of patiences.  Thanks for sharing

101637,1leggedangler,2007-08-07 14:22:00,364,"Great report Lew and glad your time at the trailer got the good weather. Your co-pilot looks like she was having fun also. Thanks for the pics!  Cheers, 1leg"

101721,Aaron Shirley,2007-08-07 18:33:00,655,"Great muskie report Lew!  Sounds like you boys had ome fun, and even got the wife out too  I agree about the figure 8, it is the absolute best to get them hitting at the boat on a figure 8, oval or L-turn  Good fishing!  Aaron"
101737,addict,2007-08-07 19:37:00,475,that first pic is a super long lunge nice work
101770,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-08-07 21:08:00,0, Lew I had a rare day off on the Wednesday ( one in 2 weeks ) but my clients called and they were coming in a day later. So no need to tell you I enjoyed another day off on the Thursday. But you guys missed the hot fishing by a bit those clients even though they only fished 5 days instead of 6 they boated 15 fish with only 2 under 40. No monsters but half dozen over 44.
101958,Joey,2007-08-08 03:24:00,9122,Great report Lew.  I've yet to get a musky on a figure 8.  Haven't really had much of an opportunity to do so.  Can't wait to get my first figure 8 grabber  Beauty fish too  Joey
101991,Marc Thorpe,2007-08-08 09:26:00,621,"Beauty fish Lew,boat side is always cool"
102127,Rich,2007-08-08 16:07:00,3927,*crying in my toothpaste*  That's beautiful. Just beautiful!
101544,camillj,2007-08-07 04:21:00,1988,Wow ... aint it the truth !!!!   The best figure 8 for me was when I was demonstrating it to a buddy (no follow that I knew of) and I was explaining it to him why/when/wherefore ... and BAM ... a 12 lber hit me right behind the boat .... outa nowhere ... I just about wet myself  Good to see you had some fun at the trailer Lew !
101558,OhioFisherman,2007-08-07 09:45:00,6623,"Great pictures and report Lew, always nice to fish with ""the boss""."
101563,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-08-07 10:43:00,0,"WTG Lew figure 8 muskies are a blast, we don't get many each year but they are even more fun then topwater fish."
