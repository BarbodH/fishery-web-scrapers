101372,brandon,2007-08-06 21:17:00,857,"sorry for all the non fishing related pics but I hit up Seymour again today for some more pics.  Weather wasn't the greatest and basically the whole hike was through clouds so the pics of the distant mountains I was hoping for weren't even a possibility.  Anyways I was practicing with panoramic pics and also got a pic of a grouse.....enjoy..  oh and the topic is titled ""say whaaaat"" because thats the vibe this grouse was giving me    this pic is really 5 stiched together using a panoramic photo program....im very impressed with how it turned out   this pic is 6 images stitched together.....and again i had no idea they would turn out this good   well that should be the last of my taking up board space for non fishing material for now because the weekend is over....who knows what next weekend will bring....enjoy the photos"
