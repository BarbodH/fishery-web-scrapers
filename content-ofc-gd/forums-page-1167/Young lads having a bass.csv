When he found out what boat he was going to be on,he was very excited.    The morning started off nice and calm but over cast.I would of preferred the sun,but what can ya do with mother nature.      The prefish for this was awesome,but the day of,well sucked for me,but my partner was on fire.Again proving the back of the boat is the place to be.LOL I believe we had fourteen bites all day,and only missed on two (turned out to be an important two at the end of the day)  The winds picked up and I got to say,I HATE WIND.A light breeze is fine,then you can work the weeds.  We bumped in to the young lad and JP a few times,guess we had them going as the word got out we had fifteen pounds,I over exagerated.LOL  Was a long day with some pretty tough conditions.The top five were with,n 5 oz,s.  1. -13.42 2. 13.32 2. 13.32 4. 13.22 5. 13.14   And again the young lad finished in front of me. Alex managed to win big fish. 4+ largie.   A few fpic,s from the day.        Im just holding these,they belong to my partner in front of me.LOL  Nice fish there Alex.I know you read the board,thanks for a great day out there.    After draining out the livewell,you can see why the pumps can get fouled.Nothing but craw shell pieces left.  "
101584,Terry,2007-08-07 11:34:00,14456,sounds like a lot of fun..... I like the back of the boat too
101587,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-07 11:38:00,0,Great Report. What lake were you on?
101597,misfish,2007-08-07 12:20:00,29133,"  Now Johnny,would you ask a women her age"
101600,charlesn,2007-08-07 12:46:00,551,"Good job on the big fish of the event Brian.  Where you saw me was where we got all our weight too.  I think most teams were on the same pattern and that's why we all had such close weights.  Had a blast and look forward to the next event.  I'm sure Ryan had a blast with JP, but now he will be encouraging you to buy a 70 mph bass boat.  Charles"
101604,Jay T,2007-08-07 12:58:00,282,"Looks like you guy's had some good fishing. 70mph bass boat, I am lucky if mine boat goes 7mph LOL."
101606,misfish,2007-08-07 13:02:00,29133,"It would be cheaper to pay the gas and let you guys take him out.LOL   BTW Charles won the tourney,sand bagger was one of the names going around.LOL Congrats dude."
101611,charlesn,2007-08-07 13:19:00,551,"Sandbagger?  C'mon Brian, you know I would never purposely underestimate the size of my fish...  You're right about it being cheaper to pay for the gas as a rider than owning one of these things.  It's a very expensive hobby to be addicted to, that's for sure.  Thanks man."
101746,addict,2007-08-07 19:49:00,475,thanks for sharing i love the tourney reviews.had the chance to fish with a tourney man this weekend learned a few things one being bass boats are smokin fast
