So again, hello everyone, my name is Young and I was a student at UofT but now I am doing my grad studies in Europe. I am here in TO for the summer holidays and have been fishing/camping  whenever I can.  However, all this is coming to an end soon when I have to go back to Europe. Therefore, as a final trip, my friend and I are looking for a good fishing/camp trip for 4 days, and I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions.  We have done couple of Algonquin trips already and many provincial park trips within 3,4 hour distance from TO. We do not mind a further drive and would really like to try catch muskie. If anyone has any suggestions, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

Otherwise for good fishing I would suggest the following parks (some I have been to, others have been recommended to me):  Algonquin Charleston Lake Balsam Lake (pretty sure there are muskies in there) Bonnechere Bon Echo Killbear Restoule Silent Lake St Lawrence (pretty sure there are muskies in there)  Good luck 007"
