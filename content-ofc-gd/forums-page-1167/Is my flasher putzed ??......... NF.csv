102008,lew,2007-08-08 11:09:00,12767,I was out in the truck this morning and my right turn signal started flashing about twice the normal speed.  The left side works fine and the 4 ways are normal.  Is it just a bulb needs replacing or has the flasher seen better days ??  It's an 05 Safari
102010,wallyboss,2007-08-08 11:14:00,1095,Most cars do that when you have a bulb that is burnt.
102012,lew,2007-08-08 11:17:00,12767,"Thanks wb, that's what I'm assuming too, I just didn't want to pay for a flasher if it's not required"
102016,OhioFisherman,2007-08-08 11:23:00,6623,"Lew put on your 4-way flashers and see if a bulb is out, same ones for them as the turn signals. I have seen cars also do that when a trailer is hooked up, heavy duty flasher will fix it or just a new one maybe.  LOL I used ones from a semi after the first time."
102025,Tacklebuster,2007-08-08 11:42:00,303,its most likely just a bulb.
102027,pikehunter,2007-08-08 11:46:00,1659,"The bulb Lew. Maybe the bulb also doubles as a brake light if it's a rear one, if so then you also have a brake light out."
102031,lew,2007-08-08 12:12:00,12767,"Thanks boyz, it was just a bulb as suspected.  It happened at 5:30 this AM and I was just too lazy to get outta the truck and look at it"
