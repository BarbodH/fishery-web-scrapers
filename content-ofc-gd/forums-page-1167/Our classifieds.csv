It's a really active part of our community and everyone should try to use it.  Here's a good example.....it just came up for sale...don't even try to bargain him down, it's too good a deal. Just click on classifieds"
101922,Team 8,2007-08-08 01:48:00,1,"Oh fer,.................what do have for sale Roy, lol??????"
101927,Gerritt,2007-08-08 01:54:00,6129,"Roy, I agree!  have been browsing them for some time now... Infact I almost bought a boat!!... until the wife announced something big..... yup... the freezer died... you heard it here folks... LOL... In the end I did wind up purchasing a boat from another OFC'r.... I have bought a couple things from the classifieds and they have all be very smooth transactions â€¦ nice to see seasoned members posting their wares for sale... as opposed to some triad classified.. also not allowing people that are not contributing members is added assurance to those on the fence... Yet again OFC comes through, looking after it's members.  Gerritt."
