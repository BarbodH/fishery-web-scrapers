Just seems like its getting too hard to find time to fish. well i am glad to say i am back and i look forward meeting you all again. i live in brantford i do lots of river fishing , and  perch fishing in port dover in my fathers 14 ft shallow bottom boat.  i hate to do this but i do need a little bit of help. ( not the reason for coming back mind you ) i have been able to have my first weekend off so we going camping !!!!!!  we are headed to CRAIGLEITH park .  the question i have is i have only fished once up in Georgian bay with a lot bigger boat.  1. will i be ok using a 14ft shallow bottom boat up there.  and 2. where can i put the boat in and how far out would i have to go to catch fish.  id love to find out on my own  but we only there for the weekend and i really wana make the most out of it and catch some fish lol."

How far out, oh gawd, nothing that close right now, maybe a few bass hanging around the shoals....did I mention PROP biting shoals, you'll see what I mean, all sorts of little ""islands"" popping up, made of rocks that bite props. Be careful with a shallow 14' boat, it can get extremely rough out there in a hurry."
101755,fishinBrant,2007-08-07 20:25:00,10,thank you for replying .  rough waters is what i am worried about with the boat.  I was hoping the fishing would be little better  we do have down riggers  we can throw on if needed.   and thank you for the boat launch tip.
