I'm glad to see that the board is still as alive and informative as ever.  I definitely missed reading all the posts and reports, so I'm glad to say that I'm back in the mix.  I start my fishing days again next week with a week long cottage trip booked.  Stay tuned for my first report (at least on the new site that is!).....   Oh....and I had a beautiful baby boy......can't wait to post his first fish ever caught (probably in at least 3 or 4 years!)  "
