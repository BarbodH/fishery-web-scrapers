361028,splashhopper,2009-07-11 21:51:00,2931,"I have two places that I have been catching some LM bass the last two weeks on Top-water tactics.  I prefer fishing at dusk right now, but the bite seems off this week.  I am wondering if it is because I am fishing on the east side of the pond and it is still pretty bright with light there until 9pm.. The west side of the pond has a long stand of mature trees creating a very shaded area... I don't fish it much as the access to the water is pretty dense and steep.  My question is:  At dusk, should I try fishing in the shady area earlier(6:30pm till dark?) instead of waiting for the sun to drop on the east side of the pond. The fish seem to be hitting around 8-9 pm on the east side.  I have another place with the same situation that I am going to try next week after work and am wondering the same thing there.  Thanks again  Splashhopper"
361032,bigugli,2009-07-11 22:01:00,6138,Hit the shade earlier. The feeding will happen there before it happens on the east shore. So will the mosquitos
361065,Jer,2009-07-12 00:33:00,1426,definitely the shady side.
361072,cuillerierk,2009-07-12 00:49:00,32,Shady side ...   They will more likely be feeding here before. imo
361075,Greencoachdog,2009-07-12 00:55:00,8163,Try both sides!... we want you to do the leg work and tell us what works best!!!
361100,Jonny,2009-07-12 01:59:00,1380," You want to stay away from those damned areas at dusk.  Or wear a cross and stuff your pockets with garlic --- then you should be all right.  The west side definitely, especially if it's steep like you say --- more shadow earlier."
361103,splashhopper,2009-07-12 02:10:00,2931,"fished the shady side till 8 o'clock tonight... not hits... used a Senko and my top water frog...  moved to directly across the pond .... same thing tonight,,, except for two small smallies on the Senko  I think the BIG wind that blew through had a lot to do with it also.  The wind blew the humidity right outa here  Will try again in the morning...  thanks again  splashhopper"
361243,Leecher,2009-07-12 17:25:00,7832,Definitely the shade side like others said.... if senkos and frogs don't produce.... switch it up to crankbaits like BigOs in white or chartreuse.... LMB & SMB love this plug Leechman
361249,jpmclean,2009-07-12 18:13:00,9,I was in the same boat last night fishin from the shade into some pools - couldnt get a bite for an hour or so so I switched to using a crickhopper (grn) and also one of those mimmic minnows and i went from catching nothing to catching some decent bass almost immediately.
