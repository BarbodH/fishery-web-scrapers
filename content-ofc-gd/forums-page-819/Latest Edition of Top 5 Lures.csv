361074,Burning Babies,2009-07-12 00:51:00,150, They were the best thing in my tacklebox this spring for about a two-week window.  They have a little bit wider wobble than your average lipless crankbait and an attractive flutter on the fall.  Definitely worth checking out.  I did notice the metallic one's paint chips easily though.
