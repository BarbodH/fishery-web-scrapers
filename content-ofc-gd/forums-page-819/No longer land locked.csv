She was very surprised when I said lets look for somthing like this. After fishing with Terry a couple weeks ago,I came home and said I want a bass boat again. She said what ever you want.I was joking of course. The circle of life has come around.  WE,,,,,NO,,,,WERE, AS HAPPY AS HAPPY CAN BE.  And yes,she said I can put downrigger on it.LOL  Like she had a choice.LOL  BTW,SMALLIES ARE STILL GOING TO GET CAUGHT."
