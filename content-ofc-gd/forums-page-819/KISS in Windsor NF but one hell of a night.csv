My 17 year old son is a fan as well- hoping they play more Ontario dates as I didn't want the hassle of trying to get him into Rama."
361214,MuskyBill,2009-07-12 14:26:00,311,"Great pics Mike!  I saw them at the Gardens many moons ago, with Ted Nugent opening!"
361224,Joey,2009-07-12 14:49:00,9122,Great stuff Mike.  Kiss was the first concert I ever went to (with my dad ugh) in Sudbury when I was about 10  Looks like you two had a great time.  Joey
361228,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-12 15:24:00,10439,"I wonder if they will come up and play Yellowknife. For some reason almost all big name bands ignore us, go figure. The last big name band we got up here was The White Stripes."
361278,ohhenrygsr,2009-07-12 20:44:00,947,Anyone got tickets for the rama show?
361338,MuskyBill,2009-07-13 01:19:00,311,"I have tickets for Rama, but they're for Stompin' Tom, not KISS....."
361342,Dutch,2009-07-13 01:26:00,831,"Those are some great shots, you must've had some really good tickets.  KISS show live would be awesome."
