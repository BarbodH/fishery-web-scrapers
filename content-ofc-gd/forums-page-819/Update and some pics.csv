One measured 29"" and the other 30"". Everyone likes fish pics so figured I would put 'em up on this dark stormy day.        The last one demolished my spinner bait.    Hit some decent perch.      Bass have been small so far. Here is the biggest legal in season  to date.    Bluegill and WGSF are still around.      All fish released.  Hope to get out more often and find something bigger"
360936,richyb,2009-07-11 16:00:00,774,Nice report but im pretty sure your bluegill is a pumpkin seed ( sunfish) or one of those hybrid's that ive heard about.
360946,musky66,2009-07-11 16:19:00,273,"Nice report, but I'm not crazy about the 'ski pictures, can't stand to see them lying on a probably very hot vinyl like that, Why not wait until you catch a really nice sized ski before worrying about photo's? I have learned to put my camera on a timed delay shot so I can be in my pic with the fish- better for the fish I think. Just my 2 cents- not trying to diss you."

361202,Greencoachdog,2009-07-12 13:49:00,8163,Great report and fish Jeff!!!  Glad to see you're getting into some Musky... it's only a matter of time before you get a big'un yanno!!!  ... I think the smaller ones are cuter than the big'uns anyway!!!!  Has the Addy gal been able to get out with you?
361217,Roy,2009-07-12 14:33:00,13728,Good stuff Jeff. Thanks for posting your pics.
