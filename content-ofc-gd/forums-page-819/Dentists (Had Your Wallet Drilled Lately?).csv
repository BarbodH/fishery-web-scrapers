360601,bigbuck,2009-07-10 15:28:00,2449,"I'd interview the dentist first. If the eyes light up when insurance is mentioned, go to another down the street. I've learned the hard way, in the past 6 years, I have had so many cavities drilled that it is not funny. Strange though, in the previous 32 years, I only had 4 cavities and in the year and a half since I changed dentists, I have had none. But with my previous dentist, I averaged 2-3 cavities per year. What I'm getting to is that there are some dental offices out there that are very 'aggressive' with their dentistry especially when you have coverage. My current dentist makes a good living and is not interested in taking new patients and doesn't call every couple of months to go in for a cleaning (max. 4/year with insurance). I go once a year for a cleaning and checkup and have had absolutely no problems with my teeth. To boot, he doesn't charge a dime over what the insurance company covers."
360605,CLofchik,2009-07-10 15:33:00,854," What he said.  ""Universal"" is not ""Free"", universal just means those that can't afford coverage on their own leech off those that can.  On the subject of Canadian dental coverage, seriously think about a trip to Mexico or South America if you need a large procedure.  All their docs are US trained (which generally means better training than in Canuckistan), and for the price of a procedure here you can get the same thing done in Mexico or Costa Rica for 1/10th the price and have a vacation on top of it.  Girlfriend got an implant that would've cost $2k here for under USD$500 in Mexico, the whole week for the two of us came in under what just the procedure here would've cost.  Hey Photoz, I hear there's some jumbo carp in Mexico.......just say'n"

360625,Billy Bob,2009-07-10 16:15:00,5865," I like the conversation on this from both sides but if we have to exchange info ALL must be real facts not hear say.  Where is the world did you hear it cost $30,000 per child ? ? ? Under our health insure the cost would be $10 for every doctor or hospital visit.  So that would equal 3000 Dr/Hosp visits per child to add up to $30,000.00..........Now of course you have to factor in the cost of the insurance per year and that right now is $1300 per year for the family plan. Dental is ZERO deductible but eye glass coverage only pays about 10% of the total bill including the exam. I'm 54 years old and know too many folks that had to be confined in the hospital for days, weeks or even months like when my mom passed away. NO one ever had to sell their homes or anything else. The most my dad had to pay when my mom was in the hospital for months was under $2000.00  There is a saying going around here in the Great USA...........""If you think Health Care Cost too much now, wait until it's Free from the government"".  Bob"
360638,Fish4Eyes,2009-07-10 16:56:00,1022,You just have a dentist who is a shwindler. Shop around.
360808,markiemark70,2009-07-11 02:09:00,158,"  OK Mea Culpa, the $30,000 per child thing was me being dramatic, but the story that neither of us have touched on so far is that there is a population the size of Canada in the US right now that has no insurance, meaning either come up with the funds or die. Surely any universal (albeit sometimes pretty crappy) system is better than that.  I do tech support for a living and one day while working on the computer of a client from the US, she told me how at her previous job, they messed up the paperwork on some type of insurance that carries you from the day you leave one job to the day that you start the next (she had a name for it, but I can't remeber). So as luck would have it, on the 1 day that she technically had no insurance, she needed an emergency gall bladder removal. Well the list price is $60,000 for that, but there was a way that you could apply to the hospital to have it done for 60% of the cost by claiming hardship. SO it cost her $36,000 out of her own pocket for what amounts to day surgery. And that is a first hand story, no hear say.  I just want to make clear I am not bashing the US. I love the US and it is without a doubt the 2nd greatest country in the world. I just know that it will be even better when you guys stop paying gazillions of dollars for private fat cat executives who actually have business plans detailing how they can provide LESS health care to Americans. THe government can't possibly darn it up any more than those guys."

360876,Billy Bob,2009-07-11 10:24:00,5865," EXCUSE me but that is EXACTLY what ""Hear Say"" is. When you tell me what someone else says it equals ""Hear Say"".  Again I know NO ONE who is broke or lost their homes because of a stay in the hospital...........Their are MILLIONS of people here that have no health insurance what so ever and get FREE health care at ANY hospital in the US. It's called Medicaid... stop believing what you hear from hear say as I have stopped believing hear say from many here that say if you need a operation in Canada you will probably die before you can get it. I don't see any Canadians dieing along the roads when I fish up there and you wouldn't see any here."

I went to the dentist 3 weeks ago.  He removed the old filling, put in a new one, and remodeled the tooth with extra filling.  $160.00.  You got robbed."
360257,Photoz,2009-07-09 21:43:00,792,"A subject that I've never seen discussed? It used to be the 2 biggest expenditures we made in life was buying a home, and buying a car . . . .   I'd say a visit to the dentists office is fast closing in on the number 2 spot! I went for a cleaning and 6 month check-up 2 weeks ago . . . .    found 1 SMALL cavity, so I made an appointment to come back today. When he did a second X-ray, and did a lotta 'hm m m m m   m's' I got ready to 'assume the position!' Yup . . .    it looked like I needed a root canal . . .   .      so I asked how much? Well, getting a straight answer was similar to trying to nail jello to the wall . . .     finally he explained there were 'variables,' it could cost up to $3000.00 and Great West Insurance would LIKELY cover up to $1700.00, leaving ME holding the bag for the rest! I was somewhat annoyed & asked how a tooth could get THAT bad since January, without aching . . .    but if he couldn't fill it, out she comes . . .    but I want the tooth. After examining it some more, he filled it . . . .    not even a big filling . . .     $710.00! To me, this is LEGAL ROBBERY!  Now that I've had my rant, I'd like to know if anyone else out there has had similar experiences? And what on earth does someone, ESPECIALLY with kids do if they're not insured? The government has put a stop to price gouging by SOME doctors but NOBODY ever says boo about the dental industry. I read a story not long ago that the AVERAGE dentist pulls down $175,000.00 a year, and MANY make triple that?"
360264,Billy Bob,2009-07-09 22:35:00,5865,"Hold on, Wait a minute..............I thought HEALTH coverage was FREE in the Great Country of Canada ?  ?  ?  Under my wife's insurance plan everything you listed would be free of charge in the USA.......  BTW do I think this is legal highway robbery.........NO,not in the least....do you want someone that went to MANY years of school or do you want someone that thinks he knows how to drill out you cavity.......$175,000.00 is NOTHING especially considering it being Canadian Funds. The local mechanic that MAY of went to school for a couple of years is charging you more. Think about that for a minute.  Bottom line I hope your dental problems are solved any you are feeling better ASAP.  Bob"
360270,pikehunter,2009-07-09 22:59:00,1659,"Most dental work is not covered under provincial health insurance, no longer are eye exams if you are over 18 and under 65, that is unless the exam shows you have cataracts or you are diabetic. Dental work is out of pocket, unless you have a plan from work or can afford your own plan if you are self employed.  My plan at work would probalby not cover the bill you faced Photoz, mine maxes out at $2000 per year, I already have used up $1400 so far this year.  When I was self employed or I was struggling along on commission sales I had to pay everything out of my own pocket for my wife, son and myself. Luckily my wife and son are both blessed with great teeth and it was usually a trip to the dentist for a cleaning and a check up. Me on the other hand just has to look at a piece of celery and a tooth breaks and I have had more root canals than I can remember. Most dentists will give a break to those who have no coverage by not charging the current fee scale and this was a big help to me when I needed it.  Just remember that a dentist practice will cost a fortune to set up and this is after all that money has been spent on education and all the time and years that went into it. And think of how many of us could do that type of work, bent over with your face stuck in peoples mouths all day, bad breath, rotten teeth, people with colds and diseases, high suicide rates, carpel tunnel, bad backs, alcoholism, I could go on and on.  Be thankful that there is someone who is willing to shove their hand in your mouth to fix your teeth. Maybe your dentist did only just have to fill your tooth, could be he tried to charge you more than necessary or do more work than needed, then he might have been trying to do the right thing. But I bet you will be back to him in short time because you're going to be climbing the walls in pain and you are going to be at his chair side begging for help."
360279,Fisherman,2009-07-09 23:39:00,7201,"Ya, had an encounter like that a year ago, you need a root canal, unfortunately, no longer in the service with heater in holster to even the level of intimidation, I asked what the option was, $800+ for root canal..$80 for the extraction and it better not hurt.  About ten mintes later minus one tooth that I don't miss or have to brush anymore.  More room to squirrel away some peanuts."

BTW, Insurance Companies have their own Fee Guide ( with prices lower then ODA ), and they won't pay $0.01 more then they have to.

My parents, both were dentists -in another country, much different- and I can tell you that most of the stuff that it costs you thousands of $$$ today, could be done with perhaps hundreds, tops. Not talking about implants or dental surgery - just the basic treatments: cavity treatment and fillings, root canal fillings, cleaning, scaling, simple bridges. Let's say the consumables would cost today tenfold, it's still a lot of room left...  But what makes the prices spiral, are mainly 2 things:  - the exaggerated cost for education & licensing: an arm and a leg + interest. Who's paying for ? You, the patient, because you're at the bottom of the food chain...  - the involvement of the private insurance in the act: all the dentists that work with insured patients tend to charge the max allowable amount for a certain procedure. Year after year, like it or not, the insurance companies have to review their ""blue book values"" and they always go up. Who's paying, again? You, the patient, since on one hand the insurance companies allow those values to spiral up, and on the other hand they limit the amount you can be covered for, per year - discussing the typical group insurance, which most of us receive in our benefits package.  Just my 2 cents."

I would still rather have ""FREE"" health care for the basics. My wife & I have just had 2 kids in the last few years. What does that cost in the states? $30,000+ per? My mom's last husband died of Luekemia after a 2 month battle. At one point the doctors told us that 1 procedure out of the dozens that they did was a $400,000 procedure. We were saying at the time that if we lived in the states we would be selling our house to get it done, if that would even cover it. He lived in the hospital for 2+ months at our bill: $0  So some perspective is a good thing."
