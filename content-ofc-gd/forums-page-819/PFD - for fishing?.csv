360983,Rattletrap2,2009-07-11 19:36:00,1652,It would come down to personal preference. Just make sure it is roomy under the arms (vest style) and Transport Canada approved. I like the ones that are mesh backed for summer weather to help stay cool.
361019,JohnF,2009-07-11 21:25:00,3494,Aren't there some that are purpose built for kayakers? Seems to me I saw some pics of someone here who wore one whilst fishing from the 'yak. Nice tidy little unit that didn't interfere with the armswing or the boat.  JF
361036,wallyboss,2009-07-11 22:32:00,1095,They make special ones for kayaking. You need loose under the arms and one that has flotation just on the shoulder area so it doesn't bother you when seated.
