361091,bigugli,2009-07-12 01:43:00,6138,Put the baits in a sealed bag of fresh ground coffee for a week or two. The scent will permeate the plastic. We used to spread a can of ground coffee on the floor of meat hauling reefers. Even does a good job of blocking the odour from loads of fresh culled chicken.
