361159,outdoorguy61,2009-07-12 05:12:00,220,"And of course to the French it is a dore.  I grew up with the term pickeral, or yellow pickeral and now almost always use the term walleye.  Some fish like salmon or lake trout have many regional variations.  outdoorguy61"
361196,Billy Bob,2009-07-12 13:17:00,5865,"Oh yea, I can see the big line there waiting to get in.........LOL........I have seen several of these roadside stands in my travels through out Ontario and believe it or not this has the most business I have ever seen. It must be the times I drive by.........  Here in the Buffalo, NY area anyone older than 50 years old called walleyes ""yellow pike"" but now that has changed. On Friday's Buffalo was big, no HUGE on Fish Fries at every tavern, watering hole, saloon, gin mill or restaurant. It still is but a lot of the local watering holes have come and gone but not all. However, the fish that was on every menu was ""yellow pike"" but that has changed over the years because they are no longer commercially fished in the US. Now every fish fry is haddock and most wouldn't know what a ""yellow pike"" is if they did see it on a menu........times have changed and not always for the better.  Everyone still brags what restaurant has the best fish fry in town........and of course that would be in my back yard and ""yellow pike"" is still on my menu not to mention homemade fries, coleslaw and macaroni salad.

361200,musky66,2009-07-12 13:36:00,273,"Wish we had some of those kinds of 'chip trucks' round here- no Pickerel or Walleye- we need to run to Henry's South in Midland for a fix- love their 'battered Pickerel! When I was a kid growing up and reading fish books- they were called a Walleyed Pike Perch- pretty descriptive name for sure, but I still like it."
361208,Jonny,2009-07-12 14:18:00,1380," This one is out of town and mainly serves a local bayshore community of about 300 cottages and year-round homes. ""Busy"" is having to wait in line behind four people!   Every spring I hope they open again, and they do. Business must be good enough.  In Sturgeon Falls there are several chip stands (four that are very popular) where you can sometimes have to wait quite a while for your order. There are six or seven chip stands, in a community of about 5,000.   Same up in this neck of the woods. When I first moved to Timmins, where I lived most of my life, there was a bar/hotel on just about every block. The local hotels would stop serving at supper-time so the miners would go home to their families for supper. Things have quieted down a lot.  Same in the North Bay/Sudbury area.  Whatever we call 'em, pickerel have always been the premier freshwater fish for eating.   Sounds like a business opportunity!"
361232,Burning Babies,2009-07-12 16:41:00,150,"  Keep in mind that ""speckled trout"" is not the correct common name for Salvelinus fontinalis either."

359676,Jonny,2009-07-08 04:38:00,1380,"When I was a kid fishing with my parents, I didn't even know that another name for pickerel was walleye. Even when I was in my 20's I don't think I heard the term ""walleye"" used very much.  Same goes for partridge (ruffed grouse). Everybody just called them ""partridge"". Most people in Northern Ontario still do, I think.  ""Pickerel"" is still the term I hear used most commonly for walleye.  I like the distinctiveness of both those terms - pickerel and partridge - and they're what I'm used to. I wonder how prevalent they are in other parts of Ontario.  Just for the fun of it, I'm going to try to set up the poll feature on this board - hope it works for me... "
359683,Twocoda,2009-07-08 05:39:00,4130,put the two of them together and i call it ...YUMMY...
359686,archie_james_c,2009-07-08 06:01:00,618,"I call them  both names during conversations. I've been brought up my whole life calling them pickerel and partridge...but facts are facts and that's just not their name, so I call them both, because I will never leave my roots behind.   As for calling them YUMMY....AGREED   ."
359720,Fish4Eyes,2009-07-08 11:53:00,1022,"The way I see it is; Canadians use pickerel, and Americans use walleye."
359736,bigugli,2009-07-08 12:52:00,6138,"I've gotten used to using the term 'walleye' after living in Southern Ontario the past 20 years, but partridge are partridge."
359739,Fisherman,2009-07-08 12:58:00,7201,"Again, how many walleral pickeleye polls do we need."
359759,Jonny,2009-07-08 13:44:00,1380," Sorry, haven't been around here long enough to know you had one. So I appreciate the responses.  I guess if a cyclical topic comes up (and clearly marked, like this one) you can just skip it?   It's only a temporary waste of space.   So I guess ""pickerel"" might be more prevalent in the north? The picture I posted is typical of the North Bay/Sturgeon Falls area. A number of eateries (restaurants, chip stands) advertise ""pickerel"" on their signs, but not walleye. So that must be the name people here mainly key in on.  Every once in a while you see it mis-spelled as ""pickeral""."
359762,backbay,2009-07-08 14:00:00,773,"Called them pickerel for years, only in the last 5 or so have I referred to them as walleye. Always have seemed to call them partridge, even though I knew I was hunting ruffed grouse!"
359769,Raf,2009-07-08 14:14:00,3495,"i think as you cross the french r. bridge heading north, they turn into pickerel."
359784,tambo,2009-07-08 14:47:00,85,good one raf...........it would be a good day to get both of them in the same day............walleye wrapped partridge deep fried
360032,Jonny,2009-07-09 05:15:00,1380,"Wow, I was kind of hoping that ""walleye"" wouldn't out-poll ""pickerel"".  Just made a shopping trip to North Bay today and counted 3 signs, all advertising ""pickerel"". I guess the term is alive and well around here."
360044,bigugli,2009-07-09 11:22:00,6138, That's because you are in a part of Ontario that has not been sufficiently Americanized and lobotomized
360054,blaque,2009-07-09 11:57:00,2419,I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal labotomy
360099,Jonny,2009-07-09 13:59:00,1380," Funny you should mention that. Nothing against our good friends to the south, but when I first started paying attention to the term, I considered ""walleye"" to be American, and that us good ol' Canadians called them pickerel. Maybe my impression wasn't so accurate even back then.  To me, however, they'll always be pickerel.   Whoa! I'll second that!  A bottle of Canadian whisky - Five Star, V.O., Wiser's, Alberta Premium, doesn't matter.  Anything that gives my Pepsi a kick."
360105,Dara,2009-07-09 14:09:00,3052,  you mean the Pickerel River?   bout 2 miles further up

360153,Garry2Rs,2009-07-09 16:26:00,1425,"I can remember when Canadians were forced to except the name Walleye, which is crude slang for a cataract condition, so that American tourists would understand that the ""Lodge"" wasn't advertising ""good fishing"" for Chain Pickerel...a small type of Pike. If we had to change the name, why couldn't we change it to the French Canadian name, Dore?  At least that name isn't disrespectful of a fine fish...and it's 100% Canadian!"
360156,Tdel,2009-07-09 16:42:00,393,Pickerel and Partridge were the terms used here for most of my life.  Never knew what a walleye was until I was in my twenties.  I think your line is a little too far north.  Tom
360175,smally21,2009-07-09 17:49:00,993,"i cant believe im having this conversation again.....  while i know that the term pickerel is prevalent in this area and geography is usually the strongest argument the simple fact is walleye and pickerel are two different fish.  however, you know what you mean and  i know what you mean when we say pickerel.  what i have yet to see is what would happen if you caught a walleye (canadian pickerel) and an actual pickerel, and you had both in the livewell.  would you say you caught 2 pickerel, or i pickerel 1 walleye, or how would you tell them apart if they are both pickerel - would you have to be from buffalo to know???  an onlooker would be confused when he saw 2 different fish in the bucket but you called them by the same name.  hey its your business you can call them whatever you like."
360195,dave524,2009-07-09 18:59:00,4508,"My dad grew up in Niagara and fished out of Port Colborne, I remember in the 50's he simply referred to them as Yellows, short for Yellow Pickerel, at the time I think the occasional Blue was still being caught.   Yeah I always called them Partridge , but then turned around and and called their cousins Spruce Grouse , go figure."
360199,Garry2Rs,2009-07-09 19:08:00,1425,"Smally21; you would have a Pickerel and a Pike...not a Northern Pike, but a Pike all the same! No one would mistake that smelly slimy toothy critter for a Pickerel!"
360297,smally21,2009-07-10 00:38:00,993,"you made me do it garrrry  Pickerel, common name for 3 closely related carnivorous, soft-rayed freshwater fishes in the PIKE family (Esocidae). In parts of Canada, the name is applied, erroneously, to the WALLEYE. The name is derived from an English diminutive of pike.  canadian encyclopedia.  and no, i dont get invited to alot of parties."
360303,Billy Bob,2009-07-10 00:46:00,5865,"You will all be assimilated so get use to WALLEYE and Ruffled Grouse and stop saying ""eh""........ you know....LOL"
360339,Jonny,2009-07-10 02:07:00,1380,"There are actually three true pickerels - redfin, grass and chain. But they are to all intents and purposes practically unknown in Canada. If a Canadian calls a fish a pickerel you know exactly what he means. A grass pickerel is usually called a grass pike.  I don't see any ""disrespect"" in the name ""pickerel"" for walleye.  It is what it is.  ""What's in a name? That which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet."" Romeo and Juliet (II, ii, 1-2)"
360534,dave524,2009-07-10 13:35:00,4508,"Lets put the shoe on the other foot, I keep hearing Americans on the Gulf Coast catching Speckled Trout. I am sure that a speck would last a matter of seconds in that warm salt water and they are really catching Spotted Weakfish."
