361439,Roy,2009-07-13 12:15:00,13728,Looks like a good time! Thanks for showing us.
361503,BassAsin,2009-07-13 15:03:00,806,thanks mike i was starting to doubt myself the bite was slow and i started downsizing lures there was a bit of a coldfront that had moved through the day prior and it made the fishing tough. so slow and small and they started to hit.  it sure was a god time Roy. a bad day on the lake is better than a good day at the office.
