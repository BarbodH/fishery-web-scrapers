359598,Musky or Specks,2009-07-08 01:59:00,2710,Trout are all going to be deep. Use a bottom walker or try vertical jigging
359682,Sinker,2009-07-08 05:18:00,8692,I don't think they'll be all that deep. Its been cold and windy. The lakes won't be set up very well yet IMO.  I'd troll the first main drop off. Cast to shore in the mornings and evenings.  GL!   S.
359701,camillj,2009-07-08 10:23:00,1988,Lead core and flutter spoon (wobbler or mooslik)... first try three colours and if nothing is happening go to seven ...
359761,rover1.5dx,2009-07-08 14:00:00,23,"I fished all three of those lakes last year in August.  Not a touch.  I was using a deep trolling weight and my favourite Algonquin spoon which runs at about 35 feet.  I distinctly remember paddling all of Little Trout while my GF took a snooze.  I had my graph on and marked nothing.  We camped at the west end of Butt/Ralph Bice and we both vertically jigged with spoons in the narrowing drop-off that went into about 45-80feet of water.  Again, no marks and no bites.  A week later we did very well in other lakes more in the central portion of the Park.  Nonetheless, as mentioned previously the weather's been cool and water temps should be colder than normal so evenings and mornings you may see trout feeding closer to the surface, especially the specks.  All those lakes have plenty of trout so be persistent and you'll do okay.  Good luck."
