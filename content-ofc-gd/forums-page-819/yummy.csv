360743,Twocoda,2009-07-10 22:48:00,4130,so are they going to tell us in detail where these test have been performed and whats the levels were ...or are we suppose to still use the fish consumption guide as our resource of information...  Ive never eaten anything out of Lake Ontario ...but i eat ALOT of fish from Lake Huron
360780,Greencoachdog,2009-07-11 00:59:00,8163,"  That's kinda like ""branch kin"" eh?... I peed in the upper part and he drank out of the lower part!   ... do you really think it's safe to eat ""A LOT"" of fish from any of the great lakes???"
360996,douG,2009-07-11 20:13:00,2693,"This report on a 'recent study' comes out every year, and still falls into line with the MNR's guide to eating Ontario sportfish.  *Yawn*, and shame on the press for snapping it up every time."
