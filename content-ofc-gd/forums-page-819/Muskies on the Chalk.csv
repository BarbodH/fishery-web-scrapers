361527,brookie87,2009-07-13 15:37:00,11,"10 years ago my cousin and i went lookin for muskies on the chalk river. first time on the chalk. we landed a few small ones and fought a behemoth for and hour (he had 6lb line on, so he eventually lost it) has anyone else had luck on this river chain? i heard throu the grapevine the fishing has declined due to AMERICAN fisherman invasion. i want to know if there is any truth to this because im going there in 10 days.  any ideas as to where/how to find the fish? -  lakes, presentation, time of day  thanks very much"
