361048,pigeonfisher,2009-07-11 23:22:00,696,I think am taking this one in solo.  All the family is back home and the neighbours seem tied up.  I can't wait!!!
361049,misfish,2009-07-11 23:25:00,29133,Wouldnt miss this one Steve. Brock going to whop some ass.  GSP? Not to sure.Very good striker he is facing.  The bisblok is going down.  How the work out going?Still true?
361052,young_one,2009-07-11 23:32:00,620,will hit the bar later for the show. Can't believe how much they charge for UFC on pay per view
361054,misfish,2009-07-11 23:38:00,29133,  This one is worth it. Plus I can stay home and have some pops and be safe.
361055,pigeonfisher,2009-07-11 23:38:00,696,"Brian,  Big night for GSP...I have faith but it isn't blind!  Still working out strong.  Been doing a lot of running and have been hanging out just around 200lbs for a few weeks.  So I am down 55-60lbs depending on the day.  How about you?"
361058,steelhead hunter,2009-07-11 23:39:00,152,heading to my buddys place in about an hour should be a good show GSP and lesner should kick some major
361060,misfish,2009-07-11 23:43:00,29133,Im leveled off at 180 for the last 4 months..Just where I want to be.  Eating healthy.Thats the key.
361062,Mattitude,2009-07-12 00:17:00,155,Hate to say it but GSP may be going down tonight.  Either way it's gonna be one heck of a night.
361067,misfish,2009-07-12 00:35:00,29133,Matt you working and watching for free.LOL  Good to hear from ya bud.
361071,cuillerierk,2009-07-12 00:46:00,32,My predictions...  Lesnar by referee stoppage (1st round)  GSP by submission (he says he has something new in store for us) (2nd round)  Bisping by decision (even though I hope Henderson wins)  Belcher by knockout ( 2nd round)  Fitch by head kick (1st round)   Man this is going to be one great of a PPV event...!!!!  I Can't wait!!!
361073,Mattitude,2009-07-12 00:49:00,155,No we aren't allowed to show it so I booked the night off LOL
361076,Twocoda,2009-07-12 00:58:00,4130,MMA ...ANYTHING can happen  Shenko is the only one i would put my money on ( if he fought in the UFC)  I cant believe this is 100 th when i was at the 7th in Buffalo
361080,ctdd2006,2009-07-12 01:07:00,531,Mir looked great at the weigh in!  You never know in MMA.
361084,misfish,2009-07-12 01:19:00,29133,"Fitch is a hard one to call IMO. Hot and very cold at times.   None the less it,s going to be an awesome card."
361109,Terry,2009-07-12 02:44:00,14456,on the first fight the judges must have been watching a different fight then I watched
361111,ctdd2006,2009-07-12 02:50:00,531,what happened?
361127,misfish,2009-07-12 03:12:00,29133,"BIS BIS GONE. THATS WAS SO SWEET.  Remind me of that song,IT,S HAMMER TIME.LOL"
361128,misfish,2009-07-12 03:13:00,29133,  You ever fight? LOL It was the right decision.
361146,Terry,2009-07-12 03:53:00,14456,not  in my world  but george  won
361161,cuillerierk,2009-07-12 05:33:00,32," Akiyama did have the better takedowns, and ground game. But I do think it was really close and hard to call. I think they called it right. either way it was a great fight.  All 4 main card fights were awesome. I'm so glad Henderson knocked out Bisping, and that extra little shot was just icing on the cake.  UFC 100 totally lived up to the hype."
361167,Mattitude,2009-07-12 06:20:00,155,Absolutlely loved that Hendo KO.  Wow he still has it! Amazing!
