360159,kevinhiles,2009-07-09 16:51:00,22,"Hey,  I'm new to this forum and at the advice of another member I thought I would introduce myself.  I'm new to fishing. I went on a fishing trip with some friends near Prescott, Ontario (with borrowed equipment) and had an awesome time and caught a bunch of fish (smallmouth bass I think?).  Last week I bought my own rod and a little bit of tackle so I can get in more time fishing. I live in Burlington so most of the fishing I can do is around here unless I take the odd trip. So far I've been to the Burlington lift bridge near Hamilton. I didn't catch any fish but it appears to be a popular spot. Next, I'm going to try a place on the Grand River, near Caledonia my cousin told me about (I think it's a dam).  I want to go back to that place on the St. Lawrence river near Prescott. Between me and my four friends we must have caught 30 fish. Most of them were small but we caught the odd 4-5 pounder.  If I have any more luck, I'll let you know.  Cheers!"

360166,Rich Clemens,2009-07-09 17:29:00,3131,Welcome aboard.  A 4-5 LB bass ain't nothing to sneeze at.    You'll have more 'luck' and don't be shy about sharing your adventures with the community - whether you caught fish or not.
