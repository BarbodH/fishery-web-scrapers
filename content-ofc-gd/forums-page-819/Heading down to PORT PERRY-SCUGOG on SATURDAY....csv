I was just curious of the following....  1) How is the CRAPPIE fishing? 2) What are my odds of catching a MUSKY/PIKE there? **Never caught a MUSKY!**  and finally...  3) It's assumed that its going to rain tomorrow...Any tactics anyone can suggest in terms of fishing?  Thanks Folks! RoB"
360821,fish-miester,2009-07-11 02:49:00,864,"1) where abouts will you be fishing ? boat or shore?  2) last night I caught quite a few on pretty big luers fishing for walleye  3) there are no Pike, but there are musky, and for the most part they are around, tho i havnt hooked into any lately  4) depends what your fishing for?"
360853,Victor,2009-07-11 05:15:00,1609,haven't been fishing out that way so i don't know how it's been... but it's starting to get warm and the crappie will be harder to find.  I was just going to say it... then I realized fish-miester already mentioned that there's no Pike in Scugog.  Tactic for rain: wear a rainjacket lol.
360867,rbaquial,2009-07-11 07:57:00,968,LoL! Thanks Victor!  *Smartass* hahaha....  FISH-MIESTER - Answer to your questions...  I will be fishing from shore... would LIKE to tackle some CRAPPIE...but I'm open to other species!
360889,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-11 12:23:00,3761,"I was out there 2 weeks ago and caught a decent sized crappie off the shore in the weeds...may of been a quiescence though. As for Musky, your best bet would be the causeway unless they hand around in those sloppy weeds. Something came up so I wont be going there this Saturday but well maybe another time.  Good luck, Be sure to report on your day,  MTBF"
360927,fish-miester,2009-07-11 15:01:00,864,"i find musky around the port perry peir , as well have caught them behind the libary / birds eye park.  As for crappy i have found them all over, pier, boat launch , behind the library , and all over.   tho i dont always get the size i want, but those are just some areas u can try.  but good luck, it was pretty crummy here earlier. tho i think it has let up quite a bit"
