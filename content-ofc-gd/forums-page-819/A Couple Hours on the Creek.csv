First plans were to bike to a neighbouring town and fish some bass but I got lazy and the weather didn't look too great so I just headed down to my trout holes to see what would happen. Almost instantly with the magic jerkbait I was into an average sized brown.    Headed down river to check out a spot I rarely fish.. kinda like my favorite spot on the river that I don't want to ruin by fishing too much.. and I almost cried at the sight. There is an outflow from the sewage treatment plant that runs into the river upstream of my spot.. out of that outflow was some sort of red silt. It didn't stink like sewage, but it certainly wasn't a good thing. There were three people on cell phones calling the MOE, MNR and county when I got there so hopefully things will get fixed up... but the damage is already done. Everywhere downriver from there the bottom was covered in this reddish/orange silt, visibility in the water was ZILCH and obviously I didn't catch any fish down there.  Trying to clear the anger at the county for that crap I headed back up river to a tributary creek and played with one brown for quite some time that kept chasing the jerkbait but would not bite. I decided to move and cast upstream at him and rip it back fast, not give him time to think. First cast doing this the bait was smacked by the first speck I've ever caught out of this area. Not big by any means, but cool to see a speck so close to home anyway. He took some eye damage from the jerkbait but was released to grow bigger and hopefully make babies.      After that I toyed around at a few other spots and caught some chub minnows before deciding I was hungry and it was time to return home.  With the exception of the silt destruction downriver it was a good way to kill off a couple of hours. I've grown very fond of the inland trout fishing since I moved here. Very peaceful. A great way to clear your mind and get in touch with nature.  But dang, I miss bass fishing. lol"

Because of the way you were holding it there it very likely wont live anyway.  Trout are not as ""durable"" as bass so you have to take extra precautions with them in order to preserve the fishery.  Never the less, I know you are an experieced fishermen and probably know this so dont take this the wrong way.  Just want my kids (unborn) to have strong fisheries as well!  Cheers and great job!"
361326,Rich,2009-07-13 00:36:00,3927,"Yessir, I can't hide the fact that I love fresh BBQ brown trout. Though after seeing the sewage incident today, I don't think I'll be keeping anymore. Not that I'm worried about pollutants.. but that is going to take out a lot of fish I'd bet. Need the rest to breed!"
