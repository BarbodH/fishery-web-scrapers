360809,Skud,2009-07-11 02:16:00,739,I have been fishing Balsam for about 15 years but only on the weekend. As a weekend warrior I only have a good day of fishing every 2nd year. But this time I will be camping at the park from Monday till Thurs this coming week and will be spending 8-12 hours out on the water every day chasing those pesky musky and walleye. I might even catch my first pike there. I will give a report on my return.

360878,Terry,2009-07-11 10:55:00,14456,"I have never caught a pike there  good luck, I hope you catch a lot more muskie then pike..."
