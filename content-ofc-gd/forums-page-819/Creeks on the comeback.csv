I was quite surprised to catch a nice little brook trout (or maybe a small brown.. not  too sure on my trout species) .. around 7-8"" .. wish I had my camera with me .. the colors were beauty .. I hope to catch more of them in the future .. gonna have to remember the camera next time .. but then again if I bring the camera I probably wouldn't have caught it"

We would get dropped off at the outskirts of town- me with my CTC cane fly pole with 8' of line tied to it and a can of worms and walk the creeks back home. Simpler, better times."
