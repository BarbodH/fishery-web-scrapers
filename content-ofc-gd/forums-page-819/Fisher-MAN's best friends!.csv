She was hit by a van at the tender age of 6 mo. and lost her left front leg, but it hasn't slowed her down much at all! She's Border Collie and half Australian Shepard, she's very protective of her mommy and daddy... and it would be illadvised for anyone to try to enter the house or her fenced backyard without me or Ol' Yeller present!  Her name is Miss Bubba.  .. any dog that eats mud isn't going to mind biting a strange people!!!  ... and this is what she looks like all cleaned up! "

Fish Hound really can't stand the water and gets bored standing still for 2 minutes, so trips with him are limited to tripping in the back lakes.  The Puggle Of Doom LOVES the water, but can't swim to save her life (literally!).  She is also an emissary of Satan and constantly plotting world domination.  Here she is just before unleashing her fury on a hapless cat.......the carnage that was left is too graphic to post.  "

360072,Bitsmith2k,2009-07-09 12:58:00,396," artificial insemination, 99% of the births are caesarian, relatively small litters... for the most part, you're hopefully paying for a responsible breeder...  typically the high price tag is just the start too.. i'm sure Chrispy can attest to some of the health probs they're prone to.. even though he's not good with the heat, snores louder than Ted & The Gadget, and is more subborn than my mother in law, i'll never own another breed.."

But i think he realized the only thing telling him to do so was the money he thought hed make doing it, and after some thought, and a little birdie (myself) telling him he didnt know the first thing about breeding .........he dropped the idea lol"

Up until a few years ago he was very active and enjoyed fishing with me in the boat...Arnie would give any fish that dared come into the boat a severe tongue lashing and then afterwards a good lick session just to make sure it stayed still  These days he is enjoying his retirement and likes nothing more than to deligate and air his complaints to the rest of our little family...  This is Sam. Some of you have met him already at Lakair. He was the famous air dog !!! At home he like to play with his new brother Waldo which I will introduce to you as well...Sam Loves the water obviously and seems to have taken well to boating...His trip to the G2G Lakiar this year was full of new things like fishing, slimy fish,dock jumping and sharp fishing hooks,youch they are prickly on my tongue  Here he is once again in his glory and newest found pastime,dock jumping !!!! Gonna have to build me a dock beside his pool  Here is our latest addition to our furry family. His name is Waldo and he came to us by a rescue....He has turned out well and has become Sams best friend and companion. They rough house all day,eat sleep and do all the other dog stuff together....    Cherrs !!"

I grabbed her as she was going under the boat, toward the prop.  She loves swimming, but she's not used to jumping in from that height.  So when she hit the water, she sank about 1 foot.  Before she could surface, the boat was on top of her.  I had to reach under the boat, and pull her out.  Iâ€™ve never reacted to fast in my life.  She was coughing up water for 5 minutes after that.   That got my blood flowin'"

359789,bigugli,2009-07-08 15:00:00,6138," The fish thievin dogs have life jackets. Although they can swim, most dogs can only last 5-10 minutes in the water before they tire out (retrievers don't count). Had one dog that sank after jumping off the boat. he could not keep his head above water. Lesson learnt."

Sometimes she'l jump in the water and swim away from shore, and not look back untill she's 100' out.  Then she panics, and tries to rush back in.  Only to turn around and do the exact same thing again."
