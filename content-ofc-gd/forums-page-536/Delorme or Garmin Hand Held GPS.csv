585358,GregF2,2011-05-21 12:20:00,46,"Looking for feedback on Delorme PN-60 or Garmin 62s hand held gps.  Would be used on Rice Lake and also Lake St Clair.  I am curious as to which one has the better set of lake maps, etc..  I do not own a boat, so don't own another GPS.  Thanks for the feedback."
585500,ah_long,2011-05-22 05:15:00,354,I don't think the Garmin takes Navionics... not sure about the Delorme
585502,Roy,2011-05-22 09:53:00,13728,"As Ah_long said, Garmin is not Navionics compatible, Delorme is compatible."
585503,Terry,2011-05-22 10:31:00,14456,"Garmin is topo Canada and MapSource compatible, Delorme is not compatible."
585513,GregF2,2011-05-22 11:44:00,46,"So, since the Delorme takes Navionics is that the way to go for Rice Lake and Lake St Clair maps?  The Garmin lake maps would not be as good?"
585519,Terry,2011-05-22 12:09:00,14456,"I for one really like garmin in handheld gps  they have topo maps there are 3 different companies that make them for garmin units  the bluecharths maps work on garmin and have maps for them TrakMarine do hard to find maps for lakes for garmin  plus there are road maps that work on garmin   and   a little google and most people can find all the maps for garmin free on the internet  having said that I really don't know Garmin 62s, I have had the garmin GPSMAP 76Cx  the problem is you wanted a comparison of Delorme and Garmin and most likely no one or not many here has the delorme  Delorme or Garmin "
585526,BillM,2011-05-22 13:07:00,17367," Garmin takes BlueCharts (at least my GPSMap 62 does)..  Garmin over the Delorme, especially if it's the 62s."
585567,Raf,2011-05-22 16:32:00,3495,"i would go garmin.  the difference between navionics and garmin's mapsource is that in the end, there is no difference - at least in terms of coverage/detail.  they are both sourced from the same hydrographic/topographic info."
585569,ah_long,2011-05-22 16:47:00,354,"Like another poster said, if you look hard enough, you can find maps for free for the Garmin..  Costco has the 60csx on sale for $199.99 (online, no membership required)..  If you plan to use it for fishing, I can tell you a GPS alone would not be effective especially if you're looking for drop offs. You still need a sonar type system to pin point particular structures."
585670,GregF2,2011-05-23 01:11:00,46,"I would be using it to mark spots and general depth information.  Would probably use it more ice fishing, but some regular fishing too.  The Garmin 62s is on sale at REI (US) for $279 right now.  Seems like a good deal, so maybe I will get that one.  Thanks all for the help."
