585064,Scott S,2011-05-19 22:54:00,203,"I am going to try for whitefish for the first time and would appreciate a little help. I am going to be launching at Innisfill beach park. How long will it take to get to Willow Beach? Do I go in between Fox and Snake or is there a better way. What depth? do you start shallow and work your way deeper. Any info would be great, like I said this is the first time for me out there. I have a 16ft crestliner with a 50hp merc. I should be okay as long as the wind isn't too bad right!!  Thanks Scooter"
585085,Terry,2011-05-20 00:20:00,14456,go between the 2 islands  about 8 km and you will see all the boats
585112,12footspringbok,2011-05-20 01:14:00,459, Once you get a lil closer to the pack pull out your binoculars if you can spot a boat catching lots pull up as close as you can drop anchor and start fishing.
585119,BillM,2011-05-20 01:31:00,17367," I can't stand people that do this, lol!!  But yeah, find the floatilla and join the fun."
585120,BFSC Kevin,2011-05-20 01:33:00,1351, ....
585121,glen,2011-05-20 01:37:00,2641,Maybe just ask if you can tie off to there boat.  It will save you putting an anchor down.
585132,Guest gbfisher,2011-05-20 02:10:00,0,  you can be anchor boy tomorrow.
585170,beginner,2011-05-20 04:04:00,542,or leave ur boat and hop in to that boat save you the trouble... )
585186,Terry,2011-05-20 09:48:00,14456," for the record, I didn't tell him to go to the boats....... I prefer to be a km away from the pack..........  but I have years of way points and that's where I fish, whether there are boats there or not"
585190,12footspringbok,2011-05-20 10:33:00,459,LOL sorry guys should have used the  icon instead LOL. Ya its sad but what i descibed seems to be common pratice. My buddy and I fish miles away from the JP/Willow beach zoo and still catch fish. Imagine that. Hopefully be out tomorrow morning balls deep trolling around the north end of the lake....
585198,Guest gbfisher,2011-05-20 11:50:00,0,  Imagine that eh?!?!..
585227,BillM,2011-05-20 14:09:00,17367,"I still got all my sneaky ice GPS way points for Sat, should be a great day!!!   No way we'll be sitting in the middle of the floatilla of rubes!"
585243,ohhenrygsr,2011-05-20 15:59:00,947, Always looking for an Edge ehh Glen
585317,misfish,2011-05-20 23:51:00,29133,"Dang,if I only had my boat,I would be the only guy jigg,n them up here in the bay."
585322,Rustic-Fisher,2011-05-21 00:44:00,826," Will take ya 10 min max, from IBP, stay away from the crowds and you should have steady hook ups. We got em good today! Good luck!"
585525,BillM,2011-05-22 13:06:00,17367,"Turned off yesterday, we ran around the entire lake and got one fish for our efforts.  Saw one other boat land a fish.  I should have run out to Slyville!!!!"
585527,Terry,2011-05-22 13:07:00,14456,that is not what I wanted to hear I still have not made it out there yet  waiting for my big boat to get fixed.....
585530,BillM,2011-05-22 13:24:00,17367,"Sorry Terry, I wish it was a better day out there, trust me  Still lots of time though, they'll turn back on."
585551,Guest gbfisher,2011-05-22 14:58:00,0,"   Hey Terry.  I had a buddy who did very well yesterday away from the packs. He found a school of active fish is all. Luck of th draw. As Bill said, there's lots of time still."
585554,BillM,2011-05-22 15:11:00,17367,"We played the same game.  Outside of the packs, infront of the packs, behind the packs, lol.  If you find an active school of fish you'll do just fine.  Unlucky day I guess, we all have them!  (Although I did clean up on rock bass and perch at the end of the day, lol)"
585566,Sinker,2011-05-22 16:24:00,8692,"My buddies also got into them pretty good. Nowhere near the pack at all. Same deal, found a lucky school that wanted to play. Otherwise, it was a pretty slow day from what I hear.  S."
585595,Cudz,2011-05-22 21:09:00,2652,I got out for a little bit after work on Friday night and found fish but they would not commit.  Only things biting were herring.  Got a bunch of those..  Mmmmm.  Love the way they taste. Just kidding.  We threw them all back.
585702,BillM,2011-05-23 02:11:00,17367,"Chris, did you and your wife walk by my place 2 days ago?  I swear I saw you across the street, lol."
585732,Cudz,2011-05-23 04:02:00,2652,Nope. If I saw you I would say hey. Been busy swimming in pool for past 3 days.  Love this weather
