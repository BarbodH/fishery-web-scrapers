585208,jediangler,2011-05-20 12:43:00,1923,If you are in the conservation area those special regs don't apply. You can use live bait and you can use multiple hooks with barbs.

585441,Pigeontroller,2011-05-21 22:25:00,2793,My favourite level was around 70 CMS when I Kayaked...Some friends would paddle it at flows up to 200 CMS!!!
