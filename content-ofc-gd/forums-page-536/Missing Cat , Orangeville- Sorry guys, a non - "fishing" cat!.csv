585087,irishfield,2011-05-20 00:24:00,26272,"Brother left for Kazakhstan, to fly 319/320/321 Airbus, on Wednesday night and his cat got out on his wife on Friday. Hasn't been seen since and he's pretty bummed out about it. I've always wanted to take Winston fishing... but Murray would really just like to find him in his favourite chair when he gets home for a few days (in about 2 months). Working 6 weeks on 2 weeks off over there after he completes their (soviet) idea of ground school.  I know there's a bunch of lads here from Orangeville... so I thought it was a shot in the dark to post here.  I took the phone number off... as I didn't think a women home alone was a great person to give the # out for (especially in Orangeville). If you have a sighting PM me asap.  Thanks..... joke all you want, but it's the least I can do considering the effort Murray has put in for Jennifer the last 6+ months.  Wayne "
585094,Terry,2011-05-20 00:40:00,14456,at first I thought you were kidding...I was expecting you to show something wiggling like it's ears or something  but I do hope you find it
585113,flash67,2011-05-20 01:14:00,28,"Where abouts in Orangeville?? I live up near Montgomery village, what area should I be looking for this cat?? I do in home jobs for Future Shop, I'm on the road in town all day basically."
585116,irishfield,2011-05-20 01:22:00,26272,Buckingham Street... It backs onto the big green space. Don't know how to describe where it is...other than S/W quarter of Orangeville.  Just mapquested and it says Montgomery Village about 6 streets above it... You get to it off Spencer THANKS!
585125,kickingfrog,2011-05-20 01:49:00,8333,Is it even possible for a guy who works on and flies planes to loose his man card?  Good luck with the search.

585917,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-23 20:29:00,4399,Every cat in Orangeville uses my backyard as their own personal litter box Wayne so I`ll keep my eyes open!
585918,irishfield,2011-05-23 20:34:00,26272,Thanks Gord... this lads probably wondering what to do... he's strictly an indoor fella. No sign of him so far...
585924,Rattletrap2,2011-05-23 20:45:00,1652,"Wayne, I'm definitely not a cat lover by any stretch....but for its sake, I hope someone has picked it up and is feeding it. I know that is not a nice thing for the owners, but indoor cats would be really out of sorts outside fending for themselves. MY Wife's cat is a similar colour and is always indoors. It gets out from time to time out of curiosity,and if someone does not latch the screen door, but returns quickly."
