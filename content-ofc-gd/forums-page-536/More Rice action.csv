Was hoping to catch some crappie but that wasn't happening. Started working a few weed edges mid lake. Moving slow so the kids could still fish so the action wasn't really happening. Ripping a jig or often helping the kids out with a worm and bobber or harness - there was no hardcore fishing.  It was real slow to start but things finally started working at Long Island. Finally got the first taste.   Action was furious for a while. Kids had a blast! Lots of pan fish.    A couple of eaters   And a few more under the slot size. Awesome day to be on the water.  Best part though was that I was testing my 6 year old to see how long he would last and he had a blast for 5 hours which is by far a record for him!. He just kept asking to stay and keep trying"
