585870,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-05-23 17:41:00,0,"While May Long weekend was long an untouchable weekend for me, the past 3 years I haven't made it out fishing due to hectic family/work life.  This year, I budgeted my time very carefully in the weeks leading up to ""the 24"" and was able to run away for the weekend.  Friday evening, we raced out of town at 5pm with a hot pizza to eat in the car.  We arrived at the lake at 7pm, loaded our gear into the canoe, and paddled down the large lake to the first campsite we found.  With little time to spare before dark we had our tent set up, and our Heineken mini-kegs tapped.  Party on Wayne!  Saturday morning I woke up to the sound of the birds at about 5:15 and made coffee (more like a 50/50 mix of irish cream and coffee...   )  We were on the water by 6:30.  After passing through the usual spring time haunts sans success, we started to slowly move deeper in search of some fish on the Humminbird.  Strangely enough, it seemed that despite the ice having just came off 2 weeks previous, many of the fish were holding in their summer haunts.  2-3oz of weight and some guesstimated line counts and we started to find fish.. Well, my canoe partner did anyways!  I couldn't buy a fish!  In the mean time I watch him pull several fish from the depths..   That night after dinner, and a thorough ribbing from my chum about how I hadn't caught anything, I wandered down to the shore of our campsite to test out the new light action brookie rod i had built.  Fish were boiling all over the shallows and i figured i HAD to be able to catch something.  Sure enough, my first cast at a fish boiling through a school of baitfish and I caught a very nice little brookie.  THE BLACK FURY STRIKES AGAIN! Even better, I caught a laker from shore ten minutes later in the exact same spot!  pardon my surly face... black flies were a little bit ... intense!   After hearing reports of severe weather watches saturday night, Sunday morning we decided to ""pull the pin"" on the trip a day early.  We took down camp by 9am, and dropped all of our stuff off at the landing.  We figured we could fish right up until the weather hit as long as we didn't stray too far.  We fished a backbay nearby for specks but caught nothing but lakers all morning.  Apparently the fish had decided to travel shallow and were smashing our brookie tackle.  Catching lakers on ultralight gear was one of the funnest experiences I've ever had.  Nothing huge, but all fish were fiesty!   All in all we got 10 lakers and a brookie and put a serious dent in heineken supplies in northern Ontario.  Thanks for reading!  "
