585687,Arty,2011-05-23 01:52:00,12,New to North Bay fishing and looking for some spots to try around the area?  Any help would be great.
585837,Joeytier,2011-05-23 15:06:00,3990,There's no fish around here.  Quit while you're still ahead.
585879,Rod Caster,2011-05-23 18:13:00,5784,i tried kings landing today.... but no action. thts a decent shore spot later in the season.
585964,Mike01,2011-05-23 22:45:00,378,"try off sunset point, just off Lakeshore dr. behind Churchhills.  The government dock(King's landing) is also decent."
585995,Nipfisher,2011-05-24 00:31:00,2449, x2. Would be exactly where I would tell you to go.  You can also try around the Lavase launch. You'll find pike in the river.
586059,Arty,2011-05-24 02:35:00,12,I will be sure to give them all a try.  Glad to hear there are some spots around North Bay.  I went to Sturgeon Falls today but nothing doing at the train bridge.
586071,Nipfisher,2011-05-24 02:51:00,2449,"  Arty, on the weekend there were guys catching 40-60 white bass at the train bridge. We caught 5 in the 2 days but day one we only had worms. Need minnows for them."
586073,Grimace,2011-05-24 02:59:00,2020,Are you guys insane?   Why would you share information with a Bills fan on an open forum?
