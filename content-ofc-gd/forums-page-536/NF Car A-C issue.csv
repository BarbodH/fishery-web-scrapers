585688,10point,2011-05-23 01:53:00,165,So i have temperature slide knobs for each side of my 05 Trailblazer that light up when the dash lights are on. The lights on the left side knob recently went out which I thought was no big deal. Well today I ran the air and it appears I only have cold air coming out of the right side. Any ideas? Could it be related?

""lights on the left side knob recently went out"" Might be related to the left side not having cold air. Start by checking fuses, then the switches and wires. Good luck."
