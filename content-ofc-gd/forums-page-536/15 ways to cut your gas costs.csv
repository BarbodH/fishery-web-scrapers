584860,oldphart,2011-05-19 12:28:00,665,"Garry Marr  May 17, 2011 – 10:18 AM ET | Last Updated: May 17, 2011 10:33 AM ET  When it comes to saving money on gas, who would know better than an oil and gas executive?  Chris Faulkner, chief executive of Breitling Oil and Gas Ltd., offers these tips:  1. Fill up your tank on Wednesday or Thursday, gas prices go up on the weekend. Don't buy gas on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday unless it's an emergency.  2. Don't let your car idle, either when you warm it up or when you're at a standstill. If you're going to be standing for more than a minute, running your engine wastes more gas than restarting the engine.  3. Buy gas when it's cooler during the day (like the early morning or at night) to reduce gas evaporation.  4. Remove unnecessary items in your car. Every 250 extra pounds eats up an extra mile per gallon of gas.  5. Avoid the convenient gas station on the side of the highway as you drive home from work which can be up to US$.15 more per gallon.  6. Save money with self-service.  7. Drive less – combine errands, carpool, and plot out the shortest route with a driving website beforehand.  It may sound obvious but it is often overlooked.  8. Check for traffic and detours online or on the radio prior to beginning your drive to avoid wasteful backtracking and idling.  9. Keep your windows closed when driving on the highway. Open windows can reduce your gas mileage by as much as 10%.  In stop-and-go traffic, open the windows and turn off the air conditioning to save more money.  10. Rent fuel-efficient cars when you travel and research reasonably priced places to buy gas before you leave.  11. Confirm with your mechanic what octane gasoline your car's engine really needs.  Most car engines do not require high octane though the manual will say its ""recommended.""  12. Download a Gas App for your phone.  If you have a Smartphone, there are plenty of free apps that help you find the cheapest gas near your destination. GasBuddy makes it easy with its free app, and Mapquest has an online finder for gas prices.  13. Buy Discount Gas Gift Cards – Did you know you don't have to pay full price for a gift card?  14. Be loyal to one gas company and get rewarded with its cash-back credit card reward program.  ~~And my favorite #15 Care a length of rubber hose, a 5 Gal can, and some strong breath mints"
584866,Fish Farmer,2011-05-19 12:42:00,2234,"This is like telling every one to buy a small car. We don't burn as much gas now so we have to put the price up because we don't sell as much. Just like Hydro with the smart meter. Just another stupid excuse. But I like #15, now to find a CEO"
584871,pics,2011-05-19 12:58:00,1268,Get the gas for #15 from a CEO's big SUV and you win twice.....
584872,Billy Bob,2011-05-19 13:04:00,5865,Park it and walk......and when you can't hypermile whenever possible...it WORKS.
584883,Governator,2011-05-19 13:53:00,879,"How does a gas gift card lower your cost?  Wouldn't you still have to swipe it at the pump based on on how much gasoline you use?  If you buy a $20 gift card doesn't it just equal $20 worth of gas at the pump?  I've never seen a $20 gas gift card for $15.  They would be sold out in seconds.  Not to mention you probably pay tax on the card itself, costing you more."
584894,Joeytier,2011-05-19 14:15:00,3990,# 7 is clearly the only effective one of those tips.  I wouldn't expect to see a CEO of an oil company encourage me to ride my bike to work every day.
584897,scugpg,2011-05-19 14:25:00,1373,Find a gas station that sells gas without Ethanol in it. Its ridiculous they are putting this in the fuel now and it lowers mpg
584899,mk2vr6,2011-05-19 14:30:00,14,There is so much misinformation in here its ridiculous.  I can't believe how many people believe this email forwarding trash.
584915,Billy Bob,2011-05-19 15:28:00,5865,Why here at OFC we believe everything we read on the internet....  If it's on the net it's got to be true....right...
584949,Fish Farmer,2011-05-19 16:52:00,2234,"I see you haven't been here long. It's a joke, don't take things so serious."
585028,splashhopper,2011-05-19 21:15:00,2931,16) Take my wife's toyota echo to go fishing and leave her the Dodge Ram to get groceries in

585201,corvette1,2011-05-20 12:18:00,1765,i don't think the wifes toyota is towing my pro-v
585206,splashhopper,2011-05-20 12:40:00,2931,"17) the easiest, quickest way to fuel savings is to adjust the nut behind the wheel!"
585207,perodimi,2011-05-20 12:42:00,124,"  Just a thought on what it costs to carry extra weight. Quite often we'll take an extra 45 minutes worth of fuel on a long flight which equates to about 4000kg. By the time we reach our destination, we will have burned more than half of that just to carry it. That means you'll only have about 20 minutes left of the original 45 burned into thin air. It still boggles my feable mind."
585217,beginner,2011-05-20 13:33:00,542,save gas???? buy a HORSE hahahahaha
585235,fishindevil,2011-05-20 14:50:00,6254,"like the one i read a few months ago it said: drive down hill whenever possible,and avoid going uphill !!!"

585548,Tybo,2011-05-22 14:53:00,1373,The only way to save gas. Buy a diesel.
585556,kickingfrog,2011-05-22 15:21:00,8333, My cars use gasoline not gas.  Behind the scenes of a gasoline company:  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/car-life/road-sage/high-gas-prices-dont-fret-fuelishly-were-here-to-help/article2026925/
585558,nofish4me,2011-05-22 15:32:00,404, I'd do that for sure! Dodge vs Toyota : Toyota wins every time.
