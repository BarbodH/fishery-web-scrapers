585175,John Bacon,2011-05-20 04:54:00,3277,There was mention on Q107 this morning that Markham may get an NHL team?  I highly doubt the info but was wondering if anyone else had heard anything.

585228,BillM,2011-05-20 14:09:00,17367,No need for another NHL team in Ontario.
585242,GBW,2011-05-20 15:10:00,8460,the plan years ago was to move the leafs to Woodbine and 7 to make access to game easier but then came the ACC and Raptors.

585376,Roy,2011-05-21 15:20:00,13728,"It'd be a great rivalry between Markham and Toronto though. Markham would just be another team to blow them out of the water. Hey that's it, they could be the ""Markham Leaf blowers""!"
585388,bushart,2011-05-21 15:55:00,2628,May make for a funny town sign though Roy---picture it  MARKHAM...home of the leaf blowers and weed eaters
