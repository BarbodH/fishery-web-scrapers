For the rest of the day. I tried everything from 3 fow to 20 fow, weed beds to shoals, cranks to worms and even minnows but I couldn't land another walleye. I did get into some fantastic blue gill fishing in one spot though using a crappie rig cast after cast and all nice and big.  Talked to the guy at the lodge, he said pretty much the same thing, walleye were turned off. can't figure out why because the sky was over cast, there was a light chop, even the evening bite didn't happen which is very unusual especially off our dock. Oh well next time maybe!"
