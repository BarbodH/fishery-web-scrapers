Well, two of my guys skipped our May trip in 2010 and are showing the same level of excitement on this trip.  The two fishermen have changed underwear twice already on this walleye opener. Have they been saving up or what?"

585540,TennesseeGuy,2011-05-22 14:22:00,957,"First day excitement has passed and we'll have cleaner boat seats today.  East wind gave us only a fair walleye bite yesterday, but pike cooperated with us.  Pike were trying to steal our walleyes as we brought them in.  Much more than usual.  It was an active day for pike on one of our favorite points."
