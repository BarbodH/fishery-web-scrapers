583883,Muskieman,2011-05-17 00:36:00,2472,"Closer to home than you may think Wayne  http://www.ontariosasquatch.com/#/nipissing/4521082945  YEAR: 1994  SEASON: Unknown  PROVINCE: Ontario  COUNTRY: Canada  LOCATION DETAILS: Canada, Ontario, Temagami  OBSERVED: My brother and I were riding in a small boat when I noticed something on the shore. It was about 40 metres away, but we saw a 7 foot tall humanoid that looked completely brown scooping up water into its mouth with its hand. Then it looked at us and walked away.  OTHER WITNESSES: We were fishing. Trolling to be exact  ENVIRONMENT: It was in a bay off of lake Temagami. There was thick forest all around it. -------------------------------------------------------------------- YEAR: 2005  SEASON: Summer  MONTH: August  PROVINCE: Ontario  COUNTRY: Canada  NEAREST TOWN: Temagami  NEAREST ROAD: Highway 11  OBSERVED: I am 45 years old, my son is 18. Last summer on a camping trip to Temagami, Ontario we had a most intense hour of probable contact with numerous Sasquatch. I'd been reading your website daily for a few months at that point so I was aware of certain things I otherwise wouldn't have been. I can't help but come to the conclusion that Sasquatch inhabit areas that Man has destroyed and then moved on, such as deforested areas and strip mined areas. We were in such an area at the time of these occurences. You can actually drive right to this particular area. On the narrow dirt road in there were many numerous tree snaps (mostly birch) 15 or so feet off the ground. Trees at least 8"" across, not tiny ones. When we stopped the truck we startled a huge red fox, who ran away over an entire field of mined piled boulders. My son and his girlfriend got out of the truck and took off running in the direction that the fox ran, over the piled boulders. I slowly and much more carefully made my way up the side of the boulders. When I got to the top I could see them heading towards the woods at the other side of the field of boulders about a quarter of a mile away. I became acutley aware of loud tree tapping noises from the woods on the other side of the field of rocks. You know when you're being watched and we were. This was a very desolate area. When the kids finally returned my son's girlfriend told me that someone or something had been throwing stones at them but they couldn't figure out from which direction. Hmmmmmm. I wonder who that could have been. The kids proceeded to run down the road in front of where I'd parked the truck as there were some abandoned buildings to an old mine. I went to the truck to get my camera, when I turned around the kids were way down the road, yet I could hear loud running footfalls behind some trees off to my right (somewhere between me and the kids). Anyway a number of other stange noises and such happened while we were there. At the bottom of a very old wooden staircase there was a huge mound of what looked like crap. It would have probably filled a 35 gallon fishtank. I joked that it looked like Sasquatch crap at the time and my son of course just said ""ya right"". So half jokingly I picked up a rock about twice the size of my fist and lobbed it down the stairs at the blob expecting it to just bouce off a pile of dirt. Well, it didn't bounce off. It sank a few inches into this mound with a splat sound. We just all looked at each other and all said ""oh crap"". It was either the largest pile of axle grease I've ever seen or it was genuine. We didn't go any closer, as there was a huge hole broken through some wooden floor boards only a few feet away from it that most likely led down into the old abandoned mine. I think I may even have a picture of it, as we took a few that afternoon of this strange location. I know exactly where this location is. We are going back again this summer probably in August.  ALSO NOTICED: The sound of something very large crashing through the bush towards our location. Stopped just short of a small swampy area. Nothing appeared and the sound stopped. Inside buildings it was pitch black but noises could be heard and it was obvious that something was running around inside. When we would look in one open door the sound moved to the other side of the building. This happened at every opening we looked in. There was also a gravel area that looked like it was once a parking lot perhaps. There was an obstruction in the trees that appeared to have been used as a hunters blind.  OTHER WITNESSES: My son, his girlfriend and myself.  OTHER STORIES: There is supposedly stories of Sasquatch in Temagami.  TIME AND CONDITIONS: Bright sunny afternoon. Very hot day.  ENVIRONMENT: Mixed deciduous and evergreen forested area. Small man made lake, likely from where many of the rocks and boulders originally came from. Unimaginably large area of nothing but piled boulders and rocks of every size and shape. A few city blocks in size at least.  Follow-up investigation report:  I spoke with the writer/witness over the phone and found him to be very genuine in nature and excited about the incidents he experienced. He is an avid fisherman and has traveled around various remote areas of northern Ontario.  There was not much extra to add to this original report because he was so thorough. However, he did mention a few more important details.  The trees that were broken were snapped off at about the 15 - 20 foot mark. He believes there were about 20 trees broken in this fashion with the tops missing.  The wood knocking that he heard lasted on and off for approximately 20 minutes and appeared to be about 1/2 mile away.  A couple of days prior to the above reported incident, the writer/witness went fishing with his son approximately 20 - 30 km from the report location. They had parked their vehicle on a bridge and then gone down to the river's edge to fish. They noticed across the river was a crude structure made up of woven sticks. The son went across the river to investigate it. His son walked along a narrow trail and searched the immediate area. Upon returning back along the same trail he found, to his amazement, a large stick ( 1 inch diameter x 8 feet long ) sticking in the ground, like a spear, in the trail. He knows it was absolutely not there when he walked the path just minutes before. He pulled out the stick and took it home. They still have it."

584127,dsn,2011-05-17 15:41:00,1018,I love to watch shows like monster quest and destination truth which tries to find evedience of such creatures. Some of the things or info they find is surprising.  All I can say is it interesting stuff. And it is possible I guess.   karper  
585380,ehg,2011-05-21 15:35:00,2666,Found the most incredible footage of a Sasquatch Whoever posted video is wrong in thinking it is a gorilla. There are no gorillas in North America. 
583554,Harrison,2011-05-16 12:48:00,2202,"Since a youngster I have been intrigued with the thought of the beast actually roaming our wilderness.  However as I get older, I find it much harder to believe that there is no actually physical evidence.  I watched a show on this topic last night and it got me thinking again.  The eye witness accounts makes one wonder.  Are you a believer or not?"
583558,Roy,2011-05-16 12:58:00,13728,"Yeah, that stuff intriqued me for the first 3 years of my life, then I learned to read. Eyewitnesses you say?Hmmm, must be true then. Maybe I'd better take another look.  edit: Don't get too serious with this stuff, Phil. Fox news will pick it up."

583570,Harrison,2011-05-16 13:10:00,2202,Hmmmmm....  Closest I have come to an eyewitness account personally was very late one night in the middle of the bush.  Turns out it was just my buddie Vinny with his shirt off looking for a spot to tinkle.  Scared the Molson outta me.
583573,Afraz,2011-05-16 13:15:00,250,"In Bigfoot and his buddies, No.  In Nessie (loch ness monster) or the like thereof, Yes.  There are still parts of the ocean unexplored or not frequented by human beings, who knows what lies in deep cold lakes, and oceans.  Heck there is a blob of chemicals in Lake Ontario, so why not a prehistoric remnant like the coeclananth (spelling), sturgeon or gar ?"
583656,troutologist,2011-05-16 15:47:00,951,"I am intruiged more by the phenomena surrounding the sightings than the thought of a bipedal primate living undetected in North America. If you spend enough time in the bush, you are apt to see and hear some very odd things. What are people seeing or think they are seeing? Is the idea of sasquatch a part of human mythology across many cultures? The monster lurking in the shadows or night?  I am curious about the way if there is a report of someone seeing one, how a number of others see it in fairly short order. Not too different than the problem bear reporting in Ontario, sure there are more bears in the woods, but does this increase in population corrleate to the increase in reported incidents, or is the increase in reporting due to the spotlight being placed on the issue...  Few things are more entertaining than reading eye witness reports (ie. ""....me a Cooter was out drinkin' and shinin' deers when we seen..."")  That said, a couple of buddies have some stories that are very difficult to explain the occurances.  I'm interested in hearing more thoughts/stories on this."

583680,Millhouse2020,2011-05-16 16:38:00,152,"I think I watched part of the same program, didnt see the last 1/2 hour.  I have always been intrigued by this and other unexplained phenomena.  I'm not sure I am a believer but I don't write it off completely.  Good point about the oceans earlier.  There are vast expanses of un/under explored wilderness as well, in this country and elsewhere.  I once read a statisic on the thousands of planes that are missing and unaccounted for in the north american wilderness and it gets you thinking.  People say, if they do exist, how come we have never even found one dead.  Ok, fair enough.  There are lots of bears in the bush, lots more than perhaps Sasquatch, have anyone of us ever come accross a dead bear???  I know I haven't, nor has anyone I know.  Could a large primate still exist in the wild of north america undiscovered?  I think there is a possibilty, but its a small one and keeps getting smaller by the day with human encroachment, our wild spaces shrinking slowly and without definitive proof yet.  As technology gets better, you would think it would be harder and harder for a creature like that to hide.  That said, many of the stories are compelling and pique my interest.  What is really interesting to me is that the story/legend has existed for so long, in aboriginal culture here and other cultures around the world.  Is there really something going on or is it a common thread in our human DNA to explain some unidentifiable wild creature as a sasquatch, yeti, whatever...  Here is a question, if you ran accross one hunting, would you kill it in order to prove its existence or would you let be?  Would you tell anyone and possibly be labelled a quck or would you keep it a secret?"
583684,Harrison,2011-05-16 16:48:00,2202, I'd wack it but with my luck they'd be filming an episode of candid camera.  I found it interesting the two witness accounts that happened with in a kilometer of each other and a hour or so between them.

If it is so easy to find things out west how could the story in the link below have happened? It took seven weeks to find her and they knew they were travellig from their home to Vegas? OH that's right the search was hampered by the simple fact that there are thousands and thousands of acres of untouched wilderness from Alaska to Mexico along the mountain ranges...  The thing I found interesting from the bit of the show I caught was that there was a man sized ape that they recently discovered in the Congo. ""New"" to science but the woman credited with the discovery and 5 other homonoids I believe, said that the tribes who have lived by it had been telling stories about it for hundreds of years.... Which she always considers a sign that it might prove to be true. Tribes having lore about a ""creature"" sound familiar at all to anyone else?  Do I believe in Bigfoot myself nope but I would like to be corrected LOL. I liked the comment about cougars in the thread too.... Reminded me I was just informed, by a very concerned citizen the week before last, that the MNR is releasing rattle snakes nearby (less than 5 miles from my front door) because they will eat the over abundance of turkey eggs. Can't wait to hear the first offical report of a sighting. I am shocked one of the MNR employees hasn't tweeted about it yet.  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2011/05/07/bc-woman-rescued-nevada-penticton.html"
