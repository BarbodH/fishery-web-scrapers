The rainy start to the week slowed the action but the last couple of days have turned the fish on and I have heard of 50-70 fish days for several groups.  Get your button, grab your rod and get out on Rice Lake. Sounds like everything is pointing to a great long weekend.      If your in the area don't forget the family fishing day tomorrow May 21 from 10-4 at Golden Beach Resort. Family fun and smiles available to everyone."
585348,adempsey,2011-05-21 04:56:00,1498,Good to hear!   It was pretty decent last year and was wondering what it would be like this season.   Hopefully I can get out and catch some of the action!  Cheers.

585545,Michael_Brown,2011-05-22 14:34:00,411,"Try a 3/8 ounce black bucktail jig around deep weed edges in 8-12 feet of water. You will also catch fish on crankbaits cast along the edges as well but the jig is usually a more consistent bait.   BJ Tackle in Bewdley has festival buttons, so if you catch a tagged prize fish you will win a great prize. Button purchase also enters you into the festival draws at the end of the event.  Good Luck."

585642,Hooked,2011-05-23 00:24:00,891,Great to hear!  Now I hope the bite is still incredible between July 23rd and August 6th!  No need to say where I'll be during that time!
