585324,Big Cliff,2011-05-21 01:10:00,6899,Got a nice little batch on Thursday and a nice bag of fiddleheads on Monday. Nature is so good to us!
585328,Fisherman,2011-05-21 01:29:00,7201,"Exactly what I had for a late supper, morels and fried eggs on toast. I also found another one you can eat, they grow on tree's. I've never seen them before, they're called Dryads Saddle or Pheasant Wings."

585363,Bassaholic,2011-05-21 13:41:00,74,I picked a grocery bag full on Wednesday and still saw lots of small ones that were about to pop up. Its a good year but far from our best.

585580,Fishnwire,2011-05-22 17:54:00,983,I can't seem to find any morels at my camp which is north of Sudbury.  I will admit I haven't looked too hard and don't even know where to concentrate my efforts.  There are a ton of fiddleheads though.  Last week when I was there I only found one little group of chutes that were very hairy and not ready.  When I go up on Tuesday there will probably be some.  I'm going to try them for the first time.  I heard I should just fry them in a pan with butter...is there anything else I should know or try?
585587,Vanselena,2011-05-22 19:19:00,269, Try sandy areas with elm or hickory trees
