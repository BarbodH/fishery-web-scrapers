468593,splashhopper,2010-05-22 00:41:00,2931,"The 12 ft tinnie I bought is 19-20"" deep..  I am thinking this would mean it will need a short shaft motor?   What is a reasonable price for a used 9.9 hp motor for this boat?  What brands should I stay AWAY from in these motors?  Thanks  Splashhopper"

Johnson, Evinrude, Mercury or Yamaha are all good. Price is dependent on age. You will be able to get a good used motor for between $500 and $1000. Good luck on your search."

There is a gent in beamsville that sells used outboards,his name is Hans,I dont have a #.But I bought an 1985 honda 7.5 4 stroke in mint shape for 800 bucks.His labour rate is excellent too."
