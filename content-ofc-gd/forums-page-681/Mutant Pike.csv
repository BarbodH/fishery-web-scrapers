468776,irishfield,2010-05-23 01:48:00,26272,Amazing what you can find when you fish beside a sewage outlet..
468777,Terry,2010-05-23 01:57:00,14456,that might explain the deformities and sores in the pike
468779,irishfield,2010-05-23 02:07:00,26272,The pike looks like it has a 1/2 ounce bell sinker stuck to it's noggin.

468808,Joey,2010-05-23 10:49:00,9122,"That is just weird Terry.  But, some nice pickerel there and a nice shot of the turkey vulture  Joey"
468819,Terry,2010-05-23 11:42:00,14456,"thanks the thing on it's head was filled with a liquid, really grossed me out  and I don't like turkey vultures circling over head...I have watched too many western movies....LOL"
468822,Roy,2010-05-23 11:46:00,13728," The trick is that you have to make yourself appear to be living, Terry.  By the way, nice shirt!"
468838,Terry,2010-05-23 12:42:00,14456," the older I get, the harder that is do ...LOL  and yes I still dress for success"
468841,Afraz,2010-05-23 12:58:00,250,"Nice catches, lol you were fishing beside a sweage outlet LMAO !"
468852,Guest gbfisher,2010-05-23 14:01:00,0,Ya could of just fixed it's head up with a little surgery and showed the play by play. That would of been great!
468860,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-23 14:41:00,3761,"Almost all the Pike we caught in Pickering had a gash or something taken out of their side...was weird, even a oos bass had a bite out of it. Do you think they pike bite eachother like this during the spawn?  Nice pictures Terry, definitely a weird looking pike lol"
