The strikes are much more often than two weeks ago, and the catches too.  This report is from last Friday, 6 hours fishing, 4 pikes and several breams, now they are also trying to shallow the slalom bait, guess they should put some butter on it just to avoid the lure from getting stuck in that little mouth.  The activity is still completely centered after the midday, the first strikes came after 11 a.m, and the last pike was fished after 3 p.m.      These to fellows were still prespawn, 90 and 75 cm.  The next one was over 60-65 cm but it scaped  from my hands before I could make the picture. I didnÂ´t have to wait that long until the last pike of the day came.    91cm Jack postspawn.  And of course, a load of breams.      "

468644,solopaddler,2010-05-22 10:42:00,8605,It's no wonder there's so many large pike with such an abundance of soft finned forage.  Well done!
468659,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-22 12:34:00,0,Some nice pike and decent sized breem. But you should consider taking out the hooks before you pose! If those suckers jump and you get stung it will definitely suck! I used to handle them like that until I got a hook stuck in me.  Good to see some posts from the eastern continent.

468848,Carp,2010-05-23 13:23:00,1488, Centimetre  Very respectable Pike. Good day on the water for you. Thanks for sharing.
