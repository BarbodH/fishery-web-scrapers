468794,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-23 04:17:00,10439,As promised I have got my top water pike video done. The video was shot several years ago in mid August on the Whitefish River that feeds into the Smith Arm of Great Bear Lake in the North West Territories. No giant pike unfortunately as they move out into the main lake in late July. Plenty of high flying action though on my custom made Cigar Tube topwater baits. So sit back and enjoy five minutes of fun!!!!  Topwater Pike Video
