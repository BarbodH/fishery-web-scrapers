I will be fishing for primarily PIKE and WALLEYE (Maybe CRAPPIE if they're up there too). Any tips anyone can offer? IE: What works best up there?  Any and all tips are appreciated... Feel free to PM me if you wish...  Thanks, A2F"

468861,Bob,2010-05-23 14:44:00,370,"A spinner or jig with a worm up river by the pilings will get you walleye.  Pike are all over the place, Boomcamp Bay, Vance's Bay, the bay by Brennan Harbour resort or the lagoon in back of the southwest tip of Green Island. I've always had good luck trolling Rapala type baits for pike. Troll fast! If you're fishing outside the mouth of the river, keep a sharp eye on conditions, that Whalesback Channel can go from flat calm to eight footers in next to no time.  Talk to Becky at the marina (Vance's), she'll tell you where folks are getting their fish."
