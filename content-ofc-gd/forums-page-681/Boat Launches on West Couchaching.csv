My May 2-4 just became a lot happier as my buddy has announced that his 20' Bayliner is ready to go for the weekend and that it will be making the trip to the cottage.  We're on West Couchaching, near the Menoke Beach Road area (8 minutes north of Orillia).  We are trying to figure out in advance where we're going to launch this boat as the cottage we are staying in is rented and I can't reach the landlord at the last minute.  So, I am seeking the OFC'ers assistance at the last minute.  Does anyone know of a boat launch in the general area?  Any help is greatly appreciated  Have a safe and happy weekend, Ryan"
