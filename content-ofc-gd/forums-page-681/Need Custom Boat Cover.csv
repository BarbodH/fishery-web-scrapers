468123,Lunkerhunter,2010-05-20 14:48:00,455,get some quotes cause when i needed one the prices varied greatly from company to company. also many different types of materials to choose from. some more expensive than others.
468251,Billy Bob,2010-05-21 00:22:00,5865,"Depending exactly how you are going to use your cover should dictate how much you should spend on material....I have a 25 year old canvas cover on my boat,however I don't use it that much...only now and then...if I was going to constantly use it when the boat was not in use (mine's in the garage when not in use) I would purchase the BEST material money can buy because the labor is about the same.  Hope this helps, Bob"
