Lots of flies but still good time by all...  Did an hour of trolling for lakers and got a huge one on....got away breaking my 20 Lbs fluoro leader and took my NK28 lure with it to the deep...oh well...second big laker I am missing trolling Simcoe this year.  Only got those two pictures on the BB, others have the rest on their cameras.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
