468914,yakpiker,2010-05-23 20:49:00,160,"I landed 3 pike today between 10:30 and 11:00.  2 of them were between 26 and 29 inches and fat.  Lost 2 more during that time and missed a half dozen others that followed and pecked.  Small spinners, especially silver (on a sunny day) were most effective.  Water temperature and cabbage seem ideal.  Lots of boat traffic in the afternoon didn't help.  Surface weeds are starting to fill in and will be a problem for casting and trolling with the sunny and hot forecast for the coming week.  "

468938,wankerjohn123,2010-05-23 23:19:00,117,  Near Hanlans Point? On the old docks?
468950,jediangler,2010-05-24 00:37:00,1923,Good job yakpiker. A small gaggle of yakfishermen from Yakfisher.net were heading to the islands from Cherry Beach today. Did you hook up with them?
468997,yakpiker,2010-05-24 03:35:00,160," Yep, they arrived early afternoon and I tried to orient them to the area in the rowing channel.  One of the guys hooked a 25+ pound carp on ultralight...took 25+ minutes to get it to the yak."
468998,yakpiker,2010-05-24 03:36:00,160, Past Hanlans Point in the rowing channel...the old docks are gone now.  I expect the pike will be heading that way during the coming week with the forecast.
