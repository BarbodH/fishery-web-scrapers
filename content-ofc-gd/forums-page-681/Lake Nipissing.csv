I'm an interested observer from S.Ont. who has been a member since 07 doesn't post very often (1) but likes to catch and read about fishing in Ont. I very much enjoy OFC for all the information you all provide. Everything from bug reports to how to catch fish. Keep up the good work. I have been reading with interest about water depths on Lake Nipissing this season. Has anyone from any level of government come up with a solution to the  problem  this year or are they hoping the Noah theory kicks in.(rain for forty days and forty nights)I.ve been going up to Nipissing with my family for sixteen years and I realize water levels have fluctuated between high and low but this year low water levels seem to be extreme from what I'm reading and being told by friends who have cottages up there. It could be costly for the tourism industry if people can't launch boats or even swim .It could also be a dangerous year and expensive with skags and props being damaged and motors flying through the air!I'd be interested to hear what the camp operaters on the lake have to say about the low water and any solutions they or any of the so called paid experts who govern over such things might have.Thanks for the time and space and I will continue to read with interest.
