Always followed the site, but never actually contributed so I thought I would start.  Hit the grand yesterday (York Area), and caught a bunch OOS bass and this pretty big Drummie which hit right on shore. It was also good to see a CO officer checking licenses which was a first for me in that area. One guy got a ticket for something but not sure for what."
