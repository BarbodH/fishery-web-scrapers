Surprisingly the water temps were up considerably....66- 68F   Most of the trout went to a plain old jig and minnow in 30' - 35'FOW  And once i found some walleye they wer between 50' and 60' FOW.  Seems like a theme so far this year both open water and on the ice as far as walleye go.....GO DEEP!   here's some video of yesterday afternoon   <object width=""480"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value="""

Every time I watch one of your videos, in the back of my mind I see you stopping for tea in the middle of a hot bite.  Has the topic of how you hold/ mount the video camera while you reel a fish in been discussed previously? I appreciate the time you take to film and post your reports."
468524,bigugli,2010-05-21 20:16:00,6138,Well done.
468661,limeyangler,2010-05-22 12:42:00,5204," Thanks KF, Yup...the camera holding thing has come up before......no fancy tricks....just manipulation of my digits despite their ever decreasing dexterity.....getting old you see.....lol.  here's the not so tripod camera style  "
468690,scugpg,2010-05-22 14:38:00,1373,Thats a good video thanks for posting. I'm getting into jigging by the boat and its interesting how much they hug the bottom like that.
468722,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-22 19:17:00,0,Great vid! It was really cool to see the fish come up and grab that lure on the Lowrance!
468844,limeyangler,2010-05-23 13:01:00,5204,"  Yup....had some big ones off the bottom too before.   Thats exactly why i like straight jigging, love X-Box fishing...lol. Its like ice fishing in summer!"
469003,MJL,2010-05-24 04:40:00,2427,"Awesome vid Simon  Looking at that fish finder footage brings back a flood of memories at how frustrating my ice season for lakers was...In my case, they rose up off the bottom but turned back down without hitting X 100"
