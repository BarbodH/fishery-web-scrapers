Maybe it'll be as funny this time around -  I became confused when I heard the word 'Service' used with these agencies:  Canada Revenue 'Service' Postal 'Service' Telephone 'Service' Cable TV 'Service' Civil 'Service' Government 'Service' Customer 'Service'  This is not what I thought 'Service' meant.  But today, I overheard two farmers talking, and one of them said he had hired a bull to 'Service' a few cows.  BAM!!! It all came into focus. Now I understand what all those agencies are doing to us.  Now you are as enlightened as I am.  JF"
