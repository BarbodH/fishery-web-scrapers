Seems that I am not doing too well with the pike this year.  Haven't seen many posts about pike other than SteveR's.  Are there less pike around these days?  On a side note, there are lots of smallies.  Don't mean to catch them but they are pretty agressive right now and I was fishing in places I didn't think they would be nesting in. Managed a 5 pound smb today.  Too bad it was oos.  Have to go back to those spots in July."
