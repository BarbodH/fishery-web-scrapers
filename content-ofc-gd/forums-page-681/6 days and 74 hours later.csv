Boy, work has gotten hecktic,but Im not going to complain,except all these hours are dragging me down.Be atch getting older.  I figured since TJ can work long and hard and have the odd great dinner,I thought I could too.  This is how you start a 3 day break. Wrapped scallops,lobster,shrimp and a kabob and vegies.    Would like to also thank Gerritt, for a generous invite for this weekend,but the work load forbidded me in attending.  Everyone play safe out on the water and make sure you have all your safety stuff.They aint playing around out there from what I seen on the news."
