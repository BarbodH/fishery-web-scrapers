468737,Kinger,2010-05-22 20:45:00,351,"a misnomer, spelled incorrectly. props."
468811,mbac31,2010-05-23 11:10:00,904,Whats a Pickerel?
468814,Roy,2010-05-23 11:36:00,13728," Kind of like an Atlantic except that it has a pointier snout, tougher scales, spiny rayed fins, different body colour, good sized,sharp, conical teeth, different habitat, is mainly a low light hunter, more prolific,....they both live underwater though so I guess they're close lookalikes."
468817,walleyemaster,2010-05-23 11:39:00,325," after reading that i feel ""hi"""
468821,solopaddler,2010-05-23 11:44:00,8605,"    That's all fine and dandy, but pickeral aren't being discussed.  Re-read the post title, we're talking pickreal here.  Pickreal are a little known subspecies of Walleye native only to a few very isolated pockets of ON.  Generally angled for by illiterate hayseeds."
