468903,newboykool,2010-05-23 20:02:00,81,is 7 to 12 good?
468909,yakpiker,2010-05-23 20:21:00,160,"Based on the last two weeks, I'd say mid-morning to mid-afternoon."
468913,Guest gbfisher,2010-05-23 20:42:00,0,Like all fish. The best time is when they are hungry.
468921,Roy,2010-05-23 21:20:00,13728,Pike hold banker's hours. Go after 10AM.
468923,Joey,2010-05-23 21:40:00,9122,We got ours today between 10 and noon!  They turned off after that.  Joey

468954,spinnerbaitking,2010-05-24 00:53:00,1622,Afternoon although I'll be going at 8am with a buddy & his wife she wants to beat the heat but I might be there til 6 or 8pm with my nephews Richard
468956,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-24 01:01:00,3761,"I got 2 fish today. One at 12:30, the other at 3:30...it's a toss up but I never got to fish earlier than 12:15 or no later than 4pm lol"
468991,Stoty,2010-05-24 02:43:00,2910,Depends on the body of water I guess. I've always had better luck in the morning.  Where are you fishing?
