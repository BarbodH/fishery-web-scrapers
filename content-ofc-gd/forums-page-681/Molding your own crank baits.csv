468064,Hooked,2010-05-20 04:16:00,891,"I have this crank bait that is no longer made and is very hard to find.  I was wondering if anyone here has any experience molding their own crack baits?  The good thing is I have a lure I want to replicate, so I have the design already, I just need to know how to replicate it? I was hoping for some personal experience on this, or information...  Thanks"
468089,Fish Farmer,2010-05-20 11:35:00,2234,"Do you have a picture of your lure? or name of the lure. My buddy buys Ugly Ducklings from ebay, that lure you just don't find in stores. I have a friend that is head of a antique lure club. I could ask him a few questions on your lure if you like.

468323,Hooked,2010-05-21 04:01:00,891,"Hey Fish Farmer, here is the pic of the lure, and thanks, I know it's Ukko, and the model is U-12 wobbler I believe, around 4.5"" long, colour doesn't matter:     Thanks Roy, that video was great, when things go right I'll post my successes, fingers crossed."
468570,Fish Farmer,2010-05-21 23:49:00,2234,"Hooker, I emailed my friend the antique lure collector. I'll post his info when he gets back to me. I've never heard of that make of lure, sure looks interesting, it looks a little like a Reef Runner lure. Be nice if we could get you on to some or a little info. "
468576,Fish Farmer,2010-05-22 00:00:00,2234,"Hooker I found this on Ebay, looks like he has a few http://cgi.ebay.ca/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=300352109424#ht_500wt_956  http://fishergears.com/products/Ukko,-lure.html"
468628,Hooked,2010-05-22 03:12:00,891,"  Please stop calling me a Hooker, haha.  Yeah, I seen those, unfortunately they are the larger ones, 16cm and 20cm.  I'm looking for the 12cm ones.  I did find some sites that appear to sell Ukko wobblers, but they are all in Germany, and quite expensive, around $23 CAN.  Thanks.  Funny, I purchased some reef runners, thinking they are close, just like your pic, but just not as good."
468655,Fish Farmer,2010-05-22 12:05:00,2234," I'm sorry Hooked, I got to get new glasses. I did see you were on other sites inquiring. I'll let you know what my buddy say's when he gets back to me. I see you live in Stoney Creek, I lived there most of my life on Margaret Ave.S. from 1954 Sorry again Hooked"
468791,Hooked,2010-05-23 03:40:00,891," No problem at all Fish Finder.  Yeah, I live pretty close to Margaret, I was actually very close to buying a house on that street."
