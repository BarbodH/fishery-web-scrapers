Just have a quick question about the Fifteen Mile Pond and Sixteen Mile Pond that are along the Qew on your way to Niagra from Hamilton. I got myself a 10' Basshound last summer with an electric motor on it and have only fished conservation areas. I was just wondering if im allowed to have the electric motor in those ponds and where can I find some shore line to drop the boat in the water?  Thanks in advance Bawbag

Only way to launch is to drag boat overland to water's edge. 16 Mile pond of the South service road has a shore access to a small lake. 100' carry from road to shore. 16 pond in CDP is pretty small for boating. 15 Mile creek off south service road is more of a bog than pond now. i5 Mile ponfd in the park is down by 2 1/2 ', making much of it non-navigable. You also have a steep uphill portage to get boat out."
