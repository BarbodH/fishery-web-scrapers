They are good ones, loop system is closed. Also want to know how much line I should add on away from the bouncer? 2-3ft? Use a jig with worm or worm harness or spinner bait. I'm fishing Nipissing south shore.  Appreciate any help...  Thanks!"
468877,dave524,2010-05-23 17:13:00,4508,"Used them a lot for trolling walleyes in the evening, used the Gapen BaitWalkers in various sizes depending on depth with a floating rapala or a worm harness 30 - 36 "" off the back. Google Gapen Bait Walker and there's chart showing recommended weights for various depths, these worked well for me."
