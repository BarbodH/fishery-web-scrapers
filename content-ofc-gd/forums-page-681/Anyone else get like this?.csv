468477,JohnF,2010-05-21 16:58:00,3494," I'm with you on that one. To this day I can easily do the entire trip to Florida in one pass, but my wife threatens me with bodily harm if I keep running past 6 or 7 in the evening. I detest the return trip. There was a time she'd put up with non-stoppers, but no longer. Mebbe that's why we fly everywhere now.  As for the nervous anticipation. There's a fine line between sheer excitement and serious jurassic park type butterflies. The night before a dive trip when I knew we'd be doing a new deep dive I was always wired. I wasn't comfortable till I was kicking for the bottom, then I was fine. With fishing I'm just antsy to get at it. I guess I know I never catch big toothy fish so there's no nerves involved. Mebbe one day I'll hook into a big musky and poop that proverbial brick, and then I'll get pre-fish jitters after that, but a 5# bass just doesn't frighten me.  JF"
468516,wankerjohn123,2010-05-21 19:39:00,117,"When I get like that... it drives my wife crazy!!! All I'm thinking/dreaming about is catching trophy fish and limit after limit of Walleye. Then my wife goes.. what's wrong? everything Ok? Ya everything is fine hun. She says... You sure? I say... Ya, Ya, Ya everything is OK. And it's always the week/weeks before the big week long trip up to the NIP.  She thinks I'm mad at her LOL!. And all it is, is me thinking what else I need to bring/buy/what spots am I gonna hit this year fishing.....      I just love fishing."
468529,Terry,2010-05-21 20:30:00,14456,every time
468568,irishfield,2010-05-21 23:39:00,26272,I think Terry only had a hard time sleeping the first time I stuck him in a room with Dano...
468569,vinnimon,2010-05-21 23:46:00,2593,"Every friday,sat and sunday night.Its always a last minute decision on where and what to go for.AHHHH the day trip adventures I go on.gotta love it.And tired as well looking for a new spot to go."
468602,walleyemaster,2010-05-22 01:08:00,325,im leaving next friday and i can't sleep..the night before i don't sleep im up 24 hours..its just nuts..
468603,vinnimon,2010-05-22 01:11:00,2593,IM LIKE THIS RIGHT NOW!!!!!ARGHHHH!!!!!!!
468672,Mike the Pike,2010-05-22 13:49:00,3421,Ah so that would explain why you go to bed early the following night Geritt.
468675,Drew_10,2010-05-22 13:55:00,111,"I get it bad.  I'm just glad I'm not the only one!  Won't be getting much sleep this weekend, too much fishing to do."
468911,yakpiker,2010-05-23 20:35:00,160,"Only 39 more days until our trip to Attawapiskat.  Based on the last fly-in trip to Edgar Lake, I'll need 14 hours of driving to Nakina and a handful of brews to get to sleep the night before.  Still get excited about fishing, just like when I was a little kid."
468294,Gerritt,2010-05-21 02:43:00,6129,"So I am heading up to Nipissing tomorrow in the early AM....  and it never fails! I get to worked up to sleep!  Little butterflies in the stomach, thinking about the big one..  Am I alone in this?  I feel as though I am on edge, and have this odd feeling about me..  jesus I get excited about fishing trips like these...   So tell me am I alone?   G"
468295,kickingfrog,2010-05-21 02:47:00,8333," I don't know, you tell me.  Oh and yes I do."
468296,muskymatt,2010-05-21 02:48:00,2608," Yup ,,,and not just the trips...  Everytime I find myself with boat in tow headed to my favorite muskie haunts the same thing happens..."
468298,danada,2010-05-21 02:50:00,31,"I am heading up to the south bay next weekend for a week of fishing with the guys, annual trip. I have the same problem as you except i have another 7 days to go."
468299,asdve23rveavwa,2010-05-21 02:50:00,2690,"Yup, the anticipation is part of the thrill!!!"
468303,HTHM,2010-05-21 03:01:00,4082,I seem to remember you saying something like this before.... Have a GREAT trip!
468336,splashhopper,2010-05-21 08:01:00,2931,  Nope... u are not alone....  I am not even leaving till sat am... and i am amped up now....waaay tooo early Friday am (4:00 am)
468338,fish_fishburn,2010-05-21 09:57:00,1311,"I had the same thing, but really bad.  I went to a specialist to see if he could help me. He gave me a perscription. A mickey of Wisers Deluxe the night before and a 60 to bring along just in case.  Have a good one."
468344,bigugli,2010-05-21 10:39:00,6138,I'm like that on every road trip. The journey is half the thrill. No problem driving for 22  hours straight through to Florida. Couldn't sleep if I wanted to.  The reverse side of the coin is the trip home. I could have a nap after the first hour behind the wheel.
468346,IndySKS,2010-05-21 10:53:00,134,"nope your not alone, it happens to me sometimes too. Although im leaving in a few minutes for north bay area too, i slept like a baby last night. I find it happens when i over think things, plan everything to death and let my mind wander thinking about what ever it is i am going to do. This time i have been too busy to think about it an really have nothing ready. It will all come together in the next hour and we will be on the road. have a great long weekend everyone."
468347,laszlo,2010-05-21 10:54:00,487,Falling asleep isn't too much of a problem. It's staying asleep for me. I'm good until about 3am and then it's just tossing and turning from that point on with visuals of what's to come consuming my mind.
468349,packrat,2010-05-21 11:00:00,93,  Exactly---
468350,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-05-21 11:01:00,1362, I'm the same as you Laszlo!!....I fall asleep quickly and then some internal alarm clock rings in my brain and I'm wide awake from 2:00AM onwards....  Have a great trip Gerritt!!
468362,robertag,2010-05-21 11:59:00,42, Ditto.  Leaving tomorrow morning.  Won't get much sleep tonight.
468387,Beans,2010-05-21 13:01:00,3339, Yup...even at my age (74)...  I get as excited as a teenager about to get .... for the first time !!!
468407,wankerjohn123,2010-05-21 13:43:00,117, I head up for a week every year to go fishing... I get hiped up a month before I go....   
468426,limeyangler,2010-05-21 14:58:00,5204,Its not just you....i feel like i did when i was 8 years old on xmas eve.....its fantastic!
468435,Swan_Dive,2010-05-21 15:17:00,46,"I get like that when Iam not even going fishing the next day.  Last summer I would wake up around 7am on a saturday and couldn't fall back asleep cause I knew there were fishing shows on!  Two nights ago I was wide awake at 4am thinking about fishing and thinking about how ""now would be a good time to get out there right as the sun is coming up"".  My wife says I have a problem and I probably do but I love it.  I love sitting on a river or on a boat and having the excitement of catching a fish.  Iam going fishing tomorrow morning with my dad and even though we are getting up first thing in the morning, Iam sure I won't be getting any sleep!!"
468442,discophish,2010-05-21 15:27:00,392,"Yeah, I get this all of the time.  But when I wake up, I turn the vibration mode off on the Lazyboy which causes the jitters, switch off WFN, and stumble to bed.  It really sucks when you realize that you have to work the next morning, and got all worked up for nothing."
468447,rock34,2010-05-21 15:37:00,215,"Man....I am so happy to hear that this is common.  I was thinking that I had a problem or something.  I mean, other then the obvious  I really thought it would go away but it never does.  I find it the worst with Steelheading because you have to pick your river and the desicion can be boom or bust.  Those nights are rough.  The other types of fishing arent that much better though.  Have a good weekend all!"
468450,NAW,2010-05-21 15:42:00,4022,Crazy what this sport does to people eh!  I could go into an MMA fight with out the slightest jitter.  But my hands start shaking when i'm locking the trailer to the hitch..
468451,cityfisher,2010-05-21 15:44:00,959," happened to me lastnight, i try to get to bed early.... 2am im still looking at the clock... o well should make my drive to the cottage this afternoon brutal"
468452,backbay,2010-05-21 15:45:00,773,"I can never sleep before a trip. Once I'm a way, I'm always up with the birds. I don't even know when I'm going north next, but I wish I could fast-forward and go fishing right now....."
468459,kickingfrog,2010-05-21 16:18:00,8333, Hopefully the fishing trip lasts longer.
