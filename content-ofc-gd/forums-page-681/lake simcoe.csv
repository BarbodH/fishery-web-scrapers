468812,walleyemaster,2010-05-23 11:26:00,325,here is a trout caught in tough weather conditions..the bite was on for about 2 hours.. kept 1 and put 6 back.. all of them close to this size..we ate this one and he was just fine.. wish i could stay out longer but the wind was too strong boat would not hold
468816,Terry,2010-05-23 11:38:00,14456,"nice going, hope to get out there soon for a few of them"
468818,Roy,2010-05-23 11:40:00,13728,"Very nice, were they deeper than usual?"
468826,walleyemaster,2010-05-23 11:50:00,325,most caught were in 75-85 feet but then again.. this guy we caught in 65 so who the hell knows..this is the first time we caught 6 trout in one day all in 2 hours of fishing..i think it was one of those days when the fish were  on the hunt..
