467116,Billy Bob,2010-05-17 11:36:00,5865,"My starting battery is 9 years old and it's a dual purpose Delco Voyager group 24....however, this year it's starting to show it's weakening as per my on-board constant battery monitor...but I think it will get me through this year.  The big thing is my batteries are charged and maintained 24/7/365 on my on-board battery charger when not fishing by this charger.  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/templates/product/standard-item.jsp?_DARGS=/cabelas/en/common/catalog/item-link.jsp_A&_DAV=MainCatcat21276-cat600056_TGP&id=0043939018868a&navCount=2&podId=0043939&parentId=cat600056&masterpathid=&navAction=push&catalogCode=IA&rid=&parentType=index&indexId=cat600056&hasJS=true"
467129,Thrasher,2010-05-17 12:26:00,39,"I had a trojan, lasted 5 years, amazing battery, but $$$. Didn't want to spend the $$$ on a gel cell, so went to Total Battery, bought their brand, and they are awesome. I use it in a 16.5 lund, with a 46lb thrust bow mount. I use it for trolling, i ran it for 6 hours almost straight, and used about 1/2 the charge. My brother runs a 21' nitro bass boat, and uses 2 of them in his 24v system, and never an issue during tournaments etc. Best bang for your buck IMO. I also used this additive for them, Supposed to increase battery life, increase charge time, and decrease discharge time. I'm by no means an expert with battery stuff, but mines working great!! As said, go with a min group size 29, preferably 31."

468647,ohhenrygsr,2010-05-22 10:55:00,947,Just a heads up I was in the auto dept at Wally world and they had energizer 27 series for $107 and I believe starting batteries where $87
468652,scugpg,2010-05-22 11:52:00,1373,I think a standard Group31 battery is around 72lbs....the Optima 31 is 59lbs.  Standard Group 34 should be around 53lbs vs the Optima D34M at 43lbs.  When comparing batteries be sure to compare apples to apples on battery size.  I won't hesitate to buy another optima battery....although the Oddesy AGM batteries sound good as well but are around the same price range. This is a very handy chart that Odessy has outlining estimate run times with a trolling motor  http://www.odysseybattery.com/trollruntimes.html
468653,mbac31,2010-05-22 11:52:00,904,Come over to look at my setup bud. I have the 27 series from Interstate (Green Top). These are the best I have found so far. Also I found that mount you were looking for. I just found it for you. I also have the 1000 CCA from Interstate ordered now again. I use them a ton with a MInnkota 101 and can go a long time on one charge. I usually go 2 days if needed. Call me to set up a time for you to grab that mount
468666,Toddyc20,2010-05-22 13:15:00,141, Do you have the SRM-27 or the SRM-27B?  My brother and I just picked up two SRM-27B's this winter and installed them into the boat.  We replaced a single SRM-27 (which still worked fine we just wanted longer life) and I had the boat out the other day with the two batteries and it was outstanding.  Had that trolling motor running almost all day long (6-8hrs) and it never dropped in power at all.  This will come in handy when we are up north where we don't have access to power for recharging and when it is very windy.  Overall though we are very happy with all the interstate batteries we've had.
468680,Sinker,2010-05-22 14:11:00,8692,"They all work well if you maintain them.  I've tried them all. Right now I'm using two walleye-1 batteries, and they're awesome.  If my bowmount is in the water, I'm pretty much always slow trolling for walleye. The motor is going constant. I get about 7 hours of trolling, at at least half power on a 55lb minnkota PD, from one battery. If I hook them both together, I get more than double that. Even on a windy day. If I""m just using the bowmount for positioning the boat, I can go a full weekend, no problem off two batts.....and then some.  S."
468703,lifeisfun,2010-05-22 16:07:00,99,The ultimate battery if you can afford it would be probably Odyssey: http://www.odysseybattery.com/marinespecs.html
468789,mbac31,2010-05-23 03:29:00,904,I have the 27b's. Great batteries. I run them hard and alot. They take a beating. I have blown 3 Optimas so far. They never lasted like these. Another great battery is the Natualius from Crappy Tire. They work just as good. The Odyssey batteries are $500 a pop. That would cost me 0ver $3000 just for batteries. I looked at them but so far I will stick with these. Lol. I find that the harder you run these the better they work. If you maintain any battery the proper way they will last for years. One quick note is that you should charge them as soon as possible and not let them sit to long drained like alot of people do.
468853,Toddyc20,2010-05-23 14:06:00,141,Glad to hear you really like your 27B's.  I did a lot of research and I found the 27B to be the best bang for your buck.  For only $10 more than the 27 the gains are much better.
468854,lifeisfun,2010-05-23 14:07:00,99,"You clearly didn't read Odyssey specs., warranty and lifetime expectancy"
468875,mbac31,2010-05-23 17:10:00,904,"I read and have seen them in action. But at the price they are charging thats a little steep even for me. I dont think they are going to last the full time they state. If they do, awesome. I wont even keep a boat that long.   Not going to give them batteries if I sell my boat so need to but others to take their place. They are usually installed on bigger Cabin Cruiser style boats anyways"

I am looking for a couple batteries that are known to take a good long day (or two) without a charge  Which batteries would you suggest which last a long time?  my energizer's last me a good solid day and sometimes a half day ontop of that...if i were able to get a quality battery that would give me just that little extra boost would be great  any experience with Deka or OPTIMA???????????????????????? WHere's the best price to purchase some if these bad boys?  thank you!  -Mark"
466807,EC1,2010-05-15 20:53:00,930,"I have an interstate deep cycle that I've been happy with, although Im running a 32lb thrust on a canoe. It can easily last me a day, but obviously not to the use that you guys do in a boat.  I think you honestly cannot go wrong with the Optima batteries (6 pack looking ones), although I believe they are quite pricey"
466831,denisk,2010-05-15 22:48:00,163,Check out Optima
466840,SlowPoke,2010-05-15 23:23:00,2984,"I have 3 Optima's. I would recommend them in a heartbeat but they're damn expensive. I went with the Optima initially while sorting out an overcharging issue that exploded my starting battery. The Optima worked well even while being overcharged. It never got warm and didn't spew like a typical battery since it's sealed. I've since rectified the situation by removing, of all things, the 'rectifier' and replaced it with a later model regulator. I subsequently purchased two more Optima's for my trolling motor. No troubles with the Energizer in may last vehicle (Tahoe) and I've replaced an ""Eliminator"" from CTC under warranty in my wife's van. I don't think I would buy another one of those.  "
466842,Billy Bob,2010-05-15 23:29:00,5865,"IMHO the Optimas are WAY over price and OVER rated...  You don't say where you're from but if you're near Fort Erie, Ontario then hop over to our side with boat in tow...go to Sam's Club and get the batteries you need...I believe each will cost you about $65 -$69 each and they are GREAT BATTERIES...."
466863,Ron,2010-05-16 01:29:00,1683,"Optima Blue tops, best battery you'll ever own. Half the weight (well not half but you get the picture). I am running a 70lb 24 volt Minn Kota and get 2 days easily out of them. Trolling motor ran at 30% on constant today, went to check the battery level and still shows 90%. Good for another day with out charging.  I got mine at Wallmart one day when Energizer had a display booth set up and they gave me a smoking good deal. Both batteries for under 250.00"
466866,Dutch,2010-05-16 01:45:00,831,"For the deep cycles, go with 31 series, not 27 or 29.  You will never have a problem with running out of juice.  I am using some generic brand from my local battery shop and have been for 3 seasons now - still like new.  Keep them charged, keep the terminals clean and you will be fine."
466869,SlowPoke,2010-05-16 01:57:00,2984, Pretty close. I think 3 Optima's weigh the same as 2 conventional deep cycles. That's a big difference for the guys running the 100 lb thrust motors up front.

466896,ld17,2010-05-16 03:04:00,319,I have been running a optima (blue) battery for about 4yrs with no issues. Lots of juice at the end of the day running all day long.  I did get a great deal at walmart. I don't remember the price but it was a really good deal.  One of the claims it makes is that it can withstand vibration.  I don't know if this is true or not but if you think of the trailering over bumps and pounding waves it must have an affect on batteries.  You get what you pay for.  I would recommend this battery.

466933,scugpg,2010-05-16 11:53:00,1373," I have 2 of the small Bluetops on a 24V (and powering all my boat electronics off 1 of the batteries) and it lasts a very long time. I could go 2 days easy on mine Check Costco and Wallmart for prices, I think costco is the best price. Also check their site for rebates.  Its extremely important you use a quality charger with Optimas though, I highly recommend the CTEK US3300 its one of the few chargers Optima recommends for their batteries http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/4/Auto/BatteryChargersAccessories/BatteryChargers/PRDOVR~0111522P/CTEK%252BMulti-use%252B3300%252B3.3A%252BBattery%252BCharger.jsp  PS I think we really need a sticky on the battery subject"
466937,Gerry,2010-05-16 12:45:00,257,"I'm with Dutch, the 31 series offers the most amp hours and this what you want for trolling motor applications. Trojan, IMO, are the best but they are heavy. Also, the link about battery info is a good read to properly understand how the various types of batteries work.  Battery Info  Trojan Batteries"
466942,lew,2010-05-16 13:37:00,12766,"My last boat came with a Walleye 1 for the cranker and a pair of OMC batteries for the deep cycles and all 3 were excellent batteries that never failed in 8 years of hard use but I changed them up just in case.  My new boat also has a Walleye 1 for cranking and the 24 volt bowmount uses a pair of batteries called ""Deep Cycle Marine & RV batteries made by Crown Batteries in Ohio. Never heard of that brand but after 1 season they still work but I spose time will tell  IMO, the  secret to long battery life is to charge them completely after EVERY trip with a quality charger and keep them full of water.  And for what it's worth, in my many many years of owning batteries, I have NEVER used anything other than good old tap water to top them off and my batteries always last a long time."
466956,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-16 14:54:00,3761,"Good to hear about those Energizer's. I'm buying a Marine Energizer in a few weeks to go with my other Marine Battery. Will be running my Minn Kota Trandsom 30lb and a small bilge pump in my portable livewell all day usually. That with a Solar Panel will be perfect, having a spare is nice to have also (aka my Marine from last season). Was out with Gone Fishn 2 weeks ago and he has I think it's a 45lb Minn Kota with a 52"" shaft on the front of his 14'. We ran that motor all day in the sun and that Panel kept the battery at a high charge all day long with a 30min break letting it charge some more.

467016,Fisherman,2010-05-16 23:10:00,7201,"For those that have a great raging hard fishing rod for the Optimas, you should really go and check numbers, ie the useful time period(amount of amps in the battery) compared to others of the same size(Group number) and then see the difference in price.
