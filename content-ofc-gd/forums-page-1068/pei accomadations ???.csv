It is very quiet and beautiful there and you can walk out on the sand flats during low tide and find sand dollars. Singing sands beach is a little more then an hour away, it's a beautiful beach...probably the nicest beach on the island. This isn't the place if you want to be in the main tourist location and tourist beach."
