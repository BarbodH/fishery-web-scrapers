172320,danbouck,2008-03-16 23:15:00,4380,A couple months ago I got a great deal on an older 6Hp Johnson for the Tinny. So today I decided since it was so nice out to get it running and tune it up. Well I got everything all set up and the damn thing started first pull  Now what am I gonna do for the rest of the night? The thing ran mint. I love those old Johnsons.  (Now I really can't wait until the ice is gone)
172326,Bernie,2008-03-16 23:34:00,3190,Those are terrific little engines Dan.
172329,pikehunter,2008-03-16 23:41:00,1659," LOL, I love my old ""Johnson"" too!  But I kind of like my newer Johnson on the back end of my boat too."
172418,2 tone z71,2008-03-17 03:10:00,1311,"how old is old ,what did ya have to set up points etc I got a nice 98 9.9 givin to me last fall was a great gift and is gonna make a great kicker"
172425,crappieperchhunter,2008-03-17 03:41:00,2582,My Johnson will be 45 this summer. The cowling has faded just a little but that son of a gun just won't die !!!
172442,boatman,2008-03-17 10:33:00,350,"""damn thing started first pull ""  That's how those old Johnson/Evinrudes should run. Good score. Those are great motors."
172450,lew,2008-03-17 11:24:00,12767,"Everyone in my family owned Johnsons all the way back into the 50's and I don't recall anyone ever having a bad one....... sorta like an old Chevy, they just never quit"
172483,muskymike,2008-03-17 13:25:00,772,"I sold my 80' 20HP Johnson and now run a 93' 15HP. I miss the old one though. The 20HP seemed to run as fast as the 30HP they are putting out today. Either way, i have had no problems with either, other then my 93' snapping the throttle cable, due to a mechanic that had no idea how to reassemble after cleaning the carb"
172486,danbouck,2008-03-17 13:36:00,4380,  It is a late 70's one. I wasn't completely sure what I was in for. Figured maybe clean out the carb and put new plugs in.
172487,TJQ,2008-03-17 13:36:00,7806,"I had a great old 8hp johnson, before idecided to run it with no mix.....  now i have a 6 inch johnson...  at least the old one donated its body parts to my buddy who has an identical motor.. whch is stll running... always sign the donor card."
172490,Terry,2008-03-17 13:53:00,14456,"ah..TJ  ok why are you telling us that you have a 6"" johnson  some info we just don't need to know"
172491,irishfield,2008-03-17 13:55:00,26272,Not sure if he's braggin or complainin... can never tell with TJ.
172495,TJQ,2008-03-17 14:20:00,7806,definitely braggin'  and thats a typo...   I meant 6 hp....
172508,Terry,2008-03-17 14:46:00,14456,well ok then.....LOL
172540,John,2008-03-17 15:56:00,2956, My Johnson is 55 on Saturday. Never missed a beat either.....
172545,ccmtcanada,2008-03-17 16:12:00,7971,You guys are still talking about your boat motors right?
172553,Hookset,2008-03-17 16:21:00,367,"  Ahem... pretty sure that there is what you call a ""Freudian Slip""  Let's just leave it at that   Hookset."
