171470,lenray,2008-03-14 20:48:00,18,I was wondering if any of you kind folk have taken this train trip?? If so would you share your thoughts concerning the trip. Would like to go in mid summer.

It takes quite a while, but I hear its not a bad way to go.  Mid-summer you will see Beluga Whales by the thousands in the river and lots of birds. You might even see some polar bears. Churchill is a beautiful spot with a few good restaurants."

172314,lenray,2008-03-16 23:02:00,18,I like to ride the train and see different wild country.  Thinking the train leaves Thompson at night so that would not be the best for me. Any info. on the trip up to Mooseenee --sp.-- how far??  any restaurants up there???   Motels for the night?? how long of a ride etc.   Thanks for the info.
