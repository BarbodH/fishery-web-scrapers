So I did some reading, had some free time and decided to hit the reservoir down the road from my place.  I also managed to meet some well known OFC'ers BBR, Sugarpacket and SledEd!    I knew of a weed flat that I fished in the summer, so I poped my first hole near the edge, dropped my jig down poped it up once or twice a wham - first perch of the day - and first one through the ice for me!    Managed three more in the next 15 minutes, missed a few and then they shut down.  All we managed the rest of the day was OOS Largies, and a whack of gobies - BBR was the gobie master of the day!      Didn't get any group photoz as we were to busy getting our butts whopped by the fish!  thanks for meeting up guys, we'll have to get onto some better fishing this summer.  Cheers, UF"

My uncle had a cottage on the main lake and I spent my weekends there as a yougn'  Fished smallies in the boat docks, pike in the back bays, and lakers out in the deep water.  It's a Deep cold lake. Many fond memories there man!  My biggest fish for years was an ugly old ling that I caught ice fishing a good solid 15 years ago.  Cheers, UF"
