172692,Cory,2008-03-17 21:13:00,170,yes they do.
172726,Stoty,2008-03-17 22:50:00,2910," Future Shop.   I am aware it was a clearance sale. And like I have said a few times before, I did call ahead and check the online stock at multiple stores. Even though I called, and checked online, they didnt have any stock when I got to the store. And I was there the Friday night (after the prices are in effect, and before the sale starts) Why advertise that you have augers on sale, when you dont have any in stock???"
172729,irishfield,2008-03-17 22:54:00,26272, Now there's a place I refuse to spend a dime... and besides they don't sell fishing equipment !
172672,irishfield,2008-03-17 20:21:00,26272,"Yes it's a clearance sale to make room in the warehouses. Note that even Frabill Corp does not have stock on the 2 man shelter. CTC just wants them out of the way... could even be a discontinuted model.. who knows with Frabill now having their GT models at 30%+ more retail $ than the model offered for sale. CTC is what it is and what it always will be and when you're getting something 50% off retail a bit of computer/phone and foot work is worth it IMHO. I'm amazed that they even have on-line stock checking and from what I've seen so far it was pretty darn acurate on Friday before the sale. We all complain about Crappy Tire... but who else has inventory checking on line. You won't find it at Bass Pro, Walmart or elsewhere I know of.  I posted the link to the clearance items. Easy enough to click on it.. browse the products offered and get the product code. Call or walk in the store with the print out and say I want this! I was the same as Captain Bruce.. they brought me out the power auger on a hand cart and said ""here"". I could have left with the cart...."
172685,Cory,2008-03-17 20:47:00,170,  LCBO
172687,irishfield,2008-03-17 20:51:00,26272,Do they ever run out Cory?
170727,Fisherman,2008-03-13 02:53:00,7201,"Just got next weeks CTC flyer, there's a 1/2 price sale on some ice fishing equipment, including some huts, augers, rods & reels, etc."
170736,irishfield,2008-03-13 03:12:00,26272,haveda have a peak... is that 1/2 off power augers or hand augers?
170822,Fisherman,2008-03-13 13:07:00,7201,"They are showing a gas auger in the picture, I can only assume it includes them..."
170837,Stoty,2008-03-13 13:36:00,2910,"When does that sale start? I am on their website, but I can only seem to find the current flyer."
170838,bbog,2008-03-13 13:40:00,665,Sales at CTC usually run from Friday to the following Saturday and are posted online Friday morning.
170839,Stoty,2008-03-13 13:41:00,2910,"Oh, right on. Thanks! Looks like I am calling in sick tomorrow then! I need some ice fishing supplies for next year!"
170872,irishfield,2008-03-13 14:24:00,26272, Thanks!
170903,Fisherman,2008-03-13 15:22:00,7201," Just looked at the flyer again, don't be rushin' out there tomorrow, it says, sale starts March 15-21"
170906,ccmtcanada,2008-03-13 15:33:00,7971,"I work in Advertising for CTC.....  Sale start dates vary across the country.  It all depends on local newspaper distribution for the flyer as well as what the ""norm"" is for your area.  For instance, if a market has only a Sunday weekly local newspaper, then the sales will normally start on Sunday.  Most of Canada starts the sale on Saturdays....however, MOST stores will have the sale set up and the sale prices active on Friday evening."
170909,Stoty,2008-03-13 15:45:00,2910,"Is Pickering in the ""Start on Friday"" category?"
170922,bbog,2008-03-13 16:17:00,665,"Rylander store - Yes, Brock store - Maybe (take the flyer with you)"
170924,Stoty,2008-03-13 16:21:00,2910,Thanks Barnie.
170938,Fisherman,2008-03-13 16:56:00,7201,"Well dang, learn something new every day, Thanks for the insight."
170941,ketchenany,2008-03-13 17:23:00,3229,I knew that last Monday! but I couldn't say anything   There are other great buys too grass trimmer and stainless steel lights for the lawn at very good prices.
171062,Stoty,2008-03-13 22:11:00,2910,"Just called the Brock Road store in Pickering, and the guy wasnt very helpful. Said he had no idea whats going on sale, but the flyer for that store starts Saturday morning. I guess I wont be ""late for work"" tomorrow afterall. Darn!"
171371,bbog,2008-03-14 15:40:00,665,"I didn't want to say as much but the Brock store is rarely helpful - I avoid it as much as possible.  The details are now on-line. Those looking for a power auger will be delighted to find the Jiffy model on for $263 (78-8328-0). Trick will be to find one in stock somewhere. A couple manual augers, one ice fishing rod and lots of Plano bags - among other items.  Good luck to those hunting for a specific item."
171373,Stoty,2008-03-14 15:43:00,2910,"I called again today, hoping to get a different person, which I did, and he was more than helpful. He said the Brock Road store doesnt have any huts on sale, so if you were planning to go there Saturday morning to get one, dont waste your time."
171377,irishfield,2008-03-14 15:58:00,26272,Auger shows in stock in Midland/Barrie/Orilla and Wasaga Beach as of the 13th.  Toronto stores mostly look like special order... but the Albion Road store shows stock.  Has anybody used this 49cc auger??? The 85cc ones are not on sale.
171378,bbog,2008-03-14 15:58:00,665,Seems the only hut on for 1/2 price right now is the Frabill Trekker 2-Man (78-8092-8) $250. http://www.canadiantire.ca/browse/product_...fromSearch=true You'd have to check to see who has one in stock.
171380,Headhunter,2008-03-14 16:01:00,5703,A good friend of moine works at the post office and he brings home the CTC flyer on the Monday of every week... 4 days before the sales hit and a good 3 -4 days before they arrive in your mail box. Pretty much up on CTC sales every week! HH
171405,irishfield,2008-03-14 17:05:00,26272,WELL... if you want a power auger... get out of your chair and off to CTC. Sale may start tomorrow... flyer may not be up in the store and the item may be hidden in the back warehouse.... but the cash register is already programmed for the sale!  Don't bother with the Midland store... they had one and it now resides in my work shop!
171458,ketchenany,2008-03-14 19:55:00,3229,You are one quick dude Irish . . .
171460,irishfield,2008-03-14 20:00:00,26272,"I just know the Midland store never has anything once it goes on sale, so thought I'd be pro-active this time. Guess the other side of the coin is you can buy anything presale and bring it back the next day anyhow on the price guarantee for credit.  Sucker even started 2nd pull ! Unheard of from what I've seen this winter on most Jiffy's from CTC.  I have a pretty darn good inside source, with CTC, if I need it as well..."
171461,steelhedrmatt,2008-03-14 20:00:00,278,"Warden/eglington store had two, well, one left. that was 45 mins ago. I just bought one as well.  Their computer also says that there's one at whitby store"
171466,ketchenany,2008-03-14 20:27:00,3229,Checked my connection in Bownanville and he's them. I'm trying for numbers.
