172349,Nanook,2008-03-17 00:24:00,565,"  When I try to get into ""Chat"", I frequently get a message 'Error connecting to Chat, please try again later'. and wont let me in that day. I try again next day, not doing anything different, and I get in.  Any explanation, anybody. Its bad enough on Dialup, without these frustrations.  Thanks in advance."
172354,Mike the Pike,2008-03-17 00:30:00,3421, It may be because you are on dial up Jack .Did you download the Java so you can use chat?
172358,maybe,2008-03-17 00:38:00,307,"Is there a server & channel name that would make the chat work in a standard IRC program?  Avoiding java saves me a lot of headaches, if it's possible."
172392,Beans,2008-03-17 01:52:00,3339,"You might try re:booting your PC Jack...I know it is a pain with dial-up but sometimes that works...or maybe even just clearing your cache (cookies, history and temp files) via ""tools"" does the trick..."
