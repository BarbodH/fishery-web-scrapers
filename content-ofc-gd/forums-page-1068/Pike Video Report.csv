172210,iceguy,2008-03-16 18:33:00,341,"Thanks for all the great feedback everyone. It's almost been a year since I was given the camera for my birthday(from my wonderful wife) so I was thinking of putting a little video of the best fish We've caught(all the good fishing guys who have fished with me in the last year). This week some walleye,pike and perch. Want to go tuesday? The silverado sheriff probably would like to catch pike/walleye rather than perch.  We can take my vechicle. Let me know"
