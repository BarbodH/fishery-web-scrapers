Coverage Im curious about are: Liabilities/all parties Trailering/Launching/boarding Accidents/Sinking Motor overboard Theft/Damage/Fire/Explosion.....to Boat/Motor/Accessories. Trailer malfunction while towing.  Secondly, Is it best to: Insure through your homeownership policy. Auto insurance....(its different) or....separate alltogether.  We currently have CAA (gold+) and will upgrade to include boat/trailer as a side protection. I know theres a great resource of information here at OFC and your opinions and experiences in this are welcomed. Thanks, bNb"
172502,POLLIWOGG,2008-03-17 14:33:00,835,If I was to insure the boat I think I would want it on a separate policy so that any claim would not reflect on house insurance. Most people are scared to make a claim and are paying for insurance they won't use.  If you are a member of Canadian Power Squadron there is a policy available to you that you might want to check out.

172648,brickNblock,2008-03-17 19:45:00,598,"thanks for your replies fellas.. Im getting the idea that insurance..'APART' from the other insurances is the way to go from what Ive read thus far. I didnt realize that there are marine'ONLY' insurances.... I'll get in touch with judst that.... Thanks again for your valued input, bNb"
