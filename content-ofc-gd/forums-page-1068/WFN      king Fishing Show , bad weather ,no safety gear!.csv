I watched these guys ""Team Hard Way"" and team ""Salty Dog"" etc. They were using riggers and the weather got real rough, waves 3 to 4 feet rolling in . These guys were on deck with fair size boats, one with a hook, one with the rod and another    running the boat. I noticed that not one guy had a life jacket on. The one guy states he doesn't like standing at the bow of the boat while lightning is striking all while with a rod in his hand. He had a fish on. Are most fisherman this stupid,no life jackets,standing at the sides of an open boat,the waves 3 to 4 feet, high winds,lightning flashing with a rod high in the air. You wonder why the kids aren't taking heed to safety regulations and plain old common sense, watch this show and you will know why."
