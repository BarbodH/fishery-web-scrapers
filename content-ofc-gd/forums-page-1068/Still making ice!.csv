172506,bucktail,2008-03-17 14:44:00,1857,How depressing.... looking at the Environment Canada website on Great Lake ice coverage. In the last few weeks when we are supposed to be slowly loosing ice we gained more then at any other time in the year! Without a very significant warm up ( which isn't forecasted) it looks like ice out will be at least 3 weeks later then normal. Hey I am just the messenger!   Check it out.
