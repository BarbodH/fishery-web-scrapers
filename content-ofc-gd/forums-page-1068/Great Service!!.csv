172482,Gerritt,2008-03-17 13:24:00,6129,Just wanted to pass this site... Amazing Prices and fairly quick shipping... The shipping is dirt cheap too! 2-5 dollars. There was no problems with customs etc when we ordered some Stradic FI's @ 129.00!!!!    Anyways just thought I would pass this along to all you bargain hunters!  http://www.all-americanoutdoors.com/   Gerritt.

172523,Hooked,2008-03-17 15:11:00,891,"How much did it cost after shipping, duty and gst?  I checked the site and it stated for reels its around $14-$24."
172531,Gerritt,2008-03-17 15:32:00,6129,I ordered a Stradic FI and shipping to hamilton via USPS was 5.00  I paid no duty. Infact when I talked to them they say they almost never have a problem with customs.  G
172538,BillM,2008-03-17 15:48:00,17367,They most likely ship USPS Expedited..  I never get dinged for brokerage (Except for the $5 CanadaPost fee) if it's shipped Expedited..
172554,Hooked,2008-03-17 16:27:00,891,"Sweet, thx.  They have a sale on a spinning reel I've been looking at too, from $150 now $111."
