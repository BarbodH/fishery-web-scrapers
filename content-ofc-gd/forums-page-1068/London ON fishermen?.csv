172062,splashhopper,2008-03-16 10:56:00,2931,"Hey all u Londoners, or former Londoners:  Is there any interest in getting together and going fishing for a day some where for some Rainbows?"
172064,jwoolley,2008-03-16 11:02:00,25,Hook me up
172068,SlowPoke,2008-03-16 11:28:00,2984,I'm itching for some boat fishing on the Niagara but my boat is hibernating until mid-april. I'm not very well equipped for river fishing.  Can't wait for more of these Lake O bows!  -Brian 
172069,splashhopper,2008-03-16 11:34:00,2931,I am getting in touch with a few guys up in Goderich to see if the river has blown yet. ( not likely though)  We are looking to van pool and go the St Catherines / Niagara river next weekend for some shore fishing if anybody knows of some walk in entry points.  splashhopper
172159,jjcanoe,2008-03-16 15:56:00,744,Queenston would be the best bet for shore fishing but if the river is blown check out Port Dalhousie or Jordan Harbour  jjcanoe
172178,splashhopper,2008-03-16 16:52:00,2931,Thanks JJ. Do u want to come along and be our guide too and show us where to get in to the river areas that you think might be best suited for shore fishing?
172199,jwoolley,2008-03-16 17:59:00,25,"I know the entry point at Queenston, I also know of a place further up the river if you want to do a little trecking."
172201,splashhopper,2008-03-16 18:03:00,2931,that's great troll... I hope we catch a few too.
172264,jjcanoe,2008-03-16 20:59:00,744,I'd love to but I've been working nothing but 60+ hr weeks lately and I'm not sure if I could manage another day away before I go on holidays. I went to the sportsmans show on Saturday in Toronto.  I've got to recuperate before then.  Slowpoke is itching to get out.  Mid-late May and I'll be in action again.  jjcanoe
172288,splashhopper,2008-03-16 22:00:00,2931,NP   JJ.... we will have another one of these and leave a few fish for you for that one!
