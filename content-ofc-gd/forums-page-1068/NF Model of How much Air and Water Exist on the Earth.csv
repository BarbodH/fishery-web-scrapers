172088,Guest lundboy,2008-03-16 12:55:00,0,"http://blog.phiffer.org/post/27344630  Just a blog post, but someone had to do the math.... Everything below is just a cut and paste from he website above, the commentary is not Lundboys!    Left: All the water in the world (1.4087 billion cubic kilometres of it) including sea water, ice, lakes, rivers, ground water, clouds, etc. Right: All the air in the atmosphere (5140 trillion tonnes of it) gathered into a ball at sea-level density. Shown on the same scale as the Earth.  Update: this image has received a lot of attention and several people have emailed me asking whether I created it. Both the text and image were found on an internet message board, so Iâ€™m not sure who made it or whether itâ€™s accurate. A commenter at Boing Boing credits this to Adam Nieman and the Science Photo Library. Iâ€™ve replaced the image with a watermarked version after getting permission from the rights holder.  Andrew Nowicki writes:        Andrewâ€™s numbers are a good starting point, but Iâ€™m not sure they refute the imageâ€™s depiction or its caption. Iâ€™m currently traveling so I canâ€™t do the math right now, but I will make an attempt to verify this once I have a chance. If anyone else wants to take a shot, Iâ€™d be happy to post your results.  Update #2 Pat Stanton writes:                                                     Well done, thanks Pat!  Update #3 A representative from a company called Photo Researchers has contacted me and we had a phone conversation about my unauthorized use of the image. He works for the actual rights holder, represented by Science Photo Library, and said heâ€™d contact him to get his take on the situation.  The Boing Boing linkage changes the scale of things a bit and I think SPL would be savvy to find an official response that doesnâ€™t involve a take down notice. Iâ€™ll post more on this when I hear back, but for now here are the official sources in the US and UK.  Iâ€™m interested in how this experience relates to the theme Iâ€™ve been posting about. How does education happen in a networked context, as opposed to a textbook or television program (where SPL would normally license an image of this sort)? How can the two support each other? More on that later."
172090,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-16 13:03:00,1183,I think the formulas caused a major shut down in my brain.   So what does it all mean?
172093,Guest lundboy,2008-03-16 13:06:00,0,"don't have to figure out the formulas,  the picture shows the results of the formulas. little tiny blue ball equals all the water on earth compared to the size of the earth, the pink one is all the air compared to the size of the earth."
172128,Deano,2008-03-16 14:27:00,767,"That would make fishing easier, although the boat launches would be a zoo. LOL"
172130,ccmtcanada,2008-03-16 14:30:00,7971,"So, I have a better chance at catching fish in water than I do hunting birds, since there is less water than air?  Cool."
172134,keram,2008-03-16 14:48:00,585,"I like this kind of science  One question: Why they include everything, let's say 1 km below see level in his comparison (6,355.750 km earth radius) ?"
172143,Deano,2008-03-16 15:10:00,767,"If you like comparisons, here's a few more.  The Size Of Our World"
172234,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-16 19:58:00,1183, Well that can't be good...
172240,SlowPoke,2008-03-16 20:08:00,2984,We're still way better off than people on Mars
172308,shane,2008-03-16 22:52:00,652,  Hasn't this proportion of air/water/land always been this way?
172309,Guest lundboy,2008-03-16 22:55:00,0," As far as we know.  I don't think the picture is trying to say ""Thing's are getting bad and We're in Deep Doo Doo"",  it's just trying to illustrate the ratios."
172507,Casey123,2008-03-17 14:45:00,461,I have a head ache! 
172600,keram,2008-03-17 18:00:00,585,"Do not worry twilight. In reality it is 100 + (even more ) times better then it looks like. The picture ( very nice anyway) was to set your mind in the ""right direction"","
172657,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-17 19:59:00,1183, Whew...I was truly contemplating doing my part and taking a shower only once a week and a deep breath once every thirty seconds....
