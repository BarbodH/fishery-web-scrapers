I hope to fish more this softwater season and get the opportunity to post a few pics. I mostly fish Simcoe, Couch, Erie, and Rice Lakes, targeting perch, walleye, and bass. i love hunting as well as fishn and plan on a perch and turkey hunting weekend very soon! fried turkey and perch yum.  my current rig is a 02 crestliner cv182 and i'm looking for good price to find a spare trailer tire. BPS claimed to have a sale, but they were all small tires. Anybody know of a good place to find one/set of ST205/75D14 with galv rim? thanks in advance"
