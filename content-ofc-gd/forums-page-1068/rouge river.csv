172635,fishermccann,2008-03-17 19:15:00,655,"Was down at the mouth of the Rouge River on Sun. saw three  fisherpersons . Did not see them hook up , what were they fishing for  as they were pointed (fishing) out to the lake ,off shore and not along the river?"
172636,urbanangler1990,2008-03-17 19:18:00,933,"could be trout, maybe pike?"
172641,highdrifter,2008-03-17 19:28:00,2534,"If they were working long rods, prolly rainbows."
172660,gone_fishin,2008-03-17 20:01:00,481,"there are a lot of Steelhead (Rainbow trout) staged just outside the rivermouths right now, when the temperature is right and we get some rain, they will start moving up the river."
172686,fishermccann,2008-03-17 20:50:00,655,That must of been it as they were using fly rods out into the lake . Thanks for the help maybe I will give it a go after the next rain.

172805,fishing n autograph,2008-03-18 01:21:00,2540,"nope, milne dam isn't open.....but last summer i usually have my lunch in the parking lot off of Princess st x markham rd....just south of 7 and i'd watch people come and go w/ fly rods...they'd usually stop and share the pics on their cameras...."
