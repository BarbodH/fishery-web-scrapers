Despite semi-tough conditions and a light bite, it was once again a great outing: 15-20 walleye both in and out of the slot, bunch of perch (with a few real hogs), lots of herring and a bonus 28'' pike. Lost a big pike on one of the tipups and missed quite a few bites. Hot lure of the weekend was a tiny gold Williams with a minnow head, the Buckshot Spoon took a few as well as live minnows. Although not as hot as the action at the beginning of the season, it was still steady, and we had a few great laughs with Rob. We'll definitely be heading back for the opener next year. Tight lines and have a great softwater season, Darcy"
