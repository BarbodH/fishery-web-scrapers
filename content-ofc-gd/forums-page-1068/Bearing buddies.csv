172360,irishfield,2008-03-17 00:38:00,26272,They are worth much more! They keep a positive pressure on your bearing area...thus water stays out when backed into the lake.
172361,Terry,2008-03-17 00:40:00,14456,oh yeah...get them
172363,danc,2008-03-17 00:43:00,4677,They've not failed me in the past 15 to 20 years.
172364,Bernie,2008-03-17 00:43:00,3190,Yes- what Wayne said. Also when greasing don't pump grease into them once the plate reaches the outside contact point. I have seen where guys pump in too much and push out the seal at the other end. Great little device.

172416,Mike the Pike,2008-03-17 03:07:00,3421,Does someone have a pic of these BB.
172417,irishfield,2008-03-17 03:10:00,26272,"Remember my ""how too"" remove them post Mike? Spring loaded plunger grease fittings... to keep your hubs full of grease and void of water?  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...bearing+buddies"
172420,Mike the Pike,2008-03-17 03:17:00,3421,Thanks Wayne I will be putting them on my new boat trailer.  I blew a bearing and a Hub in November on my SSV trailer .  I just learned the hard way and will be maintaining my bearings from now on.  First will be the 4 wheels on my tent trailer this spring.  Thanks again .Mike
172424,Cookslav,2008-03-17 03:40:00,1457,Ya...need to pick up a new pair. Some    Swiped mine last year while I was out fishing at Stoney Lake. Couldn't beleive it. Not like they cost a fortune...
