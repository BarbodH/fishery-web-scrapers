Withing the hour thing got ugly . Parking lots were both full and every pool had atleast 2 guys in it..... I walked and dedicated some time to pools that have done well in the past but knew that the fishing pressure was making things tough  Finally scooped out a not so popular hole that I always neglect and noticed no tracks around it so I gave it a shot..4 drifts later PAM float went down and a scrappy male was darting around the pool man handling me...30 seconds later SNAP    soo mad cause i knew exactly Y !!! Yesterday I picked up some scientific angler 6lb tippet at the show that trout outfitters had on sale.....CLEARLY i know why it was on sale, stuff frays so easily I will never use it again....ticked off as I was , knowing it was the leader that failed me....I retied this time with the floro siglon that never lets me down. I was quite suprised that the fish hit my salmon bag. I had tied a few monster bags in the fall to fish with after a heavy rain so I brought them along as they were all I had left for roe...  Anyway 3 or 4 drifts later PAM the float goes down again and I'm running down this pool with another solid fish....I got its head up and saw  it was a female !!!!...A few quick darts and she was done. The siglon did the duty and I landed myself my first fat hen of 08 !!!      With my nerves leveling out from my first fish ,  I retied and started drifting the pool again....nothing for about half an hour and then, my float did a dead stop on the drift without going down. Thinking im held up on bottom I give her a light set and WAM the float takes off !!...At this point I am baffled this being my 3rd fish on loonie sized smelly as hell, salmon roe bags !!...This smaller female fought better taking a few more runs than the last, before I beached her for a quick pick.....   After getting her to the bank, I knew I had enough roe from the first fish to last me for the season so I layed her back in the pool to swim another day....I fished another half hour or so , and by this time it was 1:00 so I called it a day... Great first day to say the least, can't wait till Friday !!  Thanks Cliff, Scott , and Dave M for the tips the past few days.....all your info helped put together a productive first day !!  AHHHHHHH the treasure later that evening ,before the cure !! "
