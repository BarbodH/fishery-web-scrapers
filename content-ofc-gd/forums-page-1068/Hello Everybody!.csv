171646,tibbs,2008-03-15 03:59:00,650,"Hello, I've been surfing OFC for a long time now and thought it was time to join. I think this is an absolutely great community here. I've gotten a huge amount of fishing advice from just reading the posts. I fish for mostly bass at my uncle's cottage and occasionnaly lake trout. I know how much everyone likes pictures here so i'll post a few pictures from my greatest fishing adventure so far mind you that this is a couple years old,  <a href=""http://s268.photobucket.com/albums/jj25/tibbs937/?action=view¤t=131_3156.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i268.photobucket.com/albums/jj25/tibbs937/131_3156.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  I went to vancouver for two weeks and went Sturgeon fishing on the Fraser River. This is my first fish of the day.   <a href=""http://s268.photobucket.com/albums/jj25/tibbs937/?action=view¤t=131_3195.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i268.photobucket.com/albums/jj25/tibbs937/131_3195.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  This was the biggest fish of the day caught by me!  Thats all the pictures of fish on digital camera. Most of the others are on film.  I also have a question. I want get into steelheading because of all the big fish caught by people on this board. I just want to know what equipment i would need for float fishing. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
171647,taper,2008-03-15 04:01:00,611,Welcome aboard. Not a float fisherman but have always wanted to try. There are several guys here that will lead you in the right direction.
171650,mepps,2008-03-15 04:31:00,1301,"Welcome, nice catch!!"
171652,waterwolf,2008-03-15 04:38:00,556,"great intro, nice pic's of your sturgeon.  welcome."

171669,Big Cliff,2008-03-15 11:09:00,6899,"Glad you finally decided to join; welcome!  Can't help you much with the float fishing other than to suggest you head out to where there are people float fishing, see what they are using and ask questions. You will find that most of them are quite happy to share their passion with anyone who wants to learn."
171675,lunkerbasshunter,2008-03-15 11:18:00,2585,welcome aboard  cheers!
171677,OhioFisherman,2008-03-15 11:22:00,6623,"Welcome tibbs! Nice fish! No help on float fishing, to me a float is a bobber."
171687,fatherof3,2008-03-15 12:05:00,1769,good intro and welcome

171691,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-15 12:13:00,1183,Sturgeon sure look prehistoric.  Welcome Tibbs
171692,Gerritt,2008-03-15 12:15:00,6129,Welcome to the board! nice pics too!  as a first time steelheader a decent rod and reel are a must... alot of the serious steelheaders use centre pin reels etc... but you can fair just as well with a decent spinning outfit until you move up to the centre pin. Decent centre pins are not cheap... so make sure you enjoy standing arm to arm with hundreds of other guys fighting for your spot before dropping serious cash on one.  As for a rod a 9'-13 foot will suffice.  G
171694,Roy,2008-03-15 12:22:00,13728,"Welcome to the board, Tibbs. I can't help you with steelhead but lots of folks on here can. Ask questions, all will work out."
171705,tibbs,2008-03-15 13:02:00,650,Thanks for the warm welcome so far and answers too!
171746,Rich Clemens,2008-03-15 15:00:00,3131,"I'm not a steelheader ... but allow me to welcome you to the board TIBBS.    You know, we'll be expecting more pics - just like those you posted.     Welcome Tibbs."
171786,Bly,2008-03-15 17:46:00,1556,"Welcome to the board Tibbs.....awesome pictures!  Steelhead gear....  I would concur with Gerritt on the rod and reel.   As for other gear.....wander through the local tackle shop trout section and you should be able to find a variety of these.....    Floats... don't forget the tubing to hold them to your line..   Shot....suggest a pack with multiple sizes..   Inline swivels...small  fluorocarbon leader material....   If I use 6lb main line, leader is 4lb....  Trout hooks......size 10-12  I also like to carry a few jigs, flies and the small plastic trout worms...  Still learning myself but this should help get you started on the gear.  Have fun!!!"
171872,tibbs,2008-03-15 21:08:00,650,"Thanks Bly for the great info.  And Rich i'll definatly be posting more pics! I also have another question, what rod and spinning reel would you recommend for steelheading?"
171881,silverstreak,2008-03-15 21:49:00,146,"Hi Tibbs I can help you out a bit!!!! I have been steelheading more years than I can remember and still can't get enough of it. Before you set out on the steelhead path, I think it is only fair to warn you that steelheading can be addictive so let that be your first little bit of advice. As for catching steelhead.....my advice to you is to take the time to learn everything you can about steelhead behavior.....this means Reading everything you can about where they are and when.It also means learning which baits to use when. There are a number of Great books and mags out there which will help you with your steelhead quest. I would recomend books that discuss steelhead behavior throughout the Autumn, winter and spring months. Believe it or not, steelhead will locate in different river sections during certian parts of the yr.Again this all relates back to steelhead behavior. You can also learn alot about steelheading by just being on the river fishing and by watching others. Sometimes the best teacher is experience itself. As for baits.....I am partial to artificials as I have had great success with them over the years. Some of my fav's are steelhead Jigs (MAKE sure they are on quality hooks) Pink worms and various othe plastic presentations (see pic). Egss also work well however not always.To be honest I do not like steelhead eggs as I am a catch and release fisherman.Salmon eggs are good also and you can preserve them to last a long time. Now untill the end of May is when you will find the spring steelhead runs. I would encourage you to head upstream in a few weeks to watch the spring steelhead spawn. It's a great way to learn a little more about steelhead. Hope this helps you out a bit Tibbs. Remember..... Never stop asking yourself questions when it comes to steelhead fishing. Entering my third decade of steelheading - I always hope to have more questions than answers. Happy Learning. "
171906,tibbs,2008-03-15 22:58:00,650,Thanks Silverstreak for the great reply! I'll be definatly be picking up a book or two on steelheading!
172021,MJL,2008-03-16 04:11:00,2427,Welcome to OFC Tibbs  Great advice given by those before me.
172053,splashhopper,2008-03-16 10:15:00,2931,"welcome aboard Tibbs.   I too am new at this sport as of last fall.  My fishing master, ergo my chat name, set me up with: a) Good quality spinning reel (gonna try the pin reel this year) 6 lb test main line with 4lb leader line c) various small spilt shots( no wings) d) size 10-12 good quality hooks e) 4-5 DIFFERENT coloured floats f) very tiny GOOD quality swivels g) two very small tackle containers h) chest waders ( two sizes larger than my actual foot size to accomodate extra socks in the COOOOLLD weather) i) feet warmer packs j) packet of tiny pink plastic worms k) knowledge of where to buy roe and worms until i could catch those myself too. lol l) a fishing license n) copy of MNR regs 0) a GOOD hat light for those early morning and late night walks to / from the river p) a lighter ( to get a fire started on those COOOOLLLLLDD) days   He also had me get a few lures: LITTLE CLEO-3/8oz (one glow in the dark) and a couple of light spinners.  You will need your CAMERA to activate the glow feature in the lure AND to provide us with a pic of your BIG smile when u land your first steelhead ! lol  ....................  He then took me out to his favourite places on the Maitland and Bayfield rivers and showed me the HUGE difference in line length from float to hook.   My buddy also encouraged me to find as much info online like this.  This place has been great so far and I just joined three weeks ago. I already had one guy find me from my city and we are going out next week to see if we can bag a few.   Good luck on your new adventures.  Splashhopper"
