172272,Garry2Rs,2008-03-16 21:28:00,1425,Most of the float bowls I've seen use a neoprene gasket.  These sit in a groove and shouldn't wear out.  The leaks are generally just a stuck float or a gunky needle valve.  The needle valve is attached to the float in the float bowl.  If you remove the bowl and lift out the float the needle will come out too.  On the end of the needle you will probably find a ring of gunk.  Rub off the gunk and reassemble.  Your problem may be solved.

172318,huntervasili,2008-03-16 23:13:00,1604,Heres to hoping for a quick recovery and that ya get back on her and hear her purring just like before
172325,Bernie,2008-03-16 23:32:00,3190,Bring it by this week and I'll fix it up fer ya.  If you need any info Glen let me know. The symptoms of a stuck float needle are there. On 4 carb setups there can be some fine adjustments required on reassembly to resync.
172335,Nanook,2008-03-16 23:55:00,565,"Thats tough Glen, like losing a best friend. Hope the repair aint TOO costly for you. Shore fishing does make a nice change........sometimes."
