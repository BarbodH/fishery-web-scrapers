171973,ccmtcanada,2008-03-16 01:01:00,7971, Glen...you of all people making fun of a blurry picture???
171987,Greencoachdog,2008-03-16 01:47:00,8163,  I wonder why?
171988,Greencoachdog,2008-03-16 01:49:00,8163, You got that expletive right!!!
172017,Victor,2008-03-16 03:44:00,1609,congrats on the PB cliff!  looks like you can use another double-double ... haha ... i guess i'd rather fish than sleep as well
172018,MJL,2008-03-16 03:56:00,2427,"Cliff...You are a mind ninja who shows no mercy.  Each of these reports kills me inside knowing I still have a month to go till my schedule opens up for steel.  It's been 6 months since I last wet a line - by far the longest I've gone without fishing for as long as I can remember.  Only a month to go till I'm done school. Each day I spend an hour or so building rods...It's just not the same...  Awesome report and congrats on your catch.  Keep them coming.  In all honesty, I play with my centrepins when I read them to get me through the day. ><(((*>"
172019,huntervasili,2008-03-16 03:57:00,1604,"WTG on the PB Cliff... I hope to get douG on his first steelie, by the way... your not supposed to be the host and catch all the fish... supposed to skunk yourself so the other doesn't feel so bad  Glad to hear ya all enjoyed yourselves..."
172167,The Urban Fisherman,2008-03-16 16:24:00,2050,Nice lookin' fish Cliff!  Congrats on the PB!  I just got out ice fishing and your steelhead reports are starting up again...geez I can't keep up   Thanks for the report dude!  UF
172182,ecxstriper,2008-03-16 17:12:00,343, What ever you DouG don't try and take her nose or belly button ( ask Bly for explaination)  Way to go family your reports and making long for some warmer water and the spring run.
172379,ccmtcanada,2008-03-17 01:20:00,7971, A mind ninja?? LOL...never heard that before.  I was wondering where you were!  Water levels in my local swim are recovering...hopefully some nice carp will work their way back this spring....maybe we'll see you out here again at that point!
172476,mattyk,2008-03-17 13:08:00,2110,"some nice looking fish, thanks for sharing!"
171776,ccmtcanada,2008-03-15 17:16:00,7971,"We told douG back in the fall that we'd take him out sometime Steelheading.  We are by no means experts in the field, but we have a handle on the basics.  He arrived at our place at 645 this morning and after showing him how to rig, we piled in the car and headed to the trib.  I was surprised to see only 1 other car in the parking lot!  I figured that because the conditions were pretty good last night that I'd see lots of people out there.   Water was a little stained...about 6 to 8 inches visibility.  Anyhow, we began drifting close to 8am and for some reason, I was the only one who caught any fish....maybe it's also because douG's waders didn't fit so he couldn't fish on the good side of this particular spot...LOL.  Roe wasn't doing a whole lot for me, so I switched up to a white/gold fly and sure enough there were fish in the area!  The first one to come in was a little female...    Bly and douG were headed to another hole, and as they were walking past on the opposite bank, my float went down again and I got a nice dropback.  douG had a great vantage point from the opposite bank....higher up....and he took this pic of me fighting it.... Notice my nice colour co-ordinated look? LOL   Here's the fish....nice colours.....   I had no intention of leaving this hole quite yet...a few more drifts and this large male... now my PB at 29"" came in.  This one put up quite the fight...but my 6lb test handled the job quite nicely.   We then took a little break for lunch...and tried another spot without any luck.  I was really hoping that we could get douG into his first steelie ever....he had a nice hit, but the fish had other ideas.  We also finally met fellow OFNer, Kemper...it was great chatting with you...hope you had a good day out there.  Anyhow, we had a GREAT morning with you douG...we'll do it again sometime....and hopefully get you into some fish....oh yeah...go get some new waders...LOL."

I MIGHT take a quick run out there for a few hours, weather permitting later in the week!"
171836,Mike the Pike,2008-03-15 19:37:00,3421,Nice fish and pics Cliff WTG on the PB.  What no pics of Bly and DouG.  Would like to have seen a funny pic of DouG in his rubber tights  Bly he is taking all the spotlight.

171865,silverstreak,2008-03-15 20:38:00,146,Sounds like a fun morning. Gotta love pulling into an empty parking lot. Peace.
171870,douG,2008-03-15 21:07:00,2693,"Cliff, Carole, youse guys rock.  The hospitality was perfect, ( fresh coffee, and let me show you how I rig for steelhead, do you have roe?), conversation was stimulating, and we even caught some fine chrome.  Well, Cliff did anyway.  Cliff and Carole have a reputation on this board for being the consummate hosts (that is extra, extra good), and it is well deserved.  Lovely folks, with great kids too.  Any parent knows that happy, confident children are a pleasure and a blessing, and they have this in spades.  A pleasure to meet Sam and Kidney.  Skidley.  Kibbley.  Stinky. Something like that.  Sydney, is your finger still a little bit wobbly, like it might just pop off the knuckle?  Wear gloves, is my suggestion.  Looking forward to the next time, many thanks for a great morning.  Best,  douG"
171873,Spiel,2008-03-15 21:24:00,9065,"....Looks like a great way to spend a morning. And don't sell yourself short Doug, like Cliff and Carole you too are fine folk and great host."
171933,ccmtcanada,2008-03-15 23:45:00,7971,Wow...thanks douG!  It was our pleasure to have you join us today...and the invite is a standing invitation...just let us know when you have a little time and would like to get together!  I'd love to get you on your first steelhead soon!  Sydney had a great time....and was asking me how to do that finger trick long after you left....LOL.  And Spiel...you have it right too....douG is a great guy....we got to know him a little at Lakair last summer and we were room mates at the Quinte G2G.  And thanks for over riding the profanity filters....haha.  Until next time douG!
171953,Greencoachdog,2008-03-16 00:24:00,8163,"  OMG!!! It's a radioactive Brainwave fish!!!  ... I hope this was your Sushi tonight, because if you ever let them breed..."
171959,Moosebunk,2008-03-16 00:37:00,3970,Hey Cliff... good job with da PB man.  What was that fish anyways... 10 inches in your wee hobbit palms.  j/k  Nice bow dood.
