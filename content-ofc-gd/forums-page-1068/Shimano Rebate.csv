162121,bucktail,2008-02-19 21:36:00,1857,I was reading the fine print and it seems the 50 dollar Shimano rebate is only good in the states. Since the dollars are the same I wonder why it doesnt include Canada. Bummer!!!!
162124,wkrp,2008-02-19 21:52:00,656,It is available in Canada. LB and  BPS have the forms. I bought a Curado  and had my rebate within 3 weeks from Shimano Canada
162281,setomonkey,2008-02-20 04:37:00,872,"Hi guys,  First I heard of this rebate. How long does it last, and is it good for all Shimano reels? I had been thinking of picking up a new baitcasting reel this winter...  Thanks, Mike"
162350,wkrp,2008-02-20 13:35:00,656,The rebates are good until April 30.  Curado $50 Citica $30 Cruxis $20.
172193,setomonkey,2008-03-16 17:49:00,872,"Thanks again guys, I bought a Citica yesterday and got the coupon from the retailer for the $30 rebate.  Mike"

Just make sure you ask when you are in the store. My cousin bought last year and had to talk with the manager because the rebate wasnt valid in Canada. BPS gave him a gift card for the amount to compensate."
