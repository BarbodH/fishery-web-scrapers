171730,Big Cliff,2008-03-15 13:58:00,6899,"Sue decided she wants the inside of our house repainted, I've been working at it but have to admit I'm a much better cook than I am a painter.  I would be willing to trade a weekend for two at our place with all food supplied, (just look at me and you'll know we eat well LOL) boat, motor, I'll even take you out if you would prefer. You'll have to bring your own booze. Accomodations are fairly comfortable; guest room, family room with fire place, 4 pc. bath, walk out to the lake, cable TV.  I will supply all the paint (good quality) and materials, ladders, drop cloths rollers etc.. I am only guessing but I think someone that knows what they are doing could do it in two days but it might take three. If it takes more than three days we'll add extra days of fishing to compensate.  Location: Lindsay Work can be done on weekends or evenings (or week days if you are available)  Work must be compleated within the next three weeks: Sue is fussy but not unreasonable but we do expect a good job.  Fishing dates to be arranged for any time this spring, summer, fall, we'll do our best to accomodate you.  Let me know if you are interested."

172044,Roy,2008-03-16 09:36:00,13728,"Wish I could help, Cliff. But, the daily commute would kill me."
172046,Big Cliff,2008-03-16 09:41:00,6899,You can come and stay Roy!

172236,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-16 20:04:00,1183,I will be painting for the first time myself...and so went online to get some tips and came across a new little gadget called an Accubrush..check it out at Painthelpers.com...it looks amazing for cutting.  I want one but can't seem to locate it anywhere here in Canada.  Would anyone know where I could pick one up?
172343,Nanook,2008-03-17 00:13:00,565,"Cliff; If ya dont get any offers. give me a call. I've always done my own painting, and maybe help you out a bit. No charge! LOL"
172436,Big Cliff,2008-03-17 09:23:00,6899,"Thank you very much Jack, very kind of you and I might just take you up on your offer. We'll see how this week goes. My son and daughter-in-law might be coming down for the weekend so problem might be solved.  I'll let you know."
172437,Spiel,2008-03-17 09:42:00,9065,"....I used to do a lot of interior painting (hated it) and would more than love to help Cliff if'n I was only closer. Alas that is not the case but the offer is a generous one, I surprised you're not getting more bites."
