172284,OhioFisherman,2008-03-16 21:55:00,6623,"I don`t remember exactly when BigFish recommended it but I have been using the AVG free edition ever since, no problems. Like 2004-2005?"
172285,KyleM,2008-03-16 21:57:00,218,AVG is the best thing Ive used and Ive had zero problems since I started.  Its free and it dosnt slow everything up like Norton.
172287,splashhopper,2008-03-16 21:58:00,2931,Yep.. AVG ffrom grisoft.com   BEST i ever used too and does NOT bog the puter down.
172294,huntervasili,2008-03-16 22:22:00,1604,Yeah! Norton SUCKS! lol slows my comp down way too much
172300,FisherMike,2008-03-16 22:39:00,108,Try going to download.com.  There are usually a few different ones there.  I got Threatfire from there and it seems to work pretty well.  I have no complaints so far.  Ive had it for about four months.  It is a free download.

172305,Guest lundboy,2008-03-16 22:48:00,0,"AVG is great for free.  If you want to pay for a good one (that's small and doesn't bog you down)....  http://www.eset.com/download/index.php   30 day trial, one of the best.  Here's a link of comparisons and reviews of the 2008 virus protection products:  http://anti-virus-software-review.toptenreviews.com/"
172324,Burtess,2008-03-16 23:30:00,901,"I have always used Norton (actually Symantec Corporate Edition - I assume its the same thing) and never had any problems with bogging down...  That being said, I use Avast on my kids computer and my wife prefers it also....  www.avast.com  They never have any problems with it...  Burt"
172328,BillM,2008-03-16 23:34:00,17367,"Never been a fan of antivirus programs..   I like Lavasoft's Adaware and Spybot Search and Destroy.  I've never had a virus yet, and I do this computer stuff for a living  The biggest thing people need to do is NOT open attachments in emails they get from people they don't know.  You double click the attachment and think 'hrm, nothing is happening'  well that's not the case...  More then likely a trojan or another nasty is running in the background without you even knowing.  I also like to use sites like Gmail/Hotmail instead of programs like Outlook/Outlook Express for personal email.  Take a few precautions and you'll most likely never have an issue."
172334,holdfast,2008-03-16 23:49:00,1813,"Thanks for your help guys.  Ill try avast and see how that works, gots to be better than Norton.  Thanks again"
