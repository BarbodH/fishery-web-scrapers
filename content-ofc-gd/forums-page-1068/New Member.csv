I've heard there is a really good run of Walleye in the spring in the Detroit river.  Since I don't have a boat does any one know of any good shore casting spots that I might be able to get into them?  or perhaps get some roaming Pike??  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!"

Every year the Extreme Team X heads down that way to fish the river and from what I've been told they have a blast on the river.  He does Charters down that way! http://www.chartertalk.com/    would be his site to check on.   Extreme Army Team Robert""Spike"" Broadbridge"

Check out the one by Mooseroo from last October about ""Heading To Windsor...""  You'll find some good bits of info that might be useful to ya."
172331,outllaw,2008-03-16 23:48:00,1232,"try next to lilly kazillys resyuarant in spring. also lakeview park marina before they open the west wall is best. also you can try at ambassador park. the walleyes will be soon. the ice is slowly rotting. with a year round season and a 6 fish limit, im sure you will enjoy a few fillets if you desire. try wallys baits at sandwhich and mill street. they have great info."
