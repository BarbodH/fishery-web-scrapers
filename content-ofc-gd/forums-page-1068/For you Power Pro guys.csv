171602,danbouck,2008-03-15 01:51:00,4380,Walmart (at least the one in Cambridge) started selling powerpro and it is CHEAP! got 150yds of 40lb for 13 bucks!
171620,SlowPoke,2008-03-15 02:23:00,2984,"Thanks Dan, I'll have that in mind for spool season... JUST AROUND THE CORNER!!!"
171639,BillM,2008-03-15 03:18:00,17367,I'll have to stop by tomorrow and take a look!  Thanks for the heads up!
171658,Sinker,2008-03-15 05:51:00,8692,I'll ask the wife to get me some while I'm out fishing tomorrow
171683,silveradosheriff,2008-03-15 11:47:00,1025,Great price - thanks Dan!
171686,jonnybass,2008-03-15 11:57:00,346, It's all good as long as the wife doesn't decide to get her some while you be out fishing
171842,fishindevil,2008-03-15 19:49:00,6254,"Great price,i will check out the wal-mart around here for some thanks !!!!"
171850,Garry2Rs,2008-03-15 20:08:00,1425,That is in line with the US Wal-Mart pricing. It's about time!
171888,pikehunter,2008-03-15 22:16:00,1659,"I saw it at one of the Walmarts around Hamilton a couple of weeks ago, the one down the street from me though didn't have it.  Question: The weight I wanted was colour RED I haven't seen red before and didn't buy it for this reason. Would red P.P be alright to use? Advantage or disadvantage?  Thanks."
171890,FISHINGNUT,2008-03-15 22:29:00,253,I use red I find I can see it better but the colour does fade any ways after a while
171900,Ben_Daniels,2008-03-15 22:44:00,435,"Supposedly the red line ""disappears"" in 15 feet of water or deeper...it actually just appears black though. I do a lot of fishing for largemouth in less than 10 ft. of water so I personally wouldn't use it. I think it would be fine in deeper water.  -Ben"
171905,pikehunter,2008-03-15 22:54:00,1659,"That is what I was just thinking Ben. In the shallow water, under 15' it may hinder success. Most of my fishing is exactly as you said, either river fishing or for bass so red may be a bad choice.  Thanks for the help guys."
172304,Garry2Rs,2008-03-16 22:48:00,1425,"This winter I am using red 10lbs. PowerPro on my spinning reels. I bought it for the visibility, but it's so fine it's not that big a help to me. In my opinion, the line colour will not bother the fish. You should be more concerned with line drag in a current or the shadow a line casts, than it's colour. I will report back when I get a chance to test the red PowerPro in clear water."
