889124,Fisherpete,2014-12-29 17:38:00,1814,I've been trying for days to contact someone there with no luck to find out if they are open - the phone menus are not working properly. Does anyone have a direct line to the repair shop? Or does anyone know their holiday hours? Want to drop by tomorrow or Wednesday.  Thanks Pete
