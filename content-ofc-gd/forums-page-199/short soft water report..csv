Marked more than our outing a few weeks ago but only managed 1 which my son caught dragging a plastic tipped jig head and we saw 3 more caught around us.  Water hovered around 33 degrees but with no ice to be seen today and high winds present, ice formation will be held at bay. Although it will be much colder than today, Tuesdays forecast (if it holds) still leaves us some options.   Stay tuned? Hope so."
