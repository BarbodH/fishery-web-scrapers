For Christmas this year my girlfriend,brother and his girlfriend all decided we would go ice fishing together for a day instead of doing presents we'd do an adventure together, so we're looking at finding an operator on simcoe, not really particular on species just an operator that has a good track record for keeping you busy as I know my girlfriend and more than likely my brothers will get restless without something going on haha.  So with all that being said if you were choosing a day out on simcoe (or somewhere within reasonable distance for a day trip) where and who would you be going with?  Thanks for any and all input and merry Christmas"
888631,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-26 01:21:00,956,I've gone with a guy named Peter (705-456-0000) a few times and he's pretty good.  He runs a bunch of huts called Ice Cabins of Gilford.  None stop perch action all day.  Good luck
888639,Joeytier,2014-12-26 02:13:00,3990,I reccomend a boat.
888642,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-26 03:41:00,956,LOL.  So much for ice fishing this Christmas break.
888667,RickOnt,2014-12-26 15:55:00,669,"The Perching on Simcoe is for sure ""On Hold' at this time.  What area of the Lake are you looking at?  For Cook's Bay out of Gilford.    Terry Goy would be the operator I would recommend.  Beaverton area Tim Hale's"
