Soon to be 6, he's made a few trips last year and a few more this year but this was the first time I've got a bird while he has been with me. My oversized hunting coat barely fit afterward."
888206,Fisherman,2014-12-23 00:44:00,7201,Nice work and they're tasty.
888226,richyb,2014-12-23 03:33:00,774,Congrats !!! were you up where I met you ? I haven't seen very many birds around but the other guy I trap with says he sees lots but they are staying high in the trees.

888262,captpierre,2014-12-23 14:31:00,2521,Beautiful shot of your boy  Cherrish these times.

888294,Beavertail,2014-12-23 20:25:00,331,"I can only imagine how fun that would be for him at such a young age! (The smile kinda gives it away) Like they say...you never forget your first. I'm sure he can't wait till it's his turn to pull the trigger, a hunter is born."
888299,Joeytier,2014-12-23 21:07:00,3990,Very nice
888306,Big Cliff,2014-12-23 22:02:00,6899,"What a beautiful memory has been created! Good on you, good for your son!"
888350,grimsbylander,2014-12-24 00:48:00,3016,"I grew up in Grey County and there used to be a very healthy grouse population. At 15 years old, grouse and rabbit hunting was a thrill. Looks like it still is!"
888351,Beavertail,2014-12-24 00:53:00,331,I hunt in Grey County...still plenty of grouse and bunnies to be had!
888381,richyb,2014-12-24 03:35:00,774, Yes. My impression is that there are less this year as well.  The fisher population is very high this year in the area and they do a number on them bush chickens. We filled our fisher quota pretty fast and there are still tracks everywhere.
888398,kickingfrog,2014-12-24 10:17:00,8333,"Interesting, havn't seen much in the way of bunny sign this year either."
888420,Rod Caster,2014-12-24 13:31:00,5784,Good stuff. Did the boy clean the bird?  Grouse #'s down here too this year..
888428,woodenboater,2014-12-24 14:46:00,2277,Niice ! smile says it all. Don't see much sign of grouse on my property but rabbits are ok and plenty of deer. and bear
888438,fishnsled,2014-12-24 15:23:00,3520,Awesome way to spend some time with your son.  The success in the hunt is a bonus.  Good stuff!

I haven't seen very many birds around but the other guy I trap with says he sees lots but they are staying high in the trees.  You know I would have thought as well....they were reeeeeely skittish and I didn't see many early in the season. But that changed during my deer hunt this year. I could have clubbed a few lol...  And the hares were out in force as well, I had to call my dogs off several times while driving for Bambi. We have fishers as well but what was noticably different this year...i saw next to no wolf and coyote sign. I'm not sure what drove them out, but I'm glad  Great shot of your son though, the beginings of great family tradition right there"
