888649,lew,2014-12-26 11:09:00,12766,"We normally do a turkey and a ham but switched it up this year and did a prime rib bought from a local butcher in town and it was absolutely amazing. Put it in a 500 degree oven for 20 minutes then lowered it to 300 and when it came out it was perfect.  Did veggies, Yorkshire Puddings and mashed Yukon Gold with it then finished it off with my wifes home made trifle and I was a happy man."

Maribeth and I had four kids each from our first marriages...They gave us 16 grandkids... then they gave us 6 great-grandkids as far as we know as they are scattered all over and some are not in touch...and that is just our contribution to the total...Lol  Maribeth is one of nine children so the number multiplies quickly...  No great-greats yet...our latest great was a week ago yesterday...
