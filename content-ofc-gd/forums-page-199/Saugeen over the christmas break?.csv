With all this warm rain, I figure the steelhead will be making their way into the mouth of the river.  I'll be drifting roe bags, any tips on where and when?  Thanks so much!  "

888715,ketchenany,2014-12-26 20:48:00,3229,"YES my man when we had the huts off the Oro ninth in the 80s the first thing was to put on the 12 cup espressos on the stove. Then a luch of veal or Italin sausages on buns. Nothing better than having a frying pan going all day long. How I miss those days.  Sorry for the Geen trek, may have thrown him off track! Listen to BillM."
888735,KraTToR,2014-12-26 23:01:00,506,How did we get from steelheading to coffee...LOL.  Not a tims coffee fan but I do like me a warm apple fritter.  Guess the season is blown but Mrs. K will be happy.  Its warm enough for me to clean out the garage..
