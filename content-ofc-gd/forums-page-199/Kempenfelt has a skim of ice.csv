889329,kickingfrog,2014-12-30 20:40:00,8333,Most of the bay has a skim of ice but there are still some open spots that all the divers are gathering at. Snow squalls in the forecast. I read recently that patience isn't how long you wait for something but how you wait.
889330,Terry,2014-12-30 20:50:00,14456,it's the wind that will bugger it up
889331,davey buoy,2014-12-30 20:58:00,5505,"I can vouch for that,95% anyway frozen.Still a long way to go guys.The temps do look in our favor."
889336,misfish,2014-12-30 21:28:00,29133,Yup  BBP 1 HOUR AGO.        The main lake  
889341,BillM,2014-12-30 22:19:00,17367,As long as the winds stay calm we'll be good.
889342,Burtess,2014-12-30 22:22:00,901,Keeping the fingers crossed for the next 24 hours.... hopefully it thickens enough in spite of the wind forecast.  Burt
889343,misfish,2014-12-30 22:24:00,29133,As long as the winds stay calm we'll be good.   Now thats positive thinking. Head of the class you go Bill. LOL

889345,BillM,2014-12-30 22:29:00,17367,"Terry, to the back of the room!  lol!"
889346,misfish,2014-12-30 22:33:00,29133,"Terry, to the back of the room!  lol!  Yes,in the corner with Davey."
889352,Terry,2014-12-30 22:57:00,14456,we could get some big sheets and hold them up and block the wind if that would help
