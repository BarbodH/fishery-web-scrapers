889347,Christopheraaron,2014-12-30 22:33:00,3525,"Remember that big speck I got and that other that Chris B got, and all of those little guys? They were all on worms!"
889348,Musky or Specks,2014-12-30 22:41:00,2710,How did you fish them Chris just hook and sinker or tiping a lure?
889351,Christopheraaron,2014-12-30 22:50:00,3525,Just a hook and split shot but tipping jigs works too.
889378,Joeytier,2014-12-31 02:53:00,3990,"Ohhh yeah, just have to factor in keeping them warm, because they do freeze very easily"
889383,SirCranksalot,2014-12-31 03:25:00,3291,I've caught specks on a small piece of beef in the winter.
