Call me paranoid but I'm worried I'll get turned around or lost or eaten by bigfoot.  Does anyone know of a place that rents huts overnight that would be on a good Burbot lake? Distance isn't really an issue"
889368,Musky or Specks,2014-12-31 01:42:00,2710,Any of the on ice bungalows on Temagami would give you the action but I think you would have to rent them for 24hrs
889369,Acountdeleted,2014-12-31 01:49:00,2562,No problems there. Thanks for the info.
889375,Joeytier,2014-12-31 02:49:00,3990,Nipissing is an obvious choice.  Things get lingy after dark out there.  I'll even join ya if i can
889380,Acountdeleted,2014-12-31 03:02:00,2562,Sweet. I'm in. A little closer of a drive then Temagami too.
889384,e-z-out,2014-12-31 03:31:00,1052,I second Lake Nipissing I've stayed over night and the fishing was great.
889428,Rod Caster,2014-12-31 13:17:00,5784,"Papineau Lake near Mattawa. Great night-burbot action...but they are fairly small there. Might be some rentals there, not too sure."
