888804,super dave,2014-12-27 16:31:00,323,My brother has a skidoo touring.   Starts up fine but it stalls out after 30 seconds.  We did a quick carb cleaning and it didn't seem to improve it.   Any thoughts?
888807,ecmilley,2014-12-27 16:53:00,2163,Engine would help. Did you remove carbs to clean. Check carb boots for tears ! (Most common) Try turning up idle usually 1500rpm
888844,Joeytier,2014-12-27 20:43:00,3990,Does it run better once the motor is warm?
888892,super dave,2014-12-27 22:20:00,323,No Joey.  It will always conk out after a minute.  Even if we Rev it.   any more thoughts?   Just hoping it's something we can fix. Otherwise we'll have to take her in.
888897,BillM,2014-12-27 22:33:00,17367,Floats?  Sounds like you're running out of fuel.
888912,ecmilley,2014-12-27 23:23:00,2163,"i could bring up carb boots again, but you havnt even given the engine yet, good thing I dont need ofc to fix my crap"
888918,super dave,2014-12-28 00:06:00,323,96 ski doo touring 340 e.  I don't have any knowledge of fixing these things. Just trying to help.out my brother.   I know a lot of guys here run sleds so just wanted some opinions.
888925,Freshtrax,2014-12-28 00:40:00,2215,I would say something in the choke system or the fuel pump.
888926,Freshtrax,2014-12-28 00:42:00,2215,Carb boots if they were cracked should in theory run up the idle speed.
888955,musky666,2014-12-28 15:41:00,126,"If it was fuel related you could goose her and keep her running somehow- primer/choke, starting fluid etc. Sounds electrical to me and not related to the just cleaned cards- I say its the mag/coil/ plug leads"
888964,irishfield,2014-12-28 16:28:00,26272,Let it start and then die... then pull a spark plug out and see if it's wet or dry. If dry it's not getting fuel.. if wet it's flooding itself somehow.  Is it being started with a plunger type primer? or just a choke?  If a plunger primer can he keep it running on the plunger? If he can.. fuel pump... or clogged jets. or as others have clearly stated already ripped carb boots and engine is just sucking air.  Is the shake of start up grounding the kill switch wires somewhere?
889054,206,2014-12-29 04:50:00,563,Not to sound rude but is it fresh gas??
