889194,SirCranksalot,2014-12-29 22:19:00,3291,"I have a couple of small ice-fishing related projects that(ideally at least) would involve gluing polyethylene. Normal glues will not work on this. I have searched on-line for suitable products, Some recommended products: Loctite Plastix, 3M Spray 72 or 90, Weld-On 600 made by the IPS Corporation. Supposedly Home Depot and Rona carry some of these products, but local stores don't seem to have them and I can't seem to be able to order on-line and have it delivered, unless I order from the US and pay a steep delivery charge.   Any ideas or suggestions? Thx"

889207,NANUK,2014-12-29 23:36:00,797,"Not too many choices when it comes to gluing polyethylene, don't waste your time & money on different adhesives and super glues. Hot air welding is the best but needs special skill, equipment and shop settings. There is Poly-Weld, it requires heat treatment of both surfaces, proper preparation is crucial with this product. http://www.tapplastics.com/product/repair_products/plastic_adhesives/tap_poly_weld_adhesive/435  Mechanical fasteners like screws, bolts & nuts are easiest and most effective but not always practical."
889214,irishfield,2014-12-30 00:06:00,26272,"I've found the best way to bond Polyethylene is to grind it back up into pellets and run it back through the injection moulding machine.  Even I have never had any luck doing anything else and I've been in plastics for 29 years. I have been known to repair some things.... but in a crude, non-structural way, with some heat and a large soldering gun to rejoin something in a pinch."

I found this at H Depot. I don't need very much for my project so I'll try this and use it sparingly-----'stitch weld' the pieces together maybe. I might need 2 of these.   http://www.homedepot.ca/product/lepageltsupgtreglt-supgt-superltsupgtreglt-supgt-glue-all-plastics/973100"
