After a night of merriment they break out the PICKLED HERRING. Solaman Grundy or some God awefull thing. The worst hangage I ever had. I can't even walk down the canned fish aisle to this day.

While it is still damp, add kosher salt, garlic powder and onion powder and crushed black pepper. Let is sit for at least an hour. Then dredge them in flour, egg wash and bread crumbs (we like Panko!) and pan fry until golden brown. Put the fried pieces in the oven for 1/2 an hour at 325 to finish cooking through.

I was warned but my Japanese isn't very good and the Sake was warm and plentiful. It was very good but I'm not going out and catching any and cooking them up any time soon. The brain is a complex organ.  My mother cooked liver like Beans' Mom, until you could resole a shoe. I ate it with copious amounts of onions and Ketchup or didn't eat that night.

Spinach and Tangerine Soup Ingredients:1.5 l chicken stock75 g yellow split peas25 g unsalted butter100 g spring onions, chopped1 tsp ground turmeric225 g fresh spinach, finely chopped40 g parsley, chopped50 g coriander, choppedGrated zest of 2 tangerinesJuice of 3 tangerines20 g ground rice or rice flour150 ml cold water225 g natural yoghurt Cooking Instructions:Soak the split peas over night. The following day add the chicken stock to a pan and bring to a boil. Drain the split peas and add to the pan. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a pan and add the spring onions. Fry gently for 5 minutes before adding the turmeric. Fry for 1 minutes then add the cold water and ground rice and stir in. Transfer the contents of the pan to the stock pot then add the coriander, spinach, parsley and tangerine zest and juice to the pan, cover and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionaly. Ladle the soup into dishes, garnish with a dollop of yoghurt and sprinkle fresh corinader over the top. Serve immediately.  Another thing is fish jerky.    There is a sweet tasting fish called Filefish that is popular in Korea.   It stinks really bad,. but has a natural sweet taste to it.    Probably not for everyone, especially if you smell it first!

887053,bigugli,2014-12-16 18:03:00,6138," As a scoutmaster, I would usually organize a stone soup cookout during campouts .  They would get told a version of the story, and as the story was told, each cub or scout would take their turn adding their contribution to the pot. There was just one twist. Scouter Bruce contributed the meat, and that remained a big secret until all had stuffed themselves full.  I was also known for serving up breakfasts of ""train smash"" or ""Green eggs and ham"""
887080,DanD,2014-12-16 18:45:00,2223,"Beef Tongue Read on if I haven't already grossed you out?  - One tongue from freshly slaughtered beef. - Wash and if need be scrub with brush. - Place in pot large enough to cover tongue with water. - Season water with bay leaves (2 or 3) and a TB spoon of pepper corns. - Bring to a mild boil - Meat is cooked when the shin has turned a pale white and a knife can be easily inserted. - Remove from pot and allow to cool too the touch; you don't want it cold for the next step. - Peel shin from the tongue to expose the meat. Take your time it can be a bit difficult to remove all the skin without wasting to much of the meat. - Slice meat into 1/4"" thick slices - Place meat in a stewing pot, add either home make or canned tomato sauce; spiced too your liking. - Saute onions, garlic and fresh peppers until tender; add to sauce. - Bring everything up to a medium high simmer and allow to cook for approx 2-3 hours. - Serve with any form of pasta and garlic bread. The simmering of the meat and sauce can also be done in a slow cooker and left longer without worry of burning.  If you're willing to try it once; it won't be the last time you'd eat it.  Dan."
887094,lew,2014-12-16 19:46:00,12766, I'm a big fan of liver   Same here Joe and my wife does a fantastic job with cooking it but a few of us had dinner at another  friends home recently and he did his differently and it was also excellent.  He started off simmering 10 pounds of onions in a big skillet and then put the liver straight onto the BBQ grill. When it was half cooked he took it off the Q and buried it all down in the onions and simmered it all on low with the cover on the pan.  Served that up with 10 pounds of Yukon Gold taters and it was some of the best liver I've ever had.
887095,Headhunter,2014-12-16 19:59:00,5703,That does sound good Lew! I've never bbq'd it before! Brilliant! HH
887102,misfish,2014-12-16 21:21:00,29133,"  LOL Joe,and you wont eat smelts.  I love calves liver. 2 minutes a side and done. Good splash of HP and good to go."
887103,Gerritt,2014-12-16 21:29:00,6129,Gross on many many levels.
887105,bigugli,2014-12-16 21:43:00,6138,"  Love liver as long as it is not overcooked, tender with a hint of pink, served with a mountain of fried onions and bacon. I have no problem chowing down on that for breakfast, lunch or supper."
886894,manitoubass2,2014-12-16 01:42:00,11391,"Well I for one love cooking. I love old staples, I love cultural dishes, simple meals etc. but more then anything I love experimenting in the kitchen.  I cant be the only one. feel free to post some of your experiments or just new to you dishes for everyone to try...  tonight I wanted something simple but I was craving mushrooms. so I winged it at the grocery store then again at home and made something really tasty and easy.  first I got on a good beef stock. I wasnt sure how much I would need for the family so I over guessed and made 14 cups lol. better to have too much then not enought.  as I brought my broth to a simmer I added a touch of oil and butter to a frypan and got some nice onions going to sweat. a lil salt and pepper and garlic.  Now I ended up adding adding two cloves of garlic and a whole onion to my broth.  once my onions were done I added them to my broth.  now I added a crap ton of mushrooms to the frypan with some more butter and salt and pepper and now some minced garlic.  I cooked them right down too a good mouth full size. I used criminis  Now I added a lil cooked and drained beef to the soup. as well as some long grain brown rice.  I portioned it into bowls, added the mushrooms to the top, topped with a nice fresh soft mozza, and served with a piece of my better halfs homemade garlic bread.  super simple and quick but it was nice...  between 8 of us 14 cups worked out perfect to two bowls each?"

886908,manitoubass2,2014-12-16 03:12:00,11391,"lol thanks Randy but thats a ""leftover lets see what we can do night"" lol. and post some pics!!! id love to see them! im always looking for inspiration/ideas  tasty as all heck but not very purdy.  LOA. if you like plain hot dogs in the micworave try a pack of spicy chicken ramen noodles, crush, put in bowl and fill half way with water. cook in mic for 2 1/2 mins. let cool. crush cool ranch doritos over top.  sometimes eating like crap doesnt mean it tastes like crap lol"

886914,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-16 03:31:00,956,"Sounds easy to put together.  Was planning on cooking lobster one night, but I'm thinking thats a big jump from cooking hot dogs."
886915,manitoubass2,2014-12-16 03:37:00,11391,lobster is easy.  if its pre prepaired just add to a skillet of butter and garlic. cooking time depends on size but its only a few minutes. add some pepper and chives or parsley after cooked and viola!  serve over a bed of minute rice cooked in chicken stock instead of water.  serve with a sparkley zindfandel wine and your good to go
886917,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-16 03:39:00,956,I'm thinking of bringing the lobster home alive lol.  Go big or go home right lol
886919,manitoubass2,2014-12-16 03:41:00,11391,"but honestly if your gonna spend money on a lobster or two, personally id rather grab a few new york strip steaks, mushrooms, onion and potatoes.  youll get way more flavor and bang for your buck"
886920,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-16 03:43:00,956,I will PM you when the time comes.  You can give me step by step instructions lol  Thanks
886921,manitoubass2,2014-12-16 03:44:00,11391, if you get a live lobster just boil it and prepare it. im sure there is one million youtube vids showing how. i still suggest a light cook after in butter garlic though. mmmm
886922,manitoubass2,2014-12-16 03:50:00,11391,"cooking is just fun though man. just try and experiment. eventually you make awesome dishes.  you see some of the pics on this site? friggen amazing looking and im sure they taste even better(a pic never does good food justice)  but these members were not born to cook, they learned.  its fun and when you make a dish thats a hit you hang on to it and move along"
886950,Joey,2014-12-16 11:27:00,9122,"Wow, those dogs look great  Lately I've had a hankering for that smoked salmon/lox, so as I've progressed with my addiction to it, I now buy a nice baguette, one of those long ones, then cut it into smaller pieces of course, then toast up two pieces.  Then I take an avacado and make a quacamole (just basically smush up half of the avacado and add garlic, salt and pepper.)  So then after the toast is done, I put butter, cream cheese, then the quac, then I put chopped up red onions, the smoked salmon and some capers.   Yummmmmmmm!!!!"

Great recipe, but if you want one quick change that might improve it, here is how I do basically the same thing.  I would only put in about 1/4 of the sauce mixture and some ginger ale to cook the ribs or pork. Then when it is almost cooked I would discard that liquid and put in the rest of the sauce mixture and cook for about an hour on high.  The reason I would do that is most of the fat that comes out of the pork as it cooks will dilute the sauce, also that heavy an amount of fat in a sauce cloys the taste buds. Lastly, I would add a 1/4 cup of a good quality honey mustard to the sauce mix for pork.  I use the above method for making my peach schnapps pulled pork and have found that after discarding the liquid it cooks in, the flavor is more intense on the finished product as it isn't diluted by what is essentially a cup or two of lard that has rendered out of the meat during the cooking process..."

By the time I go through the cupboard and the freezers, cleaning out remnants, I wind up with this massive pot of stew. Never turns out the same, but it always tastes darn good and never lasts long.  Kinda like making ""stone soup"""
