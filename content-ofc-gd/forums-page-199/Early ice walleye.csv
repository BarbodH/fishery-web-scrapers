889227,Freshtrax,2014-12-30 00:31:00,2215,I'm headed up to muskoka jan 1 for some early Ice walleye .  I'm not a walleye fisherman by any means the only place I ever fish them is the French river at the end of the summer.    From what people have told me  steep drops to the main basin near shallow feeding flats.   Sound about right?   I plan on using minnows and flashy spoons.   All this seems to make since In my head. Anyone have anything else to add.?
889228,Freshtrax,2014-12-30 00:31:00,2215,Would creek mouths be worth investigating?
889235,c10,2014-12-30 00:59:00,131,Lake Muskoka is not frozen yet though if that is the lake you were planning on hitting says my buddy in Bracebridge.  Sent you a PM
889241,Freshtrax,2014-12-30 01:12:00,2215,I'm assuming the lake I'm headed too will be safe after the night times this week.   Will obviously have to use due diligence.  Not lake muskoka.
889242,c10,2014-12-30 01:15:00,131,"Yes, that is what I am hoping as well!"
889300,FishAbout,2014-12-30 16:57:00,106,Mostly open water on lake muskoka. I would not count on walking on muskoka for at least another week. Been to windy here for ice to forum. I hope we don't get the snow they are calling for. I drove by the lake yesturday and very little ice. Small lakes that were froze back in November should be okay.

889332,NAW,2014-12-30 21:07:00,4022,Wups...  Douplicate reply.....
889355,Freshtrax,2014-12-30 23:12:00,2215," It's in muskoka,   Not lake muskoka like I said earlier  but thanks for the info."
889361,ecmilley,2014-12-31 00:24:00,2163,Depends on lake your fishing. I fish shallow early in year off weeds if i can find them still lots of oxygen in shallow. Breaks and drops all productive as the year moves creeks and riverouth area get good
