888712,solopaddler,2014-12-26 20:39:00,8605,"Stumbled onto these and couldn't resist. I'd never even heard of or seen weedless Williams spoons in my life. The guy selling them has boxes of them, all unopened in the original package. He told me they were a minimum of 40 years old and I believe him.  I bought a whack of them to fish with, but does anyone think these might be worth anything?  Regardless they're a pretty cool find.  "
888713,crappieperchhunter,2014-12-26 20:42:00,2582,"I can remember them being in our local Canadian Tire when I started fishing and was old enough to get my own tackle, which would have been the mid 70's.  Sorry I can't answer any questions with regards to there worth."
888720,RDR,2014-12-26 21:09:00,125,Nice find Mike! Hook me up with some of those. I could probably put them to good use this coming year
888721,kickingfrog,2014-12-26 21:33:00,8333,The company is still located in Peterborough I think. It shouldn't be too hard to dig up some info. Mid '70's does seem about right.

The plant where these spoons came from was in Fort Erie. He grabbed boxes and boxes of all different kinds of lures when they were closing up shop many years ago.  
888728,bigugli,2014-12-26 22:13:00,6138,I used to have them back in the 70's. Gold weedless Williams and  weedless Johnson silvers were great for pike in thick weeds.

888834,misfish,2014-12-27 19:28:00,29133,A bottle of pork rinds for a trailer and away you go !!!  Those are hard to find these days.  Nice find Mike.
888881,BillM,2014-12-27 22:08:00,17367,Very cool Mike!  You going to tie one on in June?
888904,solopaddler,2014-12-27 22:52:00,8605,Very cool Mike!  You going to tie one on in June?  Most likely bud. Wouldn't surprise me one bit though if we have to use soft plastics if the water is ultra cold which it very well could be. Depends on how the spring goes.
888936,BillM,2014-12-28 02:11:00,17367,I think I might bring a few dozen frozen smelt/herring
888940,msp,2014-12-28 03:04:00,1336,That's what I was thinking as well
889015,scuro2,2014-12-28 21:59:00,904,"I like the Johnston ones...fish them a lot for pike. They are the standard....but, for a good price you may have gotten yourself a great deal. I find they cheap out with finishes on some metal lures nowadays and rarely did so back then."
