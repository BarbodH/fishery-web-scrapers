888360,irishfield,2014-12-24 02:17:00,26272,Wonder how many dollars worth I ruined in the 60's early 70's. We had our own store from the time I was 4 years old... I use to open pack after pack of cards just to get the gum! lol Cards went in the bike spokes!
888369,fishing n autograph,2014-12-24 02:54:00,2540,Enough to pay for your retirement
888386,bigugli,2014-12-24 04:29:00,6138,"Nobody thought about collecting these things when we were kids. Just like nobody ever thought to keep the packages  that the toys came in. All the original matchbox toys i had that actually came in a matchbox are worth a fortune, but only if you never played with them. What's the point of having a toy you can't play with?"

888533,manitoubass2,2014-12-24 23:25:00,11391, I'm well aware of what I have and its all LOCKED UP!!!!  hahaha

888536,manitoubass2,2014-12-24 23:34:00,11391, seriously
888276,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-23 18:05:00,956,Hey guys.  Just like a lot of you I was always a sports card collector when I was younger.  I stuck with collecting mostly hockey cards.  I have a few stored away and was wondering what's the best way of getting rid of them to make a few dollars.  Looking to get maximum amount for every card.  I heard a good starting point is to send them to Beckett to get them graded then sell them.  Thanks
888279,fishing n autograph,2014-12-23 18:24:00,2540,"Well there's a couple of ways you can do it, but it all depends on what you have. Generally cards from 1989-1995 are worth pennies, even the big rookies from that era like Jagr are only worth $1. I would not waste money on grading those.  If you have stuff from the late 60s to 1988 then that's a different story because you'll most likely have the big cards. I would get those graded.  In terms of selling them, you won't get much If they are in the 1989-95 range. But If you have the high end stuff from 1960s-88 then I'd take them (if you can) to the national card show that's run at the international centre three times a year in Mississauga. I don't like using eBay because of the fees. You can also try collector message boards and forums.  Any questions let me know I'm a collector and can help you out"
888284,Acountdeleted,2014-12-23 19:34:00,2562,"Crud. Is that the same for baseball cards? Born in 84, I collected from 88 to probably 94. I had a bunch of good ones too, Pedro Martinez, Mike Piazza, Sammy Sosa. Worth nothing eh?"
888285,fishing n autograph,2014-12-23 19:41:00,2540,Baseball was even more mass produced from 1985-95 but there are some exceptions in there in terms of value but not a whole lot. The only valuable cards of the early 1990s is ken Griffey jrs 1989 upper deck and Derek Jeters 1993 rookie
888287,Acountdeleted,2014-12-23 19:51:00,2562,Did someone say Mo Vaughn and Ozzie Cansaco (not Jose..... Ozzie). Awww man. So I have a pile of cardboard.
888290,fishing n autograph,2014-12-23 20:01:00,2540,Lol there's a bit of a demand for those eras with autograph collectors. They buy the mass produced cards to get signed
888291,Acountdeleted,2014-12-23 20:06:00,2562,"The irony is, when I was a kid I thought my Magic the gathering cards would be worthless and I sold those two years ago for $1000. If I had started playing 2 years earlier I probably could have sold my collection for 10x that amount."
888292,fishing n autograph,2014-12-23 20:17:00,2540,"Lol that's the thing about cards, one minute they're hot and the next they're not"
888312,Fisherpete,2014-12-23 22:15:00,1814,Hey what's that Griffey Jr. Upper deck rookie card worth just out of curiosity? I actually have it.  Thanks Pete
888313,fishing n autograph,2014-12-23 22:18:00,2540,Goes for anywhere between $15 and $45
888314,misfish,2014-12-23 22:19:00,29133,I have this one and will keep it for as long as I can.  http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006GWW4GY/ref=asc_df_B006GWW4GY3464791/?tag=nextagmp-20&creative=395021&creativeASIN=B006GWW4GY&linkCode=df0&ascsubtag=-8285886624041027581

888317,Fisherpete,2014-12-23 22:27:00,1814,"Cool thanks, remember at one time it was worth quite a bit more than that"

888319,fishing n autograph,2014-12-23 22:28:00,2540,Ha when I first got it it was going for about $100-150 nmnt
888321,Fisherpete,2014-12-23 22:32:00,1814,"Yup, that's the price I remember - I should have sold then! Oh well.  I had 7 Brett Hull rookies at one point - sold 5 of them for $500 in the early 90's. Was big money for a 17 year old! I collected them all from packs too!"
888324,fishing n autograph,2014-12-23 22:39:00,2540,Now they are about $15-20
888327,kuhaman,2014-12-23 22:49:00,503,I wonder how many Gretzky rookie cards I wasted on my bike spokes LOL. Sold all my cards in the 90's when they were worth a lot! Got 600 bucks a piece for my 2 mint Gretzky rookie cards and sold the rest for about a grand( had a lot of cards)
888333,bigugli,2014-12-23 23:13:00,6138,"I used to have the old Opeechee NHL cards from the 60. Nothing in mint. We spent too much time shooting them against the wall as kids.  Still managed $500 for them some 10 years back, except for 1 card. It was a 69 checklist card. It was not mint, but it was unmarked. Was still worth $200 to a dealer"

888336,fishing n autograph,2014-12-23 23:20:00,2540,A friend of mine was renovating a house outside of Montreal and in the wall he found a bunch of shoe boxes full of momentos and photos. One of the boxes had a complete 1952 parkhurst set.... In pretty good condition and flipped it for a solid down payment on his house. That's like finding the holy grail of hockey cards
888339,bigugli,2014-12-23 23:29:00,6138,  10 card shootout. Each guy put up 10 cards against the wall. The guy to knock down the last card got the pile. There'd be 4-500 cards at stake In a good 4 man shootout.

888347,manitoubass2,2014-12-24 00:39:00,11391,you 's would be envious of my collection lol  Ive got almost every valuable card imaginable except...  no honus wagner haha  my favorite sets though are the war era baseball cards  only card ive ever sold over the years was on offer to good to resist on a michael jordan rookie card. payed a good chunk of my cousins wedding with that sale
888353,Freshtrax,2014-12-24 01:00:00,2215,out of curiosity how much are 13 boxes of 1991-1992 upperdeck hockey cards worth ? i found them in my attic.
