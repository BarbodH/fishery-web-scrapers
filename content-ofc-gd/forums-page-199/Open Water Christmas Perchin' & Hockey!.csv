All three of the kids are playing this year, and I’m coaching the beginners, which means 6-7 ice times per week!  Oh yeah, and we live 35 minutes from the arena..Claira was pumped to finally start at the ripe old age of 3. haha She’s far and away the smallest kid on the ice but is doing well and having a ton of fun.        Lukes finally had a chance to play some real games and is pumped about that.      And Averie is rocking’ it… she started 3 years late but is quickly catching up to the rest of the players.   She’s the only girl on her team and has no trouble keeping up with the boys.    We’ve even had a chance to catch some OHL action…          Onto some fishing.Averie and I tried to sneak in some late season action on the bay, but had some engine troubles and ended up stranded on the lake.  Lucky for us my wife’s cousins were just around the corner hunting and were able to tow us back to the marina.        After that we decided to pack up the boat and call it a soft water season.  Take it as a sign that it was over for the year.  After all, the marina had already started to freeze over shortly after.    Faster forward past far to many trips to the arena and it had now become Spring in December, with no ice to be seen for miles.… It was going to be a green Christmas in Port Rowan.      Averie and I took this as another sign… we should dig out the boat and hit up some late, late season perch.    After going back and forth on the idea of re-rigging the graph on the boat we finally opted to take the time to do it. ( we had taken it off and set it up for some ice fishing lol ) It’s a good thing we did because we ended up fishing schools of perch in 22-32 FOW.  We’d literally zig-zag around with the electric, with our baits out of the water until we found the school sitting right on bottom.  Then we’d quickly drop our baits right on their heads and BAM… fish on!  We even managed a couple of double headers.  It was a bit breezy so by the time we’d reel the fish up, take it off and re-rig we’d have blown 15-20 yards and have to start the process all over again.  It was like playing a video game, but worked well and was a heck of a fun way to cap off our 2014 soft water season.          The boat is officially put away until spring!    We wish you all the best in 2015!!!!  Cheers,  Ryan & family.  ps. GO CANADA GO! ( World Juniors )"
