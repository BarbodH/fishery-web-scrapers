888796,musky_hunter,2014-12-27 14:09:00,328,20lb leader is a little too strong. I've caught some huge smallies and pike on the Jbs with 12lb no issues.
888799,Lape0019,2014-12-27 14:38:00,647,Good to know!  Thanks!
888810,msp,2014-12-27 17:16:00,1336,That is my concern with the micro guides. I also use 50-100 pound flouro leaders for pike. I don't usually need the knot to go through the guides but every once in a while if a bait gets snagged I will reel up to the bait and use the Rod tip to free it
888813,msp,2014-12-27 17:24:00,1336,Just checked out the price of the megabass rods. $299 might be a little steep for me
888829,Steve,2014-12-27 18:42:00,2075,and not worth a penny when it comes to muskie or pike fishing...  the MB rod would be good for bass...not so much for pike or muskie. (or at least the size of line you mentioned above)
888831,Lape0019,2014-12-27 18:52:00,647,"I've caught a few pike on that rod without issues. Nothing to write home about but big enough to test the rod.  I should not I picked mine up for quite a bit less because the tackle shop wanted to blow out the Megabass rods. That wing said, I would buy another in a heartbeat. Although it states ""jerkbait special"" on it, it is quite a versatile rod that is worth a good look over. I don't beleive you will be dissapointed.  I would have preferred to buy a Dobyns but as stated, I could not find what I was looking for at that time. Looking back, I probably could have done quite well with a champion 683 (not a cb stick yet almost the same ratings as the xx) but you never know."
888832,Steve,2014-12-27 19:02:00,2075,"its not the catching of the fish that would be the issue, rather, what baits are being casted.  likely the jerk baits used for pike will be heavier than the standard vision 110's.  my concern would be overblowing the rod on the cast, not bringing in a 6-8lbs pike."
888833,Raf,2014-12-27 19:16:00,3495,"i cant think of a more versatile rod for bass and pike than a 7' mh.  mind you, pike and especially bass are a bit of an afterthought for me and i don't see a need for specialized gear in my case. but this style does everything i need it to, from husky jerks/xraps to spinner baits and #3-5 inlines"
888876,Lape0019,2014-12-27 22:04:00,647,That is understandable. The rod is rated for 3/4oz. The Dobyns that are being tossed around as ideas are about the same.
888939,msp,2014-12-28 02:57:00,1336,"All very good points so far. I have plenty of rods in the med heavy category. I have a couple of heavy action flipping sticks for throwing bigger pike style jerks in the 1-2 oz range. The Rod im looking for will be for bass style jerk baits like rogues, husky jerks ect..... I will have a look at the Dobyns rods soon. I have soft spot in my heart for shimano. So I'm really considering the new crucial"
888945,Ainsley,2014-12-28 03:37:00,142,"I, like quite a few here, use a dobyns 704cb graphite for jerkbaits."
888951,MCTFisher9120,2014-12-28 13:30:00,3761,"That is my concern with the micro guides. I also use 50-100 pound flouro leaders for pike. I don't usually need the knot to go through the guides but every once in a while if a bait gets snagged I will reel up to the bait and use the Rod tip to free it  I think you need 2 rods Mike, one for Bass(Smallies/Largies) on the jerk bait and a completely different setup for Pike and the heavy braid/leaders."

889025,msp,2014-12-28 23:32:00,1336,Says the salesman
889042,BillM,2014-12-29 01:13:00,17367,"I've got a 7ft Avid, m/h, fast action that I catch most of my pike on in the spring fishing jerkbaits.    It can double up as spinnerbait rod, topwater rod, whatever.  I've landed some giants on that stick (40in+), never under gunned.  If there was one rod I could have, that would probably be it."
889050,JoshS,2014-12-29 03:05:00,729,"I like my mh 6'6 v-rod for pike husky jerks, rogues etc. Been using it since it came out back in the day. Feels good. Mind you I've never tried a dobyn's or megabass. I have an old school crucial as well that's longer but I like the shorter stick for jerkbaits. If the new crucials are like the old ones that sounds like a good bet."
889051,msp,2014-12-29 03:27:00,1336,
889081,BillM,2014-12-29 16:01:00,17367,"I haven't had a chance to check out the new Avid-X models yet, but if it's a split grip rod it's not for me, lol."
889152,wkimwes,2014-12-29 19:05:00,76,The new Avid-X looks pretty sweet. Heard a lot of great things about the St. Croix rods Did you buy your rod yet?  I was just at Sail.  They had the previous Generation Crucial on clearance for 79.99.
889192,msp,2014-12-29 22:15:00,1336,I hated the foam split grip Still have a bit of time to pick out a rod. I'm going to check a few other models
889193,msp,2014-12-29 22:19:00,1336,I originally didn't like the split grip rods either. I have both but do prefer the full cork better. I'm used to the split grip now. What is your reason for not liking the split grips?
889216,BillM,2014-12-30 00:07:00,17367,"I originally didn't like the split grip rods either. I have both but do prefer the full cork better. I'm used to the split grip now. What is your reason for not liking the split grips?  They're ugly, and I like a full cork grip."
889240,Dan668,2014-12-30 01:12:00,1120,"I have two split grips, both nrx rods.  I prefer full cork 100%. Especially on the dobyns rods, balance is amazing,  something the previous shimano crucials lacked,  havent handled the current models though."
889357,Steve,2014-12-30 23:32:00,2075,"two handed casting (reaction baits, etc) is a pain in the butt with split grips.  all my nrx's are split grips (obviously), but otherwise I only use full cork rods.  if nrx's would release non split grip versions, I'd sell all my split grips and replace with full cork.  and nothing is worse than that eva foam crap."
889359,davey buoy,2014-12-30 23:46:00,5505,"I'm a cork fan as well,hate the foam split grip,cork all the way here  .Personal preference as most.."
888619,msp,2014-12-25 21:07:00,1336,Might be in the market for a new jerk bait rod. Looking for recommendations on a decent casting rod. I had a look at the loomis jb Rod and the St croix legend tournament jb Rod. Both really nice sticks around the same price point. Suggestions don't necessarily have to be high end like the ones mentioned. Just some suggestions and or recommendations. By the way some of my favourite rods that have stood the test of time are inexpensive lower end models. Oh yeah. I had a look at the new crucials. They look nice too
888624,Fisherpete,2014-12-25 23:01:00,1814,For muskies?
888626,mattaw,2014-12-25 23:22:00,162,"It really depends what you like. Some like a stiffer tip, others a more parabolic action. In the price range of the IMX jerkbait are the Megabass Orochi XX rods, they have a few options that work well for jerkbaits that cross that range. I have a few rods from that series and really like the feel of them."
888627,Lape0019,2014-12-25 23:26:00,647,Orochi xx jerkbait special is what I have. I do not like very parabolic rods and prefer something like a medium fast rod. The jerkbait special does a great job for me and it launches baits quite well for a 6'8 rod.
888629,Dan668,2014-12-25 23:58:00,1120,"I use a dobyns 704cb strictly for jerkbaits. Works great, the graphite model."
888630,msp,2014-12-26 01:19:00,1336,Mainly for bass and pike. I like a rod with a softer tip and a bit of backbone. More like a medium fast
888634,KraTToR,2014-12-26 01:55:00,506,"really any shortish <8', heavy rod will work.  Most Jerkbait applications come in the form of musky/pike or bass, which suits what you want.  The real issue is that Musky and Bass JB rods are very different and rod weight will only tell you part of the story.  For example, pick up a MH rod made for bass, then a MH rod made for pike/musky.  The bass rod will be rated for 12lb - 20lb test line, 1/4 oz to 1 oz lures. The pike/musky MH rod will be rated for 1/2 to 2 oz lures and 20 - 50lb line.  If you're truly looking for a one fits all, a 7' Heavy action bass type rod will fill both requirements.  I use a Bass Pro Extreme flippin' stick for casting, jerking, ripping, etc for pike. I spooled it with 40lb suffex braid.  Does the job plus I've got something that will pull bass out of heavy cover.    Good luck in your search!"
888640,Lape0019,2014-12-26 02:31:00,647,"Sounds like we have the same taste in jerkbait rods. If you can find a jerkbait special I. Your area, check it out and I doubt you will be dissapointed.i also use mine for walk the dog style baits and love it for that as well."
888646,msp,2014-12-26 05:45:00,1336,Sounds a little too heavy for my liking. I would think a 7' heavy would be overkill for bass.
888647,msp,2014-12-26 05:48:00,1336,
888654,buick14,2014-12-26 14:07:00,741,X2....for the price it's the best rod IMO.  I had a champion 684cb also and its an incredible stick.
888656,MCTFisher9120,2014-12-26 14:50:00,3761,"I use to use a Shimano Cumara it was 6'8"" Medium Ex-Fast, I throw my jerk baits on straight 10lb Reaction FC Fluorocarbon, big difference this year in casting distance after switching from FC Sniper to the FC Reaction, low memory and great strength.  Anyway, the Cumara was to stiff I bent hooks often. Mid summer I picked up the Megabass Orochi XX F4.5-68XX ""Jerkbait Special"" It's a 6'8"" Medium Power with a soft action they call ""Regular"" I consider it Moderate-Fast or Medium -Fast. On a 5+ It bent real deep in the rod on those 1-3lbr's it bends pretty good still. Hooks stopped bending out, casting distance improved. Very light rod and the way those XX's are built they are super strong.  If you throw the 110 Magnums/Ito-Shiner or just bigger jerk baits I was suggested to bump up to the Megabass Orochi XX F4.5-70XX ""Flatside Special"" Little bit longer little more power. Haven't fished it due to the length, I like doing erratic fast snaps and the longer rods don't work for me.  Good luck in your search. The 6'8 XX is my favourite I've found and it's forcing me to throw jerk baits more and more, just a pleasure to fish with all day long.  MTBF"
888657,Lape0019,2014-12-26 14:55:00,647,"I use almost all Dobyns rods but couldn't find what I was looking for when it came to jerkbaits. The 704cb was too long and the 684cb was too soft in the tip for me.  The rest of the Dobyns I have (champ 734, 735, 702sf, dx 743 and 745) are abslolutly great!  Warranty wise, you won't find one better IMO. Lifetime on manufacturing defects and a $70 no questions asked warranty for when it would not be covered under the lifetime. I smashed a rod tip in the rod locker and went to the store and picked up a new rod. I told him what happened and he handed me a new one anyway. It literally is a no questions asked warranty.  If you do want to use the manaufacturer defect warranty, you will have to pay to ship it to California, but that is it from what I recall. Great rod with great customer service at a pretty good price.  I don't think you will be disappointed if you go that route but maybe email or call Dobyns and ask what they would use. You will end up either talking to Gary or Richard Dobyns and you will see why their customer service is said to be great!  Adam"
888658,landry,2014-12-26 15:14:00,1005,"I have a 6'9"" carbonlite M spinning rod that is light and perfect for throwing jerkbaits IMO. No need to spend a ton of money on a jerkbait rod where feel is not as important as it is for other applications. Landry"
888659,Steve,2014-12-26 15:14:00,2075,"a little cheaper of an option, and it is a spinning rod (which makes jerk bait fishing all the more fun), I use a  G Loomis Bronzeback SMR751S-SP paired with a Shimano Stradic FH 1000F  It is only 6'3"", with a relatively fast tip, for a nice snap to the jerkbait."
888660,landry,2014-12-26 15:17:00,1005,I have lots of high end rods and the carbonlite are as sensitive as any out there. They are rumoured to break easily but I have three and they have been awesome. Plus they are $100. The guides are a light wire style but they have held up to braid just fine.
888668,Fisherpete,2014-12-26 15:56:00,1814,"For bass/pike jerkbaits I use a Rapala TS2 jerkbait rod - I think it is 6'7"" or 6'9"". Light and sensitive but has plenty of backbone. It is perfect for Xraps and such. Not expensive either, around $50. Not sure if they still make them though.  Pete"
888673,BillM,2014-12-26 16:19:00,17367,"I love my Dobyns 704CB Glass.  Combined with a Calais 100A, it's the setup I probably use 90% of the time for cranks and small topwaters.."
888675,Steve,2014-12-26 16:24:00,2075,that is a sweet crankbait setup Bill.  my fishing buddy uses the exact same one.
888733,msp,2014-12-26 23:00:00,1336,"I checked out the new St croix avid and the new crucials. Both 6 ft 8 medium action The avid was  $229 and had a much softer tip, micro guides and an overall nicer feel I'm not sure how I feel about the micro guides as I will be periodically using it in the winter The tip did seem a little bit too soft but a very nice rod The new crucial retails for $199. Not as soft of a tip but plenty of backbone  and a nice balance. The new models remind me of the older models from a few years ago. In my opinion a much nicer Rod than last years models ( black blank with split grip foam ) Both rods have split grip cork, which I like very much.  Can't stand the foam grip and will not even consider I will have the rest of the winter to look around. I will try to find a store that has the Dobyns rods to play with Any other recommendations or input would be appreciated"
888742,musky_hunter,2014-12-27 00:10:00,328,Tried them all and the Megabass XX jerkbait special is hard to beat. Like Mike said it's designed perfectly for the task.
888753,Lape0019,2014-12-27 01:28:00,647,"If you use leaders, you may have to learn some new knots. The jerkbait special has a little bit larger than micro guides and a uni to uni knot will not fit through them after a few casts. I have heard a modified Albright knot works well but I haven't tried and just used straight braid last year."
888760,musky_hunter,2014-12-27 02:13:00,328,I use the JBS with 20lb sx1 and 10-14lb sniper. I use Albright and no problems. I know 3-4 other people use uni to uni with the same rod and no issues.
888761,musky_hunter,2014-12-27 02:14:00,328,This year I ordered some Sunline Reaction FC to try with a CQ51.
888788,Lape0019,2014-12-27 13:17:00,647,I may have to try a smaller diameter line. I use 30lb pp and a 20lb seaguar leader. It fits through for a few casts and then swells to the point it just doesn't fit through the last few guides.
