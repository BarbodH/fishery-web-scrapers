888419,PBenson,2014-12-24 13:26:00,154,Are you sure that's for all piers? I know it's right for Naples pier but I didn't know every pier does that.
888421,BillM,2014-12-24 13:43:00,17367,"Are you sure that's for all piers? I know it's right for Naples pier but I didn't know every pier does that.  Piers are licensed, so you as the angler will not require an additional saltwater license."
888423,PBenson,2014-12-24 14:13:00,154,Cool good to know.
888593,Jds63,2014-12-25 16:50:00,1365,"Great job on the catch, and on the release ! Wow !"
888096,PBenson,2014-12-22 05:35:00,154,I usually come to Florida once or twice a year and this year I decided I was going to try and get into shark fishing. After spending a fortune picking up the required gear I hit the beaches for the past 7 days worth long hours with no luck. Finally today my reel started screaming. An hour and a half later a very big sandbar shark was landed!  
888097,Freshtrax,2014-12-22 05:57:00,2215,Well done!   Must have been a rush unhooking that beast.
888099,Musky or Specks,2014-12-22 06:39:00,2710,Very cool and now your part of everyone vacation story.
888102,limeyangler,2014-12-22 07:43:00,5204,"That is awesome!  Thanks Pbenson, loving the videos! Fishing the tropics is my absolute favourite! Thanks again for sharing!"
888105,Big Cliff,2014-12-22 10:35:00,6899,Very nice!!!!! I have caught a few while pier fishing in FL but nothing near that size.
888113,TDunn,2014-12-22 13:28:00,680,Awesome!!!!! Exactly the report I wanted to see!! I'm heading to daytona in two weeks for a week of the same! Any tips on surf fishing for shark would be appreciated!! Thanks for the video!!!  TDunn
888114,PBenson,2014-12-22 13:43:00,154,"I think the most important thing is to fish moving water and just like fresh water, structure. The particular spot I was in was a corner where the gulf connects to a pass. The other shore side was shallow so I figued any shark passing through with the tide is going to be close enough to smell it. Also the further your bait out the better, even though I didn't cast that bait particularly far for that shark. Other than that just maker sure you have big enough tackle. It might not look it in the video but my reel is huge. It has 500 yards of line on it."
888115,moxie,2014-12-22 13:59:00,1566,Florida fishing is one of the few bucket items on my list. Congratulations and thanks for sharing.
888125,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-22 15:28:00,956,Congrats
888142,SuperDave,2014-12-22 17:14:00,204,very cool. Nice job handling it too. Not sure I could unhook one of those.
888143,mepps,2014-12-22 17:14:00,1301,"Awesome, that a good size shark!"
888145,lookinforwalleye,2014-12-22 17:40:00,4399,Cool video....you drew quite a crowd!!!
888146,Acountdeleted,2014-12-22 17:48:00,2562,Wow. Great fish. And you became a bit of a local celebrity with the size of that crowd.
888149,OhioFisherman,2014-12-22 18:01:00,6623,"Cool! Now a thought or few, it seems that there is some debate in Florida about shark fishing from beaches?  http://www.trackingsharks.com/win-sharks-delray-beach-restricts-shark-fishing/  https://newsela.com/articles/shark-catches/id/3976/  http://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/local/environment/sharks/2014/10/15/melbourne-beach-weighs-shark-fishing-chumming-ban/17307795/  http://traveltips.usatoday.com/florida-rules-shark-fishing-63019.html  Just from my very limited experience there, along some sections of the gulf coast the towns seem to have been set up to get a portion on the tourist dollars, they can change names every mile or so of the shore. Knowing the regulations in the particular area might be very important? I can't recall seeing a sign on the beach letting you know when you had crossed into a different towns jurisdiction.    Big fish?"
888158,manjo39,2014-12-22 19:13:00,354,Anyone go for swim after that?
888208,PBenson,2014-12-23 00:58:00,154,"Funny, I think I was the only one in the water after that."
888231,solopaddler,2014-12-23 03:54:00,8605,"Very cool, your excitement was obvious. Congrat's on the catch!"
888240,manitoubass2,2014-12-23 05:17:00,11391,wow you handled that much better then i would  awesome job and great catch!
888255,PBenson,2014-12-23 12:50:00,154,Thanks guys
888258,TDunn,2014-12-23 13:30:00,680,"Thx for the info man. Might hit ya with a pm if I have any more questions if you don't mind. Again, awesome shark  TDunn"
888297,spincast,2014-12-23 20:55:00,3279,nice catch! what a blast. Florida game fishing is on the must-do-soon-list
888308,Big Cliff,2014-12-23 22:08:00,6899,"Peir fishing can be a blast and not expensive. Go to BPS and for $50.00 you can buy a rod, reel, and some tackle. Get some shrimp or squid and head for the local pier.  I have caught so many different things and made so many good friends that way!"
888330,bassfighter,2014-12-23 23:03:00,366,Does a person have to buy surf fishing license to fish Florida?  Fresh and Saltwater are two different license alone.
888393,PBenson,2014-12-24 06:13:00,154,No a saltwater liscence covers the surf.
888397,Big Cliff,2014-12-24 08:33:00,6899,If you are fishing a pier you do not need a license
