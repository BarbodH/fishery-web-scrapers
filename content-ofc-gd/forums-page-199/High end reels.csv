Only time I've ever had a problem with a shimano reel that wasn't abuse/excessive use related.  Even their lower priced stuff is pretty durable!  I have landed a couple of smaller Muskie on a stradic ci4 1000 series while pickerel fishing, and boy that reel is pretty smooth.  Then again, I've landed dozens of incidental Muskie over 20 years on a diawa ss700 during spring pickerel opening, so I would expect at least as much from the stradic!"
888217,MCTFisher9120,2014-12-23 02:30:00,3761,"I love high end gear. It is made with the best materials and parts and you rarely have issues with it. As another guy mentioned once you have fished with a high end rod like a G.Loomis NRX you will find it hard to justify spending $100 on a rod to flip jigs with. When you consider the higher end rods are half the weight 2x the sensitivity and just feel better in your hand all day long it pays for it's self. I get to fish 20-40 days a year and I'll be dammed if I let crappy equipment stop me from making 1000 perfect casts each day, I don't want a gear to slip, i want the drag to be perfect and i don't like fatigue. Lighter reels and balanced setups are more comfortable in your hand and let you focus on fishing rather than that 10oz reel and 6oz rod making your wrist soar after a 10hr day on the lake.  It's no different with any other thing in this world. A high end lure is usually airbrushed, uses good quality hooks and split rings an won't rust when wet or fall apart easily. It's no different with rods and reels in you get what you pay for. I've burnt through reels before, $100 spinning and bait casters. If you consider the 3 or 4 reels you might burn out over 10 or 15 years vs the 1 Stradic or Stella you might buy and have last the same time you really aren't paying more in the end. The question is are you a weekend warrior or passionate serious fisherman who gets out for a few weeks each season. I learned quick when you have a opportunity to grab something high end on sale do it! I've grown so much as a angler the last 5 or 6 years and the better equipment has helped me catch more and learn more about fishing. Reels made in Japan are a hit in my books. Quality and refinement is much better.  MTBF"

888220,Fish Farmer,2014-12-23 02:32:00,2234,"Fish Farmer. The reason your anti reverse quits in the cold may be because the oil or grease is too thick or there is too much in the bearing. Clean the anti reverse bearing. All it is is some roller bearings in a plastic or metal race that drop into a position that basically jams the handle to keep it from turning. If the lube is too thick when it is cold, it will prevent this from happening. You don't even need to lubricate this bearing if you don't want to. Not hard to get to and clean. Hope this helps. Thanks for the reply Larry. I've tried a few times lucubrating with light machine oil, 3in1 electric motor oil. Next time I may as you say wash, dry, and no oil. But just the thought of no oil makes me think it will wear out, but I'll give it a try."

You'll be just fine.  A little maintenance goes a long way."

I would however recommend stepping up to the Symetre though since it has a few extra features for not a whole lot more.  X-ship alone (a bearing supported pinion gear) will add to how long the reel lasts because it helps keep everything alignment while under a large load."

High end too but at what cost to manufacture?  Mark-up on fishing stuff in general is over-the-top for what it is and costs to produce, and most of us know that.  Fished alongside many guys with better rods and reels than my own, and the end results had pretty well nothing to do with our differences in gear."

But before I bought any high end gear I started with the cheapest walmart combos, moved to middle range, then to high end gear.  To be honest, I prefer rods like the Clarus etc, $70-100 range.  For reels I buy one gem I found 5 years ago and with a cleaning each season they hold up and are just awesome cheap reels. The Okuma Avenger in the 20 and 30 series. Very durable and great smooth drags. No ploblems even handling big stugeon. There on all my kids rods, a few of mine and all my ice rods. I own probably 10 of them and none have had an issue. Can't beat the $40 price tag either?"

I throw a lot of hardware for steelhead as well, and you're right it's hard on reels. Been using a Stradic CI4 4000 for two seasons now and so far it's rock solid. Even though it's a bigger reel it still weighs only 9oz and balances perfectly on my rods. Larger spool is a big aid in casting as well.  Daiwa Tournament reels are old technology but still have one of the best drags on the market. It's not a bad choice but don't get the 1600, it's montrously huge and heavy. Get the 1300."

The newer reel with Instant Anit-Reverse kept fish on the hook. At least three nice Largies this summer, hit with my rod in the wrong position for hookset. With the new reel and the X-ship, quick snap of the wrist and set, my old reel would've taken a long sweep before the anti reverse kicked in.  The Saros is a gorgeous reel for the price. $169 puts it in the middle and its def worth it"

My problem was the 4000 sized reel's drags died during the first season. Shimano replaced them without issue, but not just one, but both Ci4 4000 drags....but again, that is due to SALMON (all other species I've caught from trout to bass to pike etc were fine).  The sustain reel is hands down better than the Ci4, but, of course costs another $100 on top of the Ci4 price.  I just picked up a used Stella for $325.....used can often be the way to go."

887959,sauce,2014-12-21 03:58:00,219,"Shimano makes quite a range of reels. The more you spend, the more abuse your gear can take. I've wrecked Saharas using braid. My stradics have held up to abuse for several seasons. If you're using mono or light braid with loose drag you can probably get away with cheaper gear.  Not saying a cheaper reel won't do the trick. I believe the higher end gear is made to last. Smooth on day 1 still smooth on day 1000"
887961,Paudash,2014-12-21 04:40:00,273,"funny comment on the braid destroying the reel, I switched to braid 2 years ago and burnt through a few reels this year.  Is this common as this is the first I I have heard of it"
887963,porkpie,2014-12-21 05:16:00,2521,"Nothing wrong with Saharas.  Really it's what you can afford that gets the job done without having to constantly replace cheap inferior equipment.  There is a balance point for that, and a Sahara is probably it. Perhaps the symetre, if you need to pick a spot in the product line.  When I was young I bought cheap, noticed that things broke, and I had to replace them often.  I got smart , bought the best I could afford, which was middle road stuff that performed well without constantly breaking.  When I got a bit older, I found suddenly I could afford a bit more of the high end stuff, so I bought some, and I probably didn't need to, but I wanted to so why not.  Anyway, the message is buy the best you can afford, and if it works for you stick with it.  If you eventually want the high end stuff, and you get to the point where it's no longer a budget killer to have a few nice toys, then fill your boots!  You probably don't need it, but you only live once!"
887966,Freshtrax,2014-12-21 06:59:00,2215,"I  guess if is a feel thing  i am doing ok.  My spinning reels only get used for pike walleye, perch  and bass.     I doubt i will regret my love of Sahara's unless i hook a trophy pike.   I totally  get the buy the best attitude but i just bought my first house this summer and am saving for a great lakes boat.   I would rather have 3 Saharas's  in the boat and not have to tie lures than one one Stradic in the hand I guess."
887969,ecmilley,2014-12-21 11:08:00,2163,I have the bottom to top in shimano. A stella makes a stradic feel cheap let alone symmetry s or saharas better bearings better drag. Well balanced are all factors. Until you have the chanc to use them  you wont notice the difference same goes for rods

However when I started out I had some more expensive...not top of the line... gear because I fish other species as well. All my expensive gear has crapped out except for my old reliable 1300 whisker diawa reel that is bulletproof.  I have had good luck with all my Diawa reels so I have a bunch of medium/low end models now that do the trick for me. I just can't justify to myself spending more for the type of fishing I do."
887983,lew,2014-12-21 14:38:00,12766,Always liked the Calcutta CT baitcast series for muskies until I I started using the TE series and there's no comparison. I still have rods rigged with CT but 90 % of my casting is TE.  All a personal choice though.
887986,landry,2014-12-21 15:09:00,1005,For pulling musky baits - high end reels DO make a huge difference. For bass and spinning reels - it doesn't matter IMO. I have found the shimano Citicard to be good bass baitcasters
887987,Lape0019,2014-12-21 15:10:00,647,"Freshtrax,  I've used a Pflueger president and the. Switched to a Stradic CI4 and then promptly bought a second one because I was that impressed. The difference between the two was night and day.  As stated above, everything is built with better components which translates to more refinement. Also, until you hit the Stella, the reels are typically lighter.  The stradic is worth the money IMO but I find there is still a cut off. I don't know if I would spend more for a Sustain because I don't find there is a big enough difference.  The same couldbe said on the baitcast line as well. I have shimano baitcasters from $200 - $500 and there are noticeable differences. The Curado is a workhorse and does an excellent job (I have an e and an i) but if you step up to the ci4+ Chronarch, you will notice some refinement with better bearing and drag being used. The core is in a league of it's own and feels so smooth considering it has less bearings than the other reels mentioned. My Metanium on the other hand is not worth the extra money to me.  It's level of refinement over the ci4+ chronarch is not enough to justify the added cost because of the way I use it. I have heard that the met really shines with 1/4oz baits which isn't what I bought it for. If I used it for that, I would probably have a different feeling towards it.  The more you spend, the newer the technology is as well. X-ship was only offered in the high end reels for the first year and trickled down a few years later.  Needless to say, I beleive there are a few advantages to buying higher end gear but in the end, it comes down to personal preference and comfort level for what you are willing to spend.  Adam"

888039,Lape0019,2014-12-21 22:33:00,647,"Before this goes crazy. Higher priced reels won't help you catch fish but they do provide me with an enjoyability that I just don't find in cheaper gear. Higher prices rods in the other hand, may help you detect the more subtle bites.  If your budget doesn't allow for you to buy three stradics and you really want three combo's, go cheaper and get the functionality you are looking for.  I myself, usually buy one combo a year. I started out with one good one and built up from there. I have sold off a few that didn't provide me with what I was working for and bought better stuff over the years and it has worked out well for me.  Currently, I am running all shimano reels and mostly Dobyns rods and don't plan on getting rid of any. In fact, I sold off a lew's, pflueger and abu last year to buy more shimano reels.

A lot of the time I spend on the water, I'm actually casting, and fishing through areas. I find nicer (higher priced) gear puts a smile on my face through the whole time on the water. I like being able to feel ever little rock and weed. There is a performance boost, but is it worth spending that much? That I can't answer, it's a personal choice. I have caught fish on the cheap Canadian Tire combos my dad bought me as a kid and on my more expensive bass gear later on in life. I promise you, the fish aren't jumping into your boat going, it feels so good to be caught on x,y or z. The gear that makes you happy, is the gear you should be using."
