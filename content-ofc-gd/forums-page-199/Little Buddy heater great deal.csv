888823,Fisherpete,2014-12-27 17:48:00,1814,"Wow, great deal"
888824,misfish,2014-12-27 18:20:00,29133,"Yup,but you might find it,s not warm enough on those real cold days.  Did you get one of those thermo huts? If so then you should be ok."
888880,Mr.Topwater!,2014-12-27 22:07:00,81,I have the thermal commando. I'm gonna rig up a small fan for the roof. That and lots of merino wool should keep me toasty.
888924,Fisherman,2014-12-28 00:37:00,7201,Hope that merino wool has been processed.
888943,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-28 03:15:00,956,Have been using one for the last couple of years and had no problems.  Only one day out of several dozen where it was too cold that I had to leave.  I have a four man tent that I use it in.  Just a whine starting it sometimes.
