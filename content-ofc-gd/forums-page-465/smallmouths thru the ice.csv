642912,Rizzo,2011-11-25 14:52:00,4754,try a search on this board. I seem to recall someone last year or the year before posting all kinds of smallies through the ice

642927,mike rousseau,2011-11-25 15:50:00,4661,we got 25 one day when we were trying to learn how to get lakers...  they really like the old hook and minnow set up as well as williams woblers gold and silver half and half hammered finish... about 3 inch spoon with 3 inch shinners  they were positioned on the biggest hump on the lake...  the hump topped out around 18-20 feet... the bass were in 20-25... no deeper...

642952,jeffw,2011-11-25 17:14:00,267,"got a monster smallie and afew others off a deep guns while fishing for lakers near minden last year. They were crushing buckshot spoons tipped with a 4"" shiner. We Were deadsticking."
642995,cheaptackle,2011-11-25 20:40:00,849,I never tried for bass thru the ice simply because I always thought there's no winter season for them in Ontario.  Am I wrong?  Michael
643010,manitoubass2,2011-11-25 21:17:00,11391," largies and smallies are open all year where I live (rainy river, zone 5)  I've tried numerous times to fish smallies through the ice, and it's really, really tough (at least for me, lol). When I can get on them it's fun though! But for everytime I target them and do well, theres another day I get skunked.  I've had numerous baits work, but I find deadsticking to be the most productive approach   "
643024,trapshooter,2011-11-25 21:43:00,1234,"They are open all year long across a large part of NW Ontario.  I've caught them out of 25-35 fow on Lindy Darters, jigs/minnows.  I'd bet that all types of ice jigging baits would get em, once you find them.  "
643040,cheaptackle,2011-11-25 22:26:00,849,"That splains it!  I've never fished NW Ontario - Couple hours ""perchin"" in North Bay is as far north as I've been.  Must be quite the battle getting them thru a hole!  Michael"
643068,Jer,2011-11-25 23:36:00,1426,"Although not smallies, and out of season to boot. With the new Kawartha winter panfish season, we have caught a surprising number of good sized largies the last couple years.  Best one had to be over 5lbs caught by my buddy on Buckhorn (sorry for the OOS pic), he's almost 300lbs, so the fish looks a bit smaller:    We certainly have never been targetting them, but they don't seem to be shy of a panfish bait."
643419,Beans,2011-11-27 15:30:00,3339,I've never caught bass thru the ice but I'd imagine they would hit a salted tube...
643421,uglyfish,2011-11-27 15:34:00,981,"I've caught a few largies ice fishing in hamilton harbour and some of the conservation areas around. They always hit tiny crappie jigs, but are not aggressive at all when doing so. Seen smallies caught in binbrook throught the ice quite often."
643428,FinS,2011-11-27 16:02:00,463,thanks for the input guys great community here
