642978,Familyfisherman,2011-11-25 19:37:00,188,"Headed out with a friend and my dad this morning -- about 7am start.  Took 20 minutes or so trying to figure them out -- slow start...till my dad left his spoon flat on bottom for about 10 seconds to tie his shoe, then...    John picked up on this ""do nothing approach"", and a couple minutes later...    His fish was tagged, #5438...  I finally caught on...eventually    Angelic shot I thought...   We ended up with 7 fish, top 5 might've been 21-22lbs, no giants.  We were in by 10am...very nice day out there.  Good luck to those heading out tomorrow...go early, bite dies fast..."
