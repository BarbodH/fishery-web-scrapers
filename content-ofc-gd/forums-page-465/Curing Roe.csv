643076,spinnerdoc,2011-11-25 23:54:00,556,"I HAVE HEARD OF THIS TRICK BUT WAS NOT SURE HOW TO DO IT, THE LADY WHO TOLD ME ABOUT THIS USED THIS METHOD IN HER MASON JARS FOR PICKLES. DO YOU LIGHT IT UP INSIDE THE JAR AND CLOSE IT, OR YOU CLOSE THE JAR AND LIGHT IT UP AND PUT IT ON TOP?"
643080,misfish,2011-11-26 00:00:00,29133,  You lost me with all the SHOUTING.
643161,SirCranksalot,2011-11-26 04:16:00,3291,in   Sounds interesting. Have you used that 'trick' lately? How do you apply the wax?
643167,dave524,2011-11-26 04:40:00,4508," You light it and drop it in the jar while still lit quickly put the lid on while still burning, it will burn until the oxygen is all used up and go out. If done correctly when the air inside the jar cools the lid will snap and seal with an audible snap and seal . No oxygen = no spoilage"
643178,misfish,2011-11-26 10:21:00,29133,  You melt the wax and add the rest. Do this outside though. STINKY
643197,spinnerdoc,2011-11-26 12:47:00,556,ha ha I wasn't shouting Brian
643200,spinnerdoc,2011-11-26 12:48:00,556,So thats how you do it....Thanks guys
643211,dave524,2011-11-26 13:31:00,4508,"This guy was a prolific writer on steelheading back in the 70's and the first place I heard of sponge vaseline balls many years ago, haven't touched sponge since yarn became popular with all the pretty colours in the 80's, lot less hassle  FWIW here is a link for making sponge balls straight from the original horses mouth.  http://record-eagle.com/daverichey/x75049104/Dave-Richey-Vaseline-balls-for-steelhead"
643213,Crazy Ivan,2011-11-26 13:52:00,184,"Another version -  In a baby food jar partly filled with roe, take a wooden or paper match and place it in the roe so it stands up by itself (head up of course). Light the head of the match and screw the lid on before it goes out. When done correctly, you'll hear a pop the next time it's opened."
643216,Ralph Field,2011-11-26 14:00:00,1018,I tried the sponge balls years ago and almost set fire to our kitchen while melting the vasolene. After enduring my wife's wrath I didn't catch anything on them.
643237,misfish,2011-11-26 15:43:00,29133,"I am corrected,it was vasolene not wax."
643238,misfish,2011-11-26 15:46:00,29133," Lots of good reading there Dave,Thanks for the link."
643283,SirCranksalot,2011-11-26 22:21:00,3291, Interesting read. But I think he meant open cell foam rather than closed cell: closed cell won't soak up anything.
643284,BillM,2011-11-26 22:38:00,17367,You guys make this way more complicated than it actually is.
643305,dave524,2011-11-27 00:26:00,4508," Correct Bill, we used open cell and it took a lot of searching in the housewares depts.to get the right stuff, a shiny translucent foam worked way better than the more dull opaque stuff. Never went to the extreme of vaseline impregnating it, just ran balls of foam maybe some sent and like I said when yarn came out it was abandoned."
643474,Sinker,2011-11-27 19:48:00,8692,"The key to it keeping is no air, and as little moisture as possible. Period.  I use the same method as Bill.  Another tip is to freeze them in the ziplocks in a single layer of eggs. This way they stack nice in a tupperware container, and when you take them out, they thaw a little quicker for those days your in a rush.  No cure for me, just straight fresh roe.  I scrape skien, and leave it in a strainer, with a sheet of paper towel on top, in the fridge over night. Most of the juice will fall thru the strainer into a bowl. Dry eggs keep for a long time. The moisture causes frost in the bags, and thats what kills the eggs.  BTW, I haven't drifted a trib for many, many years, but this is how we did it in the late 80's-90's, when there were more fish than fisherman!!  S."
642744,cjgraham,2011-11-24 22:57:00,104,Well I'm about to throw my roe in the freezer for the winter. This is essentially the first year I have done this. Anyone have any special ways of preserving their eggs? tin foil over zip lock? shake and cure over borax?
642759,BillM,2011-11-24 23:50:00,17367,No need to cure them.  Do you have a vacuum pack machine?  If not do this...  Store about 1 days fishing worth of roe in a ziplock bag.  Suck out the excess air with a straw.. Store all those smaller separate bags in a bigger ziplock..  Use the straw trick with that big bag as well.  What this does is only allow you to defrost as much roe as you need.  Need to tie some bags?  Remove one of the smaller ziplocks and defrost only that..  No point in defrosting then refreezing all your roe because you gotta tie up 20-30bags for a day of fishing.
642760,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-24 23:59:00,0,uncured will definitely often outfish cured lots of times  but i use salt and brown sugar and i don't freeze them typically.
642761,misfish,2011-11-25 00:02:00,29133," Bill was nice enough to give me two bags this spring and I have to say,they have kept well. I am able to break off just what I need and put the rest back.     That is my fav cure DR. I have yet to do it this year.No need."
642770,cjgraham,2011-11-25 00:31:00,104, Thats a great idea. thanks for that   Dr. Sal how long does that last in the fridge?
642775,spinnerdoc,2011-11-25 00:43:00,556,"So Bill, you put the roe as is, nothing added? I did what you described for the first time and have not tried them yet"
642777,BillM,2011-11-25 00:47:00,17367,"Yup, I make sure there's no blood or crap on them, then dry them on a baking sheet until they are a bit tacky.  Then seal and freeze them.  I add nothing at all.  I know a lot of guys that do cure, I think it's all personal preference."
642784,spinnerdoc,2011-11-25 00:53:00,556,Oh crap I kept the skein in
642789,misfish,2011-11-25 01:00:00,29133," Hey Spin.  If you got skein,I use to use egg cartons to portion the bits.They seemed to last in the freezer for some reason.Not sure if it,s the material the egg cartons are made of,but it worked."
642790,BillM,2011-11-25 01:02:00,17367, Jam bags are good!  Don't worry about it.  Giant stinky nasty bombs are awesome in cold/dirty water situations.
642819,Eazy,2011-11-25 02:10:00,260,"I typically use pro-cure, you can get it at western tire chris."
642932,spinnerdoc,2011-11-25 16:05:00,556,"I took some out and they are sticky like crazy. I tried tying then in roe bags and i had ti wear gloves, they are jammy alright."
642933,spinnerdoc,2011-11-25 16:07:00,556,I'll keep that in mind I don't have that much to store. You just put em in there no saran wrap of anything?
642942,kemper,2011-11-25 16:47:00,2232,"For skein: scrape, dry, sprinkle of borax, sometimes I add a pinch of orange jello powder for colour (and for whatever reason they seem to come out of the freezer better with the jello, sugar might have something to do with it)  Less is better of everything!  For loose: I like to river cure them, and tie bags with nice marbles for clear water situations. Works well for me, others hate it."
642943,misfish,2011-11-25 16:53:00,29133," Yep,the dozen/eighteen cartons,not the flats."
642967,spinnerdoc,2011-11-25 18:24:00,556,Gotcha Brian
642968,fishindevil,2011-11-25 18:29:00,6254,"i have also used pro-cure with a few drops of different color  dye from luhr jensen,as well as a dash of borax,pickling salt too,and if i have had leftover minnows i will grind them up minus the heads and guts and make a brine like solution and when i am going fishing i will dip the roe bags in the brine juice its deadly ,has caught me tons"
642970,misfish,2011-11-25 18:43:00,29133," To add,I have never tied bags with skein eggs. I tie a slip knot on the hook .Pull it down the shank,pull out a loop,feed hahf the skein through,pull tight and weave the rest onto the hook letting some dangle.I can tell you this is killer."
642980,spinnerdoc,2011-11-25 19:50:00,556,"I've tried the egg loop but have never fished skein, does the egg fall off? The ones I have are starting to come apart so I think it's I'd have to scrape it. I dunno I'm too delicate with it, actually, i didn't want to loose eggs so i tied then in roe bags.. A buddy of mine gave me some salmon roe last fall and I just finished it this year and this one had some skein on, I tied them with skein on and it worked but I do however wanna try what you suggested, I can see why it is deadly, with all the color and smell to it, I would think it would be hard to resist."
642982,misfish,2011-11-25 19:53:00,29133," It has to be the early stuff (tight),if you can scrape it,thats best."
642989,spinnerdoc,2011-11-25 20:26:00,556,"Yeah i think what i have is at the later stage. thanks brian for the tips and sorry for getting a little off topic folks.Didn't mean to hijack this one, with that said peace..out."
642991,misfish,2011-11-25 20:32:00,29133,"I dont think it,s off topic.It,s roe related."
643002,dave524,2011-11-25 21:04:00,4508,"I treat water hardened eggs with a boric acid solution, about a tablespoon to a quart of water, let dry without rinsing and store in bags or glass with air removed. They will keep months this way with just refridgeration. Boric acid is a non toxic antiseptic, fungicide and preservative that is used to treat everything from an eye wash to yeast infections and preserve everything from milk to urine samples, guess it works cause the eggs are sterile and free from nasties that will cause them to go bad when treated this way ."
643026,misfish,2011-11-25 21:45:00,29133,"  Wow, theres some old school.And if I may add a trick to getting the air out. I did the same as Dave,Gerber jars. I would put a piece of wax paper in it and light it on fire and close the lid. A trick that was shown to me by an ole timer."
643034,misfish,2011-11-25 22:05:00,29133,"For some of those that might have tried this,did you?  Back in the early 80,s I read an artical about soaking small pieces of sponge, in ,cod liver oil and aness and wax.Spelt wrong I know.I did this and it worked for me. I would clip away and make it look like a roe bag. Just asking."
