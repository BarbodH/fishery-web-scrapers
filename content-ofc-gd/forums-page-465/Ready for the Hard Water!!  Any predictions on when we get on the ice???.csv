643467,Fishmaster,2011-11-27 19:14:00,920,We fished the Lower Grand River last year on Dec 20th for Walleye ...hope this season is cold and better fishing ...and no smelt around
642830,Waterfowlr,2011-11-25 02:33:00,19,"Hey Guys and Girls  Anybody else ready for some Ice fishing??  I gotta say, I am so ready for it.  This time of year is great for the hunting..but I do really enjoy some ice fishing.  Just talking with a buddy...we were throwing out dates we thought we might have ice.  We are near Simcoe...but always like to get around different areas!  My prediction this year is that we will be able to get out on some of the smaller bodies on Dec. 23rd.  Simcoe I say Dec 29th in Cooks!  Gotta love first ice!!  Anyone else got a guess!"
642901,Rod Caster,2011-11-25 14:25:00,5784,"I'd be happy if Nipissing were safe by Jan 1st. At this point, it doesn't look likely."
642904,alexmedic,2011-11-25 14:36:00,186,"I walked on 3"" of black last Christmas Eve.  That was in Gilford"
642908,Rizzo,2011-11-25 14:46:00,4754,"I've ice fished at our cottage near Parry Sound regularly around Dec 15, but I think we'll be a bit behind that this year. Dec 27 for Cooks Bay"
642929,mike rousseau,2011-11-25 15:54:00,4661,last year my shack was on the ice on dec 24th... 8-10 inches...  normally get out dec 15th or so...  most years im in my boat and guys are starting to ice fish... so i have no gap in fishing...
642934,BillM,2011-11-25 16:09:00,17367,Way too much steelheading to be done to be thinking of ice fishing just yet!
643017,Jer,2011-11-25 21:25:00,1426,"Last year, Christmas Day was our first venture onto the ice on Buckhorn, walking of course. Musta been about 2 weeks after that we were driving on Chemong.  It doesn't take long once we get a stretch of cold weather."
643037,fishermccann,2011-11-25 22:14:00,655,My first day fishing on ice last year was Dec. 16th. on Frenchmans Bay.
643039,misfish,2011-11-25 22:18:00,29133,"When I see a path,I,ll be there. I was one to be the first,but I get up later now.HA HA HA"
643043,bigugli,2011-11-25 22:31:00,6138,We were on Couch the 27th lasy year. This warm trend will hold the line a little later.
643049,chris.brock,2011-11-25 22:41:00,4053,"it felt like summer this afternoon, I read in the paper today, Scandanavia is warm and without snow, they are complaining about no snow for skiing I remember one year in the late 80's, it was this weekend (last in Nov) and we were snowmobiling on 8 inches of clear ice and a foot of powder snow on a smaller lake (Haliburton County), weather is variable but I think we are feeling some of the affects of global warming"
643050,misfish,2011-11-25 22:44:00,29133," Dought it Bruce.Couch is always good to go before the new year. Theres a local lake near there, I fish now on new years day."

643057,Big Cliff,2011-11-25 22:56:00,6899,"I predict ice in about 3 minutes and 27 seconds. Just long enough to finish typing this and get to the fridge with a nice shot of rye. Oh wait, you were talking about ice to walk on! Sorry! I guess this doesn't count!"
643061,misfish,2011-11-25 23:13:00,29133,"  Ha ha ha, were on the same page.LMAO Cliff."
643108,GBW,2011-11-26 00:46:00,8460,"I guess my folks lake will be dec 19 for it to have a GOOD layer of ice.  not just a frost.  but if the wind keeps going the way it is then the 24th.  I'll be there on new years eve and with luck, perching while I'm there..."
643120,Ron,2011-11-26 01:28:00,1683,Last day Muskie fishing last year was Dec 15th. First day Ice fishing last year was Dec 16th. The scary part??? They were both on Rice Lake!
643122,crappieperchhunter,2011-11-26 01:43:00,2582,I will be icing perch either on Coooch or Simcoe Dec 17/18 weekend....possibly Dec 10/11  That's been the norm for over 10 years now. Don't see that changing.  Christmas week I'm always on my 3rd 4th or 5th trip out. Last year Cooch had 7 plus inches of ice by Christmas.
643124,crappieperchhunter,2011-11-26 01:47:00,2582, Sounds like my last ice fishing Ron. I have been walking on the ice on Simcoe  on a Saturday and on another part of the lake the next day in my boat.  A perfect spring weekend is Simcoe ice in the am...eastern trib rainbows in the afternoon...and then out in the boat on Simcoe the following day  :thumbsup_anim:
643136,Leecher,2011-11-26 02:25:00,7832, You bet    And square tails are first on the menu to start
643168,Remastered,2011-11-26 04:56:00,143,"Yeah, too much steelheading to be done. I'll worry about the ice when the weather actually gets icy. But I won't lie, I think of it every now and then"
643227,bucktail,2011-11-26 15:00:00,1857,"I think christmas, but I think it's going to freeze hard and fast. Alot of -45 in the yukon and NWT these last 2 weeks, setting records. When it launches south we are in for a workld of hurt if your near the wramer great lakes this season"
643230,esoxansteel,2011-11-26 15:04:00,1307,"Still musky fishing open water, and hope it stays that way till Dec 15"
643257,Joeytier,2011-11-26 19:15:00,3990,I was on Quinte december 17 or 18 last year.  Hopefully i can match that again this year.  Less than a month away with any luck!!
