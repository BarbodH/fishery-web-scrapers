I was going to make it a blast and cast day (hunt in the am and fish in the pm) but with over 25 days spent together in the field this season like an old married couple it was time for myself and the dog to have some ""ME"" time LOL so the Shorthaired Pointer was left at home. This was my Fourth time on the river this year as most of my attention has been focused on hunting. I arrived at the rivers edge first thing in the AM and was greeted by two others already there, they quickly raised their white flags and bolted.... I hope to see those deer again before Dec 31st. Fishing was great with over a dozen fish for the day. No tanks but all were between 3-6lbs which was good enough to keep it interesting. All fish came on roe bags and seemed to prefer the tail outs of the usual runs. If your headed out Tomorrow it should be good   "
643137,ChrisK,2011-11-26 02:28:00,2772,Well done JOP. I'll take 3 to 6 pounders all day if thats what was in the cards. Good scrappers to say the least !!
