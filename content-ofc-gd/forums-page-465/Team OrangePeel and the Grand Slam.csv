Trolled   for another 7 hours and boated 1 for 3. One of those misses buried the   board and straighten the back hook out on the Reef Runner. So we ended   the day 6 for 8. As soon as it got enough light we changed up to 2, 2 1/2, 5 & 7 cores.  Speed was 1.9 to 2.05 today.  Hot lure of the day that took 3 walleye.   A few pics of the day, with some of the better lures.      Our captain for the weekend aboard the Grand Slam.     Here is the pic of the last sat fish.    This fish engulfed the lure and had to be kept.  Sunday was another day. Along with the joy of fishing with Al, we had Don on the Slam. Or was it Don with Al on the Slam.  Same lures and mainly the same locations. But the timing on fish was the opposite. One swing and a miss. (strike 1), first thing and then a few hours of nothing. But in the last 1 1/2 we pulled it out of the bag. The emerald shiner and Dr. Death came thru today. Not as large of fish but tonight the ones I kept will be tasty.      Look at that mouth.....makes you happy your not a bait fish ;D   And even though it's me.....this was the only issue of the weekend. I was holding the fish up for a picture and one tail kick later......damn sometimes those hooks are too sharp.   Al is was a great weekend. We got to land fish.....learn some things.......and most of all we enjoyed the company on Grand Slam. Hope to touch base many times this year.  Safe Fishing First, Jack"
