643465,adempsey,2011-11-27 19:02:00,1498," Wow, that's a lot of stuff!!  Did you make the tear drops jigs?   If not, I am sure that's the next step lol!  Check out these home made jigs.  Many are easy (and fun) to do and can turn out really well!  http://www.iceshanty.com/ice_fishing/index.php?topic=160531.0 http://www.iceshanty.com/ice_fishing/index.php?topic=62425.0   I picked up the AP Outdoors Xtreme Ice XI3 3-4 person popup hut (Thanks for that post Cosmos!).  I think I am going to order a new sled as well.  I like this one from Cabelas.  It's on sale and I have some ""Cabelas Bucks"", so even with the expensive shipping it's not too much.  Considered the Aqua-Vu Micro Underwater Camera, but that will probably have to wait.  More of a toy for me really.  The only other tackle I might purchase are some of the new Rapala/Blue Fox Nomad Jigging Spoons.  I really like the Nils Master Hali Jigs and want to test these ones out.  Looking forward to hard water!!!!!!!"
643466,ckrb2007,2011-11-27 19:04:00,449,"I picked up 3 new Rapala R-Type ice rods, a few spools of the new 832 sufix ice braid and a sack full of different spoons, jigs and flouro from my buddy at Normark. Oh, I also got a new puppy to keep the little lady occupied. hahaha Other then these things, I'm all ready to go. All we need now is some cold weather and no wind to freeze up Lady Simcoe!"
643471,Nipfisher,2011-11-27 19:31:00,2449,"All this jigging stuff!  I'll use about 30 Octopus hooks in chartruse. 4-5 dozen split shots, probably 30 dozen emerald shiners or more and my trusty ""door stop"" style tip-ups. I'll only jig occasionally from inside my nice warm shack.   Gonna try some of the salted smelt that we caught this year. Looking for a 40"" northern this winter.   I am a lazy fisherman. I use my Jiffy 3hp gas auger and drive right to the shack."

643584,uglyfish,2011-11-28 03:46:00,981,"Only thing I need is a gas auger! My shoulders just can't handle a manual auger anymore. Couple holes and I'm ready to cry, and I like to drill several holes. Hoping to wife gets that as an xmas gift. Other then that, ill grab some new rods, reels, line, jigs and tackle. Jigs and tackle is a given, don't NEED the new rods, but I could use a couple more.  And going to sell my hut and get one a bit bigger for comfort, with me and the wife in it, plus the heater, camera, flasher, bait bucket... Lol, room is at a premium. Wanna make things a bit roomier and comfy in there."
643588,BillM,2011-11-28 03:59:00,17367,I need some new blades for my Strike Master gas auger and a new sled to pull behind the snowmobile.
643899,Aaron Shirley,2011-11-29 08:00:00,655,"I'm hoping to find one of these under my Christmas tree: Frabill Trekker Shuttle  Other than that, I'll need to pick up a few jigging raps and some spoons... and maybe a dog sled"
643262,Ron,2011-11-26 20:22:00,1683,"Just curiuos as to the new gear people have picked up for Ice fishing this year. I have down sized my hut from the Clam Yukon to the lighter weight and smaller version Frabil DLX Trekker.   As I have been spending most of my time fishing for Crappie on the Kawarthas, I have also purchased a portable hand held ""inspection camera"" by Milwaukee. Well, the camera is for work, but I sure am excited to try it our through the ice!    So if you know of anyone that is interested in buying my Clam Yukon, it's up for sale. I have already erased all the X's on the side of it though, so you won't know my Fishing spots.    Well, what did you guys get?"
643263,misfish,2011-11-26 20:27:00,29133,"Goes to show how long ago I seen you on the ice.Did you have an green eskimo hut? LOL  Tell me more about that Milwaukee gadget.   Im looking for a few new reels and two rods.Other then that,Im good to go."
643264,skeeter,2011-11-26 20:31:00,1907,Well I don't know but Im thinking there is going to be a new X67c ice machine and 2 Sienna SN500FD Spinning Reels under the tree this year.

643282,Rod Caster,2011-11-26 22:20:00,5784," Great items to have  I'll get a plastic sled this year, but the survival suit will have to wait.  So far I've picked up 2 tipups (courtesy of Leechman!), 2 jigging spoons, several pairs of small gloves and some thermal shirts. No big tickets items since I have most of what I need.  What I'm missing the most? ICE!!!!!   That inspection camera looks like the ultimate fish finder in clear/shallow water!!"

Planning on using a stradic a sustain a quantum accurist pt courtesy of Jose and a curado 51 that I couldn't resist on sale from tacklewharehouse.

643339,Fishnwire,2011-11-27 02:46:00,983,"I'm building a hut.  12' x 8', fully insulated...will sleep two and fish four.  Not only will you be able to take off your coat and be comfortable...you'll be able to take off your boots."
643340,Waterfowlr,2011-11-27 02:52:00,19,How much for the hut??
643347,Fishnwire,2011-11-27 03:22:00,983,"  So far I've spent about $560 and four days...and have really nice runners and part of the floor to show for it.  I figure I'll come in around $1200 before I even put the stove in, wire it up, build the bunks, or tin the roof.    The insulation I choose costs about twice to three times as much as the plywood.  I'm also spending a ton of money on dumb stuff like construction adhesive, nuts and bolts, screws, decent used windows and a door...it all adds up.  It's OK though because my recently deceased grandmother left me and her other grandchildren a couple grand or so each with strict instructions that the money be enjoyed by the recipients how they see fit...the wife can say nothing.  I'll try to put some pics up in the next couple of days."
643368,chefboi17,2011-11-27 06:40:00,128,"I got myself a x67c ice machine, and from the sound of it, i made a good choice lol. Anyone know where I might be able to find a micro fin bore? I have a 8"" normal fin bore that I just got, but that micro one looks like it would be a lot easier to walk out with."
643377,phatpelkey,2011-11-27 12:22:00,78,  you reminded me i got a bunhc of macho minnows and forage minnows also lol is all your gear new this year? or all of what you have all together? i could start a new list of my othert gear lol would take me a while to write up tho lol
643460,bassmaster4,2011-11-27 18:14:00,801,since this thread came up  might as well just ask it here instead of starting another. anyone have any experience with the fish tv 7 camera looking to pick one up  but wanna know what people think about it?
