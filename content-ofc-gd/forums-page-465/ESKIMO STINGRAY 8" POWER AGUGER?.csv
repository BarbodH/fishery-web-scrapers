643828,tomO,2011-11-29 02:03:00,363,Just saw that auger in cabelas bargan cave -new this week -priced at 299.00
643829,northernboy,2011-11-29 02:08:00,13,"I have had that auger for about 5 years now.  The thing is awesome, starts quickly and we use it most weekend in the winter and am still on the original blades.  The thing goes through ice like a hot knife through butter, and we do not push it down, just let it eat its way through the ice.  and we get upwards of 2.5-3ft on ice here"
