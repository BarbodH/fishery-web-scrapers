642858,muskymatt,2011-11-25 04:13:00,2608,"What is this, a love in or something? Or an attempt to cloud 45 yrs of losing by reinstating your vows?  It's not ""true fan"" it's ""brainwashing""..........  :rofl2:  I was a leafaholic (brainwashed)...once...  :wallbash:  ....but then I saw the light, no looking back since that day either, man there are some years I'll never get back....  :(  45 yrs....sheese  :dunno:"
642861,Grimace,2011-11-25 04:36:00,2020," The last 19 of those years (assuming you switched to the Sens in their inaugural season in 92-93) you have been cheering for a team that has also not won a cup.  So it looks like, if you are consistent, in another five or six years you will jump ship on the Sens.  Good, then you can be a blow hard to Sens fans and leave us alone.   :-)"
642893,lhousesoccer,2011-11-25 13:48:00,442,"Who here thinks it's ironic that in one breath, muskiematt says Leafs losses are inevitable, and in the next breath he says ""go sens go""?"
642926,grimsbylander,2011-11-25 15:46:00,3016,  Relax boys and enjoy the team. It takes little to no intelligence to take verbal shots at any team or it's fans simply for the enjoyment of being an @$$. We all appreciate good sportmanship on the water or on the ice. Too bad some people don't have the maturity to extend it to the forums.
642984,muskymatt,2011-11-25 20:07:00,2608," Ok...that's just not true.  A little cross team(battle of Ontario) ribbing with the occasional team insult is all meant in fun, at least from my end. Maturity has nothing to do with passion.I've always said I have respect for how dedicated leaf fans are, I just don""t get why  People rib me about the Sens and I take it for what it is...half truth/half hate...no more.  Good sportmanship on the forum is taking it for what it is and not get insulting or immature about it.   How's this, if it came down to the Laffs in the Stanley cup final game against, say, Pheonix, score is 6-0 Laffs with 1 min to go......for that min, I would be a (Choke) Laff fan.  "
642986,Rod Caster,2011-11-25 20:12:00,5784, oh great...now you've offended me.         I'm a Phx fan.
643025,Jer,2011-11-25 21:44:00,1426,   Why???
643029,Rod Caster,2011-11-25 21:58:00,5784," I ask myself the same question sometimes.  As Sinclair said, I was a jets fan and didn't want to be a team jumper, like most Sens fans (aka, ex-leafs/habs fans) so I stuck with them. I like the new jets but I'll stick with phx until their future is decided."
643060,Jer,2011-11-25 23:12:00,1426,  I thought Matty was the only one...
643172,danc,2011-11-26 05:23:00,4677,"Despite the Leafs injury problems, they pulled off an ot road win in a game that they were supposed to lose.  Anyone know if the Sens played tonight??"
643195,muskymatt,2011-11-26 12:43:00,2608," Yup...they got their   handed to them, not surprising though, unfortunately it's what's to be expected for the season. My hopes aren't too high any game except when the play the leafs. two wins in a row against the leafs...  "
643202,Grimace,2011-11-26 12:56:00,2020, I didn't notice if the Senators played last night.  I only pay attention to the good clubs.   I know Buffalo lost a bad one and Boston lost in a shoot out.   Pittsburgh slaughtered some team.  :-)
643241,tb4me,2011-11-26 16:26:00,3295,Yes the Sens played...Sid the kid had a 3 pointer!!! The longer he stays out of toronto the better.....lol
643593,johnl,2011-11-28 04:57:00,197,leafs won again hopefully they can keep it up
643624,tb4me,2011-11-28 14:42:00,3295,"I thought they played a great game lastnight. They were the better team out there. Puck pressure like no others. They also did a great job at keeping the ageless Selanne off the score sheet. Good game boys!!  on another note, the Slumping Caps fire Bruce boudreau..Wonder who he is going to yell and swear at now?....;lol"
643642,Rod Caster,2011-11-28 16:31:00,5784," I haven't heard the Boudreau news yet... That's crazy, I didn't think they'd ever get rid of him"
643643,Grimace,2011-11-28 16:34:00,2020,Dale Hunter is in.  Great hire.
643649,muskymatt,2011-11-28 17:33:00,2608, I think the more important question is; How long will it take before Hunter becomes a victim of Ovechkins ego?????  Is Dale Hunter really going to tame Alex's 12 yr old maturity?
643651,kickingfrog,2011-11-28 17:40:00,8333,He may find it tough working with a salary cap.
643788,tb4me,2011-11-29 00:11:00,3295,"He is the coach, what does that have to do with a salary cap? interestingly enough He has 3 of the NHL's top forwards in Ovechkin, Semin and Green. They have great goaltending too. I think Hunter was the right move!!!"
643793,kickingfrog,2011-11-29 00:35:00,8333," It was a bit of a tongue in check comment about the way some CHL teams recruit and compensate their players and their players families. Hunter's record, good and bad, is what it is. Only time will tell if he can find success in the NHL."
643797,Grimace,2011-11-29 00:41:00,2020,A buddy I work with is the uncle of the twins that play for London.  They live(d) with Hunter.  He says Hunter is an incredible mentor.   The fact that Ovechkin stopped playing for Boudreau is a bad mark on him.  If he plays better under Hunter it is almost proof that he quit on Boudreau.   I always really liked Ovechkin but now I am luke warm at best on him.  I hope Hunter finds success in the NHL.
643812,reelinrolly,2011-11-29 01:16:00,281," Dale Hunter won't take any crap from Ovechkin....guarentee that.  I was fortunate enough to work at the JLC during their Memorial cup run in London, and go to see a ton of Knight's Games.  You could just see the attention and respect his team gave him, I bet you see a turnaround in Washington....either that....or a pouty Russian...lol  Great quote from his first interview with him in washington "" If you play hard, you will play for me""  , should be interesting.   On another note, loving all the Leaf hating on here!!!!!!  Great reading all the negative comments, no matter how obsurd they are!!!  GO LEAFS GO!!!!!"
641829,kickingfrog,2011-11-21 21:52:00,8333,Quick program note:  The CBC is going to have the Pen v Islander game on tonight.  We can now resume our regular scheduled programming.  
641831,muskymatt,2011-11-21 21:54:00,2608," Alright, I'll give you that one...  you are leaf fans...  So called leaf fans refer to when you're booing the team out of the rink for losing...and I never called anyone stupid  Just misguided"
642175,jedimaster,2011-11-22 21:17:00,3472,You're either born a Leafs fan for life or you're... well... you wear a pink skirt on Saturday nights and drink things with umbrellas in it.
642211,greyhawk,2011-11-22 23:50:00,33," Take note of the players that Wilson had when he first came to Toronto. Virtually none are there now - traded to other teams. He couldn't get them to play for him and his style, yet they seem to be doing well with the teams they've been traded to, save Kaberle. With an entirely new team set up for him by buddy Burke he still cannot get them to achieve.  Yes it's time to get rid of RONNIE!!!!!!!!"
642276,tb4me,2011-11-23 03:13:00,3295,"7-1 win over Tampa... 26 points heading into US thanks Giving... a real turnaround from last year. The monster has produced 2, 7-1 victories. Kessel and Lupal are amazing. The chemistry there is second to none. Just read the stats.With a HUGE amount of our roster hurt I couldn't be a prouder Leafer...... GO LEAFS GO!!!!!   :thumbsup_anim:  :thumbsup_anim:"
642277,jedimaster,2011-11-23 03:13:00,3472,"Not a big fan of wilson, but the leafs are now sitting in 2nd place in the division, behind a clearly more talented squad, and ahead of several teams with clearly more talented teams. I say he has earned a job til the end of his contract..."

642356,ccmtcanada,2011-11-23 16:15:00,7971," I don't usually get into the ""my team is better than your team"" thing...but when it comes to being a fan, I am definitely a Leaf fan!  Why is this?  ""Logic"" has nothing to do with it.  Neither does who the players are on the team.  Yes I follow them...yes I watch the games and I want them to do well...but the key reason I'm a Leaf fan is this....  When I was a kid...my dad and I...as a ritual would sit and watch Hockey Night in Canada.  We would watch the Leafs play.  My dad taught me the rules of the game...I sensed and caught his passion for the sport.  It became about sitting with my dad and sharing something.  I remember fondly if I was good that week, that I'd was allowed to have a little bit of Coca Cola and some potato chips.  I remember cheering wildly when we'd score a goal.  I remember when I was very young, I had to go to bed at the end of the first period.  Sometimes I was able to watch Peter Puck in the first intermission.  On really special occasions I could watch the second period and the cool ""Showdown"" during that intermission.  I remember my dad telling me we were going ""shoe shopping"" one Saturday night.  I was maybe 7 years old.  I was disappointed that we weren't going to sit in the family room, with my pop and chips and watch the Leaf game.  We drove into the city...and my dad went to talk to someone on the street (a scalper I learned years later).  He said he needed to ask directions to the shoe sale.  I remember walking through some BIG doors and seeing pictures of hockey players on the walls and thinking ""this is a REALLY crowded shoe store and it must be a great sale"".  We went up these really really long skinny escalators and when we got off and I walked by these strange ""doorways"" where there were no doors...just empty space.  We walked towards one...my hand in my dad's...and walked through the corridor.  It opened up into Maple Leaf Gardens.  I was stunned.  My mouth hung open as I saw the players skating warm up circles.  I looked around at the vastness of the Gardens.  We took our seats...3rd row greens on the Leaf's home side.  I remember seeing Mike Palmateer in net...Darryl Sittler, Lanny McDonald, Ian Turnbull, Borje Salming and Tiger Williams.  I remember when Borje Salming took a slap shot from the point...it deflected off a stick and came up as high as we were sitting.  I remember asking my dad if we had to leave at the end of the first period for my bed time...and was mildly disappointed that Peter Puck wasn't there.  I remember we beat the St Louis Blues 5-1.  So why am I a Leaf fan?  It's not because of how well they do.  It's not because I have delusions of a Stanley Cup.  It's not because I think they are better than anyone else.  I am a Leaf fan because that's just who I am.  It's been ingrained into who I am.  As a child growing up it became a part of me.  I'd never get into it with a fan of another team...it's not worth my time or energy.  It doesn't matter why I am a Leaf fan.  I don't have to explain it to everyone who bashes my beloved team...because I know why I'm a fan...and that's good enough for me.  Sorry for the long winded post here...LOL"
642357,lew,2011-11-23 16:25:00,12766,That was a GREAT story Cliff !!
642359,Gerritt,2011-11-23 16:28:00,6129,  Well said!
642360,kickingfrog,2011-11-23 16:30:00,8333,My first game was very similar Cliff.  Four main memories: Street car ride for a kid from North Bay The brightness of the uniform colours (Detroit was in town) The smell of popcorn The troff in the washroom
642362,Headhunter,2011-11-23 16:55:00,5703,Well said Cliff... most of what you said rings true for me as well... HH
642363,Gerritt,2011-11-23 16:58:00,6129,hahahahah! the troff! havent thought of that cesspool in years! MLG was certainly something magical as a kid... to bad it is destined to become a grocery store now.... did you hear about the Time capsle they found... Loblaws swiftly took it... and I still have not yet heard anything about it... No doubt we will see Weston keep it for himself instead of donating it the HHOF  G
642364,Jds63,2011-11-23 17:03:00,1365,"well said Cliff, brings back similar memories for me as well  BTW .... holy moly !!!!!! Kessel and Lupul are 1 and 2 in NHL points today, I think it was 70 years ago 2 leafs were 1 and 2 in the league ...  :thumbsup_anim:"
642372,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-23 17:33:00,10439,Great story Cliff it brings back lots of memories. I remember my dad taking me to games when I was a wee one too. Back in the 70's when the gardens were full of cigarette smoke to go along with the small of popcorn. LOL And the infamous troff!!! I wonder if some leaf fan saved it and installed it in their own man cave.
642723,bassmaster4,2011-11-24 21:52:00,801,no losses for the leafs yet no sign of muskymatt or any of the other leaf haters
642806,muskymatt,2011-11-25 01:32:00,2608," I'm here, waiting,it won't be long for another loss....history has shown.  No reason yet to think this year is going to be different....  :w00t:  GO SENS GO"
642810,solopaddler,2011-11-25 01:38:00,8605,"Really great story Cliff, thank you for explaining what it means to be a fan for so many of us.  I could ramble on with similar tales, but the bottom line as you so eloquently related, they're not just a team, they're a part of the fabric of who I am. Have been since I was a very young child.  What I'd like to know from Ottawa fans, exactly who did you cheer for prior to 1992?  Unless you're a teen who's never known anything different it was likely the Canadiens or (gasp) the Leafs.  How does one switch allegience so easily?  I can tell you right now if my hometown Hamilton ever did get an NHL team, I'd never cheer for them.  I'm a Leaf fan through and through.  For those of you who once cheered for the Blue and White, but chose to be fans of another team because of geographical location, well you're not a true fan.  A true fan would never abandon their team."
642812,manitoubass2,2011-11-25 01:55:00,11391,"Cliff and solo hit the nail on the head!  This thread made me go back and re-live some great memories, thanks guys.  I'll never understand how my grandpa rounded up enough people to move that tv into the livingroom, lol. The thing looked like it weighed 1000lbs, and it was 8-10 ft wide, hahaha. I made some amazing lego airplanes while watching HNIC!  Great times!"

642821,danc,2011-11-25 02:14:00,4677," You said it all right there Cliff. What a great post of why you love your team and why you're a sports fan. You'll stick with them in good times and bad. When I walked through those hallowed doors to the Leafs dressing room to meet Phaneuf last March, I was on cloud nine. What an experience that was. I was in a shrine that few people could understand. I was in the hockey Mecca of the world. Anyways ... Go LEAFS GO!!!"
642836,ccmtcanada,2011-11-25 02:56:00,7971," Completely 100% agree!  I know many here have similar memories of the Leafs, the Gardens, and being a kid watching our heroes on the ice."
642840,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-25 03:07:00,10439, You got that right Mike!!! I may live in the West now but my team is still the Leafs and always will be!!!!
642856,dave524,2011-11-25 03:57:00,4508," Being old enough to have grown up with the original 6, I remember a day 50 years ago when your loyalty went the way of your junior team , not your geographical location. Grew up in Niagara, in those days if you were in Hamilton you would have been a Red Wings fan, if you lived in Niagara Falls you were a Boston fan most likely , St Catharines meant you followed the Blackhawks. Back then players stayed with the same team longer, not like todays Leafs where I don't think there is a single player left from 4 years ago. Here is a link to the old St. Catharines TeePees of my youth, look at the list of NHL alumni to come out of that junior era, virtually every Blackhawk star of that era. I for one preferred it the old way rather than the bidding wars or however they play musical chairs with the talent today  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Catharines_Teepees"
641477,jedimaster,2011-11-20 16:38:00,3472,"So the leafs if they win today against a struggling team, they will be alone in first in the east, yet they will be the only team currently in a play off spot with more goals against than goals for... I know its an easy answer, win the close games and get destroyed on your losses. Who would have thought a year or two years ago kessle would be a constant top points and goals guy. Anyone know what's going on with the leafs goalie quest? The longer this reimer situation stays like this the more it feels like the leafs are an injury or slump from kessle away from having a 10 game losing skid. Leafs need to pick up a goalie before the goa scoring wheels fall off. For now though its all blue in the big smoke.  GO LEAFS GO!!!!  Off my soap box."

As for the leafs (as of right now) they have more salary on IR then they do on the bench. Things are looking real bad for them. As for the win last night, one can only speculate that Ovechkin and Bruces argument has boiled over to the rest of the team. If they don't do something soon you may see Ovechkin ask to be traded. Either that or management fires Bruce Budro (sp?).. That war wont go on forever between the 2..On a lighter note I hear Ovechkin loves Canada.. I say trade him to the leafs........"

641494,jedimaster,2011-11-20 17:34:00,3472,"  True but the vast majority of teams in a playoff spot at the end of november make. The playoffs. Something like 75 percent.  Its pretty obvious to me the ovechkin is not playing with that wreckless abandon, that everyone hated from him when he was producing. Some players you can reel in and get results like federov, bure, etc... But other just need to be let loose.  Keep him on the ice and leave him alone. He would look good in blue and white."

Typically after 20 games they have already had a big skid, like the one in alfredson's pants, But with reimer skating, here is hoping when and if he gets back on the ice the team gets a boost. The pures fact they are winning any games with scrivens and gustoff in net gives me hope."
641743,addy79,2011-11-21 16:04:00,573, hardly a one man team; Lupul is 3rd in scoring right now.  i luv how all the leaf haters feel the need to chime in with useless comments and zero hockey knowledge.  Carolina's got solid goaltending with guys like skinner and staal up front... they arent a team full of plugs like the sens...

641757,greyhawk,2011-11-21 16:42:00,33,Lets take a look at the common factor in the Leafs poor showing for the last few years.  Change in assistant coaches - that's not it  Team players have been changed over the last 3 years - that's not it  Coach has remained with team thru losing years - that's it!!!!!! Time to get rid of Wilson.  It appears to me that he cannot get the most out of his players. There appears to be NO fire in his approach to motivating his players. Note his benign response to poor plays or exceptional plays. Even the most opinionated and knowledgeable sportswriters agree the Bruins in their Stanley Cup win last year were over achievers - made so by the excellent coaching.  TIME FOR RONNIE TO GO.
641775,jedimaster,2011-11-21 18:18:00,3472,"I dunno, I think the bruins have a pretty strong team lead by chara. He is such a dominant player, he doesn't get nearly enough kudo's as he should. As for wilson, I have never been a fan of wilson, but he seems to have figured out kessle, if he can get the PP and PK working, get reimer back, healthy and productive(lets not forget how much exp this kid actually has). I think we will make the playoff's and be a tough team to play against."

641813,kickingfrog,2011-11-21 20:57:00,8333,"29 teams lose every year, a lot has to go right and some lucky bounces are needed for who ever wins the cup. That is a lot of ifs as well, but that doesn't suit your confirmation bias does it?"
641823,jedimaster,2011-11-21 21:29:00,3472,"There are alot of ifs that go into wining a cup, or any pro championship, As well making the play off's is a dog fight every year. To be the top team is not guarantee your going deep in the playoffs or will win. Look at Van, last year, or chicago the year they won chicago was not a favorite for sure. Boston was not the favorite either. The Leafs are not good enough to be a dominant team and a lock to get in, but they are good enough to fight for a play off spot. 7 players injured including the number 1 goalie and for a good portion a player that will be there top center and they are still in a good spot. My eyes are wide open, and I do see some shining lights. Kessle, Scrivens, Kadri(Even though he hasn't played, when he did I felt he played good), Steckle has been a big boost as has Lupul."

Were are they at then?  Ide rather be a leafs fan with hope then one without? I was 2 years old when i started watching the leafs, man i must have been such a stupid little kid"
