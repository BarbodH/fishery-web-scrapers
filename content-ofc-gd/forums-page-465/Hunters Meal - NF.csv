This was our third year in new territory... we figured it out pretty good   Results was 2 spikes for the 4 of us   First one was 110Lbs and second was 125Lbs field dress... As shown in my previous reports  Today was the day to get our second guest for the freezer   and the tally for the 4 of us was 23Lbs of pure goodness each total  This is all good but the main reason for posting... is the meal my daughter and I got tonight... you guys remember the venison recipe I had posted three years ago... well had some steaks marinaded for a while, prepped the veggies and tatters and here is the results  Not that I want to rub it in  Veggies have been drenched in extra olive oil, salt & pepper, chilly powder and a tea spoon of honey mustard    Steaks drowning in marinade    Tatters being blanched    Tatters drying    The pans getting hot    Tatters and veggies frying    Steaks droppped in the pan    Flipped... other side    End results    Cook to perfection.... medium rare.... ummmm    Next on the menu is pepperettes and spaghetti sauce Hope you enjoy Leechman"
