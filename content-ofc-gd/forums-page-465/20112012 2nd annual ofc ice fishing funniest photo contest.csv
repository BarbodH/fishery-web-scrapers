The rules are, be safe, play safe, no repeat pics from last year. A time stamp(date) should be added,but not manditory at all.If there is an issue with a pic just pm me and i will make a call on it.  The judges will be my two girls, they will decide on all the pics. I will in a disagreement step in and decide yah or nah.Otherwise its the girls decision.  This photo contest is only for fun, there will be prizes like last year. I have had a donation so far, if anyone else would like to donate, by all means do so. I will donate my part. I am hoping for enough prizes for 1rst 2nd and 3rd place. Other than that Be safe , play safe and have fun .
