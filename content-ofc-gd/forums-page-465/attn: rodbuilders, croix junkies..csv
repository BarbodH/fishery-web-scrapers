642954,e-z-out,2011-11-25 17:18:00,1052,Thanks for the heads up doc
642959,Dan668,2011-11-25 17:51:00,1120,"How bad was the shipping? I might order some, steal @ that price if its their newer blanks"
642971,Snidley,2011-11-25 18:51:00,620,"A 9'6"" SC v blank for $100 is a real score for a great steelhead rod either casting or spinning. That would be the same as a 'Croix Legend Elite 9'6"" rod, MSR $400 if you could ever find one in Canada. It would be the best rod on the stream for anyone who tied it up. Wish I knew how to tie up fishing rods that's for sure."
643005,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-25 21:06:00,0,shipping was 30 dollars. not cheap but still a deal since i ordered some other stuff.
643011,SirCranksalot,2011-11-25 21:19:00,3291,    Which steelhead blank would you recommend for local Ont rivers?
643015,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-25 21:24:00,0,that all depends on your tactic.  decide how heavy a presentation you're throwing and what lb test you want to use and go from there.
643041,timmeh,2011-11-25 22:27:00,609,"Interesting, I've really been thinking about trying to build a rod for a while and maybe this is a sign. For some of you guys who've built before, how much work is involved.  Also could anyone give me a cost on the associated costs for a the other supplies I'd need? If someone could give me a ballpark figure that would really help me out. Wouldn't go top of the line but always prefer decent equipment."
643059,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-25 23:07:00,10439, You don't save $$ building your own rods as it becomes addictive and pretty soon you have dozens!!!!
643064,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-25 23:28:00,0,"i tied my first rod on a cardboard box with my thread running through a math textbook for tension.  now i have a hand rod wrapper and it makes the duty wayyyyyyyy easier. i've invested a few hundred into equipment now, but you can get started with very little.  before going forward, i'd recommend watching the rodbuilding videos that mudhole and batson have made.  these videos are invaluable."
643065,misfish,2011-11-25 23:28:00,29133,"  LOL Dave.  Im addictive buying already,dont need to start building."
643310,Dan668,2011-11-27 00:43:00,1120,"Didn't end up buying one cause its the older blank, although the difference is prob minimal, its missing nsi resin. To the guys who buy blanks here, is mudhole my best bet if I'm looking for a croix or phenix blank?"
