643449,JCRG,2011-11-27 17:24:00,57,"I got out friday to try for some late season pike. Could not get the pike to bite but i did manage my first ever steelhead?? x2 What a fight these fish put up! Seeing these fish in pictures is neat, but catching one and seeing it person is a whole other thing. Both fish were released after a quick pic.     Thanks for reading"

643455,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-27 17:50:00,0,Nice fish bro 
643456,Gregoire,2011-11-27 17:55:00,1397,I though about waking up early and trying for some pike...but I was lazy and stayed in bed. If this weather holds up maybe next sunday. Nice catch thanks for sharing.
643459,Victor,2011-11-27 18:04:00,1609,Nice fish. The 2nd is very clean and good looking
643501,JCRG,2011-11-27 21:52:00,57,Thanks for the comments. It was a lot of fun catching these fish and i definitely think I'll be targeting them next season.
643503,JCRG,2011-11-27 22:01:00,57," What's your go to lure this time of year? I've tried everything so far and no luck (spinner baits, jerk baits, spoons, soft plastics...)"
643505,rocheleauc,2011-11-27 22:05:00,205,"very nice dude, good fish for your first steelhead"
643512,Rod Caster,2011-11-27 22:16:00,5784,Great bi-catch I wouldn't wait until next year to target them!  
643526,SirCranksalot,2011-11-27 23:12:00,3291," What, and pass up on those cute lookin' pike!?  Nice catch!!  "
643527,jpfishing,2011-11-27 23:15:00,53,Nice
643533,Djeep,2011-11-27 23:43:00,199,"beauties, i need to hook into a couple like that"
643535,tb4me,2011-11-27 23:48:00,3295,Nice work! That 2nd fish has nice markings!
643544,J-M,2011-11-28 01:08:00,65,"Right on, chunky looking fish! Just curious what bait you got them on? I'm mostly a roe fishermen but want to really start utilizing artificial casting baits..."
643576,JCRG,2011-11-28 02:55:00,57," They both hit a white spinnerbait fished slow, the first one hit it within a couple of seconds of hitting the water, the second one hit it near the bottom. There is a lot of steelhead guys here that fish with lures"
643606,corvette1,2011-11-28 13:14:00,1765,nice steel congrats
643633,johnnyb,2011-11-28 15:59:00,3413,Lots of steelhead rookies (myself included) sitting here slackjawed that you smashed two gorgeous fish with pike tackle.  Well done!
643753,JCRG,2011-11-28 22:16:00,57," Thanks, I sure wasn't expecting these beauties, but as soon as the first fish hit I knew it was no pike"
643756,adolson,2011-11-28 22:29:00,783,"Those are some nice fish - you lucked out. I usually target anything but pike, and what do I catch? Pike!"
