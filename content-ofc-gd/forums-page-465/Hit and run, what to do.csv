I just did a reverse search on the phone number... It's not her phone number by the looks of things. It's a lady who owns a pet care business in b-ville. I do see a dog walker every morning while getting into my truck. Hopefully it gets sorted out tomorrow, but looks like it could still be a hit and run...

643408,Woodsman,2011-11-27 14:59:00,1286,"If you note my post had many question marks. This whole thread has many questions to be answered. Everyone is so quick to blame the neighbor with no evidence which GoneFishn admits. No witnesses, no visible damage to their vehicle & a number left to call that doesn't match the neighbors? No court would award any damages based on the so called facts stated so far in the thread. Much more investigating needs to be done before blame can be accessed. Could it have been someone (matching the phone #) just using the neighbors driveway to turn around or a visitor? Was it the neighbor? Hell I don't know but no one else does either. Police should have been call at the time of noticing the damage."

Totaled my rear passenger side door.  Pushed my car 18"".  No note..  I grabbed my brother in-law, and we went over and knocked on the door.  Found out the girls name after some discussions about what went on last night, and the fact that I new these kids parents where in Florida for a week..  They coughed over her phone number, and she agreed to pay for the damage.  I got a quote from the most expensive place in town (Zenitec).  Then we met up, reviewed the quote, I told her I would do some of the work my self to make it a little cheaper.  She gave me $800 cash.  Transmission blew on the car 3 weeks later, so I put the money toward the down payment on a new VW golf.  If you can find out who actually did the damage, then I don't see any harm in going after them for the repair costs IMO.. Even if it's a beater."

A dent in the door of an old beater that doesn't affect it's operation just adds charactor (or $ in your pocket if you can blame someone)I guess it all just depends on how you look at it and how important money is to you.  No one knows for sure if it was the neighbour or someone else that put the dent there, speculation is just that! Until there is proof no one should be blamed and it sure isn't worth starting a fight over.  In my opinion, if it is so important that you find out who did it and get remuneration, just call the police and let them handle it, otherwise put it to rest and go have a cold one.  No wonder I'm broke all the time!"
643483,GoneFishin,2011-11-27 20:57:00,349,"This is why I was trying to figure out what to do. I have got a hold of the guy who hit me. He acted like he didn't know much about it, couldn't remember putting his number under my wiper for about 2 minute while he went on about how I had the wrong number, he was confirming with me where his car hit my truck and lied about when he left his number on my vehicle (said he came back that night) He acted like he did nothing wrong and told me he doesn't have any money for me and that I can phone my insurance company and give them his number( he didn't give me a name) I asked him why he didn't leave his number right away and he said I've got his number, that's the only way I was able to contact him and that this going to become an argument and said good bye and hung up...   GRRRRRRrrrr, I didn't want to get insurance involved but I have been told my insurance won't be affected. So tomorrow morning I will be contacting my insurance company to give them a phone number without a name... Will they even except that? Or do I need to phone the dam cops and let them straighten this crap out?  At this point I would settle for running my truck into the side of their car.... but nothing less..."

If you really want to be a prick, call the cops and he will be nailed with faling to remain at the scene of an accident. Almost positive that is 6 points. That will really make him learn his lesson and I bet he wont drive away again."
643888,GoneFishin,2011-11-29 05:49:00,349," Lol, well he's not being very cooperative and strongly believes he did nothing wrong in terms of leaving the scene and coming back over a day later.. ""He has no money for me"" but I did manage to get his policy number and name and keep the cops out of it, barely I might add..... I'm not sure what my insurance company is doing because it sounded like they wanted to make a report with the police. (I love Novex insurance through OFAH, awesome customer service) and he just left a message on my phone at 12am telling me he has a question for me. I'm not sure what kind of question he has for me at this time at night lol.. But I'm not getting angry over speaking to this yahoo any more and I'm just going to let the insurance deal with it.  So I think for the most part(unless they out right offer to pay right then and their) if something like this ever happens to you just report it, don't think twice, you don't deserve to be the one jerked around..  Now lets hope every thing goes smoothly from here but I was told as long as his insurance company knows he was at fault then I'm fully covered. He all ready admitted to hitting my driver side door so case closed I would say.. Thanks for all the advise guys! I really appreciate it and learned a couple things  Ohh and ps, I'm pretty sure it wasn't my neighbor, it was hard enough getting his name out of him though so I'm not even sure who he is or how it happened.."

643934,Fish4Eyes,2011-11-29 13:18:00,1022,Maybe you should just remind him that if you notify police he will face a 6 point offence (failing to remain).

643117,John Bacon,2011-11-26 01:11:00,3277," Additional damages would be a concern for a newer vehicle. But if the truck is only to get the OP through winter as he said, and he hasn't noticed any damage yet, then I don't think it be a major concern.  As for fraud, I think the neighbor would have to have a written contract specifically stating that the money would be used to repair the vehicle in order for that to standup in court. If the agreement is verbal, the neighbor has nothing to go on. If a written agreement does not specifically state that the money would be used to repair the vehicle, then I don't think he would have much luck either. The OP can simply state that he deserves compensation for reduced trade value, having to look at the dent every day, etc."

643155,nofish4me,2011-11-26 03:53:00,404,"The real world's not so tough. I back out of driveway, clipped the nieghbours car. Go over and let him know. No big deal. So I thought. He gets quotes of $2000 plus for repair. I say sorry, but I'm not paying that, take it to your insurance company. We exchanged info (at this point I said I would pay his deductible). Guess what, he got car fixed and he didn't have to pay any deductible. Good for me. I also reported it to my insurance company. No increase in premiums or anything. We were both happy with the way it worked out."

643183,Billy Bob,2011-11-26 11:03:00,5865," Officer, you of all people I would of thought would know the meaning of a accident....fault has nothing to do with the word accident...it's a unplanned event...but according to the insurance industry there are no accidents as they all could of been avoided in one way or another...now that's not saying I agree with that definition...but that's the way it is now a days....SOMEONE is ALWAYS at fault and must pay these days. The lawyers ""insure"" us of this....LOL  But getting back to what the OP should do.....if the person that backed into his truck did the right thing in the beginning....well then, the OP wouldn't have to do the right thing now....I really believe if you let this person off, no lesson will be learned and someday down the line he/she will do it again. But this time it might not be, just property damage.  The City of Buffalo has a (bad) Mayor, but he had a good idea...spend federal money to put up security camera's to cut down on crime....while he was trying to convince the common council to spend the money on camera's, his teenage son stole his car and hit several cars along Main Street one night...No one knew who did it at first as the kid LIED all the way to the bank....But low and behold Canisius College had security cameras that not only recorded the Mayor's vehicle hitting all the parked vehicles in the middle of the night, but also his stupid son who got out of dad's SUV and ran home. Many of the damage car owners were only students from the college and didn't have collision coverage or the money to replace or repair their cars. And guess what....the Mayor tried to squash the college's security tapes with his political power....if that would of happened the kid would never have learned a valuable lesson and his next act might have killed someone as this kid got away with other things in the past.

643000,GoneFishin,2011-11-25 20:59:00,349,"Well I am involved in a sort of hit and run. My truck was parked on the road and someone (clearly the person living in front of where I park) backed into the driver side door. No one left a number or anything and there was only one car parked in their drive way for the last 2 nights with no visible damage. Today I came out to my truck and find a small peice of paper with a number saying call me. Now there car is parked in there drive way once again and I feel as if they were trying to cover it up but realized they couldn't. Now I can under stand an accident is an accident and I feel bad because my truck was parked at the end of there drive way. On the other hand they presumably tried to leave and stick me with the bill at my loss, and could be charged, although I have not made a report.  I'm going to give them a call soon but I'm not sure what to do. My truck isn't worth me putting a new door on really and is just getting me through the winter, I guess what I'm saying is would it be illegal to work out a deal with them, or should I just have an estimate done and make a report to save my self from any further complications?."

643006,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-25 21:08:00,10439,By law all accidents resulting in more than $1000 in damage need to be reported. That said a lot of people work out a deal. If you intend to buy a new vehicle and not fix the door you can always get a few quotes on what the repair is and do a cash deal with the person that hit you. I would bet that when they see how much the repair is that they will end up putting it through insurance though. In that case a police report will need to be made.  If you cash out and don't get the repair done you will have extra $$$$ to put toward your new vehicle in the spring.  Call the # and talk to the person and I'm sure all will work out. Maybe they were running late for a trip or flight and that's why they didn't leave a note to begin with.

643045,spincast,2011-11-25 22:34:00,3279,"simply because you report it to the police - which you should to protect yourself - does not mean you have to file an an insurance claim. the problem with agreements is either one party reneges or there is a misunderstanding after the fact. Without the police report,  you have no back up. Or the end result is different than what one of the parties intended. If the truck is due to retire soon, and the only damage is a door - can you get one from a wrecker? If so - what's the cost. If not, what do you feel the damage is worth?  Strictly speaking you could have the guy charged with leaving the scene - but he lives across the street from you? And he thought about it and decided to face the music and let you know?"
643046,Big Cliff,2011-11-25 22:35:00,6899,"An accident is an accident, we've all had them! You have already said you just want the truck to get you through the winter, will the dent in the door prevent you from doing that?  So here is how I would look at it if I were in your shoes:  A dent in the door is no big deal on an old beater, your neighbour had an accident which for all intent isn't really going to cost you anything!  Now you can make a few bucks off this or you can make a darn good neighbour by playing it straight. They will always owe you one if you let it go but the minute you accept a dime from them you are square.  Personally under the circumstances I'd be letting them apologize and telling them to not worry about it. You will come out much further ahead in the long run! Karma my friend, karma!"

If yes to both, maybe let it slide and hopefully this is where it will end. If you did indeed block their drive and do it again in the future, I would think your next ride will receive the same treatment eventually tbh. ymmv  There'a also no fault so they shouldn't be penalized if you go through the collision reporting centre.

He was goona run and let me foot the bill good thing I had a good neighbor and stepped in front of his car as he was trying to hightail his way out of there and almost got hit...the guy had no choice then but to give his info.So in my case I called the insurance,filed police report and got my car into the shop. I have no car for a week but I was provided with a rental.  My point is it's good to have a nice neighbor. You can gain one by letting it slide since your planning to get a new one and your card is old, They had a change of heart so i think they deserve a second chance. So I would give them a call, that would be what I would do."
643069,GoneFishin,2011-11-25 23:36:00,349," Honestly though, the only reason I'm asking this is because I'm sure if his bill didn't cost him much he wouldn't have said a thing. His car was not present for 2 nights, and now it is there with the back bumper scratched to hell (probably not worth him fixing though) If it had of been fixed I would have had no way of proving who ran into me. If he put the note on my window when I got into it or at least that night, then I probably would have apologized for the inconvenience of having my truck across from his drive way. Now I don't even feel like an apology from him is good enough any more as I have been quite angry over it being a hit and run in my neighborhood.  I think I'm going to give the wreckers a call tomorrow and see how much it is to replace the door. After that I will call them and play it by ear."
643071,GoneFishin,2011-11-25 23:42:00,349, Yah to clear it up. I live across the street and my truck is parked directly across from their drive way on the other side of the street. Which it has been for the last 2 months or so..
643073,Billy Bob,2011-11-25 23:51:00,5865," Cliff, I would agree 100% if they didn't try to get away with it from the beginning...but now compensation should be considered because this person will do it again if he/she know they can get away with it.  Basic rule #1 is always get a police report....otherwise things get turned around against you....a police report is a official record that everyone has to accept, including insurance companies."
643075,Jer,2011-11-25 23:54:00,1426,"  Have we really come to this? We can't make a deal, man to man, to get a door fixed? On a beater no less? Why do police and insurance need to get involved?  Talk to the man and see if he'll pay to fix it to your satisfaction. If not, then make the call."
643077,Billy Bob,2011-11-25 23:55:00,5865, Good neighbours don't HIT & RUN....could be that adult beverages were involve from the beginning...
643085,woodenboater,2011-11-26 00:08:00,2277,"Gonefishin,  Thanks for the info, helps me visualize things. Yano, I understand about being on good terms with your neighbours and I make efforts to be one myself, but the fact that they waited several days to drop the note kinda bugs me. Not sure what I would do either.  I'm all for letting it slide, all things being equal, but you've already got at least one member, who should know, suggesting you report it. Possibly this could be a situation of CYA in case there are other issues besides a dented door. It covers their ass as well imo. ymmv"
643086,misfish,2011-11-26 00:09:00,29133,"WOW,is all I can say. You have both thoughts from south of the boarder and north.

LMAO.     UFR  Guess it has."
643088,woodenboater,2011-11-26 00:15:00,2277,"lol, we've got those 30 second spots up here too although not as sleezy. yet"
643089,aplumma,2011-11-26 00:19:00,6896," If you don't have the accident documented then in the eyes of the law it did not happen. It is the only way to cover your butt in this instance. If you want to get the truck fixed then it is the only way that assures you will be compensated for the accident. So let's say you decide to go over and tell him it is $400.00 to fix the truck and he pays you the money.  Case one you might find that the damage is more, and it has cracked the frame which qualifies the vehicle to be totaled. To bad for you because you by accepting his money have entered into a contract that states by your acceptance that his liability is $400.00 in total. Legally you have no further right to bring judgement on him.  Case two you take the money and put it in your pocket because it is a not worth fixing. You continue to live across the street from this neighbor who everyday sees that you are not going to fix the truck... that will not make him a pleasant neighbor I am sure. Further let's say he is down right miffed and decides to file a suit against you for you guessed it fraud for taking money under false pretenses. Their is no difference from defrauding an insurance company with this action as doing it to a citizen, both can win in court. This is something that the average person does not consider but is something that employers have to get advise on to keep their company safe. Does this fit every application? No not really and in this case it could be a moot issue but if it isn't I would feel bad if I didn't give someone the advise that had the least possibility of repercussions.   Art"
