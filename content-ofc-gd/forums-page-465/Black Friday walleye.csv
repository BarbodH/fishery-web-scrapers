So my brother got off work early so we could hit the water...  We got into walleye right away...  We managed to jig up about 50 little walleye...  Then at dark we decided to troll up some bigger eyes...  First pass... Big bro gets hit... 3-4lb eye...  Next pass... BANG... I got slammed hard... After a couple seconds I realized it was no walleye...  I had a musky...  With the current and winds... We drifted a mile... Literally... Before we could hand land this big musky... Ended up wrapped in the line so I was fighting the fish from behind its head... That's why it was fighting so hard...  No tape but it was heavy... Im guessing it was between 45-48 inches...       So now back to walleye...  We start trolling after the long battle we just had...  Manage 3 more between 3-4lbs...  Then BANG... I got smoked again!!!   I'm thinking I had another musky the way it was fighting...  Then as we get it close to the boat I start seeing the fish... Then I see gold...  ""get the net!!!!!!!!""  Big eye... 8lb 14oz         So in the end we got 55 walleye and a nice musky... Under 4 hours..."

643175,TerryC,2011-11-26 06:26:00,196,"WOW, Nice work  Clarence"
643194,mike rousseau,2011-11-26 12:39:00,4661,  Honestly... To catch lots of fish... You gotta get out as much as you can...  It helps you stay on top of what the fish are doing....eating.... And where they are going...
643199,mercman,2011-11-26 12:48:00,7054," AND i bet you are out the door right about now, cause its Saturday cause its the Jewish Sabbath, so ......lets go fishin"
