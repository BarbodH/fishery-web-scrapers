He mentioned to me that he saw lots of ice huts out there last winter and that he'd like me to teach him how to ice fish.  Thinking about getting him some gear for Christmas this year.  I'm assuming that they're either fishing for walleye or crappie near his place.  Does anybody know for sure?  I'd like to know what he'll be targetting before I sink bucks into gear that he might not find useful right off the hop.  Thanks for the help, which I'm sure is coming."
