Number 8 Men have two emotions : Hungry and Horny. If you see him without an erection, make him a sandwich ..  Number 7 Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day. Teach a person to use the Internet and they won't bother you for weeks, months, maybe years.  Number 6 Health nuts are going to feel stupid someday, lying in the hospitals, dying of nothing.  Number 5 All of us could take a lesson from the weather. It pays no attention to criticism.  Number 4 Why does a slight tax increase cost you $800.00, and a substantial tax cut saves you $30.00?  Number 3 In the 60's, people took acid to make the world weird. Now the world is weird and people take Prozac to make it normal.  Number 2 Life is like a jar of Jalapeno peppers--what you do today, might burn your ass tomorrow.  And The Number 1 Thought - - - as someone recently said to me: ""Don't worry about old age - it doesn't last that long."""
