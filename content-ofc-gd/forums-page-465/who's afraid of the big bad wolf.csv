643866,John Bacon,2011-11-29 04:12:00,3277,"Some of the comments are a hoot. Here's one.  "" Comment: If this doesn't scare you to death...I don't know what would. They are not just staying away from us, you know. You could run into this any time you take your family out camping, fishing, hiking, or step onto your back porch now. Except, probably not just ONE.  These guys are eating the Elk wintering in Sun Valley and Ketchum, right in peoples yards now. The Elk have migrated and wintered in the Wood River Valley before there was a Ketchum or Elkhorn...last year a pack of wolves tree'd a mountain lion, and ripped him from the tree, and tore him to bits, right in the valley near homes.  If you go to Idaho Fish and Game website, they have a map, that has dots on it that shows where wolves have been sighted ....they are EVERYWHERE now. In Pocatello, in the South Hills, and in the canyon, in Boise, in every nick and corner now...and crossing state lines too..Good luck Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Wyoming, Utah, and Montana...they know no boundaries.  They have flourished and populated....they have no natural predator, and kill everything you can imagine. So all other animals are their food now, and we will be too.  Do you have any doubt now, from the size of this animal, that they have no trouble taking down Elk? Or a mountain Lion.....Or elephants if we had them!!! They have a healthy appetite. And are depending on us to feed them. There are no creatures safe from these killing machines."""
