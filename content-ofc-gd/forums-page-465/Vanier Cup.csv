643132,Gregoire,2011-11-26 02:10:00,1397,"An upset would be nice, but not sure what the chances of that happening are.I guess the game just started,"
643145,TerryC,2011-11-26 03:07:00,196,LOOKING GOOD SO FAR!  Clarence
643151,Gregoire,2011-11-26 03:30:00,1397,"Looking great, I'm not surprised that Mac can move the ball with a pro prospect at Qb, but I am surprised at how well their D is playing."
643154,TerryC,2011-11-26 03:49:00,196,"23-0 Mac at Halftime! Hopefully Laval doesn't wake up at halftime.  Laval is to good to go down this easy, could be a classic second half....but I hope not! Either way, I'll still be chucking spoons in the morning....   Clarence"

643174,TerryC,2011-11-26 06:22:00,196,  Nuff Said  Congrats MAC.....  What a great game.  Clarence.
643214,Hooked,2011-11-26 13:53:00,891,"What a great game it was!  I was thinking of flipping back and forth to other things on tv after half-time, however, I had a feeling Laval would wake up.  Boy did they!  2 quick td's and they started rolling.  Give them credit for coming back and taking the lead, but I was really impressed by Mac for not crashing under the disappointment of giving up such a huge lead.  If Mac's quarterback doesn't get drafted into the CFL I'd be very surprised.  He is clutch and cool as a cucumber and a good accurate arm.  Some of those throw's you just don't see at that level.  One of the best football games I have ever watched."
643232,esoxansteel,2011-11-26 15:08:00,1307,Mac QB thru for over 500 yrds and ran over 150 himself
643245,TerryC,2011-11-26 17:10:00,196,I agree with everything you said. It was one of the best games I have ever watched as well!   And the Leafs won!  Kinda makes up for the Ticats lack luster game last week.  Clarence
643255,express168,2011-11-26 19:12:00,327,"Absolutely one of the best football games I ever watched, Mac and Laval played their hearts outs both teams should be proud of the games they played. Way to go MAC!"
643299,Cudz,2011-11-26 23:37:00,2652,What a great game.  Couldn't have asked for a better result.  I was really pulling for Mac but Laval has a great program and they always know how to win. Great respect for Stefan Ptaszek as well.  He is a great coach and was a really good CIS player.  I used to play against him when he was at Laurier and I was at Waterloo. Her is a cool pic from a newspaper showing me (#8) about ready to hit Stefan Ptaszek (#14).
