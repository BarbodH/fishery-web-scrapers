642846,limeyangler,2011-11-25 03:26:00,5204,These just look like they would catch fish!   they look good to me
642847,ChrisK,2011-11-25 03:30:00,2772,Too bad they couldn't add a video clip of the action of the bait in the water...
642848,spinnerdoc,2011-11-25 03:32:00,556,They look cool and looks like a good design and concept
642850,Roy,2011-11-25 03:37:00,13728, There is one on their home page.
642852,ChrisK,2011-11-25 03:46:00,2772,I'll go check it out
642854,tightline,2011-11-25 03:47:00,322,Here's one I found on youtube  
642855,ChrisK,2011-11-25 03:48:00,2772,"Not impressed,sorry"
642998,msp,2011-11-25 20:48:00,1336,I actually have quite a few of them and they are pretty deadly. They come in a couple of different sizes and colours. I am going to lend them out to my ice fishing friends and see how the work through the ice. Looks like they could work well on lakers.
643056,Roy,2011-11-25 22:55:00,13728,Thanks. It looks decent to me although I already have so many baits. If I run into any in my travels I'll certainly pick up a few but I don't think I'll go out of my way for the time being.
643074,mistaredone,2011-11-25 23:52:00,913,Price?
643118,msp,2011-11-26 01:25:00,1336,I just dug up this photo from the first time I used the Jig Wobbler. A small pike that crushed it. The lure has been a pretty good producer since then. I think they retail for about $10. Quality componants too. 
643635,johnnyb,2011-11-28 16:13:00,3413,"My first thought was for icefishing...not sure if that's because of the looks of the lure, or because Limey posted it    I'd give it a try for sure...."
643645,mike rousseau,2011-11-28 16:50:00,4661,Looks like the crankbait version of an erie derie
