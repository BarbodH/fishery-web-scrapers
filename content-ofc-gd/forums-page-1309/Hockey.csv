7489,kennyman,2006-12-01 23:05:00,737,"Okay now,no doubt they are the most storied franchise in hockey. In the sixties the Leafs were right there with them. The seventies belonged to Montreal,no question. BUT, in non pre-historic times they haven't exactly been ruling the league. Since the eighties the Islanders,Oilers,Devils and Wings have ruled. Had Mario stayed healthy the Pens would have probably gotten a couple more and been added to that of those franchises labelled ""dynasties"". In more recent years (say the last dozen or so) one would have to agree although the cup has alluded Toronto they have had more success,playoff appearances,conference finals, etc. than the Canadiens. Neither has exactly been breaking any records mind you. That said, Leaf fans have been treated to a few good runs in the playoffs (thanks""Killer""). Sadly it was just enough to give us a glimmer of hope,but man was it entertaining. I was on the edge of my seat alot of times. Can you imagine the streets of Toronto had the Leafs won ? It'll happen again guys. Just let me be alive to see it dear lord."
6992,bassmaster4,2006-11-30 21:07:00,801,with all this controversy in the past few days  here is the poll taht will decide which of teh two is better LEAFS   or habs     GO LEAFS GO!

7006,ShaunB,2006-11-30 21:21:00,73,I have to go with the Habs myself.  I have been a fan of them since i can remeber.  The other perk is that I am only 22 and I have got to experience my team winning the cup!!!
7011,carll2,2006-11-30 21:32:00,443,"haha id rather vote for phoenix before the leafs but seriously this isnt a fair situation, of course most votes will be for the leafs cuz most people are from the toronto area lol...  how about that weather?"

7049,Spiel,2006-11-30 22:43:00,9065,....A poll on a fishing message board will not determine which team is better. It will only mirror the posts and opinions of those posts that you've already been reading.
7053,Roy,2006-11-30 22:47:00,13728,I've taken out the 'Habs pass Leafs' thread because folks resorted to name calling. This one will go the same way if the same thing happens. People just don't want to hear that crap.
7076,Mike the Pike,2006-11-30 23:27:00,3421,This should settle it ! Its no contest .We haven't got a chance. publish this poll in the Toronto Star and it would be a fair Race.How many quebecors on the board 1% were hanging in there considering the odds.LOL David Vs Goliath.Have fun rubbing it in.   GO HABS GO
7091,Motorhead,2006-11-30 23:58:00,163,Sorry just couldn`t bring myself to vote for either team  Pittsburgh all the way
7126,Mike the Pike,2006-12-01 00:39:00,3421,"Here is something Leaf fans and Habs Fans should enjoy.I hope you enjoy. Two guys from Toronto die and wake up in hell.  The next day the devil stops in to check on them and sees them dressed in parkas, mittens and toques warming themselves around the fire. The devil asks them, ""What are you doing? Isn't it hot enough for you?""  The two guys reply, ""Well, you know, we're from Canada, the land of snow and ice and cold. We're just happy for a chance to warm up a little bit, eh.""  The devil decides that these two aren't miserable enough and turns up the heat.  The next morning he stops in again and there they are, still dressed in parkas, toques and mittens. The devil asks them again, ""It's awfully hot down here, can't you guys feel it?""  Again the two guys reply, ""Well, like we told ya yesterday, we're from Canada, the land of snow and ice and cold. We're just happy for a chance to warm up a little bit, eh.""  This gets the devil a little steamed up and he decides to fix these two guys. He cranks the heat up as high as it will go. The people are wailing and screaming everywhere. He stops by the room with the two guys from Canada and finds them in light jackets and bucket hats, grilling sausage and drinking beer.  The devil is astonished, ""Everyone down here is in abject misery, and you two seem to be enjoying yourselves.""  The two Canadians reply, ""Well, ya know, we don't get too much warm weather up there in Toronto so we've just got to have a cook-out when the weather's THIS nice.""  The devil is absolutely furious, he can hardly see straight. Finally he comes up with the answer. The two guys love the heat because they have been cold all their lives. The devil decides to turn all the heat off in hell.  The next morning, the temperature is below zero, icicles are hanging everywhere; people are shivering so bad that they are unable to do anything but wail, moan and gnash their teeth.  The devil smiles and heads for the room with the two Canadians.  He gets there and finds them back in their parkas, toques, and mittens. NOW they are jumping up and down, cheering, yelling and screaming like mad men!!!  The devil is dumbfounded, ""I don't understand, when I turn up the heat you're happy. Now it's freezing cold and you're still happy. What is wrong with you two???""  The Torontonians look at the devil in surprise, ""Well, don't you know? If Hell freezes over, it must mean the Leafs have won the Stanley Cup."""
7151,lunkerbasshunter,2006-12-01 01:25:00,2585,goooooooo leeeeaaaaaffffssssss goooooooo!
7272,jediangler,2006-12-01 13:47:00,1923,"They both lost last night. The Bruins however, won in a shootout."
7373,robin,2006-12-01 17:56:00,46,Should have copied a link to the vote for The Habs So that when they clicked on them it linked you to a site for Shrinks!!!! Robin
7402,walleyejigger,2006-12-01 19:06:00,876,GO HABS GO  HIP HIP HUET
7421,kemper,2006-12-01 20:01:00,2232,as usualy captain mats comes back from injury to save teh day and the leafs....blow.  GO LEAFS GO. please. win something. anything.
7431,kennyman,2006-12-01 20:33:00,737,"I'm a Leaf fan until death. The teams will decide for themselves who is better on Saturday. Let's face it, neither of the teams is playing great right now. Both have a bunch of young players and hopefully are headed in the right direction (they both should get decent draft picks this year LOL). Both teams are really entertaining to watch and the Leafs are quicker and younger than they've been in a while. If both teams stick to their (rebuilding) guns they both should be good in a couple (or maybe a few) years. One thing for sure, it is special when these two teams clash. It's a rivalry that goes back long before most of us were born and will continue long after we're gone. It's emotional, it's exciting and it's great for hockey. It's especially great for Canadian hockey. So,being that it's good for hockey for me to say this. I hate those ""stinkin"" habs    LOL. Here's a little something for you.  "
7436,carll2,2006-12-01 20:48:00,443,not that i know anything about hockey but may the best team win  
7437,irishfield,2006-12-01 20:51:00,26272,LMAO Carl !
7444,specktacklure,2006-12-01 21:01:00,56,Why are the Leafs like Canada Post?  They both wear uniforms and don't deliver !!  go sens go !!!
7457,Moosebunk,2006-12-01 21:48:00,3970,"Pretty much the dumbest poll, as in all of sport; not just hockey, the Montreal Canadiens are the greatest dynasty of any sports team with more cups/trophies and final round wins than anyone.  Ignore that, you ingnore fact, which makes you ignorant."
7458,xrap,2006-12-01 21:52:00,683,"25-13 I guess where the best, ahah habs suck"
7471,Mike the Pike,2006-12-01 22:40:00,3421,If the poll was done in Quebec the Leafs would only have 1% of the vote.  There are alot more Habs fans in Ontario than Leafs fans in Quebec.And many now cheer for the Sens in Ontario.Should of added the Senators to the vote maybe it would be a 3 way split.  Now back to fishing this is getting out of control.
