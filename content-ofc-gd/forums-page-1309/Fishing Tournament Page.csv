6425,irishfield,2006-11-29 15:11:00,26272,"I think it's one thing that hasn't been restored yet Maureen. I'm still waiting to give Mike my 31 1/2"" Wally for team 5!"
6576,tjsa,2006-11-29 22:46:00,1578," You know, I had completely forgot about the tourney. I had MuskyJohn(jigs) take over the reins for me, but now he does not seem to be around( some kinda dustup happened on the board a month or so ago, I think). I don't have any links to anything now. And with the demise of the gallery where all the previous entries were uploaded, well...........................  Maybe try this anew starting in february again."
6578,irishfield,2006-11-29 22:50:00,26272,I think it's all a conspiracy 'cause team 5 is kickin @$$ !
6585,tjsa,2006-11-29 23:01:00,1578,I wouldn't know.  I don't believe it for a minute!!!  But I don't know.
6595,Ron,2006-11-29 23:30:00,1683,"Here's the latest link I got Maureen.  http://www.ofntournament.com/tourney.htm  Only thing is, I don't think it is right. Team 5 has my NGL trout in their line. It hasn't been updated for quite some time either.  Riiiiick, oh Riiiiiick! What's scoop bud?"
6607,motv8tr,2006-11-30 00:03:00,2587,"Thanks guys, I know one link is working as I recieved confirmation of an entry from a team member, guess I'll have to get him to give me the link he used and I'll pass it on here.  As for Team 5 kicking a$$, keep dreaming Wayne, as that's all you've got  Maureen"
6663,setomonkey,2006-11-30 01:10:00,872,My season is pretty much done and I didn't make any contributions to my team (Team 5).  I guess I'll have to start planning for next year's tourney...  Mike
6738,camillj,2006-11-30 04:04:00,1988,That sucks ... I carried my camera and OFC Cap and tapemeasure EVERYWHERE ... for nuthin ?  And Team 7 had it wrapped up
6739,irishfield,2006-11-30 04:07:00,26272,Thanks for the post camillj ...  Scratch that...I see someone stole your nuts and replaced them with a squirrel.
6892,motv8tr,2006-11-30 16:41:00,2587,"Ok, it was never lost, and here is the link for the tournament, courtesy of my team mate Camillj  http://www.ofntournament.com/  Thanks John  Maureen"
6985,misfish,2006-11-30 20:53:00,29133,"So if I read it right,there is a tie?"
7187,irishfield,2006-12-01 03:01:00,26272,"Only 15 days to go...can't even find our Team rep to give the entry too...  31.5 "" Wally. Dano has the tape measure shot as well if anyone disputes it's length.  "
7189,setomonkey,2006-12-01 03:05:00,872,"Nice entry for our team, Wayne!  Mike"
7194,irishfield,2006-12-01 03:13:00,26272,If we get it entered and if this things still a go. BIGFISH...what's the news?
7206,fishdawg,2006-12-01 04:02:00,912,"wayne i emailed Mike a 31"" eye last month,   he never gave me a ""corfirmation"" email like he did with other entries that i sent him earlier on this season"
7224,irishfield,2006-12-01 05:18:00,26272,Just dug thru my old stuff and found the email address [emailÂ protected] so I've sent it to Mike there. Hopefully the tourney is still on track.  Wayne
