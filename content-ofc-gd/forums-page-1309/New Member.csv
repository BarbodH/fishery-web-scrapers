6993,ShaunB,2006-11-30 21:08:00,73,"Hey guys! I am a new member to the forum.  I have found myself addicted to checking the reports every day since I found this site.  So i went ahead and decided to join up ib the community.  I live in Mississauga, and love to fish for walleye.  Here are some pics from my fishing in 2006.  This is a big perch from Lady Simcoe  This is a two man stringer from my walleye honey hole  This is a big spring pike from the Marten River system  This is a 21"" Spring walleye from the marten river system  Fenelon Falls October walleye  Cyprus Lake samllmouth  Spring bow from the credit  Nice Erie area brown from a quarry "

6997,Pigeontroller,2006-11-30 21:10:00,2793,"Welcome, and don't worry, that walleye fishing will wear off in time and you'll start fishing for something interesting! LOL"

7004,xrap,2006-11-30 21:16:00,683,"Sure looks like a nice honey hole to me, thanks for sharing and welcome"
7005,ShaunB,2006-11-30 21:18:00,73,Well... I do also fish for other species but I love the walleyes!!!  I am in Mississauga so I have the credit right here in my own backyard.  From now until the soft water opening I just fish for steelies in the year round section of the credit.  I will try to dig up some pics from Peurta Vallarta deep sea fishing.  Can you upload videos on here?

7058,ShaunB,2006-11-30 22:52:00,73,yeah irishfield that looks like a very familiar site..  is that were highway 11 goes by....or is that the alternate highway u can take from sturgeon falls?  I go up there every year for the walleye opener and it keeps getting better and better.  I am pretty sure there are some walleye regulation changes coming to there very very soon...well once the pass the new oness for 2007.
7071,tjsa,2006-11-30 23:18:00,1578," And a nice ""honey"" also, I like the dainty hold with the manicured and painted nails,  Welcome to the hotel OFC,  ""you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave"". Nice introduction and pictures, but the consensus around here is that they are called pickeral,  And the self portrait in the mirror is quite good."
7083,irishfield,2006-11-30 23:43:00,26272, That shot is looking South! I'm pretty much sitting over the 64/11 junction taking it. Shows Hwy #11 and the little bridge is the one going into Martin River Provincial Parks campground.
7088,lunkerbasshunter,2006-11-30 23:52:00,2585,man that is one heck of an introduction!  Nice pics and welcome aboard!  CHeers!
7093,ShaunB,2006-12-01 00:01:00,73,thanks for the great welcoming guys.  I try to get out atleast once a week so I will have lots of fishing updates for everyone to read.  I will have a Georgian Bay tribs report coming up after the weekend.  I see North East winds coming so many of the tribs will get some great runs!!
7103,fishinfool,2006-12-01 00:10:00,366,"The fourth picture looks to me like perhaps the mouth of Wickstead, just under the bridge south of Beaverland Camp.  Irishfield My parents and Aunt and Uncle used to own the lodge in your picture at the bottom left, it was called Land O Lakes Lodge and at the time the Trapper Trading Post on 11 was also owned by us. I miss the place and usually get up there two or three times a year fishing.  Sorry ShaunB, didn't mean to hijack your thread.  Stan"
7104,ShaunB,2006-12-01 00:12:00,73,here is a nice vid of a monster pike being landed....don't mind my one buddy he was quite excited to see sucha beast of a pike while trolling for walleye (or pickeral...lol)  p.s. the password is    shaun    it will log u in as read only the vid is the second one after the sunset   i hope the vid works
7115,trapshooter,2006-12-01 00:25:00,1234,Great intro to the board Shaun.  Lots of good pics too.  I laughed at the one of the walleye in your house with your nice shirt on.
7149,setomonkey,2006-12-01 01:21:00,872,"Great intro, you've figured out the secret (lots of pics).    Welcome to the board...  Mike"
7153,Rich,2006-12-01 01:29:00,3927,Great pics & video  Your last name isn't Pineo is it?
7155,ShaunB,2006-12-01 01:37:00,73,no my last name is Bannon....again I love this board so much because people actually use it.  Fis***tario.com (not sure the rule about that kinda stuff)  has forums that are like watching paint dry.  I remeber times when u would go on there and people hadn't posted anything in like 3 days.  There is nothing better than an active community of web users.  It also helps out when people want to know about a certain body of water. Thanks again for the warm welcome!!!
7156,Rich,2006-12-01 01:39:00,3927,Man I must have had a brain lapse considering your username is ShaunB LOL
7166,Clampet,2006-12-01 02:04:00,1947,Your a mite welcome!
