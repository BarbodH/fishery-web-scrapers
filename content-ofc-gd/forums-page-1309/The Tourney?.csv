7267,bucktail,2006-12-01 13:31:00,1857,I know it's been crazy busy with the new board going up and everyone asking a million questions about it but what is the status of the yearly tourney. Usually its announced at the Xmas swill. Only asking cuz i think my team won!!!!!!!!!
7269,misfish,2006-12-01 13:43:00,29133,"Theres no ""my"" in team.LOL  You guys and gals are 7 points out of first.Team 8 and 3 are tied."
7370,irishfield,2006-12-01 17:53:00,26272,Where you getting these numbers from Brian!? I'm still trying to confirm the tourneys still going and can't even find our captain.
7384,misfish,2006-12-01 18:26:00,29133," Check Mo,s thread,theres a link Wayne.   Jerkbaits are tied with team three."
7389,Spiel,2006-12-01 18:32:00,9065,"....Here's the link.... http://www.ofntournament.com/tourney.htm  Not sure how up to date it is, I know team 8 is missing it's NGL Trout entry?"
7392,irishfield,2006-12-01 18:39:00,26272,Yep...that's the link..and why I was curious where Brian came up with his team leaders... as Team #5 is shown leading..although apparently we have Ron's trout. I have a 31.5 walley for the team to give us another 126 points and if by any stroke of luck Crazyhorse remember an OFC logo in his Musky picture from the other day....
7394,misfish,2006-12-01 18:44:00,29133,I LIKE THE OTHER LINK.................. DOH

7396,setomonkey,2006-12-01 18:56:00,872,I forgot the tourney results are reported at the Dec swill.  Another reason to go if you haven't made up your mind yet...  Mike
