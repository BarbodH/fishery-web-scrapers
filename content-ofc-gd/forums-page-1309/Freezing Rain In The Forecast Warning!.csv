7057,dsn,2006-11-30 22:52:00,1018,Well Looks like some freezing rain is in the forecast. I wonder how bad it's gonna get? I guess this will be the first mess for the GTA. Maybe it will help out in the making of hardwater. Wishful thinking.      But drive safe out there everyone tomorrow morning !!! I'm not sure when it will start though.
