6715,calamari1965,2006-11-30 03:16:00,10,"Ah that's fantastic. You must be excited. I think it's great that a local bar runs a contest like this so us ameuter,honest fishingpersons can win prizes like this. Was it a free meal? I don't target musky, but would like to try one day. Any chance you could post a picture of the big Musky you caught to win Angler of the Week. Was it one that you caught last week on the Niagara?  How wonderful."
