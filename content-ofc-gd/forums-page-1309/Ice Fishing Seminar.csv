Wil is a very established Ice fisherman and also prominent on Lake Simcoe for ice fishing. The seminar times are 11:00am  and again at 2:00pm. Last years seminars were really good for anyone who ice fishes, and hopefully Wil will give some of his secrets up on Simcoe.  TJ said it was ok to post this."

6962,Terry,2006-11-30 19:45:00,14456,I can almost see his house from mine I wonder if he would drive me there and back from the seminar  oh Wil
7242,Blake,2006-12-01 12:03:00,418,Ya never know Terry maybe he will.  It should be very interesting to hear his seminar and hopefully give up a few tips on Simcoe.  It's a good day out as well to start thinking about the hardwater season.  With this cold front going through this weekend maybe a good time to get the ice gear ready as well.
7244,Terry,2006-12-01 12:06:00,14456,"well, he sure knows his stuff"
7279,lunkerbasshunter,2006-12-01 14:07:00,2585,wow thanks for the heads up i am really interested in sitting in on one of these!  Cheers!
