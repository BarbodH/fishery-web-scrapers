6987,ccmtcanada,2006-11-30 20:54:00,7971,UPDATED WEATHER WARNING....FREEZING RAIN FOR MUCH OF SOUTHERN ONTARIO TOMORROW MORNING.  This is for anyone travelling Friday morning...please be extra careful out there!!!! =============================================================== 3:34 PM EST Thursday 30 November 2006 Freezing rain warning  Freezing rain and ice pellets developing by Friday morning.  This is a warning that an extended period of freezing rain is imminent or occurring in these regions. Monitor weather conditions..Listen for updated statements.  A Major winter storm developing over the southern U.S. will spread a broad area of precipitation into southern Ontario on Friday. Plunging temperatures tonight in the wake of a cold front will cause this precipitation to begin as freezing rain and ice pellets in a wide swath extending from Lake Huron to the Ottawa Valley during the early morning hours..Then spread northward as snow later in the morning.  Significant amounts of freezing rain are possible in areas covered by the freezing rain warning. Current indications are that up to 20 millimetres may fall. The relatively warm and wet ground in the wake of todays rain may lessen the amount of ice accretion on roads and sidewalks. However the accretion on trees..Power lines..Automobiles etc may be appreciable.  Snowfall amounts in areas covered by the winter storm warning may exceed 15 centimetres. However the more southern regions will likely receive lesser amounts due to mixing with ice pellets and freezing rain.  The storm centre will move off to the east on Friday night at which time the precipitation is expected to taper off.  Environment Canada continues to monitor this developing situation. These watches and warnings will be updated as conditions warrant.
7262,ccmtcanada,2006-12-01 13:20:00,7971,Hope this isn't too late for ppl....it prob is for today.....this from environment Canada...  4:45 AM EST Friday 1 December 2006 Wind warning for Picton - Sandbanks Park issued  Strong wind beginning this evening and ending overnight.  This is a warning that damaging winds are imminent or occurring in these regions. Monitor weather conditions..Listen for updated statements.   A Major winter storm located over Indiana this morning continues to spread a broad area of precipitation into southern Ontario as it is moving towards the province today. As the storm heads northeast..It will collide with a cold air mass left in the wake of a cold front that went through yesterday. This will cause the precipitation to briefly begin as snow before turning to freezing rain or to simply begin as freezing and ice pellets in a wide swath extending from Lake Huron to the Ottawa Valley early this morning..Then spread northward as snow later this morning.  Significant amounts of freezing rain are possible in areas covered by the freezing rain warning. Current indications are that up to 20 millimetres may fall. The relatively warm and wet ground in the wake of yesterday's rain and the recent mild spell may lessen the amount of ice accretion on roads and sidewalks. However the accretion on trees..Power lines..Automobiles and any exposed object may be significant. The freezing rain should change to rain or snow depending on the area later this afternoon in the west and early this evening in eastern districts.  North of the freezing rain area..The precipitation which should start late this morning will remain as snow and could be mixed with ice pellets this afternoon. Snowfall amounts in this area are expected to be between 15 to 20 centimetres.  Additionaly..Regions just north of the freezing rain area such as Bancroft - Hastings Highlands - Denbigh..The southern portion of Barry's Bay - Killaloe and Renfrew - Arnprior - Calabogie are expected to receive between 10 to 15 centimetres of snow and ice pellets and the precipitation is also expected to change to freezing rain for a few hours early this afternoon.  As the low moves northeast through southern Ontario into southern Québec this evening..Very strong possibly damaging southwesterly winds of 60 gusting to 90 km/h will develop near the east end of Lake Erie and over Prince Edward county near lake ontairo. The very strong winds will diminish somewhat overnight as they shift into the west. In the Picton - Sandbanks Park area winds will subside a little later on Saturday morning.  Once the storm centre has moved into southern Québec this evening it will take the precipitation with it leaving a few flurries in its wake.  Motorists should exercise extreme caution as hazardous winter driving conditions are likely especially on untreated roads. Strong winds near lakes Erie and Ontario will also make driving difficult. Travel plans should be altered accordingly.  Environment Canada continues to monitor this developing situation. These watches and warnings will be updated as conditions warrant.
