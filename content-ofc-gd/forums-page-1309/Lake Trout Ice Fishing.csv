Does anybody know a good location, that is not to far away from Toronto (may be four/five hours to drive)? What about Lake Nipissing?  Regards, Werner"

7025,irishfield,2006-11-30 22:05:00,26272,...but NOT in December. Check the regs very closely. Not that many zones you can fish Lakers in December.
7028,fishindevil,2006-11-30 22:11:00,6254,"the best thing to do is geta charter to fish the lower niagara river ,they have lots to chose from they fish whats called the BAR,where it flows into lake ontario and fish all winter long,its not uncommon to get 30-50 lakers in a day fishing with some of those charter guys they know the river real good and fish are there all winter long....there have been many TV. shows at the bar about lake trout go for it.....hope this helps....there is also a niagara fishin board to help you as well.....cheers"

7096,dsn,2006-12-01 00:03:00,1018,I usually head up to Lake simcoe for lakers. But the ice isn't safe for 70 fow til mid-late february.  dsn
7131,Woodsman,2006-12-01 00:45:00,1286,Early Jan. try the lakes arround Temagami. Temagami is closed but the nearby lakes should be open. Maybe Cross or Cassels Lakes. Also Bark Lake near Barrys Bay should be open.
