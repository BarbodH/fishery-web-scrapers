7110,kennyman,2006-12-01 00:18:00,737,"I fished Valens yesterday (if you can call it that LOL)   . Threw all kinds of stuff out there, but no takers.I knew the weather was questionable at best, but I if I didn't go I would have kicked myself. It was still nice to get out and I knew I had no chance of catching fish at home. I did have a HUGE boil come up right in front of me and man I was pumped. It startled the heck out of me actually. I threw my spinner bait everywhere around it, but to no avail. I was just hoping for one more nice pike to top off my first real year of fishing. Oh well, I can always pray for another chance to get out."
7118,douG,2006-12-01 00:27:00,2693,"A hearty ATTABOY to you, Kennyman.  I have no idea how this works, but even tho I am still a doofus on the water, I seem to have more luck the more time I spend.  Keep at it.  Thanks for your report."
7121,mason05,2006-12-01 00:28:00,258,Glad to hear you got out.  Soft water will be gone soon.  Were you shore fishing or in a boat?
7123,Greencoachdog,2006-12-01 00:36:00,8163," I'd trade catching a dozen small fish for a boil like that!... You did good by getting out, and you're absolutely correct about not catching anything by sitting around the house. One good trip will pay for a dozen so-so trips, and sometimes you have those trips that will last a lifetime in your memories and give you the ""braggin"" rights!!!"
7130,kennyman,2006-12-01 00:45:00,737,I almost brought my canoe (my only vessel). I would have but I couldn't talk anyone to going with me and they are a bit of a pain tossing around yourself (although I'm getting better at it). There are quite a few areas to fish the without a boat anyway. There are a number of docks and a boardwalk that goes right across the lake there. It's actually a nice place. Wish I could catch something LOL.
7137,mason05,2006-12-01 00:51:00,258,"Thanks Kennyman, I'd like to check it out before the ice hits.  Cheers,  Corn Nug"
7145,Clampet,2006-12-01 01:11:00,1947,"Good 'ole Valens. I'ts been awhile, (7 years) since I've been there. Good to hear you had an ok outing."
7164,dr_freelgood,2006-12-01 01:59:00,13,I had some success in there with chest waders and a white spinner with 2 willow blades. I never knew I could move so fast in waist deep water when one pike decided to head between my legs.
7223,ccmtcanada,2006-12-01 05:10:00,7971,"I spent more days gettin skunked that catching stuff this fall, but it was all well worth it in the end.  Good on you to go and try in this weather!!!"
7292,Bly,2006-12-01 14:31:00,1556,Questionable weather??  There are 2 answers to that question...  #1. It is unsafe outside=no fishing #2. It is lousy outside but safe=go fishing!  Good for you for making the right choice....you'll get 'em next time!!  blyght
