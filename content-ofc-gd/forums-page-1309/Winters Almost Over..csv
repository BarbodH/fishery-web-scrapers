6385,Eddyk,2006-11-29 13:59:00,195,Just think. Twelve weeks this Saturday the ice huts have to be off the lakes {Mar 1 07} and then its only about 10 weeks till the May 24 weekend. Where did the winter go ?
6388,Rizzo,2006-11-29 14:11:00,4754,since its nearly over I'll give you $50 to shovel my driveway until the end of March
6391,misfish,2006-11-29 14:14:00,29133," Spoken like a 2nd year Barrie vet,or is that 3rd year."
6393,Rizzo,2006-11-29 14:22:00,4754,"only my 2nd winter Brian.  Worst part is I hear from you ""locals"" that last winter was tame...personally I though it was freakin nuts"
6417,ccmtcanada,2006-11-29 15:03:00,7971,"My wife and I only started fishing 15 weeks ago, so 22 weeks from now is a LONG TIME!!!!"
6426,Bob,2006-11-29 15:17:00,370,I've seen years here where it was almost May long weekend when the ice went out.  22 weeks?  More than 42% of the year.  Too long!!!  It would be nice to think that winter's nearly done but it hasn't officially started yet.  Come on spring!!!
6664,setomonkey,2006-11-30 01:10:00,872,It's going to be a looooooooooong winter...  Mike
6670,Greencoachdog,2006-11-30 01:27:00,8163,"The end of winter is just a week shy of 4 months away, or 15 weeks, or 105 days, or 2520 hours, or 151,200 minutes... it'll be here before ya know it!"
6675,nautifish,2006-11-30 01:29:00,1416," Naaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  Only 22 more days and it is winter solstice which is the shortest day of the year, After that the day's start to get longer and the nights start to get shorter.  Can i hear a yeehawww!!!  lol  We did not have much snow at all here in dover last yr   heck the lake never even froze over so there was no ice fishing down here last yr.  I guess next week temps are sopost to drop but from what i have been hearing down our way we are in for a pretty mild winter again.  Nice thing about winter is you have the summer to look forward too."
6677,fishindevil,2006-11-30 01:34:00,6254,the hardest day of every year is having to put my boat away....   i hate friggin winter
6689,danc,2006-11-30 01:54:00,4677," Well, apparently we have palm trees in Ontario now. So just how cold can it get? Seriously, global warming will be the end of all. And it's coming fast."
6926,Tdel,2006-11-30 18:14:00,393,Looks like the only ice will be in my drink then.
6932,misfish,2006-11-30 18:20:00,29133,"  We,ll be long gone from this earth Dan,before we see the full effects of this.To bad,always wanted to live in Florida"
