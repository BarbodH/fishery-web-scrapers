Great looking gear, with tons of pockets and excellent attention to detail.  Looking forward to giving these a go over the winter months.  For those in the market for a new suit for Christmas, be sure to check this one out...I'm sure the retailers will have them in stock. (They certainly look like they will do the ice fishing job nicely!)  http://www.vexilar.com/purchase/direct/coldsnap_direct.html  All dressed up, and nowhere to go..          Good Fishing,  Justin"
