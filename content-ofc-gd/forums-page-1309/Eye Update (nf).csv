6582,ehg,2006-11-29 22:59:00,2666,"Posted a few days ago that my my wee daughter hit me in eye causing a substantial loss of vision. I was getting concerned about it so wanted to hear others stories of eye injury.  So after the last three days of seeing optometrists and opthamologists, there conclusion is that my daughters blow to my eye has nothing to do with my vision loss. Apparently i have something called optical neuritis. This is related to multiple sclerosis which i have been diagnosed with and dealing with for last 5 years. More MRI's and IV steroids probably in the future. Anyways i probably will get my vision in that eye back eventually. At least all this isn't stopping me from fishing  ehg"

6602,setomonkey,2006-11-29 23:50:00,872,"Not good news but I'm glad you had your vision checked out so you know what you are facing. MS is tough, a good friend of mine has it.  Mike"

6775,ehg,2006-11-30 07:51:00,2666,"Thanks folks, That synopsis may sound worse than it is. Vision problem is temporary, and generally most days i'm painfree and normal with the MS. Just looking forward to next day out fishing.  cheers,  ehg"
6778,SlowPoke,2006-11-30 10:19:00,2984,"I'm glad to hear it's a temporary loss also that it wasn't from your daughter punching you out. You won't have to face that awkward moment a few years down the road when she asks ""Daddy, how did you lose your sight?"".  I temporarily lost sight in my left eye this year from a ""cornial abrasia"", a fancy term for ""you idiot, you poked yourself in the eye"". It hurt like he!! but what bothered me most was the prospect of losing some or all of my vision in that eye. I was fortunate that it healed completely. -Brian"
6800,ccmtcanada,2006-11-30 13:02:00,7971,"Yep...eye stuff can be very scary.  My mother has a disease called RP...a degenerative disease and she is now legally blind with a guide dog.  I found a spot in my eye and went to see my family doc.  He sent me to a specialist with the comment ""Melanotic Lesion"" on it.  I know what melanoma is and it scared the bejeezus out of me!!! I called the specialist and the earliest he could see me was FIVE months later!  I said ""I dont think so"" and I went on a mission calling specialsts all around Ontario.  Located one in Oshawa that said he could see me in 2 weeks.  Had simple eye surgery to remove the lesion about a month later and luckily it wasn't malignant...  The surgery was interesting....I was fully conscious....he said keep your eye open as I saw a VERY sharp instrument come closer and closer.  It's instinct to close your eye when you see something like that....he said it wouldn't hurt....he LIED!  Oh well, all is ok now.   Eyes are nothing to mess around with...so I'm glad you had it checked out."
6906,bigbuck,2006-11-30 17:18:00,2449,"Ehg, try to exercise as hard as you possibly can, lots of jogging (treadmill or outside), and light weights as often as you can. A friend of mine started a heavy exercise program after living with MS for over 10 years and being laid up many times after it acted up. He dropped from 260lbs to 175lbs and has not had his MS act up for over 5 years. His doctors are stupified but say that all the exercising definitely did him a heck of a lot of good. He even wrote a book last year about his trials and tribulations."
7327,ehg,2006-12-01 16:16:00,2666," The samething has happened to myself, bigbuck. I went from 220 lbs to 150 lbs in last few years. Never been more active in me life as well. This eye thing might be worse thing to happen but will improve. Thanks for other replies.  ehg"
