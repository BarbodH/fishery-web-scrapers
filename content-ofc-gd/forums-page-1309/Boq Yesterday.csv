7047,troutologist,2006-11-30 22:41:00,951,Andrew (Pooch) was good enough to take me out on his boat yesterday. We trolled from about 10:30am til 5pm. The fish got to see a pretty good selection of lures. When it was time to call it quits I was reeling the lure in after unclipping the board and this walleye hit feet from the boat. 24.5 x 15. not a bad first BOQ walleye. The weather was great and it was good to be on the water  
7051,fishindevil,2006-11-30 22:46:00,6254,thanks for the report & nice walleye pic.....well after this big weather event rolls through in the next few days there wont be anybody on the bay for at least 3-4 days its gonna get real nasty...  well we gotta expect it this time of year especially down around the quinte area
7052,Terry,2006-11-30 22:47:00,14456,fishing this time of year without freezing can't beat it
7062,Carp,2006-11-30 23:06:00,1488,A very respectable walleye in any waters.  I love fall fishing.

7191,pooch,2006-12-01 03:06:00,139,That's was as close to getting skunked as I've ever been. Count it as the lucky fish. Guess we should have been casting!
