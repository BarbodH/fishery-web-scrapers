7339,The Urban Fisherman,2006-12-01 16:46:00,2050, well good job cause those are some beauty bass for sure man!  can't complain about the eyes neither!  cheers
7340,lunkerbasshunter,2006-12-01 16:50:00,2585,wow!!!! i remeber having a day just like that a couple years ago.  Of course my awesome fishing day like that ended when i woke up but still eveynight i hope for that same dream!  Thanks for sharing your report!  It is awesome to see big bass liek that in so many numbers!  CHeers!
7439,kennyman,2006-12-01 20:52:00,737,"Wow,that is awesome. Even better with the pics darsky. What a great way to go out. Wish my last couple times out would have been one quarter that successful. I would have been grinning ear to ear. Thanks for the location. What tubes were you using (make, colour,weight of jig,scented, etc.)? Technique? Sorry for all the questions but I'm like a sponge. I love learning and you definetely have a formula for success that someday would come in handy for a newbie like myself (and I'm sure others)."
7087,darsky,2006-11-30 23:51:00,586,"Well,the forcast was for sun & cloud and a high of 12-so when the call came in to go bassin on wed,I jumped. We headed off to the lake around 7 am and were wetting lines by 8 15ish. First smallie came abord after my tube was in the water for maybe 45 secs.......what took so long? The second came not long after that,then the third.I could see it was going to be a tough day.By noon we had caught & released 20-25 bass ranging up to 4.5 lbs. Anyone that thinks that bass don't fight in cold water-may be right.But fortunately for us these bass forgot about being in 45 degree water.Each and every one pulled hard.MOST jumped and some jumped 3-4 times. These bass were super aggressive and have been that way the whole month.Drifting current areas over rock humps were where they first were and after we pounded those areas we headed shallow to cast tubes and rip jig them through weed/rock areas.By 1 pm it felt more like mid May than almost Dec. It was incredible to experience this kind of action in this kind of weather at this time of year.We reveled in it and soaked it up.By 4 pm we decided to call it day with close to 50 bass landed,many more missed-4 walleyes up to 4 lbs loved the tubes as well. This was an all around special day and also my last time on the water till next Spring-just awsome.Pics will follow"

7296,darsky,2006-12-01 14:49:00,586,"thanks for the pic posting help Roy. Guys-I have been catching fish like these since thanksgiving-a real treat.Pike,walleyes and muskies are around too.All these fish came from the St Lawrence near Montreal. Those that put your boats away early are missing out on days like these. Looking out the window right now-I see how timing was crucial."
7317,ehg,2006-12-01 16:04:00,2666,"Awesome report! Your lucky to have such great fishing so close to a metropolis ( Montreal).  good stuff,  ehg"
