I was alone in the dark when this baby hit.  or,  I thought I was alone.  This business dude was taking in the waterfront when he saw my rod bend from afar.  He casually walked closer, and then RAN TOWARD ME!  HE FREAKED!  He yelped, "" WHAT, PIKE HERE, WHAAAAAAAAA??????""  He went into fetal position and yammered:  Black is white day is night Left is right.  When he pulled it together, he took a pic and said it was the most amazing thing he's seen!  Classic!!    Bow,  and  curtain.   Thus ends another edition of MEAL TIME WITH SNAG."
