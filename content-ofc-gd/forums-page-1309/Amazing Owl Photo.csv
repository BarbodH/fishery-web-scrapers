6909,lunkerbasshunter,2006-11-30 17:24:00,2585,wow what a cool pic!
6983,cisco,2006-11-30 20:48:00,597,"The pic Dan submitted from the lady photographer seems legit to me anyway. Look at the eye pupils in IanD's shots. You can see that in low-light conditions the pupils are more dilated (enlarged) than in well-lit conditions. If you look at DanC's pic, the eye on the left has a tad more shading evident and the pupil is a teeney bit larger due to this compared to the right side. Any taxidermist who could get fake eyes and account for this tiny difference would be a real magician to me anyways.Taxidermy requires fake glass eyes to replicate average conditions. To even buy eyes like that is probably an impossibility.  Had a disagreement once with a Great Grey over a dead spruce hen... but that's another story... which did involve a canoe paddle.....  ... oh nevermnd...."
6652,danc,2006-11-30 00:54:00,4677,"I had this photo e mailed to me today. It's the winner of the National Wildlife magazines 35th annual photo contest. Here's the caption that went with it.  Kim Steininger Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania ""I took this picture right before I ducked,"" says Steininger. On a bird-watching trip in Ontario , Canada , last winter, the network administrator noticed that one of the great gray owls she was photographing was staring back at her. ""I didn't think anything of it until it started flying at me,"" she says. Before getting out of the way, Steininger captured this digital photo with a 500mm telephoto lens.  "
6656,Carp,2006-11-30 00:58:00,1488,AWESOME !!!  I probably would have soiled my undies if I was staring at that owl coming right at me.
6678,Ron,2006-11-30 01:35:00,1683,That is a pretty awesome shot of a Great Grey!  Kinda odd not seeing any background though.
6682,nautifish,2006-11-30 01:38:00,1416,Actually even though the shot of the owl is a great shot its the background that spoils the picture for me.
6735,bpsbassman,2006-11-30 03:52:00,941,Incredible shot! If you stare at its head for awhile it starts to throw your eyes off.
6736,irishfield,2006-11-30 03:56:00,26272," My thoughts too Ron...looks like a taxidermy job, shot with the lens tight to it's nose with a macro lens"
6743,danc,2006-11-30 04:13:00,4677,Wow. You guys are critical. A one in a billion shot and you don't like the sky in the background?
6753,irishfield,2006-11-30 04:47:00,26272,Not being critical...just saying what it looks like. It's a great shot..just doesn't quite look right..
6754,danc,2006-11-30 04:53:00,4677,I think that the Walleye in your avatar looks fake too Wayne. Are you sure that you actually caught it??  LOL
6755,fishnsled,2006-11-30 04:54:00,3520,  I'd have to agree with you Wayne.  The background looks like one you would stand in front of when getting a school picture done.    Cool pic though.
6756,Mike the Pike,2006-11-30 04:55:00,3421,I was up in Northbay visiting my Mom a few years ago In april and had the pleasure of observing about 20 of these owls on one street in a little town called Bonfield.They are quite large birds.I have some shots of many just hanging out on telephone polls this was before we had a digital camera.Mike
6769,sturgman,2006-11-30 06:11:00,249,"Well I for one think its a freakin awesome pic no matter what the backround looks like.  I knew it was a definite skyshot when the image first apeared,                                                          Almost crapped my pants actually!!  Awesome pic Danc"
6779,IanD,2006-11-30 10:36:00,16,"The background might be snow and using a 500 prime that is super fast (f/4) will really do a job on the background. Two winters go when the GGO's stayed a while at Ile Bizard, I spent a lot of time up there looking and photographing them. Even managed a couple of ""In your face"" flight shots. Here is a link to a few of my GGO's- GGO's"
6780,cisco,2006-11-30 10:47:00,597,"Great photo! Thanks! That shot is about the last thing seen by a ....spruce hen, mouse, mole, snowshoe hare, ... before the ole landing gear goes down for the kill. Re the background, simply looks like an overcast day with snow on the ground to me. The 'stalking' eyes are really cool!!!!!"
6781,Whopper,2006-11-30 11:32:00,2174,Pretty amazing shot.  Whopper
6805,ccmtcanada,2006-11-30 13:08:00,7971,Wow...amazing shot!!! And boy does the owl look PISSED OFF at you!!!!
6806,bpsbassman,2006-11-30 13:08:00,941,Unbelievable Shots Ian!!!!!  But your backgrounds look fake.....................................LOL    
6823,pameladallaire,2006-11-30 13:30:00,470,"Wow, Dan now you know to put a mouse on your head.  "
