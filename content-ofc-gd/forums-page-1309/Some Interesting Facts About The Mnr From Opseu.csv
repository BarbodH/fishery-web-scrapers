326,Nemo,2006-11-16 14:58:00,727,Hi found this link on another board I frequent. I know it is the union perspective but some of the facts are interesting and worrying at the same time.  http://www.savethemnr.ca/  Not meant to be political. If it is a problem please pull it.
335,JFR,2006-11-16 15:10:00,498,"It will effect every ethical fisherman and hunter in the province. I'm glad you found the report and posted the link here. Every member of this board should read the report and sign the petition.  I am not a strong union supporter, but on this issue, I am 100% behind them.  John"
337,setomonkey,2006-11-16 15:17:00,872,"This was a good link to post, thanks.  If the figures about MNR funding are accurate, this should matter to anybody who cares about fishing or hunting in this province.  Mike"
344,verno,2006-11-16 15:29:00,178,scary stuff
346,fishindevil,2006-11-16 15:31:00,6254,"its such a shame that,us as anglers & hunters cant do more to ensure that things dont go any farther down hill,"
6218,TAllboy,2006-11-29 00:43:00,4,"The petition is a good thing, but a call to your local MPP's office always has more impact. We all know that without the MNR being strong our fish will be in real trouble.  I am making a call tomorrow."

6390,cisco,2006-11-29 14:13:00,597,"While at Quinte I spoke with a fellow who happens to be a good pal of an ex-MNR fish scientist I knew back in the 80's. Turns out the scientist left due to having had enough of the cuts and crap going on. Guess you can only take so much crap until you bail.....  The good ones already left or are in the process of leaving/early retiring/getting golden handshakes....... which will leave a buncha status quo maintainance yespersons to do the bidding of politician advisors/consultants.  Sad fact is that when the last political party got elected in Ontario, that's when they got to see how bad the books really were.  Hydro, SARS, Walkerton issues all cost cazillions, and especially due to these we're in a real cost-cutting time now.  My opinion anyhoo."
6404,fishindevil,2006-11-29 14:42:00,6254,"its very sad   and pisses me off ontario will no become a poachers paridise,and everyone will suffer as a result,what i would like to know is why is the government not helping them,and what about our licensing dollars where is the money going"
6409,specktacklure,2006-11-29 14:52:00,56,Truly sad i may have to start doin my own patrols of my special early spring spots.Will make a call as well. I would be willing some volunteer work just to help and i'm sure there are other people on this great board who would do the same.Damn governement !
6714,cisco,2006-11-30 03:14:00,597,"With video cameras, digicameras and celphones that take pictures, get the photo evidence and forward to MNR.  If the violators can be tracked down by MNR/OPP via licence plate/boat registration and be identified committing a violation in a photo, case closed.  My guess is that part of the argument to reduce field enforcement is the mandarin attitude of... ""Well, it's their own resources they are protecting by reporting offenders, so why have overpaid COs in the field doing what anglers and hunters should be doing?""  Sad to say, but we better get used to the fact that less field enforcement is going to happen, so we all must become partners with MNR on this vital task."
6828,Marc Thorpe,2006-11-30 13:49:00,621,"Signing the petition is something to support,unfortunately I have little faith it will change anything  Prob is until we as Canadians lay the boot to Politicians,its will never get fixed Fact is till we as Canadians tighten the screws to those supposed leaders,we will not progress at some time,sociaty will have to take back its tax dollars and management or we will all loose  Maybe if politicians brought more sandwichs to work then lunch on our tax dollars there'd be more left to use as expense budget for CO's  A branch of Co's had 15 000$ a year for expenses in doing there job,a minister have 3 or 4 times that amount to go and lunch out and treat their buddies  I think they spent more money at last nights liberal party than the MNR has as a budget,does not matter which party you believe in or support Its all blind faith  Prob is wasting is occurring from the top to all levels of goverment and divisions"
6860,Pete Maina,2006-11-30 15:29:00,213,"I had heard of this several months ago (actually can't recall exactly where) ... kinda wondered if it was really true, but then, considering government in general, I guess nothing is ever really a big surprise.  It's definitely not a good thing; even more amazing for Canada frankly ... can think of few places on earth that would rely on natural resources for so much.  Well, one thing is for sure, if this is the case, even those of you who detest the idea of tattle-taling, will hopefully be watching and willing to turn in folks who overharvest the resource.  I always try to look at the bright side of things. Who knows, ""IF' the caring angling public pays attention and is ready and willing to turn folks in who take more than their share (legally too) fish, possibly the focus mainly on that - could be positive.  One thing I've always said, that besides checking to be certain folks have licenses, it always seemed like way too much effort by CO's is concentrated on nailing people for silly little stuff (like not enuf cushions, or a paddle or ..), while folks that blatantly overharvest fish get little attention.  Pete"
6990,cisco,2006-11-30 21:00:00,597,"Well said Pete! And I gots 2 of yer rods and keep promotin em as the best deal around!  Time for us to do a little more to police our own ranks folks. Let's all quit the whining and keep our equipment and senses alert to help desk-bound COs get the needed evidence against offenders.  I plan to keep a digi camera and my photo-celphone with me at all times along with a pen and something to scratch down licence plates with.  Oh, and by the way, there are two levels of gov't involved here.  The Feds and the Provincial gov'ts. BUT COs are Provincial and are the ones cutback.  So when you're talking gov't cutting CO expenses, it's the Ontario Provincial gov't to chase after. The Feds give $$$ via transfer payments to the Provincial gov't, but who knows if the $ gets to frontline staff Cos as opposed to some other Provincial priority..... like the Caledonia native controvercy."
