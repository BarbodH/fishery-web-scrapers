6238,irishfield,2006-11-29 01:16:00,26272, How bad is it cracked?? Maybe it can be welded.
6263,POLLIWOGG,2006-11-29 01:49:00,835,Is that a tower of power?
6353,Chris Cross,2006-11-29 11:51:00,46,"Can you post a photo. I have a few old lower units kicking around, might have what you want. CX"
6452,Fisheye,2006-11-29 16:39:00,15,"Sleded, check out ""Twin City Outboards"". They are in Minnisota, but they ship world wide. They deal in old antique and late model outboards. Hope this helps ya!    Paul."
6456,Uncle Buck,2006-11-29 16:54:00,1000,"Hey Sleded, i sent you a PM  also, if anyone is looking for a tower of power, i've got one (150HP) PM me.."

6625,steve_paul,2006-11-30 00:24:00,658,"I've got an old Johnson 75HP Seahorse with a bad lower end if anyone wants it.  Also, after talking to my mechanic today I have a 1984 90HP Johnson that needs a rebuild as one of the pistons is screwed   .  He says it will be about $2200 - $2600 for the rebuild - does this seem reasonable???"
6884,John Bacon,2006-11-30 16:17:00,3277,"I am not sure if it is reasonable in terms of a fair price to pay for the work involved; but, couldn't you buy a 20+ year old motor for less than that?"
6896,Uncle Buck,2006-11-30 16:47:00,1000,"guys, Sleded's motor is a 10HP or a 9.8 or 9.9...  not 100HP... Merc 100 is the model #"
6947,Rich,2006-11-30 19:05:00,3927,It weighs as much as a 100hp tho!
7198,Chris Cross,2006-12-01 03:29:00,46,What is wrong with old unit? Can it be repaired? CX
7199,Rich,2006-12-01 03:32:00,3927,It is cracked beyond repair
7216,camillj,2006-12-01 04:42:00,1988,Not sure but you may find this on is compatable http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/MERCURY-OUT...056651163QQrdZ1
7330,Chris Cross,2006-12-01 16:23:00,46,Are the gears and bearings ok? If so we could just change the case. CX
