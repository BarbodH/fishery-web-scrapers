7419,FinS,2006-12-01 19:59:00,463,"was thinking of asking for one for christmas does anyone have one of these and how good are they i am just looking at it for ice fishing, will it keep me warm?"
7430,charlied,2006-12-01 20:32:00,584,"Heard they are good.....but you reall ydon't want just the coat...I would recommend getting a full body one.....thats what I am going for anyways, but that is just me...LOL"
7446,lunkerbasshunter,2006-12-01 21:07:00,2585,wow that is a pretty good deal.  however I do agree with charlied i believe the full body one would be warmer and overall better.  Still a good deal though!
7452,OrangePeal,2006-12-01 21:29:00,37,"I have found with my 1 piece that it is too warm. I walk out on the ice and my 1pc gets me a sweating. Sweating and icefishing don't go together!  I think I will try to buy one of these and put the rest of the money into a better set of pants.  Safety First, Jack"
