This is information found at Aqua Vu They don't include Aqua Vu Scout 50 in their camera comparisons.  Maybe it has or is about to be discontinued.  The differences that I found between these two camera's are in Bold text   Aqua Vu Scout 50 Standard Features Include: * 5-inch viewing screen with adjustable brightness and contrast * 50 feet of 200-pound test cable * 4.5 amp 12-volt battery which provides up to 6-hours of continuous use on a single charge; plus battery charger * B & W Bluegill pattern fish camera with 12 infrared lights for enhanced twilight viewing. * Built-in monitor softcase with zip-out sunshield * Video out jack for video recording or outputting to auxiliary TV * One year warranty  Size: 13.5"" x 9"" x 10.5"" Weight: 14 lbs.  Aqua Vu Scout 2 Standard Features Include:  * A 7.2 amp 12-volt battery that means extended run time-8 hours or more on a single charge! * Battery charger with built-in charge indicator, including new ""quick-plug"" charge system * B&W Bluegill pattern fish camera with 12-Spectral Responseâ„¢ lights and dimmer control for twilight viewing * 5-inch viewing screen with adjustable brightness and contrast * Built-in monitor and camera softcase with zip-out sunshield * 50-feet of 200-pound test cable * Video Out jack for video recording or outputting to auxiliary TV * One year warranty   Tom"
7271,cplummer,2006-12-01 13:44:00,165,i have used the aqua vu for 2 seasons and i found them to be just ok.. under stained conditions (scugog) they suck but when the water is clear they are a god send..go with the scout 2 for the extended battery life and a second battery can be purchased pretty reasonable as well. cliff...
