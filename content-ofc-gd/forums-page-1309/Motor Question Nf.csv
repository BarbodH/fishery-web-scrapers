7050,Matt15,2006-11-30 22:44:00,107,its a 1992 25 Yamaha. As we were fogging the engine we saw water coming out from where the lower unit connects to the upper. Do you guys think there is something wrong with the seal?
7100,irishfield,2006-12-01 00:06:00,26272,You sure it wasn't just water that was sitting in the cover bottom...that pee'd out when tipped?
7106,Fisherman,2006-12-01 00:15:00,7201,"Yes it's normal, my Honda does the same thing, there's a slight indent on the one side between the upper and lower pieces, just a drain port."

7332,Chris Cross,2006-12-01 16:33:00,46,Most outboards have a drain hole right at the seam between the upper leg and lower unit. This allows water to drain out. And in for that matter. The water pump is self draining and self priming(small drain hole in pump housing as well) Some outboards have the drain hole on lower unit just above the nose cone on one side. If you ever run outboard on water muffs and garden hose you will see the drain hole( water will pee out when running and after for a minute or so) Any question about this? Just ask. CX
