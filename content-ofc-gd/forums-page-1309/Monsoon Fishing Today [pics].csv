The weather was terrible but we made the best of it.  I got this little pike slowly bouncing a minnow off bottom.  Little scrap, quick photo and back in the drink.....    Next we hit a small pond I like to call ""The Fishbowl"".  It's so small it's hard not to land something if you put in the time.  I picked up this tiny bass on my new mini xrap.  Sherriff was becoming increasingly frustrated with no fish yet....    Last pic:  Sherriff illustrating his best frustration look.  A face only a mother could love.....    Darkness hit so off we went.  Not the best day to be out but cathing a few little ones still always beats working.  Thanks for coming out Sherriff and John.  We'll try again before the freeze.

7229,Sherriff,2006-12-01 06:16:00,252,"Was a good time Nug.  I am an idiot however.  I was so excited to get out there I did not bring a jacket, a rain suit or anything to protect me from the elements.  Dumbass = ME!  Until next time Andy.  Sherriff"
