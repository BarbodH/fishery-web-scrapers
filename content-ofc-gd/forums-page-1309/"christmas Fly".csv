7635,huntervasili,2006-12-02 05:08:00,1604,Well I was looking for some winter fly patterns and this funny looking steelie fly showed up...  i dunno how great itd be... maybe possibly productive with this muddy water but itd make a heck of a nice ornament...  Bill
7639,Nemo,2006-12-02 05:19:00,727,Nice one. Would like a few for the tree.....
7640,huntervasili,2006-12-02 05:36:00,1604,"Im hoping i might just have the time to go to a craft store to get those crazy pipecleaner things and shiny christmas stuff, so that i can tie a couple of these deer up.."
7643,bassmaster4,2006-12-02 05:44:00,801,i wouldnt be surprised if u caught a fish on that
7658,ChrisK,2006-12-02 12:21:00,2772,Looks like it would be a great salmon fly to me.....
7660,cplummer,2006-12-02 12:27:00,165,i have been tying flies for over 35 years and i have yet to come across a fly like that.. it looks pretty darn cool to me and you have a great imagination thats for sure!!  is it used to attract female reindeer? love it... cliff...
7687,huntervasili,2006-12-02 14:41:00,1604,Its not my invention... I am not that creative i found it on one of the fly tying sites... first time i saw it too...
7689,danc,2006-12-02 14:44:00,4677,"That thing would certainly catch Brook Trout where I fish. The bigger and bulkier, the better."
7692,huntervasili,2006-12-02 14:50:00,1604,Yea it might not be to bad of an attractor pattern... its got some bright colour to it and sometimes those brookies like to eat big stuff thet look like mice... never heard of em eating a deer though  Bill
