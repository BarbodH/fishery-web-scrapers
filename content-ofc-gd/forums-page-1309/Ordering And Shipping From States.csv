7320,krawler,2006-12-01 16:05:00,167,"Im thinking of ordering some equipment from the states but am aware that depending what company they ship with, will ultimately affect the cost of shipping and subsequent charges when u receive the package (forgot the name of the xtra fee).  The company im buying some equipment from only ships with UPS.  How much xtra fees will i have to pay?? I hear USPS is the cheapest.  Any thoughts????  P.S. i dont know anybody stateside so shipping and picking it up is not an option  thanks"
7324,Terry,2006-12-01 16:14:00,14456,yup US postal service may not be the fastest but I always find them the cheapest both in shipping and duty/broker fees
7348,irishfield,2006-12-01 17:06:00,26272,UPS has a wheel they spin to see what your brokerage fee will be. Can be anywhere from $10 to $60 for no determinable reason. USPS..like Terry says is the cheapest. The post office collects $5 for brokerage service and the taxes on declared value.  If the people you are buying from will only ship UPS you don't have much choice if you really want the item...just a crap shoot on what you'll get charged by UPS.
7356,JorgeCarlos,2006-12-01 17:32:00,109,"if u buy from Cabelas, they let u know how much will cost u to shipp to your door before u buy anything, with taxes and fees."
7393,setomonkey,2006-12-01 18:40:00,872,Is the company's policy set in stone? Maybe they only ship UPS but would consider shipping USPS for you.  Mike
