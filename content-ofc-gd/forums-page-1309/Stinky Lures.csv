7117,stasbrute,2006-12-01 00:27:00,206,"Hello fellow OFC,rs.....my ice fsihing lures stink, reminants of minnow was left on some jigs    now it seems all the lues in the box smell, any good tips on cleaning up the stink? Do you think baking soda and water might work ?"
7127,Rich,2006-12-01 00:42:00,3927,I cant imagine the stink being a bad thing ?
7128,Greencoachdog,2006-12-01 00:42:00,8163,"I don't know that I'd be so worried about a dead fish stink on my lures, I'd be more concerned with a perfume/fragrance type smell... baking soda might not be a bad thing, but if it was me... I'd try something to maybe add a little something more to them, maybe a couple cloves of Garlic in the tackle box. I know you prolly think I'm crazy or pulling your leg, but fish really are attracted to garlic."
7132,tjsa,2006-12-01 00:47:00,1578,"we all think you are crazy Glen, lol."
7134,stasbrute,2006-12-01 00:48:00,206,thanks guys you may be right bbr maybe I will just leave them stinky and add some yumm scent when i use them and gcd you are right i do think you r crazy nuttin to do with the garlic though hehe hehe
7135,setomonkey,2006-12-01 00:49:00,872,Would probably help if you can stand the smell! I'd suggest soaking the luers in hot water for awhile and then rinse.  Mike
7139,Greencoachdog,2006-12-01 00:51:00,8163,Tom and Grog... y'all say the sweetest things!
7143,Whopper,2006-12-01 01:01:00,2174,"A few fellows pulled a prank on one of my buds and put about a six inch perch in his tackle box and it was in there for a couple of weeks and man did it ever stink. I think he just left his tackle box open for about a week outside and it went away. GCD has a point on the garlic, I've been using some twister tails that are salted garlic and have had some decent success with them lately.  Whopper"
7148,Rich,2006-12-01 01:12:00,3927,"If you must remove the smell, comet (the bathroom cleanser) and warm water will get rid of it."
7171,cisco,2006-12-01 02:21:00,597,I'd place a small open container of ground coffee in there and close thelid. After a few days toss the coffee and you'll get a nice coffee smell instead.
7184,stasbrute,2006-12-01 02:53:00,206,"ah yes dark rich coffee, mmmmm, I like your groove cisco, is nice"
7211,cisco,2006-12-01 04:16:00,597,LOL Grog  We used to load trailers at Schneiders Meats years ago. Some had a pretty awful smell and still had small claws of crabs on the floor. We'd sprinkle some coffee in there and viola! So why not in a tackle box?
7249,Squid,2006-12-01 12:50:00,1656,Coffee works so does garlic.
7265,charlied,2006-12-01 13:30:00,584,Try vinegar and dish detergent...works everytime when I leave bait to long in containers
7381,snag,2006-12-01 18:13:00,1932," Yup,  that'll work!"
