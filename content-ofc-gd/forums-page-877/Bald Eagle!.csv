320732,hammercarp,2009-03-23 15:38:00,964,If they learn to steal the ospreys catch I guess it means a tougher time for the osprey but we have both at our cottage.
320804,lew,2009-03-23 17:39:00,12766,Bald Eagles are one of the most beautiful birds anywhere and it's great to see them making their way into the Kawartha region and every year there seems to be more of them.  Here's 2 different birds I was able to get pictures of last summer near Peterboro.  There were  a couple others there too but I wasn't able to get pictures of them. They were both large & brown but I don't know if they were young birds or females      
320811,4thgen,2009-03-23 17:54:00,157,Always nice to see them. They have been nesting for a few years close to Lakefield.
320812,evster,2009-03-23 17:56:00,367,"I saw what I think was a bald eagle last year in Turkey Point on Lake Erie.  It flew overhead just at the tops of the trees, probably 15 meters up, carrying a fish.  What a big powerful bird."
320831,bucktail,2009-03-23 18:49:00,1857,Nice to see them making a comeback. My friend saw 3 of them on the ice on Boshkung earlier this year. We have one that shows up every Feb in fron of the Oakville water plant! Havnt seen him in a few weeks so I think he moved on!

321121,carp-starter,2009-03-24 08:18:00,253,"There are eagles by the hundred in the Annapolis Valley. At one time there were not many, if any but a farmer thought of a way of bringing them in. Right now, it is a zoo down there.  Here are some web sites that I have kept from the last few years.  carp-starter  Sheffield Mills Annapolis Valley, Nova Scotia  Search on SHEFFIELD MILLS EAGLE WATCH http://www.eaglens.ca/  http://www.annapolis-valley-vacation.com/eagle-watch.html http://www.outdoorns.com/features/flying.htm  http://ca.maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?csz=S...&country=ca   http://www.outdoorns.com/features/winteractivity11.htm http://www.gov.ns.ca/NATR/WILDLIFE/conserva/18-04-5.htm  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo  http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mnh/nature/nsbirds/feat02.htm  http://www.cbc.ca/thelens/program_261206.html  HE BALD EAGLES OF NOVA SCOTIA    About ten years ago, bald eagles in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley discovered that many of the valley's large commercial chicken farmers were disposing of a few dead chicks each day by depositing them out in their fields. Each farmer has a natural mortality of one or two percent among the chickens, and with millions of chickens being raised in the area the bald eagles were quick to catch on.  This bonanza of extra winter food began attracting hundreds of eagles that would normally spend their winters foraging along the Atlantic coast. The eagles began a daily circuit of the chicken farms, competing with each other for the new and easy source of food. Soon the word spread among birders, who came by the carload on weekends to witness the eagles.  Before long, local people organized Eagle Weekend, an annual event in late January that has attracted thousands of people eager to watch eagles at close range. Now between 400 and 600 eagles are counted here each winter, and a few have stayed to nest.  http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2002/01/27/...agle020127.html"
321150,wiggler,2009-03-24 11:43:00,16,The last couple years I have seen a bald eagle on our lake just outside Plevna. Quite a sight...and HUGE
321176,youngvedder,2009-03-24 12:46:00,72,At my camp (just outside of Espanola) we saw our first one last year on labour day weekend. We've had the place 34 years and this was the first time.  Absolutely beautiful.  Cheers.
321252,Bob,2009-03-24 16:14:00,370,"Brown ones are immature birds.  Both male and female birds turn black with white head and tail when they mature, usually at 5 years of age.  There are lots of them in this area and along the North Channel of Huron.  At maturity, their wingspan is about six to seven feet, much bigger than a goose.  Closest thing in size here is the turkey vulture.  Lots of them here too."
321289,Ramble,2009-03-24 18:03:00,713,"i've seen one hanging around the area between peterborough and lakefield since january.  Lew the juvies are brown for a few years before they get their white heads.  And goldens are HUGE. i've only seen 2, but the wingspan looked 5 feet or better. Impressive to say the least.  -Dave"
