321238,Jet,2009-03-24 14:57:00,364,"I'm one that always offers to help land a fish for someone, often times when I'm on the river and the guy has a net, but has walked down stream so far that his/her net is beyond reach. I definitely understand people not wanting to let a stranger use your equipment, that's why I'll offer to do the duties though I often also lend my net to another person in their group so they can do the honours and blame themselves if they lose it in the process!  Plus the quicker I stop that fish from thrashing around in the water (and scaring away other fish) the quicker I can get my line back in."
321288,irishfield,2009-03-24 18:00:00,26272, I'll be sure to land your next Temagami fish for ya Bud....
321317,Headhunter,2009-03-24 19:23:00,5703,Thanks Wayne! You may be holding the net for a long long time! LOL HH
319606,rapala14,2009-03-20 16:12:00,44,"I'm pretty sure this topic has been on this board before but i just can't help myself... Went out and hit the pier in search of some rainbows a couple days ago (as did a whole lot of other people that morning haha) and i've got my trusty extendable handled net with me, of course.  But heres what gets me, there are always people fishing on the pier that don't have or have access to a net to successfully land there fish, if they get one.  Its not like i really mind lending my net out to someone so they can land there fish, but to me, you kinda shouldn't be out pier fishing without one.  What if everyone decided to rely on everyone else to have one?  I didn't start pier fishing till last year because i couldn't afford an extendable net till then (and never got one for christmas  ).   Anyone else feel this way or is it just me?"
319627,tonyb,2009-03-20 17:32:00,1637,Start charging a fee -$5 per fish
319677,ld17,2009-03-20 19:35:00,319,"Don't sweat the small stuff.  Some people don't plan ahead like you do.  Next time just tell them, you should get a net so you can land that fish!  Heck I let people use my stuff all the time.  I'm just thankful I can afford the stuff."
319707,xeon,2009-03-20 20:51:00,350,"Two idiots forgot their ice auger last year after a 30min walk into a lake. I laughed at them, but Im not that much of an excellent person to tell them their truck is the other way. I figured if I forgot my auger, would I really like to get an ear full from someone I dont know about forgetting things?  Probably would make the situation worse if you told them no, and you'd probably get your line crossed over a few more times that day than normal. And I know you want to say no, but you kinda have to bite your lip those situations."
319716,BITEME,2009-03-20 21:09:00,1968,Well I gotta tell you I dont bring a net and have no intention of it either it stays in the boat not on the peir. Call it whatever you want My 2 cents
319734,tdotfisherman,2009-03-20 21:58:00,317,"I don't mind lending my net, or helping land a fish on the pier. I figure why just stand there and watch someone struggle, or lose a fish? I'd rather help them, and get in on the action a little bit too. Last fall I spent countless hours on the pier trying to catch Salmon, and didn't catch a damn thing. But it was some of the most fun times I've had due to the positive and interesting interactions I had with other GTA anglers trying to catch giant Chinooks.. Why not lend a hand..or a net? Some day you might need that hand in return.."

319761,Sinker,2009-03-20 22:57:00,8692,"I've had mine busted too.......some people just don't know.  I don't have a problem netting a fish for someone else, but your not gonna get my net in your hands.  Sinker"
319777,GoneFishin,2009-03-20 23:37:00,349,"Lol, I have to admit I do this often.. but I have to walk from my house so I don't like carrying a net all the way down there.  I could see how that could get annoying but I can tell you one thing, it sure beats drilling holes for people who decide to go ice fishing without an auger"
319867,Greencoachdog,2009-03-21 02:00:00,8163,Do like Mike the Pike does and beat the hell out of the fish with the net until it comes off the hook... after a couple times of that they won't be bothering you!!!
319870,Marko,2009-03-21 02:06:00,854,I am trying to figure out how do people break nets when trying to land fish. Yea piers are a little bit high but do the handles snap or the netting?  I wouldnt mind handing out my net or even helping somebody land a fish. How often do you see a guy catch a salmon off a pier nowadays anyway
319872,buckster,2009-03-21 02:14:00,530,"  Im pretty sure most of those pier fisherman can afford a net also....  I mean it costs a lot less than a custom sage and an ang spec reel!  Whenever i fish salmon or steel be it winter,spring or fall i always put my net in my truck.    A lot of the same faces out on the piers thats the only saving grace to the regulars with no net!"
319877,Sinker,2009-03-21 02:16:00,8692," When you try to scoop a 25lb chinny, and don't pull the net up vertical, the handle will snap quite easy. The netting is fine, but the handle can't take the weight horizontally.  Sinker"
320863,fishermccann,2009-03-23 20:56:00,655,"It is the fisherperson type of thing to do , lending your net!"
320864,Marko,2009-03-23 20:59:00,854," Thought it was a common sense pulling a fish that heavy vertically, you would need a steel handle to lift that fish horizontally."
320908,Sinker,2009-03-23 22:54:00,8692,"  Like I said, some people just don't ""know"". At least the guy who broke mine was nice enough to pay for it"
320932,Lunker777,2009-03-23 23:24:00,866,"  Hahah That pretty well proves the point that they can ""usually"" afford there own !"
320936,Sinker,2009-03-23 23:32:00,8692,"I didn't give him much choice.....it was either replace it, or swim"
320941,codered,2009-03-23 23:46:00,123,I have never peer fished  is it possible to land a fish with out a nett? and are people fishing peers this time of year i thought it was a fall thing  ... how long of a handle do you need ? thx guys interesting topic.....
320942,CLofchik,2009-03-23 23:46:00,854,"Heh decision time......you're next to a guy on the pier.  He has a nice brown hooked.  It's his first one.  He has it hooked on his Rapala by the rear hook only, and there's two dangling trebles you just KNOW are going to end up in a ball of mesh.     What do you do?  P.S.  After this weekend I have two nice holes in my net.  Aargh."
320961,Sinker,2009-03-24 00:15:00,8692, Are you sure its not an atlantic??
321016,codered,2009-03-24 01:41:00,123,I use the black rubber  the hooks dont get tangled.. anyone else use these netts?
321221,Flappn,2009-03-24 14:11:00,245,"There's no excuse for going pier fishing without a net. Understandable you may forget it, however I believe many take advantage.  My net stay's by my side."
321225,Headhunter,2009-03-24 14:31:00,5703,"Lending a net is no diffferent to me than helping someone stuck in a snow drift, out on Simcoe. You help because it's the right thing to do... you lend your net for the same reasons. If you don't, well, the Karma gods will find you. If you don't want to lend it out, why not net it for them yourself? I guess I'm a little more open to helping others then some here. If yah lent your net and it comes back broken, you got no one to blame but yourself. If you help them land the fish, you may end up with a friend, future fishing partner etc... to my mind, that's worth a heck of a lot more than the value of a net. HH"
321227,kemper,2009-03-24 14:34:00,2232,"I never thought it was a big deal to scoop someones fish?  Same as when Im in the river and someone who is alone hooks a fish near me...I always offer to land it for them. Sometimes you get a no thanks I got it, sometimes you make a fishin buddy  seems like a simple thing to do to me"
