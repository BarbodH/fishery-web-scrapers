I have a 12' aluminum and motor and have easy acces to bradford or holland landing . thx again guys ."

321164,jeffw,2009-03-24 12:22:00,267,The water still has to warm up alittle bit. 45-50  degrees seems to be the ideal temperature for crappies to come in. If you can launch your boat and head towards the mouth you will probally do best.

If the pump on the east side is running I would suggest to use a boat near the over hanging/submerged trees and definatley around and under the bridge. I would use a 1/64 jig head and a white or minnow colour tube under a very sensetive float. This time of the year they shy bite, watch you float for any movement. I noticed sometimes that the float doesn't go down on a take, instead the float moves sideways. Hope this help, these are some tips that Ive been useing for the past 14 years fishing that river. Oh ya, the pike like to come in there around the same time the crappie run, it's fun landing them on 2# test though."
