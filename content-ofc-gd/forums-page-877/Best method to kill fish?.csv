320292,Beats,2009-03-22 17:20:00,543,I usually bleed trout and pike.

320296,Dondorfish,2009-03-22 17:26:00,1000,Drowned them - in cooking oil ( after a pre-dip in beer batter )  - lol  I usually cut the gill and bleed them out on a stringer.   Don  
320307,tjsa,2009-03-22 18:00:00,1578,"Being as I am a day tripper, and usually fishing out of canoes or a 12 ft. boat, I find a nice 24"" section of a broken hockey stick, or same length piece of 3/4"" EMT does the job perfectly. Couple of hard whacks, put fish in a bag, and put them on ice in the cooler. I do not use stringers, as we quite often have to portage or paddle a bit, and we would have to lift the fish out and put them into the boat or carry them in the cooler anyways. Also, surface temps compared to what depth the fish came out of can be quite different, so we just kill them and put them on ice. I have snapped the necks of small creek brook trout and rainbows allowing them to bleed out, but that was in my youth, and I do not participate in that activity any more. For salmon on Superior, we kill them immediately, and clean them in a bucket right in the boat than put them on ice. Salmon break down a lot faster than any other natural species of fish."
320308,Radnine,2009-03-22 18:01:00,1538,"When I was a kid we went to an Expos game at Jerry Park (talk about dating myself, saw Rusty Staub play) and I got this 14"" long model of a Louisville Slugger. At it's largest diameter it's about 1"" and made of hardwood. It is the perfect fish bonker. I can't think of much quicker or more humane way for a fish to go (unless he sees it and has time to think ""Oh Christ, he's going to hit me with that mini-bat from Jerry Park!"") Jim"

320637,Ramble,2009-03-23 12:57:00,713," Bonk on the head is the most humane hands down. Instant lack of consciousness. Just remember you're trying ti kill the fish. So hit it like you mean it, and hit it twice. Kill as soon is possible and put it on ice. Stringers lower the quality of the meat. The fish are stressed and they get a lactic acid build up in the muscles.  Kill'em and chill'em.  -Dave"
