321036,the spirit of fishing,2009-03-24 02:09:00,141,I know there's been instructional posts on knot tying previously; however a friend passed this site on to me showing various knots and how to tie them in animation. You can see which knot is useful for a given application and how to tie it. The soft water season approaches and here's an opportunity to practice your knots before you hit the water. Have fun.  http://www.animatedknots.com/index.php

321044,rbaquial,2009-03-24 02:29:00,968,Yup! always a good reminder - I've been to that site... but I've personally found this site to be the best...  http://www.fishing-live-bait.com/fishing-k...hing-knots.html  good instructional videos.... and he uses more visible props...(than other guys using ACTUAL fishing line)  nothing worse than actually being out on the water... then FORGETTING how to tie it (its happened to me already this year when I was thinking of the Uni-Knot and the Snell)
