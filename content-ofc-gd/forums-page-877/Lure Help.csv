I want to buy some lures to shoot, I'm going to BPS later. Never fished the region and was wondering  commom lures that would be used  when targetting bass laker etc. It's a siummer thing so no ice stuff. Nothing too big in the 3 to 5 inch range.  I'll be here until 4 pm.  Thanks"

321934,misfish,2009-03-25 23:00:00,29133,"Although spoon fishing is something of a lost art in many places, Len Thompson's Five of Diamonds - The Lure of the North - is every bit as effective today as it ever was. Trolled, cast, even vertically jigged - no matter the species - this classic lure has earned a place in every angler's tackle box. ""Anyone fishing without a Five of Diamonds isn't playing with a full deck !""   -   Ken Schultz, Field & Stream  A Canadian fishing tradition since 1929, the Len Thompson spoon - and in particular the Five of Diamonds - has probably caught as many fish as any lure ever designed. First fashioned from car springs and sold on consignment, Len Thompson spoons have, over the years, legitimately earned the title ""The Lure of the North"". - so much so, that this entire series based on classic Canadian fishing lures was inspired by the Len Thompson spoon and the Thompson-Pallister Bait Co. slogan. Rivaling Eppinger's classic red and white Dardevle as the most productive fishing spoon of all time, the Len Thompson Five of Diamonds is a fixture in every serious angler's tackle box. Actually, the Five of Diamonds is a colour pattern (YR model - yellow & red), rather than a lure design and is believed to have been inspired in the late '40's by the playing card pattern. First offered for sale in 1950, the Five of Diamonds only recently became the company's best seller. Now available in a variety of sizes and shapes, this fishing lure icon has proven itself worldwide for dozens of species of sportfish.  Out of Lacombe, Alberta, the family-run Thompson-Pallister Bait Company is now managed by Len Thompson's grandson (3rd generation), Rick Pallister. Approximately 2/3 of a million lures are produced annually - punched, polished, deburred, and hand painted. Until his death in 1979, Len Thompson himself actually attached the split rings and treble hooks to the Five of Diamonds."
