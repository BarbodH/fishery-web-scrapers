321132,singingdog,2009-03-24 10:11:00,1047,They are very popular amongst cross country skiers...especially at races. You can pull them over your racing boots and have warm comfy feet in between. Great piece of gear.
321226,bigreddog,2009-03-24 14:32:00,84,"I've had a pair of NEOS overshoes for years, and although I haven't used them much in the past, they are handy when I have.  I see that NEOS also makes hip wader versions now, which might be interesting as a backup or as an addition to the ""emergency fishing kit"" I keep in my car.  Cheers."
321242,FLEX ROD,2009-03-24 15:20:00,394,"I see that they have cleats on them i have not ever seen them could they be used as wading shoes?  Just slip on the stocking foot and you are good to go.  Any feed back on this would be great, as I have a bad leg this would make my life alot easier.  Thanks in advance,  FLEX"
321311,bigreddog,2009-03-24 19:08:00,84,"The soles are typically not thick or rigid enough to be used without a pair of shoes underneath.  Also, wading shoes are not designed to keep water out, but to drain relatively quickly after being submerged.  The NEOS overshoes aren't designed for this.  I'd imagine that once the shoes start taking on water, it wouldn't drain properly until you took them off.  You could try the hip wader (River Trekker) version, but they don't have the metal cleats nor would you have the flexibility to wade as deep as you could with waist- or chest-high waders.  Hope that helps."
