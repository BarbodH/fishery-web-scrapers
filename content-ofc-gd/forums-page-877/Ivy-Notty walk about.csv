320005,StoneFly,2009-03-21 17:49:00,574,How was the Fishing?  Water looks Decent...
320008,Rich Clemens,2009-03-21 17:58:00,3131,Nice pics.   Don't underestimate the power of water and the ice flows.
320017,misfish,2009-03-21 19:32:00,29133," I knew there was something I forgot too do.LOL  Water was that very nice pea green.  I didnt fish today.Heck, we didnt see anyone on the river today."
320018,misfish,2009-03-21 19:34:00,29133,"Rich, that last pic.Is where we park.A good 50 or so yards from the river, and the banks are 20 ft high.  Simply amazing."
320123,BillM,2009-03-22 02:05:00,17367,Still looks a bit blown.
320125,Joey,2009-03-22 02:11:00,9122,"Wow, what a mess Brian.  Great pics tho.  Joey"
320138,pigeonfisher,2009-03-22 02:47:00,696,"When I lived in Burlington, Ont.  16 Mile and Bronte both used to get blown up like that.  What a sight to be seen.  We used to love walking the river, mostly 16 mile."
320893,StoneFly,2009-03-23 22:23:00,574," For Ivy, I would say that is about Normal color.  Not another angler in site???  I wonder if its due to the C&R only?  Never fished it in the spring,, Lots of Fun in the Autumn,.. May have to check it out!!!  As for the Damage,..Its amazing what happens to the water level there!!!  I have seen massive trees 5' in diameter move hundered of yards after a single storm/melt event, the floodplain for that area can be 100-200m wide in areas."
320999,BillM,2009-03-24 01:12:00,17367,I've fished Ivy quite a bit and it's still a bit brown compared to what I've seen... I took a drive down tonight and it's gotten it's greenish tinge back...
321001,fish_finder,2009-03-24 01:16:00,370,Man......I've never seen the burgs up that far.  Imagine how it looked down there when it blew out!
