321388,KelfuN,2009-03-24 21:50:00,246,"i have the supra 3 as my backup..  fairly comfortable, its like 4mm of cushion on your butt. very warm in the winter, but summer you'll sweat to death.."
321402,troutologist,2009-03-24 22:19:00,951,"echo what kelfun said. Great wader for winter but warmer than my previous 5mm neoprenes.  Also I found them a bit short. Im 6'5"" and the XXL certainly work but in a perfect world they would be longer..."
321468,Jet,2009-03-25 00:25:00,364,"Thanks for the replies. So from the sounds of it Bare is a reliable brand that can withstand leaks with regular use?  I've read reviews on lots of brands and many seem to leak after a year or two, so I'm trying to narrow it down to the reliable brands."
321582,KelfuN,2009-03-25 03:19:00,246,"if you have the extra money, pick up a pair of breathables.."
321591,Jet,2009-03-25 03:57:00,364,Ya breathables sound like the way to go and I'm pretty good with cold weather.  The Simms Freestone's look good. Anyone have these? So far online reviews have been very favorable. http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...__SearchResults
