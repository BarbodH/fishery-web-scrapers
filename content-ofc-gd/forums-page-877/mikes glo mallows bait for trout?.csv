321792,solopaddler,2009-03-25 18:46:00,8605,They work excellently especially in estuary situations. (As do foam ear plugs and cigarette butts)   (Terribly sorry couldn't resist  )

321807,solopaddler,2009-03-25 19:25:00,8605,That wasn't a real answer I was being a smart   . I'm sure they do work especially when drifting faster runs in off coloured water. Also in harbour mouths still fished on the bottom....  That said I've never used them and likely never will (there are better baits out there for fishing those situations).

There no secret, but when the bite is off on roe, and around this time of year, they can be dynamite. Just make sure you rig your splitshot properly as you would with anything floating, Mike's Mallows included."
