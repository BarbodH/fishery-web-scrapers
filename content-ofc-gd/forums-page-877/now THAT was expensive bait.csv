320873,xeon,2009-03-23 21:34:00,350," Im guessing that people either think the species are native to the waterbody (some are, some arnt) and dont understand how dumping bait may displace native populations of baitfish, and have the potential to screw up the fishery in a small lake.  Im also guessing people dont know what Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia is. I can see a potential live bait ban in the future because of it.  The OMNR definitly needs to increase public awareness, putting little ads in the fishing regs is not enough."
320909,Rizzo,2009-03-23 22:55:00,4754,if they can survive the slimy puddle they live in at the Mandarin they can survive a Canadian winter!
320914,camillj,2009-03-23 22:58:00,1988,I'll never forget the experiment we did in kiddy school ... froze a goldfish bowl .... solid .. with a goldfish it it ... one solid block of ice... then defrosted it slowly ... the gold fish swam around just as pleased as punch ...   They are a VERY hardy fish especially in cold water.
320940,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-23 23:41:00,0,Froze yers did ya? We did the opposite. Microwave.  ..only diff was that the fish swam really fast...................... and burst....  Guess they can't handle the heat to well...  Don't freak out people. We just thought the Piranha and Oscar would like their food cooked a bit first. They ate em live or cooked......

320964,skeeter,2009-03-24 00:17:00,1907,EXPENSIVE YOU SAY???? how about the bait shop in keswick just up from the tim hortons on queensway we stopped there on saturday morning to get pike minnows and he soaked us for $10 for 6 of them.. he has lost my business now....
321099,ch312,2009-03-24 04:01:00,1590,those goldfish may be able to handle canadian winters...but not my freezer    caught this one in the grand a few springs ago...  
320191,Rizzo,2009-03-22 12:15:00,4754,"Was looking for some emerald shiners yesterday for some hammerhandle pike action.  Because I know a dozen at Simcoe Bait and Tackle is 5.00 I didn't worry that I only had 8.00 with me. When I stopped there they had no minnows. No problem, I know there's a place in Fesserton on the way north called Huronia Bait and Tackle. Unfortunately my 8.00 wouldn't get me a dozen there. 6 crappy little emerald shiners cost me 6.45! Broke my bank but at least I still got to fish a bit."
320192,Paully,2009-03-22 12:21:00,712,that is expensive! did you catch anything on thoes dollar minnows?
320193,smokin joe,2009-03-22 12:23:00,226,"WOW!      Is it a supply and demand thing?  That's a lot for a half dozen, I'm used to paying 5.00 for a large scoop"
320202,OhioFisherman,2009-03-22 12:41:00,6623,WOW! it`s been a long time since I bought bait! That price makes me glad!
320206,Rizzo,2009-03-22 12:55:00,4754,"ya, I was pretty surprised by the price. Expecting a good day I would have bought more minnows but they didn't take credit card. Luckily I did have a good day on the water. Had some frozen chubs (4 inch) with me to so I split my time between the shiners (2.5 inch) and dead bait on bottom. Ended up going 7 for 13 in only 3 hours so the fish were really on. Live bait and dead bait were pretty much equally effective. All pike were typical 2 pound snotrockets."
320215,bigugli,2009-03-22 13:31:00,6138,"The shop in Fesserton is the only one left in the area and gets to charge whatever they want in the lower Muskokas. Your only options south of Mactier are Midland or Orillia, and they know it."
320217,Billy Bob,2009-03-22 13:33:00,5865,Here's my answer to VERY expensive bait (if you can even get any). http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...rset=ISO-8859-1
320232,bigugli,2009-03-22 14:11:00,6138, Great little tool for when the ice is out. There is still lots of ice up in the Skokas.
320245,tschirk,2009-03-22 14:54:00,261,Goldfish @ Walmart $0.57 ea
320352,OhioFisherman,2009-03-22 19:48:00,6623,"LOL Ted, my brother used to raise them in moms little backyard pond, walleye and smallies ate them like candy on lake erie."
320411,xeon,2009-03-22 22:21:00,350, Getting Ticketed for Illegal bait....Priceless.
320424,pikeie,2009-03-22 22:54:00,380, haha got to wonder where these invading species came from eh! lol
320432,issamhay,2009-03-22 23:08:00,77,"well its pretty much impossible for goldfish to survive Canada's winters, so theres no worries."
320436,Rizzo,2009-03-22 23:24:00,4754,"Anyone know if ""Muskey's Lodge"" or the place ion Mactier sell minnows? Both advertise live bait but that likely means worms during the summer months"
320451,Billy Bob,2009-03-23 00:03:00,5865," Ah, most goldfish are just carp..........."
320458,Burtess,2009-03-23 00:13:00,901," Yeah, where did you hear that one???????"
320511,hammercarp,2009-03-23 02:03:00,964,Absolutely wrong.
320512,hammercarp,2009-03-23 02:04:00,964,Wrong again.
320517,pikeie,2009-03-23 02:10:00,380,"ya buddy im also wondering where u heard that? friend's of mine have a small pond on there property with goldfish in it...... they dont take them out over winter, and every spring the goldies are still in it."
320518,Bob,2009-03-23 02:11:00,370,"Not only do they survive our winters, they grow to quite a size in the wild.  They are in the carp family and classified as minnows.  Imagine a 30 lb carp classed as a minnow?  It's true."
320576,xeon,2009-03-23 04:08:00,350,"Hahaha this is funny. I think its about time someone posted this:  http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/regions/central/p...appats-on_e.pdf  Seriously, I think people need to read it. Its the baitfish primer, shows you what species are legal and illegal. Help protect our waters from being aquariums."
320612,OhioFisherman,2009-03-23 11:50:00,6623,"Laws are a bit different here in the states than up there, with good reason. We are more of a warm water fishery, trout except stocked species are a tough deal to find here. Some of the large baitfish will compete with trout for food. Not a good idea though to ever use any baitfish that isn`t found naturally in the waters you are fishing.  xeon, a very good list. It`s been a long time since I have been to Ontario, but even the bait stores up there that I went to made mistakes, Granted it is hard to look at every ""minnow?"" in the tank, but I have gotten small smalmouth, small brook trout and a moon eye as bait from bait stores up there.  Ya goldfish are carp, and tougher than you think, they were in Lake Erie when I was a kid and still are. Back in the winters of 78-79 which were pretty severe for us here a lot of small lakes and ponds had massive fish kills. Too much ice and snow on top the ice, oxygen depletion kills. Seemed like it killed everything but the carp and goldfish in some waters, a lot had to be restocked.  Not unusual here to be fishing along the shores of Lake Erie and see a 2-4 pound goldfish swimming around, usually have to get into calmer back bays and tribs to see smaller ones.  Back in the 60`s I used to see carp at Pointe Au Baril, sort of a surprise to me as a kid, I also thought the waters were too cold for them."
320673,hammercarp,2009-03-23 13:49:00,964,"Goldfish are a type of carp"" carassius auratus"", the common carp is ""cyprinus carpio"". They can and do interbreed to create hybrids. Gold fish do not grow near as big a common carp do. A 4 lber would be a big one. Koi are the same fish as common carp except they have been bred for colour. They do get big and can be very expensive to buy. None of them should be used as bait."
320712,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-23 15:01:00,10439,"  No so, I saw one in Toronto harbour that went about 5 pounds!!! I don't think it got that fat in one summer."
320761,tinbanger,2009-03-23 16:31:00,1028,"Xeon ,thanks for posting that !   I 'm always surprised how many people I see dumping thier bait buckets into the lakes instead of destroying the bait. I've mentioned it the odd time and get varying responses   TB"
