Being from Thunder Bay myself, I didn't know Walt to talk to personally, but he was a thorn in my side when I played men's competitive slow pitch against him and his team for several years in the mid to late 80's. Walt could whack the ball out of the park just about every time he was at bat. Unfortunately I had the job of pitching to him. The guy was an incredible athlete.  Rest in peace Walt.
