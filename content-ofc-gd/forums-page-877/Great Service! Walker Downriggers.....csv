I went to the Toronto Sportsman show on Sunday and decided to buy a new downrigger.  Grimsby tackle didn't have the mounting plate I needed for it but the walker rep was on hand to tell me he'd personally send me the part.  I was skeptical (seems to me I wasn't always as skeptical as I am these days....sad really)  So I bought the rigger and the plate and gave Graham (walker Rep) my card in the hopes that I'd see the plate at some point.  Well doesn't the thing arrive today in my office.  Two day turnaround....now that's impressive in my books. I often read stories on the board about terrible service, so I thought I'd throw up an example of great service.  Going forward I'll be buying walker products when I'm in the market.... Cheers, -Graeme"
