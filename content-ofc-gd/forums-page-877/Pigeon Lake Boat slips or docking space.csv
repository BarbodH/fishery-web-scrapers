321262,snookey318,2009-03-24 16:48:00,9,Hi Guys  Does anyone know a good marina or were boat slips are available on the southern end of Pigeon Lake for a decent price? I moved into the area a month ago and was hoping i can find a inexpensive spot for my small boat instead of always towing it to the public boat launches.  Sorry if this is a somewhat silly question - Dont really know the area yet but will shortly since the weather is getting nice!   Cheers

As you come out of the Pigeon river on the West side there is a few trailer parks, again not sure if they rent spots or not."

A marina, of which there aren't many, is gonna cost you $700 or so for a 16' boat.  Which side of the lake are you on? There's more options on the east side with Buckhorn and Chemong close by."
