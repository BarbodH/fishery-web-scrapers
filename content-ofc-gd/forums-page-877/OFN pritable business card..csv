321422,Daplumma,2009-03-24 22:55:00,1961,I was reminded from Gerrits post oday how many Canadians I met this year on vacation in Mexico.It would be cool if I had a printable business card with the web adress and logo to tell people where the community is.If you walk to the beach at a resort I know you will meet a Canadian who will talk to you about fishing.We may as well have a card to tell him where we are.Its easier than telling him to Google Ontario fisting.
