GOT OUT TODAY WITH MY BUD KEV.LAST MIN THING . WATER WAS PRIME BUT FISHING WAS REAL BAD . TALKED TO ABOUT 10 GUYS AND NO ONE CAUGHT A FISH ALL DAY. WE FISHED A DRIFT FOR HRS WHERE WE SEEN A FISH RISE EARLIER. NOTHIN. LEFT AND CAME BACK COUPLE HRS LATER. SAW HER RISE AGAIN AND FOR LIKE 2 HRS WE THREW EVERYTHING WE HAD AT HER. BUT JUST BEFORE WE LEFT I MOVED ME JIG A FT DOWN MORE. FIRST DRIFT A FOOT LONGER AND DOWN THE FLOAT WENT. ENDED UP WITH A REAL BEAUTY HEN. THE SAME OLD LAUGHS AS USUAL KEV AND TX FOR HOLDIN MY FISH  LOL

321006,jdmls,2009-03-24 01:21:00,575," I give you credit man.... I leaned out about 15lbs in the last 6 month to get ready for vacation , and that was hard enough..I can't imagine burning off 50lbs in 4 months...That's some crazy cardio !!! . It's not to difficult to gain mass, but to get big and stay lean was my hardest feat to reach and even harder to maintain."
