I know i live on a lake....but Wabigoon sucks at the moment.....has done all winter.

320530,bigugli,2009-03-23 02:23:00,6138,Did a lot better than I did. I got the fresh air and a bucket of bait. Thank God I had fish leftovers in the fridge.
320577,darsky,2009-03-23 04:09:00,586,I wish I lived near Eagle Lake
320594,b2kptbo,2009-03-23 10:40:00,1505,"Thanks for the report, now I'm hungry..."
320611,bushart,2009-03-23 11:47:00,2628,Spring Fishing in your hood is good in several places...they are..  1. Larson Bay 2. Larson Bay 3. Larson Bay  Go around looking for signs of old holes---that'll tell you where you need to be---North and South side  Bushart
320641,grt1,2009-03-23 13:05:00,638,"great report Simon, just as a matter of interest, since I'm waiting (not so patiently) for my spring open water trip to Eagle Lake, What part of Eagle were you fishing and how deep was the ice?"
320648,Tarzan's Jane,2009-03-23 13:10:00,1183,"Nice report...results look yummy.  You know, adding a pic of your baby every now and then would be nice too."
320716,limeyangler,2009-03-23 15:11:00,5204," Fresh air is good too, i'm not complaining.....well....maybe whining a bit.....lol.....but i get spoiled up here too often so i lose perspective every now and then.   Hey Bushart, i remember you telling me this before, was gonna give it a go this year, but my snowmachine is out of action. Might be good to go in the truck with the recent melt, hardly any snow out there now. My buddy Lew lives by Mud Bay on the the West Arm....just round the corner the other way from our place, he says that is an awesome spot before ice out. Thanks for the info...if i get a chance i'll be out there....must only be about 2 weeks before they start to move in to those spawning areas.    I was at Bear Narrows/ Osbourne Bay near the boat landing for Century Lodge Camp. The ice away from the bridge is still at least 24-30 inches, plenty of trucks out there that day. But i dont think the ice wll still be there on May 10th like last year, we have been above 0 Degrees C here for nearly a week straight it seems, during the day anyway.     just for you twilight...........

320878,johnnyb,2009-03-23 21:46:00,3413,"Great report and pics....*sigh* I miss the ice already...don't know if I'll get out on anymore.  However, I am going to join you in the newborn department...we're 10 weeks and cooking nicely"

Thanks Solo, now stop worrying about my 4 tiny walleye and go make me green with envy with another one of your 'EPIC' stell reports!    Looks like the scoop shot is popular...goosd job the fishing was slow....lol, i certainly hope young jack likes eating fish.....even more so...i hope he likes fishing with dad.  Your right, i'm being lazy with the videos lately...i'll improve on that the next time i go.  BTW...lovin your recent reports with your daughter, makes me smile every time i see those pics, you guys have exactly the same smile!      Nothing like the 'EDIT' function eh twilight?

321253,trapshooter,2009-03-24 16:17:00,1234,Glad to see you got your supper Simon.  Heard you got stopped by the CO on the way out.
321335,limeyangler,2009-03-24 20:12:00,5204,"  Lol...yup...and got inspected on the ice too, as you know i have a spare rod with me always, but never have 3 lines down, the CO that approached me on the ice says ""i just saw you reel that one up"",  yeah sure you did...jeeeze.....if ya wanna book me the least ya can do is not lie about it! Anyway i told him straight....""no you did not"" and taht was that, until the road block on the way out, at least 4 or 5 trucks ahead of me, then the guy went through my gear, checked my fish, decent enough guy....just doing what 'we' pay them too."
321479,Joeytier,2009-03-25 00:41:00,3990,Great report.  Can't ask for anything more than that.
