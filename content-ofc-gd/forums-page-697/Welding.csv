456107,misfish,2010-04-15 00:07:00,29133," If you want to get into welding for a living,this is the place to go.You will learn everything from flat to vertical,overhead, also under water welding.How to use many types of stick welding aswell. My company looked at getting me certified for welding ,but for the amount that we do,it was not fesable.  I am pretty much selftaught.I can weld just aswell as many,just not certified.  Thier not cheap,but you will be a great welder when you finish thier FULL course."
456221,Rattletrap2,2010-04-15 04:12:00,1652,"I looked into them this year for some info, but didn't go any further. I teach some welding for the Refrigeration Workers of Ontario union in Brampton and was curious about their program. We do SMAW, GTAW, and GMAW (or Stick, TIG, and MIG).  Mr. B, do you know anyone who has completed their program?"
456360,misfish,2010-04-15 15:53:00,29133,"  Brian,I know of two guys that did the tig only.They are working for a small fabrication place here in Barrie.Lots of work pay is awesome,but man that type of welding is hard on the eyes.IMO  The full course is not cheap."
456509,pike n' whities,2010-04-15 22:14:00,131,"yup, tig is pretty hard on the eyes. depends on the shade you got over them. uhh, i cant tell you much about that course. i've never looked into it at al but i am in the specialist high skills major manufacturing program at my school. i've got whmis, fall arrest and a flat in both smaw and gmaw so far this semester. soon to come is gtaw in the flat postion and boom lifts and what not. all free of charge. might as well take advantage of it while i can right? cause next year i'll be outta that program and into an automotive co-op for a whole semester. though fabrication isn't my specialty."
456573,Radnine,2010-04-16 01:07:00,1538,  At which high school are you a student (if you don't mind me asking)? Jim
456819,pike n' whities,2010-04-16 19:52:00,131,"  oh, uh sorry it took so long for me to respond. kinda forgot about the site lol. anyhow im a student at Korah C&VS."
456870,livinisfishin,2010-04-16 21:39:00,661,Some good info so far. Are you  a welding teacher rattletrap or a refrigeration tech aswell?
457036,Rattletrap2,2010-04-17 12:17:00,1652,"  My main trade is HVAC/ Refrigeration. Been doing it for almost 30 years. I teach those subjects and controls for the past 15 years. I teach all the oxy-fuel welding, cutting, soldering, and brazing for our apprenticeship programs, and have also taught some electric welding as well. We are fully set up with Lincoln equipment for all three processes of MIG, TIG, and Stick.  Good luck with your career! The trades are always a good thing to get into."
457085,Matt15,2010-04-17 14:57:00,107," Rattletrap2,  Were you at the cmx show a few weeks ago, I think I rember seeing you there?"

457138,Matt15,2010-04-17 18:10:00,107," Yea I thought you looked familar, you were talking with one of my teachers Vince Masella."
457654,Rattletrap2,2010-04-19 01:08:00,1652," ok, I can't quite see you clearly in your avatar photo, but yes, I was talking to Vince! Are you in the program at GBC? or already working in the trade as an apprentice?"
