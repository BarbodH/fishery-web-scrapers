If so my question is will that suction cup mount to a 12' aluminum boat at the back. Any other opinions on this model would be great help as well ! Thanks, Jason"
456936,NAC,2010-04-17 01:08:00,369,"not sure about the suction cup except they don't hold for long, but the 170 model(dual beam, more res) is a big step up from the 160 and BPS has em for ~$119"

456941,glen,2010-04-17 01:27:00,2641,I have tried the suction cup before and it kept falling off. That would be ok if you fish water under 50' deep.
456951,Woodsman,2010-04-17 01:50:00,1286,I have the 170. Both the 160 &170 are both dual beam. A useless feature IMO. The 170 has almost twice the pixels. The 170 has twice the power. 1600 watts (PTP) compared to 800 watts. 160 has 4 level grayscale where the 170 has 8 level. The 170 is not offered in a portable that I know of. At least the 160 portable comes with a rechargeable 12 volt battery compared to many portables that use 8 AA batteries. Even on sale CTC prices are too high. Check out BPS or Radio World for better prices.
456987,livinisfishin,2010-04-17 02:40:00,661,what kind of speeds does it fall off at?
457034,The JAY,2010-04-17 12:11:00,239,"When we do our fly-ins, we bring up 3 up with us, and we've never had one fall off. Mind you, those were 14' ers with 9.9s on the back end, so we weren't flying or anything. IMO, if you plan on moving the unit from boat to boat, go with the suction cup unit. If you've only got one boat, get a mounted unit.  "
