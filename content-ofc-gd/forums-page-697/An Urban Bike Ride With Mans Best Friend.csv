I can see why some people worship this. You can actually see it. That usually helps with the credability.     Destination.     And off we went.     I wish these waters actually had fish in them. Well, they do have sucker, carp, catfish and chub but even those are limited due to very poor water quality. I wonder what this river looked like in the 1800's???      Evidence of lurking eyes peeping around dark corners.         I could probably leave Ida like this hovering over a ground hog hole forever. She simply cannot let it go.     This just drives me mad. Sure there's no garbage can at the bus stop but that's still no excuse for dumping all your crap into the ravine. Is it so hard to hold on to it for just a bit longer.     A few more shots...       One happy dog     Thanks for reading. Laz"

457496,laszlo,2010-04-18 17:55:00,487, Thanks ADB.  I wish I could take her fishing with me but her fetch instinct is out of control. As soon as I cast she goes after my bait unless I have her tied to my waste.
