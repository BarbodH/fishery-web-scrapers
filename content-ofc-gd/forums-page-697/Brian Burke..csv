456942,Jigger,2010-04-17 01:32:00,1237,"The chances of the second-rounder being equal or greater than Kessel is infantessimally small. Hopefully the leafs make it to at least mid-pack next year and the first rounder the Bruins pick at that point will not be a proven goal scorer at the NHL level either. The chances of the first rounder this year? Pretty good assumption that it will be a good quality player. Will Hall or Seguin be at 30 goals next year? If yes, then this trade is at worst a wash.  And if Kadri is brought up and dissapoints? Then that too was a failure of a draft pick. If he does well? Then Burkies a genius. My guess is that Kadri is equal/ 1/2 step behind both Hall and Seguin."
457112,ADB,2010-04-17 17:11:00,444," You're right Dutchy, only time will tell.  To me, that is the most rational philosophy.  Everyone knows Burke took a chance by trading the picks, but let's give it time to see if that risk pays off or not.  It very well may pay off and the picks could turn into busts, or Hall/Seguin and next year's first rounder could turn into superstars. The people who are saying that Hall of Seguin will definitively be better than Kessel are just being ignorant.  I wasn't referring to you specifically, but just the general feeling about that move Burke made.  It's all good."
457144,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-04-17 18:44:00,0,"I think Brian Burke is a great GM.He really knows his hockey and how the business side operates.I might very well start watching hockey again full time.  Phil Kessel was an awesome trade. 30 goal scorer? I see a guy with 50 goal potential.  He's young, talented and has proven himself.  As far as Wilson? Not good enough(How he was chosen to coach the US olympic team, I dont know.lol).  We need a more defense oriented coach/team.I like Kaberle alot but lets face it? He is replaceable, but his market value is very high right now and we can get alot in return. I say trade him for scoring power or a solid stay at home defenseman.  What we also need is a solid checking line to protect leads, like Pat Burns did.  On that note?The Ponikarovsky trade was a BIG mistake. He was a consistent 20 goal scorer and CHEAP!With alot more potential.  Giguère? Great goaltender and workhorse. We dont need Gustavson anymore. Trade him or let him go. He still has good market value.  The leafs should do well next season."
457168,jediangler,2010-04-17 20:03:00,1923,Gustavson just signed for two more years with the Leafs. Right now the Leafs have almost $9million tied up in Goaltenders towards the cap.
457185,Oggie,2010-04-17 21:05:00,588,Kessle is a good player but he's been listening to Don Cherry too long. Shoot the PUCK! No pass the damn puck when you can clearly see the other player is wide open. He shoots on a clear cut 2 on 1. Every goalie plays shot with Kessle. He's a selfish player and he will disappear when it gets physical. It's a bad trade and time will prove it.  Dan O.
457203,Dutchy,2010-04-17 22:05:00,416," I agree with that. Tavares for example has been good, but not great. But he is not on a great team. The Crosby's, Ovechkin's and Malkin's of the world, guys who can actually make a team better on their own, are few and far between. My take on TO is that they do a bad job of getting support players. Washington probably have done the best job of that this year. Also look at Burrows? Is he great, not really, but he hammers in 67 points (12 more than Kessel) in the regular season because he plays with the Sedins. Burke wanted the Sedin's in TO badly, just couldn't tempt them in the end."
457221,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-04-17 22:46:00,0," That sucks. We can get Hasek in net and it wont make much of a difference. We have no defense. We should concentrate on building a good defense. Good defense make bad goalies look good. Bad defense makes good goalies look bad.  In other words? Most of the time, good defense is more important than good goaltending. And its also great for the goalie's confidence and mental game. Even if your down, you know you can come back.  Giguère is good enough and is used to playing alot of games.  We need some solid stay at home defense men with stamina. Especially when we are protecting leads."
457226,JohnF,2010-04-17 22:54:00,3494," He played 12 more game as well. It definitely helps to play all season with the top scorer in the NHL and his not too shabby brother as well. No way of knowing how Kessel might have done in those circumstances.  Kessel's not much of a passer yet, and he sure isn't a mucker, but he sure can control the puck in the offensive zone, and if he gets one guys who can bully their way into the slot he might just start to rack up some pretty good pointage. As for the hitting, if he can collect points I'll settle for a hitter as strong as Gretzky was.  JF"
457469,Paulus,2010-04-18 16:17:00,522,"Kessel is what he is: a proven, young scorer who in all probability will score consistently for the Leafs for the foreseeable future. That, and a reasonable expectation that his presence might fast-track the rebuild, were the prime motivations for the Kessel trade.  Don't get me wrong, as much as I like Kessel, I wasn't overly enthused when I heard about the trade. But as has been said, I don't think that Burke expected to provide the Bruins with a top two draft pick this year. Then again, imo he must have considered the possibility of it. I'm also not so sure that he didn't provide the Bruins with a top ten pick next year, despite having put down a solid foundation for future improvement.  The risk lies not only in how high the draft picks go, but what those players eventually do. If Boston gets two or even just one frachise-type player out of the deal, then Toronto clearly loses on the trade, since Kessel is not really a franchise player; but that has yet to be seen, and it's a tall order. To judge the trade as a bust now is unfair to the player we got, and it's needlessly pessimistic because...  Even if we lose the Kessel trade, we still got a guy who's going to score regularly for this team year-in year-out. He fits into the plan that Burke is implementing (despite his on-ice lack of truculence). Let's just enjoy the ride and see how it all pans out.    p.-"

456076,Rizzo,2010-04-14 22:47:00,4754," I don't follow hockey too closely but as a casual observer I'm not so sure about this statement. The leafs I remember from the last 5 years would be in the playoff hunt right up until the end, usually missing out in the final week (or even final night?). This year they were not even close, and can't even take consolation in a high draft pick. How is this admirable? They are worse than they have been in years and don't even have draft picks to rebuild with."
456077,Jigger,2010-04-14 22:48:00,1237,"The way I see it, Kadri is absolutely tearing it up in the Knights playoffs. He was voted by his peers as equal to or exceeding Hall and or Seguin in many facets of the game. If memory serves me correctly, The draft day deal last year that would have seen Kessel come to the Leafs included the Leafs pick(Kadri was the player) and Kaberle. Would you have done that deal? I wouldn't. Burke had every reason to doubt that he was trading a 1st or 2nd overall pick. So they still have a great bargaining chip in Kaberle, a very highly rated prospect in Kadri and a proven 21yr 30 goal guy in Kessel. I'd say Bozak was a good outside aquisition as well."
456078,moose,2010-04-14 22:48:00,266,"dont you guys remember boston wanting kaberle and whos to say that burke wont trade for one of these pics their already talking about trades and dumping salaries to make room for new aquistions , burke is a very smart man and the bandwagon people are phenomlell if leafs made playoffs and did well you guys would all say burke is a hero just like you all did with fletcher sorry to burst all your bubbles but thats the way it is"
456081,Rizzo,2010-04-14 22:54:00,4754," if that's true, Burke can not evaluate talent because this team clearly is very bad. I didn't doubt for a moment they would finish near the bottom...maybe something to do with the fact the team was full of 3rd, 4th or really, 5th line players. Stajan is your number 1 centre??? you are a bad team."
456086,solopaddler,2010-04-14 23:13:00,8605,"  Change doesn't come overnight. He's rebuilt the defense, improved the goaltending dramtically imo, and releived the team of many of contractual millstones.  As mentioned they're now the youngest team in the league.  Overall team speed is the best I've seen in years.  Seriously, considering what he had to work with since taking over he's worked wonders.  Unlike other years where they've placed their hopes on overpriced and over the hill vets at least this time they're rebuilding with youth.  In my eyes it's waay more of a positive plan than what we as Leaf fans have seen in the past.  Personally I'm optimistic."
456105,Rizzo,2010-04-15 00:02:00,4754," this idea I like (although Giguere is old and overpaid but we dumped an overpaid guy in getting him). Not sure if they were smart enough to figure this out or if the salary cap forced them into it. Either way, I'm glad the days of Krushelnyski's and Larry Murphy's and Jason Allison's are over!"
456164,jediangler,2010-04-15 01:47:00,1923,"Kadri is golfing thanks to the Kitchener Rangers putting out London, he'll get a chance to golf with all the other Leafs now. If he makes the team next year, you know Boston will be getting another high pick in the draft."
456234,ADB,2010-04-15 04:43:00,444, That's logical.
456497,Jigger,2010-04-15 21:39:00,1237,"Yeah, I guess if the Leaf draft pick is on the team and they get beat by a better team, it must mean that the player sucks.    Weird how that works.  Good thing Chiarelli is such a wizard throwing all that money at Derek Morris and Michael Ryder. They really covered the goals Kessel would've potted. If it werent for Rask, they would have the first two picks in this years draft."
456559,JoeG,2010-04-16 00:24:00,5,
456560,JoeG,2010-04-16 00:24:00,5,"  Burke had nothing to do with Rask. I think that was either Quinn or Ferguson. They thought they had the next coming of Terry Sawchuk in Pogge and got rid of Rask for Raycroft. Stempniak was invisible here on most nights.  It was as if he didn't want to be here and who could blame him.  I've told most of my buddies this, there hasn't been a flop in a first overall pick in a while.  Won't find out until either Hall or Seguin play but they could possibly be the next Alexandre Daigle. You guys remember him? Then ask yourself if was worth it."
456570,Rizzo,2010-04-16 00:57:00,4754,"  true, but they could also be the next Lecavalier, Sundin, Malkin, Staal etc etc etc There are more success stories from top picks than failures I would think. Rather than comparing the pick to a monumental bust, wouldn't it make sense to just look at the last 10 years and see who went 2nd over-all? Unfortunately I'm far too lazy to look up who went 2nd lately, although i would imagine there are some pretty good players in that mix. Whoever those guys turn out to be, double their value since next years pick will be a good pick too barring some miracle (free agents coming for half price?)"
456631,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-16 04:20:00,0," you could easily say the same thing about kadri.  truth is we won't know until 5 years from now, but if burke's rushed approach to rebuilding a team doesn't pan out, the kessel trade will be looked at as the achilles heel of the latest version of the maple leafs.  no doubt the leafs will be better next season, but if they don't make the playoffs then the burke era will be regarded as a monumental failure."
456655,solopaddler,2010-04-16 10:42:00,8605, Forget Daigle. Any of you Habs fans remember Doug Wickenheiser? I believe they passed on Dennis Savard to pick this guy. LOL!     I believe the Leafs will be much better next year.  I wonder what spot Kessel would be drafted this year if he was magically eligible?  He may very well go first overall.  The guy is still a kid and is a proven commodity.
456723,ADB,2010-04-16 15:24:00,444,"  Thank you Mike for the commonsense, for it has been lacking in some of the other posts."
456826,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-16 20:31:00,0,"It's not a lack of common sense, it's a lack of faith in selling the farm for a quick fix.  Most of the top teams in the salary cap nhl that are succeeding did so by building up depth in the farm, not chasing free agents.  No one doubts the talent of Phil Kessel. My personal doubts are that he's worth TWO first rounders and a 2nd round, especially when you're giving away the 2nd pick overall.  Since you guys want to wave the Burke banner so much, what will you do if the leafs finish 9th or worse in the East next year?  Burke claims this isn't a 5 year rebuild, and last season claimed that you would be competing for the playoffs.  Instead you finished worse.  So who lacks common sense?"
456827,jediangler,2010-04-16 20:41:00,1923,"I'm sure the Leaf fans love affair with Kessel will end after another season. Take it from someone who has watched him for two years before he came to Toronto. He has one move, shoot it through the legs of the defence. He won't go into the so called ""dirty areas"", he won't take a hit to make a play, he won't throw a hit to save his life, he is not a team first kind of guy and if Wilson ever benches him for being selfish, he'll be demanding a trade within the week. Didn't any of you Leaf fans wonder why he couldn't score a goal in 6 games against the Bruins? If you play him physically, he disappears. Be happy with what you got from him this season because it will be his most productive one as a Leaf. I figure next year he'll miss 30 games or more with injuries. He looks good playing on the Leafs because the rest of the team are college players that never got drafted. This is probably one of the best trades ever made by a Bruins GM, next to Barry Pederson to Vancouver for Cam Neely and 3 first round picks."
456830,ADB,2010-04-16 20:55:00,444," Look, when I heard the Leafs had got Kessel, I said, ""if they gave up two firsts, it may not be a good deal.""  What I find ludacris is the opinion that #1) Burke's rebuild has failed, considering he spent the better part of a year getting rid of the team than so many Leaf-haters loved to bash, and #2) that Phil Kessel is somehow worse than draft picks who haven't played a game in the NHL yet.  I won't even get into the statement that Kadri will somehow make the team worse next year...  If Seguin/Hall turn out to be better then Kessel, than I'll be the first to admit it was a bad trade, but I think most people don't truly understand how rare it is to find a player who can score 30 goals with their eyes closed."
456831,solopaddler,2010-04-16 20:57:00,8605,"  Obviously Burke didn't think they'd finish this low. If he had any clue he wouldn't have made the trade.  However as far as I'm concerned if the Leafs are strong next year he still wins the trade.  He's already proven he's able to find young talent elsewhere besides the draft (Bozak, Gustavson, Hanson)."
456843,ADB,2010-04-16 21:08:00,444," I'm sure than Boston is the only team in the league that played Kessel physically and knows about his ""only move""...give me a break.  He must have scored 30 goals by fluke then.  It's funny how the tune of Boston fans can change so fast.  When Kessel was drafted you would've thought that the Bruins had the second-coming of Gretzky.  Boston fans make it seem like they wanted to trade Kessel.  Please.  The only reason he was traded is because Boston wouldn't give him the money he wanted because they were bound by the cap, and then the Leafs came along with a deal they couldn't refuse.  Notice how Boston went from 1st in the East in 2009/2009 to 6th in 2009/2010?  I wonder why that happened... 276 to 204 goals? I wonder why that happened...  In terms of Kessel being injured, he missed 30 games over four years, which I'd say is pretty decent.  And what injuries has he had? 2006:  testicular cancer.  What a testament to his durability...the idiot just had to go out and get cancer...2008/2009: Mono...he must have a pretty bad immune system I guess...2009/2010:  Missed games after shoulder surgery...big deal, most NHL players have had at least one surgery.  He's not Eric Lindros personified, or the Vince Carter of hockey.  You would think the fact that he scored 30 goals with college players would make him a better player?  I don't know, that seems logical to me.  What were all the Leafs-haters saying after they got him?  ""Oh, without Savard dishing him the puck he'll be nothing.""  Well, he still managed to score 30 goals in 70 games with virtual nothings playing centre for him.  Don't get me wrong, Phil Kessel isn't Sydney Crosby, or Alex Ovechkin, but the endless bashing of his play and character, to me, is ridiculous."
456849,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-16 21:15:00,0,"  I agree with this to an extent. If the leafs can outperform the bruins over the next 2 seasons he won the trade.  But if the bruins become a dominant force or worse yet win a cup, burke should ask for some sort of royalties from boston."
456850,JohnF,2010-04-16 21:15:00,3494, Jeez. I'll betcha Burkey is really sorry he didn't consult with you before making that trade.  JF
456880,solopaddler,2010-04-16 21:58:00,8605, I have no problems with Burke. He's a smart man and not afraid to make a bold move when necessary.  I will however never forgive JFJ for giving Rask to the Bruins.
456931,Dutchy,2010-04-17 00:44:00,416," Well, you quote me over the page, but I didn't bash him. I simply maintain he is not worth the draft picks they gave up for him even if he does score 30 goals. Burke said he would not trade draft picks away and its the first thing he did. I'll give you Kessel is young, but you will need way more than him to become contenders. Kessel is a solid player, but when you start comparing him...... top teams have 4 or even 5 players who have more points than him. If you change the players surrounding him will he become better? Only time will tell."
455754,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-14 05:09:00,0,So uhhhhhh... Is he the best GM the Bruins have ever had? 
455755,solopaddler,2010-04-14 05:26:00,8605," I like the job he's done with the Leafs so far. Considering what he had to work with he's done an admirable job. Youngest team in the league now. Some good young building blocks in Bozak, Kessel, Phaneuf, Kulemin and Gustavson.  As far as the trade Burke made, there's certainly no guarantee that Boston's pick will be better than a 21 year old Phil Kessel.  The trade that really ticks me off as a Leaf fan is JFJ sending Rask to Boston for ....shudder.....Ranford."
455764,Lunatic,2010-04-14 08:33:00,536,"This.    I like burke. and i think he has done a great job having to fix the years for crap JFJ has created. we are or were up to this year i believe still paying for raycroft and tucker. as for tyler and taylor does anyone remember pat faloon or yashin? im not saying that will happen with those 2,but one never knows. and kessel is already proven to be a 30+ a year scorer"
455765,SlowPoke,2010-04-14 09:11:00,2984,"I like Burke and can't stand Wilson. (I tell anyone that will listen) The Kessel trade was good. Proven 30 goal scorer, twice. Scoring 30 goals on this Leaf team is miraculous and considering he missed 15-20 games coming back from the injury is incredible. The only way this trade gets any better is if the Leafs placed higher in the standings and the ""B's"" pick 6,7 or 8th. That's Wilson's fault  Now, say what you will about Burke but keep in mind who orchestrated getting rid of seemingly untradeable players; Toskala and Blake."
455771,Paully,2010-04-14 11:06:00,712,Boston got the number 2 pick..
455775,Lunatic,2010-04-14 11:24:00,536,"To add a little bit of optimism ,at least our 3rd round pick will be good haha. and form what ive heard,next years draft is supposedly the worst or most shallow draft in years to come,so losing that 1st round pick may not be so terrible. also i was told that dave nonis said ""we will be suprised how low the leafs will pick this year"" so im going to assume some deal is in the works for a lower pick/trade this draft. i just hope they trade kaberle for a top forward (center) and not a pick."
455782,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-14 11:49:00,0,"  I like Burke too.  He's a man of integrity and is well respected by players.  But he didn't just surrender this years pick.  They gave up their first round pick and their second round pick this year, AND their first round pick in 2011.  Once can presume now that Boston gets a player of all star caliber this season, and at a minimum 2 rosters player.   Kessel better score more than 30 goals.  I assume the leafs will be a better squad this year, but they've made Boston, an already solid team WAY better.  I"
455802,JohnF,2010-04-14 12:47:00,3494,Burke has created a team that's more fun to watch than anything TO fans have had in a while imnsho. Both he and Wilson rip off some pretty funny interviews so that's entertaining. And I'm more impressed with the team they finished this season with than any I've seen in more than a few years.  As for draft picks I think I'd still rather have Phil than one of the unknowns. With him the coach starts with a certain 30 goal scorer and irons out the little problems. With a high draft pick you really don't know if you're getting a Stamkos or just another trader.  JF
455804,GBW,2010-04-14 12:50:00,8460,"Best point so far.  Who's to say any of this years top 10 picks will score 30 or more in a season?  Even more so, back to back."
455815,Fang,2010-04-14 13:29:00,1330,name 1 Leafs draft pick from the last 10 years to have back to back 30 goal season
455819,Paulus,2010-04-14 13:57:00,522," That's a good point.  But if you look at Burke's overall record just this year, there's no doubt that his efforts are honest and effective.  Would you ever have suggested to him that he NOT make the pre-Olympics trades that brought Phaneuf, Giguère and Sjostrom to T.O.? The only player I lament in those deals was Ian White - but then who would you rather have? White or Phaneuf??? You have to pay a price.  The trade to get Blake and Toskala out of town was awesome. I couldn't believe it when I heard about it. Other than being a cap hit, it's a complete and total on-ice win for the Leafs. It's a trade I'd make every day, twice on Sunday, ten times on Monday.  The loss of two high-end draft picks - especially in view of how bad they'd be if they didn't have Kessel (so they'd be close to last in the league again next year) - hurts. But Kessel is a known commodity and can score now.  So, when you add all this up, there's no doubt that Burke is executing a plan, and a good plan. We haven't seen this many good trades in Toronto since the Gilmour trade in 92!  p.-"
455833,anders,2010-04-14 14:34:00,1168,"Kulemin and Gustavson are restricted free agents this summer and will require a raise, and Jonas earned it, so the leafs will have to pay up, which could eat up some valuable salary, and Kulemin is coming out of his rookie contract and will be asking for some more money...trading Kaberle will help, however if they want a top line player with Kessel that too will eat salary and not really put them in any better position."
455865,bucktail,2010-04-14 15:40:00,1857,"Looks like I am in the minority here. I think Burke is a HORRIBLE GM . He seems to be building a team for yesterday and not tomorrow. Size over skill. His aquistions have been marginal at best. Beauchemin has been exposed as a overly priced defenceman , Leaving the side of Neidermeyer has exposed his lack of skills. The trade for Kessel I would understand if this was 3 years from now but if you are going to rebuild you keep that pick and have a chance at Taylor Hall or Tyler Seguin. if you are rebuilding you do it thru the draft! But then again the Leafs have the worst scouts in the NHL so maybe he doesnt have any choice. Trading Kaberle will be the worst thing they do, none of there present D possess puck movement skills to get the puck out of there own end. A goaltender that has a bad heart, hence the reason he wasnt drafted. Jeff Finger ( You paid what for whom? ) this was an actual headline on ESPN after this aquisition!!!  Phanuef hopefully works out buut his stock has fallen over the last few years as he has been showing more and more defensive liabilities. I ope playing under a bigger microscope helps and doesnt hurt his game.  Same for Giguere , his numbers have been sliding very badly over the last few years , maybe a change of scenery can reignite his game. If not you have a 33 year old goalie and one with a bad ticker....not good after you had Rask  ill give him credit for Bozak and Stalberg, some potential there, but that is over shadowed by good players th.ey have let go like Stempniak and Rask.  There only chance is to rebuild thru trades which the Maple Leafs have tried for 40 yeaars ( we seen how that works) No draft picks , no future.  But what does it matter, winning is not important to the worst team in North American sports....just the bottom line as lemmings file thru the gate to watch Junior B hockey!"

Even if you don't like him, I think he is interesting to listen to. In regards to the Kessel deal he used an analogy of 2 framers arguing about what crop had just been planted. The gist is that arguing/debating about some subjects is pointless and that in time the answer will be apparent. The Kessel/ draft picks can't be properly evaluated until 15 or so years from now."
455899,kickingfrog,2010-04-14 16:53:00,8333,"A point of note for a few of the above.  A first round pick is not the 1st pick overall.  The first pick overall for a team is not necessarily a 1st round pick.  There are lies, damn lies and the then there are statistics."
455912,Dutchy,2010-04-14 17:16:00,416, What he said. I agree. Giving away the first round pick blew up in Burke's face. Kessel is not worth the no.2 pick overall. Not what he had in mind at all.
455918,Grimace,2010-04-14 17:33:00,2020,"Burke thought he was giving away a 10-16 pick this year and a 19-22 pick next year.  Along with the second rounder.  The leafs crapped the bed.  He did a nice job of clearing house though.  I still have optimism for Burke.  I like him.  This Kessel deal might define him though.  Kessel is what he is, don't expect him to gain tremendously, he is playing to his potential.  He needs a Centre and a winger.  He does not make anyone around him any better.  That being said I like Kessel.  I just don't like what we gave up.  I like Burke.  I wll give him a B- so far.  It might be less if it wasn't him"
455922,jediangler,2010-04-14 17:44:00,1923,"I love what Burke is doing, of course I'm a Bruins fan and will be looking forward to another high pick next year courtesy of the Leafs. Burke said today that he's not looking to change anything on the defensive end. The Leafs allowed the 2nd most goals in the league as well as had the worst PK and worst PP in the league. The last team to finish last in those two categories was also coached by Ron Wilson. The goalies he's keeping were ranked 29th and 39th in the league. It's almost as if he believes that the hopes and dreams of Leafs nation alone will improve the team. Good luck with that."
455929,anders,2010-04-14 17:56:00,1168,"  I will third this...hit the nail on the head exactly...as well with Kaberle...he may be getting old but he moves the puck like one of the best for d-men in the league...look at any successfull team on the PP...they have a puck moving dman...if they move him, fans and leaf brass will only soon be saying ""we only need a puck moving dman"".  The guy is an offencive jugernaught on a crap team...that is one guy you KEEP!  OR if you guys wish...trade him to Boston for Thomas...we'll take him!"
455932,JohnF,2010-04-14 17:58:00,3494,"Hockey teams and their fans are like husbands and wives. Not everyone understands what some husbands see in their wives, and vice versa, but the fact remains that we each have our own loves no matter what others think. Now if some guy said the kind of things he says in reference to my hockey team when he was talking about my wife I'd have to rip him a new anal orifice. Fortunately we're much more easy going about our hockey teams.  JF"
456015,ADB,2010-04-14 21:14:00,444," Do you know anything about hockey or the Leafs?  Obviously not considering your original post bashing Burke contained moves that were done before he even got there.  Jiri Tlusty was a flop, fine.  But how many other guys from that draft were flops?  Tlusty was taken 13th overall.  Out of the 17 guys taken after him in the first round, 6 have yet to play a game in the NHL...at least Tlusty has.  Dale Mitchell is only 21, for one.  Secondly, he was a third round draft pick.  Not many game-breakers come from the third round.  Three players from the third round that year have even played in the NHL yet...and they've combined for a whopping 13 games.  Luke Schenn is only in his second season of NHL hockey, and many would consider him a solid defenseman.  Nazem Kadri has only played one NHL game.  Good job judging him before he's had a chance to even make the team.  Let's look at who they have drafted in the last little while...  The goalie you speak so highly of, Tuuka Rask, drafted by Toronto.   2007: Didn't have a 1st or a 2nd round pick, yet managed to draft defenseman Carl Gunnarsson in the 7th round, who is looking like a solid NHL player. 2006: Drafted Kulemin in the 2nd round.  He looks pretty good to me.  He has turned out to be, by far the best player taken in that 2nd round, besides Milan Lucic of Boston. 2005: The goalie you speak so highly of, Tuuka Rask, drafted by Toronto.  Anton Stralman, a good NHL defenseman, drafted by Toronto in the 7th round, 216th overall in 2005.  Only two other players taken in the 7th round that year have played in the NHL. 2004:  Didn't have a first or second round pick. 2002:  Matt Stajan, a player who never got much respect in Toronto, was drafted in the second round.  Of those second round picks, he has played the most games, and amassed the most points, even though he was drafted late in the round.  How about Ian White?  He was taken in the sixth round, and he is a solid NHL defenseman.  I could go on like his.  The point is:  Toronto has done so ""poorly"" in the draft in the last 10 years because they have had a history of trading away their top picks.  It is pretty hard to draft ""game breakers"" when you don't have picks in the top 30 or even the top 60.  It's pretty easy to draft a guy like Ovechkin, Crosby, Malkin, Stamkos, etc when they're staring you in the face.  Toronto has done pretty well with the picks they have had.  Ignorant people or Toronto-haters won't see that because they're content on just talking out of their behinds."
456022,ADB,2010-04-14 21:23:00,444," Hockey is about buying low and selling high.  Kaberle is a great player...but, I'm sorry, great defenseman don't play on teams with the worst PP in the league, no matter how ""bad"" the forwards are.  However, he does have a lot of value right now, mostly because of his low salary.  Every year that goes by his value will get lower and lower.  He is the only player on the team that can bring back a good return.  Signing him to an extension won't be an option considering the money he'll want, the length of the contract, and the already crowded blueline."
456027,ADB,2010-04-14 21:26:00,444," Kessel is not worth the second pick overall?  I will take a guaranteed 30+ goal scorer (coming off surgery and with a poor team) over the ""potential"" of most high draft picks...especially this year!  This isn't a Crosby or Ovechkin year people...this is the worst draft year in a while, and therefore, the perfect time to take the risk of trading those picks."
