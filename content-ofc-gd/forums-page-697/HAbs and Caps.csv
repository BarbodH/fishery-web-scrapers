457440,JohnF,2010-04-18 14:26:00,3494, As long as the hometown crowd stays behind them. Habs fans can be kinda fickle. It doesn't pay to make one mistake in front of them. That brings out the boobirds. I feel sorry for the Habs players sometimes. Montreal could learn a lot about fan loyalty from Toronto but that'll never happen.  JF
457445,jediangler,2010-04-18 14:50:00,1923,"I would say that Leaf fans could learn a lot from Montreal fans. When you pay big money for a ticket and the show is sub-par, you have every right to let the team know how you feel."
457447,JohnF,2010-04-18 14:58:00,3494, Seems to me it would make more sense if you don't like your team any more to quit paying the exorbitant ticket prices instead. I'll go back to my marriage analogy. Once you start booing and mocking your spouse perhaps that's the time to call it quits and find a new love who better measures up to your demanding standards. Toronto fans are loyal. They just keep cheering for the old shoe and revel in the small improvements. One day the Leafs will get to the top again and their fans will be the happiest people in the hockey world. All loyal fans deserve success but none more than the Toronto fans.  JF
457450,jediangler,2010-04-18 15:07:00,1923,If you want a marriage analogy....Why does divorce cost so much?  Because it's worth it.
457470,JohnF,2010-04-18 16:36:00,3494, I'll have to take yer word for that. Never got to try it. Probably won't now.  JF
457473,Northhunter,2010-04-18 16:44:00,214," Yes and no. Toronto fans are jaded. They are probably one of the reasons the leafs had been mis-managed for so long. They could finish last in the east for the next 5 years, and still sell out every game. When the executives know that money will roll in no matter what.. does that really help the team?"
457476,Northhunter,2010-04-18 16:50:00,214," Ticket prices are exorbitant in Toronto.  There was a bit of a riff after last season in Montreal, with team members and media calling out certain members of their fan base. A lot of the booing and harassment was coming from the riff-raff in the ""Molson Ex Zone"" or whatever they call it (ie; the cheap seats). ""Riff-raff"" was not the term that was used lol."
457277,bigugli,2010-04-18 01:37:00,6138,What a wild game. Love it.
457281,Mike the Pike,2010-04-18 01:45:00,3421,Its offence tonite not goaltending.Biting the nails right now going into OT.
457283,misfish,2010-04-18 01:46:00,29133,"Im a habs fan,,,,,,,,NOW  Barrie colts have woken up.3-1 in the 3rd."
457284,addymark,2010-04-18 01:46:00,69,can the habs go home up 2-0?  that would be something.
457285,brifishrgy,2010-04-18 01:47:00,559,good game so far .. refs suck like usual .. its amazing what they will call a penalty and what they wont .. you can rake the goalie out of the net but cant check a player who played the puck (Gill on Semin) .. 2 refs on the ice and they are still clueless .. lets hope for a good OT
457286,Stoty,2010-04-18 01:47:00,2910,This is a crazy game! VERY entertaining!!  Cant wait to see who comes out on top!
457291,JohnF,2010-04-18 01:49:00,3494,"How did lowly Toronto ever beat this team in the season final? Montreal had their backs to the wall and still couldn't win, yet here they are hanging right in there with the Caps. There's no logic to this game any more.  JF"
457292,Dutchy,2010-04-18 01:51:00,416, No theres not   Go Habs  That was quick. Go nucks lol.
457293,Mike the Pike,2010-04-18 01:54:00,3421,were gone its over.They blew a good lead.Oh well I am thinking more about fishing.
457294,brifishrgy,2010-04-18 01:54:00,559,hope the refs got a caps jersey out of the deal
457296,misfish,2010-04-18 01:55:00,29133,"Blinked and I missed it. ,"
457297,Dondorfish,2010-04-18 01:56:00,1000,"Look for Price to start in Montreal - couple of weak goals against Halek, including the winner."
457302,PikeMolester,2010-04-18 02:15:00,428,I hope you are joking...he sniped it through the D-man's LEGS! it was a crazy shot. Maybe the tying one was bad but not the winner. I think we just blew the series and lost ALL momentum. Watch the CAPS smoke us every game now.
457304,Whitespinnerbait,2010-04-18 02:21:00,2038,Now that the Habs lost the game.....I'm going to sleep like a Baby tonight...
457307,misfish,2010-04-18 02:24:00,29133,"NO NO NO,,,,,WAY.  It,s a great series so far.Dont count the habs out."
457316,Leecher,2010-04-18 02:37:00,7832,I don't know about you guys but them refs missed some pretty obvious penalties and did not call them    Going to MTL a 1-1 tie... It's a good thing!!! Leechman
457324,PikeMolester,2010-04-18 02:52:00,428,If you told me we were coming here 1-1 against washington 2 weeks ago I would be super happy. But I would have rather lost 3-0 tonight than blow a 4-1 lead like that. p.s. I knew whitespinner was gonna come in here after I post and make a yikes comment.
457332,Leecher,2010-04-18 03:05:00,7832, Yeah I know     he's a Sens fan
457420,jediangler,2010-04-18 13:50:00,1923,Don't lose hope Habs fans. It's a 5 game series now and Montreal has home ice advantage.
457429,Northhunter,2010-04-18 14:04:00,214,"It was sad to see them lose the 3 goal lead and then go ahead again near the end, only to lose... but I'm happy that if they were gonna lose that they lost the way they did - maybe taught them a lesson. Halak is good but when he's seeing that many quality shots from outside the slot, some are bound to find their way.  I agree with the reffing - Gill on Semin was a brutal call. Seemed like they were trying to give Bettman's prized U.S. market team an advantage near the end... but they wouldn't do that, would they??  Back to Montreal - interesting to see how the habs come out with the home crowd behind them!"
457433,Northhunter,2010-04-18 14:13:00,214," That's why they play the game  Montreal never seems to bring their ""A"" game for Toronto. No matter how good/bad the leafs happen to be playing when they meet. Huet used to choke every time he saw a blue and white jersey. Maybe the pressure gets to them.. I dunno."
457435,JohnF,2010-04-18 14:14:00,3494," I didn't see it that way. I thought the caps just finally got their act kinda together. The way the refs were calling things that game was bound to be topsy turvy anyway. I realize there's a lot to watch for the refs and linesmen but they really should concentrate on the game part of the scenery. Some of those calls sure looked like ""oopsy"" calls, the kind they make to compensate for a blown call earlier. Like the one they missed that would have stopped the play just before Montreal got called and the caps scored in the delay. Then the Caps were given a Bull penalty right after that. I didn't think it quite made up for the goal though.  Missed calls are to be expected but I hate when they affect the outcome of the game.  JF"
457436,JohnF,2010-04-18 14:17:00,3494, That's a coincidence. There seems to be a few folks here who gag just at the mention of the leafs.  JF
457438,JohnF,2010-04-18 14:21:00,3494," That was a helluva game to watch, even when you don't really care who wins. I guess that's the test of quality hockey though, huh? I've been a Leafs fan too long to switch loyalty to the Habs just cuz Toronto's out, but I really can't stand Ovechkin and his crap. He's a great player, one of the best I've ever watched, but he's a jackass in my books. He's one of the guys i enjoy seeing stumble.  JF"
457439,Daplumma,2010-04-18 14:24:00,1961,My beloved Caps have not looked good since the break.I hope they have finally got it together with this comeback.Rod Langway had the best quote about poor refereeing after a game we lost to a bad call in the late 80's.When the reporter asked about the poor call Rod said that it was our fault for letting the game get that close that a ref's bad call would make a difference.A true leader of the team.
