456975,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-17 02:23:00,10439,"On my float rods I run green or grey 12# Raven, casting rods get 12# silver thread and 15# power pro on the bottom bouncing rig."

457113,rapala14,2010-04-17 17:13:00,44,"I use Trilene XT (preferably in clear) for throwin hardware (kiwik fish/flatfish, spinners, spoons etc).  Great knot strength, super abrasion resistant just an all round great line.  Haven't tried the super braids for steelheadin yet.  Probably should give it a shot haha"
457114,Paully,2010-04-17 17:16:00,712,8 - 10 lb clear line..
457172,kickingfrog,2010-04-17 20:26:00,8333,I'm a hardware steelheader and traditionally for me it's been 6lb or 8lb mono depending on the rod and condition. For the last 2 years I've had a spool of 15lb braid in my vest that I haven't yet pulled out to try. Maybe this year.
