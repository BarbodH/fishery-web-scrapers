I go for my morning smoke and come back in the house and tell her ""no, the weather sucks and I'm not ready"".  So she books off for a 15KM run thinking by time she gets back the weather will be better.  Sure enough it's snowing...  So she send me into town to pick stuff up for the day that we missed so we can get going. It's now 9:00 AM and my kid's are going nuts asking to get going because they have things to do later ( at 6 and 3 what plans do they have   ) So needless to say I got both kids room painted just in time to post this crappie report..."
