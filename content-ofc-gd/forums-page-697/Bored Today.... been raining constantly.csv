Heres what I ended up with    Another shot of the three of them closely bunch    The three of them overlayed    Quite an undertaking in the making..... about 6 - 7 hours    but was finally able to use them and make the cutouts with the jig saw, painting.... Haven't drilled the holes yet but will certainly work on that if this rain persist  Anyhow here's what I've been able to achieve so far    Still some work to be done and kind of like this one   will keep you posted on the development.
