Managed a couple fish along with plenty of suckers.  first fish on the new pin       thought somethin was odd about this sucker, cant put my finger on it though. it hit a chartreuse worm that i was fishing shallow cause i didnt want anymore suckers but it came up and took the worm, also had a pointier nose than all the other suckers i caught.   i also caught a 3 inch minnow on the same worm... somehow.. "
456974,Jet,2010-04-17 02:23:00,364,Nice stuff man on the new pin. I'm sure it'll get a good workout this weekend.
456981,NAC,2010-04-17 02:29:00,369,"nice bows.  I have the same reel and like it a lot, especially the weight and price. should hooked that minnow on right under the dorsal....  seriously!"
456983,MJL,2010-04-17 02:35:00,2427,Nicely done Mark...I've caught a fair number of those pointy nose suckers from western Lake O tribs...Ironically I've never caught from eastern tribs  I've become a course fish connoisseur over the years trying to catch as many species of suckers as I can.LOL  You still have your black loomis pin?
456984,l2p,2010-04-17 02:36:00,346,"yeah the reel is awsome, its exactly what i thought it would be before i bought it. i reeled in my line and the minnow was just on my hook lol."
456988,l2p,2010-04-17 02:40:00,346,haha knew it! that sucker is from the west sidee lol. i caught it at an east trib it had a different colouration from the rest of the suckers plus those dots on its tail... wierd.  i sold that pin yeaaars ago... wish i never did tbh. i still have my black sst and have decided not to let it go.
457022,Spiel,2010-04-17 10:49:00,9065,"Dem's some nice bright looking steelies.  This one appears to be a Longnose Sucker and would you believe I don't ever recall catching one in the western Ontario tribs but they're numerous in Georgian Bay and Lake Huron tribs. Up that way they're often referred to as Mullet, don't ask me why.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longnose_Sucker  "
457099,l2p,2010-04-17 15:57:00,346,"Cool, thanks for the info. I knew there were several different species of suckers around. my first thought was a redhorse sucker but i dont think so now.. it had redish sides cant really tell from pic and it fought ALOT harder than any old regular sucker, this thing went up down sidways just like a bulldogging steelie exept it wasnt haha"
457108,frozen-fire,2010-04-17 16:47:00,542,That's a nice looking sucker. Nice long finnage!
