456347,Musky or Specks,2010-04-15 15:30:00,2710,I dont ask for much info here but Im avoiding crowds opening weekend of trout and am taking my son and my buddy is taking his son out for some crappie on Kashe Lake. Vaguely familiar with the lake but all the info I can get(PM'd of coarse) would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance MorS
456370,Michael_Brown,2010-04-15 16:05:00,411,"I have tried crappie in the spring a few times on Kashe. I have still not found them. I found sunfish, perch, pike and just about everything else but no crappie yet. Main basin area around the boat launch should be good. I have tried the lower end near the river from bass lk. No luck. Try finding any little back bays out of the wind. Warm water should rule.  Good Luck and let me know if you find any."

457384,musky66,2010-04-18 11:57:00,273,"As I remember, the lake is not that large- think there is a north, and south access road. Maybe drive them and see what you can find. I remember one for sure at a resort of some sort. Pretty sure I've seen a fishing show about panfish from Kashe in the past."
