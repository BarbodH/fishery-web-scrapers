456649,singingdog,2010-04-16 10:17:00,1047,"Do us all a favor and get a 4 stroke. 2 stroke outboard motors are small pollutions machines, both in terms of emissions and (more importantly) in terms of the amount of oil they are allowing into the water."
456662,craigdritchie,2010-04-16 11:27:00,1586,"Nice motor, but you never will see another one like it again. They spew out too much crap (into the air and into the water)  and have been relegated to history. That's just the way it is.  I drive a lot of boats, and I'll tell you, unless you plan to hoist that engine over your head a few times every day, you won't miss it if you upgrade to a four-stroke. What you will notice right away is that you save money by not having to buy oil with every tank of gas. And, the tank of gas goes a much longer way than it ever did with the old Mariner. And, you'll never smell exhaust again. Or see that vulgar little oil slick in the water. Those are things you appreciate on a daily basis. Spec charts are fine for the sake of discussion, but in real-world use, new four-strokes blow away the old gas guzzlers every time."
456671,Mike the Pike,2010-04-16 12:01:00,3421, Wow Craig what an eye opener.Some 2 strokes weighing more than a 4 stroke.I have a Yamaha F60hp 4stroke tiller 237lbs my previous motor was a 50hp Honda only 215lbs.One thing I noticed was my Honda took alot less fuel than the Yamaha but the Yamaha out performs the Honda big time I guess a 3 cylinder vs 4 cylinder makes the difference.I think the difference in weight 4s vs 2s  in the small motors can vary alot more in weight.I swapped  a Honda 7.5hp 4 strike for a Yamaha 8hp 2 stroke for a 12 ft tinny I used to have.carrying the Honda was a chore compared to carrying the 2 stroke yamaha.Anyhoo once you go 4 stroke there is no turning back.
456729,craigdritchie,2010-04-16 15:37:00,1586,"A lot of new four-strokes are way lighter than old two-stroke outboards. Last fall I went to a Yamaha product launch and drove their new F70 .... it's a 70 horsepower four-stroke that is 109 pounds lighter than the engine it replaces. Think about that. I also drove their little F6 portable .... it's a fuel injected, six horsepower four-stroke that weighs a bit less than their old carburated six hp two-stroke. Amazing.  On the west coast, guys are replacing the old inboard engines in their charterboats with big four-stroke outboards, mounted on transom brackets. Gary Cooper, who hosts the ""Nice Fish"" TV show, put a pair of 250 hp Suzuki four-strokes on the back of his 30 foot Slickcraft, and says he reduced his fuel costs by almost 75 percent (he had a pair of 350 V8s). Besides that, now the boat is also about 10 mph faster, and goes father on a tank of gas. It was obviously expensive for him to change two engines, but he says the fuel savings alone will let him get all his money back in three to four years.  Honda just brought out a new 115 four-stroke. I have not driven it yet, but it's supposed to be absolutely incredible. Their old 115 was a really nice engine, so this should be something to see."

456783,doubleheader,2010-04-16 18:00:00,497,"I've been running a 4 stroke since 1998. They were good then they are really really good now. The only possible real world disadvantage I can think of, and that may have even been overcome at this point, is if you plan to take the motor off the transom from time to time you'll want to store it and transport it in an upright position."
456995,John Bacon,2010-04-17 02:58:00,3277," I checked the Legend web site; there is a $2,600 price difference between a 50hp 2 stroke vs. a 50hp 4 stroke.  That is almost $3,000 after taxes and more if you are financing it.  I don't think the average fisherman is going to save money by buying a four stroke."
457005,archie_james_c,2010-04-17 04:12:00,618,  almost doubling your gas mileage isnt considered saving money?
457068,John Bacon,2010-04-17 14:19:00,3277," Yes, but so is spending $3,000 less on the motor in the first place.  When I said that they wouldn't save; I meant that after taking both the price of the motor and the price of gas into consideration they won't come out ahead.  I figure that I spent at most $500-$600 a year to put gas in my 55hp 2 stroke.  If I take interest and time value to money into consideration; a four stroke would never save enough on gas to compensate for the extra three grand on the initial purchase.  Someone who's running their boat eight hours a day for a hundred days a year will probably save with a four stroke; I think the average fisherman will save with a 2 stroke."
457152,Sinker,2010-04-17 19:16:00,8692,"I dunno, at the end of the day, I bet my 2 stroke doesn't burn much more than a 4 stroke. I don't know how much more, or less it does in fact burn, but the cost of gas is the last thing on my mind when it comes to my outboard.  Keep in mind, If I was looking for an outboard over 50HP, I would be looking at 4 strokes for sure. Under 50HP, I'm still a fan of 2 strokes.  S."

Yamaha 9.9 2 stroke This being said, I am a big fan of the 4 strokes.  I've used both the Yamaha 2 and 4 stroke 9.9 models and both are great.  The 4 stroke does use about 30% less gas."
457266,waterwolf,2010-04-18 01:18:00,556,"ofcourse the 4 stroke out-shines the 2 stroke in some ways, given, but what about the workin' stiff who only gets the liberty to burn a couple of tanks of fuel a season in his 12 or 14 foot tinny cause summer is the busy time at work? fuel consumption? not an issue. that higher price tag is now a more difficult justification to a guy who can't get out fishin' as much as he'd like. lower the price and weight and i'll get on board ,, when and if my 2 stroke merc bites it."
457309,John Bacon,2010-04-18 02:28:00,3277, When I was looking for boats last year I was told that 10% of the motors a manufacturer sells do not have to meet the latest standards.  This is why traditional two strokes are still sold.  This is what I was told by the salesman; I didn't bother to verify his comments.  I did check the Legend site though; they still offer two strokes.
455845,ehg,2010-04-14 14:58:00,2666,Recently was talking with a marine dealership owner and i was interested in getting new 9.9 outboard. I thought 4 stroke was the way to go despite the weight. He told me that new 2 strokes are better. All the technology that goes in 4 strokes like fuel injection etc... is going into 2 strokes and eventually the 4 strokes will go the way of the dinosaur. I was surprised at the comments and now confused about future purchase. Looking for more input.
455879,Fisherman,2010-04-14 16:13:00,7201,"Hmmmm, 4 strokes going the way of the dinosaur, well how many 2 stroke land vehicles do you see moving, I think they beat the dinosaurs and 2 stroke outboards will more likely end up there.  AFAIK there are already areas in the country that don't allow 2 strokes, regardless of the new technology.  I'd rather put up with a bit of weight instead of the ring ting ting rattle shake shake of a 2 stroke."
455883,Tybo,2010-04-14 16:23:00,1373,Sounds to me is this dealership bought to many 2 strokes and can't get rid of them.

If your gonna remove the motor on a regular basis for whatever reason i would go with the 2-stroke just for the ease of carrying the thing"

456029,Big Cliff,2010-04-14 21:27:00,6899,"On a smaller engine like that I would go with the 2 stroke. The new technology makes them very fuel efficient, they are lighter weight, and have more low end power. They travel better too if they are going to be left in a position other than upright.

456235,ohhenrygsr,2010-04-15 04:55:00,947,"Well i know for a fact that, for a Merc the 2-Stroke is the way of the fossil.  Mercury has stopped production of all conventional 2-stroke's but they still make Optimax.  So the four strokes are the way of the future.  Cleaner for the environment, quieter, better on gas, no smoke and weight wise it's about 85Lbs a 2-stroke will come in about 10-15lbs lighter.  If you go to the Merc website 2-stroke's aren't even listed anymore."
456251,craigdritchie,2010-04-15 11:15:00,1586,"I will guarantee that the dealer who told you this is either (1) an Evinrude dealer, or (2) a sucker who has a shed full of OLD engines he's desperately looking to unload. Shop around, because you need to hear the reality from a few other dealers.  Four-strokes are the future. This is why every major manufacturer out there (with the exception of Evinrude, and Merc with their OptiMax line) has stopped manufacturing two-stroke engines altogether. Oh yes - that and the fact that as of January 1, they can't sell non-DFI two-strokes to dealers any more because they don't comply with pollution laws. New regulations coming down the pipe will likely mean the end of DFI two-strokes too.  New four-strokes outperform old two-strokes in every way, including power-to-weight. Yamaha introduced a bunch of new four-strokes last fall, and the majority of them are lighter in weight than an equivalent two-stroke. Oh yeah - they also use way less gas, you don't have to buy oil every time you fuel up, they don't smoke/stink, and they don't leave oil slicks in the water.  If ""new"" two-strokes are the future, why has Evinrude lost so much market share in the last 10 years? They've gone from number two in the market to somewhere behind Honda and Suzuki ..... competing with Tohatsu for last place in outboard sales. Why? Oh ... they don't even make a four-stroke.  Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but guys who say they still prefer two-strokes really do need to get out there and actually drive the newer four-stroke outboards. There's just no reason to use a dinosaur, and put up with the extra operating cost and pollution any more."

456338,bigfish1965,2010-04-15 15:07:00,3382,I like the 2 strokes for 25 HP and less. A motor that fires each time the piston reaches the top will always have better low end torque than one that fires every other time. Less moving parts= less to go wrong.
456343,Handlebarz,2010-04-15 15:23:00,3790,My next motor will be a 4 stroke for these couple reasons 1 no smoke from it this is for my family as they seem to get sick from the two stroke at times.  2 no extra oil to make sure is topped up and with the Mariner I have now it leaks oil out the top if its to full as the cap they have for this year sucks it is a flat seal style and does not seal and was only made for a couple years.  3 it seems that I will save a lot of $$$ with the 4 stroke I was fishing with a friend a few years back we went 8-9 hours day 1 4 hours day 2 and he went 4 hours later that day and did not burn much at all compaired to what i would have used.

456379,Another Canadian,2010-04-15 16:36:00,41,"IMO, When you are comparing a 4 stroke motor to the new 2 stroke DFI (Etec / Optimax) there is some benefits to each, but both are good choices in today's world.  You have determine what is personally best and most important to you.  For me it is reliability, and the Honda I run has never let me down (yet).  In the size of motor you are looking at (9.9), there is no 2stroke DFI choice as of now.  The smallest Optimax from Mercury is a 75 and Evinrude has just released a 15 HO.  The 15 HO is actually a detuned 25 as it has the same physical size as the 25.  At 177 lbs, I would not want to try and move it around very much compared to the 15 4 strokes weighing in around 130 lbs.  You can see a comparison on Evinrudes own website.  http://www.evinrude.com/en-CA/Engines/ETEC_HO/ETEC_15_HO  Of course a traditional 2 stroke carburated model weighs less and costs less, but they will be harder to find new as there is less demand for them.  There are still some used ones out there as people trade them in on new 4 strokes.  AC"

(see http://marine.suzuki.ca/Product%20Lines/Outboard%20Motors/Products/DF40/2010/DF40.aspx)  Or if you're really concerned with weight, try this:  Yamaha F40 Four-stroke  ... 205 pounds (see http://www.yamaha-motor.ca/products/products.php?section=td&model=3498#contentTop)  You guys who think four-strokes are automatically heavier than two-strokes are living in the past. In the case of these 40s, the four-stroke is lighter, and by 30 to 45 pounds!  You're right Sinker, finding a new 40hp two-stroke will be almost impossible. The choice is Evinrude - period. Every other manufacturer has gone to four-strokes, and with good reason."
