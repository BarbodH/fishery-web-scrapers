457111,Fisherpete,2010-04-17 17:02:00,1814,"I was thinking about trying at the end of the Rouge where it empties into Lake O... fished there before years ago and caught a carp and some bullheads. Anyone have other suggestions where I can catch suckers in Scarborough?  And YES, I am addicted to catching catfish right now! At least I am not in denial!!!"
457132,John Bacon,2010-04-17 17:53:00,3277,I think further upstream or in Highland Creek would be better suckers than the mouth of the Rouge.  Have you considered M.C. Rockets as a substitute for cut baits.  I know some of the charter boats are going this route.
457136,bigugli,2010-04-17 18:07:00,6138,There is Massey creek running through the property at Pine Hills Cemetary
457254,GBW,2010-04-18 00:33:00,8460,"Come out East a bit, Oshawa creek is FULL of them."
457259,mikeh,2010-04-18 00:52:00,824,Duffins in pickering should have some in there also.
457261,Fisherpete,2010-04-18 01:10:00,1814,"Thanks guys, I'm going to try one of those locations tomorrow. As the saying goes... ""Gonna getcha, suckahhhh!"""
457508,Afraz,2010-04-18 18:19:00,250,"You and me both brotha, i have been stockpiling sucker from the rouge for a while now. So i can get into massive channel cats in dunnville ha ha. Other guys on teh forum have been wondering why are you keeping your suckers. Wait till teh wind dies down then they'll know why.  The run of suckers in the rouge has died down, they are probably up by Glen and Rouge. I was at port hope last week, and the suckers were biting hard.  I guess using mackrel or whole sardines for cat bait would be good too since they are oily fish.  Afraz"
457512,skeeter,2010-04-18 18:26:00,1907,"what do they bite on cause they dont like worms,in oshawa?"
457514,Afraz,2010-04-18 18:31:00,250,"No idea about Oshawa, but P-H they were going insane on worms on a pickrel rig. I think teh trick is to get there late i always fished for suckers during the night. Anywhere from 8 pm - 11 pm."
457598,bonefish,2010-04-18 23:04:00,4,Mouth of any creek.
457610,young_one,2010-04-18 23:45:00,620,"Try 3"" pink worm with long leads! At peak hours, you will actually prefer barbless hook for quick release."
457637,Fisherpete,2010-04-19 00:45:00,1814,"Went 0/3 on sucker locations today... the Rouge at Port Union, the mouth of the Rouge at end of Lawrence and finally the creek running thru Pine Hills cemetary. Didn't even see a fish of ANY species today, except for a dead trout (looked like a rainbow) floating down the Rouge. I am guessing that the low water levels played a role in the lack of fishies. I rarely fish rivers, but would guess that the water levels must have been at least down 18 inches or so. One guy I met on the Rouge told me to keep going up the river for quite a while and the suckers are there - so we walked until we came to an area at the top of a hill in people's backyards - way, way up from the river... and that was enough of that. Oh well, it was a great day to be outside, my son caught his first garter snake, and wifey really enjoyed the scenery and fresh air. All that walking was good for my pooch too(he is a fatty!).  Might try Duffin's tomorrow, or Oshawa creek if that fails. Who's the sucker now... lol!"
457638,Afraz,2010-04-19 00:47:00,250, Umm he wants it for cutbait and not release lol
457641,Steve Piggott,2010-04-19 00:51:00,196,I hope you are using a dip net best way to get them. I just ware my wader and walk trough the holes and scare those suckers into the net.A 6x6 smelt net works great also.
457646,Fisherpete,2010-04-19 00:57:00,1814,"Nope, just fished for them using small hooks with worms. I don't have waders or any type of river fishing gear..."
