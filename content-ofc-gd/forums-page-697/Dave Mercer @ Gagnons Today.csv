Dave starting apologizing to the little guy and the little guy gives Dave an upper cut. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Dave being the guy he is, takes the little guy into the store and then walks out with a bag full of goodies. the little guy was happy now..lol  next time Dave does a show i will make sure im in the line of fire and i dont care if its a tee shirt that hits me, im going down for the count.  keep up the good work dave.  dann"
