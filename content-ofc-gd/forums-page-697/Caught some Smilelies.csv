This would be his second fishing trip...and now that he has his ""own rod"" he is quite the little man! Since I think the river is a little dangerous for a 16 month old we opted to hit up the local conservation area!  We didn't catch any fish but I caught a HUGE smile    He did not want to let me show him how to fish.... he already knows it all!!!"
456706,Roy,2010-04-16 14:43:00,13728,Good stuff! Next he'll be showing you the correct side of a reel you should put the handle on.
456709,TC1OZ,2010-04-16 14:45:00,987, I cast with the rod in my right hand... and I reel in with my right hand... I set the hook with my left...  Am I broken? lol
456712,GBW,2010-04-16 14:51:00,8460,"Good on ya!  PS, yes you are broken..."
456713,TC1OZ,2010-04-16 14:59:00,987,It just feels right? And no ones said anything when they are fishing with me....
456714,GBW,2010-04-16 15:04:00,8460,"not to worry, your son will help you fix it...  just messing with ya..."

456721,TC1OZ,2010-04-16 15:23:00,987,"  haha ya, he was a big boy to start, 10 Lbs 12 Ozs  22 Inches long!  We have another in the oven so I'm hoping its another big boy  And yes... hes way too smart for his age... Terrible 2's started before he was 1 lol."
