456010,TC1OZ,2010-04-14 20:48:00,987,"I'm going to say 100% they knew you or know someone who knows you... Random steal and not worth the charge for what they took... I mean if they stole your jewelry and flat screen TV it could be anyone... But an RC car, welder, and some boat seats?  Sorry about your luck.. I guess its not worth the insurance deductible?"
456031,Ziki,2010-04-14 21:34:00,128,"  Sounds more like stuff one might keep in their Garage, which is easier to access than say a house where one would keep jewelry and a flat screen. So it still sounds like a random garage hopping job, check kjiji and craigslist next few weeks for the RC car is about your best bet..."
