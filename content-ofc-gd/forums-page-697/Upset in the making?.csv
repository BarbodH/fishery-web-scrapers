456786,anders,2010-04-16 18:08:00,1168,"True that...next to the Bruins....i would like to see the hawks...as long as Detroit, Pitts arent there...me happy!"
456790,Roy,2010-04-16 18:29:00,13728,I'm just glad the Habs picked up a win in Washington. They shouldn't have even been in there. The rest is gravy.
456837,Billy Bob,2010-04-16 21:04:00,5865,"One of my favorite comments from the Boston Globe recap:  ""Rask has to pick up his game or the Bruins have no chance of winning this series. He has to see every shot and be at least as good as Miller.""  Ya, right....then there was a miracle...."
456857,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-16 21:26:00,0,how great would it be if BOTH the nhl's golden boys went out in the first round? ovie and cindy can renew their rivalry on the golf course!  GO SENS GO!
456888,JohnF,2010-04-16 22:24:00,3494, The way the games have gone so far you just might be right. Mebbe it is their turn again.  JF
456895,MCTFisher9120,2010-04-16 22:52:00,3761,Pens win the cup.
456904,Stoty,2010-04-16 23:13:00,2910,"The only reason Detroit doesn't look like the same team as last year, is because they never played with a full roster. Someone was always hurt, until a month left. See how they did in the last month?! Now that they are all healthy, look out!!"
457030,Tinman,2010-04-17 11:53:00,376,   GO SENS!!!
457087,Billy Bob,2010-04-17 15:02:00,5865,Strap on your feed bag and buckle your seat belt..in less then two hours with MILLER in goal the Buffalo Sabres are going to turn the Boston Bruins into Panda Bears...  :clapping:
457166,misfish,2010-04-17 19:59:00,29133,See ya in Beantown Billy.
457179,anders,2010-04-17 20:51:00,1168,that was a great game if you were a Bruins fan....hope Vanek returns...next year!!!  Go BRUINS!!
457187,Billy Bob,2010-04-17 21:07:00,5865,Vanek was a GREAT loss....hope he can recover and Buffalo needs to sharpen it's Sabres..
457188,Stoty,2010-04-17 21:09:00,2910,"Now its even... No Savard, no Vanek.  Let the best team win!"
457202,anders,2010-04-17 22:04:00,1168,thats not even close
457205,Northhunter,2010-04-17 22:13:00,214,"Wow. You guys put too much faith in standings.  Habs had a winning record against the caps this year but now they were lucky to get a win?? As good as Ovechkin is, he's never been a habs killer.  Game starts in an hour. They can still sweep"
457236,misfish,2010-04-17 23:27:00,29133, DEEP BREATHS JOE.
456021,misfish,2010-04-14 21:22:00,29133,"Well Im going out on a limb here,but I think the Pens are going down. Ott wins game 7   Bruins win in 5  Washington win in 5  Jersey win in 6  San win 4 straight  Chi win in 5  LA win in 7  Phinx win in 6   If you think Im way off,thats ok.It,s money on the proline.LOL"
456023,Governator,2010-04-14 21:23:00,879,"You're from Barrie, how about we do OHL predictions instead"
456030,misfish,2010-04-14 21:29:00,29133," No dought, COLTS in 5  Colts vs Kit final.  Park will be the killer in that series."
456032,Governator,2010-04-14 21:34:00,879,Spitfire should prevail from that series pretty easily I think.  It's setup perfectly for a barrie/windsor showdown which is what it should be imo.
456037,misfish,2010-04-14 21:48:00,29133,"  Being a call up, way back when    for the Rangers,I got to stick with them."
456044,Stoty,2010-04-14 22:02:00,2910,WSH in 5 NJ in 5 PIT in 4 BUF in 5  SJ in 4 DET in 5 CHI in 4 VAN in 6
456054,Billy Bob,2010-04-14 22:19:00,5865, That's not a upset prediction as much as WISHFUL THINKING.
456059,walleyejigger,2010-04-14 22:26:00,876,"Washington in 6 (i hope lol) in reality in 5 New Jersey in 6 i have a really good feeling for Brodeur playin for the cup this year, although watchin them is like watching paint dry Boston in 5 Pittsburgh in 7  SJ in 4 Chicago in 4 Vancouver in 7 Detroit in 7   as for the OHL i pick the Wolves...... oh wait a minute...... Colts already KILLED us"
456063,misfish,2010-04-14 22:31:00,29133,Im surprised Stoty gave a game.LOL   We SPANKED the wolves.
456110,misfish,2010-04-15 00:14:00,29133, 
456116,JohnF,2010-04-15 00:29:00,3494, Nah. I think the Pens just had a momentary rush of stupid to the head.  JF
456123,Daplumma,2010-04-15 00:46:00,1961,"Ottowa will win this series.I'm a little nervous about my caps.They have been winning but not dominating since the break.Lots of OT and squeakers.Jose has been solid but the O has been a bit anemic,The big O has not been scoring much at all.If Alex and Alex and Nick get hot its all over for everyone but it seems lately it has been the 2nd and 3rd lines that are scoring. Joe"
456517,Billy Bob,2010-04-15 22:26:00,5865,JUST REMEMBER..................   GO SABRES  !  !  !  We can use all the help we can get tonight.....
456523,misfish,2010-04-15 22:31:00,29133,"  Dont change the subject,,,,,,,,,,    Oh, the Colts took game one, 3-0."
456530,Billy Bob,2010-04-15 22:42:00,5865, BASICALLY you got me wondering....best I can guess is you must be a Leaf fan....if so how does is it look...looking from the outside in....LOL...
456532,misfish,2010-04-15 22:49:00,29133," NA, Bruins fan here."
456540,Billy Bob,2010-04-15 23:03:00,5865, GOOD LUCK TONIGHT....here's hoping MILLER is up to standing on his head today....or better said....THE PUCK STOPS HERE !  !  !
456543,yakpiker,2010-04-15 23:14:00,160,"As many of you Hab-Haters know, I cheer for the Rouge, Blanc et Bleu.  I'll be happy if Montreal wins one game against Washington.  Even Patrick Roy would have a tough time stopping Ovie and friends.  It should be a wide open series which will be entertaining."
456563,Dutchy,2010-04-16 00:27:00,416,"Pittsburgh were awful last night and still nearly tied it up at the end. Can Ottawa really play any better than that. I doubt it, but the Pens can. The pens are not as good as they were last year and I don't think they will win the cup.  Colorado shocked me last night, they were great, as were Phoenix. Detroit look a shadow of the team they were even last year. (And I don't dislike Detroit)"
456678,blaque,2010-04-16 12:44:00,2419,"Not to change the subject (tongue in cheek lol) But Buffalo was amped up for a whole 20 minutes of playoff hockey last night. Miller thankfully was up for 60. I can maybe give buffalo 20 more minutes of ""tighter"" hockey in the third..........but that playoff intensity was nowhere to be found in the second or third. Second period looked like they were at the end of a 5 game west coast road trip.  They snuck a win out of it, but if they arent up for playoff hockey every night, every period......wait till they get to Boston."
456687,Billy Bob,2010-04-16 13:31:00,5865,My prediction....Two wins in Buffalo...one in Boston and back to Buffalo to end the series....
456703,anders,2010-04-16 14:30:00,1168,"thats a good fantasty....however...if Bruins play like they did last night, i dont think it will be the way you see it...Miller is a Great goalie...but he even admitted to being a little tired.  I see boston winning on Saturday...they like afternoons  The refs have to get there head on straight...for both teams..  Was a great game though"
456725,blaque,2010-04-16 15:27:00,2419," I gotta agree with anders........i never have a good feeling with afternoon games. I think they should be banned from hockey lol  If Lindy can have the sabres up like he did in the first, for the entire game......theyll do just fine. It was interesting to watch the adjustments last night. Buffalo had the first period, in my  opinion..........then boston adjusted bigtime in the second, then in the third Buffalo adjusted to Bostons adjustment lol.  As far as the ruff stuff, i think they all said to themselves after the first........""uhhhhh.......we cant do this every period for an entire series..........whatta you say we all settle down a bit"" LOL  Where was Kaleta in the third?  THe media asked Rivet after the game if he'd remembered his last playoff game winner............it was followed by one of the most awkward pauses i think ive ever heard in a player interview LOL"
456766,Hud,2010-04-16 17:25:00,140,I'll probably get blasted for this but who cares.  GO HAWKS!  I've waited my entire life to say that the Hawks are taking it.  ITs time to hoist the cup again in Chicago!
456782,blaque,2010-04-16 17:59:00,2419,"Why would you get blasted lol........Your a Hawks fan, fly that flag high whoever you root for!  Next to the Sabres.........I too would love to see Chicago succeed. Its been a long time coming for your city and i can relate. Having said that you guys did get to enjoy quite a little basketball dynasty there for a while, so i dont feel too bad for you. lol  As long as Detroit isnt there again........Ill be happy. Get new blood and new cities to the finals every year, thats how i like it."
