456940,glen,2010-04-17 01:22:00,2641,Heads up people.  Canadian tire has the abu rod and reel on sale for $29.99. The reel is worth $30 on its own.  The rod is worth $25. Go get them.
457060,Stern Rules,2010-04-17 13:42:00,342,Three day sale only and the Brantford store sold out the first day. It would be nice if they carried enough stock for at least 2 days. Very annoying.
457061,glen,2010-04-17 13:46:00,2641,Did you ask if they had any more in the back?  That's what i had to do.
457063,JohnF,2010-04-17 13:50:00,3494," Believe it or not, there was a time when retailers aimed to have no surplus inventory at season end. But then some enterprising soul decided that he liked the look of all that traffic rushing into the store, albeit to score bargains, so he started overstocking or even bringing in year end inventory just to advertise on sale. One thing that's always been the case though is that they really would rather see full retail sales than discount so don't expect overly large supplies of anything good. If all the store's sales volume is at discounted prices (little to no profit) then it's likely the store won't be open much longer. That's why I try not to begrudge my fave retailers some purchases at retail but look to other stores as a source of bargains only. If it closes I'll find others like 'em.  On the other hand doesn't CTC give rain checks on some sale items?  JF"
457064,bigugli,2010-04-17 13:53:00,6138,"The old days of keeping adequate sale stock are long gone. One day sales are meant to be a carrot on a stick. Dangle it in front of your nose and you follow it but never catch it  If you have a hankering for their one day carrots, you end up at the store 3 days in a row.   Even if you get pissed off by lack of inventory, most will still wind up buying something else"

457103,Stoty,2010-04-17 16:27:00,2910,Great deal....but...they won't have it in stock..
457155,bobowski,2010-04-17 19:28:00,360,Not a bad combo. I scooped one up a fews years back when they has the same sale on.
457158,Stern Rules,2010-04-17 19:37:00,342,Yes I did ask and she said they sold out Friday.
457159,Rizzo,2010-04-17 19:39:00,4754,"none available at the Barrie store on Bayfield. They told me to try Mapleview, I told them I don't think so...not driving through south end Barrie traffic to find they are sold out as well!"
457160,Stern Rules,2010-04-17 19:42:00,342,The flyer says no rainchecks for the 3 day sale items.
457163,Stern Rules,2010-04-17 19:50:00,342,They can check their computer to see what stores have them in stock. The website tells you if a store has them but that depends on if they updated it or not. It said the Brantford store had them but that was last updated on Thursday. Now it says Friday. I was in first thing this morning and all were gone. Oh well.
457170,Stoty,2010-04-17 20:24:00,2910,lol....told ya!  CT is HORRIBLE for this..... its unreal how mickey mouse their stores are run!
457180,Cudz,2010-04-17 20:52:00,2652,They had 3 left in Midland when I went at lunch on the first day of the sale.  I bought one for a friend of mine.  They are a great little rod and reel so no wonder they sold out quickly.
457184,ctdd2006,2010-04-17 21:01:00,531,still some left up here in Elliot Lake.  I can grab some if anyone really wants if you happen to be coming anywhere near...
457186,JEREMY,2010-04-17 21:05:00,300,I bought three of them two are for my buck.The other  one is for is for a back up rod.

457207,pike n' whities,2010-04-17 22:17:00,131,"craaaaap i totally forgot about that deal! would be nice to finally get a new set up. the cork on my 3 year old quantum is pretty well done, lol. im pretty hard on rods. im surprised that one lasted as long as it did. im still fishin with it too. gotta also get some braid for my caster. still havent used that thing."
457573,Whitespinnerbait,2010-04-18 22:08:00,2038,Might pick one of those up just to have as a spare...
457583,[emailÂ protected],2010-04-18 22:32:00,15,"bought 2 of these 3 years ago. Still in working condition. The rods are im8 and extremely durable. I've been fishing lilly pads with this setup and 14 pound fireline , cathing largemouth up to 6 lbs. My local CT shop ran ouT, was planning to buy 2 more for my family."
457607,SBCregal,2010-04-18 23:38:00,688,i saw probably 5-6 people carrying them around the burlington store on saturday when i was there.  i went to the fishing section to see what was so special and got there just as a lady picked up the last one.
457639,Mike Pike,2010-04-19 00:49:00,1332,I never go to Crappy tire for their fishing sales.  They do this all the time.  Never very much stock of a particular sale item.  They wasted enough of my time with this practice and won't suck me in again.
457645,Dutchy,2010-04-19 00:55:00,416,I went to three crappy tire stores and not one of them had any of these rods. What a crock.
