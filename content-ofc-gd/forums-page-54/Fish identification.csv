I can't say exactly where it is as it was several years ago and I didn't drive there but it is somewhere on the southern edge of Algonquin Park near Maynooth. There is a fish in the bottom left-hand corner, possibly two, and I'd like to know what it is, however can't find it in online searches (unless it's just a very distorted catfish). Does anyone have any ideas please? "

1035242,grimsbylander,2018-10-15 12:42:00,3016,"I'm not so sure we're even talking about a fish let alone which species. There are at least 5 other dark wave areas on that picture that are all the same size and running the same direction as this ""fish"". I vote simple wave action."

1035288,singingdog,2018-10-16 11:01:00,1047,Really surprised you couldn't find that in a Google search ?
1036412,icedude,2018-11-13 01:33:00,459,Me as well-sure looks like Lake Okanogan-will we ever know?-jk  Paul

1036863,Fiona,2018-11-22 08:09:00,3,Definitely not the Okanagan. This I know because I've never been there. Definitely a Sunset pic!
