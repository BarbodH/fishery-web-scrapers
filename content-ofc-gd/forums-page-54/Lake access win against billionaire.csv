Supreme Court decision has ruled that the public should be able to access fishing lakes near Merritt, B.C., after years of what has been described as a ""David and Goliath"" legal battle. For years, the Douglas Lake Cattle Company (DLCC), the largest working ranch in Canada, owned by U.S. billionaire Stan Kroenke, and a group of determined anglers have been going head to head. Their dispute centred primarily on access to two fishing lakes and a road."

I don't think I would be keeping any for the table regardless. If they are indeed small lakes that aren't restocked I don't think it would take too long to fish them out. Designating them catch and release only would be prudent in my mind because I know some will keep everything they catch."
