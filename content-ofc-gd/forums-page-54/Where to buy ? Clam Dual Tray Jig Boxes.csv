1036857,Backcast,2018-11-22 00:52:00,12,Thanks Pump Knows for the update  on the Clam box . I was hoping for a Black Friday promotion  at SAIL this weekend. With all signs pointing towards a early start to the ice season and  most  fishing products 20% off looks like the perfect weekend to pick up a new ice shelter and a few other items.
1035765,buick14,2018-10-27 20:48:00,741,"Hey a few years ago I bought these at sail, and I really like them.  The only problem is, I can’t find them locally anymore. Does anybody know of a store near Toronto that has them ? http://stores.clamoutdoors.com/dual-tray-jig-box-medium-large-1638.html thanks!"
1035766,porkpie,2018-10-27 21:06:00,2521,As soon as it gets closer to winter sail will probably have them.  They're excellent hook/terminal tackle boxes as well!
1035767,OhioFisherman,2018-10-27 21:28:00,6623,https://www.basspro.com/shop/en/clam-corp-dual-tray-jig-boxes Maybe BPS?
1035768,buick14,2018-10-27 22:36:00,741,"^ I was at BPS today and was told they likely won’t have them, and the same for Sail Etobicoke yesterday...."
1035769,buick14,2018-10-27 22:36:00,741,Ya I want it for terminal tackle.  I really really like them
1035770,mitch seguin,2018-10-27 22:57:00,98,An alternative? http://www.centerpinangling.com/accessories.html
1035772,buick14,2018-10-27 23:48:00,741,"Definitely is a good alternative.  However, the clam is what I’m hoping to stick to...."
1035773,porkpie,2018-10-28 00:17:00,2521,"They work well and I use the green ones for splitshot in my steelhead bag, but they aren't near as durable as the clam boxes.  Now that you brought this up I'll have to grab a couple spares as they are the best terminal tackle box I've ever used and that means they'll stop making them eventually."
1035777,buick14,2018-10-28 12:02:00,741,"^yup, you said it.  I want them before they are discontinued.  My fear is that is happening slowly it’s being fazed out . they close very tightly and the lids are quality snapping etc"
1035779,Backcast,2018-10-28 12:13:00,12,I  was informed at my local SAIL that they have these boxes on order for all the stores in Ontario and they expect delivery by mid to late November. I was also interested in Clam shelter as well and the sales associate  was able to get me the information I was looking for.
1035780,buick14,2018-10-28 13:32:00,741,"^ that’s good to know.  I was actually told the opposite, so I guess we will just have to wait and see!  I hope they continue to carry it, as it’s a very quality box."
1035785,Sinker,2018-10-28 16:14:00,8692,https://www.flambeauoutdoors.com/Fishing/Divider-Systems/Fly-Lockers-and-Boxes/s-cr-blue-ribbon-fly-box-comp-ripple  I have a couple of these that are really nice. Waterproof and very durable.  S.
1035786,Backcast,2018-10-28 16:43:00,12,You always need to take the information you receive from the sales associates in big box stores with a grain of salt. I guess time will tell.

1035967,Backcast,2018-11-02 00:28:00,12,That’s good to know. If the boxes don’t arrive by the time SAIL has its usual  promotion around Black Friday I will keep this option in mind.
1035973,dave524,2018-11-02 09:12:00,4508,"Google  "" weekly twice a day pill organizer "" get them at Dollarama ?"
1035980,PUMP KNOWS,2018-11-02 14:17:00,937,How much do the clam boxes retail for?
1036007,Backcast,2018-11-03 00:41:00,12,Not sure. The sales person at SAIL was able to let me know they were on order. I truly did not enquire on the cost. Like I said I will pass by the store around Black Friday to see what is on special.
1036008,OhioFisherman,2018-11-03 01:10:00,6623,Clam Outdoors™ Dual Tray Jig Boxes : Cabela's That might give you a rough idea of the cost?

1036037,buick14,2018-11-04 12:03:00,741,"Ya I think the large box (the one I like) is $24.99 or $29.99 locally but, the goture one I snagged off of Amazon is same quality and build which I am happy about. However price is also very similar..."
1036038,Backcast,2018-11-04 13:02:00,12,Thanks. I will keep that in mind the next time I  drop by a store or see one on-line. I am planning on trying to purchase  most of my ice fishing needs around Black Friday. Last year all fishing equipment was 20% off except for electronics that was at 15% off during   The SAIL Black Friday event . Not that 20% off a clam box is material however I am also in the market for a  Ice Shelter so now I am waiting for some  possible  pre-ice season deals to hopefully materialize.
1036836,PUMP KNOWS,2018-11-21 18:22:00,937,Looks like it's back in stock... https://www.sail.ca/en/ice-armor-dual-tray-jig-box-large-505622 Buy now to get 20% off
