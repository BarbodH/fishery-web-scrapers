1037344,aplumma,2018-12-02 20:48:00,6896,Many of the high end knifes I make are finished using a glass plate and wet sandpaper working up to 3000 grit. The finished edge when sharpened using the ultra fine grits do not create a burr so the edge is super sharp. I have since switched to using diamond honing paste and balsa wood which it actually not only leaves a burr free edge but it micro polishes it to a laser type shine when you rotate it in the light. Take your time and be precise is the way to get a wicked sharp edge. Art
