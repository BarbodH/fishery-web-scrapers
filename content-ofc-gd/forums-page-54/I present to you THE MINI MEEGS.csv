He hand pours all the baits himself,paints himself and packages his own baits.The detail and hand paint is next to none. Not only does he make the Meegs baits, but is doing spoons,J plugs and jerk baits and top water baits . The man has some serious tackle talent. Stopped in this morning for a coffee and chat, and picked up my supply. These are going to be great for pan fish and those small whities I like. These are 1/4 oz jigs. Made in Barrie Ont CANADA.     Yer da man James. Keep up the great work"
1037329,Acountdeleted,2018-12-02 16:28:00,2562,Holy cow! That’s what i’m Talking about. I love the Meegz in goby print but I find they are a little heavy for me to work properly. Where can I get some of these? 
1037330,SirCranksalot,2018-12-02 16:37:00,3291,Some serious talent!!

1037345,BillM,2018-12-02 21:04:00,17367,"Awesome stuff, definitely need to pick up some of those before the ice hits this winter.   Brian, I might need a lesson on fishing them"
1037384,jimmer,2018-12-03 17:22:00,2730,I caught more whitefish on those things last year than I did over the rest of my life.
1037446,AKRISONER,2018-12-04 14:40:00,5558,RIP Kevin
1037448,PUMP KNOWS,2018-12-04 15:08:00,937,I'll be picking up a few when they're in stock at my local tackle shop. Question... How shallow are you guys targeting whitefish?  This new size should be killer for shallow water whities
1037458,jimmer,2018-12-04 17:09:00,2730,We were getting them in 20 - 30 fow.
1037914,David Chong,2018-12-14 03:26:00,836,"Saw them at the show, they look awesome! Should be the downfall of a lot of fish this winter!!"
1037919,misfish,2018-12-14 14:04:00,29133,David You couldn't turn in any direction and not see them being displayed.  Talked to James and his inventory took a big hit.
