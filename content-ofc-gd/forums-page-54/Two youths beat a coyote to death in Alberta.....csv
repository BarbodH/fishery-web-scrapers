1037151,BillM,2018-11-28 20:15:00,17367,"Let's take it this way.  The kids were bored from playing Fortnite and because they've got nothing else to do and because their parents are burnouts and never instilled any sort of morals in their children, they decided to go out for a snowmobile ride.  While they were out there, they came upon this coyote, ran it over with the snow machine because they thought that was cool.   Then decided to beat it to death because that was also cool. Just another assumption from the stands. "
1037154,AKRISONER,2018-11-28 21:16:00,5558,"some of the yokels on here... I let my pet run wild, and then a predator killed it so my solution is to kill everything that threatens my pets  Lets just kill humans, itd be better for our planet."
1037177,Tjames09,2018-11-29 02:45:00,664,"Im not trying to pass guilt here. I think regardless of what took place before what they did was wrong. I can't see any pretext that would justify torturing it.  And to be clear, they didn't just kill it. They chased it down and tortured it and laughed about it. Did you watch the video? "
1037180,irishfield,2018-11-29 05:09:00,26272,"Is it to early for this, or toooo late?   "
1037190,Fisherman,2018-11-29 13:47:00,7201,Mann that guys got a pretty good arm.
1037200,SirCranksalot,2018-11-29 14:47:00,3291,Who is that guy? He should  be reported!!
1037215,grimsbylander,2018-11-29 16:33:00,3016,Or...maybe the horse stepped on his dog or bucked his kid off! Then it deserves anything it gets...apparently. lol
1037217,Terry,2018-11-29 16:50:00,14456,its one thing to beat a dead horse but to stand there and make a gif of it is just wrong
1037218,SirCranksalot,2018-11-29 16:59:00,3291,??
1037293,aplumma,2018-12-01 14:35:00,6896,That IT I cant sit back and watch someone looking like President Lincoln beating a dead horse for 5 minutes any longer. Looks like this thread has run its course and should be put to sleep.  Art
1036855,misfish,2018-11-22 00:40:00,29133,"You know there is going to be some that will want to eat them. Just like the boots in the rivers taken home,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, YUK"
1036859,BootScoot,2018-11-22 01:14:00,5,Agreed they are terribly overpopulated. All coyotes in Ontario ought to be killed as they are not native to Ontario. 
1036860,Moosebunk,2018-11-22 01:39:00,3970,"Uggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!! Reaching a point it's hard to turn on a computer, TV or phone nowadays."
1036861,chris.brock,2018-11-22 02:02:00,4053,"That's the kind of mentality the kids in the video probably learned from their parents. Coyotes aren't an exotic, invasive species. They've expanded their home range because of what humans have done to the landscape. A coyotes main food source is rodents, mice, groundhogs, rabbits etc., not fawns and poodles. You're better off shooting humans if your goal is to return Ontario to it's natural state, before the white man came. "
1036872,SirCranksalot,2018-11-22 15:14:00,3291,"Coyotes were here in Ont before the white man came.  Of course our ancestors killed many of the native species, including humans. In fairly recent years they have spread back to Eastern Canada and the US. Google it!"
1036888,Freshtrax,2018-11-22 18:15:00,2215,They went around as thick as they are now 10-15 years ago near smiths falls.   Inlaws neigbour has lost 2 dogs in as many years. We do keep the pelts to tan allong with deer hides. And they certanly will take a fawn.    
1036890,Sinker,2018-11-22 18:45:00,8692,"Just to be the devils advocate.....maybe this yote killed thier pet? Or their cattle? Livestock? Who knows. Not the way I'd do it, but still.....we don't know the whole story here. S."
1036892,jimmer,2018-11-22 19:10:00,2730,Please don't blame the parents without knowing for sure.  I have seen some pretty messed up kids that were raised in some fine homes. Impulsiveness and making bad decisions are associated with some mental health issues that parents don't have any control over.
1036893,crappieperchhunter,2018-11-22 19:20:00,2582,Agree 100%. 20 years ago I firmly believed that there was no such thing as bad kids...just bad parents... and I had a very heated argument at my sons soccer game once with a fellow parent who was a school principal and said he had seen the best kids come from the worst parents and visa versa. As the years have past I now have seen this for myself and no longer blame all parents for there kids turning out rotten.  No matter the circumstances some people just turn out to be low lives.  And as Jimmer mentioned mental health can play a role as well which no parent can control.
1036895,LostAnotherOne,2018-11-22 19:21:00,956,One possibility is that todays kids are all about putting stuff on the internet and trying to look cool.  If this is true then they really need a hard lesson on what's right and what's wrong.  I couldn't even watch the video cause the story was enough.  What's going to happen now is that the kids will feel remorse and probably cry in front of the authorities and everyone will move on.
1036896,glen,2018-11-22 19:30:00,2641,Is there a longer vid that one was only 17sec long.
1036915,DanD,2018-11-23 12:21:00,2223,Had a different reply; but I don't want this thread to go down the toilet; with a pissing match. Sorry but I stand with my first post. Dan.
1036916,SirCranksalot,2018-11-23 13:49:00,3291,"That's too long, IMO!! "
1036936,grimsbylander,2018-11-24 15:57:00,3016,"It shouldn't by now but it still surprises me how quickly people go all Game of Thrones on topics like this. When in doubt, wipe them out!? I'm with Chris on this one. Coyotes in Ontario, the hunting season or the regulations related to them have ZERO to do with what happened in this video. Hunters and tree huggers alike should be on the same side and defend the animal's right to NOT be abused."
1037039,jimmer,2018-11-26 19:54:00,2730,I will keep it zipped......
1037044,Terry,2018-11-26 20:33:00,14456,That’s was the point I was trying to make that until we here what lead up to the beating. How can one be judge and jury maybe it killed their beloved pup maybe just punks but untill I know the facts I will not come to a conclusion on the killing
1037045,glen,2018-11-26 20:37:00,2641,Anybody got a vid of a coyote killing someone’s dog.
1037120,BillM,2018-11-28 14:42:00,17367,"Like that coyote killed anything but rabbits and grouse, lol."
1037121,Sinker,2018-11-28 14:51:00,8692,"You think it doesnt happen? It does all the time. Cats too. My buddy found his cat in pieces on his front lawn. How do you think his 5 yr old daughter felt when he had to tell her it was eaten by a coyote? I know a few people who have lost dogs too, and one was a king sheppard, so yes, yotes do kill pets and livestock all the time.   The farm my wife works at constantly has yotes circling their two dogs. One is a 90lb lab, the other is a 100lb king sheppard.  He can't let them out at night without bringing a loaded shot gun and a big light. Where I live, there are a lot of them, and they are a nuisance. I'm not saying what these guys did is right, but maybe that yote was a problem.  S."
1037133,Tjames09,2018-11-28 17:43:00,664,"I don't think any pre context changes what they did. I don't see anything justifying chasing a coyote down with a snowmobile and then grabbing it by the hind legs and smashing to off the snowmobile. Not to mention laughing while doing it; the video shows them enjoying it, not mad that it bit them or killed there dog.  Honestly kind of surprised people are okay with this....this video has nothing to do with hunting or coyotes being a nuisance. Lots of things are nuisances you don't torture them."
1037138,Terry,2018-11-28 18:05:00,14456,and i will never convict someone with out knowing all the facts they may be guilty but maybe the thing attacked him and all he had was his boots and the metal on his snowmobile to kill it with i doubt it but i dont know and neither do the rest of you Honestly kind of surprised  people just assume  
1037141,misfish,2018-11-28 18:52:00,29133,"Is that really your fish, or can I assume someone else caught it, and you just happen to be there to pick it up flopping on the ice, and give it to the owner, but stopped for a picture.  Whats the real story behind that pic.? LMAO"
1037143,Terry,2018-11-28 19:00:00,14456,"well, with me you can assume someone else caught it "

1037145,fred_yu_job,2018-11-28 19:04:00,3,"let's take it this way... your lovely 3 years old daughter was just killed by a coyote, and you caught it! what will you do to that coyote? oh! I know you'll be so nice and release it! but sorry, I can't."
1036733,Tjames09,2018-11-20 01:36:00,664,I don’t even know what to say. I can’t believe someone would be able to kill an alive animal like that; by repeatedly beating it to death. I think that lack of remorse or emotion is very concerning; it’s not natural to torture anything. https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/coyote-beating-grande-prairie-rcmp-investigation-1.4911574

1036758,Spiel,2018-11-20 15:32:00,9065,"Terrible. I can not even bring myself to watching the video, the story sickens me enough."
1036762,Terry,2018-11-20 15:51:00,14456,Did they run it down with the skidoo’s did they find it wounded and killed it did it try to attack them and they killed it just wondering what got them to the point where they could be swinging it by the back legs.
1036765,bobowski,2018-11-20 16:21:00,360,This is disgusting
1036767,Old Ironmaker,2018-11-20 16:39:00,8243,"They were bored and that's why they decided to do that. That and evil. Sometimes I think it best I won't be around for another 40 years. And they are stupid, they video taped it! I hope they get them real good but they won't get more than a slap on the wrist. Juevy offenders."
1036768,Cosmos,2018-11-20 16:41:00,588,They are animals. I hope they will get punished badly for this.
1036769,AKRISONER,2018-11-20 16:50:00,5558,"not surprisingly, many serial killers and psychopathic murderers start their career by torturing animals. laughing at an animal that is hurt is some seriously disturbing stuff...especially an animal like a coyote that resembles/is a dog..."
1036773,JoshS,2018-11-20 17:05:00,729,Wow. Seriously messed up. I really hope these guys get what they deserve.
1036774,Terry,2018-11-20 17:06:00,14456,"Is this a fact or are you guessing not that you won’t be around for 40 years, but that they were bored and just decided to abuse the animal"
1036775,Old Ironmaker,2018-11-20 17:10:00,8243,No I'm just going from what I have read when youths often do something terrible like this.
1036778,DanD,2018-11-20 17:23:00,2223,"These two idiots are bad enough; but in my opinion the parent(s) of these two should also be held accountable. It's obvious the kids didn't have any respect for the animal. And in my opinion, respect is something that is taught and their parents have failed dreadfully. Dan."
1036781,Whitespinnerbait,2018-11-20 17:29:00,2038,Lot of hunters out there shoot coyotes just for the sake of killing them don't they ?????????
1036784,DanD,2018-11-20 17:35:00,2223,Maybe that's the mentality these two kids have; coyotes are a useless animal. But again where did they learn this type of thinking? Dan.
1036804,BillM,2018-11-20 23:03:00,17367,"Sure, but shooting a coyote dead and this are completely different things.    These kids have issues."
1036808,David Chong,2018-11-20 23:18:00,836,"There is nothing right about this! Hopefully, they are prosecuted to the full extent of the law!"
1036814,misfish,2018-11-21 01:02:00,29133,"NO Many farmers have hunters come on to their property to, remove/kill them, to protect their live stock."
1036818,Freshtrax,2018-11-21 04:53:00,2215,"We shoot every coyote and wolf we see in the Ottawa valley they are over run with them.  They snatch pets, livestock and fawns. the last 10 years they have exploded.  I shot a deer last week and had a pack circle me within 15 min of me shooting the deer they are brazen. May sound weird to some even though i shoot them i couldent bring my self to watch the video.   I hope they get the  book thrown at them no animal deserves to suffer like that."

I shot a few coyotes for fur back in the late 70's early 80's, but a 75 gr Hornady hollow point  at 3400 fps out of a 6MM Remington they didn't suffer ? "
1036842,BillM,2018-11-21 22:23:00,17367,Pretty sure from what I've read you need to recover and dispose of them.   So basically bring them in and toss them in the trash?
