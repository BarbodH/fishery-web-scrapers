1037844,Acountdeleted,2018-12-12 19:13:00,2562, I loved reading this. Good on the guy for putting it back. Not all super heroes wear capes.

1037882,OhioFisherman,2018-12-13 15:50:00,6623,That is a long Walleye!
1037885,Jds63,2018-12-13 16:37:00,1365,"36"" Wow that's a beauty , nice that he got his pictures and put it back ...."
1037900,Old Ironmaker,2018-12-13 22:28:00,8243,I've seen some big Eyes but nothing that long. I wonder what it would weight. You comp gurus here can probably do some forensic photography and guestimate it's weight.
1037905,OhioFisherman,2018-12-14 00:49:00,6623," John, those are the weights and lengths from the top fish in that fall brawl thing on Lake Erie, there is quite a bit of variation? the longest fish wasn't even in the top five? #5 was 2 1/2 inches shorter than # 6 but weighed more? The one in the story looks like a nice healthy fish, but not particularly fat? and it doesn't give a girth? A fish to be happy with though no matter what the weight? and a nice release? 15lbs +? hard to tell?"
1037907,Joeytier,2018-12-14 01:18:00,3990,"Wow...36"" is wild!"
1037912,David Chong,2018-12-14 03:19:00,836,"36"" is a huge length for a walleye! Beautiful fish!"
