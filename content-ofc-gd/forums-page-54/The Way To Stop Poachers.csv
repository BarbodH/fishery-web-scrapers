They don't mess around in Alaska. https://www.ktuu.com/content/news/Alaska-man-sentenced-to-fine-jail-time-for-poaching-wasting-three-bull-moose-502204901.html?fbclid=IwAR3_tMG0qVR_Y6dul374VIEfE6UJkPTbc2LGFNd7qRyWbvbf7sVzwyNSqmE

He should never be allowed to hunt again, or own any firearm since taking away his licence probably won’t stop him anyway. I just can’t comprehend the level of stupidity and complete lack of ethics of some people."
1037715,woodenboater,2018-12-09 20:56:00,2277,"sounds like the guy just wanted to kill something, since he chose to leave the moose behind to waste. but yeah, shld lose his license forever, then if he's caught poaching again, he shld have the book thrown at him."
1037733,Acountdeleted,2018-12-10 12:20:00,2562,Agreed with the other posters. I would give this fine for shooting 1 moose out of season and wasting the meat. But 3?!?!? Jesus.
