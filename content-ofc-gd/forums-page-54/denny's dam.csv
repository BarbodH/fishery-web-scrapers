1036698,muskybw,2018-11-19 14:31:00,116,"i heard they are catching lots of bows right now, anyone up there, show us some chrome pics ? thanks."

1036838,PUMP KNOWS,2018-11-21 18:29:00,937,I wish I was up there
1036841,misfish,2018-11-21 21:32:00,29133,"I wish it was not a 6 hour round trip drive. But then again, I got lots of waters to fish an hour away."
1036847,SirCranksalot,2018-11-21 22:41:00,3291,Must have been 'nice' up there today with the blowing snow and the wind off the lake!!?
1036848,BillM,2018-11-21 23:18:00,17367,"I'm usually there in less then 2.   Although I speed quite a bit and take the back way, lol."
1036852,misfish,2018-11-21 23:57:00,29133,"I like the tour route.LOL  Ok,lets go,yer driving. LOL  Edit to add  Theres a back way ?"
1037118,DJGeneral,2018-11-28 14:16:00,163,Well since no one wants to post up chromers here are  a few from separate outings Not Dennys Dam but it close by i think i did well this season not only learning more about float fishing but incorporating beads when things slow down i think its time i get a centerpin any suggestions? I'm done for the year bring on the HARD WATER!   
1037174,muskybw,2018-11-29 01:55:00,116,"DJ general --nice fish, i didn't look like you had a lot of water where you were ? i tried the centre pins on a 13 ft. pole, i don't know ? i have 3 daiwa tournament ss 1300's reels, on 9,10,11 ft - loomis blanks. i use yarn, lots of colors & purple sponge balls, bottom bouncing with a few splits above a 3 ft. floro leader. i fish the maitland & bayfield rivers. -- i'm 67, i can't see well enough to tie a # 2 hook on 2 lb. floro leader ? your much younger and should have no problem tying or casting, i couldn't master that either ? the bayfield river, if the water is low, this yr. -i will use 9 ft, 7 wt. looms fly rod with a cheap browning reel on it, works well together.   DJ  - if you got all those nice fish on a centre pin, that's your story, stick to it ."
1037178,BillM,2018-11-29 03:57:00,17367,"Love the Bayfield, too bad it's quite the haul from Barrie.   Fun river to fish."
1037187,DJGeneral,2018-11-29 13:13:00,163,"That first fish i had to walk downstream so i could land it as i didn't have my waders wasn't a planned trip to the river we just stopped in after night crappie fishing good thing i had my vibrax and my panther martins with me that day, i haven't upgraded to a center pin as of yet thinking about doing it this spring since i did so well on a spinning reel set up"
1037195,muskybw,2018-11-29 14:32:00,116,"hi there Bill M-- i'm glad to hear somebody loved fishing the bayfield river. i use to go every spring, opening day, stay 10 days in rainbow valley campground, $ 6 bucks a day ! old joe brandon, that owned the hardware store in town, owned the campground. no hydro, no sewers. 3 outhouses, 2 wells with continuous running water & a dump station ! i called it hobo heaven ? but the fishing, if the water was high enough, was amazing ! i did for a dozen yrs. i knew every hole in the river, right to the highway bridge in the town of VARNA , 7 miles upstream. i caught over those yrs., maybe a dozen yrs., a couple of hundred bows, not a lie. i loved it in hobo heaven, but i really loved the beautiful river & town of bayfield ! i then moved farther north to goderich, bought a 2 bedroom trailer, right on the maitland river, GOD'S COUNTRY, 20 yrs. of nothing but great scenery & fishing !  WOW, THOSE WERE THE DAYS !!!"
1037225,craigdritchie,2018-11-29 19:05:00,1586, That is one sweet looking coho. Nice fish man.
1037227,BillM,2018-11-29 19:13:00,17367,"I usually fish from Varna down    I'm sure the Saugeen is loaded with fish, just gotta keep an eye on the water levels.  Funny thing about that river I've found is that even if it's high and off colour they like the smaller stuff.  I never do well there running big bombers.  Usually just chartreuse or pink, 3-4 chinook eggs is all it takes and long leads."
1037230,DJGeneral,2018-11-29 19:44:00,163,Thanks Craig! didnt know what it is tbh i thought it was an atlantic or a bow either she lived to see another day! I remember last year around this time we were chucking spoons at the dam and we were hitting them pink and chrome work the best
1037234,BillM,2018-11-29 21:21:00,17367,Sometimes I don't even bother bringing my float gear.  Great hardware river.
1037236,misfish,2018-11-29 21:31:00,29133,"2 hours and 44 min. That means if your driving Bill,thats 1 hour 45 min."
1037237,BillM,2018-11-29 21:47:00,17367,I like the way you think Brian
1037242,muskybw,2018-11-30 01:34:00,116,"BillM--the last time you were at denny's dam, did you camp on the flats, or just a day trip ? i just wondered if the HAMILTON STEELHEADERS, were still running the show on the flats, camping permits & putting fish over the damn, fish ladder ?"
1037250,BillM,2018-11-30 04:52:00,17367,I just make a day trip out of it.   If the Geen isn't fishing there are a few other options close by to try and salvage the day.
