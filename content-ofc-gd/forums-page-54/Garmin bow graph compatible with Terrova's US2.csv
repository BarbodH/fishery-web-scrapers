1036986,tizfun,2018-11-25 23:56:00,292,I just purchased my 1st Garmin. It's the EchoMap 95sv plus which will go on my console I'm looking for a simple Garmin graph to pair up with my Terrrova US2 transducer. I really only need 2d sonar for now.. I'm just not sure which will be compatible and which cord I'll need to pair it up... Any help will be much appreciated..  Thanks
