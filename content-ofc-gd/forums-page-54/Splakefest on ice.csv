1037955,Old Ironmaker,2018-12-15 04:37:00,8243,"8 minutes, perfect. Didn't look too cold that day. I'm freezing and it's plus 7C here today. That self hook set rig looks like it works great. Nothing worse than deep hooking a fish you don't want to kill. Those little buggers sure are spunky pretty too Joeytier. Good going."
