1036782,DanD,2018-11-20 17:30:00,2223,I think it looks like a great idea? Dan.
1036789,AKRISONER,2018-11-20 20:05:00,5558,im gonna make some of these to work in conjunction with my plano box i will let you guys know how it goes. the plano box has sucked so far but if these bands keep the line spooled better it might be a winner.
1036837,PUMP KNOWS,2018-11-21 18:28:00,937,I use it for steelheading when I'm usually pulling out line often during an outing.  I've always gone with the rubber bands but they don't always hold the line in place.

1036845,SirCranksalot,2018-11-21 22:32:00,3291,I use 2 elastic bands knotted together to form a figure 8. The one that goes around the spool is usually those that come off broccoli (quite wide).The other one is for pulling on.
