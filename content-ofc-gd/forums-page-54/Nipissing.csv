1036662,wvmedic,2018-11-17 21:20:00,144,"@Joetier, spelling corrected. Nipissing is my absolute favourite place in the world. Been going to Nipissing since the early 70's as a kid when Wally and Hazel was running Lakair. Want to bring my Son and Grandson's up to fish for Walleye and Pike. I've been fishing in Quebec since my Wife died, we spent our 34th Anniversary there in 2015, she died December 2016. So, I want to show the Kids where the Wife and I enjoyed spending time. Want to get on some nice fishing as well.  Thanks, Jeff"
1036680,porkpie,2018-11-18 18:51:00,2521,The fishery is fantastic.  It's harder to get keepers over 18.1 but even that has improved.  I fish it a few times every summer and numbers are gery good.  Perch fishing is pretty darn good too and even though we don't specifically target them we always turn up a few nice pike each trip.  If your looking for a decent cottage with reasonable rates and exceptional grounds PM me and I'll give you the contact info.

1036682,TJQ,2018-11-18 19:17:00,7806,"Yup, i dont get out there much, but ive heard that the numbers are fantastic!"
1036690,Rod Caster,2018-11-19 13:22:00,5784,"Nip just keeps producing. I expect a really good year this winter. I also expect the regs to change soon. Get ready to keep smaller ones, me thinks."

1036707,David Chong,2018-11-19 20:21:00,836,"Always enjoy trips to Nipissing both summer & winter! Haven't been lately but friends who have been, tell me that the fishing is still great!"
1036907,wvmedic,2018-11-23 00:15:00,144,"I should have stated in my question, I'm referring to the West Arm. I've never been in the main lake.  Thank you, Jeff"
