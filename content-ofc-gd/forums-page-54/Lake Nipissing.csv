1037377,bobowski,2018-12-03 12:25:00,360,Not any good ice yet. Walleye doesn't open until Jan 1st.
1037378,porkpie,2018-12-03 12:47:00,2521,"Lake Nipissing is closed to all species from Decenber 1 to Jan 1.  You could look into panfish or trout in zone 11 on another waterbody, but Nipissing is off limits for now."
