The problem is one weather site says big south winds in the morning switching to north in afternoon, the other site shows big north winds all day. Big south winds is doable...big north winds is death. Since we are content to fish from 8-2 we would be willing to make the long trek if we actually knew with some reliability what the winds would be. How can one site have the exact opposite of the other (north vs south??). This much I know...odds are if we make the long drive it'll be a north wind, if we cancel, oh it'll be out of the south alright!"

1036971,smitty55,2018-11-25 18:06:00,928,Have you tried Windfinder? I find it to be fairly accurate. Cheers
1036972,Fisherman,2018-11-25 18:35:00,7201,"Check both of these, they are pretty accurate:https://www.windyty.com/?gust,43.086,-79.419,9  and https://www.windfinder.com/ Kinda funny that they're not the same today, EC canada says from the north too."
1036973,LostAnotherOne,2018-11-25 19:42:00,956,Hope it works out for you.  Two weekends ago on my way to Sturgeon Lake I had to turn around cause there’s was a crap load of snow on the ground.  Didn’t call for any snow too.  Waste of 5 hours of driving.  This time of year is so sketchy.
1036980,OhioFisherman,2018-11-25 23:15:00,6623,A day of change here tomorrow sw winds to 27 mph and turning to n nw with gusts to 45 mph. https://fox8.com/2018/11/25/millions-under-blizzard-warning-as-winter-storm-impacts-holiday-travel/
