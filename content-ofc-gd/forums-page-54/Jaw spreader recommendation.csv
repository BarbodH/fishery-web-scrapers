1036987,LostAnotherOne,2018-11-25 23:57:00,956,Basically looking for something that can do the least amount of damage and can handle anything from a 30 inch pike to a 50 inch musky.  Thanks
1036993,Rattletrap2,2018-11-26 00:36:00,1652,The Cuda one looks pretty decent. I got one for my Daughter last year. She is the one that fishes for toothy critters in our family!
1036999,_al87_outdoors,2018-11-26 01:46:00,22,They work great can confirm 
1037027,BillM,2018-11-26 17:20:00,17367,Jaw spreaders are great as long as you've got the release tools to make use of them.  The 8in Kobalt bolt cutters from Lowes are a less expensive versions of the Knipex and work great.    If you're chasing ski's I'd suggest a pair.
1037031,LostAnotherOne,2018-11-26 18:01:00,956,"Thanks guys.  Gonna pic up one of those Cuda jaw spreaders and a pair of 8 inch bolt cutters just in case.  They may be at the bottom of my tackle box for the next 40 years and never used, but I would honestly feel pretty crappy if i lost a fish cause i didnt have them on board.  Thanks"
1037034,_al87_outdoors,2018-11-26 18:24:00,22,"Agree, cutting hooks for the safe release of a fish is often necessary but well worth it for the chance to handle such amazing fish. I second the opinion on the cutters they don’t have to be fancy just sharp and do the job quick ..."
1037089,BillM,2018-11-27 17:36:00,17367,"Yup, don't go ripping out deep hooks.  Hooks are cheap.   Just cut them.   Or if you really wanna drive guys crazy, go barbless"
1037111,Raf,2018-11-28 00:35:00,3495,In my experience spreaders are useless on big fish - just cut the hooks.  They work fine on hammerhandles.
1037137,lew,2018-11-28 17:56:00,12766,"Hey Brian, I bet you were a proud Dad the day your daughter landed this beaut !! Outstanding fish there Girl !!!!"
1037142,_al87_outdoors,2018-11-28 18:58:00,22,"Hey Lew, I  try to make him proud every day fishing or not...but I know he’s smiling when I’m catching fish . He taught me well... now and then I like to show him what i’ve learned along the way... and enjoy chasing the tug with him on his new boat ? "
1037146,lew,2018-11-28 19:21:00,12766,"It would appear you learned quite a bit along the way LOL I've known your Dad a long time, he's a great guy."
1037188,David Chong,2018-11-29 13:22:00,836,All the Cuda gear looks like pretty good quality! I have some some scissors from them and they work great! Gonna pick up their Jaw Spreaders for pike this spring!
1037199,AKRISONER,2018-11-29 14:46:00,5558,"dont under estimate when you will need a good set of spreaders, a lindy glove and some bolt cutters.  My second ski absolutely inhaled a twin 10 and fisherpete had to perform a miraculous surgery of reaching deep into a muskys throat to cut a barb, and then revive the fish, cut another hook, revive, finally pulling out the remaining bits stuck in its throat. The along with final revival took 45 minutes, in which the fish then recovered and took off strong. Absolutely no doubt without the proper tools that was a dead 46 inch fish. I never wear a ""glove"" to handle fish, but if handling the fish involves lipping a big pike or musky in order to save its life, or shoving your hands way into its mouth..trust me the teeth are sharp, and the infection that comes along with it is nasty as well lol ask me how i know."
1037295,mike rousseau,2018-12-01 15:03:00,4661,Baker makes a heavey wire spreader... that’s what I use and like it  most spreaders are not strong enough to open a mouth of a large fish  Use the spreader to gain access to the hooks for cutting or removal if you have clearance not to damage gills  Another trick... if your fish are inhaling the bait all the time... use bigger baits  musky were swallowing reg size bulldogs on me so now I only throw mags or pounders and haven’t hade deep hooking issues
1037297,Moosebunk,2018-12-01 15:23:00,3970,"Can't remember ever using spreaders on skis at all. For pike, I keep a pair of cheap 6"" bakers. If one won't open the mouth enough, two at once usually does."
1037298,_al87_outdoors,2018-12-01 15:23:00,22,Your advice is excellent. I think my favourite part is when you said that you can only use bigger baits because your fish are so eager... real problem to have in the musky world? I can happily say Never caused any harm to a musky!!
1037300,lew,2018-12-01 15:31:00,12766,"Spreaders aren't always necessary, but if your not using them pay attention to where your hand goes LOL "
1037304,_al87_outdoors,2018-12-01 16:57:00,22,I have some similar pictures I’m always happier for it to be me shedding blood then the fish.
1037352,Rattletrap2,2018-12-03 00:31:00,1652,Thanks for the kind words Lew! Amanda does make me proud! I'm not sure I like the idea of her getting out fishing more days per year than me.....but I'm working on rectifying that situation! lol
