Also got to use a feature that I don't often on my Navionics app on my iPhone to check on the Tides, pretty cool!  "
1037192,grimsbylander,2018-11-29 14:23:00,3016,Nice going David. Looks like the weather is going to improve for you.
1037197,AKRISONER,2018-11-29 14:43:00,5558,8 degrees? those florida folks must think you are crazy fishing in that kind of cold lol ocean fishing is just a different beast all together. Id like to try surf fishing some time. I have a bunch of buddies that do it in Brisbane Australia.
