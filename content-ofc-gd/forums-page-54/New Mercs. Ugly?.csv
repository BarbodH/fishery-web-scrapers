1036342,captpierre,2018-11-11 13:20:00,2521,Is it just me or do others think the new Mercs are ugly?  
1036344,Old Ironmaker,2018-11-11 14:23:00,8243,"I actually like them. Even the Evinrude's when they started this trend. If I could afford a new power plant I wish Merc would offer something other than black. Maybe they do now. Like Henry Ford once said ""You can get any color you want as long as it's black."
1036346,OhioFisherman,2018-11-11 14:47:00,6623,I'll bet the price is uglier?
1036350,Fisherman,2018-11-11 16:10:00,7201,"It's aerodynamic, makes it go faster back to the shop for repairs.  It's like everything else, they have to have a change and make it look fashionable."
1036351,Mister G,2018-11-11 16:47:00,1429,Merc has produce WHITE Mercs for a long time........seen mostly in the Marine World (ocean vessels).
1036354,Rattletrap2,2018-11-11 16:57:00,1652,They do look a lot like an Evinrude now! Not necessarily a good thing to look like them in my opinion. Black is beautiful! I hope they never change!
1036366,Rizzo,2018-11-11 22:16:00,4754,I personally don't care what my anchor looks like
1036710,Lape0019,2018-11-19 20:50:00,647,"I am not a huge fan of them. But... I have a G2 and when they first came out I thought they were ugly also. Give me a year and I will probably think this thing looks great.  I will say though from a functionality/aerodynamic view, it should cut down on wind resistance."
1036713,David Chong,2018-11-19 21:08:00,836,"Not really a big fan of the look of the new Evinrude G2's, the Merc's are little better looking, but performance is the most important feature! A motor can be as ugly as sin as long as it performs up to the advertising!"
1036730,misfish,2018-11-20 00:48:00,29133,Seen one of these this fall on the back of a bass boat. HUGE. Size of a fridge.  
1036791,Lape0019,2018-11-20 20:13:00,647,"Yeah... they definitely aren't small lol. For what it's worth, I have 20 hours on mine and so far, ove it!"
1036795,misfish,2018-11-20 21:18:00,29133,"I thought the stern would be under water  ,but the boat was straight flat. Never did get to see it hole shot.  Huge, but not heavy I guess."
1036797,TJQ,2018-11-20 21:45:00,7806,Geez.. looks like an alien....
1036870,wvmedic,2018-11-22 14:55:00,144,One of the reasons I went with Yamaha.
1036871,David Chong,2018-11-22 15:07:00,836,You won't be sorry! Love my Yamaha!
1036873,wvmedic,2018-11-22 15:14:00,144,"Haven't put mine in the water yet. Still waiting on Alumacraft to finish my boat. Bought a V16 utility, said 8 to 12 weeks to build. This week makes 8 weeks since I ordered it and a shorelander trailer. I hope the new 25hp Yamaha with the troll assist gets me down to a nice trolling speed for Walleye. Might even try for some Lake Trout this coming year."
