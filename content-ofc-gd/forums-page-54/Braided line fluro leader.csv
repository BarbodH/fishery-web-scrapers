1037899,Old Ironmaker,2018-12-13 22:17:00,8243,"The biggest challenge I have tying knots these days are eyesight and loss of hand dexterity.  I can tie a modified Trilene without looking. I don't know what they call it today. The polymer is my go to when tossing hardware for Bass. Modified Trilene is through the eye, 6 or 7 wraps around the main line, back through the loop you made, back through the new loop spit and done. In 40 years of using this knot I can say one has never failed. I call it the Lefko knot because Mr. Lefko showed me how way back when Dino's roamed the Earth. Brian it's not that I don't like long videos it's that my attention span is shorter now as well as getting closer to my best before date."

1037441,Gil Levesque,2018-12-04 12:04:00,103,I use the Alberto knot. Much easier than the fg and very small when finished.
1037443,Acountdeleted,2018-12-04 12:47:00,2562, Thanks. Looks pretty handy. I'll see if they have one at Sail today.  Lots of good advice in this thread. Thanks everyone.
1037463,SirCranksalot,2018-12-04 17:29:00,3291,"Thx, guys. I have no trouble learning new knots. My prob is that I forget them again unless I use them regularly! i.e at my age my forgetting curve is steeper than my learning. I think I'll buy 1 of those gizmos---I can order online and get it delivered to Cabelas Barrie for about $10. "
1037464,bobowski,2018-12-04 17:43:00,360,There are also apps you can download that will show you how to tie all kinds of knots.
1037469,NAW,2018-12-04 19:41:00,4022,X2  I can tie a double uni nearly with me eyes closed and in a fraction of the time.    They really are very easy to tie once you get used to it.
1037471,Acountdeleted,2018-12-04 19:50:00,2562,I bought a pack of these when my uni knots don't work out so well.

1037478,Sinker,2018-12-04 21:35:00,8692,"Me too. The swivel is handy to have on your line as well.  Btw....i never reel the swivel through my rod tip with a fish on. Ever. If im icefishing i use a shorter leader....about the length of my rod, so 28-36"" or so. Thats enough. The swivel will take out the ceramic in the rod tip for sure after a while and you risk the fish taking a run and breaking the leader if the swivel gets caught.  S"
1037481,AKRISONER,2018-12-04 22:11:00,5558,If you are looking for an easy knot to tie? forget every knot in this thread...the lefty kreh knot is by far the easiest line to line knot in existence. for more ideas for simple knots check my thread from back in May

1037863,Canuck,2018-12-13 03:26:00,491,FG knot is pretty simple and you can tie it when its cold easier than a double uni. Great for braid to mono or fluoro leaders.
1037864,krr6581,2018-12-13 03:47:00,5,"I realize that I am coming to the party late on this subject but I have to agree with David Chong on the Alberto knot.  I also use the FG knot and it is dependent on the size guides on my rods. For standard guides I use the Alberto knot, however on my rods with micro guides I find the FG knot goes through the guides better without trying to hang up on them.  As for the video below I don't use the rings they show in the video to help tighten up the knot. The Alberto is really easy to tie and less time consuming than the Uni to Uni. As for length of leader I go with  a 6 foot leader. Since your probably using Ice fishing rods 18 to 24 inches probably is all you need as the amount of light available should keep your braid relatively hard to see by the fish.  "
1037866,Old Ironmaker,2018-12-13 04:52:00,8243,"Not ice fishing but I have lost too many good and expensive hardware trying to tie braid to flouro. I use a micro swivel on all my downrigger rods. Yes damage can happen to the eyes and or line when the swivel is spooled onto the reel. A dab of super glue on the swivel works for me. No broken line so far, around 8 years since I started long lining for Eyes on Erie ( the most boring style of fishing by the way).  I plan on fishing next year and have plenty of time to practice knots this winter."
1037867,Old Ironmaker,2018-12-13 04:58:00,8243,jerpears let us know if you find one of these gizmos at Sail please. Will it work with flouro to braid?
1037869,misfish,2018-12-13 11:28:00,29133,"I know you don't like my long videos,,,, LOL But every laker caught is uni/uni braid  to floro. Ice fishing same thing. River, same thing, unless I am slip floating, down rig same thing."
1037870,Garnet,2018-12-13 11:34:00,2056,All these knots are just a misery. Because you need to practice tying them. Triple surgeon fast easy and it works.
1037878,limeyangler,2018-12-13 15:06:00,5204,"Uni to uni for me in most situations. I used to use the micro swivels, but I like the longer leader and as small as they are, they get ice build up and get stuck in the guides. The micro swivel on the shorter leader would also attract fish past my bait in some situations, especially panfish. I've had crappie more interested in the swivel than the bait, almost thought of freelining a micro swivel....lol. What I did like about the micro swivels was it helped avoid line twist. Nothing worse than trying to present a bait motionless when all the while it is doing the 'helicopter' under your feet. I got round this by using micro snap swivels at the hook end. The FG knot is AMAZING! However, given the size of line I use for ice fishing the FG not is useless as it is only effective using very mismatched line diameters, i.e. thin braid and fat fluorocarbon. I would say go with a long leader( fluorocarbon has very little stretch compared to mono) and uni to uni with or without a micro snap at the hook end. Keep some micro swivels with you and watch your fish finder, if fish are coming up but not biting change things up or take up golf.?"
1037891,Mike Pike,2018-12-13 19:05:00,1332,"Anyone else use an Albright knot in this situation? Although the Albright is a pain to tie( especially winter out in the open when your fingers are cold ), it works really really well."
1037385,Acountdeleted,2018-12-03 17:39:00,2562,"Hey everyone,  I figured before I started fixing up my gear for ice season I would get some advice from everyone. I have always heard for Lakers to use braid and then add a fluro leader (i’ve Heard different lengths) to the end to ensure best hooksets without the fish seeing the line. The problem I have had is that when I add a 18 inch to 2 ft leader 1) I can’t get the snap swivel through the eyelets of the rod to hook the lure on to the eyelets when i’m Done for the day. 2) I can’t get the snap swivel through the eyelets when i’m Reeling up the fish meaning I usually have to either stand up or back away from the hole making landing the fish super hard. Have any of you had this dilemma? What did you do to solve this? Any gear recommended for smaller or narrower snap swivels?  Thanks."
1037387,misfish,2018-12-03 18:02:00,29133,"1- 6ft leader 2- uni to uni  No swivel to worry about. It,s the only way I fish. Hard or soft water. "
1037388,crappieperchhunter,2018-12-03 18:03:00,2582,I have just always used a short enough lead so that I don't have to worry about the swivel going into the eyelets. I really don't think a shorter lead scares the fish especially if your after lakers or anything in deeper water.  Another option I have used is I tape some black electrical tape around the bottom of the butt of the rod. Then when I'm ready to call it a day or I'm moving I hook my lure into the electrical tape which saves your cork or whatever material is on your butt from getting damaged. Taping it to the very bottom also will give in most cases at least another foot longer you can tie your leader.
1037389,Acountdeleted,2018-12-03 18:13:00,2562,B what knot do you use? Will a reef or square not work to hold it? This is a really good idea! Thanks.
1037390,DRIFTER_016,2018-12-03 18:40:00,10439,Yup!!! Even better if you use an FG knot as it's more streamline and doesn't catch on the guides. Especially when using heavier leaders.
1037391,DRIFTER_016,2018-12-03 18:42:00,10439,He is using a double UNI knot. 
1037392,Acountdeleted,2018-12-03 18:45:00,2562,I gotta look these up. They didn't teach either of these in college.  Woof. Just looked these up online. I'm going to be practicing lots after my knee surgery so I don't screw em up. I'd hate to miss a step and lose a good fish because of it.
1037394,bobowski,2018-12-03 19:36:00,360,Do this. Nice long leader. You want your leader line in your spool when the fish gets to the hole.
1037397,msp,2018-12-03 19:57:00,1336,Back to back uni knot is all I use. not just for ice fishing. for all applications
1037401,Sinker,2018-12-03 21:11:00,8692,"Use a smaller swivel. Mine reel right through the guides easy. Micro. I generally tie an improved clinch, to improved clinch knot though.....hasn't failed me yet. Simple and effective.  S."
1037405,Acountdeleted,2018-12-03 21:40:00,2562,"How do you know if the swivel is small enough to fit through the hole? (Thinking I may bring my rod into BP with me) also to the guys saying a 6ft leader, do you find it effects the hooksets with the stretch in the line at all?"
1037406,SirCranksalot,2018-12-03 21:41:00,3291,"I find joining fluoro or even mono to braid a bit tricky. I have used uni x 2 before, but what's FG? "
1037407,Lape0019,2018-12-03 21:49:00,647,"I don't ice fish but also use the Uni to Uni knot to join flouro to braid mainline. It is an easy enough knot to learn. Just make sure you have a lot of lubrication, especially on the flouro side before you cinch it down. I do not see a need for a swivel at all. As for the FG knot SirCranksalot, it is best described as a woven knot kind of like a Chinese finger trap. JP DeRose has a good visio on it up on youtube. I have yet to try and tie it since the uni to uni has served me well but the from what I have seen with friends, the knot sails through guides withought making any racket. it is very streamlined."
1037408,bobowski,2018-12-03 21:49:00,360,No stretch with flouro
1037410,misfish,2018-12-03 22:01:00,29133,"Are you questioning here? Or doughting us ?  LOL  I use the same knot going mono or braid, to floro. Ice rods,float fishing . Like said,Get that line wet when clinching. I like the uni to uni, as I can tie it with my eyes closed. Simple.  No disrespect to my friend here, but you will damage the eye eventually. You will get sharp edges on the eye and you will break your line. This was my findings. Like said, No disrespect."
1037417,huzzsaba,2018-12-03 23:10:00,884,what weight fluoro leader do you use for lakers?

1037419,misfish,2018-12-03 23:32:00,29133,"I use 8-10 lb . I will go 6lb for white fish. My braid is 20-30 lb. This is for my ice rods and open water too. The important thing is drag set. Ice fishing you are using a smaller rod. Your drag is your friend. You might of noticed in my laker vids, how the drag peeled . These are strong fish. I have had big fish come up quick. Once they see the surface, or my ugly mug, they want to streak back down to the bottom. Right drag setting, right line set up, will work."
1037420,misfish,2018-12-03 23:33:00,29133,"Like the old saying, just dew  the dew. .LOL"

1037423,Garnet,2018-12-04 00:08:00,2056,I use steehead swivels Phantom micro. I also wrap the line around the reel stem and back up to a guide. Not usually all the way to tip.
1037424,OhioFisherman,2018-12-04 00:13:00,6623,They show some knots for braid to a leader on this video.
1037425,Fisherman,2018-12-04 00:26:00,7201,That took soooooo long I'm ready for a pizza.   Can't imagine doing that in winter.
1037427,crappieperchhunter,2018-12-04 00:39:00,2582,I agree with this Brian. I ruined a guide this way on my most expensive rod. The worst part was I never found the true problem right away and I repeatedly lost fish and tackle to line breaks until I figured it out. I still use a swivel to help with line twist but I ALWAYS tie my leader short enough so the swivel NEVER enters my guides.
