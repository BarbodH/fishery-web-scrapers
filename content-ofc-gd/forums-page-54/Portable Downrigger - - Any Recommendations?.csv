1037148,T-Bone,2018-11-28 20:00:00,160,"I have a nephew on my list this year that would like a ""portable downrigger"" for Christmas. This would be used primarily for fishing suspended lakers and would likely be attached to a 16-foot Naden camp boat. Any recommendations are appreciated. Thanks."
1037149,BillM,2018-11-28 20:07:00,17367,Scotty 1071 with the portable clamp mount?
1037150,Nemo,2018-11-28 20:08:00,727,Used them for canoe laker fishing in 30-50' of water in Algonquin Park for years.... 
1037156,misfish,2018-11-28 21:34:00,29133,Yup. Mounting one on my toon next year. Small and light. Cant wait to try it. Going to be a blast.
1037157,Tomcat,2018-11-28 22:02:00,395,I was completely satisfied with my Scotty 1050 Depthmaster portable downrigger for years.
1037257,Sinker,2018-11-30 14:54:00,8692,"I have a scotty, and a big john short arm that both work great. I tend to prefer the scotty for ease of deploying the ball, but the big johns are nicer to look at. They both work flawless though.  S."
1037258,Terry,2018-11-30 14:58:00,14456,I have the Scotty with the clamp no counter and 4 or 5 lb max ball 100 ft of cable
1037261,grimsbylander,2018-11-30 15:14:00,3016,I think you can safely get him a Scotty
1037262,T-Bone,2018-11-30 15:20:00,160,"Thanks for the references guys; checked out the Scotty and the only thing I believe may be an issue is that it does NOT have a counter on it. There is another portable called a Cannon that has a built-in counter. I'm not a downrigger/troller, so how important is it to have that counter? Would seem to be pretty important to me...but I'm just guessing. Thanks again..."
1037263,Terry,2018-11-30 15:22:00,14456,the next bigger scotty has a counter but i can see the ball on my fishfinder so i know how deep the ball is
1037264,misfish,2018-11-30 15:22:00,29133,"Between the set up of your graph and the counter on the reel you will need to buy as a gift as well, will work."
1037266,Tomcat,2018-11-30 15:48:00,395,The Scotty 1050 Depthmaster has a counter - see http://scotty.com/product/no-1050-depthmaster-23/
1037267,Sinker,2018-11-30 16:07:00,8692,"The scotty 1050 is what I have, with the portable clamp on mount. It has a counter and works great.  I run 10lb cannonballs off it no problem.  S."
1037268,misfish,2018-11-30 16:19:00,29133,"I'm not rowing and pulling a 10lb ball Shane. LOL My transducer holder can be locked in position with just a turn of the screw. No matter where the ball is,I will be able to lock down on it."
1037269,Headhunter,2018-11-30 16:52:00,5703,https://www.offshoretackle.com/OR20.html Poor man's downrigger... HH
1037270,BillM,2018-11-30 17:47:00,17367,"Even better, a 3way rig with a 3-5oz lead attached.   Doesn't get much easier and very effective for lakers."
1037276,Headhunter,2018-11-30 20:02:00,5703,"Bill, the plastic clips look better in the water. HH"
1037278,porkpie,2018-11-30 22:30:00,2521,"I like counters on everything.  Rigger, reel etc.  That way if I was catching fish 42 down and 85 feet off the ball I can get back to that instantly without counting passes or watching a screen.  I wouldn't own a rigger without a line counter but everyone's different."
