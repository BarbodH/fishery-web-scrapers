Can you recommend good reasonable taxidermist in the West side of GTA. Milton/Brampton/Acton/Mississauga//Oakville area. Never used such a service before so can use some advice. What would it cost for head and neck mount? Straight? Looking to the side? What would be best type to do?  Thanks,  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

As far as I understand Joe's son followed in his footsteps and is excellent. Google Martin Taxidermy Ontario. This is a skill that is one of those ""you get what you pay for""Â  I have a Tiger Musky Joe did way back in 1983. It looks like it just came out of the water to this day. I found it but can't paste here for some reason. I Googled Joe Martin Taxidermy. It's either Joe Jr or Joe is still going strong."

This is because most have to send the hide for tanning. I chose artistry in motion in uxbridge. A little more money but the best work I've seen. Also a saffari guide , you see his work every time you go to bass pro. They do the tanning on site and your animal back to you in 3-4 months."
