Ended up catching a bunch of them and a new personal best! Beautiful fish who fight harder than a Smallmouth Bass! The colours are breathtaking on them and they're really not a bass but a Cichlid! If you're ever around Miami, I would definitely go catch a bunch!     "

1037674,David Chong,2018-12-08 21:14:00,836,It’s actually at the back of my cousin’s house in Miami!
1037675,GBW,2018-12-08 21:54:00,8460,So your fuel millage was really good then to get to the honey hole from his place! Nice fish and congrats on a new PB
1037683,lickmyarmpit,2018-12-09 04:15:00,359,Wicked bars on that one fish looks like a giant perch. Nice fish.

1037732,Acountdeleted,2018-12-10 12:15:00,2562,Very nice. I'd love to hook into one of those.  Aren't bass in the chiclid family though?
