I have no idea why he bought new as he has a heated quansit building complete with a hydraulic lift. All I will say because this isn't the Dodge/Ford/Chevy which is best thread, he said he made a huge mistake, especially when he had to pay a 100 bucks for an oil service he could do in his sleep to maintain his warranty."

Mom is from North Tonawanda NY. When we were very little there was a huge Pulp and Paper mill as well as an old Bethlehem Steel plant that we had to pass on the Niagara River to get into town. I always wished the road was blocked when the Switchman would spread their arms holding the coal lamp to stop traffic. A drag of 100 ton Cling ladles filled with molten iron would cross the road, often sparks would fly up when the Hogger stopped the train, cool to see for a 7 year old. Fast forward to 1977 when I was asked if I would be interested in going into Blast Furnace operations and eventually working at the new Nanticoke plant on Lake Erie. The General Foreman then, Mr. Bill Taylor said to me ""Son if you choose to work in the Blast Furnaces you will have a job for life."" Not wanting to be a wise ass I carefully told Mr. Taylor that wasn't true. In the early 70's they knocked down those WW1 and a WW2 era furnaces and turned the brownfield into a park and Marina. over 30,000 good paying jobs were gone in a blink in Western NY when Bethlehem and several smaller steel plants just simply vanished by 1974. The greenfield site where Bethlehem stood in Lackawanna NY west of Buffalo will soon be the largest manufacturer of Solar panels in the World. That's the plan anyway."
1037415,SirCranksalot,2018-12-03 22:45:00,3291,"When I hear someone use the term ""permanent job' I will correct them if I know them reasonably well-----such an oxymoron!! "

1037430,Old Ironmaker,2018-12-04 01:31:00,8243,"Most of the guys my age always say we were born at the right time, 1950's. If you went down Burlington St. on a bus in Steeltown and got off at the wrong stop one could walk to the wrong front office of any plant and get a shift job for 30 to 40 years with benefits and a pension. That time was the closest one could say "" I have a permanent job."" Even then though many were severed off in the 90's a few years or less short of pensions. Many of the guys I worked with that had no plans of retiring that had more than 30 years in would get a tap on the shoulder from someone out of the Pittsburg office and were asked ""What do you do here?"" If they didn't have a good answer the bean counter would congratulate them on their retirement if they qualified. I had never reached into my pocket to pay for anything health related in my entire life until a few years ago. US Steel Canada cut medical benefits by 100%. Thankfully we got most of them back when Bedrock Industries bought us from US Steel. I got a small taste of what it is like to have to pay for major medical, Rx drugs and dental like both my brothers and their families. A sobering experience to say the least and a new empathy for those that don't get good if any medical benefits from their employers. I am sure there are many on this board today with young families that must pay for medical benefits out of their net earnings. It has to be a tough go of it for certain."

Now I have a job with medical, dental and prescription coverage and most important a pension!!!! I lived for the day my entire life and never saved a penny. The pension offered from my employer will actually allow me to retire. Just wish I found the position 10 years earlier as I would be able to retire with a full pension, but I can live quite comfortably on the amount I will earn from it. Especially when combined with CPP & OAS. For most of my working life I found it more important to have a job I could take leave from to head to the Arctic to guide for 2 months a year. Being happy and chasing fish was more important the the all mighty dollar. Foolish, maybe but I have enjoyed my life and when all is said and done I won't be saying I wish I had done this or done that. Because I did them."

1037450,crappieperchhunter,2018-12-04 15:20:00,2582,"Since this topic  has moved into pensions I would strongly suggest anyone working and close to retirement look into the option of taking a commuted pension, especially if your companies pension fund is already in an underfunded state.  I did this and retired at the end of June. The first week of October I got my lump sum commuted pension in the form of 2 separate cheques. My employer of 36 years has been declining all over North America much the same as GM  and they even have a 5 year loan from our government right now to help pay their pensioners.  I was truly concerned that someday getting a pension from them would disappear. The pros. I got my money. If the company goes under now it will have no effect on me. The amount I got was  the equivalent of 25 years of what I would have received as a monthly pension. I can invest it how I see fit. The cons. Lost all my benefits when I severed my ties with the company.  If you have no coverage elsewhere...like a spouse with benefits...or you have expensive medical/dental issues this could be a problem. Do your homework and figure out what is best for you because in my experience you will  always do better for yourself then somebody else will."

I've made up that 1000 bucks doing things I enjoyed doing not working 50 to 60 hours a week and on call 24/7 with zero overtime and zero bonuses. Companies under bankruptcy protection don't usually give out bonuses for middle management. As far as any vehicle that runs on anything all I want to know is how much $ per km. I don't care if it's horse manure if it's less than any other fuel and stays less I'll buy one if the ROI is worth it. Gas is 98.9 here in Cayuga On. today. I don't think Hydro is less per KM.

Now imagine a 2x or 3x price increase on those items. The only way out of this mess is to slowly limit imports to encourage local manufacturing and generate jobs; while incurring moderate price increases only.

A rapidly changing automotive sector, ridiculous antics by governments on both sides of the border, high energy costs, and a consumer that demands more for less have all created an environment where GM needed to reduce operations, and Oshawa unfortunately is one of the multiple plants they have decided to  shut down. It sucks for the people directly involved, but we need to ask ourselves is it more worthwhile to prop up an unsustainable business model by throwing good money after bad?

They say there are 6 or 7 jobs created to support each job at GM so 7 x 2500 = 17500 jobs wild guess average $30K per year = $525M x 20 % tax = $105M PER YEAR in taxes going to the government. And the bailout was ten years ago. So that's $1.05B. Add 2500 gm jobs at a round $50K per year (and most pay more than that), 30% tax rate and that's another $37.5M per year or $375M. Now add all the sales taxes generated when those salaries are spent. And then add the taxes on the profit that spending generates. And finally if GM wasn't bailed out and had folded the Gov would have spent hundreds of millions per year or more on social assistance and retraining. On the balance of things I'd say it could have been worse.  *not sure why my font went all wonky there sorry"

A lot of the parts that go into a car aren't made by an actual auto company. There used to be dozens of metal stamping factories  in the Cleveland are that made various pieces, spring companies, wiring, seat assembly s, and even the vinyl for the seats, floor mats, oil filters, you name it."
1037173,Tom S,2018-11-29 01:38:00,362,"Interestingly enough, Toyota attempted to teach GM their methods to success, look up the NUMMI plant in Fremont CA (which in some strange twist of fate is now the Tesla plant). Even though they were able to produce cars at the same rate and same quality as the Japanese plants GM was unable to implement the success in other plants - it ran contrary to the culture embedded in management and the workers. And so began the slow death of the American auto makers."

Everyone, including engineers, are more disposable to the NA companies. Bigger turnover, more rookies! I have a 2005 Chevy Venture. Some rookie engineer decided that a fiber mat in the wheel wells would absorb some of the noise from the tires. Unfortunately it absorbs water as well. It's not just my vehicle that rusted out in those areas. When it did looked around parking lots and could identify other Ventures from a distance by seeing their rust pattern. ?"

1037096,aplumma,2018-11-27 20:38:00,6896,I am surprised to read how many people think that this is personal. The GM pull out has nothing to do with it being Canada but everything to do with keeping the company alive and profitable. We see this all over the place in many countries even down to the the cities. A Home Depot closes down when a Lowes moves into the area then they both pull out when they are no longer selling to the new construction boom that was going on. The Lodges up North that sell or close when they people no longer want to travel that far for poor fishing conditions. Business are there to make a product that generates a profit not to make sure that the people who are employed have a job. How many times have you heard of a a man starting a business and failing meaning he has sold everything he owns of value and now has a future of debt and the hard times of rebuilding his finances. The employees then have offered to work for free and give back some of the money they earned to save the owner. This only happens in the movies folks most people say tough luck you made a grab for the brass ring and missed. Now let this man create a business that makes him rich and now he is the bad guy because he has been rewarded for taking the chance and making smarts decisions. Art
1037099,misfish,2018-11-27 21:43:00,29133,"Art I have been with this company for 24 years now. It was super profiting when I started. Profit sharing to every employee was great. Then the slow hit. Still the company plugged along. Profit sharing  slowly dwindled then stopped. Some were not happy. I was happy to have a job. A pay stub at the end of every 2 weeks. I would sooner give up the profit share then lose my job. Company hit a low. Had to cut days and use UI to compensate for lost wages, yet no one was let go. They even cut the ground crew that took care of the property. They asked if I would take it over. They bought a lawn tractor,mower,wiper sniper, and I did it for a full summer.  Twice a week. After that one year, we started to pick up again. Everyone back to 40 hour weeks. Slowly we got back to full swing. Profit sharing had come back bit by bit. Restructuring was the big come back. After all this, we are back to getting customers coming to us. Like I mentioned before, we are expanding, and going to get busy. Having an owner that cares makes a world of difference. Family owned.  Proud to be a member of this family."
1037101,chris.brock,2018-11-27 22:18:00,4053,"I hear ya Art, but it's the $3.5 bill grant from the tax payers to bail out GM in 2009 that makes their decision to close Oshawa a little personal and disappointing."

1037109,aplumma,2018-11-28 00:31:00,6896,"I love to hear things like this Brian when a company is so close to the employees that it is a family type atmosphere. I have found this is possible when a company is small enough to stay in touch with each other and they have the family picnics and know the employees family members by name. The reality is when a company goes from this to being a company with shareholders and policies that affect 100's to 1,000's of employees it has to be done with a broad sweeping brush that does not try to make everyone happy but tries to give something to everyone while protecting the shareholders that they answer too. I am not saying it is fair nor will I say it is always right but it is the way business is done. I have stocks as most of us do and if a company keeps losing money whether the reason is it is trying to be nice to the employees or it is failing for any reason we will pull out of the company as an investor. The deals that may have been made in the past had a way for GM to legally close the plant regardless of if it has or has not repaid the debt to ?Canada? Sorry I do not know anything about the loan so I can't speak on it. If they are walking away from a debt then it appears the penalty for doing that is less than telling the shareholders that they lost 4-6 billion dollars. I will watch to see how this unfolds because it appears there is a piece missing. A major company does not close down a division in a foreign country unless it is no longer profitable to keep it there. It could be union demands are excessive, the cost of electricity and materials are to high, or government subsidies are being lessened and eating away at the profits. The biggest and hardest thing for people to do is to distance themselves mentally from the fact that a business has to survive first before it can have any compassion for the employees. While harsh it is business 101 similar to cutting off a gangrene rotting foot to save the life of the person. It is not the first choice nor a pleasant choice that has repercussions down the line but the person lives to fight another day.  Art"

1037124,LeXXington,2018-11-28 15:24:00,1928,Canada bought GM stock to prop up the company.  This is done based on Capital exposure.  When the stock is worthless companies are forced into bankruptcy by Canada owning stock it added stability.   Once GM was stable Canada sold the stock in small amounts over time.  Canada owns no stock.  Since they do not have any stock they lose the rights of a shareholder to have any say.

With so many robots, daily one or more of them often gets buggered up and won't function and causes plenty of down time. Sometimes they need a special part from the US to be repaired to get things moving again. I've seen small parts being flown up by helicopter just to get production going again asap.

And in GM's case when the trucks cost just as much...sounds to me like you are only selling trucks to people that have always bought a GM just because Japan meant garbage back in they day...doesnt sound like a great business model to me. Visit Japan, you will immediately understand why their automotive sector is doing just fine. They do almost absolutely everything better than us, except play hockey. (infastructure, transit, education, pollution etc etc.) Hard work is embedded in their culture, good luck competing with people that feel like working yourself to death is an honourable thing to do...no joke.

1037129,grimsbylander,2018-11-28 16:15:00,3016,"Hey Chris, I've done a lot of marketing research in the area of robotics and automation. This is my last week in this job (start with a new company on Monday!) but we manufacture machined components for one of the worlds largest robot manufacturers. Part of this research showed just how involved robotics will be in the very near future and surprisingly, just how many NEW jobs will be created because of them. Yes, robotics will eliminate many jobs but as you pointed out, they don't operate autonomously and the amount of service, programming, repair, design, setup, etc. jobs will be massive. In fact, industry experts are predicting that for people will to retrain, the introduction of robotics will offer them greater employment opportunity both in volume and compensation. Robotics are N. America's answer to low cost offshore labour and without them, we cannot compete and the downhill slide will continue. Even those job functions you mentioned requiring a human's touch will soon be influenced by automation. Google the term cobot if you're unfamiliar. They are robots designed to work directly and safely with humans through the use of pneumatics and pressure sensors. Not trying to sound callous or uncaring but I've working in manufacturing my entire working career and seen the slow, deliberate downslide here in N. America at all levels. The last company I managed got ""right-sized"" (crappy term for permanent layoffs) and under direction of the owner we went from 106 employees to 16. The jobs got moved to Poland where skilled 5 axis machinists were being paid $6 an hour. In Ontario this story is extremely common and the number of lost jobs at the small business levels total WELL beyond the 3000 employees at GM and the spin-offs. These companies do not get government subsidies or tax breaks. They don't get news teams showing up and they don't have union leaders threatening to fight the closings. They don't have employees making $60/hour for simple task procedures and they don't walk off the job in protest. In Ontario, for the majority of people the death of manufacturing has been silent. To be frank, it seems a little silly to act surprised or outraged that a company such as GM has decided to rid itself of the shackles of a union that was more than willing to kill the golden goose."

What about the rest of my pickups and closing times? We will get someone else to cover those, just get to the airport! So I get to the airport and they direct me to a small plane, like a piper cub, and we had to unload like 3-4 hundred pounds of small metal parts onto the floor of the plane, he couldn't take more because of the weight, and they needed them quickly to prevent an assembly line shutdown. Expensive? yes, but having hundreds of people standing around because of a lack of parts is too. At another larger trucking company I worked for it wasn't all that unusual for a helicopter to land in our yard  to pickup critical parts to avoid a shutdown of an assembly line.

More cuts came under the so-called Government Motors era, and thousands more jobs were lost when Oshawa’s consolidated plant was closed.

So many thoughts bouncing around my head about GM shutting down. So many factors leading up to this closure. -Cost of living and debt levels have risen faster than wages, causing a push for higher wages. Used to be able to buy a house working a job with just a high school education, not so much these days. But at the same time we're responsible for the rising cost of living as our culture of consumerism constantly raises our living standards as we want more stuff and are encouraged to borrow more and more. -Between the drive clean program and the 0% financing that was available during the economic crisis more people are driving new cars than ever. Leading to a slump in sales, since most people who were looking to replace a car have responded to incentives. Probably saw growth through the early millennium, with a plateau shortly after the recession. They managed to keep the plants running, but it's hurting them now. -I feel that the manufacturers and the dealerships don't have the same goals in mind. Things such as selling cars at below purchase price in order to meet sales targets, so that the dealership receives the bonuses required in order be profitable. (Excellent podcast for any interested in dealership shenanigans -> https://www.thisamericanlife.org/513/129-cars . -Cars are so complex and technologically advanced these days that prices become astronomical. Once again we're the source of our own problem, as consumers want gadgets and gizmos; and the environmental regulations require complicated control systems. Not saying that environmental regulations are necessarily bad in and of themselves, but can be taken past the point of common sense. I think that we're going to see a lot of cars scapped in the future because of electronics issues, costs a lot to buy the auto upfront and costs a lot to troubleshoot and repair the computerized modules when they break down."

1037065,LeXXington,2018-11-27 02:57:00,1928,There is a business case for the closing.  You just can't compete in Canada in manufacturing. Tossing more money after bad is not going to help. GM can close the plant as they said.. but I think they still own Canada a bit https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/loans-canada-account-finance-auto-sector-bailout-2009-gm-chrysler-1.4722529 Don't let them take one piece of hardware to move it to Mexico until they paid back our Money. As for the loss of jobs.  I have known a number of companies getting rid of employee's and not a word from government but when its the auto sector its different? Ask someone in Alberta how the Feds are helping them https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/100000-jobless-energy-workers-struggle-for-a-place-in-the-new-economy Job losses are going to be the new norm for a few years to come until Canada starts acting like a country and standing up for the middle class. This is not a USA / Mexico / Canada / China  issue.  It's we just need fair policy and environment to compete. This weird notion that the high tech sector will save us all ended in 2001 when they figured off-shoring was cheaper than workers in Canada. Until our leaders realize that you can only hire so many new government workers before you run out of money expect more of the same.        
1037067,OhioFisherman,2018-11-27 03:43:00,6623,"My youngest daughter went to Ohio State University in Columbus Ohio and graduated about 4 years ago. Since I am severely disabled I couldn't attend the ceremony, but did watch it live streamed on line, that was an eye opener! OSU is the largest, or at least one of the top 5 largest, colleges in our country and it seemed like most of the students graduating with PHD degrees were foreign, and their degrees seemed to be in fields that actually meant something. No intent to demean any educational attempt intended, but the subject matter was revealing."
1037068,OhioFisherman,2018-11-27 03:56:00,6623,As long as one country on this planet allows wages for the same job that are significantly lower than others there will be a rush to  exploit that advantage? Even if all our workers had college educations the push would still be there to maximize profits seeking cheaper help elsewhere?
1037070,dave524,2018-11-27 09:53:00,4508,"The big factor that no one is mentioning in the loss of manufacturing is the high price of electric power today , historically cheap power starting with the development of Niagara Falls was the drawing card here. I worked on an environmental assessment of the Nanticoke site before the power plant was built many years ago, watched as Stelco and others were drawn there for the power, that era is over."
1037073,DanD,2018-11-27 12:42:00,2223,"My son is an engineer working for GM at the technical center in Warren Michigan. He was sent to the truck assembly plant in Texas; to find out why some of these trucks had a server engine vibration. What he found was that some of the frames were not parallel to each other; causing the engine mounts to be stretched or crushed to their limits. After some investigating he also found that all the frames that came out of St Thomas Ontario were perfect. The bad frames were all made in Mexico. So you ask my son what he thinks of out sourcing, to save a few bucks. He spent a few weeks down there to come up with wedge shims to be placed between the frame perches and mounts to center the engines. When he got back he asked Chevrolet's lead engineer if the bean counters were going to be held accountable; rather then his engineering department. All he got from his boss was shrugged shoulders. Dan."
1037076,grimsbylander,2018-11-27 13:15:00,3016,I can see why Stelco would move closer to Nanticoke back in the day when companies were not thinking global. It's not the case today though and the cost of power in the pacific rim is on par or even higher than in N. America. The attraction to offshore manufacturing is material prices and labour which is allowing them the economic luxury of developing robust supply chains.
1037080,Old Ironmaker,2018-11-27 15:01:00,8243,"I'm not surprised at all. We went through this 15 years ago at Stelco. GM simply isn't going to sell anymore Impalas, Caddy SUV's and big 1/2 tons that Oshawa makes. Self driving and electrical/hybrids is the way of the future, and that is what GM said about the closing. It's not 2000 job losses, it's more like 20,000 plus ancillary jobs."
1037083,Rattletrap2,2018-11-27 16:38:00,1652,"Yes, but they are closing down other Ontario plants. The total number of people employed by Maple Leaf is going down!"
1037086,Whitespinnerbait,2018-11-27 17:17:00,2038,"Finally , someone has put an end to $60 an hour to install windshield wiper blades or to screw on a tail light etc etc."
1037088,misfish,2018-11-27 17:30:00,29133,"We stamp and fine blank millions of parts a year for the auto sector. We ship pretty much world wide, including Canada. We are presently expanding both plants. We do the parts that other companies do not want to do. The difficult parts."

1037002,spincast,2018-11-26 02:12:00,3279,"Sources inside the government have confirmed that a General Motors plant in Oshawa is set to close. It's unclear how many employees will lose their jobs, since this is part of a larger global restructuring plan, the sources said. In a statement, Unifor, the union representing auto workers at the plant, said they have not heard ""complete details of the overall announcement"" but were told that no cars are set to be assembled at the plant past December 2019. ""Based on commitments made during 2016 contract negotiations, Unifor does not accept this announcement and is immediately calling on GM to live up to the spirit of that agreement,"" the statement reads. The union said it would be holding talks with General Motors tomorrow. ""We have no news or comment tonight and won't be commenting to others on speculation,"" a spokesperson for GM said on Sunday. https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/gm-oshawa-plant-1.4920241"

1037017,Garnet,2018-11-26 14:42:00,2056,In the 2009 financial melt gov lent GM 25 billion for guaranteed product to 2018. GM paid back 25B a year early. And hello it's 2018. GM Oshawa has been stuck building cars for the last 15 years a declining market. They where denied opportunity to bid on suv a least a couple times. It's the 3000 jobs plus 7 jobs feeding that plant so start at 21k. Then this washes threw 3-5 teachers 1 lawyers office a cleaning company the list is endless. 
1037018,farsider,2018-11-26 14:43:00,456,"The cynical among us (eg. me) , would say this is just another ploy by GM to shakedown the Federal and provincial gov'ts for more ""investments"".  An election year for the federals.  Sad to toy with workers lives this way, plus all those tied to GM jobs."
1037019,Jds63,2018-11-26 14:44:00,1365,"In their hayday there was 30,000 workers now its 2,500 left in the plant. I worked there for just under 20 yrs in the office, was let go a few years back (part of a group of 60 salaried) in one of many downsizing efforts that has been going on for a long time. I didn't sulk and blame anyone I just moved on and found other employment. I don't blame GM for my job loss, we all knew where things were heading … companies have to adapt and change and so do we, its way the things are now … no more loyalty to 1 company and job for life mentality. Manufacturing in Ontario is a sector that has lost so many jobs in the last decade and will continue unless governments make manufacturing investment attractive. Many of my friends still there all have at least 25 yrs or more and are all being offered packages. They are also offering it to 18,000 workers in the US as well. They want a younger workforce … Won't get into if GM owes anybody anything debate…  but we are in an era of massive tech change for vehicles. Its not just other car companies but they are now competing against Google, Apple and TESLA."
1037021,crappieperchhunter,2018-11-26 16:00:00,2582,"I moved to Oshawa in 1983 and worked in a printing plant right next to the GM south plant. In 30 plus years  I have witnessed it's slow painful death.  Really surprised it has actually taken this long.  Lotsa finger pointing going on, blaming the union, blaming the company, blaming the government.  All valid points. There is no singular group to blame IMHO. It's just the reality of manufacturing in Canada in general right now and one magic pill isn't going to fix it either. I feel badly for those affected and wish them the best in moving on."
1037023,OhioFisherman,2018-11-26 16:28:00,6623,"Ford motor has a factory complex in my area, engine plants 1&2 and the Cleveland casting plant, all on one piece of land. Back in it's hey day in the 1970's there was like 12 - 13 thousand people working there, it now has like 2-3 thousand. Chevy and Chrysler also had plants in my area, a common theme for all of them was tax incentives to expand or modernize and keep those jobs in their communities, sort of like blackmail? They were given tax breaks, and to pay for them the communities created city income taxes or regional income taxes, the jobs may disappear, but those taxes never do! So now it has become give us tax breaks or we move production to a foreign land? and how many of those workers can afford to buy what they are producing? A lot of reasons though, pollution controls, robotics and others, it cheaper for them to build a new plant in a 3rd? world country than to build here."
1037025,grimsbylander,2018-11-26 17:12:00,3016,"Offshoring manufacturing has affected every market segment being made in North America. Why does anyone expect it would be different for automakers? It's an unfortunate circumstance but the reality of today. The big three are faced with a decision to either move more offshore or go under because who can afford to buy vehicles that are manufactured 100% in N. America? Or better yet, how can those vehicles compete on price with those made offshore? It's a lose lose either way. We are becoming a service nation more everyday."

1037035,grimsbylander,2018-11-26 18:33:00,3016,That's the easy question with the very difficult answer. It used to be that N/A had the technological and intellectual advantage over offshore competitors; with the exception of western/central Europe of course. Now that have leveled and mainly due to the investment made by N/A businesses. They fed information and money into those countries in order to gain advantage in home markets at the expense of manufacturing. Once that happens you can't un-ring the bell.
1037038,Toronto_Angler,2018-11-26 19:28:00,698,Its the shift in the economy. We've moved from a manufacturing economy to an information based economy. Has happened all through history and is part of progress. Yes its always terrible when people lose their jobs but unemployment is low and companies like Microsoft announce investments and job creating into the ontario economy to offset the manufacturing losses.
1037040,JoePa,2018-11-26 19:55:00,179,Well let me tell you something - you ain't seen nothing yet - wait until the full force of Artificial Intelligence and more robotics take over - all these manufacturing type jobs and manual jobs will be toast - so what do you do about it? - get some kind of skill that is not easily duplicated
