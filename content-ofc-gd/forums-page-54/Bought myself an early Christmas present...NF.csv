1035572,lew,2018-10-22 09:32:00,12766,I've always enjoyed playing pool and have a large 27' x 17' family room down stairs so finally decided to buy a table. It was delivered and installed on Friday and we had friends and family over for the weekend and had a blast breaking it in. Gonna be a great way to spend those long cold winter evenings.     
1035573,DanD,2018-10-22 10:16:00,2223,Nice looking table or should I say nice piece of furniture. Dan.
1035574,lew,2018-10-22 10:25:00,12766,"Thanks Dan and your right, it really is a nice piece of furniture entirely made with hardwood throughout."
1035575,Rustic-Fisher,2018-10-22 11:02:00,826,"Nice , just sold ours to make room for kids toys and sports equipment lol. i do however Have a Billiards type light that hung over the table . Three lamps . yours for free if you want it ? "
1035576,lew,2018-10-22 11:09:00,12766,"Thanks bud, extremely generous offer and much appreciated but the area is already well lit from above now. Goodonya to make the offer though."
1035580,Phil S C,2018-10-22 12:37:00,11,Should move pretty nice with a 60 horse on the back. Love the 6 rod holders.
1035581,crappieperchhunter,2018-10-22 13:43:00,2582,"Thats a beauty Lew. And yes it would be nice to have especially in the winter. I used to play a lot  of pool and always wanted a table.  When we built our house in 88 I specifically had a steel ""I "" beam installed so my 24 X 24 basement would have no jack posts in the entire room....leaving me lotsa room for a pool table.  Cost me a good penny extra back in the day to have this done but I wanted a pool table. Fast forward to the present and I still have no table...lol.  Still love to play but things just progressed differently and the room always ended up getting used for other things. No regrets whatsoever and I no longer want a table....but DAMN....that set up you have looks good. Enjoy it Lew. I can just imagine the hours of enjoyment you and your friends and family will get out of it."
1035593,BillM,2018-10-22 14:59:00,17367,"I was hoping I'd see a 9'6 muskie rod and Tranx 500 attached to it j/k Lew, gotta love a few rounds of pool!"
1035601,ratherboutdoors,2018-10-22 16:28:00,132,Love the felt colour!  We inherited my in-laws and put new red felt on ours following their downsize.  No pics handy but it sure doesn't hold a candle to the craftsmanship in the frame that yours has.
1035604,misfish,2018-10-22 20:11:00,29133,Nice new entertainment Lew. Played lots in my younger years. Mostly snooker. 8 ball on the smaller  tables. 
1035605,Woodsman,2018-10-22 20:54:00,1286,Nice. Lots of future fun there. 
1035607,lew,2018-10-22 21:48:00,12766,"Thanks boyz, I'm lookin forward to many enjoyable evenings at the table."
1035608,Fisherman,2018-10-22 22:01:00,7201,"A very nice addition but when it comes to billiards, I couldn't sink a ball unless I tilted the table.  ?"
1035611,Rizzo,2018-10-22 23:45:00,4754,wow that is a beauty!
1035612,farsider,2018-10-23 01:38:00,456,"Nicely done sir!  She's a beaut! Cheers, Mark"
1035615,AKRISONER,2018-10-23 13:53:00,5558,"had a pool table in my parents house growing up, one summer my best friend and I would hang out every day and play a game of pool, then a game of madden, then bike to his house and go swimming, then come back and repeat. We did this for an entire summer, and that winter I was staying at horseshoe resort for a ski trip with my friends family and there was a ""pool"" event where you could compete in a tournament...turns out that playing 10 games of pool every day for 2 months straight turns you into a pretty good pool player lol. I was 14 years old and beat everyone haha."
1035617,bigbuck,2018-10-23 14:44:00,2449,"With a couple of logs burning and your bevvie of choice, many an enjoyable evening will be spent there. A light directly over the table adds to the ambiance. Just saying."
1035981,lunkerbasshunter,2018-11-02 15:03:00,2585,I still play a lot of pool.  Love the game!  Its a great way to spend a winters night! Cheers!
1036330,Rattletrap2,2018-11-11 03:27:00,1652,Beautiful addition to the room Lew! Enjoy!
1036333,Old Ironmaker,2018-11-11 06:19:00,8243,"I know tables and that Sir is top notch. I always had a table, when I was single. It appears smacking balls around in the middle of the night keeps people awake. The best table I had was a 3X6 and took loonies to play. Buddies had to buck up to play."
1036720,David Chong,2018-11-19 21:59:00,836,Truly a beauty!
1037412,Old Ironmaker,2018-12-03 22:14:00,8243,"Ain't that true. I built new in 86'. I/we paid a pretty penny too to have the garage  bumped out an extra 5' so I could keep my future boat nice and dry inside. I finally bought the boat in 2005, no garage."
1037505,plowjock,2018-12-05 14:07:00,4,"I once knew a girl who had legs like that table. Beautiful piece of work, the table that is."
1037506,LeXXington,2018-12-05 14:39:00,1928,Wow nice table!!
