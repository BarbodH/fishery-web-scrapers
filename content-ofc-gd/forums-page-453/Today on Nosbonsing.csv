654170,Rod Caster,2012-01-07 00:09:00,5784,"Bassassin and I went out for an evening fish on Nosbonsing. The bite was slow and light but we did manage three nice keepers.  The best thing about the night was the weather... somewhere around -5, very light winds, a cool layer of fog and a bright moon. we fished past 6 and caught our last fish at 530.  Good times.    "
