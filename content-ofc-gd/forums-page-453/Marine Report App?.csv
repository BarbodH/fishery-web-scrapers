I already have the Weather Network, but was wondering if there are others out there that anyone would recommend.  Thanks.  Zeeter"

I'm a crane operator, at times I may sit holding a load for an extensive period of time & this releives the boredom.  Sorry can't help with a marine forecast.  I do know U can get an app similar to Navionics gold chip which shows the great lakes & Simcoe.  Costs $15.00.  Have fun."
