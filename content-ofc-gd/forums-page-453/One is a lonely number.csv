654648,Leecher,2012-01-08 20:21:00,7832,Nice chrome Brian   It's all worth it in the end Great job my friend
654651,Rustic-Fisher,2012-01-08 20:31:00,826,Nice One. Good thing you toughed it out
654657,Terry,2012-01-08 20:57:00,14456,one is better then what I got today  and it took me 2 hours of driving to get there
654661,misfish,2012-01-08 20:59:00,29133,"Thanks fellas. I got that one in a pool I have fished alot and never got a thing from it. I decided to fish it, cause the sun was hitting that bend and it warmed me up.LOL  I have never fished this late on the river,even back when I use to do it alot. It,s tough conditions and the bite is real slow. Looking at the forcast this week,it may get a bit dirty for the comeing weekend. If Simcoe dont harden up soon,guess this will be my choice. Not that Im complaining."
654665,misfish,2012-01-08 21:12:00,29133,"  I,ll bet the 20 minute drive yesterday felt better.LOL  Check in with me Monday bud."
654746,NAW,2012-01-09 01:48:00,4022,Right on.  Nice chromer.  Makes it worth freezing your  cheeks off!
654750,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-09 01:57:00,10439,Good on ya!!! I remember back in the day I would hit the river every chance I got. I particularly remember one frosty February day. Was fishing in -10 temps and standing on an ice shelf in my floater suit and warm boots when the shelf gave way and I ended up in the river!!! I climbed out and continued fishing for about 3 more hours and never had a hit!!! I also couldn't get the two frozen blocks of ice that used to be my boots off either.
654772,Rod Caster,2012-01-09 03:19:00,5784,Good one Brian. 4 hours freezing is better than 4 hours working!
