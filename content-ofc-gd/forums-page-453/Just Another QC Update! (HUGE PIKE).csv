654230,Leecher,2012-01-07 02:02:00,7832," Somehow I don't believe that    My tipups, combined with the latest technology   (plastic reels) are the best there is for any type of fish   HEHEHE  I hear ya about the rods... got a few of them too    Caught some decent fishes on them... but nothing beats a good old fashion tipup  Glad you liked them    Doing fine and tomorrow going to target some little beauties Tight lines mon chum!!!"
654332,lhousesoccer,2012-01-07 17:10:00,442,"That's a beauty Esox!  Out of curiosity, what are you hanging under ice for bait?  Sucker?  Whitefish?  Smelt?  Dead or alive?"
654410,Fishing 24/7,2012-01-07 22:19:00,709,"  DEAD suckers, shinners and those other stupid looking minnow that loose there scale easely.....   OVER SIZED!"
654418,northernpike56,2012-01-07 22:41:00,717,that pike is so fat!! nice job!!!
654433,TroutnMuskieHunter,2012-01-07 23:13:00,1362," Too bad they weren't hitting our ""dead"" suckers, shinners and those other stupid looking minnow when we went out Kevin..."
654604,lhousesoccer,2012-01-08 16:51:00,442,"Well - you've got it figured out!  You need access to waters that grow pike like that first to be able to catch them, then you gotta figure it out.  Nice job!  One last question - I generally hang my dead bait a foot or so off the bottom, generally on flats close to drop offs.  However, I've heard from a number of people that putting a big dead sucker or something just under the ice, like a foot under, works great - even if you're over 20, 30 or 40 feet of water.  The theory is the pike cruise right under the ice looking for dead fish, which will often float rather than sink, and get pinned just under the ice.  I'm going to try that this year.  Have you ever done it?"
654626,Fishing 24/7,2012-01-08 19:06:00,709,"  Negative on that sir.  iv never tried this technique.....  will i try this... you got me thinking.  drop off work good. but hear this, pike are territorial in the late fall and in the winter. they find an erea that have all the food they need and will stick to it.  this is how i found my spot while fishing in the fall with my flipping jig in 30 FOW around a Hump or shoal, mixed with tall cabage and milfoi on the bottom.  find there feeding ground..... put a BIG dead minnow of anytype in there face.... and you WILL have one of the best pike outting in your life.  NOo ne told me this when i was pike fishing . had to figure this one out by myself.  and then add the quick strike rig and the rod and reel BRRRRACKETS... man your in for a day you wont forget. trust me"
654627,Fishing 24/7,2012-01-08 19:08:00,709,  steve iv long forgat this brutal day and put this behind me.  ill be fishing your bay alot when the ice unfreeze.  for gar.  and id love to drop by your house for a beer and for some quick info. knowing youd live on these part of the river all your life. ... are you in for a goos gar outting this srping ?!??!?

654734,bucktail,2012-01-09 01:18:00,1857,"NIce fish dude!!  Try the ""floater"" pattern at last ice when all the floating dead fish are released from the ice, pike start using this easy pattern big time just in time for prespawn and the final push for free calories to help those eggs develop.
