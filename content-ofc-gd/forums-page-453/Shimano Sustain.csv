654528,Acal57,2012-01-08 05:58:00,10,I know Shimano redesigned the sustain and released the FG model this year so I'm hoping some of the old FEs will go on clearance. Anyone know an online source or better yet a Canadian one that's clearing out old sustain reels? I'm hoping to get a bomb diggity reel for cheap.
