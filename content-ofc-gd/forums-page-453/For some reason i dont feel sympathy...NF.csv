654889,Flappn,2012-01-09 16:06:00,245,I don't understand how any body could bungee jump...I just don't get it.

655081,pics,2012-01-10 00:33:00,1268,To do it in a third world country..crazy!!! Some people just love the adrenelin rush......
655090,captpierre,2012-01-10 00:52:00,2521,Should have had her rod with her
655093,Live2fish85,2012-01-10 01:00:00,1633, Australia isn't a third world country. It is a first world.  Also some would say you have higher chances of an accident driving.
655100,pics,2012-01-10 01:12:00,1268, It happened in Zimbabwe...I wouldn't trust them.....
655108,Live2fish85,2012-01-10 01:26:00,1633,  My appologies. These meds must be effecting me more then I realize lol. I could have swore it was Australia but nope. Saying that I wouldn't trust there gear neither.
655116,pics,2012-01-10 01:53:00,1268,It's all good...The inspections etc. couldn't possibly be up to the same standards we are used to....
655126,Live2fish85,2012-01-10 02:14:00,1633,That is forsure. Makes you wonder if they even inspect there stuff. I doubt that they have near the regs that we have.
