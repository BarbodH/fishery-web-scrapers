654011,BillM,2012-01-06 17:03:00,17367,I think the biggest issue people have with Bearing Buddies is that they over fill them.   We've always used them on our trailers and never an issue.  Although an annual inspection is always a great idea.
654017,scugpg,2012-01-06 17:24:00,1373," I check the hubs on long trips also.  RobV - I believe he can get imported and domestic stuff. The ones I've used are RKF, I believe they are imported but never had an issue. There is also a Canada Bearing in London which might be worth a call.  I believe most failures are due to neglect and not where they are made. However its always a good idea to visually inspect/spin them before installing."
654025,Dabluz,2012-01-06 18:00:00,701,"Since I didn't know what bearing buddies were, I checked the internet.  From what I can see, they are just dust caps through which you can squeeze some grease.  Prices vary from a few dollars to over 40 dollars each.  Which to buy?  I haven't been very lucky with my trailer.  When I got my trailer, the first thing I did was change the bearings.  Not long after, one of the bearings gave up the ghost and damaged my hub.  Since then, the trailer has been free of trouble for over 1 year.  One thing for sure, I'm going to remove the bearings in the spring, clean everything in varsol and re-install everything if I find no damage.  Maybe I will take no chances and replace the bearings."
654028,Billy Bob,2012-01-06 18:10:00,5865, IF you replace the bearing you must replace the race also....
654048,rob v,2012-01-06 19:23:00,535,"If a person was going to the trouble of taking the whole thing apart, cleaning etc why not spend the few dollars to replace bearings, race & seals ?"
654064,davey buoy,2012-01-06 20:09:00,5505,"Your right Rob V, it's not like you change them every year ."
654131,Billy Bob,2012-01-06 22:44:00,5865," Every time this issue comes up, I thought, that by the posting here, that most were in fact changing wheel bearings every year....  Now to get the Worry Warts going......when is the last time you checked...cleaned or replace your wheel bearings on your tow vehicle...."
654133,irishfield,2012-01-06 22:46:00,26272,Exactly Bob.. and most of the new stuff is a one shot deal when you assemble the hub.. it either seats correctly or it doesn't. There is nothing to service until it disintigrates as you can't lube them like a good old 70's spindle bearing.
654160,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-06 23:51:00,10439,And if you have one of them fancy new trailers with the sealed oil filled hubs you just look at the hub windo to see that it still has oil in it. If it doesn't you might wanna fix it before going anywhere.
654268,Sinker,2012-01-07 05:24:00,8692,"One tip I was given a long time ago, is to check/inpspect/change your bearings in the fall. The most damage occurs over the winter. If they sit all winter with water in them, they rust, and fail when you use them agian in the spring.  If you clean/repack/replace them in the fall, you know for sure there is no moisture in there, and your good to go come ice out.  Theoretically, if your seals are good, you have no worries. If your seals are leaking, I'd be checking your bearings more frequently, just to make sure.  S."
654281,davey buoy,2012-01-07 11:32:00,5505,I also like using the Marine and Trailer wheel bearing grease in the tube for your grease gun. They say it holds in place longer and keeps water from penetrating.
654282,scugpg,2012-01-07 12:01:00,1373, I use the amsoil water resistant grease and it works great.
654289,fish_fishburn,2012-01-07 13:21:00,1311,"I have the same bearings on my bassboat trailer since new and that was in 96. A couple pumps with the grease gun twice a season and they are still working good. Most people with bearing buddies over fill them with grease and have grease all over the place. a couple pumps means two not 5 or 6. Just until the disc on the front starts to move and your good to go. I do jack the wheels every spring just to give em a spin and check the play. I went through the grease all over the place thingy as well and was told I was over filling the buddies, since then no issues."
654291,Billy Bob,2012-01-07 13:29:00,5865,"One question for those who use Bearing Buddies (I don' use them).  If you apply grease once or twice a season, where did the grease go that you are already suppose to have in that hub ? ? ?...."
654299,skeeter,2012-01-07 14:09:00,1907,"Good question Bob. The grease in bearings is like the oil in an engine. The hair on a mans head. The 32"" waistline. The money you had hidden to buy new tackle. The chocolate bar hidden in the back of the fridge. :dunno:"
654321,scugpg,2012-01-07 15:58:00,1373," The grease settles in the hub and the second application just fills it in. They work well as long as you don't over grease and the spring mechanism is in working order.  I use them, but think its a waste of grease. Having the bearings packed with clean grease is the important thing not filing the hub around them. when the hub is full it does help slow water doing damage if there is a seal or buddy failure."
654341,Wolf 3,2012-01-07 18:03:00,134,"I like these new Vortex hubs, http://www.tiedown.com/pdf/c1157.pdf.  At the end of the season you just pump new grease through the ""internal lubrication system""."
654362,Fisherman,2012-01-07 19:30:00,7201," New? Ancient technology, been around since Ben Hur.  I can remember seeing hubs with grease nipples on both sides to lube the bearings.  Only problem with them is the same as the bearing buddies, now and the you would blow out the rear seal."
654378,Sinker,2012-01-07 20:22:00,8692,"Check out the EZ lube axles.  I put a new axle on my trailer, with the EZ lube system. It looks pretty slick, but I haven't had it on there long enough to have to check or repack them. Just pump the grease in the fitting like a bearing buddy,only it sends the grease thru the spindle to the inside bearing, and out to the outer bearing where there is a vent hole. Should work mint, but like I said, I haven't had to touch them yet. Canadian made as well!  http://www.cerka.ca/catalog/EZLUBE.asp  S."
654384,smally21,2012-01-07 20:52:00,993,"sinker i used EZ lube exclusively on hundreds of trailers. its the easiest, highest quality system i came across. it is fairly inexpensive when having the axle built.  lubes both sides of the bearing, which some systems dont. its designed to be overfilled, and some grease just spooges out, kind of like your lower unit.  id pick this system over bearing buddies."
654427,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-07 22:56:00,10439," Yeah, they work great. Puts the grease in between the bearings in stead of trying to force it all through the outer bearing. Does a much better job lubing the inside bearing."
654519,Sinker,2012-01-08 04:41:00,8692,"yeah, it was fairly inexpensive. I got a 2500lb axle with hubs/bearings/EZlube for just over $200. Pretty cheap IMO. So far, so good, but I haven't really put it thru its paces yet. Its been on there for just over a year now with no issues so far, and I haven't even looked at the bearings, but i can't see any reason that I should have to. I haven't added any grease....I've never even taken the dust caps off. I've put at least 5000km on it by now...easily.  S."
654546,Billy Bob,2012-01-08 10:29:00,5865,"I had the EZ Lube axle on my '06 pop up trailer....seemed to work very good....took it out west that year and did 6500 mile in 30 days without any problems....every time we stopped I would put the back of my hand on the hubs and they were warm at the most....even in 108 degree temps.  The one caution I will say....when you have a new trailer, check the bearing right away....mine had so LITTLE grease in the bearings/hub it was a joke."
653818,rob v,2012-01-06 02:03:00,535,"I know this subject comes up about once a week .... but I wanted to ask.  I bought my boat and trailer used 3 years ago.  The boat and trailer ( I'm not 100% sure about the trailer) was about 5 years old then so I'm guessing it's about 8 yrs old now.  When I bought it I noticed the grease smears on the insides of the tire rims - the tell tale sign that bearing seals were compromised.  The wheels have bearing buddies.   So I kept a close eye on them.   I don't trailer too much - not many long trips -  but haven't noticed any problems with them what so ever.  No heat, no play, no bearing noise etc.  I've also kept an eye on the grease levels, making sure not to over-fill them.  I haven't noticed any new grease escape since I've owned the unit.  I'm trying to decide whether it's worth the trouble to change and repack the bearings/seals - or should I just keep an eye on them.  I don't have a good spot to do this job myself (no shop etc) conveniently.  Is it possible the bearings may have been over-filled with grease some time in the past but have not lost their seal ?"
653821,irishfield,2012-01-06 02:06:00,26272,"Yes you can overpressurize a seal.. puke grease out of it and still cause it no damage. Considering what you've said.. you've kept the grease cavities filled and no future sign of leakage.. I'd say they're good. Jack the wheel.. rock and roll..no play or noise, carry on!"
653826,livinisfishin,2012-01-06 02:09:00,661,Regular mainenance is something I wish I would have paid attention to a year ago..ended up changing both bearings in my works parking lot last summer....
653838,mike rousseau,2012-01-06 02:20:00,4661,He might have blown a bearing at some point in time and replaced the bearing... But didn't clean the rim...  Grease will stick to a rim for years...
653844,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-06 02:30:00,10439, My bearing buddies have a pressure relief hole that leaks out grease if I over fill my buddies. I don't have any leaks but my wheels are grease covered because of this little hole.
653850,mike rousseau,2012-01-06 02:39:00,4661,  I had a bearing pop before...  Changed the bearing and wiped some of the grease off... Couple years later there was still grease on the rim...  I also have the overflow holes but it should only come out of that hole when filling the bearing buddies...
653851,irishfield,2012-01-06 02:42:00,26272, In truth... it should NEVER come out of that hole.. unless you get careless on the grease gun and why the hole is there to save your
653856,Sinker,2012-01-06 02:45:00,8692,"I inspect my bearings every fall. Never had a problem with them, ever. I repack them if they need it, if not, I just keep on rolling.  Axles are a different story. I have a tendency to break them pretty good  I carry a spare hub with me. If i blow a bearing, I just pull the whole thing off, and put on a whole new one. Takes about 10 mins, and doesn't cost much more than just replacing the bearings/races/seals.  S."
653861,Muskieman,2012-01-06 02:56:00,2472,"Inspect them, grease them... If they're well enough ... Leave them alone.   "
653867,Fisherman,2012-01-06 03:07:00,7201,"Remember stuff breaks down at the most inopportune time, like late Sunday night when you're rolling down the highway, no fix it stores around, you haven't got spare parts with you or tools, etc.  I'm sure you could call the guys above me and then ask for help...or..check now and have peace of mind.  There's some things in the world I trust, older bearing that have not been checked for that many years are not one of them."
653868,ld17,2012-01-06 03:10:00,319,I bought my trailer new and didn't realize that I had to maintain the bearing and learned the hard way when one of the bearings blew apart and the hub was making a bad noise.  I'm lucky it happened close to home.  I now repack my new bearings every spring and put new seals.  I know for sure doing this that I won't have that problem again.  If I were you I would inspect the bearings and put some new seals.  The cost is a few bucks from princess auto.  If everything looks good then your ok.  If not get new ones or repack the old ones if they are good.
653877,rob v,2012-01-06 03:24:00,535,Thanks for the input.   The grease smears on the rims were on the backside so I know it wasn't the over-flow - it had to be the seal.  And yes - they could very well have been replaced before I got the unit.     With the bearing buddies I'm not sure I need to re-pack every year or put in new seals - just keep an eye on the grease level filling them only in accordance with the bearing buddy instruction (fill periodically just till the pressure plate moves).   I've jacked the wheels and there's no play or noise.   The spare hub is a nice idea though - good insurance for longer trips - I may look into that !
653883,scugpg,2012-01-06 03:40:00,1373,I use bearing buddies....but every year also repack or replace the bearings/races and replace seals and I don't trailer a whole lot. Might be overkill but the parts aren't expensive if you shop around. Also keep a hub and parts on hand just in case. The buddies if over filled can blow out seals very easily.  You are in london call the trailer doctor he sells the parts at a very reasonable price just down on exeter
653924,Garnet,2012-01-06 12:05:00,2056,You didn't say how much you trailer or what size trailer.  Princes Auto sells complete hubs with bearings and grease for $35. If they fit your trailer I would buy a set. Then keep your old ones for spares.
653929,lew,2012-01-06 12:24:00,12766," Just for your own peace of mind Rob, why not just replace everything with new and then you'll know for sure that it's all good.  Nothing worse than always having that nagging feeling that something may not be just the way it's sposed to be.  If you can't do it yourself or don't have the space, you could always take it to a reputable shop before the season starts and have it done.  Might cost a few $$$$ but at least you'll know your good for the hiway."
653936,DanD,2012-01-06 13:00:00,2223,Rob.  I’m in London; I have a fully equipped automotive shop and I’m not open to the public on the weekends. I hate doing bearings myself; (funny eh a mechanic that hates getting grease all over his hands) but if you want we can arrange a time and you’re more then welcome to come in and play. If you’ve never done a bearing service or replacement; no worries I’ll supervise; just don't get any grease on me.  Dan.
653937,BITEME,2012-01-06 13:01:00,1968,My opinion if your handy redo them. over time you can wear the fit for a seal and they will leak by its not a big deal they will likely look good when you look at them but once they are spinning at road speed it changes  if you replace the bearings and I say this as a millwright dont buy Chinese bearings still not at the quality level of North America or Europe they are cheaper for a reason bearing buddies and a good water/high pressure grease.With bearing buddies if you notice the plate drop a inch or more a year you likely have seal issues the grease has to go somwhere and it will be out the seal just watch the plate and once a year pop the cap off and make sure that the grease looks good and hasent got alot of water in the spaces in the grease if yes scoop it out put the cap back on and pump it up as long as there is grease in the buddies and nothing impedes the travel of the plunger it will do its job  out of all the jobs you may attempt on a boat this ranks up there on the beginner level.  just my 2 cents Peter
653941,corvette1,2012-01-06 13:13:00,1765,i put new bearings and seals every year its cheap to do. when a trailer is on the side of the road i don't want it to be me
653944,pikehunter,2012-01-06 13:35:00,1659,"Pull them apart, check them out, if something doesn't look right replace them...actually, just replace the bearings and races and keep the old ones after you have repacked them as spares, just in case. Better safe than sorry!!"
653955,smally21,2012-01-06 14:10:00,993,"all great advice. inspect, maintain, repair as necesaary.  im a big fan of replacing the whole assy, its easier, cleaner, faster, less likely to expose the bearing to contaminants, grit, etc.  grease comes out of the bearing when overfilled or overloaded/overheated. grease can cover the rim from a one time occurence without causing catastrophic damage, though it is a warning sign. always best to clean the rim after the first occurence to see if it is happening again.  spares are a great idea, but IMO keeping old parts isn't a sound idea. why did you replace the old parts? if they were fine, why replace them? if there was something wrong with them, why would you reinstall them? bearings start giving you grief if they are marred, have foreign bits in them, have corrosion, etc. how can you guarantee old parts sitting in the bottom of the drawer are in a suitable condition to use? and why would you go to all the hassle and trouble of removing the wheel, hub and bearing assy just to put old parts back in? anyway, my opinion of used parts is quite clear. cutting off your nose in spite or your face or something.  the kind of guy that asks questions about this stuff and keeps an eye on things isn't the kind of guy that gets stranded on the 401. good on ya."
653960,rob v,2012-01-06 14:19:00,535,Thanks for all the opinions.  Sounds like another one of those better safe than sorry questions.   I've got the boat stored in my brother's barn which is about an hour away from anywhere (kind of a pain in the neck) - maybe I'll try and get the job done this winter while its there - just means a couple of trips.  And thanks for the info on the supplier in London - I'll definitely keep that in mind (i assume he carries the good stuff !).  And DanD thanks for the offer - actually if I remember correctly you're the fella that helped me replace my trailer tires last spring !!  thx again - if I don't get it done this winter I may take you up on the offer !!
653963,NBR,2012-01-06 14:22:00,163,When I pull my boat every time I get out of the van I go to the left then right side and touch the hubs. I expect they might be warm but not hot. Hot means you are on your way to failure. Since I've never felt and found a hub hot I don't know what I'd do but I think I'd creep to a repair place or home with the flashers going.
653966,smally21,2012-01-06 14:32:00,993,nothing safer than a slow moving disabled trailer wait -  with the flashers on
653991,bigbuck,2012-01-06 15:54:00,2449,"I'd at least get them apart to take a good look at everything. Mine are at least 3 years old and have had a bit of grease added in the spring each year but this year, I'm taking them apart for a thorough inspection and cleaning. Just because they run cool and don't have any play doesn't mean there isn't a problem coming at some point. Preventative maintenance are the key words here. Bearings don't fail suddenly, it's gradual."
654009,Billy Bob,2012-01-06 16:41:00,5865," Best advice you have so far.......been doing the Jack...Spin....Rock and Roll End Play check for about 17 years now (same bearings) if I remember correctly and I don't even have Bearing Buddies....but if you like to get REAL greasy and dirty and clean and repack the bearings....then go for it....me, I have better things to do in the spring....like cut the friggen grass...LOL"
