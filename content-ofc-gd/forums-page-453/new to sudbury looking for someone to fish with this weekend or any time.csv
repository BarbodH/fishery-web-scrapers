And I'm not much of a fisherman, been doing it since I was 3, but still not that good at it..  I just enjoy getting out there, not too concerned if I bring anything home -for me that's a bonus..."
654142,Nipfisher,2012-01-06 23:06:00,2449,North Bay is only an hour away. Come to Nipissing anytime (you can actually fish Nip's west arm is less than 35 minutes) . Try and join us on the 28th to meet some members at our get together.
654157,Fishnwire,2012-01-06 23:40:00,983,"I won't be doing any fishing until my shack is finished.  How are your carpentry skills?  Seriously though...I'll have you out once it's on the ice.  If you're interested, or just desperately bored, you can come help or just hang out at the build before that.  My work schedule is basically 5 on 4 off 4 on 5 off...so in the summer I go to camp on the off days...if you have (or can get) the time off, I'd bring you there.  The camp is somewhat ""rustic"", so you have to be prepared to rough it a little.  But the fishing is pretty good.  In the early spring between the time you can no longer safely ice fish and before the road into my camp is clear, I'd like to find some places to shore fish for pike or trout, but don't know very many.  If you want to go trying out some spots together, I've got a Jeep and a quad...but no sense of direction.  PM me if you like."
