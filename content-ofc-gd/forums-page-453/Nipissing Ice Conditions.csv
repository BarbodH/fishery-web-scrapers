653408,Rod Caster,2012-01-05 01:14:00,5784,temperature range is 0 to -10 for the next week. Perfect ice fishing weather... at least near shore/sheltered areas where most of the bungalows are. I wouldn't dare travel far on Nipissing yet.  Best of luck guys! I hope the fishing is great on Nipissing this year for everyone.
654920,Homer Is King,2012-01-09 17:03:00,305,"There was lots of ice on south bay.  12"" to 14"" average with a few spots even thicker.  Our operator didn't want us taking our vehicles out but there were lots of full sized trucks out on the bay.  The fishing was great, both quality and quantity!  Our best year yet!  Full report to follow..."
648926,BillM,2011-12-16 16:40:00,17367,I am going to put the hurt to the splake population this winter!   (However tomorrow it will be the steelhead  )
649102,BassAsin,2011-12-17 07:36:00,806,"I was already out on the hard stuff on tuesday, 4"" of solid black, will be back out again tomorrow.  just my guess, is south shore will have 6 inches of ice 2km out from link's beach on jan 1st."
649117,Rod Caster,2011-12-17 13:34:00,5784," I was on 4"" of black last Saturday... But then the rain dropped, so I stayed away. I'm in kirkland at the moment... The lakes are looking better up here.  I'm guessing Bartlett will have some recovery work this year... A lot of anxious ice travellers in North Bay. Be safe."
649228,BassAsin,2011-12-17 22:37:00,806,I'm sure it will be a busy season hauling up vehicles.  was on a small lake again today 3-5 inches of good solid black ice. this cold weather is tightening up the lakes quite well as long as the heavy snow stays off of them for a bit
649269,Nipfisher,2011-12-18 02:47:00,2449,Nippissing Cam    At the bottom of the page click on the beach cam. Nip is frozen a long ways out.
649299,SirWhite,2011-12-18 08:59:00,210,Is the middle of February safe for a truck on the ice?..... For a weekend? Sooo looking forward to trying Nippissing this year!
649301,Terry,2011-12-18 11:27:00,14456," every year every month every week every day every hour  conditions change, so no one can really give you a definitive answer to your question  but if you just want a general answer then I would say yes most years you can this year, still hopeful. but ask again in the middle of Feb. and you will get a better answer  even on the best day I would never just say, yes it is safe for a truck, I might say something like "" in the areas I have fished the last few days, it looked good for a truck but I have not been to all areas of the lake and pressure cracks change hourly"""
649302,Roy,2011-12-18 11:31:00,13728,"Good answer, Terry. There is no such thing as ""safe"" ice. It's one footstep at a time, everyday."
649303,lew,2011-12-18 11:44:00,12766,"And sadly, we're at the time of year when we'll starting reading stories where folks have gone through the ice on their snowmobiles.  People get antsy to be on the ice in the early season and unfortunately too often they head out before the ice is ready."
649305,Roy,2011-12-18 11:58:00,13728," And too often, SAR workers risk their own lives to save people. I know that most folks are prudent but please be careful out there."
649310,Skipper D,2011-12-18 12:32:00,1970,"Hot , Cold , Rain, Sun , Snow , Rain , Ice , no Ice . All of thease can realy turn you around and clowd your judgment in a winter like this one , please remember safty first when your out there ."
649407,paulyboy83,2011-12-18 22:16:00,54,Just got back from the government docks on Nip.  It's frozen as far as I could see out but did not look like safe ice to say the least.  It's going to be a stretch for safe ice for the 1st in my opinion.  Unless we get solid cold days and nights over the next couple of weeks. It's a start and it gives me hope but I wouldn't hold your breath on it happening.
649418,SirWhite,2011-12-18 23:56:00,210,"Understood, thanks Terry."
649496,Nipfisher,2011-12-19 13:06:00,2449,"  My answer would be to see how many vehicles are out where you are going. Although there are some crazies who will venture out on unknown ice, most of the locals understand the ice and will drive out ost of the season.  I drive my 2004 Ford Explorer Sporttrac on the ice as soon as I feel there is safe ice. Usually around 8-10"". Let me know when/where you are fishing I can give you a good idea before you come."
649501,Nipfisher,2011-12-19 14:43:00,2449,+4 today here in North Bay. Not ideal conditions for making ice.
649643,Rod Caster,2011-12-19 23:14:00,5784, it's getting cold again for the next few days... with little snow forecasted this will make shiny black ice!
649651,Freshtrax,2011-12-19 23:40:00,2215,Plenty cold at night from what i have bene reading.
650535,asdve23rveavwa,2011-12-23 14:20:00,2690,"Looking nice and cold up there today, how's the ice doing guys?? Still 23 days of ice making days until my trip."
650545,Homer Is King,2011-12-23 15:24:00,305,Thanks for the updates on the ice conditions!! Keep 'em coming!  I have my annual trip planned with Chilly Willy the first weekend in January. I have my fingers crossed!!
652880,Oryx,2012-01-03 14:52:00,186,"fingers are crossed... Am supposed to be going up on the 8th until the 11th,"
652922,Cosmos,2012-01-03 17:19:00,588,I have a trip booked for Thursday - 5th of January with Idle Times. They just confirmed that we are good to go and stay over night as well.
653359,Homer Is King,2012-01-04 22:52:00,305,"Chilly Willy confirmed with us as well. Cars all packed, heading up tomorrow!!"
653360,Cosmos,2012-01-04 22:55:00,588,"Same here, if you need good minnows - stop by at Jacob's on HWY 11 in Orillia, it's really hard to miss this place. He is open 24/7 - spoke with him today."
653402,OutdoorDan,2012-01-05 00:53:00,325, Is this the place that is about 1km south of Epps?
653405,dheitzner,2012-01-05 01:07:00,314,http://news.ontario.ca/mnr/en/2011/12/province-takes-steps-to-control-spread-of-fish-disease.html  Make sure that you are aware of new baitfish restrictions before you load up with Simcoe shiners...
646463,sneak_e_pete,2011-12-08 15:41:00,540,"Hi all, I have a trip planned to the South Shore of Nipissing with my little boy Jan. 1-4.  Just wondering if anyone can update me on the conditions.  I have been unable to find info. Thanks in advance."
646464,Rod Caster,2011-12-08 15:45:00,5784,"water water everywhere.  14 day forecast has a low of around -11. Not looking good, but don't count it out."
646467,cheaptackle,2011-12-08 16:08:00,849,Hey Chad - those shack repairs involve pontoons at all?
646499,Nipfisher,2011-12-08 18:55:00,2449,"sneak-e-pete check out the Torbay cottages website and view their beach cam. You will see the last 24 hours. http://www.torbay.net/ No ice yet. This past Sunday the marina at the waterfront was iced over with a skim, but that is gone now I believe.   This blurb was taken from the daily blog posted on http://www.greeningbay.com/index.phtml ""Yesterday we had some very light flurries and more overnight but only went down to -4 by the water.  North Bay is claiming -8.  It's too windy to form ice but yesterday morning part of Greening Bay had some.  It's too dark just yet to see but I'm going out on a limb and saying there's a small build up of ice shards along our shoreline this morning. "" If you keep checking these 2 sites you will be kept abreast of the conditions.  Her daily fishing reports are excellent once the season starts.    My guess is it will get realy cold (minus 20s) between the 25th and the 1st. My prediction is I will be fishing on Callander Bay on the 1st. Might not have my shack out but I wuill find some safe ice."
646645,Muskieman,2011-12-09 02:24:00,2472,there was a boat near Jocko Point out today in Snow-Squalls...  Ice free
646659,Bernie,2011-12-09 02:54:00,3190,Heard there was 4 inches of ice on Fish Bay today. Only around the edges in Hunters Bay. Need a calm cold night and the main lake will freeze over.
646842,sneak_e_pete,2011-12-09 18:21:00,540,"Thanks for info.  As always, much appreciated!"
646848,sneak_e_pete,2011-12-09 18:41:00,540,"Sorry, one more question.  I admit I have no idea how ice forms, or how cold it needs to be.  At this point, is there even a chance that the ice will be safe enough to be in an operator's hut on January 1, or should I just re-book?"
646850,Rod Caster,2011-12-09 18:45:00,5784,"Small chance the ice will be ready by jan 1, to be honest. We need at least a week of very cold (-20) temps to get a good sheet. Plus if it keeps snowing, the ice quality will be lower. I'd rebook for the following week or two. After that, if you want to ice fish on nip, give us North Bay members a PM."
646935,Nipfisher,2011-12-09 23:03:00,2449,"  Speak for yourself Chad. I will be fishing on Callander Bay on the 1st. The operator's are cautious about puting their commercial huts out until there is 8-10"" of ice. Call the operator you are booked with and ask how late they will allow you to cancel and re-book. They may be all full for the 1st couple weeks."
646938,Bernie,2011-12-09 23:52:00,3190,I have been boating on the 7th of December and ice fishing at New Years. Once it freezes over it shouldn't take long to tighten up. We do need a good week of cold though. Lots of time yet.
646943,mike rousseau,2011-12-10 00:06:00,4661,On the st.lawrence... You can take your pick of boat or ice... Alot of the river stays open most of the year...  Usually the switch from boat to ice is seamless... 1 week tops...
646952,Rod Caster,2011-12-10 00:42:00,5784," I spoke for myself when I said ""I'd re book""  If I was organizing a trip to Nip from a distance I'd at least have a good contingency plan in place. Like u said keeping in touch with the operator is the best thing to do."
647963,Rod Caster,2011-12-13 14:36:00,5784,http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/caon0484  Jan 1st is NOT looking good
647979,Big Cliff,2011-12-13 15:31:00,6899,"last couple of years we were ice fishing here on Sturgeon lake on New Years day. The long range forecast is calling for above normal temperatures for the next two weeks, + 10 for tomorrow and nights not getting nearly as cold as normal. I very much doubt we'll be ice fishing out here by the first. There is a bit of ice shards in the bay infront of our place but it isn't solid enough to walk on. Good luck with your Nip Trip!"
648030,Nipfisher,2011-12-13 18:29:00,2449,DEFINATELY won't be huts out for the 1st. I still plan on fishing Callander Bay but will be on foot. +7 or +8 (depends on what website you look at) forecasted for Thurs.  North Bay Forecast
648229,BassAsin,2011-12-14 05:24:00,806,"Nip is still open, was down at fish bay today and it was a light drizzle with ice maybe 50yds out only a couple inches. small lakes were froze enough for me to get out on monday on 4 inches of solid black, but todays plus 3 and drizzly conditions may have done them in too."
648232,ctdd2006,2011-12-14 06:29:00,531,I don't think we'll be out for trout opener here in Elliot Lake unless it is a smell speck lake.  We're wide open and have yet to see an inch of snow.
648340,Bassaholic,2011-12-14 17:40:00,74,"In the same boat as Pete, looking to spend a weekend on Nip with some buddies but dont really know when to book with all this warm weather we're having. Whats the latest you local guys have seen the operators get their huts out for the season? We're thinking about going Jan.13th..."
648353,Nipfisher,2011-12-14 18:33:00,2449,"One year, about 15 years ago, we couldn't fish until Feb. 4th! Not sure if or when the bungalows got out then (or if there were even bungalows then)."
648802,bassnass,2011-12-16 01:44:00,174,Word from Rob Hyatt is that his huts will NOT be out for the 1st.  (My trip is bumped a week!)
648913,Big Cliff,2011-12-16 16:01:00,6899,"Well, there isn't a spec of ice here on Sturgeon Lake today, that rain and + 10 yesterday did  in what little there was. Long range forecast still calling for above normal temps for the next two weeks. Looks like this is going to be a short season for ice fishing!"
648915,Nipfisher,2011-12-16 16:07:00,2449, Today    Sat    Sun    Mon    Tue   
648918,Rod Caster,2011-12-16 16:14:00,5784,
648924,asdve23rveavwa,2011-12-16 16:33:00,2690, Nice!  As long as Callander is froze over on January 15th...I'm a happy camper!
