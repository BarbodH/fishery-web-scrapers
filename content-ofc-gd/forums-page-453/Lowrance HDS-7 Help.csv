652415,captpierre,2012-01-01 17:18:00,2521,Had the same problem last spring. Radioworld said they put it on tight so it doesn't fly off when you drive fast. Push in the centre with both thumbs and pull the edges with your fingers. Works best when mounted.  It will be easier subsequently Hope that helps.

There are two wires that split, and the manual says one is a data cable and one is a power cable.  The power cable has a red, black, and yellow wire.  Do I just need to set up the red and black wires to connect to the battery?  What is the yellow wire for (a ground wire?), and what is the data cable for?"
654252,irishfield,2012-01-07 03:45:00,26272,  Read.. read and read the manual again! Once you let the magic smoke out it doesn't work anymore!!  (I suspect all you need is red to + and black to - !)
654283,scugpg,2012-01-07 12:05:00,1373,Data cable is for networking tape those wires off separately.  Red and black are for power the yellow is a trigger wire if you are powering up accessories only if your hds is on. Tape it off too.
