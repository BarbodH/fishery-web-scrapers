654839,Nipfisher,2012-01-09 14:19:00,2449,"I have a Stowaway Marine/RV deep cycle battery (model ST31DC205) from my trailer that I want to use in my ice hut for my 12v lights and tunes. For Christmas I recieved a MotoMaster Intelligent battery charger.  It asks me to input the CCA for optimal charging but the battery only indicates reserve time 205 minutes and 115 Amp hours. I used the battery last year with my old, not intelligent, battery chrager and it worked great.   Yesterday I took the battery to the hut and the lights didn't last 30 minutes?????? I had charged it to FULL at 500 CCA as a guess.....but I guess that wasn't enough???     Any ideas?"
654844,Dabluz,2012-01-09 14:25:00,701," Motomaster Intelligent battery chargers do not recharge deep cycle batteries.  If you still have your charger's manual, you will read that somewhere in the manual but not easy to find.  I went to Walmart and bought a Schumacher intelligent charger and it works fine."
654847,bigbuck,2012-01-09 14:36:00,2449,Try your old charger on it. Sometimes the newfangled 'intelligent' chargers don't get a deep cycle fully charged. Your battery could also be on it's way out. How old is it?? One of the problems with the power convertor/chargers on trailers is that the charger can overcharge the battery.
654856,Roy,2012-01-09 14:55:00,13728,FYI the CCA on that battery is 725.
654857,Nipfisher,2012-01-09 14:59:00,2449,"  1st page inside cover says "" This battery charger can be used with conventional and maintenance-free automotive batteries, marine deep-cycle batteries, and AGM gell-cell batteries..............   I have now tried charging it with REMNANT TIME charging which is the default setting.    If this doesn't work I'll try the old charger and test the battery."
654859,Nipfisher,2012-01-09 15:00:00,2449, Thank you sir. That is the answer I was looking for.
