654962,TroutnMuskieHunter,2012-01-09 19:52:00,1362,Wow...some really nice Pike there Dave!!...I'm jealous too!
654707,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-09 00:07:00,10439,"Wow!!! What a day!!! Awesome warm temps and light tropical breezes and super fast action!!!! I left the house at first light and was set up and fishing about an hour later. Before I could get my jigging line set up I had my first hit on my tip up. After resetting I headed into the hut to continue with my jig stick, I didn't get to far, FLAG!!! I ran back to my tip up second fish. As I was dropping my bait back down I hit another, and another......... It was 45 minutes from the time I dropped my first line before I managed to get my second line in the water. After 3 hours I had iced 20 pike and lossed/missed a bunch more!!! I ended up with about 1/2 dozen over 30"" with one over 40"". I was fishing solo again today and man that was a lot of work!!! I think I need a rum now.  Here's a few pics of the better ones.      "

654719,WeedLine,2012-01-09 00:34:00,322,Your hands must be shredded. Great report and pics
654721,Fishnwire,2012-01-09 00:39:00,983,That's insane.  Getting just one fish like that would be a good day for most guys.  A couple like that in a day might be my best day all season.  That's a heckava resource you've got up there...but it seems like you know what you're doing too.  Thanks for the report.
654723,Jet,2012-01-09 00:43:00,364,Awesome Dave!!!! Since we're practically neighbors I should head up that way!!  Gotta love the early ice we both get.
654726,solopaddler,2012-01-09 00:48:00,8605,Sounds like a lot of fun buddy and a perfect cardio workout to boot.  Now let's see some big lakers!
654730,lhousesoccer,2012-01-09 01:00:00,442,"Man, I would love to fish NWT!  That's awesome."

654736,mercman,2012-01-09 01:23:00,7054,Awesome fishin Dave !!! Keep em comin'
654738,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-09 01:27:00,10439," That's next on the list Mike.    Yeah Roy, I wouldn't want all you Southerners invading my fishin' spots would I."
654755,Big Cliff,2012-01-09 02:14:00,6899,"  Actually he did Roy, he was really fishing out in front of the CN Tower.  Nice work Dave that sounds like a day of fishing any of us ""Southeners"" would love to have!"
654764,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-09 02:47:00,10439,"  Yep, I was fishin' Toronto Island can't you tell?"

654806,fishindevil,2012-01-09 11:25:00,6254,awesome winter pike dave !!!
654866,johnnyb,2012-01-09 15:14:00,3413,"I love these reports man....keep'em coming!  Are you waiting for safe ice for lakers, or for the season to open?  Cuz I'd like to see summa those too, please"
654908,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-09 16:43:00,10439,  Neither. Wanted to get the pike fishing done and am waiting for the days to get a little longer as it's a further hike to the laker spots. There are no seasons here to speak of. The road system laker spots are C&R in September and October and a 1 fish limit the rest of the year. All other spots are open year round with different retention limits for Great Slave compared to the rest of the Territory.
654923,jedimaster,2012-01-09 17:04:00,3472,amature...you gotta know when you drill your jigging hole closer to your tip up hole.  NICE fish..
