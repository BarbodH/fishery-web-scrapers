He looked at her for a while...then said, ""You're A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K.""    She asks..... ""What does that mean?""    He said, ""Adorable, Beautiful, Cute, Delightful, Elegant, Foxy, Gorgeous, Hot.    She smiled happily and said.. ""Oh, that's so lovely.. What about I, J, K?""    He said, ""I'm Just Kidding!""    The swelling in his eye is going down and the doctor is fairly optimistic about saving his testicles"
