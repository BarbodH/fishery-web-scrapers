654264,BillM,2012-01-07 05:02:00,17367,"I remember that pic from last year, someone said it was taken around Tbay?"
654294,Billy Bob,2012-01-07 13:37:00,5865,"No antlers and herding indicates to me that this is late winter, probably March depending how far up north this was taken."
654295,lew,2012-01-07 13:42:00,12766," When do the deer lose their antlers Bob ?? I had a buck in the back yard a few days back and my wife asked me when, but I have no idea"
654298,Roy,2012-01-07 14:06:00,13728,What I'd like to know is what the dude is spraying on his sled track. Probably WD-40 eh?  I hear it has apple cider in it.
654314,richyb,2012-01-07 15:28:00,774, Some will drop their antlers as early as mid to late december and otheres I have seen in april still with them on. Im not positive but I think its the hormone levels that trigger it.
654316,lew,2012-01-07 15:45:00,12766," Thanks Rich, I was never sure about that."
654317,Billy Bob,2012-01-07 15:48:00,5865," Lew,  Usually not long after I squeeze the trigger....  richb has the non-smartass answer....it can vary."
654318,Billy Bob,2012-01-07 15:50:00,5865," MUST be, because if it was as rumoured fish oil, there would salmon swimming up that hill...."
654345,tb4me,2012-01-07 18:27:00,3295,That looks like the North Humberland forest. I trail ride up that hill quite often in the summer on my dual sport..
