651813,coreyhkh,2011-12-30 04:11:00,163,I live in gravenhurst and gull lake is not even frozen there is ice around the edges but it's going to be two weeks of cold temps before I would even dare go out there.
651814,FishAbout,2011-12-30 04:12:00,106,"No ice yet on the big lakes up here.  Going to be a while untill we have good ice on the big lakes.  Big fisher it says your from bracebridge, do you not drive around and look at the lakes yourself?"
