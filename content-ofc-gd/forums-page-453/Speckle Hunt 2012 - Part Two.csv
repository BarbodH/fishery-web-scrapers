654443,Leecher,2012-01-07 23:31:00,7832,"After last Monday's weather fiasco, only to find the lake covered in slush, not even fishing and long drive round trip... I couldn't wait / pump to get back there knowing that the past freezing temps had harden the slush and increase the ice thickness  Well to my surprise, ice was a good 9"" now (6"" of black and 3"" of white)   A little bit of details... When I left home, temp was -7C, heavy overcast and no wind... perfect    Arriving at destination, temp was -3C     Was looking to be a mild session... Sun did came out    Got a nice a little tan    Went 10 for 14    Missed a great looking beauty at the hole    and got my limit, WHOO HOO    When I left, temp was +3C  Did not take many pics except for these sorry   Wish I could taken some of the amigos... they certainly had a good time too   But the most important thing for me today was, it was my dad's birthday... he would of been 80 and dedicate this outing to him    He would of been real proud of me  Hope you enjoy Tight lines Leechman  Time of departure... Sorry for the poor quality    Another female not able to hold her roe    Group hug  "

654471,misfish,2012-01-08 01:28:00,29133,Nice fish guys      AWESOME
654488,Live2fish85,2012-01-08 02:26:00,1633,Another awesome report Jacques. You guys have a awesome spot there for fishing. Can't wait to see the next report.  Thanks for sharing.
654497,BassAsin,2012-01-08 02:49:00,806,"good work Jaques, waking up to the bear i see.     some nice coloured fish too."
654512,Leecher,2012-01-08 03:54:00,7832," Thanks Grimace!!!   Thanks Paul!!! I didn't notice but heard a lot of commotion coming out of the mountain behind me throughout my stay   Thanks WeedLine!!!   Thanks Chad!!!  Yeah a few of them do   Kev, it was awesome to share the hard surface with you today I'd been talking to my dad even before I arrived and think he did help me a lot at achieving this goal    He was my mentor when it comes to fishing    Sorry I didn't share the next lake you guys targeted but this was something I had to do by myself   Thanks Joey!!!   I knew you'd find some way to manage   Thanks Brian!!!   Thanks Chris!!!  I'm going back   for sure... next weekend   Thanks Matt!!!  Yeah The Bear is always on when driving up there"
654516,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-08 04:24:00,2690,"Way to go Jacques!!  You are having one heck of an ice season so far! One week until we hit the road for some ice, FINALLY!!!"
654522,corvette1,2012-01-08 05:14:00,1765,congrats leech awesome day
654531,wormdunker,2012-01-08 06:49:00,1711,Nice pix.  Thanx for sharing.  I have never fished specs thru the ice.  Looks awesome!  I suppose u have to go back to that same lake HA HA
654553,solopaddler,2012-01-08 13:23:00,8605,"Awesome Jacques!  So how are you guys catching these little stockers? In tight to shore in front of beaver dams, etc, in deeper water off points, are you jigging for them? What? Spill the beans, inquiring minds want to know."
654558,Leecher,2012-01-08 14:26:00,7832," Thanks Frankie!!!  I sure do    Hope it continues    Good luck next week!!!   Thanks Corvy!!!  You bet   Thanks wormdunker!!!  They are fun to catch and finicky sometimes... changing up presentations is key   Thanks Mike!!!  I was about 30' from shore, in 8' to 10' fow, no structure in sight, sand bottom, dead sticking salties with this setup... salties did the most damage, I caught 8    It has a quick strike aluminum indicator at the end that retracts    I tied my own lead (12Lbs mono ice type) and used the smallest hooks (Mustad Octopus / Beak, Ultrapoint size 4) I could find    This week, they were finicky compared to last and didn't want their food going up and down    Also they seemed to be attracted to chartreuse... last time it was white.  Caught a couple on a 1/4oz jig, dressed with power grub tipped with 1"" Gulp minnow and not jigging, the rod was sitting in it's holder when the strike occurred."
654560,limeyangler,2012-01-08 14:38:00,5204,Awesome report....AGAIN!  Real nice to get a great day out to dedicate to your pops Jacques....good job.   I think i am gonna move there....i cant buy a fish here it seems!
654570,Leecher,2012-01-08 15:22:00,7832, Thanks Simon!!!  He was on my mind all day long  Keep at it... some are bound to come out to play sooner or later   Just a matter of time I suppose
654578,solopaddler,2012-01-08 15:54:00,8605,That's about as simple and as basic a set up as you'll ever see. Obviously it works!  You guys ever tempted to sneak a little baggy of live minnows in with you?  That's gotta be one of the dumbest angling laws ever.
654582,danc,2012-01-08 15:59:00,4677,Fantastic report Jacques. Brings back memories for me when I use to do the same thing. Keep the reports coming.
654598,fishnsled,2012-01-08 16:29:00,3520,A great day on the ice!!  Thanks for the report.
654601,wee scot,2012-01-08 16:43:00,75,"Nice fish jaques were they all stocked fish ?.Solo paddler i,m guessing was joking about the live minnows (i hope)looks like u guys do well enough without them ,well played"
654617,Leecher,2012-01-08 18:44:00,7832," Simple and effective for sure Mike   I have 2 of those rods for dead sticking... they're roughly 20 years old   don't think they make them anymore... haven't seen any in stores.  I'm sure the rod builders on this site could make one very easily.  Another product that I think I'll throw in the arsenal is Gulp paste in pink...  Chartreuse, white and pink are the most productive colors for specks... ya just can't go wrong with them   Just got to figure out which one they want  As for the minnows, never cross my mind... that law been in place for such a long time now.  It's even against the law to drive on that road with live minnows in your car... if caught, get a fine   Only other alternative is leeches and dew worms or salties   Thanks Dan!!!  I'll do my best   Thanks Will!!!  You bet   Thanks wee scot!!!  They are all stock.  Usually that lake is closed for hard water... sure glad it's open this year    There's not many around that are open up here."
