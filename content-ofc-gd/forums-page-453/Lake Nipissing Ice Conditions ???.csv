654571,juventus77,2012-01-08 15:26:00,8,Hey There Everyone  I am just wondering how the ice is on Lake Nipissing. I booked Smittys for the first weekend in Febuary. Just very curious how the ice conditions are in that area. Im starting to get worried with all the mild temps we are getting here in Hamilton. Has Anyone been to Smittys??? Any feedback or comments would be greatly appriciated.  Thanks in advance and be safe
