650580,DOS,2011-12-23 19:13:00,119,"Well, I just drove past the resevoir in Orangeville and it seems like we made a bit of ice last night.  Looks to be frozen across,  man am I getting the itch, c'mon -10c weather.  Got to make the ice thick now...    RED"
650586,_Ra_,2011-12-23 20:03:00,16,planning on going there for my first time ice fishing
650599,adempsey,2011-12-23 21:05:00,1498, I think it's a good lake to try out ice fishing.  You can rent ice huts there as well.   Went a few years back and caught some pike.  Saw other people catch oos Bass.
651604,BucktownAngler,2011-12-29 15:01:00,582,"Had 2 good cold nights, hoping to get on there soon"
651611,uglyfish,2011-12-29 15:53:00,981,Keep us updated on ice conditions please! Would love to try some fishing there!
651782,Rattletrap2,2011-12-30 02:31:00,1652,"Hey, I drive by it almost every day! I think we might have the makings of a get together out there this winter! LOL It is one of my favourite places to ice fish. I usually do okay there and it is 10 minutes from home!"

651877,lookinforwalleye,2011-12-30 15:31:00,4399,  We should hook up one day Brian!
651878,Raf,2011-12-30 15:35:00,3495,i too am about 15 mins from there (just moved).  kinda overlooked it in the past but it might be a place to go being that close.
651881,DOS,2011-12-30 15:44:00,119," Its a great little fishery,  mostly hammer handle pike but if you can find them, the crappie fishing can be exceptional.  Mostly very shallow so the preferred method is to tip up or dead stick for the pike and ya got to be quiet.  I have watched the pike sit with their nose at my bait for 5 mins before striking but if you tap your foot or someone walks by, they take off like a rocket...  Will let ya know when it opens    RED"
652995,BucktownAngler,2012-01-03 21:57:00,582,"i called the hotline, they expect to open on Saturday, but no hut rentals will be available as of yet.  minnows might not be available saturday either"
