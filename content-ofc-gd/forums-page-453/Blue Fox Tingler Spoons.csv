654602,GBW,2012-01-08 16:43:00,8460,"being lazy and not wanting to google it, got a pick or a link so I can see it?  *edit to add* these?   Ok, not so lazy I guess...  lol"
654605,Eazy,2012-01-08 16:51:00,260,
654613,Rod Caster,2012-01-08 17:44:00,5784,I've got a couple. They work ok for perch and walleye.
654614,kickingfrog,2012-01-08 17:48:00,8333,I use 'em. They are my brother's goto spoon. He really likes the glow.
654788,archie_james_c,2012-01-09 04:36:00,618,"They look pretty in my tackle box, thats about it."
654797,wormdunker,2012-01-09 09:50:00,1711,They look awesome.  Thanx for the pix.  I'm going to search them out here in Sudbury.
654868,johnnyb,2012-01-09 15:16:00,3413,I like'em....nice fluttering action.  The wife came up with a handy technique that works well in shallow water....she swings them side to side....just pulls the line from one side of the hole to the other....whatever it does to the spoon seems to get the fish on it pretty quick
654884,Eazy,2012-01-09 15:58:00,260," Yet another fisherman that has been caught by the glimmer of some new fangled piece of tackle!  Don't worry, happens to me quite too often!"
654975,archie_james_c,2012-01-09 20:33:00,618,  Ive seen your wall of spoons and crankbaits. To say you have a problem is an understatement
654978,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-09 20:36:00,0,i've always thought it would be a great ice fishing lure but i've never had much luck with it.  similar concepts in different shapes always seem to work better for me.  i even bought several colours because they were cheap at CT.
655144,Eazy,2012-01-10 03:36:00,260,"Ah, precisely......but every so often you hit the one that's a real winner!"
