654172,BillM,2012-01-07 00:13:00,17367,I'd like some close up pics of that bracket.  Very cool idea.
654177,mike rousseau,2012-01-07 00:18:00,4661,Ht has one like that at canadian tire...  But the ht version has a base...
654180,Fishing 24/7,2012-01-07 00:21:00,709,how much do they cost?
654198,mike rousseau,2012-01-07 00:51:00,4661,Not sure the price...  But here's a pic...  Now that I've seen it set up it looks kinda tippy...    
654200,Joeytier,2012-01-07 00:53:00,3990,Isn't that the point of a tip-up?
654206,mike rousseau,2012-01-07 01:01:00,4661,  I mean that the hole apparatus would fall over...
654210,BillM,2012-01-07 01:16:00,17367,"All you need is a decent base, it wouldn't go anywhere...  I think I might run something like that for whities this year..  I'll have to get the oldman to whip something up in the workshop."
654244,Fishing 24/7,2012-01-07 03:05:00,709,  NOW your talking! i mean it took me about an houre to make five!  WOW the one from ct takes WAY to much space man when i walk 30 minutes on a lake i like to travel light and that bracket seems WAY to complicated for nothing.
654254,BillM,2012-01-07 03:49:00,17367,You could even use an elastic band with some weights on the end to really make it balanced.
654271,OutdoorDan,2012-01-07 06:47:00,325, I think if you mixed some snow/slush over it and packed it it would be okay.
654408,Fishing 24/7,2012-01-07 22:17:00,709,  i just add more sleeves but seriously... when you set your drag to nothing. the fish can run with the line freely!
