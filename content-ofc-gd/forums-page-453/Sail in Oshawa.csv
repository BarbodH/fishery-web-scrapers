654587,ranksda58,2012-01-08 16:06:00,69,"sucks to hear that...gotta love retail jobs though, my wife went from 30 hours before christmas to 4 hours after christmas"
654590,Billy Bob,2012-01-08 16:13:00,5865," All retail stores do it......hire at least 2X the amount that they normally need to set up the store and make a good impression on the public....then cherry pick the employees they want to keep. That's business.....everyone here would do the same thing if they owned the store.  Stoty, SORRY it didn't work out for you...hopefully it's only a bump in the  road to a bigger and better career."
654595,fishnsled,2012-01-08 16:24:00,3520,Tough break Stoty.  You'll bounce back but it sure sucks.  Bigger and better things await.
654596,Big Cliff,2012-01-08 16:24:00,6899,"For every door that closes, another one opens. You have been through this before and you always seem to bounce back. Just use this as an opportunity to move on to bigger and better things.  Good luck in your new venture or career path what ever it might be!"
654635,esoxansteel,2012-01-08 19:31:00,1307,"With any tackle store, if they have what im lookin for, I will buy it, if they dont I will take my business elsewhere, I do not travel from store to store burning up gas trying to save a buck, With the Sail store it gives me another option, their fly fishing department is pretty darn good by the way."
654720,Dutch,2012-01-09 00:39:00,831,"Sorry to hear Stoty.  I was in at Sail today for the first time, I liked it and so did my wife surprisingly.  I only picked up a pack of Trokar hooks ($8 vs. $12 at BPS), I would probably go again when I am in the neighbourhood.  The customer service seemed reasonable, I was asked by at least 2 people in the fishing section and one in hunting if they could help me out.  Much better than most other places.  Opportunity for you Stoty, good luck with your search."
654731,bucktail,2012-01-09 01:05:00,1857,"Sorry man that bites! Hopefully its one of those ""one door closes and another opens"" Your a sharp dude I have full confidence in you !!!!!"
654733,bucktail,2012-01-09 01:07:00,1857,"Wow didnt read Cliffs comment, now I feel so dumb. But it I still stick with what I said , full confidence youll do good buddy.   Darren"
654742,Oggie,2012-01-09 01:42:00,588,And they wonder why nobody chooses a career in retail. Poor pay and zero job security. I always laugh when  i hear store managers complain about tthe quality of the employees they get. You pay crap wages and you treat employees poorly.
654762,Stoty,2012-01-09 02:46:00,2910,Just sucks because of the time of year and I put a lot of hard work in helping to open that store.
654852,bigbuck,2012-01-09 14:46:00,2449,"That is the way  the game is played. Hire a lot more staff than you need, keep them on for a couple of months and then pare back. Hopefully the next job for you works out and good luck."
654914,Mike Pike,2012-01-09 16:57:00,1332," Nope, just a private business with no conscience."
654917,Billy Bob,2012-01-09 16:59:00,5865,Or a private business that has to answer to stockholders.....
654919,bigugli,2012-01-09 17:01:00,6138,"First, and primary, rule of business   "" Keep it in the black""."
654924,Mike Pike,2012-01-09 17:13:00,1332,"Lots of ways to answer shareholders, but the one that's always taken is to cut staff."
654925,Billy Bob,2012-01-09 17:17:00,5865," OK....let's play that game...I'm a share holder and your running the store but it's now losing money....how do you keep it a float so I don't lose my entire investment and you lose your job....I know it wouldn't be, ""we need to hire more help""....so what else can you do ? ? ?.....money running short and the clock is ticking.....monthly rent payments are do and MANY distributors want to be paid NOW..."
654927,Mike Pike,2012-01-09 17:27:00,1332,I ask who the boob was who got us into this terrible money loosing mess and I'd start with them!  That person probably makes as much as the collective of the people he just fired.
654928,Billy Bob,2012-01-09 17:30:00,5865,LOL
654929,adempsey,2012-01-09 17:35:00,1498,"It's unfortunate, but I am sure it was their plan from the start.  Glad to see you already have an interview.  Good luck!"
654930,Headhunter,2012-01-09 17:49:00,5703,"How many of us go into a bricks and motar store to check something out, only to go home and order it on-line for a small % of savings? In all honesty, I don't think that we consumers have anyone to blame, but ourselves for many of our purchasing wows... Stoty, your a bright guy, who certainly doesn't lack ambition.... you'll be fine. HH"
654988,jpfishing,2012-01-09 21:08:00,53,I hear that support your local priv shops around the oshawa area. Goodluck with finding a new job
654995,jedimaster,2012-01-09 21:28:00,3472,Thats typical for every retail store on start up. Unfortunate but thats the name of the game.
655091,pics,2012-01-10 00:54:00,1268,Home Depot does the same thing when they open a new store. Lots of happy staff to start up but within the year the stores' management has to start to show some growth in profits. It comes down to who made the best impression with the boss which does not mean they're keeping the best employees!! I'm surprised how harsh some people can be ....lol
654472,Stoty,2012-01-08 01:31:00,2910,Was just laid off.... def sucks this time of year.
654473,Terry,2012-01-08 01:33:00,14456,that does suck  sorry to hear that
654474,crappieperchhunter,2012-01-08 01:38:00,2582,"It as become an all to familiar business practice...that for some reason is ""acceptable"" in todays world.  Sorry to hear the news."
654475,MCTFisher9120,2012-01-08 01:43:00,3761,"Sorry to hear bud, it was a lot of people...head it's been pretty slow over there too lately..."
654477,BillM,2012-01-08 01:43:00,17367,Welcome to retail...  That's not uncommon at all.
654478,Joeytier,2012-01-08 01:43:00,3990,"They opened right before Christmas...most big retail stores hire on extra staff for the holiday season.  It's unfortunate, but certainly not surprising?"
654479,danbouck,2012-01-08 01:47:00,4380,"That's what happens, we had a guy quit before Christmas and surprise surprise is looking for his job back"
654480,irishfield,2012-01-08 01:48:00,26272,Back to guiding....  you all started together and only some let go.. read something into that and learn from it!
654481,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-08 01:54:00,10439,"  Yep, my guess is the brown nosing   kissers are the ones still working there."
654482,Harrison,2012-01-08 01:56:00,2202,"There may be another shop coming to a town near you soon, actually really near, we'll talk."
654484,Stoty,2012-01-08 02:00:00,2910,"Sweet, sounds good!"
654487,workwear,2012-01-08 02:05:00,592,you mean 'SAIL' isnt a goverment entity which hires ppl for life???...wow imagine that..
654489,bigugli,2012-01-08 02:27:00,6138,"Regular part of the retail game.  Open new store, hire army of prospectives to get store ready. After the opening ( or after Xmas ) drop the surplus."
654491,uglyfish,2012-01-08 02:35:00,981,"well, if th store is anything like the website... it would be no shock if the business sucks and they're not making enough money to keep all the staff on."
654496,Stoty,2012-01-08 02:46:00,2910,Apparently they're working on a whole new website.
654498,solopaddler,2012-01-08 02:50:00,8605,"Some of you guys are pretty harsh.  Sorry to hear, I'm sure you'll bounce back."
654500,Stoty,2012-01-08 02:57:00,2910,Thanks Solo
654517,uglyfish,2012-01-08 04:31:00,981, i feel for ya bud. good luck and hope things work out. my brother just got laid off dec. 23 and he worked with me. kinda that time of year.
654535,wormdunker,2012-01-08 07:07:00,1711,"Sorry to hear of your luck.  I was in another big box store (won't use the name) over Xmas & i can say that their prices R not always the best.  I have been able to get good deals in alot of our smaller tackle shops.  I prefer places like Fishing World, Grimsby Tackle, Erie tracker for their friendly, helpful service.  No I don't work for them!  HA HA"
654554,Rizzo,2012-01-08 13:43:00,4754, hey in this day and age if that's what it takes I'd say pucker-up
654562,Radnine,2012-01-08 14:43:00,1538,"Having a job in retail is a bit like having a job in the manufacturing sector: Out of date and continually on the verge of being temporary. I recently had a pair of Clarke's Desert Boots shipped to my house for $100, ALL IN!(from Eddie Bauer). The cheapest I found them at the mall was $120 (before taxes, before driving 15 minutes to and from the mall etc.). Ask yourself how many times you have got great deals internet shopping and you begin to see the fate of bricks-and-mortar stores. There will always be some, but I don't think that there is room for redundancy like there used to be. I feel bad for you Stotty because I know that you are a good man, and you no doubt put an effort into your work for them. But I think that you are a victim of our times and the lesson here is that one needs to look at any job and be aware of how fleeting they can be. Even in teaching I am starting to believe that I may not see full time employment until my retirement (about 15 years to go). Best of luck to you. Jim"
654569,limeyangler,2012-01-08 15:21:00,5204, I was thinking the same thing as i was reading down the post...your post was the point that i decided to add my 2cents....like solo said Stoty...tough break.
654573,Sinker,2012-01-08 15:36:00,8692,maybe they just kept the good workers and let the rif raf go?
654580,Joeytier,2012-01-08 15:55:00,3990,"I actually applied there on a whim, and later turned down an interview from them.  I certainly don't regret it."
654581,GBW,2012-01-08 15:58:00,8460,I have yet to go there so maybe that's why?  just saying...  sorry to hear you're looking for work again.
