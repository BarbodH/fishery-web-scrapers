654759,peter23,2012-01-09 02:30:00,95,"believe it or not i have never used the bad boyz in lake simcoe yet. ive always used williams, jigging raps etc. this year im going to start using them for whities on simcoe and just need help on colour choice. i have the black and silver minnow colour and the black and dark green. is there any colours that our your favourite for simcoe? ive heard that a chartreuse crappie tube is best to tip it with. any help on colours for the bad boyz? thanks!"
654805,misfish,2012-01-09 10:56:00,29133,"I find the Meegs, tipped with a green tube works much better."
654819,Woodsman,2012-01-09 13:10:00,1286,White mini tubes work for me. What's better for me though is a small shiner hooked through the mouth & out the top of the head.
654871,peter23,2012-01-09 15:25:00,95,thanks!
654886,Eazy,2012-01-09 16:01:00,260,"Seem to be alot of varients of this type of bait on the market now, I think that 'Lil' foxee one with the feather hackle looks pretty sweet!"
654887,Terry,2012-01-09 16:04:00,14456,I have had the best luck with the meegs and the same tube as Misfish  I only use them when fish are not biting if fish are active I like the williams ice jig
654892,richyb,2012-01-09 16:09:00,774,"  Im the same way Terry. I get bored too easily just diddling that damn thing down there. Id rather be jigging away the day but when im marking them and not catching ill put down a bad boys and it does the trick. I like the chart belly, green back with tiger strips with a green tube on the back."
654933,Woodsman,2012-01-09 17:54:00,1286,Terry i was nearby when you caught that laker that won the Fishing for Tyler event a few years back on a meegs. The hut flew open quite fast & you were quite excited. I can't blame you either.
654934,Terry,2012-01-09 17:57:00,14456,LOL  I knew I had the winning fish on perch rod ..4 lb test...... it had all but spooled me 3 times  you bet I was excited.....LOL  and it was a meegs
654944,Woodsman,2012-01-09 18:34:00,1286,I`m sure anyone remotely close knew that. Hell they may of even heard you in Beaverton.
654951,misfish,2012-01-09 19:15:00,29133," Given the amount of fish terry catch,he gets that way with all his catches."
654952,Terry,2012-01-09 19:20:00,14456,oh  that hurts    a tear runs down my cheek
