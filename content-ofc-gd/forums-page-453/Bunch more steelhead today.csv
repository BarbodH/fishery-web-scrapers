654539,BCLT,2012-01-08 08:20:00,86,"im new to this myself fishing bronte for salmon and etc - I primarily got on the pin for commons and have landed fish over 30 pounds on korean floats 18 inches long with single kernals of korn! - so after being told many times ""your wasting your money pinning for commons, I hit up bronte with the pin and a 10.5 light action steelie rod, and nailed 5 chinies up to 35 pounds!  my questions are - 1) I thought in our zone steelies, bows etc are out of season with the exception of the mouths of tribs? 2) Are you guys who are landing these chromies, risking it by tredding out for these fish or is there something im missing 3) It seems that the locals are hitting the piers and floating single eggs, yet Im seeing pics of fish being landed in tribs, regardless of tribs in Ontario apperantly out of season........please explain  Im new to this, Im not asking for hot spots, just an explanation on how things work, if your worried about public posts, please pm to explain how this works........ as I know nothing, and am not about to LURK, I know spots myself, but just dont know if I can fish them  shawn"
654551,solopaddler,2012-01-08 13:14:00,8605,"  Shawn it seems to me you're using the centrepin for its intended application anyway.  It's an age old style of fishing developed in Britain where I doubt there are many steelhead swimming.  As far as your other questions, check the reg's.  Here in ON there are many rivers that have subtantial portions of them open year round.  If you have a passport and cross the border all of the rivers are open for steelhead year round."
654120,icefisherman,2012-01-06 22:17:00,952,"Well since ice is absent and weather is nice what better to do today than go check how the steelies are doing....and they sure were ready to play....6/9 today my best day so far since I started this new to me type of fishing a month or so ago...lots of bites and all were nice clean fresh silver fish....I know they are not whitefish from Lake Simcoe but for now it'll have to do....few shots bellow for your viewing pleasure....lots of power and energy in those fish few good acrobats did 7-8 jumps each...fun fun and more fun ...ha ha ha My first day fighting with icebergs and shore ice...definately trickier and more challenging than without but doable. One fish had a nasty and fresh lamprey wound on its side .....            Cheers,  Ice Fisherman"
654123,Joeytier,2012-01-06 22:33:00,3990,"Yeah, they don't look or fight anywhere near as nice as a whitefish eh?  Good fishin"
654130,Djeep,2012-01-06 22:43:00,199,"beauties, makes me wanna get out there for another shot at one while the weather's still decent."
654139,kingofthesteelhead,2012-01-06 23:01:00,140,would take steelhead over whitefish any day.the way winter is going you may see a lot more of these!
654179,Leecher,2012-01-07 00:20:00,7832,Awesome Emil   You're a natural Mind as well keep going after chrome... got them dialed in
654181,Rod Caster,2012-01-07 00:22:00,5784,a month ago I was suprised you guys were still fishing the rivers... at this point its unbelievable. Have you ever seen it this late before?
654184,Joeytier,2012-01-07 00:28:00,3990,"It only takes a day of mild weather/rain to open up the tribs, and there's plenty warm days all winter."
654189,solopaddler,2012-01-07 00:36:00,8605,"  Many guys never stop. The season for me runs Oct-May with Oct/Nov and Mar/Apr being the prime months.  Plenty of great fishing in the winter months to be had.  It is imo the golden age of steelheading in the great lakes region. It's one of the very few fisheries we have here in southern ON that I would deem world class and is the doorstep of millions of people.  Nice fishing btw Emil, you're a machine."
654191,Rod Caster,2012-01-07 00:43:00,5784,"   ... and some guys catch them on the ice too, don't they? Your right Solo, you guys have a top-quality fishing opportunity with the steelhead. I only had one month of experience with them on the Notty before I moved away. I loved it even though I was hardly successful."
654192,Live2fish85,2012-01-07 00:43:00,1633,Nice work those are nice steelies.
654203,mikeseb,2012-01-07 00:56:00,201,Nice fish!!  Im gonna try and get out tomorrow weathers gonna be nice.
654204,misfish,2012-01-07 00:57:00,29133,Well done.
654219,BillM,2012-01-07 01:36:00,17367,Expect crowds at the _________  tomorrow!
654229,Twocoda,2012-01-07 01:59:00,4130, i was actually suprised the amount of people that dont work....was a friggin zoo up here today...tomorrow should be interesting...
654239,BillM,2012-01-07 02:38:00,17367,"I looked at the graph and it would have been dicey...  I had to work anyhow, lol!"
654265,FieroLuke,2012-01-07 05:07:00,24,"Nice fish, makes me hopeful for tomorrow.  Actually looking forward to having to work in Toronto next week, maybe I'll finally get that bigger river trip I have been trying for a few weeks.  "
654274,highdrifter,2012-01-07 08:59:00,2534," Exactly.  If there was no actual pic of the tag, why even give any clues??!!"
654275,limeyangler,2012-01-07 09:41:00,5204,And you are new to steelhead fishing?  Emil....you are slaying 'em amigo...WTG.  That looks a lot of fun.
654429,denisk,2012-01-07 23:02:00,163,"Now your hooked my friend, now your hooked LOL.   I know where I'm going tomorrow"
654485,SirCranksalot,2012-01-08 02:03:00,3291,Well I was at ________ today and there was nobody there!!
654486,BillM,2012-01-08 02:05:00,17367," I guess you missed a few of my buddies fishing _______ because they were there, lol."
654513,craigdritchie,2012-01-08 04:07:00,1586,I expect _________ might have been good today. But I went to ............. and it was outstanding.  It should be even better tomorrow.
654514,BillM,2012-01-08 04:11:00,17367,"Craig, tomorrow I'll be shooting _______ at _________ and not fishing _________.   If you do fish _______ good luck and let me know how you make out!"
654525,FieroLuke,2012-01-08 05:24:00,24,"I'll be going to _______ during the week, I like to avoid the crowds.  I think the weather will bring out more crowds to any fishable water rather than one remark about a tag.  I went to a different trib today and I caught some sunshine and good conversations with other fishermen, there was nothing being caught."
654533,GoneFishin,2012-01-08 07:01:00,349," That's what it's about. Get out there when every one has forgotten about it and have the time of your life. Just bring good gloves, it gets cold landing all those fish this time of year . Glad to hear someone is taking advantage of this weather, GJ."
