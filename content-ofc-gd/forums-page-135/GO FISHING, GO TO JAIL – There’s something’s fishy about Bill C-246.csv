Peterborough, Ont: Canadian families who fish together will do time together if Bill C-246 becomes law.  The ‘Modernizing Animal Protections Act” was introduced last week by Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith of Toronto. It is being promoted as legislation to ban of the importation of shark fins and outlaw the practice of shark finning in Canadian waters. But that is only the tip of the fin.  An activist coalition of Canadian and U.S. animal rights organizations with a decades-long history of sustained attacks on anglers and farmers quickly supported the private member’s bill. Led by the International Fund for Animal Welfare of Yarmouth, Massachusetts and the Toronto-based Animal Alliance of Canada, these groups have once again come out in strong support of federal legislation which threatens a criminal charge, up to a $10,000 fine and five years jail time for anglers who harvest a few fish for dinner.  Provisions in Bill C-246 clearly make it possible for someone who catches a fish to face criminal prosecution for cruelty to animals. Even the act of baiting a hook with a worm would be considered an act of cruelty according to the Bill.  Specifically, Section 182.1.1 states that:  182.1 (1) Everyone commits an offence who, willfully or recklessly, ( kills an animal or, being the owner, permits an animal to be killed, brutally or viciously, regardless of whether the animal dies immediately;  This section poses the same threat as the seven previous iterations of similar bills. According to exhaustive legal opinions, for the first time in Canadian history this section would make it an offence to kill an animal brutally or viciously – without defining those terms – and does not exempt from this offence normal hunting and fishing activities. Hunting and fishing necessarily involve the killing of animals. Animal rights groups consistently attempt to portray these traditional Canadian heritage activities as inherently brutal and vicious. If Bill C-246 becomes law, this section will be used by animal rights activists who will employ provisions of the Criminal Code to bring private prosecutions to harass lawful anglers and hunters.  “Once again we see the timeworn tactic by these MP’s and groups of fronting a façade which appears to promote a seemingly reasonable solution to an animal cruelty issue, while concealing the true intention of the legislation,” states Phil Morlock, Government Affairs Chair of the Canadian Sportfishing Industry Association. “The implications of this Bill are chilling. It is a nuclear strike against our outdoor heritage activities and threatens anyone who just wants to take their kids fishing.”  In a classic example of the relentless ‘under the radar’ attacks on the eight million Canadians who enjoy fishing, this Bill copies the same contentious phrasing that directly threatens anglers and which appeared in seven previous government Bills from 1999 – 2008. That legislation had strong support from M.P. Mark Holland who is now Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for Democratic Institutions, Maryam Monsef MP for Peterborough-Kawartha. Mr. Holland was quoted in the November 30, 2015 issue of The Hill Times newspaper as once again drafting similar ‘animal cruelty’ legislation.  “We’re urging all Canadian anglers who enjoy the freedom of fishing with their families without fear of prosecution to contact their Member of Parliament to express their opposition to Bill C-246,” added Morlock.  Anglers can access the contact information of their Member of Parliament by visiting www.keepcanadafishing.com.  – 30 –  The Canadian Sportfishing Industry Association (CSIA) represents the manufacturers, distributors, retailers and sales agencies which serve the 8 million Canadians who spend over $8 billion dollars annually enjoying the outdoor heritage activity of recreational fishing."

961421,Skud,2016-03-08 01:58:00,739,It is a reality that we will have to constantly fight.  People give millions of dollars to organizations like P3TA thinking the money will be used to save kitty cats and puppy dogs. Unfortunately the money is used to fund these crazy Bills and to pay off members of parliament to also support them and try to weasel them through to law.
961427,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-08 02:41:00,8243,I second that motion. I don't see anyone that practices angling for sports fish to ever be charged with cruelty if done in a responsible fashion as it is intended to be practiced. Fear mongering at it's best.
961431,dave524,2016-03-08 03:10:00,4508,"Sorry , not fear mongering , they get their foot in the door,  keep advancing their real agenda an inch at a time , you keep saying that don't sound too bad and eventually you have given away the farm."

961446,ehg,2016-03-08 04:31:00,2666,"A little over the top with the rhetoric and fear mongering I think....  The guy who wrote ""Go  fishing, Go to jail"" is Phil Morlock  who works for Shimano (80% bikes, 20% fishing). The guy lives in Arizona. Some how sending an email to this Peterborough room benefits Shimano. CSIA doesn't really exist except for e-mail listing.  Bill C-246 exists to legislate against importation of shark fins.  Cute how they put young girl fishing with Barbie rod and stating  in future $10,000 fine for hooking worm. Unless you buy Shimano. Need a bike part soon."

961468,netminder,2016-03-08 13:38:00,514,"Wait... hold on. Correct me if I'm wrong, but is this implying that animal cruelty legislation that's already on the books has no law against killing animals? You say hooking a worm is part of the offence, but if I swat a fly and don't kill it immediately I could be looking at a fine and jail time? Spraying crops with pesticide, or government forces fumigating against emerald ash borer or mosquitoes? Gassing is a war crime. What is this mass genocide perpetrated by our government going to be viewed as?  I find it more than a little amusing how terrified some of you are at fringe ""animal rights"" groups."

Unfortunately, at 65 I've seen the "" fringe "" become the norm 10/20 years down the road too many times in my lifetime to even take a single step down that road anymore. We must be vigilante and united as fishermen , hunters, trappers and shooting sports enthusiasts and stop being divided and our own worst enemy , throwing one another under the bus.  If we do not stand together we will fall individually. "
961470,Dara,2016-03-08 13:58:00,3052,No different that a year in jail for killing a sow bear with cubs...just a sneaky little tactic the government tosses in to get you when they have a grudge
961471,dave524,2016-03-08 14:10:00,4508,"I know it's a wiki quote but you can see where they can go with some of this wording, I always thought the Germans and Swiss had their heads screwed on tighter than some other Euro Countries, guess not.  "" In Switzerland and Germany, catch and release fishing is considered inhumane and is now banned.[5] In Germany, the Animal Welfare Act states that ""no-one may cause an animal pain, suffering or harm without good reason"".[6] This leaves no legal basis for catch and release due to its argued inherent lack of ""good reason"", and thus personal fishing is solely allowed for immediate food consumption. Additionally, it is against the law to release fish back into the water if they are above minimum size requirements and aren't aprotected species or in closed season. """

If we do not stand together we will fall individually.  Sure, but you didn't answer my original question(s). What is this changing? Just because they support it doesn't mean we have to oppose it. I think it's a good thing. I'm all for animal welfare and ethical treatment of animals. Just because they're on a farm or going to be eaten doesn't mean we get to torture them or abuse them. Opposing this bill is essentially saying that you're OK with animal abuse. I don't think that is what hunters and anglers want to be associated with, lest we want the general public against us too.  The other key component to this is the words ""brutally or viciously"". I'm not sure how the law defines those two words, but I can't imagine stunning the fish with a blow to the head or putting it on ice would be considered either of those two things. Filleting it as soon as it comes out of the water while it's still alive, probably."

I consider a bullet to the brain or decapitation as humane but because of the associated gore factor many could say they are vicious or brutal."
