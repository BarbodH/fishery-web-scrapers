Very proud of my boy, took to snorkelling like a pro! We even saw a stingray!  "
961654,grimsbylander,2016-03-09 20:46:00,3016,"Awesome video. Your son is so comfortable in the water, looks very natural to him. That swim alone would make the trip worthwhile."
961667,LeXXington,2016-03-09 21:45:00,1928,"Cool,"
961669,irishfield,2016-03-09 21:53:00,26272,Nice Simon! One thing I remember about Antigua is lots of Fire Coral. Make sure you both know what it looks like...
961670,Duckie,2016-03-09 21:58:00,305,"very cool. I have been travelling to Antigua my whole life, love that island. pretty much every march break while growing up, and we have been twice in the last few years as an adult. We stay at Jolly Harbour now, but used to stay at Runaway Bay back in the 80's and 90's. last year we did the stingray swim on the east side of the island near Devil's Bridge. amazing.  great video!"

961764,Joey,2016-03-10 14:03:00,9122,Very cool Simon.  Jack has just been a gem in all your videos.  Very cool to watch him grow up and take to the elements.  He's probably done more than I have in all my life  He's a very lucky boy and you two have a bond that is super fantastic.  Keep the vids and pics coming bud

Not much to worry about in that respect, most of the inshore coral is dead, warming, pollution and hurricanes. I did get stuck by a black sea urchin last year…holy OUCH!   very cool.

That is so cool, we are not far from Devil's Bridge, just a short drive through Freetown down to Willikies.    great video Simon ! Just needs some Harry Belafonte music ...
