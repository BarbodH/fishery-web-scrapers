Float goes down and I'm snagged.., I tug a few times and I finally manage to get it out. On the end of my line is a berkley green worm and is hooked perfectly on my hook.  I tell my buddy Jimmy to check it out and he told me to leave it on and drift...  On the third drift... float starts moving towards me!?!?  FISH ON!!!!!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZLlKvdWnU8&list=UUHLsyoTmKnf5avHlwlcBN6w"

960702,PUMP KNOWS,2016-03-02 16:01:00,937,I was completely off guard... I was fishing this pool for 20mins and not even a sign that there was fish.  I was very lucky to pull this one out of there.
