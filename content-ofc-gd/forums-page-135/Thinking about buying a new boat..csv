Porkpie that boat is only a tiller with no side console I also just did a build on the Lund sitell and I built basically the same one as the legend with a 25hp and it came out to 13500 but I'm not sure if that's U.S currency Take a very close look at Polar Kraft.......they are giving Lund a run for their money because it's built with the same quality but you are not paying for the Lund name (Lund are very find boats but expensive IMHO)  Polar Kraft has just as many models as Lund and they are built like tanks and as some dealers told me last year, the smaller Lunds don't have the quality like they use to and the Polar Kraft actually are better in the size you are looking at.  http://www.polarkraftboats.com/  I have the Polar Kraft Frontier 179 WT with a 90 HO E-TEC on the back  which is much larger then you are looking at but they have smaller Frontier also plus many other models depending on how big or small the waters are you intend to use it.  I do agree that the Legend is WAY under powered get close to max if not max especially is those smaller boats because 2 or three guys and you will never plane out and that really SUCKS to be in a boat like that."
960300,Mister G,2016-02-29 13:24:00,1429,"Don't forget most 15hp are a 9.9 with a bigger carb. 25 is usually a 20 with a bigger carb. You get the idea. Get as big a motor as you can afford. Honestly if cash is the concern I would sooner buy the rig, sell the motor and buy a bigger used one. You are close but actually outboard manufactures really build say a 25 hp motor and then down tune it to a 20 hp.......don't know about these smaller outboards but once you get up to the 40 hp + models they are fuel injected and the computer mapping in the motor will let it make 40 hp or 50 hp or 60 hp all from the exact same outboard.....same is true with the larger motors like the 90 HO, 115, 115 HO, 135, 135 HO, 150 or 150 HO from E-TEC and the same holds true for Merc."

As a current boat owner, I'm sure you know, that if they're well maintained, and stored properly a lot of boats in Ontario have very short seasons (low hours for their age), and can still be in top shape even if 5 or years old.  I'll just throw something out there in the link that I think would be better..  Keep in mind too that this isn't a good time of year for people to be selling used boats, so there's not as many good options out there as there will be in 2 or 3 months.

959611,Lape0019,2016-02-25 16:31:00,647,"You've got two things going against you in this thread. You are asking about a Legend and you are considering under powering it. As a whole, I believe a Legend is a good boat. They just play mind tricks with you and you are falling for them which many many people do.  Both Tracker and Legend do this. They package a boat at a price point that makes people feel comfortable. After a year or two, they realize this boat does not perform the way it should...  The fact is, only you can answer this question but IMO (and many others here), that boat needs at least a 30 on it before 90% of the educated boaters will be happy with it. I've been in boats that are underpowered like that, it sucks not even being able to get on plane.  My own boat is rated for a 135 and has a 75 on it ( A Bass Tracker at that). I bought it this way not knowing any better but I also got lucky because the gearing will turn a bigger prop and I can still reach decent speeds. And speed isn't the major faster here, look at other items like fuel. Say you like cruising at 20MPH, that 15 might get you there ( I doubt it) but it will be at full pin, a 30 or 40 will get you there and more put will be at 3000-3500 RPM which will reduce your fuel consumption and make that motor run a lot longer without issue.  I get that warranty is important to you but what is really wrong with your old boat? would $1000-$1500 not fix it to the point where it would be good for another 10-15 years? Add that to the price of a new 25 and you are still ahead of buying a new boat and will have the warranty on the most important part. Most boat warranties don't cover half of the items you think they will anyway so before buying a new boat, read the warranty carefully.  And for the record, I know that the Tracker bashers were more than likely talking about the deep v hulls but my mod v has quite a dry ride and I would gladly buy another one. The only thing I would do different is max out the power to as close as possible (Merc doesn't make a 125 right now so it would be a 115...)."
959639,Tjames09,2016-02-25 17:46:00,664,"Somewhat unrelated but maybe helpful:  I got stuck out on Sturgeon in huge waves before a nasty storm rolled in. We were at the north end of Sturgeon and needed to head all the way back to the river. The waves were going directly west to east, and we needed to go south. My in-laws have an old boat not meant for fish with a 50 on it. The boat can go fast and gets on plane (I never realized it was possible for a boat NOT to get on plane). Anyways, I tried to boat back on plane (probably 75% throttle), and it was scary as hell bouncing all over the waves, it was definitely not safe trying to ride the tops of the waves bouncing from side to side. I ended up lowering the throttle to like 25% and driving on an angle in sort of the wrong direction zig zagging my way back riding the waves. It wasnt safe to ride the top of the waves with the amount of wind and the size of the waves.  I get what everyones saying in this thread about having power, but I feel like no matter the boat or the power, some storms you gotta go slow and ride the waves."

In my opinion, I believe you need more power. I would not be happy if my boat had a 15 or 25.  You're not me, so it's your call. I'm just speaking from experience owning a similar boat."
959675,Lape0019,2016-02-25 20:57:00,647,"JohnBacon,  Yes, They were known to crack and I too was concerned about this when I bought my boat but it seemed to have been related to specific models. All of the research I could find was the older 175TXW and the Avalanche boats. The avalanche was an aluminum formed bass boat ( I think a member her had one sink?) which they do not make anymore and aside from a thread every year or two about a hull cracking in their mod v because of a bad weld in the stringer, the issue does not seem to be as big as it once was.  My 190TX is a 2006 and it has quite a dry ride. The only time I have water in my bilge is it I take a wave over the back but coming off plane too quickly.  But for a boat like the OP is looking for, I have never read a single report or review of their Deep V boats cracking."
959698,gaspumper,2016-02-25 23:38:00,393,"You all are beating a dead horse.The op has his mind set on getting the boat that he posted,your not going to change his mind,his money, he cannot blame anyone down the road when he is not happy."
959704,jedimaster,2016-02-26 00:11:00,3472,"Omg, do NOT buy that rig with a 15 are you crazy? I had a Lund with a deck in the front and floors and I had a 30hp 3cyl Yamaha. It hauled and got on plane great. A 3 cylinder minimum 30 hp. There is a big torque difference between the 2 cyl and 3 cyl outboards. A 15 may not even get on plane. That is very very very dangerous and will lead to long term reliability issues. Think about it. You say you wanna go slow, well a 15 plotting at full tilt will be slow every single time your in it. With a 30 you will jump on plane and then throttle back and cruise comfortably. It's not just safety and performance but longevity as wel. Outboards are expensive to replace. Jmho"

That's like saying my trucks towing capacity is 10,000lb. Now should you be towing 10,000lbs? Probably not. That's probably on a good day with the wind at your back and going downhill. Now 8,000lb seems like a more safe safe weight. So for me same goes for a boat. A few mentioned going with 75% perfect of the maximum so that would be a 30hp that just makes more common sense to me.I question putting the maximum on the boat because it's probably the max weight the transom can handle and max power. Now can the hull handle that amount of speed and power of the max? No wonder way other say the hulls crack. They probably have the max and are out running a storm smashing waves. Now a few have mentioned brands but nobody has mentioned any models or anything comparable. And now Dara since you know what waters I fish what would you recommend for me?"

Not sure what vehicle you drive, or how far you would tow the boat,  but get the biggest you can afford,  for the K Lakes can blow up fast.  A good size out there would be 16 ft deep V with at least a 50 hp on it.  If you buy small now I am sure that soon it would be ""I should have got something bigger"".  They are out there.

959932,landry,2016-02-27 01:35:00,1005,Wormdangler - I am sorry but you are wrong. You are obviously an inexperienced boater and that's fine - we all were once. Listen to the overwhelming awesome advices oven here. You can afford a 16' with a 50 horse - no need to spend 20 grand. It's a free world though - I just think you should stop convincing/arguing that the boat you are looking at is a good setup. It IS NOT but it will get you fishing so I guess it could be worse.
959944,pike slayer,2016-02-27 02:27:00,1177,You correct I've been fishing for years but I don't have alot of experience with larger boats. I've always had 12'tinners canoes and picked up an older 16' a while back and i really enjoy some of the cpmfprts it has to offer.just seems like everything else in life you shouldn't be maxing out things. I see where you are coming from that my convincing/arguing but nobody has shown me any type of link or even a picture of another new boat to compare to. It might be wiser for most to buy used but I always buy used junk and just this one time I want something new. I have big plans in my head to put a ton of hours on it.

Saved nearly $10,000 over a comparable boat listed now.  You can search by year, by price, by brand, by length etc... keep at it, I looked for several months before I found the perfect boat for me. Go out to a couple of dealers and hop into a boat or 2. Look at floor space, live well size, rod storage length, other storage areas, portable or fixed gas tank, console size and features, seating.... You won't be able to get a sense of most of these things unless you are physically in the boat. I eliminated one boat that was on my short list (a very short, short list) by setting foot in the boat at a dealer. Go to a boat show and do the same to narrow things down. Good luck"
960244,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-29 01:07:00,8243,"In the event you do decide to look at used boats I found this in an old file of mine. From iboats. It will come in handy for you or anyone thinking of buying a boat in the future, myself included.    A Good Buyers check list.   The absolute FIRST and MOST important question you should ask the seller is this.  DO YOU HAVE THE PROPER PAPERWORK.  The boat is a useless paperweight without it.  Absolutely positively DO NOT believe that obtaining a title is easy because in most cases it isn't. As a matter of fact offer the seller an extra $100.00 to get the proper paperwork, I bet you 95% of the time the seller will say no at that point walk away no matter how pretty and shiny the boat is WALK AWAY.  We are going to Start with the hull.  The hull.   Start at the bow outside and work your way back.  Go over it from bow to stern with a fine tooth comb Are there any major knicks or gashes.  Are there any splits in the fiberglass.  Look for gel coat spidering or stress cracks.  Is the gel coat or paint faded or is bright as if it has been cared for?  Is the hull straight no major dents in especially on the bottom side. I.e. an obviously visible hook in the hull.  Is there barnacle build up on it anywhere?  How does the rub rail look is it mashed in anywhere? (signs that a boat was owned by an inexperienced owner).  Look for brown water staining visible around the transom motor mount bolts streaking down from them (for an outboard).  Look for brown water staining streaking down from the splashwell plug (again an outboard).  Look at the trim i.e. (lights, rubrail trim, horns, anything metal) does it look pitted and corroded or well maintained?  Move to the inside of the hull.  Start from bow to stern  How is the general condition of the upholstery does it look well cared for?  How solid is the floor in ALL spots if it is spongy squishy or weak in any spots walk away (unless you are looking for a project). Don't believe that it is going to be a simple fix boats tend to rot from the bottom up.  Lift all the hatches and look underneath are there any signs of dampness or rot?  Poke prod and feel everything especially all of the hidden areas.  Look in the ski locker if equipped how does it look any signs of dampness or rot?  Look at the seat bases for signs of dampness and rot.  Look at the carpet is moldy and mildewed, or does it have normal wear.  If the floor is Plywood encased in fiberglass which is painted look for signs of delamination (fiberglass pulling up).  Test all of the electronics.  Make sure the bow and stern light are functioning properly. Make sure the horn is working properly. Make sure the bilge pump and blower are working properly. Follow the wires do they look like they are properly connected and running through proper USCG approved fuse boxes? Does the wiring look like proper marine grade wire. Test the radio and speakers make sure they are connected and working properly. Test the steering to make sure it functions properly and easily.  Move to the stern. Lift all of the hatches and motor cover.  Inspect the motor mounts do they look dry and clean inspect for dampness and rot.  How does the bilge look is it clean or has someone been draining the oil into the bilge?  Are there signs of brown water stains in the bilge area?  Inspect the transom from the inside look for signs of rot.  Tap on the inside of the transom with a rubber mallet how does it sound does it sound rock solid or kind of hollow does it feel solid or does it feel like mush.  Am I missing something here because as far as someone sending you links to new boats and respective prices it is up to you to do that. It's called shopping around."

959460,chris.brock,2016-02-25 00:18:00,4053,"thanks steve, I guess my insurance rates will go down when I upsize the outboard on my boat or buy a sports car, because I can outrun crap and it's ""safer"""

959470,pike slayer,2016-02-25 00:42:00,1177,I see everyone is saying go with the max power but I feel a 25hp 4stroke would haul across the lake with that boat pretty good. My old 25hp johnson does fine and my boat is a heavy old boat. I can't see a live well slowly me down to a crawl. I fish inland lakes I wouldn't be on the great Lakes or simcoe.
959473,Terry,2016-02-25 00:46:00,14456,"well don't say we did not warn you you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him get up on plane lol"
959474,Pigeontroller,2016-02-25 00:57:00,2793,For the money you're thinking about spending I'd look at used stuff...
959475,chris.brock,2016-02-25 01:05:00,4053,"you want to call me out, ok  so explain how a more powerful boat is safer  for every reason you give, I'll give you a bunch that more power and speed can lead to trouble for the newbee, citiot, idiot boater you were eluding to"
959477,spincast,2016-02-25 01:15:00,3279,"Most of the research recommends that the best combination of price and power is  at 75% of maximum rating.  Will this boat get you fishing?  Yes, so long as you stay on small lakes and never have to worry about beating out a weather front.  Will you be happy, with that motor a year form now? Probably not, and upgrading later is waaaay more expensive then what you can negotiate when you purchase. Lots of good hulls to choose from out there. I personally am a Starcraft fan. But Starcraft, Smokercraft and Sylvan are all owned by the same company.  And those in the know say that Smokercraft makes some Legend hulls. I've never owned one, but the two or three folks I know that do , they like 'em. Its just that power issue, Personally, I'd upgrade the motor to at least a 40, if not a 50,and compare to the used market, And don't settle for what they advertise or offer. Ask for what you want at the price you are wiling to pay (within reason)., It may take several dealers, but patience has its own rewards. The deal I ended up shaking on was turned down by four dealers in a row, Whatever you decide, good luck, and share your new toy when she comes home"
959479,Terry,2016-02-25 01:36:00,14456,"balsam lake i had to put a 25 hp motor on my boat because I blew the 50 horse the weekend before walleye opening that weekend the wind came up and we had to get back to the ramp into the wind it would not stay up on plane because it was under powered trying to push into the waves the boat was plowing and water was coming over the front  so we had to slow down, the waves, wind  and current were going faster then we were going we were losing ground we were taking on water  in the end we had to turn around and go with the waves i tried to make it to the river but in the end i had to just beach it and hitch hick back to the truck the problem was an under powered motor  , most good dealers will tell you to buy close to max hp, safer and a lot less hard on the motor too"
959482,Bondar,2016-02-25 01:52:00,817,"Buy something like the one below and you'll be very happy with it, fully rigged will do like 30-32mph good on gas. You won't have to run it all the time at WOT to get somewhere. Can haul you and 2 buddys with gear no problem. Time you start putting battery's, trolling motors, full tank of fuel, anchors ropes etc etc.You'll spend most of your fishing time crawling to your spot with that under powered boat.

959491,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-25 02:37:00,8243,"I agree with both of you. I always thought if you had enough speed(power) you could outrun a storm. Nope. Running atop meter high or more waves at 40MPH isn't safe to me. I couldn't do it. I could feel the boat getting away from me side to side. You ride the wave like a duck does I have since learned. I just like the stability of a heavier deep V Star Craft that I have.  In the other hand not being able to get on plane is a batch too. In calmer water with wind it can be dangerous as going into a wind with a light boat bow high is just as hairy. Listening and feeling every wave that feels like it is coming over the bow or through the hull sucks too, worse actually.  It looks like the OP wants a underpowered cheaply made boat based on his last post, Legends are cheaply made boats. So be it, his coin, his choice. I don't know why he asked for opinions.  Good luck Worm Dangler."
959497,porkpie,2016-02-25 02:42:00,2521,"OP, if you want to buy an underpowered boat, by all means don't listen to the bulk of advice to the contrary that you've been given.  It's your cash, and we all need to make our own way in the world, we are all grown ups here ( presumably).  If you feel you'll be happy with that rig, then go for it.  However it's been pointed out that you can have something a bit better at a price your willing to pay by buying a boat that's a few years old."

What all of you guys are talking about is spending $20,000plus. I'd love to but I cant. I just want something reliable with a warranty and I fish small lakes. Ive had a 12' tinned with a 9.9hp for years. I've got stuck in bad storms and I found driving slow with the waves was the way to go. There was one time I got stuck on an island cause I was camping on it. Check the weather before you go, plan your trip, and boat safely."

Just a thought: If you buy new you are going to loose probably 20% the minute you sign the papers. We are looking at motor homes and originally thought new would be the way to go. Several people suggested that we would save so much by buying used that if it was necessary to do any repairs we would still be way ahead to have bought used.  After doing a lot of research we found that boy were they right and that if you shop wisely and get things checked out by a good mechanic that you get a lot more bang for your buck by going used.  Example: I paid over $22,000.00 for my boat + taxes in 2009, it is like new (less than 200 hours on it) always stored inside, but if I was to sell it today I would probably take a 5 to 7K loss on it simply because it is 7 years old."
959566,Dara,2016-02-25 14:15:00,3052,"The floor, steering, live well etc add a lot of weight to the boat, and a 4 stroke doesn't run like a 2 stroke.  You will not be happy with the power, even my 60 has trouble loaded and into the wind.  I know the type of stuff you fish and thats not the rig you want"
959567,landry,2016-02-25 14:16:00,1005,"With the dollar as low as it is, buying in Ontario is your best option. Good used boats are a little tougher to find at a great price as a result but buying used is likely still the best route. This ""safety"" debate is kind of silly. Both sides re correct. However, always buy a boat at or at least at 75% of the max rating. This is a no brainer. You will enjoy using the boat AND good luck selling it if u don't."
959212,pike slayer,2016-02-24 01:48:00,1177,"I currently have an ""antique"" 16' aluminum boat with a 1979 johnson 25hp. It has the side console with casting deck and flat deck and front mount trolling motor. Ive been having problems starting the motor, I've been blowing rivets in the hull and the deck is starting to get soft. I just don't trust it and am getting annoyed. So I'm looking at just buying new so I have warranty and hope years of headache free fishing. So I'm looking at this boat.http://legendboats.com/boat/prosport-sc/?postal_one=P6b+5v6#.Vsz7A25MG2d What do yous think of legend boats? Also with the base price it only comes with a 15hp 4stroke. Seems like they put unpowered motors on to make the price look better. Although I only fish inland lakes, I don't need some super fast boat. I just want a reliable boat that trolls good. Maybe upgrade it to the 20hp?"
959214,Steve,2016-02-24 01:53:00,2075,"Don't buy a legend or tracker if you're going to fish in any type of rough water.  BUT if your only using it on small cottage lakes, I'm sure it would be great for your needs.  Legend and Tracker are both famous for under powering their packaged boats...if an informed buyer looks at the cost of upgrading to a proper sized motor, than the price quickly becomes the same as a Lund, Alumicraft, Lowe, Princecraft, Crestliner, etc.  One thing I always tell folks is a legend or tracker on the water (so long as it is still floating) is better than standing on shore."
959215,Raf,2016-02-24 01:54:00,3495,You would want at least a 25 if not a 30 on that boat.  Max is 40.
959216,John Bacon,2016-02-24 01:55:00,3277,"Seems like they put unpowered motors on to make the price look better.  Yes, Legend boats are known for that.  I think that Legend boats are fine.  Legend does not make their own hulls.  SmokerCraft makes a lot of their hulls.  I do think Legend adds their one accessories.  I think a 20hp (let alone 15hp) is too small for that boat.  I recommend that you get close to the max HP so that it will get up on plane.  You can back off on the throttle once you're on plane.  "
959217,Steve,2016-02-24 01:58:00,2075,"I don't know how it is even legal for Legend to sell that boat in that shape.  It would not be safe on the water...would not be able to plane....  I know there is a certain legend sponsored angler on this board who will defend legend for putting drastically under powered motors on their boats...but do consider the source.  that boat should have a 30hp as a ""minimum"" with a 40hp as a option.  I believe it should illegal for a boat manufacturer to package a boat and motor option with the motor less than 75% of the recommended hp."
959221,glen,2016-02-24 02:04:00,2641,If you plan on driving around with water in the live well. That's 120 lbs to slow you down too. Do you have a place to store it inside?
959223,chris.brock,2016-02-24 02:23:00,4053,"Gotta ask, how is not being able to plane more dangerous?"
959227,Steve,2016-02-24 02:33:00,2075,"when you can't plane you plow water, burn extra gas, and depending on the body of water, could put yourself in a serious situation.  a boat should be equipment with an motor designed for it....  if a 16' boat is designed for a 40hp motor, it should be illegal to offer a 15hp motor on it.  Now, if someone wants to buy a 15hp motor, and add it to the boat, so be it....  But you know the folks buying 16' side console boats with 15hp motors simply don't know any better....  you would be hard pressed to find a Lund, Princecraft, Crestliner, etc offering packages with outboards rated at 33% of the hp rating."
959228,pike slayer,2016-02-24 02:34:00,1177,I have an open lean to that I store my boat in. It's not a fully in closed garage that's for sure haha.
959229,glen,2016-02-24 02:40:00,2641,As long as you can dry it out and keep it dry or it will rot too.  How fast does your old boat go.   Is it fast enough.  A new 25 will be faster then your old one.
959230,pike slayer,2016-02-24 02:49:00,1177,I'm not sure exactly how fast it goes but it just planes out on a good day but is plenty fast for me.
959231,chris.brock,2016-02-24 02:49:00,4053,"No way.  For the people your are talking about an under powered boat is safer.  We got enough, we don't need anymore laws and regulation."
959233,Terry,2016-02-24 02:59:00,14456,"on simcoe and even on balsam  an under powered boat is dangerous if wind and waves come up and you cant get up on plane to go into the waves to get back to the launch , then you must go with the waves you cant go very fast because you will plow water or the front of the boat will be high obstructing your view and making it easy for a rouge wave to spin the boat around"
959234,John Bacon,2016-02-24 03:01:00,3277,I agree that there are situations were being underpowered is a safety issue; but I wouldn't want the government to start making laws about minimum horse power.
959235,porkpie,2016-02-24 03:02:00,2521,"By the time you buy that boat with a proper motor, which imo should be at least a. 30, but more likely a 40 , you'd be at the price of a major brand.  This dealer is in Thunder Bay, but I'm pretty sure you can get a similar price around here. This is just an example.  $16k for a superior boat with a 40, vs 12K for a legend with a barely serviceable motor that won't even get you on plane.  Just for example see link. http://www.kijiji.ca/v-powerboat-motorboat/thunder-bay/lund-1600-fury-with-40hp-mercury/1099402076?enableSearchNavigationFlag=true  I'd sooner buy a boat that was a couple year old but in good condition than buy that underpowered tub.  Give Hastings marine a call.  I bought a Lund brand new from them in 2001, and they where great to deal with.  Anyone else I've talked to since that has dealt with them has had nothing but good to say."

959259,Steve,2016-02-24 04:12:00,2075,"Thankfully some sense on this thread.  No way is it safe to have an under powered boat.  All I'm saying is, you shouldn't be allowed to sell an un-safe boat.  Yes Chris, you don't believe there is such a thing...but the rest of the boating world knows differently.  Hopefully worm dangler will heed the advice of the majority and buy a boat that has a proper motor to push it....even if it is used.  I bought my 1998 Lund with 1999 Yamaha in 2004. I still have the boat today. Hasn't left me stranded anywhere....not even once.  But I was smart enough to buy a Lund / Yamaha combo.  Had I bought a new Legend / Tracker with an under powered Merc (cause that is the cheapest motor to offer) I surely wouldn't be using the same boat today...not a chance."
959266,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-24 04:50:00,8243,"You will get a very nice used boat for that price. It is very dangerous to not be able to get a boat on plane. I nearly flipped a Jon boat when I came around a corner and the wind picked the front of that boat enough to get water coming into it quickly at the transom.  I know for a fact you will not be happy with that boat woefully under powered.  A boat cover will keep a boat dry, I shrink wrap mine every year too make sure it's nice and dry every spring.  Wormdunker even though you don't have a fully enclosed garage you have a Lund, no comparison at all.  Worm Dangler shop around and look at higher priced boats for comparison. Look at the difference in fit and finish. Smoker Craft may make the hull but to Legends specs, I bet the hulls with the Smoker Craft logo on it is much better built. Down to the number of rivets on the hull. I looked at a Tracker parked outside of Bass Pro. All the compartments were 1/2 full of water, things like the water tightness of live wells etc. are the things to look for. Down to the flimsy tin latches. The width of the gunnels on those boats look as solid as a 12 foot Sears car topper. Cheap boats because they are built cheaply.  Keep looking if you intend on keeping the boat for a few happy years. I would looked for twice the boat used for the same price, and not underpowered."

Figure a budget and go from there...you can get a nice wide deep 14 with a 20 tiller that will work just fine where you fish If you want a 16 with just a 25 you have to go open boat with tiller and  no extra weight  While smoker craft or whatever may make legend hulls, they don't make them to the same specifications"
959294,Sinker,2016-02-24 14:34:00,8692,"Check out starcraft boats too.  I'm also in the max power fan club. My boat wouldn't be the same without the max power. Responsive and great handling all comes with max power. Better control is never a bad thing.  That said, if you look at a lot of the fishing boats on the east coast you will find they are underpowered. My dad has a 22ft fiberglass boat with a 70 yammy. It is  a dog to get on plane, but she rides the big north atlantic swells like a bird. Load it up with a load of fish or whatever and she handles them even better. My grandfather spent his life fishing on the north atlantic and the first thing he told me about running a boat is float like a bird. He fished for many, many years out of a 30 foot wooden trap skiff with a 6 hp diesel make and break engine, and he was not one to back down from big weather. You can ride out some big water going slow. Big water doesn't always mean big power, but I still prefer max power.....better to have it than not.    S."
