961058,misfish,2016-03-05 18:46:00,29133,"I did manage to get a couple for a feed for dinner. The walk was not friendly, but cant complain as it,s been easy all season . I managed to get almost spot on my spot even with the snow coverage. For the first time in many years, the water was dirty. I couldnt see my williams 6 ft down, yet the fish were there still.  A nice eater whitie ( this one was a stocker) and another big herring.    They love taking the side hook.    Sunday will probly be my last trip on Simcoe as Im sure by next weekend, it will be sketchy.          Play safe out there if your heading out.  B"
961059,misfish,2016-03-05 19:02:00,29133,"Funny, I just noticed the first pic shows 18 fow. Wierd. Maybe due to the water and all the fish."

961074,icefisherman,2016-03-05 21:27:00,952,"Good report Brian. Amazed at how you and another buddy of mine keep getting great results using the Williams spoon. I used to use it more regularly but got tired of is and only use it as a last option tool ;-) particularly in deep water. But it does work....  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
