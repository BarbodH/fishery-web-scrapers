961160,chris.brock,2016-03-06 22:17:00,4053,"Glad to hear that Chris. Imagine the damage we could have done if Bain and Julian had made it out too.  For the record, I was 1 for 2, Brown and Kewley especially were putting numbers of fish on the ice."
961165,Jds63,2016-03-06 22:55:00,1365,Really wish I could have made it . A little competition is always fun ... Lol
