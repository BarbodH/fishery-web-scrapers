But i meant hot food not spicy.  I once accidentally fed some hot supper to our boxer that past 7 years ago.  It vacated everything in his stomach, and i mean everything!  Ive never seen soooo much puke."
961752,DanD,2016-03-10 13:04:00,2223,"Years ago, a few days before Christmas, my then 7 year old daughter and the wife, built a gingerbread house. This thing was 2'X2'X2' high, had to weigh at least 20Lbs. We went to my Dad's place for Xmas eve and left the gingerbread house on the dinning room table. We get home and there's not a crumb left of it to be found and I mean nothing; as if it never existed. Stalker our 30+ inch tall doberman, who always greeted us at the door, was also nowhere to be seen. Go down to the laundry room and there he was sound asleep, on a pile of dirty close; had to give him a nudge to wake him up. As he stood up, I called to my wife and said I think I found the house; the dog's belly had a soccer ball sized bulge on/in it. I was worried at first that he had gorged himself; but after he drank about a gallon of water he seemed fine. Now the daughter who, like I said was 7, was standing at the front door, one hand on her hip and the other arm stretched out, with a finger pointing at the door. In a calm and what sounded like an adult voice says ""This dog has to go"". LOL Stalker missed Xmas morning with us that year; he was to busy spray painting the back yard with gingerbread.  Dan.  "
961757,Joey,2016-03-10 13:39:00,9122,"Was talking to my sister about this thread as she has had alot of dogs.  She told me her white Shepherd ate everything and also used to steal the bagels from the counter and hide them in the couch, under the cushions.  She said one time she put all the groceries on the floor to put away and got distracted.  The dog ate a whole lb of butter and a whole raw chicken, bones and all.  Lived through it all, but had a few ""moments"" outside"
961768,LeXXington,2016-03-10 14:25:00,1928,"My dog eats anything the kids leave on the floor, counter, rooms... Many a Lego Men have take the trip through the secret passage to come out and appear in the back yard.  I have tried putting wasabi, hot sauce, pepper you name it on the small toys as bait... No affect in they go.  I have caught him with his head in the Lego box searching for the right piece to eat.  I have full pet insurance.  At 3 years old I thought he would outgrow it but nope."

961790,Headhunter,2016-03-10 16:42:00,5703,"I just recalled the time we were enjoying a bag of Salt and Vinegar ships. My dog loves chips, but I certain he wouldn't want anything to do with salt and vinegar. So, as I am enjoying the chips, he parks himself in front of me. I hold out a chip and his lips curl up and he starts shaking his head. I said to him, ""come on, you know you want to eat it"". He came back for another sniff. Lips and snout all curled up, he backs away again. I repeated my last statement, ""come on, yo know you want it"" to which he comes over, grabs the chip, lips and snout all curled up and down it goes. He once tried to eat our butter dish, but it fell to the floor and the plate shattered. I was out for no more than 1/2 an hour and when I walked into the house, there was blood all along the walls, the floors, you name it! I thought someone had broken int my house and killed my dog! Well, I found him in my son's room, lying on the bed. He had cut his tongue on the broken plate and tried to stop the bleeding by rubbing his face all over my walls and floor! HH"
961828,netminder,2016-03-10 21:39:00,514,Forgot to mention my dog used to like to eat cat litter. If we left the door to the laundry room open every now and then she'd come over to us and her breath would absolutely reek and there would be grey maxx scoop caked into her gumline. I didn't dare ask which were the tastiest bits.  I found this odd because if I threw a ball in the yard and it went within 10 feet of a pile of poo she would refuse to pick it up. Apparently cat poo is OK though.
961831,grimsbylander,2016-03-10 22:25:00,3016,"This is actually therapeutic. Of all the dogs I've had over the years, this pup is the craziest and I was starting to think he was especially nuts. I going to try to convince myself he'll grow out of it!"
961833,SuperDave,2016-03-10 22:31:00,204,"My yellow lab is the strangest lab ever. While teething did cause him to eat some baseboards and table legs, he sometimes will barely touch his food. He eats on his terms and that's it. He wont touch the cats food, but I have to scare the cats off his food. He is almost 4 and still has stuffed animals that he got as a puppy. He never eats shoes, towels, underwear, socks, wont even chase a squirrel lol. He is the kindest gentlest soul. He did destroy the pool cover and uproot a few shrubs as a pup though lol"

961890,Tom McCutcheon,2016-03-11 01:47:00,627,"50 plus years ago, my sister had a beautiful Chesapeake Bay retriever.  ""Henry"" goofy animal, playful as heck and loved everybody including cats and squirrels. She had a new townhouse with a duplex next door. We were invited to her place for Christmas dinner and while everyone is indulging in tasty libations and before dinner finger food, a knock comes at the front door. It was her neighbor. It seems she had put their fresh out of the oven turkey out the back door to rest while the table was being set for her families dinner and Henry had jumped the fence and ate the turkey. Every time a Christmas Story comes on the stupid Bumphouses Dogs reminds me of this. My brother in law had to jump in his car and go and buy 3 big buckets of KFC.  Glad your pup is alright."
961603,grimsbylander,2016-03-09 16:16:00,3016,"We lost our 13 year old yellow lab just before Christmas this year and decided we'd wait 6 months to one year before we'd think about replacing him. Two weeks of dead quite nights and nobody greeting us the door later, the hunt for a new pup was full on. The void he left was shocking. So, January 18 we picked up an 8 week old goldendoodle who despite the pee, poop, chewing, crying, mouthing, and jumping, became the center of the universe here in one week flat. Two days ago he starting to vomit...a lot! Short story, emergency visit at 9pm, xrays at 10pm, and surgery to remove a piece of metal that had pierced his intestine at 1am!  The buggar has eaten dryer sheets, toilet paper, leafs and wood but metal?? The bill so far is about $3500 and there is another appointment in 2 weeks to get the staples out. The good news is, by sheer luck, when we took him in for his first shots in February, the vet's office signed him up for 30 days of free pet insurance - that expired 3 days after the surgery! Still expensive but no where near $3500. Our lab once ate a Timex watch, velcro strap and all. It showed up on the lawn a day later. The vet told me he took a whole tea towel out of a golden retriever last month. Any interesting dinners for your dogs?"
961610,OhioFisherman,2016-03-09 17:02:00,6623,"Ouch! I have had my dog now for almost 10 years, he behaves more like a human than some humans! LOL Outside of sticks in the yard, which he insists need killing by breaking them in pieces, and chasing the animals that wander into my yard he doesn't mess with stuff that isn't his.  i was disabled and retired when I got him though, and had plenty of time to teach him the acceptable conduct. LOL Just a great dog! and much easier to train than a wife!"

I just got a new kitten and he just about tries to eat whatever he can, especially plastic wrappers from granola bars etc, he also managed to get a hold of a halls throat lozenge and he throws it around all by himself and keeps himself entertained for hours doing that haha, when I come home it looks like a bomb went off with his toys strewn across the main floor, basement and upstairs"
961616,netminder,2016-03-09 17:17:00,514,"Anything that gets left outside either on the ground or on the patio table is fair game for my mut. Anything from hats to metal barbeque utensils to meat thermometers, paper, socks... pretty much anything. But I could leave a sandwich on the coffee table inside all day and she wouldn't touch it though!  Good to know the dog is OK now. You'd almost think they were built to do stupid stuff like that!"

961622,captpierre,2016-03-09 17:35:00,2521,"As a vet I always recommend insurance at the first puppy visit. At least for  the first year. Preferably for life. Young dogs get into all kinds of trouble. Your story is common. Foreign body obstructions, quills, broken bones, nasty lacerations, those hit by cars. Pet health insurance is about $50 per month. Many people have thanked me over the years for recommending it. It often pays off huge. And allows the best care available instead of plans B, C etc. There are lots of insurance providers.

961635,crappieperchhunter,2016-03-09 18:16:00,2582,"We had a Doberman/Sheppard cross years ago that would eat any kind of food. We used to give her stuff just to see what she wouldn't eat. Never happened, she ate it all.  I have a large vegetable garden and when I pull my onions in the fall I spread them out on my picnic table to let them dry for 3-7 days  for better storage. One day I let her out in the backyard to do her business and when I went to let her back in she was on the picnic table devouring my onions. No idea how many she gobbled up. However the next couple of days she had the runs and the most putrid farts you could ever imagine. We had to leave most of the windows in the house cracked open it was that bad."

He'll steal anything he knows he is not supposed to have (tissue paper, empty toilet rolls from the bathroom garbage, pieces of plants that have dropped off.)  Then he stands there to show us and when we try to get it out of his mouth he runs.  He'll only drop it if I offer him a treat (smart dog).  I'm sure that's why he does it.  I did have a cat who used to eat the tinsel off the Christmas tree and as terry said, you have to pull it out of their butt. Fun times"

I've tried to feed her a bland diet in the past to get over various stomach issues and if I don't put anything in there on top of it, the rice will sit there all day.  I don't blame her.  Also, I have pet insurance and its payed off quite well.  Our first year we got over $1500 back from it and we felt like we were well ahead of the game, and this year is her third year and she's going in for surgery tomorrow to get a growth removed from her ear.  (little nervous) Its nice to not have to worry about the cost at all.  I don't know about you, but we definitely don't have a couple thousand dollars kicking around at all times that we don't have any intention/use for."
