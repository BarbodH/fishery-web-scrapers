If you had your choice which lake would you choose and do you know of a good lodge or private cottage to rent?  These lakes are big, we aren't looking for anybody's spots, just general starting locations. For Example: ""South end of lake is best this time of year"" that kind of thing.  PM me if you prefer to keep your opinion private."
961257,Sterling,2016-03-07 13:13:00,477,What do you want to catch?
961274,Joeytier,2016-03-07 14:18:00,3990,I have an option for a great private camp rental on Kipawa (turtle PT/hunters lake area) for a reasonable price.  Water access on a beautiful area of the lake.  PM me if you want contact information for the guy or any other info.

961305,smitty55,2016-03-07 16:17:00,928,I've been to both plenty of times and definitely prefer Kipawa. Stayed in the hub area at Alwaki Lodge the most. The last time at Temagami the OPP were trying to pay for their new boat and were nailing everyone including lodge boats for alcohol out of residence. In Quebec you are legal to have a pint in the boat and they don't bother anyone unless the driver was right hammered.  Cheers
