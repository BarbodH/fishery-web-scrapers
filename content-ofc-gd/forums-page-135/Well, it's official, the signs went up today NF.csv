960940,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-04 00:30:00,8243,That's not good. Plenty to see on Vancouver Island during the winter. Is the motor home off the table now?
960958,Big Cliff,2016-03-04 08:52:00,6899,"That's not good. Plenty to see on Vancouver Island during the winter. Is the motor home off the table now? No, not at all, motor home is still a go but we do want a base as well, something small locally to call home so that when the time comes we can't travel anymore we don't have to start looking all over again."
961029,Beans,2016-03-05 01:21:00,3339,"Well...You are finally making a move (not that I'm happy to hear this but we wish you and Sue all the best. )  The reason we bought this place was because it was a half an hour to Jack and Jackie's place and a half an hour to yours...  I still remember the day you put the dock in and Jack and I manned the BBQ...and the days the three of us put in getting the ""Tin of Beans"" seaworthy...  Yep, I gots lots of memories of you also...how about the fish and chips from ""Just for the Halibut"" the six of us partaked of at our place...  Best of luck my friend...sigh*"
961040,Big Cliff,2016-03-05 11:27:00,6899,"It ain't over Beans, just another step in the getting older LOL. Hey remember all the trips we use to take up to Jack lake and I'd drive out onto the lake so you'd have a comfortable place to sit (I never did tell you that was the reason LOL) or the time we got nailed on Simco on my ATV because we weren't wearing helmits, people were walking faster than we were going. Boy we do have some wonderful memories LOL."
961042,DanD,2016-03-05 13:28:00,2223,"Good luck on your next step in life Cliff, change is always good to refresh your outlook; not that you seem to need refreshing. LOL Look at all your friends here on the board (people you have met or like myself who we haven.t met) that are pulling and caring for you. All the best.  A whole new set of adventures await you  Dan"
961069,davey buoy,2016-03-05 21:05:00,5505,"Cliff all the best to you,I'm turning 55 this mth, I feel good still ,but I do know that day will come.Just with  my fairly short time here ,SIR,I wish one day I can pay something forward like you have many times.Your new beginning in a new place.less maint and so on I can see that.You have it all worked out,that I know. Time to relax..Best to you and your wife ."
961077,woodenboater,2016-03-05 21:51:00,2277,"After I win Lottomax and buy your place, I'll make sure there's a spot for your motor home so you can come and go as you please. You'd probably need a 30amp outlet too  ?  Enjoy life on the road and I trust we'll be seeing reports from all over Canada !"
961079,Loonietoon,2016-03-05 22:38:00,1450,All the best wishes for you and Sue my friend.. that must have been the module l was looking at also ....sweeeeeeet
961094,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-06 02:20:00,8243,"You really should consider one of these 3 season places they have here on Erie Cliff. I saw 1 today going for 45 grand. 2 beds, 1 bath, kitchen and dining room, living room. 900 ftsq. Not a mobile home, a cottage."

961186,Moosebunk,2016-03-07 00:54:00,3970,Beautifully said Cliff.  Best to you with whatever comes next in life.
960739,Big Cliff,2016-03-02 19:21:00,6899,"We have been talking about it for a year or so; we love this place and have enjoyed 15 wonderful years here, so many memories of the kids, grand kids, neices, nephews, friends, swimming, fishing, sitting by the fire.......It sure has been wonderful and the memories will stay with us for the rest of our lives.  We have been so blessed to have the most wonderful friends and family, if it weren't for them this move would have probably happened a few years earlier. Heck I remember one year I posted on here that I needed help putting my docks in: 16 people showed up on the most miserable day you could imagine in April and before they left the docks were in!  I needed to do some landscaping stuff: wiskeywizard (Mike) and manjoe39 (Paul on his holidays) showed up and spent two days here slugging sand and laying interlock. Mike even handed me the key to his tractor because I had about 30 yards of gravel to move. They wouldn't take anything for it, they just did it because that's the kind of people they are.  One year I even posted that we wanted to adopt a son, someone that we could share our good fortune with but that would also help us; enter Shawn and Simon (pikeslayer). Turned out that Shawn would be going to school here in Lindsay and needed a place to stay. Friendships developed, their famly became part of our extended family and is to this day!  Over the years we have met so many wonderful people here and had the pleasure of sharing their company, oh I wish I could list them all but that would take a very long time and I'd probably miss someone and feel really bad about it.  From time to time we tend ""not to remember"" (we don't forget, we just don't remember) until something triggers it and it all floods back. Roy having a nap on our deck, Beans coming back after a fishing trip with Albert and looking like a wet dog, a 7 year old landing a 43"" muskie off our dock on a Spiderman fishng rod..... How do you put 15 years of wonderful into a post like this.  Selling the boat and ATV are going to be hard for me to do as well, both are in excellent condition but with us down sizing I'm just not going to have room for the ATV and my little Rogue just can't tow a boat this size so I'll probably just get myself something that I can still handle. It will all work out!  Anyway, I know there are some real-estate agents on here, if you have the time to look at our listing and offer any advice it would be most welcome. We decided to sell it privately for a couple of reasons but there is a buyers rep incentive available. The property Guys sign # is: 195744  Moving on (but not up just yet)"
960742,huzzsaba,2016-03-02 19:46:00,884,Beautiful house on the lake! Best of luck with the sale and wish you the best in your future ventures!

960744,grt1,2016-03-02 19:49:00,638,"I know exactly where you are coming from. the wife is adamant that we move from our house on the lake (we built it 25 years ago) and have enjoyed the lake life for so long, it is really tough to move away, but we hit the magic age of 70 and it is so much work to take care of the house and property we aren't able to do it and it would need someone younger to do it justice.  So this summer I will get my boys out to help clean out the basement and go thru my stuff and pick out what they want then try and put it on the market.  If this is the golden years, they sure are a crappy colour. sure going to hate moving to an apartment and having neighbours so close, but happy wife, happy life (I guess)"

We have enjoyed the best of the best for the last number of years. Now it is time for us to sit back and let someone else enjoy it while we sit back and enjoy watching them enjoy it! We can still go fishing or whatever but we just have to pace ourselves and let someone else do the work LOL."

960779,manjo39,2016-03-02 21:29:00,354,"Hi Cliff,  when we were looking for a place I was doing some homework and came across your posts of how much you liked it there.  It was one of the reasons why we bought where we did.  It's nice to take a stroll or ride bikes with the boys to come chat, feed chipmunks in your kitchen or go out fishing. Helping you out when you need it is easy when I know you pay it forward many times.  Once the boat is sold, please take me up on my standing offer to come fish anytime."

LOL, you see, memories keep flooding in, the boys feeding the chipmunks I think we have the fattest chipmunks in the whole darn area. I had one that came right in, got up on my computer and generated random key strokes. (well I thought they were random until I realized they all came out ""give me more peanuts or else""). Seriously though you have a beautiful family and I would love to spend more time fishing with you or just hanging out! We won't loose touch!"
960787,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-02 22:00:00,8243,"Cliff I hear something in your voice and it is a bit of sadness. It is one of the biggest decisions in your life to move away from a wonderful home with so many memories. It has to be hard. Mom and Dad had to go into a retirement residence 2 years ago after living in our home for 60 years. It was very hard for them and still haven't adjusted. We reminisce about the ""good old days"", I say these are the good new days. We make today what we will think back on tomorrow. We downsized as far as maintenance 16 years ago. 4500 sq feet for the 2 of us was stupid so we moved to our cottage. They are going to have to take me to the morgue from here. I am only going to be 62 and but mornings like today feel like 92. I have good days when I can cut the grass and paint and tidy and, and. If it's a bad day today, tomorrow it will get done. There will be a day I need to go into a condo or apt. just not today.  You will make the road your home with that new rig you are going to get. You always have a bed to sleep in when you take in the north shore of Erie, or a plug to hook into when you get here. We will go Walleye hunting in my boat, 2 of these Erie monsters will feed the 4 of us with leftovers. Actually we will stay in the motor home and you can have the whole cottage to Sue and yourself, just don't mess with my remote."

Have you ever considered the mobile home route? Mobile home, modular home. To me mobile home means it's still on wheels LOL. We are actually quite interested in a really nice modular in a year round trailer ??? park. It's beautiful, two bedrooms, two bath rooms, open concept, fireplace, a nice little workshop for me to putter in. A driveway just big enough to fit 4 cars (if you park close)..... so yes, we are considering it but there are also several nice little bungalows here in Lindsay."
960931,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-03 22:51:00,8243,"Go and get yourself one of those motor homes you were considering. Are you still in the market? Buy a very nice turn key condo in Hamilton for the 2 of you for less than $230,000.00 or a 6 month very nice 3 season cottage on leased land near me for less than $50,000.00 and a few grand a year lease then travel the highways and byways of North America while you still can. South in November and back home for Easter. Or just buy a condo and a place in Florida, Texas or Arizona, prices are still reasonable even with the dollar. I wish my wife would be open to the motor home route while I can still drive. The day you sell will be the first day of the rest of your life. The opportunities you have are many. I'm envious."
