961307,Joeytier,2016-03-07 16:18:00,3990,"You should see how much the tourism board paid him to write this...  Just kidding (obviously), the big chartreuse jigging rap globbed up with half minnows was the ticket big time."

961418,NAW,2016-03-08 01:29:00,4022,Nice guiding Chad!!
961420,manitoubass2,2016-03-08 01:38:00,11391,"This just in...  Chad and crew are in negotiations with local MNR covering the radical decline of lake nippissing walleyes.  The MNR begged and pleaded for Chad to leave that spot alone.  He refused, yelling ""NIP IS BACK BABY""! Regretably, in speedos in front of local news stations.  Since Chad had done nothing illegal, he small packaged the MNR into a corner that left the aboriginals upset.  LOCAL ABORIGINAL: "" His(Chads) angling technique is depleting our waters. Just two lines and he outfishes our ""square hooks"", its simply not fair"".  More on this breaking story, tonight at 11"
961425,Rod Caster,2016-03-08 02:21:00,5784,"Bahahaha Rick! I'm hoping to at least get a pro staffer offer from Trout Junkie (""Leechman"" made my tipups) out of this news story."
961429,gino,2016-03-08 02:50:00,400,"This was by far the most productive and entertaining ice fishing episode I ever had. Chad and Joey were awesome, had tons of fun with them and the fishing was awesome. Great guys! We will definitely come back for more. Thanks, Chad & Joey!"
961437,manitoubass2,2016-03-08 03:41:00,11391,"BREAKING NEWS!  After our initial report, we received many phone calls, e-mails and sexts with more information regarding ""Chad"" and his raping of Lake Nipigon walleye populations.  We our live early to post many stunning facts!  It turns out, many aboriginals witnessed ""Chad"" was not fishing alone. Many witnesses say he was in a party of 3 to 5. ""Some so white they blinded us, some so red we feared they were sunburnt to death and brought back from the afterlife"" one aboriginal claims.  ""I think they might have cleared the lake of walleye within the 3 times I seen them! Its hard to tell? On a sunny day they blinded you with somekind of whiteness"", says local aboriginal.  More sexts arrived as well, and after a brief bathroom break, we discovered a whole new level of unscrupulous activities.  As it turns out, reports indicate the local aboriginals participated in dances, asking the creator to knock a tree over on ""Chads"" car.  ""It was incredibly successfull say one resident. Adding ""lets see him make use of that tree now""!  Now for a plot twist...  As confirmed by many, it turns out these ""fishing"" individuals belong to a radical, anti city, fishing and hunting cult!  The name given was OFC, thought by many to stand as a cover, meaning ""Ontarios Fried Concessions"".  As our team discovered, it is nothing but a front.  Many members harm fish for pictures by placing hookes in their mouths, among other acts of brutality.  They also gloat at killing and cooking animals, almost so proud it would make Hitler pay the gas bill.  As it turns out, many members indoctrinate their children early. One member even went so far as to name his child ""lil fisher"". With a smile on his face, the child looks terrified to be in OFC.  Another member, known to post many pictures and videos, fled to the bahamas. ""Limeyangler"" as he is known, post many discouraging videos in which he forces his son to cause harm to fish, makes his dog run at fast speeds un the snow, and worst of all, kidnapped his father on numerous occasions to assault fish.  More calls are coming in as we speak and we will keep you updated!  As for now, seems this community is on the lamb, with the owner hiding in some cavernous cabin.  Stay tuned.... or not  Parents, please spay or neuter your children.  From box news, have a hellava night!"
