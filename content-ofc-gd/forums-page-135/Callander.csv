961118,Nipfisher,2016-03-06 16:05:00,2449,My hut is at 20 FOW. Not steady action but lots of bites at prime times.
961201,iFish4real,2016-03-07 02:08:00,386,Thanks!
961207,Rod Caster,2016-03-07 03:03:00,5784,I recommend fishing from 0 to 1 foot. Just be careful not to drive your auger blades into the sand

961685,irishfield,2016-03-09 22:56:00,26272,So much water on the ice and huts being pulled off. Take your hipwaders and spikes!

I had no idea it was so shallow that far from the point I walked on.  Ice was frozen clear to the bottom.  Turned around and went in to a machine shop to have blades sharpened.  Auger cut great for the first 20 or so inches lol."
