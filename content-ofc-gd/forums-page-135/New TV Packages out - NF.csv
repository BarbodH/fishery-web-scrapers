Works pretty good for under $5 a month and saves me having to give bell close to $60 a month. free long distance in Canada too.  http://ca.ooma.com/ Mind you, there was a power outage in Almonte yesterday so I had no internet for a while but we still had wifeys cell phone. I d/l many movies and tv shows so if it wasn't for sports I would drop expressvu as well. Bell has been ripping us off for too long with things like the $4 charge for touch tone service, which they recently hid into their basic charge.  Cheers  Cheers"

Im the son of a TV repairman so I like my electronics and have 5 tvs in the house. A little embarrassing when there is only 4 people"

All kinds of hockey...NHL,AHL,ECHL,European leagues,college hockey...there is app that will give you 9 US networks and a PVR function for FREE in HD I might add...I can watch virtually any movie, documentary or TV series ever made at the push of a button commercial free. You need a box per TV...just like cable..oh and by the way you don`t need a Android box to try the technology you have a computer or a old cell phone kicking around they will run the app...
