I have been trying to get the meegs perfected, but was getting frustrated each time. Today made up for all that frustration.  I got the call there were fish in real shallow. How shallow, 16 fow. Sight fishing. This I had to see. So meet up with Rob and his buddy and off we went.  Walking out there were some holes with battle blood at them. I was getting excited to get fishing.  Set up in 16 fow and it didnt take long to start marking. I lowered the meegs and the spoon. They were chasing the spoon but not hitting. This is were the game changed.  I start bouncing the meegs off the bottom and raise it a few inches and slowing twitch it. WHAM, and I mean WHAM. It smashed the bait. Didnt take long to get it top side being only 16 fow. LOL Managed one more after that on the meegs and back down it went. To soon to call it quits. Then the screen went blank for an hour.  Since it was warming up nice and there was no wind, we put the huts away and moved around abit. 43 fow. Marking right away and KABOOM, another whitie on. Get this one top side and thats my two fish limit. Figured why take the chance on a blank screen again.   After about 5 minutes, Rob nails one on his meegs aswell. I had a few chasers on the swim bait, one hit and miss. Called it a day at noon.  James, I hope I made ya proud bud. I know you were just as frustrated as I ,when I told you I couldnt get them to work for me.  Thanks for the invite Rob. That makes us even on the trade up spots.  Today I can say, I smashed them on the MEEGS.        This pic reminds me of the movie TWINS.      "
