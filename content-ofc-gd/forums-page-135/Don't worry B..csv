It won't be causing problems any more.(Brian has totally been out fishing me these past two weeks, but I'm pretty happy with how I did this winter)  (and by 'dealt with' I mean 'gave a stern talking to before sending back down the hole. Hope she makes lots of babies in the coming years)  Best fight I have ever had with a fish through the ice. She just did not want to come up. Kept bulldogging back towards the bottom every time I got her close. Kept avoiding the hole when I was getting her near the surface. Was a great way to cap off the season."
