No wonder i rarely go there with that nonsense.  _________________ Don't count the day's Make the day's count"

I recall there was always a line up at the electronics counter.  One year, the model advertised wasn't available and they replaced it with a model a tier above for the same price.   It's not likely to happen again, but you never know.   Personally, I'd call again because who knows if you talked to the correct person the first time.    Not that I am defending BPS, but this happens all over these days."
