959980,John,2016-02-27 14:06:00,2956,"The great thing about this forum is that it is what it is. A bunch of like minded guys and gals who not only enjoy sharing a common interest but also have interests outside of the fishing world. Some of us belong to many forums, some strictly fishing where you don't dare post anything other than the catch of the day!. We have debated this topic ad nauseum and the vast majority of members, old and new also like it how it is. Some choose to share more of the non fishing events in their lives some do not. The Admins do a great job of pulling in the reins from time to time when we get out of line, but one of the great things is that we are somewhat self policing.....those that come here to stir the pot for poops and giggles don't last long..  I too have been around almost from the start and don't get on as much as I would like as I am currently working 12-14 hour days building a business.......BUT it's what this community is that keeps me coming back."
960010,Grimace,2016-02-27 17:04:00,2020,"I think to a certain degree this board is a victim of its own success.  Before I got married and had kids I use to fish 100 days a year.  I barely get out compared to what I use to so I don't post like I use to.  My son is at a good age now so he can fish with myself and my father for a day without getting bored.  Back to my original statement about this board being a victim of its own success.  The immense amount of traffic that views this board may make some people nervous of posting.  I took my son out perch fishing a while ago and he caught a 14.5 inch perch.  The bloody thing was huge.  As proud as I was of him, I didn't feel comfortable posting his picture on a board that gets literally thousands of views a day.  I think I could adjust a bit and make sure I grab a picture of him holding his catches without his face in the pic or something.  Maybe that is the short answer."

The minute you post a childs picture and any information about them you are opening up the possibility that some sicko will try to take advantage of them. They have a picture, know they like fishing, know what their fishing clothing looks like and from Dad's profile might already have an idea of a home base. Boy it is so easy to go from there......  As for posting fishing related things; you have to be so careful. I can't tell you how many times I have gotten emails and PMs giving me poop because I shared what someone else thought was their ""secret""! I am very cautious now about what I do post that is fishing related."

960179,Dutch01,2016-02-28 18:14:00,1431,"The notion that ""fishing only"" boards are void of rancor is a fallacy anyways.  I saw a post on another board, a guy and his Son with a pile of perch.  The guy got attacked for being ""over his limit"" (like you can count perch in a pile anyways) and no one even knew how many people were in his fishing party or how many fish in his pile.  I don't think that guy will post another picture anytime soon.  It's the nature of the internet.  Once everyone is too busy fishing again the ratio of fishing to non-fishing posts will turn around,"

Traffic is what advertisers want without it sites are in the N.F.L., not for long. I know a few people that tell me they have been a member of this site for years and have exactly zero posts. They are lurkers that have nothing to contribute, they just want to have someone lead them to the fish. I think there should be a minimum number of posts made to continue their membership.
