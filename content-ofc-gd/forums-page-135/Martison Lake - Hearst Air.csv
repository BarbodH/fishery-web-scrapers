Thanks in Advance.  James  No I haven't fished it, but I have talked to Hearst at length about the lake and have heard great things. I can't believe you wouldn't love it. In fact I'm sure you would.  Two summer's ago I fished Sunshine Lake which is by far their smallest and least popular camp. Sunshine was for years George Veilleux's personal camp and was built for family trips. Then at some point they opened it to the public. I believe Sunshine is probably their worst lake and it's still fantastic. Martison is considerably larger.  Booking that camp would be a very low risk. The ONLY thing about Hearst is all of their outposts are very basic. They're perfectly clean and comfortable, but have coleman lanterns for light, no furniture to speak of, no running water, etc..They're like all outpost camps used to be 25 years ago. I like them myself.  My report on Sunshine:  http://www.canadafishingguide.net/walleyes-gone-wild-a-father-and-son-fly-in-trip-with-hearst-air/"
