960843,shimano19,2016-03-03 04:46:00,196,Wondering where all the musky guys buy there trebles from? Size 3/0 to 8/0. I've looked around local stores and they have a few sizes but not everything I need. Also what brand do you prefer.
960845,mike rousseau,2016-03-03 05:16:00,4661,eBay Rollie and Helens musky shop  Vmc black nickel 4x strong are the best I've used... Unfortunately they only go to 5/0  Hard to find good musky hooks
960847,Roy,2016-03-03 05:44:00,13728,"Yeah, they're not easy to find. I  use quite a lot of 6/0 and  7/0 trebles and the easy ones to find are the Mustad 3551's One of the largest selection of hooks available online are from Captain Hook's at http://www.captainhookswarehouse.com/index.cfm?page=home  I buy my large trebles from Luremaking.com because they are Canadian and have great service.  Good luck."

960852,Gregoire,2016-03-03 11:51:00,1397,"Le Barons has them all the way up to 8/0, and usually at a good price."
960861,Joey,2016-03-03 13:27:00,9122,"Yep, as others have said, LeBaron has them and also you can order them at luremaking.com and they arrive in a day or two."
960868,cram,2016-03-03 14:18:00,1733,"Lebarons.  If you don't see them on the shelf, ask and they will sometimes have in the back...and/or can order for you."
960897,JoshS,2016-03-03 17:26:00,729,JB's usually has them too. I ordered mine from luremaking.com
960924,adempsey,2016-03-03 21:32:00,1498,"Owner are probably my favorite hook brand.  I can't say that I've replaced any hooks on my musky baits though.  They only make one larger treble that I am aware of, the Stinger 68 Trebles.  They aren't cheap.  I read that some guys use the double hooks as well.   Not sure about single hooks, but there would be a lot more options if it worked."
960960,Gregoire,2016-03-04 11:37:00,1397,Doubles are great for crank baits. Quite expensive though.
