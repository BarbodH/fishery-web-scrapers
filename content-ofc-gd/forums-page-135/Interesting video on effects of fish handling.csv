960506,Acountdeleted,2016-03-01 17:58:00,2562,Wow.  can you post the link please? I want to email this on to some people that don't have access to OFC.
960511,manitoubass2,2016-03-01 18:10:00,11391,Holy smoke I never woulda thought!  Id be interested in seeing this with other species and maybe rubber type gloves too or even leather as I always use a leather parm mechanic glove with the index finger cut off for cold weather fishing
960515,Sterling,2016-03-01 18:18:00,477,Wow.  can you post the link please? I want to email this on to some people that don't have access to OFC.  If you hit the youtube icon on the bottom right of the video it takes you to the source;
960517,Acountdeleted,2016-03-01 18:23:00,2562,"Thanks guys. When I do the family fish day event that I was talking about in another post, I want to have this video playing on a loop for the entire event. Good info to get out to the public."
960597,richyb,2016-03-02 00:13:00,774,I wonder what the trout and whitefish in Simcoe look like after a winter. You see reports of guys catching and releasing 20 fish a day and some of them flop around on the ice and freeze or get bear hugged with their snowsuits for a pic.
960599,Steve,2016-03-02 00:22:00,2075,wow.  not sure what to say about that video.  would like to hear a biologists opinion on that one....seems too crazy to believe.
960601,Joeytier,2016-03-02 00:26:00,3990,"I was expecting something scientific, not one time lapse video of one fish being handled.  It looks very plausible, but theres not really much you can take from one brookie developing some rash sitting in a tank."
960613,netminder,2016-03-02 01:26:00,514,"I don't think I've ever heard anyone suggest using cotton gloves like that to handle fish... I thought it was just common knowledge that the ""slime"" on the fish was to protect it and to try to not remove it. Obviously a glove like that is going to absorb it."
960614,Fishwilly,2016-03-02 01:32:00,206,Also I'm sure the fish's immune system must be compromised from being stressed in that environment. I'm sure that's not helping.
960615,manitoubass2,2016-03-02 01:41:00,11391,Great questions!
960624,NANUK,2016-03-02 02:23:00,797,"Also I'm sure the fish's immune system must be compromised from being stressed in that environment. I'm sure that's not helping.  Exactly, releasing it in a bath tub like environment with no natural habitat and food is very stressful and can't be good for its immune system."
960626,chris.brock,2016-03-02 02:32:00,4053,"It looks like some bruising too because the guy squeezed the hell out of it. I've never found the need to use a glove on any species.  Cheesy video, bad science, but a good message."
960630,Gallie,2016-03-02 02:52:00,1215,"I agree that you cant make conclusions based on one fish but i think most of us know that fish slime is a critical part of a fishes makeup, i ve never used a handling glove myself but if you do i thought most people would wet a proper rubber glove not use your work glove. The less you handle any fish the better off its going to be, i dont think you need video proof to know that."

960634,manitoubass2,2016-03-02 03:00:00,11391," Obviously this is ""scientifically flawed"", but it is interesting nonetheless"
960635,Gallie,2016-03-02 03:05:00,1215,"I agree, some people will do what they want regardless. I think anyone who cares already does what they can, those who dont arent likely to change for any number of reasons."
960636,chris.brock,2016-03-02 03:08:00,4053,"Hey Gallie, while you're on here, is that you and a buddy in a picture with a good muskie  at the Minden CT?"
960683,Gallie,2016-03-02 14:44:00,1215,"Lol chris i have no idea, unless it came from the guy at kashaga lodge i sure didnt put it there. I dont even have one at my ct but maybe i should bring one in ?"
960896,JoshS,2016-03-03 17:22:00,729,"Yeah the science behind the video is sketchy. It could very well be accurate though. Lots of variables need to be explored -maybe it's the cotton, the environment, the brooktrout, etc. But the video's message stays the same. I've seen way too many poor releases where you know the fish is toast."
960900,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-03 18:05:00,8243,"Very interesting video, thank you for taking the time to post.  Jeremy when you do your talk with the kids spend time talking about the proper way to handle a fish. I have found kids may love to catch them then freak a bit when they have to handle them."

961046,4x4bassin,2016-03-05 16:09:00,1025,"Interesting video , I think there is more to this video then what your seeing . A lot of different factors could come into play here but who knows. Now there is no doubt proper catch and release habits are good for the fish and gives it a better chance of survival but I know from first hand knowledge that trout are a little more resilient then what you may think . A group of us have caught the same lake trout 5 years in a row and at least a couple times that fish has accidently been dropped and mishandled in the bottom of the boat and it still keeps coming back to fight another day . Now I am in no way condoning bad fish handling habits but some times a jacked up lake trout finds the bottom of the boat , it happens . But what I am saying is give the fish a chance , you just never know ."
