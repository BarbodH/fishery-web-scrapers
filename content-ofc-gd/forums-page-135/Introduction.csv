961809,AKRISONER,2016-03-10 20:06:00,5558,"Hahaha its funny because its usually true.  "" ill listen to anything but country or rap""     this usually translates to ""my taste in music sucks"""
961813,Brucki,2016-03-10 20:46:00,6,"hahah, love classic rock... old school rap. Some house music (im 23),,,,, cant stand country,"
961815,wormdunker,2016-03-10 20:55:00,1711,Hey watch your comments about country music!!  LOL!
961816,Dutch01,2016-03-10 20:58:00,1431,I'm 44 and can't stand country - it doesn't sound any better as you get older!
961818,Acountdeleted,2016-03-10 21:05:00,2562,"With the occasional Emminem Big and Rich for country, some Willie Nelson, Miranda Lambert (I could go on), oh and whatever hootie and the blowfish guy is calling himself now."
961819,jimmer,2016-03-10 21:05:00,2730,Good luck on the open water! Welcome.

961825,netminder,2016-03-10 21:24:00,514,"Welcome to the board. If I was in your boat I don't think I'd end up teaching you anything about fishing, but I'd have plenty to tell you regardless."
961827,Dutch01,2016-03-10 21:31:00,1431,"I'll take some of that over here - most of the ""new rap"" I've heard is crap. They don't make it like they used to.  Maybe you can turn me on to something good made after the 90's......"
961829,manitoubass2,2016-03-10 21:41:00,11391, Although from akrisoner I learned Run the Jewelz is pretty solid? (features el-p from Company Flow)  Also Hopsin has a few good songs too

961985,Acountdeleted,2016-03-11 16:53:00,2562,"I told you, I like everything, just don't want to hijack the thread (too late)  DMX, Run DMC, Public Enemy, Flava Flav, Busta Rhymes, Sticky Fingaz...... How old school are we going?"

Maybe you can turn me on to something good made after the 90's......  +1 to Run the Jewels...you will like it i can pretty much guarantee it.  Also please do not discount Section 80 by Kendrick Lamar...listen to his lyrics you might think hes a gangster rapper...but boy oh boy he is anything but...hes a god loving observationalist that speaks to the decline of african american society and society in general due to the forces of peer pressure, racism, social media and substance abuse...incredible."
961656,Brucki,2016-03-09 21:11:00,6,"Hey Guys,  New to the board, just wanted to introduce myself.  Brief description of myself.... I am only 23 but have been fishing my whole life. my dad got me into the sport while i was really young. I have two passions, hockey and fishing.  I recently just purchased a 16 ft legend with a 4 stroke 40 hp Honda, and am looking to explore some new waters this year. In the past, i have spent a lot of time fishing for pike, bass and pickerel in the summer months, while spending time in the fall hunting salmon on the credit.  With this gorgeous weather. I am heading out to the Niagara Bar Saturday, i will post a report upon my return (assuming i have some success)   Cheers,"
