961349,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-07 20:35:00,8243,"Around 9:15 last evening TV programming was interrupted for an Amber Alert. A good Samaritan called 911 when they saw what appeared to be a child forced into a vehicle in Orillia. It turned out that it was the kids parents bringing the child home and the kid was running away. It came on about 4 more times until the alert was cancelled. I have never seen this here. It automatically took you to a different channel. I like that proactive policing, no more call back in 24 hours and we will start looking.  Believe it or not 911 and providers received calls from people complaining it was interrupting their TV program or locking their TV's!!!!! Man people never cease to amaze me."
961352,Dara,2016-03-07 20:39:00,3052,I was watching a recorded show and it interrupted that too...just glad the kid was ok
961353,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-07 20:40:00,8243,Mods you can delete this thread please. N.A.W. posted the same subject a few minutes before I did.
961365,Sinker,2016-03-07 21:17:00,8692,Same here. I was surprised it could interrupt a recording like that. Pretty cool if you ask me.  S.
961370,manitoubass2,2016-03-07 21:23:00,11391,I think they can even do it over smartphones too

I must be a member of the tinfoil hat club , but them having the ability to interrupt a recorded program  is over the line . What is it ? a smart TV and part of your internet network, the recorded program maybe on a PVR Hard drive , I'm not understanding how this worked."
961412,lookinforwalleye,2016-03-08 00:25:00,4399,The are watching....all the time
961413,dave524,2016-03-08 00:29:00,4508,"The are watching....all the time  http://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/02/09/samsung-tv-privacy/  well, listening anyway    got masking tape over the camera lens on this here laptop"
961422,KraTToR,2016-03-08 01:58:00,506,Worth the slight inconvenience for sure!  Finally something is working..
961423,Woodsman,2016-03-08 02:07:00,1286,Didn't happen here. Maybe a small cable company is the reason? Many at work today mentioned it happening to them.
961426,Dara,2016-03-08 02:31:00,3052,I got one a couple weeks ago over my iphone when I was snowmobiling in michigan
961430,Sinker,2016-03-08 03:09:00,8692,I dont know how it worked either. I was watching a show i had recorded on the pvr. It shut it right down.
961433,irishfield,2016-03-08 03:17:00,26272,"Bell Xpressview. We were watching PVR and it dumped to amber alert with the full page red. Tonight watching the PVR again, from stuff recorded yesterday, it was just a ticker tape across the picture."
961436,grizzlybri,2016-03-08 03:35:00,565,"yup I got it watching the walking dead last night, I'm with bell fibe, a window popped up with the alert but i had the option to escape out of it once all the information scrolled across the screen"
961456,Terry,2016-03-08 10:05:00,14456,our Bell Xpressview. jumped to another channel
961465,dave524,2016-03-08 12:57:00,4508,"We have Fibe , but I wasn't paying attention , but I didn't hear anything from my wife so  I'm guessing it was a non event here. Still , interrupting a PVR recording is puzzling."
