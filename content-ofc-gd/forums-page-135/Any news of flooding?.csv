961715,captpierre,2016-03-10 04:01:00,2521,Lost all our snow here in York Region over last few days. Has to be similar elsewhere. Lake levels have to rising  fast. Any flooding?
961721,Tom McCutcheon,2016-03-10 04:40:00,627,Nothing yet on Pigeon Capt. (I assume that is what your looking for).  Although the ice is fading fast.
961723,Sinker,2016-03-10 05:22:00,8692,There is not enough snow to flood anything!
961726,OhioFisherman,2016-03-10 05:34:00,6623,"There is not enough snow to flood anything! LOL, same here, i don't think we got 12 inches of snow total all winter, most of it came down as rain! My son said most of the area ponds never got much more than sheet ice on them and it's all gone.  It was like 70 degrees here today? When i let my dog out this morning all I heard was birds singing!"
961729,manitoubass2,2016-03-10 06:12:00,11391,"Same here. Maybe 2 feet of snow collectively all winter.  Got a warm spell and maybe 2"" on the ground.  Gonna be low water levels here this year in NW ontario"
961742,Big Cliff,2016-03-10 12:10:00,6899,"No flooding on Sturgeon Lake and looking at the forecast for the next two weeks, I don't expect there will be any. Ice conditions; well there is still some fool out in the middle of the lake with a portable hut and he has been there the last two days, I'm not brave enough to take a walk out there to see how he is doing."
961746,dave524,2016-03-10 12:26:00,4508,"Less ice to jam at river mouths, that is a big problem on the Grand. Ice boom came out a couple of days ago at Fort Erie, that is way early."
961747,Raf,2016-03-10 12:35:00,3495,the upper grand was close to breaching up here yesterday but i dont think she will.
961807,irishfield,2016-03-10 19:50:00,26272,"5 feet of snow in Temagami when we left on Sunday, should make things interesting on the Montreal, Temagami and Sturgeon rivers."
961810,Terry,2016-03-10 20:06:00,14456,most ground did not freeze so the water can go into the ground rather then running across the ground to the rivers and lakes
961823,glen,2016-03-10 21:22:00,2641,This global warmng is great.  Snows all gone and so is the water.  I'm running my bbq all the time. Maybe it will warm up enough so I don't get snow at all.
961824,Fisherman,2016-03-10 21:22:00,7201,Nottawasaga and Pine rivers are right up there but as long as any rain holds off all should be ok.
961826,davey buoy,2016-03-10 21:25:00,5505,Could be a Georgian  Bay  Sat.The flooding here should be no where near as say last year.
961830,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-10 22:23:00,8243,Flood warning for the Grand here. We are supposed to get quite a bit of rain but without the ice dams that cause the Grand to flood lowlands I can't see the problem. I remember a few years back Dunnville had so much flooding because of the mouth of the river dammed up with ice that the old cemetery was under 4 feet of water.
