961490,ehg,2016-03-08 18:24:00,2666,"I remember last summer. I had a couple of unbelievable consecutive bass days. After calling around to other friends and reading various reports, I soon realized that that was the time to be out. All the big fish were biting on many different bodies of water. Now I just need to get my crystal ball up and running. Had a place on North Pigeon Lake for 30 yrs.and fished all the time. Noticed that before a cold front fishing was hot. Also noticed that lunar phases had much to do with the bite. Followed these Joe Bucher lunar tables and found them to be true. http://www.muskyhunter.com/moon-secrets/ 2-3 days before /after full moon during day. Full moon scared them of at night."

The cold front pre-fish is definitely a tried and tested pattern for me as well. Especially if you are fishing before a summer electrical storm, the bite will always be insane."
961541,Consigliere,2016-03-09 01:10:00,121,You guys should read Buck Perrys book Spoonplugging. It will explain in detail all the weather stuff you are noticing. So many things will make sense after reading it. It also explains exactly what was experienced -everyone in an area experiencing good fishing. It is a great read and I learned more from that book than anything else. The fishing procedures outlined are very difficult to follow but also very productive. Those are not for everyone but the weather and water conditions will be informative.

961589,AKRISONER,2016-03-09 14:00:00,5558,"This, I find it so accurate I can dictate how far away the storm is lol  usually im sitting out there thinking...ok it takes me 10-15 to get home...how long until the storm is 10-15 away so that I can arrive on my dock and run to the house as the rain starts falling lol.  Last year on buckhorn I said ""Lets go!!!!"" and Dave said ""one more cast"" that one more cast ended up with us being caught in torrential downpour in a golf cart as we drove it back up to his trailer from the docks lol  boy did we catch a lot of bass though"
961592,manitoubass2,2016-03-09 14:11:00,11391,Lol  Ive got the timing down pretty good especially if lightening is involved.  When you can feel it in your rod go as fast as possible lol.
960570,AKRISONER,2016-03-01 21:37:00,5558,"This thread might be short lived...it may be long, but i can honestly say something clearly was going on in Southern Ontario this past weekend.  The amount of reports I am seeing pop up with solid results is perhaps the highest I have ever seen on this forum...  I was lucky enough to be out on GB and we absolutely hammered em too  we even wet a line for 3 hours on Sunday and went 6-7 while losing a 20+lb pike while trying to get it through an 8 inch hole...yikes!  Anyone else here not posting full blown reports but that had success this past weekend? Holy cow."
960578,porkpie,2016-03-01 22:57:00,2521,"I don't do reports, but we smashed steelhead yesterday.  And we didn't even get out until noon.  Hope that helps."
960580,Moosebunk,2016-03-01 22:58:00,3970,"Not this past weekend but last week.  Overall the reports for Eastern Ontario this season have been few, likely due to ice or the perception that ice may be bad.  But before last weekend I was out for my first two days of this ice fishing season and the first was OK for lakers, the second was great whitey fishing.  This Sunday, meh!  And Monday, blah!"
960581,misfish,2016-03-01 23:02:00,29133,"My best weekend was this past one. The first two weekends of the first ice were great as well.   After this weekend, it,s back to the rivers. Take my ice when I can."

We just realized today that all of the small pickerel we were catching were actually sauger! sweeeettt"
960783,BillM,2016-03-02 21:39:00,17367,Sauger in Gbay?  Small walleyes will have big spots and look almost identical to their cousins
960789,AKRISONER,2016-03-02 22:03:00,5558,you tell me...looks pretty saugerish to me! But i know pretty much nothing about sauger except they dont have the white tip on the tail and they have blotches like this fish.

But i know pretty much nothing about sauger except they dont have the white tip on the tail and they have blotches like this fish.     Looks like a Sauger to me.   Also people only post reports when they catch fish. I'll start posting more when I get skunked to even things out.  Last weekend I'm told was good. I watch Brian catch a lot of fish and lucked into a few. Actually this whole winter has been pretty good to be honest. I figure with the warm temps the fish have had a lot less pressure on them.

961023,aplumma,2016-03-05 00:20:00,6896,So if a pickerel is a walleye what is a sauger?  Art
961025,Roy,2016-03-05 00:35:00,13728,A sauger is a malnourished zander in gaudy attire.

Roy im not taking away from your statement, i hope you agree because you have caught sauger yourself many times! I am just looking to fully confirm this."
961298,manitoubass2,2016-03-07 15:29:00,11391,"Ive caught bajillions of them  Its a sauger, young one by the looks of it. The patterns are more defined in the 14"" monsters lol.  They dont get very big. I think the biggest ive caught wasnt quite 17""  No different tasting than walleye though  Just remember sauger and saugeye go against your walleye limit?"
961317,Roy,2016-03-07 17:06:00,13728,"Aside from the characteristic white tail tip etc... of the walleye, you'll also notice if you look at a few pictures that the walleye also has a dark splotch (is that a word?) at the back base of the first dorsal fin. Saugers don't have that ""splotch"". Also, you could probably never see the colour of your hand through the dorsal fins of a walleye. Then there are the random black marks on the sauger's body where the walleye's marks are usually more uniform. On the river here, there is a good mix of both but if you get into a patch of saugers, the walleye will be fewer and farther between. In areas like these, where saugers and walleye co-exist, you're likely to also run into the occasional saugeye as well but that's a horse of a different colour."
961324,AKRISONER,2016-03-07 17:59:00,5558,we were definitely catching both...the saugers seemed to be co-existing with the big walleyes no problem. They were hanging around and following us up and down all day and then every so often a big walleye would show up and eat.
