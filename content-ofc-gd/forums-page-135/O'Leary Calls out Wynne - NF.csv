961712,Canuck,2016-03-10 03:30:00,491,"Another example of how bad increasing capital gains rates is.  So you saved and saved and bought yourself that place on the West Arm back in the 80's or 90's.  Paid $100,000 for it.  Now its worth $400,000.  Nice investment.   Naw, Trudeau has decided that you are now too well off.  You need to share your little windfall with him and Kathleen when you sell it or pass it on to your kids.  So lets say you are in lower tax bracket at say 30% tax rate.  Here is the math:  Capital gains tax on the camp using todays rates  $300K gain x 50% included in income X 30% tax rate = $45,000 tax. If they raise the capital gains inclusion rate to 75% -- $300K x 75% X 30% = $67,500 in tax.  So that is $22,500 more you are going to have to pay in tax if he raises the inclusion rate on capital gains.   Oh, and don't forget, some of the ""gain"" is actually just price inflation, not true ""income"". CPI in 1990 was 78.4, 2015 it is `126.6.  So the $100K in 1990 is worth about $162K today.  So $62K is not a real economic gain, but you are taxed on it.  Still like that paltry $500 savings on your 2016 tax return?  Trust me, we are all paying VASTLY more in tax with a Liberal Federal and Provincial government.  VASTLY more.  Just wait and see."

In my opinion, it is unlikely that the entire 18% voted unanimously for Trudeau, so I believe it is fair to say that he received less than 18% of his votes from people based solely on his legalization promise.  The thing to keep in mind is that the 18% is of total Canadian adults represents far more than 18% of Trudeau's supporters.  If the 18% of adults who had smoked marijuana in the last year had voted for Trudeau, that would represent about 67% of his voters.  Approximately 68% of eligiable voters cast a ballot in the election.  Of those, about 39.5% voted Liberal.  So, about 27% of Canadian adults voted Liberal (39.5% of 68% = 26.9%) in the election.  If 100% of pot smoking adults voted Liberal that would represent (18%/27%=67%) of his votes.  I agree that it is unlikely that they all voted Liberal; it is unlikely that they all voted period.  But even if half of them voted Liberal, that would be a full third of the votes that he received.  It is pretty save to say that at least one third of his supporter were marijauna users.  However, there is really no way to calculate how many of them actually based their decision to vote Liberal based on his promise to legalize marijauna.  If one quarter of those 18% voted Liberal because of his promise, that would represent 6.6% of the voters which would drop his support from 39.5% to 32.9%.  If the Conservatives picked up 50% of those votes then the Conservatives would have won in the popular vote 35.2% to 32.9% which would have resulted in a Conservative minority.  This is all speculation, but I think that promise may have swayed the results.  He may have also picked up support from non-users who support legalization.  There are some of those; myself included."

960622,Dutch01,2016-03-02 02:16:00,1431,"  ""If 100% of pot smoking adults voted Liberal""  I do not believe that this is what occurred. I know many people who partake and no two are alike. Different personalities, political agendas, etc.  ""Marijuana users"" is not a homogenous group.  That 18% of Canadians used marijuana last year does not mean they all vote, or even that they all want legalization. Some of that 18% will also be drug sellers who may prefer the status quo.  In my opinion, it garnered him some votes. I don't think it was what put him over the top. I think to believe so misses what really put him over the top. He made a conscious commitment to positivity and he sold his message well. Harper was perceived to be negative, and his attack ads supported that perception. Those attack ads also backfired. They used out of context sound bites  to paint him in a bad light and said he's just not ready. But at the first debate, which I consider to be a turning point, Trudeau came off as polished and confident. He didn't resemble the guy the Conservatives tried to portray. And he sold a message of hope to a large constituency who wanted anyone but Harper, who were desperate for someone to rally behind.  The resounding message in the media, editorials and that I encountered on the street after Trudeau's win was one of renewed optimism. I think it was a masterful job of framing the narrative by Trudeau and his campaign. That is what I think put him over the top."

Full disclosure: I voted PC provincially and Liberal federally in the last election, in the interest of transparency.  There is a math error in your source data.  $29 billion in 82/83 dollars does not translate into $28.88 billion in 2011 dollars.  This adds ~$40 to Trudeau's final term (by averaging the conversion rates for the years before and after I estimate that the 2011 equivalent is $70.38 billion for 82/83).  I also think there are issues with the allocation of the deficits.  Here is a quote from the site: ""Select a prime minister's name to highlight figures from his time in office. John Turner and Kim Campbell each served for less than one fiscal year; data for their tenures is included as part of their predecessors' terms.""  Joe Clark was also Prime for less than a fiscal year and did not pass a budget.  The deficit that has been assigned to him should be assigned to Trudeau.  I also think they have misallocated deficits for years in which a Prime Minister started in the middle of a fical year.  They have assigned the deficits to the incoming Prime Minister; in my opinion it should be assigned to the outgoing Prime Minister because that's who would have passed the budget for the year.  Based on this logic $77.88 billion of Mulroney's dept should be assigned to Trudeau; and $56.60 billion of Chretien's debt should be assigned to Mulroney.  The revised figures would be:  Trudeau:   $415.38 billion Mulroney:  $443.52 billion Chretein:   $51.38 billion  At first glance Mulroney looks pretty bad; but if interest on inherited debt was removed, I think he would look much better than Trudeau."
960563,netminder,2016-03-01 21:17:00,514,"Only thing I can say is the best time to spend is while in a recession. If past history repeats the economy WILL rebound. If someone suggested running up a deficit while the economy was booming they'd be in for an awful surprise, which is what I think happened here in Ontario. As quickly as things can look up they'll end up going the other way. Even an entry level economist can make numbers dance to whatever drum they feel. If TD wants to tell us we're heading for collapse they'll have one of their economists tell us we're headed for collapse. If a bank wants it's people to spend money they'll put out a report that everything is peachy and everyone should spend like drunken sailors.

960465,Dara,2016-03-01 14:08:00,3052,"Actually there was a viable alternative. Its just that Hudak scared everybody by saying he was going to eliminate 100,000 govt jobs and everybody freaked. Nobody heard the part where he said it would be done by attrition, not layoffs. If a couple voters would actually listen and think we wouldn't have what we have today.  I remember back in the 80's when Joe Clark got a minority govt, brought out a budget. To fill my truck went from $17.00 one day to $24.00 the next. The Liberals freaked and voted against it and called an election. They wan and gas went back to $17.00 a tank, 6 months later I was paying $26.00 a tank.  Thay are sneaky.  MdGuinty wanted to save the planet single handed so he got his green energy program. No care for if we want it or what it costs, he is dead set on saving the planet. Cept, we are paying and the rest of the world isn't on board. Now Kathleen is carrying his legacy...no care for the cost. Steel mill closing is a good thing to here because it saves the planet.  If the rest of the world was on board, great, but we will be done in by it. We have done enough, let the rest catch up now. We will not save the planet on our own and setting an example anymore will break us..."

Human nature dictates that's the population is all for cutting spending as long as doesn't affect their lifestyle.  As a result we as a population will never elect anyone who tackles the deficits & debt head on.  It's far more palatable to just line up at the trough for our 'free stuff' hoping someone else foots the bill and pretending that everything is hunky dory.  It's kind of reminiscent of how the people of Greece have handled their debt crisis.

All had a similar message: Their businesses were feeling the pain of a bad economy.  A light went on in my head at about 2 oclock in the afternoon: This is worse than I thought, Mr. Flaherty recalls. When the second day of meetings wrapped up, he placed a call to Prime Minister Stephen Harper.  You know, we hoped we could run a deficit of fifteen or twenty billion dollars and manage the problem at that level. But I dont think so,  Mr. Flaherty says he told the Prime Minister.  Its deeper and darker and its at all levels of business.  Thats how Mr. Flaherty, a conservative whod risen to political prominence in Ontario as a member of the cost-cutting Mike Harris government, ended up delivering one of the largest deficits in modern Canadian history. The red ink for the fiscal year 2009-10 was nearly $56-billion. When adjusted for inflation, it was on par with the federal deficits of the early 1990s, when Canada was considered a financial basket case.  And Im glad we did, Mr. Flaherty says.""

Congratulations, you two are now managing the largest hedge fund in Ontario’s history! I’m just as optimistic as you are. But I recently made a promise to every taxpayer in Canada that I would call out mediocrity, incompetence and risk in government economic and fiscal policy, so I feel the need to verify a few things: * This new slush fund will have its own independent and transparent account, right? * I will need a quarterly statement of fund flows in and out of the account documenting the source and use of proceeds. After all, someone in your government might forget that this money was earmarked to reduce carbon emissions and spend it on something else. * I expect to be informed on administrative head count. Rumour has it you're planning on hiring hundreds of new government employees to administer the fund. You know how snippety some people can get when you swell government payroll when no one else can find a job in this economy! * I heard Mr. Sousa say on the radio that you're going to be making new and exciting investments in “green tech”. I will need to know the terms of each deal, what I paid for my equity or debt positions, my voting rights and what governance is in place in each investment. * I expect you’ll be hiring an independent auditing firm to value each investment on a mark to market basis and provide a going concern letter in cases where investments might not have worked out as planned. Also “green tech” companies have a nasty habit of going bankrupt as soon as their government subsidies end, but with your and Mr. Sousa’s long track record of picking winners in this industry, I’m not worried about that. * I’d like you to offer some consolation to parents in Ontario who are concerned they're leaving their children a $308 billion debt. Such worry warts! Yes, our $308 billion debt makes Ontario the most leveraged jurisdiction in North America. We now have twice the debt of the state of California with half the population! * Oh yes, just one more thing. You promised that this initiative was going to reduce carbon emissions, so I will need the reduction data on a quarterly basis as well. I know your critics say you could have left all this money in the hands of companies that employ thousands of Ontario workers and in the pockets of entrepreneurs who create new jobs in Ontario, but you told us you could do a better job with it and you didn’t give us a choice anyway. We're already one of the most uncompetitive and highest taxed jurisdictions in North America, so who cares about a few more billion in taxes? Well, maybe some taxpayers did care. They were some of the 29,000 Ontario residents that were affected by your last 2% super tax on Ontario’s high earners. I know they were very concerned about air quality too. Many moved to Nassau where carbon emissions are low. They don’t pay tax in Ontario any more so let’s forget about them. They're not going to give us any more trouble or tax revenue. On behalf of myself and all the Ontario taxpayers who still live here, I want to know that you're our leader on this fund. Before you know it, there's going to be another election in Ontario and I’m going to make damn sure both of you get all the credit you deserve on this. Oh, and good luck with the funds performance. No one else on earth has ever reduced emissions or made money doing this, so I’ll be watching and keeping everybody informed with all the good news that is sure to be coming. And, of course, we will all be breathing easier watching those carbon emissions plunge as soon as you start spending this money! Yours respectfully, Kevin O’Leary @kevinolearytv"
