If you were closer (or feel like a drive) to London; I'd sling it off one of my hoists. I guess I should ask how big/heavy the boat is first? The hoist that I would need use to sling a boat, has a 10K lbs limit. There's a Flying J just a couple of minutes drive from the shop and they have weight scales.  Dan."
