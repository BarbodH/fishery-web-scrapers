The good news is that it's full (which I understand to be better than partially empty); I'm looking for suggestions so as not to end up running gunk into my motor. I was planning on draining it and rinsing with stabilizer.  Any advice would be great.

If it's going to sit for the winter, just leave the tank empty and fill it up in the spring. You should be able to remove all the gas I would think so the stabilizer rinse might not be necessary. If any is left a splash of stabilizer in the tank won't hurt."
