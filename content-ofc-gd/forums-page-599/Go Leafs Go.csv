530500,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-21 04:27:00,0," What is there to say? The leafs are pretty much out of the playoff run unless they go on a longggg winning streak. Its funny, they are a good team but only wake up when they are wayyyy behind. We are always down 2to 3 goals after the first. Then we play catch up Hockey.The leafs didn't even leave their endzone till after the first 5 minutes of the game. By then it was 2-0. THEN we out shot them.  We almost came back 5-3 and two nice feeds by Kessel to almost make it 5-4. Too little too late.  13 times we had not scored in the first two periods, and 6 times I think we were shutout. No wonder our goalies have no confidence. We have no stay at home defense men except Beauchenin, we don't block shots like every other team, we dont move people away from infront of the net.....   Oh well, they should be better next year. We need to aquire another goal scorer to make another line. I still say that the third line should be Armstong, Kadri and Caputi.  Anyways, time to take my leave of abscence. I have left all the appropriate PM's to a few people, so I am done here. Maybe I will come back at playoff time."
530544,lunkerbasshunter,2010-12-21 13:41:00,2585,im so frustrated with the leafs I dont even through stuff at the tv anymore when the other teams score

528663,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-15 04:48:00,0," Who said anything about a dynasty?  We are two players away from a great team. I know why you Montreal fans are talking trash about the leaf fans planning the parade route.None of us ever said we would win the cup, but Montreal? They win one play off game and they were in the streets like they had just won the world cup.LOL  I can't wait to see Price fall apart in the playoffs!!!!  Oh by the way? Did you watch the game tonight? Leafs dominated in every way. Orr with the unanimous decision. Gabrovski the hottest player on the ice(should have been #1 star). Guigere played a great game and is building some confidence(should have been 2nd star). They were streaking to the net and everything.  Did you notice they were cheering go leafs go in Edmonton? Does Montreal get that same respect? Lets face it. Win or lose, Toronto is Canada's team and you know it!  Go leafs go!!!!!"
528669,ctranter,2010-12-15 05:05:00,543,  LOL please give a team to Hamilton...  That's our second team.  There's a reason that Toronto produces more hockey superstars than any other city on the planet.
528670,ctranter,2010-12-15 05:07:00,543,"  Haha good point, they play like a bunch of Europeans anyway... dive much?"
528673,bow slayer,2010-12-15 05:20:00,1074,"  actually  I will help you with facts  ,as someone who is very informed on AAA hockey in ontario including the GTHL Toronto produces very few hockey superstars,most of the stars are from smaller centres surrounding toronto. Yes they play on teams based in Toronto such as marlies,red wings,jr.habs and young nats but very few are from  toronto."
528727,addy79,2010-12-15 14:56:00,573,"gotta say it again, Versteeg played a great game. maybe im biased because hes my sleeper pick in all my pools! He seems to be most comfortable playing deeper lines, but man, he tears it up on the PP!! Not sure why Wilson doesnt put him n kessel on the same line more often...  I know its not so easy with the cap, but we should trade kabbie for Brad Richards  im just sayin..."
528728,addy79,2010-12-15 14:58:00,573,"Red wings all the way!! Tony Lima was my best coach, EVERRRRRR"
528776,Mike Pike,2010-12-15 16:43:00,1332,And I'M thinking a good portion of Habs fans weren't even born since the Habs were a dynasty!  lol
528784,tb4me,2010-12-15 17:01:00,3295,"Go Leafs Go!! I for one love these threads! Simple if you dont like them dont read them. Like Ma used to say If you dont have anything nice to say , dont say anything at all!!...Unless your bashing a habs fan anyway...lol On another note Edmonton Sucks big time. They made the Leafs look like allstars lastnight. Thurs night we play the slumping flames. Puck drop at 9:30    Go leafs Go we need all 6 points on this road trip this week!!"
528925,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-16 01:14:00,0, We should definitely look at getting Brad Richards. That would give us 2 solid lines.  Versteeg has been on the top line with Kessel for a while.  Versteeg has been playing great hockey.
528940,Rod Caster,2010-12-16 01:48:00,5784,  Dallas could probably score the whole Marlies team if they present the trade to Burke with a good powerpoint slideshow loaded with strong fonts and cascading words.
528942,Cookslav,2010-12-16 01:56:00,1457,
529043,jediangler,2010-12-16 12:41:00,1923,"Richards wants to win, why would he come to Toronto?  What could Burke offer Dallas as compensation? Maybe 1st rounders in 2012,13 & 14. He'll be in NYC next year even if he does waive his no-trade by the deadline and move to another team for the rest of the season."
529069,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-16 13:46:00,0, Simply because Toronto is the best place in the world to play hockey. The hockey players are treated like big time celebrities here.  They say he is headed for the Rangers. Too bad Kaberle has the no trade clause...
529073,anders,2010-12-16 13:52:00,1168,"unless your a goalie...your treated like a mule...even if you break the records for wins in a season for your team, or if you are any d man getting paid over 3 million..."
529102,addy79,2010-12-16 14:42:00,573, and isnt he a toronto boy??
529427,bow slayer,2010-12-17 12:40:00,1074,  richards is from PEI
529429,bow slayer,2010-12-17 12:48:00,1074,"  with the media scrunity and pressure, plus demanding fans who will turn on you (mcabe,toskla,raycroft,hoglund....)constant hounding from fans who will stalk you(ask Gilmour) and little privacy  I dont't know why anybody would want to play in Toronto or Montreal when you could play in say New York with little attention.Wilson and Burke look like they have aged 10 years since being there."
529581,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-17 19:52:00,0," Yep. Lebda made a few errors. He's got skill, he's aggressive, but he makes a lot of errors(He acts before he thinks). Only time will tell if experience wises him up. Until then, we might need to bench him.... I honestly though Guigere was gonna finally steal a win. He got lucky with one hitting the crossbar and Gabrovski stopping the other, and he made a GREAT save, going post to post and was playing exceptional.  Then they scored 3 goals in 57 seconds.... Wilson did good taking him out. Our goalies right now are really low in confidence.  Tim brent gave away the puck for the second goal and I wasn't too impressed with Phaneuf's play. I like his one timer, but he should have the goalie more centered. He shoots from too deep.  I was expecting Kessel to score because he does well against Canadian teams but I guess not this time. I also noticed that teams that score first win 80-90% of the time. But unfortunately we were the 10-20% last night....  Is it me or are these new sticks breaking more then the old ones? Lots of sticks exploding these days.  Oh well. The better team won. They outplayed us. Anyways we should beat Vancouver."
529593,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-17 20:23:00,0,Oh and we should keep Bozak on the front line with Kessel and Versteeg. Move Armstrong with Kadri and bring in Caputi. And we will have a solid team.  Make sure Sjostrom is on the 4th line(and brown when he comes back) The rest are expendable.
529752,lookinforwalleye,2010-12-18 04:25:00,4399, Vancouver has been pretty hot lately they will be tough.
529777,solopaddler,2010-12-18 10:06:00,8605," They couldn't beat a crappy team like Calgary, how do you figure they ""should"" beat Vancouver?"
529881,ctranter,2010-12-18 18:19:00,543," The last time they played, the leafs dominated the first and second periods, but blew it in the third.  That game actually stands out as one of the best games that the leafs have played this season.  The score of that one wasn't the game story, outplaying a powerhouse team like the canucks, was.  go leafs go"
530038,chuck,2010-12-19 12:25:00,7,Oh the poor leafs if only they could win
530134,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-12-19 21:55:00,0,blow leafs blow
530443,Rod Caster,2010-12-21 01:58:00,5784,Pretty quiet in here...I guess everyone stopped watching after 3 minutes and 2-0.  James Reimer in nets now. I think they are calling Allen Bester as I type just in case.
526051,Jer,2010-12-07 02:43:00,1426,...'nuff said.
526053,solopaddler,2010-12-07 02:48:00,8605,"I'm not planning the parade route, but man that was sweet."
526055,GBW,2010-12-07 02:56:00,8460,HH and I have seen the GUY that does the parade and I'm not following.  The win however was a shock as I tuned in at 4 WAS to 1 TOR when I got home from school.
526056,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-07 02:59:00,0,"Not by a long shot! First of all? Is it me or has anyone else noticed weak penalties against the leafs? Do you think that supposed slash by beauchemin was legit? Which gave the Caps a 5 on 3? And this is not the  first time, we have had some goals scored on because of weak calls. Not to mention the non call in overtime regarding Macarther!!!Speaking of McCarthur? He finally woke up!  Then we got robbed on the third goal because the referee turned the puck over to the caps. Talk about bad breaks!  Over all the team played well but the inexperience still shows. How many goals have we scored on the two on ones or breakaways?We have so many good chances and a lot of the time someone fans on the puck!! The other side gets one, two on one and they 65% of the time score.  Regardless.I will say our team from day one gets an A for effort.  The monster played his worst game of hockey. His confidence is clearly low. But he shined on the shoot out. I'm telling you, hold on to the monster. But why are our goaltenders always on their knees? How can you have positioning on your knees? Who is our goalie coach! Get rid of him!  Rosehill was invisible other then one hit late in the third that caused a turnover. He has to be more physical.  Why is it on the power play they all walk in and shoot on us and score, but our shots are blocked 90% of the time?  Good to see Kessel back checking and he really rang that one off the post!  Gabrovski's last goal was amazing!!!  Man I need some cough drops!! My throat is killing me from cheering!!!! I had to hear my brother say John they stink all night until the leafs shut him up!!!!!!!!"
526060,solopaddler,2010-12-07 03:06:00,8605,"I havn't watched too many games recently, but happened to watch the last 2, go figure.  I hadn't seen Aulie play yet this year. Can't believe this kid was essentially a throw in with the Calgary deal last winter.  He looks damn good, big, strong and mobile.  Loved the way he stood up Ovie in the first."
526066,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-07 03:17:00,0, Keep watching!lol  Grabovski should have been the second star!!! We still need to get that first line going! The Kuleiman line right now is kicking butt!!!!
526097,ctranter,2010-12-07 07:03:00,543,"What is the probability that someone with oppositional personality disorder will assault this thread later on?  Musky matt, Looking for walleye, you guys are awful quiet after games like this LOL."
526125,lookinforwalleye,2010-12-07 13:28:00,4399,"Well I would hate to disappoint you Rant,sorry I could not comment earlier but I hit the sack early us old guys need our sleep. From what I saw of the game I thought the Leafs were unlucky to get themselves down 4-1 and if Washington is going into the playofffs with that goalie it will be another early exit. And again I don`t hate the Leafs I just like to give Leaf fans the gears why because you guys win a couple and your a player or two away from being a dynasty,lose a couple and it`s fire this guy trade that guy. And remember it`s all in fun and it`s not personal."
526128,Headhunter,2010-12-07 13:41:00,5703,"I called building management and they have agreed to pull those chairs out of storage, so we can reserve our spots for the parade! I gotta admitt though, they are getting pretty tired of take'en them out and puttin' them back! HH"
526180,tb4me,2010-12-07 16:34:00,3295,I actually thught it was a horrible game. We were in the mancave watchin. All I have to say is thank god for darts n beer. Other wise that game would have been turned off. I wonder how many leaf fans switched it off only to find out they won this AM...lol Good work Toronto! I love it when we beat the caps! My dad remarried and when he did he left the Leafs too! went on to be a washington fan. Now his whole family are ovenchicken lovers..Looks good on em..he he he.
527771,tb4me,2010-12-12 17:34:00,3295,Well..... What happened to all the yappy habs fans now? Funny when the leafs are loosing there is non stop yappin going on in here..Go Leafs Go. Blow Habs Blow..Ya baby!! We need a stiring the pot emoticon..
527772,BiggFish,2010-12-12 17:42:00,40,"Hey guys,  Was a rather so slow game but any Saturday night I can watch the Leafs get a W i will. Especially against them no good habs.  Overall a good week 3/5 in the win department against 5 of the best teams in the league I think is not bad at all.  Chad"
527789,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-12-12 19:01:00,0, They probably can't hear you from way up there in the standings! Don't get me wrong... I live by the ABM principle (anyone but montreal) but I don't think the habs give a crap about toronto... hence Auld being in net.

527974,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-13 03:17:00,0,"Yep. It might have been different if Price was in net. Auld let in two very weak goals. Still...Montreal had a hard time generating any offense. We played well. Cannot say enough of Sjostrom's game. Versteeg is over all the best player on the ice. Gabrovski in second. Kadri has the most potential but he has to bulk up. Kaberle and Kessel finally scored. Kessel has to change up his game, and he has to stop admiring his shots. Most great goal scorers, score on their own rebound. Like I said. We need another line(other then the Kulieman line) and we are good to go. What a treat watching 4 games in a week!!!Go leafs Go!!!"
