531127,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-23 00:02:00,10439,I got out yesterday for a little 80km sled ride and I made it out for a few hours again today for some fishin'. Temps were pretty decent at -16 with light winds. I ended up trying a couple of new spots today (there were interlopers fishing last weeks spot)    All was not lost though as there is plenty of room for all. I set up about 200-300 yards away on another point and managed one 3 to 4 pound pike there. Then the action slowed so I moved to another point further up the lake and managed a couple of 3 to 3 1/2 pound whities there. I lost a couple and missed a few as well. All in all not a bad day.              Tomorrow will be gear cleaning and thawing day so all is ready for Friday's outing. I'll probably still get out fer a little sleddin' though.
