530485,cwpowell,2010-12-21 03:42:00,265, This sets up so easy can't wait to use it. Will be sweet.   This should keep us warm.   Found a 5lb tank after calling about 10 places and found it at the 1st place I called who said they didn't have any.   This also arrived in the mail. It was a free rebate when we bought the Minnkota Powerdrive V2
530488,EC1,2010-12-21 03:50:00,930,NICE! You're set for the rest of ice season!
530490,mercman,2010-12-21 03:50:00,7054,Hey !!! its not Christmas yet !! Santas gonna be pissed !!
530493,cwpowell,2010-12-21 03:56:00,265,"Mom was a little pissed! Haha! But we did get all that stuff for the price of a comparable ""CLAM"""
530559,MCTFisher9120,2010-12-21 14:32:00,3761,"Cool stuff, that hut and heater look awesome. Wonder what santa will put under my tree this year"
530574,Rob,2010-12-21 15:21:00,467,How do you steer that hut with the co pilot?  :blahblah1:  :clapping:  Rob C
530583,Calender Don,2010-12-21 15:53:00,39,"I got the same hut and heater, your going to love it."
530599,bassassin,2010-12-21 17:52:00,152,"I think you are going to need an inline filter between the tank and the heater. I may be wrong but you may want to check that out,you can probably get it from princess auto."
530639,cityfisher,2010-12-21 20:22:00,959,good stuff ! the hut looks pimp... my 2 man clam still does that job but is getting old... I also have the same buddy as you... amazing little unit
530931,cwpowell,2010-12-22 16:20:00,265,"Yep, can't wait to get out!  As for the buddy heater. I won't need a filter because we bought the 10ft buddy hose."
