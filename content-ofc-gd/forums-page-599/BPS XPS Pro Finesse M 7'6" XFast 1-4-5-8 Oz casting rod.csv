531040,swiftability,2010-12-22 20:52:00,14,"Thank you, fisherboy and thank you, Garry.  I've just got my new Revo SX and I gonna supertune it during winter time. I do think I'll put a new Suffix 20Lb braid line on it and try to toss some jigs/cranks/plastic lighter than 1/8 Oz to feel how this setup will work. I can't find my BPS receipt though  And I am not 100% sure they would take back their discontinued product. What would they do with it if there even no such a product code in their system anymore...."
529160,swiftability,2010-12-16 16:54:00,14,"Hello everyone,  I have the rod in my garage for almost a year, still in plastic  I tried it one time for walleye jigging on BOQ and got several nice fish one of them being my PB. But I felt the 1/2 Oz jigs I used were a bit heavy for this rod and put it aside for consideration and forgot about it . When I looked at it next time, a BPS 30-days return term had been already passed. So I am still guessing what I would use the rod for .  It is finesse rod so it would be logically to assume I could use it for wacky worms and light jigs but when I'm trying to cast such a bait using overhead or side cast, it flies anywhere but not to the target  I am not new to baitcasting and have about 10 setups with mostly shorter 6'3""-7' rods in MH class and only one 7'6"" being BPS Extreme 3'8-1 1/2 for pitching. For everything weightless like wacky warms I prefer spinning setup with 14Lb Power Pro and it is just perfect for me giving a distance and confidence when I'm casting against a wind. For some unknown reason I am not throwing crankbaits preferring to use 3/8-1/2 spinnerbaits instead and do it about 60% of my casting time...  So, I would be very grateful if you guys could turn me into the right direction by expressing your opinion what would you use this rod for? The outing I used it I put Daiwa TD-Pro with 12 Lb Seaguar AbrazX Fluo on it and it was a first time I used fluo as a main line on a baitcaster. I had overruns due to stiffness of fluro and finally switched back to Power Pro being much softer. So probably it was a reason of my poor short casting when I tried to throw jigs.  Thank you!"
529178,solopaddler,2010-12-16 17:58:00,8605,I'd use it either as a light bottom bouncing rod for walleye or trolling cranks.
529230,aplumma,2010-12-16 20:41:00,6896,With it spooled with a line you are comfortable with use it with plastics especially a Carolinia rigs or Texas rig should give you the feel you want and the speed to set the hook. I would also use a fast tipped rod while jerk baiting or frogging.  Art
529378,swiftability,2010-12-17 03:17:00,14,"2 Solopadler Thank you for reply. It has a nice PowerHump cork grip and it would be too brutal to put it in a rod-holder... It feels light and really finesse, trolling may overkill it, I suspect.  2 Aplumma  Certainly not for jerking, it is too long for it. I would touch water if I try walking-a-dog. Light Texas or Carolina, - may be... Just can't realize what technique it was initially designed for  My BPS Extreme I use for pitching was designed for Carolina rigs and there is this word on the blank. But it way heavier, - up to 1 1/2 Oz and has a decent backbone."
529380,mercman,2010-12-17 03:22:00,7054,"yup, What Art said.It would make an excellent topwater fishing rod.You get a fast hookset and all the bend is in the tip of the rod."
529383,spinnerbaitking,2010-12-17 03:28:00,1622,Lend it to me for the next year & I'll let you know what it worked best for Richard
529389,swiftability,2010-12-17 03:43:00,14," Wait until I pair it with Carbonlite reel I gonna buy when it comes on sale down from today's $119 and it will be a nice setup for something  But if seriously, - would you consider frog fishing a finesse technique? For some reason I use 6'6"" MH rod with braided line for it and some of my frogs are 1/2 Oz. I am not telling it is how it suppose to be (I don't really know and heard a lot of people prefer mono over braid for topwaters), but it gives me control and feeling I can always get the frog out of weeds or fallen trees."
529392,spinnerbaitking,2010-12-17 04:00:00,1622,I'd likely start with Crank baits & go from there Richard
529404,Garry2Rs,2010-12-17 04:44:00,1425,I think what you own is a Steelhead rod. The softness of the rod is to protect light line. You might also use it for live bait or casting crankbaits of the appropriate weigh.
529411,swiftability,2010-12-17 05:15:00,14," Hmmm.... I doubt it's too short for steelheading. And the tip is Xtra Fast. I have Frontier 13' and couple other rods for trout, the ProLite Finesse is absolutely different. And it wasn't in trout section of the store either. I read some people use shorter versions in ML for shaky warms, weightless plastic, roboworms etc., but it is much more convenient to use spinning setup for this purpose, not 7'6"" M what I have."
529445,skeeter,2010-12-17 13:45:00,1907,why not contact the manufacture and ask them what it was designed for?
529448,steverowbotham,2010-12-17 13:49:00,1800,"Because BPS hasnt manufactured these rods in over a year.  I would say your best bet is for finesse fishing as the name implies.  Light dropshots, tubes, grubs etc."
529450,steverowbotham,2010-12-17 13:50:00,1800,"Also, BPS offers a 1 year exchange on their own brands which includes XPS if you can provide your receipt"
529477,swiftability,2010-12-17 15:03:00,14," Oh, do they? I thought it is a warranty, not exchange/refund or a gift card. I'll check this, thank you!"
529596,Garry2Rs,2010-12-17 20:37:00,1425,"  I am not suggesting that you should use this rod for Steelheading in Ontario.  I thought you asked what the rod was designed for, and I believe that it is a Salmon/Steelhead casting rod.  While it is true that we are used to seeing spinning rods of much greater lengths used for Steelheading, 7'6"" is the starting length for most companies Steelhead casting rods.  Your rod is a 90 inches long and appears top be about a Medium-Light.  Here is some info from Shimano on one of their 90"" Steelhead/Salmon casting rods...  CEC90ML2 Classic drift fishing technique using roe, sand shrimp, corkies and yarn.  There are real Steelhead runs all along the West Coast, perhaps on some of their rivers they use different techniques and equipment than we see in Ontario."
529612,swiftability,2010-12-17 21:12:00,14,"Thank you, Garry, I do appreciate your input.  I will definitely try it for Steelhading this spring, you're right it may be a good rod for that. Not for drift fishing but for throwing light lures at least. I've never seen BPS Steelhading rods yet or anything made by BassPro for this fish. I live 10 minutes away from the store and unfortunately spend my time there more often than I go fishing  That's a kind of ""dry fishing"" when my wife is doing her shopping in Vaugham Mills. So I am still suspect it was designed for some bass fishing, but the length makes me suspicious  Please don't consider me rude, Garry, I really grateful to everyone helping me with my question. Still hope someone on the forum has the same rod or with similar test/length characteristics and would share his experience."
529613,kickingfrog,2010-12-17 21:12:00,8333,"I believe I have the exact same rod. I used it for the first, and only, time this spring for walleye. I intended to use it for casting crank baits and maybe drifting harnesses on 3 way rigs. It worked very well casting tail dancers and wally divers. I did also use it for trolling. It worked fine for that too, although it did seam to be close to its limits with the extra deep diving baits. I still intend to use it as a 3 way harness outfit, but know it will serve as a back-up to a trolling set up as well."
529615,aplumma,2010-12-17 21:23:00,6896, I actually do not own any rods shorter than 7ft My favorite rod is 7ft 6 inch with a core reel built by Chris and it is a dream for froggin and jerkin. I am using it off of a bass boat with a high deck I guess it is why it doesn't seem to be to long for me. I have one of the BPS with the power hump. For some reason the hump and the thinness of the cork made it a poor fit for my left hand and it was really tip heavy but it has gone to a good home one of my friends son is retiring his spinning reel and stepping up to a baitcaster. Keep searching and trying it in different applications  I am sure one of them will stick.  Art
529617,swiftability,2010-12-17 21:25:00,14,"When we are talking about finesse fishing with a baitcaster, does it mean we should use a lighter line? I always used 50Lb on my baitcasters and 12Lb mono, not less because line deeps into a spool. Would you use 10Lb or even 8Lb mono or braid with equivalent thickness on a baitcaster? Of course I add 6-10 Lb fluo leader, but what about a main line?"
529618,solopaddler,2010-12-17 21:27:00,8605," Even on the left coast I doubt that's a rod they'd ever use for steelhead Garry.     Ironically enough the exact same two ways I said I would use the rod.  I believe Steve Rowbotham likely nailed the rods ""actual"" purpose. A lighter line finesse rod for small tubes, dropshotting, etc.."
529906,Garry2Rs,2010-12-18 19:54:00,1425,"  There is a question of using the right tool for the job here, and spinning gear will always handle light line and light baits better than casting gear.  However, putting that argument aside, there are three basic problems to overcome...  First, picking a tangle out of fine line will be a nightmare.  So, mono and Fluoro might not be a great choice.  Second, small diameter line might find it's way between the spool and the frame, so a high quality reel might be needed.  Third, the outfit needs to balance, so finding a medium light casting rod will be important.  I own a 50 size Calcutta and have a Loomis-Frontier ML rod.  I have spooled it with 20# Powerpro and 14 # Fireline fused, which are both the same diameter as 6-8 pound mono.  My intention was to use it to throw very small crankbaits like 03, 05 or 07 Original Rapala's etc.  The truth is, even with this light tackle, it's hard to generate the tip speed to throw these 1/16th and 1/8oz. baits very far.  The fact that light casting rods tend to be 6ft. and under doesn't help with distance either.  In the end I went back to spinning gear for the tiny lures and threw 3/16th and 1/4oz baits with this outfit."
529960,esoxansteel,2010-12-18 23:48:00,1307,"Id use it for staking up tomato plants, oh I mis read at 7.6ft it would be better suited for staking up the Marley Barley   were Jammin were Jammin I want to jammin with you"
530061,swiftability,2010-12-19 15:27:00,14,"  Thank you for your informative and kind reply, Garry! A most reason of my question was that sometimes I run into posts at another forums where people state they're using even 6 Lb mono what simply amazed me. A fishing expert at WFN mentioned she uses 20Lb braid for baitcasting but when I PM her to specify this, she didn't respond for some reason.  So, from your response I realized this is quite possible but doesn't give any advantages to a spinning setup and requires quality reel. I think I'll try to supertune my Revo SX-HS what is on its way to me or BPS Carbonlite reel and try to find a decent 6+ feet ML rod to make myself busy during winter months  P.S. When you mentioned the outfit should be balanced, did you mean a light blank + light reel or that a balance point should be right under your reel or very close to it? I've found rods longer than 6'6"" have their tips too heavy to achieve a balance with an average 8.5 Oz baitcaster and by that reason even got a balancing kit from BPS to tune my BPS Extreme and old Bionic rods."
530072,Garry2Rs,2010-12-19 16:54:00,1425,"When I said balance I was referring to a light action rod with a smaller light weight reel and small diameter line.  Don't worry about using 20# braid.  I used 20# braid, for several years, on all my bass size casting reels.  Eventually, I moved up to 30# when my well used 20# line started to break on the cast.  Having read the reviews and write-up about the new Sufix 832, with the Gore-Tex thread in it, I now suspect the breakage was due to the tightly woven fibers cutting themselves with long use.  With the ultra smooth bearings and tight tolerances of today's premium reels, there's no reason that light weight mono couldn't be used.  For practicality, I would use braid.  It's easier to untangle, casts just as well and gives you roughly 3 times the strength for the same diameter."
531036,fisherboy,2010-12-22 20:30:00,48,"I have a Shimano Calcutta ML 7'6"" XF rod. It's a rod similar to yours, except maybe mine is softer throughout. According to Shimano's website: <BR><BR>""A great rod for anglers looking to maximize casting distance with soft plastics, small topwaters, spoons and plastics. "" <BR><BR>I personally use it for crankbaits. I like its length. <BR><BR>BTW, you can try to return your rod to BPS with a receipt even if it's over 30 days old. You won't get a refund, but you can the credit back on a BPS card."
