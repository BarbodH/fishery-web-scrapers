524410,Gerritt,2010-12-02 00:49:00,6129,You mean it is not built like this?         Eddie... I am going to teach you how to built a outhouse  (yes that is me in the pics)  G
524430,lookinforwalleye,2010-12-02 01:59:00,4399,My motto measure 5 times cut once.

Not ME!!!!   Now about that outhouse...  G"
524527,solopaddler,2010-12-02 12:23:00,8605,Eddie there'll be some carpenters at your Richter camp. 
524938,EddieNorth,2010-12-03 14:19:00,64,Looks like the guy I need to build a huge main lodge someday!
524956,solopaddler,2010-12-03 15:03:00,8605," Maybe.  Even better let's see if Mike Homes wants to do a fly-in reno.  I can picture it now:  ""My God, what kind of buffoons built this place? We're gonna have to raze it to the ground and start from scratch!""  Shazam, 5 star camp built!!   (Actually it would make for a great show. Hmmmm......  )"
525039,tb4me,2010-12-03 19:17:00,3295,Im a skilled tradesman Eddie! work out a deal in trade perhaps?!!! Wishfull thinkin I know
525116,Gerritt,2010-12-03 23:10:00,6129,"I have worked for Holmes in the past and been on three episodes. This is not something I normally tell people. Has anyone ever seen the house near Bronte Creek built from straw bales? I helped build that house. It just so happens the producer for Holmes on Homes and Real Renos, owns it.  Mike... I could get you in touch with Mike Quast (the producer) if you like,  G."
525122,Roy,2010-12-03 23:27:00,13728,"Hey Eddie! If you can tell me a hardship story, I'll gladly share it with a bud. He'll come over with his crew, sans bus. "
525126,Gerritt,2010-12-03 23:33:00,6129,"  Hahahahaha!!!!  ""Move that bus, Move that bus!"""
525133,solopaddler,2010-12-03 23:59:00,8605," Unreal, who knew. I'd love to get in touch with the producer.   Roy I can't speak for Eddie, but that'll likely be a no."
525134,misfish,2010-12-03 23:59:00,29133,"Never mind that jack  I hate those shows.  Keep,n it real, by the sounds of Ed and his places."
525136,solopaddler,2010-12-04 00:02:00,8605, Are you kidding me?  Having that crew fly into the camp would be like winning the lottery.
526048,EddieNorth,2010-12-07 02:03:00,64,"Heres my hardluck story,,,,,,its tough being a leaf fan these days"
526052,solopaddler,2010-12-07 02:43:00,8605," Not much of a hardluck story tonight, what a game!"

530498,EddieNorth,2010-12-21 04:21:00,64,"Hey Guys,we are now booking Richter Lake,we have the building already precut and painted ready to put together 24 x 20 with a screened in porch.The first week of may 28th is booked,june 4th and on is open.The camp runs saturday to saturday.Email or call me for any info,,[email protected] or 1-902-436-1361.  Merry Christmas Everyone,  Eddie"
522781,Gerritt,2010-11-25 21:52:00,6129,he is not leaving his old camp... he is opening another! in my understanding anyways...  and the reason we need to wait till Sept. is he needs to build it!  We could fish the old camp anytime... but this offer is for the new camp on VIRGIN waters.  I am super stoked!  G
522786,solopaddler,2010-11-25 21:57:00,8605,"  This is copied and pasted from my original post at the top of the page:  ""It goes without saying that if this piques your interest for a trip of your own, give Eddie a ring.""   Obviously you don't have to wait 'till September LOL! You can book Richter anytime you want for a trip of your own.  The camp should be completed by late May and from that point on he'll be open for business.  Eddie's contact info is on the website which Rob already posted.  The price as mentioned is $1495 Canadian dollars tax in.  Eddie is probably the guy to talk to if this is something you're considering. He's a fantastic individual, runs a great operation and will work hard to make your trip a success."
522787,solopaddler,2010-11-25 21:58:00,8605," Yeah right, he's not leaving the old camp, just building and opening a new one!"
522793,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-25 22:11:00,4399, I am stoked with ya Gerritt the only downer is the wait!
523051,EddieNorth,2010-11-26 18:07:00,64,"Hey guys hope all is well,just to clarify we are going to have 2 camps running this year Beteau Lake and Richter Lake.Nothing will be closing and we hope to expand somemore in the future.  Thank you all for your past and present patronage,  Merry Christam and a Happy New Year,  Eddie"
523091,hoops12,2010-11-26 21:16:00,127,I will be there May 28th.  Can't wait!!
523206,EddieNorth,2010-11-27 05:02:00,64,"I spoke with the gentlemen I lease the lake from tonight and he has informed me that it was fantastic Northern fishing 20 plus years ago and the walleye fishing was super aswell.i can hardley wait to get in there myself,with 14 hours of daylight,we will have time to check out the fishing after working most of the day building the new camp."
523234,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-27 14:19:00,4399," Hey Eddie as long as you leave a few of those big gators for our group!!  After the trip I may have to change my handle to ""foundsomewalleye"""

From what i've seen on google earth the water looks really good, and we will definitely be trying a portage or 2 into the other 2 lakes if we can't get the boats in there.  Our group is the first in for the year, So anyone wanting to book a week, from the beginning of june on, just give eddie a call, 180 days to go!!! man thats way too long!!!!"
523746,kickingfrog,2010-11-29 20:27:00,8333,277 days here... but who's countin'?

523921,Roy,2010-11-30 14:06:00,13728, Now there's a dang good reason to fish as much as possible just to stay away from camp! You should list that on your site with local attractions!
523943,hoops12,2010-11-30 15:09:00,127,"Hey Eddie,  What will the new camp have for us in May?  Hoops12"

524006,solopaddler,2010-11-30 19:20:00,8605,Sounds great.  You're going to be a busy guy come ice out.  Regarding the Sept trip to Richter all the slots are filled.
524067,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-30 22:08:00,4399,  What no hot tub!
524081,Spiel,2010-11-30 23:39:00,9065, I'm gonna guess snow.

524122,Gerritt,2010-12-01 02:18:00,6129,Brrrrrrrrrrr.....   :canadian:  :canadian:
524152,EddieNorth,2010-12-01 04:15:00,64,"Yes sir busy year coming up,lots of building to do but we have the crew and the desire ,  throw in a few cases of beer and shasam,,,cabin built!"
524237,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-01 16:17:00,10439,  It's true. Here's the last cabin Eddie and his drunk buddies built!!!  
522361,solopaddler,2010-11-23 00:26:00,8605,"So I just got a call from Eddie, it appears as though he's aquired a new lease to open a new camp on a brand new body of water that's never been fished before.  It's on Richter lake which is directly west of his Beteau camp on the Attawapiskat and just south of Lansdowne House.  According to Frank Moonias the elder who's giving him the lease the lake has never been fished by natives as it's inaccessable and obviously there's never been a camp on it.  It's approximately 4km long and 2km wide and has a substantial river flowing through it which appears to give you access to several more lakes both upstream and downstream.  If anyone's curious here's the latitude and longitude: Degrees, Minutes, Seconds: 52° 5' 57"" N 87° 53' 0"" W Decimal Degrees: 52.099° N 87.884° W UTM Coordinates: 16U 439475 5772451 Topographic Map Sheet Number: 043D04   To me it's a no brainer.  So anyway he's offered me Sept 3-10 to come in and check it out.  If anyone is interested in joining me on this adventure shoot me a pm. I think we're looking at a minimum of four maximum of 6 people for this trip. The price will be the same as the Beteau camp.  It goes without saying that if this piques your interest for a trip of your own give Eddie a ring.  He'll be flying in asap in May to construct the new camp and fly in boats, motors, gas and equipment. It may be a rough camp but it'll be up and running for the 2011 season.  Cheers"
522383,Gerritt,2010-11-23 01:21:00,6129,"Mike, What would the cost be approx.?"
522386,solopaddler,2010-11-23 01:27:00,8605," Hey bud it's the same price as Eddie's Beteau camp, $1495 Canadian tax in."
522391,Gerritt,2010-11-23 01:35:00,6129,time to see if I have enough pennies saved in coin jar  thanks for the heads up!
522395,solopaddler,2010-11-23 01:43:00,8605,"  It would awesome if you could swing it! Rob (Kickingfrog) ""may"" be on board already."
522396,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-11-23 01:45:00,0,"If you're still looking for people this winter i might be able to say yes.  At this point it's more of a ""I'd like to come"" post... so, sort of pointless, but I felt the need to say something.  Looks like a glorious opportunity!"
522404,fishnsled,2010-11-23 02:02:00,3520,If I wasn't looking at a big repair bill for the motor I'd be all over this.
522407,solopaddler,2010-11-23 02:08:00,8605," Just book it!! (it's easier to ask for forgiveness rather than permission.  )     Meh, it's almost a year away, you can do it!"
522409,uglyfish,2010-11-23 02:23:00,981,"I'd totally do that.... Ya know, if my wife wouldn't divorce me for doin that. Lol."
522433,chris.brock,2010-11-23 02:57:00,4053,"that's a great opportunity, untouched lakes are hard to come by, that's also an awesome area to be lucky enough to explore, looking forward to the trip reports from the first OFNer's to get in there"
522455,Gerritt,2010-11-23 04:47:00,6129,Well I have permission from she who must be obeyed... Now to count the pennies in the coffer....   Will let you know Mike...  When do you need a deposit by?  G.
522471,solopaddler,2010-11-23 10:52:00,8605, Dude that's awesome! As far as deposits it's not a huge rush. When the spots are all filled I'll contact Eddie and we'll likely send them in then.
522474,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-11-23 12:09:00,1362,"Mike, what species of fish are in the lake??"
522507,lhousesoccer,2010-11-23 14:59:00,442,"I'm curious on the same thing. Trophy pike?  If so, I'm seriously considering jumping in on the trip!"
522517,Kinger,2010-11-23 15:49:00,351,"Doc, lets go!!! Dreams would become tangible for me!"
522525,solopaddler,2010-11-23 16:30:00,8605, Sorry I thought it was understood. It's walleye and pike same as the Beteau camp.    Don't know if it's a trophy fishery or not. No one's fished it yet.
522615,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-24 21:32:00,4399,Hi Mike I sent you an e-mail but the way the board is lately I don`t know if you rec`d it but I am definately interested!
522626,solopaddler,2010-11-24 23:21:00,8605, Got it bud and replied.
522640,AzuluSpookd,2010-11-25 03:25:00,348,Oh solo...that sounds so appealing.....but I'm already moose hunting just south of there from Sept 18 to 30th...not sure my wife would appreciate me being gone the entire month of Sept....or maybe she would?
522642,irishfield,2010-11-25 03:27:00,26272,Did you want me to check on her Marty???  I'd be game Mike.. but I'm HOPING that we'll still be at the camp and enjoying the back lakes around there at that time.
522684,solopaddler,2010-11-25 17:32:00,8605,Kickingfrog and lookinforwalleye are confirmed.  Still a few guys on the fence.  Step up now if you want to go.
522762,solopaddler,2010-11-25 21:10:00,8605,Alright Gerritt's confirmed!  Two more spots open (although I have a few guys on the fence right now)
522768,tb4me,2010-11-25 21:35:00,3295,You will have to excuse me on this one question. Why is it we have ot wait till next sept to go? Is he booked up all next summer? Id like to go  but there is no way  could go in Sept. If he has other dates avaiable and a few other OFNERS want to go id be game...Just not in sept thats all. Sounds like the trip of a lifetime to me! 3 grand and the wife can come too..so is that $1500 all in? We sure would like some ore info. Does he have a web site..again sorry if these seem like dumb questions but this is the first im hearing of this chance!
