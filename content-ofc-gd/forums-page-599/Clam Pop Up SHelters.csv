530148,livinisfishin,2010-12-19 22:56:00,661,  I am looking into getting one and then i came across this video....
530151,camillj,2010-12-19 23:02:00,1988,Love my Eastman Cube .. same basic design ... dont really go looking for pinholes so I cant say if it suffers the same issue... but all in all REALLY happy with it (although I recommmend the 4 man if there are 2 of you ... the 2 man is quite comfortable for one guy 2 holes...
530154,livinisfishin,2010-12-19 23:26:00,661, Is the eastman the same as all the hub style pop up shelters?
530157,misfish,2010-12-19 23:34:00,29133,My hunting blind looks like that. Is so cool that I can see the galaxy.
530159,livinisfishin,2010-12-19 23:38:00,661, lol not cool when you are trying to black out everything so you can see the bottom of your hole
530171,Fisherman,2010-12-20 00:23:00,7201,"Clam has it's share of junky parts too, sub standard nuts and bolts that break off, wispy thin material that looks like panty hose from the inside out...go get an Otter, better material and quality."
530176,livinisfishin,2010-12-20 00:28:00,661,"who carries otter , bass pro?"
530184,Rob,2010-12-20 00:49:00,467,"I have the guide that I bought 3 years ago. I am very happy with it, but I have to say, they have really cheaped out over the last couple of years. My buddy bought one for more than I paid for mine and he has these puny little seats, material is pathetically thin and the seats don't even slide or swivel. I do like the Equinox huts, they have put a lot into design and the materials are very good quality.  Rob"
530191,Fish Farmer,2010-12-20 01:06:00,2234,I thought I was looking through mine. My Clam Guide has gone the same way. I'd never buy another Clam
530195,livinisfishin,2010-12-20 01:17:00,661,"They all look the same to me , im trying to figure out why the 4 man subzero one at canadian tire is 300 dollars, yet a clam or frabill one is under 200 dollars?"
530211,Fisherman,2010-12-20 02:04:00,7201,"I don't know if BPro still carries the Otter cabins, I ordered mine from Riverside Outdoors in Thunder Bay, ships via Greyhound, very good price. http://www.riversideoutdoors.ca/catalog/index.php?cPath=111_113&osCsid=f25138bd835592b5e82712af4ad854ae"
530216,irishfield,2010-12-20 02:11:00,26272,Am I reading their site correctly.. you have to buy the sled as well as the Ice Inn to fit same separately?
530226,Fisherman,2010-12-20 03:07:00,7201,"Yes and no, They sell sleds separately if you only want the sled or replacement tops, you can also biy the complete packages, I think they're on another page. http://www.otteroutdoors.com/portablefishhousepackages.html"
530257,GBW,2010-12-20 13:52:00,8460,my clam 2000 is like that too but it doesn't leak or have the wind go through it.  I'm setting mine up this week and spraying it because it's over 5 years old.
530259,canadadude,2010-12-20 13:59:00,769,"What a shame how this company has gone downhill in the past few years,at one time there huts were top of the line.I've heard so many horror stories relating to the quality of there products lately I'll stay away from anything Clam Corp sells, there are far better products on the market at the same or cheaper prices."
530285,livinisfishin,2010-12-20 15:37:00,661,"I came across the killzone igloo xl its 160 us, I can't find anywhere that will ship to canada. On ebay there was a two man tundra tuff by eastman, but I cannot find a four man. I really didn't think it would be that hard to get one of these."
530326,Rich,2010-12-20 19:02:00,3927,"I got the 0 Celcius one or whatever it is, works good for what it does. 2 seasons so far."
530362,camillj,2010-12-20 21:33:00,1988,4 man eastman cube is at Le Baron
530370,Sinker,2010-12-20 22:09:00,8692,"In my experience, they will all do that in time. I've had an eskimo, and two clams that have both ended up like that. No big deal, they don't leak rain, and still block the wind. I can see your point about blacking out the hut though..........  S."
530394,lunkerbasshunter,2010-12-20 23:42:00,2585,"one time clam had the best in the biz.  however if you notice in fish shops, you see alot of guys like eskimo, ht tech taking over the floor space.  i guess clam is going down hill after all???"
530444,2jack2,2010-12-21 01:59:00,92,Where does Eskimo and Eastman pop up ice hut made in?
530455,discophish,2010-12-21 02:33:00,392,"Similar to the Eastman.  We have a couple of the 2 man Eastmans that I'm very impressed with them.  Not because they keep the wind off our backs, but because they have been to hell and back and are still nice and tight.  When tethered at all sides while using snow kicks, they are bomb proof."
530468,Aaron Shirley,2010-12-21 02:55:00,655,"I have the CTC version of the Eastman Cube (Sub Zero). I like it, but there are a million pin holes in it and the wind does go right through it on a cold windy day. Even with my Mr.Buddy heater it can be a bit cool with the wind blowing through it. I sprayed mine at the end of last season, so hopefully it helps with the wind a bit.  Other than it starting to come apart in the corners and strap pockets, it has been a good shelter for me. I use it a lot and it has gone through 3 years of heavy use, so I am happy. I do like the design and it is great for 2 people to fish in. Lots of room and comfortable for 2 guys with all their gear. It is a good option for guys that walk like me, or have an ATV and pack light.  It is very stable in the wind with all the straps secured to the ice, but the drawback is set-up time, and anchoring the ice anchors are labour intensive unless you have a cordless drill. I find moving often is a chore with set-up and tear-down times. Having said that, I believe the pop-up style hut is the best option for guys that walk that enjoy spending time in the same hut and socialize.  I imagine that most of the pop-up style shelters are similar. I am interested in the Clam pop-up with the thermal, as that should solve the wind problem and condensation dripping down. Also, the Clam pop-up has 2 doors in opposite corners which is brilliant.  Good fishing!  Aaron"
530482,livinisfishin,2010-12-21 03:34:00,661,"Went to canadian tire today, the ht 4 man instashak price was $ 299. I asked when it would go on sale and was told second week of january..asked how much, $50 off. So total $250. Went to the lebaron website as suggested and saw the same hut for $212 dollars. The two man is $150. Thinking of going there now."
