530427,Joey,2010-12-21 01:25:00,9122,"Hmm, not sure, tried to find it on the web, but its hard with no idea.  Kinda looks like a box fish, but they seem more colourful."
530428,highdrifter,2010-12-21 01:29:00,2534,Looks poisonous..  whatever it is!!
530429,Leecher,2010-12-21 01:29:00,7832,Ummmm looks like a puffer of some sort
530449,discophish,2010-12-21 02:19:00,392,Mom?!  Is that you?!  Why are you with this gentlemen?  Who is he?  I thought you were supposed to be on a business trip?  Mom!  What about dad???!!  What are you doing out of the water?!!  Mom!  No!!!
530450,Terry,2010-12-21 02:22:00,14456,looks like a puffer
530459,mercman,2010-12-21 02:41:00,7054,yup one of the many sub-species of boxfish for sure.Not sure which one though.
530461,Raf,2010-12-21 02:43:00,3495,how'd it taste?
530463,centerpinFTW,2010-12-21 02:49:00,9,I think it might be a cowfish
530472,GBW,2010-12-21 03:03:00,8460,"naw, more like a blower..."
530477,mercman,2010-12-21 03:20:00,7054,  leaf blower

530480,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-21 03:23:00,0,Cowfish.
530481,Terry,2010-12-21 03:28:00,14456,"NO  this is a leaf blower               <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=LeafBlower.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/LeafBlower.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"
530483,Roy,2010-12-21 03:35:00,13728,"Cowfish have horns, boxfish are spotted...guess again."
530484,fishnsled,2010-12-21 03:35:00,3520,I believe it is a cowfish. Caught a couple while I was in Cuba a few years ago. At least that is what I was told they were. Check this picture from another site. (Not me)  cowfish  Edit - A lot of the different types do have the horns Roy. Maybe my guide didn't know what he was talking about.
530486,Old Man,2010-12-21 03:44:00,822,  Now that's funny.
530505,limeyangler,2010-12-21 05:13:00,5204,"  yeah...i'm pretty sure its a cowfish, we caught them as kids in the Carribean. Although there is another type of cowfish that looks the same as that that actually has 2 horns(like a cow) , i'm not joking either."
530551,addy79,2010-12-21 14:07:00,573,I say Cowfish. Caught one in Cuba too
530563,Beans,2010-12-21 14:52:00,3339,Looks like a disgruntled grunt to me...
530602,MikeFisher,2010-12-21 17:54:00,6," Heya Gerritt, thanks for the Link to the Bord.  the Fish shown above is a Spotted Trunkfish, which is a Cowfish. Boxfish is an other name for the same Spezies.  Happy Holidays  Mike"
530610,JohnF,2010-12-21 18:53:00,3494,I'm guessing Boxfish but I'm no expert. The mouth doesn't seem quite right but the fin positions and shape are pretty much right on. The pale colour may be something to do with shock or just being out of the water. I'll see if I can find my tropical fish ID book at home. I have no idea where it might be though since we moved.  JF
530613,misfish,2010-12-21 18:55:00,29133,"Same body shape. Ugly look,n sucker.  "
530679,Gerritt,2010-12-21 21:51:00,6129,"  Thanks Mike. I think it puts this one to bed, and welcome back.  G"
530720,MikeFisher,2010-12-21 23:55:00,6," it's a pleasure Gerritt, even that I am not much on the Bords, lately the Time does not permit much of the usual pleasures. they are available in quiet a bunch of colours/shapes, I would guess depending on their specific Surroundings and Feedings, but I never paid special Attention to them. there are so many around our Tropical Reef Areas, most I could not Name. it is not unusual to catch a fish here without a Clue 'what da heck are ya', and then You need to ask around more than just one neighbour to get the right Lead and finally maybe find it in a book with a Foto. as You know my primary Area are the bigger Guys found offshore, the Tropical Reef Fishies are the once in a while extra pleasure when casting a Fly from a Skiff to get some Time away from the Crowds.  Merry Xmas  Mike"
