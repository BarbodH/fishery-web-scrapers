I went online to renew my three year license and i realized my card wasn't in my wallet  My question is the paper i get when i renew - does it take the place of the old card, or do i need the old card and the paper to be legal?  It states that it takes 20 days to get the new card in the mail."
530936,walleyejack,2010-12-22 16:40:00,358,"When you apply for the new one, you print a temporary paper license out and that is good to go,till the hard copy comes in snail mail."
530938,Terry,2010-12-22 16:47:00,14456,the paper you have should have your card number on it  punch it in on-line and print a temp and order the three year
530939,stubbex1,2010-12-22 16:48:00,164,perfect.  thanks guys!
530948,bubbles,2010-12-22 17:03:00,591,"Also when you print your new one it will show that you have an existing one and how long it is valid for. I love this on line stuff, imagine the mess you would be in if this was 10 years ago!"

Using your E-licence  An E-licence becomes valid when it is carried with either:  * an Outdoors Card containing the same 15-digit number as the E-licence  OR  * an Ontario Resident Temporary Fishing Licence and Outdoors Card and Application containing the same personal information as that under which the E-licence was obtained.  When either of these conditions is met, the E-licence entitles the Ontario resident to fish (or hunt small game) during the open season according to the licence(s) purchased.  The above might cause you problems if you don't have your new card by the time you want to go fishing and only have the printed E-Licence.  Tom."
