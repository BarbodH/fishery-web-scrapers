530800,brandon,2010-12-22 02:30:00,857,thanks guys and great shots Joey!!  I'm glad someone with a camera was able to capture the whole eclipse!
530509,brandon,2010-12-21 07:52:00,857,"I was really hoping to photograph the entire eclipse tonight...or this morning...whatever time of day this is....but clouds ruined my plans.  I did however manage one photo about 15-20 mins before the full eclipse....hopefully everyone else had better viewing conditions!  And for anyone interested, here's the deets... Canon EOS 5D mk II + Canon EF 500mm f/4L IS USM 1/25 @ f/7.1, ISO 1000, 500mm   Lunar Eclipse Dec 21, 2010 by bbroderick86, on Flickr"
530510,lew,2010-12-21 08:06:00,12766,"Too bad your not up this way Brandon, there's not a cloud in the sky and the eclipse is perfectly visible. I've been out on the back deck for awhile now watching it and it's really an imprssive sight the way the moon took on a sort of red glow.  Wish I was able to get a picture but my little point & shoot would only show it as a white dot."
530511,Joey,2010-12-21 09:20:00,9122,"I got tons, just waiting for them to upload"
530512,Joey,2010-12-21 09:29:00,9122,"Okay, here's a few, I'll post the rest in the morning, or should I say later today   I'm going back to bed!!        "
530513,lew,2010-12-21 10:15:00,12766,"Awesome pictures Joey, specially the 1st one !!"
530514,Rich Clemens,2010-12-21 10:22:00,3131,"Once in a lifetime shots.  Totally cloud cover down here, so I didn't even bother getting up.  Looking forward to seeing the shots that you were able to catpure.  Good night Joey.  Good morning Lew."
530515,solopaddler,2010-12-21 10:28:00,8605,"Cool photos.  Was watching it at work (still here   ), without a cloud in he sky.  For about an hour prior to it starting coyotes were yipping like mad.  As soon as the eclipse started they went deathly silent."
