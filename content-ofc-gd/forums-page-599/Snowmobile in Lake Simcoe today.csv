530649,Jds63,2010-12-21 20:51:00,1365,Snowmobile went through the ice .... (grandfather and granddaughter are ok thank God)  If and adult is stupid enough to try right now then go ahead but I don't get why you would endanger a child like that ....  http://www.thestar.com/news/article/910438--snowmobile-falls-into-lake-simcoe?bn=1
530651,toca,2010-12-21 20:57:00,274,hmm i thought you need at least six-ten inches of ice(maybe black ice) to hold up a atv or snowmobile.  but then again grandpa might have misjudge the condition
530656,NAW,2010-12-21 21:03:00,4022,I had the link copied and was about to post the same thing..  Are you friggen kidding me.  With his grand-daughter.

Here's another Link..  http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20101221/snowmobile-ice-lake-simcoe-101221/20101221/?hub=TorontoNewHome
530661,crappieperchhunter,2010-12-21 21:19:00,2582,Gotta agree..if you wanna be irresponsible on early ice...well who is going to stop you. But take your grandchild along...your an idiot.
530662,dsn,2010-12-21 21:19:00,1018,"It never amazes me. Someone always bites the dust every year. We humans.... slow to learn and quick to judge.      Year after year... same old , same old."
530669,LeXXington,2010-12-21 21:34:00,1928,"First DUMB ASS of the season,"
530671,Old Man,2010-12-21 21:38:00,822,The ice has only just become safe at our lake here in NW Ontario and some in the area still arent't safe. I can't imagine that someone would think Simcoe was safe for a sled.
530680,Terry,2010-12-21 21:51:00,14456,"along the east side there are lots of snowmobile tracks near the shoreline and yesterday there was an ATV heading out.....there is enough ice there for snowmobiles, but not all the way across the lake and not on the Keswick side it never freezes as fast as the west side of the lake..  I will bet there are lots of machines going out at Virgina beach too..but you do need to know the conditions where you are and you sure don't take kids out this time of year........."
530713,misfish,2010-12-21 23:18:00,29133,Glad they both made out safe.
530714,cwpowell,2010-12-21 23:23:00,265,"Brutal, my father and I have plans to head out on Friday morning, with our new clam. We will be heading out from Gilford."
530755,otter649,2010-12-22 01:07:00,118,"People who venture on ice should use/observe the 4-8-12 rule.  Walk on 4"" Sled on 8"" Vehicle on 12""  Better to be safe than sorry (or worse)......."
530758,Fisherpete,2010-12-22 01:16:00,1814,"I walked out today from Gilford, probably over 100 people out there perching.  Fishing was average, caught 100+ in 7 hours but not very good size at all.  4-5"" of good ice everywhere I went, another inch or two of white ice on top.  Saw a half dozen snowmobiles and a few ATV's out there... after seeing a snowmobile go thru the ice at high speed last year on Quinte (2 older men, and luckily they survived), I was hoping I didn't see another one today, thankfully I didn't. It is scary as hell. Wait another week for the machines people, the perch will still be there!"
530767,Leecher,2010-12-22 01:31:00,7832,Very unfortunate incident but this kid on the rideau was not as fortunate  Rideau River  Condolences goes out to his family Leechman
