530940,Hooked,2010-12-22 16:48:00,891,"Well the timing sucks big time, buy my wife got in a car accident last week and now just found out my Ford Focus wagon is apparently a right off.  Thankfully she is ok, but some lady took a turn too fast and wide on a side street and she tail-spinned into my car.  Here is where I need some help.  I have till December 29th to find a new vehicle, grrr.  I'm looking for another wagon and been searching for a Mazda 6 Wagon.  At least with that I should be able to tow a small boat.  But willing to settle for another Ford Focus Wagon ZTW.  So if anyone here has any leads, please let me know.  I live in Stoney Creek and the price range is probably up to $7500.  Tall order for sure considering I've looked on Kijiji and Autotrader.  Any help would be great!  Thanks Ted"

530946,jedimaster,2010-12-22 16:53:00,3472,Take a look at the AWD wagons if your gonna tow with it. Might make getting the boat out of the water a bit easier if its raining or a gravel ramp... maybe a Subaru or audi

531058,GBW,2010-12-22 21:48:00,8460,I love my Subaru wagon.  On the other hand the way boat-itus works you may want to look bigger.  Like a Ford Flex.
531198,Hooked,2010-12-23 03:07:00,891,"Thanks for the replies everyone, appreciated.  Yeah GBW, I was looking at a Subaru Outback wagon (2000 @ 144k for 6500) and a Forrester.  Still undecided, but not worried about a boat, if I ever got one, it would be a 14' tinny.  Not sure what else has a wagon in my price range besides a Ford, Mazda and Subaru."
531222,GBW,2010-12-23 04:41:00,8460,"I have a 2006 Impreza Sport wagon with a 5-spd tranny and over 105K on it and it still run's like a top.  hell, I can still chirp ALL the wheels going into 3rd gear if I am going hard.  I have had Toyota's, Nissan's, Ford's, Mazda's and Dodge's all before my Subaru and the Subaru is on TOP of my list for next brand I buy.  The sad part for me is I now need a Flex to replace my Grand CV because of the seating capicaty.  But if I can keep a Subaru in my driveway I sure as hell will."
