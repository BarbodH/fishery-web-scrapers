Ice is solid at the end of the access road but there is open water off of Saskins point and Friday point which takes you out to the big water (hub). The air boat was a neat experiance. We were in water more then on snow but they keep following the same route which will become their ice road. Apparently keeping it broken up will actually allow it to freeze better.    Here are some ice pics of the bay at the Mine launch.                      I didn't drill and holes but my guess was a solid 8"" at leats. Chucks in the open water were at least 5"" thick.    Now some pics of the air boat. It was new to the reserve last year and on my trip there the hour meter on the engine was only 29 hrs. Still that is quite a few 15 minute trips.            "
