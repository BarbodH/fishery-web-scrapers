530497,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-21 04:16:00,0," First? I did not edit my first comment. It still stands.  And I said what I had to say in an email to you already. I'm more brighter then you or your Tennesee guy will ever be.  Oh oh the business men and the greasy Americvans are ganging up on me!lol  Yes. I was going to comment on Hockey and take my leave of absence Azulu. Maybe until next year, when I troll for walleyes at Waubashene from Machedash to Georgian bay."

529671,Old Man,2010-12-17 23:25:00,822,"Looks like it was an old Taylorcraft BC-12, so the duct tape was probably a good sub for the fabric."
529685,Twocoda,2010-12-18 00:27:00,4130,one sigle layer of duct tape can withstand 60# of down pressure....so if you weigh a 180 pounds and stand on a three layer piece of duct tape ...it will not break...  now you have the silly facts of the Mythbusters...arent we all special now!!!  gotta run so i can catch up to the short bus....that left without me ...stoopid idiot bus driver...

Don't you know that if it's moves and it's not suppose to you Duct tape it......and if it doesn't move and it suppose to move you WD-40 it......since my son told me this I threw out everyone one of my tools and purchased a lot of Duct tape and WD-40..."
530100,Roy,2010-12-19 18:07:00,13728,"If it moves and it startles me, I use a hammer."
530101,mercman,2010-12-19 18:09:00,7054," Give a man a few rolls of duct tape,a can of WD40, and a Pop Riveter, and he can survive for months, nay, years, in the wild, Bob,......my little Americain buddy !!!"
