530419,strik,2010-12-21 00:59:00,175,Hey Guys/Girls Just wondering if i should use sea foam on my truck 310k`s never used anything on it  also what's the best way to use it? I have a Jiffy Ice 3 hp augger and  was thinking about using sea foam on it. I have been  told the float is sticking. I have noticed gas is coming out of the exaust. If i was to use sea foam do i just add it to the gas?  Reason i ask ... I have been told that if you havent used it before it can acctually do damage to the engine Thanks to all for you input  Strik

530577,bigbuck,2010-12-21 15:45:00,2449, $11.99 at PartSource. I picked up a can and ran it through my 4.0 Aurora.
530581,walleyejack,2010-12-21 15:51:00,358, yup... PartsSource is owned by Canadian Tire
530896,Fish4Eyes,2010-12-22 14:11:00,1022,I payed $14.xx with tax for a can at NAPA last weekend. Noticing every year they keep raising the price
529599,spooner_jr,2010-12-17 20:39:00,193,"Went down to the local Canadian Tire to pick up some fuel stabilizer and saw they now sell Seafoam.  It was $11 and change for 473ml.  Sign on the shelf said ""best price in town"", but I haven't found anywhere else in town that sells it, so that may explain the sign."
529601,walleyejack,2010-12-17 20:42:00,358, NAPA $13.29 and CarQuest $11.43 so i guess it is the best price in town
529607,dok,2010-12-17 20:55:00,8,Impact auto also carries it not sure of price but worth it.
529655,Old Man,2010-12-17 22:38:00,822,"Not sure if it's the best price, but it's very competitive. I'd buy it at that price."
529658,Roy,2010-12-17 22:48:00,13728,"Does anyone know if the stuff has a shelf life? Ok OK, I'll go look it up."
529693,aplumma,2010-12-18 00:53:00,6896,I could not find an answer on the web Roy but I sent an Email to their tech department I will post their answer as soon as I get it.  Art
529717,danc,2010-12-18 02:02:00,4677,"I bought some at our local NAPA a couple of months ago and if I remember correctly it was $8.99 a can. Maybe because the stuff is made in Minnesota, which is only 30 miles down the road from here?"
529769,limeyangler,2010-12-18 06:17:00,5204,"Our CT sucks, they bumped it up from $11 to $15.49 in one shot! And i'm out of the 10 cans i bought at around $6 each across the border last summer."
529770,Muskieman,2010-12-18 06:28:00,2472,"the stuff is priceless I don't care what you pay for it , it's worth it! I used to sell it for 9.49$/can  Randy "
529771,Muskieman,2010-12-18 06:30:00,2472," Actually , Roy, It didn't stay on the shelf long enough to have a life... BAM!... there it was  Gone!  Randy "
529772,grt1,2010-12-18 06:56:00,638,I picked up 2 cans in Gimli at canadian tire for 10.95 (this is what the price was in dryden when I got it last). then the other day I checked at the dryden canadian tire and like Limeyangler say it is now $15.95.
529781,blue pickeral,2010-12-18 11:00:00,267,"You can make your own....three major ingredients - kerosene, naptha gas, isopropyl alchohol - look up the percentages on the WHMIS sheet on the web site. Everybody seems to be in love with this stuff. Try Slick 50 while you're at it."
529783,Roy,2010-12-18 11:36:00,13728," You might be right but I can't see myself holding 3/4 full containers of kerosene, naptha gas and isopropyl alcohol in the garage. Sounds cost prohibitive as well."
529801,Fish Farmer,2010-12-18 14:12:00,2234,"I just put it in my snow blower. The float valve was stuck, gas kept running out the carb when stopped. I hope it works. My neighbor had the same problem, the shop gave him a kit for his carb. After he put the kit in problem solved. he saved the old parts because nothing looked wrong with them, the needle valve was stuck. probably gummed up. I hope this stuff does the trick."
529802,skeeter,2010-12-18 14:25:00,1907,"fishfarmer: if you have never used seafoam before, let me give you a pointer. do NOT start your snowblower while it is in the garage. if you used it properly, it will smoke like a bugger when you first start it for about 15 seconds. smoke so thick you wont be able to see thru it...LOL but thats good, then you know it cleaned out the engine."
529806,Fish Farmer,2010-12-18 14:35:00,2234,"Thanks for the heads up skeeter. I put it in the gas then started it, ran it for a few Min's. then left it to set for a few days. I haven't tried it yet but I'll be taking it outside. Thanks skeeter"
529807,aplumma,2010-12-18 14:39:00,6896,Check around Seafoam is also available in the Gallon container here in the USA it is $7.99 per PINT or 49.99 per Gallon or 8 pints. Something to add to your over the border trips maybe.  Art
529830,Jer,2010-12-18 15:55:00,1426,  So I can buy 4 quarts for $31.96 or a gallon for $49.99? Something wrong with the math...
529883,aplumma,2010-12-18 18:24:00,6896, My bad it's 16 oz or 1/2 quart or per pint. for $7.99. Yall were smart you went metric at least it makes sense based on the 100 VS the 16.  Art
529885,fish_fishburn,2010-12-18 18:30:00,1311,I just bought a can here at my local napa for 8.99. Think I will go and get a few more cans at that price.
530037,chuck,2010-12-19 12:23:00,7,At 8.99 that seems to be a great price.
530248,Billy Bob,2010-12-20 12:13:00,5865,"Don't purchase too much....friend told me Super Sea Foam is about to hit the market soon...  Bob, not Billy"

530356,aplumma,2010-12-20 20:52:00,6896,"Hey Roy here is your answer.   Art As long as Sea Foam is sealed or capped, to keep contamination out, it has an unlimited shelf life because Sea Foam is a pure petroleum blend with no chemical additives.
