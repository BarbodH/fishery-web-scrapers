529394,Leecher,2010-12-17 04:06:00,7832," After reading Bunk's reply above, well I just could not resist I did not get much fishing in this year but did get quite a lot accomplished at home.... stuff that I had put on the back burner for a couple of years.  Suffice to say that this year, it needed to be done.  From roof repairs to windows painting and driveway patching etc and the list goes on.... did manage to get a lot done  So I put this little video together for you guys to watch and will let the slide show (pics) speak for itself  Enjoy!

529440,bigugli,2010-12-17 13:33:00,6138,Some years everything else just has to  get in the way. At least you got some quality time in. My year kinda went the same direction. Too many other things happening to leave time for fishing.  You have a lot of talent my friend. It's good to put it to use.
