""Spud"" was an 11 month to 18 month old stray picked up by the humane society, who is fixed, and up to date on all his shots, with a clean bill of health and well socialized with Children, other dogs, and Cats, and is well trained. Answers to sit, lay down, stay, heal, and wait. He shakes a paw, and is incredibly obedient! Great family pet in the making!  And the Hunter in me ""might"" be just a tad excited that he's a well trained BEAGLE  It really feels like Christmas this year, knowing the Kids are going to be over the moon excited, plus... I have a new buddy to enjoy the outdoors with this year. Its even more sweet knowing there is one less stray that will be spending Christmas in a pen. No better way to get into the Spirit of Christmas, then giving a new home to needy Stray  Introducing Spuddy   Cheers"
