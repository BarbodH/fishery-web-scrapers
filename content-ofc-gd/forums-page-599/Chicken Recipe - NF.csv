I think it was sturgman  Well Saturday, it came to mind and had an idea, bought some pieces of chicken and marinated it in milk    Simple recipe really.... 3 cups of milk, one oignon chopped, couple branch of celery chopped, minced garlic, salt and pepper to taste.  Place all ingredients in a cooking container and cover with saran wrap and store container in fridge for 24 hours.... flip chicken 5 or 6 times max.  Here's a pic after I had drained the milk just before putting it into the oven    A little pepper for flavor    Cover the container with foil and into the oven for an hour at 250 degrees....  Got the tatters ready and mashed      Remove foil for the last 30 minutes    and the serve    Enjoy Leechman"
