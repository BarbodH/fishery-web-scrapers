530129,ripsomelips,2010-12-19 21:39:00,51,"Hi All,  Wondering how much is this boat worth as is? Includes trailer, boat and motor.  "
530130,ripsomelips,2010-12-19 21:41:00,51,
530131,ripsomelips,2010-12-19 21:43:00,51,Here is the motor 
530132,misfish,2010-12-19 21:45:00,29133,Depending on what the buyer is looking for.  1200 to 1500 IMO
530135,Bernie,2010-12-19 22:13:00,3190,How much gas is in it?
530139,SmokestackLightnin,2010-12-19 22:15:00,390,What Bernie said.....the trailer has value but that's it.  
530140,SlowPoke,2010-12-19 22:22:00,2984," That might be a little harsh but not far off. I think the value in this package is in the trailer and if I was looking for a small closed bow fiberglass tri-hull with a boat anchor for a motor, I'd pay $600-$800 tops. It's not that it won't get you out on the water and might be a decent boat for someone but there's no value in anything sitting above the bunks on the trailer."
530141,Billy Bob,2010-12-19 22:25:00,5865,"Take anything over a thousand and thank your blessings..  It's Bob, not Billy"
530142,Bernie,2010-12-19 22:27:00,3190,"Sorry, should have added in the value of the trailer. Slowpoke has it right."
530144,Raf,2010-12-19 22:42:00,3495,"if you are buying, keep looking  if you are selling, good luck"
530145,lookinforwalleye,2010-12-19 22:50:00,4399,tough crowd!  1K tops.
530146,glen,2010-12-19 22:52:00,2641,I had a boat like that once.  I didn't have it for long because it was too hard to fish out of.  From the pics. Trailer $600 Boat $0 Motor $400
530147,camillj,2010-12-19 22:54:00,1988,"ahhh .. reminds me of my old 'Humber' ... got many good years (and hundereds of Lake Ontario salmon/Trout) out of her before letting her go with 4 walker downriggers, Raytheon paper graph, cb/antenna and trailer for $1200 ... about 18 years ago  But its worth whatever someone will pay"
530164,Terry,2010-12-19 23:59:00,14456,600 for the trailer and 250 for the motor  and pay the guy 50 bucks to take the boat when he takes the trailer
530165,irishfield,2010-12-20 00:04:00,26272,Are you buying or selling????  Was the boat in a fishing tourney.. or is that Lot # 99 from a recent auction.. like in the summer time based on the green grass.  I'm with Bernie though.. gas on board + $450 for the trailer for a wholesale buy.
530186,POLLIWOGG,2010-12-20 00:56:00,835,"Not much of a market for old glass boats around here.  You don't tell us the make of the boat or condition but it looks good and they didn't cheap out on the windshield and railing. Tri hulls have a bad rep, but that's not a tri hull and the extra flotation makes for a safer boat. an old force with power trim that's running should be worth something and maybe more when its the only one left.  But there's not a great market for these so its worth what you paid for it or what you'll sell it for as you set the market."
530199,Fish Farmer,2010-12-20 01:25:00,2234,"Trailer maybe a couple hundred bucks, Scrap price for the aluminum railing. Disposal of the boat and motor will be more than what you'll get.. Run, don't buy it. If your sellin, tell the guy your at your own risk. I wouldn't want anyone to get stranded 2 miles off shore on Erie with a storm moving in. Might be alright for a small lake were you can paddle to shore."
530234,bassassin,2010-12-20 03:55:00,152,1200-1500 but take 1k if its offered!
530269,Uncle Buck,2010-12-20 14:37:00,1000,Raf said it best!!
530289,raysfish2005,2010-12-20 15:56:00,163,Hey Raf...Not to rub it in.....but your looking for a motor right?
530476,bassassin,2010-12-21 03:14:00,152,i sold a early 70's crestliner with a home made trailer and a 72 johnson for $1200 last march. You will be surprised how spring gives people rose-coloured glasses when it comes to buying a boat.
