530585,Terry,2010-12-21 15:58:00,14456,that's what I thought when I first saw it coming across the screen
530339,Terry,2010-12-20 20:06:00,14456,"went to Gilford to check out the ice conditions lots of ice everywhere I check and lots of people out fishing so loaded up the toboggan and off I went I am out of shape and found walking with the big boots pulling the toboggan hard going but I got out a ways drilled a hole and was only 10ft deep, so a quick rest and eastward I go....18ft this time next stop 20 ft and that was enough walking for me I set up the camera and the fishfinder and a couple of rods and my chair..... I wasn't marking any fish so I put a bigger spoon on with a small dropper jig and a 1"" gulp minnow and I was able to draw some perch in but by the time I reeled in a fish the small group of fish I drew in would leave and I would need to do some more big jigging with the spoon to get them back.. fishing was slow but didn't feel like moving deeper I had trouble with the camera not a real clear picture and the monitor was worst then the recorded video, so it was hard for me to see that was happening the perch took off fast and some surprise visitors showed up 	(it wouldn't be a surprise to Joey, she would just catch them) caught a bunch of perch let them all go, I will get a feed of them another day then I had the long walk in ..it's a lot longer walk in then the walk out.. here is a couple of minutes of video....perch and the surprise fish   <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvid25.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fc52%2FMrbeee1954%2Fperch2010-2011.mp4"">  [media][/media]"

530347,toca,2010-12-20 20:19:00,274,ARGHHHH DAMN THIS STUPID BROKEN ANKLE.......  btw terry very nice cant wait till next year to hit the ice with my gear(at least next year they will be brand new)  would have been nice to catch one of those eh?
530348,Jds63,2010-12-20 20:22:00,1365,"very nice, was that carp there at the end of the video ?"
530350,Terry,2010-12-20 20:24:00,14456,oh yeah  there were hundreds of them over a 4 hour period some were monsters ..the carp crusaders
530352,kickingfrog,2010-12-20 20:29:00,8333,You better stay off of joey's carp.
530353,Terry,2010-12-20 20:38:00,14456,I think it's about the same spot where she caught her big carp through the ice....  I will now be able to guide her to some more of them...LOL
530354,bassman87,2010-12-20 20:47:00,586,lol at the carps roaming around like its nobody's business
530385,Leecher,2010-12-20 23:07:00,7832,Awesome report pics and video Terry Maybe the surprise visitors spooked the perch away Sounds like you had a good time including the trekking part Thanks for sharing Leechman
530392,lunkerbasshunter,2010-12-20 23:33:00,2585,awesome video!  Imagine hooking into one of those big carps with your 4 little ice rod and ice line lol what a ride it would be if it didnt break off!  (do carp have a season)  Cheers!
530393,Terry,2010-12-20 23:39:00,14456,"the carp did scare away the perch, everytime the carp showed up the perch ran like hell I guess the walking is good for me   there is no season on carp, so corn and away you go it sure would be fun hooking them but I would need to cut a bigger hole"
530407,Rod Caster,2010-12-21 00:17:00,5784,Cool fish tv and good song.  
530420,skeeter,2010-12-21 01:01:00,1907,what do you mean you would have to cut a bigger hole Terry? i thought you were the seasoned veteran at how to pull a 25LB carp out of a 7 ince hole?---
530422,Joey,2010-12-21 01:08:00,9122,"Wow, really cool video Terry.  What are you doing harrassing my carp  I am surprised they hang out together like that, never would have thought of them a a ""social"" fish, but I guess you learn something new every day  Well I'm glad you braved it first, now we can make some serious weekend Simcoe plans  Thanks Terry.  Joey"
530423,Terry,2010-12-21 01:08:00,14456,"LOL no when they are that big, Tybo pulls them through the hole and a fine job he does too"
530426,skeeter,2010-12-21 01:24:00,1907,"I stand corrected ,thank you Terry. now i remember that it was tybo telling me the details of how it went. i almost pissed myself when he was telling me. "
530430,Terry,2010-12-21 01:33:00,14456,yeah I was there when it happened  I felt bad for the carp  but it really was a sight to see
530453,Aaron Shirley,2010-12-21 02:31:00,655,"Cool vid Terry. Good to know the ice is safe out there already. Would be pretty cool to target those carp through the ice for sure. Definitley different.  A question, where did you get the soft case for the HDS5? I haven't been able to find one for mine. Did it come with an ice transducer?  Thanks,  Aaron "
530457,discophish,2010-12-21 02:38:00,392,"The carp aren't in any rush to get anywhere, are they.  Awesome video. Thanks for sharing this glance of hope to get out soon.  Great day on the ice."
