(this bucket was honestly probably 7 pounds.. no smaller then 6.. this was a nice fish..  i look at the guy as hes now in aw..  next thing i no the fish is still splashin around and fighting like a train.. and im starting to get more spectators.. Then It Happend !  SNAP !  the fish jumped and snapped my line.. this thing was large .. and what caught me off guard was that a few of the guys came over and actually thanked me for the show, and showing them that there is still fish in the lake..  after that .. i packed it in.. for now atleast .. gotta go buy some new line haha  but just thought Id share my day..  -A fellow fishermen"
372923,BillM,2009-08-15 19:57:00,17367,Time to loosen that drag a bit.
372924,taildancer66,2009-08-15 19:59:00,2,it's a terrible feeling isnt it and costly lesson to learn. i change my line every year for that reason.
372925,e-z-out,2009-08-15 19:59:00,1052,Great story i wish i had seen that.
372933,fish-miester,2009-08-15 20:29:00,864,ya . guess im just used to 50lb power pro and my revo stx drag being able to pull out what ever i want lol.. but its just that i hadnt changed that set up in probably a month.. and well i use it all the time..  oh well .. guess i'll just have to go get her tomorrow..
372935,ciceri,2009-08-15 20:32:00,535,"God I hate when that happens.. I had this huge musky on a couple years ago on a Jointed Rapala in Clown color, I got it while trolling and it was waaay out there, and it jumped and pulled its head while in the air and snapped my line, I was so mad, not only cause it got away, but it also got my best lure I had ever used. Now I can't find jointed Rapalas in that color anywhere... Does anyone know where I could get them in the color called Clown by chance?"
372938,Paully,2009-08-15 20:45:00,712,If Clown is a red head with a white body i dont think they make them anymore.. But i could be wrong.
372942,Syn,2009-08-15 21:09:00,519,Did you google it and check ebay?  eg http://setthehook.com/jointedXrap.htm
372973,Greencoachdog,2009-08-16 00:10:00,8163,Fishing with rotten line is never good!
372997,ciceri,2009-08-16 01:40:00,535," Yea, and it has a bit of green on it.. I had found mine floating in the river, so I changed the hooks and it was a fish magnet.   No, I just looked in tackle stores. I don't have a credit card or check book. Maybe I'll have to get my mom to help me out.  And thats what they look like, but in the Orignal Jointed Rapala J-11. What's the shallowest running Jointed X-Rap?"
373017,Cudz,2009-08-16 03:16:00,2652,That sucks about your fish. I lost a Donkey this week as well. Probably close to 5 pounds because I forgot my net.  Not to hijack this thread but it looks like this guy has the j-11 clown.  Great prices as well.
