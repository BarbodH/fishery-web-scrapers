Managed to boat 1 sheephead, off the torpedo diver and nitro spoon, and then lost something else that we never saw.  Later in the day we lost a monster bow at boatside from the inline planer and a reef runner. Kinda sucks when the commercial net guys are in all your good spots,  All the charters boats were out way further than we were today.  (us 60-68 FOW Them another 2-3 miles out)   jjcanoe"
