372513,Familyfisherman,2009-08-14 00:30:00,188," I'm taking a client fishing next week and thought about trying the Niagara River for bass.  I had planned to launch out of Queenston.  A friend had suggested going upriver to the power station on the right and fish the shoreline just north of the station...the advice was to try 3-way rigs, drop shots and tubes...just wondering if we're on the right track here, or if anyone had any suggestions to improve our results.  I'm from Barrie, client is in Stoney Creek.  Is it worth the drive down to Queenston?  Appreciate your help. Thanks in advance.  Kevin"

Theres no need to go up river there are tons of spots all the way down on the canadian side right out to the bar that have great quality bass.  This time of the year the water is super clear and bright colours will work great, good luck and be careful out there."
372540,Familyfisherman,2009-08-14 01:32:00,188,"I will take that advice paze and appreciate it.  Are we on the right track lure-wise with 3-ways, drop shots and tubes? Honestly I'm not much of a bass fisherman but my client ""thinks"" he is  I have no experience on the river so we'll go downriver as suggested."
