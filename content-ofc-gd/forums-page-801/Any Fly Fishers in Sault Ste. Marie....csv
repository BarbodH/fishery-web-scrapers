I'm a Novice Fly Fisherman (Just over one year experience) and I will be in SSM on Tuesday the 25th on (Monkey) Business.  I should arrive late afternoon/evening and was looking to hook up with another Fly Fisher for a couple of hours fishing.  I'll have my own vehicle and I'll be packing my waders for the trip.  I don't mind a little travel to the destination.  Please let me know if you're interested.  Thanks."
373246,Parisite,2009-08-16 23:21:00,66,OK...No takers.  Any recommendations from a Sault Ste. Marie resident to a visitor with limited time for exploration?  All help is greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

There are resident rainbows in there and Atlantics right now. Park at the locks and walk across the gates (legal walkway) and follow the trails to the rapids. Its worth it just to be there."
