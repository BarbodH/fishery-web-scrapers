Forgot the digital camera, but as it turns out there weren't any fish photo ops to be had today anyhow...  Took the grand daughter out in the Sportspal with me and I tried my best to have her get a nibble but to no avail.  I anchored just off the small rocky island and set her up with a wacky rigged Gulp natural crawler, usually a sure bet to get some kind of bite, nada.  Had fish marking on the sonar, but guess they weren't in the mood...lol.  Trolled around a bit with a Blue Fox #3 and a jointed Rapala balsa bait, both on a Carolina set up to get them down a bit further...went around the small island and along some shoreline in the 12-15 foot depths, but no luck at all.  Ah well, it is after all called fishing...not catching...."
