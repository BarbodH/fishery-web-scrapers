Argyle Lake is in Matachewan, Ontario. Just west of Kirkland Lake (about 45 mins).  Has anyone ever fished this lake? The lake has Pike, Pickerel, Smallies and Perch.  Any tips on fishing the lake or any information is much appreciated.  Or any info about the actual lodge.  Also if anyone has any info on any lakes/rivers/creeks in that area of Ontario, I'm all ears.  I'd be willing to drive and explore the area if I can get into some native trout or some nice little lakes. Thanks for the info.  Peace"

The fishing was ok, lots of water to explore and other parties were doing better than ours. I'd consider switching to Horseshoe if you could. I just worry that a lake that size, gets that many fisherman keeping fish, might make it tough fishing. But what do I know, Argyle could be great."

I'll be around the Matachewan Kirland Lake, Gowagana, Gogama, Shining Tree area... Any info wold be much appreciated... Thanks Peace"

Bust GoogleMaps, Virtual Earth SDK, or the Atlas of Canada Topo website...anything that you can access should be not bad...and anything you have to bust your butt to get into should be golden."

Haven't fished them much, but last May run we were fishing from shore and managed to get a 32.5"" pickeral on Big Elmer.  Supposedly, there are a number of big lakers in there too.  Might be worth the short trip."

Caught Pike, Pickerel and Smallies. Caught a PB smallie at 4 lbs. All in all a great relaxing week. If you're looking for a place to fish, swim, relax, this is it and its quite affordable too! Peace"
