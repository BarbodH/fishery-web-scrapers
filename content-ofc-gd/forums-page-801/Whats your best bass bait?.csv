372613,muddler,2009-08-14 11:44:00,623,"My favourite is a Chug Bug. It works wonders on both SM and LM bass on the surface.  Get a couple of pike that nail it too.  For subsurface I use tubes for SM and plastic worm for LM. For waters that have a lot of movement (rivers , creeks, causways) I really like a 3"" pinky (yes I know it's a steelhead bait). My kids love using this on a 1/16 jig head under a slip float. Seems to catch just about everything.  muddler"

372912,Cudz,2009-08-15 18:42:00,2652,"Like Jacques and Radnine said.  Senko or similar stick bait.  Rigged wacky with a 2/0 or 3/0 octopus hook will work wonders. Crankbaits, I have to go with a Big-0."
372916,JoshS,2009-08-15 19:03:00,729,"All round, I think depending on the waters the senko style bait will get the most bites from both species.  If it's smallies you're after than the tube works great, as does dropshotting baits like 4 in senko's, gulp minnows etc.  But if you're tired of catching 10 dinks to one hog than pitching the jig produces.  If conditions are right, can't beat a spook. Windy cloudy days on a good smallie lake, burning baits like a white spinnerbait can be killer.  Twitchbaits when its cool.  Thats pretty much my general rule of thumb."

372940,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-15 20:49:00,0,"i can't say i have a ""go to"" lure for bass, it has more to do with particular lakes or conditions.  for example, nothing outfishes a white mister twister on the one lake i fish, where others i'd be more inclined to fish a tube...  years ago, troutologist taught me a lesson:  never leave home without a jitterbug.   i fished every spook, torpedo, frog etc. that i had in my topwater arsenal...all the while i watched trouty slay SMB's...."
372464,Lunatic,2009-08-13 22:01:00,536,"Im going to the tackle shop tomorrow,to possibly pick up another frog. and possible 1 or 2 other baits. im thinking maybe a spook or a hula popper or maybe a new pack of firetail worms? what are some of your all around favourite bass lures and colours? looking for some new ideas. they didnt have the colour frog i wanted last on sunday,so i bought one they highly recomended and got skunked. which happens.  so.......lets hear it, what to get!?"
372477,dave524,2009-08-13 22:29:00,4508,"here's an old one that still works very well for bouncing off structure and won't break the bank, I have excellent success with the Blakemore Roadrunner for smallies, get the black maribou/chenille one and also the white plastic curly tail to start, 1/8 and 1/4 oz.

372480,JohnF,2009-08-13 22:41:00,3494,"My buddy Rob has been fishing smb's for over 50 years, and though he's kinda stuck in a time warp, he catches the durned things, and he uses dime store rods and reels to boot. I talked him into buying a nice spinning setup and he ended up giving it to me for a $24.95 Gander Mtn rig I had and didn't use. He loves it. I'm happy with the trade.  His favourite lure is the original grey Rapala minnow twitched and rested on the surface and he catches lotsa bass with it, and pike, at least the ones that don't bite him off. He sacrifices half a dozen of those lures to the fishing gods every season becuz he hates leaders and just doesn't get what fluoro's about. If he isn't using those he uses live worms. We fish shallow creeks.  JF"

Picked one up in a tackle box from ebay and it was awesome.  Been two seasons now and I just can't keep the bass off of them.  Great bait, nest robber is the best color for me in the Kawartha's but my buddy uses a deep diver in a different color and catches lots of fish up around Buckhorn.  It's proven to work all over, I used to use them all the time in the Greenbrier and New Rivers in West Virginia - they are a real go to bait for me."
