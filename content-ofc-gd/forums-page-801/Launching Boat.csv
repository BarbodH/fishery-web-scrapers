365668,skeeter,2009-07-24 01:08:00,1907,the problem is that the parking pin in a transmission is about the same size as the lead in a pencil. thats 1 of the reasons you should always use your parking brake.. even if your just checking out the ramp. with or without a trailer on . another reason is so it works when you really need it to  i wonder if his wife told him to keep her truck clean !!!
