So Im guessing I need a new chip for this area and the routes to GBay.  The ride back was awesome. 2+ waves coming from the south, and the boat was full out and it was a great ride. When we hit the mouth of Kempenfelt,it was glass. Oh BTW,LOTS of down rigging going on out there. Most I seen in years."

372962,Guest skeeter99,2009-08-15 23:24:00,0,no satellite readings means your unit might be toast  you should still get a reading regardless of what chip is in the unit
372964,misfish,2009-08-15 23:30:00,29133,"It came up as a wall on the screen. It,s not toast.It worked fine til there.  It,s a Garmin 178c sounder. The chip in it right now isLake ont to Montrel."
