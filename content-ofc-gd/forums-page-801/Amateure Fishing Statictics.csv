So I caught, weighed and released many fish and filled in the blanks. I just added it to my report at the end and I'm going to add it here.I would suggest doing something like this, I will for now on. It helps to get a better feel for the fishery and well you can look back at your success over the years.Link http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...c=35153&hl=Thanks for the viewing,MTBFO and btw the Average on my map said 1-2lbs"
373102,splashhopper,2009-08-16 15:03:00,2931,"great idea.... maybe add the bait and weather too  If you are this organized for fishing, can you get my tackle bag straightened out too"
373111,Burning Babies,2009-08-16 15:16:00,150,"Yeah, I would definately add a few more categories.  I started keeping a detailed log this year, with one trip entry page (describing the date, water body, general weather and water temp conditions, etc.) and a second page discussing specifics for each fish caught (depth, water temp, location specifics linked to a map, lure, retrieve, etc).  I expect that in a few years, it should be very useful in anticipating seasonal patterns."
