369443,Cudz,2009-08-04 15:44:00,2652,I oredered my lures on the 27th of July.  They were sent on the 28th and I received them today.  NO EXTRA CHARGES and my shipping was $3.50 and that was for 4 lures.  My buddy ordered 8 lures and was charged the same. Great service and great prices.  (I have no affiliation with this shop other than the fact that I bought some tackle from it) http://www.toplakstackle.com/ give it a try.  It is hard to get bandit lures here in Canada.
369461,TC1OZ,2009-08-04 16:59:00,987,cool! will check it out when I'm running low
369467,bigzinc10,2009-08-04 17:15:00,38,cool. I'm goona buy some right now. The transaction is via paypal right??
369483,Jonny,2009-08-04 18:33:00,1380,"I ordered two buzzbaits and a Bandit 200. Reasonable prices and shipping.  I'm sure the transaction will be fine.  Thanks for the link, Cudz!"
369600,Cudz,2009-08-05 01:11:00,2652,I used credit card but I am sure he accepts paypal
372189,Jonny,2009-08-13 01:02:00,1380,"Got my order today - well-packed, timely shipping, $13.50 total (no extra charges).  Boy, those Boo-yah buzzbaits are a lot bigger than I expected them to be!  Should be fun to try."
372227,Who Da Man,2009-08-13 02:20:00,21,Just curious if you had to pay any duty charges at the post office?  Also the website says $3.50 shipping in the U.S. Is that how much you paid to Canada as well?  Thanks
372256,Jonny,2009-08-13 03:10:00,1380,"No duty charges. The parcel came ""no strings attached"" same as it would have from a Canadian retailer.  The shipping for Canada is the same as for the USA."
372303,bigzinc10,2009-08-13 12:44:00,38,I ordered a buzzbait as well with a bandit 200.  Still waiting for my package to arrive. Out of curiosity how long did it take for you to receive your order? My order was confirmed on Aug 6. They said international shipping via USPS to canada would take about 7 days......at least thats what they have been hearing from their Canadian customers.  
372314,Jonny,2009-08-13 13:08:00,1380,"Ordered Aug 4, received Aug 12.  The silver triangle just above the ""hookup"" is, I assume, a noisemaker for when the blade spins? I've never fished these before. "
372322,Lunker777,2009-08-13 13:53:00,866," Your right ! Its a ""Clacker"" .... it makes quite a sound when your bringing it in !  Those are the ones I have and used for the last 2 1/2 years. I actually have those EXACT ones in my box ! haha  Good product !"
372330,bigzinc10,2009-08-13 14:15:00,38,Thnaks for the pic. I have not used them before either. Should be interesting.  That means I will prob get my ordr by end of the week then.  
372331,Jonny,2009-08-13 14:16:00,1380,"Thanks, Lunker. I'm looking forward to taking them for a ""spin""."
372348,mepps,2009-08-13 15:20:00,1301,"Nice, the x-raps are a good price too!"
372354,Harrison,2009-08-13 15:37:00,2202," Depends on how they mark the parcel i.e. ""Gift"" or ""lesser value"" .  I order alot from the US, some get by, some do not.  It only takes a few packages through customs from them before they get flagged if they mark the customs tags like above.  Soon enough there will be a 100% Canadian ecommerce site where ""duty"" suprises won't be an issue.  Including Bandit baits and other hard to find stuff, run by those in the know....."
372366,Jonny,2009-08-13 16:11:00,1380,"There's always the chance of being charged extra, I guess. I've ordered dozens of things from the States and overseas, mostly through ebay. Some were marked as a gift, most were not, almost all were marked with the full price paid. Still, I have never had to pay extra charges, not even once.  This is what this package looked like... "
372379,Harrison,2009-08-13 17:16:00,2202,"You've been fortunate depending on the true value of the items you are importing.  It's hit and miss.  I have shipped and recieved packages into the thousands now and always mark truthfully and ask the ones I import to be aswell.  As long as you learn the import amounts allowed and stay with-in them your ok.  I have had customs open a few packages marked sample/other  etc..  and assess an estimated value to it.   Along with the duty/taxes.  They re-seal it with yellow tape along with a letter explaining there actions.  I am sure there is a way to appeal, but for the amount of times and money it's happened, I've never looked into it."
373025,Cudz,2009-08-16 03:34:00,2652,I just got a second shipment of 4 lures today and again there was no additional charge.  Took 1 week to get here.  $3.50 is the cost and it looks like there aren't any extra charges under $40.
