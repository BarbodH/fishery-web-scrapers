372914,Scott S,2009-08-15 19:02:00,203,"I just recently purchased a new boat(to me). It's 16 ft crestliner fish hawk. What's the best way to mount downrigging plates. My side gunnels are not very wide. Would it be better to have a board all the way across? If so whats the best way to mount it, and I want it removable. Any info appreciated Thanks Scooter"

Try steel-heading in a ditch somewhere (""tribs"" I think they call them). Good luck! Jim  God carries this photo in his wallet  "
372974,Scott S,2009-08-16 00:11:00,203,I'm not sure but I think you might need some help Scooter

373048,JohnAB,2009-08-16 11:47:00,178,"Have to agree with Radnine, that is the boat, in fact looks just like mine!"
373058,Radnine,2009-08-16 12:47:00,1538, Good call! You're right I do need help - I've got this white stuff from dock bumpers smudged on the side of the boat that I can't get off - any thoughts? Jim
373070,Scott S,2009-08-16 13:31:00,203,"I use spray nine for everything. Not sure if you have tried this, but it's worth a try. Let me know how you make out getting it off. Scooter"
373115,Mike the Pike,2009-08-16 15:33:00,3421, Ya if only it had a tiller
373144,Pigeontroller,2009-08-16 18:00:00,2793,"Wow, there should be a fine for doing that to a thread...   I made my own transome board, Big Jon makes one you can buy. I fasten it using 2 U-bolts through the mooring cleats on the inside of the gunnels.     "
373172,Scott S,2009-08-16 20:22:00,203,Thanks Pigeontroller!! I didn't really want to drill any holes. Don't no why I couldn't have thought of that. I have a nice piece of alluminum that would work perfect. Thanks again Scooter
