372709,Syn,2009-08-14 17:23:00,519,"Wondering what Cowgirl colour combo to get for Georgian bay muskies?  At $20+ a pop I want to pick a good colour combo. They offer so many colours but I'm just starting with muskie hunting. I'm liking the red/black but I've been having success with blue/black smaller spinnerbaits lately.    Help me ""choose wisely"".  "
372710,oxcowboy,2009-08-14 17:32:00,544,"i prefer blonde's with some dark roots myself, but im not that picky!  sorry i couldnt resist.  i wish i could be of some help, but im not much of a musky man.  jason"
372715,Guest gbfisher,2009-08-14 18:03:00,0,Start with something you think that you will be confident with.  At 20 a pop....yer just starting.....
372720,Syn,2009-08-14 18:29:00,519," Blondes is always a good answer!   Are you saying ""use the force"" like in star wars Ben talking to Luke and that Cowgirl colour does not really matter, I just have to focus on proper lure presentation and fish the lure confidently, muskie are not too picky? or are you saying ""I can only show you the door"" like in the matrix Morpheius talking to Neo meaning that I have to create my own path to lure selection though trial and error.    j/k friday afternoon boredom."
372733,Guest gbfisher,2009-08-14 19:16:00,0,Wrong movies. Same ideas.
372734,Syn,2009-08-14 19:23:00,519,So I should be like Tuco from the good the bad and the ugly and build a lure from different parts like he did in the gun shop?    Anyhow I just got a red/black one with a flourocarbon leader.
372737,Rich Clemens,2009-08-14 19:28:00,3131,"I picked up two last year.  1).  Red. 2).  Red and Black.  But, I didn't have much action on them so far this year. Should be good colors though.  (At least I hope they are)."
372739,mistaredone,2009-08-14 19:32:00,913,A musky is a musky no matter what body of water your on. Pick colours with water colour and light conditions in mind
372743,Syn,2009-08-14 19:39:00,519,"yes, that's what I do with other fish. I don't have much experience with muskie so I thought I'd double check colours with you guys. I guess a fish is a fish. Red and black for me. I have other skirts to mix and match anyhow."
372751,Rizzo,2009-08-14 20:24:00,4754,any 2 colours are fine (assuming those 2 colours are black and orange)
372767,Handlebarz,2009-08-14 22:03:00,3790,"I would go with contrasting colors like bright blades and dark body or white,gold or silver body with a dark blade maybe two different blade colors. I have the silver/nickle one my daughter picked it out and we have boated a couple musky on it last year."
372776,Syn,2009-08-14 22:24:00,519, Yeah I noticed that too about kids. I let my little nephew pick a few lure colours and they are top producers.
372827,mattyk,2009-08-15 01:07:00,2110,black and orange
372887,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-08-15 15:18:00,0,"Try one of Johnny Dadsons Boo Dadleys in the Stan Smyl color, these are amazing bucktails with more tinsel and hackle feathers then U can amagine, I heard the Maple Lodge Chicken truck drops off at his place all there chicken feathers before going to KFC.  I hope you have the reel to throw those babies or you will be sorry the next day"
373146,JoshS,2009-08-16 18:06:00,729,"I don't have tons of musky hours but I know you can't go wrong with black.  As well, I was throwing white a few weeks back and it was getting lots of attention"
