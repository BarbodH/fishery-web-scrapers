We decided on Couchiching and got out around 4pm for a half day charter.  It was hot and calm, but the fish were biting.  Landed 17 bass in 4 hours, here's some of the days largest.  All fish were released following photos.      Fish were caught on 5 inch flippin tubes with a 5/16oz bullet head and 3/0 Owner Riggin hook.  Milfoil beds in 8-14 feet of water."
