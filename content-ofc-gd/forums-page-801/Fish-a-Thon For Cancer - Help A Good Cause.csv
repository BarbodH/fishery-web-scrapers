370515,The Urban Fisherman,2009-08-07 18:24:00,2050,"Back from Vegas.  It was a solid 5 days of unspeakably juvenile behavior with Ginny!  A big thank you to DUTCHY for adding another OFC Pledge while I was away.  ...and another thanks to Rich for taking care of things for me while I was gone.  To show my appreciation, I'll be glad to teach you a thing or two about catching bass while we're out on the water next saturday brother!  I'll add final details for the event here on OFC by the middle of next week, and through E-mail to those who are actually participating.   James, the ""powers that be"" haven't contacted me back yet to let me know if it'll be ok.  I'll let you know for sure by tuesday.  Thanks for the pledges and support guys.  keep them comin'  Cheers, Ryan"
370521,tinbanger,2009-08-07 18:39:00,1028,Ryan as per my PM let me know if you are interested in a donation ! We can fiqure out how and when to meet up. TB
370529,GBW,2009-08-07 20:09:00,8460,"Ryan, how can I get you a prize for this?  I have a 2GB MP3 player sitting here new in the case (samsung yp-s2 in black) to donate but I'm out in the Durham area.  You going to ask Dave to drop by and pick it up as I'm not far from his home town (LmAo!)?  I'm sure I might be able to dig up another one as well (just need to look for it).  Let me know via PM when you can, cheers.  Geoff"
370560,JamesH,2009-08-07 23:45:00,2,"Well lets hope they are kind enough to allow it...its only one day and such a great cause too  Wow Ryan you resond faster here then you do black berry!  Hey Rich it will be fun to be out fished by you again, cant say I really missed that part of fishing with you...   however I still remember some of the great hints and tips I got from Sleded, fish are in water etc etc....that guy needs his own show, seriously.  I have not fished Deer Creek in the summer since I was a wee lad,  hopefully the bobber and worm technique still works.  that was always a good pattern."
371672,The Urban Fisherman,2009-08-11 16:57:00,2050," You're the man TB - I've been away since saturday for work or I would have gotten back to you sooner!  I'll shoot you a PM later in the day when I'm out of the office. Thanks again!   GBW - also the man...   Same as TB, I'll shoot you a PM later in the day.  Thank you VERY much for the offer.  OFC PLEDGE UPDATE:  A big thanks goes out to MUSKYMATT for taking the time to add another generous OFC pledge to the cause!!! Thanks for helping Matt - You're a stand up dude there's no doubt about it!  PRIZES  We've got some AWESOME prizes lined up!  A HUGE thanks goes out to Tinbanger and GBW for going out of their way to donate prizes to the event and cause.  And I especially have to thank Dave Mercer and his wife for helping me out with all of this.  Without them, I couldn't have made this happen, and they've also stepped up and donated some really awesome prizes and giveaways!  I don't want to count my chickens before they hatch, but the preliminary numbers look as though we'll be far exceeding my initial expectations for this years small event.  Let's hit this one out of the park guys!  Thanks again for the support OFC, and keep it up.  Cheers, Ryan"
371968,The Urban Fisherman,2009-08-12 13:21:00,2050,"Good Morning Folks!  The fish-a-thon is only a few days away and Pledges are still comin' in!  Thanks to my friend, and a guy who taught me a few things about video / film editing  FISHNSLED for making the latest OFC Pledge to the 2009 Fish-a-Thon to fight Cancer.  Appreciate it buddy!  Cheers, Ryan"

372457,GBW,2009-08-13 21:47:00,8460,"Just in case I cannot get the 2 MP3 players to Ryan in time, this is what they are. YP-S2QB/XAC Ryan and I are going to figure out how the winners will get these BUT you will get it.  Cheers."
372691,fishnsled,2009-08-14 16:11:00,3520,Have a great day out there tomorrow folks!    Lots of water and sunscreen will be needed by looking at the forecast.  Looking forward to hearing the results.
372698,JohnF,2009-08-14 16:25:00,3494,"And Ryan, remember the deal. If you don't boat at least 25# of bass tomorrow you're gonna moon Dave when he's just about to boat a huge one on the show. I'm sure the watching world would be hugely entertained by his reaction to that. Think of it as another first for his new show.  I'm not sure if I remembered to mention that before.  Seriously, have a great day. If I wasn't in the middle of moving I'd be there.  JF"
372782,danbouck,2009-08-14 22:33:00,4380,I've off to the cottage now. See you guys in the morning!!  BTW The pledges I received are mindblowing!!!
372788,JohnF,2009-08-14 22:56:00,3494," I'll add one more then. If you'll also moon Dave (Ryan's already doing it) on the show I'll add another $100. It's not that I personally need or want to see yer pale butt shining in the sun, rather that I think it might be seriously funny to see how Dave could figger out how to include it in the show to get the money for a good cause. I picture Dave trying to record the show with this weird guy holding a huge bass & mooning him from another boat all thru the recording session, and Dave doing his Dave thang - that crazy loony laff, only this time pointing at a pale moon rising over the gunwale of a boat floating within camera range. I can hear him now - ""OOOOO HEEEEE AAAAA WAAAA"" (or whatever the hell that noise is that passes for delighted laughter), ""There's a huge moon rising off the port bow, and it's scaring my fish. They're all dropping roe like there's no tomorrow. AHHH Haaaa Haaa"". Or something like that. Dave's a showman. He can build lotsa drama, suspense, and comedy into it, and it's fer a good cause. I'm all for finding a cure for cancer of any kind. Too much of it going around these days. And it would be a hoot to watch on tv, just to see how he handles it, and the best part is that only you and Ryan would be humiliated.  Ryan could fiddle the schedule for you so you could be hanging around at the opportune moment in the filming. This could open up a whole new genre of live fishing shows - the moonfishers. I can see it all now - Dave Mercer's Mooners Strike Again. It could be even bigger than his signature baits. Folks would watch the show, not for the fishing, but to see who would turn up nekkid next. Celebs would be lining up to moon Dave on WFN for the ""exposure'.  I like it.  JF"
372794,Rich,2009-08-14 23:15:00,3927,I think we're talking a bit too much about Ryan's bum..

Then, I started dreaming about the danged tournament around 1:00 am  It's 2:40 am now.... with a ninety minute drive ahead of us....  Sooo... maybe I will be doing a little ""pre-fishing""....  I might as well go over to the 24 hour grocery store and grab some fruits and stuff... Drive down to the tournament and have a nap at the launch..... hopefully someone will notice a little idiot sleeping in his van with a fishing rods sticking out the window and wake me up.  lol  splashhopper"
373032,danbouck,2009-08-16 04:22:00,4380,"Just got back, Soooooo tired!!!"
367762,The Urban Fisherman,2009-07-29 21:51:00,2050,"Hey Guys,  I don't believe there's a need for me to explain why doing a Fish-a-Thon for Cancer is a good cause, as unfortunately, I'm sure most of you have felt the effects of this vicious diseases in some way or another in your life.  I for one have lost to many family members to Cancer over the years, and now, it has struck our family once again.  Ginny's (my wife for those who are new around here) Grandmother has just been diagnosed with terminal Cancer.  The doctors can't do anything to help her, and have given her only a couple of months, at most to live.  She's a VERY talented artist, and a loving grandmother to say the least.  It's a shame that my children won't have the pleasure of even remembering her, as they're just to young.  Myself and Grandma Anderson partying it up last weekend.   Grandma with my kids and their cousins.   Although I can't do anything to help her out directly, this has kick-started me into organizing an event that I've wanted to do for some time.  Here's the deal.  The First Annual South Western Ontario Fish-a-Thon for Cancer. Date: August 15th, 2009 Time: 6 A.M to 6 P.M. Location: Deer Creek Conservation Area (Norfolk, County) Rules for Participants: Print off Pledge Form, get pledges from family and friends, fish for 12 hours strait, no break except for food (on the water) and washroom breaks. (if you arrive late, we can bend the rules, after all, it is a charity event, not the Bassmaster Classic) Minimum Pledge: 1 cent (because every penny counts)  The funds raised will be donated to Dave Mercer's Casting for a Cure, which will in turn be donated to the Canadian Cancer Society.  This whole thing is happening very fast because I'd like to see it become a reality before Ginny's grandmother passes away.  Hopefully we can work out the kinks this year, generate some decent donations for a good cause, and lay out the ground work for a great annual fishing event.  I'm also looking into setting up a BBQ and bonfire for a post fishing get together for the participants.  Any other ideas are welcome and PLEASE try to participate in some way if you're able to.  If you live to far away to participate as a ""Fish-a-Thoner"" and are willing and able to make a pledge to myself, please PM me, and I will be glad to ship you a pledge form to fill out along with a return shipping envelope and stamp.  Tax receipts can be issued for $20.00 pledges or more, but any pledge is top notch.  I'll leave it at that for now, ask questions, give me some pointers, make pledges, just keep this topic going because I'd like this to be more than just a few fishing bums on the water for the day.  It's a simple event, that gives us anglers a chance to help out and have fun at the same time.  I hope, if you can, you decide to participate in any way possible.  Cheers, Ryan Bonin"
367823,The Urban Fisherman,2009-07-30 01:06:00,2050,"HEY OFNER'S!! I GOT MY FIRST OFC PLEDGE, AND IT'S A BIG ONE!!!  A very special thanks goes out to a stand up OFNER, JohnF, for stepping up to the plate and getting the ball rolling!  I know time's are tough for many of us right now, but as I said, every penny counts, so please help out if you can.  Anyone who's from Southwestern Ontario, and needs a good excuse to get out fishing for the day, this is your ticket for a full day on the water!  PM me for detail about the location or anything else.  Keep 'em comin!  Thanks again for your time guys!  Ryan"

Boat size doesn't matter, no gas motors allowed though.  I know some people who work there and might be able to have them allow our Participants at least leave their motors bolted on but turned off.  Worst case scenario I can get my hands on a couple of tinny's for people who can't get their bigger rigs in.  I chose Deer Creek because it won't leave out those who only have canoes or kayaks.  I have a 15 footer and have had to miss out on days on Long Point due to weather.  There's been several 6+ pound Largies caught on Deer Creek in the past couple of weeks.  I figure it's all in fun so we can get on the cell phones and share info on catching fish so everybody has a stellar day.  Species:  Largemouth Bass Rainbow Trout Brown Trout Big Bluegill Crappie Big Carp Rock Bass Perch  I'll get some pics up of recent catches tomorrow!  Gotta put the kids to bed!  Cheers, Ryan"
