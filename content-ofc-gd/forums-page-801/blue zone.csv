372893,johnnyb,2009-08-15 15:45:00,3413,"you have to listen for all the swear words....as you get closer you'll see a distinct blue tinge in the air...  Seriously...head out about 6 or 7 clicks...into the deeeeeep water...troll 40-60 feet down...if you see fish jumping behind the boat, grab your line...you've got one on!"
372895,danada,2009-08-15 16:01:00,31,where do you head out from and what like 300 ft deep?
372897,DRIFTER_016,2009-08-15 16:30:00,10439, I used to fish it out of Pt. Credit. Run out to 260' and start trolling South to deeper water. When you find fish work the area.
372899,danada,2009-08-15 16:38:00,31,thanks i'll give it a shot.

Look for certain things when running out looking for this zone  sudden change in air temperature....if you have surface temp capabilties watch for a sudden drop ... watch for a line of debris.. this usually associated with a change in surface temp... sometimes the water will be dead flat calm one side of this thermal break and lightly rippled on the other.  What you are looking for ideally are upwellings of cooler water.  This is primarily a coho rainbow fishery with lines set  30 feet or less. I remember in the early 80's running red fireplugs off planer boards in july and early august in 360 to 400 feet of water off Port Weller, 12 to 15 miles offshore.  With the increased presence of Coho it may be worth a shot again."
