I got a smallish large mouth and then a 18"" monster ( he did get to net it and then take MY picture for a change)    Well, today I had put in my 8 hours of work by 10:30 am ( a short day for me)  and decided to hit the pond again in the float tube  Got 2 smaller ones in the 1.5lb range, a rock bass and the a pair of 19""ers. Hard to take decent photos in the float tube though           jjcanoe"

372793,Bass Tard,2009-08-14 23:11:00,128,"Is your float tube orange, and is this in pond mills?  I used to fish a big pond there just off Southdale and maybe I've seen you out there.  I haven't went out there this year.  After buying a boat the tube become a dust collector."
372875,jjcanoe,2009-08-15 13:52:00,744,"brown top, green bottom, and orange on the back. Probably me out there!  jjcanoe"
