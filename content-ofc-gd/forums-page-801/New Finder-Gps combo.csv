373077,Scott S,2009-08-16 13:45:00,203,I'm thinking of getting a new sonar unit with GPS.How much extra is it going to cost me to get the proper gps chip and what chip is the best. I have no idea what gps cards are out there. Please Help!!! Scooter

373106,ohhenrygsr,2009-08-16 15:10:00,947,Navionics are the only Lake Charts you'll ever need.  RadioWorld or Angler outfitters (jos) will help you out  http://www.navionics.com/HMPremium09LakeList.asp?RegionID=5
373109,smally21,2009-08-16 15:15:00,993,i use navionics hotmaps premium.  has good coverage but really depends on the year you purchase.  older ones are cheaper but have less definition.  i have a humminbird 580 and i think a better unit would show more of the cards potential.
