Page Views- 2.6 Million...one our top quarters so far Unique Visitors- 657,000 A NEW RECORD!!  Our membership increased by more than 10% in that time. We had over 32,000 posts which were viewed 1.4 million times...  We had a few minor server issues and a very serious hack attempt which cost us some time as well as DNS issues with Rogers (again). Overall it was a very good quarter and the membership is growing very fast. You guys and gals have been great and we only had a few minor issues to deal with. It is a great testament to you that a site like this can exist with such minor problems and on behalf of the admins, thanks very much.  There is going to be a few huge things coming... keep watching that little spot that says 'It is coming'...cause it is and we promise you will love it."
