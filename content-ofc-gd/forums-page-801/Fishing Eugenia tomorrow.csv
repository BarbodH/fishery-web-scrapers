372742,Toddyc20,2009-08-14 19:38:00,141,Hello all.  I'm heading out with my brother to Eugenia tomorrow and I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice for me?  Never been on this lake before but have heard a few things.  I'm not looking for any secret holes (although i wouldn't say no if you offered it   ) I'm just wondering about types of baits or even good colours that have been working.  Any tips would be greatly appreciated.  I hope i can come back on here tomorrow night and share some pics for a successful day out.

No need for speed on this lake.Just troll around and fish.  Look forward to your report.   Ok one spot for ya, North east of the lake. Laydown logs and high weeds. Try boiling some spinner baits above them.  Have fun."

372842,mizzmo,2009-08-15 02:52:00,30,I would definatley try black long power worm rigged texas style.  A grub (twister) tail on it.   Watch out for the rock bass in that lake.  Mizzmo
