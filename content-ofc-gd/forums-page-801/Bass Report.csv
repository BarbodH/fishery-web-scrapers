Nothin is better than a small feed of fish, I had my share of 1lb'rs cut up for a meal.    Congrads and thanks for sharing, MTBF"
372963,misfish,2009-08-15 23:26:00,29133,"My god man,you kept a bass. LOL  Like said,your choice do as you will. But also stated,keep the smaller ones (they are tastier) and let the bigger ones spawn and spawn.   Real nice fish. Congrats."
373089,Gerritt,2009-08-16 14:49:00,6129,"Nice report man, thanks for sharing.  GF"
373091,Burning Babies,2009-08-16 14:51:00,150," All fish have mercury; it is deposited from the atmosphere, and works it's way up the food chain, even in clean lakes.  The bigger the fish, the more mercury they bioaccumulate.  Just another reason to release the big ones and keep the smaller fish for table fare.  That said, the occasional big fish won't kill you.  Congrats on a nice catch."
373095,Syn,2009-08-16 14:55:00,519,"Nice catches, Kind of looks like chicken lol."
373097,splashhopper,2009-08-16 15:00:00,2931,"  Hey...... what gives... the young guy had the best night of fishing in his life,,, and you gotta be a %#+@&  ! about it!  what gives.  Everyone deserves an atta-boy... even you(maybe)   give the kid a break !"
373230,always_release,2009-08-16 22:37:00,5,"I know I am being an A** here, and I apologize for that if these are your occasional keep. But do you know how many members here want to slap your friend's face who was holding a dead nickel in the parking lot when they see that picture, I just happen to be the one who spit it out.  BTW, the bigger fish don't detoxicate themselves just because you say so."
372668,profisher25,2009-08-14 15:07:00,185,"Well, I have to say, this day was probably the best I had in 09'... so far. My friend asked me if I wanted to go fishing with him and his dad. Obviously I couldn't resist that offer. Soon after arrival, my friends dad, on his first cast caught the first 17"" fish of the night. Shortly after his minute of glory, I get a strike! After several minutes of constant reeling through think weeds, I reel in my PB 18"", 3 lbs Largemouth. Couple of hours go by and each of us lose a few fish, my friend gets the big strike! After 5 minutes of reeling in he pulls in his 5 lbs, 21 1/2"" fish! It was a great night and probably the best I've ever had!    "
372672,friarfish,2009-08-14 15:15:00,5,Nice fish - Congrats!  Did you eat 'em?
372673,fishindude,2009-08-14 15:15:00,220,Nice Largies! Were they released?
372676,TC1OZ,2009-08-14 15:18:00,987,Nice fish!
372677,profisher25,2009-08-14 15:20:00,185,We released all of them except of those in the second picture.
372682,Harrison,2009-08-14 15:48:00,2202,"Nice fish, gald you had fun.  Is that the 5lber in the 2nd photo?"
372687,profisher25,2009-08-14 16:01:00,185,"Yes it is, its the one in my friends left hand."
372690,jediangler,2009-08-14 16:10:00,1923,Bon appetite   .
372694,msp,2009-08-14 16:18:00,1336,"Great fish that you guys caught. It is important to our/your fishery that those larger fish are released to breed another day. You are within your right to keep them if you want to, but you should keep the smaller ones for the table. Maybe next time"
372695,bassjnkie,2009-08-14 16:19:00,1101,What size were the ones you released? Sounds like a great time.
372702,Leecher,2009-08-14 16:35:00,7832,Congrats on your PB What were you catching them on?? Leechman
372723,always_release,2009-08-14 18:38:00,5," Yes, he released... the smaller catch. The bigger fish has more meat, more mercury and other contamination to feed the whole family. Good choice"
372738,Victor,2009-08-14 19:30:00,1609,Nice fish.  Can you share what kind of structures they were caught at and what was the weapon of choice? If it's a secret it's alright.
372747,dagoat_1,2009-08-14 20:03:00,72,Way to go bud! I'll be out to bring home a few this weekend as well.
372762,bushart,2009-08-14 21:52:00,2628,Looks Great Profisher---really puttin on a clinic  Don't let the unofficial OFC conscience patrol rattle ya bud---I eat some bigger fish also from time to time  Pretty sure thats why mankind tried fishing to begin with  They're probably bugged cause they can't catch em that big---that's what I used to say if I shot a 4 point buck that I was lettin the big ones go to breed----see I can be a conservationist  You get an official attaboy---looked like fun  Bushart
372764,Radnine,2009-08-14 21:56:00,1538,"Hey welcome to the board and congrats, your first post is a corker. Jim"
372848,yo_guy,2009-08-15 04:40:00,111,Next time do a fake release photo of how your buddy realeased the fish if you intend to post pics...  Nice Largemouth that's for sure!!!
372858,alphaalpha,2009-08-15 08:57:00,475,"  look at his name, probably some spineless lurker that doesn't have the 'nads to post on his main account.  hopefully the mods can pick it up and get him for multiple accounts if this is the case.   Very nice fish btw, Congrats on your PB!!!"
372862,Roy,2009-08-15 12:05:00,13728, And I thought that people from Ottawa were more polite.
372879,profisher25,2009-08-15 14:48:00,185,"Look, overall the three of us caught our quota.My friend however decided to keep his two large ones, after I encouraged him to release the big ones he caught. I did however keep my 18"" and a 15"". To be perfectly honest with everyone, these are the first largemouth I have caught this year, and the first I have ever kept to eat in 10 years! I totally respect our conservation laws and do what ever I can to protect and preserve this native species! I wasn't originally going to keep the fish I caught, but I figured 'what the heck', I never keep any fish anyway, so no harm done by keeping conservation limit this time. Although, I strongly put into action the release of much larger fish! I hope that my children will one day fish the same species that I have caught in my youth years, and therefore always release every large fish I catch, and will always do so in the future!"
372880,Roy,2009-08-15 14:51:00,13728,"Thank you but I didn't think you needed to explain that, Bud."
372881,jediangler,2009-08-15 14:52:00,1923,How did they taste? Any worms in the meat?
372884,profisher25,2009-08-15 15:02:00,185,"  Secret?!?!?! A good angler never keeps secrets!  Umm, I was fishing shallow weedy water with some weedless topwaters. Stop n' go retrieve always works! A good trick that will drive bass crazy is to retrieve any topwater your using and allow your bait to stop and rest on any lilly pads in the area. It teases the bass, and as soon as that bait comes off that lilly pad, get ready to hold on to your rod!!!"
372885,profisher25,2009-08-15 15:03:00,185," Haven't eaten them yet, but no worms, and no mercury."
372886,profisher25,2009-08-15 15:05:00,185," Im sorry for the paragraph, though I do admit I go overboard with the explanations... just want people to understand Im not some crazy lunatic who doesn't respect our laws!"
