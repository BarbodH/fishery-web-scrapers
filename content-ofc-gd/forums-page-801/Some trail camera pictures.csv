373314,Mattones,2009-08-17 01:56:00,587,Busy few days after putting out the salt rock on Monday! There are mnay more pictures but alot are just them in the same spot so i didnt bother adding them. Also there where about 15 photo's of a raccoon family eating up ALL the apples I put out for the deer. haha I deleted the pictures as they came at night i'm not a fan of coons.  I knew there was a fawn around this part of the farm as I could tell by the foot prints I have been seeing in the mud. Still no sign of the two bucks which where first caught on the trail camera two months ago.  I figure they moved to the back of the farm where there is alot of deer activity. But some how they always avoided the camera. lol  You will notice the single doe just hanging out by the pond and salt lick for a good 20+ minutes. I am really hoping they stick around as I got a doe tag! of course I will leave momma and baby be but this area is FULL of does and I just wish I applied for a 2nd doe tag.   Baby fawn          Checking to see if this is a salt rock aswell. haha
