372761,rbaquial,2009-08-14 21:51:00,968,"Hey Guys,  Was checking out YouTube and came across  I found it interesting myself, thought I would share it with other anglers off the board. Its CAMOFLAGE for FISHERMAN...hehe...gives us MORE REASON to spend our hard earned bux!  Anyone seen this in stores yet? If so, where?  Enjoy! Rob"

372774,misfish,2009-08-14 22:21:00,29133," DROOL.  As for the fishoflage,nice shirt.I buy one."
372779,Syn,2009-08-14 22:29:00,519,"I always wear my fish ""camo"" suit while fishing.   This is the ultimate fish magnet shirt though. Caught a 60 ft humpback whale (8lb mono) on balsam wearing this shirt:   Would not fit in the cradle but was a quick unhook."
372786,crankbait,2009-08-14 22:49:00,82, I wear mine too it's awesome I have all these girls come flocking to me while I fish and it cured my baldness.
372789,misfish,2009-08-14 22:57:00,29133," Man ,I would rather have the ladies then girls.LOL"
372812,JohnF,2009-08-15 00:15:00,3494, Right! Like we need an excuse to buy more crap. I already have enuf fishing gear for several guys to go bass hunting in style. I seriously doubt we need camo to sneak up on bass. They're about as subtle as a bean fart in a small room. I'll put my bux into more toys.  JF
372822,kickingfrog,2009-08-15 00:50:00,8333,No thanks.
372823,dada2727,2009-08-15 00:50:00,108,"When I'm musky fishing I try not to wear bright colours so I have less of a chance spooking a follow, but that's about as far as it goes."
372828,dave524,2009-08-15 01:10:00,4508,"Low water steelheading, camoflage top really helps, too many times I've seen bright yellow raingear send fish scattering as a guy walk thru on the bank., but I think I'll stick to my deer hunting duds."
372831,Daplumma,2009-08-15 01:29:00,1961,I have heard of wearing light colored and blue on sunny days but not sure it makes a big differance. Joe
372832,BUSTER,2009-08-15 01:31:00,1336,I'd buy that
372839,TC1OZ,2009-08-15 02:27:00,987,What about the GIANT f'in boat you are fishing from? Don't worry the fish are distracted by the bass in the weeds on your t-shirt....
372845,NAW,2009-08-15 03:13:00,4022,I can NOT stand Al Lindner!  That guy really rubs me the wrong way.  How much did you get paid to pump that add Al.  Kickingfrog probly said it better then I did.
372867,Roy,2009-08-15 12:45:00,13728,"If you want to know where to buy the stuff, PM Karl Kalonka."
372873,johnnyb,2009-08-15 13:32:00,3413,"Huh...not sure what to make of it.  He's not saying it'll help you catch more fish...kind of an interesting spin on clothing for fishermen...but the angle about an ""identity for fishermen"" or a ""uniform"" was being pitched a little too heavily.  But that's Lindner...he takes stuff seriously...whaddyagonnado? Basically it's another ""lucky shirt"""
372896,danada,2009-08-15 16:04:00,31,looks like p.js to me
372915,laszlo,2009-08-15 19:02:00,487,life style identification???  give me a break. advertising just drives me crazy.
372927,Burning Babies,2009-08-15 20:03:00,150,"I'll pass.  Linder was one of the most influential figures in my formative education as an angler, but these days, it does seem to be all about the Benjamins."
372930,Dara,2009-08-15 20:20:00,3052,O.....M....G...shakes head..hangs it a little..and walks away
