412493,johnnyb,2009-12-16 16:13:00,3413,"Not what we wanted to hear, Nemo...but thanks for checking.  Apparently Minden got the most snow in that bout of lake effect stuff that pummelled Muskoka last week...128 cms is what I heard.  Sucky, sucky, sucky."
412611,Sinker,2009-12-16 22:40:00,8692,"Don't believe everything they tell you. Your better to go for a drive and see for yourself. I've been told by them before that there was no safe ice, only to go up with no fishing gear, and find plenty of ice over 6"" thick. I'm sure the big lakes are ice free, but some of the small back lakes are probably doable now.  S."
412779,singingdog,2009-12-17 11:15:00,1047,"The snow was very localised. Minden got about 12o cms, but Haliburton Forest got very little out of the same storm. The north end of Haliburton Lake only got about 10 cms. It's -22 here this morning, and most lakes right around Haliburton have very little snow on top of the ice. I would imagine there will be lots of small lakes with enough ice by this weekend."
413812,Paully,2009-12-20 13:15:00,712,Has anyone ventured out on the ice yet?
413818,singingdog,2009-12-20 13:39:00,1047,"Some folks have been out on a small lake just down the road from me. I don't know the thickness, but I will check it today."
413819,Terry,2009-12-20 13:44:00,14456,sounds like I just might get out before the new year
413882,Paully,2009-12-20 15:42:00,712,  When you say small lake do you mean large pond?  The lake i fish is not very big but its fairly long. The deepest part is 60-80 feet but most of the lake is about 30 -40 ft. Jan. 1st is just around the corner
415470,fishboy,2009-12-26 17:30:00,550,any updates to the Minden/Haliburton ice status?  Cheers!
415941,Paully,2009-12-28 11:21:00,712,bumpity bump.. Should i bring a boat or an ice hut?
416032,fishboy,2009-12-28 17:21:00,550, you and me are both in the wonder....
416138,GBW,2009-12-28 22:20:00,8460,"the lake we are on (close to Balsam) was making ice big time last night (crazy sounds and cracks).  it was 6"" thick on boxing day and prob another 1 or 1.5"" thicker now but I didn't test it today.  i was on it but didn't drill and check..."
406691,Paully,2009-11-29 21:32:00,712,Trout season opens January 1st on the lake i fished last year with some success.. so im wondering if ayone can give me an idea if there is any ice forming on the lakes?  Is the ice good every year by jan. 1st?
406695,irishfield,2009-11-29 21:36:00,26272,There's no ice on Temagami yet.. not even anything up at Simon's in Dryden.  Might be this week though... -8 each night.  Georgian Bay water temp is currently 46.3 F as of yesterday afternoon.  Weird year for sure.. we drove the truck out to the camp on Dec 22nd last year.. wont' be happening this year TFSure !
406749,bigugli,2009-11-29 23:12:00,6138,"Timing freeze up in the Haliburtons is like shooting craps. We've had good ice by Christmas one year, and no snow or ice til February the next."
406929,singingdog,2009-11-30 10:59:00,1047,"No ice at all yet. Most years, Jan 1 would be a bit dicey for getting on most of the lakes in this area."
406960,Nemo,2009-11-30 14:04:00,727,See for yourself..  http://www.halcom.ca/haliburton_static.php  No ice or snow by the looks of it.
406965,jimmer,2009-11-30 14:33:00,2730,"Best to hope for no snow before the lakes freeze to a good thickness.  I have been hesitant to go out on opening for the last couple of years due to the amount of snow.  You get 3-4"" of ice then a foot of snow, which makes for a lot of slush and weight on top of the ice.  I was out in the boat a week ago fishing for lakers."
407111,Paully,2009-11-30 21:21:00,712,Last year i was up in wilberforce for new years and the lake had 4-6 inches of good solid ice with no snow on top.. hopefully things freeze up sooner than later!
407643,singingdog,2009-12-02 11:56:00,1047,We are going to need some good cold nights before any ice forms. Water temps are still above 40C.
407774,jimmer,2009-12-02 18:15:00,2730,That means I might still get out in the boat this weekend
408061,Paully,2009-12-03 11:55:00,712,If the lake has open water by january 1st... is it ok to fish for them out of a boat of does it have to be through the ice??
408101,irishfield,2009-12-03 15:00:00,26272,Season is a season... but only use one rod from the boat !.. not two !
408252,Paully,2009-12-03 23:11:00,712,The lake i fish only has a one rod limit...and a slot size.
408260,GBW,2009-12-03 23:55:00,8460,"but during the ""ice"" season you can use 2 rod's..."
408267,irishfield,2009-12-04 00:10:00,26272, Not necessarily.. check the exceptions. MANY lakes with a one rod limit in 15.
408328,GBW,2009-12-04 03:04:00,8460,"Sorry Wayne, was still thinking zone 16 and Scugog so you are correct. The new book is out on Jan 1 2010 according to the zone 17 update pdf shorelunch..."
408985,Paully,2009-12-06 14:19:00,712,"anyone got an update for me... i've been following the weather network, looks cold enough for ice making. http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/caon0287"
408988,BeRad3000,2009-12-06 14:30:00,65,We would have to launch your boat by the culvert. You wouldn't want to drive in even if we could. Getting trapped there would suck.  
409217,Paully,2009-12-07 00:41:00,712, Talk about a stupid move!...  but im sure it wont be the last..
409319,singingdog,2009-12-07 11:22:00,1047,"Well, as is so often the case, I was wrong.    3 nights ago ice started forming on smaller lakes and sheltered bays. The forecast looks good, with more cold nights on the way. A small lake just down the road from my place went from entirely open one night to completely skimmed over with ice by then next morning."
409446,icceman,2009-12-07 20:41:00,36,"In Haliburton forest by kennisis lake the smallerlakes and ponds have a skim coat over them if the weather holds up it will be a few weeks.  -10c at nights -1 during the day .  That be ice makin weather,"
409451,johnnyb,2009-12-07 21:07:00,3413,"welcome aboard, icceman....I see you were waiting for first ice to make your first post    Keep the updates coming, my good man!!!!"
411543,Paully,2009-12-13 15:46:00,712,With all the snow up there this week do you think it will hamper the ice making process?
411587,irishfield,2009-12-13 17:58:00,26272,"It will stop it dead in it's, or should I say your, tracks.... unless it pushed the ice down and the water has flooded the snow."
411594,lookinforwalleye,2009-12-13 18:30:00,4399,What`s with all this ice talk?? I can`t wait for Spring!!LOL
412481,Nemo,2009-12-16 15:49:00,727,Just called Minden Bait and Tackle (705) 286-4826.  The news was not good. They stated there was no ice yet that was safe. They also said the snow they got last week has put a damper on ice production as predicted.  The estimate was a few weeks.....  Hmmm
