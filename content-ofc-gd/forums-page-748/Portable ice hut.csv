416393,Paully,2009-12-29 14:59:00,712,I plan on doing a bit more ice fishing this year than other years and dont want to freeze my   off outside ..  Does anyone own this style of hut ? are you happy with it?  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...__SearchResults
416396,motion,2009-12-29 15:09:00,403,"Hey Shore, I own the larger version of this hut and I love it. Ours is the 4-6 man size (3 guys comfortably). I think they are good (value) huts. They are easy to transport as they are light weight and have the added convenience of a floor to keep your toes warm.  Good investment in my opinion."
416399,Paully,2009-12-29 15:12:00,712,Where did you purchase yours?.. i dident even know there was a larger version! Im looking to buy one asap..
416402,Paully,2009-12-29 15:19:00,712,"I just got off the phoe with Bps and they dont even carry this product, even thou its clearly shown on the web site...  The person on the phone was of little use! couldent even tell me what they did carry.."
416404,motion,2009-12-29 15:21:00,403,Got it from a board member last year (used). I don't see them listed on the Shappell website this year. The 2-3 man size will be good (tight) for two anglers and your gear. My hut will let 4 guys (tight) fish with all our gear. I tow mine behind my ATV as it has pop-up skis.  You may want to search for a used one.
416405,ckrb2007,2009-12-29 15:22:00,449,"Personally, I'd look into getting a Flip-over style hut simply due to the easy of set-up and take-down....especially in the windy conditions. Plus, you can store most of your gear inside the attached sled. Yes, they may be more pricey...but well worth it IMHO.  My 2cents. Colin"
416407,richyb,2009-12-29 15:24:00,774,"  Thats typical BPS for you , I hate the place. There might be 5 people in the whole place that even have any clue about hunting / fishing. Any time I go there I walk in the door with a big smile and walk out wanting to punch something. Never have what ever im looking for that has been advertised."

They have not very good reps in the store, i called about a Lowrance ice machine, ""oh we don t carry them anymore"" my buddy was there the next day and saw them set up, I won t even was a phone call to them anymore, thats twice for me now."
