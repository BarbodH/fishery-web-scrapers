416344,solopaddler,2009-12-29 12:17:00,8605," Have you heard the expression ""the inmates are running the asylum?"""
416346,Roy,2009-12-29 12:34:00,13728," Thanks, Mike. Nice to wake up to."
416366,JohnF,2009-12-29 13:56:00,3494,When I was a kid I was always being told not to play with the bad kids. That sucked. They had all the fun.  JF
416368,Beans,2009-12-29 14:02:00,3339, I think it was just the bad girls they were warning you to stay away from John...
416384,JohnF,2009-12-29 14:46:00,3494,"Them too, but we haven't any bad girls here on OFC  - or do we?  JF"
416520,Dara,2009-12-29 22:24:00,3052,I think he backed his truck into the water at the launch and now he's embarassed to show up here

416523,glen,2009-12-29 22:29:00,2641,ahhhh.  that feels better.  welcome back.
416524,pike slayer,2009-12-29 22:35:00,1177,ohhh darn! all good things must come to an end!
416528,mbac31,2009-12-29 22:40:00,904,"What are you talking about. Did you not notice that OFC made a new law stating, No shirt No service kinda policy. Dawg had to go shopping. "
416529,JohnF,2009-12-29 22:46:00,3494,Now that he's listening do we have to stop talking about him?  JF
416532,Greencoachdog,2009-12-29 22:50:00,8163," no no, y'all just carry on like I'm not here."

416537,cram,2009-12-29 23:04:00,1733,Hey Glen -- do you guys have cranberry sauce and gravy with your Possum for christmas dinner?
416541,Greencoachdog,2009-12-29 23:07:00,8163, Heck no!!!  Sweet taters and collard greens are the only sides for a possum dinner!!!  ... pecan pie for desert!
416543,Sinker,2009-12-29 23:09:00,8692,Merry Christmas Glen!! Have a happy new year too EH!!  S.
416549,JohnF,2009-12-29 23:29:00,3494, Alabamaniacs don't do rum. They've figgered out how to distill the essence outa possum roadkill. They call it squeezin's fer a reason - possum squeezin's. The hot pavement is perfect for accelerating the fermentation process. Ya just have to get it up off the road before all the good juice gets squeezed out on the pavement by the buggy wheels.  JF
416590,misfish,2009-12-30 00:44:00,29133,"My days of morn have ended,,,,,,,,,,finally.   Ya ol redneck."

415318,darsky,2009-12-25 18:43:00,586,after seeing 150 posts a day from him you kind of notice when its down to zero. All good ??
415324,Paully,2009-12-25 19:18:00,712,finally we can all post without being in fear of getting harassed ....   lol
415598,redneck666,2009-12-27 01:15:00,563,maybe he finally realized not a whole lot of people like him?....... i bet Dr.S is enjoying GCD's time away from the forum... lol
415600,Hellfish,2009-12-27 01:20:00,308,Come on now really? That was a little childish there redneck I think maybe you should realize you just might be in the same boat. Disagreeing with someone and hating them are 2 completely different things. Sorry but your a tool.
415601,misfish,2009-12-27 01:23:00,29133,DAWG RULES.  enough said.
415602,redneck666,2009-12-27 01:33:00,563," okay so, me being in the same boat..... are you calling him a tool too?  btw never said anything about ""hating"" what you shoulda got outta that sentence was the word DISLIKE....  So, if anything your the tool here.....  anyhow im not goin to sit here and argue over something so stupid, heres an old saying i hope you comprehend: to each their own."
415603,smally21,2009-12-27 01:49:00,993,have you simply noticed he is not around or are you actually 'missing him'????
415611,danbouck,2009-12-27 02:27:00,4380,
415659,Twocoda,2009-12-27 05:43:00,4130,IM A TOOL!!! useful one too.... wow i feel better i got that off my chest...now i can begin to heal
415676,canadadude,2009-12-27 12:46:00,769,"I miss him, he may be right off the wall at times but he's always is great entertainment hahahahaha. I kinda enjoy the bashing threads, they always put a smile on my face"
415693,ricoboxing,2009-12-27 14:35:00,398,maybe he's too hungover to post?
415697,lookinforwalleye,2009-12-27 14:41:00,4399,GCD??? never heard of him!!
415716,Beans,2009-12-27 16:28:00,3339, AMEN !!! me brudder !!!
415720,Hellfish,2009-12-27 17:10:00,308," I believe you wrote that, enough said. Hows the boat hunting going?   Take care bubba"
415757,JohnF,2009-12-27 19:38:00,3494,"Some folks are too sensitive for Dawg's sense of humour. Sometimes thick hide is handy on the net. The anonymity coupled with the familiarity ( I know, I know, it sounds like a contradiction, but think about it) leads to more blunt expression than we usually expect at a casual get together in real life, especially us oh so polite Canucks.  Those of you who find Dawg too caustic really need to toughen up, or ignore him. I don't know him other than from on here and a few private messages, but he seems like a good guy to me. It isn't always the folks who tell me only what I want to hear that are necessarily the only kind I want to be around. We all need a little honesty and/or caustic humour in our diet.  JF"
416126,Beans,2009-12-28 21:45:00,3339,Alright Dawg...time to speak up...you got too many friends and people who like you on here to let a few bother you...(I know where you're hiding...LOL)
416195,misfish,2009-12-29 00:44:00,29133,"  John,I think it,s the ones that dont think of him as being, ""politically correct"".    TOOOOOOO BAD for them."
416198,Leecher,2009-12-29 00:55:00,7832, Thoughtfulness and respect is what comes to mind when the name GCD aka Glen is mentioned to me.... wish he could chime in.... really miss him.  Leechman
416227,Twocoda,2009-12-29 01:40:00,4130,should turn this thread into a a roast for GCD  other then the awesome jigs he makes (pssssst feel free to send me some  if you havent drank them all   ) the best thing about GCD or GDC whatever his name is.....   ...is the fact that he has a Canadian wife  ...that alone makes him half smert and if one of our fellow country people would actually marry him theres alot to be said for that ...after all... its kept him off the Jerry Springer Show  making more air time for the rest of the Alabama residents from Hod Swaller  The reason he hasnt been posting as of late is probably because his hands are preoccupied trying to remove his foot from his mouth I say stop trying to pull your foot out and simply  use a hack saw to cut it off at the ankle  and start speading the sunshine you bestow upon us  Cheers and Happy Holidays Glen to you and yours
416232,skeeter,2009-12-29 01:49:00,1907,we have had the pleasure of meeting gcd in person and we love him. he is one heck of a funny  and loving guy. keep up the good work coach dog   your friends Dann & Miss Kelly
416277,HTHM,2009-12-29 03:40:00,4082,"As I indicated before, he is on a secret mission and cannot be disturbed right now. I have first hand knowledge of this, and am sworn to secrecy. All will be revealed in due time....."
416289,ehg,2009-12-29 04:08:00,2666,"GCD seems to have a keen interest in Ontario fishing, hope he starts posting again.  Whatever happened to Holdfast as well?"
416290,splashhopper,2009-12-29 04:12:00,2931,"  just tried sending a PM to Holdfast.... got this immediately>>  ""This message can not be sent because the recipient has their personal messenger disabled or they are in a member group not allowed to use the personal messenger.  This personal message has not been sent""  not sure what that means... I miss his reports and that crazy little dog of his."
416325,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-29 06:41:00,0,  he's harmless.  he just knows how to get peoples goat that's all. i like his posting much more than holdie's propaganda.
416333,Rich Clemens,2009-12-29 11:26:00,3131,  Oh No      They've sent him to 'Mod' School.   We'll have a new moderator when he returns.   Come back soon Glen ... we miss you.
