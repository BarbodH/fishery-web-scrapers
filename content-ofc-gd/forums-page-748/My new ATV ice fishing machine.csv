415511,motion,2009-12-26 19:39:00,403,"So I have finally finished my ATV rig for ice fishing. My son and I really got into it late last year so I decided to get the ATV ready for this year. I added a two up seat (I know it may not legal, but I will take my chances on the lake)I made up a new basket for the front that hold two Rubbermaid roughnecks and my  Mr. heater. I added a thumb warmer and hot grips as well.  The ice auger was a challenge but I made a metal bracket to hold it on the back of the ATV secularly. The minnow bucket fits on the back of the two up seat where the gas can usually goes, perfectly. There is tons of storage to hold my essential items such as shovel, tackle and tip ups. I canâ€™t wait for the ice to be safe (soon I hope!!!!) to take this machine out for some lakers, whities and perch.  Thought I would share it with all of you. Hope to see everyone on Lake Simcoe soon!!  Cheers.  ["
415530,Terry,2009-12-26 20:09:00,14456,looks great  I miss my Yamaha ATV...   maybe I will see you on simcoe
415535,motion,2009-12-26 20:31:00,403,"Thanks Terry. Its my first ATV, but I love my Yamaha too!"
415538,Terry,2009-12-26 20:43:00,14456,well lock her up tight  mine was stolen  you might want to buy a set of chains for the back wheels  I didn't put them on often but always had them with me  I got stuck in a slush field and couldn't move put the chains on and drove out a good investment
415551,motion,2009-12-26 21:53:00,403,Terry was yours a four wheel drive ATV? I was at Royal Distributing and was looking at the chains. I dont know how my machine will be in deeper snow on the lake. I may pick up a pair (or two).
415557,Terry,2009-12-26 22:28:00,14456,"yeah I had a 2006 griz 660 4x4  I found you are best to run most of the time without chains they tend to always dig in, whereas without hem you can run on top of crusty snow but with them on you push through the snow because they do dig in  but in slushy conditions I would not go without them on same if there is no snow for steering control they sure help  "
415559,irishfield,2009-12-26 22:30:00,26272,Hard to tell in the picture... is your auger exactly centre on the back? Becomes VERY important if you're going into any back lakes on portage paths..
415563,motion,2009-12-26 22:40:00,403,"Wayne, it does stick out slightly on either side protected by the metal mounting bracket. I only fish Lake Simcoe but can see your point about running through the bush. I would have to re-think the bracket if I change my fishing routine."
415579,Fisherman,2009-12-27 00:04:00,7201,"Like Wayne said with the extra width, careful with the extra weight up top, tends to make them lean a bit."
415582,irishfield,2009-12-27 00:22:00,26272,Even with them centre'd...can still get bent! Auger is exact width of the ski stance.. and auger is centre'd.. still hooked a tree !  
415663,ch312,2009-12-27 06:05:00,1590,might want to consider getting a fairing if you will be running in open areas. i threw one on my grizzly 700 and its awesome. makes a huge difference when riding when its a tad chilly out.  it looks like chains will work on those tires. chains wont work on many of the more aggressive tires with big lugs because the chains just fall between the lugs rendering them useless. studs are the way to go with the tires that have big lugs. im waiting on the snow to test out my radial mud lites...  btw...radials OWN 6ply tires in traction and handling
415665,motion,2009-12-27 06:17:00,403,I was thinking of a fairing as well. Might look to add that next year. I'll see how it goes this year (if it ever comes. LOL)
415728,ch312,2009-12-27 17:38:00,1590," i am 24 and was called a wimp and some other not so nice words by the 8+ other guys i regularly ride with for getting heated grips and a fairing. apparently ""real men"" dont need that kinda stuff. the funny thing is 3 of those guys now have fairings and heated grips as well after trying mine out.  after all the whining the other guys did last time i dont think it will be long before they get fairings and heated grips too   our group is addicted to quading and spend way too much money on them. we often run in a group of 15+ so i get to see a lot of new tires, winches, accessories, etc in action nearly every weekend. if you have any questions about anything dont hesitate to give me a shout"
415774,EE_,2009-12-27 21:05:00,36,"  Dont run any toys, but always think the vertical mount is a better layout in any sense...I know I know the up hill thing, but thats rare  Nice rig motion"
415781,tibbs,2009-12-27 22:13:00,650,Looks like your going to have a blast ice fishing this year.
415800,hockeyplayerz_14,2009-12-27 23:24:00,160,"This is my ATV Motion is my dad and i must say he put alot of money and hard work into this. I just want to thank you for every thing you have done for me because the word ""fishermen"" is in my blood"
415813,motion,2009-12-28 00:00:00,403,"Thanks EE and tibbs, I cant wait to get out there and try it out. As for fishman2202 (my son), we're going to enjoy fishing for whities and lakers more this year. We will give those perch a break!! LOL."
416023,Sudsmaster,2009-12-28 17:00:00,29,May I make a suggestion?  With the auger on the back of the bike the tires have a tendency to throw snow up onto the head of the auger sometimes causing the recoil to freeze ( running through loose powder or slush) ...only happened once to me and we were not able to start it as the recoil and throttle controls were completely frozen with slush....Since then I just cover my auger head with a bag (reuseable shopping bag)and a elastic velcro strap and it keeps the head debris free ....works like a charm...that's a nice setup ...enjoy  Suds

416103,Dara,2009-12-28 20:56:00,3052,"  Hauling it like that, I would be taking the power head off.  I used to till I got my otter. For that I put a bunch of eye bolts through to the inside at the bottom so i can strap stuff down for a rough ride"
416112,irishfield,2009-12-28 21:13:00,26272,That's the only trail I've ever had an issue on Dara! I have the motor/auger quick pinned... so future rides thru portages will find the power head in the hut sled.
416369,motion,2009-12-29 14:02:00,403, Thanks for that tip Suds. I will get a cover for the auger head for sure. Cant wait for the Lake to freeze up good so we can give it a good test!!
416420,irishfield,2009-12-29 15:46:00,26272,I found a small double zipper top gym bag worked perfect for mine Motion and also gave me a pocket to put the auger extension in! 
416455,motion,2009-12-29 18:15:00,403,"Awesome!!   Thanks Wayne, I'll look for something like that myself.  Cheers."
416463,irishfield,2009-12-29 18:29:00,26272,"A sled helmut bag, with the draw string, will work in some cases as well Tony !"
