I finally got my first walleye through the ice....must still be some of that good luck from Lloyd rubbin' off on me! This little feller came from Nosbonsing last Sunday...followed immediately afterward by a snot rocket, then silence for the rest of the day.  Cousin Bicephalic managed to light up a few perch here and there....felt great to be on the ice!   Yes, the grin is bigger than the fish!   Still grinning about the walleye...this pike was hovering under the hole probably trying to eat it     Did I mention it was my first walleye through the ice?!?!    heeheeheeeeee  Merry Christmas to meeee   Tight lines, everybody!"
415464,Terry,2009-12-26 17:01:00,14456,"I was going to make it look bigger with photoshop  but it was too small to lock onto ...LOL  hey you got one,  that's all that counts nice going"
415529,Joeytier,2009-12-26 20:06:00,3990,Can't wait to hit Nosbonsing!  Nice going.
415531,vinnimon,2009-12-26 20:09:00,2593,My pike was about the same size in the open river and lost a huge pickerel.

415638,Curtis,2009-12-27 03:35:00,83,"lol nice going i have yet to catch one through the ice, i have enough trouble catching walleye in open water..  Probably has more to do with the fact that i target them maybe three times a year.. lol"

415966,corvette1,2009-12-28 13:39:00,1765,way to go johnny who says size matters congrats
415979,solopaddler,2009-12-28 14:15:00,8605,Right on Johnny! Glad to see you started your ice fishing season on a high.
415996,johnnyb,2009-12-28 15:32:00,3413," LOL...thanks Terry...I'll try harder next time   Word on the street is that it's pretty solid right now...seems to get lost in the shadow of Nipissing   PHhhhheeeeewwwww!!!!!!  I just about started to cry!!!    Yes...so far I'm lucky that she's supportive of me going out on these trips while she takes care of Baby Laker...but I'm torn between missing her company on the ice, and finally getting a shot at catching something myself!    Not me....    YESSSS!!!! No rockbass so far...it's a good thing!!!"
416119,Laker272,2009-12-28 21:30:00,45,"WTG Johnny. I know it hasn't benn from lack of trying. The curse is broken, be ready for limiting from here on in."
416560,Greencoachdog,2009-12-29 23:56:00,8163,"Sorry Johnny, but that's not a Wall-ice... that there would be one of them Pickeral type fishes, he'll have to grow for another 5 or 6 years to become a Wall-ice!  If you want to catch enough big fish to eat for dinner, you need to take the LLJ fishing with you!"
416594,johnnyb,2009-12-30 00:54:00,3413,LOL -- thanks for the clarification Dawg
416609,Rizzo,2009-12-30 01:04:00,4754,look at the dorsal fin on that thing...you could fly it like a kite (probably light enough too  )
