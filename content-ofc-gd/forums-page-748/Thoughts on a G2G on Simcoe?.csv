415931,HTHM,2009-12-28 06:05:00,4082,I'm in for any Saturday that is chosen.
416142,Jds63,2009-12-28 22:35:00,1365,I would like to meet up with you all as well .... either date is good I'll be walking it as well ... would love to try for some whities or lakers  thanks
416145,Harrison,2009-12-28 22:38:00,2202,"I am good for any other weekend then the 14th weekend, I am at the show, plus it is ""love"" day and my daughter's bday which in turn = $$$$ day!"
416161,Spiel,2009-12-28 23:18:00,9065,"For me the later the date the better the odds I'll be well enough (hopefully) to attend.  That being said the 20th is the logical choice, for me."
416164,Roy,2009-12-28 23:33:00,13728,I can only get out your way once for the next while and it'll be the weekend of the 13th for the Spring Fishing Show. I'd like to do both but I can't.
416166,danbouck,2009-12-28 23:36:00,4380,I'll be there whatever day it is.
416185,Chuck Best,2009-12-29 00:18:00,308,"And we live here,so, just let me know when your all coming....."
416188,Fisherman,2009-12-29 00:24:00,7201," Well how nice of you Chuck, but ya have to post your phone # if we're coming to stay   I'm sure Shelley will be just thrilled,  or does she know about this part yet..."
416200,misfish,2009-12-29 00:58:00,29133,  Party in the CHUCKSTERS HOUSE. LOL
416719,Chuck Best,2009-12-30 09:47:00,308,"Well, if the date is going to be the 20th of Feb,com'on over, 'cause Shelley's B-day is the 21st......we'll have to start 1 day early.....lol....and of course,it'll be a surprise.....lol....TC and see ya here.....Chuck....."
416720,ChrisK,2009-12-30 10:01:00,2772," Don't worry Spiel,I'll have you in a body cast and roll you out there in a wheel chair if I have too   I just got to get over this nagging ACL in my right knee. Got smoked by a Mastif couple weeks ago at the dog park  Nothing a good dose of Tylonol won't fix though..."
416773,NAW,2009-12-30 15:14:00,4022,I'm on Simcoe every weekend for hard water.  So any weekend works for me!
414644,tschirk,2009-12-23 00:19:00,261,"I have the itch to ice some Whities & Lakers? When would a good & safe date be, do you think? Who would like to go? Cheers Ted"
414646,Terry,2009-12-23 00:22:00,14456,around Feb.
414671,Fish Farmer,2009-12-23 01:07:00,2234,"I'm in for it, some time in Feb, except the 6th. I'm doing a bus trip on Simcoe."
414703,raptorfan,2009-12-23 02:22:00,126,"I don't really know anyone on here, and have never fished hard water but I would be interested in going and learning a few things if I was welcome."
415059,Fisherman,2009-12-24 14:22:00,7201,"Ya usually anywhere after the 3rd week of Jan, the lake is pretty much frozen all over ""safely"", I guess the majority would have to pick a spot for the fishing and all important parking area. Raptorfan..for you our fine OFC friend, you still have to pay welcoming fees ...your job will be to drill all the holes with a dull drill instead.     A venue like that, you get to meet a lot of good people, no point in being a stranger.   Hopefully it works out."
415065,ChrisK,2009-12-24 14:42:00,2772,"Hmmm,this could  be an interesting idea.....Lets pin it and see where it goes"
415103,Terry,2009-12-24 16:49:00,14456,"it would be great to get lots of members new and  old together on simcoe there has been one for many years  misfish started the OFC  lake simcoe M&G, then he let it become the Tyler event  so whether it's a simple group fishing together or a full blown M&G..it should happen"
415223,Beans,2009-12-25 00:09:00,3339,"Oh Yeah...I remember meeting for the ""Pike Fling"" just outside of ""Hooter's"""
415235,misfish,2009-12-25 00:34:00,29133,"  I do believe Chris(Spiel)held the first (out from Innisfil park).Something about not wearing helmets comes to mind.  Oh, and team misfish showing up at the end of the day with 2 lakers and a pike(out of 60 ft of water out from Fox)Skuds surprised us all with that one.It was an amazing sight to see.     If I may,,,,,, If there is a G2G,lets do a fifty,fifty.Half to the biggest fish,no mater the spieces,and the rest to Tyler.  Thats the least we can do,after all the hard work that has come of it.    We can do it there again Norm.I remeber how yer eyes glowed.LOL"
415246,Terry,2009-12-25 01:21:00,14456, yeah that's what I remember too
415302,T Fisher,2009-12-25 06:31:00,139,"Count me in, The end of Febuary  sounds good it would make traveling on the ice great not to mention parking."
415356,tschirk,2009-12-25 23:23:00,261,It would be nice to fish the trout grounds. How about 2nd or 3rd week in Feb? Where is the best place to park .. Sibald? I would likely snowmobile out....
415361,Fisherman,2009-12-26 00:34:00,7201,Wow this sure took off like a cat with a turpentined ringpiece.  I'll have to adjust the work schedule by the looks of things.  Saturday or Sunday and which weekend.
415362,glen,2009-12-26 00:45:00,2641,I would like to go.  I am walking out so i cant go more then about 2mile out with easy walking.
415366,skeeter,2009-12-26 01:09:00,1907,Glen who said you would have to walk? a large timmies with 2 creme and 1 sugar speaks loud ...lol 
415369,bigugli,2009-12-26 01:39:00,6138,Sounds like a lot of fun. Would be nice to do if i can walk it.
415406,Handlebarz,2009-12-26 10:35:00,3790,"Just remember that the 1st annual Bridgenorth Winter Panfish Festival on Feb. 13, 2010. and alot of members might be at that and not able to make it out that day. Depending on the day it would be nice to make it over to Simcoe heck if I can go i would pick up some people along the way from Chatham even if its just for the day it would not be the first long road trip like that."
415417,Spiel,2009-12-26 12:21:00,9065," Yep, that was me.  I remember spending $100.00 to have some prizes available and then winning $100.00 on a lotto ticket that evening, must have been a ""karma"" thing as I never win anything.  I'd love to do it again but I don't think I'll be up for it this year."
415490,MuskyBill,2009-12-26 18:36:00,311,"Much like Glen, & many others, I'm still a walker. I'm sure there's somewhere within walking distance to get some fish besides Perch. I also like Brian's idea to give something back to the Tyler event. Just because we're not having an actual tournamant doesn't mean we all can't still get in a great day's fishing & donate a l'il something in the end.  I'll keep an eye out for when a date is posted & I'll make sure I'm there. I have a new hut to break in!"
415491,Terry,2009-12-26 18:39:00,14456,that's why the Innisfil spot is good you can walk out to whitefish or perch and the guys with trucks ATVs and snowmobiles can go anywhere on the lake
415523,icedude,2009-12-26 19:58:00,459,Innisfil venue makes sense for a bunch of reasons--we just have to land on a suitable date --end of Feb   Terry (r with a circle after your name)-knew you were famous--didn't know you Trade Marked your name--lol   Thanks
415552,tschirk,2009-12-26 21:58:00,261,So Innisfil seems to be the best choice. Now let's pick a date. I would suggest Feb 6 or 20 (suggest we not fish Feb 13th that's Valentines day weekend). Pls post your preference. Cheers Ted
415555,ChrisK,2009-12-26 22:17:00,2772,I'm in for the the 20th
415556,irishfield,2009-12-26 22:24:00,26272,Yah.. but the 14th is the V day Ted... She's not gonna comply two days in a row ! lol  20th a few will be way up North I imagine. Laker's open the 15th of Feb (zone 11).. which is a Monday this year. Wish They'd just pick the 2nd Saturday or something.. God they spawned back in October..
415930,GoneFishin,2009-12-28 05:58:00,349,I will try to make it out.I'm new to ice fishing and I'm trying to get all of my equipment togeather for this year. I want to try out simcoe but I've never fished it before so this would be an awesome way for me to get some helpful tips and meet some new people. I think the 7th or 21st would be great.
