415640,limeyangler,2009-12-27 03:49:00,5204,"Hi All,  went out today with my buddy Lew, all the toys came out today...and we headed to Dore lake in search of Whitefish and walleye.  The plan was to try a few spots early for whities before the evening walleye bite.....but it took way to long getting in and we only had a few minutes to look for whities before heading to our walleye spot. It Has really dumped snow the last couple of days...upto 2 feet deep on the trail in....we effectively broke trail. Snowdrifts on the lake in some points were as deep as 3', and thew wind was howling at around 20kmh. To make things even slower going it was a balmy -4 C today, the snow was heavy and wet because of the mild temps, so i broke trail and Lew followed on his 4x4.   ALL THE TOYS CAME OUT TODAY      Today we looked for a deep part of the lake and found the break...sure enough...there they were, at the transition point in deeper water 25'-33' FOW...not unlike where you find them before the ice arrives fall fishing.  I have been having the best results with 3""-5"" dace or sucker minnows...its been like walleye candy from around end of October, the walleye still have the feed bag on and are trying to pile on the weight for a long cold winter.  I am fast becoming a convert to jigging raps, and williams spoons , ive been getting them to bite agressively on these (around the 2"" size). i'll break the head off a medium minnow and attach the tail bit to the back hook of a jigging rap...looks like an extension of the lure...only juicy and real...tail gives it a good motion too when hooked just so (this also works killer for Lakers)  On the spoons i dont tend to add any minnow but now and again i'll attach just the head.  an  1/8 jig and minnow has been good too, i have been hooking them just behind the dorsal fin this year instead of in the mouth, through the gill and across the back....i've been catching way more fish this year hooking the minnow like that. We are allowed two lines so this year that has been my dead stick...1/8 oz jig and great big minnow....and i'm experimenting with different lures on my secongd line...jig...jig...jiggin' away.  Anyhoo...here's my usual video diary of this afternoon Shinnanagans....hopefully the bleep outs cover the coarse language at the start....i missed 2 fish....one bit my jiggin' rap, whilst the dead stick line outside the hut was getting dragged in the hole...lol...managed to miss both fish!   REALLY NICE COLORS ON THESE WALLEYE....ALMOST BLACK AND GOLD...AWESOME!  "
