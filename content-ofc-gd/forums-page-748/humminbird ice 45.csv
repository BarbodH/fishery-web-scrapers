416427,Jds63,2009-12-29 16:15:00,1365,Just thought i would pass on this info:  if you purchased a Humminbird ice 45 flasher between September 1 09 and December 31 09 you can mail in for a free carrying bag through Humminbird.  Here is the link:  http://store.humminbird.com/products/26936...4b00885e63b2d52  Looks like I won't get mine until after the ice season (8 -10 weeks for delivery) is done but it'll be nice to have one anyways for next year
416430,trapshooter,2009-12-29 16:25:00,1234,They had the same promotion this time last year and I got mine surprisingly fast.
416433,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-29 16:38:00,0,i'm waiting for the 45 to arrive and i saw that coupon thing...haven't printed it yet but it's definitely an ok promotion.
416437,FisherMike,2009-12-29 16:48:00,108,i just sent away for mine.  hopefully it doesnt take too long.  i got to test out my flasher sunday and monday.  what an awesome unit!!!  the 45 was so easy to use.  i fished a local pond that ive been fishing for years.  i easily caught way more fish than i ever have before on that pond.  i dont know how i ever fished without one.
416446,Jds63,2009-12-29 17:36:00,1365,cool to see we have a few guys with this unit  still havn't used mine but will this weekend ....
416620,duber,2009-12-30 01:14:00,220,Just ordered a 45 myself.Been using a vex fl8-se for a few years and loved it so we'll see how the 45 compares.
416636,xeon,2009-12-30 01:43:00,350,Wheres the free case for the 35... $300 and no $4 case? Buuuuuull.
416664,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-30 02:40:00,0,just got my 45 today.
416679,Meegs,2009-12-30 03:16:00,249,"there is no comparison!    ive fished with vex's and macums and these new hummingbirds blow them outta the water in my opinion.   put the units side by side and what a difference, way easier to control, way easier to see, and the definition.....   WOW!!!!!   digital depth readings...    I bought the 55 last year and man, dont know how i ever got along without it!"
416680,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-30 03:23:00,0,"having seen vex's, my initial impression is good.  as far as appearance and ease of use, this humminbird is real slick.  that digital screen found on the 45 and 55 is what sold me on the unit.  let's see how it works in 100 fow"
416684,Meegs,2009-12-30 03:37:00,249,they work great!     had no issue at all when fishing 98fow last week going for whitefish.   I was still marking my micro trout swivel!
416688,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-30 03:46:00,0,i definitely like hearing + stuff.
