415999,Paully,2009-12-28 15:41:00,712,Anyone own this camera?... I Just purchased one and am curious what i just spent my money on.. 
416016,Jonny,2009-12-28 16:21:00,1380,"Cool camera.  I don't have one, but judging by the Olympus SP-550 I've had for a couple of years now, they make a good quality camera.  I might just have a look at one like yours for extreme weather."
416019,Paully,2009-12-28 16:30:00,712,I just charged the battery for it and been messing around... Its got alot of cool features..and seems easy to use. It has a wide angle shot option that will make for some wicked sunrise pictures or landscape shots. I cant wait to get outdoors and try it out.  Its shock proof from 5 ft. Waterproof up to 10 feet Freezeproof  I've owned 2 other cameras and each have broke from one of the above issues... so i figured that i might as well try it out.
416040,perchslayer666,2009-12-28 17:37:00,280,I bought this camera early this year (kinda pissed now that the camera is $200 cheaper....   ) It's durable and everything you need in a metal housed camera. I need to use mine more.
416046,steelhead hunter,2009-12-28 17:48:00,152,I just got the same one on boxing day not bad for 200 bucks can't wait to try it out
416116,Laker272,2009-12-28 21:27:00,45,"I have had the Olympus Stylus Tough 6000 for a year now. I have never missed a photo because of my camera freezing. I have dropped it on numerous ocassions, no ill-effect to the unit. The underwater photos are great, make amazing release shots like this one. "
416140,spinnerdoc,2009-12-28 22:30:00,556,"i have the older version and i love it, durable and tried it out underwater and i can't complain."
416177,DRIFTER_016,2009-12-29 00:02:00,10439,"I have one of the original Stylus cameras, a Stylus 300 and it is still running strong after 7 years of being beaten on in the outdoors. It was billed as splash proof but not water proof, however it has been submerged to depths of 6 feet and survived with no ill effects. So if the new ones are half as good you're going to love it!!!! I saw that camera in Future Shop last week and the first thought I had was I'll never buy that camera because of the colour!!!! I envisioned putting it down after the shot to release my trophy steelie only to never be able to fid it again due to the como paint job. Give me a bright red or silver one instead!!!"
416214,bucktail,2009-12-29 01:20:00,1857,"Have one and you wll like it , good pictures, battery life is short in the cold but what camera isnt. All my pics are fromit , go thru my albums"
416251,Skud,2009-12-29 02:36:00,739,I bought one four months ago and love it. You will not be disappointed. Take the time to learn all the great features. There's a ton of them
416343,singingdog,2009-12-29 12:16:00,1047,"Well, I guess you don't want to hear this now, but I looked at that camera and decided not to get it based on the reviews in several digital camera mags. Picture quality and lag-time were the 2 main reasons. The tap-control is a cool feature though."
416400,Jonny,2009-12-29 15:14:00,1380,The great thing about the internet is that you can research stuff with very little effort:  http://www.steves-digicams.com/camera-reviews/  I particularly like to check customer reviews:  http://www.amazon.com/Olympus-Stylus-Tough...howViewpoints=0
416408,Jet,2009-12-29 15:26:00,364,I'm looking to upgrade to a point and shoot digital soon as well and found this resource extremely helpful in enlightening me with the differences between the many different waterproof cameras and what you can get for the price you pay. I'm particularly interested in capturing my adventures on video and the test for that is quite comprehensive.  http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/Q209waterproofgroup/
416467,tightline,2009-12-29 18:36:00,322,I have the same camera...Your gonna love it!!!!
416554,wallyboss,2009-12-29 23:38:00,1095,I have the Stylus 1050 I love the camera but the only thing I do not like about it is that it is not Point and shoot.  Can't really get a reaction shot. takes a couple of seconds to take a picture.
416561,Greencoachdog,2009-12-30 00:05:00,8163, Now all you have to do is catch a fish (like that's going to happen  ) and take a pic of it... then post the aforementioned pic so I can tell you you're holding it the wrong way/it's too small/it's OOS/ and your face looks like my dogs butt!
416605,Bondar,2009-12-30 01:03:00,817,"make sure to buy the floatation device for it , cause at water proof camera at the bottom of the lake is still useless. i have the older model and havent had any problems its a good point and shoot camera i use the camera in some pretty cold winter steelhead boat fishing on the niagara i have it inside my float suit to keep the batteries warm or the do go fast !!   http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=9722042"
