415848,irishfield,2009-12-28 01:40:00,26272,"Got out today, onto a Zone 15 lake, with some of the usual suspects. Lloyd, Terry and Lloyd's buddy Drew. Surface didn't look it....safe... but Lloyd spud'd the way out and we found 5 to 6 inches of ice in most places. Sometimes a little less... sometimes a little more. Looks pretty skimpy thru an open hole.. but the picture is of a 6"" thick spot.  Drew caught himself a big rainbow smelt, Myself a little perch and Lloyd a Laker that had to go back to be caught again next weekend for a meal. Terry... he tried!     "
415856,e-z-out,2009-12-28 01:56:00,1052,You Lucky OLD farts always having fun with out a goby to tag along lol  Terry one day you will show them to young whipper snappers a thing or 2 about fishing
415864,Terry,2009-12-28 02:16:00,14456,"Wayne caught a perch I snapped a picture but it doesn't show up in the photo cause it was so small..LOL   Lloyd did get one OOS fish    I played with my new Lowrance  HDS5     what a great fishfinder, even with all the other finders around me I figured out how to get rid of almost all the interferance  can't wait for the ice transducer to be built for me   another fun day on the water"
415867,MuskyBill,2009-12-28 02:20:00,311,"Awesome, can't wait to get out there as well!  Great pics guys..."
415869,Ron,2009-12-28 02:32:00,1683,"Good to hear you boys got out.  All I can do for at least another week is armchair fish! dang!   Terry, can you take a picture of your transducer for me? I want to see how you got it set up.  Cheers, Ron..."
415872,Joey,2009-12-28 02:37:00,9122,"Yep, looks like fun, can't wait to get out there myself.  Looks like enough ice for me  Nice to see you got out there boys!!  Joey"
415877,Terry,2009-12-28 02:39:00,14456,Ron  I just reversed the bracket to balance the transducer then stuck a hunk of styrofoam so it would sit straight in the water it worked pretty well I had too much foam but is fine till my new 83/200 ice transducer comes  
415879,Ron,2009-12-28 02:48:00,1683,"Kewl Thanks Terry!  That looks so much easier than what I did...  Time for some mods...(Hun, move to the side of the bath tub... I got to try something.....)"
415886,fishhunter,2009-12-28 03:26:00,604,I HOPE SO!!!!!!!! BUT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TRY WOULD BE MORE THEN HAPPY TO BRING YOU ALONG NEXT TIME. CALL ME THIS WEEK. ILL BE ON THE ICE FRI SAT SUN
415887,fishhunter,2009-12-28 03:28:00,604,ONCE AGAIN IT WAS GREAT HOOKING UP WITH GREAT FRIENDS FOR A DAY OUT. FISHING WAS SLOW BUT IN THE END THE GETTING TOGETHER OF FRIENDS OUT DOES GOOD FISHING ANY DAY IN MY BOOKS
415888,limeyangler,2009-12-28 03:28:00,5204,"Awesome Wayne!  Certainly is a spooky feeling on less than 8"" of ice.  I'm drooling over your fishfinder.....man is that ever sweet. Come on man...surely an HDS fishfinder deserves the $90 expense to buy a proper 'iceducer'?  Top report......  Thanks man   Here's to many more Ice reports.."
415889,irishfield,2009-12-28 03:31:00,26272,That's Terry's new toy Simon! He's waiting for someone to make him a iceducer.. that hopefully he gets before spring !
415901,Twocoda,2009-12-28 03:59:00,4130,i like the split screen on the finder...quick questions...what do the colours indicate on it ? density? temp change? thermocline? and is that surface temp or is there an option for a temp probe?
415921,Leecher,2009-12-28 05:24:00,7832,Great report and pics Wayne That's what's all about right there.... great time fishing with good friends and even getting into some Just doesn't get any better than that!!! Thanks for sharing Leechman
415925,Moosebunk,2009-12-28 05:39:00,3970,Coooooooooooli---oh!!!  Doods.  Nice seeing the ice reports shift into first and rev up for the coming season.  Terry WILL catch a fish this year I BELIEVE!!!  Good luck in the 2010.  Hopefully I'll get a chance to get out with yas at some point.
415940,Paully,2009-12-28 11:15:00,712,How big was the lake that you were on?
415949,canadadude,2009-12-28 12:36:00,769,"nice way to go, instead of styrofoam try using a piece of foam from a kids swiming noodle, just cut a 6""-8"" piece and attach it the same way with a couple of strips of duct tape. Pretty much makes a copy of the vexilar float set-up"
415955,Terry,2009-12-28 13:01:00,14456,"I am getting a ice transducer built for it  dual 83/200, I could not find one anywhere so it is being built  I made up the foam on it last minute, just to try it and it worked fine, I don't think I will do anything else as I wait for the new ducer  and yes the different colours  tell how hard or soft the bottom is the black line is my small lure when I first start to jig it , the fishfinder sees it as being a bit bigger so it adds some blue and if something is even bigger it show green in it too and if even bigger , yellow will be in the middle of the line, the are about 25 colour schemes you can use, this is just the one that I found easiest to use  but I am still playing/ learning how to use the darn thing but so far , it's great"
415980,solopaddler,2009-12-28 14:17:00,8605,Man it looks comfortable out there on the ice. Great shots Wayne!
415995,johnnyb,2009-12-28 15:26:00,3413,"Nice to see you guys out on the ice...VERY nice toy, Terry!  I was wondering about hanging my skim-ducer from a hunk of foam...now you've proven it works..thanks!  Looks like my old hockey stick is safe...for now...."
416035,irishfield,2009-12-28 17:23:00,26272, I don't know... about 8 miles long... 1/2 to 3/4 mile wide.
416056,Terry,2009-12-28 18:18:00,14456,"that helps  I didn't mention but they blindfolded me on the way there, so I could tell anyone where it is  but I know we went over a river and 2 train tracks on the way there"
416058,irishfield,2009-12-28 18:24:00,26272,That was the same tracks twice ! lol
