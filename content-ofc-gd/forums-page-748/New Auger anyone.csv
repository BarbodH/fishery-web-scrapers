416065,Guest skeeter99,2009-12-28 18:37:00,0,costco in ajax has a skid of power augers  $299 Eskimo's 8 inch  they are in the second last isle before the bread (automotive area) kinda hidden
416070,dagoat_1,2009-12-28 19:06:00,72,I'm in the market for an auger and wondering if anyone has used these and how they compare to the higher end models?
416076,misfish,2009-12-28 19:54:00,29133,"I had one,one pull and go.They are also very light."
416093,dagoat_1,2009-12-28 20:39:00,72,Thanks Misfish.
416095,irishfield,2009-12-28 20:45:00,26272,Is this the 1.2HP Stingray??? or the 1.8hp Maco?
416099,dagoat_1,2009-12-28 20:54:00,72,"Its the 8"" Mako. Just called and sold out in the Barrie location"
416101,Ron,2009-12-28 20:54:00,1683,Costco ice auger  On their web site it shows the Mako 43 cc.  
416108,irishfield,2009-12-28 21:07:00,26272,That's good.. just wanted to caution the 1.2 HP would be lacking for serious ice.
416141,dagoat_1,2009-12-28 22:32:00,72,"Yeah the 43cc is about 1.8hp so should be decent as the other guys stated. Just hope 8"" hole will be sufficient."
416167,richyb,2009-12-28 23:39:00,774,"  I have seen lakers over 20 pounds come out of an 8"" hole. They make a nice SLURP, but they come out."
416441,dagoat_1,2009-12-29 16:57:00,72,"Anyone still interested, Richmond hill location, they still have 11 left. Oh Wait.......only 10 left now"
416708,Jonny,2009-12-30 04:37:00,1380," Before I gave up ice fishing for a time (bad back) I had an 8"" TML power auger that I bought new. It was the sweetest little thing and drilled hundreds of holes, but I can't remember what HP the motor was - I'm assuming it wasn't much more than 1 HP because it was so small! It was 34cc, I think, whatever that puts out.  I could make Swiss cheese out of the ice on lakes around Timmins in March - that's thick ice, believe me!  Maybe the gearing would make a difference too?"
416740,richyb,2009-12-30 13:22:00,774,I have an eskimo barracuda and its an ice eating machine. Everyone with jiffys grab it and cant believe how light it is compared to theirs.
416896,cityfisher,2009-12-30 21:29:00,959,almost bought the eskikmo but got with the BPS 10' strikmaster 2hp.. for 369... 70$ more for more power and more cutting surface
