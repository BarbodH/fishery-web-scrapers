416424,Wendel,2009-12-29 16:00:00,213,"Looking to take my wife ice fishing later this week for her birthday(new years eve actually). We are looking for a place that offers ice cabins, we want to stay one or two nights. We wouldn't mind catching some walleye or some pike.  Any suggestions as to where we should try?  I called a couple of places that I could find, but they were booked up already.  Thanks,  Mark"
