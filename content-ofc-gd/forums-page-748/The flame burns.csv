416669,kickingfrog,2009-12-30 02:51:00,8333,I had the honor to carry the torch when it was in Barrie in 1988. Now almost 22 years later it was back and I shared it with my soon to be 1 year old son. I wonder what will happen in the next 22 years?        We were right by the DQ on Bradford St.
416675,BillM,2009-12-30 03:03:00,17367,"So do they run the torch 24x7 or only during the day?  I missed it in Barrie today, I wanna catch it somewhere else...  Even in the middle of nowhere is good enough for me."

416774,Governator,2009-12-30 15:15:00,879,"That's a great video, thanks for sharing.  Wife and I planned to go originally, but we felt it was just too cold out to take our 4 month old."
416798,ketchenany,2009-12-30 16:42:00,3229,"  They are going to float it down the Notty, get the pin ready."
416827,Tybo,2009-12-30 18:16:00,1373,So i hope that the world Olympic committee is paying for all those cop cars and the police officer that are on overtime. Waste of tax payers money.
