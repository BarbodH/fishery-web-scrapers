416047,BillM,2009-12-28 17:55:00,17367,"Laszlo buddy, you gotta resize those pics  A simple thing I do before I upload them to Photobucket or Imageshack is use Windows itself to resize them..  Select all your pics and right click > send to Mail recipient..  Windows will then ask you if you want to keep the original sizes or to resize.   If you click the little options button on the bottom left there are 3 sizes to choose from.  After picking the sizes, you're default email program will open up with the resized pics as attachments.  Simply select all the pics, then copy into another folder.  Now you have your original pics that aren't 4MB a piece"
416052,laszlo,2009-12-28 18:08:00,487,  Hey Bill. Thanks for the info but they are reduced and looking normal on my computer. I posted them the way I always do. Are they huge on your screen? They start big on my screen and after 5 seconds they reduce to normal size :/  On another note - Any Steelhead for Christmas???
416054,BillM,2009-12-28 18:13:00,17367,"Giant... they are 2592x1944   Biggest they should be is 1024x768....  at least for posting on here (personal opinion)  I got into a few fish yesterday, no pics but a few nice fillets for my neighbour  Also some nice skein for myself!"
416055,laszlo,2009-12-28 18:18:00,487, I'll chop them in half next time...thanks man.  I tried for some T.O. Pike on Sunday with no success. The end of winter is already heavily on my mind.
416059,BillM,2009-12-28 18:24:00,17367,I'll take a few more warmer days like we had last week.  Just enough to break the ice up
