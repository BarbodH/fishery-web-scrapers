416332,pikehunter,2009-12-29 11:03:00,1659,"DanD is correct,  look for signage related to launch rules. Grand Island BBQ Dunnville has a posted sign in regards. Seems that the bottom end of their launch got washed out really bad from power loading and it caused them a buck or two for repairs."
416337,Rich Clemens,2009-12-29 11:50:00,3131,"My trailer has bunks, so I back it down in and submerge the bunks for a couple seconds to make sure they are good and wet.  Then pull forward enough so there is about a foot opr so of the bunks out of the water.  Pull straight in and run it up as far as I can.  Lean over and hook up.   Winch her up all the way.  The one problem I do have is getting her 'exactly'  centered all the time.  The boat sits in between the wheels and I only have maybe 1 inch or so clearance on both sides between the boat and the wheel fenders.   There is carpet to prevent metal to metal rubbing, but too often the boat ends up tight against the wheel.  I really don't want it touching for fear of someday wearing through the carpet covering.  Typically I have to back the boat in a little more and manually try to keep it straight while my wife pulls away.  Sometimes we have to do this a couple times to get it off the wheels.  This is a PITA and sometimes can cause me a delay in getting trailered and out of the way.  There must be that sweet spot and maybe I need to have the bunks out of the water a little more.  I did forget to trim the motor once, but fortunately is was loose gravel when it hit.  A few shouts to my wife, correct my error, and we're good to go.  No damage done (Whew !!!)"
416338,dave524,2009-12-29 11:54:00,4508,"Just asking, what really are the advantages of power loading? I've had a 18 foot aluminum with a V4 outboard for over 25 years, never power loaded or felt the need to. Just back in as close to the dock as you can, barely submerge the rear rollers/bunks, pull out winch line to about 1/2 way down the trailer, go to boat, untie, from dock centre hull between the rollers, keeping tension on the lead line off the bow go to the rear of the vehicle, hitch the line around the winch mast if you need to, hop on the centre beam of the trailer and attach the winch line, winch boat onto trailer removing the lead line just before the hull buries the ring in the masthead, hook up safety chain and go to the tow vehicle and clear the launch area before doing anything else so to not keep anyone waiting. I usually launch by myself. With an open mind I'm asking if there are any real advantages other than a few turns of the winch handle. I always viewed it as a potentially risky method, possibly some macho male rite of passage inspired by TV shows.  Edit: as others mentioned while i was typing, too deep is a problem, you want the hull firmly on the trailer when you pull it out, I rarely get my feet wet standing at the winch at most launches."
416340,Spiel,2009-12-29 11:59:00,9065," I also do this before loading the boat, imagine the friction of the boat running up dry carpet.  My observations show that most troubles at the ramp involve trailers being to deep in the water. I pull up so that most of my trailer fenders are out of the water and approx. half of the bunks are also out. This allows the boat to slip and center itself as it rides up the bunks, near perfect everytime."
416341,Rich Clemens,2009-12-29 12:03:00,3131,  Maybe that's what I need to try the next time - pull 'em out a little father and see if that does the trick.  Thanks Chris.  Ok - Back to Hometownhandyman's thread now.   No intentions of stealing it.
416345,HTHM,2009-12-29 12:28:00,4082,"No steal at  all, this is exactly the type of discussion I was hoping for, I am learning a lot!"
416349,Fish4Eyes,2009-12-29 12:39:00,1022,"1. Back trailer into the water so the bunks are half way in 2. Reverse the boat considerably to give yourself plenty of room to correct the boat incase it is not lining up with the trailer 3. Trim motor up 4. Line up the center of your bow with the front roller on your trailer (if your struggle with this, putting in your bow nav light helps to center it (assuming the nav light is centred at the bow like it is on my boat). 5. Drive the boat approx 3/4 of the way up the trailer. Use the winch the rest of the way."
416356,Garnet,2009-12-29 13:10:00,2056,"The biggest problem is trailer to far in the water.  Couple people were right every trailer has a sweet spot and every launch has a sweet spot.  Most trailer it's just above the axle.  Those bunks are to guide your boat on the trailer. If the bunks are not going to stop your boat before it hits the winch you are in the water to far.  Now idle your boat up to the trailer and slip in to neutral and let the trailer center the boat and stop it.  If your trailers in that sweet spot your boat should stop about FT short of the winch and the boat should be strait if not make corrections and winch or power up that last ft.  Now launching by your self  undo the back of your boat LEAVE THE WINCH ATTACHED TO THE BOAT, back into the water just a little further than your load location. Step on the tongue undo the winch if your boat is sliding back you are in just a little to far just hold your boat and take the winch off. Slide the boat back and step into the boat and start the motor and idle off the trailer. Again every boat has a sweet spot.  By leaving the winch attached you never lose control of your boat and if it doesn't start getting it back on the trailer is easy.  You and somebody that can't drive the boat our handle the vehicle.  Most can back it up that .5 ft to get you off the trailer and pull the trailer away from the launch until you tie off.  If all the bad things are happening, by yourself, wicked current, bad cross wind. DO NOT PUT TRAILER FURTHER IN THE WATER.  Less trailer in the water, all that you want is the trailer to stop your boat, now get the boat strait if it won't stay strait step down on the tongue attach the winch and tighten.  Now back your trailer to it's normal load location and either winch or power on.  The most accidents I've seen launching was  people holding a rope trying to control the boat.  I seen a TV star put a bassboat in the back window of a suburban, trailer to far in the water.  Roller trailer are a whole different game NEVER UNDO THE WINCH.  Seen brand new 26ft Thundercraft bounce down the launch ramp in Bowmanville  and stop about 10 ft short of the water."
415833,HTHM,2009-12-28 01:13:00,4082,How do you learn the skill of driving a boat onto a trailer? What are the common mistakes I need to avoid?
415836,irishfield,2009-12-28 01:22:00,26272,Rule #1.. trim motor as high as you can while still in the water enough to pee! (that's the motor.. not you!).. otherwise props get expensive!  Rule #2.. drive it straight on.. if you don't think you are lined up right.. reverse before it's too late!
415840,moparhawk,2009-12-28 01:29:00,146,I've got a Shorelander Trailer and I will say I get lined up well before I hit the trailer and take her straight in. If I'm off a bit I have to back out a ways and start the process over.
415852,bigfish1965,2009-12-28 01:50:00,3382,"Load guides!! Load guides make it nearly dummy-proof (my kind of accessory!)  I always trimmed up, lined up and just let her go. You kinda get the feel of your trailer after awhile. Plus when on land see how close to the ground your skeg is to get an idea how much you need to trim. Take into account that your prop with pull crap off the bottom if it  is too close and if you are unlucky you could pull up a small rock and ding your prop."
415857,Dara,2009-12-28 01:57:00,3052,Stay calm if things go wrong...don't push the throttle the wrong way when excited
415865,Radnine,2009-12-28 02:17:00,1538,"I found that owning and operating a boat (and trailer) was a lot like becoming a dad; I didn't know bugger all about it when I started, but just fell into it rather quickly. I think that you learn a lot about it through osmosis and without realizing. That is to say that you have been around it so long that you picked it up without realizing, then when it becomes time you just do it. I am not sure that I follow you though, I mean you have a boat and trailer, no? Jim"
415873,ccmtcanada,2009-12-28 02:37:00,7971,Do what I did....start out with a really inexpensive boat and motor...lol.  Haven't dinged a prop yet...but then again if there's any question I don't try it.  I can't trim up my motor...it's either down or all the way up...so I have to be careful what launches to do that on.
415892,fishinfool,2009-12-28 03:48:00,366,"It's also very important how far into the water you back your trailer, you will get to know after a while where the bunks should be in relation to the water level to make it easy to load. Practice Makes Perfect lol Good Luck"

415933,danc,2009-12-28 06:13:00,4677,"Cross winds are your worst enemy here. You really have to know your boat and motor and their power. Sometimes you have to gun it, sometimes you have to go full reverse."

415948,DanD,2009-12-28 12:33:00,2223,"One thing that hasn’t been mentioned yet; before you attempt power loading the boat, is check with the ramp operator/owner. Most don’t care; but I know of a few places, that if you try power loading; they’ll tear a strip off you that will not be forgotten. I’m speaking from experience; my ears are still ringing from an incident, in Port Stanley. All I did was give the throttle a good short shot after I was lined up and he acted like; I hit the trailer at full throttle, man was he pissed. They all have their reasons, for not allowing power loading; some are crap, some have merit; but it is their place and I guess: if we want to use it, we should follow their rules.  Dan."
415950,mbac31,2009-12-28 12:36:00,904,Thats correct Dan. Sparrow lake launch(Lauderdale ) I beleive will take a conneption fit if doing power loading. Good point.

416029,fishboy,2009-12-28 17:18:00,550,  I go half to two-thirds in the water...I find it almost easier if I'm a little on the shallow side; otherwise the bunks are too deep to guide the boat up on the trailer.
416039,EE_,2009-12-28 17:37:00,36,Cool concepts...here's one    Gotta agree with Rick & DanC...loading guides is a must!
416048,smally21,2009-12-28 17:58:00,993,"all of our custom trailers included delivery. we found if we left it to the customer they said the trailer didn't work, or fit.  so every trailer got fitted and every customer got a lesson on launching and recovery.  after about 400 trailers and trips to countless boat ramps i got to the point where i could load/unload inside of 2-3 minutes.  to launch i give out 4-5 ft of slack in the winch line prior to backing down into the water. (lock the winch!)  back up til the boat just floats.  dry bunks and even rollers are like glue, she's not going too fall off . board the boat from the bow or dock, lean over and uncouple the winch line (or have someone else on the tongue do it for you).  the few feet of slack insures the bow eye doesn't hang up on the bow roller.  start motor at high trim level and you are off.  if your reversing skills are good just push it to the dock if you like.  to recover, lay out 6-8 feet of winch line, lay it over the first cross member.  back up AS STRAIGHT AS POSSIBLE, until the front bunks, rollers disappear.  they are now wet and will slide better.  pull forward until you can see about 1 foot of bunk out of the water.  this is probably the most important thing, you are now driving a triangle into a rectangle and it has no choice but to center itself!  now drive the boat onto the trailer as straight as possible, at a reasonable speed but enough to still be able to steer.  it being perfectly straight right off the bat is not critical, because as you retrive with the winch the boat will center itself as it climbs the bunks.  once im hooked up on the bunks (maybe with some helpful, but gentle throttle) i walk to the bow, lean over and grab the winch line  i layed out earlier. hook it to the bow eye and exit the boat, either from bow to tongue or via the dock. standing on the tongue with the winch in low gear slowly and steadily bring the boat up.  let the bunks do the work of straightening the boat.  absolutely jam it up to the bow roller as the bow will climb when you leave the water. (proper trailer setup is important).  if it gets too difficult to crank, get back in the truck and back up a foot or two, as the boat is already straight and up on the bunks you shouldn't lose your center.  put on your safety and slowly climb the ramp.  if not perfectly centered, back up and float the boat again (just barely!) and repeat the process.  good luck hope you get lots of practice!  and everyone remember the ramp is not the place to mess around with your bumpers and bait! get the dutch off the ramp when you're done!!"
416139,Sinker,2009-12-28 22:21:00,8692," Most important tip right there. In too far is trouble, out too far is trouble. There is a sweet spot, you have to find it.  S."
416144,Tybo,2009-12-28 22:37:00,1373,"The easiest way, is roller  will electric winch. Roller trailers are harder on the boats hull. Due too the small pressure points. I had a 21ft glass boat this way. It also fall off at the launch. All unhooked and a friend holding the bow line. Kid ran behind the boat,I touch the brake's and off went the boat."

416282,GBW,2009-12-29 03:53:00,8460,"the funny thing for me is, I was told to ""go take the boat to the launch and meet your father"" one day and it just hit me as to how to land the boat on the trailer.  It didn't take long at all (as long as you are comfortable in the boat) and it should only take a few minutes. Trim, speed and wind is key.  Not being afraid is the biggest thing..."
