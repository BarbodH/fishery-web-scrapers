416868,Terry,2009-12-30 20:05:00,14456,now you take the link from photobucket and place it in your post it needs tags or put the link in the photo box above the text area http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/style_i...mage-button.png
416877,Greencoachdog,2009-12-30 20:32:00,8163,The URL that you paste from photobucket should look like this:  [ IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v203/greencoachdog/DSC01933.jpg[/img ]  I threw in a couple of extra spaces so it wouldn't be a pic. Paste it to a line by itself like I did here!
416882,vinnimon,2009-12-30 20:57:00,2593,I will give photobucket a shot.I doing photos one at a time.
416885,Greencoachdog,2009-12-30 21:07:00,8163," If you're going to upload pics to photobucket, use the bulk uploader... it's faster and easier!"

416598,Greencoachdog,2009-12-30 01:01:00,8163,"Photobucket really works for me Vinni, when posting an avatar pic use the direct link.  If you should decide to get a photobucket account, use the bulk uploader... it's much easier to upload a bunch of pics at one time."

416615,GBW,2009-12-30 01:10:00,8460,"if you read the fine print in my ""signature"" you can also see another site to make a signature.  use photobucket for everything else."
