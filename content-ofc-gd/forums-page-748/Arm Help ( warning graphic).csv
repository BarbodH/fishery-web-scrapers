416573,Michael_Brown,2009-12-30 00:25:00,411,"Nice staple job. Did you do that yourself? I have seen lots of broken arms and wrists in my line of work and you need to wait for a while to heal. Usually they don't want you to move your fingers too much. Since it has been 3-4 weeks your probably looking at some major physiotherapy to get your fingers moving properly again. It may take a while, if ever to regain full motion. Remember that some people who break their legs that badly still have a limp after long term recovery. At least your still walking on the grass instead of fertilizing it. You will have to join Ron on the OFC injured reserve list.  Of course one sympton of the major concussion is that maybe your thumb never worked right in the first place.  Better ask a friend.  Work on using the remote control with your left hand, it might be a long winter.   Take care."

416722,ChrisK,2009-12-30 10:23:00,2772,"Bucktail, Meant to mention this earlier in the thread but my toy poodle just when through the same ordeal. Sam my Lab was playing with him outside when I heard a yelp...The poodle comes running in the back door with his left front leg dangling.....Anyhow, send him off to Guelph animal hospital for a rebuild on the leg which consisted of a couple steel plates and 8 weeks in a cast and he was a good as new. My wife Carol does look a little concerned in this pic. You'll be fine brother !!! "
416731,Daplumma,2009-12-30 12:25:00,1961,"Ouch!I can tell you this,I had surgery for a trigger finger release and had numbness and pain in the fingers next to the one that had the surgery.Any inflamation where the tendons go thru sleeves in your wrist and fingers will press on nerves and cause pain and numbness.Go see a doctor,there are ways to help this along. Joe"
416769,NAW,2009-12-30 15:00:00,4022,"I broke my wrist a few years back while snowboarding.  It was a compound fracture, and both bones where completely broken, really close to my wrist.  I also managed to crush my Median nerve.  I couldn’t feel my fingers for weeks, and when then odd bit of feeling came back, it was excruciating.  Nerve damage can cause some intense sensations.  If you’re concerned, then go see a doctor.  I saw my orthopedic surgeon every two weeks when I was in my cast.  So there was never a period of time for me to get worried, as I was always being looked at by doctors.  There is a very slight chance they screwed up, by not likely."

After a slip down the stairs of my deck I managed a massive concusssion and broke my wrist and forearm. Had surgery to plate up both the  wrist and arm. It has been 3.5 weeks now and I have full motion in my fingers but I still cant use my thumb at all, when I try to move it it hurts like hell in my forearm. Question is , is it possible one OFC the dozen screws is stuckin my thumb tendon? BTW its my right hand of course , this post tokk 20 minutes to type!!       darren"

416212,aplumma,2009-12-29 01:14:00,6896,sorry to see the bad luck....you really need to talk to the doctor about the lack of movement it might be from inflammation or something else. Best to not guess since a hand without a thumb is a paw....   Art

416255,uglyfish,2009-12-29 02:45:00,981,"give it some time... they wouldnt get a screw in the tendon as that would be a big mistake on their end, and u would be in a far greater amount of pain as that wouldnt be somethin u would sit around with. eberything is connected. and ur thumb is connected to the wrist and the fore arm, it will take longer for u to get pain free movement in ur thumb then ur fingers. if ur really that worried about it, go see ur doc. but really, it just needs more time to heal."

416379,JohnF,2009-12-29 14:31:00,3494,"I'm no doc but I've been sitting here flexing my thumb and fingers and feeling where the tension is in my forearm. The thumb pulls way off to the side while the fingers pull straight up the inside. I'm thinking that if the major trauma was in the area of the thumb muscles (or whatever) then what you're getting is just the effect of the swelling, the body making it's own immobilizing cast.  When I tore my achilles tendon some years ago the doc told me it would bother me for a year, and it was almost exactly a year to the day before I realized I no longer has any kind of discomfort there. I doubt any of this has any relevance in your case but I suppose it might. Hopefully you're just experiencing something like that and after the healing is done all will be well.  JF"
416421,Cookslav,2009-12-29 15:50:00,1457," I've been the unfortunate recipient of a few broken bones in my life, and would concur this statement.... I lost motion of toes, after a broken ankle injury for about 5 weeks, and it was exsactly this cause.  Your Dr. will be able to confirm this when you head in for your follow up though. Its entirely possible there is tendon damage neededing repair as well, but they won't touch that until the Bones are taken care of usualy.  Good luck and take it easy."
416550,Greencoachdog,2009-12-29 23:29:00,8163,It takes old people a lot longer to heal than young people.. not that I would know anything about getting old!  At 3.5 weeks you're just beginning to heal... give it time   .. and start drinking heavily!!!
