416180,EC1,2009-12-29 00:09:00,930,"exactly what happened to me today. Saw 2 fish hooked, and maybe missed a handful of hits between all of the people fishing at 1 hole."
416192,Leecher,2009-12-29 00:34:00,7832,Kind of mild up here today but dipping into another deep freeze overnight..... should be good to go tomorrow Leechman
416225,MJL,2009-12-29 01:38:00,2427,Definitely tough fishing today – Currently slathering on layer after layer of hand moisturizer from all the wind burn – I need better gloves.  Got my car stuck in the muddy/icy parking lot for an hour and a half too which didn’t make things fun – 2 anglers came by and helped push me out to freedom. Hit up 1 Lake O trib  between 7am to 2pm and landed 2 bows (1 big hen in the morning which took me down river a bit away from my backpack & camera  - Perhaps my biggest bow of 2009  ... also got 1 small male in the afternoon)…Saw/heard of 7-8 other fish caught there all day amongst 20-25 other anglers I ran into.  Both fish were caught on a bait I’ve nicknamed ‘the creature’  .  Nothing touched the roe bags I tied up last night.  Actually it’s been a month since I last caught a fish with roe – Highly irregular compared to past falls/winters.  Here’s a pic of the buck…Perhaps my last fish of 2009   When in doubt…GO FOR IT!  Best way not to hear “should’ve been here yesterday” is to fish everyday

416265,GBW,2009-12-29 03:02:00,8460,"very cool, CHEERS!"
416269,MJL,2009-12-29 03:13:00,2427," Awesome man!…Didn’t realize it was you. Good meeting you, Christian as well as seeing your buddy Tyler again...Can’t thank you guys enough for your help.  Mike"
416301,eyeforelle,2009-12-29 04:25:00,38,"just for the heads up, consider buying a bag of salt and leave it in your trunk. If your by yourself next time and are stuck, just lay a bunch down around your tires and wait a few minuets. A small shovel doesn't hurt either."
416309,EC1,2009-12-29 05:11:00,930,Nice fish Mike! Those 'creatures' are pretty damn scary when I first saw them. Lol.
