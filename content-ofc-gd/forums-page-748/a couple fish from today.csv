416357,walleye_man,2009-12-29 13:21:00,135, iv been watching them on the under water camera as well and iv noticed theve been takeing bigger baits like small spoons other than tiny jigs and if they wont take that just try a small minnow most of the times theyll take that good luck out therer

416884,Greencoachdog,2009-12-30 21:05:00,8163, Y'all can have my share of that Bubba Paul!    Shouldn't you be outside taking pics with that new camera son?... or is there just so many pics you can take of snow?  I can explain to you how to post them if you'd like... but who would want to admit that they're dumber than an ol' Possum eatin' Redneck?
