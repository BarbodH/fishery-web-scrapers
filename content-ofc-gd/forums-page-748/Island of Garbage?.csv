Despite its size and density, the patch is not visible from satellite photography because it consists of very small pieces, almost invisible to the naked eye [2] and most of its contents are suspended beneath the surface of the ocean.""  http://www.vbs.tv/watch/toxic/toxic-garbage-island-1-of-3 http://www.vbs.tv/watch/toxic/toxic-garbage-island-2-of-3 http://www.vbs.tv/watch/toxic/toxic-garbage-island-3-of-3"

I haven't got time to check out the links but will  a little later. This is a link to the algalita marine research foundation. They've done some of the most comprehensive research to date on the gyre and are IMO the definitive authority on this subject. Thanks for bringing this up Dr. Salvenious.
