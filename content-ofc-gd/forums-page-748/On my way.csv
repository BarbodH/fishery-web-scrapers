416682,irishfield,2009-12-30 03:30:00,26272,Have fun John... call the airline and see what you can carry on. It's getting pretty nuts.. or is that petting..
416683,JohnF,2009-12-30 03:32:00,3494, I'll look for the gate with a cute security lady.  JF
416686,JohnF,2009-12-30 03:38:00,3494, I've never thought of them as pretty.  We already checked and since we're flying out of the US it seems like we'll be ok. We'll see when we get to security I guess. Hopefully by the end of the montth things will have calmed down. We're only taking one big bag each and a backpack. If they hassle us we'll take the computer and the cameras out and send the backpacks thru checked luggage. We always fly Continental and apparently we can still check 2 bags each no extra charge.
