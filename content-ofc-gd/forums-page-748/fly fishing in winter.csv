416118,shadowfly,2009-12-28 21:28:00,84,Hey guys it's my first winter fly fishing. i was wondering if any of you had any tips regarding how to prevent the guides from icing .  I'm thinking there isn't a way to prevent that. maybe just minimize the amount of ice forms. any help would be greatly appreciated thanks in advance tight lines

416122,shadowfly,2009-12-28 21:35:00,84,"cool thanks for the tip , any brand in particular?"
416125,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-12-28 21:40:00,1107,I'm cheap I use lipchap instead of just buying the right stuff and lipchap doesn't work that good I'm going to try vaseline tomorrow to see if it's any better but not expecting it to be any better ask your tackle shop they wil know which is better.

Easy to apply, just strip your line through it in your hand. Just a FYI... Bees wax is easily found at any lumber or hardware store, even Canadian Tire. Wax setting seals for toilets is made from bees wax."

416206,ped,2009-12-29 01:09:00,16,I had the same problem today when I was learning to fly fish at Bluffers park!

Every three to four casts I de-ice with a cotton rag I have attached to my vest.  Just make sure you remove the ice in an upward motion.  My buddy snapped his tip the other day by sliding his rag downward."
