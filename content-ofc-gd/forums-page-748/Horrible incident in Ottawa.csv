The officer was stabbed today in the emergency room at the Civic Campus of the Ottawa Hospital at about 4:30 a.m. ET.

Gregson's lawyer confirmed to CTV News that his client was being held by Ottawa police.  The officer was stabbed to death early Tuesday morning outside the Civic Campus of the Ottawa Hospital while sitting in his cruiser around 4:30 a.m. ET.  The officer was writing in his police notebook when he was ambushed by a single man and stabbed to death, police say.  The suspect was apprehended with the help of bystanders, including two paramedics. The paramedics tried to revive the officer, but were unable to. He was pronounced dead at about 5:30 a.m.  No charges have yet been laid.  Footage of the scene showed a flashlight, gun, notebook, a single glove, two knives and a large stain of blood on the gravel.  The officer's name, age and rank will not be released until relatives are notified.  Police will offer a further briefing later Tuesday morning when further information becomes available.  Gregson, 43, used to work for the RCMP at their Regina headquarters. In 2006, he was arrested for pulling a knife on a Mormon church official in Regina.  He received a conditional discharge after explaining to the court that he had recently undergone brain surgery for cysts on his brain.  A visibly shaken Ottawa Police Chief Vern White told a morning news conference that Tuesday's incident is ""an overwhelming tragedy.""  ""Police forces are like family,"" White told CTV News Channel later in the morning. ""We often fight and argue but always, there is this bond and connection like families have.""  He said this incident will be most difficult on the officers from the same platoon as the deceased officer.  ""It'll be a tough time, particularly over the next few days as they try to work through their own emotions and get through the morning,"" he said.  Flags outside the Ottawa Police headquarters on Elgin St. are flying at half-mast.  This is the first time an Ottawa police officer has been killed in the line of duty since 1983.""   Tom"
