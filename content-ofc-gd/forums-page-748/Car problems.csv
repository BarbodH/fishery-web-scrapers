416668,richyb,2009-12-30 02:48:00,774,My mom has a 2001 intrepid and it stalls out when you slow down fast ( ie. turning off the highway). SHe can drive it around all day in town and its fine. Just when she gets goin down the highway and goes to turn off it idles right down and dies when she takes her foot off the gas. Also it is only after the car gets hot. Any ideas?
