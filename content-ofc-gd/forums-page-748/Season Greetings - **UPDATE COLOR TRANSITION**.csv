For me was all about my family, good company, good food and a few drinks  Did manage to hit the hard stuff on the 24th in the afternoon for a couple of hours but did not get sniff     Had a good time and felt great to be back at it     Weather wise is not the greatest up here so I kind of refrain from going fishing..... but later in the week will certainly give it a go  Had a lot of rain and freezing rain coming down on boxing day so decided to remain in doors and tackle another wooden project.... this time wanted to make crank baits similar to BigO's, but not the same I did last summer..... wanted to make it a copy cat of the original..... well I came close.... here's the results:      Now needs a coat of color and they are good to go!!! Will keep you posted on the development Hope you enjoy! Leechman  ******************************************************************************* @@@@@@ UPDATE @@@@@@ *******************************************************************************  After a few coats of color..... here is the transition results Under belly orange    Chartreuse on top    Not quite finish.... but almost    Got some little details to work out.... will keep you posted on the development Leechman"

416208,fishinguypat,2009-12-29 01:10:00,547,crankbaits are hardest to make  because the lip has to be cut to get the right action

416250,ColdH20guy,2009-12-29 02:34:00,312,looks great! well done... how does one get started in doing that right from the start? thanks
416271,Leecher,2009-12-29 03:16:00,7832," Thanks ColdH20guy!!!  To do this right, you need the proper tools to under take such project (i.e. bandsaw, press drill, jobmate with dremmal etc...)  otherwise you ain't going to achieve the results that you had anticipated.... also, time and patience is another factor and that's about all is required.
