416362,LucG,2009-12-29 13:41:00,779,Sweet! Looks like those rocks might have been a little slippery.  What month was that photo taken in?
416372,frozen-fire,2009-12-29 14:07:00,542,Cool pics...what compels them to jump in and swim? Exploring different territory? Islands?
416425,Muskieman,2009-12-29 16:08:00,2472, First weekend of August.
416426,Muskieman,2009-12-29 16:12:00,2472,  I think you're right on both assumptions.  the pic is blurry but there is also a Doe here but she was ashore already.... he may have been chasing her.    RFS 
416495,fisher,2009-12-29 20:12:00,451,Check this theory as to why the deer was swimming in Lake Ontario...happened last year off Port Credit.  http://www.thestar.com/News/Ontario/article/449503  I think there was talk after that rescue that the two involved were going to be charged for interfering with the deer (not sure that ever happened)
