416658,splashhopper,2009-12-30 02:26:00,2931,  Hey jj.... looking forward to it.  thanks
413401,splashhopper,2009-12-19 02:11:00,2931,"I saw this mentioned on another board.... i know... this is the ONLY board,,, but hey... i was bored...   I already own an 18 v lithium powered hand drill( 2 batteries) and wonder if adapting an auger would actually work.  Does anyone have any experience with this?  Thanks  Splashhopper"
413403,irishfield,2009-12-19 02:13:00,26272,Just look at that punky spring ice he's barely drilling through. Leave the hand crank on  ! .. or buy a proper power auger.
413411,bigugli,2009-12-19 02:29:00,6138,If you don't mind burning out your drill after a few holes.
413412,splashhopper,2009-12-19 02:30:00,2931,  the drill?  or the batteries?
413414,splashhopper,2009-12-19 02:31:00,2931,"  Not sure I am gonna be ""hooked"" on ice fishin yet....  so  i want to keep the costs to a the bare minimum this year.... slow season for work is winter time for me too"
413416,bigugli,2009-12-19 02:34:00,6138,"Try both.  Drained first battery after 3 holes, burned out drill on the 4th.  DOH!  Typical of most ""amazing"" TV offers"
413426,GBW,2009-12-19 02:46:00,8460,I got a free drill that works great so I had my cousin cut a small part off the internal part of the grip and fabricate a bit for a 3/8 dril.  I'll let you know (if you want) how it works out.
413427,Fang,2009-12-19 02:46:00,1330,"Free Time Sports in Woodstock had a sale on $49.99 for brand new ice augers, 5-8"" sizes. Saw it on Kijiji - Ice Augers under London  You'll get your money back on that one if you don't like ice fishing"
413424,splashhopper,2009-12-19 02:46:00,2931,
413432,splashhopper,2009-12-19 02:50:00,2931,  let me know....  I don;t think I will be on ice thicker than8-12 inches....  Local conservation areas to start I think
413434,GBW,2009-12-19 02:52:00,8460,"Sure, will do. All he did was cut off the bottom portion of the handel that goes in the shaft of the auger and welded a 3/8 drill bit into it.  Not to hard at all if you can weld...  How does it work, we will see..."
413446,Dara,2009-12-19 03:39:00,3052,"Come on...a 6"" auger will drill a hole through 3' of ice with little effort. Why mess with a drill. I used to drill 8"" holes for my kids all day long"
413472,jjcanoe,2009-12-19 05:49:00,744,Splashhopper I'll take you guys out to a honey hole for Crappie in the new year!  Don't waste the $$$ on the drill adapters I've heard nothing but bad things about them.  jjcanoe
413503,dave524,2009-12-19 13:56:00,4508,  Maybe you could cut a hole with a Slap Chop ?  Why have a boring life ?
416422,muer,2009-12-29 15:57:00,1,"Maybe I am a bit late, just want to give my one cent.  I bought a 6"" drill, I made an adaptor out of a metal bar. 19.2V Jobmate drill powered by two 12V UPS battery connected in series which equals to 24V DC.  Consulted a professor, specialized in AC and DC motor and generators,  for this configuration and was told o.k. if don't run too long and stuck for too long.  I brought it to Barrie for perch. Drilled 6 holes with ease, drill didn't burn, neither the battery.  3-5 inches ice.  The only problem was that I didn't get a little warmer from drilling, I still need to run about to keep warm after that.  Here are the pictures, if you can't read, please don't read.  As  you can see, I kept my batteries in a warm bag. This is very necessary on ice.  http://chineseanglersclub.ca/forum/dispbbs...7958&page=1   Below is my second DIY for an auger adaptor, using an impact wrench adaptor. I tested this twice but proved not working well. The so called impact wrench adaptor is a joke, plus the connections make the proccess very shaky. Here is my second approach. Again, focus on the pictures, not the words. http://chineseanglersclub.ca/forum/dispbbs...7966&page=1  Thanks"
416443,Curtis,2009-12-29 17:20:00,83,"I diss agree with it being a bad idea. But i dont disagree with not buying an adapter make your own..  All i did was cut three inches of the bottomw of my handle off at the first notch no one uses them set that high.. Then i took a socket extention cut off the big part and had it welded onto the small piece of the handle.  You need a high priced drill or its a waste of time cheaper ones wont cut it.. I can get about 25 holes out of three batteries.. Thats with 12"" ice - I see you have lithium batteries thats what i use.. Cant beat them. I have been banging the idea around my head of plugging the inverter into the quad and running it with a power drill"
416450,fishinguypat,2009-12-29 17:47:00,547,are you kidding you guys must have cheap drills if you can't do many holes with a drill attachment. i have a few drills and many batteries and i can say the drill does matter ...and battery.
416483,shane,2009-12-29 19:23:00,652,This thread is boring.
416484,shane,2009-12-29 19:27:00,652,"Hahahaha!  Boring, Get it?  Actually, I think this is a good idea.  I remember my Dad giving up ice-fishing because he was 'getting to old to drill all those holes'  with his hand auger and he didn't want to get a power one.   He would have loved this ."
416486,Twocoda,2009-12-29 19:34:00,4130,just get an extention for a 1/2 inch drill bit so you can get all the way through the ice to the water...surely you can fit your line down that unless your using 5/8 rope for line  funny fireball
416491,canadadude,2009-12-29 19:59:00,769,"The secret to using a drill to punch holes is use a a top quality comerical drill, I mean a $350-$400 dewalt pro 1/2"" 18 volt drill, with this unit you can punch 10-20 holes and still have a drill. Cheaper mastercraft 18 volts will just blow up under the pressure of a 8-6"" auger, do yourselfs a favour dudes buy a freaking auger, to drill with a drill you can buy an auger for the same price and trust me if I got a sweet $350.00 dewalt drill the last thing I want to do is smoke it drilling ice. Buy a auger there built for ice fishing thats the whole deal"
416518,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-12-29 22:14:00,1362,"Do yourself a favour and buy an axe with a fiberglass handle...much cheaper, will last a lifetime and you can use it for a variety of applications year round.....you'll also get in shape. What more can ya ask for???"
416530,Twocoda,2009-12-29 22:47:00,4130,  safety glasses?

416657,splashhopper,2009-12-30 02:25:00,2931,I should mention.... Ryan is selling me his auger and an old fish finder to get me started.  Thanks for the suggestions.
