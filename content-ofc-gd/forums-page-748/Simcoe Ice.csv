415834,TEP,2009-12-28 01:14:00,68,Going to Gilford tomorrow. Anyone have an update on the ice?  Thanks.
415863,Tom McCutcheon,2009-12-28 02:15:00,627,"Jef go to the ""COOKS BAY ICE FISHING"" forum and check it out. Peter runs his cabins out of Gilford. The last I checked they had about 3.5 to 5 inches of good ice. That was yesterday. Should be better after today.  Tom."
415884,TEP,2009-12-28 03:14:00,68,Thanks Tom!
416243,TEP,2009-12-29 02:21:00,68,"BTW, Fishing today was awesome. 100+ up thru the hole. Kept a small pail for dinner. Out from Gilford. 4-6"" of ice. Fin-S rubber and jiggin Raps made them snap!"
416248,Skud,2009-12-29 02:27:00,739,"Yes, thanks to a handsome guide(wink,wink)"
416252,Fish Farmer,2009-12-29 02:41:00,2234,"Way to go Jeff, Congrats. I should be up this week."
416258,Skud,2009-12-29 02:46:00,739,Here is the happy fisherman.  The dark line behind him is open water.    Here I am trying to find some keepers in the flurry of action.     I would rather be back where I was yesterday in South Carolina.  
416281,Ron,2009-12-29 03:52:00,1683,"Gesus Doug,  I fell your pain..... having to fish with TEP would have been very painful! ha ha ha  Musta been nice to spend a day or 2 golfing and then a flight back home to get on the ice and fish for Perch! - NOT ha ha ha  I take it the trip wasn't long enough.  Cheers, Ron..."
416305,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-29 04:50:00,2582,  Congrats  Jef. It killed me having to work today   Good on you guys for getting into them. Perch are by far my fav freshwater fish for the table.
416487,motion,2009-12-29 19:47:00,403,Any word on current ice conditions for Lefroy/Gilfordarea? Looking to head up there this weekend if it's safe.  Thanks.
