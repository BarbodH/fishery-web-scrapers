419175,MCTFisher9120,2010-01-06 14:50:00,3761," It's weird that way. For a friend of mine only a solid green colored tube jig he can throw all summer long, when he tries other colors for similar amounts of time he catches barely any fish...I can be the same when it comes to color on baits sometimes."
419222,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-06 18:31:00,0,"confidence in your presentation is key.  the lure is 75%, your confidence and effort make up for the other 25. obviously both cleos and pimples have a caught a lot of people a lot of fish. pimples are excellent to jig, tipped with a minnow tail though anders.  i'm surprised you haven't had more luck, especially in some of the smaller lakes (for example where we bumped into you last year)... i like the gold or the silver with orange tape."
419227,anders,2010-01-06 19:05:00,1168,"I know they work...ive seen them, and fished with guys in which thats all they use for lakers or specks, I just cant seem to get them to work for me and ive tried.  thats all right though..the arsenal is large and loaded."
419254,Eazy,2010-01-06 20:38:00,260, White Swedish Pimple with the orange sticker+piece of minnow= Lakers!
418078,Eazy,2010-01-03 04:14:00,260,"IGot to try these spoons out on some early season splake, they were definitely a hit!.......Can't wait to try them on other species during the hardwater season, might just have a new go-to bait!"
418079,irishfield,2010-01-03 04:16:00,26272,Dang.. you don't say !
418082,TEP,2010-01-03 04:25:00,68,I like 'em!
418139,getnjiggywithit,2010-01-03 13:26:00,18,This is one I got first ice on a buckshot 
418151,MCTFisher9120,2010-01-03 14:17:00,3761,"I bought 3 of them the other weekend, hope they will work for me through the ice and maybe panfish in March fishing open water."
418157,Terry,2010-01-03 14:32:00,14456,they didn't help me on Friday
418169,fishboy,2010-01-03 15:15:00,550, great for Simcoe perch
418178,troutboy,2010-01-03 15:41:00,125,Those things are amazing with hard water brookies!
418187,kickingfrog,2010-01-03 15:56:00,8333, And no one is surprised.
418188,Terry,2010-01-03 15:57:00,14456,psssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhh  LOL
418198,Eazy,2010-01-03 16:26:00,260, Which color pattern worked best for you?
418268,Fisherpete,2010-01-03 19:45:00,1814,Lake Simcoe trout HATE them LOL
418313,Joeytier,2010-01-03 22:31:00,3990,My go-to spoon for walters.
418481,Blake,2010-01-04 12:37:00,418,Great bait for sure.  We sell tons of them a year at Fishing World and most people are very successful.  Make sure if you decide to tip them with a minnow only use a minnow head!!!!  If not you will wreck the action on them.  Another cool trick to do is to take the treble off and attach a 3-6 inch dropper line to a single hook with a full minnow hooked through the back.  Deadly on eyes and perch.
418487,Hawg Hunter,2010-01-04 13:41:00,204,quinte walleye love em as well  Hawg Hunter
418492,anders,2010-01-04 14:09:00,1168," They are the first lure i grab for for specks...jiggin line and set lines...they are dynamite for me.   As for colours...the greyish one, and the green/yellow are the best for me....deadly little lure."
418542,trapshooter,2010-01-04 16:57:00,1234,There's not a fish that swims that won't eat a rattle spoon tipped with a minnow.  Definitely a staple in my hardwater arsenal.
418596,MCTFisher9120,2010-01-04 20:09:00,3761,I think the name was Lindy Rattlin Flyer spoon...but I bought one of those in a orange color...That's it for Ice tackle for me!  I think this is a spoon that a friend of mine used last season and had great success with...kind of oval in shape
418759,Eazy,2010-01-05 03:36:00,260,"I'll have to see.....But I think these spoons just might rival the ""old faithful"" Swedish Pimple?"
418806,anders,2010-01-05 13:43:00,1168,Swedish pimple's make me shutter with disappointment.
418836,troutologist,2010-01-05 15:17:00,951,anders the last few years the gold pimple (small size) with textured gold foil has been deadly on lakers in the park....both open and hardwater. Pretty eye opening as I've had no luck on them until then.
418860,troutboy,2010-01-05 17:14:00,125,"   I use the small minnow pattern and the flourecent green and orange work pretty good with a tipped leech,worm or small minnow!"
418916,kevin booth,2010-01-05 20:40:00,57,"quinte walleye and perch love them as well,great lures."
419071,Eazy,2010-01-06 03:16:00,260," I think it so funny how one lure can work so good for one angler, then totally not for another.....The Pimple and you is kinda like me and the Cleo......LOL!"
419174,anders,2010-01-06 14:31:00,1168, Thats hilarious....i Love Cleos
