Here are a few pics to get you interested in the Bay of Quinte  :wink: If you are interested in any tips or have any questions just send me a PM.  Be safe out there and have fun...  Cheers, Hodgey...                    Here's what happens when you're passionate enough to actually try and kiss and 1lb walleye...and it's bites you on the lip!! LOL "
418840,johnnyb,2010-01-05 15:23:00,3413,I DO have a question Hodgey....how come you don't catch as many big fish as Jeff_C does?   :lol:    j/k
418843,kmarr,2010-01-05 15:28:00,11,nice bunch of fish guys
418844,hodgey,2010-01-05 15:36:00,10,"Hey Jonnyb,  Jeff and his team are great on the ice, I would certainly not take that away from them. We've also had some great days so far this year.  It's not about me or Jeff, it's about guys getting out and having a good time. Better than a day in the office.  Cheers, Hodgey..."
