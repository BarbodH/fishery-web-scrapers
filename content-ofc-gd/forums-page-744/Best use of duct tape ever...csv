419056,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-06 02:40:00,10439,I have a bunch of friends that guide in Alaska and that is the reason they never leave the plane unatended. One friend had to stay with the plane once and was catching a few winks when he awaoke to the plane bouncing up and down. He looked out of the window to see a large black bear bouncing on one of the planes pontoons. A bear banger shot out of the window fixed the problem.
419100,danc,2010-01-06 04:01:00,4677,Happens here in the North of Ontario too. I know a guy that had his boat seats ripped apart by a bear. Thanks goodness our provincial government is doing their best to control the bear populations.
419118,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-06 04:43:00,10439, We don't use plastic gas cans in the boats at our fly out destinations 'cause the bears punch them full of holes.

419320,Billy Bob,2010-01-06 23:06:00,5865,I flew into a outpost in Gogama that would have been better if the cabin was made out of duct tape.....as a matter of fact the outhouse only had 3 walls and no door....even the bears wouldn't come around to this site...they knew better.

418765,danc,2010-01-05 03:51:00,4677,"Here's the story as I received it.    During a private ""fly-in"" fishing excursion in the Alaskan wilderness, the chartered pilot and fishermen left a cooler and bait in the plane. And a bear smelled it.. This is what he did to the plane.            The pilot used his radio and had another pilot bring him 2 new tires, 3 cases of duct tape, and a supply of sheet plastic. He patched the plane together, and FLEW IT HOME!       I heard that the pilots name was Wayne. Some dude from Ontario."
418775,purekgw,2010-01-05 04:30:00,585,how much duck tape they carry with them ?!?  woops didnt see part with other pilot

419005,Roy,2010-01-06 00:15:00,13728,"I think it might have been Gerritt who once said, probably when referring to children, "" Silence is golden, duct tape is silver."" I agree."
419014,tjsa,2010-01-06 00:35:00,1578,"I have seen that before but never posted it.  One day years back, probably 1984ish, I was down in Oshkosh Wisconsin for the annual Experimental Aircraft  Association show with my dad and a good friend of his. Tired of the tent breakfasts after 4 days, we took the shuttle to the terminal lounge. While eating breakfast, we noticed an F-14/16??(could have the model wrong now) parked outside. We finished breakfast and walked out to it to look it over while waiting for the shuttle to return. We gave it a good look over. I climbed up to the cockpit and there was a roll of duct tape on the dashboard. Shortly after that, the air force pilot came along, we introduced ourselves and said we hope you didn't mind us taking a closer look at your ride. He was all smiles and said, no problem, can I answer any questions? Immediately I asked him what the duct tape was for, and he replied, ""everything, when I inspect my aircraft after landing, and find a small issue, I just tape it up, so that it does not become a larger issue until I can get it properly serviced"". We laughed about that. Unfortunately no pictures, I left my SLR locked up in the truck by our tent    :wallbash:  We sure could not have done that in today's world now."
419015,danc,2010-01-06 00:40:00,4677,  That's how we fix our F-150's and F-250's as well Tom. Duct tape.
