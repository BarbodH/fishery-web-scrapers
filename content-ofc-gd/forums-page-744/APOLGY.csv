I talked to Jos this morning and he said not to worry he will look after me. I was asking a question in general as i had never heard of the shop before and contacted him after being refered to him by some board members here, some took acception to the queary, it was a simple error and aparently bad judgment on my part to ask. It has been looked after, all is good thanks for your help."

418731,Twocoda,2010-01-05 02:08:00,4130,seems only fitting with all the apologies going on around here...   
419233,asdve23rveavwa,2010-01-06 19:26:00,2690,"Not sure what happened here, but, good for you.  Jos has always been a ""class act"" and a pleasure to deal with...my trips to Bass Pro have become pretty much non-existent."
419235,motion,2010-01-06 19:32:00,403,"Hey walleyejack, thats classy of you to publicly apologize.   Jos is a great guy and is always helpful. I drove the 1.5 hrs out to Woodstock last week with my son and came back with a ton of ice fishing gear. As always, Jos took the time to explain how to properly use the gear."
