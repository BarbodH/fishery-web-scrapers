418863,Mako,2010-01-05 17:28:00,25,"Date: Jan. 4th 2010 Location: Belleville Area Time: 1:30-3:30 Ice Thickness: 10 inches  So I finally had some time to get out on the ice, well sorta of I only had two hours, but its better than nothing.  Headed out to a spot that we had good luck with last season when going for perch...got to love GPSs.  I was on my own, so dragging the 2 man Frabill was a bit of a cardo workout.  I didn't have time to get minnows so I just used some Gulp with a jigging rap and some more on a swedish pimple. First fish was a dink then 10 mins later I had on a jumbo which I lost at the hole. I had some more taps then nothing for another 10mins when I landed the first jumbo which was 11 inches.  The school must of been passing my hole every 10 mins becuase it would go off like clockwork.  I'm glad I had the strike indicator on becuase even the big ones where just making it move slightly.  In the end I landed about 20 fish in 2 hours with 7 being in the 11inch range, all were released, not bad for mid day and no minnows on the BOQ.  The next outing will be a all day event and some of those tasty buggers will be coming home  Sitting on 10 inches   One of many 11 inch Jumbos   Strike Indicator   Lures of the day   The Setup   Cheers, aRon  "

418865,Joeytier,2010-01-05 17:37:00,3990,I use that exact colour swedish pimple for the perch on BOQ.  Nice going.
418868,johnnyb,2010-01-05 17:41:00,3413,Great report Ron...thanks for sharing what works for you
418874,Fang,2010-01-05 17:56:00,1330,"I just installed a few indicators on my perch rods. Fastened them using a 3-4"" piece of heak shrink tube from CTC. Just make sure you get the proper size to get over the end guide. In fact CTC sells a 2 pack of bite indicators with different colored ends so had to pick up a couple more as back up. The 2 pack comes with 2 - 1"" pieces of shrink tube I think you need more to get a good join."
419177,Mako,2010-01-06 15:06:00,25,"Thanks.  I picked up the strike indicators at Fishing Depot in Toronto about 2 years ago.  The black pieces are just rubber blocks with a slit in them, they install in snap and really help with the light bite. Normally your looking for the rod tip to be pulled down but with this your looking for he bead to go up.  The shrink tube ones sound interesting.  aRon   "

419559,limeyangler,2010-01-07 13:55:00,5204,"Great report, weird how fish are so predictable, even weirder is how predictable it is that they stop being predictable....lol."
