415964,Anderson,2009-12-28 13:29:00,32,"So for everyone that was wondering These Brookies are between 5 and 7 years old that were hatchery fish released to live out the rest of their days They put 700 of them in last May The lake also holds good numbers of splake which average 1-3 years and average 12-14 in we usually let them go unless badly hooked The lake also hold a good population of walleyes with the biggest I""ve seen so far around 8lbs but lots o0f little ones in the 1lb range Rumor has it the lake use to have lakers and the deepest spot is 82 ft so their could be a monster still swimming and eating those little splake "
415969,Curtis,2009-12-28 13:50:00,83,Ice fishing brookies is my fav. There is something about fishing 3-5ft of water with your head down the hole watchin a brookie circle your bait. Dosen't get any better.. Are there any natural brookie lakes left? Other than nipigon ect.. Where i fish up in haliburton im pretty sure everything is put and take no naturals.
415973,Anderson,2009-12-28 14:00:00,32,"Yes we do have natural brookie lakes I was with 2 friends in a Noname lake , buddie caught a 9 lb""er as soon as it came to the surface I said to my friend hey that's a nice lake trout he said to me There are no lake trout in here( Jaw drop ) I heard rumors of an 11 Lb""er comming outta the same lake It""s about an hour from here There are other natural lake  and are usually canoe and over niters"
415976,solopaddler,2009-12-28 14:11:00,8605,"Some nice fish there, thanks for posting!"
415991,asdve23rveavwa,2009-12-28 15:10:00,2690,"""Gotta"" love those Nipigon brookies...beautiful fish!"
415997,limeyangler,2009-12-28 15:35:00,5204,I said it 2wice already....PHAT PHANTASTIC PHISH Rock....good job.
416133,Meegs,2009-12-28 22:05:00,249,Oh man does that ever get my blood boiling for specks!    Great job man..    those are TOP NOTCH specks ANYWHERE!
416162,Spiel,2009-12-28 23:26:00,9065,Oh I love brookies and those are some serious BROOKIES!
416272,troutboy,2009-12-29 03:17:00,125,"Nice brookies! I love catching 7 pounders thru the ice, its just magical to see the brookie to   hit your jig ,im going out tomorrow to get some brookies,they dont have a chance!"
416315,danc,2009-12-29 05:31:00,4677,"  Don't blame you. I wouldn't eat one either. Those old hatchery brood stock are pretty much useless. We get them dumped in one of our local lakes too. I don't know what the guys that catch them do with them here. Your photos are typical of fish that have lived in concrete tanks for their entire lives. The worn out tails and fat bodies are telltale signs. Does the lakes name start with an ""L""?"
416361,Anderson,2009-12-29 13:34:00,32,"Good eye on that one It""s pretty tough to get a good looking brood stock and yes the lake starts with L One year we fished a lake that starts with S where they had put in some brood lakers averaging 15 lbs We did a couple on the smoker and they were not bad proving the point that a good cook can make a boot taste great"
