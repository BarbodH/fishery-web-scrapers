419038,Rob,2010-01-06 02:01:00,467,Well under some good advice from fellow OFC members(once again! ) I purchased my Salus floater suit from Rack and Reel in Barrie. Very good price at $350 bucks very friendly people there and quick on the ordering (2 days) Anyways thanks everyone for the advice and see you on the ice!!  Rob C
419039,BillM,2010-01-06 02:02:00,17367,"Rob, did they have anything for you to try on for size?  I need a floater in the very near future and they are just down the street.  Also, which model Salus do they carry?"
419040,Rob,2010-01-06 02:07:00,467,They just got a shipment of them today and had at least three of them on the rack. I am not sure of the size but check Here and you will see the sizing chart for the suits.     Rob C
419043,BillM,2010-01-06 02:18:00,17367,"Thanks bud, I'll take a run over there tomorrow and take a look."
419117,discophish,2010-01-06 04:42:00,392,I'm thinking of filling the bathtub up with cold water and ice cubes and hopping in with mine seeing that I haven't been able to get on the ice yet.  The quality of the suit is outstanding compared to my old suit.  Fish safe and have fun
419131,wormdunker,2010-01-06 05:49:00,1711,"I have a buoy o buoy.  I find it is bulky & rather uncomfortable to move around in.  It is definitely very warm.  Are the salus suits warm, how are they for comfortable movement?"
419176,NAW,2010-01-06 15:00:00,4022,"I was in the Rack and Reel yesterday.  They had a large, and XL and a XXL to try on.  The model they carry is the Pro-Lite series (cheapest model).  They are on sale until the end of the week.  $350, down from $400.  They can order anything Salus..  They have the endurance class model on sale for $450.  I bought the Endurance (not from Rack and Reel).  The price is great considering you can order it from Cabalas for $430, plus shipping.  My Endurance will be here tomorrow.  I can't wait!!"
419192,Thrasher,2010-01-06 15:37:00,39,"For those in the market, a few years ago, I bought the Helly Hanson Alpha suit. Great suit, great features (zippers, pockets, suspenders, adjustable neoprene inner cuffs etc.) I paid $280 +/-. It was one of least expensive suits around, and had more features than most $100-$200 more! I've used it a ton, it's warm, breaks in rather quick and haven't had an issue with it. FYI, jt"
419193,Thrasher,2010-01-06 15:38:00,39,"Forgot to mention, the ONLY down fall I've found, is the hood isn't insulated."
419197,motion,2010-01-06 15:45:00,403,"Thrasher, I have the same Helly Hanson Alpha suit and love the suit for the warmth and all the pockets but I find it a tad bulky and heavy. My son has the Mustang and its much lighter and less bulky. Might just be me getting old.LOL"
419223,NAW,2010-01-06 18:37:00,4022,"NICE!!!!! My floater suit just arrived.  A day early.  I gave them a CC# yesterday, and it arrived today.  Can't beat that..  This thing looks bad ass.  Can't wait for this weekend."
