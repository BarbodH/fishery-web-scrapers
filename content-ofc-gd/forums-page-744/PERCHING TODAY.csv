Going out probally again tomorrow and thursday, maybe friday if anyone wants to join  Dave ["
419001,crappieperchhunter,2010-01-06 00:03:00,2582,Good going. Nothing better then a feed of perch. Just curious though... what size are you calling keepers? Some people its anything over 7 inches others anything over 10. And others it's somewhere in between.
419002,DMASSE,2010-01-06 00:06:00,420,WE KEEP ANYTHING THAT 3-4 INCHES  J/K  Our keepers are all 10-14inches..  most 11-12   1 Inch gulp alive minnows were the ticket today   Dave
419011,crappieperchhunter,2010-01-06 00:29:00,2582,Beauty fish. I call keepers anything over 10 as well. But sometimes go a little smaller through the ice if that is what it takes to get a feed.
419012,jaydub,2010-01-06 00:34:00,145,"Wow, hope the bite is still on this weekend, I'm hoping to get out and get some dinner and I'd even settle for 9""ers!"
419018,RickOnt,2010-01-06 00:43:00,669,Hey Dave  Nice catch!!!  I like 9-11 for Keepers Under 9 and Over 11 Go Back!!    You said you were off Innisfil Rd would that be the 8th which is Innisfil Beach Park or  were you at Gilford Rd or Hwy #89??????    I did not think there was fishable ice at the Innisfil Rd!!!!     Rick
419019,Roy,2010-01-06 00:44:00,13728,Congrats. Did you manage any pics?
419025,irishfield,2010-01-06 00:59:00,26272,Did they charge you to park Dave ??
419045,DMASSE,2010-01-06 02:22:00,420,Rickont  was 89/ gilford rd.  Parked by the hut rental place  going again in the next couple days if anyone wants to come
419047,RickOnt,2010-01-06 02:37:00,669,I am Planning to go on Thurs.   Good Luck  Rick
419142,Woodsman,2010-01-06 10:28:00,1286,DMASSE maybe you should correct the title and your first post to reflect it was not Innisfil Beach Road. We don't want someone going out off Innisfil because they did not read the whole thread and believed it is safe.  Rick
419144,Chuck Best,2010-01-06 11:11:00,308,"Nobody is fishing off Innisfil Beach,I go to the park every morning now and nobody has been out here yet.....I'll take my gear with me on Friday to see if anyone else will lead the way,cause I'm second in line to go first ,but first in line to go second....lol...but it SHOULD be good to go on Saturday if the temps hold....TC and tight lines all....Chuck..."
419188,johnnyb,2010-01-06 15:34:00,3413," So far, I'm lookin' at Friday...will drop you a line if plans hold together.   D'oh!!!  You SURE you don't wanna go Friday too?  Would be great to fish with you again"
419218,LeXXington,2010-01-06 17:39:00,1928,Yummy Perch
419240,ScugogBoy,2010-01-06 19:50:00,36,"I went today and had a blast...Scugog has been slow so we decided to head over to Cooks Bay and give it a shot. For us it was non stop action using minnows and a jig or swedish pimple. I kept 32 over 9"" and my freind kept his 25 (conservation licence)....we were only in 9 feet of water over a weed bed, but the bite was on...did not have to move or drill any other holes. I have a couple of pics...you guys want to see them?..or have you seen enough pics of the standard guys on ice in front of their catch?"
419292,Woodsman,2010-01-06 22:26:00,1286,"Chuck your a braver man than me. My past experiences have been the first guy out is the fool who believes 1 1/2"" - 2"" is safe ice. BTW; I hope to meet up with you again this year on the ice as in past years.  Best Wishes & Be Safe: Rick"
