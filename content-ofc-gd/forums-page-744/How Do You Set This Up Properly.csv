I'm can care less about the brand but as a example I am using the Trokar Flipping Barbed hook.  To me it looks like a simple hook with a plastic keeper, but being a ""flipping"" hook how do you set this up with a soft plastic and a weight. It doesn't look like a hook that you would texas rig with but I may be wrong.  Looking for a solid reply about these type baits, I have made it my goal to learn how to use flipping and pitching jigs in both thick and thin cover for largemouth next season, but this topic interests me a lot.  Thanks for help! MTBF"
418927,BIG FISH,2010-01-05 21:32:00,54,check out this video i usually fish them with a soft plastic like a mudbug or flippin chunk  rigged on the hook

419022,pikeie,2010-01-06 00:53:00,380,I have used that style of hook without the plastic keeper for a while. Infact the ones I use have a big barb near the eye insted. I find with these hooks u can get a hook into the roof of the mouth of a big largie much eaiser and makes them harder to loose. It has something todo with the direction of pull.
419150,singingdog,2010-01-06 12:12:00,1047," Yep, you still T-rig with hooks like that. The advantage, over the more typical offset hook is that the hook moves more easily through the plastic that you are using, resulting in a better hookset. The downside is that there is no ""kink"" to keep the bait in place....that's what the plastic keeper is for. If you read some of Gary Yamamotos articles from the past, he almost always uses a straight-shank hook over an offset hook for rigging worms and senkos.  IMHO, you can achieve the same results by using a light-wire offset hook."
419152,azebra,2010-01-06 12:40:00,168,"someone point me in the right direction. i know how to throw out a lure, and reel it in.. what is flipping? and pitching, all that bass lingo gets to me sometimes...flippin jig? FLIP!!"
419154,Roy,2010-01-06 12:48:00,13728," Hey Bud, don't worry about it. This is all jock talk...it all means fishing. For some people, turning your wrist 16 degrees to the right with a craw patterned bait is another style of fishing completely. You'll get used to it....it really is not important."
419162,Harrison,2010-01-06 13:23:00,2202,"Flipping, is basically using a set amount of line without using the bail between underhand flips/casts of the lure. Pitching, is an underhand style cast(using the bail) to specific targets.  Both used for close range, especially flipping.  As for the straight shank vrs offset flippin hooks, I use the off set.  Prefer a better bait profile and can't say I have missed fish becasue of the offset.  For wider body baits texas riggin or tex-posing I like the riggin hook from owner."
419163,lew,2010-01-06 13:24:00,12766," Actually Roy, I think you'll find 17 degrees works better"
419164,Harrison,2010-01-06 13:32:00,2202," Depends on the wind lol, 2.3mm of splash on lure entry is most important.  Any more or less splash, your wasting your time."
419531,singingdog,2010-01-07 11:37:00,1047," They are both techniques used by bass fisherman to put a lure into cover with maximum accuracy and minimum splash. They are very specialised techniques, and are quite difficult to do if you aren't standing high on the deck of a bass boat: nearly impossible sitting down. Do a Google search and be prepared to read for a couple of hours."
