That night after the festivities were finally over, she & Charles had retired back to their room.  Camilla flopped on the bed and said ""Please remove my shoes darling. Ones feet are killing me.""  Ever obedient, the Prince of Wales attacked her right shoe with vigor . . . .. But it would not budge.  ""Harder"" yelled Camilla.  ""Harder"" Charles yelled back, ""I'm trying darling! But it's just so bloody tight!""  ""Come on give it all you've got"" she cried.  Finally when it released, Charles let out a big groan, and Camilla exclaimed ""There! Oh God, that feels so good.""  In the bedroom next door The Queen turned to Prince Phillip and said ""See I told you she was still a virgin with a face like that!""  Meanwhile back in the other bedroom Charles was attempting to remove the other shoe when he cried out ""Oh god, darling this ones even tighter""  At which point Prince Phillip turned and said to the Queen ""That's my boy, Once a Navy man, always a navy man!"""
