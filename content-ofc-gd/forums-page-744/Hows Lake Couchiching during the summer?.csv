418728,fishdawg,2010-01-05 01:53:00,912,"Ok so my wifes parents, sis & bro-in-law & us all want to rent a cottage this season for a week. Im looking at the second week of Sept.  So far the places that i want to go to are ""to far to drive"" apparently (Nippissing, Quinte, Haliburton, ect) Not interested in the Kawarthas at all, have had a place there  for many years & want to see new waters.  Im wondering about Couch. I know its a busy lake in the summer, I figure it should be relatively calm & quiet in Mid-Sept?  Its not a 100% fishing trip (as ive been told lol) but i obviously would be sneaking out for some daily ""freetime""....  I have allready found some reasonable looking rentals so far....  my boat is only a 16 footer, is the lake prone to ""blowing up"" regularly?  not looking for anyones honey holes either...  any ideas/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.... thanks!"
418730,ohhenrygsr,2010-01-05 02:00:00,947,hey FishDawg You will love Couch and what it has to offer.  The locals and residents on the shoreline are very friendly and Orillia has lots to offer downtown.  i honstly believe Orillia Water Front is far nicer then Barrie but that's my personal opinion.  As far as the lake blowing up it will in a matter of 1/2 hr or so there will be white caps.  If you have a deeper V-hull then you should be fine.  Are you thinking of renting the north end of Couch?

418807,motion,2010-01-05 13:47:00,403,We have a place on Couch and love fishing it all summer/fall. Some of the best fishing is in September. Get yourself a good map to avoid shoals.   Great smallie action to be had all around the lake.
418954,fishdawg,2010-01-05 22:29:00,912,thanks folks... appreciate the advice? Happy to hear there are plenty of smallies to be had? Many pike around the weeds too?
418986,steverowbotham,2010-01-05 23:31:00,1800,"Lots of bass and pike to be had, in mid Sept, fish a little deeper if you're looking for pike.  Weeds in 15-20 feet.  The water is gin-clear"

If yer there for the week,take a trip up the canel and fish Sparrow aswell.  Like mentioned,get yerself a good map.Dont be zippen around,unless you know the lake."
419010,fishdawg,2010-01-06 00:26:00,912,just checked... I do have Couch on my GPS map chip as well as paper charts
