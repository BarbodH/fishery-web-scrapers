418976,troutboy,2010-01-05 23:16:00,125,"Check out this video I found,its a whole bunch of people salmon fishing off a bridge of some sort in washington!  "
418982,HTHM,2010-01-05 23:25:00,4082,t-minus 59:42 till lockdown...
418984,steverowbotham,2010-01-05 23:28:00,1800,"every one of those ""anglers"" should be ashamed, good on grandpa bringing the kids down to enjoy the wonderful fishery"
418987,richyb,2010-01-05 23:37:00,774,That reminds me of the lindsay locks catching carp. Thats not any differant than any of the steelhead rivers. I hate crowds i would turn around and go somewhere else.
418990,trout-eater,2010-01-05 23:41:00,21,that's horrible.  worse then the tribs in Ontario.
418991,troutboy,2010-01-05 23:42:00,125,"I was asking myself how those salmon can keep coming back year after year to attept not to get snagged by literly hundreds of hooks,good thing up north here there are tons of salmon and trout rivers that spred the crowds of only 60 people at the most!"
418995,irishfield,2010-01-05 23:42:00,26272,Great participation though... Everyone gets out of the way when a fish is on.. try that on Bronte...
419000,BillM,2010-01-06 00:02:00,17367,Reminds me of the dirty Burt!!!!
419067,Burtess,2010-01-06 03:07:00,901," Hey, I'm not dirty!!!!  Burt"
419082,redneck666,2010-01-06 03:22:00,563,wrong word!!!! thats wayyy to many people for me....... i'd get mad if all those people were in my way!
419088,blarg,2010-01-06 03:32:00,289,i wonder how many get hit in the face with a lure on a daily basis
419172,anders,2010-01-06 14:29:00,1168,Might as well throw a giant gill net leave it for an afternoon and have the people come by and pick up there fish....quite upsetting
419173,dobee,2010-01-06 14:31:00,301, lol
419179,Meegs,2010-01-06 15:09:00,249,"lol    no way, definatley the dam at the Oak!~"
419191,BillM,2010-01-06 15:36:00,17367, I'd take Oak over Burt anyday..  At least I can escape downstream  Burt definitely brings out some interesting folk!
419228,asdve23rveavwa,2010-01-06 19:06:00,2690,"Wow, and I thought the Beaver River at Thornbury was ridiculous!"
419234,craigdritchie,2010-01-06 19:28:00,1586,"Still nowhere near as bad as Bronte.  Compared to PetroCan Park, the spot in the video looks like it has way more room to fish. Plus there's no garbage or coils of old fishing line lying around, and no half-rotten, maggot-encrusted, sliced-open chinnies to step over. Looks like the guys in the video take their salmon home to eat, so they at least value them on some level -- unlike the goons at Bronte who just slice them open and leave them flopping on the bank to rot. And as irishfield notes, everyone seems to get along and try to stay out of one another's way. Definitely not like Bronte at all.  Bronte has to be the biggest toilet on the planet. Even the Dirty Burt has more going for it."
419239,asdve23rveavwa,2010-01-06 19:48:00,2690,After reading the comments to this topic...I know why I stay away from Bronte and all the other crowded spots when it comes to my Steelheading or occasional pier fishing for salmon.  I would rather catch 1/4 of the fish and actually enjoy the experience.  When it gets to where you have to wait for someone else to reel in before you can begin your drift it becomes less pleasurable...it isn't all about numbers of fish.  Guess I'm just getting old!!!!!!
419274,FISHINGNUT,2010-01-06 21:22:00,253,They must have been snagged because I didnt see one marshmellow and every one knows you need marshmellows to catch salmon
419484,ch312,2010-01-07 04:05:00,1590," fixed for ya   a google search of ""dirty burt"" turned up quite the definition in the urban dictionary. not for kids..."
