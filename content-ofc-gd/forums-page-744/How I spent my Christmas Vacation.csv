Plus, you sorta gotta be around family through the holidays so I spent time in the shop along with visiting and such.    we have...jewelry boxes. From a plan I found in a magazine while Christmas shopping. If you're gonna do the tool setup, may as well make it worth while.       "

419020,Twocoda,2010-01-06 00:49:00,4130,Kinda has a Dr Seuss appeal to them...and im starting to feel like a rerun Excellent job Dara ...these for sale too?
419042,Dara,2010-01-06 02:13:00,3052,Never thought of that george. I always told my wife that i thought some of them fancy salmon lures would make good earings. They would prolly look good in that box too....maybe a pair of hammered gold sweedish pimples with red blades on em.  yes twocoda...for sale...I need snowmobile gas money
