419089,Dara,2010-01-06 03:36:00,3052,They are catching whitefish in leighs bay. I wouldn't think Haviland is ready yet but I really don't know...it has been pretty cold and no snow so maybe.  wormdangler should know
419095,redneck666,2010-01-06 03:47:00,563," thanks for the help! do you happen to know how thick the ice is out on leigh's bay right now? and i already asked wormdangler, he says he hasnt heard anything about it. he did tell me that he only managed to get one perch today! lol"
419101,Dara,2010-01-06 04:02:00,3052,"There are huts out there..must be enough...just stick to other people trails,"

419291,archie_james_c,2010-01-06 22:24:00,618,  You got a camp on Ranger SSMFishguy? Our family has one on the last subdivision before top park...
419297,foggynotions,2010-01-06 22:32:00,21," My really good friend has a camp up there pretty much right at KM 54, you turn down the road with the pink panther or you can go in from Collins Road.  Technically you can call it the 2nd subdivision of the 3 that are there."
419300,archie_james_c,2010-01-06 22:39:00,618,"  Awesome, whos that? We're the Archibalds by the way"
419302,foggynotions,2010-01-06 22:41:00,21," I go to the Farrell's camp, my buddy Nate is related to them (its his aunts camp) but we use it all the time all year long.  Archibald's sounds familiar sure I have seen the sign on the subdivision road."
419306,archie_james_c,2010-01-06 22:45:00,618,  You're right beside us hahah   . Are you Buczel?
419309,foggynotions,2010-01-06 22:51:00,21, Which Farrell are you thinking?? i think you are in the other subdivision.. cause the two people beside him are not Archibald's.  Are you guys down by where the pig roast happens every August.
419311,archie_james_c,2010-01-06 22:52:00,618,  There must be two Farrels on the lake   . We are definitely the next road over
419316,pike slayer,2010-01-06 22:58:00,1177,isnt that a buczel holding that big pike with tdunn in the other topic??
419318,archie_james_c,2010-01-06 23:00:00,618,"  Dont know, I dont know junior only the old timer"
