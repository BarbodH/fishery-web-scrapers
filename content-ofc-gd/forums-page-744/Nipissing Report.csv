First off I want to say that if you are driving out on the lake be VERY careful.  There have been several incidents with vehicles going through the ice!  I have my shack set up on the southshore between Deepwater point and Lonely island right on a break that goes from 32' up to 20'.  The perch action has been non stop, we are catching them on everything(spoons, jigs, etc..)  The walleye seem to be favouring a spoon tipped with a minnow.  All were caught between 3:30 to 5pm.  I'll try and get some pictures on our next outing."

Bringing my shack up tonight, and will finally get out for the first time Sat morning. I put my shack on Callander bay. I'll post Monday with results. Thrasher"

419773,sneak_e_pete,2010-01-08 00:52:00,540,"Thanks for the report.  Had a similar experience.  Was on the south shore from the 3rd to the 6th.  Tons of perch as well, lots of jumbos.  No walleye the first 2 days, moved to a different hut the 3rd night and got 3 between 4pm and 5pm.  Rapala jig and jig and minnow were the tickets for me.....didn't try spoons."
