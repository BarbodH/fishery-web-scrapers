418895,Jen,2010-01-05 19:18:00,833,"We do not often get away, but this year we both needed a break so Steve booked us a little cabin at Windemere Resort just outside of Haliburton Forest.    We went for two nights... Snowmobiling and fishing, a very relaxing way to unwind.          The trails were awesome with some of the most beautiful sceanery I have ever had a chance to enjoy...  There were many lakes to choose from, so we picked Black Lake... close to the tea stained open water ,yet still 6 -8 inches of good ice.      Steve managed to find a drop off from 3 feet of water to 32 feet of water, we dropped our lines in at 9"".      It wasn't a long wait before we were catching fish...         Slippery fish to say the least!   Buckshots seem to work everywhere, however I caught first fish on just a minnow head and Steve caught his on a minnow... so we were never sure what the fish were preferring as we quit tied 2 to 2 , going 4 for 8.  We met some great people, Steve and Terry, and had some fun times...  Thanks so much to Steve for taking me away! Even when my sled broke down twice and he had to tow me 10 miles he managed to stay calm and patient!  Not only was it the best way I have ever rung in a New Year it was a great way to let go of 2009!!  Cheers,  Jen ( bernadette )"

418969,turtle,2010-01-05 23:03:00,274,"I spent new year's weekend up there as well, I am fortunate to have a cottage that backs on to the Haliburton Forest. I caught one small laker Friday afternoon and got skunked on Saturday in the one hour at -30C windchill without a shelter.  Wish I was up there now."
