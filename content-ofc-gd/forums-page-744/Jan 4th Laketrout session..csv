So....got a window of opportunity yesterday afternoon.....and i can get to the trout lake by sled right from our house....I'M OUTTA HERE!  Set up pretty much where i fished last year....65 FOW, various spoons, tube jigs, plain jigs used.....live baits from small to large minnows and some 6"" sucker minnows used too....just playing with different styles and presentations....got hits on all the different combinations....fish were not fussy.  Tons of smelt on the screen all day....really cool watching a dark orange signal move through the darker blue clouds of bait fish.....come right through and smack my jig just above the bait fish mark....AWESOME.   Here's my vid for the couple hours i spent out, missed a few, released a few....kept 2....not much better than that except landing one over 10lbs which i still have not accomplished on the ice or in the boat....maybe this year.    NEW YEARS RESOLUTION, WATCHING MY LANGUAGE ON VIDEOS....A COUPLE OF SLIP UPS...HALF BLEEPED  "

Trout not open where you are?   We did that last year , was fun. We are gonna try again this year. But if ya wanna get out sometime without the crowd too im up for that as well. There are a couple of other ""tobans"" i know from the iceshanty.com website....they plan to hook up with us this year too....might be Feb on Shoal Lake for whities.     Happy new year to you too Jacques......i'm cooking the trout under the grill at this very moment.    there's that scarily big word again.....    Cheers Corvette."
