418625,vinnimon,2010-01-04 21:43:00,2593,"Im in for the 20th,Ill ask a few other members to go."
418682,misfish,2010-01-05 00:14:00,29133,"If anyone else wants to step up and help out with anything,please feel free. I dont have the time to make it a full blown shindig like Mo put on.        Terry,can you edit your title bud.  It is the 20th and will be at Innisifil."

415972,Terry,2009-12-28 13:52:00,14456,so it is the 20th at Innisfil
415977,ccmtcanada,2009-12-28 14:11:00,7971,I picked the 13th...it's the License free weekend...a great chance for everyone to get out there!  http://www.familyfishingweekend.com/Winter.cfm
415982,bigugli,2009-12-28 14:22:00,6138,"The big problem with the Family weekend is the number of public events and derbies held that weekend. There are derbies in the Kawarthas and Simcoe, and the Fishing Show in Toronto, just for starters."
415983,ChrisK,2009-12-28 14:24:00,2772,I picked the 20th. I may be able to talk someone into making it by then if we push it out that far

416069,Toronto_Angler,2009-12-28 18:48:00,698,I'm in for the 20th. I'd really like to meet everyone on this board and since I don't have a boat  and this is close to toronto it would be a great opportunity for me to meet everyone without begging to come on their boat lol
416109,kickingfrog,2009-12-28 21:11:00,8333,"If it matters, the Olympics are from Feb 12-28."
416117,richyb,2009-12-28 21:27:00,774,What area of the lake ?
416129,Terry,2009-12-28 21:49:00,14456,I believe they settled on Innisfil area that way the walkers can walk and still get whitefish and lake trout and perch too
416163,MuskyBill,2009-12-28 23:31:00,311,"I'll be at the ACC bangin' my head the night before, but the 20th is still the best weekend for me."

416313,joonmoon,2009-12-29 05:23:00,528,"I picked the 20th, lots of good ice by then and no tourneys or other gatherings booked. Hopefully this works for more people. Maybe see ya out there."
416377,fishhunter,2009-12-29 14:23:00,604,SO FAR 20TH SOUNDS GOOD FOR ME
416381,misfish,2009-12-29 14:41:00,29133,"I picked other,just so ya know.  Oh the date,,,,,,,,,,     June 26th."
416397,Terry,2009-12-29 15:10:00,14456,"misfish  if I see you walk out to the whitefish grounds on that date, I will follow"
416409,irishfield,2009-12-29 15:27:00,26272,"  Well you have fun out there.. Terry, know anyone that would want his spot ??"
416415,Terry,2009-12-29 15:37:00,14456,"LOL yeah, I PMed him earlier too"
416535,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-12-29 23:00:00,1362,  Hey Wayne....looks like we're gonna miss bumping into you guys by a week   ....we're headin' up Feb 25th - Mar 2nd
416651,Greencoachdog,2009-12-30 02:15:00,8163, What's a Whitefish???
416947,Fisherman,2009-12-31 00:01:00,7201,"Well I guess the moniker under your Avatar isn't worth a pinch of possum poop, an ""Imperial Angler"" and can't google whitefish...   Whitefish,  looks like a silvery carp with a sort of sucker mouth, hoever the meat is more white, great deep fried or smoked."
416952,Fisherman,2009-12-31 00:08:00,7201,"Now the only issue with Innisfil, they have passed the $10 parking fee at Innisfil Beach Park, no idea how and when they are going to start to collect it.  So, something to think about for the future when picking a place to hold a charity type event, I don't know if there's a way to circumvent this issue.  I know from the last couple of years at the tyler event, we had a lot of folks use that parking lot and this might turn a number of people off the event. Just my politely written thoughts, 'cause you can imagine the plethora of explitives I was forced to withhold."
