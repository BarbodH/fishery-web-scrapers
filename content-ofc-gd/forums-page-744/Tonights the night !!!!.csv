419094,bigugli,2010-01-06 03:47:00,6138,"It was Canada's game to lose and Team USA had everything to gain. That was one heck of a game. Just think, the series is being played closer to home, next year , in Buffalo."
419097,Twocoda,2010-01-06 03:57:00,4130,no shame in losing a game like that ...the yanks wanted it more....
419098,vinnimon,2010-01-06 03:57:00,2593,
419099,Cookslav,2010-01-06 04:00:00,1457,"Kudos to ther U.S Boys... They won fair and square. Some poor officiating in the 1st period but more then that I think Allen is going to be haunted for years to come for a couple of weak ones.  Story of the game was the US defence though...man what a performance.  IMO This may have been the classiest, most deserving American Crew though. Can't fault them...clean play for the most part and a good game watch for them next year!  But Basil, Rob, and Ray...you should have a word with your sons about loyalty and treason ya jerks(J/K) "
419102,uglyfish,2010-01-06 04:08:00,981,"im horribly embarrassed. they kicked our asses. we didnt play our game and lost to the yanks... what a terrible way to start a new year off.   now, on to my rant  lol  1) worst officiating in a tourney i have EVER seen. just brutal. 2) taylor hall is NOT a number 1 draft pick. FLOATER comes to mind, as does NO DEFENSIVE PRESENCE. 3) the Suiss goalie was one of the best i have EVER seen. 4) pietriangleo was NOT defenseman of the tourney. 5) EBERLE WAS TOURNEY MVP   i could say more, but ill leave it at that. i live for this tourney, best hockey to watcdh all year long... but, i hate losing... especially to the americans!"
419105,Twocoda,2010-01-06 04:17:00,4130, we let them win so they would come and play next year..
419114,danc,2010-01-06 04:36:00,4677,"My thoughts..   Congrats to the US team. Great skaters with unbelievable hockey skills.  I thought that every goal that the US scored should have been a save by the Canadian goalie. All six of them. The Canuck goalie either had position on a long shot, or gave up the puck on a bad play. Seriously. Each and every goal. Give him the benefit of the doubt on half on them and we'd still have won by two goals. I think that goal tending is our weak spot. Pressure, pressure, pressure by the Canadians, and one shot by the US and they score. I would have pulled what's his name after the second goal."
419130,uglyfish,2010-01-06 05:48:00,981,"i blame that stupid new chant... ""eh oh canada go"" stupid, it sounds stupid. we always did well with GO CANADA GO. why change it??? they messed with a winning system..."
419161,dobee,2010-01-06 13:18:00,301,what a game... what a goal in OT!  if you look at the replays he doesnt even look at the net the whole time he has the puck....hes got his eyes on his teamates on the 3 on 1.... no look goal in OT.   WOW!
419166,TJQ,2010-01-06 13:59:00,7806,"It was heartbreaking especially after the 2 goal comeback... but kudos to the US, they beat us fair and square in our own house.. but NEXT year in Buffalo!!  Its our turn!"
418929,Lunker777,2010-01-05 21:36:00,866,"Seeing as I missed the game new years eve... the only one I missed ofcourse.... I am pumped to see tonights action. Its going to be an EPIC battle and I am PUMPED !!!! A few coors lights, Pulled pork sandwhiches and good friends comin over to watch !!!! Goin to be a good night  Lets go Canada !!!!!!"
418936,dobee,2010-01-05 21:48:00,301,go team canada    worst cheer ever.
418938,Governator,2010-01-05 21:50:00,879,"Been wearing my Team Canada shirt all day, can't wait!   [begin Rant]  Also, Eh' O' Canada Go is a terrible terrible cheer!  Two reasons:  1) It sounds stupid.  Eh' is to end a sentence not begin and I wouldn't be caught ever saying it in public. 2) Realize Pepsi isn't even an Olympic Sponsor they are just trying to cash in on everyone here.  [End Rant]"
418940,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-05 21:54:00,0,"i will be playing ""pond hockey"" on my buds backyard rink, then watching the game at his place! i hope it's a scary close game that we win! cheers!"

418944,bigugli,2010-01-05 21:59:00,6138,"Beer, brats and some exciting Jr. hockey. I just love it."
418946,steelhead hunter,2010-01-05 22:04:00,152,I've been pumped for this game since sunday lets just get started allready   Canada is going to smoke the yanks
418952,GeorgeJ,2010-01-05 22:22:00,207,Bound to be exciting can't wait!
418953,GBW,2010-01-05 22:22:00,8460,what's with all this Coors talk!  get a CANADIAN beer for tonight.  (Yes Lab. Blue does count)  Don't worry about ur girlish figure tonight...  Let's go boys!  GO CANADA GO!
418959,Governator,2010-01-05 22:34:00,879,"  In all fairness, Molson owns Coors now I believe.  I got moosehead all ready to go!"
418961,Cookslav,2010-01-05 22:37:00,1457,"I'm hoping the boys learned something last time these guys met, and they start the game physically, and fast and never look back.  Expect the U.S. to come out doing the same.... They know they had us on the ropes by doing just that last time, and are kicking themselves for letting up and trying to ""hold"" the lead. We only got back into the game last time for 2 reasons... They were motivated and the U.S. made a fatal strategy error by letting up offensively to play the trap. They won't do that again.  That being said Canada is the Superior team on Paper, and thus far have shown it on the Ice as well, now do they have the nerves to finish? I hope so!  GO BOYS GO!"
418968,misfish,2010-01-05 22:57:00,29133,"Man the Swiss are in a deep hurt,but they are showing some real heart.3rd period come back? Maybe.  As for our boyz,it,s going to be a battle til the end.  Both want it.Lets hope we come out on top."
419029,Handlebarz,2010-01-06 01:09:00,3790,GO CANADA GO  The new years game was wicked I got a late run tomorrow and can sleep in until 6am so it can be a all nighter to bad for the shootout like grapes sais Sudden Death 
419036,Cookslav,2010-01-06 01:50:00,1457,what the hell.... The Officiating is HORRIBLE.  2 & 10 for that hit....the guy turned away. How bout the American Hit from Behind in the first 3 minutes of the game RIGHT in front of the Ref? How bout the 2 step charge against Canada? Bull you know what....
419037,BillM,2010-01-06 02:00:00,17367,"I don't think the refs have been that bad.  You can't go on the bo's from the crowd, lol.  The last call I don't think should have been a 2+10 though...  The refs have let them play...  That charging penalty was pretty bad though."
419048,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-06 02:39:00,10439,I think there have been a couple of marginal calls against our boys but it's been a heck of a game so far. Keep it up lads!!!!!!
419049,Cookslav,2010-01-06 02:39:00,1457,"There bad LOL... Nothing to do with the boo's dude....but thats Junior hockey I guess? Its more about 2 bad calls against the canadians, and about 3 that have been ""overlooked"" for the Americans.  2nd period was better though. I think the nerves have settled a bit on both side of the ice and the refs I might add.  Now we have a fresh start in the 3rd. Good entertaining game but I wonder about Allen.....2 kinda soft goals He's making me reeeeeely nervous."
419051,misfish,2010-01-06 02:40:00,29133,"Who has a coin,,,,,,,,,to flip????  Man those yanks sure are fast.  It,s any teams game.   He's making me reeeeeely nervous.  He,s not the only one.  Team game.Still seeing to much single player.Pass the puck and shoooooooottttttt"
419052,steelhead hunter,2010-01-06 02:41:00,152,I don't know what game your watching Bill but these Refs are pethetic
419057,steelhead hunter,2010-01-06 02:43:00,152,Ya I know and I thought the OHL refs were blind LOL
419053,misfish,2010-01-06 02:44:00,29133, Thats INTERNATIONAL HOCKEY for ya.
419060,Roy,2010-01-06 02:53:00,13728,Might be some unhappy Canuckians tomorrow eh?
419061,BillM,2010-01-06 02:54:00,17367,"Should have pulled the kid after the 3rd goal.   That last one was brutal...  The US is playing better, if Canada doesn't change their tune, they deserve to lose."
419062,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-06 02:54:00,10439,"DOH, I spoke too soon!!!!!!!  UPDATE, WOOHOO!!!!!!!  Holy comebacks Batman!!! Off to Overtime!!!!!"
