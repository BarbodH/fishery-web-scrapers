419250,blaque,2010-01-06 20:26:00,2419,"i like a guy who shows he can and has made mistakes......no reason to do so either, wasnt forced or even asked. Like it alot better than a guy who sweeps past mistakes under the rug like they are perfect thats for sure. I'd say this puts fishing 24/7 on the no B.S.'er list from here on out."
419251,Headhunter,2010-01-06 20:26:00,5703,"We all learn, we all make mistakes, the key is to apply the knowlege you garnered from the situation and apply it to your future endevours! Props to the OP for posting this knowing full well that something was gonna hit the fan as a result... I think that in posting this, someone else may well learn from your mistake so, one hail mary for the pike that gave up it's life in order to teach a nube, how to properly handle a fish. I believe a moment of silence is required, to honour the pike...to be referred to in the future and for all time as ""Mr. X-Esox"". HH"
419664,Fishing 24/7,2010-01-07 20:17:00,709,i knew some guys would not like it....  but after this one. HUNDREDS more where released ... im all C&R!  just wanted to show how i was stupid.... if oyu can aply this. i was new exited... and with 0 education about fishing.  ill say like the other.  If this pike saved 10 pikes life....... theres common sense.  4 years old. maybe you had a dad that teached you how to fish?!?!  i had to learn the hard way. by killing them first... with mishandling !  then comming on boards like this one and asking question . live and learn. 
419670,Dozer,2010-01-07 20:55:00,896,"No harm done to the fish I bet.  Every animals skull is designed to take a beating.  Look, good for you posting this.  I bet there are people who viewed this thread and learned something."
419676,redneck666,2010-01-07 21:23:00,563,"i've made my mistakes too man.... dont feel bad, a cat fish bit me one time (i dont have the greatest temper) and the first thing i could grab is what i killed it with... im not like that anymore though. i follow the limits and handle my fish properly and hopefully will never be wrapped up with lures by a pike ......  i'll add this too, them things can take quite the beating!!"
419685,Stoty,2010-01-07 21:56:00,2910," Yes, I did, but it wasn't the fishing that I commented about, it was the way the fish was handled. I can understand the whole live and learn thing, but not dropping a fish on the gravel head first, and ripping apart its jaw...seems to be just common sense to me? That shouldn't be something that you need to be taught. lol"
419701,redneck666,2010-01-07 22:44:00,563," hey man, people make mistakes. yea sure, the way fish are handled should be common sense. thats why there are videos all over the place that show you how to handle fish properly... and when fish flop like that it isnt easy to keep control..... i almost dropped a fish like that, but i caught it       this is a stupid thing to argue about anyway, it happened what..... 5-6 years ago? he has obviously learned ALOT more about angling since then. like me, i just got into fishing about 3 years ago and i have learned SO MUCH MORE than i already knew."
419707,MCTFisher9120,2010-01-07 23:15:00,3761," Agreed. End the discussion Scott, you won't win or make anybody think in your favor. Your opinion of the topic has been stated.  There's always 1 lol"
419739,redneck666,2010-01-08 00:01:00,563,"hey look, i finally got someone to agree with me on the forum  hahaha"
419755,MCTFisher9120,2010-01-08 00:19:00,3761,"  Many people agree with you and like the fact that a person of character like Fishing 24/7 posted a video like this is knowledgeable. He did the correct thing here and everybody here knows that life is about living and learning. Not judging those that have yet to know right from wrong in the fishing world or any other situation.  Let's let the 1 person dispute end, and let others appreciate this thread for what it teaches.  MTBF"
419762,purekgw,2010-01-08 00:35:00,585,"should he have been more careful when handling the pike yes, we all know that but u should have kept the fish in the end  i got nothing against him but people should be more careful"
419823,Stoty,2010-01-08 02:26:00,2910, Who's Scott??
419834,misfish,2010-01-08 02:42:00,29133,"Stoty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MR RANGER MAN.LOL   Fish as you all wish. No matter what you all do,there will be someone that will pick ya apart.God forbid.  See ya all in 3 months or so.  Im outta a here."
419840,irishfield,2010-01-08 02:53:00,26272,Man.. I'm glad nobody video'd that Laker I caught last week.. thrashing around and such while trying to get it unhooked and a picture taken. If you can't accept that crap happens while fishing.... join P3TA and dye your hair blonde. Silicon is optional...
419850,MCTFisher9120,2010-01-08 03:07:00,3761,"Lmao, O Scotter, I'm enjoying the PM's from you bud...Ah the OFC life"
419852,cowanjo,2010-01-08 03:13:00,249,"Caught a muskie this year, cowgirl jaw and just above right eye - ended up with blood everywhere dont ask - always try and release quickly. I was trying to stop the blood flow from said thumb that happened to be bitten notice said muskie now not swimming away. (read this as belly up)  five - ten minutes later said thumb bandagaed - my mate gary still cradling muskie - finally kicks and swims away. Happy to say caught this opening day! - in July caught muskie at same spot with scar just above right eye - weight and length very simlar (within 3 cm)  We are all learning this site is awesome because everyone tries to release. I think that my son will have a better fishery than we do. the only issue in canada is lack of catch and release muskie"
419864,danc,2010-01-08 03:34:00,4677,I think that we've all learned something form this thread. Time to contemplate just what we all have learned.
418351,Fishing 24/7,2010-01-03 23:58:00,709,"**** ADMINS DO NOT REMOVE THIS VIDEO PLEASE*****  When i started to fish i wasnt Educated in the Fishing Handling Section...  I dont care who you are.  we all made mistakes when angling.  its like anything and everything we have to learn by our mistakes.  Experimented anglers showed me ALOT and i leaned ALOT with time in a boat.  These are typical errors made by new anglers.  In this video i just seem to make them all at once!  dont hate me for this.  on the flip side learn , laugh, and enjoi this SICK video 5-6 years back i cant remmember when it was.  Me and stephanie had just started to fish.  "
418357,Greencoachdog,2010-01-04 00:07:00,8163,Oh yeah!... I am soooo hating you!!!  I bet you feel like a big man now that you killed that poor little Pike eh!!!
418359,walleye_man,2010-01-04 00:10:00,135,come on everyone make mistakes and kevin it was a mistake it happens have a good one
418367,Greencoachdog,2010-01-04 00:23:00,8163,"  Yah, I know... I was just razzing him so I could see him sweat for a few minutes (Stephanie promised me she would take pics).  I hope you got you pliers now to unhook the fish with Kevin boy?  I think you should change your handle to ""Pike Mangler""!!!"
418384,MCTFisher9120,2010-01-04 01:13:00,3761,"Hmm, I think everybody in their live has had a fish fall off of a scale. Believe me, when I see ""pro anglers"" swing bass into the boat all that slime comes off when they roll around on the carpet...came when a bass shakes off the hook and falls onto the floor of my boat...little guys mostly but crap happens, all we can do is try to handle better each and every day.  Thanks for sharing, lets hunt for some 5lb+ Largies again bud!  MTBF"
418389,Greencoachdog,2010-01-04 01:23:00,8163,  Don't let Kevin do that!... he eats those things yanno!
418395,BillM,2010-01-04 01:32:00,17367,"That was about 18 mistakes in a row, lol..  At least you learned from it."
418410,Fishing 24/7,2010-01-04 02:01:00,709,  name 5 more please for the sake of education
418414,Whitespinnerbait,2010-01-04 02:10:00,2038,The last mistake you made was releasing it...you should have left it on shore would have made it easier for the snapping turtles to feast on its Dead carcass...
418416,pike slayer,2010-01-04 02:12:00,1177,smoooooth!!! is that one of his gills hanging out that your putting back in before that graceful release?? hahaha
418418,e-z-out,2010-01-04 02:23:00,1052,We have all made a few mistakes as newbies as long as we learn so we don't make them again.
418434,muskymatt,2010-01-04 03:09:00,2608,Only mistake you made was not bonking it and havin some dinner.......
418443,Stoty,2010-01-04 04:13:00,2910,"I'm just curious as to why you would post this?? Kinda cooking your own goose, no?"
418460,xeon,2010-01-04 08:37:00,350,First mistake was thinking that it was a big pike.
418468,Whitespinnerbait,2010-01-04 11:35:00,2038,  
418474,ChrisK,2010-01-04 11:46:00,2772,I wouldn't worry about that pike . He'll probably made it believe it or not.  They are pretty tenacious little buggers. We have caught them in Nippissing with half their mandibles and snout ripped off unbelievably enough and some with gills and eye balls missing and they still recover to chase lures around and get hooked up again. Live and learn.....
418509,anders,2010-01-04 15:20:00,1168,I was thinking it was going to be much worse than that.  Lessoned learned for sure
418510,lookinforwalleye,2010-01-04 15:24:00,4399,Well thats 2:06 seconds of my life I will never get back!!
418607,Fishing 24/7,2010-01-04 20:53:00,709,  why would i post this you ask.   to show the evolution of anglers.  this was 5-6 year back and now i would never do such things to a fish.  the wasnt his gill sticking out it was his jaw bone.  when i first dug it out of my computer i was laughing and got traumatized at the same time...  hate it or love it.  thats just the way the angling life is.  note: i would never eat a pike form that baie.........  this is from the ottawa river HELLO!
418609,Flappn,2010-01-04 20:57:00,245,I would agree that pike prb survived.....feisty tough little buggers.
418639,Leecher,2010-01-04 22:34:00,7832,Don't sweat it Kev..... I've seen a lot worse than that I'm sure he's still swimming around that bay somewhere... hardy species Jacques
418924,Fishing 24/7,2010-01-05 21:14:00,709,  well hard to say after dropping it on his head he wasnt all there if oyu know what i mean.   youv seen worse.... or done worse  :)  i know back in the days people would catch a big pike. bring it home to show there dad and chuck it in the garbage after exposing it 12 houres in the summer sun.  
418926,jimmer,2010-01-05 21:25:00,2730,Looked like the tongue to me.
419138,Stoty,2010-01-06 08:39:00,2910," Weird.....even when I was 4 yrs old, I never handled a fish quite like that....... It's common sense if you ask me.  How would you like to be dropped on your head, and have your jaw bone ripped out.... Probably not too much eh?"
419244,highdrifter,2010-01-06 19:58:00,2534, 4yrs old huh??  C'mon eh!!  Ya know..  I've seen worse from grownups.  At least Kev gets it.  There's some rubes out there who never will.  HD
