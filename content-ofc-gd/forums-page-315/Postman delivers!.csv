I jump outta bed, quickly put on some jogging pants and race to the front of my apartment. As I am traversing my hallway I notice there is someone standing at the top of my stairs IN my apartment! Holy f I say, I quickly recognize the postal outfit. Phewf. He hands me a box. I smile, now get the f outta my house. He would've died if he hadn't been holding my new fishing gear. Turns out the wife didn't lock the door when she left to shop. Alls well that ends well I guess lol"

781561,SirWhite,2013-04-23 00:26:00,210,No I'm above a shop on a busy street. Basically my door opens to my stairs. He must of thought it was just an entrance to a store? I'm not sure but it blew my mind. It would have been totally unacceptable if he was not delivering my new reel lol
