780997,Rizzo,2013-04-20 12:33:00,4754,woke up to snow this morning in KW...at least the wife says I know longer have to clean the garage today
780999,Big Cliff,2013-04-20 12:39:00,6899,"Snow here too this morning, 30 K winds high of 1Â° C. Will spring ever come?"
781001,Terry,2013-04-20 12:40:00,14456,just remember that Global Warming can cause the next ice age  just saying   lol
781008,Dave Bailey,2013-04-20 13:44:00,1641,"Global warming = climate change. No reputable climate scientist claims that the warming will be evenly distributed. Some areas may actually get colder and wetter, and some computer models are suggesting that the notheastern quarter of North America may be one such area. Sucks to be us."
781014,knightfisher,2013-04-20 14:13:00,237,"Global warming was changed to climate change because the facts did not hold true to the models that gore tried to hood wink us with. Reading the United Nations Weather modifcation treaty of 1977 proved that various Nations had the technology back then to change weather. Now if that was written 35 years ago and signed by many countries, could you imagine what technology has been developed since then. And of course governments and military have an impecable record of honesty over the years....I will never drink the kool-aid."
781028,t4runner,2013-04-20 15:02:00,37,It was snowing in Oakville this morning...
781040,Beans,2013-04-20 15:51:00,3339, Spring !!!...What happened ???  
781086,Twocoda,2013-04-20 18:33:00,4130,I think I seen a bunch of pissed off migratory birds De icing their wings
781233,Dave Bailey,2013-04-21 04:07:00,1641," Garbage, nothing was 'changed'. Anyone with a high-school knowledge of science will understand that warming the atmosphere will cause climate change, the two go together, and have for billions of years. And Gore has nothing to do with it, global warming was first predicted about 150 years ago."
781248,Rizzo,2013-04-21 12:06:00,4754,-5 this morning in kw
781256,Roy,2013-04-21 13:00:00,13728,"Was -1cat 4am in Boucherville, QC. Now it's a balmy 0c , clear skies, feels like -5, winds are NW @ 17km/h, humidity 39%, BP 103.7kPa and rising, visibility 16km, sunset will be at 19:48 and ceiling...well, the sky's the limit."
781257,woodenboater,2013-04-21 13:05:00,2277,"It's from 2010 but I trust it's provenance  Whatever is happening, I think we're on the start of a really bad roller coaster ride.  http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/coldweather-2009.html"
781259,danc,2013-04-21 13:15:00,4677,-14C here in the Bay at 9 am.
781264,lew,2013-04-21 13:28:00,12766,Sunny and 82F in the Kawartha's  Think I'll go for a swim
781292,Dave Bailey,2013-04-21 15:49:00,1641," Hey, bartender, I'll have whatever he's drinking."
781301,Toad Hunter,2013-04-21 16:28:00,261,"Majority of atmospheric temps. are controlled by radiant heat off of the earths surface. As temps go up ->so do sea levels, thus covering more of the earths surface and limiting the amount of radiant heat available and as a result - eventual colder temps.... at least this was my (mis?)understanding."
781305,OhioFisherman,2013-04-21 16:57:00,6623,"The farmers in my area are already complaining that they are 2 weeks behind getting into their fields. It's been colder than normal and wetter than normal.  Last year was er... normal, at least until May hit and the rain stopped and the heat was record setting.  2011, Noah was building arks here, it seemed like some farmers didn't catch a dry break to plant until the end of June.  Abnormal may be the new normal?"
