780266,hotsky,2013-04-17 03:13:00,400,"Anyone had luck fishing for trout at Spencer Creek? Is the run still on (east of Coots)? I've been there twice now; Sunday and today no luck but water was pea soup, very high and quite fast. Today was a little better but still no luck.  Anything else the creek can be good for later on other than suckers?"

780280,Rich,2013-04-17 09:37:00,3927,"Yeah, certainly not the best place to get a bow but hey, anything's possible."
780288,hotsky,2013-04-17 11:42:00,400,"I did a search on the forum and read that they lift the barrier in the fall till spring to let the fun go thru. Is that true?  Also in one of the ditches (cant really call it a creek) that run into Spencer I saw a few rainbows when I was there on Sunday, so I think they are there."
780303,Mike Pike,2013-04-17 12:53:00,1332,I drove by Cootes Drive on Sunday and saw a bunch of you guys there.  I though y'all were fishing the sucker run.  Looked like a busy place.
781034,fishboy,2013-04-20 15:19:00,550,"based on the number of suckers that were lifted over the barrier last week, the run is on"
