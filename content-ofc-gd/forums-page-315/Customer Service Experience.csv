I broke the tip off my 2 year old crucial, being an idiot and reeling down a snag on a stump and the trying you pop it off. I even lost the broken tip. I live in Peterborough which is convenient, but I drove it down to the Shimano Warehouse here in town they asked we for my name and address and  where I had bought it, thats it, no receipt request or warranty paperwork found around the cork or foam required. I was literally in there for maybe 5 mins. Less than 2 weeks later, a brand new crucial arrives in the mail, asking only for a signature ( no shipping or tax charges . Now granted it had foam butt instead of cork which the broken one was and which I prefer, but I can learn to deal. In a world of bad experiences when it comes to ""limited"" warranties I have had a couple really good ones with shimano, and thus why I would continue to buy their product and dont mind paying $150 + bucks for items when they stand behind them."
780537,BillM,2013-04-18 13:53:00,17367,Can't beat customer service like that.  I had a similar experience with St.Croix after I snapped my Avid about 6inches above the handle on a big pike.  $20US for shipping and I had a brand new 1pc rod in my hands in about 2 weeks.
780538,musky_hunter,2013-04-18 13:57:00,328,Ur lucky it wasn't a NRX
780545,mike rousseau,2013-04-18 14:26:00,4661,That's great...  It seams to me that more companies are standing behind their products...  My family has had 4 st croix rods replaced in as many years... Just have to ship the broken rod to st croix and pay shipping back... Usually $40 total...
780549,mr blizzard,2013-04-18 14:52:00,1589,"Nice to hear a good news story, glad it work out for you."
780560,lew,2013-04-18 15:28:00,12766,"I've dealt with the Perterboro office a few times myself, and each time it was as if I was their most important customer."
780563,lookinforwalleye,2013-04-18 15:50:00,4399,Ditto on Shimano had a Crucial replaced a couple of years ago no questions asked. And that is why most of my gear is Shimano and will continue to be Shimano!!!
780564,bare foot wader,2013-04-18 15:59:00,1354,"I've had very pleasant dealings with the folks there, they sent me an unsigned rebate cheque the bank wouldn't cash...so they sent me a new cheque with a ball cap too, great to deal with  but most importantly, did you happen to notice that beautiful gray expoxy floor? that would be my handy work lol"
780571,Fish4Eyes,2013-04-18 17:00:00,1022,"Customer service is a big component of a successful company, especially in todays competitive market. Good to see and hear that alot of companies have jumped ship.  Buying a rod that comes with lifetime warranty is well worth the investment especially in the long term. I bought a 50$ Compre in a sale bin and broke 2 already and had them replaced with no issues."
780580,fishindude,2013-04-18 17:21:00,220,"I could only hope that if my Shimano gear ever needs service/replacement, I get treated with the same service as you have. Always hearing good things from their Peterborough service centre."
780718,Ron,2013-04-19 04:04:00,1683,"Hey, I installed the new warranty  entrance door.  "
780731,Roy,2013-04-19 11:02:00,13728,The way it should be....Shimano stands behind their rods and Ron stands behind the door.
780744,Shloim,2013-04-19 12:00:00,515,I broke a borrowed Clarus rod and had it replaced with no issues.
780780,bigugli,2013-04-19 16:56:00,6138,Nice to hear they've upped their game at Shimano. Was only a few years back when they would not stand behind the snapped bail wires on their Stradics.
