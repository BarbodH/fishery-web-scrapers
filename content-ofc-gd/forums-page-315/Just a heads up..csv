The agency says 200,000 trout yearlings will be released into the lakes through late May. The restocking began last week in Lake Erie off Sandusky and Fairport Harbor then headed to stops off Erie, Pa., and Dunkirk, N.Y. The Lake Ontario restocking will follow in mid-May. The yearlings are the first raised in the Allegheny National Fish Hatchery in Warren, Pa., since an incurable fish virus was detected there in 2005. The hatchery was decontaminated and received trout brood stock and eggs from other hatcheries. "
781237,Twocoda,2013-04-21 05:41:00,4130,Erie trout populations have been very healthy this side of the lake in the western basin... But we Are accepting passport free fish as long as you guys keep raising  them.... In return... We will give you all the cormorants you want for target practice...  Hows that for a free trade.? How come it took so long to get the program back up and running... And what type of trout are they releasing
781287,OhioFisherman,2013-04-21 15:19:00,6623,"LOL Two, that's discrimination! I can swim, is this a color issue? Cormorants? Like we need more, they enjoy the tropical weather on this side of the lake. Hmmm... for target practice? I am sure the NRA here would support that issue, the gun nuts might run out of morning doves, er... or people.  I haven't fished in years now, seasonally it didn't seem to be too hard to find a steelhead or few years ago, even when smallie fishing. I would imagine the stocking would be limited to them, it's more of a warm water fishery here, and judging by their past luck with Salmon they probably won't go there again."
