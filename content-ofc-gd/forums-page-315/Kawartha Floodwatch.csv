I guess they got a pile of rain further north and water is pouring into the Trent system form the Burnt and Gull Rivers  Kawartha Region Conservation Authority (KRCA) has issued a Flood Watch for Kawartha Lakes specifically the shoreline areas of Balsam, Cameron and Sturgeon Lakes and the northern portion of Pigeon Lake. Water levels are expected to increase over the weekend and next week. There is the potential for flooding to occur along shorelines, in near shore areas, and in low-lying areas.  Peter"

They will hold it back till the eyes spawn, then let it all go and leave eggs high and dry! I hope they hold the lakes at max capacity, cause as soon as its in lake O, its gone for good!  S."
