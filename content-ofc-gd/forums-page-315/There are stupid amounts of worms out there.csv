780704,Cudz,2013-04-19 03:04:00,2652,I have an area to get worms beside my house and tonight I went out to get a couple.  In a 10 square foot area I counted over 30 big crawlers.  I took about 10.  If you need crawlers now is the time to get them.  They are mating and there are hundreds available. PM me if you live in Barrie and need some.  I can let you know where they are (they are probably in any field but this spot I know is crazy thick with them)
