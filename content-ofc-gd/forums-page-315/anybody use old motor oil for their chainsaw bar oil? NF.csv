781130,chris.brock,2013-04-20 21:23:00,4053,Anyone have experience with this? I'm guessing it will fly off more. I always have lots of old motor oil in the garage (oil changes) and it seems logical. I could also spray the chain with some chain lube for motor cycle and ATV chains.  thanks
781136,davey buoy,2013-04-20 21:41:00,5505,"Not motor oil Chris,but I used 32 or 46 hydraulic oil depending on outdoor temps.No color to it so it's a bit hard to know when you run out.. Any oil is better than no oil,but the life of your chain may not last as long or stay as sharp as with using ""bar oil""."
781144,aplumma,2013-04-20 22:19:00,6896,The viscosity is really different and it does not cling to the bar as it should. The oil also is full of dirt and acids from the combustion process. Both will cause shortened life of your bar and the chain.   Art

781149,mr blizzard,2013-04-20 22:31:00,1589,"Agree 100 percent, for the amount of a chain saw replacement or even a guide bar and chain why comprimise on the integrity of the oil."
781155,Sinker,2013-04-20 22:46:00,8692,It will also clog up the oil pump on your saw.  S.
781156,chris.brock,2013-04-20 22:50:00,4053," burning it in the woodstove mostly, some at the campfire  funny sidenote, I remember meeting this group of campers near Opasatika, they had their outdoor campfire in a wash machine tub, and would pour their used motor oil into the bottom of the tub to keep the big logs burning, it worked perfect, a steady, big flames fire environmentally and fume wise, probably not good"
781159,kickingfrog,2013-04-20 22:54:00,8333,"If it were to work, I wouldn't use the wood in my house."
781162,bigugli,2013-04-20 22:57:00,6138,"A lot of tree crews I worked with used to use good old used  motor oil as bar oil. I did the same for many years. With today's saws I would not try it. As already mentioned, viscosity is a big part of it. Also, the newer saw is a much more precise piece of machinery,  having higher running temperatures. Dirt and debris from the old oil plays havock  with the drive sprocket over time let alone increased wear on the bar and chain."
781249,GYPSY400,2013-04-21 12:17:00,191,I use what ever oil I have handy ( lighter stuff in winter) but I don't use used oil as I don't want to mess up my reservoir or feed line with dirt.
781295,Tootsie II,2013-04-21 15:57:00,162,"Correct me if I'm wrong guys, but isn't bar chain oil a mineral based product that will biodegrade after a time while old oil will contaminate the area you cut in for a long time. I'd also be concerned about plugging up the oil feed system."
781304,davey buoy,2013-04-21 16:50:00,5505,"You couold be right,but he would still have to filter that engine oil through some type of mesh filter to avoid clogging up the pump."
781388,bigbuck,2013-04-22 01:23:00,2449,"Chainsaw bar oil is not that expensive for what it does. Just because you could use old used motor oil does not mean you should. Dont mess with your chainsaw, it is not worth it."
781410,pics,2013-04-22 05:43:00,1268,Ten bucks for a gallon of bar oil at TSC(about 3.7l)...$7 for a liter at home depot and $3.50 at Home hardware..cheaper than a new bar nd chain..
