780977,bigugli,2013-04-20 08:54:00,6138,Hope to see lots of OFC friends today. I know a few members have tables there.  Stop by and say Hi! 1095 Fennel at the bowling alley.
780983,Handlebarz,2013-04-20 10:45:00,3790,Have a great time guys
780985,Rizzo,2013-04-20 10:50:00,4754,what kind of things are being swapped? Can you just buy instead of swap? What is the timing? Do I need to have a table to swap things? Geez I have a lot of questions don't I? Did you notice that was another question? Never been to one of these things before but might be in Hamilton today.
780996,Rizzo,2013-04-20 12:27:00,4754,ok just googled it...and ended up right back on this site in the announcements section.
781072,Christopheraaron,2013-04-20 18:08:00,3525,"Was a great time, saw Brian, Bruce (and his son), Dundas steelheader, Kelvin, fish farmer, and I think I saw Albert lurking around too"
781082,Twocoda,2013-04-20 18:26:00,4130,Rizzo.... Did you put Red bull in your coffee maker instead of water?
781085,Loonietoon,2013-04-20 18:28:00,1450,Great seeing you again Chris.. you make me so jealous with all those nice lures you tied  you have a lot of talent
781087,misfish,2013-04-20 18:34:00,29133,"We hit two snow flurry storms on the way. Unreal winds. The same on the way home. Still snowing.GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR  Yep,lots of OFC members there. Behind you was Jose,and three tables down was uncle buck (Goran) Good to see the byes again. Nice flys Chris,and yes,you do a fine tye. Got a few good deals. Nice to see that it grew from last year. One guy had a great collection of old lures and reels. My pop said he remembered using alot of them when he was a kid. Yup,he,s old.LOL"
781096,bigugli,2013-04-20 19:26:00,6138,"Saw so many OFCer's I lost count. Was great to see you all, just the same.  Thank you for coming out and patronizing. I think the swap and sale was a big success. Casey was so tuckered out he was horizontal before anyone else in the clan."
781106,misfish,2013-04-20 20:13:00,29133,"Bruce,just had some salsa dip. YO SON you nailed this one."

My buddy's and myself (old Guy's) were saying see that young guy trying fly's, isn't it great a young kid like that is into fishing, like that, and doing such great work. Glad to meet you Chris, sorry we couldn't have talked more. I saw lots of OFC guys, Brian,Bruce, Hometown, and bought some of the famous salsa from Bruce. Those that didn't go missed a great swap."
781253,hammercarp,2013-04-21 12:32:00,964,Had to work.
781271,rocket09,2013-04-21 13:56:00,18,"Great tackle swap, great people and some great deal on tackle. Adding the second room really increased the amount of tackle and deals to be found, as a dealer who does most of the tackle swaps in south western ontario this is getting better and better every year. chris."
781329,phatpelkey,2013-04-21 21:02:00,78,I would like to know about this also!!
