780423,BillM,2013-04-17 22:00:00,17367, Ouch!
780447,tb4me,2013-04-17 23:52:00,3295,That made me laugh..I like your thinking there. The US national anthem was totally sung by the crowd in Boston loud and clear..Nice! Nice pregame show too
780572,Lunkerhunter,2013-04-18 17:03:00,455,infowars.com  quite a bit of information including some pretty crazy pictures. pretty wild stuff. many pictures on there worth looking at if your interested.
780584,Jigger,2013-04-18 17:53:00,1237,"Not everything is a conspiracy. My condolences go out to the victims of the bombings of April 15 in Boston and Iraq. Youll have to go through about 20 pages of Google until you find it. But its there with more (x10)casualties and roughly same number of injured. Doesnt quite stir your passion? Sorry to hear that. There are over 7000000000 people in the world. People come and people go. Want to see just how often and how trivial it is? Visit here to know that you and I, in the end, amount to this.  http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/  Not to our friends and families, hopefully. But to the rest of the world, these events will fade.  Be good to people when you have the chance and just be thankful you have what you have because things can change in a hurry. Sorry for the rant. Bright side is, itll be forgotten"
780588,lew,2013-04-18 18:08:00,12766,"Yeah, ain't that the truth"
780589,Headhunter,2013-04-18 18:13:00,5703,"Most of us can't relate to the nasty things people do to other people in places we don't really know, or come from for that matter. Most of us on this board can realte to the folks in Boston and some have friends and family there. Once again, our collective sense of security and safety has be compromised and people are expressing their shock and grief. Seems these days, every day is a bad day for the innocent... HH"
780779,moxie,2013-04-19 16:36:00,1566,"                  What did I tell yaz?  Ok, so it was a limited public execution but it had the desired outcome. We don't need to know why. We just need to stomp them out,  One down, one more worthless piece of  _H_T to go."
780931,BillM,2013-04-20 01:23:00,17367,"Well it looks like suspect #2 is in custody.  No public hangings for you guys, lol."
780265,Freshtrax,2013-04-17 03:09:00,2215,Makes me sick....no need to make it a public execution ....just throw them in general population.   They won't live 30 days.
780267,Sinker,2013-04-17 03:18:00,8692,These kinds of guys are protected from general population!!!!  That's what really burns me the most!!!  S.
780270,moxie,2013-04-17 03:31:00,1566,Oops
780272,moxie,2013-04-17 03:41:00,1566,investigators. I won a class spelling bee in Gr 6 you know.
780282,Rich,2013-04-17 10:09:00,3927,"When they go to jail, they will have a fate worse than death waiting for them."
780283,GarageDoorGuy,2013-04-17 11:10:00,10,Give these fools cement shoes and make them fish food... Only a sick low life would do such things
780290,Sinker,2013-04-17 12:01:00,8692,"Rich, they will get a protected cell all to themselves. Its Bull! One 25 cent bullet would suffice!   S."
780291,Harrison,2013-04-17 12:02:00,2202,Forget execution. 10 mins alone with Dad would be enough.  I do not even want to imagine how that man feels right now.
780293,Sinker,2013-04-17 12:11:00,8692,Right on Phil!  All these guys are concerned about the criminal!!  S.
780294,BillM,2013-04-17 12:13:00,17367,They aren't going to find out who did this...
780332,BucktownAngler,2013-04-17 14:50:00,582, i doubt that. this was the most photographed area in the US at the time.
780334,BillM,2013-04-17 15:05:00,17367, I hope I'm wrong.
780335,ch312,2013-04-17 15:09:00,1590, very well said.   it's sad that anyone would have any sympathy for whoever did this. the perpetrator deserves to be dragged behind a truck or simply tossed into a room with the family members of the victims for true justice to be served. it's no wonder criminals in canada are treated so well with all these bleeding hearts around...
780338,mr blizzard,2013-04-17 15:20:00,1589,"We all know what these cowards deserve and I am sure they will get it, apparently they do have a couple of people of interest already, continued prayers need to go out to all of those affected, the authorities will take care of the rest."
780339,BillM,2013-04-17 15:21:00,17367,Who has sympathy for these guys?
780353,jedimaster,2013-04-17 17:19:00,3472,Cnn is reporting they have or know who it is. Dark skinned but they are implying he is saudi or muslim.
780359,jedimaster,2013-04-17 17:46:00,3472,Now saying an arrest has been made in the bombing.
780360,BucktownAngler,2013-04-17 17:48:00,582,that didnt take long. great news!!
780361,BillM,2013-04-17 17:49:00,17367,Fantastic news!!  Although I wouldn't want to be that guy....  eek.
780363,Headhunter,2013-04-17 17:58:00,5703,"The perps will be treated as terrorists, like the Oklahoma bombers... once found guilty, they will be executed. If they can find Bin Laden in a poop hole in Pakistan, they'll find the scum that did this crime. Sooner or later, they will get their man. I'll keep my thoughts on a suitable punishment to myself... HH"
780367,jedimaster,2013-04-17 18:30:00,3472,Omg now cnn just said there has not been an arrest. I am at home sick today watching the news. This is just fascinating. There is a press conference at 5pm apparently to update on details. Supposedly there are pictures and video of the person putting the second bomb down and then running away after they went off.
780368,BillM,2013-04-17 18:32:00,17367, Crazy eh?   Story changes every 30 seconds.
780371,jedimaster,2013-04-17 18:37:00,3472,Crazy is an understatement.
780376,davey buoy,2013-04-17 19:04:00,5505,"They'll get him/them,not to worry!"
780387,anders,2013-04-17 19:37:00,1168,"When they do catch him/them, they should send him to the TD Garden so the 16000 angry Bruins fans can have there way with him."
780008,mike rousseau,2013-04-15 23:59:00,4661,I have family that ran the marathon.... She was only about a mile away when the explosion occurred...  Very scary day
780019,jedimaster,2013-04-16 00:33:00,3472,Two of my cousins run marathons in the states but both missed this year. Was happy to hear them both checking in.  Good news for your family Mike.
780027,Nipfisher,2013-04-16 00:57:00,2449,For those of you who care to see the graphic images from todays explosions here is a link. 2 of the images are quite graphic and have warnings attached to them. http://slideshow.nbcnews.com/slideshow/news/boston-marathon-bombing-51547100/
780028,moxie,2013-04-16 00:58:00,1566,If it was in fact an attack and regardless of whether it was carried out by dissidents or foreign I think it might be time to bring back public executions. Eye for an eye instead of this hug a thug and throw them back into society bulls#!t. Hope of a kinder gentler world is becoming a scarce commodity. As blessed as we are to live in this part of the world it saddens me to know that I will have to one day have to leave my children behind.
780046,Sinker,2013-04-16 01:33:00,8692,"I'm with ya moxie. Whack 'em! Nobody who could do something like that deserves to live.  That may sound harsh, but just imagine if it was your mother, father, brother, sister that was just killed by these pieces of garbage!  Get rid of them. They won't be missed.  S."
780056,Grimace,2013-04-16 01:41:00,2020,A kinder gentler world via public execution?  Sounds like a brilliant idea there Chief.  Nothing quite like a good old fashioned hanging or be-heading to warm the heart.
780066,BillM,2013-04-16 01:51:00,17367,Public execution?  You guys have been drinking right?
780071,bigugli,2013-04-16 02:04:00,6138,"I have no problem with leaving those perpetrating terrorism, or treason, swinging from the gibbet for all to see."
780087,BillM,2013-04-16 02:57:00,17367, I'm sure the kids would love that.
780090,Sinker,2013-04-16 03:31:00,8692,You'd rather these types walk?  Maybe that's what kids are missing nowadays?  S.
780093,Grimace,2013-04-16 03:46:00,2020,Maybe kids are missing public executions?  I would hope this is just hyperbole.
780095,Sinker,2013-04-16 03:56:00,8692,"What's your suggestion, Grimace? I'm open minded. Maybe public execution IS a little harsh, but it would sure get some attention!  Eye for an eye works for me.  S."
780096,Grimace,2013-04-16 04:02:00,2020,"No one wants them to 'walk'. You are being very disingenuous with that type of argument.  If you want to have a reasonable discussion on the matter, then you must proceed with at least a little bit of intellectual honesty.  Giving choices of one extreme or the other is, for a lack of a better word, dumb....."
780097,Grimace,2013-04-16 04:06:00,2020,"It would get some attention alright.  I know a few places where public executions take place all the time.  The same places where terrorism is rampant and theocratic fascism is king.  I can not even believe that I am entertaining this argument.  Be honest just for a few seconds, do you want to live in a society where you gather around the town square and watch the executions with your family?  Give your head a shake...."
780100,Sinker,2013-04-16 05:02:00,8692,"Ok, so public execution was the wrong way to put it. That, I will agree with.  Maybe execution was more suited to what I was thinking. I'd have no issues with that whatsoever.  S."
780101,fishing n autograph,2013-04-16 06:13:00,2540,Well the Boston pd knows something. They just executed a search warrant in Revere
780103,Rich,2013-04-16 09:25:00,3927,No kidding.  You guys should be ashamed of yourselves. That's just as sick as the original crime.
780112,lew,2013-04-16 11:16:00,12766,Watching the news this morning and their talking about the 8 year old boy that was killed. Their saying now that his mother is in grave condition with a brain injury and his 6 year old sister had her leg blown off.
780120,jedimaster,2013-04-16 13:22:00,3472,And they were there to watch there father cross the finish line.
780130,NAW,2013-04-16 14:16:00,4022,That's horrific.  Just Brutal!
780136,ctranter,2013-04-16 14:34:00,543,"This false dichotomy is rediculous.  Public executions vs. ""letting them walk"",?? I seriously doubt some of you have anything past an eight grade education.  Let reason prevail.  Let the invesigators investigate.  Save the fear-mongering and speculation for a forum that endorses that kind of tripe.  Some of what has been said here makes me sick."
780146,doubleheader,2013-04-16 15:55:00,497,"Yes it's a crazy sad world, and I'll continue to send my prayers to all those who have been killed or injured and their families. Hopefully the authorties will get to the bottom of this and bring them to justice. Sad day in the States."
780166,davey buoy,2013-04-16 18:46:00,5505,"Innocent kid,bystanders,what else should they do if they are caught? Should the taxpayers of the States have to foot the bill for long term prison time? Will be interesting what happens going forward."
780252,Sinker,2013-04-17 01:55:00,8692,"Let reason prevail? Its bleeding hearts like you that think these people deserve rights.  Someone set a bomb, with the intention of killing innocent, harmless people. Women and children!! So far we have an 8 year old boy dead, his mother seriously injured, and his sister with her leg blown off......and you want to talk reasoning??  Give Your head a shake.  The person that did this deserves far worse than a simple execution. I know there are many others that agree, but won't write it here. Speak up. Its coculd be your mother, son, or daughter next!  You call this fear mongering?? Innocent people were slaughtered for no reason! If you don't fear that, dare I ask what you do fear?  S."
780261,moxie,2013-04-17 02:40:00,1566,Thank you. I knew I'd catch a at least one Lib. There cannot be an intelligent conversation with a Lib cause they always think their way is the only way.          Edited cause I've never been trained in the art of Liberal Warfare. I appreciate the education Grimace.

779943,misfish,2013-04-15 20:23:00,29133,Reporters need to stop saying BOMB EXPLOSION. The explosion came from a restaurant..

779946,woodenboater,2013-04-15 20:37:00,2277,2 more devices have been found and detonated. There are some horrible photos from the scene that will not be used I guarantee.
779947,davey buoy,2013-04-15 20:38:00,5505,That's what I'm hearing as well.
779949,Gerritt,2013-04-15 20:41:00,6129,Yup intentional bombing... sick people in this world..
779950,jedimaster,2013-04-15 20:41:00,3472,The pictures show two different locations. Unlikely it was just an accidental explosion from a restaurant.
779951,davey buoy,2013-04-15 20:44:00,5505,"Timing was bang on,even from a restaurant. Unless that was the wick that started the burn?."
779952,woodenboater,2013-04-15 20:44:00,2277,Not to make this political but I wish news readers would stop referencing AQ. They don't know that so don't make things worse than they are.  I hope they find whoever planned this and deal with them appropriately.

Is the NYP wrong or are BPD keeping things tight for obvious reasons ?  Just hope people don't jump to conclusions

779973,bigugli,2013-04-15 22:32:00,6138,"This is nothing new. Bombings, targetting women and children, bystanders, have gone on non stop since '39' and earlier. What's new is the fact that this behaviour has finally made it across the pond, and hitting North America in a big way The biggest mistake we have made is this. We welcome all sorts from the war torn regions of the world. People with stronger allegiances  to their old world than to this new world that took them in. They bring their disputes grievances and wars here and  carry on in their wars at our expense. There needs to be tighter restrictions and screening, and thinking long and hard before welcoming folks from regions caught up in long term war and feuds."
779974,BillM,2013-04-15 22:36:00,17367," That was an electrical fire, nothing to do with the two IED's going off at the marathon.  I also think people need to stop assuming this was an attack from the East, or are people forgetting about Oklahoma?"

779988,jedimaster,2013-04-15 23:03:00,3472,"Sickening, deplorable so many words. one of the dead is an 8 year old. No doubt there to watch a family member or friend running the race. I hope they figure out who did this quickly. I just pray this isn't a war sparking event."
