780771,Moosebunk,2013-04-19 15:27:00,3970,Friend of mine shared this recently posted 1/2 hour Youtube video of a few doods beating up on Lake Superior's steelies and other trout.  Some cool footage and a real sense of fish adventure well captured.  Figured I'd post the link here for any interested.     Enjoy.

780958,Moosebunk,2013-04-20 02:13:00,3970,"WTG Brian.  You captured in Misfishinewfienese what they captured on vid. lol.  Andy Cap... barely remember but do. lol.   Tuned in from time to time today on what was happening in Boston.  Simply sad and sickening really.  And over the last week the big threads here have been the Algonquin Land Claim, Nipissing Gill Nets, Bad Politics and of course... crappy weather. lol.  I get it... they all effect fishing and anglers of the OFC and actually are good things to know...  (feel for ya too Dan)... but they're bummers doods. lol.  Got word yesterday that I will have to again have to shave my beard off for work... that sucks biznalli-sacaronis too.  Watched this video last night and it took me away for awhile and, got me even more excited for several adventures coming this summer.  Glad it did something for some of yas here as well!"
