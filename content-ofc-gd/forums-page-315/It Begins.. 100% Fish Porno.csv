This weekend won't be great , but next week ill be back into never sleep mode as ill be on these guys whenever im not at work. Lol  First fish of season for me 14lbs and eric's first a fat 11. Lots of smaller ones and bullheads biting.        No need to draw attention to one trib. ANY lake erie trib with some depth and muddy flats has these guys in it, and they grow well over 20lbs in all of them. Get on em. They were taking cut up spottail shiners and a few hits on cut sucker meat."
780844,misfish,2013-04-19 21:11:00,29133,"That stringer has good eats Rich. You need to take a vid of cleaning them. Nailing their heads to a board,and ripping the skin off. Been awhile since I had whiskers for a dinner,but cleaning them was a blast."
780847,Jigger,2013-04-19 21:21:00,1237,"Thread of the day. Thanks Rich, some sweet cats right there!"
780848,Rich,2013-04-19 21:31:00,3927,"My grandpa used to do it that way. He nailed them to a tree and took pliers to each side. He loved bullheads, as is where my love for their sweet spring fillets comes from. He always said ""a fish you can fillet without a knife is meant to be eaten""  I however live in an apartment, with a clean girlfriend who wouldn't appreciate me nailing catfish to boards in the kitchen. So I do it the pansy way and cut the head off, then fillet like a perch. Haha"
780850,misfish,2013-04-19 21:37:00,29133," Condo living aint no different.LOL  Memories of yer grandpa was cool. Had an uncle that was the same. I was going to fillet a walleye,he yells out,just gut it and scale,dont waste it.LOL"

781266,mr blizzard,2013-04-21 13:30:00,1589,"Never caught one, but would being interesting watching as mentioned a video on how to fillet one sounds like a bit of a process, nice catch, glad u had a great day fishing."
781286,Tayzak15,2013-04-21 15:03:00,318,"This...I've never caught one, but they do look challenging to clean. Nice catch!"
781306,hotsky,2013-04-21 17:13:00,400,I've heard a lot about Erie catfish run. What about lake Ontario trips?
781317,Rich,2013-04-21 19:47:00,3927,"I know when i lived in the hammer, we got them like crazy at the mouth of the desjardins and up into valley inn, was good til the beginning of june. I have no experience fishing them on any other lake O tribs, but after looking at the mouth of bronte i'd bet it's really good off that pier at night."
