778962,NBTroutFish,2013-04-11 12:51:00,2,"Hey guys, I'm coming from New Brunswick to Hamilton for a week to visit a friend of mine, and one of the days I'm in town he's away to Rochester for work. Like to bring my gear and fish the Harbor because I've heard it's pretty good. what kind of set up and lures should I bring, and what can I expect to target this time of year? I'll be there the weekend of April 20th. Any Help would be awesome!"
778965,BillM,2013-04-11 13:17:00,17367,"I'd probably hit the piers that are close to Hamilton, Bronte etc.   You can toss baits such as J13 Rapalas, 1oz Cleos, etc etc.   If there are any browns around I'm sure you'll get bit."
778966,Mike Pike,2013-04-11 13:17:00,1332,"If you enjoy casting, you can try the pier under the Skyway bridge.  That's the mouth of the harbour and guys cast for Bows and Browns there this time of year.  Cleos and Kastmasters are my my favourite spoons.  Have a nice visit."
780493,NBTroutFish,2013-04-18 03:31:00,2,Thanks for the help guys. Fingers crossed I can hook into a big brown. We don't have any big ones around here like i've seen pics from Hamilton Harbour
780604,fishsevern,2013-04-18 19:12:00,112,"Good luck for the trout, seen some nice browns and bows off the skyway pier (lake side) off lures listed above.  Also seen them hooked off the pier casting roe in the shallower water on the beach side, early morning or before dark best.  I'll be looking for carp this weekend.  If you see any in your travels, please let me know."
