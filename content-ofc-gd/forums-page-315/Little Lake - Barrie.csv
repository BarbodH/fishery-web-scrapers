780758,Shloim,2013-04-19 13:54:00,515,Meant ill pay him
780762,BillM,2013-04-19 13:59:00,17367, No fish in what lake?  Little Lake?   read the thread again.
780787,jimmer,2013-04-19 17:39:00,2730,That lake always amazes me. It has huge pressure but still produces. Crappie and Pike are the main spring targets. Lawrence Park has the best boats if you're renting.
780789,Acountdeleted,2013-04-19 18:09:00,2562,There is one pike in that lake. I caught him. It was fun.
780799,misfish,2013-04-19 18:33:00,29133," Well,there yer answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
780803,Shloim,2013-04-19 18:39:00,515,Ill bet there is at least 2 in there...
780817,misfish,2013-04-19 19:52:00,29133, LOL You have a sense of humor. GOOD ON YA.
780885,Shloim,2013-04-19 23:45:00,515,I called actually and the woman on the phone said too early still... Nobody has been out yet
780899,NAW,2013-04-20 00:35:00,4022,Nobody has been out yet because pike and bass are closed.  And I don't know if people eat fish from little lake.
780901,misfish,2013-04-20 00:39:00,29133,"Ok heres a short history on Little lake for me.  One weekend back in 1983,my first youngest brother asked if I wanted to go to said lake. It was late July.,Bass and pike were open. He had been there a week before and said it was a fun lake to fish. So off we were, early that saturday morning. Arrive,at the park . There were about 12 tinnies,and 4 pontoons,with hoods/covers.We took a tinny for our outing. I let him tour me around the lake as he had been there before I. Being brought up all my young life then on top water for bass,i had a black hulla hopper,tied to my only rod i brought.(it wasnt til I fished bass tourneys,I didnt know I needed to have a dozen or so on the boat)  This day turned out to be so exciting. We fished the shoreline and pads.  (again,brought up this way) Just a great day we had catching . The bass were huge. Well they were.3-4 lb largies. Thought we were bass pros.LOL  That day was a great day of fishing. We made plans,to go again in two weeks.  Ah heres where a great memory comes out of me.I still LMAO  My first son was 3 yoa. I told the mrs I was taking him fishing til noon with my brother.We would be back by dinner time. This time we didnt rent a tinny,we rented a pontoon. With a roof/cover. We had a portable bbq to make hotdogs and a cooler full of kiddie stuff. .  I was very carefull with my young lad. I took the car seat out and secured it to the picnic table that was on the pontoon, I even had a PFD for him.  It was a great day spent with my brother and son. Catching fish,listening to my son laugh.It was a super day That was til I,,,,,,,,,,,,  Ran out of diapers. OK,Need to head home. So we reel up and,head to shore and head for home,before the next one is used up..Back then,we didnt have a cell,well maybe there was,but we didnt have them. When I got home,I had wished we stayed longerThe mrs,s wasnt to pleased. But what women is when yer late,and have their first born out fishing..  Since that day and the others back then,that lake has fished amazingly with all the pressure it has has over the years. Here we are,2013 and I still catch the same amount of fish I did back in the day with my brother and young son.  Lets hope it fishes the same,many years from here."
780947,Shloim,2013-04-20 01:43:00,515,That's a great story all of us with kids can relate to. I have a son that's 9 now and hates fishing...
780207,fisherman7,2013-04-16 22:13:00,325,Is ice free from what I could see from Hwy 400
780208,misfish,2013-04-16 22:15:00,29133,"Yup.,get the float tube out."
780209,davey buoy,2013-04-16 22:17:00,5505,"Yesterday,not.What a difference a day makes!!"
780287,NAW,2013-04-17 11:32:00,4022,Ya. That was a nice view this morning.
780456,Shloim,2013-04-18 00:24:00,515,What kind if fish are in there? Anything in season?
780477,Cudz,2013-04-18 01:46:00,2652,"pike, walleye, lmb crappie.  I think crappie is in season, maybe"
780577,NAW,2013-04-18 17:11:00,4022,Water level is up big time this spring.  I wonder if it's like this every spring?   I know the water level this past summer where very very low..    This is the launch... 
780583,davey buoy,2013-04-18 17:51:00,5505,"I've never seen that launch Nick?,can you say where or PM. Thanks Dave."
780587,NAW,2013-04-18 17:58:00,4022,It's the launch at Lawrence Park.  It's a pay launch.  You can also rent the pontoon boats there.
780590,Shloim,2013-04-18 18:16:00,515,Is there a spot where a cheapskate might throw in a canoe for free?
780591,davey buoy,2013-04-18 18:17:00,5505,No .lol.
780592,davey buoy,2013-04-18 18:18:00,5505,"Thanks,that's the further launch?,I believe."
780593,NAW,2013-04-18 18:25:00,4022,I've dumped a canoe in there for free about 10 years ago.  Not sure if you are still allowed to these days.  Not likely!
780594,kickingfrog,2013-04-18 18:26:00,8333,I've never paid to put my canoe in. I've also paddled into the lake from both ends.
780596,davey buoy,2013-04-18 18:33:00,5505,Some drop it off at the end of Duckworth where I used to do. Not sure if it is still allowed.Parking may be a issue?.
780597,NAW,2013-04-18 18:47:00,4022,I think you mean duckworth..  And I don't think you can park there anymore...  I'm sure you could find a place to toss in a canoe...  Or the guy who runs the launch doesn't charge much to park there..  A few bucks..
780599,davey buoy,2013-04-18 19:03:00,5505,"Sorry,Duckworth,lol.Cedar park,the guy is great,$5 or less ,including parking."
780666,Cudz,2013-04-19 00:07:00,2652,Not sure about the no parking.  I ice fished little lake once this winter and I parked at the end of Duckworth
780668,misfish,2013-04-19 00:16:00,29133,"LMAO at all posts,"
780676,NAW,2013-04-19 00:37:00,4022,
780682,Shloim,2013-04-19 00:48:00,515,I used to wire houses off of duck worth 10 years ago. Too bad I didn't fish then....
780705,Cudz,2013-04-19 03:06:00,2652,You are laughing because you know there are no fish in that lake.          
780709,misfish,2013-04-19 03:10:00,29133,
780712,t4runner,2013-04-19 03:48:00,37,Lots of small pikes in that lake.
780756,jimmer,2013-04-19 13:48:00,2730,Don't be cheap. Those people have to make a living also!
