I dont want to use it for that, i want to use it to wrap my cords used for my gps on the boat. Is there something better to use ( i dont want to use heat wrap that is what i am replacing)  Thanks in advance"
781370,Ainsley,2013-04-22 00:29:00,142,The product I use is called tech-flex. I use it to dress up single cables or groups of cables. I think I picked mine up online.
