781308,Raf,2013-04-21 18:10:00,3495, it really is amazing the difference 10-20km/hr makes on your fuel bill and each vehicle seems to have a sweet spot in terms of speed vs fuel economy.   i  get 21mpg on the hwy in my v8 grand cherokee if i keep it under 110 and drive smooth and this is with not-so-fuel-economy-friendly all-terrain tires.

781365,super dave,2013-04-22 00:03:00,323,My bro in law has the hybrid.  Its great on fuel.  He averages 7 litres on 100 km.   But he does constantly complain it doesn't have the power when going up hills and passing.  Also the escapes have a known problem for randomly stalling.   Look it up on Google.  It happened to him.  Had to wait 20 mins and it would start again.   But would stall shortly after.   I read an article about a month ago that ford isconsidering recalling all 2009 and above for this problem.  I would do some research before jumping in. Good luck.
781403,mikeh,2013-04-22 02:38:00,824,there was a sale on the newer ones in the paper last week for around $19k. they were 2wd but I think they have traction control on the rear wheels. The financing on a 2008 is 5 years and on a new one I think it's 7 years.hope this helps
781409,Sinker,2013-04-22 04:27:00,8692,"Whoever it was that said the subaru's can't pull hasn't driven one! Mine pulls my 16ft deep and wide starcraft with a 40 tiller, bowmount, 2 deep cycles, and all the gear from ice out till sept, then from sept till ice up, I haul the boat plus 6 dozen decoys and all the rest of the gear in it,no problem. I tour all over the place with it a couple times a week. I also have more torque and HP than the escape.  Sorry this has nothing to do with the escape, but you can't go wrong with a forester for what your looking at!  My hunting partner just traded in his escape because of never ending problems. My forester hauled his 16 lund fury home for him when it left him stranded on the side of the road.  Don't knock it till you try it, and if you don't know, don't speak!  I've put 260k on the forester, and I tow a lot, carry two kids and a 100lb lab all over the place. I also have a 6x10 landscape trailer I drag around weekly. No problem, tons of power, great brakes, and super reliability.  Ask anyone who has one!  I don't get excellent mileage, but a bit better than the escape with the 6, but I'm turning 4 wheelss all the time.  S."

I have to wait to pull the trigger on something until I talk with my bank... Even though I spent $1000 on gas for the Durango this month the bank doesn't see a ""car payment"".  If I end up with a $160 a month payment for a used car that will save me money in the long run, it still might hurt me with regards to getting my mortage approved for the next house. I'll be saving money over all, but the bank doesn't see it that way.  Until then I'll do some test driving! haha  Thanks again! Ryan"
781479,lookinforwalleye,2013-04-22 18:08:00,4399,Even though you can write all those expenses off I still say the boss should give you a gas card!  Should we start a FB campaign to get you a gas card.
781042,The Urban Fisherman,2013-04-20 15:51:00,2050,"Hey Guys,  Starting to get sick of spending hundreds of dollars a month on fuel for the 5.7L Dodge Durango.  I love driving it but the fuel economy is beyond terrible at around 12MPG lol.  We purchased it mainly because at the time we needed 3 big bulky car seats to fit side by side and I'm not into driving a mini van.  Now my oldest is in a booster seat which takes up no room, and the boy is in a smaller 5 point booster so I can easily down-size to any SUV out there. Living out in the country means I want 4WD or at the very least AWD and I want to get the most cost effective SUV out there with regards to fuel consumption.  I put in a fair amount of mileage every summer.  I like the look and size of the Ford Escape Hybrids and can afford 2008's with under 100,000K.  My budget maxes out at about $13,000.00 or so.  I'm just wondering if anone here has experience with the Hybrid version of this vehicle.  My boat is small and light so launching and towing with a smaller 4cyl SUV isn't really a problem for me.  Thanks folks - Much appreciated!  Cheers, Ryan"

781067,irishfield,2013-04-20 17:52:00,26272,Calculate the fuel burn dollars vs the monthly payment dollars Ryan and you may find that you should keep driving old faithful !
781070,The Urban Fisherman,2013-04-20 18:03:00,2050," thanks dude - yeah I know the 4 bangers don't have a lot of ""pulling power"" but the boat launch is about 5 minutes from my door step and my boat is just a 15 foot jon boat which weighs next to nothing...   Yep - ginny's working on that Wayne... she's the money cruncher of the family.  Problem is that my employer's house is 3 hours from my door step and we usually leave for shoots from his place so that gets costly.  Also, Ginny drives 30 minutes to the nearst larger towns for groceries, canadian tire stuff like that.  Lastly, I think we're going to get enough money out of selling the Durango and the house sale to cover the $13,000 budget for the vehicle.... I spent $325 in gas in 4 days last week... it was brutal."
781076,lookinforwalleye,2013-04-20 18:22:00,4399,You should get your wonderful employer to supply you with company gas card or better yet a limousine given how good you make him look!!!
781079,Raf,2013-04-20 18:24:00,3495,sounds like you need two vehicles.  i commute 100kms daily and even paying double the insurance for the two i come out ahead with a 2nd econo-box for commuting/grocery runs.  the payback for buying the 2nd vehicle with the fuel savings is something like 18-24 months - after that its like it was free.  mind you my econo box budget was 2.5k.
781083,Raf,2013-04-20 18:27:00,3495,...and i'd consider selling the durango and look at something like an explorer or grand cherokee or (gulp) a minivan in addition to the econobox of choice if you need space - durangos are waay thirsty.  13000 can get you a very nice SUV + a 4 banger in the 01-03 range to beat on.
781088,The Urban Fisherman,2013-04-20 18:41:00,2050," haha thanks - Dave is good to me though and it's my choice to live 3 hours away.  It'd be more convinient for him if I lived closer, but we like it out here, my wife would prefer to be close to her family and for the prices of houses out that way I can get WWWAAAAYYYYYYY more for my money here... ie: I'm building a 4 bedroom house for $210,000   I thought about the two vehicle deal, but I don't want to chance buying a budget car and not make it to shoots because of break downs and such or if I have to make it to the airport in the middle of winter type thing I want the confidence of driving a 4WD vehicle in the snow out in the country.  I load a fair bit of equipment into it as well so it has to be spacious enough for all my camera equipment.  Also - my wife got into a fairly bad accident that's still on her insurance record so our insurance for 2 drivers on 2 vehicles (her being a primary on one) would be expensive for us.   yep thirsty is an understatement to say the least lol I don't care for hte look of the explorer and the cherokee isn't much better on fuel.... I don't want to drive a minivan because I just don't want to drive a minivan haha and because I want 4WD - we live 30 minutes to the nearest large town and over an hour to the nearest cities.  Sometimes we drive to Sudbury to visit family in the winter and I want 4WD or AWD for those occasions as well."

781098,craigdritchie,2013-04-20 19:49:00,1586,"Don't know about the hybrid, but I drive a 2008 Escape 4x4 with the 3.0L gas V6 and just love it. It costs about $65 - $70 to fill it from empty, and that will take me 450 to 475 km in the city. On the highway, I'll get another 80 to 100 km to the tank before I have to refuel.  It's been dealer serviced since new, and I haven't spent a penny on it in 160,000 km, apart from tires, wiper blades and one set of brake pads. Everything else is original.  I've never had any problems getting stuck in mud or snow. Mine's rated to tow 3,500 pounds.  One of my friends is on his second Escape, and he loves it too. Wonderful vehicles - I would buy another one without a second thought."
781099,The Urban Fisherman,2013-04-20 20:00:00,2050," awesome - maybe the hybrid isn't really necessary.  I was looking up the specs and it really shines in the ""city"" but the HWY KMS are virtually the same on the hybrid and regular Escape.  I live out in the country so %90 of my driving is 80 KM/h +."

781127,Ainsley,2013-04-20 21:12:00,142,I was in a similar situation a bit over a year ago and decided on a Subaru forester.  I preferred it to the escape. I ended up with a 2004 with around 130k km. I have snowies on it in the winter and it handles great! Towing capacity on the auto is 2000lbs so it should handle a short run with a light boat.

781140,irishfield,2013-04-20 22:00:00,26272,Just giving this some thought Ryan.. I haven't reset the computer in my F150 x 5.0 Litre in a long time. It's sitting at a 13.4 litres/100km average from city/hwy/towing trailer etc for probably the last year. That is 20.9 Miles per Imperial Gallon and you could tow Dave's boat!

781176,moxie,2013-04-20 23:49:00,1566,You're right Mr Bouck. Let me rephrase that. If you're going to retire the Durango you could look at the complete v6 SUV line up across the spectrum as they'd consume a fraction of what an eight will and still allow for ample towing capacity for your needs. That better Mr Bouck?     ps. I still love parking in those spots with my V8. hehehe
781183,Sharkbait22,2013-04-21 00:23:00,297,"I have a 2007 3L AWD 145k. I pulled a 16.9 ft Legend and skidoo skandic without issue.  The Subs can't pull, didn't have as many features, and suck about the same gas.  The car has been great. Tires wipers etc. replaced but nothing close to major has gone wrong.  Makes me think Ford is alright. Got stuck twice in deep snow but able to get out both times. I have driven a 2010 hybrid version from Kawarthas to Ann Arbor MI and was impressed with the gas mileage and peppiness. I drive a 2012 F150 at work and I'm impressed with the mileage for such a big and capable vehicle. That's some great technology and wish it was in my current Escape.  For my next ride I hope Toyota comes out with a diesel 4Runner and downsizes it back to the pre-2003 model. Is Ford doing anything with the Ranger? Best of luck."
