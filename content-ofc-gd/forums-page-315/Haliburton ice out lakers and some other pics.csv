779717,chris.brock,2013-04-14 23:15:00,4053,"It's still pretty wintery in cottage country, some pretty good snow squalls, lots of ice on the lakes and snow in the bush, the maple sap was still running well this weekend    There was a little open water where Lutterworth Creek dumps into Deep Bay. I went for a little paddle, with the fishing rod, it felt great to be back on the soft water even though most of the lake is still ice covered.    Looking the other way.    I didn't really care about catching anything, but managed to jig up 2 lakers, 1 in the slot, 1 under, both released        Stopped by the Talbot on the way home, didn't see anything except 2 giants washed up on the shore  "
779744,Christopheraaron,2013-04-15 00:56:00,3525,Good fishing! We've been fishing soft water down here for a while now haha
779753,Moosebunk,2013-04-15 01:33:00,3970,Right on Chris!  Most must still be chompin' at the bit to be out there on the softwater already.  You're out there jiggin' 'em up!  Good fishing.
779851,ehg,2013-04-15 14:42:00,2666,Nice report. Actually fishing is the best especially when catching.  When you could fish the Talbot R. by Gamebridge the last week of March was best.  Good stuff!
780070,Joeytier,2013-04-16 01:58:00,3990,Well that's encouraging.  I think it'll be damn near may before I get my paddles wet
780077,Rod Caster,2013-04-16 02:17:00,5784,Cool! I'm ready to inspect the sportspal anyday now!
780079,SirCranksalot,2013-04-16 02:18:00,3291,"Chris,  I've read somewhere about a sub-species called ""Haliburton Gold"". Is that what you caught? Either way, nice looking fish!"
780110,turtle,2013-04-16 11:04:00,274,"Nice fish and photos. I'm not brave enough to get into a canoe in those conditions unless I have to. The ""Haliburton Gold"" strain is native to a few lakes in the Haliburton Forest.  I also recall the local fish hatchery raising and stocking some, don't recall where.  They are supposedly smaller, more prolific and ""gold"".  Never caught one.  The lake trout where I fish look like two distinct strains but I don't know for sure. Either light gray and relatively longer or a darker almost black and shorter and squat."
780116,johnnyb,2013-04-16 12:03:00,3413,"Very nicely done, Chris!  I'd say you're the first guy on Gull this softwater season....keep it goin"
780122,mirogak,2013-04-16 13:27:00,387,"Hey Chris, I am going on a fishing trip in Hali (Bancroft) area for season opener, think it will ice out by then?"
780125,jimmer,2013-04-16 13:37:00,2730,I think the Haliburton Gold strain is also in Mississauga and Catchacoma lakes.
780147,fishindevil,2013-04-16 16:15:00,6254,awesome chris !!! nice early season start...thumbs up
780186,jimmer,2013-04-16 19:41:00,2730,I'm really surprised that you weren't the first one out there.
780189,chris.brock,2013-04-16 20:06:00,4053, Which opener? Haliburton brookies/ lakers are open. I'm assuming you're going into AP for the opener? I'm pretty sure the ice won't be out. I'll be up there again this weekend and update you though.
780275,fishboy,2013-04-17 05:16:00,550,Haliburton Gold are in Halls as well
780381,chris.brock,2013-04-17 19:16:00,4053," yeah, I did abit of reading on them, the strain is stocked in Halls, Esson etc., and native to Redstone, and McDonald and Clear in the Hal. Forest  they stocked Gull for a little while (not sure what strain) but don't anymore, maybe there was some Haliburton gold genes introduced to the population"
780810,moxie,2013-04-19 19:14:00,1566,Sweet Chris. Thanks for sharing.
