715837,ricardo,2012-07-18 20:23:00,26,Thank you. Have u gone there yourself? Any good?
715840,Pikeslayer,2012-07-18 20:30:00,1443,"I don't mean to pooh pooh on your day, but you might want to call them and find out what they charge for each fish caught (you have to keep them all). My admin took her children to a trout pond last summer and it turned into a $100 day for 2 adults & 2 children. That's a lot if your not expecting it.  Sorry, just don't want you to be shocked at the final cost.  Slayer"
715842,ricardo,2012-07-18 20:34:00,26,Thanx for the heads up. I called the number and its a pet groomers. Number must have changed. I was going to go there just with my son (he's 3 so he'll cast only a few times). Want to have a trout on the line to see what the hype is about.
715844,misfish,2012-07-18 20:40:00,29133,"LOL  Go barbless,Fight them,then let the line go slack til they come off. YELL OH DARN,IT GOT OFF.  What a rip off, these places are. I can understand their bussiness,but come on. I can buy a smoked trout cheaper then you can,catching one from them.  I dont mean to be a pooh, pooh, as well."
715869,Musky or Specks,2012-07-18 22:06:00,2710,Teach your son to fly fish and its catch and release 17 + an hour just outside of Cambridge  http://www.lyndonfishhatcheries.com/publicfishing.html  Otherwise its more expensive
715889,smally21,2012-07-18 23:17:00,993,"there is one on either hwy 97 or clyde rd (somewhere around there). it has unusual hours i think.  as previously mentioned, some are a great deal and some are more in the business of selling fish than fishing..."
715972,Rich,2012-07-19 10:30:00,3927,There is also triple t trout farm in waterford on thompson road
715973,Skipper D,2012-07-19 10:41:00,1970,"The worst thing with the pooh pooh , is its over in about ten minutes as its about all you can aford . Fly fishing them is best in thease places as it will take a bit longer . Have fun ."
716035,Woodsman,2012-07-19 13:33:00,1286,There was a place just north New Dundee. SW corner of Huron Rd. & Queen St. Been a couple years since I've been past it so not sure if it's still going. Never fished there myself.
716058,Musky or Specks,2012-07-19 14:46:00,2710,Yes thats the place I posted Use to be called Spring Valley
716063,pics,2012-07-19 15:02:00,1268,Triple t is by far the cheapest option but he is closed until september or so...
716071,Woodsman,2012-07-19 15:10:00,1286,About an 1/2 hr from Cambridge in a car/truck.
716088,AmblinRamblin3,2012-07-19 16:26:00,11,I am pretty sure Coldspring closed down several years ago. The sign on hwy 97 is no longer there. The ponds are likely still there though
716226,ricardo,2012-07-19 22:57:00,26,"Deffinitely going to try a place out. I am also gunna go barbless, set the drag down, fight for a bit then leg it get off the hook. Gunna use big bait with small hooks and hope for the best. Thanks all for the help"
781429,rwilmer,2013-04-22 14:03:00,5,"Have  you tried Wilmer Trout Ponds, north of Durham, on Hwy.#6? 519-369-5717. Their fish are NOT  pellet fed. Good for eating, and the prices are reasonable."
781432,Roy,2013-04-22 14:26:00,13728, How about an introduction?
