781276,dewar,2013-04-21 14:10:00,5,I was just curious if anyone knew of any smelt creeks in and around north bay that were running yet
781279,Muskieman,2013-04-21 14:18:00,2472,"All of Nipissings tributaries south of HWY 17 that flow into the lake on the north shore are closed to all species , including Smelt , MNR were laying fines last spring . I don't know what the boundaries are for the south side . But with the raging waters , I wish you luck in finding any Smelt . I'm thinking this season will be awash ."
781280,Nipfisher,2013-04-21 14:23:00,2449,Smelt have not started here yet. Any creeks that will have them will be PACKED with people as the MNR have enforced the sactuary rules and the hot-spots are off limits.
781291,Rod Caster,2013-04-21 15:38:00,5784,"Haven't really done good surveying this year.... I don't think I'll be able to get them this year....that's ok, I'll take a spring steelhead trip over smelting anyday! Can't wait for Tuesday!"
781311,dewar,2013-04-21 18:53:00,5,"I agree steelhead over smelt would definitely be a better option, haha I was thinking more off heading east on 63 to try and find some smelt"
781326,Rod Caster,2013-04-21 20:43:00,5784,"The only lake down Hwy 63 that I know has smelt is Talon, but I've never actually fished it. Can't think of any other lakes on 63 with smelt."
