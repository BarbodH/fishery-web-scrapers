780543,muskymatt,2013-04-18 14:23:00,2608,"I've been listening to RUSH since about 1978 and they have been my favorite ever since. While I don't listen to their stuff after Grace under pressure as often as the stuff up to GUP you can't deny they have a ton of material and most of it is amazing. They belong in the HOF, its a shame it took this long.  Congrats RUSH and thanks for 36 years of listening pleasure!!!!"
780544,ccmtcanada,2013-04-18 14:24:00,7971,"It's about time!!!   They have never been a band who needs or seeks accolades, but it's great to see them recognized!   Geddy Lee said ""my mom is excited about it, so for that its worth it"".  All class."

Total class act. He invited me into his garage and we had a drink on the hood of his 'benz.  Shot the @#$t for a good 1/2hr. I still have my word order signed and framed on the wall."

780606,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-18 19:20:00,8243,"Paid an entire dollar to see them at The Rock Pile in Hamilton in 70's. My buddy was bouncing there and we helped them load the van on a Saturday night. 10 years latter I see Getty Lee at a Blue Jays game, he says hey your the guy from Hamilton. Real people, never rock stars."
