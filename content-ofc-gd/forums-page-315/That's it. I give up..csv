780898,danc,2013-04-20 00:31:00,4677,"Snow, snow, and more snow. Today, April 19, 2013, yes April 19, we had  a major blizzard. I haven't heard how much we got officially but with 70 km winds, it doesn't matter. Snow drifts were 2 and 3 feet, maybe more. Snow was falling horizontally all morning and into the afternoon. I spent the day giving my Ariens deluxe 28 snowblower a workout. So glad I bought that thing a few months ago. I am officially throwing in the towel and give up all hope of summer arriving this year. Forecast for the next week calls for...... more snow.  Maybe I'll get the opportunity to untarp my water taxi next year. Or maybe not.   "
780902,LefroyFisherman,2013-04-20 00:41:00,602,"wow, such a long winter... we have a couple cm's in the forecast for this area, I like winter and all but I don't envy you one bit."
780903,Tayzak15,2013-04-20 00:42:00,318,"The streets were bare 15 mins ago lol, Winter coming back again?   "
780907,danc,2013-04-20 00:47:00,4677,That's the one Tayz. Good luck.
780912,Rizzo,2013-04-20 00:59:00,4754,"crazy...we just had friends move up that way half a year ago. Not that its balmy here, but definitely better than that!"
780919,Tayzak15,2013-04-20 01:11:00,318,Why isn't photobucket working properly?
780923,irishfield,2013-04-20 01:14:00,26272,"Don't worry Roger.. supposed to be snowing down here again tomorrow !!! Far cry from coming out of the school of Architecture yesterday, in Cambridge, and it was 28* C!"
780948,Entropy,2013-04-20 01:44:00,747,And here we were worried about global warming.   Run as fast as you can the White Death is upon us!  Stay safe and enjoy the blower.
780954,moxie,2013-04-20 01:59:00,1566,Real sorry to hear that DC. If you can make it down here for Sunday morning you'd me more than welcome to join us for some Crappie fishing.
780956,danc,2013-04-20 02:02:00,4677,"Actually, the more I think of it, it's a small price to pay for living in the heart of the best freshwater fishing on the planet. I'll get through it guys. Pics coming. In June."
780960,Tayzak15,2013-04-20 02:18:00,318,"Can't agree more the area from Timmins, south to sudbury, out to lake superior and up to thunder bay= best fishing in the world! This winter is just a tease now though haha, I just bought my new boat yesterday down in Toronto before comming back up for the summer from school and we get hit with a storm and now its supposed to be -10 or more the next 2 days."
780961,Moosebunk,2013-04-20 02:20:00,3970,That's the spirit Dan!!!  May 1st  what's going to happen is the heat is just gonna turn on so hot you'll be swimmin' a meltin' tidal wave downhill to Ottawa.  Stop on in for coffee in the boat. lol.
780963,kickingfrog,2013-04-20 02:51:00,8333," What, wait? You're not selling your boat for cheap then? Dang."
780966,danc,2013-04-20 03:09:00,4677,Not yet Rob.
780975,Ron,2013-04-20 06:37:00,1683,"Oh suck it up and take one for the team. The more snow you get up there, the less we get down here. lol"
780979,bigugli,2013-04-20 09:04:00,6138,Just think of how much this helps the lake levels
780984,davey buoy,2013-04-20 10:46:00,5505,Once all settled we should see the lakes up quite a bit compared to last year. Sure hope so!.
780995,kickingfrog,2013-04-20 12:25:00,8333,"That's ok, we just got a dusting on snow in Barrie as well."
781013,Tayzak15,2013-04-20 14:13:00,318,Its supposed to create flooding issues where I'm from in the main river.
781015,OhioFisherman,2013-04-20 14:18:00,6623,"Hmmm... it was snowing here this morning, now let me think, why didn't I go farther north until June? LOL"
781167,Nipfisher,2013-04-20 23:23:00,2449,Saw this today and thought it was appropriate. 
781168,kickingfrog,2013-04-20 23:26:00,8333,I did what I could today to give winter the finger. Barbecued in my shorts and had a beer.
781260,mr blizzard,2013-04-21 13:21:00,1589,"LOL that's how we barbeque here in the winter, gotta try something different, I sorta feel sorry for you because I know u want spring, but find a way to get the snow back up here and I'll take it ALL"
