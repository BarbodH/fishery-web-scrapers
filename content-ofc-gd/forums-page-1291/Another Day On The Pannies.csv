19962,Rich,2007-01-07 16:34:00,3927,"Well we headed to a little different area yesterday in search of perch. All week we have been releasing the panfish so we decided to scrape up a nice meal. GB, Sleded and I got 'em down with live minnows Sleded had netted in the morning. The lines werent in very long before we got into fish. I think by the end we had maybe 12 true keepers, and a bunch that would normally be too small to keep however they had swallowed the hook. Lots of action anyway and a ton of fun. Now for pics:  Sleded decided to use the truck as an ice hut, lol   Jumbo on!   Sleded showing off his BBQ skills as the hibachi bursts into flames, LOL   GB's whopper mud puppy   The bucket of death   Had a great day with you guys lets do 'er again."
