Does anyone have this model and have anything good or bad to say about it !! Does anyone know which mapping software is the best as well for the Garmins ? Thanks"
18546,Frank,2007-01-03 05:24:00,74,"Well, I just went to Bass Pro in Vaughn on Saturday night and bought a ""Garmin eTrex Legend"" and I think it is GREAT!! Although I am fairly new to GPS and this seems like a great beginner to intermediate GPS system.  I have been told that Garmin with the Mapsource software is the best to get."
18588,Smokey,2007-01-03 13:36:00,1278,I have the 60csx and have been using Garmins topo and road guides. It's the best gps I've owwned so far and the colour makes it really easy to read. I haven't got into any marine software yet so I can't comment on it.  Good Luck with it.
