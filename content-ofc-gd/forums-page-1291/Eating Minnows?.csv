20159,ch312,2007-01-08 01:55:00,1590,"ive been thinking about this for quite a while but havent asked anyone about it so i figured this would be a great place to ask.  does anyone eat minnows here? im talking about the 2"" long shiners that are all over everywhere now. i have eaten capelin from nfld. that were smoked whole with guts and all and they taste great so i wouldnt be scared of eating a little cooked minnow guts. im thinking that there cant be any health risks because they are so low on the food chain and larger fish would have more toxins.  i was thinking about netting some, rinsing in salt water to help remove some slime and then tossing them in fish crisp and then pan frying them. im thinking that not many (nobody?) eats them because it would be too time consuming to gut each minnow so nobody bothers.  has anyone tried eating cooked shiners? they cant be that much different then smelt can they?"

20461,Terry,2007-01-08 20:55:00,14456,we use to eat them while they were alive.....yum a friend got 24 down before they came back up...  but really should be the same as a small smelt
20480,skiel,2007-01-08 21:24:00,30,A relative of mine and his buddy ate a few one day when they were out fishing. This was after they had polished of a half a bottle of Jack Daniels and Case of Beer in rather quick order.  I do know that the minnow was alive and he was flapping around for while according to the guy who ate it. Never Puked
20483,pigeonfisher,2007-01-08 21:31:00,696,"who hasn't eaten a minnow on ""the ice"" at least once?"

20486,kemper,2007-01-08 21:35:00,2232,"eating minnows...  How about this, catch the minnows, put them on a hook, catch a pickeral and eat that!"
20488,Fisherman,2007-01-08 21:42:00,7201,"I haven't, however, whats the big deal between a minnow or heering size fish for that matter. Some people eat anchovies on pizza, they're no bigger."
20494,douG,2007-01-08 21:58:00,2693,You can get nasties like parasites if you eat em live.  How can this advice possibly be a surprise?
20496,wolfville,2007-01-08 22:06:00,396,"They are better served alive. Bring some wasabi with you to make it taste even better. Ask Rich, he does it all the time and even had some pic posted.  But then if you know Rich and his speical way of giggling... that may have something to do with eating minnows..."
20514,ch312,2007-01-08 22:35:00,1590,lol ive likely eaten more alive minnows in my life than any of you but im actually serious about eating COOKED minnows.  guess ill just have to try them for myself and see since nobody else has tried them cooked.

20524,trapshooter,2007-01-08 22:48:00,1234,"deep fry or bust!  haha.  Not something I'd do but hey, whatever floats your boat."
20531,watertight,2007-01-08 22:52:00,50,"Hmm, Note to self: Keep an eye on minnow pail if ch312 is around."
20532,ChrisK,2007-01-08 22:53:00,2772,If your going to eat minnows I would highly recomend putting them in a brine for 4 hours and then place in a smoker for about 3 to 4 hours....Serve with cream cheese and crackers....This would be beer drinking food so make shure to have at least half a dozen cold ones in the fridge........per person  Cheers !!!
20554,Woodsman,2007-01-08 23:21:00,1286,"After a few wobblly pops Iv'e been known to consume a couple live ones. But then when I was young I was told "" if it don't stick in your throat, it sure as hell won't stick in your arse, so shut the hell up & eat it""."
20557,Rich,2007-01-08 23:26:00,3927,"mmmmmmm I love them live, chased with some corn whiskey!"
20559,Mike the Pike,2007-01-08 23:35:00,3421,Only chance I had to eat them was when I was in Hawail at a friends relatives I ate everything served except you guessed it the bowl of minnows.  We have all had the goal fish conversation with our buddies first the drinking then comes the dares........................NOT!  I feed them to my walleyes thats it.Or maybe BITEME next time he falls asleep in the cabin.
20570,holdfast,2007-01-08 23:59:00,1813,"Wow I seen alot, and worse...Maybe? a bunch of us Army guys are Smoking and Joking during a rain storm and one of the guys (attention seeker) betted us that he would pick up worms off the road(ashfault) and eat it. No Problems he downed 1,2,3,4. (we're bored now)  Butt!!!!!!! His Girlfriend (shes a looker) drives up and gives him his lunch. EWWWW they swap spit.  hes married to her and is still Serving  Point is YEA you can eat them- but BOIL them first.  other wise from my experience, they do not taste good"
20588,sleded,2007-01-09 01:23:00,96,get R done man!! ill watch and laugh!
20593,GbayGiant,2007-01-09 01:38:00,1780,"I ate a few live ones about 4"" long, inbetween a bottle of John Daniells and a dare from my ice fishing pals, felt a little sick in the mornin but I think it was the Jack."
20629,camillj,2007-01-09 03:44:00,1988,Im with doug on the parasite thing ... too many years in Marine Biology ... too many willies making their way to too many parts of the anatomy in the various stages of their life cycle  .. and no more sushi for me ... EVER .... PERIOD ... there's a reason the cave man made a quest for fire
20632,Steelcat,2007-01-09 03:53:00,191,"Once I had a campfire going, and I had a bucket of minnow close by coz I was planning on some fishing.  Two of them jumped outta bucket and landed into the fire.... MAN they smell good~!  Never had them though (dead or alive).... I can imagine serving them as fish fries"
20641,kennyman,2007-01-09 04:35:00,737,ICH! Literally LOL. Maybe if I pulled them out of a pristine lake and had a few too many (wobbly pops). BUT out of a bait and tackle shop. Have you seen those tanks    . Not for me man. No way!
20665,ccmtcanada,2007-01-09 12:39:00,7971,"I've never eaten them before, but my 4 year old daughter loves to play with the dead ones in our minnow bucket when we are fishing...."
