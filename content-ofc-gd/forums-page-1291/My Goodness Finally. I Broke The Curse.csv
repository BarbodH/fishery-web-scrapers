20578,nautifish,2007-01-09 00:15:00,1416,  That sounds like quiet a dangerous combination that does...Groper & Nauti......Out on the water.....lol  Cheers Jordan...Whopper rich allways smells he only baths once every eight weeks .....lol  And not sure if anyone noticed but if you look on the pictures you will see i am wearing a different hat. Not my dark green BPS camo hat!  I have been looking for this hat since i moved in September and finally found the bloody thing on sunday.  I wore that hat and sure enough my skunk was broken.   I won a thousand dollar perch last yr wearing that hat so i consider it my lucky BB cap.....& Sure enough i was wearing it sunday and i caught a beauty little pike.

20111,nautifish,2007-01-08 00:17:00,1416,Decided to stay home this morning get a little done round the house catch getting hooked on OLN with my cuppa cha & all that before i headed out.  11.30am came everything done got the truck loaded up and off i went.........Went to one of my favorite spots  was not there long when i pulled in this little beauty.      & lemme tell you i was so damn happy when i landed this guy........A local couple were walking by with there dog and looking at me like i was crazy i was so overjoyed  i finally caught my 1st fish of 2007 and a pike to boot.  So changed my lure started to cast again got another hit  which was another pike but i lost it.....    But i was pumped i had  caught a pike so missing the second hit so did not really matter.   An hr passes so i decided to change lures yet again amd move to another spot when i caught this little bass.....No monster but with all the skunks i have had just latley hell i did not care.....Was still a little beauty.   Seen a few fish being pulled in today from perch to bass and my one pike.......I did see one guy pull in a beauty bass and kept a close eye on him to make sure he released it which he did.  So in all a great afternoon out by the water. I am so bloody chuffed you have no idea......lol.......

20230,xrap,2007-01-08 03:23:00,683,"Congrats on the first fish of the year. From hearing all those stories before you fishing with a pikerel rig, was wondering if you caught the pike on the pikerel rig?"
20235,nautifish,2007-01-08 03:27:00,1416,  Nope xwrap  not today however i have caught a landed a pike on a pickeral rig before. As well as two lrg carp...Now that was really fun....lol
20236,xrap,2007-01-08 03:32:00,683,One time at Port Maitland me and my cousin were perch  fishing and he put his rod down to get a drink and i warned him not to because the fishing was super hot at the time and he told me not to worry because there perch can't pull i tin so 2 seconds later his brand new rod goes into the water and he was pissed. Couple mintues later some angler beside us seen it floating and started catsing at it and got it back. So he reeled in the line and at the end of the line were two big sheephead.   What a fun day that was
20237,danc,2007-01-08 03:32:00,4677,Way to go Nauti. I probably won't catch my first fish of the year until May. Congrats!!
20240,Garyv,2007-01-08 03:37:00,547,Nice to see your efforts paid off.  It sure is unusual this time of year to see all the fishing posts with pictures of fishing open water.
20244,nautifish,2007-01-08 03:42:00,1416,  lol xwrap..Sounds like fun.  .I actually have the video of the two carp i caught with the pickeral rig on video. If you wanna see it pm me and i  shall send you the link.  Thanx Danc Thats a real bummer you wont be fishing till may.  Good luck with the course.    Thanx Gary.  Allthough this will be our second yr in a row with no ice in our neck of the woods. I agree it is unusual to see so many fishing posts of fishing in open water But it is great also.....I am lust Lurving it.....lol
20401,kennyman,2007-01-08 18:49:00,737,"Congrats.Nice little gator! I'm jealous as hell. I was skunked my last couple times out too so  I know exactly how you felt.  I would be pumped catching that guy too. Then two seconds later I'd be looking for more. It's funny,  instead of being satisfied, I think catching them makes you even crazier for more."
