19968,woodro,2007-01-07 17:16:00,168,"Check out this tiny Jack I caught in December, weirdest markings ive ever seen on a salmon The Normal side this is where it starts getting a little freeky  and a close up   Any thoughts as to how this could happen?"
19971,urbanangler1990,2007-01-07 17:19:00,933,"wow thats freaky, kinda looks like a steelie??? but wierd look for sure, i have no clue what couldve happend...lol"
19973,Greencoachdog,2007-01-07 17:32:00,8163,"I'd say that was bruises and under the skin bleeding for the cut/injury on the left side of that fish, probably caused by an attack from a larger fish."
19985,FishFinder,2007-01-07 18:03:00,481,"looks like a coho,  i have seen them half black and half normal, some seem to change into spawning colours in sections."
19993,woodro,2007-01-07 18:12:00,168,LOL he's got bed head
20036,Fisherman,2007-01-07 21:02:00,7201,Was that a clipped pelvic(ventral) fin on the right side?
20046,jordan,2007-01-07 21:25:00,136,I have seen that before on other fish not sure if they were salmon or trout. It looks like it was dipped in oil. lol  jordan
20120,tjsa,2007-01-08 00:32:00,1578,"It is definately not a steelie, its a coho, the length of the anal fin and spots on the upper tail are a dead giveaway, As for the blackness, the recent lamprey hole just up behind the gills is what probably caused that. At least, it looks like a lamprey hole to me."
20208,ccmtcanada,2007-01-08 02:48:00,7971,Wow...now that's strange!!! I'd be happy to pull anything out of the water at this point though....LOL
20243,camillj,2007-01-08 03:39:00,1988,"Yep definitely a Coho , and that black stuff is probably an infection from the gash above ... looks like it may have been a narrow escape from an Osprey or some-such ... just a guess"
20421,fishergirl72,2007-01-08 19:34:00,455,LOL @ you and clampet!
20482,kemper,2007-01-08 21:29:00,2232,"White gums, its a coho.  I have seen fish with big dark areas around wounds kinds like that one before, so Im gonna go with the others and say its an infection of sorts...a really organised infection, with straight lines? lol.  Edit- post 900. yikes"
20545,Peter Panfish,2007-01-08 23:07:00,46,I'm with Greencoachdog on this one.
20550,dheitzner,2007-01-08 23:15:00,314, it definately looks like a lamprey mark to me
