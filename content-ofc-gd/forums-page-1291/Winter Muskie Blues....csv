19714,Pigeontroller,2007-01-06 16:24:00,2793,Finally got a rack to hang baits on...Dang i hope my Wife doesn't see these!  
19715,Rich Clemens,2007-01-06 16:31:00,3131,Awe come on ... it's not that many.   Heck - It looks like there is room on there for a few more.  Can't let that empty space go to waste !!!!  I was actually going through mine this morning and making a list of what I need for the coming season.  Couple replacements and maybe something new.
19717,FishFinder,2007-01-06 16:45:00,481,looks... expensive
19720,Crazyhook,2007-01-06 17:02:00,1154,that orange one in the pastic is no good.  please send it to me for proper disposal
19764,Pigeontroller,2007-01-06 19:42:00,2793,"Alright Jamie, should I send the Suicks to Lew for disposal as well?"
19770,Raf,2007-01-06 20:10:00,3495,i will 'dispose' of the two on the far right.
19797,Pigeontroller,2007-01-06 21:51:00,2793,"Maybe I should re-title this thread, ""What don't I need""!  Seriously, like most Muskie anglers, I have more lures than I need!  Its a sickness!"
19801,lew,2007-01-06 22:27:00,12767," Yeah, send those crummy old Suicks  on over here  Dax and I'll look after the disposal for ya, I'm always ready & willing to help out a pal"
19803,musky66,2007-01-06 23:14:00,273,"My father and I are going to make just a few new lures this winter-I figure a couple of super shallow running 'plows' wll round things out nicely., but I have sent away for some lure making supplies to redo some of my spinnerbaits etc. I refuse to but more Musky lures until I actually start using all the ones I already have!"
19807,steve_paul,2007-01-06 23:33:00,658,Very nice collection.  Very jealous.
19812,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-07 00:36:00,0,"I'm drooling   here Dax, nice collection."
19823,GbayGiant,2007-01-07 01:20:00,1780,"How do you like the depth raiders/shallow raiders, far left ? don't have any in my collection but I hear alota guys use them.  I'll dispose of the big rainbow/ far right when you get tired of it."
19825,Pigeontroller,2007-01-07 01:25:00,2793,"One of my favorites, I think I have every colour. Depthraider that is. I like em for fall trolling since they don't like to go over 4mph. Nice to cast too. Shallowraiders(straight) are nice twitchbaits."
19826,Daplumma,2007-01-07 01:25:00,1961,"You could send the suiks down south for a proper disposal,southern style! Joe"
19834,Weekend Angler,2007-01-07 01:57:00,13,"Those must be just your ""Go to"" baits...  Where's the rest?  Seriously those baits all look too new. They need more water time  Yep it's a sickness. I got it narrowed down to around 200 that I carry in 2 main boxes.  #1 A Plano Muskie box. 50 slots for hard baits and all Release Tools: Bolt Cutter, long Needle Nose Pliers, short Needle Nose Pliers and Jaw Spreader  #2 A 70 Litre Sterlite Tote Bin with 24, 3""x2"" PVC downspout sleeves with all my spinnerbaits and bucktails and my big lures. It also holds 2 Plano 3730s. The 3730s hold jigs, plastics and all terminal tackle: Spare leaders, Leader Material and sleeves, Spare hooks, split rings, file and measuring tape and  I put smaller baits in the other one.  I can go portable with a setup I made of PVC Downspout using 9, 12"" pieces duck taped together. I used some heavy wire in one of the sleeves to make a holder for the Release tools. It holds about 10 baits and is perfect for shore fishing."
19843,Pigeontroller,2007-01-07 02:12:00,2793,"I should go move the six I use to the front row! LOL  The vinyl downspouts are a great way to go, 12 fit nicely in a plastic milk crate."
19921,GbayGiant,2007-01-07 07:15:00,1780,
20001,muskymatt,2007-01-07 18:56:00,2608,NIce assortment for sure ...I tend to put mine away so that I can't see them and get depressed LOL  This winter I'll be finishing my muskie room so they will be on display.  Jamie ..what do you want a bulldog for ????All I ever see is a missed hookset LOL
20016,Whopper,2007-01-07 20:06:00,2174,"So bored this morning stood in the musky isle at a local Gander Mountain and stared at baits for an hour. Actually this local store has a lot of musky baits compared to anything else close, seeing how we only have a couple of lakes real close that have any of the toothy critters swimming around in them.  Whopper"
20322,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-01-08 13:41:00,0,"Heck mine are still in the boat, well the ones I was using lately. The others are in the basement.  I may just put the boat away soon, LOL it may be sold so I better get to it when I come back from the Tri Esox Show in Chicago this weekend."
