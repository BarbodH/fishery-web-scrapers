20331,Pigeontroller,2007-01-08 14:17:00,2793,I love the sound of the Japanese guys in that!
20335,lew,2007-01-08 14:27:00,12767,That thing is nuts !!  Anybody remember when the old FLYER at the CNE was considered a wild ride ??  I can still hear those old wooden timbers creaking and groaning under the wheels everytime we went around a bend and I was just waiting for the whole thing to come down like a House of Cards.  Funny how we always jumped right back into line though
20339,Beans,2007-01-08 14:35:00,3339,I was thinking how tame the old wooden rollar coaster at Sunnyside Beach was Lew or was that one before your time?  Tame by to-days standards but we got a few thrills from it...LOL
