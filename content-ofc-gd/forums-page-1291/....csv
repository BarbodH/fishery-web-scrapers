19885,ChrisK,2007-01-07 03:42:00,2772,That definetely looks like a black widow spider...extremely venomus..and the white puff balls are the eggs sacks she deposited before she died....I would get rid of everything before they hatch..

20092,nautifish,2007-01-07 23:27:00,1416,I think spiders are awesome. Black widows are beautiful especially the females. Two summer's ago found one actually nesting in my kicten window at the top of one of my blinds.....I was cleaning them when she actually came at me luckily i was faster than her but she did scare the damn bejeeber's outta me.  I hated to do it but ended up spraying spider spray where she was because i did not fancy hundreds in my kitchen a few months later......
20191,ccmtcanada,2007-01-08 02:23:00,7971,Spiders SUCK!!!!!
20201,wuchikubo,2007-01-08 02:37:00,1114,"I sure hope I don't run across one of them around with my kids, one who likes poking at bugs in the backyard. I might be safe as it doesn't seem to like the GTA but is found on the Bruce Pennisula apparently."
20202,nautifish,2007-01-08 02:39:00,1416,HF  I live in Port dover southwestern ontario and we have them.
20209,irishfield,2007-01-08 02:49:00,26272,"It's like everything these days. Same day shipping around the world and no pest control, causing non-native insects/animals to show up everywhere.  I was getting some rubber parts.... that we were assembling with our plastic parts...... for Isleeves, for the original sized Ipod, shipped in overnight Fedex from China. We'd open the boxes and have bugs fly out. SOP after the first couple boxes was full respirator and bug bomb spray. Who knows what else we could have contracted from that stuff. I did all the work myself on the prototype run and wouldn't let any employees near it."
20257,Carp,2007-01-08 04:15:00,1488,"  I don't mind spiders....as long as they do their thing someplace else. Black Widows in southern Ontario ??? I always thought they were found in warmer climates, but I guess they can hibernate over the winter.  Nautifish, I can understand some people liking spiders, but venomous ones really scare me. Venomous anything scares me."
20312,mrdylan,2007-01-08 13:18:00,111,  Sheesh where do you live?
20368,dustink,2007-01-08 16:28:00,526,"OK....how about a warning before we show close-ups of SPIDERS!!  I about leapped outta my chair!!  Man, I hate spiders!  dk"
