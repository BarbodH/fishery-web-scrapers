20355,charlesn,2007-01-08 15:35:00,551,Good luck to both teams.  I've enjoyed more ncaa football this past fall/winter than ever before in my life and it's great to see young scholar athletes compete so well and so hard for the love of the game as opposed to the love of money.  Charles
20356,Blake,2007-01-08 15:42:00,418,BUCKEYES  all the way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
20364,dustink,2007-01-08 16:13:00,526,Good luck Phil....I think the Buckeyes will handle them by more then 14 pts.  Have fun! dk
20383,brickNblock,2007-01-08 17:12:00,598,Phil.....Buckeyes all the way Bud! Dont know which hat Im going to wear today........ Either the Ohio State or one of the red ones I picked up at last years Lakair....From you of coarse. Florida has great D.........but the 'eyes have the complete package...specially going 12-0...and with a quarterback as Troy.....Look-out is all I have to say. K.....Hats are settled....the twins will be wearing the red ones from you and I'll be wearing the State hat. Gooooooo...Buckeyes
20390,steve_paul,2007-01-08 18:10:00,658,"Hope they win it for you Whopper.   I would have preferred to see them play Michigan again but after their performance in the Rose Bowl, I guess it was the right call picking Florida.  Hopefully the title will at least remain in the Big Ten"
20400,fishdawg,2007-01-08 18:47:00,912,"sorry Phil, but I am hoping that Ohio State loses & that Boise State is crowned national champions (which wont happen but should  )"
