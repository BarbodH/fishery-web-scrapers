20271,taper,2007-01-08 06:25:00,611,Those floater coats were on a few weeks back for $99.99 and they seem like a great jacket. I was told they were clearing out that particular model.
20276,lew,2007-01-08 08:54:00,12767,"CTC has alot of good sales and you can get some great stuff there.  Couple weeks back I picked up a set of pliers/cutters for $10....reg. $40  Their not the best tools on the market, but like Dan says, their great for around the house and you can't beat their warranty."
