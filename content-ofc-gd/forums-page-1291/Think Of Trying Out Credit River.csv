20247,camillj,2007-01-08 03:45:00,1988,"Park at Erindale Park(North side of Dundas west of Hurontario) ... walk north from the bridge (the season is opened up to Burnhamthorpe)... bring all your regular steelhead gear (waders, noodle rod, light line 6lb, small hooks, floats,roe, flies etc - and most important a pair of polaroids) ... good luck and let us know how you make out."
20251,Steelcat,2007-01-08 03:55:00,191,Thanks for your tip   Erindale Park is close to Mississauga UofT right?  I think I'm going to try it sometimes this coming week  Wish me luck
20255,setomonkey,2007-01-08 04:13:00,872,"Yup, close to UofT's Mississauga campus.  Good luck,  Mike"

20262,Hooked,2007-01-08 04:40:00,891,"I was also thinking of trying the Credit, is it open up round the Hwy 5 area?  I could check it out, but too lazy right now."
20273,Carp,2007-01-08 06:28:00,1488,"I spotted 2 guys wading in the middle of the Credit River just south of Brittania Road in Mississauga yesterday. They were too far and I only had a second to look as I drove. Pretty sure that section is closed to fishing until at least the last Sat. in April. Thought they may be doing some kind of fisheries work, but they seemed to be searching the shallow current areas. My first guess is that they were snagging or just plain netting trout.  Unfortunately, I had the kiddies with me or I would have stuck around to make sure those boys had a police escort out of that ravine.  #%@& !!!"
20282,ShaunB,2007-01-08 11:16:00,73,you are goona want to wait a bit after all this rain.  It usually takes the river atleast two days to clear up.
