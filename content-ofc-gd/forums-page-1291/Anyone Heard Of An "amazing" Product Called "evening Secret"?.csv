""So Powerful It Was Banned In 2 States! 100% Guaranteed To Double Your Catches!""  They are selling it for a bargain $200 USD...LOL.  I've visited some other boards who have discussed this and there isn't a clear answer on what this thing does.  Some say it's an underwater light that you can get at BPS for $20.  The website says it attracts plankton, which attracts bait fish, which attract big fish.  Anyone heard of this product?  Or use it?  Or know someone who uses it?  I'd never buy it...I personally think it's a big gimmick...."

20761,Abberz,2007-01-09 18:18:00,140,It may work and to the best of my knowledge the product or similar products available at BPS in the states are illegal to use in Ontario/Canada.
