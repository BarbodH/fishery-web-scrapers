20748,BITEME,2007-01-09 17:53:00,1969,Tybo that stuff is the CATS BUM you wont be dissapointed just keep in mind layering is the key
20757,Tybo,2007-01-09 18:12:00,1373,Hey Pete. Don't think I want too layer up in the summer. Asking about the heat gear. Not the cold gear. teehee.
20765,nel,2007-01-09 18:33:00,52,"The heat gear is good too.  You won't feel as sticky and sweaty as you do when wearing cotton.  Only bad thing about it is it cost about $30+ for each item of clothing... (I have one in loose t-shirt style, which basically became my summer fishing shirt). Also, if it's windy and the boat ride is a bit wet, the shirt dries faster too.  I use a bug jacket on those mosquito days, so I don't know the effect of bugspray on the underarmor material...but I think deet will eat it up... And I've only had the shirt for 1 season, so I can't say anything about the long term durability...  Note: the heat gear is also good in the winter when used as the inner most layer..."
20824,TAH,2007-01-09 21:53:00,133,what is under armor heat gear?
