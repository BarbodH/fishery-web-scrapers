20642,Joey,2007-01-09 05:08:00,9122,It was the first of six episodes on Discovery Channel.  The name's pretty self-explanatory.  Pretty funny.  I loved the tazer part.  Reminded me of that email joke about the guy shooting himself with the tazer.  The sympathic girlfriend has to go tho.  Joey

20671,Steelcat,2007-01-09 13:07:00,191,"All I can say about this show is ""OUCH~!"".  As one of the officer said in that show, no one has ever volunteer to being hit by those things, that's why they were so excited and took so many photographs of his ""injuries""."
