20019,Steelcat,2007-01-07 20:36:00,191,"Finally went for some fishing today.  When we arrived, several people were already fishing.  They all said no fish all day.  We tried and same result as they had. At least we were able to see a ""dying"" Drum slowly cruising in circle close to shore.  Shoreline wild life is also a wonderful scene in a warm January ice free day   Ahhhhh that really cured my itching fingers~!!!!!"

20222,brewster,2007-01-08 03:10:00,8,Hey Steelcat I did the same thing today but in downtown Montreal in the Old Port. Took a thermos of coffee and brought my folding chair. Who a thunk i'd be shore fishin' in Juneuarey!!!! managed to catch 5 perch and 2 walleye. 3 of the perch were fat porkers bigger than the walleye. Met a couple of guys and had a great day. Ya gotta love it!!
20233,Steelcat,2007-01-08 03:25:00,191,Oooo Old Port Montreal~  I was in Montreal for 5 years and never had a chance to fish there.  5 Perch and 2 Walleye is really some good fishing trip especially in January and around Montreal~! Thx for your report
