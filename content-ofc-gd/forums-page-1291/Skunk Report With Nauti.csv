20543,Rich,2007-01-08 23:05:00,3927,"Well Nautifish and I decided we'd try the grand for a little bit this evening.. as we got nearer and nearer I noticed every little ditch was swelled beyond belief which made me think the grand was probably blown.. well sure enough we got there and the water was just flowing like mad.      We gave it a few casts anyway hoping for a pike to be fighting that current.. no such luck.    After about 45 minutes in a few different spots we packed it in. I dont understand why we didnt get anything, that spinnerbait I was throwing looked so tasty.. I almost had a bite of it myself!    Well I hope you enjoyed that spectacular fishing report. Many more to come!"

20552,mason05,2007-01-08 23:20:00,258,"Rich, Somewhere on the grand river's web site you can view the flows through various key points of the river.  I'd check it out it's pretty cool and might save you some gas if conditions are not favourable.  To bad you got skunked.  Corn Nug"
