20099,danc,2007-01-07 23:46:00,4677,"Any Sudbury OFC'ers free tomorrow night? I'll be flying into town tomorrow night for a short course on Tuesday and I might have a few hours to kill. I'm supposed to arrive around 7 pm. I can't make any promises because I have to pick up a rental car and find my hotel etc. But with any luck, I'll have a few hours to spare. Anyone???"
20114,irishfield,2007-01-08 00:24:00,26272,LOL Dan! Have fun if you can!
20116,Handlebarz,2007-01-08 00:27:00,3790,If I were still living there Dan I would love to meet up with ya. Hope someone will
20153,pigeonfisher,2007-01-08 01:45:00,696,there is a GREAT little mexican restaurant that you should hit.  YUMMY.  Don't know what it's called but should be the only one downtown.
20206,tjsa,2007-01-08 02:42:00,1578,"Last time I was in sudbury, which was last august, stopped off at the swiss chalet. Food was good, could hardly walk through the place though. Don' t know what they cleaned their floors with, deer tallow maybe, we were slippin""and slidin"" all over the place, it was actually dangerous to walk in that place, and I am serious about that."
20213,Carp,2007-01-08 03:00:00,1488,  Soap film from the floor mopping probably.  Hope you have time to chill with another OFNCer or two Dan. Have a good trip.
20215,irishfield,2007-01-08 03:03:00,26272,Gee...anyone have access to a school bus? We'll all go up and meet Dan! LOL
20225,nautifish,2007-01-08 03:15:00,1416,  Nope but i have a windstar that will seat Eight will that do?......lol
20228,danc,2007-01-08 03:19:00,4677,"Ha ha... Thanks for the replies guys. I'm not sure if this would have worked out or not anyways, but I thought I'd give it a shot. I haven't been to Sudbury in about 30 years. I'm going for an underground mining training course. I'm actually going under on Tuesday. Should be interesting.  And lastly, I'll bet that our American OFC'ers are scratching their collective heads about the title of this thread. But I'll bet that every one of our Canadian members know exactly where it came from. I'll leave it at that for now. Thanks again guys."
20302,Whopper,2007-01-08 12:55:00,2174,Your right Dan I am scratching my er..... Trying to figure out where the bingo comes in to play.  Whopper

20611,pameladallaire,2007-01-09 02:26:00,470,"You would never guess that ""Stompin Tom Connors"" is my favourite singer.    That should help some people out, but my hubby won't let me play the music in the house."
