20027,Terry,2007-01-07 20:49:00,14456,"Well it looked like a calm day so I thought I would run up to willow beach to go fishing for whitefish in my little folding boat.... I couldn't find a place to park at willow beach... no parking...yeah everywhere had that and no stopping signs ..looks damn unfriendly..so I go to Jacksons point first I forgot the anchor .. so I had the electric  trolling motor in the back of the truck , so I through it in the boat and off I went from Jacksons point...I saw all the boats a few miles out, but  the waves were more then I thought they would be so I stopped and fished a hump part way out to the group of boats  I was marking fish but couldn't get any to bite...using the trolling motor running backwards to try to stay strait over the lure a big wave came right over the back and got me wet....I was only wearing running shoes and it wasn't long before they were wet and cold and the adventure was over..except the half hour ride back in... didn't catch a thing but it was lots of fun getting out fishing......... back at the dock I saw the water seemed black it wa minnows.. millions of them as far as the eye could see I snapped some pictures but it's hard to see them            well that's it of the weekend back to work tomorrow Terry"
20032,Smokey,2007-01-07 20:56:00,1278,Sounds like quite the adventure. Man those minnows are thick in there. Thanks for the report and better luck next outing.
20040,dheitzner,2007-01-07 21:07:00,314,"good report terry, can't wait to get out on the hard water for some whities!"
20041,irishfield,2007-01-07 21:14:00,26272,Daring bugger aren't ya! Could have at least used my square back....lol.\   Minnows like that are the reason that I now always carry one of the kids old butterfly nets in the boat.
20042,jordan,2007-01-07 21:15:00,136,Man that is alot of minnows.......... Nice pics.   jordan
20060,fishindevil,2007-01-07 21:50:00,6254,"nice report & pics terry,well better luck next time,and it would have been nice to scoop a few buckets of those baitfish for use on the whites in a few weeks..cheers"
20100,Greencoachdog,2007-01-07 23:47:00,8163,"You are a braver man than me going out on Simcoe in that bathtub! Always remember, power on and bowfirst into waves. It would have been a heckuva time if you'd actually caught on of those Whities while out in that boat. That's when the real fun starts!  Great report and pics!!!  Glen"
20102,icefisherman,2007-01-07 23:58:00,952,"Terry, nice pictures and report. I hear fish are in 70-80 fow. It will not be easy to ancor in such dept for me as I only have 100' ot rope. May have to get some extra tomorrow.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
20128,Joey,2007-01-08 00:49:00,9122,"Brave man for sure.  Great report, I was wondering what the fishing was going to be like out there with no ice, now I know, don't bring minnows  Thanks Terry.  Joey"
20136,setomonkey,2007-01-08 01:01:00,872,"Amazing that you got out on Simcoe in your folding boat, better luck next time...  Mike"
20148,fishdawg,2007-01-08 01:37:00,912,nice effort Terry - I am sorry ya had to fish from a boat this weekend though - wish it werent so
20157,tjsa,2007-01-08 01:51:00,1578,"Great effort Terry, too bad about getting wet, wear some galoshes next time out, or neoprene waders. I can see the minnows in the pictures also, man, they are thick aren't they."
20160,Terry,2007-01-08 01:55:00,14456,"well at lest I got out fishing one way or the other  wayne, I think the square back would make it a little safer  but I felt safe or I wouldn't go out  on the other hand I did have my floater suit on plus my self inflating lifejacket and a cell phone in a plastic bag....just like a boy scout...be prepared"
20165,wuchikubo,2007-01-08 02:04:00,1114,"Terry, too bad you didn't catch anything, better luck tommorrow.  Yeah, my older bro when to sibbalds on fri and used a small minnow net they found in the trunk and pailed about $40 worth of minnows in a few minutes, which will be great if the ice would just show up before they die on them.  Good luck again, and hope to see some more reports soon.  HF"
20172,ccmtcanada,2007-01-08 02:05:00,7971,"Great report!!! With all that bait fish swimming around, it seems the bigger ones are well fed.  Good luck the next time!"
20291,Harrison,2007-01-08 12:07:00,2202,"There was 2fters out where we were, could of hopped in with us if I knew your boat.  Got it in the memory now Terry."
20303,Terry,2007-01-08 12:57:00,14456,thanks  that would have been the smart thing for me to do..... and I think I will only be out this time of year in a real boat.....and save the folding boat for summer
