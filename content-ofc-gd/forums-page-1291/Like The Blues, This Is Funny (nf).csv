20212,Garyv,2007-01-08 02:59:00,547,Growing up in the Chicago area I learned to love blues misic while I was very young.  Muddy Waters ( McKinley Morganfield ) was my and continues to be my favourite Blues Artist.  A friend sent this clip to me and if you like blues and especially know Muddy's style you should find this funny.  http://www.littleknownblues.com/video/Fami...dy%20Waters.wmv
