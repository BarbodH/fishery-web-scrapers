19774,iceguy,2007-01-06 20:14:00,341,"Made it out early for some whitey action before the wind was  to pick up.Got out to the water, was great for about 45 minuutes and the sceduled wind picked up a couple hours early and my anchor stop sticking to the sandy bottom of Lake Simcoe.  Managed a whitey off a williams and my buddy got one  off a cripple herring  before the wind continued to worsten. So we packed it up called it a day. Might give it a try tomorrow."
19775,Clampet,2007-01-06 20:20:00,1947,Do you eat the Whitefish?
19776,glen,2007-01-06 20:22:00,2641,Why did you block out the back ground?  Nice fish.  Nice to see someone fishing.
19780,woodro,2007-01-06 20:39:00,168,"nice whitie!, a heavy anchor is  key for whities in open water. I think im heading out in the morning, hopefully the winds hold up for us. When is the next time you guys are hittin the water?"
19813,ch312,2007-01-07 00:38:00,1590,what style of anchor works best for sandy bottoms?
19830,iceguy,2007-01-07 01:33:00,341," Didn't Intend to leave the backround out. Most of Simcoe looks like that. I released the fish cause I caught it pretty fast and I assume I was going to get another. Woodro, like to make it tomorrow but I have no one to go with and I have to be back early afternoon. Sucks cause the weather looks good for A.M. How did you make out at Quinte the other day?"
19874,icefisherman,2007-01-07 03:18:00,952,"iceguy,  Great picture. Thanks for posting it. What dept did you find the whities this time of the season? Where did you launch from?

20095,Terry,2007-01-07 23:34:00,14456,"nice to see people out and getting them, even with no ice"
20185,ccmtcanada,2007-01-08 02:14:00,7971,"Great report and congrats on the fish!!! I'm not into ice fishing, so it's great to see open water reports this time of year!"
20198,tjsa,2007-01-08 02:33:00,1578,"I like whitefish, caught so very few of them, but every one I have caught has that look that says.....  ""WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE????""  I didn't sign up for this!!!!"
