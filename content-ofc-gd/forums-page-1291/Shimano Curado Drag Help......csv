19924,lew,2007-01-07 10:03:00,12767,"Your drag washers probably just need to be changed , then your reel should be good to go again. If your not able to do it yourself, any reel repair shop will do it for you.  Little tip .........always loosen the drag off whenever your not fishing, and this allows the washers to expand back to their original shape. They'll work much better, plus it extends their lifetime.  BTW, there's no such thing as a junk Curado"
19936,greenfshrmn,2007-01-07 13:40:00,65,"Are you using braided line on your reel?  If so, look carefully at your spool because sometimes the line itself slides around on the spool giving the impression that the drag is loose."
20246,hrdst1,2007-01-08 03:44:00,4,"thanks lew and greenfisherman.......i'll definately try to replace the drag washer.....hopefully it'll solve the problem....thanks for your help.... tightlines, hrdst1"
20288,Blake,2007-01-08 11:56:00,418,As stated earlier check the line itself on the spool.  When using any of the superlines you must put on a little backing first onto the reel spool and then join the line to the superline and continue spooling.  This prevents line slippage against the spool.  Check this first then replace the washers if necessary.
