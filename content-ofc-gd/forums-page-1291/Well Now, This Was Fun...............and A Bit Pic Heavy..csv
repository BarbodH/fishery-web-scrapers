20607,tjsa,2007-01-09 02:20:00,1578," Thanks for all the responses everyone, happy to entertain you all with my exploits. Sure wish a lot of ya's had ice also for more reports, but I guess that is not going to happen anytime soon. And thats too bad, it's getting down to -16C here tonight, -20C tuesday, and will be down to -22 overnight wednesday. Then by friday, the low is supposed to be 0C overnight   WHAT THE HECK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Lew, I just could not leave the toque behind(although my bud said its not worth it to go all the way back down if its still on the lake) its actually the ONLY one I own, other than a flourescent  orange one for hunting season I own 4 balaclavas, but only one toque, but its an important one to me now.  It probably took my bud and I with all our gear, and a few rest stops for wheezing and breathing, letting the calf and quad muscles rest, 30 minutes to walk out(probably more, didn't time it) but it only took me 17 minutes to go back in and out unladen to retrieve my OFC toque.  Some things in life are just important to oneself."
20138,tjsa,2007-01-08 01:15:00,1578,"The usual for me, up at 4:15, on the road at 6, got home at 5:30,  Went to a stocked rainbow lake, they put 500 yearlings in a few up here in 2005. With the help of the gps and map, we found it. Slowly and carefully, made our way down the 150 ft. slope to the lake, and set up shop near a point. Not a big lake, no minnows in it, strictly crustaceons and shrimp.  Got in and all set by 9:15, first bite by 9:40, but even after taking 20 ft. of line, it was gone. About 15 min. later, another hit on a set line(we were using worms), and the first fish. Didn't fight much coming up, but when it got near the hole, all heck broke loose, and after a few runs, outta the hole it came. First ever rainbow ice fishing for us. The jigging rod(which did not catch the fish, my bud just put the lure and the rod in for scale) is between 24-30 inches long. Jigged for a while, nothing, my bud tried that lure in the fish's yap, something called a Chunky something, supposed to be a great lure in perch colour for walleye, and there are 4 sizes. Also supposed to be deadly for lakers in the 9 cm size, and the action is great with them, dart all over the place. I tried a Williams something or other, and also a white tube, but nada. 1 hr. later, another hit on a set line, different hole, spool spinning like crazy, Action shot. Outta the hole Eggs spewing everywhere The two fish together Mmmmm, spawn Then, a lull, cut some wood, chopped some wood, built the fire, roasted the deer sausages, and smokies, changed lines to other holes, conversation. Around 11:30, my buds line goes down, fast. The fight is on. Coming up the hole Getting a grip on her His three, all together And, that was about it, my bud had a hard hit on his jig sometime after, but the wind came up, and the fishing seemed to just shut down with a low pressure weather pattern moving in. Even though we have ice, and some snow, the south facing hillsides are pretty bare.  Packed up for the trek out, just when it started to lightly snow   Whups, ran out of space for pics,     To finish, heading out across the lake   My bud, with his haul tied onto his auger, slung over his shoulder   Halfway up the flippin hill, 3rd rest stop,   Looking up the hill at my bud, around 40 yds. ahead of me   So, we get back to the truck, and I discover I lost my OFC toque. Dropped everything and let my bud pack it up, walked back through the cut, down the flippin hill(much easier), back onto the lake, and I had dropped it 100 yds. from where we were fishing,    but I couldn't leave it behind. Only took me 17 minutes to go back down and back up to the truck to retreive it, and I climbed the stupid hill without 4 rest stops this time(a lot easier without a bloody 60 lb. pack on)"
