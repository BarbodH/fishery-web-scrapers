19626,snag,2007-01-06 07:27:00,1932,"I'm sick, so I'll be brief.  Must go fish.     Met up with Fidel and fished till 12pm  Had some follows  Expected more  He lost a beauty  I lost this one after we parted company. It just couldn't be interested in the long haul out of the water. Whatever.   The day before I hooked into this expired Esox.  sunning itself on the rocks (hoped it had a lure of mine. Denied). Necro-angling is fun. O.k. I saw it floating and snagged it to perform scientific observations. I have issues.   Then this baby hit and gave me a run for the money.    Here she is   thanks,  bye"
19633,Carp,2007-01-06 08:08:00,1488,"Doesn't look so bad a trip from where my tush is seated.  Keep at it. One of these days you'll find a fish in the lake.  Seriously, it's nice to see someone getting out fishing and even finding a few fish. That dead one doesn't look like it's been expired for very long. Probably choked on dinner or something."
19637,Greencoachdog,2007-01-06 08:45:00,8163,   Do you mean the obvious?.. or is there a physical malady as well?  Great report and pics as always!  Looking at the last pic makes me think that what they used to say about flashbacks in the 70's is actually true.
19638,xrap,2007-01-06 08:55:00,683,"Very nice report, congrats on the awsome fish."
19646,dsn,2007-01-06 12:16:00,1018,Ok thats it!!! How did you get the fishing Gods to be so nice to you when the rest of us are getting skunked no matter what we fish for?  Hmmmm your sick and posting 2:27am in the morning shouldn't you be sleeping?  Maybe not as sick as you think.   dsn   Breakout the Garlic caps bro!1 Boost your immune system
19661,Clampet,2007-01-06 13:35:00,1947,"Dead or Alive. You almost always get your man, er, Pike!"

19698,mrpike,2007-01-06 15:00:00,151,HELLO !  SNAG.  Looks  Like you had a nice days outing on the shorelines of TORONTO . I am really starting to get the shakes  with this weather like it is . IF it is still nice early sunday morning I may give it a go. Down on the water front in mississauga.  Give me a shout if you are up for a shot at it . Would be nice to hook-up with someone who  has the know how. mr.pike
19703,snag,2007-01-06 15:37:00,1932," Yeah, it was fresh.  I actually thought that it may have choked too. Seems to be a very high cause of death for esox. However, lamprey holes with innards poking out were prevelant.   Glen,  That picture has not been altered! See a doctor at once!!!"
19711,fishboy,2007-01-06 16:18:00,550,Beauty pike-congrats.

19743,snag,2007-01-06 17:46:00,1932," I couldn't sleep due to the cough.  You will appreciate the conditions that day, very windy and wavy. Casting into the wind was maddening."
20223,snag,2007-01-08 03:14:00,1932," You know Nigel, that was actually the first thing I thought when I saw her too!  Hey, I was serious about the float tubing there, so let me know again in the spring; I'm in!    Sorry Mr.Pike,  I'm still sick!  Glad you got out though. This week is looking good too!"
