20705,Josh Rogers,2007-01-09 15:05:00,79,Hey guys I have a question that I am hoping one of you may be able to answer. With the warm temps we have been experieincing lately is it possible that some of the steelhead that are coming into the tribs are spring run fish? If they are and the temps drop will they drop back to the lake? Thanks guys.
20712,Josh Rogers,2007-01-09 15:32:00,79,Nobody has any input on this subject?
20715,Mike Pike,2007-01-09 15:42:00,1332,"Give it a bit of time, ATF.  You're a fisherman.  Be patient.  Anyhoo, my understanding is that Steelhead that enter the streams in the fall and reside there over winter are fish who are reacting to spring-like conditions.. ie high water levels and cool temperatures.  It's like a big false run, I guess."
20719,Josh Rogers,2007-01-09 15:51:00,79,So will they stay in the river when the water cools down or will they drop back to the lake?
20722,tonyb,2007-01-09 15:56:00,1637,"The fish will remain in the creek to spawn in the spring.  Some fish have spawned and it is likely that those fish will return to the lake.  If what you are really getting at is ""will I be able to catch steelhead at the rivermouths"" the answer is ABSOLUTELY!  Get out there and go fishing, Tony"
20725,Josh Rogers,2007-01-09 15:59:00,79,I was just wondering. This is the first time I have fished the winter run and it just seems to me that there are tons of fish in the river now and that the spring run may not happen as it is happening now.
20729,Josh Rogers,2007-01-09 16:30:00,79,Thanks for the infor fellas.
