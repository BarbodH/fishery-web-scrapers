20022,Pigeontroller,2007-01-07 20:42:00,2793,"I did some fishin' for trout this morning,  haven't done any float-fishing for years, but after seeing some of the pics here last week I got the itch! I was joined by Charlied...He was a real pleasure to spend the morning with, Charlie was even kind enough to supply some roe!      Charlie landed at least 9 fish and lost a few...      I managed to land 4, lost 2 or 3...     "

20067,charlied,2007-01-07 22:22:00,584,Well Dax it was my pleasure joining you and would do it again anytime.....thanks for the conversation and picture taking.    I tend to wander sometimes and apologize for not being there to take a picture of most of your fish.  Until next time!
20073,b2kptbo,2007-01-07 22:41:00,1505,"""NICE"", good stuff, great pic's..."
20078,setomonkey,2007-01-07 22:50:00,872,"Nice report, you'd think it was spring already, instead of early January, from some of the riverside scenes!  Mike"
20080,Roy,2007-01-07 22:53:00,13728,"DANG, those are nice fish! Congrats! I have caught almost everything that swims in freshwater but never a brown. I need to get together with someone who can put me on a brown trout.  Beautiful pics, thanks loads for the thread/posts."
20133,charlied,2007-01-08 00:59:00,584,ya they can get spooked...but when the water visibility is about 8-10 inches there is no worries on that matter...LOL  Almost all our fish were browns except the first fish I caught was a small steelie but Dax was busy and couldn't take a pic....it had beautiful colours!
20174,ccmtcanada,2007-01-08 02:07:00,7971,It's great to see others pull fish out of the creeks.  I started creek fishing a few weeks ago...been out 4 times and have been skunked!  I had a fish on today and it gave a great fight....only for me to lose it.  Reports like this keep me motivated to try again!
20234,xrap,2007-01-08 03:25:00,683,"Sweet browns, Most of them lucky pretty fresh. Wtg dude"
