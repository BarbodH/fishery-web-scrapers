20670,ccmtcanada,2007-01-09 12:53:00,7971,"Just wanted to throw a few questions out there to the trib fisherpeople out there...  I was just wondering about time of day and trib fishing.  Most of the reports I have seen begin very early in the morning (before sunrise) and end early afternoon.  Is there much action in the evening/night?  It's hard for me to get out in the morning cause of the kids, and was wondering about trying it out in the dark after they are in bed.  Also, there is tons of fishing pressure locally, and I'd assume a little less after dark.  Also, do lighted floats spook fish?  If so, then I suppose I'll be bottom fishing for them with some small floats in the roe bags to lift them from the bottom.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks."
20702,Josh Rogers,2007-01-09 14:54:00,79,I don't think lighted bobbers spook fish. I've caught steelhead all throughout the day. it really just depends on the day and what the fish are doing. If there is less pressure at night that's when I would go. Better spot avaialbility plus you don't have guys hooking into fish all over the place spooking them. Also if the place you fish permits it try some glow in the dark spoons. I have heard they work.
20714,barracuda,2007-01-09 15:41:00,41,Steelhead will hit throughout the day (and night). Sometimes it's just easier to hit fish in the morning or at night because your presentation will be the first they see and there'll be less fishing pressure around. I haven't seen any lighted floats that struck my fancy (especially if you're fishing small stream) but consider lightsticks offered by Blackbird and other companies. They attach to normal floats and perform the job pretty well.

However, with it being so mild, there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to find some active fish at night.  Both presentations you mentioned will work, lighted floats shouldn't spook fish in deeper runs/pools.  Never POP! your float at the end of your drift, regardless of how cool some guys think it is.  You can hook a lot of fish at the end of drifts and reefing your float rig in isn't going to improve your chances.  Tony"
