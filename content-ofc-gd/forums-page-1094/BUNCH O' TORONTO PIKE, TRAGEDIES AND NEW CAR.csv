152341,ehg,2008-01-20 12:39:00,2666,"That's funny stuff, Snag! Your 'Scottish salmon XXX' post was one of the funniest things i've ever seen but this one ain't bad either.  The humour belies the fact that those are real nice Toronto winter Pike.  Thats alot of time and hardcore effort you did for this post.  ehg"
152345,lew,2008-01-20 12:44:00,12767,"Yup, definetely a good laff for a Sunday morning, thanks SNAG, we need more like that  Ever thought of going into the salvaging business ??"
152348,pikehunter,2008-01-20 12:53:00,1659,"Great report and pics. I'm glad to see you retrieved your bike and phone. Is that Neon Legal?  It's pretty neat, looks like a Red Green invention."
152362,Weeds,2008-01-20 14:32:00,782,  Looks alot more truck (frame and suspension) than neon. Would definetly give your insurance company fits though....
152398,Dano,2008-01-20 15:53:00,719,"Nice dredging techniques there snag, and that is one sweet ride. Is that not Conky's kitty?"
152602,1Harringtona,2008-01-21 00:47:00,77,  The insurance would be pretty high I'm guessing because the insurance company would be afraid of the car body falling off. LOL  LOVE the car
152691,snag,2008-01-21 14:35:00,1932,"Thanks all Have a great week!     Thanks Ricola, He's great. He loves fish. Almost fanatical about them. Must be from his mudder?   You got that right. This winter is harder then last year. It's literally taking twice as long to get a fish. Mean Kitty was found in Tommy Thompson Park.   I'm thinking of it. I'm my own best customer. The boss is an idiot and the pay sucks!   I have no idea if it's legal. It was parked at the garage down the street.   I'll give Conky a call to confirm!"
151939,snag,2008-01-18 16:46:00,1932,"Alo' Anglers,  Been busy lately. Ice cover and the high winds have made water availability/visibility poor.  Tragedies have plagued me and I thought of taking a break till spring with all my bad luck.  The worst is that my reliable 2mp camera has been lost. I left it behind after catching some respectable esox a couple weeks ago. Life goes on.  I believe my run of bad luck was from finding this hideous thing Creepy shore doll = Mean kitty= curse    Let me explain, It was windy(90 mile/hr.) and my bike got blown into 30' of water. I went and bought an anchor. came back the next day, trolled for 20 min. and she came back. Some tourist thought I had lobster traps in Toronto harbour! LOL   Bike coming up from the depths. It was bloody embarrassing   Then my cell phone falls into the water later that day. (this pic is 3 days later) I go buy a net an dredge the bottom the next day with no hope in my heart. Suprise! I scoop it up after 1/2 hour! Let it dry for a few days and it still works!!     Pike pics below  Suprise pike in new area   Lunch pike   Poor pic pike   Fatty with a great fight   Became foul hooked so No glory pic to follow   This guy was weak and skinny. If he was human, he'd be in the back of a comic book with sand being kicked in his face by a beach bully. or not. I don't think he'll last the winter   Next day   Yesterday Fight is on       Don't be jealous car lovers. My new sweeeeeeet ride! (if I didn't wear high heels, I would never be able to climb in)   New lure holder   Now get back to work.  S.  "
151943,cranks bait,2008-01-18 16:51:00,721,"Thanks for the laugh.  Great report.  I cannot believe you got your lost items back, especially the phone.  Had some good looking fish there too."
151949,1leggedangler,2008-01-18 17:15:00,364,"One of the most original posts I have ever read, especially the recovery of the lost items. Ingenius and congrats! Now I know why they call you SNAG, Great pike also!  Cheers, 1leg"
151951,fatherof3,2008-01-18 17:22:00,1769,great report and congrats on getting your stuff back
151954,Uncle Buck,2008-01-18 17:30:00,1000,Sweet...  there is a lot of anger in this thing...    it's pretty disturbing... LOL
151958,tbayboy,2008-01-18 17:41:00,1497,Great stories as always Snag.  That is one creepy bad luck bringing doll for sure!
151959,Entropy,2008-01-18 17:43:00,747,Well Done !!

Good to see the pike are still biting and you have some nice waters to fish.  Areas around me have sucked as of late...haha.
151976,snag,2008-01-18 18:47:00,1932," Agreed,  Yet, a closer look may reveal a happier side of mean kitty......"
151984,capt bruce,2008-01-18 19:35:00,820,"Is IT just me , i Noticed that MEAN Kitty at first glance did seam to maybe be part horse ...."
151989,blaque,2008-01-18 19:57:00,2419,"Good read, entertaining report......nice fish  Sweet mudder neon lol......(side note, i may take a bashing for this......but take the ballbag off the hitch......not exactly entertaining runnin into that stuff with young lady family members in the car.....Im all for a little humor, but those things are ridiculous) Im tempted to remove them for people when i see them in a parking lot, and wouldnt mind seeing a ticket issued because of them......sorry its the protective side comin out"
151997,Beans,2008-01-18 21:00:00,3339,A fun report Snag...Thanks for posting...  Congrats on retreiving your bike and cell phone...
152012,setomonkey,2008-01-18 21:23:00,872,I can't believe you were able to get your bike back. Awesome report.  Mike
152020,snag,2008-01-18 21:41:00,1932," It was ridiculous. People laughed at me. The wind was still 80m/hr. & cold  I kept throwing the anchor hoping to feel a metallic ""clunk"" and then pray that the points would snag something on the bike.  The funny thing is that that bike was from the garbage originally. Tempting to leave it at the bottom, likely beside some shopping carts and plastic chairs.  The hardest part was trying to explain to my wife why I had a brand new anchor and wet rope in my car. Oddly, she never asked again and has been very nice to me? Almost......fearful."
152021,snag,2008-01-18 21:41:00,1932, I agree
152032,danc,2008-01-18 22:15:00,4677,What a great read. Thanks for posting..

152066,Greencoachdog,2008-01-19 00:38:00,8163,Excellent Pike Porn Bubba!!!   ... but who needs a damned ol' bicycle when they got a really cool car like that???!!!

152125,snag,2008-01-19 04:17:00,1932," True 'nuff Dawg   Free wheels, can't complain devil!"
152129,GbayGiant,2008-01-19 04:34:00,1780,"LOL, nice report some nice fish too. I have dropped two cell phones in the water so far and they both came back to life, amazing how they do that, my digital camera got rain on it and broke."
