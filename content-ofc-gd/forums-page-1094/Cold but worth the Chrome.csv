152517,silverstreak,2008-01-20 20:54:00,146,Gotta love a decent January Thaw. The best part about them is that fishing can be fast and furious or fish can be spread out. I like the sporatic action in which case you have to walk a river hole to hole or run to run to find chrome. I find this steelheading scanario more challenging hence more rewarding.It also keeps the crowds down a bit. Didn't use a single roe bag as steelies seemed to hunt down Bunny jigs in the stained flows. Saturday's Outing was also challenging as the temps took a nosedive. Edge ice and chrome was the order of the day for those who dared to brave the wind and cold. Glad to get out while I could. 
152520,silverstreak,2008-01-20 21:00:00,146,Here's another that hit a white Riverwood bunny jig. Steelies seemed to be sitting in the runs and tailouts during the stained flow. This is a good indication that fish are on the move. This cold snap will slow them down so here's to the next thaw.
