152179,Fishmaster,2008-01-19 13:53:00,920,MUD..
152242,Squid,2008-01-19 20:36:00,1656,Yep it seems that the operative word for the lower these days is MUD. Might as well call her the lower mudder!! I am chomping at the bit to get down there and do some fishing but this constant wind is really diminishing the chances of catching fish. Would be nice if we could get a week or 2 of -30 so Lake Erie freezes over.
152325,charlied,2008-01-20 05:56:00,584,still mud but clearing....winds have died down abit so it won't take but about 2-3 days to be fishable.
152468,RickyD,2008-01-20 18:56:00,10,"Strong west wind gusts today so I wouldn't bother for a while, that should keep things muddy for a bit longer."
152549,darius,2008-01-20 22:12:00,13,Hey i went this morning and it was mud 2 or 3 people fishing. I went to Port D stayed for 5 min and went home . Winds were too strong.
