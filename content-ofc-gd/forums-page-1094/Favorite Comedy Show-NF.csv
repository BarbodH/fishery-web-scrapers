Just like Charlie's brother...when the bill was coming for dinner I got up and went to bet on the last race...sticking Dano with the bill! Wasn't intentional...just the way it happened! Oh well... he won the tri-factor IN THE 9th, 10th and 11th races! What's the chance of that? If he had of bet a $100 on each race tri-factor he would have went home with 28 grand... not $280! LOL"

152891,pikehunter,2008-01-21 23:35:00,1659,"It's a good TV show, the kid does grab the centre of attention whenever he speaks. In my opinion he makes the show. Charlie has the same attitude to life as my late brother had. Now only if my brother had Charlie's money and lived on Malibu...  I still like Corner Gas and it tops my list for favourite current TV shows."

152944,shane,2008-01-22 01:35:00,652,"Everything I know, I learned from ""The Simpsons"".    Pretty much the only thing I watch on tv anymore.  I get all my laughs and entertainment right here!"
