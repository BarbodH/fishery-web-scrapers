152611,Casey123,2008-01-21 01:56:00,461,"Hi all,  My wife and I are going to head up to North Bay one day this week before i leave on an extended work related trip. We would like to fish a smaller lake for some eyes. I want to be clear, I am not asking for GPS location or your secret honey hole pond that only you and grandpa know about. Just a nice smaller lake as we really dislike the crowds on the Big Nipp. Thanks in advance, Hopefully I can return the fav some day.  :worthy:"
152619,Bernie,2008-01-21 02:27:00,3190,Restoule Lake comes to mind. Have never fished it personally but they are in there. May take some searching on it though as they can be tougher to locate. (or so I have heard)
152801,Casey123,2008-01-21 19:39:00,461,"Berrnie,  Thanks for th eheads up.  I was hoping for a little smaller lake, although we have fished Restoule in the summer.  Cheers,   Michael"

152986,douG,2008-01-22 03:19:00,2693,"Sry, Masterb8t, I have no hlep for  you, but I still feel your pain.  I find a heavy wool blanket can really make that whole evening thing just slide on by.  And Ardbegh."
152989,Bernie,2008-01-22 03:24:00,3190,There is also Nosbonsing and Wasi. Never fished Nosbonsing but I have on Wasi. Both lakes will take lots of determination and patience but there are some nice pickerel in them.
152993,Vtucciarone,2008-01-22 03:32:00,38,"There is a smaller lake Just east of Nippising called Lake Nosbonsing. I've never fished it in winter, but have caught eye,s in the summer"
153046,Deano,2008-01-22 13:06:00,767,"If your looking in Sudbury, right on Ramsey Lake in the heart of the city. Usually not to busy."
153048,Terry,2008-01-22 13:09:00,14456,well zip over to shiningtree there are some great lakes that can be accessed in the winter time and are very hard to get to in the summer

153069,Casey123,2008-01-22 14:19:00,461,"Thanks everyone,  Will post when we get back.  Hopefully we will have some pics of our trip as well."
