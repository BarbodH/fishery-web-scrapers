146458,Dondorfish,2007-12-30 03:43:00,1000,Thanks for the effort and the info. I am sure alot of us will be glad to hear that!   Don
152408,andrew9660,2008-01-20 16:18:00,2,what does black ice mean on the lake? is it good or bad?
152410,Dondorfish,2008-01-20 16:23:00,1000,Black ice is the best and strongest ice. Read somewhere before that 4 inches of black ice is as strong as 8 inches of white ice.  Hope that helps.    Don
152413,andrew9660,2008-01-20 16:32:00,2,I was out in caesarea last night and got 6 not bad size pickeral. The only concern was the really black ice and the ice making alot of noise
152575,lovetofish,2008-01-20 23:14:00,500,"When it is really cold like that, the ice will make noise as it forms too."
152581,Terry,2008-01-20 23:36:00,14456,nothing scarier then being in a fish hut by yourself at 2 in the morning and hearing the sounds of making ice  sometimes it sounds like a freight train coming through
152582,Bernie,2008-01-20 23:47:00,3190,"Had a big rumble at the cottage on Friday night. Woke me up, thats unusual, normally takes a lot to get me up. Probably formed a pressure crack somewhere. It sure was making lots of noise the last couple of nights on Nipissing anyway. Didn't take any ice thickness readings but there were plenty of full size pickups going across."
