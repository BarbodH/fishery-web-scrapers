I am located in Toronto, and want to book a place that has a different variety of fish (and preferably a place where people have had decent luck). Any help would be greatly appreciated.  "
152825,nelly,2008-01-21 20:30:00,256,Welcome to the board codegreen. How far of a drive max in hours or in which area? Just make sure you book early and remember when the openning season for certain fish.

There are tonnes of little creeks around loaded with specs.  It is about a 7 hr drive from Toronto(710 km to be exact if you take the Industrial Road Short Cut. Not recommended if you have hemroids, they should call the maintenance equipment the bumper not the grader.  Anyways it is one of our favourite spots in Ontario."
