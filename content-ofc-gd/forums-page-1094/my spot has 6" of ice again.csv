152788,DT10Sam,2008-01-21 18:38:00,480,"Hi Pickman,  The Narrows is open and not safe as of yet.  Regards, Sam"
152802,jedimaster,2008-01-21 19:41:00,3472,"Where do you guys figure will be decent areas to try this weekend? I am planning to head out for the day on saturday. Was thinking of the lighthouse, the big island or the shipwreck?"
152803,Hawg Hunter,2008-01-21 19:42:00,204,YEP Sams right i could have put a boat in there on sat .  Hawg Hunter
152943,bramptonjerry,2008-01-22 01:34:00,132,hope to see you again in about 3 weeks....keep us posted
152956,DT10Sam,2008-01-22 02:07:00,480," Hi Jedimaster,  Shipwreck is not safe the ice has just covered that area and I would say being new ice it might be about an inch thick. That whole area has new ice and I would wait for a while until you think of going out there. You might get lucky for the weekend however I would be on the cautious side and wait a liitle bit longer.  Best regards, Sam"
153175,Pickman,2008-01-22 18:12:00,4,"Sam, thanks for the info on the narrows, we are heading up to Baycrest on Thursday. Loooking forward to it as we missed out last year due to poor ice."
