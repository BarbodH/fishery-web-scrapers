152658,SlowPoke,2008-01-21 12:09:00,2984,Just a reminder to stay warm today and be prepared. Pack an extra blanket or a coat. Also consider a candle and something to light it.  I spent almost 7 hours on the side of the road last night. It sucked but at least I was prepared!! -Brian
152663,lew,2008-01-21 12:25:00,12767,"I'm heading to London at 9:00 this morning Brian, already got some extra clothes packed."
152665,motv8tr,2008-01-21 12:30:00,2587,"Yup, clothes, blanket, tarp, candles...all part of the emergency kit I keep in the car...along with a few other items....might throw a couple more things in for my trip to uxbridge with my friend and her young lad.  Maureen"
152669,Terry,2008-01-21 12:47:00,14456,"good advise , I should get that stuff in my truck"
152749,shane,2008-01-21 16:53:00,652,"I may be a bit paranoid, but I keep a box in the back of our van with our campstove kit and lantern, extra propane bottles and even some dry soup packets and a jar of coffee.  And a duffell bag with enough  sleeping bags and blankets to keep three or four people comfortable.  As a former cub scout, I think ""Be Prepared"" is good advice."
152851,lew,2008-01-21 21:32:00,12767,"Got back from my round trip to London an hour ago and fortunately the roads were clear and dry and  I didn't need the extra clothing I always pack this time of year.  It's hard to believe after all the snow they received in the Barrie region yesterday, that the corridor between Toronto & London is virtually clear of snow, cept for a light dusting that begins west of Milton.  What a difference a few miles makes."
152853,motv8tr,2008-01-21 21:37:00,2587,"Actually Lew, from what I understand, Barrie didn't get much accumulation, and all the white outs were south of Barrie...now up here in Penetang is a different story   Still haven't had the energy to go out and clear the driveway or front deck from last night's snow fall...  Glad you had a good and safe trip...  Maureen"
152899,mepps,2008-01-21 23:48:00,1301,"It was -30 with the wind here on the east coast, hope its not so bad for you guys!"
153028,SlowPoke,2008-01-22 11:45:00,2984,Yikes Clive! I hope you've been cuddling your sweetie to stay warm! It hasn't been nearly that bad here... even with the windchill maybe -20 at worst. -Brian
