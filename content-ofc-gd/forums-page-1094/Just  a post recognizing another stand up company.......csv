153119,Canuck2fan,2008-01-22 15:55:00,1444,"Just wanted to post a public thank you to the Lindy tackle company for some outstanding customer relations.  Awhile back I bought three of the Thill nite bright fishing floats and really liked being able to nail some chrome in the dark with them. However I constantly ran into a major problem with the battery light stick unit not turning off no matter what I did. I had went through 6 batteries and all six whether the twist on/off or push on/off type they all just eventually stayed on no matter what I did. I wouldn't have minded too much if I could ever find them in stock at 2 or 3 bucks when I would order stuff online. (Twice they were shorted on such orders, by two different companies) Anyhow that meant I had to grab them at the only place I could find them CTC at 5.99 or 6.99 a unit and at that price having them burnt out prematurely was ticking me right off.  I wrote to Lindy in the States and got a response in two days and it included a request for my home addy so they could send me out a replacment. They also admitted there had been some problems, with a couple of redesigns and they were going to send out the newest ones.  Well the mailman just dropped off a box and when I opened it up there were 6 of the new improved model in there!!!  I just wanted to post it here to let everyone know that Lindy is another company that seems to care about it's customer with action not just words....."
153123,irishfield,2008-01-22 15:57:00,26272,I can second them Canuck2Fan.... Ted Takasaki (sp?) wrote me back himself when I complained that my Lindy Tiger tubes fell apart and had them mail me out a replacement pair pronto.
153150,Canuck2fan,2008-01-22 17:03:00,1444, He is still at it then because it was Ted that took care of me too. I was shocked to even hear back on my email..... to get 6 new batteries was very impressive.
153158,TennesseeGuy,2008-01-22 17:15:00,957,Good for you.  Contacting the company has always worked for me.  Works better than complaining to somebody who isn't in a position to remedy the problem.
153160,Mike Pike,2008-01-22 17:22:00,1332,"Wow, that's pretty impressive."
153206,tonyb,2008-01-22 19:52:00,1637,It's nice to hear good news and service everyone once in a while....Thanks!  Kudos to Lindy...they have some great products including my all time favorite Perch spoon...the Techni-Glo Frostee Jigging Spoon!  Tony
153231,Beats,2008-01-22 20:47:00,543,"I bought one of these floats one time a few years back to use for trout at dark.  Same thing happened to me.  I pulled the light out and couldn't get it to turn off.  Never used it again.  Probably threw it out as I'm sure the battery died shortly thereafter.  It's not an expensive item but things should work properly when you buy them.  Like the guy on the Dyson vacuum commercial says, "" I just think things should work properly."""
153262,kennyman,2008-01-22 21:54:00,737,"That is impressive. I'll look at Lindy products with a new confidence. It's great to hear that some companies actually stand behind their products.  Besides that, Ted Takasaki can sure catch wallye can't he? Seems like he'd be fun to fish with. Good on ya Ted   ."
153307,Blake,2008-01-22 23:18:00,418,Lindy is a great company for sure.  Glad they looked after you.
