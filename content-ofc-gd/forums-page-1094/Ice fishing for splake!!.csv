152556,fishindevil,2008-01-20 22:26:00,6254,"Well we usually fish for splake the same way we fish for perch...well at least equipment wise,small jigs,minnows & small spoons ctc,etc....try to find, points,or if you know the lake find any trees that have fallen before the ice came,fish there,any inflowing creeks or springs,as well as edges of green weedbeds if you can find them !!!...splake will hit just about anything just like perch will if they are in a feeding mood, and most times we never fish really deep for them in less than 20ft,with around 10-15 being the best we find,now thats all for the bancroft area,but if i was heading to an area i havnt fished before i would first try and do all of the above forst,so hope this helps,and im sure other members have some info for you as well.....cheers & good-luck"
