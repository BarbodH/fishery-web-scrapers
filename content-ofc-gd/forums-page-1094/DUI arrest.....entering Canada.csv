I agree with you on your likely poll results, but it does no further good to the lad to call him idiotic and stupid. He would, and is, calling himself the same things. However, it happened, and he has to move on with his life, hopefully with no long term damage. I was looking for some advice on whether there was a waiver of some sort, not a lecture. If you were as close to it as I, you too might move from anger to support."
152878,b2kptbo,2008-01-21 22:58:00,1505,"He's welcome to come fishing, but please enough..."
152879,bigcreekdad,2008-01-21 23:00:00,546,B2k.....you are right. too close I guess.
152988,holdfast,2008-01-22 03:21:00,1813,"Hey Big Creek Dad, tell your lad, poop happens, learn from it and Soldier on.  As you asked a simple Question, I will now address Canuck Fan, We Hear Ya, Your Right, and now your my HERO"
153086,Canuck2fan,2008-01-22 14:52:00,1444," I guess we see things different is all, I didn't think I was giving a sermon at all. I was just stating my opinion. Sorry if that rankles you."
153090,Canuck2fan,2008-01-22 15:00:00,1444, I sense some sarcasm here LOL.
153093,kennyman,2008-01-22 15:09:00,737,"Just a quick note here. A couple of my friends were crossing the border a few years back (one with prior arrests eons before that) and they seized the Chevy Blazer they were in. It wasn't even the ""guy with the prior arrests"" truck. They have SOOO MUCH POWER at the borders. Never take it lightly. Ninety nine times out of a hundred you might get across, but that one may really suck.  P.S. They fought for months, but finally got the truck back."
152777,charlesn,2008-01-21 18:15:00,551,"ccmt,  A buddy of mine got stopped at a border crossing once.  Which is good because he sorta looks like Santa Claus and he may have been smuggling elves.  lol  They asked him if he had ever been arrested, he said no.  They asked about a 40+ year old arrest that had been officially expunged from his records!  Somehow they had a record of it, so they do indeed have access to all kinds of info.  This may have been inside as opposed to right at the gate though.  They do seem to have some sort of computer or scanner at the border they pass your passport through so maybe it is all interconnected.  Charles"
152780,ccmtcanada,2008-01-21 18:22:00,7971, Thanks Charles...that answers my question!
152840,brookieman,2008-01-21 21:15:00,68,"It's a little unsettling to me how lightly some on this board take this subject.  Go visit a hospital, an accident scene or a funeral after a DUI and you'll see why both the United States and Canada take this issue so seriously.  Come on guys....."
152844,SlowPoke,2008-01-21 21:21:00,2984,If he has not been convicted he will be scrutinized for admission into Canada the same as yourself.
152858,Canuck2fan,2008-01-21 21:51:00,1444," Hey, lets all be honest the one CRIME that is totally preventable is DUI..... I have told family members and friends the exact same thing. I have no sympathy for it because I make my living on the roads and I start my route about the time the bars let out some mornings. So I do resent people who could put my life at risk over the price of a cab."
152859,Canuck2fan,2008-01-21 21:59:00,1444," I am far from perfect, I'll be the first to admit. That said, I don't think having the opinion I do that driving while under the influence of either alcohol or drugs is dangerous, stupid and idiotic is really that harsh at all. I bet any poll taken anywhere on the subject would pretty much match my sentiments. Maybe you feel different that's your right and more power to you."
