153272,aplumma,2008-01-22 22:24:00,6896,"I'm guessing that a few people have not been introduced to the term""Headhunter"". The job that Joe is involved with is matching the right people to the right job. Companies will call him and ask for a person with these qualifications and if the Headhunter finds the person then he get paid for his services by the company. If a person comes to him and gives him a resume then he tries to match them up with a company that needs that professional. In some cases he might approach people from company ""A"" and see if he can put together a package to work for company ""B"". If he can get a commitment from ""A"" he then  presents it to company ""B"" to see if they will agree and then he gets a brokers fee for putting together the deal. It is a job that takes lots of people skills, time and commitment. It is why this thread is so funny and tongue and cheek. Joe has in the past  has helped write quite a few resumes for people on the board and helped them  find new directions in their working life.  As you can see their is a big difference between an employment agency and the job that Joe does.   Art"
153202,Headhunter,2008-01-22 19:41:00,5703,"Ok... apparently I need to clarify some things here; - I have worked for an employment agency for the last 18 years! - I have manged teams of ""Headhunters"" for the past 12 years - I am relatively familiar with employment law! -my clients use me for many reasons, including staffing related concerns, industry trends, market analysis and some non-binding ""legal"" advice""  As to the comment, there are no good agencies... well, I won't defend an entire industry, but there are like any businesses, the good and the bad. The best advice I can give anyone searching for a new/better job, is to ask yourself this question: If you were in a job interview and the interviewer asked you what you did for your current/former employer that made you stand out among your peers, how would you answer that question? If you can't, you need to re-evaluate what and how you do what you do! It's a global market and there are many folks who will beyond the call of duty for their employer... that's who you are competing with. Tony is absolutely correct... you must continue to grow yourself or the world will pass you by! They pay $8.00 /hr to folks who have been passed by! HH"
152834,Headhunter,2008-01-21 20:50:00,5703,"Sorry to read about your pain Charlied... what ever you do, don't lose that work ethic... I know it doesn't seem like it right now, but it will serve you very well throughout your working career. Keep positive and the right opportunity will present itself. HH PS... I just got a subliminal message from Elvis... something about peanut butter and a tiller... no my mistake, he meant CONSOLE! HH"
152839,Roy,2008-01-21 21:11:00,13728," Truer words are seldom spoken....Hang in there CharlieD   UMMMM Elvis, eh? Fits behind a console eh?"
152850,Joey,2008-01-21 21:28:00,9122,"Honestly Joe, how rude of you to give off bad vibes in the workplace.  I think it is you that should be reprimanded.  Smarten up and start giving off happy vibes and if by the end of the month he is not on time, I think that then you should quit and tell him that you obviously are not a worthy enough boss  Joey"
152881,irishfield,2008-01-21 23:03:00,26272,Hey Joe...get back to work or I'm gonna call your boss and invite him fishing!  This guy comes in late...but hopefully he doesn't spend his day browsing the internet! LOL
152883,Terry,2008-01-21 23:07:00,14456,yeah. late and on the internet..fire him for sure.........
152896,pikehunter,2008-01-21 23:45:00,1659,"Bernie stated it well. By the sounds of things he isn't on a time clock, maybe that would make a big difference.  If he does his job (or above and beyond,) gets along well, is otherwise dependable, contributes, has a good nature and otherwise is an OK guy then don't let him get to you as this is what he is looking for. Probably just his way of showing that his superiors are not in complete control of him.  Frustrating? Yes. But if all the pluses add up then don't sweat it. Just grab your fishing pole   and seize the day!"
152901,Cast-Away,2008-01-21 23:54:00,790,"I like the suggestion about changing his hours so that he starts and finishes later since he doesn't seem to be able to make it in for his assigned time you are accomodating his travel schedule! See what he thinks of that.  If it doesn't work, then speak to HR to find out how they want it handled since the employee is giving you no respect. They should know how to deal with his kind. But you really should take some initiative yourself first before approaching them."
152929,Dano,2008-01-22 01:02:00,719,Kick him in the stones Joe...
152930,holdfast,2008-01-22 01:04:00,1813,"Here's what you do. Call him in your office.  You are standing behind your desk and you Ream him out on his dress and deportment.   If he attempts to say something you tell him to shut up as you do not want to hear Idle excuses especially from an Individualist.  Then you tell him that he is getting paid to be on time and at the present time he is a waste of Rations and a waste of tax payers money.  At that time you have him sign a document that he UNDERSTANDSif he is late one more time severe corrective action will be taken which could lead to possible Release.  In the mean time he does 8 weekend duties.  Ensure you tell your Supervisor what you are doing because that individual will be stepping up for his eventual Release.  Boy did I LOVE the ARMY.  We knew how to deal with Malingerers.  Here's an Army story.  A Medic attached to us decided he was special and did not have to do Guard Duty.  His excuse was....Its against the GENEVA CONVENTION to carry a weapon so consequently he was unable and it was illegal for him to do his part and secure our area of responsibility.  It is true that Medical people carry this Card.  I guess to protect them.  Well I said OK, go see the Sgt Major and tell him what you told me.  Well now, I heard this yelling, and Mr. I don't do Guard duty, was in a trench for 3 days straight.  I love it when your supervisor has you back.  Now for Reality, the recent Army as human rights infiltrated the Corps.  I caught one of my guys Lying to me when he destroyed a piece of Equipment by being Lazy and taking a short cut.  Because he knew I was investigating, he decided to accuse me of Harassment in the form of Abuse of Authority.  His memo went to the highest command in the Unit then down the ladder before I found out and could explain his accusations. So begins the investigation, all my Supervisors washed their hands and stated that they could not interfere, which I thought was SPINELESS.  Three months later I was found innocent by doing my job.  Afterwards I asked my Supervisor, NOW can I charge SO and SO for Destruction of DND property.  His reply was... NO because it will really look like you are harassing him. I SHAKE MY HEAD ON HOW WEAK THE SYSTEM IS getting to be.  Moral of the story.  Document, Document, and have him sign that he understands the consequences, if his problem carrys on.  OH YA, before you get to this point, because its a new era, Have a Touchy, Touchy, Feely, Feely, Father and Son Talk with that idividual.  Ensure you have a witness."
152946,Joey,2008-01-22 01:41:00,9122,"Is he busy enough?  Does he have lots to do when he gets there?  Sometimes you need something to look forward to when you get there instead of twiddling your thumbs.  If he's busy, then he's just testing you and pushing his limits if you ask me.  The more he gets away with, the more he'll try for more.  Joey"
152954,Daplumma,2008-01-22 02:00:00,1961,I second this statement. Joe
