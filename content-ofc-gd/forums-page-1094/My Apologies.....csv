Thanks god Monique is here to take the brunt of it.   I am working on a couple of cool contests for every one, Xtreme Anglers gonna have another good one coming soon.  It was all I could do to get the newsletter out, even two weeks late...  I saw a thread directed to me that came and went with out me seeing it...  I promise to try and check in a bit more."
