152497,huntervasili,2008-01-20 19:57:00,1604,This weekend has been a bad one it seems for accidents. I saw one near the 427 and 401 E yesterday where they had to turn around traffic because the whole road was closed and saw 4 more accidents throughtout the day on my way to and from Simcoe...
152498,Clampet,2008-01-20 19:57:00,1947,"I was thinking of heading up that way earlier today, boy am I glad I changed my mind!"
152500,misfish,2008-01-20 20:07:00,29133,"Just got a call from the oldest boy,HE,S IN THE TRAFFIC.Guess he,ll be late for his jig,s dinner."
152501,Dondorfish,2008-01-20 20:10:00,1000,Far better to arrive late and unharmed then . . . . . . . . .   Don
152503,Clampet,2008-01-20 20:15:00,1947,"Har Lads, no Salt Beef?"
152505,misfish,2008-01-20 20:18:00,29133," Salt beef, cabbage, taters, carrots and turnip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,oh and a nice roasted chicken and GRAVEY."
152508,Clampet,2008-01-20 20:24:00,1947," Awesome! Me better half's from the Rock, ya know. Twillingate / Crow Head."
152510,Dondorfish,2008-01-20 20:31:00,1000,They are saying now that its up to over 200 cars and also some serious injuries - PLEASE be safe and cautious if your in the area!    Don
152513,lew,2008-01-20 20:40:00,12767,"The 400 is a scary place when the whiteouts start.  If you keep driving you hit the guy in front, if you slow down you get nailed from behind.  Hope the injuries aren't too serious."
152515,misfish,2008-01-20 20:49:00,29133,Maybe I should put a sign out in front of the condo.This is the only time we get all this traffic. Jigs dinner for 10 bucks.LOL  
152519,Roy,2008-01-20 20:58:00,13728,"With cod tongues, $35.00  I agree Lew. Not much you can do when you get caught in something like that. Just hope for an exit I guess. Like you say, hope the final tally will only bring minor injuries."
152536,misfish,2008-01-20 21:43:00,29133,"All are home safe and eat,n away. Hope others get to do the same aswell.  "
152539,Gerritt,2008-01-20 21:55:00,6129,LOL.. I love the football commentary in the background!  Now that boiled dinner looks awesome!  G
152547,douG,2008-01-20 22:11:00,2693,"Jig's Dinner?  That's some fine eatin' there, Brian.  That is the favourite meal on the Algonquin trips fer sure.  We start that one right after lunch, simmering and  changing the water, chopping the vegetables and etc. Those cheesy biscuits (gallettes?) look good too.  Don't cut the vegetables too small, that's for sure, and don't forget the onions.  Glad to hear that the whole fam dambly is home safe and sound, and tucking in to a great satisfying meal.  Some pickled herring and onions go nice with a beer before dinner, just to set everything up."
152551,Gerritt,2008-01-20 22:15:00,6129,awww man!.... and all I am having is lousy spaghetti... I want some salt beef!  G

It can be scary when you get into a whiteout.  My friends son had his 7th Bday party at his grandparents in Barrie today.  Only my friend, her husband and two boys, her parents and myself made it...her sister and brother turned around when they found out what a mess it was up north....kids had fun anyway  I've driven through at least three squalls in the last two days...hope it's not as bad tomorrow, supposed to take my friend to Uxbridge to look at a horse in the morning... boy am i glad I got a snowblower  Maureen"
