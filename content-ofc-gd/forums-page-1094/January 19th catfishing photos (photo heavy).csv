152862,aplumma,2008-01-21 22:15:00,6896,"Nelly from what I know of the species they do not have any viable populations above South Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania. The cousin of this fish is the Channel Catfish which does tolerate colder waters and can be found along the Canadian border in waters that are not to far north. The size of the Channel catfish is not as big as the blues are.  Art"
