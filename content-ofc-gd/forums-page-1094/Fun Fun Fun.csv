152646,cork soaker,2008-01-21 05:09:00,23,"Last year i took son fishing, try load atv, portable hut, snacks gear etc, get to lake, unload atv, snacks, portable hut, hook up and get ready to go, then watch the fruit of my loins go up to his crotch in a partially frozen drainage ditch, where he happily decided to play, soaking snowpants boots etc.  he enjoyed watching me load everything back up again as we turned around for home. at least you got fishing, this year my boy knows not to play near the drainage ditches."

Instead l became a Elf for Moe. Glad l helped.  For the people that have not gone to the Fishing For Tyler l would like to tell you its a blast... Meeting people from the board and seeing a face to the name.  I am Glad that everything worked out and everyone is safe. You did have close time with Boooo and she knows that Dad will drop what ever he is doing to help his child.  Peace Ken

152692,ccmtcanada,2008-01-21 14:35:00,7971,"Wow...stories like this aren't helping convince me to start ice fishing...LOL.  Glad to hear she was safe and although the ride home was a long one, you fared much better than those 100 or so cars that were in that pileup."
