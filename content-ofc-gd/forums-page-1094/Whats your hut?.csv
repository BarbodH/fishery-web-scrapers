152640,Mike the Pike,2008-01-21 04:27:00,3421,Here is my Winter protection.           Oh and my hut comes with this Mascot he puts on your minnows and cleans all the fish
152728,Beans,2008-01-21 15:51:00,3339,I made a couple of wind shelters a few years ago and they worked quite well...     Only problem was that I used 3/4 inch plywood (too heavy to pull in the snow)...Should of used 1/4 inch and should of used aluminum toboggans instead of skis on the bottom as they dig into the snow where tobaggans ride on top...  Riley used to love to run around on the ice then curl up on his blanket inside the shelter...  Today they do duty as shelving units out in the fishing area of my garage     The tarps are now used to cover my wood pile...
152452,huntervasili,2008-01-20 18:46:00,1604,"Hey all figured since we are often in the same areas as eachother fishing especially on the Ice it'd  be a neat way to meet each other, unexpectedly. So for those interested post a pic of your Hut or your Quad/sled or vehicle if you bring it on the ice on  here so we can identify each other on the Ice.  Here's mine It has an OFC Sticker on the front door so ya know for sure its me, If ya see it come on by and say hi...  "

Pull up.. drill holes...position sled and cutter on windward side and set up the Jed shelter. My back took a cold beating last year sitting on the sled seat with back to the wind.
