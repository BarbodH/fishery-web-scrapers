153226,CLofchik,2008-01-22 20:37:00,854,"Planning on taking a bike camping trip along N. shore of Superior this spring, and was wondering what a decent time for spring chrome would be.  Early or late May, or are there still some trout to be caught as late as June?  Planning to tent it and play it by ear, but some general nudges towards rivers to check out or camping spots would be appreciated too.  "

153247,irishfield,2008-01-22 21:15:00,26272,April / early May along Superior...better stud them tires!  Campgrounds won't be open yet either..but lots of crown land around.  Nice creek/river at Rabbit ------ P Park. I wanna say Rabbit Nose...but don't think that's it. I never got the chance to fish it though...

Theres a few other crown land spots about an hour north of the soo, let me know if this is an area youre gonna check out. As for time you've gotta be flexible due to varying weather. Ive had great days on easter weekend and great days the last weekend in may."
