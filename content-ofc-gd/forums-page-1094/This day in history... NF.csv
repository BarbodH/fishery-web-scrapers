152857,TennesseeGuy,2008-01-21 21:48:00,957,"Hi Helene, it's good to have you back in Canada."
152863,snag,2008-01-21 22:15:00,1932,Happy bdays all!
152340,Roy,2008-01-20 12:38:00,13728,"In 1961, President John F. Kennedy gave his memorable inaugural address that included the words, ""Ask not what your country can do for you.…""  But, most importantly for me, my son Jeff was born in 1967 and my daughter Hélène was born in 1982.  One of the best days of the year for me.....Happy Birthday Jeff. Happy Birthday Helene, I love you both.  Have a great day, peoples..."
152344,b2kptbo,2008-01-20 12:44:00,1505,"Good stuff Roy, 2 cakes or lots of candles, hope everyone has a great day..."
152346,Marc Thorpe,2008-01-20 12:46:00,621,Happy birthday to both kids Roy Trully a special day
152349,lew,2008-01-20 12:59:00,12767,"WOW, whada coincidence Roy, Happy Birthday to both Jeff & Helene !!"
152351,motv8tr,2008-01-20 13:03:00,2587,"Hope they have a great day, and I trust Jeff was nicer to Helene than my brother was to me when I arrived on his birthday  Maureen"
152354,Greencoachdog,2008-01-20 13:42:00,8163,Happy Birthday to your adult offspring Bubba Roy!!!
152355,HTHM,2008-01-20 13:56:00,4082,So.........is YOUR birthday 9 months ago?  Congrads on the happy occasion!
152358,Terry,2008-01-20 14:08:00,14456,that does make it a great day in history.....
152372,darsky,2008-01-20 15:01:00,586,"wow-both on the same day,what're the chances of that?"
152376,Dondorfish,2008-01-20 15:09:00,1000,  1 in 365 ?   Don
152377,Roy,2008-01-20 15:10:00,13728,1:365 Darren.   1:1 if they were twins.
152378,Roy,2008-01-20 15:11:00,13728,Posted at the same time Tracker...what are the chances of that?
152389,TennesseeGuy,2008-01-20 15:35:00,957,"Happy birthday Helene and Jeff.  I say the odds of this happening are shorter than 1 in 365.   It indicates that Roy's annual ""get lucky"" day was the same every year and he made ithe best of it during two of those years.  Check with Marc Thorpe to determine how moon phases contributed to both events."
152401,Spiel,2008-01-20 16:04:00,9065,....Well I'd say they are both very lucky to have you for a father Roy. Best wishes to the three of you.
152405,John,2008-01-20 16:11:00,2956,"Happy Birthday Helene, Happy Birthday Jeff. You are both lucky to have such a great Dad!"
152420,Jeff R,2008-01-20 17:10:00,94,"Congratulations Roy, and a Very Happy Birthday to the both of them..."
152424,Dano,2008-01-20 17:16:00,719,"No way, the odds are much higher than that .  Happy b-day to your offspring Roy! Thats one way to remember everyones special day, its all about timing eh Roy?"
152426,skeeter,2008-01-20 17:21:00,1907,WOW::::: A FISHING GOD AND A GREAT FATHER!!!!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO BOTH OF THEM.   Dann
