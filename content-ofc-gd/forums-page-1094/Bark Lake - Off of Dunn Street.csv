153085,fishindevil,2008-01-22 14:51:00,6254,"Be very careful,bark lake is a very big,big lakeand is vary unpredictable,with currents & lots of pressure cracks due to rising & falling water levels,there is lots of access points,but i would really recomend going with a reputable guide,and rent a hut then you will learn the areas and be safe...for going out your first time i would not do it alone,and do some homework,on the puter and get a lake map,and some info on what area you were thinking of fishing....like i said it can be way more dangerous than lake simcoe,i dont mean to scare you off,just aware...there are many smaller lakes around the area of barrys bay,that are alot more productive and alot safer and easier to find fish...good-luck"
