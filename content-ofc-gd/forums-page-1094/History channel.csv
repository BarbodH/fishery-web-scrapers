153304,Andrew,2008-01-22 23:13:00,54,"I was also a little dissapointed, as it looked like a good show.  However, I believe there are 2 different history channels I think there is the ""History Channel"" and there is ""History Television"" one being Canadian and one being American.  This show was obviously in the US.  This happened with another series they aired last year called Ice Road Truckers about truckers driving the ice roads up north.  I managed to get those off of a bit torrent site, so I would assume this one would be there also.  Andrew."

152302,danc,2008-01-20 04:16:00,4677,"How would that be considered history? It's a show about the future, no?? Still, it looks interesting."

152307,HTHM,2008-01-20 04:24:00,4082,"I love the line "" How would you survive?"" Duh! The caption reads population 0 (ZERO)!!! That means no survivors, right?"
152359,Gerritt,2008-01-20 14:22:00,6129,   Uhmmmmmm........ no?  G
152361,Greencoachdog,2008-01-20 14:29:00,8163,"I see no reason to watch it, there'll be nothing but Cockroaches and Ants left..."
152363,Roy,2008-01-20 14:34:00,13728,"What worries me is, who's manning the cameras!"
152364,lew,2008-01-20 14:39:00,12767,"With the way some of the worlds wackos are acting lately, it may not be too much longer till were ALL history anyways.....including the wackos."
152367,mufasa001,2008-01-20 14:49:00,37,History channel rocks!  Discovery channel too.  Thanks for the heads up.
152379,skeeter,2008-01-20 15:13:00,1907,"Hey Gerritt------ if i was wearing my jacket with the reflective stripes on it and standing beside Tracker, i bet you would remember..--lol we were at the G2G with every one else. "

152404,fishinfool,2008-01-20 16:10:00,366,"I'm on Rogers in  Pickering, can anyone tell me what the channel is supposed to be. I see a show called ""Rome"" on the History channel tomorrow at 9:00. Looked up and down the channels but couldn't seem to find it. Looks like a very interesting show though.  SS"
152516,skeeter,2008-01-20 20:53:00,1907,"  its called ""LIFE AFTER PEOPLE "" JAN 21ST @9 PM THATS ALL I CAN TELL YOU. HOPE IT HELPS.   Dann"
152594,John Bacon,2008-01-21 00:33:00,3277,"  I am on Rogers in Scarborough at Port Union Rd.  I get the History channel on 54, I would assume that it is the same number in Pickering.  It may also be available on another number in HD if you have a digital box."
152668,setomonkey,2008-01-21 12:44:00,872,"Sounds cool, I read a book a few months ago called The World Without Us, which is also about what the world would be like if we disappeared, e.g., how long before all the buildings crumble, what animal species would bounce back...  Mike"
152670,Roy,2008-01-21 12:52:00,13728,"Sounds like a good show though.  BTW, in that clip, the shot with the payphone off the hook was taken in Quebec. If you turn up the volume you can just hear the Walmart employee saying ""for service in French, press 9. Your call is important to us."""
152693,Greencoachdog,2008-01-21 14:39:00,8163, The Omega Man?
152700,OhioFisherman,2008-01-21 14:50:00,6623,"for service in French, press 9. Your call is important to us."" LOL Roy, come to the US we can probably fit you in at number 3? You might have to bid on the spot though?"
