152461,mufasa001,2008-01-20 18:53:00,37,Hope you don't get hurt riding that bandwagon.  Pat's and Pack in the Super Bowl!!
152467,charlesn,2008-01-20 18:56:00,551,"Brian,  I think the Patriots win very easily in another boring beat-down of a pretender.  The Chargers are my favorite AFC team thanks to LT but I can't see them hanging with NE in the cold.  Has any southern based team ever done real well up north in late January?  I hate the Pats, because they're too good year after year, but damn they are just so stacked.  Jacksonville played as good as they can play but with a few mistakes and that's a few more than you can have against the Pats.  Heck Moss did nothing and they still won easily.  I just don't see the Chargers playing perfect with Rivers and LT both a little gimpy.  I like the Packers this week.  In a few weeks, I just hope they can keep it within 2 scores for long enough to make it to the first pee break.  lol  I can't see them keeping it within 3 scores unless the Pats decide to throttle back.  Charles"
152486,misfish,2008-01-20 19:48:00,29133,"Charles,,,,,,  You may speak the truth about the NEP,but I  strongly believe ,they will be the upset team of the two games."
152487,nelly,2008-01-20 19:49:00,256,For $10.00 on Pro line if it is offer?  New England to win by more than 7 points over the Chargers easily.  Green Bay to win by more than 3 points over Giants. This one might be closer than you think!  Take the over on the Green Bay and NY Giant. I don't know the line?
152530,Gerritt,2008-01-20 21:35:00,6129,Well I have to agree with the others on this...  I will take the Pats and the Packers.... even though I despise the Packers...  G.
152533,cplummer,2008-01-20 21:42:00,165,go giants
152537,misfish,2008-01-20 21:45:00,29133," Hell,go Bills,but thats a sure ,when hell freezes over bet.  LOL"
152546,bassmaster4,2008-01-20 22:10:00,801,Packers and Patriots
152574,uglyfish,2008-01-20 23:11:00,981,GIANTS!
152576,misfish,2008-01-20 23:15:00,29133,NEP
152580,jediangler,2008-01-20 23:35:00,1923,Pats will rule. Probably won't even break a sweat.
152586,carp-starter,2008-01-21 00:11:00,253,"Oh boy, NFL football? I guess instead of a playoff game, it will be time for a    Of course, for the Super Bowl it will be time for more    carp-starter"
152617,nelly,2008-01-21 02:19:00,256,"Now, I am really courious. I was too lazy and would not have made it to the store on time.  What kind of odds would I have gotten or the return on a $10.00 pro-line ticket?  New England won with over 7 points. The game was alot closer than I thought.  I was writing off the over at the half time for the G Bay/Giant but it looks really good.  Now I just need G Bay to win by 4 or more and I would have won if I had a ticket (LOL)!!!"
152627,gone_fishin,2008-01-21 03:00:00,481,"Uh Oh!  OVERTIME!!!  I guess it doesn't really matter who wins, the Pats are gonna roll over whoever wins this game anyway"
152631,gone_fishin,2008-01-21 03:13:00,481,WOW!!! who woulda picked the Giants to make it the Superbowl?  Oh well!  LETS GO PATS!!!
152632,uglyfish,2008-01-21 03:35:00,981,"iI picked the Giants to go to the super bowl! and, i;m gonna pick them to win!"
