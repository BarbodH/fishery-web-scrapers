334476,JohnF,2009-04-24 21:13:00,3494,"So how do you get away with being so smarmy? If I did stuff like that my wife would assume I'd done something bad and I'd be suffering all kinds of grief. I made the mistake of giving her flowers recently and she's still questioning me. There's just no room for romance in our marriage. The only way I get decent treatment is by being a clod. ..... hmmm, .... okay. End of rant.  JF"
334490,misfish,2009-04-24 22:08:00,29133,"That would be a understatement TJ.  She is more like the love I have not realized I had,til 6 mounths ago.Yeah marrried 27 years, but heck,we were young and we all know ,that love can be blind.Dont get me wrong,there was that flame,it just turned into a bunson burner.The last 6 months have been,well,so FANTASTIC.  Like the pastor said today to us,we could be poster adults.Talking is the best medicin.   For those that dont know,we will be re-newing our vows Saturday afternoon.She has become more then a wife.She is my best friend,my lover and one that I can trust with my life.  Heck,you tell me a women that you can marry,then say ok hun,see later this afternoon ,after I go shoot a turkey.   Thats how John."
