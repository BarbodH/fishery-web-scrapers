332983,JeffBornFishin,2009-04-21 13:12:00,260,"Attended the FMZ 17 meeting last night.  Was a well organized and informative event.  I had some questions answered and a few myths dispelled.  Was great to see you again Bill (b2kptbo) and to finally meet Dutch (Darren) Ron and Michael Brown!  I want to thank the volunteers on the FMZ 17 council as well as the MNR staff who are only interested in bettering our FMZ and for putting in all this time and effort.  Dutch, thats a great post and I think you covered it all there  Now we patiently wait to hear the results from all this work."
333047,Michael_Brown,2009-04-21 15:19:00,411,"Thank You.  To the OFC people who made it out to the meeting last night in Peterborough.  I enjoyed meeting you and appreciated your questions and comments. It is nice to see people ""walk the walk"" and support something they believe in.  We had approx. 70 people at the meeting last night in Peterborough.  The MNR has received just over 600 completed surveys , so far.  Considering that with 1.4 million anglers in the province and zone 17 is one of the most popular angling destinations, we can do better.  Please take the time to complete a survey and help spread the word.  If you would like more information visit the website posted earlier in this thread or plan to attend one of the remaining information sessions."
333443,Michael_Brown,2009-04-22 14:30:00,411,"Hi Everyone;  Tonight's meeting is in Port Hope and I just received word that there will be FREE coffee and possibly COOKIES for those who attend, along with valuable information concerning the fishery resource.  Come out and have your opinion heard and show support for some progressive angling regulation proposals.  The facebook petition to have Ron Reyns give the opening presentation topless has been slow to change public opinion but come down and meet a dedicated angler member of the council who has been working hard to improve the fishery we all enjoy."
333488,Ron,2009-04-22 15:57:00,1683,"   Mike Mike Mike......  Please do not scare off the interested folks who wish to gain more information and give input on the resource we all enjoy.  For the record, I've been topless before and it ain't pretty!  "

333827,Ron,2009-04-23 02:48:00,1683,"Sorry for the late replies to everyone but it seems I just have too much stuff on my plate and trying to keep up on this thread unfortunately seemed to be on the second bottom of the list. (Work is on the very bottom of my list, or so it seems).  It was nice seeing JeffBornFishin, b2kptbo and Dutch. All of who I have met for the first time. Nice to know there are local guys on this board. If we get a few more guys from our area active on here, perhaps we can get a GTG in the Summer months on one of the lakes around Peterborough.  Well, one more meeting down and the last one to go. This is the closest meeting to the GTA coming up. Seems like lots of folks on here are in the Oshawa area. I hope to see some or all of you at the meeting. The meetings are informative and this gives you a chance to voice your opinions. I don't think there has been a meeting yet where one of the questions wasn't about enforcement. There is no clear answer as it is in the hands of a different level of the MNR, certainly this concern about enforcement will be brought forward to the proper level and glad to see it is of concern to many people. I think people seem to understand the reasoning of why the walleye regulations have to change for zone 17. It's hard to explain from behind the keyboard but in a nut shell, majority of people who fish catch one walleye in a days fishing and majority of those fish are over 18 inches in length. The majority of people who are showing up to these meetings are Resort Owners and seasoned anglers, the people who know how to catch fish and in numbers. Many thanks to the MNR staff for putting on such an informative presentation and also Mike Brown and Chris Giles.  Hopefully at the end of this process, we as the council can give you an updated ""play by play"" of what's going on.  Cheers, Ron..."

If the mnr takes my challenge Jimmy will be on the team.  Was very disappointed that the mnr added 70cm trophy and 200 possession after I did my survey and didn't mention that they adjusting as they go.  If you can set up a meeting with Kawratha Assessment we could talk about way that slot hurt Balsam. more than it help.  Rice recovered from a devastating crash without mnr help so I'm  not pro very restrictive measures.  Garnet
333970,Ron,2009-04-23 16:10:00,1683," Hi Garnet,  I thought that was you who signed up to this site. Nice to see you here. I hope we can see if something like joining forces with the netting surveys and creels would add to the research information in regards to the walleye population. As for adding the 70cm trophy on the harvest slot, it has always been in the survey. Same goes for the 200 possession limit on panfish.  Cheers, Ron..."

320814,Ron,2009-03-23 17:59:00,1683,"Hey guys,  Thanks so much for filling out the survey. There are more people who can fill it out still. We have until May 19th but who would want to leave it for the last minute. If you answer the survey now, this will ensure our voice as anglers are heard. Trust me, there are different opinions on how the regs should be proposed. I for one would like to see the Kawarthas open for icefishing - pan fish only. The thoughts of taking my grand kids someday (better not be in the near future). for a 15 minute drive as opposed to driving for 2 hours to get them on to some quality Perch fishing."
320819,Ron,2009-03-23 18:26:00,1683," Hey Cliff,  There are various programs people can get involved in. I know of a few off hand. There is the Ganaraska fish lift is one and it may be a little too late to get on the volunteer list for the walleye spawning study. This walleye spawning study will be taking place at various dams (locks) and taking count of walleye in the spawning areas.  For anyone wishing to volunteer for various projects, please contact:  Peterborough Office: [email protected]  Aurora District: (905) 713-7400  Bancroft District (613) 332-3940  Let them know you would be interested in volunteering with some of the interesting programs.

I liked some ideas on slots and possession limits they had. Wish there was somthing more on protecting brookies tho. Next survey maybe lol.  -Dave
321990,Ron,2009-03-26 00:17:00,1683,"I hope they call you Cliff. I will be putting up a post for the upcoming Fish lift at Pratts Pond here in Cobourg. It's only a one day event but how often do you get a chance to handle a dozen or more Rainbows in one day. Last year we had approximately 40 volunteers and lifted 120+- rainbow over the dam. This should be happening in the next few weeks.  Dave, nice to know your opinion on the survey. Lets us know from our mistakes on what we missed or should I say overlooked. The only concerns to date that I know of are the missing field for question 1. There should have been a field to manually type in a lake name. The other concern I have heard was that there should have been a field about minimum size limit for muskie.   Cheers, Ron..."

332164,Ron,2009-04-20 00:36:00,1683,"Just a reminder for anyone in the Peterborough area that there is a public meeting Monday night at 7PM. The more anglers that attend the better. This is your chance to have input on the proposed fishing regulations.  Hope to see you there.  Cheers, Ron..."
332440,fluffmaster,2009-04-20 13:20:00,5,"Grimace you are so correct. Ron I do agree that some people will poach regardless of what is done BUT if the season stays the same, with the panfish season currently opening on the 4th Saturday in April at least the walleye will get a chance to spawn (as they ususally spawn in early April and not after the 4th Sat.) The current closed winter season protects the walleye as it is now. In my opinion it is harder to conceal yourself poaching fish,( therefore easier to enforce??), if you are the only one fishing during the closed season.  Wouldn't it seem that it is easier to poach fish if you have the legal right to be there in the first place. More ice fishermen simply means more poached walleye, bass, musky taken through the ice.  The MNR stated that the current prohibited winter fishing was enacted to protect walleye - Now they say walleye populations are in trouble in the Kawarthas but lets open up the ice fishing for panfsih. That does not make sense to me.  Walleye spawn alot along the shores of our lakes. There will be no protection here at all if this changes (as there is in the sanctuarys) This proposed new reg will allow someone to stand on a shoreline where walleye spawn, fishing for panfish, when they are really after walleye. If it is legal to be there then no one is going to call the MNR about someone fishing in an open season??  Also there will be abandoned /sunken ice huts to deal with, garbage on our lakes  and not enough C.O.s to patrol them..  Lets keep it as is and thats what my survey says."
332463,Stoty,2009-04-20 13:49:00,2910,"Done and done.  I would love a winter season, thats for sure.  Im just worried that certain groups of people will poach even more if they extend the seasons though.  I dont get why people cant follow the rules.  I'm glad they are starting to look at limiting sunfish. I'm sick of seeing ""white buckets"" FULL. There's no need for that."
332484,JeffBornFishin,2009-04-20 14:18:00,260, I will be attending tonight.  I am trying to get more people interested...got one pro tournament guy attending that I work with.  See you there.
332522,Michael_Brown,2009-04-20 15:27:00,411,"Hi Everyone:  Just getting ready for tonights meeting in Peterborough at the Navel Assoc. building across from Lock 19. We are hoping for a big attendance from the anglers with lots of positive questions and information regarding the proposed changes.  Just to respond to a few comments on poaching concerns, to restict angling opportunities to 99% of the angling community due to fear of a few criminal poachers is the real problem. This zone is the only zone in Ontario were you cannot enjoy quality time ice fishing with your family and friends. Not to mention the loss of tourism based revenue to our resorts, hotels, tackle stores, gas stations, etc. by not allowing winter angling. Just look at the industry surrounding the Lake Simcoe winter fishery for an idea how much the local economy could benefit from this. In slow times this is a good news story. I'm surprised the townships and business communities are not beating down the MNR door pushing this through. Angling is a huge industry in this zone, it is proposed to increase access to the anglers to year round instead of  7 months. That extra 5 months of business could mean millions of dollars into the local economy.  Also winter anglers would be harvesting adult panfish which directly prey/compete with walleye. The walleye only stand to benefit from this. Remember that most walleye in the lakes are 2 inches long not 24.  The rest of the province enjoys winter angling opportunities, why should we be different?  This is just my opinion, please take the time to complete a survey and provide yours."
332600,Ron,2009-04-20 18:49:00,1683,"  Hi fluffmaster,  Welcome to the board by the way, I'm sure you will find the information on this forum very usefull. This is one of the few full coloured boards where you can discuss anything be it from fishing to how to repair the input shaft on your lawnmower. (I think that is why this site is so successful)   Nice to see that we agree on some issues, debate is always good. As I have said before, (hope I don't sound like a broken record), regardless poaching is poaching. As for the walleye being finished spawning by the 4th Saturday in April, I would find that hard to believe. Last year for an example we caught a couple of walleye in one of our hot spots for Crappie. Both one male and 2 females were ripe and needless to say, we moved off that spot to leave the walleye to carry on with their business. This was on the North Shore of Rice Lake, exact area I won't disclose.  Surprisingly, some of zone 17 does have ice fishing, Lake Scugog for an example has a fantastic fishery for walleye and now Crappie through the ice. You very seldom hear of broken fishing regulations. In fact this year the CO that covers this area spent a great deal of time checking for infractions. I'm sure I can find the amount of charges laid and chances are they will be very minimal.  As for Ice fishing on the Kawartha's for Pan fish, just think of the opportunities to get new people interested in the Sport. I could only wish I was able to get my daughter ice fishing close to home at a young age. As it was, I would get her interested by driving for a couple hours only for her to loose interest after fishing for a half hour and then load everything up and do the 2 hour drive back home. She lost interest in ice fishing quickly at an early age. It took a few good years for her to get an interest back in the sport of ice fishing, something I hope I will be able to get my grand kids interested some day. After all they will be our future fisher kids keeping our heritage alive.  Surprisingly, the local CO in our area is looking forward to the opportunity on ice fishing in this area. He doesn't feel controlling the regulations would be difficult. By opening up the season on Pan fish in the Kawarthas, this will help the walleye population more so than be detrimental to them in 2 ways.  1 - The harvest of Pan fish will decrease the bio mass, meaning this will give the walleye more space. Regardless of which lake, it can only sustain a total weight of fish. If you remove 100 pounds of Pan fish this will in turn give the other species a chance to fill the void.  2 - By harvesting Pan fish, be it Crappies or Bluegill, Pumkinseed, this will in turn decrease the chances of predation on walleye fry.   The unfortunate part of ice fishing is the thought of all the garbage being left behind. Yes it does seem to be an issue. I guess it's a good thing that garbage doesn't float in the Summer. I would be afraid to see the bottom of the Lake from all the garbage that is tossed over board in the Summer months.  Just how often do you hear of ice huts being abandoned? Out of the amount of ice huts on lakes over all of Ontario, how many huts are left behind? 1?, 10? I have only heard of the one which was posted on this forum this week. In the same token, I also heard of a few docks which were a float in the lake which had broke free from either a resort or someone's private property, too bad there isn't numbers on docks so they can be tracked back to the rightful owners.  If you are in the Peterborough area, please attend the meeting tonight, your input and concerns would be welcomed in a public debate. Not only are we looking for people who fish, we are looking for all stake holders to attend. If you can't make it to tonights meeting, there are others coming up. I believe the list of meetings is posted above.   Cheers, Ron..."
332603,Ron,2009-04-20 18:54:00,1683,  Just thought I would bring the meeting schedule forward as well.
332613,Garnet,2009-04-20 19:10:00,2056,Hi Ron  Was going to Peter burge until this weather.  Port Hope is that the Masonic Lodge.  And you know I lived around Oshawa for 50 years were is O' Neil  Garnet

I might even hit the one in oshawa too....just for kicks.  A buddy of mine was at the one in Coboconk and said there was a great turn out, and lots of good information exchanged.  Sinker"
332809,fluffmaster,2009-04-21 00:46:00,5,"Ron - we agree to disagree for the most part. Poaching is poaching but allowing people to ice fish for panfish is going to allow for more poaching. You are going to put their hand in the cookie jar.  It is impossible to say all walleye are done by end of April as water temperatures/levels have a big role in this. They are all but done at the Talbot. And on Scugog you can ice fish walleye, therefore  your C.O. won;t be laying out of season walleye charges anyway. I would guess that he laid lots of charges out there for the little time he was out. He laid numerous ice hut charges I know for sure.  The CO here in Port perry just charged  a couple of guys for 13 walleye out of season in an area where MNR wants to open for panfish. This is where I have the problem. Fishing during a critical period like late March and April is a no vote for me.  Thanks - perhaps they will, at the most, only open it for Jan. and Feb. like Scugog."
332867,Dutch,2009-04-21 02:19:00,831,"Just got back from the Peterborough information session and I must say it was very well done.  Some facts (I think I am remembering correctly):  Rice Lake is the 3rd most fished Lake in all of Ontario, second to Lake of the Woods and Lac Seul, which are huge in size in comparison. Almost a third of anglers in that fished in Ontario are ""Non-resident."" The fishing industry in Ontario is worth $2.5 Billion a year. All money from licences goes directly back to the MNR. Fisheries Management is separate and distinct from Fisheries Enforcement - I had always though they could be looked at in conjunction, but my opinion has changed somewhat on that.  My take on the presentation:  We need to protect and develop a sustainable walleye management plan to ensure angling opportunities are around for our children and their children. Regulations are required for panfish to ensure continued angling success. A winter panfishing season may be a welcome change. I don't think an ice fishing season will increase poaching - poachers are law breakers and will do what they do regardless of an open season for a different species.  I really think I could have answered the survey better had I been to the presentation and then answered the questions.  I highly reccommend that everybody attend.  Surely some great information.  Separate and apart from the presentation - I fully support a single tier fishing license fee.  All money raised from licenses goes directly back to the MNR and stays in the Ministry.  We can only hope that leads to further enhancements in management and ENFORCEMENT, which should lead to a very strong fishery for many years to come.  We need to make an example of poachers in order to deter other law breakers.  I'm going to write/e-mail my MPP and the Minister of Natural Resources about that.  As far as other OFC'ers that were there, some I met for the first time tonight - b2kptbo, always a pleasure.  Jeffbornfishing, Ron and Michael Brown nice meeting you!  Hope to see you all on the water!  Thanks again Ron and Mike for serving on the advisory committee - it is a very beneficial cause and I hope your service will bring all of us more and better fishing opportunities in the future."

Not sure how the underfunded MNR is going to enforce the closed walleye season while all this crappie fishing is going on.   I hope the extended seasons provide more fishing opportunities without hurting the walleye.
318614,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-17 22:44:00,260,Survey completed.  Thank you Ron for your help in this matter.  I feel we need to move forward with Zone 17 and stop some of the ongoing ABUSE of our resources here.  I also really appreciate how we are able to give specifics in the questionaire!

318624,bigugli,2009-03-17 23:05:00,6138,"I have my doubts about a limited species winter season. MNR lacks the manpower already for adequate enforcemen, and I doubt they are going on a hiring spree."

318644,Ron,2009-03-17 23:36:00,1683,"   Thanks Grimace,  AS for poaching walleye in those extended seasons, it's no different than now. There will be people regardless who poach. If this was a concern (perhaps the wrong choice of words as it is a concern). They would only have one season opener for all species of fish. Pan fish would no longer open the 4th Saturday in April because people would be out fishing for walleye and bass at that time of year as well.  The most important message to come out of this is to ensure the regulations aren't made or changed because of illegal actions a very few commit.  I hope this helps."

318760,tinbanger,2009-03-18 03:09:00,1028,Done. Sleepy now reading all that info  Thannks Ron for all your efforts.  TB
318763,musky66,2009-03-18 03:31:00,273,"Completed survey- very good, but now I have to consider keeping the boat out of storage a month longer! Not a fan of Bass fishermen, but I voted to keep them out longer too- nice to have company on the lake so late in the year."
319088,Ron,2009-03-19 02:35:00,1683,"  Here ya go Cliff,  The intent of that question is to gauge the relative experience of the angler, unfortunately there are 50 or so lakes in FMZ 17 and it would make it too complicated to name all the lakes. Hind site there should have been a field named ""other lake"" where a person like yourself could have filled in the name of the lake. I hope this answers your question Cliff.  So come on guys, what are you waiting for? Participate and let them know what your thoughts are.  Cheers, Ron..."
