This is fine, except the only thing I can think of that would work well for it is bobber stops, which I don't currently have.  Anyone have any suggestions? Thanks in advance."

334715,Twocoda,2009-04-25 21:02:00,4130,double sided barrel is what i use and have never been broken off at the knot before ...but if your worried about it ...you can do the improved clinch double sided ( same as the barrel but the tail comes back up into the top loop ) ive lost too many fish trusting the courtland shrink wrap so i dont ever bother with it anymore something about heating up a fishing line doesnt make sence to me
334726,muddler,2009-04-25 21:44:00,623,"I use two methods to connect my leader to the fly line.  1. For floating lines I splice in the leader using a needle knot into the fly line. As the leader gets cut back by adding or subtracting tippet material, I'll just splice a new leader to the last 3 ft or so of the original leader.  Eventually after a couple seasons the butt of the oriiginal leader will get too short to splice a new leader. I just cut off the last 1/2 inch of fly line and repeat the proceedure.  2. For sink tip and sinking line I make a small loop by folding back the fly line and using fly tying thread make a neat small wrap over the doubled line. Flexi cement the wrap and I'm done. I use sinking leaders that have a factory loop  and use a loop to loop connection.  Very easy to change leaders and configurations that way.   muddler"
