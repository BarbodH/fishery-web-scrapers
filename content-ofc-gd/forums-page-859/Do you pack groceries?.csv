334906,solopaddler,2009-04-26 12:18:00,8605,I'm one of the few it seems who shop at home before leaving.  There's a couple of factors though. What if there's nothing to shop at when you reach your destination? (That's almost always the case with me).  If I didn't shop at home that would entail stopping enroute. That wouldn't work for 2 reasons. First I always leave uber early so anything half decent is usually closed when I'm driving by. Second it's a moot point anyway 'cause I only stop for gas that's it. I'm waaay more interested in getting to where I'm going as quick as possible. No interest whatsoever in stopping and walking around a grocery store. I've got enough time for that at home.
334916,Fisherman,2009-04-26 12:52:00,7201,"No solo, you aren't the only one, I do the majority of the shopping local because the store's open 24/7 and, I figure it's better to have the items you want with you, rather than not being able to find or get them en route or at your destination."
334973,POLLIWOGG,2009-04-26 15:07:00,835,"Used to go north for a bike trip, its a hoot to watch a bunch of bikers grocery shopping, they'll ride without a helmet but won't eat white bread or butter.  If we didn't have a truck with us we would ride light as long as we could and load up at the last spot. We were on holiday and stopped to talk to everybody, it didn't take long for the locals to remember us from last year."
334616,Radnine,2009-04-25 12:15:00,1538,"This morning was the first morning nice enough to sit out on the back porch with your coffee. So as Jen and I are sipping (and she starts listing what needs to be done outside) I brought up our upcoming trip to Cameron Lake in July. The following topic came up and I immediately saw an opportunity for a post: Do you haul groceries north, or do you shop when you get there? In the case of Cameron Lake, there is a beautiful big grocery store in Fenlon Falls, less than ten minutes from the cottage. And I am thinking that the notion of packing food in coolers, getting ice, filling every inch of the van and boat, worrying about crushing the potato chips, etc. is an antiquated way of doing things. Jennifer's argument is that she wants to vacation the minute she gets there and not have to unpack then go shopping. Should I dump her, or do you guys still pack like prospectors? And does the porch really need painting? Jim"
334618,solopaddler,2009-04-25 12:24:00,8605,I always pack before I leave. Usually the quality of meat and vegetables just isn't the same up north.
334619,richyb,2009-04-25 12:34:00,774,Nah the porch should be fine for another year
334620,BUSTER,2009-04-25 12:34:00,1336,"a cow is a cow meat is meat.  my wife says she finds it much cheaper to fill the cooler with stuff when we get there, we drive 4.5,5hrs one way to sudbury area. at that time i get some beer and ice, and she hits the little stores in chelmsford ,besides my wife likes shopping , so stopping at a new store even so she can peek in is somehow exciting to her??  i dont get it. now go paint the porch!"
334621,fishing n autograph,2009-04-25 12:40:00,2540,"yeah, normally when I go away camping or to a cottage, unless we are a couple hours from no where, we usually shop when we get there. More space to pack stuff!"
334624,Peps,2009-04-25 13:21:00,191,"I always shop before hand, for the big stuff, but I also leave a little shopping to be done when we get to our destination (support the local economy)  Peps"
334629,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-25 13:50:00,10439,"I shop before I leave, you have to when you live at the end of the road.  Even when I'm heading south on vacation I need to load up before I head out. If I'm heading to Alaska my next good place to shop is a long two day drive in Whitehorse."
334637,Greencoachdog,2009-04-25 14:43:00,8163,"You should be painting the porch... yesterday!!!  Shopping for groceries after you get there has always been part of the trip fun for me. You can find ""different"" stuff and try out the local brands!  I wait 'til my destination has been reached and everything has been unloaded from the truck, and then pop out to the local grocery. I also like to do souvenier shopping in local tackle shops for ""different"" tackle, T-shirts, and ball caps!  ... but I'm sure you'll do what your wife tells you to do."
334638,shane,2009-04-25 14:47:00,652,Do what you're told.    And make sure you're smiling when you eat your crushed potato chips.
334640,irishfield,2009-04-25 14:52:00,26272,We always try to buy when we hit town... if you don't the store might not be there the next time when you really need it for mix !  ..and you'd be surprised at the meat cuts in there solo... walk over next time you're hitting the Temagami LCBO ! lol
334650,Joey,2009-04-25 16:49:00,9122,"I prefer to buy and pack before I leave.  Paul straps the cooler on the back of the truck so it would be a pain to unstrap it and fill it en route.  I'd also find it a pain to get all set up at cottage or camp and then have to go and get groceries.  I agree with the wife, I want my vacation to start when I get there.  I think you need a new porch, not just paint  Joey"
334653,gdelongchamp,2009-04-25 16:59:00,199,"When we go camping at a lodge or provincial park, I plan out the menu for the entire eight or nine days time we are there. Then we list out every single item we will require to finish every single meal to everyone's satisfaction. That includes the ingredeints for proper preparation of the appetizer of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for the trempettes with  toasted bread over the fire on evening #4 and the vanilla extract for the strawberries and fresh whipped cream for a breakfeast of waffles for breakfeast #6. This also means that we can't toss in the red pepper in a salad on day 3 if we require that red pepper as an ingredient for the chicken fajitas on day eight.  We purchase and pack everything locally before we leave and this usually requires two to three extra coolers full of  pre-rozen, pre mixed orange juice, fruit juice, and milk cartons for breakfeasts and snacks around the campfire. After a couple days I shift the frozen drink containers as required to other coolers to keep the temperatures in those coolers down. It reduces our packing of ice considerably. And it keeps the beer cold, the meats cool and the fresh fruits cold the way the youg ones like them.  We have to make sure the coolers all have proper locking lids to keep the raccoons out. As for bears, we don't worry about them much as the campgrounds are well populated.  We plan our meat meals later during our stay as some meats require more time to defrost than others. We monitor this carefully and may shift one planned meal to meal #4 instead of meal #9 to accomodate this.  Of course we will keep our coolers full of meat in the vehicles  as we do have respect for bears.  In the daytime when we are out of camp for most of the day we stack 2 or 3 coolers and cover them with sleeping bags and keep them in the shade.  We learned to camp this way from experience. I am sure other people have lots of good ideas and I would like to hear about them. Perhaps in a different thread."
334674,Dnthmn,2009-04-25 18:27:00,128,"My preference is to pack the meat we will have while away (when you buy in bulk it's hard to justify a steak from the grocery store rather than one of the 3 dozen in your freezer) and then hit the farm stands and such on the way for the fruit and veg. You can't beat fruits and veggies that were picked and then walkedd 100 yards to the roadside stand. Heck, IMHO that's half the reason I like getting out of town so much!"
334675,Radnine,2009-04-25 18:29:00,1538," Congratulations, you have managed to make a vacation sound twice as difficult as staying at work. Jim"
334682,Fisherman,2009-04-25 18:42:00,7201,"Oh my god, what do you do when it comes to bedroom fun."
334684,Sinker,2009-04-25 18:43:00,8692,"All that work, when all you need is beer and whiskey........oh, and your rods/tackle.  If we're going to the cottage, we generally get most things up there. If its a camping trip, I like to have my stuff packed and ready to go when I arrive at my destination. Then its just a matter of dumping it off at the site,and launching the boat   Sinker"
334687,bigugli,2009-04-25 19:29:00,6138,"I guess it depends on whether there is a decent grocery enroute to wherever I'm going. If camping, the meat segment is planned and purchased ahead with a lot being already smoked or cured. After that its fish, fish, fish,...."
334716,Beans,2009-04-25 21:04:00,3339,Do the shopping by yourself when you get to your destination...that way you get what you like to eat...
334754,Moosebunk,2009-04-25 23:19:00,3970,Get it when I get there.  Or nearby.  Or catch it on the way.  Agreed Wayne... Temagami store has great meat.  Went in there the tuesday after family day.  Asked the butcher for a large tenderloin to cut my own steaks for the guys.  Had it... quick trim... dang fine on the BBQ that night.
334768,skeeter,2009-04-25 23:51:00,1907,"dont let GCD fool you, he picks up his food onroute. its called ROAD KILL !!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL and if the skins still intact he wears it as a hat!!!!   as for takin food with you so you can start your vacation as soon as you get there.......... do you say that before or as your setting up the tent, dining tent,coleman stove,propane tank, lantern,lawn chairs,filling up the air mattresses,unrolling the sleeping bags, unpacking the truck-------- or do you make paul do that joey?---lol see ya up at lake air"
334777,Fudd,2009-04-26 00:15:00,94,"As a rule i never pack any food or essentials except beer. I figure if i am going to an area to fish or hunt i may as well dump some cash on the local economy. I may take enough food for the first night, in case i am to lazy to go to the store right away but generally no."
334778,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-26 00:16:00,10439,  Don't forget the taters and beans to go with the fish.
334780,purekgw,2009-04-26 00:17:00,585,we usually try and hit a few rabbits or deer on the way up and thats the food for the week
334817,crappieperchhunter,2009-04-26 02:13:00,2582," We have taken that 1 step further. Experience has taught us that if you leave before sun up, you can get very fresh road kill before the crows start picking at it. Saves wear and tare on your car when someone else does the dirty work"
334854,HTHM,2009-04-26 03:46:00,4082,"Buy it when you're there. As for the new porch, I know a guy...."
