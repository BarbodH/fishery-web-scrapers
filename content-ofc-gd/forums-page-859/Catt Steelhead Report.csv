I picked up my friend Joe who lives in the Southern Tier, he fished the Catt earlier in the day and had a few spots that produced fish earlier.  Are first stop was on the reservation.  We both landed one silver fish.  The fish below came on a chartruese egg sack.  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...si&img=6958  At around 6 PM, we made a game time decision to hit the lower section.  Our bait of choice was an olive jig fly tipped with a wax worm.  Joe struck first with a nice jack.  Than we had a double header with me landing the fish below:  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...si&img=6959  As the winds began to calm down, I was able to be more precise with my drifts.  In the last hour of daylight we were able to get a steady pick of steelhead and bass:  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...si&img=6960  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...si&img=6961  My final tally for the night was 5 steelhead and 5 bass.  Joe landed 6 steelhead and 1 bass.  It was tough to leave since this may be my last outing of the Spring season.  Maybe if weather conditions permit, we can sneak out one more time.  Tom"
