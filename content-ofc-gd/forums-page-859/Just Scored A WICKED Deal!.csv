334369,Bassman27,2009-04-24 15:19:00,98,"Smokin deal,she's a beaut!!!!Congrats"
334373,drwxr,2009-04-24 15:29:00,453,"congrats on the deal, as of today  you became a real paddler"
334374,kennyman,2009-04-24 15:37:00,737,"That is a gorgeous canoe. It's way too ""purdy"" for my trips down the Grand etc. I'd have to save that for special occasions LOL."
334385,Cookslav,2009-04-24 16:11:00,1457,"Thats a beauty, And one heck of a deal! That model hits my weight requirements as well at 52lbs....I know as I did the research because I actualy saw that canoe while shopping, and scrolled by it based on the price tag, but boy did I drool on the screen a bit first  That will  serve you very well on your next adventure, she'll be a dream in the still waters. I just got a new to me"" ultra lite Fiberglass Scott and it weighs in at a lofty 50lb's but then again its ony 14', with aluminum trim, and not nearly as pretty to look at  I'm jealous....very jealous"
334438,JFR,2009-04-24 18:57:00,498,"Nice catch Mike.  I owned a Langford Prospector 16 ft a few years back.  Great tripping canoe, but once arthritis started setting into my knees, my tripping days  came to an end  :(  Enjoy your new ride  John"
334452,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-24 19:52:00,10439,  In that case he's going to HE!! for robbing that poor old couple!!!!  Nice boat Mike!!!! Where does the motor go?? ?? ??  
334457,douG,2009-04-24 20:15:00,2693,I think all the kindness Mike has shown members here over the years does indeed qualifiy this canoe transaction as karma.
334463,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-24 20:28:00,3761,"Nice ride man, you were right...excellent condition! Have fun."
334467,misfish,2009-04-24 20:35:00,29133, I totaly agree.Nice score.
334471,solopaddler,2009-04-24 20:58:00,8605,Enough guys.  But thanks for the kind words.  On a side note the kids like the new boat. They played in it all afternoon.  
334474,fishnsled,2009-04-24 21:06:00,3520,Nice looking ride Mike.  Enjoy the adventures and looking forward to the reports.  Looks like the family can hardly wait.
334478,Moosebunk,2009-04-24 21:22:00,3970,Perfect canoe Mike.  Gnarly pick-up.  Looking forward to the trip and fish reports you bring us from this ride.
334484,Greencoachdog,2009-04-24 21:40:00,8163,That thing'll fly with a 250 Merc strapped to the back of it!!!  Good looking vessel!!!
334489,lucabrasi,2009-04-24 22:00:00,114,"That is a sweet canoe. I like the Prospector design myself, best all around for fishing/tripping and a Langford to boot! Well, you can't beat that. Hey is that sliding seat a custom job?"
334491,solopaddler,2009-04-24 22:10:00,8605, Agreed on the prospector design. The sliding seat is standard (I think).
334550,Radnine,2009-04-25 01:04:00,1538,"Nice brother, congrats! Jim"
334592,Rizzo,2009-04-25 02:57:00,4754,"good for you and I'm sure they knew what it was worth, just wanted it gone! I know someone who did a 300,000 renovation to a cottage one summer, then levelled it the next year and built new! to some people money is no object and a 3000 canoe is less than a drop in the glass"
334292,solopaddler,2009-04-24 12:25:00,8605,"For a couple years now I've been forced to rent every time I did a canoe trip. Yeah I've got a 16' squareback Sportspal, but that's not really a canoe for tripping...  Anyhow, I've known what I've wanted for a while now but coming up with the 3 thousand bucks to buy it isn't easy.  Earlier this week I was checking Kijiji and someone locally was selling the exact canoe I've wanted for a while now. It was an older couple who had bought the craft 1 year ago and had used it ONCE. It's been stored indoors and doesn't have a scratch on it. I stopped by for a look and offered him a crazy lowball offer which amazingly he accepted.  So....I get a canoe that retails new for $3000 plus tax for $1000. (To get the $1000 bucks I managed to pawn off one of my float reels  )   Here it is, my new baby: 16.6 Langford Prospector Kevlar canoe with ash gunnels and cherrywood thwarts, beam and seats. It's got a sliding front seat and a kneeling pad with a contoured butt rest for soloing. Also in the deal were 2 Langford paddles worth at least $100 bucks each and full set of new tie down straps.  Sweeeet!! (Can you tell I'm stoked?)             I'm headed to Algonquin next week so the timing couldn't have been better!!"
334294,Stoty,2009-04-24 12:29:00,2910,"Wow, very nice pickup!  I'm looking to get a light-wight canoe as well for the summer. You selling your ""old"" one? lol"
334295,Fudd,2009-04-24 12:30:00,94,wow... all i can say is wow.... i am thinking about calling the cops cause that is theft for $1000 bucks.... congrats mate. I hope you catch many brookies and may your lines always be tight... wow
334296,Leecher,2009-04-24 12:30:00,7832,Beauty Mike.... That thing is mint  I'm sure you'll put it to good use..... congratulations Leechman
334298,trapshooter,2009-04-24 12:37:00,1234,NIIIICE boat Mike!!  We just talked about canoes last week.  Glad to see you found one... and in such great shape and loooow price!!
334300,Spiel,2009-04-24 12:40:00,9065,"Indeed an amazing score Mike and yes I can tell you're stoked. Congratulations, I know it'll see plenty of use."
334303,Beats,2009-04-24 12:48:00,543,Beauty boat.  Looks to be in perfect condition.  What a steal!
334304,bigugli,2009-04-24 12:49:00,6138,That is a beaut for sure. You got a steal.
334305,Jen,2009-04-24 12:50:00,833,"Awesome buy, wow... You will get many years of service out of that canoe, money well spent!  Cheers,  Jen"
334306,Nemo,2009-04-24 12:57:00,727,Nice deal. What does she weigh. Would be glad to hit APP with you. Let me know if you need a bowman for your next trip.
334307,BillM,2009-04-24 13:00:00,17367,Bring on the maiden voyage!!!!!  
334308,FLEX ROD,2009-04-24 13:02:00,394,"That is just plain and simple Mike, and it is called good Karma, good things happen to good people!  FLEX"
334313,troutologist,2009-04-24 13:05:00,951,"Wow, man am I jealous. I've been wanting that same boat. Rare to see any used ones up this way for sale. Good searching Mike!"
334315,NAC,2009-04-24 13:09:00,369,"Poor elderly folks never even saw you coming!  Great looking boat Mike! How about putting together an OFC trip?  Lots of paddlers on this board. Minden-Dorset area is prime for a trip right now....  as are many other areas, before the bug season starts."
334316,solopaddler,2009-04-24 13:14:00,8605," Thanks everyone, it really was a great deal.  Nemo at some point we'll have to get out together, I know you're into this kind of thing as well. Weight on the boat is 48lb's...very light and balances beautifully when carrying it.  The prospector is a fantastic design. It's a symetrical boat that's good for both flatwater and has enough rocker for whitewater. I paddled this exact craft a couple years ago and fell in love with it."
334319,kickingfrog,2009-04-24 13:18:00,8333,You're a real son of a gun! I HATE you!  That's the perfect colour as well.  Very nice.
334329,blaque,2009-04-24 13:39:00,2419, i was thinking the same thing lol
334331,highdrifter,2009-04-24 13:44:00,2534,"Holy, that's a steal and a half brotha!  Kijiji is awesome for that..  You gonna take break her in this weekend?!  That's a sexy flat water canoe mang....   Those built in knee pads are purty handy too.  WICKED!!"
334335,irishfield,2009-04-24 13:56:00,26272,Thief !
334340,kickingfrog,2009-04-24 14:06:00,8333, Maybe he would have taken $500?
334345,solopaddler,2009-04-24 14:15:00,8605," Don't think so.  The old boy wanted $1500 which was still a good deal, but I managed to talk him down.  I didn't steal it from him either, he knew exactly what he had there and what it was worth. He just didn't care, wanted it gone....."
334346,Zubris21,2009-04-24 14:15:00,563,"That is unreal!  I'll be in the market for something similar this summer.  I really like the pads for soloing.  Do you know anything/ have any thoughts on the integrated trim that Swift is offering on some of their high end boats?  Seems to me like theres a high likeliness to split and have water seep in, but I haven't seen them first hand to really say.  Great boat, and great deal, I hope you disturb a few ""glassy"" lakes on your way to those brookie holes."
334347,TJQ,2009-04-24 14:16:00,7806,Dude....  awesome deal.. on an AWESOME canoe!!  I was looking at that exact one a few years back...
334348,solopaddler,2009-04-24 14:20:00,8605," Interesting I don't know anything about the new integrated hulls on Swift boats, I'll have to check it out.  I previously have owned a 16' Swift Kipawa and a 17' Dumoine. Both fantastic boats but I shied away from another Swift as the service with those guys has always been brutal."
334367,ccmtcanada,2009-04-24 15:05:00,7971,Sweet canoe Mike!  Hopefully I'll have a chance at fishing out of it up north one day!!! hint hint...LOL.
