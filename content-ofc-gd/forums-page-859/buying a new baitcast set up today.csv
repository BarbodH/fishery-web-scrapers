334626,wolfmachine,2009-04-25 13:28:00,89,"Hey guise, i'm lookin into buying a nice baitcast type setup for walleye/pike  bass or whatever  been looking at either the shimano compre or crucial rods and either a citica or curado reel  as far as length and action of the rods, what do u think is best??  what type of line should i run on her? i'm thinking PP, but not sure what LB test  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...__SearchResults  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...__SearchResults  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...__SearchResults  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...__SearchResults    http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...__SearchResults  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...tems#itemDetail   i'm kind of leaning towards the compre and the citica reel. mostly because i fish for whatever, not necessarily musky specific.  plus its a little easier on the wallet."
334641,ohhenrygsr,2009-04-25 15:19:00,947,"Compre Rod with Curado Reel best combo, very light plus lifetime warranty on rod and the reel will work til you die"
334644,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-25 16:06:00,3761,"The Citica is a very good reel, my friend like's his very much, the Curado is better for throwing very light baits rather that the Citica but for 60 or so bucks less the Citica is a great buy. As for the rods, i hear the Compre rods are a great buy."
334652,wolfmachine,2009-04-25 16:59:00,89,should i just go compre instead of crucial?  what heaviness of rod should i get?
334666,ld17,2009-04-25 18:04:00,319,"go compre I have two and they are great.  I have both in MH power.  Which is great for pike and bass.  You may want a M power if you fish for walleye more.  The line depends on what your fishing, where your fishing, which type you use- braid, mono, fruoro?  Hard to say which line.  For bass and pike I would go with 15-20lbs braid.  If walleye you may want Fluoro in say 8-10lb test.  Hope this gives you some direction."
334667,mikeh,2009-04-25 18:06:00,824,"ANOTHER NICE ROD ARE THE sT CROIX mOJO RODS, i THINK THEY ARE THE SAME PRICE OR CHEAPER THAN THE COMPRE'S. As far as reels I started buying Daiwa's and find them to be great reels."
334727,wolfmachine,2009-04-25 21:45:00,89,"ended up buying wayy too much stuff today....haha  shimano medium heavy compre trigger rod  shimano citica low pro baitcaster reel with 15 lb braid  abu c4 reel with 65lb braid  some senko style baits, hooks, musky baits  hahaha  thanks guise, i can't wait to use this stuff"
334779,ld17,2009-04-26 00:16:00,319,your gonna love that rod and reel.  With the braid tick tick set the hook baby.  Looking forward to some posts with pics included.  Cheers and good fishing.  I picked up a c3 with 50lb power pro no muskie is safe!
334853,GoneFishin,2009-04-26 03:40:00,349, I with him! I love St.Croix rods and I started using Daiwa last year and there products are all made very well and are very user friendly which is great when your constantly having to adjust according to lure size and wind speed.
