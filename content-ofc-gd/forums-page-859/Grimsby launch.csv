334837,HTHM,2009-04-26 02:59:00,4082,Your map is correct. And so is Bigugli
334851,bigugli,2009-04-26 03:37:00,6138,"The offramp in Grimsby is for 3 cross streets:  Ontario st, Christie and Maple. You go through the first cross street and turn left at the second intersection."
335012,rockfish,2009-04-26 16:30:00,91,There is a free ramp at the end of Elizabeth st at the Forty mile park. It's gets fairly shallow in there at times so not good for large boats.
