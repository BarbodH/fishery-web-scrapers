334710,Joeytier,2009-04-25 20:52:00,3990,"I'll agree with the last pic, but I don't the issue with holding a smaller fish under the gill plate for a few seconds for a shot and then back in the water."

335003,tizfun,2009-04-26 16:02:00,292,"Yes it was a good day and I had released the smallest and the biggest one without any problems.. I understand it's not the correct way of holding a fish, but ( the big one ) I was on my own and trying set the timer on my camera and get a pic... He was in the water and swam away like a champ..
