334510,irishfield,2009-04-24 23:02:00,26272,"With all the boat strip and paint threads and the supposable ""need"" for special paints for below water I thought I'd look into what Lund paints their boats with. Much to my surprise... it's the exact same paint I have on my airplane for Lund boats prior to 2005. PPG Concept.. just a good single stage.. 2 part car paint. They are now using PPG... Delta or Delfleet, which is just the next generation of the Concept. No issues on mine after two full season sitting in the water from Early May to Late October. Bottom paint is flawless still.  So if anyone has scratches, etc... here are the paint codes. In the Midland area Dave Doherty at D&S Auto Body has the PPG mix rail in his paint booth.
