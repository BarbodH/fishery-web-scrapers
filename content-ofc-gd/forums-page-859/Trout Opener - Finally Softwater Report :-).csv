334563,Greencoachdog,2009-04-25 01:41:00,8163,"Excellent report and pics Jacques!!!  I'll be damned if I can see that Partridge though!!!  I love eating the smaller fish like that!!!... I scale them, cut off the heads, and gut them... then fry them up whole!!!  If you know the fishe's anatomy, you don't have to worry about the bones... especially with Trout!!!... the part I like the best is the fried tails!!! (I can make a meal out of fried fish tails... if there's enough of them!!!)  I hope you enjoyed your meal and I'm looking forward to more of your softwater reports!!!"
334567,Leecher,2009-04-25 01:46:00,7832," Thanks silverstreak!!! That partridge was on the road when I noticed it and she trickled into the side of the bush not in a hurry, was able to talk to her for a few seconds while I tried to grab he camera which was on the back seat of the car and take this shot of her"
334576,Leecher,2009-04-25 02:09:00,7832," Thanks Glen!!!   Click on the header of the pic to enlarge it and you will see in the middle just slightly to the right, the head and tail amongst the fallen tree  As for scaling specks, no need for that as they don't have any Before you cut off their heads off and gut them, start by inserting your knife into the rectum and follow all the way to head, then make an incision around the head and crack the bone, don't go through it.  You then snap the head inward to the belly with your two hands and pull the head all the way along the belly to the tail and will be left with your meal.  It's hard to explain for me but next time i get some, will post a video of how I do it. You know what,  the tail, once cooked, is like chip and is like a delicacy for me.  Mom and Dad use to cook them for us kids every sunday.  Tomorrow going to another lake and will be posting some sort of report hopefully Jacques"
334578,mbac31,2009-04-25 02:16:00,904,Man I still cant see that dam bird. Great specks as well.
334579,Cudz,2009-04-25 02:21:00,2652,Nice specks I just payed where's waldo with that bird for 10 minutes.  Finally found it.  It is close and big.  Amazing how well they camouflage.
334588,Leecher,2009-04-25 02:45:00,7832, Thanks smalliefisher!!!  Look right in the middle of the pic and slightly to the right amongst the twigs and dead tree you'll see the head and the tail   Thanks Cudz!!!  Yes it's amazing how they can camouflage them selves but the thing is I got that shot only after I was able to grab the camera from the back seat LOL  She wasn't in any hurry to disappear on me
334591,Cudz,2009-04-25 02:54:00,2652,Look Here 
334606,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-04-25 10:08:00,1362,Nice trout Jacques....  ....you seem to be sick on a lot of Fridays lately   ......
334609,b2kptbo,2009-04-25 11:26:00,1505,"Nice haul for the first outing, WTG..."
334654,Rattletrap2,2009-04-25 17:23:00,1652,"Nice going Leechman! Always wanted to catch trout from a lake, but so far have not."
334661,Joeytier,2009-04-25 17:54:00,3990,Great stuff!  Can't beat a feed of fresh coldwater trout.
334703,Leecher,2009-04-25 20:40:00,7832, You beat me to it..... Thanks Cudz   Thanks Steve!!!  No this time was an annual leave and approved   Thanks b2kptbo!!!   Thanks Rattletrap!!!   Thanks Joeytier!!!
334740,Musky or Specks,2009-04-25 22:34:00,2710,Great catch but I dont think  they are specks. The forking of the tail probably make them f1 slakes and great guilt free eating. I might be wrong though its ard to tell in pics
334743,smokin joe,2009-04-25 22:45:00,226,"Great job on the specks Jacques, thanks for the pics and the report.  Those partridges sure can hide.  Thanks for sharing"
334744,bigugli,2009-04-25 22:47:00,6138,Nice looking catch. WTG.

334757,Leecher,2009-04-25 23:25:00,7832," Thanks Musky or Specks!!! Trust me, they are speckles for sure   Thanks smokin joe!!! They sure can   Thanks Bruce!!!"
334485,Leecher,2009-04-24 21:40:00,7832,"Hi guys and gals,  been a while since I last posted a report and I'm real happy to finally be able to post again    Man that was a long haul    LOL I took the day off since it was trout opener, could not resist.  The plan was for my daughter and I to go try for some specks.  She decided differently   and that's OK.... went by myself to a lake that QMNR stocks specks and was I ever glad I did  Left home at around 10:30am after repeatedly asking my daughter to join me and got there at 12:30pm.  There was already a few local guys that were fishing from shore and finally found a spot that was a respectable distance away from them. Got setup, tied on a swivel to the main line, a bell sinker and one of those walleye rigs that has a slip bobber, micro hook and a worm.  I spoke to the elderly fellow  beside me and ask if it was biting..... He said that he got there at 7:30am and not a single bite  I ask him if the lake had been stocked this year and he replied yes and that there was plenty of trout     That somehow got the blood flowing and totally forgot that I had a nice subway sandwich in the cooler LOL.  This is when I noticed the other guy beside him pull out a speck.  Not two minutes goes by and pulls another  He had found a honey hole and was having a blast.... Then all of sudden I get a nibble, set the hook and land my very first speck of the year     a small one but a keeper.  No pictures of it because.... well keep reading and you'll understand why.... The trout had swallowed the hook and when I used the pliers to remove the hook, I snap the line  Had to setup another rig and put on another worm before I could continue fishing.... I also got into a frenzy and was able to catch another 6, which made my total to 7 and decide to call it a day.  At 2:00pm left and got home around 4:00pm.  On my way home, on the dirk road I noticed something on the road.... when I got closer, this is what I saw    A nice partridge that wasn't afraid of the car..... was able to snap a pic.  and my guest for supper tonight    All in all drove 4 hours, fished an hour and a half and got 7 specks..... lost half a nickel on shore Had a fun time and now got to go prep those specks for the pan Hope you enjoy Jacques"
334486,Beats,2009-04-24 21:46:00,543,"Wow, great catch there.  Looks tasty."
334492,solopaddler,2009-04-24 22:15:00,8605,"Awesome, can't wait to get a few myself! When was ice out where you were fishing?"
334495,Cookslav,2009-04-24 22:17:00,1457,"Nice job, some tasty eats there for sure! But to be honest...I can't see the Partridge? Am I blind?"
334498,Bondar,2009-04-24 22:20:00,817,click on the picture and zoom in pretty much center   Beauty fish sounds like a great trip Congrats
334501,bushart,2009-04-24 22:25:00,2628,Looks great---nothing like a feed of specks--it's what makes us Canadian.  Bushart
334503,Whitespinnerbait,2009-04-24 22:31:00,2038,"WoW .....   Lucky Guy to be off work on a Beautiful day like today, and a plate of speck's to boot    :worthy:      Nice outing Jacques...."

334525,Leecher,2009-04-24 23:48:00,7832," Thanks Dan!!!   The specks were on fire, nothing big but good for the pan.  Last time I fished that lake, my girl friend back then, now my wife, didn't even get a single bite.... what a reward it was to land those beauties"
334528,misfish,2009-04-24 23:57:00,29133, Found it.Big bird.
