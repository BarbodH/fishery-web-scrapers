334820,crappieperchhunter,2009-04-26 02:19:00,2582,Good job Emil. Did your young lad go with you? I still think about what a trooper he was the day we went smelting.  Been perching on Simcoe for the last 2 weeks. Today was crappie in the Kawarthas. Looks like we both had fish to clean today.  Thx for the pic and report.

334843,icefisherman,2009-04-26 03:14:00,952,"  Steve, how are you doing Bud? He sure was, and so was the younger one and his mom...the whole family, tried to use the forecasted ""nice sunny day"". Didn't turn very sunny but hey...who said the weatherman ever gets it right??!?  Might try some Lake O. Kings tomorrow but I am thinking....if you need a company for those crappies some time soon let me know I would be happy to join you with my son one time. I just haven't targeted crappies until now but would love to try for a day.  Not to mention it'll be hard to find better crappie teacher than you!  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
