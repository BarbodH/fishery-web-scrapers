334455,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-24 20:08:00,10439,You want a great experience go out of Port Credit with my buddy Wayne aboard Fishy Buisness Charters (He's on the river) What ever you want he can arrange for you.    His boat is comfortable for 6-8 anglers. Fishy Business  If you have a larger crowd talk to another buddy of mine Wayne Andrews of Andrews Charters. He is also located on the river in Port Credit and has two boats up to 52' in length that can handle 14 to 16 per boat. Andrews Charters  Over the years I have worked on both of their baots and they will both catch you some fish and show you a great time.  Late July and August are the best times for fishing out of Port Credit.
334464,Dusky,2009-04-24 20:30:00,310,"We did a charter last year with www.reelhard.net I guess his name is Bowan. Good fishing, good service and good price."
