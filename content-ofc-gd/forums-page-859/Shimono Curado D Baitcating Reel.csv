I don't know if they have this deal in all their stores, but if you are looking for one it's worth a try.  They are probably selling off their inventory since they introduced the Curado E.  I can't imagine the E is that much better than the D."

I also get the feeling shimano is about update the calcutta reels right from the low end B's up to the digital DC's at the top.  I saw huge discounts on them at a local stores and online (BPS for example)."
