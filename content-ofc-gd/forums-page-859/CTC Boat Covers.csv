334387,rob v,2009-04-24 16:25:00,535,My flyer lists this boat cover on sale this week.  I'm looking for something mainly for while my boat is parked outside in the driveway (stored inside during the winter) and I'm not really worried about trailering with the cover on.  Anybody have good or bad experience with this type of cover ?  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/Sp...oat%2BCover.jsp
334391,ecmilley,2009-04-24 16:36:00,2163,you won't get a better cover for the price if your just using it for storing in the driveway
334406,rhare,2009-04-24 17:35:00,387,"Its a good cover for sitting in your driveway. I pulled my boat with one last year and the cam at the back broke and did a considerable amount of damage to my brand new motor. Needless to say I was pissed and took it back. The material is good quality, but be careful pulling with it."
334410,cranks bait,2009-04-24 17:49:00,721,"I bought the one that was all blue from CTC a couple of years ago.  I left my boat on an electric uncovered lift for the winter with just that on it.  It worked great.  Just had to remove the snow so that it didn't build up too much.  I've also used it to just cover the boat in monsoon like conditions.  My boat was dry until I trippped and dumped the pooled water inside it. I do not trailer with it on.  All in all, yes it is a good buy."
