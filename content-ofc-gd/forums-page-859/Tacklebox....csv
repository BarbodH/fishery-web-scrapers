333667,Governator,2009-04-22 21:52:00,879,"  Thanks, that makes a lot of sense.  Does everyone tie directly to their spinnerbaits?  I only ask this stuff as I got to pick up a few spinners now."
333676,Beans,2009-04-22 22:08:00,3339,"You can always slip a piece of surgical tubing over the ""R"" bend to form an eye..."
333709,GBW,2009-04-22 22:47:00,8460,"SHHHH, you buy it slowly...keep your change, it adds up and nobody know just how much you have...  Thanks.  The spoons and inline spinners and all the other stuff is in my travel case (in the car) but some is at the cottage.   Hey now, LOL.  I need to have lots for me and my wife and kids.  My wife will fish off the dock with me at night when the kids are in bed.  That is why there is 2 or more of most things.  If one of us starts hitting fish the other changes to that bait for some action too."
333869,adempsey,2009-04-23 07:28:00,1498,"Overall, looks me to like you got most bases basically covered.  I'd pick up some single tail grubs.  Best all around artificial bait IMO. All fish species, all seasons.  You may also want to augment some plastics with a couple of colors.  I typically buy at least 1 earthtone (brown,green), 1 white/pink and 1 crazy bright like chartreuse/lotsa sparkles.  Yum brand are a good value IMO.  Maybe add a lipless crankbait."
333871,Fudd,2009-04-23 07:43:00,94,"99% of all the lures on the market are designed to catch the fisherman. Grab some Canadian wrigglers,  some spoons ( cleo's, lucky strikes, daredevils)... 3-4 raps, a couple different sized flatfish and a few bucktail jiggs. This covers all your bases. the most important tool is a few sinkers and hooks and a few minnows.  Even when i troll for salmon or bows, 50% of the time i don't use lures, cutbait is just as effective and the strike rate is higher. Go smelting, salt and freeze them. You will have bait year round and top fishing."
333934,wallyboss,2009-04-23 14:16:00,1095,You need a couple of frogs for the slop.
333943,diggyj,2009-04-23 14:46:00,548,The key is to get a bigger tackle box! Then you have to get more tackle!  Dirk
334676,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-25 18:31:00,3761,"I added a few more spoons + a blue fox spinner to my tackle, made myself a ""blade box"". I'll tell ya how these work out, CT has a Williams 4 pack on for $20 bucks...witch is not bad considering that there spoons are mainly 7-10 bucks, either way i got the 4 pack and another spoon (Whitefish) that was recommended to me by some board members and a little Blue Fox spinner. That kit had these Williams Lite W55 spoons(2) and 2 Dartee spoons."
333512,Governator,2009-04-22 17:08:00,879,"So I'm new to fishing, just started last summer but since have spent a crap load of money for a so called ""cheap hobby"" and wondering what I should add to it now that I'm super addicted lol.  I have to replace spinnerbaits as I threw them out.  I'm an idiot and didn't clean them off before storing away, so they went orange and rusted on me.  This is what it looks like now, anything you think I should add?  This is just for fishing for pike, bass, etc...  I also picked up a new 7' MH Fast Action Bass Pro Rod and an Abu Garcia Reel (Just the 100 series).     "
333514,Dara,2009-04-22 17:13:00,3052,"Gold/Silver Williams wabbler, aka, dinner bell  cheap sport..ha ha, who told you that"
333515,Governator,2009-04-22 17:14:00,879,"  The worm on a bobber guys....  lol....  Gold/Silver wobbler eh, that's a classic I think I should get that."
333517,bassjnkie,2009-04-22 17:17:00,1101,I would add some senkos or senko type baits.
333522,BillM,2009-04-22 17:24:00,17367,I don't see any 'walk the dog' type topwater baits.  Bass and pike love those...  2 or 3 Zara spooks in different sizes would be a good addition me thinks.
333530,Governator,2009-04-22 17:32:00,879," Yea I don't really have those, I have some of the Gulp & Power Baits in the top drawer but that's about it.     Yea I just picked up a hula popper to try topwater, little more basic for me.  Can walking the dog be done with a spinning reel?  I haven't advanced myself to the baitcaster yet hehe."
333533,xeon,2009-04-22 17:37:00,350,What are you fishing for?
333534,BillM,2009-04-22 17:40:00,17367," Nothing gets easier then walking the dog   Spinning outfit is fine...  You really can't do it wrong, the more you screw it up the better it looks, lol"
333536,Governator,2009-04-22 17:42:00,879,"  Pike & Bass, I've yet to try Walleye Fishing but don't know what I need for that.      lol!!  That's a good call indeed."
333542,xeon,2009-04-22 17:53:00,350,"Get more x-raps, rattlin raps and a nice set of plyers. Also try some more colours on the rapalas. Boat maybe?"
333544,pike slayer,2009-04-22 17:56:00,1177,"you definitly do not have enough xraps! they hammer pike, bass and walleye! get different sizes and colours, also the xshad raps are definitly a must have in a tackle box. also you have like zero flashy spoons for pike lucky strike half wave and super flash are a must and a few williams are needed in there to."
333564,GBW,2009-04-22 18:52:00,8460,"Well, here is what I have in the basement right now for bass, walleye, pike, musky and panfish.  I have more in the car, in the garage and more at the cottage.              "
333573,Governator,2009-04-22 19:08:00,879,"   WOW... that is incredible!  Hopefully one day I'll have that collection.  Mind if you I did, my wife would probably threaten to kill me."
333592,bassjnkie,2009-04-22 19:47:00,1101,"I forgot my favorite bait. The Heddon prop (looks like the spook with a prop) and the Rapala skitter prop (frog colour) Nothing special to these baits, just rip 3-4 time on the surface, and pause for 10 seconds. Then repeat. Basically like the Hula popper.  Great selection GBW."
333593,TJQ,2009-04-22 19:51:00,7806,"Wheres all the spoons people??? LOL  You have to have a few of these in your box to troll with... geeezzzz...  3 inch lucky strike superflash.. I have caught litterally all species.. pickeral, pike, muskie, perch and trout on it...  its my confidence lure. (as much as I have confidence that is)  "
333618,ehg,2009-04-22 20:13:00,2666,"That is what i was thinking 'walk the dog' bass topwaters. Storm chugbugs are good and cheap for a popper, Jitterbugs are effective as well. Get a trailer hook for your spinnerbaits and add a pork strip to the back and your rockin'."
333623,Governator,2009-04-22 20:20:00,879,"You guys are awesome, thank you!!!"
333638,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-22 20:52:00,3761,"Now I think you need some more soft plastics dude, like dingers, solid coloured tubes. Maybe a few more cranks and x-raps also would do the trick. Now I don't have nearly as much as GBW has(Too Much) but what I have here get's me by. Also I suggest getting a tackle bag with the trays unlike I did, the box i have now is getting pretty heavy and a pain to carry around especially since i shore fish.  Here are some pictures: Tackle Box-   Hooks Weight's ect..   Inside (Soft Plastics)   2nd part to soft plastics  Spinnerbaits/Buzzbaits   Spoons/Bucktail  Drawer #1 Cranks/topwater   Drawer #2 Jerkbaits/heavy cover baits   Drawer #3 Soft Plastic Swimbaits (New to me)  Packaged Baits    This is basically all I got + 2 container's of gulp alive and much more than I need to have a great time fishing with. Also thing's like plyers, hook sharpeners, reel oil, fishing ropes, and other various tools are important to get.   Best of luck and with a little more tackle you should be fine, now just use what u got and buy what works for you not what looks pretty..."
333642,pike slayer,2009-04-22 21:01:00,1177,TJ i had already posted that lucky strike super flash just didnt put a picture of it. that is definitly one of the best lures out there! pike just destroy them! i've caught them in the summer and jigging with them in the winter on that lure!
333643,purekgw,2009-04-22 21:03:00,585,"its a nice start you going there you do need more topwater, senko's, jigs  and x-raps are key heres mine  crank baits   top waters   randoms   tubes, bass jigs and jig heads   a few of my bass spinners   some gulp, yum and other soft   and one of my 2 worm binders all senkos can never have to many   just buy stuff as you go and you should be set and watch out for deals like buy 1 get 1 frees are always good    :thumbsup_anim:"
333647,Governator,2009-04-22 21:11:00,879,"Nice collection!!!  I love how everyone is so organized.  Perhaps it's because we've had a long winter to keep things organized, but usually my boxes are a mess lol.  Would like to fix that this year.  Here are my (limited) plastics...  I do have some nicer plyers lol but got this ancient old deep hook remover from my uncle (Probably time to update lol).  I like the idea of a hook sharpener, is that something that would sharpen trebles as well?     And my boxes more up close.  I think I might have to get more x-raps and more topwater which I haven't really played with.  Right now bucktails are my favourite to throw too bad they are a bit pricey.  I do fish a lot of shallow water as well.     "
333648,young_one,2009-04-22 21:12:00,620,"jointed-rapala(float) regular wide-gap hook for the senko type plastics,(more of a natural drop) HP hooks from Eagle Claw are pretty good. I really like the YUM senkos, cheaper and catch just as many fish. Gulp tend to dry up if you dont store properly, plus the stickiness. But the scent is irresistable to fish. Try darker colour tubes with gold or purple sparkles to them. Imitation of crayfish or gobies. Your red tube jig will do, or rig texas with widegap and cone weight. Coffee tube from Strike King, Mizmo tubes."
333651,Governator,2009-04-22 21:18:00,879,"  That is awesome... Hey I got a question:  What's the purpose of spinnerbaits having an open eye?  If it's open, do you always have to tie to it in order to keep it from sliding?  I find a snap swivel is useless with them unless they are a closed eye.  I don't get the point of having it open but practically every single spinnerbait at basspro is open eyed."
333657,young_one,2009-04-22 21:32:00,620,"open eye spinner bait... - easier for the manufacture to make - slightly more weedless - open eye has a unbent plane, I assume it would run more straight, where as a bend might cause it to go side to side"
333663,purekgw,2009-04-22 21:43:00,585,yah i find the open eye one runs straighter
