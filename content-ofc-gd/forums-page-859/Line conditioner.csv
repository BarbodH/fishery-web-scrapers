334145,bucktail,2009-04-24 00:13:00,1857,Anyone use it? It's something I have always meant to try but always forget to pick up.   Darren
334167,Fudd,2009-04-24 01:02:00,94,"I never did till i came down under. The salt is hard on the line, i started using Kevin VanDamâ€™s line conditioner ( hard time finding it now) and the stuff really works. Makes the line very pliable and easy to cast even after a whole season on the reel. It maybe my imagination but i even seem to cast farther with it. When i return home it will continue to use it.. top product imo."
