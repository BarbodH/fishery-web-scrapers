Lotsa insanity going on in town and the liquor store has even opened up 2 hrs. early every day this week!  Ol Yeller drove past the track on the Interstate last night on her way home from work and said the smoke from all the BBQ grills reduced visibility by 50% and you could smell every kind of meat cooking imaginable.  Gonna be lots of drunk Rednecks, traffic tickets, and several   -es will go to jail.  It's a helluva party... but I think I'll stay home and work in the yard... those race folks is crazy yanno!"

Can't wait a couple more weeks till pics open up. I'll be watching the rednecks race later.....should be exciting.
