Just wondering if i'll see anybody out fishing for the trout/suckers. I'll be out trying to catch a few suckers and at some spots I saw good numbers of suckers in the 1-3lb range, water looks clear and well hopefully any rain will hold off until opener.  Question ->    When fishing for the suckers, i like to find them/see them if i can. I'll be using worms or gulp, now should i throw the bait on bottom with a heavy weight so it just sits there?"

334071,ehg,2009-04-23 21:23:00,2666,Was under the impression that it opened Saturday the 25th. You can catch suckers on worms in any pool (especially if you can't see bottom).  Why not try/cast all that tackle you got at the harbour?
334073,GBW,2009-04-23 21:28:00,8460,I hope to be out Monday...

334081,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-23 21:53:00,3761, I like your impression
334084,danbouck,2009-04-23 22:02:00,4380,It opens Saturday.
334099,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-23 22:41:00,2050,"I used to float fish them exactly the same way you drift for steelhead....just make sure you have a long enough lead so your bait bounces on bottom.  The other way is to put a slip sinker on your line, then tie a swivel and add a leader that goes to your hook.  Cast it out and let it sit on bottom, just like you're carpin'.  This way if you break off you'll still have your slip sinker and swivel.  Also, the sucker won't feel the weight like it will if you use splitshots.  Worms, raw shrimp, and gulp have all worked for me in the past.  Good luck dude!  They're lots of fun.  Cheers, UF"
334150,KelfuN,2009-04-24 00:22:00,246,you might catch a steelhead while fishing for suckers!
334334,GoneFishin,2009-04-24 13:50:00,349,Find a nice spot on Saturday* when it opens and target rainbows!!! you'll catch suckers around the trout that will keep you busy if the bites not on. If your gonna target only suckers I would just grab a fly rod and let some nymphs drag across the bottom. If you don't have bottom contact you probably wont catch any suckers but if you get it down to the bottom it doesn't really matter what you use.
334382,Marko,2009-04-24 15:59:00,854,Easiest way to catch suckers is on worms. Sinker and a hook and a worm and let it sit at the bottom. If they are around they`ll hit.
334405,majorlifts,2009-04-24 17:17:00,171,IT OPENS SATURDAY!!!!!!!!! That is what the reg book say.
