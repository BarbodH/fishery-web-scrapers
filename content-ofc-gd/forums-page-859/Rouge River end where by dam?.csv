This could be the area you're talking about  but I'm not aware of any dam and I've never seen hundreds of people there, maybe a dozen. I'm not sure what you mean by Rouge River end, it doesn't ""end"" anywhere near here. You can also access the Rouge at the end of Island Rd."

334864,John Bacon,2009-04-26 04:30:00,3277,Rainbow do make it up to and past the Milne Dam.  That is why they put the fish ladder there.
334921,Paully,2009-04-26 12:58:00,712,i dont think you can fish right by the dam anyways.... make sure you read and follow the rules..
