334021,kemper,2009-04-23 19:00:00,2232,"Headed out today for some droppies on the lower end of an east trib. Got a couple yesterday so I figured I would give it another shot.  Went 3/4 and my buddy was 0/1, all fish on roe.  First fish was an absolute HOG, I can only imagine what a fish this size would look like pre spawn...probably would push the 16-17 pound mark full of eggs. She kicked my ars up and down but I managed to beach her 40 M down from where the battle started.  Here she is    and back she goes    Next up was another feisty dropback hen, also smashed a roe bag right in the wood and I had a hell of a time keepin her out of the wood the entire battle. In the end I had to just lock it down and hope the lead held...       and a little male was the last fish interested.    Good couple hours, now bring on opener!"
334022,Victor,2009-04-23 19:09:00,1609,"Nice fish kemper, first one is a hog indeed!!"
334029,BillM,2009-04-23 19:39:00,17367,"Kemper, that is a fatty!  Way to go man!"
334062,GBW,2009-04-23 20:50:00,8460,"I knew I missed all the good fun as you and your buddy were pulling out just when I got there.  Yes, that was me letting you guys out so I could pull in the parking lot and give it a go just after one..."
334080,Leecher,2009-04-23 21:53:00,7832,Great report and pics Kemp  That's a good couple hours spent on the trib for sure.... Congratulations on that beast Thanks for sharing Leechman

334182,young_one,2009-04-24 01:35:00,620,Nice fish! The river you are fishing seems to be in great conditions! I have a slight feeling of where it is. Some one must've finished all their finals...mean while I still have to study for mine.
334232,kemper,2009-04-24 03:49:00,2232,every time I look at that picture the thing seems to get bigger  thanks guys

334238,Greencoachdog,2009-04-24 04:07:00,8163,"The fish will actually look biger if you hold them at a 90 degree angle to your body...  ... I know the ""Girl holding an AK-47 for the first time"" pose is cute, but....    Just razzin' ya a little Kemp! Glad to see ya got out and you're getting into some noice fish!!!   ... have you run into Cliff and bly lately?.. or are they still fawning over their boat and the prospects of open water???"

It was a lamprey scar that never really sealed up, there was two on that fish, and one on both the others as well  Thanks guys, it was a great day"

334518,kemper,2009-04-24 23:32:00,2232, Did I forget to mention that it was his first bow on the pin?  I remember when I hooked my first fish on the pin...a 4 lb brown that made me look SILLY. Gotta love the pinner
