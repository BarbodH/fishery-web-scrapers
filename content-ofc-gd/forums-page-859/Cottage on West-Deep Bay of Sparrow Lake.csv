334122,jediangler,2009-04-23 23:21:00,1923,There are walleye there as well but all the species you mentioned are out of season.
334125,MSBruno,2009-04-23 23:24:00,369, I intended this message to mean that I was fishing here when season opens.
334128,jediangler,2009-04-23 23:28:00,1923,"At the mouth of deep bay, where it meets the main lake, I've caught pike on spinnerbaits, largies on sluggos and walleyes on jig & grub combos."

334587,Rizzo,2009-04-25 02:43:00,4754,funny timing of this thread. I was just talking to a guy today who has a cottage on Deep Bay. He was asking me where he might target a musky on Sparrow. The way he described his own shoreline I told him to start fishing off his own dock! Anyone ever target/catch muskies in Sparrow anymore? Its been years since I fished there and we only were after pike/bass in those days.
