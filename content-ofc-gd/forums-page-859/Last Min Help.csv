333863,young_one,2009-04-23 05:56:00,620,"Tomorrow afternoon, I plan to take my 2 friends way back from highschool to catch some sucker. Ive had good success catching sucker at Duffin last week. After all the rain we had, the river should be pretty blown consider its Duffins. Im pretty confident with my location, but sometimes a back up is nice.  New to fishing + lots of action = hooked to fishing   I have not yet try any Rouge or other river in the area for sucker. I just want to have a plan B if Duffin suckers dont bite. Any help? pm if you need to keep your sucker locations secret  (how far north can I fish the Rouge river? I understand most of the Eastern Tribs are south of the railway only, is Rouge any different?)  I hope Im not asking too much, after all its only sucker fishing."

333917,Victor,2009-04-23 12:57:00,1609,"don't know about conditions but you are correct, south of CNR bridge for all the tribs, including rouge."
333932,MJL,2009-04-23 14:08:00,2427,I've always fished below the CNR tracks in Durham region and below hwy 2 at the Rouge which are the year round sections for for steelhead and trout on those rivers.  I've been getting into suckers on almost all the tribs I've fished since early April.  Should be lots around on all the creeks and rivers.
