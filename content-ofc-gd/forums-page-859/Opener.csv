334692,bigugli,2009-04-25 20:05:00,6138,"Like most of us, I awaited, with eager anticipation, the trout opener.The small sucker and trout stream had cleared and I knew the trout were still in the one pool. Here in Niagara it was a beautiful spring morning. The sun was shining. The first of the woodland blooms were coming out.  I quietly sneak up to the edge of the pool and there, on the edge, were 2 suckers and a small bow stuck in a mess of grape meshing. So out we wade, scissors in hand, to cut open the net and free the fish. With a little work, all three swam away O.K. So much for my chances at the pool. I had spooked everything else, and they were now hiding under a log jam.   My plan B was the mouth of Jordan harbour, but the place was crammed with trucks, trailers and boats. Derby time  Now we are on to plan 'C'. Charles Daley to fish the pond. The recent storms have given the beach a real pounding. So one is either walking the surf or pushing through the scrub. Debris everywhere.   I'm there all of 10 minutes and I have a cat on.  I 'm figuring the day isn't going to be so bad after all. 20 minutes later. ""Bang"" The drag starts screaming and you can see the fish's wake. I've only got 6lb mono so its a good 20 minutes to work thig pig in.  This carp is 32"" long. The arm holding the tape is a local Scout who was doing a shorline cleanup when I hooked the fish. Him and his bud did the honors of netting the beast, thereby doing their good turn for the day. I can't post their pic because I don't have a Scouts Canada release. Afte rthat it was kitties all day long. All 1-3 lbs.   A great end result for the day despite the sunburn."

334714,smokin joe,2009-04-25 20:57:00,226,Congrats Bruce on freeing those fish even though it meant loosing you chance at the fishing   and you got to release a trout in the process  Have you noticed how often lately that Plan C seems to be the productive one  Great job on the cats and the carp for Team 3   Wait until Dawg see's this post
334746,bigugli,2009-04-25 22:52:00,6138, Somebody should send him a banana  I was pretty bummed about the creek. The nets are quite long. They are used to keep starlings off the ice grapes. They dig into the flesh rather quickly
334802,iCarp,2009-04-26 01:32:00,50,That last photo of the catfish is a winner.  I really like it.
