333847,Ramble,2009-04-23 03:42:00,713,I just got a new-to-me 12 guage and need a place to pattern her before turkey season. If anyone knows of a place i can put a few shells through her plz let me know. It will only be me and my house mate. I don't care where as long as i'm not any laws.   Here's a few pic's of it. Winchester 1300 XTR Price was right for my budget and it came with 3 chokes. It has very little wear.      Tight Lines.  -Dave
