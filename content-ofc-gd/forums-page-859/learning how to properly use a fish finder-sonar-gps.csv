I came across this  -  anybody try watching this video  (Finding Fish with Modern Technology -  Learn to Properly Read & Tune Your Sonar, )  http://www.havefunfishing.com/bass_fishing_videos.htm   I know there's nothing like on the water experience to learn but i thought this might be easier than reading the book.  Any input/experience  ?"

He video taped his graph, and you can actually see the fish coming up after his jig.  The new graphs are pretty kick ass - you can easily learn how to use it inside of a day once reading the manual that comes with it.  When I got my new Humminbird I was more than confident, marking fish and able to read bottom by the end of my first day on the water.  Keep in mind that I was out that day to LEARN MY GRAPH.  I barely picked up a rod, other than to drop a jig down below my sensor to see what it looked like on the graph.  Cheers, UF"

If you didn't buy there drop in and ask, say the wife bought it for you.  Josh at the tackle store in Cambridge has a rep. for electronics.  Garnet"
