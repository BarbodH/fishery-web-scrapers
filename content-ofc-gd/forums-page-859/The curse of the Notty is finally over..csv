334135,BillM,2009-04-23 23:47:00,17367,"Well, after seeing Kempers thread today I decided to break out the pin one more time to try this damn river that's skunked me everytime I've been on it.  Conditions weren't that great with only 3-4inches of vis, but what the hell.  The weather was nice, the sun was shining and I had a few hours to waste.  Hit the first pool that I'm familar with and was greeted with this sight..    So much for that pool!! (note the giant landslide on the right, lol)  I can't believe how much the winter has changed this river.  It's like a night and day difference.  After fishing this river a few times during late Sept of last year with a low water level, I figured out where a few nice runs were inbetween pools.  I hit one of those and the first drift down goes the float!  Nice little chromer with lots of spunk.  A quick pic and she was on her way.  "
334137,Rustic-Fisher,2009-04-23 23:53:00,826,Told ya there were fish !!! lol Nice fish!
334138,troutologist,2009-04-23 23:53:00,951,"Good job man, they will start to come easier from that river now. Had a few tribs that shut me out many times...keep after them and you always seem to learn alot.  Chrome!"
334139,silvio,2009-04-23 23:56:00,433,Wtg Bill I've been going north lately with great success bud. your close to some amazing water the notty being my favourite. Great fish nice to see your time finally paid off... Always happens when you think it wont... and never when you think it will eh?
334141,BillM,2009-04-24 00:04:00,17367,"Sil, you're right man   I haven't fished to many of the rivers up here except for a few major ones.  I need to change that, lol"
334142,misfish,2009-04-24 00:06:00,29133,Nice try at the photo chop.LOL WTG Bill. That spot produces.
334205,Greencoachdog,2009-04-24 02:19:00,8163,Glad you were'nt arrested for molesting Baby Fish!!!
334208,BillM,2009-04-24 02:25:00,17367," If the regs allowed, I was going to ship them down for you to use as bait"
334226,wallacio,2009-04-24 03:32:00,475,Nice Bill - glad to hear that the Notty skunk isn't following you around anymore!!!
334231,MJL,2009-04-24 03:48:00,2427, Baby fish?  That fish is 15lbs...It just so happens Bill is 10ft tall and has hands bigger than a yeti's  WTG Bill!  The Notty is definitely one river I'd love to fish...I'm hoping to make it up there this summer for maybe carp and in the fall for some steel.  I can't wait.
334275,solopaddler,2009-04-24 11:50:00,8605,Well done my friend! So how do you like the new rod?
334282,silvio,2009-04-24 12:12:00,433,New rod   Bill you got another rod?
334283,Leecher,2009-04-24 12:14:00,7832,Great job BillM Nice trout and thanks for sharing Leechman
334320,BillM,2009-04-24 13:19:00,17367," It's awesome man.  I can really load it up when I cast, which is nice.  With my Loomis IM6 it seems like I really need to muscle it in order to bomb out a cast, with the GL3 it just loads up and is gone  Sil: I've got 3 complete setups now... what can I say this floatfishing thing is addicting.  5 days and counting Mike!!"
334327,highdrifter,2009-04-24 13:38:00,2534,Kewl!!  Always wanted to fish the Notty...  Whatcha gonna dou with the IM6 budday?!
334337,BillM,2009-04-24 13:59:00,17367, The Loomis IM6 would have to be torn from my cold dead hands   I love that rod.  It's a funky custom built 3 piece.  You looking for a setup?
334338,highdrifter,2009-04-24 14:03:00,2534," Yeah I bet it's sentimental value is through the roof!  Always looking to up my arsenal..  Realistically speaking, I'm hoping to get something proper by the fall..  I'm banking Solo is gonna link me up!!"
334362,silvio,2009-04-24 14:55:00,433,Bill I hear you... I got 7 float rods and a new ang specs being machined as we speak. whats the 3rd reel you got now? GL3 a nice rod bud good going on picking one up.
334366,ccmtcanada,2009-04-24 15:04:00,7971,I knew it was just a matter of time Bill!!!  I also knew you wouldn't hang up the float gear like you said in another thread quite yet...LOL.  Congrats on the fish!
334479,lucabrasi,2009-04-24 21:25:00,114,Nice going! Persistence pays off. I know how you feel. Hopefully I'll be able to break my Credit curse next week.
334608,solopaddler,2009-04-25 10:54:00,8605," Actually bro I do have a rod for you.    7 float rods? Dude that's crazy LOL! Bill's GL3 probably isn't what you think.. It's the 131/2' 3pc not the more popular 13' 2pc. Fantastic rod, don't know why it was never more popular."
334669,silvio,2009-04-25 18:08:00,433,Coming from the gear junkie   . Mike I got my g2 hopefully we can go smash some fish together again. I learned a lot about reading water that day we went.
334677,Rattletrap2,2009-04-25 18:32:00,1652,Nice fish Bill! Looks like they really take on the colour of their surroundings? I'm sure they would be a bit darker in clear water would they not?
