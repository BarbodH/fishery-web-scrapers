334243,silverstreak,2009-04-24 04:59:00,146,Steelies are a little late in dropping down this yr but still managed a few. Today's bait of choice.......a pink Riverworm. 
334245,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-24 05:01:00,270,  cool ! great fish and Pink seems to be a good color when it comes to fish!  That pink worm is scented?
334248,silverstreak,2009-04-24 05:10:00,146,Droppies were also interested in the non scented light pink colour.

334332,highdrifter,2009-04-24 13:45:00,2534,Awesome picture!!  Well done.
334356,kemper,2009-04-24 14:36:00,2232,"Nice fish... I often forget that dropback hens will hit ANYTHING some days, that worm is huge"
334545,canadian_copper,2009-04-25 00:51:00,925,LOOKS HUGE BUT THERE JUST A TAD BIGGER THEN THE BERKLEY PINKIES. I REALLY PREFER THOSE RIVERWOOD WORMS WHEN THE WATER HAS TINGE OR WELL STAINED.
334553,silverstreak,2009-04-25 01:17:00,146,Not Necessarily Kemper....we fished with roe for over an hour at first light with no hits. Soon as we switched to worms and jigs we were into a few. Cheers.
