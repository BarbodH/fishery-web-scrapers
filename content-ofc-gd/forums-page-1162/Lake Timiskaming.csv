I seem to be able to catch fish stick size walllye there. Some tips would be appreciated on what to try from someone who knows the area. The cottage is near mission point since its a big lake."
104330,walleyebob,2007-08-16 14:42:00,27,I was also wondering is it worth it to make the trek to the dam were the montreal river dumps into timiskaming. Near been there because it'd a far boat ride .
104336,mcallister.grant,2007-08-16 15:11:00,327,"Hi there,  I have never fished the area but I noticed you mentioned the word ""dam"". In my experiences with dams; I have had nothing but success. I always fish the dams from nightfall onwards. I am not sure what you're using but I have always been very successful with 2 inch shiner minnows nicely weighted so they just bounce off the bottom. It has worked for me time and time again. Good luck!"
104376,walleyebob,2007-08-16 17:26:00,27,"I typically use minnows on a jig head , i have tried trolling rapalas and such without much luck also. It's a very deep lake i just bougth a fish finder and am think of trying down rigging because i marked most of the fish down 70-100ft on my last outing."
104382,lunkerbasshunter,2007-08-16 17:53:00,2585,was up there about 10 years ago and it is a wonderful area!  The fishing was good from what i recall but cant really remember much about what we used or caught.  Cheers!
