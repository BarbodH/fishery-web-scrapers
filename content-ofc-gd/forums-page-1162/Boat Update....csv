104622,bucketmouthjohnny,2007-08-17 14:39:00,115,"That's great Gerritt, i knew you wouldn't have just mounted it to 1/8 inch alum. but i have seen many guys do that.5/8 mg ply is plenty solid enough!! Now, where are you putting the steering wheel    jk, it will be a lean mean fishin machine!!!"
104628,bucketmouthjohnny,2007-08-17 14:52:00,115,"Gerritt, just relooked at the pics, i have a suggestion for you. You might want to run a 1 inch pvc from the rear to the front for the trolling motor wiring, unless you are putting the battery up front. If so, than might i suggest running a 1/2 or 3/4 inch pvc pipe for future electonics because i am sure your starting battery is in the rear.you would need 2 90 degree bends tobring the pipe just past the floor. food for thought is all, John."
104675,Gerritt,2007-08-17 16:55:00,6129,  Yeqah there is a battery up front for the trolling motor.... it is hard to see in the picture but the cord for the trolling motor has a stove plug on it  it will be simple to hook up and remove using the plug.  Thanks for the suggestion though!   Gerritt.
104692,Vanselena,2007-08-17 17:32:00,269,"My joists are 12"" apart and I used 5/8"" mg ply and there isn't a squeak in the boat."
104773,easton13th,2007-08-17 21:36:00,371,Wow nice work all around! Gerrit I am sure you are loking forward to getting that in the water.  Easton
104794,Gerritt,2007-08-17 22:36:00,6129,"  Your project looked like alot of work!! Labour of Love I hope! lol!  Sweet looking ride when you were done!    Easton, I should have the floor in this weekend.. I pickup up some Alum Angle and the square tubing today... man Aluminium aint cheap!! and I even got it at my contractors rate! LOL... Ahhhh well I got a very heavy gauge as I want stability and never having to worry about it again makes it worth it...besides some OFC'rs are heavier then others! LOL  I will be sure to take pics once I get the floor going..   Gerritt."
104245,Gerritt,2007-08-16 11:56:00,6129,"I have been busy with work and family commitments so finding a spare couple hours to work on my boat has been difficult.. I have made some progress though... Here are some pictures..  I still need to tidy these up... and add some more Wire Wrap....the three coloured wire you see is the remote T/T wire     Sterm Light Socket installed.... I was a bit nervous drill a 1-3/8"" into her.... but it worked out fantastic!    This is the wire that is running to the Bow Light.. I removed the Corner Brackets and feed the wire through the gunwale then wrapped it... Makes for a cleaner install I think.    Here is where I mounted the switch for the Stern and Bow Lamps... It is an old school Push/Oull switch... but extremely solid and should last my lifetime! Thanks Bernie!    Here is the Bow light I feel in love with when I saw it on an old cedar strip up @ Bernies place... It is unique and not like the run of the mill lamps you buy today... I just better not crack the lenses!!! You will also see I have the trolling Motor installed.     Seat is mounted on a quick release ...      The View from the rear...     I still have a ton of work to do to her... I am going to take your suggestions and purchase the clamp on mount for the middle bench seat...  I also have to purchase a Ram Mount  and then I finally have to put a floor in her and she is good to go!  Hope you enjoy seeing her progress:)  Gerritt."
104252,lunkerbasshunter,2007-08-16 12:02:00,2585,hey that is awesome!  You have her looking good!  Thanks for the update!  Cheers!
104253,bigfish1965,2007-08-16 12:03:00,3382,"Judging by the layout, G, you should even be able to put in a hatch in the floor for a storage compartment up front for the anchor and stuff."
104254,Gerritt,2007-08-16 12:05:00,6129,"It already has a hatch in the Bow Rick... these pictures dont show it though,.,, but this one does..     Gerritt."
104255,BITEME,2007-08-16 12:07:00,1969,NICE!!!!!!
104257,dustink,2007-08-16 12:15:00,526,Very nice....  dk
104263,bowshep,2007-08-16 12:23:00,378,So Your Bud did make you Wizer. Great work Nice and clean too. Peace Ken
104265,Sherriff,2007-08-16 12:30:00,252,Looks very nice.  Great job. Not sure if I missed it or not but I would put a bilge in her if I were you.  My brother added one to his and it was an easy addition as well as not too much $'s.  Just added safety too...  Sherriff
104272,Gerritt,2007-08-16 12:53:00,6129,"  I do have a bilge... but for it to be effective I would need to mount in the centre of the boat @ the transom (due to the ""V"").. Meaning it is in my way...  My solution was to put the Bilge on Alligator clips for the time being (until I put in a full floor) and make it a portable unit.... so I am not stepping on it etc....  Once I get the floor in I will make is a permanent fixture.   Gerritt."
104284,wuchikubo,2007-08-16 13:17:00,1114,Looks Great! Keep up the good work.
104302,BFSC Kevin,2007-08-16 13:39:00,1351,"looking good there.. very clean... i need to fix mine up.. i only did a quick job in the summer when i didnt have to much time, now next week, i will, and fix er up.  but for me, i followed lew's advice, i put the trolling motor at the very tip and stuck the bow lights behind it, but the lights were removable and and had like a 10inch shaft. let me see if i can find lew's picture...  once again, very nice, gerrit.  cheers"
104304,BFSC Kevin,2007-08-16 13:41:00,1351,here's a pic that lew posted he posted a few weeks back about holding the lures but then this also shows his bow lights with the trolling motor infront.. i hope lew is alright with me reposting this...  
104308,fishnsled,2007-08-16 13:45:00,3520,Looking GREAT!!!
104310,Bly,2007-08-16 13:50:00,1556,Looking good Gerritt!!  Enjoy and hopefully you can get it finished and out in the water soon
104315,Jen,2007-08-16 14:03:00,833,"Nice job G, can't wait to see you out there in her catching fish...  Cheers  Jen"
104342,Garyv,2007-08-16 15:35:00,547,See you have provrn again that 1/2 the fun of purchasing a new boat is working on it to make it better!
104347,misfish,2007-08-16 15:46:00,29133,"The Bud was a nice touch. Now Im thirsty.LOL  Look,n good bro."
104361,bucketmouthjohnny,2007-08-16 16:43:00,115,"Gerritt, looks great, especially that brown bottle   one thing i noticed about the trolling motor, is there enough support for the bracket mount? or are you just screwed into the thin aluminum? if so, depending on lakes to be fished, you might want to beef up that mounting area with some thicker alum or a steel plate. How high are you bringing the floor up? are you going to put an elevated front casting platform? Keep up the good work!!!!  ps, also with the power dive trolling motor, you might want to support the collar close to the head so it doesn't bounce/flex and possibly crack. A lot of guys with kotas use a ram mount, not sure what type though."
104367,huntervasili,2007-08-16 16:55:00,1604,starting to look good eh man.... betcha itll look even betten on the water
104375,canadianguy33,2007-08-16 17:24:00,121,Nice boat!
104378,Vanselena,2007-08-16 17:33:00,269,"I gutted mine and took pics along the way, hope these pics help you!  I made a mistake on the end and had to put a metal c-channel on top to bring it right to the boat rib. These beams are simply metal stud reinforcement pieces rivited back to back.                        "
104403,addict,2007-08-16 19:06:00,475,"lookin good bro.cant wait to tune mine up,gonna build a huge casting deck.goes from the middle seat to the front,"
104462,Gerritt,2007-08-17 00:00:00,6129,"  Hi,  What you really cant see in the pictures is the trolling motor is mounted on a piece of 5/8"" Marine Grade Plywood... Under the aluminium of the front is 3/4"" plywood what was installed @ the factory... a few over sized washers and she is solid   I should also mention that I put rubber washers between the quick release plate and the plywood. It acts as a bit of a shock absorber. I will be looking into a way of securing the ""head"" of the motor as well.... I never bothered on the old boat... but why chance it I figure..    I have made a decision on how the floor will be secured as well... 2x2 Aluminium Angle, w/ 2x2 square Tube Aluminium for cross bracing. The angle will be placed on the front and middle benches secured with Structural steel epoxy and 3/4"" SS Screws. This epoxy is insane.. and is actually used in structural application where it bears ALOT of weight... it is also used in the manufacture of Airplanes etc.. it is not cheap but effective...And weather tolerant. If anyone wants more info I will be more then happy to give out the supplier...  I am thinking 5/8"" Marine grade for the floor... to help keep weight down... the base will be strong enough where it will not be flexing.  Gerritt."
104484,fishindevil,2007-08-17 01:12:00,6254,"The boat is looking good gerritt !!!!!!!   you will have her all rigged out in no time at all,keep up the good /hard work....cheers"
104551,Bernie,2007-08-17 11:51:00,3190,Hey Gerritt. Its coming along well.   Hope you are getting some time on the water with it. Anything I can help with let me know.
