Turns out their method of catching them is poaching!!!

104397,canadianguy33,2007-08-16 18:43:00,121,lol funny story.  Thanks for sharing.
104408,Jay T,2007-08-16 19:16:00,282,"I have seen this too many times in rivers for salmon, and got into many arguments cause they were using huge treble hooks and snagging them. Well needless to say some went for a swim in the river."
104418,misfish,2007-08-16 19:39:00,29133,"Ah the ones with all the money and no brains.LOL   Yep got to love the guys with the #1 treb,dress with yarn eh.Oh the fun of it all."
104424,Golfisher,2007-08-16 19:43:00,586,Hilarious!
104425,canadian_copper,2007-08-16 19:44:00,925,"TYPICAL RETARDS!!!! LIKE FORREST GUMPS MOM SAID ""STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES "" LOL"
104433,banger,2007-08-16 20:02:00,95,"    When I river fished in the past ( I don't any more) I would see countless jerks doing the same thing!  It would always end with me losing my cool.I would sit there all day, for maybe a hit.And these S.O.B's would be snagging anything that they saw.   At least I had the enjoyment of seeing a couple of guys get caught infront of a MNR one time.      Some people just don't get it."
104434,blaque,2007-08-16 20:02:00,2419,"Been reading about this on another forum for a couple days, it is amazing indeed. They should be fined just for their corny behavior. Id slap those two even without the poaching. The video is no longer up on Youtube, but those that saw it in full would agree im sure that they were completely obnoxious and idiotic individuals."
104436,misfish,2007-08-16 20:08:00,29133, PRICELESS This is why I fish the river when its cold enough to freeze the brass monkeys ???? off.  You dont see these clowns then.
104438,banger,2007-08-16 20:15:00,95,"That would be the best time of the year to fish.  The cold does tend to leave to dude's at home with Mommy.It's to bad, my taste for river fishing is fouled. ( no pun intended lol)"
104445,mcallister.grant,2007-08-16 20:38:00,327,Idiots!
104488,Douger,2007-08-17 01:24:00,116,"it's amazing to think that there are so many anglers who care deeply about the sport and species, and then there are these yahoos who are either unbelievably ignorant, or who just don't care, and that we share the same oxygen."
104493,knotaclue,2007-08-17 01:44:00,136,i'v seen it happen in my own back yard ! what pisses me off is when they tell you they have the right to be there 
104516,BrownTown,2007-08-17 02:54:00,103,i dont even know what to say..............
104530,redx,2007-08-17 04:09:00,60,It would be nice to have a Steelhead river behind my house! To bad that place is going to waste... Btw I have never seen CO/MNR near the river on a salmon or steelhead run.
