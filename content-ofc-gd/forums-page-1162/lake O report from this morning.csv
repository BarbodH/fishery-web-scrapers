104389,snagmaster,2007-08-16 18:28:00,250,"hey all, iceguy and I hit lake O this morning to get some kings . We left it till last minute to decide if we were going in the morn cause the weatherman was calling for 30 to 50km winds starting soon after 6 am. Rob checked out the radar and a few other weather sites and figured we could get a few hours trolling in before the winds picked up....He was right ...it was a gorgeous morning. I got the first fish at 8am 50 feet down ..nice fish just shy of 20lb.  we trolled for an hour with nothing and then bumped into 2 shakers. Right after the shakers rob got this chinook also just under 20lb.  we still had calm conditiond and it was 930am. 20 min later a good one hit and poped off. I got the last fish around 1030. a fiesty 11lber. . the weather man kept lots of people off the lake today but it was a beauty. goodluck on the water"
104391,ccmtcanada,2007-08-16 18:30:00,7971,Wow....some beautiful fish!!  Glad the winds held off...they a howling out there now!
104394,Smokey,2007-08-16 18:38:00,1278,Nice fish Congrats. I would never depend on the word of the weather man as there almost always wrong. Best judge is to get up and stick your head outside and make your own decision.  Thanks for the report and pics.
104395,misfish,2007-08-16 18:39:00,29133,Nice fish guys.I have heard this Iceguy knows his fish.LOL  Great report.
104400,addict,2007-08-16 18:53:00,475,those weather guys are usually wrong.the only thing they usually predict is very large storms.nice work on those kings.pretty soon they will be close to the piers where i and my cleo can get a stab at a few.

104440,tbayboy,2007-08-16 20:21:00,1497,"The weather guys have been pretty bad all summer.  Glad to hear you got out, some nice fish there.  They say sunny on Saturday without much wind so I figure thunderstorms and 40k winds at least."
104442,mcallister.grant,2007-08-16 20:27:00,327,Nice fish! Glad the winds held off for you guys!
104481,iceguy,2007-08-17 01:08:00,341,"Glad you made it out with me today Al. Not always do they get it right on the forcast, that's why the 5 A.M game time decision is some time neccesary to make or break a fishing day. Blue zone next week with the six rod spread for some steelhead,coho and some open water chinnok's. Here's some video of today's event's enjoy.  "
