104808,segment,2007-08-17 23:26:00,5,"I'm a big fisherman whom goes on fly-in fishing trips every year for pike/walleye.  I used to Salmon fish Lake Ontario every week on our 22 foot boat for 6 years back in the 90s with my father.  Currently my wife and I don't have a boat because our new house is being built and therefore don't have a place for a boat otherwise I'd purchase one tomorrow.  The boat is going to have to come next year for us.  I'm currently looking for anyone around the Barrie area (or within 100km) whom owns a boat or would like to go halves on some boat rentals and would like a fishing buddy.  I will split gas and any other costs that are incurred.  My hours are very flexible as I am the president of my own business - just let me know when and where.  Send me a PM if interested.  Thanks for reading,  Ryan"
