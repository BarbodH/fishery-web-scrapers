I was kinda hoping to get out this weekend to try a couple of spots a 100 bass boats flying around the lake might mess that up."
104632,Jay T,2007-08-17 15:12:00,282,  Top Bass is holding the event. My buddy and I will be there with the rest of them at the starting line.

104653,ccmtcanada,2007-08-17 15:41:00,7971, Thanks for the heads up on this one.  A quick visit to their website shows winnings are based on 120 boats entering.  Think I'll skip the bog this weekend!!!
104659,misfish,2007-08-17 15:57:00,29133, Which one?
104702,jedimaster,2007-08-17 17:50:00,3472,"Top Bass, I will have my binoculars out spotting for holes and lures."
104706,Jay T,2007-08-17 18:04:00,282," Note to self, watch for guy with binos and sneaky grin. LOL  As far as I am aware, I don't think you can enter this late. I could be wrong.  As for lures make them up like Roy did, they work great  ."
104708,jedimaster,2007-08-17 18:13:00,3472,From what I was told there was lots of space left and Top Bass you can enter the day of at the launch. Not 100 percent sure if I will enter on Saturday but I am about 90 percent sure I will be out on the lake to see where people fish. I am new to scugog and wanted to see where everyone goes.
104711,jedimaster,2007-08-17 18:20:00,3472,Besides I will be in disguise so you won't know its me.  
104713,Jay T,2007-08-17 18:47:00,282,"Well if you enter good luck, sorry can't help with good spots gotta keep them to myself you know how it is. I am sure you will see where everyone goes."

104720,jedimaster,2007-08-17 19:09:00,3472,Where is the launch area? Just wanna stay out of the way on saturday morning. I know what its like launching 100 boats while everyone is still half asleep.
