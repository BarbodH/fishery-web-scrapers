We are launching from Bisco onto the main lake and wingin it for 7 days and im a little aprehensive about finding a camping spot on the lake that will hold 4 tents comfortablly. But like always it always works out. Guess im just looking for tips on catching pickeral the pike and maybe even a few lake trout ta boot. Does anyone have a map that they could send me?  as im going in totally blind... Bags are packed, boats ready for launch and i'm pumped   Cheers, sturgman"

104855,TennesseeGuy,2007-08-18 01:32:00,957,Do a search for lots of good information.  It looks like a nice lake with plenty of good fishing water to explore.  Have a good trip and let us know how it went.
104885,DebS,2007-08-18 03:11:00,56,"Hi Sturgman, We fished Bisco a few years ago & it's an amazing lake. It was a bit overwhelming because it's so big & we didn't have a fishfinder at the time, but just fished a lot of good looking structure & were able to catch some nice walleyes.  Don't think you'll have any trouble finding a camping spot. Here's a link to a map of the lake (It's from Grey Owl Camps' website) & it's pretty accurate. Good luck & show us pictures when you return!  http://www.duenorth.net/greyowl/cabins.html"
