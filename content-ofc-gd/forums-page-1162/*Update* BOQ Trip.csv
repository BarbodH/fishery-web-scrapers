I've basically narrowed it down to a couple places, The Sportsmen Motel in Picton or the Bayside Motel in Trenton, basically my question now is fishing wise, which would be the better locales? We'll be targetting a mix of fish between pickeral, bass and northern's.. Is one location better than the other?  Lastly, has anyone stayed at either of these places and can you offer anything good or bad on either of them??  Thanks!  Andrew."
