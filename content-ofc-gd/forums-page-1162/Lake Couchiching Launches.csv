104973,mart,2007-08-18 18:08:00,93,I was wondering if anyone knows of some boat launches on Couch close to Washago or anywhere near the north end of the lake. Any help would be appreciated.. Thanks

See ya in the morning.  Cold front and winds for the last 3 days put a real hurt on the bite today.Lots of 1, and 2, fish weighed in.We managed 5 for 7.Sad day.Wind was a killer out there. Used up every bit of power I had for the trolling motor today."
105066,mart,2007-08-19 01:21:00,93,Thanks for the replies. Brian I'll probably launch out of Orillia too. I'll look for you in the morning to say hi. To bad the fishing wasn't to good for you at the Pool. Hopefully Couch is better to you..
