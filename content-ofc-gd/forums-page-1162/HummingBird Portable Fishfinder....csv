Mainly, driving at any speed above trolling speed renders my screen blank or completely incorrect. My transducer has taken a bit of a beating over the past 5 years, its still in tact, just pretty scraped up on the underside. Would this be the root of my problems? Anyone have the same unit? How much should a new transducer run me?? Thanks."
