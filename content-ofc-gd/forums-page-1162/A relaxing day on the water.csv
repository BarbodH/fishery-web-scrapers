He arrived Wed. night and Thurs morning we went out and got him a fishing lisence.  I called Beans and asked if he was able to take Tim fishing and I would visit my mom.  Beans had already made plans for the day but told me to come and use his boat....so we did  This was the first time Tim had fished in a few years so I was really looking forward to it, but, I hadn't operated a boat for even longer, other than a short stint at Lakair...we were in for an adventure   Arrived at my moms to pick up the key for the boat lock and were off by noon.  Got to our first spot, and right of the bat I had a small Rock Bass, not long after Tim had an even bigger one.  We were looking to have some fun, not so much for size, although we wouldn't have complained  .  After those two, nada.  Off we went to a spot Beans and I have done well at before, and not even a line bump.  We decied to head back towards home and try a spot or two on the way.  Now remember anytime I've fished Pigeon Lake, Beans was always the driver.  I get to a spot I think I know, Tim drops in his line and Bam and small bass hits right away...cool....not...nothing else happened no matter what we put out there...oh well time for food and a bit of a visit with my mom and Beans.  Start heading in, or so I though and realized I'm not where I thought I was    .  Look around and finally realize where I am...no where near where I thought I was    I figured out how to get back, start heading in and then I hear...sputter sputter, cough cough...Dang, we're out of gas..hmmm Tim might have to do a bit of rowing   ...thankfully there was a bit of gas in the jerry can, filled up and we were off like a herd of turtles with the 4hp .  Made our way safely back and enjoyed a nice lunch and visit with the folks and headed for home.  All in all a good day.  Thanks Beans!!!"
