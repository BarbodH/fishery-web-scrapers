They have all the usual stuff including some of the gear to get started but they don't really get into what to look for in gear and why. I have been doing mostly bass fishing so this is a new area for me.  Hopefully I can benefit once again from the accumulated knowledge of this board.  So what are the qualities of a good muskie rod and reel, what are the features that I should look for and what should should I avoid?  Right now pricing and brands aren't that important since like many sports ideal equipment is very much a personal choice, someone might be happy with a $50 dollar setup while another might spend $300 and feel the price was worth every penny."

When I was looking for mine, I was more concerned with find one that could handle the heavy lures. Finally decided on an Ugly Stik Tiger Lite with a 1-5 oz. lure weight, it was only $60 and I can't wait to catch my first Mucksie on it!!!"
105081,Pigeontroller,2007-08-19 02:11:00,2793,"There are 3 basic types of Muskie rods, Bucktail,Jerkbait and trolling. If you're just getting started you can use one rod for everything...A good bet for a do everything rod would be a Shimano Compre 7 foot  1-3 oz. Buctail rods are typical 7 1/2 to 8 feet with a lure rating of 1-3 oz. Jerkbait rods are generally shorter, about 6-7 feet, with a lure weight rating of 2-5 oz. For trolling a glass composite rod in whatever length you prefer with a lure weight rating anywhere from 2-8 oz."
