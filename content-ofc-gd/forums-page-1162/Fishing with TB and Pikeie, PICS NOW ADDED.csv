104466,tinbanger,2007-08-17 00:12:00,1028,"After backing my own boat into the steel dock on Sunday ( not to much damage , nick on motor housing ,broken screw on corner plate ) the Follies continued last night.  Got home a bit early ,Pikeie had the boat and gear ready to go .Headed off to the only Launch left open in Barrie as the Tiffen launch is closed weekdays as they continue to work on the waterfront .  Pulled into the Barrie Marina to see two big Tunnel boats getting ready to launch and two more cars in front of me ( $%#@) But no one seems to be moving! 1/2 dozen people standing on the dock looking into the water . So I head over to see whats going on and what do I see but the top of the roof and the open hood of a new new shiney Tacoma P/U WAAAYYY into the water .  Apparently Backing up to launch your seadoo's and talking on your cell is NOT a good idea.  One of the Tunnel boats guys yanked him and his truck out .Amazingly the guy seemed rather calm and cool ( maybe a bit damp)  Pikeie has pics on hi scell that we will post later.  Fished around the water front for an hour or so as we waited on my wife and younger son to meet up with us after she finished work .  Son brought along a friend so we were a bit tight with 5 in the boat but lake was calm so we took a run out of the bay . Tried a few spots and had good success in 8-15 FOW plastics and cranks worked well. All had fish in the boat .  Will update with pics and maybe a truck for sale !  TB"
