I know that the fishery has had its problems in the past, and I believe its a catch and release ONLY fishery now. Just wondering if its worth the effort of making the trip to Otter."
93649,addy79,2007-07-13 14:16:00,573,sorry..... shameless bump!!
93651,ilario,2007-07-13 14:37:00,166,"I have heard that the SM bass fishing is decent there...sorry, can't help youwith the other species, but my guess is that the lakers and walleye would be harder to come by, like most Muskoka lakes...walleye especially can be hard to get up there  good luck"
100624,ibsublime,2007-08-03 14:57:00,2,"No walleye... I know, hard to believe.  Lots of big lakers... you'll need down riggers.  Try the deepest water just south of Tapatoo.. approx 180ft.  Lots of big Pike and SM... when they feel like biting.  PLEASE CATCH AND RELEASE  Good luck!  (see attached monster 5lb'er from late last summer.  Caught on a 1/4"" piece of worm) (lots of crayfish in the lake ; )) "

104667,ibsublime,2007-08-17 16:25:00,2,Too bad I'm behind the camera... not holding the fish : (  I was only able to land a few energetic small mouth under 2lb on sanco's.  I'll be venturing out on some of the neighboring lakes over the next few years.... maybe we'll cross lines.  Cheers!
104671,addy79,2007-08-17 16:35:00,573,"I'm right next door to Otter, will be heading there in the next month to troll for lakers via canoe and leadcore. Im hitting lakes all over that area, so yeah maybe! tight lines!"
104734,ilario,2007-08-17 19:48:00,166,"are there decent numbers of lakers in Otter or is it hit and miss... i fish mostly Haliburton lakes for lakes and they;re ok, but can be tough at times..fish are usually small"
104754,addy79,2007-08-17 20:30:00,573,"from what i've learnt its pretty bad there. in fact, the general store nearby has a donation box to help rebuild the laker trout population there."
