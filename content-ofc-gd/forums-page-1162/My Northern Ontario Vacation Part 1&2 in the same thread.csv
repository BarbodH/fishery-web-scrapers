104211,Jen,2007-08-16 03:44:00,833,"Well Mike, what to say, so much racing through my head...  Firstly, Congrats to Ryan for his very nice, very big first Walleye!  Way to go!  Now onto you... what a wonderful vacation... In hindsight, looking back I bet you are smiling even now.  Not only did you get to wash out your tackle box, you got rid of everything you probably never use.  Educated a great number of Boy Scouts, made a couple of scout leaders very proud of themselves and their recovery skills and probably will be talked about around boy scout camp fires for ages to come.  You taught yourself a lesson... being well prepared, calm and quick minded can actually save your life!  Well done, you should be very proud of yourself.  The camp grounds look awesome and what a terrific view...  Like always, I enjoy your reports... but your pictures speak volumes!  Can't wait to hook up with you and yours again at Pickeral Park sometime.  Cheers  Jen"
104977,Mike the Pike,2007-08-18 18:26:00,3421,Well thanks for all the great comments and support folks .After the mishap I actually went fishing in my brother inlaws 12 foot tinny in Northern Quebec minus my 8hp Yamaha which I am still  trying to start.Brought the electric motor and this got us around the lake boy the thought of capsizing went through my mind numerous times the fishing sucked but I did manage to catch a little smally before the cold front; I will post a report soon of my trip up North.I will have to replace my net to me the rubber nets are the best for now I have my old net.My fish finder works but LCD screen is only showing a week image hopefully it will come back with time.I am now shopping around for a new camera I only buy Canon camera's and I don't need anything fancy as the wife has a Canon Rebel EOS XT.I am looking to replace my A530 with a Canon A570 for now I am using my daughters HP photo smart.In all the boat flipping  mishap will cost me about $500 but I am just glad to be still breathing.Good to be back online our computer was down for 3 days due to a virus  Man I was really missing OFC.  Ryan and I are going out in the morning in the comfort and safety of my much bigger Lund.Hopefully we will have something to report.  Mike the Pike
103294,ccmtcanada,2007-08-13 11:27:00,7971,"Wow Mike....Excellent report!  Apart from the boat thing and the trip to the hospital, it looks like you had a great time.  Kids always outfish me as well, so I know exactly how you feel on that one. You have some incredible pictures...and I know your kids have some great memories of these trips you take with them.  You better buy about a dozen of those pink x raps...if you ever go out and you dont have enough for the kids, you'll be in deep trouble...LOL.  Thanks Mike...I enjoyed reading about your trip!"
103307,motv8tr,2007-08-13 11:53:00,2587,"Wow, now that's a heck of a report, and I'm sure quite the adventure!  Glad you were wearing your PFD!!!  It's always a good trip when the kids outfish you too   Glad you were able to recover the pics from your camera, those were some great photos, and I've no doubt some great memories for all.  Maureen"
103309,scuro,2007-08-13 11:57:00,386,"I read your story and then told my wife about it and we shared it over coffee. She enjoyed it too, especially the part about the Ukrainian scouts coming to the rescue. She plays scrabble with me and I have done stupid things on a boat so we could both relate. We also rent a cabin every year not far from the park. I know that area well and have canoed through it. I've never tipped a boat but then again the smallest boat I've rented was a 14ft., given the opportunity I'm sure I would have done it by now. I've had several rods go overboard and can strongly recommend the more expensive rods with cork in the handle.  You had some lovely pics, glad the camera was saved. I look back on mine from that time period and cherish them everytime I see them. Electronics are not automatically ruined if they are submerged. The big mistake that most make is that they turn on the unit and short it out because there is still water inside. Open all the compartments and wait ten days. You would be surprised how often electronics can be saved. Did I mention I went in the drink with my cell phone?"
103311,Smokey,2007-08-13 12:04:00,1278,"Great report Mike. Lesson learned about the life jacket for me in the small boat now, you where lucky. I'll be wearing mine for sure when in the small boat alone.  Thanks for the pics and report. As for being outfished by the kids, I bet you couldn't think of anyone else you'd rather be outfished by."
103323,dustink,2007-08-13 12:40:00,526,"Great report.  Glad everything turned out OK with the flipped boat.....could of turned bad, quick!  Good for wearing your PDF.  Looks like the kids had a great time!  dk"
103336,lunkerbasshunter,2007-08-13 13:40:00,2585,glad you came out ok from the boat tip over.  Good on you for wearing a life jacket.  Cheers!
103341,Gerritt,2007-08-13 13:43:00,6129,Mike..... What an adventure brother! Just glad your home safe and sound with nothing hurt (except perhaps your pride?) LOL!  Good thing you had your wits about you or thing could have been much worse! You had an angel watching you for sure...  I love the pic of your daughter with the frogs... CLASSIC!  Being out fished by your buddies sucks... Being out fished by your kids is priceless!!  High-Five to your son on his first walleye!  Gerritt.
103349,tbayboy,2007-08-13 14:09:00,1497,"Wow, quite the adventure Mike.  Amazing how something as little as changing a lure can turn into a disaster so quickly.  Glad to see the rest of the trip worked out well - now I gotta go get me some pink x-raps."
103351,MJL,2007-08-13 14:13:00,2427,"Great report Mike.  Good to see kids having fun in the outdoors.  If that frog didn't turn out to be a prince, I'm sure he would be would stew up real well with the right ingredients."
103428,mepps,2007-08-13 19:02:00,1301,Great report and photos - thanks for sharing!
103432,canadianguy33,2007-08-13 19:12:00,121,Wow!  Glad to hear you hear you made out okay with the boat flip and all.  At least you saved the pics.
103493,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-13 22:08:00,0,Excellant report! Looks like you guys caught alot of fish and had a great time. That sucks about the tackle box though. You dont look like a happy camper at all in the pic.lol  You sure brought up alot of tackle!
103505,PERCHER,2007-08-13 22:48:00,787,"So Mike did Robins frog turn into a prince?If it did I dont think you would of had room for him in the van anyways.Who wants a green prince anyway.Well your home safe and sound ,lesson learned and the kids had a blast.thats all that matters.Dan"
103579,scuro,2007-08-14 02:12:00,386,"I've read hundreds and hundreds of reports on several boards over five years of active cruising. This one stuck in my mind the whole day, it's a classic. If someone says small boat, I'll think of your misadventure off the bat. ""No way I am getting into that boat with the weather forecast predicting ""WIND"".  Such is life, we all live through bad things at some point that seem like such a disaster in the moment. Your wife will never forget that trip either. I also did something I never do, I bought a lure based on a report. I've got my pink x-rap."
103583,huntervasili,2007-08-14 02:37:00,1604,WTG there mike looks like ya had some fun even with the mishap... Glad to hear you got out of that okay and have your memory card for your camera too...
103585,caper,2007-08-14 02:40:00,210,"Excellent report, thanks for taking the time to put it together for us."
103935,ehg,2007-08-15 03:27:00,2666,"Great report, luckily your alright, all those other things can be replaced. Good to get away with the kids!  cheers,  ehg"
104186,solopaddler,2007-08-16 01:48:00,8605,"Great report Mike! Just got back from the cabin earlier tonight. The scrabble pic is more fitting than you think, I had the in laws up this time and we had a marathon every night  ."
104210,Tacklebuster,2007-08-16 03:41:00,303,What an awesome report.  Thank goodness everything turned out well.  I guess you got a few more memories than you expected.  After reading your report I am going to be thinking of my upcoming trip to Six Mile every day for the next two weeks.
