The pike are still in our shallow bays, so casting big baits or flat-line trolling has worked well, at any speed.  Most always predictable and really agressive.   They attack anything right now.  The weeds are premature enough that they aren't much of a nusiance.  The ice-out on our lake was April 26, so the Pickerel have had a later spawn, and we have seen them transition in massive schools after the opener around the deep ledges of the river narrows.  Try catching them now in the main lake.  With the thousands of black flies the past couple weekends, and lock jaw from the unstable weather, it's been challenging, and nothing substantial.  Haven't seen any extensive late spring mayfly hatch, so they can't be that full of it!  I will leave that report for another cottage weekend.  Good luck everyone!  DiscoPhish"

It could be that, if you are driving the boat, you are such a skilled driver and observer of fish structure, that you do such a magnificant job putting your partner on the biggest of fish.  Great job on this one ... very respectable fish.  Congrats."

211815,selcram,2008-06-06 14:49:00,26,"Hello!  Discophish told me last night he posted this!  I have to agree, as captain of the boat, he can totally take all the credit!     Not for just putting us in the right spot but for insisting we throw two more casts!  I was ready to cut our losses and make a bee line for the cottage before we lost more blood from the black flies ( thick, dense clouds! felt like it anyways LOL ) but sure enough, on the second and last cast!  bam! this beauty hit!  Thanks Discophish!  again!"
