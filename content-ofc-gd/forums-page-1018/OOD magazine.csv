211571,Nemo,2008-06-06 01:24:00,727,Wow I knew I was in good hands here.
211583,danbouck,2008-06-06 02:04:00,4380,I believe Ramble On is the one releasing the pike.  There was also a great read on Boat Launch Ethics in there. I wanted to post it but couldn't find an online version. GCD would have liked it.
211659,JustinHoffman,2008-06-06 09:47:00,482,"Hello All,  Thanks for the kind words regarding OOD and myself - it is an affiliation I am both proud and honoured to be a part of.  As for working with TJ - we've been partnered up for close to a decade now, and I appreciate and hold close the working and personal relationship we've formed. Thanks, bud...  As for 'baby-face' Justin - yep, that photo was a couple of years old! haha  As a side note - I am writing this post as I sit in sunny Greece, visiting my brother who resides here. Right now I am in the mountainous region of Northern Greece, sitting on the border of Macedonia. Beautiful scenery abounds! Off to Corfu come Tuesday...  Will be back in Ottawa a few days before bass season commences..  Here's wishing everyone a safe and fruitful fishing season.  Justin"
211736,Moosebunk,2008-06-06 13:17:00,3970,"It's great.  More and more familiar faces there all the time.  But why not... afterall, it's Ontario anglers and hunters that make Ontario OutofDoors come to life."
211794,Reef Runner,2008-06-06 14:29:00,981,"  Yup, I stand corrected, thanks Dan. I knew he looked familiar, just couldn't put a handle on the face...lol."
211848,radar,2008-06-06 15:33:00,138,I found this site through a google search on walley eI believe and coming across Justin's articles 6(+?) years ago and following the links.
211874,largemouth,2008-06-06 16:03:00,112,"Tim and Justin are active posters on other fishing sites too, hope they start posting here as much once bass season opens."
