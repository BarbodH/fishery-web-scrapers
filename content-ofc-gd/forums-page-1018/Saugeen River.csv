I did some research and the river apparently holds bass, pike, specks, browns, rainbows and salmon. Are these trout strictly migratory or are there residents to be had? Neither one of us know much about this river. Any tips and/or insight would be amazing."
211783,Raf,2008-06-06 14:14:00,3495,"there be muskie in them waters too.  nice river to fish.  best bet is to have two cars, put in with a canoe up river then float down to car #2.  upper reaches hold res. trout."
211785,Billy - Curtiss,2008-06-06 14:17:00,241,"Cool. I actually just checked out a map, and I think we may actually fish Rocky Saugeen rather than the main river. I'm not sure if that's any better or not."
211787,Raf,2008-06-06 14:20:00,3495,"if i'm not mistaken, the rocky is in the upper stretches.  i personally have only fished the 'geen closer to l. huron (walkerton -> l. huron), so i don't have any specific info for you.  just grab a canoe and go.. at worst you spend a day floatin' on the river (bring the banjo )"
211791,highdrifter,2008-06-06 14:25:00,2534,"Brotha..  It's a world class smallmouth fishery, and they lluuuuvv top water baits.  Too bad opener is still a ways away..  teehhhee  Whats the good word for tonight homay?  H to the D"
211798,Raf,2008-06-06 14:34:00,3495,H to the D.  the word is I'm illn'  (not in good way either)  yah i realize you're talking to the billy.
211812,Spiel,2008-06-06 14:46:00,9065,"....The ""Rocky"" is strictly specks and browns with lots and lots of posted land. I'm very familiar with the Markdale area and if you get land owner permission you should find the fishing fairly good."
211818,ehg,2008-06-06 14:53:00,2666,"The area around Markdale is a brook trout haven. The Rocky Saugeen to the west around Traverston is incredible for brookies. The Beaver River near Kimberley and upstream is great for brookies, all the little branches of river in the area have brookies. Get some # 2 Panther Martins and you should be good to go.  ehg"
211819,Billy - Curtiss,2008-06-06 14:57:00,241, Nice! I'm doing a BBQ at the neighbors across the street so I reckon I'll be good and liquored and ready for bed by 10:00 PM! I've got some caribou tenderloin tips that I'm about to marinade in a nice Côtes du Rhône syrah and shallots and I'm a gonna skewer those bad boys right up. My mouth is watering already!
211821,Billy - Curtiss,2008-06-06 15:00:00,241, Awesome! Thanks for the heads up. I'm really looking forward to this journey! Is the Rocky navigable by canoe?
211827,Spiel,2008-06-06 15:10:00,9065, Not exactly. Lot's of log jams and boggy bottom areas. Oh and you'll find plenty of hungry skeeters.
211830,ehg,2008-06-06 15:15:00,2666,"Not around Markdale i don't think, maybe from town of Durham downstream but i dunno. Good luck up there anyways."
211853,highdrifter,2008-06-06 15:41:00,2534," No worries.  I shoulda made that homay(s)..  Get better son.  No better therapy than a little bait polishing session, a litle Queens and some chicken noodle soop..  HD"
211866,highdrifter,2008-06-06 15:55:00,2534," Duude!  What a koinkidink..  I've got some moose tenderlon thawing on the counter..

211871,Raf,2008-06-06 16:00:00,3495,"thanks HD, i'm getting better.  hope to spend sime time with the girls (stellas), maybe a little 'gardening' and some queens for sure.  those moose steaks sounds mighty good though!! come on by haha"
