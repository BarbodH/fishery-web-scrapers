212293,shane,2008-06-07 15:27:00,652,I don't know of much going on in the Maitland R. until bass season opens.  Maybe try for perch off the pier.
212358,Canuck2fan,2008-06-07 21:37:00,1444,+1 for fishing for perch off the pier where all the other fisher persons are..... Don't forget to pack a lunch because you likely aren't going to catch it. You might get lucky though and nail a few.  Stay out of the river until bass opens though because in reality you are just messing up the spawn if you fish the river.
