211914,Stoty,2008-06-06 18:26:00,2910,Not a bad idea....  Cardboard Cops
211917,anders,2008-06-06 18:33:00,1168,Pretty cool.  It will probably work for a while then lose its luster
211921,Reef Runner,2008-06-06 18:42:00,981,"Maybe they'll show up to the court room to, lol."
211922,Stoty,2008-06-06 18:43:00,2910,Or Timmy's......
211923,ketchenany,2008-06-06 18:43:00,3229,"Many years ago on my way to Detroit the OPP had the same thing happening, but it was an empty cruiser on the side of the road. I passed two empty and the third was manned and getting the people who were ticked at having to slow down for the first two."
211925,Stoty,2008-06-06 18:44:00,2910," hahahaha, nice!"
211933,johnnyb,2008-06-06 19:08:00,3413,Not a bad idea at all....
211980,danbo,2008-06-06 20:33:00,2646,If it saves one single LIFE it is great!  If You wanna race..get on a race track!
211986,Dondorfish,2008-06-06 20:46:00,1000,   LOL - They did the same thing on the 400 maybe 10 years ago. I watched a few cars go flying by me and get pulled over a couple of miles up the road. Guess they thought the 3rd one was empty too.  Don
212190,charlied,2008-06-07 02:57:00,584,I agree...there is absolutely no reason for people to speed.  Leave 10 minutes early.  It gets my blood boiling when I see minivan's go whipping by me at 140 klicks with kids in the back seat.  More people should think of safety of there children and other drivers.  GReat idea for the Cardboard police....LOL
212193,Tarzan's Jane,2008-06-07 03:07:00,1183,"Ya know...I knew of a girl who was driving fast...and on the phone to boot!!!   I'm sure other motorists are thinking the same as I...dumb a s s....but what I wasn't aware of until later, was that she was trying to keep up to a speeder who was driving erratically and was on the phone to 911 at the same time.  Needless to say the guy was surrounded at a stop light approximately 20 kms away. Got to love the communication our fine policemen have.  Maybe we should all go to Timmies.  and talk about life.."
212209,Carp,2008-06-07 03:52:00,1488,"If it slows 'em down, why not. They work for free too."
212229,brickNblock,2008-06-07 07:19:00,598,"Not highjacking your thread Stoty, just didnt want to start another on a close topic. I can remember in Murray, Kentucky years ago the game wardens installed cardboard deer on the side of some backroads. Problem they had was OOS poachers that shot from the window of their trucks....they'd capture these guys on video......BUSTED!"
