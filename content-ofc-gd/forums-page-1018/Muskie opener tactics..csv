211713,RangerGuy,2008-06-06 12:31:00,564,"Well.. My black cloud returns ... Tuesday night my truck stalled.. had to tow it home 13kms 140 bucks WHAT A RIP!  Get home no spark. So I change the distributor Wednesday after work.. started fine. After inspecting the condition of my distributor I figure that's gotta be the problem. Get home last night truck starts and runs great so I went to get gas for ""Old Smokey"" and the truck and it stalls again  I got lucky and coasted all the way home LOL! back in the driveway no spark at all... So I go to CT and get a coil.. change it still no spark.  My truck has a MSD Ignition Multi Spark Discharge unit after doing some suggested manufacture tests it appears that this is the problem  This weekend is off.. I will have to wait until next weekend."
211754,Squid,2008-06-06 13:33:00,1656,"That sucks Ranger Guy. I am heading up to the Kawarthas tomorrow to do the ""milk run"" should be great. Hoepfully there is some wind to hide us from those muskies especially if it is sunny outside. Slow presentation if these fishes have just finished spawning. I am going to start shallow and go deeper through the day. If casting does not produce then I will be trolling for them. I have seen muskies in less than 2 feet of water on a sandy beach warming them selves so don't be afraid of casting close to shore with a topwater bait."
211768,BillM,2008-06-06 13:50:00,17367,"I have about a million musky baits all new sitting in my tackle box waiting to be used.  Now the decision is, which bait gets the first toss of the season?  I REALLY wanna throw my new TopRaider, but I have a strange feeling the topwater bite isn't going to be great.  What's the first lure coming out of everyone's box?"

211837,Stoty,2008-06-06 15:20:00,2910,"I will have 4 rods rigged up.  1) Topwater - Chug Bug 2) Inline Spinner - #5 Mepps 3) Crankbait - J-13 jointed Rapala 4) Spinnerbait - 1/2 oz perch coloured  Being this is my first time Musky Fishing, I could be way off, but hey, gonna give'r a whirl!"
211865,ehg,2008-06-06 15:55:00,2666, The Chug Bug and 1/2 oz spinnerbait will catch alot of OOS bass. I'd stay away from them as you probably would have the leader deaden the action anyways. The J-13 and #5 inline spinner are better bets.
211896,MuskieWannabe,2008-06-06 17:00:00,79,First bait every year has to be a top raider over top of the most shallow weeds you can find.  Raised musky after musky my first 3 trips on the water last year.  Granted I lost a few of them but still nice to see them fly out of the water after them!  I'll be hitting the Mad (by Arnprior for you southern Ontario folks) and then the Rideau on Wednesday.

210278,Musky or Specks,2008-06-03 16:05:00,2710,I've been hitting the same lake every year for opener now for the past six years and we have found the fish to be on shallow rocky shorelines. We will fish a Doc at one end of the boat and a bulger type bucktail at the other. A Bomber LongA will also get wet. We have found that the musky really prefer the long slim profile at this time of the year.
210298,Stoty,2008-06-03 16:32:00,2910,"I have a wide assortment of bass/walleye cranks, would they be alright to use this year, considering things seem to be behind what they normally are on the water?  But at the same time....I am assuming that after todays rain, and the next few days of warm weather, they are going to be quite active. So, should I go with large baits instead?  How do you think the topwater bite is going to be?    1,000th post!"

Like most people I am going to start with large spinnerbaits and topwaters on the outside weed edges of shallow bays and flats.  Last weekend I spotted a few muskie in these areas while fishing for morning walleye.  In the afternoon I will likely head over to Pigeon lake and slow troll small 6-8"" inch lures in the upper 10 feet of the water column over the edges of the main lake basin.  If all else fails I will throw at some shoals that have produced for me in the past.  For those asking about water temps, on Sunday they ranged from 60-63 degrees on Buckhorn.  Good luck to everyone!!"

Going up there the past few weekends i have seen lots of little perch so i am going to try perch pattern Rapala crankbaits. I also have a orange bucktail and lot's of spinnerbaits.

I went to a high school reunion on opening night & had a much better time than I thought I would & stayed WAY too late. So, I went from the reunion, changed clothes & headed to the lake. We went 2/3 pounding the shallows with oversized spinnerbaits, TEP baits to be exact.  I'll do the same this year.  Oh yeah, my partner for opener this year is someone I met at that reunion, & Tuesday of opening week will be our first year together.  Kinda funny how Muskies & girls go together sometimes....."

209933,Crazyhook,2008-06-03 00:44:00,1154,well I am going against the grain here and will be starting out in deeper water on drop offs and mid lake humps. Still fish out deep and if you can find any bait the musky should be with them. Jerkbaits and big rubbers ( surprise!) will be getting the first call on the water this year. I usually have 15-20 new baits to throw on opener but this winter I spent most my extra cash in Florida and only have 4 new baits to get wet... Hit the water last weekend and the weed growth was aweful. Usually if you can find fresh green weeds on the opener you should be able to find some muskies... thats plan B for me. Packed my mini box this year of 20 baits and can't wait to hit the water.  This will be my first musky opener ever where I will be fishing in a kayak! heading out both Saturday and Sunday...

209970,Meely,2008-06-03 01:42:00,282,"Well,  Saturday, we are planning on hitting Simcoe, for half a day, for a final whitey assault. We headed out last Saturday and had another incredible day. Im still icing my wrist from all the hook-sets. Then, the boat goes back on the trailer and up to Pigeon we go. Pigeon Lake is my home lake and I can hardly wait to get out and hunt an essox or two.  We had some pretty kewl action for last year's opener. We were out for approximately 4 hours and managed to raise 11 ski's. No biters but a whole heap of fun just the same. 9 of the 11 fish rasied were all out of shallow water. This year we are going to continue trying a technique mentioned in a Muskie Oddeysey a few years back.........focus on ""chaos and turmoil""(basically anything different on the lake.....IE.....where fast water meets slower water etc). We began using this technique and had some fantastic results last year. Lure of casting choice chartreuse boo tail........deadly  We'll probably stick to the northern end of the lake......so...if you see a black lund with two burly ""eye-talians"" ( 1 in a Gilligan hat)........say HELLO !!

209991,ehg,2008-06-03 02:03:00,2666,"Have seen the musky charter guys on Kawarthas troll spinnerbaits on short lines, fast and near the top of the water, on openers over last 20 years or so...Near what would be well defined weedlines later in the summer. Usually they would zig zag around to pull the big spinnerbait near the surface and cover water. Never tried this technique myself, maybe this year."
210136,outllaw,2008-06-03 11:43:00,1232,imgoing to be shallow near warmer water outflow creeks for starters. running woodies in brighter patterns. reaction strikes are the norm in cooler waters. this year the waters cooler and not mixed yet. on st clair its boards and  smaller cranks. mmm this all could change in 1 hour if ya know muskies. dax has covered the ethical and safety issues. good thread gents.

I've searched quite a bit, but haven't found any hard info,  ie 50-58degrees - spawning, bring up your baits and go pickerel fishing  I hope the French is close to the 60 degree mark or over, if not I think it's going to be a very tough weekend."

209823,Handlebarz,2008-06-02 21:08:00,3790,"Well here in the trolling world we will be running 5"" and 6 1/4"" woodies on LSC I know I will have a special pearch on its a amazing color for me and many others along with some browns and other green color lures small is usually better this time of year but you have to let the fish tell ya what they want last season I had 50.25 hours in for the season before I banged one out and she was my PB 50 1/4"".  Starting shallow maybe 8' here and working to 12' maybe 14' if we dont contact anything we will be looking for new weeds that are holding pearch and other bait fish. Its key on a big lake like this with little structure to find the bait if you do you will find the musky are not far behind.  We will be running the lures up high in the morning on the boards and hope to contact some fish to let us know where they are. This time of year on the big open water is tricky last year we found out they were late with the spawn by 2 weeks for most fish here on LSC I dont think they are that late this year. If I did not have a boat full I would be casting some spots I have marked out and trying there but I think they might be holding late spawners so I will give it another week or two depending how the reports are from what I have heard they have been catching some big girls all spawned out and males still milking so that is a good sigh that the big girls are done lets just hope."
209832,smbhunter,2008-06-02 21:21:00,186,"With this being my first official muskie hunting season, this thread is very beneficial and an excellent idea. Of all the muskie I've caught, only 1 has been actually fishing for them, so this is going to be quite different and exciting for me. I've booked off the weekend from work well in advance so I could take part in my first muskie opener, and with the great information provided from this thread, I can't wait to get out there and catch some skies. I will post a report and hopefully some pics.  Thanks guys."

209854,Pigeontroller,2008-06-02 22:01:00,2793,"Good to see lots of enthusiasm for the upcoming Muskie season! I just hope everyone handles these very delicate fish with the utmost care! They may look big,mean and tuff, but they are very suseptible to post-release mortality if handled poorly! Please keep out of water time to a minimum! This is where these big nets really shine, after netting the fish leave the net IN the WATER! Get the hooks out, and the Muskie is now resting comfortably in the net, after its had a few minutes to recover, QUICKLY and safely lift it out of the water for a QUICK picture. Remember to hold the fish with 2 hands!!! Holding a big fish, Muskie or otherwise vertically by the gill plate ain't good for it!  Having the proper release tools is essentail! My last fish of 2007 was a nice 45""er from the French river area and it had a 13"" Gramma hooked badly under its jaw, NO way I coulda released that fish unharmed without hook cutters! You can buy a pair of mini-bolt cutters at Canadian Tire for $20, these and a pair of long nose pliers are a MUST HAVE!  Last but not least be careful! As much as I don't want to see a Muskie harmed, our safety is more important!"
