212148,brkygetr,2008-06-07 01:27:00,425,"ok gonna make a portable fishing/hunting bivouack that is framed in PVC pipe and has a sewn 'ripstop' shell. I have been exploring the prospector tent idea for some time but just can't justify paying the price when I figure I can build one just as easy, and a LOT cheaper! For many years my friends and i have been building our own every year from cut birch saplings and covering it with poly. This works good but every year we have to rip it down and stash the poles in the bush (which rot eventually) and then throw away our 6 ml poly (which is much easier to bring IN on a roll then to take OUT in an annoying ball of plastic!) cause its full of staple holes and such.  SOOO.... I am gonna build one that is made of PVC and has a permanent shell that I can just throw over top. All of this will fit into the bed of a truck or a boat easy enough and can be set up quickly.     At least thats the idea.  Has anybody done this???? Problems to avoid?  Any help would be appreciated."
212156,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-07 01:39:00,314,Buddy has one..........  is a cats azz.  only issue i recall him saying is he burned a hole in canvas or what ever he used with heater.  other than that..........its perfect.  he built is in his garage with ease.

212239,Greencoachdog,2008-06-07 10:42:00,8163,"You can use sunlight resistant PVC conduit, and it's cheaper than plumbing PVC."
212289,brkygetr,2008-06-07 15:10:00,425,right on GCD I'll check that out.....this will not be in the sun for long periods of time as I will be using it as a camp in various locations and taking it down when I leave. It is gonna be 12 x 16 though so I am a little concerened about the weight bearing on conduit ( I am assuming this conduit is only 1 inch???)

212297,johnnyb,2008-06-07 15:38:00,3413,this sounds pretty intriguing....hopefully you will post some pics of your progress along the way!
