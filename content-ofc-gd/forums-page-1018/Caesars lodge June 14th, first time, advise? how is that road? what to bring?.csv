You can certainly drive the full route. You end up at a dock and unless you call ahead from the little restaurnat on Clova road about halfway in you may end up waiting for the barge to pick you up. We ended up having to start one of the boats there and drove it to the liodge and one of the helpers came and picked us up. The road is nasty, but a four wheeler is fine. Good time to check out the sites, we almost always run across a bear or two on the way in. Logging trcuks can be a hazard for the first half of the road trip in but just pay attention, If theres miore than one vehicle in your party, stay well back especiallly if the road is dry, The dust is a killer. If youre bringing eggs, be sure to pack them carefully, the first time we went in we endeup up with a cooler full of goo! Wasnt pretty.  We are flying out for the first three nights and back to the main lodge for the Friday and Saturday night. If the weather is like now, the trout fishing will be very slow as they will pool up in the deeper sections of the lake. Walleye on the other hand should be very active!!!! Any other questions just ask"
