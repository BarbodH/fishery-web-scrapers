211593,Dondorfish,2008-06-06 02:23:00,1000,Hey all. Figured that I would clean the top on the Islander and was wondering what the best thing is to use. Anyone got any suggestions?    Thanks  Don  
211599,Guest skeeter99,2008-06-06 02:34:00,0,when I used to detail boats and sleds the best thing for the boat tops was simple green can be found at crappy tire and auto parts stores
211621,Mike the Pike,2008-06-06 03:29:00,3421,Don you can use an awning cleaner for RV's from CTC or Wallmart in the Automotive sections and believe it or not good old VIM.  Mike

211784,forrest,2008-06-06 14:14:00,1032,Before throwing any chemicals on something I always try baking soda w/ scrub brush or cloth and then a wipe down with a 1/5th vinegar/water mixture.  It it works great on the worst bath tubs and a bunch more (thats right zero Mr. Clean etc in my house).  The baking soda removes the grime.  The Vinegar is an anti-fungal agent.  Neither work as a soap though so to do degreasing after baking soda use a mild soap.   Better than chemicals and may suit your applicaiton.   forrest

211807,Stoty,2008-06-06 14:41:00,2910," I totally agree! Having 2 puppies, we didnt want to have all those chemical cleaners around the house, so we threw them all out and strictly use vinegar/water to clean everything (toilets, tubs, sinks, floors, etc)."
211808,Stoty,2008-06-06 14:42:00,2910,"Plus, the smell, gets you in the mood for french fries!"
211810,Rattletrap2,2008-06-06 14:44:00,1652,I agree! vinegar / water and baking soda will clean most anything.
211985,Dondorfish,2008-06-06 20:42:00,1000,Thanks for the pointers guys. I'll give it a go next weekend and see how it turns out. Top is not real bad but I thought I would freshen it up before it gets any worse.  Thanks again   Don
