Once we got to Simcoe we noticed the winds and waves were a bit to much for us and headed to the Kawarthas for some walleye and panfish.  Joe and I heading to spot #1   Once on the spot I explained what we were fishing and how to approach it.  First cast I jig, jig, jig and got this one.  We joked later in the day how I could host the One Fish Fishing show as I did a great little seminar and bang on the first cast nailed the targetted species.  That would be the only eye of the day.   We did end up getting a few panfish and some OOS species which kept out interest up.         At the end of the day though the damage wound be revealed.  Figured it happened right at the launch.  Oh well, poop happens.   A few for a snack.   And the money shot!   Once again a great day on the water with some great people."
