The first time out there I had truck problems that happened on the drive up. We arrived on the Saturday and after buying our fishing licence the truck wouldnt start. Got towed to the dealership in Wabush and set up camp there for the weekend. I think every single person who owned a toolbox in the twin cities there came and tried to fix the truck. Never asked a cent some brought beer. Couldnt fix it, but Ill never forget the way people went out of their way for us."

For granny to have birthed 1200 kids she would have had to have lived to about 400 years old and had quadruplets everytime.

211844,bpsbassman,2008-06-06 15:26:00,941,"Thanks so much Sinker.  I am in love with Newfoundland and have never been there.  One of my ""50 Things to Do Before I Die"" Our band (FishGuts) plays a bunch of Newfie Songs.  SaltWater Joys and Song of Newfoundland to name a few. Looking at the pics sends chills down my spine. Thanks again."
211994,Sinker,2008-06-06 21:07:00,8692," Thanks all, glad you's enjoyed it.  My great grand mother DELEIVERED over 1200 babies in her day.......LOL. I don't know what I was thinking when I wrote that.  She'd travel thru any conditions by boat/doglsled/or just hike it on foot to where ever you were when it was time to deliver your baby. Keep in mind, in those days there were no roads or forms of communication. If you needed her help, you'd have to find a way to get where she was......usually by boat. There are lots of stories about her in that area of NFLD.  Sinker"
