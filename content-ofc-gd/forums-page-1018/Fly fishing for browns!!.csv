211409,MuddyWater,2008-06-05 20:00:00,218,went to attempt casting some bugs for browns again this time i hit a spot thats alot more open and had little skits and blackflies although those dam red ants were angry. nailed this nice brownie it was just over a pound i also caught lots of baby salmon not sure if their chinny's or cohos. im thinking coho because the stream i was fishing gets a decent run on coho. gona get out for some more tommorow!!!  
211415,Puckhead,2008-06-05 20:08:00,377,I think that's a coho juvie.
211425,Reef Runner,2008-06-05 20:19:00,981,"Nicely done.  I think its a coho fry as well.  Thanks for sharing,  reefrunner"
211426,wallacio,2008-06-05 20:24:00,475,"Nice Brown!  As for the Salmon smolt it is most likely a Coho as mentioned.   Chinooks typically smolt and leave the river at a very small size, far too small to take a dry fly anyway.   Additionally, although it's difficult to tell from the photo the anal fin on the fish in question appears to have a longer leading edge than does the rest of the fin which is a characteristic of Coho smolts (as opposed to Chinook)."

211555,MuddyWater,2008-06-06 00:42:00,218,i was using a good old reliable black gnat. nothing was really hatching so i just tossed a big black gnat the wind was blowing pretty good so i figured it would look like a terrestrial or something anywas it worked.
211573,danbo,2008-06-06 01:29:00,2646,Don't forget to swing a streamer for the bigguns!
