211835,Puckhead,2008-06-06 15:19:00,377," I'm honestly stunned that people are upset that this was poll was put up...  I was viewing a hockey post (I know, shocking), and a poster was complaining about it being non fishing.  I had noticed posts previously complaining about the same thing over and over again.  I actually talked with an ex member the other day and he mentioned the same thing.  I personally don't have a problem with NF topics - obviously, and as you most graciously pointed out through a summary of my posting history. (I have been around OFC well before there was a ""C"" - almost the full 10 years, but thanks for that...)  Things change - the last time we had a poll on this topic was, what I thought anyway, a long time ago.  I wanted to see if it is bugging more people than I thought.  And if it wasn't and all was still status quo, I could still go ahead and contribute nothing to the F part of OFC, as you pointed out.  I don't understand the lynching for putting this poll up.  I explained on the first page why I was asking about it... I honestly had no ill intention of putting this up and had no idea some of the regulars here would get ticked off about it.  Thanks for pointing out the lack of contribution to OFC from the ""originator of this thread""."

211317,Puckhead,2008-06-05 16:38:00,377,Well....?
211318,Greencoachdog,2008-06-05 16:40:00,8163,Why?
211320,Puckhead,2008-06-05 16:42:00,377,People seem to get annoyed at all the NF content from posters like yours truly...   I'm just curious if it is really a big of an annoyance to more people than I thought...
211323,Victor,2008-06-05 16:45:00,1609,here we go again!  
211325,rickster,2008-06-05 16:50:00,495,I agree with greencoachdog  why?  if the topic title doesn't interest you don't open it  
211326,scuro,2008-06-05 16:50:00,386,I come here to read about fishing. The website is big enough now that a fishing forum could stand alone with plenty of daily posts. I'd be reading more and responding more if there wasn't a ton of clutter and POV pushing posts deluting the posted fishing entries.
211327,Zubris21,2008-06-05 16:51:00,563,I don't mind the non-fishing content at all.  It's nice when it is labelled as non-fishing (NF) as per the rules.  I think if we had 2 separate sections I would be more annoyed with all the flipping back and forth I would need to do.
211329,Stoty,2008-06-05 16:54:00,2910,Amen brother!
211331,Puckhead,2008-06-05 16:57:00,377, I'll second the amen and raise it with a halleluiah.
211334,Stoty,2008-06-05 16:58:00,2910," HAHAHA, nicely said!"
211335,Greencoachdog,2008-06-05 17:00:00,8163, I'll see ya with a Hell Yeah!!!

211341,Greencoachdog,2008-06-05 17:04:00,8163, Good! Then you won't reply to the fact that I think yer a party pooper and you catch small fish!!!

211345,ecmilley,2008-06-05 17:10:00,2163,Being that this is not just a regular forum but a fishing family I like to read about what everyone is up to and if I don't feel like reading I skip over it no big deal. lets stop beating ourselves over this
211349,TJQ,2008-06-05 17:17:00,7806,"Personally... I only read the non-fishing posts....  they are the only ones I can usually help with.....  From day 1 - going back 10 years now in whatever form the board had, its always been one main discussion forum and as long as Im involved, thats the way it will stay.... as a matter of fact, we've already broken it up and added a tourney forum... so non tourney types don't have to wade through that, as well as a photo forum, so those that don't want to look at non fishing pictures dont have to and we've seperated news, announcements and contests off as well....  Its ten times more fragmented now than as it used to be as it is. personally... I'd like to have 50 threads on the main page to go down through, to see what interests me.  By the way puckhead.. I love your avatar... I could watch him do that all day.... maybe I will...."

It may not be all fishing all the time, but I challange you to find a group of people willing to dish out some much help on a consistant basis....  and its not just my house any more...  its a mod partnership....   rather than having a splitting headache... we split on headaches...."
