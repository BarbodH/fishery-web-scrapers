So I headed for a sheltered bay thinkin I'll catch some perch or sunnies for a while on a nice day then head home--well I was drifting jig and worm and had a nibble--felt perchish--thought I'd try some ""Gulp"" baits I just bought on a jig.  10 feet later 23 inch walleye---10 more feet another small guy under slot (supper fish) then heres the new rule--all after were over 18 inches so I figured I had din din and went home.  Moral of story sometimes they're not on the wavy side--and you don't have to get beat up to catch them.  "
