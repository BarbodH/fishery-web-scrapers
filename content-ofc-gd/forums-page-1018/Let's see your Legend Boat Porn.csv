212219,jwl,2008-06-07 05:12:00,1056,"I know, I know, been done before..a ""new guy"" comes on the board and next thing you know there is a post pertaining to what everyone is floating in out there.  I just thought this might be interesting in light of a recent post that Outdoorsman had started pertaining to showing off his new ride. That got into a bit of common discussion with a couple of us regarding Legend Boats, and I read back in posts or see on the board since joining that a few people have Legend Boats, and thought it might be pretty cool to compare a little about the different styles and models of some of the Legend Boats anyone has out there.  Sure it's a fishing forum and we all love the boat porn now and again, and before everyone starts with the   ..this brand of boat sucks, that brand of boat is junk for whatever reason.  On a forum like this there are many many different levels of anglers so to speak....right from tourney pro's, the odd fishing show affiliated guys, guides,ole diehards,weekend warriors, and so on right down to the up and comers. That being mentioned there are many people with a huge amount of experience with boats and I bet ya that someone some where has heard the exact same type of horror stories with all makes and models of boats..I am sure the same goes with your motor as well..guys have everything from old beater 3 horse kickers to the newest 225's and up and different experiences with that as well.  I just thought, being a Legend owner it was kind of cool to see some other models of Legends popping up in the forum and of course it is the time of year that many lucky people get to go toy shopping  I must say that ours was a great investment for the family,been a pretty solid ride with many many hours of fun and adventure logged on her, we use it and use it hard...we treat her well she treats us well, runs good as the day it came out of the box....well the day I started rippin around after the couple tanks of gas break in period   Well here is what I got to share  2003 Legend V-151 Viper- 2 stroke Oil Injected 40 Merc       and also got that same winter  2003 -14 ft Legend Ultralite-nothing fancy on the back of that one  just my old reliable Evinrude 9.9      you can even see for a small tinner, still a bit of room for a couple people and some gear as me and my buddy up front paddle into the shore to pull the boat out before I had my dock in for the season..great you can pop it in andout of the water pretty easy, and as you cas see, plenty of room for my littlest one in the middle as well     All in all I am pretty happy with my experiences with these boats, hope ya'll wanna share a little more"

212262,danbouck,2008-06-07 13:20:00,4380,Mine is a 2008 Extreme 16 with a 50HP four stroke Decided to get all the goodies on it and it's perfect for the family. The full top makes it very comfortable to sleep on as well. The gas consumption (or lack of) is unbelievable.

212266,danbouck,2008-06-07 13:56:00,4380, Nice! I bet that thing moves well
212271,jwl,2008-06-07 14:03:00,1056,"nice guys, thanks for sharing.  I do know that Denis has had a tonne of trouble with the one he had though, just an example that can happen to any make/model of boat...mine has been trouble free and loaded with fun the whole time we had it.  I just think it's cool to see some of the differences in some of the models of boats that's why i started this thread up"
212274,danbouck,2008-06-07 14:11:00,4380,There were a lot of Legends sold this year. Everywhere I take it there are always a few people taking theirs out for the first time.  All makes of anything have issues. There is no way you can purchase something and KNOW 100% that there will be no issues.
