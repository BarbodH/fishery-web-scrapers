211850,perodimi,2008-06-06 15:34:00,124,"Hi All,  Went out early this morning with the warm weather approaching, what a great day. Caught this 11 pounder around 07:30:  "
211852,ozaibak1,2008-06-06 15:40:00,401,"nice one looks very tasty, what you catch it on?"
211855,perodimi,2008-06-06 15:43:00,124,Got him on a dipsey diver and green spin doctor meat rig baited with store bought herring. Now if I can only get BigCliff to show me how to catch fish on Sturgeon Lake sometime this summer...  Peter
211878,Reef Runner,2008-06-06 16:10:00,981,Nice eater.  Good job.
211881,Spiel,2008-06-06 16:16:00,9065,"....Actually it's a King and a fine eater for sure. I erred big time this morning by not getting up early and dragging myself out there, maybe Sunday."
211884,highdrifter,2008-06-06 16:22:00,2534," Noice!  That be a chinny though.  Still, better than a kick in the teeth.  yyaaarrr HD"
211898,anders,2008-06-06 17:08:00,1168,Nice Fish!!  First thing i noticed was the black jaw.  Solid catch...we wont catch em till August late July here
211899,medmart,2008-06-06 17:12:00,587,Nice one Pete you did you take with you Lou or DAD  Rob
211919,perodimi,2008-06-06 18:41:00,124,"Sorry guys, I haven't refined my fish identification skills yet!  Rob, no I just went on my own because I wasn't sure if I was even going because they were calling for higher winds but as it turned out, it was a beautiful morning. It was hard to land because of all the gear and long leader - Rod up high and my new salmon net down low.  We need to hook up and have our own derby!  Peter"
211927,MuddyWater,2008-06-06 18:53:00,218,"this is a coho i got last year i love catching them they can be so great to fight, i usually look at the tail because chinnys have spots all over the tail but cohos have them on the top and bottom no middle spots and the gums. in the fall they get some wicked colours nice reds. one year i just missed the ontario record with a 18.5lb from b-ville creek thats when it was 22lb or something DAM!! then it went to like 30 or something crazy lol "
211956,misfish,2008-06-06 20:01:00,29133,"Nice fish. I guess you,ll be out there now eh Bro.LOL Watch the winds."
211958,Spiel,2008-06-06 20:05:00,9065," No need to apologize Peter, just trying to help you learn."
212074,Reel Nauti Pirate,2008-06-06 23:38:00,52,Many boats fishing the Bluffers yet??? I thought the hot action was up Oakville way... I like the Bluffers nice launch and you do not need to go out real far to find fish. How many feet of water were you working and how many feet down?? Thanks.   PS This is a Coho 
212089,perodimi,2008-06-07 00:04:00,124,"Hi Nitro Man,  Just me out this morning but after the cool fog lifted, I saw one boat further out towards the nuclear plant. When I headed back around 10:30, two more were heading out.  I caught this one right at the outer cardinal buoy south of the Bluffs in 100 fow on a Dipsey Diver, Green Spin Doctor combo with a chrome meat rig and believe it or not, grocery store bought herring that I filet'd to size. I don't have a counter on that particular reel so I can't say how much line I had out but it was about half my 25lb spool.  Like you say, an excellent launch despite the bird crap everywhere. I like weekdays when nobody's around and parking is free.  Cheers,  Peter"
212094,medmart,2008-06-07 00:18:00,587, Hey Pete i am going out sunday if you are around and want to come maybe Lou and Dad want to go out let me know Rob
212096,Reel Nauti Pirate,2008-06-07 00:22:00,52, Keep me posted it is a 4 hour drive for me to get there. I make Nitro Spoons and have a few new patterns to try up that way before they go into production!! I love the Bluffers!!! Thanks for the reply!
212099,Sinker,2008-06-07 00:25:00,8692," I would gladly show you how/where to catch the eyes on sturgeon. Its easy once you get to know where/when to go. If your heading up this way, shoot me a pm. I might just be on the water that day anyways. I'm docked up the road from Cliff.  Sinker"
212257,perodimi,2008-06-07 12:29:00,124,"Hi Sinker,  Thanks for the offer, I'd love to take you up on that. My boat will be in Snug Harbor at Lunge Haven again this season as we have a trailer at Nestle Inn down the road.  Cheers,  Peter"
212395,Sinker,2008-06-08 00:23:00,8692,I'm sure we'll be seeing each other then  Sinker
