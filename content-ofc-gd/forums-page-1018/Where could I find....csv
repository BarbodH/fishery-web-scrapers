I love the reel, its served me very well and Im not ready to give up on it just yet. The clutch bearing is blown (or I thought it was, took the reel apart and pulled the bearing out, soaked it in degreaser and tossed it back in and it is working...for now.) and I would like to get it replaced before my trip next month. I can do all the work, I just need somewhere that has the part because I dont think that my red green repair is going to last a week of hard fishing.  Should I just call Shimano direct or will they cost me arm and leg?"
