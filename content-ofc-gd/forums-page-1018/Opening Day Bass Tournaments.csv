211870,Fang,2008-06-06 15:59:00,1330,"From my understanding most of the tourneys have gone away from opening day events. Although prefishing an opening day tournament is not allowed they decided to avoid the possibility of any anglers being on the lakes ""scouting""."
211883,Stoty,2008-06-06 16:20:00,2910,"Makes sense. Then again, anyone who has gone crappie/walleye fishing should know where the fish are right now! ahhah.  I was just hoping to find a ""local"" tournament or something to fish."
