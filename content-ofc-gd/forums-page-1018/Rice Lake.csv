210132,taper,2008-06-03 11:39:00,611,I have a good friend at work that is heading to Rice lake next week. He asked if I knew any thing about it and I said no but knew where I could get some good help. He is mainly a musky fisherman but I am guessing  he will be happy catching any thing on his first trip out this year. Any advice I can pass along would be greatly appreciated.
210205,tbayboy,2008-06-03 13:52:00,1497,"Hi Taper, There was a bit a discussion about it last week on this thread  Rice Fishging Lately that might help.  Didn't help me a whole lot unfortunately as the cold and winds made things a bit of a mess but we ended up with a nice accidental musky trolling the edge of some weed beds if that helps (if he wants to try trolling small walleye targeting spinners for musky  )"
210233,Bitsmith2k,2008-06-03 14:47:00,396, always blaming it on the weather eh sean?
210424,mikeh,2008-06-03 20:42:00,824,"hi Taper, when I target musky on Rice Lake, I usually go up the Otonabee River to the Wallace Point bridge and work the banks back to the lake  with a spinnerbait or suick and have had some success.I fnd the spinnerbait doesn't get snagged as much as a bait with trebles on the fallen trees along the shoreline. I also find if they have the dam open, there is too much current and I  don't do as well. This is the pattern I use in the fall but I think it might work in the spring also as the fish start feeding again. hope this helps."
210438,Smokey,2008-06-03 21:10:00,1278,All good info and the waters are low in the river right now. Another spot to give a go is the deep channel that runs out from Bewdley on the south side towards Hastings. You can either troll it or cast both edges of it. They can be found all over the lake but are getting tougher to catch each year.
210544,PatrickGG,2008-06-04 01:11:00,562,The Lower dam in hastings is always a hot spot anchor in the current and jig if no luck pull out and hit the upper end of rice both the lower dam and the upper dam have free boat launches..
210677,Stoty,2008-06-04 12:43:00,2910, Did you mean towards Harwood? Hastings and Bewdley are on the complete opposite sides of the lake.
210724,Rich,2008-06-04 13:48:00,3927,Try from the mouth of the Indian River all the way up to the bridge in Keene.
210737,Smokey,2008-06-04 14:06:00,1278,  Opposite ends of the lake and both in a NE direction from Bewdley same direction the channel runs. Easy enough to find.
210748,Stoty,2008-06-04 14:35:00,2910," Ya, I know where the channel is because I grew up fishing Rice, but people who aren't familiar with the lake might see that Hastings and Bewdley are on opposite ends of the lake and be confused."
210772,fishermccann,2008-06-04 15:19:00,655,I hope your not saying that you are going to target an out of season fish!!!!
210783,Whopper,2008-06-04 15:34:00,2174,Maybe in front of here Rich?  
210789,Stoty,2008-06-04 15:51:00,2910,"HAHAHA, love that shack! always some good bass around there!"
212157,taper,2008-06-07 01:41:00,611,Sorry guys I have been just swamped this week and have not been around much. Thanks for all the great info. I'll make sure he gets it. Thanks again.
