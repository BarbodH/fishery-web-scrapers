Saw some fish rising to the surface to eat the flys, I'm guessing they were bass.  Anyways my target was walleye.  Marked a few fish suspened just off the bottom in 13-16fow.  Surface temps have started to warm up, it was about 70 across the east end of the lake including Callander Bay.  Didn't catch anything, but had a few hits.  Today was more of a fact finding mission than anything, so I'm hoping to get out and do some serious fishing later this weekend.  Mike"
