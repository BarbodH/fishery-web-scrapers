211221,ccmtcanada,2008-06-05 12:55:00,7971,"Bly and I have been planning on painting our kitchen and the time had finally come.  I went out and bought everything we needed a few nights ago...since our babysitter is away at camp for the week, we figured this was the perfect time to start!  At around 7pm last night, Fishnsled shows up at our door and says he's free tonight to fish for carp....so I take one look at Bly and she says ""Go fish"".  WOOHOO!!!!  So, leaving Bly back at the house to paint, I met Fishsled at our local spot at around 8:30.  The carp are starting to come back in numbers as every time we cast out there, we'd feel some action within minutes.  I was the first to pull on in....a small, but FAT one....   About 15 minutes later, Fishnsled gets one on and gets this ""beauty"".   We still felt action, but had no takers until around 10pm.  This one just took off without any warning.  The fight was pretty quick, and once landed we noticed it was missing an eye and had a nice chunk taken out of it's side.....wonder if a pike in the area was cruising for dinner!   Fishnsled then says he'll leave his line our for another 10 minutes before we called it a night.  Just as those 10 minutes were about to expire, he gets the biggest one on of the night.  This one thought it was a trout, going on long runs and jumping out of the water during the fight! This weighed 19 pounds.   It's always a great time fishing with Will....he's hooked on these fish....esp since this spot is literally 5 minutes from his place.  We'll get out again next week buddy!! ======================================================================  Bly and I haven't been posting many reports lately, but we have been out there a few times a week and she has KICKED my butt in the past 3 weeks.  I think she's landed about 12 to my 3 in that time frame.  Here are some pics of our catches....          "

211339,wolfville,2008-06-05 17:04:00,396,Some nice fish there.... WTG !
211363,dsn,2008-06-05 17:43:00,1018,CCMT you got it made bro. I would love to have friend who just comes knocking on my door and say hey lets go fishing out of the blue. For sure I would never turn it down. Plus a place to go close by... thats amazing.  Those fish sure look beat up sore form mating?  DSN
211364,rickster,2008-06-05 17:47:00,495,way to go cliff you never fail to post a great report with a lot of great pics 
211413,fishinggeek,2008-06-05 20:06:00,325,"Cliff, for someone who just got back into fishing, your carp and steelhead reports put me to shame.  Good job!"
211444,fishnsled,2008-06-05 21:07:00,3520,Great report Cliff as aways.  What job do you need to get out of next week?      Actually Bly gave her permission last week to get Cliff out so I was just following orders.  DSN  - not sure if the battle wounds are from spawning or not.  I don't think they've started yet.   Could be competing for partners?   I'm just a rookie to this carp thing.  Thanks for a great night Cliff and we will do it agian next week.  Got to get out one more time before the fly-in.  Just a week to go!
211448,denisk,2008-06-05 21:12:00,163,Wow you guys really did good considering it was all at night.  That's one way I've never tried fishing forthem but it obviously works awesome

211757,fishnsled,2008-06-06 13:40:00,3520,"  Send me a pm when you want to go, act surprised and Monique won't have a clue!      Oh wait a minute, she does check in here.  Busted.    Guess you'll be cutting the grass TJ. lol!"
211771,The Urban Fisherman,2008-06-06 14:03:00,2050,"Right on guys!  I haven't chased any carp yet this year.  Been to busy with the bluegill and in-land bows......Tried once but Ginny threw away my corm that was in the freezer.... she almost got an ass whopin' for that one! heh  Cheers, UF"
