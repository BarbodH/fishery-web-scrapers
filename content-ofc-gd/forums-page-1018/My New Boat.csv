212105,jwl,2008-06-07 00:38:00,1056," a month???, that seems like quite the while, we got ours into the dealership within days of ordering it, I think if we ordered the boat, with upgrades  on say a Wednesday afternoon, it was in the lot by first thing Moday mornign and out on the water for a test run...and it was about this time of year."
212123,allbusiness,2008-06-07 00:51:00,23,"Brother, I ordered my boat end of march - still haven't gotten it - that's almost 2 1/2 months. dealer told me it's coming in this monday and it won't take long for him to rig it up, so I'm hoping mid next week, I'm not holding my breath though, and when I call him to ask I'm expecting him to say: ""yeah... it's due to come in in another week you'll get it soon""  He told me theres been a lot of hold ups with legend - they get the hull shipped to them from smokercraft and they do their thing to it - Mercury motors are made in california (I think) and are shipped to Vancouver then transported here. I guess it's not really his fault that the manufacturers are falling behind on their orders, so I guess I just have to be patient.  Not like it really matters, I've been so swamped at work I wouldn't have been able to take it out anyways (But it would be nice just to look at it sitting in my driveway)"
212129,jwl,2008-06-07 00:57:00,1056," sorry to the guy for the bit of thread napping here  , it has to come to the dealer, and the dealer still has to rig it all up????? that sucks man, cuz when we got ours it came factory direct all rigged up with the upgraded motor,bowmount,extra seats, extras on the trailer, trailer plated, and so on, all signed sealed delivered and registered and all."
212133,allbusiness,2008-06-07 01:01:00,23,"Nope, He has my motor sitting at the dealership, Just needs a transom to mount it to. that's all the rigging it needs, On the dual console versions they transport them with the windshield off and the dealer would put that on too. Also other things they would rig up at the dealership are custom covers, and bimini tops."
212420,pikehunter,2008-06-08 01:54:00,1659," Congrats on the new boat! You should enjoy many hours of enjoyment. Legend brought out the 16' console the year after I bought my 16' Lowe tiller. If they had it in 2004/2005 I would have bought the Legend instead. As it was, Legend and Lowe were my final choices and it was a toss up on which I was buying, if the Legend dealer in Ft. Erie had returned my call before the Lowe dealer my garage could very well  be housing a Legend now.  I am though pleased with my decision.  Happy"
212422,ccmtcanada,2008-06-08 01:58:00,7971,Sweet ride and congrats!  I was just looking in a magazine at that lineup of boats and thought that would be ideal for our family.  You'll have great times in that boat I'm sure!
212447,kennyman,2008-06-08 03:30:00,737,Nice looking boat. Wish it was coming home with me. I didn't know the Legends had Smokercraft hulls. Something to keep in mind. My dad bought a Smokercraft 16' brand new about twenty years ago and it and the 60hp yammy are still going strong. Anyway congrats you lucky devil   .
212459,mrpike,2008-06-08 03:58:00,151,THAT will do the job . All the best and leave some for the rest of us.. ONLY TAKE WHAT YOU WILL EAT. AND play safe on the water at all times. YEARS of fun ahead for the hole family. DON'T forget the pictures.
212499,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-06-08 11:21:00,1362,nice ride!!....congrats
211688,Jay T,2008-06-06 11:49:00,282,"Well this year I took the plunge and got a brand new boat, the 12 1/2 footer I had for 12 years just was not cutting it anymore. I couldn't get out and do a lot of the fishing I wanted to do, and having 4 in the family now there wasn't enough room for us all in that old boat. So I decided to go for a Legend boat 16' side console with a 25hp 4 stroke merc efi electric tilt, it doesn't fly but it makes 32-34 mph on the GPS and it is great on gas to. I am having a hard time staying off the water even more so now, it is so much better and lots of room for us all and we have slimed the boat quite a bit to. Anyways here are a few pics of the boat.  "
211693,Smokey,2008-06-06 12:01:00,1278,Congrats. Should be a great ride for you for many years.
211694,jwl,2008-06-06 12:04:00,1056,"good stuff, hope she treats you well on the water and sees lots of fish,I also run a Legend, well 2 actually...Viper with a 40 on it, and a 14 footer  Ultralite with a 9.9, treated my family very well for the last 5 seasons, never a problem.  I am sure your familly will have loads of fun in the new ride"
211696,Greencoachdog,2008-06-06 12:05:00,8163,Ooooo!!! New boat porn!!!  You'll catch lots more fish outta that console than you would've a tiller!!!  Now go get it WET!!!
211731,Victor,2008-06-06 13:09:00,1609,Congrats on the new ride! Now lets see some fish in that boat
211744,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-06 13:24:00,314,Great new boat!  I really need to convince the wife that i should be fishing in one like that to  Congrats..........im sure you will enjoy
211761,Jay T,2008-06-06 13:42:00,282,  It was my mine that convinced me into getting a new one
211781,Reef Runner,2008-06-06 14:12:00,981,Congrats on the new ride.  Many stories to come will be borne from that haul.  Hope you and the family get much enjoyment out of the craft.
211786,forrest,2008-06-06 14:19:00,1032,"I think 30mph is flying, especially with the weight of the console, and you want to go faster?"
211816,Jay T,2008-06-06 14:49:00,282," I never said I wanted to go faster, but compared to some boats that is slow. It is just fine for me the way it is, and with the price of gas I didn't want a bigger motor just to pay more $$$$."
211824,Roy,2008-06-06 15:08:00,13728,"Outdoorsman, you did good! Congrats on the new ride. You and your family will enjoy it for years. It'll also become some of your family's fondest memories. WTG!"
211828,Gerritt,2008-06-06 15:13:00,6129,NIIIICE!!! Congrats on the new boat and I look forward to the reports coming from aboard her!  G
211842,johnnyb,2008-06-06 15:23:00,3413,Hot Dang!  Nice boat -- way to go!!!!
211904,jdmls,2008-06-06 17:24:00,575,"nice boat...I have been looking and your Legend is probably one of the best boats for the money.....If I had space to put it , I would already have one !!"
211906,medmart,2008-06-06 17:34:00,587,Thats a nice new ride congrats  Rob
211987,jwl,2008-06-06 20:48:00,1056,"  all you guys are funny  with that, I get a kick out of the ""console guys"" and the ""tiller guys"" razzing eachother    I can't have an opinion on that...I have both  30 plus MPH is pretty good on the water...lots of bigger boats with bigger motors don't get much more out of em than that, sure maybe not the hole shot the bass boat guy get but.....you and your family will have a blast...My Legend Viper with the 40 on it in comparison with a bit more decking and heavier seats ect still comes in at about only 1000lbs all together, and I can get about 40 MPH out of it,2 guys and some fishin gear.  We use the boat for family boat rides, goofing off, tubing, ect along with fishing.....this way it was well justified as a ""family"" purchase  Looking forward to some great reports along the way..stay safe this summer on the water and get out there and have a blast with the family and friends"
211998,steve_paul,2008-06-06 21:11:00,658,"Nice boat Jay, congrats and hope to see lots of reports from her."
212001,b2kptbo,2008-06-06 21:18:00,1505,"Sure is a beauty, have fun..."
212004,Spiel,2008-06-06 21:26:00,9065,"....Very nice, it'll certainly open up new possibilities."
212009,idesign,2008-06-06 21:37:00,149, congratulation on ur new boat.Can u tell us how much did it cost you including all fees. thx enjoy ur new boat
212013,Greencoachdog,2008-06-06 21:58:00,8163, Go on down to the dealer and get a quote! Or check several dealers... talk to them.  Let them buy you a coke and sell you a boat...
212053,danbouck,2008-06-06 23:18:00,4380,Great looking boat! That speed is all you need. In my new 16 Legend with a 50 I get around 35mph (a lot heavier though)
212054,danbouck,2008-06-06 23:18:00,4380,  All prices are on the Legend website.
212079,Muskieman,2008-06-06 23:45:00,2472,Great purchase!!  I think that 30 + mph is very good for that boat & motor combo....  I have a 2002 Tracker V-14T Superguide and a 1999 30hp Evinrude 2 stroke with a 13 pitch prop   [ with flames should make me go faster].... and on GPS I get 30 by myself and gear 25mph loaded with 2 guys and gear..  Good Luck on the water....  Randy.
212104,allbusiness,2008-06-07 00:32:00,23,"Nice looking boat, I was so close to buying that boat this year - put down a deposit (the dealer only said it would take about a month to get the boat) and at the last minute I decided to upragde to v151 angler (still haven't got it yet - I'll posts pics when I do)  Is that a 2007 or a 2008? I thought that the 2008's were painted black and the driver seat was mounted directly to the floor?  anyway, congrats on the new boat"
