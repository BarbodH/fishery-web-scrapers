Or look at it this way - you could live down in GCD's part of the world and be too hot or hotter. He still needs to chill his beer if he leaves it outside in January. In summer he just drops his teabag in a cup of tapwater, sets it out on the deck and waits 10 or 15 minutes to drink it. Of course then he, being a sothren boy, adds ice and sugar. His filets go straight from the cleaning board to the plate, done perfectly.  Or go up there to Moosebunk's country, as beautiful as it is, and be too cold, or colder. He keeps his beer in a cooler so it doesn't freeze. They don't drink red wine because it needs to be enjoyed at room temperature (ours). He doesn't even have to put his filets on ice when he cleans 'em.  On the other hand us southern Canucks have got it all - air conditioning and high efficiency furnaces. Who needs more than that?

212253,cranks bait,2008-06-07 12:20:00,721,"Heat wave?  I'm indoors all day and our building is still radiating the cold from the winter.  Went out last night to fish.  It was foggy.  Got one follower to the boat and that was it.  Ran into another guy on the water.  Decided to zip back to the dock and both go out in one boat for some eyes.  Out till one caught a 3 and 6 pound (roughly) eye, 3.5 smally and a rocker smaller than the lure.  No camera so no entries for the team.  Oh ya, had to wear pants and a sweater, it was nice and cool on the water.  Got slapped when we hit shore though.  Guess I know where I'll be spending a lot of my time."
212260,kemper,2008-06-07 13:18:00,2232,"  That is what I would have said three weeks ago...but after studying the subject intensely for an culminating assignment it came out that the scientists from the UN have said that although global warming has been present in the past, it appears that the earth has not warmed since 2000. Hard to believe I know, but stay with me. They are now calling this ""global change"". SO yes, the ice caps are melting at an alarming rate, yes we are changing the climate BUT since the year 2000 for every 0.1 degree one continent has increased, somewhere else in the world has decreased.  I take no credit for this theory, im sure if you guys look hard enough you will find it too. Its in a report from the UN science dept. somewhere."
212325,Tybo,2008-06-07 19:01:00,1373,"I just love how it went from, man made global warming,too global warming too climate change. I've been a out side worker for 30 years, and the last heat wave I remember was 2000. A true heat wave is when the day temp and night temp only fluctuates 3 degree for 5 full days."
