211776,linweir,2008-06-06 14:06:00,202,Kawartha Park Marina is located between Stoney lake and Clear lake. You can easily get two lakes from there.  http://www.kawarthapark.com  Another place is called IslandView just at Young's Point  (705) 652-8498

211803,Stoty,2008-06-06 14:36:00,2910," My buddy owns Kawartha Park, very good establishment, and great launch."
211847,ozaibak1,2008-06-06 15:32:00,401,"I've driven by kawartha park many times, duno why I always keep forgetting to use them as a boat rental! Will definately do that next time as they open at 6am not 9am like the other one i use and is closer to where i camp (lovesick lake).  I don't recommend Islandview cuz the owners are asses, here's their strategy. They rent you a boat, if you come back after 6pm they try to charge you an extra $100, no joke, its pretty sick. They don't say that there would be a fee if you come back late... so I recommend not giving business to slimy people like that.  Lookin forward to tryin kawartha park next time out..."
211895,bassfighter,2008-06-06 17:00:00,366,Unfortunately Kawarthas Park charge $20 for boat launch? I called them  Too pricey for any kind of boat launch.  Any other suggestion
211903,Stoty,2008-06-06 17:22:00,2910,Not too sure...try giving them a call  (705) 654-3549
212043,4thgen,2008-06-06 23:05:00,157,There is a free government launch at McCrackens Landing which is about 15min from Youngs Point and about 30 seconds from clear lake. The only problem is that it is a bit shallow if you're launching something big. There is a deeper one there owned by the marina beside there but it is something like 8 in and 8 out which sucks. I've launched at Young's Point before at about 6am and there was nobody around so free! I suspect they have made it less accessable since though.
