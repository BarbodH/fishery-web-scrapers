212084,Spiel,2008-06-06 23:52:00,9065,....Some of you may recall I was looking for a new bait casting reel and had decided on this Pinnacle Matrix.      Well as it turns out the tackle store where I ordered it did not have any left. So in order to fill my order and make me happy they offered to substitue this Quantum.      So how does this equate into great customer service? Well they offered to give it to me for exactly the same price as the discontinued Pinnacle. This Quantum is a far better product than what I had origionally ordered. I tell you I'm ecstatic. Oh I forgot to mention the origional order called for two so they are giving me two at no extra cost!  And who has done this for me......All American Outdoors  Outstanding customer service! Thank you All American Outdoors.

212267,aplumma,2008-06-07 13:56:00,6896,I also ordered a few reels recently from All American Outdoors  and they are right now in the process of moving to a bigger and better warehouse. Since the orders are processed electronically it processed my order for 2 Tica gold reels but unfortunately they are out of stock for a little while. They sent me an Email to inform me that it was back ordered and asked me to call them. After talking with them they offered me a few choices in reels all of them were around the same price some more some less and they were offering me a refund for the lesser ones and a price adjustment on the more expensive ones. I decided to wait for the Tica gold series and will post a report on how the reel works out. If you are looking for a good Quantum Reel you can call them at 1-903-429-6003 I am sure they will be happy to give you a price quote on the reel so far I have never found better prices than them but then again I stopped checking after my 4th purchase....
