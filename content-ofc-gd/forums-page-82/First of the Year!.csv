1012617,FloatnFly,2017-09-03 03:48:00,1640,"After a long day, and a longer week at work, I headed out for some much needed alone time on the creek.  Water was crystal clear, so that meant light line, had to drop down to 6lb tippet to avoid them swimming around my line.  My skills were put to the test.  tied on a self made spey fly, and headed to my favourite pooltargetting the fish at the back end of the pool, this guy came from 10ft away from the front of the pool to smash my fly! fish on!  nice healthy male, just starting to develop the kype!

1012630,misfish,2017-09-03 16:48:00,29133,Look at the fangs.  Nice fish bud.
1012634,fishing n autograph,2017-09-03 20:18:00,2540,Nice fish!  I got skunked on the sauble this morning
1012748,FloatnFly,2017-09-05 17:04:00,1640," That's never fun,  are they running on that side of the province yet? Friend was just at the falls last week and saw nothing"
1012761,fishing n autograph,2017-09-05 20:00:00,2540,I hadn't seen any but they are running in the saugeen which is just south of the sauble
1012797,reydold,2017-09-06 09:59:00,10,Nice fish indeed! Congrats.
1012799,FloatnFly,2017-09-06 12:04:00,1640,"Yea, we see to go to the falls on the way to my grandparents just to watch the fish jump......and maybe see some bears"
1012803,AKRISONER,2017-09-06 12:55:00,5558,right on! cant wait to possibly get a couple of these on the fly.
1012853,FloatnFly,2017-09-06 23:21:00,1640,"They are a ton of fun,  big streamers are my go to for aggressive fish"
1012858,PUMP KNOWS,2017-09-07 00:24:00,937,I thought they wouldn't be line shy if they were aggressive.  I wanna try swinging salmon streamers this fall.
1012860,FloatnFly,2017-09-07 00:37:00,1640,"They are, I started with 10lb, then 8lb and finally 6lb they stopped swimming around my line.  The more fish that move in a pool the more spooked they get.  So you don't really want them swimming around your line"

So you don't really want them swimming around your line  care to share your salmon fly set up with a newbie? Im still figuring things out. if youd prefer PM please feel free to shoot me a message!  I was out last night, my buddys were catching small bows on their floats but it was a challenge to get them to take a fly. they were nipping but wouldnt commit.  the spot seems very promising for salmon once they really start running."
1012954,FloatnFly,2017-09-08 03:11:00,1640,"I have no problem sharing.  I use a 9ft 8wt rod, set the drag loose, so that the bend of the rod pulls it when the hook is in the holder. Then I use my hand on the reel to add pressure as needed.  Tippett size I find is dependent on water clarity.  Super clear water, down size, like I said above, I was using 6lb fluorocarbon tapered leader.  Using a Spey fly, or intruder style fly, just target a section of the pool at a time, just strip it it across the pool, careful not to foul hook.  You'll also get strikes when it rolls off the backs of other fish.  Be patient, have fun, be ready to let the drag go at the bite or hook set. With proper gear, and a good hook set, you can control the fish easy enough, just have to wait out the initial runs and jumps and be prepared to give chase, don't get caught in a spot you can't easily move out of"

1012973,FloatnFly,2017-09-08 12:12:00,1640,"Lol I hear ya there,  I enjoy the solitude on my creek.  Will never catch me at port hope in the fall."

Will never catch me at port hope in the fall.  i cant be bothered to river fish in a crowd id rather spend my time doing something else.  Last week the homies wanted to fish norval...wading surrounded by bramptonites netting big chubs to take home for dinner is not worth it.  Snuck out to a more secluded spot and it was just us three with no one around, and plenty of juveniles, a much much better time."
