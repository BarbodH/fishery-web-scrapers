1013556,captpierre,2017-09-17 00:25:00,2521,Haven't been on the water in a week but I bet temps are up from 68 F Where are the fish going to be? Still summer pattern? ?
1013559,leaf4,2017-09-17 00:45:00,2466,Dunno but camping this weekend has been amazing so far!?
1013560,OhioFisherman,2017-09-17 00:46:00,6623,"Looked at our weather forecast this morning 80 to 84 the next 7 days, after the extended cool spell we had the fall feed should be on? Find the baitfish and find the fish? the cool spell may have triggered the need to feed for winter?"
1013602,misfish,2017-09-17 20:20:00,29133,"Shoreline temp was 62 this morning. As I made it out to deeper grounds, it was 68. My flipping calves, were thankful. T,s and shorts still. I found a huge pod of  perch in 80 fow, Stacked from 0-60 fow.  They were moving along a west directional line."
1013630,Sinker,2017-09-18 02:34:00,8692,This stable weather has the fish snappin good!
1013634,manitoubass2,2017-09-18 03:38:00,11391,No good here cold front/water drop turned em off.  Water levels are stable now so I'd guess bass will be on fire in a day or 3  Walleye are on the feedbag big-time. Love this time of year
1013638,fishindevil,2017-09-18 10:01:00,6254,"smallies have been on fire the last few days.....in lakes where I fish 4-15ft is the majic number ...senkos on the sand/wood combos,as well as the small soft jerk shads and swimbaits because they are kind of shallow in my clear water lakes long casts and smaller baits have been the key........and they have been puking out small minnows and crayfish as well....the feed bag is on just gotta find them"
1013640,AKRISONER,2017-09-18 12:52:00,5558,"fished stoney this weekend for a tourney...caught ridiculous numbers...couldnt get much in the way of size..but that could have just been luck.  Regardless top water was trash, probably because surface temps are not stable at all.  The jerkbait bite was so so...but the drop shot bite in 15 fow was lights out...mid lake humps basically got all of our fish on drop shots.  We easily were catching 30 fish a day...some guys found some with some more size but thats also stoney lake for ya...tough to find bigguns."
1013641,Sterling,2017-09-18 12:54:00,477,"I'm still going deep (40ft+) with great success. That is, for walleye."
1013643,Dan668,2017-09-18 13:10:00,1120,"Smallies were on fire on gbay as well, I thought they'd be deeper but we did great in the 5-12ft range. they were hitting ferociously on the dropshot/tubes/swimbait. I figured because they were active, I'd try a topwater, not a single hit"
1013644,msp,2017-09-18 13:13:00,1336,Largies were shallow this weekend for me. Still in summer mode
1013645,AKRISONER,2017-09-18 13:18:00,5558,", I'd try a topwater, not a single hit  This"
1013647,BillM,2017-09-18 13:35:00,17367,"Pounded lakers this weekend, slowly getting into spawning mode.  Took a while to pattern them out however."
