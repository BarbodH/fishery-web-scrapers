Saw pictures earlier today of a looter that met a load of squirrel shot. Looked like it stung!!!
1012369,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-30 21:07:00,8243,"Houston Mayor announces "" Our entire city is under water !"" Area effected by flooding is greater than Katrina and Sandy in NY. Thousands still stranded, yesterday he said he hoped it was only hundreds stranded. Many say "" Thank the Lord deaths tolls haven't been greater"", I say who sent the hurricanes in the first place? God works in mysterious ways for sure. I am a believer by the way."
1012374,Big Cliff,2017-08-30 22:05:00,6899,"There is a big storm and a flood.  Guy is standing on his porch, house surrounded by water. A good samaritan comes by in a canoe and offers him a lift. Guy says no thanks the lord will take care of me.  Water keeps rising, guy is on his porch roof; water is almost up to his feet. A good samaritan comes by in a boat and offers him a lift. Guy says no thanks the lord will take care of me.  Water keeps rising, guy is now standing on the peak of his roof. A good samaritan comes by in a helicopter and offers him a lift. Guy says no thanks the lord will take care of me.  Guy drowns and goes up to heaven, he looks at the lord and asks why? I had faith that you would take care of me! Lord looks at him and said ""I sent a canoe, I sent a boat, I sent a helicopter, what more did you expect me to do?"

1012392,AKRISONER,2017-08-31 12:27:00,5558,"best thing ive heard thus far from a scientist  Katrina, the 100 year storm, sandy, the 100 year storm, houston the 500 year storm...damn thats a lot of century storms in a 10 year span...yet we still think climate change isnt real.  maybe those non believer texans will start to clue in."
1012472,Henricus,2017-09-01 01:53:00,118,"Harvey was the first major hurricane to hit the continental US in more than 12 years.  A graphic showing the greatest rainfall accumulations for Texas showed 4 of the heaviest rainfalls occurred before 1932 including 41"" in 1899.  If you are going to keep building/developing in the path of hurricanes, inflation says that storms are going to get more expensive.  Take your pick of arguments."
1012474,DRIFTER_016,2017-09-01 03:02:00,10439,Looks like the water is starting to recede. Seems there are now some vehicles with prop marks on their roofs!!!!  
1012484,AKRISONER,2017-09-01 11:44:00,5558,"i guess if you were one to have taken your boat out to help rescue, youve budgeted a new prop into the cost of doing so...respect goes out to those who were doing what they could to help in any way."
1012497,MJIG,2017-09-01 14:12:00,227,"With prop marks probably being just one of those vehicle's many problems, is there a way to properly salvage a submerged vehicle so that it will actually run again? I've wondered the same thing about vehicles that have dropped through the ice, or got stuck around the lower Don after a severe thunderstorm."

1013068,aplumma,2017-09-09 17:03:00,6896,A lot of the boats we run in the bayou have been designed to take a good hit and keep going. The z drive outboards are amazing going thru mud and stump fields with no damage. I run a jetdrive outboard on rocky rivers around here and skimming thru 4 inches of water and rapids are unnerving until you get used to it.   Art
1013084,Old Ironmaker,2017-09-09 20:45:00,8243,The engines are salvageable as long as vapor lock hasn't occurred. Some vehicle could use a good dip in the drink.
1013115,DanD,2017-09-10 09:37:00,2223,With all the electronics on today's vehicles I wouldn't touch one that has been submerged. Have you ever got your smart phone wet? I don't mean dunked but just rained on? Mine took 3 days in a bag of rice to start working somewhat normal. Now multiple that by that by at least 50 electronic modules on even the most basic vehicle. I'd only buy a watered down vehicle for its non electronic components.  Dan.

1012171,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-28 17:06:00,8243,"There's more than fish in that flood water. He may as well be swimming in an open septic pool. I was amazed to see all the rescues made by individuals that came from far off places with their Jon boats to rescue those unable to walk out. The folks sitting in hip deep water in a Nursing Home really hit me. The most vulnerable are our children and the elderly. I did have to chuckle though when I watched 2 good guys trying to get their deep V glass boat off the trailer in water just covering the bottom of truck tires. Later the CNN reporter was asking on behalf of authorities for those with ""flat bottom"" boats to come to the Houston area.  Thank God the hurricane didn't pan out as expected. Religious statement deleted."
1012172,captpierre,2017-08-28 17:09:00,2521,I guess South Texas is pretty flat. Nowhere for the water to go. Can't imagine 3-4 ft of rain.
1012176,AKRISONER,2017-08-28 18:05:00,5558,craziest thing ive seen yet  
1012178,manitoubass2,2017-08-28 18:13:00,11391,Wow that's insane!
1012181,DRIFTER_016,2017-08-28 19:36:00,10439,There's a bunch of insane pics from there.  Here's a bunch of before and after gifs.  https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/tropical-storm-harvey-houston-flooding-disaster
1012195,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-28 21:17:00,8243,"THIS IS NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT  POTUS just said in a press conference 15 minutes ago, ""It is the greatest flood, a huge flood in the history of all the floods"". I sure hope not. It's sure is bad, it is said the crest will not happen until Wednesday or Thursday. People still trapped on roof tops according to Houston's mayor as I type. Need more help from the Feds. I'll stop right there Art."
1012196,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-28 21:19:00,8243,"New Lake Houston, that has to be 30' deep, more? Wowza."
1012198,OhioFisherman,2017-08-28 21:30:00,6623,One of our local news channels says Houston got more rain in 72 hours than we have received in 9 months! It's hard to imagine that amount of rainfall for me.
1012207,DRIFTER_016,2017-08-28 22:36:00,10439,One of our local news channels says Houston got more rain in 72 hours than we have received in 9 months! It's hard to imagine that amount of rainfall for me.  Just saw some rainfall totals and the highest amount in that 72 hour time span was 39.25 inches!!!! That's 999.96 mm of rain in 3 days!!!
1012208,manitoubass2,2017-08-28 22:37:00,11391,"Hopefully everyone is ok first and foremost.  I cannot imagine the cost associated with that kind of flood, financially  Obviously the human toll is priceless.  OI, that's easily 30ft. Unreal"
1012212,OhioFisherman,2017-08-28 22:52:00,6623,"I can understand being attached to an area, family ties, work, etc, but this is their 3rd major flooding event since 2015? When do you say enough already?  http://money.cnn.com/2017/08/28/news/economy/hurricane-harvey-economy/index.html"
1012219,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-29 01:30:00,8243,"Where are they going to go? Like most big cities many are working at minimum wage and many have no work at all. Canada's last modern age natural disaster was Ft. Mac. There are larger urban neighbourhoods in Houston that all of Fort McMurray. Imagine Toronto under 4 feet of water, I can't but it can happen, Hurricane Hazel, October 1954. If some of the younger guys here don't know much about it Google it. I was born that week while the Hurricane devastated southern Ontario. A warning of things to come? The Hamilton Hurricane's are named that for a reason."
1012227,OhioFisherman,2017-08-29 02:28:00,6623,"Old, really no idea, but if business and industry stops investing in that area they will have to go somewhere? This is really nothing new?  http://www.wxresearch.com/almanac/houflood.html  By my count over 100 flooding events in that area since 1954? doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is insanity? Grant the scale is different, but suppose Global Warming is the new reality?  Any area of our countries can have a national disaster, but why put millions of people in an area known for them? and it would seem a lot of them don't even have flood insurance?  http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2017/08/28/half-houston-homes-businesses-hit-by-flooding-may-be-uninsured.html"

1012241,captpierre,2017-08-29 12:50:00,2521,News says less than half have insurance to cover the damage. Likely too expensive due to high risk area.

I wish I could get down there to help in some way, I feel so sorry for those that have lost everything, it must tare the heart right out of a person to watch everything you have worked so hard for destroyed like that!"
1012276,Headhunter,2017-08-29 18:36:00,5703,Yah my heart goes out to all those poor folks. Just a heads up. It might be a good time to fill up all you vehicles and gerry cans as it is expected that this storm will reek havoc on fuel prices. I think the word I heard was the 16% of the U.S. gas supply comes from that region. It will be some time before they are back up producing... HH
