I knew it was a good fishing lake years ago, but I was excited to see what I could pull out of the lake.  First, here's our new home away from home...just 70 minutes door to door from our house.  [/img]   The boat is very happy to be slipped here instead of in the garage!   I've been out fishing for about 4 hours total over the course of a few days, but managed a small Muskie, some pike, and a few smallies literally just out from where the docks are.  I think I'll like fishing this lake!  So much to explore still and I'm starting to figure out where they are hiding.  Hopefully will find the odd big fish here and there but for now I'm happy with what I've found so far!         The great news is the park allows for free winter storage and a seasonal boat slip is only $300...a bargain as far as I'm concerned!!"
1013160,BFSC Kevin,2017-09-10 20:36:00,1351,Congrats Cliff. I went there for the first time this year and it wasn't that great for me. But I'm glad to hear you're doing well
1013162,Terry,2017-09-10 20:46:00,14456,nice
1013167,Old Ironmaker,2017-09-10 21:16:00,8243,"That looks great, congrats I know you will love it, I would.  I have a plan. We are going to go to a few RV shows this spring. My wife ""hates"" trailers, she thinks the old pop ups her family had when she was a kid and was shared with 2 adults and 3 kids are what a trailer is today. Not anymore my dear. I would love a nice one and I bet she changes her mind. We rented one last month with the boys for 3 nights fishing. It was total luxury including stackable washer dryer and dishwasher. Plus my boat was slipped not 20' away. You only stay in them to sleep or if there's a storm. An auto awning with screening and a big flat screen even when it was raining we stayed outside. Better one here than in FLA. I see a trailer like yours in my crystal ball. Plus no grass to cut!!!!  Enjoy"

1013172,misfish,2017-09-10 22:11:00,29133,"Which park Cliff ? Thats a sweet little , away from home."
1013175,ccmtcanada,2017-09-10 23:43:00,7971,"Meadows End or Layzee Acres???  Which park Cliff ? Thats a sweet little , away from home.  It's Layzee Acres."
1013176,Garnet,2017-09-10 23:52:00,2056,When you get pass the bridge it's idle all the way to next lake if you like your lower unit.  Well there is a way to run it. Almost as scary.
1013177,ccmtcanada,2017-09-11 00:07:00,7971,I'm aware of the danger zones and my navionics maps have the shoals and rocks mapped out pretty well.   The people in the park also shares important info!
1013188,Big Cliff,2017-09-11 09:00:00,6899,"Well first of all, nice to see you posting again and second, congrats on the new ""home away from home"" !"
1013190,lookinforwalleye,2017-09-11 11:03:00,4399,Welcome to Lazyzee Acres nice park Alex and Prisca are great  I have been there for 7 years...All the golf carts running around are a giant PIA but what can you do!!!
1013226,kickingfrog,2017-09-11 20:12:00,8333,"Nothing wrong with the simpler trailers from my youth but geeze those modern ones are high society. Very nice Cliff, hope to see more in the future."
1013248,ccmtcanada,2017-09-12 01:15:00,7971,"Thanks everyone!  We love it there.  Very happy with how it all happened.  Wasn't ""in the plan"", but the opportunity came up and we took it."
