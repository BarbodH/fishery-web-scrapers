1013227,manitoubass2,2017-09-11 20:19:00,11391,Gotta do it bro! Gets down to the 8ft strike zone for panfish 1/8000 of a second faster lol

1012647,buick14,2017-09-04 00:03:00,741,"Hey  I remember as a child mr twister was a big deal, and caught a lot of fish (or so it seemed).  Nowadays with salt impregnated baits, garlics, coffee etc I find myself asking this question ?  Mr Twister are durable, smell like plastic/rubber, and aren't exactly the cheapest out there by any means.  Is this something intermediate anglers use, or is it more of a beginner used brand nowadays?"
1012648,porkpie,2017-09-04 00:17:00,2521,"I use mister twister ripple tails or whatever they are called almost every time I jig for pickerel, that or a fin s fish.  I'm a pretty intermediate fisherman in my opinion, but I've been using them for 35 years or more at least."
1012649,GBW,2017-09-04 00:31:00,8460,I have found better for less price in my eyes.  I also like a bigger body.
1012650,manitoubass2,2017-09-04 00:55:00,11391,I use the red body white tail ones for pike often. Only one I use though  Much prefer kalins and yum grubs
1012651,buick14,2017-09-04 01:42:00,741,"Yah...Kalins are very very nice, and yums are good (but not Kalins good though)..."
1012653,Acountdeleted,2017-09-04 01:53:00,2562,"I add the 2 inch teenie to the back treble hook of all my crank baits. Works like a charm.  Oh, and up north the 3 inch chartreuse for walleye and 4 inch for northerns baited with a minnow always did the trick."
1012655,OhioFisherman,2017-09-04 02:02:00,6623,"No idea if people still use them, but I made my own pony head jigs and sassy shads worked well on them, for bass or crappie.  Their hog frog made a good trailer on a spinner or buzz bait."
1012656,Broker,2017-09-04 02:03:00,482,Use the 3 inch Mr Twisters for river walleye. Its the only option at the local tackle store for white grubs however
1012657,Moosebunk,2017-09-04 03:21:00,3970,Absolutely still use them!
1012660,Big Cliff,2017-09-04 09:00:00,6899,"Still think a 3"" mister twister on a 3/8 oz jig is the best walleye bait out there"
1012662,buick14,2017-09-04 12:39:00,741,Very interesting thanks for the responses so far
1012750,DJGeneral,2017-09-05 17:59:00,163,I still use them to jig for walleye or if I don't wanna get my hands dirty when trolling using earie dearie's I slap those on instead of a night crawler works like a charm!
1012751,Acountdeleted,2017-09-05 18:02:00,2562,The second part of this is news to me. Can't wait to try that trick. Thanks.

1012800,DJGeneral,2017-09-06 12:05:00,163,Trust Me Jeremy try it you wont be disappointed!  PS kinda new to the board not too sure how to do that quote thing you guys do!
1012802,AKRISONER,2017-09-06 12:54:00,5558,was at crappy can last night and they have rebranded and are pushing a wide selection of twister tails...i sure as hell dont use em though.
1012920,Rizzo,2017-09-07 22:34:00,4754,"The mister twister was a fantastic discovery I made around 40 years ago. As a kid my ""opa"" and I always trolled for pike using Williams Wobblers. One day I saw a Mr. Twister with a little silver spinner in his tackle box...an early precursor to a ""spinner bait"". I decided to troll that thing...outfished Grandpa so bad he soon switched. Both of us trolling Beetle Spins or whatever the heck they called em. I don't use them anymore, but it sure taught me spinnerbaits catch fish"
1012949,manitoubass2,2017-09-08 01:55:00,11391,^^^dutch???
1012969,Acountdeleted,2017-09-08 12:02:00,2562,Thanks DJ. I post on my phone so if you click on the persons post a button that says 'quote' will be in the bottom right'
1012991,DJGeneral,2017-09-08 15:28:00,163,no worries man!   Ps the quote didn't work lol
1013007,buick14,2017-09-08 21:20:00,741,Ya I also wondered if people still used them in that beetle spin type configuration also for anything other than crappie and rockbass .  Man things have really changed tho...
1013157,Bass Tard,2017-09-10 19:25:00,128,I still scoop the double tails for spinnerbait trailers 100% of the time.
1013218,jimmer,2017-09-11 16:32:00,2730,I still use the white twisters now.  I switched back after Yum seemed to change the composition of theirs.  Yum seems to be too stiff and the tail doesn't have the same action. I also like the smaller size at times.
1013221,buick14,2017-09-11 18:35:00,741,"I'm glad to hear people are still using it, it's always nice to see a company have such staying power after all these years.  From what I know and have seen, at least in terms of the single tail grub, the quality hasn't seemed to change much if at all since I was a child."
1013222,grimsbylander,2017-09-11 19:00:00,3016,"If you aren't paying $10 a bag for your plastics and throwing them on $500 rods and $300 reels there's zero chance you'll ever catch a fish. Oh, and don't forget to use tungsten jig heads only."
