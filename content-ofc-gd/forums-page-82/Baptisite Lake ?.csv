It is nice to be back on,  I would love it if anyone could share some info on September fishing on good ole Baptiste Lake, heading up there at the end of September, I used to go up there a lot, but its over 10 years. Just looking for any general comments you may have, I am expecting the pike are everywhere, I would love to find some walleye.  Thank you Greg"

1013563,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2017-09-17 01:48:00,535,Yeah the fishing has really went downhill in recent years. Even the bass fishing isn't like it was when I was a kid.

1013636,canoecarrier,2017-09-18 08:07:00,54,"They aren't kidding, that lake is very slow now. You might find a couple of pike if you are lucky, but you really have to find the fish there."
