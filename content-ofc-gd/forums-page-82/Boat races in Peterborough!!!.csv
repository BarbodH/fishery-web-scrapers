1012433,Weeds,2017-08-31 17:54:00,782,Wow. Little lake is tiny and for the most part pretty shallow. I would of thought high horse power boats would tear it up pretty good.
1012667,esoxansteel,2017-09-04 15:11:00,1307,"a bowl lake not very long or wide, poor choice for boat racing, longer lakes ie Chemong would be better IMO, lots of recreational activity on the lake ie yaks, canoes and stand up paddle boards, plus a fountain in the middle, and a fire works platform slightly south of the fountain, plus the odd drunk and Fentanyl user who also think they can swim, and suddenly appear in the water as well, usually by the art gallery, watch out for the occasional dead Musky as well caught by anglers who dont work and cant afford release tools or proper musky gear,"
1012711,Weeds,2017-09-04 22:27:00,782,"You've summed up little lake pretty well. I still have a soft spot for it though. Vegetation seems to have changed in it over the past 10 years, not saying I ever experienced fantastic fishing in it but don't believe it is what  it once was."

1013427,hirk,2017-09-14 22:31:00,571,"Reminder the boat drags are this weekend. To those suggesting its a poor venue the races have been held there in the past and attracted close to 10,000 spectators once according to the Peterborough examiner. The fountain will be shut off during the races for the crowds viewing pleasure"
