1013141,misfish,2017-09-10 17:08:00,29133,"So before I open this thing up, will parts spring out on me ?  Yesterday I was casting with no issues then all of a sudden, I had a birds nest that was not coming out. It just free spooled on a cast. So I want to see if I can repair it myself. Maybe just needs a cleaning and maybe new washers, if there are any.       Those with the know how, please help.  Thanks  B"
1013142,zeeter,2017-09-10 17:15:00,92,There are maintenance tutorials on YouTube which explain the best. For replacement parts order through Mike's Reel Repair.  Great service and Canadian.

I have a spare spool for mine, I would run 14 XT on it for Salmon/Trout rigging and also had a spare spool loaded with heavy dacron for Muskie back then. Just take a dime and remove the screws with the coin size slots, the end comes off, dump out the spool and slip the other one in and put the end back on. Really wasn't any more difficult than changing a spinning reel."
