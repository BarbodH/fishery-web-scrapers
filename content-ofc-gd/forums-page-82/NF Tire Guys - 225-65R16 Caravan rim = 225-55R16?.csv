1013054,Raycaster,2017-09-09 15:10:00,528,(NON-FISHING sorry)  Bought some tire/rims off kijiji and got home before realizing they aren't exactly the same.  My current tires are 225/65/R16 and I bought a used set of 4 @ 225/55/R16.  I just need the rims (Have a good set of winter tires without rims) and I'm pretty sure they are the right bolt pattern.  Just wondering if the 55 - 66 is a tire spec and not really a rim detail.  Thanks ahead.

1013058,Old Ironmaker,2017-09-09 15:27:00,8243,"If I'm not mistaken the second number 55 or 65 is the thickness ratio of the width of the tire. Yep, just the height. The rim would be identical. A 255 tire will not fit a 215 rim for example."
1013060,GBW,2017-09-09 15:40:00,8460,"lower profile on the 'new to you' tires.  So let's say your current wheels come to you knee, the others will be slightly lower than that spot on your knee.  Changes fuel use and slightly the actual speed you are going."

If you just need the rims and not the tires they will be fine, assuming you are confident that the bolt pattern is correct. If they are good tires keep them or resell them. the only difference is the height. The second number 55 or 65 is the aspect ratio meaning that the height is either 65% or 55% of the tire width...PM me if you have any other questions.."
1013063,Raycaster,2017-09-09 16:06:00,528,"Thanks guys, I was hoping it was a tire size and not actual rim dimension.  BTW, the engineers that came up with the idea of putting shiny tin caps on the lugnuts should be &*&&&*&*&*&...."

A 255 tire will not fit a 215 rim for example. Yep, the 1st number is Width, in this case the tire is 225mm wide, the 2nd number is the profile of the sidewall as a % of the Width, 65 for the current ones would be a profile of 146.25mm from the inside edge (Where the Tire meets the Rim) to the outside edge (Tire Thread) while the ""new"" tires with the profile of 55 would be 123.75mm, the R Number is the Rim size in Inches, in this case it's 16 Inch Rims for both sets.

Lots of replies which are all technically correct but Raycaster clearly stated he wants to mount his current tires on the new rims so the new tire size is really not the question.  He is not planning to mismatch or run the lower profile tires.   Both sets of tires are the same diameter (16"") and same width (225 mm) so assuming the wheel offset and bolt pattern are the same the rims should be fine.  The 55 vs 65 aspect ratio has no bearing on it."
