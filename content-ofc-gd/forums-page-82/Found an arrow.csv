1012968,buick14,2017-09-08 10:37:00,741,^^ thats what I wanna know how/why vs scrapped
1012972,FloatnFly,2017-09-08 12:07:00,1640,"They were ordered to be scrapped, someone apparently snuck away one of them and it hidden somewhere, then there was the rumour of a missing prototype"
1012974,FloatnFly,2017-09-08 12:14:00,1640,"That article does a poor job of explaining what exactly was found, this one is better,  the test models are only 3 metres long not full size aircraft  http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/avro-arrow-test-model-found-in-lake-ontario-expedition-team-1.3580009"
