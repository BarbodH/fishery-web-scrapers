1013566,Raycaster,2017-09-17 03:03:00,528,Chasing the big fish Tuesday on Lake St. Clair but trying to solve another problem that probably will affect my Navionics soon.  I own a Samsung Note 2 that is getting old 4.4.2 but works pretty ok.  I'm constantly yelling at my kids for breaking theirs and of course needing upgrades to the latest and greatest.  As mentioned my phone is scratch free but stuck on Android 4.4.2 (discontinued) which is slowly making it unable to run the latest apps.  I use Teamsnap as I coach some high school teams and now it requires 5.0 minimum which is Bull but I can only wonder how long Navionics will work unitl they need a more updated OS too.   My question is hoping there is a android cell phone geek (I mean this nicely) that could assist me if I run into problem installing custom 5 or 7 roms.   What a racket the cell phone companies got running! I have a perfectly fine phone but must get a new one anyways!
