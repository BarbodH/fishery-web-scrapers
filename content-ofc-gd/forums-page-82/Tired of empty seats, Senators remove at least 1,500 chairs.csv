1013294,Toronto_Angler,2017-09-13 00:28:00,698,IMO millionaire hockey players and owners can do what they want as long as they pay for it. When they use public money to fund their stadiums thats when I have a problem.

1013303,kickingfrog,2017-09-13 01:13:00,8333,"What's the logic behind that?  I would prefer to drive a little further and into Suburbia and avoid the big city congestion and stress, expensive parking or the Go Train to watch my team.  There are a few hundred thousand of us scattered for hundreds of kms around the horse shoe and over 2 million people living within the mass transit system. Sure, a few thousand of us make the trip each game maybe but the bulk of the people in the building game in, game out either live and/or work in Toronto proper.  Another component to this is that most of those core Toronto people will not travel the ""other way"" to sporting events when they are in suburbia."
1013305,kickingfrog,2017-09-13 01:27:00,8333,"  I think some of the US teams are in suburban locations eg. NY Islanders.  Yes, we should look to the US for the best practises for urban planning and hockey arenas.  The Islanders were in Nassau County (suburban NYC) and struggled for years. They moved to Brooklyn (the bulk of the hockey fans there are already Ranger fans) they also play in a building not built for hockey and have struggled there as well. Small rink too, 15  odd thousand seats.  Sure there are rinks in suburbia. Owners pit one municipality against another and get such a great deal they don't care about the fans. Edmonton's owner threatened to move to get a better deal. Calgary, with the help of Bettmen, did the same thing today."

I lived north of Hyde Park in the 70's and commuted from the plant in Hamilton. I could make it there in 40 minutes, or less if hammering it if I had a promise. Now it's 40 minutes from downtown Hamilton to the GO station in Burlington at 8AM, crazy."

When they were playing more consistent and not changing coaches every year they had great attendance and a much higher season ticket base. Anselmi said it had nothing to do with the team being ridiculed last playoff for not selling out a game. I call total Bull on that one. It's all about being able to say we had more sellouts this year. Now he says the building is too big for the market, but I guess it wasn't for the previous 20 years when the population was even less.  Cheers"
1012935,kickingfrog,2017-09-08 00:39:00,8333,"I get the scarcity and what that does to someone's perception, but tarping 1500 (or more) of the cheapest seats is a miss.  If this scheme ""works"" they still don't sell as many seats as before (All those Leafs and other Canadian team sell-outs) and sell 0 beers, hotdogs and Leafs souvenirs to those 1500 seats every game.  There is a cost to the team per patron (things like cleaning and staffing). They are not closing off a level or washrooms so there will be no savings. There is also a revenue value tied to each person in the building. All they've done is restricted themselves. The price was too high versus the product value and they chose to hide behind a curtain tarp."
