1013362,Icefishingjim,2017-09-14 00:48:00,2,Looking to head out on an ice fishing trip this coming February. I'm willing to travel within 3-4hours of Algonquin provincial park and looking to rent a cottage of some sort. The group I'm going with is looking to target pike through the ice the whole week we are gone. Any lakes or river with good pike ice fishing anyone would recommend? Thanks!

1013424,Icefishingjim,2017-09-14 22:19:00,2,"Located just outside London, ONT.  Not looking to drive much more than 7-8hours. So far Elephant lake looks very promising (although its impossible to find a cabin for rental there!) and crowe lake in Marmora looks good as well."
1013456,GBW,2017-09-15 04:12:00,8460,"Located just outside London, ONT. Not looking to drive much more than 7-8hours. Now that is a good answer for more help going forward.  You could have been in Ottawa and ppl would have offered other places closer to QC.  Me I got nothing but I bet you get more replies or PM's now that you said where you are and total travel time.  Good luck either way!"

1013487,jimmer,2017-09-15 16:11:00,2730,Did you check with Silver Springs Cottages?

As for your question, there are many pike caught in Cooks Bay and also in Lake Couchiching. Rental huts are plentiful."
