There are definitely walleye in the lake, possibly a somewhat healthy population from what I hear. She's not exactly experienced enough to know where to start, I'm sure she's tried many spots that are just barren. So I'm headed there soon to scope out the lake, see if I can get into some walleye.  That said I hope someone here has fished the lake successfully and can give me some pointers! Any help is appreciated."
