Each year we make these trips and catch some great fish. Last season we broke 5lbs and this trip we broke it twice and crept so close to 6lbs. I landed a half dozen 4lb class fish and even got my Dad, Papa and Uncle out for there first Laker's. What a blast is a understatement! The trip started with dept's 2-3' above normal with wicked current from rain's back in early August. The bite shallow was great as bays with 1-2' of water had 4-5' of depth. I struck out with the biggest of the trip on day 1 using as always my PTL Plastics. The swim jig (1/2oz) with the 4.8"" swinging hammer cut down 1"" in length caught 5% of the fish. The same swimbait texas rigged caught the other 5% and 90% of this trip was pitching my little Texas-Rig Jig craw. The jig bite was crap so I pitched the craw in deep weed for the first time and it was flawless. Water dropped 3-4 days into the trip and it fell quick 2.5-3' to be exact. I followed the fish to the deep weed and fished as many miles as I could. Enjoy the pics guys, I'll post part 1 of my 3 part series below and well add the next and the next to the thread as I release them on YouTube.  Big fish of the trip    Second shot of the beast little over 5-1/2lbs   Second biggest of the trip little smaller by 2 ounces. Longer fish however.   Second shot of the second beast!   High 4lbr 2 ounces under 5 such a wicked trip cant put it into words   Mid 4lbr off rock/weed kinda banks   Last day of the trip cracked a 4-1/2lbr on that TRJ.   Smallmouth were tricky but the morning bite was stupid for me. Back's of bays mid lake humps. All I could do is cast around schooling baitfish on the surface and the smallies were there. 90% on the Vision 110+1 and a couple fish on the Dog-X Speed Slide topwater. Lot's of fun got to put em in the livewell or the school spooks and it's a 1 fish scene. Had some great mornings 6-8am kinda action  4lbs 5oz and a low to mid 3lbr best 2 out of the 3 or 4 we got that half hour.   Big fish one morning little over 4lbs   Another pair not 4's but beauty's none the less!   Another piggy topwater if I remember correctly   Dad's biggest of the trip, his first 4lb smallie was stoked for him.   Couple largies Dad caught thru the trip. Was a tough go no frog water for the boys this year but they picked up a few behind me! He loves the swim jig always produces for him.   And another!   More beautiful deep weedline largemouth   Another 30' down and another small tank   Lake Trout time. My goal was to taste a lake trout for the first time and get one on the line for my Papa, Uncle and Dad. My papa has health issues and couldn't reel his in but he got to enjoy the fight and see the fish. All 4 times I went out I got 1 or 2 fish all kicked back strong and fast and every one let out air on the way up. Fish were caught all on Lead Core 50-70' down and every fish was mixed into schools of bait. What a blast these fish are glad I gave it a go a handful of times!   My Papa's fish I just fought it out. Keep your health guys it's all we have.   Dad's   Uncle's   And 1 more for me   Back to the bass here was a even 4-0 on the TRJ. Never got a bite deeper than 11' most fish were 6-9' deep shallower weedlines seemed to produce best. If you had a bay behind ya it was a guarantee fish would pull to the edge as the water fell.   Morning piggy on the swimbait   Here is the video I posted this evening. Part 1 of a 3 part series   Part 2   Part 3    LakeTrout    Thanks for reading and checking out the report everybody! It was a exciting 13 days out there. I'll post the next 2 video's in the coming 2 weeks as they are released.  Tightlines and go bassin it's been on fire!  MTBF"
