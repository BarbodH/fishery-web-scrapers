A great sign because I do not think all of these fish are part of the annual migration, I hope they are locals. This has been a fantastic year here on Erie. Limits are not a problem, even for me!! It usually is Bass time unless one ventures west of Long Point, not this year. We usually have to go as far west as Leamington in September. As long as they are here we will be trying to slam em'. Hope the winds co operate this week."
