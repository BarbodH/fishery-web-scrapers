But I have an inflatable with a trolling motor.  I see there is a town launch across from the beer store, but that is RIGHT in town. So I'm afraid of having to deal with the wakes of speeding boats and jet skis. And this would be on a Saturday.  Do you know if there are any hand launches on the Notty just outside the busy parts of the river? Somewhere that you can set up right next to the launch so I don't have to carry a battery and a bunch of gear a mile to the river?  I like to fish for bass and pike.  I saw Jack's Lake and it's accessible from the sports park, but judging by pics and the lack of rain the last few weeks, I have a feeling the trek from the launch to the lake won't be good for my rig. Too low I would imagine.  Don't mind a PM if that would be better.  Thanks for any tips."
