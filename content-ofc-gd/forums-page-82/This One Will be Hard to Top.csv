1013308,FloatnFly,2017-09-13 02:17:00,1640,"New PB on the fly rod, and possibly all tackle PB.  an absolute beast, super thick, strong as all get out, i could barely get my hand half way around its tail, and im 6'4, my arms are tired.  he did not give in til he beached himself, and even then, he tried to beaver tail his way back, giving me a mud shower in the process, was covered head to toe with mud!  but, what a great fish    "
1013310,Old Ironmaker,2017-09-13 02:28:00,8243,"He's a beast for sure. Congrats to you Sir. I only wish. On a fly! I don't want to give you the standard ""nice fish."" It deserves more thought than that."
1013318,FloatnFly,2017-09-13 12:03:00,1640,"Thank OI, I was sure my line was going to break since I don't use heavy tippets maybe 8lb at most"
1013335,GBW,2017-09-13 16:12:00,8460,"how'd it taste? JK!  that's one big fish, congrats"
1013340,AKRISONER,2017-09-13 18:44:00,5558,ive been dreaming of this lately...hopefully just a salmon any salmon will eat my fly on the swing soon!  Congrats i couldnt even imagine the fight.
1013352,misfish,2017-09-13 20:58:00,29133,Thats a pig. Nicely done.
1013360,FloatnFly,2017-09-14 00:03:00,1640,"The fight was awesome, 20 minutes,  the fish made me feel like I was in control of it, and then it would take off, and make me realize that it was in control and there wasn't much I could do.  At the end, he accidently beached himself, so ran down and grabbed on, got him flipped around, then got the beaver tail treatment, was covered head to toe in mud"
1013369,reydold,2017-09-14 08:38:00,10,I'm sure you still had a great time. That's a nice fish!
