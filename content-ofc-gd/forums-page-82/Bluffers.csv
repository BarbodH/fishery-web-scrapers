1002656,John Bacon,2017-05-08 23:38:00,3277,Has anyone seen Bluffers this week?  How are the ramps?  They were supposed to be closed down for maintenance last fall.  Has that been completed?  Any luck with fishing?
1002670,mikeh,2017-05-09 02:37:00,824,"I was down there today, , the ramps are blocked off, they haven't finished the work because of the water levels, the walking path to tie the boats off after launching is under water."
1002672,John Bacon,2017-05-09 02:45:00,3277,"Thanks, I guess I won't be heading there tomorrow."
1002725,hunteronwheels,2017-05-09 18:45:00,112,was there today they are still underwater
1004038,mikeh,2017-05-21 03:07:00,824,"since May 08, the water levels are up 5-6 inches in my estimation. the marina is kind of strange  looking because the boats are tied up at their slips but the docks look like they are underwater."

1013366,mikeh,2017-09-14 02:01:00,824,"launch still has not been fixed although the water has gone down, also I went down to the Rouge at port union and the gate was still locked to drive down to the parking anybody have any idea if they are going to open these areas this year?"
1013380,John Bacon,2017-09-14 14:08:00,3277,"launch still has not been fixed although the water has gone down, also I went down to the Rouge at port union and the gate was still locked to drive down to the parking anybody have any idea if they are going to open these areas this year?  The gate to the Rouge was open earlier this month.  I am not sure why they would have closed it again.  I am resigned to Bluffers not opening at all this year.  It would be nice if I turn out to be wrong on that one."
