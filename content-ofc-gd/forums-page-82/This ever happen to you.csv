1013139,glen,2017-09-10 16:50:00,2641,Congrats Terry. You should have had breakfast delivered and kept fishing.
1013140,misfish,2017-09-10 17:03:00,29133,Congrats Terry. You should have had breakfast delivered and kept fishing.  Exactly.

1013153,manitoubass2,2017-09-10 18:38:00,11391,Loved the stories of her on LOTWs lodge slaying off the dock!
1013179,porkpie,2017-09-11 00:13:00,2521,"You've got brass ones pal!  If I so much as looked at fishing pole on my anniversary my head would be on a pike.  Mind you, it's a small price to pay for all the other fishing nonsense she puts up with, and my anniversary is in the winter."
1013180,SirCranksalot,2017-09-11 00:19:00,3291,"If I came back with fish, no problem!! If not, a BIG prob!"

1013231,dave524,2017-09-11 20:49:00,4508,"Thanks for the reminder, ours is the 15th and she has a birthday on the 13th, the big six OOOOOOO. She don't read here, I hope"
1013233,Old Ironmaker,2017-09-11 21:34:00,8243,"Can't say I have ever done that. But I did make a breakfast in bed for my former wife for her 30th birthday, card, gift and all. Only to find out I had the right day but wrong month, at least early not late. These birthdays, anniversaries and the like are all very over rated anyway. Invented by women for women. Kind of like the DeBeers of diamond fame coming up with this diamond engagement ring deal to sell more diamonds, what a scam, and we buy into it."
1013237,Headhunter,2017-09-11 22:24:00,5703,"Well Terry, that's something of yours that you haven't broke! Congratulations to you both and I wish you another 40 years of un-broken happiness! HH"

LMAO  They say, for better or worse. Sickness and health, golfing or fishing,,,,,,,,   I DO  LOL"
1013241,lew,2017-09-11 22:55:00,12766,"We'll be married 51 years next month and I can honestly say I've never forgotten our anniversary, I did however forget Valentines Day one time and that was pretty near as bad as forgetting an anniversary LOL"
