Throw them in a cage and bring them with you and get the Hell out. The birds are safer in the back seat than home. I need to know how many birds is worth a human life? Idiots, they are both idiots and if they live through it there will be another natural disaster coming their way, me. They are putting their birds ahead of family, idiots is all I can say.  Good point Johnny. I guess it's not only extremely dangerous, it's very inconsiderate of them to put the family members who are sitting around hoping they're ok through such stress. Without power of phones, it could could be a very uneasy time. Feel bad for ya! The rant makes way more sense now too!!"

The Governor of Florida today ordered a mandatory evacuation of Florida residents in their county. The governor said leave now and don't expect I put our rescue workers in harms way to save you after the storm, you were told. They have decided to weather the storm because she has 3 Parrots, no kids. Plus the storm behind Irma, her little brother Jose is going to put them in harms way for weeks. I told her 3 days ago to get out before you can't get out, fell on deaf ears. They are sure the Lord will not forsake them, seriously. I don't think that's how He does business. He gives us the intelligence to make our own path in life. Just today he is running around looking for plywood and a generator, today? They have been there for 25 freaking years and needs plywood today. They found 3 sheets on Craig's List, $600.00 for 1 sheet of 4X8X5/8's. He calls me to ask ""How do you fasten plywood to stucco and concrete?"" Take the big blue Tapcon lag screw you don't have and drive into the front of your brain with a drill. What's a drill?  My sis-in-law isn't a stupid woman she has her PHD. in Nursing and has a big corporate position, bless her but they both have ZERO street sence. The first week they got down there they went into Overton in Miami to pass on their blessings and the word of the Lord got robbed including their car with Ont. plates, lucky that was all they lost, and I warned them 25 years ago. Stupidity isn't anyone but their ancestors fault, it's passed on through DNA, anyone with a semblance of intelligence and does stupid things is just plain ignorant.  It is going to be a long few days, weeks or more seeing my Lady worry herself sick. Some of the in-laws are devout Christians maybe the Lord will send them a log floating by, a boat and a rescue team a then a chopper to get them off the top of their house. Then ask Him why didn't He save them? I am going to stop there.  A short rant, yea right, sorry I can't say what I wrote here to my wife, she doesn't need to hear it from me right now. I just need to say it to someone this late and I pick you guys. Hopefully they will jump on the log.  Johnny D"

The Blizzard of 77' snuck up on us and if you weren't ready for it then you were in trouble especially along Lake Erie. Then there was the fall/winter of 86' where the storm surge swept many cottages into the lake all along the coast.

This was the reasoning why the Houston mayor didn't call for everyone to bolt. People died last time they fled the city and he didn't want to repeat that event.  Not sure what I would do but if I lived in an area that was always seeing hurricanes, there would definitely be metal roll shutters over every window, a garage full of Stabiled gas for the genny and car etc..

We had a place in Port Charlotte up to 11 years ago and sold it to my cousin in Hamilton. I had it ready if there was a hurricane. Better ready than we are here in the case of a Blizzard. Yep the roads are a mess now but no one is running out of gas on them. The Troopers will top up the tank just enough to get you off the highway. I would still leave.    Yes it may move west, the problem is the thing is the size of Texas and is as vulnerable as Texas and Louisiana was 2 weeks ago with the flooding. Not many homes were ripped out with the wind but everyone was trapped because of the rain. Now I have friends and family in his path on the west side in Charlotte Harbor and Naples.   I hope they stay safe my Buckeye friend. I had a place in Charlotte Harbor where I was going to retire to for the winters. Life changes plans change. We insist in putting ourselves in harms way for the sake of lifestyle. Man will never learn.    Exactly, but once this storm has passed, and the next one and the one after that we will do a head count, spend billions to rebuild we will still insist on living in harm's way. What is the definition of insanity again?    We once could until the insurance carrier wouldn't give me fire insurance until I removed the entire and not to code stack from this shack. The last long outage was 5 days during a March ice storm. The NG fireplace came on automatically and there was gas for the stove. Everyone told me don't use the stove as heat. Where does the CO go when we are cooking a big meal and all 5 burners are going and the oven is cooking the Turkey? As long as the NG stays on at least we won't freeze to death or die of starvation with the cistern full. If we lose NG we are in big trouble that is why I wanted to keep the stack up, I had the stove in the shed ready to connect the chimney. I can always go down to the lake and haul buckets of water too unless the place is buried like in 1977. I have an old faded photo of the place and only a bit of the roof is peeking up. It is about 18' high!  I'm shopping for a small generator now. Any recommendations? I need it for a few lights, fridge and the gas forced air furnace."
