222693,Tacklebuster,2008-07-03 16:46:00,303,"I am curious to know if the carp die off is only happening in L.Simcoe, or have any of the Kawartha's been hit as well?"
222716,bbog,2008-07-03 17:26:00,665,Kawarthas got hit really hard last year but I have not heard if they got hit again this year. Does anyone know what is causing this latest die-off?
222722,Zamboni,2008-07-03 17:46:00,235,Seems to be spreading from Simcoe to Couch & Sparrow....haven't heard of any die off in Kawartha's. They sent dead carp to Guelph to be tested-took a long time last year but to check if its same virus should be quicker.  Did it last about 10 days in most lakes last year?
222734,Blue_Axela,2008-07-03 18:09:00,88,No sign of a carp die off on Rice.
222752,Mattitude,2008-07-03 18:33:00,155,I've been fishing at the Narrows the past couple of days and every once in a while I'll see one come floating by out of Simcoe through the Narrows.

222796,Tacklebuster,2008-07-03 20:11:00,303,thanks for the replies
