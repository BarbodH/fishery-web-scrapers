221917,lew,2008-07-01 23:22:00,12767,"As I've mentioned in every musky report so far this year, I like to be positioned on a good spot as the sun breaks the horizon in the morning and so far it's worked out very well for me this season.  I headed out in some pretty dense fog about 5:15 AM on Saturday as my GPS had sunrise at 5:32. I was casting to a weedy point and sure enuff, at 5:45,  I got my morning fish almost right on cue although he was about 13 minutes late....perhaps he missed the actual sunrise because of the heavy fog layer    Sunday morning I thought I'd change things up a bit and decided to troll another good location as the sun broke over the horizon. I took this picture as I was trolling a 10"" Jake over weeds in 8 FOW and the fish hit just a few minutes later.    For the most part I've gotten away from taking fish pictures  while I'm alone in the boat, but both fish were in the 40"" range. The hooks were removed while the fish recuperated in the Frabill and then released without ever leaving the water.  I missed a fish yesterday while day dreaming and not setting the hook fast enuff, but other than those 3 I never saw another musky all week-end even though I spent alot of time on the water from Saturday till this morning. Maybe all this crazy changing weather has got the fish confused too   Still beats goin to work though"
221919,ccmtcanada,2008-07-01 23:24:00,7971,Great stuff Lew!  You've got them hitting by alarm clock...that's pretty amazing!! LOL  Some great sunrise pics too.
221924,Joey,2008-07-01 23:30:00,9122,"Those must be Lew O'Clock fish then  You've got them dialled in by the looks of it Lew, now stop daydreaming, ha ha ha.  Joey"
221927,mattyk,2008-07-01 23:35:00,2110,thanks for the report lew.
221956,BillM,2008-07-02 00:49:00,17367,I think I am going to have to sneak into lews boat one late night if I ever wanna catch one of these suckers  Good job lew!
222006,Bly,2008-07-02 02:43:00,1556,"The more of your reports I read, the more I am thinking that there just might be something to this ""Lew O'Clock"" thing    The sunrise shot is beautiful.  Congrats on the fish Lew"
222127,Reef Runner,2008-07-02 14:26:00,981,"Seems like you got it down to the T Lew.  Good job.  I borrowed that sunrise as my desktop, Beauty pic.  Thanks for sharin."
222149,Clampet,2008-07-02 15:34:00,1947,The Muskies need to be careful around you.
222267,ehg,2008-07-02 22:34:00,2666,"Thanks for the words of wisdom and decent pix. Personally i stopped musky fishing alone. Its easier to catch, land and take picture of musky with a little help. Congrats on the fish, ehg"
222271,Sinker,2008-07-02 22:41:00,8692,Geeze.....talk about having them trained!!  Nice pics Lew!!  Sinker
222294,Musky or Specks,2008-07-02 23:24:00,2710,Im going to start using that technique Lew. No pics again eh. HHHUUMM ever see a movie called Harvey.
222304,lew,2008-07-02 23:55:00,12767,"Thanks everyone   And Musky or Specks, just so you know the technique actually works, here's a pair of back to back muskies from last fall that came within 10 minutes of each other as the sun was poking it's nose over the horizon.  Even the fish like Lew O'clock      As for the pics, I've decided that after all these years it's no longer neccessary to take pictures of every fish that grabs my hook and it's much easier on the fish to leave her in the water and less stress on her too."
222339,fishindevil,2008-07-03 00:37:00,6254,"Nice plan of attack lew !!!!!...and it payed off well,nice sized fish for sure...cheers"
222348,Greencoachdog,2008-07-03 00:51:00,8163,"That done it Lew!!!  I'm not believing any more of these ""fish stories"" until I see some pics!!!  I'm tired of being deprived of readily available fish porn!!!   ... or maybe you're just getting too old to ""cut the mustard""?"
222471,Musky or Specks,2008-07-03 03:59:00,2710,"I hear you Lew. I dont take pictures anymore unless the fish is in the water or is over 40""."
222494,huntervasili,2008-07-03 08:32:00,1604,"Nice pics and report even though there are none of the fish. Looks like you know the fish almost as well as they know you... Probably just trying to bug ya by being late for their meeting, I hate when that happens, too darn often they never show up without notice"
222825,Greencoachdog,2008-07-03 21:29:00,8163," I was just ribbin' you on this one Lew, I'm sure when someone has caught as many as you have they all get to lookin' pretty much the same... and some of them prolly are the same fish you've caught before.  I'm sure if you caught an extra special nice one you take a pic of it for us.  Which brings us to the question of: How long would a Musky have to be, before you would think about taking a pic of it Lew?... over 50""?... over 55""?"
222829,jwl,2008-07-03 21:37:00,1056,"you always have a pretty good tale of the musky adventures along the way, thanks for sharing, funny how you have great luck first thing in the morning, I have gotten most of mine in the mid day hours. I am sure we will hear many more great reports to come..thanks for sharing"
222835,Canuck2fan,2008-07-03 21:41:00,1444, Awesome job on catching something though. I have to agree with the fish being confused by this weather. I have been bass fishing 4 times at my spot and I have NEVER seen a start to the season like this one. I have caught over 30 bass so far but they are all the smaller ones. The big ones just sit there not interested at all. The small ones were hitting so HARD they were tearing the leeches right off the hook I have NEVER seen that either. A leech is usually good for 3 or 4 fish. Strange weather strange seems to equal strange fishing but getting out DOES beat being at work!!!
