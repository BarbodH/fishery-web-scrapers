The 2nd quarter report for this year (Apr, May,Jun) was by far the busiest ever. Each month saw more than 17,000,000 hits. June was our busiest month in all categories, which is unusual for us...normally by this time of year traffic drops off quite a bit.  Last quarter's numbers of interest- 2,700,000 pages viewed. 577,000 visits 160,000 unique visitors. Well over 200Gb of bandwidth was used up. We now have over 211,000 posts by more than 3,300 members"
