Thinking the catch and release or conservation has something to do that.  Started out late Thurs  launched out of View lake public launch at 11.30 am  and headed west around a island not sure of the name ,this area of the Bog is new to me so was just trying to find a pattern that worked. Well no luck even thought it looked good. Headed east up to the narrows and started casting into the shore line just past the 90 deg. turn and the straight . Again no luck. Started heading back right at the turn , then started hitting in 4 Fow in lillys with a bog attached . using spinners and black senkos, throwing past the bog, and lifting and dropping them just as they past the bog.. This pattern seemed to work the best. Wind was blowing heavy so it was difficult to position so just took what was given. Then headed out to the pods just past the turn and drifted into the pods really good spot holding lots of fish ,was thick enough to hold the boat and started tossing into the pods with great success,biggest one today 4.5 lbs but lots in the 2-3 lb range plus many break off witch seemed very heavy at the time. While traveling between the pods was quick retrieving chartreuse double willow spinners and hooked two nice Ski's guessing  mid 30's but both were high jumpers and threw the hook.Dam they hit hard. Lol . Good couple of hours fishing."
222902,mikeh,2008-07-04 00:44:00,824,sounds like it was a great day. When you were getting break offs what pound test were you using.
222906,tbayboy,2008-07-04 00:51:00,1497,Sweet.  Nice to see guys figuring out patterns like that.  Wonder if the break offs were musky thought they seem to be too acrobatic this time of year to just pull and break a line instead of jumping all over the place.
