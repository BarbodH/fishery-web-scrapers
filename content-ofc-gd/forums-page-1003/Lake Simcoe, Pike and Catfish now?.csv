We all know about how the media can sensationalize things, so I was wondering if anyone has any further information in this regard."
223459,fishindevil,2008-07-05 01:08:00,6254,"Im not sure about other species but i seen it on the news tonight,the local residents are now working with the M.N.R and were in the process of removing hundreds of carp from the lake today,they think its a repeat of last year,and they are now watching very closely to see if it spreads to other lakes...its not looking good,so we have to wait for the lab reports now,same as last year,it will take forever...i hope it doesnt spread to other species!!!!!!!"
223464,Tacklebuster,2008-07-05 01:16:00,303,"from what I recall about last years die off, it only effected carp.  Curious about why the same lakes weren't hit again...perhaps the carp developed an immunity to it?"
223466,ccmtcanada,2008-07-05 01:18:00,7971," It made it's way through the Trent system last year....some are thinking that it's just progressing further up as the spread was interrupted by winter.  From what I understand, there is a small natural kill of species every year...until LARGE numbers start showing up, I wouldn't jump to any conclusions."
