If you or someone you know would like to try fishing in Ontario waters for the first time (or the first time in a long time), circle the weekend of July 4-6, 2008 on your calendar. For those three days only (12:01 a.m. Friday to 11:59 p.m. Sunday), Canadian residents can enjoy the fun of fishing in Ontario without a licence during the annual Ontario Family Fishing Weekend.  All other regulations, fees and limits will apply  You must abide by the conservation licence limits set out in the current Ontario Recreational Fishing Regulations Summary, available from fishing licence issuers, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, or online. Your limit on walleye and trout, for example, may be two instead of five or six. Some fish, such as pumpkinseed, have no limit. And, of course, there is no limit to the number of fish you can release.  Events related to this special weekend will take place across the province.  Fishing festivals, clinics, derbies or educational activities may be held in your area. If you would like event information, please contact a tourist information centre near your home or destination, call the OFFW Event Information Line at 705-748-6324 or visit our events page.  Remember, fish with care, and concern for future generations of people and fish!  Anglers:  Please pass this information on to your non-angling friends. Consider supporting a local event or simply introduce someone to the joys of fishing this weekend.  http://www.familyfishingweekend.com/Welcome.cfm"
