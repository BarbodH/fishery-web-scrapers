222930,grt1,2008-07-04 01:53:00,638,"Each spring we get together at Eagle Lake and have a few beers and wet a few lines. My buddies come in from Alberta and Thunder Bay to share some great times with just the boys (ok, we're  old guys, but we're young at heart)  My Buddy Ron has a camp (cottage to you southern ontario guys) and we use 14 and 16 foot boats to brave the waves.  This year we had a little good luck and nailed some really nice walleye, and some lake trout.   here's my buddy Ron running up a creek into our lake trout hole. The fish aren't huge but they are dandy eaters    You can see I'm enjoying being guided instead of having to do all the work.      the previous 2 pictures were Me and Ron showing off our catch.    And of course shore lunch is mandatory when it takes an hour to go up the creek to get to the trout lake. (Beans and weiners and beef stew mixed together, some fresh rye bread and a shot of rye to wash it all down. )    one of the walleye my buddy Dick caught. For a guy from the prairies he sure could catch fish.  Thinking of this weekend is how I make it through the winter."
