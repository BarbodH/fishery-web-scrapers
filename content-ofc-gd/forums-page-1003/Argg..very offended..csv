222682,tonyb,2008-07-03 15:54:00,1637,"Not only was he being a bully, he was breaking the law!  Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation act Obstruction of hunting, trapping or fishing  13.

222692,Anatz,2008-07-03 16:35:00,74,"thanks guys for your concerns, I did fish off Bewdley but next time I will know for sure what to do and say."
222700,wuchikubo,2008-07-03 16:57:00,1114,"For the next time that might happen, take an extra copy of the regs or just the section it applies to it and highlight/circle the species, limit, and other relevant info. Also, wouldn't hurt to have the area Tony mentioned about interfering highlighted. Hand it to the guy and see if he knows how to read or ask him to show you his CO ID.  Try not to get too riled up, I hope you and your mom had some tasty sunfish. (Generally, I would prefer not to eat the fish out of Rice Lake, I find them muddy tasting.)"
222744,TennesseeGuy,2008-07-03 18:18:00,957,I suggest not wasting any more energy on a crazy guy.  Best to join me on fishing trips because I catch all the hell for everybody which would give you a free pass.

222815,Canuck2fan,2008-07-03 21:09:00,1444,"Anatz, You sound like a good son for doing what your mother asked you to do don't let some dill hole ruin it for you.  For what it is worth I had always been told my mother that sunfish are delicious..... my dad always said nope they are a garbage fish too hard to clean. Dad fishes mom never did so I listened to dad. Until last year when I was fishing and deep hooked a sunfish about a lb it was a goner. Since I already 2 smallies for the pan I thought why not try it beats feeding it to the 30 lb snapper that lives in there. I have to say that the sunfish was fabulous very similar to crappie or pumpkinseed. Not hard to fillet at all really when they are size that one was LOL. Now I will have no problem harvesting a few of them from time when I want some fresh fish."
222817,Mark Kulik,2008-07-03 21:13:00,348,"This guy is obviously not very well informed about fish management-, there is nothing wrong with a nice meal of bluegill or crappie-they are prolific spawners and quite plentiful-especially on Rice- I personally don't keep bass or most walleye, but I enjoy a meal once in a while of panfish, next time , just ignore him! keep fishing and have fun!"
222877,Rich,2008-07-03 23:13:00,3927,Sunfish? Yah cuz I can see their populations are in real threat of extinction. LOL  Hand him a copy of the fishing regulations next time. I love a good feed of big bluegills!
222468,Anatz,2008-07-03 03:51:00,74,I was approached by a man and he mentioned to me that I shouldn't take sunfishes home. I never in my entire life took fish home and it was the first time. I only took 5 sunfishes home because my mom wants to eat them. I was quite offended because I see other people keeping fish beside me and they weren't a minority and approached. This was at Rice Lake and sunfishes can sustain themselves. I see tons of people taking crappie home from the pictures I've seen..argg..  Like I do understand that Bass feed on sunfishes and stuff but the situation where I was approached because I was a minority seemed pretty offensive. I read regs and everything yet people still tend to discriminate.
222472,holdfast,2008-07-03 04:02:00,1813,"Antz, I wish you could of told him to mind his own Business and read the Regulations.  I hope you had a taste of the Sunfish, apparently theyre suppose to taste great"
222473,limeyangler,2008-07-03 04:04:00,5204,"Anatz....i am gonna speak up for ya....being "" a person of color"" as i was refered to the other day. I am not in a position to say whether or not you were approached bcause you are a visible minority, but given some of my life experiences i would not doubt it! But dood....wont be the first or last time, hope your ma enjoyed the Sunfish"
222475,Beats,2008-07-03 04:09:00,543,Sunfish thrive in just about any body of water that they are in.  They are usually the first fish seen from shore and while they are a small fish they have huge numbers.  I have never kept any myself just for the simple reason that I would need a whole lot of them to make a decent meal.  I wouldn't feel at all guilty for taking any number of sunfish.  Sounds like you ran into a grumpy man with nothing better to do than stick his nose in other peoples' business.
222479,jace,2008-07-03 04:22:00,472,what was the reason he gave?
222481,GBW,2008-07-03 04:28:00,8460,good on you for giving your mom a tasty snack! I bet he was ticked cause he was skunked while he was there...
222483,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-03 04:32:00,2585,i would have told him your actually going to keep your limit and come back everyday until season ends.  Sorry some dumb a-- gave you a hard time  cheers!
222486,Anatz,2008-07-03 04:54:00,74,"thanks guys! I've caught bass there and I never take them home, but hopefully I'll try to speak up for myself next time. I even told him I never took fish home before but his attitude wasn't friendly at all. Anyways, I'm not trying to point out people but I just feel it wasn't nice at all."
222488,GBW,2008-07-03 04:59:00,8460,"if he comes up to you again, pull out your cell (if it takes pic's) and snap his pic so you have it for the just in case factor.  also, I would point out the fact that you have a valid fishing license and that this is for personal consumption and that you want to see his CO ID.  That is if you feel up to it as some people can just been absolute tools and you never know what they may do..."
222491,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2008-07-03 05:35:00,160,"I am of a minority as well, and I do follow the regs to the dot, no one has ever approached me to tell me any smart comments like this... I don’t think this is a race issue rather than just some loose nuts out there who wish they had some power… sometimes I wish they would just pick on me rather than the guy who wont say anything back because they are being polite.. me on the other hand// before I step on any body of water I read the regs very carefully.. and if anyone did say something smart my bottom half of my shimano would be happy to answer their questions..  It is very unfortunate you had to have this experience, be proud, and if you are doing the right thing then don't worry about anything"
222501,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-03 10:40:00,0,Lots of people take bluegill and sunfish home. Apparently some say they taste the same as crappy but who knows(I cant see how)...I would have told them that you read the regs and seen nothing about not being able to keep sunfish.
222509,Greencoachdog,2008-07-03 11:10:00,8163,"Next time look him straight in the eye and tell him ""No speaky ingrish""!  ... or you could quote him the daily possesion limits for the zone you are fishing and inform him that it's againt the law to harrass/interfere anyone that is fishing by legal methods.  ... or you could really blow his mind and start speaking spanish to him!  ""No comprender english, e no molesta mi pescados... puto!   There's absolutely nothing wrong with keeping a limit of Sunfish, they need to be harvested or they have a tendency to become stunted. The meat is very sweet and delicious!"
222516,danbo,2008-07-03 11:21:00,2646,Maybe he was jealous because you caught more fish than him. Next time ask him if He's a Conservation Officer & show me your badge. Otherwise tell him to drift or you'll call the Police! If I was with ya I'd hand you his teeth!

222572,Stoty,2008-07-03 12:52:00,2910,"I totally agree.   Being the Rice Lake area, it was probably just some redneck hick thinking he knows it all and was talking out his   .  You have a fishing licence...so you are entitled (just like everyone else) to keep a certain amount of fish. Not to mention that sunfish are classified as ""panfish"" which have no limit. So keep as many as you want!  BTW...sunfish are excellent eating. You just need a little patience to clean the suckers!"
222573,holdfast,2008-07-03 12:57:00,1813," Good Attitude, for every one of those Idiots, theres at least 50 good guys.  Good fishing"
222597,Blue_Axela,2008-07-03 13:30:00,88,"Lots of idiots on Rice Lake...  Honestly, take as many sunfish home as you want on Rice.  There are plenty of them and I can't fish off my dock without having them go after my lure.  The Americans come to Rice every year and take 200 panfish home...and he's giving you trouble about 5?"
222607,LeXXington,2008-07-03 13:55:00,1928,"Some people think just cause someone is of different colour they are ""rapeing"" the resourse.  If you have a fishing tag or are under age, take a picture and post it here so we can tell him a thing or 2 about fishing regs.  Take as many sunfish as you want under the regs. Don't worry they will make more, and more and more and more.......  Sunfish taste great (so I was told) just not so fun to clean."
222627,danbo,2008-07-03 14:13:00,2646,The guy was obviously a bully!
222630,Marko,2008-07-03 14:17:00,854, You didnt have to explain yourself to him. Its none of his business how much fish you decide to take home as long as you are within the regs. I dont know why is it so hard for people to mind their own damn business.
222640,Blue_Axela,2008-07-03 14:28:00,88,"Just curious,  where did you fish off of?  Bewdley?"
222641,Mike Pike,2008-07-03 14:29:00,1332,"I hope that person's comments didn't ruin your day, Antz, or your Mom's enjoyment of her meal of fresh caught fish.  I believe I'm gonna start targeting sunnies for the frypan this year too.  Cheers Bud!"
222649,Greencoachdog,2008-07-03 14:47:00,8163," That is the exact same impression I got!  ... and my comment about not speaking english was to give you the oppertunity to ignore this confrontational  He was trying to ruin your trip, and it sounds like he did a fair job of it... despicable!!!"
222654,bbog,2008-07-03 14:55:00,665,A fishing buddy once told me his mom would crawl on broken glass for a meal of Sunfish. Haven't tried it myself but do a lot of camping weekends and will next time I get sick of having Pike  Keep on fishing and ignore the ..........!
