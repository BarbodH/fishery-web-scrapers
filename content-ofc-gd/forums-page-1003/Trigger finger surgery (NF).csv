222637,LeXXington,2008-07-03 14:24:00,1928,"Is this a ""pull my finger joke""  had my pinky finger rebent. took a long time to become strong enough to use,"
222702,mattmacewan,2008-07-03 16:59:00,18,Triggers and Dupuytren's are completely different.  Dupuytren's may completely curl up or not at all it's quite an individual thing...most surgeons wont touch you until their about a third curled but it's doc specific.
222833,aplumma,2008-07-03 21:40:00,6896,Well the surgery was 2 hours late but it all looks like it went well. Joe is home with his hand in a soft bandage and full of painkillers. He is slurring his speech a little and smiling allot so I think he is still high as a kite. The doc gave him some oxycodone I will wait till he goes to sleep before I start the auction for them bad boys. All in all he should be coherent Friday and post his own report.  Art
222842,irishfield,2008-07-03 21:52:00,26272,Thanks Art ! If that don't work... I'm sure Dawg musta left something behind that will cure him. lol
222845,Rich Clemens,2008-07-03 21:59:00,3131,Good Deal Art.  I wonder if Joe can type with just one finger
222851,Roy,2008-07-03 22:11:00,13728,"Thanks for the update, Art."
222852,jwl,2008-07-03 22:12:00,1056,"hope there is a speedy recovery , about 10 years ago I had to have carpal tunnel surgery, spent months not being able to fish, it really sucked man, and way too much time in physio.  best of luck with everything and hope ya get back at it very soon"
222910,Daplumma,2008-07-04 01:00:00,1961,"Thanx for all of the concerns.I'm doing just fine.They shot my whole hand up with novacaine and I still cant feel my finger.No pain killers yet but might take one tonight cause when that Novacaine wears off it mat sting a bit.There have been some discussions about health care on the forum lately so I will tell the story about this problem. I got back from The GTG on Sunday the 22nd of June.I walked into the docs office(was in the neighborhood) on the 24th.Had an appointment on the 25Th.They looked at my records,took an x'ray and set me up for Surgery on the 26th.I told them I needed more time as I had work set up for that date.I chose the following Thursday (today) and other than a surgery gone long before me it was all good.My surgery was set for 1:15,they told me it would be a 2 hour delay.They put me under at 2:30 and I was out the door at 3:15.My total out of pocket will be $348.00.Its not always a nightmare down here.Not trying to restart a big discussion here,just a little insight into how this case was handled.Thanx again for the kind concern..y'all rock! Joe"
222925,Greencoachdog,2008-07-04 01:37:00,8163,Glad to hear doing well Bubba Joe!  Man that joy juice they put you under with will make hours fly by in an instant eh!  Was this the hand that suffered the dog bite?
222942,John,2008-07-04 02:28:00,2956,Glad things went well Joe. Fast recovery bud...
222980,tjsa,2008-07-04 09:45:00,1578,"Thanks for the update Joe, that is indeed fast service. Up here, it would probably be 6 months from initial Dr.'s visit to surgery, although usually completely free of cost. Remember I spoke with you about my bud's knee surgery(similar to yours). It didn't work out, he has to go back for more, doc told him that last December, and the surgery appointment is for this coming September!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
222981,Rich Clemens,2008-07-04 09:49:00,3131,Attaboy Joe.  Kia said she would come down and give it a few licks to help the healing process.
223012,lew,2008-07-04 11:32:00,12767,Good to hear everything worked out OK for ya Joe.
223018,ccmtcanada,2008-07-04 11:40:00,7971,"Glad to hear it went well!  I just hope when you wake up that you still have some painkillers running through your system!  When I had my wisdom teeth removed, I fell asleep when I got home and didn't pop my painkillers.  When the freezing wore off I ran to get my tylenol 3s....and then paced back and forth for 10 minutes until they kicked in...LOL.  Here's hoping for a speedy recovery!!"
223032,tjsa,2008-07-04 12:06:00,1578," I slipped, and broke my right wrist back in 97, out scouting for moose.  Drove back into town with my wrist throbbing, to emergency. The pain wasn't much to deal with until the nurses ""modified"" the position of my wrist to get proper x-rays(damn, that hurt)!!!!!!!!!!  The emerg doc prescribed T3's also. I interpreted that to mean drink 3 Toby's(beer), and I did. Never filled out the prescription."
223035,John,2008-07-04 12:15:00,2956,"I agree Tom, a few scotches always seemed to work for me better than T3's or almost anything else. Except perhaps something that they gave me when I shattered my ankle, that stuff was the cats"
223064,ccmtcanada,2008-07-04 12:51:00,7971,"Hey TJSA....I'm sure that would have worked too!!  Problem is that I don't drink...and somehow, I don't think 3 cokes would have taken the edge off....LOL."
223155,douG,2008-07-04 14:46:00,2693,"Speedy recovery, Joe."
222255,Daplumma,2008-07-02 22:12:00,1961,I am going in tomorrow morning for surgery to fix trigger finger on my right ring finger.Anyone had it done?How quick was the recovery?I know what the doctors have said but would like to hear from people who have had the surgery. Joe
222264,misfish,2008-07-02 22:26:00,29133,"Joe best of luck with the surgery. If you like,I can come down and pull the trigger for ya. Speedy recovery bud."
222268,holdfast,2008-07-02 22:34:00,1813,"UH, Thats Gay (LOL ) oops I mean UN -heterosexual        Sorry never had trigger finger surgery, but have a quick Recovery"
222269,ccmtcanada,2008-07-02 22:38:00,7971,"Good luck tomorrow!!!  I have instances, when my hands are cold mostly, where I'll straighten a finger, put a little tension on it and then it freezes in the open position.  It takes a lot of massaging to get it flexible again.  There is no popping sound when it goes back.  I suppose I should go get that looked at.  Problem is it happens maybe once a month.  Hope you have a speedy recovery!!!"
222273,Greencoachdog,2008-07-02 22:45:00,8163,What the heck!!!  Why wasn't I told aboot this up on the West Arm??? I coulda fixed it for you up there... out in the boat even!  Hope all goes well and you get back to finger banging in record time!   ... can't be any worse than the knee surgery stuff.
222291,Sandbag,2008-07-02 23:17:00,533,"Yes I had the surgey Daplumma.  I was in/out of the surgery in les than 15 minutes.  the longest part of the whole thing is waiting for the freezing to take.  Recovery was fairly short too as I recall.  Keep you finger rested in the splint that they will put it in and you should be back to normal in a week or two.  It will feel much better before that, but back to new in two weeks.  Cheers and let us know how it goes  Craig"
222313,Photoz,2008-07-03 00:06:00,792,"I had 'TRIGGER THUMB' fixed almost 20 years ago . . .    it had become quite bothersome & painful, to the point it was giving me trouble holding & sorting mail. I'd never been in a hospital before, and I considered it MAJOR surgery!! Watta a big chicken-crap I was . . .    it took 15 minutes to freeze it, perhaps another 15 to 'fix' it, an hour to sit in the 'recovery room,' and I went home with 2 stitches. It throbbed a bit for about a half day . . .     I had a splint on it for a week, took it easy for another week, and that was it. At the time the doctor said it should do me for at least 15 years before I MIGHT get any recurrance . . .    it's been 20 & counting."
222323,Nanook,2008-07-03 00:20:00,565,"All the best with the OP.  Joe !!  Bet ya glad it's not the middle finger, ya'll would be flipping 'birds' at everybody !"
222342,Bassledgen,2008-07-03 00:41:00,3,"My best advice is to mark which finger your getting operated on and make sure its the right one. I got my knee operated on last year and didnt mark it and they did the wrong knee. Theres nothing like waking up with the Dr telling me he operated on the wrong knee. So he did both. Now Im looking for a good lawyer. Thats my only advice, mark the finger well."
222344,Joey,2008-07-03 00:44:00,9122,"Wow, you do that much shooting Joe?  Good luck with the surgery.  Keep us updated on how it went.  Joey"
222353,Greencoachdog,2008-07-03 00:58:00,8163,  Yeah!  Take the red ribbon from around the goats neck and tie it around your finger!!!
222361,Daplumma,2008-07-03 01:08:00,1961,Thanx for the well wishes and replies.I have had 3 Cortizone shots in the finger in the last year and a half but it is a very temporary fix.If I make a fist I have to pull the finger straight and it makes a popping noise and hurts like h*ll.Down here they write where they are going to operate on the patient with a magic marker.I'll let y'all know how it turns out. Joe
222371,PERCHER,2008-07-03 01:14:00,787,I had the same operation on my right thumb about 6 years ago.It was quick and quite painless.The whole thing took about 20 minutes or so.The part I hated was the shot of quartazone the doctor gave me to tied me over until my operation.Now that hurt.Have no fear it will be all over before you know it and in about two weeks you will be good to go. Dan
222374,Mike the Pike,2008-07-03 01:16:00,3421, Pretty soon you will have to redo the throttle fingers for the Bike not sure about the boat though as we don't see any fish pics from you anymore
222395,PERCHER,2008-07-03 01:43:00,787,We will have to let Quinte prove you wrong.
222406,Whopper,2008-07-03 01:52:00,2174,Good Luck Joe!
222416,huntervasili,2008-07-03 02:10:00,1604,Hope to see you get in and out of there quick... My grandfather had the surgery and said it was quick and helped him a heck of alot.
222437,oxcowboy,2008-07-03 03:00:00,544,"dont know anything about the surgery, but best of luck and hope ya have a speedy recovery.  jason"
222498,motv8tr,2008-07-03 09:42:00,2587,"Good luck today Joe, hope you have lots of wine kicking around for your recovery  Maureen"
222499,Rich Clemens,2008-07-03 09:52:00,3131,Good luck today Joe.
222511,aplumma,2008-07-03 11:11:00,6896,Well Joe heads in this mornin for the operation with Becky driving so I know it will be done right. I will post after he gets home to tell you if he is still high and giggling like a school girl or just a bump on the log.   Good luck Joe.  Art
222520,Spiel,2008-07-03 11:29:00,9065, ....Yes please keep us posted Art. I'm guessing it won't affect his typing abilities.
222532,tjsa,2008-07-03 11:48:00,1578," Who knows Chris, it might improve it   :lol:  :lol:         Nah, wouldn't happen, couldn't happen. Could it????????????//...........time will tell.  Hope everything goes well Joe, and you are happily painting deer in the near future. I guess Becky is gonna be operating the paintball gun for the next few weeks?????"
222548,pikehunter,2008-07-03 12:13:00,1659,"Hope the surgery helps your trigger finger problem.  I have been told by my orthopedic doctor that  a cortisone injection in the finger is quite painful, at least that is what he told me when I went to see him about one for my 2 trigger fingers so I walked away to try and live with it. Somedays they are really bad, especially in the morning.  But you probably know this for fact after 3 shots!  Best of luck Joe."
222574,DANIMAL,2008-07-03 13:00:00,215,"Is trigger finger another name for Dupuytrens disease? I have had the lump on my hand for about 3 years now, I'm just wondering how long it usually takes for the hand to start curling up.  good luck with your sugery."
