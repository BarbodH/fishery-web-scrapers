All of these people stepped up to the plate to help us with our June get together no questions asked and were very generous. Reciprocity is a good thing! Some of us already buy these products or subscribe to their services. It'd be very nice to, when shopping for products or services, consider the list of people who contributed to OUR cause when the time came.  Thanks again everyone."

221068,douG,2008-06-29 19:48:00,2693,"Thanks 'specially to the Melancons aka The Plummas.  Their very generous donations were underscored by the distance they traveled to join us for our company, and by the fact that they were not promoting their businesses in the least.  These guys are true gentlemen, even if they talk funny.  Hats off to Joe and Art.  Hope to see y'all again next year."
