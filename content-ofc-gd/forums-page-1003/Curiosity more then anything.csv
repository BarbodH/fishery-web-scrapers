223269,tjsa,2008-07-04 18:24:00,1578,"Good Morning all  So im not going to go into detail but i will leave a link if you want to know more  1) how many people have a fixed marine VHF radio on their boat Answer, not me, 12 ft. tinny, and 2 canoes  2) do you have dsc capability Answer, NOT  3) do you have a distress button Answer, NO  4) for those that have a Vhf Radio with DSC /Distress do you have your radio tied into a GPS/Chartplotter Answer, see above.  5) last but not least do you have an MMSI # Answer, what does MMSI# mean???   Up here in the great northwest, get out of town 30 minutes, and you basically lose all communication with the city except in specific corridors on the Trans Canada Hwy. GPS's work just fine, but not cell phones or any marine VHF radio's inland. Out of the marina on Superior, not much of a problem.  Unless you are on fleetnet with the OPP, or own a satellite phone, you are on your own, always have been, and probably for my lifetime always will be.  We always let at least 2 other people know where we are headed, and when we ""EXPECT"" to return. That can change dramatically when out hunting(got home at midnight one time, after downing a moose 5 minutes before legal time ended, and had to dress it out in the dark with disposable flashlights, that was fun). It's usually not an issue when fishing though. Wherever we go, we always come across other anglers, bush workers, mining prospectors, etc. etc. .............and if we would  be in some distress be it physically, or vehicle problems, someone almost always comes by within 30 minutes.  Or, we just start walking toward civilization(been there, done that)."
223277,BITEME,2008-07-04 18:42:00,1969,   MMSI....Maritime Mobile Service Identities (MMSIs) assigned to Canadian vessels and coast stations by Industry Canada
223289,maybe,2008-07-04 19:33:00,307,"It's a great idea for a lot of people, but I don't think Jeff & I will be investing.  We're on small lakes, and within easy sight of houses ~95% of the time.  There's cell coverage where we are, and there's always 2 or 3 cell phones on board.  At least 1 of the phones stays in a floating waterproof bag, and has gps location enabled."
223301,fishindevil,2008-07-04 19:43:00,6254,"My fixed marine radio has that option as its new but i do not have a plotter,or radar,but i do have a distress button,and i have gps as well,so im not worried about having it signed up,as its too complicated,but its good for boaters who travel long distances on the great lakes,or even ocean travel,im only out salmon fishing and like the other member said i fish all over so its only good where its availiable,not in all the inland lakes areas up n orth..great safetyoption though !!!!"
223307,Greencoachdog,2008-07-04 19:50:00,8163,Never out of sight of land on our lakes and there's no shipping traffic on the Coosa River chain of lakes. Cell phone coverage and a cell phone onboard.
223345,LeXXington,2008-07-04 20:54:00,1928,"Safety in numbers  hardly ever go out on the big lakes when no one else is out..  Have GPS, VHF, lifejackets etc..  Always good advice, way too many people are getting killed one boats needlessly"
223356,Landlocked,2008-07-04 21:02:00,171,  Literally just got all of the above up and running on the weekend including inputing the MMSI...I play on Lake Erie with young kids and figure it's a small price to pay for the benefit it provides.
223385,tjsa,2008-07-04 21:43:00,1578,"Good for you Landlocked, if its available to you, why not use it!!!!!!!!!"
223389,FinS,2008-07-04 21:51:00,463,im in the market but just for vhf since i have the gps if you can find me a good used one that will be great pm's welcomed  sorry for the lil hijack  and happy fishing
