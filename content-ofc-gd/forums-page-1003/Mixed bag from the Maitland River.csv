My inlaws have a sailboat in one of the marinas up there and had invited us up for a visit.  About 30 seconds after my father in law and I setting up our fishing rods, my little sister in law starts hollering on the dock about having something huge on.  I look over and there she is with her little rod just about bent in two, cranking on the handle of her old push button reel and not making any headway.  The fish was too heavy for the drag so like a pro she grabs the rod and line and heaves a monster up onto the dock!  She looked just like the pros do on tv.  15 ft from shore with a dew worm and she nails a 3 lb largemouth!  My father in law and I are left standing there in disbelief.    Well now we were both on a mission!  A few docks further down I save my pride and not to be outdone by an 11 y/o girl I bag a nice 5 lb northern.  One of the better fights I've had with a fish in quite some time!    I then decided to see what was to be had in the ""Mighty Maitland"" and off I went.  A short while later I returned with this beauty, a 3 lb smallmouth.  Another great fight and the dinner menu was filled!    Alas, my poor father in law was not able to rid himself of the skunk and lost another $3 ($1 for the first, $1 for the most, and $1 for the biggest).  I think he's down about $6 now!  It was a great outing and a good time.  It was great to see Jenni nail the biggest fish she's caught to date.  I think she'll quickly tire of the little panfish she's used to now though.  PB"
