223252,Anatz,2008-07-04 17:39:00,74,"I've noticed that some Asian supermarkets sell walleye...is it illegal? It makes me wonder why people take fish home, maybe to sell it for profit? Can anyone explain if its illegal or legal to sell fish you catch."
223257,ccmtcanada,2008-07-04 17:46:00,7971,"From the regulations....page 8  GENERAL PROHIBITIONS – IT IS ILLEGAL TO:  • Fish for or possess the following specially protected fish species; American eel, cutlip minnow and redside dace.  • Possess any of the following live invasive species: rudd, ruffe, bighead carp, black carp, grass carp, silver carp, round goby, tubenose goby or any member of the snakehead family.  • Sell any angler-caught fish, crayfish, leeches, frogs, fish eggs or spawn, including angler-caught yellow perch taken from the waters of Lake St. Francis.

223267,huntervasili,2008-07-04 18:21:00,1604,"Yup, unless you have a licence to sell it it is 100% illegal to sell any harvested game or fish"
223271,ozaibak1,2008-07-04 18:32:00,401," Some people take their fish home to... EAT. Interesting on the illegality of selling it though, suspected it but never knew."
223272,wuchikubo,2008-07-04 18:34:00,1114,"CCMT said it.  Just keep in mind that there are commercial fisheries around that allow for fish to be sold including some we deem as sport fish. E.g. Largemouth bass (from the states' farms), northern pike (from ontario from Legal commercial fishing), crappie, sunfish, etc. Actually, I had questioned one place (an asian market) and the OMNR dispatched a CO over there to check it out and the CO phoned me back saying they had all the necessary permits, licenses and papers proving where they were from and clarified to me that there are sportfish that are also commercially taken for the marketplace. The walleye usually from lake Erie as I have been told."
223281,Zamboni,2008-07-04 18:57:00,235, Thinking you better give your mom back the sunfish money?  
223299,maybe,2008-07-04 19:42:00,307," Pretty sure I saw frozen ""pickeral"" for sale at one of the local Sobey's last year.  Don't really remember what the packaging looked like, other than it didn't strike me as someone using Saran Wrap at home.  Doubt a chain that big would be buying from a hobby angler.  Maybe the Asian places you were in buy from the same big supplier?  BTW, any recommendation for a really interesting market?"
223302,fishing,2008-07-04 19:46:00,167,Millions of fish were commercially caught and sold each year. http://www.glfc.org/pressrel/pr080318.pdf

223398,Woodsman,2008-07-04 22:15:00,1286, These would have been from Manitoba. My local Sobey's also carry these.
223404,Greencoachdog,2008-07-04 22:43:00,8163,You really should read the General Regulations Anatz... lots of good information in there.  ... as well as the regs for your zone!
223413,Whopper,2008-07-04 23:01:00,2174, Well said dawg!
223418,FinS,2008-07-04 23:11:00,463,any fish perhaps from junk fish to the elusive trout (that means any fish)  no fish is for sale unless u have a proper license just like eveyone else states it
223427,Cudz,2008-07-04 23:42:00,2652,"I know that there is several commercial fishermen on Georgian bay that net walleye and seel them to stores, local markets.  They are well within their rights as they have the appropriate licences.  There are also several native fisherman who use nets around that area as well and they may be allowed to sell as well."
