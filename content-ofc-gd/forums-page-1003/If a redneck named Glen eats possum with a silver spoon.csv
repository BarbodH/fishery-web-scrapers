222737,Roy,2008-07-03 18:11:00,13728,Are we talking about a cast spoon here?
222739,Joey,2008-07-03 18:14:00,9122,"No, silver spoon and paper plate"
222740,Reef Runner,2008-07-03 18:17:00,981,"I'd say ""what's the occasion? Spoons? Why in the heck would yall want to use musical instruments as cutlery.  That's just crazy talk that is.""  Sorry dawg, couldn't resist"
222741,Spiel,2008-07-03 18:17:00,9065,"....If Glen actually hits the possum himself is it still ""road kill"" or can he now just call it dinner?"
222745,Roy,2008-07-03 18:22:00,13728, In Alabama it's called self defense.
222747,Greencoachdog,2008-07-03 18:25:00,8163,The best thing about 'Possum innerds is... they is just as good the next day!!!
222748,Roy,2008-07-03 18:25:00,13728,In Arkansas it's called shopping.
222749,Joey,2008-07-03 18:27:00,9122," Okay, gotta clean the keyboard now"
222754,irishfield,2008-07-03 18:34:00,26272,I think it's a redneck  D      E       L   L     A    K     A      S   E    E   any way you slice if Hun !
222756,John,2008-07-03 18:43:00,2956,"Did he obtain the possum trollin' or castin'.......b'coss, if it was caught trollin' then................"
222759,maybe,2008-07-03 18:51:00,307,"...then I gotta ask:  1)  is snagging legal, or do you have to hook the possum in the mouth?  2)  what's the preferred trolling speed?  3)  if you accidentally catch an out of season Chevy, are you allowed to take its picture?"
222761,BITEME,2008-07-03 18:59:00,1969,4) will they hit marshmellows
222769,John,2008-07-03 19:10:00,2956,Didn't know you had to refrigerate them Glen..  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wxr0QqIT2sI
222770,Bly,2008-07-03 19:11:00,1556,"5)  Can they be netted and if so, what kind of net should one use?"
222771,ketchenany,2008-07-03 19:12:00,3229,5) not marshmellows; but something in a 14 or 15 inch rubber tire usually does the trick
222774,Headhunter,2008-07-03 19:24:00,5703,What if the driver was pulling a tiller! Argg! HH
222779,fishnsled,2008-07-03 19:36:00,3520,  Not sure but the rumour is they have a great set of teeth because of all the flossing going on.
222818,HTHM,2008-07-03 21:14:00,4082,Wouldn't you have to take the treble of the end of the spoon first? I could see the spoon gettin stuck in his craw otherwise....
222828,aplumma,2008-07-03 21:32:00,6896,Actually it usually the differential that kills them. When the car passes over them they jump up to change direction and the rear differential gets em.   Art
222831,Greencoachdog,2008-07-03 21:38:00,8163,  The Gerber Fishermans Tool is just as handy fer unhookin' 'Possums as it is for fish!!!  Possum fishin' reminds me of Halloween (when they bite the best) when we gather around and watch the young'uns bob for Armadillos in a #3 wash tub!
222905,Whopper,2008-07-04 00:50:00,2174,   Good one Joey! .....best NF thread I've read in awhile
