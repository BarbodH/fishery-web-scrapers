222334,nancur373,2008-07-03 00:34:00,1211,Went to the ponds at Stanley Park trailer park here in Erin for an hour after work. never fished there before. Caught 2 small bass here's one. The bait is almost bigger than the ambitious little guy.    There were a lot of these here too. Are they a type of sunfish or are they their own species? Real nice colors.   After yesterday @ Scugog and today here I think I just fell in love with bass fishin.

222435,holdfast,2008-07-03 02:54:00,1813," Hey Dawg I got a question for Ya.  I used to catch tons of these in Lake Champlain Vt growing up in the summers there.  My buddies at the time Vermonters, Connecticuters used to call them   JohnyTails, and Johnyroaches I believe. American terms I would say.  Have you ever heard of these names or others for Pumpkinseeds?"
222442,Burning Babies,2008-07-03 03:02:00,150,"I've never heard them called anything but pumpkinseeds.  Of course, there are a ton of regional names for fish as well, but I've never heard that one (neither has Google it seems).  If you've got the name right, it's very colloquial."
222482,holdfast,2008-07-03 04:31:00,1813,I always thought it had something to do with the tail because on a sunny day the tail has a very pronounced green spot hence the     tail have no Idea about the Johnny though
222879,Rich,2008-07-03 23:15:00,3927,"We call them ""treats"" down here.. but that's an inside joke. lol"
