Did a BSc in Bio but then went to work in the auto industry for 6 years, first in operations, then sales and marketing.  After two years of very intense work travel, I realized I'd never be able to fish nearly enough if I was on the road this much.  And so back to business school I went, with my wife looking after our expenses this year.  Gotta get my act together now though and find a job as I will be done in August.  Great thread - such a diverse background for everyone with lots of interesting experiences.  Fishing truly brings people together!"

I'm sure there are some parts that are less technology based than others, but the Refrigeration trade today , including Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning are very technical in nature. Building Automation and Controls are very computer based. The whole ""Green"" concept is reverting a lot of our work back to science and things like photovoltaic, wind energy, etc.  I don't think you meant it like this, but I always get a little peeved when someone says, ""if you don't want to stay in school, get a trade!""

We build those too. Restaurant? Yup. How about an entire new manufacturing plant? We'll build it, but can't guarantee your future success. That's up to you.  Bottom line is that in no way are trades dependent on the manufacturing industry. We build the entire nation from back yard sheds to automotive plants, nuclear power plants, and paper and sawmills. Tradesmen/women will never run out of work. In fact, it's difficult to keep up at times. Get a union trade and live a good life. Work until you're 55 and relax with a nice 60 to 80 g pension.

I didn't catch who he was, but he said that Ontario will be short 100,000 tradesmen by 2016. 80,000 short by 2012. Most of us tradesmen are baby boomers and will be retiring soon. Some have already started. That's going to open up a ton of jobs. So, if you don't mind working hard, getting dirty and being rewarded for your hard work, then perhaps a trade is for you.

215210,jace,2008-06-13 17:56:00,472,"  They've been predicting this for quite a few years now and i think it's finally starting to kick into gear.  Starting back in the early 80's, almost everybody and their dog was sent to university to the point where it was expected that school did not end at grade 12/13 and you would go to post secondary.   The prediction was that all the skilled tradesmen would become very scarce in the glut of university grads and it's happening.   Although the trade incomes willl never pass the top level accredited professionals, they're definitely getting paid more than the typical university grad.  4 of my friends' sons (different families) went to college for marine welding not long ago.  They graduated from 3-5 years ago and they're all pulling in over $100K.  not bad for people in their early 20's.   I went to university, got my CA, did that at a hometown firm for 7 years and didn't like it.  I later found myself in IT, worked for canada trust then  BMO in performance testing and systems migration and deployment.  That was interesting work but i didn't get enough free time during the summers so i moved on again to an industrial coatings company where i've been the last 5.  I don't find the place particularly stimulating because it's the same ol' same ol' every day but they allow me to take off for exntended trips whenever i want.  The joke is i'm the teacher there because i only work between 9-10 months/year.    I've been going up to Alaska every year for fishing about the last 15 years.  When i started going, it was about 3 times/year and i tried out all the seasons.  Man, some places up there get a lot of snow.  I've cut back a bit the last few years to make it one mega trip for  5-8weeks and fish everything there is to fish in that time.  I've made a lot of good friends up there over the years and a surprisingly huge numbers of people make the annual trip so i see  a different bunch of familiar faces every time.  Fishing has become part of my life and work and i basically won't make a career move unless it allows me to plan out good fishing trips.   Do what you like and like what you do.  There's no point otherwise, life is too short to spend it being a clock-watcher, hammering away at a job you hate."

Then, moved on to other BIGGER PC companies and then off to a smaller VAR (value added reseller).  I was at the VAR for 5 years before I decided to move on.  The VAR I was at was good pay but it was a small place so I learned a lot about the folks I worked with that I never needed to know.  Trust me, things I NEVER wanted to know…  So off to Dell I went for 2 year (2 years at Dell = 4+ years in any other sales job).  In my 2 years there I did large corporate sales (CBG/LCA for any ex Dell folk out there) for software and printing and imaging consultant.  Now, I do corporate sales (for Print only) at another company and I enjoy my challenges.  After all, not many people think a TV and cell phone company make business class printers so it’s a hard fight to win business and mindshare.  But the finical rewards are there so I cannot complain too much.  Besides, I am an outside sales Account Executive with them so I do work out of the office and that allows me to have some days at home for lunch with the wife and kids… Not everyone needs a degree to have a great paying job, that I can attest to.  Having an education is great as long as the one you spent so many years working on is the one field you want to be in.

Went out to Jasper Albeta for a summer (three months).  Got a job as a bartender/server.  Decided not to go back to school and went to Australia instead for 6 months.  Worked there as a bartender.  I then proceeded to go back out to Jasper.  Again as a bartender.  Then I moved on to Vancouver as a bike rental dude.  That lasted 3 months.  Ended up back in Jasper.  This time as a bike mechanic.  Also did some bartending on the side.  I then got into being a white water raft guide.  Moving into management positions with all three jobs.  Man I worked a lot.  Fastforward to here in Brockville.  My van broke and I had to get a job to fix it.  Spent a winter here in a sports store.  In the spring I moved back out to, you got it, Jasper.  When the summer was over I headed back east to a job in the sports store again.  I then got the oportunity to manage a new bike shop in town.  After a year and a half, I bought the business.  Going on my third year now.   For the most part I love it.  Although this spring has been very draining on me as it is really busy.  A great problem to have, I am in no way complaining.  I never did finish school.  I will never be rich.  But I have lived one heck of a life.  I have some regrets about not getting the ""suit"" job, because of the financial stability.

214734,Gerritt,2008-06-12 20:45:00,6129,"I am 32 and manage a custom high end home builder.. I went to UWO, Com.Sci.  it was pounded in my head from a young age to work smart, not hard.. (this from a construction family) I worked in several IT jobs.. my last one being Network Admin for Globalserv Communications..(Now Primus)  Anyways... I got back into construction of and on back and forth (I started at the tender age of 5 holding ladders etc)... and finally figured out that I loved it..  I spent 3 and a half years under probably one of the toughest, most demanding carpenters you would ever meet.. Perfection was NOT good enough.. He was a English wooden ship builder and cabinet maker.. this guy was tough on me.. But I thank him every day for it!..  Then I shattered my wrist....  Just so turns out that Headhunter here on the board, had a friend that needed someone with my skills... it is not everyday you meet a carpenter with computer skills or visa versa.. we were a perfect match..  I am now his right hand man, have crews under me and life is looking up!  all in all I am still involved in doing what I love, without the blood sweat and tears!  G"

214752,steve_paul,2008-06-12 21:20:00,658,"Ok seriously, not really a thong model.  Thankfully for all who have eyesight.  I manage a Residential Heating and Cooling company here in St. Thomas.  Work for good people, job is enjoyable, meet lots of interesting people.  However, if I had a choice, I would love to be in the same industry just further east (Kingston - Perth area) or further up north (Sudbury - North Bay area).  Like what I am doing just don't like living in this area.  (cough cough - Tinman, know of any openings up your way   )"
