Anyone know anything about those geothermal heat pumps? I'm wondering installation costs?  I'm curious where this out of control trainwreck of our economy is heading?  Bushart

223326,GBW,2008-07-04 20:17:00,8460,It is a great way as the money you save after a few years pays for itself and then some.  I do not have it yet but will be looking in to this more when I move in to my new house.  I know people getting it done right now and the cost depends on how and where you have to dig.  the how is - straight down or go on a 45* and then the where is just where?
