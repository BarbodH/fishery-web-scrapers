222881,Slayingm,2008-07-03 23:21:00,204,"Managed to hit the Haliburton's over the long weekend for a few days and got into some nice smallie action on a variety of lakes.  I concentrated on working rock shoals, island points, rock/sand and rock/weed transistions in 5 to 15' of water and the smallies were there!  Tubes in dark (smoke, dark green and black) worked well (1/8 and 3/16 oz heads) as did Storm wiggle warts and jerkbaits in shad and firetiger patterns.  Some fish (like this beauti) also came on a  5"" jigworm.   Man the fish are dark up north!!!    The water temps are really starting to rise now and will start to move some of the bigger fish into deeper water where drop-shotting and draggin heavy tubes will be required in the up coming weeks so get out and enjoy some of the shallow water action now!  Remember to be safe out there..... Greg."
