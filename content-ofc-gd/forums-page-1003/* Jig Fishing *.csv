215786,Clampet,2008-06-15 20:41:00,1947,Just curious as to how many board members drag jigs tipped with crawlers fer Walleye across sandy flats. I found that some lakes have weed growth over the sand flats I used to fish 15 years ago.
215810,Sinker,2008-06-15 21:48:00,8692,"Thats pretty much all I ever do. Only, no worms. Just grubs. Mostly off deep weed edges, but this time of year you can drift the weed flats pretty good before the weeds get too thick.  Sinker"
215815,Mike01,2008-06-15 22:00:00,378,"Do this all the time on Nipissing, either drifting or slow trolling.  Worms, leeches, grubs..whatever the fish want!"
215913,BabyHerc,2008-06-16 01:45:00,285,"When the wind is up and out of the west I like drifting sand flats, weed flats, points and channels.  Weedless jigheads tipped with the bait du jour, spinner rigs, carolina rigs, drop shot rigs, I drift 'em all."
216035,jwl,2008-06-16 13:28:00,1056,"I do that alot at my camp as well, works great when there is a slight breeze to drift along in the boat...I use the chartreuusse Gulp worm for this or 6 inch white twisters"
222927,mattmacewan,2008-07-04 01:48:00,18,I've done LOADS of this up on the North Shore Nipissing....No real structure to speak of and it works well given how the boat can move so quick and there isnt alot to anchor on.  I find the jigging works nice but I prefer the bottom bouncer with a harness as long as the current is strong enough to push the boat at a decent speed.  I dunno if it's a more consistent presentation when you're drifting or what...
222936,FinS,2008-07-04 02:07:00,463,the best way and dont forget to try harnesses the same way
222949,tbayboy,2008-07-04 02:38:00,1497,Same here - dragging a lindy rig or a bouncer or a jig all tipped with the flavour de'jour over the sand always worked.
222950,modny,2008-07-04 02:42:00,502,"i've had really good experiences drifting white 8th oz grubs over flats tipped with a crawler. especially past points,through narrows etc  i usually cast her ouf real far first to make sure she gets down there too"
222952,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-04 02:45:00,2585,i do this alot as well!  I find if i hit the weed edges and catch a good drift i can get 3 or 4 fish every pass.  Its way easier if you have a trolling motor ot keep you on the edge of the weeds but sometimes you get lucky and the wind blows you the right way.  Cheers!
