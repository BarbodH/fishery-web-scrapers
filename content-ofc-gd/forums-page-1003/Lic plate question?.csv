222179,tinbanger,2008-07-02 17:45:00,1028,Friend of mine bought a new trailer from a company in US . He has only a bill of sale ( company name) and they delivered it for him to his cottage in Ontario  He is having difficulty getting plates MTO is looking for ownership or documents from florida stating the trailer has never been registered .Neither of which he can get . Because the bill of sale is in a compnay name the local MTO won't allow him to register it with the bill of sale only?  I suggested he call it ' homemade' and get it regsitered that way .This worked on an older trailer I got with a boat that had no regsitration documnets and the id plate was too worn to read .The local MTO suggested this as a solution.  Anyone have any better ideas? He is only planning the use the trailer twice a year ( in and out)   TB
222211,spooner_jr,2008-07-02 19:20:00,193,The dealer he bought it from should give him a title for the trailer.  Did he buy it in a company name and is trying to register it in his own name?  You may find the link below helpful.  http://boating.ncf.ca/buy-usa.html
222257,forrest,2008-07-02 22:13:00,1032,"the above link is correct and has great info:  Does the trailer have a VIN on it?  - If a notary states that it is homemade: RIV inspection $200, bill of sale not required....he may get burned this way if someone aside from the notary wants to see it (like the RIV inspection guy).  avoid fines and possible confiscation:  - If the bill of sale is not dated it is better.  Get a letter from manufacturer stating there are no recalls on the trailer. -contact customs, they will require a bill of sale and official statement of origin/title, not all states have these so you have to see what the rules are for florida -you do not have to go to a border crossing.  Explain that you do not have a temp license and cannot get one. They may come by your house or ask for pictures. -do not fib about purchase price or anything else....they often find out and will not be happy. -pay them the GST and get the importation stamped.  Have them to the RIV stuff and pay them $200 OR for a slightly faster response they fill out hte RIV form and you go to riv.ca, fax it and pay online. -You are now done with customs.  MTO: -MTO have a large percentage of unskilled and uneducated people answering the phones so do not go by what they say.  Phone 5 different times and get 5 different answers...they will all be wrong.  -wait for your RIV 'f2' form to arrive.....go to MTO and get your temp license, don't delay you are on a clock.  Go on a weekday (trust me) -You should now have your 'f1' (from customs)which in combination with the title and bill of sale can be used to get a temp license.....if the bill of sale is old you may not get your temp license and will have to risk the drive to canadian tire for your final RIV inspection. -get your RIV form approved at Canadian Tire and then return to MTO for your plate, pay pst.  Go on a weekday (trust me)  read the web site too.  Good Luck"
