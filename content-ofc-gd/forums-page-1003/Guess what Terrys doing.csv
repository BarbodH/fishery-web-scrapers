221792,jediangler,2008-07-01 16:40:00,1923,Looks like he's unwrapping his line from the trolling motor. And then he's gonna sit on his sandwich. What did I win?
221795,misfish,2008-07-01 16:43:00,29133, LOL I was going to eat the sandwich while his back was turned.

221842,Tacklebuster,2008-07-01 19:15:00,303,"Hi Terry,  We were in Cooks yesterday, it was slow to say the least and lots of dead carp, which was a bit nasty.  Which brings up my question, it looks like you were on the N. Shore, were there any dead carp on that side of the lake.  Do you think that all dead carp might have an effect on the bass and pike fishing?"
221844,Terry,2008-07-01 19:19:00,14456,"no  dead carp up where we were but I here there are at pefferlaw, so it will be the whole lake soon  and yes I do think the rotting carp will slow the fishing down or maybe it will push the fish out deeper, as carp do seem to hang out in the deeper water.... another week and they are going to stink so bad, I don't think I will want to fish near them"
221848,medmart,2008-07-01 19:23:00,587,Nice fish Brian here i thought terry was going to fall in the water you could have gave him a push lol  Rob
