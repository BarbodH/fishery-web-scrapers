I may have an hour or two spare time and probably won't be boating it.  Any info is appreciated. Thanks Jeff"

223347,Fang,2008-07-04 20:54:00,1330,Was down on the east side for the fireworks July 1st and walked the breakwall and inner harbor around the marina. Did notice a few small panfish along the walls.  They put a temporary dock out in front of the willows this week. Not sure if it will stick around but it's definitley in the way for fishing.
