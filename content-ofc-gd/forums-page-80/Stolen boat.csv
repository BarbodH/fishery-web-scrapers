1014279,gaspumper,2017-09-26 11:52:00,393,"Hello everyone; I am posting this here in the hopes that someone will see this and inform the OPP. I don't hold out much hope, but I need to try.This past weekend, the Kawartha Chapter of Muskies Canada was holding our annual fundraiser get together on the Tri Lakes of Pigeon, Chemong and Buckhorn. Sometime through the night early morning Saturday, a boat was stolen off the docks at Scotsmen Point Resort. This boat did not belong to one of the MCI participants but it was owned by an American and his fishing buddy from Ohio who had just arrived to spend 17 days fishing for Muskies. The keys were not in the ignition, but rods, reels etc. were on board. Ohio registration numbers on the side. The boat is a Starweld http://www.starcraftstarweld.com/ (made by StarCraft) 18 Pro with a 125 Yamaha four stroke on the back. It was only four months old. The owner was heartbroken so our group invited them both to dinner as our guests and we took up a collection of one Muskie bait from each MCI member to help them get back on their feet. A rough estimate of $600.00 in baits was placed on a table and a brand new Handlebarz Muskie bump board as well. If you see this boat please contact the OPP."

1014288,fishindevil,2017-09-26 14:19:00,6254,I seen that on facebook early this morning....man that sucks for sure......I hope they find it
1014295,captpierre,2017-09-26 14:54:00,2521,Welcome to Canada Good on you guys to help out.
1014297,leaf4,2017-09-26 15:12:00,2466,"That's brutal. Hopefully there's a good outcome. That's one way to ruin a trip, and an image of the country/area"
1014303,JoePa,2017-09-26 16:24:00,179,Boy that is terrible - that's why I chain my boat to an object that can't be moved whenever I fish somewhere in Ontario - sure they can cut the chain with a cutter but it will take a lot more work and can be caught - also my boat is an old one so it isn't something that stands out -  One thing down here if you catch someone stealing your boat or things from the boat you can beat the crap out of the guy - up there you probably get into trouble = it is a shame but you have to assume that there are crooks all over the place and live with this in mind - hope the guy had his boat insured otherwise he is out some big bucks
1014307,Whitespinnerbait,2017-09-26 16:39:00,2038,Sounds like someone from the Muskies Chapter stole it....
1014325,misfish,2017-09-26 22:24:00,29133,"When I clicked on the pic of the boat, I was WOW, sweet ride. Then I got upset about the theft. Unreal.     One thing down here if you catch someone stealing your boat or things from the boat you can beat the crap out of the guy - up there you probably get into trouble = it is a shame but you have to assume that there are crooks all over the place and live with this in mind - hope the guy had his boat insured otherwise he is out some big bucks   Right on joePa, and you are correct. We have pussy laws up here."
1014327,woodenboater,2017-09-26 22:32:00,2277,"That's brutal and pretty bold to steal it from the dock. Wonder if there's any type of Lo-Jack product for boats ? hide it somewhere with a separate power source maybe.  Hope it's found intact, I've never seen Starwelds up here so it should turn heads."
1014328,Rizzo,2017-09-26 22:45:00,4754,"I trust nobody. Lures, rods, net, fishfinder even trolling motor all get locked up in the cottage or truck if I overnight somewhere. That truly sucks....hope these guys somehow make a vacation out of this still"
1014360,jimmer,2017-09-27 18:30:00,2730,I wonder if they are a member on here. There are some that report on their muskie trips to the kawarthas.

Cops said he must have fallen down when running"

1015009,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-08 05:19:00,8243,Unbelievable. I didn't know crackheads like boating. What also is unbelievable the boat was found. This social media thing does have it's good points.  You did a good thing Tom. Kudos to you.
