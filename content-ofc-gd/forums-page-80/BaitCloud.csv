964862,captpierre,2016-04-02 00:20:00,2521,Just came from the Sportman Show at the Lindsay Fairgrounds. Nice little show. A bit of everything. Talked to a young guy in a booth Developed a product called BaitCloud. You drop a scented effervescent  ball in the water and it fizzes and releases a scent and bubbles from the lake bottom Supposed to attract fish. Originally developed for ice fishing. Comes in a three pack. $10 at the show. Bought the shad scent. Might work or be a gimmick. Anybody hear of this? BaitCloud.com
964868,chris.brock,2016-04-02 02:00:00,4053,"I don't even know what  effervescent means.  I would say gimmick, but for $10 give it a shot and let us know."
964869,captpierre,2016-04-02 02:02:00,2521,Sorta like Alka Seltzer
964872,manitoubass2,2016-04-02 02:32:00,11391,I could see it working possibly for perch
964875,GBW,2016-04-02 03:02:00,8460,I could see it working possibly for perch I'll get you some and send them up when I go tomorrow afternoon...
964878,manitoubass2,2016-04-02 03:19:00,11391,Heck im down!  Maybe try it on the crappie spots first
964886,Terry,2016-04-02 09:04:00,14456,so you can fish 3 spots for 10 bucks im too cheap
964889,Rizzo,2016-04-02 12:20:00,4754,giv'er a shot....for $10 its low risk. Many fish are inherently curious so I could see the ruckus this causes being effective. We bang things off bottom to attract different species so why not?
964915,grimsbylander,2016-04-02 16:44:00,3016,"They're a Canadian Sportfishing sponsor. I know, that's not helping..."
964949,GBW,2016-04-02 21:06:00,8460,I checked them out and was going to buy a tube as they did a demo in the big fish tank and they got all wound up but I spent more cash than expected so I passed...  Good beef jerky at the other end of the row too!!!  (yeah they stole the baitball guy's cash...sorry)
964955,kenzy31,2016-04-02 21:38:00,261,Don't plan on using a fish finder with that stuff! Buddy had a sample from the manufacturer this past ice season so we tried it where we were whitie fishing on Simcoe. Cluttered up my x67 so bad for an hour that I moved holes. We were in 40ish feet for reference

You want to do the same, just drop your bait to the bottom and bounce it . You will get a cloud and fish will come in."
964970,Lape0019,2016-04-03 00:29:00,647,Sounds similar to the crackle product people used to put in their tubes. I imagine it would cover a lot more water though. I still know people who swear by crackle.

964973,John Bacon,2016-04-03 00:42:00,3277,  LOL Try using eno. Same effect.LOL  Crackle works by creating sounds; not bubbles.   I think I heard of people using Alka Seltzer in their tubes though.

964975,manitoubass2,2016-04-03 00:54:00,11391,Well I was gonna try it on crappie/perch but geoff cheaped out and had to buy beef jerky???  (I woulda done the same)

964990,manitoubass2,2016-04-03 02:59:00,11391,Awesome!!!!
964992,bobowski,2016-04-03 03:31:00,360,"My buddy brought one up to nipissing a month ago. He said it was the secret weapon. lol. After dropping it down the hole 10 minutes later he caught the biggest Perch of the weekend. Coincidence? Maybe, but he was pretty pumped."
965237,super dave,2016-04-04 21:28:00,323,While ice fishing on Simcoe I had a nice school of perch in my area so decided to drop down a garlic bait cloud to keep them around.  I didn't get a single bite after and I couldn't even see if they were still around because my sonar was clouded from the bubbles.   I had to relocate about 20-30 feet away.   Further I got from the bait cloud the more fish there were.  But on another occasion I hit Pike consistanly while ice fishing using the same product.  I won't be using it again for perch but maybe will give it one more shot with Pike.
965273,David Chong,2016-04-05 00:45:00,836,It definitely can have applications for ice-fishing and stationary fishing like carp fishing. I'll have to use it a little more before passing judgement.

965597,dave524,2016-04-07 13:49:00,4508,"When I lived at Long Point years ago, the party boats that drifted the sandy bottomed Inner Bay for smallies would often drag a piece of chain to stir up the bottom to attract fish, not sure if it attracted minnows that in turn attracted the bass or it directly attracted the bass but much the same principle."
1014866,SaugaPikeSlayer,2017-10-05 22:12:00,48,"Dropped these last year. Fished for 45 mins at a marina, saw no fish. Dropped one of these and 7 smallies were hovering around the cloud column within a couple of minutes.  They work. I'm just not crazy about spending 10 bucks on them."
