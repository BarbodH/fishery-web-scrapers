I had a buddy in my boat and another friend was out with his buddy.  We were the only two boats on the water. Made a few quick cast off the launch, but decided it was best to scout out the lake's shoreline.  We identified one end of the lake as the best bet after trolling a little (caught one smallie trolling).  We ended up catching between 15 and 20 bass for the day. All the largemouth, but one were caught in the same location on wacky rigs.  The rest of the shoreline looked awesome, but just wouldn't produce.  I did catch 2 more smallies by trolling the open water, which I find successful at this time of the year. I know it's not the usual way to catch bass, but it works when you get tired of casting. All in all it was a fun day on the water."

On Lake Erie I would troll a small deep diving crankbait and have a marker ready to throw with a hookup, then tube or dropshot that area."
