1014422,porkpie,2017-09-28 16:40:00,2521,"It happens, I've had to hold more than one of my kids over the side for a dump.  My July trip to Nippising, the oldest boy had to use the bucket.  Of course I took a picture to show his eventual bride one day!"
1014423,AKRISONER,2017-09-28 16:59:00,5558,lmaoooo chris thats ruthless
1014426,Governator,2017-09-28 18:07:00,879,Always try to push one out before I hit any sort of main lake so I'm good for the day.  If I'm on a weekend fishing/camping trip just hit a shore.
1014428,fishing n autograph,2017-09-28 18:42:00,2540, Pregame dump! ?
1014429,Garnet,2017-09-28 18:51:00,2056,When I was tournament guy I new where every open crapper was between Oshawa and Bobcaygeon and down to Belleville. Ball diamonds where always good.  My fav story was a buddy that had the cramp just as they where started first row of docks in major tournament.  So he just crapped his pants and finished the docks then jump in and cleaned up.  The last week of August I was way down the Long Reach and got the cramp. Jump in but I'm always afraid of losing my boat so I did the knee deep aqua dump. Just back in boat and the kayaker comes around the point.  I just stayed on the trees so she went around don't think she seen paper.
1014430,chris.brock,2017-09-28 19:13:00,4053," I saw a buddy do a deep water, swimming aqua dump. It floated up quick. As he swam away he was creating a back eddy and it chased him for a while."

1014460,Woodsman,2017-09-29 02:16:00,1286,That is why i got a boat with a cuddy and a porta john!!! In the tin boat a bucket will do!!! If the fishing partner complains he gets dropped on shore! You do realize that it's technically illegal to have a porta potty on a boat in Ontario. Used or unused. Pump out toilets are the only legal ones. That being said I never heard of anyone actually being charged for having one on their boat in Ontario waters.
1014466,Acountdeleted,2017-09-29 11:38:00,2562,"We were trapped on a lake once in Ear Falls. (The day the tornado hit lac suel) so the girl I am working with has to go but we legit have no where. We are in a 14 ft boat in a marsh waiting for the lodge owner to come save us.  So we tie a rope to the front of the boat, pass it back to her so she can hang off the back without falling in. Quite the arm workout.  I remember after she showed me (with clothes on) the position she had to get in to make this work. I've never laughed so hard"
1014468,Fisherman,2017-09-29 12:26:00,7201,I remember after she showed me (with clothes on) the position she had to get in to make this work. I've never laughed so hard  Nature wasn't nice when it designed some of the female plumbling.

1014488,Old Ironmaker,2017-09-29 17:37:00,8243,"The question is ""Is it legal."" I asked a Cop this AM and the answer was no it isn't. Urinating or defecating in a public place is illegal, as well one may be charged with indecent exposure as well.  Having Diabetes I can tell you when ya gotta go ya gotta go. I will pull over and find a discrete area, out in the boonies that's easy in the city not so much. I know every washroom between here and Hamilton. If I can't get to one I find a dumpster behind a store is the most discrete spot. Car washes are good too. As for a 2pile, well that can be a challenge. Pretending to check wheel nuts works well as a camouflage.  If anyone tells you they haven't had an ""accident"" since they were a baby they either aren't old enough yet or are lying. Everywhere I go I have a change of underwear, socks, shoes, hand wipes and  toilet paper. Especially in the golf bag. Buddy lost his favorite golf towel once. I howled when he wondered how that towel fell off his bag!! In the boat I have a 1 bucket and 2pile bucket. Use your imagination."

1014541,FloatnFly,2017-09-30 12:12:00,1640,"Out in a lake is one thing, try a busy river or creek.......I've surprised more than one dog walker in the woods"
1014370,limeyangler,2017-09-28 01:33:00,5204,Just wondering.
1014371,fishing n autograph,2017-09-28 01:45:00,2540,"Well there's laws regarding indecent acts, but usually public urination is a bylaw charge. I'd suggest that you try be discreet and make sure you're alone before whipping your junk out."
1014372,Pikeslayer,2017-09-28 01:50:00,1443,No clue here as to legality. But I've often wondered how much human 'waste' is expelled during hard water season on heavily fished lakes? Like Simcoe??
1014374,Sinker,2017-09-28 02:15:00,8692,Dilution is the solution to pollution. Human waste is the least of our worries... legal or not.  S.
1014378,manitoubass2,2017-09-28 02:24:00,11391,"No way am I dropping a deuce in the lake, that's for shore lol.  As for pissing, I'll whip it out anywhere in nature, or my backyard. Just make sure nobody is around first"
1014379,SirCranksalot,2017-09-28 02:32:00,3291,Urine is quite sterile---turds and most definitely not! I do as MB2 does. Rain washes it into the soil.  If #2 is not illegal it should be!!
1014380,manitoubass2,2017-09-28 03:26:00,11391,Ah a turd won't hurt a lake.  I just won't crap outta my boat because I haven't figure out a way to do it without crapping ON my boat lol
1014381,limeyangler,2017-09-28 04:21:00,5204,"Lol, I have a confession to make, first time for everything I guess, but had to sit over the side of the boat tonight for a #2, was interesting watching the it go down on the fish finder. Ironically I was fishing for crappie."
1014382,limeyangler,2017-09-28 04:23:00,5204,One way to keep folks off your waypoints... lol.... fish fry anyone?

1014392,AKRISONER,2017-09-28 11:38:00,5558,"well ive got a funny story about this...i wish i could tell you guys in person but ill do my best to convey the hilarity over message board post.   A few years back when i first started getting into fishing two of my best friends who also happen to be brothers the cirillo brothers took me out bass fishing on the tri lakes.  So there we were in the gannon narrows when dave says, oh snap...i gotta drop an aqua dump. Now these guys have mastered the art of hanging off the back ladder and using the passing lake water as a bidet of sorts...to the extreme they will even use ipilot to get the boat moving to even get some flow.  noticing a boat about 50 yards to our port side, dave turns the boat so that our bow is facing the neighboring boat and then climbs onto the ladder on the stern and says ""hey scott jump on the trolling motor pedal and make sure the front of the boat stays facing those guys so they cant see me""  Here I am having never used a trolling motor in my life tasked with keeping the boat straight...and sure enough she starts to swing slightly...and sure enough me not knowing what the hell im doing puts the boat onto constant 4 with the head turned...the boat starts swinging quickly and dave starts screaming and sure enough theres dave ass out with a turd comin outta his rear end facing our neighbor and today hes dropping floaters...he finishes up as fast as possible, doesnt even warn me jumps in the boat fires up the engine and peels the hell outta there.  Its now known as the cirillo aqua dump...and any time it happens we yell ""Aqua Dump"" to the tone of aqua lung."
1014393,Cast-Away,2017-09-28 12:13:00,790,I'm sorry but if you are not on hard water why wouldn't you just go ashore? How would you feel as a nearby cottager and have that wash up?
1014394,Thrilla,2017-09-28 12:17:00,164,When you have to go... you have to go....

1014400,SirCranksalot,2017-09-28 13:19:00,3291,If you are on the ice wouldn't you let it freeze and then scoop it into a plastic bag?
1014401,jimmer,2017-09-28 13:41:00,2730,It's happens to most of us.  I've seen guys jump right in the lake and go for a swim and come back relieved. I remember being in a walleye tournament and my brother was going in a bucket when I hooked onto a 5 lber and was yelling at him to get the darn net. There he is netting the fish while in the act. other stories I just don't want to share! LOL
1014402,Fisherman,2017-09-28 13:53:00,7201,"I'm sure a couple of Hershey bars won't make that much difference, after all, how many of natures creatures dump in the lake. Geese, ducks, seagulls, beavers, rats.  And the biggest ones, ALL of the fish."
1014403,manitoubass2,2017-09-28 14:09:00,11391,"This might be the best/worst thread ever lol.  Yeah if I had a big boat and fished huge bodies of water I'd bring a bucket, then when I finished I'd rinse the bucket off in the lake lol.  Lol Simon, Terry and akri  I guess on these shield lakes we are lucky to islands nearby lol"
1014404,DanD,2017-09-28 14:12:00,2223,"There's more crap going into the Northern lakes then just the fishers dropping their loads; when out in the boat. There's one lodge that I stayed at, where when someone flushed the toilet; you could see the toilet paper surfacing about 25 feet off the end of the dock. The water intake was about 50 feet upstream of the dock. LOL  Dan."

Ice fishing a few years ago I got caught far from the cottage. I dropped a bomb in a big flower pot at a vacant cottage, hahahaha"
