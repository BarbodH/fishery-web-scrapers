1014223,Pikeslayer,2017-09-25 16:49:00,1443,Captured on 09/24 South of Mapleview on 400SB
1014225,Dutch01,2017-09-25 16:58:00,1431,There's a boat pointing the wrong way?
1014230,manitoubass2,2017-09-25 17:33:00,11391,What the drag???
1014240,cheaptackle,2017-09-25 20:26:00,849,Boat is not hooked up to my vehicle and following me?  Michael
1014242,Big Cliff,2017-09-25 21:22:00,6899,Beer can on the dash?
1014244,Fisherman,2017-09-25 21:42:00,7201,Why are you in the number 1 lane?
1014246,misfish,2017-09-25 21:57:00,29133,Is that a hands free device????  Boats looking for a new owner. One that will keep it north of 89. LOL
1014248,Pikeslayer,2017-09-25 22:46:00,1443,Real curious how it ended up that way???? SUV south of it did not have a hitch.  LOL. That's a 407 transponder & M was driving. I'm in the MV1 directly in front.  Passing slower moving traffic per the HTA   Dash cam wise guy
1014249,misfish,2017-09-25 22:48:00,29133,"I would say, the owner that owned it, turned it around, so it would be harder for someone to take it. Steal it."
1014251,Dutch01,2017-09-25 23:10:00,1431,That sounds like a good guess to me.

1014304,glenner,2017-09-26 16:25:00,56,"When I passed it there were a couple of cars as well as the SUV and a police vehicle there. I went by thinking ""Must have a flat or a minor fender bender"" then a couple of minutes down the road realized ""Hey, the boat was headed the wrong way"""
1014336,grimsbylander,2017-09-27 00:39:00,3016,"LOL...I was gonna say, you're sitting in the left lane??? Ya beat me!!"
1014358,kickingfrog,2017-09-27 16:31:00,8333,Those back trollers take that stuff serious.
1014359,Terry,2017-09-27 17:27:00,14456,Why wouldn't he be in the left lane Maybe I missed something
