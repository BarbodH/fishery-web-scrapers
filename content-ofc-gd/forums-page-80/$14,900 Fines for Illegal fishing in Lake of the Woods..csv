1013736,BillM,2017-09-19 15:34:00,17367,Now if they could lay similar fines on the white bucket brigade we'd get somewhere.
1013737,manitoubass2,2017-09-19 15:38:00,11391,Nice!
1013738,DJGeneral,2017-09-19 15:42:00,163,Now if they could lay similar fines on the white bucket brigade we'd get somewhere. I wish man every time my friends or family from back home asks why we need a license i give em the white bucket brigade stories i have encountered
1013744,AKRISONER,2017-09-19 16:13:00,5558,why in the heck is there such a double standard when it comes to these guys vs others?? is it because they are white canadians that should know better?  these fines are slightly closer to what should be charged against these A holes...but the last story I heard the white bucket brigade was out in the kawarthas fishing without licenses in a fish sanctuary keeping out of season fish and they got like a $500 fine...what a joke.

Any links to actual news stories about the reverse discrimination being proposed here? ie ...White folks being nailed to the cross and other groups handled with kid gloves by all Conservation Officers. It's got the makings of a conspiracy theory!!!

But I did just stumble on example of people with European sounding names getting $5,000 dollar fines...Although in this case the fine is still pretty low considering that they were way, way over their limit.  http://blackburnnews.com/chatham/chatham-news/2017/09/21/fishermen-fined-10000-keeping-many-walleye/  "

1014447,manitoubass2,2017-09-28 23:26:00,11391,Yeah I'd agree but that's a super fine line where many will just claim ignorance.  It's called due diligence people.
