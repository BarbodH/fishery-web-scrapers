The client caught it and when I questioned  it why he let it go, He din’t know That there are two of them. One in Ontario and one in Michigan, Univeristy educated! Never left the 416!!! Could have cost us $250,000 if they wanted a reprint!"

1015177,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-10 19:34:00,8243,"Geography is not a priority to not just Yanks but us Canucks as well. Many of my well educated relatives down south couldn't point out California on a map let alone anywhere in Europe. Most haven't left the state they were born in other than to visit here. I invited all to an Open House in Hamilton last spring for Dad's 90th. More than a few were turned back at the border because they didn't have a passport. What's it been since one is required, 2001?"

1015179,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-10 19:46:00,8243,"Exactly. My Uncle from Western NY and I drove down to St. Louis to see his brother, my uncle, and rather than cross at Buffalo I chose to make the return at Detroit and take the much better and faster 401. Passport requirements had just came into play and he didn't have one. He lost it on the Customs Officer. She calmly told him it wasn't our Queen that made the Passport requirement it was his President Bush 2. Then let us through.  Another M2B2 and JD hi-jacking, sorry."
1015183,manitoubass2,2017-10-10 20:13:00,11391,"No prob brother. I used to ride my bike across the border for work in the US and since my gma was former customs, they'd just wave me though.  Shortly after 9/11 I was going to work, got flagged in and searched. I was detained for about 4-6 hours. Since I didn't have a passport or my birth certificate on me, it was totally different. It wasn't the normal crew. They started rotating customs officers from all over. I had to go to international falls court and pay for a duplicate of my birth certificate with a police escort.  Did that and I was still denied entry.  So then at Canadian customs I also had to fill out a report and documents as to why I was detained and not granted access to cross. That took another 2-hours or so.  Haven't been in the US since. Call me salty because that's exactly what I am.  I was treated like dirt by my own home country.  I have a passport now, but I'll likely never visit my home country again"
1015184,manitoubass2,2017-10-10 20:17:00,11391,That's the fort Frances ON international falls crossingAnyone taking that route I'd suggest having your ducks in a row.What a horrible place to crossThat and they rebuilt the American customs right around that time. It's bonkers. Full scanners etc. From the sky it resembles an American flag in the wind.Google the images.

1015191,aplumma,2017-10-10 21:13:00,6896,how we got from wildfires to border crossing I am not sure. Since the topic is so far off track and was accidently assumed this site is in The US lets put it to bed for now.   Art
