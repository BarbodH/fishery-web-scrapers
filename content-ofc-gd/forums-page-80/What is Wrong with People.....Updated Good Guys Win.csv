1010967,Rod Caster,2017-08-09 17:19:00,5784,"The trout unlimited article sucks. Plus he spelled ""Ottowa"" wrong. Just because AP looks huge, from your computer screen in Idaho, not all of it is inaccessible, or true 'wilderness', plus that's not event the point, that was just his lazy point. The Algonquin natives net some lakes, and this lake would certainly get an influx of visitors were it's name released.  Maybe Mike and his son agreed to keep the lake's name a secret... let's see, keep a promise to your son, or try your darnedest to not offend some deep trout thinkers?? hmmm??  Chris Hunt sounds like an elite-elitist. Taking someone else's point only to make a lackluster point of his own wasn't very inspiring.  Or maybe I'm getting all riled up for nothing... hahaha, this is why I try to avoid comment sections and msg boards"
1011008,smitty55,2017-08-10 01:42:00,928,"For a writer and national director of communications with TU that Chris guy is a twit. This line really gets me. """"How important is it to protect this particular destination when, it would seem, the area is riddled with trophy trout""You would think that the guy would know something about AP, as it's world renowned. Now sure there are tons of trout lakes in the park, but it sure isn't riddled with trophy lakes like he implies. What an idiot.

Good press or bad press Mike wouldn't have been able to reach as many individuals with millions of US greenbacks in marketing it would have cost him. Maybe a Super Bowl commercial.  This guy Chris Hunt is a twitus duffus extraordinairious (Latin for a big numb skull) . To think he is a trout guru is a joke. After all Algonquin is jam packed with world class trout lakes. Something that struck me he says there are over 2500 lakes in the park with ""dozens"" of rivers and streams, ""dozens"". Sometimes I don't think these journalists re read the stuff they write let alone an editor. Grammar, spelling and using a short form or an entire word rather than an acronym, at least once at the beginning of an article, seems to be a lost art. I think we learned that in 8th grade.  I had to edit because I re read what I rote."

Trophy brook trout are very difficult to catch. Just because you fish a trophy lake doesn't mean you'll ever be lucky enough to land one or even get one to bite. That lake was on fire when Mike was there but he also knows what he's doing...something that often gets overlooked I think."

They are required by law to release the records due to the request. Anything the can justify blacking out will be blacked out & this is the reason they contacted Mike. Personal information will be the reason for blacking out large portions of the record.

1010022,Rod Caster,2017-07-27 16:43:00,5784,"FOI request for a fishing spot? hahaha what a loser. Where are the talented hackers when we need them, infect buddy's computer please.  Sorry Mike has to go through this, I'd be receding into the darkness after crap like this.  Best of luck Mike! Hope everything turns out in your favour!"
1010067,Duckie,2017-07-28 00:45:00,305,I'm a little confused as to how someone's private travel itinerary is a matter of public record and allowed to fall under the Freedom of Information Act.  shouldn't this request be flat out denied immediately?
1010081,FloatnFly,2017-07-28 02:47:00,1640,"I'm a little confused as to how someone's private travel itinerary is a matter of public record and allowed to fall under the Freedom of Information Act.  shouldn't this request be flat out denied immediately?  if they view it as a personal trip, yes absolutely.  how with mike being who he is and what he does for a living, they could very well view it as a professional outting, and say that yes, this information needs to be released  its a pretty crappy situation to be in."
1010107,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-28 08:44:00,8243,"Hopefully our Prov Gov moves as fast on this that they do on other important matters. So in 10 years or so the duffus gets his info with all the pertinent facts redacted. That would be justice, the guy is a 2pile."
1010248,FloatnFly,2017-07-30 18:59:00,1640,and the results are in....good guys win!https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1590430057655490&set=a.703573149674523.1073741826.100000655336575&type=3&theater
1010387,BillM,2017-08-01 13:19:00,17367,He can still appeal unfortunately.  I hope this is the last time we hear of it.
1009546,BillM,2017-07-20 16:58:00,17367,"Now people will just keep their reports in their back pocket.  I just can't wrap my head around this, lol"
1009547,RangerGuy,2017-07-20 16:59:00,564,"I don't have any words for this!!!... This is so stupid!  I gotta say those are some WORLD class brookies!! I have always dreamed of trip like that, I thought brookies like that could only be caught is at some crazy expensive Northern fly trip!  Will I put the effort to learn the area and find those fish.. probably never.. but it stays on my bucket list for sure!!! I don't know any fisherman willing to rough it for those fish.. but if I could find someone to do it with .. I'd be in!"
1009548,GBW,2017-07-20 17:33:00,8460,"Now people will just keep their reports in their back pocket.  I just can't wrap my head around this, lol YUP! I hope Terry is right that because his child was with him it's not released"
1009549,grimsbylander,2017-07-20 17:34:00,3016,It really seems ironic that someone can request information under the Act anonymously!? Or did he?
1009550,manitoubass2,2017-07-20 17:45:00,11391,"Yes! It's not only borderline creepy, but I didn't even know you could request such information  With the things I've been though lately, I'd be pissed and fighting that tooth and nail."
1009551,Joeytier,2017-07-20 17:47:00,3990,"Sounds like things are looking up, and the information may not end up being disclosed.  Definitely a precedent-setting story, being in the spotlight of the angling community like this is."
1009552,kickingfrog,2017-07-20 17:47:00,8333,"Not sure how one could argue that there is any need for the right to that information.    On the flip side, if this summers eve gets your info one could then request the camp site info of all the campers in those lakes for the next few years and compare to the last few years and see how many ""new"" names appear. See how twisted this request for information is?"
1009554,grimsbylander,2017-07-20 18:20:00,3016,"Not sure how one could argue that there is any need for the right to that information.

See how twisted this request for information is?  Yup, and cross reference with the members on his forum. I'll just bet he's on there."
1009558,glen,2017-07-20 18:41:00,2641,Im releasing all fishing information live as I fish. I want to get out in front of any freedom of information requests.  Reminds me of one time I was up about 20 fish to 1 with the guy in the front of the boat. I passed him my rod.   He still caught nothing.  Lol.
1009566,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-20 19:35:00,8243,"This is one of the strangest things I have come across in a long while, actually creepy as someone said. Where is OUR privacy today?  I can understand some secrecy especially on small bodies of water. I remember watching an In-Fisherman episode where they proved 2 very good Bass guys could fish out a body of water in 2 days and not a pond. Tagged all the fish and caught only tagged fish day 3. But some go to ridiculous measures to keep there special spots secret. You can be 10 feet away and not catch a fish in the same boat that buddy is slamming them. Just like someone said above. There's more to it than knowing the body of water. I hope the creep goes to the lake and falls overboard, or better yet get SKUNKED. That would be justice for the goof."
1009568,SirCranksalot,2017-07-20 19:42:00,3291,"im sure a piece of crap like that would be too lazy to get into those lakes....its not an easy trekk!  my fear would be that the loser would post the lakes publicly....if so he would be publicly shamed  what bad character That's the ironic part. Very few people reading Mike's post would go through all the effort to get to those lakes. I am quite an avid canoeist and have, in my younger days, done some rough portages---not as tough as they did,though. That would be well beyond my capabilities right now."
1009569,John Bacon,2017-07-20 19:44:00,3277,I think if he goes with the fact that a minor boy was camping at those locations  and it would be against the minors civil rights  to disclose  that info it may get blocked  Shouldn't is go against anybody's civil rights regardless of their age?
1009578,Terry,2017-07-20 20:34:00,14456,"i agree but if he pushes the government that he will sue if they give out info  that tracks his minor son ,the fact that they are asking for the location that a minor sleeps  and goes to the washroom he just might stop it"
1009579,aplumma,2017-07-20 20:52:00,6896,An update is Mike has been in contact with them and has files a complaint to be reviewed. This has taken up quite a bit of his time and I am sure we here at OFC will be supporting him if he needs it. Thanks for all of the support and if you want to read the latest you can find his facebook page here.  https://www.facebook.com/mike.borger.71?fref=ufi  Always a good read here.  Art
1009586,chris.brock,2017-07-20 21:43:00,4053,"I know what you're saying, but those spring brook trout guys can be a passionate bunch. They'd go to the moon if they thought the mother load of brookies was there. In some of Mike's other posts, he said he got bombarded with guys asking where he was in the park.  It will be interesting to see how this one plays out."
1009595,misfish,2017-07-20 23:06:00,29133,"The real shame is, that we share our adventures, trials and tribulations of a fishing episode. It for the most of us, is to share and hope each and everyone, will enjoy our outings. Why do others need to know the wheres? Why, can you just not read or watch the great adventure from those that have put the time in?  I do not get the law thing here, or do I understand what it means.  This is another mess the WWW has created and  become.  I am not a FB fan, nor a member. Im sure these fishing sites are of no difference, but not the same following numbers as FB. You tube is no different. Yes I post on said site, but I post not to be a bused, or to be asked where, but to share my fishing delight. If I were to come across what Mike has, I would stop posting.  I am no Mike Borger, I am but a spit of what he has done. I goof around with my reports,they are minuscule,but no matter, a post of fishing, no scratch that, a post of any means, dose not give the right  of anyone, to ask, or , demand, info of the said report.  I know from reading many reports, Mike has helped many people, yet he gets this slap in the face. Someone is trying to pull strings here. I hope that someone loops a string on this persons balls and pulls it so tight, his balls turn blue and purple, then fall off like a unwanted mole.  With that said  We are our own worst enemy in this WWW. Sad ,as it may be, it is true, and very SAD.  Win this one for the future Mike"

1009604,Dutch01,2017-07-21 00:09:00,1431,"That's crazy. I'm not shocked someone would stoop to this level, but I'm shocked the MNR is even considering the request."

1009491,FloatnFly,2017-07-20 12:01:00,1640,"For those that aren't on facebook, Mike Borger recently recently went on a trip to Algonquin back lakes and caught some monster brookies with his son.  He did not want to give out the location of the lakes in the videos and pictures he was posting.  Fair enough, happens all the time.  But now, some jealous idiot has taken it to the next level of stupid.  They contacted the MNR requesting Mikes camp locations via the Freedom of Information Act.  Algonquin does keep record of where you camp.  If this goes through, those fishing trips to hidden lakes with monster fish, won't be so secret anymore.  Absolute stupidity!  Mikes facebook page  https://www.facebook.com/mike.borger.71  "
1009492,GBW,2017-07-20 12:08:00,8460,"That is total Bull that they want that and probably feel because they read his report they should be given GPS location.  So sad how things have gotten and they are only getting worse in this world of ""gimmy, gimmy"" people out there."
1009499,vance,2017-07-20 12:48:00,719,"What a new low has this person sunk to,I can't believe that someone would use the the freedom of information act to find someones fishing spots. Its a real waste of the MNR's time for sure..  Vance"
1009500,Ralph Field,2017-07-20 13:05:00,1018,"I agree, a new low indeed. Mike now knows he cannot give any any information about location. It's a sad world we live in."
1009503,Dan668,2017-07-20 13:21:00,1120,"Wow, that's pathetic."
1009504,woodenboater,2017-07-20 13:38:00,2277,"there was a time when all the rangers wanted to know when I went interior was the colour of my tent, and tarp if I had one."
1009506,manitoubass2,2017-07-20 14:11:00,11391,Unreal. Especially knowing Mike put in a tonne of legwork himself to organize the trip/lakes etc  Jesus people can be rediculous
1009510,Governator,2017-07-20 14:20:00,879,That's the most pathetic thing I've ever read in my life.
1009513,grimsbylander,2017-07-20 14:22:00,3016,I suggest we request this guys home address under the Freedom of Information Act.
1009519,chris.brock,2017-07-20 14:50:00,4053,"That's exactly what I said on FB, hahaha, Mike doesn't think it would work but it's only $5 for an FOI request, why not try? At least it might bog things down."
1009521,Fisherman,2017-07-20 14:59:00,7201,Laziness has reached a new high.
1009522,jimmer,2017-07-20 15:02:00,2730,"The real sad part is that Mike just might stop sharing his adventures with the rest of us. What a jerk....... I wish the MNR would have told the guy where to go, which would be the proper response in my books."
1009524,woodenboater,2017-07-20 15:14:00,2277,"So the take away, in the end, is that we're all going to stop posting TR's on social media unless it's a very well known area that everyone and their mother, knows about."
1009525,John Bacon,2017-07-20 15:24:00,3277,Camping locations are personal information that should not be released.I would consider filing a complaint to police because the request could be considered stalking.
1009526,DanD,2017-07-20 15:28:00,2223,"You know if this guy would have actually contacted Mike, via a PM or phone; Mike would have likely supplied him with all the info he wanted. He sure helped me, when my brother and I went to Beteau Lake.  Dan."
1009527,farsider,2017-07-20 15:33:00,456,"If they comply at all with this request, my guess is all pertinent info will be redacted.  Silly beyond measure.  Applicant should be exposed and properly tarred and feathered.  Cheers,  Mark"

1009533,glen,2017-07-20 15:49:00,2641,If the greaser gets the locations can I use the freedom of information act to get the locataions from the greaser.
1009534,Sterling,2017-07-20 15:54:00,477,Mike's excellent report in case anyone is wondering; http://www.canadafishingguide.net/trophy-brook-trout-of-algonquin-park/  I do recognize that one lake though. Refer to this google maps link  Sorry while funny it breaks our rules. Feel free to P.M. Sterling for the link.   Art
1009536,SirCranksalot,2017-07-20 16:03:00,3291,Now that is hard cor fish porn!!
1009537,jimmer,2017-07-20 16:13:00,2730,"Finally checked out Mike's report on his trip.  I hope the MNR doesn't reveal the locations to this guy, it could ruin that lake fairly quickly."
