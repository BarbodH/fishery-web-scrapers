1014299,captpierre,2017-09-26 15:32:00,2521,Have my MinnKota plug  come loose often lately. 3 prong screw in.  24 volt I guess these things wear out. 10 yrs old. I'm thinking replacing the receptacle will solve the problem. Do I need to replace the plug too? Thanks

1014310,Garnet,2017-09-26 17:56:00,2056,"Bay Distributors would have the plug. In all places North Bay.  You could switch to a 4 prong Hubble plug. The AC ones are at Home Depot, CTC. And the DC ones at BPS.  And as sinker said wire direct which is some times not good when smoke starts rolling out of trolling motor.  Can you use some electrical tape to hold plug together."

If one part it worn, it is likely the other other is. and poor connections = lost voltage and high resistance - which equals heat. even if you have a circuit breaker or fuse up line of the plug, they can melt or catch fire.  The loose connection also allows water to seep into the plug when it gets wet from waves or rain. that can get pretty messy too."
