1014639,Dutch01,2017-10-02 00:29:00,1431,Update:  http://www.cp24.com/mobile/news/body-pulled-from-water-in-search-for-missing-gta-boaters-on-sturgeon-lake-1.3614609  One body found. RIP.  Not wearing that PFD turned out to be a costly mistake. Very unfortunate for those left behind.
1014640,woodenboater,2017-10-02 01:26:00,2277,gonna guess alcohol was involved or a few were non swimmers. such needless deaths (presuming they're going to find the second body) and probably young with their future before them...
1014647,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-02 03:32:00,8243,"Alcohol, bullet proof youthfulness and water late at night. A formula for disaster. I think we can all say we've been there done that at least once when we were unstoppable and young.  Condolences to the unfortunate friends and family. A waste of life, just a waste, tragic. It will happen again unfortunately, and probably sooner than later."
1014648,manitoubass2,2017-10-02 03:36:00,11391,"Yep, been there  Tragedy for sure. I feel for those that lost."
1014652,grimsbylander,2017-10-02 14:52:00,3016,"I'd say we all have things we look back on and shake our heads about. I sure as heck do. Some of us survive and unfortunately, some become stats. It's just a shame when it does turn tragic and young lives are lost. Those left behind will never be the same."
1014659,npt1,2017-10-02 19:39:00,220,I totally agree with O I and Grimsbylander. That could have been me when I was young and unstoppable. My condolences to all the familys.
