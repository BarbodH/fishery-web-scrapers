Taking my grandson to Orillia for hockey tournament early November, thought I might give it a try between games but have no idea if there is any worthwhile fishing at that time.  I was wondering if anyone has been there in the fall, and where to try.  No boat, fishing from shore.    Thanks"

I,ll bet he,ll be pleased to just enjoy fishing with you. I would say you will catch pan fish no problem.  I always looked for a place to fish when we did the travel hockey tourneys.  Good luck to him and his team."

I now have 9 nieces, all are girly girls that won't touch a fish. One was born just the other day, I am going to try and get her on the water ASAP."

Just to sit on the shore  away from the rink and talk, is well worth it.  Old Ironmaker,  Agree 100% on that!  Hope you have better luck with the newborn, she might surprise you."
