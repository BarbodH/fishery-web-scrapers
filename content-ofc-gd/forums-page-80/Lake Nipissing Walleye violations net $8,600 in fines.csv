1014717,G.mech,2017-10-03 00:43:00,830," From the linked article:  More of the same crap, people that don't care about the rules are never gonna care.  I do find it ironic though that the punishment for fishing without a license is a two year license suspension....that'll show 'em!"
1014718,Fisherman,2017-10-03 00:46:00,7201,"Hahaha, like he really cared about the licence in the first place."
1014731,John Bacon,2017-10-03 13:06:00,3277,Wouldn't you have to have a license in order for it to be suspended?

1014736,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-03 14:39:00,8243,"I just read that on MNR Watch. I'm not a river fisher guy anymore, I have to ask why the authorities don't blitz these commonly known spots of obvious infractions every year. Everyone here knows where and when and have known for years, don't the authorities know as well? Maybe they have in the past, some of you guys might know if the Ministry has been pro active. I don't know if more violators have been charged and convicted or Social Media enables us to hear of what goes on that we never had access to before. I hope it's both. It seems there are recent fines doled out weekly. I have to laugh when a poacher that never had a licence is banned from fishing for a year, Yea right. ""No buddy I can't poach anymore with you because I am banned from poaching for a year.""  If you don't subscribe to MNR Watch newsletter I again recommend you do."

Enforcement of fishing violations has always been put on the back burner in the fall as CO's turn their manpower to hunting season."
