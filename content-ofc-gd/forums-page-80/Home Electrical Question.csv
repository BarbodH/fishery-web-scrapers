1014489,Old Ironmaker,2017-09-29 17:46:00,8243,I learned my lesson re: Outdoor GFI's years ago. The first think to check but someone mentioned it here early. Glad you have seen the light.
1014493,jimmer,2017-09-29 18:48:00,2730,"That would have been my first guess Old Ironmaker, if I hadn't change the darn thing last year and the plugs were working. I guess I have now learned the lesson."
1014496,Old Ironmaker,2017-09-29 18:59:00,8243,"I checked out a bad exterior light for days, maybe weeks at a new to me home. No way was I calling in a favour, how hard can it be to change a light bulb? Finally I found a GFI on a wall buried behind shrubbery. Someone had to tell me what it was and show me how to reset it. I am electrically challenged. I needed my Electricians at the plant change the batteries in my flashlight. I kid you not. I will not touch anything I can't see, smell, hear or feel since a 110 sent me 8' across a room cracking the drywall on my very first and last elec. DIY.  My Dad and Father-in-law couldn't stop laughing as I cried messaging my elbows. Yea funny."
1014505,jimmer,2017-09-29 20:09:00,2730,"Yikes, I think I was close to that when I discover that the two switches in one box were on two different circuits. My wife freaked on me when the sparks were flying, I was lucky. Not funny. :-("
1014509,Old Ironmaker,2017-09-29 21:00:00,8243,"Yep Jimmer, electricity I leave to the electricians or brave friends that think they know what they are doing, just like Surgery and Dentistry sometimes you just have to ""call the guy"".  Although I have tried the last 2 as DIY, it worked out better than the 110 shock.  An electrical story. My buddy who played D line in the CFL insisted he could hook up the 220 for the dryer. He tells me to shut off the power. The panel is 12' away. I am about to pull all the power in the panel and I hear a scream. He's flipping out because the power was still on. Like I said I don't know much about electricity but I do think if he got zapped with 220 me thinks he would be cooking like a side of beef, a rather large side. No matter he went well over 300 pounds at the time. I think he pinched his finger on a heavy gauge wire and did not get zapped, I don't know for sure. He didn't have any hair to catch fire but he sure was red after yelling at me for 5 minutes. You didn't want him angry with you."
1014511,lew,2017-09-29 21:15:00,12766,50 something years ago when I was in the Navy one of our ships electricians was changing a 440 amp fuse. Nobody really knows what happened but he somehow touched the contacts with bare hands and was blown across the room and  instantly electrocuted.  We were only a couple hours helicopter fight to a land based hospital but he was dead while we were loading him aboard.  Lousy story but it shows that even well trained guys can get in huge trouble with electricity.
1014515,Fisherman,2017-09-29 21:49:00,7201,"Ah yes, a certain thing that the Military did not like was hands in your pockets, except when working on high powered electronics at the GATR sites."
1013982,jimmer,2017-09-22 14:42:00,2730,"I know this is a stretch without seeing the wiring, but thought by throwing it out there, something might click. I have an outdoor flood light that has been there for over 30 years. I just recently replaced the bulb and it was working fine until the other day.  I checked the bulb in another socket and it worked, so I thought it was the fixture, which I replaced and it still didn't work. Next, I replaced the light switch and it still doesn't work. Any tips or ideas would be appreciated. Thanks, Jim"
1013983,ch312,2017-09-22 15:07:00,1590,"So you replaced the entire flood light along with the switch and the breaker/fuse is on, but the light still doesn't work?  I'd start by using a circuit tester or voltmeter to see if you're getting power to the switch and if so, test to see if it's making it to the light or not. I'm going to guess rodents damaging the wiring as the light worked for so many years and suddenly there is apparently no power going to the light."
1013984,BillM,2017-09-22 15:10:00,17367,Use a multimetre to figure out if you're getting power to the fixture when the switch is flipped?
1013986,OhioFisherman,2017-09-22 15:30:00,6623,"I am just guessing, but I doubt that only one light has it's own fuse - circuit breaker, electrical outlets nearby working?"
1013987,Terry,2017-09-22 15:39:00,14456,I would think it is a connection problem. At an outlet or light near by that feeds it  You need to turn the breaker off and see what else turns off th n start checking if they feed that light A multimeter would find the problem pretty quick
1013988,jimmer,2017-09-22 15:42:00,2730,"The trick is finding which circuit it is on without being able to see the light go out when shutting the breaker off. There is power going to the switch (never mind how I know that), I now shut the whole house off when dealing with that switch which is a double one, but each switch seems to be on a different circuit.  I thought about rodent damage, but the length of wire from switch to fixture is like 6 feet, but probably the problem.  Hate to have to open up a wall to get at it. Multimetre at the fixture is the next step. Thanks,"
1013989,Terry,2017-09-22 15:50:00,14456,Outlets or lights near by should be on the same circuit On mine the outside lights and an outlet outside are all on the same circuit along with outlets on the outside wall in the dining room right near the outside lights
1013994,cheaptackle,2017-09-22 16:16:00,849,"On the outside chance that the exterior lights and outlets are on the same circuit I'd look to see if a GFI outlet was installed and maybe tripped.  This would mean power came from the panel to the outlet before going to the switch, then to the light.  It's not really normal but whose to say what's been done over the years.  Without some pictures or actually being there it's hard to diagnose.  The wire being disturbed by animals between the switch and light is a good possibility IF the wire is accessible to such a disturbance.  The good thing here is once you find the problem you'll have much better insight as to how your house is wired.  And if you do have to change out chewed wire to the light, use bx (armored) so they don't chew it again!  Michael"
1013997,ketchenany,2017-09-22 16:22:00,3229,"I think cheap tackle has it, most outside fixtures are on a GFI circuit. Weather protected . . .  Let us know what you find. I had hell of a problem with a GFI and I'm not an electrical guy!"
1013999,jimmer,2017-09-22 16:31:00,2730,"I checked the outside GFI, which was replaced last year and seems to be separate and used all the time.. I'm wondering if it is connected with the GFI in the washroom which is old and is fairly close. I will let everyone know what I find."
1014001,cheaptackle,2017-09-22 16:48:00,849,"Washroom GFI, if done right, should be on it's own circuit.  Tell me about the switch controlling the outside light - is the black and white wires attached to the switch OR are there 2 white wires in a wire nut with two black wires attached to the switch?  Michael"
1014006,jimmer,2017-09-22 17:34:00,2730,Two white wires in a wire nut and the two black wires go to the switch.
1014022,cheaptackle,2017-09-22 19:00:00,849,"OK that means that the power is most likely coming directly to the switch from another device (outlet etc) or the panel rather than a junction box.  What we need to determine is where the fault is.  Let's see if we have power to the switch first. With the power OFF (breaker if known for sure or whole house) remove the wire nut and untwist the white wires.  Disconnect and remove switch.  Make sure all 4 wires are spread well apart.  Turn power on.  Using multimeter in 200VAC range, test one black and white, changing but always one black and one white until you get a read between 110-120 volts.  This identifies which pair are power coming in and that they are hot/good.  If no reading then you have no power coming in.  If there are no other devices affected by this breaker then the problem is between the panel and the light switch.  IF other devices are on this breaker and working, the problem is between the last device working and the switch.  If you have power then move on to the next. So let's test the wire to the fixture now. Next, with the power off again, remove the light fixture. Lightly twist the black and white wires in the fixture together.  At the switch ensure you've untwisted the white wires and disconnected the blacks.  Using the ohmmeter function on the multimeter or the continuity tester (usually beeps on a digital) touch the probes to one black and one white, changing but always one black and one white.  Note which ones give continuity or beep, they should be the two not identified as being hot.  Untwist the wires at the fixture and repeat.  When you cease getting results on one pair then the wire to the fixture is good.  Retwist wires at fixture to verify, then untwist.  You have now verified which wires feed the fixture and that they are good. One of these two tests should fail - meaning no power coming in or no power from switch to fixture.  If both pass, hook it all up (power off of course) power up and check the wires in the fixture box.  If this fails when the other two both pass together - y'all gotta bad switch, which can happen with new ones though rare. I'll be in/near coboconk over the turkey weekend working for one of my other customers.  PM me before then by a couple of days and I might be able to drop by if you haven't cured it by then. The foregoing should give you what you need to know though.  Michael  Michael"

1014053,DRIFTER_016,2017-09-23 01:50:00,10439, If the OP is set up similarly he should check the outside outlets as one is likely a GFCI outlet and maybe tripped.

(someone was right) The next step is to pull that and have a look.  I had changed that GFI last year though. Mike's suggestions were very helpful, but still not comfortable with a multimetre. Couldn't get a steady reading on the 200acv setting. I just hooked up a fixture directly to the wires in the switch box to determine no power, but determined the wire between the switch and fixture was good using ohm reading."
