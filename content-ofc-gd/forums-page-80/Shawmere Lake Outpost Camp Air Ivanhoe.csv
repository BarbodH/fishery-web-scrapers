My brother and I have fished this Lake in the past and always had great success. We left early Thursday morning and made it to the Air base by 1:30 in the afternoon. The plan was to spend the night at the Lodge and Fly out Friday morning. As we were sitting in the Lodge and making the final payment for the trip, our pilot Joel Theriault offered to fly us in that afternoon so we unloaded the truck got our gear weighed and before you knew it we were on our way to Shawmere Lake. It was nice to Fly in that afternoon as this allowed us to get everything set up in camp and get out for an early fish Friday morning.This camp has been closed for the last 2 years and just reopened June 30th of this year and has seen extensive renovations such as a big screened in porch running water at the sink and a shower and vanity and the camp is now all run on solar power with an Inverter  and 12 volt batteries and a 3000 watt generator it even has a small freezer.Now to the fishing we caught a good number of walleye everyday under very tough conditions  warm temps and bright sunny skies with no wind and as an added bonus we got in to a few nice Northerns. This lake has an abundance of Walleye in the 16 to 17 inch range we only got a few that were over 18 to 20 inches which is fine by us as we are not Trophy guys it is all about the numbers all and all it was another great trip I would like to Thank the Theriault family and there staff at Air Ivanhoe for another great trip.  Cheers Mitch"
