1014354,oldphart,2017-09-27 13:37:00,665,"~~~~Have a few small items to be repaired on my Widdle Gween Twacker, she is over 20years old. First item to fix was the Relay switch for the power trim, then there is the Speedometer Pilot sensor(little white probe at the stern). then them out on YouTube, and the task were very easy to do. The only problem is finding the parts, have you ever called up a Marina, and was told ""we'll have to order it in"" and when you call back to see if it has arrive to be told they forgot to order it, or it's no longer in stock. Well I have found a great source for parts. "" Central Outboard Marina"" in Markham. Each time I've called they have had the part in stock, now I'm sure there are others, But i'll not be calling any marinas for parts"
