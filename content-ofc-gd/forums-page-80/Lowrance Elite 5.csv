1014366,300,2017-09-27 23:15:00,16,Hello. Went to a new lake the other day. Horseshoe by Parry Sound My Elite5 had Sonar but no navigation.  It's like it didn't recognize the lake. Any tips ?  Thanks

1014373,Rizzo,2017-09-28 02:04:00,4754,"not all lakes have been mapped would be my guess...and even if it had, is that lake included in your Package on the chip you have"
1014385,fishindevil,2017-09-28 10:19:00,6254,there is many many lakes and rivers that are not on navionics and some that are are totally inaccurate anyways in fact over 3/4 of the lakes I fish are not on navionics you get used to it after a while.....

You can share the data, or mark it private. Then put the card back in your graph and download your new map. There are lots of YouTube videos that walk you through the process.  The maps are only as good as the data you feed into it. Make two or three passes through a bay and its pretty sketchy. After multiple passes over multiple trips it gets to be surprisingly detailed."
1014391,300,2017-09-28 11:22:00,16,"Yes Chip was in. Took out, cleaned it, and put back in Funny I'm 1/2 hr from Georgian bay and it picks it up.  Mmmm"
1014412,Terry,2017-09-28 15:28:00,14456,I'm 1/2 hr from Georgian bay and it picks it up. Mmmm  Sorry.  Picks what up?
1014413,Raf,2017-09-28 15:30:00,3495,"its simple. georgian bay is charted, horseshoe lake is not."
1014414,AKRISONER,2017-09-28 15:41:00,5558,Much of georgian bay is also not charted...take a look at the area around the shawanaga river you will see that there is nothing there.
1014446,spincast,2017-09-28 23:23:00,3279,"Have you done any updates ? Likely, the lake isnt charted on the device / chip. To find out put chart on full screen (you can do this from home) zoom out. waaaay out so that you are like google earth view, all of ontario. now slowly zoom in. you should see dotted lines on the chart. These are the charted / uncharted zones. If your lake is outside the dotted line where you have depths, you need a different card. You can check by identifying an area you know is charted, and look to a lake just outside the dotted line that one is in. Zoom in looking for contours on each lake. If you ever get out Woodstock way, you can take it  into Angling outfitters. They'll answer all your questions, as well as know the card that has your lake on it........ Just don't be in a hurry"
