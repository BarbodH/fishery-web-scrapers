Wake the next day and force themselves to do something they do not like and sometimes even despise. I took my pension at age 45, everyone thought I was out of my mind. I made big money and had to  deal with big numbskulls and the world coming to the end day in and day out. I could have made a million more staying 10 more years. So freeking what. It's been 17 years and I don't regret that decision to get out while I still could with most of my fingers and toes. Moved to the lake and we can fish from our own little beach, or swim or do didley squat. Plus we haven't missed a meal.  Enjoy life while you still can, good luck to you and thanks for the invite. You never know, my sis and brother in law just bought a beautiful  property on Mahon Bay for what is maybe 6 years of property taxes in Toronto."

1014550,Old Ironmaker,2017-09-30 14:15:00,8243,"I love Nova Scotia and we were contemplating moving to the area you are 17 years ago. That was until I realized they get 8 months of winter, 2 months of Hurricanes and 2 months of paradise. We do not enjoy rain, snow and cold so we sucked out and bought in Florida."

One of them was from there ....can't remember husband or wife.... but man where they excited about it.  There excitement  was infectious and I remember driving away and telling Debbe how happy I was for them.  Grab it with both hands and enjoy it. We all only get to do this dance just once.
