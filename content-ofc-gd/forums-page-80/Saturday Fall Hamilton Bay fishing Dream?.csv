I'm scheduled to put the boat away in the next couple of weeks up on Balsam but was hoping a few hours on the Hamilton Bay may have some success?  The forums here point to Williams Coffee area for a chance of something.  Doesn't need to be big or pretty and definitely will be released.  I've heard many times of walleye stocking but again, beggars can't be choosy.  Any hints or tips (lures/bait)would be appreciated as I'm dreaming of a few calm hours, a few bites, photo or 2, coffee, and back home before the puck drops!  I know, I know, not asking too much!"

1014957,Freshtrax,2017-10-07 14:17:00,2215,If be trolling  deep diving cranks in 30-60 in the area inside the bridge might get a salmon.
1014987,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-08 00:56:00,8243,"I would suggest trolling what is referred to as the West Side open cut. Warm city water is discharged there from Stelco. Many Salmon and even Pike in the 90's were trapped in the bay water strainers there when the bay was a cesspool as far back as the 70's. Because of the warm water they seemed to school there. It is located at the south east corner along the dock wall where Stelco and International Harvester property merged. Don't think about eating a fish from the Bay, please."
