1014127,super dave,2017-09-24 18:08:00,323,"I just purchased my first boat. Older 14 aluminum, fairly wide and moderately deep.   The front hood is aluminum and round, as seen in the picture.   Can this be removed?   I'd like to replace it with a flat piece of wood with carpet so I can accommodate a trolling motor.   Any thoughts?  Also where can I get marine carpet around TO? "
1014130,misfish,2017-09-24 18:49:00,29133,"I would remove it, and I would also get that back over hang, on the trailer more. I do not like that. No sir, not at all."
1014131,Terry,2017-09-24 18:57:00,14456,yeah change the front  the trailer with the boat on it is not legal for the road
1014132,cheaptackle,2017-09-24 19:00:00,849,"Brian is very right about this Dave - the bunks should end right at the transom.  Can't tell from the picture if you have enough tongue to move the mast ahead far enough.  You may also need to move the axle ahead too or all the weight will be on the tongue and may affect how it pulls along with becoming a back breaker if you ever try to move it manually. As for modifying the enclosed bow, you may not gain all that much for the effort.  Not sure if it has a hatch in it or if you could cut one in to see how much it may benefit you, but consider too that the existing is good for mounting the trolling motor to.  Check out the renovations sections on iboat.com for some great ideas!  Michael"
1014135,misfish,2017-09-24 19:15:00,29133,Can you post a pic of the full trailer/boat please. This would help Dave.
1014137,Carp,2017-09-24 19:34:00,1488,Congrats on the first boat !
1014146,Old Ironmaker,2017-09-24 20:16:00,8243,Looks something like me and the boys first tinny. You MUST get that tongue weight correct. What you intend on doing at the bow is fine. There may be easier ways of mounting a troller. Home Depot has carpeting fine for a boat as long as you don't intend on leaving it open to the element. Sometime the difference between Marine and commercial carpeting is the price$$$. Actually there isn't any carpet that will take all the rain and snow.
1014148,super dave,2017-09-24 20:28:00,323,Thanks for the advice.   I'm picking it up in a few weeks.   Previous owner said he would fix the trailer lights.   From memory I believe there is room to move things up so I'll have to look into that. Lots to learn!
1014158,cisco,2017-09-24 22:10:00,597,"Trolling motor fold down assembly will work on that front cap. Need a few rubber -mat type pads/spacers to get the cap level where you bolt the fold-down onto, and some 1/2 inch thick and approx 2 inch wide wood slats to bolt the assembly through the aluminum and through the wood for a sturdy result. Use lock nuts, washers and large washers against the wood underneath. Did that on two boats. No big deal."
1014162,dintymoore,2017-09-24 22:28:00,62,"Funny, I saw that on Kijiji the other morning. At 950 bucks it seemed it may be a steal."
1014163,John Bacon,2017-09-24 22:54:00,3277,I wouldn't remove the from hood.  Just run some planks down each side and attach a flat platform to the planks.As others have said; something needs to be done about the trailer.  The bunks should extend right to transom.  You may need to both move the boat forward and install longer bunks.
1014164,OhioFisherman,2017-09-24 22:57:00,6623,"I would remove it, and I would also get that back over hang, on the trailer more. I do not like that. No sir, not at all.  My first thought when I saw the picture also, even with a light motor the transom area will take a pounding when trailer-ed."
1014165,smitty55,2017-09-24 23:12:00,928,I sure wouldn't remove that front cowling or you'll lose all the strength and integrity of the bow. For sure though you could bolt through it to mount a bracket for your tm.Or else just go with a transom mount electric.  Cheers
1014238,super dave,2017-09-25 19:55:00,323,"Thanks again fellas.   I'll have to take a look at the trailer again and see if I can move forward and/or extend the bunks.   If not, looks like I'm shopping for a new trailer. So from this view, I'm assuming this trailer would fit a 12 footer perfectly?"
1014239,cheaptackle,2017-09-25 20:25:00,849,"Judging strictly by the amount that boat is overhanging the trailer I'd say it is set up for more like a 10 footer, maybe 11, but it should adapt to 12.  Can't really see the bunks so it's hard to say for sure.  Michael"
1014241,misfish,2017-09-25 20:41:00,29133,"I sure wouldn't remove that front cowling or you'll lose all the strength and integrity of the bow. For sure though you could bolt through it to mount a bracket for your tm.Or else just go with a transom mount electric.  Cheers   A flatter plate can be mounted on the bow once the old one is removed, instead of whats there.  A 3/8"" aluminum plate will still keep the strength on the bow. I would make one that is half the distance covered. Then you can mount you trolling motor with ease. If you handy, you can do this easy."

1014476,MrSimon,2017-09-29 14:47:00,217,"Looks like a great first boat.  Congrats!  You can absolutely remove the front aluminum hood and replace it with flat carpeted wood.  Use good stainless hardware and bolt it in place to the gunwales.  For the trailer ... slide the front bow arm forward a foot, lengthen the bunks a foot or so in both directions and go fishing.  It won't be ideal, but it will be safe and support the boat better.  Don't forget the basic maintenance items:   If you keep up with the things above, that set-up will last you forever.  Literally.    "
