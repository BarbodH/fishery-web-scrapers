1015129,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-10 03:12:00,8243,"I use it for sore joints, it works.  A pal of mine and I were fishing off the lift bridge pier in Hamilton. He pulls out his pecker and pees in the water, he says ""That's what I use for fish attractor."" I pull mine out and tell him, ""Man is that water ever cold."""

1015144,MCTFisher9120,2017-10-10 13:39:00,3761,"I've used Hog Tonic Garlic 1-2 times a day every day for the last 3 or 4 years now. Has made a huge difference for me. Always when I'm pitching jigs/craw's I make sure when I tie on the bait is soaked. Hog Tonic has amino acids in it so if you give the plastic 5-10 minutes it will soak it in and last all day. We soak our hollow belly frog's, swimbait's/swim jigs etc with scent also, it never draw's a strike but I believe keeps a fish holding onto the bait for a extra few seconds while let the fish take the bait.  I believe in scent and will continue to use it."
1015149,manitoubass2,2017-10-10 14:21:00,11391,I've been an on again off again user of scents.  Mainly gulp(the bottle kind) but I'll use minnows etc in the prepackaged gulp bags.  I still believe that nocotine stained hands is a major deterrent unless using live bait  The worst baits I ever used and seemed to actually not catch fish was trigger x.
1015156,grimsbylander,2017-10-10 15:24:00,3016,"Laugh but it works as well as any other attractants. Plus its a dual purpose item, ointment by night, fish bait by day. LOL  Dan   Just don't use it in a tournament. Shrinking fish is a bad thing."
846071,OhioFisherman,2014-04-06 23:07:00,6623,"gypsy bait oil, a memory from a different era, it smelled like black licorice, anise oil was in it."
909600,netminder,2015-04-12 14:38:00,514,"Any downsides or instances when scent wouldn't be used? I have a feeling adding scent is more to mask the smells from your hands rather than actually ""attract"" fish"
909605,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-12 15:08:00,8243,"I was a believer for a long time. I made my own scents with oil of anise which I bought at the pharmacy. I have a bottle holder at the bow of the boat that holds 3 bottles of scents worm, crawfish and garlic. I don't use them anymore and still have zero fish days and limit days. I think they are a confidence thing. Fish with confidence in your equipment, bait, location, weather conditions, electronic ability, etc. and you pay more attention and I believe that results in more fish. If you feel scent gives you more confidence slather it on and it will work."
909681,netminder,2015-04-12 21:11:00,514,Even for soft plastics? I feel like you have to set really fast before they spit that nasty plastic taste.
909685,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-12 21:26:00,8243,We used to marinade tubes in ziplock bags with a splash of oil of anise and a good amount of garlic salt. Maybe this should be on the cooking thread. Putting scents on hard plastics is a waste of money I think as they wash off fast.
909714,msp,2015-04-12 22:43:00,1336,I use scent all the time. I believe it works.
909716,Beans,2015-04-12 22:51:00,3339,"Carpers are famous for using different scents on their baits...  Myself, I like to flavor my boiled maize with a good splash of anise and mix some of the flavored water into my ground bait...  A friend likes to use strawberry koolade...  I also have a bottle of pineapple spray for my boilies..."

1014867,SaugaPikeSlayer,2017-10-05 22:24:00,48,"Here's a little something that may have helped a couple of weeks ago when  I wasn't getting any bites..I snagged a goby with a spoon...rubbed him all over the spoon before I fed him to a seagull ..3 casts later had a pike on.  Will try this technique for bass next summer.  More on topic..been using the Yum F2 spray, Mike's bass gel, and Shiner Wand alewife chapstick.  I feel the spray comes off after the first cast where as the gel lasts for 15 or so casts and the chapstick stuff stays on forever.  But it's hard to tell if the fish would have bit or not without the scent on.  Does anyone notice a difference using this stuff?"
1014893,scuro2,2017-10-06 02:24:00,904,"I started out with gulp attractant and i dont think it helped or hurt. Then i switched to berkleys scents and i really like the bass one, which i find works better for walleye then anything else lol. Imo they work but i think a lot of that is because it masks the scent on your hands. I can tell ya one thing, if you don't smoke you'll catch more fish. I really believe fish are turned off by that crap  ...experience from Cuba...cigars and suntan lotion are repellents. You have to learn how to apply suntan lotion with one hand only."
1014900,Bernie66,2017-10-06 09:52:00,123,Cod liver oil if you can find them. 500ml bottle. Last a long time. Won't freeze. Put some in a small bottle with a dropper and you are good to go. I even put it on my roe bags to recharge them  on the river.  Know a few old timers that swears by it. Trouble is finding it.  I think I got my last bottle at Walmart under the equate brand. Under $10.
1014902,fishindevil,2017-10-06 10:21:00,6254,I use various scents and use them all them time for bass and walleye and all the years I charter fished on klake Ontario....I believe they will at least hold on that second longer or sometimes follow the scent trail......I know it doesn't hurt as my fishing has never been affected by the use of scent......like I said in another thread I will sometimes throw some baits in a container or package a few hours before im going to use them and give them a soak.........

Garlic scent never seemed to work for me, and rubber smelling plastics are only for quick moving reactions imo .  Fish are foodies nowadays"
1015064,OhioFisherman,2017-10-08 23:31:00,6623,"You can spray a piece of foam with scent and stuff it in a tube, the scent will stay longer."
1015081,captpierre,2017-10-09 14:25:00,2521,Scent has to play a significant role. Anybody that has used real worms will tell you. Like a fish knows what an earthworm is. In my experience GULP will outfish all other plastics especially for the bluegills and smallies  on Pigeon. Never tried GULP spray scent. Maybe should.
1015086,Garnet,2017-10-09 15:48:00,2056,"Threw the middle 80's I jigged spoons for walleye on Quinte. Exact same spoon in each hand one had a glued on rattle, blue ice line and I used doc j on it and minnow. The other just plain with a minnow.  The one with the trixs was streaky and plain was consistent. For 5 years they caught the same amount of walleye.  I won 2 bassmania classics using Kick N Bass. Don't get that stuff in your mouth.  Safe to say I was in and out of scents."
