Mostly 1/100 and 1/80 but I saw some 1/64 and 1/32 oz jigs, various colours.   It's on a side rack near the reel section.  Pretty good deal if u like fishing for panfish, crappie and trout.  Same deal as below except it's on clear out now.  http://www.redflagdeals.com/deal/equipment/white-river-fly-shop-pro-lite-jigs-2/"
