Even better, the chip works in a city’s concrete canyons, and it consumes half the power of today’s generation of chips.  Of course this is directed at cellphones but will trickle down soon enough. Always thought it was a military spec and the ""public"" was only allowed 5m.  One another note, hit LSC last tuesday and went 3 out of 5 muskys in 5 hrs. Nothing huge 43"",34"" and 36"" I believe.  Lake St. Clair is just magic for musky and being able to troll in 15' basically weedless is a dream! Left boat at home and chartered with FISHLSC. That's my buddy in the video as he never gets to fish so I let him play with each one.  "
1014407,BillM,2017-09-28 14:23:00,17367,I thought the 'public' GPS accuracy was set by DoD policy.   Who knows.
1014408,AKRISONER,2017-09-28 14:31:00,5558,"you think trolling motors are bad, try keep on top of the GPS units ahahaha. You cant win!  Buy a unit and its obsolete the next day. I had a big conversation recently about how marcum flashers the ones with the big digital screens are totally obsolete and they only came out about 5 years ago. Marcum is going to literally go out of business because of it.  we just bought a terrova with ipilot and blue tooth...im sure i wont be suffering with the 5 meters vs 30cm. Unless you are a billionaire you cant stay on top of this stuff, the ipilots, the ipilot link the blue tooth capability etc etc it just keeps going on."
1014441,Garnet,2017-09-28 21:54:00,2056,I though gps was variable. 5 meters was the norm and at times it could be much better. And the military didn't share when it was more accurate .

This is what I thought as well...  GPS could be better but it was the military that had the last say in accuracy.
