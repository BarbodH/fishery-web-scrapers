1014179,Freshtrax,2017-09-25 04:40:00,2215,Just started waterfowl hunting and I'm totally addicted after goose hunting for a week and duck hunting this weekend. Live in Kitchener have a Boat and a few decoys just seeing if there is anyone local who would want to meet up / split gas to hunt.
1014200,Sinker,2017-09-25 14:05:00,8692,Hardcore waterfowler here. Fishing gear gets dusty from now till ice up.  S.
1014236,Brettiop,2017-09-25 18:45:00,279,"Same, don't do a ton of fishing for the next few months....Ducks are where its at for now."
1014243,Freshtrax,2017-09-25 21:25:00,2215,Sure is allot more exciting than deer hunting
1014245,huzzsaba,2017-09-25 21:47:00,884,Sure is allot more exciting than deer hunting A friend of mine went for a 3 day deer hunting trip .  Didn't have any luck so he dug up a tree and brought it home
1014247,misfish,2017-09-25 22:17:00,29133,"While was sitting on the bay Saturday morning, the sound of silence was interrupted by the sounds of hunters in near by fields. It brought  me back to when I hunted fowl. I sure miss it.    Sure is allot more exciting than deer hunting   I will say fowl hunting is a BLAST, but taking a deer down, is much more challenging. The reward to me, is much more rewarding."
1014252,Freshtrax,2017-09-25 23:11:00,2215,I hear ya Brian.   I like the solitude and scouting side of deer hunting But the waterfowl stuff is way more social and a heck of allot more shooting.
1014253,Freshtrax,2017-09-25 23:12:00,2215,Just bring the shotgun out on your toon! I'm sure you could can fab. up a gunrack for that thing
1014271,turtle,2017-09-26 01:54:00,274,"I'm interested in waterfowl hunting this year and want to get out in my sit-on kayak.  I'm in Durham region though.  I saw 100's ++ of ducks this spring on Scugog, maybe a touch down on a flyway.  There are some ducks and geese around where I am in Haliburton but the local black ducks seem too tame for me to hunt.  Although they would be hard to miss."
1014281,porkpie,2017-09-26 12:28:00,2521,"Maybe next season, I'm north east of you.  I have spent many years waterfowling  but I'm taking a season off due to time constraints and wanting to get as much use out of my new boat as I can."
1014620,Joeytier,2017-10-01 18:36:00,3990,"I'm itching to get out, but this area is so infested with moose hunters I have to wait until rifle season closes before I can really get out and most of the mallards and woodies are gone by then.  Hoping to try and dial in some northern ducks on the ottawa river later in the season as well."
1014631,raysfish2005,2017-10-01 23:17:00,163,"I was just thinking on my way home i need a few duck buddies, i hunt in the parrsound area, the opener was good but its to warm yet,very few ducks around, sent me a pm if your interested in getting together and trading some spots, I was thinking longpoint on holiday Monday if anyones interested as I have never hunted there befor.  Thanks Ray"
1014722,Freshtrax,2017-10-03 01:31:00,2215,Yea I bet there would be some upset moose hunters if you were blasting away at ducks all day.
1014747,misfish,2017-10-03 20:01:00,29133,"Yea I bet there would be some upset moose hunters if you were blasting away at ducks all day.   LOL  I always found the best duck hunting around here, was during the deer hunt. Guys would be dogging through the bush and swamps, jumping ducks all morning. It was a BLAST of a time.  I see my eye specialist in December. Im going to see what he says about me shooting a shotgun. I am worried about the recoil and shock to the head from the blasting. I would like to get out again. If he says no, then Im good with that.  Bow hunting is in my plans next year. Working out things like property and ATV help.  Oh Terry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
1014752,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-03 22:08:00,8243,"Any of you ""birdheads"" are more than welcome to come out here for a hunt. The birds come here right out front of our placeon the north shore of Erie by the thousands. Everything from Goldeneye to Bufflehead, I called them Buffalohead's before I was educated in my Duck breeds. I don't hunt but a few pals do come to our place every fall to sit on the beach or the rock outcropping in a blind and get more than a few. I personally don't hunt any longer because the hunting seems to be best on the most miserable days. It's nice and warm and dry in the cottage with my Binoculars at the ready.  Just PM me."
