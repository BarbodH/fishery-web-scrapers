1014566,misfish,2017-09-30 18:53:00,29133,Thanks Dave.  Im still looking for a up to date site. No luck    Not a good thing.  Thats a lot of silt being spewed out from the upper lake too.
1014569,dave524,2017-09-30 19:30:00,4508,"  Not a good thing.  Thats a lot of silt being spewed out from the upper lake too.  another pic with stranded fish, hopefully spring runoff will flush the silt. I would think most successful reproduction takes place further upstream.  22046501_2077182605893876_4839928927406872325_n by D T, on Flickr"
1014572,SirCranksalot,2017-09-30 20:28:00,3291,Hundreds? Sounds a bit excessive. Did most get killed up in the pond?

1014601,SirCranksalot,2017-10-01 14:50:00,3291,"Apparently there was no flow over the dam or the ladder, so I guess downstream got pretty dry. The first time I saw this I understood that it was only the ladder that was dry."
1014605,FloatnFly,2017-10-01 15:03:00,1640,All the more reason to get rid of dams.....this sucks
1014610,misfish,2017-10-01 16:13:00,29133,"Got to talk to a young fella today on the river. Seems yes, the ladder was the issue. Many anglers dropped their gear to get as many fish back into the river.  They had the ladder working again by 10 pm .There were some that did not make it sadly."
1014623,MJIG,2017-10-01 19:29:00,227,Arent there alternative ways of constructing ladders so that the steps and pools maintain a certain depth of water in the case of a situation where the flow stops?
1014634,Fisherman,2017-10-01 23:42:00,7201,$$$$$.  You would think they can install a simple alarm system or automatic notification on power failures.
1014871,farsider,2017-10-05 23:10:00,456,Good account here.  Looks like kudos are due to John Kendell of the Credit River Anglers Assoc. among others.  https://www.oodmag.com/news/thornbury-dam-barely-averts-disaster/
1014914,LeXXington,2017-10-06 13:25:00,1928,Must have been a safety feature to open the gates.  I doubt there will be any changes other that to put up better alarms.
1014944,4x4bassin,2017-10-07 02:47:00,1025,"Have not been up in those parts for quite awhile now but did spend many days fishing that part of the river in my younger days . One thing that caught my eye right away was that the dam is controlled by what looks like an airbag system that I have never seen before . Back in the day that dams water level was controlled by stop logs which would not fail in a circumstance like this . Wonder why they went to this new system . Stop logs are definitely more labour intensive so that's probably the reason $$$ Real shame , that will cause some issues with silt/mud in the river from the dam out to the bay."

1014986,4x4bassin,2017-10-08 00:55:00,1025,"Yah , I know what the float barriers are but what looks different is the workings of the actual dam that controls the water levels. At some point not too long ago the dams water level was controlled by stop logs . Now it looks like a big airbag or something. It is definitely not a stop log operation anymore or this would not of happened ."
