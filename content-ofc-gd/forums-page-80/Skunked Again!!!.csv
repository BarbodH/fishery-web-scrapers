It had been awhile since I'd fished it, but 6 or so years ago I would catch 5-15 2-5lbs smallies in a few hours.  Launched the yak in the first pond, spent about an hour and a half and nothin. Saw a few jump but not even a strike. Tried my go to - slow rolling a white spinner bait, then switch to a buzz bait, then switched to a KVD square lipped crank... nada  So I pulled the yak out and went to the next pond. Same results. Even the beaver dams didn't produce.  Frustrating for sure!"

1014442,OhioFisherman,2017-09-28 22:45:00,6623,Did you get the cold front overnight? It's like a 15 degree difference here from yesterday.
1014448,fishing n autograph,2017-09-28 23:26:00,2540,Yeah it was 30 when I dropped the kids off at school yesterday morning. It was 20 when I picked them up and 12 this morning. Didn't get above 16 around here
1014449,manitoubass2,2017-09-28 23:28:00,11391,"I got skunked yesterday too, even though I ""thought"" we'd hammer walleye.  That's how she goes!"

Didn't get above 16 around here  Had a lot of good days fishing in crappy weather, hot or cold, but rapid changes? No, always liked a stable weather pattern."
1014455,manitoubass2,2017-09-29 00:40:00,11391,"Me too. I mean I'll fish anyways, but... 2-3 days of stable weather def beats drastic changes"
1014465,fishindevil,2017-09-29 10:15:00,6254,"cold front go with finnese presentation like verticle like a dropshot or a small swimbait or tube,and fish it slow and tight to structure they don't like to chase in a cold front but want to check it for a longer period of time,they can be coaxed into hitting ....."
