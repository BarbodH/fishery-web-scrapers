October trips make winter go faster for me.    The Geary family, 3 moose hunters and I (only fisherman on the water) will enjoy a traditional Thanksgiving meal."

1015039,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-08 16:38:00,8243,Being a dual citizen I get to have 2 Thanksgivings too. Nothing like going north this time of year if only to see the magnificent colors. Not many colours around here this year. I was told we may not get a change because of that crazy Indian Summer we had a week and a half ago.  Happy Thanksgiving to you Tennessee and to all our friends here on OFC.
1015052,DanD,2017-10-08 20:30:00,2223,"We also have two thanksgiving meals. Last night with our good friends down at the trailer park in Normandale. Tomorrow at my son's house in Warwick. My daughter in law is expecting anytime now and she still wanted to do this big meal for all of us. I'm pretty sure she wants to stay active and hopefully bring on the baby? I'm over the moon, this will be my first grandchild and it's all I can do to wait for her to hand me the child for the first time. Talk about a thanksgiving present!!!!!  Dan."

I did not diet, no appetite. I finally went to my Doc after I lost 40lbs. I went from 212 to 170, I don't remember 170, grade 10 maybe. 2CT scans with the dye thing, 2 MRI's, Ultra Sound, many blood tests. Tuesday he tells me NO CANCER. A bile duct and thyroid problem No big deal. I am thankful. But none of my cloths fit. I gained back 10 last month, the first time in my life the Doc said gain 15 pounds!!!!"
