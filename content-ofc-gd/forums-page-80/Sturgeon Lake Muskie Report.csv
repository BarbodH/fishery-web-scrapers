My total was 7 muskies, with the 2 biggest being 40'' and 41'' taken solo. My friend caught a beauty 44'' and two at 31''. The other 5 I got ranged from 29''-36''. On Saturday my friend and I represented team Canada in the annual Can-Am tournament started by the great Hank Jr. Team Canada lost by a few inches and had to provide lunch for Hank and his son. It was a great day, with great fun being had by all. Double 10 bucktails were the hot lure for me, followed by medussa's. Maybe next year Team Canada will be the victors! The highlight of my week was a 3-muskie day, with a 29'' being caught at 2:30, a 36'' being caught at 6:45 and a 40"" being caught on the first cast after releasing the 36''! Not huge fish but it sure was a blast! I'll get some pictures up once I remember how to do it lol.."
