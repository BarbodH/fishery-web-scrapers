Levi is almost 7 and loves the outdoors and Grandpa enjoys spending time with Levi and fishing too! While living in OK he was chasing snakes and all other types of wild life?? Snakes!! But anyways we hooked into a bunch of bows today and missed a bunch more(live release) they weren't looking for food and I am not a rainbow eater myself.  He is a little clip of a live release near the boat. Once Grandpa makes sure the dipsey is released he hands the rod off to little Levi.   It is great to be reminded of being a kid again, the joy of the outdoors and spending quality time with the family. "
