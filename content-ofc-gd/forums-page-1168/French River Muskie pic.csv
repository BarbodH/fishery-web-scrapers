100788,Rich Clemens,2007-08-03 21:06:00,3131,That appears to be one nice ski ... how big do you think she was ?     Congrats on the catch and release.
100802,bigcreekdad,2007-08-03 22:10:00,546,"Fish measured out at 44""....no idea of weight, but it had some shoulders and I'm guessing over 20 easy....lodge owner who saw the good pics said probably 25.  As for the f...ing camera.....it being the SECOND one I've lost this summer ( left the first one in cupholder of my driftboat and then had a nice 10 mile drive back to my cabin over some nice old bumpy roads....you're right if you are thinking I'm an idiot)....I ended up buying a reconditioned Olympus Stylus 750 over Ebay for $125 ( the 740 cost me just under $300). Olympus warranties them for 90 days......not that it matters much to me....I'll surely lose it by then."
