101232,glen,2007-08-06 00:47:00,2641,Went to lake eugenia for a few hours today.  The boat launch was packed.  When i looked out on the water i was not sure if i would launch or not.  There were a ton of boats of all kinds with the throttle pinned.  They are going to have to put some laws on this lake.  It is way too small for the size and speed of the boats.  The fishing sucked.  I caught some small ones but nothing worth taking a picture of.  Is there carp in this lake??? i think i saw one. The water was real warm and the weeds are brown.  I couldn't find any bass around these weeds. The ramp was funny on the way in cause i was by myself and people like to cut in out of turn.     It was still nice to get on the water.
