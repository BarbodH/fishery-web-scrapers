I forgot to add all the fish jumping all around me almost seemed like they were laughing.I saw a lot of big fish jumping and surfacing all around. I'm not really sure if they were bass,trout,carp,etc. I think it was a mixture. Makes me really want to give fly fishing another try. Anyway, went 4 for 7,1 lost lure and 1 hooked and now sore finger. Caught them this morning on white spinner and small red devil.Son woke up and asked if we can go again tonight so will have another report tonight. The fish in the one picture was the average size and the other pic is of my new friend who kept a close eye on me."
