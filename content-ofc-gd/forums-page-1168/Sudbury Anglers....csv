I plan to drive to some of the smaller lakes outside of Sudbury since Ramsey lake looks like it has a lot of private property surrounding the lake...  Let me know if you want to do some fishing.  I'll be bringing up the bass/pike/pickerel gear  If interested, let me know and we can exchange phone #'s to get in touch once I am up there.  Thanks! Tony"
