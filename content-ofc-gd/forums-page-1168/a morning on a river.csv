101203,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-05 19:57:00,0,Nice! I have really been enjoying all the catching up on reports since I was away. I am especially liking the videos. Keep up the good work!!  Oh and its nice to see how a pro works a shore line with a jig and pig! He is really working it at high speed and close to shore! I look forward to sharpening my skills with a jig and pig this year!

When ya have time to do that vid ?Guess I should pay more attention to my guest.LOL  Johnny Im flatered but Im far from a pro at this stuff.You got to see the little guy set into them.  Morning John,things got a little heckdict here on Saturday so the bps trip was put on the back burner.Sunday afternoon was Kempinfest day with the mrs,s,well, after  a mornings fish.  I get that from me mudders side of the family Roy. Pops side had the over hand,if ya knows what I mean.HEHEHEHE   Terry never mentioned about the carp. There were thousands of them.Surfacing and it almost looked like they were gulpping for air,looked to me like they were dying. Terry on the other hand, thought maybe it was the algy bloom they were sucking back on,but man I never seen so many in such a long stretch."
101586,Terry,2007-08-07 11:37:00,14456,"oh yeah, I forgot about the thousands of carp that were doing something weird...  I had a good time on the water thanks"
