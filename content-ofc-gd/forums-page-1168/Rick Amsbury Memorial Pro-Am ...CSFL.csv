97341,Deg,2007-07-24 00:53:00,51,"In May a post on the board announced this Pro/Am tournament and my wife thought she would surprise me by sending in my registration.  I had talked about them in the past but never entered one. She sent in the check and forms on May 22nd and waited for a reply.  Nothing came back.  We were supposed to go to Nfld in August so she really wanted to know if I was entered in order to change our plans.  After several calls to Andrew Pallotta at the CSFL office and his cell phone and leaving messages at both, she finally gave up and contacted Fleming College and spoke to a Nicole.  Nicole checked her records and said I was in the tournament and should expect a package in the mail from the CSFL.  On June 25th, when we returned from Lakair, I found a phone message telling me that all the information I needed would be sent out shortly.  Last week I still had no info and I tried several times to get Andrew Pallotta to let me know what is happening.  Not one reply from my mesages or Ruth's came from CSFL (Andrew Pallotta).  I tried Nicole at Fleming College again but she is away until later this week.  The Tournament is August 1st, Ruth booked rooms in Lindsay for 2 nights, and we know nothing about the event other than the initial announcement.  Is it still happening? Has anyone gotten a package from the CSFL ... Andrew Pallotta?  We have 4 mailing days left ... not a lot of time for errors in the mail.  Right now I am wishing we had just gone to Nfld.  If you have any info I would really appreciate your help."

97761,Craig Butler,2007-07-25 03:40:00,5,"Here's the best ways to reach Andy or Vita.......  CSFL office - 905-640-2277 E-Mail - [email protected] Andy's cell - 416-802-2277  The BEST way to do things is to reach Vita. She takes care of all the paperwork as Andy's always running around taking care of things. If you guys ever need anything beyond the norm, just drop me an email and I can call Vita at work for you. She checks the Bassmania email at night as well as the messages so if I can ever help just drop me a line.  [email protected]  Take care Craig"
97846,misfish,2007-07-25 15:41:00,29133,"Craig means what he says.I usually go through him, as it,s really hard to get ahold of Andy and Vita.Very busy people this time of year,but great people. Im sure they are not being rude by not returning your calls or messages.   Good job on getting things straight,n out Craig.  Brian"
101094,pooch,2007-08-05 02:00:00,139,"Anybody know the results? I fished it, but couldn't stick around for the dinner, and results were held secret until the dinner presention. I figure we were mid-pack, with a little over 13 lbs. We should have weighed in 15+ lbs as we had about 1.5 hrs to cull the one dink in our livewell, but to no avail.  Great event, and I had a fantastic day. My pro was exactly that, a pro. I look forward to fishing with him again. Can't wait for another pro/am. I would highly recommend it, good times.  Thanks, pooch"
