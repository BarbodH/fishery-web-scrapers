101042,danc,2007-08-04 22:11:00,4677,"About a month ago I posted a message about a Sony camera free fix for certain camera that had CCD problems. HERE'S THE POST  So I got my old Sony 717 fixed for free and was anxious to take it out once again. I hadn't used it in over a year, but this 4 year old camera has always given me consistently better pictures than the 3 or 4 cameras that I've bought since my 717. It's lacking in optical zoom by todays standards (it has 5x optical), but is better in many other ways IMHO. So Sis and I played tourists today and went for a ride to Sleeping Giant Provincial Park, just east of Thunder Bay. One of the attractions there is ""The Sea Lion"". It's a rock formation that extends out from the Giant into Lake Superior. I'd never been there before. What an incredible sight! And a picture perfect day to photograph it as well.  So, here's what I'm talking about. The Sea Lion. Its name came from the fact that the top of this rock formation once looked like the head of a lion, but part of it has since fallen into Superior, so the lion resemblance is not there now.        By the way, I used a polarizer for all of these shots. If your camera can accept add on lenses, a polarizer should be on top of your ""must have"" list. It's like a pair of fishing sunglasses for your camera.  These shots are looking down near the base of the Sea Lion.      And just a few more shots from the general area.          I think that my old Sony 717 and I are going to become really close friends once again. I'm happy that she's up and running once again."
