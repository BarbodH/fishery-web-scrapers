101124,Stern Rules,2007-08-05 06:04:00,342,"Just wondering if there are any good creeks or streams or whatever around the Cambridge, Dundas, Flamborough area that hold brookies or even any other good fish besides chubs. Some days I just wanna get out fishing and don't want to do any work for the big fish so those creeks would be fine if I knew of any. Can anyone help me out? Thanks"
