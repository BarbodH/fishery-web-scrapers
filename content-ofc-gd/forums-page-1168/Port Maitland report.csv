Hit the water by 6 and were welcomed by some serius swells from a tstorm on the soth shore. It looked like my Erie curse was on again as we lost a cannonball and could barely setup lines in the 4-5 foot swells. Eventually the swells died down and we put out our spread of 2 dipsies and 1 rigger. First fish came around 8 am in 70 feet of water 50 feet down on a dipsie and a purple worm harness. Discovered the batteries in my camera were dead, so I only have one cooler shot to offer. We went 8 for 11 with one bow , all the eyes were between 3-8 lbs, all had empty stomachs except for a large fish that had a smelt in its yap. By 12 the wind was up and we hit the ramp. All in all my best Erie result.    Special thanks to Fishmaster for the heads up.  Btw any suggestions on how to get my dipsies to release easier? Dragged a few fish today as they were hitting very light."
