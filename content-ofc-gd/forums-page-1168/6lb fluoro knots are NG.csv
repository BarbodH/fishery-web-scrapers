101030,glen,2007-08-04 21:20:00,2641,I am trying to use some 6lb seaguar fluoro leaders but i cant find a knot that will hold.  i have tried many.  Any thoughts on a good knot or anything i can try.  I tried to use a swivel between the main line and the fluoro but that knot broke too.  I was thinking maybe i should try 10lb fluoro but would 10lb fluoro be more invisible than 6lb mono???  I see no use for the 6lb fluoro the way this is going.  I need a beer.  Thanks for any help.
101031,SlowPoke,2007-08-04 21:32:00,2984,I had similar trouble once and a polymer knot solved my problem.
101032,bassjnkie,2007-08-04 21:41:00,1101," One knot and I never had a problem with it. Tripple surgeon's knot, I love this knot.  Hope this helps, Daniel OCH"
101044,glen,2007-08-04 22:21:00,2641,I tried the polymer knot and it failed.  I will try the surgeon.  Thanks.
101049,muddler,2007-08-04 22:52:00,623,"Check out this Orvis Site.  http://www.orvis.com/orvis_assets/files/index.html  I use the Orvis Tippet knot to join my mainline to a florocarbon leader and the The Orvis Hook knot for my hooks. I always step down about 2 lbs per knot. That means that if my mainline is 10 lb test and I want to use a 6lb leader, I'll tie a short 8 lb to my mainline , then the 6lb to the short piece.Tried virtually all the knot I could find years ago and these two knots come out on top. I still break off once in a while because I'm too lazy to retie after landing a fish.  You can't go wrong with these two.   Muddler"
101053,Canuck2fan,2007-08-04 22:57:00,1444,How did the knot fail? Did it break right at the tying point or further up. I had a bunch of fluoro that was no good.... It just snapped whenever you took it and gave it a tug. If you just pulled on the knot wouldn't break the tackle store said it was something to do with poor tinsile strenght....  I have not ever had good luck with 6lb fluoro either. I just use trilene XT now LOL
101055,glen,2007-08-04 23:11:00,2641,It is braking right at the knot.  I have one leader tied now with the braid knot.  I think it is a waste of time with 6lb.
101078,misfish,2007-08-05 01:01:00,29133," When you tye the knot,are you wetting it? Are you pulling both ends? Are you leaving a bit of a tag on the cut end?  Never had an issue with the polymer knot ."
101090,Tomcat,2007-08-05 01:37:00,395," Perhaps I'm misinterpreting what you posted so I'll ask ""Do you want a knot to join your main line to your flouro leader?"" If so, I'd recommend the double uni knot - see http://www.netknots.com/html/fishing_knots.html"
101098,glen,2007-08-05 02:12:00,2641,Brian i have tried everything.  Tomcat i want to join the main line to a fluoro leader.  I tried the double uni already.  I will try it again.  Maybe the 6lb fluoro is weak or something.  I got six hours of trying in so far but i am running out of beer so i may have to    give up till tomorrow.  What a pain.  I have never had any trouble with 6lb mono.  It is like it is cutting into itself.  Stupid line.
101099,Golfisher,2007-08-05 02:27:00,586,I've been using Seaguar knot for 8 lb line and haven't had any problem:  Seaguar Knot
101109,bassboy,2007-08-05 03:11:00,161,"I have been using 6lb flouro for all this year so far and have tied a number of knots with no issues. Clinch knot, uni knot and a trilene knot all seemed to work. However, I did have this problem with some 12lb spiderwire mono.....and everything broke. I summoned it to a bad spool of line. In fact the line never made it to water. A few years ago I had a similar problem with some Gold Stren I was trying for the first time. I have not used any Stren product since then.....  Perhaps you got a bad batch/old spool of line?   Bill"
101141,Jackel,2007-08-05 11:56:00,25,Like Misfish said.  You must wet the line first.  Jackel
101148,bigcreekdad,2007-08-05 12:29:00,546,"I've been using successfully a Crawford knot for over 30 years......from muskies to #18 flies on a 6x floro tippet. I found the knot in a book....""Lunkers Love Nightcrawlers"".....easy to tie, and quite strong.....always test first.....if it slips a bit, retie.....but if seated properly you will love it."
101180,misfish,2007-08-05 16:28:00,29133," When you uniknot,put the whole knot area in yer mouth and pull both ends.Just dont catch yer toung in the knot.LOL  I used 8 pound CFX like I said last week,direct to the braid.Pulled fish out of weeds and all,no issues. Even yanked a few today on the river with Terry.Same lead and all,never changed up."
