I spent the last few days of the week fishing Lake Ontario in preparation for the 2007 Tightline Salmon Shootout on Saturday at Bluffers Park. The fishing was pretty good all week, with good weather and lots of good mature fish to be found. I was fortunate enough this week to have my Step Grandfather, Marty come out one evening for some fishing. At 83 years old Marty was so happy to be out it brought back many decades of memories for him. Marty used to fish the lake lots from the early 60s to early 90s.  We set our lines and it did not take long for Marty to get a taste of the salmon action again. Here is a picture of Marty with his first salmon on.    A nice mature fish for Marty, “Look at that smile”    We put two more nice mature kings in the boat and Marty was pretty worn out      The key to our success was using Dipsy  Divers and A-tom-mik flies.  Friday I had to get out again and do some more pre fishing for the big day on Saturday. I ended up fishing on my own for a few hours and checking a bunch of locations. Here is a couple of nice matures that I boated on my own.  A-tom-mik tournament series flies. #55 Purple Passion       There is still three weeks left in the Great Ontario Salmon derby so if anyone wants to test there luck and try winning a boat come on out for a great day of fishing.
