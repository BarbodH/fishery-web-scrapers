Special thanks to all the sponsors of the event as well. The 2007 Tightlines Shootout was a tremendous success with a very good field of competitive anglers from Ontario and United States. The field was full this year with 40 competing for a first prize of $10,000. Congratulations to Team Hot Rods, Matt and Eric Santoro for defending the title for the second year in a row. Congratulations as well to team Maestro with Drew Primose and Mike Attard coming in second.  The weather was perfect and fishing was tough with almost half the field struggling to get a full 6 fish box. I had a great day and a ton of fun and I am looking forward to next year already.
