101428,codered,2007-08-06 23:23:00,123,I have been told that to charge a deep cycle batterie  it  should be done on 2 amp cycle to charge it properly .. I have been given a new batterie charger  from a friend and it doesnt have the option to charge it at  2 amp  only  10 .. Does anybody know if charging  on 2 amp  vs 10 will make a difference? I dont know much about batteries  any help would be great... Thx happy fishing...

101503,Tomcat,2007-08-07 01:58:00,395,"The rate at which you charge a deep cycle battery depends on what type of deep cycle battery you're charging. Gel cell deep cycle batteries are best charged at low amps (i.e. 2 amps). However, Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) deep cycle batteries can be charged at higher rates. Flooded batteries (wet cell) are different again. Best advice would be to check the specifications for the battery you have and follow the charging instructions provided."
101524,joonmoon,2007-08-07 02:28:00,528,I have 2 gel batteries I use for my electric trolling motor only. They were 1 year old and used on a scooter when I got them. By charging them on a slow trickle charge of 2 amps they have lasted me several years. The trick is to totally drain them before charging or they will pick up a memory and only allow so much charge. Check out the type of battery you have and go by the manufacturers stats for charging it. Hope this helps good luck.
