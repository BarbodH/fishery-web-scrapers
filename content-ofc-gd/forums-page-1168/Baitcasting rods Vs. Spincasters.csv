I picked up a tiny 25 dollar  5 foot ugly stik spincasting combo at Walmart this morning, tossed the spincasting reel aside and put my baitcaster on there.  It looks like it should be a pretty sweet combo for casting light lures and panfishing, maybe the odd small bass thrown in there. Looks like you could cast with it all day with absolutely no arm fatigue either. Anyone foresee any problems? Actually kind of a nice change from the 7 and a half foot musky rod."

When you're using a spinning rod with the eyes UP you're pulling against it the opposite way it was meant to bend... but a spincasting rod is built the same as baitcasting rods, so you should be ok if it is a spincasting rod and not a spinning rod."
