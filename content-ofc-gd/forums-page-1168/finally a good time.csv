I ended up going 9 for 13 and he went 3 for 8. All smallmouths and all caught on spinners. The fish in the pic is about the average size we caught.Nothing huge but nothing to complain about. While out we also saw a guy catch a nice trout and a huge smallie. Fish were hungry for sure. We left at about 8:00 when we got attacked by little moths. On the funny side of things my son ended up with a crayfish in his boot and also managed to catch a face cloth that put up an amazing fight,lol."
