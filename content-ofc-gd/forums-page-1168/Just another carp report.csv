After about 2 hours of fishing, she calls me and tells me she has a migraine and that i have to go and get her from work. I did manage to hook into some fish, went 3/5. Ended up catching a nice size smallmouth on corn and lost couple suckers using worms. I think they were suckers, there were bunches of them and were all shinning silver. Here are pics of the fish that i caught   "

99830,Marko,2007-08-01 15:12:00,854,"The reel is pretty good. I like it cuz the drag is at the bottom part of it, its easier to adjust it when u have a big fish peeling your line out.  Fish were caught at St Marys again. Fairly close to London, just south of  Stratford."
99837,Victor,2007-08-01 15:35:00,1609,good to see a carp report this time of the year! great fights on light gear!
101501,Rage,2007-08-07 01:54:00,8,"From what i see, as far as were the carp are laying you must be a novice carp angler. A seasoned carp angler would never subject carp to concrete which i belive it is. Putting them on  soil that has heavy grass is ok but not just on concrete, Carp thrashing around like they do on a hard surface such as concrete can do serious injury to there insides. A padded weigh sling mat combination should be an item on your list of gear to purchase if you continue to carp angle. Even a plastic babies crib mattres would make a great un-hooking mat. They may only be CARP but they deserve respect. I am a seasoned carp angler and dont get me wrong i am not giving you criticism just pointing out how i feel about placing carp on hard surfaces that can cause them harm and injury. You do have a nice catch there and hope you catch many more.  Cheers and Tightlines.  Rodpody..."
