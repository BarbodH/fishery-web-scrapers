101607,misfish,2007-08-07 13:09:00,29133,I would say they might of  came from Erie.This the reason for not dumping.You dont know where they came from.
49721,Viscount,2007-03-20 20:03:00,52,I only use minnows when i'm ice fishing.
49722,Fishmaster,2007-03-20 20:05:00,920,Viscount do you fish Lake Erie for perch in the spring and summer ...minnows are the best bait ...
49777,Viscount,2007-03-20 21:57:00,52,No i've never tried Erie. I'm in Sudbury. I'll see if I can update my profile to display that. I havent been on here much since the board switched to this format. thanks for the tip though!
49785,GbayGiant,2007-03-20 22:16:00,1780,I freez'm they work just as good dead in a lot of presentations.
49794,huntervasili,2007-03-20 22:56:00,1604,I keep my leftovers alive in the tank usually... but usually I get enough fish to eat up all my minnows
49863,OhioFisherman,2007-03-21 01:29:00,6623,"Trap, my last time up there was 1988 or 89 I believe the laws were different then. I emailed the Ministry a couple years ago and got answer, they said the bait dealers lead the push to ban non-residents from trapping their own.  LOL I like fishing for them with a hook better any way, I don`t use much small bait."
49866,Rattletrap2,2007-03-21 01:31:00,1652,"B, I have only ever used them for ice fishing. The left overs are given away to others. On Island lake, I take them back to the folks operating the bait concession. They can re-sell them.  If I used live bait in the soft water season, it would be worms or Leeches...if anything at all."
49871,Frank,2007-03-21 01:42:00,74,"I rely on minnows for 95% of my fishing outings, some would say ""go and catch your own"", in which i do, but when I am just getting off of work, I do not have time to go find a school of minnows to lure into my trap, so I go and support the local neighbourhood bait shop and buy them.   Just for the record since it wasn't on the poll, I also use minnows for catfish"
50322,cisco,2007-03-22 01:52:00,597,"Since folks who don't use internet and or have language barriers to the poll and also since folks who use or don't use minnows may or may not respond to the poll.... and a buncha other professional social-science aspects, the poll is not reliable. Not to mention the sample size.....  DON'T take a ""37% use minnows"" to MNR since the results may be used to close down the bait industry as opposed to support it. If you do, then make sure you teel em the sample was from internet users numbering.... what, 20 to 50 OFC respondents?!?!  The survey/poll is not scientifically rigorous...... I'll translate...... it's CRAP!  It's meaningless except to support a hidden agenda ( see my post on the baitharvester help thread.  I was afraid someone was going to trundle off with the meaningless results only to give MNR ammo to do as they please. So for the record, lettem contact me if they wish to use this data to support baitfish as bait closure. SHEESH!  I expect lottsa attacks now from the peanut gallery, but the intelligent among the members here understand what I've stated here. LOL!"
50398,pikehunter,2007-03-22 09:41:00,1659,"I use minnows, not all the time but on occasion.  The left overs go to the roadside or in some cases I have returned the live ones to the shop where I bought them. Whether the owner has put them into a separate tank to observe them for later resale or put them aside to return them to their original home is his choice. I have kept them alive for the next day. I tried to keep them for future trips a week or so later but discovered that it wasn't worth my while.  Wayne is right, it is illegal to dump live minnows into a different body of water, a very important rule that I don't think many have noticed."
50420,misfish,2007-03-22 12:16:00,29133,You calling my poll CRAP...........................................
50424,cisco,2007-03-22 12:32:00,597,Well. maybe not from an East Coast scientist. Heartfelt apologies Dr. Brian.
50437,mrpike,2007-03-22 13:24:00,151,I take them back to my  small pond  and feed them to the bass .  AND I catch them in the river that flows in to the lake that I am on.  When the bass are bigger then 6 inches I let the BASS go back in the lake. I am really not a bass fisher men  I like lake trout pike rainbow walleyes and after LAKAIR  musky I HOPE.  Bass is really not my thing . They are just to easy to catch.
50441,misfish,2007-03-22 13:31:00,29133," Thats ok,you,ll be at the back of the boat when I take off.LOL"
100657,Tacklebuster,2007-08-03 15:55:00,303,"I only use minnows for crappy fishing, which is only once or twice a year, and any leftovers I give to whoever is still fishing when I leave, and never had anyone turn down free bait either."
100670,snag,2007-08-03 16:43:00,1932,I try to find someone to give them too or return them to the vendor if it's convenient (wish they were refundable!)
100727,misfish,2007-08-03 19:30:00,29133,I seen this thread seen MISFISH was the poster.took me back and then remembered this poll.LOL  Nice to see people looking back.
100817,Greencoachdog,2007-08-03 22:55:00,8163," Spray some Raid up yer butt Bubba!!!... it might kill that bug!   I'm not going to lie, I turn mine back into the lake if I don't find someone to give them to... it gives the Crappie something to do when I'm not around  I use minnows for Crappie and Catfish, and would use them for Wall-ice... if I could get Kevin to stock them in June  A 6 hook Sabiki Rig loaded with live minnows (in the U.S... 4 hooks in Canuckia) is D-E-A-D-L-Y!!!"
100837,misfish,2007-08-03 23:31:00,29133," R O T F L M A O  Minnows for catfish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
100848,Greencoachdog,2007-08-03 23:58:00,8163,"  Go ahead and ""yuck it up"" Brian!!!  ... but both of these cats were caught on 2 inch live Shiners!  "
101137,pikehunter,2007-08-05 11:33:00,1659," YEP! You mean to say you haven't had a cat take a minnow?  I have caught far to many cats this spring on live minnows, trolling spoons and spinners. You should give it a try. Kind of fun   except when the cat gets his pectorals tangled up in the net and the trebles of your favourite Mepps through the netting so bad that I had to cut up the net so the big cat could live.  Just like in GCD's pictures, cats do love minnows. I know I was surprised years ago the first time I got one this way. So much for them being bottom feeders eating rotting stuff."
101140,Rizzo,2007-08-05 11:52:00,4754,"Take em home for the kids to play with.  Then when the minnows ""get tired"", daddy puts them in the garden so they can have a ""dirt nap"""
101182,misfish,2007-08-05 16:34:00,29133,"Got one today while flipp,n a jig guess they will bite anything.LOL  I use to catch the whiskers on frogs.Really pee,ed me off,they were for bass and real expensive."
101278,OhioFisherman,2007-08-06 12:12:00,6623,"LOL, fish eat fish, about the only thing I haven`t caught on minnows were shad and suckers and other minnows. We would even get a carp once in a while years ago fishing for crappie."
101494,007,2007-08-07 01:42:00,537,When I went ice fishing on Simcoe I was told that the minnows were from Simcoe so at the end of the day I returned them to the lake - was that ok?
49615,misfish,2007-03-20 17:10:00,29133,Re did the poll.  Lets try it again.
49617,misfish,2007-03-20 17:12:00,29133,That looks better.
49619,Terry,2007-03-20 17:13:00,14456,dang i use them for walleye...errr...pickeral
49623,charlesn,2007-03-20 17:17:00,551,"If you just pick ""No"" it crashes and tells you that you do not know how to use this feature.  lol  You apparently need to make other choices, but if your answer is ""No"" it doesn't make sense to pick any of the other options.  Charles"
49625,OhioFisherman,2007-03-20 17:18:00,6623,"LOL my answer was to complicated. In canada I bought them from local bait stores or caught them myself from the body of water I was fishing. I did release them into the body of water I was fishing.  I don`t fish for salmon, steelhead are a side effect most of the time. I have used live minnows for just about everything, but not often for almost 20 years."
49631,misfish,2007-03-20 17:24:00,29133," Im no computer geek,someone fix that.  Charles you mean you dont have a little live well stashed away on that rocket of yers.How do you catch yer bass?L M A O L O L"
49636,charlesn,2007-03-20 17:42:00,551,"lol, c'mon Brian, you fished with me...  You should know better...  Besides, leeches last longer...  lol  Charles"
49637,bigfish1965,2007-03-20 17:42:00,3382,Now it will work...you set up a string of polls that needed each other to work properly. Someone only selecting 'No' gave them no other reason to participate and that crashed the logic. By adding 'I don't use bait' allowed them to participate in all the polls as needed.
49639,outdoorguy61,2007-03-20 17:50:00,220,"I know a lot of people that like to keep them in either aquariums or priveate ponds, etc. I tryed to aswer but it would not allow me saying some error or something occurred.  outdoorguy61"
49643,Fishmaster,2007-03-20 17:58:00,920,i liked the old poll better ....this is way to confusing for people ..
49644,irishfield,2007-03-20 18:00:00,26272,"NEVER back in the lake...as you don't know where they came from if you bought them...and why it's ILLEGAL to dump bait in the lake. Even when I catch my own minnows at the lake, if I'm done fishing they go in Leah's garden in front of the cottage."
49645,bigfish1965,2007-03-20 18:00:00,3382,The other poll didn't work. This one works. This is therefore less confusing.
49654,Fishmaster,2007-03-20 18:17:00,920,Ok Rick how can we tell how many people use live bait..i would like to copy this and take it to the next Bait meeting and it's alote easyer if it shows how many people use live bait and how many don't ...
49655,charlesn,2007-03-20 18:20:00,551,"Fishmaster,  So far of the people that responded (16), 3 have responded that they don't use minnows.  So you have a general idea of the percentage.  Of course, the title of the poll makes it less likely that non-live bait users will bother to participate in the poll, but you should get a general idea for your meeting.  Good luck, Charles"
49656,irishfield,2007-03-20 18:20:00,26272,"What Charles said...subtract the ""I don't use"" from the total votes count = number that use bait"
49657,Roy,2007-03-20 18:20:00,13728,37%
49659,Fishmaster,2007-03-20 18:22:00,920,Got it now thanks ..
49662,Guest mistyriver1,2007-03-20 18:26:00,0,"Dump em at the side of the road or try and find someone to give em to.  Brian, it didn't specify but I picked more than one fish (walleye and perch) if I do use minnows (getting less and less all the time)."
49666,Garyv,2007-03-20 18:27:00,547,"One the question of left over minnows, although I would not change the poll a third time  the first answer of throw them back into the lake doesn't allow for self trapped or purchased. Since we trap 95% of all our own minnows from the body of water we are fishing, yes I throw them back into the lake.  That being said if I purchased them from a dealer any remaining go on my bird feeder or are simply discarded in the bush...never in the lake."
49675,ccmtcanada,2007-03-20 18:50:00,7971,"Bly and I rarely use minnows...truth be known, we have never caught anything with them!  We could be fishing with 6 other ppl, all using minnows fishing for small walleye...others are catching them and not even a sniff for us.  We also used them ice fishing.....again nada!!  We are minnow inept I think...or we have the vocal ones...telling the bigger fish to stay away...haha.  We do well catching walleye with artificials...mostly crankbaits, so we'll continue to use those I think."
49676,john vail,2007-03-20 18:52:00,67,"I keep the leftovers in my shad tank, still have them alive from the fall"
49679,misfish,2007-03-20 19:00:00,29133,"Fish master I hope this poll does help you out.  Gary,if I buy them local it dosent really mean they are from Simcoe as there has been years the locals will go to Erie to get them.  We have had good runs here ,the past few years."
49682,grt1,2007-03-20 19:12:00,638,"although I voted that I dumped them in the lake, it was the closest thing to what I do, because I keep them in my minnow bucket for use the next day when I return to my fishing adventures. Maybe there should be a selection that allows for keeping them alive for future use."
49684,misfish,2007-03-20 19:14:00,29133,Theres so much you can do with a poll.LOL  Hows the fishing these days on Gullrock grt1? Use to stay at the Duck Rock for the deer hunt.Did very well there for or feeds of panfish.
49702,trapshooter,2007-03-20 19:40:00,1234," Paul, FYI, it is illegal for non residents to trap minnows in Ont.  Not attacking you here, just wanted to let you and other non residents know to avoid possible trouble down the road.  Furthermore, residents are only permittied to possess 10 dozen minnows per valid licence at any time.  Your traps must also be labeled with your name.  Something to think about."
