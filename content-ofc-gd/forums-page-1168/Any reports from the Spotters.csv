101043,wmshaw,2007-08-04 22:16:00,42,"Hey Brian,  I was a spotter on one of the boats today and I must say that I really did not learn anything. The guys had everything pre-rigged and fished away.  My team only had 4 fish on and landed only three.  If you just want to be on a boat, its okay, but I did not find it educational.  The good news is that the guy I was the spotter for (pre-tourey)  is going to take me fishing tomorrow.  The other nice thing about the tourney is that I met a few guys who have boats and have invited me to fish with them as well.  I was very lucky on the prize table draw and managed to get a sweet Shimano Tekota 700 as a prize.  Overall, I had a good time.  Bill"

The crew I was with were very knowledgeable, friendly and very humorous. I would strongly recommend being an observer, especially if you are new to this type of fishing. Thanks Al (Spoonman) for inviting me and showing me around yesterday - a first rate guy indeed!"
