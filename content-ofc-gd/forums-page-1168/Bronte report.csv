Too late too arrange a partner hook up so it was just me and the dog.  The parking set up right now with all the boats is a bit odd but guess its crowd control.  I set out at 6am staring at 80F and heading out into the 150+ mark the fish were far and few between close in all the fish were out in the deep water.  Lots and lots of boats out fishing. Even with so much water I had one guy in a White Lowen that not only cut me off as I had the right of way, but steared at me forceing me to do a hard turn. Yep tangleing my lines.  In the 200f mark the rigger went off wow, thought I had a monster on then too my surprise it was a double hookup. A large bow on the slider and a shaker on the bottom.  This is the second time it happend too me  Always a fun netting job     Once the wind picked up and the heat started I reset the lines and started trolling in. I am sure all the spoon pullers have done this, you reset a rod,  troll for an hour then bring up your line to find a shaker on it.. Dolt  how long has it been attached  Anyway 2 nice footballs for the BBQ  "

101251,tbayboy,2007-08-06 03:09:00,1497,Thats two reports today of guys in boats not paying attention and messing with lines.  Glad to see you managed to pull through with a nice fish and a couple shakers for the dinner table.
