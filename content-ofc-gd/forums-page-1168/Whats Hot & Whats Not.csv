101002,goby,2007-08-04 18:43:00,18,Well in a weeks time I'll be sitting around a Muskoka lake itching to get out on the water that I haven't been on scince last year. Last year I didn't land as many as previous years but the size of fish was  a great improvement. I was hoping some of you could tell me what are some of the hot lures and colours this year. One of my all time favorites has to be the jitterbug at dusk.
101006,banger,2007-08-04 19:03:00,95,"The best lure to use for any Lake, is what's naturally eaten by the game fish in the lake. Some lakes with rock bottoms.Tube jigs/crayfish platics work great on..And you could toss all kinds of crank baits and get nothing.Other lakes with deep water,might have shad for bait fish.In these Lakes, crank baits in certain times of year, can be great!.   It really depends on the bottom of the lake.The depth of the Lake.Water clairity & color.Veg/cover grown on the bottom.All this info, will tell you what the Game fish are eating.   I could'nt really tell you what to use.That's is hot, right now.Keep your eyes open,while in the boat. And pick your lure based on the info.    Match the hatch."
