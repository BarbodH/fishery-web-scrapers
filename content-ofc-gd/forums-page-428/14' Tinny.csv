677267,Tootsie II,2012-03-18 16:12:00,162,"I went with the 14' wide body Naden a few years ago and love it. Mine just flies on calm water and takes waves well in rougher swells. I had bought a new 30 hp Johnson 2 years prior to that, so I had to stick with the 15"" transom. If I was buying new, I would definitely go 20"" and long shaft motor. Picked mine up for a real good price at the end of the season in Coldwater. The Naden is rated for 35 hp but be careful if you go 4 stroke, as a lot of these hp ratings were done on the basis of 2 strokes which can be up to 40 lbs lighter. Depending on which of my three annual fishing trips we're on, it either rides on its own trailer or on a rack that I have built over my off-road pop-up tent trailer."
677315,curryale,2012-03-18 20:15:00,26, I have spent a lot of time in the Yukon 15 (15 inch transom) as a good friend of mine has one.  He and I fished out of it 10 days straight a couple of years ago without complaint.  It has a lot of positives in my view - it is light and pretty stable.  15 horsepower moves it along quickly.  Perfect boat for a lot of those smaller lakes up your way.  Easy to get into tight spaces.  From a negative perspective the gauge of aluminum is pretty light.   It was trailered a few times without a transom saver (and a motor on it).  That resulted in the transom having to be replaced.   If I were to buy one I might consider getting one a bit heavier with thicker aluminum.
677321,wormdunker,2012-03-18 21:12:00,1711,"Thanx for all your replies.  I'm presently PM Irishfield for a quote on the Naden.  His guy is going to contact me.  I emailed Polar Craft 1 week ago, they have yet to reply.  Princecraft & Alumacraft R .066 guage aluminum, Naden is .072, also 4"" wider.    Naden has 5 keel strips which makes it a very stable boat.  Not sure # of keel strips on the Prince, but I will find out."
677374,Roe Bag,2012-03-18 23:24:00,246,"I have a 14' Misty River. It weighs 315 lbs. Wide and deep and rated for up to 30 hp. When I bought it new I went with a 15 hp four stroke. Two guys, battery, electric trolling motor, all safety eqipment and our gear and it ran out at 20 mph. Just me and my gear, 23 mph. Three guys and gear and the top speed dropped down to around 15 mph. I put a 25 four stoke on it last year and with three in the boat it runs out a 25 mph. Me alone and it's up to 28 mph. With two it barely falls off at all.  20 inch transom is the way to go. Fast stops with a 15"" and you'll have water sloshing in over the back of the boat. Especially when you are alone because all the weight is in the back end. A splash well is a plus. Maxing out the horsepower will get you to shore a lot quicker if there's a storm brewin. My last boat was a Mirrocraft Deep Fisherman with a 25 Johnson on it. In any kind of rough water, the poor slob running the motor (me) got drenched because there was no splash rail to deflect the water away from the sides of the boat. Hull design that incorporates a slash rail is a must for me. My buddy has a Lund 14' with a 25 on it and it's a real nice soft dry ride. Another buddy has a Sylvan. He's always wet in rough water and that thing just pounds going through the waves. He gets mad when I tell him it's like putting an outboard on an old bath tub. It doesn't cut the water at all. It plows. Hard to imagine there could be so much difference in a 14' tinny but believe me there is. Good luck."

677977,irishfield,2012-03-20 22:11:00,26272,"Wormdunker.. spent a long time yaking with Andre and we've decided it's best to let our dealers do their thing and to not start undercutting them by selling directly.  That said.. Temagami Marine is a dealer and if you mention my name the pencil might get sharpened a bit there, but I bet the same thing can happen through Geisler Marine in Powassan as well. Which ever Naden dealer is the closest to the purchaser just makes it easiest for the buyer. I'll send you a PM and I'm waiting for a list of current dealers that are on board with the new Naden Boat."
678023,Blue Lk,2012-03-21 00:22:00,337," If they build them like they did in Vermilion Bay,you can't go wrong. In this neck of the woods,you see a Naden in about every second yard."

677087,wormdunker,2012-03-17 21:54:00,1711,"I'm looking to purchase a new 14' tinny for the small lakes I fish north of Sudbury.  I'm looking at the Princecraft Yukon 15.  It's 14'3"" length with a 15"" transom.  Also available is the Yukon 20 (14'3"", 20"" transom).  Both have 68"" beam.  What R your thoughts on the short shaft versus the long shaft?  Also motor size?  Max HP rating is 25HP.  This sounds like alot of motor for a 14'.  I'm leaning toward a 15HP Merc 4 stroke.  Or should I move up to the 20 HP?  Salesman states going from 15 HP - 20 HP is only a difference of 2-3 mph.  Your comments are welcome.  Does anybody own this particular boat?  I would appreciate your input.  I also looked at the Alumacraft.  Similar specs to the Princecraft.  Alumacraft's max HP rating is 20 HP.  Weight of both is only a 5 lb difference.  Please give me your thoughts.  Thanx"
677088,davey buoy,2012-03-17 22:10:00,5505," I don't know the boats,but from what I've heard is if possible always go to max HP. You'll never no when you have to get to shore in a hurry or if you add more people with added weight at least you can get on plane."
677089,Old Man,2012-03-17 22:13:00,822,"I don't think you can go wrong with either brand. As far as the HP question, you said this rig was for fishing small lakes. I personally would stick with the 15 hp, it's not like your going to be traveling long distances on these lakes. Around here, launching on some of our small lakes, the lighter the rig the better. IMHO"
677091,trevy727,2012-03-17 22:18:00,351,"Personally, I would go with the 20"" transom and 20- 25HP motor. I have a 15"" transom and was considering building it up and getting a long shaft, but instead, im buying a new boat. When you troll backwards into the wind, the lower transom takes on water. Even in small lakes. My boat was 14.5 with a 20HP. 37klms/ hour maxed out at."
677096,irishfield,2012-03-17 22:46:00,26272,Buy a new Naden out of Temagami Boat Manufacturing Inc. I need to see some returns....   PM me if you want a quote.  Heaviest 14'r is 265lbs  http://www.nadenboats.ca/models-canadianlaker.html  The 14' Fisherman is 240 lbs  http://www.nadenboats.ca/models-fisherman.html  The light fisherman is only 160lbs.  http://www.nadenboats.ca/models-lightfisherman.html
677097,mercman,2012-03-17 22:48:00,7054,"its a wide boat, go with Max HP. It also has a splash well, so waves are not a problem."
677100,wormdunker,2012-03-17 22:52:00,1711,"Sorry I lied!!  The 14' Princecraft is 30lbs (not 5lbs as stated above) heavier than the 14' Alumacraft with 20"" transom.  Trevy- At that speed how many guys & gear in the boat?  What is the weight of your boat?  I'm attempting to get this info from the dealers but not getting too far.  The 1 dealer says if I'm not happy with the 20 HP bring it back he'll upgrade for me.  Problem is if I go 25HP I would want electric start which is an additional $1,700.00 over the 20 HP pull start.  Thanx for your replies."
677103,davey buoy,2012-03-17 23:00:00,5505,Apparently the newer motors are far easier to pull then the old ones. And for 5 extra horses it can't be two much harder than a 20hp.Remember down the road the electric will get more money than the pull if you plan to sell.
677108,Ralph Field,2012-03-17 23:18:00,1018,"I had a 25 Johnson and once I got it started in the morning it would start on the first pull the rest of the day. I had an electric start for the motor, but never felt the need to install it. Hope you get a lot of enjoyment from your new boat."
677112,trevy727,2012-03-17 23:26:00,351,"  Just 2 people in the boat with all the safety gear, 8 rods and reels, 2 big tackle bags, 1 battery, electric transom mount 55lb minn Kota. I'm not sure the weight of my boat but it's a 1993 Grumman with a 93 Yamaha 20HP."

677122,danbouck,2012-03-17 23:56:00,4380,"To answer your questions, it all depends on the lakes. Do they get rough? How far will you be from shore? I had a 9.9 on my 14.5' and it ran good."
677124,glen,2012-03-18 00:01:00,2641,"Go 20"" then with a 15hp.  If you are not traveling more then 3-4 miles to fish then it will get you there."
677126,wormdunker,2012-03-18 00:04:00,1711,"Dan - small lakes, largest chop I was in was 8 - 12"".  Not planning on using it on Nipissing or Simcoe."

677184,Dabluz,2012-03-18 02:39:00,701,"  There are a lot of variables that you have not mentioned.  Do you usually fish alone?  If not, how many will usually fish with you?  Small lakes with a maximum of 5 km in length?  Can you backup right into the water or do you have to drag your boat to get to water?  I have a 14 foot Espadon Cartopper (Princecraft).  I guess if I really had to, I could carry it on my back.  I can put it on the roof of my van if I have to however, I have a small homemade trailer and I don't even need to use a winch to get it on the trailer even if the trailer is not in the water.  I usually fish alone and with my 7.5 h.p. Evinrude, it goes on plane and travels at 30 km/h with all of my equipment on board including big battery and electric motor.  It's stable enough to fish standing but I have a good high back seat so I am already high enough for comfortable fishing.  I fish a some lakes where I cannot back the trailer into the water but it's just a short drag to the water's edge.  I often carry the Evinrude inside my van but on short trips where there are ramps, I leave the motor on the transom.  As you can see, a 14 cartopper is just fine for me.  I also have a 9.9 Chrysler that I will be trying out this year to see if it is better when I have a 2 nd person with me.  I never travel very far on the water anyway.  I guess I use up no more than 60 to 100 liters of gas and I do a lot of fishing during a year.  If I did not fish alone so often, I would probably buy a 15 foot boat or a 14 foot jumbo and use a larger motor and then use my 14 foot Sportspal for the small lakes without boat ramps.  If I was sure to always have 2 or 3 fishermen, I would get a 16 foot jumbo with a 25 to 40 h.p."
