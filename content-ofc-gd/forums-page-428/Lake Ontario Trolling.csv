678602,rock34,2012-03-22 20:36:00,215,Where do you launch out of Greg? Im putting in at Port Dalhousie this year for the first time.  Im looking forward to it.

678638,Pikeslayer,2012-03-22 22:13:00,1443,"Nice shooting there Greg.   PD is one of the first hot spots on the lake for early kings, but typically mid to late April. Who knows with the weather this year? As far as the browns for this weekend, with the easterlies moving in tomorrow, the warmer shore water will be blown back farther of shore. Not sure if I'd even want to be on the big lake this weekend (as Grimace has already mentioned)."
