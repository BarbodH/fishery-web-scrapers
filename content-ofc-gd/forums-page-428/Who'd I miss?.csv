678380,Big Cliff,2012-03-22 01:54:00,6899,"Can you believe it?  They sent my income tax return form back to me!  In response to question # 4, ""Do you have any dependants?"" I replied - ""2.1 million illegal immigrants, 1.1 million crack heads, 4.4 million unemployable people, 901 thousand people in over 85 prisons, and 650 idiots in Parliament.  Apparently, this was NOT an acceptable answer.  Who the hell did I miss?"

678429,Billy Bob,2012-03-22 11:51:00,5865, NOW NOW.....we old farts payed into those pension plans....unlike Cliff's dependants......  Speaking of having them send it back to you.....I had that happen one year because the form I downloaded off the IRS website had the wrong date at the top of the page....it was the year before's form that was EXACTLY the same as the current year except it said 2007 instead of 2008....
