678153,COUNTRYBOY,2012-03-21 13:54:00,130,"  THAT SURE IS A HARD JOURNEY, I WONDER IF THEY FEEL PAIN"
678184,GbayGiant,2012-03-21 15:57:00,1780,"  Oh Yes. OF COURSE THEY DO. Everytime they eat another fish and get the sharp pointy fins into them. They say ouch! Then they spit it out, starve and die.   "
678395,Paulus,2012-03-22 02:26:00,522, wow! that's awesome footage! Thanks for sharing
678406,Kingsalmon,2012-03-22 02:59:00,107,"I spent a lot of time there at the dam when I went to school there in the 80's. I can tell you that I've never seen that many fish jumping at the same time even when 15000+ went thru the ladder.  Makes you wonder how many get left behind that cannot find the ladder.  I was sure that they would have blew out that dam since it is old, but with todays red tape, it is no surprise that it is still there.  I'll bet that if they got rid of that dam, the runs would increase even more.   It really serves no purpose because lampreys cannot get over the rapids and falls down at the town."
678407,chessy,2012-03-22 03:06:00,610, we have gotten lamprey at the ladder .. and have peeled lampreys off fish before we sample them
678408,BillM,2012-03-22 03:11:00,17367,"Wow, talk about loaded!  It's too bad the ladder didn't take up a bigger section of the dam...  Some of those fish are just going to jump and jump and get nowhere."
678411,chessy,2012-03-22 03:29:00,610, the water is high so they will jump at all locations .. we have removed a log from the ladder and there is more flow going out the entrance to draw fish over .. if the mnr would replace the gabian baskets at the other side of the river .. it would direct the water flow towards the entrance of the ladder
678412,Kingsalmon,2012-03-22 03:35:00,107," That would be the only way they could get over that first set of falls in town, hitchhiking on salmon or trout."
678439,BillM,2012-03-22 12:14:00,17367, Let's hope they do that..
678443,Richard S.,2012-03-22 12:29:00,75,What's sad is the fish that don't find the entrance to the ladder will jump and jump get tired and drop back to spawn below the dam then get slaughtered on opener. Kinda reminds me of the opener in 98 when only 3500 fish made it through the ladder by opening day what a mess that was.  Rich.
678450,BillM,2012-03-22 12:54:00,17367,Doesn't seem like it would take much for the MNR (or other groups) to give those fish a helping hand over the dam...
678459,chessy,2012-03-22 13:30:00,610," we have asked to sand bag the other side of the dam, they will not give us permission to do so"
678461,chessy,2012-03-22 13:32:00,610," Yes and i think that is the year that my hatred for the ofah came about, we wanted to put a temp sanctuaries on parts of the river so no fishing could be done the ofah said not a chance that is when our mayor stepped in and said fine there will be no trespassing signs and no fishing rods in a park ect ect.. the ofah then allowed the sanctuaries to go in .."
678477,BillM,2012-03-22 14:01:00,17367, Pretty sad when it wouldn't cost them a dime or even their time.
