678594,troutologist,2012-03-22 20:19:00,951,Have any of you fine folks been here and tried the fishing?  I have found a limited amount of info online but thought I would mine OFC for some personal experience.  Thanks
678604,trevy727,2012-03-22 20:40:00,351,"Yeah, I went fishing down there. Just booked it through the resort when we got there. 4 of us went and I think it was $120/ person or / couple. I can't remember. It was a very good time. Everyone caught barracuda except me.  I caught a 15-18lb grouper. I think we were out for about 5 hrs. 4hrs fishing and an hour traveling in the boat."

We would take bikes or rent scooters and fish all the bridges and flats along the road.  Caught snappers, jacks, tons of great fis[attachment.  Ask chef for uncooked shrimp, and bring spider wire to wrap shrimp so the smaller fish don't steal it.	Heres a few pics of roadside fishing, hope the work.  My wife had a great fish on until a cuda grabbed it!  "

678737,troutologist,2012-03-23 02:58:00,951,Awesome...thanks! Hoping to be able to get out early most mornings while the missus is sleeping.  Looks like I'm going to have to brush up on my tropical fish ID skills!

678748,Sinker,2012-03-23 03:42:00,8692,"   I also stayed down there, at the Melia, and fished from a bike off the bridges. We had lots of fun doing that. Some neat fish to be caught for sure!  Bring a med heavy spin, lots of egg weights of varying sizes and LOTS of hooks in all sizes. We got our bait from the kitchen staff as well. We gave most of our fish to the locals. They seemed to really appreciate it, and were very helpful.  I can't wait to go back. Had a blast down there!  EDIT: Best time is when the tides change   S."
