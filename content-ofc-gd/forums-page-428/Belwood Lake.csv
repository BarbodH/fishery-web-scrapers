Didn't expect anything but a day of tuning in the new Citica and Saros F and that's what happened. No bites but a beautiful day sitting by the water wetting a line. Ice is not completely out yet so they're not letting anyone launch a boat and no boat rentals yet. Open water is basically by the Shand Dam, the rest looks to be full of slush ice. It was a great day for 3-4 hours just tossing the line in the water and sitting there .  Bill"
