677120,Terry,2012-03-17 23:52:00,14456,If you have a boat that is true. But finding shoreline where fish hang out is hard
677160,Ron,2012-03-18 01:47:00,1683,"They would hang out further up if they don't get caught and kept. They don't get a chance to grow before they get tossed.in a pailand eventually in a pan...  Cheers, Ron..."
677176,EC1,2012-03-18 02:13:00,930," I read an article few weeks back...Really wish I had bookmarked it. (If someone else read it please PM me) It was an article about panfish (especially crappies) and their harvesting in general of North America.  The jist of it was that on pressured lakes, up to 30-40% of an entire year class would be removed out of a lake and that there is no way in hell mother nature can reproduce what was taken. And with the imprinted idea of panfish being ""the bigger the better to keep"", larger fish are truly getting rarer and rarer.  Really sucks to see when spots that used to produce really nice fish consistently are now nurseries for 4-5"" crappies."
677214,EC1,2012-03-18 05:36:00,930,Somehow I ended up finding it. Just something to think about and reflect I suppose.  The Bite on My Favourite Lake
677244,Beans,2012-03-18 14:22:00,3339, Sorry Nick...to tell anyone about ...er...um...you know...is to suffer the wrath of Uncle Vinny (The Chin) and Cousin Guido...   
677384,BillM,2012-03-18 23:37:00,17367,"Got the Lund out today for the first time in 2012.  No crappies, but a few dink perch.  Water was 33 degrees, a wee bit to cold for them just yet"
677388,Christopheraaron,2012-03-18 23:58:00,3525,"Went out to the holland this afternoon, LOTS of white bucket anglers, 1 tiny crappie for me maybe 4 inches, tons of sunfish, perch and a couple of accident bass. Can we start making entries for the tournament, I got a nice little perch I'd like to enter?"
677442,Sinker,2012-03-19 03:19:00,8692,"I can't seem to get on the crappies, but the perch are willing   Found some 44 degree water, and it was full of these guys    Crappies are next on my hit list. I've tried them twice now with nothing to show, so the third time is a charm, and i have just the spot!  S."
677460,Billy Bob,2012-03-19 10:41:00,5865,I hear you Sinker..........my last two outing have been about the same as yours except for 3 crappies and LOTS of White Bass too.....Hoping today will be different and I score with some Silver ones.....which are my favorite for the frying pan..
677561,Christopheraaron,2012-03-19 17:28:00,3525,was that the holland too?
677567,jimmer,2012-03-19 17:57:00,2730,"Unfortunately, this happens all the time. More now that we have access to the internet for information. I have definitely seen a nose dive in population since 2 years ago on the lake that I tend to fish for them. There is always a boat or two on every spot that is visible. Those spots usually get cleaned out of most of the spawners. So, the article makes sense."
677574,CRAPPIE,2012-03-19 18:29:00,213," That's why I gave up to fish in there since 5 years ago. Used to get very big slap but not anymore. My friend got a good spot for good size slap but everytime he bring me to this spot, I have to cover my eyes until I arrive this spot and full body search make sure no GPS to mark the spot. LOL "
677787,Christopheraaron,2012-03-20 01:48:00,3525,"up to the holland again today, crappie rising everywhere but nothing biting, a few sunfish."
677806,BillM,2012-03-20 03:09:00,17367,Rising?  Bring your flyrod the next time!
677913,Christopheraaron,2012-03-20 17:30:00,3525,"I know, I was really mad at myself, ahh well a couple of days until I go back."
678097,Sinker,2012-03-21 03:11:00,8692,"I caught enough crappies for a fry tonight, but they're still not going at full force yet. Its better every day though, so maybe tomorrow will be the day?  I have 12 filleted and in the fridge for dinner tomorrow night. Mission accomplished  S."
678133,Christopheraaron,2012-03-21 12:31:00,3525,"I'm going tonight so let you know, but I'm a bit worried about this heat."
675555,Billy Bob,2012-03-13 11:06:00,5865,All our ice is GONE....  Boat is back since yesterday....needs to be prepped...  Weather looks good for tomorrow and even BETTER on Thursday 64 degrees...  I will be heading out Wed or Thurs for crappie on Chautauqua Lake....  I could even fish for walleye as Thursday is the last day until it reopens again on the first Sat of May...  So is anyone boat fishing for crappies up there or are you guys still ice in ?
675564,The Urban Fisherman,2012-03-13 12:04:00,2050,"Wide open here Billy - Hoping to get out with my old man and my daughter on the weekend! Usually we do better mid april.. At that time you can even get into some big slabs with small crankbaits, but I'm hoping the warm winter and early ice-out has got them moving in early!  Good Luck - Chautauqua is a fun lake to fish!"
675567,BillM,2012-03-13 12:13:00,17367,Going to sneak out to a spot up here in the near future!
675572,Thrilla,2012-03-13 12:30:00,164,"Crappie are definitely starting, not huge numbers yet but they are there"
675593,Beans,2012-03-13 13:47:00,3339, watchin' the ice and countin' the days (sigh*)

675623,bigugli,2012-03-13 15:08:00,6138,And BillyBob is south of me.

676298,Christopheraaron,2012-03-15 02:40:00,3525,Think they'll be in the Holland yet?
676436,jeffw,2012-03-15 17:34:00,267,i'm hoping they are in Holland river fishing there tonight. Cheers Jeff
676438,i2cool2fool,2012-03-15 17:40:00,349,"With all this fishing talk, I need to get my boat and gear dusted off.  Good luck tonight jeffw!"

676735,Christopheraaron,2012-03-16 15:13:00,3525,"Hate when you catch oos fish, especially when it's big and you can't get a picture.  PS congrats with the tickets!"
676770,NAW,2012-03-16 16:36:00,4022,  How would one go about getting on this calling list??
