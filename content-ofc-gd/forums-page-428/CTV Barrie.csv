I sent this.  Moose and deer do not hibranate,you need to learn more before broadcasting some of your stories.  They replied   Hi Betty and Brian,    Thank you for your email – you’re absolutely right.  We’ve clarified this in our coverage of the animals story for our 11pm newscast.   Thanks again,    CTV Barrie News Producers"

678463,bigugli,2012-03-22 13:37:00,6138,You didn't really think that people in the news media actually posessed any real intelligence
678467,misfish,2012-03-22 13:43:00,29133,Im waiting to see how they report the upcoming turkey hunt.
678469,Dave Bailey,2012-03-22 13:51:00,1641,"I've heard some people saying that the birds are coming back early because of the warmth. Nope. Most birds migrate based on photoperiod, not temperature. Some make a mistake and come back too early, happens every year. But this year people are noticing it and assuming the warm weather is doing it."
678470,NAW,2012-03-22 13:51:00,4022,This years turkey hunt will be all messed up.  They came out of hibranation early
678472,Nipfisher,2012-03-22 13:52:00,2449,  They will probably report that the Turkeys have returned from flying down to South America for the winter lol.
678474,BillM,2012-03-22 13:58:00,17367,Oldman had 18 turkeys in the back yard yesterday
678476,Harrison,2012-03-22 14:00:00,2202," ""In todays news, If your thinking of a nice hike in the woods, think again. There are reports of people hiding in the forest dressed in camo making weird turkey mating noises. Our analysts have unveiled it may be a sacrifice ritual by a cult. Others believe it is hunters, but we have confirmed hunting season is in the fall. Stay tuned, more to come as we gather the facts... now onto another breaking story... sign bent at 400 and Bayfeild..."""
