678555,Nipfisher,2012-03-22 18:39:00,2449,  He should take a 400 mile drive south and go join another team. I'll take a bag of pucks or golf balls for him as long as he takes his contract with him.

678610,bassmaster4,2012-03-22 20:56:00,801,does anyone have any solid proof of this? seen it come up in another post as well! just curious.
678696,Oggie,2012-03-23 01:17:00,588,I wonder if dion has a middle ear infection? He has no balance. He falls more than the peewees i coached. It would explain his wild shot too.
