678235,Spiel,2012-03-21 18:11:00,9065,  Exactly!
678249,Roe Bag,2012-03-21 18:40:00,246, Kudos Mr. Ritchie. Couldn't be better said. Thank you.
678250,davey buoy,2012-03-21 18:45:00,5505," I believe that's a top ten post:thumbsup_anim:,What else can you say."
678254,Harrison,2012-03-21 18:55:00,2202," Well written Craig.  Another senstitive area is crappie spots in the spring. One of my fav's was just destroyed after being posted on the net and then shown on TV.  Actually know a land owner with shoreline there, he's really looking forward to this spring.  It's a slaughter."
678258,Spiel,2012-03-21 19:06:00,9065,"   I'll add to that ""sensitive"" comment Harrison in the form of the constant updates at the ""Ganny"" fish ladder, while it's certainly interesting to know it could have/should have waited till a later date IMO."
678268,reelinrolly,2012-03-21 19:27:00,281,"This is awesome!!!  Ive been kicked off other forums for expressing my view on this topic.  While rivers may be long and lakes may be vast,  they sure seem to shrink when you get a million people on them lol.  I post reports on other local sites that are vague in nature.  Water temp, depth, lure choice, trolling speed, clarity.  But at the same time I try not to pin point exactly where I was.  A report such as this can at least set an angler in the right direction without attracting a million people to your area. \ IMO"
678289,misfish,2012-03-21 20:47:00,29133, This makes perfect sense. Need to rethink. Thanks
678322,Pikeslayer,2012-03-21 22:38:00,1443,"I've been giving this thread a lot of thought since it was posted. I suppose what would make me most happy, is to never see another locked/deleted thread related to a fishing report on OFC. There have been many positive ideas and opinions expressed so far and it seems there is no shortage of members who would welcome positive change. So....what if, There was a sub forum devoted to fishing reports. Where a report is delayed/hidden from viewing for a short period of time (as BillM suggests). What if, This sub forum was 'managed' by a group of volunteer mentors who are passionate about this sensitive issue? Mentors could review,approve or request revisions (by the OP) before releasing for general view. What if, Members of this community continue to ""opt out"" of posting a report because they're ""not sure about proper etiquette"". Yes, there are rules as Art reminded us all. Some are black & white, others are grey. Does ""prefer"" mean yes you can, or no you can't? As for ""common sense""; “Common sense is not so common.” ― Voltaire “Common sense is the most widely shared commodity in the world, for every man is convinced that he is well supplied with it.” ― René Descartes So what if, We tried 'change'? Something different. Something that would make us a stronger community?  And that's what might make us all happy.  “Don't find fault, find a remedy; anybody can complain” ― Henry Ford   Sincerely, Slayer"
678331,mercman,2012-03-21 23:29:00,7054,"What i would like, is that if everyone realized that we are all here to share our passion with each other, not to deliberately hurt the sport we all love. Some of us have little experience, some of us have many years of experience.When you see a post that is too explicit, or one that you suspect may be OOS fishing, or breaking some rule either of this forum or the fishing regulations, use the PM system to ask questions of the OP regarding the thread instead of flaming or forcing someone to publicly defend themselves on an open forum.I dont think many are foolish enough to deliberately bring the wrath of God down on themselves.I bet many are just excited about thier day on the water. And be polite above all things.We are all human beings, and deserve to be treated with respect.Every single one of us, from the newest newbie, to the most seasoned veteran angler, has something to offer this forum.  Best Regards  Paul"
678333,Roy,2012-03-21 23:39:00,13728,"Yeah, I'll agree with Paul on this one."
678340,spincast,2012-03-22 00:18:00,3279,"Well said Paul - The job of moderating the content, and the adherence to the forum rules, should lie with the mods. If a post transgresses the rules, MODify it and notify the OP why in a PM. Flamethrowers do nothing to improve the experience of the site. Notify a mod if you feel a post shouldnt be on. No need to blast and belittle in public. Craig made some extremely valid points. A local trout stream I used to love fishing got a write upon OOD about 10 or so years ago. It used to hold 10 lbers and could be counted on for season long trout. Now, if you see anything come out of there it is less then 12"" long, and far too frequently on a stringer of someone who neither reads nor cares about the regs. This site is not intended to be a wikpedia of where to harvest fish, but those who have no respect will use it as such, and we should be mindful of that when posting  Strive to find balance. Respect the resource, and respect the members. The two are not necessarily mutually exclusive."
677960,davey buoy,2012-03-20 20:45:00,5505,"Lately things are getting a little heated over fishing areas,so here's a couple questions; First-Should we talk about lakes fished and how much many we caught,lakes are huge in general Second-Should we talk about rivers fished and how many we caught,Most rivers are miles long. The reason I ask as reporting about good fishing and great days,without pin pointing and giving exact locations ,is it really bad for our lakes and rivers?. Maybe best not to give lake or river names with little or no background,and let everyone fend for there selves?. I think it may be interesting to hear others views?,what do you think?."
677964,misfish,2012-03-20 21:09:00,29133,"  You fish one of my spots, and I show up and see you there,you better have yer boxing gloves.  Lots of anger about back ground shots."
677965,davey buoy,2012-03-20 21:10:00,5505,"I was dragged a little bit under the bus last week when I fished a southern trib,and couldn't catch a cold if my life depended on it.Everything I said was hearsay,and did not give a location at all. I bit my tongue and let it go. I guess I should of said I fished somewhere and had fun.I even think the mods pulled it for a bit and then put it back,as a few pm's reported. I guess I get a bit excited when I have a good time.lol.Imagine when I catch something!"
677972,Gregoire,2012-03-20 21:31:00,1397,It seems to me that their is a bit of a double standard in terms of river vs lake reports. I guess this may be because many of the tribs that people fish are very close to urban areas and some don't want these spots inundated with people. Personally I think if you allow people to report lake names then river names should be allowed as well. It doesn't seem fair.  Having said that I've never fished a trib in my life.
677979,misfish,2012-03-20 22:19:00,29133," Live on Dave,live on."
677986,aplumma,2012-03-20 22:59:00,6896,"This may help clear it up it is a quote from the rules of OFC.  We would prefer that you do not post pictures of fish caught out of season.  Please do not post VERY SPECIFIC information on fishing spots, ie pinpoint locations and maps. It is our belief that sharing this type of knowledge to the general public is not at all good for the resource itself. When communicating info on spots, please keep it to email or a PM.   Past this point use common sense if their is a landmark in the background then crop or blur it out. Most of the fish I take photos of are boat side with the water as the background it saves on the smart comments and nitpicking that some people will reward you with. Keep in mind if you get the odd smart comment and the majority of comments are positive then consider it a winning post and ignore the few.   Art"

677990,Rod Caster,2012-03-20 23:15:00,5784,"Do what my Dad did for years... send everyone to a chub filled creek or burbot filled lake when they ask ""where did you catch all those fish"". Songis Creek must be out of chub by now because of him haha.  I agree with Art's run-down. People don't want their spots mentioned and will be upset if someone else is advertising them. I try to post fishing reports that will give me the least amount of headaches by focusing on other things like lure choice, depths etc and not mentioning lake names or visinity.. Of course, the population of the south dictates that you'll get all kinds of responses no matter what you believe is right. We don't get the same amount of scrutiny up north, but I'm sure someone would snap if I mentioned the name of good speckled trout lakes up here.    "
677992,misfish,2012-03-20 23:18:00,29133,"Dave as you know,where i fish is C&R.Im not into it for the meat.Fish on and good times. To me it means nothing if they know the back ground where i fish.

678020,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-21 00:20:00,0,i'm not even interested in where people caught their fish! i just want fish porn! keep it to yourselves!
678021,Dave Bailey,2012-03-21 00:21:00,1641, Where is that? can't find it on the net. I want to catch chub! Do you have a grid reference? GPS co-ordinates? Have any pictures with backgrounds?  
678026,BillM,2012-03-21 00:34:00,17367,"We don't need up to date fishing reports every single time someone goes on the river.  Seriously, wait a week or so until conditions are crap then post up about your success.  Drives me crazy."
678034,Rod Caster,2012-03-21 00:52:00,5784," It's right beside Clear Lake and Trout Lake.  Search the net and you'll get a couple hits.   I think the idea should be to give people inspiration to fish, but let them find fish themselves. Searching is more than half the fun for me. If I had half the skunk suits I've worn, I'd be a lesser fisherman."
678052,bassmaster4,2012-03-21 01:35:00,801,"agreed, had this happen to me a few times gets me angry how people who ""enjoy"" fishing so much wont make the effort to do the homework and bushwacking to find their own spots gets me fuming!"

678221,davey buoy,2012-03-21 17:41:00,5505,"So what I'm getting is one bad apple doesn't spoil the bunch, Don't say anything till after a couple weeks when it's not nice,no river names,big lakes may be okay?,obviously not your favorite spot,what else have I missed?. OH,when we think someone is fishing out of season that's not OK.And that is regulated by people that drive by evey day,as I pass by many rivers in a week,sometimes ice,sometimes nice!.I think I got it finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Thanks to everyone to help me clear things up.:thumbsup_anim:Almost forgot a picture is worth ? ah ah ah,I Forgot now."
678226,craigdritchie,2012-03-21 17:56:00,1586,"Rivers may be miles in length, but at this time of year the sections you're actually allowed to fish might be limited to only a couple of hundred yards. It's impossible to not be overly specific when identifying a location.  Beyond that, as Bill notes, timing is a really big issue. Everyone knows that the XXXX river has a steelhead run. But that doesn't mean the fish are there all day, every day. When they are present, they're extremely vulnerable to over-harvest. Remember, lots of people read these posts. I've seen it again and again where someone puts a picture on the internet, and the next day, there are a gazillion cars at the spot. Those fish get hammered, and it's not fair - to other guys who fish there, or to the fish themselves.  And, let's be honest, not all of the people reading these posts are ethical anglers who obey the regs. The clowns who go down there at night with nets and grappling hooks to slaughter fish for eggs also read these boards. In fact, it's probably their best source of information on where and when to go. Should we really be helping them?  I like fish porn as much as the next guy, but not if it will negatively impact the fish. How about we all post shots from last summer's bass fishing? I'd like to see that now. We can look at the steelhead shots in July, when they're safely back in the lake."
