678092,Dave Bailey,2012-03-21 02:58:00,1641,"Trying braided line for the first time (actually the second, but we don't want to revisit that thread again...) and I've read that it works a bit differently from mono as far as knots go. According to a piece in the latest Just Fishing strength can drop to 50%  So now I'm looking for help from you experts. Up to now I've palomared just about everything, it's easy on my arthritic fingers and ageing eyes. Occasionally a clinch knot or a trilene knot. I would imagine that the rough surface of braid might create havoc trying to snug up a knot, it won't slide as easily as mono that's for sure. Anyway, are these knots okay with braid, or are there better?  And as far as strength goes, call me nuts (it's been done before) but I'm wondering if a drop of Krazy Glue might hold it together. I know it might make for some frustrating time getting the terminal tackle off, but I could just cut above it, put a new swivel on, and later spend an evening with nail clippers getting line off old ones. You can tell I have no life  By the way, the line currently installed is 20lb Berkely PowerPro."
678093,irishfield,2012-03-21 03:01:00,26272,Palomar knot. I use to do the trilene thing and found out that it slips on braid.. and then the fishy is GONE!
678098,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-21 03:14:00,10439,"Yep, palomar knot for terminal connections and double uni for joining to mono or flouro leaders."
678099,Sinker,2012-03-21 03:20:00,8692,"I use the improved clinch for EVERYTHING. Braid, mono, fluoro....joining leaders....never fails me.  One thing I do though, is melt the tag end off. It leaves a little melted nub on the end of the braid, that won't slip thru IF the knot slips. I've never had a problem.  S."
678100,NANUK,2012-03-21 03:21:00,797,"Most of the time I just tie an improved clinch or Trilene knot on braid, never had the knot slip even on muskie tackle. Polomer works great too."
678101,backbay,2012-03-21 03:46:00,773,"Palomar. strong, quick to tie."
678102,irishfield,2012-03-21 03:48:00,26272, Yep.. I melt a ball as well.. stops the fraying plus gives that added no-slip bonus
678103,Dabluz,2012-03-21 03:49:00,701," Yes....braids and fused lines are notorious for having weak knot strength and that's why 20 lb braids and fused lines have a breaking strength way over 20 lbs.  The strongest of the lot is Fireline.  20 lb test Fireline breaks at around 47 lbs.  So even if the knot diminishes the line strength by 50%, you are still using 20 lb test line.  There have been a couple of independent strength tests carried out over the years and you can find them on the internet.  I think I read that the Palomar knot only loses about 20 to 30% of the rated breaking strength of braids and fused lines."
678106,Garfisher,2012-03-21 04:49:00,229,"I use the ""fish-n-fool"" knot for braid. Pretty simple and its very strong (stronger than a palomar I think). I havent had the knot snap on me yet using braid"
678108,kickingfrog,2012-03-21 08:55:00,8333,I used an improved clinch knot but switched after I started to use braid. I use a knot that power pro has listed on the package and their  website. It takes more time to tie then some but I've had no issues ... So far.
678119,Harrison,2012-03-21 11:28:00,2202,Palomar braid and drop shot. Improved clinch mono/fluoro.  Improved clinch will slip with braid.
678122,Dave Bailey,2012-03-21 11:45:00,1641,"Thank you gentlemen, sounds like the Palomar is in the lead so far."
678125,cynmar,2012-03-21 11:54:00,169," I was using the uni to uni to tie leader to braid until got shown the improved surgeon's knot, way simpler , smaller to go through the guides and no slip."
678129,Homer Is King,2012-03-21 12:11:00,305, X2 - these are the knots I use too.  I've lost a lot of fish but never from knot failure!  I think the 50% strength reduction applies to any line or rope with a knot in it.
678130,BillM,2012-03-21 12:11:00,17367,"Palomar or the Nanofil knot, either will work just great with braid."
678145,BucktownAngler,2012-03-21 13:20:00,582, X3  Never had these knots fail me & very quick and easy to tie
678146,COUNTRYBOY,2012-03-21 13:26:00,130,  THAT'S THE SAME METHOD I USE AND NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT..THE ONLY THING IS IF IT FRAYES A BIT THAN RE TIE IT
678174,bare foot wader,2012-03-21 15:19:00,1354,albright or improved albright/alberto know to connect braid to leader of roughly equal sizes....sometimes use a jam knot to tie 60+ lb leaders  uni knot for tying straight to terminal tackle...with light braid i double the line up....double the line up and tie a trilene knot works fine for me
678180,Lunatic,2012-03-21 15:43:00,536,"I use palomar on everything now,no slips or breaks at the knot to date"
678187,Live2fish85,2012-03-21 16:06:00,1633,Palomar Knot always for my braided line.
678198,Andrew Grant,2012-03-21 16:37:00,201,.
678270,GBW,2012-03-21 19:38:00,8460,"Dave, bring the stuff from the pic in your avatar over to my place and we can tie and test stuff till the cow's come home (and I don't mean the women ). Palomar all the way here for basic braid and ""nanofil"" for any slicker lines.  uni-2-uni to join any braid to mono/floro has yet to fail me.  an extra wrap or 2 helps too"
678272,Harrison,2012-03-21 19:42:00,2202,"When braids and superlines first came on the market it was common when a buddy lost a fish on the hookset or in the heavy junk to ask ""did you use a palomar?"""
678276,mercman,2012-03-21 19:59:00,7054,"I started using the Palomar knot on all lines,last season.Its much easier to tie while wearing gloves"
678365,Dabluz,2012-03-22 01:23:00,701," I call that the ""double Palomar"" and it's the one I use....especially when using fine fused or braided line.  It does not slip at all.  Pull hard on a single Palomar to see if it slips.  I did a few times and was surprised to see it slip so I went to the double Palomar."
