678416,Big Cliff,2012-03-22 08:54:00,6899,"Well, the ice finally went out of our little bay on Tuesday, so last night I decided to put the boat in and take a little tour. Boat started like it had been running yesterday and everything worked just the way it should. There is still plenty of ice out on the main body of the lake but Goose Bay is clear of ice. Water temperature seemed to be in about the 54° range for the most part. It was a short trip and I didn't get to wet a line but I am hoping to change that tonight."

678495,whiskywizard,2012-03-22 15:30:00,305, That's good news Cliff. Let's hope this imposter Spring holds on for a couple more weeks until the real Spring arrives.
678625,Big Cliff,2012-03-22 21:46:00,6899,"Don't worry Mike, once my boat goes in the water spring is official!!!!! Even the big guy upstairs wouldn't have the heart to pull it back on me!"

678683,Big Cliff,2012-03-23 00:41:00,6899,"Yes, well at least part of it is. We have two young collage students staying with us and one of them very kindly gave me a hand last evening and we put the first section in (enough to launch the boat LOL) The other two sections will come when the water is warmer."
