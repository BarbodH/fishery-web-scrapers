677490,BucktownAngler,2012-03-19 13:46:00,582,"Has anybody seen/have or know anything about this lure?  Its called a Burmek B1, theres not too much information to be found on google about it. I believe its from the 70's  I picked it up at the sportsmen show in one of the bargain bins, as part of a 5/$20 deal. The price tag on it is $30  I figured id give it a try, especially because i havent seen it anywhere else before    "

677500,GbayGiant,2012-03-19 14:20:00,1780,Only good for speeds less than 3 mph. I never had any luck with it.
677588,bucktail,2012-03-19 18:52:00,1857,GBay is right. Man its been along time since I have seen one of these!
677610,johnnyb,2012-03-19 19:55:00,3413,Did it come with any musky recipes attached?   I've heard of them for sure....never seen one.  Looking forward to a report on this when musky season opens
677623,Raf,2012-03-19 20:23:00,3495,Today's wisdom says you should be trolling fast to catch muskies.  May or may not be true.  Just remember muskies don't read forums/magazines.  Give it a shot.
677632,davey buoy,2012-03-19 20:35:00,5505,"Looks as good as any,I suppose?. Price is right."
677702,Rizzo,2012-03-19 23:20:00,4754,its red and white. Muskies won't eat that colour combination...send it to me and I'll dispose of it properly for you
677711,Andy,2012-03-19 23:36:00,330," I've read about them on other forums. A few guys love 'em, most don't seem to care for them. That being said, I've spent days fishing the latest and greatest lures available, and still come up with nothing until I switch to something that I have never caught a fish on before, so you might as well give it a shot. Pls post a picture if you get one on it!"
677714,Handlebarz,2012-03-19 23:40:00,3790,I have seen them in fishing boxes but never seen one in use. I do remember on one site a guy was looking for them so I would imagine that they have there place and tine
678698,mike rousseau,2012-03-23 01:21:00,4661,rollie and helens musky shop sells them...  i had an old one.... never caught on it... and boy o tried...
