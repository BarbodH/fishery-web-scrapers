677860,lew,2012-03-20 12:41:00,12766,"I never really spent alot of time at BPS, maybe 1/2 dozen times or so over the years. My wife enjoys wandering around the mall so we'd usually go up at Christmas, do BPS, the Mall and then have lunch and head home.  I always enjoyed my trips there and can honestly say I never really had a bad experience.  99% of my musky gear comes from JB's so I never really bought any fishing stuff at BPS but I bought some camping gear there and a couple rain suits.  I like the store and enjoy wandering around but haven't been there in a year or so but will maybe make the trip down there again someday."
677864,lookinforwalleye,2012-03-20 13:02:00,4399,"Ditto with what Lew said, I like going once in a while spent the day there Saturday did the mall crawl with the wife and then a nice dinner at the Keg. Never had a bad experience at BPS, Mike at the electronics counter was very helpful in getting me what I wanted!"
677883,Toddyc20,2012-03-20 15:22:00,141,"I used to buy all my gear at bass pro but lately my brother and I have been buying most of our gear from tackle warehouse.  They have the brand new items well before bass pro carries them.  There shipping prices are so reasonable that it is close to what it would cost for us to drive to bass pro.  When I factor in the significantly lower prices, tackle warehouse gets my business."
677897,steel&chrome,2012-03-20 16:00:00,46,"IMO, SAIL's prices are much better than BPS"
677902,whiskywizard,2012-03-20 16:25:00,305,"I've been in 4 or 5 BPS in the US. They feel different than the one in Vaughan. There's more choice, especially in clothing, and the staff work hard to be pleasant. There's two I particularly liked; the one in Prattville, AL has the nicest people. The one in Lawrenceville, GA, outside Atlanta is really big with great selections."
677975,COUNTRYBOY,2012-03-20 21:51:00,130,"  CAN'T BLAME YOU THERE, I AM THE SAME WAY..I GIVE SOMEONE THE CHANCE TO TAKE MY MONEY ONCE AND IF IT LEAVES A BAD TASTE IN MY MOUTH, I SIMPLY DON'T RETURN..."
677982,i2cool2fool,2012-03-20 22:39:00,349,"I only go to BPS once a year. In my case, each visit is enjoyable an they have what I need and more. Perhaps my needs are basic compared to what others are going for. May I've been lucky."
677983,davey buoy,2012-03-20 22:41:00,5505," I aree,at least with the vaughn store,Last wednesday when I was there I heard a fellow saying ""Why don't you carry the higher end reel I'm asking for?You tell me you only carry them in the states"".Can't repeat the last few words."
678059,BillM,2012-03-21 01:49:00,17367,"I like BPS..  I get to drop in on the way home from work, check out some new gear, maybe buy a few things etc..   I really can't complain about anything.."
678080,SirWhite,2012-03-21 02:28:00,210,"Was there today. Reel service was good, just for the two customers in front of me though, as I waited for 15 minutes with the reel I wanted in my hand to no avail. However, I did find them quite polite, as many said ""excuse me"" as they strolled in front of my ""where is that thing I'm looking for"" glare. Must of happened three times at least. I wasn't asked to be helped, the whole time. But, I'm not sure there's a better place to get lost in! My eyes must've lit up a few times! Saw the 13"" Grandma for the first time lol. Also Kermies are in a sales bin. Our classifieds seem to be the best place to shop for gear"
677150,bramptonjerry,2012-03-18 01:21:00,132,"went down this afternoon, not as busy as I had experienced in past years.  All quality rods on sale were picked bare...very little to choose from, was gonna buy a reel but the line up at the counter was at least 1/2 hour to get served, the usual guys were very helpful and the usual guys were huddled together in groups of 3 or 4 pretending not to notice that people were looking for help...did not come away with a good feeling at all...can we please get some competition around here for them, I even eaves dropped on what must have been a managers comments about the lack of product on the shelves...was very dissapointed today"
677153,uglyfish,2012-03-18 01:27:00,981,"thats typical for BPS. which is why i save my gas and shop at fishing world, or bills bait in hamilton. better prices, and discounts on top of the prices. better service, always has what i need or gets in in a day or 2."
677159,coreyhkh,2012-03-18 01:46:00,163,"I was there also and I wanted to get some of the new power pro super-slick, it was sold out, they should bring in extra stock for items."
677182,kickingfrog,2012-03-18 02:34:00,8333,"They had everything I needed, and a few things I didn't need."
677186,Sinker,2012-03-18 02:41:00,8692,I left there empty handed last week.
677187,Handlebarz,2012-03-18 02:43:00,3790,I was going to stop in but the parking lot was packed at 10:45 so I did not even try to go there with my transport there was room on the south side but I did not want to get boxed in.
677194,beertech,2012-03-18 02:50:00,118,This will be my second year not going to the basspro spring sale.  The fad is gone for me. I have found my local store has more of the items i use.  prices are 20 percent higher aswell at basspro.   
677203,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-18 03:21:00,0,"bps is more of an amusement park for grown men than an outdoors store.  i would rather hit a specialty shop any day of the week. even when i order online, i like dealing with cabelas."
677205,Nipfisher,2012-03-18 03:27:00,2449,I agree Doc.  BPS is just an attraction for me. If the wife wants to go to LuLu Lemon or shopping for the kids then I stop in. Usually only spend $100 per year there.
677212,Twocoda,2012-03-18 04:58:00,4130,"Salmon Pro,Steelhead Pro or Musky Pro then i would go....Bass Pro?? pleah....not even a real fish is it"
677223,MCTFisher9120,2012-03-18 11:57:00,3761,"  O know you didn't just say that  Musky...pfft the fish that dies if you fight it out..some almighty they are  Bass Pro is a fun store, I like the fish tank and the boats...bout it for me."
677251,limeyangler,2012-03-18 15:22:00,5204,  LOL...awesome Mike!
677253,cynmar,2012-03-18 15:33:00,169,"There is a reason Muskie only hit if you do a figure 8 or a big O They're ""fairy "" nice fish. :clapping:"
677259,uglyfish,2012-03-18 16:00:00,981," Yup, that's how I see it. Pretty much just a place to kill a few hours. Kids love to go see the store, I only go if I really need something from there or if there's a sale item I can't let slip away for the price. Otherwise, its just someplace for fun for the kids."
677280,i2cool2fool,2012-03-18 17:14:00,349,I am 10 mins away from Angling Outfitters near Woodstock. It's almost Heavenly (I imagine at least). BPS is nice amusement stop for me when in Toronto. Sometime good deals but not my primary reason to burn gas to Toronto.
677665,Joeytier,2012-03-19 21:34:00,3990, There's a SAIL about five minutes away...
677669,misfish,2012-03-19 21:45:00,29133,"  From what I have seen,they are not competition,but do have some better deals ."
677672,bigugli,2012-03-19 21:50:00,6138,"BPS gets 2 visits a year. Once, before Christmas to give the Mrs some gift ideas. Once if I'm running home early from a fishing trip  and the traffic is too heavy. I hate sitting 3 hours just to get through Toronto."
677676,COUNTRYBOY,2012-03-19 21:57:00,130,  I ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY HAD GOOD PRICES BUT I THINK I GOT CAUGHT UP IN ALL THE DECOR...IS SHOP FOR MY LURES AT LEBARONS...WAY BETTER PRICES AND GOOD KNOWLEDGEABLE PEOPLE
677680,davey buoy,2012-03-19 22:16:00,5505, I AGREE !
677681,bigugli,2012-03-19 22:17:00,6138,"I haven't been to a LeBaron's since the old Willowdale store.  Got treated like dirt the last time there. I walked in after work, and after asking for some help selecting a new reel, I was led to the discount reels and told I might have better luck at Zellers. I will never step foot into any business posessing such an arrogant attitude."
677698,MCTFisher9120,2012-03-19 23:05:00,3761, I thought it was good  Ahh the sunshine and warm temps are making us all feel good these days I think. Can't wait to get out for some fishing soon
677703,Roe Bag,2012-03-19 23:21:00,246," I was there day one, square one. Friday March 9 at 10:00 am. All the quality rods were picked bare then and you couldn't get near the reel counter. I only had a small list. Couldn't fill half of it. Ended up leaving with three items totalling less than $25. Factor in the travel time and the gas and I got beat big time! If you're gonna have a sale, at least have some product on the shelves!"
677850,jedimaster,2012-03-20 12:13:00,3472,"For me its not so much the lack of stock or specialty stuff, or new stuff to the market, or the latest trends, or the competative prices or the actualy helpful stuff staff that seem interested in helping, or the management that is completly beligerant.... Nah... Its not one thing for me... Its pretty much everything. Fortunatly when I have had to make complaints to the head office in the US of A they were dealth with quickly. Basspro has become walmart, on occaision you go because they have some of everything but don't expect much."
677855,bigugli,2012-03-20 12:22:00,6138,By jove I think he's got it!!
