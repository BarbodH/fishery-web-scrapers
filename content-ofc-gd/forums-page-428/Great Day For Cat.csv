677252,Rod Caster,2012-03-18 15:27:00,5784,"What type of cats are those? We get channel cats on the ottawa river, but the don't look quite the same, plus ours are greyish in colour."
677305,Steve Piggott,2012-03-18 19:39:00,196,They are channel cats. They come into the Grand river from Lake Erie that is why they look different. We get grey ones but I think they stay in the river all the time.
677324,wormdunker,2012-03-18 21:25:00,1711,"Good lookin cats Steve.  I've been meaning to ask - R U related to the Piggott Construction family.  If so I worked for them from 1984 -1994.
