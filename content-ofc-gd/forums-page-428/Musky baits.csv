668187,lew,2012-02-20 14:27:00,12766,  I didn't say they were fun baits to work for 12 hours straight Larry
668228,captpierre,2012-02-20 18:06:00,2521,"Thanks Lew.  I'll give it a try.  With this catch and release fishery, pressured fish learn from previous hookups.  The more variety the better.  Although I think if there is an active fish nearby, they would likely grab anything."
668229,Pigeontroller,2012-02-20 18:11:00,2793,"Another fun Jerk-bait (Glider) to work is the Hellhound by ERC, I particularly like the smaller Hellpuppy. They can be worked slow with a nice steady sub-surface walk-the-dog retrieve, or fast and they really dart side to side and up and down erractically, especially the 'Puppy...Here is a few custom painted examples by Bare Bones Baits.

678245,BucktownAngler,2012-03-21 18:34:00,582, ill have to give that a try
678252,lew,2012-03-21 18:51:00,12766,It's easy to do Boss.
678253,ehg,2012-03-21 18:52:00,2666,"If was on a Kawarthas lake and had two choices of lure they would be, Silver bladed black bucktail, and this perch Super Shad Rap. http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v615/shiffy/?action=view&current=IMG_0690-1.jpg"
678261,BucktownAngler,2012-03-21 19:18:00,582," ive used that super shad rap for years and never even had a hit on it, still looks brand new. Hopefully i can break it in this summer.  i like Believers, Grandmas/Jakes, Savage gear"
667406,Lunatic,2012-02-17 04:16:00,536,"I would like to try for musky this year,ive never caught one before,nor have i tried for them,but ive fished lakes that hold them and ive always wanted to catch one but i wouldnt know where to start. so im thinking if you could only take 2 lures with you to fish for musky what would they be? any other advice or tips would be good too."
667408,Nipfisher,2012-02-17 04:21:00,2449,Whoa........get ready for this.........90% of the replys will be about having the right equiptment to land the fish and the right release tools to get it back in the water asap. Lots of lure options.
667409,Live2fish85,2012-02-17 04:27:00,1633,I am going to agree with you on that one Nipfisher. As for the OP question I am not at all experienced enough to answer this only went out for Musky on one trip did good but I got no clue on top lures. Good luck I will say one thing google search it. I did and learbt what to do when I was out there and lots more which paid off. Also make sure you have the right gear. For your own safety.
667410,Pigeontroller,2012-02-17 04:27:00,2793,"Thats exactly what I was gonna say...And there's nothing wrong with that. Muskie are big scary fish that are not easy to handle, and are easily killed for all their fierceness...Consider coming to a meeting of the Hamilton Chapter of Muskies Canada, we meet on the 2nd Wednesday of each month in Upper Hamilton.  If you'd like to get a feel for Muskie fishing I'd be happy to take you out this season.  2 lures? Bucktail(in-line spinner) and 10"" Jake (crankbait)"
667420,backbay,2012-02-17 05:11:00,773,"^^^ What Pigeon said, and for lures, anything that's big and black! If you can make it up to the Spring Boat Show, Muskie Sunday will give you the best head start you could ever hope for, seriously. As an aside, is there an area you've decided to target them?"
667422,Lunatic,2012-02-17 05:27:00,536,"looks like im going to have to research some more on musky. i have a med/hvy rod that has handled big pike with ease? i have a rubber net.but ill need to learn more about handling them before i go further. im a catch and release guy anyway,so i dont want any accidental kills due to ignorance. ive only had too accidental kills in my life (both pike) and they were about 15 years apart. dont want to add to it lol"
667433,outllaw,2012-02-17 10:36:00,1232,"After the preparations, my top pic would be a woodie minnee mee shad. its a crank that can do double duty. cast or troll wire thu. that way large bass,pike walleyes and muskies."
667439,Gregoire,2012-02-17 12:04:00,1397,As far as lures go I would think about the style of fishing you are planning. If you want only two lures for everything I would recommend a large spinner bait and a an inline spinner. As far a equipment goes your biggest problem would be a net. For musky you either want and extra large basket net or a craddle so that you can keep the fish submerged in water while unhooking it. Other things to consider are extra large pliers and hook cutters. I would take pigeontroller up on his offer as having an experienced angler in the boat is priceless. I know I was so excited and almost shocked after I caught my first ski that I was a bumbling idiot. A big thanks goes out to Fisherpete for helping me. He did everything except pose for a pic and ensured the fish was successfully releases.
667451,Lunkerhunter,2012-02-17 13:53:00,455,"i would also agree with greg on his lure choices if your fishing the kawartha's.  depending on the water your fishing, those 2 lures would change pretty often. also those 2 lures will turn into 20 and then 200 in no time...musky fishing isnt cheap. haha"
667459,Raf,2012-02-17 14:35:00,3495,"a bucktail and a suick have caught fish for over a roy's age and (surprise, surprise) both in some form are attached to two of my rods just about all the time.  if those would be the only two lures available to me, i'd catch fish and do better than skipper in spelling class."
667466,lew,2012-02-17 15:02:00,12766,"I always have at least 3 rods rigged in the boat.  First one has a very large black spinnerbait with orange blades on one rod.  Next rod always has a weighted strawberry Sledge  Third rod always has a bumblebee colored Double ""D""  If one of those baits doesn't catch me a musky in the 1st couple hours it means there's no fish in the lake so  I go home & have lunch."
667570,Joey,2012-02-17 21:23:00,9122, 
667589,Rizzo,2012-02-17 22:34:00,4754,"I like a big white spinnerbait with a big ol twister tail dancing around behind it and I will also suggest a super shadrap in perch flavour. Not the biggest bait but a good place to start. Trolls well, not too heavy to cast and scars up really well when muskies chomp down on it!"
667656,Ron,2012-02-18 02:13:00,1683,"Hook and a Gipsland Earthworm. If I can't get those Australian worms at the local tackle shop, I resort to Sledges and Handlebarz tandem inlines.  Cheers, Ron..."
667698,Gregoire,2012-02-18 12:18:00,1397,I find that you could only catch tigers with gipsland worms. For pure stain muskies I prefer rigging live american eels.
667763,captpierre,2012-02-19 00:02:00,2521,"Don't forget a leader, 12-24 inches.  wire or heavy fluorocarbon leader material.  the best swivel you can buy.  Would piss you off if you finally get on a fish of a lifetime and lose it due to poor terminal tackle.  I find muskies to not be too fussy.  most are caught fishing for other species.  they'll take anything including a minnow or  worm.  hook size is important.  basically the bigger the better.  think about going barbless.  I haven't had the balls but lots  of guys are going barbless."
667792,Weeds,2012-02-19 01:46:00,782,"9 inch weighted Suick, perch pattern black and silver inline spinner (bucktail) with big white Kalins Grub  Don't let the Suicks' looks fool you. I avoided buying one for years; thought they just looked so basic/plain that they couldn't be effective. I was very wrong; I plan on throwing one alot this year."
667894,captpierre,2012-02-19 18:12:00,2521,Have a Suick but have never really given them a real shot.  Exactly how and when do you use them?
667899,lew,2012-02-19 18:21:00,12766," Suicks are an excellent bait Capt and you can use them pretty anywhere muskies hang out, but their deadly over top of the weeds.  Work them real fast with short jerks when the water's warm and when it's cold make them loooong slow pulls with pauses in between.  Those big ole slimers can't resist them."
667914,captpierre,2012-02-19 19:01:00,2521,Thanks Lew.  Mine is out of the box.  I think you weight yours.  How and why?
667922,Tybo,2012-02-19 19:23:00,1373, I'd change up the bucktail for a double cowgirl and spellel litil gooder then skipper.
668154,lew,2012-02-20 11:32:00,12766, I like to make them less buoyant so when you pause the retrieve the bait will hang where it is rather than popping to the surface.  The fish will often hit the Suick as soon as you make the next jerk.  Adding additional weights is very simple  Cut a groove with a chisel    Drop in the weights    Cover with 5 minute epoxy and repaint  No need to be fussy with the paint cause the muskies don't care what it looks like.      Those are small stick-on wheel weights that you can get from any shop that balances wheels.
668168,Gregoire,2012-02-20 13:11:00,1397,"You can also adde weighted hooks. I have never done it, but it is another option."
668172,captpierre,2012-02-20 13:32:00,2521,Thanks Guys.  So cast out onto a weed flat or along a weed edge.  Rip it hard and let it pause?  Twitch it as well?  Is it supposed to mimic and injured fish?
668182,lew,2012-02-20 14:04:00,12766," Yup, just mix it up.  As I mentioned above, work it fast and erratic when the waters warm and slow it down when things cool off in the fall.  It's got an adjustible metal fin on the back that you'll just have to experiment with to get the right flutter and depth you want.  Being a wooden bait each one is a bit different and when they take on water that'll change the action again. Best baits are after they lose some paint and take on even more water and weight.  Their fun baits to work and they produce ALOT of nice fish. Just take the time to experiment and learn their individual idiosincrities."
