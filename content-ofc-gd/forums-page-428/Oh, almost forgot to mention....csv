No Pike.  BUT...   Also NO birdnests on the reel (even after dozens of casts), and I even had my Zara Spook 'walking the dog', although admittedly looking a bit drunk.  Maybe it WAS the equipment?"
678609,mercman,2012-03-22 20:54:00,7054,"Nice going dave !!!!! yup, it was the equipment for sure!!!!! I always knew you could do it man !!!!!"
678624,Christopheraaron,2012-03-22 21:43:00,3525,Woo Hoo!
678635,Rod Caster,2012-03-22 22:10:00,5784,Another good review of the President. Now let's see if the equipment catches you more fish!
678672,Grimace,2012-03-23 00:12:00,2020,Way to go!   Now there is a pain the neck you can scratch off the list.  Great news.
678740,Dave Bailey,2012-03-23 03:12:00,1641,"Thanks gents. I was raised on the old phrase ""a bad workman always blames his tools"", maybe I shouldn't stick to that so rigorously."
678799,Live2fish85,2012-03-23 13:22:00,1633,Way to go Dave. Glad to hear the problems aren't still happening.
