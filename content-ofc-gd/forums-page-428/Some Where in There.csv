678155,solopaddler,2012-03-21 14:09:00,8605,"Wait 'till the sun burns off the fog, take another pic, post it and ask again."
678157,Jer,2012-03-21 14:10:00,1426,"We've had some cool looking fog on the lake here at times the last week or so...  Best thing is, the last of the ice disappeared yesterday."
678158,Skipper D,2012-03-21 14:17:00,1970,"  In that case i might not have to ask again , but i was planning on checking by taking a drive down tonight . This past Sunday when i was there it looked good for this weekend , still hoping that will be so ."
678173,BillM,2012-03-21 15:14:00,17367,"Still ice, drove by it yesterday..."
678176,Rod Caster,2012-03-21 15:28:00,5784," That's not safe, Bill"
678177,NAW,2012-03-21 15:28:00,4022,"Soon Ron.. Soon.  I went for a walk yesterday on my lunch.  Lots of guys shore fishing near the marina.  Another few days of nice weather, and the launch should be good.  Maybe, (big maybe) it will be ready for this weekend."
678181,misfish,2012-03-21 15:44:00,29133," Next week. If you want it gone sooner,you need a good wind with these warm temps.  Im not too concerned though. The river callith this weekend. All weekend.Another weekend work free."
678186,Governator,2012-03-21 16:01:00,879,Took my son to the playground Monday evening at the centennial beach.  There was what looked to be blown in ice that extended probably 60-70' out from the shoreline.
678215,davey buoy,2012-03-21 17:29:00,5505,"Went by Ron,still a thin sheath of ice on the north side,take the southern route and A ok."
678218,BillM,2012-03-21 17:29:00,17367," Whoops, I should have said drove 'by' it yesterday, lol!!!!  All the way from 4th line of Oro back into town.."
678386,NAW,2012-03-22 02:08:00,4022,"Get the boat out Skip..  I drove by at 6pm today, and snapped a few pics for ya!  Few spots with ice floating around, and debris.  I wouldn't be ripping around full throttle.  But a putz over to the perch grounds..Sure        I also get a kick out of the sign posted at the boat launch about the minnows on Simcoe.  They put it there this winter.  The don't plow that parking lot, so even if the ice was good, very few people access the lake from that point"
678390,BillM,2012-03-22 02:15:00,17367,It is absolutely crazy what this weather is doing!  Bring on the jumbos!
