677998,Cudz,2012-03-20 23:39:00,2652,Watching Musky Hunter. THey are fishing Canadian side 2 in boat plus camera man = 3 guysn boat. THey are trolling 6 rods.  Obviously Lake St. Clair allows 2 rods per person?
678000,Handlebarz,2012-03-20 23:44:00,3790,Yes a couple seasons ago we got the second rod for fishing from a boat on LSC and the set up Bob uses is what most of us with smaller boats use it is very easy and keeps the lines away from each other when fishing a musky. I guess the big difference if ya can call it one is I use large wooden home made boards where Bob has the otter boards.

678113,Cudz,2012-03-21 10:19:00,2652,"One more question. Do you have to be trolling to use a second rod or can you, let's say, cast for bass with more than one rod?"
678114,outllaw,2012-03-21 10:21:00,1232,2 rods is legal in l.s.clair as lake erie and ontario and parts of huron. on l.s.c. 96 per-cent of all muskies are released.
678126,Handlebarz,2012-03-21 11:56:00,3790,Yep 2 rods any time from a boat not from shore or wading.
678131,Nipfisher,2012-03-21 12:11:00,2449,  Working 2 rods while wading is just asking for trouble. That would be tough.
678132,Handlebarz,2012-03-21 12:24:00,3790,Cast one stick the other down the back of your pants with a weed less tube or worm lOl when we were kids we waded all the time out on MB over to bass haven cut spot fishing bass what a blast it was
