676707,beginner,2012-03-16 13:44:00,542,nice meow!... I still havent catch that big.. maybe this year
676709,johnnyb,2012-03-16 13:49:00,3413,Great day!  Definitely have your hands full when they get over the 10lb mark
676726,coreyhkh,2012-03-16 14:53:00,163,"I would like to catch a large one in the summer and see how the fight, in the cool water I find they have a lot less energy. In the summer in London I catch small channel cats and they have more power then the large 15+ ones I got in the spring."
676753,uglyfish,2012-03-16 16:05:00,981," the bigger ones dont have as much fight to them as a smaller fish. a 10lb cat will fight harder then a 20lb cat.  u just get more weight to move with the bigger fish, they tend to be more stubborn. like to hold bottom more, and just use their size to work your rod. where as the smaller fish, will shake and run around more on u."
676803,Gerritt,2012-03-16 17:27:00,6129,Good job Mark!  G
676804,Christopheraaron,2012-03-16 17:27:00,3525,Nice!
676812,Moosebunk,2012-03-16 17:46:00,3970,Dunville just got really busy with boats for the weekend. lol.  Some fine fishing dood!
676842,timmeh,2012-03-16 20:05:00,609," I've caught cats close to 20lb and I certainly agree with this. Also I do think water temps play a role too. Despite the nice weather the rivers are still cold, once they warm up a bit I find the fish have a bit more energy.  Nice fish bigworm. They're fun to chase once in a while."
676938,josh,2012-03-17 01:28:00,5,Those are some nice looking cats. I love The grand river catfishin some days its a catfish every cast!

678090,uglyfish,2012-03-21 02:52:00,981,"Yes, canoe on the lower is fine. Just be smart when being up towards the dam"
