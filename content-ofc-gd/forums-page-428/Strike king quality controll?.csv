677562,Lunatic,2012-03-19 17:34:00,536,"while i was at bass pro i picked up 2 kvd squarebill 1.5 silent crankbaits.while i opened up all my goodies i noticed one of the KVD cranks was rudely put together. the one i purchased in bluegill was made in china and the quality and finish looks great.but the other in sexy shad (made in costa rice) looks like it was put together by my 2 year old. the square bill has glue all over it,there is a glue blob on the top rear that was painted over and the paint itself feels like sandpaper.also lots of over spray when putting on the dot and lines. i usually dont complain about things like this because ive had the odd baits from time to time look less than great,but this one is night and day,it really looks like a cheap knock off,of the china model (lol never thought id ever say that something from china was higher standard!) anyone else experience this? beware the costa rica models!"
677579,Dan668,2012-03-19 18:37:00,1120,Yep but it doesn't stop me from buying them. One of my favorite cranks
677673,MCTFisher9120,2012-03-19 21:51:00,3761,Try another brand...won't see things like that. The crankbaits out by Sebile are something else.
677685,BillM,2012-03-19 22:35:00,17367,Take it back and get another.
677687,Lunatic,2012-03-19 22:46:00,536,"I e-mailed them and they want to make it right, even tho I said in the e-mail I wasn't interested in an exchange,just wanted to know what's up, but I'm gonna send it back.they tell me it's probably a bad batch."
677841,singingdog,2012-03-20 10:15:00,1047,"Did you just use ""strike king"" and ""quality"" in the same sentence?"
677885,Garnet,2012-03-20 15:25:00,2056,Mail it back to the company describing the flaws. You usually do very good.
678035,MCTFisher9120,2012-03-21 00:53:00,3761, Yes they do make fine Spinnerbaits. Plastics too
