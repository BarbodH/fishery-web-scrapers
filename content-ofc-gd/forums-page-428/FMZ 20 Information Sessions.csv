678341,Jon,2012-03-22 00:22:00,209,I have seen this on some other boards and was going to post it on the thread about the Ganaraska fishway but thought it was better to post it as its' own topic.  MNR is hosting a series of information sessions on management direction for Lake Ontario. This is your chance to ask questions and provide input into where the management of the lake should be headed.  Times and locations cane be found here: Information Session Details  Some background information on the status of fish communities in the lake can be found at: Lake Ontario Management Unit Home Page  Jon
