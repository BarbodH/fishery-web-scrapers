678378,kickingfrog,2012-03-22 01:50:00,8333,In 6-8 weeks many of us will be sitting in boats fishin' for eyes.  What are the odds we will be freezing and wet?  Thinking longingly for those warm days in March.  Canadian spring eh.
678381,Rod Caster,2012-03-22 02:00:00,5784,I was joking that we might be trading august for march this year. I'd rather a normal season... All my vacations are in august! Ha
678384,limeyangler,2012-03-22 02:04:00,5204,"I'm thinking in 8 days or less i will be casting for walleye from shore and in 2 weeks i will be fishing for them in my boat for a week till it closes.....then on to lake trout, bass and crappie till it opens again...either way i am anticipating open water and boat fishing to start in 2 weeks! I WILL BE OUT IN A BLIZZARD...DONE IT BEFORE...WOULD DO IT AGAIN ANY DAY!"
678387,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-22 02:10:00,10439,I'm anticipating I will be in a boat fishing open water next Wednesday!!! Sure it won't be here but who cares!!!!! Open water fishing starts in late May up here. They're calling for lows in the mid -30's the next few days.

678398,danc,2012-03-22 02:33:00,4677,I've had more May long weekends with freezing temps and snow that I care to remember. There's no reason that this year will be any different.    
678409,bigugli,2012-03-22 03:23:00,6138,"Sown here in Niagara we are 3 weeks ahead. Last year we were 3 weeks behind. It averages out in the end. All I know is my garlic has already shot a good 4"" out of ground and I'm laying weed mats."
