Finally, however, I'm off to Pigeon this weekend for a friendly CPR tourney with some buddies (we just pair up with non-partners so that we can verify the length of eachother's fish, take a quick pick and release them - no one wants to clean any fish this w/e).  Having never fished the lake, I wonder if anyone has any general patterns they could share on Muskies and walleyes in the Kawarthas at this time of year.  Lures/colors, general depths and structure - without, of course, giving up any honey holes!  Also, if there is a general area of the lake that I should focus on (is known to be productive), please do let me know.  Appreciate any feedback and promise to post as soon as I get back.  Best, MoB"

Look for coontail and Milfoil with pockets that will hold fish.  Don't fish over the stuff that looks like a bush that covers the entire bottom (sorry, that is not the technical term).  It seems to not hold fish.  It is thick and has no pockets, just covers the bottom like a blanket.  Light colours have worked well, long profiles in plastics.  6-8+ fow.  Dusk has been good."

Now, I need to make sure that I can execute so that I'm posting fish pics next week instead of a longwinded excuse on why it was the weather's fault that I got... nah, ain't gonna say it....  Thanks again guys, appreciate the shared info!  Cheers,  MoB"
