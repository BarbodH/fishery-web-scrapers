85787,The Urban Fisherman,2007-06-20 01:12:00,2050,"Hey all,  It's been a while for me as I've been swamped with work, getting egnaged and going fishing.  Been trying to read as many reports as possible and I'm glad that many of you are getting out.  I'll try to make this short and sweet....  First off,  I decided to take my boat fund and spend it on a rock.  I proposed to my girlfriend on May 28th, 2007 in Niagara Falls.  Now I need some help!!! We really want to get married at a cottage with a large property, or maybe an INN on the lake.  If anybody has any leads on a Cottage, or INN that might work for a wedding please let us know!  She's been searching the internet for weeks and hasn't come up with much.  Shot from our hotel Room the day of our egagement.   Secondly, I'm proud to announce that I've left my editing job at Technicolor Toronto to work full time for Dave Mercer Outdoors Inc.  I've been doing some editing work for Dave over the past couple of months and he's recently asked me to join the Facts of Fishing team as a full time employee.  Working with Dave hasn't only been a pleasure but huge learning experience.  I've learned more about fishing over the past few weeks than you can imagine.  We recently spent a week in northern Manitoba, where Dave wet a line with this years contest winners.  We were also able to shoot some walleye fishing, and on our down time from shooting I was able to sneak in a little fishing of my own.  Here's my Manitoba Master Angler Walleye.    And my largest pike ever - 37 inches    And Thirdly,  My father was down with his boat for a week so I took him out to Scugog where we hoped to catch our first Muskies.  We tossed big bucktails and spinners all morning.  We caught a few OOS largemouth while trying for muskie, but what suprised me the most was when my Dad got a hit on a giant muskie spinner and pulled a nice Walleye out of the weeds!  Scugog Walleye on a Spinner Bait   We missed one Muskie which hit right at the boat and wasn't hooked for more than 10 seconds, but we had a great day together out on the water anyways.  Thanks for reading my post and Good Fishin' everybody  Cheers, Urban"
