Basically you pay for an energy efficiency evaluation for your home (~$450-$500).  They give your home a score and reccommend improvements to do to improve your score (Eg. Attic insulation, Replace Furnace or AC to high efficient models, seal cracks and drafts, etc) Then you complete whatever improvements you decide and they make a second visit to score your improvements.  Based on that score you qualify for the grants.  Many people are replacing Air conditioning units, furnaces, etc this is a great way to get some money back.  http://www.oee.nrcan.gc.ca/corporate/retro...mary.cfm?attr=4  P.S. The Provincial Gov't has stepped up to match the Federal Gov't grants listed on the website above, dollar for dollar.  So replacing an AC unit says $200, as of now, it's $400.  For even more savings on AC, Furnace, Programmable thermostat check out http://www.coolsavingsrebate.com - Up to $800 in your pocket!  Hope this helps some of you  Tony"

Point being, for myself we are upgrading to those specs anyway, might as well put some money back in our pockets while reducing operating costs for our home at the same time.  Tony"
