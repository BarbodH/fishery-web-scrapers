85819,Coach B,2007-06-20 02:38:00,18,"I knew someone would know, but in creating the album it still says the pics are too big and are not resizing. Am I screwed? I'll try your suggestion Jen - Thanks!"
85825,Jen,2007-06-20 02:59:00,833,"If you are running xp and email the pictures to yourself, it should automatically shrink them.  Worth a shot... then just drag them and drop them back onto your desktop out of the email to create the album!  cheers  Jen"
85834,Coach B,2007-06-20 03:24:00,18,You are GOOD! Couldn't get it on a message but did set up an album. Thanks again. I know they aren't the biggest - but it was fun.
