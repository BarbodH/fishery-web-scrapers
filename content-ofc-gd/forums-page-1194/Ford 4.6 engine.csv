86041,taper,2007-06-20 17:52:00,611,I am looking at purchasing a good used truck for myself and one of the options that has come up is aford but with the small 4.6L . Do any of you have this engine and how do you like it for towing. My boat motor trailer package is coming in around 2500 lbs. I know the motor can pull it but does it work hard doing so? Thanks for the info.

Have towed a couple of heavy trailers moving stuff for people, as well as several 1 ton loads of gravel/ stone (yeah, I realize it is a half ton truck) and haven't had any issue.  Sort of gutless off the line, but it will pull your boat with no issue at all Im sure.  What year is the truck?"
86064,Bernie,2007-06-20 18:53:00,3190,Good motors. Reliable as well. Very few issues with them over the years in my shop. They have been around since the early 90's.
