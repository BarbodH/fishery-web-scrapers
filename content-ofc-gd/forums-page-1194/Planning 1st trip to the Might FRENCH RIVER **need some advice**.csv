86258,DonC,2007-06-21 03:40:00,36,"Addy79,  I do not target musky much anymore, but there are many big ones on the Upper French and Lake Nippissing.  There is plenty of places to troll, so much that you can not cover it all in 2 weeks.  There is deep and shallow trolling.  We have caught musky trolling the Flats, just upstream from Chaudiere Lodge.  There is a topographic may of the French River 6036 I believe and more of Lake Nippissing.  I recommend fishing the area of Sandy Island to the main shore.  It looks like musky heaven there.  I replied to you on the French River Map thread.  Try this link and call them on the phone.  http://public.geoportal-geoportail.gc.ca/c...2F44B669ABB4944  Good luck, Don"
86265,tschirk,2007-06-21 03:50:00,261,"I have been fishing the lower French for 10 years. DO NOT head down to the bay with out a guide and I strongly suggest you go in his boat. As mentioned earlier several people have died including a Native Guide. No way I would take my 'glass boat down there either. If you launch from Hartley Bay, there is hundreds of miles of fishable water without going to the 'Bay. Cheers, T"
86358,addy79,2007-06-21 14:28:00,573,"sounds good, i'll make sure i tear up trolling routes all along sandy island. is the night fishing productive in the river for walleye?? im assuming a jig n minnow would work best."
86362,mattyk,2007-06-21 14:35:00,2110,i have done really well with spinner baits for pike and jig and worms for the eyes and bass.
85697,DonC,2007-06-19 21:24:00,36,"The delta and Bad French sound exciting and has an adventure type feeling whenever I hear them mentioned.  My father started taking the family, 6 sons, to the Pickerel River in 1956, I was not on the first 5 or 6 trips.  We stayed at Camp Wanikeiwin (sp?) the first years, and then camped out on Wanipeitai Bay from then on.  We have never fishing the Bad French to the Delta.  Furthest I have been is past Crombie Bay in the island complex for smallmouth.  Smallmouth is my preferred fish.   I enjoy shallow walleye also.  How is the smallmouth fishing down the Bad French?  Four of us brothers return to the family stomping grounds July 14th, and are talking about the Bad French, but are hesitant and cautious about venturing down there for safety and boat and motor considerations.  My oldest brother has a one year old 18 foot Lund with 60 HP tiller E tec.  Thanks for any recommendations on the fishing and other issues, Don  PS:  After fishing the Lower French, we will again fish the Upper French out of Casa Blanca Lodge."
85718,Big Cliff,2007-06-19 22:28:00,6899,"There is a ton of stuff at the bottom o those rapids from guys saying ""How Bad Can it be!"""
85938,addy79,2007-06-20 13:53:00,573,Are the waters of the upper French suitable to do some trolling? or are there lots of weeds and shallow rocks to get in your way.  I prefer trolling when visiting new bodies of water in an attempt to cover as much water as possible.  When does Musky come into season up there??
85942,RobHall,2007-06-20 13:59:00,261, 3rd saturday in June i believe.  So it's already open.  FOTB 
85964,addy79,2007-06-20 14:47:00,573,"Awesome, I believe that Musky will be our primary target.  Any tips and suggestions on how to target the Musky in the French??"
85967,John,2007-06-20 14:48:00,2956," Trust me, and listen to Cliff, it can be very bad. I fished on the Lower French for quite a few years and each year there was someone, or more than one, who thought how bad can it be and payed the price. Water levels play a big part. I wouldn't even think about it without a guide for the first time and I wouldn't dream about it in a console boat."
85979,addy79,2007-06-20 14:59:00,573,"yeah i think im gonna take heed to everyones advice and stick to the upper french for my first trip.  Musky is on our MINDS!!  any experienced advice would be greatly appreciated..  p.s. my curiosity has been peaked with these rapids, im looking forward to checking em out some time in the future....maybe a kayak fishing trip is in order in the near future??!!"
86016,Zamboni,2007-06-20 16:23:00,235," ""How bad can it be?"" sounds like the Canadian version of ""Hey ya'll watch this"""
86018,Headhunter,2007-06-20 16:25:00,5703,Another potential option would be Georgian Bay Fishing Camp. It is located very close to where the French enters Georgian Bay. Plenty of water to fish. HH
86049,Cast-Away,2007-06-20 18:15:00,790,"It's funny, you are doing the opposite of what I did. I use to fish the lower French from 1985 to 1990 and switched to the Moon River because of the amount of time spent driving the car and the boat and then setting up camp. It became almost a day each way. I love the Moon and go there at least three times a year and know it like the back of my hand. I think that the fishing is much better then the lower French.  Having said that, here is some info on the lower French. There a plenty of great places to camp and alot of water to cover. The first three years we fished the French and Pickeral and launched at Hartley Bay marina. Fishing itself can be hit and miss. It takes a few years to figure out where the good spots are.  The last two years, we launched at the Key River and drove out to Georgian Bay to camp. This was way more fun than fishing in the river because you can do more exploring and fish the mouth of four different rivers along with all of the islands in the area. Again, fishing was hit and miss because you are learning the spots. The down side to this is that the weather can really whip on the bay so you have to be real careful.  Here is a link the charts of the area: Maps  If you decide to fish the lower French in the river, send me a PM as I have the topo's scanned from my hard copy. You can print them off and take them with you. (There are even a few spots marked off for camping and fishing)"
86133,Big Cliff,2007-06-20 21:58:00,6899, You must have a death wish or something LOL. A kayak if you are experienced in white water would be OK going down but you are going to have to carry it back up.
86203,addy79,2007-06-21 00:44:00,573,LOL I gotta check out these rapids! They sound worse than the Ottawa river!!
