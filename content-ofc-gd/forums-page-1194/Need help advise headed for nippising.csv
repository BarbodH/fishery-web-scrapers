86197,buckeye_boy,2007-06-21 00:12:00,3,Hey everone. Newbie here headed for Lake nippising on his first trip to Ontario. Going to Callander bay June 23 for a week and hope to catch some nice pike. I hear callander bay is a great pike location. Any ideas or hints would make this trip awsome. Also a few walleye thrown in would be nice. What lures work the best for pike this time of year. Shallow or deep.......... As you can tell I really need help. Thanks

GO BUCKS   OH----------------IO!!!!!!!"
