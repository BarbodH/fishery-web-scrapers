86164,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-20 22:51:00,0,"Well said. I second that.People say we are fighting for freedom?(Bull) We are fighting Terrorism?(B.S.)  From what I hear there are huge gas reserves in Afghan and they are also planning to build a pipeline from Turkey to India. Not to mention to control the opium trade. And no not for the Heroin but for the pharmecudical companies.  If you look at the markets. Pharmecudicals(and of coarse energy) are making a killing. Therefore they need alot of opium to feed the demand.  Apparently Osama and the Taliban were able to completely stop the poppy farming. Yet with Nato there, they are unable?  And Iraq? Can you say oil????  Also apparently Bush sr and Osama were business partners within the Carlyle group. Something smells fishy. Not all is what it seems."

They are doing us proud, but they are literally being used for target practice, they have to follow civilized rules to respond . . . .     the terrorists have NO rules!"
86191,Terry,2007-06-20 23:49:00,14456,well I still believe if we don't fight them there we will fight them here.......
86200,ecmilley,2007-06-21 00:22:00,2163,an actual comittment from our federal goverment on military spending to equio our troops with new weapon technologys would go a long way to protecting them

In the interest of harmony and since we all know that this will turn a bit heated, let's instead focus on the first day of summer and bass season."
