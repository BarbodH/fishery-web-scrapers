It shows the action of the Johnson Silver Minnow that a lot of the northern Lodges recommend... and I can see why now.. It's tipped with a small plastic minnow.  I know I'm going to be using that setup a bit more!!  CLICK HERE TO VIEW

85998,TennesseeGuy,2007-06-20 15:26:00,957,Nice.  First time I realized how sexy a JSM can be.  Nice movement.  How do you fasten the fishing line to your camera cable?  Does it break away when a fish hits?
86001,TJQ,2007-06-20 15:34:00,7806, TG... lol..  Id tell but id have ta....  and I fish with all barbless hooks... the intent it to get the hit... not so much the fish on....
86003,fishnsled,2007-06-20 15:37:00,3520,  Just when you think you've heard every excuse for loosing a fish.....
86006,TennesseeGuy,2007-06-20 15:46:00,957,"TJ, I was thinking about fastening my line to the camera cable with a small rubber band that would break loose when a fish hits the lure.  How's that sound?  First I need to find some clear water to fish."
86022,Terry,2007-06-20 16:36:00,14456,I was thinking about how to do it too I thought the downrigger release clips would do the best job I will have to play and see what I can make work
