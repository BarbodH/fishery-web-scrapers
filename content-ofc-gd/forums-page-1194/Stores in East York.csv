All the rest,published i the internet,are gone. I was looking for carp bait(boilies,rigs or baiting needles)-no luck  . I'd appreciate if anyone can help me with some info! Thanks!  JimmyZ"
86070,ccmtcanada,2007-06-20 19:05:00,7971,"My local tackle shop in Oshawa (Gagnon's Sports) is also pretty much sold out of carp stuff.  Last I heard, Tightlines in Pickering still had a limited stock."
86106,MJL,2007-06-20 20:27:00,2427,"If you can't find any, you can make your own boillies, rigs and baiting needles.  Some stores you might want to check out (In no particular order) - Fishing World - Angling Specialties - FishOnlineCanada - Tightlines  A little birdy told me that KTL, the supplier to many stores in the GTA is having problems getting Nash and DAM tackle from overseas.  Inventory is currently on backorder with very little tackle coming in the foreseeable future.  You can always order tackle online www.wackerbaits.com www.carpins.ca"
86125,Victor,2007-06-20 21:21:00,1609,to add to MJL's list ...  for GTA stores you can also try FishingSport.  and  www.royalcarp.com www.scorpiontackle.com www.bigcarptackle.com  for online suppliers
86217,JerseyDog,2007-06-21 01:28:00,190,"I thought the CTC on Danforth at Main had carp stuff. Maybe not, but I thought I saw it there."
86227,BFSC Kevin,2007-06-21 02:13:00,1351,not many stores in this part of town with fishing supplies.. sadly.
86250,jimmyz,2007-06-21 03:16:00,7,"Thanks for the info,guys! I'll try some of these sites and order on-line. Unfortunately, there are no many carp-tackle stores not only in my area, but in the whole GTA. Hope some day things will change! JimmyZ"

86268,jimmyz,2007-06-21 03:57:00,7,"Sure! Thanx ,I'll call them tomorrow JimmyZ"

Fish Sport has some and the prices are good, but the main stream stuffs you have to go to Fishing World (Hamilton), Angling Specialty (Scarborough), or Fish On Line (Jane/Lawrence). And please don't buy hair rigs...just make them yourself.  Those U.S. online stores have tons of stuffs with reasonable price, the problem is the shipping and tax and custom charge... If you can have a trip to U.K., that's where you can really get the good stuffs."
