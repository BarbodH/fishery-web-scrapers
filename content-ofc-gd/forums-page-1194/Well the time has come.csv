Well there are still a few other things to get organized besides the beer but I'm almost ready.  We will be leaving at 2am Friday morning and driving to Cochrane.  From there we will be flying into Floodwood Lake for some walleye and pike fishing until Tuesday.  With all the great reports coming in from the area we are bound to have a great time.  A buddy of mine was in at the same lake a few weeks ago and they had over 800 walleye between 4 guys during their stay. As well as a few accidental pike and a couple of whitefish while fishing for the eyes.  Watch out for the report next week.  For those going to Lakair - have a FANTASTIC time and be safe!
