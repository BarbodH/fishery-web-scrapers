85869,DonC,2007-06-20 11:17:00,36,"You can obtain from the Canadian Hydrographic Society or commercial outlets off the internet topographic maps of the Upper French River and Lake Nippissing.  They are producing a water proof version now.  Try these links.  http://www.fishingmap.com/ontario/    This one may not have the French River, but you can call them.  Below is the government site that I have ordered non-waterproof maps from, and then had them laminated.  http://public.geoportal-geoportail.gc.ca/c...2F44B669ABB4944  Scroll down to French River.  Good luck,  Don"
