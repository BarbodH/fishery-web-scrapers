So far, the Cannon Mag 10 HS has caught my eye, but I am open to others ( if the price is right ). Anyone seen any deals or have a friend of a friend . . . . . . . . . . .  Thanks for any help and direction that anyone can add.  Should note that I am looking for electrics with long boom  Thanks again Don   "
