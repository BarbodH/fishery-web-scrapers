85810,Rich,2007-06-20 02:08:00,3927,Well my boss from work and I went out to try our luck at some perch today after the storms. I guess nobody invited the perch. We gave it about 2 hours and managed only a sheephead and a small channel cat for our troubles. It was still good to get a little pull in the line again.. its been a while. Cant wait for bass opener!
