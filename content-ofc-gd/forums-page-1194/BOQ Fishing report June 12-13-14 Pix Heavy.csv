85480,superdad,2007-06-19 14:54:00,353,"Last Tuesday, the 12th was the first day of the fishing with my son, SuperDave and his bros in law and sons visiting from the 'Show Me State'  Missouri.  They are experiened fishers with an assortment of different Catfish, LM Bass and crappies. They have a pond on their property that has seen 10 lb LM Bass being caught and the younger son - Brett is a keen fisher who regularly lands 5 to 8 lbers.  The fishing in Canada is a totally new experience for them and they were anxious to land walleye and pike.  The young lad was keen and I rigged a rod with a hook and a bobber for some perch and sunfish off the dock. Within minutes of fishing off the dock, he landed several LM bass, ranging from 1lb to 3lbs. He was happy to  break the ice for his first Canadian fish.  We were able to get Tuesday after supper for a couple hours and we headed to Thompsons Cove for some trolling. Began the troll in 14' adn shortly thereafter, Brett had a strike and was able to land his first Walleye. He was a happy camper.    We trolled the weed line and began a turn, which took us out over 19' of water and on that turn, the older lad - Ryan had a strike and fought a real nice fish - 4.75 lbs of Quinte Walleye.    We started the trip off with a couple of fish and following the previous weekend when the fishing had dropped off, we felt lucky to have taken those fish.  On Wednesday, we headed out to troll some deeper water looking for some suspended fish, but the East wind make the trolling difficult, but we were able to get another first for the boys from MO.    We changed locations and trolled near Q6 along the shoal and SuperDave landed his first walleye of the year. Not a big fish but enough to give him a tussle on his ultra-light rod.    We continued fishing there and shortly thereafter, the Bros in Law-Scott hooked into his first Walleye ever. Not a big fish, but a walleye all the same.    On our way back to Bayview, we decided to make a couple of passes at Thompsons again as we had been lucky the previous evening. We started trolling and Scott's rod bent  with another fish, this was a really nice 4 lber.    The Lake Gods were on our side - everyone was happy as everyone was getting fish.  We hadn't caught a pike yet, so for the evening fish, we trolled the north shore of Hay Bay with a Red Swan Gold Wobbler and finally in front of BayBoys place Brett hit a really nice pike- His Quinte Grand Slam was complete - Bass-Walleye & Pike.    Everything was working well, and we were catching fish also - can't ask for more than that.  Off to fish on Thursday, we headed to Green Point as we saw some different parts of Quinte. We landed a couple of 12-13"" fish up there and decided to head back down Long Reach to an area where I had marked some fish on Tuesday AM. They weren't biting but the troll took us over to Shermans Pt and when we cut across the shoal into the shallower water and weed line, we started hitting some fish. Ryan was the first to get one and it was a surprise.    The fish were biting and we continued to troll back and forth and during the next 75 minutes, we landed 11 walleyes, mostly in the 13-14"" size. Size doesn't matter for young lads having a ball hooking fish and tangling lines and feeling the weeds pulling like walleyes.  We had quite a morning with 13 fish landed - all hands were happy with those results. On our way back, we met the C/O and OPP who checked our licenses, livewell and coolers. We had ALL the safety equipment and more than was asked for. Please remember to carry your boat registration with you - it's important.  For the final evenings fish, we stayed close to Bayview and fished the shoal and Wagon Wheel Point, Brett was hot as he landed three more small walleyes and as the sun was setting we turned towards the dock and his rod REALLY bent over...... was this the BIG walleye - Don't think so as I saw the line circling in the water as he had his hands full with the rod doubled over. Five minutes later, the net answered the question - Walleye or Sheepshead?????    Quite the fish to end the first trip to Canada - pulled like crazy and that's half the sport of fishing - fighting the big one - regardless of species.  The final count of the fishing was over 24 walleyes, several bass(released) a pike and a couple of sheepshead. The visitors from Missouri were happy with the fish and the chance to see the fabulous Bay Of Quinte.  I was very happy to have lead them to the fish and all the walleyes and sheepshead were caught on the Fabulous UZICK Spinner (Chratreuse and Orange).  I am sure this trip north will whet their appetite for another adventure of Canadian fishing."
