85042,douG,2007-06-18 17:58:00,2693,"Joey's jerky is the second best jerky I've tasted, with #1 being the Noelville butcher's."
85049,ccmtcanada,2007-06-18 18:06:00,7971," Joey...actually, with all the Carp Bly and I have been catching, we are experimenting with a new concoction....  What does everyone think of.....  CARPCAKES????  Not sure what's in it yet, but we figured between our catches and the stuff washing up on Scugog, that we'd have lots for everyone to eat.  "
85050,John,2007-06-18 18:07:00,2956,Joey's Jerky............sounds like a business opportunity to me............
85054,Roy,2007-06-18 18:13:00,13728,Joey's Juicy Jerky would fetch more customers though.
85060,John,2007-06-18 18:19:00,2956,Juicy jerky...........that's one to chew on.........
85067,Joey,2007-06-18 18:30:00,9122,Joey's Juicy Jerky  and  Cliff's Carp Cakes     Are we there yet.......  Joey
85210,Beans,2007-06-18 22:50:00,3339,I could put together a pretty mean bean salad from a favorite recipe but do you think it would be a safe thing to do ???  My niece didn't want me to make one for our trip to her place as long as Uncle Dave was coming...No explanation required...
85213,motv8tr,2007-06-18 23:00:00,2587,"  NOOOOOOO..  ..unless of course you want to sleep outside, then bring all you want  Maureen"
85258,Joey,2007-06-19 00:32:00,9122,"Beans' beans!!!  Now these I gotta try, bring em for sure  Joey"
85315,motv8tr,2007-06-19 02:16:00,2587,"Now Joey, don't go getting carried away, unless you want to have him share your tent...remember, I'm stuck in the cabin with him  Maureen"
85921,Beans,2007-06-20 13:20:00,3339,I can't seem to locate the recipe...maybe just as well...probably take Kevin and Leslie a week to air out the campgrounds and cabins...
