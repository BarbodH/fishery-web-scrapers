I'll be happy the day ever soldier, Canadian, British, US and the rest of them come back home where they belong.  But I support our troops and think its total idiocy for the socialists in Toronto to even consider removing those decals.  Sometimes you gotta pick sides, and I will always side with Canada (and the US), no matter what my personal politics."

86155,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-20 22:38:00,0, The extremists say things like that and only after they were provoked by the war. How many infidels did the Taliban kill in Canada or the USA for that matter before 9/11??  This is all hype. They get a few crazies on TV and make it seem like they are all out to kill us.They want to be left alone and leave us alone.They dont want their way of life disturbed.  The basically want the infidels off their land.
