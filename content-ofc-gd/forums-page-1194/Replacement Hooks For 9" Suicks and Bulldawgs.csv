85789,Andy,2007-06-20 01:14:00,330,"If anyone has a moment, I was wondering what size and brand of hook you like to use when replacing the trebles on 9"" Suicks and shallow Bulldawgs. I am also looking to buy a pair of Knipex bolt cutters (I understand they are the best) and was wondering if anyone in Ontario or Canada sells them. Thx in advance, Andy."
85793,Roy,2007-06-20 01:26:00,13728,"I use 4/0 Mustads on a 9"" Suick. Can't tell you about the Bulldawg cause I don't have any. Sorry."

85914,tonyb,2007-06-20 13:14:00,1637,"Check these out if you are looking to replace hooks, makes life easy!  Gamakatsu Magic Eye Treble Hooks   ""The eye on the Magic Eye Treble has a special shape that is designed to open split rings. The top portion of the eye has a tapered flat portion that easily fits between the wires of the split ring and with one little twist, separates them and the hook slides right on. Simply push the hook onto the split ring while, at the same time, pushing the old hook off. Thereâ€™s no need to dig around looking for split ring pliers anymore. In addition to the unique design of the eye, the Magic Eye Treble features everything else anglers have come to expect from Gamakatsu like three sticky sharp points and very strong steel."""

85961,bigbuck,2007-06-20 14:40:00,2449,"I'll second theringlord.com, they were quick and there was no cross border duties and such. As for the hooks, I know that JBs Fishing Depot carries all of the big Mustad hooks for muskie lures. I'd check there."
