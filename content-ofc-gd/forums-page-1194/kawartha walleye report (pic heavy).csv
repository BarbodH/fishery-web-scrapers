85605,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-19 19:02:00,0,Nice!!!Your lucky to have a good fishing partner during the week. I also like the rubber net. Do the hooks still get stuck to the rubber and doesn't it get damaged???
85616,kennyman,2007-06-19 19:18:00,737,Beauty fish. What Lake? What bait were you using? Hard to see in the pic. Looks like something red?
85630,Matt15,2007-06-19 19:33:00,107,Nice Fish and great weather
85635,fishnsled,2007-06-19 19:40:00,3520,There's some good fishing!  Nice report!    Hey JB - I've been using a rubber net for 6 years now and never had a problem with the hooks damaging the netting.
85640,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-19 19:47:00,0," Thanks! Some times it takes me a while getting the hook and fish freed from the net!!And it also mangles the lures. Some one gave me a new frabill, although I still use my old mangled up net with shoe lace, stitch job.lol  But the next one will definately be rubber!"
85641,shawnf,2007-06-19 19:50:00,46,"Great catch guys! Keep the photo's comin'.  BTW - When I was fishing on Lake Erie, just so happens that our guide was using rubber nets. Don't know that means anything, but he sure seemed like he knew his stuff."
85647,snagmaster,2007-06-19 19:53:00,250,yeah JB for th last two years ive been using the rubber net and its great....never damaged or tanled yet.....had much more tangles with the oldschool nets and the rubber ones dont hurt the fish as much...ahhhhh bass opener is around the corner ....where you planning fro opener??
85671,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-19 20:28:00,0," Haven't decided yet. My friend wants to go back to Chandos, which I really dont want to but he is in a slump and I will take him if he likes. There was alot of good bass structure but we weren't targetting them, so who knows. Plus I might nail a trophy pike!!"
