86347,tonyb,2007-06-21 14:11:00,1637,Try sending a PM to 'Darrell' on gettinghooked forums.  I believe he has a buddy that is in the spray foam insulation trade.  Tony

Build the compartments with good drainage if your using foam, plan so that the foam stays dry. Go to iboats and read on boat restoration forum-do a search on foam.....I'm against it in restorations-seen too many boats with 300-600 lbs of water in the 'flotation' foam. Neutral buoyancy?  Tore the foam out of Whaler I'm restoring- may go the 2 litre pop bottle route with little foam to stop rattling when time comes-tuff call."
