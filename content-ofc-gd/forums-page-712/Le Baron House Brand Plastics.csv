However, I recently purchased some of the Le Baron house brand plastics - shad and grubs.  I grabbed some 3"" Shad Minnows because I have been looking for some Mister Twister Sassy Shads but could only find one color; and I liked the hot pink color of their grubs.  I was wondering if anyone has any experience with them?  In particular the 3"" Shad Minnow and the 3"" Curl Tail Grubs.  Couldn't find much information on them on the internet.  I am sure the grubs will work fine, but the action of the various brands of paddle tail baits is all over the map.  Thanks."
