444600,pikehunter,2010-03-17 11:20:00,1659,"Flip a coin,   it won't be wrong. All are fine machines. Just pick a decent reliable dealer. Enjoy your new motor"
444608,Steve,2010-03-17 12:02:00,2075,"CO2 Inflatables in Oakville (Dorval Dr) - Best small yamaha outboard guys around (less than 115hp).  They were by far the best price and service when i bought my 60hp four stroke Yammy. (last year).  Variable trolling control is what makes the yammy superior.  Btw, I live in Hamilton, on the mountain, if that's a hint."
444613,solopaddler,2010-03-17 12:22:00,8605,Yamaha because of the variable trolling feature and reliability. After researching thoroughly I bought my 40hp tiller last year from Hastings. They gave me by far the best deal.
445376,PERCHER,2010-03-19 12:14:00,787,MikethePike your motor of choice last year was Honda and nothing but.There was no talking you out of it.NO way no how.You cant just flip engine loyalty over night and have nothing nice to say about the first motor.That's why I say Yamaha or Merc and not always in that order.If i was a 4 stroke it would be a very tough decision but if it was a 2 stroke I would say Mercury Optimax HANDS DOWN>>Now don't always beleive what YOUR dealer says..... Just my unvalid 2 cents worth of jibber. Dan
445377,bushart,2010-03-19 12:19:00,2628,I bought my 50 merc 4 stroker new in 96-------been excellent------tons of hours---do the maintenance though  Bushart
445408,hirk,2010-03-19 13:49:00,571,"I don't have a ""loyal brand"" myself but when it comes to motors you will find depending on HP that some offer advantages over others.In the range your shopping for the  biggest thing to look for is cubic inch displacement and number of cylinders (and any specific model problems),these two things = torque/performance,get the v-4.Dealers to service is pretty important too,I would be very concerned buying a Suzuki/Honda and Yammy for that reason depending on where you live."
445493,sconceptor,2010-03-19 17:22:00,146,"Dale,  I take it you've been to TommyBoy Yahama/G3 dealership in Owen Sound sinces it's right close to you.  What did you think?  Seem like good deals on some ATVs.  I asked how much spring tune up on my 2002 25hp 4 stroke Yahama would be and service said around $300.  I thought that was a little out there.  My boat is from Grand Bend, Southwest Marine.  They might be worth a call, they sell Yahama and Crestliners?  I've tried to email them, but no response in 2 days, so who knows about them.  You're putting together a sweet ride!!!!!  I love the tillers, but little experience with a side console.  Slow trolling them is so nice, and the extra space comes in handy(carrying all the cases of beer for the guys on a week long fishing trip at a back roads lake).  You'll be rocking it up north on those phenomenal lakes with a motor like that and the size of your boat.  I need to head up there someday for a week or more!"
445535,brkygetr,2010-03-19 19:52:00,425," Everyone does my fellow Bruceian, everyone!!!!!! And yes i checked them out."
443534,brkygetr,2010-03-14 00:05:00,425,"Ok I have searched, searched, talked and called enough. If you had to put a new tiller on your 17.5'  Crestliner Fishhawk what would it be? I am really leaning towards a Suzuki or a Yammy 4...but the Etec is also calling to me (and the dealer is local). Do I flip a coin or what? Not really a Merc guy but have never owned one either. And I am talking 75-90 hp, preferably on the high end. Any help folks?  Dale"

443545,brkygetr,2010-03-14 00:39:00,425, G..you have a same class motor???? reason I ask is I hear a-lot about the higher hp motors but little about the lower hp Etec's. (mayhaps thats cause no one has any problems with them????)
443551,Dara,2010-03-14 00:49:00,3052,"Yamaha without a doubt.  Read, Variable trolling System.  http://www.yamaha-motor.ca/products/produc...up=O#contentTop  I hit a button on my 60 and it changes the rpm's in 50 rpm increments up or down. Great for adjusting and getting back to the right trolling speed."
443553,hockeyplayerz_14,2010-03-14 00:51:00,160,yammy for sure
443556,Bigfisherman,2010-03-14 00:54:00,100,ETEC!!!!!!!
443564,Pigeontroller,2010-03-14 01:08:00,2793,The new 70 hp Yamaha 4 stroke is apparently significantly lighter than the 75 was...I'd look into it.
443565,Pigeontroller,2010-03-14 01:12:00,2793,"Wow, just checked the Yamaha website! New 70 hp 4stroke is 260 lbs vs. 75 hp at 369lbs.   http://www.yamaha-motor.ca/products/produc...up=O#contentTop"
443571,brkygetr,2010-03-14 01:29:00,425, Yeah i got a buddy that has a 50 with the same system and I fished with him last fall and it rocked.... I loved the tiller control...trim/tilt and troll down at the flick of a hand...we could troll at .9 mph..it is a consideration for sure.

443629,Sinker,2010-03-14 04:06:00,8692,"Go for the  yammy. I think there is a way to get a 70hp, to be a 90hp........you'll have to look it up, but I did read that somewhere.  S."
443630,moemoe,2010-03-14 04:07:00,352,"Yamaha, all the way, haven't had one major issue with mine, I have had good luck with johnson/evinrude and honda's that I have owned, but thumbs down to merc 4 strokes, the older ones anyways, I haven't heard one bad issue from a verado owner"
443657,musky66,2010-03-14 13:08:00,273,Love my Yamaha 115 fuelie- no issues at all in 7 years.
443660,Steve,2010-03-14 13:30:00,2075,everything is compared to a yammy for a reason.  nothing beats a Yamaha. (head to the niagara river in the winter for your lund/yamaha party)
443665,lew,2010-03-14 13:46:00,12766,"I ran a 90 HP Merc 4 str. for 8 years on a Crestliner and it was absolutely flawless without even 1 single issue.  Last year I got a new boat with a 150 Yamaha 4 str. and after being on the water nearly every day of the season, with many miles on her, that motor was also flawless and I have no doubt that trend will continue for many years.  Just my opinion, but I think the entire crop of current motors are good, including both the E-Tech and Suzuki your also considering."
443669,Mike the Pike,2010-03-14 13:54:00,3421," I second it I have the same motor 60hp tiller with variable trolling button.  Oh my buddy has the 60hp  Mercury its a 2006 last season in 2009 he had to change a coil already.My dealer sells Yamaha,Honda,Suzuki and now Mercury he says he has changed several coils on Mercury motors so far.  I had a Suzuki motor in the past yes they have a good reputation but if you need parts in a hurry forget it often back order from Japan.  I hit my prop one summer needed a new prop shaft it was back order from Japan for over 3 weeks I was boatless for my vacation.  BTW Yamaha sells the most outboard motors world wide!!!!"
443672,brkygetr,2010-03-14 14:04:00,425,"keep the opinions coming folks...as a side note anyone have a particular Yammy shop they deal with in southern Ontario??? Not in Toronto, prefer to deal with a little guy?????"
443673,Pigeontroller,2010-03-14 14:10:00,2793,"Bay City Marine in Hamilton, Doug and Clarence Nagtegal."
443676,Spiel,2010-03-14 14:13:00,9065," That's where I got mine. 2006 Lund with a 4 stroke 75 Mec tiller. Can't offer any personal opinions on the other brands as I've not used them, but thus far my Merc has been an absolute pleasure to own."
443680,lew,2010-03-14 14:17:00,12766,"I've dealt with Paris Marine north of Peterboro for 20 odd years and have always had good service from them, and I bought my new rig from Hastings Marine in Hastings and so far they been good too."
443686,Sinker,2010-03-14 14:28:00,8692,"Yep, call hastings marine. Thier prices are usually hard to beat, and they have a great reputation.  S."
