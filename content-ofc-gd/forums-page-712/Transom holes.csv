444503,HTHM,2010-03-16 23:38:00,4082,I just de-rigged my blown Yamaha as was wondering what I should do to the transom holes as they are going to be open for a couple months.  I was thinking that i should fill them with epoxy and/or drill them larger and put in pvc bushings. Any advice???
444505,Dutch,2010-03-16 23:42:00,831,Fill them with a good epoxy.
444534,Fisherman,2010-03-17 01:25:00,7201,"Nut & bolt with a rubber washer on each side, lot easier to remove than dried in epoxy or other goop.  Make the washers from and old piece of tire tube or use fender washers with a garden hose washer under it, guaranteed no leaks."
444568,hirk,2010-03-17 03:09:00,571,"Wouldn't do anything Albert,any moisture will air dry.It's not being submersed."
444739,SlowPoke,2010-03-17 19:00:00,2984,"I'm with Hirk.. leave 'em. But.... a whacky thought came to mind if you feel like messing with it. Tape over the hole on the outside of the transom. On the inside, tape over 3/4 of the hole and fill the cavity with rice. Rice will draw moisture out of the transom!"
444742,JohnF,2010-03-17 19:07:00,3494, Great minds etc. Except I hadn't thought of the rice. I was still trying to think of something that would absorb the water. Rice is good.  JF
444752,Billy Bob,2010-03-17 19:35:00,5865,And at the end of the day when you didn't catch anything at least you have the rice to eat...
444766,Radnine,2010-03-17 20:23:00,1538,"  In my opinion as a boat expert, the rice will absorb the water and expand and the transom will break off entirely Jim"
444775,JohnF,2010-03-17 21:08:00,3494, I suspect that's why he suggested sealing up only one end.  JF
444789,JPD,2010-03-17 22:09:00,296,"Just tape them over and it will be fine, if you really are concerned fill them with silicone which can easily be removed after without damaging the holes.  Never drill out your existing transom holes and never use bushings since they will wear quickly and give the motor movement which will eventually lead to oval holes. Once that happens you will be in more trouble than if you ever got a bit of moisture in them to begin with.  If you are super worried, get a small can or spar varnish and a small brush and coat the exposed wood. That will prevent any moisture from entering.  JP"
444806,HTHM,2010-03-17 23:00:00,4082,"I am not super worried, I am HYPER worried. I have one hole that is a little bit oval now, and do not want to make it get worse by negleting it"
444816,aniceguy,2010-03-17 23:19:00,1094,a slightly oval hole can get corrected when you re rig the engine without having to reglass it.  A trasom stiffener and epoxy solves it.
444919,SlowPoke,2010-03-18 08:12:00,2984," LMAO!!! If the transom 'breaks off entirely' before the tape peels off, I think Albert would thank me for that suggestion and rid himself of theat boat. Never underestimate the power of rice"
444930,PERCHER,2010-03-18 10:50:00,787,1bolt and 2 drain plug washersers.If oil wont leak out water shure wont leak in.
444959,OhioFisherman,2010-03-18 12:42:00,6623,I keep unwanted items away from my transom.
444969,Radnine,2010-03-18 13:04:00,1538,"  Remember your high school geography, how many of our lakes and indeed our very land formations were created by retreating rice during the rice age. Albert, when that transom falls off you will feel like a right rice hole. Jim"
445013,vinnimon,2010-03-18 15:33:00,2593,"Sham wow,and if you call within ten minutes you get the extras"
445020,vinnimon,2010-03-18 15:42:00,2593,"Albert, if you decide to rebush the holes,use the right stuff for sealant.Its a little pricey but well worth it.If you need brass or sealant come by,Im sure I can help you out.Ill rummage through my stuff again.Another clean up is due."
445453,SlowPoke,2010-03-19 15:35:00,2984,"Since you're up on geo/ecological issues, do you mind explaining how aerosol cans are destroying the earth's calzone?"
