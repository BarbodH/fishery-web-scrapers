427250,4thgen,2010-01-29 16:03:00,157,"  This one was 38"" with a pretty big girth, although I forget what it was now. The biggest that I've caught was 41"" but the picture hasn't been scanned. I'm pretty sure that I've seen them over 50lbs in Lake O. Back around 2000 a friend has his picture in the Toronto Star with a 55lb carp from the islands."
444690,mike rousseau,2010-03-17 16:24:00,4661,YES!  ive seen several carp in the 50lb range on the st.lawrence river near cornwall ontario and every year you hear about a carp angler landin a high 40-50lber
444727,ch312,2010-03-17 18:25:00,1590,nobody has mentioned nanticoke yet?  ive seen quite a few huge carp there over the years.
444779,solopaddler,2010-03-17 21:35:00,8605,East outflow of the Pickering nuclear plant in the dead of winter. There are carp swimming around there much larger than 50lb's.

444830,OhioFisherman,2010-03-17 23:49:00,6623,"Sandusky Bay Lake Erie, Ohio side, by the third bridge under the Cedar Point causeway. My buddy got one between 50 and 60 pounds on a tube, we probably would never have landed it if we weren`t in a boat and could follow it with the electric motor. Mid April before they put a closed season on smallies here, we caught 3 that day, one around 25, one around 35, and the sow.  Lot f pigs in the bay, and it is usually pretty easy to spot where they are feeding, they get the water muddy rooting up the bottom. Hoovers, the suck up anything and eat it, catch them on lures all the time there, worms minnows. They aren`t too particular, not much shore access in the bay, a boat is the best way to fish it. April is a good time because the water is cold and they can be a bit sluggish. Just west of there in west harbor we have watched netters pull in their commercial nets with some real pigs. They clean them and smoke them and send them to NYC."
444855,JPD,2010-03-18 00:28:00,296,"I have caught 2 pretty close in size that I have been amazed with... never weighed either but would assume high twenties to somewhere in the 30 lb range. one from Lake Erie, a 37"" Mirror:   This was a 38"" Island Carp   But I saw plenty that dwarf these examples in both the Islands and Lake Erie!"
444880,hammercarp,2010-03-18 01:58:00,964,Wow! That is a cool mirror JPD. Thanks
444954,OhioFisherman,2010-03-18 12:30:00,6623,"LMAO, no known photographic records of me holding a carp, or a sheephead. LOL Whopper looks good holding sheepheads, I need a prettier fish."
445027,vinnimon,2010-03-18 15:58:00,2593,Selkirk my friend in the summer back in the late 80s early 90s. A wopping 52 1/2 lb on a 6ft berlky power poll.Everyone went back for lunch and I held back for a few minutes due to a bite on the rod.I caught the biggest carp in my life and at the same time missed some good Italian cooking.  Sorry no picks but a few in the hammer can vouch for that day.Took me well over an hour to land it on 8lb test.
445191,hammercarp,2010-03-18 23:34:00,964,Vinnimon. Was it in the mouth of the creek?
445432,troutboy,2010-03-19 14:45:00,125,"When I was fishing south of Penticton BC on vacation,I had a large fish on.I got her close to shore and it was a HUGE carp,she ended up breaking off!"
445445,hammercarp,2010-03-19 15:16:00,964,"Troutboy, PM sent."
445461,hunterjoe84,2010-03-19 16:09:00,52,"If you wanna see some real giants, they feed them in the Otonabee river at the zoo in Peterborough.  You cant fish there but there are definitly some pushing 50 lb.  Mirrors and Commons.  I fish the Otonabee a lot and my biggest so far is 30lb."
423593,hammercarp,2010-01-18 18:19:00,964,Has anyone here ever seen a carp that they thought would be pushing the 50 lb. mark? Where did you see it? What time of year was it?
423596,purekgw,2010-01-18 18:24:00,585,"i have seen a few 40+ for sure out of hamilton harbor in the spring, the place is loaded with them"
423599,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-18 18:27:00,10439,"Back in the 80's I caught one that weighed 55# at the lakeview generating station in either May or June. Somewhere I have a picture of it floating around, I'll have to try and find it sometime."
423604,hammercarp,2010-01-18 18:44:00,964,I would appreciate it.
423612,uglyfish,2010-01-18 19:14:00,981,biggest i ever seen caught was outta hammy harbour that was 48 1/2 lbs. cant remember the exact spot but that fish was a monster. had a pic of it but when i had my computer go nuts i lost all the pics i had.
423615,FUSION,2010-01-18 19:29:00,81,Quick google search found these...   
423618,Fang,2010-01-18 19:32:00,1330,"Same place as Drifter, I saw one that measured just under 46"". It had been snagged in the back with a salmon spoon. This was just after they had shut the stacks down at Lakeview. Now I would bet on St Lawrence or Niagara for the big guys as well as Hamilton harbour but more towards the lake. Tend to see a bit bigger fish caught closer to the lake. We saw tons of carp this year cruising back around the marinas in HH but they all tended to be smaller than ones I see in Lake Ontario.  I know there's some really big brutes cruising Bronte and 16 mile river mouth but never seen anytone catching them."
423620,tightline,2010-01-18 19:39:00,322,I've seen plenty of monsters lurking around promenade park in Etobicoke...not sure how much they would have weighed but a few I've seen had shoulders as broad as mine!!
423621,tightline,2010-01-18 19:40:00,322,look at the freaking eyeballs on that thing....creepy!!
423623,gbaysteel,2010-01-18 19:55:00,13,A few friends and i have a few spots that produce 30pound plus carp for about two weeks in early june. The rest of the summer you would lucky to catch one over 20. We fish carp for only a few days a year when the giants are in the bay to spawn and have never seen another person target theese fish. It's common for us to hook 50 fish in a morning from theese small bays. My pb was never on the scale but meassured 33.5 by 28.75 and was taken on a bolt rig at dawn. A good friend of mine landed one much larger than that on his first trip and many many larger fish are spotted each trip in the clear shollow sandy bays near my home on southern GB. Lots of big mirrors here too.Theese fish are more than plentiful and see very little pressure so pm me if you are interested in giving it a try.
423626,Roy,2010-01-18 19:59:00,13728,Bulging eyes like that is usually caused by carp pox.
423627,purekgw,2010-01-18 20:00:00,585,the grand river is really good for them if u do some recon and know the right time of year biggest we ever got was around 35lb tho
423632,CLofchik,2010-01-18 20:30:00,854,"Largest I've seen on a scale was 48lb and change out of Desjardins in June, but this was before the Barrier when the city & RBG were running their carp elimination derbies and hauling away a few tons of carp with front end loaders & dump trucks  The Harbour really is just a shadow of it's former glory since the Carp Barrier went up, a study was done a few years ago and they found carp pops have dropped almost 2/3's and all that fish producing potential has gone into......bullheads.  Half of the fish biomass in the Bay is now mudpouts, awesome."
423649,Paully,2010-01-18 21:45:00,712,Seen a couple of brutes swimming around lovesick lake a few times... never could get one to bite thou the biggest i've ever caught was close to 30..
423662,bucktail,2010-01-18 22:17:00,1857,"I cant imagine a better place for numbers of big carp then Quinte , the biggest I have caught is 34 lbs but have seen many I thought would be over forty. I really dont think I have seen a 50 but without seeing one before its hard to tell."
423714,Fang,2010-01-19 00:34:00,1330,Yeah another good one BT. Quinte has lots and very big ones too!! Seen some beast in Hay Bay over the years
423996,StoneFly,2010-01-19 22:48:00,574,"Mouth of the Credit in Early spring, I use to live in the highrise and looked directly down onto 100's, some must have been close to 50lbs.  Also Lake O harbour, near cherry Street was doing some work one day down there, took 30 min to fish by the old tanker beached by the Docks,...First Cast pulled the biggest carp I have ever seen from beneath the boat, he followed my spinner for about 20 ', then left and never came back."
