445004,Hud,2010-03-18 15:03:00,140,Reading these posts on Pike fishing in Zone 17 I was wondering if anyone knew if Canal lake had opened up enough to launch a boat or if it was still iced over? thanks!
445008,Matt15,2010-03-18 15:11:00,107,I was wondering the same about lake dalyrmpal
445016,Tom McCutcheon,2010-03-18 15:35:00,627,Can't help you there fellows. All I know is that The tri-lakes are NOT open enough yet to put a boat in.
445048,Drew_10,2010-03-18 16:44:00,111,"Still frozen from what I've seen, and the water is real lower in the lower end of the lake towards Gamebrige. The ice is thin though so it won't be long.  Dalrymple was frozen over a few days ago, so I assume it still is."
445057,Hud,2010-03-18 17:08:00,140,Thanks for the info guys.  Itching to help do my part for the musky fishery
445157,Rizzo,2010-03-18 22:28:00,4754,kempenfelt bay is still frozen in Barrie so I'd imagine these other lakes have a bit to go still
