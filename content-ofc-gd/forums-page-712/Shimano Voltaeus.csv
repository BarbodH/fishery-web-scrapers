444988,TJQ,2010-03-18 14:21:00,7806,Quit stalking me...  and ua just HAD to post a picture ocf camp.. like Im not Jonesing enough... 
444000,TJQ,2010-03-15 14:20:00,7806,"JP showed me these rods at the Spring Fishing Show, and I was impressed with them then!!!  This video is pretty awesome.   Next time I'm at BPS  im picking a couple up for sure.  "
444004,Roy,2010-03-15 14:42:00,13728,WOW! Heavy duty clip for sure. I'll pick up one of those as well.
444006,Lunatic,2010-03-15 14:54:00,536,"Thats cool, i was seriously thinking about picking one of these up when i heard about them. as long as it dont have that 'whippy' feeling like the ugly sticks ,i will probably pick one up for my back up rig"
444031,kickingfrog,2010-03-15 16:21:00,8333, One rod can not be all things to all conditions. At least that's what I tell my wife when I go tackle shoppin'.
444091,asdve23rveavwa,2010-03-15 20:48:00,2690,"Okay, musky guys...any opinions on this rod for casting bucktails???"
444099,pikeie,2010-03-15 21:00:00,380,"look like great rods! but did u seriously see how much longer it took dave to get his shark in, compaired to the other dude using what i would call the right equipment lol it was good for a laugh lol"
444101,asdve23rveavwa,2010-03-15 21:04:00,2690,"Made for a great fight, but, definitely would put alot more stress on the fish.  Part of the reason why I asked the ""musky"" question."
444103,Jer,2010-03-15 21:09:00,1426,   That'll get you arrested in Switzerland...
444123,JPD,2010-03-15 21:45:00,296,"The point wasn't about the power of the rod, it was about the durability. The Voltaeus rods were designed to be significantly lighter than traditional ""unbreakable"" rods, with more sensitivity, equivalent pricing, more technique specific models and lastly an unprecedented Limited Lifetime Warranty for less than $60.  The sheer fact that Dave was able to run line rated way higher than the rod was recommended for and lean on the fish, eventually getting it to the boat speaks volumes for the quality of the product. If he wanted to really hide the fact that a ""shark rod"" would bring the fish in faster he easily could have but again that wasn't what he was trying to say... it was solely to demonstrate the toughness.  Here's a piece of the press release for them:  And here are the models and actions:  JP"
444137,dannyboy,2010-03-15 22:17:00,367,"So I guess that would make these an ""unbreakable"", lighter, more sensitive rod than the ugly-type rods?  Sounds like a good thing, $60 makes them especially attractive.  Dan"
444143,Roy,2010-03-15 22:29:00,13728,"Yeah, you got that right for sure JP. Of course they're not shark rods, they used a shark do demonstrate the rod's durability. Unless they start making rods longer than 7', I won't be buying one for casting big baits....I need 8'+ for that or my back will take a serious beating after a couple of hours casting. Could be an interesting choice for trolling though. I'll get one this season though."
444148,Pigeontroller,2010-03-15 22:56:00,2793,Too bad they are so UGLY!
444176,TJQ,2010-03-16 00:03:00,7806,"VTC70ML 7' Medium Light Fast 6-15 5-15 1/8-5/8 1 3"" 9""  Thats the one i want!!!  actually two!!!"
444181,JPD,2010-03-16 00:11:00,296,Hey! I thought you preferred 2 piece rods?
444182,JPD,2010-03-16 00:13:00,296,This is the one that is 2 piece TJ.. 
444183,Roy,2010-03-16 00:16:00,13728,All of TJ's rods are 2 pieces or more...whether he bought them that way or not.
444187,JPD,2010-03-16 00:37:00,296,Does that include the night time extension Roy?
444188,TJQ,2010-03-16 00:39:00,7806," LOL.. that's a fact.. ya its the two piece one im interested in..   with all the 4 wheeler stuff I do, one pieces just don't work."
444194,asdve23rveavwa,2010-03-16 00:48:00,2690, Worth keeping an eye on for sure!!
444195,tb4me,2010-03-16 00:49:00,3295,"Ha ha ha, now thats funny I think I may pick one up for trolling this spring!"
444197,TJQ,2010-03-16 00:52:00,7806, I have to admit... ive broken my share of rods.. thats a fact..    Im gonna get a couple of these to try though.. ill test 'em out.    I like a light rod so Ill get the lightest action they have.  JP wrote a great primer on rod specs...  http://ontarioangler.com/fishingrods.html
444198,irishfield,2010-03-16 00:54:00,26272,"Don't leave them sticking out the side of your boat and they won't get broken when a guy with no reverse tries to ""dock"" beside it!!!  "
444259,fish-miester,2010-03-16 02:28:00,864,hmm tempting
444948,fish_fishburn,2010-03-18 11:58:00,1311,"I will definitely have a look at those rods.  The price point is very good. Not trying to steal this thread but, question for Irish. How much is a plane like that worth and how much to get a licence? Always wanted to learn to fly."
444985,irishfield,2010-03-18 14:14:00,26272,fishburn.. I built the plane and floats myself.. send me a PM if you want details...
