444341,backbay,2010-03-16 13:14:00,773,"I haven't been in years, but will hop on the TTC and go down there, maybe Friday. The $5 after 5 is a pretty fair shake."
444344,4thgen,2010-03-16 13:24:00,157,"I haven't been since the year after I stopped working at the trout pond. Leo and Steve (Fish On) got the contract with a cheaper offer and put in a free dark bottom pond. I used to love wandering around before and after hours, riding on the security golf carts etc. Free pizza at close was also a big highlight back in the day."
444368,torco,2010-03-16 14:50:00,656,  She not bad but I find her annoying sometimes on her show...Give me April Vokey from Fly Max  Seriously though I probably won't attend this year and mainly I find parking to be an issue.
444375,MJL,2010-03-16 15:11:00,2427," Agreed.  Ms Vokey's not going to be at the show unfortunately .  I love what she can do with a big, long rod like the one I have…Double handed fly rod of course  With that said…Nothing wrong with watching both on TV for tips...  Have a funeral/visitation to go to tomorrow...Heading to the show Thursday instead around 5pm."
444377,tibbs,2010-03-16 15:15:00,650,"I always go during my march break. It's pretty cheap entertainment considering the gate ticket costs as much as a movie ticket nowadays. It's a different story when i start to buy things though.  Also, since i live in the city there are no tackle stores around(unless i want to go to places where i'll to get stabbed).   I always have a great time checking out all the new fishing stuff in person,rather then just the internet."
444380,torco,2010-03-16 15:28:00,656,  Yes of course you meant the Spey Rod. Oh man too funny.  On a serious note sorry for your loss.
444392,bigugli,2010-03-16 16:33:00,6138,"I'd have to agree with CPH.  The show is a shadow of it's former self, but that slide began long before the dominance of the internet. What was purely an outdoors show for sportsmen has become more of a recreational show catering to all the new fads and trendy things that people spend wads of money on. Last time I was there ( 4 years back) I counted 6 sock dealers, 4 bikini booths, lost count of the t-shirt dealers, wake boards, waterskis, jetskis, also manner of extreme adventure tours, packages and gimmicks. Half of the show is power toys. Fishing and hunting might take up a sixth of the show.   What does a cheerleader squad have to do with fishing (beyond getting Ron and Leo excited?) Our modern urban society does not value the outdoors in the way we did, and still do. They don't fish and hunt, a lot don't even have a clue where their food comes from. Nature is something they fear and revere, but like to view with a foolish childlike curiosity. The outdoors is just another place for showing off expensive toys and tearing up the ground ( to the detriment of the outdoors itself)."
444399,Lunkerhunter,2010-03-16 16:46:00,455,"i will be going,  i always enjoy speaking with the lodge reps and getting a feel of the lodge from them  its also nice to walk around see all the gear in person and hopefully score on a few deals.  i also think its just another excuse to look at fishing crap for me. haha  cheers"
444428,Blake,2010-03-16 19:08:00,418,"First year in many I will not be going and I am thankful for the break as I am usually there on the retailer side.  Most people attending have no idea of the time, effort and expense it takes for manufacturers and retailers to attend these shows.  I hope it is a good show. It is good for the industry and enables many individuals to get introduced into our great sport.  It is a great way to see the newest gear from manufacturers and see the products that you want to buy or just interested in."
444462,danbouck,2010-03-16 20:56:00,4380," Update: I am now going, I got free tickets."
444464,superdad,2010-03-16 21:01:00,353,"We're headed to the Big Smoke on a Mega Bus from Kingston, there and back - no driving, no GO train, just a walk from the bus depot to Front St.  Gonna meet some friends, have a brown pop, talk to some people, check out the grab bins find the odd treasure there.  Gets us in the mood for the fishing season - OH Yea it's still on - out or some more Browning action on the weekend..........................  If you see a couple of older guys wearing the 2009 Trenton Walleye Derby Hats (YELLOW) say hello to Superdad.  Cheers  David  aka  Superdad"
444546,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-03-17 02:02:00,0,"I always enjoy the Sportsman show. Not as much deals as there used to be, though it is a nice fishing fix. It helps me through the off season. Plus you get to see a lot of guys you haven't seen in awhile and talk fishing. I'll probably go.  I too am worried about parking. Are they charging for parking?"
444560,Mykester,2010-03-17 02:31:00,241,"Can't go this year, I'm going next year when I actually have money to spend."
444564,raptorfan,2010-03-17 02:45:00,126," Nice, where did ya score them?  I know FM96 out of London is giving them away all this week, trying to score myself some of them."
444576,Radnine,2010-03-17 03:36:00,1538,    I am ONLY going if I can find some cheap or free tickets. Jim
444577,GoneFishin,2010-03-17 03:39:00,349,"Do they even have good deals at the sportsman show? You would think, with the stores having to pay the fee for them to be there, transporting gear and using extra staff that every thing would cost more then at your local fishing store. I'm thinking about going just to check it out. Haven't been in about 5 years now.."
444596,Radnine,2010-03-17 10:27:00,1538,"  I think that there are deals to be had, they just might be on things that you don't necessarily need. At the boat show this year I saw everyone walking around with mooring poles. Someone must have been giving them away, but I already had one. I think that you also have to keep in mind that there is almost no deal by the time you add cost to get there and cost to get in etc. Which brings it back to what I look at it as; a day out to look at fishing/outdoors stuff. Le Baron does have their no tax event and so do many of the fishing retailers (keeping up with the Joneses). I'll tell you what I start to feel weird about is talking to boat vendors etc. when I know that I am not going to buy anything, Ya know? Same really with the outfitters that are there. My son enjoys shooting a bow and arrow and blasting away at the paint ball booth and a couple of years ago went for an elephant ride (where else can you do that?) Jim"
444598,pikehunter,2010-03-17 11:10:00,1659,"NOPE! I will not fight the traffic to or in T.O., battle for a parking spot   then be ripped off for renting that piece of pavement for a few hours   or endure the ride on the GO Train just so I can have the displeasure my wallet drained at the gate and then again for food and drinks.  I can see about all I want to see at Fishing World, Bass Pro, LeBaron's or Bill's and not have to put up with all of the above.  When I was young I looked forward   to it every year, a nice change, a little bit of entertainment   and a sign that winter was just about over. But that was then, the last time I went I decided that was it.  I cannot picture the Sportsman Show being in the convention centre, it can't be anywhere close to the same atmosphere as the CNE."

444860,smitter,2010-03-18 00:36:00,106,"I used to love going when I lived down there, not even for the fishing stuff necessarily, the dogs were my favorite.  Unfortunately it's way too far to go now."
444882,tibbs,2010-03-18 02:07:00,650,"I went today... it was the same old same old. My major issue was that in order to get to the hunting, outfitter, and dog part of the show, you had to walk for about 5 mins from the fishing section. It was quite annoying. There weren't to many deals as well. The only decent deal that I found was $10 for 4 packs of powerbait. But, other then that I had a good time checking out all the new fishing stuff.    I also picked up some swimbaits to try out this year."
444987,Steel28,2010-03-18 14:15:00,160,went yesterday as well..same impression as your Tibbs.
444077,craigdritchie,2010-03-15 20:05:00,1586,"The Toronto Sportsmen's Show opens on Wednesday and runs through Sunday, March 21 at the Metro Convention Centre.  With the show having moved from the CNE to the Convention Centre this year, do you plan to attend? Why?  If you don't plan to go, then why not?  Just curious."

444080,crappieperchhunter,2010-03-15 20:15:00,2582,Stopped  doing the sports shows at least 10 years ago. They are all shadows of what they once where. I'd rather spend my day off fishing.
444082,raptorfan,2010-03-15 20:25:00,126,"Haven't been to the show in 19 years, so am gonna make a trip down this year.  Kids are excited to go as well."
444083,solopaddler,2010-03-15 20:26:00,8605,Not going either but your poll doesn't cover the reasons why.
444085,MJL,2010-03-15 20:29:00,2427,Going down with my dad possibly on Wednesday – No real purpose of going other than the fact we’re both free and have nothing better to do in the evening.  First time going to the Sportsmen show in almost 10 yrs.  Taking the TTC down so parking won’t be an issue.  Eating an early dinner and then going down for 5pm – we don’t expect to spend more than 3hrs there anyway.  Admission is $5 which isn’t too bad.  Might pick up a new fishing baseball hat if I can find one that fits or is free – Been wearing my lucky hat since high-school (unwashed   )
444086,Roy,2010-03-15 20:31:00,13728,"I suspect that more than a few in the community who answer yes to the poll have no choice as they're working manning a booth for their association, lodge/outfitter or employer."
444095,asdve23rveavwa,2010-03-15 20:56:00,2690,"Hey, Craig!  I voted no, for a few reasons...the cost and the crowds being the two main ones.  Also, these days with the internet it is so easy to look up any lodge/resort/tackle etc, etc."
444107,MJL,2010-03-15 21:16:00,2427,"I heard through the grapevine Mariko Izumi might be at the show...That's another great reason to go  ""Ms Izumi...Will you sign my T-shirt?"""
444113,JohnF,2010-03-15 21:27:00,3494, As long as you don't lose control and beg to sign hers.  JF
444116,Roy,2010-03-15 21:32:00,13728," Mike, Mike Mike......you just want her to TOUCH your T-Shirt. If she does, the shirt will end up like your baseball cap....never ever washed."
444118,charlesn,2010-03-15 21:34:00,551," You raise an interesting point crappieperchhunter.  I've discussed this with a number of people and I wonder if it is also a matter of perspective.  I recall back when I first attended, it was like Xmas again.  I had been buying gear at Canadian Tire and learned about places like Lucky Lou's and Lebaron and Fishing Plus and others.  It was awesome.  It was still nothing but a giant infomercial/flea market, but hey it was new and exciting and killed time in the winter.  Plus lots of lodges to gather propaganda from to plan the yearly trips.  Foolishly sold my self to the telemarketers by entering ""free draws"" and the whole nine.  Probably the highlight of those early trips was getting a free Export A hat signed by Italo and Henry way back before they got busted for poaching.  I remember Italo asked what I fished for and I said mostly bass and pike, and he wrote ""Good luck with those Walleyes!""...  Wish I had kept the hat!!!  As time went on, it got less and less interesting to attend as a consumer.  Then I started attending as an ""expert"" (so-called) to help consumers with their purchasing decisions.  That got tired even quicker than being a consumer.  Now when I go - it is to see friends and/or help out with a non-profit club org so I can at least feel I spent my time doing some good.  I already know about most new products because of the internet.  I can also find pretty much every cottage that goes to the show on-line.  If I buy a boat, chances are good it will be from someone I know or the states.  I did make an emergency trip down there a few years ago to ride an elephant with my daughter which is not something I can do easily elsewhere.  The Camels at the zoo scare me.  lol  So I'm wondering did the shows really change all that much or has my perspective changed?  I know I am much more jaded in my viewpoint than I used to be and much more experienced as an angler.  Surely that impacts my perspective.  I answered absolutely, but the complaints you list are very legit.  I'll meet a buddy at Yorkdale, grab breakfast and then TTC down and then we'll hit Bass Pro after.  I have to admit I'm quite curious to see what the new digs are like."
444134,DRIFTER_016,2010-03-15 22:08:00,10439,"Solo and I were discussing the shows just last week and he brought up a very good point. That being the internet being the downfall of these shows. Since the net became popular you see fewer and fewer exhibitors, especially outfitters. Back in the day the only way they could drum up business was to attend the shows, but now they use the internet to advertise their services. If you are looking to go on a fly out somewhere just Google it and you can spend hours pouring through info on the area you want to go to. Back in the day you had to go to the show, see the outfitters and pick up a brochure. Even tackle shops are selling there wears on the internet and don't bother to hit the shows. LeBaron's used to have a huge presence at the shows, then several years back they stopped going."
444141,castgame,2010-03-15 22:26:00,161,"your poll options don't cover all the bases... i'll probably be going, mostly to score some good deals and take the gf out for a day. she'll get a kick out of it at least. anybody know of admissions coupons or promotions? i don't feel like paying the whole price..."
