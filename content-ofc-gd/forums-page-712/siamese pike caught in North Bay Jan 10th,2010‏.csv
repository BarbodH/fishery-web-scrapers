444393,The Urban Fisherman,2010-03-16 16:34:00,2050,"WOW! North Bay didn't get very much snow this year! haha  Yeah dude, that's been around the block and back again.  Cheers, Ryan"

444409,dobee,2010-03-16 17:17:00,301,i heard that was caught in jordan harbour!!
444410,Rizzo,2010-03-16 17:18:00,4754,"haha good one Rick. Both of those pictures must have been posted here about 10-15 separate occasions each time with a different story. Hey, at least its been about 2 months since the last siamese pike sighting...that's pretty good."
444411,Meegs,2010-03-16 17:28:00,249,has it only been 2 months?    i seem to come across this picture it seems once a week!
444412,anders,2010-03-16 17:33:00,1168,I clicked this post thinking maybe its a different one...nope...disappointed

444421,Fisherman,2010-03-16 18:36:00,7201,"That was caught in the Ganny, all that good polluted farm water."

444431,Fishing 24/7,2010-03-16 19:34:00,709,take 2 pike.  a. and b.    take pike a. and shove it in the gil plate of pike b. that is 2-3 lbs more.    giving you a mutant.  or just plain stupidity.
444434,craigdritchie,2010-03-16 19:43:00,1586,"Back when I worked for Real Fishing some guy mailed in a colour print of the original photo, swearing up and down he caught it in Hamilton Harbour and it was a genetic freak. We laughed since it was a obviously a copy of another picture, and seemed to be of two different fish, but we printed it in one of the issues anyway as a joke. That might have been around 1997 or 1998.  Wish I had a dollar for every time I've seen that picture since. I have no idea where who took the photo originally, or where, but I doubt many pike imagess have ever got so much mileage."
444497,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-03-16 23:19:00,158," Nevermind the farm water, its all the nuclear waste that may actually produce a fish like the three eyed one in the simpsons."

444519,CLofchik,2010-03-17 00:32:00,854,"Heh I remember seeing that pic for the first time in 1994 when it took 7 minutes to download off a newsgroup using Gopher running a 2600b/s modem.  I think I remember the guy that swore he caught it in Hamilton on the old Zoo board, he also caught a blue cat out of the Grand and thought the pinks running up Grindstone had ulcers from coal tar."
444652,mepps,2010-03-17 14:16:00,1301,Nicely done 24/7!
444675,MCTFisher9120,2010-03-17 15:35:00,3761,"Haha, I think I posted the same thing a year or two ago...We saw that pike that was caught jigging today in a Aquatics lecture. It was caught in Sakatchewan lol...or so the teacher claimed it to be"
444753,JPD,2010-03-17 19:35:00,296,Anybody notice that the pike on the left has it's head put on upside down compared to the body and fins?
444756,JPD,2010-03-17 19:41:00,296,Here's one that I was joking around with Mercer for a cover shot... he got a good laugh out of it! 
444832,Whitespinnerbait,2010-03-17 23:51:00,2038,Oh my God...   The only way for me to never see that pic again ..is for me to poke both eyes out with a dull pencil.....OUCH !!!!   Damn now i can't see the keyboard....
