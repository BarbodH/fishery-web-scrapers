442819,SBCregal,2010-03-12 03:15:00,688,"I plan on fixing my boat up a bit this spring, new wood for the seats etc and I was thinking of painting the inside of the boat.  I know about prepping it and all of that, but I was wondering if theres a colour that people prefer to paint the inside.  I want a colour that wont reflect the sunlight directly at me, and wont get stupid hot to the touch.  I've seen a lot of boats with a robins egg blue sort of paint on the inside, is there a reason for this? Can anyone give me an idea of what paint colour works.... heck, even what I should avoid.  thanks ryan"
442836,irishfield,2010-03-12 04:33:00,26272,Sand beige.. light grey... or the likes. Nothing I hate worse the Naden's green zinc primer interior..
442876,aplumma,2010-03-12 12:29:00,6896,good call Wayne Their is a reason they paint battleships gray. It helps to cut down on heat reflection and heat retention.   Art
442894,Fisherman,2010-03-12 13:40:00,7201,"Make sure it's not a glossy finish, semi or matt is better for less reflection."
442958,skeeter,2010-03-12 16:15:00,1907,what? bright yellow didnt make the cut?
442964,JohnF,2010-03-12 16:31:00,3494," Camouflage, so the enemy bombers can't find you as easily out on the lake.  Or mebbe it's the seagulls ....  JF"
442993,Paully,2010-03-12 17:57:00,712,I used beige rocker panel rubberized spray paint from Canadian tire... it sealed small leaks and it feels great on bare feet! It costs about 8 bucks a can..
443045,fish-miester,2010-03-12 20:18:00,864,  how did you like it? and does it come in other colours
443082,SBCregal,2010-03-12 22:09:00,688,"thanks. I was thinking either a tan or gray colour actually.  never thought of the rubberized rocker guard stuff though, how has it held up?  ryan"
444782,fish-miester,2010-03-17 21:41:00,864,was wonderin if the rubberized rocker guard came in the big cans so i could roll it on or does it only come in spray cans?
444795,SBCregal,2010-03-17 22:37:00,688,i've only ever seen it in spraycans...but i've never looked for it in anything but spraycans...i'll take a look in the next few days when i pick mine up.  ryan
444803,Paully,2010-03-17 22:54:00,712,"From what i remember it came in ""paint can"" size.."
445096,fish-miester,2010-03-18 19:19:00,864,that would be awesome. I was hoping to paint the inside of my boat .. and was hoping to just roll it on.. but if not im ok with cans
