444892,tschirk,2010-03-18 02:57:00,261,"Awesome! Did you look at other brands, Yammy, Suzuki, CanAm? What made you pick Honda? I am looking for a quad and can't decide between brands. Thx Ted"
444901,TJQ,2010-03-18 03:16:00,7806,"I have a 2005 version of that bike, it has been.. well awesome, never a problem, and is a pleasure to ride, performing beyond my expectations. Still runs like it did when I first bought it.  Snow plow in the winter, workhorse in the summer.  This bike is identical, except for the power steering which is handy for Monique.  For me, with the first one being such a quality bike there was no other option."
444904,pike slayer,2010-03-18 03:25:00,1177,"nice choice, honda makes a good quality bike"
445031,bigbuck,2010-03-18 16:04:00,2449,"Can't go wrong with a Honda. My f-in-law had a Yammie 650 quad and it was awesome to blast around on the logging and mining roads out Kenora way. ENJOY!!! When I was a kid I had a Honday XR100 that I kicked the snot out of and it never quit. Jeez, I miss riding.........Now to convince the missus that I need a Harley....."
