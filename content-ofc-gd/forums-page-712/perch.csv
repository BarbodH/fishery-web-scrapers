445507,BassAsin,2010-03-19 18:16:00,806,"here's just a couple pics of some perch we were gettin into this winter, we only kept the 14+"" ones anything smaller went back,  most of their gutus were filled with crayfish about 5 inches long weighing in at a pound plus, the total weight on these 7   was 6lbs 13oz.

445508,Roy,2010-03-19 18:38:00,13728,Congrats! Very impressive indeed. I'm pretty sure that they didn't come from Rice Lake.
445510,BassAsin,2010-03-19 18:43:00,806,"Thanks Roy,   not a chance they came from there, they were caught in a northern ontario lake called Nunya lake."
445513,blaque,2010-03-19 18:46:00,2419,"I've never been to Nunya, i wonder why that is?"
445514,Roy,2010-03-19 18:48:00,13728,"Yeah, we have a few of those lakes around here too!"
445516,terry71,2010-03-19 18:57:00,21,Keeping big perch of that size does not help the fishery in terms of reproduction. Those females are prime spawners. It is best to let them go and keep the smaller ones.  The huge decline in perch numbers on Lake Simcoe is for that reason. Ask any biologist. Nice fish though.
445518,NAW,2010-03-19 19:05:00,4022,"  Nice report, and some very nice hogs, but I have to agree with Terry..  Don't get me wrong, I do keep big perch, but I also keep smaller ones.  I don't go out and just target the hogs.."
445519,bushart,2010-03-19 19:05:00,2628,  I don't fish for them--so he can have my limit---and my sons'---and my daughters'--and missus painters'  Far as I know perch reproduce more than most want sometimes---Simcoe is a stand alone thing---surrounded by 5 million people  Bushart
445530,BassAsin,2010-03-19 19:29:00,806,"Thanks Bushart. guess with m y math skills i can keep ummmmm   lots.    i dont mean to stir the pot, but this is not southern ontario its northern ontario and the only 4 holes i found on the lake all year were mine, I supppose i didnt mention the 60 or 70 12-13 inchers i let go and i cant count how many 10 and 11's   how many of thatsize are considered big and get kept on simcoe, i dont have thye patience to clean 14 10 inchers when i can clean 7 big pigs, and i dont thin k i'm going to be doin the harm on this lake when the proposal for 60 cottages gets approved, i'll have wished i kep[t every one of the buggers then, with 4 trips into the lake throughout the year the two of us who went in kept a total of 23 fish.  seems fairly darn conservative to me, seeings how the government says its ok to keep 50."
445545,jimmer,2010-03-19 20:15:00,2730,"Seems reasonable to me.  The whole lake to yourself, must be nice.  Those are the places most of us dream about!"
445549,JohnF,2010-03-19 20:21:00,3494,  Well duuhh! Do they look frozen?  JF
